I apologize.\n 　　FRANCESCAWhat made you ask such a question?\n 　　ROBERTI thought that\u0027s what we weredoing -- asking questions.\n 　　FRANCESCA(defensive)I thought we were just having aconversation. You seem to be readingall this meaning into it. Meanings Imust be too simple to, uh...\n 　　interpret or something.\n 　　ROBERTI already apologized.\n 　　Silence. Robert remains seated. Francesca remains at the sink.\n 　　ROBERT (cont\u0027d)It\u0027s getting late.\n 　　(rises)Thank you for dinner.\n 　　Pause. Francesca feels badly.\n 　　FRANCESCAListen, I\u0027m sorry I --ROBERTNo, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake.\n 　　It was an inappropriate thing to ask.\n 　　FRANCESCA(shrugs it off, then:)... I feel like something\u0027s beenspoiled now.\n 　　Robert smiles and crosses to her. He takes her hand into bothhis hands.\n 　　ROBERTIt\u0027s been a perfect evening. Just theway it is. Thank you.\n 　　Francesca smiles. The possibility of a kiss hangs in the airbetween them until Robert turns to get his film out of thefridge. As he exits through the screen door, he stops.\n 　　ROBERT (cont\u0027d)One thing though -- don\u0027t kid yourself,Francesca. You\u0027re anything but asimple woman.\n 　　He smiles and exits, catching the screen door before itslams.\n 　　Francesca doesn\u0027t move for a moment, then crosses to the dooras if to run after him when she is stopped by the PHONERINGING. She picks up.\n 　　FRANCESCAHello?\n 　　RICHARD (on phone)Franny?\n 　　FRANCESCARichard, hi.\n 　　RICHARD (on phone)How are you?\n 　　FRANCESCAFine. Everyone settled in okay?\n 　　RICHARD (on phone)Just fine. We\u0027re all in one room.\n 　　Michael\u0027s on the couch andCarolyn\u0027s...\n 　　(continues...)She hears Robert\u0027s truck door open and close. She hears themotor being turned on. She half-listens to Richard.\n 　　FRANCESCAUh-uh... good... Hmmm...\n 　　She hears the truck driving away as Richard continues:\n 　　RICHARD (on phone)We got our position in the Fair. Notbad although I would have liked to bethird which is not too early and nottoo late. But I told Carolyn not toworry...\n 　　(continues, if needed)CUT TO:\n 　　INT. FRANCESCA BEDROOM - NIGHTFrancesca exits her bathroom, in her bathrobe, shutting thelight. She is brushing her hair and thinking of Robert. Shesits on the edge of the bed. She sees her reflection in amirror on the closet door.\n 　　She stands and takes her robe off. She steps forward to lookat her body -- running her hands gently around her curves, herneck, down the side of her thighs, her face, her breasts.\n 　　She shuts off the lights and gets into bed under the covers.\n 　　She closes her eyes and tentatively begins to explore herbody. It is awkward for her but we can see her trying to letherself go. Until she opens her eyes in frustration. It\u0027s nogood. She can\u0027t do it. She feels ashamed. The shame turnsinto anger.\n 　　INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHTFrancesca sits at a writing table with two large books openedbefore her containing literary quotations. She searches forthe line Robert mentioned in the pasture.\n 　　A note sits before her as well. On it reads: \"Robert. Again,I\u0027m sorry for last night. Would you like supper again tonightafter you\u0027re finished. I\u0027d like it very much if I were one ofthose good friends you have in the world. Anytime is fine --Francesca... P.S. By the way, \"Of what I call God and Foolscall Nature\" was...\" She writes the name BROWNING.\n 　　CUT TO:\n 　　EXT. ROSEMAN BRIDGE - NIGHTFrancesca is tacking a note for Robert to the bridge. Sheconsiders taking it down a moment later, but decides not to.\n 　　She gets back into her truck and drives away.\n 　　WIDE ANGLE OF BRIDGES - DAWNDISSOLVE TO:\n 　　The view of the bridge goes in and out of focus until werealize we are seeing it through Robert\u0027s camera lens.\n 　　Once the focus it sets, Robert notices something is tackedonto the bridge. He crosses to it hurriedly -- time for theperfect shot is running out -- pulls it down, thumbtack andall, and shoves it into his pocket, unread. He returns tohis camera to take his shots.\n 　　CUT TO:\n 　　INT. JOHNSON BEDROOM - MORNINGFrancesca is making her bed when she hears a truck drivingdown the road. She looks out the window to see:\n 　　Robert\u0027s truck. However, it passes right by her house.\n 　　Francesca\u0027s spirit sinks. She feels silly, ashamed andrejected. She sits on the bed.\n 　　FANTASY:\n 　　Inside the truck, Robert drives by the house and chuckles tohimself at the foolishness of some boring, frustratedhousewife. Francesca\u0027s note has been crumbled and stuffedinto a dirty ashtray.\n 　　END OF FANTASY:\n 　　Francesca enters her bathroom, slamming the door behind her.\n 　　INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT MORNINGFrancesca sits at the kitchen table in her bathrobe with acup of coffee -- a comic portrait of shame and self-pity. Herhair is a mess, she hasn\u0027t showered or dressed and she staresinto space while listening to the bluesy Chicago radiostation.\n 　　The sink is full of dirty dishes she refuses to clean. Besideit is an ashtray of butts from the night before. She carriesit over to the table and begins fingering for a butt tosmoke in desperation. She lights up and stares into space.\n 　　FANTASY:\n 　　Robert is in Africa talking to TWO ZULU TRIBE MEMBERS. THEDIALOGUE IS SUBTITLED IN SWAHILI:\n 　　ROBERT(laughs)... and then she tacks this note onthe bridge asking me to have dinnerwith her again!\n 　　One Zulu turns to the tower and remarks.\n 　　ZULUHow pathetic.\n 　　END OF FANTASY:\n 　　Francesca put out her cigarette and suddenly gets an idea.\n 　　She goes to the phone, reads a number off of a slip of paperand dials.\n 　　FRANCESCA (on phone)Hello? Is Richard Johnson stayingthere?... No, I don\u0027t want to leavea message. Maybe you can help me --I\u0027m his wife and I live in WintersetIowa -- I wanted to surprise them bydriving up tonight. What would be thefastest route, the Interstate?... Huh-huh... Hold it, let me get a pen.\n 　　CUT TO:\n 　　可是这里的生活还不止于此.可以预见是一回事,怕改娈又是一回事.理查德就是怕改变他们婚后生活的任何改变他都害怕.总的说来连谈也不愿意谈.特别不愿谈性爱.性感这东西对他说来是危险的,在他的思想方法中是不体面的.\n 　　可是他决不是绝无仅有的,而且也决不能责怪他.在这里树起的拒自由于外的屏障是什么?不仅存在于农场上,而是存在于乡村文化之中,就这一点而言,也可能是城市文化.为什么要树起这些围墙,篱笆来阻挠男女之间自然的关系?为什么缺少亲密的关系,为什么没有性爱妇女杂志正在谈论这些事,女人们开始不仅对自己生活中卧室里发生的事情有所期待,而且对自己在更大范围的设计图中的地位也有所期待.像理查德这样的男人-她猜想大多数男人-受到这捉期待的威胁.从某种意义上讲,女人正在要求男人们既是诗人同时又是勇猛而热情奔放的情人.\n 　　女人看不出二者之间有什么矛盾,男人们却认为是矛盾的.他们生活中的更衣室,男人的晚会,弹子房和男女分开的聚会都定出一套男性的特点,这里面是容不下诗间或者任何含蓄细致的情调的.所以,如果性爱是一种细致的感情,本身是一种艺术-弗朗西丝卡认为是的-那么,在他们的生活结构中是不存在的.于是男女双方在巧妙的互相应付中继续过着同床异梦的生活.与此同时女人们在麦迪逊县的漫漫长夜只有面壁叹息.\n 　　而罗伯特.金凯的头脑中有某种东西对这一切心领神会.这点她能肯定.\n 　　她披着毛巾走进卧室时注意到已经十点过了一点儿.天还很热,不过洗澡使她凉快下来.她从衣橱里拿出新衣服.\n 　　她把长长的头发拢到后面用一个银发卡卡住,戴上一幅大圈圈的银耳环,还有也是那天早晨在得梅音买的开口的银手镯.\n 　　还是\"风歌\"牌香水.在拉丁式的高颧骨的两颊薄施胭脂,那粉红色比她的衣服还要淡.她平时穿着短裤短衫在田间劳动而晒黑了的皮肤衬托得全套服饰更加鲜亮.裙子下面露出两条修长的腿,十分好看.\n 　　她在镜台前转过来又转过去打量自己.她想,我已是尽力而为了,然后又高兴地说出声,\"不过还是挺不错的.\"她走进厨房时罗伯特.金凯正在喝第二杯啤酒,并且在重新把相机装进包里.他抬头看着她.\"天哪,\"他柔声说.所有的感觉,所有的寻觅和苦思冥想,一生的感觉,寻觅和苦思冥想此时此刻都到眼前来.于是他爱上了弗朗西丝卡.约翰逊-多年前来自那不勒斯的,依阿华州麦迪逊县的农夫之妻.我想说,人,照得人眼花缭乱晕头转向.我是认真的.你是绝代美人,弗朗西丝卡,是从这个词的最纯正的意义上说.\"她可以感觉得出来他的倾慕是真诚的.她尽情享受这欢乐和得意,沐浴其中,听凭漩涡没顶,像是多年前抛弃了自己今又归来的不知何方仙女双手洒下的甘油浸透每个毛孔.\n 　　就在这一刹那间,她爱上了罗伯特.金凯-来自华盛顿州贝灵汉的,开着一辆名叫哈里的旧卡车的摄影家-作家.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/158/6094.html","bookId":328,"book":{"id":328,"title":"廊桥遗梦 The Bridges of Madison County","description":"简介： 卡洛琳和迈克是姐弟俩，他们婚姻生活很糟糕，都面临着家庭离异的困扰。正当他们不知何去何从时，突然收到了消息母亲弗朗西斯卡去世了，两个人急急忙忙赶回了童年时生活的乡村。在收拾母亲的遗物时，他们发现了母亲给他们留下的一封长信，深埋在她心底的一段感情秘密让姐...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/129246664320ad4.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/158","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:34 AM"}}
