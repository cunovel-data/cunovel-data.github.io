{"id":85808,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"SHE ALREADY FELT DRUNK, AND THOUGH SHE considered herself fairly adept, Layla didn\u0027t think she was quite adept enough to casually sip wine while he undressed her. By the time he slipped off the second stocking it was all she could do to set the glass aside without spilling it.\n He smiled, and pressed his lips to the arch of her foot. Excitement shot straight up to her belly, and pulsed there like a second agitated heart. He took his time, stirring and seducing, kindling little fires under her skin, exploiting odd and wondrous points of pleasure. When he gripped her ankles, slid her toward him in one smooth motion, she let out a sound of surprise and gratitude.\n Now their faces were close, so close the rich, golden brown of his irises mesmerized her. His hand-callused fingertips-glided up her legs, under her rucked-up skirt. Slowly, slowly. And down again while his mouth toyed with hers. A brush, a taste, a bare whisper of torturous contact even when her arms locked around his neck, even when her needy body pressed to his. Once again, the easy touch, the easy taste, left her drained and dazzled.\n His hands cupped her hips, lifted her. The quick shock had her gasping, instinct had her wrapping her legs around his waist as he rose with her. This time the kiss was deep and seeking as he stood with her eagerly twined around him.\n \"My head\u0027s actually spinning,\" she managed as he began to walk.\n \"I plan on keeping it that way awhile.\" In the bedroom, he sat on the side of the bed with her straddling him. \"I figured candlelight for the first time, but we\u0027ll have to save that.\"\n He trailed his fingers over her shoulders, over the soft wool of the pretty blue sweater, along the tiny pearl buttons down the front. \"You always look just right.\" He drew it down her arms to her elbows, left it there. \"You\u0027ve got a knack for it.\"\n With her arms roped in cashmere, he pressed his lips, just a light hint of teeth, to the side of her neck, down her skin to the edge of the little sweater she wore beneath.\n He loved the light tremor that ran through her, the sound of her breath quickening, thickening. And the look of her, flushed, just a little anxious. He ran his hands down her arms until both his fingers and the cashmere cuffed her wrists. Then he took her mouth, ravishing it, saturating himself with the taste of her, devouring the quick, helpless sounds she made while her pulse thundered under his hands.\n He eased back, a whisper back, and smiled into her dazed eyes. \"We\u0027ll save this one for later, too,\" he said and released her hands.\n He watched her face as he drew the little sweater up and away; he watched her face as he played his fingertips over her warm, bare skin. Then he pleased himself, looked down at breasts clothed in a fancy bra of blue lace. \"Yeah, you always look just right.\"\n Reaching behind her, he eased down the zipper of her skirt.\n She felt as if she moved through water, warm, softened with fragrance. Her heart thudded, slow and hard as she unbuttoned his shirt, as she found the hard muscles of his shoulders, his chest, his back. When he kissed her again, when he lowered her to her back, she was the water. Warm, soft, and fluid. His hands, his lips played over her, tirelessly, relentlessly. She had no defense against them, against her own need, and wanted none. When he freed her breasts, she arched to him. Thrilled to the steady greed of his lips, of his tongue.\n He worked down her, coating her with pleasure until he drew the matching lace away and exposed her.\n Then came the whirlpool. She was caught in it, a mad spin that dragged her under to where the water whirled hot and fast. She cried out, shocked, her hands fisting in the sheets for purchase as the orgasm ripped through her. Even when she sobbed out his name, he didn\u0027t stop. When she came again, it was like going mad.\n Her body quivered and writhed under him, clawing at what was left of his control. She sprawled over the tangled sheets in absolute surrender while the dim light of the dying evening spilled over her and sheened her in gold. Once more he cupped her hips, lifted them. Once more his eyes met hers, held hers as he filled her. As he trapped himself inside her. He watched her eyes as he thrust deep. Watched them as he took her, and as she wrapped tight to take him.\n Watched until they closed on the peak of her pleasure, and until his own needs swallowed him whole.\n SHE WASN\u0027T SURE SHE COULD MOVE, OR THAT THE bones in her body would ever solidify again and hold her upright.\n She wasn\u0027t sure she cared.\n He sprawled on top of her, dead weight, and that didn\u0027t seem to matter either. She liked his weight, his warmth, liked feeling the thunder of his heartbeat so she knew she hadn\u0027t been the only one to fly.\n She\u0027d known he\u0027d be gentle, and that he\u0027d be fun. But she hadn\u0027t known he\u0027d be... astonishing.\n \"Want me to move?\" His voice was thick, just a little sleepy.\n \"Not especially.\"\n \"Good, \u0027cause I like it here. I\u0027ll get the wine and maybe order us some dinner at some point.\"\n \"No hurry.\"\n \"Got a question.\" He brushed his lips over her cheek as he lifted his head. \"Do you always match your underwear to your clothes?\"\n \"Not always. But often. I\u0027m a little obsessive.\"\n \"Really worked for me.\" He toyed with the glittery chain she wore around her neck. \"So does this, or the fact that this and earrings are all you\u0027re wearing.\" He lowered his head again to kiss her, and while he lingered over it, released the chain to rub his thumbs over her nipples. His lips curved to hers when she let out a little moan.\n \"I was hoping you\u0027d say that,\" he murmured and slipped inside her again, hard as steel.\n Her eyes went wide. \"How can you-don\u0027t you have to... Oh God. Oh God.\"\n \"You\u0027re all soft now. Wet and soft and even more sensitive than the first time.\" He moved in her, long, long, slow thrusts, leaving her shuddering on each stroke. \"I\u0027ll take you deeper this time. Close your eyes, Layla. Let yourself take what I\u0027m giving you.\"\n She had no choice; she was beyond will. Her body was so heavy, while inside it a thousand small eruptions burst. He touched her, his hands alighting needs she thought had gone quiet.\n So she went deeper, into pleasure both intense and foreign.\n \"Don\u0027t stop. Don\u0027t.\"\n \"Not until you get there.\"\n When she did, it was like plummeting out of the sky, a tumbling free fall that stole the breath.\n SHE WAS STILL LIMP WHEN HE BROUGHT HER A glass of wine. \"I ordered pizza. That okay?\"\n She managed a nod. \"How do you... Can you always recover that quickly?\"\n \"One of the perks.\" He sat cross-legged on the bed with his own glass of wine, and cocked his head. \"Hasn\u0027t Quinn mentioned it? Come on, I know your breed talks about sex.\"\n \"Mentioned... Well, she said it\u0027s the best sex of her life, if that\u0027s what you mean. And that he\u0027s...\" She felt very strange, talking about their friends this way. \"Well, he\u0027s got amazing staying power.\"\n \"You know how we heal fast, since that night? Sort of the same thing here.\"\n \"Oh.\" She drew the word out, and slaked her thirst with wine. \"That is a very fine perk.\"\n \"It\u0027s a particular favorite of mine.\" He rose, walked around the room lighting candles.\n Yes, yes, she thought, that was a very nice ass. His hair tumbled messily around that sharp-featured face. Those gilded eyes were satisfied, and just a little sleepy.\n She wanted to lap him up like melted chocolate.\n \"What\u0027s your record?\"\n He glanced back and grinned. \"What time frame? An evening, an overnight, a lost weekend?\"\n Over the rim of her glass her eyes challenged him. \"We\u0027ll start with an evening, and I bet we can beat it.\"\n They ate pizza in bed. The pie was cold by the time they got to it, but they were both too ravenous to care. The music changed to B. B. King, and the candles wafted out lovely light and fragrance.\n \"My mother makes them,\" he told her when she commented.\n \"Your mother makes candles-gorgeous, fragrant candles-throws pots, and does watercolors.\"\n \"And weaves. Does other needlework when the mood strikes.\" He licked sauce off his thumb. \"Now if only she\u0027d cook real food, she\u0027d be perfect.\"\n \"Are you the only carnivore in the family?\"\n \"My father sneaks a Big Mac now and then, and Sage fell off the veggie wagon, too.\" He contemplated another slice of pizza. \"I decided to do it.\"\n \"To do what?\"\n \"To, ah, give Sage-or I guess it would be give Paula- the magic elixir.\"\n \"The... Oh.\" She angled her head. \"What made you decide?\"\n \"I just figured I\u0027m not doing anything with it, right at the moment. And they\u0027re family. If I can help make them happy, help give them a family, why wouldn\u0027t I?\"\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t you?\" she repeated quietly, then took his face in her hands to kiss him. \"You\u0027re one in a million.\"\n \"Let\u0027s hope I\u0027ve got one or two in a million that\u0027ll get the job done for them. I know it\u0027s a strange thing to bring up under the current conditions, but I thought you should know. Some women might find it a little weird, or off-putting. I\u0027m not getting that you do.\"\n \"I think it\u0027s loving, and lovely.\" She kissed him again, just before the phone rang.\n \"Hold that thought.\" He scooted back to answer the bedside phone. \"Hey. Oh yeah.\" He tipped the phone to address Layla. \"It\u0027s Cal. No, we\u0027ll get to that tomorrow. It can wait until tomorrow. Because I\u0027m with Layla,\" he said. He hung up the phone, looked at her. \"I\u0027m with Layla.\"\n SHE HADN\u0027T MEANT TO SPEND THE NIGHT, AND was vaguely surprised by the sun streaming through the windows. \"Oh my God. What time is it?\"\n She started to roll out of bed, was rolled right back and under Fox. \"It\u0027s morning, it\u0027s early. What\u0027s the rush?\"\n \"I have to get home, change. Fox!\" Amusement, arousal, and sheer bafflement warred inside her as his hands got busy under the covers. \"Stop.\"\n \"That\u0027s not what you said last night. How many times was that?\" He laughed as his mouth covered hers. \"Relax. So you\u0027ll be a little late. I can guarantee your boss won\u0027t mind.\"\n Later, a great deal later while she hunted up her second stocking, he offered her a can of Coke. \"Sorry, it\u0027s the only caffeine on the premises.\"\n She winced at it, then shrugged. \"It\u0027ll have to do. It\u0027s a good thing you don\u0027t have an appointment until ten thirty, because I\u0027m barely going to make it into the office by ten.\"\n He watched her slip her foot into the hose. \"Maybe I should help you with that.\"\n \"Stay away from me.\" She laughed, but pointed a finger at him. \"I mean it. It\u0027s almost business hours.\" She drew up the stocking, slipped on her shoes. \"I\u0027ll be in the office as soon as I can manage it.\"\n \"I\u0027ll drive you home.\"\n \"Thanks, but I\u0027ll walk. I think I need some air.\" She stood, pointed at him again. \"Hands up.\" When he grinned, held up his hands, she leaned in to kiss him.\n Then she escaped before she could change her mind.\n Her hopes to dash straight upstairs when she got home were scotched as Cybil stood on the bottom landing, leaning on the banister. \"Ah, look who\u0027s doing the Walk of Shame. Hey, Q, baby sister\u0027s home.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got to change and get to work. Talk later.\"\n She made the dash, but Cybil was right behind her. \"Oh no, you don\u0027t. Talk while you change.\"\n Since Quinn swung out of the office and into Layla\u0027s bedroom with Cybil, Layla gave up.\n \"Obviously, I spent the night with Fox.\"\n \"Playing chess?\" Quinn grinned as Layla stripped on her way to the shower. \"Isn\u0027t that his game?\"\n \"We never got to that. Maybe next time.\"\n \"From the smile on your face, it\u0027s obvious he has a few other games,\" Cybil commented.\n \"I feel...\" She jumped into the shower. \"Used and energized, amazed and stupefied.\" She whipped the shower curtain back an inch. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me about the perk?\" she demanded. \"About how they recover, sexually, the same way they heal?\"\n \"Didn\u0027t I mention that?\"\n \"No.\" It was Cybil who answered, giving Quinn a hard poke.\n \"Speaking of energy, the Energizer Bunny is a worn-out, sluggish rabbit comparatively.\" Quinn gave Cybil a sympathetic hug. \"I didn\u0027t want to make you feel sad and deprived, Cyb.\"\n Cybil just narrowed her eyes. \"How many times? And don\u0027t try to tell me you didn\u0027t count,\" she added as she pulled the shower curtain open.\n Layla pulled it back, then stuck out a hand, five fingers spread.\n \"Five?\"\n Then put the tips of her pinky and thumb together to add another three.\n \"Eight? Holy Mother of God.\"\n Layla switched off the shower, grabbed a towel. \"That\u0027s not counting twice this morning. I have to admit, I\u0027m a little tired, and I\u0027m starving. And I\u0027d kill for coffee.\"\n \"You know what?\" Cybil said after a moment. \"I\u0027m going to go down and scramble you some eggs, pour you a giant cup of coffee. Because right at the moment, you\u0027re my hero.\"\n Quinn stayed behind as Layla, wrapped in the towel, rubbed lotion on her arms and legs. \"He\u0027s a sweetie.\"\n \"I know he is.\"\n \"Are you going to be able to work together, sleep together, and fight the forces of evil together?\"\n \"You\u0027re managing it with Cal.\"\n \"Which is why I ask, because the combination can have its moments. I guess I wanted to say that if you run into one of those moments, you can talk to me.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been able to talk to you from the first. I guess that\u0027s one of our perks.\" Because it was true, Layla considered as she drew on her robe. \"My feelings for him, for just about everything right now, are tangled and confused. And for just about the first time in my life, confusion isn\u0027t such a bad thing.\"\n \"Good enough. Well, try not to work too hard today because we\u0027re having a summit meeting tonight. Cal wants to know what Fox came up with.\"\n \"About what?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Quinn pursed her lips. \"He didn\u0027t mention anything to you? A theory.\"\n \"No. No, he didn\u0027t.\"\n \"Maybe he\u0027s still working it out. In any case, we\u0027ll talk about whatever we talk about tonight.\"\n By the time Layla got to the office, Fox was already in and on the phone. With his next client due in shortly after, it wasn\u0027t the time, in her opinion, to pin him down about their other collaboration and theories.\n She checked his schedule, hunting for a reasonable span of free time, then stewed while she worried about why he hadn\u0027t mentioned anything about it to her.\n When Sage came in just as Layla was about to take advantage of a lull, Layla decided she was outnumbered for the workday.\n \"Fox gave me a call, asked me to come by. Is he free now?\"\n \"As a bird.\"\n \"I\u0027ll just go on back.\"\n Thirty minutes passed before Sage came out again. It was obvious she\u0027d been crying even when she sent Layla a brilliant smile. \"Just in case you\u0027re not aware, you\u0027re working for the most amazing, most beautiful, most incredible man in the entire universe. Just in case you didn\u0027t know,\" she added, and ran out.\n With a sigh, Layla tried to bury her own questions-and the annoyance that had been working up through them- and went back to see how Fox had weathered what must have been an emotional half hour.\n He sat at his desk with the look of a man who was seriously worn at the edges. \"She cried,\" he said immediately. \"Sage, she\u0027s not much of a crier, but she sure cut loose.\n Then she called Paula, and Paula cried. I\u0027m feeling a little overwhelmed, so if crying\u0027s on your agenda, could we get a continuance?\"\n Saying nothing, Layla walked to his fridge, got him a Coke.\n \"Thanks. I\u0027ve got an appointment to... Since I just had a physical a few months ago, they\u0027re sending my records to the place where they do it. Sage, she\u0027s got a friend in Hagerstown who\u0027s her doctor. So I\u0027ve got-we\u0027ve got-an appointment day after tomorrow, and the day after, since Paula\u0027s going to be...\"\n \"Ovulating?\"\n He winced. \"Even with my upbringing, I\u0027m not completely at ease with all this. So day after tomorrow. Eight. I\u0027ve got court, so I\u0027ll just go there after.\" He rose, put a dollar in the jar. \"This is fucking bizarre. There, that\u0027s better. So what\u0027s up next?\"\n \"I am. Quinn told me you were supposed to meet with Cal and Gage last night, and that you wanted to meet with them to tell them about a theory you have.\"\n \"Yeah, then I got a better offer, so...\" He trailed off. He knew that look in her eyes. \"That pisses you off?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. It depends. But it certainly baffles me that you have an idea you think worth discussing with your men friends, and not with me.\"\n \"I would have discussed it with you, but I was busy enjoying mutual multiple orgasms.\"\n True, she had to admit. But not altogether the point. \"I was with you all day in this office, all night in bed. I think there was time in that frame to bring this up.\"\n \"Sure. But I didn\u0027t want to bring it up.\"\n \"Because you wanted to talk to Cal and Gage first.\"\n \"Partly, because I\u0027ve always talked to Cal and Gage first. A thirty-year habit doesn\u0027t change overnight.\" The first hint of annoyance danced around the edges of his voice. \"And mostly because I wasn\u0027t thinking about anything but you. I didn\u0027t want to think about anything but you. And I\u0027m damn well entitled to take time for that. I didn\u0027t consider my idea about Giles Dent as foreplay, and I sure as hell didn\u0027t consider talk about human sacrifice as postcoital conversation. Hang me.\"\n \"You should\u0027ve... Human sacrifice? What are you talking about? What do you mean?\"\n The phone rang, and cursing, Layla reached across his desk to answer. \"Good afternoon, Fox B. O\u0027Dell\u0027s office. I\u0027m sorry, Mr. O\u0027Dell\u0027s with a client. May I take a message?\" She scribbled a name and number on Fox\u0027s memo pad. \"Yes, of course, I\u0027ll see he gets it. Thank you.\"\n She hung up. \"You can call them back when we\u0027re done here. I need to know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n \"A possibility. Ann wrote that Dent intended to do something no guardian had done, and that there\u0027d be a price. The guardians are the good guys, right? That\u0027s how we\u0027ve always looked at them, at Dent. The white hats. But even white hats can step into the gray. Or past the gray. I see it all the time in my line of work. What people do if they\u0027re desperate enough, if they feel justified, if they stop believing they have another choice. Blood sacrifice. That\u0027s the province of the other side. Usually.\"\n \"The deer, the one Quinn saw in her dream last winter, lying across the path in the woods with its throat slit. The blood of the innocent. It\u0027s in the notes. We speculated that Dent did that, that he sacrificed the fawn. But you said human.\"\n \"Do you think that sacrificing Bambi could have given Dent the power he needed to hold Twisse for three hundred years? The power to pass what he did to me, Cal, and Gage when the time came? That\u0027s what I asked myself, Layla. And I don\u0027t think it could\u0027ve been enough.\"\n He paused, because even now it left him slightly ill to consider it. \"He told Hester to run. On the night of July seventh, sixteen fifty-two, after she\u0027d condemned him as a witch, he told her to run. That came from you.\"\n \"Yes, he told her to run.\"\n \"He knew what was about to happen. Not just that he\u0027d pull Twisse into some other dimension for a few centuries, but what it would cost to do it.\"\n She put a fist to her heart, rubbed it there as she stared at Fox. \"The people who were at the Pagan Stone.\"\n \"About a dozen of them, as far as we can tell. That\u0027s a lot of blood. That\u0027s a major sacrifice.\"\n \"You think he used them.\" Slowly, carefully, she lowered to a chair. \"You think he killed them. Not Twisse, but Dent.\"\n \"I think he let them die, which being a lawyer I could argue isn\u0027t the same by law. Depraved indifference we could call it, except for the little matter of intent. He used their deaths.\" Fox\u0027s voice was heavy on the words. \"I think he used the fire-the torches they carried, and the fire he made, to engulf them, to scorch the ground, to draw from that act-one no guardian had ever committed, the power to do what he\u0027d decided had to be done.\"\n The color died out of her face, leaving her eyes eerily green. \"If it\u0027s true, what does that make him? What does that make any of us?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Damned maybe, if you subscribe to damnation. I\u0027ve been a subscriber for nearly twenty-one years now.\"\n \"We thought, we assumed, it was Twisse who caused the deaths of all those people that night.\"\n \"Maybe it was. In part, even if my idea\u0027s crap, it was. How many of them would have gone to the Pagan Stone, looking to kill Giles Dent and Ann Hawkins if they hadn\u0027t been under Twisse\u0027s influence? But if we tip that to the side, and we look at the grays, isn\u0027t it possible Dent used Twisse? He knew what was coming, according to the journals, he knew. He sent Ann away to protect her and his sons. He gave his life-white hat time. But if he took the others, that put a lot of bloodstains on the white.\"\n \"It makes horrible sense. It makes sickening sense.\"\n \"We need to look at it, and maybe when we do, we\u0027ll know better what has to be done.\" He studied her face, the shock that covered it. \"Pack it in, go on home.\"\n \"It\u0027s barely two. I have work.\"\n \"I can handle the phones for the next couple of hours. Take a walk, get some air. Take a nap, a bubble bath, whatever.\"\n Bracing a hand on the arm of the chair, she got slowly to her feet. \"Is that what you think of me? That I crumble at the first ugly slap? That I can\u0027t or won\u0027t stand up to it? It took me a while to get my feet when I came to the Hollow-hang me-but I\u0027ve got them now. I don\u0027t need a goddamn bubble bath to soothe my sensibilities.\"\n \"My mistake.\"\n \"Don\u0027t underestimate me, Fox. However diluted, I have that bastard\u0027s blood in me. It could be, in the long run, I can handle the dark better than you.\"\n \"Maybe. But don\u0027t expect me to want that for you, or you overestimate me. Now you might have a better idea why I didn\u0027t bring this up yesterday, or you might just want to stay pissed about it.\"\n She closed her eyes and steadied herself. \"No, I don\u0027t want to be mad about it, and yes, I have a better idea.\" She also had a much better idea what Quinn had meant by her warning. Working, sleeping with, fighting beside. It was a lot to ask of a relationship.\n \"It\u0027s hard to separate the different things we are to each other,\" she said carefully. \"And when the lines get blurred, it\u0027s harder yet. You said, when I came in, you were feeling overwhelmed. You overwhelm me, Fox, on a lot of levels. So I keep losing my balance.\"\n \"I haven\u0027t had mine since I met you. I\u0027ll try to catch you when you stumble if you do the same for me.\"\n And didn\u0027t that say it all. She glanced at her watch. \"Oh, look at that. I nearly missed my afternoon break. Only a couple minutes left. Well, I\u0027d better put them to good use.\"\n She walked around the desk, leaned down. \"You\u0027re on break, too, by the way, so this office is closed for the next thirty seconds.\" She laid her lips on his, brushing her fingertips over his face, back into his hair.\n And there, she thought, as strange as it was, she found her balance again.\n Straightening, she took his hand between both of hers for the last few seconds, then letting it go, stepped back. \"Mrs. Mullendore would like to speak with you. Her number\u0027s on your desk.\"\n \"Layla,\" he said when she reached the doorway. \"I\u0027m going to have to give you longer breaks.\"\n She smiled over her shoulder as she continued out. Alone, Fox sat quietly at his desk another moment, and thought of what a good man, even the best of men might do if all he loved was threatened.\n WHEN THE SIX OF THEM WERE TOGETHER THAT evening in the sparsely furnished living room of the rental house, Fox read the passages from Ann\u0027s journal that had flicked the switch for him. He laid out his theory, as he had for Layla.\n \"Jesus, Fox. Guardian.\" Cal\u0027s resistance to the idea was palpable. \"It means he protected. He\u0027d dedicated his life to that purpose, and all the lives he remembered before the last. I\u0027ve felt some of what he felt, I\u0027ve seen some of what he saw.\"\n \"But not all.\" Gage paced in front of the window as he often did during discussions. \"Bits and pieces, Cal, and that\u0027s it. If it went down this way, I\u0027d say that these particular bits and pieces would be ones Dent would do his best to keep hidden, for as long as he could.\"\n \"Then why let Hester go?\" Cal demanded. \"Wasn\u0027t she both the most innocent there, and the most dangerous to him?\"\n \"Because we had to be.\" Cybil looked at Quinn, at Layla. \"We three had to become, and Hester\u0027s child had to survive for that to happen. It\u0027s a matter of power. The guardian, lifetime after lifetime, played by the rules-as far as we know-and could never win. He could never completely stop his foe.\"\n \"And becoming more human,\" Layla added. \"I was thinking that through today. Every generation, wouldn\u0027t he have become more human, with all the frailties? But Twisse remained as ever. How much longer could Dent have fought? How many more lifetimes did he have?\"\n \"So he made a choice.\" Fox nodded. \"And used the kind of weaponry Twisse had always used.\"\n \"And killed innocent people so he could buy time? So he could wait for us?\"\n \"It\u0027s horrible.\" Quinn reached for Cal\u0027s hand. \"It\u0027s horrible to think about it, to consider it. But I guess we have to.\"\n \"So if we go with this, you\u0027re descendents of a demon, and we\u0027re descendents of a mass murderer.\" Cal shook his head. \"That\u0027s a hell of a mix.\"\n \"We are what we make ourselves.\" There was a whiff of heat in Cybil\u0027s words. \"We use what we have and we decide what we are. Was what he did right, was it justified? I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m not going to judge him.\"\n Gage turned from the window. \"And what do we have?\"\n \"We have words on a page, a stone broken in three equal parts, a place of power in the woods.

But a night of pre-pubescent celebration turns into a night of horror as their blood brother oath unleashes a three-hundred year curse. \n Twenty-one years later, Fox O\u0027Dell and his friends have seen their town plagued by a week of unexplainable evil events two more times - every seven years. With the clock winding down on the third set of seven years, someone else has taken an interest in the town\u0027s folklore. \n A boutique manager from New York, Layla Darnell was drawn to Hawkins Hollow for reasons she can\u0027t explain - but the recent attacks on her life make it clear that it is personal. And though Fox tries to keep his professional distance, his interests in Layla have become personal too.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-hollow-sign-of-seven-2.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-hollow-sign-of-seven-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:45 PM"}}
