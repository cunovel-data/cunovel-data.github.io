{"id":85813,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"SHE WAS WET AND COLD, SO FOX CARRIED LAYLA to the bed, wrapped the blanket around her. A bruising scrape marred her temple, and would undoubtedly ache when she came to. No blood, no breaks as far as he could see on a quick and cursory look. Getting her warm and dry were priorities, he thought. Then he\u0027d make certain, then he\u0027d look closer, look deeper. He\u0027d barely had time to check her pulse before Quinn and Cal rushed in.\n \"Is Layla- Oh, God.\"\n \"Fainted, I think. I think she just fainted,\" Fox told Quinn when she dropped down beside him. \"Maybe hit her head. Something happened when she was in the shower. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything there now, but Cal-\"\n \"I\u0027ll check.\"\n \"You said... Sorry.\" Quinn mopped at her own tears. \"Really bad day. You said you heard her screaming.\"\n \"Yeah, I heard her.\" Her terror had been so huge, he thought as he pushed her wet hair away from her face. It had reached out and gripped him by the throat, had filled his head with her screams. \"I heard all of you.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I guess our Bat Signal worked. It was jumbled, but I heard all of you. She needs a towel. Her hair\u0027s wet.\"\n \"Here.\" Cal handed him one. \"Bathroom\u0027s clear.\"\n \"Cybil, Gage?\"\n Cal squeezed the hand Quinn held out to him. \"I\u0027ll go check on them. Stay here.\"\n \"What happened to you?\"\n Fox shook his head. \"Later.\" He lifted Layla\u0027s head to spread the towel under her hair. \"She\u0027s coming around. Layla.\" Relief gushed through him when her eyelids fluttered. \"Come on back, Layla. It\u0027s all right. It\u0027s over.\"\n She surfaced with a wheezing gasp, with her hands slapping wildly, her eyes wide with horror.\n \"Stop. Stop.\" He did all he could think to do. He wrapped himself around her, pushed calm into her mind. \"It\u0027s over. I\u0027ve got you.\"\n \"In the shower.\"\n \"Gone. They\u0027re gone.\" But he could see in her mind how they\u0027d come out of the drain, slid across the tiles.\n \"I couldn\u0027t get out. The door wouldn\u0027t open. They were everywhere, they were all over me.\" Shuddering, shuddering, she burrowed against him. \"They\u0027re gone? You\u0027re sure?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure. Are you hurt? Let me see.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think... My head a little. And-\" She focused on him. \"Your face! Oh God, your hand. It\u0027s swollen.\"\n \"It\u0027s healing. It\u0027s okay.\" And the healing pain was nothing against the overwhelming relief. \"It looks like Twisse took a shot at all of us at once.\"\n Quinn nodded. \"He hit me and Cal. Grand slam.\"\n \"More a clean sweep,\" Cybil said from the doorway. \"He hit me and Gage, too. Six for six. Fox, why don\u0027t you go on downstairs? Your pals are still pretty shaken. We\u0027ll help Layla get dressed, then we\u0027ll be down in a few.\"\n She was ice pale, he noted. It was the first time he\u0027d seen Cybil that far off her stride in the months he\u0027d known her. Quinn was already rising, going to her. Because the room became essentially and completely female again, Fox decided it was probably best for each sector to retreat to its particular corner, take a deep breath before mixing again.\n \"All right.\" But he touched Layla\u0027s face, kissed her gently. \"I\u0027ll be right downstairs.\"\n TIMES LIKE THESE, FOX THOUGHT, CALLED FOR whiskey. He found the single, unopened bottle of Jameson among the wine, and figured it had been Cal\u0027s contribution to the liquor supply. He got glasses, ice, and poured a generous two fingers in each.\n \"Good thinking.\" Cal downed half of his in one swallow, and still his eyes remained haunted. \"You healed up. You looked bad when I saw you outside.\"\n \"Spiders. Lots of them. Big bastards.\"\n \"Where?\"\n \"My office.\"\n \"The town was gone for me.\" Cal studied the whiskey, swirled it. \"I came out of the center with Lump, and it was gone. Like a bomb had gone off. Buildings leveled, fire and smoke. Bodies. Jesus, pieces of them everywhere.\" He took another, slower sip. \"We\u0027ll need to write this down, get everybody\u0027s deal.\"\n \"Oh yeah, that\u0027ll help.\" Gage downed a single, bitter swallow. \"It got us, big-time. Now we\u0027re going to take minutes of the meeting.\"\n \"You got better?\" Cal shot back. \"You got the final solution, bro? Because if you do, don\u0027t hold back.\"\n \"I know we\u0027re not going to talk it to death. And sitting around taking notes doesn\u0027t mean dick unless you\u0027re writing a book. That\u0027s your lady\u0027s business, not mine.\"\n \"So what are you going to do? Take a walk? You\u0027re good at that. Are you just going to catch a plane to wherever the hell and come back for the finale? Or do you want to just skip that part this year?\"\n \"I come back to this hellhole because I swore on it.\" Rage whirling around him like wind, Gage moved in on Cal. \"If I hadn\u0027t, it could blow to hell as far as I\u0027m concerned. It doesn\u0027t mean a damn to me.\"\n \"Not much does.\"\n \"Stop!\" Fox\u0027s voice snapped out as he wedged between them. \"It doesn\u0027t do any good to start swiping at each other.\"\n \"Maybe we should make peace signs and daisy chains.\"\n \"Look, Gage. If you want out, there\u0027s the goddamn door. And if all you can do is kick him while he\u0027s down,\" Fox added, swinging around to Cal, \"don\u0027t let the same goddamn door hit you on the ass on your way out.\"\n \"I\u0027m not kicking anyone, and who the hell asked you?\"\n Raised voices had Cybil quickening her steps. She took stock of the scene in the kitchen quickly, and stepped into it before someone threw a punch. \"Well, this is productive.\"\n She walked right in the middle of three furious men, snatched the glass out of Gage\u0027s hand, drank. And her voice held the faintest edge of boredom. \"At least someone had the good sense to get out the whiskey before the testosterone attack. If you boys want to fight, go outside and beat on each other. You\u0027ll heal quickly enough, but the furniture in here won\u0027t.\"\n Fox settled down first. He set the whiskey he no longer wanted aside, gave a sheepish shrug. \"They started it.\"\n Appreciating him, Cybil cocked a brow. \"And do you do everything they do? Jump off bridges, play with matches? Let\u0027s try this instead. I\u0027m going to put food and drink together to address that basic human need. The comfort it brings should help us get through telling each other what happened.\"\n \"Gage doesn\u0027t want to talk,\" Cal said.\n \"Neither do I.\" She looked at Gage as she spoke. \"But I\u0027m going to. It\u0027s another basic human need, and shows us we\u0027ve got that all over the Big Evil Bastard.\" Smiling with lips she\u0027d painted a defiant coral before coming down, she shook back her hair. \"Why doesn\u0027t somebody order pizza?\"\n IT LACKED EFFICIENCY, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING more comforting about gathering in the living room rather than sitting at the dining room table like sensible adults. Cybil set out a platter of antipasto while they waited for pizza.\n Fox sat on the floor at Layla\u0027s feet. \"Ladies first,\" he suggested. \"Quinn?\"\n \"I went out for ice cream, and since I was going to eat ice cream, I went for the power walk first.\" Her fingers twisted the chunky silver chain around her neck. \"But I kept ending up in the same place, on the same corner. It didn\u0027t matter which direction I took. I couldn\u0027t find my way, couldn\u0027t get home.\" She gripped Cal\u0027s hand, pressed her forehead to his shoulder. \"I couldn\u0027t find you. It went pitch dark. There was no one, and I couldn\u0027t get back.\"\n \"Everything was gone for me.\" Sliding an arm around her shoulders, Cal gathered her close. \"The town was destroyed, everyone dead, blown to pieces. I ran here, but there was nothing. Just a smoking hole in the ground. I don\u0027t know where I was going. Looking for you. Because I couldn\u0027t, I wouldn\u0027t believe... Then I saw you, and Fox.\"\n \"I saw you first,\" Quinn said to Fox. \"It was like you came through a wall of water. You were blurred at first, and your footsteps-you were running-but the sound was smothered. Then it all cleared. You grabbed my hand, and it all cleared.\n \"That has to mean something, don\u0027t you think?\" She glanced around as she asked. \"I was heading for hysterical. I think I\u0027d been there and back at least once already, and was making the return trip. Then I saw Fox, and when he took my hand everything went back the way it\u0027s meant to be. Then Cal was coming.\"\n \"You weren\u0027t there, either of you. Nothing was. Then you were.\" Cal shook his head. \"It was almost like switching a channel. Like a click. You were bleeding,\" he said to Fox.\n \"Spiders,\" Fox said and told them. \"I didn\u0027t notice anything off about the town when I got out. I saw you on the corner, Quinn. Looking lost, I guess. I\u0027d heard you- sensed you, and the others. Like a bad connection, fuzzy and weak. But I could hear Layla screaming. I heard that loud and clear.\"\n \"You were two blocks away,\" Quinn pointed out.\n \"I could hear her screaming,\" he repeated. \"Right up until I got into the house. Then it stopped. It must\u0027ve been when you passed out.\"\n \"It was after Quinn went out. She went for ice cream because I was upset.\" Her gaze flicked to Fox, then back to the fingers linked in her lap. \"I decided to take a shower while she was gone. I felt it first, sliding over my foot. They were coming out of the drain. Snakes. With the screams I let out, I\u0027m surprised they didn\u0027t hear me in the next county.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t hear you,\" Cybil told her. \"I was right downstairs and I didn\u0027t hear a thing.\"\n \"They kept coming.\" When her breath wanted to snag, Layla eased it out slowly, deliberately. \"I got out of the shower, but they were on the floor, too. Coming up out of the sink. Not real, that\u0027s what I kept trying to tell myself, but I couldn\u0027t-I didn\u0027t keep my head. When the door wouldn\u0027t open, I went a little crazy, beating at them with a towel, with my hands. The window was too small, and it wouldn\u0027t open anyway. I must\u0027ve fainted, because I don\u0027t remember anything else until Fox was there. I was in bed, and Fox and Quinn were there.\"\n \"Your passing out might be part of the reason it stopped,\" Cybil speculated. \"There\u0027s no maintaining an illusion when you\u0027re unconscious.\"\n \"What happened to you?\" Layla asked her.\n \"I couldn\u0027t see. Gage and I were in the kitchen, and my eyes stung for a minute, then went blurry. Then everything went gray. I went blind.\"\n \"Oh, Cyb.\"\n She smiled at Quinn. \"Q knows that\u0027s a small, personal terror of mine. My father lost his sight in an accident. He was never able to adjust, accept. Two years later he killed himself. So blindness holds a particular terror for me. You were there,\" she said to Gage, \"then you weren\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t hear you, and I asked you to help me, but you didn\u0027t. I guess you couldn\u0027t.\"\n She paused, but he said nothing. \"I heard the front door slam open. I heard Fox. My vision started to clear, and then... you were there again.\" He\u0027d held her, she thought. They\u0027d held each other. \"Where did you go, Gage? We need to know what happened to each one of us.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t go far. Back to the apartment where I used to live. Above the bowling alley.\"\n At the knock on the door, Cal rose, but he kept his eyes on Gage\u0027s face. \"I\u0027ll get that.\"\n \"There was a physical thing with you,\" Gage went on. \"With your eyes. The irises, the pupils were covered, the whole of your eyes were white. And no, I couldn\u0027t help. I stepped toward you, and right into the apartment.\"\n Cal came back, set the pizza boxes on the table. \"Were you alone?\"\n \"At first. I couldn\u0027t get the door open, the windows. That seems to be a recurring theme.\"\n \"Trapped,\" Layla murmured. \"Everyone\u0027s afraid of being trapped, being locked in.\"\n \"I heard him coming. I knew-I know the sound of his feet on the stairs, when he\u0027s drunk, when he\u0027s not. He was, and he was coming. Then I was back in the kitchen.\"\n \"There\u0027s more. Why are you holding back?\" Cybil demanded. \"We all went through something.\"\n \"When I reached for the doorknob, it wasn\u0027t my hand. Not this hand.\" Gage held his up, turned it, studied it. \"I saw myself in the mirror. I was about seven, maybe eight. Before that night at the Pagan Stone, younger than that. Before things changed. Before we changed. And he was drunk, and he was coming. Clear enough?\"\n In the silence, Quinn reached down for her tape recorder, ejected the tape, put in a fresh one. \"This hasn\u0027t happened before, am I right on that? That all of you were affected at the same time, that so many were affected?\"\n \"Dreams,\" Cal said. \"The three of us have dreams, usually on the same night, not always about the same thing. That can happen weeks, even months before the Seven. But something like this, no. Not outside of those seven days.\"\n \"It went to a lot of trouble to get to us,\" Fox commented, \"to cherry-pick our particular and specific fears.\"\n \"Why were you the only one who was hurt?\" Layla demanded. \"I felt them bite me, but I didn\u0027t have any bites when I came out of it. But you did. They\u0027re healed now, but you did.\"\n \"Maybe I let it in too far, and my own ability worked against me. Made my fear more real, more tangible. I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"It\u0027s possible.\" Quinn considered. \"Could it have started with you? Given the timing, it could have started with you first. Used more, well, juice. Fed off that for the rest. Not just your fear, but your pain, too. It used the connections. You to Cal or me-one of us was probably next. Then Layla, then Cybil, and rounding it up with Gage.\"\n \"Like a current. The energy.\" Layla nodded. \"Moving from one to the other. Fox weakened the current when he broke free. And back down the line. If that\u0027s the way it happened, it could be a kind of defense, couldn\u0027t it? Something we could use.\"\n \"Our energy against its energy.\" Quinn gave in and flipped open the pizza box. \"Positive against negative.\"\n \"I think we\u0027ll need to do more than think of raindrops on roses.\" Cybil slid a slice out for herself. \"And whiskers on kittens.\"\n \"While I doubt we\u0027re going to hear the guys do a chorus of \u0027Do-Re-Mi,\u0027 even if lives depend on it, roses and kittens are a springboard.\" Considering big trauma, Quinn treated herself to an entire slice. \"If each of us has personal fears, don\u0027t we all have personal joys? Yes, yes, hokey, but not really over the top. Oh God, this is good. See, personal joy. Pepperoni pizza.\"\n \"That\u0027s not how Fox broke its hold,\" Layla pointed out. \"I don\u0027t think he mentioned focusing on pizza or rainbows.\"\n \"Not entirely true.\" Because Lump\u0027s eyes filled with love, Fox peeled a piece of pepperoni off his slice, fed it to the dog. \"I thought about how what was happening was bullshit. Not easy when hungry mutant spiders are crawling all over you.\"\n \"Eating here,\" Cal reminded him.\n \"But I thought more about how we were going to kick the Big Evil Bastard\u0027s ass. How we were going to end him. I kept thinking that, like I was telling him. Trash talking, lots of very foul language. That\u0027s a personal pleasure, on a very real level. And when those things started falling off me, thumping on the ground, I started feeling fairly perky. Not, the hills are alive, spinning around like a lunatic perky. But not half bad, considering.\"\n \"It\u0027s always worked that way for you. Once you figured it out,\" Cal added. \"And it\u0027s worked for me, for Gage. We\u0027ve been able to break down the illusions-when they are illusions. But I tried, and I couldn\u0027t this time.\"\n \"So you bought it.\"\n \"I-\"\n \"You bought it, at least for a few minutes. Because it was too much, Cal. Everything that matters to you gone. Quinn, your family, us, the town. And just you left. You didn\u0027t stop it, so everyone and everything was gone, killed, destroyed. But you. It was too damn much,\" Fox repeated. \"Those spiders weren\u0027t real, not all the way real. But I saw my hand after they had at me, and it was swollen to the size of a cantaloupe, and bleeding. The wounds were real, so I\u0027m saying Twisse put a hell of a lot into this one.\"\n \"It\u0027s been over a week since the last incident. Also starting with you, Fox.\" Cybil laid a slice on a plate, walked it over to Gage. \"It used Block\u0027s jealousy, his anger, maybe his guilt, fed off that, used that to infect him enough to have him attack you.\"\n \"So where did it get the extra amps for this?\" Gage shrugged. \"If that\u0027s the question, there are plenty of negative emotions running around this town, just like any place else.\"\n \"It\u0027s specific,\" Cal disagreed. \"It was specific to Block. This was specific to us.\"\n Cybil slid a glance toward Layla, but said nothing as she took her seat again.\n \"I was upset, and angry. So were you,\" Layla said to Fox. \"We had... a disagreement.\"\n \"If it can cook up something like that every time one of us gets pissed off, we\u0027re toast,\" Gage decided.\n \"They were both upset.\" Quinn considered how best to phrase it. \"With each other. That could factor. And it may be that when the emotions involved are particularly intense, when there\u0027s sexuality involved, it\u0027s more potent.\"\n Gage lifted his beer. \"Again. Toast.\"\n \"I happen to think intense human emotion, emotion that draws from a well of affection,\" Cybil added, \"and good healthy sex, is a hell of a lot more potent than anything the son of a bitch can throw at us. That\u0027s not spinning in circles on a mountaintop naivete. It comes from studying human relationships and their power, and this particular situation specifically-and how it\u0027s come to us. How many times have the three of you had a scene like you did before in the kitchen?\"\n \"What scene?\" Quinn wanted to know.\n \"It was nothing,\" Cal muttered.\n \"You were in each other\u0027s faces, shouting obscenities, and about to come to blows. It was...\" Cybil\u0027s smile was sly and just a little feline. \"Stimulating. Countless times, I wager-want to take the bet?\" she asked Gage. \"Countless times, and I up my bet to wager several of them have resulted in fists in faces. But here you are. Here you are because at the core, you love each other. That\u0027s the base, and nothing changes it. It can\u0027t shake that base. It must beat its fists-if fists it has-at the barrier it can\u0027t pass. We\u0027re going to need that base, and we\u0027re going to need all those intense human emotions, especially if we\u0027re going to do the incredibly foolish and attempt a blood ritual.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got something,\" Quinn stated.\n \"I think I do. I want to wait to hear back from a couple more sources. But yeah, I think I do.\"\n \"Spill!\"\n \"For one thing, it means all six of us, and we\u0027ll have to go back to the source.\"\n \"The Pagan Stone,\" Fox said.\n \"Where else?\"\n LATER, CAL GRABBED A MOMENT ALONE WITH Quinn. He drew her into her bedroom, and with his arms around her, just breathed her in. \"It was worse,\" he said quietly, \"worse than it\u0027s ever been because for a while I thought I might have lost you.\"\n \"It was worse, because I couldn\u0027t find you.\" She tipped her head back, sank into the kiss with him. \"It\u0027s harder when you love someone. It\u0027s better and it\u0027s harder, and it\u0027s pretty much everything.\"\n \"I want to ask you a favor. I want you to go away, just for a few days,\" he continued, talking fast. \"A week, maybe two. I know you\u0027ve got other writing projects you\u0027re squeezing in. Take a break, maybe go back home to-\"\n \"This is my home now.\"\n \"You know what I mean, Quinn.\"\n \"Sure. And no problem.\" Her smile was sunny as June. \"As long as you come with me. We\u0027ll have ourselves a little holiday. How\u0027s that?\"\n \"I\u0027m serious.\"\n \"So am I. I\u0027ll go if you go. Otherwise, you\u0027re going to want to drop this. Don\u0027t even think about picking a fight,\" she warned him. \"I can practically see you trying it out in your head, calculating if you got me mad enough I\u0027d walk. You can\u0027t. I won\u0027t.\" For emphasis, she put her hands on his cheeks, squeezed. \"You\u0027re scared for me. So am I, just like I\u0027m scared for you. It\u0027s all part of the package now.\"\n \"You could go buy a wedding dress.\"\n \"Now that\u0027s fighting dirty.\" But she laughed, kissed him hard. \"I\u0027ve already got some lines on that, thank you very much. Your mother and mine are bonding like Super Glue and... more Super Glue over wedding plans. Everything\u0027s under control. We had a bad day, Cal, but we came through it.\"\n He drew her back, breathed her in once more. \"I need to take a walk around town. I need to... I need to see it.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"I need to take a walk with Gage and Fox.\"\n \"I get it. Go on. Just come back to me.\"\n \"Every day,\" he told her.\n WHEN HE GOT THEM OUTSIDE, CAL WALKED THE neighborhood first. The light was soft, easing in on evening. There were the houses he knew, the yards, the sidewalks. He walked by his great-grandmother\u0027s house, where his cousin\u0027s car sat in the drive, and flowers budded and bloomed along the walk.\n There was the house of the girl he\u0027d been crazy about when he\u0027d been sixteen. Where was she now? Columbus? Cleveland? He couldn\u0027t quite remember where she\u0027d gone, only that she\u0027d moved away with her family in the fall of the year he\u0027d turned seventeen.\n After that Seven, when her father had tried to hang himself from the black walnut tree in their backyard. Cal remembered cutting the man down himself, and having no time for more, tying him to the tree with the hanging rope to hold him until the rage passed.\n \"You never did score with Melissa Eggart, did you, hot-shot?\"\n How like Gage to remember and to turn the memory into something normal. \"I doubled. Was working my way up to stealing third. Then things got busy.\"\n \"Yeah.\" Gage slid his hands into his pockets. \"Things got busy.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry about before. And you were right,\" he added to Fox. \"It\u0027s stupid to swipe at each other.\"\n \"Forget it,\" Gage told him. \"I\u0027ve thought about walking plenty of times.\"\n \"Thinking and doing got miles between them.\" They turned, headed toward Main. \"I wanted to punch something, and you were handy.\"\n \"O\u0027Dell\u0027s handier, and he\u0027s used to getting punched.\" When there was no sarcastic rejoinder from Fox, Gage eyed him. He thought of the ways he could handle Fox\u0027s mood, and opted for what he did best. Needling him. \"Are you having intense human emotions?\"\n \"Oh, suck off.\"\n \"There he is.\" Gage swung an arm over Fox\u0027s shoulders.\n \"Punching you still isn\u0027t out of the question.\"\n \"If she was pissed at you,\" Cal said helpfully, \"she\u0027s not now. Not after your white-charger routine.\"\n \"It\u0027s not about that. About being pissed, about saving the girl. It\u0027s about wanting and needing different things. Look, I\u0027m heading home from here. I didn\u0027t shut anything down, lock anything up.\"\n \"We\u0027ll go with you, check it out.\"\n \"No, I got it. I\u0027ve got some actual work to do. If anything else needs going over tonight, I\u0027ll crib off your notes. See you later.\"\n \"He\u0027s got it bad,\" Gage commented as they watched Fox head down Main. \"Real bad.\"\n \"Maybe we should go with him anyway.\"\n \"No. We\u0027re not what he wants right now.\"\n They turned, walking the opposite way as night crept closer. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hollow-sign-of-seven-2/page-18.html","bookId":2249,"book":{"id":2249,"title":"The Hollow (Sign of Seven #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Hollow (Sign of Seven #2) \n In the small village of Hawkins Hollow, three best friends who share the same birthday sneak off into the woods for a sleepover the evening before turning 10.
