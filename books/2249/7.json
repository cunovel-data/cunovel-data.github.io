{"id":85802,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"IT WAS FULL DARK BY THE TIME FOX PULLED UP behind his father\u0027s truck. The lateness of the hour had been one of the reasons his parents weren\u0027t going to be invaded by six people on a kind of scavenger hunt.\\n\\n They\u0027d have handled it, he knew. The house had always been open to anyone, anytime. Relatives, old friends, new friends, the occasional stranger could count on a bed, a meal, a refuge at the Barry-O\u0027Dells. Payment for the hospitality might be feeding chickens, milking goats, weeding a garden, splitting wood.\\n\\n Throughout his childhood the house had been noisy, busy, and often still was. It was a house where those who lived in it were encouraged to pursue and explore their own paths, where the rules were flexible and individualized, and where everyone had been expected to contribute to the whole.\\n\\n It was still home, he thought, the rambling house of stone and wood with its wide front porch, its interesting juts and painted shutters (currently a sassy red). He supposed even if he ever got the chance to make his own, to build his own family, this farm, this house, this place would always be home.\\n\\n There was music when he stepped into the big living room with its eccentric mix of art, its bold use of color and texture. Every piece of furniture was handcrafted, most by his father. Lamps, paintings, vases, bowls, throws, pillows, candles, all original work-family or friends.\\n\\n Had he appreciated that as a child? he wondered. Probably not. It was just home.\\n\\n A pair of dogs rushed from the rear of the house to greet him with welcoming barks and swinging tails. There\u0027d always been dogs here. These, Mick and Dylan, were mutts-as they always were-rescued from the pound. Fox crouched to give them both a rub when his father followed them out.\\n\\n \"Hey.\" Brian\u0027s grin flashed, that instant sign of pleasure. \"How\u0027s it going? You eat?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Come on back. We\u0027re still at it, and there\u0027s a rumor about apple cobbler.\" Brian swung an arm over Fox\u0027s shoulders as they walked back to the kitchen.\\n\\n \"I was going to drop by today while I was working in town,\" Brian continued, \"but I got hung up. Look what I found,\" he said to Jo. \"He must\u0027ve heard about the cobbler.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all over town.\" Fox went around the big butcher-block table to kiss his mother. The kitchen smelled of his mother\u0027s herbs and candles, and the thick soup from the pot on the stove. \"And before you ask, I\u0027ve had dinner.\"\\n\\n He sat in a chair he helped make when he\u0027d been thirteen. \"I came by to talk to you guys about the house-the farm.\"\\n\\n \"Moving back in?\" Brian asked and picked up his spoon to dig back into what Fox recognized as his mother\u0027s lentil and brown rice soup.\\n\\n \"No.\" Though that door would always be open, he knew. \"The main part of the house is pre-Civil War, right?\"\\n\\n \"Eighteen fifties,\" Jo confirmed. \"You know that.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but I wondered if you knew if it was built on any earlier structure.\"\\n\\n \"Possible,\" his father answered. \"The stone shed out back\u0027s earlier. It stands to reason there was more here at one time.\"\\n\\n \"Right. You looked into the history. I remember.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\" Jo studied his face. \"There were people farming here before the white man came over to run them out.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not talking about the indigenous, or their exploitation by invaders.\" He did not want to get her started on that one. \"I\u0027m more interested in what you might know about after the settlers came here.\"\\n\\n \"When the Hollow was settled,\" Jo said. \"When Lazarus Twisse arrived.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"I know the land was farmed then, that the area was known as Hollow Creek. I have some paperwork on it. Why, Fox? We\u0027re not close to the Pagan Stone, we\u0027re outside of town.\"\\n\\n \"We think Ann Hawkins might have stayed here, had her sons here.\"\\n\\n \"On this farm?\" Brian mused. \"How about that?\"\\n\\n \"She wrote journals, I told you about that, and how there are gaps in them. We haven\u0027t found any from the time she left-or supposedly left-the Hollow until she came back a couple years later. If we could find them...\"\\n\\n \"That was three hundred years ago,\" Jo pointed out.\\n\\n \"I know, but we have to try. If we could come by in the morning, first thing in the morning before I have any clients coming in-\"\\n\\n \"You know you don\u0027t have to ask,\" Brian said. \"We\u0027ll be here.\"\\n\\n Jo said nothing for a moment. \"I\u0027ll get the famous cobbler.\" She rose, stroking a hand over her son\u0027s shoulder on her way to the cupboard.\\n\\n HE\u0027D WANTED TO KEEP ALL OF IT AWAY FROM HIS family, away from home. When he drove the familiar roads back to the farm at the first break of dawn, Fox told himself this search didn\u0027t, wouldn\u0027t, pull his family in any further. Even if they proved Ann had stayed there on their land, even if they found her journals, it didn\u0027t change the fact the farm was one of the safe zones.\\n\\n None of their families had ever been infected, none of them had ever been threatened. That wasn\u0027t going to change. He simply wouldn\u0027t allow it to change. The threat was coming sooner, and harder, that was fact. But his family remained safe.\\n\\n He pulled in front of the farmhouse just ahead of Cal and Gage.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got two hours,\" he told them as they got out. \"If we need more, I can try to shuffle some stuff. Otherwise, it has to wait until tomorrow. Saturday\u0027s clear.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll work it out.\" Cal stepped aside so that Lump and the two host dogs could sniff each other and get reacquainted.\\n\\n \"Here comes the estrogen.\" Gage lifted his chin toward the road. \"Is your lady ready to ante up, Hawkins?\"\\n\\n \"She said she is, so she is.\" But Cal walked to the car, drew Quinn aside when the women piled out. \"I don\u0027t know if I can help you with this.\"\\n\\n \"Cal-\"\\n\\n \"I know we went over this last night, but I\u0027m allowed to be obsessive about the woman I love.\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely.\" She linked her hands around his neck so that her bright blue eyes smiled into his. \"Obsess me.\"\\n\\n He took the offered mouth, let himself sink in. \"I\u0027ll do what I can, you know that. But the fact is, I\u0027ve been coming here all my life, slept in this house, ate in it, played in it, ran the fields, helped with chores. It was my second home, and I never got a single flash of the past, of Ann, of anything.\"\\n\\n \"Giles Dent wasn\u0027t here, neither were the ones-the guardians that came before him. Not so far as we know. If Ann came here to stay, she came here without him, and stayed on after Dent was already gone. This one\u0027s on me, Cal.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" He touched her lips with his again. \"Just take it easy on yourself, Blondie.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a wonderful house,\" Layla said to Fox. \"Just a wonderful spot. Isn\u0027t it, Cybil?\"\\n\\n \"Like a Pissarro painting. What kind of farming, Fox?\"\\n\\n \"Organic family farming, you could say. They\u0027ll be around back this time of morning, dealing with the animals.\"\\n\\n \"Cows?\" Layla fell into step behind him.\\n\\n \"No. Goats, for the milk. Chickens, for the eggs. Bees for the honey. Vegetables, herbs, flowers. Everything gets used, and what\u0027s surplus we-they-sell or barter.\"\\n\\n The scent of animals wound through the morning air, exotic to her city-girl senses. She spotted a tire swing hanging from the thick, gnarled branch of what she thought might be a sycamore. \"It must\u0027ve been great growing up here.\"\\n\\n \"It was. I might not have thought so when I was shoveling chicken manure or hacking at bindweed, but it was great.\"\\n\\n Chickens clucked in their busy and urgent voices. As they rounded the house Fox saw his mother casting feed for them. She wore jeans, her ancient Wellingtons, a frayed plaid shirt over a thermal pullover. Her hair was down her back, a long, thick braid.\\n\\n Now it was his turn for a flash from the past. He saw her in his mind, doing the same chore on a bright summer morning, but she\u0027d worn a long blue dress, with a sling around her, and his baby sister tucked into it.\\n\\n Singing, he remembered. She so often sang while she worked. He heard her now, as he\u0027d heard her then.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll fly away, O glory, I\u0027ll fly away-in the morning.\"\\n\\n In the near paddock, his father milked one of the nannies, and sang with her.\\n\\n And Fox\u0027s love for them was almost impossible to hold. She saw him, smiled at him. \"Timed it to miss the chores, I see.\"\\n\\n \"I was always good at it.\"\\n\\n She cast the rest of the seed before setting her bucket down to come to him. She kissed him-forehead, one cheek, the other, the lips. \"Morning.\" Then turned to Cal and did exactly the same. \"Caleb. I heard you had news.\"\\n\\n \"I do. Here she is. Quinn, this is Joanne Barry, my childhood sweetheart.\"\\n\\n \"Apparently I have quite an act to follow. It\u0027s nice to meet you.\"\\n\\n \"Nice meeting you.\" She gave Quinn\u0027s arm a pat, then turned to Gage. \"Where have you been, and why haven\u0027t you come to see me?\"\\n\\n She kissed him, then wrapped her arms around him in a hard hug.\\n\\n He hugged back-that\u0027s what Cybil noted. He held on, closed his eyes and held tight. \"Missed you,\" he murmured.\\n\\n \"Then don\u0027t stay away so long.\" She eased back. \"Hello, Layla, it\u0027s good to see you again. And this must be Cybil.\"\\n\\n \"It must be. You have a very handsome farm, Ms. Barry.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks. Here comes my man.\"\\n\\n \"LaMancha goats?\" Cybil commented and had Jo giving her another, longer look.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. You don\u0027t look like a goatherd.\"\\n\\n \"I saw some a couple of years ago in Oregon. The way the tips of the ears turn up is distinctive. High butterfat content in the milk, isn\u0027t that right?\"\\n\\n \"It is. Would you like to try some?\"\\n\\n \"I have. It\u0027s excellent, and fabulous for baking.\"\\n\\n \"It certainly is. Bri, Cybil, Quinn, and Layla.\"\\n\\n \"Nice to-hey, we\u0027ve met.\" He grinned at Layla. \"Sort of. I saw you yesterday, walking down Main.\"\\n\\n \"You were replacing a door at the bookstore. I thought how comforting it was that there are people who know how to fix what\u0027s broken.\"\\n\\n \"Our specialty. Nice job with the blonde, Cal,\" he added, giving Cal a one-armed hug and a wink. \"About damn time,\" he said to Gage, and hugged him in turn. \"You guys want breakfast?\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have a lot of time,\" Fox told him. \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"No problem. I\u0027ll take the milk in, Jo.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get the eggs. Go ahead and put tea on, Bri. It\u0027s cold this morning.\" She turned back to Fox. \"Let us know if you need anything, or if we can help.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\" Fox gestured the group aside while his mother began gathering eggs into a basket. \"How do you want to start? Inside?\"\\n\\n \"We know the house wasn\u0027t here then?\" Quinn looked at Fox for confirmation.\\n\\n \"About a hundred years later, but it could have been built on another\u0027s foundation. I just don\u0027t know. That shed? Well, what\u0027s left of that shed, the one covered with vines? That was here.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too small.\" Layla studied the remaining walls. \"Would be, even for the time period for a house. If we\u0027re talking about a small family taking in a woman and her three babies, that couldn\u0027t have been big enough.\"\\n\\n \"A smokehouse maybe,\" Cybil mused. \"Or an animal shelter. But it\u0027s interesting that most of it\u0027s still here. There could be a reason for that.\"\\n\\n \"Let me try the house first.\" Quinn studied the shed, the land, the big stone house. \"Maybe walking around the house out here. I might get something. If not, we\u0027ll do a walk-through, since it\u0027s okay with Fox\u0027s parents. If nothing then... there\u0027s the land, that grove of trees, the fields, certainly the little ruin there. Fingers crossed, okay?\"\\n\\n She crossed the fingers of her left hand, held the right out for Cal. \"The clearing in the woods, that\u0027s sacred ground-magic spot. And the stone, it pushed those flashes right in. The attic in the library, that grabbed hold, too. I didn\u0027t have to do anything. I\u0027m not sure what I should do.\"\\n\\n \"Think about Ann,\" Cal told her. \"You\u0027ve seen her, you\u0027ve heard her. Think about her.\"\\n\\n Quinn pictured Ann Hawkins as she\u0027d seen her the first time, with her hair loose, carrying pails of water from the stream, her belly huge with her sons, and her face alight with love for the man who waited for her. She pictured her as she\u0027d seen her the second time, slim again, dressed demurely. Older, sadder.\\n\\n She walked over the tough winter grass, the thick gravel, over stepping stones. The air was cool and brisk on her cheeks, and was tinged with the scent of animal and earth. She held firm to Cal\u0027s hand, knowing-feeling-he gave her whatever he had so that their abilities linked as their fingers did.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just not going there. I\u0027m getting glimpses of you,\" she said to Cal with a quick laugh. \"A little guy, when you still needed your glasses. Fairly adorable. I can get zips of the three of you running around, and a younger boy, a girl. A toddler-another girl. She\u0027s so cute.\"\\n\\n \"You have to go deeper.\" Cal squeezed her hand. \"I\u0027m right with you.\"\\n\\n \"That might be the problem. I think I may be picking up on things you remember, your pictures.\" She squeezed his hand in turn, then drew hers free. \"I think I have to try it alone. Give me a little space. Okay, everybody? A little room.\"\\n\\n She turned, reached the corner of the house, then followed its line. It was so sturdy, she thought, and as Cybil had said, so handsome. The stone, the wood, the glass. There were flower beds sleeping, and in others sweet and hopeful shoots that must have been daffodils and tulips, hyacinths, and the summer lilies that would follow the spring.\\n\\n Strong old trees offered shade, so she imagined-or maybe she saw-the flowers that shied from sunlight blooming there.\\n\\n She smelled smoke, she realized. There must be wood fireplaces inside. Of course there would be. What wonderful old farmhouse didn\u0027t have fireplaces? Somewhere to curl up on a cold evening. Flames sending dancing shadow and light, and the warmth so welcome.\\n\\n She sat in a room lit by firelight and the glow of a single tallow candle. She did not weep though her heart was flooded with tears. With quill and ink, Ann wrote in her careful hand in the pages of her journal.\\n\\n Our sons are eight months old. They are beautiful, and they are healthy. I see you in them, beloved. I see you in their eyes and it both comforts and grieves me. I am well. The kindness of my cousin and her husband are beyond measure. Surely we are a burden on them, but we are never treated as such. In the weeks before, and some weeks after the birth of our sons there was little I could do to help my cousin. Yet she never complained. Even now with the boys to look after, I cannot do as much as I wish to repay her and cousin Fletcher.\\n\\n Mending I do. Honor and I made soap and candles, enough for Fletcher to barter.\\n\\n This is not what I wish to write, but I find it so hard to subscribe these words to this paper. My cousin has told me that young Hester Deale was drowned in the pool of Hawkins Wood, and leaves her infant daughter orphaned. She condemned you that night, as you had foreseen. She condemned me. We know it was not by her will she did so, as it was not by her will the motherless child was conceived.\\n\\n The beast is in the child, Giles. You told me again and again that what you would do would change the order,clean the blood. This sacrifice you made, and I and our children with you was necessary. On nights like this, when I am so alone, when I find my heart full of sorrow for a girl I knew who is lost, I fear what was done, what will be done so long from this night will not be enough. I mourn that you gave yourself for nothing, and our children will never see their father\u0027s face, or feel his kiss.\\n\\n I will pray for the strength and the courage you believedlived inside me. I will pray to find them again when the sun rises. Tonight, with the darkness so close, I can only be a woman who longs for her love.\\n\\n She closed the book as one of the babies began to cry, and his brothers woke to join him. Rising, she went to the pallet beside her own to soothe, to sing, to offer her breast.\\n\\n You are my hope, she whispered, offering one a sugar teat for comfort while his brothers suckled.\\n\\n WHEN QUINN\u0027S EYES ROLLED BACK, CAL LIFTED her off her feet. \"We need to get her inside.\" His long, fast strides carried her to the steps leading to the side porch. Fox rushed ahead, getting the door, then going straight into the family\u0027s music room.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get some water.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll need more.\" Cybil hurried after him. \"Which way\u0027s the kitchen?\"\\n\\n He pointed, turned in the opposite direction.\\n\\n Because Quinn was shivering, Layla whipped a throw from the back of a small couch as Cal laid Quinn down.\\n\\n \"My head,\" Quinn managed. \"God, my head. It\u0027s off the Richter scale. I may be sick. I need to...\" She swung her legs over, dropped her head between her knees. \"Okay.\" She breathed in, breathed out as Cal massaged her shoulders. \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"Here, try some water. Fox got you some water.\" Layla took the glass he\u0027d brought back, knelt to urge it on Quinn.\\n\\n \"Take it easy,\" Cal advised. \"Don\u0027t sit up until you\u0027re ready. Slow breaths.\"\\n\\n \"Believe me.\" She eyed the brass bucket Gage set next to her, then shifted her gaze to the kindling now scattered over the hearth. \"Good thinking, but I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m not going to need that.\"\\n\\n She eased up until she could rest her throbbing head on Cal\u0027s shoulder. \"Intense.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" He pressed his lips lightly to the side of her head.\\n\\n \"Did I say anything? It was Ann. She was writing in her journal.\"\\n\\n \"You said plenty,\" Cal told her.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t I think to turn on my recorder?\"\\n\\n \"Got that.\" Gage held up her minirecorder. \"I pulled it out of your purse when the show started.\"\\n\\n She took a slow sip of water, glanced at Fox out of eyes still blurry in a pale, pale face. \"Your parents wouldn\u0027t happen to have any morphine around here?\"\\n\\n \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll pass.\" Cal kissed her again, rubbed gently at the back of her neck. \"Promise.\"\\n\\n \"How long was I gone?\"\\n\\n \"Nearly twenty minutes.\" Cal glanced over when Cybil came back in carrying a tall pottery mug.\\n\\n \"Here.\" Cybil stroked Quinn\u0027s cheek. \"This\u0027ll help.\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"Tea. That\u0027s all you have to know. Come on, be a good girl.\" She held the mug to Quinn\u0027s lips. \"Your mother has an amazing collection of homemade teas, Fox.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, but this tastes like-\" Quinn broke off when Joanne walked in. \"Ms. Barry.\"\\n\\n \"That blend tastes pretty crappy, but it\u0027ll help. Let me have her, Cal.\" Brushing Cal aside, Joanne took his place, then pressed and rubbed at two points at the base of Quinn\u0027s neck. \"Try not to tense. That\u0027s better. Breathe through it. Breathe the oxygen in, exhale the tension and discomfort. That\u0027s good. Are you pregnant?\"\\n\\n \"What? No. Um, no.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a point here.\" She took Quinn\u0027s left hand, pressed on the webbing between her thumb and forefinger. \"It\u0027s effective, but traditionally forbidden for pregnant women.\"\\n\\n \"The Adjoining Valley,\" Cybil said.\\n\\n \"You know acupressure?\"\\n\\n \"She knows everything,\" Quinn claimed, and took her first easy breath. \"It\u0027s better. It\u0027s a lot better. Down from blinding to annoying. Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"You should rest awhile. Cal can take you upstairs if you want.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, but-\"\\n\\n \"Cal, you ought to take her home.\" Layla stepped forward to pat a hand on Cal\u0027s arm. \"I can ride into the office with Fox. Cybil, you can get Gage back to Cal\u0027s, right?\"\\n\\n \"I could do that.\"\\n\\n \"We haven\u0027t finished,\" Quinn objected. \"We need to move on to part two and find out where she put the journal.\"\\n\\n \"Not today.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s right, Blondie. You haven\u0027t got another round in you.\" To settle the matter, Cal picked her up off the couch.\\n\\n \"Well, hard to argue. I guess I\u0027m going. Thanks, Ms. Barry.\"\\n\\n \"Jo.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Jo, for letting us screw up your morning.\"\\n\\n \"Anytime. Fox, give Cal a hand with the door. Gage, why don\u0027t you take Cybil back, let Brian know everything\u0027s all right? Layla.\" Jo put a hand on Layla\u0027s arm, holding her in place while the others left the room. \"That was smoothly done.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry?\"\\n\\n \"You maneuvered that so Quinn and Cal would have time alone, which is exactly what they both need. I\u0027m going to ask you a favor.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"If there\u0027s anything we can or should do, will you tell me? Fox may not. He\u0027s protective of those he loves. Sometimes too protective.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do what I can.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t ask for more than that.\"\\n\\n Fox waited for Layla to join him outside. \"You don\u0027t have to go into the office.\"\\n\\n \"Cal and Quinn need some space, and I\u0027d just as soon be busy.\"\\n\\n \"Borrow Quinn\u0027s car, or Cybil\u0027s. Go shopping. Do something normal.\"\\n\\n \"Work is normal. Are you trying to get rid of me?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to give you a break.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need a break. Quinn does.\" She turned as Cybil and Gage came out. \"I\u0027m going to go into the office for the day, unless you need me back at home.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got it covered,\" Cybil told her. \"Other than logging in this morning\u0027s fun and games, there isn\u0027t much else to do until we find the journal.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re putting a lot of stock in a diary,\" Gage commented.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the next step.\" Cybil shrugged.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t find it.\" Fox spread his hands. \"Maybe she wrote them, maybe she wrote them here-it seems clear she did. But I lived in this house and never got a glimmer. I went through it again last night, wide open. Walked around inside, out, the old shed, the woods. I got nothing.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you need me.\"\\n\\n His eyes latched on to Layla.\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s something we need to do together. We could try that. We\u0027ve still got a little time now. We could-\"\\n\\n \"Not now. Now while my parents are here in case... of anything. They\u0027ll both be away tomorrow, all morning.\" Out of harm\u0027s way, if there was any harm to be had. \"At the pottery, at the stand. We\u0027ll come back tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Fine with me. Well, cowboy.\" Cybil gestured to Quinn\u0027s car. \"Let\u0027s ride.\" She said nothing else until she and Gage were inside, pulling out ahead of Fox\u0027s truck. \"What does he think might happen that he doesn\u0027t want his parents exposed to?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing\u0027s ever happened here, or at Cal\u0027s parents\u0027 place. But, as far as we know, they\u0027ve never been connected before. So who the hell knows?\"\\n\\n She considered as she drove. \"They\u0027re nice people.\"\\n\\n \"About the best.\"\\n\\n \"You spent a lot of time here as a boy.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"God, do you ever shut up?\" she demanded after a moment. \"It\u0027s all talk, talk, talk with you.\"\\n\\n \"I love the sound of my own voice.\"\\n\\n She gave it another ten seconds of silence. \"Let\u0027s try another avenue. How\u0027d you do in the poker game?\"\\n\\n \"Did okay. You play?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been known to.\"\\n\\n \"Are you any good?\"\\n\\n \"I make it a policy to be good, or learn to be good, at everything I do. In fact-\"\\n\\n As she rounded the curve, she saw the huge black dog hunched in the middle of the road a few yards ahead. Meeting its eyes, Cybil checked the instinct to slam the brakes. \"Better hang on,\" she said coolly, then punched the gas instead.\\n\\n It leaped. A mass of black, the glint of fang and claw. The car shuddered at impact, and she fought to control it with her heart slammed in her throat. The windshield exploded; the hood erupted in flame. Again, she fought the instinct to hit the brakes, spun the car hard into a tight one-eighty. She prepared to ram the dog again, but it was gone.\\n\\n The windshield was intact; the hood unmarred.\\n\\n \"Son of a bitch, son of a bitch,\" she said, over and over.\\n\\n \"Turn around, and keep going, Cybil.\" Gage closed a hand over the one that clamped the steering wheel. It was cold, he noted, but rock steady. \"Turn the car around, and drive.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, okay.\" She shuddered once, hard, then turned the car around. \"So... What was I saying before we were interrupted?\"\\n\\n Sheer admiration for her chutzpah had a laugh rolling out of him. \"You got nerve, sister. You got nerves of fucking steel.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I wanted to kill it. I just wanted to kill it. And, well, it\u0027s not my car, so if I wrecked it running over a damn devil dog, it\u0027s Q\u0027s problem.\" And at the moment, her stomach was a quivering mess. \"It was probably stupid. I couldn\u0027t see anything for a minute, when the windshield... I could\u0027ve run us into a tree, or off the road into the creek.\"\\n\\n \"People who are afraid to try something stupid never get anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to pay it back, for what it did to Layla yesterday.
