{"id":85806,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"THE RAIN HUNG AROUND, IRRITATINGLY, INTO the kind of gloomy, windswept morning where sleeping in was mandatory. Or would\u0027ve been, Fox thought as he shut his apartment door behind him, if a guy didn\u0027t have demon research on his Sunday morning schedule.\\n\\n Despite the damp, he opted to walk the handful of blocks to Layla\u0027s. Like juggling, walking was thinking time. Apparently the other residents of the Hollow didn\u0027t share his view or had nothing much to think about. Cars crammed nose to ass at the curb outside Ma\u0027s Pantry and Coffee Talk, windshields running, bumpers dripping. And inside, he mused, people would be tucking into the breakfast special, getting their coffee topped off, complaining about the windy rain.\\n\\n From across the street, he eyeballed the new door on the bookstore and thought, Nice job, Dad. As Layla had done, he studied the Going Out of Business sign on the gift shop. Nothing to be done about that. Another business would move in. Jim Hawkins would find another tenant who\u0027d slap fresh paint on the walls and fill the place with whatevers. A Grand Opening sign would go up; customers would wander in to check it all out. Through the transition, people would still be eating the breakfast special, sleeping in on a rainy Sunday morning, or nagging their kids to get dressed for church.\\n\\n But things would change. This time, when the Seven came around, they\u0027d be more than ready for the Big Evil Bastard. They\u0027d do more than mop up the blood, put out the fires, lock up the deranged until the madness passed.\\n\\n They had to do more.\\n\\n Meanwhile, they\u0027d do the work, look for answers. They\u0027d had fun the night before, he mused. Hanging out, letting music and conversation wash away a long, hard day. Progress had been made during that day. He could feel all of them taking a step toward something.\\n\\n So while he might not be sleeping in or tucking into the breakfast special at Ma\u0027s, he\u0027d spend the day with friends, and the woman he wanted for his lover, working toward making sure others in the Hollow could keep right on doing the everyday, even during the week of July seventh, every seventh year.\\n\\n He made the turn at the Square, hands in the kangaroo pockets of his hooded sweatshirt, head ducked down in the rain.\\n\\n He glanced up idly as he heard the squeal of brakes on wet pavement. Fox recognized Block Kholer\u0027s truck, and thought, Shit, even before Block slammed out of it.\\n\\n \"You little son of a bitch.\"\\n\\n Now, as Block strode forward, ham-sized hands fisted, size fourteen Wolverines slapping the pavement, Fox thought: Shit.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to want to step back, Block, and calm down.\" They\u0027d known each other since high school, so Fox\u0027s hopes of Block doing either were slim. As tempers went, Block\u0027s was fairly mild-but once Block worked up a head of steam, somebody was going to get pounded.\\n\\n Since he sincerely didn\u0027t want it to be him, Fox tuned in and managed to evade the first swing.\\n\\n \"Cut it out, Block. I\u0027m Shelley\u0027s lawyer, that\u0027s reality. If I wasn\u0027t, somebody else would be.\"\\n\\n \"I heard that\u0027s not all you are.\" He swung again, missed again when Fox ducked. \"How long you been doing my wife, you cocksucker?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never been with Shelley that way. You know me, goddamn it. If you got that tune from Napper, consider who was whistling it.\"\\n\\n \"I got kicked out of my own goddamn house.\" Block\u0027s blue eyes were bright with rage in a wide face stained red with more. \"I gotta go into Ma\u0027s to get a decent breakfast because of you.\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t the one with my hand down my sister-in-law\u0027s shirt.\" Talk was his business, Fox reminded himself. Talk him down. So he kept his voice cool and even as he danced back from another punch. \"Don\u0027t hang this on me, Block, and don\u0027t do something now you\u0027re going to have to pay for.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to fucking pay.\"\\n\\n Fox was fast, but Block hadn\u0027t lost all the skill he\u0027d owned on the football field back in his day. He didn\u0027t punch Fox as much as mow him down. Fox hit the ivy-covered slope of a lawn-and the rocks underneath the drenched ivy-and slid painfully down to the sidewalk with the enraged former defensive tackle on top of him.\\n\\n Block outweighed him by a good fifty pounds, and most of that was muscle. Pinned, he couldn\u0027t avoid the short-armed, bare-knuckled punch to the face, or the punishing rabbit jabs in his kidneys. Through the vicious pain, the blurred vision, he could see a kind of madness on Block\u0027s face that had panic snaking in.\\n\\n And the thoughts sparking out were every bit as mad and murderous.\\n\\n Fox did the only thing left to him. He fought dirty. He clawed, going for those mad eyes. At Block\u0027s howl, he rammed his fist into the exposed throat. Block gagged, choked, and Fox had room to maneuver, to jam his knee between Block\u0027s legs. He got in a few punches, aiming for the face and throat.\\n\\n Run. That single thought bloomed like blood in Fox\u0027s mind. But when he tried to roll, crawl, fight his way clear and gain his feet, Block slammed Fox\u0027s head against the sidewalk. He felt something inside him break as the steel-toed boot kicked viciously at his side. Then he fought for air as meaty hands closed around his throat.\\n\\n Die here.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t know if it was Block\u0027s thoughts or his own circling in his screaming head. But he knew he was slipping away. His burning lungs couldn\u0027t draw air, and his vision was dimmed and doubled. He struggled to push what he had into this man he knew, a man who loved the Red-skins and NASCAR, who was always good for a bad, dirty joke and was a genius with engines. A man stupid enough to cheat on his wife with her sister.\\n\\n But he couldn\u0027t find it. He couldn\u0027t find himself or the man who was killing him on the sidewalk a few steps from the Town Square on a rainy Sunday morning.\\n\\n Then all he could see was red, like a field of blood. All he could see was his own death.\\n\\n The pressure on his throat released, and the horrible weight on his chest lifted. As he rolled, retching, he thought he heard shouting. But his ears rang like Klaxons, and he spat blood.\\n\\n \"Fox! Fox! O\u0027Dell!\"\\n\\n A face swam in front of his. Fox lay across the sidewalk, the rain blessedly cool on his battered face. He saw a blurred triple image of Chief of Police Wayne Hawbaker.\\n\\n \"Better not move,\" Wayne told him. \"I\u0027ll call an ambulance.\"\\n\\n Not dead, Fox thought, though the red still swam at the edges of his vision. \"No, wait.\" It croaked out of him, but he managed to sit up. \"No ambulance.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re hurt pretty bad.\"\\n\\n He knew his one eye was swollen shut, but he managed to focus the other on Wayne. \"I\u0027ll be okay. Where the fuck is Block?\"\\n\\n \"Cuffed and locked in the back of my car. Christ, Fox, I had to damn near knock him cold to get him off you. What the hell was going on here?\"\\n\\n Fox wiped blood from his mouth. \"Ask Napper.\"\\n\\n \"What does he have to do with it?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027d be the one who got Block worked up, making him think I\u0027d been screwing around with Shelley.\" Fox wheezed in another breath that felt like broken glass inside his throat. \"Never mind, doesn\u0027t matter. No law against lying to an idiot, is there?\"\\n\\n Wayne said nothing for a moment. \"I\u0027ll call down to the firehouse, get the paramedics here to look you over at least.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need them.\" As helpless anger, helpless pain churned inside him, Fox braced a bleeding hand on the sidewalk. \"I don\u0027t want them.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be taking Block in. I\u0027ll need you to come in when you\u0027re able, file formal assault charges.\"\\n\\n Fox nodded. Attempted murder was closer to the mark, but assault would do.\\n\\n \"Let me help you into the front of the car. I\u0027ll take you where you want to go.\"\\n\\n \"Just go on. I can get where I\u0027m going.\"\\n\\n Wayne dragged a hand through his wet, graying hair. \"Chrissakes, Fox, you want me to leave you on the sidewalk, bleeding?\"\\n\\n Once again, Fox focused his good eye. \"You know me, Chief. I heal quick.\"\\n\\n Acknowledgment and worry clouded Wayne\u0027s eyes. \"Let me see you get to your feet. I\u0027m not driving off until I know you can stand and walk.\"\\n\\n He managed it, every inch of him screaming. Three broken ribs, Fox thought. He could already feel them trying to heal, and the pain was hideous. \"Lock him up. I\u0027ll be in when I can.\"\\n\\n He limped off, didn\u0027t stop until he heard Hawbaker drive away. Then he turned, and stared at the grinning boy standing across the street.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll heal, you fucker, and when the time comes, I\u0027ll do a lot worse to you.\"\\n\\n The demon in a child\u0027s form laughed. Then it opened its mouth, wide as a cave, and swallowed itself.\\n\\n By the time Fox made it to the rental house, one of his ribs had healed, and the second was working on it. His loosened teeth were solid again; the most minor of the scrapes and cuts had closed.\\n\\n Should\u0027ve gone home to finish this up, he realized. But the beating and the agony of the healing left him exhausted and fuzzy-headed. The women would just have to deal with it, he told himself. They\u0027d probably have to deal with worse before it was over.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re up here!\" Quinn called down at the sound of the door opening, closing again. \"Be down in a minute. Coffee\u0027s on the stove, Coke\u0027s in the fridge, depending on who you are.\"\\n\\n The bruising on his windpipe was still too severe. He didn\u0027t have it in him to call back, so he made his way painfully to the kitchen.\\n\\n He started to reach for the refrigerator, frowned at his broken wrist. \"Come on, you bastard, finish it up.\" While the bones knit, he used his left hand to get out a Coke, then fought bitterly with the tab of the can.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re getting a late start. I guess we were- Oh my God.\" Layla rushed forward. \"Fox! God. Quinn, Cybil, Cal! Get down here. Fox is hurt!\"\\n\\n She tried to get an arm around him, take his weight. \"Just open this, will you? Open the stupid can.\"\\n\\n \"Sit down. You need to sit down. Your face. Your poor face. Here, sit down here.\"\\n\\n \"Just open the goddamn can.\" He snapped it out, but she only pulled out a chair. The fact that she could ease him down on it with little effort told him he was still in bad shape.\\n\\n She opened the can, started to cup his hands around it. Her voice was thin, but steady when she spoke. \"Your wrist is broken.\"\\n\\n \"Not for long.\"\\n\\n He took his first long, desperate sip as Cal ran in. One look had Cal cursing. \"Layla, get some water, some towels to clean him up some.\" He crouched, put a hand on Fox\u0027s thigh. \"How bad?\"\\n\\n \"Worst in a long time.\"\\n\\n \"Napper?\"\\n\\n \"Indirectly.\"\\n\\n \"Quinn,\" Cal said with his eyes still on Fox. \"Call Gage. If he isn\u0027t on his way, tell him to get here.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting ice.\" She dragged the ice bin out of the freezer. \"Cybil.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll call.\" But first she bent over, laid her lips gently on Fox\u0027s bloody cheek. \"We\u0027ll take care of you, baby.\"\\n\\n Layla brought a basin and cloth. \"It hurts. Can we give him anything for the pain?\"\\n\\n \"You have to go through it, even use it. It helps if the three of us are together.\" Cal\u0027s eyes never left Fox\u0027s face. \"Give me something.\"\\n\\n \"Ribs, left side. He got three, one\u0027s finished, one\u0027s working.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"They should go.\" He hissed on a fresh flood of pain. \"Tell them to go.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not going anywhere.\" Gently, efficiently, Layla began to stroke the cold damp cloth over Fox\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Here, honey.\" Quinn held the ice bag to Fox\u0027s swollen eye.\\n\\n \"I got him on his cell.\" Cybil hurried back in. \"He was already in town. He\u0027ll be here any second.\" She stopped, and despite her horror at Fox\u0027s condition, watched in fascination as the raw bruises on his throat began to fade.\\n\\n \"He messed me up inside,\" Fox managed. \"Can\u0027t focus, can\u0027t find it, but something\u0027s bleeding. Concussion. Can\u0027t think clear through it.\"\\n\\n Cal kept his gaze steady on Fox\u0027s face. \"Focus on that first, the concussion. You have to push the rest of it back.\"\\n\\n \"Trying.\"\\n\\n \"Let me.\" Layla shoved the bloodied cloths at Cybil before kneeling at Fox\u0027s feet. \"I can see if you let me in. But I need you to let me. Let me see the pain, Fox, so I can help you focus on it, heal it. We\u0027re connected. I can help.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t help if you freak. Remember that.\" He closed his eyes, and opened for her. \"Just the head. I can handle the rest once I clear that.\"\\n\\n He felt her shock, her horror, then her compassion. That was warm, soft. She guided him to where he needed to go just as she\u0027d guided him to the chair.\\n\\n And there, the pain was fierce and full, a monster with jagged teeth and stiletto claws. They bit, and mauled. They tore. For an instant he shied from it, started to struggle back. But she nudged him on.\\n\\n A hand gripped his sweaty fist, and he knew it was Gage.\\n\\n So he opened to himself, to them, rode on the pain, on the hot, bucking back of it, as he knew he must. When it ebbed enough for him to speak again, perspiration soaked him.\\n\\n \"Ease back now,\" he said to Layla. \"Ease back. It\u0027s a little too much, a little too fast.\"\\n\\n He kept riding the pain. Bones, muscles, organs. And clung unashamed to Gage\u0027s hand, to Cal\u0027s. When the worst had passed, and he could take his first easy breath, he stopped. His own nature would do the rest.\\n\\n \"Okay. It\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t look okay.\"\\n\\n He looked at Cybil, saw there were tears running down her cheeks. \"The rest is just surface. It\u0027ll take care of itself.\"\\n\\n When she nodded, turned away, he looked down at Layla. Her eyes were swimming, but to his relief, no tears fell. \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Who did this to you?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the question.\" His voice raw, Gage straightened, then walked to the stove for coffee. \"The second being, and when are we going to go kick the shit out of him?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to help with that.\" Cybil got a mug for Gage herself, then laid a hand over his, squeezed hard.\\n\\n \"It was Block,\" Fox told them as Quinn brought fresh water to clean the healing cuts and scrapes on his face.\\n\\n \"Block Kholer?\" Gage tore his gaze from his hand, still warm from Cybil\u0027s though she now stood two feet away. \"What the hell for?\"\\n\\n \"Napper convinced him I\u0027d screwed his wife.\"\\n\\n Cal shook his head. \"Block might be stupid enough to believe that asshole, which makes him monumentally stupid. And if he did, I could see him looking for some pushy-shovey, maybe even taking a swing at you. But, bro, he damn near killed you. That\u0027s just not...\"\\n\\n Fox managed a small, slow sip of the Coke when he saw Cal understood. \"It was there. The little fucker. Across the street. I had my attention on Block, since I sensed he wanted to pound me to pulp, so I missed it. I saw it in Block\u0027s face though, in his eyes. The infection. If Wayne Hawbaker hadn\u0027t come by, he wouldn\u0027t have damn near killed me. I\u0027d be dead.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s stronger.\" Quinn gripped Cal\u0027s shoulder. \"It\u0027s gotten stronger.\"\\n\\n \"We had to figure it would. Everything\u0027s accelerated this time. You said Wayne came by. What did he do?\"\\n\\n \"I was out of it at first. When I got it together, he had Block cuffed, locked in the car. He said he had to just about knock him cold to get him there. He was fine-Wayne-he was fine. Himself. Concerned, a little pissed, a lot confused. It didn\u0027t affect him.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it couldn\u0027t.\" Layla pushed to her feet. She took the bloodied water to dump because if her hands were in the sink, no one could see them shake. \"I think if it could have, it would have. You said Block meant to kill you. It wouldn\u0027t want the police, wouldn\u0027t want anyone to stop that from happening.\"\\n\\n \"One at a time.\" Composed again, Cybil pursed her lips. \"Not good news, but not all bad.\" She brushed at Fox\u0027s wet, tangled hair. \"Your eye\u0027s healing. You\u0027re almost back to full handsome again.\"\\n\\n \"What are you going to do about Block?\" Quinn asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go over and talk to him, and Wayne later. Right now, I could really use a shower, if you ladies don\u0027t mind.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take you up.\" Layla held out a hand.\\n\\n \"You need to sleep,\" Cal said.\\n\\n \"A shower\u0027s probably enough.\"\\n\\n \"That kind of healing empties you out. You know that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll start with the shower.\" He walked out with Layla. The pain still nipped, but its teeth were dull, its claws stunted.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll wash your clothes while you\u0027re in there,\" she told him. \"There are a few things of Cal\u0027s around here you can use. Those jeans are toast now anyway.\"\\n\\n He glanced down at his torn, ripped, and bloody Levi\u0027s. \"Toast? They\u0027re just broken in.\"\\n\\n She tried for a smile as they climbed the stairs, but couldn\u0027t quite pull it off. \"Does it still hurt?\"\\n\\n \"Mostly just sore now.\"\\n\\n \"Then...\" She turned at the top of the stairs, put her arms around him and held close.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right now.\"\\n\\n \"Of course it\u0027s not all right now. None of it\u0027s all right. So I\u0027m just going to hold on to you until I can handle it again.\"\\n\\n \"You handled it just fine.\" He lifted a hand, stroked it down her hair. \"Right down the line.\"\\n\\n Needing to be steady for him, Layla eased back to take his face carefully in her hands. His left eye looked red and painful, but the swelling was nearly gone. She kissed it, then his cheeks, his temples. \"I was scared to death.\"\\n\\n \"I know. That\u0027s what heroism is, isn\u0027t it? Doing what has to be done when you\u0027re scared to death.\"\\n\\n \"Fox.\" She kissed his lips now, gently. \"Take off your clothes.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been waiting to hear you say that for weeks.\"\\n\\n Now she was able to smile. \"And get in the shower.\"\\n\\n \"Better and better.\"\\n\\n \"If you need someone to wash your back... I\u0027ll send Cal.\"\\n\\n \"And my dreams are crushed.\"\\n\\n In the end, she untied his shoes while he sat on the side of the tub. She helped him out of his shirt and jeans with a depressingly sisterly affection. When he stood in his boxers, and she said, \"Oh, Fox,\" he knew by the tone it wasn\u0027t due to delight in his manly physique, but to the bruises that covered it.\\n\\n \"When so much is internal, it just takes longer for the outside to heal.\"\\n\\n She only nodded, and carrying his clothes, left him to shower.\\n\\n It felt like glory-the hot water, the soft spray. It felt like glory to be alive. He stayed under the water, his hands braced on the shower wall, until it ran cool, until the pain circled the drain and slid away like the water. Jeans and a sweatshirt sat neatly folded on the counter when he stepped out. He managed to get them on, forced to pause several times to rest, to wait until nasty little bouts of dizziness passed. Once he\u0027d wiped the steam from the mirror over the sink and taken stock of his face, the still-fading bruises, the raw look of his eye, the cuts not quite healed, he had to admit Cal was right, as usual.\\n\\n He needed to sleep.\\n\\n So he walked-felt like floating-into Layla\u0027s room. He crawled onto her bed and fell asleep with the comforting scent of her all around him.\\n\\n When he woke, there was a throw tucked around him, the shades were drawn and the door shut. He sat up carefully to take fresh stock. No pain, he thought, no aches. Not even when he poked his fingers around his left eye. The dragging fatigue no longer weighed on him. And he was starving. All good signs.\\n\\n He stepped out, found Layla in the office with Quinn. \"I dropped out awhile.\"\\n\\n \"Five hours.\" Layla moved to him immediately, searched his face. \"You look perfect. The sleep did you good.\"\\n\\n \"Five hours?\"\\n\\n \"And change,\" Quinn added. \"It\u0027s good to have you back.\"\\n\\n \"Somebody should\u0027ve shoved me out of bed. We were supposed to go through the rest of the first journal, at least.\"\\n\\n \"We did. And we\u0027re putting the notes together.\" Layla gestured to Quinn\u0027s laptop. \"We\u0027ll have the CliffsNotes version for you later. It\u0027s enough for now, Fox.\"\\n\\n \"I guess it has to be.\"\\n\\n \"Give yourself a break. Isn\u0027t that what you tell me? Cybil made some amazing leek and potato soup.\"\\n\\n \"Please tell me there\u0027s some left.\"\\n\\n \"Plenty, even for you. Come on, I\u0027ll fix you a bowl.\"\\n\\n Downstairs, Gage stood at the living room window. He glanced over. \"Rain stopped. I see you\u0027re back to your ugly self.\"\\n\\n \"Still prettier than you. Where\u0027s Cal?\"\\n\\n \"He headed over to the bowling alley a few minutes ago. He wants us to let him know when you decide to join the living again.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get the soup.\"\\n\\n Gage waited until he was alone with Fox. \"Fuel up, then we\u0027ll call Cal. He\u0027ll meet us at the police station. Quinn\u0027s putting the main points of today\u0027s reading session down for you.\"\\n\\n \"Anything major?\"\\n\\n \"It didn\u0027t answer anything for me, but you need to read it for yourself.\"\\n\\n He wolfed down two bowls of soup and a hunk of olive bread. By the time he finished, Quinn came down with a folder, and the journal. \"I think you\u0027ll get the gist from the synopsis, but since the rest of us have read this one, you should take it for tonight. In case you want to look anything over.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, for the notes, the soup, the TLC.\" He cupped Layla\u0027s chin, pressed his lips firmly to hers. \"Thanks for the bed. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\"\\n\\n When the men left, Cybil cocked her head. \"He\u0027s got very nice lips.\"\\n\\n \"He does,\" Layla agreed.\\n\\n \"And I think what I saw in the kitchen, when I watched him fight to heal, suffer to heal... I think it was the bravest thing I\u0027ve ever witnessed. You\u0027re a very lucky woman. And...\" She drew a piece of paper out of her pocket. \"You\u0027re also the lucky winner of today\u0027s whose turn is it to go to the market sweepstakes.\"\\n\\n Layla took the list and sighed. \"Woo hoo.\"\\n\\n CHIEF HAWBAKER STARED AT FOX\u0027S UNMARRED face when the three of them walked into the station house. Wayne had seen that sort of thing before, Fox thought. But he supposed it wasn\u0027t something most people got used to.\\n\\n The fact was, in the Hollow, most people just didn\u0027t notice, or pretended not to.\\n\\n \"I guess you\u0027re doing all right. I came by the house Ms. Black rented, seeing as you were hobbling off in that direction. A certain Ms. Kinski answered the door. Gave me quite a piece of her mind. But she said you were taken care of.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. How\u0027s Block?\"\\n\\n \"Had the paramedics come clean him up some.\" Wayne scratched at his jaw. \"Even so, he looks a lot worse than you. In fact, if I hadn\u0027t seen what went down, I\u0027d tend to think you went after him instead of the other way around. I think he must have hit his head.\" Hawbaker kept his eyes steady, and his voice just casual enough to let them know he was going to let Fox decide how to handle it. \"He doesn\u0027t remember it all very clearly. He did admit he went for you, went hard for you, but he\u0027s a little confused as to why.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to talk to him.\"\\n\\n \"I can arrange that. Should I be talking to Derrick?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s your deputy. But I\u0027d advise you to keep him clear of me. To keep him way clear.\"\\n\\n Wayne said nothing, only got the keys and led Fox through the offices, and into the detention area. \"He hasn\u0027t asked for a lawyer, hasn\u0027t asked to make a phone call. Block? Fox wants a word with you.\"\\n\\n Block sat on the cot in one of the three cells, with his head in his big, raw-knuckled hands. He sat up quickly, shoved to his feet. As Block strode to the bars, Fox saw the nasty cuts where he\u0027d clawed him. He didn\u0027t consider it petty to feel satisfaction over Block\u0027s two black eyes and split lip.\\n\\n \"Jesus, Fox.\" Block\u0027s black-and-blue eyes were as wide and pitiful as a kid\u0027s on time-out. \"I mean, Jesus H. Christ.\"\\n\\n \"Can we have a minute, Chief?\"\\n\\n \"That all right with you, Block?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, yeah, sure. Jesus H. Christ, Fox, I thought I beat the hell out of you. You\u0027re not hurt.\"\\n\\n \"You hurt me, Block. You damn near killed me, and that\u0027s what you were trying to do.\"\\n\\n \"But-\"\\n\\n \"You remember when I was playing second base back in our junior year, and the ball took a bad hop? It smashed right into my face. Bottom of the third, two out, runner on first. They thought maybe it broke my cheekbone. You remember how I was back on second in the bottom of the fourth?\"\\n\\n As both a little fear and a lot of confusion ran over his battered face, Block licked his swollen lip. \"I guess I sort of do. I was thinking maybe this was a dream. I was sitting here thinking that, and that it never really happened. But I guess it did. I swear to God Almighty, Fox, I don\u0027t know what came over me. I never went at anybody like that before.\"\\n\\n \"Did Napper tell you I\u0027d been at Shelley?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" In obvious disgust, Block kicked lightly at the bottom of the bars. \"Asshole. I didn\u0027t believe him. He hates your ever-fucking guts, and always has. \u0027Sides, I knew Shelley hadn\u0027t been running around. But...\"\\n\\n \"The idea of it gnawed at you.\"\\n\\n \"It did. I mean, shit, Fox, she kicked me out, and she\u0027s done served me with papers, and she won\u0027t talk to me.\" His fingers clamped around the bars as he hung his head. \"I got to thinking that, well, maybe it was because she had you on the side. Just maybe.\"\\n\\n \"And not because she caught you with Sami\u0027s tit in your hand?\"\\n\\n \"I screwed up. I screwed up bad. Shelley and me, we\u0027d been fighting some, and Sami-\" He broke off, shrugged. \"She\u0027d been coming on to me awhile, and that day, she says how I should come on into the back and help her with something. Then she\u0027s rubbing against me, and she\u0027s got a lot to rub against a man. She\u0027s got her shirt undone. Hell, Fox, her tit was right there. I screwed up bad.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, you did.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want a divorce. I wanna go home, Fox, you know?\" Misery coated the man-to-man appeal. \"Shelley won\u0027t even talk to me. I just wanna fix it, and she\u0027s talking around town about how you\u0027re going to skin my ass for her in court, and shit like that.\"\\n\\n \"Pissed you off,\" Fox prompted as Block frowned down at his boots.\\n\\n \"Jesus, Fox, it steamed me up, sure, then Napper\u0027s trash talk on top. But I\u0027ve never gone after somebody like that. I\u0027ve never beat on a man when he\u0027s done that way.\" Block\u0027s head lifted, and the confusion covered his face again. \"It was like being crazy or something. I couldn\u0027t stop. I thought maybe I\u0027d killed you. I don\u0027t know how I\u0027d live with that.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky for both of us you won\u0027t have to.\"\\n\\n \"Damn, Fox. I mean damn. You\u0027re a friend of mine. We go back. I don\u0027t know what... I guess I went crazy or something.\"\\n\\n Fox thought of the boy laughing, swallowing itself. \"I\u0027m not going to press charges, Block. We never had any problems, you and me.\"\\n\\n \"We get along okay.\"\\n\\n \"As far as I\u0027m concerned, we don\u0027t have any problems now. As for Shelley, I\u0027m her lawyer, and that\u0027s it. I can\u0027t tell you what to do about the state of your marriage. If you were to tell me that you want to try marriage counseling, I could pass that on to my client. I might be able to give her my opinion, as her lawyer and her friend, that she try that route before going any further with the divorce proceedings.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do anything she wants.\" Block\u0027s Adam\u0027s apple rippled as he took a hard swallow. \"I owe you, Fox.\"\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t. I\u0027m Shelley\u0027s lawyer, not yours. I want you to promise me that when Chief Hawbaker lets you out, you go home. Watch some NASCAR. Gotta be a race on today.\"\\n\\n \"Staying at my ma\u0027s. Yeah, I\u0027ll go on home. You got my word.\"\\n\\n Fox went back out to Wayne. \"I\u0027m not filing charges.\" He ignored Gage\u0027s muttered curse. \"Obviously I\u0027m not hurt. We had an altercation that looked more serious than it was, and is now resolved to the satisfaction of both parties.\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s the way you want it, Fox.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the way it is. I\u0027m grateful you came along when you did.\" Fox held out a hand.\\n\\n Outside, Gage cursed again. \"For a lawyer, you\u0027ve sure got a bleeding heart.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d have done the same. Exactly the same,\" he said before Gage could object. \"He wasn\u0027t responsible.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027d have done the same,\" Cal affirmed. \"And have. Why don\u0027t you come up to the center and watch the game?\"\\n\\n \"Tempting, but I\u0027ll pass. I\u0027ve got a lot of reading to do.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll drive you home,\" Gage told him.\\n\\n But for a few moments the three of them stood, just stood outside the station house looking over the town that was already under a cloud. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hollow-sign-of-seven-2/page-11.html","bookId":2249,"book":{"id":2249,"title":"The Hollow (Sign of Seven #2)","description":"Storyline: The Hollow (Sign of Seven #2) \\n In the small village of Hawkins Hollow, three best friends who share the same birthday sneak off into the woods for a sleepover the evening before turning 10.
