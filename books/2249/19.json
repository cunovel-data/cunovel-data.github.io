{"id":85814,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"COUNTING ON PAPERWORK TO KEEP HIM BUSY and distracted, Fox settled down in his home office. Flipping his CD player to shuffle for the variety and surprise factors, he prepared to make up for the fractured workday with a couple of hours at his desk.\\n\\n He drafted some court petitions on an estate case he hoped to wrap up within another ninety days, shifted to fine-tune a letter of response to opposing counsel on a personal injury matter, then moved on to adjusting the language in a partnership agreement.\\n\\n He loved the law, the curves and angles of it, its flourishes and hard lines. But at the moment, he was forced to admit, the work couldn\u0027t light a spark in him. He\u0027d be better off cruising ESPN.\\n\\n The file he\u0027d put together for Layla still sat on his desk. Because it annoyed him, Fox dropped it in a drawer. Stupid, he thought. Stupid to think he understood her simply because he usually understood people. Stupid to think he knew what she wanted because it was what he wanted.\\n\\n Love, he had good reason to know, didn\u0027t always do the job.\\n\\n Better to stay in the moment, he reminded himself. He was good at that, had always been good at that. Much better to focus on the now than to push himself, and Layla, toward some blurry and nebulous tomorrow. She had a point about there being no clear future for the town. Who the hell wanted to set up shop in a place that might not exist in a few months? Why should anyone invest the time and the energy, plant the roots, sweat it out, and hope the good guys won in the end? They\u0027d all gotten today\u0027s ugly memo that the clock was ticking down for the Hollow, and for the six of them.\\n\\n And that was bullshit. Annoyed, he shoved away from the desk. That was absolute bullshit. If people thought that way why did they bother to get the hell out of bed in the morning? Why did most of them at least try to do the right thing, or at least their version of it? Why buy a house or have kids, or hell, buy season tickets if tomorrow was so damn uncertain?\\n\\n Maybe he\u0027d been stupid to assume where Layla was concerned-he\u0027d cop to that. But she was just as stupid to back away from what they could make together because tomorrow wasn\u0027t lined up in neat columns. What he needed was a different approach, he realized. For Christ\u0027s sake, he was a lawyer, he knew how to change angles, detour around obstacles and reroute to the goal. He knew about compromise and negotiation and finding that middle ground.\\n\\n So what was the goal? he asked himself as he wandered to the window.\\n\\n Saving the town and the people in it, destroying the evil that wanted to suck it dry. Those were the big ones, but if he set those life-and-death matters aside, what was Fox B. O\u0027Dell\u0027s goal?\\n\\n Layla. A life with Layla. Everything else was just details. He\u0027d fumbled the ball on the way to the goal because he\u0027d gotten bogged down with details. The first thing to do was carve them away. Once he did, what was left was a guy and a girl. It was as simple and as complex as that.\\n\\n He turned back to his desk. He\u0027d toss the file, it was just a symbol of those details. As he reached for the drawer, the knock at the door had him frowning. It had to be Gage or Cal, he thought as he walked out of the office to answer. He didn\u0027t have time to hang out. He needed to work on his more simplified, whittled-down approach to winning the woman he loved.\\n\\n When he opened the door, the woman he loved stood on the other side.\\n\\n \"Hey, I was just... Are you alone?\" His tone changed from flustered surprise to irritation as he grabbed her hand and pulled her inside. \"What are you thinking, wandering around town at night alone?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t start on me. Twisse will go under after a day like this, and I wasn\u0027t wandering. I came straight here. You didn\u0027t come back.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know what the hell Twisse might be able to do after a day like this. And I didn\u0027t come back because I figured you\u0027d want to get some sleep. Besides, before this afternoon\u0027s performance, you weren\u0027t real happy with me.\"\\n\\n \"Which is exactly why I thought you\u0027d come back, so we could talk about it.\" She poked a finger at his chest. \"You don\u0027t get to be mad at me over this.\"\\n\\n \"Excuse me?\"\\n\\n \"You heard me. You don\u0027t get to be mad because I didn\u0027t jump headfirst into plans you made without consulting me.\"\\n\\n \"Wait a damn minute.\"\\n\\n \"No, I will not wait a damn minute. You decided what I should do for the rest of my life, where I should live, how I should make my living. You made a file.\" Indignation flashed from her eyes, her voice. From where he was standing, it all but flashed out of her fingertips. \"I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it includes paint chips and possible names for this imaginary boutique.\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking puce, color-wise. I don\u0027t think puce gets enough play. As for names, topping my list right now is Get a Fucking Grip-but it probably needs work.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t curse at me, or try to make this a joke.\"\\n\\n \"If those are your two requirements, you\u0027re in the wrong place with the wrong guy. I\u0027ll drive you home.\"\\n\\n \"You will not.\" Feet planted, she folded her arms. \"I\u0027ll walk when I\u0027m ready to go, and I\u0027m not ready. Don\u0027t even think about kicking me out or I\u0027ll-\"\\n\\n \"What?\" How could he help but make it a joke? It was ludicrous. He lifted his fists in a boxing pose. \"Think you can take me?\"\\n\\n The temper that gushed out of her was hot enough to boil the air. \"Don\u0027t tempt me. You sprang this on me. Out of the blue, then when I don\u0027t do a happy dance and fling myself into the program, you walk away. You tell me you love me, and you walk away.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, I guess I needed a little alone time after realizing the woman I\u0027m in love with isn\u0027t interested in building a life with me.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say-I never meant... Hell.\" Layla covered her face with her hands, took several deep breaths. The anger evaporated as she lowered her hands. \"I told you once you scare me. You don\u0027t understand that. You\u0027re not easily scared.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not true.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, yes, it is. You\u0027ve lived with this threat too long to be easily scared. You face things. Some of it\u0027s circumstance, some of it\u0027s just your nature, but you face what comes at you. I haven\u0027t had to do a lot of that. Things were pretty ordinary for me, right up until February. No big bumps in my road, no particularly big moments. All in all, I think I\u0027m doing reasonably well. All in all,\" she repeated on a sigh as she began to wander the room.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re doing fine.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m scared of what\u0027s here, of what\u0027s coming, what may happen. I don\u0027t have Quinn\u0027s energy or Cybil\u0027s... savoir faire,\" she decided. \"I do have persistence, once I commit to something I do my best to see it through, and I have a way of putting the big picture into components that I can reason out. So that\u0027s something. It\u0027s not as overwhelming, not as frightening when you have those smaller pieces to work with. But I can\u0027t seem to reason things out with you and me, Fox. And that scares me.\"\\n\\n She turned back to him. \"It scares me that I\u0027ve never felt for anyone what I feel for you. And I told myself it was okay, it was all right to have all these feelings rush in and grab me. Because everything\u0027s crazy. But the fact is, it\u0027s all crazy, but it\u0027s all real. What\u0027s happening around us, what\u0027s happening inside me, it\u0027s all real. I just don\u0027t know what to do about it.\"\\n\\n \"And I added to the mix with the idea of starting a business here, making it more complicated and scary. Understood. We\u0027ll take it off the table. I didn\u0027t look into it to put pressure on you. We\u0027ve all got enough of that as it is.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to be mad, because it\u0027s easier to be mad than scared. I don\u0027t want to be at odds with you, Fox. Everything that happened today... you were there. I woke up from that nightmare, and you were right there. Then you didn\u0027t come back.\" She closed her eyes. \"You didn\u0027t come back.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t go far.\"\\n\\n Emotion swam into her eyes when she opened them. \"I thought you might have. And that scared me more than anything else.\"\\n\\n \"I love you,\" he said simply. \"Where would I go?\"\\n\\n She launched herself into his arms. \"Don\u0027t go far.\" Her mouth found his. \"Don\u0027t kick me out. Let me be with you.\"\\n\\n \"Layla.\" He took her face in his hands, easing her back until their eyes met. \"All I want at the end of the day is for you to be with me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here. It\u0027s the end of the day, and I\u0027m here. That\u0027s where I want to be.\"\\n\\n Her lips were so soft, so giving. Her sigh, as her body molded to his, like music. Her hands brushed his face, through his hair as he circled her toward the bedroom. And in the dark, they lowered to the bed. She reached out, their legs tangling as they lay facing each other. As they stirred each other with long, lingering kisses, he could see the gleam of her eyes in the dark, the curve of her cheek, feel the shape of her lips and the beat of her heart against his.\\n\\n She shifted, kneeling to unbutton his shirt. Then her body bowed down as she pressed her lips to his heart. Lightly, her fingertips grazed down his sides as her mouth brushed, her tongue slicked along his skin. She felt his muscles quiver as she trailed those slow openmouthed kisses over his belly, as she flipped open the button of his jeans.\\n\\n She wanted him to quiver.\\n\\n She eased the zipper down, a slick hiss of sound in the dark, and drew denim down those narrow hips where the skin was warm. He groaned as she pleasured him.\\n\\n She ruled his body. Her mouth and hands guided him slowly, inexorably into the rocking sea of heat until he was drenched in it. And when the blood began to burn under his skin, she shifted again. He heard the soft rustle as she undressed.\\n\\n \"I want to ask you for something.\" She came toward him across the bed on her hands and knees and his mouth went dry as dust.\\n\\n \"If you want a favor, this is probably a good time to ask for it.\"\\n\\n Teasing, she lowered her lips to his, brushed, retreated. When he cupped the back of her head to bring her mouth to his again, she took it, brought it to her breast.\\n\\n \"When you touch me, when you make love with me, when you\u0027re inside me, can you feel what I feel? Can I feel what you feel? I want that with you. I want to know what it\u0027s like to be together that way, when we\u0027re like this.\"\\n\\n A gift, he thought, of complete trust, on both sides. He sat up, looked into her eyes. \"Open,\" he murmured, and rubbed his lips to hers. \"Just open.\"\\n\\n He felt her nerves, her needs, and the thoughts that came and went in her head like soft shimmers. To be wanted, to be touched. By him. When her hands ran up his back, he knew both her pleasure and her approval. He knew the press of their bodies, the beats of their hearts.\\n\\n Then easing her down, he deepened the kiss. And opened himself to her.\\n\\n At first it was like a sigh, through her body, through her mind. She thought: Lovely. It\u0027s lovely. Anticipation built. She turned her head to give him the pulse in her throat when she felt his need to taste there.\\n\\n Her breath caught, a quick little shock when his mouth took her breast. So much to feel, to know, she trembled with each new sensation that slipped and slid inside her, around her. His hands, her skin, his lips, her taste. Her needs tied, tangled with his on a free-falling leap.\\n\\n Greed-was it hers or his that had her rolling over the bed with him, desperate for more, and the more only unleashed new, wild cravings. His hands used her, rougher than before, answering her unspoken demands. Take, take, take. Pleasure swelled, unfurled, then burst with shock after radiant shock.\\n\\n Her nails bit, his teeth nipped. And when he drove into her she thought she\u0027d go mad from the force of mingled power.\\n\\n \"Stay with me, stay with me.\" Desperate, delirious, she wrapped her legs around him like chains when she sensed him start to close off. Pleasure, a two-edged sword, was brutally keen. She gripped it with him.\\n\\n She held his body, his thoughts, his heart, until neither could hold any longer.\\n\\n He sprawled facedown on the bed, head swimming, lungs laboring. He didn\u0027t have the strength, as yet, to ask her if she was all right, much less to try to link to make sure for himself.\\n\\n She\u0027d taken him apart, and he wasn\u0027t quite capable of putting himself back together. None of his thoughts would coalesce. He wasn\u0027t quite sure if there weren\u0027t still echoes of hers inside him.\\n\\n Still, after a few minutes, he realized he might die of thirst if he didn\u0027t crawl off for water.\\n\\n \"Water.\" He croaked it out.\\n\\n \"God. Please.\"\\n\\n He started to roll, bumped her where she\u0027d flung herself crossways on the bed. \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n He only grunted as he got his feet on the floor, then stumbled his way to the kitchen. The light in the refrigerator branded his eyes like the blaze of the sun. With one hand pressed over them, Fox felt his way over the shelves for a bottle of water.\\n\\n He drank half of it where he stood, naked in front of the open refrigerator, his eyes slammed shut against any source of light. Steadier, he opened his eyes to slits, grabbed a second bottle and took it into the bedroom.\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t moved a muscle.\\n\\n \"Are you all right? Did I-\"\\n\\n \"Water.\" Her hand flayed in the air. \"Water.\"\\n\\n He opened the bottle, then slid an arm under her to prop her up. Leaning back against his arm she drank with the same urgent gusto as he had.\\n\\n \"Are your ears ringing?\" she asked him. \"My ears are ringing. And I think I may be blind.\"\\n\\n He hauled her around so she was propped against the pillows instead of his arm, then he switched on the bedside light.\\n\\n She screamed and slapped a hand over her eyes. \"Okay, I wasn\u0027t blind, but now I may be.\" Cautiously she peeked out between two spread fingers. \"Have you ever...\"\\n\\n \"No. That was the first.\" Because his legs were still a little weak, he sat down beside her. Which was too bad, he mused, because he\u0027d liked the full-length view. \"Intense.\"\\n\\n \"Intense is too mild a word. There isn\u0027t a word. They need to invent one. I guess that\u0027s not something we could handle every time.\"\\n\\n \"Save it for special occasions.\"\\n\\n She smiled and stirred up the energy to sit up, rest her head on his shoulder. \"Arbor Day\u0027s coming up, I think. That\u0027s pretty special.\"\\n\\n He laughed, turned his head to rub his cheek against her hair. I love you, he thought, but kept the words to himself this time.\\n\\n SINCE FOX HAD OUTSIDE MEETINGS, LAYLA TOOK advantage of a slow afternoon to read over portions of Ann Hawkins\u0027s third journal. There was not, as they\u0027d hoped, a spell, a formula, step-by-step directions on how to kill a centuries-old demon. It led Layla to believe Giles Dent hadn\u0027t told his lover the answers. Cybil\u0027s take was more mystical, Layla supposed. If Ann knew, she also knew that whatever needed to be done to end Twisse would be diluted, even invalidated if the answers were simply handed over.\\n\\n That seemed too cryptic and irritating to Layla, so she spent considerable time trying to read between the lines. And came away from it frustrated and headachy. Why couldn\u0027t people just be straightforward. She liked step-by-step directions. And she was sure as hell going to record them, if they ever found them, used them, and were successful, on the off-chance some future generation had a similar problem.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you come back here?\" Layla muttered. \"Come on back and talk to me, Ann. Just spell it out. Then we\u0027ll all go about our normal lives.\"\\n\\n Even as she said it, Layla heard the front door creak open. She bulleted to her feet. Brian O\u0027Dell sauntered in.\\n\\n \"Hey, Layla. Sorry, did I startle you?\"\\n\\n \"No. A little. I wasn\u0027t expecting anyone. Fox is out of the office this afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. Well.\" Brian dipped his hands in his pockets, rocked back on his heels. \"I was in town, thought I\u0027d drop in.\"\\n\\n \"He probably won\u0027t be back until after six. If you want to leave a message-\"\\n\\n \"No. No big. You know, since I\u0027m here, maybe I\u0027ll just go back.\" He pulled a hand free to gesture with his thumb. \"Fox is talking about new flooring in the kitchen, and a couple of things. I\u0027ll just go measure. Want any coffee or anything?\"\\n\\n Layla tilted her head. \"How are you going to measure without a measuring tape?\"\\n\\n \"Right. Right. I\u0027ll get one out of the truck.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. O\u0027Dell, did Fox ask you to come in this afternoon?\"\\n\\n \"Ah. He\u0027s not here.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\" Like the son, Layla thought, the father was a poor liar. \"So he asked if you\u0027d come in, check on me. Which I might not have copped to except that your wife dropped in about an hour ago, with a dozen eggs. Putting that together with this, I smell babysitters.\"\\n\\n Brian grinned, scratched his head. \"Busted. He doesn\u0027t like you being here alone. I can\u0027t say I blame him.\" He strolled over, dropped into one of the visitors\u0027 chairs. \"I hope you\u0027re not going to give him a hard time about it.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" She sighed, sat herself. \"I guess, one way or another, we all worry about each other. But I\u0027ve got my cell in my pocket, and everyone I know on speed dial. Mr. O\u0027Dell-\"\\n\\n \"Brian.\"\\n\\n \"Brian. How do you handle it? Knowing what\u0027s happening, what may happen to Fox?\"\\n\\n \"You know, I was nineteen when Sage was born.\" In the language of a man settling in for a spell, he propped one work-booted foot on his knee. \"Jo was eighteen. Couple of kids who thought we knew it all, had it all covered. Then, you have a kid of your own, and the whole world shifts. There\u0027s a part of me that\u0027s been worried for thirty-three years now.\" He smiled as he said it. \"I guess there\u0027s just more parts of me worried when it comes to Fox. And truth? It pisses me off that he had his childhood, his innocence stolen from him. He came home that day, his tenth birthday, and he was never a little boy, not in the same way, again.\"\\n\\n \"Did he tell you what happened? The morning he came back from the Pagan Stone?\"\\n\\n \"I like to think we got a lot right with our kids, but one thing I know we got right. They know they can tell us anything. He\u0027d spun that one about camping out in Cal\u0027s backyard, but Jo and I saw through that.\"\\n\\n \"You knew he was going to spend the night in the woods?\"\\n\\n \"We knew he was taking an adventure, and we gave him the room. If we hadn\u0027t, he\u0027d\u0027ve found a way around it. Birds have to fledge. You can\u0027t stop it, no matter how much you want to keep them safe in the nest.\"\\n\\n He paused a moment, and Layla could see him looking back, wondered what it was like to look back over the course of another\u0027s lifetime. Someone you loved.\\n\\n \"He had Gage with him when he came home,\" Brian continued. \"You could see, in both of them, something had changed. Then they told us, and everything changed. We talked about leaving. Jo and I talked about selling the farm and moving on. But he needed to be here. After the week was up, we all thought it was over. But more than that, we knew Fox needed to be here, with Cal and Gage.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve seen him face this three times before, and now he\u0027s facing it again. I think it must take tremendous courage to accept what he\u0027s doing. Not to try to stop him.\"\\n\\n The smile was easy, the smile clear. \"It\u0027s not courage, it\u0027s faith. I have complete faith in Fox. He\u0027s the best man I know.\"\\n\\n Brian stayed until she closed the office, then insisted on driving her home. The best man I know, she mused as she walked in the house. Was there a higher tribute from father to son? She walked upstairs to take the journal back to the home office.\\n\\n Quinn sat at her desk, scowling at her monitor.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s it going?\"\\n\\n \"Crappy. I\u0027m on deadline with the article, and I can\u0027t keep my head in the game.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry. I\u0027ll go down, give you the room.\"\\n\\n \"No. Shit.\" She shoved away. \"I shouldn\u0027t have said I\u0027d write the stupid article except, hello, money. But we\u0027ve been pushing on this idea of the blood ritual, and clever words to go with it, and Cybil\u0027s snarly.\"\\n\\n \"Where is she?\"\\n\\n \"Working in her room because apparently I think too loud.\" Quinn waved it away. \"We get like this with each other if we work on a project for any serious length of time. Only she gets like this more. I wish I had a cookie.\" Quinn propped her chin on her hand. \"I wish I had a bag of Milanos. Crap.\" She picked up the apple from the desk, bit in. \"What are you smiling at, size freaking two?\"\\n\\n \"Four, and I\u0027m smiling because it\u0027s reassuring to come home and find you in this lousy mood wishing for cookies, and Cybil holed up in her room. It\u0027s so normal.\"\\n\\n With something between a grunt and a snort, Quinn took another bite of apple. \"My mother sent a swatch for bridesmaids\u0027 gowns. It\u0027s fuchsia. How\u0027s that for normal, Sunny Jane?\"\\n\\n \"I could wear fuchsia if I had to. Please don\u0027t make me.\"\\n\\n Blue eyes wickedly amused, Quinn chewed and smiled. \"Cyb would look horrible in fuchsia. If she keeps crabbing at me, I\u0027ll make her wear it. You know what? We need to get out of here for a while. All work, no play. We\u0027re taking tomorrow off and shopping for my wedding dress.\"\\n\\n \"Seriously?\"\\n\\n \"Seriously.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you\u0027d never ask. I\u0027ve been dying to do this. Where-\"\\n\\n Layla turned as Cybil\u0027s door opened. \"We\u0027re going shopping. For Quinn\u0027s wedding gown.\"\\n\\n \"Good, that\u0027s good.\" At the doorway, Cybil leaned on the jamb, studied both her friends. \"That\u0027s what we could call a ritual-a white one, a female one. Unless we want to take a closer look at the symbolism. White equals virginal, veil equals submission-\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t,\" Quinn interrupted. \"I will, without shame, toss my feminist principles to the wind for the perfect wedding dress. I\u0027ll live with it.\"\\n\\n \"Right. Well, anyway...\" Absently, Cybil shoved back her mass of hair. \"It\u0027s still a female ritual. Maybe it\u0027ll balance out what we\u0027ll be doing in another two weeks. Blood magic.\"\\n\\n FOX DROVE STRAIGHT TO LAYLA\u0027S AFTER HIS APPOINTMENTS. She opened the door as he started up the walk, her hair swinging, her lips curved in a welcoming smile. Could he help it if that was exactly what he hoped to come home to every night?\\n\\n \"Hey.\" He leaned down to kiss her, leaned up and cocked his head at the absent response. \"Why don\u0027t we try that again?\"\\n\\n \"Sorry. I\u0027m distracted.\" She took the lapels of his jacket in her hands, and put herself into the kiss.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m talking about.\" But he saw now there was no reflection of that smile of greeting in her eyes. \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\\n\\n \"Did you get my voice mail?\"\\n\\n \"Meeting here, as soon as I could make it. I made it.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re in the living room. It\u0027s-Cybil thinks she\u0027s nailed down the blood ritual.\"\\n\\n \"Fun and games for all.\" Concerned, he brushed his thumb over her cheekbone. \"What\u0027s the problem?\"\\n\\n \"She- She\u0027s waiting until you get here to explain it to the three of you.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever she explained to you didn\u0027t put roses in your cheeks.\"\\n\\n \"Some of the variables on the potential outcome aren\u0027t rosy.\" She took his hand. \"You\u0027d better hear it for yourself. But before... I have to tell you something else.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"Fox...\" Her fingers tightened on his, as if in comfort. \"Can we just sit here a minute?\"\\n\\n They sat on the porch steps, looking out at the quiet street. Her hands clasped on her knee, one of her signs- Gage would call it a tell-of nerves. \"How bad is it?\" Fox asked her.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know how you\u0027ll feel about it.\" She pressed her lips together once, hard. \"I\u0027m going to say it straight out, then you can take whatever time you need to, well, absorb it. Carly was connected. To this. She was a descendent of Hester Deale\u0027s.\"\\n\\n It hit him, a hard, fast punch to the solar plexus. His thoughts spun, so he asked the first question that popped. \"How do you know?\"\\n\\n \"I asked Cybil-\" She broke off, shifted to face him, started again. \"It seemed that there had to be a reason for what happened, Fox, a reason she was infected so quickly, so... fatally. So I asked Cybil to look into it, and she has been.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you say anything to me?\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t sure, and if I\u0027d been wrong, I\u0027d have upset you for nothing. And... I should\u0027ve told you,\" she amended. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" The spinning stopped; the ache just under his heart eased. She\u0027d wanted to shield him until supposition became fact and he\u0027d have done exactly the same. \"No, I get it. Cybil climbed Carly\u0027s family tree?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Tonight she told me she\u0027d found the connection. She has the details of the genealogy if you want to see them.\"\\n\\n When he only shook his head, she went on. \"I don\u0027t know if this makes it better for you, or worse, or if it changes nothing. But I thought you should know.\"\\n\\n \"She was part of it,\" he said quietly. \"All along.\"\\n\\n \"Twisse used that, and you, and her. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m so sorry, but nothing you did, nothing you didn\u0027t do would have changed that.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s true, but there\u0027s nothing I can do now to change it. Maybe we found each other, Carly and me, because of this. But then we made choices, both of us, that led to the end of it. Different choices, maybe a different result. No way to know.\"\\n\\n After a moment, he laid his hand over hers. \"There\u0027s always going to be guilt, and grief, when I think of her. But now, I know at least part of the why. I never understood why, Layla, and that twisted me up.\"\\n\\n \"Twisse took her to hurt you. And was able to take her, the way he did, because she was of his bloodline. And because...\"\\n\\n \"Keep going,\" he told her when she trailed off.\\n\\n \"I think because she didn\u0027t believe, not really. She didn\u0027t believe enough to be afraid, or to fight, even to run. That\u0027s just speculation, and I might be overstepping, but-\"\\n\\n \"No.\" He said it quietly. \"No, you\u0027re exactly right. She didn\u0027t believe, even when she saw with her own eyes.\" He lifted his free hand, studied the unmarred palm. \"She told me what she thought I wanted to hear, promised to stay at the farm that night without ever intending to keep the promise. She was built skeptical, she couldn\u0027t help it.\"\\n\\n He closed his hand into a loose fist, lowered it. And for the first time in nearly seven years, he let it go. \"I never thought of a connection. That was smart. And you were right to tell me.\" He lifted their hands, slid his fingers between hers. \"Being up-front with each other, even when it\u0027s hard, that\u0027s the best choice for us.\"\\n\\n \"I want to say this one thing more before we go in. If I promise you something-if you ask me to do something, or not to, and I give you my promise, I\u0027ll keep it.\"\\n\\n Understanding, he brought their joined hands to his lips. \"And I\u0027ll believe what you tell me. Let\u0027s go inside.\"\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t change the past, Fox thought. He could only prepare for the future. But he could prize and hold the now. Layla was his now. The people in this house were his as well. They needed him, and he needed them. That was enough for any man.\\n\\n He settled into his usual spot on the floor with Lump. Whatever was in the air, Fox thought, was something between nerves and fear. That was from the women. From Cal and Gage he sensed both interest and impatience.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on? And whatever it is, let\u0027s get on with it.\"\\n\\n Cybil took the stage.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve talked with a number of people I know and, for the most part, trust, regarding performing a blood ritual, the object being to re-form the three pieces of Dent\u0027s bloodstone into one. We\u0027re assuming that\u0027s something we need to do. There are a lot of assumptions here based on bits and pieces of information, on speculation.\"\\n\\n \"The three separate pieces haven\u0027t done us much good up till now,\" Gage pointed out.\\n\\n \"Well, you don\u0027t know that, do you?\" Cybil tossed back. \"It\u0027s very possible that those individual pieces are what\u0027s given you your gifts-your sight, your healing. Once whole, you might lose that. And without those gifts in your arsenal, you\u0027ll be all the more vulnerable to Twisse.\"\\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t put them back together,\" Cal pointed out, \"they\u0027re just three pieces of stone we don\u0027t understand. We agreed to try. We have tried. If you\u0027ve found another way, that\u0027s what we\u0027ll try next.\"\\n\\n \"Blood rites are powerful and dangerous magicks. We\u0027re dealing with a powerful and dangerous force already. You need to know all the possible consequences. All of us need to know. And all of us have to agree because all of us need to be part of it for the ritual to have any chance of working. I\u0027m not going to agree until everyone understands.\"\\n\\n \"We get it.\" Gage shrugged. \"Cal may need to dig out his glasses, and the three of us will be susceptible to the common cold.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t make light of this.\" Cybil turned to him. \"You could lose what you have, and more. It could all blow up in our faces. You\u0027ve seen that possibility. The mix of blood and fire, the stone on the stone. Every living thing consumed. It was your blood that let the demon out. We need to consider that performing this rite could loose something worse.\"\\n\\n \"You have to play to win.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s right.\" Fox nodded at Gage. \"We risk it, or we do nothing. We believe Ann Hawkins or we don\u0027t. This was the time, that\u0027s what she told Cal. This Seven is the all or nothing, and the stone-whole-is a potential weapon. I believe her. She sacrificed her life with Dent, and that sacrifice led to us. One into three, three into one. If there\u0027s a way, we go.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s another three. Q, Layla, and me. Our blood, tainted if you will, with that of the demon.\"\\n\\n \"And carrying that of the innocent.\" Layla sat with her hands folded, as if she held something delicate inside them. \"Hester Deale wasn\u0027t evil. Innocent blood, you said, Cybil, innocent blood is a powerful element in ritual.\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027m told.\" Cybil let out a sigh. \"I was also warned that the innocent can be used to give the demon strain more power. That a ritual such as we\u0027re suggesting could be an invitation. Three young boys were changed by a blood rite on that ground. It could happen again, with us.\" She looked at Layla, at Quinn. \"And what\u0027s diluted, or dormant, or just outweighed in us by who we are, could rise.\"\\n\\n \"Not going to happen.\" Quinn spoke briskly. \"Not only because I don\u0027t consider horns and cloven feet a fashion statement but\"-she ignored Cybil\u0027s annoyed oath- \"because we won\u0027t let it. Cyb, you\u0027re too goddamn hard-headed to let a little demon DNA run your show. And you\u0027re not responsible. Don\u0027t even,\" Quinn ordered when Cybil started to speak. \"Nobody knows you like I do. If we vote go, we\u0027re all in it, we\u0027re all making the choice. And whatever happens, thumbs-up or -down, it\u0027s not on you. You\u0027re just the messenger.\"\\n\\n \"Understand if it goes wrong, it could go seriously and violently wrong.\"\\n\\n \"If it goes right,\" Fox reminded Cybil, \"it\u0027s a step toward saving lives. Toward ending this.\"\\n\\n \"More likely we\u0027ll lose a little blood and not a damn thing will change. Any way you look at it, it\u0027s a long shot,\" Gage added. \"I like a long shot. I\u0027m in.\"\\n\\n \"Anyone not?\" Quinn scanned the room. \"That\u0027s a big go.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s get started.\"\\n\\n \"Not so fast, big guy,\" Cybil said to Gage. \"While the ritual\u0027s pretty straightforward, there are details and procedure. It requires the six of us-boy-girl, boy-girl-like any good dinner party, in the standard ritual circle. On the ritual ground at the Pagan Stone. Cal, I don\u0027t suppose you have the knife you used before?\"\\n\\n \"My Boy Scout knife? Sure I do.\"\\n\\n \"Sure he does.\" Charmed, Quinn leaned over to kiss his cheek.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll need that. I have a list of what we\u0027ll need. And we\u0027ll work out the wording of the incantation. We have to wait for the night of the full moon, and begin in the half hour before midnight, finish before the half hour after.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n \"Ritual requires ritual,\" she snapped at Gage. \"And respect, and a hell of a lot of faith. The full moon gives us light, literally and magickally. The half hour before midnight is the time of good, and the half hour after, evil. That\u0027s the time, that\u0027s the place, and that\u0027s our best shot of making it work. Think of it as stacking the odds in our favor. We\u0027ve got two weeks to fine-tune it, work out the kinks-or to call off the whole deal and go to St. Barts. Meanwhile...\" She looked into her empty glass. \"I\u0027m out of wine.\"\\n\\n As the discussion started immediately, Gage slipped off to follow Cybil into the kitchen. \"What\u0027s got you spooked?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know.\" She poured herself a generous glass of cabernet. \"Must be the death and damnation.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t spook easy, so spill.\"\\n\\n She took a small sip as she turned to him. \"You\u0027re not the only one who gets previews of coming attractions.\"\\n\\n \"What did you see this time?\"\\n\\n \"I saw my best friend die, and the death of the woman I\u0027ve come to love and respect. I saw the men who love them die trying to save them. I saw your death in blood and fire. And I lived. Why is that worse? That I saw everyone die, and I lived.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds more like nerves and guilt than a premonition.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t do guilty, as a rule. On the plus side, in my dream it worked. I saw the bloodstone whole, resting on the Pagan Stone under the light of the full moon. And for a moment, it was brighter than the sun.\"\\n\\n She took a long, quiet breath. \"I don\u0027t want to walk out of the clearing alone, so do me a favor. Don\u0027t die.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see what I can do.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hollow-sign-of-seven-2/page-19.html","bookId":2249,"book":{"id":2249,"title":"The Hollow (Sign of Seven #2)","description":"Storyline: The Hollow (Sign of Seven #2) \\n In the small village of Hawkins Hollow, three best friends who share the same birthday sneak off into the woods for a sleepover the evening before turning 10.
