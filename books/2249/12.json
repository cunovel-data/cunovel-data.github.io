{"id":85807,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"FOX SPENT A LONG TIME READING, MAKING HIS own notes, checking back over specific passages Quinn had marked in the journal.\\n\\n He juggled and mulled, and read more.\\n\\n No guardian ever had succeeded in destroying the Dark. Some gave their lives in the attempt. Giles prepared to give his, as no other had before him.\\n\\n No precedent for whatever mumbo-jumbo Dent had used that night in the woods, Fox considered. Which meant he couldn\u0027t have been sure it would work. But he was willing to risk his life, his existence. Hell of a gamble, even considering he\u0027d sent Ann, and the lives in her, to safety first.\\n\\n He has gone beyond what has been done, what was deemed could be done. The blood of the innocent is shed, and so it will be, my love believes, dark against dark. And it will be my love who pays the price for this sin. It will be blood and fire, and it will be sacrifice and loss. Death on death before there is life, before there is hope.\\n\\n Ritual magic, Fox decided, and used laundry and housekeeping chores as he had juggling. Blood magic. He glanced at the scar on his wrist. Then, and three hundred years later. Blood and fire at the Pagan Stone in Dent\u0027s time, and blood, in a boyhood ritual in theirs. A campfire, the words he and Cal and Gage had written down to say together when Cal made the cuts.\\n\\n Young boys-the blood of the innocent.\\n\\n He toyed with various ideas and strategies as he thought of them. He climbed into bed late, on righteously clean sheets, to let himself sleep on it.\\n\\n It came to him in the morning, while he was shaving. He hated shaving, and as he did many mornings, considered growing a beard. But every time he attempted one, it itched, and it looked stupid. Talk about pagan rituals, he mused as he drew blade through lather and over skin. Every freaking morning unless a guy wanted the hairy face, he had to scrape some sharp implement over his throat until-shit.\\n\\n He nicked himself, as he nearly always did, pressed a finger to the wound that would close again almost before it bled. The sting came and went, and still he scowled in disgust at his blood-smeared fingertip.\\n\\n Then stared.\\n\\n Life and death, he thought. Blood was life, blood was death.\\n\\n Dull horror embedded in his brain, in his heart. Had to be wrong, he told himself. Yet it made terrible sense. It was a hell of a strategy, if you\u0027re willing to shed innocent blood.\\n\\n What did it mean? he asked himself. What did it make Dent, if this had been his sacrifice?\\n\\n What did it make all of them?\\n\\n He twisted and turned it in his head as he made himself finish shaving, as he dressed and readied for the workday. He had the Town Council breakfast meeting, and as town lawyer, he couldn\u0027t get out of it. Probably for the best, he decided as he grabbed his jacket, his briefcase. It was probably best to let this stew. Probably best to wait, think, before he broached the idea to the others. Even to Cal and Gage.\\n\\n He ordered himself to put his head into the meeting, and though painting Town Hall and new plantings at the Square weren\u0027t high on his current list of priorities, he thought he\u0027d done a good job of it.\\n\\n But Cal was on him the minute they walked out of Ma\u0027s. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"I think Town Hall needs a new coat of paint, and damn the expense.\"\\n\\n \"Cut it out. You left half your breakfast on your plate. When you don\u0027t eat, something\u0027s up.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m working on something, but I need to fine-tune it, to look at it some more before I talk about it. Plus, Sage is in town. I\u0027m meeting her and the family for lunch at Sparrow\u0027s, ergo, my appetite\u0027s already dead.\"\\n\\n \"Walk up to the center with me, run it by me.\"\\n\\n \"Not now. I\u0027ve got stuff anyway. I\u0027ve got to digest this, which is an easier proposition than the lentils I\u0027ll probably get stuck with at lunch. We\u0027ll roll it over tonight.\"\\n\\n \"All right. You know where I am if you want to roll it sooner.\"\\n\\n They separated. Fox pulled out his cell phone to contact Shelley. There, at least, he\u0027d worked out his approach. As he talked to her about coming into the office, listened to her latest idea of retribution on Block, Derrick Napper passed by in his cruiser. Napper slowed, grinned, and lifted his middle finger from the steering wheel.\\n\\n Fox thought, Asshole, and kept walking. He closed the phone as he reached his office door.\\n\\n \"Morning, Mrs. H.\"\\n\\n \"Good morning. How was the meeting?\"\\n\\n \"I suggested the image of a naked Jessica Simpson as the new town symbol. It\u0027s currently under consideration.\"\\n\\n \"That ought to get the Hollow some attention. I\u0027m only in for an hour this morning. I called Layla, and she\u0027s fine coming in early.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"I have an appointment with our real estate agent. We sold the house.\"\\n\\n \"You-when?\"\\n\\n \"Saturday. A lot to do,\" she said briskly. \"You\u0027ll handle the settlement for us, won\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, of course.\" Too fast, he thought. This was happening too fast.\\n\\n \"Fox, I won\u0027t be coming in after today. Layla can handle everything now.\"\\n\\n \"But-\" But what, he thought. He\u0027d known this was coming.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve decided to drive out to Minneapolis, and take our time. We\u0027ve got most everything packed up, and ready to ship out. Our girl\u0027s found a condo she thinks we\u0027ll like, only a few miles from her. I\u0027ve drawn up a limited power of attorney for you, so you can handle the settlement. We won\u0027t be here for it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll look it over. I have to run upstairs. I\u0027ll be back in a minute.\"\\n\\n \"Your first appointment\u0027s in fifteen minutes,\" she called after him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be back in one.\"\\n\\n He was true to his word, and walked straight to her desk. He put a wrapped box in front of her. \"It\u0027s not a going-away present. I\u0027m too mad at you for leaving me to give you a present for that. It\u0027s for everything else.\"\\n\\n \"Well.\" She sniffled a little as she unwrapped the box, and made him smile at the way she preserved the paper, folded it neatly before opening the lid.\\n\\n They were pearls, as dignified and traditional as she was. The clasp was fashioned as a jeweled bouquet of roses. \"I know how you are about flowers,\" he began when she said nothing. \"So these caught my eye.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re absolutely beautiful. Absolutely-\" Her voice cracked. \"They\u0027re too expensive.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m still the boss around here.\" He took them out, put them around her neck himself. \"And you\u0027re part of the reason I can afford them.\" His credit card had let out a single short scream on being swiped, but the look on her face made it all worthwhile. \"They look nice on you, Mrs. H.\"\\n\\n She brushed her fingertips over the strand. \"I\u0027m so proud of you.\" Rising, she put her arms around him. \"You\u0027re such a good boy. I\u0027ll think of you. I\u0027ll pray for you.\" She sighed, stepped back. \"And I\u0027ll miss you. Thank you, Fox.\"\\n\\n \"Go ahead. You know you want to.\"\\n\\n She managed a watery laugh and rushed to a decorative wall mirror. \"Oh my goodness! I feel like a queen.\" In the glass her eyes met his. \"Thank you, Fox, for everything.\"\\n\\n When the door opened, she bustled back to her desk to log in his first appointment. By the time he escorted the client out again, she was gone.\\n\\n \"Alice said you and she had said your good-byes.\" Understanding shone in Layla\u0027s eyes. \"And she showed off her pearls. You did good there. They couldn\u0027t have been more perfect.\"\\n\\n \"Stick around a few years, you may cop some.\" He rolled his shoulders. \"Gotta shake it off, I know. Listen, Shelley\u0027s coming in-a quick squeeze-in.\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to tell her about what happened with Block?\"\\n\\n \"Why would I?\"\\n\\n \"Why would you?\" Layla murmured. \"I\u0027ll pull her file.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m hoping we won\u0027t need it. Let me ask you something. If you loved a guy enough to marry him, and he screwed up big time, would that just be it? Say you still love him. One of the reasons you fell in the first place was because he wasn\u0027t altogether bright, but pretty affable, and he loved you back. Or would you give him another chance?\"\\n\\n \"You want Shelley to give him another chance.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Shelley\u0027s lawyer, so I want what she wants, within reason. Maybe what she wants is marriage counseling.\"\\n\\n \"You asked her to come in so you can suggest she might want to try counseling.\" Studying him, Layla nodded slowly. \"After he beat the crap out of you?\"\\n\\n \"Extenuating circumstances there. She doesn\u0027t want the divorce, Layla. She just wants him to feel as crappy as she does and more so. I\u0027m just going to give her another option. The rest is up to her. So, would you give him another chance?\"\\n\\n \"I believe in second chances, but it would depend. How much did I love him, how much did I make him pay before giving him that second chance. Both would have to be a lot.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I figured. Just send her back when she gets here.\"\\n\\n Layla sat where she was. She thought of Alice\u0027s damp eyes and beautiful pearls. She thought of Fox bleeding in the kitchen, and the pain that leeched every drop of color from his face. She thought of him playing guitar in a noisy bar, and running toward a burning house to save the dogs.\\n\\n When Shelley came in, eyes glittering with fury and misery, Layla sent her back. She thought a great deal more as she answered the phone, as she finished the Monday morning business Alice had begun.\\n\\n When Shelley came out again, she was weeping a little, but there was something in her eyes that hadn\u0027t been in them when she\u0027d come in. And that was hope.\\n\\n \"I want to ask you something.\"\\n\\n Here, Layla thought, we go again. \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"Would I be a complete fool if I called this number?\" She held out a business card. \"If I made an appointment with this marriage counselor Fox said is really good? If I gave that idiot Block a chance and saw if maybe we could fix things between us?\"\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027d be a complete fool if you didn\u0027t do whatever it takes to get what you want most.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why I want that man.\" Shelley looked down at the card in her hand. \"But I guess maybe this could help me find out. Thanks, Layla.\"\\n\\n \"Good luck, Shelley.\"\\n\\n What was the point in being a complete fool? Layla asked herself. Before she bogged down in what-ifs and maybes, she pushed back from her desk and marched straight back to Fox\u0027s office.\\n\\n He hammered at the keyboard, brows knitted. He barely gave her a grunt as she stepped to his desk.\\n\\n \"All right,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll sleep with you.\"\\n\\n His fingers paused. He cocked his head up, aimed his eyes to hers. \"This is excellent news.\" Swiveling, he faced her more fully. \"Right now?\"\\n\\n \"This is so easy for you, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Actually-\"\\n\\n \"Just \u0027sure, let\u0027s go.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"I feel, under the circumstances, I shouldn\u0027t have to point out that yes, I am a guy.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not just that.\" She threw out her arms as she whirled into a pace. \"I bet you were raised to think of sex as a natural act, as a basic form of human expression, even a physical celebration between two consenting adults.\"\\n\\n He waited a beat. \"Isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Stopping, facing him, she made a helpless gesture with her hands. \"I was raised to think of it as an enormous and weighty step. One that carries responsibility, that has repercussions. That because sex and intimacy are synonymous, you don\u0027t just go around jumping into bed because you want an itch scratched.\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re going to sleep with me anyway.\"\\n\\n \"I said I was, didn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because Shelley\u0027s calling a marriage counselor.\" And now, Layla sighed. \"Because you play the damn guitar, and I know without counting that there\u0027s another dollar in that stupid jar even though Alice is gone, because you said fuck. Because Cal told Quinn you wouldn\u0027t press charges against Block.\"\\n\\n \"All of those sound like fairly good reasons to be pals,\" Fox considered. \"They don\u0027t sound like reasons to have sex.\"\\n\\n \"I can have any reasons I like to have sex with you,\" she said, just prissily enough to make him fight off a grin. \"Including the fact that you\u0027ve got a great ass, that you can look at me and make me feel like you\u0027ve already got your hands on me. And just because I want to. So I\u0027m going to have sex with you.\"\\n\\n \"As I said, this is excellent news. Hey, Sage, how\u0027s it going?\"\\n\\n \"Really good. Sorry to interrupt.\"\\n\\n With her stomach already sinking to her knees, Layla turned. The woman who stood in the doorway had a big O\u0027Dell grin on her face. Her hair was a short sweep of fiery red around a pretty face made compelling by a pair of golden brown eyes.\\n\\n \"Layla, this is my sister Sage. Sage, Layla.\"\\n\\n \"Nice to meet you.\" In snug jeans tucked into stylish boots, Sage stepped forward to offer a hand.\\n\\n \"Yes. Well. I\u0027m just going to go out to reception and beat my head against the wall for a few minutes. Excuse me.\"\\n\\n Sage watched her walk away, then turned back to her brother. \"Very nice package.\"\\n\\n \"Cut it out. It\u0027s too weird to have you checking out the same woman I am. Besides, you\u0027re married.\"\\n\\n \"Marriage doesn\u0027t pluck out the eyes. Hey.\" She spread her arms.\\n\\n He rose, walked into them, and banding her with his, lifted her off her feet for a quick swing. \"I thought I was meeting you at Sparrow\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"You are, but I wanted to drop by.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Paula?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s taking the meeting that gave us the excuse to come East. In D.C. She\u0027ll be up later. Let me look at you, Foxy Loxy.\"\\n\\n \"Looking back at you, Parsley Sage.\"\\n\\n \"Still enjoying small-town law?\"\\n\\n \"Still a lesbian?\"\\n\\n She laughed. \"Okay, enough of that. I guess I should come back later, when you\u0027re not having sex with your office manager.\"\\n\\n \"I think that\u0027s been postponed due to acute embarrassment.\"\\n\\n \"I hope I didn\u0027t screw it up.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll fix it. Mom said you weren\u0027t clear about how long you\u0027re staying.\"\\n\\n \"I guess we weren\u0027t. It sort of depends.\" She blew out a breath. \"It sort of depends on you.\"\\n\\n \"You and Paula want to practice small-town lesbian law, and want to go into partnership with me in the Hollow.\" He got them a couple of Cokes.\\n\\n \"No. Partnership might be a factor, depending on your definition.\"\\n\\n He handed her the Coke. \"What\u0027s up, Sage?\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re busy, we can talk about this tonight. Maybe have a drink.\"\\n\\n She was nervous, Fox noted, and Sage was rarely nervous. \"I\u0027ve got time.\"\\n\\n \"Well, the thing is, Fox.\" She tapped her fingers on the can as she wandered around the room. \"The thing is, Paula and I have decided to have a baby.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great. That\u0027s terrific. How do you guys do that? Do you call Rent-a-Penis? Sperm R Us?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be an ass.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, there are jokes here waiting to happen.\"\\n\\n \"Ha ha. We\u0027ve thought about it a lot, talked it through. We actually think we\u0027ll want a couple of kids. And we decided, for the first one, Paula will get pregnant. I\u0027ll, you know, take round two.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be great parents.\" Reaching out, he gave her hair a quick tug. \"The kids\u0027ll be lucky to have both of you.\"\\n\\n \"We want to be. We\u0027re sure as hell going to try to be. To take the first step, we need a donor.\" She turned back, faced him. \"We want it to be you.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, what? What?\" The Coke, fortunately not yet opened, slipped right out of his hands.\\n\\n \"I know it\u0027s big, and strange.\" Smoothly, she bent to retrieve his Coke and hand it to him while he simply goggled at her. \"And we won\u0027t hold it against you if you say no.\"\\n\\n \"Why? I mean, lame jokes aside, there are, like banks for this kind of thing. You can make a withdrawal.\"\\n\\n \"And there are very good places, where donors are very well screened, and you can select specific qualities. That\u0027s an option, but far from our first. You and I are the same blood, Fox, the same gene pool. The baby, the baby would be more ours because of that.\"\\n\\n \"Um, Ridge? He\u0027s already proven himself in this department.\"\\n\\n \"Which is one of the reasons I don\u0027t feel right asking him. And, while I love him like crazy, both Paula and I zeroed in on you. Our Ridge is a dreamer, an artist, a beautiful soul. You\u0027re a doer, Fox. You\u0027re always going to try to do the right thing, but you get things done. And you and I are closer personality-wise, physically, too. Same coloring.\" She tugged on her hair herself now. \"I went red, but under the dye, my hair\u0027s the same color as yours.\"\\n\\n He was, he realized, still stuck back on the term donor. \"I\u0027m a little weirded out here, Sage.\"\\n\\n \"I bet. I\u0027m going to ask you to think about it. Don\u0027t say yes or no yet because it\u0027s a lot to think about. After you do, if it\u0027s no, we\u0027ll understand. I haven\u0027t said anything to anyone else in the family, so there\u0027s no pressure there.\"\\n\\n \"Appreciate it. Listen, I\u0027m oddly flattered that you and Paula would, ah... want me to sub for you. I\u0027ll think about it.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\" She pressed her cheek to his. \"I\u0027ll see you at lunch.\"\\n\\n When she left he stared down at the Coke in his hand, then crossed over and put it back in his little fridge. He didn\u0027t think he needed any more stimulation. One thing at a time, he decided, and went out to Layla.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Your sister was very friendly, positively breezy. She behaved as if she hadn\u0027t heard me announce I was going to have sex with her brother.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s probably that natural act, celebration of human expression thing. And she had stuff on her mind.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a grown woman. I\u0027m a single, healthy adult.\" In a gesture that smacked of defiance, she shook back her hair. \"So I\u0027m telling myself there\u0027s absolutely no cause for me to be embarrassed because... Is something wrong?\"\\n\\n \"No. I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s been a really strange morning. It turns out...\" How did he put this? \"I told you my sister\u0027s gay, right?\"\\n\\n \"It was mentioned.\"\\n\\n \"She and Paula, they\u0027ve been together some years now. They\u0027re good together, really good together. And...\" He paced to the window, back. \"They want a baby.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s nice.\"\\n\\n \"They want me to provide the Y chromosome.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. Oh.\" Layla pursed her lips. \"I guess you have had a strange morning. What did you say?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember, exactly, with all the going blind and deaf. I\u0027m supposed to think about it. Which, of course, I\u0027d have a hard time not.\"\\n\\n \"They both must think a great deal of you. Since you didn\u0027t say no, straight off, you must think a great deal of them.\"\\n\\n \"Right this minute, I can\u0027t think at all. Can we close the office and go have sex?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I was afraid of that.\"\\n\\n \"Your last appointment is at four thirty. We can go have sex after that.\"\\n\\n He stared at her. \"It continues to be a really strange day.\"\\n\\n \"Your schedule on this strange day says that I\u0027m to make a conference call for you on the Benedict case. Here\u0027s the file.\"\\n\\n \"Go ahead on that. Do you want to come to lunch with me, over to Sparrow\u0027s with the family?\"\\n\\n \"Not for a million dollars.\"\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t blame her, all things considered. Still it was an easy hour for him with his brother and Ridge\u0027s wife and little boy, with his sisters, his parents, filling Sparrow\u0027s little restaurant.\\n\\n Layla went to lunch when he returned, and that gave him room to think. He tried not to watch the clock while he worked, but he\u0027d never, at any time in his life, wished quite so much for time to fly.\\n\\n Naturally, his last client of the day was chatty, and didn\u0027t seem the least bit concerned about billable hours, or the fact that it was now ten minutes after five. The price of small-town law, Fox thought as he fought the urge to check his watch, again. People wanted to shoot the breeze, before, during, and after business. Any other time, he\u0027d have been perfectly happy to kick back and talk about preseason baseball, the O\u0027s chances this year, and the rookie infielder who showed such potential.\\n\\n But he had a woman waiting, and his own engine was revving.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t precisely drag his client to the door and give him a boot to the sidewalk for good measure. But he didn\u0027t linger.\\n\\n \"I thought he\u0027d never shut up,\" Fox said as he locked the door behind him. \"We\u0027re closed. Shut down, don\u0027t answer the phone. And come with me.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, I was thinking maybe we should consider.\"\\n\\n \"No, no thinking, no considering. Don\u0027t make me beg.\" He solved the matter by grabbing her hand and pulling her toward the stairs. \"Marriage counseling, burning buildings, nice ass-in no particular order-just to refresh your memory.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t forgotten, I just-when did you clean?\" she asked when he drew her into the apartment.\\n\\n \"Yesterday. It was an ugly business, but fortuitous.\"\\n\\n \"In that case I have the name of a cleaning woman, Marcia Biggons.\"\\n\\n \"I went to school with her sister.\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027m told. She\u0027ll give you a chance. Call her.\"\\n\\n \"First thing tomorrow. Now.\" He leaned in, took her mouth while his hands skimmed down from her shoulders to her wrist. \"We\u0027re going to have some wine.\"\\n\\n Her eyes blinked open. \"Wine?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to put on some music, we\u0027re going to have some wine. We\u0027re going to sit down in my fairly clean living room and relax.\"\\n\\n She let out a breathless laugh. \"You\u0027ve just added one to the list of why I\u0027m here. I\u0027d love some wine, thanks.\"\\n\\n He opened the bottle of Shiraz a client had given him at Christmas, put on Clapton-it just seemed right-and poured two glasses.\\n\\n \"Your artwork shows off better without the mountain of clutter. Mmm, this is nice,\" she said after the first sip when he joined her on the couch. \"I wasn\u0027t sure what I\u0027d get, seeing as you\u0027re more of a beer guy.\"\\n\\n \"I have deep wells.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you do.\" And gorgeous, thick brown hair, wonderful tiger\u0027s eyes. \"I didn\u0027t get a chance to ask if you\u0027d read our notes, or the marked-\" She swallowed the rest of the words when his mouth met hers again.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s what we\u0027re not going to talk about. Office work and missions from gods. Tell me what you did in New York for fun.\"\\n\\n Okay, she thought, small talk would be good. She could talk small with the best of them. \"Clubs, because I like music. Galleries because I like art. But my job was fun, too. I guess it\u0027s always fun to do what you\u0027re good at.\"\\n\\n \"Your parents owned a dress shop.\"\\n\\n \"I loved working there, too. Well, playing there when I was a kid. All the colors and textures. I liked putting things together. This jacket with this skirt, this coat with this bag. We thought I\u0027d take over one day, but it just got to be too much for them.\"\\n\\n \"So you went to New York, left Philly behind.\"\\n\\n \"I thought I\u0027d go where fashion rules, on this side of the Atlantic anyway.\" The wine was lovely, just slid over her tongue. \"I\u0027d get some polish, some more experience in a more specialized arena, then open my own place.\"\\n\\n \"In New York?\"\\n\\n \"I flirted with that for about five minutes. I was never going to be able to afford the rent in the city. I thought maybe the suburbs, maybe one day. Then one day became next year, and so on. Plus I liked managing the boutique, and there wasn\u0027t any risk. I stopped taking risks.\"\\n\\n \"Until recently.\"\\n\\n She met his eyes. \"Apparently.\"\\n\\n He smiled, topped off their wine. \"The Hollow doesn\u0027t have a dress shop, or fashion boutique, or whatever you\u0027d call that kind of thing.\"\\n\\n \"At the moment, I\u0027m gainfully employed and no longer thinking about opening a boutique. My risk quota\u0027s been reached.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of music? Do you like to listen to?\" he added when she frowned at him.\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m pretty open there.\"\\n\\n He reached down, slipped off her shoes, then brought her feet up into his lap. \"How about art?\"\\n\\n \"There, too. I think...\" Her whole body sighed when he began rubbing the balls of her feet. \"Any art, or music, that gives you pleasure, or makes you think-or better makes you wonder; it\u0027s-it\u0027s what makes us human. The need to create it, to have it.\"\\n\\n \"I grew up soaked in it, various forms. Nothing was out-of-bounds.\" His thumb, just rough enough to thrill, ran down her arch, back again. \"Anything out-of-bounds for you?\"\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t talking about art or music now. Her stomach jittered with lust, fear, anticipation. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"You can tell me if I hit any boundaries.\" His hand went to work on her calf muscles. \"Tell me what you like.\"\\n\\n Flustered, she stared.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s okay. I\u0027ll figure it out. I like the shape of you. The high arch of your feet, the muscles in your calves.
