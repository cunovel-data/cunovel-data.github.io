But a night of pre-pubescent celebration turns into a night of horror as their blood brother oath unleashes a three-hundred year curse. \n Twenty-one years later, Fox O\u0027Dell and his friends have seen their town plagued by a week of unexplainable evil events two more times - every seven years. With the clock winding down on the third set of seven years, someone else has taken an interest in the town\u0027s folklore. \n A boutique manager from New York, Layla Darnell was drawn to Hawkins Hollow for reasons she can\u0027t explain - but the recent attacks on her life make it clear that it is personal. And though Fox tries to keep his professional distance, his interests in Layla have become personal too.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-hollow-sign-of-seven-2.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":21,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
