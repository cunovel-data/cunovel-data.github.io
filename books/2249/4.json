{"id":85799,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"IN THE DREAM IT WAS SUMMER. THE HEAT GRIPPED with sweaty hands, squeezing and wringing out energy like water out of a rag. In Hawkins Wood, leaves spread thick and green overhead, but the sun forced its way through in laser beams to flash into his eyes. Berries ripened on the thorny brambles, and the wild lilies bloomed in unearthly orange.\\n\\n He knew his way. It seemed Fox had always known his way through these trees, down these paths. His mother would have called it sensory memory, he thought. Or past-life flashes.\\n\\n He liked the quiet that was country woods-the low hum of insects, the faint rustle of squirrels or rabbits, the melodic chorus of birds with little more to do on a hot summer day but sing and wing.\\n\\n Yes, he knew his way here, knew the sounds here, knew even the feel of the air in every season, for he had walked here in every season. Melting summers, burgeoning springs, brisk autumns, brutal winters. So he recognized the chill in the air when it crawled up his spine, and the sudden change of light, the gray tinge that wasn\u0027t the simplicity of a stray cloud over the sun. He knew the soft growl that came from behind, from in front, and choked off the music of the chickadees and jays.\\n\\n He continued to walk the path to Hester\u0027s Pool.\\n\\n Fear walked with him. It trickled along his skin like sweat, urged him to run. He had no weapon, and in the dream didn\u0027t question why he would come here alone, unarmed. When the trees-denuded now-began to bleed, he kept on. The blood was a lie; the blood was fear.\\n\\n He stopped only when he saw the woman. She stood at the small dark pond, her back to him. She bent, gathering stones, filling her pockets with them.\\n\\n Hester. Hester Deale. In the dream he called out to her, though he knew she was doomed. He couldn\u0027t go back hundreds of years and stop her from drowning herself. Nor could he stop himself from trying.\\n\\n So he called out to her as he hurried forward, as the growling turned to a wet snicker of horrible amusement.\\n\\n Don\u0027t. Don\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t your fault. None of it was your fault.\\n\\n When she turned, when she looked into his eyes, it wasn\u0027t Hester, but Layla. Tears streaked her face like bitter rain, and her face was white as bone.\\n\\n I can\u0027t stop. I don\u0027t want to die. Help me. Can\u0027t you help me?\\n\\n Now he began to run, to run toward her, but the path stretched longer and longer, the snickering grew louder and louder. She held out her hands to him, a final plea before she fell into the pool, and vanished.\\n\\n He leaped. The water was viciously, brutally cold. He dove down, searching until his burning lungs sent him up to gulp in air. A storm raged in the woods now, wild red lightning, cracking thunder, sparking fires that engulfed entire trees. He dove again, calling for Layla with his mind.\\n\\n When he saw her, he plunged deeper.\\n\\n Once again their eyes met, once again she reached for him.\\n\\n She embraced him. Her mouth took his in a kiss that was as cold as the water. And she dragged him down to drown.\\n\\n HE WOKE GASPING FOR AIR, HIS THROAT RAW AND burning. His chest pounded with pain as he fumbled for the light, as he shoved up and over to sit on the side of the bed and catch his laboring breath.\\n\\n Not in the woods, not in the pond, he told himself, but in his own bed, in his own apartment. As he pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes he reminded himself he should be used to the nightmares. He and Cal and Gage had been plagued by them every seven years since they\u0027d turned ten. He should be used, too, to pulling aspects of the dream back with him.\\n\\n He was still chilled, his skin shivering spasmodically over frigid bones. The iron taste of the pool\u0027s water still coated his throat. Not real, he thought. No more real than bleeding trees or fires that didn\u0027t burn. Just another nasty jab by a demon from hell. No permanent damage.\\n\\n He rose, left the bedroom, crossed his living room, and went into the kitchen. He pulled a cold bottle of water out of the fridge and drank half of it down as he stood.\\n\\n When the phone rang, he felt a fresh spurt of alarm. Layla\u0027s number was displayed on the caller ID. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re okay.\" Her breath came out in a long, jerky whoosh. \"You\u0027re okay.\"\\n\\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t I be?\"\\n\\n \"I... God, it\u0027s three in the morning. I\u0027m sorry. Panic attack. I woke you up. Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t wake me up. Why wouldn\u0027t I be okay, Layla?\"\\n\\n \"It was just a dream. I shouldn\u0027t have called you.\"\\n\\n \"We were at Hester\u0027s Pool.\"\\n\\n There was a moment of silence. \"I killed you.\"\\n\\n \"As attorney for the defense, I have to advise that\u0027s going to be a hard case to prosecute, as the victim is currently alive and well and standing in his own kitchen.\"\\n\\n \"Fox-\"\\n\\n \"It was a dream. A bad one, but still a dream. He\u0027s playing on your weakness, Layla.\" And mine, Fox realized, because I want to save the girl. \"I can come over. We\u0027ll-\"\\n\\n \"No, no, I feel stupid enough calling you. It was just so real, you know?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I do.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t think, I just grabbed the phone. All right, calmer now. We\u0027ll need to talk about this tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"We will. Try to get some sleep.\"\\n\\n \"You, too. And Fox, I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t drown you in Hester\u0027s Pool.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m pretty happy about that myself. Good night.\"\\n\\n Fox carried the bottle of water back to the bedroom. There, he stood looking out the window that faced the street. The Hollow was quiet, and still as a photograph. Nothing stirred. The people he loved, the people he knew, were safe in their beds.\\n\\n But he stood there, watchful in the dark, and thought about a kiss that had been cold as the grave. And still seductive.\\n\\n \"CAN YOU REMEMBER ANY OTHER DETAILS?\" CYBIL wrote notes on Layla\u0027s dream as Layla finished off her coffee.\\n\\n \"I think I gave you everything.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" Cybil leaned back in the kitchen chair, tapped her pencil. \"The way it sounds, you and Fox had the same dream. It\u0027ll be interesting to see if they were exact, or how the details vary.\"\\n\\n \"Interesting.\"\\n\\n \"And informative. You could\u0027ve woke me, Layla. We all know what it\u0027s like to have these nightmares.\"\\n\\n \"I felt steadier after I\u0027d spoken to Fox, and he wasn\u0027t dead.\" She managed a small smile. \"Plus, I don\u0027t need to be shrink-wrapped to figure out that part of the dream was rooted in what we talked about last night. My fear of hurting one of you.\"\\n\\n \"Especially Fox.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe especially. I\u0027m working for him, for now. And I need to work with him. You and I and Quinn, we\u0027re, well, fish in the same pool. I\u0027m not as worried about the two of you. You\u0027ll tell Quinn about the dream.\"\\n\\n \"As soon as she\u0027s back from her workout. Since I assume she dragged Cal to the gym with her, she\u0027ll probably talk him into coming back here for coffee. I can tell them both, and someone will fill Gage in. Gage was a little rough on you last night.\"\\n\\n \"He was.\"\\n\\n \"You needed it.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I did.\" No point in whining about it, Layla thought. \"Let me ask you something. You and Gage are going to have to work together, too, at some point. How\u0027s that going to work?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll cross that bridge when. And I think we\u0027ll figure out a way to handle it without shedding each other\u0027s blood.\"\\n\\n \"If you say so. I\u0027m going to go up and get dressed, get to work.\"\\n\\n \"Do you want a ride in?\"\\n\\n \"No, thanks. The walk\u0027ll do me good.\"\\n\\n Layla took her time. Alice Hawbaker would be manning the office, and there would be little to do. With Alice there, Layla didn\u0027t think it would be wise to huddle with Fox over a shared dream. Nor would it be the best time to have a lesson on honing and, more important to her, controlling her ability.\\n\\n She\u0027d handle busywork for a couple of hours, run whatever errands Alice might have on tap. It had taken her only a few days to understand the rhythm of the office. If she had any interest or aspirations toward managing a law office, Fox\u0027s practice would have been just fine.\\n\\n As it was, it would bore her senseless within weeks.\\n\\n Which wasn\u0027t the point, Layla reminded herself as she deliberately headed to the Square. The point was to help Fox, to earn a paycheck, and to keep busy.\\n\\n She stopped at the Square. And that was another point. She could stand here, she thought, she could look at the broken or boarded windows straight-on. She could tell herself to face what had happened to her the evening before, promise herself she would do all she could to stop it.\\n\\n She turned, started down Main Street to cover the few blocks to Fox\u0027s office.\\n\\n It was a nice town if you just overlooked what happened to it, in it, every seven years. There were lovely old houses along Main, pretty little shops. It was busy in the way small towns were busy. Steady, with familiar faces running the errands and making the change at the cash registers. There was a comfort in that, she supposed.\\n\\n She liked the wide porches, the awnings, the tidy front yards and bricked sidewalks. It was a pleasant, quaint place, at least on the surface, and not quite postcardy enough to make it annoying.\\n\\n The town\u0027s rhythm was another she\u0027d tuned to quickly. People walked here, stopped to have a word with a neighbor or a friend. If she crossed the street to Ma\u0027s Pantry, she\u0027d be greeted by name, asked how she was doing.\\n\\n Halfway down the block she stopped in front of the little gift shop where she\u0027d picked up some odds and ends for the house. The owner stood out front, staring up at her broken windows. When she turned, Layla saw the tears.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\" Layla walked to her. \"Is there something-\"\\n\\n The woman shook her head. \"It\u0027s just glass, isn\u0027t it? Just glass and things. A lot of broken things. A couple of those damn birds got through, wrecked half my stock. It was like they wanted to, like they were drunks at a party. I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\\n\\n \"I tell myself, well, you\u0027ve got insurance. And Mr. Hawkins\u0027ll fix the windows. He\u0027s a good landlord, and those windows will be fixed right away. But it doesn\u0027t seem to matter.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d be heartbroken, too,\" Layla told her, and laid a hand on her arm for comfort. \"You had really pretty things.\"\\n\\n \"Broken now. Seven years back a bunch of kids-we think-busted in and tore the place up. Broke everything they could, wrote obscenities on the walls. It was hard coming back from that, but we did it. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve got the heart to do it again. I don\u0027t know if I have the heart.\" The woman walked back to her shop, went inside behind the broken glass.\\n\\n Not just broken glass and broken things, Layla thought as she walked on. Broken dreams, too. One vicious act could shatter so much.\\n\\n Her own heart was heavy when she walked into the reception area. Mrs. Hawbaker sat at the desk, fingers clicking away at the keyboard. \"Morning!\" She stopped and gave Layla a smile. \"Don\u0027t you look nice.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\" Layla slipped off her jacket, hung it in the foyer closet. \"A friend of mine in New York packed up my clothes, shipped them down for me. Can I get you some coffee, or is there anything you want me to get started on?\"\\n\\n \"Fox said to ask you to go on back when you got in. He\u0027s got about thirty minutes before an appointment, so you go ahead.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be leaving at one today. Be sure to remind Fox he\u0027s in court in the morning. It\u0027s on his calendar, and I sent him a memo, but it\u0027s best to remind him at the end of the day, too.\"\\n\\n \"No problem.\"\\n\\n From her observations, Layla thought as she walked down the hall, Fox wasn\u0027t nearly as forgetful or absent-minded as he and Alice liked to think. Since the pocket doors to his office were open, she started to knock on the edge as she entered. Then she just stopped and stared.\\n\\n He stood in back of his desk in front of the window in his no-court-today jeans and untucked shirt, juggling three red balls. His legs were spread, his face absolutely relaxed, and those tiger eyes of his following the circle as his hands caught and tossed, caught and tossed.\\n\\n \"You can juggle.\"\\n\\n She broke his rhythm, but he managed to catch two balls in one hand, one in the other before they went flying around the room. \"Yeah. It helps me think.\"\\n\\n \"You can juggle,\" she repeated, dazed and delighted.\\n\\n Because it was rare to see her smile just that way, he sent the balls circling again. \"It\u0027s all timing.\" When she laughed, he shot them high, began to walk and turn as he tossed the balls. \"Three objects, even four, same size and weight, not really a challenge. If I\u0027m looking for a challenge I mix it up. This is just think juggling.\"\\n\\n \"Think juggling,\" she repeated as he caught the balls again.\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" He opened his desk drawer, dropped them in. \"Helps clear my head when I\u0027m...\" He got a good look at her. \"Wow. You look... good.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\" She\u0027d worn a skirt and a short, cinched jacket and now wondered if it was too upscale for her current position. \"I got the rest of my clothes, and I thought since I had them... Anyway, you wanted to see me.\"\\n\\n \"I did? I did,\" he remembered. \"Wait.\" He crossed to the doors, slid them closed. \"Do you want anything?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" His juggling-clear head was fogged up again thanks to her legs, so he went to his minifridge and took out a Coke. \"I thought, since there\u0027s some time this morning, we should compare notes about the dream. Let\u0027s sit down.\"\\n\\n She took one of the visitors\u0027 chairs, and Fox took the other. \"You go first,\" she told him.\\n\\n When he\u0027d finished, he got up, opened his little fridge, and took out a bottle of Diet Pepsi. When he put it into her hand and she just stared at it, he sat again. \"That\u0027s what you drink, right? That\u0027s what\u0027s stocked in the fridge at your place.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Do you want a glass?\"\\n\\n She shook her head. The simple consideration shouldn\u0027t have surprised her, and yet it did. \"Do you keep Diet Sprite in there for Alice?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Why not,\" she murmured, then drank. \"I was in the woods, too,\" Layla began. \"But it wasn\u0027t just me. She was in my head, or I was in hers. It\u0027s hard to tell. I felt her despair, her fear, like they were mine. I... I\u0027ve never been pregnant, never had a child, but my body felt different.\" She hesitated, then told herself she\u0027d been able to give Cybil the details. She could give them to Fox. \"My breasts were heavy, and I understood, I knew, I\u0027d nursed. In the same way I\u0027d experienced her rape. It was that same kind of awareness. I knew where I was going.\"\\n\\n She paused again, shifted so she could look at his face. He had a way of listening, she thought, so that she knew he not only heard every word, but also understood what came behind them. \"I don\u0027t know those woods, have only been in them that one time, but I knew where I was, and I knew I was going to the pond. I knew why. I didn\u0027t want to go. I didn\u0027t want to go there, but I couldn\u0027t stop myself. I couldn\u0027t stop her. I was screaming inside because I didn\u0027t want to die, but she did. She couldn\u0027t stand it anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t stand what?\"\\n\\n \"She remembered. She remembered the rape, how it felt, what was in her. She remembered, Fox, the night in the clearing. He-it-controlled her so that she accused Giles Dent of her rape, denounced him and Ann Hawkins as witches, and she assumed they were dead. She couldn\u0027t live with the guilt. He told her to run.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"Dent. In the clearing, just before the fire, he looked at her-he pitied her, he forgave her. He told her to run. She ran. She was only sixteen. Everyone thought the child was Dent\u0027s, and pitied her for that. She knew, but was afraid to recant. Afraid to speak.\"\\n\\n It pierced her as she spoke of it. That fear, that horror and despair. \"She was afraid all the time, Fox, and mad with that fear, that guilt, those memories by the time she delivered the child. I felt it all, it was all swimming inside her-and me. She wanted to end it. She wanted to take the child with her, and end that, too, but she couldn\u0027t bring herself to do it.\"\\n\\n Those alert and compassionate eyes narrowed on Layla\u0027s face. \"She thought about killing the baby?\"\\n\\n As she nodded, Layla drew air in slowly. \"She feared it, and hated it, and still she loved it. It, not she. I mean-\"\\n\\n \"Hester thought of the baby as \u0027it.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Yes. Yes. But still, she couldn\u0027t kill the baby. If she had-I thought, when I understood that, if she had, I wouldn\u0027t be here. She gave me life by sparing the child, and now she was going to kill me because I was trapped with her. We walked, and if she heard me she must\u0027ve thought I was one of the voices driving her mad. I couldn\u0027t make her listen, couldn\u0027t make her understand. Then I saw you.\"\\n\\n She paused to drink again, to steady herself. \"I saw you, and I thought, Thank God. Thank God, he\u0027s here. I could feel the stones in my hand when she picked them up, feel the weight of them dragging down the pockets of the dress we wore. There was nothing I could do, but I thought-\"\\n\\n \"You thought I\u0027d stop her.\" So had he, Fox mused. Save the girl.\\n\\n \"You were calling out, telling her it wasn\u0027t her fault. You ran to her-to me. And for an instant, I think she heard you. I think, I felt, she wanted to believe you. Then we were in the water, going down. I couldn\u0027t tell if she fell or jumped, but we were under the water. I told myself not to panic. Don\u0027t panic. I\u0027m a good swimmer.\"\\n\\n \"Captain of the swim team.\"\\n\\n \"I told you that?\" She managed a small laugh, wet her throat again. \"I told myself I could get to the surface, even with the weight, I\u0027m a strong swimmer. But I couldn\u0027t. Worse, I couldn\u0027t even try. It wasn\u0027t just the stones weighing me down.\"\\n\\n \"It was Hester.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I saw you in the water, diving down, and then...\" She closed her eyes, pressed her lips hard together.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay.\" Reaching over, he closed a hand over hers. \"We\u0027re okay.\"\\n\\n \"Fox, I don\u0027t know if it was her, or if I... I don\u0027t know. We grabbed on to you.\"\\n\\n \"You kissed me.\"\\n\\n \"We killed you.\"\\n\\n \"We all came to a bad end, but it didn\u0027t actually happen. However vivid and sensory, it wasn\u0027t real. It was a hard way for you to get inside Hester Deale\u0027s head, but now we know more about her.\"\\n\\n \"Why were you there?\"\\n\\n \"Best guess? We\u0027ve got this link, you and me. I\u0027ve shared dreams with Cal and Gage before. Same thing. But there was more this time, another level of connection. In the dream, I saw you, Layla. Not Hester. I heard you. That\u0027s interesting. Something to think about.\"\\n\\n \"When you juggle.\"\\n\\n He grinned. \"Couldn\u0027t hurt. We need to-\"\\n\\n His intercom buzzed. \"Mr. Edwards is here.\"\\n\\n Fox rose, flipped the switch on his desk. \"Okay, give me a minute.\" He turned back to Layla as she rose. \"We need some more time on this. My last appointment today\u0027s at-\"\\n\\n \"Four. Mrs. Halliday.\"\\n\\n \"Right. You\u0027re good. If you\u0027re not booked, we could go upstairs after my last appointment, do some work on this.\"\\n\\n It was time, Layla thought, to suit up. \"All right.\"\\n\\n He walked to the doors with her, slid them open. \"We could have some dinner,\" he began.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want you to go to any trouble.\"\\n\\n \"I have every delivery place within a five-mile radius on speed dial.\"\\n\\n She smiled a little. \"Good plan.\"\\n\\n He walked out with her to where two hundred and twenty pounds of Edwards filled a chair in reception. His belly, covered in a white T-shirt, pillowed over the waistband of his jeans. His scrubby gray hair was topped by a John Deere gimme cap. He pushed to his feet, held out a hand to clasp the one Fox offered.\\n\\n \"How you doing?\" Fox asked.\\n\\n \"You tell me.\"\\n\\n \"Come on back, Mr. Edwards. We\u0027ll talk about it.\"\\n\\n Works outside, Layla decided as Fox led his client back. A farmer maybe, or a builder, a landscaper. A couple clicks over sixty, and discouraged.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s his story, Alice? Can you tell me?\"\\n\\n \"Property dispute,\" Alice said as she gathered up envelopes. \"Tim Edwards has a farm a few miles south of town. Developers bought some of the land that runs with it. Survey puts some eight acres of Tim\u0027s land over the line. Developer wants it, so does Tim. I\u0027m going to run to the post office.\"\\n\\n \"I can do that.\"\\n\\n Alice wagged a finger. \"Then I wouldn\u0027t get the walk or the gossip. I\u0027ve got notes here on a trust Fox is putting together. Why don\u0027t you draft that out while I\u0027m gone?\"\\n\\n Alone, Layla sat, got to work. Within ten minutes, she wondered why people needed such complicated, convoluted language to say the straightforward. She picked her way through it, answered the phone, made appointments. When Alice came back, she had questions. She noted that Edwards walked out looking considerably less discouraged.\\n\\n By one o\u0027clock, she was on her own and pleased to print out the trust Alice had proofed for her. By page two, the printer signaled its cartridge was out of ink. She went to the supply closet across from the pretty little law library hoping Fox stocked backups. She spotted the box on the top shelf.\\n\\n Why was it always the top shelf? she wondered. Why were there top shelves anyway when not everyone in the world was six feet tall? She rose to her toes, stretched up and managed to nudge a corner of the carton over the edge of the shelf. With one hand braced on a lower shelf, she wiggled it out another inch.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going out to grab some lunch,\" Fox said from behind her. \"If you want anything- Here, let me get that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve almost got the damn thing now.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, and it\u0027s going to fall on your head.\"\\n\\n He leaned in, reached up, just as she turned.\\n\\n Their bodies brushed, bumped. Her face tipped up, filled his vision as her scent slid around him like satin ribbons. Those sea-siren eyes made him feel a little drunk and a lot needy. He thought: Step back, O\u0027Dell. Then he made the mistake of letting his gaze drop down to her mouth. And he was done.\\n\\n He angled down, another inch, heard her breath draw in. Her lips parted, and he closed that last whisper of distance. A small, soft taste, then another, both feather light. Then her lashes swept down over those seductive eyes; her mouth brushed his.\\n\\n The kiss went deeper, a slow slide into heat that tangled his senses, that filled them with her until all he wanted was to sink and sink and sink. And drown.\\n\\n She made some sound, pleasure, distress, he couldn\u0027t tell with the blood roaring in his ears. But it reminded him where they were. How they were. He broke the kiss, realized he was essentially shoving her into the storage closet.\\n\\n \"Sorry. I\u0027m sorry.\" She was working for him, for God\u0027s sake. \"I shouldn\u0027t have. That was inappropriate. It was-\" Amazing. \"It was...\"\\n\\n \"Fox?\"\\n\\n He jerked back an entire foot at the voice behind him. When he whirled around, he could feel his stomach drop straight to his knees. \"Mom.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry to interrupt.\" She gave Fox a sunny smile, then turned it on Layla. \"Hi. I\u0027m Joanne Barry. Fox\u0027s mother.\"\\n\\n Why was there never a handy hole in the floor when you needed one? Layla thought. \"It\u0027s nice to meet you, Ms. Barry. I\u0027m Layla Darnell.\"\\n\\n \"I told you Layla\u0027s helping me out in the office. We were just...\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you were.\"\\n\\n Still smiling, she left it at that.\\n\\n She was the kind of woman you\u0027d probably stare at even if you weren\u0027t stunned stupid, Layla thought. There was all that rich brown hair waving wild around a strong-boned face with its full, unpainted mouth, and long hazel eyes that managed to look amused, curious, and patient all at once. Joanne had the tall, willowy build that carried the low-slung jeans, boots, and skinny sweater look perfectly.\\n\\n Since it appeared Fox had been struck dumb, Layla managed to clear her throat. \"I, ah, needed a new cartridge. For the printer? It\u0027s on the top shelf.\"\\n\\n \"Right. Right. I was getting that.\" Fox turned, managed to collide with Layla again. \"Sorry.\" Jesus Christ. He\u0027d no more than pulled the box down when Layla snatched it away, and fled.\\n\\n \"Thanks!\"\\n\\n \"Do you have a minute for me?\" Jo asked sweetly. \"Or do you need to get back to what you were doing when I came in?\"\\n\\n \"Cut it out.\" Fox hunched his shoulders, led the way back to his office.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s very pretty. Who could blame you for playing a little boss and secretary?\"\\n\\n \"Mom.\" Now he dragged his hands through his hair. \"It wasn\u0027t like that. It was... Never mind.\" He dropped into a chair. \"What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"I had some things to do in town. One of which was to drop by your sister\u0027s for lunch. Sparrow tells me she hasn\u0027t seen you in there for two weeks.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been meaning to.\"\\n\\n Jo leaned back against his desk. \"Eating something that isn\u0027t fried, processed, and full of chemicals once a week won\u0027t kill you, Fox. And you should be supporting your sister.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. I\u0027ll go in today.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Second, I had some pottery to take into Lorrie\u0027s. You must\u0027ve seen what happened to her shop.\"\\n\\n \"Not specifically.\" He thought of the smashed windows, the corpses of crows on Main Street. \"How bad\u0027s the damage?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s bad.\" Jo lifted a hand to the trio of crystals that hung from a chain around her neck. \"Fox, she\u0027s talking about closing. Moving away. It breaks my heart. And it scares me. I\u0027m scared for you.\"\\n\\n He rose, put his arms around her, rubbed his cheek against hers. \"It\u0027s going to be okay. We\u0027re working on it.\"\\n\\n \"I want to do something. Your dad and I, all of us, we want to do something.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve done something every day of my entire life.\" He gave her a squeeze. \"You\u0027ve been my mom.\"\\n\\n She eased back to take his face in her hands. \"You get that charm from your father. Look right at me and reassure me it\u0027s going to be okay.\"\\n\\n Without hesitation or guile, his eyes met hers. \"It\u0027s going to be okay. Trust me.\"\\n\\n \"I do.\" She kissed his forehead, his cheek, then the other, then gave him a light peck on the lips. \"But you\u0027re still my baby. I expect you to take good care of my baby. Now go have lunch at your sister\u0027s. Her eggplant salad\u0027s on special today.\"\\n\\n \"Yummy.\"\\n\\n Tolerant, she gave him a light poke in the belly. \"You ought to close the office for an hour and take that pretty girl to lunch with you.\"\\n\\n \"The pretty girl works for me.\"\\n\\n \"How did I manage to raise such a rule follower? It\u0027s disheartening.\" She gave him another poke before starting for the door. \"I love you, Fox.\"\\n\\n \"I love you, Mom. And I\u0027ll walk out with you,\" he added quickly, realizing his mother would have no compunction about stopping by Layla\u0027s desk and pumping the pretty girl for information.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have another chance to get her alone and grill her,\" Jo said casually.\\n\\n \"Yeah. But not today.\"\\n\\n THE SALAD WASN\u0027T BAD, AND SINCE HE\u0027D EATEN at the counter he\u0027d had a little time to hang with his baby sister. Since she never failed to put him in a good mood, he walked back to his office appreciating the sunny, blustery day. He\u0027d have appreciated it more if he hadn\u0027t run into Derrick Napper, his childhood nemesis, as the now Deputy Napper came out of the barbershop.\\n\\n \"Well, hell, it\u0027s O\u0027Dell.\" Napper slipped on his dark glasses, looked up, then down the street. \"Funny, I don\u0027t see any ambulances to chase.\"\\n\\n \"Did you get that buzz cut on the town nickel? Somebody overpaid.\"\\n\\n Napper\u0027s smile spread thin on his tough, square face. \"I heard you were at the scene yesterday when there was trouble at the Square. Didn\u0027t stand by and give a statement, or come in to file a witness report. Being the town shyster, you ought to know better.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d be wrong on that, nothing new there. I stopped by and spoke to the chief this morning. I guess he doesn\u0027t tell his bootlickers everything.\"\\n\\n \"You ought to remember how many times my boot kicked your ass in the past, O\u0027Dell.\"\\n\\n \"I remember a lot of things.\" Fox walked by. Once a bully, he thought, always an asshole. Before the Seven was over, he imagined he and Napper would tangle again. But for now, he put it out of his mind.\\n\\n He had work to do, and as he opened the door of his office, admitted he had a road to smooth out. Might as well get it done.\\n\\n As he came in, Layla walked toward reception holding a vase of the flowers Alice Hawbaker liked having in the offices. Layla stopped dead.\\n\\n \"I was just giving these fresh water. There weren\u0027t any calls while you were gone, but I finished the trust and printed it out. It\u0027s on your desk.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Listen, Layla-\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t sure if there was anything to type up regarding Mr. Edwards, or-\"\\n\\n \"Okay, okay, put those down.\" He settled it by taking the vase out of her hands and setting it on a table.\\n\\n \"They actually go over-\"\\n\\n \"Stop. I was out of line, and I apologize.\"\\n\\n \"You already did.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m apologizing again. I don\u0027t want you to feel weirded out because in the office we\u0027ve got the employer-employee thing going on, and I made a move on you. I didn\u0027t intend... Your mouth was just there.\"\\n\\n \"My mouth was just there?\" Her tone changed from flustered to dangerously sweet. \"As in on my face, under my nose, and above my chin?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" He rubbed his fingers in the center of his forehead. \"Yes, but no. Your mouth was... I forgot not to do what I did, which was completely inappropriate under the circumstances. And I\u0027m going to start pleading the Fifth in a minute, or maybe just temporary insanity.\"\\n\\n \"You can plead whatever you want, but you may want to consider that my mouth, which was just there, wasn\u0027t forming words like no, or stop, or get the hell away from me. Which it\u0027s perfectly capable of doing.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" He said nothing for a moment. \"This is very awkward.\"\\n\\n \"Before or after we add your mother into it?\"\\n\\n \"That moves it from awkward to farce.\" He slipped his hands into his pockets. \"Should I assume you\u0027re not going to engage counsel and sue me for sexual harassment?\"\\n\\n She angled her head. \"Should I assume you\u0027re not going to fire me?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m voting yes to both questions. So we\u0027re good here?\"\\n\\n \"Dandy.\"\\n\\n She picked up the vase and carried it to the right table. \"By the way, I ordered another replacement cartridge for the printer.\" She slid a glance his way, lips just curved.\\n\\n \"Good thinking. I\u0027ll be-\" He gestured toward his office.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027ll be-\" She pointed to her desk.\\n\\n \"Okay.\" He started back. \"Okay,\" he repeated, then looked at the supply closet. \"Oh boy.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hollow-sign-of-seven-2/page-4.html","bookId":2249,"book":{"id":2249,"title":"The Hollow (Sign of Seven #2)","description":"Storyline: The Hollow (Sign of Seven #2) \\n In the small village of Hawkins Hollow, three best friends who share the same birthday sneak off into the woods for a sleepover the evening before turning 10.
