{"id":85803,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"FOX\u0027S FRIDAY SCHEDULE DIDN\u0027T GIVE HIM MUCH time to think, or to brood. He went from appointment to meeting, back to appointment and into phone conference. At midafternoon, he saw a clear hour and decided to use it to take a walk around town to give his brain a rest.\\n\\n Better yet, he thought, he\u0027d walk up to the Bowl-a-Rama, grab a few minutes with Cal. He\u0027d get a better sense of how Quinn was doing, how they were all doing if he talked with Cal.\\n\\n When he stepped into reception to tell Layla, he found her talking with Cal\u0027s great-grandmother Estelle Hawkins.\\n\\n \"I thought we were meeting at our usual clandestine rendezvous.\" He walked over to kiss her soft, thin-skinned cheek. \"How are we going to keep our secret affair secret?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all over town.\" Essie\u0027s eyes twinkled through the thick lenses of her glasses. \"We might as well start living in sin openly.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go up and pack.\"\\n\\n She laughed, swatted at him. \"Before you do, I was hoping you\u0027d have a few minutes for me. Professionally.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve always got time for you, in any way. Come on back. Layla\u0027s going to hold my calls.\" He winked at her as he took Essie\u0027s arm. \"In case our passions overwhelm us.\"\\n\\n \"Should I just lock the outside door?\" Layla called out as he led Essie away.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a wonder you can keep your mind on your work,\" Essie told him as they moved into his office, \"with a pretty girl like that around.\"\\n\\n \"I have Herculean power of will. Want a Coke?\"\\n\\n \"You know, I believe I would.\"\\n\\n \"Two seconds.\"\\n\\n He got a glass, ice, poured. She was one of Fox\u0027s favorite people, and he made sure she was comfortable before he sat with her in the sitting area of his office. \"Where\u0027s Ginger?\" he asked, referring to Cal\u0027s cousin who lived with Essie.\\n\\n \"She went on to the bank before it closes. She\u0027ll be coming back for me. This won\u0027t take long.\"\\n\\n \"What can I do for you? Want to sue somebody?\"\\n\\n She smiled at him. \"Can\u0027t think of anything I\u0027d like less. I wonder why people are forever suing each other.\"\\n\\n \"Blame the lawyers. Still, it\u0027s a better alternative than beating the hell out of each other. Mostly.\"\\n\\n \"People do that, too. But I\u0027m not here for either. It\u0027s about my will, Fox.\"\\n\\n It gave him a little pang. She was ninety-three, and he certainly understood and appreciated the value of having your affairs well in order long before you approached Essie\u0027s age. But it still gave him a little pang to think of his world without her in it.\\n\\n \"I updated your will and your trust a few years ago. Do you want changes?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing big. I have a couple pieces of jewelry I wanted to earmark for Quinn. Right now, my pearls and my aquamarine earrings are going to Frannie. She understands I want to leave them to her future daughter-in-law. I\u0027ve talked to her about it. And I know I can leave it like that, I can trust her to give them to Quinn. But, as I recall, you told me it\u0027s easier on those left behind if everything\u0027s spelled out.\"\\n\\n \"It generally is. I can take care of that for you.\" Though he trusted his memory when it came to Essie\u0027s business, Fox rose to get a legal pad and note it all down. \"It won\u0027t take long to draft the change. I can bring it by for your signature on Monday if that works for you.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just fine, but I don\u0027t mind coming in.\"\\n\\n He knew she continued to go into the library nearly every day, but if he could save her a trip he\u0027d rather. \"Tell you what, when it\u0027s ready, I\u0027ll give you a call. Then we\u0027ll see which way it works best. Is there anything else you want to change, add, take out?\"\\n\\n \"No, just those two pieces. You have everything spelled out so clearly. It gives me peace of mind, Fox.\"\\n\\n \"And if any of my grandchildren turn out to be lawyers, they can handle it for you.\"\\n\\n Her lips curved, but her eyes stayed somber as she reached out to pat his hand. \"I\u0027d like to live to see Cal married next fall. I\u0027d like to live through this next Seven and dance with my boy at his wedding.\"\\n\\n \"Miss Essie-\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t mind dancing with you at yours. And I can be greedy and say I\u0027d like to hold Cal\u0027s firstborn in my arms. But I know that may not be. What\u0027s coming this time is worse than all the rest.\"\\n\\n \"We won\u0027t let anything happen to you.\"\\n\\n She let out a sigh that was full of affection. \"You\u0027ve seen to this town since you were ten years old. You and Cal and Gage. I\u0027d like to live to see the day you didn\u0027t have to see to it. I\u0027m holding out for that.\" She gave his hand another pat. \"Now I expect Ginger will be coming along to fetch me.\"\\n\\n He rose to help her to her feet. \"I\u0027ll walk you out, wait for her.\"\\n\\n \"You just go about your business. I hope you\u0027ve got something fun planned for the weekend.\"\\n\\n \"I would if you\u0027d go out with me.\"\\n\\n She laughed, leaning on his arm as he walked her out. \"There was a day.\"\\n\\n He stood at the window, watching as Ginger eased Essie into the car.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s a remarkable woman,\" Layla commented.\\n\\n \"Yeah, she\u0027s something. I need you to pull her estate file. She wants a couple of changes.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"Do you ever think we\u0027ll lose this? That we\u0027ll lose the town, ourselves, the whole damn ball?\"\\n\\n She hesitated. \"Don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" He glanced back at her. \"No, I know we\u0027ll win this. But we won\u0027t all make it. Not everyone who\u0027s out there going about their business today is going to come through it.\"\\n\\n Instead of taking his walk, Fox went back into his office. He took a copy of his own will out of the desk drawer to review it.\\n\\n JUST AFTER FIVE HE WALKED HIS LAST CLIENT TO the door, then turned to Layla. \"We\u0027re out of here. Grab your things. We\u0027re going bowling.\"\\n\\n \"I really don\u0027t think so, but that\u0027s a nice thought. I want to check in with Quinn.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s meeting us there. The whole gang\u0027s hitting the Bowl-a-Rama. It\u0027s Friday night. Pizza, beer, and duckpins.\"\\n\\n She thought of the quiet meal of soup she\u0027d planned, a glass of wine and a book. \"You like to bowl.\"\\n\\n \"I hate it, which is problematic seeing as one of my closest friends owns a bowling alley.\" He got her coat as he spoke. \"But the pizza\u0027s good, and there are pinball machines. I love me some pinball. Regardless, we earned a break. From everything.\"\\n\\n \"I guess we did.\"\\n\\n He held out her coat. \"Friday night in the Hollow? The Bowl-a-Rama\u0027s the place to be.\"\\n\\n She smiled. \"Then I guess we\u0027d better get there. Can we walk?\"\\n\\n \"Read my mind. Figuratively speaking. I\u0027ve been antsy all day.\" He paused after they\u0027d stepped outside. \"Pansies in the tub outside the Flower Pot and see there? That\u0027s Eric Moore, clean-shaven. He shaves off his winter beard every March. Spring\u0027s coming.\"\\n\\n He took her hand as they hit the sidewalk. \"Do you know what I love as much as pinball and pizza?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Taking a walk with a pretty girl.\"\\n\\n She aimed a look at him. \"Your mood\u0027s improved.\"\\n\\n \"Anticipation of pizza does that for me.\"\\n\\n \"No, I mean it.\"\\n\\n He shot a wave at someone across the street. \"I wallowed some. I need a good wallow once in a while, then I scrape it off.\"\\n\\n \"How?\"\\n\\n \"By remembering we all do what we do. By reminding myself I believe good mostly wins out in the long run. Sometimes the long run\u0027s a bitch, but good mostly wins out.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re cheering me up.\"\\n\\n \"Good. That was the plan.\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t exactly wallowing. I think I got jammed up at worrying. Pansies in the tub, that\u0027s a good sign, but I hate that it\u0027s offset by ones like this.\" She gestured toward the gift shop. \"I want to believe good mostly wins out, too, but it\u0027s hard knowing it costs so much, that some people have to lose.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s not a loss. Maybe they\u0027ll relocate to Iowa and hit the lottery, or double their business. Or they\u0027ll just be happier there, for whatever reason. The wheel\u0027s got to turn before you get anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"So says the man practicing law in the town where he was born.\"\\n\\n \"I turned the wheel.\" They crossed at the Square. \"It brought me right back here. Brought you here, too.\"\\n\\n He pulled open the door, and led her into the noise of the Bowl-a-Rama.\\n\\n \"To pizza and pinball.\"\\n\\n \"And pansies, to continue the alliteration. Then there\u0027s bowling and bonhomie.\"\\n\\n \"Bonhomie. Triple word score.\"\\n\\n \"Play your cards right.\" He turned her and, letting the mood carry him, laid his lips on hers before she could prepare herself. \"There could be sex and satisfaction.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not playing cards just yet.\"\\n\\n \"So we settle for friends and frivolity. And boy, am I done with that.\" He led her to lane six, where Cal sat along with Quinn and Cybil, changing shoes. \"Where\u0027s Turner?\"\\n\\n \"Deserted us for the arcade,\" Cybil told him.\\n\\n \"And the pinball rivalry continues. Catch you later.\"\\n\\n \"No problem. I\u0027ll have three beautiful women to myself.\" Cal held out a pair of bowling shoes. \"Size seven?\"\\n\\n \"That would be me.\" Layla slid into the booth as Fox gestured Cal a few steps away.\\n\\n \"How\u0027d you get Gage to come in?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s his father\u0027s night off. Bill\u0027s not around, so...\"\\n\\n \"Got it. I\u0027m going to go whip his ass at Tomcat. He\u0027ll be buying the beer.\"\\n\\n \"Tomcat?\" Cybil\u0027s eyebrows rose dramatically. \"Isn\u0027t that a war game?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\" Fox eyed her narrowly. \"What are you, my mother? And you don\u0027t have to mention me whipping Gage\u0027s ass at a war game to my mother if you should happen to run into her.\"\\n\\n An hour with the lights, the bells, the patter of antiair-craft cut away even the fading edges of Fox\u0027s pensive mood. It didn\u0027t hurt to stand and watch a trio of attractive women bend and stretch while he drank a victory beer. Gage had never been able to beat him at Tomcat.\\n\\n \"Best view in the house,\" Gage commented as they stood back, studying Quinn\u0027s posterior as she approached the line.\\n\\n \"Hard to beat. Friday night leagues are coming in.\" Fox glanced over where men and women in bowling shirts passed by the front desk. \"Cal\u0027s going to have a full house tonight.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s Napper.\" Gage sipped his beer while he studied the man in the maroon and cream team shirt. \"Is he still-\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Had some words with him just a couple days ago. He\u0027s just an older asshole now, with a badge.\"\\n\\n \"A fifty-eight.\" Layla plopped down to change her shoes after her last frame. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve discovered my newest passion.\"\\n\\n \"I like it,\" Cybil said as she sat beside her. \"I\u0027d vote for more attractive footwear, but I like the game, the destruct, reconstruct of it.\"\\n\\n \"Meaning?\"\\n\\n \"Deliver the ball, destroy the pins. Hit them right, you can make them destroy each other. Then, wait a minute, they\u0027re all back again, like ten soldiers. After all those war games,\" she said with a teasing smile for Fox, \"I\u0027m starving.\" She tipped her head back, looked at Gage. \"How\u0027d your battle fare?\"\\n\\n \"I do better with cards and women.\"\\n\\n \"I kicked his ass, as promised. Beer\u0027s on Gage.\"\\n\\n They didn\u0027t discuss the morning as they sat around a table with pizza and beer. They didn\u0027t talk about their plans for the next day. For the moment, they were simply a group of friends enjoying one another and the entertainment offered in a small, rural town.\\n\\n \"My game next time,\" Gage announced. \"A nice friendly game of poker.\" He sneered at Fox. \"We\u0027ll see who\u0027s buying the beer then.\"\\n\\n \"Anytime, anywhere.\" Fox grinned as he grabbed a slice of pizza. \"I\u0027ve been practicing.\"\\n\\n \"Strip poker doesn\u0027t count.\"\\n\\n \"Does if you win,\" he said with his mouth full.\\n\\n \"Look who\u0027s back!\" Shelley Kholer wiggled her way over in jeans designed to bruise internal organs and a shirt sized for an undeveloped twelve-year-old. She grabbed Gage\u0027s face with both hands and gave him a long, greedy and slightly drunken kiss.\\n\\n \"Hey, Shell,\" he said when he had his tongue back.\\n\\n \"I heard you were back, but haven\u0027t seen hide or hair. Aren\u0027t you just as yummy as ever? Why don\u0027t we-\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s new?\" he interrupted, and picked up a beer to shield his mouth from another assault.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting a divorce.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry to hear it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not. Block\u0027s a worthless, two-timing bastard with a dick the size of a pickle. One of those little ones, you know?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know that.\"\\n\\n \"Shoulda run away with you,\" she said and sent everyone at the table a blurry smile. \"Hi, y\u0027all. Hey, Fox! I want to talk to you about my divorce.\"\\n\\n She wanted to talk about her divorce twenty hours out of every twenty-four, Fox thought. The other four were reserved for talking about her sister who\u0027d gotten a little too friendly with Shelley\u0027s husband. \"Why don\u0027t you come into the office next week?\"\\n\\n \"I can talk freely here. I got no secrets. I got no secrets in the whole damn town. Every sumbitch in it knows my husband got caught with his hand on my sister\u0027s tit. I wanna add that thing, that loss of consortium-that loss of nookie thing to the complaint.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll talk about that. Why don\u0027t I buy you a cup of coffee up at the counter, and we can-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t want coffee. I got a nice buzz on to celebrate my upcoming divorce. I want another beer, and I want to make out with Gage. Like the old days.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t we have one anyway?\"\\n\\n \"I could make out with you,\" she said to Fox as he rose to lead her away. \"Did we ever make out?\"\\n\\n \"I was fifteen in the old days,\" Gage announced when Fox steered Shelley to the counter. \"I just want that on record.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s so unhappy. Sorry,\" Layla murmured. \"It\u0027s one of those things I can\u0027t help but pick up on. She\u0027s so miserable.\"\\n\\n \"Fox\u0027ll help her through it. It\u0027s what he does.\" Cal nodded toward the counter where Shelley sat, listening to Fox, her head resting on his shoulder. \"He\u0027s the sort of lawyer who takes the term counselor to heart.\"\\n\\n \"If my sister played squeeze the melons with my husband, I\u0027d want to skin him in a divorce, too.\" Cybil broke off a tiny corner of a nacho. \"That\u0027s if I were married. And after I\u0027d beaten them both to bloody pulps. Is her husband really named Block?\"\\n\\n \"Unfortunately,\" Cal confirmed.\\n\\n At the counter, Shelley ignored the coffee, but she listened.\\n\\n \"It\u0027d be better if you didn\u0027t badmouth Block in public. Say whatever you want about him to me, okay? But it\u0027s not good for you to go off on him, especially the size of his dick, in public.\"\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t really have a little pickle dick,\" Shelley muttered. \"But he should. He shouldn\u0027t have any dick at all.\"\\n\\n \"I know. Are you here by yourself?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" She sighed now. \"I came with my girlfriends. We\u0027re in the arcade. We\u0027re having a Fuck Men night. In the bad way.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s fine. You\u0027re not driving, are you, Shelley?\"\\n\\n \"No, we walked from Arlene\u0027s. We\u0027re going back there after. She\u0027s pissed at her boyfriend.\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re ready to go while I\u0027m still here, and you want someone to drive you, or walk you, come and get me.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the sweetest damn thing in the whole world.\"\\n\\n \"Do you want to go back to the arcade?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. We\u0027re going home soon anyway to make apple martinis and watch Thelma and Louise.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds great.\" He took her arm, steered her clear of Gage and the table, and walked her to the arcade.\\n\\n Deciding he\u0027d earned another beer, he swung back by the counter, ordered one on Gage\u0027s tab.\\n\\n \"So, you\u0027re sticking it to Shelley in more ways than one.\"\\n\\n Fox didn\u0027t turn at Napper\u0027s voice. \"Slow night for crime, Deputy Take-a-Nap?\"\\n\\n \"People with real jobs take nights off. What\u0027s your excuse?\"\\n\\n \"I like watching people without balls throw them.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder what\u0027ll happen to yours when Block finds out you\u0027re doing his wife.\"\\n\\n \"Here you go, Fox.\" Behind the counter, Holly set down Fox\u0027s drink, gave him a quick, understanding look. She\u0027d worked the counter for enough years to know when trouble was brewing. \"Get you something, Deputy?\"\\n\\n \"Pitcher of Bud. I bet Block\u0027s going to kick your pansy ass into next week.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to want to stay out of that.\" Fox turned now, faced Napper. \"Block and Shelley have enough problems without you screwing with them.\"\\n\\n \"You telling me what to do?\" He jabbed a finger into Fox\u0027s chest, bared his teeth in a fierce \"dare you\" grin.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m telling you Block and Shelley are going through a tough time and don\u0027t need you making it worse because you want to fuck with me.\" Fox picked up his beer. \"You need to move.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need to do a goddamn thing. It\u0027s my night off.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah? Mine, too.\" Fox, who\u0027d never been able to walk away from a dare, tipped the beer down Napper\u0027s shirt. \"Oops. Butterfingers.\"\\n\\n \"You stupid fuck.\" He shoved, and the force of it would\u0027ve knocked Fox on his ass, if he hadn\u0027t anticipated it.\\n\\n He danced lightly to the side, so that Napper\u0027s forward motion sent the deputy careening into one of the counter stools. When he righted himself, spun to retaliate, he wasn\u0027t just facing Fox, but Gage and Cal as well.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a damn shame,\" Gage drawled. \"All that beer wasted. Looks good on you though, Napper.\"\\n\\n \"We run your kind out of town these days, Turner.\"\\n\\n Gage spread his arms in invitation. \"Run me.\"\\n\\n \"None of us are looking for trouble here, Derrick.\" Cal took a step forward, his eyes hard on Napper\u0027s. \"This is a family place. Lots of kids in here. Lots of witnesses. I\u0027ll take you over to our gift shop, get you a new shirt. No charge.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want a damn thing from you.\" He sneered at Fox. \"Your friends won\u0027t always be around to protect you, O\u0027Dell.\"\\n\\n \"You keep forgetting the rules.\" Now Gage stepped forward, effectively blocking Fox before his friend rose to the bait. \"You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us. But Cal and I? We\u0027ll be happy to hold Fox\u0027s coat while he kicks the shit out of you. Wouldn\u0027t be the first time.\"\\n\\n \"Times change.\" Napper shoved his way past them.\\n\\n \"Not so much,\" Gage murmured. \"He\u0027s as big a dick as ever.\"\\n\\n \"Told you.\" With apparent ease, Fox stepped back up to the counter. \"I\u0027m going to need another beer, Holly.\"\\n\\n When he walked back to the table, Quinn gave him a sunny smile. \"Dinner and a show. This place has it all.\"\\n\\n \"That show\u0027s been running about twenty-five years.\"\\n\\n \"He hates you,\" Layla said quietly. \"He doesn\u0027t even know why.\"\\n\\n \"There doesn\u0027t have to be a why for some people.\" Fox laid a hand over hers. \"Forget him. How about a round of pinball-any machine. And you get a thousand-point handicap.\"\\n\\n \"I think that may be an insult, but... Don\u0027t! Don\u0027t drink that. God. Look.\"\\n\\n The beer glass in Fox\u0027s hand foamed with blood. He set it down slowly. \"Two wasted beers in one night. I guess the party\u0027s over.\"\\n\\n WHEN QUINN OPTED TO STAY AT THE BOWLING center with Cal until closing, Fox walked Layla and Cybil home. It was only a couple of blocks, and he knew they were far from defenseless. But he didn\u0027t like the idea of them being out at night on their own.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the back story on the jerk currently wearing your beer?\" Cybil asked him.\\n\\n \"Just a bully who\u0027s needled me since we were kids. Deputy Bully now.\"\\n\\n \"No particular reason?\"\\n\\n \"I was skinny, smaller than him-smarter, too-and came from tree-hugger stock.\"\\n\\n \"More than enough. Well...\" Her fingers gave his biceps a testing pinch. \"You\u0027re not skinny now. And you\u0027re still smarter than him.\" She sent Fox an approving smirk. \"Quicker, too.\"\\n\\n \"He wants to hurt you. It\u0027s on his top ten list of things to accomplish.\" Layla studied Fox\u0027s profile as they crossed the street. \"He won\u0027t stop. His kind doesn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Napper\u0027s top ten list isn\u0027t my biggest concern. He has to get in line.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, home again.\" Cybil climbed the first step, turned, looked around the quiet street. \"We managed bowling, dinner, a minor brawl, and a memo from evil, and it\u0027s still shy of eleven. The fun never ends in Hawkins Hollow.\" She laid her hands on Fox\u0027s shoulders. \"Thanks for walking us home, cutie.\" She gave him a light kiss. \"See you in the morning. Layla, why don\u0027t you work out the logistics- timing, transportation-with Fox and let me know. I\u0027ll be upstairs.\"\\n\\n \"My parents should be out of the house by eight,\" he told Layla when Cybil strolled away. \"I can come by and pick you all up if you need.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right. We\u0027ll take Quinn\u0027s car, I imagine. Who\u0027s going to walk you home, Fox?\"\\n\\n \"I remember the way.\"\\n\\n \"You know what I mean. You should come in, stay here.\"\\n\\n He smiled, eased in a little closer. \"Where here?\"\\n\\n \"On the couch, for now anyway.\" She put a fingertip to his chest, eased him right back.\\n\\n \"Your couch is lumpy, and you only have basic cable.\\n\\n You need to work on your strategy. If you\u0027d asked me to stay because you were worried about it just being you and Cybil in the house, I\u0027d be trying to sleep on your couch with a rerun of Law and Order while I was thinking about you upstairs in bed. Kiss me good night, Layla.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I am worried about being in the house, just me and Cybil.\"\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re not. Kiss me good night.\"\\n\\n She sighed. She really was going to have to work on her strategy. Deliberately, she tipped her face up, and gave him the light, friendly kiss Cybil had. \"Good night. Be careful.\"\\n\\n \"Careful doesn\u0027t always get the job done. Case in point.\"\\n\\n He caught her face in his hands, lowered his lips to hers. Though the kiss was soft, though it was slow, she felt the impact from the top of her head to the soles of her feet. The glide of his tongue, the brush of his thumbs at her temples, the solid line of his body dissolved her bones.\\n\\n He held her face even as he lifted his head, looked into her eyes. \"That was a kiss good night.\"\\n\\n \"It was. No question about it.\"\\n\\n He kissed her again with the same silky confidence until she had to grip his forearms for balance.\\n\\n \"Now neither one of us will get any sleep.\" He stepped back. \"So my work here is done. Unfortunately. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" She made it to the door before she turned, looked back at him from what she considered a safe distance. \"I have a careful nature, especially when it\u0027s important. I think sex is important, or should be.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s on my top ten list of personal priorities.\"\\n\\n She laughed, opened the door. \"Good night, Fox.\"\\n\\n Inside, Layla went straight upstairs where Cybil came out of the office, eyebrow lifted. \"Alone?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Can I ask why you\u0027re not about to get a good taste of adorable lawyer?\"\\n\\n \"I think he might matter too much.\"\\n\\n \"Ah.\" With a knowing nod, Cybil leaned on the doorjamb. \"That always tangles things up. Want to work off some sexual frustration with research and logs?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure charts and graphs have that kind of power, but I\u0027ll give it a shot.\" She shrugged out of her jacket as she stepped into the office. \"What do you do when they might matter too much?\"\\n\\n \"Generally, I run-either straight into it or away. It\u0027s had mixed results.\" Cybil walked over to study the map of the town Layla had generated and pinned to the wall.\\n\\n \"I tend to circle around and around, weigh and think entirely too much. I\u0027m wondering now if it was because I tuned in.\" She tapped her head. \"Without really knowing I was tuning in.\"\\n\\n \"That may be.\" Cybil picked up a red pushpin- representing blood-stuck it into the bowling center on the map to signal another incident. \"But Fox would be a lot to think about under normal circumstances. Add in the abnormal, and it\u0027s a lot to consider. Take your time if time\u0027s what you need.\"\\n\\n \"Under normal circumstances that would be reasonable.\" At the desk, Layla chose a red index card, wrote: Bloody Beer, Fox, Bowl-a-Rama, and the time and date. \"But time is one of the issues, isn\u0027t it? And how much we may actually have.\"\\n\\n \"You sound like Gage. It\u0027s a good thing you two didn\u0027t hook up or you\u0027d never look beyond the dark side.\"\\n\\n \"That may be, but...\" Frowning, Layla studied the map. \"There\u0027s another pin, a black pin on the road between Fox\u0027s house and Cal\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Standing for the big, ugly dog. Didn\u0027t I tell you? No, that\u0027s right, you went straight from work to the center. Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me now.\"\\n\\n Once she had, Layla selected a dark blue card, the color she\u0027d chosen for any demon-in-animal-form sighting, filled it in.\\n\\n \"I hate to say this, but while my mind is now occupied and my hands busy, I\u0027m still sexually frustrated.\"\\n\\n \"There, there.\" Cybil patted Layla\u0027s shoulder. \"I\u0027m going to go make some tea. We\u0027ll add some chocolate. That always helps.\"\\n\\n Layla doubted if candy was going to satisfy her appetite for adorable lawyer, but she\u0027d take what she could get. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hollow-sign-of-seven-2/page-8.html","bookId":2249,"book":{"id":2249,"title":"The Hollow (Sign of Seven #2)","description":"Storyline: The Hollow (Sign of Seven #2) \\n In the small village of Hawkins Hollow, three best friends who share the same birthday sneak off into the woods for a sleepover the evening before turning 10.
