{"id":28359,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII POOR AND PROUD","content":"“Good morning, Squire Leech,” said Herbert, politely. “Good morning,” said the squire, jumping to the conclusion that the Carters had made up their minds to sell their place. “Do you wish to see me?” “Yes, sir; I hope I don\u0027t interrupt you.” “Go on,” said the squire, waving his hand. “I am busy, to be sure, but I can give you a few minutes.” He resolved to take advantage of Mrs. Carter\u0027s necessities, and make a smaller offer for the place. In this way he would make her suffer for her former obstinate refusal to entertain his proposition. His face fell when Herbert said: “I came to ask you if you could give me employment on one of your farms. My mother has been sick, and I feel that I ought to be doing something to earn money.” “Ahem!” said the squire, “I leave all such matters to Mr. Banks. Was that all you wished to say to me?” “I believe so,” said Herbert. “Will there be any use in applying to Mr. Banks?” “I don\u0027t know whether he has got help enough or not. Your mother has been sick, hasn\u0027t she?” “Yes, sir; all winter.” “I heard of it. I suppose you found it expensive, eh?” “Yes, sir. Neither of us could earn anything.” “You are in debt, then?” “No, sir. My uncle left us some money last year. That kept us along.” “It\u0027s pretty much used up now, I suppose?” “Not quite.” Herbert was inclined to be surprised at the squire\u0027s apparent interest in their affairs, but the motive soon became apparent. “Well, you have made up your mind to sell the house now, I suppose?” said the squire. “No, we hadn\u0027t thought of it.” “But you\u0027ll have to.” “Not if I can get employment,” said Herbert. “Our expenses are very small, and we can live on a little.” The great man frowned. “That is all nonsense,” he said, impatiently. “It is quite impossible for you to hold on to the house. I am willing to give you cash down three hundred dollars over and above the mortgage for it.” “That isn\u0027t as much as you offered last year,” said Herbert, shrewdly. “I believe I did offer three hundred and fifty then.” “Your last offer was fifty dollars more than that.” “It may be so, but I told your mother that it wasn\u0027t a standing offer. She must accept it then or not at all.” “We don\u0027t ask you to purchase,” said Herbert, independently. “I had no idea of such a thing when I came here.” “That makes no difference. You will have to sell, of course, and I have made up my mind to offer you three hundred and fifty. If you had taken me up at the time, I would have given you fifty more. You can\u0027t expect that now, however.” “We don\u0027t expect anything. The house is not for sale.” “Then, why are you taking up my valuable time?” demanded the squire, frowning with displeasure. “I beg your pardon, sir. I only came in to ask for employment.” “That I might have given you, if you hadn\u0027t been so unreasonable.” “I don\u0027t think we are unreasonable, Squire Leech. Even if we were willing to sell, we should ask, at least, fourteen hundred dollars for the place.” “Fourteen hundred! Are you crazy? I never heard of such a thing.” “The place, land and all, cost my father fifteen hundred.” “I don\u0027t believe it.” “We\u0027ve got his papers to show that it is so.” “It isn\u0027t worth near that now.” “It is certainly worth more than eleven hundred, which is all you offer.” “Look here, Carter,” said the squire, “I don\u0027t mind telling you that I want the place for one of my men—Brown. That is my only object in making you an offer at all. He is the cousin of Mr. Banks, my superintendent, and I rather think Banks will find you something to do, if you will induce your mother to sell the place.” “I can\u0027t do that,” said Herbert, slowly. “I can\u0027t consent to my mother making such a sacrifice. She might as well give you three or four hundred dollars as sell the place so much under price.” “You are a boy, and know nothing about business. You think property must necessarily bring its first cost, though, mind you, I don\u0027t admit that yours cost anything like fifteen hundred dollars.” “I am inexperienced,” Herbert admitted, “but I am sure it would be foolish to sell for eleven hundred dollars.” “You may have to sell for less.” “How is that?” “If you are not prepared with the interest when the time comes, I shall foreclose.” “You wouldn\u0027t be so hard on us as that, Squire Leech,” said Herbert, anxiously. “I don\u0027t call it hard, it is only just and legal. When that time comes, I don\u0027t promise to pay as much as I offer to-day.” Herbert looked serious. He saw that the squire meant just what he said; that, in fact, he was lying in wait their need should put them in his power. “Well,” said the squire, triumphantly, “you see how the matter stands now?” “I do,” said Herbert. “Then you will cease your foolish opposition to what is best for you.” “I will speak to my mother about it,” said Herbert, rising. “The place is hers, not mine, and she must decide.” “Without your offering any foolish advice, I hope.” “I can\u0027t say as to that, Squire Leech. I will bid you good morning.” “Good morning. If you change your mind, call again, and we will see about the employment.” “Well,” said James, as Herbert came out, “did you get work?” “Not yet; your father is not sure whether he will find any for me.” “When I am a man,” said James, pompously, “I do say I may be able to throw something in your way.” “Thank you,” said Herbert, tempted to smile in spite of his serious thoughts. “I shall be richer than my father,” added James, “his property is increasing every year.” “You have an excellent prospect before you,” said Herbert, half enviously. “That\u0027s so. Wouldn\u0027t you like to change places with me?” “I am not sure about that.” “You are not sure about that?” repeated James, incredulously. “No.” “Why, I am a rich man\u0027s son.” “I know that; but I have an excellent mother.” “She has got no money.” “I should not value her more if she were worth a million,” said Herbert, warmly. “Of course,” said James; “but that won\u0027t save you from being a day laborer.” “It is my great ambition just at present to become a day laborer,” said Herbert, smiling. “Of course, there\u0027s a great difference between us. But I say, Carter, can you help me with this kite? There\u0027s something wrong about it. It won\u0027t fly.” Herbert looked at it critically. “The trouble is with the frame,” he said. “It\u0027s too heavy.” “I wish you\u0027d help me about it.” Very good-naturedly our hero set to work, and in the course of twenty minutes or so the difficulty was obviated. The kite would fly. “You may stay and help me fly it,” said James, condescendingly. “Thank you; I shall be needed at home.” “Oh, I forgot. Your time is valuable. Here, take this.” James, with extraordinary liberality, held out five cents to Herbert. “What is that for?” asked Herbert, puzzled, and not offering to take the money. “For your help about the kite.” “Oh, I wouldn\u0027t think of charging anything for that,” said Herbert, amused. “Why not? You are poor, and I am rich.” “I know it, but I don\u0027t want money for a trifle like that.” “Just as you say,” said James, returning the money to his pocket, a little relieved, if the truth must be told, that the coin was not accepted, for he was naturally fond of money. “Good morning,” said Herbert, turning to go. “If the kite gets out of order, you can call upon me any time.” “I wonder why he didn\u0027t take the money,” thought James. “He may be poor and proud; I\u0027ve heard of such cases; but of course it would be absurd for a boy in his position to be proud.” Herbert kept on his way with a very serious face. It seemed as if they must lose their home, after all. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2977/82052.html","bookId":346,"book":{"id":346,"title":"Herbert Carter\u0027s Legacy","description":"简介： Horatio Alger, Jr., an author who lived among and for boys and himself remained a boy in heart and association till death, was born at Revere, Mass., January 13, 1834.
