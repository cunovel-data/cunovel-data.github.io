{"id":28378,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI A NEW START","content":"Harvest came, and for the time Herbert was busy. He could not afford to hire assistance, and was obliged to do all the work himself. When all was finished, and his share of the vegetables sold, he sat down to count up his profits. “Well, mother,” he asked, “how much money do you think I have made by farming?” “You expected to make twenty dollars.” “I have cleared twenty-one dollars and a half besides the vegetables I have brought home and stored in the cellar.” “That is doing very well,” said Mrs. Carter. “I have had to work very hard for it,” said Herbert, thoughtfully, “and for a good many days. After all, it isn\u0027t quite enough to pay our interest.” “The interest doesn\u0027t come due for six weeks yet.” “That is true, mother; but six weeks hence we shall be poorer than we are now. We shall have to use some of this money for current expenses, and I know of no way to replace it.” “You may earn some more.” “I don\u0027t see any chance—that is, here. There is nothing doing in Wrayburn. If there were any factories or workshops, I might stand a chance of getting something to do.” Mrs. Carter did not reply. She knew that Herbert was right, and she had nothing to suggest. “I have thought of something,” said Herbert; “but you may not like it at first.” “What is it?” asked his mother, with interest. “Would you have any objection to my going to New York and trying my fortune there?” Mrs. Carter uttered a little cry of dismay. “You go to New York—a boy of your age!” she exclaimed. “I am old enough to take care of myself,” said Herbert, sturdily. “A great city is a dangerous place.” “It won\u0027t be dangerous for me. I shall be too busy—that is, if I get work—to fall into temptation, if that is what you mean.” “I should miss you so much, Herbert, even if I knew you were doing well,” said his mother, pathetically. “I know you would, mother; and I should miss you, too; but I can\u0027t live here always. If I do well in the city you can come and join me there.” This was the first time Herbert broached the subject of going to New York. He resumed the attack the next day, and the next, and finally won his mother\u0027s consent to go for a week, and see whether he could find anything to do. His mother\u0027s consent obtained, Herbert took but a day to make his preparations. The next day, after an early breakfast, he started for the great city, excited with the idea of going, but hardly able to repress the tears as he saw the lonely look upon his mother\u0027s face. He was her only son, and she was a widow. “I must send her good news as soon as possible,” he thought. “That will cheer her up.” About noon Herbert reached the city. He had formed no particular plan, except to find Cornelius Dixon, who would doubtless be able to advise him about getting a place, perhaps would have influence enough to procure him one. He did not know where to look for Cornelius, but concluded that his name would be in the city directory. He entered a small liquor store, which he happened to pass, and walked up to the counter. “Good-morning,” said he politely, addressing a young man behind the bar. This young man had coarse red hair, and a mottled complexion, and looked as if he patronized freely the liquors he sold. He turned his glance upon Herbert, who stood before him with his fresh, inquiring face, holding under his arm a small bundle of clothing tied up in a paper. “Hello, yourself!” he answered. “Want some bitters?” “Thank you,” said Herbert, innocently, “I don\u0027t require any medicine.” “Medicine?” repeated the other, with a frown. “Do you mean to compare my drinks to medicine?” “You said bitters,” returned Herbert. “You\u0027re from the country, ain\u0027t you?” asked the bartender. “Yes, sir.” “So I thought. You haven\u0027t cut your eyeteeth yet. When a gentleman takes a drink he takes his bitters. Now, what\u0027ll you have?” “Nothing, thank you.” “Oh, you needn\u0027t thank me. I didn\u0027t offer to give you a drink. What do you want, anyhow?” “Have you got a directory?” “No; we don\u0027t keep one. We don\u0027t care where our customers live. All we want is their money.” Herbert did not fancy the bartender\u0027s tone or manner; but felt that it would be foolish to get angry. So he explained: “I have a cousin living in the city; I thought I could find out where he lived in the directory.” “What\u0027s your cousin\u0027s name?” “Cornelius Dixon.” “Never heard of him. He don\u0027t buy his bitters at this shop.” It was clear that no satisfaction was to be found here, and Herbert looked further. Finally, at a druggist\u0027s he found a directory, and hopefully looked for the name. But another disappointment awaited him. There were several Dixons, but Cornelius was not among them. “I must give him up, and see what I can do by myself,” thought Herbert. “I wish I could come across him.” It seemed strange to him that one who was so prominent as Cornelius claimed to be, and who had been living for years in the city, should have been overlooked by the compilers of the directory. He was not discouraged, however; he expected to encounter difficulties, and this was the first one. He kept on his way, attracting some attention as he walked. The city Arab knows a stranger by instinct. “Carry your bundle, mister?” asked a ragged urchin. “No; thank you. I can carry it myself.” “I won\u0027t charge you much. Take you to any hotel in the city.” “I don\u0027t think I shall go to any hotel. I can\u0027t afford it. Can you show me a cheap boarding house?” “Yes,” said the boy. “What\u0027ll you give?” “Ten cents.” “That ain\u0027t enough. It wouldn\u0027t keep me in cigars an hour.” “Do you smoke?” asked Herbert, surprised. “In course I do. I\u0027ve smoked for four or five years.” “How old are you?” “The old woman says I\u0027m ten. She ought to know.” “It isn\u0027t good for boys to smoke,” said Herbert, gravely. “Oh, bosh! Dry up! All us boys smoke.” Herbert felt that his advice was not called for, and he came to business. “I\u0027ll give you fifteen cents,” he said, “if you\u0027ll show me a good, cheap boarding house.” “Well,” said the Arab, “business is poor, and I\u0027ll do it for once. Come along.” Herbert concluded from the boy\u0027s appearance that he would be more likely to know of cheap than of fashionable boarding houses; but it did not occur to him that there was such a thing as being too cheap. He realized it when the boy brought him to the door of a squalid dwelling in a filthy street, and, pointing to it, complacently remarked: “That\u0027s the place you want—that\u0027s Rafferty\u0027s.” Herbert stared at it in dismay. Accustomed to the utmost neatness, he was appalled at the idea of lodging in such a place. “Gimme them fifteen cents, mister,” said the boy, impatiently. “But I don\u0027t like the place. I wouldn\u0027t stay here.” “It\u0027s cheap,” said the young Arab. “Rafferty\u0027ll give you a lodging for ten cents, meals fifteen. You can\u0027t complain of that, now.” “I don\u0027t complain of the price. It\u0027s dirty. I wouldn\u0027t stay in such a dirty place.” “Oh, you\u0027re a fine gentleman, you are!” said the boy, sarcastically. “You\u0027d better go to the Fifth Avenoo Hotel, you had.” “I won\u0027t stop here. I want some decent place.” Meanwhile, Mrs. Rafferty herself had come to the door, and caught the meaning of the conference. She took instant umbrage at Herbert\u0027s last words. “Dacent, do ye say?” she repeated, with flaming eyes and arms akimbo. “Who dares to say that Bridget Rafferty doesn\u0027t keep a dacent house?” “He does,” said the Arab, indicating Herbert, with a grin. “And who are you, I\u0027d like to know?” demanded Mrs. Rafferty, turning upon Herbert angrily. “Who are you, that talks agin\u0027 a poor widder that\u0027s tryin\u0027 to earn an honest living?” “I beg your pardon, madam,” said Herbert, anxious to get out of the scrape. “I meant no offense.” “Lucky for you, thin!” said Mrs. Rafferty, in a belligerent tone. “Be off wid you both, thin, or I\u0027ll call a cop.” Herbert turned to go, nothing loath, but his guide followed him. “Gimme them fifteen cents,” he demanded. “You haven\u0027t shown me a good boarding place.” “Yes, I did.” “You don\u0027t seem to know what I want. I\u0027ll give you five cents, and look out for myself.” The young Arab tried for ten; but Herbert was firm. He felt that he had no money to waste, and that he had selected a poor guide. It was wiser to rely upon himself.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2977/82071.html","bookId":346,"book":{"id":346,"title":"Herbert Carter\u0027s Legacy","description":"简介： Horatio Alger, Jr., an author who lived among and for boys and himself remained a boy in heart and association till death, was born at Revere, Mass., January 13, 1834.
