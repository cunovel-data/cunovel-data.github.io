{"id":28350,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III HERBERT MEETS A RELATIVE","content":"Herbert had never been to Randolph. In fact, he had never been so far away from Wrayburn. He was not afraid of losing his way, however. Here and there along the road guideposts were conveniently placed, and these removed any difficulty on that score. When he had gone about six miles, the coach rattled by. It had started more than an hour later. Herbert turned out for the lumbering vehicle, and waited for it to pass. There was a boy on top, but such was the cloud of dust that he could not at first recognize him. It happened, however, that one of the traces broke, so that the driver was compelled to make a stop just as he overtook our hero. Then he saw that the boy on top was James Leech. With James curiosity overcame his disinclination to speak to one so far beneath him. “Where are you going. Carter?” he inquired. “To Randolph,” was the answer. “Going to walk all the way?” “I expect to,” said Herbert, not relishing the cross-examination. “Why don\u0027t you ride?” James did not ask for information. He knew well enough already, but as there are purse-proud men, so there are boys who are actuated by feelings equally unworthy, and it delighted him to remind Herbert of his poverty. Herbert divined this, but he was proud in his way, and answered: “Because I choose.” “Well, you must like the dust, that\u0027s all,” said James, complacently tapping his well-polished boot with a light cane which he had bought. “Where are you going?” asked Herbert, thinking it about time for him to commence questioning. “I\u0027m going to Randolph, too,” answered James, with unwonted affability. “I\u0027m going to stop a few days with a friend of mine, Tom Spencer. His father\u0027s a rich man—got a nice place there. Didn\u0027t you ever hear of Mr. Spencer, the lawyer?” “I don\u0027t think I have.” “That\u0027s his father. He makes a load of money by his law business. I think I shall study law some time. Perhaps I\u0027ll go into partnership with him. What are you going to be?” “I don\u0027t know yet,” said Herbert. “I suppose you\u0027ll be a mechanic of some kind—a carpenter, or mason, or bricklayer.” “Perhaps so,” said Herbert, quietly. “What are you going to Randolph for?” asked James, with sudden curiosity. “To attend my uncle\u0027s funeral.” “What\u0027s your uncle\u0027s name?” “The same as mine.” “I suppose he was poor.” “No, he was rich.” “Was he?” repeated James, in some surprise. “What do you think he was worth?” “About a hundred thousand dollars.” “Sho! you don\u0027t say so. Perhaps,” continued James, with new-born respect, “he has left you something in his will.” “I don\u0027t think so.” “Why not?” “He hasn\u0027t shown any interest in us for six years, and I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll remember us now.” James looked thoughtful. He had never before heard of this relationship, or he would have treated Herbert differently. The mere fact of having a wealthy relative elevated our hero considerably in his eyes. Then, too, there was a possibility that Herbert would turn out a legatee. “When is your uncle\u0027s funeral?” he inquired, after a pause. “This afternoon.” “You won\u0027t get there in time. You had better get up and ride.” “No, I guess not.” “Well, perhaps I shall meet you at Randolph.” By this time the harness was repaired, the driver resumed his seat, and whipped up the horses to make up for lost time. “I\u0027m glad I don\u0027t think as much of money as James Leech,” thought Herbert. “I suppose if my uncle would only leave us a good round sum, he would forget that I once wore patched pants, and accept me as his intimate friend.” This was exactly what James would have done, and Herbert showed that he was not wholly without knowledge of the world in forming the conjecture. Pausing occasionally to rest, Herbert at length accomplished his journey, arriving at Randolph a little after noon. He stopped just outside the village and ate his frugal dinner, which by this time he was prepared to relish. He then took off his jacket and beat the dust out of it, dusted his shoes, and washed his face in a little brook by the roadside. Having thus effaced the marks of travel, he entered the village and inquired the way to the residence of his late uncle. He found out where it was, but did not go there yet, knowing that there would be preparations going on for the funeral. Neither did he go to the tavern, for he knew that he would be expected to dine there, and this was an expense which he did not feel able to incur. He threw himself down in the shade of a tree, and remained there until after he heard the church clock strike two. He was still lying there when a young man, smartly dressed, sporting a showy watch chain and locket and an immense necktie, came up the street and accosted him. “I say, boy, can you tell me where old man Carter\u0027s house is?” “Yes,” said Herbert. “Do you want to go there?” “Of course I do. I\u0027m one of the relatives. I\u0027ve come all the way from New York to attend the funeral.” “I\u0027m one of the relations, too,” said Herbert. “We\u0027ll go along together.” “By Jove, that\u0027s strange! How are you related to the old chap?” drawled the young man. “He was my mother\u0027s uncle.” “Was he? Well, I\u0027m a second or third cousin, I don\u0027t know which. Never saw him to my knowledge. In fact, I wouldn\u0027t have come on to the funeral if I hadn\u0027t heard that he was rich. Expect to be remembered?” “I don\u0027t think so. He hasn\u0027t taken any notice of mother or myself for years.” “Indeed!” said the young man, who was rather pleased to hear this intelligence. “Are there many relations, do you know?” “I don\u0027t think there are.” “That\u0027s good. It makes our chance better, you know. I say, what\u0027s your name?” “Herbert Carter.” “Same as the old man\u0027s?” “Yes.” “Did he know you was named for him?” “Of course.” “Then he may leave you something for the name,” suggested the other, not very well pleased. “I don\u0027t expect anything. What is your name?” “Cornelius Dixon. I\u0027m related to the old man on my mother\u0027s side.” “Are you in business in New York?” asked Herbert, who, in spite of the queer manners of his new relative, felt considerable respect for one who hailed from so important a city. “Yes, I\u0027m a salesman in a New York store. Where do you live?” “In Wrayburn.” “Where\u0027s that?” “About twenty miles from here.” “Some one-horse country town, I suppose. Are you in any business?” “No,” said Herbert, “but I\u0027d like to be. Do you think you could get me a place in New York?” “Well,” said Cornelius, flattered by the belief in his influence which this inquiry implied, “perhaps I might. You can give me your name and address, so I can write to you if I hear of anything. If the old man only leaves me a few thousand dollars, I\u0027ll go into business for myself, and then I\u0027d have an opening for you.” “I hope he will, then.” “So do I. That is where we both agree. But perhaps it will be you that will get the cash.” “I don\u0027t think so.” “If you do, put it into my hands, and go into partnership with me. I\u0027ve got business experience, you know; while you\u0027re green, countrified, you know. It would never do for you to start alone.” “No, I shouldn\u0027t think of it.” “Then it\u0027s agreed, is it?” said Cornelius. “If I get a legacy, I\u0027ll take you into my store. If you get it, you will go into partnership with me.” “I\u0027m willing,” said Herbert, who really believed that his companion had as valuable business qualifications as he claimed. How was he to know that the pretentious Cornelius was only a salesman, at twelve dollars a week, in a dry-goods store on Eighth Avenue? By this time they had reached the rather dingy-looking house of their deceased relative. The front door was open. They passed through the gate, and, entering, took their places with the mourners. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2977/82043.html","bookId":346,"book":{"id":346,"title":"Herbert Carter\u0027s Legacy","description":"简介： Horatio Alger, Jr., an author who lived among and for boys and himself remained a boy in heart and association till death, was born at Revere, Mass., January 13, 1834.
