{"id":28374,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII THE RACE","content":"James broached the subject which was uppermost in his mind as soon as he got home. “I wish you\u0027d buy me a new boat, father,” he said. “What\u0027s the matter with the boat you have now?” “I don\u0027t want to be outdone by Herbert Carter.” “I don\u0027t see how that can be.” “He\u0027s got a beautiful new boat, twice as handsome as mine ever was.” “He has!” exclaimed the squire, in amazement. “How can he have, without any money?” “Mr. Cameron gave it to him.” “I don\u0027t believe it. Probably the boat belongs to Mr. Cameron and he has only let Herbert use it.” “No, Mr. Cameron gave it to him. Herbert told me.” “Perhaps he has not told the truth.” “He wouldn\u0027t tell a lie—that is, about that,” said James, modifying his first assertion lest it might be a compliment. In reality he had implicit confidence in Herbert\u0027s word. “You wouldn\u0027t want me to be rowing around in a poor boat, while that beggar has a new one,” said James, artfully appealing to his father\u0027s pride. “Well, the fact is, my son,” said the squire, rather embarrassed, “it would not be convenient for me to buy you a new boat just now.” “Why not, father? I thought you had plenty of money.” “So I have; but I have made some investments under the advice of Mr. Temple. If you can arrange to exchange boats by paying a little to boot, you may do so.” “I have proposed it, but Herbert is very stiff about it.” “Humph!” said the squire, clearing his throat; “I think you will have to wait a while.” “How long?” asked James, dissatisfied. “I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do,” said his father, “If things go well, I expect to make a good deal of money within twelve months. Instead of a rowboat, I\u0027ll buy you a beautiful little sailboat next season.” “Will you?” exclaimed James, delighted. “Yes; won\u0027t that be much better?” “You are right, father.” Certainly a sailboat would be far better and there was very little chance of Herbert\u0027s having one given him. So James went cut rowing contentedly the next afternoon, although Herbert was out also in the new boat. “Your boat is better than mine,” said James. “However, I am to have an elegant yacht next year.” “Are you?” said Herbert, interested. “Father has promised to get me one. He would get me one this season but it would be some time before it could be got ready and I can have it the first thing next spring.” “I congratulate you,” said Herbert. “I should like a sailboat myself.” “I dare say you would,” said James, pompously, “but of course you cannot expect to have one.” “I don\u0027t think there is much chance myself, unless somebody leaves me a fortune,” said Herbert, good-naturedly. “I am satisfied with this boat.” “Of course it is more than a boy in your circumstances could expect.” Herbert smiled. He was used to references to his circumstances. James never allowed him to forget that he was a poor boy. He thought it hardly worth noticing. “Shall we have a race?” he asked. “Just as you say,” said James. James thought himself the better rower or he would not have consented to row across the pond. “Are you ready?” asked Herbert. “Yes.” “Give way, then.” Both bent to their oars and rowed their best. But it was not long before Herbert began to draw away from his antagonist. He had not had as much practice as James, but he was stronger in the arms, and had paid more attention to Cameron\u0027s instructions. He came in more than a dozen lengths ahead of his competitor. “I\u0027ve won the race, James,” he said, with a smile. “You ought to,” said James, in a surly tone. “I haven\u0027t had as much practice as you.” “What if you haven\u0027t? You\u0027ve got a new boat, while mine is old and clumsy.” “If you think that makes any difference I\u0027ll row back with you, changing boats.” “Agreed,” said James. But James brought up the rear at about the same distance. “Beaten again,” said Herbert, pleased with his success. “There\u0027s nothing to crow about,” said James, crossly. “Your boat is a good one but I\u0027m not used to it.” “I am not much used to it myself. I only rowed in it yesterday for the first time.” “That\u0027s long enough to get the hang of it. There isn\u0027t much fun in rowing. I\u0027d a good deal rather sail.” “I like both. There\u0027s more exercise in rowing.” “Don\u0027t you get exercise enough in hoeing potatoes?” asked James, with a sneer. “I shouldn\u0027t think laborers would need any extra exercise.” “There\u0027s some advantage in varying your exercise. There isn\u0027t much fun in hoeing.” “No, I should think not.” “Are you going in?” asked Herbert, noticing that James was proceeding to fasten his boat. “Yes, I\u0027ve got tired of the water.” Herbert was not to be alone, however, for just then Mr. Cameron appeared on the bank. “I think I\u0027ll go out with you,” he said. “All right,” said Herbert, with alacrity, as he rowed the boat to shore. “Mr. Cameron,” said our hero, “mother has asked me to invite you to take tea with us this evening.” “I shall be very glad to come,” said Cameron. “We live in humble style, you know,” said Herbert, “but I told mother you wouldn\u0027t mind that.” “Thank you for saying so. I shall be very glad to meet your mother, and expect to enjoy myself better than at Squire Leech\u0027s table. It isn\u0027t the style, but the company. Why is James going away so soon?” “I have beaten him in two races,” said Herbert. “I am not surprised to hear of your success. You are really gaining very fast.” “I am glad of it. I want to be a good rower.” “It is a good thing to do well anything you undertake, whether it be rowing or anything else.” “James thinks I don\u0027t need to row for exercise.” “Why not?” “He thinks I shall get enough exercise in hoeing potatoes,” answered Herbert, with a smile. “It wouldn\u0027t do him any harm to get exercise in the same way.” “The very idea would shock him.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2977/82067.html","bookId":346,"book":{"id":346,"title":"Herbert Carter\u0027s Legacy","description":"简介： Horatio Alger, Jr., an author who lived among and for boys and himself remained a boy in heart and association till death, was born at Revere, Mass., January 13, 1834.
