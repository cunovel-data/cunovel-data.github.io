{"id":28373,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI THE RIVAL BOATMEN","content":"Herbert, bending over his oars, heard the peremptory order of James to come back and smiled to himself as he instantly comprehended the mistake which the latter had made. From James\u0027 standpoint his own boat was not visible and it was not surprising that he should suspect our hero of having appropriated his boat. “I won\u0027t undeceive him,” he thought. “What do you want?” he asked, resting on his oars, and looking back at James. “You know what I want,” said James, provoked. “How should I know?” “I want you to come right back, at once.” “What\u0027s happened? What am I wanted for?” “You\u0027ll be wanted by the constable.” “I don\u0027t understand you,” said Herbert, shrugging his shoulders. “You appear to be mad about something.” “So I am, and I have a right to be.” “Well, I\u0027m sure I have no objection, if you like it.” James was pale with rage. “Bring that boat right back here,” he said. “If you\u0027ll give me a good reason, perhaps I will; but I don\u0027t think it necessary to obey you without.” “You are a thief.” “Say that again,” said Herbert, sternly, “and I will come ashore and give you a whipping.” “You can\u0027t do it.” “I can try.” “Don\u0027t you know I can have you arrested for stealing my boat, you loafer?” “Who\u0027s been stealing your boat, you loafer?” “You have.” “Are you sure of it?” “Why, you are in my boat this very minute.” “I think you are mistaken,” said Herbert, quietly. “Don\u0027t you call that a boat you are in?” “Yes, I do; but there\u0027s more than one boat in the world, and this isn\u0027t your boat.” He rowed near the shore as he spoke, and James, his attention drawn to the boat, saw that it wasn\u0027t his. At the same time, walking nearer the edge of the pond, he caught sight of his own boat moored at its usual place. “I guess I made a mistake,” said James. “I think you have,” returned Herbert, quietly. “Where did that boat come from?” demanded James. “I don\u0027t know.” “You don\u0027t? Then you\u0027ve taken it without leave.” “Oh, the owner won\u0027t object to my using it,” said Herbert, with a queer smile. “How do you know?” “He\u0027s an intimate friend of mine.” “The owner?” “Yes.” “I suppose it belongs to Mr. Cameron, then?” “He bought it.” “Do you call him your intimate friend? He\u0027d be proud if he heard it,” said James, with a sneer. “Would he?” said Herbert. “I should think he would, considering your high position in society.” “I think he\u0027s a pretty good friend of mine but I have never called him an intimate friend.” “Yes, you have. You said the owner of that boat was an intimate friend of yours.” “So he is. I\u0027m with him all the time.” “Then why do you deny that you called Mr. Cameron your intimate friend?” “Because Mr. Cameron doesn\u0027t own the boat.” “Just now you said he bought it.” “So he did, but he doesn\u0027t own it.” “Then who does?” “I do,” was the unexpected reply. “You—own—that—boat?” ejaculated James. “Yes.” “Did Mr. Cameron give it to you?” “Yes.” “I don\u0027t believe it. That boat must have cost sixty or seventy dollars. I don\u0027t believe he would give you such a present as that.” “I don\u0027t know as it makes much difference.” “When did he give it to you?” “This afternoon. I\u0027ll row in. Perhaps you would like to examine it.” James surveyed with envious eyes the neat, graceful boat, for he saw at a glance that his own boat, even when new, was by no means its equal. “Isn\u0027t it a beauty?” asked Herbert, not without pride. “Very fair,” answered James, condescendingly. “Did you ask Mr. Cameron to give it to you?” “I never ask for gifts,” said Herbert, with emphasis. “What makes you ask such a question as that?” “I thought it queer that he should have given you such a handsome present.” “It was certainly very generous in him,” said Herbert. “I shouldn\u0027t think you\u0027d want to accept it, though.” “Why not?” “Because you are a poor boy and it don\u0027t correspond with your position.” “Perhaps not; but that don\u0027t trouble me.” “A less expensive boat would have been more appropriate.” “Perhaps it would; but you wouldn\u0027t have me refuse it on that account?” James did not answer and Herbert asked: “Are you going out in your boat this afternoon?” “I should like to try yours,” said James. “I shall be glad to have you,” said Herbert, politely. “And you may take mine,” said James, with unwonted politeness. “All right.” The two boys got into the boats and pulled out. James was charmed with the new boat. In every way it was superior to his own boat, apart from its being newer. It was certainly very provoking to think that a boy like Herbert Carter, poor almost to beggary, should own such a beautiful little boat, while he, a rich man\u0027s son, had to put up with an inferior one. “I say, Herbert,” he began, when they returned, “don\u0027t you want to exchange your boat for mine?” “Not much; I should be a fool to do that.” “I don\u0027t mean even, for I know your boat is better. I\u0027ll give you five dollars to boot.” “No, thank you; there\u0027s a good deal more than five dollars\u0027 difference between your boat and mine.” “Five dollars would come handy to a poor boy like you,” said James, in his usual tone of insolent condescension. “I don\u0027t want it enough to exchange boats.” “Well, I\u0027ll give you ten dollars,” said James. “That\u0027s an offer worth thinking about.” “I shan\u0027t need to think about it. I say no.” “You\u0027ve got an extravagant idea of your boat. Mine is nearly as good but I\u0027ve taken a fancy to yours. How will you trade, anyway?” “I don\u0027t feel at liberty to trade at all. Mr. Cameron gave me the boat, but he is to have the use of it while he is here. He wouldn\u0027t be willing to have me exchange.” “He can have the use of it all the same if it is mine.” “It won\u0027t do, James,” said Herbert, shaking his head. “You are very foolish, then,” said James, disappointed. “I may be, but that is my answer.” James walked away. He made up his mind, since he could not have Herbert\u0027s boat, to tease his father to buy him a new one. As to rowing in an inferior one, his pride would not permit it.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2977/82066.html","bookId":346,"book":{"id":346,"title":"Herbert Carter\u0027s Legacy","description":"简介： Horatio Alger, Jr., an author who lived among and for boys and himself remained a boy in heart and association till death, was born at Revere, Mass., January 13, 1834.
