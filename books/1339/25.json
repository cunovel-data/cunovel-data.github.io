{"id":16577,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXII THE EVACUATION OF PETERSBURG","content":"The happy day was not distant when the husband and father of our little family was to be restored to his own home and his own people. I never inquired the source from which John drew his materials for a festival; but, a day or two before my husband was to arrive, he appeared with a small duck! This he roasted to perfection, to be served cold, as the hour for the dinner could not be determined in advance. We were all expectation and excitement when a lady drove up rapidly and asked for shelter, as she had been \"driven in from the lines.\" Shelter I could give by spreading quilts on the parlor floor—but, alas, my duck! Must my precious duck be sacrificed upon the altar of hospitality? I unlocked the little tin safe to assure myself that I could manage to keep it hidden, and behold, it was gone! Not until next day, when it was placed before my husband with a triumphant flourish (our unwelcome guest had departed), did I discover that John had stolen it! \"Why, there\u0027s the duck!\" I exclaimed. \"Course here\u0027s the duck,\" said John, respectfully. \"Ducks got plenty of sense. They knows as well as folks when to hide.\" 339 We found our released prisoner pale and thin, but devoutly thankful to be at home. Mr. Connolly and the officers around us called in the evening, keenly anxious to hear his story, and heartily expressing their joy at his release. My friends in Washington had wished to send me some presents, but my husband declined them, accepting only two cans of pineapple. Mr. Connolly sent out for the \"boys in the yard\" and assisted me in dividing the fruit into portions, so each one should have a bit. It was served on all the saucers and butter-plates we could find, and Mr. Connolly himself handed the tray around, exclaiming, \"Oh, lads! It is just the best thing you ever tasted!\" Then each soldier brought forth his brier-root and gathered around the traveller for his story. His story was a thrilling one—of his capture, his incarceration, his comrades; finally, of the unexpected result of the efforts of his ante-bellum friends, Washington McLean and John W. Forney, for his release. It was ascertained by these friends in Washington that he was detained as hostage for the safety of some union officer whom the Confederate government had threatened to put to death. Mr. McLean and Colonel Forney first approached General Grant. The General positively refused to grant their request. Then Mr. McLean visited Mr. Stanton. He found Mr. Stanton in the library of his own home, with his daughter in his arms, and the following conversation ensued:— \"This is a charming fireside picture, Mr. Secretary! I warrant that little lady cares nothing for war or the Secretary of War! She has her father, and that fills all her ambition.\" 340 \"You never said a truer word, did he, pet?\" pressing the curly head close to his bosom. \"Well, then, Stanton, you will understand my errand. There are curly heads down there in old Virginia, weeping out their bright eyes for a father loved just as this pretty baby loves you.\" \"Yes, yes! Probably so,\" said Stanton. \"Now—there\u0027s Pryor—\" But before another word could be said the Secretary of War pushed the child from his knee and thundered:— \"He shall be hanged! Damn him!\" But he had reckoned without his host when he supposed that Washington McLean would not appeal from that verdict. Armed with a letter of introduction from Horace Greeley, Mr. McLean visited Mr. Lincoln. The President remembered General Pryor\u0027s uniformly generous treatment of prisoners who had, at various times, fallen into his custody, especially his capture at Manassas of the whole camp of Federal wounded, surgeons and ambulance corps, and his prompt parole of the same. Mr. Lincoln listened attentively, and, after ascertaining all the facts, issued an order directing Colonel Burke, the commander at Fort Lafayette, to \"deliver Roger A. Pryor into the custody of Washington McLean.\" Armed with this order, Mr. McLean visited Fort Lafayette, where he found his friend in close confinement in the casemate with other prisoners. At that time John Y. Beall, a Confederate officer, was confined with General Pryor, under sentence of 341 death as a spy. Mr. McLean became interested in his fate, and suggested that if General Pryor would make a personal appeal in his behalf to President Lincoln, his execution might probably be prevented. To that end, Mr. McLean telegraphed a request to Mr. Lincoln, that he accord General Pryor an interview, to which a favorable response was promptly returned. The next evening, General Pryor, with Mr. McLean and Mr. Forney, called at the White House, and was graciously received by the President. General Pryor at once opened his intercession in behalf of Captain Beall; but, although Mr. Lincoln evinced the sincerest compassion for the young man, and an extreme aversion to his death, he felt constrained to yield to the assurance of General Dix, in a telegram just received, that the execution was indispensable to the security of the Northern cities—it being believed, though erroneously, that Captain Beall was implicated in the burning of the New York hotels. Mr. Lincoln then turned the conversation to the recent conference at Hampton Roads, the miscarriage of which he deplored with the profoundest sorrow. He said that had the Confederate government agreed to the re?stablishment of the union and the abolition of slavery, the people of the South might have been compensated for the loss of their negroes and would have been protected by a universal amnesty, but that Mr. Jefferson Davis made the recognition of the Confederacy a condition sine qua non of any negotiations. Thus, he declared, would Mr. Davis be responsible for every drop of blood that should be shed in the further prosecution 342 of the war, a futile and wicked effusion of blood, since it was then obvious to every sane man that the Southern armies must be speedily crushed. On this topic he dwelt so warmly and at such length that General Pryor inferred that he still hoped the people of the South would reverse Mr. Davis\u0027s action, and would renew the negotiations for peace. Indeed, he declared in terms that he could not believe the senseless obstinacy of Mr. Davis represented the sentiment of the South. It was apparent to General Pryor that Mr. Lincoln desired him to sound leading men of the South on the subject. Accordingly, on the General\u0027s return to Richmond, he did consult with Senator Hunter and other prominent men in the Confederacy, but with one voice they assured him that nothing could be done with Mr. Davis, and that the South had only to wait the imminent and inevitable catastrophe. The inevitable catastrophe marched on apace. Agnes wrote from Richmond, March 28—the last letter I received from the Confederate capital:— \"I do hate to write you bad news just now when you should be so happy with our dear General, but, really and truly, I don\u0027t at all like the looks of things here. Sheridan is at Ashland. And General Sherman has finished up North Carolina, and is in Virginia! \"I made an excursion through some of the Main Street stores last week—and recognized some of Mrs. Davis\u0027s things. I learned that she had placed a great many articles at the dry-goods stores for sale and had sold her horses. And now comes the surprising news, that she has left the city with her family. What does all this mean? 343 Some of the girls here have taken their jewellery to the Treasury Department, giving it to help redeem the currency. I am sure they are welcome to all mine!\" On the morning of April 2 we were all up early that we might prepare and send to Dr. Claiborne\u0027s Hospital certain things we had suddenly acquired. An old farmer friend of my husband had loaded a wagon with peas, potatoes, dried fruit, hominy, and a little bacon, and had sent it as a welcoming present. We had been told of the prevalence of scurvy in the hospitals, and had boiled a quantity of hominy, and also of dried fruit, to be sent with the potatoes for the relief of the sick. My husband said to me at our early breakfast:— \"How soundly you can sleep! The cannonading was awful last night. It shook the house.\" \"Oh, that is only Fort Gregg,\" I answered. \"Those guns fire incessantly. I don\u0027t consider them. You\u0027ve been shut up in a casemate so long you\u0027ve forgotten the smell of powder.\" Our father, who happened to be with us that morning, said:— \"By the bye, Roger, I went to see General Lee, and told him you seemed to be under the impression that if your division moves, you should go along with it. The General said emphatically: \u0027That would be violation of his parole, Doctor. Your son surely knows he cannot march with the army until he is exchanged.\u0027\" This was a great relief to me, for I had been afraid of a different construction. 344 After breakfast I repaired to the kitchen to see the pails filled for the hospital, and to send Alick and John on their errand. Presently a message was brought me that I must join my husband, who had walked out to the fortification behind the garden. I found a low earthwork had been thrown up during the night still nearer our house, and on it he was standing. I have had, very lately, access to a Federal map of the intrenched lines in the immediate front of Petersburg, drawn by a major of engineers of the United States Army. There I find a double line of breastworks, protected by thirty-four forts sweeping around the city and embracing some six or eight miles of country beyond, on either side. Within the Federal line is a little thread of a line protected by lunettes and only two forts (for this map has quite a Chinese feeling), and these two are named by the enemy, Fort Gregg and Fort Baldwin—the latter our Battery 45. To my surprise I find the engineer had his eye on me all winter. Near together are certain dots—two for \"Turnbull\" (General Lee\u0027s headquarters), two for \"Green,\" two for \"Laighton,\" and four for \"Pryor,\" representing the dwelling, office, kitchen, and servants\u0027 quarter at Cottage Farm! I perceive from the map that the engineer knew all about us all the time. To return to the morning of April 2—my husband held out his hand and drew me up on the breastwork beside him. Negroes were passing, wheeling their barrows, containing the spades they had just used. Below was a plain, and ambulances 345 were collecting and stopping at intervals. Then a slender gray line stretched across under cover of the first earthwork and the forts. Fort Gregg and Battery 45 were belching away with all their might, answered by guns all along the line. While we gazed on all this the wood opposite seemed alive, and out stepped a division of bluecoats—muskets shining and banners flying in the morning sun. My husband exclaimed: \"My God! What a line! They are going to fight here right away. Run home and get the children in the cellar.\" When I reached the little encampment behind the house, I found the greatest confusion. Tents were struck and a wagon was loading with them. Captain Glover rode up to me and conjured me to leave immediately. I reminded him of his promise not to allow me to be surprised. \"We are ourselves surprised,\" he said; \"believe me, your life is not safe here a moment.\" Tapping his breast, he continued, \"I bear despatches proving what I say.\" I ran into the house and gathered my little children. I bade the servants remain. If things grew warm, they had the cellar, and perhaps their presence would save their own goods and mine, should the day go against us. Uncle Frank immediately repaired to the cellar. \"I have only one order,\" I told the rest, \"hide the General\u0027s flag.\" As I left (bareheaded, I could not find my hat), I heard Uncle Frank call from the little portholes of his retreat to his wife, \"For Gawd\u0027s sake, Jinny, bring me a gode of water.\" 346 The morning was close and warm, and as we toiled up the dusty road I regretted the loss of my hat. Presently I met a gentleman driving rapidly from town. It was my neighbor, Mr. Laighton. He had removed his wife and little girls to a place of safety and was returning for me. He proposed, as we were now out of musket range, that I should rest with the children under the shade of a tree, and he would return to the farm to see if he could save something—what did I suggest? I asked that he would bring a change of clothing for the children and my medicine chest. As we waited for his return some terrified horses dashed up the road, one with blood flowing from his nostrils. When Mr. Laighton finally returned, he brought news that he had seen my husband, that all the cooked provisions were spread out for the passing soldiers, and that more were in preparation; also that he had promised to take care of me, and to leave the General free to dispense these things judiciously. John had put the service of silver into the buggy, and Eliza had packed a trunk, for which he was to return. This proved to be the French trunk in which Eliza sent a change of clothing. We were all soon in the buggy and on our way to town. \"Where shall I take you?\" asked Mr. Laighton. I had no answer ready. I thought I would trust to chance for an invitation. But we found the streets full of refugees like ourselves, and like ourselves, uncertain of shelter. Very few of our friends 347 had remained in the city after the siege had proven to be a permanent one. After a while, as we drove slowly through the crowded streets, we met Mr. Stuart, my husband\u0027s tailor. He said a good house had been left vacant by one of his customers, who had authorized him to rent it. \"I now rent it to General Pryor,\" said Mr. Stuart, and he conducted us to the door of a residence near my old home on Washington Street. When the door-bell was answered he informed a man whom he addressed as Robert, that we had become his master\u0027s tenants, and said that Robert and his mother, now in the house, would not be required to leave, adding:— \"Take good care of this lady. I will see that your wages are paid and that you are suitably rewarded.\" The silver service was dumped down in the front porch, and there we awaited events. About noon John appeared. He had saved something!—my champagne glasses! He had also brought a basket of biscuits. I sent him back to the farm, strictly ordering that the flag should be cared for. John told me it was safe. He had hidden it under some fence rails in the cellar. As to the battle, he had no news, except that \"Marse Roger is giving away everything on the earth. All the presents from the farmer will go in a little while.\" My next envoy from the seat of war was Alick, who walked into the yard, leading Rose by a rope, and at once proceeded to stable her. Go back? 348 No, marm, not if he knew his name was Alick. His mammy had never borned him to be in no battle! And walking off to give Rose a pail of water, he informed her that \"You\u0027n me, Rose, is the only folks I see anywhar \u0027bout here with any sense.\" Neighbors soon discovered us; and to my joy I found that Mrs. Gibson, Mrs. Meade, and Mr. Bishop—one of my father\u0027s elders—were in their own houses, very near my temporary shelter. Our father, I learned afterwards, was with the hospital service of his corps, and had been sent to the rear. The hospitals under Dr. Claiborne were ordered off early in the day, a significant indication of General Lee\u0027s accurate estimate of the probabilities of the hour. Dr. Claiborne had three thousand sick and wounded men to move. Among them was Colonel Riddick, from Smithfield, the brother of the spirited girl I had known there. She had come to Petersburg to nurse her wounded brother, and had left, in a wagon, with the hospital train. Part of this train was captured, and the wagons were ordered to be burned; but Miss Riddick positively refused to leave her seat, and as they could not burn the wagon with her in it, she was suffered to proceed with her brother in her own equipage. Miss Riddick was not a young lady who need fear. \"There\u0027s a divinity doth hedge\" some women. She was courteously treated and passed through the lines to her friends. Sketch of Entrenched Lines in Front of Petersburg View larger image In the evening the little boys came in with confidential news. The day had gone against us; 349 the city was to be surrendered after the retreat of the army at midnight. Their father would come in with the last. I remembered with anguish that I had lost my chance to save the important papers of the family. In a trunk in my room I had locked all my one lover\u0027s beautiful letters, all the correspondence—so rich I had meant to print it—of his residence in Greece, of his travels in the East and in Egypt; all the letters from statesmen and authors of the years preceding the struggle. There they were. They would be sport for the enemy in a few hours. My eldest son, Theodorick, and Campbell Pryor, my husband\u0027s twelve-year-old brother, agreed to return to the farm, draw the trunk out to the rear of the kitchen, break it open, set fire to the contents, and not leave until they were consumed. In due time the boys returned, having accomplished the burning of the letters, but bearing between them a huge bundle—a sheet full of papers. \"Father\u0027s sermons,\" explained Campbell. When the time came for my tired little brood to go to bed, I found three upper rooms prepared for us. In one of these I put the boys, first placing the large silver tray between two mattresses. A hamper filled with soiled towels and pinafores stood in a corner. Therein I bestowed the six pieces of the service, covering the whole with the soiled linen. A smaller room I reserved for my husband, into which I locked him, putting the key in my pocket—for he had returned in such an excited frame of mind, and in such physical exhaustion, that I was 350 uneasy about him, lest he might, when the army passed, yield to his feelings and go along with it. Then I took my seat at the window and listened. The firing had all ceased. A ring at the door-bell startled me. There stood Mayor Townes, come to ask if General Pryor would go out with the flag of truce and surrender the city. \"Oh, he cannot—he cannot,\" I declared. \"How can you ask him to surrender his old home? Besides, he is worn out, and is now sleeping heavily.\" About two o\u0027clock, General Lee passed the house with his staff. It is said he looked back and said to his aide: \"This is just what I told them at Richmond. The line has been stretched until it snapped.\" Presently there was a loud explosion—another—another. The bridges were being blown up. Then fires announced the burning of warehouses of tobacco. And then! As the dawn broke, I saw the Federal pickets entering silently, watchfully. Finding no resistance, they threw their muskets over into the yard and hurried down town to plunder! I awoke my boys. \"Get up, boys! Dress quickly. Now remember, you must be very self-controlled and quiet, and no harm will come to you.\" Immediately the door of my room was thrown wide open, and Robert ushered in three armed, German-looking soldiers. \"What do you want?\" I asked. \"To search the house,\" they answered. \"You will find nothing worth your while. There is my shawl! I have just run in from the lines. Here are my children.\" 351 \"We don\u0027t want your clothes,\" said one; \"we want your prisoner.\" My husband had heard and knocked at his door. He had not undressed. \"Here I am,\" he said, coming out and fastening his collar; and, before I could think, they had marched him off. I was left alone with the boy Robert, who had betrayed him. He stood trembling, not with fear—with excitement. \"Leave this house!\" I ordered him. \"What for?\" he asked sullenly. \"Because you are no friend of mine. This is now my house. You are not to set foot in it again.\" Strange to say, he left. He had admitted into the house more soldiers than these three. I had brought with me from the farm a little negress, Lizzie, who had been hired by Eliza \"to amuse the baby.\" Lizzie had obeyed the instinct which always leads a child\u0027s Southern nurse to the kitchen, and had gone below with my baby. I heard the most tremendous stamping and singing in the basement kitchen, and from the top of the staircase I called to Lizzie, who ran up, frightened, with the child in her arms. A soldier looked up from the bottom. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked. \"Getting breakfast,\" he replied. \"You\u0027ll get none here,\" I told him. He set his bayonet forward and started up the steps. I slipped back and luckily found a bolt on the door. Quick as thought I bolted him out. 352 But I was burningly indignant. I saw the street full of troops standing, and a young officer on horseback. I ran out and said to him:— \"Is it your pleasure we should be murdered in our houses? My kitchen is full of soldiers.\" \"Where, where?\" exclaimed the young fellow, dismounting and running in. I conducted him to the bolted door, unfastened it, and had the satisfaction of seeing him lay about with the flat of his sword to good purpose. He placed a guard around the house. Moreover, his action sustained me in my position, and the old woman in the kitchen greeted me respectfully, apologized for her son, and promised faithful service in the future. But another and most bitter trial was in store for me. An approaching army corps was hailed with shouts and cheers as it passed down the street. At its head was borne the trophy that had aroused this enthusiasm: our own sacred banner, given by the women of Petersburg to the young colonel at Smithfield, and inscribed with the names of the battles into which he had proudly borne it. It was coming back—a captive! How grateful I felt that my husband had not seen it! \"Ole Uncle Frank\u0027s at the bottom of that business,\" said Alick,—and alas! we had reason to suppose the polite old colored gentleman had purchased favor by revealing the hiding-place of our banner. My husband soon returned. He had presented Mr. Lincoln\u0027s card, on which the President had written his \"parole until exchanged.\" Thereafter he was arrested and released 353 every time the occupying troops moved and were replaced by new brigades and divisions. We sat all day in the front room, watching the splendidly equipped host as it marched by on its way to capture Lee. It soon became known that we were there. Within the next few days we had calls from old Washington friends. Among others my husband was visited by Elihu B. Washburne, and Senator Henry Wilson, afterward Vice-President of the United States with General Grant. These paid long visits and talked kindly and earnestly of the South. Major-General Warren had been relieved of his command and superseded by Sheridan. His old friend, Randolph Harrison, lay ill and wounded near us, and General Warren introduced himself to General Pryor and asked to be conducted to his friend\u0027s bedside. From that time he was with us every day, and, indorsed warmly by \"Ranny,\" our old friend, he too was admitted into our friendship. Mr. Lincoln soon arrived and sent for my husband. But General Pryor excused himself, saying that he was a paroled prisoner, that General Lee was still in the field, and that he could hold no conference with the head of the opposing army. The splendid troops passed continually. Our hearts sank within us. We had but one hope—that General Lee would join Joseph E. Johnston and find his way to the mountains of Virginia, those ramparts of nature which might afford protection until we could rest and recruit. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2763/76262.html","bookId":1339,"book":{"id":1339,"title":"Reminiscences of Peace and War","description":"简介： It will be obvious to the reader that this book affects neither the dignity of history nor the authority of political instruction.
