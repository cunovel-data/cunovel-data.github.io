{"id":16555,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II PRESIDENT PIERCE\u0027S INAUGURATION","content":"On the 4th of March, 1853, Franklin Pierce was inaugurated President of the United States. This was an exciting day for me. My husband had written articles for a Virginia paper which had won for him a place on the editorial staff of the Washington union, and was now in a position to break a lance with my friends, Messrs. Gales and Seaton. Mr. Pierce had liked his articles in the union, and sought his acquaintance. A friendship rapidly followed which was a happiness to us both. So when some member of the staff of the Democratic organ must be consulted about the inaugural address, the President had sent for my young husband and had taken counsel with him. I was delighted when I received an invitation from my good friends of the Smithsonian Institution to join them in a pleasant room opening on a balcony and overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, where we were to have a collation and witness the parade. My husband\u0027s sixteen-year-old sister, Fanny, was with me, and she was literally wild with delight. The rest of the party were Mr. and Mrs. Spencer Baird, little Lucy Baird, Mr. Gerard, and Mr. Turner. Little eight-year-old Lucy was the belle 16 of the occasion; so wise in scientific matters, knowing so much about \"specimens\" and \"extinct species\" that we felt ourselves heavy and ignorant beside her. \"Come now, Lucy,\" said Mr. Turner, \"I expect you to take care of me on this occasion. These are painful scenes for an Englishman. When you see the Continental troops coming, give me the wink, and I\u0027ll slip away and stir the punch. Those are the fellows who whipped the British!\" The elements frowned upon the change of administration. The sun was blanketed with dark clouds, from which the snow fell thickly—not a soft, enfolding snow, but snow driven by an angry wind. The crowd in the avenue was immense; swelled by the presence of the largest number of strangers ever before gathered at an Inauguration, the majority of whom were members of the mighty army of office-seekers from the party recently come into power. From the White House to the Capitol, windows, balconies, and roofs were thronged; and the sidewalks of the avenue were filled with a motley crowd of men, women, and children, foreigners, government clerks, and negroes. About twelve o\u0027clock the boom of a great gun announced the moving of the procession. The throng in the streets surged toward the gates of the Capitol, and \"lined up\" on either side awaiting the arrival of the cortège. Carriages filled with women and children, some of them with the emblazoned panels of foreign ministers, passed rapidly in advance of the cavalcade—the police actively engaged the while in keeping the waiting crowd 17 within bounds. Presently distant music was heard, and a mighty cheer announced the near approach of the escort. Six marshals in gay scarfs led the procession. Then came the \"flying artillery,\" drawn by fifty or more horses. An interval, and then platoons of soldiers of diverse battalions filled square after square, and band after band of martial music mingled with the cheers of the crowd. We were all out now on the balcony, little Lucy keenly alert. Presently she touched Mr. Turner on his arm and he fled! The Continentals were passing. Following these, in an open carriage drawn by four fine horses, came our President: the youngest, handsomest President we had ever elected. As he neared our balcony we stood up, waved and cheered, and threw him flowers, and so winning in their enthusiasm were little Lucy (her mind being now quite at rest about Mr. Turner) and my own young sister, that the President rose and bared his head to us. A platform had been erected over the steps of the east wing, and on it was a table holding a Bible. The distinguished officials of the time were seated around this table, and beneath it the crowd pushed and scrambled and struggled for place within hearing. Instantly there was silence. The slender, almost boyish figure of our President approached the table, and with bared head under the falling snow stood for a moment surveying the crowd. His face was pale, and his countenance wore an expression of weary sadness. When he took the 18 oath he did not, as is the custom, use the word \"swear.\" Placing his left hand on the Bible without raising the book, he raised his right and, looking upward, \"affirmed\" that, God helping him, he would be faithful to his trust. There were tears in his voice, but it was musical, and his enunciation was clear and distinct. Only two months before, his only child, a beautiful boy of thirteen, had been killed in a railroad collision—killed before his parents\u0027 eyes! His address began, \"My countrymen! It is a relief to feel that no heart but my own can know the personal regret and bitter sorrow over which I have been borne to a position so suitable for others rather than desirable for myself.\" The public does not tolerate the intrusion of a man\u0027s personal joys and griefs into his official life. However willing the world may be to sympathize, it considers this indicative of a mind lacking fineness and delicacy. To keep one\u0027s inner self in the background should be the instinct, and is surely the policy, of every man and woman who aspires to popularity. There were many who quickly criticised this unfortunate sentence of the President. The Whig journals sneered at it as \"a trick of the orator to awaken personal interest before proceeding to unfold his public policy.\" But he had the sympathetic tears of many of his audience. His address went on to discuss the annexation of Cuba—a dream which lasted through many subsequent years. The Pearl of the Antilles was ardently 19 coveted as a pendant to our chain of states, but she will never belong to us, unless as the result of more misfortune. The President then pledged himself to the never dying Monroe Doctrine, prayed appealingly for the preservation of our union, and touched upon the troubled questions which, despite all our wars and sufferings, are not yet fully settled. And then, amid cheers and shouts and salvos of artillery, he was driven to his new home, and it was all over. Three days after the inauguration the Cabinet nominations were sent to the Senate. Mr. Marcy was to be Secretary of State; Mr. Guthrie, Secretary of the Treasury; Jefferson Davis, of War; James Dobbin, of the Navy; Robert McClelland, of the Interior; James Campbell, Postmaster-General; Caleb Cushing, Attorney-General—four men from the North, three from the South. These, then, with their families, were to lead the social life of Washington for four years. The Executive Mansion, shrouded in gloom, could never become a social centre. We had the honor of knowing well the three most distinguished of these men, Mr. Marcy, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Cushing. Mr. Marcy, the best-known member of the Cabinet, strong, honest, and an adroit politician, was a man of rugged and abrupt manners, yet a great favorite with the ladies. We at once became keenly interested in his initial proceedings. He was sternly democratic in his ideas. Absorbing as were the cares of his department, exciting and menacing as 20 were the questions of the hour, he inaugurated his official life by settling matters of dress and etiquette—so far as they related to the presence of American envoys at foreign courts. President Jackson had been supposed to be democratic, but he was a bloated aristocrat beside Mr. Marcy. Jackson had rejected the prescribed court dress,—embroidered cuffs and cape, white breeches, gold knee-buckles, white silk stockings, gold shoe-buckles, chapeau-bras, cockade, eagle, white feather, and sword. Alackaday, that we should have lost all this bravery! Jackson decreed no cape at all (such a friendly fashion to laden shoulders), no embroidery except a gold star on the coat-collar,—but breeches and modest buckles, a sword, a chapeau-bras with eagle and cockade. Now why should Mr. Marcy make trouble by meddling with the cut of the garments of our representatives abroad—at a time, too, when such a number of serious questions were about to come before him; when filibusters were at work, a war with Spain imminent, treaties to be made with Mexico, and fishery questions to be settled with England? Simply, I suppose, because great men all over the world have condescended to prescribe in trifling matters—matters belonging to the chef, the milliner, the arbiter of fleeting fashions. It would seem that the greater the man the greater his appreciation of trifles. Everything to him is important—from the signing of a treaty to the tying of a shoestring. The consequences of Mr. Marcy\u0027s meddling were 21 far-reaching. On June 1, 1853, he issued a circular recommending that our representatives abroad should, in order to show their devotion to republican institutions, appear whenever practicable in the simple dress of an American citizen. Our Minister at Berne found the court of Switzerland quite willing to receive him in his citizen\u0027s dress. The Ministers at Turin and Brussels reported they would have no difficulty in carrying out the instructions of the State Department. The representative at Berlin was at once informed that such action would be considered disrespectful. The king of Sweden insisted on court dress at social functions. Mr. August Belmont, at The Hague, received a cold permission from the king to dress as he pleased—and it is recorded (as matter for gratitude on the part of the American Minister) that after all, and notwithstanding, the queen actually danced with him in his citizen\u0027s dress, and the king condescended to shake him by the hand and to talk with him! Mr. Mason, at the French court, could not face the music! He consulted his wife, and together they agreed upon a compromise. He appeared in an embroidered coat, sword, and cocked hat, and had the misfortune to receive from Mr. Marcy a severe rebuke. Mr. Buchanan, at the court of St. James, having no wife to consult, thought long and anxiously on the subject. The question was still unsettled at the opening of Parliament in February, 1854. Our Minister did not attend,—he had \"nothing to 22 wear,\"—whereupon \"there was quite a sensation in the House of Lords.\" \"Indeed,\" he wrote to Mr. Marcy, \"I have found difficulty in preventing this incident from becoming a subject of inquiry and remark in the House of Commons.\" Think of that! At a time when England was on the eve of a war with Russia, all the newspapers, court officials, House of Commons, exercised about the dress of the American Minister! The London Times stated that on a diplomatic occasion \"the American Minister sate unpleasantly conscious of his singularity.\" The London Chronicle blamed General Pierce\u0027s republican ill manners, and the \"American puppyism,\" and continued: \"There is not the least reason why her Majesty should be troubled to receive the \u0027gentleman in the black coat\u0027 from Yankee-land! He can say his say at the Foreign Office, dine at a chop-house in King Street, sleep at the old Hummums, and be off as he came, per liner, when his business is done.\" Poor Mr. Buchanan, sorely pressed, conceived the idea of costuming himself like General Washington, and to that end examined Stuart\u0027s portrait. He may even have gone so far as to indulge in a private rehearsal—queue, powdered wig, and all; but he seems to have perceived he would only make himself ridiculous; so he took his life in his hands and—brave gentleman as he was—appeared at the queen\u0027s levee in the dress of an American citizen; and she, true lady as she was, settled the matter, for her court at least, by receiving him as she did all others. Mr. Buchanan wrote to his 23 niece, Miss Harriet Lane, \"I wore a sword to gratify those who yielded so much, and to distinguish me from the upper court servants.\" Mr. Soulé, at the court of Madrid, adopted the costume of Benjamin Franklin at the court of Louis XVI—sword, chapeau, black velvet, and much embroidery, looking, \"with his black eyes, black looks, and pale complexion, less like the philosopher whose costume he imitated than the master of Ravenswood.\" There had been a lively discussion among the Austrian and Mexican Ministers and the Countess of Montijo, the mother of the Empress Eugénie and of the Duchess of Alba, whether or no he should be rejected; but Mr. Soulé did not know this. The queen received him, he wrote to Mr. Marcy, \"with marked attention and courtesy.\" There is no telling whether this simple deviation from the prescribed court dress was not the real cause of Mr. Soulé\u0027s serious troubles at court. It was the Duke of Alba who provided the spark which fired the train of Spanish indignation against him and occasioned a quarrel which resulted in two duels and strained relations which were never reconciled. It is always dangerous to infringe upon accepted rules of etiquette, even in association with those who are themselves defiant of these rules. I discovered that Mr. Marcy was very jealous of respect due to himself, as well as to his government. He was a prime favorite, as I have said, with the ladies—and with none more than the charming 24 family of \"Father Ritchie,\" as we called one of Washington\u0027s most esteemed citizens. Mr. Ritchie had been editor for forty years of the Richmond Enquirer, which he had founded under the auspices of Thomas Jefferson, and made one of the most influential Democratic papers of the country. His home in Washington was noted for elegant hospitality. He lived next door to Mr. Corcoran on Lafayette Square, near St. John\u0027s Church. He had lovely daughters, and whenever Mr. Marcy appeared in the salons of the town, one or more of these ladies was sure to be with him. It so happened that some of us were much interested in a poor, worthy young man, who desired a position in the State Department. His application had long ago been filed in the office and we were afraid he had been forgotten. We longed to ask Mr. Marcy about it, but did not know how we could manage to bring the subject to his notice. \"Let\u0027s make Ann Eliza ask him,\" suggested one. Now, Ann Eliza Ritchie was a beauty, as fascinating a young creature as the Lord ever made, irresistible alike to man and woman. She hesitated,—everybody was afraid of Mr. Marcy—but goaded on by us, she ventured:— \"Oh, Mr. Marcy\" (Virginia girls always begin with \"Oh\"), \"Oh, Mr. Marcy! They all want to know if you are going to appoint Mr. Randolph in your department.\" The lion turned. He did not growl, he simply roared: \"What do you mean, madame? How 25 dare you take the bull by the horns in this unseemly manner?\" And so no more of Ann Eliza Ritchie. And so no more of the rest of us. We learned a lesson we never forgot; namely, not to meddle in Cabinet affairs, but to content ourselves with the honor of amusing great men,—in short, to know our place and keep it. Mr. Jefferson Davis had been an eminent public man long before the presidency of Mr. Pierce. He was a graduate of West Point. He had been an officer in the Indian wars. He was in the House of Representatives at the age of thirty-seven. John Quincy Adams heard his maiden speech and said: \"That young man is no ordinary man. He will make his mark yet, mind me.\" His devotion to reading and study amounted to a passion. He had served as a colonel in the Mexican War. It was said of him that \"his brilliant movement at Buena Vista carried the day, and that his tactical conception was worthy of a C?sar or a Napoleon.\"[2] He was afterward a member for four years of the United States Senate, and although defeated in a gubernatorial contest in Mississippi, he rose rapidly in the esteem of the people of his own section; and now, at the age of forty-five, he was the \"leader of the Southern people, and successor of John C. Calhoun.\" He was leader a few years later in the Battle of the Giants, fought so bitterly in Mr. Buchanan\u0027s time. 26 Of Mr. Caleb Cushing I knew less than I did of Mr. Davis and Mr. Marcy. He had great learning, great ability, wide experience in public life. He has been described as a \"scholar, author, lawyer, statesman, diplomatist, general, and judge.\" He was one of the rare class of men who are precocious in childhood and youth, and who go intellectually from strength to strength as long as they live. He was graduated from Harvard when only seventeen years of age. He was a most attractive man in manner and address, and a fascinating public speaker. He could quote the \"Iliad\" from beginning to end, and could speak to each one of the foreign ambassadors in his own tongue. Mr. Cushing sent an editorial nearly every day to the Washington union, of which my husband was associate editor. No compliment upon his own articles which my husband ever received was more gratefully appreciated than one from Mr. Cushing. A serious difference of opinion had arisen with the senior editor, because of a paper upon the Anglo-Russian war, in which my husband warmly advocated the side of Russia. He declined retracting his words (which were copied and translated abroad), and finally gave up his position on the paper rather than express sentiments other than his own. Mr. Cushing applauded him, and bade him stand fearlessly by an argument, \"unanswered and unanswerable.\" Shortly after this Mr. Pierce appointed my husband special Minister to Greece. I longed to go with him to Athens, but my mother\u0027s health was 27 frail, and I felt I could not leave her. So I returned to my home in Virginia with my children, and their father went on his mission alone. When it was accomplished, the Pierce administration was drawing to a close. My temporary home was near Charlottesville, and thither, on his way South, came the President to spend a day and to visit Monticello, the home of the Father of Democracy. He wrote to me, inviting me to spend the evening with him and a few friends at his hotel. We had a delightful evening. He told me all I wished to know of the exile far away in Greece, expressed warm friendship for him and his, and presented me with two gorgeous volumes, bound sumptuously in green morocco, and inscribed, from my \"friend Franklin Pierce,\" in his own fine handwriting. I played at his request, he sitting the while beside the piano. I selected Henselt\u0027s \"L\u0027Elisire d\u0027Amour\" and \"La Gondola,\" to the great delight of the President. The other day I read, from the pen of some irreverent critic, of the \"lilting puerilities of the innocuous Henselt.\" All the same, these puerilities pleased the President, and will charm the world until the end of time. I feel that I have said too little of Mr. Pierce in this sketch of the men we knew. I cannot hope to convey an adequate conception of his captivating voice and manner. Surely its source was in genuine kindness of heart. I knew nothing of him as a politician. It was urged against him that he was extremely partial to the South. I know the South 28 honored and loved him always. It was said that \"Franklin Pierce could not say \u0027No\u0027\"—a weakness which doubtless caused him a world of trouble in his political relations, but to which he may have owed something of the indescribable charm for which he was conspicuous. Mr. Seward, his political opponent, wrote to his wife: \"The President has a very winning way in his manners.\" I can fully understand the beautiful friendship between him and Nathaniel Hawthorne. How exquisite the answer of the author when chidden because he had dedicated a book to the President, after the latter had become unpopular: \"Unpopular, is he? If he is so exceedingly unpopular that his name is enough to sink the volume, there is so much the more need that an old friend should stand by him.\" Hawthorne had then arrived at the height of his own popularity, while his friend, on account of his fancied Southern sympathies, had lost the friendship of his own people. A bitter lot for a sensitive patriot, who had done his best! \"An angel can no more!\" My residence in Washington during the Pierce administration was too short to afford me more than a brief glimpse of the social life of the city, but I keenly enjoyed that glimpse. I had the good fortune to find favor, as I have said, with the old residents, and also with the Hon. W. W. Corcoran, at whose house the best of the old and new could always be found. There I met many distinguished people. I remember especially General Winfield Scott, Sam 29 Houston, and Washington Irving. General Scott, grand, imposing, and ceremonious, never failed to tell everybody that he had been groomsman for my husband\u0027s father—he had been born in Petersburg, Virginia. He addressed all young women as \"fair lady.\" He was a great hero and a splendid old fellow in every particular, and he never for a moment forgot his heroism and his splendor. People called him \"vain.\" So great a man could not be accused of vanity—\"the food of fools.\" He had a reasonable pride in what he had achieved, but his was certainly not the kind of pride that apes humility. As for old Sam Houston, he had had romance enough in his past life for a dozen heroes. He had lived many years among the Indians, had fought in many wars, had achieved the independence of Texas—what had he not done? Now he was Senator from Texas, very popular, and rather impatient, one might judge, of the confinement and restraints of his position. It was amusing to see the little pages of the Senate Chamber providing him with small bundles of soft pine sticks, which he would smuggle into his desk with a rather shamefaced expression. Doubled up over this desk, his face almost covered with his hanging eyebrows and iron-gray whiskers, he occupied himself in whittling sticks as a safety-valve for unrest while listening to the long speeches, lasting sometimes until midnight. He would prove afterward in his brilliant conversation that he had not lost a word. Sometimes the pine under his knife would take shape in little crosses, amulets, etc. He was known, 30 now and then, to draw from the pocket of his tiger-skin vest an exquisitely carved heart and present it to some young lady whose beauty attracted him. Then there was Washington Irving,—an old man with but a few years to live. He died before the end of the next administration. One would never think him old,—so keen and alert was he,—but for his trick of suddenly falling asleep for a minute or two in the middle of a conversation. A whisper, \"Sh-h-h,\" would pass from one to another, \"Mr. Irving is asleep;\" and in a moment he would wake up, rub his hands, and exclaim, \"Well, as we were saying,\" taking up the conversation just where he had left it. My little sister worshipped Mr. Irving. \"Only let me see him,\" she pleaded; \"only let me touch the hand that wrote the \u0027Sketch Book.\u0027\" I repeated this when I introduced her, and he said: \"Ah, yes, yes! I know! I have heard all that before—many times before. And just as I am getting happy over it, here comes a young fellow, some whipper-snapper who never wrote a line, and [mimicking] it\u0027s \u0027Good evening, Mr. Irving, I am glad to have met you.\u0027\" It happened that my sister had not heard. She was already distraite. Her favorite friend had appeared, and she at once echoed, \"Good evening, Mr. Irving, I am glad to have met you,\" to the old gentleman\u0027s infinite delight and amusement. I was proud to have had even a word with \"America\u0027s most celebrated writer: exquisite in courtesy and fidelity and of lofty purity of character.\" He died in 1859—the 31 heart which had ached so long for the death of an early love failing him suddenly at \"Sleepy Hollow,\" his home on the Hudson. His country scarcely noticed his death! That country, crazed on the subject of slavery, was writing columns on columns about John Brown. One morning, when I was passing the corner of Fifteenth Street, below President Square, my steps were arrested by a large crowd which had assembled in front of the bank of Corcoran \u0026 Riggs. \"Dear me,\" I thought, \"has the bank failed?\" But the green blinds of the plain two-storied building were all open, and presently through the opening door, escorted by Mr. Riggs himself, came a slight little maid in a Connemara cloak and hood. Mr. Riggs put her in a waiting carriage, slammed the door, and, with a look which said plainly to the waiting crowd, \"No more this time,\" re?ntered the house. The little lady was Adelina Patti—just sixteen—and Mr. Riggs\u0027s guest during the few days she spent in Washington on her way to meet Southern engagements. Congressmen tendered her a complimentary benefit, and she sang in a small hall, supported by a few local musicians. She stood before us in a simple muslin slip, her dark hair bound with a narrow blue velvet ribbon,—a Scottish \"snood,\"—and never, in all her brilliant life, was she more appreciated, more admired. I could remember a time of musical dearth in Virginia, relieved only by rare occasions when the dimly lighted concert rooms would be filled by eager listeners to wandering minstrels: the Hutchinson 32 family, Anna Bishop, the Orpheans, Parodi, and Amalia Patti. After a while Strakosch appeared with an infant phenomenon. She looked precisely like a French doll, with her little round face, pink cheeks, and big black eyes, dressed in short frocks of rose-color or blue silk. But she sang like a linnet on a bough; and it was comical to see her in her duets inclining her small head toward her contralto, after the manner of other divas. This was the ten-year-old Adelina Patti! \"What does she keep in her throat?\" asked a little girl near her own age—adding comfortably, \"Never mind, we will find out when she dies!\" Maurice Strakosch accompanied her on a square piano placed upon the floor, the platform being often too narrow to admit it. He played, frequently turning his face to the audience, nodding and smiling, as if to say:— \"See this little marvel I have discovered! Is she not a darling?\" The midget had an uncertain temper in those days. Travelling once in the same car with a lady who took her fancy, she found an opportunity to free her mind of her opinion of her troupe: Amalia was jealous of her; Amalia would shake and pinch her behind the scenes if the audience applauded her; Strakosch was utterly horrid—just observe his great hands! Not for worlds would she sing for him were it not for the sugar-plums! At the end of the journey Strakosch approached the little girl and held out his hand to take her to her sister. 33 \"I am not going with you,\" said Adelina, \"I am going home with this lady.\" \"Ah, but impossible!\" said Strakosch. \"I will!\" said the small rebel. \"You know I always do things when I say \u0027I will.\u0027\" \"Why not?\" said the lady (she was Mrs. Glasgow, the lovely mother of Ellen Glasgow, the authoress). \"Why not? Let her come with me! I will take good care of her.\" Strakosch shrugged his shoulders. A scene was imminent. \"If I consent, Adelina,\" he said at last, \"will you be sure to be ready when I come for you for rehearsal? Will you be sure to sing?\" \"Will you be sure to bring me back?\" \"Sure—I promise.\" \"How much candy?\" was the next excited question. \"A whole pound.\" \"No—not enough!\" \"Two pounds,\" said Strakosch, glancing around to satisfy himself that the scene attracted admirers and possible concert goers. \"Not enough,\" persisted Adelina, shaking her head. \"A hatful!\" cried Strakosch, and won the day. Mrs. Glasgow devoted herself to the little girl for the four days of her stay. On the last evening she invited ten or fifteen child neighbors to a dolls\u0027 party with Adelina Patti. At the end of the evening she said: \"Now, Adelina, these little girls have been very kind to you. They have brought you lovely flowers—I wish you to sing one little song for them.\" 34 A shrewd look possessed the tiny face. \"Sing—for—them! Sing without money! Mais non! J\u0027ai toujours beaucoup des fleurs.\" She disappeared for a while from public view. I saw her no more until her visit to Washington. Later, if I may anticipate, during Mr. Buchanan\u0027s administration, she made her début in \"Lucia di Lammermoor.\" People fought for seats and boxes. Three rival beauties secured the three best—tiny, comfortless stalls—at ninety dollars each. It was something to see Miss Harriet Lane, Mrs. John R. Thompson, and Mrs. Stephen A. Douglas in those three boxes! Each was filled with beautiful women, and the Cabinet officers and Senators stood behind. \"What is all this about?\" asked Judge Douglas, the \"Little Giant.\" \"The opera follows Scott\u0027s \u0027Bride of Lammermoor,\u0027\" I gently suggested. \"Whose bride was she? Where did she live?\" asked the mighty man, the famous Senator who came so near being President. \"I doubt whether she lived at all,\" I told him. \"She is a creature of pure imagination, I\u0027m afraid.\" \"Oh!\" said the Senator, contemptuously, and gave no more attention to the stage nor to the divine artist upon it. As I had come to Washington from Virginia, where everybody\u0027s great-grandfather knew my great-grandfather, where the rules of etiquette were only those of courtesy and good breeding, I had many a troubled moment in my early Washington life, lest I should transgress some law of precedence, etc. I 35 wisely took counsel with one of my \"old residents,\" and she gave me a few simple rules whereby the young chaperon of a very young girl might be guided: \"My dear,\" said this lady, \"My dear, you know you cannot always have your husband to attend you. It will be altogether proper for you to go with your sister to morning and afternoon receptions. When you arrive, send for the host or the master of ceremonies, and he will take you in and present you. Of course, your husband will take you to balls; if he is busy, you simply cannot go! I think you would do well to make a rule never, under any circumstances, to drive in men\u0027s carriages. There are so many foreigners here, you must be careful. They never bring their own court manners to Washington. They take their cue from the people they meet. If you are high and haughty, they will be high and haughty. If you are genially civil but reserved, they will be so. If you talk personalities in a free and easy way, they will spring some audacious piece of scandal on you, and the Lord only knows where they\u0027ll end.\" Now, it so happened that I had just received a request from a Frenchman who had brought letters, to be allowed to escort Madame and Mademoiselle to a fête in Georgetown. We were to drive through the avenue of blossoming crab-apples, and rendezvous at a spring for a picnic. I forget the name of our hostess, but she had arranged a gay festival, including music and dancing on the green. I had accepted this invitation and the escort of M. Raoul, and received a note from him asking at what hour 36 he should have the honor, etc., and I immediately ran home and wrote that \"Madame would be happy to see M. Raoul à trois heures\"—and that Madame asked the privilege of using her own horses, etc. I made haste to engage an open carriage and congratulated myself on my clever management. The afternoon was delicious. Monsieur appeared on the moment, and we waited for my carriage. The gay equipages of other members of the party drove up and waited for us. Presently, rattling down the street, came an old ramshackle \"night-hawk,\" bearing the mud-and-dust scars of many journeys, the seats ragged and tarnished, raw-boned horses, with rat-eaten manes and tails, harness tied with rope,—the only redeeming feature the old negro on the box, who, despite his humiliating entourage, had the air of a gentleman. What could I do? There was nothing to be done! Monsieur handed me in without moving a muscle of his face, handed in my sister, entered himself, and spoke no word during the drive. He conducted us gravely to the place of rendezvous, silently and gravely walked around the grounds with us, silently and gravely brought us home again. I grew hot and cold by turns, and almost shed tears of mortification. I made no apology—what could I say? Arriving at my own door, I turned and invited my escort to enter. He raised his hat and, with an air of the deepest dejection, dashed with something very like sarcastic humility, said he trusted Madame had enjoyed the afternoon—thanked 37 her for the honor done himself—and only regretted the disappointment of the French Minister, the Count de Sartiges, at not having been allowed to serve Madame with his own state coach, which had been placed at his disposal for Madame\u0027s pleasure! As he turned away my chagrin was such I came near forgetting to give my coachman his little \"tip.\" I began, \"Oh, Uncle, how could you?\" when he interrupted: \"Now, Mistis, don\u0027t you say nothin\u0027. I knowed dis ole fune\u0027al hack warn\u0027t fittin\u0027 for you, but der warn\u0027t nar another kerridge in de stable. De boss say, \u0027Go \u0027long, Jerry, an\u0027 git \u0027er dar!\u0027—an\u0027 I done done it! An\u0027 I done fotch \u0027er back, too!\" I never saw M. Raoul afterward. There\u0027s no use crying over spilt milk, or broken eggs, or French monsieurs, or even French counts and Ministers. I soon left for Virginia, and to be relieved of the dread of meeting M.
