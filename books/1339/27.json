{"id":16579,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV SHERIDAN\u0027S OCCUPATION OF PETERSBURG","content":"Such alarming rumors reached us from the neighboring counties, of marauding parties plundering private houses and frightening defenceless women, that my husband obtained an extension of his parole, and permission to visit his sisters in Nottoway County. He had not heard from his father since the fight at Cottage Farm. Leaving me in the care of my neighbor, good Mr. Bishop, he set forth. The first stirring event of our new position was the arrival of prisoners, marched through the streets under a strong guard. They were a forlorn body of ragged, hatless, barefoot men. They had found poles or sticks somewhere, and upon them they waved their hats and handkerchiefs—the poor, brave fellows! We women stood at the doors of our houses with smiles and encouraging words. One of the soldiers darted from the ranks, rushed to me, embraced me as if I were a sister, and slipped his watch into my hands! It was a novel experience; but I think if he had appeared as a prisoner in the garb of Beelzebub, horns, hoofs, and all, I should not have flinched. Within the watch I found his 362 name—a connection of our family and a valued friend. He had recognized me, but I could not recognize the elegant young colonel in his impersonation of a ragged barefoot boy. My little sons soon found the destination of the captives, also that citizens were getting permits from headquarters to take them home. \"Then you must go and ask General Hartsuff for a permit,\" I said. Upon inquiry it appeared that this could not be done by proxy. Some adult member of the family must apply in person. So I took my young escorts with me, and we went to \"Centre Hill,\" the fine Bolling House, where the General had made his headquarters. I presented my plea. How many did I want? I thought I could take care of eight. Their names? I could give only one, the owner of the watch. The General kindly conceded that I might select my men, adding, \"Would to God I could release them all!\" The first impression I had of the temporary prison was of stifling heat in which no one could live. The place smelt violently! My friend helped me choose my men, and I was required to present myself with them, armed with my order, to have my name and theirs entered in an army register, with an order that they report every day until the command moved on. As I was leaving the warehouse a fair-haired boy said to me, \"Oh, take me along too!\" \"Take my arm,\" I said; and not until I reached the street did I realize the enormity of my mistake. I had stolen a prisoner! 363 I knew well I could be severely punished. My boy soon told me his name. He was Frank Brooke, nephew of our dear Judge Randolph Tucker. But here was a dilemma. All night I revolved it in my mind. I had nine men—eight were to report next morning. Very early Alick knocked at my door. \"What is it now, Alick?\" \"One of dem prisoners run away las\u0027 night! I hear de do\u0027 open and jump up to see what\u0027s de matter. He say, \u0027Keep still, boy! Hit\u0027s all right!\u0027\" \"So it is, Alick,\" I said, \"it\u0027s perfectly delightful.\" I took a piece of my husband\u0027s silver service down to the Northern sutler, and pawned it for two hundred dollars. With this money I purchased shoes, handkerchiefs, and hats for my men, and kept them in comfort for a week or more. They were then \"moved on\" to other and distant quarters,—and all very soon liberated. One morning early I was summoned from my room by Alick, who informed me that four gentlemen had called. Descending to the parlor, I found four officers in Federal uniform. As soon as I entered, one of them asked brusquely:— \"How many rooms are in this house?\" \"I think there are eight or ten.\" \"General Sheridan wants the house for his adjutant\u0027s office.\" I was aware that General Sheridan had arrived 364 the day before, and had taken possession of Mr. Hamilton\u0027s elegant mansion on the next street, in the rear of my little dwelling. I at once perceived that the General, although in a house of twenty or more rooms, had not desired the noise and inconvenience of an adjutant\u0027s office under his own roof. I answered coldly:— \"I cannot oblige General Sheridan. My house is small. I need it for my own family.\" One of the officers rose, crossed the room, and, standing before me, said sternly:— \"Madam, you seem to be unaware that when General Sheridan sees a house that suits him, he knows how to make the terms for it.\" \"Ah, well,\" I replied, \"I had forgotten that fact for the moment. Do I understand my family must go in the street? How much time can you give me to remove them?\" The officers withdrew into the hall and conferred together. Presently one of them returned, and informed me courteously that they had concluded not to annoy me. He was aware he was addressing Mrs. General Pryor. His own name was Captain Lee, and he had been happy to spare me inconvenience. The next morning I was awakened soon after dawn by a tremendous hubbub below me, and sending my little maid, Lizzie, to ascertain the cause, she beckoned to me to come to the head of the stairs. I threw on my gown, thrust my feet into my carpet slippers, and peeped over the banister. Captain Lee was standing at the foot of 365 the stair, writing a note on the top of the newel post. Looking up, he saw me, and said: \"I was writing to you, Madam. General Sheridan has ordered us to take your house. It is a military necessity. I pray you will try to be patient, and I will do all I can to save you annoyance.\" \"How soon must I leave?\" \"Not at all! We can allow you two rooms—the one you already occupy and the one below it.\" I appreciated the concession of the latter room, and busied myself to make of it dining room and sitting room. I brought beds from a rear room to my own chamber, for the lodging of my family. Alick was positively stricken at the new turn things had taken; but I represented to him and to the boys the grave necessity, in their father\u0027s absence, of discreet and always courteous behavior. To add to my embarrassment, John brought in several hundred books he had picked up on the farm. They were dumped down in a pile in the corner of my reception room. The weather was intensely hot. It was impossible to sit with closed doors. I locked the doors of my bedroom during the day, and all the family, except myself, lived in the yard under my eyes, unless the rain drove them within. The first night of our captivity I had sent my baby with her small nurse to bed. Hearing a heavy step overhead, I ran up to my room. Standing in an easy attitude, leaning on the mantel, was a large negro man. He was smoking a cigar and talking to Lizzie. 366 \"What is your business here?\" I asked. \"Only my pleasure—to pass away a little time.\" \"Look at me!\" The negro raised his eyes with an insolent smile. Slowly and with emphasis I said:— \"Do you leave this room instantly! And mark well my words. If ever you enter it again, I shall KILL you!\" He left, and alas, alas! my poor little Lizzie, whom I had hired from her mother, left also; and not by me or by her friends was she ever seen again! Only those who have lived in an adjutant\u0027s office can know the ceaseless noise, turmoil, tramping to and fro, loud talking night and day. There was no night. The gas (which they left me to pay for) burned brightly all night. Officers were coming in for orders day and night. I never knew to what use the upper rooms were put; I only know they were rarely silent. All the business of a great army was transacted here, that the General\u0027s entertaining, his elegant life, his sleep, might be undisturbed. The sentry was drawn so closely around my doors that I could never enter the yard or garden without passing them. Finally, upon going out to the little vine-clad summer-house to give my baby air—I cannot say fresh air—one of the sentinels shook my equilibrium by informing me as I passed:— \"We\u0027ve caught Jeff Davis.\" When I returned, my eyes cast down to avoid him, he stepped close to me and hissed in my ear, \"He shall be hanged.\" 367 Mr. Davis had not then been arrested, but this I did not know. Leaving my baby with her brothers, I walked straight into the veranda of Mr. Hamilton\u0027s house, asked for General Sheridan, was ushered into a room where a number of officers were sitting around a table, and announced myself. \"I am Mrs. Pryor, whose house you have taken for an adjutant\u0027s office. Sentinels have been placed around my house who insult me when I cross the threshold.\" General Sheridan rose: \"What can we do for you, Madam? What do you demand?\" \"That the sentry around my house be removed to the street enclosure.\" I was invited to take a seat, but I preferred standing while an order was made out. I have often smiled to think what I must have looked like to those officers. My gown was of chocolate-colored percale, with a white spot. Enormous hoops were then in fashion. I had long since been abandoned by mine. I fancy I resembled nothing so much as the wooden Mrs. Noah who presides over the animals in the children\u0027s \"Noah\u0027s Arks.\" I took the order given me, bowed my thanks, and walked through a line of soldiers home. After this I had the larger liberty my children needed. It was my custom, in these days of my captivity, to descend early, that I might guard my books, to my little reception room. A dining room it did not become for a long time afterward. I had nothing whatever to eat except the biscuits brought me by Mr. Bishop, and a daily tray sent at noon by my 368 angel friend, Mrs. Meade. She had some Northern men boarding with her and could command such fare as the sutler was willing to sell, for the farmers were as destitute of fresh food as ourselves. We had been excellent customers of a cigar shop in old times, and the proprietor now opened his establishment, and intrusted my boys and Campbell with a \"walking agency.\" They sold cigars at good profit to the officers and soldiers around us; and we made acquaintance once more with United States pennies and dimes. Sitting all day in my little reception room, I was cheered by visits from my friends, and occasionally the tenants of the house would ask for a glass of water from the sideboard. Captain Lee came often. He confided to me his chagrin at the manners of the Petersburg ladies. He had picked up a veil for a pretty girl, and she had turned away her head when her hand was extended to receive it. The Captain was deeply hurt: he was \"a Northern man, yes, but\" he was \"a gentleman.\" One day Captain Lee informed me that he had good news for me. \"We have marching orders! We go to-night! I know you are pleased! We have given you so much trouble!\" \"Not more, I suppose, than was necessary!\" \"Well, I must say, you have been very patient. General Sheridan is in the office and wishes to make his respects to you.\" The General entered and thanked me for the manner in which I had endured all the inconvenience to which he had subjected me. He seemed, for some 369 reason, to wish me to think well of his course toward us, and began to explain it. He alluded to the policy that he had adopted. \"It was the very best thing to do,\" he declared. \"The only way to stamp out this rebellion was to handle it without gloves.\" If he fancied I would either argue or agree with him, he mistook me. I was silent. There was an embarrassing pause, and he began to berate our government for bad management. \"Ladies should be better cared for,\" he said. \"Why, I assure you there was no necessity for your starving! I have unearthed, within forty miles of this place, enough provisions to keep you in perfect comfort.\" Looking down, he espied the brown eyes of my baby steadfastly fastened on his face. \"I think I must borrow this little lady,\" he said. \"It is not often General Sheridan has anything in his arms as sweet as this.\" He still had her in his arms as he turned to leave the room, and she gladly went with him. Presently she was brought back with a parcel in her own arms—figs, bananas, cakes, and nuts. Captain Lee came in late to bid me good-by, and to reiterate his thanks. \"You really have been so very nice! Now I am going to beg you will allow me to make some return.\" I hastened to accept his offer. I told him that my General\u0027s pet mare, Lady Jane, was in his command. She had been missing ever since the battles around Richmond. John was sure he had seen her. 370 By some chance she had fallen into the hands of the troops now in Petersburg. Could it be possible for me to reclaim her? The Captain looked grieved. \"No,\" he said; \"I had no thought of anything of that kind. But a great many ladies have asked for what I am going to give you. I have brought you General Sheridan\u0027s autograph.\" He instantly interpreted my disappointment. Before I could recover he added, \"But it appears you don\u0027t wish it,\" and threw it on the table. \"I can at least, Captain, be grateful that you tried to please me.\" That night the adjutant\u0027s office was closed. Next morning my husband returned. General Warren came in to see him. General Sheridan stood on our porch to receive the homage of his men, bowing to their cheers. General Warren looked on from our window. Presently the troops he had commanded when he was superseded by Sheridan passed the house. They saw their old commander, and the shouts, \"Hurrah for General Warren,\" must have been harsh sounds for General Sheridan. I was alone one afternoon in my accustomed seat, when a tall, lantern-jawed soldier with a musket on his shoulder marched in. \"I want some whiskey!\" he informed me. \"You\u0027ll not get it here!\" \"Wall, I guess you\u0027ll have to scare it up. I\u0027ll search the house.\u0027 \"Search away! I\u0027ll call the provost guard to help you,\" I said. 371 He turned and marched out. At the door he sent me a parting shot:— \"Wall! you\u0027ve got a damned tongue ef you ain\u0027t got no whiskey!\" My husband has always considered this a very good story. I forestall him by telling it myself! I grew very fond of General Warren. He spent many hours with us; tactful, considerate, and kind, he never grieved or offended us. One evening he silently took his seat. Presently he said:— \"I have news which will be painful to you. It hurts me to tell you, but I think you had rather hear it from me than from a stranger—General Lee has surrendered.\" It was an awful blow to us. All was over. All the suffering, bloodshed, death—all for nothing! General Johnston\u0027s army was surrendered to General Sherman in North Carolina on April 26. The banner which had led the armies of the South through fire and blood to victory, to defeat, in times of starvation, cold, and friendlessness; the banner that Helen\u0027s lover had waved aloft on a forlorn hope until it fell from his lifeless hands; the banner found under the dying boy at Gettysburg, who had smilingly refused assistance lest it be discovered,—the banner of a thousand histories was furled forever, with none so poor to do it reverence. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2763/76264.html","bookId":1339,"book":{"id":1339,"title":"Reminiscences of Peace and War","description":"简介： It will be obvious to the reader that this book affects neither the dignity of history nor the authority of political instruction.
