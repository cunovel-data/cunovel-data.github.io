{"id":16560,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII THE THIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS","content":"When the famous Thirty-sixth Congress met for its long session, December 5, 1859, the whole country was in ferment over the execution of John Brown. \"An indiscreet move in any direction,\" wrote ex-President Tyler from his plantation, \"may produce results deeply to be deplored. I fear the debates in Congress, and above all the Speaker\u0027s election. If excitement prevails in Congress, it will add fuel to the flame which already burns so terrifically.\"[5] He, and all patriots, might well have been afraid of increased excitement. It was evident from the first hour that the atmosphere was heavily charged. The House resolved itself into a great debating society, in which the only questions were: \"Is slavery right or wrong? Shall it, or shall it not, be allowed in the territories?\" The foray of the zealot and fanatic aggravated the fury of the combatants. The member from Mississippi—L. Q. C. Lamar (afterwards Supreme Court Justice of the United States)—threw an early firebrand by announcing on the floor of the House, \"The Republicans are not guiltless of the blood of John Brown, his co-conspirators, 94 and the innocent victims of his ruthless vengeance.\" Lawrence Keitt of South Carolina declared: \"The South asks nothing but its rights. I would have no more, but as God is my judge, I would shatter this republic from turret to foundation-stone before I would take a tittle less.\" Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania retorted: \"I do not blame gentlemen of the South for using this threat of rending God\u0027s creation from foundation to turret. They have tried it fifty times, and fifty times they have found weak and recreant tremblers in the North who have been affected by it, and who have acted from those intimidations.\" Such were a few, by comparison with those that rapidly followed, of the wild utterances of the hour. This occurred on the second day of the session. The House was in an uproar! Members from their seats crowded down into the aisles, and the clerk was powerless to preserve order. \"A few more such scenes,\" said one, \"and we shall hear the crack of the revolver and see the gleam of brandished blade.\" In this spirit Congress proceeded to ballot for its Speaker, and balloted for two months (until February 1), before Mr. Sherman was abandoned (having withdrawn his name) and a compromise effected by the election of Mr. Pennington, who represented neither extreme of party. During these two months everything was said that could be said to fan the flame. Hot disputes were accentuated by bitter personal remarks. One day a pistol accidentally fell from the pocket of a member from New York, and, thinking it had 95 been drawn with the intention of using it, some of the members were wild with passion, crying excitedly for the sergeant-at-arms, and turning the House into a pandemonium. John Sherman, who had been the unlucky bone of contention, made this remarkable statement: \"When I came here I did not believe that the slavery question would come up; and but for the unfortunate affair of Brown at Harper\u0027s Ferry I do not believe that there would have been any feeling on the subject. Northern men came here with kindly feelings, no man approving the foray of John Brown, and every man willing to say so, every man willing to admit it as an act of lawless violence.\" Four years before this stormy election, Banks had been chosen Speaker after a contest longer by a few days than this. Then, as now, slavery was the point at issue; but \"good humor and courtesy had marked the previous contest where now were acrimony and defiance.... Then threats of disunion were received with laughter; now they were too manifestly sincere to be treated lightly.\" In four years the breach between North and South, once only a rift in the rock, had become a yawning chasm. What might it not become in four years more? Not foreseeing the rapid change of public sentiment, the Democrats had, four years before, selected Charleston for the meeting of the convention to name their candidate for the presidency. Accordingly, on April 23, the party was convened in the \"hotbed of disunion.\" The Northern Democrats had heard much of the 96 splendor and elegance in which Charlestonians lived, and of the Arabian hospitality of the South, which could ignore all animosities over the bread and salt. But Charleston turned a cold shoulder to its guests from the North. All hearts, however, and all homes were opened to the Southerners. They dined with the aristocrats, drove with richly dressed ladies in gay equipages, and were entertained generally with lavish hospitality. All this tended to widen the breach between the sections. When the delegates left their fair entertainers for the sessions of the convention, the ladies repaired to old St. Michael\u0027s Episcopal Church, where prayers, specially ordered for the success and prosperity of the South, were daily offered. \"At the same time fervent abolition preachers at the North were praying for a disruption of the Charleston convention.\" Judge Douglas had written a platform that was not acceptable to the South. After its adoption seven delegates from Southern states declared their purpose of secession. The convention, seeing that it was impossible to reach any result, adjourned May 3, to meet at Baltimore the 18th of June. The seceders resolved to meet at Richmond the second Monday of May. This initial movement awakened the alarm of at least one devoted son of the South. Alexander Stephens wrote to a friend: \"The leaders intended from the beginning to rule or ruin.... Envy, hate, jealousy, spite—these made war in heaven, which made devils of angels, and the same passions will make devils of men. The Secession movement was instigated by nothing but bad passions. 97 Patriotism, in my opinion, had no more to do with it than love of God had with the other revolt.\"[6] In conversation with his friend Johnston, shortly after the adjournment of the Convention, Stephens said, \"Men will be cutting one another\u0027s throats in a little while. In less than twelve months we shall be in a war, and that the bloodiest in history. Men seem to be utterly blinded to the future.\"[7] The nomination of Lincoln and Hamlin on a purely sectional platform aroused such excitement all over the land, that the Senate and House of Representatives gave themselves entirely to speeches on the state of the country. Read at this late day, many of them appear to be the high utterances of patriots, pleading with each other for forbearance. Others exhausted the vocabulary of coarse vituperation. \"Nigger thief,\" \"slave driver,\" were not uncommon words. Others still, although less unrefined, were not less abusive. Newspapers no longer reported a speech as calm, convincing, logical, or eloquent,—these were tame expressions. The terms now in use were: \"a torrent of scathing denunciation,\" \"withering sarcasm,\" \"crushing invective,\" the orator\u0027s eyes, the while, \"blazing with scorn and indignation.\" Young members ignored the salutation of old Senators. Mr. Seward\u0027s smile after such a rebuff was maddening! No opportunity for scornful allusion was lost. My husband was probably the first Congressman to wear \"the gray,\" a suit of domestic cloth having been presented to him by his 98 constituents. Immediately a Northern member said, in an address on the state of the country, \"Virginia, instead of clothing herself in sheep\u0027s wool, had better don her appropriate garb of sackcloth and ashes.\" In pathetic contrast to these scenes were the rosy, cherubic little pages, in white blouses and cambric collars, who flitted to and fro, bearing, with smiling faces, dynamic notes and messages from one Representative to another. They represented the future which these gentlemen were engaged in wrecking—for many of these boys were sons of Southern widows, who even now, under the most genial skies, led lives of anxiety and struggle. Thoroughly alarmed, the women of Washington thronged the galleries of the House and the Senate Chamber. From morning until the hour of adjournment we would sit, spellbound, as one after another drew the lurid picture of disunion and war. Our social lines were now strictly drawn between North and South. Names were dropped from visiting lists, occasions avoided on which we might expect to meet members of the party antagonistic to our own. My friend Mrs. Douglas espoused all her husband\u0027s quarrels and distinctly \"cut\" his opponents. There were very few boxes to be had at our little theatre—and the three best were usually secured by Mrs. Douglas, Miss Harriet Lane, and Mrs. John R. Thompson. The feud between the President and Judge Douglas was bitter, and Mrs. Douglas never appeared at Miss Lane\u0027s receptions in the winter of 1859-1860. One evening we were all in our theatre boxes, Miss Lane 99 next to us, and I the guest of Mrs. Douglas. Mr. Porcher Miles, member from South Carolina, who had opposed Judge Douglas\u0027s nomination, appeared at the door of our box. Instantly Mrs. Douglas turned and said, \"Sir, you have made a mistake. Your visit is intended for next door!\" \"Madam,\" said Mr. Miles, \"I presumed I might be permitted to make my respects to Mrs. Pryor, for whom my call was intended.\" I had the benefit, of course, of the private opinions of each, and was able to be the friend of each. \"This, I suppose, is Southern chivalry,\" said my fair friend. \"It savors, I think, of ill-bred impertinence.\" \"I had supposed her a lady,\" said Mr. Miles, \"or at least a woman of the world. She behaved like a rustic—an ingénue.\" I could but receive their confidences in silence, perfectly well knowing that both were in the wrong. Both were betrayed by the mad passions of the hour—passions which caused older heads to misunderstand, mislead, and misbehave! \"I am the most unpopular man in the country,\" said Judge Douglas (one of the presidential candidates); \"I could walk from Boston to Chicago by the light of my own burning effigies,—and I guess you all know how much Virginia loves me.\" I had the good fortune to retain some of my Northern friends. The family of the Secretary of State was loyal to me to the end. When my husband was once embroiled in a violent quarrel, growing out of sectional feeling, General Cass sent his granddaughter, pretty Lizzie Ledyard (my prime favorite), with his love to bid me \"take heart,\" that 100 \"all would turn out right.\" Mrs. Douglas never abated one jot of her gentle kindness, although she knew we belonged to a party adverse to her husband. Mrs. Horace Clark\u0027s little brown ponies stopped as often as ever at my door to secure me for a drive down the avenue and a seat beside her in the House. She had been a Miss Vanderbilt and was now wife of a member from New York. All of them were prompt to congratulate me upon my husband\u0027s speech on \"the state of the country,\" and to praise it with generous words as \"calm, free from vituperation, eloquent in pleading for peace and forbearance.\" The evening after this speech was delivered, we were sitting in the library on the first floor of our home, when there was a ring at the door-bell. The servants were in a distant part of the house, and such was our excited state that I ran to the door and answered the bell myself. It was snowing fast, a carriage stood at the door, and out of it bundled a mass of shawls and woollen scarfs. On entering, a manservant commenced unwinding the bundle, which proved to be the Secretary of State, General Cass! We knew not what to think. He was seventy-seven years old. Every night at nine o\u0027clock it was the custom of his daughter, Mrs. Canfield, to wrap him in flannels and put him to bed. What had brought him out at midnight? As soon as he entered, before sitting down, he exclaimed: \"Mr. Pryor, I have been hearing about secession for a long time—and I would not listen. But now I am frightened, sir, I am frightened! Your speech in the House to-day gives me some hope. Mr. Pryor! I crossed the Ohio 101 when I was sixteen years old with but a pittance in my pocket, and this glorious union has made me what I am. I have risen from my bed, sir, to implore you to do what you can to avert the disasters which threaten our country with ruin.\" Never was a spring more delightful than that of 1860. The Marine Band played every Saturday in the President\u0027s grounds, and thither the whole world repaired, to walk, or to sit in open carriages, and talk of everything except politics. Easy compliments to the ladies fell from the lips of the men who could apply to each other in debate abuse too painful to remember. Sometimes we would be invited for the afternoon to sit on the veranda of the White House—and who could fail to mark the ravages of anxiety and care upon the face of the President! All the more because he insistently repeated that he was never better—that he slept finely and enjoyed the best health. Nevertheless, if one chanced to stand silently near him in a quiet corner, he might be heard to mutter, \"Not in my time—not in my time.\" Not in his time let this dear union be severed, this dear country be drowned in blood. On other afternoons we visited Mr. and Mrs. Robert E. Lee at Arlington, or drove out to Georgetown through the fragrant avenue of blossoming crab-apples, or to Mrs. Gales\u0027s delightful house for tea, returning in the soft moonlight. Everybody in Washington dined early. Congress usually adjourned at four o\u0027clock, and my little boys were wont to be on the roof of our house, to watch for 102 the falling of the flag over the House of Representatives, the signal that we might soon have dinner. The evening meal was late, usually handed. It was considered not \"stylish\" to serve it at a table. A servant would enter the drawing-room about eight o\u0027clock, with a tray holding plates and little doilies. Another would bring in buttered biscuits and chipped beef or ham, and a third tray held cups of tea and coffee. Some delicate sweet would follow. Little tables of Chinese lacquer were placed between two or more ladies, and lucky was the man who would be invited to share one of them. Otherwise he must improvise a rest for his plate on his trembling knees. \"Take care! Your plate will fall,\" I said to one. \"Fall! I wish it would—and break! The only thing that worries me is when the blamed thing takes to rolling. Why, I have chased plates all around the room until I thought they were bewitched or held the secret of perpetual motion!\" These suppers were very conversational, and one did not mind their being so light. There would be punch and sandwiches at eleven. Such were the pleasant happenings that filled our days—clouded now by the perils which we could not ignore after the warnings to which we listened at the Capitol. We were conscious of this always in our round of visits, receptions, dinners, and balls, with the light persiflage and compliments still in our ears. But when late evening came, the golden hour of reunion in the library on the first floor of our home was marked by graver talk. There would assemble 103 R. M. T. Hunter, Muscoe Garnett, Porcher Miles, L. Q. C. Lamar, Boyce, Barksdale of Mississippi, Keitt of South Carolina, with perhaps some visitors from the South. Then Susan would light her fires and show us the kind of oysters that could please her \"own white folks,\" and James would bring in lemons and hot water with some choice brand of old Kentucky. These were not convivial gatherings. These men held troubled consultations on the state of the country—the real meaning and intent of the North, the half-trusted scheme of Judge Douglas to allow the territories to settle for themselves the vexed question of slavery within their borders, the right of peaceable secession. The dawn would find them again and again with but one conclusion—they would stand together: \"Unum et commune periclum una salus!\" But Holbein\u0027s spectre was already behind the door, and had marked his men! In a few months the swift bullet for one enthusiast, for another (the least considered of them all), a glorious death on the walls of a hard-won rampart—he the first to raise his colors and the shout of victory; for only one, or two, or three, the doubtful boon of existence after the struggle was all over; for all survivors, memories that made the next four years seem to be the sum of life—the only real life—beside which the coming years would be but a troubled dream. The long session did not close until June, and in the preceding month Abraham Lincoln was chosen candidate by the Republican party for the presidency, 104 and Stephen A. Douglas by the Democrats. The South had also a candidate, and hoping to make things better, the ruffled-shirt gentry—the Old-Line Whigs—had also named their man. My little boys and I were glad to go home to Virginia. A season of perfect happiness awaited them, with their sisters and the dear old people whom they called grandfather and grandmother. Under the shade of the trees, and in the veranda covered with Lamarque roses, who could dream of war? In the hot and bitter campaign that ensued we are told that \"Douglas took the unusual course for a presidential candidate of visiting different parts of the country and discussing the political issues and their personal bearings. Speaking on all occasions, from the platform of the railroad car, the balcony of the hotel, at monster mass-meetings, he said much that was trivial and undignified, but he also said much that was patriotic, unselfish, and pregnant with constitutional wisdom. Coldly received at the South, where he was looked upon as a renegade, he aroused great enthusiasm at the North, and his personal presence was the only feature that gave any life to the struggle against the Republicans.\"[8] The words \"irrepressible conflict\" were much in evidence during this campaign. Seward adopted them, and made speeches characterized as his \"Irrepressible Conflict Speeches.\"[9] Seward reaffirmed almost everywhere the declaration of the \"irrepressible conflict,\" and when challenged because of the 105 term, he \"maintained that the Republicans simply reverted to the theory and practice of their fathers,\" giving no hint of a quotation. The authorship of these words has always been credited to Mr. Seward. Their true origin may be found in the address of Mr. Lincoln, delivered at Cincinnati, Ohio, in September, 1859. On page 262 of the volume published by Follett, Foster, \u0026 Co. in 1860, entitled \"Political Debates between Hon. Abraham Lincoln and Hon. Stephen A. Douglas,\" may be found the following extract from Mr. Lincoln\u0027s speech:— \"I have alluded in the beginning of these remarks to the fact that Judge Douglas has made great complaint of my having expressed the opinion that this Government \u0027cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.\u0027 He has complained of Seward for using different language, and declaring that there is an \u0027irrepressible conflict\u0027 between the principles of free and slave labor. [A voice: \u0027He says it is not original with Seward. That is original with Lincoln.\u0027] I will attend to that immediately, sir. Since that time, Hickman of Pennsylvania expressed the same sentiment. He has never denounced Mr. Hickman; why? There is a little chance, notwithstanding that opinion in the mouth of Hickman, that he may yet be a Douglas man. That is the difference! It is not unpatriotic to hold that opinion, if a man is a Douglas man. \"But neither I, nor Seward, nor Hickman is entitled to the enviable or unenviable distinction of having first expressed that idea. That same idea was expressed by the Richmond Enquirer in Virginia, in 1856, quite two years before it was expressed by the first of us. And while Douglas was pluming himself that in his conflict with my humble self, last 106 year, he had \u0027squelched out\u0027 that fatal heresy, as he delighted to call it, and had suggested that if he only had had a chance to be in New York and meet Seward he would have \u0027squelched\u0027 it there also, it never occurred to him to breathe a word against Pryor. I don\u0027t think that you can discover that Douglas ever talked of going to Virginia to \u0027squelch\u0027 out that idea there. No. More than that. That same Roger A. Pryor was brought to Washington City and made the editor of the par excellence Douglas paper, after making use of that expression, which in us is so unpatriotic and heretical.\" Before we returned to Washington Mr. Lincoln was elected President of the United States.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2763/76245.html","bookId":1339,"book":{"id":1339,"title":"Reminiscences of Peace and War","description":"简介： It will be obvious to the reader that this book affects neither the dignity of history nor the authority of political instruction.
