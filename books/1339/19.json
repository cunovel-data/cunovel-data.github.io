{"id":16571,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII THE SIEGE OF PETERSBURG","content":"June 9 will always be a sacred day to the citizens of Petersburg. Every man capable of bearing arms had enlisted early in the service of the Southern Confederacy. They felt that much was expected of them. Petersburg had behaved gallantly in 1776, and had been the \"Cockade City\" in 1812. For the first three years of the war, as we have seen, no gun was fired near her gates. Only old men, women, and children were left in the town. The maidens bore their denied lives with cheerfulness, sustained and encouraged by the steadfast and serene bearing of their elders. Everybody worked for the soldiers and assembled every afternoon to pray for them. The city was almost as quiet as Blandford, her sister city of the dead, where the old Blands, Bollings, and Poythresses slept in perfect peace. True, Petersburg, like Richmond, had her day of feverish excitement, known in Confederate history as \"Pawnee Sunday,\" when both cities had been menaced by an ironclad. Early in the morning a telegraph operator had relieved a dull hour by interviewing his colleague at City Point, \"Any danger from the Pawnee?\" receiving as answer, \"The 271 Pawnee is coming up the Appomattox.\" The town was wild. Everything valuable was hidden away, and the militia was drawn up, the lads of twelve and fourteen loading their hunting pieces and rallying to the town hall. Time having been allowed for any reasonable, well-conducted man-of-war to steam twelve miles, the telegraph operator, sorely pressed by questions, again interrogated his City Point friend. \"What\u0027s become of the Pawnee? She isn\u0027t here yet.\" The irate answer spun over the line: \"You—fool! I said the Pawnee is not coming up the river.\" Everything fell flat at once. There was an avowed sense of disappointment at the loss of an opportunity which might not come again. The dear women—the best I have ever known in any land—resumed their gentle ministrations, working much for the hospitals, and supplementing with culinary skill many deficiencies in material. But the men chafed. The veterans had felt the blood leap in their veins with the fire of youth; the boys longed for the fray; the physician, tied to his humdrum routine, yearned for the larger sphere in the field. \"The dearest sacrifice a man can make to his country is his ambition.\" The Pawnee incident was a fortunate one for the city, for it awakened the authorities to the necessity of preparing against surprise. The old, exempt citizens were formed into companies for home defence, and a breastwork was prepared commanding a road, \"particularly interesting,\" says one of the survivors, \"because it opened to deserving Petersburgers the beatific vision of Sussex hams and Southampton 272 whiskey;\" for at that moment the dreaded foe was the wolf already at the door, rather than the possible thunderbolt. When General Butler, in June, 1864, commenced his advance against Richmond, which was intended as a co?perative movement with General Grant to accomplish what was done the following spring, he sent General Kautz on June 9 to make a cavalry attack on Petersburg, twenty miles below Richmond. The city, as I have said, was almost defenceless. There had been much strategy,—marching and countermarching,—too long a story to tell here; but one thing at least was accomplished, as one of the Confederate colonels pithily remarked, \"Whatever blunders were made, the citizens and militia had been trotted out in the direction of the enemy at least.\" Kautz\u0027s superb cavalry appeared suddenly, was met by the old men and boys of Petersburg, and was repulsed. Colonel Fletcher Archer commanded the militiamen. Forewarned only a few minutes before the charge, he hastily formed his men into line. He says: \"And what a line! In number scarcely more than sufficient to constitute a single company, in dress nothing to distinguish them from citizens pursuing the ordinary avocations of life, in age many of them silvered over with the frosts of advancing years, while others could scarcely boast of the down upon the cheek of youth; in arms and accoutrements such as an impoverished government could afford them. But there was that in their situation which lifted them above the ordinary rules of criticism. They stood there, not as mercenaries who, 273 having enlisted on account of profit, required the strong arm of military law to keep them to their post, nor as devotees of ambition craving a place in the delusive pages of history, but they stood as a band of patriots whose homes were imperilled and whose loved ones were in danger of falling into the hands of an untried foe. As they stood in line before me I could see them glancing back at their own dwellings under the sun of a lovely June morning. When I addressed them in a few words of encouragement, they listened with gravity and a full appreciation of their situation. There was no excitement, no shout, only calm resolution.\" Thus their commander. What did the men themselves feel? One of them wrote: \"We had not long to wait. A cloud of dust in our front told of the hurried advance of cavalry, and the next moment the glitter of spur and scabbard revealed a long line of horsemen half a mile in front of us. Oh, how we missed our cannon! Our venerable muskets were not worth a tinker\u0027s imprecation at longer range than a hundred yards, and we were compelled perforce to watch the preparations for our slaughter, much after the fashion that a rational turtle may be presumed to contemplate the preliminaries of an aldermanic dinner.\" These were the men who saved the city. It was in honor of them that the women and children marched through dust and heat on June 9, 1866, to lay garlands of flowers upon their humble graves, and by their pious action to inaugurate the beautiful custom, which is now observed all over the country, 274 of honoring the dead who fell in the Civil War. No lovelier day ever dawned than June 9, 1864. The magnolia grandiflora was in full flower, bee-haunted honey-locusts perfumed the warm air, almost extinguishing the peachy odor of the microphylla roses, graceful garlands of jessamine hung over the trellised front porches. Almost the first intimation that the town received of its great peril was the impetuous dash through the streets of the Confederate artillery. The morning was so sweet and bright that the women and little children were abroad in the streets, on their way to market, or on errands to the shops, or to visit with fruit and flowers the old and sick among their friends. Lossie Hill, the daintiest of dainty maidens, was picking her leisurely way in the dusty street, going to spend the morning with old Mrs. Mertens, when she heard the frantic shout: \"Get out of the way! Damn the women! Run over them if they won\u0027t get out of the way.\" This was the morning greeting of the politest of gentlemen,—Captain Graham,—whose guns were thundering down the street to the rescue of the slender line at the front. As fast as the dread news reached the men exempt from duty, who were engaged in their various professions and vocations, every one dropped his business and rushed to the firing line. The oldest men were as ardent as the youngest. One man, a druggist, began, while pulling on his accoutrements, to give directions to a venerable clerk whom he expected to dispense drugs in his absence. \"Now,\" said the old man, \"if you want anything done at home you must talk to somebody 275 else! I am going to the front! I\u0027m just like General Lee. I should be glad if these fellows would go back to their homes and let us alone, but if they won\u0027t they must be made to, that\u0027s all.\" With their arms around their father, pretty Molly and Gussie Banister implored him not to go forth. He was president of the bank, he was frail and not young. \"The duty of every man lies yonder,\" said he, pointing to the puffs of smoke at the gates of the town, and shouldering his musket he marched away. Mr. William C. Banister was a cultivated, Christian gentleman, one of Petersburg\u0027s most esteemed and beloved citizens. His widow and sweet daughters received him—dead—on the evening of the battle. Molly Banister, one of the dear girls who blessed my life in those anxious days, has told the story of her martyred father\u0027s patriotic fervor:— \"My father had been on duty out on the lines on previous occasions, always against the entreaty of the members of his family. We thought his infirmity, deafness, ought to excuse him. Besides this, he was a bank officer and over military age. When the court-house bell, on the morning of the 9th of June, sounded the alarm, he was at his place of business, in the old Exchange Bank, and we hoped he would not hear it. He got information, however, of the condition of things, came at once home, and informed us of his purpose to go out to the lines. My mother and I besought him not to go, urging that he could not hear the orders. \"\u0027If I can\u0027t hear,\u0027 he said, \u0027I can fight—I can fire a gun. This is no time for any one to stand back. 276 Every man that can shoulder a musket must fight. The enemy are now right upon us.\u0027 \"Bidding us good-by he left the house. On the street, near our gate, was a man, just from the lines. Addressing him, my father said, pointing to the lines:— \"\u0027My friend, you are needed in this direction.\u0027 \"\u0027I am absent on leave,\u0027 said the man. \"\u0027No leave,\u0027 replied my father, \u0027should keep you on such an occasion as this. Every man should fight now!\u0027 \"I have been informed that as he came up from the bank he urged in the same way all whom he met, capable, as he thought, of bearing arms.\" Patty Hardee\u0027s father, another man past age for military service, was one of the first to report for duty, and among the first to be borne, dead, to his daughter. Robert Martin, also exempt, and the father of an adoring family, immediately joined the ranks. Almost totally deaf, he could hear no orders, and continued to load his gun after the order to cease firing was given and the company had begun to move off. A comrade ran up, put his lips to his ear, and remonstrated. \"Stop firing!\" exclaimed the veteran with disgust. \"Orders? I haven\u0027t heard any orders to stop firing,\" and he continued to advance. As Nelson at Copenhagen, who, when told that he had been signalled to stop fighting, turned his blind eye to the station, exclaiming, \"I see no signal!\" These are but a few of the many incidents which illustrate the courage of these stout-hearted veterans 277 and the spirit behind their small force which inspired that courage and compelled success. They fought—one hundred and twenty-five men, badly armed and untrained—behind their frail defence; one hundred and twenty-five against twenty-three hundred of the enemy, holding them at bay for two hours! General Butler was greatly chagrined at the failure of this move upon Petersburg. He sent a characteristic letter of reproof to his general officer north of the Appomattox. After detailing all the mistakes that had led to the humiliating repulse, he adds testily: \"You have endeavored to state in your report what my orders to General Kautz were. That was no part of your report. I know what my orders were without any information from that source,\" adding, \"certain it is that forty-five hundred of my best troops have been kept at bay by some fifteen hundred men, six hundred only of which were Confederate troops and the rest old men and boys, the cradle and the grave being robbed of about equal proportions to compose the force opposed to you.\" \"The cradle and the grave!\" Alas, yes! There was no triumph on the evening of that day. Half the gallant company was gone. There was wailing within the city gates that night. \"The hand of the reaper\" had taken \"the ears that were hoary,\" and the daughters wept for the good, gray head gone forward to the \"eternal camping ground\" after a long life of peace. For these gallant gentlemen the white rose which shaded my door yielded all its pure blossoms. Well was it for the sake of 278 my own devotion that this was an ever blooming rose! I had watered and nourished it with care, unconscious of its high vocation, to bud and blossom and lie on the noble heart of more than one soldier. My own husband was in the fight, and sent the first news of the repulse of the enemy and the safety of his boyhood\u0027s home. Immediately after the battle on the line, June 9, we observed unusual activity in our streets. Great army wagons passed continually, pausing often at a well before my door to water their horses. Clouds of dust filled the city. Evidently something unusual was going on. \"We are only re-enforcing our defences,\" we said, and comforted ourselves in the thought. One day my father came in unexpectedly. The army corps to which he was attached had camped near Petersburg! \"I\u0027ve just met General Lee in the street,\" he said. I uttered an exclamation of alarm. \"Oh, is he going to fight here?\" \"My dear,\" said my father, sternly, \"you surprise me! The safest place for you is in the rear of General Lee\u0027s army, and that happens to be just where you are! The lines are established just here, and filled with Lee\u0027s veterans.\" This was startling news, but more was to follow. One Sunday afternoon,—the next, I think,—the Presbyterian minister had gathered his flock of women and children for service in the church opposite my home, and had just uttered the first sentence 279 of his opening prayer, \"Almighty Father, we are assembled to worship Thee in the presence of our enemies,\" when an awful, serpentlike hiss filled the church, and a shell burst through the wall. In a moment the church was empty, and Dr. Miller, the pastor, was telling me that his congregation had dismissed itself without a benediction! \"And the shell?\" I inquired. \"It lies upon the table in the church,\" said the doctor; \"nobody dares remove it.\" This was the first shell that entered our part of the town. From that moment we were shelled at intervals, and very severely. There were no soldiers in the city. Women were killed on the lower streets, and an exodus from the shelled districts commenced at once. As soon as the enemy brought up their siege guns of heavy artillery, they opened on the city with shell without the slightest notice, or without giving opportunity for the removal of non-combatants, the sick, the wounded, or the women and children. The fire was at first directed toward the Old Market, presumably because of the railroad depot situated there, about which soldiers might be supposed to collect. But the guns soon enlarged their operations, sweeping all the streets in the business part of the city, and then invading the residential region. The steeples of the churches seemed to afford targets for their fire, all of them coming in finally for a share of the compliment. To persons unfamiliar with the infernal noise made by the screaming, ricocheting, and bursting 280 of shells, it is impossible to describe the terror and demoralization which ensued. Some families who could not leave the besieged city dug holes in the ground, five or six feet deep, covered with heavy timbers banked over with earth, the entrance facing opposite the batteries from which the shells were fired. They made these bomb-proofs safe, at least, and thither the family repaired when heavy shelling commenced. General Lee seemed to recognize that no part of the city was safe, for he immediately ordered the removal of all the hospitals, under the care of Petersburg\u0027s esteemed physician, Dr. John Herbert Claiborne. There were three thousand sick and wounded, many of them too ill to be moved. A long, never-ending line of wagons, carts, everything that could run on wheels, passed my door, until there were no more to pass. We soon learned the peculiar, deep boom of the one great gun which bore directly upon us. The boys named it \"Long Tom.\" Sometimes for several weeks \"Long Tom\" rested or slept—and would then make up for lost time. And yet we yielded to no panic. The children seemed to understand that it would be cowardly to complain. One little girl cried out with fright at an explosion; but her aunt, Mrs. Gibson, took her in her arms, and said: \"My dear, you cannot make it harder for other people! If you feel very much afraid, come to me, and I will clasp you close, but you mustn\u0027t cry.\" Charles Campbell, the historian, lived near us, at the Anderson Seminary. He cleared out the large coal cellar, which was fortunately dry, spread rugs 281 on the floor, and furnished it with lounges and chairs. There we took refuge when the firing was unbearable. Some of our neighbors piled bags of sand around their houses, and thus made them bomb-proof. The Rev. Dr. Hoge, who had come South from the Brick Church, New York, of which he had been pastor, was lying ill and dying a few miles from Petersburg, and my friend Mrs. Bland invited me to accompany her to visit him. She had borrowed an ambulance from General Bushrod Johnson. We made our call upon our sick friend, and were on our return when we were suddenly startled by heavy firing. The ambulance driver was much excited, and began to pour forth in broken English a torrent of abuse of the Confederacy. As we were near home, we kept silence, thinking that, if he grew more offensive, we could leave him and walk. Mrs. Bland undertook to reason with him. \"What is your grievance?\" she inquired. \"Perhaps we might see the colonel and arrange a better place for you—some transfer, perhaps.\" \"Nevare! nevare!\" said our man, \"I transfare to my own koontree! I make what you call—\u0027desairt.\u0027 Mon Dieu! dey now tell me I fight for neeger! Frenshman nevare fight for neeger.\" All this time the guns were booming away, and clouds of smoke were drifting toward us. We were glad to arrive at my door. It was closed. There was not a soul in the house. One of the chimneys had been knocked down, and the bricks lay in a heap on the grass. I thought of 282 Mr. Campbell\u0027s bomb-proof cellar; there we found my children, and there we remained until the paroxysmal shelling ceased. One night, after a long, hot day, we were so tired we slept soundly. I was awakened by Eliza Page, standing trembling beside me. She pulled me out of bed and hurriedly turned to throw blankets around the children. The furies were let loose! The house was literally shaking with the concussion from the heavy guns. We were in the street, on our way to our bomb-proof cellar, when a shell burst not more than fifty feet before us. Fire and fragments rose like a fountain in the air and fell in a shower around us. Not one of my little family was hurt. Another time a shell fell in our own yard and buried itself in the earth. My baby was not far away, in her nurse\u0027s arms. The little creature was fascinated by the shells. The first word she ever uttered was an attempt to imitate them. \"Yonder comes that bird with the broken wing,\" the servants would say. The shells made a fluttering sound as they traversed the air, descending with a frightful hiss, to explode or be buried in the earth. When they exploded in midair by day, a puff of smoke, white as an angel\u0027s wing, would drift away, and the particles would patter down like hail. At night, the track of the shell and its explosion were precisely similar in sound, although not in degree, to our Fourth of July rockets, except that they were fired, not upward, but in a slanting direction. I never felt afraid of them! I was brought up to believe in predestination. Courage, after all, is much 283 a matter of nerves. My neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Gibson and Mrs. Meade, agreed with me, and we calmly elected to remain in town. There was no place of safety accessible to us. Mr. Branch removed his family, and, as far as I knew, none other of my friends remained throughout the summer. Not far from the door ran a sunken street, with a hill, through which it was cut, rising each side of it. Into this hill the negroes burrowed, hollowing out a small space, where they sat all day on mats, knitting, and selling small cakes made of sorghum and flour, and little round meat pies. I might have been tempted to invest in the latter except for a slight circumstance. I saw a dead mule lying on the common, and out of its side had been cut a very neat, square chunk of flesh! With all our starvation we never ate rats, mice, or mule-meat. We managed to exist on peas, bread, and sorghum. We could buy a little milk, and we mixed it with a drink made from roasted and ground corn. The latter, in the grain, was scarce. Mr. Campbell\u0027s children picked up the grains wherever the army horses were fed. My little boys never complained, but Theo, who had insisted upon returning to me from his uncle\u0027s safe home in the country, said one day: \"Mamma, I have a queer feeling in my stomach! Oh, no! it doesn\u0027t ache the least bit, but it feels like a nutmeg grater.\" Poor little laddie! His machinery needed oiling. And pretty soon his small brother fell ill with fever. 284 My blessed Dr. Withers obtained a permit for me to get a pint of soup every day from the hospital, and one day there was a joyful discovery. In the soup was a drumstick of chicken! \"I cert\u0027nly hope I\u0027ll not get well,\" the little man shocked me by saying. \"Oh, is it as bad as that?\" I sighed. \"Why,\" he replied, \"my soup will be stopped if I get better!\" Just at this juncture, when things were as bad as could be, my husband brought home to tea the Hon. Pierre Soulé, General D. H. Hill, and General Longstreet. I had bread and a little tea, the latter served in a yellow pitcher without a handle. Mrs. Campbell, hearing of my necessity, sent me a small piece of bacon. When we assembled around the table, I lifted my hot pitcher by means of a napkin, and offered my tea, pure and simple, allowing the guests to use their discretion in regard to a spoonful or two of very dark brown sugar. \"This is a great luxury, Madam,\" said Mr. Soulé, with one of his gracious bows, \"a good cup of tea.\" We talked that night of all that was going wrong with our country, of the good men who were constantly relieved of their commands, of all the mistakes we were making. \"Mistakes!\" said General Hill, bringing his clenched fist down upon the table, \"I could forgive mistakes! I cannot forgive lies! I could get along if we could only, only ever learn the truth, the real truth.\" But he was very personal and used much stronger words than these. 285 They talked and talked, these veterans and the charming, accomplished diplomat, until one of them inquired the hour. I raised a curtain. \"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"the sun is rising. You must now breakfast with us.\" They declined. They had supped! I had the misfortune early in June to fall ill, with one of the sudden, violent fevers which cannot be arrested, but must \"run its course\" for a certain number of days. I was delirious from this fever, and wild with the idea that a battle was raging within hearing. I fancied I could hear the ring of the musket as it was loaded! Possibly my quickened senses had really heard, for a fierce battle was going on at Port Walthall, a station on the Richmond and Petersburg railroad, six miles distant. General Butler had landed at Bermuda Hundred and had been sent by General Grant to lead a column against Richmond on the south side of the James and to co?perate with forces from the Wilderness. Butler had reached Swift Creek, there to be met by General Johnson, and repulsed as far as Walthall Junction on the railroad. The following day there was a hotly contested battle at close quarters, continued on the next, when our men, although greatly outnumbered by Butler\u0027s forces, drove these back to their base on the James River. All this time my excited visions were of battle and soldiers, culminating at last by the presence of one soldier, leaning wearily on his sabre in my own room. I did not recognize the soldier, but memory still holds his attitude of grief as he looked 286 at me, and the sound of his voice as he answered my question, \"Where have you been all this time?\" with, \"In more peril than in all my life before.\" But the fever crisis was passing even then, and I was soon well enough to learn more. This was another of the well-planned schemes for taking Richmond, another of the failures which drew from Lincoln the gravely humorous reply, when application was made to him for a pass to go to Richmond:— \"I don\u0027t know about that; I have given passes to about two hundred and fifty thousand men to go there during the last two or three years, and not one of them has got there yet.\" Dr. Claiborne went out to this Walthall battle-field to help the wounded, taking with him surgeons and ambulances. A dreadful sight awaited him. Bodies of dead men, Federal and Confederate, lay piled together in heaps. On removing some of these to discover if any one of them might be still alive, a paper dropped from the pocket of a young lieutenant, written in German to a lady in Bremen. Upon reading it, Dr. Claiborne found it was addressed to his betrothed. He told her that his term of service having expired, he would soon leave for New York City, and he gave her the street and number where she should meet him on her arrival in this country. This was his last fight, into which he went no doubt voluntarily, as he was about to leave the army. Doubtless the blue-eyed M?dchen looked long for him on the banks of the Weser! The doctor indorsed the sad news on the letter, and sent it 287 through the lines. Perhaps it reached her, or perhaps she is telling her story this day to other blue eyes on the Weser, eyes that look up and wonder she could ever have been young, lovely, and the promised bride of a gallant union officer. The Confederate government utterly neglected the praise and distinction so freely awarded by other nations in time of war, for deeds of gallantry and valor. Says Major Stiles: \"Not only did I never see or hear of a promotion on the field, but I do not believe such a thing ever occurred in any army of the Confederacy from the beginning to the end of the war. Indeed, I am confident it never did; for, incredible as it may appear, even Lee himself did not have the power to make such promotion. I never saw or heard of a medal or a ribbon being pinned on a man\u0027s jacket, or even so much as a man\u0027s name being read out publicly in orders of gallantry in battle.\"[18] Hanging in my husband\u0027s library, among other war relics, is a heavy silver medal, representing in high relief a soldier charging a cannon. On the obverse side is a laurel wreath, space for a name, and the words, \"Distinguished for courage: U. S. Colored Troops.\" No such medal was ever given by our government to its hardly used, poorly paid private soldiers. Some of them fought through the war. They starved and froze in the trenches during that last dreadful winter, but no precious star or ribbon was awarded, to be hung with the sabre or musket and venerated by generations yet to come. 288 Among my few preserved papers I have two in faded ink. One is signed Bushrod Johnson, the other D. H. Hill. The latter says: \"The victory at Walthall Junction was greatly due to General Roger A. Pryor. But for him it is probable we might have been surprised and defeated.\" The other from General Johnson runs at length: \"At the most critical juncture General Roger A. Pryor rendered me most valuable service, displaying great zeal, energy, and gallantry in reconnoitring the positions of the enemy, arranging my line of battle, and rendering successful the operations and movements of the conflict.\" At General Johnson\u0027s request my husband served with him during the midsummer. Such letters I have in lieu of medal or ribbon,—a part only of much of similar nature; but less was given to many a man who as fitly deserved recognition. My General, who had been in active service in all the events around Petersburg, was now requested by General Lee to take with him a small squad of men, and learn something of the movements of the enemy. \"Grant knows all about me,\" he said, \"and I know too little about Grant. You were a schoolboy here, General, and have hunted in all the bypaths around Petersburg. Knowing the country better than any of us, you are the best man for this important duty.\" Accordingly, armed with a pass from General Lee, my husband set forth on his perilous scouting expedition, sometimes being absent a week at a time. One morning, very early, he entered my room. \"I am dead for want of sleep,\" he said. \"I was 289 obliged to take some prisoners. They are coming in under guard, and you must give them a good breakfast.\" As he walked out of the room to find a quiet corner, he called back, \"Be sure, now! Feed my prisoners, if all the rest of us lose our breakfast.\" He had suggested the only way in which he could be obeyed. Five forlorn blue-coated soldiers soon appeared, and lay down under the trees. Presently they were all asleep. I called my little family together. We had only a small pail of meal. Would they be willing to give it to these poor prisoners? They were willing, never fear; but I had trouble with John. He grew very sullen when I ordered him to bake the bread for Yankee prisoners in five small loaves. I promised to send out for more provisions later, and finally he yielded, but with an ill grace. When the hot loaves were on the table, flanked by sweetened corn-coffee, I deputed Paterson Gibson, my neighbor\u0027s kindly young son, to waken my guests. This was no easy matter. \"Come, now, Yank,\" said Pat, \"get up and eat your breakfast. Come now! Cheer up! We\u0027ll send you home pretty soon.\" We left them alone at their repast. It occurred to me they might try to escape, and I heartily wished they would. But after an hour they were marched away, we knew not whither. On July 30th occurred the dreadful explosion of the mine which the enemy had tunnelled under our line of fortifications. A little after four in the morning the city was 290 roused by the most awful thunder—like nothing I can imagine, except, perhaps, the sudden eruption of a volcano. This was the explosion of a mine tunnelled by General Grant under our works. Instantly the unhappy residents of the town poured into the street and out on the road, anywhere to escape what we supposed to be an earthquake. No words can adequately describe this horror! We lost a part of our line. Colonel Paul, a member of Beauregard\u0027s staff, was sent to inform General Lee of the disaster, and bore back his orders that the line must be at once recaptured. As the colonel passed his father\u0027s house, he ran in and found the old gentleman\u0027s hand on the bell-rope to summon his household to family prayers. \"Stay, my son, and join us at prayers,\" said the old man. \"Get some breakfast with your mother and me.\" The colonel could not pause. He must leave this peaceful home, and bear his part in protecting it. When the veterans meet to-day for their camp-fire talk, it is of the \"battle of the Crater,\" the shocking incidents of which cannot be told to gentle ears, that they speak most frequently. The fountain of fire that shot up to heaven bore with it the dismembered bodies of man made in God\u0027s own image. Then infuriated men, black and white, leaped into the chasm and mingled in an orgy of carnage. No one has ever built on that field. Nature smooths its scars with her gentle hand, but no dwelling of man will ever rest there while this tragedy is remembered. On May 3d, 1887, Federal and Confederate veterans 291 met on this spot and clasped hands together. Since then the Confederates have met there again and again. Each one has some story to tell of heroism, of devotion, and the stories are not always tragic. Some of them have been gleaned from the experiences of the boys in blue. Lieutenant Bowley of the Northern army delivered an address before the California commandery of the Loyal Legion of the United States, and quotes from the address of a negro preacher to his fellows just before the explosion of the crater. He was sergeant of a company of negroes, and thus exhorted them:— \"Now, men, dis is gwine to be a gret fight, de gretest we seen yit; gret things is \u0027pending on dis fight; if we takes Petersburg, mos\u0027 likely we\u0027ll take Richmond an\u0027 \u0027stroy Lee\u0027s army an\u0027 close de wah.
