{"id":44424,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 1: The Lost Child.","content":"\"My poor pets!\" a lady exclaimed, sorrowfully; \"it is too bad. They all knew me so well; and ran to meet me, when they saw me coming; and seemed really pleased to see me, even when I had no food to give them.\" \"Which was not often, my dear,\" Captain Ripon--her husband--said. \"However it is, as you say, too bad; and I will bring the fellow to justice, if I can. There are twelve prize fowls--worth a couple of guineas apiece, not to mention the fact of their being pets of yours--stolen, probably by tramps; who will eat them, and for whom the commonest barn-door chickens would have done as well. There are marks of blood in two or three places, so they have evidently been killed for food. The house was locked up last night, all right; for you see they got in by breaking in a panel of the door. \"Robson, run down to the village, at once, and tell the policeman to come up here; and ask if any gypsies, or tramps, have been seen in the neighborhood.\" The village lay at the gate of Captain Ripon\u0027s park, and the gardener soon returned with the policeman. \"I\u0027ve heard say there are some gypsies camped on Netherwood Common, four miles away,\" that functionary said, in answer to Captain Ripon. \"Put the gray mare in the dog cart, Sam. We will drive over at once. They will hardly expect us so soon. We will pick up another policeman, at Netherwood. They may show fight, if we are not in strength.\" Five minutes later, Captain Ripon was traveling along the road at the rate of twelve miles an hour; with Sam by his side, and the policeman sitting behind. At Netherwood they took up another policeman and, a few minutes later, drove up to the gypsy encampment. There was a slight stir when they were seen approaching; and then the gypsies went on with their usual work, the women weaving baskets from osiers, the men cutting up gorse into skewers. There were four low tents, and a wagon stood near; a bony horse grazing on the common. \"Now,\" Captain Ripon said, \"I am a magistrate, and I daresay you know what I have come for. My fowl house has been broken open, and some valuable fowls stolen. \"Now, policeman, look about, and see if you can find any traces of them.\" The gypsies rose to their feet, with angry gestures. \"Why do you come to us?\" one of the men said. \"When a fowl is stolen you always suspect us, as if there were no other thieves in the world.\" \"There are plenty of other thieves, my friend; and we shall not interfere with you, if we find nothing suspicious.\" \"There have been some fowls plucked, here,\" one of the policemen said. \"Here is a little feather--\" and he showed one, of only half an inch in length \"--and there is another, on that woman\u0027s hair. They have cleaned them up nicely enough, but it ain\u0027t easy to pick up every feather. I\u0027ll be bound we find a fowl, in the pot.\" Two of the gypsies leaped forward, stick in hand; but the oldest man present said a word or two to them, in their own dialect. \"You may look in the pot,\" he said, turning to Captain Ripon, \"and maybe you will find a fowl there, with other things. We bought \u0027em at the market at Hunston, yesterday.\" The policeman lifted the lid off the great pot, which was hanging over the fire, and stirred up the contents with a stick. \"There\u0027s rabbits here--two or three of them, I should say--and a fowl, perhaps two, but they are cut up.\" \"I cannot swear to that,\" Captain Ripon said, examining the portions of fowl, \"though the plumpness of the breasts, and the size, show that they are not ordinary fowls.\" He looked round again at the tents. \"But I can pretty well swear to this,\" he said, as he stooped and picked up a feather which lay, half concealed, between the edge of one of the tents and the grass. \"This is a breast feather of a Spangled Dorking. These are not birds which would be sold for eating in Hunston market, and it will be for these men to show where they got it from.\" A smothered oath broke from one or two of the men. The elder signed to them to be quiet. \"That\u0027s not proof,\" he said, insolently. \"You can\u0027t convict five men, because the feather of a fowl which you cannot swear to is found in their camp.\" \"No,\" Captain Ripon said, quietly. \"I do not want to convict anyone but the thief; but the proof is sufficient for taking you in custody, and we shall find out which was the guilty man, afterwards. \"Now, lads, it will be worse for you, if you make trouble. \"Constables, take them up to Mr. Bailey. He lives half a mile away. Fortunately, we have means of proving which is the fellow concerned. \"Now, Sam, you and I will go up with the Netherwood constable to Mr. Bailey. \"And do you,\" he said, to the other policeman, \"keep a sharp watch over these women. You say you can find nothing in the tents; but it is likely the other fowls are hid, not far off, and I will put all the boys of the village to search, when I come back.\" The gypsies, with sullen faces, accompanied Captain Ripon and the policeman to the magistrate\u0027s. \"Is that feather the only proof you have, Ripon?\" Mr. Bailey asked, when he had given his evidence. \"I do not think that it will be enough to convict, if unsupported; besides, you cannot bring it home to any one of them. But it is sufficient for me to have them locked up for twenty-four hours and, in the meantime, you may find the other fowls.\" \"But I have means of identification,\" Captain Ripon said. \"There is a footmark in some earth, at the fowl house door. It is made by a boot which has got hobnails and a horseshoe heel, and a piece of that heel has been broken off. \"Now, which of these men has got such a boot on? Whichever has, he is the man.\" There was a sudden movement among the accused. \"It\u0027s of no use,\" one of them said, when the policeman approached to examine their boots. \"I\u0027m the man, I\u0027ll admit it. I can\u0027t get over the boot,\" and he held up his right foot. \"That is the boot, sir,\" the constable exclaimed. \"I can swear that it will fit the impression, exactly.\" \"Very well,\" the magistrate said. \"Constable, take that man to the lockup; and bring him before the bench, tomorrow, for final committal for trial. There is no evidence against the other four. They can go.\" With surly, threatening faces the men left the room; while the constable placed handcuffs on the prisoner. \"Constable,\" Mr. Bailey said, \"you had better not put this man in the village lockup. The place is of no great strength, and his comrades would as likely as not get him out, tonight. Put him in my dog cart. My groom shall drive you over to Hunston.\" Captain Ripon returned with his groom to Netherwood, and set all the children searching the gorse, copses, and hedges near the common, by the promise of ten shillings reward, if they found the missing fowls. Half an hour later, the gypsies struck their tents, loaded the van, and went off. Late that afternoon, the ten missing fowls were discovered in a small copse by the wayside, half a mile from the common, on the road to Captain Ripon\u0027s park. \"I cannot bring your fowls back to life, Emma,\" that gentleman said, when he returned home, \"but I have got the thief. It was one of the gypsies on Netherwood Common. We found two of the fowls in their pot. No doubt they thought that they would have plenty of time to get their dinner before anyone came, even if suspicion fell on them; and they have hidden the rest away somewhere, but I expect that we shall find them. \"They had burnt all the feathers, as they thought; but I found a breast feather of a Spangled Dorking, and that was enough for me to give them in custody. Then, when it came to the question of boots, the thief found it no good to deny it, any longer.\" That evening, Captain Ripen was told that a woman wished to speak to him and, on going out into the hall, he saw a gypsy of some thirty years of age. \"I have come, sir, to beg you not to appear against my husband.\" \"But, my good woman, I see no reason why I should not do so. If he had only stolen a couple of common fowls, for a sick wife or child, I might have been inclined to overlook it--for I am not fond of sending men to prison--but to steal a dozen valuable fowls, for the pot, is a little too much. Besides, the matter has gone too far, now, for me to retract, even if I wished to--which I certainly do not.\" \"He is a good husband, sir.\" \"He may be,\" Captain Ripon said, \"though that black eye you have got does not speak in his favor But that has nothing to do with it. Matters must take their course.\" The woman changed her tone. \"I have asked you fairly, sir; and it will be better for you if you don\u0027t prosecute Reuben.\" \"Oh, nonsense, my good woman! Don\u0027t let me have any threats, or it will be worse for you.\" \"I tell you,\" the woman exclaimed, fiercely, \"it will be the worse for you, if you appear against my Reuben.\" \"There, go out,\" Captain Ripon said, opening the front door of the hall. \"As if I cared for your ridiculous threats! Your husband will get what he deserves--five years, if I am not mistaken.\" \"You will repent this,\" the gypsy said, as she passed out. Captain Ripon closed the door after her, without a word. \"Well, who was it?\" his wife inquired, when he returned to the drawing room. \"An insolent gypsy woman, wife of the man who stole the fowls. She had the impudence to threaten me, if I appeared against him.\" \"Oh, Robert!\" the young wife exclaimed, apprehensively, \"what could she do? Perhaps you had better not appear.\" \"Nonsense, my dear!\" her husband laughed. \"Not appear, because an impudent gypsy woman has threatened me? A nice magistrate I should be! Why, half the fellows who are committed swear that they will pay off the magistrate, some day; but nothing ever comes of it. Here, we have been married six months, and you are wanting me to neglect my duty; especially when it is your pet fowls which have been stolen. \"Why, at the worst, my dear,\" he went on, seeing that his wife still looked pale, \"they could burn down a tick or two, on a windy night in winter and, to satisfy you, I will have an extra sharp lookout kept in that direction, and have a watchdog chained up near them. \"Come, my love, it is not worth giving a second thought about; and I shall not tell you about my work on the bench, if you are going to take matters to heart like this.\" The winter came and went, and the ricks were untouched, and Captain Ripon forgot all about the gypsy\u0027s threats. At the assizes a previous conviction was proved against her husband, and he got five years penal servitude and, after the trial was over, the matter passed out of the minds of both husband and wife. They had, indeed, other matters to think about for, soon after Christmas, a baby boy was born, and monopolized the greater portion of his mother\u0027s thoughts. When, in due time, he was taken out for walks, the old women of the village--perhaps with an eye to presents from the Park--were unanimous in declaring that he was the finest boy ever seen, and the image both of his father and mother. He certainly was a fine baby; and his mother lamented sorely over the fact that he had a dark blood mark, about the size of a three-penny piece, upon his shoulder. Her husband, however, consoled her by pointing out that--as it was a boy--the mark did not matter in the slightest; whereas--had it been a girl--the mark would have been a disfigurement, when she attained to the dignified age at which low dresses are worn. \"Yes, of course, that would have been dreadful, Robert. Still, you know, it is a pity.\" \"I really cannot see that it is even a pity, little woman; and it would have made no great difference if he had been spotted all over, like a leopard, so that his face and arms were free. The only drawback would have been he would have got some nickname or other, such as \u0027the Leopard,\u0027 or \u0027Spotty,\u0027 or something of that sort, when he went to bathe with his school fellows. But this little spot does not matter, in the slightest. \"Some day or other Tom will laugh, when I tell him what a fuss you made over it.\" Mrs. Ripon was silenced but, although she said nothing more about it, she was grieved in her heart at this little blemish on her boy; and lamented that it would spoil his appearance, when he began to run about in little short frocks; and she determined, at once, that he should wear long curls, until he got into jackets. Summer, autumn, and winter came and passed. In the spring, Tom Ripon was toddling about; but he had not yet begun to talk, although his mother declared that certain incoherent sounds, which he made, were quite plain and distinct words; but her husband, while willing to allow that they might be perfectly intelligible to her, insisted that--to the male ear--they in no way resembled words. \"But he ought to begin to talk, Robert,\" his wife urged. \"He is sixteen months old, now, and can run about quite well. He really ought to begin to talk.\" \"He will talk, before long,\" her husband said, carelessly. \"Many children do not talk till they are eighteen months old, some not till they are two years. Besides, you say he does begin, already.\" \"Yes, Robert, but not quite plainly.\" \"No, indeed, not plainly at all,\" her husband laughed. \"Don\u0027t trouble, my dear, he will talk soon enough; and if he only talks as loud as he roars, sometimes, you will regret the hurry you have been in about it.\" \"Oh, Robert, how can you talk so? I am sure he does not cry more than other children. Nurse says he is the best child she ever knew.\" \"Of course she does, my dear; nurses always do. But I don\u0027t say he roars more than other children. I only say he roars, and that loudly; so you need not be afraid of there being anything the matter with his tongue, or his lungs. \"What fidgets you young mothers are, to be sure!\" \"And what heartless things you young fathers are, to be sure!\" his wife retorted, laughing. \"Men don\u0027t deserve to have children. They do not appreciate them, one bit.\" \"We appreciate them, in our way, little woman; but it is not a fussy way. We are content with them as they are, and are not in any hurry for them to run, or to walk, or to cut their first teeth. Tom is a fine little chap, and I am very fond of him, in his way--principally, perhaps, because he is your Tom--but I cannot see that he is a prodigy.\" \"He is a prodigy,\" Mrs. Ripon said, with a little toss of her head, \"and I shall go up to the nursery, to admire him.\" So saying, she walked off with dignity; and Captain Ripon went out to look at his horses, and thought to himself what a wonderful dispensation of providence it was, that mothers were so fond of their babies. \"I don\u0027t know what the poor little beggars would do,\" he muttered, \"if they had only their fathers to look after them; but I suppose we should take to it, just as the old goose in the yard has taken to that brood of chickens, whose mother was carried off by the fox. \"By the way, I must order some wire netting. I forgot to write for it, yesterday.\" Another two months. It was June, and now even Captain Ripon allowed that Tom could say \"Pa,\" and \"Ma,\" with tolerable distinctness; but as yet he had got no farther. He could now run about sturdily and, as the season was warm and bright, and Mrs. Ripon believed in fresh air, the child spent a considerable portion of his time in the garden. One day his mother was out with him, and he had been running about for some time. Mrs. Ripon was picking flowers, for she had a dinner party that evening, and she enjoyed getting her flowers, and arranging her vases, herself. Presently she looked round, but Tom was missing. There were many clumps of ornamental shrubs on the lawn, and Mrs. Ripon thought nothing of his disappearance. \"Tom,\" she called, \"come to mamma, she wants you,\" and went on with her work. A minute or two passed. \"Where is that little pickle?\" she said. \"Hiding, I suppose,\" and she went off in search. Nowhere was Tom to be seen. She called loudly, and searched in the bushes. \"He must have gone up to the house. \"Oh, here comes nurse. Nurse, have you seen Master Tom? He has just run away,\" she called. \"No, ma\u0027am, I have seen nothing of him.\" \"He must be about the garden then, somewhere. Look about, nurse. Where can the child have hidden itself?\" Nurse and mother ran about, calling loudly the name of the missing child. Five minutes later Mrs. Ripon ran into the study, where her husband was going through his farm accounts. \"Oh, Robert,\" she said, \"I can\u0027t find Tom!\" and she burst into tears. \"Not find Tom?\" her husband said, rising in surprise. \"Why, how long have you missed him?\" \"He was out in the garden with me. I was picking flowers for the dinner table and, when I looked round, he was gone. Nurse and I have been looking everywhere, and calling, but we cannot find him.\" \"Oh, he is all right,\" Captain Ripon said, cheerfully. \"Do not alarm yourself, little woman. He must have wandered into the shrubbery. We shall hear him howling, directly. But I will come and look for him.\" No better success attended Captain Ripon\u0027s search than that which his wife had met with. He looked anxious, now. The gardeners and servants were called, and soon every place in the garden was ransacked. \"He must have got through the gate, somehow, into the park,\" Captain Ripon said, hurrying in that direction. \"He certainly is not in the garden, or in any of the hothouses.\" Some of the men had already gone in that direction. Presently Captain Ripon met one, running back. \"I have been down to the gate, sir, and can see nothing of Master Tom; but in the middle of the drive, just by the clump of laurels by the gate, this boot was lying--just as if it had been put there on purpose, to be seen.\" \"Nonsense!\" Captain Ripon said. \"What can that have to do with it?\" Nevertheless he took the boot, and looked at it. It was a roughly-made, heavy boot, such as would be worn by a laboring man. He was about to throw it carelessly aside, and to proceed on his search, when he happened to turn it over. Then he started, as if struck. \"Good Heaven!\" he exclaimed, \"it is the gypsy\u0027s.\" Yes, he remembered it now. The man had pleaded not guilty, when brought up at the assizes, and the boot had been produced as evidence. He remembered it particularly because, after the man was sentenced, his wife had provoked a smile by asking that the boots might be given up to her; in exchange for a better pair for her husband to put on, when discharged from prison. Yes, it was clear. The gypsy woman had kept her word, and had taken her revenge. She had stolen the child, and had placed the boot where it would attract attention, in order that the parents might know the hand that struck them. Instantly Captain Ripon ran to the stable, ordered the groom to mount at once, and scour every road and lane; while he himself rode off to Hunston to give notice to the police, and offer a large reward for the child\u0027s recovery. He charged the man who had brought the boot to carry it away, and put it in a place of safety till it was required; and on no account to mention to a soul where he put it. Before riding off he ran in to his wife, who was half wild with grief, to tell her that he was going to search outside the park; and that she must keep up her spirits for, no doubt, Tom would turn up all right, in no time. He admitted to himself, however, as he galloped away, that he was not altogether sure that Tom would be so speedily recovered. The woman would never have dared to place the boot on the road, and so give a clue against herself, unless she felt very confident that she could get away, or conceal herself. \"She has probably some hiding place, close by the park,\" he said to himself, \"where she will lie hid till night, and will then make across country.\" He paused at the village, and set the whole population at work, by telling them that his child was missing--and had, he believed, been carried off by a gypsy woman--and that he would give fifty pounds to anyone who would find him. She could not be far off, as it was only about half an hour since the child had been missed. Then he galloped to Hunston, set the police at work and, going to a printer, told him instantly to set up and strike off placards, offering five hundred pounds reward for the recovery of the child. This was to be done in an hour or two, and then taken to the police station for distribution throughout the country round. Having now done all in his power, Captain Ripon rode back as rapidly as he had come, in hopes that the child might already have been found. No news had, however, been obtained of him, nor had anyone seen any strange woman in the neighborhood. On reaching the house, he found his wife prostrated with grief and, in answer to her questions, he thought it better to tell her about the discovery of the boot. \"We may be some little time, before we find the boy,\" he said; \"but we shall find him, sooner or later. I have got placards out already, offering five hundred pounds reward; and this evening I will send advertisements to all the papers in this and the neighboring counties. \"Do not fret, darling. The woman has done it out of spite, no doubt; but she will not risk putting her neck in a noose, by harming the child. It is a terrible grief, but it will only be for a time. We are sure to find him before long.\" Later in the evening, when Mrs. Ripon had somewhat recovered her composure, she said to her husband: \"How strange are God\u0027s ways, Robert. How wicked and wrong in us to grumble! I was foolish enough to fret over that mark on the darling\u0027s neck, and now the thought of it is my greatest comfort. If it should be God\u0027s will that months or years should pass over, before we find him, there is a sign by which we shall always know him. No other child can be palmed off upon us, as our own. When we find Tom we shall know him, however changed he may be!\" \"Yes, dear,\" her husband said, \"God is very good, and this trial may be sent us for the best. As you say, we can take comfort, now, from what we were disposed to think, at the time, a little cross. After that, dear, we may surely trust in God. That mark was placed there that we might know our boy again and, were it not decreed that we should again see him, that mark would have been useless.\" The thought, for a time, greatly cheered Mrs. Ripon but, gradually, the hope that she should ever see her boy again faded away; and Captain Ripon became much alarmed at the manifest change in her health. In spite of all Captain Ripon could do, no news was obtained of the gypsy, or Tom. For weeks he rode about the country, asking questions in every village; or hurried away to distant parts of England, where the police thought they had a clue. It was all in vain. Every gypsy encampment in the kingdom was searched, but without avail; and even the police, sharp eyed as they are, could not guess that the decent-looking Irishwoman, speaking--when she did speak, which was seldom, for she was a taciturn woman--with a strong brogue, working in a laundry in a small street in the Potteries, Notting Hill, was the gypsy they were looking for; or that the little boy, whose father she said was at sea, was the child for whose discovery a thousand pounds was continually advertised.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3170/86947.html","bookId":864,"book":{"id":864,"title":"For Name and Fame","description":"简介： In following the hero of this story through the last Afghan war, you will be improving your acquaintance with a country which is of supreme importance to the British Empire and, at the same time, be able to trace the operations by which Lord Roberts...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:37 AM"}}
