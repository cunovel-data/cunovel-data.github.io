{"id":44441,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 18: On The Helmund.","content":"With the junction of the forces of Generals Stewart and Roberts, what may be called the second period of the Afghan war came to an end. All opposition had ceased, and it appeared probable that there would be no more fighting. Abdul-Rahman, a prince of the royal house who--after for some time fighting against Sheer Ali--had been defeated, and obliged to fly the country; had, for a long time, been a resident among the Russians. Upon the abdication of Yakoub he had crossed the frontier, and had entered at the north of Afghanistan; assuming the title of Ameer. He had been well received in that part of the country, and as no other competitor for the throne appeared to have chances equal to his, and as the British government were most anxious to withdraw their forces from the country, his authority was recognized by us. Negotiations were opened with him; and it was arranged that, as he approached Cabul, the British force would retire. The summer had passed not unpleasantly, at Candahar. The country was peaceful. Cricket matches were got up between the various regiments, and horse races established. Candahar was governed by a protege of the British, named Wali Shere Ali. He had organized a native army, to support his authority upon our withdrawal. The only circumstances which occurred to mar the pleasing time were isolated attacks, upon British officers and men, by Ghazis. These attacks were sometimes made in broad daylight, in the streets of Candahar, where the escape of those who perpetrated them was impossible. These fanatics regarding their own life with indifference, so that they could but kill one or more of the British, before being cut down. One day, as William Gale was walking in the principal street of Candahar, at a short distance behind Colonel Ripon--an Indian official of very long standing and experience, who had come up on a special mission to arrange, with the Wali, the details of the civil government of the province--he saw three Afghans, who were loitering in the road, draw their long tulwars and dash upon that officer. The first who reached him delivered a sweeping blow; which the colonel, taken by surprise, partly received on his uplifted arm--but was struck to the ground. Another of the Ghazis raised his sword; but before it could fall Will Gale--who saw at once that he was too far behind to interpose between the assailant and the victim--drew his revolver from his belt and, taking a hasty aim, fired. The shot was an accurate one; the bullet striking the Afghan on the forehead, just as he was about to strike. He fell forward on the colonel; receiving, as he did so, a tremendous blow which the third Ghazi was aiming at the prostrate man. Illustration: Will saves Colonel Ripon. Before the blow could be repeated, Will had bounded forward and, sword in one hand and revolver in the other, faced the two Afghans. Another shot freed him of one of his assailants; just as the other, rushing recklessly forward, aimed a blow at him--which he was not quick enough to parry. His right arm fell to his side but, in an instant, he threw himself upon his foe; and the two fell heavily to the ground, the Afghan striving desperately to shorten his sword, so as to use the point; while Will strove to liberate his left arm--which was under the man--and so use his revolver, which he still grasped. At this moment some soldiers of the 66th ran up; and one of them, with his bayonet--which, since these attacks began, were always carried at the belt--brought the conflict to a conclusion, by running it through and through the Ghazi\u0027s body. Will soon rose to his feet. Colonel Ripon had already freed himself from the body of the dead Ghazi, and had struggled to his feet; the blood streaming from his head and arm. \"I have to thank you for my life, sir,\" he said, warmly. \"Had your aid come but two seconds less promptly, they would have finished me. \"But I fear you are severely wounded.\" \"Oh, no!\" Will answered. \"It is only a flesh wound, from my shoulder to my elbow. Luckily, my sword partly caught the blow. I was aiming at the other fellow, and had not time to parry fairly. I shall be none the worse for it, in a week\u0027s time. My wound is less severe than yours, sir.\" \"We are both bleeding pretty freely,\" the colonel said. \"My quarters are close at hand and, as the principal medical officer lives in the same house, you cannot do better than come in with me.\" In a few minutes their wounds were bandaged, the doctor saying that no serious harm had been done, in either case; but that care and quiet, lest fever should supervene, would be necessary for a week or two. As the house was much more airy, and commodious, than that in which Will was quartered, the colonel begged him so strongly to move his quarters thither, until able to return to duty, that Will agreed to do so; and was soon installed, with Yossouf in attendance, in the colonel\u0027s quarters. He was greatly pleased with the old officer, whose manner was most kind and courteous; and who, from his long experience in India, was full of anecdotes and information concerning the country. Ten days after the struggle, the doctor told them that there was no longer any occasion for his services. Their wounds were healing favorably, and all fear of fever had passed. At the same time, it would still be some time before either could take their arms from their slings. The following day, in honor of his convalescence, Colonel Ripon invited several friends to dinner; among them General Burrows, and Colonel Galbraith of the 66th. All had, of course, heard the details of the attack on Colonel Ripon; and Will was congratulated, warmly, upon the promptness that he had showed. \"Do you know, colonel,\" General Burrows said, as they were smoking their cigars after dinner, \"there is a wonderful likeness between you and Lieutenant Gale. I should have taken you for father and son, anywhere.\" The other officers agreed with the remark. The likeness was certainly strong. Both were men of six feet in height. The colonel\u0027s hair and mustache were grizzled, and his face bronzed with the sun of many Indian summers. He was thin and spare of habit; but his shoulders were broad, and it was evident that, in his youth, he must have possessed much of the muscular strength which was apparent in Will\u0027s more rounded limbs. But it was in their eyes that there was the greatest similarity. Both were gray, and of nearly the same shade; both had a simple, straightforward, and kindly expression; both were shaded by straight, and rather heavy eyebrows. The men looked at each other. \"I suppose he is like me,\" Colonel Ripon said; \"still more like, I fancy, what I remember myself, at his age; but curiously enough he has--ever since I met him--been recalling some one else to my mind;\" and a shade passed over his face. Seeing that Colonel Ripon was not disposed to talk further on the subject, a fresh topic of conversation was started. There was news that Ayoub Khan--the brother of Yakoob, who was governor at Herat--was marching south, at the head of a large force, with the intention of opposing Abdul-Rahman, and again reseating Yakoob on the throne. He had also preached a holy war against the British. \"I fear that the trouble is serious,\" General Burrows said. \"The troops Ayoub is bringing with him have not yet met us in the field. The population on the road is wild and fanatical, in the extreme; and will, no doubt, join him to a man. On the other hand, the troops of the Wali are not to be depended upon, and the brunt of the fighting is sure to fall upon us.\" Three days later, the order was issued by General Primrose that the 66th Regiment, the Bombay Grenadiers, and Jacob\u0027s Rifles; together with the 3rd Scinde Horse and 3rd Bombay Cavalry, with a battery of artillery; were to move out with the Wali\u0027s army towards Girishk, on the river Helmund, which formed the boundary between the province of Candahar and that of Herat. After the long period of inactivity at Candahar, Will was delighted at the thought of taking part in an expedition, with his regiment; but when they reached the Helmund life was, for some time, exceedingly monotonous. The news of Ayoub\u0027s advance greatly excited the population--who had been further worked up by agents, widely distributed through the country; and by the exhortations of the Mollahs and Ghazis. Consequently, rambling at any distance from the camp was forbidden; and the shooting parties, which had been one of the great resources of their life at Candahar, were peremptorily put an end to. Colonel Ripon had accompanied the force, as the Wali\u0027s adviser. Both he and Will had recovered completely from their wounds. When the regiment first marched, indeed, the surgeon had strongly recommended Will to remain behind, until his wound had completely healed; but the young officer had so strongly begged to be allowed to accompany the regiment that the surgeon had consented. His colonel had, for a time, relieved him from all duty, and he rode in rear of the regiment; but within a fortnight of their arrival at the Helmund, he was able to lay aside his sling, and to take his turn of regular duty. The officers did all that they could to make existence tolerable, on the sandy shores of the Helmund. They got up foot races and athletic sports for the men, played cricket on the sands, and indulged in a bath--twice a day--in the river. Will often spent the evening in Colonel Ripon\u0027s tent. A warm friendship had arisen between the two officers, and each day seemed to bring them closer together. All this time, Ayoub\u0027s army was known to be approaching. It had been delayed by want of transport, and by the difficult nature of the country over which it had to pass. The guns, too--of which it was reported to have a large number--had greatly hampered it but, by the second week in July, it was near at hand. For some time, the Wali\u0027s troops had been showing signs of insubordination; and little doubt was entertained that they had been tampered with, by Ayoub\u0027s emissaries. The question of disarming them was several times discussed; but the Wali maintained his faith that they would remain true to their salt, and the British force was so small that it was deemed imprudent to take any step to diminish their strength, by dispensing with the services of a strong body of men who might, after all, be faithful at the critical moment. Moreover, it was doubtful whether they would submit to be disarmed, by a force so inferior to their own. Should the attempt to disarm them succeed, they must either be escorted back to Candahar, by a strong detachment of the British; or be permitted to disperse, in which case they would assuredly swell the advancing army of Ayoub. One day Will arranged to start, the next morning at daybreak, for a day\u0027s shooting with four other young officers--Hammond and Fortescue of Jacob\u0027s Rifles, and Plater and Lowther of the Grenadiers. The country round the camp had been already shot over, so they were to go some miles out. Will\u0027s colonel--in giving him leave off parade for the day--had asked him to endeavor to ascertain, at any village he might enter, the state of the feeling of the natives respecting Ayoub, and their disposition towards the British; points on which a deplorable ignorance existed, in the camp. The party started before daybreak, putting their wiry little tats--or native ponies--into a gallop, so as to reach the spot--eight miles distant--where they were to begin to shoot as early as possible; so as to get two or three hours\u0027 sport, before the heat of the day really set in. After an hour\u0027s ride, they overtook their servants; who had gone on ahead, with the guns and luncheon. The sun was but just above the horizon, and the morning air was cool and pleasant. Dismounting, they handed over the ponies to the servants and, taking the guns and ammunition, set out on foot. The servants were to go on, with the ponies and lunch, to a village in the hills, four miles distant; and to get tiffin ready, by eleven o\u0027clock. The young officers set out on foot, keeping a short distance apart. Two of their servants accompanied them, to carry the game; the other three went with the two Syces, who looked after the ponies The ground was broken and stony, and altogether uncultivated, except in the neighborhood of the villages. They had better sport than they expected, for hares darted out in numbers from behind the rocks. Some of these were bowled over, while others escaped; and there was much bantering and laughter among the young men, none of whom were first-class shots. As the sun rose higher the game became more scarce and, by ten o\u0027clock, the party turned their faces towards the village where they were to lunch; and which lay, they calculated, a mile or two away on their right. The sun was now blazing down upon them; and they were glad, indeed, when they came in sight of the village--which was not perceived until they were close to it, as it lay in a deep and rocky valley. Yossouf met them, as they entered the village. \"Well, Yossouf, where have you laid the tiffin?\" \"I have spread it, sahib, on a level piece of ground, in the shade of the chief\u0027s house. He did not seem disposed to be civil and, indeed, I thought that it would be more pleasant out of doors, in the shade, than inside.\" \"Much more pleasant, Yossouf; and these forts, as they call them, are generally stuffy places, with small windows. What is the feeling of the people here?\" \"They are looking forward to Ayoub\u0027s coming, sir, when they say a holy war will be preached, and every man will rise against the infidels. When they found I was a countryman, they talked freely enough before me; especially as I led them to believe that I had been taken prisoner, at Cabul, and forced to accompany you as a sort of slave. \"I should recommend that, as soon as tiffin is over, you should start for the camp; for I don\u0027t think it is quite safe, here.\" \"They would never think of attacking us, Yossouf, with our force within an easy day\u0027s march.\" \"I don\u0027t know, sir,\" Yossouf said, doubtfully. \"They say that the Wali\u0027s men are all with them; and that these, alone, are quite sufficient to eat up the three British regiments.\" \"They will find out their mistake, if they try it. However, Yossouf, I will let the others know what you think.\" By this time, they had arrived at the spot where the lunch was laid out; and very tempting it looked, to hungry men. A great dish of curry--made with some fowls purchased in the village--was the principal dish; but there were some fish--which Yossouf had caught in the Helmund, on the previous day--a roast of young kid, and several dishes of fresh fruit. A large vessel of porous clay, containing the drinking water, stood close by; and the necks of some bottles of claret peeped, out from a tub full of water; while a pitcher of cold tea was ready, for those who preferred it. The young men set to with a vigorous appetite and, when the meal was over, pipes and cigars were lighted; and they prepared to enjoy a rest, until the heat of the day was past. Will now told them what Yossouf had said. \"Oh, nonsense, Gale!\" Hammond said. \"Your boy is an Afghan, and these fellows are always dreaming about treachery. \"They are scowling, sulky-looking brutes,\" he said, looking at a group of natives, who stood watching them, with lowering eyes, \"and of course, they hate us as infidel dogs but, as to attacking us, it\u0027s all nonsense.\" \"Well, you know, Hammond, these Ghazis do attack us, in all sorts of places--as I have found, to my cost--and these villages abound with these fanatics.\" \"Oh, yes,\" Fortescue said, lazily, \"of course they do; but we have got our revolvers handy, and our guns are within reach of our hands. We should make precious short work of any Ghazis who were to run amuck among us. \"Well, I for one don\u0027t mean to move, till it gets a bit cooler. If these fellows want to attack us, they have got the chance, now; and there is no more reason they should do it, three hours hence, than when we are having our breakfast, quietly.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3170/86964.html","bookId":864,"book":{"id":864,"title":"For Name and Fame","description":"简介： In following the hero of this story through the last Afghan war, you will be improving your acquaintance with a country which is of supreme importance to the British Empire and, at the same time, be able to trace the operations by which Lord Roberts...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:37 AM"}}
