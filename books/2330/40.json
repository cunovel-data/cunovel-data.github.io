{"id":64088,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"\"If you ever do-\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll call you immediately, rest assured.\" She frowned at the sketch. \"Definitely yellow. His name, I mean. John, in yellow script, over the left breast pocket.\" The superintendent at the Kashin Building didn\u0027t recognize the sketch, and it turned out he hadn\u0027t been working there at the time of Fred Karp\u0027s death. I went to the management company\u0027s office on West Thirty-seventh Street. Nobody there recognized the sketch, either, but a young woman checked personnel records and came up with an employee named John Siebert. He had started work five months before Karp\u0027s death and quit three weeks after. Under \"Reason for Leaving,\" she told me, it said \"Moving to Florida.\" \"I guess he decided to retire,\" she said. Hal Gabriel had been reclusive toward the end of his life, rarely leaving his apartment, ordering in from the Chinese restaurant and the liquor store. There were half a dozen Chinese restaurants within a few blocks of his building at Ninety-second and West End. I didn\u0027t know which ones had been in business twelve years ago when Gabriel was found hanged, but I hadn\u0027t yet known of a Chinese restaurant that employed Caucasian delivery boys. I checked the two liquor stores a block east on Broadway. Both had had recent changes of ownership. One had changed hands when the owner retired and moved to Miami. The owner of the other had been killed five years before in a robbery. No one in either store recognized James Shorter from the sketch. I had TJ along and we worked opposite sides of the street, showing the sketch in coffee shops and pizza parlors. The counterman at Poseidon looked at it and said, \"Haven\u0027t seen him in years and years. Two scrambled dry, toasted English no butter.\" He grinned at the expression on my face. \"Good memory, huh?\" Almost too good. I complimented him on it and went outside, and TJ reported the dry cleaner across the street had also made Shorter from the sketch, and recalled that his name was Smith. \"Right, Smith,\" I said. \"And he didn\u0027t want any butter on his English muffin.\" \"Huh?\" \"Smith? And he happened to remember the guy from twelve years ago?\" \"Was a woman,\" TJ said. \"An\u0027 she remembers him because he never came back for his suit jacket. Lady kept it for him for years, finally gave it to the Goodwill sometime last year. Soon as I showed her the picture, she got scared she\u0027s gonna get in trouble. \u0027I kep\u0027 it a long time,\u0027 she said.\" No one in Hal Gabriel\u0027s building recognized the sketch, nor did the list of 1981 tenants suggest anything. But there was an SRO hotel around the corner, and an old desk register showed that a Joseph Smith had occupied a room on the fourth floor for several months prior to Gabriel\u0027s death. A week after the body was discovered, Mr. Smith moved out and left no forwarding address. Rumpelstiltskin. I thought of him often, the evil dwarf from the fairy tale. I didn\u0027t know what Shorter had meant by the clue, or if it was in fact a clue at all. I followed a lot of very cold trails, looking for further traces of his presence near the scene of other deaths. It didn\u0027t matter. Nothing led anywhere. I have been detecting one way or another for so long that certain parts of the process have become virtually automatic for me. Now and then in recent years I have looked around for some other way to make a living, and invariably I have realized that this is what I do, that I am reasonably good at it, and that my experience and talent equip me for nothing else. And yet I don\u0027t begin to understand it. Sometimes it\u0027s reasonably straightforward. You go up one side of the street and down the other, you knock on every door, figuratively and literally, and each new piece of data clicks into place and points you toward a new street, with new doors to knock on. Finally you\u0027ve walked down enough streets and knocked on enough doors, and the final door opens and there\u0027s your answer. It\u0027s not easy and it\u0027s rarely simple, but there is a logic to the way it unfolds. But it\u0027s not always like that. Sometimes it\u0027s like a jigsaw puzzle. You separate all the straight-edged pieces and get the outside hooked together, and then you sort by color, and you try this and try that until you\u0027ve made a little progress. And you\u0027re looking for a certain piece, and it\u0027s not there. It\u0027s got to be missing, and you want to write the manufacturer and complain, and then you pick up a piece you\u0027ve already tried in that particular spot three or four times already, and you know it\u0027s not the one you\u0027re looking for, but this time it fits. It\u0027s not always like that, either. Jim Shorter, aka Joseph Smith, aka John Siebert. Aka Rumpelstiltskin? \"Maybe he stole some monogrammed luggage,\" Elaine suggested, \"and he can\u0027t bear to part with it.\" \"The places he lives,\" I said, \"you\u0027d be conspicuous if you moved in with shopping bags from a good store. He does like to hold on to those initials, though. What does JS stand for?\" \"Joan Scherman.\" \"Who\u0027s Joan Scherman?\" \"A photo stylist. She showed up at the shop yesterday and wanted to rent that little Biedermeier chair as a prop for a magazine ad. I had it tagged three-fifty and I would have taken three hundred for it, and she\u0027s paying a hundred dollars to rent it for two days. Isn\u0027t that great?\" \"It is if you get the chair back.\" \"Oh, she gave me a damage deposit and everything. It\u0027s a nice way to make money, don\u0027t you think? But that\u0027s not helping you.\" \"No.\" \"JS, JS, JS. Just Shopping. Jonas Salk. Jesus Saves. Jelly Sandwich. I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m no help at all.\" \"That\u0027s okay.\" She struck a pose. \"I\u0027ve got it,\" she said. \"Jewish Sexpot. What do you think?\" \"I think it\u0027s bedtime,\" I said. And so I went to bed and forgot all about James Shorter and his several aliases, and the next morning, shaving, it came to me. I put on a suit and tie, drank a cup of coffee, and took a cab to Penn Station. Sixteen hours later I emerged from Penn Station. It was past midnight. There was a man I wanted to talk to, but it was too late to call him. It would have to wait until morning. It was cool for a change, and although I\u0027d been on my feet a lot earlier in the day, I\u0027d spent the past several hours sitting on the train. I felt like stretching my legs, and I wound up stretching them all the way to the corner of Tenth Avenue and Fiftieth Street. \"I thought of you today,\" I told Mick Ballou. \"I was in Washington, and I went to have a look at the Vietnam Memorial.\" \"Did you now.\" \"I saw your brother\u0027s name.\" \"Ah,\" he said. \"Then no one\u0027s gone and rubbed it out.\" \"No.\" \"I hadn\u0027t thought they would,\" he said, \"but you never know what someone might do.\" \"You don\u0027t.\" \"It\u0027s quite a sight, isn\u0027t it? The Memorial. The shape of it, and all of those names. Name after name after name.\" \"It\u0027s a long line of dead men,\" I said. \"You were right about that.\" \"You couldn\u0027t have gone just to look at Dennis\u0027s name. You scarcely knew him.\" \"That\u0027s true.\" \"You knew Eddie Dunphy, and Eddie knew Dennis, but beyond that-\" \"I knew him by sight, but no, I didn\u0027t really know him.\" \"So you must have had other business in Washington, and just thought you\u0027d have a look at the Memorial while you were there.\" \"No,\" I said. \"As a matter of fact I went there just to look at the Memorial.\" \"Did you then.\" \"I used the directory,\" I said, \"and I managed to find Dennis\u0027s name, and the names of a few other men I\u0027d known who died over there. The brother of a girl I knew in high school. Fellows who\u0027d gotten killed over there twenty or twenty-five years ago, and I thought of them for the first time in years and looked for their names and there they were.\" \"Ah.\" \"And then I found myself doing what you mentioned having done, just walking along and reading names more or less at random. It was very moving. I\u0027m glad I went, if just for that.\" \"But you didn\u0027t go just for that.\" \"No,\" I said, \"I didn\u0027t. There was another name that I went to look for.\" \"And was it there?\" \"No, it wasn\u0027t.\" \"So you went all the way there for nothing?\" \"No,\" I said. \"I found what I was looking for.\" 29 I met Ray Gruliow in a bar called Dirty Mary\u0027s a block from City Hall. They do a brisk lunch business there, the crowd running to lawyers and bureaucrats, the specialty of the house a shepherd\u0027s pie topped with cheddar and browned under the broiler, but we were an hour too early for lunch and the place was empty except for a couple of old lags at the bar who might have been left over from the night before. Hard-Way Ray looked as though he, too, could have been left over from the night before. His face was drawn and he had dark circles under his eyes. He was in a booth with a cup of coffee when I got there, and I told the waiter I\u0027d have the same. \"No he won\u0027t,\" Gruliow said. \"He\u0027ll have an ordinary cup of coffee. Black, right?\" \"Black,\" I agreed. \"And I\u0027ll have another the hard way,\" he said. That, he explained when the waiter had withdrawn, was with a shot in it. I told him I\u0027d figured that out. \"Well, you\u0027re a fast study,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t usually start the day this way, but I had a hell of a night last night. Anyway, I\u0027ve been up for hours. I had to be across the way there when the gavel came down at nine o\u0027clock. I got a postponement, but I had to show up and ask for it.\" He sipped his fortified coffee. \"I like drinking out of coffee cups,\" he said. \"Gives you an idea what Prohibition must have been like. And I like a shot of booze in a cup of coffee. It keeps the caffeine from making you too edgy.\" \"Tell me about it.\" \"You used to drink it that way?\" \"Oh, once in a while,\" I said. I took out a copy of the sketch and handed it to him. He unfolded it, got a look at it, shook his head, and started to refold it. I put out a hand to interrupt the process. \"God,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve looked at this guy\u0027s ugly face until I can see it in my dreams. And I find myself expecting to see him everywhere, do you know what I mean? In the cab coming down here this morning I kept sneaking peeks at the driver, trying to see if it could be him. I took a second look at the waiter before.\" \"Just take a look at the sketch for now,\" I suggested. \"What am I going to see that I haven\u0027t already seen?\" \"You used to know this man,\" I said. \"I already told you he looks familiar, but-\" \"You haven\u0027t seen him in thirty years. He was in his middle twenties when you knew him.\" He ran the numbers, frowned. \"He\u0027s forty-eight now, isn\u0027t he? Thirty years ago he would have been-\" \"He lied about his age, either to be consistent with his fake ID or because he didn\u0027t want to be considered too old for the security-guard job. He must have taken eight or nine years off his real age. It\u0027s not the biggest lie he ever told.\" \"God, I know him,\" he said. \"I can picture his face, I can see him talking, I can almost hear the voice. Help me out, will you?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-40.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
