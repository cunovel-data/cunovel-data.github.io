Just so it looks like him.\" I went to a copy shop, ran two dozen copies of the sketch. It seemed to me it was a good likeness. I gave the original to Elaine but told her not to hang it anywhere for the time being. I left a copy with TJ, who raised an eyebrow and announced that Shorter was an ugly-looking dude. Over the next few days, I got around to most of the men who\u0027d been at the meeting at Gruliow\u0027s house, as well as a few who hadn\u0027t been able to make it. No one echoed TJ\u0027s sentiment, but neither did anyone recognize Shorter as a long-lost cousin. \"He\u0027s a pretty ordinary-looking guy,\" Bob Berk told me. \"Not a face that would jump out at you in a crowd.\" Several of them said he looked vaguely familiar. Lewis Hildebrand told me he might have seen Shorter before, that it was impossible to say. \"The visual onslaught in this city is overpowering,\" he said. \"Walk a few blocks through midtown Manhattan and more people will pass through your field of vision than the average small-town resident will see all year. Walk through Grand Central Station at rush hour and you\u0027ll see thousands of people without really seeing any of them. How much of it do we screen out? How much registers, consciously or otherwise?\" In his living room on Commerce Street, Hard-Way Ray Gruliow squinted at the sketch and shook his head. \"He looks familiar,\" he said. \"But in a very vague way.\" \"That\u0027s what I keep hearing.\" \"What a crazy thing, huh? Here\u0027s somebody who hates us all enough to devote his entire life to killing us. Because he\u0027s not a guy who got pissed off one morning and took a gun to the Post Office. This is his life\u0027s work.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"And we look at him,\" he said, \"and all we can say is he looks vaguely familiar. Who could he be? How could he know us?\" \"Where could you remember him from?\" \"I don\u0027t know. The only time we were all together was once a year at dinner. Maybe he was a waiter at Cunningham\u0027s. What did we decide he was, sixteen years old? He couldn\u0027t have been a waiter. Maybe he was a busboy.\" \"And maybe you stiffed him on the tip.\" \"No, we wouldn\u0027t do a thing like that. We\u0027re a generous bunch.\" Local 100 of the Restaurant and Hotel Workers of America maintains offices on Eighth Avenue, just two blocks from Restaurant Row. I talked to a man there named Gus Brann who was amused at the thought of trying to hunt down employees of a restaurant that had gone out of business twenty years ago. \"Restaurant work isn\u0027t the trade it once was,\" he said. \"Not on the service floor. You used to have waiters who spent their life in the profession. They knew their customers and they knew how to serve. Now do you know what you get? Actors and actresses. \u0027My name is Scott and together we\u0027ll enjoy a dining experience.\u0027 Guess what percentage of the rank and file also holds membership in Actors Equity.\" \"I have no idea.\" \"Plenty,\" he said. \"Take my word for it. You go out for a meal and what you get is an audition.\" \"The turnover\u0027s not as high in the old-fashioned steak houses, is it?\" \"No, you\u0027re right about that, but how many of them have we got left? You got Gallagher\u0027s, you got the Old Homestead, you got Keens, you got Peter Luger, you got Smith and Whatsisface, Wollensky, you got-\" I said, \"Waiters tend to stay with the same general type of restaurant, don\u0027t they?\" \"I just told you, they don\u0027t even stay with the business.\" \"But the old-fashioned type of waiter. If a man was working at Cunningham\u0027s and it went out of business, he\u0027d probably look for work at one of the places you just mentioned, don\u0027t you think?\" \"Unless he had a longing to scoop Rocky Road at a Baskin-Robbins. But yeah, you tend to stay with what you know.\" \"So if you wanted to find somebody who used to work at Cunningham\u0027s, those would be the first places to look.\" \"I suppose.\" \"But I myself would hardly know how to begin,\" I said. \"And I\u0027d have to spend a couple of days running all over the city, trying to convince people to give me the time of day. Whereas a knowledgeable person like yourself could probably manage the whole thing by just making a few phone calls.\" \"Hey,\" he said. \"I got a job to do, you know what I mean?\" \"I know.\" \"I can\u0027t sit around making phone calls, bugging people, asking who worked where twenty, thirty years back.\" \"You\u0027d be saving me time,\" I said, \"and time is money. I wasn\u0027t looking to get the information for free.\" \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, that puts a different light on it, doesn\u0027t it?\" The following day I called Gruliow and told him I\u0027d found not one but two gentlemen who\u0027d spent their lives bringing steak dinners to people with hearty appetites. \"They were both working at Cunningham\u0027s when it closed,\" I said. \"One of them started there as a busboy over forty years ago.\" \"He\u0027d have been there for our first dinner,\" he said. \"Christ, he\u0027d have been around for quite a few meetings of the previous chapter.\" \"He didn\u0027t recognize the sketch, though. Neither did the other fellow, who\u0027s actually quite a bit older, although he was only at Cunningham\u0027s from 1967 on. He went from there to the Old Homestead, and that\u0027s where he was when he retired three years ago last September. They both said the same thing.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"They said he looked familiar.\" \"Oh, Jesus,\" Gruliow said, \"You know what our friend\u0027s got? He\u0027s got a universally familiar face. Nobody can place it, but everybody thinks he must have seen it somewhere before. You know, Matt, that was just an offhand remark of mine about his having worked at Cunningham\u0027s.\" \"I know.\" \"Yet you followed it up.\" \"It was worth checking.\" \"How on earth did you find those fellows?\" \"I didn\u0027t,\" I said. \"I found someone who could find them for me. You know, if I were to hand this over to the cops, they\u0027d be able to turn up a dozen men who worked at Cunningham\u0027s during the period in question. And one of them might be able to put a name to the face in the sketch.\" \"I was talking to some of the others,\" he said. \"And?\" \"We all intend to be very cautious. We\u0027ll keep an eye out for the man in the sketch. But we\u0027d rather not go public with this if we don\u0027t have to.\" \"If someone else is killed-\" \"You said he\u0027d probably lay low for the next six months.\" \"That\u0027s what I said,\" I agreed, \"but what the hell do I know? I can\u0027t presume to predict what a madman is going to do next. And so far he hasn\u0027t shown any inclination to call me up and let me know.\" That was on a Wednesday afternoon. That night I went to a meeting for the first time all week, and I stopped at the Flame afterward and had a cup of coffee. One of the fellows at the table was a newcomer, and the others were trying to help him, answering his questions and reassuring him that there really was life after sobriety. The new man was in his early thirties and looked nothing like Jim Shorter, but his attitude was very similar to the persona Shorter had adopted for the occasion, mixing guarded hope and cynical skepticism. It made me very uncomfortable to sit at the same table with him. He wasn\u0027t doing anything wrong, and I knew he wasn\u0027t putting on an act, but I couldn\u0027t help feeling as though I was being conned all over again. I went home and told Elaine about it. She said, \"You\u0027d like to kill him, wouldn\u0027t you?\" \"The guy tonight? Oh, you mean Shorter.\" \"Of course.\" \"I guess I\u0027m angry,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t really feel it, but it must be there. I was trying to help him, the cocksucker, and he was just playing me like a fish on a line. The son of a bitch.\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"I think you might be the slightest bit angry.\" She started to say something else but the phone rang and she got up and answered it. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Just one moment, I\u0027ll see if he\u0027s in.\" She covered the mouthpiece. \"It\u0027s him,\" she said. 27 \"Jim,\" I said. \"I\u0027m glad you called. I was hoping I\u0027d hear from you.\" \"Well, I\u0027ve been busy, Matt.\" \"Hey, I know what it\u0027s like,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve been running around a lot myself. I tried to reach you a couple of times but I guess you were out.\" \"I guess I was.\" \"I thought I might run into you at a meeting, but I\u0027m on the other side of town.\" \"Whole different world.\" \"That\u0027s right. How\u0027s it going?\" There was a pause. Then he said, \"I know you know, Matt.\" \"Oh?\" \"Funny thing is I thought you knew from the jump. I thought, shit, they finally figured out what\u0027s going on and hired themselves a detective. But you didn\u0027t know a thing, did you?\" \"No.\" \"Getting me to come to an AA meeting. I thought it was a ruse at first. Get me off my guard, take me by surprise. But you weren\u0027t suspicious at all, were you? You figured I needed help and you wanted to help me.\" \"Something like that.\" \"You know,\" he said, \"that was very decent of you, Matt. Seriously.\" \"If you say so.\" \"And the meetings were interesting. I can see how a person with a drinking problem would find a whole new life in the rooms. And I get the feeling some people who aren\u0027t alcoholics go for the companionship and the sense that they\u0027re getting their lives in order.\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll find many like that,\" I said. \"No? Well, you\u0027d be a better judge of that than I am, Matt. See, I, uh, gave you a false impression. I\u0027m not an alcoholic.\" \"Whatever you say.\" He laughed. \"Denial, right? I bet you get to hear it all the time. No, see, I just wanted a neat exit from Queensboro-Corona, and Marty Banszak\u0027s a bear when it comes to booze. Son of a bitch eats Valium all day long, he\u0027s tranked out like the night of the living dead, but if he smells alcohol on your breath you\u0027re history.\" \"But he gave you a second chance.\" \"Yeah, isn\u0027t that a gas? Second time around I figured let\u0027s leave nothing to chance.\" \"What did you do, call in the complaint yourself?\" \"How\u0027d you know? Hey, you\u0027re a detective, right? It\u0027s your job to figure things out.\" \"It is,\" I said, \"and I don\u0027t seem to be doing too well at it.\" \"Hey, I think you\u0027re doing fine, Matt.\" \"There are things I can\u0027t figure, Jim.\" \"Like what?\" \"Like why you\u0027re doing it.\" \"Ha. Can\u0027t work that out, can you?\" \"I thought maybe you\u0027d help me.\" \"You mean like give you a hint?\" \"Something like that.\" \"Nah, I can\u0027t do that. Hey, I\u0027ll tell you, it hardly matters how I got started on this project. Man starts collecting stamps, pasting \u0027em in a book, lives in an attic on peanut-butter sandwiches, puts every dime he can into his stamp collection, are you gonna ask him what got him started collecting in the first place? He\u0027s a stamp collector.
