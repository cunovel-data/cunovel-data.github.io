It\u0027s a logic problem.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m a Jewish girl,\" she said. \"Cannibals, Christians, what\u0027s the difference? Who can tell them apart?\"\\n\\n \"Not you, evidently.\"\\n\\n \"Not me,\" she agreed. \"You know what I say? Goyim is goyim. That\u0027s what I say.\"\\n\\n We had dinner at an Italian place on the next block. It still hadn\u0027t rained, and looked and felt more like it than ever. \"So you met Gerry Billings,\" Elaine said. \"I hope you asked him if he could do anything about this weather.\"\\n\\n \"God, he must get sick of hearing that.\"\\n\\n \"If he doesn\u0027t get sick of pointing at the wall and talking about warm fronts and cold fronts, he probably doesn\u0027t ever get sick of anything. When you see him pointing at a map or a chart, he\u0027s not really, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Somebody else is pointing for him?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s pointing at nothing,\" she said, \"and the image of him pointing is superimposed on another image of a map or chart. So it comes out looking right, but he\u0027s got to stand there and point at a blank wall. That\u0027s probably the hardest part of his whole job, remembering what part of the wall is Wyoming.\"\\n\\n We fought over the check. She wanted to pay it because she\u0027d sold one of the paint-by-number paintings for approximately a hundred times what she\u0027d paid for it. I pointed out that that was still only a couple of hundred dollars, while I\u0027d just scooped up a nine-thousand-dollar retainer.\\n\\n \"You still have to buckle down and earn it,\" she said. \"The painting, on the other hand, is out of my hands and out of the store. The transaction is completed. Done, finis, finito.\"\\n\\n \"Too bad,\" I said. \"This one\u0027s on me.\"\\n\\n Back home, I checked the answering machine. Jim Shorter hadn\u0027t called, and I\u0027d expected that he would. I tried him and he didn\u0027t answer. Then I tried my own number across the street, to see if I\u0027d forgotten to engage Call Forwarding, but I got a busy signal, which indicated that I\u0027d remembered.\\n\\n I tried Alan Watson\u0027s widow in Forest Hills. No answer.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re restless,\" Elaine said. \"Do you feel like a movie? Or do you think you ought to go to a meeting?\"\\n\\n I said, \"I was thinking of taking a cab up to Yorkville.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s there?\"\\n\\n \"A meeting.\"\\n\\n \"St. Paul\u0027s is handier. Why go all the way up there? You want to check up on your new sponsee, is that it?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not my sponsee.\"\\n\\n \"Your unofficial sponsee. He didn\u0027t call and you\u0027re worried about him.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose so. What would your friends in Al-Anon say about that?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027d tell me it\u0027s none of my business how you work your program.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not what I meant.\"\\n\\n \"I know. You meant what would they tell you to do, and if you want to know that you\u0027ll have to ask them yourself.\"\\n\\n \"I should leave him alone,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Think so, huh?\"\\n\\n \"I should go to meetings for myself, not for anybody else, and if he gets sober that\u0027s fine, and if he goes out and drinks again that\u0027s fine, too.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll drink,\" I said, \"and I\u0027m afraid it\u0027ll be my fault. But it won\u0027t be my fault if he drinks, and it won\u0027t be my doing if he stays sober, and anyway he\u0027s got his own Higher Power. Right?\"\\n\\n \"Everything you say is right, master.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, boy.\"\\n\\n \"So what are you going to do? Grab a cab uptown?\"\\n\\n \"Nah, fuck him,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s go to a movie.\"\\n\\n The movie we saw starred Don Johnson as a homicidal gigolo and Rebecca De Mornay as his attorney. As we left the theater, Elaine said, \"I cannot believe how much she looked like Hillary.\" Who was Hillary, I wanted to know, and who looked like her?\\n\\n \"Hillary Clinton,\" she said. \"Who else? And De Mornay looked enough like her to fool the president himself. You didn\u0027t notice? I can\u0027t believe it. Where were you, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"Lost in space, I guess. Regretting the past, dreading the future.\"\\n\\n \"Business as usual. Just to keep you abreast of things, Don Johnson was the bad guy.\"\\n\\n \"I got that much,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Well, how much more do you really need to know? I think it\u0027s finally going to rain. I just felt a drop, unless it dripped from somebody\u0027s air conditioner.\"\\n\\n \"No, I felt it, too.\"\\n\\n \"Dueling air conditioners? Unlikely, I\u0027d say. What do you want to do now?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Go home, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Sit around and stare out the window? Make a few phone calls to people who aren\u0027t home? Pace the floor?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a better idea,\" she said. \"Walk me home and then go see if Mick wants to make a night of it. Get blitzed on coffee and Perrier. Watch the sun come up. Go to mass, take Holy Reunion.\"\\n\\n \"Communion.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever.\"\\n\\n \"Goyim is goyim, huh?\"\\n\\n \"You said it.\"\\n\\n In front of the Parc Vend—Ñme she said, \"It\u0027s definitely raining. You want to come upstairs and get an umbrella?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not raining that hard.\"\\n\\n \"Want to see if anybody called? Want to catch the weather report and see what color bow tie your friend Gerry Billings is wearing? Naw, you don\u0027t need a weatherman to tell which way the rain is falling.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not. You just want to get to Grogan\u0027s. Give Mick my love, will you? And enjoy yourself.\"\\n\\n 22\\n\\n \"You just missed him,\" Burke said. \"He stepped out not fifteen minutes ago. But he\u0027ll be along. He said you might be in.\"\\n\\n \"He did?\"\\n\\n \"And that you should wait for him as he\u0027ll not be long. There\u0027s fresh coffee made, if you\u0027ll have a cup.\"\\n\\n He poured coffee for me and I carried it to the table where Mick and I usually wound up sitting, over on the side beneath the mirror advertising Tullamore Dew. Someone had left a copy of the Post on a nearby table, and I opened it to the sports section to see what the columnists had to say. I wasn\u0027t much better at tracking their sentences than I\u0027d been at following the movie. After a while I set the paper aside and thought about trying Jim Shorter again. Was it too late to call him? I was considering the point when the door opened and Mick Ballou entered.\\n\\n He stood just inside the door, his hair pressed flat against his skull by the rain, his clothes sodden. When he caught sight of me his face lit up. \"By God,\" he said, \"didn\u0027t I say you\u0027d be in tonight? But what a fucking night you picked for it.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t much more than a fine mist when I came here.\"\\n\\n \"I know, for was I not out in it myself? A soft day, the Irish call it. A fucking downpour is what it\u0027s turned into.\" He rubbed his hands together, stamped his feet on the old tile floor. \"Let me get out of these wet clothes. Catch a cold this time of the year and the fucker\u0027s with you till Christmas.\"\\n\\n He went into his office in the back. He sleeps there sometimes on the green leather couch, and keeps several changes of clothing in the oak wardrobe. He has a desk there, too, and a massive old Mosler safe. There\u0027s always a lot of cash in the safe, and I can\u0027t believe the box would be all that hard to crack. So far no one has ever been fool enough to try.\\n\\n He emerged from the office after a few minutes with his hair neatly combed and wearing a fresh sport shirt and slacks. He said a few words to one of the darts players, laid a gentle hand on the shoulder of an old man in a cloth cap, and slipped behind the bar to pour himself a drink. He threw down a quick shot to take the chill off, and I could almost feel the warm glow radiating outward from the solar plexus, providing comfort, warming the body and the soul. Then he refilled his glass and brought it to the table along with a fresh cup of coffee for me.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s better,\" he said, dropping into the seat opposite mine. \"Terrible thing, being called out on business on a night like this.\"\\n\\n \"I hope it went well.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, \u0027twas nothing serious,\" he said. \"There was this lad who lost a few dollars gambling, and gave a marker for what he owed. Then he decided he\u0027d been cheated, and so he made up his mind that he wasn\u0027t going to pay the debt.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And your man who\u0027d taken his marker offered it for sale.\"\\n\\n \"And you bought it.\"\\n\\n \"I did,\" he said. \"I thought it a decent investment. Like buying a mortgage, and deeply discounted in the bargain.\"\\n\\n \"You paid cash for it?\"\\n\\n \"I did, and sent Andy Buckley to talk to the lad. And do you know, he still insisted he\u0027d been cheated, and thus owed nothing, no matter who might be holding his marker. He said there was no point in discussing it, that his mind was made up.\"\\n\\n \"So what did you do?\"\\n\\n \"I went to see him.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"He changed his mind,\" Mick said.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s going to pay?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s paid. So you might say it was an excellent investment, offering an attractive return. And it\u0027s matured early.\"\\n\\n He is a large man, my friend Mick, tall and heavy, with a head that would not look out of place among the ancient sculptures on Easter Island. There is a primitive and monolithic quality to him. Years ago, a wit at Morrissey\u0027s after-hours described Stonehenge as looking like Mick and his brothers standing in a circle.\\n\\n It may be fitting, then, that he is just about the last of a vanishing breed, the tough Irish criminals who have been drinking and fighting and raising hell in the West Forties and Fifties since before the Civil War. Various gangs and mobs held sway- the Gophers, the Rhodes Gang, the Parlor Mob, the Gorillas. A lot of their leaders were saloon keepers, too, from Mallet Murphy and Paddy the Priest to Owney Madden. They were as cheerfully vicious as any group New York ever saw, and they might have made a more lasting mark on the place if they hadn\u0027t had such an all-consuming thirst. According to Mick, God created whiskey to keep the Irish from taking over the world. It had certainly kept the Hell\u0027s Kitchen hoodlums from taking over the city.\\n\\n A few years ago some newspaper reporters started calling the current crop \"the Westies,\" and by the time the tag caught on there was hardly anybody left to pin it to. The neighborhood bad guys were mostly gone- dead of drink or violence, doing life sentences somewhere upstate, rotting away in the back wards at Manhattan State Hospital. Or they were married and living somewhere in the Jersey suburbs, getting fat and sluggish, running crooked auto-repair shops, rigging the games in church Las Vegas Night fundraisers, or working all week for their fathers-in-law and drinking themselves sodden on the weekends.\\n\\n Mick, the son of a woman from County Mayo and a father born in France, not far from Marseilles, was a man who drank whiskey like water, a career criminal, a brutal killer who would costume himself for a night of slaughter in the butcher\u0027s apron his father had worn, then wear the same apron to mass at St. Bernard\u0027s. There was no reason why we should have become friends, and no way to explain our friendship. Nor could I find an explanation for these long nights of ours, when the stories flowed like water or like whiskey. He would drink for both of us, filling his glass time and time again with the twelve-year-old Jameson. I would keep him company with coffee, with Coca-Cola, with soda water. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-31.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) \\n In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
