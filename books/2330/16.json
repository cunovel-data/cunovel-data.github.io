I\u0027d get you a black tanktop if I thought you\u0027d wear it, but would you?\" \"No.\" \"That\u0027s what I thought. Let me put these in water, and then I\u0027ll close up and you can walk me home. Unless the flowers were for the apartment?\" \"No, I thought they\u0027d look nice here.\" \"You\u0027re right, and I\u0027ve even got an empty vase the right size. There, don\u0027t they look pretty? We\u0027ll stop at the Korean and pick up something for a salad, and I\u0027ll fix us some pasta and a salad and we\u0027ll eat at the kitchen table. How does that sound?\" I said it sounded fine. After dinner I opened the envelope I\u0027d been carrying around all day and got out the printouts of the TRW reports, along with the letter of commendation Wally had dictated to the client. Elaine went into the other room to watch Jeopardy and I had a look at what just about anybody with a couple of bucks to spend could find out about the financial standing and bill-paying habits of the fourteen living members of the club of thirty-one. I had gone through most of the stack when Elaine brought me a cup of coffee and the news that none of the three contestants had known that Benjamin Harrison was the grandson of William Henry Harrison. \"Neither did I,\" I admitted. \"What was the category, Guys Named Harrison?\" \"Presidents.\" \"Oh, William Henry Harrison. Tippecanoe?\" She nodded. \"And Tyler, too. It all comes back to me. He died, didn\u0027t he?\" \"No shit, Sherlock. He was elected president in 1840, so what do you want from him? What\u0027s this?\" She took the client\u0027s letter from me and read it through. \"This is great,\" she said. \"Wally dictated it?\" \"So he says.\" \"It\u0027s perfect, don\u0027t you think? You should make it a point to get one of these whenever you\u0027ve got a client who tells you what a great job you did for him.\" \"I suppose.\" \"Your enthusiasm is contagious.\" \"I guess I should have it framed and hang it on my office wall,\" I said, \"if I ever get a real office. And I could tuck a copy in the portfolio I show to prospective clients.\" \"If you ever put together a portfolio.\" \"Right.\" \"But you don\u0027t know if you want all that.\" The coffee was too hot to drink. I blew on the surface to cool it. I said, \"It\u0027s about time I got off my ass, don\u0027t you think? It\u0027s been twenty years since I turned in my gold shield.\" \"You were bottoming out with your drinking,\" she said. \"Remember?\" \"Vividly.\" \"And then you were getting sober.\" \"And now I\u0027ve been dry so long I\u0027m a fire hazard, as I\u0027ve heard it said, and what the hell have I done with my life?\" I tapped the sheaf of credit reports. \"Here\u0027s a group of guys my age,\" I said, \"and they\u0027ve got families and careers, they own their own homes, and most of them could retire tomorrow if they wanted to. What have I got to put up against that?\" \"Well, for one thing,\" she said, \"you\u0027re alive. More than half of those men are dead.\" \"I\u0027m talking about the living ones. Anyway, nobody\u0027s been trying to kill me.\" \"Oh? I can think of one fellow who really put his mind to it for a while there. If you forget what he looks like, look in the mirror.\" \"I get the point.\" \"And,\" she said, \"give yourself a little credit, will you? From the day you left the department you\u0027ve made a living.\" \"Some living.\" \"Were you ever on welfare? Did you ever miss a meal or sleep in the park? Did you break into parked cars and steal radios? I don\u0027t remember seeing you on the street with a paper cup, asking for spare change. Did I miss something?\" \"I got by,\" I said. \"You made a living,\" she said, \"doing the work you\u0027re best at, and you didn\u0027t chase after it, either. You let it come to you.\" \"The Zen detective,\" I said. \"And now you\u0027re fifty-five years old,\" she said, \"and you think you ought to be more of a man of substance. You got along for twenty years without a PI license, but now you think you need one. Your clients somehow found their way to you when you worked out of your hotel room, but now you think you need an office. Look, if you want those things, that\u0027s terrific. You can rent office space in a good building and get stationery and promotional brochures printed and go after the law firms and the corporate clients. If that\u0027s what you want, I\u0027ll back you up all the way. I\u0027ll run the office for you, if you\u0027d like that.\" \"You\u0027ve got a shop to take care of.\" \"I can hire an assistant. Every day I get people asking if I can use help, and some of them are better qualified to run the place than I am. Or I could close the place.\" \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous.\" \"What\u0027s ridiculous? It\u0027s a hobby, something to keep me from going crazy.\" \"When I walked over there this afternoon,\" I said, \"I stood in front of the window and I was in awe of what you\u0027ve done.\" \"Come on.\" \"I mean it. You\u0027ve made something out of nothing. You took an empty storefront and all the artworks you\u0027ve collected over the years, and you\u0027ve added things nobody else saw the beauty in until you pointed it out to them.\" \"My thriftshop masterpieces.\" \"And Ray\u0027s stuff, for God\u0027s sake. He was nothing but a cop with a useful skill until you made him realize he was an artist.\" \"That\u0027s exactly what he is.\" \"And you put it all together,\" I said. \"You\u0027ve made it work. I don\u0027t know how the hell you did it.\" \"Well, I\u0027ve been having fun with it,\" she admitted. \"But I don\u0027t know if it\u0027ll ever make a profit. Fortunately it doesn\u0027t have to.\" \"Because you\u0027re a rich lady.\" She owns rental properties in Queens, all of it managed for her by a company that does that sort of thing. Every month she gets a check. She said, \"That\u0027s part of it, isn\u0027t it?\" \"What\u0027s part of what?\" \"I have some money saved,\" she said. \"And you don\u0027t.\" \"Both of those statements are true.\" \"And we\u0027re living in an apartment I paid for.\" \"Also true.\" \"Which means you ought to have a more substantial career so we can be on an even footing.\" \"You figure that\u0027s it?\u0027 \"I don\u0027t know. Is it?\" I thought about it. \"It\u0027s probably a factor,\" I said. \"But what it does is make me take a good look at myself, and I see a guy who hasn\u0027t accomplished a hell of a lot.\" \"You\u0027ve got some former clients who would disagree with that, you know. They might not be able to give you an endorsement on a fancy company letterhead, but they amount to a lot more than helping some manufacturer of schlock patio furniture avoid a lawsuit. Look at the difference you\u0027ve made in people\u0027s lives.\" \"But I haven\u0027t done much for my own self, have I.\" I brandished the stack of credit reports. \"I was reading these,\" I said, \"and imagining what the wonderful people at TRW would have to say about me.\" \"You pay your bills.\" \"Yes, but-\" \"Do you want the license and the office and all the rest of it? It\u0027s up to you, honey. It really is.\" \"Well, it\u0027s ridiculous not to have the license,\" I said. \"There have been times when it\u0027s cost me work not to have it.\" \"And the respectable office, and a string of operatives and security personnel under you?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"I don\u0027t think you want it,\" she said. \"I think you feel you ought to want it, but you don\u0027t, and that\u0027s what upsets you. But it\u0027s your call.\" I went back to the stack of credit reports. It was slow going, because I didn\u0027t know what I was looking for. My hope was that I would recognize it when I saw it. Douglas Pomeroy. Robert Ripley. William Ludgate. Lowell Hunter. Avery Davis. Brian O\u0027Hara. John Gerard Billings. Robert Berk. Kendall McGarry. John Youngdahl. Richard Bazerian. Gordon Walser. Raymond Gruliow. Lewis Hildebrand. I knew what a few of them looked like. I\u0027d seen Gerry Billings on television, talking about cold fronts and the threat of rain. In my library research I\u0027d come upon news photos of Gordon Walser (with two partners, celebrating the opening of their own ad agency) and Rick Bazerian (with two punked-out rock stars who\u0027d just signed with his record label). And of course I\u0027d been seeing Avery Davis\u0027s picture in the paper for years. I\u0027d been in the same room with Ray Gruliow a couple of times over the years, although we\u0027d never been introduced. And I knew Lewis Hildebrand, my client. But it seemed to me as though I could picture all of them readily enough, including the ones whose faces were wholly unfamiliar to me. As I read their names and reviewed their credit histories, images kept popping into my mind. I saw them walking behind power mowers over suburban lawns, I saw them dressed in suits, I watched them bend over to scoop up small children and hold them aloft. I pictured them on the golf course, then saw them having a drink in the clubhouse after they\u0027d showered and changed, drinking whiskey and soda, say, in a tall frosted glass. I could see them, in their well-tailored suits, leaving their houses at dawn, coming home at dusk. I could see them standing on platforms with their newspapers, waiting for the Long Island Rail Road or Metro North. I could see them striding purposefully along a midtown sidewalk, carrying brassbound attache–± cases, on their way to meetings. I could picture them at the opera or the ballet, their wives finely dressed and bejeweled, themselves at once resplendent and slightly self-conscious in evening clothes. I could imagine them on cruise ships, in national parks, at backyard barbecues. It was silly, because I didn\u0027t even know what they looked like. But I could see them. \"I\u0027ll give it another day or two,\" I told Elaine, \"and then I\u0027m going to call Lewis Hildebrand and tell him it\u0027s just a statistical anomaly. His group\u0027s running a high death rate and an unusual number of homicides, but that doesn\u0027t mean somebody\u0027s knocking them off one by one.\" \"You got all that from a batch of credit reports?\" \"What I got,\" I said, \"is a picture of fourteen very orderly lives. I\u0027m not saying these men don\u0027t have a dark side. The odds are a couple of them drink too much, or gamble for high stakes, or do something they wouldn\u0027t want their neighbors to know about. Maybe this one slaps his wife around, maybe that one can\u0027t keep it in his pants. But there\u0027s a degree of stability in every one of their lives that just doesn\u0027t fit a serial murderer.\" \"If he\u0027s been doing it for this long,\" she said, \"he\u0027s unusually disciplined.\" \"And patient, and well organized. No question about it. But there\u0027d be chaos in his life. He\u0027d be holding things together, but not without a lot of backing and filling, a lot of fresh starts and makeovers. I\u0027d expect to see a lot of job changes, a lot of geographics. It\u0027s almost inconceivable that he\u0027d have stayed married to the same person for a substantial period of time, for example.\" \"And have they all managed that?\" \"No, there have been quite a few divorces. But the ones who\u0027ve divorced show a consistent pattern of career stability. There\u0027s nobody in the whole group who looks at all like the kind of loose cannon he\u0027d almost have to be, in order to do the damage he\u0027s done.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-16.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life. But when these men start to die at alarming rates, murder rears its ugly head. It\u0027s clear someone is determined to kill them all.
