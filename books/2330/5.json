{"id":64053,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"That\u0027s part of it. That\u0027s what got me looking for an explanation.\" \"And?\" \"I sat down and made a list of our deceased members and the various ways they died. Some of them very obviously had not been murdered, their deaths could only have been the result of natural causes. Phil Kalish, for example, killed in a head-on on the LIE. The other driver was drunk, he\u0027d managed to get on the wrong side of the divider and was speeding eastbound in the westbound lane. If he\u0027d lived he might have been prosecuted for vehicular homicide, but it doesn\u0027t sound like something some devious mass murderer could have arranged.\" \"No.\" \"And some Viet Cong or North Vietnamese soldier killed Jim Severance. Death in combat isn\u0027t something you usually think of as a natural cause, but I wouldn\u0027t call it murder, either.\" His fingers just touched the bowl of the snifter, then withdrew. \"There were some natural deaths that couldn\u0027t have been anything else. Roger Bookspan developed testicular cancer that had metastasized by the time they caught it. They tried a bone-marrow transplant but he didn\u0027t survive the procedure.\" His face darkened at the memory. \"He was only thirty-seven, the poor son of a bitch. Married, two kids under five, a first novel written and accepted for publication, and all of a sudden he was gone.\" \"That must have been a while ago.\" \"Close to twenty years. One of our early deaths. More recently, there were a couple of heart attacks. I mentioned Frank DiGiulio, and then two years ago Victor Falch dropped dead on the golf course. He was sixty years old, forty pounds overweight, and diabetic, so I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d call that suspicious circumstances.\" \"No.\" \"On the other hand, several of our members have been murdered, and there have been other deaths that could conceivably have been murder, although the authorities didn\u0027t classify them as such. I mentioned Alan Watson, stabbed in a mugging.\" \"And the fellow in Chelsea who was killed by a sexual partner,\" I said, and scanned my memory for the name. \"Carl Uhl?\" \"That\u0027s right. And then of course there was Boyd Shipton.\" \"Boyd Shipton the painter?\" \"Yes.\" \"He was a member of your club?\" He nodded. \"At our initial meeting he said that the most interesting fact he could tell us about himself was that he\u0027d painted a wall of his apartment to look like exposed brick. He was a trainee on Wall Street at the time, and he made it sound as though painting was just a pastime for him. Later, after he\u0027d quit his job and made his first gallery connection, he admitted he\u0027d been afraid to let on just how important it was to him.\" \"He became very successful.\" \"Extremely successful, with an oceanfront house in East Hampton and a state-of-the-art loft in Tribeca. You know, I\u0027ve often wondered what became of that faux-brick wall Boyd painted. He slapped a couple of coats of flat white wall paint on it before he moved, so that the landlord wouldn\u0027t have a fit. Well, whoever\u0027s living there now has an original Boyd Shipton trompe-l\u0027oeil mural under God knows how many layers of Dutch Boy latex. I suppose it could be restored, if anyone knew where to look for it.\" \"I remember when he was killed,\" I said. \"Five years ago, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"Six in October. He and his wife had come into the city for a friend\u0027s opening and went out to dinner afterward. When they returned to their loft downtown they evidently walked in on a burglary in progress.\" \"The wife was raped, as I recall.\" \"Raped and strangled, and Boyd was beaten to death. And the case was never solved.\" \"So you\u0027ve had three murders.\" \"Four. In 1989 Tom Cloonan was shot to death at the wheel of his cab. He was a writer, he published quite a few short stories over the years and had a play or two produced Off-Off-Broadway, but he couldn\u0027t make a living at it. He\u0027d make up the difference working for a moving company or renovating apartments for an unlicensed contractor. And sometimes he drove a cab, and that\u0027s what he was doing when he died.\" \"And they never cleared that case, either?\" \"I believe the cops made an arrest. I don\u0027t think the case ever went to trial.\" It wouldn\u0027t be hard to find out. I said, \"Thirty men, and four of them have been the victims of homicides. I think that\u0027s more remarkable than the fact that sixteen of you have died.\" \"I was thinking that myself, Matt. You know, when I was a kid growing up, I don\u0027t think my parents were acquainted with a single person who\u0027d been murdered. And I didn\u0027t grow up in some storybook town in South Dakota, either. I grew up in Queens, first in Richmond Hill and then we moved to Woodhaven.\" He frowned. \"I\u0027m wrong, because we did know someone who was murdered, although I couldn\u0027t tell you his name. He owned a liquor store on Jamaica Avenue and he was shot and killed during a holdup. I remember how upset my parents were.\" \"There were probably others,\" I suggested. \"You\u0027re less aware of that sort of thing when you\u0027re a kid, and parents tend to shield you from it. Oh, there\u0027s no question that the homicide rate\u0027s higher than when we were kids, but people have been killing each other since Cain and Abel. You know, in the middle of the last century there was a sprawling tenement complex in Five Points called the Old Brewery, and when they finally tore it down the workmen hauled sack after sack of human bones out of the basement. According to informed estimates, that one building averaged a murder a night for years.\" \"In one building?\" \"Well, it was a pretty good-sized building,\" I said. \"And it couldn\u0027t have been a very nice neighborhood.\" 4 In addition to the homicides, Lew told me, there were cases of suicide and accidental death, some of which might have been murder in disguise. He had a pair of lists, which he took from his inside breast pocket and unfolded for me. One bore in alphabetical order the names of the club\u0027s fourteen surviving members, along with their addresses and phone numbers. The other was a list of the deceased- all seventeen of them, including Homer Champney. They were listed in the order they\u0027d died, with the presumptive cause of death noted for each man. I read through both lists, drank some coffee, and looked across the table at him. I said, \"I\u0027m not sure what sort of role you have in mind for me. If you just wanted a consultation, I\u0027ll say this much. Your club\u0027s been hit with an awfully high death rate, and it certainly seems to me that a disproportionate number have resulted from causes other than illness. Any of the suicides could have been faked, along with most of the accidents. Even some of the deaths that look natural might be disguised homicide. This one fellow who choked to death on his own vomit, well, there\u0027s a way to make that happen.\" \"How, for God\u0027s sake?\" \"The victim has to be unconscious. You jam a pillow or towel over his face and hold it there while you induce vomiting. There\u0027s an emetic you can give by subcutaneous injection, but something might show up in an autopsy if anyone had the wit to look for it. A knee in the pit of the stomach is almost as effective. The victim vomits and there\u0027s no place for it to go, so he automatically aspirates it into the lungs. It\u0027s an easy way to knock off a drunk, you just wait until he\u0027s passed out and sleeping it off. And drunks are apt to die choking on their vomit, so it\u0027s a very plausible kind of accidental death.\" \"It sounds absolutely diabolical.\" \"I guess. Back in the mid-sixties there was a United States senator who died like that, and there were strong rumors that he\u0027d been assassinated, either by the Cubans or the CIA, depending on who was telling the story. But this was in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, when every public death brought rumors of murder and conspiracy. If a politically prominent person died of Alzheimer\u0027s, you\u0027d hear that the Illuminati had been putting aluminum salts in his cornflakes.\" \"I remember.\" He drew a deep breath. \"I figured there might have been some elaborate way Eddie Szabo\u0027s death might have been brought about. But I had no idea it could have been managed that simply.\" \"And it also could have been just what it looks like.\" \"An accident.\" \"Yes.\" \"But on balance you think I have reason to be concerned.\" \"I think it calls for investigation.\" \"Would you be willing to undertake that investigation?\" I was expecting the question and I had my answer ready. \"If this is what it\u0027s beginning to look like,\" I said, \"you\u0027re dealing with a serial murderer with a remarkable degree of patience and organization. This isn\u0027t some drifter on a cross-country spree, snatching truck-stop hookers at random and strewing their corpses along I-80. He\u0027s picking specific targets and taking his time knocking them off. He\u0027s probably killed eight people, and maybe more. \"All of which calls for a full-scale investigation, and I\u0027m just one guy. If this were an NYPD investigation, they\u0027d have a whole roomful of detectives working on it.\" \"Do you think I should take this to the police?\" \"In an ideal universe, yes. In the real world, I think they\u0027d just shine you on. The way the bureaucracy works, no cop would be all that eager to open this can of worms. You\u0027re looking at a whole crazy quilt of conflicting jurisdictions, and some possible homicides dating back twenty years. If I were a cop and this landed on my desk, I\u0027d have every reason to drop it in a file folder and lose track of it.\" I took a sip of coffee. \"If you really wanted to get the police moving on this, the best way would be through the media.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"Just tell some eager reporter the same thing you told me. It\u0027s got plenty of news value all by itself, and a whole lot more when you toss a couple of prominent names in the hopper. Boyd Shipton, for one. And your survivors list shows a Raymond Gruliow on Commerce Street. I assume that\u0027s the lawyer.\" \"The defense attorney, yes.\" \" \u0027The controversial defense attorney\u0027 is how the press generally phrases it. If you went around telling cops Hard-Way Ray was on somebody\u0027s hit list, nine out of ten of them would try to find the guy just so they could buy him a drink and wish him good luck. But if you told a reporter, you\u0027d get a ton of coverage.\" He frowned. \"The idea of publicity,\" he said, \"is one I find very disturbing.\" \"So I\u0027d imagine.\" \"If what I suspect is true, if there\u0027s a murderer stalking us and thinning our ranks, then I would do whatever\u0027s required to stop him. I\u0027d go on Oprah, if it came to that.\" \"I don\u0027t think it will.\" \"But if I\u0027m just overreacting to a statistical coincidence, well, it would be a shame to destroy the club\u0027s anonymity unnecessarily. And the attention we\u0027d get as individuals would be most unwelcome, too.\" \"For most of you,\" I said. \"Ray Gruliow probably thinks \u0027unwelcome attention\u0027 is a contradiction in terms. Still, you\u0027ve got a tough call to make. The fastest way to get a full-scale investigation under way is to sit down with a reporter and tell him the same story you just told me. My guess is you\u0027d have national media coverage within twenty-four hours and a police task force assigned inside of forty-eight. With dead men in several states, plus the serial-killer element, you might even see the FBI come in on it if the publicity heats up enough.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-5.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
