But something always turns up.\" \"And always will.\" \"Let\u0027s hope so. Here\u0027s something else I decided. I don\u0027t want to put off the things I really want to do. You\u0027ve been to Europe what, three times?\" \"Four.\" \"Well, I\u0027ve never been, and I\u0027d like to get over there before I have to use a walker. I want to go to London and Paris.\" \"I think that\u0027s a great idea.\" \"They gave me a nice bonus,\" I said. \"So as soon as the check cleared I went to a travel agent and booked a trip. I figured I\u0027d better spend the money right away.\" \"Otherwise you might piss it away on necessities.\" \"That was my thinking. Our flight leaves JFK a week from Monday. We\u0027ll be gone for fifteen days. That gives us a week in each city. It\u0027ll mean closing the shop, but-\" \"Oh, screw the shop. It\u0027s my shop. I ought to be able to decide when to close up. God, this is exciting! I promise I won\u0027t pack too much. We\u0027ll travel light.\" \"Yeah, sure.\" \"You\u0027ve heard that song before, huh? I\u0027ll try to travel light. How\u0027s that?\" \"Pack all you want,\" I said. \"It\u0027s your honeymoon, so why shouldn\u0027t you have whatever you want with you?\" She looked at me. \"We keep saying we\u0027re going to get married,\" I said, \"and we keep not quite getting around to it. Trying to figure out where to have the wedding and who to invite and every other damn thing. Here\u0027s what I want to do, if it\u0027s okay with you. I want to go down to City Hall Monday morning and have the standard three-minute ceremony. Twenty-four hours later we\u0027ll be landing at Heathrow.\" \"You\u0027re full of surprises, aren\u0027t you?\" \"What do you say?\" She put her hand on mine. \"In the words of Gary Gilmore,\" she said, \" \u0027Let\u0027s do it.\u0027 \" In Paris, drinking the same kind of coffee at the same sort of cafй on the Rive Gauche, I found myself talking about James Severance. \"I keep seeing him sitting there,\" I said. \"Sitting on the edge of his bed with a chain on his leg, and over his shoulder I could see the noose dangling from a hook in the ceiling beam.\" \"Rumpelstiltskin,\" she said. \"The evil dwarf. What did that mean, anyway? Did he tell you?\" \"He probably would have, if I\u0027d thought to ask him. I forgot. But I think I know what he meant. In the story, the dwarf told the girl he\u0027d let her off the hook if she guessed his name. In other words, if you know my name then you have the power. If I looked at all the names he used over the years I\u0027d see the pattern of the initials, and then I\u0027d know who he was.\" \"But you got there backwards, didn\u0027t you? First you learned who he was, and then you figured out what the clue meant. Some clue.\" \"I don\u0027t think it was supposed to lead me anywhere.\" \"Why do you think he gave it to you?\" \"To feel powerful. The man in control, handing out clues like alms, and feeling superior to the beggars standing around with their hands out.\" \"I suppose,\" she said. \"What do you think he\u0027ll do?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Kill himself, I guess. How long can you stay there before you stick your neck in the noose and step off into the air?\" \"It seems so cruel,\" she said. \"I know, and if there\u0027d been a more humane alternative I would have argued for it. The noose was my idea, that and the cyanide capsule. If you\u0027re going to lock a man up for life, it seems to me he should have the option of shortening that life. I\u0027ve never been able to understand why they have suicide watches on death row. Why stop a condemned man from killing himself? Hasn\u0027t he got the right?\" \"I guess so.\" \"Gruliow\u0027s completely opposed to capital punishment. I can\u0027t say I agree with him. That doesn\u0027t mean I want to lead parades in favor of it.\" \"It\u0027s like my position on abortion,\" she said. \"Strictly middle-of-the-road. I don\u0027t believe it should be illegal, but I don\u0027t believe it should be compulsory, either.\" \"You\u0027re a moderate.\" \"You bet.\" She gave me what I believe they call a sidelong glance. I don\u0027t know what the French call it, but I\u0027m sure they\u0027ve got a word for it. \"All this talk about death,\" she said. \"You wouldn\u0027t want to go back to the hotel for an affirmation of life, would you?\" A while later she said, \"Wow. You really, uh, made me see les йtoiles. That means stars.\" \"No kidding.\" \"You old bear. God, what you did to me.\" \"Well, when in France-\" \"That\u0027s right, they invented that particular activity, didn\u0027t they? Or at least they get the credit. You want to hear something ridiculous?\" \"It wouldn\u0027t be the first time.\" \"I was afraid it might not be as good after we were married.\" \"And here we are, acting like a couple of newlyweds.\" \"Newlyweds, at our age. Who\u0027da thought?\" Her fingers moved to toy with the hair on my chest. She said, \"I like being married.\" \"So do I.\" \"But it\u0027s really just a piece of paper. It doesn\u0027t have to change anything.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean our life works. We don\u0027t have to fool with it just because we\u0027re wearing wedding rings. They\u0027re on our fingers, not in our noses. We can have just as much space in our lives as we had before. I think you should keep your hotel room across the street.\" \"Think so?\" \"Definitely. Even if all you do is go there when you feel like watching a ball game and staring out the window. That doesn\u0027t have to change.\" Her hand found mine, squeezed. \"Nothing has to change. We can still go to Marilyn\u0027s Chamber once in a while. I can still wear leather and look dangerous.\" \"And I can wear my guayabera and look ridiculous.\" \"Nothing has to change,\" she said. \"Do you hear what I\u0027m saying?\" \"I think so.\" \"Your private life is your business. Just don\u0027t stop loving me.\" \"I never have,\" I said. \"I never will.\" \"You\u0027re my bear and I love you,\" she said. \"And nothing has to change.\" Early in December I had lunch with Lewis Hildebrand at the Addison Club. Our conversation ranged far and wide in the course of the meal, and over coffee he said, \"I have something to propose to you, and I\u0027m not quite sure how to begin. As you know, our little club has a member who\u0027s no longer able to attend meetings. In point of fact, he resigned his membership years ago, but we were under the impression that he had died. Is he still a member? Shall we resume reading his name when he does in fact pass on?\" \"Those are interesting questions.\" \"And there\u0027s no need to answer them now. But in addition to having this member who\u0027s not a member, we also have for the first time in our history a nonmember who is intimately acquainted with the club. You\u0027ve met most of our members, you know our history. As a matter of fact, you\u0027ve been a part of our history. Some of us were discussing the rather special status you enjoy, and someone suggested that perhaps you ought to be a member.\" I didn\u0027t know what to say. \"We have never taken in a new member before,\" he said, \"and we\u0027ve never replaced members who have died, because that would be contrary to our whole design. But this would be a case of replacing a member who has not died, and it seems curiously appropriate. Obviously a step of this nature would require the unanimous endorsement of the entire membership.\" \"I would think so, yes.\" \"And it has received it. Matt, I\u0027ve been authorized to invite you to take up membership in the club of thirty-one.\" I took a breath. \"I\u0027m honored,\" I said. \"And?\" \"And I accept.\" This year the first Thursday in May fell on the fifth. I was there in the upstairs banquet room at Keens with the other thirteen surviving members. I listened as Raymond Gruliow, our chapter\u0027s senior member, read the names of the deceased members, starting with Philip Kalish and ending with Gerard Billings. He did not read James Severance\u0027s name, but the omission did not require a policy decision. Severance is still alive, still chained to the floor of the cabin on Red Hawk Island. Maybe he\u0027ll outlive us all. Three weeks and a day after our annual dinner, Ray Gruliow called me. \"You\u0027d know this,\" he said. \"Do they still have AA meetings at the little storefront on Perry Street?\" \"They do indeed,\" I said. \"Six or seven times a day.\" \"The times I went, the room was so smoky you couldn\u0027t see from one end of it to the other.\" \"It\u0027s smoke-free these days,\" I said. \"Well, that\u0027s something,\" he said. \"I was thinking I might see what the place looks like these days. How\u0027d you like to keep me company?\" I met him at his house and we walked over there together. He said, \"I feel a little funny about this. I\u0027m sort of a controversial character. And I haven\u0027t exactly kept a low profile over the years. I\u0027m in the media all the time.\" \"You\u0027ve even got a sandwich named after you.\" \"I told you about that, huh?\" \"Listen, if some deli owner made a sandwich and called it the Matt Scudder, I\u0027d tell the whole world. But what\u0027s your biggest fear, Ray? That people at Perry Street will recognize you? Or that they won\u0027t?\" He stopped in midstride, looked at me, and let out a bark of laugher. \"Jesus,\" he said, \"it really is all ego, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Pretty much.\" \"My wife left. That\u0027s three marriages down the toilet. Last week I was hung over during jury selection and made a really bad call. And my liver\u0027s swollen, and I woke up the day before yesterday and couldn\u0027t remember how I got home. And just before I called you I was thinking about Severance and it struck me that it wouldn\u0027t be that bad to stick my neck in a noose and kick the chair away. You know something? I don\u0027t give a shit who recognizes me and who doesn\u0027t. Something\u0027s got to change while I can still recognize myself.\" \"It sounds as though you\u0027re ready.\" \"Jesus,\" he said, \"I hope you\u0027re right.\" \"So do I,\" I said. \"The last time I took a guy to a meeting, it didn\u0027t work out too well.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-46.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life. But when these men start to die at alarming rates, murder rears its ugly head. It\u0027s clear someone is determined to kill them all.
