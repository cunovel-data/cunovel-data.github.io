I told you I went out and saw Fred Karp\u0027s widow. She was married to him for something like twenty-five years. She knew he had dinner with some old friends once a year, but she thought they were fraternity brothers of his from Brooklyn College. And she didn\u0027t know the names of any of them.\" \"She also told you she didn\u0027t think he could have killed himself.\" \"Well, the survivors always tell you that about suicides. If you go up in a tower and shoot twenty people, the neighbors tell the press you were a nice quiet boy. If you kill yourself, they say you had everything to live for.\" \"Then you think he did kill himself?\" \"I think it\u0027s beginning to look that way.\" \"I thought you said the suicides could have been faked.\" \"Most suicides could have been faked,\" I said. \"There are exceptions, like the poor son of a bitch who shot himself on live TV with the camera rolling.\" \"I\u0027m glad I missed that one.\" \"But even if most suicides could have been faked,\" I went on, \"that doesn\u0027t mean they are. Most of them are just what they look like. So are most accidents.\" \"You think the Warren Commission got it right?\" \"Jesus, where did that come from?\" \"Left field. I just wondered. Do you?\" \"I think they\u0027re a lot closer to the truth than Oliver Stone. Why? You think I\u0027m too quick to believe what I want to believe?\" \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" \"Well, it\u0027s a possibility, whether you said it or not. It seems to me I\u0027ve been working hard to prove that somebody really is knocking them off, and that I\u0027m coming reluctantly to the conclusion that the true villain of the piece is our old friend Coincidence. But maybe that\u0027s what I wanted to conclude all along. I don\u0027t know.\" \"It just seems to me,\" she said, \"that you\u0027re attaching an awful lot of significance to a good credit rating.\" \"It\u0027s not just that I\u0027d be inclined to okay these guys for MasterCard. The whole lifestyle that goes with it, the whole-\" \"I know. You look at the TRW reports and all you see is one big Norman Rockwell painting. They\u0027re the American Dream, aren\u0027t they?\" \"I suppose so.\" \"And you feel excluded because you can\u0027t have that life, and even more excluded because you don\u0027t even want it. That\u0027s a big part of it, Matt, isn\u0027t it?\" The telephone rang. \"Saved by the bell,\" she said, grinning, and reached to answer it. \"Hello? May I ask who\u0027s calling? Just a moment, I\u0027ll see if he can come to the phone.\" She covered the mouthpiece with her hand. \"Raymond Gruliow,\" she said. \"Oh?\" I took the phone from her and said hello. He said, \"Mr. Scudder, this is Ray Gruliow. I think we ought to get together, don\u0027t you?\" The voice was his, all right, rich and rasping, an instrument that he wielded like a rapier. I\u0027d heard it last on the television news, when he was lecturing a gang of reporters on the insidious effect of institutionalized racism on his client, Warren Madison. Madison, as I recalled, had been so victimized by racism that he dealt dope, robbed and murdered other dope dealers, and shot six of the cops who showed up at his mother\u0027s house to arrest him. \"Maybe we should,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve got a court appearance scheduled in the morning. How\u0027s the later part of the afternoon? Say, four o\u0027clock?\" \"Four is fine.\" \"Do you want to come over to my house? I\u0027m on Commerce Street, if you know where that is.\" \"I know Commerce Street.\" \"Oh, of course you would. You were at the Sixth Precinct, weren\u0027t you? My house is number forty-nine, right across the street from the Cherry Lane Theater.\" \"I\u0027ll find it,\" I said. \"Four o\u0027clock? I\u0027ll see you then.\" \"I look forward to it,\" he said. \"Four o\u0027clock tomorrow,\" I told Elaine, \"and he looks forward to it. I wonder what the hell he wants.\" \"Maybe it\u0027s unrelated to what you\u0027re working on. Maybe he wants to hire you as an investigator.\" \"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"He heard what a bang-up job I did nailing the Velcro Vaulter and he wants to sign me up for his team.\" \"Maybe he wants to confess.\" \"That\u0027s it,\" I said. \"Hard-Way Ray Gruliow, with his house on Commerce Street and his twenty-grand lecture fees. He\u0027s been killing his old friends for the past twenty years, and he wants my help in turning himself in.\" 12 Commerce Street is only two blocks long. It angles southwest from Seventh Avenue a block below Bleecker, and runs along parallel to Barrow Street. The first block is all of a piece, with both sides lined with brick three-story Federal townhouses. Most are residential, but a few have commercial tenants on the first floor. One window shows a lawyer\u0027s shingle, with a second matching shingle hanging just below the first. I ALSO DABBLE IN ANTIQUES, it announces, and there are antiques and collectibles in the window. The building two doors down houses a macrobiotic restaurant, its menu listing dishes of tofu and seitan and seaweed. Whatever else they dabble in remains unstated. The second block of Commerce Street, on the other side of Bedford, is more of a jumble architecturally. Buildings of different heights and shapes and styles are jammed together like straphangers in a rush-hour subway car. The street, as if confused by this sudden change of character, veers abruptly to the right and runs into Barrow Street, where it calls it quits. The Cherry Lane Theater is in the middle of the block, just before the street\u0027s sudden change of direction. Raymond Gruliow\u0027s townhouse, four stories tall and two windows wide, stood on the other side of the street, buttressed by a shorter and wider building on either side. I climbed a half-flight of steps. There was a heavy brass door knocker in the shape of a lion\u0027s head, and I had my hand on it when I saw the recessed button for the doorbell. I pushed that instead, and if a bell or buzzer rang within, no sound came through the heavy wooden door. I was ready to try the knocker when the door opened inward. Gruliow had answered it himself. He was a tall man, around six-three, and rail thin. His hair, once black, was an iron gray now, and he\u0027d let it grow; it cascaded over his collar and lay in ringlets on his shoulders. The years had worked on his features like a caricaturist\u0027s pen, lengthening the nose, accenting the bony ridge of brow, hollowing the cheeks, giving a forward thrust to the jaw. He looked searchingly at me, and then his face lit up with a smile, as if he were genuinely glad to see me, as if someone had played a cosmic joke on the world and the two of us were in on it. \"Matthew Scudder,\" he said. \"Welcome, welcome. I\u0027m Ray Gruliow.\" He led me inside, apologizing for the condition of the house. It looked all right to me, if marked by a comfortable level of disorder- books overflowing the built-in cabinets and piled on the floor, a stack of magazines alongside a club chair, a suit jacket folded over the back of a Victorian sofa. He was wearing the pants to the suit, and a white shirt with the collar open and the sleeves rolled up. He had sandals on his feet, Birkenstocks, and they looked odd over the thin black socks that went with the dark pinstriped suit. \"My wife\u0027s in Sag Harbor,\" he explained. \"I\u0027m going to join her out there tomorrow afternoon, come back in time for court Monday morning. Unless I call her and tell her I\u0027ve got too much work. And I might just do that. What the hell\u0027s the point of running out of town for a weekend, then running right back in again? Is that supposed to be relaxing?\" \"Some people do it all the time.\" \"Some people go to truck-pulling contests,\" he said. \"Some people sell Amway dealerships to their friends. Some people believe the earth is a hollow sphere, with another whole civilization living on the inside edge.\" He shrugged eloquently. \"Some people keep getting married. Are you married, Matt?\" \"Virtually.\" \" \u0027Virtually.\u0027 I like that. All right to call you Matt?\" I said it was. \"And I\u0027m Ray. \u0027Virtually.\u0027 I suppose that means living together? Well, you\u0027re an unlicensed private eye, why shouldn\u0027t you be an unlicensed spouse? I assume you were married previously.\" \"Once, yes.\" \"Children?\" \"Two sons.\" \"Grown now, I suppose.\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027ve been married three times,\" he said, \"and I\u0027ve had children with all three of them. I\u0027m sixty-four years old and I have a daughter who was two in March, and she\u0027s got a brother who\u0027ll turn forty next month. He\u0027s damn near old enough to be her grandfather. For Christ\u0027s sake, I\u0027ve got three generations of families.\" He shook his head at the wonder of it all. \"I\u0027ll be eighty years old,\" he said, \"and still paying to put a kid through college.\" \"They say it keeps you young.\" \"In self-defense,\" he said. \"I think it\u0027s late enough for a drink. What can I get you?\" \"Plain club soda, thanks.\" \"Perrier all right?\" I said it was. He fixed the drinks from a sideboard in the dining room, filling two glasses with Perrier, adding Irish whiskey to his. I recognized the shape of the bottle; it was JJ\u0026S, Jameson\u0027s premium label. The only other person I know who drinks it is a career criminal who owns a Hell\u0027s Kitchen saloon, and he\u0027d have blanched at the thought of diluting it with soda. In the front room Gruliow gave me my drink, cleared off a chair for me, and sat on the sofa with his long legs out in front of him. \"Matthew Scudder,\" he said. \"When I heard your name the other day, it wasn\u0027t entirely unfamiliar to me. Actually, I\u0027m surprised our paths haven\u0027t crossed over the years.\" \"As a matter of fact,\" I said, \"they have.\" \"Oh? Don\u0027t tell me I had you on the stand. I\u0027ve always said I never forget a hostile witness.\" \"I was never called to testify in any of your cases. But I\u0027ve seen you in the Criminal Courts Building and a couple of restaurants in the area, Ronzini\u0027s on Reade Street and a little French place on Park Row that\u0027s not there anymore. I don\u0027t remember the name.\" \"Neither do I, but I know the place you mean.\" \"And years ago,\" I said, \"you were at the next table at an after-hours way the hell west on Fifty-second Street.\" \"Oh, for God\u0027s sake,\" he said. \"One flight up over an Irish experimental theater, with burned-out buildings on either side and a rubble-strewn lot across the street.\" \"That\u0027s the one.\" \"Three brothers ran it,\" he remembered. \"What the hell were their names? I want to say Morrison, but that\u0027s not right.\" \"Morrissey.\" \"Morrissey! They were wild men, red beards halfway down their chests and cold blue eyes hinting at sudden death. According to rumor, they were tied in with the IRA.\" \"That was what everybody said.\" \"Morrissey\u0027s. I haven\u0027t so much as thought about the place in years. I don\u0027t think I went there more than two or three times all told. And I imagine I was always fairly well lit by the time I got there.\" \"Well, there was a time when I was there a lot,\" I said, \"and everybody was fairly well lit by the time he got there. People behaved themselves, the brothers saw to that, but you\u0027d never have looked around and thought you were at a Methodist lawn party.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-17.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
