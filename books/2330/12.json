Although she had originally made the first overtures, giving me to understand that she was available to me, since then she had initiated nothing. She never called my home or office. I always called, asking if she felt like company, and she always told me to come over.\\n\\n We were never together outside her apartment. We never walked down the street side by side, or had a cup of coffee together. One night Elaine and I stopped at Armstrong\u0027s after a concert at Lincoln Center, and Elaine spotted Lisa in the crowd at the bar. It was Elaine who had introduced me to Lisa and her husband; the two women had met at a class at Hunter College. \"Isn\u0027t that Lisa Holtzmann?\" she\u0027d said, nodding toward the bar. I looked and agreed that it was, but neither of us suggested going over and saying hello.\\n\\n In her apartment, in her bed, I could shut out the world. It was as if those rooms on the twenty-eighth floor existed somehow outside of space and time. I would shuck off my life like a pair of boots and leave it at the door.\\n\\n I suppose it wasn\u0027t much of a stretch to say she was like a drug or a drink to me. I\u0027d thought fleetingly of calling the liquor store, reached for the phone, and called her instead. The connection wasn\u0027t usually that clearly wrought. I would find myself thinking of her, and wanting to be with her. Sometimes I resisted the impulse. Sometimes I didn\u0027t.\\n\\n I rarely went to her more than once a month, and during the winter there\u0027d been a stretch of almost three months when I\u0027d never even reached for the phone. Shortly after the first of the year I thought of her and thought, Well, that\u0027s over, feeling a curious mixture of sadness and relief. Early in February I called and went over there, and we were right back where we\u0027d started.\\n\\n Afterward we watched the sunset. It must have been around nine. The sunsets were coming later every day now, with less than a week to go until Midsummer Eve.\\n\\n She said, \"I\u0027ve been working a lot. I got a great assignment, six covers from a paperback western series.\"\\n\\n \"Good for you.\"\\n\\n \"The hardest part is reading the books. They\u0027re what they call adult westerns. Do you know what those are?\"\\n\\n \"I could probably guess.\"\\n\\n \"You probably could. The hero doesn\u0027t say, \u0027Shucks, ma\u0027am.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"What does he say?\"\\n\\n \"In the one I just finished he said, \u0027Why don\u0027t you get shed of that petticoat so I can eat that sweet little pussy of yours.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"How the West was won.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s shocking,\" she said, \"because you think you\u0027re reading Hopalong Cassidy, and the next thing you know somebody\u0027s getting fisted behind the corral. The hero\u0027s name is Cole Hardwick. That\u0027s pretty straightforward, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n \"One gets the point.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m doing a different western scene for each cover. The two constants are guns and cleavage. Oh, and Cole Hardwick\u0027s weathered face in the foreground, so you\u0027ll know right away it\u0027s another book in the series.\" She extended a hand, ran her forefinger along my jaw. \"I almost used this face,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"I started sketching, and what came out began to look curiously familiar. It was a great temptation to leave it. I wonder if you\u0027d ever have seen one of the books, and if you\u0027d have recognized yourself.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Anyway, I decided you\u0027re not right for it. You\u0027re too urban, too streetwise.\"\\n\\n \"Too old.\"\\n\\n \"No, Hardwick\u0027s pretty grizzled himself. Look, there goes the sun. Will I ever get tired of sunsets? I hope not.\"\\n\\n The show was even richer once the sun was down. A whole rainbow of colors stained the Jersey skyline.\\n\\n She said, \"I\u0027ve been seeing somebody.\"\\n\\n \"Somebody nice, I hope.\"\\n\\n \"He seems nice. He\u0027s an art director for an in-flight magazine. I showed him my book and he didn\u0027t have any work for me, but he called me the next day and took me to dinner. He\u0027s nice-looking and fun to be with and he likes me.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve had four dates. Tomorrow we\u0027re going to have an early dinner and see Eleven Months of Winter at Playwrights Horizon. And then I suppose I\u0027ll sleep with him.\"\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t yet?\"\\n\\n \"No. A couple of, you know, lingering kisses.\" She clasped her hands in her lap and looked down at them. \"When you called, my first thought was to tell you not to come over today. And then I said I didn\u0027t want to do anything, and how long did that last? Half a minute?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder what it is with us.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve wondered myself.\"\\n\\n \"What happens if I start sleeping with Peter? What will I say when you call?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Come on over,\u0027 I\u0027ll say. And afterward I\u0027ll feel like a whore.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t see myself sleeping with two men at once. I don\u0027t mean literally at the same time, I mean-\"\\n\\n \"I know what you mean.\"\\n\\n \"Having a relationship with Peter, and still going to bed with you. I can\u0027t see myself doing that. But I can\u0027t imagine saying no to you, either.\"\\n\\n \"Daddy stuff?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I suppose so. When you kissed me there was a split second when I could taste liquor on your breath. Of course that was just memory. He never came to my room without liquor on his breath. Did I tell you he was in treatment?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Well, Minnesota. Land of ten thousand lakes and twenty thousand alcoholism-treatment centers. The doctor was concerned that his liver was enlarged and sent him for treatment. My mother says he\u0027s not drinking anything now but a little beer with meals. I don\u0027t suppose that will last.\"\\n\\n \"It never does.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe his liver\u0027ll blow up and he\u0027ll die. Sometimes I wish that would happen. Does that shock you?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"And other times I want to pray for him. That he\u0027ll stop drinking and, and, I don\u0027t know what. Get better, I guess. Be the father I always wanted. But maybe he already is the father I always wanted. Maybe he was all along.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\"\\n\\n \"Anyway, I don\u0027t know how to pray. Do you pray?\"\\n\\n \"Once in a while. Not very often, though.\"\\n\\n \"How do you do it?\"\\n\\n \"Mostly I ask for strength.\"\\n\\n \"Strength?\"\\n\\n \"To do something,\" I said, \"or to get through something. That kind of strength.\"\\n\\n \"And do you get it?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"I generally do.\"\\n\\n I showered before I left her place, then got to the basement of St. Paul\u0027s in time for the last half hour of the meeting. I raised my hand and said that I\u0027d thought of drinking earlier. \"I was looking out the window at the liquor store across the street,\" I said, \"and I thought how easy it would be to call them up and tell them to send over a bottle. I\u0027ve been sober a few years now, and I don\u0027t get thoughts like that very often, but I\u0027m still an alcoholic, and I\u0027ve stayed sober this long by not drinking and by coming here and talking about it. And I\u0027m glad I\u0027m sober, and I\u0027m glad I\u0027m here tonight.\"\\n\\n Afterward I joined a few of the others at the Flame. I ate a hamburger and drank a glass of iced coffee. I got home a little before eleven.\\n\\n \"You look a little wilted,\" Elaine said. \"Thank God for air-conditioning, huh? Joe Durkin called, he wants you to call him in the morning. And you had a couple of other messages. I wrote them down. I hope your day was more exciting than mine.\"\\n\\n \"Things were pretty slow?\"\\n\\n \"Well, who wants to go gallery-hopping in this weather? But I think I have a commission for Ray Galindez. A woman in her seventies, a Buchenwald survivor. Her whole family died over there, and of course she doesn\u0027t have any pictures. She came over after the war with the clothes on her back and nothing else. She wants Ray to draw them all- her parents, her grandparents, her little sister. She lost everybody, Matt.\"\\n\\n \"Can she afford it?\"\\n\\n \"She could buy my whole store out of petty cash. She married another camp survivor and they opened a candy store. Her sons went into business together, they have a metal-casting business in Passaic. She has six grandchildren, three doctors and two lawyers.\"\\n\\n \"And one black sheep?\"\\n\\n \"The black sheep is at Harvard picking up an MBA before she moves back to Passaic and starts running the factory. That\u0027s if she doesn\u0027t get sidetracked and decide to become the CEO of General Motors.\"\\n\\n \"You got the whole story, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Complete with pictures. Money\u0027s no problem. Her only worry is that she won\u0027t be able to remember what they look like. \u0027I close my eyes and try to see them, and I don\u0027t see nothing.\u0027 I told her to sit down with the artist and see what happens. She got a little teary at the thought. I tried to comfort her and I started to remember what an emotional experience it was when Ray did the sketch of my father. You should have seen us, honey. Two old broads with our arms around each other, crying about nothing.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re really something.\"\\n\\n \"Me?\"\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027re wonderful.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just another former whore,\" she said, \"with a former heart of gold.\"\\n\\n 9\\n\\n Joe Durkin said, \"Tell me something, because I find myself wondering. Just how did I get to be your rabbi?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose you went to yeshiva,\" I said, \"and studied long and hard.\"\\n\\n \"You know,\" he said, \"that\u0027s the kind of rabbi I should have been. Wear one of those little beanies, stroke my beard anytime I\u0027m stuck for an answer. I wonder if it\u0027s too late for a career change.\"\\n\\n \"I think you have to be Jewish.\"\\n\\n \"I figured there was a catch. It sounded too good to be true.\" He leaned all the way back in his chair with his hands clasped behind his neck. \"Seriously, though,\" he said, \"how was I chosen to be your friend in high places? Your personal tapeworm, deep in the bowels of the NYPD bureaucracy.\"\\n\\n \"Tapeworm,\" I said. \"Jesus.\"\\n\\n He grinned. \"You like that? I thought you would. My other choice was your cat\u0027s-paw, pulling your chestnuts out of the fire. I think I like the tapeworm better.\"\\n\\n We were in the squad room at Midtown North. The desk next to Joe\u0027s was empty. Two desks away, a heavyset black detective named Bellamy was interrogating a skinny Hispanic kid with a wispy goatee on his sharp chin. The kid had a cigarette going and Bellamy kept waving at the smoke, trying to keep it from drifting in his face.\\n\\n \"Four homicide investigations,\" Durkin said. \"Earliest one\u0027s twelve years ago, most recent\u0027s this past February. Four men and a woman killed in different ways in widely separated parts of the city over a twelve-year period. What, I asked myself, could these cases possibly have in common? You want to know what I came up with?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"All of the victims are dead. Still dead, like General Franco. You remember that from Saturday Night Live?\"\\n\\n \"Vaguely.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027This just in from Madrid- Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead.\u0027 \" He made a show of shuffling the papers on his desk. \"Here we go. Carl Uhl, killed by a lover in his West Twenty-second Street apartment. Victim was gay, apartment bore evidence of an S-and-M lifestyle, victim was secured with handcuffs and leather restraints, blah blah blah, multiple stab wounds, genital and pectoral mutilation. You need all this?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-12.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) \\n In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
