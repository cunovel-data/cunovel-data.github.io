{"id":64072,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"I went out for coffee after the meeting with a couple of the others and we continued informally the sharing we\u0027d done at the meeting. I tried Shorter\u0027s number when we arrived at the coffee shop and tried it again fifteen minutes later. I tried it a third time on my way out, which must have been a few minutes after seven. When my quarter came back once again I used it to call Elaine.\n There were no messages for me, she said, and the mail had held nothing of interest. I told her what I was up to, and that I might be out most of the evening. \"If he had an answering machine,\" I said, \"I\u0027d leave a message on it and call him again in a day or two if I didn\u0027t hear from him. But he doesn\u0027t, and I\u0027m in the neighborhood, and it\u0027s not a neighborhood I get to often.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have to explain it to me.\"\n \"I\u0027m explaining it to myself. And it\u0027s not as though he\u0027s likely to have any answers. Any question I\u0027ve got, the Forest Hills cops already asked. So how could he have anything for me?\"\n \"Maybe you\u0027ve got something for him.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"Nothing really. Well, there\u0027s a lecture and slide show at the French church. I might go to that, and if Monica wants to go with me maybe we\u0027ll have a Girls\u0027 Night Out afterward. You\u0027ll be having a late night, won\u0027t you?\"\n \"I might.\"\n \"Because you were going to drop in on Mick, weren\u0027t you? Just so you\u0027re home in time for Marilyn\u0027s Chamber tomorrow night.\"\n \"You still want to go?\"\n \"After the time we had last night?\" I could picture the expression on her face. \"Now more than ever. You\u0027re pretty hot stuff, Mr. Scudder, sir.\"\n \"Now cut that out.\"\n \" \u0027Now cut that out.\u0027 You know who you sound like? Jack Benny.\"\n \"I was trying to sound like Jack Benny.\"\n \"Well, in that case, it wasn\u0027t a very good imitation.\"\n \"You just said-\"\n \"I know what I said. I love you, you old bear. What have you got to say about that?\"\n North of Eighty-sixth Street, the landscape on the Upper East Side is one of a neighborhood in transition, neither Yorkville nor East Harlem but reminiscent of both. Luxury condos rise across the street from low-income public-housing projects, the walls of both impartially scarred by unreadable graffiti. The upwardly mobile stride along with briefcases and grocery bags from D\u0027Agostino\u0027s; others, no less mobile but headed in the opposite direction, shake paper cups of change and drink forty-ounce bottles of malt liquor, or suck on crack pipes that glow like fireflies.\n Shorter\u0027s building turned out to be a six-story brick tenement on Ninety-fourth between Second and Third. In the vestibule I counted over fifty doorbells, each with a slot beside it for the tenant\u0027s name. More than half the slots were empty, and none had Shorter\u0027s name on it.\n Originally the building would have had four rooms to a floor, but over the years they\u0027d been partitioned and the apartment house turned into a rooming house. I\u0027d been in and out of hundreds of such places over the years, and if each was different they were still somehow all the same. The cooking smells in the halls and stairwells changed with the ethnic origin of the inhabitants, but the other smells were a constant throughout the city and through the years. The reek of urine, the odor of mice, the unventilated stench of neglect. Now and then a room in one of those rabbit warrens would turn out to be bright and airy, clean and trim, but the buildings themselves were always dark and sorry and sordid.\n Something like that would have been my next stop after the hotel. If I hadn\u0027t stopped drinking, the day would have come when I couldn\u0027t make the rent or talk them into carrying me until I caught a break. Or I\u0027d have reached a point where, money or no, I no longer had the self-esteem to walk past the desk each day, and would have looked for something more in keeping with my station.\n I asked a man on his way out of the building if he knew a James Shorter. He didn\u0027t even slow down, just shook his head no and kept walking. I asked the same question of a little gray-haired woman who was on her way into the building, walking with a cane and carrying her groceries in one of those mesh bags. She said she didn\u0027t know anyone in the building but that they all seemed to be very nice people. Her breath smelled of mint and booze- peppermint schnapps, I suppose, or a beaker of gin with a breath mint for a chaser.\n I walked to Second Avenue and tried Shorter\u0027s number from a pay phone on the corner. No answer. It struck me that if he wasn\u0027t working he might very well be somewhere having a drink, and the neighborhood afforded plenty of opportunities. There were half a dozen taverns on Second within two blocks of Ninety-fourth Street. I worked my way through them, asking bartenders for James Shorter. Was he in? Had he been in earlier? Nobody knew him, at least not by name, but the bearded fellow behind the stick at O\u0027Bannion\u0027s said he\u0027d heard precious few last names over the years, and not that many first names, either. \"He could be one of these lads, for all I know,\" he said.\n I considered calling out his name. \"James Shorter? Is James Shorter here?\" But then I\u0027d have had to repeat the process in the saloons I\u0027d already covered, and I didn\u0027t feel like it. I\u0027d had enough of their boozy ambience.\n And how about the gin joints on First Avenue? Shouldn\u0027t I go ask for the elusive Mr. Shorter there?\n I might have, but first I tried his number again, and this time he answered.\n I told him my name, said I\u0027d got his from the police and his address and phone from Mr. Banszak at Queensboro-Corona. \"I know you\u0027ve been over this plenty of times,\" I said, \"but I\u0027d appreciate a few minutes of your time. I\u0027m in your neighborhood right now, as it happens, so if I could come by and see you-\"\n \"Oh, let\u0027s meet somewhere,\" he suggested. \"There\u0027s a nice place around the corner on First Avenue, the Blue Canoe. It\u0027s a good place to talk. Say ten minutes?\"\n The Blue Canoe was paneled to look like a log cabin. There were a couple of trophy heads on the wall, a stuffed marlin displayed above the mirrored back bar. The lighting was subdued and indirect, the taped music a mix of jazz and soft rock. The crowd was light and upscale for the neighborhood.\n I stood in the doorway for a moment, looked around, then walked directly to a table where a man sat alone with a glass of beer. I said, \"Mr. Shorter?\" but I already knew that\u0027s who he was. I\u0027d waited for him across the street from his rooming house and tagged him to the bar, then gave him time to settle in before making my own entrance.\n Old habits die hard, I guess.\n We shook hands and I took the seat across from him. I\u0027d formed a mental picture of him- the mind will do that, helpfully conjuring up an image to fit the sense one has of a person. People don\u0027t usually wind up looking much like I\u0027ve pictured them, and he was no exception, being older, darker, and, yes, shorter than I\u0027d had in mind. Late forties, I figured. Five-eight, wiry, with a round face and deep-set eyes. A pug nose, a narrow-lipped mouth. No beard or mustache, but a good two days\u0027 worth of stubble darkening his cheeks and chin. Dark hair, black in the dim light of the Blue Canoe, cut short and combed flat on his round skull. He was wearing a T-shirt, and had a lot of dark hair on his forearms and the backs of his wrists.\n \"It must have been a shock,\" I said. \"Finding Watson\u0027s body.\"\n \"A shock? Jesus, I\u0027ll say.\"\n The waitress came and I ordered a Coke. Then I took out my notebook and we started going over his story.\n There wasn\u0027t a lot to get. He\u0027d gone over it repeatedly with detectives from Queens Homicide and the One-one-two, and he\u0027d had close to five months to forget anything he might have left out. No, he hadn\u0027t seen anybody suspicious in the neighborhood. No, he hadn\u0027t spotted Alan Watson earlier on, heading home from the bus stop. No, he couldn\u0027t think of anything, not a damn thing.\n \"How come you\u0027re checking now?\" he wondered. \"Do you have a lead?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Are you from a different precinct or what?\" He\u0027d assumed I was a cop, an assumption I\u0027d been perfectly willing for him to make. But now I told him I was private.\n \"Oh,\" he said. \"But you\u0027re not with Q-C, are you?\"\n \"Queensboro-Corona? No, I\u0027m independent.\"\n \"And you\u0027re investigating a mugging in Forest Hills? Who hired you, the victim\u0027s widow?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Somebody else?\"\n \"A friend of his.\"\n \"Of Watson\u0027s?\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n He caught the waitress\u0027s eye and ordered another beer. I didn\u0027t much want another Coke but I ordered one anyway. Shorter said, \"I guess people with money see things differently. I was just thinking how if a friend of mine got stabbed on the street, would I hire detectives to find out who did it?\" He shrugged, smiled. \"I guess not,\" he said.\n \"I can\u0027t really talk about my client.\"\n \"No, I can understand that,\" he said. The waitress brought the drinks and he said, \"I guess it\u0027s your own policy, then. Not drinking on duty.\"\n \"How\u0027s that?\"\n \"Well, like if you were a cop, you wouldn\u0027t be drinking on duty. Or private, either, if you worked for somebody like Q-C. But working independent, you can judge for yourself whether you should be having a drink or not having a drink, right? So you\u0027re ordering Coke, I figure it has to be your own policy.\"\n \"Is that what you figure?\"\n \"Or maybe you just like Coca-Cola.\"\n \"It\u0027s all right, but I can\u0027t say I\u0027m crazy about it. See, I don\u0027t drink.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"But I used to.\"\n \"Yeah?\"\n \"I loved it,\" I said. \"Whiskey, mostly, but I probably drank enough beer over the years to float a light cruiser. Do you have a law-enforcement background yourself, Mr. Shorter?\" He shook his head. \"Well, I do. I was a cop, a detective. I drank myself off the police force.\"\n \"Is that right?\"\n \"I never got in trouble for it,\" I said. \"Not directly, but I would have the way I was going. I walked away from it, the job, my wife and kids, my whole life…\"\n I don\u0027t see what he could have for me, I\u0027d told Elaine. Maybe you\u0027ve got something for him, she\u0027d said.\n Maybe I did.\n The way it works is remarkably simple. A day at a time, you don\u0027t drink. You go to meetings and share your experience, strength, and hope with your fellow alcoholics.\n And you carry the message.\n You do that not by preaching or spreading the gospel but by telling your own story- what it used to be like, what happened, and what it\u0027s like now. That\u0027s what you do when you lead a meeting, and it\u0027s what you do one-on-one.\n So I told my story.\n When I was done he picked up his glass. He looked at it and put it down again. He said, \"I drank myself out of the job at Q-C. But I guess you know that.\"\n \"It was mentioned.\"\n \"I was kind of shook, finding the body and all. Not the sort of thing I\u0027m used to, you know what I mean?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"So I was hitting it a little heavy for a while there. It happens, right?\"\n \"It does.\"\n \"General rule, I don\u0027t drink that much.\"\n \"They say it\u0027s not how much you drink,\" I said. \"It\u0027s what it does for you.\"\n \"Have to say it does a lot for me,\" he said. \"Lets me relax, unwind, get some thinking done. That\u0027s some of what it does for me.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-24.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: \n A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) \n In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
