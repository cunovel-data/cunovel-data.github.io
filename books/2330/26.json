{"id":64074,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"At the meeting we\u0027d just attended, I\u0027d bought a meeting book during the secretary\u0027s break, and I went through it now with him, pointing out some meetings in his neighborhood. He asked me which ones I went to, and I told him I went mostly in my neighborhood. \"Every meeting has its own style,\" I said. \"If you try different ones you\u0027ll find out which one suits you best.\" \"Like different bars.\" I gave him my card, one of the minimalist ones with my name and phone number. \"That\u0027s my office,\" I said, \"but when I\u0027m not there the calls get forwarded automatically to my home. If it\u0027s an emergency you can call me any hour, day or night. Otherwise it\u0027s not a good idea to call after midnight. If it\u0027s after midnight and you get antsy, you can always call Intergroup. The number\u0027s in the meeting book, and they\u0027ve got volunteers taking calls around the clock.\" \"You mean just call up and talk to a stranger?\" \"It\u0027s better than picking up a drink.\" \"Jesus,\" he said, \"you\u0027ve given me a lot to think about, you know that? I mean, I didn\u0027t see this coming.\" \"Neither did I.\" \"You called me, I figured what the hell, I\u0027d meet you, drink a glass of beer or two, gab a little, maybe I\u0027d get lucky and you\u0027d spring for the beers. I didn\u0027t figure they\u0027d be the last beers I\u0027d ever have in my life.\" He laughed. \"I\u0027d known that, maybe I\u0027d\u0027ve ordered something imported.\" 18 It was well past midnight by the time I got home. Elaine\u0027s Girls\u0027 Night Out had evidently had an early ending; she was sleeping soundly, and didn\u0027t stir when I got in beside her. I was exhausted- it had been a long day- but the time I\u0027d spent with Jim Shorter had energized me, leaving me tired but wired. My mind was all over the place, and I thought I was going to have to get up and read or watch television to unwind. I was bracing myself to do just that when sleep came along and took me by surprise. Over breakfast I told her how I\u0027d spent the evening. \"I don\u0027t know if he\u0027ll ever get to another meeting,\" I said, \"let alone get sober and stay sober. He says he didn\u0027t drink that much and it didn\u0027t screw him up that badly, and for all I know he\u0027s right. But I\u0027ll tell you, it did me good. They say there\u0027s nothing like working with a newcomer to reinvigorate your own commitment to the program.\" \"Did he have anything helpful on the murder in Forest Hills?\" \"Nothing,\" I said. \"He had a lot of questions and a couple of theories, but he didn\u0027t suggest anything I hadn\u0027t thought of myself. As far as Forest Hills is concerned, I think I\u0027m going to have to go out there. What\u0027s the forecast? Is it going to rain?\" \"Hot and humid.\" \"That\u0027ll be a change, won\u0027t it?\" \"More of the same tomorrow. Possibility of rain on Monday.\" \"That won\u0027t do me any good,\" I said. \"I was hoping it would rain today, or at least threaten to.\" \"Why?\" \"So I could get out of traipsing out to Forest Hills. I ought to see Alan Watson\u0027s widow and I\u0027m not looking forward to it.\" \"No, but you\u0027ll do it,\" she said. \"And if it was raining you\u0027d go out there in the rain, knowing you. It\u0027d be the same trip, only you\u0027d get wet. So you\u0027re lucky it\u0027s only hot and humid.\" \"I\u0027m glad you pointed that out to me.\" \"So enjoy yourself with the widow. What\u0027s the matter? Did I say something wrong?\" \"No, of course not. Although I can\u0027t say I expect to enjoy it.\" \"Whatever, darling. Just so you\u0027re back here by eight this evening. We\u0027ve got a date, remember?\" \"You still want to go?\" \"Uh-huh. We should get there by ten, and we\u0027ll want to have dinner first. Should I cook something for us or do you want to eat someplace downtown?\" I told her not to cook, that there was no end of nice restaurants within a five-minute walk of Marilyn\u0027s Chamber. \"Although for fifty bucks a couple,\" I said, \"you\u0027d think the bastards could feed us.\" \"The body parts are just for show,\" she said. \"It\u0027s considered bad form to eat them.\" I went across the street to my hotel, collected my mail at the desk, went upstairs, and called the number I had for Alan Watson. It rang ten times, unanswered by human being or machine. I sorted my mail, threw out most of it, wrote checks for the rent and phone bill, checked the number with Queens Information to make sure I had it right, then dialed it again and listened to it ring another eight or ten times. I broke the connection and called Lewis Hildebrand. The woman who answered told me he was working and offered to give me his office number. I told her I already had it, and when I dialed Hildebrand answered it himself. \"You\u0027re as bad as I am,\" he said. \"Working on a Saturday. Though I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m working or I just felt like getting out of the house. There\u0027s something extremely relaxing about a suite of offices when you\u0027re the only person around. It feels as though the whole place belongs to me.\" \"Doesn\u0027t it?\" \"Well, yes, in a manner of speaking. But it\u0027s different when I\u0027m the only one here. Late at night, or on a weekend. I had a call from Ray Gruliow.\" \"I was there.\" \"A second call. As of last night, there are still two members he hasn\u0027t been able to reach. Three of the others said they definitely can\u0027t make it on Tuesday, and a fourth has a conflict but will try to be there.\" \"Assuming he can\u0027t work it out, how many is Gruliow expecting?\" \"Eight.\" \"That\u0027s including you and Gruliow?\" \"Yes, and you\u0027ll be the ninth person present. I believe we\u0027ll be expecting you at three-thirty.\" \"I thought three o\u0027clock.\" \"We\u0027ll be getting together at three,\" he said. \"The members. The consensus was that we\u0027d have half an hour together to discuss the situation, and then you\u0027ll join us.\" \"All right,\" I said. \"That sounds good. I don\u0027t know exactly what role I\u0027ll play, but I suppose I\u0027ll be reporting on what I\u0027ve determined and making recommendations as to what I think you ought to do.\" \"I would assume so, yes.\" \"But you\u0027re the man who hired me, so I wanted to give you a preliminary report.\" And I did, going over what I\u0027d learned and what I\u0027d come to suspect, summarizing, running it all down as much for my own benefit as for his. \"It sounds,\" he told me, \"as though you\u0027ve done a great deal.\" \"I know it does,\" I said. \"It sounds that way to me, too. God knows I\u0027ve been busy. I haven\u0027t kept track of my hours, but it seems to me I\u0027ve put a lot of time in.\" \"If you\u0027ve done more work than your retainer covers-\" \"I don\u0027t know if I have or not, and that\u0027s something I don\u0027t want to worry about now. No, the point is I\u0027ve done a lot and I\u0027ve even assembled a fair amount of data, but I\u0027m not sure what it amounts to. Am I any closer to wrapping it up than I was when we sat down to lunch at the Addison Club? I don\u0027t know that I am.\" \"What would constitute \u0027wrapping it up\u0027?\" \"Answering the major questions.\" \"Which are?\" \"Is someone killing off the members? If so, who is he? And where is he, and how can we nail him for it? I\u0027d say those are the main questions. I\u0027m inclined to answer the first question with a tentative yes, but as far as the other questions are concerned, I\u0027m still completely in the dark.\" \"Answering them would constitute bringing the entire case to a conclusion, wouldn\u0027t it?\" \"I guess it would.\" \"So it\u0027s hardly surprising they\u0027re as yet unanswered. There\u0027s another question which I would certainly call a major one, although it\u0027s less a matter for investigation than for decision. Is it time for us to go public? Have we gone as far as we can reasonably expect to go with a discreet, low-profile investigation?\" \"That\u0027s a big question,\" I agreed. \"But it\u0027s not one for me to answer. I\u0027m glad there\u0027ll be eight of you at Gruliow\u0027s house Tuesday. I\u0027d rather there were more. I wish you could all be there.\" \"So do I.\" \"Because the question of where we go from here is one of the things you\u0027ll have to decide,\" I said. \"And I guess that\u0027s when you\u0027ll have to decide it.\" I spent the rest of the day in my room at the Northwestern. Every hour or so I tried the number in Forest Hills, and each time it went unanswered. I made other phone calls throughout the day, and watched the Yankees on the MSG channel. (Elaine asked me once, in all apparent seriousness, why they had named a cable channel after a food additive. Madison Square Garden, I told her. Oh, she said.) Wade Boggs tied it for New York with a rare home run in the top of the ninth. Two innings later, Travis Fryman hit a hard grounder down the third-base line. Boggs bobbled it, then threw it over Mattingly\u0027s head. Fryman wound up on second and scored on a shot to left by Cecil Fielder, all of which made them very happy in Detroit. I turned off the set and the phone rang. It was Jim Shorter. \"I hope I\u0027m not, you know, interrupting anything,\" he said. \"But you gave me your card and said to call anytime.\" \"I\u0027m glad you did,\" I said. \"How\u0027s it going?\" \"Not so bad. I haven\u0027t had a drink yet today.\" \"That\u0027s great, Jim.\" \"Well, it\u0027s early. The day\u0027s not over yet. Anyway, there\u0027s days when I don\u0027t drink at all.\" And, after a pause, \"I went to a meeting.\" \"Good for you.\" \"I guess it was good for me. I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t see how it could have been bad for me, right?\" \"Right. Where\u0027d you go?\" \"The same place we went last night. I put a buck in the basket and I had two cups of coffee and a handful of cookies. You can\u0027t lose on a deal like that, can you?\" \"The price is right.\" He told me about the meeting. The crowd was lighter than last night, he said, but he recognized a couple of the same people. He gave me some highlights from the speaker\u0027s story. \"I wanted to raise my hand,\" he said. \"You could have.\" \"People who\u0027d been sober for less than ninety days were raising their hands and giving their day count and getting a round of applause. I was going to raise my hand and say it was my first day, but I thought, shit, let me wait a few days.\" \"Whatever you\u0027re comfortable with.\" \"Maybe I\u0027ll go again tonight,\" he said. \"Is it okay to go to more than one in a day?\" \"You can go all day long,\" I said. \"There\u0027s no limit.\" \"Are you going? Maybe I could check out a West Side meeting, see if there\u0027s a difference.\" \"I\u0027d like that,\" I said honestly, \"but I\u0027ve got plans tonight.\" \"Another time, then. How\u0027s the case coming?\" \"Let\u0027s say it\u0027s a slow day.\" \"Well, I won\u0027t keep you,\" he said. \"Maybe I\u0027ll, uh, give you a call tomorrow.\" \"Anytime,\" I said. \"I mean it.\" I was crossing the lobby on my way home when I remembered I hadn\u0027t put Call Forwarding back on. I went upstairs, punched in the code, dialed the apartment across the street, and told Elaine I\u0027d be home in two minutes. \"So why call?\" she said. \"Oh, right. Call Forwarding.\" She was already dressed when I got there, wearing the leather outfit she\u0027d modeled for me earlier, along with more perfume and makeup than was her custom. \"What I decided,\" she explained, \"is that a dungeon is no place for understatement.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-26.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
