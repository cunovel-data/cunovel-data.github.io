{"id":64075,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\"You don\u0027t think people will be exercising a little restraint?\" \"I\u0027ll forgive you for that,\" she said, \"but only because I love you. You probably want to shower, and your clothes are laid out for you on the bed.\" I showered and shaved and put on the pair of dark slacks she\u0027d laid out for me, then walked into the living room holding the shirt. \"What\u0027s this?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s a guayabera.\" \"I can see that. Where did it come from?\" \"Yucatбn, originally, except I think this particular one was produced in Taiwan. Maybe it\u0027s Korea. It says on the label.\" \"What I mean is-\" \"I bought it for you. Try it on. Let me see. Hey, it looks great.\" \"What are all these pockets for? And all this piping.\" \"It\u0027s the style. Don\u0027t you like it?\" \"If you\u0027d told me in time,\" I said, \"I could have let my sideburns grow and grown a little mustache. Then, with just the right haircut, I could look like a pimp in a 1940s movie.\" \"I think you look casual yet commanding. It\u0027s a present, incidentally, but you don\u0027t have to thank me.\" \"Good,\" I said. Marilyn\u0027s Chamber was located in the basement of a warehouse on Washington Street. Meat packagers occupied the premises on either side, and across the street. There was no sign to lead you to the club. The green door was unmarked, with a low-wattage red light bulb just above it. It was ten o\u0027clock when we knocked and were admitted by a young man with dark black skin, a shaved head, a sleeveless black jumpsuit, and a black mask. It was a quarter after one when the same young man opened the door and let us out. There was a cab cruising down Washington Street and I stepped to the curb and hailed it. I gave the driver our address and sat back, and when Elaine started to say something I interrupted her to suggest that we ride home in companionable silence. \"I\u0027d rather talk,\" she said. \"I\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t.\" \"Are you afraid I\u0027ll embarrass the driver?\" \"No, I\u0027m afraid-\" \"Because his name is Manmatha Chatterjee. He\u0027s from India, home of the Kama Sutra. His people invented fancy fucking.\" \"Please.\" \"So he\u0027s not going to be embarrassed.\" \"I am.\" \"Besides, if he blushed, who\u0027d know?\" \"God damn it…\" \"I\u0027m whispering,\" she said, \"and he can\u0027t possibly hear me, you silly old bear, you. I\u0027ll stop. I\u0027ll behave. I promise.\" She didn\u0027t say anything the rest of the way. In our elevator she said, \"May I speak now, master? Or do you suppose the elevator is bugged?\" \"I think we\u0027re safe.\" \"I had a good time. And I wasn\u0027t too warm in the leather.\" \"You might have been if you kept the top on.\" \"I suppose. You looked dashing in your guayabera.\" \"Casual yet commanding.\" \"I\u0027ll say. I\u0027m really glad we went. I\u0027ll tell you, it\u0027s going to be a while before you see anything like that on television.\" \"Let us hope.\" \"What I really loved is how ordinary the people looked. I\u0027m not talking about what they were wearing, but the people themselves. You go expecting extras from a Fellini movie and you run into folks who could host a Tupperware party.\" \"Some sexual underground.\" \"But that makes it more exciting,\" she said, \"because it\u0027s more real. With the body piercing, everybody was so matter-of-fact. And it all seems so weird, doesn\u0027t it? Tribal, primitive.\" \"And permanent.\" \"Like tattoos, but more than skin deep. But my ears are pierced, and when you come right down to it, what\u0027s the difference between an earlobe and a nipple?\" \"I give up,\" I said. \"What\u0027s the difference?\" We were in our apartment now. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said, slipping both arms around my waist. \"What\u0027s the difference between mashed potatoes and pea soup?\" \"Anybody can mash potatoes.\" \"I already told you that one, huh?\" \"Many times.\" \"The old jokes are the best jokes. That was fun, wasn\u0027t it? Did you have a good time?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did it upset you when I took my top off?\" \"It surprised me,\" I said. \"It didn\u0027t upset me.\" \"Well, with all those tits in your face, I didn\u0027t want you to forget what mine look like.\" \"No chance of that. Yours were the prettiest.\" She danced away from me. \"Ha,\" she said. \"You\u0027re gonna get laid tonight anyway, kiddo. You don\u0027t have to lie.\" \"Who said I was lying?\" \"Let\u0027s put it this way- if you were Pinocchio, now would be a good time to sit on your nose.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what else surprised me,\" I said. \"I thought we agreed we weren\u0027t going to participate.\" \"So who participated? Oh, you mean the girl-girl stuff? I didn\u0027t think that counted.\" \"Oh.\" \"I sort of got into the spirit of things, I guess. Did it bother you?\" \"I don\u0027t think \u0027bother\u0027 is the right word for it.\" \"Did it upset you?\" \"I\u0027m not sure \u0027upset\u0027 is the right word, either.\" \"Got to you, huh?\" \"Got to me.\" \"Well,\" she said, \"that\u0027s why we went, isn\u0027t it? So it would get to us? You old bear, you. You know what I think I\u0027m going to do? I think I\u0027m going to tie you up. You\u0027re not going to fall asleep this time, are you?\" \"Probably not,\" I said. \"Not for hours.\" 19 Paris Green does a nice brunch on Sundays, with tables set up outside under green-and-white umbrellas. We slept late and started the day there. Then Elaine took a cab to the Sixth Avenue weekend flea market to resume the hunt for urban folk art. I had a second cup of coffee and walked back home. Jim Shorter had called in our absence, leaving a message on the machine. I rang him back and arranged to meet him in an hour at a meeting at Amsterdam and Ninety-sixth. Then I called another Jim, my sponsor, Jim Faber, to confirm our dinner date and decide which Chinese restaurant to favor with our presence. We wound up at Vegetarian Heaven, on Fifty-eighth a few doors west of Eighth. The restaurant is a flight below street level, and the chambered dining room is cavernous, with no end of booths and tables, most of them empty. \"I\u0027m glad we got here,\" Jim said. \"I\u0027ve been meaning to try this place but it looks so tacky from the outside. Do they ever do any business? I hope they\u0027re heroin importers and this is just a sideline.\" \"Sometimes they get a crowd at lunch. Elaine loves the place because she can order anything on the menu. Most Chinese restaurants have the same four or five vegetable dishes, and she gets tired of them.\" \"She could come here forever,\" he said, paging through the menu. \"You want to order, since you\u0027re familiar with the place?\" \"Sure. What are you in the mood for?\" \"Food,\" he said. \"Good food, and plenty of it.\" While we ate, I talked about how I\u0027d spent the afternoon, and how an unpromising sidetrack in a difficult investigation had turned into an unintended Twelfth Step call. \"It\u0027s not like you,\" Jim said. \"You\u0027ve never displayed a whole lot of missionary zeal.\" \"Well, I never figured it was my job to sober up the world,\" I said. \"Early on I wasn\u0027t all that sure if I wanted sobriety for my own self, so the last thing I was going to do was try selling it to somebody else. Then, the longer I stayed away from a drink, the more convinced I became that it was none of my goddamn business whether or not other people drank. Maybe the ones who drink are better off drinking. Who am I to say?\" \"Your friend Ballou-\" \"My friend Mick Ballou drinks heavily every day of his life, and if he ever walked into a meeting there\u0027s nobody who would dream of telling him he was in the wrong place. And I\u0027m sure it\u0027s affecting him physically and mentally, even if he\u0027s not showing it yet. But he\u0027s a grown-up, for Christ\u0027s sake. He can make his own decisions.\" \"But with this fellow uptown-\" \"I guess I identified with him,\" I said. \"I looked at his life, or what I figured his life must be, and saw how I could have followed a similar path. Anyway, I didn\u0027t set out to drag him to a meeting. I just found myself talking about it, and he seemed interested, and open to suggestion.\" \"I think it\u0027s good for you. You\u0027re not sponsoring anybody else, are you?\" \"I\u0027m not sponsoring him.\" \"Well, it sounds to me like you are, whether either of you are calling it that or not. I think it\u0027ll do you good to be working with a newcomer. Just don\u0027t be surprised when he drinks.\" \"No.\" \"You can\u0027t get anybody sober and you can\u0027t keep anybody sober. You know that.\" \"Sure.\" \"And I hope you remember the definition of successful sponsorship.\" \"That\u0027s when the sponsor stays sober.\" \"You\u0027re damn right it is. You know, this stuff fools you. You think you\u0027re eating meat but you\u0027re not. This here is supposed to be what, eel?\" \"I think they make it out of soy.\" \"There\u0027ll come a day,\" he said, \"when they make everything out of soy. Chairs, tables, automobiles, hot turkey sandwiches. Everything. But this is supposed to look and taste like eel, and the thing is if it was the genuine article I wouldn\u0027t have anything to do with it, because I don\u0027t happen to like eel. I think I\u0027m marginally allergic to it.\" \"You should have said something when I was ordering it.\" \"But if it\u0027s fake eel, what\u0027s the difference? I\u0027m not allergic to fake eel. As a matter of fact, I like it.\" \"Have some more.\" \"I intend to. Elaine eats like this all the time, huh? I don\u0027t mean this stuff, I mean vegetarian. She doesn\u0027t even eat fish, does she?\" \"No.\" \"I\u0027d miss meat myself. Everything good with you two?\" \"Everything\u0027s great.\" \"You still seeing the other one?\" \"Now and then.\" At first I hadn\u0027t told him about Lisa, but not for fear of his disapproval. He knows Elaine, and I didn\u0027t want to burden him with something I had to keep secret from her, especially if it was something that would end in a couple of weeks. When it didn\u0027t, when it went on and on, I talked about it. \"The last time I saw her,\" I said, \"I started out wanting a drink. I called her instead.\" \"Well, if those were the two choices, I\u0027d say you picked the right one. I don\u0027t know that the relationship has much of a future, but I watched a PBS special last night on the greenhouse effect, and you could say the same thing about the human race. She\u0027s not likely to try to break up your marriage, is she?\" \"I\u0027m not married.\" \"You know what I mean.\" I nodded. \"She\u0027s just there,\" I said. \"She never calls, and when I call she says to come over.\" \"Sounds like the answer to a prayer,\" he said. \"Do me a favor, will you? Find out if she\u0027s got a sister.\" We sat a long time over dinner and arrived a few minutes late for the Big Book meeting at St. Clare\u0027s. Afterward I walked Jim home, then kept going to Grogan\u0027s Open House at Fiftieth and Tenth. Mick Ballou owns the place, although you won\u0027t find his name on the license. He has a farm in Sullivan County, a couple of hours from the city, and another man\u0027s name is on the deed. He has a couple of apartments around town, too, and drives a Cadillac Brougham, but for the record he doesn\u0027t own a thing. When they finally make their RICO case against him, they\u0027ll be hard put to find anything to confiscate.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-27.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
