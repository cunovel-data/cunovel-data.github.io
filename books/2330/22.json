In the passenger seat, \u0027cept they should be callin\u0027 it somethin\u0027 else, \u0027cause you a passenger in a cab, you ride in the back, Jack. But he was ridin\u0027 up front with the driver.\"\\n\\n \"How far away was she?\"\\n\\n \"Two, three doors down the street. She showed me the candystore they was standin\u0027 in front of, her an\u0027 her friends. \u0027Splained to me how Melissa Mikawa could do a stand-up interviewin\u0027 her in front of the store. Man, she coulda been Melissa Mikawa\u0027s assistant, all the media trash she was talkin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"What did he look like?\"\\n\\n \"White.\"\\n\\n \"Tall, short, fat, thin, young, old-\"\\n\\n \"Just white. But don\u0027t forget-\"\\n\\n \"It was four years ago and she was a kid, right. You think I\u0027d get anywhere putting her together with Ray Galindez?\"\\n\\n \"So Elaine\u0027ll have another picture to hang up in the shop? I can see her gettin\u0027 into it, but what comes out might be more imaginin\u0027 than rememberin\u0027. She\u0027d swear he had tits an\u0027 a tail if it\u0027d get her on New York One.\"\\n\\n \"I probably ought to talk to her.\"\\n\\n \"Like you a cop? Or like you workin\u0027 for Miss Mikawa also?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be an assistant news director,\" I said. \"How\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n He considered, then nodded. \"I\u0027ll go get my polo shirt and my khakis,\" he said. \"An\u0027 my penny loafers. I meant to bring \u0027em anyway so\u0027s I can leave \u0027em at Elaine\u0027s.\" He eyed my clothing. \"Maybe you could dress up a little yourself,\" he said, \"so we don\u0027t start no rumors about New York One\u0027s on the skids.\"\\n\\n I put on a blue blazer, and New York One\u0027s sartorial reputation stayed unsullied. We rode uptown on the A train and spent forty minutes finding Sombrita Pardo and another half hour getting her story between bites of sausage pizza at a pizza parlor adjacent to the candy store in front of which she\u0027d been standing four years earlier. She was a little dumpling with glossy black hair, olive skin, Indio features, and surprising light brown eyes. Her name meant Little Shadow, she said, which was kind of silly and she used to hate it, but now she was beginning to like it because it was like different.\\n\\n Her story didn\u0027t change. The man who got out of the metered cab was white, and that was as much of a physical description as she could provide. And he\u0027d emerged from the front passenger seat, and she\u0027d had the feeling that he was going to run an errand and return to the cab, but he walked around the corner and disappeared. And then she had to go home, and she forgot about it, and the next day she heard that there was all this commotion, police cars and everything, and it turned out the driver was dead. He\u0027d been shot, or so they said, but couldn\u0027t he have just had a heart attack or something? And maybe the friend had gone for help, and-\\n\\n And just forgot to come back?\\n\\n Well, she said, maybe, you know, he OD\u0027d, the driver, that is, and the friend decided he didn\u0027t want to get involved, so he, like, 911\u0027d it in and went home. Except she knew they found bullets in him, or at least that\u0027s what she heard, but you heard lots of things, and how did you know what to believe?\\n\\n How indeed?\\n\\n Fifteen or twenty minutes in TJ excused himself to go to the john, at which point Little Shadow grew at once older and younger. She straightened up in her seat and said, \"Be honest with me? I\u0027m not gonna be on TV, am I?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid not.\"\\n\\n \"Are you cops? You could be a cop, but no way Mr. T. J. Smith\u0027s a police officer. \u0027Course, I never thought he was Melissa Mikawa\u0027s assistant, either.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s too young and too street for that. You got to go to college to get a job like that, don\u0027t you? He never went to college.\"\\n\\n As I said, older than her years. Then I asked her why, if she saw through his act, she\u0027d been so cooperative. \"Well, he\u0027s real cute,\" she said, and giggled, and looked about twelve years old.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m an insurance investigator,\" I said. \"Mr. Smith\u0027s a trainee. No need to let him know that you, uh, saw through his act.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I wouldn\u0027t,\" she said, and sucked the last of her Coke through her straw. \"Insurance? I hope I didn\u0027t get anybody in trouble.\"\\n\\n \"Certainly not.\"\\n\\n \"Or keep someone from getting their money.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s really just a matter of getting the paperwork straightened out,\" I said, \"and maybe saving the company a few tax dollars.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, well,\" she said. \"That\u0027s good, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n 15\\n\\n We got on the A train and split up at Columbus Circle. TJ was on his way to the shop to show Elaine how he looked in his Young Man of Promise costume. I walked over to Midtown North to look for Durkin. I caught him at his desk, eating a sandwich and drinking bottled iced tea.\\n\\n \"Thomas Cloonan,\" I said. \"Playwright, part-time cabdriver, shot and killed four years ago, Audubon Avenue and 174th Street, guy they tagged for it never went to trial-\"\\n\\n \"Jesus,\" he said. \"What am I, the central figure in a granny-dumping? You figure me for no short-term memory at all?\"\\n\\n \"I just wanted to refresh your memory.\"\\n\\n \"It hasn\u0027t had time to get stale. We just talked about the son of a bitch the other day.\"\\n\\n \"What did Cloonan do to become a son of a bitch?\"\\n\\n \"Not Cloonan, for chrissake. The shooter.\" His eyes narrowed in concentration. \"Mims,\" he said. \"How\u0027s that for memory, considering it\u0027s a case I got no reason to give a shit about?\"\\n\\n \"You want to try for the first name?\"\\n\\n \"Obadiah.\"\\n\\n \"Try Eldoniah.\"\\n\\n \"Well, fuck, I came close enough. What about him?\"\\n\\n \"The guy who shot Cloonan was white.\"\\n\\n I gave him what I had. It wasn\u0027t his case- it wasn\u0027t anybody\u0027s case at this stage- but he was too much of a cop not to take an interest, sifting data, proposing and discarding theories.\\n\\n \"Front-seat passenger,\" he said. \"Who rides up front?\"\\n\\n \"In Australia,\" I said, \"when you get a cab, you automatically sit in front next to the driver.\"\\n\\n \"Because the rear springs are shot?\"\\n\\n \"Because there\u0027s no class system, and you\u0027re all mates. Getting in back would be a snub.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah? What\u0027s the chances you got an Australian shooting cabbies and robbing them?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it makes a refreshing change from Norwegians.\"\\n\\n \"All that aside, implication\u0027s the shooter\u0027s a friend of the driver, right?\"\\n\\n \"Known to him, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Front-seat passenger, meter\u0027s not running, no entry on the log sheet. He had a pickup in Midtown, long haul up to Columbia Presbyterian. How\u0027s the shooter know he\u0027s gonna be there?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Tommy, next fare you get anywhere near the neighborhood, drop by the Emerald Grill, I got something to talk about with you.\u0027 \"\\n\\n He thought about it. \"I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s about as hard to swallow as the Crocodile Dundee theory.\"\\n\\n \"Or it\u0027s Cloonan\u0027s idea. He\u0027s in the neighborhood, so he decides to look up his friend.\"\\n\\n \"Who latches on to the opportunity to kill him.\" He took a swig of iced tea. \"Raspberry-flavored,\" he said. \"All of a sudden there\u0027s, I don\u0027t know, a dozen, fifteen different flavors of iced tea. I used to think, why do we fill up the shelves with so many different choices? How are we gonna keep up with the fucking Russians if we\u0027re dicking around with flavored tea while they\u0027re building tanks and going to the moon? So their whole system fell apart and we\u0027re working on ten more flavors and doing fine. Which shows what I know about anything.\" He took another drink and said, \"How reliable\u0027s your witness?\"\\n\\n \"On a ten scale,\" I said, \"somewhere between zero and one.\"\\n\\n \"What I figured. Shooter gave Cloonan two in the back of the head. How do you manage that, you\u0027re sitting next to the guy?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Hey, Tom, what\u0027s that out the window?\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"He turns to look, bang bang. Yeah, I suppose. I\u0027d have to see the lab report. Why would he do that, though? So it would look like the shot came from the rear seat?\"\\n\\n \"Or just so Cloonan wouldn\u0027t see it coming.\"\\n\\n \"Makes sense. Try this. Shooter\u0027s in the back, cab pulls to the curb, shooter puts a pair in Cloonan. Then he gets out, and then he gets back in, next to the driver this time, and grabs the wallet and the coin changer, whatever else he\u0027s after. Then he gets out a second time, and that\u0027s when Carmen Miranda gets a look at him.\"\\n\\n \"It could be.\"\\n\\n \"Or try this on. Same opening, two shots from the backseat, and the shooter slips out from the rear on the street side, so nobody talking trash in front of the candy store ever gets a look at him. Maybe he\u0027s from the same town in Norway as Obadiah, pardon me, Eldoniah, or maybe he\u0027s Hispanic like the neighborhood, and either way he walks around the corner and disappears.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And then you have this white guy walking down the street, and he wants to get a cab, and who can blame him, a white guy in that neighborhood?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a bad neighborhood.\"\\n\\n \"Can we just accept the idea that a white guy on that block might just as soon get in a taxi? He sees this cab, and there\u0027s a man behind the wheel, and he opens the door to ask if the guy\u0027s waiting for a fare.\"\\n\\n \"And he sees the driver\u0027s dead.\"\\n\\n \"Right. And he does what most people would do, especially out of their own neighborhood, which is get the hell out of there, because who wants to be a witness, and maybe he was up in the Heights buying dope or getting laid, so why get involved?\"\\n\\n \"And the witness didn\u0027t see him until he was getting out of the cab?\"\\n\\n \"Why would she?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"She doesn\u0027t see the shooter get out of the cab and she doesn\u0027t see the white guy get in.\"\\n\\n \"Why should she? She\u0027s got other things on her mind.\"\\n\\n \"I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Basically,\" he said, \"you haven\u0027t got anything, have you?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"In terms of evidence, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"Not even close.\"\\n\\n \"But if you\u0027re trying to build a case that a single killer did these four people-\"\\n\\n \"Five, with Shipton\u0027s wife.\"\\n\\n \"- then this doesn\u0027t slow you down any. I can\u0027t recommend you talk to anybody up in the Three-four, though. They got enough open files, they don\u0027t have to get cracking on one of the closed ones.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Unless you wanted to go on the record. Reopen all those cases at once. If your client\u0027ll go for it.\"\\n\\n \"My client and some of his friends are meeting in a couple of days to see what they want to do.\"\\n\\n \"What, all twenty-six of them?\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027d you get twenty-six?\"\\n\\n \"Thirty guys, four of them killed. That leaves twenty-six, right?\" He grinned. \"Nothing wrong with this granny\u0027s short-term memory.\"\\n\\n \"The arithmetic\u0027s wrong.\" He looked at me. \"Thirty minus four equals-\"\\n\\n \"Fourteen.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"There were four murders,\" I said, \"and twelve other deaths.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of deaths?\"\\n\\n \"A few suicides, a few accidents. A few resulting from illness.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-22.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) \\n In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
