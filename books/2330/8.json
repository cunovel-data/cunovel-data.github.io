{"id":64056,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"In the morning I deposited Lewis Hildebrand\u0027s check and walked over to the main library at Fifth and Forty-second. A young woman with the unfocused energy of a marijuana smoker got me set up at a table and showed me how to thread the microfiche rolls into the scanner. It took me a couple of tries to get the hang of it, but before long I was all caught up in it, lost in yesterday\u0027s news. The next thing I knew it was almost 2:30. I bought a stuffed pita from one sidewalk vendor and an iced tea from another and sat on a bench in Bryant Park, just behind the library. For several years the little park had flourished as the epicenter of the midtown drug trade. It got so no one went into it but the dealers and their customers, and it had degenerated into a nasty and dangerous eyesore. Just over a year ago it had been born again, with a couple of million dollars spent to re-create it. An architect\u0027s heroic vision had been brought to life, and now the park was a showplace, and an absolute oasis in that part of town. The junkies were gone, the dealers were gone, the lawn was lush and green, and beds of red and yellow tulips made you forget where you were. The city\u0027s falling apart. The water mains keep bursting, the subways break down, the streets are cratered with potholes. Much of the population is housed in rotting tenements, scheduled for demolition sixty years ago and still standing. The housing projects that went up after the war are crumbling themselves now, in worse shape than the hovels they were built to replace. Living here, it\u0027s very easy to find yourself seeing the decline as a one-way street, a road with no turning. But that\u0027s only half of it. If the city dies a little every day, so is it ever being reborn. You can see the signs everywhere. There\u0027s the subway station at Broadway and Eighty-sixth, its tile walls bright with the paintings of schoolchildren. There\u0027s the wedge-shaped garden in Sheridan Square, the pocket parks blooming all over town. And there are the trees. When I was a kid you had to go to Central Park if you wanted to stand under a tree. Now half the streets in town are lined with them. The city plants some and property owners and block associations plant the rest. Trees don\u0027t have an easy time of it here. It\u0027s like raising kids in the Middle Ages, you have to plant half a dozen trees to raise one. They die for lack of water, or get snapped off at the base by careless truckers, or choke to death in the polluted air. Not all of them, though. Some of them survive. It was a treat to sit on a bench in that little bandbox of a park and think that maybe my town wasn\u0027t such a bad place after all. I\u0027ve never been too good at looking on the bright side. Mostly I tend to notice the rot, the collapse, the urban entropy. It\u0027s my nature, I guess. Some of us see the glass half full. I see it three-fourths empty, and some days it\u0027s all I can do to keep my hands off it. I went back to the library after lunch and put in another three hours, and that was my routine for the rest of the week, long sessions looking up old newspaper stories interrupted by lunches in the park. At first I concentrated on those members who had unquestionably been murdered, Boyd Shipton, Carl Uhl, Alan Watson, and Tom Cloonan. Then I went looking for any sort of coverage of the thirteen others who had died, and then I started in on the living. I took the weekend off. Saturday afternoon I spelled Elaine while she scouted out thrift shops in Chelsea and a flea market in a school yard on Greenwich Avenue. I made a couple of small sales, and in the middle of the afternoon Ray Galindez dropped by with two containers of coffee, and we sat and talked for a while. He\u0027s a police artist with an uncanny ability to depict people he\u0027s never seen, and Elaine has some of his sketches hanging, along with a notice of his availability for portraits from memory. He had done a remarkable drawing of Elaine\u0027s father, working with her over several sessions; that had been my gift to her one Christmas, and it was not on view at the gallery, but stood in a gilt frame on top of her dresser. Saturday night we saw a play at one of the little houses way west on Forty-second Street. Sunday afternoon I watched three baseball games at once, flipping from channel to channel, working the remote like a kid playing a video game, and to about as much purpose. Sunday night I had my usual Chinese meal with Jim Faber, my AA sponsor. Afterward we went to the Big Book meeting at St. Clare\u0027s Hospital. During the sharing, one fellow said, \"I\u0027ll tell you what it means to be an alcoholic. If I went into a bar and there was a sign that said, \u0027All You Can Drink- One Dollar,\u0027 I\u0027d say, \u0027Great- give me two dollars\u0027 worth.\u0027 \" Monday I was back at the library. Monday night I stopped by my hotel and picked up a message from Wally at Reliable, the agency that has some work for me now and then. I called in the next morning. They wanted me to give them a couple of days, scouting out witnesses in a product-liability case. I said I\u0027d do it. The job I was doing for Hildebrand wasn\u0027t that urgent that I couldn\u0027t fit in other assignments along the way. The plaintiff in the product-liability case contended that his deck chair had collapsed, with painful results and dire long-term consequences. We were working for the company that had manufactured the chair. \"The chair\u0027s a piece of crap,\" Wally told me, \"but that don\u0027t mean the guy\u0027s on the up-and-up. An\u0027 he\u0027s got this personal-injury lawyer, Anthony Cerutti, scumbag goes around reporting damaged sidewalks on Thursday, putting the city on notice so his clients can trip over them on Friday and bring suit. Our client would love to stick this one straight up Cerutti\u0027s ass, so whyntcha see what you can do.\" The injured party had driven a UPS truck before the accident and hadn\u0027t worked since. I found out that he never left his house much before two in the afternoon, so I arranged my own schedule accordingly, putting in a few hours in the library each morning, then catching the F train to the Parsons Boulevard stop. I generally managed to be nursing a Coke in McAnn\u0027s Hillside Tavern when our man paused at the door, shifted both clear plastic canes to his left hand, drew the door open with his right, then hobbled in with a cane in each hand. \"Hey, Charlie,\" the bartender told him each and every time. \"You know somethin\u0027? I think you\u0027re walkin\u0027 better.\" I would slip out for a while and find people to talk to, and before I headed for home I would stop back at McAnn\u0027s for another Coke. After a couple of days of this I told Wally I was pretty certain Charlie wasn\u0027t working anywhere, on or off the books. \"Shit,\" he said. \"You think he\u0027s legit?\" \"No, I think the limp\u0027s bogus. Let me put in another day or two.\" The following Monday I showed up around noon at Reliable\u0027s offices in the Flatiron Building. \"I had a hunch,\" I told Wally. \"Saturday night I took Elaine to Jackson Heights for curry, and afterward we went looking for Charlie.\" \"You took her to McAnn\u0027s Hillside? That must have been a rare treat for her.\" \"Charlie wasn\u0027t there,\" I said, \"but the bartender thought he might be at Wallbanger\u0027s. \u0027A bunch of \u0027em went over there,\u0027 he said. \u0027They got that Velcro shit.\u0027 \" \"What Velcro shit?\" \"The kind where they\u0027ve got a patch of it on the wall, and you attach some to yourself, and you take a running leap at the wall. The object is to wind up sticking to the wall, generally upside down.\" \"Jesus Christ,\" he said. \"Why, for God\u0027s sake?\" \"That\u0027s not the question you\u0027re supposed to ask.\" \"It\u0027s not?\" He thought about it, and his face lit up. He looked like a kid confronting a gaily wrapped birthday present. \"Oh, boy,\" he said. \"This is the son of a bitch never takes a step without both canes, right? Did he do it, Matt? Did he wrap up in fucking Velcro an\u0027 take a flying leap at a rolling doughnut? Tell me he did it.\" \"He came in second.\" \"Come on.\" \"They were egging him on,\" I said. \" \u0027C\u0027mon, Charlie boy, you gotta try it!\u0027 He kept telling them to be serious, he couldn\u0027t even walk, how could he go stick himself on the wall. Finally somebody brought over a glass with four or five ounces of clear liquor in it. Vodka, I suppose, or maybe Aquavit. They told him it was holy water straight from Lourdes. \u0027Drink it down and you\u0027re cured, Charlie. Miracle time.\u0027 He said, well, maybe, as long as we all understood it was just a temporary cure. A five-minute cure, like Cinderella, and then we\u0027re all pumpkins again.\" \"Pumpkins, for chrissake.\" \"He\u0027s a tall, skinny guy,\" I said, \"with a potbelly from the beer. According to the paperwork he\u0027s thirty-eight, but looking at him you\u0027d say early thirties. The way the thing works, you run up, hit the mark, and take off. On his approach he looked as though he could have been a hurdler in high school, the way he moved those long legs. He only missed winning by two or three inches, and they tried to talk him into taking another turn, but he wouldn\u0027t have any part of it. \u0027Are you kidding, man? I\u0027m a cripple. Now, listen, all of you. Nobody ever saw this, right? It never happened.\u0027 \" \"Ah, Matty, you\u0027re beautiful. You actually saw this, right? And what about Elaine? Can she give a deposition, or testify in court if it comes to that?\" I dropped an envelope on his desk. \"What the hell is this?\" He opened it. \"I don\u0027t believe this.\" \"I\u0027d have been here earlier,\" I said, \"but I stopped at the one-hour photo place first. The light wasn\u0027t great, and it was no time to start popping flashbulbs, so it\u0027s no prizewinner. But-\" \"I call it a prizewinner,\" Wally said. \"If I\u0027m the judge, I give it First Fucking Prize, and while you\u0027re at it you can throw in the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. That\u0027s him, by Christ. Upside down, and stuck to the wall like he\u0027s fucking pinned there. Well, scratch one lawsuit. What a stupid son of a bitch.\" \"He figured he was safe. He knew everybody in the joint except me and Elaine, and he\u0027d gotten used to seeing me at McAnn\u0027s.\" \"I still can\u0027t believe you got a picture. I\u0027m surprised you even had a camera along, never mind you got a chance to use it.\" He held the photo to the light. \"This isn\u0027t so bad,\" he said. \"When I take pictures of my grandkids I have the light positioned just right, I pose \u0027em, and the shots don\u0027t come out any better than this. The kids always manage to move just as I\u0027m clicking the shutter.\" \"You should try Velcro.\" \"Now you\u0027re talking. Glue the little bastards to the wall.\" He dropped the photo on his desk. \"Well, that\u0027s one in the eye for Phony Tony. He can call his client, tell him to see if he can get his job back at UPS, because his days as a professional invalid are over. Good job, Matt.\" \"I think I should get a bonus.\" He thought about it. \"You know,\" he said, \"you fucking well ought to. That\u0027s up to the client, but I can certainly recommend it. This isn\u0027t just a case of digging up some eyewitness, some neighbor lady with a resentment who\u0027s willing to swear she saw him walk down to the corner without the canes. This is the kind of thing where all you really have to do is show Tony Cerutti what you\u0027ve got and he drops the case like a hot rock.\" \"Imagine what Cerutti would pay for the picture.\" \"Now let\u0027s not even get into that,\" he said. \"What did you have in mind?\" \"That\u0027s up to the client,\" I said. \"He can figure out what it\u0027s worth. But along with it I want a letter to me personally expressing appreciation for the work that I did.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-8.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
