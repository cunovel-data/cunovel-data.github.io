{"id":64092,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"I sat down and waited.\\n\\n The time would have passed faster if I could have read a book from the Tierneys\u0027 enormous library, but I didn\u0027t want to risk a light in the window. I left the television set off for the same reason. The boredom was part of the territory, but fatigue was a problem. My mind drifted, and my eyes kept wanting to close. I went into the kitchen, looking for something that might keep me awake, and found a half-full sack of unground coffee beans in the refrigerator. I stuck a handful in my pocket, chewing one from time to time. I don\u0027t know what did more for me, the caffeine or the bitter taste, but one way or another my eyes stayed open.\\n\\n Some forty-five minutes after I got there, TJ\u0027s beeper sounded. We\u0027d worked out a whole system of two-digit signals, but he\u0027d punched in a whole seven-digit number. I picked up the phone and dialed it.\\n\\n He answered the instant it rang. His voice pitched low, he said, \"We in the movies. I followed him over to Broadway an\u0027 down. You know how people keep lookin\u0027 over their shoulders, seein\u0027 if they bein\u0027 followed? He didn\u0027t do that.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s probably a good thing.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Cept I thought maybe he\u0027s bein\u0027 slick. Maybe he just goin\u0027 to duck into the movies and then slip out a side exit. Minute he bought the large-size popcorn I knew I didn\u0027t have to worry. Man\u0027s in for the duration, Jason.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re in the theater?\"\\n\\n \"Phone in the lobby. I went in, saw where he\u0027s sittin\u0027. Soon\u0027s I hang up I\u0027ll go back where I can keep an eye on him. Won\u0027t be keepin\u0027 no eye on the screen, tell you that. You know what he had to see?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Jurassic Park.\"\\n\\n \"You already saw that, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Seen it twice. Man, I so sick of dinosaurs. They wasn\u0027t extinct, I\u0027d go out an\u0027 kill \u0027em myself.\"\\n\\n The show was scheduled to break at 10:15, and we added a new signal to our battery of codes. At twenty after ten the beeper sounded and I saw that he\u0027d punched in 5-6, indicating that they had left the theater. In the course of the next hour he beeped me three times, each time with the same code, 2-4, indicating he was still in contact with Severance. Another beep came at ten to twelve, and the 1-1 meant Severance was entering the building.\\n\\n I switched off the beeper. I didn\u0027t want it making any sounds. I moved to a chair to the left of the doorway.\\n\\n I got out the gun, the one I\u0027d been carrying since I got the first call that afternoon. I turned it over in my hands, trying to get accustomed to the feel of it.\\n\\n I put it in my lap and sat there, waiting.\\n\\n I was listening carefully but I didn\u0027t hear any footsteps. The hallway was carpeted and I guess that must have muffled them, because the first warning I had of his presence was the sound of his key in the lock. He opened one lock, and then there was a long pause, just long enough for me to wonder if he\u0027d somehow sensed something. Then I heard his key again and he opened the second lock. I watched the doorknob turn, watched as the door opened inward.\\n\\n He came in, reached automatically to switch on the overhead light, turned automatically to lock the door behind him.\\n\\n I said, \"Severance!\"\\n\\n He spun toward the sound of my voice. I had the gun raised, and as he came around to face me I aimed it at his middle and gave the trigger a squeeze. It made the sound of a small twig snapping.\\n\\n He looked at me, then down at his chest. A three-inch dart hung from his T-shirt. His hand groped for it in slow motion. The fingers would not quite close on the dart. He tried, God how he tried, but he couldn\u0027t do it.\\n\\n Then his eyes glazed over and he fell.\\n\\n I got another dart from the case, loaded the pistol. I stood watching him for a few minutes, then bent over him to check his pulse and respiration. I had brought two sets of handcuffs and I used them both, cuffing his hands together behind his back, cuffing his feet together with the chain looped around a table leg.\\n\\n I went over and picked up the phone.\\n\\n 32\\n\\n When he woke up I was the first thing he saw. I was sitting on a folding metal chair. He was lying on a mattress atop a low plywood platform. His hands and one leg were free, but there was a thick steel cuff fastened around one ankle. A chain was attached to it, its other end anchored to a plate in the floor.\\n\\n \"Matt,\" he said. \"How\u0027d you find me?\"\\n\\n \"You weren\u0027t that hard to find.\"\\n\\n \"I spend two hours watching dinosaurs, I walk in the door, and whammo! What did you get me with, a tranquilizer dart?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, how long was I out? Couple of hours, it must have been.\"\\n\\n \"Longer than that, Jim.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Jim.\u0027 That\u0027s not what you called me just before you shot me.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"You called me another name.\"\\n\\n \"I called you Severance.\"\\n\\n \"Any point in pretending I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about?\"\\n\\n \"Not really.\"\\n\\n \"Of course if there\u0027s a tape recorder running-\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s not.\"\\n\\n \"Because I don\u0027t remember anybody reading me my rights.\"\\n\\n \"Nobody did.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you ought to, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Why? You\u0027re not under arrest. You haven\u0027t been charged with anything.\"\\n\\n \"No? What are you waiting for?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s not going to be a trial.\"\\n\\n \"I get it. You son of a bitch, why didn\u0027t you use a real gun? Why not get it over with?\" He sat up, or started to, and noticed the chain on his leg. With the discovery came the realization that he wasn\u0027t still lying on an Oriental carpet in the Tierneys\u0027 apartment in Morningside Heights.\\n\\n He said, \"What\u0027s this, fucking leg irons? Where the hell am I?\"\\n\\n \"Red Hawk Island.\"\\n\\n \"Red Hook\u0027s no island. It\u0027s just a bad part of town.\"\\n\\n \"Red Hawk, not Hook. It\u0027s a small island in Georgian Bay.\"\\n\\n \"Where the fuck is Georgian Bay?\"\\n\\n \"In Canada,\" I said. \"It\u0027s an arm of Lake Huron. We\u0027re a couple of hundred miles due north of Cleveland.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re telling me a story, right?\"\\n\\n \"Sit up, Jim. Look out the window.\"\\n\\n He swung his legs over the side of the bed, sat up, got to his feet. \"Whew,\" he said, sitting down again. \"Little groggy.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the drugs.\"\\n\\n He stood again, and this time he stayed on his feet. Dragging the chain, he walked over to the room\u0027s single window. \"Pine trees,\" he said. \"There\u0027s a fucking forest out there.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s not Central Park.\"\\n\\n He turned to face me. \"What the hell is this? How\u0027d we get here?\"\\n\\n \"A couple of men carried you out of the Tierney apartment on a stretcher. They loaded you into the backseat of a limousine. You were driven to a private airport in Westchester County, where they transferred you to a private plane. There\u0027s a small landing strip here on Red Hawk Island, and that\u0027s where we touched down. That was around noon when we got here, twelve hours or so after you came home from the movie. It\u0027s almost five in the afternoon now. You\u0027ve been kept unconscious with injections while we got everything ready for you.\"\\n\\n \"And what\u0027s this? A cabin?\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"There\u0027s a main house and several outbuildings. This is one of the outbuildings. The floor\u0027s poured concrete, in case you were wondering, and the metal plate you\u0027re chained to is anchored solidly in it. In case you were wondering.\"\\n\\n \"Message: I ain\u0027t going nowhere.\"\\n\\n \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n He went back to the bed and sat down on it. \"Lot to go through to kill a guy,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Look who\u0027s talking.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"Look at all you went through,\" I said, \"to kill all those men. Why, Jim?\"\\n\\n He was silent for a moment. Then he said, \"You called me Jim all along. That\u0027s the name you met me under, Jim Shorter. It\u0027s funny, \u0027cause that was the one name I stayed away from. For years I\u0027d pick different names, always the same initials, but never Jim, never James. I used Joe a few times, John, Jack. I was Jeremy on one occasion. And Jeffrey, I was Jeffrey when I got Carl Uhl. \u0027Oh, God, Jeff, what are you doing!\u0027 He begged for his life, that cocksucker.\" His grin was quick and nasty. \"All sorts of different names. But I didn\u0027t use the name I was born with once in all that time. Then finally I figured why not, what\u0027s it gonna hurt? So the name you met me under, it turned out to be my real name. The first name, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"What got you started?\"\\n\\n \"Why the hell should I tell you a fucking thing?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been a lot of years,\" I said. \"Isn\u0027t it about time you told somebody?\"\\n\\n \"A lot of years. I got a bunch of \u0027em, didn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you did.\"\\n\\n \"I shoulda just disappeared, you know? Time I met you, I already had this place rented.\"\\n\\n \"This place?\"\\n\\n \"Can you believe it? I think I\u0027m still back on Manhattan Avenue. I already had it arranged to sublet Tierney\u0027s apartment. I was just waiting for them to get on the plane. Soon as that happened, goodbye Jim Shorter, hello Joel Silverman. He\u0027s a nice Jewish boy, Joel is. You know you can trust him to water your plants and not piss on your carpet.\" He laughed. \"Then you turned up. I couldn\u0027t disappear right away, not the way I\u0027d planned. I had to wait for you to lose interest. But instead of shining you on and getting rid of you, I let you take me to a fucking AA meeting. Can you believe that?\"\\n\\n \"And one meeting changed your life.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, right, just like those lamebrains telling their stories. All of a sudden you\u0027re calling me on the phone, I\u0027m calling you on the phone, and how do I get you off my back and quit being Jim Shorter? First I went and did Helen in Forest Hills, because that wasn\u0027t a load of shit about having an affair with her. Widows are pretty easy targets, you know. She\u0027s not the first I got next to after I did the husband. There was a guy named Bayliss you wouldn\u0027t even know was one of mine-\"\\n\\n \"In a hotel room in Atlanta.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, I looked up the wife afterward. Same thing with Helen, such a shock discovering your husband\u0027s body, blah blah blah, next thing you know she\u0027s got her knees up and I\u0027m slippin\u0027 her the salami. I don\u0027t know if I can explain what a pleasure it was. It\u0027s like killing the husband a second time.\"\\n\\n \"And then you killed Helen.\"\\n\\n \"I thought I could keep you from finding out. You were talking about going out to see her, so I figured I\u0027d better see her first. Then afterward I thought, shit, even a good accident\u0027s suspicious. You got to know I\u0027m good at doing accidents. I realized I had to pull the plug on Jim Shorter and disappear, and the hell with whether or not you figured it out. So I thought let\u0027s go out with a bang, let\u0027s be dramatic, and I got that fucking clown of a weatherman.\"\\n\\n \"Gerry Billings.\"\\n\\n \"Asshole. Chirpy little fucker with his bow ties and his million-dollar smile. The look on his face when I shot him. He bought the scene, you know. Thought it was a traffic accident and he was an innocent bystander who was getting shot for no reason at all. I was praying he\u0027d recognize me and go out knowing, but I didn\u0027t have time to waste so I just shot him and got it the fuck over with.\"\\n\\n \"Why kill them, Jim?\"\\n\\n \"You think I need a reason?\"\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027ve got one.\"\\n\\n \"Why should I tell you?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said, \"but I think you probably will.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-44.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) \\n In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
