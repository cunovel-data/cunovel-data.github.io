Were you ever a smoker?\"\n \"Not really.\"\n \"Not really?\"\n \"I never had the habit,\" I explained. \"Maybe once a year I would buy a pack of cigarettes and smoke five or six of them one right after the other. Then I would throw the pack away and not have another cigarette for another year.\"\n \"My God,\" he said. \"I never heard of anyone who could smoke tobacco without getting hooked on it. I guess you just don\u0027t have an addictive personality.\" I let that one pass. \"Quitting was the hardest thing I ever did in my life. Sometimes I think it\u0027s the only hard thing I ever did. I still have dreams where I\u0027ve taken up the habit again. Do you still do that? Have yourself a little cigarette binge once a year?\"\n \"Oh, no. It\u0027s been more than ten years since I had a cigarette.\"\n \"Well, all I can say is I\u0027m glad there\u0027s not an open pack on the table. Matt\"- we were Matt and Lew by now- \"let me ask you something. Have you ever heard of a club of thirty-one?\"\n \"A club of thirty-one,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t suppose that would have anything to do with this club.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard of the restaurant, of course. \u0027Twenty-one.\u0027 I don\u0027t think-\"\n \"It\u0027s not a specific club, like the Harvard Club or the Addison. Or a restaurant like \u0027Twenty-one.\u0027 It\u0027s a particular kind of club. Oh, let me explain.\"\n The explanation was lengthy and thorough. Once he got started, he reported on that evening in 1961 in detail. He was a good storyteller; he let me see the private dining room, the four round tables (eight men each at three of them, six plus Champney at the fourth). And I could see and hear the old man, could feel the passion that animated him and caught hold of his audience.\n I said I\u0027d never heard of an organization anything like what he\u0027d described.\n \"I guess you didn\u0027t hang out much with Mozart and Ben Franklin,\" he said, with a quick grin. \"Or with the Essenes and the Babylonians. I was thinking about that the other night, trying to decide how much of it I believe. I\u0027ve never really researched the subject beyond an occasional desultory hour in a library. And I never came across an organization anything like ours.\"\n \"And no one you\u0027ve mentioned it to has been familiar with anything similar?\"\n He frowned. \"I haven\u0027t mentioned it much,\" he said. \"To tell you the truth, this is the first detailed conversation I\u0027ve ever had on the subject with someone who wasn\u0027t a member himself. There are any number of people who know I get together with a group of fellows once a year for dinner and drinks, but I\u0027ve never talked about the group\u0027s links to the past. Or the death-watch aspect of the whole thing.\" He looked at me. \"I\u0027ve never told my wife or my children. My best friend, we\u0027ve been close for over twenty years, and he has no idea what the club is about. He thinks it\u0027s like a fraternity reunion.\"\n \"Did the old man tell everybody to keep it a secret?\"\n \"Not in so many words. It\u0027s hardly a secret society, if that\u0027s what you mean. But I left Cunningham\u0027s that night with the distinct feeling that this thing I\u0027d become a part of ought to be kept private. And that conviction deepened over the years, incidentally. It was understood early on that you could say anything in that room with the certain knowledge that it would not be repeated. I\u0027ve told those fellows things I haven\u0027t mentioned to anyone else in the world. Not that I\u0027m a man with a lot of secrets to tell or not to tell, but I would say I\u0027m an essentially private person and I guess I withhold a good deal of myself from the people in my life. For Christ\u0027s sake, I\u0027m fifty-seven years old. You must be close to that yourself, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"I\u0027m fifty-five.\"\n \"Then you know what I\u0027m talking about. Guys our age grew up knowing we were supposed to keep our innermost thoughts to ourselves. All the pop psychology in the world doesn\u0027t change that. But once a year I sit around a couple of tables with a bunch of men who are still virtual strangers to me, and more often than not I wind up opening up about something I hadn\u0027t planned on mentioning.\" He lowered his eyes, picked up the saltcellar, turned it in his hands. \"I had an affair a few years back. Not a quick jump on a business trip, there have been a few of those over the years, but a real love affair. It went on for almost three years.\"\n \"And no one knew?\"\n \"You see what I\u0027m getting at, don\u0027t you? No, nobody ever knew. I didn\u0027t get caught and I never told anybody. If she confided in anyone, and I assume she must have, well, we didn\u0027t have friends in common so it\u0027s not material. The point is that I talked about that affair on the first Thursday in May. More than once, too.\" He set the saltcellar down forcefully. \"I told her about the club. She thought it was morbid, she hated the whole idea of it. What she did like, though, was the fact that she was the only person I\u0027d ever told. She liked that part a lot.\"\n He fell silent, and I sipped my coffee and waited him out. At length he said, \"I haven\u0027t seen her in five years. Well, hell, I haven\u0027t had a cigarette in twelve, and I damn well wanted one for a minute there, didn\u0027t I? Sometimes I don\u0027t think anybody ever gets over anything.\"\n \"Sometimes I think you\u0027re right.\"\n \"Matt, would it bother you if I had a brandy?\"\n \"Why should it bother me?\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s none of my business, but it\u0027s hard not to draw an inference. It was Irwin Meisner who recommended you. I\u0027ve known Irwin for years. I knew him when he drank and I know how he stopped. When I asked him how he happened to know you he said something vague, and on the basis of that I wasn\u0027t surprised when you didn\u0027t order a drink. So- \"\n \"It would bother me if I had a brandy,\" I told him. \"It won\u0027t bother me if you have one.\"\n \"Then I think I will,\" he said, and caught the waiter\u0027s eye. After the man had taken the order and gone off to fill it, Hildebrand picked up the saltcellar again, put it down again, and drew a quick breath. \"The club of thirty-one,\" he said. \"I think somebody\u0027s trying to rush things.\"\n \"To rush things?\"\n \"To kill the members. All of us. One by one.\"\n 3\n \"We got together last month,\" he said. \"At Keens Chophouse on West Thirty-sixth Street. That\u0027s where we\u0027ve been holding our dinners ever since Cunningham\u0027s closed in the early seventies. They give us the same room every year. It\u0027s on the second floor, and it looks like a private library. The walls are lined with bookshelves and portraits of somebody\u0027s ancestors. There\u0027s a fireplace, and they lay a fire for us, not that that\u0027s what you necessarily want in May. It\u0027s nice for atmosphere, though.\n \"We\u0027ve been going there for twenty years. Keens almost went under, you know, just when we were beginning to settle in there. That would have been tragic, the place is a New York institution. But they survived. They\u0027re still there, and, well, so are we.\" He paused, considered. \"Some of us,\" he said.\n His glass of Courvoisier was on the table in front of him. He still hadn\u0027t taken a sip. From time to time he would reach for the small snifter, letting his hand cup the bowl, taking the stem between his thumb and forefingers, moving the glass a few inches this way or that.\n He said, \"At last month\u0027s dinner, it was announced that two of our members had died in the preceding twelve months. Frank DiGiulio had suffered a fatal heart attack in September, and then in February Alan Watson was stabbed to death on his way home from work. So we\u0027ve had two deaths in the past year. Does that seem significant to you?\"\n \"Wellâ€¦\"\n \"Of course not. We\u0027re of an age when death happens. What significance could one possibly attach to two deaths within a twelve-month period?\" He took the glass by its stem, gave it a quarter-turn clockwise. \"Consider this, then. In the past seven years, nine of us have died.\"\n \"That seems a little high.\"\n \"And that\u0027s in the past seven years. Earlier, we\u0027d already lost eight men. Matt, there are only fourteen of us left.\"\n Homer Champney had told them he\u0027d probably be the first to go. \"And that\u0027s as it should be, boys. That\u0027s the natural order of things. But I hope I\u0027ll be with you for a little while, at least. To get to know you, and to see you all off to a good start.\"\n As it turned out, the old man lasted well into his ninety-fourth year. He never missed the annual dinner, remaining physically fit and mentally alert to the very end.\n Nor was he the first of their number to die. The group\u0027s first two anniversaries were unmarked by death, but in 1964 they spoke the name and marked the passing of Philip Kalish, killed with his wife and infant daughter three months earlier in a car crash on the Long Island Expressway.\n Two years later James Severance was killed in Vietnam. He\u0027d missed the previous year\u0027s dinner, his reserve unit having been recalled to active duty, and members had joked that an Asian war was a pretty lame excuse for breaking such a solemn commitment. The following May, when they read his name along with Phil Kalish\u0027s, you could almost hear last year\u0027s jokes echoing hollowly against the paneled walls.\n In March of \u002769, less than two months before the annual dinner, Homer Champney died in his sleep. \"If there comes a day when you don\u0027t see me by nine in the morning,\" he\u0027d instructed the staff at his residential hotel, \"ring my suite, and if I don\u0027t pick up then come check on me.\" The desk clerk made the call and had a bellman take over the desk while he went up to Champney\u0027s rooms himself. When he found what he\u0027d feared, he called the old man\u0027s nephew.\n That nephew in turn made the calls his uncle had instructed him to make. On the list were the twenty-eight surviving members of the club of thirty-one. Champney was leaving nothing to chance. He wanted to make sure everyone knew he was gone.\n The funeral was at Campbell \u0027s, and it was the first club funeral Lewis Hildebrand had attended. The overall turnout was small. Champney had outlived his contemporaries, and his nephew- a great-nephew, actually, some fifty years Champney\u0027s junior- was his only surviving relative in the New York area. Besides Hildebrand, the contingent of mourners included half a dozen other members of the thirty-one.\n Afterward, he joined several of them for a drink. Bill Ludgate, a printing salesman, said, \"Well, this is the first of these I\u0027ve been to, and it\u0027s going to be the last. In a couple of weeks we\u0027ll be all together at Cunningham\u0027s, and Homer\u0027ll have his name read with the others, and I guess we\u0027ll talk about him. And that\u0027s enough. I don\u0027t think we should go to members\u0027 funerals. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s our place.\"\n \"I felt I wanted to be here today,\" someone said.\n \"We all did or we wouldn\u0027t be here. But I talked to Frank DiGiulio the other day and he said he wasn\u0027t coming, that he didn\u0027t think it was appropriate. And now I\u0027ve decided I agree with him. You know, back when this thing first got rolling, there were a few members I used to see socially. A lunch now and then, or drinks after work, or even getting together with the wives for dinner and a movie. But I stopped doing that, and when I spoke to Frank I realized it was the first conversation I\u0027d had with any of the group since dinner last May.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-3.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: \n A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) \n In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
