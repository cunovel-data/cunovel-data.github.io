I urge you to regard this one commitment as unalterable. Some of you will have moved away from New York, and may find the prospect of an annual return burdensome. And there may be times when you think of the club itself as silly, as something you have outgrown, as a part of your life you would prefer to cast aside.\n \"Do not do it! The club of thirty-one plays a very small part in any member\u0027s life. It takes up but one night a year. And yet it gives our lives a focus that other men never know. My young brothers, you are links in a chain that reaches back unbroken to the founding of this republic, and you are part of a tradition with its roots in ancient Babylon. Every man in this room, every man ever born, spends his life approaching his death. Every day he takes another step in death\u0027s direction. It is a hard road to walk alone, a much easier road to walk in good company.\n \"And, if your path is the longest and you should turn out to be the last to finish, you have one further obligation. It will be up to you to find thirty young men, thirty fine men of promise, and bring them together as I have brought you together, to forge one more link in the chain.\"\n Repeating Champney\u0027s words three decades later, Lewis Hildebrand seemed a little embarrassed by them. He said that they probably sounded silly, but not when you heard Homer Champney say them.\n The old man\u0027s energy was contagious, he said. You caught his fever, but it wasn\u0027t just a matter of getting swept up in his enthusiasm. Later on, when you\u0027d had a chance to cool off, you still bought what he\u0027d sold you. Because he\u0027d somehow made you understand something you never would have seen otherwise.\n \"There\u0027s one further part of the evening\u0027s program,\" Champney told them. \"We\u0027ll go around the room. Each man in turn will stand up and tell us four things about himself. His name, his present age, the most interesting fact he can tell about himself, and how he feels now, right now, about embarking on this great journey with his thirty fellows.\n \"I\u0027ll begin, although I\u0027ve probably covered all four points already. Let me see. My name is Homer Gray Champney. I\u0027m eighty-five years old. The most interesting thing I can think of about me, aside from my being the surviving member of the club\u0027s last chapter, is that I attended the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901 and shook the hand of President William McKinley less than an hour before he was assassinated by that anarchist, and what was his name? Czolgosz, of course, Leon Czolgosz. Who could forget that poor misguided wretch?\n \"And how do I feel about what we\u0027re doing tonight? Well, boys, I\u0027m excited. I\u0027m passing the torch and I know I\u0027m placing it in good and capable hands. Ever since the last man of the old group died, ever since I got the word, I\u0027ve had the most awful fear of dying before I could carry on my mission. So it\u0027s a great load off my mind, and a feeling of, oh, of a great beginning.\n \"But I\u0027m running off at the mouth. Four sentences, really, is all that\u0027s required, name, age, fact, and feeling. We\u0027ll start at this table, I think, with you, Ken, and we\u0027ll just go around…\"\n \"I\u0027m Kendall McGarry, I\u0027m twenty-four, and the most interesting fact about me is that an ancestor of mine signed the Declaration of Independence. I don\u0027t know how I feel about joining the club. Excited, I guess, and also that it\u0027s a big step, although I don\u0027t know why it should be. I mean, it\u0027s just one night a year…\"\n \"John Youngdahl, twenty-seven. The most interesting…well, just about the only fact about me I can think of these days is I\u0027m getting married a week from Sunday. That\u0027s got my head so scrambled I can\u0027t tell you how I feel about anything, but I have to say I\u0027m glad to be here, and to be a part of all this…\"\n \"I\u0027m Bob Berk. That\u0027s B-e-r-k, not B-u-r-k-e, so I\u0027m Jewish, not Irish, and I don\u0027t know why I seem to feel compelled to mention that. Maybe that\u0027s the most interesting thing about me. Not that I\u0027m Jewish, but that it\u0027s the first thing out of my mouth. Oh, I\u0027m twenty-five, and how do I feel? Like you all belong here and I don\u0027t, but that\u0027s how I always feel, and I\u0027m probably not the only person here who feels that way, right? Or maybe I am, I don\u0027t know…\"\n \"Brian O\u0027Hara, and that\u0027s with an apostrophe and a capital H, so I\u0027m Irish, not Japanese…\"\n \"I\u0027m Lewis Hildebrand. I\u0027m twenty-five. I don\u0027t know if its interesting, but I\u0027m one-eighth Cherokee. As for how I feel, I can hardly say how I feel. I have the sense of being a part of something much larger than myself, something that started before me and will extend beyond my lifetime…\"\n \"I\u0027m Gordon Walser, age thirty. I\u0027m an account executive at Stilwell Reade and Young, but if that\u0027s the most interesting thing about me I\u0027m in trouble Well, here\u0027s something hardly anybody knows about me. I was born with a sixth finger on each hand. I had surgery when I was six months old. You can see the scar on the left hand but not on the right…\"\n \"I\u0027m James Severance… I don\u0027t know what\u0027s interesting about me. Maybe the most interesting thing is that I\u0027m here with all of you right now. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing here, but it sort of feels like a turning point…\"\n \"My name\u0027s Bob Ripley, and I\u0027ve heard all the Believe It or Not jokes…One thought I had before I got here tonight is that it\u0027s morbid to have a club of people who are just waiting to die. But that\u0027s not how it feels at all. I agree with Lew, I have the sense that I\u0027ve become a part of something important…\"\n \"… know it\u0027s superstitious, but the thought keeps coming to me that forcing ourselves to be aware of the inevitability of death will just make it come along sooner…\"\n \"… a car accident the night of high school graduation. There were six of us in my best friend\u0027s Chevy Impala and everybody else was killed. I got a broken collarbone and a couple of superficial cuts. That\u0027s the most interesting thing about me, and it\u0027s also how I feel about tonight. See, that was eight years ago, and I\u0027ve had death on my mind ever since…\"\n \"… I think the only way to describe how I feel is to say that the only other time I felt anything like this was the night my baby daughter was born…\"\n Thirty men, ranging in age from twenty-two to thirty-two. All of them white, all of them living in or around New York City. They\u0027d all had some college, and most had graduated. More than half were married. More than a third had children. One or two were divorced.\n Now, thirty-two years later, more than half of them were dead.\n 2\n By the time I met Lewis Hildebrand, thirty-two years and six weeks after he became a member of the club of thirty-one, he had lost a lot of hair in front and thickened considerably through the middle. His blond hair, parted on the side and slicked back, was silver at the temples. He had a broad, intelligent face, large hands, a firm but unaggressive grip. His suit, blue with a chalk stripe, must have cost a thousand dollars. His wristwatch was a twenty-dollar Timex.\n He had called me late the previous afternoon at my hotel room. I still had the room, although for a little over a year I\u0027d been living with Elaine in an apartment directly across the street. The hotel room was supposed to be my office, although it was by no means a convenient place to meet clients. But I\u0027d lived alone in it for a good many years. I seemed to be reluctant to let go of it.\n He told me his name and said he\u0027d got mine from Irwin Meisner. \"I\u0027d like to talk to you,\" he said. \"Do you suppose we could meet for lunch? And is tomorrow too soon?\"\n \"Tomorrow\u0027s fine,\" I said, \"but if it\u0027s something extremely urgent I could make time this evening.\"\n \"It\u0027s not that urgent. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s urgent at all. But it\u0027s very much on my mind, and I don\u0027t want to put it off.\" He might have been talking about his annual physical, or an appointment with his dentist. \"Do you know the Addison Club? On East Sixty-seventh? And shall we say twelve-thirty?\"\n The Addison Club, named for Joseph Addison, the eighteenth-century essayist, occupies a five-story limestone town-house on the south side of Sixty-seventh Street between Park and Lexington avenues. Hildebrand had stationed himself within earshot of the reception desk, and when I gave my name to the uniformed attendant he came over and introduced himself. In the first-floor dining room, he rejected the first table we were offered and chose one in the far corner.\n \"San Giorgio on the rocks with a twist,\" he told the waiter. To me he said, \"Do you like San Giorgio? I always have it here because not many restaurants stock it. Do you know it? It\u0027s basically an Italian dry vermouth with some unusual herbs steeped in it. It\u0027s very light. I\u0027m afraid the days of the lunchtime martinis are over for me.\"\n \"I\u0027ll have to try it sometime,\" I said. \"Today, though, I think I\u0027ll have a Perrier.\"\n He apologized in advance for the food. \"It\u0027s a nice room, isn\u0027t it? And of course they don\u0027t hurry you, and with the tables so far apart and half of them empty, well, I thought we might be glad of the privacy. The kitchen\u0027s not too bad if you stay with the basics. I usually have a mixed grill.\"\n \"That sounds good.\"\n \"And a green salad?\"\n \"Fine.\"\n He wrote out the order and handed the card to the waiter. \"Private clubs,\" he said. \"An endangered species. The Addison is presumably a club for authors and journalists, but the membership for years now has run largely to people in advertising and publishing. These days I think they\u0027ll pretty much take you if you\u0027ve got a pulse and a checkbook and no major felony convictions. I joined about fifteen years ago when my wife and I moved up to Stamford, Connecticut. There were a lot of nights when I would work late and miss the last train and have to stay over. Hotels cost a fortune, and I always felt like a shady character checking in without luggage. They have rooms on the top floor here, very reasonable and available at short notice. I\u0027d been thinking about joining anyway, and that gave me an incentive.\"\n \"So you live in Connecticut?\"\n He shook his head. \"We moved back five years ago when our youngest boy finished college. Well, dropped out of it, I should say. We\u0027re living half a dozen blocks from here, and I can walk to work on a day like today. It\u0027s beautiful out, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Well, New York in June. I\u0027ve never been to Paris in April, but I understand it\u0027s apt to be wet and dreary. May\u0027s a lot nicer there, but the song works better with April in it. You need the extra syllable. But New York in June, you can see why they\u0027d write songs about it.\"\n When the waiter brought our food Hildebrand asked me if I\u0027d like a beer with it. I said I was fine. He said, \"I\u0027ll have one of the nonalcoholic beers. I forget which ones you stock. Do you have O\u0027Doul\u0027s?\"\n They did, and he said he\u0027d have one, and looked at me expectantly. I shook my head. The nonalcoholic beers and wines all have at least a trace of alcohol. Whether it\u0027s enough to affect a sober alcoholic is an open question, but the people I\u0027ve known in AA who insisted they could drink Moussy or O\u0027Doul\u0027s or Sharp\u0027s with impunity all wound up picking up something stronger sooner or later.\n Anyway, what the hell would I want with a beer with no kick to it?\n We talked about his work- he was a partner in a small public-relations firm- and about the pleasures of living in the city again after a stretch in the suburbs. If I\u0027d met him at his office we\u0027d have gotten right down to business, but instead we were following the traditional rules of a business lunch, holding the business portion until we\u0027d finished with the food. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-2.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: \n A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) \n In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
