{"id":64054,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\"It\u0027s beginning to sound like a circus.\" \"Well, if you hired me you\u0027d get a much lower profile. I don\u0027t even have a PI license, let alone influence in high places. Any investigation I might mount would have to proceed at a relatively slow pace, and I don\u0027t know how much of a factor time might turn out to be. Have you discussed this with any of your fellow members?\" \"I haven\u0027t said a word to anybody.\" \"Really? That\u0027s a surprise. I would have thought… Oh.\" He gave a long slow nod. \"The club\u0027s not a true secret society, but we\u0027ve certainly kept it a secret from the world. Nobody else knows we exist.\" He took hold of the glass of brandy. \"So if there\u0027s a killer,\" he said evenly, \"it would almost have to be one of us.\" 5 \"God, it\u0027s such a guy thing,\" Elaine said. \"Thirty-one grown men sitting around wooden tables eating meat and checking for chest pains. You can just about smell the testosterone, can\u0027t you?\" \"I\u0027m beginning to understand why they didn\u0027t tell their wives about it.\" \"I\u0027m not putting it down,\" she insisted. \"I\u0027m just pointing out how intrinsically masculine the whole thing is. Keeping it all a secret, only seeing each other once a year, talking solemnly about Important Subjects. Can you imagine the same club composed of women?\" \"It would drive the restaurant crazy,\" I said. \"Thirty-one separate checks.\" \"One check, but we\u0027ll make sure it gets split fairly. \u0027Let\u0027s see, Mary Beth had the apple pie б la mode, so she owes an extra dollar, and Rosalie, you had the Roquefort dressing, which is an additional seventy-five cents.\u0027 Why do they do that, anyway?\" \" Split checks item by item? I\u0027ve often wondered.\" \"No, charge extra for a tablespoon of Roquefort. When you\u0027re paying twenty or thirty dollars for a meal it ought to include whatever salad dressing you want. Why are you looking at me like that?\" \"Because I find you fascinating.\" \"After all these years?\" \"It\u0027s probably abnormal,\" I said, \"but I can\u0027t help it.\" It had been late afternoon by the time I left the Addison Club. I walked home and took a shower, then sat down and went over my notes. She\u0027d called around six to say she wouldn\u0027t be getting home for dinner. \"I\u0027ve got an artist coming at seven to show me his slides,\" she said, \"and I\u0027ve got my class tonight, unless you want me to skip it.\" \"Don\u0027t do that.\" \"There\u0027s some leftover Chinese in the fridge, but you\u0027d probably rather go out. Don\u0027t throw out the leftovers, I\u0027ll have them when I get home.\" \"I\u0027ve got a better idea,\" I said. \"I want to get to a meeting. You go to your class, and meet me afterward at Paris Green.\" \"Deal.\" I went to the 8:30 meeting at St. Paul\u0027s, then walked down Ninth Avenue and got to Paris Green around a quarter after ten. Elaine was on a stool at the bar, chatting with Gary and nursing a tall glass of cranberry juice and seltzer. I went to collect her and he laid a hand on my arm. \"Thank God you\u0027re here,\" he said archly. \"That\u0027s her third one of those, and you know how she gets.\" Bryce gave us a window table, and over dinner she told me about the artist who\u0027d come around earlier, a West Indian black who was the superintendent of a small apartment house in Murray Hill and a self-taught painter. \"He does these village scenes in oil on masonite,\" she said, \"and they have a nice folk-art look to them, but they left me underwhelmed. Maybe I\u0027ve seen too much of that kind of thing. Or maybe he has, because that\u0027s the feeling I got, that his source of inspiration wasn\u0027t his own childhood memories as much as it was the work of other artists he\u0027s been exposed to.\" She made a face. \"But that\u0027s New York, isn\u0027t it? He\u0027s never taken a class or sold a painting, but he knows to bring slides. Who ever heard of a folk artist with slides? I bet you don\u0027t get that crap in Appalachia.\" \"Don\u0027t be so sure.\" \"You\u0027re probably right. Anyway, I told him I\u0027d keep his name on file. In other words, don\u0027t call us. I don\u0027t know, maybe he\u0027s the long-lost bastard son of Grandma Moses and Howard Finster, and I just blew the chance of a lifetime. But I have to go with my instincts, don\u0027t you think?\" They had served her well over the years. When we met I was a cop with a brand-new gold shield in my pocket and a wife and two sons in Syosset, and she was a young call girl, bright and funny and beautiful. We made each other happy for a few years, and then I drank my way out of my marriage and the police department and we pretty much lost track of each other. She went on doing what she\u0027d been doing, saving her money and investing in real estate, keeping fit at the health club, stretching her mind in night school. A couple of years ago circumstances threw us together again, and what we\u0027d had was still there, stronger than ever and richer for the years we\u0027d lived through. At first she went on seeing clients and we both pretended that was okay, but of course it wasn\u0027t, and eventually I bit the bullet and said so and she admitted she\u0027d already put herself out of business. We kept inching closer and closer to marriage. Last April she\u0027d sold her old place on East Fiftieth and picked out an apartment in the Parc Vendфme and we\u0027d moved in together. It was her money that bought the place and I\u0027d refused to let her put my name on the deed. I paid the monthly maintenance on the apartment and picked up the checks when we went out to dinner. She covered the household expenses. Eventually we would put all our money together, but we hadn\u0027t gotten around to that yet. Eventually we would get married, too, and I wasn\u0027t sure why it was taking us so long. We kept not quite setting a date. We kept letting it slide. Meanwhile, she had opened a gallery. First she\u0027d gone to work at one on Madison Avenue with the intention of learning the business. She had an argument with the woman who ran the place and quit after two months, then got a similar job downtown on Spring Street. She didn\u0027t much care for the artwork in either establishment; the photo-realists at the uptown gallery struck her as sterile, while she saw the commercial can-vases at the SoHo gallery as clicheбd and cloying, a high-ticket equivalent of Holiday Inn seascapes and bullfighters. More to the point, she found the business itself unpleasant, the snobbery, the petty jealousies, the relentless courting of investors and corporate collectors. \"I thought I quit prostitution,\" she said one night, \"and here I am pimping for a bunch of bad painters. I don\u0027t get it.\" She went in the following morning and gave notice. What she wanted, she decided, was a sort of cross between a gallery and a curiosity shop. She\u0027d stock it with things she liked, and she\u0027d try to sell them to people who were looking for something to hang on the wall, or place on the coffee table. She had a good eye, everyone told her that, and she\u0027d taken more courses over the years at Hunter and NYU and the New School than your average art historian, so why shouldn\u0027t she take her best shot? It turned out to be easy to get started. There were a lot of vacant storefronts in the neighborhood that season, and she checked them all out and charmed the owner of a building on Ninth and Fifty-fifth into giving her a good lease at a reasonable rent. Over the years she\u0027d packed a locker in an Eleventh Avenue warehouse with things she\u0027d bought and tired of; the two of us went through it and filled the back of a borrowed station wagon with prints and canvases, and that gave her enough stock to open. Toward the end of her first month of operation she paid a second visit to the Matisse show at the Museum of Modern Art and came back wide-eyed. \"It\u0027s an exalting experience,\" she said, \"even more than the first time, and I was completely blown away, but you know what? I realized something. Some of those early paintings, the portraits and still lifes. If you take them entirely out of context, and if you forget that they happened to be painted by a genius, you\u0027d think you were looking at something out of a thrift shop.\" \"I see what you mean,\" I said, \"but isn\u0027t that a little like looking at a Jackson Pollock and saying, \u0027My kid could do this\u0027?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Because I\u0027m not knocking Matisse. I\u0027m putting in a word for the anonymous unheralded amateur.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean context is everything,\" she said. The next day she beeped TJ and hired him to mind the store while she hit every thrift shop she could get to. By the end of the week she had covered most of Manhattan, sorting through hundreds and hundreds of paintings and buying almost thirty, at an average price of $8.75. She lined them up and asked me what I thought. I told her I didn\u0027t think Matisse had anything to worry about. \"I think they\u0027re great,\" she insisted. \"They\u0027re not necessarily good, but they\u0027re great.\" She picked out her six favorites and had them framed in simple gallery-style black frames. She sold two the first week, one for $300 and one for $450. \"See?\" she said, triumphant. \"Stuff \u0027em in a bin at the Salvation Army at ten bucks apiece and they\u0027re thrift-shop art that nobody looks at twice. Treat them with respect and price them at three to five hundred and they\u0027re folk art, and people think they\u0027re a steal. I had a woman in just before closing who fell in love with the desert sunset. \u0027But this looks like paint-by-number,\u0027 she said. \u0027That\u0027s just what it is,\u0027 I told her. \u0027It was the artist\u0027s favorite medium. He worked only with paint-by-number.\u0027 What do you bet she comes back tomorrow and buys it?\" It was getting on for midnight when we left Paris Green and walked home on Ninth Avenue. There was rain forecast but you never would have known it. The air was cool and dry, and there was a breeze off the Hudson. \"Hildebrand gave me a check,\" I told her. \"I\u0027ll deposit it in the morning.\" \"Unless you want to use the ATM.\" \"No, I want to go straight home,\" I said. \"I\u0027m a little tired. And I want to go over my notes some more before I go to sleep.\" \"Do you really think-\" \"- that somebody\u0027s been knocking them off like clay pigeons? I\u0027m not supposed to know yet. I was hired to find out, not to make up my mind in advance.\" \"So you\u0027re keeping an open mind.\" \"Not entirely,\" I admitted. \"It\u0027s hard for me to get away from the numbers. There have been too many deaths. There has to be an explanation. All I have to do is find it.\" We stood at a corner, waiting for the light to change. She said, \"Why would anyone want to do something like that?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"If they were all in college together, and they raped some girl at a drunken fraternity party, and now her brother\u0027s getting revenge.\" \"That\u0027s pretty good,\" I said. \"Or it\u0027s her son, and his mother died in childbirth, so he wants vengeance, but he also has to find out which of the men is his father. How does that sound?\" \"Like a Movie of the Week.\" \"I guess the killer would have to be one of the survivors, huh?\" \"Well, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s one of the victims.\" \"I mean as opposed to-\" \"- somebody from outside,\" I said. \"That\u0027s Hildebrand\u0027s fear, of course. That\u0027s why he\u0027s had to keep his suspicions to himself. He would have liked to voice his concern to a fellow member, but suppose he picked the wrong one to confide in? According to him, nobody on the outside even knows that the club exists.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-6.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
