{"id":64085,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"Then, when he finally struck, he\u0027d allowed himself the extra satisfaction of discovering the body and phoning it in to the police, like a firebug coming back to watch the firemen battle the blaze he\u0027d set. And then, remarkably, he\u0027d stayed on the job another six weeks before he could contrive to get fired.\\n\\n So I knew that he liked to take his time, and I knew, too, that he could strike quickly if he wanted to. I\u0027d seen him on Friday night, and a day later Watson\u0027s widow was dead. A couple of days after that, Gerard Billings was shot to death in the back of a cab.\\n\\n Oh, he was slick. But who the hell was he?\\n\\n I called Ray Gruliow, brought him up to date. \"I feel like a damn fool,\" I said. \"I found the son of a bitch and then I lost him.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t know what you\u0027d found.\"\\n\\n \"No. He knew and I didn\u0027t. He was playing with me, the bastard. He was the cat and I was a particularly dimwitted mouse. You want to know what I did? I took the son of a bitch to AA meetings.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Well, he\u0027d been fired for drinking on the job, and he was leading a shabby life, and he looked for all the world like a drunk getting ready to bottom out. I couldn\u0027t see any reason not to talk about the program, and when I did he did a good job of seeming interested but wary. I have to say he\u0027s a natural when it comes to the principle of anonymity. He\u0027s the most anonymous person I ever met. I still don\u0027t know who the hell he is.\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027ve seen him. You sat across a table and talked to him.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" I said. \"I know what he looks like.\" I described Shorter in detail. \"Now we both know what he looks like,\" I said. \"Does he sound like anybody you know?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not very good at recognizing a man from a description.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s forty-eight years old. He listed his place of birth as Klamath Falls, Oregon, but they never heard of anybody by that name, and there\u0027s no reason to assume he\u0027s ever been within a thousand miles of the place. He moved into his rooming house a week before he turned up on their doorstep at Queensboro-Corona, and it\u0027s my guess that James Shorter was born right about that time. I think he slapped together some fake ID, rented himself a room by the week, and went out to look for a job.\"\\n\\n \"So that he could stalk Alan.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" I said. \"I think he\u0027s a stalker. That\u0027s the only way I can begin to make sense out of what he\u0027s been doing. I did a little research on the subject, and there are elements here that seem to fit the pattern. The way he structured his whole life to support his pursuit of Alan Watson. And the way he postponed the kill. How many chances do you suppose he had in the six months he worked for Q-C? Twenty? A hundred? But he kept putting it off, and not because he was afraid of getting caught.\"\\n\\n \"He was holding back to boost his excitement.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n \"But with Gerry-\"\\n\\n \"I think he started stalking somebody else very shortly after he killed Watson. Probably Billings, but it could have been anybody. Maybe he was keeping tabs on a couple of you. He was still at the same rooming house, still calling himself James Shorter, so I don\u0027t think he was anywhere close to the last act of his little drama. But then I turned up, and he realized it was time for James Shorter to disappear, and he wanted to do something dramatic on the way out.\"\\n\\n \"He picked a pretty dramatic way to kill Gerry.\"\\n\\n \"He would have known where he lived, and his usual schedule. I suppose he had a gun, or knew where to get one. It couldn\u0027t have been too hard for him to take a bus to Newark Airport and drive back in a stolen car. Then all he had to do was wait for Billings and pick his opportunity. Engineering a car crash was a nice touch, but he had other options. He could have staged a drive-by shooting, he could have tried running Billings down.\"\\n\\n Or he could have found a way to toss a bomb through Gruliow\u0027s high-tech plastic window. That way he could have taken out nine of the fourteen remaining members at once. He\u0027d known about the meeting, because I\u0027d been obliging enough to tell him, and when he\u0027d pumped me a little I\u0027d even said it was in the Village. Gruliow was the only member who lived in the Village. Maybe Shorter had been around Commerce Street Tuesday afternoon, maybe he\u0027d been across the street at the Grange, nursing a beer and watching them file in. Watching me, too.\\n\\n I said, \"Who the hell is he? Do you have any idea?\"\\n\\n \"None.\"\\n\\n \"We know he\u0027s not a member, but I don\u0027t think any of us seriously thought it could be. Who else knows about the club?\"\\n\\n \"No one, really. Not in any detail.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s forty-eight. In 1961 he would have been what, sixteen? Could he have been somebody\u0027s younger brother, transferring a resentment against a sibling to the entire club?\"\\n\\n \"God, that strikes me as farfetched.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that we can expect to find a logical motive,\" I said, \"because why should there be a sane explanation for a long-standing pattern of insane behavior? All he needed was a pretext.\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t it have to be a good one to sustain him this long?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"All it had to do was get him started. Once he was in motion his own momentum would sustain him, no matter how frail the original impetus.\"\\n\\n \"Because he enjoys what he\u0027s doing.\"\\n\\n \"He loves it,\" I said, \"but I have a feeling it\u0027s more than that. It\u0027s his whole life.\"\\n\\n I had abbreviated versions of that conversation with as many of the other members as I could get hold of. I described Shorter and asked them if the description seemed to fit anybody who might have picked up a resentment against the group years ago. They all said essentially the same thing- the description fit too many people, and they couldn\u0027t think of anyone, of any description, who had any reason, sane or otherwise, to resent the group. Or even to know it existed.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a shame there\u0027s no photograph,\" more than one of them said. And I explained how his employers in Corona had taken a pair of Polaroids, but nobody could furnish a copy. One was on his ID, which he\u0027d very likely retained; the other had conveniently disappeared from his file.\\n\\n And when, I wondered, had that happened? Had he been resourceful enough to slip off with the photo before they let him go? Or had he paid an unauthorized visit sometime over the weekend to tidy up after himself? He could have combined it with the trip to Forest Hills to drown Helen Watson in her tub.\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t he have had other pictures taken?\" Elaine wondered. \"How did he cash his paychecks? I can\u0027t believe he had a bank account.\"\\n\\n \"He used a check-cashing service. But he had his Queensboro-Corona ID and his driver\u0027s license. He wouldn\u0027t need anything else.\"\\n\\n \"And you sat across a table from him.\"\\n\\n \"And took him to a meeting.\"\\n\\n \"And you don\u0027t get mugged and printed at AA meetings, do you? I guess it would be a violation of the tradition of anonymity, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\\n\\n \"If I\u0027d been along,\" she said, \"I could have taken a sneak photo of him, the way we did at Wallbanger\u0027s. Remember?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake,\" I said.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter? Did I say something wrong?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"You said something right. I don\u0027t know what the hell\u0027s the matter with me, I really don\u0027t. Why can\u0027t I think straight?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n For answer I pointed to a framed drawing on the wall.\\n\\n 26\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you something,\" Ray Galindez said. \"This is a piece of cake. You got a nice clear picture of the guy in your mind and how long did it take to get it out of your head and onto a piece of paper? Fifteen, twenty minutes?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n \"Compared to witnesses who don\u0027t know how to use their eyes and can\u0027t remember what they saw with them, this is a cinch. I had one a week ago, over and over she\u0027s telling me I got the eyes wrong. How are they wrong? Too big, too small, too far apart, too close together, what? Are they slanted? Are they almond-shaped? Droopy eyelids? Tell me something, because just saying they\u0027re wrong don\u0027t cut it. I try this, I try that, I change this, I fix that, all I get is the eyes are wrong. You know what it turns out?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"She never saw his fuckin\u0027 eyes. The guy was wearing mirrored sunglasses. It takes her the better part of an hour to remember this, and this is a guy who stood right smack in fucking front of her and held her up at gunpoint. \u0027The eyes are wrong,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll never forget those eyes.\u0027 Except she never saw \u0027em, so what\u0027s she gonna forget?\"\\n\\n \"At least she had the sense to sit down with you,\" I said. \"I couldn\u0027t get past the fact that I didn\u0027t have a photograph of him. I was sitting in the same room with one of your sketches and I still didn\u0027t get the message.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes it\u0027s hard to see what\u0027s right in front of you.\"\\n\\n \"I guess.\"\\n\\n When I went to pay him he didn\u0027t want to take the money. \"I figure I owe you,\" he said, \"everything Elaine\u0027s done for me. I took my mother to see the gallery and now every word out of her mouth is mi hijo el artista. She wasn\u0027t this impressed when I got on the job. Speaking of which, it\u0027s not the same.\"\\n\\n \"The Department?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, who\u0027s to say, but I\u0027m just talking about my own detail. They want me to use a computer to do what I do.\"\\n\\n \"You mean like an Identi-Kit?\"\\n\\n \"No, this is different,\" he said. \"Much more flexible than the Identi-Kit. You can make minute adjustments to the shape of the mouth, elongate the head, set the eyes deeper, anything you could do with pencil and paper.\" He explained how the software worked and what it would do. \"But it\u0027s not drawing,\" he said. \"It\u0027s not art.\"\\n\\n He laughed, and I asked him what was funny.\\n\\n \"Just hearing myself use the word,\" he said. \"I would always correct Elaine when she called it art, what I do. I\u0027m beginning to think she\u0027s right. I\u0027ll tell you one thing, what I been doing with that European woman is different from anything I ever done before. You know about her? Customer of Elaine\u0027s, she lost all her family in the Holocaust?\"\\n\\n \"Elaine told me. I didn\u0027t know you\u0027d started working with her.\"\\n\\n \"Two sessions so far, and it\u0027s the most exhausting thing I ever did in my life. She doesn\u0027t remember what any of the people look like.\"\\n\\n \"Then how can you possibly draw them?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, the memory\u0027s in there. It\u0027s a question of reaching in and dragging it out. We started with her father. What did he look like? Well, that doesn\u0027t get us anywhere, because she hasn\u0027t got an answer. The best she can do is he\u0027s tall. Okay, what kind of man is he? He\u0027s very gentle, she says. Okay, so I start drawing. He\u0027s got a deep voice, she remembers. I draw some more. Sometimes he would lose his temper. Okay, now I\u0027m drawing a tall gentle man with a deep voice who gets angry. Late at night he would sit at the kitchen table adding columns of numbers. Okay, great, let\u0027s draw that. And we keep on, and now and then we have to stop because she\u0027s crying, or she can\u0027t look at the paper anymore, or she\u0027s just wiped out. Believe me, time we\u0027re done, we\u0027re both wiped out.\"\\n\\n \"And you wound up with a human face?\"\\n\\n \"I wound up with a human face,\" he said, \"but whose face? Does it look like the man who went to the gas chamber? No way to know. It brought back memories, I know that much, and she\u0027s got a picture that means something to her, so what\u0027s the difference? Is it as good as a photograph? Well, maybe it\u0027s better. Is it art?\" He shrugged. \"I have to say I think so.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-37.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) \\n In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
