It\u0027s part of your annual litany.\"\\n\\n \"Part of our-\"\\n\\n \"For years now,\" I said, \"you all thought he was dead.\"\\n\\n \"My God,\" he said. \"It\u0027s him, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"You tell me, Ray.\"\\n\\n \"It is,\" he said. \"It\u0027s Severance.\"\\n\\n \"I made a couple of stops on my way here,\" I told him. \"I went over to Lew Hildebrand\u0027s apartment and caught him before he left for work. I saw Avery Davis at his office. They were both able to identify the sketch as James Severance. In fact Davis said he had already been struck by the killer\u0027s resemblance to Severance, and would have mentioned something except that he knew Severance was dead. Everybody knew it, and how could you possibly forget it? You\u0027ve been reading his name all those years.\"\\n\\n \"And he\u0027s not dead?\"\\n\\n \"I went down to Washington yesterday,\" I said. \"I went to see if his name was engraved on the Memorial down there.\"\\n\\n \"And it wasn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure if that proves anything, Matt. Their accuracy\u0027s a long way from a hundred percent. People have been left off the Memorial, and guys who survived the war have found their names carved in stone. He could be carried on the books as MIA, he could have been overlooked in any number of ways-\"\\n\\n \"He never served,\" I said.\\n\\n \"He was never in Vietnam?\"\\n\\n \"He was never in the service, period. I went to the Veterans Administration and I found somebody who knew somebody at the Pentagon. They did a pretty comprehensive check of the service records. He was never in any branch of the service. I don\u0027t know if he was ever called up, or if he even bothered to register for the draft. That would be harder to check, and I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s any point to it. What\u0027s relevant is he didn\u0027t die in Vietnam, and he doesn\u0027t seem to have died anywhere else, either. Because he\u0027s still alive.\"\\n\\n \"It seems impossible.\"\\n\\n \"Avery Davis said it\u0027s like finding out at age thirty that you were adopted.\"\\n\\n \"I know what he meant. I barely knew Severance. He never said much. I saw him once a year for a couple of years, and then he missed a dinner because he was in the army, and then the following year or the year after Homer read his name. And I\u0027ve heard it read once a year ever since.\"\\n\\n \"How did he get chosen for the club?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Either he was somebody\u0027s friend or Homer found him all by himself. Did Lew or Avery-\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"They met him for the first time at Cunningham\u0027s. And they didn\u0027t know how he got there. I wonder how he faked his death. How did you learn of it?\"\\n\\n \"Let me think.\" He took a sip of his hard-way coffee. \"God, it was a long time ago. I seem to remember Homer reading a letter from him, explaining that his heart was with us even though his body was wearing a uniform. And he hoped to be with us soon, and if anything happened to him he\u0027d made arrangements for us to be notified.\"\\n\\n \"He was setting you up.\"\\n\\n \"I guess so. It must have been a year later that Homer read his name along with Phil Kalish\u0027s and explained that he\u0027d received a telegram a couple of months before.\"\\n\\n \"From whom?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think he said. I suppose I assumed it was either from the army or from a relative of Severance\u0027s. Obviously it wasn\u0027t from either, no matter how it may have been signed. Severance sent it himself.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Was he already planning to kill us?\"\\n\\n \"Hard to say.\"\\n\\n \"And why, for God\u0027s sake? What did we ever do to him?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"You know, I met him a few times. I sat across a table from him.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027ve said.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027ve met the surviving members, most of them, anyway. And it\u0027s hard to imagine him sitting down to dinner with the rest of you. I\u0027ll grant you that you\u0027ve all worked hard and created successful lives for yourselves while he\u0027s been living in cheap hotels and eating in diners and holding subsistence jobs when he\u0027s worked at all. The different paths you\u0027ve taken for the past thirty years would account for some of the difference, but I think he must have been different to start with.\"\\n\\n \"Well, hell,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t like to say it when I regarded him as one of our honored dead, but I can say it now, can\u0027t I? He came across as a loser.\"\\n\\n \"A loser.\"\\n\\n \"A nobody, a nebbish. A guy who wasn\u0027t going to make the cut. You\u0027re right, he wasn\u0027t in our league. He didn\u0027t belong at the same table with the rest of us.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe he realized that himself,\" I said. \"Maybe it pissed him off.\"\\n\\n He wanted to speculate on Severance\u0027s motives, and what might have gone through his mind. Earlier, he said, before he had any idea who the killer was or what might be motivating him, it had struck him that the whole affair was a sort of collective form of erotomania, where a disturbed individual becomes fixated on someone, often a celebrity. \"Like that woman who kept breaking into David Letterman\u0027s house,\" he said. \"Or the lunatic who killed John Lennon.\"\\n\\n \"Afterward,\" I said, \"there will be plenty of time to figure out what makes him tick.\"\\n\\n \"Afterward?\"\\n\\n \"After he\u0027s locked up,\" I said. \"And I think it\u0027s time to make sure that happens as soon as possible. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve gone about as far as I can go with this, Ray. I\u0027m ready to turn it over to the professionals.\"\\n\\n \"I never thought of you as an amateur.\"\\n\\n \"I am when it comes to mounting an all-out manhunt. That\u0027s the way to catch him fast. Between the cops and the tabloids and America\u0027s Most Wanted, there\u0027s no way he\u0027ll be able to stay hidden.\"\\n\\n He looked at me. \"And what about us?\"\\n\\n \"The club\u0027s story will come out,\" I said. \"If that\u0027s what you mean. But there\u0027s no way to avoid that.\"\\n\\n \"No?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see how.\"\\n\\n He cupped his chin in his hand. \"Let\u0027s assume he\u0027s in New York,\" he said. \"Do you think you could find him?\"\\n\\n \"Without the police?\"\\n\\n \"Without the police or the press.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have their resources.\"\\n\\n \"No, but you have other resources at your disposal. We could give you a substantial operating budget. And you could offer a reward.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not impossible,\" I said. \"But you\u0027d just be postponing the inevitable. The story would have to come out when he went to trial, and it would be every bit as sensational and get just as much of a play.\"\\n\\n \"When he went to trial.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"And what do you suppose would happen at that trial? And afterward?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure I follow you.\"\\n\\n \"What would happen? What would be the outcome of the trial?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose he\u0027d get convicted of murder,\" I said. \"Unless he had Hard-Way Ray for a lawyer.\"\\n\\n He laughed. \"No, I\u0027m afraid he\u0027d have to get along without my services. But are you all that certain he\u0027d be found guilty? Which killing do you suppose he\u0027d stand trial for?\"\\n\\n \"Billings is the most recent one.\"\\n\\n \"And what\u0027s the evidence? Can you put him on the scene? Can you tie him to the car? Can you produce a murder weapon, let alone prove it was in his hand?\"\\n\\n \"Once the police go to work on it-\"\\n\\n \"They might have an eyewitness or two who can pick him out of a lineup,\" he said, \"but I wouldn\u0027t count on it, and I don\u0027t have to tell you how little most eyewitness testimony is worth in a courtroom. Who else has he killed? Watson\u0027s widow? Watson himself? Can you prove any of that? We know he was on the scene, he discovered Alan\u0027s body, but where\u0027s your evidence?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your point?\"\\n\\n \"My point is that a conviction is by no means a foregone conclusion. You can throw out the early cases entirely. He killed Boyd and Diana Shipton, he went down to Atlanta and shot Ned Bayliss, he hanged Hal Gabriel with his belt, God knows what else he did, and you can forget all of that because there\u0027s not going to be any way to prove it. And I seriously doubt you can convince a jury he killed anybody else, either.\"\\n\\n I recalled something Joe Durkin had said. \"It\u0027s a wonder anybody ever goes to jail for anything,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" he said. \"I think the system is generally pretty good at locking people up. Too good, sometimes. But that doesn\u0027t mean you can make a tight enough case against Severance to put him away. Hell, if you had the goods on him, he could probably plead insanity and make it stand up. He\u0027s devoted his life to a career of senseless systematic serial murder. You want to try to sell him to a jury as a model of mental health?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t even buy that myself.\"\\n\\n \"Neither can I. I figure the bastard\u0027s nuts. I also figure he\u0027s done enough harm for one lifetime.\"\\n\\n I had an idea where this was going. I didn\u0027t much want to go there. I got the waiter\u0027s attention and had him refill my coffee cup.\\n\\n Gruliow said, \"Say I\u0027m wrong. He stands trial, they find him guilty on all counts, and he goes to prison.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds good to me.\"\\n\\n \"Does it? Obviously, it makes the club and all of its members the focus of a lot of unwelcomed publicity, but there\u0027s no avoiding that, is there? Maybe we\u0027d survive as an institution. For my own part, I can\u0027t imagine ceasing to get together every May. But I hate to think how all that media attention would change things.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s unfortunate, but-\"\\n\\n \"But we\u0027re talking life and death here, and our desire to stay out of the spotlight is comparatively inconsequential. I can\u0027t argue with that. But let\u0027s take this a little further. What happens to Severance?\"\\n\\n \"He stays in some maximum-security joint upstate for the rest of his life.\"\\n\\n \"Think so?\"\\n\\n \"I thought we were supposing he\u0027d be found guilty. I don\u0027t think the court\u0027s going to slap his wrist and let him off with time served and five years\u0027 probation.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s assume he gets a life sentence. How much time would he serve?\"\\n\\n \"That depends.\"\\n\\n \"Seven years?\"\\n\\n \"It could be a lot more than that.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you think he could behave himself in prison? Don\u0027t you think he could convince the parole board that he\u0027s a changed man? Matt, the man\u0027s the most patient son of a bitch on God\u0027s earth. He\u0027s spent thirty years killing us and he\u0027s only a little more than halfway through. You think he won\u0027t be content to bide his time? They\u0027ll have him stamping out license plates and it\u0027ll just be another menial job, like working as a rent-a-cop in Queens. They\u0027ll stick him in a cell and it\u0027ll just be another in a long string of furnished rooms. What does he care how long he has to sit on his ass? He\u0027s been sitting on his ass for thirty years. Sooner or later they\u0027ll have to let him out, and do you think for one moment that he\u0027ll be magically rehabilitated?\"\\n\\n I looked at him.\\n\\n \"Well? Do you?\"\\n\\n \"No, of course not.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll start in where he left off. By the time he gets out, Mother Nature will have done some of his work for him. There\u0027ll have been some thinning of the ranks. But some of us will be left, and what do you bet he comes after us? What do you bet he tries to pick us off one by one?\"\\n\\n I opened my mouth, then closed it without saying anything. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-41.html","bookId":2330,"book":{"id":2330,"title":"A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12)","description":"Storyline: A Long Line of Dead Men (Matthew Scudder #12) \\n In Manhattan, thirty men have been meeting once a year for years; they form a tontine, a secret, private club, the only purpose of which is to record the passage of time and to give a toast to the joys of life.
