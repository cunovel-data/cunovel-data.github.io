{"id":80535,"no":58,"title":"Page 58","content":"“Emilia,” I fill the pause, because everyone is still trying to figure out what to call me. Except maybe Josh, who’s always known.\n “Emilia,” she says, and hugs me. “You have a beautiful voice.”\n And maybe some things aren’t the same.\n “Answer me something,” Josh says, a month after I’ve gotten back. I’m in the chair in his garage and I’m doing homework, not woodworking, because I may never catch up. I could go inside and study in the air conditioning, but I love this place. And being out here, breathing sawdust in Josh Bennett’s garage with him, is worth any amount of sweat.\n “I’ve answered everything, Josh. I don’t think there are any questions left to ask.”\n “Just one,” he says, laying down a screwdriver and coming over to lean against the workbench opposite me. He pushes his boots out far enough so that they just touch mine.\n I close the book and try not to smile at him, because I know what’s coming. It’s the question I’ve been waiting for him to ask since the day I got lost and ended up at his house in the middle of the night, before he even knew what the question was.\n “What did you see when you died?” He has that tentative half smile, like he’s almost embarrassed by what he’s saying. “Because I’m guessing it wasn’t the Sea of Tranquility.”\n And when I look at him, I’m not so sure it wasn’t.\n “Where did you go?” His voice drops just slightly and he loses even the suggestion of a smile.\n He’s watching me like he’s not sure he’s allowed to ask the question, and he’s not even sure he wants the answer. I can almost see his grandfather’s words and Josh’s doubts about them swimming in his head. On every side of me are the lights and the tools and the wood and the boots and the boy I want to see forever. And if my Sea of Tranquility were real, it would be this place, here, with him.\n I don’t say anything right away, because I just want one minute to look at his face before I give him my last secret.\n And then I tell him.\n “Your garage.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sea-of-tranquility/page-58.html","bookId":1857,"book":{"id":1857,"title":"The Sea of Tranquility","description":"Storyline: \n I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you. A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck. I am pressed so hard against the earth by the weight of reality that some days I wonder how I am still able to lift my feet to walk. \n Former piano prodigy Nastya Kashnikov wants two things: to get through high school without anyone learning about her past and to make the boy who took everything from her—her identity, her spirit, her will to live—pay. \n Josh Bennett’s story is no secret: every person he loves has been taken from his life until, at seventeen years old, there is no one left. Now all he wants is be left alone and people allow it because when your name is synonymous with death, everyone tends to give you your space. \n Everyone except Nastya, the mysterious new girl at school who starts showing up and won’t go away until she’s insinuated herself into every aspect of his life. But the more he gets to know her, the more of an enigma she becomes. As their relationship intensifies and the unanswered questions begin to pile up, he starts to wonder if he will ever learn the secrets she’s been hiding—or if he even wants to. \n The Sea of Tranquility is a rich, intense, and brilliantly imagined story about a lonely boy, an emotionally fragile girl, and the miracle of second chances.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sea-of-tranquility.jpg","author":"Katja Millay","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-sea-of-tranquility.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:26:06 PM"}}
