{"id":8426,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. CATCHING A THIEF.","content":"\"WHAT are you doing here?\" demanded Robert, in a quick, imperious tone. The man, like all who are engaged in a disreputable deed, started suddenly and half rose from his crouching position, still holding the keys in his hand. He did not answer immediately, probably because it was rather difficult to decide what to say. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded Robert, once more. \"None of your business!\" answered the man, whose temper got the better of his prudence. \"I should think it was my business, as you were trying to get at my property.\" \"That\u0027s a lie!\" said the man, sullenly. As he spoke he stepped out of the wagon, and Robert recognized him as the canvas man, Carden, introduced in the last chapter. 111 \"It\u0027s the truth,\" said Robert firmly. \"I know you, Carden, and I am not much surprised. It won\u0027t do to try it again.\" \"I\u0027ve a great mind to thrash you for your impudence!\" growled Carden. \"I can defend myself,\" returned Robert, coolly, who had plenty of courage. Carden laughed derisively. \"What can you do?\" he said. \"You\u0027d be like a baby in my grasp.\" \"I am not afraid of you,\" said Robert, with composure. \"Don\u0027t come around here again.\" \"I shall go where I please,\" said Carden, with the addition of an oath. \"And don\u0027t you go to telling tales of me, or I\u0027ll wring your neck.\" Robert did not answer, but when Carden had slunk away, opened the locker himself, and took out a wallet filled with bills. \"It is imprudent to leave so much money here,\" he reflected. \"If I hadn\u0027t come up just as I did, Carden would have got hold of it. What shall I do with it?\" Robert felt that it would not do to carry it round with him, as that would be about as imprudent as to leave it in the locker. He decided112 after a little reflection upon leaving it with the manager of the circus, in whom he had every confidence, and deservedly. He accordingly sought Mr. Coleman after the entertainment was over. \"Well, Robert, what is it?\" asked the manager, kindly. \"I have a favor to ask of you, sir.\" \"Very well; what is it?\" \"I came near losing all my savings to-night. Will you take charge of this wallet for me? I don\u0027t feel safe with it in my possession.\" \"Certainly, Robert. How much money have you here?\" \"Two hundred dollars.\" \"Whew! You are rich. You say you came near losing it?\" \"Yes, to-night.\" \"How was that?\" Robert detailed his visit to his locker, and his discovery of the canvas man attempting to open it, but he mentioned no names. \"Which of the canvas men was it?\" asked Mr. Coleman. Robert hesitated. 113 \"I don\u0027t want to get the man into trouble,\" he said. \"That does you credit, but if we have a thief with us it is important that we should know it, for there are others whom he may try to rob.\" From what he knew of Carden, Robert felt that the apprehension was very well founded, and he saw that it was his duty to mention the name of the thief. \"It was Carden,\" he answered. \"The very man I suspected,\" said the manager. \"The other men are rough, but he looks like a scoundrel. He came to me and begged for work, and I engaged him, though I knew nothing about him. I shall see him in the morning, and discharge him.\" The manager did not forget. The next morning he summoned Carden, and said, quietly, \"Carden, you are no longer in my employ. I will pay you to the end of the week, but I want you to leave now.\" \"What\u0027s that for?\" growled the canvas man, looking ugly. \"It\u0027s on account of what happened last night,\" said the manager. 114 \"Has that young fool been blabbing about me?\" \"I have said nothing about any one.\" \"No, but I know Robert Rudd\u0027s been telling tales about me.\" \"He answered my questions, but said he didn\u0027t want to get you into trouble.\" \"Of course not!\" sneered Carden. \"He\u0027s a nice boy, he is; the young liar.\" \"You seem to know what he said,\" observed the manager, eying the man keenly. \"I s\u0027pose he said I was tryin\u0027 to rob him.\" \"He did, and I believed him.\" \"Then he lied!\" said the man, fiercely. \"He\u0027ll repent the day he told tales about me.\" \"That will do, Carden,\" said the manager, quietly. \"Here\u0027s your money.\" Carden went off swearing. As he was leaving the grounds of the circus he met Robert. \"You\u0027ve been blabbing about me. I\u0027ll fix you,\" he said. Robert made no reply, for he did not care to get into a dispute with such a man.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83301.html","bookId":277,"book":{"id":277,"title":"The Young Circus Rider or, the Mystery of Robert Rudd","description":"简介： ABOUT three o\u0027clock in the afternoon an oddly assorted couple walked through the main street in the manufacturing town of Crampton.
