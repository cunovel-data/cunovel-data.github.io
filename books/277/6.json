{"id":8418,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V. TARBOX AND THE CONSTABLE GO TO THE CIRCUS.","content":"\"ITHINK I\u0027ll go in and bid my wife good-by,\" said the constable, ruefully. \"What\u0027s the need of that?\" asked Tarbox, impatiently. \"We don\u0027t know what may happen,\" said Spriggins, solemnly. \"I\u0027m ready to do my duty by the gover\u0027ment; but it\u0027s a risky business, arrestin\u0027 a giant.\" \"Oh, well, be quick about it. I don\u0027t believe Mrs. Spriggins will mind.\" This remark did not seem to encourage or soothe the constable, but he made no remark. He went into the house, and Mrs. Spriggins followed him when he came out. \"Nathan Tarbox,\" she said, \"you\u0027re real mean to get my husband into trouble.\" \"How have I got him into trouble,\" demanded Tarbox doggedly. 42 \"You want to get him into a fight with a giant. He ain\u0027t fit to wrestle with any one, bein\u0027 in poor health, least of all a giant.\" \"Ain\u0027t he a officer of the law? That\u0027s what I want to know,\" said Tarbox. \"Why, yes.\" \"Then let him do his duty. I\u0027ve put a warrant into his hands, and Squire Price and I expect him to execute it.\" \"Suppose he\u0027s killed?\" suggested Mrs. Spriggins. Her husband looked nervous at the possibility hinted at, but Tarbox was inexorable. \"Then you can be proud of his dyin\u0027 while doin\u0027 his duty. Come, constable, I\u0027ve no time to waste. Come along!\" \"You\u0027re real mean!\" ejaculated Mrs. Spriggins, tearfully. Tarbox deigned no answer, but strode out of the yard, followed by the reluctant constable. Few words were said, but when they were half way to the circus grounds a bright idea struck Spriggins. \"I say, Mr. Tarbox,\" he said, eagerly, \"can\u0027t we compromise this thing?\" 43 \"I don\u0027t know what you mean.\" \"You might authorize me to say to the giant in a friendly kind of way that your feelin\u0027s are hurt, that it\u0027s probably all a misunderstandin\u0027, and propose to make up.\" \"Spriggins, are you a fool? Do you think I\u0027m goin\u0027 to compromise after I\u0027ve been shaken almost to pieces and my dog has been kicked to death?\" \"He might agree to buy you a new dog, if it was properly set before him.\" \"A new dog wouldn\u0027t make up for Bruiser. He scared all the children in the neighborhood. I shan\u0027t see his like again. What I want is—revenge!\" \"Why don\u0027t you lay for him then yourself, and not drag me into it?\" \"Spriggins, I believe you\u0027re a coward—you\u0027re afraid of this Enoch.\" \"Who wouldn\u0027t be afraid of a man eight or nine feet high?\" \"I ain\u0027t afraid of him,\" said Tarbox, stoutly. \"I\u0027ll stand by you; we\u0027ll face him together.\" Seeing that there was no disposition to yield on the part of his client, if I may so designate Mr.44 Tarbox, the constable continued on his way, grasping the warrant in uneasy fingers. It was some distance to the circus grounds, but the way seemed all too short for Constable Spriggins, who felt like a man approaching an enemy\u0027s battery. At length they came in sight of the circus grounds. Around the big tent were congregated a crowd of men and boys, and a stream of people was already marching up to the box office to buy tickets, while hitched to trees and posts were carriages and wagons of all descriptions which had been employed to convey intending spectators from the town round about. Nothing draws like a circus in the country, or perhaps we may add in the city also. \"There\u0027s goin\u0027 to be a crowd,\" remarked the constable. \"Yes; fools and their money are soon parted. I never went to a circus in all my life. It\u0027s all foolery.\" \"I went once when I was a boy, and I liked it. I little thought under what circumstances I should make my second visit,\" said Spriggins, ruefully. 45 \"Circuses are wicked, in my opinion,\" said Tarbox. \"I\u0027d close \u0027em all up if I could; we\u0027ll do what we can to stop this.\" By this time they had got into the crowd at the entrance. Instead of going up to the ticket office to purchase tickets they passed on, and reached the doorway where stood a man to receive tickets. \"Where\u0027s your tickets?\" demanded he of Spriggins and his companion. Mr. Spriggins turned to Tarbox expecting him to explain. \"We don\u0027t need no tickets,\" said he in an impressive manner. \"This man is an officer of the law.\" \"No deadheads—no free list,\" said the ticket-taker shortly. \"Stand aside!\" \"You don\u0027t understand me,\" said Tarbox. \"This is Constable Spriggins, and he demands admission in the name of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\" \"The United States don\u0027t own this show, nor yet the State of Massachusetts. Stand aside and let those who have tickets enter.\" 46 \"It\u0027s no use,\" said the constable, rather relieved. \"They won\u0027t let us in.\" \"This officer wants to make an arrest in your building,\" said Tarbox, trying again. \"Can\u0027t help it! He can\u0027t get in without a ticket.\" \"You see how \u0027tis,\" said Spriggins, cheerfully. \"We can\u0027t get in.\" \"Force your way in!\" said Tarbox, indignantly. \"You\u0027ve got the law on your side.\" This the constable positively refused to do. \"Then buy a ticket and go in. The State will pay you back.\" \"I\u0027ve no call to do it, and I don\u0027t believe I\u0027d get my money back.\" \"You refuse to do your duty, do you?\" \"No I don\u0027t. I\u0027ve tried, and I can\u0027t. You know how it is yourself.\" Mr. Tarbox was nonplussed. He didn\u0027t like to give up his cherished scheme of vengeance, yet how was he to carry it out? \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do,\" he said; \"I\u0027ll buy you a ticket, and trust to the State to pay me.\" \"You can\u0027t collect it of me,\" said the constable,47 \"even if the State don\u0027t pay you. You can buy me a ticket if you want to.\" But Tarbox was seized with a sudden suspicion. Spriggins might go in and see the show at his expense, and leave his duty unperformed. There was nothing to do but to go in with him, and that would involve the purchase of two tickets, and the expenditure of an entire dollar, which Tarbox, who was a close man, could not think of without mentally groaning. Nevertheless, his soul thirsted for revenge, and it was clear that revenge could not be had without expense. \"Spriggins,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll buy two tickets, and we\u0027ll go in together.\" The constable would have preferred to go in alone. He wanted to see the show, and if he had been unaccompanied he could have done so without any troublesome duties disturbing his enjoyment. \"Jest as you say,\" he answered, a little nervously. Mr. Tarbox joined the line, and gradually worked his way to the ticket office. \"A couple of tickets,\" he said, handing a dollar bill to the ticket agent. 48 Two tickets were immediately passed to him, and he and the constable entered the tent. Opposed as he was to the circus, Tarbox could not forbear looking about him with considerable curiosity. They were not yet in the main room, but were in an outer lobby where were ranged the cages of animals. Mr. Tarbox started as an African lion, whose cage he was passing, roared, and he regarded with some apprehension the gratings of the cage. \"It\u0027s rather resky,\" he said. \"Suppose the lions or tigers should break out.\" The constable trembled at the suggestion, but still seemed interested in looking about him. \"Come, Mr. Tarbox,\" he said, \"let\u0027s go and look at the elephants.\" \"Do you think I came here to see elephants?\" he said, sternly. \"Constable, I call upon you to do your duty.\" \"How can I?\" asked the constable; \"I don\u0027t see the giant.\" One of the canvas men happened to be passing, and Mr. Tarbox, rightly concluding that he was connected with the show, asked, \"Where\u0027s Enoch?\" 49 \"Enoch!\" repeated the canvas man, staring; \"I guess you\u0027re off. I don\u0027t know any Enoch.\" \"I mean the Norwegian giant.\" \"Oh!\" said the attendant, smiling. \"You just follow round to the left, and you\u0027ll see him. He\u0027s sittin\u0027 next to the fat lady.\" \"Constable,\" said Mr. Tarbox, grasping his companion by the arm, \"we are on the scent. Come along, and we\u0027ll see what the villain has to say to the law.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83293.html","bookId":277,"book":{"id":277,"title":"The Young Circus Rider or, the Mystery of Robert Rudd","description":"简介： ABOUT three o\u0027clock in the afternoon an oddly assorted couple walked through the main street in the manufacturing town of Crampton.
