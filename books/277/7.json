{"id":8419,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. TARBOX IS DEFEATED.","content":"THE performance had not commenced—indeed, half an hour would elapse before the hour fixed—and several of the performers were to be seen among the spectators about the cages of the animals. One of these Tarbox recognized. \"Look at that boy!\" he said, clutching the constable\u0027s arm. He pointed to Robert Rudd and Charlie Davis, the two young riders, who were walking together. \"What of him?\" asked Spriggins. \"That\u0027s the young villain that was with Enoch.\" Spriggins inwardly wished that the warrant was for Robert instead of the giant. \"Why didn\u0027t you arrest him instead of the giant?\" he asked. \"Perhaps I will yet, for he trespassed on my grounds; but it was Enoch that shook me up and51 killed Bruiser. Look here, young feller,\" he said, addressing Robert. Robert turned and smiled as he recognized the farmer. \"Oh, it\u0027s you,\" he answered. \"Yes, it\u0027s me,\" answered Tarbox sternly. \"Where is Enoch?\" \"Who do you mean?\" \"That overgrown brute that was with you this afternoon.\" Charlie Davis asked a question in a low voice of Robert, and then turning to Tarbox before Robert had a chance to answer him asked: \"Do you want to buy a dog, mister?\" \"You\u0027re too small! I don\u0027t want a puppy!\" answered Tarbox, scowling. \"Oh, you\u0027re too fresh!\" answered Charlie, rather annoyed, particularly as Robert laughed. \"Why don\u0027t you answer me, boy?\" demanded Tarbox angrily. \"I will conduct you to my friend, the Norwegian giant,\" answered Robert politely. \"Come along, Spriggins!\" said Mr. Tarbox, pulling after him the reluctant constable. Spriggins would have enjoyed a leisurely examination52 of the Albino sisters, the wild man from Borneo, the living skeleton, and the fat lady, but none of them had attractions for Mr. Tarbox, whose soul was fired by the desire for revenge. All too soon they reached the chair where in massive dignity sat Anak, the Norwegian giant. As Anak\u0027s eyes rested on the approaching visitors, he looked amused. \"I\u0027m glad to see you, my friend,\" he called out, in the deep tones natural to him, to Tarbox. \"And I\u0027m glad to see you,\" said Tarbox, spitefully. \"I came here expressly to see you.\" \"You\u0027re very kind,\" said Anak. \"Take a good look. There ain\u0027t so much of me as there is of my friend, Mme. Leonora,\" with a wave of the hand towards the fat lady; \"but you can look at me as much as you want to.\" \"I shall soon see you in a prison cell,\" said Mr. Tarbox, sternly. \"Constable Spriggins, do your duty, sir.\" Poor Spriggins gazed at the immense man before him, with his heart gradually sinking down into his boots. Never in all his life had he been placed in such an embarrassing position. What utter nonsense it was for him to think of leading53 out such a monster by the collar. Why, he couldn\u0027t begin to reach up to Anak\u0027s collar. \"Can\u0027t we compromise this thing?\" he asked, faintly. \"No, we can\u0027t, Spriggins; I insist upon your doin\u0027 your duty.\" \"What do you want?\" asked Anak, in some curiosity. \"Produce your warrant, Spriggins,\" said Tarbox. The constable mechanically drew it out from his inside pocket. Tarbox saw that he must take the initiative, and he was perfectly willing to do so. \"Enoch,\" he said, \"this man is an officer of the law. He has a warrant for your arrest.\" \"For my arrest?\" inquired Anak, opening his eyes in amazed surprise. \"Yes, for assault and battery on me, Nathan Tarbox, and the murder of my dog, Bruiser. Such things can be done in Norway, p\u0027r\u0027aps, but they ain\u0027t allowed in the State of Massachusetts. Spriggins, do your duty.\" The constable looked at the giant uncomfortably, and edged away a little. 54 \"What!\" said Anak, shaking his sides, \"does he want to arrest me?\" \"Yes,\" said Tarbox, grimly. \"Spriggins, read the warrant.\" \"Read it yourself, Mr. Tarbox.\" Tarbox did so with evident enjoyment, but Anak\u0027s enjoyment seemed no less. \"Ho, ho, ho!\" he shouted. \"This is a joke!\" \"You won\u0027t find it much of a joke,\" said Tarbox. \"Come, Spriggins, do your duty.\" \"Mr. Enoch,\" said the constable, in a trembling voice, \"if you\u0027ll come with me without making any fuss, I\u0027ll see that you are well treated.\" \"Suppose I don\u0027t?\" said Anak. Spriggins looked helplessly at Tarbox. That was a question he could not answer. \"Then it\u0027ll be the worse for you,\" said Tarbox, who was always ready to make up for his companion\u0027s deficiencies. \"Can\u0027t you wait till the performance is over?\" asked the giant, smiling. \"To be sure,\" said Spriggins, quickly. \"Anything to oblige.\" \"No,\" said Tarbox, decidedly. \"The warrant must be served now. You have no discretion.\" 55 \"I\u0027d like to oblige the gentleman,\" said the constable, who wanted to avoid trouble and see the performance. \"You can\u0027t. It won\u0027t be allowed.\" \"What\u0027s the use of losing the benefit of our money, Mr. Tarbox?\" \"That\u0027s my affair. I don\u0027t want to see the circus. I consider it a wicked snare to lure souls to Satan.\" \"But I don\u0027t; you can go, you know,\" suggested Spriggins. \"No; I shall stay here to see that you do your duty.\" \"You have no charge over me,\" said the constable, with some spirit. \"All the same you need looking after. Enoch, if you defy the law you\u0027ll find it the worse for you. This ain\u0027t Norway.\" \"No; we\u0027ve got no such fools as you in Norway,\" retorted the giant. \"Tell me what you want.\" Tarbox whispered to Spriggins. The latter in a tremulous voice said, \"Enoch, I arrest you in the name of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and I require you to come with me at once.\" 56 \"Come and take me,\" said Anak, his broad face relaxing with a smile. \"What do you mean?\" asked Tarbox, quickly. \"I mean that I shan\u0027t stir from this chair. My contract with this show requires me to sit here. If the constable wants me, he must take me by force. He needn\u0027t be afraid. If he can take me he may.\" Even Tarbox looked rather nonplussed. Both he and Spriggins together would have found it impossible to carry off a giant weighing over four hundred pounds. \"You see, we\u0027ll have to give it up,\" said Spriggins, with evident pleasure. \"You\u0027re glad of it!\" said Tarbox, suspiciously. \"You don\u0027t want to do your duty.\" \"I\u0027ve tried to do it, and it\u0027s no use,\" said the constable, with a little show of spirit. \"If I had the strength of a yoke of oxen, I might do something; as it is, I can\u0027t.\" \"You\u0027d better come quietly, Enoch,\" said Tarbox, his own courage beginning to fail. A crowd had collected about the two, and derisive smiles and remarks greeted the lamentable failure of Tarbox\u0027s scheme of revenge. 57 \"Get a wheelbarrow, mister,\" said a boy from a neighboring town. \"Hadn\u0027t you better try a derrick?\" suggested a man beside him. \"You must be a lunatic!\" said another. \"We\u0027d better go, Mr. Tarbox,\" said Spriggins, uncomfortably. \"I won\u0027t stir,\" said Tarbox, looking around him with a scowl, \"till I see that warrant served. I wish I was a constable.\" \"It wouldn\u0027t be healthy for you, old man!\" said Charlie Davis, who, with Robert, had been drawn to the scene, and heard the colloquy. \"I\u0027d make you healthy if I had you with me for a few minutes,\" said Tarbox, scowling. \"Thank you; you\u0027re very kind, but my time is too valuable,\" said Charlie. \"What is all this?\" asked a voice of authority. It was the voice of the manager, who had been attracted by the crowd as he was going his rounds. \"The matter is that we\u0027ve got a warrant for this man\u0027s arrest!\" said Tarbox, pointing to the giant. \"Show me your warrant!\" 58 It was handed him. He smiled as he read it, and handing it back, remarked, \"Your warrant is mere waste paper, gentlemen.\" \"Why is it?\" asked Tarbox, defiantly. \"Because there is no such man as Enoch in this show.\" \"Isn\u0027t that his name?\" asked Tarbox. \"No, it isn\u0027t. If you can find a man by that name you are welcome to take him.\" \"Crushed again,\" remarked Charlie Davis, mockingly. Tarbox made a grab for the boy\u0027s collar, but failed to secure him. \"Come along out, Spriggins,\" he said, in a tone of deep depression. \"You can go if you like,\" said the constable, independently; \"I\u0027m going to stay and see the show.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83294.html","bookId":277,"book":{"id":277,"title":"The Young Circus Rider or, the Mystery of Robert Rudd","description":"简介： ABOUT three o\u0027clock in the afternoon an oddly assorted couple walked through the main street in the manufacturing town of Crampton.
