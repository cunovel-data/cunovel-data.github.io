{"id":8423,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X. TRAPPED.","content":"ROBERT foresaw that trouble was in store for him, as he had seen enough of the farmer to understand his disposition. However, the boy was not easily startled, nor was he of a nervous temperament. He looked calmly at Tarbox and said: \"Very well, sir, what do you want of me?\" \"What do I want of you? I shouldn\u0027t think you\u0027d need to be told. You remember me, don\u0027t you?\" \"Perfectly well,\" answered Robert. \"Perhaps you can remember where you saw me last?\" \"In the circus last evening.\" \"No, I don\u0027t mean that—before that.\" \"In your own field, trying to whip a poor boy who was going to call the doctor for his sick mother.\" \"Look here, boy,\" said Tarbox, reddening; \"none of your impudence!\" 86 \"Did I tell the truth?\" asked Robert quietly. \"Never mind whether you did or not. I ain\u0027t going to stand any of your impudence. Where\u0027s that big brute Enoch?\" \"If you mean Anak, I left him in the tent.\" \"He needn\u0027t think he can go round insulting and committing assault and battery on his betters,\" said Tarbox. \"You can tell him that if you like, sir; I am not responsible for him.\" \"No, but you are responsible for trespassin\u0027 on my grounds.\" \"I would do it again if I saw you trying to flog a defenceless boy,\" said Robert, independently. \"You would, hey?\" sneered Tarbox. \"Well, now, you may change your opinion on that subject before we part company.\" \"Come, Rob, let\u0027s be going,\" said Charlie Davis, who didn\u0027t find this conversation interesting. \"You can go,\" said Tarbox; \"I hav\u0027nt anything ag\u0027inst you; but this boy\u0027s got to stay.\" \"What for?\" asked Charlie. \"What for? He\u0027ll find out what for.\" 87 \"If you touch him, I\u0027ll send Anak after you,\" said Charlie. \"You will, hey? So you are impudent, too. Well, I\u0027ll have to give you a lesson, too.\" Tarbox felt that it was time to commence business, and made a grab for Robert\u0027s collar, but the boy was agile, and quickly dodging ran to one side. Charlie Davis laughed, which further annoyed and provoked Mr. Tarbox, but the wrath of the farmer was chiefly directed against Robert, who had witnessed his discomfiture at the hands of the Norwegian giant. He therefore set out to catch the young circus-rider, but Robert was fleet-footed, and led him a fruitless chase around trees, and Tarbox was not able to get his hand on him. What annoyed the farmer especially was that the boy did not seem at all frightened, and it appeared to be no particular effort to him to elude his grasp. Tarbox was of a dogged, determined disposition, and the more difficult he found it to carry out his purpose the more resolved he was to accomplish it. It would never do to yield to two boys, who both together had less strength than88 he. It was different from encountering Anak, who was a match for three ordinary men. But Tarbox, in spite of his anger, and in spite of his superior strength, was destined to come to grief. He had not paid any special attention to the younger boy, being intent upon capturing Robert. Charlie, taking advantage of this, picked up a stout stick, which had apparently been cut for a cane and then thrown aside, and took it up first with the intention of defending himself, if necessary. But as Tarbox dashed by without noticing him, a new idea came to Charlie, and thrusting out the stick so that it passed between the legs of the pursuer, Tarbox was thrown violently to the ground, on which he lay for a moment prostrate and bewildered. \"Climb that tree, Rob!\" called out Charlie quickly. Robert accepted the suggestion. He saw that no time was to be lost, and with the quickness of a trained athlete made his way up the trunk and into the branches of a tall tree near at hand, while Charlie with equal quickness took refuge on another. 89 Tarbox fell with such violence that he was jarred and could not immediately recover from the shock of his fall. When he did rise he was more angry than ever. He looked for the two boys and saw what had become of them. By this time Robert was at least twenty-five feet from the ground. \"Come down here, you, sir!\" said the farmer, his voice shaking with passion. \"Thank you, sir,\" answered Robert coolly; \"but at present I find it more agreeable up here.\" \"Come down here, and I\u0027ll give you the worst thrashing you ever had!\" \"Your intentions are very kind, but the inducement isn\u0027t sufficient.\" \"If I hadn\u0027t fallen just as I did, I\u0027d have had you by this time.\" \"That\u0027s just what I thought when I put the stick between your legs,\" called out Charlie Davis from another tree. It may seem singular, but until then Tarbox had not understood how he came to fall. He had an idea that he had tripped over the root of a tree. \"Did you do that?\" he asked wrathfully, turning to the smaller boy. 90 \"Yes, I did.\" \"If I could catch you, you wouldn\u0027t get out of this wood alive.\" \"Then I\u0027m glad you can\u0027t get me,\" said Charlie, looking unconcernedly down upon his stalwart enemy. \"You\u0027re two of the worst boys I ever saw,\" proceeded the farmer, wrathfully. \"And I\u0027m sure you\u0027re the worst man I ever saw.\" \"What\u0027s your name?\" asked Tarbox, abruptly. \"Charlie Davis; I\u0027m sorry I haven\u0027t got my card with me, or I\u0027d throw it down to you.\" \"I\u0027d like to have the bringing up of you.\" \"All right! Perhaps I\u0027ll appoint you my guardian.\" \"You\u0027re more impudent than the other one, though you ain\u0027t so big.\" \"Are you comin\u0027 down?\" he inquired of Robert. \"Not at present.\" \"I won\u0027t stir from here till you do, if I have to stay all night.\" This was not a cheerful reflection, for the two boys were expected to be present and ride in the evening, and their absence would be regretted,91 not only by the manager, but also by the public, with whom they were favorites. \"I say, Rob,\" called out Charlie, \"how fond he is of our company!\" \"So it seems!\" responded Robert, who was quite cool but rather annoyed by the farmer\u0027s persistence. \"I only wish Bruiser were alive!\" said Tarbox. \"Then I\u0027d know what to do.\" \"What would you do?\" asked Charlie. \"I\u0027d leave him to guard you, and then I\u0027d go home and get my gun.\" \"What for?\" \"I\u0027d soon bring you down if I had that,\" answered the farmer, grimly. \"If that\u0027s what you would do I\u0027m glad old Bruiser\u0027s kicked the bucket,\" said Charlie. \"I never shall get such another dog!\" said Tarbox, half to himself, in a mournful voice. \"Nobody dared to go across my ground when he was alive.\" \"Was that the dog that Anak killed?\" asked Charlie. \"Yes,\" answered Robert, briefly. \"He was a vicious-looking brute and deserved to die.\" 92 At that moment Tarbox chanced to notice the stick which had produced his downfall, and a new idea came to him. He picked it up, and breaking it in two seized one piece and flung it with all his force at Robert. The latter caught and flung it back, knocking off the farmer\u0027s hat. Tarbox was naturally incensed, and began again to hurl the missile, but anger disturbed his aim so that this time it went wide of the mark. \"I say, Robert,\" said Charlie, \"this is interesting.\" \"I\u0027m glad you find it so,\" answered Robert. \"I can\u0027t say I enjoy it.\" \"You may just as well come down and take your thrashing now,\" said Tarbox, \"for you\u0027re sure to get it.\" \"If you\u0027re in a hurry to get home to supper, perhaps we\u0027ll wait for you here,\" suggested Charlie, politely. \"Shut up, you saucebox! You won\u0027t have much appetite for supper!\" retorted Tarbox. He sat down where he could have a full view of both trees, when presently he heard Charlie93 call out in a terrified tone, \"Rob, look there! The tiger\u0027s got loose! See him coming this way! Can he climb trees?\" Tarbox stopped to hear no more. He sprang to his feet, and without waiting to bid the boys good-by he took to his heels and fled from the wood, feeling that his life was in peril.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83298.html","bookId":277,"book":{"id":277,"title":"The Young Circus Rider or, the Mystery of Robert Rudd","description":"简介： ABOUT three o\u0027clock in the afternoon an oddly assorted couple walked through the main street in the manufacturing town of Crampton.
