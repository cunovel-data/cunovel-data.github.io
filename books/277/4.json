{"id":8416,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III. THE WRATH OF MR. TARBOX.","content":"COLMAN\u0027S Grand Combined Circus and Menagerie, with its line of showy chariots, its collection of animals from all parts of the habitable world, and its general array of wonders, had pitched its tent in a large otherwise unoccupied lot in the eastern part of the town. An immense tent, capable of containing six thousand spectators, had been erected, and presented a picturesque appearance. All was hurry and bustle in and around the circus tent. Crowds of staring urchins were gathered as near as possible, on the chance of seeing something of the wonders hidden by the canvas. I am afraid more boys played truant on that day than had done so for many previous weeks, for to the mind of the average school-boy there is nothing more seductive than a travelling show. Anak and Robert had been missed, for it was25 not often they absented themselves so long, and it is possible that the heart of the manager might have been stirred by apprehensions lest two of his greatest attractions should have taken French leave and forsaken him on the eve of battle. When they were seen approaching, a boy smaller than Robert ran to meet them. This was Charlie Davis, also a bareback rider, but a year younger than Robert, who performed an act with him. \"Where have you been, you two?\" he asked. \"I thought you\u0027d run away?\" \"If Anak ran away, it would take a fast runner to catch him,\" said Robert. \"No, we\u0027ve been taking a walk.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me? I should like to have gone, too.\" \"You\u0027re not much of a walker, you know, Charlie. Still you might have helped us. We got into a fight.\" \"Where? Who did you fight with?\" asked Charlie, his curiosity aroused. \"With a brutal old farmer, who had tied a boy to a tree, and was going to flog him. You ought to have seen how Anak tamed him down. He26 just took him by the collar, and shook him as a cat would a rat.\" \"What did he do?\" \"He called his dog, a big, ugly brute, named Bruiser. Bruiser\u0027s funeral will take place to-morrow.\" \"I wish I had been with you,\" said Charlie, in a tone of disappointment. \"If you had, I should have let you do the fighting,\" said Anak. \"Well, Charlie, how are things getting on?\" \"Oh, everything is about ready. They\u0027ve laid out the ring, and are putting up the seats. The bearded lady\u0027s sick, and says she shan\u0027t appear if she doesn\u0027t feel better. But they can spare her better than they could us.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Robert, smiling. \"At any rate, we have harder work to do than she, though we may not get as much money.\" \"And it isn\u0027t as good fun, either,\" remarked Charlie. \"That\u0027s true. Well, let us go in and see how things are going on.\" Charlie Davis was a year younger and considerably smaller than Robert, but his line of business27 was the same, and the two rode together well. Young performers are always popular, and the two boys always received their share of applause. Charlie had a more lively temperament than Robert, and being a little fellow was a general favorite among the other performers. Leaving the circus for a time we will go back to Mr. Nathan Tarbox, who had been so signally defeated in his plans of revenge upon his young victim by Anak. As he entered the house he was met by Mrs. Tarbox, who from the window had witnessed with dismay the conflict between her husband and the Norwegian giant. She was a tall, bony woman, not usually demonstrative, but she rushed up to her husband on this occasion in a tremor of excitement and threw her arms round his neck. \"Oh, Nathan!\" she exclaimed, \"I thought that monster would kill you. I shook like a leaf when I saw you in his grasp.\" \"Quit your fooling,\" returned the affectionate husband. \"Why didn\u0027t you come out and help me?\" \"How could I—a delicate woman like me?\" asked Mrs. Tarbox, reproachfully. 28 \"I suppose you wouldn\u0027t have minded seeing me killed before your eyes,\" retorted Nathan with sarcasm; \"you wasn\u0027t too delicate for that. I dare say you\u0027d like to be a widow.\" \"How can you talk so, Nathan? You hurt my feelings. Do be reasonable, now. What could I do?\" \"What could you do? I\u0027ll tell you what you could do. You could have taken the frying-pan and laid it over his head. That\u0027s what you ought to have done. Between us we could have managed the big brute.\" \"You know, Nathan, I couldn\u0027t have reached his head. Who is he? I never saw such a monster before in all my born days.\" \"He\u0027s the Norwegian giant at the circus. If he hadn\u0027t been a giant I could have managed him. There isn\u0027t a man in town but I can handle.\" \"Of course there isn\u0027t. What made him touch you?\" \"It\u0027s all the fault of them bad Graham children that tramped across my fields when I\u0027d told \u0027em not to. I was goin\u0027 to give the biggest one a lesson with a horsewhip, when that overgrown29 ruffian broke in and seized me. I wish I had him tied to a tree just for five minutes,\" said Tarbox, walking the room in his fury. \"Big as he is I\u0027d lash him till he bellowed for mercy.\" \"That would be nice, Nathan dear,\" said Mrs. Tarbox, complacently. \"Nice, Mrs. Tarbox!\" exclaimed her husband, turning the vials of his anger upon her; \"we might have done it, too, if you had had the courage to come out and stand by your husband. You could have seized him from behind, while I gave him a lashing. Instead of that you were standing at the window smirking in your foolish way, I\u0027ve no doubt. A pretty wife you are!\" \"O Nathan, I am sure you don\u0027t know what you are saying. You forget I am a weak, delicate woman.\" Though Mrs. Tarbox was tall, strong, gaunt and bony, she was accustomed to consider herself delicate. It was fortunate that she was not so, and that she was not particularly sensitive, or the brutal temper of her husband would have worn upon her more than it did. She was fortunate in being a silly woman. It saved her much mental suffering. 30 \"You weak and delicate!\" retorted her husband, contemptuously. \"So is a ostrich.\" \"Where\u0027s Bruiser? Why didn\u0027t you call him?\" Mrs. Tarbox had not witnessed the untimely fate of that amiable quadruped. At the mention of Bruiser her husband\u0027s wrath again overflowed. \"He\u0027s dead!\" he shouted. \"That brute killed him.\" \"How did he do it?\" asked his wife, not without curiosity, for she knew the bull-dog\u0027s strength. \"Kicked him to death! That\u0027s how he did it.\" \"He must be very strong,\" murmured Mrs. Tarbox. \"Don\u0027t you think we ought to erect a gravestone over Bruiser,\" she continued, \"just as I did over that sweet canary? A piece of board would do, you know.\" \"Perhaps you\u0027d like to write some lines for it,\" remarked Mr. Tarbox, sarcastically. \"I was thinking, Nathan, we could put something like this: HERE LIES BRUISER! ? Cut off in the flower of his youth— Gone to meet old Towser!\" 31 and Mrs. Tarbox looked up to her husband for his approval. \"Mrs. Tarbox,\" he said, \"I believe you are the greatest fool in town. Have you got any common sense?\" \"Nathan, you shouldn\u0027t talk so to your wife,\" she answered, placidly. \"I only spoke for the best; of course, if you think of anything you like better, I don\u0027t care.\" \"I have no time to think of epitaphs on dogs, Mrs. Tarbox. I\u0027ve got something more important to do. Do you know what I am going to do, Mrs. Tarbox?\" \"Change your shirt, perhaps,\" said his wife; \"you forgot to do it this morning.\" Mr. Tarbox came near swearing. \"No,\" said he, \"I\u0027m going to have that brute arrested for assault and battery, for trespassing on my grounds and killing my dog. That\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do.\" \"So I would, Nathan. I wonder you didn\u0027t think of it before.\" \"Then get supper ready, and I\u0027ll go round and get a warrant for his arrest as quick as I get through.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83291.html","bookId":277,"book":{"id":277,"title":"The Young Circus Rider or, the Mystery of Robert Rudd","description":"简介： ABOUT three o\u0027clock in the afternoon an oddly assorted couple walked through the main street in the manufacturing town of Crampton.
