{"id":8449,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV. THE MYSTERY OF ROBERT RUDD IS SOLVED.","content":"HUGO RICHMOND was in good spirits. All seemed working in his favor. He had got rid of Robert, the rightful heir, and escaped paying Fitzgerald the money he had agreed to pay him. Now his uncle, whose feeble hold on life had so long kept him from the coveted inheritance, seemed getting weaker and weaker every day. He was not positively sick, but he was sad and despondent; his appetite had failed, and he was more thin and shadowy than ever. The wicked nephew could hardly conceal his exultation as he looked on the feeble old man, and calculated how few weeks he probably had to live. \"Yes,\" he said to himself, \"Chestnutwood will soon be mine. And then—then I will take care to be repaid for the slavery of the last eight years.\" 267 Old Mr. Richmond could not read the nephew\u0027s heart, nor did he suspect his baseness. He thought him sincerely devoted to his interests. \"A gentleman to see you, sir,\" announced the servant, interrupting one of Hugo\u0027s day dreams. \"Who is it?\" \"I don\u0027t know, sir; but I think he has been here before.\" When Hugo entered the drawing-room and saw Fitzgerald, he stopped short with a frown. \"You here?\" he said. \"Yes, I am here,\" answered the other proudly. \"You might as well have stayed away. If you think you can levy any black-mail you are mistaken.\" \"I expect nothing of the kind.\" \"Probably you don\u0027t want any money?\" said Hugo, sneering. \"Not from you,\" answered Fitzgerald, eying him steadily. \"You don\u0027t want money?\" exclaimed Hugo, in genuine surprise. \"No, though I have no doubt you would be very glad to give me a large sum.\" 268 \"You are quite mistaken. I suspect you are drunk.\" \"That is where you are mistaken.\" \"What is your object in coming, then? Is this a friendly call?\" asked Hugo, with an evident sneer. \"Well, perhaps it may be so considered; I came to give you a friendly warning.\" \"A warning?\" \"Yes.\" \"I really can\u0027t conceive how I can need any warning from you. What is your warning?\" \"I warn you to leave the country as soon as it is in your power.\" Hugo laughed scornfully. \"Thank you for nothing,\" he said; \"why should I leave the country?\" \"Because you will otherwise be charged with instigating the murder of your cousin, known as Robert Rudd.\" \"Humph! No one will credit it. Besides, you will have to admit that you killed him.\" \"You are mistaken again. He is not dead.\" \"Not dead?\" echoed Hugo, turning pale and sinking into a seat. 269 \"No, he is as much alive as you or I, but I am prepared to swear that you hired me to kill him.\" \"Villain! you deceived me!\" exclaimed Hugo, furiously. \"I feel less a villain than if I had compassed the boy\u0027s death.\" Hugo reflected a moment. A gulf seemed to open before him, and just as his uncle was nearing death all his schemes seemed in danger of failure. This must be prevented at all hazards. \"Fitzgerald!\" he said, in an altered tone, \"this thing can yet be arranged. You have gained an advantage over me, I grant, and I am prepared to make it worth your while to keep this thing hushed up. What are your terms?\" \"Why should I name terms when you have once treacherously gone back on your word?\" \"I will not do so again.\" \"Do you want me to kill the boy?\" \"No! Let him live, but never let him suspect who he is.\" \"And for this you will give me—how much?\" \"Five thousand dollars!\" answered Hugo, after a brief pause. 270 \"It is a good sum, but your uncle\u0027s property amounts to a quarter of a million, at least.\" \"Nothing like it,\" answered Hugo, hurriedly. \"Besides, he is likely to leave a large part to charitable institutions.\" \"Not if you can prevent it,\" thought Fitzgerald. \"It is useless!\" he said aloud. \"I am not to be bought.\" \"What, then, do you require?\" asked Hugo, desperately. \"I require you to leave the country, and acknowledge Robert Rudd as your cousin.\" \"Never!\" said Hugo, fiercely. \"Very well!\" said Fitzgerald, rising. \"What are you going to do?\" asked Hugo, anxiously. \"To leave you to your fate! Within a few hours you will be arrested on a charge of complicity in an attempted murder.\" \"Stay!\" exclaimed Hugo, now thoroughly alarmed. \"How far has this gone? Surely you have not revealed anything to Robert Rudd? \"Everything,\" answered Fitzgerald, laconically. \"To any one else?\" 271 \"Yes, to a lawyer, who is possessed of all the evidence in the case, and is prepared to communicate all to your uncle!\" \"Is this true?\" asked Hugo, pale with dismay. \"You can believe it or not. I have only this to say, that you had better go with me to the hotel where your cousin and his lawyer are now staying, and assure yourself whether we are in earnest.\" \"Suppose I grant your demands and acknowledge the boy?\" \"Then you will be suffered to go where you please unharmed.\" \"I will go with you.\" Hugo accompanied Fitzgerald to the hotel, had a private interview with the lawyer, and decided that opposition was useless. He took care, however, to feather his own nest by appropriating a large amount of government bonds belonging to his uncle, which, in addition to his pickings and stealings for eight years past, provided him with a competency. The theft could not be proved, for he alone had the charge of his uncle\u0027s affairs. With his ill-gotten gains he sailed for Europe, where he is now residing. 272 The joy of Cornelius Richmond when his grandson was restored to him can be imagined. It seemed to bring him back from the grave and restore his strength. A tutor was at once engaged to remedy Robert Rudd\u0027s—now Robert Richmond\u0027s—defective education, and money was actually lavished upon him by his doting grandfather. But Robert stood the test of prosperity as he had stood the test of adversity. He remained the same frank, manly, self-respecting boy, and was not drawn into squandering his money in policy or dissipation. But he delighted to help those of his former associates who were unfortunate and needed assistance—for instance, a trapeze performer, who having fractured a leg by a fall from the trapeze, was left in want with a wife and four young children dependent upon his exertions. For months Robert allowed him $10 a week, and was heartily glad that his grandfather\u0027s liberality allowed him also to be liberal. Our hero rejoiced the heart of his old friend Anak by the gift of a handsome gold watch, and he also remembered others who had been kind to him. He has sent an invitation to Sidney Grey273 to visit him at Chestnutwood, and has requested Squire Grey to transfer the $200 entrusted to him to his son. He had intended to offer a home to Charlie Davis, his associate rider, but Charlie had already attracted the attention of a gentleman, who had offered to adopt him at the close of the present season. My readers may be interested to know that Master Charlie is this very summer travelling with a circus through the New England States and Canada. Having lamed his foot, he, too, is engaged for the time being in selling prize packages and candy, but will probably retire from professional life in October. Hundreds of the boys who read this story will probably see him at some time during the season. Robert is busily employed in remedying the deficiencies in his education, and is already entrusted with a large part of the business connected with the management of his grandfather\u0027s property. From the latter has been concealed Hugo\u0027s wicked attempt to make away with Robert, as it would shock the old man and affect him injuriously. But he seldom inquires for his nephew, to whom he was never much attached. He is quite content with the company of his grandson.274 There are few who know that Robert Richmond, the heir of Chestnut wood, was once ROBERT RUDD, THE BOY WONDER! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83324.html","bookId":277,"book":{"id":277,"title":"The Young Circus Rider or, the Mystery of Robert Rudd","description":"简介： ABOUT three o\u0027clock in the afternoon an oddly assorted couple walked through the main street in the manufacturing town of Crampton.
