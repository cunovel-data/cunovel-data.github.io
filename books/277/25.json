{"id":8437,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. ROBERT MEETS HIS EMPLOYER.","content":"ROBERT RUDD had been in New York more than once, and he therefore had no difficulty in finding out the fine hotel on Broadway known as the St. Nicholas. He entered it, and, walking up to the desk, inquired, \"Is Mr. John Fitzgerald staying here?\" \"Yes,\" answered the clerk. \"Do you wish to see him?\" \"If you please.\" \"Then write your name on a card and I will send it up.\" Robert did so. \"See if No. 35 is in,\" said the clerk, calling a hall boy, and handing him the card. In five minutes the hall boy came back, saying: \"Mr. Fitzgerald wants the young gentleman to come up.\" Robert followed him to a room on the third floor and knocked at the door. 194 \"Come in,\" was heard from the interior. On entering Robert looked with some curiosity at the solitary occupant of the room, who was to be his future employer. He saw a tall, dark-complexioned man neatly dressed in a suit which appeared to be new, since it had not lost its first gloss. Fitzgerald, for it was he, rose promptly, and advanced to meet Robert with an air of great cordiality. \"I am glad to see you, Mr. Rudd,\" he said, extending his hand. \"You were perhaps surprised to receive my letter.\" \"I was still more pleased,\" answered Robert, politely. \"I am glad to hear it, since it gives me the assurance that you regard my offer favorably.\" \"Yes sir, I could not well do otherwise. It is of a tempting character. I am only surprised that you should make me such an offer, knowing so little of me.\" \"Perhaps I know more of you than you imagine,\" said Fitzgerald to himself, with a peculiar look which, however, Robert did not notice. \"I judge of persons quickly!\" he said aloud,195 \"and when first I saw you in the ring it occurred to me that you were just the young person I should like to have travel with me. Of course, I didn\u0027t dream then that there was any possibility of my securing you, for I was not prepared to pay a sum as large as you were doubtless paid at the circus. However, when you were injured by the dastardly trick of some scoundrel, and I subsequently learned that you would be unable to ride for the remainder of the season, it occurred to me that perhaps you would accept my proposal.\" \"I am very glad to do so, and I am very much obliged to you for giving me such a chance. Do you think I can fulfil the duties of the post?\" \"Oh, I should think so. Favor me by writing a line or two from this newspaper. I wish to judge of your handwriting.\" There were writing materials on the table, and Robert complied with the request. Though not a handsome writer, he wrote a plain and legible hand, and with considerable readiness. Fitzgerald scanned it hastily, and said, \"Oh, that will suit me very well.\" 196 \"Do you think I shall be competent to do all you desire?\" \"I feel sure of it. You have travelled considerably, I presume?\" \"Yes, with the circus.\" \"Precisely. Then you know something about hotels, trains, etc. A boy who had always lived at home would not suit me so well. Where is your luggage?\" \"I have only a gripsack—I mean valise—with me.\" \"That is better. Travellers should not be encumbered with too much baggage. It is a great nuisance. Where is it?\" \"I left it below.\" \"You can bring it up to my room. I won\u0027t hire a room for you, for I intend to start this very night for the West by a night train from the Grand Central depot. That won\u0027t be too sudden for you, will it?\" \"O no, sir; I am entirely at your service. I have nothing to detain me in New York.\" \"Go down and get your valise and bring it up here, and I will give you my instructions.\" \"The boy has walked into the trap,\" said Fitzgerald,197 thoughtfully, when Robert left him. \"He is a fine boy, and seems a thorough little gentleman in spite of the way in which he has been brought up. It is a pity to harm him, but my interests and that scoundrel Hugo\u0027s require it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83312.html","bookId":277,"book":{"id":277,"title":"The Young Circus Rider or, the Mystery of Robert Rudd","description":"简介： ABOUT three o\u0027clock in the afternoon an oddly assorted couple walked through the main street in the manufacturing town of Crampton.
