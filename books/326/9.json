{"id":37747,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. MR. EPHRAIM HUXTER.","content":"Mrs. Oakley had determined to send John away, This resolution was easily formed, but it was not quite so easy to decide where to send him. There were plenty of boarding-schools where he might be sent, but these would be expensive, and, besides, Mrs. Oakley was of opinion that John knew enough already. He was very much the superior of Ben in scholarship, and for this she was sorry. She would like to have apprenticed him to a trade; but if this was done while Ben lived in idleness, Mr. Selwyn would be sure to remonstrate, and as the will was not yet found she felt in some fear of his opinion. It was about this time that the stage arrived one afternoon before the gate, and a tall, shabbily dressed man, with a battered valise, descended, and walking up the front path rang the bell. The servant who answered the summons thought she recognized him as a peddler who had called there about a month before. [93] \"We don\u0027t want anything,\" she said, abruptly, nearly shutting the door in the stranger\u0027s face. \"What do you mean?\" he demanded, staring at her in surprise. \"I want to see your mistress.\" \"It\u0027s no use. She won\u0027t take anything of you.\" \"What do you mean by your impudence?\" he said, angrily. \"Hoity-toity,\" said the girl. \"You put on airs enough for a peddler; but it\u0027s of no use. You may take your rubbish off somewhere else.\" \"Who\u0027s a peddler, I should like to know? If you don\u0027t open that door pretty quick, I\u0027ll tell my sister to dismiss you without a character.\" \"Your sister!\" repeated the girl, taken by surprise. \"What has your sister got to do with me?\" \"She gives you a home, and pays you wages, I reckon.\" \"Aint you a peddler, then?\" demanded the girl, incredulously. \"I am Mrs. Oakley\u0027s brother, and you\u0027d better invite me into the house, if you want to stay in it yourself.\" \"Excuse me, sir. I made a mistake. If you\u0027ll walk in I\u0027ll tell Mrs. Oakley you\u0027re here.\" \"That\u0027s the first sensible word you\u0027ve spoken. I\u0027ll put my valise here in the entry.\" [94] \"Well,\" thought the servant, \"if that\u0027s Mrs. Oakley\u0027s brother, I don\u0027t think much of her family. I always thought she belonged to a poor set.\" She went upstairs to the front chamber, where her mistress liked to sit, and said:— \"Your brother\u0027s downstairs. He says he would like to see you.\" \"My brother!\" repeated her mistress, not looking overpleased. \"Yes, he is down in the parlor.\" \"Very well, I will go down and see him.\" The ill-dressed stranger was stretched out in a rocking-chair, in an attitude more comfortable than graceful. He was gazing about the room, and noting with much complacency the evidences of comfort and luxury which the handsome furniture exhibited. It was thus that Mrs. Oakley found him. \"How do you do, brother Ephraim?\" she said, coldly, advancing, and just giving him the tips of her fingers. \"I\u0027m pretty well,\" he answered. \"So the old gentleman\u0027s dead, hey?\" \"If you mean my husband,\" she answered, still with coldness, \"you are right.\" \"It\u0027s all right about the property, hey? How much is left to you?\" [95] \"The whole.\" \"Whew!\" whistled Mr. Ephraim Huxter.—\"Well, you have worked your cards well, that\u0027s a fact.\" \"I\u0027ll thank you, Ephraim,\" said Mrs. Oakley, with dignity, \"not to use such low language, or indulge in such insinuations. I did my duty by my husband, and he showed his confidence in me by leaving me his property.\" \"Well, perhaps that\u0027s the right way to put it,\" said Mr. Huxter. \"I\u0027m glad you have feathered your nest so well.\" \"I must again request you not to indulge in such language,\" said Mrs. Oakley, in tones of displeasure. Mr. Huxter was evidently perplexed. \"Come, Jane,\" said he, \"there\u0027s no use in trying to deceive me. You made a good thing of it in marrying old Oakley, and you needn\u0027t pretend to be broken-hearted because he is dead, and has left you his fortune.\" \"Hush!\" said Mrs. Oakley, closing the door; \"what if the servants should hear you talking in this way?\" \"Well, there is something in that. That girl of yours that came to the door took me for a peddler. She wasn\u0027t going to let me in.\" [96] Mrs. Oakley glanced at her brother\u0027s soiled linen and stained clothes, and did not express any surprise. \"I brought my valise,\" said her brother. \"I suppose it\u0027ll be convenient for me to stay a few days.\" Mrs. Oakley assented rather ungraciously,—in truth she did not care much to present such a man as her brother. She felt that it would make it still more difficult to obtain the position which she desired to maintain in the village. \"I thought maybe I could help you in settling up the estate,\" said Mr. Huxter. \"I don\u0027t think I shall require any assistance. Mr. Oakley was a good business man, and the task is an easy one,\" said his sister, coldly. \"How much does the property amount to?\" asked Mr. Huxter,—the property being in his eyes the main thing to be considered. \"I can\u0027t say exactly.\" \"Well, you can give a guess.\" But Mrs. Oakley did not care to have her brother understand her exact position as regarded money matters. She saw clearly enough that he was already speculating how to turn her prosperity to his own advantage, and this she was determined he should not do. She would like to have kept him at a distance, but[97] she was already feeling one of the inconveniences of wealth. There are some whose chief enjoyment of wealth arises from the happiness which it enables them to impart to others, and some, in Mrs. Oakley\u0027s position, would have been glad to do something for such of their relatives as were in struggling circumstances; but it was not so with her. She was of a stingy, penurious disposition, and did not mean that her money should benefit any one but Benjamin and herself, except the small sum which she felt obliged to spend on John. \"No, I don\u0027t think I could form any estimate,\" she said. \"Mr. Oakley has recently died, you know.\" \"Has he left as much as fifty thousand?\" \"Fifty thousand!\" exclaimed Mrs. Oakley; \"what are you thinking of?\" \"It isn\u0027t much less, I am thinking. At any rate, you\u0027re a rich woman.\" \"I am comfortably provided for.\" \"I wish I was as comfortably provided for,\" said Mr. Huxter. \"Seems to me your ideas have risen some, Jane, since you used to live with me, and bind shoes for a living. You and Ben wouldn\u0027t have been very comfortable, I reckon, if I hadn\u0027t helped you once upon a time.\" [98] \"As to that,\" said Mrs. Oakley, \"I worked for my board. It was no great favor on your part.\" \"At any rate, you thought yourself lucky to get a home. Now, things are changed considerably. You are a rich woman, and—well, I\u0027m hard up.\" \"You always were shiftless, Ephraim,\" said Mrs. Oakley, who saw what her brother was coming to. \"Shiftless!\" repeated Mr. Huxter, in an injured tone. \"I don\u0027t know what you call shiftless. I\u0027ve been a hard-working man; but luck\u0027s never been on my side.\" Mr. Huxter\u0027s nose had a suspicious redness, which seemed to indicate whiskey might have had something to do with his want of luck. This was in fact the case. If he had never made much headway, it was partly, at least, his own fault, as his sister knew well enough. But she knew also that there was very little chance of his amending in that particular, and though she gave him little encouragement by her manner, she felt that she should have to help him at last. \"How are your family?\" asked Mrs. Oakley. \"Oh, about as usual. Wife\u0027s always scoldin\u0027 and complainin\u0027, and the children are fractious. I don\u0027t know what makes \u0027em behave so. My home aint a very happy one, that\u0027s a fact.\" [99] Mrs. Oakley knew that very well. For more than two years, when left a widow, with Ben on her hands, she had found a home in her brother\u0027s family, which proved so far from agreeable, that she finally determined to leave it, and do as well as she could for herself outside. She had been lucky enough to obtain a situation in Mr. Oakley\u0027s family as house-keeper, and this proved the starting-point of a new and prosperous career. During Mr. Oakley\u0027s life, Mr. Huxter had never been near her. This had been at Mrs. Oakley\u0027s special request. She felt that her brother was not calculated to do her any particular credit, and she had succeeded, though with some difficulty, in keeping him at a distance. She had accomplished this by an occasional present, and the distinct intimation that these would cease unless her brother should respect her wishes. Now that she was a widow, he considered that the prohibition was at an end, and had presented himself unexpectedly, and was by no means welcome. At this moment Ben, who wished to see his mother, and was not aware of his uncle\u0027s arrival, entered the room, and, observing the shaggy appearance of the visitor, whom apparently he did not recognize, surveyed him with unconcealed contempt. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986/82313.html","bookId":326,"book":{"id":326,"title":"Luck and Pluck or John Oakley\u0027s Inheritance","description":"简介： What are you going to do with that horse, Ben Brayton?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM"}}
