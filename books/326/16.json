{"id":37754,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XV. MRS. OAKLEY\u0027S NOTE.","content":"John opened the note, little suspecting the nature of its contents. It was as follows:— \"John Oakley:—I have made an arrangement with my brother to have you board with him for the present. As you and Benjamin find it so difficult to agree, it will be much better that you should live apart. If you had not treated him so brutally I should not be under the necessity of sending you away from home. I hope you will give my brother no trouble, but will follow his directions. He understands what course I wish him to pursue with you. If he reports favorably of you, I will send for you to return at a proper time.\" \"Jane Oakley.\" \"P. S. I will forward your trunk by express, early next week.\" John read this cold and unjust letter with mingled anger and dismay. It was hard to have all the blame of his quarrel with Ben thrown upon him, when Ben had been the aggressor, and he had only contended[161] for his just rights. So he was to be exiled from home on Ben\u0027s account. He could not help thinking how happily his father and he used to live together before the present Mrs. Oakley came to the farm as house-keeper. And now she and her son had taken possession, and he was turned adrift. What would his father have thought, could he have foreseen what would happen so soon after his death! These thoughts, and others not less disturbing, passed through John\u0027s mind as he read his stepmother\u0027s letter. Mr. Huxter\u0027s eyes were fixed upon his face in cruel exultation, for he imagined the nature of John\u0027s feelings, and enjoyed his sorrow. \"Well, Oakley, what do you say to that?\" he demanded. \"I don\u0027t know what to say,\" said John. \"No, I presume not. The fact is, you haven\u0027t got anything to say in the matter. My sister is your natural guardian, and she has sent you to me to manage. She says you\u0027re rather a tough subject; but I reckon I can manage you. You\u0027ll find me a little harder to deal with than a woman, I can tell you that.\" John did not reply. Indeed, he hardly knew what Mr. Huxter had been saying. So many thoughts crowded in upon his mind with regard to the sudden[162] change in his position that he paid little attention to what was said. \"Is this the only business on which Mrs. Oakley sent me?\" he asked, at length. \"It\u0027s enough, isn\u0027t it?\" demanded Mr. Huxter, with a laugh. \"So you hadn\u0027t the least idea what was the object of your expedition?\" \"No, I had not,\" said John, indignantly. \"I had no suspicion that it was only a trap.\" \"I knew you hadn\u0027t,\" said Mr. Huxter, laughing with evident enjoyment. \"You were pretty well taken in, hey?\" \"I was taken in,\" said John, shortly. \"Sister Jane was pretty cute. She knew you\u0027d be making a fuss, if you knew. I told her that once I got you here there wouldn\u0027t be any more trouble. So now you know all about it, and you may as well settle down to staying here.\" Mrs. Huxter, to whom all this was news, listened with earnest attention. She was a good-hearted woman, and she couldn\u0027t help pitying John. She liked her sister-in-law, now Mrs. Oakley, no better than John did, and was very thankful when, after a two years\u0027 residence under her roof, she had obtained a position as house-keeper at a distance. She readily came to the conclusion that John had been harshly[163] and unjustly treated, and she could not forbear expressing her sympathy. \"I did not know you were going to remain with us, Mr. Oakley,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll try to make you comfortable as long as you stay.\" \"Thank you, Mrs. Huxter,\" said John, gratefully; for he could understand the kindness which led her to speak. \"You needn\u0027t mister him,\" said Mr. Huxter, roughly. \"It\u0027s ridiculous to call such a boy \u0027Mr.\u0027; it\u0027ll make him put on airs worse than ever.\" \"I do not know his first name,\" said Mrs. Huxter. \"My name is John,\" said our hero. \"Then I will call you so, if you are willing.\" \"If he is willing! Don\u0027t make a fool of yourself, Mrs. Huxter. It makes no difference whether he is willing or not.\" \"I shall be glad to have you call me John,\" said our hero, without regarding Mr. Huxter\u0027s brutal speech. John rose from the table. He had not eaten much, for Mr. Huxter\u0027s coarseness, and the note from his stepmother, had taken away his appetite. \"Won\u0027t you have something more, John?\" asked Mrs. Huxter. \"You\u0027ve eaten very little.\" [164] \"No, thank you. I don\u0027t feel much appetite this morning.\" He took his hat, and was about to leave the house by the back door which led out of the kitchen. \"Where are you going, Oakley?\" demanded Mr. Huxter. \"I am going out for a walk,\" said John, shortly. Mr. Huxter hesitated whether to obey the dictates of the petty tyranny which impelled him to forbid John to go out, but finally decided not to interfere at present. He contented himself, therefore, with saying:— \"I expect you to return within an hour.\" John made no reply, but his manly spirit revolted against such contemptible despotism. He did not recognize Mr. Huxter\u0027s authority, and did not mean to. He resolved to take an independent stand at once, and return when he pleased, and no sooner. I wish it to be distinctly understood that John did not expect, at his present age, to enjoy all the privileges of a grown man. He was always respectful to rightful authority, but he considered that Mr. Huxter\u0027s authority was not rightful, and that his commands ought to have no weight with him. Mr. Huxter did not know the character with which he had to deal. He did not know that John could be as firm under[165] some circumstances, as he was compliant in others. If he had known him better he might have felt less confident of triumphing over him. When he left the room Huxter turned to his wife, and said, harshly:— \"I\u0027ve got something to say to you, Mrs. Huxter. You needn\u0027t trouble yourself to take that boy\u0027s part. He is a proud-spirited young rascal, and he needs taking down.\" \"He seems to me a very good sort of boy,\" said his wife. \"That shows what a good judge you are,\" said Mr. Huxter, with a sneer. \"He\u0027s a young bully, and was all the time fighting with Ben.\" \"I always thought Ben inclined to be a bully,\" said Mrs. Huxter. \"Well, he is a proud young upstart,\" admitted his uncle, who had not forgiven Ben\u0027s disdain. \"Got some of the Brayton blood in him. But the other\u0027s just as bad. It\u0027s six of one and half a dozen of the other. However, wife,\" pursued Mr. Huxter, with a change of tone, \"it\u0027s likely to be a good thing for us. We\u0027re to have six dollars a week for boarding young Oakley.\" \"That\u0027s very good pay. I really think we ought to make him comfortable.\" [166] \"He won\u0027t get much favor from me. I promised Jane I\u0027d break his proud spirit, and I\u0027m going to do it. I shall set him to work next week in the shop.\" \"Set him to work while we are getting six dollars a week for his board!\" exclaimed Mrs. Huxter, in astonishment. \"Yes, that\u0027s what Jane told me to do.\" \"But his work alone will more than pay his board.\" \"All the better for us.\" \"But I don\u0027t think, Mr. Huxter, you have the right to do it.\" \"That shows how little you know about it. Isn\u0027t Jane his guardian?\" \"Does she agree to the arrangement?\" \"Of course she does. She told me I might do it.\" \"And she will be willing to pay his board besides?\" \"Yes. You see I represented to her that now she was a rich woman she ought to do something for her only brother, and that\u0027s the way she\u0027s going to do it. It\u0027s a good thing for both of us. She gets rid of a troublesome young rascal, and I get handsomely paid for taking charge of him. It\u0027s a very simple arrangement.\" [167] \"I can\u0027t seem to think it\u0027s right,\" said Mrs. Huxter, slowly. \"Then you\u0027re a fool,\" said Mr. Huxter, not very politely. \"I\u0027m afraid there\u0027ll be trouble,\" thought Mrs. Huxter, nervously, but she did not reply. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986/82320.html","bookId":326,"book":{"id":326,"title":"Luck and Pluck or John Oakley\u0027s Inheritance","description":"简介： What are you going to do with that horse, Ben Brayton?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM"}}
