{"id":37753,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. MR. HUXTER AT HOME.","content":"When John awoke the next morning he found it difficult at first to understand where he was; but recollection soon came to his aid, and he remembered that he was Mr. Huxter\u0027s guest. He rose from the cot-bed, and, going to the window, looked out. The prospect was not a very pleasant one. Just across the street was a pasture, with here and there a gnarled and stunted tree. The immediate neighborhood of Mr. Huxter\u0027s house has already been described. \"I don\u0027t wonder they call it Hardscrabble,\" thought John. \"I shouldn\u0027t like to live here.\" At this moment Mr. Huxter\u0027s head was thrust in through the open door. \"Come, Oakley,\" said he, \"it\u0027s time to get up. We don\u0027t want any lazy folks here.\" \"I was tired with my ride yesterday, and overslept myself,\" said John. \"Well, dress as quick as you can,\" said Mr. Huxter, turning to descend the stairs. [152] \"I don\u0027t see any washbowl,\" said John, hesitating. \"You can come downstairs and wash, like the rest of us,\" said Mr. Huxter. \"You needn\u0027t expect us to lug up water for you.\" John did not reply to this rude speech; but he could not avoid being struck by the change in the manner of his host. Mr. Huxter had, when first introduced, treated him with elaborate politeness. Now he treated him with downright rudeness, and as if he possessed some authority over him. John did not understand this, nor did he like it; but as it was only for a few days at the farthest, he resolved not to repay rudeness with rudeness, but to behave with as much respect as circumstances would allow. In the mean time he would ascertain as soon as possible the object of his visit, and so hasten matters as to allow of his return home with as little delay as possible. Dressing hastily, he went downstairs, and found the breakfast-table spread in the kitchen. Mr. Huxter was seated at the table in his shirt-sleeves. \"Down at last, Oakley,\" he said. \"Sit right up.\" \"I should like to wash first,\" said John. \"Well, there\u0027s the sink, and there\u0027s a tin basin,\" said Mr. Huxter. \"Wait a minute, Mr. Oakley,\" said Mrs. Huxter, \"I\u0027ll wash out the basin for you.\" [153] \"It\u0027s clean enough,\" said her husband. \"No, there\u0027s been some greasy water in it,\" said Mrs. Huxter. \"You\u0027re mighty anxious to wait on him,\" sneered Mr. Huxter. \"You don\u0027t seem to think me of any consequence.\" His wife did not reply. Poor woman! she had a hard time of it. She had always had to contend with poverty; but poverty is not the worst of evils. If her husband had been reasonably kind, she could have borne that without repining, though it subjected her to many privations which she well knew might have been avoided had not her husband been so shiftless and intemperate. But his temper was far from sweet. He was that detestable character, a domestic tyrant, and did all in his power to make his wife uncomfortable and unhappy. She had learned that her best course was to permit his taunts and harsh words to pass unheeded, for at such times reason had no weight with him. It did not take John long to understand the position of affairs. He saw that Mrs. Huxter was disposed to be polite and kind to him, and he felt grateful. He could not help pitying her for having such a husband. [154] \"Thank you, Mrs. Huxter,\" he said, when she had prepared the basin for him. \"I suppose you are accustomed to washing in your own room,\" she said. \"Yes,\" said John; \"but it\u0027s of no consequence. I can wash down here just as well.\" \"Of course you can,\" said Mr. Huxter. \"Come, be spry there, Oakley.\" John washed himself deliberately, not thinking that it was necessary to hurry himself on Mr. Huxter\u0027s account, and sat down to the table. \"You\u0027re an enterprising young man,\" said Mr. Huxter. \"I\u0027m half through my breakfast, and you\u0027re just ready to begin.\" \"He had a long and tiresome journey yesterday,\" said Mrs. Huxter. \"No wonder he was tired.\" \"So had I,\" said her husband. \"You don\u0027t seem to think I can ever get tired, even when I\u0027ve been working like a dog.\" \"What time is it?\" asked John. \"Most seven.\" \"Seven is our breakfast-hour at home,\" said John, quietly. \"As you did not tell me you breakfasted earlier here, you could not expect me to get up sooner than I did.\" \"That\u0027s true, Mr. Oakley,\" said Mrs. Huxter. [155] \"So you\u0027re siding with him,—are you?\" said Mr. Huxter, angrily. John was far from being a coward. He was disposed to treat every one with courtesy and respect, but expected to be treated in the same way. Mr. Huxter\u0027s manner was so very offensive, and his words so dictatorial, that his anger was excited. He felt that he could not with proper self-respect remain silent longer. \"Mr. Huxter,\" he said, fixing his eyes calmly on the face of his host, \"you seem to forget that I am your guest, and entitled to be treated with common politeness.\" \"Mr. Oakley is quite right,\" said Mrs. Huxter. \"You have been very rude to him.\" \"Do you mean to say I\u0027m not polite?\" demanded Huxter, raising his voice. It was not certain to whom this question was addressed,—to John or his wife. But John, who did not wish to get Mrs. Huxter into trouble on his account, hastened to reply:— \"You can judge for yourself, Mr. Huxter, whether you have treated me as I had a right to expect. I came here with you to oblige your sister, Mrs. Oakley. When the business is over, I shall go back. I suppose it will only occupy a short time. I shall try[156] to make you as little trouble as possible, and if you will let me know the rules of your house I will try to conform to them. To-morrow morning I shall be downstairs in time for breakfast.\" Mr. Huxter would have been angry at these words, but the secret thought that John was in his power moderated his resentment. He laughed in his sleeve at the thought of John\u0027s dismay, when he learned that he was not here on a visit, but to remain for an indefinite period. This fact he had not mentioned even to his wife, who, therefore, could not help wondering what could be John\u0027s business. \"You\u0027ve made quite a speech, Oakley,\" said he, sarcastically. \"You may think it all right to charge a man with impoliteness in his own house, but for my part I think it cursed impudent.\" \"I do not intend to be impudent,\" said John. \"I don\u0027t know what you intend, but you are so,\" said Huxter. \"I hope you won\u0027t mind what he says,\" said Mrs. Huxter, distressed. \"Shut up, Mrs. Huxter! I\u0027d rather you wouldn\u0027t interfere. I\u0027ll have it out with this young man without any help from you.\" \"I don\u0027t understand you, Mr. Huxter,\" said John,[157] with dignity. \"I have tried to treat you with proper respect.\" \"Yes, you\u0027ve tried very hard.\" \"And I don\u0027t know why you have taken offence. I should like to know how long I am likely to be detained here on the business which has brought me here.\" \"Why do you want to know?\" \"Because I think it would be better for both of us that I should go to the hotel, if there is one in the village. I am afraid we are not likely to agree very well, and then I shall not interfere with any of your arrangements.\" \"Who do you expect is going to pay your hotel bills?\" demanded Mr. Huxter, with a sneer. \"I think there will be no difficulty about that,\" said John. \"If you think my sister will pay any such bills you are mistaken.\" \"As I came here on business of hers she will probably pay it. If she is unwilling, I will pay it myself.\" \"Indeed!\" said Mr. Huxter, pricking up his ears. \"Where will you get the money?\" \"I hope you will not take offence, Mr. Huxter, if I decline to answer that question.\" [158] \"Have you got any money with you?\" \"I decline answering.\" Mr. Huxter was about to make an angry reply; but a moment\u0027s thought led him to change his purpose. He was anxious to find out how much money John had. \"Have you got money enough to keep you at the hotel a week?\" \"Shall I need to remain here a week?\" asked John, a little disturbed at the thought of having his studies interrupted for so long a time, especially as there seemed so little prospect of deriving any enjoyment from his visit. \"Perhaps longer.\" \"If I don\u0027t have money enough, I will write to Mrs. Oakley for more,\" he said. \"I can tell you beforehand that you won\u0027t get any.\" \"We won\u0027t dispute about that,\" said John. \"I shall be glad to go about this business at once, as I do not wish to be kept away from my studies any longer than is absolutely necessary.\" \"I\u0027m thinking, young man,\" said Mr. Huxter, \"that it will be a good while before you go back to your Latin and Greek.\" \"Why so?\" said John. \"Read that, and you\u0027ll know,\" said Mr. Huxter; and he drew a note from his pocket, and handed it to John.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986/82319.html","bookId":326,"book":{"id":326,"title":"Luck and Pluck or John Oakley\u0027s Inheritance","description":"简介： What are you going to do with that horse, Ben Brayton?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM"}}
