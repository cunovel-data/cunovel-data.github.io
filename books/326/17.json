{"id":37755,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. MR. HUXTER MAKES A DISCOVERY, AND SO DOES JOHN.","content":"John felt that he was in a difficult situation, and he went out, not so much for a walk, as to gain time to consider what he should do under the circumstances. He guessed without much difficulty the reason which had led to his banishment. Mrs. Oakley did not like him, he was aware, and it was natural that she should take measures to remove him from the house. But John felt that, though this was one reason, it was not the principal reason. He was satisfied that she wished to have him out of the way while she was looking for the will. But since the discovery of the will could only be of advantage to him, and strip her of two-thirds of the property, he was forced to the conclusion that, if she found it, it would be only to destroy it, or put it away where he would never be likely to find it. He was thoroughly convinced of this, but he asked himself in vain what he could do under the circumstances. There he was[169] at a loss. He could not return and force Mrs. Oakley to keep him at home, or if so, he well knew that she would manage to make his position very uncomfortable. Mrs. Oakley certainly had every advantage over him. It would not be prudent, he knew, to reveal his suspicion, for he had no proof to bring forward. What should he do? Mrs. Oakley meant him to remain with her brother; but he had already seen enough of Mr. Huxter\u0027s petty tyranny and intemperate habits, to decide that he could never be happy or ordinarily comfortable with him. Of the two, Mrs. Oakley seemed preferable. Mrs. Huxter, to be sure, seemed to be a good-hearted woman, but she was a victim of her husband\u0027s tyranny, and her well-meant interference, without doing him any good, would very likely bring her into trouble. Finding his perplexity only increase, John adopted a sensible resolution. He determined to lay the matter before some one who was older and wiser than himself, and be guided by his advice. He decided to write to Squire Selwyn, his father\u0027s lawyer and friend, who was already well acquainted with all the circumstances of the case, and ask his advice. If he should write at once, he calculated that an answer might reach him by the fourth day, and until then he[170] thought he could endure Mr. Huxter\u0027s disagreeable manners. As to the will, he thought it more than probable that it would never be found, or, if found, it would never do him any good. If Mrs. Oakley would carry out his father\u0027s plans, permit him to continue his studies and go through college, he would then be able to make his own way, and would not trouble himself about the property. While engaged in these reflections he had been slowly walking up the road towards the village. It was not much of a village, not more than twenty houses in all, including a church, a school-house, the tavern, and a store. Knowing something of the custom in country villages, John rightly concluded that the post-office would be found in the store. He entered therefore, and looked about him. It was a common country store, with a stock of a very miscellaneous assortment of articles, from sugar and dried apples to calico and tape. One corner was appropriated to the use of the post-office. John walked up to the counter and asked:— \"Have you any writing paper and envelopes?\" \"Yes,\" said the clerk, producing the articles. John bought two sheets of paper and two envelopes, thinking he might have occasion to write two letters, and then asked when the mail went out. [171] \"It has already gone.\" \"When will the next mail go?\" \"To-morrow morning.\" \"Will you allow me the use of your ink to write a letter?\" \"Certainly. Just step behind the counter.\" John followed directions, and, sitting down at the desk, commenced writing. He thought it better to write here than to do so at Mr. Huxter\u0027s, knowing that the suspicions of the latter would be excited. It is not necessary for me to transcribe John\u0027s letter. He contented himself with stating plainly the situation in which he found himself, and the manner in which he had already been treated by Mr. Huxter, and wound up by asking Squire Selwyn\u0027s advice. Having concluded the letter, he directed it neatly, and, prepaying the postage, handed it to the clerk. \"All right,\" said the latter. \"It\u0027ll go to-morrow morning.\" When this matter was disposed of John felt more comfortable. He had transferred the responsibility of deciding what he should do to another in whom he had great confidence, and so felt a burden removed from his own shoulders. He thought he could stand Mr. Huxter\u0027s harsh treatment for a few days. Meanwhile, with the usual elasticity of youth, he began to[172] feel an interest in the new scenes by which he was surrounded. He had never before been so far away from home, and though Jackson was not a very attractive place, it was new, and so had a certain charm for him. About half a mile distant he saw a hill, which, though barren pasture land, would afford him a good view of the village. He determined to climb it, and look about him. We must now return to Mr. Huxter. Half an hour or more after John left the house he began to feel thirsty,—not that natural, healthful thirst to which we are all subject, but the artificial, craving thirst of one who has accustomed himself to the drinking of alcoholic mixtures. Thanks to the advanced payment for John\u0027s board which he had received from his sister, he was unusually well supplied with funds, and felt that he need work no more than he chose. After splitting up a little wood, therefore, he turned out of the yard, and walked towards the tavern. He went into the bar-room, and received a cordial greeting from the landlord, of whom he was a pretty steady customer. \"Good-morning, Huxter, where have you kept yourself for two or three days? You haven\u0027t been round to see me.\" \"I\u0027ve been making a visit to my sister,\" said Huxter. [173] \"Oh, that\u0027s it. I began to think you had taken the temperance pledge, and given up your old friends.\" \"I haven\u0027t come to that yet,\" said Mr. Huxter, in a tone which indicated that he considered taking the pledge a very discreditable proceeding. \"No; I thought you\u0027d have too much sense for that. What\u0027ll you have this morning?\" \"Give me a glass of something stiff. Let it be extra good, for I\u0027m going to pay up the old score.\" No doubt it was extra good, for Mr. Huxter drank it with evident enjoyment, and immediately ordered another glass. This, too, was drank, and after a little desultory conversation Mr. Huxter left the tavern. It occurred to him that his stock of tobacco was out, and he went into the store hard by to lay in a fresh supply. While he was paying for it the clerk said:— \"You brought a boy home with you, Mr. Huxter, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Yes. How\u0027d you know?\" \"I saw him on the stage, and somebody said he got off at your house. Going to stay with you?\" \"Yes, I\u0027ve taken charge of him.\" \"He seems a good sort of boy.\" \"When did you see him?\" asked Mr. Huxter. \"This morning. He only went out from here a few minutes ago.\" [174] \"Humph!\" said Mr. Huxter. \"Did he buy anything?\" \"Only two sheets of paper and two envelopes.\" A light began to dawn upon Mr. Huxter. John wanted to make trouble by writing home. \"Look here,\" said he; \"if the boy brings in a letter you needn\u0027t send it. Keep it, and hand it to me.\" The clerk looked surprised. Mr. Huxter, finding some explanation necessary, continued:— \"He\u0027s a very troublesome boy. He\u0027s almost broken his poor mother\u0027s heart,—she\u0027s my sister,—and I\u0027ve agreed to take charge of him for a time. It takes a man to manage him. But it won\u0027t do for him to be writing home and making a fuss. You understand?\" \"I shouldn\u0027t have thought him so troublesome. He looks very quiet.\" \"You can\u0027t judge from appearances,\" said Mr. Huxter, shaking his head. \"He don\u0027t show out before folks. So, if any letters are put in directed to Hampton, just keep them, and I\u0027ll look them over. If they\u0027re proper to send, I will let them go.\" \"He wrote a letter here this morning.\" \"Did he?\" asked Mr. Huxter, his eyes sparkling. \"The young rascal\u0027s prompt. It\u0027s lucky I came in. He was cunning enough to write here, that I might not know anything about it. Let me see the letter.\" [175] The clerk, not doubting Mr. Huxter\u0027s authority, handed him the letter. He broke it open hastily, and read it. It is needless to say that John\u0027s description of himself, though moderately expressed, was far from complimentary, and Mr. Huxter\u0027s heart was stirred with indignation. \"The young rascal shall pay for this,\" he thought. \"This letter is not fit to send,\" he said, aloud. \"It would only make trouble. I will take charge of it. The boy needn\u0027t know but it is gone. You may take any letter he brings; but mind you don\u0027t send it till I have seen it.\" \"Very well,\" said the clerk; but he could not help pitying John, if he was to be under Mr. Huxter\u0027s guardianship. In a small village like Jackson every man\u0027s failings were a matter of general knowledge, and the estimation in which Mr. Huxter was held was not very high. \"Well, I\u0027ve defeated the young rascal,\" thought Mr. Huxter, triumphantly, as he left the store. \"He\u0027ll find it isn\u0027t so easy to outwit me. If Jane can\u0027t manage him I can, and I intend to. I reckon it\u0027ll be some time he\u0027ll have to wait for an answer to that letter.\" This thought amused Mr. Huxter, so that he partly forgot his vexation at the unflattering description of[176] himself which the letter contained. Having no further business to attend to, he went up the road towards home. The letter he put in one of the side-pockets of the loose coat which he wore. But there was a large hole in his pocket, and without Mr. Huxter\u0027s knowledge the letter slipped through. He kept on his way, not suspecting his loss. The letter remained unnoticed in the grass by the side of the road, having been wafted there by the wind, until John, on his way home an hour and a half later, happened to catch sight of it. He went to pick it up, not suspecting what it was, and was immeasurably surprised when he found it to be the same letter he had put into the post-office two hours before. How came it there? John was not long in guessing the truth. Mr. Huxter was determined that he should not communicate with any one in Hampton, and had recalled the letter. No doubt he had given instructions to the postmaster, which would make it impossible for John to post any letters in future in the village. \"I am very glad to know this,\" thought John; \"I shall know better how to act.\" He put the letter in his pocket, and kept on his way, determined to keep his discovery to himself. He began to see what sort of man he had to deal with. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986/82321.html","bookId":326,"book":{"id":326,"title":"Luck and Pluck or John Oakley\u0027s Inheritance","description":"简介： What are you going to do with that horse, Ben Brayton?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM"}}
