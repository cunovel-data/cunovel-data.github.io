{"id":37751,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII. AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY.","content":"John could not help wondering what inference Mrs. Oakley would draw from seeing him in consultation with the lawyer. He anticipated that it would arouse her suspicions, and lead to his being treated with greater coldness and harshness than ever. It was with considerable surprise, therefore, that on presenting himself at the supper-table he received a very pleasant greeting from his stepmother. She made no allusion to having met him, but, in her conversation with her brother, asked two or three questions of John, in an easy way, as if the relations between them were perfectly cordial. Ben glanced at his mother once or twice in surprise, for she had not seen fit to take him into her confidence, and he did not understand what this sudden cordiality meant. John, who had usually been excluded from any share in the conversation, was not only surprised, but pleased, and hoped that the change would be permanent.[130] His resentment was not lasting, and he was prepared to respond to his stepmother\u0027s advances. Mr. Huxter\u0027s conduct puzzled him a little. That gentleman seemed disposed to be quite affable and social. \"I hope, Mr. Oakley, you and Benjamin will some time favor me with a visit at my humble home. I cannot promise you as good accommodations as you have at home, but I shall be very glad to see you—very.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said John. Ben, who was not remarkable for politeness, did not deign a word in reply to his uncle\u0027s invitation. In spite of Mr. Huxter\u0027s not very prepossessing exterior John began to think him quite a pleasant man, and felt obliged to him for his invitation, though he felt no particular desire to accept it. After supper was over, Mr. Huxter turned to John:— \"I am going out on the door-step to smoke my pipe. I suppose you don\u0027t smoke?\" \"No, sir,\" said John. \"I was going to ask you to join me; but of course you don\u0027t smoke. It isn\u0027t good for boys. Do you smoke, Ben?\" \"I don\u0027t smoke a pipe,\" said Ben, glancing with[131] some disgust at the clay pipe, the bowl of which his uncle was filling. \"I suppose you, being a young gentleman, smoke cigars. They are more aristocratic. But I\u0027m a poor man, and I can\u0027t afford them. Well, if you\u0027ll get your cigar, we\u0027ll have a social smoke together.\" \"I\u0027ve got an engagement,\" said Ben, not very graciously, and, putting on his hat, he stalked off. \"He\u0027s an impudent puppy,\" said Mr. Huxter to himself. \"I wish I had the training of him for a little while. But I must put up with his insults, or lose all hope of help from my sister.\" \"Come home early, Benjamin,\" said his mother. \"Oh, you needn\u0027t sit up for me. You go to bed so precious early it doesn\u0027t give me any evening at all.\" Mrs. Oakley followed him with her eyes a little uneasily. While Mr. Oakley was alive Ben kept pretty straight, for he stood somewhat in awe of his stepfather; but since his death he had shown a disposition to have his own way, and his mother\u0027s wishes weighed very little with him. She could not help feeling that the boy in whom her dearest hopes centred, and for whom she was willing even to wrong another, manifested very little gratitude for her devotion to him. John, whom she charged with lack of respect, treated her at all times much more respectfully[132] than her own son. But Mrs. Oakley was prejudiced, and would not see this. She shut her eyes alike to John\u0027s merits and Ben\u0027s faults, and the latter took his own way, spending the evening in the bar-room and billiard saloon, and learning much that he ought not to have learned. About half-past nine in the evening, when John was studying his lesson in \"Xenophon\u0027s Anabasis,\" he heard a low knock at the door. Supposing it to be one of the servants, he said, carelessly, \"Come in!\" Looking up, as the door opened, he was not a little surprised at the entrance of his stepmother. With the instincts of a young gentleman, he rose hastily, and, drawing a chair, said:— \"Won\u0027t you sit down, Mrs. Oakley?\" \"Thank you, John,\" said his stepmother; \"I will sit down a moment. You are studying, I suppose.\" \"Yes, I was preparing my Greek lesson for to-morrow.\" John tried not to look surprised, but he wondered very much what should have led to a call from Mrs. Oakley, especially at so late an hour. \"You are getting on well in your studies, I have no doubt.\" \"Thank you. So my teacher says.\" \"I am glad to hear it. I am afraid it will be an[133] interruption for you to be absent from school a few days.\" \"Yes, it would be an interruption; but if you wish it, I could try to make it up afterwards.\" \"I came to ask a favor of that kind.\" \"Does she want me to work on the farm?\" thought John, puzzled. But he was not long kept in doubt. \"My brother, who is now stopping here, leaves for home to-morrow morning,\" proceeded Mrs. Oakley. \"There\u0027s a little business I want attended to, which makes it desirable that some one should go back with him. I might send Ben, but I don\u0027t think he would answer the purpose. So I have thought of you.\" \"Does Mr. Huxter go to-morrow morning?\" asked John. \"He has just decided to do so. That, I am aware, gives you but short notice,\" said Mrs. Oakley. \"Shall I need to be away long?\" \"A few days at least. Have you a carpet-bag?\" \"A small one.\" \"That will answer. You can put in a couple of shirts, some collars, stockings, and handkerchiefs.\" \"How shall I know what to do?\" \"My brother will give you all the needful information.[134] And now, good-night. We shall breakfast at six, in order to be in time for the stage.\" \"Very well, I will be ready.\" Mrs. Oakley left the room, and went downstairs, leaving John considerably puzzled by what had happened. He was sorry to be kept from school for a few days even, for he was at the head of his class both in Greek and Latin, and would lose his standing temporarily at least. But it was characteristic of him to be obliging, even at the cost of some self-sacrifice, and therefore he had made no opposition to the wishes of his stepmother, though it did occur to him that, as Ben neither attended school nor did anything else except amuse himself, he might have executed his mother\u0027s commission. However, John knew enough of Ben\u0027s disobliging disposition to suspect that he had been applied to and refused, especially as he could see that he had no great affection for his uncle. Of course he could have no suspicion of the trap which Mrs. Oakley had artfully laid for him, and that the few days\u0027 absence were intended by her to extend to months and possibly years. \"If I am going early to-morrow morning,\" thought John, \"I may as well stop studying and pack my carpet-bag. I wish I had asked Mrs. Oakley where her brother lives.\" [135] John closed his \"Anabasis,\" and found his carpet-bag. Into it he put whatever he thought would be needed in a week\u0027s absence. He did not suppose he should be away longer than that. \"If it were not so late,\" he thought, \"I would run over and tell Sam that I am to be away for a few days. He will be surprised when he don\u0027t see me at school.\" But it was too late, for the village clock just then struck ten, and as he must be up early, John felt that the best thing he could do was to go to bed and get a good night\u0027s sleep, to prepare him for the fatigues of the succeeding day. After a sound and refreshing night\u0027s sleep, John went downstairs the next morning, with his carpet-bag in his hand. The table was spread for breakfast, and Mr. Huxter and Mrs. Oakley had already taken their seats. \"Good-morning, John,\" said Mrs. Oakley; \"you are just in time. Are you all ready to go?\" \"Yes,\" said John. \"Then sit down to breakfast, for the stage will be here very soon.\" \"So I am to have the pleasure of your company, Mr. Oakley?\" said Mr. Huxter. \"I did not anticipate that I should so soon receive a visit from[136] you when I invited you yesterday to my humble home.\" \"In what town do you live, Mr. Huxter?\" asked John. \"Well, folks call it Hardscrabble,\" said Mr. Huxter, with a laugh. \"Is it far away?\" \"We\u0027ll get there to-night if nothing happens,\" said Mr. Huxter. John did not know whether to conclude that Hardscrabble was, or was not, the real name of the town, but did not like to press the inquiry. He never remembered to have heard of a town bearing that name. However, he would know by evening at any rate. He could not help feeling some curiosity as to Mr. Huxter\u0027s home; but neither that gentleman\u0027s appearance nor description of it led him to form a very high idea of its sumptuousness. The breakfast was a substantial one, and Mr. Huxter did justice to it. Indeed, he was seldom wanting in a good appetite, especially when the repast was an inviting one. \"I suppose I shan\u0027t see Ben before I go?\" said he, leaning back in his chair, and picking his teeth with a fork. \"I am afraid not,\" said Mrs. Oakley. \"Ben got[137] home rather late last night, and I suppose the poor boy is tired this morning. I think I had better not disturb him.\" \"Don\u0027t disturb him on my account,\" said his uncle, who did not seem much disappointed by Ben\u0027s absence. \"He\u0027d better have his sleep out. But, sister Jane, if I were you I wouldn\u0027t let him stay out so late in the evening.\" \"You must remember, Ephraim, he\u0027s a young gentleman now. It won\u0027t do to keep him in leading-strings, just as if he were a boy.\" \"I\u0027d keep him in check if he were my boy,\" thought Mr. Huxter; but he saw that it would not be best to say so. \"Well, Jane, of course you know best,\" he said. \"When are you coming to make us a visit?\" \"Not very soon, I am afraid. I can\u0027t leave the farm very well. There are too many things which need attending to.\" \"There\u0027s the stage,\" said John, suddenly. The rumbling of the wheels was faintly heard up the road. All rose from the table, and prepared to go. Mrs. Oakley brought out a covered basket and handed it to her brother. \"I\u0027ve put some sandwiches in this basket,\" she said. \"You\u0027ll be hungry by and by, and it will[138] save you the expense of stopping at a hotel for dinner.\" \"Very good!\" said Mr. Huxter, with satisfaction. \"That\u0027s what I meant to speak about, but I forgot it. I begrudge paying for dinner at a tavern. They always charge you about double what it\u0027s worth. Come, Mr. Oakley, are you ready?\" \"All ready, sir.\" The rumbling of the stage was now distinctly heard. They opened the front door, and made signals for it to stop. The lumbering vehicle was brought to in front of the gate, and the driver jumped from his elevated perch, and opened the door for the passengers to enter. \"I think I\u0027ll take a seat outside, if it makes no difference to you, Mr. Huxter,\" said John. \"Just as you like,\" was the reply. So, while Mr. Huxter got inside, John took a seat beside the driver. \"Where are you going, John?\" asked the driver, who knew everybody in the village, and was on intimate terms with all. \"I\u0027m going away with the gentleman who has just got inside,\" said John. \"Where does he live?\" \"I don\u0027t know the name of the place,\" said our[139] hero, suspecting that Hardscrabble was only a local appellation. \"Be gone long?\" \"Not more than a week.\" Meanwhile, Mrs. Oakley watched the receding stage with satisfaction. When it was out of sight, she entered the house. \"Now,\" said she, \"I\u0027ll look for the will without John Oakley to spy upon me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986/82317.html","bookId":326,"book":{"id":326,"title":"Luck and Pluck or John Oakley\u0027s Inheritance","description":"简介： What are you going to do with that horse, Ben Brayton?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM"}}
