{"id":37742,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III. JOHN\u0027S TROUBLES BEGIN.","content":"After putting Prince in the stable, John went into the house slowly, for he was in no hurry to anticipate what he feared would be an unpleasant interview. \"Where is Mrs. Oakley, Jane?\" he asked of a servant whom he met in the hall. \"She\u0027s in the sitting-room, Master John,\" said Jane. \"She wants to see you immediately.\" \"Very well; I\u0027ll go in.\" He heard steps behind him, and, turning, found that Ben was following him. \"He wants to hear me scolded,\" thought John. \"However, I won\u0027t take any notice.\" Mrs. Oakley was sitting in a rocking-chair. She looked up with a frown as John entered. She had never liked him, but since Ben had declared, falsely, as we know, that John had no more respect for her than a servant, this dislike was greatly increased. [37] She was inwardly determined to make his life as uncomfortable as possible. \"Well, sir,\" she said, \"so you have come at last.\" \"I came as soon as Ben told me you wished to see me,\" said John. \"I only waited till I had put my horse into the stable.\" \"His horse!\" repeated Ben, by way of calling his mother\u0027s attention to the claim to ownership expressed in those words. \"I suppose I ought to consider it lucky that you paid any attention to my words,\" said Mrs. Oakley. \"I hope I have not failed in proper respect,\" said John. \"It was very respectful in you to ride off with the horse, when I had told Ben he might use it.\" \"It was my horse,\" said John, firmly. \"If Ben wanted it, he might ask me.\" \"Ask you, indeed!\" repeated Ben, scornfully; \"you won\u0027t catch me doing that.\" \"It was enough that I told him that he might ride. Didn\u0027t he tell you that?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then what right had you to refuse?\" \"The horse is mine,\" said John. \"It was given me by my father.\" \"He allowed you to use it.\" [38] \"He gave it to me. At the same time he gave Ben a watch, which he is wearing now. He has no more right to demand my horse than I have to claim his watch.\" \"You seem to forget,\" said Mrs. Oakley, coldly, \"that your father saw fit to leave me his property. The horse forms a part of that property, and belongs to me, and it is for me to say who shall ride on it. Ben, you may ride on the horse to-morrow.\" \"Do you hear that?\" demanded Ben, triumphantly, looking towards John. \"I suppose,\" said John, quietly, \"you will order Ben to let me have his watch to-morrow.\" \"I shall do no such thing,\" said Mrs. Oakley, sharply, \"and it is impudent in you to ask such a thing.\" \"I don\u0027t see why it isn\u0027t fair,\" said John. \"It appears to me rather mean in Ben to want both, and leave me neither.\" \"That is for me to decide,\" said Mrs. Oakley. \"There is one thing more I have to speak to you about. My son tells me you were brutal enough to strike him with the whip. Do you deny that?\" \"I never deny what\u0027s true.\" \"Then you did strike him.\" \"Yes, I struck him twice.\" [39] \"And you have the impudence to stand there, and say it to my face!\" \"You asked me, and I have answered you. I don\u0027t see why that should be called impudent.\" \"You glory in your disgraceful action,\" said Mrs. Oakley, sharply. \"Did Ben tell you that he struck me first?\" asked John. \"I am very glad to hear it. It was what you deserved,\" said Mrs. Oakley. \"Then,\" said John, firmly, \"I gave him what he deserved. You can\u0027t expect me to stand still and be struck without returning it.\" \"The only fault I find with Ben is, that he did not strike you more than once,\" said Mrs. Oakley, in an excited tone. John glanced from the mother to her son, who was evidently pleased with the reproaches John was receiving, and said, quietly:— \"I think Ben had better not attempt it.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" demanded Mrs. Oakley, quickly. \"I don\u0027t want to strike Ben, or injure him in any way,\" said John; \"but I mean to defend myself if I am attacked.\" And Ben, though he chose to sneer, knew very well[40] that, quietly as John spoke, he was thoroughly in earnest, and would do precisely as he said. He knew very well, too, that, though he was older and taller than John, he would very likely be worsted in an encounter. He preferred, therefore, that his mother should fight his battles for him. \"You hear, mother,\" he said. \"He defies you. I knew he would. You remember what I told you.\" Mrs. Oakley did remember very well, and the recollection made her angry. \"John Oakley,\" she said, \"you will find that it won\u0027t do to insult me.\" \"I have no wish to insult you, Mrs. Oakley,\" said John. \"I have not forgotten who you are, and I shall try to treat you accordingly.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" said Mrs. Oakley, turning pale with rage. She was misled by the statement Ben had made, and she thought John referred to the fact that she had been his father\u0027s house-keeper,—a point on which she felt sensitive. \"I mean,\" said John, a little surprised at this outburst, \"that I have not forgotten that you are my father\u0027s widow, and as such are entitled to my respect.\" \"Was that what you meant?\" asked Mrs. Oakley, suspiciously. [41] \"Certainly,\" said John. \"What else could I mean?\" Mrs. Oakley turned to Ben, who shrugged his shoulders, intimating that he did not believe it. \"All very fine,\" said his mother, \"but words are cheap. If you think I am entitled to your respect, you will do as I require. Will you promise this?\" \"I would rather not promise,\" said John. \"If it is anything I ought to do, I will do it.\" \"It is something you ought to do,\" said Mrs. Oakley. \"What is it?\" \"I require you immediately to apologize to my son Benjamin, for the blows you struck him with the whip this afternoon.\" \"I cannot do this,\" said John, firmly. \"Why can\u0027t you do it?\" \"Because I had a good reason for striking him. He ought to apologize to me for striking me first.\" \"Catch me doing it!\" said Ben, scornfully. \"I have no fault to find with him for striking you,\" said Mrs. Oakley. \"On the contrary, I think him perfectly justified in doing so. You forced him off the horse after I had given him permission to ride, and I should have been ashamed of him if he had not resisted. I am glad he gave you such a lesson.\" [42] Once more John looked at Ben, and was not surprised to see the smile of triumph that rose to his face as he listened to these words of his mother. \"Well,\" said Mrs. Oakley, impatiently, \"what have you to say?\" \"What can I say? You are determined to find me in the wrong.\" \"It is because you are wrong. I demand once more, John Oakley, will you apologize to my son?\" \"I will not,\" said John, firmly. \"Please to remember that you are left dependent upon me, and that your future comfort will be a good deal affected by the way in which you decide.\" \"Whatever happens,\" said John, who partly understood the threat, \"I refuse to apologize, unless—\" \"Unless what?\" \"If Ben will say that he is sorry that he struck me, I will say the same to him.\" \"Ben will do nothing of the kind,\" said Mrs. Oakley, promptly. \"I should be ashamed of him if he did.\" \"Catch me apologizing to such a whipper-snapper as you!\" muttered Ben. [43] \"Then I have no more to say,\" said John. \"But I have,\" said Mrs. Oakley, angrily. \"You have chosen to defy me to my face, but you will bitterly repent of it. I\u0027ll break your proud spirit for you!\" John certainly did not feel very comfortable as he left the room. He was not afraid of what his stepmother could do, although he knew she could annoy him in many ways, but it was disagreeable to him to feel at variance with any one. \"If my poor father had only lived,\" he thought, \"how different all would have been!\" But it was useless to wish for this. His father was no longer on earth to protect and shield him from the malice of Ben and his mother. Trials awaited him, but he determined to be true to himself, and to the good principles which he had been taught. As for Mrs. Oakley, having once resolved to annoy John, she lost no time in beginning her persecutions. She had a small, mean nature, and nothing was too petty for her to stoop to. John and Ben had been accustomed to occupy bedrooms on the second floor, very prettily furnished, and alike in every respect. It had been the policy of Squire Oakley to treat the two boys precisely[44] alike, although Ben had no claim upon him, except as the son of the woman whom he had married. Now that he was dead, Mrs. Oakley determined that Ben should occupy a superior position, and should be recognized throughout the house as the eldest son and heir. After her unsatisfactory interview with John, just described, in which he had refused to apologize, she summoned Jane, and said:— \"Jane, you may remove John\u0027s clothes from the bedchamber where he has slept to the attic room next to your own.\" \"Is Master John going to sleep there?\" asked Jane, in amazement. \"Certainly.\" \"And shall I move Master Ben\u0027s things upstairs, also?\" \"Of course not,\" said Mrs. Oakley, sharply. \"What made you think of such a thing?\" \"Beg pardon, ma\u0027am; but who is going to have Master John\u0027s room?\" \"You ask too many questions, Jane. It is no concern of yours that I am aware of.\" Jane did not venture to reply, but went out muttering:— \"It\u0027s a shame, so it is, to put Master John upstairs in that poor room, while Ben stays downstairs.[45] He\u0027s a young reprobate, so he is, just for all the world, like his mother.\" The fact was, that John was a favorite in the house, and Ben was not. The latter was in the habit of domineering over the servants, and making all the trouble in his power, while John was naturally considerate, and always had a pleasant word for them. However, Mrs. Oakley\u0027s commands must be obeyed, and Jane, much against her will, found herself obliged to remove John\u0027s things to the attic. She found John already in his chamber. \"Excuse me, Master John,\" she said, \"but I have orders to move your things up to the attic.\" \"What!\" exclaimed John, in amazement. Jane repeated her words. \"Did Mrs. Oakley tell you to do that?\" \"Yes, Master John, and a shame it is.\" \"Is Ben to go up into the attic too?\" \"The mistress said no.\" \"Wait a minute, Jane; I\u0027ll go and speak to Mrs. Oakley.\" John went downstairs, and found his stepmother in the room where he had left her. \"May I speak to you a moment, Mrs. Oakley?\" he said. [46] \"Have you come to apologize for your impertinence to me, and your rudeness to my son?\" \"No, I have not,\" said John. \"Then I don\u0027t care to speak to you.\" \"Excuse me, Mrs. Oakley, but Jane tells me that you have ordered her to remove my things to the attic.\" \"Well?\" \"Is Ben to go into the attic too?\" \"No, he is not.\" \"Then why are you driving me from my room?\" \"You seem to forget that you are only a boy. This house is mine, and I shall make what arrangements I please.\" \"The room in the attic is not nearly as good as my present room.\" \"It is good enough for you.\" \"I am willing to go up there if Ben goes up, but I claim to be treated as well as he.\" \"Ben is older than you. Besides, he is respectful and dutiful, while you are impertinent and disobedient. I shall treat you as well as you deserve.\" \"Why did you not make this change while my father was alive, Mrs. Oakley?\" said John, significantly. [47] Mrs. Oakley colored, for she understood very well the meaning of this question. \"I do not intend to be catechised by you,\" she said, sharply. \"I intend to do what I please in my own house, and I shall not submit to have my arrangements questioned.\" \"May I ask how my room is going to be used?\" said John, who wanted to be sure whether his stepmother had any motive for the change except hostility to himself. \"No, you may not ask,\" she said, angrily; \"or if you do, you need not expect any answer. And now I will thank you to leave the room, as I have something else to do besides answering impertinent questions.\" There was nothing more to say, and John left the room. \"Well, Master John,\" said Jane, who had waited till his return, \"what will I do?\" \"You may move the things upstairs, Jane,\" said John. \"It\u0027s a shame,\" said Jane, warmly. \"Never mind, Jane,\" said John. \"I don\u0027t like it much myself, but I dare say it\u0027ll all come out right after a while. I\u0027ll help you with that trunk. It\u0027s rather heavy to carry alone.\" [48] \"Thank you, Master John. Ben wouldn\u0027t offer to help if he saw me breakin\u0027 my back under it. It\u0027s easy to see which is the gentleman.\" The room to which John\u0027s things were removed was uncarpeted, the floor being painted yellow. It had been used during Squire Oakley\u0027s life by a boy who was employed to run errands, but who had been dismissed by Mrs. Oakley, who was disposed to be economical and save his wages. The bed was a common cot bedstead, comfortable indeed, but of course quite inferior to the neat French bed in which John had been accustomed to sleep. There was a plain pine table and bureau, in which John stored his things. There was a small cracked mirror, and a wash-stand with the paint rubbed off in spots. Altogether it was hardly suitable for a gentleman\u0027s son to sleep in. John, however, was not proud, and would not have minded if there had not been malice on the part of his stepmother. He had scarcely got moved when a step was heard on the attic stairs, and Ben came up to enjoy the sight of John\u0027s humiliation. \"So you\u0027ve got a new room, John?\" he said, smiling maliciously. \"So it seems,\" said John, quietly. \"I\u0027m sorry to lose so agreeable a neighbor,\" he continued. [49] \"Are you?\" said John, looking at him searchingly. \"But you\u0027ll be more at home up here,\" said Ben. \"What do you mean by that?\" \"I mean it\u0027s more suitable for you.\" \"Ben Brayton,\" said John, his eyes flashing, \"if you have come up here to insult me, the sooner you go down the better. Your mother has moved me up here, for what reason I don\u0027t know. The only satisfaction I have in the change is, that it removes me further from you.\" \"You\u0027re uncommon polite since you\u0027ve moved into this elegant apartment,\" said Ben, tauntingly. \"Elegant or not, it is mine, and I want it to myself,\" said John. \"Leave the room!\" He advanced towards Ben as he spoke. Ben thought a moment of standing his ground, but there was something in John\u0027s eye that looked threatening, and he concluded that it would be the best policy to obey. With a parting taunt he backed out of the chamber, and John was left to himself.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986/82308.html","bookId":326,"book":{"id":326,"title":"Luck and Pluck or John Oakley\u0027s Inheritance","description":"简介： What are you going to do with that horse, Ben Brayton?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM"}}
