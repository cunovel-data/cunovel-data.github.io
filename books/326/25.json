{"id":37763,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. JOHN IS PURSUED.","content":"Mr. Huxter felt better after a night\u0027s rest. In fact, his injuries had not been as serious as he wished Mrs. Huxter to suppose. The truth is, he was a coward, and even a small sickness terrified him. But with the morning, finding himself very little inconvenienced by his mishap of the day previous, his courage returned, and with it his determination to wreak condign vengeance on John. \"How do you feel, Mr. Huxter?\" asked his wife. \"I feel like whipping that young scamp, Oakley,\" said her husband. \"He has done nothing that deserves punishment, I am sure.\" \"Of course, scalding me is a very slight affair, in your opinion; but I happen to think differently,\" he said, with a sneer. He drew on his pantaloons as he spoke, and seizing a leather strap, left the room. [245] \"Oh, dear,\" sighed Mrs. Huxter, \"I do wish Mr. Huxter wouldn\u0027t be so violent. I don\u0027t see what can have turned him so against that poor boy. I am sure he\u0027s very polite and gentlemanly.\" She wanted to say more, in the hope of dissuading her husband from his harsh resolution, but she dared not. She went to the foot of the attic stairs to listen, fearing that she would hear the sounds of an altercation. She saw Mr. Huxter draw the bolt and enter the chamber, but she was quite unprepared to see him burst forth furiously a minute later, exclaiming in a rage:— \"He\u0027s gone,—the young rascal has escaped.\" \"Escaped?\" repeated Mrs. Huxter, bewildered, for she could not conceive how John could escape from a third-story room when the door was bolted. \"Ha, are you there?\" demanded her husband. \"What do you know of this?\" he asked, suspiciously. \"Nothing at all,\" said Mrs. Huxter. \"I don\u0027t see how he could have got away.\" \"You\u0027ll see plain enough if you come upstairs,\" said her husband. \"He got out of the window.\" \"Jumped out?\" gasped Mrs. Huxter. \"Slid down by the bed-cord, you fool!\" said her husband, who was too angry to be polite. [246] \"I declare!\" exclaimed Mrs. Huxter, in a tone indicating her surprise. \"Did you advise him to run away?\" asked Mr. Huxter. \"Of course not.\" \"And did you know nothing of his going? Didn\u0027t he tell you?\" he asked, suspiciously. \"Not a word. But I\u0027m glad he\u0027s gone,—I really am.\" \"You\u0027re glad we\u0027ve lost six dollars a week, are you?\" growled her husband. \"You\u0027d like to see us starvin\u0027, I suppose. But you needn\u0027t be in such a hurry to be glad. I\u0027ll have him back yet, and then if he doesn\u0027t get the tallest kind of a flogging, that\u0027ll sicken him of running away forever, my name is not Huxter.\" \"You\u0027d better let him go, husband. Don\u0027t go after him.\" \"You\u0027ll oblige me by minding your business, Mrs. Huxter. I shall go after him, as soon as I have eaten breakfast.\" Meanwhile John, feeling very hungry, as was stated at the close of the last chapter, determined to get a breakfast at the first inn on the road. He had only to walk a mile further, when he came to a country inn, with its long piazza, and stable-yard[247] alongside. It had a comfortable look, suggestive of good old-fashioned hospitality. John walked through the front entrance, chancing to meet the landlord. \"Can I have some breakfast?\" he asked. \"Are you travelling alone?\" asked the landlord, who was a Yankee. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, I guess we can give you some. What would you like?\" \"I should like some beefsteak and a couple of eggs.\" \"Coffee or tea?\" \"Coffee.\" \"Very well.\" \"How soon will it be ready, sir? I\u0027ve taken a long walk, and am very hungry.\" \"You won\u0027t have to wait long. Here, Betty, just get up some breakfast for this young man. Beefsteak, boiled eggs, and coffee. As quick as you can.\" In twenty minutes John was told that breakfast was ready. He was shown into rather a cheerless dining-room, but the meat emitted a savory odor, and he enjoyed the meal better, it seemed to him, than ever before in his life. He rose from the table[248] at length with a sigh of enjoyment. Going into the office he called for his bill. \"Fifty cents,\" said the landlord. John produced a two-dollar bill, and the change was returned to him. \"Not going to stay with us?\" said the landlord, interrogatively. \"No,\" said John; \"I\u0027ve got to travel further.\" \"Where may you have come from?\" \"From Jackson this morning,\" said John. \"Did you walk? It\u0027s a pretty long stretch,—hard upon ten miles.\" \"I rode part of the way.\" \"And where are you bound?\" John was beginning to tire of this persistent questioning, and would have declined answering, but that he feared this would excite suspicion. \"I am going to Redport,\" he answered. Redport, as he had ascertained, was the next town on the route. He did not think it necessary to mention that he was going considerably further. \"Redport!\" repeated the landlord. \"Yes. How far is it?\" \"It\u0027s a matter of six miles. Are you going to walk?\" [249] \"Yes, unless I find somebody that\u0027s going that way.\" \"I\u0027m going over myself this afternoon. If you\u0027ll wait till that time you may go with me.\" \"Thank you,\" said John; \"but I don\u0027t think I will wait. I\u0027ve got pretty good legs, and I shan\u0027t mind the walk.\" \"You can get over in two hours easy. Ever been that way before?\" \"No.\" \"Well, it\u0027s a straight road. You can\u0027t miss it.\" John left the landlord\u0027s presence with a feeling of relief. He had declined his offer for two reasons: partly because he did not want to wait till afternoon, but principally because the landlord would be sure to ask where he intended to stop in Redport, which would of course embarrass him. John waited about half an hour, as he did not wish to walk immediately after a hearty meal. Then, having cut a stick from a tree by the roadside, he went on his way. Twenty minutes after his departure, Mr. Huxter rode up to the inn which he had just left. That gentleman had procured a fast horse from the stable, for the pursuit of the runaway. It was rather extravagant, to be sure; but then Mr. Huxter felt that he[250] must have John back at all hazards. He could not afford to let a boy escape who paid him three hundred dollars a year, besides the work he intended to get out of him. Then again, he thought, by proper representations, he could induce his sister to pay all the expenses attending John\u0027s capture. \"It\u0027s only fair,\" he thought, \"that Jane should pay for the team, if I give my time.\" So Mr. Huxter sped along the road at a rapid rate. He had taken the right road by chance, and having met a boy who had met John and described his appearance accurately, he had the satisfaction of knowing that he was on the track of the fugitive. Arriving at the tavern, it occurred to him that John might have stopped to rest, if nothing more. He accordingly descended hastily from the carriage, and accosted the landlord, whom he knew slightly. \"Good-morning, Mr. Jones.\" \"Good-morning, Mr. Huxter. Going to stop with us?\" \"I can\u0027t stop now. Have you seen anything of a boy of about fifteen, rather stout built, who must have passed this way lately?\" \"Blue suit?\" interrogated the landlord. \"Yes; have you seen him?\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say you\u0027re after him?\" [251] \"Yes, I do. But have you seen him?\" \"Yes, he took breakfast here only an hour ago. Son of yours?\" \"No, he was my nephew.\" \"Run away, hey?\" \"Yes; he\u0027s been acting badly, and I suppose he thought I was going to punish him; so the young rascal took to his heels.\" \"Sho! you don\u0027t say so! He paid for his breakfast all right.\" \"You can judge how he came by his money,\" said Mr. Huxter. \"You don\u0027t say so! Well, he is a bad case,\" said the landlord, who concluded, as it was intended he should, that John had stolen the money. \"Well, he don\u0027t look like it.\" \"Oh, he\u0027s a deep young rascal!\" said Mr. Huxter. \"You\u0027d think butter wouldn\u0027t melt in his mouth; but he\u0027s a regular scamp. Which road did he take?\" \"He said he was going to Redport.\" \"What time did he start?\" \"Less than half an hour ago. He can\u0027t have got much over a mile. If you keep on, you\u0027ll be sure to overhaul him.\" \"I\u0027ll do that with a vengeance,\" said Mr. Huxter. [252] \"Thank you for your information, Mr. Jones. I\u0027ll do as much for you some time.\" \"All right. Stop on the way back, won\u0027t you?\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know but I will. I only took a mouthful of breakfast, I was in such a hurry to pursue this young scamp.\" \"Well, it\u0027s an ill wind that blows nobody good,\" thought the landlord. \"The boy\u0027s running away has brought me two customers. I had no idea he was such a young rascal.\" \"I might as well get a good breakfast,\" soliloquized Mr. Huxter. \"I can charge it to Jane. She can\u0027t expect me to chase John Oakley over hill and dale on an empty stomach!\" Mr. Huxter began to indulge in pleasing anticipations of what he would do to John when he had captured him, forgetting the good old rule, that before cooking a hare you must catch him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986/82329.html","bookId":326,"book":{"id":326,"title":"Luck and Pluck or John Oakley\u0027s Inheritance","description":"简介： What are you going to do with that horse, Ben Brayton?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:33 AM"}}
