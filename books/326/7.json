{"id":37745,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. OPEN HOSTILITIES.","content":"From his early boyhood John had been intended by his father to receive a collegiate education. If he should acquit himself with credit in college, he was afterwards to have his choice of studying a profession, or entering mercantile life. At the age of eleven he commenced Latin at the academy, and two years afterwards Greek, and in these he had advanced so far that in a year he would be qualified to enter college. There were six boys in the preparatory class to which he belonged, among them being Sam Selwyn, his intimate friend, who has already been introduced to the reader. From the first John had stood at the head of the class, both in Latin and Greek, Sam ranking second. Although they were rivals in scholarship, there had never been the shadow of a difference between them arising from this cause. Both were of a generous nature, and were strongly attached to each other, and it had long been understood between them[73] that when admitted to college they would room together. John had often talked with his father about going to college, and Squire Oakley had strong hopes of John\u0027s maintaining a high position in his college class, and doing him credit at the institution where he had himself graduated. This made it all the more remarkable that John\u0027s interests had been so entirely neglected in the disposition of his property made by his will. As John was on his way to school, on the morning succeeding Ben\u0027s fall from the horse, he was overtaken by Sam Selwyn. \"How\u0027s your amiable brother this morning, John?\" asked Sam. \"Meaning Ben?\" \"Of course. I hope his health hasn\u0027t suffered seriously from his unexpected bath. Poor fellow! he had a pretty good fright.\" \"Yes, I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll trouble Prince very soon again.\" \"I shan\u0027t soon forget how frightened he looked with both arms around the horse\u0027s neck. I should have felt like laughing, only I was afraid he might come to harm. Now you\u0027ll have Prince to yourself.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that, Sam. I rather think,[74] from something Mrs. Oakley said, that she means to sell Prince.\" \"Sell your horse!\" exclaimed Sam, indignantly. \"She says it isn\u0027t mine. She\u0027s given it to Ben. As Ben don\u0027t dare to use it, I am afraid Prince will have to go,\" said John, sadly. \"I wouldn\u0027t stand it!\" exclaimed Sam, in excitement. \"It\u0027s an imposition.\" \"But what can I do?\" \"The horse is yours.\" \"Not legally, I am afraid. I can\u0027t prove it, and Mrs. Oakley says it was only mine to use.\" \"Whether you can prove it or not, the horse is yours, and I say it will be an outrageous thing if it is sold. At any rate you ought to demand the money that is received for it.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what I have made up my mind to do. Mrs. Oakley may say that the horse is expensive to keep, but as Ben received a watch and chain at the same time I got the horse, it is only fair that I should have a watch in place of it, if it is sold.\" \"Of course, that is only reasonable.\" \"Not that a watch would pay me for the loss of Prince. I\u0027d rather have him than three watches; but it doesn\u0027t cost anything to keep a watch.\" \"That\u0027s true; but I hope you\u0027ll be able to keep the horse.\" [75] \"So do I,\" said John; but he had very little expectation of it. \"Well, there\u0027s hope ahead, old fellow,\" said Sam, cheerfully. \"Next year we\u0027ll enter college, and then you\u0027ll be out of the way of Master Ben and your kind stepmother, for forty weeks in the year, at any rate.\" \"I hope so,\" said John, slowly. \"You hope so?\" repeated Sam. \"You don\u0027t expect Mrs. Oakley will remove to Cambridge, so that you may still be favored with her charming company?\" \"I don\u0027t feel sure of going to Cambridge myself,\" said John, soberly. \"You don\u0027t mean to say you\u0027re afraid you won\u0027t pass the examination? If you don\u0027t, there\u0027ll be precious little chance for the rest of us.\" \"That isn\u0027t what I mean,\" said John. \"I think I should pass the examination. At any rate I am not afraid of it.\" \"What are you afraid of then?\" asked Sam, in surprise. \"I am afraid Mrs. Oakley won\u0027t let me go.\" \"But your father always meant you to go. She knows that.\" \"Yes, she knows it, for father used often to refer[76] to the time when I would be in college, in her presence. But I am afraid that won\u0027t make much difference with her.\" \"Has she said anything about it?\" \"No, not yet; but it will cost considerable to keep me at Cambridge.\" \"Well, your father left a good deal of property.\" \"Yes; but it was left to Mrs. Oakley.\" \"There\u0027s enough to pay your expenses at college, and maintain Mrs. Oakley and Ben handsomely.\" \"I know that, but I am sorry to say that Mrs. Oakley and Ben both dislike me, and it will be reason enough with them to keep me at home because they know I am anxious to go.\" \"It\u0027s a burning shame,\" said Sam, indignantly, \"that such a woman as that should have the control over you. As for Ben Brayton, I always did despise him. He\u0027s a mean fellow, and a coward to boot.\" \"I don\u0027t like Ben much,\" said John. \"And he returns the compliment.\" \"Yes, he has taken a dislike to me, I don\u0027t know why, for I have always treated him well, though I couldn\u0027t like him.\" \"I say, John,\" said Sam, \"if you don\u0027t go to college, it\u0027ll knock all my plans into a cocked hat. You were to room with me, you know.\" [77] \"Yes, Sam, I have been looking forward to that a long time.\" \"What a jolly time we should have! I shan\u0027t have half so much pleasure in going to college if you don\u0027t go with me. You\u0027re such a good scholar, too, it would be a great pity. But perhaps it may not be so bad as you think. Mrs. Oakley may be only too glad to get rid of you.\" By this time they had reached the door of the academy. The bell sounded, summoning the pupils to their morning exercises, and John and Sam had other things to think of, for a while at least. At the close of the afternoon John returned home. He went into the house to carry his Virgil and Greek Reader, being accustomed to prepare a part of his lessons out of school. On going out into the yard, he saw Ben lounging lazily against a fence, whittling. \"Are you going out to ride, John?\" he asked, in an unusually friendly tone. \"I think I will ride a little way,\" said John. \"I got enough of it yesterday,\" said Ben. \"You were unlucky. If you had not struck Prince it would have been all right.\" \"I don\u0027t care about trying it again. I hope you\u0027ll have a pleasant ride.\" \"Thank you,\" said John, unsuspiciously. [78] He went out to the barn, and opened the door that led to the stables. He made his way at once to Prince\u0027s stall, and looked in. It was empty! Surprised, but not yet suspecting what had really happened, he called out to Mike, whom he saw outside:— \"Where\u0027s Prince, Mike?\" \"Shure, sir, didn\u0027t you know he was sold?\" \"Sold? When?\" \"This morning, Master John.\" \"Who bought him?\" \"Mr. Barnes, the man that keeps the livery stable. He was here this morning. He and the mistress came in, and they soon struck a bargain.\" John\u0027s heart swelled with anger and sorrow, but he asked, calmly:— \"Do you know what price Mr. Barnes gave for Prince?\" \"Yes, Master John; I heard him say that he would give one hundred and ninety dollars. The mistress wanted two hundred; but she finally let him have Prince at that, and a good bargain it is to him too.\" John left the stable outwardly calm, but much disturbed in mind. \"Mrs. Oakley might at least have let me know[79] what she meant to do,\" he said, bitterly. \"My poor father\u0027s gift too.\" Ben waited for John\u0027s return with malicious interest. He wanted to witness and enjoy his disappointment. \"I thought you were going to ride?\" he said, with a smile of mockery. \"Can you tell me where your mother is?\" asked John, coldly. \"She\u0027s in the house, I suppose. Do you want to see her?\" \"Yes.\" John entered the house without taking any further notice of Ben. He found his stepmother in the sitting-room. She looked up, as he entered, with a glance of satisfaction, for she saw that she had made him unhappy. \"Mike tells me you have sold Prince, Mrs. Oakley,\" he commenced. \"Yes. What of it?\" \"As he was my horse, I think you might have let me know what you intended to do.\" \"Prince was not your horse,\" she said, sharply. \"He was my poor father\u0027s gift to me.\" \"Nonsense! He merely let you call him yours. The horse was mine.\" [80] \"He was as much mine as Ben\u0027s watch is his. Are you going to sell Ben\u0027s watch?\" \"No, I am not. If that is all you have to say, you may leave the room.\" \"It is not. I will not object to your selling the horse, because it would cost something to keep him; but it is only fair that the money for which he was sold should be given to me, or enough to buy a watch and chain like Ben\u0027s.\" \"You are very modest in your expectations, young man,\" sneered Mrs. Oakley. \"I\u0027m only asking what is just.\" \"You seem to forget whom you are speaking to. If you think you can bully me, you will find yourself entirely mistaken.\" \"I am not in the habit of bullying anybody. I only want my rights,\" said John. \"Then you\u0027ll have to want. You may as well understand, first as last, John Oakley,\"—and his stepmother raised her voice angrily,—\"that I am mistress in this house, and owner of this property. You are entirely dependent upon me for the bread you eat and the clothes you wear, and it will be prudent for you to treat me respectfully, if you want any favors. Do you understand that?\" \"I understand what you say, Mrs. Oakley,\" said[81] John, indignantly. \"You seem to have forgotten that every cent of this property belonged to my father, and would now be mine, if my father had not married you. You had better remember that, when you talk about my being dependent upon you, and favor Ben at my expense.\" Mrs. Oakley turned white with rage. \"What do you mean by your impertinence, you young rascal?\" she shrieked, rising to her feet, and glaring at John. \"I mean this,\" he exclaimed, thoroughly provoked, \"that I don\u0027t believe my father ever intended to leave you all his property. I believe there is another will somewhere, and I mean to find it.\" \"Leave the room!\" exclaimed Mrs. Oakley, in a voice almost inarticulate with rage. \"You\u0027ll repent those words, John Oakley. You\u0027re in my power, and I\u0027ll make you feel it.\" John left the room, his anger hot within him. When he reflected coolly upon what had passed, he did repent having spoken about the will. It might set Mrs. Oakley upon the track, and if she found it, he feared that she would have no scruples in destroying it, and then his last chance of obtaining his rights would be gone.
