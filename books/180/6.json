{"id":5512,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"6:1 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 你 若 为 朋 友 作 保 ， 替 外 人 击 掌 ， [kjv] My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, [bbe] My son, if you have made yourself responsible for your neighbour, or given your word for another, 6:2 [hgb] 你 就 被 口 中 的 话 语 缠 住 ， 被 嘴 里 的 言 语 捉 住 。 [kjv] Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. [bbe] You are taken as in a net by the words of your mouth, the sayings of your lips have overcome you. 6:3 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 你 既 落 在 朋 友 手 中 ， 就 当 这 样 行 ， 才 可 救 自 己 。 你 要 自 卑 ， 去 恳 求 你 的 朋 友 。 [kjv] Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. [bbe] Do this, my son, and make yourself free, because you have come into the power of your neighbour; go without waiting, and make a strong request to your neighbour. 6:4 [hgb] 不 要 容 你 的 眼 睛 睡 觉 ， 不 要 容 你 的 眼 皮 打 盹 。 [kjv] Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. [bbe] Give no sleep to your eyes, or rest to them; 6:5 [hgb] 要 救 自 己 ， 如 鹿 脱 离 猎 户 的 手 ， 如 鸟 脱 离 捕 鸟 人 的 手 。 [kjv] Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. [bbe] Make yourself free, like the roe from the hand of the archer, and the bird from him who puts a net for her. 6:6 [hgb] 懒 惰 人 哪 ， 你 去 察 看 蚂 蚁 的 动 作 ， 就 可 得 智 慧 。 [kjv] Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: [bbe] Go to the ant, you hater of work; give thought to her ways and be wise: 6:7 [hgb] 蚂 蚁 没 有 元 帅 ， 没 有 官 长 ， 没 有 君 王 ， [kjv] Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, [bbe] Having no chief, overseer, or ruler, 6:8 [hgb] 尚 且 在 夏 天 预 备 食 物 ， 在 收 割 时 聚 敛 粮 食 。 [kjv] Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. [bbe] She gets her meat in the summer, storing up food at the time of the grain-cutting. 6:9 [hgb] 懒 惰 人 哪 ， 你 要 睡 到 几 时 呢 ？ 你 何 时 睡 醒 呢 ？ [kjv] How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? [bbe] How long will you be sleeping, O hater of work? when will you get up from your sleep? 6:10 [hgb] 再 睡 片 时 ， 打 盹 片 时 ， 抱 着 手 躺 卧 片 时 ， [kjv] Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: [bbe] A little sleep, a little rest, a little folding of the hands in sleep: 6:11 [hgb] 你 的 贫 穷 就 必 如 强 盗 速 来 ， 你 的 缺 乏 仿 佛 拿 兵 器 的 人 来 到 。 [kjv] So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. [bbe] Then loss will come on you like an outlaw, and your need like an armed man 6:12 [hgb] 无 赖 的 恶 徒 ， 行 动 就 用 乖 僻 的 口 。 [kjv] A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. [bbe] A good-for-nothing man is an evil-doer; he goes on his way causing trouble with false words; 6:13 [hgb] 用 眼 传 神 ， 用 脚 示 意 ， 用 指 点 划 。 [kjv] He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; [bbe] Making signs with his eyes, rubbing with his feet, and giving news with his fingers; 6:14 [hgb] 心 中 乖 僻 ， 常 设 恶 谋 ， 布 散 分 争 。 [kjv] Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. [bbe] His mind is ever designing evil: he lets loose violent acts. 6:15 [hgb] 所 以 灾 难 必 忽 然 临 到 他 身 。 他 必 顷 刻 败 坏 无 法 可 治 。 [kjv] Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. [bbe] For this cause his downfall will be sudden; quickly he will be broken, and there will be no help for him. 6:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 所 恨 恶 的 有 六 样 ， 连 他 心 所 憎 恶 的 共 有 七 样 。 [kjv] These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: [bbe] Six things are hated by the Lord; seven things are disgusting to him: 6:17 [hgb] 就 是 高 傲 的 眼 ， 撒 谎 的 舌 ， 流 无 辜 人 血 的 手 ， [kjv] A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, [bbe] Eyes of pride, a false tongue, hands which take life without cause; 6:18 [hgb] 图 谋 恶 计 的 心 ， 飞 跑 行 恶 的 脚 ， [kjv] An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, [bbe] A heart full of evil designs, feet which are quick in running after sin; 6:19 [hgb] 吐 谎 言 的 假 见 证 ， 并 弟 兄 中 布 散 分 争 的 人 。 [kjv] A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. [bbe] A false witness, breathing out untrue words, and one who lets loose violent acts among brothers. 6:20 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 要 谨 守 你 父 亲 的 诫 命 ， 不 可 离 弃 你 母 亲 的 法 则 。 （ 或 作 指 教 ） [kjv] My son, keep thy father\u0027s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: [bbe] My son, keep the rule of your father, and have in memory the teaching of your mother: 6:21 [hgb] 要 常 系 在 你 心 上 ， 挂 在 你 项 上 。 [kjv] Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. [bbe] Keep them ever folded in your heart, and have them hanging round your neck. 6:22 [hgb] 你 行 走 ， 他 必 引 导 你 。 你 躺 卧 ， 他 必 保 守 你 。 你 睡 醒 ， 他 必 与 你 谈 论 。 [kjv] When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. [bbe] In your walking, it will be your guide; when you are sleeping, it will keep watch over you; when you are awake, it will have talk with you. 6:23 [hgb] 因 为 诫 命 是 灯 ， 法 则 （ 或 作 指 教 ） 是 光 。 训 诲 的 责 备 是 生 命 的 道 。 [kjv] For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: [bbe] For the rule is a light, and the teaching a shining light; and the guiding words of training are the way of life. 6:24 [hgb] 能 保 你 远 离 恶 妇 ， 远 离 外 女 谄 媚 的 舌 头 。 [kjv] To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. [bbe] They will keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the strange woman. 6:25 [hgb] 你 心 中 不 要 恋 慕 她 的 美 色 ， 也 不 要 被 她 眼 皮 勾 引 。 [kjv] Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. [bbe] Let not your heart\u0027s desire go after her fair body; let not her eyes take you prisoner. 6:26 [hgb] 因 为 妓 女 能 使 人 只 剩 一 块 饼 ， 淫 妇 猎 取 人 宝 贵 的 生 命 。 [kjv] For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. [bbe] For a loose woman is looking for a cake of bread, but another man\u0027s wife goes after one\u0027s very life. 6:27 [hgb] 人 若 怀 里 搋 火 ， 衣 服 岂 能 不 烧 呢 ？ [kjv] Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? [bbe] May a man take fire to his breast without burning his clothing? 6:28 [hgb] 人 若 在 火 炭 上 走 ， 脚 岂 能 不 烫 呢 ？ [kjv] Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? [bbe] Or may one go on lighted coals, and his feet not be burned? 6:29 [hgb] 亲 近 邻 舍 之 妻 的 ， 也 是 如 此 。 凡 挨 近 她 的 ， 不 免 受 罚 。 [kjv] So he that goeth in to his neighbour\u0027s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. [bbe] So it is with him who goes in to his neighbour\u0027s wife; he who has anything to do with her will not go free from punishment. 6:30 [hgb] 贼 因 饥 饿 偷 窃 充 饥 ， 人 不 藐 视 他 。 [kjv] Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; [bbe] Men do not have a low opinion of a thief who takes food when he is in need of it: 6:31 [hgb] 若 被 找 着 ， 他 必 赔 还 七 倍 。 必 将 家 中 所 有 的 ， 尽 都 偿 还 。 [kjv] But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. [bbe] But if he is taken in the act he will have to give back seven times as much, giving up all his property which is in his house. 6:32 [hgb] 与 妇 人 行 淫 的 ， 便 是 无 知 ， 行 这 事 的 ， 必 丧 掉 生 命 。 [kjv] But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. [bbe] He who takes another man\u0027s wife is without all sense: he who does it is the cause of destruction to his soul. 6:33 [hgb] 他 必 受 伤 损 ， 必 被 凌 辱 。 他 的 羞 耻 不 得 涂 抹 。 [kjv] A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. [bbe] Wounds will be his and loss of honour, and his shame may not be washed away. 6:34 [hgb] 因 为 人 的 嫉 恨 ， 成 了 烈 怒 。 报 仇 的 时 候 ， 决 不 留 情 。 [kjv] For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. [bbe] For bitter is the wrath of an angry husband; in the day of punishment he will have no mercy. 6:35 [hgb] 什 么 赎 价 ， 他 都 不 顾 。 你 虽 送 许 多 礼 物 ， 他 也 不 肯 干 休 。 [kjv] He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. [bbe] He will not take any payment; and he will not make peace with you though your money offerings are increased.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1812.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
