{"id":5507,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel. 1:2 [hgb] 要 使 人 晓 得 智 慧 和 训 诲 。 分 辨 通 达 的 言 语 。 [kjv] To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; [bbe] To have knowledge of wise teaching; to be clear about the words of reason: 1:3 [hgb] 使 人 处 事 ， 领 受 智 慧 ， 仁 义 ， 公 平 ， 正 直 的 训 诲 。 [kjv] To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; [bbe] To be trained in the ways of wisdom, in righteousness and judging truly and straight behaviour: 1:4 [hgb] 使 愚 人 灵 明 ， 使 少 年 人 有 知 识 和 谋 略 。 [kjv] To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. [bbe] To make the simple-minded sharp, and to give the young man knowledge, and serious purpose: 1:5 [hgb] 使 智 慧 人 听 见 ， 增 长 学 问 。 使 聪 明 人 得 着 智 谋 。 [kjv] A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: [bbe] (The wise man, hearing, will get greater learning, and the acts of the man of good sense will be wisely guided:) 1:6 [hgb] 使 人 明 白 箴 言 和 譬 喻 ， 懂 得 智 慧 人 的 言 词 和 谜 语 。 [kjv] To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. [bbe] To get the sense of wise sayings and secrets, and of the words of the wise and their dark sayings. 1:7 [hgb] 敬 畏 耶 和 华 是 知 识 的 开 端 。 愚 妄 人 藐 视 智 慧 和 训 诲 。 [kjv] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. [bbe] The fear of the Lord is the start of knowledge: but the foolish have no use for wisdom and teaching. 1:8 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 要 听 你 父 亲 的 训 诲 ， 不 可 离 弃 你 母 亲 的 法 则 。 （ 或 作 指 教 ） [kjv] My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: [bbe] My son, give ear to the training of your father, and do not give up the teaching of your mother: 1:9 [hgb] 因 为 这 要 作 你 头 上 的 华 冠 ， 你 项 上 的 金 链 。 [kjv] For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. [bbe] For they will be a crown of grace for your head, and chain-ornaments about your neck. 1:10 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 恶 人 若 引 诱 你 ， 你 不 可 随 从 。 [kjv] My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. [bbe] My son, if sinners would take you out of the right way, do not go with them. 1:11 [hgb] 他 们 若 说 ， 你 与 我 们 同 去 ， 我 们 要 埋 伏 流 人 之 血 ， 要 蹲 伏 害 无 罪 之 人 。 [kjv] If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: [bbe] If they say, Come with us; let us make designs against the good, waiting secretly for the upright, without cause; 1:12 [hgb] 我 们 好 像 阴 间 ， 把 他 们 活 活 吞 下 。 他 们 如 同 下 坑 的 人 ， 被 我 们 囫 囵 吞 了 。 [kjv] Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: [bbe] Let us overcome them living, like the underworld, and in their strength, as those who go down to death; 1:13 [hgb] 我 们 必 得 各 样 宝 物 ， 将 所 掳 来 的 装 满 房 屋 。 [kjv] We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: [bbe] Goods of great price will be ours, our houses will be full of wealth; 1:14 [hgb] 你 与 我 们 大 家 同 分 。 我 们 共 用 一 个 囊 袋 。 [kjv] Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: [bbe] Take your chance with us, and we will all have one money-bag: 1:15 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 不 要 与 他 们 同 行 一 道 。 禁 止 你 脚 走 他 们 的 路 。 [kjv] My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: [bbe] My son, do not go with them; keep your feet from their ways: 1:16 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 的 脚 奔 跑 行 恶 ， 他 们 急 速 流 人 的 血 。 [kjv] For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. [bbe] For their feet are running after evil, and they are quick to take a man\u0027s life. 1:17 [hgb] 好 像 飞 鸟 ， 网 罗 设 在 眼 前 仍 不 躲 避 。 [kjv] Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. [bbe] Truly, to no purpose is the net stretched out before the eyes of the bird: 1:18 [hgb] 这 些 人 埋 伏 ， 是 为 自 流 己 血 。 蹲 伏 是 为 自 害 己 命 。 [kjv] And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. [bbe] And they are secretly waiting for their blood and making ready destruction for themselves. 1:19 [hgb] 凡 贪 恋 财 利 的 ， 所 行 之 路 ， 都 是 如 此 。 这 贪 恋 之 心 ， 乃 夺 去 得 财 者 之 命 。 [kjv] So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. [bbe] Such is the fate of everyone who goes in search of profit; it takes away the life of its owners. 1:20 [hgb] 智 慧 在 街 市 上 呼 喊 ， 在 宽 阔 处 发 声 。 [kjv] Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: [bbe] Wisdom is crying out in the street; her voice is loud in the open places; 1:21 [hgb] 在 热 闹 街 头 喊 叫 ， 在 城 门 口 ， 在 城 中 发 出 言 语 。 [kjv] She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, [bbe] Her words are sounding in the meeting-places, and in the doorways of the town: 1:22 [hgb] 说 你 们 愚 昧 人 喜 爱 愚 昧 ， 亵 慢 人 喜 欢 亵 慢 ， 愚 顽 人 恨 恶 知 识 ， 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ [kjv] How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? [bbe] How long, you simple ones, will foolish things be dear to you? and pride a delight to the haters of authority? how long will the foolish go on hating knowledge? 1:23 [hgb] 你 们 当 因 我 的 责 备 回 转 。 我 要 将 我 的 灵 浇 灌 你 们 ， 将 我 的 话 指 示 你 们 。 [kjv] Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. [bbe] Be turned again by my sharp words: see, I will send the flow of my spirit on you, and make my words clear to you. 1:24 [hgb] 我 呼 唤 你 们 不 肯 听 从 。 我 伸 手 ， 无 人 理 会 。 [kjv] Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; [bbe] Because your ears were shut to my voice; no one gave attention to my out-stretched hand; 1:25 [hgb] 反 轻 弃 我 一 切 的 劝 戒 ， 不 肯 受 我 的 责 备 。 [kjv] But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: [bbe] You were not controlled by my guiding, and would have nothing to do with my sharp words: 1:26 [hgb] 你 们 遭 灾 难 ， 我 就 发 笑 惊 恐 临 到 你 们 ， 我 必 嗤 笑 。 [kjv] I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; [bbe] So in the day of your trouble I will be laughing; I will make sport of your fear; 1:27 [hgb] 惊 恐 临 到 你 们 ， 好 像 狂 风 ， 灾 难 来 到 ， 如 同 暴 风 。 急 难 痛 苦 临 到 你 们 身 上 。 [kjv] When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. [bbe] When your fear comes on you like a storm, and your trouble like a rushing wind; when pain and sorrow come on you. 1:28 [hgb] 那 时 ， 你 们 必 呼 求 我 ， 我 却 不 答 应 ， 恳 切 的 寻 找 我 ， 却 寻 不 见 。 [kjv] Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: [bbe] Then I will give no answer to their cries; searching for me early, they will not see me: 1:29 [hgb] 因 为 你 们 恨 恶 知 识 ， 不 喜 爱 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， [kjv] For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: [bbe] For they were haters of knowledge, and did not give their hearts to the fear of the Lord: 1:30 [hgb] 不 听 我 的 劝 戒 ， 藐 视 我 一 切 的 责 备 ， [kjv] They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. [bbe] They had no desire for my teaching, and my words of protest were as nothing to them. 1:31 [hgb] 所 以 必 吃 自 结 的 果 子 ， 充 满 自 设 的 计 谋 。 [kjv] Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. [bbe] So the fruit of their way will be their food, and with the designs of their hearts they will be made full. 1:32 [hgb] 愚 昧 人 背 道 ， 必 杀 己 身 ， 愚 顽 人 安 逸 ， 必 害 己 命 。 [kjv] For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. [bbe] For the turning back of the simple from teaching will be the cause of their death, and the peace of the foolish will be their destruction. 1:33 [hgb] 惟 有 听 从 我 的 ， 必 安 然 居 住 ， 得 享 安 静 ， 不 怕 灾 祸 。 [kjv] But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. [bbe] But whoever gives ear to me will take his rest safely, living in peace without fear of evil.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1807.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
