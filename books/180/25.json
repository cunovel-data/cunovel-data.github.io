{"id":5531,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"25:1 [hgb] 以 下 也 是 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 是 犹 大 王 希 西 家 的 人 所 誊 录 的 。 \n [kjv] These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. \n [bbe] These are more wise sayings of Solomon, copied out by the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah. \n 25:2 [hgb] 将 事 隐 秘 ， 乃 神 的 荣 耀 。 将 事 察 清 ， 乃 君 王 的 荣 耀 。 \n [kjv] It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. \n [bbe] It is the glory of God to keep a thing secret: but the glory of kings is to have it searched out. \n 25:3 [hgb] 天 之 高 ， 地 之 厚 ， 君 王 之 心 也 测 不 透 。 \n [kjv] The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. \n [bbe] The heaven is high and the earth is deep, and the hearts of kings may not be searched out. \n 25:4 [hgb] 除 去 银 子 的 渣 滓 ， 就 有 银 子 出 来 ， 银 匠 能 以 作 器 皿 。 \n [kjv] Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. \n [bbe] Take away the waste from silver, and a vessel will come out for the silver-worker. \n 25:5 [hgb] 除 去 王 面 前 的 恶 人 ， 国 位 就 靠 公 义 坚 立 。 \n [kjv] Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. \n [bbe] Take away evil-doers from before the king, and the seat of his power will be made strong in righteousness. \n 25:6 [hgb] 不 要 在 王 面 前 妄 自 尊 大 。 不 要 在 大 人 的 位 上 站 立 。 \n [kjv] Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: \n [bbe] Do not take glory for yourself before the king, and do not put yourself in the place of the great: \n 25:7 [hgb] 宁 可 有 人 说 ， 请 你 上 来 ， 强 如 在 你 觐 见 的 王 子 面 前 ， 叫 你 退 下 。 \n [kjv] For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. \n [bbe] For it is better to have it said to you, Come up here; than for you to be put down in a lower place before the ruler. \n 25:8 [hgb] 不 要 冒 失 出 去 与 人 争 竞 ， 免 得 至 终 被 他 羞 辱 ， 你 就 不 知 道 怎 样 行 了 。 \n [kjv] Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. \n [bbe] Do not be quick to go to law about what you have seen, for what will you do in the end, when your neighbour has put you to shame? \n 25:9 [hgb] 你 与 邻 舍 争 讼 ， 要 与 他 一 人 辩 论 。 不 可 泄 漏 人 的 密 事 。 \n [kjv] Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another: \n [bbe] Have a talk with your neighbour himself about your cause, but do not give away the secret of another: \n 25:10 [hgb] 恐 怕 听 见 的 人 骂 你 ， 你 的 臭 名 就 难 以 脱 离 。 \n [kjv] Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. \n [bbe] Or your hearer may say evil of you, and your shame will not be turned away. \n 25:11 [hgb] 一 句 话 说 得 合 宜 ， 就 如 金 苹 果 在 银 网 子 里 。 \n [kjv] A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. \n [bbe] A word at the right time is like apples of gold in a network of silver. \n 25:12 [hgb] 智 慧 人 的 劝 戒 ， 在 顺 从 的 人 耳 中 ， 好 像 金 耳 环 ， 和 精 金 的 妆 饰 。 \n [kjv] As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. \n [bbe] Like a nose-ring of gold and an ornament of the best gold, is a wise man who says sharp words to an ear ready to give attention. \n 25:13 [hgb] 忠 信 的 使 者 ， 叫 差 他 的 人 心 里 舒 畅 ， 就 如 在 收 割 时 ， 有 冰 雪 的 凉 气 。 \n [kjv] As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. \n [bbe] As the cold of snow in the time of grain-cutting, so is a true servant to those who send him; for he gives new life to the soul of his master. \n 25:14 [hgb] 空 夸 赠 送 礼 物 的 ， 好 像 无 雨 的 风 云 。 \n [kjv] Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. \n [bbe] As clouds and wind without rain, so is one who takes credit for an offering he has not given. \n 25:15 [hgb] 恒 常 忍 耐 ， 可 以 劝 动 君 王 。 柔 和 的 舌 头 ， 能 折 断 骨 头 。 \n [kjv] By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. \n [bbe] A judge is moved by one who for a long time undergoes wrongs without protest, and by a soft tongue even bone is broken. \n 25:16 [hgb] 你 得 了 蜜 吗 ？ 只 可 吃 够 而 已 。 恐 怕 你 过 饱 就 呕 吐 出 来 。 \n [kjv] Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. \n [bbe] If you have honey, take only as much as is enough for you; for fear that, being full of it, you may not be able to keep it down. \n 25:17 [hgb] 你 的 脚 要 少 进 邻 舍 的 家 ， 恐 怕 他 厌 烦 你 ， 恨 恶 你 。 \n [kjv] Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour\u0027s house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. \n [bbe] Let not your foot be frequently in your neighbour\u0027s house, or he may get tired of you, and his feeling be turned to hate. \n 25:18 [hgb] 作 假 见 证 陷 害 邻 舍 的 ， 就 是 大 槌 ， 是 利 刀 ， 是 快 箭 。 \n [kjv] A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. \n [bbe] One who gives false witness against his neighbour is a hammer and a sword and a sharp arrow. \n 25:19 [hgb] 患 难 时 倚 靠 不 忠 诚 的 人 ， 好 像 破 坏 的 牙 ， 错 骨 缝 的 脚 。 \n [kjv] Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. \n [bbe] Putting one\u0027s faith in a false man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth and a shaking foot. \n 25:20 [hgb] 对 伤 心 的 人 唱 歌 ， 就 如 冷 天 脱 衣 服 ， 又 如 碱 上 倒 醋 。 \n [kjv] As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. \n [bbe] Like one who takes off clothing in cold weather and like acid on a wound, is he who makes melody to a sad heart. \n 25:21 [hgb] 你 的 仇 敌 ， 若 饿 了 就 给 他 饭 吃 。 若 渴 了 就 给 他 水 喝 。 \n [kjv] If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: \n [bbe] If your hater is in need of food, give him bread; and if he is in need of drink, give him water: \n 25:22 [hgb] 因 为 你 这 样 行 ， 就 是 把 炭 火 堆 在 他 的 头 上 。 耶 和 华 也 必 赏 赐 你 。 \n [kjv] For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. \n [bbe] For so you will put coals of fire on his head, and the Lord will give you your reward. \n 25:23 [hgb] 北 风 生 雨 ， 谗 谤 人 的 舌 头 也 生 怒 容 。 \n [kjv] The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. \n [bbe] As the north wind gives birth to rain, so is an angry face caused by a tongue saying evil secretly. \n 25:24 [hgb] 宁 可 住 在 房 顶 的 角 上 ， 不 在 宽 阔 的 房 屋 与 争 吵 的 妇 人 同 住 。 \n [kjv] It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. \n [bbe] It is better to be living in an angle of the house-top, than with a bitter-tongued woman in a wide house. \n 25:25 [hgb] 有 好 消 息 从 远 方 来 ， 就 如 拿 凉 水 给 口 渴 的 人 喝 。 \n [kjv] As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. \n [bbe] As cold water to a tired soul, so is good news from a far country. \n 25:26 [hgb] 义 人 在 恶 人 面 前 退 缩 ， 好 像 ？ ？ 浑 之 泉 ， 弄 浊 之 井 。 \n [kjv] A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. \n [bbe] Like a troubled fountain and a dirty spring, is an upright man who has to give way before evil-doers. \n 25:27 [hgb] 吃 蜜 过 多 ， 是 不 好 的 。 考 究 自 己 的 荣 耀 ， 也 是 可 厌 的 。 \n [kjv] It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory. \n [bbe] It is not good to take much honey: so he who is not looking for honour will be honoured. \n 25:28 [hgb] 人 不 制 伏 自 己 的 心 ， 好 像 毁 坏 的 城 邑 ， 没 有 墙 垣 。 \n [kjv] He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls. \n [bbe] He whose spirit is uncontrolled is like an unwalled town which has been broken into. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1831.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
