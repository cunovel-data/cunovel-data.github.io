{"id":5526,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"20:1 [hgb] 酒 能 使 人 亵 慢 ， 浓 酒 使 人 喧 嚷 。 凡 因 酒 错 误 的 ， 就 无 智 慧 。 \n [kjv] Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. \n [bbe] Wine makes men foolish, and strong drink makes men come to blows; and whoever comes into error through these is not wise. \n 20:2 [hgb] 王 的 威 吓 ， 如 同 狮 子 吼 叫 。 惹 动 他 怒 的 ， 是 自 害 己 命 。 \n [kjv] The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul. \n [bbe] The wrath of a king is like the loud cry of a lion: he who makes him angry does wrong against himself. \n 20:3 [hgb] 远 离 分 争 ， 是 人 的 尊 荣 。 愚 妄 人 都 爱 争 闹 。 \n [kjv] It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling. \n [bbe] It is an honour for a man to keep from fighting, but the foolish are ever at war. \n 20:4 [hgb] 懒 惰 人 因 冬 寒 不 肯 耕 种 。 到 收 割 的 时 候 ， 他 必 讨 饭 ， 而 无 所 得 。 \n [kjv] The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing. \n [bbe] The hater of work will not do his ploughing because of the winter; so at the time of grain-cutting he will be requesting food and will get nothing. \n 20:5 [hgb] 人 心 怀 藏 谋 略 ， 好 像 深 水 。 惟 明 哲 人 ， 才 能 汲 引 出 来 。 \n [kjv] Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. \n [bbe] The purpose in the heart of a man is like deep water, but a man of good sense will get it out. \n 20:6 [hgb] 人 多 述 说 自 己 的 仁 慈 。 但 忠 信 人 谁 能 遇 着 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? \n [bbe] Most men make no secret of their kind acts: but where is a man of good faith to be seen? \n 20:7 [hgb] 行 为 纯 正 的 义 人 ， 他 的 子 孙 ， 是 有 福 的 。 \n [kjv] The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him. \n [bbe] An upright man goes on in his righteousness: happy are his children after him! \n 20:8 [hgb] 王 坐 在 审 判 的 位 上 ， 以 眼 目 驱 散 诸 恶 。 \n [kjv] A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. \n [bbe] A king on the seat of judging puts to flight all evil with his eyes. \n 20:9 [hgb] 谁 能 说 ， 我 洁 净 了 我 的 心 。 我 脱 净 了 我 的 罪 。 \n [kjv] Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? \n [bbe] Who is able to say, I have made my heart clean, I am free from my sin? \n 20:10 [hgb] 两 样 的 法 码 ， 两 样 的 升 斗 ， 都 为 耶 和 华 所 憎 恶 。 \n [kjv] Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD. \n [bbe] Unequal weights and unequal measures, they are all disgusting to the Lord. \n 20:11 [hgb] 孩 童 的 动 作 ， 是 清 洁 ， 是 正 直 ， 都 显 明 他 的 本 性 。 \n [kjv] Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. \n [bbe] Even a child may be judged by his doings, if his work is free from sin and if it is right. \n 20:12 [hgb] 能 听 的 耳 ， 能 看 的 眼 ， 都 是 耶 和 华 所 造 的 。 \n [kjv] The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them. \n [bbe] The hearing ear and the seeing eye are equally the Lord\u0027s work. \n 20:13 [hgb] 不 要 贪 睡 ， 免 致 贫 穷 。 眼 要 睁 开 ， 你 就 吃 饱 。 \n [kjv] Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. \n [bbe] Do not be a lover of sleep, or you will become poor: keep your eyes open, and you will have bread enough. \n 20:14 [hgb] 买 物 的 说 ， 不 好 ， 不 好 。 及 至 买 去 ， 他 便 自 夸 。 \n [kjv] It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. \n [bbe] A poor thing, a poor thing, says he who is giving money for goods: but when he has gone on his way, then he makes clear his pride in what he has got. \n 20:15 [hgb] 有 金 子 ， 和 许 多 珍 珠 。 （ 或 作 红 宝 石 ） 惟 有 知 识 的 嘴 ， 乃 为 贵 重 的 珍 宝 。 \n [kjv] There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. \n [bbe] There is gold and a store of corals: but the lips of knowledge are a jewel of great price. \n 20:16 [hgb] 谁 为 生 人 作 保 ， 就 拿 谁 的 衣 服 。 谁 为 外 人 作 保 ， 谁 就 要 承 当 。 \n [kjv] Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. \n [bbe] Take a man\u0027s clothing if he makes himself responsible for a strange man, and get an undertaking from him who gives his word for strange men. \n 20:17 [hgb] 以 虚 谎 而 得 的 食 物 ， 人 觉 甘 甜 。 但 后 来 他 的 口 ， 必 充 满 尘 沙 。 \n [kjv] Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. \n [bbe] Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but after, his mouth will be full of sand. \n 20:18 [hgb] 计 谋 都 凭 筹 算 立 定 。 打 仗 要 凭 智 谋 。 \n [kjv] Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war. \n [bbe] Every purpose is put into effect by wise help: and by wise guiding make war. \n 20:19 [hgb] 往 来 传 舌 的 ， 泄 漏 密 事 。 大 张 嘴 的 不 可 与 他 结 交 。 \n [kjv] He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. \n [bbe] He who goes about talking of the business of others gives away secrets: so have nothing to do with him whose lips are open wide. \n 20:20 [hgb] 咒 骂 父 母 的 ， 他 的 灯 必 灭 ， 变 为 漆 黑 的 黑 暗 。 \n [kjv] Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. \n [bbe] If anyone puts a curse on his father or his mother, his light will be put out in the blackest night. \n 20:21 [hgb] 起 初 速 得 的 产 业 ， 终 久 却 不 为 福 。 \n [kjv] An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed. \n [bbe] A heritage may be got quickly at first, but the end of it will not be a blessing. \n 20:22 [hgb] 你 不 要 说 ， 我 要 以 恶 报 恶 。 要 等 候 耶 和 华 ， 他 必 拯 救 你 。 \n [kjv] Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee. \n [bbe] Do not say, I will give punishment for evil: go on waiting for the Lord, and he will be your saviour. \n 20:23 [hgb] 两 样 的 法 码 ， 为 耶 和 华 所 憎 恶 。 诡 诈 的 天 平 ， 也 为 不 善 。 \n [kjv] Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good. \n [bbe] Unequal weights are disgusting to the Lord, and false scales are not good. \n 20:24 [hgb] 人 的 脚 步 ， 为 耶 和 华 所 定 。 人 岂 能 明 白 自 己 的 路 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Man\u0027s goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? \n [bbe] A man\u0027s steps are of the Lord; how then may a man have knowledge of his way? \n 20:25 [hgb] 人 冒 失 说 ， 这 是 圣 物 ， 许 愿 之 后 才 查 问 ， 就 是 自 陷 网 罗 。 \n [kjv] It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry. \n [bbe] It is a danger to a man to say without thought, It is holy, and, after taking his oaths, to be questioning if it is necessary to keep them. \n 20:26 [hgb] 智 慧 的 王 ， 簸 散 恶 人 ， 用 碌 碡 滚 轧 他 们 。 \n [kjv] A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them. \n [bbe] A wise king puts evil-doers to flight, and makes their evil-doing come back on them. \n 20:27 [hgb] 人 的 灵 是 耶 和 华 的 灯 ， 鉴 察 人 的 心 腹 。 \n [kjv] The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly. \n [bbe] The Lord keeps watch over the spirit of man, searching all the deepest parts of the body. \n 20:28 [hgb] 王 因 仁 慈 和 诚 实 ， 得 以 保 全 他 的 国 位 ， 也 因 仁 慈 立 稳 。 \n [kjv] Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. \n [bbe] Mercy and good faith keep the king safe, and the seat of his power is based on upright acts. \n 20:29 [hgb] 强 壮 乃 少 年 人 的 荣 耀 。 白 发 为 老 年 人 的 尊 荣 。 \n [kjv] The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head. \n [bbe] The glory of young men is their strength, and the honour of old men is their grey hairs. \n 20:30 [hgb] 鞭 伤 除 净 人 的 罪 恶 。 责 打 能 入 人 的 心 腹 。 \n [kjv] The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly. \n [bbe] By the wounds of the rod evil is taken away, and blows make clean the deepest parts of the body. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1826.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
