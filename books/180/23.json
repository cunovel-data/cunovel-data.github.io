{"id":5529,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 23","content":"23:1 [hgb] 你 若 与 官 长 坐 席 ， 要 留 意 在 你 面 前 的 是 谁 。 [kjv] When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee: [bbe] When you take your seat at the feast with a ruler, give thought with care to what is before you; 23:2 [hgb] 你 若 是 贪 食 的 ， 就 当 拿 刀 放 在 喉 咙 上 。 [kjv] And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. [bbe] And put a knife to your throat, if you have a strong desire for food. 23:3 [hgb] 不 可 贪 恋 他 的 美 食 ， 因 为 是 哄 人 的 食 物 。 [kjv] Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat. [bbe] Have no desire for his delicate food, for it is the bread of deceit. 23:4 [hgb] 不 要 劳 碌 求 富 。 休 仗 自 己 的 聪 明 。 [kjv] Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. [bbe] Take no care to get wealth; let there be an end to your desire for money. 23:5 [hgb] 你 岂 要 定 睛 在 虚 无 的 钱 财 上 吗 ？ 因 钱 财 必 长 翅 膀 ， 如 鹰 向 天 飞 去 。 [kjv] Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. [bbe] Are your eyes lifted up to it? it is gone: for wealth takes to itself wings, like an eagle in flight up to heaven. 23:6 [hgb] 不 要 吃 恶 眼 人 的 饭 。 也 不 要 贪 他 的 美 味 。 [kjv] Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: [bbe] Do not take the food of him who has an evil eye, or have any desire for his delicate meat: 23:7 [hgb] 因 为 他 心 怎 样 思 量 ， 他 为 人 就 是 怎 样 。 他 虽 对 你 说 ， 请 吃 ， 请 喝 。 他 的 心 却 与 你 相 背 。 [kjv] For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee. [bbe] For as the thoughts of his heart are, so is he: Take food and drink, he says to you; but his heart is not with you. 23:8 [hgb] 你 所 吃 的 那 点 食 物 ， 必 吐 出 来 。 你 所 说 的 甘 美 言 语 ， 也 必 落 空 。 [kjv] The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words. [bbe] The food which you have taken will come up again, and your pleasing words will be wasted. 23:9 [hgb] 你 不 要 说 话 给 愚 昧 人 听 。 因 他 必 藐 视 你 智 慧 的 言 语 。 [kjv] Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. [bbe] Say nothing in the hearing of a foolish man, for he will put no value on the wisdom of your words. 23:10 [hgb] 不 可 挪 移 古 时 的 地 界 。 也 不 可 侵 入 孤 儿 的 田 地 。 [kjv] Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: [bbe] Do not let the landmark of the widow be moved, and do not go into the fields of those who have no father; 23:11 [hgb] 因 他 们 的 救 赎 主 ， 大 有 能 力 。 他 必 向 你 为 他 们 辨 屈 。 [kjv] For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee. [bbe] For their saviour is strong, and he will take up their cause against you. 23:12 [hgb] 你 要 留 心 领 受 训 诲 。 侧 耳 听 从 知 识 的 言 语 。 [kjv] Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge. [bbe] Give your heart to teaching, and your ears to the words of knowledge. 23:13 [hgb] 不 可 不 管 教 孩 童 ， 你 用 杖 打 他 ， 他 必 不 至 于 死 。 [kjv] Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. [bbe] Do not keep back training from the child: for even if you give him blows with the rod, it will not be death to him. 23:14 [hgb] 你 要 用 杖 打 他 ， 就 可 以 救 他 的 灵 魂 免 下 阴 间 。 [kjv] Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. [bbe] Give him blows with the rod, and keep his soul safe from the underworld. 23:15 [hgb] 我 儿 你 心 若 存 智 慧 ， 我 的 心 也 甚 欢 喜 。 [kjv] My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. [bbe] My son, if your heart becomes wise, I, even I, will be glad in heart; 23:16 [hgb] 你 的 嘴 若 说 正 直 话 ， 我 的 心 肠 也 必 快 乐 。 [kjv] Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. [bbe] And my thoughts in me will be full of joy when your lips say right things. 23:17 [hgb] 你 心 中 不 要 嫉 妒 罪 人 。 只 要 终 日 敬 畏 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long. [bbe] Have no envy of sinners in your heart, but keep in the fear of the Lord all through the day; 23:18 [hgb] 因 为 至 终 必 有 善 报 。 你 的 指 望 也 不 至 断 绝 。 [kjv] For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off. [bbe] For without doubt there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off. 23:19 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 你 当 听 ， 当 存 智 慧 ， 好 在 正 道 上 引 导 你 的 心 。 [kjv] Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. [bbe] Give ear, my son, and be wise, guiding your heart in the right way. 23:20 [hgb] 好 饮 酒 的 ， 好 吃 肉 的 ， 不 要 与 他 们 来 往 。 [kjv] Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: [bbe] Do not be among those who give themselves to wine-drinking, or among those who make themselves full with meat: 23:21 [hgb] 因 为 好 酒 贪 食 的 ， 必 致 贫 穷 。 好 睡 觉 的 ， 必 穿 破 烂 衣 服 。 [kjv] For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. [bbe] For those who take delight in drink and feasting will come to be in need; and through love of sleep a man will be poorly clothed. 23:22 [hgb] 你 要 听 从 生 你 的 父 亲 。 你 母 亲 老 了 ， 也 不 可 藐 视 她 。 [kjv] Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old. [bbe] Give ear to your father whose child you are, and do not keep honour from your mother when she is old. 23:23 [hgb] 你 当 买 真 理 。 就 是 智 慧 ， 训 诲 ， 和 聪 明 ， 也 都 不 可 卖 。 [kjv] Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. [bbe] Get for yourself that which is true, and do not let it go for money; get wisdom and teaching and good sense. 23:24 [hgb] 义 人 的 父 亲 ， 必 大 得 快 乐 。 人 生 智 慧 的 儿 子 ， 必 因 他 欢 喜 。 [kjv] The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. [bbe] The father of the upright man will be glad, and he who has a wise child will have joy because of him. 23:25 [hgb] 你 要 使 父 母 欢 喜 。 使 生 你 的 快 乐 。 [kjv] Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. [bbe] Let your father and your mother be glad, let her who gave you birth have joy. 23:26 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 要 将 你 的 心 归 我 。 你 的 眼 目 ， 也 要 喜 悦 我 的 道 路 。 [kjv] My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. [bbe] My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes take delight in my ways. 23:27 [hgb] 妓 女 是 深 坑 。 外 女 是 窄 阱 。 [kjv] For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit. [bbe] For a loose woman is a deep hollow, and a strange woman is a narrow water-hole. 23:28 [hgb] 她 埋 伏 好 像 强 盗 ， 她 使 人 中 多 有 奸 诈 的 。 [kjv] She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. [bbe] Yes, she is waiting secretly like a beast for its food, and deceit by her is increased among men. 23:29 [hgb] 谁 有 祸 患 ， 谁 有 忧 愁 ， 谁 有 争 斗 ， 谁 有 哀 叹 ， （ 或 作 怨 言 ） 谁 无 故 受 伤 ， 谁 眼 目 红 赤 。 [kjv] Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? [bbe] Who says, Oh! who says, Ah! who has violent arguments, who has grief, who has wounds without cause, whose eyes are dark? 23:30 [hgb] 就 是 那 流 连 饮 酒 ， 常 去 寻 找 调 和 酒 的 人 。 [kjv] They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. [bbe] Those who are seated late over the wine: those who go looking for mixed wine. 23:31 [hgb] 酒 发 红 ， 在 杯 中 闪 烁 ， 你 不 可 观 看 ， 虽 然 下 咽 舒 畅 ， 终 久 是 咬 你 如 蛇 ， 刺 你 如 毒 蛇 。 [kjv] Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. [bbe] Keep your eyes from looking on the wine when it is red, when its colour is bright in the cup, when it goes smoothly down: 23:32 [hgb] [kjv] At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. [bbe] In the end, its bite is like that of a snake, its wound like the wound of a poison-snake. 23:33 [hgb] 你 眼 必 看 见 异 怪 的 事 。 （ 异 怪 的 事 或 作 淫 妇 ） 你 心 必 发 出 乖 谬 的 话 。 [kjv] Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things. [bbe] Your eyes will see strange things, and you will say twisted things. 23:34 [hgb] 你 必 像 躺 在 海 中 ， 或 像 卧 在 桅 杆 上 。 [kjv] Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. [bbe] Yes, you will be like him who takes his rest on the sea, or on the top of a sail-support. 23:35 [hgb] 你 必 说 ， 人 打 我 ， 我 却 未 受 伤 ， 人 鞭 打 我 ， 我 竟 不 觉 得 ， 我 几 时 清 醒 ， 我 仍 去 寻 酒 。 [kjv] They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. [bbe] They have overcome me, you will say, and I have no pain; they gave me blows without my feeling them: when will I be awake from my wine? I will go after it again.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1829.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
