{"id":5514,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 智 慧 岂 不 呼 叫 ， 聪 明 岂 不 发 声 。 [kjv] Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? [bbe] Is not wisdom crying out, and the voice of knowledge sounding? 8:2 [hgb] 他 在 道 旁 高 处 的 顶 上 ， 在 十 字 路 口 站 立 。 [kjv] She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. [bbe] At the top of the highways, at the meeting of the roads, she takes her place; 8:3 [hgb] 在 城 门 旁 ， 在 城 门 口 ， 在 城 门 洞 ， 大 声 说 ， [kjv] She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. [bbe] Where the roads go into the town her cry goes out, at the doorways her voice is loud: 8:4 [hgb] 众 人 哪 ， 我 呼 叫 你 们 。 我 向 世 人 发 声 ， [kjv] Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. [bbe] I am crying out to you, O men; my voice comes to the sons of men. 8:5 [hgb] 说 ， 愚 蒙 人 哪 ， 你 们 要 会 悟 灵 明 。 愚 昧 人 哪 ， 你 们 当 心 里 明 白 。 [kjv] O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. [bbe] Become expert in reason, O you simple ones; you foolish ones, take training to heart. 8:6 [hgb] 你 们 当 听 ， 因 我 要 说 极 美 的 话 。 我 张 嘴 要 论 正 直 的 事 。 [kjv] Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. [bbe] Give ear, for my words are true, and my lips are open to give out what is upright. 8:7 [hgb] 我 的 口 要 发 出 真 理 。 我 的 嘴 憎 恶 邪 恶 。 [kjv] For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. [bbe] For good faith goes out of my mouth, and false lips are disgusting to me. 8:8 [hgb] 我 口 中 的 言 语 ， 都 是 公 义 ， 并 无 弯 曲 乖 僻 。 [kjv] All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. [bbe] All the words of my mouth are righteousness; there is nothing false or twisted in them. 8:9 [hgb] 有 聪 明 的 以 为 明 显 ， 得 知 识 的 以 为 正 直 。 [kjv] They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. [bbe] They are all true to him whose mind is awake, and straightforward to those who get knowledge. 8:10 [hgb] 你 们 当 受 我 的 教 训 ， 不 受 白 银 。 宁 得 知 识 ， 胜 过 黄 金 。 [kjv] Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. [bbe] Take my teaching, and not silver; get knowledge in place of the best gold. 8:11 [hgb] 因 为 智 慧 比 珍 珠 （ 或 作 红 宝 石 ） 更 美 。 一 切 可 喜 爱 的 ， 都 不 足 与 比 较 。 [kjv] For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. [bbe] For wisdom is better than jewels, and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her. 8:12 [hgb] 我 智 慧 以 灵 明 为 居 所 ， 又 寻 得 知 识 和 谋 略 。 [kjv] I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. [bbe] I, wisdom, have made wise behaviour my near relation; I am seen to be the special friend of wise purposes. 8:13 [hgb] 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 在 乎 恨 恶 邪 恶 。 那 骄 傲 ， 狂 妄 ， 并 恶 道 ， 以 及 乖 谬 的 口 ， 都 为 我 所 恨 恶 。 [kjv] The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. [bbe] The fear of the Lord is seen in hating evil: pride, a high opinion of oneself, the evil way, and the false tongue, are unpleasing to me. 8:14 [hgb] 我 有 谋 略 ， 和 真 知 识 。 我 乃 聪 明 。 我 有 能 力 。 [kjv] Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. [bbe] Wise design and good sense are mine; reason and strength are mine. 8:15 [hgb] 帝 王 借 我 坐 国 位 。 君 王 借 我 定 公 平 。 [kjv] By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. [bbe] Through me kings have their power, and rulers give right decisions. 8:16 [hgb] 王 子 和 首 领 ， 世 上 一 切 的 审 判 官 ， 都 是 借 我 掌 权 。 [kjv] By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. [bbe] Through me chiefs have authority, and the noble ones are judging in righteousness. 8:17 [hgb] 爱 我 的 ， 我 也 爱 他 。 恳 切 寻 求 我 的 ， 必 寻 得 见 。 [kjv] I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. [bbe] Those who have given me their love are loved by me, and those who make search for me with care will get me. 8:18 [hgb] 丰 富 尊 荣 在 我 。 恒 久 的 财 并 公 义 也 在 我 。 [kjv] Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. [bbe] Wealth and honour are in my hands, even wealth without equal and righteousness. 8:19 [hgb] 我 的 果 实 胜 过 黄 金 。 强 如 精 金 ， 我 的 出 产 超 乎 高 银 。 [kjv] My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. [bbe] My fruit is better than gold, even than the best gold; and my increase is more to be desired than silver. 8:20 [hgb] 我 在 公 义 的 道 上 走 ， 在 公 平 的 路 中 行 。 [kjv] I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: [bbe] I go in the road of righteousness, in the way of right judging: 8:21 [hgb] 使 爱 我 的 承 受 货 财 ， 并 充 满 他 们 的 府 库 。 [kjv] That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. [bbe] So that I may give my lovers wealth for their heritage, making their store-houses full. 8:22 [hgb] 在 耶 和 华 造 化 的 起 头 ， 在 太 初 创 造 万 物 之 先 ， 就 有 了 我 。 [kjv] The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. [bbe] The Lord made me as the start of his way, the first of his works in the past. 8:23 [hgb] 从 亘 古 ， 从 太 初 ， 未 有 世 界 以 前 ， 我 已 被 立 。 [kjv] I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. [bbe] From eternal days I was given my place, from the birth of time, before the earth was. 8:24 [hgb] 没 有 深 渊 ， 没 有 大 水 的 泉 源 ， 我 已 生 出 。 [kjv] When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. [bbe] When there was no deep I was given birth, when there were no fountains flowing with water. 8:25 [hgb] 大 山 未 曾 奠 定 ， 小 山 未 有 之 先 ， 我 已 生 出 。 [kjv] Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: [bbe] Before the mountains were put in their places, before the hills was my birth: 8:26 [hgb] 耶 和 华 还 没 有 创 造 大 地 ， 和 田 野 ， 并 世 上 的 土 质 ， 我 已 生 出 。 [kjv] While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. [bbe] When he had not made the earth or the fields or the dust of the world. 8:27 [hgb] 他 立 高 天 ， 我 在 那 里 。 他 在 渊 面 的 周 围 ， 划 出 圆 圈 ， [kjv] When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: [bbe] When he made ready the heavens I was there: when he put an arch over the face of the deep: 8:28 [hgb] 上 使 穹 苍 坚 硬 ， 下 使 渊 源 稳 固 ， [kjv] When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: [bbe] When he made strong the skies overhead: when the fountains of the deep were fixed: 8:29 [hgb] 为 沧 海 定 出 界 限 ， 使 水 不 越 过 他 的 命 令 ， 立 定 大 地 的 根 基 。 [kjv] When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: [bbe] When he put a limit to the sea, so that the waters might not go against his word: when he put in position the bases of the earth: 8:30 [hgb] 那 时 ， 我 在 他 那 里 为 工 师 ， 日 日 为 他 所 喜 爱 ， 常 常 在 他 面 前 踊 跃 ， [kjv] Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; [bbe] Then I was by his side, as a master workman: and I was his delight from day to day, playing before him at all times; 8:31 [hgb] 踊 跃 在 他 为 人 预 备 可 住 之 地 ， 也 喜 悦 住 在 世 人 之 间 。 [kjv] Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. [bbe] Playing in his earth; and my delight was with the sons of men. 8:32 [hgb] 众 子 阿 ， 现 在 要 听 从 我 。 因 为 谨 守 我 道 的 ， 便 为 有 福 。 [kjv] Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways. [bbe] Give ear to me then, my sons: for happy are those who keep my ways. 8:33 [hgb] 要 听 教 训 ， 就 得 智 慧 ， 不 可 弃 绝 。 [kjv] Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. [bbe] Take my teaching and be wise; do not let it go. 8:34 [hgb] 听 从 我 ， 日 日 在 我 门 口 仰 望 ， 在 我 门 框 旁 边 等 候 的 ， 那 人 便 为 有 福 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. [bbe] Happy is the man who gives ear to me, watching at my doors day by day, keeping his place by the pillars of my house. 8:35 [hgb] 因 为 寻 得 我 的 ， 就 寻 得 生 命 ， 也 必 蒙 耶 和 华 的 恩 惠 。 [kjv] For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. [bbe] For whoever gets me gets life, and grace from the Lord will come to him. 8:36 [hgb] 得 罪 我 的 ， 却 害 了 自 己 的 性 命 。 恨 恶 我 的 ， 都 喜 爱 死 亡 。 [kjv] But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death. [bbe] But he who does evil to me, does wrong to his soul: all my haters are in love with death.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1814.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
