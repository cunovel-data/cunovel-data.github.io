but the LORD weigheth the spirits. \\n\\n [bbe] All a man\u0027s ways are clean to himself; but the Lord puts men\u0027s spirits into his scales. \\n\\n 16:3 [hgb] 你 所 作 的 ， 要 交 托 耶 和 华 ， 你 所 谋 的 ， 就 必 成 立 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established. \\n\\n [bbe] Put your works into the hands of the Lord, and your purposes will be made certain. \\n\\n 16:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 所 造 的 ， 各 适 其 用 。 就 是 恶 人 ， 也 为 祸 患 的 日 子 所 造 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. \\n\\n [bbe] The Lord has made everything for his purpose, even the sinner for the day of evil. \\n\\n 16:5 [hgb] 凡 心 里 骄 傲 的 ， 为 耶 和 华 所 憎 恶 。 虽 然 连 手 ， 他 必 不 免 受 罚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. \\n\\n [bbe] Everyone who has pride in his heart is disgusting to the Lord: he will certainly not go free from punishment. \\n\\n 16:6 [hgb] 因 怜 悯 诚 实 ， 罪 孽 得 赎 。 敬 畏 耶 和 华 的 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil. \\n\\n [bbe] By mercy and good faith evil-doing is taken away: and by the fear of the Lord men are turned away from evil. \\n\\n 16:7 [hgb] 人 所 行 的 若 蒙 耶 和 华 喜 悦 ， 耶 和 华 也 使 他 的 仇 敌 与 他 和 好 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When a man\u0027s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. \\n\\n [bbe] When a man\u0027s ways are pleasing to the Lord, he makes even his haters be at peace with him. \\n\\n 16:8 [hgb] 多 有 财 利 ， 行 事 不 义 ， 不 如 少 有 财 利 ， 行 事 公 义 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right. \\n\\n [bbe] Better is a little with righteousness, than great wealth with wrongdoing. \\n\\n 16:9 [hgb] 人 心 筹 算 自 己 的 道 路 。 惟 耶 和 华 指 引 他 的 脚 步 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A man\u0027s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps. \\n\\n [bbe] A man may make designs for his way, but the Lord is the guide of his steps. \\n\\n 16:10 [hgb] 王 的 嘴 中 有 神 语 。 审 判 之 时 ， 他 的 口 ， 必 不 差 错 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment. \\n\\n [bbe] Decision is in the lips of the king: his mouth will not go wrong in judging. \\n\\n 16:11 [hgb] 公 道 的 天 平 和 秤 ， 都 属 耶 和 华 。 囊 中 一 切 法 码 ， 都 为 他 所 定 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A just weight and balance are the LORD\u0027s: all the weights of the bag are his work. \\n\\n [bbe] True measures and scales are the Lord\u0027s: all the weights of the bag are his work. \\n\\n 16:12 [hgb] 作 恶 为 王 所 憎 恶 。 因 国 位 是 靠 公 义 坚 立 。 \\n\\n [kjv] It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness. \\n\\n [bbe] Evil-doing is disgusting to kings: for the seat of the ruler is based on righteousness. \\n\\n 16:13 [hgb] 公 义 的 嘴 ， 为 王 所 喜 悦 。 说 正 直 话 的 ， 为 王 所 喜 爱 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right. \\n\\n [bbe] Lips of righteousness are the delight of kings; and he who says what is upright is dear to him. \\n\\n 16:14 [hgb] 王 的 震 怒 ， 如 杀 人 的 使 者 。 但 智 慧 人 能 止 息 王 怒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it. \\n\\n [bbe] The wrath of the king is like those who give news of death, but a wise man will put peace in place of it. \\n\\n 16:15 [hgb] 王 的 脸 光 ， 使 人 有 生 命 。 王 的 恩 典 ， 好 像 春 云 时 雨 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the light of the king\u0027s countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain. \\n\\n [bbe] In the light of the king\u0027s face there is life; and his approval is like a cloud of spring rain. \\n\\n 16:16 [hgb] 得 智 慧 胜 似 得 金 子 。 选 聪 明 强 如 选 银 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver! \\n\\n [bbe] How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! and to get knowledge is more to be desired than silver. \\n\\n 16:17 [hgb] 正 直 人 的 道 ， 是 远 离 恶 事 。 谨 守 己 路 的 ， 是 保 全 性 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. \\n\\n [bbe] The highway of the upright is to be turned away from evil: he who takes care of his way will keep his soul. \\n\\n 16:18 [hgb] 骄 傲 在 败 坏 以 先 ， 狂 心 在 跌 倒 之 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. \\n\\n [bbe] Pride goes before destruction, and a stiff spirit before a fall. \\n\\n 16:19 [hgb] 心 里 谦 卑 与 穷 乏 人 来 往 ， 强 如 将 掳 物 与 骄 傲 人 同 分 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. \\n\\n [bbe] Better it is to have a gentle spirit with the poor, than to take part in the rewards of war with men of pride. \\n\\n 16:20 [hgb] 谨 守 训 言 的 ， 必 得 好 处 。 倚 靠 耶 和 华 的 ， 便 为 有 福 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he. \\n\\n [bbe] He who gives attention to the law of right will get good; and whoever puts his faith in the Lord is happy. \\n\\n 16:21 [hgb] 心 中 有 智 慧 ， 必 称 为 通 达 人 。 嘴 中 的 甜 言 ， 加 增 人 的 学 问 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. \\n\\n [bbe] The wise-hearted will be named men of good sense: and by pleasing words learning is increased. \\n\\n 16:22 [hgb] 人 有 智 慧 就 有 生 命 的 泉 源 。 愚 昧 人 必 被 愚 昧 惩 治 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly. \\n\\n [bbe] Wisdom is a fountain of life to him who has it; but the punishment of the foolish is their foolish behaviour. \\n\\n 16:23 [hgb] 智 慧 人 的 心 ， 教 训 他 的 口 ， 又 使 他 的 嘴 ， 增 长 学 问 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. \\n\\n [bbe] The heart of the wise man is the teacher of his mouth, and gives increased learning to his lips. \\n\\n 16:24 [hgb] 良 言 如 同 蜂 房 ， 使 心 觉 甘 甜 ， 使 骨 得 医 治 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. \\n\\n [bbe] Pleasing words are like honey, sweet to the soul and new life to the bones. \\n\\n 16:25 [hgb] 有 一 条 路 ， 人 以 为 正 ， 至 终 成 为 死 亡 之 路 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. \\n\\n [bbe] There is a way which seems straight before a man, but its end is the ways of death. \\n\\n 16:26 [hgb] 劳 力 人 的 胃 口 ， 使 他 劳 力 ， 因 为 他 的 口 腹 催 逼 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him. \\n\\n [bbe] The desire of the working man is working for him, for his need of food is driving him on. \\n\\n 16:27 [hgb] 匪 徒 图 谋 奸 恶 ， 嘴 上 仿 佛 有 烧 焦 的 火 。 \\n\\n [kjv] An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire. \\n\\n [bbe] A good-for-nothing man is a designer of evil, and in his lips there is a burning fire. \\n\\n 16:28 [hgb] 乖 僻 人 播 散 分 争 。 传 舌 的 离 间 密 友 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. \\n\\n [bbe] A man of twisted purposes is a cause of fighting everywhere: and he who says evil secretly makes trouble between friends. \\n\\n 16:29 [hgb] 强 暴 人 诱 惑 邻 舍 ， 领 他 走 不 善 之 道 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good. \\n\\n [bbe] A violent man puts desire of evil into his neighbour\u0027s mind, and makes him go in a way which is not good. \\n\\n 16:30 [hgb] 眼 目 紧 合 的 ， 图 谋 乖 僻 ， 嘴 唇 紧 闭 的 ， 成 就 邪 恶 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass. \\n\\n [bbe] He whose eyes are shut is a man of twisted purposes, and he who keeps his lips shut tight makes evil come about. \\n\\n 16:31 [hgb] 白 发 是 荣 耀 的 冠 冕 。 在 公 义 的 道 上 ， 必 能 得 着 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness. \\n\\n [bbe] The grey head is a crown of glory, if it is seen in the way of righteousness. \\n\\n 16:32 [hgb] 不 轻 易 发 怒 的 ， 胜 过 勇 士 。 治 服 己 心 的 ， 强 如 取 城 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. \\n\\n [bbe] He who is slow to be angry is better than a man of war, and he who has control over his spirit than he who takes a town. \\n\\n 16:33 [hgb] 签 放 在 怀 里 。 定 事 由 耶 和 华 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] A thing may be put to the decision of chance, but it comes about through the Lord. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1822.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
