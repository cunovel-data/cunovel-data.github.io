{"id":5508,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"2:1 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 你 若 领 受 我 的 言 语 ， 存 记 我 的 命 令 ， \n [kjv] My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; \n [bbe] My son, if you will take my words to your heart, storing up my laws in your mind; \n 2:2 [hgb] 侧 耳 听 智 慧 ， 专 心 求 聪 明 。 \n [kjv] So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; \n [bbe] So that your ear gives attention to wisdom, and your heart is turned to knowledge; \n 2:3 [hgb] 呼 求 明 哲 ， 扬 声 求 聪 明 ， \n [kjv] Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; \n [bbe] Truly, if you are crying out for good sense, and your request is for knowledge; \n 2:4 [hgb] 寻 找 他 如 寻 找 银 子 ， 搜 求 他 如 搜 求 隐 藏 的 珍 宝 ， \n [kjv] If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; \n [bbe] If you are looking for her as for silver, and searching for her as for stored-up wealth; \n 2:5 [hgb] 你 就 明 白 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 得 以 认 识 神 。 \n [kjv] Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. \n [bbe] Then the fear of the Lord will be clear to you, and knowledge of God will be yours. \n 2:6 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 赐 人 智 慧 。 知 识 和 聪 明 ， 都 由 他 口 而 出 。 \n [kjv] For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. \n [bbe] For the Lord gives wisdom; out of his mouth come knowledge and reason: \n 2:7 [hgb] 他 给 正 直 人 存 留 真 智 慧 ， 给 行 为 纯 正 的 人 作 盾 牌 。 \n [kjv] He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. \n [bbe] He has salvation stored up for the upright, he is a breastplate to those in whom there is no evil; \n 2:8 [hgb] 为 要 保 守 公 平 人 的 路 ， 护 庇 虔 敬 人 的 道 。 \n [kjv] He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. \n [bbe] He keeps watch on the ways which are right, and takes care of those who have the fear of him. \n 2:9 [hgb] 你 也 必 明 白 仁 义 ， 公 平 ， 正 直 ， 一 切 的 善 道 。 \n [kjv] Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path. \n [bbe] Then you will have knowledge of righteousness and right acting, and upright behaviour, even of every good way. \n 2:10 [hgb] 智 慧 必 入 你 心 。 你 的 灵 要 以 知 识 为 美 。 \n [kjv] When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; \n [bbe] For wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul; \n 2:11 [hgb] 谋 略 必 护 卫 你 。 聪 明 必 保 守 你 。 \n [kjv] Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: \n [bbe] Wise purposes will be watching over you, and knowledge will keep you; \n 2:12 [hgb] 要 救 你 脱 离 恶 道 ， （ 恶 道 或 作 恶 人 的 道 ） 脱 离 说 乖 谬 话 的 人 。 \n [kjv] To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; \n [bbe] Giving you salvation from the evil man, from those whose words are false; \n 2:13 [hgb] 那 等 人 舍 弃 正 直 的 路 ， 行 走 黑 暗 的 道 ， \n [kjv] Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; \n [bbe] Who give up the way of righteousness, to go by dark roads; \n 2:14 [hgb] 欢 喜 作 恶 ， 喜 爱 恶 人 的 乖 僻 。 \n [kjv] Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; \n [bbe] Who take pleasure in wrongdoing, and have joy in the evil designs of the sinner; \n 2:15 [hgb] 在 他 们 的 道 中 弯 曲 ， 在 他 们 的 路 上 偏 僻 。 \n [kjv] Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: \n [bbe] Whose ways are not straight, and whose footsteps are turned to evil: \n 2:16 [hgb] 智 慧 要 救 你 脱 离 淫 妇 ， 就 是 那 油 嘴 滑 舌 的 外 女 。 \n [kjv] To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; \n [bbe] To take you out of the power of the strange woman, who says smooth words with her tongue; \n 2:17 [hgb] 她 离 弃 幼 年 的 配 偶 ， 忘 了 神 的 盟 约 。 \n [kjv] Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. \n [bbe] Who is false to the husband of her early years, and does not keep the agreement of her God in mind: \n 2:18 [hgb] 她 的 家 陷 入 死 地 ， 她 的 路 偏 向 阴 间 。 \n [kjv] For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. \n [bbe] For her house is on the way down to death; her footsteps go down to the shades: \n 2:19 [hgb] 凡 到 她 那 里 去 的 不 得 转 回 ， 也 得 不 着 生 命 的 路 。 \n [kjv] None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. \n [bbe] Those who go to her do not come back again; their feet do not keep in the ways of life: \n 2:20 [hgb] 智 慧 必 使 你 行 善 人 的 道 ， 守 义 人 的 路 。 \n [kjv] That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. \n [bbe] So that you may go in the way of good men, and keep in the footsteps of the upright. \n 2:21 [hgb] 正 直 人 必 在 世 上 居 住 。 完 全 人 必 在 地 上 存 留 。 \n [kjv] For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. \n [bbe] For the upright will be living in the land, and the good will have it for their heritage. \n 2:22 [hgb] 惟 有 恶 人 必 然 剪 除 。 奸 诈 的 必 然 拔 出 。 \n [kjv] But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. \n [bbe] But sinners will be cut off from the land, and those whose acts are false will be uprooted. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1808.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
