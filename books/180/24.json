{"id":5530,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"24:1 [hgb] 你 不 要 嫉 妒 恶 人 ， 也 不 要 起 意 与 他 们 相 处 。 [kjv] Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them. [bbe] Have no envy for evil men, or any desire to be with them: 24:2 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 的 心 ， 图 谋 强 暴 。 他 们 的 口 谈 论 奸 恶 。 [kjv] For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. [bbe] For the purposes of their hearts are destruction, and their lips are talking of trouble. 24:3 [hgb] 房 屋 因 智 慧 建 造 ， 又 因 聪 明 立 稳 。 [kjv] Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: [bbe] The building of a house is by wisdom, and by reason it is made strong: 24:4 [hgb] 其 中 因 知 识 充 满 各 样 美 好 宝 贵 的 财 物 。 [kjv] And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. [bbe] And by knowledge its rooms are full of all dear and pleasing things. 24:5 [hgb] 智 慧 人 大 有 能 力 。 有 知 识 的 人 ， 力 上 加 力 。 [kjv] A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. [bbe] A wise man is strong; and a man of knowledge makes strength greater. 24:6 [hgb] 你 去 打 仗 ， 要 凭 智 谋 。 谋 士 众 多 ， 人 便 得 胜 。 [kjv] For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety. [bbe] For by wise guiding you will overcome in war: and in a number of wise guides there is salvation. 24:7 [hgb] 智 慧 极 高 ， 非 愚 昧 人 所 能 及 ， 所 以 在 城 门 内 ， 不 敢 开 口 。 [kjv] Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. [bbe] Wisdom is outside the power of the foolish: he keeps his mouth shut in the public place. 24:8 [hgb] 设 计 作 恶 的 ， 必 称 为 奸 人 。 [kjv] He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. [bbe] He whose purposes are bad will be named a man of evil designs. 24:9 [hgb] 愚 妄 人 的 思 念 ， 乃 是 罪 恶 。 亵 慢 者 为 人 所 憎 恶 。 [kjv] The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men. [bbe] The purpose of the foolish is sin: and the hater of authority is disgusting to others. 24:10 [hgb] 你 在 患 难 之 日 若 胆 怯 ， 你 的 力 量 就 微 小 。 [kjv] If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. [bbe] If you give way in the day of trouble, your strength is small. 24:11 [hgb] 人 被 拉 到 死 地 ， 你 要 解 救 。 人 将 被 杀 ， 你 须 拦 阻 。 [kjv] If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain; [bbe] Be the saviour of those who are given up to death, and do not keep back help from those who are slipping to destruction. 24:12 [hgb] 你 若 说 ， 这 事 我 未 曾 知 道 。 那 衡 量 人 心 的 ， 岂 不 明 白 吗 ？ 保 守 你 命 的 ， 岂 不 知 道 吗 ？ 他 岂 不 按 各 人 所 行 的 ， 报 应 各 人 吗 ？ [kjv] If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works? [bbe] If you say, See, we had no knowledge of this: does not the tester of hearts give thought to it? and he who keeps your soul, has he no knowledge of it? and will he not give to every man the reward of his work? 24:13 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 你 要 吃 蜜 ， 因 为 是 好 的 。 吃 蜂 房 下 滴 的 蜜 ， 便 觉 甘 甜 。 [kjv] My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste: [bbe] My son, take honey, for it is good; and the flowing honey, which is sweet to your taste: 24:14 [hgb] 你 心 得 了 智 慧 ， 也 必 觉 得 如 此 。 你 若 找 着 ， 至 终 必 有 善 报 。 你 的 指 望 ， 也 不 至 断 绝 。 [kjv] So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off. [bbe] So let your desire be for wisdom: if you have it, there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off. 24:15 [hgb] 你 这 恶 人 ， 不 要 埋 伏 攻 击 义 人 的 家 。 不 要 毁 坏 他 安 居 之 所 。 [kjv] Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place: [bbe] Do not keep a secret watch, O evil-doer, against the fields of the upright man, or send destruction on his resting-place: 24:16 [hgb] 因 为 义 人 虽 七 次 跌 倒 ， 仍 必 兴 起 。 恶 人 却 被 祸 患 倾 倒 。 [kjv] For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. [bbe] For an upright man, after falling seven times, will get up again: but trouble is the downfall of the evil. 24:17 [hgb] 你 仇 敌 跌 倒 ， 你 不 要 欢 喜 。 他 倾 倒 ， 你 心 不 要 快 乐 。 [kjv] Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: [bbe] Do not be glad at the fall of your hater, and let not your heart have joy at his downfall: 24:18 [hgb] 恐 怕 耶 和 华 看 见 就 不 喜 悦 ， 将 怒 气 从 仇 敌 身 上 转 过 来 。 [kjv] Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him. [bbe] For fear that the Lord may see it, and it may be evil in his eyes, and his wrath may be turned away from him. 24:19 [hgb] 不 要 为 作 恶 的 心 怀 不 平 。 也 不 要 嫉 妒 恶 人 。 [kjv] Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked; [bbe] Do not be troubled because of evil-doers, or have envy of sinners: 24:20 [hgb] 因 为 恶 人 终 不 得 善 报 。 恶 人 的 灯 也 必 熄 灭 。 [kjv] For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out. [bbe] For there will be no future for the evil man; the light of sinners will be put out. 24:21 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 你 要 敬 畏 耶 和 华 与 君 王 。 不 要 与 反 覆 无 常 的 人 结 交 。 [kjv] My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change: [bbe] My son, go in fear of the Lord and the king: have nothing to do with those who are in high positions: 24:22 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 的 灾 难 ， 必 忽 然 而 起 。 耶 和 华 与 君 王 所 施 行 的 毁 灭 ， 谁 能 知 道 呢 ？ [kjv] For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? [bbe] For their downfall will come suddenly; and who has knowledge of the destruction of those in high positions? 24:23 [hgb] 以 下 也 是 智 慧 人 的 箴 言 。 审 判 时 看 人 情 面 ， 是 不 好 的 。 [kjv] These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment. [bbe] These are more sayings of the wise: To have respect for a person\u0027s position when judging is not good. 24:24 [hgb] 对 恶 人 说 ， 你 是 义 人 的 ， 这 人 万 民 必 咒 诅 ， 列 邦 必 憎 恶 。 [kjv] He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him: [bbe] He who says to the evil-doer, You are upright, will be cursed by peoples and hated by nations. 24:25 [hgb] 责 备 恶 人 的 ， 必 得 喜 悦 。 美 好 的 福 ， 也 必 临 到 他 。 [kjv] But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. [bbe] But those who say sharp words to him will have delight, and a blessing of good will come on them. 24:26 [hgb] 应 对 正 直 的 ， 犹 如 与 人 亲 嘴 。 [kjv] Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer. [bbe] He gives a kiss with his lips who gives a right answer. 24:27 [hgb] 你 要 在 外 头 预 备 工 料 ， 在 田 间 办 理 整 齐 ， 然 后 建 造 房 屋 。 [kjv] Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house. [bbe] Put your work in order outside, and make it ready in the field; and after that, see to the building of your house. 24:28 [hgb] 不 可 无 故 作 见 证 ， 陷 害 邻 舍 。 也 不 可 用 嘴 欺 骗 人 。 [kjv] Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips. [bbe] Do not be a violent witness against your neighbour, or let your lips say what is false. 24:29 [hgb] 不 可 说 ， 人 怎 样 待 我 ， 我 也 怎 样 待 他 ， 我 必 照 他 所 行 的 报 复 他 。 [kjv] Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work. [bbe] Say not, I will do to him as he has done to me; I will give the man the reward of his work. 24:30 [hgb] 我 经 过 懒 惰 人 的 田 地 ， 无 知 人 的 葡 萄 园 。 [kjv] I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; [bbe] I went by the field of the hater of work, and by the vine-garden of the man without sense; 24:31 [hgb] 荆 棘 长 满 了 地 皮 ， 刺 草 遮 盖 了 田 面 ， 石 墙 也 坍 塌 了 。 [kjv] And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. [bbe] And it was all full of thorns, and covered with waste plants, and its stone wall was broken down. 24:32 [hgb] 我 看 见 就 留 心 思 想 ， 我 看 着 就 领 了 训 诲 。 [kjv] Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction. [bbe] Then looking at it, I gave thought: I saw, and I got teaching from it. 24:33 [hgb] 再 睡 片 时 ， 打 盹 片 时 ， 抱 着 手 躺 卧 片 时 ， [kjv] Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: [bbe] A little sleep, a little rest, a little folding of the hands in sleep: 24:34 [hgb] 你 的 贫 穷 ， 就 必 如 强 盗 速 来 ， 你 的 缺 乏 ， 仿 佛 拿 兵 器 的 人 来 到 。 [kjv] So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man. [bbe] So loss will come on you like an outlaw, and your need like an armed man.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1830.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
