{"id":5535,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"29:1 [hgb] 人 屡 次 受 责 罚 ， 仍 然 硬 着 颈 项 ， 他 必 顷 刻 败 坏 ， 无 法 可 治 。 [kjv] He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. [bbe] A man hating sharp words and making his heart hard, will suddenly be broken and will not be made well again. 29:2 [hgb] 义 人 增 多 ， 民 就 喜 乐 。 恶 人 掌 权 ， 民 就 叹 息 。 [kjv] When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. [bbe] When the upright have power, the people are glad; when an evil man is ruler, grief comes on the people. 29:3 [hgb] 爱 慕 智 慧 的 ， 使 父 亲 喜 乐 。 与 妓 女 结 交 的 ， 却 浪 费 钱 财 。 [kjv] Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance. [bbe] A man who is a lover of wisdom is a joy to his father: but he who goes in the company of loose women is a waster of wealth. 29:4 [hgb] 王 借 公 平 ， 使 国 坚 定 。 索 要 贿 赂 ， 使 国 倾 败 。 [kjv] The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. [bbe] A king, by right rule, makes the land safe; but one full of desires makes it a waste. 29:5 [hgb] 谄 媚 邻 舍 的 ， 就 是 设 网 罗 绊 他 的 脚 。 [kjv] A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. [bbe] A man who says smooth things to his neighbour is stretching out a net for his steps. 29:6 [hgb] 恶 人 犯 罪 ， 自 陷 网 罗 。 惟 独 义 人 ， 欢 呼 喜 乐 。 [kjv] In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. [bbe] In the steps of an evil man there is a net for him, but the upright man gets away quickly and is glad. 29:7 [hgb] 义 人 知 道 查 明 穷 人 的 案 。 恶 人 没 有 聪 明 ， 就 不 得 而 知 。 [kjv] The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it. [bbe] The upright man gives attention to the cause of the poor: the evil-doer gives no thought to it. 29:8 [hgb] 亵 慢 人 煽 惑 通 城 。 智 慧 人 止 息 众 怒 。 [kjv] Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath. [bbe] Men of pride are the cause of violent acts in a town, but by wise men wrath is turned away. 29:9 [hgb] 智 慧 人 与 愚 妄 人 相 争 ， 或 怒 ， 或 笑 ， 总 不 能 使 他 止 息 。 [kjv] If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest. [bbe] If a wise man goes to law with a foolish man, he may be angry or laughing, but there will be no rest. 29:10 [hgb] 好 流 人 血 的 ， 恨 恶 完 全 人 。 索 取 正 直 人 的 性 命 。 [kjv] The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. [bbe] Men of blood are haters of the good man, and evil-doers go after his soul. 29:11 [hgb] 愚 妄 人 怒 气 全 发 。 智 慧 人 忍 气 含 怒 。 [kjv] A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards. [bbe] A foolish man lets out all his wrath, but a wise man keeps it back quietly. 29:12 [hgb] 君 王 若 听 谎 言 ， 他 一 切 臣 仆 都 是 奸 恶 。 [kjv] If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked. [bbe] If a ruler gives attention to false words, all his servants are evil-doers. 29:13 [hgb] 贫 穷 人 ， 强 暴 人 ， 在 世 相 遇 ， 他 们 的 眼 目 ， 都 蒙 耶 和 华 光 照 。 [kjv] The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes. [bbe] The poor man and his creditor come face to face: the Lord gives light to their eyes equally. 29:14 [hgb] 君 王 凭 诚 实 判 断 穷 人 ， 他 的 国 位 ， 必 永 远 坚 立 。 [kjv] The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. [bbe] The king who is a true judge in the cause of the poor, will be safe for ever on the seat of his power. 29:15 [hgb] 杖 打 和 责 备 ， 能 加 增 智 慧 。 放 纵 的 儿 子 ， 使 母 亲 羞 愧 。 [kjv] The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame. [bbe] The rod and sharp words give wisdom: but a child who is not guided is a cause of shame to his mother. 29:16 [hgb] 恶 人 加 多 ， 过 犯 也 加 多 。 义 人 必 看 见 他 们 跌 倒 。 [kjv] When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. [bbe] When evil men are in power, wrongdoing is increased; but the upright will have pleasure when they see their downfall. 29:17 [hgb] 管 教 你 的 儿 子 ， 他 就 使 你 得 安 息 ， 也 必 使 你 心 里 喜 乐 。 [kjv] Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. [bbe] Give your son training, and he will give you rest; he will give delight to your soul. 29:18 [hgb] 没 有 异 象 ， （ 或 作 默 示 ） 民 就 放 肆 。 惟 遵 守 律 法 的 ， 便 为 有 福 。 [kjv] Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. [bbe] Where there is no vision, the people are uncontrolled; but he who keeps the law will be happy. 29:19 [hgb] 只 用 言 语 ， 仆 人 不 肯 受 管 教 ， 他 虽 然 明 白 ， 也 不 留 意 。 [kjv] A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer. [bbe] A servant will not be trained by words; for though the sense of the words is clear to him, he will not give attention. 29:20 [hgb] 你 见 言 语 急 躁 的 人 吗 ？ 愚 昧 人 比 他 更 有 指 望 。 [kjv] Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him. [bbe] Have you seen a man who is quick with his tongue? There is more hope for a foolish man than for him. 29:21 [hgb] 人 将 仆 人 从 小 娇 养 ， 这 仆 人 终 久 必 成 了 他 的 儿 子 。 [kjv] He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length. [bbe] If a servant is gently cared for from his early years, he will become a cause of sorrow in the end. 29:22 [hgb] 好 气 的 人 ， 挑 启 争 端 。 暴 怒 的 人 ， 多 多 犯 罪 。 [kjv] An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. [bbe] An angry man is the cause of fighting, and a man given to wrath does much wrong. 29:23 [hgb] 人 的 高 傲 ， 必 使 他 卑 下 。 心 里 谦 逊 的 ， 必 得 尊 荣 。 [kjv] A man\u0027s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. [bbe] A man\u0027s pride will be the cause of his fall, but he who has a gentle spirit will get honour. 29:24 [hgb] 人 与 盗 贼 分 赃 ， 是 恨 恶 自 己 的 性 命 。 他 听 见 叫 人 发 誓 的 声 音 ， 却 不 言 语 。 [kjv] Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not. [bbe] A man who takes part with a thief has hate for his soul; he is put under oath, but says nothing. 29:25 [hgb] 惧 怕 人 的 陷 入 网 罗 。 惟 有 倚 靠 耶 和 华 的 ， 必 得 安 稳 。 [kjv] The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. [bbe] The fear of man is a cause of danger: but whoever puts his faith in the Lord will have a safe place on high. 29:26 [hgb] 求 王 恩 的 人 多 。 定 人 事 乃 在 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] Many seek the ruler\u0027s favour; but every man\u0027s judgment cometh from the LORD. [bbe] The approval of a ruler is desired by great numbers: but the decision in a man\u0027s cause comes from the Lord. 29:27 [hgb] 为 非 作 歹 的 ， 被 义 人 憎 嫌 。 行 事 正 直 的 ， 被 恶 人 憎 恶 。 [kjv] An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked. [bbe] An evil man is disgusting to the upright, and he who is upright is disgusting to evil-doers.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1835.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
