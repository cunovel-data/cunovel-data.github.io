{"id":5511,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"5:1 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 要 留 心 我 智 慧 的 话 语 ， 侧 耳 听 我 聪 明 的 言 词 。 [kjv] My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: [bbe] My son, give attention to my wisdom; let your ear be turned to my teaching: 5:2 [hgb] 为 要 使 你 谨 守 谋 略 ， 嘴 唇 保 存 知 识 。 [kjv] That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. [bbe] So that you may be ruled by a wise purpose, and your lips may keep knowledge. 5:3 [hgb] 因 为 淫 妇 的 嘴 滴 下 蜂 蜜 ， 她 的 口 比 油 更 滑 。 [kjv] For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: [bbe] For honey is dropping from the lips of the strange woman, and her mouth is smoother than oil; 5:4 [hgb] 至 终 却 苦 似 茵 陈 ， 快 如 两 刃 的 刀 。 [kjv] But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. [bbe] But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword; 5:5 [hgb] 她 的 脚 ， 下 入 死 地 。 她 脚 步 ， 踏 住 阴 间 。 [kjv] Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. [bbe] Her feet go down to death, and her steps to the underworld; 5:6 [hgb] 以 致 她 找 不 着 生 命 平 坦 的 道 。 她 的 路 变 迁 不 定 ， 自 己 还 不 知 道 。 [kjv] Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. [bbe] She never keeps her mind on the road of life; her ways are uncertain, she has no knowledge. 5:7 [hgb] 众 子 阿 ， 现 在 要 听 从 我 ， 不 可 离 弃 我 口 中 的 话 。 [kjv] Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. [bbe] Give ear to me then, my sons, and do not put away my words from you. 5:8 [hgb] 你 所 行 的 道 要 离 她 远 ， 不 可 就 近 她 的 房 门 。 [kjv] Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: [bbe] Go far away from her, do not come near the door of her house; 5:9 [hgb] 恐 怕 将 你 的 尊 荣 给 别 人 ， 将 你 的 岁 月 给 残 忍 的 人 。 [kjv] Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: [bbe] For fear that you may give your honour to others, and your wealth to strange men: 5:10 [hgb] 恐 怕 外 人 满 得 你 的 力 量 ， 你 劳 碌 得 来 的 ， 归 入 外 人 的 家 。 [kjv] Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; [bbe] And strange men may be full of your wealth, and the fruit of your work go to the house of others; 5:11 [hgb] 终 久 你 皮 肉 和 身 体 消 毁 ， 你 就 悲 叹 ， [kjv] And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, [bbe] And you will be full of grief at the end of your life, when your flesh and your body are wasted; 5:12 [hgb] 说 ， 我 怎 么 恨 恶 训 诲 ， 心 中 藐 视 责 备 ， [kjv] And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; [bbe] And you will say, How was teaching hated by me, and my heart put no value on training; 5:13 [hgb] 也 不 听 从 我 师 傅 的 话 ， 又 不 侧 耳 听 那 教 训 我 的 人 。 [kjv] And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! [bbe] I did not give attention to the voice of my teachers, my ear was not turned to those who were guiding me! 5:14 [hgb] 我 在 圣 会 里 ， 几 乎 落 在 诸 般 恶 中 。 [kjv] I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. [bbe] I was in almost all evil in the company of the people. 5:15 [hgb] 你 要 喝 自 己 池 中 的 水 ， 饮 自 己 井 里 的 活 水 。 [kjv] Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. [bbe] Let water from your store and not that of others be your drink, and running water from your fountain. 5:16 [hgb] 你 的 泉 源 岂 可 涨 溢 在 外 。 你 的 河 水 岂 可 流 在 街 上 。 [kjv] Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. [bbe] Let not your springs be flowing in the streets, or your streams of water in the open places. 5:17 [hgb] 惟 独 归 你 一 人 ， 不 可 与 外 人 同 用 。 [kjv] Let them be only thine own, and not strangers\u0027 with thee. [bbe] Let them be for yourself only, not for other men with you. 5:18 [hgb] 要 使 你 的 泉 源 蒙 福 。 要 喜 悦 你 幼 年 所 娶 的 妻 。 [kjv] Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. [bbe] Let blessing be on your fountain; have joy in the wife of your early years. 5:19 [hgb] 她 如 可 爱 的 ？ ？ 鹿 ， 可 喜 的 母 鹿 。 愿 她 的 胸 怀 ， 使 你 时 时 知 足 。 她 的 爱 情 ， 使 你 常 常 恋 慕 。 [kjv] Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. [bbe] As a loving hind and a gentle doe, let her breasts ever give you rapture; let your passion at all times be moved by her love. 5:20 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 你 为 何 恋 慕 淫 妇 ， 为 何 抱 外 女 的 胸 怀 。 [kjv] And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? [bbe] Why let yourself, my son, go out of the way with a strange woman, and take another woman in your arms? 5:21 [hgb] 因 为 人 所 行 的 道 ， 都 在 耶 和 华 眼 前 。 他 也 修 平 人 一 切 的 路 。 [kjv] For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. [bbe] For a man\u0027s ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and he puts all his goings in the scales. 5:22 [hgb] 恶 人 必 被 自 己 的 罪 孽 捉 住 。 他 必 被 自 己 的 罪 恶 如 绳 索 缠 绕 。 [kjv] His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. [bbe] The evil-doer will be taken in the net of his crimes, and prisoned in the cords of his sin. 5:23 [hgb] 他 因 不 受 训 诲 ， 就 必 死 亡 。 又 因 愚 昧 过 甚 ， 必 走 差 了 路 。 [kjv] He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. [bbe] He will come to his end for need of teaching; he is so foolish that he will go wandering from the right way.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1811.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
