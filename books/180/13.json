{"id":5519,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"13:1 [hgb] 智 慧 子 听 父 亲 的 教 训 。 亵 慢 人 不 听 责 备 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A wise son heareth his father\u0027s instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke. \\n\\n [bbe] A wise son is a lover of teaching, but the ears of the haters of authority are shut to sharp words. \\n\\n 13:2 [hgb] 人 因 口 所 结 的 果 子 ， 必 享 美 福 。 奸 诈 人 必 遭 强 暴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence. \\n\\n [bbe] A man will get good from the fruit of his lips, but the desire of the false is for violent acts. \\n\\n 13:3 [hgb] 谨 守 口 的 ， 得 保 生 命 。 大 张 嘴 的 ， 必 致 败 亡 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. \\n\\n [bbe] He who keeps a watch on his mouth keeps his life; but he whose lips are open wide will have destruction. \\n\\n 13:4 [hgb] 懒 惰 人 羡 慕 ， 却 无 所 得 。 殷 勤 人 必 得 丰 裕 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. \\n\\n [bbe] The hater of work does not get his desires, but the soul of the hard workers will be made fat. \\n\\n 13:5 [hgb] 义 人 恨 恶 谎 言 。 恶 人 有 臭 名 ， 且 致 惭 愧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame. \\n\\n [bbe] The upright man is a hater of false words: the evil-doer gets a bad name and is put to shame. \\n\\n 13:6 [hgb] 行 为 正 直 的 ， 有 公 义 保 守 。 犯 罪 的 被 邪 恶 倾 覆 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner. \\n\\n [bbe] Righteousness keeps safe him whose way is without error, but evil-doers are overturned by sin. \\n\\n 13:7 [hgb] 假 作 富 足 的 ， 却 一 无 所 有 。 装 作 穷 乏 的 ， 却 广 有 财 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches. \\n\\n [bbe] A man may be acting as if he had wealth, but have nothing; another may seem poor, but have great wealth. \\n\\n 13:8 [hgb] 人 的 赀 财 ， 是 他 生 命 的 赎 价 。 穷 乏 人 却 听 不 见 威 吓 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The ransom of a man\u0027s life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke. \\n\\n [bbe] A man will give his wealth in exchange for his life; but the poor will not give ear to sharp words. \\n\\n 13:9 [hgb] 义 人 的 光 明 亮 。 （ 明 亮 原 文 作 欢 喜 ） 恶 人 的 灯 要 熄 灭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. \\n\\n [bbe] There is a glad dawn for the upright man, but the light of the sinner will be put out. \\n\\n 13:10 [hgb] 骄 傲 只 启 争 竞 。 听 劝 言 的 ， 却 有 智 慧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom. \\n\\n [bbe] The only effect of pride is fighting; but wisdom is with the quiet in spirit. \\n\\n 13:11 [hgb] 不 劳 而 得 之 财 ， 必 然 消 耗 。 勤 劳 积 蓄 的 ， 必 见 加 增 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase. \\n\\n [bbe] Wealth quickly got will become less; but he who gets a store by the work of his hands will have it increased. \\n\\n 13:12 [hgb] 所 盼 望 的 迟 延 未 得 ， 令 人 心 忧 。 所 愿 意 的 临 到 ， 却 是 生 命 树 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life. \\n\\n [bbe] Hope put off is a weariness to the heart; but when what is desired comes, it is a tree of life. \\n\\n 13:13 [hgb] 藐 视 训 言 的 ， 自 取 灭 亡 。 敬 畏 诫 命 的 ， 必 得 善 报 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. \\n\\n [bbe] He who makes sport of the word will come to destruction, but the respecter of the law will be rewarded. \\n\\n 13:14 [hgb] 智 慧 人 的 法 则 ， （ 或 作 指 教 ） 是 生 命 的 泉 源 ， 可 以 使 人 离 开 死 亡 的 网 罗 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. \\n\\n [bbe] The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, turning men away from the nets of death. \\n\\n 13:15 [hgb] 美 好 的 聪 明 ， 使 人 蒙 恩 。 奸 诈 人 的 道 路 ， 崎 岖 难 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard. \\n\\n [bbe] Wise behaviour gets approval, but the way of the false is their destruction. \\n\\n 13:16 [hgb] 凡 通 达 人 都 凭 知 识 行 事 。 愚 昧 人 张 扬 自 己 的 愚 昧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly. \\n\\n [bbe] A sharp man does everything with knowledge, but a foolish man makes clear his foolish thoughts. \\n\\n 13:17 [hgb] 奸 恶 的 使 者 ， 必 陷 在 祸 患 里 。 忠 信 的 使 臣 ， 乃 医 人 的 良 药 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health. \\n\\n [bbe] A man taking false news is a cause of trouble, but he who gives news rightly makes things well. \\n\\n 13:18 [hgb] 弃 绝 管 教 的 ， 必 致 贫 受 辱 。 领 受 责 备 的 ， 必 得 尊 荣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. \\n\\n [bbe] Need and shame will be the fate of him who is uncontrolled by training; but he who takes note of teaching will be honoured. \\n\\n 13:19 [hgb] 所 欲 的 成 就 ， 心 觉 甘 甜 。 远 离 恶 事 ， 为 愚 昧 人 所 憎 恶 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil. \\n\\n [bbe] To get one\u0027s desire is sweet to the soul, but to give up evil is disgusting to the foolish. \\n\\n 13:20 [hgb] 与 智 慧 人 同 行 的 ， 必 得 智 慧 。 和 愚 昧 人 作 伴 的 ， 必 受 亏 损 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. \\n\\n [bbe] Go with wise men and be wise: but he who keeps company with the foolish will be broken. \\n\\n 13:21 [hgb] 祸 患 追 赶 罪 人 。 义 人 必 得 善 报 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed. \\n\\n [bbe] Evil will overtake sinners, but the upright will be rewarded with good. \\n\\n 13:22 [hgb] 善 人 给 子 孙 遗 留 产 业 。 罪 人 为 义 人 积 存 赀 财 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children\u0027s children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. \\n\\n [bbe] The heritage of the good man is handed down to his children\u0027s children; and the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the upright man. \\n\\n 13:23 [hgb] 穷 人 耕 种 多 得 粮 食 ， 但 因 不 义 有 消 灭 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment. \\n\\n [bbe] There is much food in the ploughed land of the poor; but it is taken away by wrongdoing. \\n\\n 13:24 [hgb] 不 忍 用 杖 打 儿 子 的 ， 是 恨 恶 他 。 疼 爱 儿 子 的 ， 随 时 管 教 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. \\n\\n [bbe] He who keeps back his rod is unkind to his son: the loving father gives punishment with care. \\n\\n 13:25 [hgb] 义 人 吃 得 饱 足 。 恶 人 肚 腹 缺 粮 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want. \\n\\n [bbe] The upright man has food to the full measure of his desire, but there will be no food for the stomach of evil-doers. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1819.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
