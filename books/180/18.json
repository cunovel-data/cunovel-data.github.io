{"id":5524,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"18:1 [hgb] 与 众 寡 合 的 ， 独 自 寻 求 心 愿 ， 并 恼 恨 一 切 真 智 慧 。 [kjv] Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom. [bbe] He who keeps himself separate for his private purpose goes against all good sense. 18:2 [hgb] 愚 昧 人 不 喜 爱 明 哲 ， 只 喜 爱 显 露 心 意 。 [kjv] A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself. [bbe] A foolish man has no pleasure in good sense, but only to let what is in his heart come to light. 18:3 [hgb] 恶 人 来 ， 藐 视 随 来 。 羞 耻 到 ， 辱 骂 同 到 。 [kjv] When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach. [bbe] When the evil-doer comes, a low opinion comes with him, and with the loss of honour comes shame. 18:4 [hgb] 人 口 中 的 言 语 ， 如 同 深 水 。 智 慧 的 泉 源 ， 好 像 涌 流 的 河 水 。 [kjv] The words of a man\u0027s mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook. [bbe] The words of a man\u0027s mouth are like deep waters: the fountain of wisdom is like a flowing stream. 18:5 [hgb] 瞻 徇 恶 人 的 情 面 ， 偏 断 义 人 的 案 件 ， 都 为 不 善 。 [kjv] It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. [bbe] To have respect for the person of the evil-doer is not good, or to give a wrong decision against the upright. 18:6 [hgb] 愚 昧 人 张 嘴 启 争 端 ， 开 口 招 鞭 打 。 [kjv] A fool\u0027s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes. [bbe] A foolish man\u0027s lips are a cause of fighting, and his mouth makes him open to blows. 18:7 [hgb] 愚 昧 人 的 口 ， 自 取 败 坏 。 他 的 嘴 ， 是 他 生 命 的 网 罗 。 [kjv] A fool\u0027s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul. [bbe] The mouth of a foolish man is his destruction, and his lips are a net for his soul. 18:8 [hgb] 传 舌 人 的 言 语 ， 如 同 美 食 ， 深 入 人 的 心 腹 。 [kjv] The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. [bbe] The words of one who says evil of his neighbour secretly are like sweet food, and go down into the inner parts of the stomach. 18:9 [hgb] 作 工 懈 怠 的 ， 与 浪 费 人 为 弟 兄 。 [kjv] He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster. [bbe] He who does not give his mind to his work is brother to him who makes destruction. 18:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 名 ， 是 坚 固 台 。 义 人 奔 入 ， 便 得 安 稳 。 [kjv] The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. [bbe] The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the upright man running into it is safe. 18:11 [hgb] 富 足 人 的 财 物 ， 是 他 的 坚 城 ， 在 他 心 想 ， 犹 如 高 墙 。 [kjv] The rich man\u0027s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit. [bbe] The property of a man of wealth is his strong town, and it is as a high wall in the thoughts of his heart. 18:12 [hgb] 败 坏 之 先 ， 人 心 骄 傲 。 尊 荣 以 前 ， 必 有 谦 卑 。 [kjv] Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility. [bbe] Before destruction the heart of man is full of pride, and before honour goes a gentle spirit. 18:13 [hgb] 未 曾 听 完 先 回 答 的 ， 便 是 他 的 愚 昧 ， 和 羞 辱 。 [kjv] He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him. [bbe] To give an answer before hearing is a foolish thing and a cause of shame. 18:14 [hgb] 人 有 疾 病 ， 心 能 忍 耐 。 心 灵 忧 伤 ， 谁 能 承 当 呢 ？ [kjv] The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? [bbe] The spirit of a man will be his support when he is ill; but how may a broken spirit be lifted up? 18:15 [hgb] 聪 明 人 的 心 得 知 识 。 智 慧 人 的 耳 求 知 识 。 [kjv] The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. [bbe] The heart of the man of good sense gets knowledge; the ear of the wise is searching for knowledge. 18:16 [hgb] 人 的 礼 物 ， 为 他 开 路 ， 引 他 到 高 位 的 人 面 前 。 [kjv] A man\u0027s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. [bbe] A man\u0027s offering makes room for him, letting him come before great men. 18:17 [hgb] 先 诉 情 由 的 ， 似 乎 有 理 。 但 邻 舍 来 到 ， 就 察 出 实 情 。 [kjv] He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. [bbe] The man who first puts his cause before the judge seems to be in the right; but then his neighbour comes and puts his cause in its true light. 18:18 [hgb] 掣 签 能 止 息 争 竞 ， 也 能 解 散 强 胜 的 人 。 [kjv] The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. [bbe] The decision of chance puts an end to argument, parting the strong. 18:19 [hgb] 弟 兄 结 怨 ， 劝 他 和 好 ， 比 取 坚 固 城 还 难 。 这 样 的 争 竞 ， 如 同 坚 寨 的 门 闩 。 [kjv] A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. [bbe] A brother wounded is like a strong town, and violent acts are like a locked tower. 18:20 [hgb] 人 口 中 所 结 的 果 子 ， 必 充 满 肚 腹 。 他 嘴 所 出 的 ， 必 使 他 饱 足 。 [kjv] A man\u0027s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. [bbe] With the fruit of a man\u0027s mouth his stomach will be full; the produce of his lips will be his in full measure. 18:21 [hgb] 生 死 在 舌 头 的 权 下 。 喜 爱 他 的 ， 必 吃 他 所 结 的 果 子 。 [kjv] Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. [bbe] Death and life are in the power of the tongue; and those to whom it is dear will have its fruit for their food. 18:22 [hgb] 得 着 贤 妻 的 ， 是 得 着 好 处 ， 也 是 蒙 了 耶 和 华 的 恩 惠 。 [kjv] Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD. [bbe] Whoever gets a wife gets a good thing, and has the approval of the Lord. 18:23 [hgb] 贫 穷 人 说 哀 求 的 话 。 富 足 人 用 威 吓 的 话 回 答 。 [kjv] The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. [bbe] The poor man makes requests for grace, but the man of wealth gives a rough answer. 18:24 [hgb] 滥 交 朋 友 的 ， 自 取 败 坏 。 但 有 一 朋 友 ， 比 弟 兄 更 亲 密 。 [kjv] A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. [bbe] There are friends who may be a man\u0027s destruction, but there is a lover who keeps nearer than a brother.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1824.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
