{"id":5532,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"26:1 [hgb] 夏 天 落 雪 ， 收 割 时 下 雨 ， 都 不 相 宜 。 愚 昧 人 得 尊 荣 ， 也 是 如 此 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. \\n\\n [bbe] Like snow in summer and rain when the grain is being cut, so honour is not natural for the foolish. \\n\\n 26:2 [hgb] 麻 雀 往 来 ， 燕 子 翻 飞 ， 这 样 ， 无 故 地 咒 诅 ， 也 必 不 临 到 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. \\n\\n [bbe] As the sparrow in her wandering and the swallow in her flight, so the curse does not come without a cause. \\n\\n 26:3 [hgb] 鞭 子 是 为 打 马 。 辔 头 是 为 勒 驴 。 刑 杖 是 为 打 愚 昧 人 的 背 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool\u0027s back. \\n\\n [bbe] A whip for the horse, a mouth-bit for the ass, and a rod for the back of the foolish. \\n\\n 26:4 [hgb] 不 要 照 愚 昧 人 的 愚 妄 话 回 答 他 ， 恐 怕 你 与 他 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. \\n\\n [bbe] Do not give to the foolish man a foolish answer, or you will be like him. \\n\\n 26:5 [hgb] 要 照 愚 昧 人 的 愚 妄 话 回 答 他 ， 免 得 他 自 以 为 有 智 慧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. \\n\\n [bbe] Give a foolish man a foolish answer, or he will seem wise to himself. \\n\\n 26:6 [hgb] 借 愚 昧 人 手 寄 信 的 ， 是 砍 断 自 己 的 脚 ， 自 受 损 害 。 （ 自 受 原 文 作 喝 ） \\n\\n [kjv] He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. \\n\\n [bbe] He who sends news by the hand of a foolish man is cutting off his feet and drinking in damage. \\n\\n 26:7 [hgb] 瘸 子 的 脚 ， 空 存 无 用 。 箴 言 在 愚 昧 人 的 口 中 ， 也 是 如 此 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. \\n\\n [bbe] The legs of one who has no power of walking are hanging loose; so is a wise saying in the mouth of the foolish. \\n\\n 26:8 [hgb] 将 尊 荣 给 愚 昧 人 的 ， 好 像 人 把 石 子 包 在 机 弦 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. \\n\\n [bbe] Giving honour to a foolish man is like attempting to keep a stone fixed in a cord. \\n\\n 26:9 [hgb] 箴 言 在 愚 昧 人 的 口 中 ， 好 像 荆 棘 刺 入 醉 汉 的 手 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools. \\n\\n [bbe] Like a thorn which goes up into the hand of a man overcome by drink, so is a wise saying in the mouth of a foolish man. \\n\\n 26:10 [hgb] 雇 愚 昧 人 的 ， 与 雇 过 路 人 的 ， 就 像 射 伤 众 人 的 弓 箭 手 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. \\n\\n [bbe] Like an archer wounding all who go by, is a foolish man overcome by drink. \\n\\n 26:11 [hgb] 愚 昧 人 行 愚 妄 事 ， 行 了 又 行 ， 就 如 狗 转 过 来 吃 它 所 吐 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. \\n\\n [bbe] Like a dog going back to the food which he has not been able to keep down, is the foolish man doing his foolish acts over again. \\n\\n 26:12 [hgb] 你 见 自 以 为 有 智 慧 的 人 吗 ？ 愚 昧 人 比 他 更 有 指 望 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him. \\n\\n [bbe] Have you seen a man who seems to himself to be wise? There is more hope for the foolish than for him. \\n\\n 26:13 [hgb] 懒 惰 人 说 ， 道 上 有 猛 狮 ， 街 上 有 壮 狮 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. \\n\\n [bbe] The hater of work says, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. \\n\\n 26:14 [hgb] 门 在 枢 纽 转 动 ， 懒 惰 人 在 床 上 也 是 如 此 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. \\n\\n [bbe] A door is turned on its pillar, and the hater of work on his bed. \\n\\n 26:15 [hgb] 懒 惰 人 放 手 在 盘 子 里 ， 就 是 向 口 撤 回 ， 也 以 为 劳 乏 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. \\n\\n [bbe] The hater of work puts his hand deep into the basin: lifting it again to his mouth is a weariness to him. \\n\\n 26:16 [hgb] 懒 惰 人 看 自 己 ， 比 七 个 善 于 应 对 的 人 更 有 智 慧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. \\n\\n [bbe] The hater of work seems to himself wiser than seven men who are able to give an answer with good sense. \\n\\n 26:17 [hgb] 过 路 被 事 激 动 ， 管 理 不 干 己 的 争 竞 ， 好 像 人 揪 住 狗 耳 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. \\n\\n [bbe] He who gets mixed up in a fight which is not his business, is like one who takes a dog by the ears while it is going by. \\n\\n 26:18 [hgb] 人 欺 凌 邻 舍 ， 却 说 ， 我 岂 不 是 戏 耍 吗 ？ 他 就 像 疯 狂 的 人 ， 抛 掷 火 把 ， 利 箭 ， 与 杀 人 的 兵 器 。 （ 杀 人 的 兵 器 原 文 作 死 亡 ） \\n\\n [kjv] As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, \\n\\n [bbe] As one who is off his head sends about flaming sticks and arrows of death, \\n\\n 26:19 [hgb] \\n\\n [kjv] So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? \\n\\n [bbe] So is the man who gets the better of his neighbour by deceit, and says, Am I not doing so in sport? \\n\\n 26:20 [hgb] 火 缺 了 柴 ， 就 必 熄 灭 。 无 人 传 舌 ， 争 竞 便 止 息 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. \\n\\n [bbe] Without wood, the fire goes out; and where there is no secret talk, argument is ended. \\n\\n 26:21 [hgb] 好 争 竞 的 人 煽 惑 争 端 ， 就 如 余 火 加 炭 ， 火 上 加 柴 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. \\n\\n [bbe] Like breath on coals and wood on fire, so a man given to argument gets a fight started. \\n\\n 26:22 [hgb] 传 舌 人 的 言 语 ， 如 同 美 食 ， 深 入 人 的 心 腹 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. \\n\\n [bbe] The words of one who says evil of his neighbour secretly are like sweet food, they go down into the inner parts of the stomach. \\n\\n 26:23 [hgb] 火 热 的 嘴 ， 奸 恶 的 心 ， 好 像 银 渣 包 的 瓦 器 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. \\n\\n [bbe] Smooth lips and an evil heart are like a vessel of earth plated with silver waste. \\n\\n 26:24 [hgb] 怨 恨 人 的 用 嘴 粉 饰 ， 心 里 却 藏 着 诡 诈 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; \\n\\n [bbe] With his lips the hater makes things seem what they are not, but deceit is stored up inside him; \\n\\n 26:25 [hgb] 他 用 甜 言 蜜 语 ， 你 不 可 信 他 ， 因 为 他 心 中 有 七 样 可 憎 恶 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. \\n\\n [bbe] When he says fair words, have no belief in him; for in his heart are seven evils: \\n\\n 26:26 [hgb] 他 虽 用 诡 诈 遮 掩 自 己 的 怨 恨 ， 他 的 邪 恶 必 在 会 中 显 露 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation. \\n\\n [bbe] Though his hate is covered with deceit, his sin will be seen openly before the meeting of the people. \\n\\n 26:27 [hgb] 挖 陷 坑 的 ， 自 己 必 掉 在 其 中 。 滚 石 头 的 ， 石 头 必 反 滚 在 他 身 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. \\n\\n [bbe] He who makes a hole in the earth will himself go falling into it: and on him by whom a stone is rolled the stone will come back again. \\n\\n 26:28 [hgb] 虚 谎 的 舌 ， 恨 他 所 压 伤 的 人 。 谄 媚 的 口 ， 败 坏 人 的 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. \\n\\n [bbe] A false tongue has hate for those who have clean hearts, and a smooth mouth is a cause of falling. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1832.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
