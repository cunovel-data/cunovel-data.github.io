{"id":5533,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 27","content":"27:1 [hgb] 不 要 为 明 日 自 夸 ， 因 为 一 日 要 生 何 事 ， 你 尚 且 不 能 知 道 。 \n [kjv] Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. \n [bbe] Do not make a noise about tomorrow, for you are not certain what a day\u0027s outcome may be. \n 27:2 [hgb] 要 别 人 夸 奖 你 ， 不 可 用 口 自 夸 。 等 外 人 称 赞 你 ， 不 可 用 嘴 自 称 。 \n [kjv] Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. \n [bbe] Let another man give you praise, and not your mouth; one who is strange to you, and not your lips. \n 27:3 [hgb] 石 头 重 ， 沙 土 沉 ， 愚 妄 人 的 恼 怒 ， 比 这 两 样 更 重 。 \n [kjv] A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool\u0027s wrath is heavier than them both. \n [bbe] A stone has great weight, and sand is crushing; but the wrath of the foolish is of greater weight than these. \n 27:4 [hgb] 忿 怒 为 残 忍 ， 怒 气 为 狂 澜 ， 惟 有 嫉 妒 ， 谁 能 敌 得 住 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy? \n [bbe] Wrath is cruel, and angry feeling an overflowing stream; but who does not give way before envy? \n 27:5 [hgb] 当 面 的 责 备 ， 强 如 背 地 的 爱 情 。 \n [kjv] Open rebuke is better than secret love. \n [bbe] Better is open protest than love kept secret. \n 27:6 [hgb] 朋 友 加 的 伤 痕 ， 出 于 忠 诚 ， 仇 敌 连 连 亲 嘴 ， 却 是 多 余 。 \n [kjv] Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. \n [bbe] The wounds of a friend are given in good faith, but the kisses of a hater are false. \n 27:7 [hgb] 人 吃 饱 了 ， 厌 恶 蜂 房 的 蜜 。 人 饥 饿 了 ， 一 切 苦 物 都 觉 甘 甜 。 \n [kjv] The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. \n [bbe] The full man has no use for honey, but to the man in need of food every bitter thing is sweet. \n 27:8 [hgb] 人 离 本 处 飘 流 ， 好 像 雀 鸟 离 窝 游 飞 。 \n [kjv] As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place. \n [bbe] Like a bird wandering from the place of her eggs is a man wandering from his station. \n 27:9 [hgb] 膏 油 与 香 料 ， 使 人 心 喜 悦 。 朋 友 诚 实 的 劝 教 ， 也 是 如 此 甘 美 。 \n [kjv] Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man\u0027s friend by hearty counsel. \n [bbe] Oil and perfume make glad the heart, and the wise suggestion of a friend is sweet to the soul. \n 27:10 [hgb] 你 的 朋 友 ， 和 父 亲 的 朋 友 ， 你 都 不 可 离 弃 。 你 遭 难 的 日 子 ， 不 要 上 弟 兄 的 家 去 。 相 近 的 邻 舍 ， 强 如 远 方 的 弟 兄 。 \n [kjv] Thine own friend, and thy father\u0027s friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother\u0027s house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. \n [bbe] Do not give up your friend and your father\u0027s friend; and do not go into your brother\u0027s house in the day of your trouble: better is a neighbour who is near than a brother far off. \n 27:11 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 你 要 作 智 慧 人 ， 好 叫 我 的 心 欢 喜 ， 使 我 可 以 回 答 那 讥 诮 我 的 人 。 \n [kjv] My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. \n [bbe] My son, be wise and make my heart glad, so that I may give back an answer to him who puts me to shame. \n 27:12 [hgb] 通 达 人 见 祸 藏 躲 。 愚 蒙 人 前 往 受 害 。 \n [kjv] A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished. \n [bbe] The sharp man sees the evil and takes cover: the simple go straight on and get into trouble. \n 27:13 [hgb] 谁 为 生 人 作 保 ， 就 拿 谁 的 衣 服 。 谁 为 外 女 作 保 ， 谁 就 承 当 。 \n [kjv] Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. \n [bbe] Take a man\u0027s clothing if he makes himself responsible for a strange man, and get an undertaking from him who gives his word for strange men. \n 27:14 [hgb] 清 晨 起 来 ， 大 声 给 朋 友 祝 福 的 ， 就 算 是 咒 诅 他 。 \n [kjv] He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. \n [bbe] He who gives a blessing to his friend with a loud voice, getting up early in the morning, will have it put to his account as a curse. \n 27:15 [hgb] 大 雨 之 日 连 连 滴 漏 ， 和 争 吵 的 妇 人 一 样 。 \n [kjv] A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. \n [bbe] Like an unending dropping on a day of rain is a bitter-tongued woman. \n 27:16 [hgb] 想 拦 阻 她 的 ， 便 是 拦 阻 风 ， 也 是 右 手 抓 油 。 \n [kjv] Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself. \n [bbe] He who keeps secret the secret of his friend, will get himself a name for good faith. \n 27:17 [hgb] 铁 磨 铁 ， 磨 出 刃 来 。 朋 友 相 感 ， （ 原 文 作 磨 朋 友 的 脸 ） 也 是 如 此 。 \n [kjv] Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. \n [bbe] Iron makes iron sharp; so a man makes sharp his friend. \n 27:18 [hgb] 看 守 无 花 果 树 的 ， 必 吃 树 上 的 果 子 。 敬 奉 主 人 的 ， 必 得 尊 荣 。 \n [kjv] Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured. \n [bbe] Whoever keeps a fig-tree will have its fruit; and the servant waiting on his master will be honoured. \n 27:19 [hgb] 水 中 照 脸 ， 彼 此 相 符 。 人 与 人 ， 心 也 相 对 。 \n [kjv] As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. \n [bbe] Like face looking at face in water, so are the hearts of men to one another. \n 27:20 [hgb] 阴 间 和 灭 亡 ， 永 不 满 足 。 人 的 眼 目 ， 也 是 如 此 。 \n [kjv] Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. \n [bbe] The underworld and Abaddon are never full, and the eyes of man have never enough. \n 27:21 [hgb] 鼎 为 炼 银 ， 炉 为 炼 金 ， 人 的 称 赞 也 试 炼 人 。 \n [kjv] As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise. \n [bbe] The heating-pot is for silver and the oven-fire for gold, and a man is measured by what he is praised for. \n 27:22 [hgb] 你 虽 用 杵 ， 将 愚 妄 人 与 打 碎 的 麦 子 一 同 捣 在 臼 中 ， 他 的 愚 妄 还 是 离 不 了 他 。 \n [kjv] Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him. \n [bbe] Even if a foolish man is crushed with a hammer in a vessel among crushed grain, still his foolish ways will not go from him. \n 27:23 [hgb] 你 要 详 细 知 道 你 羊 群 的 景 况 。 留 心 料 理 你 的 牛 群 。 \n [kjv] Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds. \n [bbe] Take care to have knowledge about the condition of your flocks, looking well after your herds; \n 27:24 [hgb] 因 为 赀 财 不 能 永 有 。 冠 冕 岂 能 存 到 万 代 。 \n [kjv] For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation? \n [bbe] For wealth is not for ever, and money does not go on for all generations. \n 27:25 [hgb] 干 草 割 去 ， 嫩 草 发 现 ， 山 上 的 菜 蔬 ， 也 被 收 敛 。 \n [kjv] The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. \n [bbe] The grass comes up and the young grass is seen, and the mountain plants are got in. \n 27:26 [hgb] 羊 羔 之 毛 ， 是 为 你 作 衣 服 。 山 羊 是 为 作 田 地 的 价 值 。 \n [kjv] The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field. \n [bbe] The lambs are for your clothing, and the he-goats make the value of a field: \n 27:27 [hgb] 并 有 母 山 羊 奶 够 你 吃 ， 也 够 你 的 家 眷 吃 ， 且 够 养 你 的 婢 女 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt have goats\u0027 milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens. \n [bbe] There will be goats\u0027 milk enough for your food, and for the support of your servant-girls. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1833.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
