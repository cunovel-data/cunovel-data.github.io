{"id":5523,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"17:1 [hgb] 设 筵 满 屋 ， 大 家 相 争 ， 不 如 有 块 干 饼 ， 大 家 相 安 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife. \\n\\n [bbe] Better a bit of dry bread in peace, than a house full of feasting and violent behaviour. \\n\\n 17:2 [hgb] 仆 人 办 事 聪 明 ， 必 管 辖 贻 羞 之 子 ， 又 在 众 子 中 ， 同 分 产 业 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. \\n\\n [bbe] A servant who does wisely will have rule over a son causing shame, and will have his part in the heritage among brothers. \\n\\n 17:3 [hgb] 鼎 为 炼 银 ， 炉 为 炼 金 。 惟 有 耶 和 华 熬 炼 人 心 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts. \\n\\n [bbe] The heating-pot is for silver and the oven-fire for gold, but the Lord is the tester of hearts. \\n\\n 17:4 [hgb] 行 恶 的 留 心 听 奸 诈 之 言 。 说 谎 的 侧 耳 听 邪 恶 之 语 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. \\n\\n [bbe] A wrongdoer gives attention to evil lips, and a man of deceit gives ear to a damaging tongue. \\n\\n 17:5 [hgb] 戏 笑 穷 人 的 ， 是 辱 没 造 他 的 主 。 幸 灾 乐 祸 的 ， 必 不 免 受 罚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished. \\n\\n [bbe] Whoever makes sport of the poor puts shame on his Maker; and he who is glad because of trouble will not go free from punishment. \\n\\n 17:6 [hgb] 子 孙 为 老 人 的 冠 冕 。 父 亲 是 儿 女 的 荣 耀 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Children\u0027s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers. \\n\\n [bbe] Children\u0027s children are the crown of old men, and the glory of children is their fathers. \\n\\n 17:7 [hgb] 愚 顽 人 说 美 言 本 不 相 宜 ， 何 况 君 王 说 谎 话 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. \\n\\n [bbe] Fair words are not to be looked for from a foolish man, much less are false lips in a ruler. \\n\\n 17:8 [hgb] 贿 赂 在 馈 送 的 人 眼 中 ， 看 为 宝 玉 。 随 处 运 动 ， 都 得 顺 利 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. \\n\\n [bbe] An offering of money is like a stone of great price in the eyes of him who has it: wherever he goes, he does well. \\n\\n 17:9 [hgb] 遮 掩 人 过 的 ， 寻 求 人 爱 。 屡 次 挑 错 的 ， 离 间 密 友 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends. \\n\\n [bbe] He who keeps a sin covered is looking for love; but he who keeps on talking of a thing makes division between friends. \\n\\n 17:10 [hgb] 一 句 责 备 话 ， 深 入 聪 明 人 的 心 ， 强 如 责 打 愚 昧 人 一 百 下 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. \\n\\n [bbe] A word of protest goes deeper into one who has sense than a hundred blows into a foolish man. \\n\\n 17:11 [hgb] 恶 人 只 寻 背 叛 ， 所 以 必 有 严 厉 的 使 者 ， 奉 差 攻 击 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. \\n\\n [bbe] An uncontrolled man is only looking for trouble, so a cruel servant will be sent against him. \\n\\n 17:12 [hgb] 宁 可 遇 见 丢 崽 子 的 母 熊 ， 不 可 遇 见 正 行 愚 妄 的 愚 昧 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. \\n\\n [bbe] It is better to come face to face with a bear whose young ones have been taken away than with a foolish man acting foolishly. \\n\\n 17:13 [hgb] 以 恶 报 善 的 ， 祸 患 必 不 离 他 的 家 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. \\n\\n [bbe] If anyone gives back evil for good, evil will never go away from his house. \\n\\n 17:14 [hgb] 分 争 的 起 头 ， 如 水 放 开 。 所 以 在 争 闹 之 先 ， 必 当 止 息 争 竞 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with. \\n\\n [bbe] The start of fighting is like the letting out of water: so give up before it comes to blows. \\n\\n 17:15 [hgb] 定 恶 人 为 义 的 ， 定 义 人 为 恶 的 ， 这 都 为 耶 和 华 所 憎 恶 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] He who gives a decision for the evil-doer and he who gives a decision against the upright, are equally disgusting to the Lord. \\n\\n 17:16 [hgb] 愚 昧 人 既 无 聪 明 ， 为 何 手 拿 价 银 买 智 慧 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it? \\n\\n [bbe] How will money in the hand of the foolish get him wisdom, seeing that he has no sense? \\n\\n 17:17 [hgb] 朋 友 乃 时 常 亲 爱 。 弟 兄 为 患 难 而 生 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. \\n\\n [bbe] A friend is loving at all times, and becomes a brother in times of trouble. \\n\\n 17:18 [hgb] 在 邻 舍 面 前 击 掌 作 保 ， 乃 是 无 知 的 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend. \\n\\n [bbe] A man without sense gives his hand in an agreement, and makes himself responsible before his neighbour. \\n\\n 17:19 [hgb] 喜 爱 争 竞 的 ， 是 喜 爱 过 犯 。 高 立 家 门 的 ， 乃 自 取 败 坏 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. \\n\\n [bbe] The lover of fighting is a lover of sin: he who makes high his doorway is looking for destruction. \\n\\n 17:20 [hgb] 心 存 邪 僻 的 ， 寻 不 着 好 处 。 舌 弄 是 非 的 ， 陷 在 祸 患 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. \\n\\n [bbe] Nothing good comes to him whose heart is fixed on evil purposes: and he who has an evil tongue will come to trouble. \\n\\n 17:21 [hgb] 生 愚 昧 子 的 ， 必 自 愁 苦 。 愚 顽 人 的 父 ， 毫 无 喜 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy. \\n\\n [bbe] He who has an unwise son gets sorrow for himself, and the father of a foolish son has no joy. \\n\\n 17:22 [hgb] 喜 乐 的 心 ， 乃 是 良 药 。 忧 伤 的 灵 ， 使 骨 枯 干 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. \\n\\n [bbe] A glad heart makes a healthy body, but a crushed spirit makes the bones dry. \\n\\n 17:23 [hgb] 恶 人 暗 中 受 贿 赂 ， 为 要 颠 倒 判 断 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. \\n\\n [bbe] A sinner takes an offering out of his robe, to get a decision for himself in a cause. \\n\\n 17:24 [hgb] 明 哲 人 眼 前 有 智 慧 。 愚 昧 人 眼 望 地 极 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. \\n\\n [bbe] Wisdom is before the face of him who has sense; but the eyes of the foolish are on the ends of the earth. \\n\\n 17:25 [hgb] 愚 昧 子 使 父 亲 愁 烦 ， 使 母 亲 忧 苦 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him. \\n\\n [bbe] A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitter pain to her who gave him birth. \\n\\n 17:26 [hgb] 刑 罚 义 人 为 不 善 。 责 打 君 子 为 不 义 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity. \\n\\n [bbe] To give punishment to the upright is not good, or to give blows to the noble for their righteousness. \\n\\n 17:27 [hgb] 寡 少 言 语 的 有 知 识 。 性 情 温 良 的 有 聪 明 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. \\n\\n [bbe] He who has knowledge says little: and he who has a calm spirit is a man of good sense. \\n\\n 17:28 [hgb] 愚 昧 人 若 静 默 不 言 ， 也 可 算 为 智 慧 。 闭 口 不 说 ， 也 可 算 为 聪 明 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding. \\n\\n [bbe] Even the foolish man, when he keeps quiet, is taken to be wise: when his lips are shut he is credited with good sense. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1823.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
