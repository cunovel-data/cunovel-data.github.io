{"id":5536,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"30:1 [hgb] 雅 基 的 儿 子 亚 古 珥 的 言 语 ， 就 是 真 言 。 这 人 对 以 铁 和 乌 甲 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, \\n\\n [bbe] The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh, from Massa. The man says: I am full of weariness, O God, I am full of weariness; O God, I have come to an end: \\n\\n 30:2 [hgb] 我 比 众 人 更 蠢 笨 ， 也 没 有 人 的 聪 明 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man. \\n\\n [bbe] For I am more like a beast than any man, I have no power of reasoning like a man: \\n\\n 30:3 [hgb] 我 没 有 学 好 智 慧 。 也 不 认 识 至 圣 者 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. \\n\\n [bbe] I have not got wisdom by teaching, so that I might have the knowledge of the Holy One. \\n\\n 30:4 [hgb] 谁 升 天 又 降 下 来 ？ 谁 聚 风 在 掌 握 中 ？ 谁 包 水 在 衣 服 里 ？ 谁 立 定 地 的 四 极 ？ 他 名 叫 什 么 ？ 他 儿 子 名 叫 什 么 ？ 你 知 道 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son\u0027s name, if thou canst tell? \\n\\n [bbe] Who has gone up to heaven and come down? who has taken the winds in his hands, prisoning the waters in his robe? by whom have all the ends of the earth been fixed? what is his name, and what is his son\u0027s name, if you are able to say? \\n\\n 30:5 [hgb] 神 的 言 语 ， 句 句 都 是 炼 净 的 ， 投 靠 他 的 ， 他 便 作 他 们 的 盾 牌 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. \\n\\n [bbe] Every word of God is tested: he is a breastplate to those who put their faith in him. \\n\\n 30:6 [hgb] 他 的 言 语 ， 你 不 可 加 添 。 恐 怕 他 责 备 你 ， 你 就 显 为 说 谎 言 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. \\n\\n [bbe] Make no addition to his words, or he will make clear your error, and you will be seen to be false. \\n\\n 30:7 [hgb] 我 求 你 两 件 事 ， 在 我 未 死 之 先 ， 不 要 不 赐 给 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: \\n\\n [bbe] I have made request to you for two things; do not keep them from me before my death: \\n\\n 30:8 [hgb] 求 你 使 虚 假 和 谎 言 远 离 我 。 使 我 也 不 贫 穷 ， 也 不 富 足 ， 赐 给 我 需 用 的 饮 食 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: \\n\\n [bbe] Put far from me all false and foolish things: do not give me great wealth or let me be in need, but give me only enough food: \\n\\n 30:9 [hgb] 恐 怕 我 饱 足 不 认 你 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 是 谁 呢 ？ 又 恐 怕 我 贫 穷 就 偷 窃 ， 以 致 亵 渎 我 神 的 名 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain. \\n\\n [bbe] For fear that if I am full, I may be false to you and say, Who is the Lord? or if I am poor, I may become a thief, using the name of my God wrongly. \\n\\n 30:10 [hgb] 你 不 要 向 主 人 谗 谤 仆 人 。 恐 怕 他 咒 诅 你 ， 你 便 算 为 有 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. \\n\\n [bbe] Do not say evil of a servant to his master, or he will put a curse on you, and you will get into trouble. \\n\\n 30:11 [hgb] 有 一 宗 人 ， （ 宗 原 文 作 代 下 同 ） 咒 诅 父 亲 ， 不 给 母 亲 祝 福 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. \\n\\n [bbe] There is a generation who put a curse on their father, and do not give a blessing to their mother. \\n\\n 30:12 [hgb] 有 一 宗 人 ， 自 以 为 清 洁 ， 却 没 有 洗 去 自 己 的 污 秽 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness. \\n\\n [bbe] There is a generation who seem to themselves to be free from sin, but are not washed from their unclean ways. \\n\\n 30:13 [hgb] 有 一 宗 人 ， 眼 目 何 其 高 傲 ， 眼 皮 也 是 高 举 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. \\n\\n [bbe] There is a generation, O how full of pride are their eyes! O how their brows are lifted up! \\n\\n 30:14 [hgb] 有 一 宗 人 ， 牙 如 剑 ， 齿 如 刀 ， 要 吞 灭 地 上 的 困 苦 人 ， 和 世 间 的 穷 乏 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men. \\n\\n [bbe] There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, their strong teeth like knives, for the destruction of the poor from the earth, and of those who are in need from among men. \\n\\n 30:15 [hgb] 蚂 蟥 有 两 个 女 儿 ， 常 说 ， 给 呀 给 呀 。 有 三 样 不 知 足 的 ， 连 不 说 够 的 共 有 四 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough: \\n\\n [bbe] The night-spirit has two daughters, Give, give. There are three things which are never full, even four which never say, Enough: \\n\\n 30:16 [hgb] 就 是 阴 间 ， 和 石 胎 ， 浸 水 不 足 的 地 ， 并 火 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough. \\n\\n [bbe] The underworld, and the woman without a child; the earth which never has enough water, and the fire which never says, Enough. \\n\\n 30:17 [hgb] 戏 笑 父 亲 ， 藐 视 而 不 听 从 母 亲 的 ， 他 的 眼 睛 ， 必 为 谷 中 的 乌 鸦 啄 出 来 ， 为 鹰 雏 所 吃 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. \\n\\n [bbe] The eye which makes sport of a father, and sees no value in a mother when she is old will be rooted out by the ravens of the valley, and be food for the young eagles. \\n\\n 30:18 [hgb] 我 所 测 不 透 的 奇 妙 有 三 样 ， 连 我 所 不 知 道 的 共 有 四 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: \\n\\n [bbe] There are three things, the wonder of which overcomes me, even four things outside my knowledge: \\n\\n 30:19 [hgb] 就 是 鹰 在 空 中 飞 的 道 ， 蛇 在 磐 石 上 爬 的 道 ， 船 在 海 中 行 的 道 ， 男 与 女 交 合 的 道 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. \\n\\n [bbe] The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a snake on a rock; the way of a ship in the heart of the sea; and the way of a man with a girl. \\n\\n 30:20 [hgb] 淫 妇 的 道 ， 也 是 这 样 ， 她 吃 了 把 嘴 一 擦 ， 就 说 ， 我 没 有 行 恶 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. \\n\\n [bbe] This is the way of a false wife; she takes food, and, cleaning her mouth, says, I have done no wrong. \\n\\n 30:21 [hgb] 使 地 震 动 的 有 三 样 ， 连 地 担 不 起 的 共 有 四 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear: \\n\\n [bbe] For three things the earth is moved, and there are four which it will not put up with: \\n\\n 30:22 [hgb] 就 是 仆 人 作 王 。 愚 顽 人 吃 饱 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; \\n\\n [bbe] A servant when he becomes a king; a man without sense when his wealth is increased; \\n\\n 30:23 [hgb] 丑 恶 的 女 子 出 嫁 。 婢 女 接 续 主 母 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress. \\n\\n [bbe] A hated woman when she is married; and a servant-girl who takes the place of her master\u0027s wife. \\n\\n 30:24 [hgb] 地 上 有 四 样 小 物 ， 却 甚 聪 明 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise: \\n\\n [bbe] There are four things which are little on the earth, but they are very wise: \\n\\n 30:25 [hgb] 蚂 蚁 是 无 力 之 类 ， 却 在 夏 天 预 备 粮 食 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; \\n\\n [bbe] The ants are a people not strong, but they put by a store of food in the summer; \\n\\n 30:26 [hgb] 沙 番 是 软 弱 之 类 ， 却 在 磐 石 中 造 房 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; \\n\\n [bbe] The conies are only a feeble people, but they make their houses in the rocks; \\n\\n 30:27 [hgb] 蝗 虫 没 有 君 王 ， 却 分 队 而 出 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; \\n\\n [bbe] The locusts have no king, but they all go out in bands; \\n\\n 30:28 [hgb] 守 宫 用 爪 抓 墙 ， 却 住 在 王 宫 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings\u0027 palaces. \\n\\n [bbe] You may take the lizard in your hands, but it is in kings\u0027 houses. \\n\\n 30:29 [hgb] 步 行 威 武 的 有 三 样 ， 连 行 走 威 武 的 共 有 四 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going: \\n\\n [bbe] There are three things whose steps are good to see, even four whose goings are fair: \\n\\n 30:30 [hgb] 就 是 狮 子 乃 百 兽 中 最 为 猛 烈 ， 无 所 躲 避 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; \\n\\n [bbe] The lion, which is strongest among beasts, not turning from his way for any; \\n\\n 30:31 [hgb] 猎 狗 ， 公 山 羊 ， 和 无 人 能 敌 的 君 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up. \\n\\n [bbe] The war-horse, and the he-goat, and the king when his army is with him. \\n\\n 30:32 [hgb] 你 若 行 事 愚 顽 ， 自 高 自 傲 ， 或 是 怀 了 恶 念 ， 就 当 用 手 捂 口 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth. \\n\\n [bbe] If you have done foolishly in lifting yourself up, or if you have had evil designs, put your hand over your mouth. \\n\\n 30:33 [hgb] 摇 牛 奶 必 成 奶 油 。 扭 鼻 子 必 出 血 。 照 样 ， 激 动 怒 气 必 起 争 端 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. \\n\\n [bbe] The shaking of milk makes butter, and the twisting of the nose makes blood come: so the forcing of wrath is a cause of fighting. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1836.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
