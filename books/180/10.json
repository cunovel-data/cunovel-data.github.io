{"id":5516,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"10:1 [hgb] 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 智 慧 之 子 ， 使 父 亲 欢 乐 。 愚 昧 之 子 ， 叫 母 亲 担 忧 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. [bbe] A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother. 10:2 [hgb] 不 义 之 财 ， 毫 无 益 处 。 惟 有 公 义 ， 能 救 人 脱 离 死 亡 。 [kjv] Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. [bbe] Wealth which comes from sin is of no profit, but righteousness gives salvation from death. 10:3 [hgb] 耶 和 华 不 使 义 人 受 饥 饿 。 恶 人 所 欲 的 他 必 推 开 。 [kjv] The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. [bbe] The Lord will not let the upright be in need of food, but he puts far from him the desire of the evil-doers. 10:4 [hgb] 手 懒 的 要 受 贫 穷 。 手 勤 的 却 要 富 足 。 [kjv] He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. [bbe] He who is slow in his work becomes poor, but the hand of the ready worker gets in wealth. 10:5 [hgb] 夏 天 聚 敛 的 ， 是 智 慧 之 子 。 收 割 时 沉 睡 的 ， 是 贻 羞 之 子 。 [kjv] He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. [bbe] He who in summer gets together his store is a son who does wisely; but he who takes his rest when the grain is being cut is a son causing shame. 10:6 [hgb] 福 祉 临 到 义 人 的 头 。 强 暴 蒙 蔽 恶 人 的 口 。 [kjv] Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. [bbe] Blessings are on the head of the upright, but the face of sinners will be covered with sorrow. 10:7 [hgb] 义 人 的 纪 念 被 称 赞 。 恶 人 的 名 字 必 朽 烂 。 [kjv] The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot. [bbe] The memory of the upright is a blessing, but the name of the evil-doer will be turned to dust. 10:8 [hgb] 心 中 智 慧 的 ， 必 受 命 令 。 口 里 愚 妄 的 ， 必 致 倾 倒 。 [kjv] The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. [bbe] The wise-hearted man will let himself be ruled, but the man whose talk is foolish will have a fall. 10:9 [hgb] 行 正 直 路 的 ， 步 步 安 稳 。 走 弯 曲 道 的 ， 必 致 败 露 。 [kjv] He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. [bbe] He whose ways are upright will go safely, but he whose ways are twisted will be made low. 10:10 [hgb] 以 眼 传 神 的 ， 使 人 忧 患 。 口 里 愚 妄 的 ， 必 致 倾 倒 。 [kjv] He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall. [bbe] He who makes signs with his eyes is a cause of trouble, but he who makes a man see his errors is a cause of peace. 10:11 [hgb] 义 人 的 口 是 生 命 的 泉 源 。 强 暴 蒙 蔽 恶 人 的 口 。 [kjv] The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. [bbe] The mouth of the upright man is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the evil-doer is a bitter cup. 10:12 [hgb] 恨 能 挑 启 争 端 。 爱 能 遮 掩 一 切 过 错 。 [kjv] Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins. [bbe] Hate is a cause of violent acts, but all errors are covered up by love. 10:13 [hgb] 明 哲 人 嘴 里 有 智 慧 。 无 知 人 背 上 受 刑 杖 。 [kjv] In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. [bbe] In the lips of him who has knowledge wisdom is seen; but a rod is ready for the back of him who is without sense. 10:14 [hgb] 智 慧 人 积 存 知 识 。 愚 妄 人 的 口 速 致 败 坏 。 [kjv] Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction. [bbe] Knowledge is stored up by the wise, but the mouth of the foolish man is a destruction which is near. 10:15 [hgb] 富 户 的 财 物 ， 是 他 的 坚 城 。 穷 人 的 贫 乏 ， 是 他 的 败 坏 。 [kjv] The rich man\u0027s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty. [bbe] The property of the man of wealth is his strong town: the poor man\u0027s need is his destruction. 10:16 [hgb] 义 人 的 勤 劳 致 生 。 恶 人 的 进 项 致 死 。 （ 死 原 文 作 罪 ） [kjv] The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin. [bbe] The work of the upright gives life: the increase of the evil-doer is a cause of sin. 10:17 [hgb] 谨 守 训 诲 的 ， 乃 在 生 命 的 道 上 。 违 弃 责 备 的 ， 便 失 迷 了 路 。 [kjv] He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth. [bbe] He who takes note of teaching is a way of life, but he who gives up training is a cause of error. 10:18 [hgb] 隐 藏 怨 恨 的 ， 有 说 谎 的 嘴 。 口 出 谗 谤 的 ， 是 愚 妄 的 人 。 [kjv] He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool. [bbe] Hate is covered up by the lips of the upright man, but he who lets out evil about another is foolish. 10:19 [hgb] 多 言 多 语 难 免 有 过 。 禁 止 嘴 唇 是 有 智 慧 。 [kjv] In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise. [bbe] Where there is much talk there will be no end to sin, but he who keeps his mouth shut does wisely. 10:20 [hgb] 义 人 的 舌 ， 乃 似 高 银 。 恶 人 的 心 ， 所 值 无 几 。 [kjv] The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. [bbe] The tongue of the upright man is like tested silver: the heart of the evil-doer is of little value. 10:21 [hgb] 义 人 的 口 教 养 多 人 。 愚 昧 人 因 无 知 而 死 亡 。 [kjv] The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom. [bbe] The lips of the upright man give food to men, but the foolish come to death for need of sense. 10:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 所 赐 的 福 ， 使 人 富 足 。 并 不 加 上 忧 虑 。 [kjv] The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. [bbe] The blessing of the Lord gives wealth: hard work makes it no greater. 10:23 [hgb] 愚 妄 人 以 行 恶 为 戏 耍 。 明 哲 人 却 以 智 慧 为 乐 。 [kjv] It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom. [bbe] It is sport to the foolish man to do evil, but the man of good sense takes delight in wisdom. 10:24 [hgb] 恶 人 所 怕 的 必 临 到 他 。 义 人 所 愿 的 必 蒙 应 允 。 [kjv] The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted. [bbe] The thing feared by the evil-doer will come to him, but the upright man will get his desire. 10:25 [hgb] 暴 风 一 过 ， 恶 人 归 于 无 有 。 义 人 的 根 基 却 是 永 久 。 [kjv] As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. [bbe] When the storm-wind is past, the sinner is seen no longer, but the upright man is safe for ever. 10:26 [hgb] 懒 惰 人 叫 差 他 的 人 ， 如 醋 倒 牙 ， 如 烟 薰 目 。 [kjv] As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him. [bbe] Like acid drink to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes, so is the hater of work to those who send him. 10:27 [hgb] 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 使 人 日 子 加 多 。 但 恶 人 的 年 岁 必 被 减 少 。 [kjv] The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. [bbe] The fear of the Lord gives long life, but the years of the evil-doer will be cut short. 10:28 [hgb] 义 人 的 盼 望 ， 必 得 喜 乐 。 恶 人 的 指 望 ， 必 至 灭 没 。 [kjv] The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. [bbe] The hope of the upright man will give joy, but the waiting of the evil-doer will have its end in sorrow. 10:29 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 道 ， 是 正 直 人 的 保 障 。 却 成 了 作 孽 人 的 败 坏 。 [kjv] The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. [bbe] The way of the Lord is a strong tower for the upright man, but destruction to the workers of evil. 10:30 [hgb] 义 人 永 不 挪 移 。 恶 人 不 得 住 在 地 上 。 [kjv] The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth. [bbe] The upright man will never be moved, but evil-doers will not have a safe resting-place in the land. 10:31 [hgb] 义 人 的 口 ， 滋 生 智 慧 。 乖 谬 的 舌 ， 必 被 割 断 。 [kjv] The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out. [bbe] The mouth of the upright man is budding with wisdom, but the twisted tongue will be cut off. 10:32 [hgb] 义 人 的 嘴 ， 能 令 人 喜 悦 。 恶 人 的 口 ， 说 乖 谬 的 话 。 [kjv] The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness. [bbe] The lips of the upright man have knowledge of what is pleasing, but twisted are the mouths of evil-doers.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1816.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
