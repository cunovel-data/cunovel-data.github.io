{"id":5521,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"15:1 [hgb] 回 答 柔 和 ， 使 怒 消 退 。 言 语 暴 戾 ， 触 动 怒 气 。 [kjv] A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger. [bbe] By a soft answer wrath is turned away, but a bitter word is a cause of angry feelings. 15:2 [hgb] 智 慧 人 的 舌 ， 善 发 知 识 。 愚 昧 人 的 口 ， 吐 出 愚 昧 。 [kjv] The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness. [bbe] Knowledge is dropping from the tongue of the wise; but from the mouth of the foolish comes a stream of foolish words. 15:3 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 眼 目 ， 无 处 不 在 。 恶 人 善 人 ， 他 都 鉴 察 。 [kjv] The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. [bbe] The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good. 15:4 [hgb] 温 良 的 舌 ， 是 生 命 树 。 乖 谬 的 嘴 ， 使 人 心 碎 。 [kjv] A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit. [bbe] A comforting tongue is a tree of life, but a twisted tongue is a crushing of the spirit. 15:5 [hgb] 愚 妄 人 藐 视 父 亲 的 管 教 。 领 受 责 备 的 ， 得 着 见 识 。 [kjv] A fool despiseth his father\u0027s instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent. [bbe] A foolish man puts no value on his father\u0027s training; but he who has respect for teaching has good sense. 15:6 [hgb] 义 人 家 中 ， 多 有 财 宝 。 恶 人 得 利 ， 反 受 扰 害 。 [kjv] In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. [bbe] In the house of the upright man there is a great store of wealth; but in the profits of the sinner there is trouble. 15:7 [hgb] 智 慧 人 的 嘴 ， 播 扬 知 识 。 愚 昧 人 的 心 ， 并 不 如 此 。 [kjv] The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so. [bbe] The lips of the wise keep knowledge, but the heart of the foolish man is not right. 15:8 [hgb] 恶 人 献 祭 ， 为 耶 和 华 所 憎 恶 。 正 直 人 祈 祷 ， 为 他 所 喜 悦 。 [kjv] The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight. [bbe] The offering of the evil-doer is disgusting to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright man is his delight. 15:9 [hgb] 恶 人 的 道 路 ， 为 耶 和 华 所 憎 恶 。 追 求 公 义 的 ， 为 他 所 喜 爱 。 [kjv] The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. [bbe] The way of the evil-doer is disgusting to the Lord, but he who goes after righteousness is dear to him. 15:10 [hgb] 舍 弃 正 路 的 ， 必 受 严 刑 。 恨 恶 责 备 的 ， 必 致 死 亡 。 [kjv] Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die. [bbe] There is bitter punishment for him who is turned from the way; and death will be the fate of the hater of teaching. 15:11 [hgb] 阴 间 和 灭 亡 ， 尚 在 耶 和 华 眼 前 ， 何 况 世 人 的 心 呢 ？ [kjv] Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men? [bbe] Before the Lord are the underworld and destruction: how much more, then, the hearts of the children of men! 15:12 [hgb] 亵 慢 人 不 爱 受 责 备 。 他 也 不 就 近 智 慧 人 。 [kjv] A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise. [bbe] The hater of authority has no love for teaching: he will not go to the wise. 15:13 [hgb] 心 中 喜 乐 ， 面 带 笑 容 。 心 里 忧 愁 ， 灵 被 损 伤 。 [kjv] A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. [bbe] A glad heart makes a shining face, but by the sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. 15:14 [hgb] 聪 明 人 心 求 知 识 。 愚 昧 人 口 吃 愚 昧 。 [kjv] The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness. [bbe] The heart of the man of good sense goes in search of knowledge, but foolish things are the food of the unwise. 15:15 [hgb] 困 苦 人 的 日 子 ， 都 是 愁 苦 。 心 中 欢 畅 的 ， 常 享 丰 筵 。 [kjv] All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast. [bbe] All the days of the troubled are evil; but he whose heart is glad has an unending feast. 15:16 [hgb] 少 有 财 宝 ， 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 强 如 多 有 财 宝 ， 烦 乱 不 安 。 [kjv] Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith. [bbe] Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great wealth together with trouble. 15:17 [hgb] 吃 素 菜 ， 彼 此 相 爱 ， 强 如 吃 肥 牛 ， 彼 此 相 恨 。 [kjv] Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. [bbe] Better is a simple meal where love is, than a fat ox and hate with it. 15:18 [hgb] 暴 怒 的 人 ， 挑 启 争 端 。 忍 怒 的 人 ， 止 息 分 争 。 [kjv] A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife. [bbe] An angry man makes men come to blows, but he who is slow to get angry puts an end to fighting. 15:19 [hgb] 懒 惰 人 的 道 ， 像 荆 棘 的 篱 笆 。 正 直 人 的 路 ， 是 平 坦 的 大 道 。 [kjv] The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain. [bbe] Thorns are round the way of the hater of work; but the road of the hard worker becomes a highway. 15:20 [hgb] 智 慧 子 使 父 亲 喜 乐 。 愚 昧 人 藐 视 母 亲 。 [kjv] A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother. [bbe] A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish man has no respect for his mother. 15:21 [hgb] 无 知 的 人 ， 以 愚 妄 为 乐 。 聪 明 的 人 ， 按 正 直 而 行 。 [kjv] Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly. [bbe] Foolish behaviour is joy to the unwise; but a man of good sense makes his way straight. 15:22 [hgb] 不 先 商 议 ， 所 谋 无 效 。 谋 士 众 多 ， 所 谋 乃 成 。 [kjv] Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established. [bbe] Where there are no wise suggestions, purposes come to nothing; but by a number of wise guides they are made certain. 15:23 [hgb] 口 善 应 对 ， 自 觉 喜 乐 。 话 合 其 时 ， 何 等 美 好 。 [kjv] A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it! [bbe] A man has joy in the answer of his mouth: and a word at the right time, how good it is! 15:24 [hgb] 智 慧 人 从 生 命 的 道 上 升 ， 使 他 远 离 在 下 的 阴 间 。 [kjv] The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath. [bbe] Acting wisely is the way of life, guiding a man away from the underworld. 15:25 [hgb] 耶 和 华 必 拆 毁 骄 傲 人 的 家 。 却 要 立 定 寡 妇 的 地 界 。 [kjv] The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow. [bbe] The house of the man of pride will be uprooted by the Lord, but he will make safe the heritage of the widow. 15:26 [hgb] 恶 谋 为 耶 和 华 所 憎 恶 。 良 言 乃 为 纯 净 。 [kjv] The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words. [bbe] Evil designs are disgusting to the Lord, but the words of the clean-hearted are pleasing. 15:27 [hgb] 贪 恋 财 利 的 ， 扰 害 己 家 。 恨 恶 贿 赂 的 ， 必 得 存 活 。 [kjv] He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live. [bbe] He whose desires are fixed on profit is a cause of trouble to his family; but he who has no desire for offerings will have life. 15:28 [hgb] 义 人 的 心 ， 思 量 如 何 回 答 。 恶 人 的 口 ， 吐 出 恶 言 。 [kjv] The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. [bbe] The heart of the upright gives thought to his answer; but from the mouth of the evil-doer comes a stream of evil things. 15:29 [hgb] 耶 和 华 远 离 恶 人 。 却 听 义 人 的 祷 告 。 [kjv] The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous. [bbe] The Lord is far from sinners, but his ear is open to the prayer of the upright. 15:30 [hgb] 眼 有 光 使 心 喜 乐 。 好 信 息 使 骨 滋 润 。 [kjv] The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat. [bbe] The light of the eyes is a joy to the heart, and good news makes the bones fat. 15:31 [hgb] 听 从 生 命 责 备 的 ， 必 常 在 智 慧 人 中 。 [kjv] The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. [bbe] The man whose ear is open to the teaching of life will have his place among the wise. 15:32 [hgb] 弃 绝 管 教 的 ， 轻 看 自 己 的 生 命 。 听 从 责 备 的 ， 却 得 智 慧 。 [kjv] He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding. [bbe] He who will not be controlled by training has no respect for his soul, but he who gives ear to teaching will get wisdom. 15:33 [hgb] 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 是 智 慧 的 训 诲 。 尊 荣 以 前 ， 必 有 谦 卑 。 [kjv] The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility. [bbe] The fear of the Lord is the teaching of wisdom; and a low opinion of oneself goes before honour.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1821.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
