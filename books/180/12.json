{"id":5518,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"12:1 [hgb] 喜 爱 管 教 的 ， 就 是 喜 爱 知 识 。 恨 恶 责 备 的 ， 却 是 畜 类 。 [kjv] Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish. [bbe] A lover of training is a lover of knowledge; but a hater of teaching is like a beast. 12:2 [hgb] 善 人 必 蒙 耶 和 华 的 恩 惠 。 设 诡 计 的 人 ， 耶 和 华 必 定 他 的 罪 。 [kjv] A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn. [bbe] A good man has grace in the eyes of the Lord; but the man of evil designs gets punishment from him. 12:3 [hgb] 人 靠 恶 行 不 能 坚 立 。 义 人 的 根 ， 必 不 动 摇 。 [kjv] A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. [bbe] No man will make himself safe through evil-doing; but the root of upright men will never be moved. 12:4 [hgb] 才 德 的 妇 人 ， 是 丈 夫 的 冠 冕 。 贻 羞 的 妇 人 ， 如 同 朽 烂 在 她 丈 夫 的 骨 中 。 [kjv] A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones. [bbe] A woman of virtue is a crown to her husband; but she whose behaviour is a cause of shame is like a wasting disease in his bones. 12:5 [hgb] 义 人 的 思 念 是 公 平 。 恶 人 的 计 谋 是 诡 诈 。 [kjv] The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit. [bbe] The purposes of upright men are right, but the designs of evil-doers are deceit. 12:6 [hgb] 恶 人 的 言 论 ， 是 埋 伏 流 人 的 血 。 正 直 人 的 口 ， 必 拯 救 人 。 [kjv] The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. [bbe] The words of sinners are destruction for the upright; but the mouth of upright men is their salvation. 12:7 [hgb] 恶 人 倾 覆 ， 归 于 无 有 。 义 人 的 家 ， 必 站 得 住 。 [kjv] The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand. [bbe] Evil-doers are overturned and never seen again, but the house of upright men will keep its place. 12:8 [hgb] 人 必 按 自 己 的 智 慧 被 称 赞 。 心 中 乖 谬 的 ， 必 被 藐 视 。 [kjv] A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. [bbe] A man will be praised in the measure of his wisdom, but a wrong-minded man will be looked down on. 12:9 [hgb] 被 人 轻 贱 ， 却 有 仆 人 ， 强 如 自 尊 ， 缺 少 食 物 。 [kjv] He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread. [bbe] He who is of low position and has a servant, is better than one who has a high opinion of himself and is in need of bread. 12:10 [hgb] 义 人 顾 惜 他 牲 畜 的 命 。 恶 人 的 怜 悯 ， 也 是 残 忍 。 [kjv] A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. [bbe] An upright man has thought for the life of his beast, but the hearts of evil-doers are cruel. 12:11 [hgb] 耕 种 自 己 田 地 的 ， 必 得 饱 食 。 追 随 虚 浮 的 ， 却 是 无 知 。 [kjv] He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding. [bbe] He who does work on his land will not be short of bread; but he who goes after foolish men is without sense. 12:12 [hgb] 恶 人 想 得 坏 人 的 网 罗 。 义 人 的 根 ， 得 以 结 实 。 [kjv] The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit. [bbe] The resting-place of the sinner will come to destruction, but the root of upright men is for ever. 12:13 [hgb] 恶 人 嘴 中 的 过 错 ， 是 自 己 的 网 罗 。 但 义 人 必 脱 离 患 难 。 [kjv] The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble. [bbe] In the sin of the lips is a net which takes the sinner, but the upright man will come out of trouble. 12:14 [hgb] 人 因 口 所 结 的 果 子 ， 必 饱 得 美 福 。 人 手 所 作 的 ， 必 为 自 己 的 报 应 。 [kjv] A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man\u0027s hands shall be rendered unto him. [bbe] From the fruit of his mouth will a man have good food in full measure, and the work of a man\u0027s hands will be rewarded. 12:15 [hgb] 愚 妄 人 所 行 的 ， 在 自 己 眼 中 看 为 正 直 。 惟 智 慧 人 ， 肯 听 人 的 劝 教 。 [kjv] The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise. [bbe] The way of the foolish man seems right to him? but the wise man gives ear to suggestions. 12:16 [hgb] 愚 妄 人 的 恼 怒 ， 立 时 显 露 。 通 达 人 能 忍 辱 藏 羞 。 [kjv] A fool\u0027s wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame. [bbe] A foolish man lets his trouble be openly seen, but a sharp man keeps shame secret. 12:17 [hgb] 说 出 真 话 的 ， 显 明 公 义 。 作 假 见 证 的 ， 显 出 诡 诈 。 [kjv] He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit. [bbe] The breathing out of true words gives knowledge of righteousness; but a false witness gives out deceit. 12:18 [hgb] 说 话 浮 躁 的 ， 如 刀 刺 人 。 智 慧 人 的 舌 头 ， 却 为 医 人 的 良 药 。 [kjv] There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health. [bbe] There are some whose uncontrolled talk is like the wounds of a sword, but the tongue of the wise makes one well again. 12:19 [hgb] 口 吐 真 言 ， 永 远 坚 立 。 舌 说 谎 话 ， 只 存 片 时 。 [kjv] The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment. [bbe] True lips are certain for ever, but a false tongue is only for a minute. 12:20 [hgb] 图 谋 恶 事 的 ， 心 存 诡 诈 。 劝 人 和 睦 的 ， 便 得 喜 乐 。 [kjv] Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy. [bbe] Deceit is in the heart of those whose designs are evil, but for those purposing peace there is joy. 12:21 [hgb] 义 人 不 遭 灾 害 恶 人 满 受 祸 患 。 [kjv] There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief. [bbe] No trouble will come to upright men, but sinners will be full of evil. 12:22 [hgb] 说 谎 言 的 嘴 ， 为 耶 和 华 所 憎 恶 。 行 事 诚 实 的 ， 为 他 所 喜 悦 。 [kjv] Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight. [bbe] False lips are hated by the Lord, but those whose acts are true are his delight. 12:23 [hgb] 通 达 人 隐 藏 知 识 。 愚 昧 人 的 心 ， 彰 显 愚 昧 。 [kjv] A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. [bbe] A sharp man keeps back his knowledge; but the heart of foolish men makes clear their foolish thoughts. 12:24 [hgb] 殷 勤 人 的 手 必 掌 权 。 懒 惰 的 人 必 服 苦 。 [kjv] The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute. [bbe] The hand of the ready worker will have authority, but he who is slow in his work will be put to forced work. 12:25 [hgb] 人 心 忧 虑 ， 屈 而 不 伸 。 一 句 良 言 ， 使 心 欢 乐 。 [kjv] Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad. [bbe] Care in the heart of a man makes it weighted down, but a good word makes it glad. 12:26 [hgb] 义 人 引 导 他 的 邻 舍 。 恶 人 的 道 ， 叫 人 失 迷 。 [kjv] The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them. [bbe] The upright man is a guide to his neighbour, but the way of evil-doers is a cause of error to them. 12:27 [hgb] 懒 惰 的 人 ， 不 烤 打 猎 所 得 的 。 殷 勤 的 人 ， 却 得 宝 贵 的 财 物 。 [kjv] The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious. [bbe] He who is slow in his work does not go in search of food; but the ready worker gets much wealth. 12:28 [hgb] 在 公 义 的 道 上 有 生 命 。 其 路 之 中 ， 并 无 死 亡 。 [kjv] In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death. [bbe] In the road of righteousness is life, but the way of the evil-doer goes to death.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1818.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
