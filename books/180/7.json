{"id":5513,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"7:1 [hgb] 我 儿 ， 你 要 遵 守 我 的 言 语 ， 将 我 的 命 令 存 记 在 心 。 \n [kjv] My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. \n [bbe] My son, keep my sayings, and let my rules be stored up with you. \n 7:2 [hgb] 遵 守 我 的 命 令 ， 就 得 存 活 。 保 守 我 的 法 则 ， （ 或 作 指 教 ） 好 像 保 守 眼 中 的 瞳 人 。 \n [kjv] Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. \n [bbe] Keep my rules and you will have life; let my teaching be to you as the light of your eyes; \n 7:3 [hgb] 系 在 你 指 头 上 ， 刻 在 你 心 版 上 。 \n [kjv] Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. \n [bbe] Let them be fixed to your fingers, and recorded in your heart. \n 7:4 [hgb] 对 智 慧 说 ， 你 是 我 的 姊 妹 。 称 呼 聪 明 为 你 的 亲 人 。 \n [kjv] Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: \n [bbe] Say to wisdom, You are my sister; let knowledge be named your special friend: \n 7:5 [hgb] 他 就 保 你 远 离 淫 妇 ， 远 离 说 谄 媚 话 的 外 女 。 \n [kjv] That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words. \n [bbe] So that they may keep you from the strange woman, even from her whose words are smooth. \n 7:6 [hgb] 我 曾 在 我 房 屋 的 窗 户 内 ， 从 我 窗 棂 之 间 ， 往 外 观 看 。 \n [kjv] For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, \n [bbe] Looking out from my house, and watching through the window, \n 7:7 [hgb] 见 愚 蒙 人 内 ， 少 年 人 中 ， 分 明 有 一 个 无 知 的 少 年 人 ， \n [kjv] And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, \n [bbe] I saw among the young men one without sense, \n 7:8 [hgb] 从 街 上 经 过 ， 走 近 淫 妇 的 巷 口 ， 直 往 通 她 家 的 路 去 ， \n [kjv] Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, \n [bbe] Walking in the street near the turn of her road, going on the way to her house, \n 7:9 [hgb] 在 黄 昏 ， 或 晚 上 ， 或 半 夜 ， 或 黑 暗 之 中 ， \n [kjv] In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: \n [bbe] At nightfall, in the evening of the day, in the black dark of the night. \n 7:10 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 有 一 个 妇 人 来 迎 接 他 ， 是 妓 女 的 打 扮 ， 有 诡 诈 的 心 思 。 \n [kjv] And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. \n [bbe] And the woman came out to him, in the dress of a loose woman, with a designing heart; \n 7:11 [hgb] 这 妇 人 喧 嚷 不 守 约 束 ， 在 家 里 停 不 住 脚 。 \n [kjv] (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: \n [bbe] She is full of noise and uncontrolled; her feet keep not in her house. \n 7:12 [hgb] 有 时 在 街 市 上 ， 有 时 在 宽 阔 处 ， 或 在 各 巷 口 蹲 伏 。 \n [kjv] Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) \n [bbe] Now she is in the street, now in the open spaces, waiting at every turning of the road. \n 7:13 [hgb] 拉 住 那 少 年 人 ， 与 他 亲 嘴 ， 脸 无 羞 耻 对 他 说 ， \n [kjv] So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, \n [bbe] So she took him by his hand, kissing him, and without a sign of shame she said to him: \n 7:14 [hgb] 平 安 祭 在 我 这 里 。 今 日 才 还 了 我 所 许 的 愿 。 \n [kjv] I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. \n [bbe] I have a feast of peace-offerings, for today my oaths have been effected. \n 7:15 [hgb] 因 此 ， 我 出 来 迎 接 你 ， 恳 切 求 见 你 的 面 ， 恰 巧 遇 见 了 你 。 \n [kjv] Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. \n [bbe] So I came out in the hope of meeting you, looking for you with care, and now I have you. \n 7:16 [hgb] 我 已 经 用 绣 花 毯 子 ， 和 埃 及 线 织 的 花 纹 布 ， 铺 了 我 的 床 。 \n [kjv] I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. \n [bbe] My bed is covered with cushions of needlework, with coloured cloths of the cotton thread of Egypt; \n 7:17 [hgb] 我 又 用 没 药 ， 沉 香 ， 桂 皮 ， 薰 了 我 的 榻 。 \n [kjv] I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. \n [bbe] I have made my bed sweet with perfumes and spices. \n 7:18 [hgb] 你 来 ， 我 们 可 以 饱 享 爱 情 ， 直 到 早 晨 。 我 们 可 以 彼 此 亲 爱 欢 乐 。 \n [kjv] Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. \n [bbe] Come, let us take our pleasure in love till the morning, having joy in love\u0027s delights. \n 7:19 [hgb] 因 为 我 丈 夫 不 在 家 ， 出 门 行 远 路 。 \n [kjv] For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: \n [bbe] For the master of the house is away on a long journey: \n 7:20 [hgb] 他 手 拿 银 囊 。 必 到 月 望 才 回 家 。 \n [kjv] He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. \n [bbe] He has taken a bag of money with him; he is coming back at the full moon. \n 7:21 [hgb] 淫 妇 用 许 多 巧 言 诱 他 随 从 ， 用 谄 媚 的 嘴 逼 他 同 行 。 \n [kjv] With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. \n [bbe] With her fair words she overcame him, forcing him with her smooth lips. \n 7:22 [hgb] 少 年 人 立 刻 跟 随 她 ， 好 像 牛 往 宰 杀 之 地 ， 又 像 愚 昧 人 带 锁 链 ， 去 受 刑 罚 。 \n [kjv] He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; \n [bbe] The simple man goes after her, like an ox going to its death, like a roe pulled by a cord; \n 7:23 [hgb] 直 等 箭 穿 他 的 肝 ， 如 同 雀 鸟 急 入 网 罗 ， 却 不 知 是 自 丧 己 命 。 \n [kjv] Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. \n [bbe] Like a bird falling into a net; with no thought that his life is in danger, till an arrow goes into his side. \n 7:24 [hgb] 众 子 阿 ， 现 在 要 听 从 我 ， 留 心 听 我 口 中 的 话 。 \n [kjv] Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. \n [bbe] So now, my sons, give ear to me; give attention to the sayings of my mouth; \n 7:25 [hgb] 你 的 心 ， 不 可 偏 向 淫 妇 的 道 。 不 要 入 她 的 迷 途 。 \n [kjv] Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. \n [bbe] Let not your heart be turned to her ways, do not go wandering in her footsteps. \n 7:26 [hgb] 因 为 被 她 伤 害 仆 倒 的 不 少 。 被 她 杀 戮 的 而 且 甚 多 。 \n [kjv] For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her. \n [bbe] For those wounded and made low by her are great in number; and all those who have come to their death through her are a great army. \n 7:27 [hgb] 她 的 家 是 在 阴 间 之 路 ， 下 到 死 亡 之 宫 。 \n [kjv] Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death. \n [bbe] Her house is the way to the underworld, going down to the rooms of death. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1813.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
