{"id":5520,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"14:1 [hgb] 智 慧 妇 人 ， 建 立 家 室 。 愚 妄 妇 人 ， 亲 手 拆 毁 。 \n [kjv] Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. \n [bbe] Wisdom is building her house, but the foolish woman is pulling it down with her hands. \n 14:2 [hgb] 行 动 正 直 的 ， 敬 畏 耶 和 华 。 行 事 乖 僻 的 ， 却 藐 视 他 。 \n [kjv] He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. \n [bbe] He who goes on his way in righteousness has before him the fear of the Lord; but he whose ways are twisted gives him no honour. \n 14:3 [hgb] 愚 妄 人 口 中 骄 傲 ， 如 杖 责 打 己 身 。 智 慧 人 的 嘴 ， 必 保 守 自 己 。 \n [kjv] In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. \n [bbe] In the mouth of the foolish man is a rod for his back, but the lips of the wise will keep them safe. \n 14:4 [hgb] 家 里 无 牛 ， 槽 头 干 净 。 土 产 加 多 ， 乃 凭 牛 力 。 \n [kjv] Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox. \n [bbe] Where there are no oxen, their food-place is clean; but much increase comes through the strength of the ox. \n 14:5 [hgb] 诚 实 见 证 人 ， 不 说 谎 话 。 假 见 证 人 ， 吐 出 谎 言 。 \n [kjv] A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies. \n [bbe] A true witness does not say what is false, but a false witness is breathing out deceit. \n 14:6 [hgb] 亵 慢 人 寻 智 慧 ， 却 寻 不 着 。 聪 明 人 易 得 知 识 。 \n [kjv] A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth. \n [bbe] The hater of authority, searching for wisdom, does not get it; but knowledge comes readily to the open-minded man. \n 14:7 [hgb] 到 愚 昧 人 面 前 ， 不 见 他 嘴 中 有 知 识 。 \n [kjv] Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge. \n [bbe] Go away from the foolish man, for you will not see the lips of knowledge. \n 14:8 [hgb] 通 达 人 的 智 慧 ， 在 乎 明 白 己 道 。 愚 昧 人 的 愚 妄 ， 乃 是 诡 诈 。 （ 或 作 自 欺 ） \n [kjv] The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit. \n [bbe] The wisdom of the man of good sense makes his way clear; but the unwise behaviour of the foolish is deceit. \n 14:9 [hgb] 愚 妄 人 犯 罪 ， 以 为 戏 耍 。 （ 或 作 赎 愆 祭 愚 弄 愚 妄 人 ） 正 直 人 互 相 喜 悦 。 \n [kjv] Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour. \n [bbe] In the tents of those hating authority there is error, but in the house of the upright man there is grace. \n 14:10 [hgb] 心 中 的 苦 楚 ， 自 己 知 道 。 心 里 的 喜 乐 ， 外 人 无 干 。 \n [kjv] The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. \n [bbe] No one has knowledge of a man\u0027s grief but himself; and a strange person has no part in his joy. \n 14:11 [hgb] 奸 恶 人 的 房 屋 必 倾 倒 。 正 直 人 的 帐 棚 必 兴 盛 。 \n [kjv] The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish. \n [bbe] The house of the sinner will be overturned, but the tent of the upright man will do well. \n 14:12 [hgb] 有 一 条 路 人 以 为 正 。 至 终 成 为 死 亡 之 路 。 \n [kjv] There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. \n [bbe] There is a way which seems straight before a man, but its end is the ways of death. \n 14:13 [hgb] 人 在 喜 笑 中 ， 心 也 忧 愁 。 快 乐 至 极 ， 就 生 愁 苦 。 \n [kjv] Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness. \n [bbe] Even while laughing the heart may be sad; and after joy comes sorrow. \n 14:14 [hgb] 心 中 背 道 的 ， 必 满 得 自 己 的 结 果 。 善 人 必 从 自 己 的 行 为 ， 得 以 知 足 。 \n [kjv] The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself. \n [bbe] He whose heart is turned away will have the reward of his ways in full measure; but a good man will have the reward of his doings. \n 14:15 [hgb] 愚 蒙 人 是 话 都 信 。 通 达 人 步 步 谨 慎 。 \n [kjv] The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going. \n [bbe] The simple man has faith in every word, but the man of good sense gives thought to his footsteps. \n 14:16 [hgb] 智 慧 人 惧 怕 ， 就 远 离 恶 事 。 愚 妄 人 却 狂 傲 自 恃 。 \n [kjv] A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident. \n [bbe] The wise man, fearing, keeps himself from evil; but the foolish man goes on in his pride, with no thought of danger. \n 14:17 [hgb] 轻 易 发 怒 的 ， 行 事 愚 妄 。 设 立 诡 计 的 ， 被 人 恨 恶 。 \n [kjv] He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. \n [bbe] He who is quickly angry will do what is foolish, but the man of good sense will have quiet. \n 14:18 [hgb] 愚 蒙 人 得 愚 昧 为 产 业 。 通 达 人 得 知 识 为 冠 冕 。 \n [kjv] The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. \n [bbe] Foolish behaviour is the heritage of the simple, but men of good sense are crowned with knowledge. \n 14:19 [hgb] 坏 人 俯 伏 在 善 人 面 前 。 恶 人 俯 伏 在 义 人 门 口 。 \n [kjv] The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. \n [bbe] The knees of the evil are bent before the good; and sinners go down in the dust at the doors of the upright. \n 14:20 [hgb] 贫 穷 人 连 邻 舍 也 恨 他 。 富 足 人 朋 友 最 多 。 \n [kjv] The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends. \n [bbe] The poor man is hated even by his neighbour, but the man of wealth has numbers of friends. \n 14:21 [hgb] 藐 视 邻 舍 的 ， 这 人 有 罪 。 怜 悯 贫 穷 的 ， 这 人 有 福 。 \n [kjv] He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he. \n [bbe] He who has no respect for his neighbour is a sinner, but he who has pity for the poor is happy. \n 14:22 [hgb] 谋 恶 的 岂 非 走 入 迷 途 吗 ？ 谋 善 的 必 得 慈 爱 和 诚 实 。 \n [kjv] Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. \n [bbe] Will not the designers of evil come into error? But mercy and good faith are for the designers of good. \n 14:23 [hgb] 诸 般 勤 劳 ， 都 有 益 处 。 嘴 上 多 言 ， 乃 致 穷 乏 。 \n [kjv] In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury. \n [bbe] In all hard work there is profit, but talk only makes a man poor. \n 14:24 [hgb] 智 慧 人 的 财 ， 为 自 己 的 冠 冕 。 愚 妄 人 的 愚 昧 ， 终 是 愚 昧 。 \n [kjv] The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly. \n [bbe] Their wisdom is a crown to the wise, but their foolish behaviour is round the head of the unwise. \n 14:25 [hgb] 作 真 见 证 的 ， 救 人 性 命 。 吐 出 谎 言 的 ， 施 行 诡 诈 。 \n [kjv] A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies. \n [bbe] A true witness is the saviour of lives; but he who says false things is a cause of deceit. \n 14:26 [hgb] 敬 畏 耶 和 华 的 ， 大 有 倚 靠 。 他 的 儿 女 ， 也 有 避 难 所 。 \n [kjv] In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. \n [bbe] For him in whose heart is the fear of the Lord there is strong hope: and his children will have a safe place. \n 14:27 [hgb] 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 就 是 生 命 的 泉 源 ， 可 以 使 人 离 开 死 亡 的 网 罗 。 \n [kjv] The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. \n [bbe] The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, by which one may be turned from the nets of death. \n 14:28 [hgb] 帝 王 荣 耀 在 乎 民 多 。 君 王 衰 败 在 乎 民 少 。 \n [kjv] In the multitude of people is the king\u0027s honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. \n [bbe] A king\u0027s glory is in the number of his people: and for need of people a ruler may come to destruction. \n 14:29 [hgb] 不 轻 易 发 怒 的 ， 大 有 聪 明 。 性 情 暴 躁 的 ， 大 显 愚 妄 。 \n [kjv] He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. \n [bbe] He who is slow to be angry has great good sense; but he whose spirit is over-quick gives support to what is foolish. \n 14:30 [hgb] 心 中 安 静 ， 是 肉 体 的 生 命 。 嫉 妒 是 骨 中 的 朽 烂 。 \n [kjv] A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones. \n [bbe] A quiet mind is the life of the body, but envy is a disease in the bones. \n 14:31 [hgb] 欺 压 贫 寒 的 ， 是 辱 没 造 他 的 主 。 怜 悯 穷 乏 的 ， 乃 是 尊 敬 主 \n [kjv] He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor. \n [bbe] He who is hard on the poor puts shame on his Maker; but he who has mercy on those who are in need gives him honour. \n 14:32 [hgb] 恶 人 在 所 行 的 恶 上 ， 必 被 推 倒 。 义 人 临 死 ， 有 所 投 靠 。 \n [kjv] The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death. \n [bbe] The sinner is overturned in his evil-doing, but the upright man has hope in his righteousness. \n 14:33 [hgb] 智 慧 存 在 聪 明 人 心 中 。 愚 昧 人 心 里 所 存 的 ， 显 而 易 见 。 \n [kjv] Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known. \n [bbe] Wisdom has her resting-place in the mind of the wise, but she is not seen among the foolish. \n 14:34 [hgb] 公 义 使 邦 国 高 举 。 罪 恶 是 人 民 的 羞 辱 。 \n [kjv] Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people. \n [bbe] By righteousness a nation is lifted up, but sin is a cause of shame to the peoples. \n 14:35 [hgb] 智 慧 的 臣 子 ， 蒙 王 恩 惠 。 贻 羞 的 仆 人 ， 遭 其 震 怒 。 \n [kjv] The king\u0027s favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame. \n [bbe] The king has pleasure in a servant who does wisely, but his wrath is against him who is a cause of shame. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123/1820.html","bookId":180,"book":{"id":180,"title":"箴言 Proverbs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 箴 言 。 [kjv] The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; [bbe] The wise sayings of Sol...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
