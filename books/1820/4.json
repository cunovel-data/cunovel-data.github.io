I wasn’t about to let her leave.\n “Then at least have a cup of coffee before you go,” I said.\n I was relieved when she agreed and sat down at the island. I poured her a cup of coffee and placed it in front of her. I picked up the glass of what she called ‘a hangover cocktail’ and forced it down. It was disgusting, and I could tell she was trying not to laugh at me as I was drinking it. I leaned over the counter and looked at this beautiful woman sitting across from me.\n “Why on earth would you help me like that? What if I was a r**ist or murderer?” I seriously asked.\n She threw her head back and laughed. “You couldn’t rape or murder me even if you wanted to. You were so far gone last night; I could barely get you home.”\n I ran my hand through my hair because she wasn’t taking what I was saying seriously, and she could have been in danger if it was anyone else besides me.\n “You shouldn’t be doing those kinds of things; it’s not safe in this city for a girl to be doing shit like that,” I said with agitation.\n She put her elbow up on the counter and leaned her head on her hand as she stared intently at me with a smirk on her face. I got the impression she thought I was joking, so I narrowed my eyes at her.\n “Are you even listening to me?” I asked.\n Instead of answering my question, she lightly laughed and got up from the stool.\n “Thanks for the coffee, but I need to get home. Have a lovely day, Mr. Black, and next time, don’t drink so much,” she said with a smile.\n Damn that smile. I followed her to the elevator and asked her if she had a name.\n “It’s Ellery Lane!” she yelled.\n I stood there and watched the elevator doors shut as the beautiful woman known as Ellery Lane disappeared from my sight. I swallowed hard as I ran my hands through my hair. I raced up the steps to my bedroom. I threw on a pair of jeans and took out a shirt from the drawer. I grabbed my shoes and raced down to where my Range Rover was parked. I climbed inside, put on my shoes, and pulled out of the garage. That’s when I saw her get into a cab around the corner. I discreetly followed the cab to her apartment. I parked the Range Rover across the street and watched her as she got out and waved bye to the driver. I quickly typed her address into my phone. I sat there and watched as she walked into her apartment and shut the door. I felt like a stalker. What the hell was I doing? I asked myself as I pulled away from the curb.\n I didn’t want to think about Ellery Lane anymore. She was a nice girl who made sure I got home safe. I’m still baffled as to why she thought it was a good idea to help a total stranger like that. Is she oblivious to the dangers in the world?\n I had some paperwork to catch up on at the office, so I headed there instead of going back to the penthouse. Being Saturday, the building will be quiet, and I’ll be able to work without any distractions. I entered Black Enterprises and pushed the button for the elevator. I heard my phone go off, and as I pulled it from my pocket, I saw a text message from Ashlyn.\n “Connor, I’m sorry about last night, and I think it’s important we talk.”\n I sighed as I put my phone back in my pocket and took the elevator up to my office. I couldn’t think about Ashlyn right now. I didn’t want to deal with her, but I knew at some point it was going to happen. I walked to my desk and turned the computer on. I put my hands in my pocket, turned around, and stared at New York City from my large office window. My mind was racing. I have a lot of paperwork to do and phone calls to make regarding the sale of a company that I’m interested in buying; however, that’s not what my mind was racing about. The thoughts running through my head are of Ellery Lane, her beautiful eyes, and her sinfully sexy smile.\n I sat down at my desk and started going through some paperwork. My phone went off again with another text message from Ashlyn.\n “Don’t you dare ignore me, Connor. I want to apologize, and maybe we can settle this disagreement another way.”\n If I didn’t answer her back, she’d be messaging me all day. I sighed as I dialed her number.\n “Hello, Connor. Thank you for calling.”\n “Ashlyn, I’m very busy, and I really don’t have the time to talk or text you. Say what you have to say, so we can move on.”\n “I wanted to apologize for last night, and I understand that you’re not ready to commit to one woman yet. I have made peace with our little arrangement for now, but I do have one stipulation.”\n I sighed and leaned back in the chair. “What’s your stipulation, Ashlyn?”\n “I want you to double what you send me monthly, and I’ll forget about our little conversation last night.”\n “There’s no way I’m doubling what I pay you. If it wasn’t for me, you’d still be on the streets.\n Keep in mind, I’m only helping you because of Amanda.” I heard her take in a deep breath as she spoke into the phone.\n “I’m sorry, Connor, but I’m not happy, and I’ve been feeling really depressed. My self-esteem is at its lowest right now, and you made it worse last night with the cruel things you said. I don’t know if there’s any reason for me to go on anymore. What’s left here for me, Connor?”\n I got up from my chair and paced around the office. “Ashlyn, don’t speak like that. You have a lot going for you. I gave you a job at my company. I pay you a monthly salary in addition to what Black Enterprises pays you, and you get to see me three times a week. You know how I am, Ashlyn, and you know my rules.”\n “I know, Connor, but I just feel like I don’t belong in this world anymore.”\n I couldn’t believe she was saying this. She was reminding me of Amanda, and I couldn’t be sure that she wouldn’t do the same thing. So, I hesitantly agreed to her demands.\n “Fine, Ashlyn, I’ll double your monthly salary, but I want you to promise me you’re going to do something with your life with that money. Take some classes or something.”\n “I knew you’d understand, Connor. Thank you for everything, and I’ll consider what you said.”\n “I have to go, Ashlyn; I’m busy, and I have a lot to do.”\n I hung up the phone and rubbed my face. What the hell did I get myself into? I asked myself as I sat there and stared blankly across the room. I picked up the paperwork in front of me and began looking through it. It wasn’t too long before I threw my pen across my desk and leaned back in my chair, thinking about Ellery. I couldn’t get that woman out of my head, and it’s driving me crazy. I felt the need to really thank her for helping me last night. She wouldn’t take my money, which is odd because all women do. She didn’t seem to want to stay with me any longer than necessary, and she had an attitude problem. Then it hit me, I’ll treat her to a nice dinner. Every woman likes to go to a fancy restaurant and have a nice meal. Carson Williams is a friend of mine and the owner of Le Sur. I called him and had him make a reservation for two for 7:30 pm that evening. I didn’t want to give her the option of turning me down if I called her on the phone and asked her, so I decided to send the invitation via messenger. I quickly typed a note on my computer.\n “Miss Lane, I’m going to properly thank you for your services last night. I will be waiting for you at Le Sur Restaurant. My driver will pick you up promptly at 7:00 pm ~ Connor Black”\n I took the paper off the printer, neatly folded it, and placed it in an envelope. I wrote her name on the outside and headed out of the building. I called Justin and asked him to meet me at Starbucks.\n Justin’s an intern at my company, and I occasionally have him run some personal errands for me when my secretary isn’t available.\n “Good afternoon, Mr. Black,” he said as he sat at the table.\n “Hello, Justin, I need you to do a favor for me,” I said as I sat down across from him.\n I slid the envelope across the table to him. “I want you to deliver this letter to Miss Ellery Lane. I have her address right here.”\n Justin took the envelope and smiled. “Of course, Mr. Black, I’ll do it right away.”\n I took out my wallet and handed him a $50 bill. “Thank you, Justin, this is very important.”\n He smiled as he got up from the table. “Thank you, Mr. Black, I’ll deliver it now.”\n I sat there, wondering if this was such a good idea. What if she doesn’t show up? I sighed as I headed back to the penthouse.\n Chapter 4\n I arrived at the penthouse and walked into the kitchen for a bottle of water. Denny followed behind me.\n “You wanted to see me, Connor?”\n “Denny, I need you to pick up Miss Ellery Lane at this address promptly at 7:00 pm,” I said as I handed him the paper with her address on it.\n Denny looked at me as the corners of his mouth turned up. “Miss Lane, huh?”\n “Don’t get any ideas, Denny. She helped me home last night from the club, and I’m just thanking her by taking her to dinner, that’s all.”\n “What happened to Miss Ashlyn driving you home?” he asked.\n “Let’s just say we didn’t agree on something and then she left. Miss Lane was kind enough to get my drunken ass home safely. To be honest with you, Denny, I don’t remember a thing about last night.\n I found her in the kitchen this morning, making me some nasty hangover drink and coffee.”\n He looked at me with a strange look. “So she’s another one of your girls from the club?”\n “No, Denny, she’s not. Nothing happened between us when she brought me home.”\n He smiled and walked out of the kitchen. I opened the bottle of water and took a sip as I leaned up against the counter. I headed up the stairs, heading to the bathroom for a shower. I stood under the stream of hot water as it ran down my body. I was thinking about Ellery and how I can’t get her smile out of my mind. My heart started to beat a little faster every time I thought about her. I stepped out of the shower and got dressed. I reached in the cabinet for my cologne. Tonight, I opted to go with Armani instead of the Dolce \u0026 Gabbana that I usually wear. I looked at my watch, noticing that Denny will be picking Ellery up in 15 minutes. When I arrived at Le Sur, Allison, the red headed hostess, led me to a private table that sat in the corner of the restaurant.\n “Is there anything that I can get you or do for you, Mr. Black?” she smiled.\n “No, Allison, I’m good, but thank you,” I said as she frowned and walked away. She’s been trying to get me in bed for a couple of years. What she doesn’t understand is that she’s not my type. I pulled out my phone and sent a quick text message to Denny.\n “Is she with you?”\n “Yes, Mr. Black, she is,” he replied promptly.\n I sat at the table, sipping on water because I suddenly became very hot. I took out my phone to check the stock market, and as I looked up, I saw Allison escorting Ellery to the table. I stared at her from a distance, and my stomach tied itself in knots. I got up and walked around to her side. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-4.html","bookId":1820,"book":{"id":1820,"title":"Forever You (Forever #2)","description":"Storyline: \n New York Times bestselling novel, Forever You is the highly demanded sequel to USA Today’s Bestseller, Forever Black. \n Connor Black’s life consisted of his company and his use of multiple women.
