I knelt down beside her and lightly took her hand.\n “Stop, you’re going to cut yourself,” I whispered as I removed the pieces of glass from her hand.\n She took in a deep breath and started to say she was sorry. She didn’t need to apologize. She had every right to act the way she did. I took her face in my hands, “I know, baby, and it’s ok.”\n “No, it’s not, Connor. I know this is hard for you, and I’m so sorry.”\n She was begging for forgiveness, but she didn’t need to. I brought my lips to hers as I said, “It’s ok, baby. I didn’t mean what I said; it came out wrong.”\n “I know you didn’t, and I overreacted.”\n I kissed her again and held her tight, letting her know that she was forgiven.\n “Where did you go?” she asked.\n I got up from the floor and told her to go sit on the bed. I walked over to the dresser, grabbed the brown bag, and handed it to her. “I figured this would make you feel better,” I said with caution. She opened up the bag, and her eyes widened as she looked inside and dumped the chocolate on the bed.\n “You are amazing and absolutely perfect! I love you,” she said as she wrapped her arms around me and pulled me on top of her. “I know something else that will make me feel better,” she smiled as I hovered over her.\n “Are you sure you’re up for it?” I asked. She lifted her head and kissed me passionately. That was the only sign I needed.\n The next morning I got out of bed and made a pot of coffee. Ellery was still asleep, and I had some business I needed to take care of. I sat on the couch with my phone and opened an email from Phil, stating that there’s one more meeting scheduled to finalize the deal for the Chicago Company. He said the meeting is first thing tomorrow morning and that I really need to be there. I got to thinking that it would be great to bring Ellery back to New York, so we could spend more time together, and she’d be able to see Peyton.\n She stumbled out of the bedroom, rubbing her eyes and yawning as she headed towards the coffee pot. “Hey, babe, I hope I didn’t wake you,” I smiled. She poured some coffee and sat down next to me. I leaned over and ran my finger over her lips before kissing them good morning. I told her how I needed to fly back to New York today for the meeting tomorrow morning, and that I wanted her to come home with me. She was unsure if she could because of her treatment. I explained to her that it didn’t matter, and that we’d be back here for her second treatment next month. She threw her arms around me in excitement, especially when I told her that she would be living with me at the Penthouse. I laughed when she pouted and asked me if she had to stay in the guest room. I took the coffee cup from her hands and set it down on the table. I grabbed her and pulled her onto my lap as I lifted up her nightshirt, threw it on the floor, and made love to her.\n I was in the bathroom shaving while Ellery was still in the shower. I could smell the lilac scented body wash that she was using. It’s the same scent that I’ve smelled since I first met her. She stepped out of the shower, wrapped a towel around her wet body, and walked up behind me, wrapping her arms around my waist and laying her head on my back. I stopped shaving and looked at her through the mirror. She had a smile on her face. Damn that smile. I turned around so her head was on my chest as I wrapped my arms around her.\n “What’s wrong?” I asked.\n “Nothing’s wrong. Can’t a woman hug the man she loves without there being something wrong?”\n she asked.\n “Of course she can,” I said as I kissed the top of her head. She took her hands, placed them on my chest, and gave me a kiss. “I love you, Connor Black,” she smiled. “I love you too, Ellery Lane,” I smiled back and kissed her nose. “Now, let me get back to shaving,” I said.\n Her bathroom was small, and there was really only room at the sink for one person. Ellery decided she was going to be funny and pushed me out of the way so she could brush her teeth. She reached over to the medicine cabinet and opened it as I was in the middle of shaving. I could see the smirk on her face. She grabbed her toothbrush and toothpaste and shut the cabinet. She reached over me and ran her toothbrush under the running water. “Would you like me to move out of your way?” I asked. She looked at me as she put her toothbrush in her mouth. “No, you’re fine,” she mumbled. I took the can of shaving cream and put some on my hands. I started to bring my hands up to my face when she bumped into me so she could spit in the sink. I lightly pushed her back, and she missed the sink and spat on my leg. She looked up at me and tried to hold back the laughter that was dying to come out. I looked at her, then at my leg.\n “Oh please! We share spit all the time,” she started to laugh.\n I was going to play this one cool and get her back. “It’s ok, Ellery. It was an accident,” I said as I opened my hand with the shaving cream on it and planted it firmly on her cheek. Her jaw dropped as she looked in the mirror. She looked at me with that look she gets when she’s going to take revenge.\n She grabbed the tube of toothpaste and squirted it at my chest.\n “Here’s a little toothpaste to go with that shaving cream,” she said.\n I took my finger and tried to wipe the toothpaste off as she stood there, smiling; our eyes never leaving one another. I grabbed the can of shaving cream and squirted her legs and chest with it. She jumped back and screamed.\n “Need a shave darling?” I asked.\n “How dare you!” she exclaimed.\n I laughed as I pointed the shaving cream at her, and she ran out of the bathroom, holding her towel so it didn’t fall off. I chased after her and tackled her to the ground. I rolled her over and pinned her arms above her head. I stared at her, mesmerized by her beauty. I took my hand and gently wiped away the shaving cream from her face while my other hand had her wrists locked tight. She didn’t struggle. I could tell by the way she stared into my eyes that she didn’t want me to stop. I was hard and wanting her again.\n “I want to feel you inside me,” she whispered.\n I wanted to make sure that she was ready because I didn’t want to hurt her. I reached down with my free hand and felt how wet she was. I pushed myself into her. She titled her head back and lightly moaned as her hands were running through my hair. I moved in and out of her slowly before I began to grind my h*ps and move circles inside her. The feeling was amazing, and hearing the sounds she made from pleasuring her was heightening my arousal. I hovered over her, pushing in and out with shallow thrusts as she moaned and became breathless. She started to come, and I followed shortly after, releasing myself inside her. I looked at her as her eyes locked on mine, taking in the pleasure and the beauty of what just happened.\n “I think we need to hit the shower again,” I smiled as I was covered in shaving cream and toothpaste.\n “At this rate, we’ll never get on that plane back to New York,” she laughed.\n I got off her and helped her up. I wrapped my arms around her from behind as we walked into the bathroom and took a shower for the second time that morning.\n Chapter 21\n We finally arrived back in New York, and Denny was waiting for us at the airport. I grabbed our bags as Ellery ran to Denny and gave him a hug. It made me really happy to see the two of them get along so well. I told Ellery that I had arranged for Peyton to come over around 7:00 pm under false pretenses. I didn’t tell Peyton that Ellery was coming back with me; I wanted her to be surprised. I took our bags up to my room while Ellery went to the kitchen to grab a bottle of water. I set our bags on the floor and heard Ellery gasp as she stood in the doorway. I had forgotten that she had only been in my bedroom once, and that was when she brought my drunken ass home from the club. At first, I couldn’t figure out why she stood there with a shocked look on her face, but then I saw her look around the room and at the paintings that hung on my wall.\n “You were the one who bought my paintings?” she asked.\n “Please tell me that you aren’t mad,” I said as I held my hands up.\n “I’m not mad; I just want to know why,” she asked softly.\n “Look at them, Elle. They’re beautiful. It was my way of being close to you when you weren’t around.” I was afraid she was going to be angry with me, but she wasn’t. She walked over to me and hugged me tight, thanking me and telling me how much it meant to her.\n She walked over to my bed and slightly giggled.\n “What’s so funny?” I asked.\n “I was just remembering the night you were passed out on this bed, and I was straddled over you, taking off your clothes.”\n I smiled as I laid myself on the bed and spread out.\n “What are you doing?” she laughed.\n “I don’t remember you doing that, and I want to, so I thought you could reenact it for me.”\n Ellery bit her bottom lip as she pulled her shirt over her head and threw it on the floor.\n “Um, I don’t think you did that,” I smiled.\n “No, I didn’t, but I’m going to make it a little more interesting this time.” I watched her as she unbuttoned her pants and took them off, throwing them on top of her shirt. She straddled me and slowly started unbuttoning my shirt. This was definitely not the way she helped me that night because I would have remembered it. “Fuck it; I need you now,” I said as I rolled her off me and quickly got on top.\n Later that night, Ellery was snuggled against me with her arm around my waist. She must have had a late night with Peyton because I didn’t hear her come to bed. I reached over and lightly kissed her on the head before carefully sliding out of bed. I had an early meeting to attend in order to finalize the acquisition of the Chicago building. After I showered and got dressed, I emerged from the bathroom and saw Ellery laying there, staring at me. I smiled as I walked over to her.\n “You need to go back to sleep, my love. It’s way too early for you to be up,” I said as I stroked her hair.\n “I rolled over, and your side of the bed was empty; I didn’t like it,” she pouted.\n “I’m sorry, baby, but I have a meeting first thing this morning.”\n “I know, and I’ll miss you while you’re gone. I hate being apart from you.”\n “Let’s meet for lunch and do some shopping. I’ll have Denny pick you up around noon,” I said as I brushed my lips against hers.\n “That sounds good; I can’t wait,” she said as a smile spread across her face.\n I couldn’t resist her smile, and I hated leaving her. I looked at the clock, and I had 15 minutes before I had to leave. I unbuttoned my pants and took them off.\n “What are you doing?” Ellery smiled.\n “Getting ready to have sex with you, but I only have about 15 minutes, so we have to be quick,” I said as I took off my shirt.\n “Hurry up and get that fine ass of yours in here,” she said as she patted my side of the bed.\n Needless to say, I was late for my meeting. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-29.html","bookId":1820,"book":{"id":1820,"title":"Forever You (Forever #2)","description":"Storyline: \n New York Times bestselling novel, Forever You is the highly demanded sequel to USA Today’s Bestseller, Forever Black. \n Connor Black’s life consisted of his company and his use of multiple women.
