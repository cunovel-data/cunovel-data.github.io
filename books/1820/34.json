I walked over to her, and she grabbed it out of my hands. “Let me help you,” I calmly said. “I don’t need your help; I can do it myself!” she yelled and undressed as I watched her. She climbed into bed and pointed at the door for me to leave her room. I rolled my eyes and sighed as I grabbed a pillow and laid myself on the couch. I turned on the TV, but it was playing a DVD. The woman on the screen looked just like Ellery. I restarted it from the beginning and watched as Ellery’s mother spoke to her. No wonder she went to the club and drank like that. Between watching this video and me, the girl was a wreck. I felt horrible, and I should’ve been here for her while she watched it. I wanted nothing more than to climb into bed next to her and hold her tight. I wanted to tell her how much I love her and that I’m here for her, but it’s the last thing she wanted, so I respected her wishes and slept on the couch. I woke up early the next morning and put on a pot of strong coffee. Ellery was going to need it because she was going to have one hell of a hangover. I leaned up against the counter, waiting for the coffee to brew as she emerged from the bedroom. “Good morning; you look like shit,” I smiled, trying to be funny and lighten the moment. “Yeah, well, we all can’t look as perfect as you,” she frowned. I smiled as I handed her a cup of coffee. “Do I get a hug?” I asked as I held my arms out. “Sluts don’t give hugs,” she snarled as she grabbed her cup and walked away. Obviously she’s still pissed about the ‘slut’ remark. I was hoping she wouldn’t remember that. I took my coffee, sat at the table, and waited for her to get ready. After 20 minutes, she was finally ready and she went to the cabinet to grab a bottle of Motrin. She was having trouble opening the bottle, so I walked over to her and tried to take it from her hands to help her. She wouldn’t let go and told me to go away. We arrived at the hospital in silence. She walked a few feet ahead of me through the parking lot. I tried to hold her hand, but she just jerked it away. “I don’t understand why you’re so mad,” I finally said. “You called me a slut, Connor.” “I said you looked like a slut, Elle.” She shook her head, “Same thing, you idiot.” When we reached the office, the nurse took us promptly to the room. Ellery changed into the thin gown and sat on the bed, waiting for Dr. Murphy. She wouldn’t even look at me. “Are you even going to look at me?” I asked. “I’m so mad at you, Connor Black, I could scream.” I walked over to her and tried to take her hand, but she pulled away. “If you think I’m going to apologize, then you’re in for a surprise because I’m not. What you did last night was unacceptable and immature,” I said. “At least I didn’t take the guy home and f**k him like you did with random strangers!” she spat while staring me straight in the eyes. “Why did I even bother coming here?” I asked. “I don’t know, Connor; why the hell did you?” Dr. Murphy walked in and looked at us. She could feel the tension in the room. “Hello, Ellery, Mr. Black,” she smiled. Ellery laid herself down on her side, and I sat on the edge of the bed, facing her. She looked at me and pointed to the chair. “You; go sit over there,” she growled. I sighed and shook my head as I got up and sat across the room. She wouldn’t even look at me when the first injection went in. She whimpered like before until the second injection pierced her skin, and Ellery let out a scream. She held out her hand to me, and I was by her side in a second. She clutched my shirt in her fists as I wrapped my arms around her and kissed her on the head. “You are the most stubborn person that I’ve ever met,” I whispered. She cried as Dr. Murphy gave her the last injection. I climbed on the bed while still holding her and laid myself next to her. It felt so good to have her in my arms again. I kept kissing the top of her head as she tried to sleep for the next couple of hours. When Ellery woke up and we got the ok from Dr. Murphy, I took her home, and she laid herself on the couch. “Are you going to be comfortable there?” I asked her, but she ignored me. I knelt down in front of her; my eyes staring into hers. “Would it be ok if I gave you a kiss? I’ve really missed those lips.” I laughed as she clamped her mouth shut. I ran my finger softly over her mouth and up her cheek. I leaned into her and softly brushed my lips against hers. It didn’t take long before she gave in, and her lips joined mine. She parted her lips so my tongue had access to her whole mouth. The kiss was light and soft. I broke our kiss and looked at her. I didn’t say anything at first. I just stared at her, taking in her beauty and thinking about how much I love her. “I’ve never loved anyone like I love you, Ellery, and no matter what we’ve been through, or are going to go through, nothing will ever change the way I feel,” I said. Tears began to swell in her eyes as she cupped my face in her hands. “I love you too, and I’m sorry, again,” she started to cry. “I think we’re going to spend our whole lives apologizing to each other,” I lightly laughed. She sat up so I could sit next to her. I pulled her onto me so her head was resting in my lap. I started to gently stroke her hair as she fell asleep. I pulled my phone out and sent a text message to Denny. “I need you to be in California the day after tomorrow. That’s when I’m proposing to Ellery. Make the arrangements for the rental of the beach, the dinner, and tent. It has to be perfect.” “Don’t worry, Connor; I have Valerie and Claire helping. Everything will be perfect. I’ll see you in a couple of days. Now, calm down.” I carefully lifted Ellery’s head and scooted off the couch. I covered her with a blanket and went into the bedroom to call Phil. He told me that the cops were holding someone in custody that fit the description of someone lurking around the building the night of the fire. He told me not to worry and that he’ll take care of things while I’m gone. Just as I hung up, Ellery came walking into the bedroom. “I hope I didn’t wake you,” I said as she wrapped her arms around me. “No, I woke up on my own,” she smiled. “Who were you talking to?” “I was talking to Phil about something that happened before I came out here.” “What happened?” she asked with concern. I pushed her hair away from her face. “It’s nothing for you to worry about. It’s just business,” I said as I kissed her lips. Her hands traveled down my back as she firmly grabbed my ass. I broke our kiss and smiled at her. “What do you think you’re doing?” I asked. “Just feeling that tight ass of yours, Mr. Black,” she smiled. Ellery moved her hands around to the front and felt my hard c*ck through my jeans. “Well, we sure can’t let that hard on go to waste,” she said as she unbuttoned my pants and slowly pulled them down. I looked at her with a smile as she caught me off guard and went down on me. Her mouth was amazing. I closed my eyes and threw my head back as she licked every inch of my erection with her soft warm tongue. She rolled her tongue around the tip like she was eating an ice cream cone before gently wrapping her mouth around me and sliding the head against the roof of her mouth. I was already on the verge of exploding. After she had taken me in her mouth, she began slow even bobs. I started to thrust my h*ps back and forth and fist her hair as her sucking increased. She took her hand and gently stroked my balls. I groaned as my breathing became rapid, and I was ready to come. “Ellery, I’m going to come,” I warned her in case she didn’t want me to explode in her mouth. She didn’t stop, and I yelled her name as I released myself. That was the best I’ve ever had because it came from the woman I love. Once I was done, she released her mouth and looked up at me. I knelt down and cupped her face as I kissed her passionately. We spent the rest of the night in bed hav**g s*x, discussing plans for Christmas, and drinking wine. Everything was perfect and just as it should be. Chapter 25 I opened my eyes and noticed Ellery wasn’t in bed. I thought that was odd because I’m always the first one up. Today’s the day I am proposing to her, and I couldn’t be more nervous. Denny had sent me a text last night and assured me everything was set and in place. I pulled the white box with the pink satin bow from under the bed and hid it behind my back as I walked towards Ellery to where she was standing in the kitchen. She looked at me and smiled. “What are you hiding, Mr. Black?” I smiled back and kissed her on the lips. “A present for you,” I said as I handed her the box. She opened it and pulled out the white, spaghetti strap sundress that I’d picked out for her back in New York. “I’m taking you to dinner tonight, and I want you to wear it.” “I love it,” she smiled as she kissed me. “But what’s so special about dinner tonight?” “It’s our last night in California until next month, and I want it to be special, especially since tomorrow is Christmas Eve.” “You’re so sweet,” she said as she hugged me. I picked her up and swung her around. “I know something else I can give you that’s sweet,” I smiled as I carried her to the bedroom and made love to her. I sent a text to Denny to make sure he was outside, waiting with the limo. I made sure I had everything, including the ring. “Come on, babe; we’re going to be late for our reservation!” I shouted across the apartment. “Excuse me, but if you recall, I was just getting out of the shower when you decided to push me back in,” she smiled as she emerged from the bedroom. I gasped when I saw her in the white sundress. She looked as beautiful as an angel that fell from the sky. “You look absolutely beautiful, baby,” I said as I held out my arm to her. “Thank you, my love,” she smiled. Damn that smile. We walked outside, and she was surprised to see a limo parked at the curb. I opened the door for her, and I heard her gasp as she slid in the back seat. “Denny, what are you doing here?” He turned and looked at her with a smile. “It’s good to see you, Ellery.” “Why is Denny driving us in California?” she asked as I sat next to her. “I need to blindfold you,” I smiled. “Don’t you think that’s a little too kinky with Denny here?” she said. “Trust me; we’ll be using this in the bedroom, but for now, where I’m taking you is a surprise, and I don’t want you to know until we get there,” I said as I took out a black cloth and covered her eyes. “Are you ok?” I asked. “Except for being incredibly turned on, yes,” she smiled. We arrived at the beach, and I helped Ellery out of the limo. We walked a few feet and then I stopped, bent down, and removed her shoes from her feet.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-34.html","bookId":1820,"book":{"id":1820,"title":"Forever You (Forever #2)","description":"Storyline: New York Times bestselling novel, Forever You is the highly demanded sequel to USA Today’s Bestseller, Forever Black.
