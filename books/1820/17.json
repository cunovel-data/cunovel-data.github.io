{"id":86143,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"I continued to look down, still pinning her body against the door. It was my fault that we were in this position, and it’s time that she knows the truth. If she wants to leave after I tell her, then I’ll let her go, and I’ll never see her again. Dr. Peters is right; there can no longer be any secrets between Ellery and me. Our friendship has come too far.\\n\\n “I had a girlfriend when I was 18. She started to become obsessive and wanted to spend every waking minute with me. It became too much to try to keep her happy and, it led me to feel like I was suffocating, so I broke up with her.” I paused and looked up at her as my eyes began to fill with tears.\\n\\n “She committed suicide two days later. She left a note, explaining that if she couldn’t have me, then she didn’t want to live and told everyone to blame me for her suicide.” I let go of her arms, taking her wrists, and turning them over.\\n\\n “You see, this is why I feel sad when I see these on you. It’s a reminder of what I did, and how I killed her.” She gasped at my words as she broke my grip and cupped my face in her hands.\\n\\n “You did nothing wrong, Connor. It wasn’t your fault that she killed herself. It was her weakness and inability to cope; you cannot blame yourself.”\\n\\n “I swore then I would never fall in love or get emotionally involved with another woman, but with you, it’s too late. I’m already emotionally attached, and I’m doing everything I can to stop myself, but I can’t.” I turned away from her; my breathing was rapid. This was her opportunity to leave, and I was willing to let her go so she can be happy, but she didn’t leave.\\n\\n Ellery walked up behind me and wrapped her arms around my waist. “I’m emotionally attached, and everything inside me said to stay away, but I see a side of you that I don’t think you let other people see; a sweet, tender, and caring man who would give his world for someone that he cares about.”\\n\\n I let out a breath. She wasn’t leaving; she was staying. She understood and didn’t care because she just wanted to be with me, and I wanted to be with her. My secret was out, and she didn’t run. I turned around and looked at her. I saw the sadness in her eyes, and I wanted to take it away. She shouldn’t be sad; she should be happy.\\n\\n I pressed my lips against hers and kissed her passionately. Our tongues danced together as I picked her up and carried her to the bedroom. My heart was racing, and my body ached for her, to touch her, and be inside her. I sat her gently on the bed as I lifted up her shirt and took it off. I took off my shirt and unbuttoned my pants, never taking my eyes off her. I never wanted to take my eyes off her again.\\n\\n She stood up, took off her jeans, and threw them on the floor. She laid down on the bed in just her black lace bra and matching thong. I stood there in awe of this amazing woman as I looked over her every curve. I never wanted anyone or anything so bad in my entire life.\\n\\n “You are so f**king beautiful,” I whispered as I ran my hand up and down her perfectly sculpted stomach. I climbed on top of her as she wrapped her arms around my neck. My lips met hers for a brief second until my tongue began to explore her neck. She moaned and tilted her head back to give me full access. She arched her back as I took down her bra straps and exposed her br**sts. A groan escaped me as I lightly sucked each hardened nipple and ran my tongue in circles down her perfect body. She pressed her h*ps against me, letting me know she wanted more. I wanted to devour her. I felt like I was going to lose my mind because I wanted her and needed her so badly.\\n\\n As I was licking and stroking every inch of her perfect body, she took her hand and pushed it down the front of my pants. I moaned out of excitement. Her hand was soft as she wrapped her long fingers around my c*ck and stroked it up and down. I lightly traced the edge of her panties as my fingers made their way to her swollen and aching clit. Her breathing was rapid as she softly moaned and said my name. I circled my fingers around her tender spot before gently inserting them inside. “You’re so wet, Ellery; god, I want you,” I moaned as our lips joined together. She continuously moaned as I moved my fingers inside her in a delicate in and out motion. She was ready to come, and I could feel her wanting to explode. She started to scream my name as I softly circled her cl*t with my thumb, releasing all of her sweet passion to me. I’ve never been more turned on in my life, and I needed to be inside her.\\n\\n I tore off my jeans and underwear and threw them across the room. “I promise I’ll be gentle with you. If I get too rough, please promise me that you’ll stop me,” I told her. I was scared that I was going to lose all control with her and hurt her. She nodded her head as I climbed on top and gently inserted myself inside her.\\n\\n I stared into her eyes with each slow and steady thrust. “What are you doing to me, Ellery?” The corners of her mouth curved up as she pulled me down to her, and we kissed passionately. Once I was fully inside her, my movements became faster. She panted with each thrust. Her hands traveled down my backside as she dug her nails into my back, exciting me more than I already was. I wanted this moment to last forever. I wanted to stay like this for eternity and never pull out of her. She felt so warm and so good. This moment was right for both of us. She needed me just as bad as I needed her. I brought my mouth to her br**sts; sucking and lightly biting each nipple. I could feel her swell and preparing for her next orgasm, making my moans become louder and my thrusts more forceful. I took her leg and brought it up to my waist, making penetration more deep and intense. “Come for me, Ellery; come, baby,” I whispered in her ear. Her breathing became fierce as she screamed my name, and her body shook in ecstasy.\\n\\n “Christ, Ellery, you feel so good.” I moaned as I yelled her name while filling her insides with my come. It was the most incredible and pleasurable feeling, and even though I’ve had sex a million times, this was different; this was new.\\n\\n I looked at her, panting and out of breath as she stroked my face with her hand and pulled me down onto her. I wrapped my hands around her head and buried myself in her neck. Our rapid heartbeats began to slow down, as did our breathing. I gently pulled out of her and fell to my side. I took my hand and softly pushed her hair away from her face so I could see all of her beauty.\\n\\n “You’re amazing,” I smiled.\\n\\n “You’re amazing,” she responded.\\n\\n We laid there and talked about how beautiful our love making was and how I felt different. Ellery explained to me that it was because I made love to her with passion and emotion. She was right; I poured every emotion I had into her. I fell for Ellery Lane the moment I saw her standing in my kitchen, and now I fell in love with her. For the first time in my life, I fell in love with someone, and it scared me. I pulled her closer and held her tight until we started round two.\\n\\n Chapter 12\\n\\n I wrapped my arms around her as she slept. I held tight because I never wanted to let her go. I lay and stare at her as she sleeps; her perfect mouth slightly open as she takes in tiny breaths. She’s peaceful now, and I need to make sure that she stays that way. I couldn’t help but softly run my finger along her jaw line. I made my way to her mouth and gently traced the outline of her perfectly shaped lips; lips that were so soft, alluring, and begging to be kissed. I couldn’t stop staring at the woman to whom I’ve given my whole heart. She stirred among the sheets and opened her eyes. I smiled as they looked up at me innocently.\\n\\n “Good morning,” she smiled.\\n\\n “Good morning, baby,” I grinned as I lightly kissed her forehead. “I hope I didn’t wake you.”\\n\\n “No, you didn’t wake me, but may I ask why you’re staring at me?” She asked with such innocence.\\n\\n “I’m staring because I never want to take my eyes off you. You’re someone who deserves my full attention at all times,” I replied as I softly ran my hand down her cheek.\\n\\n She tightened her grip around my waist as she laid her head on my chest.\\n\\n “I feel safe when I’m with you, Connor. I’ve never felt safer in my whole life,” she whispered as she kissed my skin lightly.\\n\\n I closed my eyes for a moment because she took my breath away. I’ve never felt so needed, and no one has ever needed me the way Ellery does. I need her like I need air to breathe. I need her like I need a heartbeat to keep me alive.\\n\\n She moved up closer to me, and then covered her mouth with her hand. She was embarrassed about morning breath, but I didn’t care. I rolled her over on her back and started kissing her. She stopped me and looked at the clock, saying that if we didn’t get out of bed, we were going to be late. So, I had a better idea. I slid out of bed, and she bit down on her bottom lip as she stared at me, fully nak*d and standing in front of her. I smiled as I held out my hand to her.\\n\\n “It looks like we’ll have to shower together to save time,” I said.\\n\\n She quickly took my hand, and I led her to the bathroom. I turned on the water and kept it between hot and warm, but not too hot because I didn’t want Ellery passing out again. I was going to make sure that never happened again. She stepped in first, and I followed. We stood there as the water ran down our bodies, wetting our skin. I took the soft sponge and the bottle of shower gel that was compliments of the hotel and opened it. I took in the vanilla scent and held it up to Ellery so she could smell it. She smiled as she took the shower gel from my hand and poured it on the sponge I was holding. I started to wash her slowly, starting with her br**sts as I moved the sponge in soft circles around her n**ples.\\n\\n She moaned as she took my c*ck and stroked it up and down, moving her hands in a steady motion. A groan came from the back of my throat as I continued washing every inch of her torso. She had me so excited and hard that I needed her right then and there.\\n\\n “Connor, I need you now, please,” she begged me.\\n\\n I turned her around, and pinned her arms against the shower wall, and took her slowly from behind, kissing her neck as I moved in and out of her. I let go of her arms and cupped each breast in my hands, rubbing and feeling them as she sexily moaned. Nothing was sexier than seeing her against the shower wall. I could barely control myself.\\n\\n “Are you ready, Elle?” I whispered as I wrapped my arms around her waist.\\n\\n She moaned with each deep thrust. “Yes, come with me, Connor,” she begged. Hearing her say those words were all I needed to hear. I pushed myself harder into her as I filled her up with my warmth. Her body shook as I held her tight, and we both sank to the shower floor, holding each other in pure bliss.\\n\\n Once we were able to get ourselves out of the shower, I stayed in the bathroom to shave, and Ellery went into the bedroom to get dressed. I walked into the room and found Ellery sitting on the edge of the bed. It looked like something was bothering her. I stood over her and ran my hand through her wet hair.\\n\\n “What’s wrong, baby?” I asked her.\\n\\n She looked up and smiled at me. “Nothing’s wrong; I’m just sitting here, wishing that we could stay another night in this beautiful hotel room.”\\n\\n I smiled and held my hand out to help her from the bed. “Don’t you worry; there will be plenty of beautiful hotel rooms in our future.” I meant every word I said to her. I envision a future with Ellery. I never thought it would be possible to love someone so much. I’ve kept my heart closed off for so many years, but now I know it was because she was the one who was meant to open it. She looked at me and tears began to fill her eyes. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-17.html","bookId":1820,"book":{"id":1820,"title":"Forever You (Forever #2)","description":"Storyline: New York Times bestselling novel, Forever You is the highly demanded sequel to USA Today’s Bestseller, Forever Black. \\n Connor Black’s life consisted of his company and his use of multiple women.
