What happened?” I asked.\\n\\n “Nothing to worry about darling; we’re all sick with the flu.”\\n\\n “I’m sorry, mom, is there anything you need?”\\n\\n “No, Connor, just give our apologies and have a nice time.”\\n\\n “Call me if you need me or anything,” I made her promise.\\n\\n I made my way to the garage where Denny was waiting for me. I slid into the back of the limo and took in a deep breath. Denny looked at me through the rearview mirror.\\n\\n “Are you ok, Connor?” he asked.\\n\\n “I’m fine, Denny. Let’s go pick up Miss Lane.”\\n\\n We pulled up to the curb of her apartment building. I got out and walked up to the door, then knocked and waited for her to answer. The moment the door opened, I took in a sharp breath at the sight of Ellery standing there in my favorite dress. An intoxicated feeling came over me as she smiled.\\n\\n Damn that smile.\\n\\n “Were you afraid that I’d get mugged between my door and your car?” she smirked.\\n\\n “Very funny, Ellery,” I smiled at her.\\n\\n She nudged my shoulder playfully, and I nudged her back. I opened the door for her, and she gracefully slid into the seat. I climbed in and sat beside her. I grabbed a glass and handed it to her as I poured champagne into it. Once again, my heart began beating faster than normal, and my palms were sweaty. I held my glass up to her.\\n\\n “You look beautiful, Ellery. What a lovely dress,” I said.\\n\\n “Thank you, Connor. I was hoping you’d like this one,” she winked as she held up her glass to mine.\\n\\n She was exquisite. The dress hugged her just like I’d pictured it would, framing her small petite body. Her soft curled hair was in an up do that featured her elongated neck as small diamond teardrop earrings hung perfectly from her ears. I subtly took in her scent as it filled the enclosed space we were in. Needless to say, it was arousing me. I could tell this was going to be a long night.\\n\\n Denny pulled up to the entrance of the hotel and got out to open Ellery’s door. I walked around to her side, took her hand, and helped her out of the limo. Her hand was warm and soft, and fire ignited throughout my body when I touched her.\\n\\n “Do you think that you can behave yourself tonight?” I smirked as I held my arm out to her.\\n\\n “I don’t know, but I can’t make any promises,” she smiled as she wrapped her arm in mine.\\n\\n We walked into the hotel and straight down the hallway to the Grand Ballroom. It was one of the most elegant ballrooms in New York. I need a drink, and I need one now.\\n\\n “What can I get you from the bar?” I asked.\\n\\n “I’ll take a glass of white wine, please.”\\n\\n I told her to wait at the table as I went to the bar and got our drinks. I gave her the glass of wine while I steadily drank my scotch and admired the most beautiful woman in the ballroom standing before me. I saw a good friend and colleague of mine, Robert and his wife, standing at the other side of the room. I lightly touched Ellery’s elbow and escorted her to where he and his wife were standing.\\n\\n “Good evening, Connor,” Robert said as we shook hands.\\n\\n “Hello, Robert, Courtney, I would like you to meet a friend of mine, Ellery Lane.”\\n\\n “You have beautiful friends, Connor,” he smiled as he lightly kissed Ellery’s hand.\\n\\n I gave a small smile and watched as Courtney eyed Ellery up and down. Courtney and I had a bit of a history, and it left her bitter. She fell hard and wanted more, but I had nothing to give. Robert put his arm around me and led me off to the side where the women couldn’t hear us.\\n\\n “Connor, Ashlyn is coming. I just thought you should know,” he said.\\n\\n “What? I thought I told you to make sure she wouldn’t be here,” I snapped.\\n\\n “I did make sure, but then she went and swooned George Frankel, and he fell all over the opportunity. You know how he is with beautiful women.”\\n\\n “Damn it,” I shook my head.\\n\\n We walked back to where Ellery and Courtney were standing. I put my hand on the small of Ellery’s back and escorted her back to the table. I needed to try and find Ashlyn before she saw Ellery. I pulled the chair out for her and excused myself to the restroom.\\n\\n I headed down the hallway and saw Ashlyn entering the ballroom with George. She saw me coming and smiled. I was angry at her and she knew it.\\n\\n “George, good to see you, buddy,” I smiled as I put my arm around him. “Why don’t you go to the bar and grab a drink for you and Ashlyn. She’ll meet you at the table, but first, I have something that I need to discuss with her.”\\n\\n He nodded his head and walked down the hallway till he reached the ballroom. As soon as he was out of sight, I turn to look at Ashlyn with a burning anger in my eyes.\\n\\n “What the hell are you doing here?!” I said through gritted teeth as I looked around to make sure nobody was watching.\\n\\n I backed her up against the wall. “Relax, Connor, George asked me if I’d like to accompany him, and I graciously accepted. Is there is a reason that you don’t want me here?”\\n\\n I looked away and then back at her. I grabbed her arm and led her around the corner. “I’m here with someone, and so help me, Ashlyn, if you even say one word to her – I swear…”\\n\\n “Don’t worry, Connor, I won’t spill our little secret to your new toy,” she devilishly grinned.\\n\\n I stared directly at her, and she knew I was pissed. “Are we clear, Ashlyn?”\\n\\n “Don’t worry, you’ve made yourself very clear,” she whispered.\\n\\n I turned around and headed back to the ballroom. As I approached the entrance, I noticed Ellery dancing with another man, and anger started to burn inside me. I walked out on the dance floor and tapped Andrew on the shoulder.\\n\\n “Excuse me, Andrew, but she’s here with me.”\\n\\n He gave me an apologetic look. “Mr. Black, I’m sorry. I didn’t know she was yours.”\\n\\n He stepped aside as I took his place, placing my hand on her waist and taking her hand in mine. Her hand was so soft, and it felt good to hold it.\\n\\n “I leave you alone for a minute, and you go off and dance with strange men? Is that what you call behaving?”\\n\\n She narrowed her eyes at me. “You left me alone to disappear with the woman who slapped you at Club S.”\\n\\n I looked at her in confusion. “You saw that?”\\n\\n She shook her head. “I think a lot of people saw that.”\\n\\n “So, let me get this straight, you saw me before you found me drunk outside?” I curiously asked.\\n\\n “Yes, I was sitting at the bar. Why do you ask?” she cocked her head.\\n\\n “Interesting,” I said as the corners of my mouth curved up.\\n\\n “What’s interesting?” She asked. “Oh, I get it now. You think I had my eyes set on you from the start.”\\n\\n I wickedly smiled at her, “Your words, Miss Lane, not mine.”\\n\\n She rolled her eyes and leaned closer into me, bringing her lips inches from my ear. I couldn’t help but take in her alluring scent as she whispered, “You are a delusional man, Mr. Black.”\\n\\n I closed my eyes for her scent was mesmerizing. She smelled like lilacs. This dance needed to end quickly or else she was going to get the wrong idea, if you know what I mean. She proceeded to ask me why I chose this charity to represent. This is something that’s very personal to me, and I didn’t feel the need to share something so personal with her. After all, we’re only friends.\\n\\n “May I ask why this specific charity?” she asked.\\n\\n “Why not this charity?” I vaguely asked.\\n\\n “Why did you though?” she continued.\\n\\n I looked straight ahead into the crowd. “It’s just a charity that my company is involved with. Why is it so important that you know a specific reason?”\\n\\n “Just forget I asked,” she said as she refused to look at me.\\n\\n “You’re mad,” I spoke.\\n\\n “You’ll know when I’m mad, Mr. Black,” she responded.\\n\\n The thoughts running through my head were sexual ones when she said that. I can’t help it, I’m a man, and that’s what we think about. Thank god the music ended when it did because there was no way of hiding my arousal any longer with our bodies pressed up against each other. I let go of her, placing my right hand in my pocket, and my other on the small of her back as we walked back to our table. I introduced her to some of my associates that were already sitting. I glanced over at the next table and saw Ashlyn glaring at Ellery. I shot her a warning look, and she turned away. We sat down and had dinner. I took the liberty of ordering Ellery the Filet since she needed to put some meat on her bones. I’m not sure if she appreciated that, but she did impress me by eating the whole piece. After dinner was over and we listened to a few speeches, Ellery excused herself to the restroom.\\n\\n I got up and headed to the bar to get Ellery another glass of wine and another scotch for myself. I walked back to the table and was surprised when she wasn’t back yet. I set the drinks on the table and walked to the restrooms. I leaned up against the wall opposite the ladies restroom and folded my arms. I was tempted to open the door and make sure she was in there. The thought of her being in trouble or just leaving because she was bored entered my mind. Suddenly, the door opened and Ellery looked startled when she saw me standing there.\\n\\n “Uh, hi? Why are you standing there like that?”\\n\\n “Because you’ve been gone for quite a while, and I was checking to make sure you’re ok. I was giving you five more seconds before I was opening the door and coming in after you.”\\n\\n “Wow, stalker much?” she said as she walked away.\\n\\n “For the last time, I’m not a stalker; I was concerned for your safety,” I sighed.\\n\\n I saw her lightly smile. Damn that smile. I have no idea what the hell is going on with me. I want to touch her, and I want to feel her bare skin against mine. Shit, this is not good. Maybe I made a mistake by bringing her here. Am I leading her on? We’re just friends, and I hope she understands that. I wanted to beat my head against a wall and knock some sense into it. I took in a deep breath. Ellery sat down and sipped her wine. I needed to speak with a friend of mine, so I told her I’d be right back. I walked a few feet away and talked to Paul about the company I was trying to acquire. My eyes kept wandering to her as she sat there and looked so beautiful. I watched her lips wrap around the edge of the wine glass with each sip she took as they left an imprint of her lipstick. Paul noticed me staring at Ellery.\\n\\n “Connor, you seem distracted,” he said as he turned around and looked Ellery’s way.\\n\\n “Sorry, Paul, I’m listening, please continue.”\\n\\n “I would be pleasantly distracted if I had that beautiful woman in my sights,” he smiled.\\n\\n “You know what, Paul? Let’s just continue this tomorrow. I have a meeting at 10 o’clock, but please call Valerie and have her set something up,” I said.\\n\\n He patted me on the back and walked away. I saw Ashlyn from across the room, eyeing Ellery. It was time that I got her out of here. I walked over to the table and lightly put my hand on her shoulder. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-9.html","bookId":1820,"book":{"id":1820,"title":"Forever You (Forever #2)","description":"Storyline: New York Times bestselling novel, Forever You is the highly demanded sequel to USA Today’s Bestseller, Forever Black. \\n Connor Black’s life consisted of his company and his use of multiple women.
