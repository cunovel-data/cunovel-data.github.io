Our wedding was taking place in the Conservatory Garden in Central Park. It’s something that Ellery has always dreamed of, and she was right; it was a beautiful place to get married, just as it was in her painting.\n It was a perfect day as the sun was shining brightly. When we arrived at the Conservatory Garden, people were already gathering and being seated as we walked through the Vanderbilt Gates. The rows of white chairs, decorated with bows made of tulle, were perfectly positioned. Beautiful flowers graced the aisle where a white runway was laid, leading down to an archway made of white magnolias that sat in front of a large fountain. Henry was to be my groomsman. Not only was Denny my best man, he was also walking Ellery down the aisle. I remember the day she asked him, and a tear formed in his eye as he said he’d be honored to give her away to me. I walked around and said hello to family and friends.\n “Connor,” my mom said as she walked over to me, “You look so handsome. I thought I’d never see this day,” she smiled.\n “I didn’t think that I would either, mom,” I said.\n My parents took their seats in the front row as Henry and I headed down the aisle to take our place in front of the archway. Denny stepped outside the gates to meet Ellery as her limo pulled up. Dr.\n Peters nodded and smiled as he and his wife sat down. I stood there next to Henry as a nervous wreck.\n “You’re not nervous; are you?” Henry asked.\n “I’m nervous as hell,” I replied.\n He put his hand on my shoulder. “Don’t be nervous. Ellery’s the woman of your dreams, and you’re finally making her your wife. You’re one lucky man, Connor.”\n I nervously smiled at him. “Just wait until you’re standing in my place, waiting for Peyton to walk down the aisle.”\n “Good point,” he said as he cocked his head to the side.\n The orchestra began playing as Peyton, Ellery’s maid of honor, slowly walked down the aisle. I looked at Henry as a wide grin spread across his face. She looked beautiful. Following behind her was Cassidy. She looked just as beautiful as she gracefully walked towards us with a smile on her face. I took in a deep breath as the wedding march started. My heart started racing when I saw Ellery holding the arm of my best friend. She looked exquisite in her wedding gown. Her hair was up in curls that were accented by her classic long veil. Her delicate hands carried a bouquet of pink roses and small white magnolias. As she slowly walked down the aisle, she never took her eyes off mine, and her smile captivated me. She was radiant, and the most beautiful woman in the world.\n She reached the archway as I stepped forward and Denny delicately placed her hand in mine. I smiled at her and saw some tears beginning to form. I lightly shook my head. She started to laugh as we stood there, holding hands, and we turned to the minister so he could begin the ceremony. He had us face each other to say our wedding vows. I took in a deep breath and stared into her beautiful blue eyes as I held her hands in mine.\n “Ellery, I didn’t write anything down because I didn’t have to. Every word I say to you is straight from my heart and soul. I want to start off by saying that you are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, and you look absolutely stunning. I feel like I’m the luckiest man alive to have you in my life, and not just as your best friend, but as your husband. You stole my heart from the moment you turned around and looked at me. The moment I saw your smile, I knew I was done for, and everything I thought I had believed in disappeared. You showed me love, and taught me that it was ok to love someone. We grew together as friends and then as lovers. Now, we will grow together as husband and wife. I promise to love you forever, and to never break your heart. I promise to keep you safe at all times. I promise you a world of happiness and joy, and I promise to take away your pain and sadness. You are my forever, Ellery Rose, and I love you more than words can express. You’ve been etched into my heart, and my heart is yours till death do us part. I will never love anyone as much as I love you.”\n Henry pulled the ring from his pocket and handed it to me. All I could hear were the sniffles of the guests as I slipped the delicate ring on her finger.\n “Take this ring as a symbol of my eternal love for you and for the start of our new life together. I love you, Ellery.” Tears fell down her face. I gently took my thumb and wiped them away as she said her vows.\n “Connor, you are the most amazing man that I’ve ever met. You stood by me, you fought for me, and you gave me the strength to fight through one of the toughest times of my life. You never gave up on me when you should have walked away. You believed in me and our relationship and I will never forget that. You are a kind-hearted, self-less man, and I’m the luckiest woman in the world to have found you. They say everyone is born with a purpose in this world. My purpose was to find you and to love you.” She let go of my hands and turned up her wrists. “The scars are gone because of you, and they’ve been replaced with love. You’ve put life back into my soul, and you’ve completed me. I will forever cherish this moment, and I will spend eternity thanking you and loving you.”\n Peyton handed her the ring. She took my finger and slowly slipped it on. “Take this ring as a symbol of my love and devotion to you as we start our new life together as one.”\n The minister smiled at us and he pronounced us husband and wife. I cupped her face in my hands as we shared our first kiss as husband and wife. The crowd stood up and clapped. We heard cheering as we turned and looked at the people who graciously attended our ceremony. I took her hand, and we walked down the aisle as Mr. and Mrs. Black, stopping in front of the Vanderbilt gates.\n “Hi, Mrs. Black,” I smiled as I softly kissed her lips.\n “Hi, Mr. Black,” she smiled back.\n Our moment alone didn’t last long as our guests soon followed. Waiters walked around with glasses of champagne for everyone. After the photographer took pictures of us in the different gardens, it was time to head to the reception. I took Ellery’s hand as we walked through the Vanderbilt gates where our horse and carriage were waiting. I helped Ellery up into the carriage and took my place beside her. We were taking a ride through Central Park for some alone time before heading to the reception.\n “Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?” I asked her as I stroked her cheek with my thumb.\n “I do, because you tell me every day,” she smiled.\n “And I will keep telling you every day because I love you, Mrs. Black. You are the most important thing in my life, and that will never change.” I leaned closer and kissed her softly.\n The reception took place in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. It was elegant as 700 people joined in the celebration in honor of our wedding day. We ate the finest food and drank the most expensive alcohol. No expense was spared when it came to Ellery. We greeted our guests and walked around the ballroom, engaging in conversation as people congratulated us with hugs and kisses. The band announced that it was time for our first dance. I only asked for one thing while planning this wedding and that was to pick our song. Ellery had agreed but threatened me that it better be perfect. I told her to trust me because I already had the perfect song in mind.\n I took her hand and led her to the dance floor as the song started. From the moment she heard the first line, tears formed in her eyes. “You’ll ruin your mascara if you start crying now,” I smiled.\n “You never cease to amaze me, Connor Black, and that’s why I love you so much. This song is perfect, and I couldn’t have picked anything better,” she said as one tear fell. I wiped away her tear and kissed her cheek.\n I wanted to get Ellery out of there and to her wedding present. We said goodbye to our family and friends as we climbed in the back of the limo, and I took out a blindfold from my pocket. Ellery looked at me and tilted her head.\n “Planning a little kinky time in the limo before we go back to the hotel?” She smiled.\n Ellery thought we were spending the night at the Waldorf. She didn’t know what I had planned for us. She didn’t even know about the limo until I told her we had to leave.\n “I’m taking you somewhere special, and it’s a surprise, so you need to wear this blindfold,” I said as I put it over her eyes.\n “Aren’t we spending the night at the hotel?”\n “No, Ellery, I have somewhere else in mind,” I said as my hand started traveling up her dress.\n “You are a very mysterious man, Mr. Black,” she moaned.\n We finally arrived at the house, and I couldn’t wait any longer for her to see it. I was reeling with excitement. “Are you ready, darling?” I asked as I took her hand.\n “Yes; I was ready forever ago,” she smiled.\n I helped her out of the limo. I removed the blindfold, and watched her gasp at what stood before her. “Connor, what is this?” she asked. I took her hand and led her to the porch.\n “This house is your wedding present. Do you like it?” I asked her as she stood there in shock.\n “Like it? I love it, but I don’t understand.”\n I smiled and gently kissed her lips. “This is our second home. We’ll spend our weekends and summers here.”\n I picked her up and carried through the door. I put her down as I led her to the back of the house.\n Tears started to roll down her face as she stepped out onto the deck and took in the beauty before her.\n “This is what I painted,” she softly spoke. I stood behind her and let her take it all in. She turned to me as I wiped away her tears.\n “You don’t have to say a word, Ellery, I know how much you love it; I can tell by the look on your face. This was built for you because I love you. I want to give you every dream you’ve ever dreamed, every happy moment you never had, every bit of love you’ve ever lost, and most importantly, a family. This home, our home, is my future with you, and we’re going to spend the rest of our lives making beautiful memories here.”\n She gulped as she cupped my face in her hands and stared deeply into my eyes. “I could never understand my purpose in this world. I’ve had nothing but pain and loss my whole life. But now I know why God saved me the first time. It was so I could find you. Then he saved me the second time so I could love you forever. This house is perfect; you’re perfect, and no one will ever take that away from us. Our love is infinite, and I’m going to spend the rest of my life showing you.”\n She pressed her lips against mine, and we fell into a deep, passionate kiss. I picked her up and carried her in the house. “Let’s get you out of this dress, Mrs. Black,” I smiled.\n Our wedding night was perfect. We spent many hours breaking in our new bed. Ellery was right; the wait was worth it.\n “Good morning, Mrs. Black,” I smiled as she laid herself in my arms.\n “Good morning, Mr. Black,” she snuggled closer to me.\n “We need to get up and get ready to leave for Paris,” I said as I looked at the clock. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-39.html","bookId":1820,"book":{"id":1820,"title":"Forever You (Forever #2)","description":"Storyline: \n New York Times bestselling novel, Forever You is the highly demanded sequel to USA Today’s Bestseller, Forever Black. \n Connor Black’s life consisted of his company and his use of multiple women.
