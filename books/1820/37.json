{"id":86162,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"I decided to begin working on Ellery’s wedding present. I want to give her the future she wants, and her painting, the Cape Cod house, is how she saw her future. The property was perfect. It was right on the beach just like in her painting. I hired rotating crews so the house and the property will be worked on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Ellery listened to me and decided to keep the painting rather than selling it. I told her that I would put it in storage for safekeeping until we found a place for it. I showed it to the builder and told him to replicate the painting exactly as is. The house and property have to be perfect for her as it represents our beginning and our forever.\\n\\n Chapter 27\\n\\n Dr. Murphy sent over a script to Dr. Taub so Ellery didn’t have to wait to get her blood work done.\\n\\n She had lengthy conversations with Dr. Taub during Ellery’s treatment period to ensure he was fully aware of everything going on. He told us that she should have the results in about three days. We flew to California the day before her results were supposed to come back. Ellery wanted to spend time with Mason and Landon. She seemed to be doing fine until I woke up at 3:00 am, and she was gone.\\n\\n I rolled over and opened my eyes; her side of the bed was empty. I got up and searched the apartment for her. Where the hell is she? I thought as I ran my hand through my hair. I picked up my phone and dialed her number, but it went straight to voicemail. I sighed as I put on a pair of jeans and a shirt. I grabbed my shoes and got in the Porsche. I sat there with my hands on the steering wheel, trying to figure out where she’d go. It’s 3:00 am, and she’s out in Los Angeles all alone. I was pissed now, because once again, she had no regard for her safety. Then it hit me; I drove to the beach, got out of the car, and started heading towards the water. I could see a shadow of someone sitting on the sand.\\n\\n “Ellery,” I called out. She turned and looked at me, then back at the water. She was sitting and hugging her legs against her chest.\\n\\n “I was worried when I woke up, and you were gone. Actually, Ellery, I was scared,” I said as I sat down next to her.\\n\\n “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to worry or scare you. I couldn’t sleep, and I needed to come here.”\\n\\n “Why didn’t you wake me up? I would’ve come with you. Did you walk here?” I asked in a commanding voice.\\n\\n “No, I called a cab, and I didn’t want to wake you. I just felt like I needed to be here, alone.”\\n\\n “Do you want me to leave then?” I asked her in an irritated voice.\\n\\n She grabbed my hand, “No, I want you to stay with me. I don’t want you to leave. I want you to watch the sunrise with me because it’ll be the start of a new day, and I’m scared to death of what this day’s going to bring.”\\n\\n I closed my eyes for a moment as I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her into me, holding her head against my chest. “You have nothing to fear, Ellery, because I’ll take care of you regardless of what the results show. I’m your lifeline, and I promise to give you a healthy life and future no matter the cost or sacrifice.” She lifted her head up and kissed me softly on the lips. She wasn’t the only one who was scared.\\n\\n We sat and held each other while we watched the sun rise over the ocean water. It’s amazing to share this experience with her, and it’s one that I’ll never forget. She looked up at me and smiled.\\n\\n “Let’s go home and make love before we see Dr. Murphy,” she requested.\\n\\n I picked her up and carried her across the sand. “It would be my pleasure to make love to you,” I smiled.\\n\\n I grabbed Ellery’s hand as we walked through the parking lot of the hospital. She was trying to put on a brave front, but I could see right through it. Denny had sent me a text, asking me to call him as soon as we receive the results. We were escorted into Dr. Murphy’s office and told to have a seat.\\n\\n Ellery kept bouncing her leg up and down. I put my hand on her knee to try and calm her down. Dr.\\n\\n Murphy walked through the door and looked at us.\\n\\n “How are you feeling today, Ellery?” she asked her. What the hell kind of question is that?! I wanted to say. How does she think she’s feeling?\\n\\n Ellery said that she was very nervous as Dr. Murphy sat down at her desk and opened Ellery’s file.\\n\\n She looked at her and then at me.\\n\\n “I am happy to report that the treatments worked, and you are in a full remission, Ellery Lane,” she smiled.\\n\\n My heart started racing; I couldn’t believe what I just heard. Ellery’s better; she’s healthy and in remission. Ellery put her hand over her mouth and began to cry.\\n\\n “Are you sure, Dr. Murphy?”\\n\\n “Ellery, I’m positive. You have a full and long life ahead of you,” she grinned.\\n\\n Ellery looked at me as we both stood up and hugged each other. “Thank you, Dr. Murphy, for everything,” I said.\\n\\n “Yes, thank you so much,” Ellery followed as she walked over and hugged the doctor.\\n\\n “You two go be happy, and enjoy your lives together,” she said as she walked out of her office.\\n\\n We left the hospital and went back to the apartment. The first thing Ellery did was tell Landon and Mason the good news. They wanted to go out and celebrate. I took out my phone and called Denny.\\n\\n Tears started to fill my eyes as I spoke to him.\\n\\n “She’s fine, Denny. The cancer is gone, and she’s in full remission.”\\n\\n “Connor, I’m so happy to hear the wonderful news. I’ll let Claire know. Give Ellery a hug and kiss from me, and tell her that I can’t wait to see her again.”\\n\\n “Thanks, Denny, I will.”\\n\\n I walked over and hugged her. “Denny told me to give you a hug and kiss from him,” I said as I kissed the top of her head. She smiled as I held her and wouldn’t let her go. I couldn’t let go of her even if I tried. I was so happy and thankful that she’s better, and now, we can move forward with our lives together.\\n\\n “Connor, you’re squeezing me just a little too tight,” she said.\\n\\n “I’m sorry, baby, but I can’t help it. I’m never letting you go, so get used to it.” I loosened my grip on her and stared into her happy, sparkling eyes. I unbuttoned her pants and slid them off her hips. She smiled at me as she stepped out of them. I lifted her shirt off and threw it on the floor. I picked her up as she wrapped her legs around me, and I set her on the kitchen counter.\\n\\n “I believe this is one spot where we haven’t had sex yet,” I smiled.\\n\\n “I don’t think we have, Mr. Black,” she replied with a grin.\\n\\n She unbuttoned my white cotton shirt and slid it off my shoulders. I kissed her on the lips before moving towards her neck. She still had her legs wrapped around me as I unhooked her bra and took it off her. My lips glided around her neck and down her to br**sts. She let out a moan as I took her hardened nipple in my mouth. She reached down and unbuttoned my pants, taking my erection in her hand. She had me so hot for her. My fingers trickled down to her panties as I grabbed the string on the side and tore them from her. “I promise I’ll buy you a new pair,” I moaned as I sucked her br**sts and my fingers slid inside her. I slid my fingers in and out of her as I stimulated her cl*t with my thumb, rubbing it in round circles as her moans grew louder, and her breathing became more rapid. She was incredibly wet, and I needed more of her. I let my fingers slip out of her as I took off my pants and boxers. I grabbed her legs and put them up on the counter so her feet were flat against it. I grabbed her and pulled her forward so her ass was hanging from the edge. I inserted myself in her as she wrapped her arms around my neck, and I brought my lips to hers. I moved in and out of her at a rapid pace until I brought her to the brink of an orgasm. She was ready; her nails clawed down my back and into my ass as I gave one more thrust, and we both came at the same time. I let out a loud groan as I gave a final thrust into her and finished off. I put my hands on the sides of her face as I stared into her beautiful, dancing eyes.\\n\\n “I love you so much, and I’m so happy everything turned out right today. I was so scared for you, Ellery,” I said as my eyes swelled with tears.\\n\\n She tilted her head and wiped away the tears that were falling down my face. “I know, babe, and I’m so sorry I put you through that. But we have our whole life in front of us, and we need to set a wedding date. I can’t wait to marry you and become Mrs. Ellery Black,” she smiled. I picked her up from the counter and held her firmly by her ass as I kissed her and carried her to the bedroom for round two.\\n\\n We said goodbye to Mason and Landon as they drove us to the airport. All three of them cried as we said our goodbyes. I looked at Mason and Landon seriously.\\n\\n “When the two of you come to New York, which I know will be frequently to see Ellery; you are to call me first to let me know because I’ll send the company plane to get you. I don’t want you flying commercial.”\\n\\n Ellery smiled at me as both Landon and Mason agreed. They were such good friends to Ellery when she first came to California, and I know she considers them family. I do as well; they’re a couple of great guys, and I owe them a lot. We boarded the plane, and Ellery took her usual seat by the window. I sat down next to her as she took my hand and kissed it.\\n\\n “June 15th,” she smiled.\\n\\n I looked at her in confusion. “June 15th? What’s on June 15th?” I asked.\\n\\n “That’s our wedding day,” she said as she kissed me.\\n\\n I smiled and took her face in my hands. “June 15th is a perfect day to marry you.” I leaned over and kissed her. I was happy she finally chose a date. I better get in touch with the builder and the contractors to make sure the house is done before then.\\n\\n We landed in New York at 7:00 pm. There was a surprise waiting for Ellery at the penthouse when we arrive. She doesn’t know it, but I’ve arranged to have a small party for her to celebrate the good news. I had Claire, Peyton, Cassidy, and my mom put it together. Knowing all of them, I imagine the party will be overdone. Denny picked us up from the airport, and Ellery ran straight to him. We slid in the back of the limo and headed to the penthouse. When the elevator doors opened, the penthouse was dark. Suddenly, the lights turned on and everyone yelled surprise. Ellery’s eye widened, and she looked at me. I kissed her cheek and let her tend to her guests. I walked around the penthouse, and just as I thought, it was overdone, but it was nice; every time I glanced over at Ellery, she was smiling.\\n\\n Damn that smile. I grabbed a glass of Champagne as my mom walked over to me.\\n\\n “Connor, darling, I’m so happy for you and Ellery. I could only imagine what you must be feeling right now,” she said as she hugged me.\\n\\n “I’m feeling extremely happy, mom. I can’t even explain it to you.”\\n\\n “Do the two of you have any other news that you may want to share with me?” she smiled.\\n\\n Ellery came walking over to us and put her arm around me. “Don’t you think now would be the perfect opportunity to tell everybody that we’ve set the wedding date?” I whispered to her.\\n\\n “Yes, it’s the perfect time, so let’s do it,” she excitedly replied. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-37.html","bookId":1820,"book":{"id":1820,"title":"Forever You (Forever #2)","description":"Storyline: New York Times bestselling novel, Forever You is the highly demanded sequel to USA Today’s Bestseller, Forever Black. \\n Connor Black’s life consisted of his company and his use of multiple women.
