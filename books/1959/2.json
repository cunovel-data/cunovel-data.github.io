{"id":69500,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Once again she grumbled under her breath, seriously considering leaving the base without running. If she did go down to the track, it was likely she\u0027d say or do something that would get her into trouble with the commander.\n Evidently she\u0027d done something horrible to warrant his dislike. After he\u0027d ruined four weekends straight for her, he\u0027d topped himself by giving her the least desirable assignment on base. What next? KP?\n Catherine started to turn away, then abruptly changed her mind. She wasn\u0027t going to allow this man to dictate her entire life! She had as much right to run on this track as anyone. If he didn\u0027t like it, he could be the one to leave.\n With that thought in mind, she stepped alongside the court and went through a series of warm-up exercises. Actually, the more she thought about it, she was downright eager to get onto the track. She was petite, but she was a fine runner. She\u0027d been on the varsity cross-country teams in both high school and college and did a consistent seven-minute mile. If there was an area in which she excelled, it was running.\n She did the first lap at a relaxed pace, easily lapping a couple of the overweight men. Commander Nyland didn\u0027t acknowledge her one way or the other, which was perfectly fine with Catherine. She\u0027d hadn\u0027t come out here to exchange pleasantries with him.\n The second and third laps, Catherine stepped up her pace. It normally took her a mile or so to fully warm up. As she increased her stride, she noticed that she was never quite able to catch her XO.\n The one time she did manage to pass him, he scooted past her seconds later, leaving her to eat his dust. Frustrated, Catherine decided she might not be able to outrun him, but by heaven she\u0027d outlast him. He was fast, but she\u0027d easily outdistance him.\n She continued her killing pace until she was sure she\u0027d gone six miles or farther. Her lungs ached, and her calf muscles strenuously protested the abuse. Yet she continued, more determined than ever not to surrender her pride to this disagreeable commander. If she was hurting, then so was he.\n She would rather keel over from exhaustion than quit now! It was more than a matter of pride.\n Soon fat raindrops fell from the darkening sky and splashed against the dry, gritty surface. Still Catherine and the commander ran. What few runners remained quickly dropped out until it was the two of them alone against the forces of nature. Against each other, in a silent battle of wills.\n They didn\u0027t speak. Not once. Catherine ran until she thought she was going to be sick, yet she dared not stop. Night fell like a curtain of black satin around the grounds. Catherine barely managed to see her own feet, let alone the distant silhouette of the commander. Soon he disappeared from her range of view entirely. It wasn\u0027t until she heard his footsteps coming up behind her that she realized he\u0027d been able to come all the way around to lap her. He slowed his pace until his steps matched her own without breaking his stride.\n \"How much longer are we going to keep this up, Fredrickson?\" he demanded.\n Damn, he didn\u0027t even sound out of breath, Catherine noted.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she returned, sounding very much as though she should have yielded several miles back.\n \"You\u0027re tiring.\"\n How kind of him to tell her so. \"You are, too,\" she insisted.\n \"I have to admit you\u0027re a hell of a runner.\"\n \"A compliment, Commander?\"\n She sensed his smile. It made absolutely no sense the way her heart reacted knowing that. It was as if she\u0027d been blessed by an unexpected second wind. By some odd twist of fate, she\u0027d actually managed to amuse ol\u0027 stone face.\n \"Don\u0027t let it go to your head.\"\n \"No chance of that,\" she quipped, wondering if she\u0027d heard a hint of amusement in his tone. \"I don\u0027t suppose you happened to notice it\u0027s raining.\" Although she attempted to make light of it, she was drenched to the bone.\n \"Is that what all this wet stuff is?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what,\" she said between breaths, \"I\u0027ll stop running if you do. We\u0027ll call it a draw.\"\n \"Agreed.\" Royce slowed his pace to a trot, and Catherine reluctantly did the same, not sure even now that she could trust him. After several steps, she stopped and leaned over, bracing her hands on her knees while she struggled to capture her breath.\n The rain continued to pound down with a vengeance. While they were jogging, it was a simple enough matter to ignore the downpour. Now it wasn\u0027t so easy. Her hair, which had once been neatly secured at her nape, was plastered to her cheeks like wet strings. A small river of rainwater was navigating over her neck and down to the small of her back.\n \"Go home, Fredrickson,\" Royce said after a moment.\n Catherine bristled. \"Is that an order?\"\n He paused. \"No.\"\n He started to walk away from her, then unexpectedly turned back. \"Before you leave, satisfy a curiosity. You requested a transfer from San Diego several years back. Why?\"\n Catherine knew it was all part of her personnel file, but his question caught her off guard. Her response was quick, light-hearted, almost flippant. \"Who wouldn\u0027t want to live in Hawaii?\"\n \"That wasn\u0027t the reason you wanted out of San Diego.\" His voice was deceptively unconcerned, as if he knew far more than he was letting on. \"You wanted that transfer and you didn\u0027t care if you got Hawaii or Iran.\"\n \"There were personal reasons,\" she admitted reluctantly. Catherine couldn\u0027t understand why he\u0027d chosen to ask her these questions now. The man continued to baffle her.\n \"Tell me the truth.\"\n Catherine tensed, disliking his casual tone. Nor was she pleased with the way he implied she was lying. By mentally counting to ten, she willed herself to remain calm.\n \"That is the truth. I\u0027ve always wanted to live in Hawaii.\"\n \"My guess is that a man was involved.\"\n Catherine\u0027s stomach knotted. She didnft often think about Aaron. For the past three years she\u0027d done a superb job of pretending they\u0027d never met. Leave it to Royce Nyland to harass her battered heart with memories of her former fiance. All right, that was a bit strong. He wasn\u0027t exactly tormenting her, and her heart wasn\u0027t all that scarred.\n \"What makes you think my request had anything to do with a man?\" she asked, making light of his comment. She increased her strides, wanting to get this interrogation over with as soon as possible.\n \"Because it generally is.\"\n That wasn\u0027t the least bit true, but Catherine wasn\u0027t going to stand in the rain and argue with him.\n \"A change of scenery appealed to me at the time.\" She needed to get away from San Diego for fear she\u0027d run into Aaron. She wouldn\u0027t have been able to bear seeing him again. At least that was what she told herself. Over time, she wasn\u0027t nearly convinced that was true. She\u0027d fallen head over heels in love with him much too quickly. Then she\u0027d flown out as a defense attorney for trials aboard the Nimitz and returned several weeks later to learn Aaron hadn\u0027t exactly been holding his breath waiting for her.\n The first minute she was back, Catherine had rushed to her fiance\u0027s apartment to find him lying on the sofa with the young blond divorcee who lived next door. Aaron had scrambled off the davenport in a rush to explain while the red-faced divorcee hastily rebuttoned her blouse. It had all been innocent fun, Aaron claimed. Hell, how was he supposed to amuse himself while she was away for weeks on end? He advised Catherine to be a sport since he and the blonde had only indulged in a little entertainment.\n In thinking back over the episode, Catherine was surprised by how completely emotionless she\u0027d remained. The solitary diamond on her finger suddenly weighted down her hand. That much she remembered with ease. She\u0027d stared down on it and then wordlessly slipped it from her finger and returned it to Aaron. For several moments he was paralyzed with shock. Then he\u0027d followed her to the parking lot and pleaded with her to be more understanding. If it offended her so much, he\u0027d make sure it didn\u0027t happen again. There was no need to overreact this way. None whatsoever.\n In retrospect Catherine had come to realize that her pride had taken far more of a beating than her heart. She was almost relieved to have Aaron out of her life, only she hadn\u0027t realized that until much later.\n \"Catherine?\"\n Royce\u0027s deep, masculine voice pulled her back into the present. To the best of her knowledge it was the first time he\u0027d ever used her name. Until then it had been Lieutenant Commander or Fredrickson, but never Catherine. This, too, had a curious effect upon her heart.\n \"There was a man involved,\" she announced stiffly, \"but that was several years ago now. You needn\u0027t worry my former engagement will affect my work for you. Now or in the future.\"\n \"I\u0027m pleased to hear it.\"\n \"Good night, Commander.\" They crested the hill where Catherine\u0027s bright red GEO Storm was waiting for her.\n \"Good night.\"\n Trotting, Catherine was halfway down the hill when Royce stopped her.\n \"Catherine.\"\n \"Yes?\" She turned around to face him, brushing the wet curls from her cheeks.\n \"Are you living with someone?\"\n The question took her by complete surprise. \"That\u0027s none of your business.\"\n Royce said nothing. He stood several feet away from her, his harsh features illuminated by the streetlight. His face was tight, as if he were holding himself in check. \"Trust me, I have no interest in your love life. You can live with whomever you please or be engaged to five men at once for all I care. What does concern me is the legal department.\n The work is demanding and the schedule grueling. I like to know where I stand with my staff and try to avoid causing unnecessary complications in their lives.\"\n Catherine didn\u0027t respond right away. \"Since you find it so important, then I might as well confess I am shacked up with someone.\" From the distance Catherine couldn\u0027t tell if she got a reaction or not. Most likely he was telling the truth and he didn\u0027t care one way or the other. \"Sambo.\"\n \"Sambo?\" he repeated frowning.\n \"You heard me correctly, Commander. I live with a cat named Sambo.\" With that, she gave a cheerful laugh and was gone.\n Royce found himself smiling in the dark, the rain pelting down around him in a great torrent. His amusement, however, vanished quickly. He didn\u0027t like Catherine Fredrickson.\n \"No,\" he muttered aloud, retracting the thought. That wasn\u0027t true. He did like her. There were any number of admirable traits about the Lieutenant Commander he couldn\u0027t help but respect.\n She was dedicated and hardworking, and she\u0027d fit in easily with the rest of his staff. She wasn\u0027t a complainer, either. Before he\u0027d left the office that evening, he\u0027d checked over the duty roster and was surprised to note that he\u0027d assigned Catherine duty every Friday for four weeks running. He hadn\u0027t realized his mistake. Anyone else would have pointed it out to him, and rightly so. Her name had drifted easily into his mind when he learned Lieutenant Osborne was going on sea trials and a substitute coordinator was needed to take over the physical fitness program.\n He knew Catherine wasn\u0027t overly pleased by the assignment. Her eyes had flashed briefly with rebellion, but that was the only outward sign she\u0027d given that she wasn\u0027t thrilled with the added responsibility.\n That woman had eyes that would mark a man\u0027s soul. Normally Royce didn\u0027t pay much attention to that sort of thing, but her eyes had garnered his attention from the first moment they\u0027d met. They shimmered, and seemed to trap pieces of light. But more than that, they seemed warm and caring. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-woman-navy-4/page-2.html","bookId":1959,"book":{"id":1959,"title":"Navy Woman (Navy #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Navy Woman (Navy Series #4) \n Despite the strictly taboo laws of naval fraternizing, navy attorney Catherine Fredrickson and her new boss, Royce Nyland, find themselves strongly attracted.
