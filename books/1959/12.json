{"id":69510,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Royce didn\u0027t know what the hell he\u0027d been thinking. That was just it. He wasn \u0027t thinking. Thank God Catherine had the presence of mind to call an end to matters when she had. She was right. If they made love, neither one of them would have been able to continue with the pretense. True, Catherine was far more readable than he was, but Royce knew himself well enough to recognize there would be problems with him, too. Major problems. \"Can I call Catherine?\" Kelly asked, reaching across the table for the comics. \"I don\u0027t think that would be a good idea.\" \"Why not?\" Royce wasn\u0027t in any mood to argue with his daughter, and his voice was sharp when he spoke. \"Because I said you couldn\u0027t. I don\u0027t want any arguments about this, Kelly. Catherine is off-limits.\" To them both, unfortunately. Kelly gave him an indignant look, scooted out of her chair and stalked out of the kitchen. Just before she reached the doorway, she bolted around and glared at him. \"Sometimes you\u0027re an unreasonable grouch.\" If Kelly thought he was bad now, give him another six months of working side by side with Catherine, knowing he\u0027d never be able to hold her or kiss her again. \"What\u0027s with Commander Nyland?\" Elaine Perkins questioned when Catherine returned from a session in court early Friday afternoon. Catherine had been in and out of the office all week acting as prosecutor on a series of criminal trials. If Royce\u0027s mood had been anything other than normal, she hadn\u0027t noticed. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" she asked, setting a load of files down on her desk. \"If I knew that I wouldn\u0027t be asking you. He\u0027s been in a bad mood all week, making unreasonable demands on himself and everyone else. You would think once he found out his daughter wasn\u0027t badly hurt he\u0027d be in a good mood. If anything it\u0027s gotten worse.\" \"If Commander Nyland has a problem, trust me, he isn\u0027t going to share it with me.\" Catherine did her best to maintain the pretense that she and Royce did nothing more than work together. She hadn\u0027t talked to him outside the office all week. The fact didn\u0027t trouble her; they both needed distance to put order to their thoughts. Now that she thought about it, Catherine was willing to admit that Elaine did have a point. Royce seemed to be putting in plenty of hours, making too many demands on himself and consequently everyone else. He\u0027d never gone out for any personality awards, nor was he in a popularity contest. If that were the case he\u0027d lose hands down. A couple of the other clerks rolled back their chairs. \"Ever read much about arctic seals, Lieutenant Commander?\" Elaine Perkins asked as the others slowly gathered around the secretary\u0027s desk. \"No.\" Catherine wondered what the men were up to. \"Apparendy when danger is near they gather on a floating iceberg. The problem is they don\u0027t know when the danger has passed and so a sacrificial seal is thrown into the water. If he survives the others know it\u0027s safe to leave the iceberg.\" Catherine stared at the small party of men gathered around Elaine\u0027s desk. A couple had leaned forward, pressing their hands to her desktop. \"So?\" Catherine demanded, not liking the sounds of this. \"We just voted you to be our sacrificial seal.\" \"What?\" If she hadn\u0027t been so amused, she might have been concerned. Apparendy she hadn\u0027t done as good a job as she\u0027d hoped, hiding her feelings for Royce. The staff seemed to think she had some influence with their XO. A dangerous sign. \"It makes sense for you to be the one to approach him,\" Elaine explained before Catherine could ask why they\u0027d bestowed the dubious honor upon her. \"Commander Nyland may have all the sensitivity of seaweed, but he\u0027s still a man, and as such he\u0027s as susceptible as the rest of us to a pretty face.\" \"And what exactly am I supposed to say to him?\" \"I don\u0027t have a clue. You\u0027re supposed to figure that out yourself. Just do whatever it is you do to put a man into a better mood.\" \"Please do it soon,\" Seaman Webster added. \"I\u0027ve had to type the same paper five times. He wants it perfect. The last time I had a comma out of place, and you would have thought the free world was in jeopardy.\" \"Sorry, fellows,\" Catherine said, walking back into her office, ignoring them as much as possible. She was staying away from this situation with Royce with a ten-foot pole. \"You picked the wrong lady to do your dirty work for you. If Commander Nyland\u0027s in a foul mood, you\u0027ll ride it out together the way you always have. Furthermore I find your attitude highly chauvinistic.\" \"Oh, I agree,\" Elaine Perkins commented. \"But we\u0027re desperate.\" \"I said no,\" she returned crisply. \"And I mean it.\" There was a fair amount of grumbling, but the staff gradually returned to their desks. Elaine Perkins, however, continued to study Catherine. \"I thought you and the commander were friends.\" \"We are,\" Catherine said, doing her best to keep her tone light and unaffected. \"I understood that the two of you jogged together most afternoons.\" Catherine wondered when she\u0027d heard that and from whom. \"Not anymore. I usually run in the mornings.\" \"Damn. I was hoping you might be able to talk to him casually some afternoon, find out what\u0027s bugging him. There isn\u0027t any need to make the rest of us suffer just because he\u0027s unhappy about something.\" \"Are you suffering, Mrs. Perkins?\" Royce demanded from behind Catherine\u0027s secretary in a voice so cold, the words froze in midair. Elaine went pale. \"No, sir,\" she answered briskly. \"I\u0027m glad to hear it.\" He hesitated long enough to look toward Catherine. \"I\u0027d like the Ellison report on my desk before you leave tonight.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Catherine returned just as crisply. She was hours from being anywhere close to finishing the report. Royce must have known it. Apparently she, too, was to receive the brunt of his foul mood, but then why should she be different from anyone else? With that, Royce returned to his office and closed the door. Elaine slumped back into her chair and released her breath in a slow exercise. \"He wants you to have that report done by tonight?\" she moaned. \"Don\u0027t worry, it won\u0027t take me long.\" Longer than she would have liked, but that couldn\u0027t be helped. \"Do you want me to stay and type it up for you?\" Catherine appreciated the offer, but it wasn\u0027t necessary. \"No, thanks, it won\u0027t take me long.\" \"Aren\u0027t you furious with him?\" Elaine asked under her breath, her gaze leveled on the closed door that led to Royce\u0027s office. \"No.\" Maybe she should be, but Catherine had learned long before that Royce\u0027s bark was far worse than his bite. She said as much to Elaine. \"Right, but you don\u0027t seem to be the one he\u0027s biting all the time.\" The humor drained out of Catherine. The more she thought about Elaine\u0027s comment, the more concerned she became. Was it true? Had Royce given her more slack than the other members of his staff? Apparently they\u0027d all felt the brunt of his bad mood in the past several days. But if what Elaine Perkins said was true, something had to be done, and quickly. Catherine waited until later that same afternoon when Royce went down to the track. She gave him enough time to run several laps before she joined him. He looked over at her and frowned, his look so dark and uninviting that a shiver of apprehension moved over her. \"The Ellison report is on your desk.\" \"Is there a problem?\" He hadn\u0027t decreased his speed any, and she was having a problem maintaining his pace. \"Ah...ever hear of a sacrificial seal?\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"Nothing...forget I said that.\" They ran half a lap, then he turned to stare at her again. His eyes were cold, his look detached. That should have pleased her, should have assured her Elaine was imagining things, but it didn\u0027t. \"We might have a problem.\" \"Is that a fact, Lieutenant Commander? Thank you so much for taking it upon yourself to inform me of this.\" \"More than...the usual problem.\" \"And what, tell me, is the usual problem?\" \"There isn\u0027t any need to be so damned sarcastic,\" she said, affronted by his attitude. \"Isn\u0027t there?\" he returned. \"What do I have to do, order you off this track? I thought I\u0027d made myself clear about the subject of us jogging together.\" \"You did, but...\" \"Then kindly respect my wishes.\" The wall was back in place, so firmly erected that Catherine was left to wonder if everything that had blossomed between them was a figment of her imagination. Royce was so cold. So caustic. \"What about my wishes?\" she asked softly. Royce came to an abrupt halt. His blue eyes had never been more piercing. \"Listen, Lieutenant Commander, you have no wishes. If you didn\u0027t learn that early in your Navy career then we have a real problem. I\u0027m your executive officer. You will do what I say, when I say it, without question. Is that understood?\" Catherine swallowed back a cry of protest. She blinked and nodded. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Good. Now stay off this track from five o\u0027clock on.\" He made it sound like a direct order, when in fact he had no right to tell her when she could or couldn\u0027t be on the track, \"Is that clear?\" he demanded. \"Very clear, sir.\" The \"sir\" was shouted. \"Good.\" There was no regret in his voice. No emotion. Only a wall so high and so thick, Catherine doubted she\u0027d ever be able to scale its heights again. Chapter Six The phone was ringing when Catherine let herself into her apartment Saturday afternoon. Setting the bag of groceries on the kitchen counter and ignoring Sambo\u0027s protest over being ignored, she lurched for the receiver. \"Hello,\" she said, fighting breathlessness. \"Hi.\" It was Kelly, that much Catherine could tell, but it sounded like Royce\u0027s daughter was talking with her head inside a bucket. \"Kelly?\" \"Yeah, it\u0027s me.\" \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"Nothing. It\u0027s just that I\u0027m not supposed to be calling you, and if Dad finds out I\u0027m in big trouble. I\u0027ve got the phone cord stretched into the closet and I\u0027m whispering as loud as I can. Can you hear me all right?\" \"Just barely. Now tell me what\u0027s up.\" Catherine did her best to ignore the pain of Royce\u0027s most recent order. \"You still like me and my Dad, don\u0027t you?\" \"Oh, yes, sweetheart, of course I do.\" But it was more complicated than that, and Catherine couldn\u0027t allow the youngster to go on thinking matters could continue the way they had. \"There are problems, though.\" \"I know, Dad explained everything to me.\" Kelly paused, and Catherine could hear the frustration and disappointment hum over the telephone wire with every word the youngster spoke. \"Sometimes I hate the Navy.\" \"Don\u0027t,\" Catherine pleaded softly. \"Those rules were made for a very good reason.\" \"But Dad said we couldn\u0027t have you over to the house anymore and that we couldn\u0027t go to the movies or go out to dinner or things like that. He said it would be best if I forgot all about you because that was what he was going to do.\" Kelly\u0027s words went through Catherine like a steel point. The pain was so sharp and so real that she swallowed hard and bit her lower lip.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-woman-navy-4/page-12.html","bookId":1959,"book":{"id":1959,"title":"Navy Woman (Navy #4)","description":"Storyline: Navy Woman (Navy Series #4) Despite the strictly taboo laws of naval fraternizing, navy attorney Catherine Fredrickson and her new boss, Royce Nyland, find themselves strongly attracted.
