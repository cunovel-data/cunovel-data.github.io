The whole thing has to be handled delicately.\"\\n\\n \"Of course. But once you\u0027re married, the Navy wouldn\u0027t separate a husband and wife, will it?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re joking, Mom?\" Catherine asked with a light laugh. \"I thought you knew the military better than that. The Navy does what\u0027s most convenient for the Navy. Royce and I have no right falling in love in the first place.\"\\n\\n \"But he\u0027ll be in Virginia, and you might well end up stationed in Washington.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know that yet. Royce is pulling every string he can to make sure that doesn\u0027t happen. Even if worse comes to worse and I do have to stay here, it won\u0027t be forever. Eventually we\u0027ll be together.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like the sound of this, Catherine,\" her mother said in low, concerned tones.\\n\\n \"Trust me, it\u0027s essential for right now.\"\\n\\n \"Not necessarily. Sweetheart, don\u0027t you think you should consider resigning from the Navy?\"\\n\\n It was an argument Catherine had been having with herself for several days. She\u0027d talked it over with Royce, and they\u0027d batted the idea back and forth several times, but she\u0027d been adamant and he hadn\u0027t pressured her. \"I\u0027m not leaving the Navy,\" she argued forcibly with her mother. \"I\u0027m not giving up my career just because I happened to fall in love.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll always be an attorney, and frankly, I\u0027ve never understood why you don\u0027t simply join a law firm, you\u0027d do much better financially.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s an old argument and not one I\u0027m going to get involved with now. I\u0027ve come too far to resign now. Besides, of all the people in the world, I would have thought you\u0027d understand my feelings about the Navy. Resigning isn\u0027t even up for consideration. Royce knows that and accepts it.\"\\n\\n \"But, Catherine, sweetheart, be reasonable, what man wants to be separated from his wife by thousands of miles?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re making it sound like a foregone conclusion that I won\u0027t be transferred with him. In every likelihood I will, so quit worrying about it,\" Catherine stated heatedly. She immediately felt contrite. Her mother wasn\u0027t telling her something she hadn\u0027t already debated long and hard. The Navy was important to both her and Royce. Catherine noted, however, that no one suggested he resign his commission and become a civilian because he wanted to marry her.\\n\\n \"What about children?\"\\n\\n \"Mom, I don\u0027t think we\u0027re gong to accomplish anything productive going over this now. I\u0027ve got less than two weeks to make all the necessary arrangements. Royce is detaching from his command here, which helps. Can you send us whatever it is we need to file for a wedding license in California?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\" But her mother was right. What about children? Catherine didn\u0027t know if she was being greedy to want it all. A career, a family and the Navy. That was a question she had yet to face.\\n\\n The next few days passed in a whirlwind of frantic activity. Catherine barely saw Royce, barely talked to him. Late in the week he and Kelly flew to Virginia to make the necessary arrangements for housing.\\n\\n Friday after work, Catherine returned to her apartment in a haze of concern. Over the next two days she spent hours on the phone with her mother, arranging for the florists, photographers and trying on every wedding dress within two counties.\\n\\n Royce called her late Sunday evening. \"Hello, beautiful,\" he greeted in a soft, sexy voice that curled her toes.\\n\\n She was exhausted physically and mentally. \"Hello yourself,\" she answered, fighting back a powerful need to have his arms around her. Instead she forced herself to ask all the right questions. \"Did you and Kelly find a house?\"\\n\\n \"Within the first day. It\u0027s perfect. Three bedrooms, nice family room, a large kitchen and all for a reasonable rent.\" Royce hadn\u0027t been able to obtain housing on the base, which made the move just a little more difficult. Kelly had considered it important to accompany him on this trip so she could scout out the schools and choose the right kind of neighborhood, which meant one with lots of girls her age.\\n\\n \"What did Kelly think of Virginia?\"\\n\\n \"It was radical this and radical that. At least that\u0027s what I seem to remember her saying. Right now everything\u0027s new and fun. I don\u0027t think she\u0027s going to have any problems making the adjustment.\"\\n\\n Catherine snuggled up on the sofa, the phone cord stretched as far as it would go from the kitchen wall. Her gaze rested on the photograph of her father, lingering there for several moments. \"Kelly\u0027s going to be making a whole lot of adjustments in the next few weeks.\" It worried Catherine that Royce\u0027s daughter was suffering the brunt of the sacrifices they each were forced into making for this marriage.\\n\\n \"Kelly\u0027s resilient. Trust me, she would have willingly moved to the jungles of darkest Africa if it meant you were going to be part of our family.\"\\n\\n \"I love you.\" Catherine felt the need to say it. It suddenly seemed important for her to voice her feelings.\\n\\n \"I love you, too.\" After the hectic craziness that had surrounded them for what seemed like months on end, it was good to sit in the solitude of her home and cherish the words she\u0027d longed to hear for so many weeks.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want to love you, at least not at first,\" Royce admitted roughly. \"God knows I tried to stay away from you.\"\\n\\n \"I tried, too.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d give anything to have you in my arms right now.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all going to change soon, and I\u0027ll be in your arms for the rest of our lives.\" She said it as a reminder to herself, wiping the moisture from her cheek. She should be the happiest woman in the world. Within a matter of days she and Royce would be man and wife. Yet the envelope sitting on the corner of her desk was a constant reminder of how quickly that happiness could be tarnished.\\n\\n Royce paused, and although he must be exhausted, Catherine realized he\u0027d picked up on the fact she\\n\\n was miserably unhappy. She tried so hard to hide it behind busy questions and a cheerful facade.\\n\\n \"Are you going to tell me?\" he demanded softly.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no need to spoil everything now. You\u0027ll find out soon enough.... You\u0027re back safe and sound, and that\u0027s what matters. Mission accomplished. Kelly\u0027s happy. What more could you possibly want?\"\\n\\n \"You.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, my darling, you have me. You\u0027ve held on to my heart for weeks on end, don\u0027t you know that?\"\\n\\n \"I already know, Catherine,\" he told her softly. \"You don\u0027t need to hide it from me.\"\\n\\n She sucked in her breath. \"When did you find out?\"\\n\\n \"Friday before I left.\"\\n\\n Her request for transfer had been denied. The worst scenario. Her worst nightmare. She was going to be stationed in Bangor while Royce and Kelly were on the other side of the country.\\n\\n \"Oh, Royce,\" she asked softly, \"what are we going to do?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly what we\u0027re planning. I\u0027m marrying you, Catherine, come hell or high water.\"\\n\\n Chapter Twelve\\n\\n The wedding ceremony took place Friday evening in a small San Francisco chapel with the pastor from Marilyn Fredrickson-Morgan\u0027s church. The altar was decorated with brilliant red poinsettias, and although Royce wasn\u0027t much into flowers, he was impressed with the traditional Christmas flower that crowded every square inch of floor space around the altar. Catherine and her mother had done a beautiful job. Even Kelly who\u0027d first suggested a pink color scheme approved of the festive red bows and other complements.\\n\\n As for the ceremony itself, Royce remembered little of what progressed. The moment he\u0027d stepped over to join the reverend and viewed Catherine slowly marching down the aisle toward him, he\u0027d been so lost in her loveliness that everything else around him had faded.\\n\\n Even the small reception afterward with both families and a few close friends remained hazy in his mind. Catherine fed him a piece of heart-shaped cake bordered with red roses and sipped champagne. They even danced a couple of times.\\n\\n There had been gifts, too. Royce couldn\u0027t get over how many when there were less than fifty people at the entire wedding.\\n\\n Kelly had been in her element. Royce\u0027s parents had flown in from Arizona, along with a couple of his aunts and uncles. Even his younger brother and his family had managed to make it up from the southern part of the state. Kelly had basked in all the attention. She\u0027d taken to Marilyn and Norman almost as quickly as she\u0027d taken to Catherine herself.\\n\\n His daughter delighted in announcing to any and everyone who would listen that he and Catherine owed everything to her. She\u0027d also sounded like something of a parole officer when she admitted to Catherine\u0027s mother that she\u0027d personally seen to it that no hanky-panky had been allowed before the wedding ceremony.\\n\\n At the moment Catherine was changing clothes, something she\u0027d done once or twice already since the wedding. He couldn\u0027t understand why she insisted on dressing when he fully intended on undressing her the minute they arrived at the hotel room he\u0027d booked.\\n\\n Royce would much rather have chosen someplace romantic for their honeymoon. Unfortunately they weren\u0027t going to have a whole lot of time together before he assumed his duties in Virginia. With a limited time schedule, Royce quickly decided he\u0027d rather spend it in bed with Catherine than on the road seeking out the perfect romantic hideaway.\\n\\n A private room on one of the beaches might have worked out nicely, but the San Francisco hotel offered one advantage the others didn\u0027t. Room service.\\n\\n Royce had two short days with Catherine, and he sure as hell didn\u0027t plan on spending any of it sightseeing.\\n\\n It seemed to take the taxi forever to reach the hotel. They chatted about the wedding, teased and even managed to kiss a couple of times. It wasn\u0027t until they\u0027d registered and were on their way up to the honeymoon suite that it hit Royce.\\n\\n He was nervous.\\n\\n Royce Nyland jittery! It was almost enough to make him laugh. Marriage wasn\u0027t a new experience to him. He\u0027d been through it all before. If anything was different it was the fact he and Catherine had yet to make love.\\n\\n Sandy had been sleeping with him for months before they\u0027d seriously discussed getting married. Royce wished to hell he\u0027d made love to Catherine before now. It might have eased the knot twisting his gut.\\n\\n No it wouldn\u0027t, he amended promptly. When it came right down to it, he was glad they\u0027d waited. It hadn\u0027t been easy, even with Kelly wagging her finger under their noses at every opportunity.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t need his daughter reminding him to be good, or anyone else for that matter. The Navy had seen to it all on its own. He\u0027d followed the law book, with only a few minor infractions. He\u0027d made the best of a sticky situation. But, by heaven, Catherine was his wife now, and he was ready to attempt a new world\u0027s record for lovemaking!\\n\\n A warm sensation softened his heart. He was doing everything right this time. Right by Catherine. Right by himself. Right by the Navy. There was a gratifying sort of comfort knowing that.\\n\\n \"Are you hungry?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"A little.\" Royce swore she sounded as on edge as he did, which pleased him. At least he wasn\u0027t the only one experiencing qualms.\\n\\n \"Do you want to order something from room service?\" He found a menu by the phone and scanned the list of entrees. Nothing sounded particularly appetizing, but if Catherine was interested, he\u0027d order something for her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d be willing to eat something,\" she said lightly, but Royce wasn\u0027t fooled. Dinner was a delay tactic for them both. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-woman-navy-4/page-26.html","bookId":1959,"book":{"id":1959,"title":"Navy Woman (Navy #4)","description":"Storyline: Navy Woman (Navy Series #4) \\n Despite the strictly taboo laws of naval fraternizing, navy attorney Catherine Fredrickson and her new boss, Royce Nyland, find themselves strongly attracted.
