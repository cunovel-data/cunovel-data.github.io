{"id":2613,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"7:1 [hgb] 大 利 乌 王 第 四 年 九 月 ， 就 是 基 斯 流 月 初 四 日 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 撒 迦 利 亚 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu; \n [bbe] And it came about in the fourth year of King Darius, that the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month Chislev. \n 7:2 [hgb] 那 时 伯 特 利 人 已 经 打 发 沙 利 色 和 利 坚 米 勒 ， 并 跟 从 他 们 的 人 ， 去 恳 求 耶 和 华 的 恩 ， \n [kjv] When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, \n [bbe] Now they of Beth-el had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech to make a request for grace from the Lord, \n 7:3 [hgb] 并 问 万 军 之 耶 和 华 殿 中 的 祭 司 ， 和 先 知 说 ， 我 历 年 以 来 ， 在 五 月 间 哭 泣 斋 戒 ， 现 在 还 当 这 样 行 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? \n [bbe] And to say to the priests of the house of the Lord of armies and to the prophets, Am I to go on weeping in the fifth month, separating myself as I have done in past years? \n 7:4 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 的 话 就 临 到 我 说 ， \n [kjv] Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, \n [bbe] Then the word of the Lord of armies came to me, saying \n 7:5 [hgb] 你 要 宣 告 国 内 的 众 民 ， 和 祭 司 ， 说 ， 你 们 这 七 十 年 在 五 月 ， 七 月 禁 食 悲 哀 ， 岂 是 丝 毫 向 我 禁 食 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me? \n [bbe] Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, When you went without food and gave yourselves to grief in the fifth and the seventh months for these seventy years, did you ever do it because of me? \n 7:6 [hgb] 你 们 吃 喝 ， 不 是 为 自 己 吃 ， 为 自 己 喝 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? \n [bbe] And when you are feasting and drinking, are you not doing it only for yourselves? \n 7:7 [hgb] 当 耶 路 撒 冷 和 四 围 的 城 邑 有 居 民 ， 正 兴 盛 ， 南 地 高 原 有 人 居 住 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 借 从 前 的 先 知 所 宣 告 的 话 ， 你 们 不 当 听 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain? \n [bbe] Are not these the words which the Lord said to you by the earlier prophets, when Jerusalem was full of people and wealth, and the towns round about her and the South and the Lowland were peopled? \n 7:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 又 临 到 撒 迦 利 亚 说 ， \n [kjv] And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying, \n [bbe] And the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, saying, \n 7:9 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 曾 对 你 们 的 列 祖 如 此 说 ， 要 按 至 理 判 断 ， 各 人 以 慈 爱 怜 悯 弟 兄 。 \n [kjv] Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: \n [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: Let your judging be upright and done in good faith, let every man have mercy and pity for his brother: \n 7:10 [hgb] 不 可 欺 压 寡 妇 ， 孤 儿 ， 寄 居 的 ， 和 贫 穷 人 。 谁 都 不 可 心 里 谋 害 弟 兄 。 \n [kjv] And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. \n [bbe] Do not be hard on the widow, or the child without a father, on the man from a strange country, or on the poor; let there be no evil thought in your heart against your brother. \n 7:11 [hgb] 他 们 却 不 肯 听 从 ， 扭 转 肩 头 ， 塞 耳 不 听 。 \n [kjv] But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. \n [bbe] But they would not give attention, turning their backs and stopping their ears from hearing; \n 7:12 [hgb] 使 心 硬 如 金 钢 石 ， 不 听 律 法 ， 和 万 军 之 耶 和 华 用 灵 借 从 前 的 先 知 所 说 的 话 。 故 此 ， 万 军 之 耶 和 华 大 发 烈 怒 。 \n [kjv] Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts. \n [bbe] And they made their hearts like the hardest stone, so that they might not give ear to the law and the words which the Lord of armies had said by the earlier prophets: and there came great wrath from the Lord of armies. \n 7:13 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 曾 呼 唤 他 们 ， 他 们 不 听 。 将 来 他 们 呼 求 我 ， 我 也 不 听 。 \n [kjv] Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts: \n [bbe] And it came about that as they would not give ear to his voice, so I would not give ear to their voice, says the Lord of armies: \n 7:14 [hgb] 我 必 以 旋 风 吹 散 他 们 到 素 不 认 识 的 万 国 中 。 这 样 ， 他 们 的 地 就 荒 凉 ， 甚 至 无 人 来 往 经 过 。 因 为 他 们 使 美 好 之 地 荒 凉 了 。 \n [kjv] But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate. \n [bbe] But with a storm-wind I sent them in flight among all the nations of whom they had no knowledge. So the land was waste after them, so that no man went through or came back: for they had made waste the desired land. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150/2084.html","bookId":106,"book":{"id":106,"title":"撒迦利亚 Zechariah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 利 乌 王 第 二 年 八 月 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 易 多 的 孙 子 ， 比 利 家 的 儿 子 ， 先 知 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 说 ， [kjv] In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zecharia...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
