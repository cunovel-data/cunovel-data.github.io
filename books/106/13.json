Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. \n [bbe] And if anyone says to him, What are these wounds between your hands? then he will say, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. \n 13:7 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 ， 刀 剑 哪 ， 应 当 兴 起 ， 攻 击 我 的 牧 人 ， 和 我 的 同 伴 。 击 打 牧 人 ， 羊 就 分 散 ， 我 必 反 手 加 在 微 小 者 的 身 上 。 \n [kjv] Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones. \n [bbe] Awake! O sword, against the keeper of my flock, and against him who is with me, says the Lord of armies: put to death the keeper of the sheep, and the sheep will go in flight: and my hand will be turned against the little ones. \n 13:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 这 全 地 的 人 ， 三 分 之 二 ， 必 剪 除 而 死 ， 三 分 之 一 ， 仍 必 存 留 。 \n [kjv] And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein. \n [bbe] And it will come about that in all the land, says the Lord, two parts of it will be cut off and come to an end; but the third will be still living there. \n 13:9 [hgb] 我 要 使 这 三 分 之 一 经 火 ， 熬 炼 他 们 ， 如 熬 炼 银 子 ， 试 炼 他 们 ， 如 试 炼 金 子 。 他 们 必 求 告 我 的 名 ， 我 必 应 允 他 们 。 我 要 说 ， 这 是 我 的 子 民 。 他 们 也 要 说 ， 耶 和 华 是 我 们 的 神 。 \n [kjv] And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God. \n [bbe] And I will make the third part go through the fire, cleaning them as silver is made clean, and testing them as gold is tested: and they will make their prayer to me and I will give them an answer: I will say, It is my people; and they will say, The Lord is my God. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150/2090.html","bookId":106,"book":{"id":106,"title":"撒迦利亚 Zechariah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 利 乌 王 第 二 年 八 月 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 易 多 的 孙 子 ， 比 利 家 的 儿 子 ， 先 知 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 说 ， [kjv] In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zecharia...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
