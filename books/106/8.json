{"id":2614,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 我 说 ， [kjv] Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, [bbe] And the word of the Lord of armies came to me, saying, 8:2 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 为 锡 安 心 里 极 其 火 热 。 我 为 她 火 热 ， 向 她 的 仇 敌 发 烈 怒 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. [bbe] These are the words of the Lord of armies: I am angry about the fate of Zion, I am angry about her with great wrath. 8:3 [hgb] 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 现 在 回 到 锡 安 ， 要 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 中 。 耶 路 撒 冷 必 称 为 诚 实 的 城 ， 万 军 之 耶 和 华 的 山 必 称 为 圣 山 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain. [bbe] This is what the Lord has said: I have come back to Zion, and will make my living-place in Jerusalem: and Jerusalem will be named The town of good faith; and the mountain of the Lord of armies The holy mountain. 8:4 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 将 来 必 有 年 老 的 男 女 ， 坐 在 耶 路 撒 冷 街 上 。 因 为 年 纪 老 迈 就 手 拿 拐 杖 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age. [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: There will again be old men and old women seated in the open spaces of Jerusalem, every man with his stick in his hand because he is so old. 8:5 [hgb] 城 中 街 上 必 满 有 男 孩 女 孩 玩 耍 。 [kjv] And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. [bbe] And the open spaces of the town will be full of boys and girls playing in its open spaces. 8:6 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 到 那 日 ， 这 事 在 余 剩 的 民 眼 中 看 为 希 奇 ， 在 我 眼 中 也 看 为 希 奇 吗 ？ 这 是 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts. [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: If this is a wonder to the rest of this people, is it a wonder to me? says the Lord of armies. 8:7 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 要 从 东 方 从 西 方 救 回 我 的 民 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country; [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: See, I will be the saviour of my people from the east country, and from the west country; 8:8 [hgb] 我 要 领 他 们 来 ， 使 他 们 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 中 。 他 们 要 作 我 的 子 民 ， 我 要 作 他 们 的 神 ， 都 凭 诚 实 和 公 义 。 [kjv] And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness. [bbe] And I will make them come and be living in Jerusalem and they will be to me a people and I will be to them a God, in good faith and in righteousness. 8:9 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 当 建 造 万 军 之 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 立 根 基 之 日 的 先 知 所 说 的 话 ， 现 在 你 们 听 见 ， 应 当 手 里 强 壮 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: Let your hands be strong, you who are now hearing these words from the mouths of the prophets, that is to say, in the days when the base of the house of the Lord of armies has been put in place for the building of the house, that is the Temple. 8:10 [hgb] 那 日 以 先 ， 人 得 不 着 雇 价 ， 牲 畜 也 是 如 此 。 且 因 敌 人 的 缘 故 ， 出 入 之 人 ， 不 得 平 安 。 乃 因 我 使 众 人 互 相 攻 击 。 [kjv] For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour. [bbe] For before those days there was no payment for a man\u0027s work, or for the use of a beast, and there was no peace for him who went out or him who came in, because of the attacker: for I had every man turned against his neighbour. 8:11 [hgb] 但 如 今 ， 我 待 这 余 剩 的 民 必 不 像 从 前 。 这 是 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts. [bbe] But now I will not be to the rest of this people as I was in the past, says the Lord of armies. 8:12 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 必 平 安 撒 种 。 葡 萄 树 必 结 果 子 ， 地 土 必 有 出 产 ， 天 也 必 降 甘 露 。 我 要 使 这 余 剩 的 民 ， 享 受 这 一 切 的 福 。 [kjv] For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. [bbe] For I will let the seed of peace be planted; the vine will give her fruit and the land will give her increase and the heavens will give their dew; and I will give to the rest of this people all these things for their heritage. 8:13 [hgb] 犹 大 家 和 以 色 列 家 阿 ， 你 们 从 前 在 列 国 中 ， 怎 样 成 为 可 咒 诅 的 ， 照 样 ， 我 要 拯 救 你 们 ， 使 人 称 你 们 为 有 福 的 （ 或 作 使 你 们 叫 人 得 福 ） 。 你 们 不 要 惧 怕 ， 手 要 强 壮 。 [kjv] And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong. [bbe] And it will come about that, as you were a curse among the nations, O children of Judah and children of Israel, so I will give you salvation and you will be a blessing: have no fear and let your hands be strong. 8:14 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 们 列 祖 惹 我 发 怒 的 时 候 ， 我 怎 样 定 意 降 祸 ， 并 不 后 悔 。 [kjv] For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not: [bbe] For this is what the Lord of armies has said: As it was my purpose to do evil to you when your fathers made me angry, says the Lord of armies, and my purpose was not changed: 8:15 [hgb] 现 在 我 照 样 定 意 施 恩 与 耶 路 撒 冷 和 犹 大 家 ， 你 们 不 要 惧 怕 。 [kjv] So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. [bbe] So in these days it is again my purpose to do good to Jerusalem and to the children of Judah: have no fear. 8:16 [hgb] 你 们 所 当 行 的 是 这 样 ， 各 人 与 邻 舍 说 话 诚 实 ， 在 城 门 口 按 至 理 判 断 ， 使 人 和 睦 。 [kjv] These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates: [bbe] These are the things which you are to do: Let every man say what is true to his neighbour; and let your judging give peace in your towns. 8:17 [hgb] 谁 都 不 可 心 里 谋 害 邻 舍 ， 也 不 可 喜 爱 起 假 誓 。 因 为 这 些 事 都 为 我 所 恨 恶 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD. [bbe] Let no one have any evil thought in his heart against his neighbour; and have no love for false oaths: for all these things are hated by me, says the Lord. 8:18 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 我 说 ， [kjv] And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying, [bbe] And the word of the Lord of armies came to me, saying, 8:19 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 四 月 五 月 禁 食 的 日 子 ， 七 月 十 月 禁 食 的 日 子 ， 必 变 为 犹 大 家 欢 喜 快 乐 的 日 子 ， 和 欢 乐 的 节 期 。 所 以 你 们 要 喜 爱 诚 实 与 和 平 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: The times of going without food in the fourth month and in the fifth and the seventh and the tenth months, will be for the people of Judah times of joy and happy meetings; so be lovers of good faith and of peace. 8:20 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 将 来 必 有 列 国 的 人 ， 和 多 城 的 居 民 来 到 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: It will again come about that when peoples and those living in great towns come, 8:21 [hgb] 这 城 的 居 民 必 到 那 城 ， 说 ， 我 们 要 快 去 恳 求 耶 和 华 的 恩 ， 寻 求 万 军 之 耶 和 华 。 我 也 要 去 。 [kjv] And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also. [bbe] And the people of one town go to another and say, Let us certainly go with a request for grace from the Lord, and to give worship to the Lord of armies, then I will go with you. 8:22 [hgb] 必 有 列 邦 的 人 ， 和 强 国 的 民 ， 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 寻 求 万 军 之 耶 和 华 。 恳 求 耶 和 华 的 恩 。 [kjv] Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD. [bbe] And great peoples and strong nations will come to give worship to the Lord of armies in Jerusalem and to make requests for grace from the Lord. 8:23 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 在 那 些 日 子 ， 必 有 十 个 人 从 列 国 诸 族 中 出 来 （ 族 原 文 作 方 言 ） ， 拉 住 一 个 犹 大 人 的 衣 襟 ， 说 ， 我 们 要 与 你 们 同 去 ， 因 为 我 们 听 见 神 与 你 们 同 在 了 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you. [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: In those days, ten men from all the languages of the nations will put out their hands and take a grip of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for it has come to our ears that God is with you.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150/2085.html","bookId":106,"book":{"id":106,"title":"撒迦利亚 Zechariah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 利 乌 王 第 二 年 八 月 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 易 多 的 孙 子 ， 比 利 家 的 儿 子 ， 先 知 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 说 ， [kjv] In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zecharia...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
