{"id":2617,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"11:1 [hgb] 利 巴 嫩 哪 ， 开 开 你 的 门 ， 任 火 烧 灭 你 的 香 柏 树 。 \n [kjv] Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. \n [bbe] Let your doors be open, O Lebanon, so that fire may be burning among your cedars. \n 11:2 [hgb] 松 树 阿 ， 应 当 哀 号 ， 因 为 香 柏 树 倾 倒 ， 佳 美 的 树 毁 坏 。 巴 珊 的 橡 树 阿 ， 应 当 哀 号 ， 因 为 茂 盛 的 树 林 已 经 倒 了 。 \n [kjv] Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down. \n [bbe] Give a cry of grief, O fir-tree, for the fall of the cedar, because the great ones have been made low: give cries of grief, O you oaks of Bashan, for the strong trees of the wood have come down. \n 11:3 [hgb] 听 阿 ， 有 牧 人 哀 号 的 声 音 ， 因 他 们 荣 华 的 草 场 毁 坏 了 。 有 少 壮 狮 子 咆 哮 的 声 音 ， 因 约 旦 河 旁 的 丛 林 荒 废 了 。 \n [kjv] There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled. \n [bbe] The sound of the crying of the keepers of the flock! for their glory is made waste: the sound of the loud crying of the young lions! for the pride of Jordan is made waste. \n 11:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 我 的 神 如 此 说 ， 你 撒 迦 利 亚 要 牧 养 这 将 宰 的 群 羊 。 \n [kjv] Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; \n [bbe] This is what the Lord my God has said: Take care of the flock of death; \n 11:5 [hgb] 买 他 们 的 宰 了 他 们 ， 以 自 己 为 无 罪 。 卖 他 们 的 说 ， 耶 和 华 是 应 当 称 颂 的 ， 因 我 成 为 富 足 。 牧 养 他 们 的 并 不 怜 恤 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not. \n [bbe] Whose owners put them to death and have no sense of sin; and those who get a price for them say, May the Lord be praised for I have much wealth: and the keepers of the flock have no pity for them. \n 11:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 不 再 怜 恤 这 地 的 居 民 。 必 将 这 民 交 给 各 人 的 邻 舍 ， 和 他 们 王 的 手 中 。 他 们 必 毁 灭 这 地 ， 我 也 不 救 这 民 脱 离 他 们 的 手 。 \n [kjv] For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour\u0027s hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them. \n [bbe] For I will have no more pity for the people of the land, says the Lord; but I will give up everyone into his neighbour\u0027s hand and into the hand of his king: and they will make the land waste, and I will not keep them safe from their hands. \n 11:7 [hgb] 于 是 ， 我 牧 养 这 将 宰 的 群 羊 ， 就 是 群 中 最 困 苦 的 羊 。 我 拿 着 两 根 杖 。 一 根 我 称 为 荣 美 ， 一 根 我 称 为 联 索 。 这 样 ， 我 牧 养 了 群 羊 。 \n [kjv] And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. \n [bbe] So I took care of the flock of death, for those who made profit out of the flock; and I took for myself two rods, naming one Beautiful, and the other Bands; and I took care of the flock. \n 11:8 [hgb] 一 月 之 内 ， 我 除 灭 三 个 牧 人 。 因 为 我 的 心 厌 烦 他 们 ， 他 们 的 心 也 憎 嫌 我 。 \n [kjv] Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. \n [bbe] And in one month I put an end to the three keepers of the flock; for my soul was tired of them, and their souls were disgusted with me. \n 11:9 [hgb] 我 就 说 ， 我 不 牧 养 你 们 。 要 死 的 ， 由 他 死 。 要 丧 亡 的 ， 由 他 丧 亡 。 余 剩 的 ， 由 他 们 彼 此 相 食 。 \n [kjv] Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. \n [bbe] And I said, I will not take care of you: If death comes to any, let death be its fate; if any is cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest take one another\u0027s flesh for food. \n 11:10 [hgb] 我 折 断 那 称 为 荣 美 的 杖 ， 表 明 我 废 弃 与 万 民 所 立 的 约 。 \n [kjv] And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. \n [bbe] And I took my rod Beautiful, cutting it in two, so that the Lord\u0027s agreement, which he had made with all the peoples, might be broken. \n 11:11 [hgb] 当 日 就 废 弃 了 。 这 样 ， 那 些 仰 望 我 的 困 苦 羊 ， 就 知 道 所 说 的 是 耶 和 华 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD. \n [bbe] And it was broken on that day: and the sheep-traders, who were watching me, were certain that it was the word of the Lord. \n 11:12 [hgb] 我 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 若 以 为 美 ， 就 给 我 工 价 ， 不 然 ， 就 罢 了 。 于 是 他 们 给 了 三 十 块 钱 ， 作 为 我 的 工 价 。 \n [kjv] And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. \n [bbe] And I said to them, If it seems good to you, give me my payment; and if not, do not give it. So they gave me my payment by weight, thirty shekels of silver. \n 11:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 吩 咐 我 说 ， 要 把 众 人 所 估 定 美 好 的 价 值 ， 丢 给 窑 户 。 我 便 将 这 三 十 块 钱 ， 在 耶 和 华 的 殿 中 丢 给 窑 户 了 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to me, Put it into the store-house, the price at which I was valued by them. And I took the thirty shekels of silver and put them into the store-house in the house of the Lord. \n 11:14 [hgb] 我 又 折 断 称 为 联 索 的 那 根 杖 ， 表 明 我 废 弃 犹 大 与 以 色 列 弟 兄 的 情 谊 。 \n [kjv] Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. \n [bbe] Then I took my other rod, the one named Bands, cutting it in two, so that the relation of brothers between Judah and Israel might be broken. \n 11:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 又 吩 咐 我 说 ， 你 再 取 愚 昧 人 所 用 的 器 具 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to me, Take again the instruments of a foolish keeper of sheep. \n 11:16 [hgb] 因 我 要 在 这 地 兴 起 一 个 牧 人 。 他 不 看 顾 丧 亡 的 ， 不 寻 找 分 散 的 ， 不 医 治 受 伤 的 ， 也 不 牧 养 强 壮 的 。 却 要 吃 肥 羊 的 肉 ， 撕 裂 它 的 蹄 子 。 \n [kjv] For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. \n [bbe] For see, I will put a sheep-keeper over the land, who will have no care for that which is cut off, and will not go in search of the wanderers, or make well what is broken, and he will not give food to that which is ill, but he will take for his food the flesh of the fat, and let their feet be broken. \n 11:17 [hgb] 无 用 的 牧 人 丢 弃 羊 群 有 祸 了 。 刀 必 临 到 他 的 膀 臂 ， 和 右 眼 上 。 他 的 膀 臂 必 全 然 枯 干 ， 他 的 右 眼 也 必 昏 暗 失 明 。 \n [kjv] Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. \n [bbe] A curse on the foolish keeper who goes away from the flock! the sword will be on his arm and on his right eye: his arm will become quite dry and his eye will be made completely dark. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150/2088.html","bookId":106,"book":{"id":106,"title":"撒迦利亚 Zechariah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 利 乌 王 第 二 年 八 月 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 易 多 的 孙 子 ， 比 利 家 的 儿 子 ， 先 知 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 说 ， [kjv] In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zecharia...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
