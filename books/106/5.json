And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. \n [bbe] And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, A roll going through the air; it is twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. \n 5:3 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 这 是 发 出 行 在 遍 地 上 的 咒 诅 。 凡 偷 窃 的 必 按 卷 上 这 面 的 话 除 灭 。 凡 起 假 誓 的 必 按 卷 上 那 面 的 话 除 灭 。 \n [kjv] Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it. \n [bbe] Then he said to me, This is the curse which goes out over the face of all the land: for long enough has every thief gone without punishment, and long enough has every taker of false oaths gone without punishment. \n 5:4 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 必 使 这 书 卷 出 去 ， 进 入 偷 窃 人 的 家 ， 和 指 我 名 起 假 誓 人 的 家 ， 必 常 在 他 家 里 ， 连 房 屋 带 木 石 都 毁 灭 了 。 \n [kjv] I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof. \n [bbe] And I will send it out, says the Lord of armies, and it will go into the house of the thief and into the house of him who takes a false oath by my name: and it will be in his house, causing its complete destruction, with its woodwork and its stones. \n 5:5 [hgb] 与 我 说 话 的 天 使 出 来 ， 对 我 说 ， 你 要 举 目 观 看 ， 见 所 出 来 的 是 什 么 ？ \n [kjv] Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth. \n [bbe] And the angel who was talking to me went out and said to me, Let your eyes be lifted up now, and see the ephah which is going out. \n 5:6 [hgb] 我 说 ， 这 是 什 么 呢 ？ 他 说 ， 这 出 来 的 是 量 器 。 他 又 说 ， 这 是 恶 人 ， 在 遍 地 的 形 状 。 \n [kjv] And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth. \n [bbe] And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah which is going out. And he said further, This is their evil-doing in all the land. \n 5:7 [hgb] （ 我 见 有 一 片 圆 铅 被 举 起 来 ） 这 坐 在 量 器 中 的 是 个 妇 人 。 \n [kjv] And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. \n [bbe] And I saw a round cover of lead lifted up; and a woman was seated in the middle of the ephah. \n 5:8 [hgb] 天 使 说 ， 这 是 罪 恶 。 他 就 把 妇 人 扔 在 量 器 中 ， 将 那 片 圆 铅 扔 在 量 器 的 口 上 。 \n [kjv] And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. \n [bbe] And he said, This is Sin; and pushing her down into the ephah, he put the weight of lead on the mouth of it. \n 5:9 [hgb] 我 又 举 目 观 看 ， 见 有 两 个 妇 人 出 来 ， 在 她 们 翅 膀 中 有 风 ， 飞 得 甚 快 。 翅 膀 如 同 鹳 鸟 的 翅 膀 。 她 们 将 量 器 抬 起 来 ， 悬 在 天 地 中 间 。 \n [kjv] Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. \n [bbe] And lifting up my eyes I saw two women coming out, and the wind was in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they took the ephah, lifting it up between earth and heaven. \n 5:10 [hgb] 我 问 与 我 说 话 的 天 使 说 ， 她 们 要 将 量 器 抬 到 哪 里 去 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? \n [bbe] And I said to the angel who was talking to me, Where are they taking the ephah? \n 5:11 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 要 往 示 拿 地 去 ， 为 它 盖 造 房 屋 。 等 房 屋 齐 备 ， 就 把 它 安 置 在 自 己 的 地 方 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base. \n [bbe] And he said to me, To make a house for her in the land of Shinar: and they will make a place ready, and put her there in the place which is hers. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150/2082.html","bookId":106,"book":{"id":106,"title":"撒迦利亚 Zechariah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 利 乌 王 第 二 年 八 月 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 易 多 的 孙 子 ， 比 利 家 的 儿 子 ， 先 知 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 说 ， [kjv] In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zecharia...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
