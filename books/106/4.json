And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof: \n [bbe] And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see a light-support, made all of gold, with its cup on the top of it and seven lights on it; and there are seven pipes to every one of the lights which are on the top of it; \n 4:3 [hgb] 旁 边 有 两 棵 橄 榄 树 ， 一 棵 在 灯 盏 的 右 边 ， 一 棵 在 灯 盏 的 左 边 。 \n [kjv] And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. \n [bbe] And two olive-trees by it, one on the right side of the cup and one on the left. \n 4:4 [hgb] 我 问 与 我 说 话 的 天 使 说 ， 主 阿 ， 这 是 什 么 意 思 。 \n [kjv] So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord? \n [bbe] And I made answer and said to the angel who was talking to me, What are these, my lord? \n 4:5 [hgb] 与 我 说 话 的 天 使 回 答 我 说 ， 你 不 知 道 这 是 什 么 意 思 吗 ？ 我 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 不 知 道 。 \n [kjv] Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. \n [bbe] Then the angel who was talking to me, answering me, said, Have you no knowledge of what these are? And I said, No, my lord. \n 4:6 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 这 是 耶 和 华 指 示 所 罗 巴 伯 的 。 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 ， 不 是 倚 靠 势 力 ， 不 是 倚 靠 才 能 ， 乃 是 倚 靠 我 的 灵 ， 方 能 成 事 。 \n [kjv] Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. \n [bbe] This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by force or by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord of armies. \n 4:7 [hgb] 大 山 哪 ， 你 算 什 么 呢 ？ 在 所 罗 巴 伯 面 前 ， 你 必 成 为 平 地 。 他 必 搬 出 一 块 石 头 ， 安 在 殿 顶 上 。 人 且 大 声 欢 呼 ， 说 ， 愿 恩 惠 恩 惠 归 与 这 殿 （ 殿 或 作 石 ） 。 \n [kjv] Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it. \n [bbe] Who are you, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel you will become level: and he will let all see the headstone, with cries of Grace, grace, to it. \n 4:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 又 临 到 我 说 ， \n [kjv] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, \n [bbe] Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, \n 4:9 [hgb] 所 罗 巴 伯 的 手 ， 立 了 这 殿 的 根 基 。 他 的 手 也 必 完 成 这 工 。 你 就 知 道 万 军 之 耶 和 华 差 遣 我 到 你 们 这 里 来 了 。 \n [kjv] The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. \n [bbe] The hands of Zerubbabel have put the base of this house in place, and his hands will make it complete; and it will be clear to you that the Lord of armies has sent me to you. \n 4:10 [hgb] 谁 藐 视 这 日 的 事 为 小 呢 ？ 这 七 眼 乃 是 耶 和 华 的 眼 睛 ， 遍 察 全 地 ， 见 所 罗 巴 伯 手 拿 线 铊 就 欢 喜 。 \n [kjv] For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth. \n [bbe] For who has had a poor opinion of the day of small things? for they will be glad when they see the weighted measuring-line in the hand of Zerubbabel. Then he said in answer to me, These seven lights are the eyes of the Lord which go quickly up and down through all the earth. \n 4:11 [hgb] 我 又 问 天 使 说 ， 这 灯 台 左 右 的 两 棵 橄 榄 树 ， 是 什 么 意 思 。 \n [kjv] Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof? \n [bbe] And I made answer and said to him, What are these two olive-trees on the right side of the light-support and on the left? \n 4:12 [hgb] 我 二 次 问 他 说 ， 这 两 根 橄 榄 枝 ， 在 两 个 流 出 金 色 油 的 金 嘴 旁 边 ， 是 什 么 意 思 。 \n [kjv] And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? \n [bbe] And answering a second time, I said to him, What are these two olive branches, through whose gold pipes the oil is drained out? \n 4:13 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 你 不 知 道 这 是 什 么 意 思 吗 ？ 我 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 不 知 道 。 \n [kjv] And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. \n [bbe] And he said in answer to me, Have you no knowledge what these are? And I said, No, my lord. \n 4:14 [hgb] 他 说 ， 这 是 两 个 受 膏 者 ， 站 在 普 天 下 主 的 旁 边 。 \n [kjv] Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth. \n [bbe] And he said, These are the two sons of oil, whose place is by the Lord of all the earth. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150/2081.html","bookId":106,"book":{"id":106,"title":"撒迦利亚 Zechariah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 利 乌 王 第 二 年 八 月 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 易 多 的 孙 子 ， 比 利 家 的 儿 子 ， 先 知 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 说 ， [kjv] In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zecharia...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/150","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
