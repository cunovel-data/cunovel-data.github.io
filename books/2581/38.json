There was a table made from boards stretched across stacks of heavy encyclopedias, and the table bent under the weight of weapons. Handguns and boxes of bullets, knives and clubs, spears and axes. Enough weapons to start—and win—a war. Benny realized Lilah was doing exactly that—fighting a war. He walked over to the table, aware the Lilah was watching him, and saw that a how-to manual for making bullet reloads was open and looked well-thumbed. There were coffee cans filled with lead pellets and gunpowder, and a bullet mold with castings for various calibers. Several men in town had similar setups.\\n\\n “This is amazing,” he said.\\n\\n She shrugged. It was commonplace to her. It was her day-to-day life.\\n\\n Lilah folded some blankets and set them on the floor, then indicated that they could sit down while she started a fire in a small stone cooking pit. Benny noticed that the smoke funneled upward instead of filling the cave, and he bent forward to see that there was a hole in the ceiling. No daylight showed through, so he figured it didn’t rise straight up, but instead filtered out through various fissures in the rock. He thought that Tom would approve.\\n\\n Benny watched Lilah as she busied herself with what probably passed for her daily routine. Her first concern was security, and she checked the hang of the drapes to prevent any trace of light from showing through. Even a pinpoint of firelight would be visible for miles in the absolute darkness of these mountains at night. Then Lilah strung two lines across the entrance. The first was a length of twine on which dozens of empty tin cans and pieces of broken metal were strung. When it was in place, it lay against the drapes. If anyone moved the cloth, the metal would kick up a jangling din, loud enough to wake her. The second line was a length of silver wire she positioned at mid-shin level. It was virtually invisible in the gloom, but once someone passed the drapes, they would trip over it. Between the noise and this delaying trick, whoever broke in would not be sneaking up on a sleeping girl, but would be sprawled on the ground while a practiced killer hunted them in the dark.\\n\\n “Did you ever have to use that trip wire?” he asked. He and Nix and their friends had learned all about simple booby traps in the Scouts. They were great for slowing down a zombie attack.\\n\\n Lilah tested the tension on the trip wire, plucking it like a guitar string, so that it hummed. “Once,” she said. “It worked.”\\n\\n “Zom or human?” asked Nix.\\n\\n Lilah shrugged. “What does it matter?”\\n\\n Once the entrance was rigged, she unbuckled her gun belt and placed it next to the pallet she used as a bed. She put the spear into an old umbrella stand in which there were various clubs, baseball bats, hockey sticks, and a long-handled axe.\\n\\n “Lilah,” said Nix. “This place—all these things—it’s incredible. You brought all of this here by yourself?”\\n\\n Lilah poured water into a cooking pot and began adding bits of meat and vegetables. “By myself. Who else?”\\n\\n “How many of these books have you read?”\\n\\n “All.” She smiled for the first time since they’d started walking. She leaned over and began stirring the mixture in the pot. “I … read, um, better than talk. Sorry.”\\n\\n “Sorry?” said Benny enthusiastically. “Lilah, you’re amazing! Isn’t she amazing, Nix?”\\n\\n Benny, caught up in the moment, turned to Nix, but her expression was a few hundred degrees colder than his. Benny’s common sense took a giant step back for an emergency re-evaluation of everything that had happened in the last few seconds. Lilah, lit by the soft glow of the cook fire, was bending over and smiling. The inadequate rags of her shirt were doing even less of their job. Benny, who, to his credit, hadn’t even been aware of all this, was suddenly very aware—and aware of the fact that Nix was watching both of them. The common sense part of him slapped his forehead and prayed for an earthquake or a timely invasion by a horde of zoms. Benny tried to salvage the moment by stretching his last question into a longer one. “… to have read so many books.”\\n\\n As lame attempts go, this one was barely able to limp.\\n\\n The grin he gave Nix was intended to be earnest, scholarly, and totally oblivious to the miles of cleavage Lilah was showing. Nix’s smile was chilly enough to kill houseplants.\\n\\n And Chong fries Morgie for being thick, Benny thought, feeling the edges of his smile begin to crack.\\n\\n To Lilah, Nix said, “George taught you to read?”\\n\\n Lilah, who was unpracticed enough with people to misread the moment, nodded and sat back. “Yes. We had to read. All the time. ‘Knowledge is power,’” she recited in a voice that was clearly an attempt to imitate George’s.\\n\\n They nodded. Benny took the opportunity to ask her some questions. “Lilah, have you been alone all this time? I mean … since Gameland?”\\n\\n She nodded. “Alone.”\\n\\n “How did you survive?” asked Nix.\\n\\n Lilah turned cold eyes on her. “What I see,” she said, “I kill.”\\n\\n “God,” said Nix.\\n\\n Benny said, “What about the way-station monks? Do they help you at all?”\\n\\n “Monks … We don’t talk. They have their, um, things. I have mine.”\\n\\n “Tom said he saw you twice.”\\n\\n “Tom,” she said, and shook her head.\\n\\n “He looked like me. But he was older. Darker hair, darker skin. Tall. Carried a sword.”\\n\\n The Lost Girl brightened and smiled in a way that Benny thought it showed she not only knew who Tom was but maybe betrayed something more than simple recognition.\\n\\n “Sword man,” Lilah said. “Very, um, pretty.” She looked at Nix for approval. “Pretty?”\\n\\n “Handsome,” Nix said. “Hot.”\\n\\n Lilah liked that word. “Hot.” She turned to Benny. “But … dead?”\\n\\n He nodded. “The Hammer shot him, and he fell into a bunch of zoms.”\\n\\n Her smiled vanished. “Then he’s a walker.”\\n\\n Benny couldn’t bear to think about that and changed the subject. “Lilah, Tom said that you could tell people where the new Gameland is.”\\n\\n “What people?”\\n\\n “People in our town. In Mountainside.”\\n\\n She shrugged. “Why?”\\n\\n “I think he was hoping to have Charlie arrested. Do you understand what that means? Arrested?”\\n\\n “Read about. Old world stuff. Not our world.”\\n\\n “No,” said Nix bitterly. She touched Lilah’s arm. “Tell us, though. What happened after they took you and Annie away from George?”\\n\\n “George,” she said in a small, sad voice that was an echo of the child she had once been and would never be again. She sorted through her conflicted emotions and jumbled thoughts. “They hit George. Killed him, I thought. But … not?”\\n\\n “No,” said Benny. “He was hurt, but he lived. As soon as he woke up, he started looking for you and your sister. He met Tom, and they looked together. They couldn’t find you. I guess George didn’t know where to look. How far is Gameland from here?”\\n\\n “Far. Three days fast walk. Two mountains from here,” said Lilah. “Have to know how to, um … find it. Hard to find.”\\n\\n “George never found it. All he heard were rumors of what goes on there. It tore him up.”\\n\\n It took Lilah a second to understand that last comment, then she nodded. “George loved us. Loved him. He is … dead?”\\n\\n “I think so. A monk told Tom that George hung himself.”\\n\\n Lilah barked out a harsh laugh and shook her head. “No,” she said decisively.\\n\\n “Tom didn’t believe it, either.”\\n\\n They sat for a minute in silence.\\n\\n “He was murdered,” Nix said eventually. “Do think it was Charlie?”\\n\\n “Or one of his creeps,” said Benny. Lilah’s lip curled, but she said nothing.\\n\\n “Lilah … tell us about Annie.”\\n\\n “Annie.” Lilah’s eyes were as hard as knife steel, but they glistened wetly. “They took us. Lots of girls at Gameland. Boys too. They … make us fight.” She loaded that last word with enough venom to kill a hundred men.\\n\\n “Did they make you fight?” Nix asked, and Benny winced, not wanting to hear the answer.\\n\\n But Lilah shook her head. “Tried. Many times they tried. Fought them instead. Bit. Kicked. Thumbs to eyes. George taught me. Taught Annie.” She made a fist so tight, her knuckles creaked, and the lights in her eyes looked both dangerous and a little crazy. “Be tough, George said. Be tough and live. George always said that.”\\n\\n “George was right,” Benny said. “I wish I’d met him. He sounds like a pretty great guy.”\\n\\n Lilah gave Benny a slow up-and-down appraisal, perhaps re-evaluating him. Or maybe seeing him for the first time and getting who he was. She nodded, although Benny wasn’t sure if that was an agreement with what he’d said or a confirmation of some unspoken thought.\\n\\n “So you fought?” Nix said, perhaps a little more sharply than was absolutely necessary.\\n\\n Lilah’s eyes lingered on Benny as she said, “Yes.”\\n\\n “What did they do?” Nix asked, and this time there was more compassion in her voice.\\n\\n “They beat me.” Lilah shrugged as if that was nothing, as if measured against all that she had endured, it was a small thing. Nix paled and Benny shivered. “Beat me a lot. No food.”\\n\\n Nix cursed.\\n\\n Lilah gave another shrug. “Made me tougher. Made me mad. Mad enough.”\\n\\n “And Annie?”\\n\\n “She … ran.”\\n\\n They looked at her and saw a tear break from the corner of one hazel eye and roll down her tanned cheek. It glistened like a diamond in the lantern light.\\n\\n “Ran?”\\n\\n “Fought and ran. Stormy night, lots of rain. Annie ran, the ugly man chased her. Hammer. He chased. Annie tripped. Slipped on mud. She fell. Badly. Hit her head on a stone.”\\n\\n “No …”\\n\\n “I couldn’t do … anything.” Lilah shook her head in denial of the memory. “They left her there. Like trash out in the rain. Like she was nothing. I was already out of there, escaped two days before, but came back. Sneaky, quiet. To get Annie. But … when I found her, Annie was gone. Already gone. Then she … came back.”\\n\\n “Oh God, no …”\\n\\n “Tried to bite.”\\n\\n More tears fell from Lilah’s eyes. It was all that Lilah would say on the subject. Nix asked her what she’d done with her sister, but Lilah just shook her head. Benny matched this against what Tom had told him, of the man Lilah has been trying to kill over and over again. The Motor City Hammer. All these long, frustrating years, Lilah had been killing the image of the Hammer in the hopes that one day she’d get him within range to take revenge for what had been done to her and her little sister.\\n\\n “I’m sorry,” said Nix.\\n\\n Lilah turned to her, eyes cold, voice frosty. “Sorry? Does that bring Annie back?”\\n\\n “Well, no, but I—”\\n\\n “Save words like ‘sorry.’ Save for the dead. Living don’t need them.”\\n\\n She snatched up her spoon and forcefully stirred the stew, slopping some bits into the fire. Benny reached out and took Nix’s hand.\\n\\n “How can the world be this cruel?” Nix asked quietly.\\n\\n There was no chance that Benny could answer that question, but there was something about the warmth and reality of the hand he held in his that made an argument that cruelty wasn’t the only force at work in their world.\\n\\n Nix said, “Lilah, will you come back to town with us?”\\n\\n The Lost Girl looked up. “Why?”\\n\\n “So you’ll be safe,” said Nix.\\n\\n “Safe now.”\\n\\n “It’s safer in town,” Nix said, but Lilah laughed.\\n\\n “Charlie and the Hammer killed your mother in your town.” She pointed to Benny. “Killed his brother out here. Nowhere is safe.”\\n\\n Before Benny or Nix could reply to that, Lilah added, “Out here—I kill. Walkers, bad men. I kill and I live. I’m safe here.”\\n\\n That put an end to the conversation until after the stew was cooked. She dished out food, and Benny had to use real effort to maintain a straight face, because the one thing this wild girl could not do was cook. The stew tasted like hot sewage. He noticed that Nix was pretending to enjoy it while not actually eating much.\\n\\n “Lilah,” Benny said, “Charlie Pink-eye’s camp is up here, right? On the other side of the mountain?”\\n\\n Lilah nodded.\\n\\n “Nix, you heard him,” Benny said. “He has kids up there, right?”\\n\\n “Yes,” Nix said with a shudder. “They’re taking them to Gameland. It’s where they were going to take me.”\\n\\n “Gameland,” Lilah said, and she bared her teeth like a hunting cat. Her fist knotted around her fork until the tendons in her hand were as taut as fiddle strings. “Annie.”\\n\\n “Gameland,” repeated Nix in a sick, flat voice.\\n\\n “Charlie and the Hammer have destroyed all of our families. They’re worse than any zom out here in the Ruin. They’re worse than a world of zoms. At least the zoms don’t know that what they’re doing is wrong. Charlie and the Hammer do. They’re evil.”\\n\\n “Evil,” Lilah said, and the Nix echoed the word.\\n\\n “Where are you going with this, Benny?” Nix asked.\\n\\n He set down his dish and leaned his elbows on his knees. “Look,” he said, “I’m nobody’s idea of a hero, but I don’t think I want to go back to town just yet. In fact, I don’t think I can go back to town, knowing that those other kids are up there.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rot-and-ruin-benny-imura-1/page-38.html","bookId":2581,"book":{"id":2581,"title":"Rot and Ruin (Benny Imura #1)","description":"Storyline: Rot and Ruin (Benny Imura #1) \\n In the zombie-infested, post-apocalyptic America where Benny Imura lives, every teenager must find a job by the time they turn fifteen or get their rations cut in half.
