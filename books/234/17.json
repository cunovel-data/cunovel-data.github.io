if not; speak thou. \n [bbe] And when Hushai came, Absalom said to him, This is what Ahithophel has said: are we to do as he says? if not, what is your suggestion? \n 17:7 [hgb] 户 筛 对 押 沙 龙 说 ， 亚 希 多 弗 这 次 所 定 的 谋 不 善 。 \n [kjv] And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time. \n [bbe] And Hushai said to Absalom, Ahithophel\u0027s idea is not a good one at this time. \n 17:8 [hgb] 户 筛 又 说 ， 你 知 道 ， 你 父 亲 和 跟 随 他 的 人 都 是 勇 士 ， 现 在 他 们 心 里 恼 怒 ， 如 同 田 野 丢 崽 子 的 母 熊 一 般 ， 而 且 你 父 亲 是 个 战 士 ， 必 不 和 民 一 同 住 宿 。 \n [kjv] For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. \n [bbe] Hushai said further, You have knowledge of your father and his men, that they are men of war, and that their feelings are bitter, like those of a bear in the field whose young ones have been taken from her: and your father is a man of war, and will not take his night\u0027s rest with the people; \n 17:9 [hgb] 他 现 今 或 藏 在 坑 中 或 在 别 处 ， 若 有 人 首 先 被 杀 ， 凡 听 见 的 必 说 ， 跟 随 押 沙 龙 的 民 被 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom. \n [bbe] But he will certainly have taken cover now in some hole or secret place; and if some of our people, at the first attack, are overcome, then any hearing of it will say, There is destruction among the people who are on Absalom\u0027s side. \n 17:10 [hgb] 虽 有 人 胆 大 如 狮 子 ， 他 的 心 也 必 消 化 。 因 为 以 色 列 人 都 知 道 你 父 亲 是 英 雄 ， 跟 随 他 的 人 也 都 是 勇 士 。 \n [kjv] And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men. \n [bbe] Then even the strongest, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will become like water; for all Israel is conscious that your father is a man of war, and those who are with him are strong and without fear. \n 17:11 [hgb] 依 我 之 计 ， 不 如 将 以 色 列 众 人 从 但 直 到 别 是 巴 ， 如 同 海 边 的 沙 那 样 多 聚 集 到 你 这 里 来 ， 你 也 亲 自 率 领 他 们 出 战 。 \n [kjv] Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. \n [bbe] But my suggestion is that all Israel, from Dan as far as Beer-sheba, comes together to you, a great army like the sands of the sea in number; and that you yourself go out among them. \n 17:12 [hgb] 这 样 ， 我 们 在 何 处 遇 见 他 ， 就 下 到 他 那 里 ， 如 同 露 水 下 在 地 上 一 般 ， 连 他 带 跟 随 他 的 人 ， 一 个 也 不 留 下 。 \n [kjv] So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one. \n [bbe] Then we will come on him in some place, wherever he may be, falling on him as the dew comes on the earth: and of him and all the men who are with him not one will get away with his life. \n 17:13 [hgb] 他 若 进 了 哪 一 座 城 ， 以 色 列 众 人 必 带 绳 子 去 ， 将 那 城 拉 到 河 里 ， 甚 至 连 一 块 小 石 头 都 不 剩 下 。 \n [kjv] Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there. \n [bbe] And if he has gone into some town, then let all Israel take strong cords to that town, and we will have it pulled into the valley, till not one small stone is to be seen there. \n 17:14 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 和 以 色 列 众 人 说 ， 亚 基 人 户 筛 的 计 谋 比 亚 希 多 弗 的 计 谋 更 好 。 这 是 因 耶 和 华 定 意 破 坏 亚 希 多 弗 的 良 谋 ， 为 要 降 祸 与 押 沙 龙 。 \n [kjv] And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom. \n [bbe] Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, Hushai\u0027s suggestion is better than that of Ahithophel. For it was the purpose of the Lord to make the wise designs of Ahithophel without effect, so that the Lord might send evil on Absalom. \n 17:15 [hgb] 户 筛 对 祭 司 撒 督 和 亚 比 亚 他 说 ， 亚 希 多 弗 为 押 沙 龙 和 以 色 列 的 长 老 所 定 的 计 谋 是 如 此 如 此 ， 我 所 定 的 计 谋 是 如 此 如 此 。 \n [kjv] Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled. \n [bbe] Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, This is the suggestion made by Ahithophel to Absalom and the responsible men of Israel, and this is what I said to them. \n 17:16 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 要 急 速 打 发 人 去 ， 告 诉 大 卫 说 ， 今 夜 不 可 住 在 旷 野 的 渡 口 ， 务 要 过 河 ， 免 得 王 和 跟 随 他 的 人 都 被 吞 灭 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him. \n [bbe] So now send the news quickly to David, and say, Do not take your night\u0027s rest by the way across the river to the waste land, but be certain to go over; or the king and all the people with him will come to destruction. \n 17:17 [hgb] 那 时 ， 约 拿 单 和 亚 希 玛 斯 在 隐 罗 结 那 里 等 候 ， 不 敢 进 城 ， 恐 怕 被 人 看 见 。 有 一 个 使 女 出 来 ， 将 这 话 告 诉 他 们 ， 他 们 就 去 报 信 给 大 卫 王 。 \n [kjv] Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David. \n [bbe] Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting by En-rogel; and a servant-girl went from time to time and gave them news and they went with the news to King David, for it was not wise for them to let themselves be seen coming into the town. \n 17:18 [hgb] 然 而 有 一 个 童 子 看 见 他 们 ， 就 去 告 诉 押 沙 龙 。 他 们 急 忙 跑 到 巴 户 琳 某 人 的 家 里 。 那 人 院 中 有 一 口 井 ， 他 们 就 下 到 井 里 。 \n [kjv] Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man\u0027s house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down. \n [bbe] But a boy saw them, and gave word of it to Absalom: so the two of them went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a water-hole in his garden, and they went down into it. \n 17:19 [hgb] 那 家 的 妇 人 用 盖 盖 上 井 口 ， 又 在 上 头 铺 上 碎 麦 ， 事 就 没 有 泄 漏 。 \n [kjv] And the woman took and spread a covering over the well\u0027s mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known. \n [bbe] And a woman put a cover over the hole, and put crushed grain on top of it, and no one had any knowledge of it. \n 17:20 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 的 仆 人 来 到 那 家 ， 问 妇 人 说 ， 亚 希 玛 斯 和 约 拿 单 在 哪 里 。 妇 人 说 ， 他 们 过 了 河 了 。 仆 人 找 他 们 ， 找 不 着 ， 就 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And when Absalom\u0027s servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. \n [bbe] And Absalom\u0027s servants came to the woman at the house and said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have gone from here to the stream. And after searching for them, and seeing nothing of them, they went back to Jerusalem. \n 17:21 [hgb] 他 们 走 后 ， 二 人 从 井 里 上 来 ， 去 告 诉 大 卫 王 说 ， 亚 希 多 弗 如 此 如 此 定 计 害 你 ， 你 们 务 要 起 来 ， 快 快 过 河 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you. \n [bbe] Then after the servants had gone away, they came up out of the water-hole and went to give King David the news; and they said, Get up and go quickly over the water, for such and such are Ahithophel\u0027s designs against you. \n 17:22 [hgb] 于 是 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 都 起 来 ， 过 约 旦 河 。 到 了 天 亮 ， 无 一 人 不 过 约 旦 河 的 。 \n [kjv] Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan. \n [bbe] So David and all the people who were with him went up over Jordan: when dawn came, every one of them had gone over Jordan. \n 17:23 [hgb] 亚 希 多 弗 见 不 依 从 他 的 计 谋 ， 就 备 上 驴 ， 归 回 本 城 。 到 了 家 ， 留 下 遗 言 ， 便 吊 死 了 ， 葬 在 他 父 亲 的 坟 墓 里 。 \n [kjv] And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. \n [bbe] Now when Ahithophel saw that his suggestion was not acted on, he got his ass ready, and went back to his house, to the town where he came from, and having put his house in order, he put himself to death by hanging; so he came to his end and was put in the resting-place of his father. \n 17:24 [hgb] 大 卫 到 了 玛 哈 念 ， 押 沙 龙 和 跟 随 他 的 以 色 列 人 也 都 过 了 约 旦 河 。 \n [kjv] Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. \n [bbe] And David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom, with all the men of Israel, went over Jordan. \n 17:25 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 立 亚 玛 撒 作 元 帅 ， 代 替 约 押 。 亚 玛 撒 是 以 实 玛 利 人 （ 又 作 以 色 列 人 ） 以 特 拉 的 儿 子 。 以 特 拉 曾 与 拿 辖 的 女 儿 亚 比 该 亲 近 。 这 亚 比 该 与 约 押 的 母 亲 洗 鲁 雅 是 姐 妹 。 \n [kjv] And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man\u0027s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab\u0027s mother. \n [bbe] And Absalom put Amasa at the head of the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had been the lover of Abigail, the daughter of Jesse, sister of Zeruiah, Joab\u0027s mother. \n 17:26 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 和 以 色 列 人 都 安 营 在 基 列 地 。 \n [kjv] So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. \n [bbe] And Israel and Absalom put up their tents in the land of Gilead. \n 17:27 [hgb] 大 卫 到 了 玛 哈 念 ， 亚 扪 族 的 拉 巴 人 拿 辖 的 儿 子 朔 比 ， 罗 底 巴 人 亚 米 利 的 儿 子 玛 吉 ， 基 列 的 罗 基 琳 人 巴 西 莱 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, \n [bbe] Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi, the son of Nahash of Rabbah, the Ammonite, and Machir, the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, \n 17:28 [hgb] 带 着 被 ， 褥 ， 盆 ， 碗 ， 瓦 器 ， 小 麦 ， 大 麦 ， 麦 面 ， 炒 谷 ， 豆 子 ， 红 豆 ， 炒 豆 ， \n [kjv] Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse, \n [bbe] Came with beds and basins and pots, and grain and meal, and all sorts of dry foods, \n 17:29 [hgb] 蜂 蜜 ， 奶 油 ， 绵 羊 ， 奶 饼 ， 供 给 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 吃 。 他 们 说 ， 民 在 旷 野 ， 必 饥 渴 困 乏 了 。 \n [kjv] And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness. \n [bbe] And honey and butter and sheep and milk-cheeses, for David and his people: for they said, This people is in the waste land, needing food and drink and rest. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1492.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
