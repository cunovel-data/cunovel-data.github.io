And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to him, Where have you come from? And he said, I have come in flight from the tents of Israel. \\n\\n 1:4 [hgb] 大 卫 又 问 他 说 ， 事 情 怎 样 。 请 你 告 诉 我 。 他 回 答 说 ， 百 姓 从 阵 上 逃 跑 ， 也 有 许 多 人 仆 倒 死 亡 。 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 约 拿 单 也 死 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to him, How did things go? Give me the news. And in answer he said, The people have gone in flight from the fight, and a great number of them are dead; and Saul and his son Jonathan are dead. \\n\\n 1:5 [hgb] 大 卫 问 报 信 的 少 年 人 说 ， 你 怎 么 知 道 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 约 拿 单 死 了 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to the young man who gave him the news, Why are you certain that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead? \\n\\n 1:6 [hgb] 报 信 的 少 年 人 说 ， 我 偶 然 到 基 利 波 山 ， 看 见 扫 罗 伏 在 自 己 枪 上 ， 有 战 车 ， 马 兵 紧 紧 地 追 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. \\n\\n [bbe] And the young man said, I came by chance to Mount Gilboa, and I saw Saul supporting himself on his spear; and the war-carriages and horsemen overtook him. \\n\\n 1:7 [hgb] 他 回 头 看 见 我 ， 就 呼 叫 我 。 我 说 ， 我 在 这 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I. \\n\\n [bbe] And looking back, he saw me and gave a cry to me. And answering him I said, Here am I. \\n\\n 1:8 [hgb] 他 问 我 说 ， 你 是 什 么 人 。 我 说 ， 我 是 亚 玛 力 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to me, Who are you? And I said, I am an Amalekite. \\n\\n 1:9 [hgb] 他 说 ， 请 你 来 ， 将 我 杀 死 。 因 为 痛 苦 抓 住 我 ， 我 的 生 命 尚 存 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he said to me, Come here to my side, and put me to death, for the pain of death has me in its grip but my life is still strong in me. \\n\\n 1:10 [hgb] 我 准 知 他 仆 倒 必 不 能 活 ， 就 去 将 他 杀 死 ， 把 他 头 上 的 冠 冕 ， 臂 上 的 镯 子 拿 到 我 主 这 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord. \\n\\n [bbe] So I put my foot on him and gave him his death-blow, because I was certain that he would not go on living after his fall: and I took the crown from his head and the band from his arm, and I have them here for my lord. \\n\\n 1:11 [hgb] 大 卫 就 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 跟 随 他 的 人 也 是 如 此 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: \\n\\n [bbe] Then David gave way to bitter grief, and so did all the men who were with him: \\n\\n 1:12 [hgb] 而 且 悲 哀 哭 号 ， 禁 食 到 晚 上 ， 是 因 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 约 拿 单 ， 并 耶 和 华 的 民 以 色 列 家 的 人 ， 倒 在 刀 下 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. \\n\\n [bbe] And till evening they gave themselves to sorrow and weeping, and took no food, weeping for Saul and for Jonathan, his son, and for the people of the Lord and for the men of Israel; because they had come to their end by the sword. \\n\\n 1:13 [hgb] 大 卫 问 报 信 的 少 年 人 说 ， 你 是 哪 里 的 人 。 他 说 ， 我 是 亚 玛 力 客 人 的 儿 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to the young man who had given him the news, Where do you come from? And he said, I am the son of a man from a strange land; I am an Amalekite. \\n\\n 1:14 [hgb] 大 卫 说 ， 你 伸 手 杀 害 耶 和 华 的 受 膏 者 ， 怎 么 不 畏 惧 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD\u0027s anointed? \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to him, Had you no fear of stretching out your hand to put to death the one marked with the holy oil? \\n\\n 1:15 [hgb] 大 卫 叫 了 一 个 少 年 人 来 ， 说 ， 你 去 杀 他 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died. \\n\\n [bbe] And David sent for one of his young men and said, Go near and put an end to him. And he put him to death. \\n\\n 1:16 [hgb] 大 卫 对 他 说 ， 你 流 人 血 的 罪 归 到 自 己 的 头 上 ， 因 为 你 亲 口 作 见 证 说 ， 我 杀 了 耶 和 华 的 受 膏 者 。 少 年 人 就 把 他 杀 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD\u0027s anointed. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to him, May your blood be on your head; for your mouth has given witness against you, saying, I have put to death the man marked with the holy oil. \\n\\n 1:17 [hgb] 大 卫 作 哀 歌 ， 吊 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 约 拿 单 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: \\n\\n [bbe] Then David made this song of grief for Saul and Jonathan, his son: \\n\\n 1:18 [hgb] 且 吩 咐 将 这 歌 教 导 犹 大 人 。 这 歌 名 叫 弓 歌 ， 写 在 雅 煞 珥 书 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.) \\n\\n [bbe] (It is recorded in the book of Jashar for teaching to the sons of Judah) and he said: \\n\\n 1:19 [hgb] 歌 中 说 ， 以 色 列 阿 ， 你 尊 荣 者 在 山 上 被 杀 。 大 英 雄 何 竟 死 亡 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! \\n\\n [bbe] The glory, O Israel, is dead on your high places! How have the great ones been made low! \\n\\n 1:20 [hgb] 不 要 在 迦 特 报 告 。 不 要 在 亚 实 基 伦 街 上 传 扬 。 免 得 非 利 士 的 女 子 欢 乐 。 免 得 未 受 割 礼 之 人 的 女 子 矜 夸 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. \\n\\n [bbe] Give no news of it in Gath, let it not be said in the streets of Ashkelon; or the daughters of the Philistines will be glad, the daughters of men without circumcision will be uplifted in joy. \\n\\n 1:21 [hgb] 基 利 波 山 哪 ， 愿 你 那 里 没 有 雨 露 。 愿 你 田 地 无 土 产 可 作 供 物 。 因 为 英 雄 的 盾 牌 在 那 里 被 污 丢 弃 。 扫 罗 的 盾 牌 仿 佛 未 曾 抹 油 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. \\n\\n [bbe] O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain on you, you fields of death: for there the arms of the strong have been shamed, the arms of Saul, as if he had not been marked with the holy oil. \\n\\n 1:22 [hgb] 约 拿 单 的 弓 箭 非 流 敌 人 的 血 不 退 缩 。 扫 罗 的 刀 剑 非 剖 勇 士 的 油 不 收 回 。 \\n\\n [kjv] From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. \\n\\n [bbe] From the blood of the dead, from the fat of the strong, the bow of Jonathan was not turned back, the sword of Saul did not come back unused. \\n\\n 1:23 [hgb] 扫 罗 和 约 拿 单 ， 活 时 相 悦 相 爱 ， 死 时 也 不 分 离 。 他 们 比 鹰 更 快 ， 比 狮 子 还 强 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. \\n\\n [bbe] Saul and Jonathan were loved and pleasing; in their lives and in their death they were not parted; they went more quickly than eagles, they were stronger than lions. \\n\\n 1:24 [hgb] 以 色 列 的 女 子 阿 ， 当 为 扫 罗 哭 号 。 他 曾 使 你 们 穿 朱 红 色 的 美 衣 ， 使 你 们 衣 服 有 黄 金 的 妆 饰 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. \\n\\n [bbe] O daughters of Israel, have sorrow for Saul, by whom you were delicately clothed in robes of red, with ornaments of gold on your dresses. \\n\\n 1:25 [hgb] 英 雄 何 竟 在 阵 上 仆 倒 。 约 拿 单 何 竟 在 山 上 被 杀 。 \\n\\n [kjv] How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. \\n\\n [bbe] How have the great ones been made low in the fight! Jonathan is dead on your high places. \\n\\n 1:26 [hgb] 我 兄 约 拿 单 哪 ， 我 为 你 悲 伤 。 我 甚 喜 悦 你 。 你 向 我 发 的 爱 情 奇 妙 非 常 ， 过 于 妇 女 的 爱 情 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. \\n\\n [bbe] I am full of grief for you, my brother Jonathan: very dear have you been to me: your love for me was a wonder, greater than the love of women. \\n\\n 1:27 [hgb] 英 雄 何 竟 仆 倒 。 战 具 何 竟 灭 没 。 \\n\\n [kjv] How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! \\n\\n [bbe] How have the great ones been made low, and the arms of war broken! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1476.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
