{"id":7199,"no":21,"title":"Chapter 21","content":"21:1 [hgb] 大 卫 年 间 有 饥 荒 ， 一 连 三 年 ， 大 卫 就 求 问 耶 和 华 。 耶 和 华 说 ， 这 饥 荒 是 因 扫 罗 和 他 流 人 血 之 家 杀 死 基 遍 人 。 [kjv] Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites. [bbe] In the days of David they were short of food for three years, year after year; and David went before the Lord for directions. And the Lord said, On Saul and on his family there is blood, because he put the Gibeonites to death. 21:2 [hgb] 原 来 这 基 遍 人 不 是 以 色 列 人 ， 乃 是 亚 摩 利 人 中 所 剩 的 。 以 色 列 人 曾 向 他 们 起 誓 ， 不 杀 灭 他 们 ， 扫 罗 却 为 以 色 列 人 和 犹 大 人 发 热 心 ， 想 要 杀 灭 他 们 。 大 卫 王 召 了 他 们 来 ， [kjv] And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.) [bbe] Then the king sent for the Gibeonites; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but were the last of the Amorites, to whom the children of Israel had given an oath; but Saul, in his passion for the children of Israel and Judah, had made an attempt on their lives:) 21:3 [hgb] 问 他 们 说 ， 我 当 为 你 们 怎 样 行 呢 ？ 可 用 什 么 赎 这 罪 ， 使 你 们 为 耶 和 华 的 产 业 祝 福 呢 ？ [kjv] Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD? [bbe] So David said to the Gibeonites, What may I do for you? how am I to make up to you for your wrongs, so that you may give a blessing to the heritage of the Lord? 21:4 [hgb] 基 遍 人 回 答 说 ， 我 们 和 扫 罗 与 他 家 的 事 并 不 关 乎 金 银 ， 也 不 要 因 我 们 的 缘 故 杀 一 个 以 色 列 人 。 大 卫 说 ， 你 们 怎 样 说 ， 我 就 为 你 们 怎 样 行 。 [kjv] And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you. [bbe] And the Gibeonites said to him, It is not a question of silver and gold between us and Saul or his family; and it is not in our power to put to death any man in Israel. And he said, Say, then, what am I to do for you? 21:5 [hgb] 他 们 对 王 说 ， 那 从 前 谋 害 我 们 ， 要 灭 我 们 ， 使 我 们 不 得 再 住 以 色 列 境 内 的 人 ， [kjv] And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel, [bbe] And they said to the king, As for the man by whom we were wasted, and who made designs against us to have us completely cut off from the land of Israel, 21:6 [hgb] 现 在 愿 将 他 的 子 孙 七 人 交 给 我 们 ， 我 们 好 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 将 他 们 悬 挂 在 耶 和 华 拣 选 扫 罗 的 基 比 亚 。 王 说 ， 我 必 交 给 你 们 。 [kjv] Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them. [bbe] Let seven men of his family be given up to us and we will put an end to them by hanging them before the Lord in Gibeon, on the hill of the Lord. And the king said, I will give them. 21:7 [hgb] 王 因 为 曾 与 扫 罗 的 儿 子 约 拿 单 指 着 耶 和 华 起 誓 结 盟 ， 就 爱 惜 扫 罗 的 孙 子 ， 约 拿 单 的 儿 子 米 非 波 设 ， 不 交 出 来 。 [kjv] But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD\u0027s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. [bbe] But the king did not give up Mephibosheth, the son of Saul\u0027s son Jonathan, because of the Lord\u0027s oath made between David and Jonathan, the son of Saul. 21:8 [hgb] 却 把 爱 雅 的 女 儿 利 斯 巴 给 扫 罗 所 生 的 两 个 儿 子 亚 摩 尼 ， 米 非 波 设 ， 和 扫 罗 女 儿 米 甲 的 姐 姐 给 米 何 拉 人 巴 西 莱 儿 子 亚 得 列 所 生 的 五 个 儿 子 [kjv] But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite: [bbe] But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Saul to whom Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, had given birth; and the five sons of Saul\u0027s daughter Merab, whose father was Adriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite: 21:9 [hgb] 交 在 基 遍 人 的 手 里 。 基 遍 人 就 把 他 们 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 悬 挂 在 山 上 ， 这 七 人 就 一 同 死 亡 。 被 杀 的 时 候 正 是 收 割 的 日 子 ， 就 是 动 手 割 大 麦 的 时 候 。 [kjv] And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest. [bbe] And he gave them up to the Gibeonites, and they put them to death, hanging them on the mountain before the Lord; all seven came to their end together in the first days of the grain-cutting, at the start of the cutting of the barley. 21:10 [hgb] 爱 雅 的 女 儿 利 斯 巴 用 麻 布 在 磐 石 上 搭 棚 ， 从 动 手 收 割 的 时 候 直 到 天 降 雨 在 尸 身 上 的 时 候 ， 日 间 不 容 空 中 的 雀 鸟 落 在 尸 身 上 ， 夜 间 不 让 田 野 的 走 兽 前 来 糟 践 。 [kjv] And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. [bbe] And Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took haircloth, placing it on the rock as a bed for herself, from the start of the grain-cutting till rain came down on them from heaven; and she did not let the birds of the air come near them by day, or the beasts of the field by night. 21:11 [hgb] 有 人 将 扫 罗 的 妃 嫔 爱 雅 女 儿 利 斯 巴 所 行 的 这 事 告 诉 大 卫 。 [kjv] And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. [bbe] And news was given to David of what Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, one of Saul\u0027s wives, had done. 21:12 [hgb] 大 卫 就 去 ， 从 基 列 雅 比 人 那 里 将 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 约 拿 单 的 骸 骨 搬 了 来 。 是 因 非 利 士 人 从 前 在 基 利 波 杀 扫 罗 ， 将 尸 身 悬 挂 在 伯 珊 的 街 市 上 ， 基 列 雅 比 人 把 尸 身 偷 了 去 。 [kjv] And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa: [bbe] And David went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had taken them away secretly from the public place of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had put them, hanging up the bodies there on the day when they put Saul to death in Gilboa: 21:13 [hgb] 大 卫 将 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 约 拿 单 的 骸 骨 从 那 里 搬 了 来 ， 又 收 殓 被 悬 挂 七 人 的 骸 骨 ， [kjv] And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. [bbe] And he took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from that place; and they got together the bones of those who had been put to death by hanging. 21:14 [hgb] 将 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 约 拿 单 的 骸 骨 葬 在 便 雅 悯 的 洗 拉 ， 在 扫 罗 父 亲 基 士 的 坟 墓 里 。 众 人 行 了 王 所 吩 咐 的 。 此 后 神 垂 听 国 民 所 求 的 。 [kjv] And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land. [bbe] And they put them with the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the resting-place of Kish, his father, in Zela in the country of Benjamin; they did all the king had given them orders to do. And after that, God gave ear to their prayers for the land. 21:15 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 与 以 色 列 人 打 仗 。 大 卫 带 领 仆 人 下 去 ， 与 非 利 士 人 接 战 ， 大 卫 就 疲 乏 了 。 [kjv] Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint. [bbe] And the Philistines went to war again with Israel; and David went down with his people, and while they were at Gob they had a fight with the Philistines: 21:16 [hgb] 伟 人 的 一 个 儿 子 以 实 比 诺 要 杀 大 卫 。 他 的 铜 枪 重 三 百 舍 客 勒 ， 又 佩 着 新 刀 。 [kjv] And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David. [bbe] And there came against David one of the offspring of the Rephaim, whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, and having a new sword, he made an attempt to put David to death. 21:17 [hgb] 但 洗 鲁 雅 的 儿 子 亚 比 筛 帮 助 大 卫 ， 攻 打 非 利 士 人 ， 将 他 杀 死 。 当 日 ， 跟 随 大 卫 的 人 向 大 卫 起 誓 说 ， 以 后 你 不 可 再 与 我 们 一 同 出 战 ， 恐 怕 熄 灭 以 色 列 的 灯 。 [kjv] But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel. [bbe] But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, came to his help, and, turning on the Philistine, gave him his death-blow. Then David\u0027s men took an oath, and said, Never again are you to go out with us to the fight, so that you may not put out the light of Israel. 21:18 [hgb] 后 来 ， 以 色 列 人 在 歌 伯 与 非 利 士 人 打 仗 ， 户 沙 人 西 比 该 杀 了 伟 人 的 一 个 儿 子 撒 弗 。 [kjv] And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant. [bbe] Now after this there was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Sibbecai the Hushathite put to death Saph, one of the offspring of the Rephaim. 21:19 [hgb] 又 在 歌 伯 与 非 利 士 人 打 仗 ， 伯 利 恒 人 雅 雷 俄 珥 金 的 儿 子 伊 勒 哈 难 杀 了 迦 特 人 歌 利 亚 。 这 人 的 枪 杆 粗 如 织 布 的 机 轴 。 [kjv] And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver\u0027s beam. [bbe] And again there was war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan, the son of Jair the Beth-lehemite, put to death Goliath the Gittite, the stem of whose spear was like a cloth-worker\u0027s rod. 21:20 [hgb] 又 在 迦 特 打 仗 ， 那 里 有 一 个 身 量 高 大 的 人 ， 手 脚 都 是 六 指 ， 共 有 二 十 四 个 指 头 。 他 也 是 伟 人 的 儿 子 。 [kjv] And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. [bbe] And again there was war at Gath, where there was a very tall man, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet; he was one of the offspring of the Rephaim. 21:21 [hgb] 这 人 向 以 色 列 人 骂 阵 ， 大 卫 的 哥 哥 示 米 亚 的 儿 子 约 拿 单 就 杀 了 他 。 [kjv] And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him. [bbe] And when he was purposing to put shame on Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimei, David\u0027s brother, put him to death. 21:22 [hgb] 这 四 个 人 是 迦 特 伟 人 的 儿 子 ， 都 死 在 大 卫 和 他 仆 人 的 手 下 。 [kjv] These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. [bbe] These four were of the offspring of the Rephaim in Gath; and they came to their end by the hands of David and his servants.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1496.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
