And Ziba said, The asses be for the king\u0027s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to Ziba, What is your reason for this? And Ziba said, The asses are for the use of the king\u0027s people, and the bread and the fruit are food for the young men; and the wine is for drink for those who are overcome by weariness in the waste land. \\n\\n 16:3 [hgb] 王 问 说 ， 你 主 人 的 儿 子 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 洗 巴 回 答 王 说 ， 他 仍 在 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 因 他 说 ， 以 色 列 人 今 日 必 将 我 父 的 国 归 还 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the king said, And where is thy master\u0027s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. \\n\\n [bbe] And the king said, And where is your master\u0027s son? And Ziba said, He is still at Jerusalem: for he said, Today Israel will give back to me the kingdom of my father. \\n\\n 16:4 [hgb] 王 对 洗 巴 说 ， 凡 属 米 非 波 设 的 都 归 你 了 。 洗 巴 说 ， 我 叩 拜 我 主 我 王 ， 愿 我 在 你 眼 前 蒙 恩 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the king said to Ziba, Truly everything which was Mephibosheth\u0027s is yours. And Ziba said, I give honour to my lord, may I have grace in your eyes, my lord, O king! \\n\\n 16:5 [hgb] 大 卫 王 到 了 巴 户 琳 ， 见 有 一 个 人 出 来 ， 是 扫 罗 族 基 拉 的 儿 子 ， 名 叫 示 每 。 他 一 面 走 一 面 咒 骂 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came. \\n\\n [bbe] And when King David came to Bahurim, a man of Saul\u0027s family named Shimei, the son of Gera, came out from there, calling curses after him. \\n\\n 16:6 [hgb] 又 拿 石 头 砍 大 卫 王 和 王 的 臣 仆 。 众 民 和 勇 士 都 在 王 的 左 右 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. \\n\\n [bbe] And he sent stones at David and at all the king\u0027s servants and at all the people and at all the men of war by his side, on the right hand and on the left. \\n\\n 16:7 [hgb] 示 每 咒 骂 说 ， 你 这 流 人 血 的 坏 人 哪 ， 去 吧 去 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial: \\n\\n [bbe] And Shimei said, with curses, Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, you good-for-nothing: \\n\\n 16:8 [hgb] 你 流 扫 罗 全 家 的 血 ， 接 续 他 作 王 。 耶 和 华 把 这 罪 归 在 你 身 上 ， 将 这 国 交 给 你 儿 子 押 沙 龙 。 现 在 你 自 取 其 祸 ， 因 为 你 是 流 人 血 的 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man. \\n\\n [bbe] The Lord has sent punishment on you for all the blood of the family of Saul, whose kingdom you have taken; and the Lord has given the kingdom to Absalom, your son: now you yourself are taken in your evil, because you are a man of blood. \\n\\n 16:9 [hgb] 洗 鲁 雅 的 儿 子 亚 比 筛 对 王 说 ， 这 死 狗 岂 可 咒 骂 我 主 我 王 呢 ？ 求 你 容 我 过 去 ， 割 下 他 的 头 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, Is this dead dog to go on cursing my lord the king? let me go over and take off his head. \\n\\n 16:10 [hgb] 王 说 ， 洗 鲁 雅 的 儿 子 ， 我 与 你 们 有 何 关 涉 呢 ？ 他 咒 骂 是 因 耶 和 华 吩 咐 他 说 ， 你 要 咒 骂 大 卫 。 如 此 ， 谁 敢 说 你 为 什 么 这 样 行 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? \\n\\n [bbe] And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Let him go on cursing, for the Lord has said, Put a curse on David, and who then may say, Why have you done so? \\n\\n 16:11 [hgb] 大 卫 又 对 亚 比 筛 和 众 臣 仆 说 ， 我 亲 生 的 儿 子 尚 且 寻 索 我 的 性 命 ， 何 况 这 便 雅 悯 人 呢 ？ 由 他 咒 骂 吧 。 因 为 这 是 耶 和 华 吩 咐 他 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, You see how my son, the offspring of my body, has made designs against my life: how much more then may this Benjamite do so? Let him be, and let him go on cursing; for the Lord has given him orders. \\n\\n 16:12 [hgb] 或 者 耶 和 华 见 我 遭 难 ， 为 我 今 日 被 这 人 咒 骂 ， 就 施 恩 与 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day. \\n\\n [bbe] It may be that the Lord will take note of my wrongs, and give me back good in answer to his cursing of me today. \\n\\n 16:13 [hgb] 于 是 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 往 前 行 走 。 示 每 在 大 卫 对 面 山 坡 ， 一 面 行 走 一 面 咒 骂 ， 又 拿 石 头 砍 他 ， 拿 土 扬 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill\u0027s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. \\n\\n [bbe] So David and his men went on their way: and Shimei went by the hillside parallel with them, cursing and sending stones and dust at him. \\n\\n 16:14 [hgb] 王 和 跟 随 他 的 众 人 疲 疲 乏 乏 地 到 了 一 个 地 方 ， 就 在 那 里 歇 息 歇 息 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there. \\n\\n [bbe] And the king and his people came tired to Jordan, and took their rest there. \\n\\n 16:15 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 和 以 色 列 众 人 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 。 亚 希 多 弗 也 与 他 同 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. \\n\\n [bbe] And Absalom and the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. \\n\\n 16:16 [hgb] 大 卫 的 朋 友 亚 基 人 户 筛 去 见 押 沙 龙 ， 对 他 说 ， 愿 王 万 岁 。 愿 王 万 岁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David\u0027s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Hushai the Archite, David\u0027s friend, came to Absalom and said, Long life to the king, long life to the king! \\n\\n 16:17 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 问 户 筛 说 ， 这 是 你 恩 待 朋 友 吗 ？ 为 什 么 不 与 你 的 朋 友 同 去 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? \\n\\n [bbe] And Absalom said, Is this your love for your friend? why did you not go with your friend? \\n\\n 16:18 [hgb] 户 筛 对 押 沙 龙 说 ， 不 然 ， 耶 和 华 和 这 民 ， 并 以 色 列 众 人 所 拣 选 的 ， 我 必 归 顺 他 ， 与 他 同 住 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide. \\n\\n [bbe] And Hushai said to Absalom, Not so; I am for that man whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel have taken as king, and I will take my place with him. \\n\\n 16:19 [hgb] 再 者 ， 我 当 服 事 谁 呢 ？ 岂 不 是 前 王 的 儿 子 吗 ？ 我 怎 样 服 事 你 父 亲 ， 也 必 照 样 服 事 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father\u0027s presence, so will I be in thy presence. \\n\\n [bbe] And more than this! where is my place as a servant? is it not before his son? as I have been your father\u0027s servant, so will I be yours. \\n\\n 16:20 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 对 亚 希 多 弗 说 ， 你 们 出 个 主 意 ， 我 们 怎 样 行 才 好 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your opinion now, what are we to do? \\n\\n 16:21 [hgb] 亚 希 多 弗 对 押 沙 龙 说 ， 你 父 所 留 下 看 守 宫 殿 的 妃 嫔 ， 你 可 以 与 她 们 亲 近 。 以 色 列 众 人 听 见 你 父 亲 憎 恶 你 ， 凡 归 顺 你 人 的 手 就 更 坚 强 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father\u0027s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong. \\n\\n [bbe] And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father\u0027s women who are here looking after his house; then all Israel will have the news that you are hated by your father, and the hands of your supporters will be strong. \\n\\n 16:22 [hgb] 于 是 人 为 押 沙 龙 在 宫 殿 的 平 顶 上 支 搭 帐 棚 。 押 沙 龙 在 以 色 列 众 人 眼 前 ， 与 他 父 的 妃 嫔 亲 近 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father\u0027s concubines in the sight of all Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] So they put up the tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father\u0027s women before the eyes of all Israel. \\n\\n 16:23 [hgb] 那 时 亚 希 多 弗 所 出 的 主 意 好 像 人 问 神 的 话 一 样 。 他 昔 日 给 大 卫 ， 今 日 给 押 沙 龙 所 出 的 主 意 ， 都 是 这 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. \\n\\n [bbe] In those days the opinions of Ahithophel were valued as highly as if through him a man might get direction from God; so were they valued by David as much as by Absalom. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1491.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
