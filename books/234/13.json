{"id":7191,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"13:1 [hgb] 大 卫 的 儿 子 押 沙 龙 有 一 个 美 貌 的 妹 子 ， 名 叫 他 玛 。 大 卫 的 儿 子 暗 嫩 爱 她 。 [kjv] And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. [bbe] Now after this, it came about that Absalom, David\u0027s son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and David\u0027s son Amnon was in love with her. 13:2 [hgb] 暗 嫩 为 他 妹 子 他 玛 忧 急 成 病 。 他 玛 还 是 处 女 ， 暗 嫩 以 为 难 向 她 行 事 。 [kjv] And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her. [bbe] And he was so deeply in love that he became ill because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin, and so it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her. 13:3 [hgb] 暗 嫩 有 一 个 朋 友 ， 名 叫 约 拿 达 ， 是 大 卫 长 兄 示 米 亚 的 儿 子 。 这 约 拿 达 为 人 极 其 狡 猾 。 [kjv] But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David\u0027s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man. [bbe] But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David\u0027s brother: and Jonadab was a very wise man. 13:4 [hgb] 他 问 暗 嫩 说 ， 王 的 儿 子 阿 ， 为 何 一 天 比 一 天 瘦 弱 呢 ？ 请 你 告 诉 我 。 暗 嫩 回 答 说 ， 我 爱 我 兄 弟 押 沙 龙 的 妹 子 他 玛 。 [kjv] And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king\u0027s son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom\u0027s sister. [bbe] And he said to him, O son of the king, why are you getting thinner day by day? will you not say what your trouble is? And Amnon said to him, I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom\u0027s sister. 13:5 [hgb] 约 拿 达 说 ， 你 不 如 躺 在 床 上 装 病 。 你 父 亲 来 看 你 ， 就 对 他 说 ， 求 父 叫 我 妹 子 他 玛 来 ， 在 我 眼 前 预 备 食 物 ， 递 给 我 吃 ， 使 我 看 见 ， 好 从 她 手 里 接 过 来 吃 。 [kjv] And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand. [bbe] Then Jonadab said to him, Go to your bed, and let it seem that you are ill: and when your father comes to see you, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread, and get the food ready before my eyes, so that I may see it and take it from her hand. 13:6 [hgb] 于 是 暗 嫩 躺 卧 装 病 。 王 来 看 他 ， 他 对 王 说 ， 求 父 叫 我 妹 子 他 玛 来 ， 在 我 眼 前 为 我 作 两 个 饼 ， 我 好 从 她 手 里 接 过 来 吃 。 [kjv] So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand. [bbe] So Amnon went to bed and made himself seem ill: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let my sister Tamar come and make me one or two cakes before my eyes, so that I may take food from her hand. 13:7 [hgb] 大 卫 就 打 发 人 到 宫 里 ， 对 他 玛 说 ， 你 往 你 哥 哥 暗 嫩 的 屋 里 去 ， 为 他 预 备 食 物 。 [kjv] Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon\u0027s house, and dress him meat. [bbe] Then David sent to the house for Tamar and said, Go now to your brother Amnon\u0027s house and get a meal for him. 13:8 [hgb] 他 玛 就 到 她 哥 哥 暗 嫩 的 屋 里 。 暗 嫩 正 躺 卧 。 他 玛 抟 面 ， 在 他 眼 前 作 饼 ， 且 烤 熟 了 ， [kjv] So Tamar went to her brother Amnon\u0027s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. [bbe] So Tamar went to her brother Amnon\u0027s house; and he was in bed. And she took paste and made cakes before his eyes, cooking them over the fire. 13:9 [hgb] 在 他 面 前 将 饼 从 锅 里 倒 出 来 ， 他 却 不 肯 吃 ， 便 说 ， 众 人 离 开 我 出 去 吧 。 众 人 就 都 离 开 他 ， 出 去 了 。 [kjv] And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him. [bbe] And she took the cooking-pot, and put the cakes before him, but he would not take them. And Amnon said, Let everyone go away from me. So they all went out. 13:10 [hgb] 暗 嫩 对 他 玛 说 ， 你 把 食 物 拿 进 卧 房 ， 我 好 从 你 手 里 接 过 来 吃 。 他 玛 就 把 所 作 的 饼 拿 进 卧 房 ， 到 她 哥 哥 暗 嫩 那 里 ， [kjv] And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. [bbe] Then Amnon said to Tamar, Take the food and come into my bedroom, so that I may take it from your hand. So Tamar took the cakes she had made and went with them into her brother Amnon\u0027s bedroom. 13:11 [hgb] 拿 着 饼 上 前 给 他 吃 ， 他 便 拉 住 他 玛 ， 说 ， 我 妹 妹 ， 你 来 与 我 同 寝 。 [kjv] And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister. [bbe] And when she took them to give them to him, he put his arms round her and said, Come to bed, my sister. 13:12 [hgb] 他 玛 说 ， 我 哥 哥 ， 不 要 玷 辱 我 。 以 色 列 人 中 不 当 这 样 行 ， 你 不 要 作 这 丑 事 。 [kjv] And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly. [bbe] And answering him, she said, O my brother, do not put shame on me; it is not right for such a thing to be done in Israel: do not this evil thing. 13:13 [hgb] 你 玷 辱 了 我 ， 我 何 以 掩 盖 我 的 羞 耻 呢 ？ 你 在 以 色 列 中 也 成 了 愚 妄 人 。 你 可 以 求 王 ， 他 必 不 禁 止 我 归 你 。 [kjv] And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. [bbe] What will become of me in my shame? and as for you, you will be looked down on with disgust by all Israel. Now then, go and make your request to the king, for he will not keep me from you. 13:14 [hgb] 但 暗 嫩 不 肯 听 她 的 话 ， 因 比 她 力 大 ， 就 玷 辱 她 ， 与 她 同 寝 。 [kjv] Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her. [bbe] But he would not give attention to what she said: but being stronger than she, he took her by force, and had connection with her. 13:15 [hgb] 随 后 ， 暗 嫩 极 其 恨 她 ， 那 恨 她 的 心 比 先 前 爱 她 的 心 更 甚 ， 对 她 说 ， 你 起 来 ， 去 吧 。 [kjv] Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone. [bbe] Then Amnon was full of hate for her, hating her with a hate greater than his earlier love for her. And he said to her, Get up and be gone. 13:16 [hgb] 他 玛 说 ， 不 要 这 样 。 你 赶 出 我 去 的 这 罪 比 你 才 行 的 更 重 。 但 暗 嫩 不 肯 听 她 的 话 ， [kjv] And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her. [bbe] And she said to him, Not so, my brother, for this great wrong in sending me away is worse than what you did to me before. But he gave no attention to her. 13:17 [hgb] 就 叫 伺 候 自 己 的 仆 人 来 ， 说 ， 将 这 个 女 子 赶 出 去 。 她 一 出 去 ， 你 就 关 门 ， 上 闩 。 [kjv] Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her. [bbe] Then he gave a cry to the servant who was waiting on him and said, Put this woman out, and let the door be locked after her. 13:18 [hgb] 那 时 他 玛 穿 着 彩 衣 ， 因 为 没 有 出 嫁 的 公 主 都 是 这 样 穿 。 暗 嫩 的 仆 人 就 把 她 赶 出 去 ， 关 门 上 闩 。 [kjv] And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king\u0027s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. [bbe] Now she had on a long robe, such as in past times the king\u0027s virgin daughters were dressed in. Then the servant put her out, locking the door after her. 13:19 [hgb] 他 玛 把 灰 尘 撒 在 头 上 ， 撕 裂 所 穿 的 彩 衣 ， 以 手 抱 头 ， 一 面 行 走 ， 一 面 哭 喊 。 [kjv] And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying. [bbe] And Tamar, in her grief, put dust on her head; and she put her hand on her head and went away crying loudly. 13:20 [hgb] 她 胞 兄 押 沙 龙 问 她 说 ， 莫 非 你 哥 哥 暗 嫩 与 你 亲 近 了 吗 ？ 我 妹 妹 ， 暂 且 不 要 作 声 ， 他 是 你 的 哥 哥 ， 不 要 将 这 事 放 在 心 上 。 他 玛 就 孤 孤 单 单 地 住 在 她 胞 兄 押 沙 龙 家 里 。 [kjv] And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom\u0027s house. [bbe] And her brother Absalom said to her, Has your brother Amnon been with you? but now, let there be an end to your crying, my sister: he is your brother, do not take this thing to heart. So Tamar went on living uncomforted in her brother\u0027s house. 13:21 [hgb] 大 卫 王 听 见 这 事 ， 就 甚 发 怒 。 [kjv] But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. [bbe] But when King David had news of all these things he was very angry; but he did not make trouble for Amnon his son, for he was dear to David, being his oldest son. 13:22 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 并 不 和 他 哥 哥 暗 嫩 说 好 说 歹 。 因 为 暗 嫩 玷 辱 他 妹 妹 他 玛 ， 所 以 押 沙 龙 恨 恶 他 。 [kjv] And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. [bbe] But Absalom said nothing to his brother Amnon, good or bad: for he was full of hate for him, because he had taken his sister Tamar by force. 13:23 [hgb] 过 了 二 年 ， 在 靠 近 以 法 莲 的 巴 力 夏 琐 有 人 为 押 沙 龙 剪 羊 毛 。 押 沙 龙 请 王 的 众 子 与 他 同 去 。 [kjv] And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king\u0027s sons. [bbe] Now after two full years, Absalom had men cutting the wool of his sheep in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim: and he sent for all the king\u0027s sons to come to his feast. 13:24 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 来 见 王 ， 说 ， 现 在 有 人 为 仆 人 剪 羊 毛 ， 请 王 和 王 的 臣 仆 与 仆 人 同 去 。 [kjv] And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant. [bbe] And Absalom came to the king and said, See now, your servant is cutting the wool of his sheep; will the king and his servants be pleased to come? 13:25 [hgb] 王 对 押 沙 龙 说 ， 我 儿 ， 我 们 不 必 都 去 ， 恐 怕 使 你 耗 费 太 多 。 押 沙 龙 再 三 请 王 ， 王 仍 是 不 肯 去 ， 只 为 他 祝 福 。 [kjv] And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him. [bbe] And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, or the number will be over-great for you. And he made his request again, but he would not go, but he gave him his blessing. 13:26 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 说 ， 王 若 不 去 ， 求 王 许 我 哥 哥 暗 嫩 同 去 。 王 说 ， 何 必 要 他 去 呢 ？ [kjv] Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee? [bbe] Then Absalom said, If you will not go, then let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Is there any reason for him to go with you? 13:27 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 再 三 求 王 ， 王 就 许 暗 嫩 和 王 的 众 子 与 他 同 去 。 [kjv] But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king\u0027s sons go with him. [bbe] But Absalom went on requesting him till he let Amnon and all the king\u0027s sons go with him. And Absalom made a great feast like a feast for a king. 13:28 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 吩 咐 仆 人 说 ， 你 们 注 意 ， 看 暗 嫩 饮 酒 畅 快 的 时 候 ， 我 对 你 们 说 杀 暗 嫩 ， 你 们 便 杀 他 ， 不 要 惧 怕 。 这 不 是 我 吩 咐 你 们 的 吗 ？ 你 们 只 管 壮 胆 奋 勇 。 [kjv] Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon\u0027s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant. [bbe] Now Absalom had given orders to his servants, saying, Now take note when Amnon\u0027s heart is glad with wine; and when I say to you, Make an attack on Amnon, then put him to death without fear: have I not given you orders? be strong and without fear. 13:29 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 的 仆 人 就 照 押 沙 龙 所 吩 咐 的 ， 向 暗 嫩 行 了 。 王 的 众 子 都 起 来 ， 各 人 骑 上 骡 子 ， 逃 跑 了 。 [kjv] And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king\u0027s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled. [bbe] So Absalom\u0027s servants did to Amnon as Absalom had given them orders. Then all the king\u0027s sons got up, and every man got on his beast and went in flight. 13:30 [hgb] 他 们 还 在 路 上 ， 有 风 声 传 到 大 卫 那 里 ， 说 ， 押 沙 龙 将 王 的 众 子 都 杀 了 ， 没 有 留 下 一 个 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king\u0027s sons, and there is not one of them left. [bbe] Now while they were on their way, news was given to David that Absalom had put to death all the sons of the king and that not one of them was still living. 13:31 [hgb] 王 就 起 来 ， 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 躺 在 地 上 。 王 的 臣 仆 也 都 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 站 在 旁 边 。 [kjv] Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. [bbe] Then the king got up in great grief, stretching himself out on the earth: and all his servants were by his side, with their clothing parted. 13:32 [hgb] 大 卫 的 长 兄 ， 示 米 亚 的 儿 子 约 拿 达 说 ， 我 主 ， 不 要 以 为 王 的 众 子 少 年 人 都 杀 了 ， 只 有 暗 嫩 一 个 人 死 了 。 自 从 暗 嫩 玷 辱 押 沙 龙 妹 子 他 玛 的 那 日 ， 押 沙 龙 就 定 意 杀 暗 嫩 了 。 [kjv] And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David\u0027s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king\u0027s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. [bbe] And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David\u0027s brother, said, Let not my lord have the idea that all the sons of the king have been put to death; for only Amnon is dead: this has been purposed by Absalom from the day when he took his sister Tamar by force. 13:33 [hgb] 现 在 ， 我 主 我 王 ， 不 要 把 这 事 放 在 心 上 ， 以 为 王 的 众 子 都 死 了 ， 只 有 暗 嫩 一 个 人 死 了 。 [kjv] Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king\u0027s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead. [bbe] So now, let not my lord the king take this thing to heart, with the idea that all the king\u0027s sons are dead: for only Amnon is dead. 13:34 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 逃 跑 了 。 守 望 的 少 年 人 举 目 观 看 ， 见 有 许 多 人 从 山 坡 的 路 上 来 。 [kjv] But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him. [bbe] But Absalom went in flight. And the young man who kept the watch, lifting up his eyes, saw that a great band of people was coming down the slope by the way of the Horons; and the watchman came and gave word to the king, saying, I saw men coming down by the way of the Horons, from the hillside. 13:35 [hgb] 约 拿 达 对 王 说 ， 看 哪 ， 王 的 众 子 都 来 了 ， 果 然 与 你 仆 人 所 说 的 相 合 。 [kjv] And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king\u0027s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is. [bbe] And Jonadab said to the king, See, the king\u0027s sons are coming; as your servant said, so it is. 13:36 [hgb] 话 才 说 完 ， 王 的 众 子 都 到 了 ， 放 声 大 哭 ， 王 和 臣 仆 也 都 哭 得 甚 恸 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king\u0027s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore. [bbe] And while he was talking, the king\u0027s sons came, with weeping and loud cries: and the king and all his servants were weeping bitterly. 13:37 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 逃 到 基 述 王 亚 米 忽 的 儿 子 达 买 那 里 去 了 。 大 卫 天 天 为 他 儿 子 悲 哀 。 [kjv] But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. [bbe] So Absalom went in flight and came to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur, where he was for three years. 13:38 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 逃 到 基 述 ， 在 那 里 住 了 三 年 。 [kjv] So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. [bbe] And the king was sorrowing for his son all the time. 13:39 [hgb] 暗 嫩 死 了 以 后 ， 大 卫 王 得 了 安 慰 ， 心 里 切 切 想 念 押 沙 龙 。 [kjv] And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead. [bbe] And the heart of David was wasted with desire for Absalom: for he was comforted for the death of Amnon.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1488.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
