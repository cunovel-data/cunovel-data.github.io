These were born to David in Hebron. \\n\\n [bbe] And the sixth, Ithream, whose mother was David\u0027s wife Eglah. These were the sons of David, whose birth took place in Hebron. \\n\\n 3:6 [hgb] 扫 罗 家 和 大 卫 家 争 战 的 时 候 ， 押 尼 珥 在 扫 罗 家 大 有 权 势 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul. \\n\\n [bbe] Now while there was war between Saul\u0027s people and David\u0027s people, Abner was making himself strong among the supporters of Saul. \\n\\n 3:7 [hgb] 扫 罗 有 一 妃 嫔 ， 名 叫 利 斯 巴 ， 是 爱 亚 的 女 儿 。 一 日 ， 伊 施 波 设 对 押 尼 珥 说 ， 你 为 什 么 与 我 父 的 妃 嫔 同 房 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father\u0027s concubine? \\n\\n [bbe] Now Saul had among his wives a woman named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Why have you taken my father\u0027s wife? \\n\\n 3:8 [hgb] 押 尼 珥 因 伊 施 波 设 的 话 就 甚 发 怒 ， 说 ， 我 岂 是 犹 大 的 狗 头 呢 ？ 我 恩 待 你 父 扫 罗 的 家 和 他 的 弟 兄 ， 朋 友 ， 不 将 你 交 在 大 卫 手 里 ， 今 日 你 竟 为 这 妇 人 责 备 我 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog\u0027s head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman? \\n\\n [bbe] And Abner was very angry at the words of Ish-bosheth, and he said, Am I a dog\u0027s head of Judah? I am this day doing all in my power for the cause of your father Saul and for his brothers and his friends, and have not given you up into the hands of David, and now you say I have done wrong with a woman. \\n\\n 3:9 [hgb] 我 若 不 照 着 耶 和 华 起 誓 应 许 大 卫 的 话 行 ， 废 去 扫 罗 的 位 ， 建 立 大 卫 的 位 ， 使 他 治 理 以 色 列 和 犹 大 ， 从 但 直 到 别 是 巴 ， 愿 神 重 重 地 降 罚 与 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him; \\n\\n [bbe] May God\u0027s punishment be on Abner, if I do not for David as the Lord in his oath has said, \\n\\n 3:10 [hgb] \\n\\n [kjv] To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba. \\n\\n [bbe] And if I do not take away the kingdom from the family of Saul and make David ruler over Israel and Judah from Dan as far as Beer-sheba! \\n\\n 3:11 [hgb] 伊 施 波 设 惧 怕 押 尼 珥 ， 不 敢 回 答 一 句 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him. \\n\\n [bbe] And so great was Ish-bosheth\u0027s fear of Abner that he was not able to say a word in answer. \\n\\n 3:12 [hgb] 押 尼 珥 打 发 人 去 见 大 卫 ， 替 他 说 ， 这 国 归 谁 呢 ？ 又 说 ， 你 与 我 立 约 ， 我 必 帮 助 你 ， 使 以 色 列 人 都 归 服 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abner sent men to David at Hebron, saying, Make an agreement with me, and I will give you my support in getting all Israel on your side. \\n\\n 3:13 [hgb] 大 卫 说 ， 好 。 我 与 你 立 约 。 但 有 一 件 ， 你 来 见 我 面 的 时 候 ， 若 不 将 扫 罗 的 女 儿 米 甲 带 来 ， 必 不 得 见 我 的 面 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul\u0027s daughter, when thou comest to see my face. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, It is well; I will make an agreement with you, but on one condition, which is, that when you come before me, Saul\u0027s daughter Michal is to come with you; till she comes you will not see my face. \\n\\n 3:14 [hgb] 大 卫 就 打 发 人 去 见 扫 罗 的 儿 子 伊 施 波 设 ， 说 ， 你 要 将 我 的 妻 米 甲 归 还 我 。 她 是 我 从 前 用 一 百 非 利 士 人 的 阳 皮 所 聘 定 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul\u0027s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines. \\n\\n [bbe] And David sent men to Saul\u0027s son Ish-bosheth, saying, Give me back Michal, my wife, whom I made mine for the price of the private parts of a hundred Philistines. \\n\\n 3:15 [hgb] 伊 施 波 设 就 打 发 人 去 ， 将 米 甲 从 拉 亿 的 儿 子 ， 她 丈 夫 帕 铁 那 里 接 回 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish. \\n\\n [bbe] So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel, the son of Laish. \\n\\n 3:16 [hgb] 米 甲 的 丈 夫 跟 着 她 ， 一 面 走 一 面 哭 ， 直 跟 到 巴 户 琳 。 押 尼 珥 说 ， 你 回 去 吧 。 帕 铁 就 回 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned. \\n\\n [bbe] And her husband went with her as far as Bahurim, weeping while he went. Then Abner said to him, Go back. And he went back. \\n\\n 3:17 [hgb] 押 尼 珥 对 以 色 列 长 老 说 ， 从 前 你 们 愿 意 大 卫 作 王 治 理 你 们 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you: \\n\\n [bbe] Then Abner had a talk with the chief men of Israel, saying, In the past it was your desire to make David your king: so now, do it: \\n\\n 3:18 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 可 以 照 心 愿 而 行 。 因 为 耶 和 华 曾 论 到 大 卫 说 ， 我 必 借 我 仆 人 大 卫 的 手 ， 救 我 民 以 色 列 脱 离 非 利 士 人 和 众 仇 敌 的 手 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies. \\n\\n [bbe] For the Lord has said of David, By the hand of my servant David I will make my people Israel safe from the Philistines, and from all who are against them. \\n\\n 3:19 [hgb] 押 尼 珥 也 用 这 话 说 给 便 雅 悯 人 听 ， 又 到 希 伯 仑 ， 将 以 色 列 人 和 便 雅 悯 全 家 一 切 所 喜 悦 的 事 说 给 大 卫 听 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abner said the same things to Benjamin: and he went to David in Hebron to make clear to him what seemed good to Israel and to all the people of Benjamin. \\n\\n 3:20 [hgb] 押 尼 珥 带 着 二 十 个 人 来 到 希 伯 仑 见 大 卫 ， 大 卫 就 为 押 尼 珥 和 他 带 来 的 人 设 摆 筵 席 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. \\n\\n [bbe] So Abner, with twenty men, came to Hebron, to David. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him. \\n\\n 3:21 [hgb] 押 尼 珥 对 大 卫 说 ， 我 要 起 身 去 招 聚 以 色 列 众 人 来 见 我 主 我 王 ， 与 你 立 约 ， 你 就 可 以 照 着 心 愿 作 王 。 于 是 大 卫 送 押 尼 珥 去 ， 押 尼 珥 就 平 平 安 安 地 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. \\n\\n [bbe] And Abner said to David, Now I will go, and make all Israel come to my lord the king, so that they may make an agreement with you, and your kingdom may be as wide as your heart\u0027s desire. Then David sent Abner away and he went in peace. \\n\\n 3:22 [hgb] 约 押 和 大 卫 的 仆 人 攻 击 敌 军 ， 带 回 许 多 的 掠 物 。 那 时 押 尼 珥 不 在 希 伯 仑 大 卫 那 里 ， 因 大 卫 已 经 送 他 去 ， 他 也 平 平 安 安 地 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the servants of David and Joab had been out attacking a band of armed men, and they came back with a great store of goods taken in the fight: but Abner was no longer in Hebron with David, for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace. \\n\\n 3:23 [hgb] 约 押 和 跟 随 他 的 全 军 到 了 ， 就 有 人 告 诉 约 押 说 ， 尼 珥 的 儿 子 押 尼 珥 来 见 王 ， 王 送 他 去 ， 他 也 平 平 安 安 地 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. \\n\\n [bbe] When Joab and his men came, news was given them that Abner, the son of Ner, had come to the king, who had let him go away again in peace. \\n\\n 3:24 [hgb] 约 押 去 见 王 说 ， 你 这 是 作 什 么 呢 ？ 押 尼 珥 来 见 你 ， 你 为 何 送 他 去 ， 他 就 踪 影 不 见 了 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? \\n\\n [bbe] Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? when Abner came to you why did you send him away and let him go? \\n\\n 3:25 [hgb] 你 当 晓 得 ， 尼 珥 的 儿 子 押 尼 珥 来 是 要 诓 哄 你 ， 要 知 道 你 的 出 入 和 你 一 切 所 行 的 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest. \\n\\n [bbe] Is it not clear to you that Abner, the son of Ner, came with deceit to get knowledge of your going out and your coming in and of all you are doing? \\n\\n 3:26 [hgb] 约 押 从 大 卫 那 里 出 来 ， 就 打 发 人 去 追 赶 押 尼 珥 ， 在 西 拉 井 追 上 他 ， 将 他 带 回 来 ， 大 卫 却 不 知 道 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Joab had come out from David, he sent men after Abner, and they overtook him at the water-spring of Sirah, and made him come back with them: but David had no knowledge of it. \\n\\n 3:27 [hgb] 押 尼 珥 回 到 希 伯 仑 ， 约 押 领 他 到 城 门 的 瓮 洞 ， 假 作 要 与 他 说 机 密 话 ， 就 在 那 里 刺 透 他 的 肚 腹 ， 他 便 死 了 。 这 是 报 杀 他 兄 弟 亚 撒 黑 的 仇 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Abner was back in Hebron, Joab took him on one side by the doorway of the town to have a word with him quietly, and there he gave him a wound in the stomach, causing his death in payment for the death of his brother Asahel. \\n\\n 3:28 [hgb] 大 卫 听 见 了 ， 就 说 ， 流 尼 珥 的 儿 子 押 尼 珥 的 血 ， 这 罪 在 耶 和 华 面 前 必 永 不 归 我 和 我 的 国 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner: \\n\\n [bbe] And when David had word of it he said, May I and my kingdom be clear for ever in the eyes of the Lord from the blood of Abner, the son of Ner: \\n\\n 3:29 [hgb] 愿 流 他 血 的 罪 归 到 约 押 头 上 和 他 父 的 全 家 。 又 愿 约 押 家 不 断 有 患 漏 症 的 ， 长 大 麻 疯 的 ， 架 拐 而 行 的 ， 被 刀 杀 死 的 ， 缺 乏 饮 食 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father\u0027s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread. \\n\\n [bbe] May it come on the head of Joab and all his father\u0027s family: among the men of Joab\u0027s family may there ever be some who are diseased or lepers, or who do the work of women, or are put to the sword, or are wasted from need of food! \\n\\n 3:30 [hgb] 约 押 和 他 兄 弟 亚 比 筛 杀 了 押 尼 珥 ， 是 因 押 尼 珥 在 基 遍 争 战 的 时 候 杀 了 他 们 的 兄 弟 亚 撒 黑 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. \\n\\n [bbe] So Joab and Abishai his brother put Abner to death, because he had put to death their brother Asahel in the fight at Gibeon. \\n\\n 3:31 [hgb] 大 卫 吩 咐 约 押 和 跟 随 他 的 众 人 说 ， 你 们 当 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 腰 束 麻 布 ， 在 押 尼 珥 棺 前 哀 哭 。 大 卫 王 也 跟 在 棺 后 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to Joab and all the people who were with him, Go in grief and put haircloth about you, in sorrow for Abner. And King David went after the dead body. \\n\\n 3:32 [hgb] 他 们 将 押 尼 珥 葬 在 希 伯 仑 。 王 在 押 尼 珥 的 墓 旁 放 声 而 哭 ， 众 民 也 都 哭 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. \\n\\n [bbe] And they put Abner\u0027s body to rest in Hebron; and the king and all the people were weeping loudly by the resting-place of Abner\u0027s body. \\n\\n 3:33 [hgb] 王 为 押 尼 珥 举 哀 ， 说 ， 押 尼 珥 何 竟 像 愚 顽 人 死 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth? \\n\\n [bbe] And the king made a song of grief for Abner and said, Was the death of Abner to be like the death of a foolish man? \\n\\n 3:34 [hgb] 你 手 未 曾 捆 绑 ， 脚 未 曾 锁 住 。 你 死 ， 如 人 死 在 罪 孽 之 辈 手 下 一 样 。 于 是 众 民 又 为 押 尼 珥 哀 哭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him. \\n\\n [bbe] Your hands were free, your feet were not chained: like the downfall of a man before evil men, so was your fall. And the weeping of the people over him went on again. \\n\\n 3:35 [hgb] 日 头 未 落 的 时 候 ， 众 民 来 劝 大 卫 吃 饭 ， 但 大 卫 起 誓 说 ， 我 若 在 日 头 未 落 以 前 吃 饭 ， 或 吃 别 物 ， 愿 神 重 重 地 降 罚 与 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down. \\n\\n [bbe] And the people came to make David take food, while it was still day, but David with an oath said, May God\u0027s punishment be on me if I take a taste of bread or any other thing till the sun has gone down! \\n\\n 3:36 [hgb] 众 民 知 道 了 就 都 喜 悦 。 凡 王 所 行 的 ， 众 民 无 不 喜 悦 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people. \\n\\n [bbe] And all the people took note of it and were pleased: like everything the king did, it was pleasing to the people. \\n\\n 3:37 [hgb] 那 日 ， 以 色 列 众 民 才 知 道 杀 尼 珥 的 儿 子 押 尼 珥 并 非 出 于 王 意 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. \\n\\n [bbe] So it was clear to Israel and to all the people on that day that the king was not responsible for the death of Abner, the son of Ner. \\n\\n 3:38 [hgb] 王 对 臣 仆 说 ， 你 们 岂 不 知 今 日 以 色 列 人 中 死 了 一 个 作 元 帅 的 大 丈 夫 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? \\n\\n [bbe] And the king said to his servants, Do you not see that a chief and a great man has come to his end today in Israel? \\n\\n 3:39 [hgb] 我 虽 然 受 膏 为 王 ， 今 日 还 是 软 弱 。 这 洗 鲁 雅 的 两 个 儿 子 比 我 刚 强 。 愿 耶 和 华 照 着 恶 人 所 行 的 恶 报 应 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness. \\n\\n [bbe] While I, though I am crowned king, have little strength, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are out of my control: may the Lord give to the evil-doer the reward of his evil-doing! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1478.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
