And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord sent Nathan to David. And Nathan came to him and said, There were two men in the same town: one a man of great wealth, and the other a poor man. \\n\\n 12:2 [hgb] 富 户 有 许 多 牛 群 羊 群 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: \\n\\n [bbe] The man of wealth had great numbers of flocks and herds; \\n\\n 12:3 [hgb] 穷 人 除 了 所 买 来 养 活 的 一 只 小 母 羊 羔 之 外 ， 别 无 所 有 。 羊 羔 在 他 家 里 和 他 儿 女 一 同 长 大 ， 吃 他 所 吃 的 ， 喝 他 所 喝 的 ， 睡 在 他 怀 中 ， 在 他 看 来 如 同 女 儿 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. \\n\\n [bbe] But the poor man had only one little she-lamb, which he had got and taken care of: from its birth it had been with him like one of his children; his meat was its food, and from his cup it took its drink, resting in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him. \\n\\n 12:4 [hgb] 有 一 客 人 来 到 这 富 户 家 里 。 富 户 舍 不 得 从 自 己 的 牛 群 羊 群 中 取 一 只 预 备 给 客 人 吃 ， 却 取 了 那 穷 人 的 羊 羔 ， 预 备 给 客 人 吃 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man\u0027s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him. \\n\\n [bbe] Now a traveller came to the house of the man of wealth, but he would not take anything from his flock or his herd to make a meal for the traveller who had come to him, but he took the poor man\u0027s lamb and made it ready for the man who had come. \\n\\n 12:5 [hgb] 大 卫 就 甚 恼 怒 那 人 ， 对 拿 单 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 行 这 事 的 人 该 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David\u0027s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die: \\n\\n [bbe] And David was full of wrath against that man; and he said to Nathan, By the living Lord, death is the right punishment for the man who has done this: \\n\\n 12:6 [hgb] 他 必 偿 还 羊 羔 四 倍 。 因 为 他 行 这 事 ， 没 有 怜 恤 的 心 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. \\n\\n [bbe] And he will have to give back four times the value of the lamb, because he has done this and because he had no pity. \\n\\n 12:7 [hgb] 拿 单 对 大 卫 说 ， 你 就 是 那 人 。 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 我 膏 你 作 以 色 列 的 王 ， 救 你 脱 离 扫 罗 的 手 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; \\n\\n [bbe] And Nathan said to David, You are that man. The Lord God of Israel says, I made you king over Israel, putting holy oil on you, and I kept you safe from the hands of Saul; \\n\\n 12:8 [hgb] 我 将 你 主 人 的 家 业 赐 给 你 ， 将 你 主 人 的 妻 交 在 你 怀 里 ， 又 将 以 色 列 和 犹 大 家 赐 给 你 。 你 若 还 以 为 不 足 ， 我 早 就 加 倍 地 赐 给 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I gave thee thy master\u0027s house, and thy master\u0027s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. \\n\\n [bbe] I gave you your master\u0027s daughter and your master\u0027s wives for yourself, and I gave you the daughters of Israel and Judah; and if that had not been enough, I would have given you such and such things. \\n\\n 12:9 [hgb] 你 为 什 么 藐 视 耶 和 华 的 命 令 ， 行 他 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 呢 ？ 你 借 亚 扪 人 的 刀 杀 害 赫 人 乌 利 亚 ， 又 娶 了 他 的 妻 为 妻 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. \\n\\n [bbe] Why then have you had no respect for the word of the Lord, doing what is evil in his eyes? You have put Uriah the Hittite to death with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife; you have put him to death with the sword of the children of Ammon. \\n\\n 12:10 [hgb] 你 既 藐 视 我 ， 娶 了 赫 人 乌 利 亚 的 妻 为 妻 ， 所 以 刀 剑 必 永 不 离 开 你 的 家 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. \\n\\n [bbe] So now the sword will never be turned away from your family; because you have had no respect for me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife. \\n\\n 12:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 必 从 你 家 中 兴 起 祸 患 攻 击 你 。 我 必 在 你 眼 前 把 你 的 妃 嫔 赐 给 别 人 ， 他 在 日 光 之 下 就 与 她 们 同 寝 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. \\n\\n [bbe] The Lord says, From those of your family I will send evil against you, and before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to your neighbour, and he will take your wives to his bed by the light of this sun. \\n\\n 12:12 [hgb] 你 在 暗 中 行 这 事 ， 我 却 要 在 以 色 列 众 人 面 前 ， 日 光 之 下 ， 报 应 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun. \\n\\n [bbe] You did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel and in the light of the sun. \\n\\n 12:13 [hgb] 大 卫 对 拿 单 说 ， 我 得 罪 耶 和 华 了 。 拿 单 说 ， 耶 和 华 已 经 除 掉 你 的 罪 ， 你 必 不 至 于 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to Nathan, Great is my sin against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, The Lord has put away your sin; death will not come on you. \\n\\n 12:14 [hgb] 只 是 你 行 这 事 ， 叫 耶 和 华 的 仇 敌 大 得 亵 渎 的 机 会 ， 故 此 ， 你 所 得 的 孩 子 必 定 要 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. \\n\\n [bbe] But still, because you have had no respect for the Lord, death will certainly overtake the child who has newly come to birth. \\n\\n 12:15 [hgb] 拿 单 就 回 家 去 了 。 耶 和 华 击 打 乌 利 亚 妻 给 大 卫 所 生 的 孩 子 ， 使 他 得 重 病 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah\u0027s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Nathan went back to his house. And the hand of the Lord was on David\u0027s son, the child of Uriah\u0027s wife, and it became very ill. \\n\\n 12:16 [hgb] 所 以 大 卫 为 这 孩 子 恳 求 神 ， 而 且 禁 食 ， 进 入 内 室 ， 终 夜 躺 在 地 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. \\n\\n [bbe] So David made prayer to God for the child; and he took no food day after day, and went in and, stretching himself out on the earth, was there all night. \\n\\n 12:17 [hgb] 他 家 中 的 老 臣 来 到 他 旁 边 ， 要 把 他 从 地 上 扶 起 来 ， 他 却 不 肯 起 来 ， 也 不 同 他 们 吃 饭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. \\n\\n [bbe] And the chief men of his house got up and went to his side to make him get up from the earth, but he would not; and he would not take food with them. \\n\\n 12:18 [hgb] 到 第 七 日 ， 孩 子 死 了 。 大 卫 的 臣 仆 不 敢 告 诉 他 孩 子 死 了 ， 因 他 们 说 ， 孩 子 还 活 着 的 时 候 ， 我 们 劝 他 ， 他 尚 且 不 肯 听 我 们 的 话 ， 若 告 诉 他 孩 子 死 了 ， 岂 不 更 加 忧 伤 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? \\n\\n [bbe] And then on the seventh day the child\u0027s death took place. And David\u0027s servants were in fear of giving him the news of the child\u0027s death: for they said, Truly, while the child was still living he gave no attention when we said anything to him: what will he do to himself if we give him word that the child is dead? \\n\\n 12:19 [hgb] 大 卫 见 臣 仆 彼 此 低 声 说 话 ， 就 知 道 孩 子 死 了 ， 问 臣 仆 说 ， 孩 子 死 了 吗 ？ 他 们 说 ， 死 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. \\n\\n [bbe] But when David saw that his servants were talking together quietly, he was certain that the child was dead: and he said to his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is. \\n\\n 12:20 [hgb] 大 卫 就 从 地 上 起 来 ， 沐 浴 ， 抹 膏 ， 换 了 衣 裳 ， 进 耶 和 华 的 殿 敬 拜 。 然 后 回 宫 ， 吩 咐 人 摆 饭 ， 他 便 吃 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. \\n\\n [bbe] Then David got up from the earth, and after washing and rubbing himself with oil and changing his clothing, he went into the house of the Lord and gave worship: then he went back to his house, and at his order they put food before him and he had a meal. \\n\\n 12:21 [hgb] 臣 仆 问 他 说 ， 你 所 行 的 是 什 么 意 思 。 孩 子 活 着 的 时 候 ， 你 禁 食 哭 泣 。 孩 子 死 了 ， 你 倒 起 来 吃 饭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. \\n\\n [bbe] Then his servants said to him, Why have you been acting in this way? you were weeping and going without food while the child was still living; but when the child was dead, you got up and had a meal. \\n\\n 12:22 [hgb] 大 卫 说 ， 孩 子 还 活 着 ， 我 禁 食 哭 泣 。 因 为 我 想 ， 或 者 耶 和 华 怜 恤 我 ， 使 孩 子 不 死 也 未 可 知 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live? \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, While the child was still living I went without food and gave myself up to weeping: for I said, Who is able to say that the Lord will not have mercy on me and give the child life? \\n\\n 12:23 [hgb] 孩 子 死 了 ， 我 何 必 禁 食 ， 我 岂 能 使 他 返 回 呢 ？ 我 必 往 他 那 里 去 ， 他 却 不 能 回 我 这 里 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. \\n\\n [bbe] But now that the child is dead there is no reason for me to go without food; am I able to make him come back to life? I will go to him, but he will never come back to me. \\n\\n 12:24 [hgb] 大 卫 安 慰 他 的 妻 拔 示 巴 ， 与 她 同 寝 ， 她 就 生 了 儿 子 ， 给 他 起 名 叫 所 罗 门 。 耶 和 华 也 喜 爱 他 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him. \\n\\n [bbe] And David gave comfort to his wife Bath-sheba, and he went in to her and had connection with her: and she had a son to whom she gave the name Solomon. And he was dear to the Lord. \\n\\n 12:25 [hgb] 就 借 先 知 拿 单 赐 他 一 个 名 字 ， 叫 耶 底 底 亚 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 爱 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] And he sent word by Nathan the prophet, who gave him the name Jedidiah, by the word of the Lord. \\n\\n 12:26 [hgb] 约 押 攻 取 亚 扪 人 的 京 城 拉 巴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. \\n\\n [bbe] Now Joab was fighting against Rabbah, in the land of the children of Ammon, and he took the water-town. \\n\\n 12:27 [hgb] 约 押 打 发 使 者 去 见 大 卫 ， 说 ， 我 攻 打 拉 巴 ， 取 其 水 城 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. \\n\\n [bbe] And Joab sent men to David, saying, I have made war against Rabbah and have taken the water-town. \\n\\n 12:28 [hgb] 现 在 你 要 聚 集 其 余 的 军 兵 来 ， 安 营 围 攻 这 城 ， 恐 怕 我 取 了 这 城 ， 人 就 以 我 的 名 叫 这 城 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. \\n\\n [bbe] So now, get the rest of the people together, and put them in position against the town and take it, for if I take it, it will be named after my name. \\n\\n 12:29 [hgb] 于 是 大 卫 聚 集 众 军 ， 往 拉 巴 去 攻 城 ， 就 取 了 这 城 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. \\n\\n [bbe] Then David got all the people together and went to Rabbah and made war on it and took it. \\n\\n 12:30 [hgb] 夺 了 亚 扪 人 之 王 所 戴 的 金 冠 冕 （ 王 或 作 玛 勒 堪 。 玛 勒 堪 即 米 勒 公 ， 又 名 摩 洛 ， 亚 扪 族 之 神 名 ） ， 其 上 的 金 子 重 一 他 连 得 ， 又 嵌 着 宝 石 。 人 将 这 冠 冕 戴 在 大 卫 头 上 。 大 卫 从 城 里 夺 了 许 多 财 物 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he took their king\u0027s crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David\u0027s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance. \\n\\n [bbe] And he took the crown of Milcom from his head; the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it were stones of great price; and it was put on David\u0027s head. And he took a great store of goods from the town. \\n\\n 12:31 [hgb] 将 城 里 的 人 拉 出 来 ， 放 在 锯 下 ， 或 铁 耙 下 ， 或 铁 斧 下 ， 或 叫 他 经 过 砖 窑 （ 或 作 强 他 们 用 锯 ， 或 用 打 粮 食 的 铁 器 ， 或 用 铁 斧 作 工 ， 或 使 在 砖 窑 里 服 役 ） 。 大 卫 待 亚 扪 各 城 的 居 民 都 是 如 此 。 其 后 ， 大 卫 和 众 军 都 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem. \\n\\n [bbe] And he took the people out of the town and put them to work with wood-cutting instruments, and iron grain-crushers, and iron axes, and at brick-making: this he did to all the towns of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people went back to Jerusalem. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1487.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
