[bbe] And David had the people who were with him numbered, and he put over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds. 18:2 [hgb] 大 卫 打 发 军 兵 出 战 ， 分 为 三 队 ， 一 队 在 约 押 手 下 ， 一 队 在 洗 鲁 雅 的 儿 子 ， 约 押 兄 弟 亚 比 筛 手 下 ， 一 队 在 迦 特 人 以 太 手 下 。 大 卫 对 军 兵 说 ， 我 必 与 你 们 一 同 出 战 。 [kjv] And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab\u0027s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also. [bbe] And David sent the people out, a third of them under the orders of Joab, and a third under the orders of Abishai, son of Zeruiah, Joab\u0027s brother, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, And I myself will certainly go out with you. 18:3 [hgb] 军 兵 却 说 ， 你 不 可 出 战 。 若 是 我 们 逃 跑 ， 敌 人 必 不 介 意 。 我 们 阵 亡 一 半 ， 敌 人 也 不 介 意 。 因 为 你 一 人 强 似 我 们 万 人 ， 你 不 如 在 城 里 预 备 帮 助 我 们 。 [kjv] But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city. [bbe] But the people said, It is better for you not to go out: for if we are put to flight, they will not give a thought to us, and if death overtakes half of us, it will be nothing to them: but you are of more value than ten thousand of us: so it is better for you to be ready to come to our help from this town. 18:4 [hgb] 王 向 他 们 说 ， 你 们 以 为 怎 样 好 ， 我 就 怎 样 行 。 于 是 王 站 在 城 门 旁 ， 军 兵 或 百 或 千 地 挨 次 出 去 了 。 [kjv] And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. [bbe] And the king said to them, I will do whatever seems best to you. So the king took his place by the door of the town, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. 18:5 [hgb] 王 嘱 咐 约 押 ， 亚 比 筛 ， 以 太 说 ， 你 们 要 为 我 的 缘 故 宽 待 那 少 年 人 押 沙 龙 。 王 为 押 沙 龙 嘱 咐 众 将 的 话 ， 兵 都 听 见 了 。 [kjv] And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. [bbe] And the king gave orders to Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Because of me, be gentle to the young man Absalom. And this order about Absalom was given in the hearing of all the people. 18:6 [hgb] 兵 就 出 到 田 野 迎 着 以 色 列 人 ， 在 以 法 莲 树 林 里 交 战 。 [kjv] So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; [bbe] So the people went out into the field against Israel, and the fight took place in the woods of Ephraim. 18:7 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 败 在 大 卫 的 仆 人 面 前 。 那 日 阵 亡 的 甚 多 ， 共 有 二 万 人 。 [kjv] Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men. [bbe] And the people of Israel were overcome there by the servants of David, and there was a great destruction that day, and twenty thousand men were put to the sword. 18:8 [hgb] 因 为 在 那 里 四 面 打 仗 ， 死 于 树 林 的 比 死 于 刀 剑 的 更 多 。 [kjv] For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. [bbe] And the fighting went on over all the face of the country: and the woods were responsible for more deaths than the sword. 18:9 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 偶 然 遇 见 大 卫 的 仆 人 。 押 沙 龙 骑 着 骡 子 ， 从 大 橡 树 密 枝 底 下 经 过 ， 他 的 头 发 被 树 枝 绕 住 ， 就 悬 挂 起 来 ， 所 骑 的 骡 子 便 离 他 去 了 。 [kjv] And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away. [bbe] And Absalom came across some of David\u0027s men. And Absalom was seated on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great tree, and his head became fixed in the tree and he was lifted up between earth and heaven, and the beast under him went on. 18:10 [hgb] 有 个 人 看 见 ， 就 告 诉 约 押 说 ， 我 看 见 押 沙 龙 挂 在 橡 树 上 了 。 [kjv] And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. [bbe] And a certain man saw it and said to Joab, I saw Absalom hanging in a tree. 18:11 [hgb] 约 押 对 报 信 的 人 说 ， 你 既 看 见 他 ， 为 什 么 不 将 他 打 死 落 在 地 上 呢 ？ 你 若 打 死 他 ， 我 就 赏 你 十 舍 客 勒 银 子 ， 一 条 带 子 。 [kjv] And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle. [bbe] And Joab said to the man who had given him the news, If you saw this, why did you not put your sword through him, and I would have given you ten bits of silver and a band for your robe? 18:12 [hgb] 那 人 对 约 押 说 ， 我 就 是 得 你 一 千 舍 客 勒 银 子 ， 我 也 不 敢 伸 手 害 王 的 儿 子 。 因 为 我 们 听 见 王 嘱 咐 你 和 亚 比 筛 并 以 太 说 ， 你 们 要 谨 慎 ， 不 可 害 那 少 年 人 押 沙 龙 。 [kjv] And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king\u0027s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. [bbe] And the man said to Joab, Even if you gave me a thousand bits of silver, I would not put out my hand against the king\u0027s son: for in our hearing the king gave orders to you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care that the young man Absalom is not touched. 18:13 [hgb] 我 若 妄 为 害 了 他 的 性 命 ， 就 是 你 自 己 也 必 与 我 为 敌 。 原 来 无 论 何 事 都 瞒 不 过 王 。 [kjv] Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me. [bbe] And if I had falsely put him to death (and nothing may be kept secret from the king), you would have had nothing to do with me. 18:14 [hgb] 约 押 说 ， 我 不 能 与 你 留 连 。 约 押 手 拿 三 杆 短 枪 ， 趁 押 沙 龙 在 橡 树 上 还 活 着 ， 就 刺 透 他 的 心 。 [kjv] Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. [bbe] Then Joab said, I would have made it safe for you. And he took three spears in his hand, and put them through Absalom\u0027s heart, while he was still living, in the branches of the tree. 18:15 [hgb] 给 约 押 拿 兵 器 的 十 个 少 年 人 围 绕 押 沙 龙 ， 将 他 杀 死 。 [kjv] And ten young men that bare Joab\u0027s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. [bbe] And ten young men, servants of Joab, came round Absalom and put an end to him. 18:16 [hgb] 约 押 吹 角 ， 拦 阻 众 人 ， 他 们 就 回 来 ， 不 再 追 赶 以 色 列 人 。 [kjv] And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people. [bbe] And Joab had the horn sounded, and the people came back from going after Israel, for Joab kept them back. 18:17 [hgb] 他 们 将 押 沙 龙 丢 在 林 中 一 个 大 坑 里 ， 上 头 堆 起 一 大 堆 石 头 。 以 色 列 众 人 都 逃 跑 ， 各 回 各 家 去 了 。 [kjv] And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. [bbe] And they took Absalom\u0027s body and put it into a great hole in the wood, and put a great mass of stones over it: and every man of Israel went in flight to his tent. 18:18 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 活 着 的 时 候 ， 在 王 谷 立 了 一 根 石 柱 ， 因 他 说 ， 我 没 有 儿 子 为 我 留 名 。 他 就 以 自 己 的 名 称 那 石 柱 叫 押 沙 龙 柱 ， 直 到 今 日 。 [kjv] Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king\u0027s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom\u0027s place. [bbe] Now Absalom, before his death, had put up for himself a pillar in the king\u0027s valley, naming it after himself; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory: and to this day it is named Absalom\u0027s pillar. 18:19 [hgb] 撒 督 的 儿 子 亚 希 玛 斯 说 ， 容 我 跑 去 ， 将 耶 和 华 向 仇 敌 给 王 报 仇 的 信 息 报 与 王 知 。 [kjv] Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies. [bbe] Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said, Let me go and give the king news of how the Lord has done right in his cause against those who took up arms against him. 18:20 [hgb] 约 押 对 他 说 ， 你 今 日 不 可 去 报 信 ， 改 日 可 以 报 信 。 因 为 今 日 王 的 儿 子 死 了 ， 所 以 你 不 可 去 报 信 。 [kjv] And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king\u0027s son is dead. [bbe] And Joab said, You will take no news today; another day you may give him the news, but you will take no news today, because the king\u0027s son is dead. 18:21 [hgb] 约 押 对 古 示 人 说 ， 你 去 将 你 所 看 见 的 告 诉 王 。 古 示 人 在 约 押 面 前 下 拜 ， 就 跑 去 了 。 [kjv] Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. [bbe] Then Joab said to the Cushite, Go and give the king word of what you have seen. And the Cushite, making a sign of respect to Joab, went off running. 18:22 [hgb] 撒 督 的 儿 子 亚 希 玛 斯 又 对 约 押 说 ， 无 论 怎 样 ， 求 你 容 我 随 着 古 示 人 跑 去 。 约 押 说 ， 我 儿 ， 你 报 这 信 息 ， 既 不 得 赏 赐 ， 何 必 要 跑 去 呢 ？ [kjv] Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? [bbe] Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said to Joab again, Whatever may come of it, let me go after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why have you a desire to go, my son, seeing that you will get no reward for your news? 18:23 [hgb] 他 又 说 ， 无 论 怎 样 ， 我 要 跑 去 。 约 押 说 ， 你 跑 去 吧 。 亚 希 玛 斯 就 从 平 原 往 前 跑 ， 跑 过 古 示 人 去 了 。 [kjv] But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi. [bbe] Whatever may come of it, he said, I will go. Then he said to him, Go. So Ahimaaz went running by the lowland road and overtook the Cushite. 18:24 [hgb] 大 卫 正 坐 在 城 瓮 里 。 守 望 的 人 上 城 门 楼 的 顶 上 ， 举 目 观 看 ， 见 有 一 个 人 独 自 跑 来 。 [kjv] And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. [bbe] Now David was seated between the two town doors; and the watchman went up to the roof of the doorways, on the wall, and, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running by himself. 18:25 [hgb] 守 望 的 人 就 大 声 告 诉 王 。 王 说 ， 他 若 独 自 来 ， 必 是 报 口 信 的 。 那 人 跑 得 渐 渐 近 了 。 [kjv] And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near. [bbe] And the watchman gave news of it to the king. And the king said, If he is coming by himself, then he has news. And the man was travelling quickly, and came near. 18:26 [hgb] 守 望 的 人 又 见 一 人 跑 来 ， 就 对 守 城 门 的 人 说 ， 又 有 一 人 独 自 跑 来 。 王 说 ， 这 也 必 是 报 信 的 。 [kjv] And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. [bbe] Then the watchman saw another man running: and crying out in the direction of the door he said, Here is another man running by himself. And the king said, He, like the other, comes with news. 18:27 [hgb] 守 望 的 人 说 ， 我 看 前 头 人 的 跑 法 ， 好 像 撒 督 的 儿 子 亚 希 玛 斯 的 跑 法 一 样 。 王 说 ， 他 是 个 好 人 ， 必 是 报 好 信 息 。 [kjv] And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings. [bbe] And the watchman said, It seems to me that the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and his news will be good. 18:28 [hgb] 亚 希 玛 斯 向 王 呼 叫 说 ， 平 安 了 。 就 在 王 面 前 脸 伏 于 地 叩 拜 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 你 的 神 是 应 当 称 颂 的 ， 因 他 已 将 那 举 手 攻 击 我 主 我 王 的 人 交 给 王 了 。 [kjv] And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. [bbe] And Ahimaaz, crying out to the king, said, It is well. And falling down before the king, with his face to the earth, he said, May the Lord your God be praised, who has given up the men who took up arms against my lord the king! 18:29 [hgb] 王 问 说 ， 少 年 人 押 沙 龙 平 安 不 平 安 。 亚 希 玛 斯 回 答 说 ， 约 押 打 发 王 的 仆 人 ， 那 时 仆 人 听 见 众 民 大 声 喧 哗 ， 却 不 知 道 是 什 么 事 。 [kjv] And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king\u0027s servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. [bbe] And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz said in answer, When Joab sent me, your servant, I saw a great outcry going on, but I had no knowledge of what it was. 18:30 [hgb] 王 说 ， 你 退 去 ， 站 在 旁 边 。 他 就 退 去 ， 站 在 旁 边 。 [kjv] And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still. [bbe] And the king said, Get back and take your place here. So turning to one side, he took his place there. 18:31 [hgb] 古 示 人 也 来 到 ， 说 ， 有 信 息 报 给 我 主 我 王 。 耶 和 华 今 日 向 一 切 兴 起 攻 击 你 的 人 给 你 报 仇 了 。 [kjv] And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee. [bbe] And then the Cushite came and said, I have news for my lord the king: today the Lord has done right in your cause against all those who took up arms against you. 18:32 [hgb] 王 问 古 示 人 说 ， 少 年 人 押 沙 龙 平 安 不 平 安 。 古 示 人 回 答 说 ， 愿 我 主 我 王 的 仇 敌 ， 和 一 切 兴 起 要 杀 害 你 的 人 ， 都 与 那 少 年 人 一 样 。 [kjv] And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is. [bbe] And the king said to the Cushite, Is the young man Absalom safe? And the Cushite said in answer, May all the king\u0027s haters and those who do evil against the king, be as that young man is! 18:33 [hgb] 王 就 心 里 伤 恸 ， 上 城 门 楼 去 哀 哭 ， 一 面 走 一 面 说 ， 我 儿 押 沙 龙 阿 。 我 儿 ， 我 儿 押 沙 龙 阿 。 我 恨 不 得 替 你 死 ， 押 沙 龙 阿 ， 我 儿 。 我 儿 。 [kjv] And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! [bbe] Then the king was much moved, and went up into the room over the door, weeping, and saying, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! if only my life might have been given for yours, O Absalom, my son, my son!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1493.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
