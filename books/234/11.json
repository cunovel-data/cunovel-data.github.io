But David tarried still at Jerusalem. \n [bbe] Now in the spring, at the time when kings go out to war, David sent Joab and his servants and all Israel with him; and they made waste the land of the children of Ammon, and took up their position before Rabbah, shutting it in. But David was still at Jerusalem. \n 11:2 [hgb] 一 日 ， 太 阳 平 西 ， 大 卫 从 床 上 起 来 ， 在 王 宫 的 平 顶 上 游 行 ， 看 见 一 个 妇 人 沐 浴 ， 容 貌 甚 美 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king\u0027s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. \n [bbe] Now one evening, David got up from his bed, and while he was walking on the roof of the king\u0027s house, he saw from there a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful. \n 11:3 [hgb] 大 卫 就 差 人 打 听 那 妇 人 是 谁 。 有 人 说 ， 她 是 以 连 的 女 儿 ， 赫 人 乌 利 亚 的 妻 拔 示 巴 。 \n [kjv] And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? \n [bbe] And David sent to get knowledge who the woman was. And one said, Is this not Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite? \n 11:4 [hgb] 大 卫 差 人 去 ， 将 妇 人 接 来 。 那 时 她 的 月 经 才 得 洁 净 。 她 来 了 ， 大 卫 与 她 同 房 ， 她 就 回 家 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house. \n [bbe] And David sent and took her; and she came to him, and he took her to his bed: (for she had been made clean;) then she went back to her house. \n 11:5 [hgb] 于 是 她 怀 了 孕 ， 打 发 人 去 告 诉 大 卫 说 ， 我 怀 了 孕 。 \n [kjv] And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child. \n [bbe] And the woman became with child; and she sent word to David that she was with child. \n 11:6 [hgb] 大 卫 差 人 到 约 押 那 里 ， 说 ， 你 打 发 赫 人 乌 利 亚 到 我 这 里 来 。 约 押 就 打 发 乌 利 亚 去 见 大 卫 。 \n [kjv] And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David. \n [bbe] And David sent to Joab saying, Send Uriah the Hittite to me. And Joab sent Uriah to David. \n 11:7 [hgb] 乌 利 亚 来 了 ， 大 卫 问 约 押 好 ， 也 问 兵 好 ， 又 问 争 战 的 事 怎 样 。 \n [kjv] And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered. \n [bbe] And when Uriah came to him, David put questions to him about how Joab and the people were, and how the war was going. \n 11:8 [hgb] 大 卫 对 乌 利 亚 说 ， 你 回 家 去 ， 洗 洗 脚 吧 。 乌 利 亚 出 了 王 宫 ， 随 后 王 送 他 一 分 食 物 。 \n [kjv] And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king\u0027s house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king. \n [bbe] And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house and let your feet be washed. And Uriah went away from the king\u0027s house, and an offering from the king was sent after him. \n 11:9 [hgb] 乌 利 亚 却 和 他 主 人 的 仆 人 一 同 睡 在 宫 门 外 ， 没 有 回 家 去 。 \n [kjv] But Uriah slept at the door of the king\u0027s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. \n [bbe] But Uriah took his rest at the door of the king\u0027s house, with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. \n 11:10 [hgb] 有 人 告 诉 大 卫 说 ， 乌 利 亚 没 有 回 家 去 。 大 卫 就 问 乌 利 亚 说 ， 你 从 远 路 上 来 ， 为 什 么 不 回 家 去 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house? \n [bbe] And when word was given to David that Uriah had not gone down to his house, David said to Uriah, Have you not come from a journey? why did you not go down to your house? \n 11:11 [hgb] 乌 利 亚 对 大 卫 说 ， 约 柜 和 以 色 列 与 犹 大 兵 都 住 在 棚 里 ， 我 主 约 押 和 我 主 （ 或 作 王 ） 的 仆 人 都 在 田 野 安 营 ， 我 岂 可 回 家 吃 喝 ， 与 妻 子 同 寝 呢 ？ 我 敢 在 王 面 前 起 誓 （ 原 文 作 我 指 着 王 和 王 的 性 命 起 誓 ） ， 我 决 不 行 这 事 。 \n [kjv] And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing. \n [bbe] And Uriah said to David, Israel and Judah with the ark are living in tents, and my lord Joab and the other servants of my lord are sleeping in the open field; and am I to go to my house and take food and drink, and go to bed with my wife? By the living Lord, and by the life of your soul, I will not do such a thing. \n 11:12 [hgb] 大 卫 吩 咐 乌 利 亚 说 ， 你 今 日 仍 住 在 这 里 ， 明 日 我 打 发 你 去 。 于 是 乌 利 亚 那 日 和 次 日 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 。 \n [kjv] And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow. \n [bbe] And David said to Uriah, Be here today, and after that I will let you go. So Uriah was in Jerusalem that day and the day after. \n 11:13 [hgb] 大 卫 召 了 乌 利 亚 来 ， 叫 他 在 自 己 面 前 吃 喝 ， 使 他 喝 醉 。 到 了 晚 上 ， 乌 利 亚 出 去 与 他 主 的 仆 人 一 同 住 宿 ， 还 没 有 回 到 家 里 去 。 \n [kjv] And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house. \n [bbe] And when David sent for him, he took meat and drink with him, and David made him the worse for drink: and when evening came, he went to rest on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house. \n 11:14 [hgb] 次 日 早 晨 ， 大 卫 写 信 与 约 押 ， 交 乌 利 亚 随 手 带 去 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. \n [bbe] Now in the morning, David gave Uriah a letter to take to Joab. \n 11:15 [hgb] 信 内 写 着 说 ， 要 派 乌 利 亚 前 进 ， 到 阵 势 极 险 之 处 ， 你 们 便 退 后 ， 使 他 被 杀 。 \n [kjv] And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die. \n [bbe] And in the letter he said, Take care to put Uriah in the very front of the line, where the fighting is most violent, and go back from him, so that he may be overcome and put to death. \n 11:16 [hgb] 约 押 围 城 的 时 候 ， 知 道 敌 人 那 里 有 勇 士 ， 便 将 乌 利 亚 派 在 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were. \n [bbe] So while Joab was watching the town, he put Uriah in the place where it was clear to him the best fighters were. \n 11:17 [hgb] 城 里 的 人 出 来 和 约 押 打 仗 。 大 卫 的 仆 人 中 有 几 个 被 杀 的 ， 赫 人 乌 利 亚 也 死 了 。 \n [kjv] And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. \n [bbe] And the men of the town went out and had a fight with Joab: and a number of David\u0027s men came to their death in the fight, and with them Uriah the Hittite. \n 11:18 [hgb] 于 是 ， 约 押 差 人 去 将 争 战 的 一 切 事 告 诉 大 卫 ， \n [kjv] Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; \n [bbe] Then Joab sent David news of everything which had taken place in the war: \n 11:19 [hgb] 又 嘱 咐 使 者 说 ， 你 把 争 战 的 一 切 事 对 王 说 完 了 ， \n [kjv] And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king, \n [bbe] And he gave orders to the man who took the news, saying, After you have given the king all the news about the war, \n 11:20 [hgb] 王 若 发 怒 ， 问 你 说 ， 你 们 打 仗 为 什 么 挨 近 城 墙 呢 ？ 岂 不 知 敌 人 必 从 城 上 射 箭 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And if so be that the king\u0027s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? \n [bbe] If the king is angry and says, Why did you go so near the town for the fight? was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall? \n 11:21 [hgb] 从 前 打 死 耶 路 比 设 （ 就 是 耶 路 巴 力 ， 见 士 师 记 九 章 一 节 ） 儿 子 亚 比 米 勒 的 是 谁 呢 ？ 岂 不 是 一 个 妇 人 从 城 上 抛 下 一 块 上 磨 石 来 ， 打 在 他 身 上 ， 他 就 死 在 提 备 斯 吗 ？ 你 们 为 什 么 挨 近 城 墙 呢 ？ 你 就 说 ， 王 的 仆 人 ， 赫 人 乌 利 亚 也 死 了 。 \n [kjv] Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. \n [bbe] Who put Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, to death? did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall, putting him to death at Thebez? why did you go so near the wall? Then say to him, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is among the dead. \n 11:22 [hgb] 使 者 起 身 ， 来 见 大 卫 ， 照 着 约 押 所 吩 咐 他 的 话 奏 告 大 卫 。 \n [kjv] So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for. \n [bbe] So the man went, and came to David, and gave him all the news which Joab had sent him to give; then David was angry with Joab and said, Why did you go so near the town for the fight? was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall? who put Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, to death? did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall, putting him to death at Thebez? why did you go so near the wall? \n 11:23 [hgb] 使 者 对 大 卫 说 ， 敌 人 强 过 我 们 ， 出 到 郊 野 与 我 们 打 仗 ， 我 们 追 杀 他 们 ， 直 到 城 门 口 。 \n [kjv] And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate. \n [bbe] And the man said to David, Truly the men got the better of us, and came out against us into the open country, but we sent them back to the very doors of the town. \n 11:24 [hgb] 射 箭 的 从 城 上 射 王 的 仆 人 ， 射 死 几 个 ， 赫 人 乌 利 亚 也 死 了 。 \n [kjv] And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king\u0027s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. \n [bbe] And the archers sent their arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king\u0027s servants are dead, and among them is your servant Uriah the Hittite. \n 11:25 [hgb] 王 向 使 者 说 ， 你 告 诉 约 押 说 ， 不 要 因 这 事 愁 闷 ， 刀 剑 或 吞 灭 这 人 或 吞 灭 那 人 ， 没 有 一 定 的 。 你 只 管 竭 力 攻 城 ， 将 城 倾 覆 。 可 以 用 这 话 勉 励 约 押 。 \n [kjv] Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him. \n [bbe] Then David said to the man, Go and say to Joab, Do not let this be a grief to you; for one man may come to his death by the sword like another: put up an even stronger fight against the town, and take it: and do you put heart into him. \n 11:26 [hgb] 乌 利 亚 的 妻 听 见 丈 夫 乌 利 亚 死 了 ， 就 为 他 哀 哭 。 \n [kjv] And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. \n [bbe] And when the wife of Uriah had news that her husband was dead, she gave herself up to weeping for him. \n 11:27 [hgb] 哀 哭 的 日 子 过 了 ， 大 卫 差 人 将 她 接 到 宫 里 ， 她 就 作 了 大 卫 的 妻 ， 给 大 卫 生 了 一 个 儿 子 。 但 大 卫 所 行 的 这 事 ， 耶 和 华 甚 不 喜 悦 。 \n [kjv] And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD. \n [bbe] And when the days of weeping were past, David sent for her, and took her into his house, and she became his wife and gave him a son. But the Lord was not pleased with the thing David had done. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1486.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
