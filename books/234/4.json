[bbe] And when Saul\u0027s son Ish-bosheth had news that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. 4:2 [hgb] 扫 罗 的 儿 子 伊 施 波 设 有 两 个 军 长 ， 一 名 巴 拿 ， 一 名 利 甲 ， 是 便 雅 悯 支 派 ， 比 录 人 临 门 的 儿 子 。 比 录 也 属 便 雅 悯 。 [kjv] And Saul\u0027s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin. [bbe] And Saul\u0027s son had two men, captains of bands, one named Baanah and the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin; (for Beeroth was at one time taken to be part of Benjamin: 4:3 [hgb] 比 录 人 早 先 逃 到 基 他 音 ， 在 那 里 寄 居 ， 直 到 今 日 。 [kjv] And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.) [bbe] But the people of Beeroth had gone in flight to Gittaim, where they have been living to this day.) 4:4 [hgb] 扫 罗 的 儿 子 约 拿 单 有 一 个 儿 子 名 叫 米 非 波 设 ， 是 瘸 腿 的 。 扫 罗 和 约 拿 单 死 亡 的 消 息 从 耶 斯 列 传 到 的 时 候 ， 他 才 五 岁 。 他 乳 母 抱 着 他 逃 跑 。 因 为 跑 得 太 急 ， 孩 子 掉 在 地 上 ， 腿 就 瘸 了 。 [kjv] And Jonathan, Saul\u0027s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth. [bbe] Now Jonathan, Saul\u0027s son, had a son whose feet were damaged. He was five years old when news of the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and the woman who took care of him took him up and went in flight: and while she was getting him away as quickly as she was able, he had a fall and his feet were damaged. His name was Mephibosheth. 4:5 [hgb] 一 日 ， 比 录 人 临 门 的 两 个 儿 子 利 甲 和 巴 拿 出 去 ， 约 在 午 热 的 时 候 到 了 伊 施 波 设 的 家 。 伊 施 波 设 正 睡 午 觉 。 [kjv] And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon. [bbe] And Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, went out and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, when he was resting in the middle of the day. Now the woman who kept the door was cleaning grain, and sleep overcame her. 4:6 [hgb] 他 们 进 了 房 子 ， 假 作 要 取 麦 子 ， 就 刺 透 伊 施 波 设 的 肚 腹 ， 逃 跑 了 。 [kjv] And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. [bbe] And Rechab and his brother Baanah got in without being seen. 4:7 [hgb] 他 们 进 房 子 的 时 候 ， 伊 施 波 设 正 在 卧 房 里 躺 在 床 上 ， 他 们 将 他 杀 死 ， 割 了 他 的 首 级 ， 拿 着 首 级 在 亚 拉 巴 走 了 一 夜 ， [kjv] For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night. [bbe] And when they came into the house, Ish-bosheth was stretched on his bed in his bedroom; and they made an attack on him and put him to death, and, cutting off his head, they took it with them and went by the road through the Arabah all night. 4:8 [hgb] 将 伊 施 波 设 的 首 级 拿 到 希 伯 仑 见 大 卫 王 ， 说 ， 王 的 仇 敌 扫 罗 曾 寻 索 王 的 性 命 。 看 哪 ， 这 是 他 儿 子 伊 施 波 设 的 首 级 。 耶 和 华 今 日 为 我 主 我 王 在 扫 罗 和 他 后 裔 的 身 上 报 了 仇 。 [kjv] And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed. [bbe] And they took the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron, and said to the king, Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul your hater, who would have taken your life; the Lord has taken payment for the wrongs of my lord the king from Saul and his seed today. 4:9 [hgb] 大 卫 对 比 录 人 临 门 的 儿 子 利 甲 和 他 兄 弟 巴 拿 说 ， 我 指 着 救 我 性 命 脱 离 一 切 苦 难 ， 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， [kjv] And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, [bbe] And David made answer to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, By the living Lord, who has kept me safe from all my trouble, 4:10 [hgb] 从 前 有 人 报 告 我 说 ， 扫 罗 死 了 ， 他 自 以 为 报 好 消 息 。 我 就 拿 住 他 ， 将 他 杀 在 洗 革 拉 ， 这 就 作 了 他 报 消 息 的 赏 赐 。 [kjv] When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings: [bbe] When one came to me with the news of Saul\u0027s death, in the belief that it would be good news, I took him and put him to death in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news: 4:11 [hgb] 何 况 恶 人 将 义 人 杀 在 他 的 床 上 ， 我 岂 不 向 你 们 讨 流 他 血 的 罪 ， 从 世 上 除 灭 你 们 呢 ？ [kjv] How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? [bbe] How much more, when evil men have put an upright person to death, in his house, sleeping on his bed, will I take payment from you for his blood, and have you cut off from the earth? 4:12 [hgb] 于 是 大 卫 吩 咐 少 年 人 将 他 们 杀 了 ， 砍 断 他 们 的 手 脚 ， 挂 在 希 伯 仑 的 池 旁 ， 却 将 伊 施 波 设 的 首 级 葬 在 希 伯 仑 押 尼 珥 的 坟 墓 里 。 [kjv] And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron. [bbe] And David gave orders to his young men and they put them to death, cutting off their hands and their feet and hanging them up by the side of the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and put it in its last resting-place with Abner\u0027s body in Hebron.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1479.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
