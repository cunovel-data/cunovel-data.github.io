So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness. \n [bbe] And they said to King David, The blessing of the Lord is on the family of Obed-edom and on all he has, because of the ark of God. And David went and took the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the town of David with joy. \n 6:13 [hgb] 抬 耶 和 华 约 柜 的 人 走 了 六 步 ， 大 卫 就 献 牛 与 肥 羊 为 祭 。 \n [kjv] And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. \n [bbe] And when those who were lifting the ark of the Lord had gone six steps, he made an offering of an ox and a fat young beast. \n 6:14 [hgb] 大 卫 穿 着 细 麻 布 的 以 弗 得 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 极 力 跳 舞 。 \n [kjv] And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. \n [bbe] And David, clothed in a linen ephod, was dancing before the Lord with all his strength. \n 6:15 [hgb] 这 样 ， 大 卫 和 以 色 列 的 全 家 欢 呼 吹 角 ， 将 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 抬 上 来 。 \n [kjv] So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. \n [bbe] So David and all the men of Israel took up the ark of the Lord with cries of joy and sounding of horns. \n 6:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 进 了 大 卫 城 的 时 候 ， 扫 罗 的 女 儿 米 甲 从 窗 户 里 观 看 ， 见 大 卫 王 在 耶 和 华 面 前 踊 跃 跳 舞 ， 心 里 就 轻 视 他 。 \n [kjv] And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul\u0027s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. \n [bbe] And when the ark of the Lord came into the town of David, Michal, Saul\u0027s daughter, looking out of the window, saw King David dancing and jumping before the Lord; and to her mind he seemed foolish. \n 6:17 [hgb] 众 人 将 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 请 进 去 ， 安 放 在 所 预 备 的 地 方 ， 就 是 在 大 卫 所 搭 的 帐 幕 里 。 大 卫 在 耶 和 华 面 前 献 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 。 \n [kjv] And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. \n [bbe] And they took in the ark of the Lord, and put it in its place inside the tent which David had put up for it: and David made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord. \n 6:18 [hgb] 大 卫 献 完 了 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 ， 就 奉 万 军 之 耶 和 华 的 名 给 民 祝 福 ， \n [kjv] And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. \n [bbe] And after David had made the burned offerings and the peace-offerings, he gave the people a blessing in the name of the Lord of armies. \n 6:19 [hgb] 并 且 分 给 以 色 列 众 人 ， 无 论 男 女 ， 每 人 一 个 饼 ， 一 块 肉 ， 一 个 葡 萄 饼 。 众 人 就 各 回 各 家 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house. \n [bbe] And he gave to every man and woman among all the people, among all the masses of Israel, a cake of bread and a measure of wine and a cake of dry grapes. Then all the people went away, every man to his house. \n 6:20 [hgb] 大 卫 回 家 要 给 眷 属 祝 福 。 扫 罗 的 女 儿 米 甲 出 来 迎 接 他 ， 说 ， 以 色 列 王 今 日 在 臣 仆 的 婢 女 眼 前 露 体 ， 如 同 一 个 轻 贱 人 无 耻 露 体 一 样 ， 有 好 大 的 荣 耀 阿 。 \n [kjv] Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! \n [bbe] Then David came back to give a blessing to his family. And Michal, Saul\u0027s daughter, came out to him and said, How full of glory was the king of Israel today, who let himself be seen uncovered by his servant-girls like a foolish person uncovering himself without shame! \n 6:21 [hgb] 大 卫 对 米 甲 说 ， 这 是 在 耶 和 华 面 前 。 耶 和 华 已 拣 选 我 ， 废 了 你 父 和 你 父 的 全 家 ， 立 我 作 耶 和 华 民 以 色 列 的 君 ， 所 以 我 必 在 耶 和 华 面 前 跳 舞 。 \n [kjv] And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD. \n [bbe] And David said to Michal, I was dancing before the Lord, who put me over your father and all his sons, to make me a ruler over the people of the Lord, over his people Israel: and I will go on playing before the Lord; \n 6:22 [hgb] 我 也 必 更 加 卑 微 ， 自 己 看 为 轻 贱 。 你 所 说 的 那 些 婢 女 ， 她 们 倒 要 尊 敬 我 。 \n [kjv] And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour. \n [bbe] And I will do even worse than this, and make myself even lower in your eyes: but the servant-girls of whom you were talking will give me honour. \n 6:23 [hgb] 扫 罗 的 女 儿 米 甲 ， 直 到 死 日 ， 没 有 生 养 儿 女 。 \n [kjv] Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death. \n [bbe] And Michal, Saul\u0027s daughter, had no child till the day of her death. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1481.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
