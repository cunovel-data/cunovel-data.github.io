Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house. \n [bbe] And that day David said, Whoever makes an attack on the Jebusites, let him go up by the water-pipe, and put to death all the blind and feeble-footed who are hated by David. And this is why they say, The blind and feeble-footed may not come into the house. \n 5:9 [hgb] 大 卫 住 在 保 障 里 ， 给 保 障 起 名 叫 大 卫 城 。 大 卫 又 从 米 罗 以 里 ， 周 围 筑 墙 。 \n [kjv] So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. \n [bbe] So David took the strong tower for his living-place, naming it the town of David. And David took in hand the building of the town all round, starting from the Millo. \n 5:10 [hgb] 大 卫 日 见 强 盛 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 万 军 之 神 与 他 同 在 。 \n [kjv] And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him. \n [bbe] And David became greater and greater; for the Lord, the God of armies, was with him. \n 5:11 [hgb] 推 罗 王 希 兰 将 香 柏 木 运 到 大 卫 那 里 ， 又 差 遣 使 者 和 木 匠 ， 石 匠 给 大 卫 建 造 宫 殿 。 \n [kjv] And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house. \n [bbe] And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent men to David, with cedar-trees and woodworkers and stoneworkers: and they made David a house. \n 5:12 [hgb] 大 卫 就 知 道 耶 和 华 坚 立 他 作 以 色 列 王 ， 又 为 自 己 的 民 以 色 列 使 他 的 国 兴 旺 。 \n [kjv] And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel\u0027s sake. \n [bbe] And David saw that the Lord had made his position safe as king over Israel, and that he had made his kingdom great because of his people Israel. \n 5:13 [hgb] 大 卫 离 开 希 伯 仑 之 后 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 又 立 后 妃 ， 又 生 儿 女 。 \n [kjv] And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. \n [bbe] And David took more women and wives in Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron: and he had more sons and daughters. \n 5:14 [hgb] 在 耶 路 撒 冷 所 生 的 儿 子 是 沙 母 亚 ， 朔 罢 ， 拿 单 ， 所 罗 门 ， \n [kjv] And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, \n [bbe] These are the names of those whose birth took place in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon \n 5:15 [hgb] 益 辖 ， 以 利 书 亚 ， 尼 斐 ， 雅 非 亚 ， \n [kjv] Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, \n [bbe] And Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia \n 5:16 [hgb] 以 利 沙 玛 ， 以 利 雅 大 ， 以 利 法 列 。 \n [kjv] And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet. \n [bbe] And Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet. \n 5:17 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 听 见 人 膏 大 卫 作 以 色 列 王 ， 非 利 士 众 人 就 上 来 寻 索 大 卫 。 大 卫 听 见 ， 就 下 到 保 障 。 \n [kjv] But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold. \n [bbe] And when the Philistines had news that David had been made king over Israel, they all went up in search of David; and David, hearing of it, went down to the strong place. \n 5:18 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 来 了 ， 布 散 在 利 乏 音 谷 。 \n [kjv] The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. \n [bbe] And when the Philistines came, they went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim. \n 5:19 [hgb] 大 卫 求 问 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 可 以 上 去 攻 打 非 利 士 人 吗 ？ 你 将 他 们 交 在 我 手 里 吗 ？ 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 可 以 上 去 ， 我 必 将 非 利 士 人 交 在 你 手 里 。 \n [kjv] And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand. \n [bbe] And David, desiring directions from the Lord, said, Am I to go up against the Philistines? will you give them up into my hands? And the Lord said, Go up, for I will certainly give up the Philistines into your hands. \n 5:20 [hgb] 大 卫 来 到 巴 力 毗 拉 心 ， 在 那 里 击 杀 非 利 士 人 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 在 我 面 前 冲 破 敌 人 ， 如 同 水 冲 去 一 般 。 因 此 称 那 地 方 为 巴 力 毗 拉 心 。 \n [kjv] And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim. \n [bbe] And David went to Baal-perazim, and overcame them there; and he said, The Lord has let the forces fighting against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters. So that place was named Baal-perazim. \n 5:21 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 将 偶 像 撇 在 那 里 ， 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 拿 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them. \n [bbe] And the Philistines, when they went in flight, did not take their images with them, and David and his men took them away. \n 5:22 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 又 上 来 ， 布 散 在 利 乏 音 谷 。 \n [kjv] And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. \n [bbe] And the Philistines came up again, and went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim. \n 5:23 [hgb] 大 卫 求 问 耶 和 华 。 耶 和 华 说 ， 不 要 一 直 地 上 去 ， 要 转 到 他 们 后 头 ， 从 桑 林 对 面 攻 打 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. \n [bbe] And when David went for directions to the Lord, he said, You are not to go up against them in front; but make a circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the spice-trees. \n 5:24 [hgb] 你 听 见 桑 树 梢 上 有 脚 步 的 声 音 ， 就 要 急 速 前 去 ， 因 为 那 时 耶 和 华 已 经 在 你 前 头 去 攻 打 非 利 士 人 的 军 队 。 \n [kjv] And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines. \n [bbe] Then at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees, go forward quickly, for the Lord has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines. \n 5:25 [hgb] 大 卫 就 遵 着 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 去 行 ， 攻 打 非 利 士 人 ， 从 迦 巴 直 到 基 色 。 \n [kjv] And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer. \n [bbe] And David did as the Lord had said; and he overcame the Philistines, attacking them from Gibeon to near Gezer. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1480.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
