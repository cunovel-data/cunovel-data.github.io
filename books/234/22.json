[bbe] My God, my Rock, in him will I put my faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my safe place; my saviour, who keeps me safe from the violent man. 22:4 [hgb] 我 要 求 告 当 赞 美 的 耶 和 华 ， 这 样 ， 我 必 从 仇 敌 手 中 被 救 出 来 。 [kjv] I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. [bbe] I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me. 22:5 [hgb] 曾 有 死 亡 的 波 浪 环 绕 我 ， 匪 类 的 急 流 使 我 惊 惧 ， [kjv] When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; [bbe] For the waves of death came round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear; 22:6 [hgb] 阴 间 的 绳 索 缠 绕 我 ， 死 亡 的 网 罗 临 到 我 。 [kjv] The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me; [bbe] The cords of hell were round me: the nets of death came on me. 22:7 [hgb] 我 在 急 难 中 求 告 耶 和 华 ， 向 我 的 神 呼 求 。 他 从 殿 中 听 了 我 的 声 音 。 我 的 呼 求 入 了 他 的 耳 中 。 [kjv] In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears. [bbe] In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came to his ears. 22:8 [hgb] 那 时 因 他 发 怒 ， 地 就 摇 撼 战 抖 。 天 的 根 基 也 震 动 摇 撼 。 [kjv] Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth. [bbe] Then the earth was moved with a violent shock; the bases of heaven were moved and shaking, because he was angry. 22:9 [hgb] 从 他 鼻 孔 冒 烟 上 腾 。 从 他 口 中 发 火 焚 烧 ， 连 炭 也 着 了 。 [kjv] There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. [bbe] There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth: coals were lighted by it. 22:10 [hgb] 他 又 使 天 下 垂 ， 亲 自 降 临 。 有 黑 云 在 他 脚 下 。 [kjv] He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet. [bbe] The heavens were bent, so that he might come down; and it was dark under his feet. 22:11 [hgb] 他 坐 着 基 路 伯 飞 行 ， 在 风 的 翅 膀 上 显 现 。 [kjv] And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind. [bbe] And he went through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind. 22:12 [hgb] 他 以 黑 暗 和 聚 集 的 水 ， 天 空 的 厚 云 为 他 四 围 的 行 宫 。 [kjv] And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies. [bbe] And he made the dark his tent round him, a mass of waters, thick clouds of the skies. 22:13 [hgb] 因 他 面 前 的 光 辉 炭 都 着 了 。 [kjv] Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled. [bbe] Before his shining light his dark clouds went past, raining ice and coals of fire. 22:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 从 天 上 打 雷 。 至 高 者 发 出 声 音 。 [kjv] The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice. [bbe] The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding out. 22:15 [hgb] 他 射 出 箭 来 ， 使 仇 敌 四 散 ， 发 出 闪 电 ， 使 他 们 扰 乱 。 [kjv] And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them. [bbe] And he sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled. 22:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 斥 责 一 发 ， 鼻 孔 的 气 一 出 ， 海 底 就 出 现 ， 大 地 的 根 基 也 显 露 。 [kjv] And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. [bbe] Then the deep beds of the sea were seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of the Lord\u0027s wrath, because of the breath of his mouth. 22:17 [hgb] 他 从 高 天 伸 手 抓 住 我 ， 把 我 从 大 水 中 拉 上 来 。 [kjv] He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; [bbe] He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters. 22:18 [hgb] 他 救 我 脱 离 我 的 劲 敌 和 那 些 恨 我 的 人 ， 因 为 他 们 比 我 强 盛 。 [kjv] He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me. [bbe] He made me free from my strong hater, from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I. 22:19 [hgb] 我 遭 遇 灾 难 的 日 子 ， 他 们 来 攻 击 我 。 但 耶 和 华 是 我 的 倚 靠 。 [kjv] They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. [bbe] They came on me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my support. 22:20 [hgb] 他 又 领 我 到 宽 阔 之 处 。 他 救 拔 我 ， 因 他 喜 悦 我 。 [kjv] He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me. [bbe] He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in me. 22:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 按 着 我 的 公 义 报 答 我 ， 按 着 我 手 中 的 清 洁 赏 赐 我 。 [kjv] The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. [bbe] The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean before him. 22:22 [hgb] 因 为 我 遵 守 了 耶 和 华 的 道 ， 未 曾 作 恶 离 开 我 的 神 。 [kjv] For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. [bbe] For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not been turned away in sin from my God. 22:23 [hgb] 他 的 一 切 典 章 常 在 我 面 前 。 他 的 律 例 ， 我 也 未 曾 离 弃 。 [kjv] For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them. [bbe] For all his decisions were before me, and I did not put away his laws from me. 22:24 [hgb] 我 在 他 面 前 作 了 完 全 人 。 我 也 保 守 自 己 远 离 我 的 罪 孽 。 [kjv] I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. [bbe] And I was upright before him, and I kept myself from sin. 22:25 [hgb] 所 以 耶 和 华 按 我 的 公 义 ， 按 我 在 他 眼 前 的 清 洁 赏 赐 我 。 [kjv] Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight. [bbe] Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes. 22:26 [hgb] 慈 爱 的 人 ， 你 以 慈 爱 待 他 。 完 全 的 人 ， 你 以 完 全 待 他 。 [kjv] With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright. [bbe] On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright; 22:27 [hgb] 清 洁 的 人 ， 你 以 清 洁 待 他 。 乖 僻 的 人 ， 你 以 弯 曲 待 他 。 [kjv] With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. [bbe] He who is holy will see that you are holy; but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge. 22:28 [hgb] 困 苦 的 百 姓 ， 你 必 拯 救 。 但 你 的 眼 目 察 看 高 傲 的 人 ， 使 他 降 卑 。 [kjv] And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down. [bbe] For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble; but your eyes are on men of pride, to make them low. 22:29 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 是 我 的 灯 。 耶 和 华 必 照 明 我 的 黑 暗 。 [kjv] For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness. [bbe] For you are my light, O Lord; and the Lord will make the dark bright for me. 22:30 [hgb] 我 借 着 你 冲 入 敌 军 ， 借 着 我 的 神 跳 过 墙 垣 。 [kjv] For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall. [bbe] By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in: by the help of my God I have gone over a wall. 22:31 [hgb] 至 于 神 ， 他 的 道 是 完 全 的 。 耶 和 华 的 话 是 炼 净 的 。 凡 投 靠 他 的 ， 他 便 作 他 们 的 盾 牌 。 [kjv] As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him. [bbe] As for God, his way is all good: the word of the Lord is tested; he is a safe cover for all those who put their faith in him. 22:32 [hgb] 除 了 耶 和 华 ， 谁 是 神 呢 ？ 除 了 我 们 的 神 ， 谁 是 磐 石 呢 ？ [kjv] For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God? [bbe] For who is God but the Lord? and who is a Rock but our God? 22:33 [hgb] 神 是 我 坚 固 的 保 障 。 他 引 导 完 全 人 行 他 的 路 。 [kjv] God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. [bbe] God puts a strong band about me, guiding me in a straight way. 22:34 [hgb] 他 使 我 的 脚 快 如 母 鹿 的 蹄 ， 又 使 我 在 高 处 安 稳 。 [kjv] He maketh my feet like hinds\u0027 feet: and setteth me upon my high places. [bbe] He makes my feet like roes\u0027 feet, and puts me on high places. 22:35 [hgb] 他 教 导 我 的 手 能 以 争 战 ， 甚 至 我 的 膀 臂 能 开 铜 弓 。 [kjv] He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. [bbe] He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms. 22:36 [hgb] 你 把 你 的 救 恩 给 我 作 盾 牌 。 你 的 温 和 使 我 为 大 。 [kjv] Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. [bbe] You have given me the breastplate of your salvation, and your mercy has made me great. 22:37 [hgb] 你 使 我 脚 下 的 地 步 宽 阔 。 我 的 脚 未 曾 滑 跌 。 [kjv] Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip. [bbe] You have made my steps wide under me, so that my feet make no slip. 22:38 [hgb] 我 追 赶 我 的 仇 敌 ， 灭 绝 了 他 们 ， 未 灭 以 先 ， 我 没 有 归 回 。 [kjv] I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them. [bbe] I go after my haters and overtake them; not turning back till they are all overcome. 22:39 [hgb] 我 灭 绝 了 他 们 ， 打 伤 了 他 们 ， 使 他 们 不 能 起 来 。 他 们 都 倒 在 我 的 脚 下 。 [kjv] And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet. [bbe] I have sent destruction on them and given them wounds, so that they are not able to get up: they are stretched under my feet. 22:40 [hgb] 因 为 你 曾 以 力 量 束 我 的 腰 ， 使 我 能 争 战 。 你 也 使 那 起 来 攻 击 我 的 都 服 在 我 以 下 。 [kjv] For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. [bbe] For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who came out against me. 22:41 [hgb] 你 又 使 我 的 仇 敌 在 我 面 前 转 背 逃 跑 ， 叫 我 能 以 剪 除 那 恨 我 的 人 。 [kjv] Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. [bbe] By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off. 22:42 [hgb] 他 们 仰 望 ， 却 无 人 拯 救 。 就 是 呼 求 耶 和 华 ， 他 也 不 应 允 。 [kjv] They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not. [bbe] They were crying out, but there was no one to come to their help: even to the Lord, but he gave them no answer. 22:43 [hgb] 我 捣 碎 他 们 ， 如 同 地 上 的 灰 尘 ， 践 踏 他 们 ， 四 散 在 地 ， 如 同 街 上 的 泥 土 。 [kjv] Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad. [bbe] Then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth, stamped down under my feet like the waste of the streets. 22:44 [hgb] 你 救 我 脱 离 我 百 姓 的 争 竞 ， 保 护 我 作 列 国 的 元 首 。 我 素 不 认 识 的 民 必 事 奉 我 。 [kjv] Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me. [bbe] You have made me free from the fightings of my people; you have made me the head of the nations: a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants. 22:45 [hgb] 外 邦 人 要 投 降 我 ， 一 听 见 我 的 名 声 就 必 顺 从 我 。 [kjv] Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me. [bbe] Men of other countries will, with false hearts, put themselves under my authority: from the time when my name comes to their ears, they will be ruled by me. 22:46 [hgb] 外 邦 人 要 衰 残 ， 战 战 兢 兢 地 出 他 们 的 营 寨 。 [kjv] Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places. [bbe] They will be wasted away, they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear. 22:47 [hgb] 耶 和 华 是 活 神 ， 愿 我 的 磐 石 被 人 称 颂 。 愿 神 那 拯 救 我 的 磐 石 被 人 尊 崇 。 [kjv] The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. [bbe] The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured: 22:48 [hgb] 这 位 神 就 是 那 为 我 伸 冤 ， 使 众 民 服 在 我 以 下 的 。 [kjv] It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me, [bbe] It is God who sends punishment on my haters, and puts peoples under my rule. 22:49 [hgb] 你 救 我 脱 离 仇 敌 ， 又 把 我 举 起 ， 高 过 那 些 起 来 攻 击 我 的 。 你 救 我 脱 离 强 暴 的 人 。 [kjv] And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. [bbe] He makes me free from my haters: I am lifted up over those who come up against me: you have made me free from the violent man. 22:50 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 因 此 我 要 在 外 邦 中 称 谢 你 ， 歌 颂 你 的 名 。 [kjv] Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name. [bbe] Because of this I will give you praise, O Lord, among the nations, and will make a song of praise to your name. 22:51 [hgb] 耶 和 华 赐 极 大 的 救 恩 给 他 所 立 的 王 ， 施 慈 爱 给 他 的 受 膏 者 ， 就 是 给 大 卫 和 他 的 后 裔 ， 直 到 永 远 。 [kjv] He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore. [bbe] Great salvation does he give to his king; he has mercy on the king of his selection, David, and on his seed for ever.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1497.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
