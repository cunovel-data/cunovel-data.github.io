{"id":7187,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"9:1 [hgb] 大 卫 问 说 ， 扫 罗 家 还 有 剩 下 的 人 没 有 。 我 要 因 约 拿 单 的 缘 故 向 他 施 恩 。 \n [kjv] And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan\u0027s sake? \n [bbe] And David said, Is there still anyone of Saul\u0027s family living, so that I may be a friend to him, because of Jonathan? \n 9:2 [hgb] 扫 罗 家 有 一 个 仆 人 ， 名 叫 洗 巴 ， 有 人 叫 他 来 见 大 卫 ， 王 问 他 说 ， 你 是 洗 巴 吗 ？ 回 答 说 ， 仆 人 是 。 \n [kjv] And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he. \n [bbe] Now there was of Saul\u0027s people a servant named Ziba, and they sent him to David; and the king said to him, Are you Ziba? And he said, I am. \n 9:3 [hgb] 王 说 ， 扫 罗 家 还 有 人 没 有 。 我 要 照 神 的 慈 爱 恩 待 他 。 洗 巴 对 王 说 ， 还 有 约 拿 单 的 一 个 儿 子 ， 是 瘸 腿 的 。 \n [kjv] And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet. \n [bbe] And the king said, Is there anyone of Saul\u0027s family still living, to whom I may be a friend in God\u0027s name? And Ziba said, There is a son of Jonathan, whose feet are damaged. \n 9:4 [hgb] 王 说 ， 他 在 哪 里 。 洗 巴 对 王 说 ， 他 在 罗 底 巴 ， 亚 米 利 的 儿 子 玛 吉 家 里 。 \n [kjv] And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar. \n [bbe] And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, He is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar. \n 9:5 [hgb] 于 是 大 卫 王 打 发 人 去 ， 从 罗 底 巴 亚 米 利 的 儿 子 玛 吉 家 里 召 了 他 来 。 \n [kjv] Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar. \n [bbe] Then King David sent, and had him taken from Lo-debar, from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel. \n 9:6 [hgb] 扫 罗 的 孙 子 ， 约 拿 单 的 儿 子 米 非 波 设 来 见 大 卫 ， 伏 地 叩 拜 。 大 卫 说 ， 米 非 波 设 。 米 非 波 设 说 ， 仆 人 在 此 。 \n [kjv] Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant! \n [bbe] And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, came to David, and falling down on his face, gave him honour. And David said, Mephibosheth. And answering he said, Your servant is here. \n 9:7 [hgb] 大 卫 说 ， 你 不 要 惧 怕 ， 我 必 因 你 父 亲 约 拿 单 的 缘 故 施 恩 与 你 ， 将 你 祖 父 扫 罗 的 一 切 田 地 都 归 还 你 。 你 也 可 以 常 与 我 同 席 吃 饭 。 \n [kjv] And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father\u0027s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. \n [bbe] And David said to him, Have no fear: for truly I will be good to you, because of your father Jonathan, and I will give back to you all the land which was Saul\u0027s; and you will have a place at my table at all times. \n 9:8 [hgb] 米 非 波 设 又 叩 拜 ， 说 ， 仆 人 算 什 么 ， 不 过 如 死 狗 一 般 ， 竟 蒙 王 这 样 眷 顾 。 \n [kjv] And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am? \n [bbe] And he went down on his face before the king, and said, What is your servant, for you to take note of a dead dog such as I am? \n 9:9 [hgb] 王 召 了 扫 罗 的 仆 人 洗 巴 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 我 已 将 属 扫 罗 和 他 的 一 切 家 产 都 赐 给 你 主 人 的 儿 子 了 。 \n [kjv] Then the king called to Ziba, Saul\u0027s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master\u0027s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house. \n [bbe] Then the king sent for Ziba, Saul\u0027s servant, and said to him, All the property of Saul and of his family I have given to your master\u0027s son. \n 9:10 [hgb] 你 和 你 的 众 子 ， 仆 人 要 为 你 主 人 的 儿 子 米 非 波 设 耕 种 田 地 ， 把 所 产 的 拿 来 供 他 食 用 。 他 却 要 常 与 我 同 席 吃 饭 。 洗 巴 有 十 五 个 儿 子 ， 二 十 个 仆 人 。 \n [kjv] Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master\u0027s son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master\u0027s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. \n [bbe] And you and your sons and your servants are to take care of the land for him, and get in the fruit of it, so that your master\u0027s son may have food: but Mephibosheth, your master\u0027s son, will have a place at my table at all times. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. \n 9:11 [hgb] 洗 巴 对 王 说 ， 凡 我 主 我 王 吩 咐 仆 人 的 ， 仆 人 都 必 遵 行 。 王 又 说 ， 米 非 波 设 必 与 我 同 席 吃 饭 ， 如 王 的 儿 子 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king\u0027s sons. \n [bbe] Then Ziba said to the king, Every order which you have given to your servant will be done. As for Mephibosheth, he had a place at David\u0027s table, like one of the king\u0027s sons. \n 9:12 [hgb] 米 非 波 设 有 一 个 小 儿 子 ， 名 叫 米 迦 。 凡 住 在 洗 巴 家 里 的 人 都 作 了 米 非 波 设 的 仆 人 。 \n [kjv] And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. \n [bbe] And Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. And all the people living in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth. \n 9:13 [hgb] 于 是 米 非 波 设 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 常 与 王 同 席 吃 饭 。 他 两 腿 都 是 瘸 的 。 \n [kjv] So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king\u0027s table; and was lame on both his feet. \n [bbe] So Mephibosheth went on living in Jerusalem; for he took all his meals at the king\u0027s table; and he had not the use of his feet. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1484.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
