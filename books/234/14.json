{"id":7192,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"14:1 [hgb] 洗 鲁 雅 的 儿 子 约 押 ， 知 道 王 心 里 想 念 押 沙 龙 ， [kjv] Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king\u0027s heart was toward Absalom. [bbe] Now it was clear to Joab, the son of Zeruiah, that the king\u0027s heart was turning to Absalom. 14:2 [hgb] 就 打 发 人 往 提 哥 亚 去 ， 从 那 里 叫 了 一 个 聪 明 的 妇 人 来 ， 对 她 说 ， 请 你 假 装 居 丧 的 ， 穿 上 孝 衣 ， 不 要 用 膏 抹 身 ， 要 装 作 为 死 者 许 久 悲 哀 的 妇 人 。 [kjv] And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead: [bbe] And Joab sent to Tekoa and got from there a wise woman, and said to her, Now make yourself seem like one given up to grief, and put on the clothing of sorrow, not using any sweet oil for your body, but looking like one who for a long time has been weeping for the dead: 14:3 [hgb] 进 去 见 王 ， 对 王 如 此 如 此 说 。 于 是 约 押 将 当 说 的 话 教 导 了 妇 人 。 [kjv] And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth. [bbe] And come to the king and say these words to him. So Joab gave her words to say. 14:4 [hgb] 提 哥 亚 妇 人 到 王 面 前 ， 伏 地 叩 拜 ， 说 ， 王 阿 ， 求 你 拯 救 。 [kjv] And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king. [bbe] And the woman of Tekoa came to the king, and falling on her face, gave him honour and said, Give me help, O king. 14:5 [hgb] 王 问 她 说 ， 你 有 什 么 事 呢 ？ 回 答 说 ， 婢 女 实 在 是 寡 妇 ， 我 丈 夫 死 了 。 [kjv] And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead. [bbe] And the king said to her, What is your trouble? And her answer was, Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead. 14:6 [hgb] 我 有 两 个 儿 子 ， 一 日 在 田 间 争 斗 ， 没 有 人 解 劝 ， 这 个 就 打 死 那 个 。 [kjv] And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him. [bbe] And I had two sons, and the two of them had a fight in the field, and there was no one to come between them, and one with a blow put the other to death. 14:7 [hgb] 现 在 全 家 的 人 都 起 来 攻 击 婢 女 ， 说 ， 你 将 那 打 死 兄 弟 的 交 出 来 ， 我 们 好 治 死 他 ， 偿 他 打 死 兄 弟 的 命 ， 灭 绝 那 承 受 家 业 的 。 这 样 ， 他 们 要 将 我 剩 下 的 炭 火 灭 尽 ， 不 与 我 丈 夫 留 名 留 后 在 世 上 。 [kjv] And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth. [bbe] And now all the family is turned against me, your servant, saying, Give up him who was the cause of his brother\u0027s death, so that we may put him to death in payment for the life of his brother, whose life he took; and we will put an end to the one who will get the heritage: so they will put out my last burning coal, and my husband will have no name or offspring on the face of the earth. 14:8 [hgb] 王 对 妇 人 说 ， 你 回 家 去 吧 。 我 必 为 你 下 令 。 [kjv] And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee. [bbe] And the king said to the woman, Go to your house and I will give orders about this. 14:9 [hgb] 提 哥 亚 妇 人 又 对 王 说 ， 我 主 我 王 ， 愿 这 罪 归 我 和 我 父 家 ， 与 王 和 王 的 位 无 干 。 [kjv] And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father\u0027s house: and the king and his throne be guiltless. [bbe] And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, may the sin be on me and on my family, and may the king and the seat of his kingdom be clear of sin! 14:10 [hgb] 王 说 ， 凡 难 为 你 的 ， 你 就 带 他 到 我 这 里 来 ， 他 必 不 再 搅 扰 你 。 [kjv] And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more. [bbe] And the king said, If anyone says anything to you, make him come to me, and he will do you no more damage. 14:11 [hgb] 妇 人 说 ， 愿 王 记 念 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 不 许 报 血 仇 的 人 施 行 灭 绝 ， 恐 怕 他 们 灭 绝 我 的 儿 子 。 王 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 你 的 儿 子 连 一 根 头 发 也 不 至 落 在 地 上 。 [kjv] Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth. [bbe] Then she said, Let the king keep in mind the Lord your God, so that he who gives punishment for blood may be kept back from further destruction and that no one may send death on my son. And he said, By the living Lord, not a hair of your son\u0027s head will come to the earth. 14:12 [hgb] 妇 人 说 ， 求 我 主 我 王 容 婢 女 再 说 一 句 话 。 王 说 ， 你 说 吧 。 [kjv] Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on. [bbe] Then the woman said, Will the king let his servant say one word more? And he said, Say on. 14:13 [hgb] 妇 人 说 ， 王 为 何 也 起 意 要 害 神 的 民 呢 ？ 王 不 使 那 逃 亡 的 人 回 来 ， 王 的 这 话 就 是 自 证 己 错 了 。 [kjv] And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished. [bbe] And the woman said, Why have you had such a thought about the people of God? (for in saying these very words the king has put himself in the wrong because he has not taken back the one whom he sent far away.) 14:14 [hgb] 我 们 都 是 必 死 的 ， 如 同 水 泼 在 地 上 ， 不 能 收 回 。 神 并 不 夺 取 人 的 性 命 ， 乃 设 法 使 逃 亡 的 人 不 至 成 为 赶 出 回 不 来 的 。 [kjv] For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him. [bbe] For death comes to us all, and we are like water drained out on the earth, which it is not possible to take up again; and God will not take away the life of the man whose purpose is that he who has been sent away may not be completely cut off from him. 14:15 [hgb] 我 来 将 这 话 告 诉 我 主 我 王 ， 是 因 百 姓 使 我 惧 怕 。 婢 女 想 ， 不 如 将 这 话 告 诉 王 ， 或 者 王 成 就 婢 女 所 求 的 。 [kjv] Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid. [bbe] And now it is my fear of the people which has made me come to say these words to my lord the king: and your servant said, I will put my cause before the king, and it may be that he will give effect to my request. 14:16 [hgb] 人 要 将 我 和 我 儿 子 从 神 的 地 业 上 一 同 除 灭 ， 王 必 应 允 救 我 脱 离 他 的 手 。 [kjv] For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. [bbe] For the king will give ear, and take his servant out of the power of the man whose purpose is the destruction of me and my son together from the heritage of God. 14:17 [hgb] 婢 女 又 想 ， 我 主 我 王 的 话 必 安 慰 我 。 因 为 我 主 我 王 能 辨 别 是 非 ， 如 同 神 的 使 者 一 样 。 惟 愿 耶 和 华 你 的 神 与 你 同 在 。 [kjv] Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee. [bbe] Then your servant said, May the word of my lord the king give me peace! for my lord the king is as the angel of God in his hearing of good and bad: and may the Lord your God be with you! 14:18 [hgb] 王 对 妇 人 说 ， 我 要 问 你 一 句 话 ， 你 一 点 不 要 瞒 我 。 妇 人 说 ， 愿 我 主 我 王 说 。 [kjv] Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak. [bbe] Then the king said to the woman, Now give me an answer to the question I am going to put to you; keep nothing back. And the woman said, Let my lord the king say on. 14:19 [hgb] 王 说 ， 你 这 些 话 莫 非 是 约 押 的 主 意 吗 ？ 妇 人 说 ， 我 敢 在 我 主 我 王 面 前 起 誓 ， 王 的 话 正 对 ， 不 偏 左 右 ， 是 王 的 仆 人 约 押 吩 咐 我 的 ， 这 些 话 是 他 教 导 我 的 。 [kjv] And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid: [bbe] And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman in answer said, By the life of your soul, my lord the king, it is not possible for anyone to go to the right hand or to the left from anything said by the king: your servant Joab gave me orders, and put all these words in my mouth: 14:20 [hgb] 王 的 仆 人 约 押 如 此 行 ， 为 要 挽 回 这 事 。 我 主 的 智 慧 却 如 神 使 者 的 智 慧 ， 能 知 世 上 一 切 事 。 [kjv] To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth. [bbe] This he did, hoping that the face of this business might be changed: and my lord is wise, with the wisdom of the angel of God, having knowledge of everything on earth. 14:21 [hgb] 王 对 约 押 说 ， 我 应 允 你 这 事 。 你 可 以 去 ， 把 那 少 年 人 押 沙 龙 带 回 来 。 [kjv] And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again. [bbe] And the king said to Joab, See now, I will do this thing: go then and Come back with the young man Absalom. 14:22 [hgb] 约 押 就 面 伏 于 地 叩 拜 ， 祝 谢 于 王 ， 又 说 ， 王 既 应 允 仆 人 所 求 的 ， 仆 人 今 日 知 道 在 我 主 我 王 眼 前 蒙 恩 了 。 [kjv] And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant. [bbe] Then Joab, falling down on his face on the earth, gave the king honour and blessing; and Joab said, Today it is clear to your servant that I have grace in your eyes, my lord king, because the king has given effect to the request of his servant. 14:23 [hgb] 于 是 约 押 起 身 往 基 述 去 ， 将 押 沙 龙 带 回 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. [bbe] So Joab got up and went to Geshur and came back again to Jerusalem with Absalom. 14:24 [hgb] 王 说 ， 使 他 回 自 己 家 里 去 ， 不 要 见 我 的 面 。 押 沙 龙 就 回 自 己 家 里 去 ， 没 有 见 王 的 面 。 [kjv] And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king\u0027s face. [bbe] And the king said, Let him go to his house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom went back to his house and did not see the face of the king. 14:25 [hgb] 以 色 列 全 地 之 中 ， 无 人 像 押 沙 龙 那 样 俊 美 ， 得 人 的 称 赞 ， 从 脚 底 到 头 顶 毫 无 瑕 疵 。 [kjv] But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. [bbe] Now in all Israel there was no one so greatly to be praised for his beautiful form as Absalom: from his feet to the crown of his head he was completely beautiful. 14:26 [hgb] 他 的 头 发 甚 重 ， 每 到 年 底 剪 发 一 次 。 所 剪 下 来 的 ， 按 王 的 平 称 一 称 ， 重 二 百 舍 客 勒 。 [kjv] And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year\u0027s end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king\u0027s weight. [bbe] And when he had his hair cut, (which he did at the end of every year, because of the weight of his hair;) the weight of the hair was two hundred shekels by the king\u0027s weight. 14:27 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 生 了 三 个 儿 子 ， 一 个 女 儿 。 女 儿 名 叫 他 玛 ， 是 个 容 貌 俊 美 的 女 子 。 [kjv] And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance. [bbe] And Absalom was the father of three sons and of one daughter named Tamar, who was very beautiful. 14:28 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 足 有 二 年 ， 没 有 见 王 的 面 。 [kjv] So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king\u0027s face. [bbe] For two full years Absalom was living in Jerusalem without ever seeing the face of the king. 14:29 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 打 发 人 去 叫 约 押 来 ， 要 托 他 去 见 王 ， 约 押 却 不 肯 来 。 第 二 次 打 发 人 去 叫 他 ， 他 仍 不 肯 来 。 [kjv] Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come. [bbe] Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come. 14:30 [hgb] 所 以 押 沙 龙 对 仆 人 说 ， 你 们 看 ， 约 押 有 一 块 田 ， 与 我 的 田 相 近 ， 其 中 有 大 麦 ， 你 们 去 放 火 烧 了 。 押 沙 龙 的 仆 人 就 去 放 火 烧 了 那 田 。 [kjv] Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab\u0027s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom\u0027s servants set the field on fire. [bbe] So he said to his servants, See, Joab\u0027s field is near mine, and he has barley in it; go and put it on fire. And Absalom\u0027s servants put the field on fire. 14:31 [hgb] 于 是 约 押 起 来 ， 到 了 押 沙 龙 家 里 ， 问 他 说 ， 你 的 仆 人 为 何 放 火 烧 了 我 的 田 呢 ？ [kjv] Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire? [bbe] Then Joab came to Absalom in his house and said to him, Why have your servants put my field on fire? 14:32 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 回 答 约 押 说 ， 我 打 发 人 去 请 你 来 ， 好 托 你 去 见 王 ， 替 我 说 ， 我 为 何 从 基 述 回 来 呢 ？ 不 如 仍 在 那 里 。 现 在 要 许 我 见 王 的 面 。 我 若 有 罪 ， 任 凭 王 杀 我 就 是 了 。 [kjv] And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king\u0027s face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me. [bbe] And Absalom\u0027s answer was, See, I sent to you saying, Come here, so that I may send you to the king to say, Why have I come back from Geshur? it would be better for me to be there still: let me now see the king\u0027s face, and if there is any sin in me, let him put me to death. 14:33 [hgb] 于 是 约 押 去 见 王 ， 将 这 话 奏 告 王 ， 王 便 叫 押 沙 龙 来 。 押 沙 龙 来 见 王 ， 在 王 面 前 俯 伏 于 地 ， 王 就 与 押 沙 龙 亲 嘴 。 [kjv] So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom. [bbe] So Joab went to the king and said these words to him: and when the king had sent for him, Absalom came, and went down on his face on the earth before the king: and the king gave him a kiss.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1489.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
