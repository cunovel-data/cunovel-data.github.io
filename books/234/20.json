{"id":7198,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"20:1 [hgb] 在 那 里 恰 巧 有 一 个 匪 徒 ， 名 叫 示 巴 ， 是 便 雅 悯 人 比 基 利 的 儿 子 。 他 吹 角 ， 说 ， 我 们 与 大 卫 无 分 ， 与 耶 西 的 儿 子 无 涉 。 以 色 列 人 哪 ， 你 们 各 回 各 家 去 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] Now by chance there was present a good-for-nothing person named Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he, sounding the horn, said, We have no part in David, or any interest in the son of Jesse: let every man go to his tent, O Israel. \\n\\n 20:2 [hgb] 于 是 以 色 列 人 都 离 开 大 卫 ， 跟 随 比 基 利 的 儿 子 示 巴 。 但 犹 大 人 从 约 旦 河 直 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 都 紧 紧 跟 随 他 们 的 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem. \\n\\n [bbe] So all the men of Israel, turning away from David, went after Sheba, the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah were true to their king, going with him from Jordan as far as Jerusalem. \\n\\n 20:3 [hgb] 大 卫 王 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 进 了 宫 殿 ， 就 把 从 前 留 下 看 守 宫 殿 的 十 个 妃 嫔 禁 闭 在 冷 宫 ， 养 活 她 们 ， 不 与 她 们 亲 近 。 她 们 如 同 寡 妇 被 禁 ， 直 到 死 的 日 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood. \\n\\n [bbe] And David came to his house at Jerusalem: and the king took the ten women to whom he had given the care of the house, and had them shut up, and gave them the necessaries of life, but did not go near them. So they were shut up till the day of their death, living as widows. \\n\\n 20:4 [hgb] 王 对 亚 玛 撒 说 ， 你 要 在 三 日 之 内 将 犹 大 人 招 聚 了 来 ， 你 也 回 到 这 里 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the king said to Amasa, Get all the men of Judah together, and in three days be here yourself. \\n\\n 20:5 [hgb] 亚 玛 撒 就 去 招 聚 犹 大 人 ， 却 耽 延 过 了 王 所 限 的 日 期 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him. \\n\\n [bbe] So Amasa went to get all the men of Judah together, but he took longer than the time David had given him. \\n\\n 20:6 [hgb] 大 卫 对 亚 比 筛 说 ， 现 在 恐 怕 比 基 利 的 儿 子 示 巴 加 害 于 我 们 比 押 沙 龙 更 甚 。 你 要 带 领 你 主 的 仆 人 追 赶 他 ， 免 得 他 得 了 坚 固 城 ， 躲 避 我 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord\u0027s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to Abishai, Sheba, the son of Bichri, will do us more damage than Absalom did; so take some of your lord\u0027s servants and go after him, before he makes himself safe in the walled towns, and gets away before our eyes. \\n\\n 20:7 [hgb] 约 押 的 人 和 基 利 提 人 ， 比 利 提 人 ， 并 所 有 的 勇 士 ， 都 跟 着 亚 比 筛 ， 从 耶 路 撒 冷 出 去 追 赶 比 基 利 的 儿 子 示 巴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there went out after him Joab\u0027s men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. \\n\\n [bbe] So there went after Abishai, Joab and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the fighting-men; they went out of Jerusalem to overtake Sheba, the son of Bichri. \\n\\n 20:8 [hgb] 他 们 到 了 基 遍 的 大 磐 石 那 里 ， 亚 玛 撒 来 迎 接 他 们 。 那 时 约 押 穿 着 战 衣 ， 腰 束 佩 刀 的 带 子 ， 刀 在 鞘 内 。 约 押 前 行 ， 刀 从 鞘 内 掉 出 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab\u0027s garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out. \\n\\n [bbe] When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came face to face with them. Now Joab had on his war-dress, and round him a band from which his sword was hanging in its cover; and while he was walking, it came out, falling to the earth. \\n\\n 20:9 [hgb] 约 押 左 手 拾 起 刀 来 ， 对 亚 玛 撒 说 ， 我 兄 弟 ， 你 好 阿 。 就 用 右 手 抓 住 亚 玛 撒 的 胡 子 ， 要 与 他 亲 嘴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him. \\n\\n [bbe] And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well, my brother? And with his right hand he took him by the hair of his chin to give him a kiss. \\n\\n 20:10 [hgb] 亚 玛 撒 没 有 防 备 约 押 手 里 所 拿 的 刀 。 约 押 用 刀 刺 入 他 的 肚 腹 ， 他 的 肠 子 流 在 地 上 ， 没 有 再 刺 他 ， 就 死 了 。 约 押 和 他 兄 弟 亚 比 筛 往 前 追 赶 比 基 利 的 儿 子 示 巴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab\u0027s hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. \\n\\n [bbe] But Amasa did not see danger from the sword which was now in Joab\u0027s left hand, and Joab put it through his stomach so that his inside came out on to the earth, and he did not give him another blow. So Joab and his brother Abishai went on after Sheba, the son of Bichri. \\n\\n 20:11 [hgb] 有 约 押 的 一 个 少 年 人 站 在 亚 玛 撒 尸 身 旁 边 ， 对 众 人 说 ， 谁 喜 悦 约 押 ， 谁 归 顺 大 卫 ， 就 当 跟 随 约 押 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And one of Joab\u0027s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab. \\n\\n [bbe] And one of Joab\u0027s young men, taking his place at Amasa\u0027s side, said, Whoever is for Joab and for David, let him go after Joab! \\n\\n 20:12 [hgb] 亚 玛 撒 在 道 路 上 滚 在 自 己 的 血 里 。 那 人 见 众 民 经 过 都 站 住 ， 就 把 亚 玛 撒 的 尸 身 从 路 上 挪 到 田 间 ， 用 衣 服 遮 盖 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still. \\n\\n [bbe] And Amasa was stretched out in a pool of blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people were stopping, he took Amasa out of the highway and put him in a field, with a cloth over him, when he saw that everyone who went by came to a stop. \\n\\n 20:13 [hgb] 尸 身 从 路 上 挪 移 之 后 ， 众 民 就 都 跟 随 约 押 去 追 赶 比 基 利 的 儿 子 示 巴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. \\n\\n [bbe] When he had been taken off the road, all the people went on after Joab in search of Sheba, the son of Bichri. \\n\\n 20:14 [hgb] 他 走 遍 以 色 列 各 支 派 ， 直 到 伯 玛 迦 的 亚 比 拉 ， 并 比 利 人 的 全 地 。 那 些 地 方 的 人 也 都 聚 集 跟 随 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him. \\n\\n [bbe] And Sheba went through all the tribes of Israel, to Abel of Beth-maacah; and all the Bichrites came together and went in after him. \\n\\n 20:15 [hgb] 约 押 和 跟 随 的 人 到 了 伯 玛 迦 的 亚 比 拉 ， 围 困 示 巴 ， 就 对 着 城 筑 垒 。 跟 随 约 押 的 众 民 用 锤 撞 城 ， 要 使 城 塌 陷 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down. \\n\\n [bbe] And Joab and his men got him shut up in Abel of Beth-maacah, and put up an earthwork against the town: and all Joab\u0027s men did their best to get the wall broken down. \\n\\n 20:16 [hgb] 有 一 个 聪 明 妇 人 从 城 上 呼 叫 说 ， 听 阿 ， 听 阿 ， 请 约 押 近 前 来 ， 我 好 与 他 说 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee. \\n\\n [bbe] Then a wise woman got up on the wall, and crying out from the town, said, Give ear, give ear; say now to Joab, Come near, so that I may have talk with you. \\n\\n 20:17 [hgb] 约 押 就 近 前 来 ， 妇 人 问 他 说 ， 你 是 约 押 不 是 。 他 说 ， 我 是 。 妇 人 说 ， 求 你 听 婢 女 的 话 。 约 押 说 ， 我 听 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear. \\n\\n [bbe] And he came near, and the woman said, Are you Joab? And he said in answer, I am. Then she said, Give ear to your servant\u0027s words. And he said, I am giving ear. \\n\\n 20:18 [hgb] 妇 人 说 ， 古 时 有 话 说 ， 当 先 在 亚 比 拉 求 问 ， 然 后 事 就 定 妥 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter. \\n\\n [bbe] Then she said, In the old days, there was a saying, Let them put the question in Abel and in Dan, saying, Has what was ordered by men of good faith in Israel ever come to an end? \\n\\n 20:19 [hgb] 我 们 这 城 的 人 在 以 色 列 人 中 是 和 平 ， 忠 厚 的 。 你 为 何 要 毁 坏 以 色 列 中 的 大 城 ， 吞 灭 耶 和 华 的 产 业 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD? \\n\\n [bbe] Your purpose is the destruction of a mother-town in Israel: why would you put an end to the heritage of the Lord? \\n\\n 20:20 [hgb] 约 押 回 答 说 ， 我 决 不 吞 灭 毁 坏 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. \\n\\n [bbe] And Joab, answering her, said, Far, far be it from me to be a cause of death or destruction; \\n\\n 20:21 [hgb] 乃 因 以 法 莲 山 地 的 一 个 人 比 基 利 的 儿 子 示 巴 举 手 攻 击 大 卫 王 ， 你 们 若 将 他 一 人 交 出 来 ， 我 便 离 城 而 去 。 妇 人 对 约 押 说 ， 那 人 的 首 级 必 从 城 墙 上 丢 给 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall. \\n\\n [bbe] Not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba, son of Bichri, by name, has taken up arms against the king, against David: give up this man only, and I will go away from the town. And the woman said to Joab, His head will be dropped over the wall to you. \\n\\n 20:22 [hgb] 妇 人 就 凭 她 的 智 慧 去 劝 众 人 。 他 们 便 割 下 比 基 利 的 儿 子 示 巴 的 首 级 ， 丢 给 约 押 。 约 押 吹 角 ， 众 人 就 离 城 而 散 ， 各 归 各 家 去 了 。 约 押 回 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 到 王 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the woman in her wisdom had talk with all the town. And they had Sheba\u0027s head cut off and sent out to Joab. And he had the horn sounded, and sent them all away from the town, every man to his tent. And Joab went back to Jerusalem to the king. \\n\\n 20:23 [hgb] 约 押 作 以 色 列 全 军 的 元 帅 。 耶 何 耶 大 的 儿 子 比 拿 雅 统 辖 基 利 提 人 和 比 利 提 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: \\n\\n [bbe] Now Joab was over all the army; and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was at the head of the Cherethites and the Pelethites; \\n\\n 20:24 [hgb] 亚 多 兰 掌 管 服 苦 的 人 。 亚 希 律 的 儿 子 约 沙 法 作 史 官 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder: \\n\\n [bbe] And Adoram was overseer of the forced work; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder; \\n\\n 20:25 [hgb] 示 法 作 书 记 。 撒 督 和 亚 比 亚 他 作 祭 司 长 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests: \\n\\n [bbe] And Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; \\n\\n 20:26 [hgb] 睚 珥 人 以 拉 作 大 卫 的 宰 相 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David. \\n\\n [bbe] And in addition, Ira the Jairite was a priest to David. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1495.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
