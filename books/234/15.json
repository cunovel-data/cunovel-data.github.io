And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. \n [bbe] And Absalom got up early, morning after morning, and took his place at the side of the public meeting-place: and when any man had a cause which had to come to the king to be judged, then Absalom, crying out to him, said, What is your town? and he would say, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. \n 15:3 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 对 他 说 ， 你 的 事 有 情 有 理 ， 无 奈 王 没 有 委 人 听 你 伸 诉 。 \n [kjv] And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee. \n [bbe] And Absalom would say to him, See, your cause is true and right; but no man has been named by the king to give you a hearing. \n 15:4 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 又 说 ， 恨 不 得 我 作 国 中 的 士 师 。 凡 有 争 讼 求 审 判 的 到 我 这 里 来 ， 我 必 秉 公 判 断 。 \n [kjv] Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! \n [bbe] And more than this, Absalom said, If only I was made judge in the land, so that every man who has any cause or question might come to me, and I would give a right decision for him! \n 15:5 [hgb] 若 有 人 近 前 来 要 拜 押 沙 龙 ， 押 沙 龙 就 伸 手 拉 住 他 ， 与 他 亲 嘴 。 \n [kjv] And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him. \n [bbe] And if any man came near to give him honour, he took him by the hand and gave him a kiss. \n 15:6 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 中 ， 凡 去 见 王 求 判 断 的 ， 押 沙 龙 都 是 如 此 待 他 们 。 这 样 ， 押 沙 龙 暗 中 得 了 以 色 列 人 的 心 。 \n [kjv] And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. \n [bbe] And this Absalom did to everyone in Israel who came to the king to have his cause judged: so Absalom, like a thief, took away the hearts of the men of Israel. \n 15:7 [hgb] 满 了 四 十 年 （ 有 作 四 年 的 ） ， 押 沙 龙 对 王 说 ， 求 你 准 我 往 希 伯 仑 去 ， 还 我 向 耶 和 华 所 许 的 愿 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. \n [bbe] Now at the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, Let me go to Hebron and give effect to the oath which I made to the Lord: \n 15:8 [hgb] 因 为 仆 人 住 在 亚 兰 的 基 述 ， 曾 许 愿 说 ， 耶 和 华 若 使 我 再 回 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 我 必 事 奉 他 。 \n [kjv] For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD. \n [bbe] For while I was living in Geshur in Aram, your servant made an oath, saying, If ever the Lord lets me come back to Jerusalem, I will give him worship in Hebron. \n 15:9 [hgb] 王 说 ， 你 平 平 安 安 地 去 吧 。 押 沙 龙 就 起 身 ， 往 希 伯 仑 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. \n [bbe] And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he got up and went to Hebron. \n 15:10 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 打 发 探 子 走 遍 以 色 列 各 支 派 ， 说 ， 你 们 一 听 见 角 声 就 说 ， 押 沙 龙 在 希 伯 仑 作 王 了 。 \n [kjv] But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. \n [bbe] But Absalom at the same time sent watchers through all the tribes of Israel to say, At the sound of the horn you are to say, Absalom is king in Hebron. \n 15:11 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 在 耶 路 撒 冷 请 了 二 百 人 与 他 同 去 ， 都 是 诚 诚 实 实 去 的 ， 并 不 知 道 其 中 的 真 情 。 \n [kjv] And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. \n [bbe] And with Absalom, at his request, went two hundred men from Jerusalem, who were completely unconscious of his designs. \n 15:12 [hgb] 押 沙 龙 献 祭 的 时 候 ， 打 发 人 去 将 大 卫 的 谋 士 ， 基 罗 人 亚 希 多 弗 从 他 本 城 请 了 来 。 于 是 叛 逆 的 势 派 甚 大 。 因 为 随 从 押 沙 龙 的 人 民 ， 日 渐 增 多 。 \n [kjv] And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David\u0027s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. \n [bbe] And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, one of David\u0027s helpers, from Giloh his town, while he was making the offerings. And the design against David became strong, for more and more people were joined to Absalom. \n 15:13 [hgb] 有 人 报 告 大 卫 说 ， 以 色 列 人 的 心 都 归 向 押 沙 龙 了 。 \n [kjv] And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. \n [bbe] And one came to David and said, The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom. \n 15:14 [hgb] 大 卫 就 对 耶 路 撒 冷 跟 随 他 的 臣 仆 说 ， 我 们 要 起 来 逃 走 ， 不 然 都 不 能 躲 避 押 沙 龙 了 。 要 速 速 地 去 ， 恐 怕 他 忽 然 来 到 ， 加 害 于 我 们 ， 用 刀 杀 尽 合 城 的 人 。 \n [kjv] And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. \n [bbe] And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Come, let us go in flight, or not one of us will be safe from Absalom: let us go without loss of time, or he will overtake us quickly and send evil on us, and put the town to the sword. \n 15:15 [hgb] 王 的 臣 仆 对 王 说 ， 我 主 我 王 所 定 的 ， 仆 人 都 愿 遵 行 。 \n [kjv] And the king\u0027s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint. \n [bbe] And the king\u0027s servants said to the king, See, your servants are ready to do whatever the king says is to be done. \n 15:16 [hgb] 于 是 王 带 着 全 家 的 人 出 去 了 ， 但 留 下 十 个 妃 嫔 看 守 宫 殿 。 \n [kjv] And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house. \n [bbe] So the king went out, taking with him all the people of his house, but for ten of his women, who were to take care of the house. \n 15:17 [hgb] 王 出 去 ， 众 民 都 跟 随 他 ， 到 伯 墨 哈 ， 就 住 下 了 。 \n [kjv] And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off. \n [bbe] And the king went out, and all his servants went after him, and made a stop at the Far House. \n 15:18 [hgb] 王 的 臣 仆 都 在 他 面 前 过 去 。 基 利 提 人 ， 比 利 提 人 ， 就 是 从 迦 特 跟 随 王 来 的 六 百 人 ， 也 都 在 他 面 前 过 去 。 \n [kjv] And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. \n [bbe] And all the people went on by his side; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the men of Ittai of Gath, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, went on before the king. \n 15:19 [hgb] 王 对 迦 特 人 以 太 说 ， 你 是 外 邦 逃 来 的 人 ， 为 什 么 与 我 们 同 去 呢 ？ 你 可 以 回 去 与 新 王 同 住 ， 或 者 回 你 本 地 去 吧 。 \n [kjv] Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile. \n [bbe] Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why are you coming with us? go back and keep with the king: for you are a man of another country, you are far from the land of your birth. \n 15:20 [hgb] 你 来 的 日 子 不 多 ， 我 今 日 怎 好 叫 你 与 我 们 一 同 飘 流 ， 没 有 一 定 的 住 处 呢 ？ 你 不 如 带 你 的 弟 兄 回 去 吧 。 愿 耶 和 华 用 慈 爱 诚 实 待 你 。 \n [kjv] Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee. \n [bbe] It was only yesterday you came to us; why then am I to make you go up and down with us? for I have to go where I may; go back then, and take your countrymen with you, and may the Lord\u0027s mercy and good faith be with you. \n 15:21 [hgb] 以 太 对 王 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 又 敢 在 王 面 前 起 誓 ， 无 论 生 死 ， 王 在 哪 里 ， 仆 人 也 必 在 哪 里 。 \n [kjv] And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be. \n [bbe] And Ittai the Gittite in answer said, By the living Lord, and by the life of my lord the king, in whatever place my lord the king may be, for life or death, there will your servant be. \n 15:22 [hgb] 大 卫 对 以 太 说 ， 你 前 去 过 河 吧 。 于 是 迦 特 人 以 太 带 着 跟 随 他 的 人 和 所 有 的 妇 人 孩 子 ， 就 都 过 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him. \n [bbe] And David said to Ittai, Go forward, then. And Ittai the Gittite went on, with all his men and all the little ones he had with him. \n 15:23 [hgb] 本 地 的 人 都 放 声 大 哭 。 众 民 尽 都 过 去 ， 王 也 过 了 汲 沦 溪 。 众 民 往 旷 野 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. \n [bbe] And there was great weeping in all the country when all the people went through; and the king himself was waiting in the Kidron valley and all the people went by him in the direction of the olive-tree on the edge of the waste land. \n 15:24 [hgb] 撒 督 和 抬 神 约 柜 的 利 未 人 也 一 同 来 了 ， 将 神 的 约 柜 放 下 。 亚 比 亚 他 上 来 ， 等 着 众 民 从 城 里 出 来 过 去 。 \n [kjv] And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city. \n [bbe] Then Zadok came, and Abiathar, and with them the ark of God\u0027s agreement: and they put down the ark of God, till all the people from the town had gone by. \n 15:25 [hgb] 王 对 撒 督 说 ， 你 将 神 的 约 柜 抬 回 城 去 。 我 若 在 耶 和 华 眼 前 蒙 恩 ， 他 必 使 我 回 来 ， 再 见 约 柜 和 他 的 居 所 。 \n [kjv] And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation: \n [bbe] And the king said to Zadok, Take the ark of God back into the town: if I have grace in the eyes of the Lord, he will let me come back and see it and his House again: \n 15:26 [hgb] 倘 若 他 说 ， 我 不 喜 悦 你 ， 看 哪 ， 我 在 这 里 ， 愿 他 凭 自 己 的 意 旨 待 我 。 \n [kjv] But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. \n [bbe] But if he says, I have no delight in you: then, here I am; let him do to me what seems good to him. \n 15:27 [hgb] 王 又 对 祭 司 撒 督 说 ， 你 不 是 先 见 吗 ？ 你 可 以 安 然 回 城 。 你 儿 子 亚 希 玛 斯 和 亚 比 亚 他 的 儿 子 约 拿 单 都 可 以 与 你 同 去 。 \n [kjv] The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. \n [bbe] The king said further to Zadok the priest, See, you and Abiathar are to go back to the town in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz, your son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar. \n 15:28 [hgb] 我 在 旷 野 的 渡 口 那 里 等 你 们 报 信 给 我 。 \n [kjv] See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. \n [bbe] See, I will be waiting at the way across the river, in the waste land, till I get news from you. \n 15:29 [hgb] 于 是 撒 督 和 亚 比 亚 他 将 神 的 约 柜 抬 回 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 他 们 就 住 在 那 里 。 \n [kjv] Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there. \n [bbe] So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and did not go away from there. \n 15:30 [hgb] 大 卫 蒙 头 赤 脚 上 橄 榄 山 ， 一 面 上 ， 一 面 哭 。 跟 随 他 的 人 也 都 蒙 头 哭 着 上 去 。 \n [kjv] And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. \n [bbe] And David went up the slopes of the Mount of Olives weeping all the way, with his head covered and no shoes on his feet: and all the people who were with him, covering their heads, went up weeping. \n 15:31 [hgb] 有 人 告 诉 大 卫 说 ， 亚 希 多 弗 也 在 叛 党 之 中 ， 随 从 押 沙 龙 。 大 卫 祷 告 说 ， 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 使 亚 希 多 弗 的 计 谋 变 为 愚 拙 。 \n [kjv] And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. \n [bbe] And word came to David, saying, Ahithophel is among those who are joined to Absalom. And David said, O Lord, let the wisdom of Ahithophel be made foolish. \n 15:32 [hgb] 大 卫 到 了 山 顶 ， 敬 拜 神 的 地 方 ， 见 亚 基 人 户 筛 ， 衣 服 撕 裂 ， 头 蒙 灰 尘 来 迎 接 他 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: \n [bbe] Now when David had come to the top of the slope, where they gave worship to God, Hushai the Archite came to him in great grief with dust on his head: \n 15:33 [hgb] 大 卫 对 他 说 ， 你 若 与 我 同 去 ， 必 累 赘 我 。 \n [kjv] Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: \n [bbe] David said to him, If you go on with me, you will be a trouble to me: \n 15:34 [hgb] 你 若 回 城 去 ， 对 押 沙 龙 说 ， 王 阿 ， 我 愿 作 你 的 仆 人 。 我 向 来 作 你 父 亲 的 仆 人 ， 现 在 我 也 照 样 作 你 的 仆 人 。 这 样 ， 你 就 可 以 为 我 破 坏 亚 希 多 弗 的 计 谋 。 \n [kjv] But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father\u0027s servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. \n [bbe] But if you go back to the town and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as in the past I have been your father\u0027s servant, so now I will be yours: then you will be able to keep Ahithophel\u0027s designs against me from being put into effect. \n 15:35 [hgb] 祭 司 撒 督 和 亚 比 亚 他 岂 不 都 在 那 里 吗 ？ 你 在 王 宫 里 听 见 什 么 ， 就 要 告 诉 祭 司 撒 督 和 亚 比 亚 他 。 \n [kjv] And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king\u0027s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. \n [bbe] And have you not there Zadok and Abiathar the priests? so whatever comes to your ears from the king\u0027s house, give word of it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. \n 15:36 [hgb] 撒 督 的 儿 子 亚 希 玛 斯 ， 亚 比 亚 他 的 儿 子 约 拿 单 ， 也 都 在 那 里 。 凡 你 们 所 听 见 的 可 以 托 这 二 人 来 报 告 我 。 \n [kjv] Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok\u0027s son, and Jonathan Abiathar\u0027s son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear. \n [bbe] See, they have with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok\u0027s son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar; by them you may send word to me of everything which comes to your ears. \n 15:37 [hgb] 于 是 ， 大 卫 的 朋 友 户 筛 进 了 城 。 押 沙 龙 也 进 了 耶 路 撒 冷 。 \n [kjv] So Hushai David\u0027s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem. \n [bbe] So Hushai, David\u0027s friend, went into the town, and Absalom came to Jerusalem. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86/1490.html","bookId":234,"book":{"id":234,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记下（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes r...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/86","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
