[bbe] And it came about after this that David made an attack on the Philistines and overcame them; and David took the authority of the mother-town from the hands of the Philistines. 8:2 [hgb] 又 攻 打 摩 押 人 ， 使 他 们 躺 卧 在 地 上 ， 用 绳 量 一 量 ， 量 二 绳 的 杀 了 ， 量 一 绳 的 存 留 。 摩 押 人 就 归 服 大 卫 ， 给 他 进 贡 。 [kjv] And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David\u0027s servants, and brought gifts. [bbe] And he overcame the Moabites, and he had them measured with a line when they were stretched out on the earth; marking out two lines for death and one full line for life. So the Moabites became servants to David and gave him offerings. 8:3 [hgb] 琐 巴 王 利 合 的 儿 子 哈 大 底 谢 往 大 河 去 ， 要 夺 回 他 的 国 权 。 大 卫 就 攻 打 他 ， [kjv] David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates. [bbe] And David overcame Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to make his power seen by the River. 8:4 [hgb] 擒 拿 了 他 的 马 兵 一 千 七 百 ， 步 兵 二 万 ， 将 拉 战 车 的 马 砍 断 蹄 筋 ， 但 留 下 一 百 辆 车 的 马 。 [kjv] And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots. [bbe] And David took from him one thousand, seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen: and David had the leg-muscles of the horses cut, only keeping enough of them for a hundred war-carriages. 8:5 [hgb] 大 马 色 的 亚 兰 人 来 帮 助 琐 巴 王 哈 大 底 谢 ， 大 卫 就 杀 了 亚 兰 人 二 万 二 千 。 [kjv] And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. [bbe] And when the Aramaeans of Damascus came to the help of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David put to the sword twenty-two thousand of the Aramaeans. 8:6 [hgb] 于 是 大 卫 在 大 马 色 的 亚 兰 地 设 立 防 营 ， 亚 兰 人 就 归 服 他 ， 给 他 进 贡 。 大 卫 无 论 往 哪 里 去 ， 耶 和 华 都 使 他 得 胜 。 [kjv] Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. [bbe] And David put armed forces in Aram of Damascus: and the Aramaeans became servants to David and gave him offerings. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went. 8:7 [hgb] 他 夺 了 哈 大 底 谢 臣 仆 所 拿 的 金 盾 牌 ， 带 到 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. [bbe] And David took their gold body-covers from the servants of Hadadezer and took them to Jerusalem. 8:8 [hgb] 大 卫 王 又 从 属 哈 大 底 谢 的 比 他 和 比 罗 他 城 中 夺 取 了 许 多 的 铜 。 [kjv] And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass. [bbe] And from Tebah and Berothai, towns of Hadadezer, King David took a great store of brass. 8:9 [hgb] 哈 马 王 陀 以 听 见 大 卫 杀 败 哈 大 底 谢 的 全 军 ， [kjv] When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, [bbe] And when Tou, king of Hamath, had news that David had overcome all the army of Hadadezer, 8:10 [hgb] 就 打 发 他 儿 子 约 兰 去 见 大 卫 王 ， 问 他 的 安 ， 为 他 祝 福 ， 因 为 他 杀 败 了 哈 大 底 谢 ， 原 来 陀 以 与 哈 大 底 谢 常 常 争 战 。 约 兰 带 了 金 银 铜 的 器 皿 来 ， [kjv] Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: [bbe] He sent his son Hadoram to David, with words of peace and blessing, because he had overcome Hadadezer in the fight, for Hadadezer had wars with Tou; and Hadoram took with him vessels of silver and gold and brass: 8:11 [hgb] 大 卫 王 将 这 些 器 皿 和 他 治 服 各 国 所 得 来 的 金 银 都 分 别 为 圣 ， 献 给 耶 和 华 ， [kjv] Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued; [bbe] These King David made holy to the Lord, together with the silver and gold which he had taken from the nations he had overcome-- 8:12 [hgb] 就 是 从 亚 兰 ， 摩 押 ， 亚 扪 ， 非 利 士 ， 亚 玛 力 人 所 得 来 的 ， 以 及 从 琐 巴 王 利 合 的 儿 子 哈 大 底 谢 所 掠 之 物 。 [kjv] Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. [bbe] The nations of Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon and the Philistines and the Amalekites and the goods he had taken from Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 8:13 [hgb] 大 卫 在 盐 谷 击 杀 了 亚 兰 （ 或 作 以 东 ， 见 诗 篇 六 十 篇 诗 题 ） 一 万 八 千 人 回 来 ， 就 得 了 大 名 。 [kjv] And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men. [bbe] And David got great honour for himself, when he came back, by the destruction of Edom in the valley of Salt, to the number of eighteen thousand men. 8:14 [hgb] 又 在 以 东 全 地 设 立 防 营 ， 以 东 人 就 都 归 服 大 卫 。 大 卫 无 论 往 哪 里 去 ， 耶 和 华 都 使 他 得 胜 。 [kjv] And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David\u0027s servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. [bbe] And he put armed forces in Edom; all through Edom he had armed forces stationed, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the Lord made David overcome wherever he went. 8:15 [hgb] 大 卫 作 以 色 列 众 人 的 王 ， 又 向 众 民 秉 公 行 义 。 [kjv] And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people. [bbe] And David was king over all Israel, judging and giving right decisions for all his people. 8:16 [hgb] 洗 鲁 雅 的 儿 子 约 押 作 元 帅 。 亚 希 律 的 儿 子 约 沙 法 作 史 官 。 [kjv] And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; [bbe] And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the army; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was keeper of the records; 8:17 [hgb] 亚 希 突 的 儿 子 撒 督 和 亚 比 亚 他 的 儿 子 亚 希 米 勒 作 祭 司 长 。 西 莱 雅 作 书 记 。 [kjv] And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe; [bbe] And Zadok and Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, were priests; and Seraiah was the scribe; 8:18 [hgb] 耶 何 耶 大 的 儿 子 比 拿 雅 统 辖 基 利 提 人 和 比 利 提 人 。 大 卫 的 众 子 都 作 领 袖 。 [kjv] And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David\u0027s sons were chief rulers.
