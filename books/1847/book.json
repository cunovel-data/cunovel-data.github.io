{"id":1847,"title":"Addicted","description":"Storyline: \n The New York Times bestseller \n Adapted into a major motion picture distributed through Lionsgate \n From the Queen of Erotica, Addicted tells the provocative story of one married woman’s struggle to deal with the fall-out of her forbidden desires. The world of Addicted is continued in the New York Times bestseller Nervous, and Zane’s highly-anticipated upcoming novel Vengeance, available May 24, 2016. \n For successful businesswoman Zoe Reynard, finding the pleasure she wants, the way she wants it, is not worth the risk of losing everything she has: a charmed marriage to her childhood sweetheart, a thriving company, and three wonderful children. But Zoe feels helpless in the grip of an overpowering addiction…to sex. \n After finding a compassionate therapist to help her, Zoe finally summons the courage to tell her torrid story, a tale of guilt and desire as shocking as it is compelling. From the sensitive artist with whom she spends stolen hours on rumpled sheets, to the rough and violent man who leads her toward destruction, Zoe is desperately searching for fulfillment—and, perhaps, something darker and deeper. \n As her life spins out of control and her sexual escapades carry her toward a dangerous fate, Zoe races to uncover the source of her “fatal attraction.” Chilling secrets tumble forth and perilous temptations build toward a climax that could threaten her sanity, her marriage…and her life.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/addicted.jpg","author":"Zane","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":54,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
