From the sensitive artist with whom she spends stolen hours on rumpled sheets, to the rough and violent man who leads her toward destruction, Zoe is desperately searching for fulfillment—and, perhaps, something darker and deeper. \n As her life spins out of control and her sexual escapades carry her toward a dangerous fate, Zoe races to uncover the source of her “fatal attraction.” Chilling secrets tumble forth and perilous temptations build toward a climax that could threaten her sanity, her marriage…and her life.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/addicted.jpg","author":"Zane","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/addicted.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM"}},{"id":77686,"no":53,"title":"Page 53","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/addicted/page-53.html","bookId":1847,"book":{"id":1847,"title":"Addicted","description":"Storyline: \n The New York Times bestseller \n Adapted into a major motion picture distributed through Lionsgate \n From the Queen of Erotica, Addicted tells the provocative story of one married woman’s struggle to deal with the fall-out of her forbidden desires.
