I wasn’t about to let that shit happen, beaten up and bruised or not. He didn’t keep me guessing long. “Making love woulddefinitelybe too physically straining. However, there is something I can do to you that wouldn’t fall into that category. Yet it would bring about the same end result.”\\n\\n I started laughing, and it made my ribs hurt for a moment. “Jason, what the hell are you talking about?”\\n\\n “Hmmmm, I can show you better than I can tell you.” And that’s exactly what he did. My previously shy, sexually repressed husband got up from the bed to lock thedoor, even though the kids had been asleep for hours, and then wasted no time getting my black lace panties off.\\n\\n “I thought you said we can’t have sex, Boo?”\\n\\n “We’re not going to have sex. At least, not sexual intercourse.” He started grinning, and I was still lost as a virgin in a whorehouse.\\n\\n That is, until he spread my legs open and started sucking on my pussy. I was likely to faint. Jason was eating my pussy, and I couldn’t hold in my surprise. “Jason, you’re eating my pussy!”\\n\\n He paused long enough to say, “Uh-huh, yes I am eating-your pussy, and it’s good too!”\\n\\n He started eating me with more and more intensity. I think the mere thought of him going down on me made me cum the first two or three times, but it didn’t stop there. My baby ate me like I was an all-you-caneatbuffet, and I had orgasm on top of orgasm. He must have been trying to make up for lost time. At one point, I had to grab a hold of the headboard just to be able to hang in there with his tongue action.\\n\\n I wanted to suck his dick so bad, and he told me it wouldn’t have been a problem if my lips weren’t so damn swollen and sore. I was madder at Dempsey for keeping me from sucking Jason’s dick than trying to kill me. We fell asleep about 1A.M.but a couple of hours later, a noise startled me awake. At first, I thought it might have been Angelique up late studying for some exams or something like that. I decided to play things safe and walked to the window facing the street to make sure the police were still out front. They were.\\n\\n Since I was already up and about, I decided to go downstairs and make a pot of blackberry tea, another one of my favorites I missed while I was in the hospital. I loved to make a pot of tea, take it out on the screened-inporch on the back of the house, and listen to the birds and other animals rustling about. I made my tea and headed outside onto the porch. As soon as I opened the patio door, I smelled something cooking and wondered who the hell would be crazy enough to be grilling at that time of the morning.\\n\\n That’s when I noticed the smoke escaping from the air holes of our gas grill.Something was cooking in my own backyard!It was pure stupidity not to go get the cops or call for Jason, but I had to see for myself. Once I unlocked the porch door leading out into the yard itself, I noticed Spot was not on his chain, and his dog house was empty. I ran barefoot over the cobblestone patio and threw the hood of the grill up. Two seconds later, my screams woke up the whole damn neighborhood.\\n\\n That shit did it! I told my mother to come get the kids and take them back to her house. I also asked Angelique to stay over at my mother’s to help Momma and Aubrey out. She was a sweetheart and quickly agreed. Besides, I don’t think she was too thrilled about staying at a house where people trespass in the backyard and grill the family pet anyway.Jason and I refused to leave our home, especially not for the likes of Dempsey’s bitch ass. I had one of the police officers escort me to a gun shop, where I purchased a .45-caliber handgun. They couldn’t really take issue with it in light of the fact that the officers positioned out front had done absolutely nothing to prevent what happened to Spot.\\n\\n We stayed in the house most of the time for the next few days. Since Jason had a drawing room, keeping up with his work was not that big of a deal. Allison cameover with some papers he needed to sign, and the bitch had the nerve to come up in my house with an attitude. While she was waiting for Jason to come downstairs to the great room, I made it perfectly clear all of the commotion had nothing to do with an affair but with the murder of my best friend. She looked at me, rolled her eyes, and muttered, “Oh!”\\n\\n I went the hell off. “You know what? I don’t owe you an explanation in the first damn place, so just do your job, let Jason sign the papers, and then get the hell out my house!”\\n\\n “Fine, then! I’ll do that!” I wasn’t going to say another word, but she went there. “One of these days, he’s going to wise up and get him arealwoman!”\\n\\n “Bitch, please!” I got loud with her ass. “Let’s get something straight! I’ve been with Jason since eighth grade and have known him even longer than that!\\n\\n His ass is not going anywhere! Don’t believe me? Just ask him!”\\n\\n She never got the opportunity, because he caught the tail end of our conversation and confirmed it. “Definitely not going anywhere!”\\n\\n He got to the bottom of the steps, put his arm around my waist, and gave me a big, juicy kiss. Even with all the things stressing us, we were acting like newlyweds again. “Allison, where are the papers I need to sign?”\\n\\n She handed him a manila folder. “Right here.” He took them, signed them, and handed them back to her. About to leave, she muttered, “Good-bye.”\\n\\n “One more thing, Allison.” She was almost to the door when she turned around to face Jason.\\n\\n “Yes, Mr. Reynard?”\\n\\n “Don’t ever talk to my wife like that again, or you will have to find employment someplace else.” He paused and then decided to drive the knife in deeper. “Without a recommendationfrom me, at that. Addressing Zoe in such a fashion is not professional, and it won’t be tolerated. You understand?”\\n\\n “Yes, I understand.” She looked like she was about to cry when she went out of the door. I giggled with delight; that’s what the bitch deserved.\\n\\n I had my secretary bring all the important papers that couldn’t wait over to the house for me as well. Fortunately, Shane and I had no beef, so her visits were pleasant. If anything, she was too concerned about my health and welfare. I appreciated it and gave her a bonus for working overtime and making the runs back and forth to the house.\\n\\n The sex between Jason and I was nothing short of the bomb! The kids were gone, we were there in the house together around the clock, and we made good use of the time alone. Once the swelling went down around my mouth, I wasted no time putting my lips to his dick and going to work. In fact, you might say I got a bit obsessed. Jason had to almost put my ass on a dick-feeding schedule just so he could get any work done.\\n\\n However, he loved performing oral sex just as much as I did. He became a littleoverattentive to exploring my pussy with his mouth. It was all good though! We took advantage of every possible moment. We fucked all over the house, like teenagers. We did all the freaky shit we didn’t have the nerve to do when we were younger. We utilized everything from his drafting table and the kitchen countertop to the hearth of the fireplace and the top of the washing machine during the rinse cycle.\\n\\n I was lying between Jason’s legs on the couch and sucking his dick while he was watching the late, late news about a week after Dempsey’s attack on my life when the top news report caught my attention. I heard the newscastermention a shoot-out at a nightclub called the Zoo and stopped sucking Jason’s dick so I could pay attention to the rest of the story. Apparently a scuffle had broken out over a woman, and a gun battle had ensued. “Jason, that’s the club where Brina met Dempsey!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n He whispered, “Really?” and tried to maneuver my head back down toward his dick so I could finish what I started. Shootings were so common that one at a club didn’t impress him much.\\n\\n I went back to sucking his dick and caught a rhythm, but I was still listening to the news. The reporter that was covering the scene live informed us that the police had confirmed three dead and seven injured. I thought to myself that one of the dead might be Dempsey, but decided I couldn’t be that lucky; he wouldn’t be stupid enough to go back there after I specifically told the police he hung out there.\\n\\n Jason had just cum in my mouth when the phone rang. He answered and kept saying, “Yes!” over and over again. I looked up at him, with his juices still trickling down my chin and tried to judge what the call might be about from the expression on his face.\\n\\n He replaced the phone back on the cradle. “That was Detective Wilson.” I closed my eyes and prayed Jason was about to say what he ultimately did. “It’s all over, Zoe! Dempsey’s dead!”\\n\\n chapterthirty-four\\n\\n It was such a relief to have it all behind us. I’m not the type to wish death on anyone, but I have to admit I wasn’t the least bit upset when Dempsey was shot and killed at the Zoo. Personally, I felt a quick death, albeit a violent one, was too good for him after what he did to Brina. My only regret was that two other people died along with him, and one girl who was too young to be in the club in the first place, an innocent bystander who was shot in the spine, would never be able to walk again. I found out her name from Detective Wilson and which hospital she had been taken to. I went to visit her, since I could move about freely again. The police protection had been pulled, and it was great to be out and about, even if it meant getting thrown a bit off my dick-feeding schedule. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/addicted/page-50.html","bookId":1847,"book":{"id":1847,"title":"Addicted","description":"Storyline: The New York Times bestseller \\n Adapted into a major motion picture distributed through Lionsgate \\n From the Queen of Erotica, Addicted tells the provocative story of one married woman’s struggle to deal with the fall-out of her forbidden desires.
