{"id":96863,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"The troopers lifted the litter, and Paul\u0027s eyes opened the smallest fraction - dark slits staring at her. He mustn\u0027t try the Voice! she prayed. The deaf guard! Paul\u0027s eyes closed. He had been practicing the awareness-breathing, calming his mind, listening to their captors. The deaf one posed a problem, but Paul contained his despair. The mind-calming Bene Gesserit regimen his mother had taught him kept him poised, ready to expand any opportunity. Paul allowed himself another slit-eyed inspection of his mother\u0027s face. She appeared unharmed. Gagged, though. He wondered who could\u0027ve captured her. His own captivity was plain enough - to bed with a capsule prescribed by Yueh, awaking to find himself bound to this litter. Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her. Logic said the traitor was Yueh, but he held final decision in abeyance. There was no understanding it - a Suk doctor a traitor. The litter tipped slightly as the Harkonnen troopers maneuvered it through a doorway into starlit night. A suspensor-buoy rasped against the doorway. Then they were on sand, feet grating in it. A \u0027thopter wing loomed overhead, blotting the stars. The litter settled to the ground. Paul\u0027s eyes adjusted to the faint light. He recognized the deaf trooper as the man who opened the \u0027thopter door, peered inside at the green gloom illuminated by the instrument panel. \"This the \u0027thopter we\u0027re supposed to use?\" he asked, and turned to watch his companion\u0027s lips. \"It\u0027s the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work,\" the other said. Scarface nodded. \"But it\u0027s one of them little liaison jobs. Ain\u0027t room in there for more\u0027n them an\u0027 two of us.\" \"Two\u0027s enough,\" said the litter-bearer, moving up close and presenting his lips for reading. \"We can take care of it from here on, Kinet.\" \"The Baron he told me to make sure what happened to them two,\" Scarface said. \"What you so worried about?\" asked another trooper from behind the litter-bearer. \"She is a Bene Gesserit witch,\" the deaf one said. \"They have powers.\" \"Ah-h-h . . .\" The litter-bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear. \"One of them, eh? Know whatcha mean.\" The trooper behind him grunted. \"She\u0027ll be worm meat soon enough. Don\u0027t suppose even a Bene Gesserit witch has powers over one of them big worms. Eh, Czigo?\" He nudged the litter-bearer. \"Yee-up,\" the litter-bearer said. He returned to the litter, took Jessica\u0027s shoulders. \"C\u0027mon, Kinet. You can go along if you wants to make sure what happens.\" \"It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo,\" Scarface said. Jessica felt herself lifted, the wing shadow spinning - stars. She was pushed into the rear of the \u0027thopter, her krimskell fiber bindings examined, and she was strapped down. Paul was jammed in beside her, strapped securely, and she noted his bonds were simple rope. Scarface, the deaf one they called Kinet, took his place in front. The litter-bearer, the one they called Czigo, came around and took the other front seat. Kinet closed his door, bent to the controls. The \u0027thopter took off in a wing-tucked surge, headed south over the Shield Wall. Czigo tapped his companion\u0027s shoulder, said: \"Whyn\u0027t you turn around and keep an eye on them two?\" \"Sure you know the way to go?\" Kinet watched Czigo\u0027s lips. \"I listened to the traitor same\u0027s you.\" Kinet swiveled his seat. Jessica saw the glint of starlight on a lasgun in his hand. The \u0027thopter\u0027s light-walled interior seemed to collect illumination as her eyes adjusted, but the guard\u0027s scarred face remained dim. Jessica tested her seat belt, found it loose. She felt roughness in the strap against her left arm, realized the strap had been almost severed, would snap at a sudden jerk. Has someone been at this \u0027thopter, preparing it for us? she wondered. Who? Slowly, she twisted her bound feet clear of Paul\u0027s. \"Sure do seem a shame to waste a good-looking woman like this,\" Scarface said. \"You ever have any highborn types?\" He turned to look at the pilot. \"Bene Gesserit ain\u0027t all highborn,\" the pilot said. \"But they all looks heighty.\" He can see me plain enough , Jessica thought. She brought her bound legs up onto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, staring at Scarface. \"Real pretty, she is,\" Kinet said. He wet his lips with his tongue. \"Sure do seem a shame.\" He looked at Czigo. \"You thinking what I think you\u0027re thinking?\" the pilot asked. \"Who\u0027d be to know?\" the guard asked. \"Afterwards . . . \" He shrugged. \"I just never had me no highborns. Might never get a chance like this one again.\" \"You lay a hand on my mother . . . \" Paul grated. He glared at Scarface. \"Hey!\" the pilot laughed. \"Cub\u0027s got a bark. Ain\u0027t got no bite, though.\" And Jessica thought; Paul\u0027s pitching his voice too high. It may work, though . They flew on in silence. These poor fools , Jessica thought, studying her guards and reviewing the Baron\u0027s words. They\u0027ll be killed as soon as they report success on their mission. The Baron wants no witnesses . The \u0027thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and Jessica saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them. \"This oughta be far enough,\" the pilot said. \"The traitor said to put\u0027em on the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall.\" He dipped the craft toward the dunes in a long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over the desert surface. Jessica saw Paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming exercise. He closed his eyes, opened them. Jessica stared, helpless to aid him. He hasn\u0027t mastered the Voice yet , she thought, if he fails . . . The \u0027thopter touched sand with a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking north back across the Shield Wall, saw a shadow of wings settle out of sight up there. Someone\u0027s following us! she thought. Who? Then: The ones the Baron set to watch this pair. And there\u0027ll be watchers for the watchers, too . Czigo shut off his wing rotors. Silence flooded in upon them. Jessica turned her head. She could see out the window beyond Scarface a dim glow of light from a rising moon, a frosted rim of rock rising from the desert. Sandblast ridges streaked its sides. Paul cleared his throat. The pilot said: \"Now, Kinet?\" \"I dunno, Czigo.\" Czigo turned, said: \"Ah-h-h, look.\" He reached out for Jessica\u0027s skirt. \"Remove her gag,\" Paul commanded. Jessica felt the words rolling in the air. The tone, the timbre excellent - imperative, very sharp. A slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this man\u0027s spectrum. Czigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessica\u0027s mouth, slipped the knot on the gag. \"Stop that!\" Kinet ordered. \"Ah, shut your trap,\" Czigo said. \"Her hands\u0027re tied.\" He freed the knot and the binding dropped. His eyes glittered as he studied Jessica. Kinet put a hand on the pilot\u0027s arm. \"Look, Czigo, no need to . . . \" Jessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched her voice in low, intimate tones. \"Gentlemen! No need to fight over me.\" At the same time, she writhed sinuously for Kinet\u0027s benefit. She saw them grow tense, knowing that in this instant they were convinced of the need to fight over her. Their disagreement required no other reason. In their minds, they were fighting over her. She held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure Kinet would read her lips, said: \"You mustn\u0027t disagree.\" They drew farther apart, glanced warily at each other. \"Is any woman worth fighting over?\" she asked. By uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth their fighting. Paul clamped his lips tightly closed, forced himself to be silent. There had been the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice. Now - everything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own. \"Yeah,\" Scarface said. \"No need to fight over . . . \" His hand flashed toward the pilot\u0027s neck. The blow was met by a splash of metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet\u0027s chest. Scarface groaned, sagged backward against his door. \"Thought I was some dummy didn\u0027t know that trick,\" Czigo said. He brought back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight. \"Now for the cub,\" he said and leaned toward Paul. \"No need for that,\" Jessica murmured. Czigo hesitated. \"Wouldn\u0027t you rather have me cooperative?\" Jessica asked. \"Give the boy a chance.\" Her lip curled in a sneer. \"Little enough chance he\u0027d have out there in that sand. Give him that and . . . \" She smiled. \"You could find yourself well rewarded.\" Czigo glanced left, right, returned his attention to Jessica. \"I\u0027ve heard what can happen to a man in this desert,\" he said. \"Boy might find the knife a kindness.\" \"Is it so much I ask?\" Jessica pleaded. \"You\u0027re trying to trick me,\" Czigo muttered. \"I don\u0027t want to see my son die,\" Jessica said. \"Is that a trick?\" Czigo moved back, elbowed the door latch. He grabbed Paul, dragged him across the seat, pushed him half out the door and held the knife posed. \"What\u0027ll y\u0027 do, cub, if I cut y\u0027r bonds?\" \"He\u0027ll leave here immediately and head for those rocks,\" Jessica said. \"Is that what y\u0027ll do, cub?\" Czigo asked. Paul\u0027s voice was properly surly. \"Yes.\" The knife moved down, slashed the bindings of his legs. Paul felt the hand on his back to hurl him down onto the sand, feigned a lurch against the doorframe for purchase, turned as though to catch himself, lashed out with his right foot. The toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of training, as though all of that training focused on this instant. Almost every muscle of his body cooperated in the placement of it. The tip struck the soft part of Czigo\u0027s abdomen just below the sternum, slammed upward with terrible force over the liver and through the diaphragm to crush the right ventricle of the man\u0027s heart. With one gurgling scream, the guard jerked backward across the seats. Paul, unable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand, landing with a roll that took up the force and brought him back to his feet in one motion. He dove back into the cabin, found the knife and held it in his teeth while his mother sawed her bonds. She took the blade and freed his hands. \"I could\u0027ve handled him,\" she said. \"He\u0027d have had to cut my bindings. That was a foolish risk.\" \"I saw the opening and used it,\" he said. She heard the harsh control in his voice, said: \"Yueh\u0027s house sign is scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin.\" He looked up, saw the curling symbol. \"Get out and let us study this craft,\" she said. \"There\u0027s a bundle under the pilot\u0027s seat. I felt it when we got in.\" \"Bomb?\" \"Doubt it. There\u0027s something peculiar here.\" Paul leaped out to the sand and Jessica followed. She turned, reached under the seat for the strange bundle, seeing Czigo\u0027s feet close to her face, feeling dampness on the bundle as she removed it, realizing the dampness was the pilot\u0027s blood. Waste of moisture , she thought, knowing that this was Arrakeen thinking. Paul stared around them, saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert like a beach rising from the sea, wind-carved palisades beyond. He turned back as his mother lifted the bundle from the \u0027thopter, saw her stare across the dunes toward the Shield Wall. He looked to see what drew her attention, saw another \u0027thopter swooping toward them, realized they\u0027d not have time to clear the bodies out of this \u0027thopter and escape. \"Run, Paul!\" Jessica shouted. \"It\u0027s Harkonnens!\" Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife - chopping off what\u0027s incomplete and saying: \"Now, it\u0027s complete because it\u0027s ended here.\" - from \"Collected Sayings of, Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan A man in Harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at the end of the hall, stared in at Yueh, taking in at a single glance Mapes\u0027 body, the sprawled form of the Duke, Yueh standing there. The man held a lasgun in his right hand. There was a casual air of brutality about him, a sense of toughness and poise that sent a shiver through Yueh. Sardaukar, Yueh thought. A Bashar by the look of him. Probably one of the Emperor\u0027s own sent here to keep an eye on things. No matter what the uniform, there\u0027s no disguising them . \"You\u0027re Yueh,\" the man said. He looked speculatively at the Suk School ring on the Doctor\u0027s hair, stared once at the diamond tattoo and then met Yueh\u0027s eyes. \"I am Yueh,\" the Doctor said. \"You can relax, Yueh,\" the man said. \"When you dropped the house shields we came right in. Everything\u0027s under control here. Is this the Duke?\" \"This is the Duke.\" \"Dead?\" \"Merely unconscious. I suggest you tie him.\" \"Did you do for these others?\" He glanced back down the hall where Mapes\u0027 body lay. \"More\u0027s the pity,\" Yueh muttered. \"Pity!\" the Sardaukar sneered. He advanced, looked down at Leto. \"So that\u0027s the great Red Duke.\" If I had doubts about what this man is, that would end them , Yueh thought. Only the Emperor calls the Atreides the Red Duke . The Sardaukar reached down, cut the red hawk insignia from Leto\u0027s uniform. \"Little souvenir,\" he said. \"Where\u0027s the ducal signet ring?\" \"He doesn\u0027t have it on him,\" Yueh said. \"I can see that!\" the Sardaukar snapped. Yueh stiffened, swallowed. If they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, they\u0027ll find out about the ring, about the \u0027thopter I prepared - all will fail . \"Sometimes the Duke sent the ring with a messenger as surety that an order came directly from him,\" Yueh said. \"Must be damned trusted messengers,\" the Sardaukar muttered. \"Aren\u0027t you going to tie him?\" Yueh ventured. \"How long\u0027ll he be unconscious?\" \"Two hours or so. I wasn\u0027t as precise with his dosage as I was for the woman and boy.\" The Sardaukar spurned the Duke with his toe. \"This was nothing to fear even when awake. When will the woman and boy awaken?\" \"About ten minutes.\" \"So soon?\" \"I was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men.\" \"So he will. You\u0027ll wait outside, Yueh.\" He shot a hard glance at Yueh. \"Now!\" Yueh glanced at Leto. \"What about . . . \" \"He\u0027ll be delivered to the Baron all properly trussed like a roast for the oven.\" Again, the Sardaukar looked at the diamond tattoo on Yueh\u0027s forehead. \"You\u0027re known; you\u0027ll be safe enough in the halls. We\u0027ve no more time for chit-chat, traitor. I hear the others coming.\" Traitor , Yueh thought. He lowered his gaze, pressed past the Sardaukar, knowing this as a foretaste of how history would remember him: Yueh the traitor . He passed more bodies on his way to the front entrance and glanced at them, fearful that one might be Paul or Jessica. All were house troopers or wore Harkonnen uniform. Harkonnen guards came alert, staring at him as he emerged from the front entrance into flame-lighted night. The palms along the road had been fired to illuminate the house. Black smoke from the flammables used to ignite the trees poured upward through orange flames. \"It\u0027s the traitor,\" someone said. \"The Baron will want to see you soon,\" another said. I must get to the \u0027thopter , Yueh thought. I must put the ducal signet where Paul will find it . And fear struck him: If Idaho suspects me or grows impatient - if he doesn\u0027t wait and go exactly where I told him - Jessica and Paul will not be saved from the carnage. I\u0027ll be denied even the smallest relief from my act . The Harkonnen guard released his arm, said \"Wait over there out of the way.\" Abruptly, Yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction, spared nothing, given not the smallest pity. Idahomust not fail! Another guard bumped into him, barked: \"Stay out of the way, you!\" Even when they\u0027ve profited by me they despise me . Yueh thought. He straightened himself as he was pushed aside, regained some of his dignity. \"Wait for the Baron!\" a guard officer snarled. Yueh nodded, walked with controlled casualness along the front of the house, turned the corner into shadows out of sight of the burning palms. Quickly, every step betraying his anxiety, Yueh made for the rear yard beneath the conservatory where the \u0027thopter waited - the craft they had placed there to carry away Paul and his mother. A guard stood at the open rear door of the house, his attention focused on the lighted hall and men banging through there, searching from room to room. How confident they were! Yueh hugged the shadows, worked his way around the \u0027thopter, eased open the door on the side away from the guard. He felt under the front seats for the Fremkit he had hidden there, lifted a flap and slipped in the ducal signet. He felt the crinkling of the spice paper there, the note he had written, pressed the ring into the paper. He removed his hand, resealed the pack. Softly, Yueh closed the \u0027thopter door, worked his way back to the corner of the house and around toward the flaming trees. Now, it is done , he thought. Once more, he emerged into the light of the blazing palms. He pulled his cloak around him, stared at the flames. Soon I will know. Soon I will see the Baron and I will know. And the Baron - he will encounter a small tooth . There is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan. - the Princess Irulan: \"Introduction to A Child\u0027s History of Muad\u0027Dib\" The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport of the grounded lighter he was using as a command post. Out the port he saw the flame-lighted night of Arrakeen. His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall where his secret weapon was doing its work. Explosive artillery. The guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke\u0027s fighting men had retreated for a last-ditch stand. Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock and dust in the brief illumination - and the Duke\u0027s men were being sealed off to die by starvation, caught like animals in their burrows. The Baron could feel the distant chomping - a drumbeat carried to him through the ship\u0027s metal: broomp . . . broomp . Then: BROOMP-broomp! Who would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields? The thought was a chuckle in his mind. But it was predictable the Duke\u0027s men would run for those caves. And the Emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the lives of our mutual force . He adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against the pull of gravity. A smile creased his mouth, pulled at the lines of his jowls. A pity to waste such fighting men as the Duke\u0027s , he thought. He smiled more broadly, laughing at himself. Pity should be cruel! He nodded. Failure was, by definition, expendable. The whole universe sat there, open to the man who could make the right decisions. The uncertain rabbits had to be exposed, made to run for their burrows. Else how could you control them and breed them? He pictured his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits. And he thought: The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you . A door opened behind him. The Baron studied the reflection in the night-blackened viewport before turning. Piter de Vries advanced into the chamber followed by Umman Kudu, the captain of the Baron\u0027s personal guard. There was a motion of men just outside the door, the mutton faces of his guard, their expressions carefully sheep-like in his presence. The Baron turned. Piter touched finger to forelock in his mocking salute. \"Good news, m\u0027Lord. The Sardaukar have brought in the Duke.\" \"Of course they have,\" the Baron rumbled. He studied the somber mask of villainy on Piter\u0027s effeminate face. And the eyes: those shaded slits of bluest blue-in-blue. Soon I must remove him , the Baron thought. He has almost outlasted his usefulness, almost reached the point of positive danger to my person. First, though, he must make the people of Arrakis hate him. Then - they will welcome my darling Feyd-Rautha as a savior . The Baron shifted his attention to the guard captain - Umman Kudu: scissors-line of jaw muscles, chin like a boot toe - a man to be trusted because the captain\u0027s vices were known. \"First, where is the traitor who gave me the Duke?\" the Baron asked. \"I must give the traitor his reward.\" Piter turned on one toe, motioned to the guard outside. A bit of black movement there and Yueh walked through. His motions were stiff and stringy. The mustache drooped beside his purple lips. Only the old eyes seemed alive. Yueh came to a stop three paces into the room, obeying a motion from Piter, and stood there staring across the open space at the Baron. \"Ah-h-h, Dr. Yueh.\" \"M\u0027Lord Harkonnen.\" \"You\u0027ve given us the Duke, I hear.\" \"My half of the bargain, m\u0027Lord.\" The Baron looked at Piter. Piter nodded. The Baron looked back at Yueh. \"The letter of the bargain, eh? And I . . .\" He spat the words out: \"What was I to do in return?\" \"You remember quite well, m\u0027Lord Harkonnen.\" And Yueh allowed himself to think now, hearing the loud silence of clocks in his mind. He had seen the subtle betrayals in the Baron\u0027s manner. Wanna was indeed dead - gone far beyond their reach. Otherwise, there\u0027d still be a hold on the weak doctor. The Baron\u0027s manner showed there was no hold; it was ended. \"Do I?\" the Baron asked. \"You promised to deliver my Wanna from her agony.\" The Baron nodded. \"Oh, yes. Now, I remember. So I did. That was my promise. That was how we bent the Imperial Conditioning. You couldn\u0027t endure seeing your Bene Gesserit witch grovel in Piter\u0027s pain amplifiers. Well, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen always keeps his promises. I told you I\u0027d free her from the agony and permit you to join her. So be it.\" He waved a hand at Piter. Piter\u0027s blue eyes took a glazed look. His movement was catlike in its sudden fluidity. The knife in his hand glistened like a claw as it flashed into Yueh\u0027s back. The old man stiffened, never taking his attention from the Baron. \"So join her!\" the Baron spat. Yueh stood, swaying. His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice came in oddly measured cadence: \"You . . . think . . . you . . . de . . . feated . . . me. You . . . think . . . I . . . did . . . not . . . know . . . what . . . I . . . bought . . . for . . . my . . . Wanna.\" He toppled. No bending or softening. It was like a tree falling. \"So join her,\" the Baron repeated. But his words were like a weak echo. Yueh had filled him with a sense of foreboding. He whipped his attention to Piter, watched the man wipe the blade on a scrap of cloth, watched the creamy look of satisfaction in the blue eyes. So that\u0027s how he kills by his own hand , the Baron thought. It\u0027s well to know . \"He did give us the Duke?\" the Baron asked. \"Of a certainty, my Lord,\" Piter said. \"Then get him in here!\" Piter glanced at the guard captain, who whirled to obey. The Baron looked down at Yueh. From the way the man had fallen, you could suspect oak in him instead of bones. \"I never could bring myself to trust a traitor,\" the Baron said. \"Not even a traitor I created.\" He glanced at the night-shrouded viewport. That black bag of stillness out there was his, the Baron knew. There was no more crump of artillery against the Shield Wall caves; the burrow traps were sealed off. Quite suddenly, the Baron\u0027s mind could conceive of nothing more beautiful than that utter emptiness of black. Unless it were white on the black. Plated white on the black. Porcelain white. But there was still the feeling of doubt. What had the old fool of a doctor meant? Of course, he\u0027d probably known what would happen to him in the end. But that bit about thinking he\u0027d been defeated: \"You think you defeated me .\" What had he meant? The Duke Leto Atreides came through the door. His arms were bound in chains, the eagle face streaked with dirt. His uniform was torn where someone had ripped off his insignia. There were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been removed without first freeing the uniform ties. The Duke\u0027s eyes held a glazed, insane look. \"Wel-l-l-l,\" the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He knew he had spoken too loudly. This moment, long envisioned, had lost some of its savor. Damn that cursed doctor through all eternity! \"I believe the good Duke is drugged,\" Piter said. \"That\u0027s how Yueh caught him for us.\" Piter turned to the Duke. \"Aren\u0027t you drugged, my dear Duke?\" The voice was far away. Leto could feel the chains, the ache of muscles, his cracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in his mouth. But sounds were dull, hidden by a cottony blanket. And he saw only dim shapes through the blanket. \"What of the woman and the boy, Piter?\" the Baron asked. \"Any word yet?\" Piter\u0027s tongue darted over his lips. \"You\u0027ve heard something!\" the Baron snapped. \"What?\" Piter glanced at the guard captain, back to the Baron. \"The men who were sent to do the job, m\u0027Lord-they\u0027ve . . . ah . . . been . . . ah . . . found.\" \"Well, they report everything satisfactory?\" \"They\u0027re dead, m\u0027Lord.\" \"Of course they are! What I want to know is - \" \"They were dead when found, m\u0027Lord.\" The Baron\u0027s face went livid. \"And the woman and boy?\" \"No sign, m\u0027Lord, but there was a worm. It came while the scene was being investigated. Perhaps it\u0027s as we wished - an accident. Possibly - \" \"We do not deal in possibilities, Piter. What of the missing \u0027thopter? Does that suggest anything to my Mentat?\" \"One of the Duke\u0027s men obviously escaped in it, m\u0027Lord. Killed our pilot and escaped.\" \"Which of the Duke\u0027s men?\" \"It was a clean, silent killing, m\u0027Lord. Hawat, perhaps, or that Halleck one. Possibly Idaho . Or any top lieutenant.\" \"Possibilities,\" the Baron muttered. He glanced at the swaying, drugged figure of the Duke. \"The situation is in hand, m\u0027Lord,\" Piter said. \"No, it isn\u0027t! Where is that stupid planetologist? Where is this man Kynes?\" \"We\u0027ve word where to find him and he\u0027s been sent for, m\u0027Lord.\" \"I don\u0027t like the way the Emperor\u0027s servant is helping us,\" the Baron muttered. They were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in Leto\u0027s mind. Woman and boy - no sign . Paul and Jessica had escaped. And the fate of Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still hope. \"Where is the ducal signet ring?\" the Baron demanded. \"His finger is bare.\" \"The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord,\" the guard captain said. \"You killed the doctor too soon,\" the Baron said. \"That was a mistake. You should\u0027ve warned me, Piter. You moved too precipitately for the good of our enterprise.\" He scowled. \"Possibilities!\" The thought hung like a sine wave in Leto\u0027s mind: Paul and Jessica have escaped! And there was something else in his memory: a bargain. He could almost remember it. The tooth! He remembered part of it now: a pill of poison gas shaped into a false tooth . Someone had told him to remember the tooth. The tooth was in his mouth. He could feel its shape with his tongue. All he had to do was bite sharply on it. Not yet! The someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron. Who had told him? He couldn\u0027t remember. \"How long will he remain drugged like this?\" the Baron asked. \"Perhaps another hour, m\u0027Lord.\" \"Perhaps,\" the Baron muttered. Again, he turned to the night-blackened window. \"I am hungry.\" That\u0027s the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there , Leto thought. The shape danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room. And the room expanded and contracted. It grew brighter and darker. It folded into blackness and faded. Time became a sequence of layers for the Duke. He drifted up through them. I must wait . There was a table. Leto saw the table quite clearly. And a gross, fat man on the other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of him. Leto felt himself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt the chains, the straps that held his tingling body in the chair. He was aware there had been a passage of time, but its length escaped him. \"I believe he\u0027s coming around. Baron.\" A silky voice, that one. That was Piter. \"So I see, Piter.\" A rumbling basso: the Baron . Leto sensed increasing definition in his surroundings. The chair beneath him took on firmness, the bindings were sharper. And he saw the Baron clearly now. Leto watched the movements of the man\u0027s hands: compulsive touchings - the edge of a plate, the handle of a spoon, a finger tracing the fold of a jowl. Leto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it. \"You can hear me, Duke Leto,\" the Baron said. \"I know you can hear me. We want to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you sired on her.\" No sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him. It\u0027s true, then: they don\u0027t have Paul and Jessica . \"This is not a child\u0027s game we play,\" the Baron rumbled. \"You must know that.\" He leaned toward Leto, studying the face. It pained the Baron that this could not be handled privately, just between the two of them. To have others see royalty in such straits - it set a bad precedent. Leto could feel strength returning. And now, the memory of the false tooth stood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape. The nerve-shaped capsule within that tooth - the poison gas - he remembered who had put the deadly weapon in his mouth. Yueh . Drug-fogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room hung like a vapor in Leto\u0027s mind. He knew it had been Yueh. \"Do you hear that noise, Duke Leto?\" the Baron asked. Leto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someone\u0027s agony. \"We caught one of your men disguised as a Fremen, \" the Baron said. \"We penetrated the disguise quite easily: the eyes, you know. He insists he was sent among the Fremen to spy on them. I\u0027ve lived for a time on this planet, cher cousin. One does not spy on those ragged scum of the desert. Tell me, did you buy their help? Did you send your woman and son to them?\" Leto felt fear tighten his chest. If Yueh sent them to the desert fold . . . the search won\u0027t stop until they \u0027re found . \"Come, come,\" the Baron said. \"We don\u0027t have much time and pain is quick. Please don\u0027t bring it to this, my dear Duke.\" The Baron looked up at Piter who stood at Leto\u0027s shoulder. \"Piter doesn\u0027t have all his tools here, but I\u0027m sure he could improvise.\" \"Improvisation is sometimes the best, Baron.\" That silky, insinuating voice! Leto heard it at his ear. \"You had an emergency plan,\" the Baron said. \"Where have your woman and the boy been sent?\" He looked at Leto\u0027s hand. \"Your ring is missing. Does the boy have it?\" The Baron looked up, stared into Leto\u0027s eyes. \"You don\u0027t answer,\" he said. \"Will you force me to do a thing I do not want to do? Piter will use simple, direct methods. I agree they\u0027re sometimes the best, but it\u0027s not good that you should be subjected to such things.\" \"Hot tallow on the back, perhaps, or on the eyelids,\" Piter said. \"Perhaps on other portions of the body. It\u0027s especially effective when the subject doesn\u0027t know where the tallow will fall next. It\u0027s a good method and there\u0027s a sort of beauty in the pattern of pus-white blisters on naked skin, eh, Baron?\" \"Exquisite,\" the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour. Those touching fingers! Leto watched the fat hands, the glittering jewels on baby-fat hands - their compulsive wandering. The sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Duke\u0027s nerves. Who is it they caught? he wondered. Could it have been Idaho ? \"Believe me, cher cousin,\" the Baron said. \"I do not want it to come to this.\" \"You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come,\" Piter said. \"There\u0027s an artistry in this, you know.\" \"You\u0027re a superb artist,\" the Baron growled. \"Now, have the decency to be silent.\" Leto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had said once, seeing a picture of the Baron: \" \u0027And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea . . . and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .\u0027 \" \"We waste time, Baron,\" Piter said. \"Perhaps.\" The Baron nodded. \"You know, my dear Leto, you\u0027ll tell us in the end where they are. There\u0027s a level of pain that\u0027ll buy you.\" He\u0027s most likely correct , Leto thought. Were if not for the tooth . . . and the fact that I truly don\u0027t know where they are . The Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth, chewed slowly, swallowed. We must try a new tack , he thought.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dune-dune-chronicles-1/page-11.html","bookId":2153,"book":{"id":2153,"title":"Dune (Dune Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Dune (Dune Chronicles #1) Set in the far future amidst a sprawling feudal interstellar empire where planetary dynasties are controlled by noble houses that owe an allegiance to the imperial House Corrino, Dune tells the story of young Paul Atreides (the heir apparent to Duke Leto Atreides and heir of House Atreides) as he and his family accept control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the \"spice\" melange, the most important and valuable substance in the universe.
