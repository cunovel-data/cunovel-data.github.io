{"id":101065,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Some of Hawat\u0027s men stirred, whispering.\n \"Remain silent as frightened animals,\" the Fremen hissed.\n Hawat discerned movement near the opposite cliff - flitting blurs of tan on tan.\n \"My little friend carried his message,\" the Fremen said. \"He is a good messenger - day or night. I\u0027ll be unhappy to lose that one.\"\n The movement across the sink faded away. On the entire four to five kilometer expanse of sand nothing remained but the growing pressure of the day\u0027s heat - blurred columns of rising air.\n \"Be most silent now,\" the Fremen whispered.\n A file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff, headed directly across the sink. To Hawat, they appeared to be Fremen, but a curiously inept band. He counted six men making heavy going of it over the dunes.\n A \"thwok-thwok\" of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind Hawat\u0027s group. The craft came over the cliff wall above them - an Atreides \u0027thopter with Harkonnen battle colors splashed on it. The \u0027thopter swooped toward the men crossing the sink.\n The group there stopped on a dune crest, waved.\n The \u0027thopter circled once over them in a tight curve, came back for a dust-shrouded landing in front of the Fremen. Five men swarmed from the \u0027thopter and Hawat saw the dust-repellent shimmering of shields and, in their motions, the hard competence of Sardaukar.\n \"Aiihh! They use their stupid shields,\" the Fremen beside Hawat hissed. He glanced toward the open south wall of the sink.\n \"They are Sardaukar,\" Hawat whispered.\n \"Good.\"\n The Sardaukar approached the waiting group of Fremen in an enclosing half-circle. Sun glinted on blades held ready. The Fremen stood in a compact group, apparently indifferent.\n Abruptly, the sand around the two groups sprouted Fremen. They were at the ornithopter, then in it. Where the two groups had met at the dune crest, a dust cloud partly obscured violent motion.\n Presently, dust settled. Only Fremen remained standing.\n \"They left only three men in their \u0027thopter,\" the Fremen beside Hawat said. \"That was fortunate. I don\u0027t believe we had to damage the craft in taking it.\"\n Behind Hawat, one of his men whispered: \"Those were Sardaukar!\"\n \"Did you notice how well they fought?\" the Fremen asked.\n Hawat took a deep breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: \"Yes, they fought well, indeed.\"\n The captured \u0027thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.\n So these Fremen can handle \u0027thopters, too , Hawat thought.\n On the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once . . . twice.\n \"More come!\" the Fremen beside Hawat barked. \"Be ready. I\u0027d hoped to have us away without more inconvenience.\"\n Inconvenience! Hawat thought.\n He saw two more \u0027thopters swooping from high in the west onto an area of sand suddenly devoid of visible Fremen. Only eight splotches of blue - the bodies of the Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniforms - remained at the scene of violence.\n Another \u0027thopter glided in over the cliff wall above Hawat. He drew in a sharp breath as he saw it - a big troop carrier. It flew with the slow, spread-wing heaviness of a full load - like a giant bird coming to its nest.\n In the distance, the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of the diving \u0027thopters. It laced across the sand, raising a sharp trail of dust.\n \"The cowards!\" the Fremen beside Hawat rasped.\n The troop carrier settled toward the patch of blue-clad bodies. Its wings crept out to full reach, began the cupping action of a quick stop.\n Hawat\u0027s attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south, a \u0027thopter plummeting there in a power dive, wings folded flat against its sides, its jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the sky. It plunged like an arrow toward the troop carrier which was unshielded because of the lasgun activity around it. Straight into the carrier the diving \u0027thopter plunged.\n A flaming roar shook the basin. Rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all around. A geyser of red-orange shot skyward from the sand where the carrier and its companion \u0027thopters had been - everything there caught in the flame.\n It was the Fremen who took off in that captured \u0027thopter , Hawat thought. He deliberately sacrificed himself to get that carrier. Great Mother! What are these Fremen?\n \"A reasonable exchange,\" said the Fremen beside Hawat. \"There must\u0027ve been three hundred men in that carrier. Now, we must see to their water and make plans to get another aircraft.\" He started to step out of their rock-shadowed concealment.\n A rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him, falling in low-suspensor slowness. In the flashing instant, Hawat had time to see that they were Sardaukar, hard faces set in battle frenzy, that they were unshielded and each carried a knife in one hand, a stunner in the other.\n A thrown knife caught Hawat\u0027s Fremen companion in the throat, hurling him backward, twisting face down. Hawat had only time to draw his own knife before blackness of a stunner projectile felled him.\n Muad\u0027Dib could indeed, see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad\u0027Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us \"The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.\" And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning \"That path leads ever down into stagnation.\"\n - from \"Arrakis Awakening\" by the Princess Irulan\n As the ornithopters glided out of the night above them, Paul grabbed his mother\u0027s arm, snapped: \"Don\u0027t move!\"\n Then he saw the lead craft in the moonlight, the way its wings cupped to brake for landing, the reckless dash of the hands at the controls.\n \"It\u0027s Idaho ,\" he breathed.\n The craft and its companions settled into the basin like a covey of birds coming to nest. Idaho was out of his \u0027thopter and running toward them before the dust settled. Two figures in Fremen robes followed him. Paul recognized one: the tall, sandy-bearded Kynes.\n \"This way!\" Kynes called and he veered left.\n Behind Kynes, other Fremen were throwing fabric covers over their ornithopters. The craft became a row of shallow dunes.\n Idaho skidded to a stop in front of Paul, saluted. \"M\u0027Lord, the Fremen have a temporary hiding place nearby where we - \"\n \"What about that back there?\"\n Paul pointed to the violence above the distant cliff - the jetflares, the purple beams of lasguns lacing the desert.\n A rare smile touched Idaho \u0027s round, placid face. \"M\u0027Lord . . . Sire, I\u0027ve left them a little sur - \"\n Glaring white light filled the desert - bright as a sun, etching their shadows onto the rock floor of the ledge. In one sweeping motion, Idaho had Paul\u0027s arm in one hand, Jessica\u0027s shoulder in the other, hurling them down off the ledge into the basin. They sprawled together in the sand as the roar of an explosion thundered over them. Its shock wave tumbled chips off the rock ledge they had vacated.\n Idaho sat up, brushed sand from himself.\n \"Not the family atomics!\" Jessica said. \"I thought - \"\n \"You planted a shield back there,\" Paul said.\n \"A big one turned to full force,\" Idaho said. \"A lasgun beam touched it and . . .\" He shrugged.\n \"Subatomic fusion,\" Jessica said. \"That\u0027s a dangerous weapon.\"\n \"Not weapon, m\u0027Lady, defense. That scum will think twice before using lasguns another time.\"\n The Fremen from the ornithopters stopped above them. One called in a low voice: \"We should get under cover, friends.\"\n Paul got to his feet as Idaho helped Jessica up.\n \"That blast will attract considerable attention, Sire,\" Idaho said.\n Sire , Paul thought.\n The word had such a strange sound when directed at him. Sire had always been his father.\n He felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience, seeing himself infected by the wild race consciousness that was moving the human universe toward chaos. The vision left him shaken, and he allowed Idaho to guide him along the edge of the basin to a rock projection. Fremen there were opening a way down into the sand with their compaction tools.\n \"May I take your pack, Sire?\" Idaho asked.\n \"It\u0027s not heavy, Duncan ,\" Paul said.\n \"You have no body shield,\" Idaho said. \"Do you wish mine?\" He glanced at the distant cliff. \"Not likely there\u0027ll be any more lasgun activity about.\"\n \"Keep your shield, Duncan . Your right arm is shield enough for me.\"\n Jessica saw the way the praise took effect, how Idaho moved closer to Paul, and she thought: Such a sure hand my son has with his people .\n The Fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the native basement complex of the desert. A camouflage cover was rigged for the opening.\n \"This way,\" one of the Fremen said, and he led them down rock steps into darkness.\n Behind them, the cover blotted out the moonlight. A dim green glow came alive ahead, revealing the steps and rock walls, a turn to the left. Robed Fremen were all around them now, pressing downward. They rounded the corner, found another down-slanting passage. It opened into a rough cave chamber.\n Kynes stood before them, jubba hood thrown back. The neck of his stillsuit glistening in the green light. His long hair and beard were mussed. The blue eyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows.\n In the moment of encounter, Kynes wondered at himself: Why am I helping these people? It\u0027s the most dangerous thing I\u0027ve ever done. It could doom me with them .\n Then he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle of manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except the position that now must be assumed - the dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment the dukedom still existed and solely because of this youth - and this was not a thing to be taken lightly.\n Jessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in the Bene Gesserit way - a laboratory, a civil place full of angles and squares in the ancient manner.\n \"This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father wanted as advance bases,\" Paul said.\n His father wanted! Kynes thought.\n And again Kynes wondered at himself. Am I foolish to aid these fugitives? Why am I doing it? It\u0027d be so easy to take them now, to buy the Harkonnen trust with them.\n Paul followed his mother\u0027s example, gestalting the room, seeing the workbench down one side, the walls of featureless rock. Instruments lined the bench - dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them. An ozone smell permeated the place.\n Some of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and new sounds started there - machine coughs, the whinnies of spinning belts and multidrives.\n Paul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with small animals in them stacked against the wall.\n \"You\u0027ve recognized this place correctly,\" Kynes said. \"For what would you use such a place, Paul Atreides?\"\n \"To make this planet a fit place for humans,\" Paul said.\n Perhaps that\u0027s why I help them , Kynes thought.\n The machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence. Into this void there came a thin animal squeak from the cages. It was cut off abruptly as though in embarrassment.\n Paul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were brown-winged bats. An automatic feeder extended from the side wall across the cages.\n A Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes: \"Liet, the field-generator equipment is not working. I am unable to mask us from proximity detectors.\"\n \"Can you repair it?\" Kynes asked.\n \"Not quickly. The parts . . . \" The man shrugged.\n \"Yes,\" Kynes said. \"Then we\u0027ll do without machinery. Get a hand pump for air out to the surface.\"\n \"Immediately.\" The man hurried away.\n Kynes turned back to Paul. \"You gave a good answer.\"\n Jessica marked the easy rumble of the man\u0027s voice. It was a royal voice, accustomed to command. And she had not missed the reference to him as Liet. Liet was the Fremen alter ego, the other face of the tame planetologist.\n \"We\u0027re most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes,\" she said.\n \"Mm-m-m, we\u0027ll see,\" Kynes said. He nodded to one of his men. \"Spice coffee in my quarters, Shamir.\"\n \"At once, Liet,\" the man said.\n Kynes indicated an arched opening in the side wall of the chamber. \"If you please?\"\n Jessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting. She saw Paul give a hand signal to Idaho , telling him to mount guard here.\n The passage, two paces deep, opened through a heavy door into a square office lighted by golden glowglobes. Jessica passed her hand across the door as she entered, was startled to identify plasteel.\n Paul stepped three paces into the room, dropped his pack to the floor. He heard the door close behind him, studied the place - about eight meters to a side, walls of natural rock, curry-colored, broken by metal filing cabinets on their right. A low desk with milk glass top shot full of yellow bubbles occupied the room\u0027s center. Four suspensor chairs ringed the desk.\n Kynes moved around Paul, held a chair for Jessica. She sat down, noting the way her son examined the room.\n Paul remained standing for another eyeblink. A faint anomaly in the room\u0027s air currents told him there was a secret exit to their right behind the filing cabinets.\n \"Will you sit down, Paul Atreides?\" Kynes asked.\n How carefully he avoids my title , Paul thought. But he accepted the chair, remained silent while Kynes sat down.\n \"You sense that Arrakis could be a paradise,\" Kynes said. \"Yet, as you see, the Imperium sends here only its trained hatchetmen, its seekers after the spice!\"\n Paul held up his thumb with its ducal signet. \"Do you see this ring?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Do you know its significance?\"\n Jessica turned sharply to stare at her son.\n \"Your father lies dead in the ruins of Arrakeen,\" Kynes said. \"You are technically the Duke.\"\n \"I\u0027m a soldier of the Imperium,\" Paul said, \"technically a hatchetman.\"\n Kynes face darkened. \"Even with the Emperor\u0027s Sardaukar standing over your father\u0027s body?\"\n \"The Sardaukar are one thing, the legal source of my authority is another,\" Paul said.\n \"Arrakis has its own way of determining who wears the mantle of authority,\" Kynes said.\n And Jessica, turning back to look at him, thought: There\u0027s steel in this man that no one has taken the temper out of . . . and we\u0027ve need of steel. Paul\u0027s doing a dangerous thing .\n Paul said: \"The Sardaukar on Arrakis are a measure of how much our beloved Emperor feared my father. Now, I will give the Padishah Emperor reasons to fear the - \"\n \"Lad,\" Kynes said, \"there are things you don\u0027t - \"\n \"You will address me as Sire or my Lord,\" Paul said.\n Gently , Jessica thought.\n Kynes stared at Paul, and Jessica noted the glint of admiration in the planetologist\u0027s face, the touch of humor there.\n \"Sire,\" Kynes said.\n \"I am an embarrassment to the Emperor,\" Paul said. \"I am an embarrassment to all who would divide Arrakis as their spoil. As I live, I shall continue to be such an embarrassment that I stick in their throats and choke them to death!\"\n \"Words,\" Kynes said.\n Paul stared at him. Presently, Paul said: \"You have a legend of the Lisan al-Gaib here, the Voice from the Outer World, the one who will lead the Fremen to paradise. Your men have - \"\n \"Superstition!\" Kynes said.\n \"Perhaps, \"Paul agreed. \"Yet perhaps not. Superstitions sometimes have strange roots and stranger branchings.\"\n \"You have a plan,\" Kynes said. \"This much is obvious . . . Sire .\"\n \"Could your Fremen provide me with proof positive that the Sardaukar are here in Harkonnen uniform?\"\n \"Quite likely.\"\n \"The Emperor will put a Harkonnen back in power here,\" Paul said. \"Perhaps even Beast Rabban. Let him. Once he has involved himself beyond escaping his guilt, let the Emperor face the possibility of a Bill of Particulars laid before the Landsraad. Let him answer there where - \"\n \"Paul!\" Jessica said.\n \"Granted that the Landsraad High Council accepts your case,\" Kynes said, \"there could be only one outcome: general warfare between the Imperium and the Great Houses.\"\n \"Chaos,\" Jessica said.\n \"But I\u0027d present my case to the Emperor,\" Paul said, \"and give him an alternative to chaos.\"\n Jessica spoke in a dry tone: \"Blackmail?\"\n \"One of the tools of statecraft, as you\u0027ve said yourself,\" Paul said, and Jessica heard the bitterness in his voice. \"The Emperor has no sons, only daughters.\"\n \"You\u0027d aim for the throne?\" Jessica asked.\n \"The Emperor will not risk having the Imperium shattered by total war,\" Paul said. \"Planets blasted, disorder everywhere - he\u0027ll not risk that.\"\n \"This is a desperate gamble you propose,\" Kynes said.\n \"What do the Great Houses of the Landsraad fear most?\" Paul asked. \"They fear most what is happening here right now on Arrakis - the Sardaukar picking them off one by one. That\u0027s why there is a Landsraad. This is the glue of the Great Convention. Only in union do they match the Imperial forces.\"\n \"But they\u0027re - \"\n \"This is what they fear,\" Paul said. \"Arrakis would become a rallying cry. Each of them would see himself in my father - cut out of the herd and killed.\"\n Kynes spoke to Jessica: \"Would his plan work?\"\n \"I\u0027m no Mentat,\" Jessica said.\n \"But you are Bene Gesserit.\"\n She shot a probing stare at him, said: \"His plan has good points and bad points . . . as any plan would at this stage. A plan depends as much upon execution as it does upon concept.\"\n \" \u0027Law is the ultimate science,\u0027 \" Paul quoted. \"Thus it reads above the Emperor\u0027s door. I propose to show him law.\"\n \"And I\u0027m not sure I could trust the person who conceived this plan,\" Kynes said. \"Arrakis has its own plan that we - \"\n \"From the throne,\" Paul said, \"I could make a paradise of Arrakis with the wave of a hand. This is the coin I offer for your support.\"\n Kynes stiffened. \"My loyalty\u0027s not for sale, Sire .\"\n Paul stared across the desk at him, meeting the cold glare of those blue-within-blue eyes, studying the bearded face, the commanding appearance. A harsh smile touched Paul\u0027s lips and he said: \"Well spoken. I apologize.\"\n Kynes met Paul\u0027s stare and, presently, said: \"No Harkonnen ever admitted error. Perhaps you\u0027re not like them, Atreides.\"\n \"It could be a fault in their education,\" Paul said. \"You say you\u0027re not for sale, but I believe I\u0027ve the coin you\u0027ll accept. For your loyalty I offer my loyalty to you . . . totally.\"\n My son has the Atreides sincerity , Jessica thought. He has that tremendous, almost na��ve honor - and what a powerful force that truly is.\n She saw that Paul\u0027s words had shaken Kynes.\n \"This is nonsense,\" Kynes said. \"You\u0027re just a boy and - \"\n \"I\u0027m the Duke,\" Paul said. \"I\u0027m an Atreides. No Atreides has ever broken such a bond.\"\n Kynes swallowed.\n \"When I say totally,\" Paul said, \"I mean without reservation. I would give my life for you.\"\n \"Sire!\" Kynes said, and the word was torn from him, but Jessica saw that he was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen, but to a man, to a superior. Now Kynes meant the word.\n In this moment he\u0027d give his life for Paul , she thought. How do the Atreides accomplish this thing so quickly, so easily?\n \"I know you mean this,\" Kynes said. \"Yet the Harkon - \"\n The door behind Paul slammed open. He whirled to see reeling violence - shouting, the clash of steel, wax-image faces grimacing in the passage.\n With his mother beside him, Paul leaped for the door, seeing Idaho blocking the passage, his blood-pitted eyes there visible through a shield blur, claw hands beyond him, arcs of steel chopping futilely at the shield. There was the orange fire-mouth of a stunner repelled by the shield. Idaho \u0027s blades were through it all, flick-flicking, red dripping from them.\n Then Kynes was beside Paul and they threw their weight against the door.\n Paul had one last glimpse of Idaho standing against a swarm of Harkonnen uniforms - his jerking, controlled staggers, the black goat hair with a red blossom of death in it. Then the door was closed and there came a snick as Kynes threw the bolts.\n \"I appear to\u0027ve decided,\" Kynes said.\n \"Someone detected your machinery before it was shut down,\" Paul said. He pulled his mother away from the door, met the despair in her eyes.\n \"I should\u0027ve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive,\" Kynes said.\n \"You\u0027ve a bolt hole out of here,\" Paul said. \"Shall we use it?\"\n Kynes took a deep breath, said: \"This door should hold for at least twenty minutes against all but a lasgun.\"\n \"They\u0027ll not use a lasgun for fear we\u0027ve shields on this side,\" Paul said.\n \"Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniform,\" Jessica whispered.\n They could hear pounding on the door now, rhythmic blows.\n Kynes indicated the cabinets against the right-hand wall, said: \"This way.\" He crossed to the first cabinet, opened a drawer, manipulated a handle within it. The entire wall of cabinets swung open to expose the black mouth of a tunnel. \"This door also is plasteel,\" Kynes said.\n \"You were well prepared,\" Jessica said.\n \"We lived under the Harkonnens for eighty years,\" Kynes said. He herded them into the darkness, closed the door.\n In the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead of her.\n Kynes\u0027 voice came from behind them: \"We\u0027ll separate here. This wall is tougher. It\u0027ll stand for at least an hour. Follow the arrows like that one on the floor. They\u0027ll be extinguished by your passage. They lead through a maze to another exit where I\u0027ve secreted a \u0027thopter. There\u0027s a storm across the desert tonight. Your only hope is to run for that storm, dive into the top of it, ride with it. My people have done this in stealing \u0027thopters. If you stay high in the storm you\u0027ll survive.\"\n \"What of you?\" Paul asked.\n \"I\u0027ll try to escape another way. If I\u0027m captured . . . well, I\u0027m still Imperial Planetologist. I can say I was your captive.\"\n Running like cowards , Paul thought. But how else can I live to avenge my father? He turned to face the door.\n Jessica heard him move, said \" Duncan \u0027s dead, Paul. You saw the wound. You can do nothing for him.\"\n \"I\u0027ll take full payment for them all one day,\" Paul said.\n \"Not unless you hurry now,\" Kynes said.\n Paul felt the man\u0027s hand on his shoulder.\n \"Where will we meet, Kynes?\" Paul asked.\n \"I\u0027ll send Fremen searching for you. The storm\u0027s path is known. Hurry now, and the Great Mother give you speed and luck.\"\n They heard him go, a scrambling in the blackness.\n Jessica found Paul\u0027s hand, pulled him gently. \"We must not get separated,\" she said.\n \"Yes.\"\n He followed her across the first arrow, seeing it go black as they touched it. Another arrow beckoned ahead.\n They crossed it, saw it extinguish itself, saw another arrow ahead.\n They were running now.\n Plans within plans within plans within plans , Jessica thought. Have we become part of someone else\u0027s plan now?\n The arrows led them around turnings, past side openings only dimly sensed in the faint luminescence. Their way slanted downward for a time, then up, ever up. They came finally to steps, rounded a corner and were brought short by a glowing wall with a dark handle visible in its center.\n Paul pressed the handle.\n The wall swung away from them. Light flared to reveal a rock-hewn cavern with an ornithopter squatting in its center. A flat gray wall with a doorsign on it loomed beyond the aircraft.\n \"Where did Kynes go?\" Jessica asked.\n \"He did what any good guerrilla leader would,\" Paul said. \"He separated us into two parties and arranged that he couldn\u0027t reveal where we are if he\u0027s captured. He won\u0027t really know.\"\n Paul drew her into the room, noting how their feet kicked up dust on the floor.\n \"No one\u0027s been here for a long time,\" he said.\n \"He seemed confident the Fremen could find us,\" she said.\n \"I share that confidence.\"\n Paul released her hand, crossed to the ornithopter\u0027s left door, opened it, and secured his pack in the rear. \"This ship\u0027s proximity masked,\" he said. \"Instrument panel has remote door control, light control. Eighty years under the Harkonnens taught them to be thorough.\"\n Jessica leaned against the craft\u0027s other side, catching her breath.\n \"The Harkonnens will have a covering force over this area,\" she said. \"They\u0027re not stupid.\" She considered her direction sense, pointed right. \"The storm we saw is that way.\"\n Paul nodded, fighting an abrupt reluctance to move. He knew its cause, but found no help in the knowledge. Somewhere this night he had passed a decision-nexus into the deep unknown. He knew the time-area surrounding them, but the here-and-now existed as a place of mystery. It was as though he had seen himself from a distance go out of sight down into a valley. Of the countless paths up out of that valley, some might carry a Paul Atreides back into sight, but many would not.\n \"The longer we wait the better prepared they\u0027ll be,\" Jessica said.\n \"Get in and strap yourself down,\" he said.\n He joined her in the ornithopter, still wrestling with the thought that this was blind ground, unseen in any prescient vision. And he realized with an abrupt sense of shock that he had been giving more and more reliance to prescient memory and it had weakened him for this particular emergency.\n \"If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.\" It was a Bene Gesserit axiom. He took it to himself now, promising never again to fall into that trap . . . if he lived through this.\n Paul fastened his safety harness, saw that his mother was secure, checked the aircraft. The wings were at full spread-rest, their delicate metal interleavings extended. He touched the retractor bar, watched the wings shorten for jet-boost take-off the way Gurney Halleck had taught him. The starter switch moved easily. Dials on the instrument panel came alive as the jetpods were armed. Turbines began their low hissing.\n \"Ready?\" he asked.\n \"Yes.\"\n He touched the remote control for lights.\n Darkness blanketed them.\n His hand was a shadow against the luminous dials as he tripped the remote door control. Grating sounded ahead of them. A cascade of sand swished away to silence. A dusty breeze touched Paul\u0027s cheeks. He closed his door, feeling the sudden pressure.\n A wide patch of dust-blurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared where the door-wall had been. Starlight defined a shelf beyond, a suggestion of sand ripples.\n Paul depressed the glowing action-sequence switch on his panel. The wings snapped back and down, hurling the \u0027thopter out of its nest. Power surged from the jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude.\n Jessica let her hands ride lightly on the dual controls, feeling the sureness of her son\u0027s movements. She was frightened, yet exhilarated. Now, Paul\u0027s training is our only hope , she thought. His youth and swiftness .\n Paul fed more power to the jetpods. The \u0027thopter banked, sinking them into their seats as a dark wall lifted against the stars ahead. He gave the craft more wing, more power. Another burst of lifting wingbeats and they came out over rocks, silver-frosted angles and outcroppings in the starlight. The dust-reddened second moon showed itself above the horizon to their right, defining the ribbon trail of the storm.\n Paul\u0027s hands danced over the controls. Wings snicked in to beetle stubs. G-force pulled at their flesh as the craft came around in a tight bank.\n \"Jetflares behind us!\" Jessica said.\n \"I saw them.\"\n He slammed the power arm forward.\n Their \u0027thopter leaped like a frightened animal, surged southwest toward the storm and the great curve of desert. In the near distance, Paul saw scattered shadows telling where the line of rocks ended, the basement complex sinking beneath the dunes. Beyond stretched moonlit fingernail shadows - dunes diminishing one into another.\n And above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a wall against the stars.\n Something jarred the \u0027thopter.\n \"Shellburst!\" Jessica gasped. \"They\u0027re using some kind of projectile weapon.\"\n She saw a sudden animal grin on Paul\u0027s face. \"They seem to be avoiding their lasguns,\" he said.\n \"But we\u0027ve no shields!\"\n \"Do they know that?\"\n Again the \u0027thopter shuddered.\n Paul twisted to peer back. \"Only one of them appears to be fast enough to keep up with us.\"\n He returned his attention to their course, watching the storm wall grow high in front of them. It loomed like a tangible solid.\n \"Projectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaponry - that\u0027s one thing we\u0027ll give the Fremen,\" Paul whispered.\n \"The storm,\" Jessica said. \"Hadn\u0027t you better turn?\"\n \"What about the ship behind us?\"\n \"He\u0027s pulling up.\"\n \"Now!\"\n Paul stubbed the wings, banked hard left into the deceptively slow boiling of the storm wall, felt his cheeks pull in the G-force.\n They appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier and heavier until it blotted out the desert and the moon. The aircraft became a long, horizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green luminosity of the instrument panel.\n Through Jessica\u0027s mind flashed all the warnings about such storms - that they cut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone and ate away the bones. She felt the buffeting of dust-blanketed wind. It twisted them as Paul fought the controls. She saw him chop the power, felt the ship buck. The metal around them hissed and trembled.\n \"Sand!\" Jessica shouted.\n She saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel. \"Not much sand this high.\"\n But she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.\n Paul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with the strain. He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments, gliding by instinct, fighting for altitude.\n The sound of their passage diminished.\n The \u0027thopter began rolling off to the left. Paul focused on the glowing globe within the attitude curve, fought his craft back to level flight.\n Jessica had the eerie feeling that they were standing still, that all motion was external. A vague tan flowing against the windows, a rumbling hiss reminded her of the powers around them.\n Winds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour , she thought. Adrenaline edginess gnawed at her. I must not fear , she told herself, mouthing the words of the Bene Gesserit litany. Fear is the mind-killer .\n Slowly her long years of training prevailed.\n Calmness returned.\n \"We have the tiger by the tail,\" Paul whispered. \"We can\u0027t go down, can\u0027t land . . . and I don\u0027t think I can lift us out of this. We\u0027ll have to ride it out.\"\n Calmness drained out of her. Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped them together. Then she heard Paul\u0027s voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany:\n \"Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear\u0027s path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\"\n What do you despise? By this are you truly known.\n - from \"Manual of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\n \"They are dead, Baron,\" said Iakin Nefud, the guard captain. \"Both the woman and the boy are certainly dead.\"\n The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sat up in the sleep suspensors of his private quarters. Beyond these quarters and enclosing him like a multishelled egg stretched the space frigate he had grounded on Arrakis. Here in his quarters, though, the ship\u0027s harsh metal was disguised with draperies, with fabric paddings and rare art objects.\n \"It is a certainty,\" the guard captain said. \"They are dead.\"\n The Baron shifted his gross body in the suspensors, focused his attention on an ebaline statue of a leaping boy in a niche across the room. Sleep faded from him. He straightened the padded suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck, stared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where Captain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.\n \"They\u0027re certainly dead, Baron,\" the man repeated.\n The Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud \u0027s eyes. It was obvious the man had been deep within the drug\u0027s rapture when he received this report, and had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here.\n \"I have a full report,\" Nefud said.\n Let him sweat a little , the Baron thought. One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear - sharp and ready . \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dune-dune-chronicles-1/page-14.html","bookId":2153,"book":{"id":2153,"title":"Dune (Dune Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Dune (Dune Chronicles #1) \n Set in the far future amidst a sprawling feudal interstellar empire where planetary dynasties are controlled by noble houses that owe an allegiance to the imperial House Corrino, Dune tells the story of young Paul Atreides (the heir apparent to Duke Leto Atreides and heir of House Atreides) as he and his family accept control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the \"spice\" melange, the most important and valuable substance in the universe.
