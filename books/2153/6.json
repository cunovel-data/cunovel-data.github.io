{"id":96859,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Paul leaned forward, staring at the machine.\\n\\n Scaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was about one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide. It was basically a long, bug-like body moving on independent sets of wide tracks.\\n\\n \"This is a harvester factory,\" Hawat said. \"We chose one in good repair for this projection. There\u0027s one dragline outfit that came in with the first team of Imperial ecologists, though, and it\u0027s still running . . . although I don\u0027t know how . . . or why.\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s the one they call \u0027Old Maria,\u0027 it belongs in a museum,\" an aide said. \"I think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment job, a threat hanging over their workers\u0027 heads. Be good or you\u0027ll be assigned to \u0027Old Maria.\u0027 \"\\n\\n Chuckles sounded around the table.\\n\\n Paul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the projection and the question that filled his mind. He pointed to the image on the table, said: \"Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?\"\\n\\n Quick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then thought: No - they have to face the realities here .\\n\\n \"There\u0027re worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one gulp,\" Hawat said. \"Up here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the spicing\u0027s done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and devour it at their leisure.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t we shield them?\" Paul asked.\\n\\n \"According to Idaho \u0027s report,\" Hawat said, \"shields are dangerous in the desert. A body-size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters around. It appears to drive them into a killing frenzy. We\u0027ve the Fremen word on this and no reason to doubt it. Idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment at the sietch.\"\\n\\n \"None at all?\" Paul asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027d be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand people,\" Hawat said. \" Idaho had free access to every part of the sietch. He saw no shields or any indication of their use.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a puzzle,\" the Duke said.\\n\\n \"The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here,\" Hawat said. \"They had repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts.\"\\n\\n \"Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?\" Paul asked.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t seem likely,\" Hawat said. \"It\u0027s theoretically possible, of course - a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick, but no one\u0027s ever been able to put it to the test.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027d have heard about it before now,\" Halleck said. \"The smugglers have close contact with the Fremen and would\u0027ve acquired such a device if it were available. And they\u0027d have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like an unanswered question of this importance,\" Leto said. \"Thufir, I want you to give top priority to solution of this problem.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re already working on it, my Lord.\" He cleared his throat. \" Ah-h , Idaho did say one thing: he said you couldn\u0027t mistake the Fremen attitude toward shields. He said they were mostly amused by them.\"\\n\\n The Duke frowned, then: \"The subject under discussion is spicing equipment.\"\\n\\n Hawat gestured to his aide at the projector.\\n\\n The solido-image of the harvester-factory was replaced by a projection of a winged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it. \"This is a carryall,\" Hawat said. \"It\u0027s essentially a large \u0027thopter, whose sole function is to deliver a factory to spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a sandworm appears. They always appear. Harvesting the spice is a process of getting in and getting out with as much as possible.\"\\n\\n \"Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality,\" the Duke said.\\n\\n Laughter was abrupt and too loud.\\n\\n An ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.\\n\\n \"These \u0027thopters are fairly conventional,\" Hawat said. \"Major modifications give them extended range. Extra care has been used in sealing essential areas against sand and dust. Only about one in thirty is shielded - possibly discarding the shield generator\u0027s weight for greater range.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like this de-emphasis on shields,\" the Duke muttered. And he thought: Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won\u0027t even be able to escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us? He shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts, said: \"Let\u0027s get to the working estimate. What\u0027ll our profit figure be?\"\\n\\n Hawat turned two pages in his notebook. \"After assessing the repairs and operable equipment, we\u0027ve worked out a first estimate on operating costs. It\u0027s based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety margin.\" He closed his eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: \"Under the Harkonnens, maintenance and salaries were held to fourteen per cent. We\u0027ll be lucky to make it at thirty per cent at first. With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for, including the CHOAM percentage and military costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very narrow six or seven per cent until we can replace worn-out equipment. We then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs.\" He opened his eyes. \"Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re working for a solid and permanent planetary base,\" the Duke said. \"We have to keep a large percentage of the people happy - especially the Fremen.\"\\n\\n \"Most especially the Fremen,\" Hawat agreed.\\n\\n \"Our supremacy on Caladan,\" the Duke said, \"depended on sea and air power. Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This may include air power, but it\u0027s possible it may not. I call your attention to the lack of \u0027thopter shields.\" He shook his head. \"The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel. We don\u0027t dare. Each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs.\"\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027ll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest,\" Hawat said. \"Our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the Harkonnen average.\"\\n\\n \"There it is,\" the Duke said, \"exactly as we expected. We\u0027ll have to move fast with the Fremen. I\u0027d like five full battalions of Fremen troops before the first CHOAM audit.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not much time, Sire,\" Hawat said.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have much time, as you well know. They\u0027ll be here with Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity. How many do you think they\u0027ll ship in, Thufir?\"\\n\\n \"Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more. Guild troop-transport costs being what they are.\"\\n\\n \"Then five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it. Let us have a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council and matters will be much different - profits or no profits.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll do our best, Sire.\"\\n\\n Paul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the Mentat\u0027s great age, aware that the old man had served three generations of Atreides. Aged . It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the cheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve of the shoulders and the thin set of his lips with the cranberry-colored stain of sapho juice.\\n\\n So much depends on one aged man , Paul thought.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re presently in a war of assassins,\" the Duke said, \"but it has not achieved full scale. Thufir, what\u0027s the condition of the Harkonnen machine here?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve eliminated two hundred and fifty-nine of their key people, my Lord. No more than three Harkonnen cells remain - perhaps a hundred people in all.\"\\n\\n \"These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated,\" the Duke said, \"were they propertied?\"\\n\\n \"Most were well situated, my Lord - in the entrepreneur class.\"\\n\\n \"I want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each of them,\" the Duke said. \"File copies with the Judge of the Change. We\u0027ll take the legal position that they stayed under false allegiance. Confiscate their property, take everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure the Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal.\"\\n\\n Thufir smiled, revealing red-stained teeth beneath the carmine lips. \"A move worthy of your grandsire, my Lord. It shames me I didn\u0027t think of it first.\"\\n\\n Halleck frowned across the table, surprised a deep scowl on Paul\u0027s face. The others were smiling and nodding.\\n\\n It\u0027s wrong , Paul thought. This\u0027ll only make the others fight all the harder. They\u0027ve nothing to gain by surrendering .\\n\\n He knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this was the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory.\\n\\n \" \u0027I have been a stranger in a strange land,\u0027 \" Halleck quoted.\\n\\n Paul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible, wondering: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?\\n\\n The Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at Halleck. \"Gurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay with us?\"\\n\\n \"Two hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. I think we should take them and consider ourselves lucky. They\u0027re all in useful categories.\"\\n\\n \"No more?\" The Duke pursed his lips, then: \"Well, pass the word along to - \"\\n\\n A disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke\u0027s ear.\\n\\n Leto waved him back, said: \"Speak out, Duncan . You can see this is strategy staff.\"\\n\\n Paul studied Idaho , marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho \u0027s dark round face turned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.\\n\\n Idaho looked down the length of the table, said: \"We\u0027ve taken a force of Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however, we found the Harkonnens had waylaid the Fremen courier - badly wounded him. We were bringing him here for treatment by our medics when he died. I\u0027d seen how badly off the man was and stopped to do what I could. I surprised him in the attempt to throw something away.\" Idaho glanced down at Leto. \"A knife, m\u0027Lord, a knife the like of which you\u0027ve never seen.\"\\n\\n \"Crysknife?\" someone asked.\\n\\n \"No doubt of it,\" Idaho said. \"Milky white and glowing with a light of its own like.\" He reached into his tunic, brought out a sheath with a black-ridged handle protruding from it.\\n\\n \"Keep that blade in its sheath!\"\\n\\n The voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and penetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.\\n\\n A tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the guard. A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue - no white in them at all.\\n\\n \"Let him enter,\" Idaho whispered.\\n\\n \"Pass that man,\" the Duke said.\\n\\n The guards hesitated, then lowered their swords.\\n\\n The man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.\\n\\n \"This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch I visited, leader of those who warned us of the false band,\" Idaho said.\\n\\n \"Welcome, sir,\" Leto said. \"And why shouldn\u0027t we unsheath this blade?\"\\n\\n Stilgar glanced at Idaho , said: \"You observed the customs of cleanliness and honor among us. I would permit you to see the blade of the man you befriended.\" His gaze swept the others in the room. \"But I do not know these others. Would you have them defile an honorable weapon?\"\\n\\n \"I am the Duke Leto,\" the Duke said. \"Would you permit me to see this blade?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll permit you to earn the right to unsheath it,\" Stilgar said, and, as a mutter of protest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined hand. \"I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you.\"\\n\\n In the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that radiated from him. He was a leader - a Fremen leader.\\n\\n A man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: \"Who\u0027s he to tell us what rights we have on Arrakis?\"\\n\\n \"It is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the governed,\" the Fremen said. \"Thus I must tell you the way it is with us: a certain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife.\" He passed a dark glance across Idaho . \"They are ours. They may never leave Arrakis without our consent.\"\\n\\n Halleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on their faces. Halleck said: \"The Duke Leto determines whether - \"\\n\\n \"One moment, please,\" Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held them. This must not get out of hand , he thought. He addressed himself to the Fremen: \"Sir, I honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects my dignity. I am indeed indebted to you. And I always pay my debts. If it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered - by me . And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you have but to name it.\"\\n\\n The Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing a thin nose and full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard. Deliberately he bent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.\\n\\n As the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho \u0027s voice boomed across the room: \"Hold!\"\\n\\n Into the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: \"We thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body\u0027s moisture. We accept it in the spirit with which it is given.\" And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.\\n\\n Aside to the Duke, he said; \"Remember how precious water is here, Sire. That was a token of respect.\"\\n\\n Leto sank back into his own chair, caught Paul\u0027s eye, a rueful grin on his son\u0027s face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as understanding came to his men.\\n\\n The Fremen looked at Idaho , said: \"You measured well in my sietch, Duncan Idaho. Is there a bond on your allegiance to your Duke?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s asking me to enlist with him. Sire,\" Idaho said.\\n\\n \"Would he accept a dual allegiance?\" Leto asked.\\n\\n \"You wish me to go with him, Sire?\"\\n\\n \"I wish you to make your own decision in the matter,\" Leto said, and he could not keep the urgency out of his voice.\\n\\n Idaho studied the Fremen. \"Would you have me under these conditions, Stilgar? There\u0027d be times when I\u0027d have to return to serve my Duke.\"\\n\\n \"You fight well and you did your best for our friend,\" Stilgar said. He looked at Leto. \"Let it be thus: the man Idaho keeps the crysknife he holds as a mark of his allegiance to us. He must be cleansed, of course, and the rites observed, but this can be done. He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides. There is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters.\"\\n\\n \" Duncan ?\" Leto asked.\\n\\n \"I understand, Sire,\" Idaho said.\\n\\n \"It is agreed, then,\" Leto said.\\n\\n \"Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho.\" Stilgar said. \"The body of our friend remains with your Duke. His water is Atreides water. It is a bond between us.\"\\n\\n Leto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentat\u0027s eye. Hawat nodded, his expression pleased.\\n\\n \"I will await below,\" Stilgar said, \"while Idaho makes farewell with his friends. Turok was the name of our dead friend. Remember that when it comes time to release his spirit. You are friends of Turok.\"\\n\\n Stilgar started to turn away.\\n\\n \"Will you not stay a while?\" Leto asked.\\n\\n The Fremen turned back, whipping his veil into place with a casual gesture, adjusting something beneath it. Paul glimpsed what looked like a thin tube before the veil settled into place.\\n\\n \"Is there reason to stay?\" the Fremen asked.\\n\\n \"We would honor you,\" the Duke said.\\n\\n \"Honor requires that I be elsewhere soon,\" the Fremen said. He shot another glance at Idaho , whirled, and strode out past the door guards.\\n\\n \"If the other Fremen match him, we\u0027ll serve each other well,\" Leto said.\\n\\n Idaho spoke in a dry voice: \"He\u0027s a fair sample, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"You understand what you\u0027re to do, Duncan ?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"Much depends on you, Duncan. We\u0027re going to need at least five battalions of those people before the Sardaukar descend on us.\"\\n\\n \"This is going to take some doing, Sire. The Fremen are a pretty independent bunch.\" Idaho hesitated, then: \"And, Sire, there\u0027s one other thing. One of the mercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade from our dead Fremen friend. The mercenary says there\u0027s a Harkonnen reward of a million Solaris for anyone who\u0027ll bring in a single crysknife.\"\\n\\n Leto\u0027s chin came up in a movement of obvious surprise. \"Why do they want one of those blades so badly?\"\\n\\n \"The knife is ground from a sandworm\u0027s tooth; it\u0027s the mark of the Fremen, Sire. With it, a blue-eyed man could penetrate any sietch in the land. They\u0027d question me unless I were known. I don\u0027t look Fremen. But . . . \"\\n\\n \"Piter de Vries,\" the Duke said.\\n\\n \"A man of devilish cunning, my Lord,\" Hawat said.\\n\\n Idaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic.\\n\\n \"Guard that knife,\" the Duke said.\\n\\n \"I understand, m\u0027Lord.\" He patted the transceiver on his belt kit. \"I\u0027ll report soon as possible. Thufir has my call code. Use battle language.\" He saluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen.\\n\\n They heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor.\\n\\n A look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat. They smiled.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve much to do, Sire,\" Halleck said.\\n\\n \"And I keep you from your work,\" Leto said.\\n\\n \"I have the report on the advance bases,\" Hawat said. \"Shall I give it another time, Sire?\"\\n\\n \"Will it take long?\"\\n\\n \"Not for a briefing. It\u0027s said among the Fremen that there were more than two hundred of these advance bases built here on Arrakis during the Desert Botanical Testing Station period. All supposedly have been abandoned, but there are reports they were sealed off before being abandoned.\"\\n\\n \"Equipment in them?\" the Duke asked.\\n\\n \"According to the reports I have from Duncan .\"\\n\\n \"Where are they located?\" Halleck asked.\\n\\n \"The answer to that question,\" Hawat said, \"is invariably: \u0027Liet knows.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"God knows,\" Leto muttered.\\n\\n \"Perhaps not. Sire,\" Hawat said. \"You heard this Stilgar use the name. Could he have been referring to a real person?\"\\n\\n \"Serving two masters,\" Halleck said. \"It sounds like a religious quotation.\"\\n\\n \"And you should know,\" the Duke said.\\n\\n Halleck smiled.\\n\\n \"This Judge of the Change,\" Leto said, \"the Imperial ecologist - Kynes . . . Wouldn\u0027t he know where those bases are?\"\\n\\n \"Sire,\" Hawat cautioned, \"this Kynes is an Imperial servant.\"\\n\\n \"And he\u0027s a long way from the Emperor,\" Leto said. \"I want those bases. They\u0027d be loaded with materials we could salvage and use for repair of our working equipment.\"\\n\\n \"Sire!\" Hawat said. \"Those bases are still legally His Majesty\u0027s fief.\"\\n\\n \"The weather here\u0027s savage enough to destroy anything,\" the Duke said. \"We can always blame the weather. Get this Kynes and at least find out if the bases exist.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Twere dangerous to commandeer them,\" Hawat said. \" Duncan was clear on one thing: those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for the Fremen. We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases.\"\\n\\n Paul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the way they followed every word. They appeared deeply disturbed by his father\u0027s attitude.\\n\\n \"Listen to him, Father,\" Paul said in a low voice. \"He speaks truth.\"\\n\\n \"Sire,\" Hawat said, \"those bases could give us material to repair every piece of equipment left us, yet be beyond reach for strategic reasons. It\u0027d be rash to move without greater knowledge. This Kynes has arbiter authority from the Imperium. We mustn\u0027t forget that. And the Fremen defer to him.\"\\n\\n \"Do it gently, then,\" the Duke said. \"I wish to know only if those bases exist.\"\\n\\n \"As you will, Sire.\" Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.\\n\\n \"All right, then,\" the Duke said. \"We know what we have ahead of us - work. We\u0027ve been trained for it. We\u0027ve some experience in it. We know what the rewards are and the alternatives are clear enough. You all have your assignments.\" He looked at Halleck. \"Gurney, take care of that smuggler situation first.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027I shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land,\u0027 \" Halleck intoned.\\n\\n \"Someday I\u0027ll catch that man without a quotation and he\u0027ll look undressed,\" the Duke said.\\n\\n Chuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the effort in them.\\n\\n The Duke turned to Hawat. \"Set up another command post for intelligence and communications on this floor, Thufir. When you have them ready, I\u0027ll want to see you.\"\\n\\n Hawat arose, glanced around the room as though seeking support. He turned away, led the procession out of the room. The others moved hurriedly, scraping their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion.\\n\\n It ended up in confusion , Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men to leave. Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting had just seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an argument to top it off.\\n\\n For the first time, Paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility of defeat - not thinking about it out of fear or because of warnings such as that of the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own assessment of the situation.\\n\\n My father is desperate , he thought. Things aren\u0027t going well for us at all .\\n\\n And Hawat - Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the conference - subtle hesitations, signs of unrest.\\n\\n Hawat was deeply troubled by something.\\n\\n \"Best you remain here the rest of the night, Son,\" the Duke said. \"It\u0027ll be dawn soon, anyway. I\u0027ll inform your mother.\" He got to his feet, slowly, stiffly. \"Why don\u0027t you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on them for some rest.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not very tired, sir.\"\\n\\n \"As you will.\"\\n\\n The Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the length of the table.\\n\\n Like a caged animal , Paul thought.\\n\\n \"Are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?\" Paul asked.\\n\\n The Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows. \"We\u0027ve discussed the possibility many times.\"\\n\\n \"The old woman seemed so sure of herself,\" Paul said. \"And the message Mother - \"\\n\\n \"Precautions have been taken,\" the Duke said. He looked around the room, and Paul marked the hunted wildness in his father\u0027s eyes. \"Remain here. There are some things about the command posts I want to discuss with Thufir.\" He turned, strode out of the room, nodding shortly to the door guards.\\n\\n Paul stared at the place where his father had stood. The space had been empty even before the Duke left the room. And he recalled the old woman\u0027s warning: \" - for the father, nothing.\"\\n\\n On that first day when Muad\u0027Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: \"Mahdi!\" But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.\\n\\n - from \"Manual of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\\n The Duke found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard directed him. There was the sound of men setting up communications equipment in an adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet. The Duke glanced around as Hawat arose from a paper-cluttered table. It was a green-walled enclosure with, in addition to the table, three suspensor chairs from which the Harkonnen \"H \" had been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect color patch.\\n\\n \"The chairs are liberated but quite safe,\" Hawat said. \"Where is Paul, Sire?\"\\n\\n \"I left him in the conference room. I\u0027m hoping he\u0027ll get some rest without me there to distract him.\"\\n\\n Hawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it, shutting off the noise of static and electronic sparking.\\n\\n \"Thufir,\" Leto said, \"the Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract my attention.\"\\n\\n \"M\u0027Lord?\"\\n\\n The Duke pursed his lips. \"Storehouses are susceptible to destruction.\" He raised a hand as Hawat started to speak. \"Ignore the Emperor\u0027s hoard. He\u0027d secretly enjoy it if the Harkonnens were embarrassed. And can the Baron object if something is destroyed which he cannot openly admit that he has?\"\\n\\n Hawat shook his head. \"We\u0027ve few men to spare. Sire.\"\\n\\n \"Use some of Idaho \u0027s men. And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy a trip off planet. A raid on Giedi Prime - there are tactical advantages to such a diversion, Thufir.\"\\n\\n \"As you say, my Lord.\" Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of nervousness in the old man, thought: Perhaps he suspects I distrust him. He must know I\u0027ve private reports of traitors. Well - best quiet his fears immediately .\\n\\n \"Thufir,\" he said, \"since you\u0027re one of the few I can trust completely, there\u0027s another matter bears discussion. We both know how constant a watch we must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces . . . but I have two new reports.\"\\n\\n Hawat turned, stared at him.\\n\\n And Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought.\\n\\n Instead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only increased Hawat\u0027s agitation.\\n\\n Leto studied the old man and, presently, said: \"You\u0027ve been holding something back, old friend. I should\u0027ve suspected when you were so nervous during Staff. What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full conference?\"\\n\\n Hawat\u0027s sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny wrinkles radiating into them. They maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he said: \"My Lord, I don\u0027t quite know how to broach this.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir,\" the Duke said. \"You know you can broach any subject with me.\"\\n\\n Hawat continued to stare at him, thinking: This is how I like him best. This is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why must I hurt him?\\n\\n \"Well?\" Leto demanded.\\n\\n Hawat shrugged. \"It\u0027s a scrap of a note. We took it from a Harkonnen courier. The note was intended for an agent named Pardee. We\u0027ve good reason to believe Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here. The note - it\u0027s a thing that could have great consequence or no consequence. It\u0027s susceptible to various interpretations.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the delicate content of this note?\"\\n\\n \"Scrap of a note, my Lord. Incomplete. It was on minimic film with the usual destruction capsule attached. We stopped the acid action just short of full erasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely suggestive.\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n Hawat rubbed at his lips. \"It says: \u0027. . . eto will never suspect, and when the blow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source alone should be enough to destroy him.\u0027 The note was under the Baron\u0027s own seal and I\u0027ve authenticated the seal.\"\\n\\n \"Your suspicion is obvious,\" the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d sooner cut off my arms than hurt you,\" Hawat said. \"My Lord, what if . . .\"\\n\\n \"The Lady Jessica,\" Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. \"Couldn\u0027t you wring the facts out of this Pardee?\"\\n\\n \"Unfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we intercepted the courier. The courier, I\u0027m certain, did not know what he carried.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\"\\n\\n Leto shook his head, thinking: What a slimy piece of business. There can\u0027t be anything in it. I know my woman.\\n\\n \"My Lord, if - \"\\n\\n \"No!\" the Duke barked. \"There\u0027s a mistake here that - \"\\n\\n \"We cannot ignore it, my Lord.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s been with me for sixteen years! There\u0027ve been countless opportunities for - You yourself investigated the school and the woman!\"\\n\\n Hawat spoke bitterly: \"Things have been known to escape me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s impossible, I tell you! The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides line - meaning Paul, too. They\u0027ve already tried once. Could a woman conspire against her own son?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps she doesn\u0027t conspire against her son. And yesterday\u0027s attempt could\u0027ve been a clever sham.\"\\n\\n \"It couldn\u0027t have been a sham.\"\\n\\n \"Sire, she isn\u0027t supposed to know her parentage, but what if she does know? What if she were an orphan, say, orphaned by an Atreides?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027d have moved long before now. Poison in my drink . . . a stiletto at night. Who has had better opportunity?\"\\n\\n \"The Harkonnens mean to destroy you, my Lord. Their intent is not just to kill. There\u0027s a range of fine distinctions in kanly. This could be a work of art among vendettas.\"\\n\\n The Duke\u0027s shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired. It cannot be , he thought. The woman has opened her heart to me .\\n\\n \"What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman I love?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"An interpretation I\u0027ve considered,\" Hawat said. \"Still. . . . \"\\n\\n The Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: Let him be suspicious. Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will make another man careless.\\n\\n \"What do you suggest?\" the Duke whispered.\\n\\n \"For now, constant surveillance, my Lord. She should be watched at all times. I will see it\u0027s done unobtrusively. Idaho would be the ideal choice for the job. Perhaps in a week or so we can bring him back. There\u0027s a young man we\u0027ve been training in Idaho \u0027s troop who might be ideal to send to the Fremen as a replacement. He\u0027s gifted in diplomacy.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"And what about Paul?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps we could alert Dr. Yueh.\"\\n\\n Leto turned his back on Hawat. \"I leave it in your hands.\"\\n\\n \"I shall use discretion, my Lord.\"\\n\\n At least I can count on that , Leto thought. And he said: \"I will take a walk. If you need me, I\u0027ll be within the perimeter. The guard can - \"\\n\\n \"My Lord, before you go, I\u0027ve a filmclip you should read. It\u0027s a first-approximation analysis on the Fremen religion. You\u0027ll recall you asked me to report on it.\"\\n\\n The Duke paused, spoke without turning. \"Will it not wait?\"\\n\\n \"Of course, my Lord. You asked what they were shouting, though. It was \u0027Mahdi!\u0027 They directed the term at the young master. When they - \"\\n\\n \"At Paul?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, my Lord. They\u0027ve a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern.\"\\n\\n \"They think Paul is this . . . this . . . \"\\n\\n \"They only hope, my Lord.\" Hawat extended a filmclip capsule.\\n\\n The Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket. \"I\u0027ll look at it later.\"\\n\\n \"Certainly, my Lord.\"\\n\\n \"Right now, I need time to . . . think.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, my Lord.\"\\n\\n The Duke took a deep sighing breath, strode out the door. He turned to his right down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying little attention to where he was. There were corridors and stairs and balconies and halls . . . people who saluted and stood aside for him.\\n\\n In time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep on the table with a guard\u0027s robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a pillow. The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony overlooking the landing field. A guard at the corner of the balcony, recognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped to attention.\\n\\n \"At ease,\" the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the balcony rail.\\n\\n A predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight overhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on the southern horizon, the night\u0027s second moon peered through a thin dust haze - an unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.\\n\\n As the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs, frosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill. He shivered.\\n\\n Anger shot through him.\\n\\n The Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time , he thought. They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I make my stand! And he thought with a touch of sadness: I must rule with eye and claw - as the hawk among lesser birds . Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic.\\n\\n To the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell opalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long, bell-tolling movement of dawn striking across a broken horizon.\\n\\n It was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention.\\n\\n Some things beggar likeness , he thought.\\n\\n He had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond the landing field where the night\u0027s faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of Arrakis, he saw great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an articulate tread of violet . . . like giant footsteps.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a beautiful morning. Sire,\" the guard said.\\n\\n \"Yes, it is.\"\\n\\n The Duke nodded, thinking: Perhaps this planet could grow on one. Perhaps it could become a good home for my son .\\n\\n Then he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them with strange scythe-like devices - dew gatherers. Water so precious here that even the dew must be collected.\\n\\n And it could be a hideous place , the Duke thought.\\n\\n \"There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man - with human flesh.\"\\n\\n - from \"Collected Sayings of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\\n The Duke said: \"Paul, I\u0027m doing a hateful thing, but I must.\" He stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference room for their breakfast. The thing\u0027s sensor arms hung limply over the table, reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.\\n\\n The Duke\u0027s attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky.\\n\\n Paul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen religious practices. The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat\u0027s experts and Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.\\n\\n \"Mahdi! \"\\n\\n \"Lisan al-Gaib! \"\\n\\n He could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. So that is what they hope , he thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother had said: Kwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose, shading this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand.\\n\\n \"A hateful thing,\" the Duke said.\\n\\n \"What do you mean, sir?\"\\n\\n Leto turned, looked down at his son. \"Because the Harkonnens think to trick me by making me distrust your mother. They don\u0027t know that I\u0027d sooner distrust myself.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand, sir.\"\\n\\n Again, Leto looked out the windows. The white sun was well up into its morning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled over into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.\\n\\n Slowly, speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to Paul about the mysterious note.\\n\\n \"You might just as well mistrust me,\" Paul said.\\n\\n \"They have to think they\u0027ve succeeded,\" the Duke said. \"They must think me this much of a fool. It must look real. Even your mother may not know the sham.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dune-dune-chronicles-1/page-6.html","bookId":2153,"book":{"id":2153,"title":"Dune (Dune Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Dune (Dune Chronicles #1) \\n Set in the far future amidst a sprawling feudal interstellar empire where planetary dynasties are controlled by noble houses that owe an allegiance to the imperial House Corrino, Dune tells the story of young Paul Atreides (the heir apparent to Duke Leto Atreides and heir of House Atreides) as he and his family accept control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the \"spice\" melange, the most important and valuable substance in the universe.
