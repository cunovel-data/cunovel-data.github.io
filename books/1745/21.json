No longer did she indulge in the coquettishness of shimmering transparent garments. She was dressed in somewhat more chaste tubular coverings, now. Her once lustrous black hair was streaked with gray, and she wore it cut much shorter. Andrew, though, had of course not changed at all. His face was as unlined as ever; his soft, fine hair was still brown. And he clung, as closely as he could within the limits of reasonable taste, to the loose style of clothing that had prevailed when he first adopted clothing over a century before. It was late in the year. The harsh chill winds of winter were blowing through the ancient canyons of New York and faint wisps of snow were swirling through the air above the giant gleaming tower that housed the World Legislature. The Legislature\u0027s wordy struggles were over for the season. But for Andrew the struggle never seemed to reach its end. The debate had gone on and on-the angry, baffled Legislators had tried to take all possible sides of the issue-the voting public, unable to come to any clear philosophical position, had fallen back on emotion, on primordial fear, on the deepest-rooted of uncertainties and prejudices Congresswoman Chee had withdrawn her bill, had modified it substantially to take into account the stubborn opposition that it had run into. But she had not yet offered it again to the Legislature. \"What do you think?\" Andrew asked. \"Will you introduce the revised bill in the new session or not?\" \"What do you want me to do?\" \"You know what I want you to do.\" Li-hsing nodded, a little wearily. \"I told you once, Andrew, that your cause was not really my cause, and that I might have to abandon it if I felt my career was at stake. Well, my career is at stake. And I still haven\u0027t abandoned you.\" \"And do you still feel that my cause isn\u0027t your cause?\" \"No. It has become my cause. I have no doubt that you are human, Andrew-perhaps made so by your own hand, but human all the same. And I understand that to deny the humanity of a single member of our kind is to raise the renewed possibility of denying humanity to whole multitudes, as was done all too often in our ugly past. We must never permit that to happen again. But even so-even so, Andrew-\" She faltered for a moment. \"Go on,\" Andrew said. \"Now comes the point where you tell me that you have to abandon me despite everything, isn\u0027t that right, Li-hsing?\" \"I didn\u0027t say that. But we have to be realistic. I think we\u0027ve gone as far as we can go.\" \"So you won\u0027t introduce the revised bill.\" \"I didn\u0027t say that, either. I intend to give it one more try after recess. But to be honest, Andrew, we can\u0027t win. Look at the numbers.\" She touched a button and a screen came to life on the wall of her office. \"The group on the left side of the chart, the section in green-those are the members who are unalterably opposed to any kind of loosening of the definitions. That\u0027s just about 40% of the Legislature: immovable, permanently committed to opposing you. The segment marked in red: there are your supporters. 28%. The rest are the undecided ones.\" \"In two different colors? Why is that?\" \"Yellow is the group that\u0027s undecided but leaning in your direction. That\u0027s a 12.5% slice. Blue is undecided against you. That\u0027s 19.5%.\" \"I see.\" \"In order to get a majority, we need to keep every single one of the undecideds in the yellow slice of the chart, and win over more than half of those who are still on the fence but currently thinking of voting against you. Plus, of course, retaining the solid support of your basic 28% group. Even if we can manage to win over a few of your diehard opponents, I don\u0027t think we can put together the vote, Andrew.\" Andrew said, \"Then why bother even bringing the bill up for debate?\" \"Because I owe you that much. As you can see, it isn\u0027t going to work, and I\u0027m afraid this is going to be my last try. Not because I\u0027m walking away from the fight-not at all-but because I\u0027m not going to be in a position any longer where I can stay in it. Everything that I\u0027ve been doing on your behalf is going to be wrapped around my neck at the next election and it\u0027s going to pull me down to defeat. I have no doubt of that. I\u0027m going to lose my seat.\" \"I know,\" said Andrew, \"and it distresses me. For your sake, not for mine. You saw it coming long ago, didn\u0027t you, Li-hsing? And yet you stayed with me. Why? Why, after telling me at the start that you\u0027d drop me if you found that I was endangering your career? Why didn\u0027t you?\" \"One can change one\u0027s mind, you know. Somehow, Andrew, abandoning you involved paying a higher price than I was willing to pay for the sake of winning just one more term. As it is, I\u0027ve been in the Legislature for over a quarter of a century. That\u0027s long enough, I think.\" \"But if your mind could change, why not the minds of the others?\" \"We\u0027ve changed all that are amenable to reason. The rest-and it\u0027s a majority of them, I\u0027m sorry to say-simply can\u0027t be moved. It\u0027s a matter of deep-rooted emotional antipathy.\" \"Theirs, or the people who voted for them?\" \"Some of each. Even those members of the Legislature who are more or less rational themselves tend now and then to assume that their constituents aren\u0027t. But I\u0027m afraid that plenty of them have powerful antipathies of their own, when it comes to anything robotic.\" \"And is relying on emotional antipathy a valid way for a Legislator to decide how to vote?\" \"Oh, Andrew-\" \"Yes. How terribly naive of me to say a thing like that.\" \"Naive isn\u0027t the right word. But you know that they\u0027d never admit they were voting their emotions. They\u0027d offer this or that carefully reasoned-out explanation for their decision-something about the economy, or an analogy from Roman history, or some antiquated religious argument-anything but the truth. But what does it matter? It\u0027s how they\u0027ll vote that counts, not why they do it.\" \"It all comes down to the question of the structure of the brain, then-isn\u0027t that so?\" \"That\u0027s the problem, yes.\" Andrew said cautiously, \"I don\u0027t see why that should be such a sticking point for them. What a brain is made of isn\u0027t the essential thing: it\u0027s how the brain functions. Its thought patterns, its reaction time, its ability to reason and to generalize from experience. Why does the whole issue have to be drawn down to the level of organic cells versus positrons? Is there no way of pushing through a functional definition?\" \"Functional?\" \"My brain does everything that an officially legal human brain can do -does it better, in many ways, faster, more directly, more logically. Perhaps that\u0027s what bothers them. Well, it\u0027s too late for me to start hiding my intelligence, if that\u0027s the problem. But must we go on insisting that a human brain has to be made of some officially approved cellular substance in order to be legally human? Can\u0027t we simply stipulate that a human brain is something-anything, organic or not-that is capable of attaining a certain complex level of thought?\" \"It won\u0027t work,\" said Li-hsing. \"Because if we defined humanity by brain function alone, too many humans would fall below the stipulated level of intellectual ability?\" Andrew asked bitterly. \"Is that it?\" \"Andrew, Andrew, Andrew! Listen to me: there are those who are determined to keep a barrier up between themselves and robots at any cost. For the sake of their own self-esteem, if nothing else, they want to believe that they belong to the only true and lawful human race and that robots are some sort of inferior creatures. You\u0027ve spent the past hundred years beating those people back, and you\u0027ve won your way through to a status that would have been utterly inconceivable in the early years of robotics. But now they\u0027ve got you on an issue where you can\u0027t win. You\u0027ve put yourself inside a body that for all intents and purposes is close enough to being human as makes no real difference. You eat, you breathe, you sweat. You go to fine restaurants and order splendid meals and drink the best wines, I\u0027ve noticed, though I can\u0027t imagine what value that can have for you other than for appearance\u0027s sake.\" \"That is value enough for me,\" said Andrew. \"All right. Plenty of humans probably can\u0027t appreciate the expensive wines they drink either, but they drink them all the same, and for the same reason you do. Your organs are all artificial, but by now so are many of theirs. Quite possibly there are people out there living in bodies that are virtually identical to yours, wholesale artificial replacements for the ones they were born with. But they aren\u0027t complete replacements, Andrew. Nobody has a prosthetic brain. No one can. And so you differ from everyone else in one fundamental respect. Your brain is man-made, the human brain is not. Your brain was constructed, theirs was naturally developed. They were born, you were assembled. To any human being who is intent on keeping up the barrier between himself and robots, those differences are like a steel wall five kilometers high and five kilometers thick.\" \"You aren\u0027t telling me anything I don\u0027t know. My brain is different in composition from theirs, certainly. But not in its function, not really. Quantitatively different, maybe, but not qualitatively. It\u0027s just a brain-a very good brain. They\u0027re merely using the positronic-vs. cellular issue as a pretext to keep from admitting that what I am is a human being of a kind somewhat different from them. -No, Li-hsing, if we could somehow get at their antipathy toward me because of my robotic origins-the very source of all their hostility-this mysterious need they have to proclaim themselves superior to someone who is by every reasonable definition superior to them-\" \"After all your years,\" said Li-hsing sadly, \"you are still trying to reason out the human being. Poor Andrew, don\u0027t be angry at me for saying this, but it\u0027s the robot in you that drives you in that direction.\" \"You know that there\u0027s very little left of the robot in me by this time.\" \"But there\u0027s some.\" \"Some, yes. And if I were to get rid of that-\" Chee Li-hsing shot him a look of alarm. \"What are you saying, Andrew?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"But I have an idea. The problem is, Li-hsing, that I have human feelings trapped within a robot mind. But that doesn\u0027t make me human, only an unhappy robot. Even after all that has been done to improve my robot body, I\u0027m still not human. But there\u0027s one more step that can be taken. If I could bring myself-if I could only bring myself-\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-positronic-man-robot-0-6/page-21.html","bookId":1745,"book":{"id":1745,"title":"The Positronic Man (Robot #0.6)","description":"Storyline: The Positronic Man (Robot 0.6) by Isaac Asimov, Robert Silverberg In a twenty-first century Earth where the development of the positronic brain has revolutionized the way of life, beloved household robot \"\"Andrew\"\" struggles with his unusual capacity for emotion and dreams of becoming human.
