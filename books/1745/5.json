{"id":70696,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"MISS HAD BEGUN to cross the threshold that truly separates girlhood from womanhood, now. She was enjoying an active social life and going off with her new friends-not all of them girls-on excursions to the mountains, to the deserts of the south, to the wilderness to the north. Her presence in the Martin house was becoming an increasingly rare event.\n So it was Little Miss-not as little as before-who filled Andrew\u0027s horizon now. She was turning into a coltish, tireless girl who loved to run great distances along the beach, with Andrew effortlessly keeping pace beside her. She went rambling in the forested areas adjacent to the house, and relied on Andrew to help her down when she had scrambled a little too far up some tree to peer into a bird\u0027s nest, or when she had trapped herself on some precarious rocky ledge that she had climbed for the sake of getting a better view of the sea.\n As ever, Andrew was vigilant and endlessly protective as Little Miss romped about. He would let her take her little tomboyish risks, yes, because they seemed to make her happy, but not without his calculating the real risk of anything serious happening to her, and he was always poised and ready to intervene swiftly on her behalf if that should be necessary.\n The First Law, of course, compelled Andrew to exert constant diligence to protect Little Miss from harm. But, as he sometimes told himself, he would willingly and gladly defend her against peril of any sort even if the First Law did not exist.\n That was an odd thought: that there might be no First Law. Andrew could barely conceive of that The First Law (and the Second, and the Third) were such fundamental aspects of his neural pathways that it made him dizzy to imagine himself without them. And yet he had imagined it. Andrew was puzzled by that: how strange, having a capacity to imagine the unimaginable! It made him feel almost human, when paradoxical concepts like that went through his mind.\n But what did almost human mean? That was another paradox, and an even more dizzying one. Either you were human or you were not How could there be any sort of intermediate state?\n You are a robot, Andrew reminded himself sternly.\n You are a product of the United States Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation.\n And then Andrew would look at Little Miss and a sensation of great joy and warmth would spread through his positronic brain-a sensation that he had come to identify as \"love\"-and he would have to remind himself, allover again, that he was nothing more than a cleverly designed structure of metal and plastic with an artificial platinum-iridium brain inside his chrome-steel skull, and he had no right to feel emotions, or to think paradoxical thoughts, or to do any other such complex and mysterious human thing. Even his woodworking art-and he did allow himself to think of it as \"art\"-was simply a function of the skills with which he had been programmed by his designers.\n Little Miss never allowed herself to forget that the very first piece of woodcarving Andrew had done had been for her. She was rarely without the little pendant that he had made for her out of that piece of driftwood, wearing it on a silver chain about her neck and reaching up to finger it fondly again and again.\n It was she who first objected to Sir\u0027s casual habit of giving away Andrew\u0027s productions to anyone who visited the house. He would proudly show his guests Andrew\u0027s latest work, and then, when the predictable expressions of admiration and even envy were uttered, would grandly exclaim, \"Do you really like it that much? Then take it with you! By all means, take it! My pleasure! There are plenty more where that one came from!\"\n One day Sir bestowed a particularly intricate abstract carving-a shining spheroid made of slender interwoven strips of redwood with inlays of manzanita and madrone wood-on the Speaker of the Legislature. The Speaker was a loud-voiced red-faced man who had always seemed particularly dull-witted and vulgar to Little Miss, and she very much doubted that he had any ability to see the beauty in Andrew\u0027s work. No doubt he was simply being diplomatic when he had praised the carving, and he would simply toss it thoughtlessly into some closet when he got it home.\n Little Miss said, after the Speaker had left, \"Come on, Dad. You shouldn\u0027t have given that to him and you know it!\"\n \"But he liked it, Mandy. He said he thought it was extremely beautiful.\"\n \"It is extremely beautiful. So is the beach in front of our house. If he said the beach was extremely beautiful, would you have deeded it over to him?\"\n \"Mandy, Mandy-\"\n \"Well? Would you?\"\n \"It\u0027s a false parallel,\" Sir said. \"Obviously you don\u0027t go handing away chunks of your real estate to people on a whim. But a small carving-given as a modest expression of affection to a friend of many years\u0027 standing who also happens to be a highly influential political leader-\"\n \"Are you saying it was a bribe?\"\n For an instant real anger flashed in Sir\u0027s eyes. But it died away almost as fast as it had come and the usual twinkle with which he regarded his youngest daughter returned.\n \"You don\u0027t really mean that, do you, Mandy? You understand that my gift to the Speaker was merely an act of hospitality, right?\"\n \"Well-yes. Yes. I\u0027m sorry, Dad. What I said was uncalled-for and mean.\"\n Sir smiled. \"It was, yes. -Is it that you wanted that carving for yourself? Your room is already filled with things that Andrew has made, you know. The whole house is. We can\u0027t give them away as fast as he makes them.\"\n \"That\u0027s the whole point I was trying to make. That you give them away.\"\n Sir\u0027s smile grew broader. \"Well, what would you prefer that I do? Sell them to people?\"\n \"As a matter of fact, yes. That\u0027s exactly what I would prefer.\"\n Sir said, looking astonished, \"It isn\u0027t like you to be greedy, Mandy.\"\n \"What does greed have to do with this?\"\n \"Surely you must understand that we already have more than enough money. Quite apart from the complete impropriety of my putting a price tag on some object that a guest in my house might happen to admire, it would be absurd for me to go in for trivial profiteering of any such kind.\"\n \"I\u0027m not saying that we should try to make money on the things Andrew carves. But what about Andrew?\"\n \"What about him?\"\n \"He does the work. He should have the money.\"\n Sir blinked. \"Andrew\u0027s a robot, Mandy.\"\n \"Yes, I know that, Dad\"\n \"Robots aren\u0027t people, sweet. They\u0027re machines, remember? Like telephones, like computers. What imaginable use would a machine have for money? Robots don\u0027t go shopping. Robots don\u0027t take holidays in Hawaii. Robots don\u0027t-\"\n \"I\u0027m serious, Dad. This is an important issue. Andrew spent hours making that.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"Robot or not, he\u0027s got the right to benefit from the results of his labor. When you coolly hand out the things he makes as gifts to your friends or political associates, the way you do, you\u0027re exploiting him, did you ever stop to think of that, Dad? He may be a machine but he\u0027s not a slave. And also he\u0027s an artist. He\u0027s entitled to be compensated for making those things. Maybe not when he makes them for us, but when you give them away like that to other people-\" Little Miss paused. \"Do you remember the French Revolution, Dad? -No, I don\u0027t mean do you remember it literally. But its basic issue was the exploiting of the working classes by the aristocracy. Robots are our new working classes. And if we go on treating our robots the way the dukes and duchesses treated their peasants-\"\n Sir smiled gently.\n \"The last thing we need to worry about, Mandy, is an uprising by our robots. The Three Laws\"\n \"The Three Laws, the Three Laws, the Three Laws! I hate the Three Laws! You can\u0027t deprive Andrew of the benefit of the work he does. You can\u0027t! It isn\u0027t fait; Dad!\"\n The fury in Little Miss\u0027s voice cut off the rest of Sir\u0027s disquisition on the Laws of Robotics before he had barely managed to frame his words.\n He said instead, after a moment, \"You really feel strongly about this, don\u0027t you, Mandy?\"\n \"Yes. Yes, I do.\"\n \"All right. Let me think about it. And perhaps we can actually work something out for Andrew along the lines that you\u0027re suggesting.\"\n \"You promise?\"\n \"I promise,\" said Sir, and Little Miss knew that everything was going to be all right, for her father\u0027s promises to her were inviolable contracts -always had been, always would be.\n Some time went by, and other visitors came to the house, and everyone who saw Andrew\u0027s work responded with the usual praise. But Little Miss, who was watching closely, observed with pleasure that her father had stopped giving Andrew\u0027s things away, no matter how effusive the praise might be.\n On the other hand, it happened on several occasions that some guest would say, \"You don\u0027t think I could buy that from you, do you, Gerald?\" And Sir, looking uncomfortable, would simply shrug and reply that he wasn\u0027t quite sure whether he wanted to get into the business of selling such things.\n Little Miss wondered why her father was sidestepping the issue like that. Sidestepping things wasn\u0027t normally part of his nature. And it wasn\u0027t as though anyone was likely to accuse him of deliberately setting out to earn money by peddling Andrew\u0027s work to his house guests. Obviously Gerald Martin was in no need of picking up a bit of extra money on the side that way. But if the offers were made in good faith, though, why not accept them?\n She let the issue rest, nevertheless. She knew her father well enough to understand that the matter was still open, and would be attended to in due course.\n Then another visitor came: John Feingold, Sir\u0027s lawyer. The offices of Feingold\u0027s law firm were in the San Francisco area, where despite the general decentralization of city life that had been going on all during the current century a good many people still preferred to live. But though San Francisco was only a short journey south of the wild strip of coast where the Martins lived, a visit from John Feingold to the Martin house was a relatively unusual thing. Usually Sir went down to San Francisco whenever he had business to discuss with Feingold. So Little Miss knew that something special must be up.\n Feingold was an easy-going white-haired man with florid pink skin, a pudgy belly, and a warm, amiable smile. He preferred to dress in older styles of clothing and the rims of his contact lenses were tinted a bright green, a fashion so rare nowadays that it was all that Little Miss could do to keep from giggling whenever she saw the lawyer. Sir had to shoot her a stern glance now and then when he detected a fit of laughter coming over her in Feingold\u0027s presence.\n Feingold and Sir settled down before the fireplace in the great central room of the house and Sir handed him a small inlaid plaque that Andrew had produced a few days before.\n The lawyer nodded. He turned it over and over in his hand, rubbed its polished surface appreciatively, held it up to the light at various angles.\n \"Beautiful,\" he said, finally. \"Extraordinarily fine work, all right. Your robot did it?\"\n \"Yes. How did you know that?\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard some talk. It\u0027s no secret, Gerald, that you\u0027ve got a robot here who\u0027s a master craftsman in wood.\"\n Sir glanced up at Andrew, who was standing quietly in the shadows to one side. \"Do you hear that, Andrew? You\u0027re famous all up and down California. -But you\u0027re wrong about one thing, John. Andrew isn\u0027t simply a master craftsman. He\u0027s an out-and-out artist, nothing less.\"\n \"Indeed he is,\" Feingold said. \"That\u0027s the only word for him. This is a wonderful piece.\"\n \"Would you like to own it?\" Sir asked.\n Feingold\u0027s eyes widened in surprise. \" Are you offering it to me, Gerald?\"\n \"I might be. It all depends on how much you\u0027d be willing to pay for it.\"\n Feingold grunted as though Sir had poked him in the ribs with a rigid finger. He sat back sharply, rearranging himself with some care, and for a moment he did not reply.\n Then he said, in an entirely different voice, \"I hadn\u0027t been aware that you\u0027ve been undergoing financial reverses lately, Gerald.\"\n \"I haven\u0027t.\"\n \"Then-pardon me if I sound a little confused-why on Earth would you want to-\"\n His voice trailed off.\n \"Sell you that little carving?\" Sir finished for him.\n \"Yes. Sell it. I know you\u0027ve been giving away a great many of the things that Andrew has made. People have told me that it\u0027s practically impossible to come here without being offered something. I\u0027ve seen a few of the things that they\u0027ve been given. There\u0027s never been a question of money changing hands, am I right? And now-completely leaving out of the discussion the fact that I\u0027m not a collector of little wooden carvings, no matter how lovely they might be-you baffle me by asking me if I want to purchase one! Why? I doubt very much that you have any special reason for wanting me to pay for what everybody else gets free. And you can\u0027t possibly need the money. You\u0027ve just told me that yourself. In any event how much would you be able to get for an object like this? Five hundred dollars? A thousand? If you\u0027re still as wealthy as I know you to be, Gerald, what difference could the odd five hundred or thousand make to you?\"\n \"Not to me. To Andrew.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Your estimate happens to be right on the mark, John. I think I could get a thousand for this little thing. And I\u0027ve been offered rather more than that for chairs and desks that Andrew has made. Not just one-shot purchases but entire distribution deals for large-scale production. If I had accepted any of the offers, there\u0027d be a fine fat bank account built up by now, entirely on the proceeds of Andrew\u0027s woodworking-something up in the hundreds of thousands already, I suspect.\"\n Feingold fussed with his epaulets and collar-studs. \"Good heavens, Gerald, I can\u0027t make any sense out of any of this. A rich man making himself richer by putting his robot to work in some sort of cottage industry-\"\n \"I\u0027ve already told you, John, that the money wouldn\u0027t be for me. This is all for Andrew\u0027s sake. I want to start selling his products and I want the money to be banked under the name of Andrew Martin.\"\n \"A bank account in the name of a robot?\"\n \"Exactly. And that\u0027s why I\u0027ve asked you to come up here today. I want to know whether it would be legal to establish an account in Andrew\u0027s name-an account that Andrew himself would control, you understand, entirely his own money, which he would be able to use absolutely as he pleases-\"\n Feingold said, sounding mystified, \"Legal? For a robot to earn and save money? I just couldn\u0027t say. There are no precedents, so far as I\u0027ve ever heard. I doubt that there\u0027s any law against it, but even so-robots aren\u0027t people. How can they have bank accounts, then?\"\n \"Corporations aren\u0027t people either, except in the most abstract sense: a legal fiction, as you would term it. Yet corporations have bank accounts.\"\n \"Well, I grant you that. But corporations have been recognized in the eyes of the law for centuries as entities qualified to own property of all sorts. Robots, Gerald, have no legal rights at all, as surely you must be aware. And simply as a procedural matter, let me remind you that corporations also have corporate officers, and they sign the papers that establish the bank accounts. Who would open Andrew\u0027s account? You? And would it be Andrew\u0027s account, if you opened it?\"\n \"I\u0027ve opened bank accounts in the names of my children,\" Sir replied. \"Nevertheless the accounts are theirs. Besides, Andrew can sign his name as well as you or I.\"\n \"Yes. Yes, of course, I suppose he can.\" Feingold leaned back until his chair creaked. \"Let me think, Gerald. This is all so unusual. Is there really any legislation specifically forbidding robots to own property, or is it simply assumed that they can\u0027t, because the idea is so far from the main stream that nobody\u0027s ever given a thought to it? I\u0027d have to research it before I could give you an opinion. Quite possibly there are no such laws, precisely because a robot having assets is such a peculiar notion that it hasn\u0027t been deemed necessary to give it any consideration. Nobody has bothered to pass laws forbidding trees to have bank accounts, after all, or lawnmowers-\"\n \"Cats and dogs have had bank accounts. Trust funds for their upkeep, left to them by their loving owners,\" Sir said. \"The courts have no objection to that.\"\n \"Another good point, yes. Although cats and dogs are living creatures, at least. Robots are inanimate.\"\n \"I don\u0027t see what difference that makes.\"\n \"You ought to bear in mind, Gerald, that there\u0027s a certain prejudice against robots in our society, a certain fear, I might almost say, that doesn\u0027t extend to cats and dogs. It might well be that someone has put laws on the books restricting the rights of robots to hold property. But that\u0027s easily enough checked. -Let\u0027s assume that it is legal. How would you go about it? Take Andrew down to the bank and let him speak to the manager?\"\n \"I\u0027d simply have the forms sent here for Andrew\u0027s signature. There shouldn\u0027t be any need for a personal appearance on his part. But what I need to find out from you, John, is what I can do to protect Andrew-and myself, I suppose-against negative public reaction. Even though it may well be legal for him to have a bank account, there probably will be people who aren\u0027t going to like the idea.\"\n \"How will they find out?\" Feingold asked.\n \"How will we keep them from finding out?\" said Sir. \"If someone buys an item from him and makes a check payable to Andrew Martin, say-\"\n \"Um. Yes.\" Feingold\u0027s gaze seemed to turn inward for a moment. Then he said, \"Well, one thing we could do is to set up a corporation to handle all finances in his name-a corporation with a nice impersonal name, something like West Coast Wood Artistry, Ltd.-and Andrew can be the president and sole stockholder, though we could make ourselves members of the board of directors. That will place a layer of legalistic insulation between him and the hostile world. It ought to be enough, Gerald. Whenever Andrew wants to purchase something, he can simply draw a salary from the corporation treasury. Or declare a dividend for himself. The fact that he\u0027s a robot won\u0027t have to be a matter of public record. The incorporation forms will only need the names of the stockholders-not their birth certificates. Of course, he\u0027ll have to begin filing income tax returns. But the revenue people aren\u0027t going to come around to find out whether Taxpayer Andrew Martin is a human being or not. All they\u0027ll care about is whether Taxpayer Martin pays his taxes on time.\"\n \"Good. Good. Anything else?\"\n \"Not that I can think of offhand. If I come up with anything else once I\u0027ve run a search for precedents, I\u0027ll let you know. But I suspect it\u0027s going to work. Nobody\u0027s likely to stop you so long as you go about things quietly and obey the absolute letter of the corporation law. And if anyone does find out what\u0027s going on and doesn\u0027t like it, well, it\u0027ll be up to them to take action against you to stop it-provided they can show that they\u0027ve got legal standing to intervene.\"\n \"And if someone does, John? Will you take the case if a suit is brought against us?\"\n \"Certainly. For an appropriate retainer.\"\n \"What would be appropriate, do you think?\"\n Feingold smiled. \"Something along the lines of that,\" he said, and pointed to the wooden plaque.\n \"Fair enough,\" said Sir.\n \"Not that I\u0027m a collector, you understand. But it does have a certain artistic appeal.\"\n \"Indeed it does,\" said Sir.\n Feingold chuckled and turned to the robot. \" Andrew, you\u0027re going to be-well, not a rich man, but a rich robot. Does that please you?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"And what do you plan to do with all the money you\u0027re going to make?\"\n \"Pay for things, sir, which otherwise Sir would have had to pay for. It would save him expense, sir.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-positronic-man-robot-0-6/page-5.html","bookId":1745,"book":{"id":1745,"title":"The Positronic Man (Robot #0.6)","description":"Storyline: \n The Positronic Man (Robot 0.6) \n by Isaac Asimov, Robert Silverberg \n In a twenty-first century Earth where the development of the positronic brain has revolutionized the way of life, beloved household robot \"\"Andrew\"\" struggles with his unusual capacity for emotion and dreams of becoming human.
