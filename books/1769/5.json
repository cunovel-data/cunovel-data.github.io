Already she had destroyed several worlds, for the more people she infected through sex and bloodletting, the longer she lived, keeping the disease at a minimum inside her own body. Same with her army. Same with Nolan. If they didn\u0027t pass the disease on to someone else, and then someone else, and then someone else, they too became cannibals.\\n\\n It was a vicious cycle.\\n\\n \"You ready for this?\" Dallas asked. \"Lay it on me.\"\\n\\n \"Nolan escaped AIR.\"\\n\\n Okay. No, he hadn\u0027t been ready for that. \"Shit. How long ago?\" Dallas glanced at the clock hanging on the wall. \"About fifteen hours.”\\n\\n “And no one realized until this afternoon when Mia called the meeting?”\\n\\n “That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"How is that possible?\" The guy had been locked in a state-of-the-art facility, complete with fingerprint IDs, retinal scanners, and weight- and heat-sensitive tiles, all of which should have caused the alarms to screech to life the moment he stepped outside his cell. Again, \"should have\" sucked ass.\\n\\n \"God only knows. He\u0027s out there, probably screwing his way to good health while infecting innocent women, who then infect their lovers. If that\u0027s the case, this thing is going to spread fast. So fast we might not be able to stop it.\"\\n\\n Devyn placed the now-empty beer bottle atop the stack of unfolded laundry beside him. \"Think the Schön will want revenge against Jaxon and Mishka?\"\\n\\n Mishka, the cyborg Devyn wanted a go at but wouldn\u0027t make a play for because he did not poach his friend\u0027s females, ever, had befriended and betrayed Nolan, all to protect Jaxon. Saving the world from that sadistic disease by locking Nolan away had been a side benefit.\\n\\n \"Revenge?\" Dallas shrugged. \"He didn\u0027t seem the type, you know? He was more concerned about falling in love before he died than truly hurting others. I mean, I got the sense that he didn\u0027t enjoy infecting his lovers and only did it to survive.\"\\n\\n Love. Devyn barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes. Love could be found in the arms of anyone, anywhere, if only people would abandon the silly idea of monogamy. What was the point of giving yourself to only one? Boredom, that\u0027s what.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m guessing a patrol has been sent out to look for him,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Correct. So far, no sighting. Who knows? Maybe I\u0027m wrong, and he\u0027s not out there screwing everyone he meets. Maybe he\u0027s keeping to himself, hoping to die with a little dignity. You know, without an AIR audience. Or maybe he caught a solar flare home.\" Solar flares were what opened the wormholes that allowed the travel between the planets. That was how Devyn so easily moved between this one and his own. \"There\u0027s been no new case of infection.\"\\n\\n \"None that have been reported, at least.\" One thing Devyn knew about those in power: they kept secrets. Many women could have been infected by Nolan and eliminated by the government already.\\n\\n And one thing Devyn knew about men: they liked to have sex. Nolan needed sex more than most, not just for pleasure but for survival. He was sleeping around, keeping himself strong, no doubt about it. There would be no dying with dignity.\\n\\n \"Nolan didn\u0027t return to his planet,\" Devyn said. \"It was wiped, remember? All of its people were either infected or killed. And then, of course, the infected traveled to Eden\u0027s planet, Raka, wiped it, then ventured here. We have to catch him, and we have to kill him this time.\"\\n\\n Dallas shook his head. \"We can\u0027t kill him. He\u0027s the only one who knows about the Schön queen we\u0027ll soon be fighting. Speaking of, I wish there was a way to send the bitch a message. Come here, and we\u0027ll hang you with your own intestines.\"\\n\\n Devyn, too. \"We\u0027ve questioned Nolan repeatedly. Hell, I even tortured him. He never broke and managed to keep every one of his secrets. And the fault was not mine. I\u0027m a damn good torturer.\" It wasn\u0027t something he usually enjoyed, but he\u0027d been the only one for the job. Touching Nolan hadn\u0027t been an option. Spilling his blood hadn\u0027t been an option, either. The disease inside his body was alive, with a will and agenda of its own, and it only left a host when another was nearby.\\n\\n Devyn had not wanted to become one of those hosts. As he could force objects to move in the same way he could force people, manipulating their energy, he\u0027d been able to shatter every bone inside Nolan\u0027s body without ever setting foot in the room.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s time to end him,\" he added, \"before he begins a pandemic.\" Dallas scoured a hand down his tired face. \"That\u0027s what we decided, as well.\" Wait—what? \"Then why the hell\u0027d you hassle me about keeping him alive for his secrets?\"\\n\\n \"Mishka spent an hour trying to talk us out of killing him. She cried, Dev. Real damn tears.\" The agent leaned his head against the back of the couch, staring up at the ceiling. No one was tougher than Mishka, who had once had a chip in her brain. A chip that had forced her to do things she hadn\u0027t wanted to do. Murder people she loved, have sex with people she didn\u0027t. Only recently had it been removed. \"I wanted to cut out my heart and give it to her. Now you waltz in here, late, and state as pretty as you please the very thing we had to fight her for.\"\\n\\n \"One, I\u0027m late for everything but what really matters. And two, had I been here, we both know her tears wouldn\u0027t have affected me.\" Tears never affected him. It was almost like he was missing the sensitivity gene or something. For sex, he could pretend like he cared that he\u0027d upset a female. But actually care? No. Emotions, he\u0027d learned from ruling his people and being responsible for their fates, were foolish. Wasted, even. \"Now, why don\u0027t you tell me what this is really about.\"\\n\\n Silence. Thick, heavy. Then Dallas laid his arm over his eyes and said, \"It\u0027s Kyrin. Ever since he saved my life, there\u0027s been a desire to please him inside me—and it\u0027s not from gratitude! Anything he says, I feel compelled to do on a cellular level. Like the blood inside me knows it used to belong to him and wants to cater to his every whim.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re talking as though the blood is alive, as with the Schön.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it is. I mean, if Kyrin told me to blow him, I\u0027d blow him, even though I don\u0027t swing that way. And yeah, I know he\u0027d never command me to do something like that, but still. I can\u0027t stand even the possibility of it.\"\\n\\n \"Shall I kill him for you?\" Devyn\u0027s loyalty belonged to this man, not to the Arcadian. Dallas had broken several AIR rules for him, placing his own career and future in jeopardy. He\u0027d even saved Devyn\u0027s life, jumping in the way and taking a blade meant for Devyn. Of course, the agent\u0027s new Arcadian blood had caused him to heal quickly, but that hadn\u0027t lessened the impact of the gesture.\\n\\n More than that, Devyn liked him. Dallas had no inhibitions, and he was as open as Devyn was about his sexuality. Those blue eyes never judged him, and the man himself had been as desperate for a friend as Devyn had been. Mia, his last BFF, was now dating the very man responsible for Dallas\u0027s gifts—and torment.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d do that for me?\" Dallas asked.\\n\\n \"Of course.\" Yes, Devyn respected the enigmatic Kyrin and would hate to see him eliminated. And yes, anyone who could put up with the violent Mia Snow for more than a single bedding deserved his respect. But if Dallas wanted Kyrin gone, Devyn would take care of it, no questions asked. He owed him that much. At least.\\n\\n Wasn\u0027t like he got all emotional about his kills. To be honest, he could eliminate almost anyone with no hesitation and no sense of remorse. He\u0027d been that way since defeating his sexual shame. With its fall, his other emotions had seemed to crumble as well. He didn\u0027t cry. Ever, for any reason. He didn\u0027t become attached to people, places, or objects, in the sense that he craved them, needed them, and had to be with them. And he certainly didn\u0027t mourn when those around him kicked it.\\n\\n Perhaps, though, he wouldn\u0027t tear the otherworlder\u0027s limbs from his body and choke him to death with his own hands, as was Devyn\u0027s custom. Perhaps, too, he wouldn\u0027t sneak up from behind and slice his throat. He was fond of doing that, as well. Maybe he would challenge the alien to a fight, win, of course, and then bury the body and pretend like nothing had happened. It was the only honorable thing to do, really.\\n\\n \"No,\" Dallas said on a sigh. \"Don\u0027t kill him.\"\\n\\n \"Bummer. I had just come up with a gold star plan, if I do say so myself.\" Devyn knew why Dallas had declined his offer. Dallas still loved Mia like a sister, and Mia loved Kyrin. The agent would never do anything to hurt her, which meant he\u0027d never do anything to hurt his new blood master, no matter how much it might beleaguer him. \"You change your mind, you let me know and it\u0027s done.\"\\n\\n Dallas straightened, some of the tension leaving him. He even gifted Devyn with one of his wry—so rare these days—smiles. \"Just for that, I forgive you for being late.\"\\n\\n \"Does that mean you\u0027re not breaking up with me?\"\\n\\n Snorting, Dallas launched a pillow at him. \"You could be so lucky.\"\\n\\n The small square of material slammed into his chest. Devyn collected it and propped it behind his head, getting comfortable. But damn it, what the hell was still poking him in the back? Finally he reached back, fingers wrapping around ... a vibrator. He blinked at it. Large, pink, and beaded.\\n\\n \"Want to explain this?\" he said, holding it up to the light and smiling.\\n\\n His friend shrugged sheepishly. \"Had a girl over and we had a three-way with it.\"\\n\\n \"Wait a second.\" Devyn tossed the device to the floor and peered over at. the agent in disbelief. \"Back up. Two things shock me about your story. One, you actually brought a female into this dump? And two, you had a three-way yet you\u0027re still moody? Sounds like you need a few lessons in ménage etiquette.\"\\n\\n Dallas shot him the bird.\\n\\n \"You wish. Okay, subject change before you start slobbering on yourself over the possibility. When do we start hunting Nolan?\"\\n\\n \"Tonight. The others are out there now, and we\u0027re their relief.”\\n\\n “Let\u0027s not wait. I\u0027m bored.\"\\n\\n \"But I\u0027m tired. I worked all night and haven\u0027t had a chance to catch any Z\u0027s.”\\n\\n “Excuses, excuses. Man up, get off your ass and grab some weapons. We\u0027re going hunting.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 3\\n\\n Finally they caught sight of the bastard.\\n\\n Devyn remained in the shadows, back pressed against a wall of peeling red paint and metal. Fourteen days of flashing Nolan\u0027s picture to everyone they encountered, fourteen days of interviewing people who might have interacted with the poisonous alien. Fourteen days of passing out their cell numbers—and having to answer the calls of supposed sightings that were really women trying to date them—waiting for something, anything to break. Fourteen days of disappointment and failure. Until now. Nolan had come out of hiding to score a prostitute.\\n\\n Fitting, that sex would be the man\u0027s downfall.\\n\\n They had to be careful, had to treat this situation like they were patient admirers and Nolan a skittish virgin. (Devyn happened to be very good at that.) Nolan could cloak himself with invisibility and disappear in the blink of an eye. It was a skill that had almost gotten several AIR agents killed the last time they\u0027d dealt with him, because it was nearly impossible to win a fight with a ghost.\\n\\n Earlier, before he\u0027d actually seen the little shit, Devyn had feared he\u0027d already made a wrong move, alerting Nolan to his intentions and causing the Schön to follow him. Every so often, he\u0027d felt as if someone was watching him, studying him. Waiting. Perhaps judging. That gaze had blistered him, seemingly alive with fury.\\n\\n It was as that fury had grown that he\u0027d begun to think that maybe it wasn\u0027t Nolan. Maybe it was the vampire. Bride. I\u0027ll come after you. I swear it, she\u0027d shouted heatedly. Once, he\u0027d even thought he\u0027d caught sight of her. But she\u0027d been blissfully, erotically naked, more curved than possible, all rose tinted skin, blood red nipples, and dark hair.\\n\\n Because he\u0027d caught this wondrous glimpse on a crowded public street, he\u0027d known he hadn\u0027t really seen her. He knew women. No matter their race, they didn\u0027t traipse around naked. (Much to his consternation.) There was simply too much shame involved. (Again, much to his consternation.)\\n\\n After that, though, he\u0027d begun to look for her. Which was odd. He\u0027d already dismissed her from his mind. Hadn\u0027t he? But he couldn\u0027t deny that a true glimpse of dark hair now sent his pulse racing. Pale skin caused moisture to flood his mouth. Green eyes caused his cock to harden painfully.\\n\\n And each time his body reacted to thoughts of her, he remembered the way she\u0027d rebuffed him. How she\u0027d wanted no part of his (magnificent) body. Not sexually, at least.\\n\\n His desire to see her, really see her, had increased.\\n\\n If he put the vastness of his sensual knowledge to work, would he be able to tempt her to his bed? He just didn\u0027t know, and every fiber of his being sparked with the challenge of finding out.\\n\\n He was going to have to find her, he decided. Surely she\u0027d succumb, just like everyone else, and he\u0027d stop thinking about her. Exactly as he\u0027d done with everyone else. Life was too precious to waste wondering if Bride\u0027s eyes would sparkle like emeralds when she came. If her nipples were really blood red. If she had any tattoos, birthmarks, or scars. The scars he might enjoy kissing all better. Or was kissing boo-boos an Earth custom she would hate? Had she been raised here on the surface? Or had she escaped the underground to avoid punishment for something? If so, why? And did that mean she would make love like a naughty little criminal?\\n\\n He had to know. The sooner he found her, he thought, the better.\\n\\n He\u0027d use the databases at AIR, of course, but would they be able to lead him to her? All he had was her first name. And what a strange name it was. Bride. Who had named her? Why had they named her that? Was she mated? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-5.html","bookId":1769,"book":{"id":1769,"title":"Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4)","description":"Storyline: Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4) \\n SHE HAS A BODY MADE FOR TEMPTATION...AND A KISS TO DIE FOR. \\n The war between otherworlders and humans changed Earth beyond recognition.
