Without its body.\"\n Now the corner of McKell\u0027s lip twitched, his anger fading. \"Appropriately, then. Now go dress, child.\" He waved a hand toward the entrance on the far right. \"I shall be waiting.\"\n That commanding tone had to chafe at Bride\u0027s independent nature, as did the \"child,\" and Devyn almost grinned. \"There\u0027s something else. You mentioned that the king\u0027s ability is mind reading.\"\n McKell nodded, his expression suddenly wary.\n \"I suspected as much, last time I was here. But if he reads minds, how are we to prevent him from learning what we know of Bride?\" As he spoke, he rubbed her back to assure her that no matter what, they would do what was needed to keep her safe.\n \"The king can only read direct thoughts. While in his presence, in the palace really, you must be careful not to think of what you\u0027ve learned here. I told you the truth only to warn and prepare you. If he even suspects, we are all doomed.\" A heavy sigh. \"He is not the same man you knew, Targon. Remember Fiona, the nefreti I mentioned? She abducted his brother, tortured him in the most vile of ways, and when she tired of him and returned the prince, he committed suicide. The king has not been the same since.\"\n Devyn wouldn\u0027t offer sympathy he didn\u0027t feel. He had not liked the prince, had considered him loathsome, always grabbing at the female servants, even hitting them. The bastard had probably deserved everything the one called Fiona had done to him.\n \"If the king is a mind reader, keeping me isn\u0027t an option for you, McKell,\" Bride piped up. \"No way the two of us can keep our secrets from the king forever.\"\n He shrugged, unconcerned. \"As I explained, memories can be erased. Once we have been bonded, we will remain in my home until it\u0027s done.\"\n Bride gasped. \"As if.\"\n Devyn stiffened. No one would be screwing with his female\u0027s mind. \"You risked a lot, bringing her here.”\n “I have craved her return for over eighty years. Imprisonment and death would be small prices to pay for having her here.\" There at the end, his voice had turned husky. \"Go on now. Change.\"\n Devyn\u0027s lips pulled back in a scowl. He didn\u0027t mind the vampire paying those prices, but he did mind Bride paying them.\n \"But I have so many more questions,\" Bride said with a pout. \"And I will answer them as I show you the rest of the underground.\"\n With those words, Devyn realized the warrior\u0027s purpose, the reason he\u0027d allowed Devyn into the underground without a fight and with utter confidence of success. McKell hoped to lure Bride into staying with the one thing Devyn could not give her: a city of vampires. The warrior hoped she would spurn Devyn\u0027s affections, beg the king to allow her to stay, and then discard Devyn and his blood.\n A sense of urgency filled him, a need to show Bride what he could give her. He pushed to a stand, dragging her with him. \"She will change, but I will go with her.\"\n McKell scowled at him. \"You will stay here with me, and I will answer any questions you have about the care one must take with vampire mates.\"\n Bastard. Offering something so tempting. \"My bad. Perhaps I didn\u0027t make myself clear. Where she goes, I go.\"\n Whatever the vampire saw in his expression caused him to nod stiffly.\n Devyn turned, automatically locking his enemy in place. A growl sounded behind him. He didn\u0027t release his hold until he and Bride were inside the bedroom.\n Then he waited, doing nothing, expecting McKell to storm inside, fangs bared. It never happened. Another shocker.\n Bride spun in a circle, her gaze eating up their new surroundings, and he could only pray she liked his home better. It came with him, after all.\n He took stock, as well. There was a bed of pillows and furs, two lace ribbons at the head and foot, perfect for a little game of bondage. An intricately carved vanity, a mirror, and all the things a woman could desire to pamper herself. A desk made of stone, weapons lining the wall—did the vampire not fear Devyn would take them?—and a closet filled with robes of every color.\n The entire enclosure reeked of the warrior.\n Devyn popped his jaw in irritation. \"He wanted you in here without me so that you\u0027ll smell of him when we visit the palace.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand why we need to visit the king. I\u0027m not going to let him decide for me.”\n “Have you made a decision, then?\"\n \"About what?\" she asked, pretending to be clueless.\n About me. About us. He didn\u0027t say that, however. There was another way to learn the answer he craved without sounding like a whiny, needy puss. \"Visiting the king is the only way to keep McKell from coming after you.\" Devyn drew her into his arms. \"Are you happy you came here?\"\n \"Yes. I needed to know what it was like.”\n “And?\" He kissed the top of her head, desperate to have his lips on her. Anywhere on her.\n \"It\u0027s not like I imagined it. The way that girl was treated ... the king wanting me dead ... destroying my mother...\" She shuddered.\n \"So ... you won\u0027t stay here?”\n “No. Probably not.\"\n Thank God. \"We need to figure a few things out, then. Like what to do if the king says you belong to the warrior, I honestly thought he\u0027d side with me because we\u0027re already bonded, already married.\" And yeah, he\u0027d even thought there was a possibility the king would try and force Devyn to stay here; to keep Bride safe, he\u0027d deemed the chance worth it. Not once had he ever thought the king would try and separate them. Until now. McKell\u0027s confidence...\n \"If he does, I\u0027ll just wish him into a pile of ash,\" she said. \"And if that doesn\u0027t work?\"\n \"I\u0027ll keep wishing until something does.\" She returned his embrace and rested her head in the hollow of his neck. Her breath was warm against his skin. \"Devyn,\" she said, and there was a hesitance to her tone he\u0027d never heard before. \"My mother is dead, and there\u0027s no way to return my memories of her. I don\u0027t even know her, but right now I miss her terribly.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, love. So sorry.\" He ran his hands up and down her spine, offering what comfort he could. \"My own mother was more concerned with her lovers than her child, so while I\u0027d willingly give you my memories, I don\u0027t think you\u0027d want them.\"\n \"Oh, Devyn. I\u0027m sorry.\" Her grip tightened around him. \"You should have been fawned over. I bet you were adorable.\"\n \"Were?\" he asked with mock offense.\n She uttered a warm, rich chuckle. \"Braggart. Macy says I\u0027m becoming just like you.”\n “And you\u0027re the better for it.\"\n That earned him another chuckle.\n He kissed her temple. \"Your mother wanted you alive and happy. More than anything else, even her own life.\" He cupped her chin and drew back, studying her. \"You can do that for her. You can give her that.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n Tears sprang in her eyes, turning them to liquid emeralds, and her bottom lip started trembling. Those tears ... He was struck with the urge to fight the Grim Reaper himself, anything to give her\n back her mother. He couldn\u0027t exist, knowing Bride was hurting. It destroyed him, more than the darkness ever had.\n What was worse, he couldn\u0027t tell her how much he thought he maybe might kinda sorta love her. Not yet. Not here. She might not believe him, thinking he said the words, those three earth shattering words, simply to convince her to leave with him, which could in turn make the contrary female angry enough to stay.\n He\u0027d never said \"I love you\" before. Not to his parents, and not to one of his many lovers. When he finally admitted his feelings, he wasn\u0027t sure what he\u0027d do in the face of doubt.\n How did she feel about him? She trusted him, desired him, but did she love him? \"You\u0027re killing me,\" he said. \"You know that, right?\"\n \"So the big strong warrior can\u0027t stand a woman\u0027s tears?\" With a shaky grin, she wiped her eyes with the back of her wrist. \"I\u0027ll make a note of it for the next time I want my way and you\u0027re acting like an ass.\"\n \"I knew you were smart, but this... recognizing how big and strong I am. Brilliant.\"\n Grinning, she pulled away from him and trekked to the closet, where she flipped through the robes. \"This is what the females wear all day?\"\n \"Oh, yes.\"\n \"Well, come help me pick something.\"\n Devyn happily closed the distance between them. Rather than reach around her and grab a green robe to match her eyes as he\u0027d intended, he cupped her breasts. \"My advice? The sexier the better.\"\n Her head fell against his shoulder, and she moaned. Her nipples hardened, deliciously abrading his palms. \"Are you doing this to cover me with your scent?\"\n \"That\u0027s merely a bonus. I\u0027m doing this because I can\u0027t not do it.\" He kissed her exposed neck as his hands delved to the waist of her pants, unzipped the clasp, and sank past her panties. \"It\u0027s been too long since I last had you.\"\n \"You should wait a bit longer,\" she said, but she didn\u0027t push his hand away. \"We should wait.\"\n He ground his erection into her lower cheeks. \"I won\u0027t tell McKell if you won\u0027t.\" It was difficult, but he kept some of his attention on the doorway. Any disturbance in the energy there, and he would kill whoever walked through the door.\n \"If his ears are as tuned as mine, he\u0027ll hear.\"\n \"Then you\u0027ll just have to be quiet this time, won\u0027t you, love?\" He sank two fingers inside her, his palm rubbing her just right.\n She groaned in pleasure.\n \"A sound. For shame. But how wet you are. So ready for me, hmm?\"\n \"Yes,\" she admitted on a wispy catch of breath. \"Need you. Now.\" Up and down her chest rose. Back and forth she writhed.\n He hadn\u0027t planned on taking her here, but he couldn\u0027t stop himself from undoing his pants and allowing his erection to pop free. He ripped the material gaping at her waist—she didn\u0027t need it anymore—stripping her luscious lower body. He kicked her legs apart, and then he was inside her, all the way home.\n Trembling, she cried his name. She even reached up and back, clutching his head, placing them cheek to cheek. In and out, he pounded, driving hard and fast.\n \"Bite me, love.\"\n \"No.\" A gasp, a groan of want. \"You need the blood.\"\n \"You need the strength.\"\n \"Drink a little. Just a little ...\" Temptation, so hard to resist.\n Her head turned, gaze latching onto his pulse. She licked her lips. \"Well... maybe.”\n “Do it. I need it. I need your teeth in me. Shall I beg? I will. I\u0027ll beg and plead and—\"\n With a hoarse moan, she bit him, those fangs sinking deep, that hot tongue caressing his vein and drawing the blood into her mouth. Oh, the pleasure. He rolled her clitoris between his fingers, increased the pace of his thrusts, sweating, hungry for climax, on fire at every point of contact, euphoric, on edge, desperate.\n She released him as she came, fangs emerging, fingers curling around the closet frame in front of her, nails scraping stone. Every muscle in her body tensed as her inner walls began milking him, squeezing tight. He roared, not even trying to be quiet, his hot seed jetting into her.\n They stood there panting for several minutes, sated, floating on a tide of bliss. Finally reason returned, and he forced himself to pull out of her. He used one of the robes to clean them both and tossed the material to the floor.\n Bride pivoted and faced him, though not really looking at him. Like butterfly kisses, she ghosted her fingertips over the puncture wounds in his neck. \"Shall I try and heal them with my blood?\"\n she\u0027d never offered before, and he realized it was because she\u0027d still, on some level, feared turning him into a vampire. \"No, leave them.\" He wanted the king to see. To know. \"I\u0027ll wear them with pride, for they prove I fed my woman.\"\n Her expression, already glazed with residual passion, softened. \"Devyn, I—\"\n \"No, don\u0027t say it.\" Now wasn\u0027t the time, whether she meant to discuss her feelings or ask him to slow things down. He kissed her hard and long, enjoying her sweet flavor. \"Dress. I\u0027m sure McKell is angry with us.\"\n Her head tilted to the side, ears twitching. \"He\u0027s pacing.\"\n \"And you\u0027re right. I\u0027m angry,\" the warrior snarled. He and Bride shared a smile. \"Dress,\" Devyn told her.\n Once more she spun toward the closet. She didn\u0027t bother flipping through the colors again, but snatched up the green. \"Your favorite, yes?\"\n Knew his preferences already, did she? Adorable female.\n She dressed slowly, her movements exaggerated for his benefit. When she finished, the silky material floated over her curves, leaving one delectable shoulder bare. \"How do I look?\"\n \"Breathtaking, as always,\" he said, surprised by the way his voice broke. \"Here. Let me.\" He picked a gold belt from the array hanging on the wall and wrapped it around her waist, cinching the material. There was a brush on the desk, and he grabbed it. The next five minutes he dedicated to smoothing out the tangles he had caused in her hair.\n She let him. He knew she needed time to mentally prepare herself for the tour they were about to take. A tour she\u0027d waited her entire life for, but one that would not be with her family. He simply enjoyed the moment, savoring the way the dark waterfall glimmered in the light. He could have done this for hours. Days.\n Finally he forced himself to set the brush aside. McKell\u0027s footfalls had grown thunderous. \"Ready?\" Reluctantly she nodded.\n \"Don\u0027t forget, love. I\u0027ll be with you every step of the way. Hand in hand, they rejoined McKell. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-36.html","bookId":1769,"book":{"id":1769,"title":"Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4) \n SHE HAS A BODY MADE FOR TEMPTATION...AND A KISS TO DIE FOR. \n The war between otherworlders and humans changed Earth beyond recognition.
