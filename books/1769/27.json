Her eyes had closed, her lashes casting shadows over her cheeks, and her teeth had sunk into her bottom lip. she\u0027d arched her back, sending him deeper inside her, and she\u0027d clawed at his flesh, lost in the bliss. She\u0027d panted his name, raspy and sweet, and it had felt like an embrace inside his ears. This time, her cries had not been laced with pain, so he\u0027d relished them all the more.\n Everything about her body pleased him. Her taste especially ...\n Once he had thought he wanted to taste a Rakan more than anything else in the world because they were supposedly like honey. But who cared about honey when nirvana was available? He\u0027d had Bride all over his face, down his throat, in his stomach, and it still hadn\u0027t been enough. Already he hungered for more.\n What was he going to do?\n He hadn\u0027t wanted another wife. He still didn\u0027t. But the fury was gone, and he did like the thought of having Bride in his house, at his beck and call. He grinned at that. Bride, catering to his every whim. As if she\u0027d really do what he told her to do when he told her to do it. Contrary female.\n So what was he going to do with her? What would happen when he tired of her or turned his attentions to someone else? And he would, he just knew it. He always did. Not that he\u0027d ever wanted a woman this intensely. Or for this long. Bride would still need his blood. Would die without it now, if the information he had was correct.\n \"We\u0027ve been laying here for, like, ever,\" Bride said, cutting into the silence. \"I\u0027m not a pansy like someone I know but out of courtesy won\u0027t name and in need of a nap. I just want to go home.\"\n \"For now, this is your home. And I am not a pansy. The nap was for your benefit.\" Of course, he ruined the boast by yawning.\n She twisted in his arms, facing him. Her eyes were luminous, her lips soft and redder than usual. Strands of hair were plastered to her temple. \"Sure you want to venture down that road of conversation right now?\"\n Meaning, she was going to argue about it. \"Cut me some slack, sweetheart. I\u0027m having trouble remembering my own name.\"\n At that, she grinned, slowly but sweetly. \"I don\u0027t know how you do it, Brad, but you\u0027re the only person on earth who can infuriate me one moment and have me laughing the next.\"\n Brad indeed. \"It\u0027s called animal magnetism, darling, and I have more than most.”\n “Oh, please.”\n “See. It even has you begging for more.\"\n She slapped his shoulder, but her grin didn\u0027t slip.\n Just then, it was as if they were friends as well as lovers. He ... liked it. Liked her relaxed and teasing. Too bad he was about to ruin the mood. \"Want to tell me where you were mentally while I had my face between your legs?\"\n That pretty grin faded, and he suddenly felt like punching something. \"No,\" she said, cheeks pinkening. \"I don\u0027t. Do you want to tell me what happened to your first marriage? Not that you\u0027re married again,\" she added hastily.\n At least she hadn\u0027t tried to pretend ignorance about her disappearing act. \"We\u0027ll exchange information, all right? I believe you remember the rules.\"\n At first, she gave no response; her gaze simply searched his face. Looking for what, he didn\u0027t know. Finally, she nodded. \"No bullshit about ladies first. This was your idea, so start talking.\"\n \"Fine. My wife.\" The shrew was his second least favorite subject. The first, of course, was his father. \"We were betrothed at birth and married at the age of fifteen. We—she\u0027d been raised to view sex as dirty, so we didn\u0027t get along. I left her.\" A glossed-over version, but the truth just the same, and easier to say than he\u0027d expected. \"Now it\u0027s your turn.\"\n Moaning, Bride flopped to her back and threw her arm over her forehead. \"You wanted to know where I was mentally while you were ... you know.\" She sighed. \"Well, you\u0027ve been with a lot of women.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never tried to deny it,\" he said as dread slid into his veins. He could guess where she was heading with this, and it didn\u0027t bode well for him.\n \"Well, I was feeling totally inadequate. How could I not, well, wonder how I compared to the others?\"\n Yep. His sigh mirrored hers. He\u0027d gone through this with a few others, and he\u0027d laughingly told them that no one compared to them. They had been words to soothe, to delight, and to move on to the loving. Here, now, he didn\u0027t want to utter such a claim. For once, he feared he might actually mean it. And if she realized that he meant it, would she then assume their marriage was forever? Probably.\n He couldn\u0027t let Bride wallow in feelings of inadequacy, though. That would be cruel. When have you ever cared about being cruel? He just liked her confident, he told himself. She was more fun that way.\n \"You confuse, fascinate, irritate, and delight me,\" he said, \"and I swear to God the only thing I was thinking about while tasting and touching you was you.\"\n A moment passed as she absorbed his words. She raised her chin and hooked her arms behind her head, raising one leg to study her onyx-painted toenails. \"Well, of course you were only thinking of me. I\u0027m the best thing that\u0027s ever happened to you.\"\n That\u0027s my girl. \"I guess I proved that by marrying you.\" Now why had he said that? She snorted. \"We aren\u0027t married, moron.\"\n \"Yes, we are.\" Stop, stop, stop. \"Why don\u0027t you tell me what you did for a living before scoring a sugar daddy?\"\n Another snort, but once again she twisted into him. This time she rested her head on his shoulder and began circling one of his nipples with her fingertips. \"Are you sure you want to know?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I stole, okay. I wasn\u0027t lazy or anything,\" she assured him. \"I was just afraid to take a job and spend time around humans. One, their smell sometimes makes me sick, and two, I was afraid they\u0027d notice the differences in me, start to question what I was. Three, I believe I\u0027ve mentioned that the sun is uncomfortable for me.\"\n \"Are you any good at stealing?”\n “Hello. I\u0027m the best.\"\n \"Guaranteed you aren\u0027t better than me, but do continue with your story.”\n “You steal things?\"\n \"The hearts of women across the universe. Ow!\" There at the end, she had pinched his nipple. \"No more of that, or you\u0027ll owe me a new one.\"\n She kissed it better, and he had to press his lips together to stop his groan. \"I started stealing full time to feed Al— Macy,\" she said. \"She was just a kid, left on the streets like a piece of garbage. I\u0027d never needed food, but she did, so I learned to get it for her. I\u0027d done some stealing for myself throughout the years, clothes, shoes, that sort of thing, but time hadn\u0027t been of the essence, so I\u0027d never really honed my skills. I just waited until an opportunity presented itself. With Macy, I couldn\u0027t wait and I wasn\u0027t always successful. Had a few run-ins with the law until I learned the best methods. After we were separated, I kept it up so I wouldn\u0027t be rusty when she returned. And well, I liked owning pretty things. What about you? What kind of childhood did you have?\"\n \"I was pampered,\" he said, each word measured. He prayed she left it at that. Not even Dallas knew about Devyn\u0027s parents, about the humiliating time spent inside that darkened cell. About his shame.\n She gave his nipple another kiss. \"That tells me nothing. Pampered doesn\u0027t mean happy.\"\n No, it didn\u0027t. But that kiss, so sweetly offered, without any demand for repayment, soothed the bleakness of his memories as nothing else ever had. Even sex. \"I was also ... repressed.\" Okay, that was enough of that. He quickly changed the subject, least he crumble and tell her everything. Would she be horrified if he did? Agree with his father that he was a bad, naughty boy in need of neutering? \"How often do you need to feed?\"\n \"To maintain top strength, I need to feed once a day, but I\u0027ve gone weeks without eating before. Well, without eating a full meal.\"\n And she\u0027d starved. That would not happen again. Not while she was with him. \"You\u0027ll feed once a day, and that\u0027s that.\"\n \"You won\u0027t be able to keep up. Who could? So I can—\"\n \"Hell, no, you won\u0027t,\" he interjected. \"I\u0027ll keep up,\" The thought of her drinking from anyone else roused the beast inside him. The thought of her enduring hunger pains because she didn\u0027t consider him able to give her more had the beast roaring. \"Besides, you can\u0027t keep anyone else\u0027s blood down.\"\n She huffed. \"That\u0027s not true. I told you, the first sips are absorbed before I sicken.\"\n \"Don\u0027t even try it, Bride.\" His teeth were so clenched he had trouble getting the words out. He might not want forever from her, but he damn well wanted right now. \"I swear to you now, I will kill anyone you drink from.\" Before she could comment, he sat up and tugged her with him. \"We need to shower. Come on.\"\n He stood, pulling her alongside him. Thankfully, she didn\u0027t protest. He linked their fingers and ushered her toward the stairs.\n \"We should put some clothes on, at least,\" she muttered halfway up. \"Why? We\u0027re alone. I gave the servants the day off.\" Her eyes widened as she peered up at him. \"You have servants?\"\n \"We have servants, and yes. Eight of them.\" They were all Arcadians, given to him by Kyrin en Arr. \"Have you slept with any of them?\"\n The question had held simple curiosity rather than anger. Did she not mind the thought of him with others? He popped his jaw. He\u0027d just threatened to kill anyone she drank from, yet she couldn\u0027t rouse a spark of jealousy?\n \"I\u0027d never had an Arcadian before, so I took four to bed the very first week I moved in.\" She laughed. Actually laughed. \"God, you\u0027re a slut.\"\n Seriously. Where was the jealousy? Why hadn\u0027t she demanded he fire the women immediately? \"You\u0027re okay with that? Me, with four different women, one after the other? Women who still live in this house with me?\"\n \"Why would I care? You\u0027re not sleeping with them now. Knowing you, you\u0027re already tired of the race. And as we already agreed, I\u0027m the best thing that\u0027s ever happened to you.\"\n Maddening, that\u0027s what she was. \"I\u0027ll give you a tour later.\" She didn\u0027t deserve one now. At the top of the staircase, he veered right, passed the first four doorways, and stopped at the end of the hall. A quick thumbprint ID, and the last entrance opened. \"This is our room.\"\n Bride gasped when she stepped inside, and he bit back a smile. Just the reaction he\u0027d been hoping for, he thought, suddenly filled with pride. The master suite was spacious, with a large bed covered in silk—real silk, not that fake shit— and mahogany furniture. There were mirrors on every wall, and portraits of naked females frolicking with each other.\n Bride inhaled deeply, closed her eyes. \"It smells wonderful in here.\"\n Not as good as you. He released her hand but wasn\u0027t able to sever all contact, so he wound an arm around her lower back, spreading his fingers wide to touch all of her that he could. His pinkie sank between her cheeks. She didn\u0027t protest. She wasn\u0027t so maddening, after all.\n \"Bathroom is this way.\" He had to lead her to keep her from running into things because she kept her head turned, studying the room in wonder.\n The bathroom was already open, and just as spacious. There was a claw-foot tub, a porcelain sink, and a shower stall with two waterspouts.\n Again, Bride gasped in wonder. \"My God. That\u0027s not... it isn\u0027t an enzyme stall.”\n “No.\"\n She faced him, trembling hands on his chest. His cock, already thickening and desperate for another go at her, brushed the cleft between her legs. \"Real water comes out?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n Her eyes closed, and an expression of utter ecstasy consumed her features. \"I haven\u0027t had one of those in sixty years or so.\"\n \"Let\u0027s not make you wait a second longer, then,\" he said huskily. He walked over to the stall and worked the knobs. A gust of water burst from the nozzle, stopped, and then a continuous spray emerged. Soon steam wafted, surrounding them.\n Bride didn\u0027t have to be commanded inside. She pushed Devyn out of the way and stepped into the water. A delighted laugh chimed from her as the water pummeled her, splashing into her hair and soaking its way down her body.\n Never had Devyn seen a more beautiful sight. She was an angel, a siren, and a goddess, all wrapped in Temptation\u0027s skin. Her joy was palpable, and he had given this to her, he thought, his pride intensifying.\n Water was expensive, but damn if he wouldn\u0027t spend his last cent buying it for her from this moment on. Until you tire of her, right? He stepped inside, and hot droplets beat against him, massaging his tired muscles.\n Their eyes met, and she gradually lost her grin. Her gaze slid to his penis. She gulped. Shivered.\n \"Ready for round two already, Bradley?\" Her nipples beaded, and the pulse at the base of her neck fluttered.\n \"Been ready. I\u0027ve just been waiting for you to catch up.\" She gave another of those delicious laughs.\n His cock jerked in reaction. \"Have you ever had sex in water?”\n “No. So let\u0027s change that, shall we?\"\n A few blissful hours later, Bride found herself standing in front of her—old?—apartment door, Devyn at her side. He\u0027d made love to her inside the shower, slowly, tenderly, but with an air of urgency she hadn\u0027t understood but had felt herself. She couldn\u0027t seem to get enough of him. How foolish was that? Soon her supply would be cut off, whether by Devyn or herself, and she\u0027d have to do without him. Wanting more was dumb.\n To be honest, she just couldn\u0027t see them lasting much longer. They liked each other now, sure, and the sex was amazing. Soon, though, someone else would come along and catch his notice. When that happened, she would leave. Bride absolutely refused to hang where she wasn\u0027t wanted. That feeling of inadequacy ... she shuddered. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-27.html","bookId":1769,"book":{"id":1769,"title":"Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4) \n SHE HAS A BODY MADE FOR TEMPTATION...AND A KISS TO DIE FOR. \n The war between otherworlders and humans changed Earth beyond recognition.
