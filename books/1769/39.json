{"id":73525,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"She had shown him what his life was missing. Then, with her smile and her touch, she\u0027d patched him up and made him whole.\n \"Remember when you painted us gold and had us pretend we were Rakans?\" De-Ella traced a finger along his collarbone. \"We had the McKell on the lookout, and when he found her, he bought her for us. Just in case you returned. Manus told us you would.\"\n Manus, the king. So. He\u0027d known all along that Devyn would return. But had he known why?\n \"Ladies.\" Bride rubbed at her chest as if pained. \"I tried to be nice, but you ruined it. Now I don\u0027t like you. You are going to back away from my husband.\"\n Her husband. It was the first time since their unexpected mating that she\u0027d said it, and his heart swelled. Mine. She\u0027s mine. Husband-was a title he\u0027d once endured, detested, suffered through, and when he\u0027d finally shed it, vowed never to take it up again. Now, for the second time in his life, he was a husband. This time he preferred the title to that of king.\n Before, she\u0027d displayed no hint of jealousy. Not even toward the princesses. Not until they\u0027d insulted her had she even displayed anger. But knowing him as she did, she thought variety was his weakness. This entire situation had to be abhorrent to her.\n The girls regarded Bride as queens would a peasant. As if she were beneath them. Had they always been so snotty? Devyn found he couldn\u0027t remember. He\u0027d slept with them, many times, but hadn\u0027t noticed anything else about them. Hadn\u0027t cared to.\n Jalyn\u0027s chin rose. \"Who do you think you are?\"\n McKell stepped forward. \"She is Bride, a vampire, found on the surface at an auction. She is mine.”\n “Actually,\" Devyn said, \"she\u0027s mine.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027ve never seen her before.\" The pronouncement came from De-Ella, as if her lack of knowledge lowered Bride\u0027s value.\n Had they always been this oblivious, as well? \"That\u0027s because she was raised on Earth.”\n “Then send her back,\" Jalyn snapped. \"She bores me.\"\n \"Well, then. Let me entertain you with a story.\" Smiling evilly, teeth completely bared, Bride ambled toward her. \"Stop me if you\u0027ve heard this one. There once was a girl who wiped the floor with two vampire princesses. They screamed and begged for mercy, but no one helped them. The end.\"\n \"Don\u0027t come any closer.\" Jalyn drummed her nails against her arms. \"If I must, I\u0027ll call for the guards.\"\n McKell bent in a formal bow. \"I\u0027m right here, Princess.\"\n \"Take her away, then.\" Clearly assuming her orders would be obeyed, Jalyn cast a sultry gaze at Devyn. \"As that\u0027s settled, it\u0027s time to see to you ...\"\n De-Ella reached out and fisted his shirt. \"Just give us five minutes, and we\u0027ll remind you what you liked most about us.\"\n \"I. Will. Not. Be. Ignored. Time to show you the story,\" Bride said, and it was the only warning she gave of her intentions. One moment she was beside Devyn, seemingly calm as could be, and the next she had her arms locked around De-Ella\u0027s waist, both women soaring through the air.\n They crashed into the wall, De-Ella\u0027s head and back taking most of the force. When she realized what was happening, Jalyn shrieked and launched into the fray. The three rolled on the floor, punching and biting at each other, clawing and cursing.\n \"Bitch,\" he thought he heard Bride growl. She raked her nails across De-Ella\u0027s cheek, and blood welled. Pride lanced through him.\n De-Ella grabbed a clump of her hair and jerked. Rage joined the pride, and he growled.\n \"You\u0027ll pay for that,\" Bride snarled before latching onto the vampire\u0027s wrist and crushing the bone. More pride.\n There was a howl of pain. \"I\u0027ll kill you! Do you hear me? I\u0027ll kill you!\" Jalyn elbowed her in the stomach.\n More rage. Scowling, he clasped onto their energy molecules, freezing all three in place. They were tangled together, Bride\u0027s eyes bright red and filled with the same intense agony he\u0027d seen the first time she\u0027d climaxed for him.\n He was moving forward, determined to break them up and ease whatever was troubling Bride. The few punches she\u0027d taken wouldn\u0027t cause that amount of suffering.\n \"No. You mustn\u0027t. She must prove her strength.\" McKell\u0027s clamped onto his shoulder, stopping him. \"If she doesn\u0027t, if you step in, they will be considered the victors, and to the victor goes the spoils. All that is hers will then belong to them. Including you.\"\n As if. \"I\u0027d think that would make you happy,\" he said, shaking off the warrior\u0027s hold. \"I won\u0027t deny it. But Bride\u0027s life here would be miserable.\"\n \"She won\u0027t be living here,\" Devyn said. \"If you\u0027d like me to communicate that through interpretive dance so that you better understand, I\u0027m happy to perform.\"\n One second Devyn\u0027s left eye felt fine, normal, and the next it felt tender and swollen again, as it had when he\u0027d first entered the cave. As many times as he\u0027d been hit in his long life, he knew the sensation. And he\u0027d definitely been hit. He\u0027d never seen McKell move, which meant the bastard had stopped time.\n Damn if he didn\u0027t admire the vampire for it.\n \"You don\u0027t know she\u0027ll return to the surface,\" McKell said as if nothing had happened. \"You\u0027ve seen me, right? Trust me, where I go, she\u0027ll go.\"\n \"How does she stand your ego?\" McKell waved a hand through the air. \"Never mind. Don\u0027t answer. Just think of it this way. If the king gives her to you, and she ever wishes to return here, which she might, she will be teased and insulted and tormented. They will never leave her alone. Nor will their friends. She will be fair game to the males, considered weak and in need of a master.\"\n For any other lover, he would have laughed, even enjoyed the show. Catfights were fun, after all. \"It\u0027s two against one.\" More than that, Bride was hurting.\n \"Yes, and next time it will be five against one. Unless she proves herself.\"\n Devyn drew in a breath, then slowly released it—and the women. The fight resumed as if it had never paused.\n Bride swung her leg around and kicked De-Ella in the stomach. He wanted to cheer. She spun and elbowed Jalyn in the jaw. He did cheer. The older De-Ella possessed a speed Bride hadn\u0027t yet achieved and raced behind her, grabbing her around the middle and sinking her teeth into Bride\u0027s exposed neck.\n When Bride reached behind to grab the vampire by the head and perhaps snap her neck, Jalyn seized her wrist and twisted, perhaps breaking the bone.\n \"That will teach you to challenge your betters, little Bride.\"\n Devyn stepped forward again, then managed to catch himself. His hands were clenched into fists. His teeth were digging into his bottom lip. She\u0027s a fast healer, he reminded himself. She\u0027ll be fine.\n Bride wrenched free of Jalyn\u0027s hold, and even though her hand was damaged, she grabbed De-Ella\u0027s head as she\u0027d first intended and jerked. The vampiress soared over her shoulder and slapped into the ground. Bride stomped on the woman\u0027s trachea exactly as he\u0027d once wanted to do to Nolan even while dragging a shocked Jalyn to her and viciously sinking her fangs into the woman\u0027s neck.\n She sucked so savagely, the vampire could not even struggle because struggling only anchored Bride deeper. Soon Jalyn went limp, and her eyes closed. Bride dropped her, spit out the blood, and lowered that gleaming red gaze to De-Ella.\n Pride, much greater than before, swam through him. She\u0027d done it. Two against one, and she\u0027d kicked major ass. Oh, yes. That\u0027s my girl.\n \"Do we understand each other?\" Bride said, rubbing her chest. Y-yes.\n She stomped to Devyn, and halted only when she was a whisper away. The hand at her chest never ceased moving. \"Thorns,\" she said. She sounded more animal than human—or rather, vampire— just then. Looked it, too. Blood was smeared over her lips and chin, and her fangs were longer and sharper than ever.\n \"Thorns?\" He didn\u0027t wait for her response, but cupped her jaw, fingers spanning up and tracing over her cheeks, thumbs wiping the blood from her mouth. \"Explain, and I\u0027ll kiss it better.\"\n \"Actually, you won\u0027t touch her again without my permission,\" a hard voice rang out from behind him.\n A hush fell over the room. Devyn and Bride turned. Paling, McKell bowed submissively. De-Ella lumbered to her knees. Jalyn was still out cold.\n The king had arrived.\n CHAPTER 25\n Bride struggled to regain control of herself. There was a haze of red behind her eyes, a throb in her neck and knuckles, and a burn in her lungs. The thorns surrounding the source of her buried abilities were savagely scraping against her, harder than ever before.\n Despite the newcomer\u0027s demand for Devyn to keep his hands to himself, he reached out and twined their fingers, his thumb caressing her wrist in comfort. That helped enough that she was able to subdue most of her pain.\n \"Majesty,\" he said respectfully, inclining his head in greeting.\n The vampire king, she realized. There was something she needed to do ... something important... She drew a deep breath in through her nose, held it... held it... released it slowly. Her muscles eased their vise grip on her bones, and her gaze cleared. What did she need to— blank her mind! Yes, that was it. Blank her mind because the king, Manus, was a thought reader.\n \"Majesty,\" she said, curtsying as she\u0027d seen women do in movies. Her legs shook.\n When she straightened, the ruler of her people came into view. He was tall, taller even than Devyn, with pale, shaggy hair and eyes of black velvet. They would have been devil eyes, if not for the thick frame of lashes around them.\n His lips were stained red, as if he\u0027d just eaten. His features were perfect, carved from marble and as pale as his hair. He possessed muscle stacked upon muscle, but that was not what gave him such an air of strength. It was the magic humming from him, so vibrant she could actually hear it singing in her ears. And her ears liked it. Wanted more.\n \"Your defiance is showing, Targon,\" the king said to Devyn. There was a slight lifting of his lips. That was it, the only hint of his amusement. His features were too hard to reveal anything else.\n \"And it\u0027s as lovely as the rest of me, I\u0027m sure.\" Devyn, at least, sounded fully amused. \"You haven\u0027t changed, I see.\"\n Blank mind, blank mind.\n \"Rise.\" Manus waved his fingers to punctuate his command. \"All of you. Then someone must explain why I was not greeted properly.\"\n McKell straightened. He, too, seemed carved from marble just then. \"We had every intention of seeking you out, Highness. We were simply waiting until the line thinned.\"\n Manus wore a cape of black-and-gold velvet, the material thick and plush. It billowed at his feet, though he didn\u0027t move. \"There\u0027s been much thought about the Targon\u0027s arrival, but only a few have wondered at the girl with him, a stranger to our land. I didn\u0027t believe it, of course, because everyone in this room knows visitors are forbidden.\" There at the end, his voice had hardened menacingly. \"Who and what is she?\"\n \"She is vampire,\" McKell said. \"Meant to remain here.\"\n You little shit, Bride thought, wanting to slam her fist into his teeth so that he\u0027d have trouble talking\n for a while.\n \"Is she?\" Those obsidian eyes slid to the puncture wounds on the female Bride had bitten. \"Raised on Earth, found by the Targon. You both want her, and you both expect me to declare who she will stay with. You both expect to be chosen.\"\n Silence.\n Thick, heavy.\n Bride gulped, no longer quite so confident of her ability to tell this man where he could roast. Mind blank.\n \"Step forward, Bride of the surface.\"\n Though she despised him for what he\u0027d done to her mother—mind blank, damn it—she only hesitated for a second. Devyn released her reluctantly, giving her a final squeeze. In this underground, the king\u0027s word was law. He decided who lived and who died. Who stayed and who was allowed to leave.\n When she was a few inches away, she stopped. He was just so big. His body consumed her personal space. Mind blank. But even as she commanded it, thoughts swam through her head. If he tried to hurt Devyn, she would tear this place apart.\n He frowned down at her.\n Oh, God. He heard. Beads of sweat broke out over her brow, and she stepped backward before she could stop herself. I wish he couldn\u0027t hear my thoughts. And she didn\u0027t care what the consequences were of that.\n \"Be still,\" he commanded. He reached out and placed his fingertips at her temples. His skin was dry and cool. His frown intensified. \"Have you no opinions?\"\n \"Excuse me?\"\n \"Your mind is blocked to me.\"\n It was? Her wish had worked? Don\u0027t smile. \"Huh. Interesting,\" was all she said, as deadpan as possible, but she thought, How\u0027s this for an opinion? Your people and their eating habits suck. And I don\u0027t mean that literally.\n No reaction.\n She couldn\u0027t help herself. She smiled.\n Sparks of white suddenly dotted the darkness of his eyes. \"Your smile is lovely. However, I do not like your ability to keep me out.\" His head tilted to the side. \"But generous as I am, I will allow it.\"\n Wow. Finally she\u0027d met someone more assured of his own goodness and superiority than Devyn. \"Thanks.\"\n \"Guards,\" he called, and Bride stiffened. He didn\u0027t look away from her as a flood of armed vampires\n marched into the room. They lined the wall, awaiting their king\u0027s command. \"Before we get to know one another, your companions must be dealt with.\"\n \"Whatever you\u0027re planning, I won\u0027t allow it,\" she said, violently shaking her head, backing away.\n \"Silence.\" The king\u0027s mouth, hard already with disapproval, hardened further. \"Targon, you purchased two vampires from an auction and gave them to your friends at AIR. That is a crime against my people. A crime you knew better than to commit.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-39.html","bookId":1769,"book":{"id":1769,"title":"Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4) \n SHE HAS A BODY MADE FOR TEMPTATION...AND A KISS TO DIE FOR. \n The war between otherworlders and humans changed Earth beyond recognition.
