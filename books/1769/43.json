The bright blue beam faded. A moment later— \"Devyn.\" Her voice. He spun, his heart drumming erratically. \"Bride.\" He strode to her, everything else forgotten. He pushed Kyrin out of the way—the otherworlder fell back weakly—and crouched in front of her. He cupped her face, not at all surprised to see that he was trembling. \"Love, can you hear me? Are you all right?\" She blinked a few times, emerald irises clearing. \"Yes and yes,\" she said, sounding fatigued. \"Hungry, though.\" \"Everyone out,\" Devyn commanded without looking away from her. There was a stream of laughter behind him, clothes rustling as Dallas helped Kyrin stand. \"I love you, Bride,\" Macy called. \"Love you,\" Bride managed. Footsteps echoed, and then the door was shutting. Devyn gathered Bride in his arms and settled atop the mattress. \"Tell me everything, and then you can eat. What\u0027s been happening? How are you?\" He couldn\u0027t stop touching her. The soft skin he so loved, the silky hair his fingers always itched to sift through. \"After Kyrin made it past the thorns, we had to go through the powers one by one and decide which ones could roam free and which ones needed to be suppressed. I never thought we\u0027d finish. Some of them didn\u0027t want to be contained again and fought us. But guess what? I can now scramble my energy so you can\u0027t control me, as well as absorb stun without any adverse effects. Well, one stream of stun, not the continuous stream you paralyzed me with, you bastard.\" \"You\u0027re welcome. So what you\u0027re telling me is that there\u0027ll be no forced stripping?\" Could she hear the pout in his voice? \"She kissed the base of his neck. \"Not from me, but I bet I can make you do it. I\u0027m still pretty much all-powerful.\" He grinned, his first in days. \"Is that a reminder that you saved my ass in the underground?\" \"Maybe.\" Her warm breath tickled him. It was a sensation he\u0027d been dreaming of for a week. \"Mmm, you smell good. You always smell good.\" \"God, I missed you.\" \"I missed you, too.\" He rolled, pinning her beneath him. He meant to yell at her a bit, but had to kiss those lush lips first. The moment he did, he had to taste that sweet flavor. On and on the kiss continued, hot and needy and a promise of love he freely gave. Finally, he forced himself to pull back. \"If you ever again try to leave me ...\" He let his anger and hurt shine through. Shaking as violently as he was, she reached up and caressed his jaw. \"Hate to break it to you, but you\u0027re stuck with me. I\u0027m now stronger than you are. And just so you know, you won\u0027t even be able to force me out with a crane.\" He barked out a laugh. \"As if I would try. I\u0027m a man who deserves the best, and I\u0027ve finally found her.\" Her gaze fell to his neck, and she licked her lips. \"Now, what about this hunger of mine ...\" He didn\u0027t hesitate. He guided her to his vein. Immediately her teeth sank inside, and she moaned. He groaned in bliss. \"Oh, have I missed this.\" She sucked, and he rubbed himself against her, unable to stop himself. He\u0027d imagined having her back in his bed so many times, it was like a dream come true to actually have her there. \"For me, too,\" she said after she finished drinking. \"What is?\" \"It\u0027s like a dream come true.\" He blinked. \"I didn\u0027t say that aloud.\" \"Oh.\" She shifted uncomfortably as she nibbled on her lower, bloodstained lip. \"Secret\u0027s out, I guess. I kept the mind-reading thing. Kyrin tried to bury it, but I nearly scratched his mental eyes out.\" \"I\u0027m glad,\" Devyn said, laughing. She peered up at him, unsure. \"Really?\" He nodded. \"That way, you\u0027ll know what position I want you in without having to be told.\" As he spoke, he planted little kisses along her face. \"Pervert.\" \"Fine, fine. You\u0027ll also know how much I love you even when I\u0027m flirting outrageously with someone else.\" \"Slut.\" Grinning, she tangled her hands in his hair. \"I love you so much.\" \"And I love you. Now and always.\" He licked at her lips. \"We are going to have some amazing children. The best this world has ever seen.\" Her entire body stilled as she stared up at him. \"Children? You want to have kids with me?” “Oh, yes. You and no other. You\u0027re the only one worthy of my seed,\" he teased. \"Oh, my dear, sweet Bradley. I\u0027m going to make you very happy you said that,\" she said, rolling him over and straddling his waist. She was true to her word.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-43.html","bookId":1769,"book":{"id":1769,"title":"Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4)","description":"Storyline: Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4) SHE HAS A BODY MADE FOR TEMPTATION...AND A KISS TO DIE FOR.
