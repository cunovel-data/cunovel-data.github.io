But guilt joined ranks with his anger, and he squeezed his eyes shut, hoping to tamp down both emotions. If I\u0027d allowed the vision inside earlier, would I have been able to stop this? Was Devyn now hurt? Dead? They\u0027d known there was a chance Bride would erupt when she learned that Devyn had \"captured\" Macy, aka Aleaha, but neither of them had taken it seriously. Devyn could lock the woman in place. Besides that, females simply didn\u0027t attack Devyn. Not with malicious intentions, anyway.\\n\\n Maybe Bride had learned how to defend herself against Devyn\u0027s ability, as Nolan had done. In fact, Nolan could have told her what to do. Snarling, Dallas punched the wall, leaving a hole.\\n\\n Devyn\u0027s alive. He\u0027s on his way here. You know that. The panic gradually receded, and Dallas watched inside his mind as Devyn reached out and tucked a lock of Bride\u0027s dark hair behind her ear. An action of affection. Bride nibbled on her bottom lip, her fangs sharp, and peered down at the ground, shy but intrigued. Dallas relaxed a little more. Whatever had happened between the pair had been consensual and perhaps nonviolent, despite the blood. But damn, he was going to have to talk to his friend about his bed partners.\\n\\n Bride turned on her heel and marched away, disappearing into the shadows. Devyn was smiling that wicked, satisfied smile of his.\\n\\n Not such a bad vision, after all, Dallas thought, shoulders slouching in relief. That image faded, making way for the second. Once again colors began to take shape. Moments later, the pier came into view. A metal bridge that stretched over what little water remained, inching its way to shore.\\n\\n There was Devyn, a knife in his heart, his body prone, motionless, his eyes closed, blood all around him. Bride stood off to the side, a group of men flanking her. They were holding her in place as she cried and screamed and fought for freedom.\\n\\n Every muscle in Dallas\u0027s body tightened. Devyn planned to tell Bride to meet him at the pier, but he didn\u0027t plan to actually go. Had his friend changed his mind?\\n\\n Dallas shifted his attention, scanning the entire area. There was no sign of himself, Breean, or Macy. He then focused on the men holding Bride, memorizing their features, their clothing.\\n\\n \"—on, my man.\" A warm hand patted his cheek. \"Wake up for me. Your visions have never taken this long before. What\u0027s going on? You know I hate mysteries.\"\\n\\n Everything winked out of focus, and Dallas almost roared. He clawed at his mind, at the dark box, desperate to learn everything he could, but nothing reappeared in the first and the second was now empty.\\n\\n Okay. Fine. Dallas would write down everything he remembered about the vision, and he would reason it out, share the details with the players involved, and then do whatever was necessary to stop it from happening. He wouldn\u0027t make the same mistake as last time. He wouldn\u0027t assume he knew what had brought about the events or who had caused Devyn\u0027s... death.\\n\\n No. No! Devyn would not die. There was no longer any question about whether to embrace or suppress. Dallas would embrace and ensure his friend lived.\\n\\n \"Wake up for your sweet Devyn.\" Another pat, this one harder. \"That\u0027s a good boy.\"\\n\\n Slowly Dallas blinked open his eyes. He was still panting, still sweating, but was no longer in pain. Devyn loomed over him, concern darkening his usually bright eyes. Just as Dallas had seen him in his first vision, Devyn was covered in blood. It stained his skin, his clothes.\\n\\n \"Okay?\" he managed to work past his spasming throat.\\n\\n \"Me?\" The otherworlder looked surprised by the question. \"Why—oh. The blood. No worries. It\u0027s not mine.\"\\n\\n Thank God. \"Vampire decide ... to eat... in front... of you?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing like that. I\u0027ll explain in a bit. You want to tell me what\u0027s going on with you?\" Not yet. \"How\u0027d you ... get in?\"\\n\\n \"I peeked over your shoulder last time you disabled your alarm. Memorized your code.\" Smiling despite the pain, Dallas rubbed his temples. \"You are such a good friend.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" Devyn helped him to a sitting position and remained crouched in front of him. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind, but I sent your woman on her way. She was shaking you, screaming for you to wake up, and pissing off your neighbors.\"\\n\\n Dallas propped his elbows on his knees, hating the way he trembled. \"Not safe for her to walk the streets alone.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why I called her a cab. And be prepared. If you see her again, you\u0027re going to get an earful. First she passed out when she saw me, then she woke up and threatened to call the police. I told her if she was going to hang around you, she\u0027d have to get used to seeing me because fainting at the sight of my beauty was going to piss you off, and I\u0027d rather cut out her eyes than piss you off.\"\\n\\n \"And that didn\u0027t go over well? Women. I\u0027m sure the coat of blood you\u0027re wearing had nothing to do with her reaction to you.\"\\n\\n Devyn searched his face. \"Your color is returning. Good. You\u0027re going to be fine.”\\n\\n “I\u0027m the psychic, but yeah, you\u0027re right.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to shower. Make us a pot of coffee—real, not artificial, if you\u0027ve got any of the stuff I bought you left over—and we\u0027ll talk when I\u0027m done.\" He didn\u0027t wait for Dallas\u0027s response but stood and strode toward the back of the apartment.\\n\\n Dallas, too, stood but he stumbled his way into the kitchen. He had just enough beans for a full pot. As he prepared it, he anchored his phone to his ear and dialed Mia.\\n\\n She answered on the second ring. \"Dal, you shit, this better be good. It\u0027s my night off.”\\n\\n “Yeah, it is. Good, I mean. I need a sketch artist as soon as possible.”\\n\\n “Why?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll share the details the moment I understand them.\"\\n\\n \"Uh, you tell me or you don\u0027t get a damn thing.\" Jack, their former boss, would have agreed with Dallas right away. Female bosses sucked. \"Think of this as an early birthday present, then. It\u0027s all I want.\"\\n\\n A sigh crackled over the line. \"Bastard. Your place or the station?\"\\n\\n Okay. Maybe female bosses weren\u0027t so bad. Jack would have told him to fuck himself for his present. \"My place.\"\\n\\n \"Two hours?”\\n\\n “Perfect.\"\\n\\n \"Fuck you, I\u0027m going back to sleep. Call me when you\u0027re ready to talk, and that better be no later than forty-eight hours, or I swear to God I\u0027ll kick your ass into next week just like Jack always threatened.\" Click.\\n\\n Dallas was grinning as he slid his cell over the counter, the scent of caffeine thickening the air, frivolous and decadent. He gathered two cups, the last remaining scoop of real sugar, and a can of dried milk. Devyn liked his caffeine sweet, but refused to drink anything with synthetics. Dallas would have called him a girl, but Devyn would have viewed that as a compliment.\\n\\n The smell of dry enzyme soap drifted to him, alerting him to Devyn\u0027s arrival. He turned. And sure enough, there was his friend, bent over and resting his elbows on the counter. The blood was gone, his hair perfectly combed. He wore Dallas\u0027s favorite \"Size Dental Appliances Here\" with an arrow pointing down T-shirt and a pair of his jeans.\\n\\n \"You gave me that shirt as a gift. Taking it back?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll return it. It\u0027s just the only thing you own that\u0027s made from real cotton. My skin deserves the best.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re such a snob.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d say I\u0027m smart for treating myself with luxuries, but whatever. Now, tell me what the hell was going on with you when I walked in.\"\\n\\n The coffee machine beeped, and Dallas filled the two mugs. He dropped a spoon in Devyn\u0027s so that the otherworlder could stir his own shit and handed it to him. \"I had a vision and was trying to sort through it. Must have gone a little too deep into my brain.\"\\n\\n \"I guessed that. What I want to know is what you saw. And why have Mia send a sketch artist over?\"\\n\\n \"You have ears like Mishka, man.\" The girl could hear a feather land on a mattress from two miles away.\\n\\n Devyn shrugged. \"Start talking.\"\\n\\n Dallas leaned back against the counter and sipped at the hot java for strength. First, he told his friend about the blood.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s nothing,\" Devyn said. \"I killed a human.\"\\n\\n Dallas blinked at him, at the casual way he admitted to murder. \"Wait. I couldn\u0027t possibly have heard you right. Did you just say you killed a human?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. He was a slaver. Tried to abduct Bride to sell her on the black market.”\\n\\n “And you killed him? Dude, you\u0027ve bought women on the black market.\"\\n\\n Again Devyn shrugged, but there was something in his eyes. Something Dallas had never seen before and couldn\u0027t place. \"There are others out there who know about her, but no matter how much I tortured him, he wouldn\u0027t give me their names. Probably because he knew he was going to die either way. Either that, or there weren\u0027t actually any others. Only time will tell.\"\\n\\n There wasn\u0027t an ounce of remorse in his friend\u0027s tone. No one could kill as ruthlessly or as uncaringly as Devyn. The man saw each of his actions as a necessary duty and never looked back, never regretted. Maybe that was why they got along so well. Dallas had enough regrets for both of them.\\n\\n \"Mia know?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet, but she will. I left the guy\u0027s head on Main.\"\\n\\n Dallas\u0027s eyes widened. Devyn had made the announcement while lifting and studying one of Dallas\u0027s small black computer maps. \"Tell me. Do you polish your titanium balls every night before bed, or do you just hang them in your trophy case?\"\\n\\n \"Polish,\" Devyn said deadpan, tossing the map aside. \"Damn. Mia\u0027s gonna go ballistic. You know that, don\u0027t you? Still the otherworlder remained unconcerned. \"I\u0027ll handle her.\"\\n\\n \"Not without me.\" No way was Dallas going to let Devyn go down for this. Because Devyn was an otherworlder, he didn\u0027t have the same rights as Dallas. If necessary, he\u0027d take total blame. Most they\u0027d do to him was slap his wrists. They could send Devyn away, kick him out of AIR, or even execute him. \"Anyone see you?\"\\n\\n \"Probably.\"\\n\\n What would it take to actually ruffle Devyn\u0027s feathers? Something catastrophic, surely. \"So why the hell\u0027d you leave his head outside for anyone to find?\"\\n\\n \"It was a message.\"\\n\\n He arched a brow. \"And that would be that Devyn of the Targons is a psycho?\" Devyn laughed. \"No. Mess with Bride and suffer.\"\\n\\n Now Dallas\u0027s brow furrowed in question. \"You into her or something? I mean, really into her?\" Devyn loved and left his women like they were no more important than a fast-food meal. To him, they weren\u0027t.\\n\\n Devyn\u0027s gaze sharpened, a play of emotions flashing through those amber depths. Readable emotions. Lust, tenderness, anger, disbelief. \"For now. She\u0027ll lose her appeal soon enough.\"\\n\\n Oh, oh, oh. What was this? Finally, a reaction. And over a woman. Inconceivable. Odd as it was, though, it wouldn\u0027t last; it couldn\u0027t. Still. This just wasn\u0027t Devyn\u0027s style.\\n\\n A frightening thought suddenly occurred to Dallas. When Bride lost her appeal and Devyn dropped her— Devyn always dropped the women, they never dropped him—would she wallow in fury?\\n\\n Entertain thoughts of revenge? Would she pay someone to hurt him? Stab him at the pier?\\n\\n He drained the rest of his coffee. \"Well, like I was saying about the visions ... I had two. And the second one involved you, the female, and a knife through your heart.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 10\\n\\n As the first rays of sunlight glowed from the sky, Bride entered her apartment, quietly closed the door, and pressed the lock pad, engaging the ID scan on the outside. She rested her forehead against the cool metal, her eyes closed, breathing deeply, in and out, in and out. Her stomach was twisted with renewed hunger, her mouth dry. She was shaky, tired.\\n\\n In the background, the TV hummed softly. The air was as clean and sterile as always, the purifiers she used running at top speed. The only scent she detected was ... apples?\\n\\n Her brow wrinkled, and she drew in another breath, holding it while she studied the aroma. Sure enough. Apples. She hadn\u0027t smelled them in more than sixty or so years, but she\u0027d never forgotten their sweetness.\\n\\n Once, she\u0027d been casing a neighborhood, trying to decide which house to rob. The war had not yet erupted, and the world had been a different place. Trees had been lush, real fruit available for purchase on every street corner. And cheap, God, had they been cheap. The pennies she\u0027d stolen from her foster parents had been enough to buy all the apples she\u0027d wanted. Not to eat but to smell. She\u0027d even dabbed the juice on herself, her own version of perfume.\\n\\n Would have been a perfect memory if not for the taint of the foster parents. Ugh. Demons in human skin, that\u0027s what they\u0027d been. The authorities had plucked her off the streets, placed her in the system. She\u0027d looked about thirteen years old—no telling how old she\u0027d really been, though—with a \"sun allergy,\" so no one had wanted to adopt her. She\u0027d bounced from home to home, her refusal to eat earning her doctor visits and sometimes force-feedings that caused her to puke her guts out.\\n\\n Only once had she been caught drinking blood, and it had earned her the beating of a lifetime. If she\u0027d been human, she would have died from it. The couple responsible had called her \"unholy,” “evil,\" and \"perverted.\"\\n\\n She was taken away from them and moved to her final foster home. Sadly, the one before had not been the worst. The husband, her \"caregiver,\" had snuck into her room one night, holding her down, intending to rape her.\\n\\n Before he\u0027d even removed her PJs, out had come her fangs, and she\u0027d drained him dry. It was the first killing she\u0027d ever enjoyed. No telling how many other innocent children he\u0027d hurt. But much as she\u0027d been proud, happy with her actions, she\u0027d also been scared. She would be deemed a murderer, probably sent to jail. So she\u0027d run, and once again the streets had become her home. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-16.html","bookId":1769,"book":{"id":1769,"title":"Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4)","description":"Storyline: Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4) \\n SHE HAS A BODY MADE FOR TEMPTATION...AND A KISS TO DIE FOR. \\n The war between otherworlders and humans changed Earth beyond recognition.
