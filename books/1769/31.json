{"id":73517,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"McKell popped his jaw, his attention never veering from her. \"My name is Victor. McKell is merely my classification.\" \"Warrior classification,\" she said, and he nodded. \"So I\u0027m a warrior, as well? Or do vampire females take the classification of who they\u0027re promised to?\" He opened his mouth to respond, but a voice from the podium stopped him. \"Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.\" The overhead halogens flashed on and off. \"We\u0027re about to begin, and as you can plainly see, we have a wonderful selection for you tonight.\" \"We\u0027ll talk,\" the vampire told her. \"After.\" And with that, he gave them his back as if they were no threat at all and settled in his seat. Devyn ushered Bride to the section of seats behind and across from the warrior. He eased into one of the plush cushion-covered folding chairs. When she attempted to do the same, he shook his head and pointed to the ground. The twig- and dirt-laden ground? Seriously? \"Sit,\" he barked, clearly at the end of his patience. Eyes wide, she plopped herself at his feet. Never had she heard so much anger in his tone. Not even when he\u0027d first proclaimed them married. He seethed with the emotion, his muscles stiff and his face like granite. Because McKell thought he had a claim on her? Did he? She rubbed the tattoo on her wrist. Or rather, brand. She\u0027d been given to him at birth, he\u0027d said. That must mean marriages between vampires were arranged. In all her imaginings, she\u0027d never thought her people would be so archaic. But clearly they were. What would her life have been like if she\u0027d married McKell? She wouldn\u0027t have met Devyn, that was for sure. Or maybe she would have. He\u0027d once gone underground. Would they have met then? Would they have circled each other, have been challenged by the other, and ultimately have given in to the attraction? At this point, she couldn\u0027t imagine not wanting him. Her desire for him was now such a big part of her life. \"This sucks,\" Dallas said as he settled beside Devyn, drawing her from her musings. \"What if the auctioneer doesn\u0027t know who\u0027s vampire? I never got a chance to study the prisoners.\" \"Just follow McKell\u0027s lead.\" Though Devyn spoke quietly, she could still detect the fury in his voice. He wasn\u0027t calming down. She wanted to soothe him, but didn\u0027t know how. Then, a few seconds later, the auction began, and she forgot all about him. One at a time, the people were paraded along the parapet, their robes parted, their bodies displayed for all to see. Disgust welled inside her. It was cruel. Some of the people cried and blushed, even looked away from the crowd. Some of the people stared straight ahead, as if they\u0027d already endured far worse horrors, and being studied and critiqued was nothing. To block the horror from her mind, she peered over at McKell. She didn\u0027t have a good view of him, but enough of one to make out his strong profile. A slightly longer than normal nose, unlined skin, dark hair a bit shaggy. Not a bad piece of meat. Ick. Now I\u0027m thinking like the buyers. Devyn\u0027s palm flattened on her head, fingers digging into her scalp. \"See something you like, love?\" Love. He\u0027d never called her that before, and that he did now had her trembling. Did he mean it? Did she want him to mean it? She tore her attention away from McKell and looked up at Devyn to study him. His gaze was on the parapet. His jaw was clenched, his eyes narrowed, but oh, the fire inside them was fierce. \"Now I do,\" she said softly, hating herself because it was the truth. His grip loosened, and he even stroked her hair. His expression smoothed out. Calm at last. \"We have much to discuss, you and I,\" he said. Much to discuss. As in their parting? As in why he hadn\u0027t touched her in a week, but the moment someone else expressed an interest in her, he talked about her as if she were his favorite possession? Anger suddenly danced through her. Was that what it took to keep Devyn\u0027s notice? Have someone else desire her? Well, she wasn\u0027t playing that game. He either wanted her or he didn\u0027t. Just then, McKell\u0027s voice reverberated through the building. Surprised, she twisted yet again. His hand was in the air, which meant he\u0027d just made a bid. Her attention swung to the stage. A tall, leanly muscled male with pale skin and snow-white hair stood proudly. He was one of those who refused to look away from the crowd. But he didn\u0027t simply endure. He hissed and bared his teeth, yet she didn\u0027t notice fangs. \"—stronger, faster, deadlier,\" the auctioneer was saying. \"Word of warning, though. You\u0027ll have to be careful with him. He\u0027s a biter.\" A wave of laughter rose from the crowd, sickening her further. The bidding speed increased, hands flying in the air. \"Look at these eyes,\" the announcer said. \"Dark blue. Like sapphires. Come on, ladies. You love jewelry, you know you do. Get tired of the man, and you can wear his eyes.\" \"How are they holding him if he\u0027s so strong?\" Bride whispered. \"Drugs, perhaps,\" Devyn said. \"Not allowing him to drink, maybe.\" McKell placed another bid. \"Now,\" Devyn said to Dallas. Dallas shouted out such an astronomical sum that the crowd instantly quieted. The auctioneer gasped. McKell twisted in his seat, glaring. \"Sold,\" the auctioneer proclaimed with a grin. And on and on the auction continued. McKell never bid again, but he did stiffen when a young female was brought forward. Her skin was not as pale as the vampire male\u0027s had been, but her hair was just as white, and Devyn instructed Dallas to bid. Once again, he won. Finally, it was over, the last otherworlder purchased. Devyn and Dallas, along with the rest of the crowd, pushed to their feet. Neither of them helped Bride stand. Her eyes were dry, even though she wanted to cry for all those who had been sold and what they would soon endure. She committed the faces around her to memory, thinking to track them down and free their \"slaves\" the moment she was able. Or better yet, she\u0027d use Devyn\u0027s money and pay someone else to do it right away. \"Warrior that he is, he\u0027ll have his men try to take them,\" Devyn said quietly to Dallas. \"Be prepared.\" \"And where will you be?\" the agent asked behind his hand. \"Evading him and keeping Bride safe. Tell Mia I\u0027ve met my end of the bargain.\" The bargain. Bride\u0027s blood was no longer to be tested, in exchange for as many vampires as Devyn could get his hands on. Two, as it turned out. The sickness in her stomach churned. No way would she let that male and female be used as pincushions, their bodies drained. She\u0027d offer herself back to AIR on a platter if necessary. She, at least, wasn\u0027t traumatized. The two men looked at each other, nodded in silent understanding, and then Dallas was moving to the stage to collect his winnings. \"You\u0027re coming with me, and I don\u0027t want to hear a single protest,\" Devyn said stiffly. He didn\u0027t glance down at her, nor did he jump into motion. What was he waiting for? \"Yeah, well, you\u0027re going to hear a lot of protests.\" She kept her body angled away from him, as if she were talking to herself. McKell was still in his seat, facing the parapet. \"The auction\u0027s over, you have your booty, so I\u0027m done being a slave. The power is going to your head. And not the one I want! Or wanted. I don\u0027t anymore. And just so you know, we can\u0027t let these people be taken to God knows where, God knows what done to them.\" \"We can, and we will. If I know AIR, and I do, they\u0027ll free those they can before the new owners ever set foot into their cars.\" She relaxed at that. \"What about the vampires?” “You were treated well. They will be, as well.\" \"How can they be treated well if they\u0027re locked up for the rest of their lives?\" A muscle ticked below his eye. He had no answer. \"AIR can have them for a week, then I want you to reclaim our property,\" she said, determined. \"What\u0027s yours is mine, remember?\" \"We\u0027ll talk to Mia about it.\" We will. Not I will. Because of that, she was able to nod in agreement. \"Now for the other subject I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t want to discuss. I want to question McKell about my people.\" As though McKell had heard her, he stood. Faced them. \"You\u0027re right. I don\u0027t.\" Finally Devyn jolted into motion. He gripped her hand and dragged her toward the exit, winding around people and chairs. \"You can question our property, as you called them, at AIR. McKell will just try and take you underground.\" Her heart drummed in her chest. \"But what if I want to see the underground?\" Did she have family there? \"You could be sentenced to death for living topside. Remember? Therefore, you can\u0027t go. You can\u0027t risk it.\" He paused for a moment, flicked her a glance over his shoulder. \"If that wasn\u0027t a factor, though, you would still want to go?\" \"Yes.\" Bride felt a pair of intense eyes boring into her back and knew who watched her. Still, she couldn\u0027t help herself. She twisted. Sure enough, McKell was watching her through narrowed lids. His hands were clenched into fists, his posture straight as a board. He wasn\u0027t following, though. He stood in place. \"I\u0027ve dreamed of having a family my entire life.\" \"Even though that family gave you to a man at birth? It\u0027s not tradition, you know. That isn\u0027t something that happens to all newborn females.\" \"Oh.\" Why had they done that to her, then, if it wasn\u0027t tradition as she\u0027d first assumed? Payment? They just hadn\u0027t wanted her? She fought a surge of depression. \"Yes,\" she said softly. The only way to gain the answers she sought was to ask those who had been involved. \"I\u0027d still want to go.\" As they stepped outside, the musty, perfumed air inside the building gave way to the cooler, cleaner air of the night. She breathed deeply. There was a hint of car exhaust, but that was better than a gaggle of bodies that reeked of food. \"Since I can\u0027t go underground, I want to talk to McKell.\" He hadn\u0027t seemed to mind her questions. Had seemed eager to answer them. \"Have I told you lately how irritating you are?\" Devyn increased his speed. Her feet tripped over themselves as she struggled to keep up. \"I\u0027m a joy to be around, and you know it. Now where are you taking me?\" He\u0027d already bypassed his own vehicle. \"Whatever I end up doing, and I\u0027m changing my mind about every three seconds, I couldn\u0027t do it in there,\" he said. \"They\u0027d erected some sort of energy scrambler so that I couldn\u0027t control any of the bodies.\" Note to self: buy an energy scrambler. Not that Devyn had controlled her movements since making her strip in that apartment, the bastard. He tangled his free hand through his hair, clearly agitated. He stomped from the parking lot entirely, heading toward a fenced-off forest area. Government property. \"Uh, Devyn.\" \"Not now.\" \"Then when? When we\u0027re arrested?\" The more they walked, the quieter the night became and the sweeter the air. Trees. Mmm. Again she inhaled deeply, savoring their scent. Finally Devyn stopped; they had reached the fence. He spun, gripping her shoulders, gaze frantic, a little wild now. \"Are you with me, Bride?\" She blinked up at him in confusion. \"I\u0027m standing here, aren\u0027t I?\" He shook her. \"Do you like McKell more than you like me?\" Did she—what? Her mind could barely process his words or what he wanted from her. \"Who said I liked either of you?\" \"I\u0027ll get you the answers about your family,\" he said, his intensity unwavering. \"I\u0027ll even get you inside the underground if you want to visit, and I\u0027ll keep you safe. But you are not to engage the vampire. Do you understand? He\u0027s determined to keep you for himself.\" And his point? \"People don\u0027t always get what they want, now do they?\" Another shake. \"Bride. Be serious. Tell me you\u0027re not attracted to McKell.\" Her brain rattled in her skull, and a shocking thought seemed to pop free. \"Devyn, are you ... jealous?\" This was more than simply wanting her because another man found her attractive. Devyn was too desperate. Desperate in a way she\u0027d never seen him. \"No, of course not.\" His hands fell from her, but his scowl remained. \"I just don\u0027t want you giving yourself to anyone else while you\u0027re married to me. For now, you\u0027re mine. I\u0027ll kill anyone who touches you,\" he added. Uh, hello jealousy. She wanted to grin but didn\u0027t. He didn\u0027t deserve to know how happy he\u0027d just made her. \"Since you\u0027re so jealous, why have you ignored me this past week? Why have you slept in a different bed?\" \"I\u0027m not jealous, I said.\" Eyes narrowing, Devyn backed her up until a boulder stopped him. \"I stayed away because I wanted you to know that I respect you.\" \"Give me a minute to work past your jealousy and figure out what you just said.\" She gasped as the coldness of the rock met her shoulders and thighs. \"Nope. Still don\u0027t understand. What does denying me have to do with respecting me?\" He pushed his nose into hers. \"Do you know what it\u0027s like to be locked away? To be alone, left in the dark, forgotten, the silence deafening?\" Silent, she shook her head. \"I do. As a boy I was locked away for exhibiting even the smallest hint of desire. I was told sex was dirty and shaming. For a long time, I even believed it. I got over it, but with you, I felt those old thoughts resurfacing, and I was so afraid of—\" Overcome, emotions bubbling over, Bride threw her arms around his neck and slammed her lips into his. He hadn\u0027t left her alone because he\u0027d stopped wanting her. He\u0027d left her alone because he\u0027d been afraid of shaming her. She\u0027d show him the error of that, she thought, thrusting her tongue into his mouth. At first, he didn\u0027t respond. Then he moaned. He smashed his weight into her body, and his tongue plundered deep, taking, giving, leaving her weak with pleasure.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-31.html","bookId":1769,"book":{"id":1769,"title":"Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4)","description":"Storyline: Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4) SHE HAS A BODY MADE FOR TEMPTATION...AND A KISS TO DIE FOR.
