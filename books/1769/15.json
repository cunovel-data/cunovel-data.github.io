Sweat had beaded over Tom\u0027s face. His lips were pulled into a frightened frown, and lines of tension branched from his eyes. \"Denied the delectable morsel that is my Bride. I understand your pain, human. I, too, let her get away once. Now, what I don\u0027t understand is shooting at the woman days later.\" Every word was harsher, harder.\n His Bride?\n \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re messing with, man,\" Tom said on a trembling breath as he tried to collect himself. \"Just let me go, and we\u0027ll forget this ever happened.\"\n \"Oh, then please enlighten me as to what I\u0027m messing with.\"\n Tom\u0027s dark eyes skidded to Bride before returning to Devyn, the biggest threat. \"She\u0027s a vampire. She\u0027ll suck you dry if given the chance. I know how to deal with them. I can protect you from her.\"\n So. He knew she was a vampire. How many others knew? Was there already a mob after her, determined to stake her or bum her alive? \"Why do you think I\u0027m ... vampire?\" She couldn\u0027t keep the fear from her voice. She\u0027d gone to such pains to hide what she was.\n Tom laughed cruelly. \"Few weeks ago you were seen drinking from a bum in an alleyway just like this. You were followed, information gathered. When I questioned your ex-boyfriend, I learned some interesting things about your nightly habits. And guess what? I\u0027m not the only one who knows about you. My friends plan to sell you to the highest bidder.\" He turned to Devyn. \"Let me go, and you can have half the profits. You don\u0027t want a bloodsucker as a lover, trust me. We\u0027ll find you something else. Something sweet and pliable.\"\n Something, he\u0027d said, as if the women weren\u0027t living beings. She realized he\u0027d never truly desired her, had just sought her capture and the profit that would have accompanied it. Bastard.\n \"No, thanks. I\u0027d rather send your friends a message.\" Devyn slid a long, sharp knife from his side, the silver winking in the moonlight.\n He\u0027d turned down money and a slave. For her. Sweetest gesture ever. That didn\u0027t mean she\u0027d sleep with him, but wow. She might maybe kinda sorta didn\u0027t despise him now. Like you did before.\n \"Wh-what kind of message?\" Tom asked, gaze glued to the weapon. If he\u0027d had control of his body, he would have trembled, shrank back. Maybe pissed his pants. There was an unholy gleam to Devyn, as if he relished what was about to happen. As if he could already smell the blood and gore and found it heady. \"How are you holding me so still? Let me go. Please, just let me go, or you\u0027ll regret it.\"\n \"I can promise you, I\u0027ll do no such thing. I never regret.\" Devyn seemed to have forgotten Bride was even there, his full attention focused on his prey. And that\u0027s exactly what Tom was just then. Prey. Part of her suddenly wanted to leave Devyn to his torturing and race home. To safety. The other part of her wanted to find out who Tom\u0027s friends were, so that Devyn could destroy them, too.\n In the end, she stayed. And she watched. Just in case Devyn needed assistance. Tom did a lot of crying, a lot of begging, but Devyn never relented. Merciless, cruel, he took his time, slicing, taunting, inflicting maximum pain without actually killing the human. At one point, Bride asked him if she should act as lookout and keep others from approaching, but he told her he\u0027d taken care of that. Probably with his body-control ability.\n Tom spilled blood—lots and lots of blood—and Bride\u0027s mouth watered for all of that beautiful crimson nectar. Her fangs were sharpened, cutting her gums. Still she smelled the spice, but it no longer mattered in any way. She was starving, and the human was a banquet. But she resisted. Barely. Now was not the time to gorge. Once this was done, she needed to be on her feet, not writhing and vomiting. She needed to go home and decide what to do now that others knew about her.\n When Devyn cut off one of Tom\u0027s fingers, blood sprayed her directly in the face, dripping ... oh, yes, dripping ... begging her to taste, and she almost crumbled. Somehow, she managed to keep her tongue inside her mouth. A single taste would whip her into a frenzy; since her body always absorbed those first sips, it thought it could handle more and so it would demand more. She would drink and gulp and lap every drop from the sidewalk, unable to help herself.\n Again she thought that she should leave, but Tom also began spilling lots and lots of secrets, so she remained in place, listening. Horrified. He and his friends had been slavers for years. They hadn\u0027t just planned to abduct her. They\u0027d planned to abduct many women. Selling them for sex, torture, or whatever the winning bidder wanted. The rarer the species, the higher the price.\n Apparently, vampires were now the pick du jour.\n Names, though, Tom refused to give, and in the end Devyn carved him up piece by piece before cutting off his head and depositing it on the nearest street corner for someone to find and news stations to shout about. Tom\u0027s friends would see what had happened to him and know he\u0027d been caught.\n By then, it was an hour before sunset. Bride was covered in blood spatter, scared to her soul about slavers knowing who she was and where she lived, rubbing her chest to stave off the pain, and in awe of Devyn. Not once had he tired or hesitated. The very man who had probably charmed thousands of women out of their panties had been brutal, savage. Emotionless.\n He turned to her, eyes as bright an amber as always but filled with uncertainty. \"You\u0027re frightened.”\n “Yes.\" No reason to deny it.\n He looked away from her. \"Of me?\"\n She should be. Anyone who could take a life like that, hurt someone like that, was not a good enemy to have, and she\u0027d challenged him several times already. She\u0027d even vowed to make his life miserable. Yet right here, right now, she felt safer with him than anyone else in the world.\n \"No, not you. I\u0027m afraid of the men who hunt me.\"\n There was a beat of surprise before a slow grin spread over his face and he once again met her gaze. What a morbidly beautiful sight he was, Bride thought. He waved a dismissive hand. \"When they see the news, they\u0027ll know. Mess with Bride McKells and die.\"\n \"That, or they\u0027ll come for revenge.\" A shudder rocked her.\n His head tilted to the side in thought. \"You could always room with me.\" The moment he spoke, his lips pursed, as if he wanted to snatch back the words.\n \"No, thanks. I\u0027ve been protecting myself for years. I\u0027ll be fine.\" Most likely she\u0027d have to move again, change her name again. Damn. She didn\u0027t want to do either. She liked her home.\n He popped his jaw, an action completely at odds with the tender way he then brushed her hair behind her ear. \"They won\u0027t come for you, not for days yet. When they find out about Tom, they\u0027ll meet and talk about what to do. You have time to think, to plan, so rest easy tonight. Or rather, today. We\u0027ll figure out how to handle them once Nolan and Aleaha are taken care of.\" He glanced up at the sky. \"Much as I\u0027m enjoying our time together, you had better go. I doubt you can tolerate the sun for long.\"\n \"You\u0027re right. It blisters my skin.\" It was a weakness she shouldn\u0027t have admitted to, but after everything he\u0027d done for her, her defenses were down and the truth had simply slipped out.\n \"Until tomorrow, then.\"\n She backed away, intending to leave as he\u0027d suggested, but stopped herself before she\u0027d even taken four steps. \"Devyn?\"\n \"Don\u0027t tell me. You want to kiss me good-bye.\" He sighed, waved her over. \"Fine. I\u0027ll jump on that grenade. Get over here.\"\n She rolled her eyes. \"Why did you help me?\" she asked. She had to know.\n For a moment, she doubted he would answer. Then he shrugged. \"You have Nolan. And you owe me three make-out sessions. I wasn\u0027t about to let you die and renege.\"\n Whatever she\u0027d hoped to hear, that wasn\u0027t it. \"Uh, I owe you kisses. Not make-out sessions.\" She paused, nibbled on her bottom lip. \"Will you get in trouble? For killing a human, I mean?\" As an otherworlder, he had very few rights. Unfair, but the way of the world all the same.\n His lips twitched. \"Worried for me, sweetheart? Well, don\u0027t be. If I\u0027m punished, I\u0027ll make you fuck me all better.\"\n She spun around, giving him her back before he saw her smile. Fuck him all better, indeed. Incorrigible womanizer. \"See you later, Devyn,\" she said, and strode away from him.\n CHAPTER 9\n Dallas Gutierrez clutched a garbage bag as he pushed through the mess in his living room, bending down and picking up trash. Cleaning. Ugh. It was something he hadn\u0027t done in months. After his near-death experience, he\u0027d just stopped caring about the state of his domicile. Why waste precious time doing something he hated? But Devyn liked clean and neat, and Devyn would arrive any moment. He knew it, sensed it.\n They hadn\u0027t talked since yesterday morning, when Dallas had taken Macy and Breean to a motel to \"search\" for Bride. They\u0027d even made plans to meet for coffee at eight a.m. today, a few hours away. But Devyn was on his way even now. Lately, Dallas knew all kinds of trivial things. They seeped into his head, not visions but whispers of coming truths.\n He hated it. He didn\u0027t want to know things before they happened. Little or big. Last few months, a lot of his friends had stopped calling, stopped hanging out with him. They were afraid of him and what he could now do. Predict the future. Move at speeds the human eye couldn\u0027t see. Compel people to obey him with only a single voiced command.\n The speed, he actually enjoyed. He\u0027d secretly used it on the job once or twice and was a better agent because of it. Only problem was, he couldn\u0027t have one ability without the others. Okay, two problems. His control of each ability was sketchy. Maybe because he fought them so fervently. But he couldn\u0027t help himself. When he welcomed his visions with open arms, he saw loved ones die. When he forced people to do things they didn\u0027t want to do, the guilt ate at him for days. Therefore, he tried not to use either.\n Finally, though, he\u0027d caved and tried to force Nolan to stay in that alley, unmoving, compliant, because, unlike Devyn\u0027s, Dallas\u0027s ability wasn\u0027t a manipulation of energy but an exertion of will. And look what that had gotten him. Failure. That particular power had remained dormant, Nolan had continued to move, and Dallas had had a vision of himself, as he was now, in bed with a woman he hadn\u0027t seen in months. How?\n Kyrin had offered to teach and train him, but Dallas couldn\u0027t bring himself to agree. The more time he spent with the Arcadian, the more he was reminded that his will was not his own. That he was really just a slave to another.\n What am I going to do? He needed to decide, one way or another: welcome all of his abilities completely or suppress them, which Kyrin had said he could do if he ignored all three abilities long enough. Either way, he needed to decide now.\n For the past few hours, another vision had been knocking on his brain, demanding entrance. He\u0027d been fighting it, but fighting brought crack-your-skull-against-the-wall headaches. So ... embrace all? Or suppress?\n Knowing the future brought both triumph and failure. Last time he\u0027d almost killed his friend Jaxon trying to prevent a vision from coming true. But if he knew what was going to happen, he could possibly save a life one day.\n Damn it. There were good arguments for both decisions.\n He needed to do something. Well, you can\u0027t call an old girlfriend to come over and distract you. Because of what he\u0027d seen in that alley, he\u0027d already done that.\n After griping him out for not calling in forever, she\u0027d come over and they\u0027d played naughty AIRagent and dirty otherworlder. He\u0027d acted like the dirty otherworlder, and she\u0027d had no idea how perfectly the role fit him now. Every day he lost a little more of his humanity.\n Now she was asleep in his bedroom. He should have sent her home after the sex, but he hadn\u0027t wanted to be alone. How pathetic.\n As he continued to clean, Dallas began sweating, panting, unable to catch his breath. His ribs soon felt as if they were comprised of glass and were cutting into his chest cavity. His temples ached unbearably. Just suck it up. He swiped up an empty sandwich wrapper, an image of—no. No! He shoved the image away with a mental hand, not booting it out of his brain but keeping it locked inside a box. He hadn\u0027t made a decision yet.\n The action caused a sharp, agonizing pain to tear through him, and he dropped to his knees. He gritted his teeth, his jaw clenching so tightly that the joints threatened to snap out of place. Nausea rolled through his stomach. Just suppress already. Knowing the future changes the future, and not always for the better.\n What if someone I love is about to be hurt?\n He lumbered to his feet as the vision tried to claw its way free. He shook his head violently, and still another pain slashed through him, doubling him over. A moan slipped from him. Too much. It was too much. If he kept fighting, undecided, he was going to have an aneurism.\n Not knowing what else to do, Dallas peeked through a crack in that box. The pain eased slightly. There were two visions, he realized, each vying for entrance. One, he\u0027d ignored for hours. The other was brand-new. No wonder the knocking had intensified.\n Don\u0027t do it. Don\u0027t let them in. Ignorance is bliss, and you won\u0027t be able to mess with the future. It\u0027s better to know. And this way, you can keep your super speed.\n The two desires warred inside him until he was shaking, almost foaming at the mouth. Every nerve ending in his body was sharpening, desperate to cut through him and escape the pain.\n Don\u0027t do it. You almost killed Jaxon, remember?\n Do it, do it, do it. You\u0027re wiser now. You won\u0027t hurt anyone. How many times do you have to be reminded that you could save more lives—\n With a roar, he wrenched open the box. The first vision flew into his mind, colors taking shape, images forming. There was Devyn, standing in an abandoned alleyway, soaked in blood. It dripped from him—draining his life? In front of him was the vampire, Bride. She, too, was covered in blood. There were smudges around her mouth, as if she\u0027d recently fed and had tried to wipe herself clean. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-15.html","bookId":1769,"book":{"id":1769,"title":"Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4) \n SHE HAS A BODY MADE FOR TEMPTATION...AND A KISS TO DIE FOR. \n The war between otherworlders and humans changed Earth beyond recognition.
