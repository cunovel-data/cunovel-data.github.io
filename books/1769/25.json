{"id":73511,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"\"What are you going to do?\" Hector asked. Letting Hector see his powers, know beyond any doubt that he was different and no longer just speculate about it, didn\u0027t sit well. Hector was one of the few people who didn\u0027t complain about working with him. Would that change? \"You\u0027ll see.\" Now that he\u0027d accepted his abilities, was letting them do what they wanted, when they wanted to do it, using them shouldn\u0027t be a problem. As he peered down at the men, he reached inside himself to the box containing his powers, no longer locked and shoved into the shadows. He clasped onto the mind control, which was twinkling like a star. The moment he touched it, its energy exploded through him and he cried out. Almost fell to his knees. It was so strong, weighing down his shoulders, shooting through his body like a boomerang, vibrating in his bones. \"Dallas?\" Hector said. Dallas held up a hand to ward him off, and they stood like that, in silence, for several minutes. Finally, things settled, and he was able to refocus. Hector was watching him with concern, though the agent didn\u0027t voice that concern. He wouldn\u0027t, either. He wouldn\u0027t want the humans to think Dallas was about to crumble. Dallas crouched in front of the guy he\u0027d cut, the only one still conscious. \"Tell me why you\u0027re here.\" The moment he spoke, the guy\u0027s eyes glazed over and he started talking, unable to stop himself. \"The vampire. We want to sell her. We already have a buyer. A man. He was looking for a female vampire with a tattoo on her wrist. We were to capture her, stun her if at all possible, and take her in uninjured. But she killed Tom, my brother, and we decided to rough her up a bit before delivering her to her new master.\" So. They were slavers, just as he\u0027d suspected. What he liked least about all he\u0027d heard was that they had a buyer ready to go. \"Tell me who wants her.\" \"I don\u0027t know his name.\" \"Who does?” “My boss.\" Dallas learned what he could about the boss and then said, \"Sleep.\" Once again the guy couldn\u0027t help but obey. He looked over at Hector, who was eyeing him with confusion and wariness, and opened his mouth to explain what had just happened, but pressed his lips together before a single word escaped. Hector would freak if Dallas forced him to do something. Accident or not. He closed his eyes. Focused. Tried to push the power back into its box, but it refused. It was free, now swirling through him in a frenzy and tickling his vocal cords. Not knowing what else to do, he whipped out his cell and typed Hector a text. Can\u0027t speak. Power. No automatic off switch. Hector\u0027s phone beeped, and the agent pulled it out with a frown. Read the text. Paused. Nodded stiffly. Lost another friend, Dallas thought, turning back to the couch. He would have gone to Nolan\u0027s cage and commanded Nolan to tell him everything he wanted to know, but the otherworlder had immunity to that power, as well. It seemed to Dallas that he—or anyone—only had to use their abilities against Nolan once for Nolan to learn how to combat them. First the voice, then Devyn\u0027s energy thing. \"It\u0027s okay, man,\" Hector said, suddenly beside him and patting his shoulder. \"Your secret is safe with me.\" He held out his hands, spreading his fingers. A white glow started at both sets of fingertips and spread up to his tattooed wrists. Brighter and brighter the glow became, until Dallas was squinting. Then the glow seemed to break apart, de-atomizing Hector\u0027s hands. Dallas swung wide eyes to Hector. Hector lowered his arms, and the glow faded. \"I\u0027m human. Stun doesn\u0027t affect me, never has, but even as a kid I could do this. I can reach into someone\u0027s body and pull out their organs, one by one. For a long time, I couldn\u0027t control it, and people died. I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m like this, but maybe more humans than we know or want to admit have strange abilities they can\u0027t explain. I mean, it\u0027s not like they\u0027d advertise them, you know. Not after the way everyone reacted to the otherworlders.\" He paused, giving Dallas time to absorb his confession. \"I\u0027m telling you because I don\u0027t want you to think I\u0027ll run and tattle. I know your secret, and now you know mine.\" Never had Dallas been more stunned. Psychic that he was, even he couldn\u0027t have predicted what had just happened. \"Backup has arrived,\" he heard Mishka say a split second before she and Eden Black pushed their way inside the apartment. He and Hector jumped apart guiltily. Both agents had their guns raised and ready for action. But they stopped and peered at the sleeping humans. \"Wow,\" Mishka said, looking to Dallas. \"You started without us.\" Behind them, the bars of Nolan\u0027s cage rattled. Dallas didn\u0027t have to turn to know Nolan had rushed to the front to get a closer view of Mishka and to listen to what was being said. \"Slavers tried to take the vampire,\" Hector said. \"Dallas was nailed in the throat and can\u0027t talk. Ask me your questions.\" He didn\u0027t have the heart to tell Hector that Mishka and Eden already knew about him. At least a little. But grateful as he was, he nodded in thanks and crossed his arms over his chest as Hector explained what happened. \"Human slavers, huh?\" Eden ran a hand through the length of her golden hair. Gold from head to toe, the woman was mouthwateringly gorgeous. \"We have no jurisdiction over them.\" Mishka bent down and slammed her fist into the closest guy\u0027s cheek. Because her arm was comprised of solid metal, his bone instantly shattered. She dusted her hands together, job well done. \"I don\u0027t care if we have jurisdiction or not. We\u0027re not giving them to the local PD.\" Everyone had taken up the Devyn, king of the Targons, way of fighting dirty, Dallas supposed. \"Oh, oh. I just had an idea. The way I hear it is the vampire is aiding AIR,\" Eden said. \"The fact that they were trying to kidnap her means they were trying to shut down an AIR investigation. That gives us all the jurisdiction we need.\" \"I love the way your mind works and could kiss you for it. Actually, I will kiss you for it.\" Mishka pressed her lips to Eden\u0027s. It was brief, without tongue, but damn, it was sexy. Dallas moaned. It was the only way to stop himself from begging for more. \"Kyrin was right behind us,\" Mishka said. \"We\u0027ll let him take out the trash.\" \"Devyn know about this?\" Eden asked. \"I heard about what he did to the last slaver that tried to get Bride.\" She shuddered, but she was grinning. \"I\u0027ve got to meet this woman. She\u0027d kept the little slut from harassing me, and I owe her, well, a kiss.\" Please let me be there for that, Dallas thought. \"I haven\u0027t told him,\" Hector replied. \"Haven\u0027t had a chance.\" \"Hey, speaking of Devyn.\" Mishka stepped on the chest of each human as she walked inside the apartment. \"You hear the latest news about him?\" Dallas shook his head, dread suddenly rushing through him. Had the vampires found Devyn? Hurt him already? Damn it. Dallas had tried to examine the vision he\u0027d had with an impartial eye, searching for all the clues before acting and making things worse or causing things to happen because of his own actions. \"Brace yourself,\" Eden said with a delighted laugh. \"Devyn told Mia he wanted Bride released from AIR custody. For good. No one was to touch her again. No more tests, even. And in return he would bring in as many vampires as he could get his hands on.\" Okay, that wasn\u0027t so bad, Dallas thought, relaxing. He didn\u0027t know how his friend was going to find the vampires, but whatever. They\u0027d do what needed to be done. Behind them, Nolan laughed. \"I guess this means Bride isn\u0027t ready for me to soothe her broken heart. Yet. Anyone wanna bet how long before she is?\" CHAPTER 16 Married? No way in hell. Bride had tried to question Devyn immediately after his silly announcement, but he\u0027d glowered at her and snapped, \"Not another word from you,\" before dragging her out of the cell. He\u0027d left her in the hallway as he spoke to his pretty boss in hushed, urgent, angry tones, received a curt nod, and then had grabbed Bride up again and ushered her to his car. Silence had reigned the entire moonlit drive to ... his home? Had to be. It was a sprawling estate on the outskirts of town, smelled of delicious pine, and boasted gold and marble fixtures, a crystal chandelier that glistened like a thousand raindrops, and a winding staircase that probably reached heaven. The furniture gleamed as though freshly polished. The onyx floor sparkled as though newly waxed. The walls were the perfect shade of pink, almost as if they were flushed, excited to see Devyn again. \"Kyrin en Arr, an Arcadian king, sold this place to me so he could move into the city with his girlfriend,\" he said, finally breaking the silence. They were in the living room, alone, surrounded by the very wealth she\u0027d dreamed of as a child. As he spoke, his cell phone rang; he ignored it. \"Do you like it?\" He wanted to engage in small talk? Now? \"Yes. But it\u0027s girly, not the kind of place I would have pictured you living.\" He stopped at the bar and poured himself a Scotch. He downed it like liquid candy. \"What can I say? It\u0027s the best.\" And he only owned the best? Not surprising, superior as he was. She plopped on the edge of a velvet chair, the material soft against her pants. What would it feel like against her skin? Don\u0027t go there. \"Okay, I can\u0027t stand it anymore. You were joking, right? We can\u0027t possibly be married. We didn\u0027t say vows or anything.\" He didn\u0027t face her, but poured himself another drink. His phone rang again, and once again he ignored it. \"Afraid we are, sweetheart,\" he said bitterly. \"Good news is, you married a very wealthy man. Isn\u0027t that what you always wanted?\" \"Yeah, but I also wanted to, I don\u0027t know, like my husband.\" Her stomach knotted. \"You can\u0027t be right about this. You just can\u0027t be.\" He kept his back to her. He was lucky she didn\u0027t stalk over there and club him in the head. \"How do you know about vampire mating customs, anyway? Have you married one before?\" There was a boom as he slammed his glass into the counter. \"First thing the king asked me when I returned two of his cousins to their underground home was whether I\u0027d given them my blood. I said yes. Second thing he asked me was whether or not I had drunk from them. When I informed him that I hadn\u0027t, he slapped me on the back and told me it was a good thing, else I would have been living the rest of my life down there with my wife.\" Or wives, since he\u0027d had two. Or would he only have been mated to the first woman he drank from? God, this was confusing. \"Well, I wasn\u0027t raised there, so I\u0027m not going to live according to their customs. Same with you. You\u0027re from another planet, for God\u0027s sake. You don\u0027t have to abide by vampire customs. Right?\" \"Actually, I do.\" Yet another call came in, its shrill ring making her jump. \"We do. If you want to stay alive, that is.\" \"First, aren\u0027t you going to answer that?\" Without looking at her, he jerked out the phone and pressed it to his ear. \"What?\" She could hear Macy\u0027s frantic voice on the other end. \"She\u0027s fine. She\u0027ll call you in a few hours.\" Click. He pressed a button and slid the device across the counter, away from him. Bride\u0027s hands curled into fists. \"I would have liked to talk to her.” “Too bad.\" What an ass. \"Second,\" she said, picking up their conversation where it had left off, \"what were you talking about? If I want to stay alive, I\u0027ll stay married to you? We aren\u0027t even married, so I can\u0027t stay married to you!\" \"Just ... be quiet, damn it.\" He plowed his fingers through his hair and rested his forehead in his upraised palms. \"I\u0027ve been thinking about this since you told me about your eating problem, and I have a theory.\" Silence. He raised and drained another glass of Scotch. The bottle was empty, so he couldn\u0027t pour another. Finally, he turned to her. His eyes were glowing, sparking with angry fire. He blamed her for this and had yet to forgive her it. Well, he could suck it! It wasn\u0027t like she\u0027d known what she\u0027d been doing. Wasn\u0027t like she\u0027d wanted to marry him. \"You have a theory?\" He gave a clipped nod. \"You were able to keep all of my blood down.\" Yes, and because of that she was thinking clearer than she had in months, was stronger than she\u0027d ever been, and despite the fact that her nerves were on edge, there was no sting or burn in her chest. She was keeping the thorns and the fire at bay. None of those wonderful things were worth this, however. \"I knew I should have resisted you,\" she grumbled. \"As if you could.\" That sounded more like the Devyn she knew, and she found herself relaxing in the chair. \"Your theory.\" \"Perhaps, as slowly as vampires age, your body had finally reached sexual maturity, and in order for a sexually mature female to sustain herself, she must drink from her mate. The blood you were ingesting before me was not from your mate, therefore your body rejected it. That means you can only take from your husband. That means you\u0027ll only ever be able to take from your husband.\" \"First, I was able to keep your blood down before we mated, as you called it. Second, as you yourself said, I was unable to keep the bulk of other blood down before I met you. And third, if you\u0027re right, that would mean we were fated to be together, and I don\u0027t believe in fate. Not like that.\" \"I\u0027m not talking about fate.\" His eyes were grave. \"I think you saw or sensed me a month ago, wanted me, and paired us in your mind. From that moment on, your body would have accepted only my blood.\" \"My God. Just when I think you can\u0027t get any more egotistical, you go and prove me wrong.\" He didn\u0027t respond, just waited.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-25.html","bookId":1769,"book":{"id":1769,"title":"Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4)","description":"Storyline: Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4) SHE HAS A BODY MADE FOR TEMPTATION...AND A KISS TO DIE FOR.
