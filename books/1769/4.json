One of the newer structures, it boasted sturdy stone and metal that could withstand fire and air strikes long enough for the people inside to evacuate safely. Not much to look at, but the people of Earth cared more about safety than aesthetics now. After they\u0027d fought the war of the species, he couldn\u0027t blame them, though he did prefer the open beauty of his own planet, Targonia.\n A planet he could return to, and often did, but one he no longer ruled. Thank God. Oh, he still had his title, still had his army, but as interplanetary travel had become more prevalent, his people had been introduced to life without a monarchy. Some had wanted to leave, travel the galaxies through interworld wormholes, while some had wanted to stay, but all had wanted to govern their own lives. So he\u0027d let them, because he\u0027d been tired, so tired, of ruling. Of being an example of all that was \"pure.\"\n Not that they\u0027d seen much of his purity those last few years.\n Now, he spent most of his time here on Earth. Helping AIR. At one time, an alien aiding the very people who policed them would have been laughable. But over the past year, the powers that be had realized the only way to control certain dominant races was with, well, certain dominant races.\n AIR liked having Devyn on their side, and they paid him very well. Though the money wasn\u0027t the reason he stuck around. He didn\u0027t need it. Being king came with certain privileges, and one of those was the cash to set himself up on whatever planet he desired in the style he was accustomed. He stuck around because of the agents he worked with. Eden, of course, was included in their numbers.\n For the first time in his vast existence, he was treated as an equal. No one lived their life based on what he said or did. No one was scandalized or humiliated by the actions of him and his \"beast.\" No one bowed to him—except the females, when he asked. Excluding Eden Black. And probably Bride. Damn it. He had to stop thinking about her. She was gone, out of reach.\n Here, he wasn\u0027t a leader, an example, or a marital prize. He was simply a man who enjoyed sex, fighting, and freedom. In that order.\n Sex. The single word elicited an image of black-as-night hair, eyes of brilliant green fire, lips stained red with blood. Every muscle in his body hardened. Did no good, trying to keep her from his mind. Why\u0027d the little firecracker have to be a vampire? Variety was the only thing that kept him sane, the only thing that kept the pain of his palace days, of being denied everything, beaten to the back of his mind.\n He stomped up the steps and entered Dallas\u0027s building, the cool night air giving way to warmth and laden with the scent of lemon cleaner. There was a lounge area complete with two chocolate colored couches and a matching chair, a coffee table and a cream-colored rug.\n Not the wisest of choices, as the pale fabric was already stained with dirt. Dirt. He shuddered. He was a clean freak and wasn\u0027t ashamed of it, even though he knew the preference stemmed from the frightened, cowed, utterly repressed boy he\u0027d once been.\n Behind the half-moon desk of monitors, the security guard nodded, clearly expecting him, allowing him to pass without a word. As he pounded up the stairs to the fifth floor—no cramped elevator for him, thank you—he enjoyed the burn in his thighs. Physical exertion of any kind was always a pleasure.\n A pretty girl, probably in her early twenties, stopped and gaped when she spotted him. She was human, with pale hair and brown eyes. A little plump, but he liked and welcomed all shapes and sizes, all colors and consenting ages. If he. hadn\u0027t sampled the race before, that is. Sadly, it was becoming harder and harder—not in the literal sense, unfortunately—to find new bed partners.\n \"Hi,\" she said, a little breathless.\n He nodded in greeting, but didn\u0027t smile, didn\u0027t flirt. No reason to lead her on. Like vampires, even lovely, colorful, tease-just-right vampires, he\u0027d already had his fill of human females. They were boring. \"Whacking off,\" as Dallas would say, was more fun.\n Her gaze bored into his back all the way down the hall. Maybe that was because he\u0027d frozen her in place. He never gave his back to a person without doing so. It was habit now, from his palace days when rebels would have done anything to cleave his head from his body. Or maybe it was because she was imagining him naked and would have raced over to flirt with him if allowed. Either way, he freed her only when he was in front of Dallas\u0027s door and she had his profile.\n Dallas Gutierrez was already standing in the opened entry, eyes narrowed, arms stretched out to block Devyn\u0027s forward progress. He was a handsome man with dark hair, dark skin, and eyes so pale a blue they were almost translucent. He wasn\u0027t quite as tall as Devyn, but was just as bulked with muscle.\n \"You\u0027re late,\" Dallas said, clearly irritated. \"The girls have already left.\"\n \"I know. I ran into Macy, Mishka, and Mia a few blocks down. And my God, that\u0027s a lot of M\u0027s.\" Apologizing would have meant he regretted where he\u0027d been and how long he\u0027d taken, and he didn\u0027t. \"Security call and let you know I was on my way up?\"\n \"No.\" There was a wealth of resentment in that one word.\n Which meant Dallas\u0027s psychic abilities were growing stronger—abilities the agent had only recently acquired and despised with every ounce of his being. The more powerful his abilities, the less breakable his bond to the alien responsible for them.\n A while back, Dallas had been shot with pyre-fire. There\u0027d been a hole in his chest, his skin and organs charred and unable to regenerate. Kyrin en Arr, an Arcadian king, had sliced his own wrist and fed Dallas his blood. That blood had saved Dallas\u0027s life, causing his body to supernaturally heal. And now, Devyn knew, as he saw a future he\u0027d never been able to see before, Dallas feared the blood inside him was turning him into an alien.\n \"Aw, you sensed me,\" Devyn said to lighten the mood. \"I\u0027m touched. I wonder if that means we\u0027re meant to be together forever.\"\n \"Fuck you.\"\n \"Proof we aren\u0027t really meant to be together, I suppose. My mate would never talk to me like that.\" Dallas bared his perfect white teeth in a scowl. \"Can you take nothing seriously?\"\n \"There\u0027ll be time enough for serious when I\u0027m dead.\" Truth. His father had ruled for two hundred years, concerned only with his reputation, bound by the opinion of others. And his father had died, not a laugh line on his face, mourning all that he\u0027d missed, all that he could have had.\n On the flip side, his mother had lived for her own happiness, no one else\u0027s, and she had died with a smile on her face, her merriment imprinted on every wall in the palace.\n At that time, Devyn had been more like his father. Joy had had no place in his life. Only duty. Only honor. He\u0027d wed the female that had been chosen for him. He\u0027d attended meetings and ceremonies, on time and dressed as benefiting his station. He\u0027d led the army but had never fought with them, his precious, stainless life too important to risk injury. He\u0027d sat on his throne and issued judgment for\n crimes, deciding who would live and who would die when he\u0027d never truly lived himself.\n He hadn\u0027t played games, and after all the punishments he\u0027d endured, he hadn\u0027t so much as looked at another woman after his marriage. Not even when said wife viewed sex as the same filthy pastime his father had. She\u0027d vomited the first and only time he\u0027d placed his ugly \"thing\" inside her. So he\u0027d kept his desires in his pants, thinking, what kind of example would I set, pledging my life to one yet lusting after another?\n When he\u0027d seen the regret in his father\u0027s eyes as the once rigid, sanctimonious man gasped his final breath, saying, \"Everything I could have done ... ,\" Devyn\u0027s entire outlook had changed. He\u0027d severed ties with his frigid queen. Divorce, it was called here. He\u0027d begun training with his men and truly leading them. Sometimes, when his dick had hardened, he\u0027d stroked it. Sometimes he\u0027d even lain with the servants—however filthy that made him.\n Occasionally shame had come gunning for him, for the things he\u0027d done to himself, for the things he\u0027d done to his lovers, but he\u0027d come to see that shame as his enemy and had fought against it with all his might.\n The more things he\u0027d done and the more women he\u0027d taken, the more he had realized the bliss of diversity. A desire to sample anything and everything had overtaken him.\n Now the shame no longer plagued him. Not even a little. He did what he wanted, when he wanted it. Bed two sisters at the same time? Why not? String a female up and whip her as she begged for orgasm? Sure. Go at it in public? Any time, any where. He would not die with a single regret.\n \"You reek of determination,\" Dallas said, cutting into his musings. \"What the hell are you thinking about?\"\n \"The past.\"\n \"That\u0027s never good.\"\n No, it wasn\u0027t. \"Gonna make me stand here all night?\" He loved human slang and used it every chance he got. Made him feel more like a man, his royal parentage a distant memory.\n \"Maybe. You\u0027d deserve it.\"\n Being late because you were enjoying a three-way wasn\u0027t a crime. It was a reason to celebrate. Perhaps Dallas the Somber needed a three-way of his own.\n \"I predicted you\u0027d be here,\" Dallas said, \"and here you are. There was nothing in my vision about you lingering. I can shut the door in your face and not change the future in some terrible way.\"\n \"Really, it doesn\u0027t get any better than predicting my presence. Your luck must be changing.\" Usually the agent\u0027s visions were bleak. Like the time he\u0027d seen a woman—a half-human, half-machine cyborg—killing their friend Jaxon. When he tried to change the outcome, it had been Dallas who\u0027d almost killed him.\n Since then, Dallas\u0027s mood had been harsh, black, the man hard as shit to please. The only silver lining was that Devyn had found something new to bed: a cyborg. Mental note: be on the lookout for a black-haired, green-eyed, half-machine woman. Even a brown-haired, hazel-eyed one would do, killing two female birds with one long, hard stone.\n \"You\u0027re doing it again,\" Dallas said on a sigh. \"Winking in and out of the conversation. Only this time you\u0027re smiling like an idiot.\"\n \"You would be, too, if you were imagining what I am.\"\n Dallas rolled his eyes. \"I don\u0027t want to know what\u0027s in your head. If I hadn\u0027t seen the dirty, downright nasty way you fight, I\u0027d think the only things you were capable of doing were having sex and thinking about sex. Now, I want to know why you were late.\"\n \"I was tied up.\" Again, truth. He\u0027d allowed his partners to anchor his wrists and ankles to the bedpost. They\u0027d liked the thought of having him at their mercy, and he\u0027d liked the girls doing all the work. Not that he\u0027d been helpless. That, he would never allow. But he\u0027d let them think he was vulnerable, and they had pleased him for it.\n The agent studied him and shook his head in exasperation. \"You might as well return to your women. Like I said, the girls have already left.\"\n They\u0027d agreed to meet today and discuss the latest threat to New Chicago. Damn if there wasn\u0027t always a threat. \"You know I never return to a woman once I\u0027ve had her. So let me in and tell me what was decided during the meeting. Meanwhile, I\u0027ll entertain you, there\u0027s no denying that, and you\u0027ll stop acting pissy. It\u0027s win-win.\"\n Another sigh. \"You don\u0027t deserve it, but fine. Come in.\" Dallas moved to the side. \"You\u0027re as vengeful as a woman, you know that?\" Devyn said as he passed him. There was a growl, and Devyn\u0027s lips twitched. So easy to provoke, his friend was.\n The apartment was as messy as always. Well, except for the time Devyn had paid two hookers to clean it. Naked. But the spotlessness hadn\u0027t lasted long. Wrappers and beer bottles were scattered throughout, along with dirty clothes and weapons. The leather couch Devyn had bought Dallas could barely be seen under the chaos.\n Grimacing, Devyn kicked his way to the kitchen and grabbed a beer. He didn\u0027t pop it open until after he\u0027d plopped into the recliner. Something hard dug into his back, but he didn\u0027t bother to move it. He\u0027d only encounter something else, he was sure.\n Dallas fell into the seat across from him and propped his ankles on the small stone table, dislodging a computer notebook and sending it to the floor with a thwack. He didn\u0027t bend down and pick it up.\n Messy as he was, Dallas usually took more care with his equipment. Something more than simple anger at Devyn\u0027s tardiness was at work here. Had to be. Devyn\u0027s gaze sharpened on him. There were lines of strain around Dallas\u0027s eyes and mouth, and his T-shirt and jeans were wrinkled, stained, and cut. He\u0027d lost a little weight. His hair hadn\u0027t been brushed in a week. Maybe a month.\n Guilt joined the beer, swimming laps inside Devyn\u0027s veins as he gulped back a few swigs. While he\u0027d spent the last two hours fucking himself stupid, his closest friend had been stressing about something. \"Tell me what\u0027s going on, and I\u0027ll fix it,\" he said. It was a vow.\n Though he only lived for his own pleasure nowadays, he couldn\u0027t walk away from a friend in need.\n He would regret it, and Devyn never did anything he would regret. Dallas scrubbed a hand down his face. \"I\u0027m not sure you can fix this.”\n “Tell me, anyway.\"\n \"Remember Nolan?\"\n \"Of course.\" Nolan was a new breed of alien called the Schön. They were beautiful and deadly, and they had come to Earth, destruction hot on their heels. Everyone they\u0027d bedded, everyone their blood had come into contact with, had soon become cannibals. Once-loving humans had morphed into flesh-eating murderers. They\u0027d also died slowly and painfully, the virus eating through them.\n AIR had managed to capture Nolan and kill several of his brethren—as well as everyone infected— and that should have been the end of it. But \"should have\" meant nothing. Now the queen of the Schön, the woman responsible for the virus and the greatest source of its power, was on her way to this planet. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-4.html","bookId":1769,"book":{"id":1769,"title":"Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Seduce the Darkness (Alien Huntress #4) \n SHE HAS A BODY MADE FOR TEMPTATION...AND A KISS TO DIE FOR. \n The war between otherworlders and humans changed Earth beyond recognition.
