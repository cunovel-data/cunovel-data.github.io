{"id":6398,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 9 Caught","content":"Ella couldn\u0027t believe how atheist, how uncouth I had become. I believed that a man should doanything that he was slick enough, or bad and bold enough, to do and that a woman was nothing butanother commodity. Every word I spoke was hip or profane. I would bet that my working vocabularywasn\u0027t two hundred words. 　　Even Shorty, whose apartment I now again shared, wasn\u0027t prepared for how I lived and thought-like apredatory animal. Sometimes I would catch him watching me. 　　At first, I slept a lot-even at night. I had slept mostly in the daytime during the preceding two years. 　　When awake, I smoked reefers. Shorty had originally introduced me to marijuana, and myconsumption of it now astounded him. 　　I didn\u0027t want to talk much, at first. When awake, I\u0027d play records continuously. The reefers gave me afeeling of contentment. I would enjoy hours of floating, day dreaming, imaginary conversations withmy New York musician friends. 　　Within two weeks, I\u0027d had more sleep than during any two months when I had been in Harlemhustling day and night. When I finally went out in the Roxbury streets, it took me only a little while tolocate a peddler of \"snow\"-cocaine. It was when I got back into that familiar snow feeling that I beganto want to talk. 　　Cocaine produces, for those who sniff its powdery white crystals, an illusion of supreme well-being,and a soaring over-confidence in both physical and mental ability. You think you could whip theheavyweight champion, and that you are smarter than anybody. There was also that feeling oftimelessness. And there were intervals of ability to recall and review things that had happened yearsback with an astonishing clarity. 　　Shorty\u0027s band played at spots around Boston three or four nights a week. After he left for work, Sophiawould come over and I\u0027d talk about my plans. She would be gone back to her husband by the timeShorty returned from work, and I\u0027d bend his ear until daybreak. 　　 Sophia\u0027s husband had gotten out of the military, and he was some sort of salesman. He was supposedto have a big deal going which soon would require his traveling a lot to the West Coast. I didn\u0027t askquestions, but Sophia often indicated they weren\u0027t doing too well. I know _I_ had nothing to do withthat. He never dreamed I existed. A white woman might blow up at her husband and scream and yelland call him every name she can think of, and say the most vicious things in an effort to hurt him, andtalk about his mother and his grandmother, too, but one thing she never will tell him herself is that sheis going with a black man. That\u0027s one automatic red murder flag to the white man, and his womanknows it. 　　Sophia always had given me money. Even when I had hundreds of dollars in my pocket, when shecame to Harlem I would take everything she had short of her train fare back to Boston. It seems thatsome women love to be exploited. When they are not exploited, they exploit the man. Anyway, it washis money that she gave me, I guess, because she never had worked. But now my demands on herincreased, and she came up with more; again, I don\u0027t know where she got it. Always, every now andthen, I had given her a hard time, just to keep her in line. Every once in a while a woman seems toneed, in fact _wants_ this, too. But now, I would feel evil and slap her around worse than ever, someof the nights when Shorty was away. She would cry, curse me, and swear that she would never beback. But I knew she wasn\u0027t even thinking about not coming back. 　　Sophia\u0027s being around was one of Shorty\u0027s greatest pleasures about my homecoming. I have said itbefore, I never in my life have seen a black man that desired white women as sincerely as Shorty did. 　　Since I had known him, he had had several. He had never been able to keep a white woman anylength of time, though, because he was too good to them, and, as I have said, any woman, white orblack, seems to get bored with that. 　　It happened that Shorty was between white women when one night Sophia brought to the house herseventeen-year-old sister. I never saw anything like the way that she and Shorty nearly jumped foreach other. For him, she wasn\u0027t only a white girl, but a _young_ white girl. For her, he wasn\u0027t only aNegro, but a Negro _musician_. In looks, she was a younger version of Sophia, who still turned heads. 　　Sometimes I\u0027d take the two girls to Negro places where Shorty played. Negroes showed thirty-twoteeth apiece as soon as they saw the white girls. They would come over to your booth, or your table;they would stand there and drool. And Shorty was no better. He\u0027d stand up there playing andwatching that young girl waiting for him, and waving at him, and winking. As soon as the set wasover, he\u0027d practically run over people getting down to our table. 　　I didn\u0027t lindy-hop any more now, I wouldn\u0027t even have thought of it now, just as I wouldn\u0027t have beencaught in a zoot suit now. All of my suits were conservative. A banker might have worn my shoes. 　　I met Laura again. We were really glad to see each other. She was a lot more like me now, a good-timegirl. We talked and laughed. She looked a lot older than she really was. She had no one man, she freelanced around. She had long since moved away from her grandmother. Laura told me she hadfinished school, but then she gave up the college idea. Laura was high whenever I saw her, now, too; we smoked some reefers together. 　　 After about a month of \"laying dead,\" as inactivity was called, I knew I had to get some kind of hustlegoing. 　　A hustler, broke, needs a stake. Some nights when Shorty was playing, I would take whatever Sophiahad been able to get for me, and I\u0027d try to run it up into something, playing stud poker at JohnHughes\u0027 gambling house. 　　When I had lived in Roxbury before, John Hughes had been a big gambler who wouldn\u0027t have spokento me. But during the war the Roxbury \"wire\" had carried a lot about things I was doing in Harlem,and now the New York name magic was on me. That was the feeling that hustlers everywhere elsehad: if you could hustle and make it in New York, they were well off to know you; it gave themprestige. Anyway, through the same flush war years, John Hughes had hustled profitably enough tobe able to open a pretty good gambling house. 　　John, one night, was playing in a game I was in. After the first two cards were dealt around the table, Ihad an ace showing. I looked beneath it at my hole card; another ace-a pair, back-to-back. 　　My ace showing made it my turn to bet. 　　But I didn\u0027t rush. I sat there and studied. 　　Finally, I knocked my knuckles on the table, passing, leaving the betting to the next man. My actionimplied that beneath my ace was some \"nothing\" card that I didn\u0027t care to risk my money on. 　　The player sitting next to me took the bait. He bet pretty heavily. And the next man raised him. 　　Possibly each of them had small pairs. Maybe they just wanted to scare me out before I drew anotherace. Finally, the bet reached John, who had a queen showing; he raised everybody. 　　Now, there was no telling what John had. John truly was a clever gambler. He could gamble as well asanybody I had gambled with in New York. 　　So the bet came back to me. It was going to cost me a lot of money to call all the raises. Some of themobviously had good cards but I knew I had every one of them beat. But again I studied, and studied; Ipretended perplexity. And finally I put in my money, calling the bets. 　　The same betting pattern went on, with each new card, right around to the last card. And when thatlast card went around, I hit another ace in sight. Three aces. And John hit another queen in sight. 　　He bet a pile. Now, everyone else studied a long time-and, one by one, all folded their hands. Except me. All I could do was put what I had left on the table. 　　If I\u0027d had the money, I could have raised five hundred dollars or more, and he\u0027d have had to call me. 　　John couldn\u0027t have gone the rest of his life wondering if I had bluffed him out of a pot that big. 　　I showed my hole card ace; John had three queens. As I hauled in the pot, something over fivehundred dollars-my first real stake in Boston-John got up from the table. He\u0027d quit. He told his houseman, \"Anytime Red comes in here and wants anything, let him have it.\" He said, \"I\u0027ve never seen ayoung man play his hole card like he played.\"John said \"young man,\" being himself about fifty, I guess, although you can never be certain about aNegro\u0027s age. He thought, as most people would have, that I was about thirty. No one in Roxburyexcept my sisters Ella and Mary suspected my real age. 　　The story of that poker game helped my on-scene reputation among the other gamblers and hustlersaround Roxbury. Another thing that happened in John\u0027s gambling house contributed: the incident thatmade it known that I carried not a gun, but some guns. 　　John had a standing rule that anyone who came into the place to gamble had to check his guns if hehad any. I always checked two guns. Then, one night, when a gambler tried to pull something slick, Idrew a third gun, from its shoulder holster. This added to the rest of my reputation the word that Iwas \"trigger-happy\" and \"crazy.\"Looking back, I think I really was at least slightly out of my mind. I viewed narcotics as most peopleregard food. I wore my guns as today I wear my neckties. Deep down, I actually believed that afterliving as fully as humanly possible, one should then die violently. I expected then, as I still expecttoday, to die at any time. But then, I think I deliberately invited death in many, sometimes insane,ways. 　　For instance, a merchant marine sailor who knew me and my reputation came into a bar carrying apackage. He motioned me to follow him downstairs into the men\u0027s room. He unwrapped a stolenmachine gun; he wanted to sell it. I said, \"How do I know it works?\" He loaded it with a cartridge clip,and told me that all I would have to do then was squeeze the trigger release. I took the gun, examinedit, and the first thing he knew I had it jammed right up in his belly. I told him I would blow him wideopen. He went backwards out of the rest room and up the stairs the way Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinsonused to dance going backwards. He knew I was crazy enough to kill him. I was insane enough not toconsider that he might just wait his chance to kill me. For perhaps a month I kept the machine gun atShorty\u0027s before I was broke and sold it. 　　When Reginald came to Roxbury visiting, he was shocked at what he\u0027d found out upon returning toHarlem. I spent some time with him. He still was the kid brother whom I still felt more \"family\"toward than I felt now even for our sister Ella. Ella still liked me. I would go to see her once in a while. 　　But Ella had never been able to reconcile herself to the way I had changed. She has since told me that she had a steady foreboding that I was on my way into big trouble. But I always had the feeling thatElla somehow admired my rebellion against the world, because she, who had so much more drive andguts than most men, often felt stymied by having been born female. 　　Had I been thinking only in terms of myself, maybe I would have chosen steady gambling as a hustle. 　　There were enough chump gamblers that hung around John Hughes\u0027 for a good gambler to make aliving off them; chumps that worked, usually. One would just have to never miss the games on theirpaydays. Besides, John Hughes had offered me a job dealing for games; I didn\u0027t want that. 　　But I had come around to thinking not only of myself. I wanted to get something going that could helpShorty, too. We had been talking; I really felt sorry for Shorty. The same old musician story. The so-called glamor of being a musician, earning just about enough money so that after he paid rent andbought his reefers and food and other routine things, he had nothing left. Plus debts. How couldShorty have anything? I\u0027d spent years in Harlem and on the road around the most popular musicians,the \"names,\" even, who really were making big money for musicians-and they had nothing. 　　For that matter, all the thousands of dollars I\u0027d handled, and _I_ had nothing. Just satisfying mycocaine habit alone cost me about twenty dollars a day. I guess another five dollars a day could havebeen added for reefers and plain tobacco cigarettes that I smoked; besides getting high on drugs, Ichain-smoked as many as four packs a day. And, if you ask me today, I\u0027ll tell you that tobacco, in all itsforms, is just as much an addiction as any narcotic. 　　When I opened the subject of a hustle with Shorty, I started by first bringing him to agree with myconcept-of which he was a living proof-that only squares kept on believing they could ever getanything by slaving. 　　And when I mentioned what I had in mind-house burglary Shorty, who always had been so relativelyconservative, really surprised me by how quickly he agreed. He didn\u0027t even know anything aboutburglarizing. 　　When I began to explain how it was done, Shorty wanted to bring in this friend of his, whom I hadmet, and liked, called Rudy. 　　Rudy\u0027s mother was Italian, his father was a Negro. He was born right there in Boston, a short, lightfellow, a pretty boy type. Rudy worked regularly for an employment agency that sent him to wait ontables at exclusive parties. He had a side deal going, a hustle that took me right back to the oldsteering days in Harlem. Once a week, Rudy went to the home of this old, rich Boston blueblood,pillar-of-society aristocrat. He paid Rudy to undress them both, then pick up the old man like a baby,lay him on his bed, then stand over him and sprinkle him all over with _talcum powder_, Rudy saidthe old man would actually reach his climax from that. 　　I told him and Shorty about some of the things I\u0027d seen. Rudy said that as far as he knew, Boston hadno organized specialty sex houses, just individual rich whites who had their private specialty desires catered to by Negroes who came to their homes camouflaged as chauffeurs, maids, waiters, or someother accepted image. Just as in New York, these were the rich, the highest society-the predominantlyold men, past the age of ability to conduct any kind of ordinary sex, always hunting for new ways tobe \"sensitive.\"Rudy, I remember, spoke of one old white man who paid a black couple to let him watch them haveintercourse on his bed. Another was so \"sensitive\" that he paid to sit on a chair outside a room where acouple was-he got his satisfaction just from imagining what was going on inside. 　　A good burglary team includes, I knew, what is called a \"finder.\" A finder is one who locates lucrativeplaces to rob. Another principal need is someone able to \"case\" these places\u0027 physical layouts-todetermine means of entry, the best getaway routes, and so forth. Rudy qualified on both counts. Beingsent to work in rich homes, he wouldn\u0027t be suspected when he sized up their loot and cased the joint,just running around looking busy with a white coat on. 　　Rudy\u0027s reaction, when he was told what we had in mind, was something, I remember, like \"Man,when do we start?\"But I wasn\u0027t rushing off half-cocked. I had learned from some of the pros, and from my ownexperience, how important it was to be careful and plan. Burglary, properly executed, though it had itsdangers, offered the maximum chances of success with the minimum risk. If you did your job so thatyou never met any of your victims, it first lessened your chances of having to attack or perhaps killsomeone. And if through some slip-up you were caught, later, by the police, there was never apositive eyewitness. 　　It is also important to select an area of burglary and stick to that. There are specific specialties amongburglars. Some work apartments only, others houses only, others stores only, or warehouses; stillothers will go after only safes or strongboxes. 　　Within the residence burglary category, there are further specialty distinctions. There are the dayburglars, the dinner-and theater-time burglars, the night burglars. I think that any city\u0027s police will tellyou that very rarely do they find one type who will work at another time. For instance Jumpsteady, inHarlem, was a nighttime apartment specialist. It would have been hard to persuade Jumpsteady towork in the daytime if a millionaire had gone out for lunch and left his front door wide open. 　　I had one very practical reason never to work in the daytime, aside from my inclinations. With myhigh visibility, I\u0027d have been sunk in the daytime. I could just hear people: \"A reddish-brown Negroover six feet tall.\" One glance would be enough. 　　 Setting up what I wanted to be the perfect operation, I thought about pulling the white girls into it for two reasons. One was that I realized we\u0027d be too limited relying only upon places where Rudy workedas a waiter. He didn\u0027t get to work in too many places; it wouldn\u0027t be very long before we ran out ofsources. And when other places had to be found and cased in the rich, white residential areas, Negroeshanging around would stick out like sore thumbs, but these white girls could get invited into the rightplaces. 　　I disliked the idea of having too many people involved, all at the same time. But with Shorty andSophia\u0027s sister so close now, and Sophia and me as though we had been together for fifty years, andRudy as eager and cool as he was, nobody would be apt to spill, everybody would be under the samerisk; we would be like a family unit. 　　I never doubted that Sophia would go along. Sophia would do anything I said. And her sister woulddo anything that Sophia said. They both went for it. Sophia\u0027s husband was away on one of his trips tothe coast when I told her and her sister. 　　Most burglars, I knew, were caught not on the job, but trying to dispose of the loot. Finding the fencewe used was a rare piece of luck. We agreed upon the plan for operations. The fence didn\u0027t work withus directly. He had a representative, an ex-con, who dealt with me, and no one else in my gang. Asidefrom his regular business, he owned around Boston several garages and small warehouses. Thearrangement was that before a job, I would alert the representative, and give him a general idea ofwhat we expected to get, and he\u0027d tell me at which garage or warehouse we should make the drop. 　　After we had made our drop, the representative would examine the stolen articles. He would removeall identifying marks from everything. Then he would call the fence, who would come and make apersonal appraisal. The next day the representative would meet me at a prearranged place and wouldmake the payment for what we had stolen-in cash. 　　One thing I remember. This fence always sent your money in crisp, brand-new bills. He was smart. 　　Somehow that had a very definite psychological effect upon all of us, after we had pulled a job,walking around with that crisp green money in our pockets. He may have had other reasons. 　　We needed a base of operations-not in Roxbury. The girls rented an apartment in Harvard Square. 　　Unlike Negroes, these white girls could go shopping for the locale and physical situation we wanted. 　　It was on the ground floor, where, moving late at night, all of us could come and go without attractingnotice. 　　 In any organization, someone must be the boss. If it\u0027s even just one person, you\u0027ve got to be the boss ofyourself. 　　At our gang\u0027s first meeting in the apartment, we discussed how we were going to work. The girlswould get into houses to case them by ringing bells and saying they were saleswomen, poll-takers,college girls making a survey, or anything else suitable. Once in the houses, they would get around as much as they could without attracting attention. Then, back, they would report what special valuablesthey had seen, and where. They would draw the layout for Shorty, Rudy, and me. We agreed that thegirls would actually burglarize only in special cases where there would be some advantage. Butgenerally the three men would go, two of us to do the job while the third kept watch in the getawaycar, with the motor running. 　　Talking to them, laying down the plans, I had deliberately sat on a bed away from them. All of asudden, I pulled out my gun, shook out all five bullets, and then let them see me put back only onebullet. I twirled the cylinder, and put the muzzle to my head. \"Now, I\u0027m going to see how much gutsall of you have,\" I said. 　　I grinned at them. All of their mouths had flapped open. I pulled the trigger-we all heard it _click_. 　　\"I\u0027m going to do it again, now.\"They begged me to stop. I could see in Shorty\u0027s and Rudy\u0027s eyes some idea of rushing me. 　　We all heard the hammer _click_ on another empty cylinder. The women were in hysterics. Rudy andShorty were begging, _\"Man. . . Red. . . cut it out, man!. . . Freeze!\"_ I pulled the trigger once more. 　　\"I\u0027m doing this, showing you I\u0027m not afraid to die,\" I told them. \"Never cross a man not afraid to die. . . 　　now, let\u0027s get to work!\"I never had one moment\u0027s trouble with any of them after that. Sophia acted awed, her sister all butcalled me \"Mr. Red.\" Shorty and Rudy were never again quite the same with me. Neither of them evermentioned it. They thought I was crazy. They were afraid of me. 　　We pulled the first job that night-the place of the old man who hired Rudy to sprinkle him withtalcum powder. A cleaner job couldn\u0027t have been asked for. Everything went like clockwork. The fencewas full of praise; he proved he meant it with his crisp, new money. The old man later told Rudy howa small army of detectives had been there-and they decided that the job had the earmarks of somegang which had been operating around Boston for about a year. 　　We quickly got it down to a science. The girls would scout and case in wealthy neighborhoods. Theburglary would be pulled; sometimes it took no more than ten minutes. Shorty and I did most of theactual burglary. Rudy generally had the getaway car. 　　If the people weren\u0027t at home, we\u0027d use a passkey on a common door lock. On a patent lock, we\u0027d usea jimmy, as it\u0027s called, or a lockpick. Or, sometimes, we would enter by windows from a fire-escape, ora roof. Gullible women often took the girls all over their houses, just to hear them exclaiming over thefinery. With the help of the girls\u0027 drawings and a finger-beam searchlight, we went straight to thethings we wanted. 　　Sometimes the victims were in their beds asleep. That may sound very daring. Actually, it was almost easy. The first thing we had to do when people were in the house was to wait, very still, and pick upthe sounds of breathing. Snorers we loved; they made it real easy. In stockinged feet, we\u0027d go rightinto the bedrooms. Moving swiftly, like shadows, we would lift clothes, watches, wallets, handbags,and jewelry boxes. 　　The Christmas season was Santa Claus for us; people had expensive presents lying all over theirhouses. And they had taken more cash than usual out of their banks. Sometimes, working earlier thanwe usually did, we even worked houses that we hadn\u0027t cased. If the shades were drawn full, and nolights were on, and there was no answer when one of the girls rang the bell, we would take the chanceand go in. 　　I can give you a very good tip if you want to keep burglars out of your house. A light on for theburglar to see is the very best single means of protection. One of the ideal things is to leave a bathroomlight on all night. The bathroom is one place where somebody could be, for any length of time, at anytime of the night, and he would be likely to hear the slightest strange sound. The burglar, knowingthis, won\u0027t try to enter. \u0027It\u0027s also the cheapest possible protection. The kilowatts are a lot cheaper thanyour valuables. 　　We became efficient. The fence sometimes relayed tips as to where we could find good loot. It was inthis way that for one period, one of our best periods, I remember, we specialized in Oriental rugs. Ihave always suspected that the fence himself sold the rugs to the people we stole them from. But,anyway, you wouldn\u0027t imagine the value of those things. I remember one small one that brought us athousand dollars. There\u0027s no telling what the fence got for it. Every burglar knew that fences robbedthe burglars worse than the burglars had robbed the victims. 　　Our only close brush with the law came once when we were making our getaway, three of us in thefront seat of the car, and the back seat loaded with stuff. Suddenly we saw a police car round thecorner, coming toward us, and it went on past us. They were just cruising. But then in the rear-viewmirror, we saw them make a U-turn, and we knew they were going to flash us to stop. They hadspotted us, in passing, as Negroes, and they knew that Negroes had no business in the area at thathour. It was a close situation. There was a lot of robbery going on; we weren\u0027t the only gang working,we knew, not by any means. But I knew that the white man is rare who will ever consider that a Negrocan outsmart him. Before their light began flashing, I told Rudy to stop. I did what I\u0027d done oncebefore-got out and flagged them, walking toward them. When they stopped, I was at their car. I askedthem, bumbling my words like a confused Negro, if they could tell me how to get to a Roxburyaddress. They told me, and we, and they, went on about our respective businesses. 　　We were going along fine. We\u0027d make a good pile and then lay low awhile, living it up. Shorty stillplayed with his band, Rudy never missed attending his sensitive old man, or the table-waiting at hisexclusive parties, and the girls maintained their routine home schedules. 　　Sometimes, I still took the girls out to places where Shorty played, and to other places, spendingmoney as though it were going out of style, the girls dressed in jewelry and furs they had selected from our hauls. No one knew our hustle, but it was clear that we were doing fine. And sometimes, thegirls would come over and we\u0027d meet them either at Shorty\u0027s in Roxbury or in our Harvard Squareplace, and just smoke reefers, and play music. It\u0027s a shame to tell on a man, but Shorty was so obsessedwith the white girl that even if the lights were out, he would pull up the shade to be able to see thatwhite flesh by the street lamp from outside. 　　 Early evenings when we were laying low between jobs, I often went to a Massachusetts Avenuenightclub called the Savoy. And Sophia would telephone me there punctually. Even when we pulledjobs, I would leave from this club, then rush back there after the job. The reason was so that if it wasever necessary, people could testify that they had seen me at just about the time the job was pulled. 　　Negroes being questioned by policemen would be very hard to pin down on any exact time. 　　Boston at this time had two Negro detectives. Ever since I had come back on the Roxbury scene, one ofthese detectives, a dark brown fellow named Turner, had never been able to stand me, and it wasmutual. He talked about what he would do to me, and I had promptly put an answer back on thewire. I knew from the way he began to act that he had heard it. Everyone knew that I carried guns. 　　And he did have sense enough to know that I wouldn\u0027t hesitate to use them-and on him, detective ornot. 　　This early evening I was in this place when at the usual time, the phone in the booth rang. It rang justas this detective Turner happened to walk in through the front door. He saw me start to get up, heknew the call was for me, but stepped inside the booth, and answered. 　　I heard him saying, looking straight at me, \"Hello, hello, hello-\" And I knew that Sophia, taking nochances with the strange voice, had hung up. 　　\"Wasn\u0027t that call for me?\" I asked Turner. 　　He said that it was. 　　I said, \"Well, why didn\u0027t you say so?\"He gave me a rude answer. I knew he wanted me to make a move, first. We both were being cagey. 　　We both knew that we wanted to kill each other. Neither wanted to say the wrong thing. Turner didn\u0027twant to say anything that, repeated, would make him sound bad. I didn\u0027t want to say anything thatcould be interpreted as a threat to a cop. 　　But I remember exactly what I said to him anyway, purposely loud enough for some people at the barto hear me. I said, \"You know, Turner-you\u0027re trying to make history. Don\u0027t you know that if you playwith me, you certainly will go down in history because you\u0027ve got to kill me?\" Turner looked at me. Then he backed down. He walked on by me. I guess he wasn\u0027t ready to makehistory. 　　I had gotten to the point where I was walking on my own coffin. 　　It\u0027s a law of the rackets that every criminal expects to get caught. He tries to stave off the inevitable foras long as he can. 　　Drugs helped me push the thought to the back of my mind. They were the center of my life. I hadgotten to the stage where every day I used enough drugs-reefers, cocaine, or both-so that I felt aboveany worries, any strains. If any worries did manage to push their way through to the surface of myconsciousness, I could float them back where they came from until tomorrow, and then until the nextday. 　　But where, always before, I had been able to smoke the reefers and to sniff the snow and rarely show itvery much, by now it was not that easy. 　　One week when we weren\u0027t working-after a big haul-I was just staying high, and I was outnightclubbing. I came into this club, and from the bartender\u0027s face when he spoke, \"Hello, Red,\" Iknew that something was wrong. But I didn\u0027t ask him anything. I\u0027ve always had this rule-never askanybody in that kind of situation; they will tell you what they want you to know. But the bartenderdidn\u0027t get a chance to tell me, if he had meant to. When I sat down on a stool and ordered a drink, Isaw them. 　　Sophia and her sister sat at a table inside, near the dance floor, with a white man. 　　I don\u0027t know how I ever made such a mistake as I next did. I could have talked to her later. I didn\u0027tknow, or care, who the white fellow was. My cocaine told me to get up. 　　It wasn\u0027t Sophia\u0027s husband. It was his closest friend. They had served in the war together. With herhusband out of town, he had asked Sophia and her sister out to dinner, and they went. But then, later,after dinner, driving around, he had suddenly suggested going over to the black ghetto. 　　Every Negro who lives in a city has seen the type a thousand times, the Northern cracker who will goto visit \"niggertown,\" to be amused at \"the coons.\"The girls, so well known in the Negro places in Roxbury, had tried to change his mind, but he hadinsisted. So they had just held their breaths coming into this club where they had been a hundredtimes. They walked in stiff-eyeing the bartenders and waiters who caught their message and acted asthough they never had seen them before. And they were sitting there with drinks before them,praying that no Negro who knew them would barge up to their table. 　　Then up I came. I know I called them \"Baby.\" They were chalky-white, he was beet-red. 　　 That same night, back at the Harvard Square place, I really got sick. It was less of a physical sicknessthan it was all of the last five years catching up. I was in my pajamas in bed, half asleep, when I heardsomeone knock. 　　I knew that something was wrong. We all had keys. No one ever knocked at the door. I rolled oft andunder the bed; I was so groggy it didn\u0027t cross my mind to grab for my gun on the dresser. 　　Under the bed, I heard the key turn, and I saw the shoes and pants cuffs walk in. I watched them walkaround. I saw them stop. Every time they stopped, I knew what the eyes were looking at. And I knew,before he did, that he was going to get down and look under the bed. He did. It was Sophia\u0027shusband\u0027s friend. His face was about two feet from mine. It looked congealed. 　　\"Ha, ha, ha, I fooled you, didn\u0027t I?\" I said. It wasn\u0027t at all funny. I got out from under the bed, still fake-laughing. He didn\u0027t run, I\u0027ll say that for him. He stood back; he watched me as though I were a snake. 　　I didn\u0027t try to hide what he already knew. The girls had some things in the closets, and around; he hadseen all of that. We even talked some. I told him the girls weren\u0027t there, and he left. What shook me themost was realizing that I had trapped myself under the bed without a gun. I really was slipping. 　　 I had put a stolen watch into a jewelry shop to replace a broken crystal. It was about two days later,when I went to pick up the watch, that things fell apart. 　　As I have said, a gun was as much a part of my dress as a necktie. I had my gun in a shoulder holster,under my coat. 　　The loser of the watch, the person from whom it had been stolen by us, I later found, had describedthe repair that it needed. It was a very expensive watch, that\u0027s why I had kept it for myself. And all ofthe jewelers in Boston had been alerted. 　　The Jew waited until I had paid him before he laid the watch on the counter. He gave his signal-andthis other fellow suddenly appeared, from the back, walking toward me. 　　One hand was in his pocket. I knew he was a cop. 　　He said, quietly, \"Step into the back.\"Just as I started back there, an innocent Negro walked into the shop. I remember later hearing that hehad just that day gotten out of the military. The detective, thinking he was with me, turned to him. 　　There I was, wearing my gun, and the detective talking to that Negro with his back to me. Today I believe that Allah was with me even then. I didn\u0027t try to shoot him. And that saved my life. 　　I remember that his name was Detective Slack. 　　I raised my arm, and motioned to him, \"Here, take my gun.\"I saw his face when he took it. He was shocked. Because of the sudden appearance of the other Negro,he had never thought about a gun. It really moved him that I hadn\u0027t tried to kill him. 　　Then, holding my gun in his hand, he signaled. And out from where they had been concealed walkedtwo other detectives. They\u0027d had me covered. One false move, I\u0027d have been dead. 　　I was going to have a long time in prison to think about that. 　　If I hadn\u0027t been arrested right when I was, I could have been dead another way. Sophia\u0027s husband\u0027sfriend had told her husband about me. And the husband had arrived that morning, and had gone tothe apartment with a gun, looking for me. He was at the apartment just about when they took me tothe precinct. 　　The detectives grilled me. They didn\u0027t beat me. They didn\u0027t even put a finger on me. And I knew itwas because I hadn\u0027t tried to kill the detective. 　　They got my address from some papers they found on me. The girls soon were picked up. Shorty waspulled right off the bandstand that night. The girls also had implicated Rudy. To this day, I havealways marveled at how Rudy, somehow, got the word, and I know he must have caught the firstthing smoking out of Boston, and he got away. They never got him. 　　I have thought a thousand times, I guess, about how I so narrowly escaped death twice that day. 　　That\u0027s why I believe that everything is written. 　　The cops found the apartment loaded with evidence-fur coats, some jewelry, other small stuff-plus thetools of our trade. A jimmy, a lockpick, glass cutters, screwdrivers, pencil-beam flashlights, falsekeys. . . and my small arsenal of guns. The girls got low bail. They were still white-burglars or not. 　　Their worst crime was their involvement with Negroes. But Shorty and I had bail set at $10, 000 each,which they knew we were nowhere near able to raise. 　　The social workers worked on us. White women in league with Negroes was their main obsession. 　　The girls weren\u0027t so-called \"tramps,\" or \"trash,\" they were well-to-do upper-middle-class whites. Thatbothered the social workers and the forces of the law more than anything else. 　　How, where, when, had I met them? Did we sleep together? Nobody wanted to know anything at allabout the robberies. All they could see was that we had taken the white man\u0027s women. 　　 I just looked at the social workers: \"Now, what do you think?\"Even the court clerks and the bailiffs: \"Nice white girls . . . goddam niggers-\" It was the same evenfrom our court-appointed lawyers as we sat down, under guard, at a table, as our hearing assembled. 　　Before the judge entered, I said to one lawyer, \"We seem to be getting sentenced because of thosegirls.\" He got red from the neck up and shuffled his papers: \"You had no business with white girls!\"Later, when I had learned the full truth about the white man, I reflected many times that the averageburglary sentence for a first offender, as we all were, was about two years. But we weren\u0027t going to getthe average-not for _our_ crime. 　　 I want to say before I go on that I have never previously told anyone my sordid past in detail. I haven\u0027tdone it now to sound as though I might be proud of how bad, how evil, I was. 　　But people are always speculating-why am I as I am? To understand that of any person, his whole life,from birth, must be reviewed. All of our experiences fuse into our personality. Everything that everhappened to us is an ingredient. 　　Today, when everything that I do has an urgency, I would not spend one hour in the preparation of abook which had the ambition to perhaps titillate some readers. But I am spending many hours becausethe full story is the best way that I know to have it seen, and understood, that I had sunk to the verybottom of the American white man\u0027s society when-soon now, in prison-I found Allah and the religionof Islam and it completely transformed my life.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/164/260.html","bookId":207,"book":{"id":207,"title":"马尔科姆·利特尔自传 The Autobiography Of Malcolm X","description":"简介： The Autobiography of Malcolm X was the result of a collaboration between Malcolm X and journalist Alex Haley, who wrote the autobiography based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted with Malcolm X between 1963 and 1965.
