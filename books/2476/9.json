It might be like... waking up after the worst nightmare you can think of, and finding that the nightmare followed you into daylight. Understandi\" again, Swan nodded. She\u0027d already thought about what he was saying, because no one had ever come to get them out like her mama had said. She put on her most grown-up face and waited for him to make the next move. \"Okay,\" Josh said. \"Let\u0027s start digging.\" Twenty-nine Josh Hutchins stared, squinted and blinked. \"Light,\" he said, the walls of the tunnel pressing against his shoulders and back. \"I see light!\" Behind him, about thirty feet away in the basement, Swan called, \"How far is iti\" She was utterly filthy, and there seemed to be so much dirt up her nostrils that they might sprout gardens, too. The thought had made her giggle a few times, a sound she\u0027d never believed she\u0027d make again. \"Maybe ten or twelve feet,\" he answered, and he continued digging with his hands and pushing the dirt behind him, then pushing it further back with his feet. The pickaxe and shovel approach had been a valiant effort, but after three days of working they\u0027d realized the best tools were their hands. Now, as he squeezed his shoulders forward to grab more dirt, Josh looked at the weak red glimmer way up at the gopher hole\u0027s entrance and thought it was the most beautiful light he\u0027d ever seen. Swan entered the tunnel behind him and scooped the loose dirt up in a large can, carrying it back to the basement to empty over the slit trench. Her hands, arms, face, nostrils and knees - everything that was covered with dirt - tingled all the way down to her bones. She felt like she had a flame burning in her backbone. across the basement, the young green shoots were four inches tall. Josh\u0027s face was plastered with dirt; even his teeth were gritty with it. The soil was heavy, with a thick, gummy consistency, and he had to stop to rest. \"Joshi You all righti\" Swan asked. \"Yeah. Just need a minute to get my wind.\" His shoulders and forearms ached mercilessly, and the last time he\u0027d been so weary was after a ten-man battle royal in Chattanooga. The light seemed further away than he\u0027d first reckoned, as if the tunnel - which they\u0027d both come to love and hate - was elongating, playing a cruel trick of perception. He felt as if he\u0027d crawled into one of those Chinese tubes that lock your fingers, one stuck into each end, except his whole body was jammed tight as a monk\u0027s jockstrap. He started again, bringing a double handful of the heavy earth back and underneath him as if he were swimming through dirt. My mama raised herself a gopher, he thought, and he had to grin despite his weariness. His mouth tasted like he\u0027d been dining on mud pies. Six more inches dug away. One more foot. Was the light closer, or further awayi He pushed himself onward, thinking about how his mama used to scold him for not scrubbing behind his ears. another foot, and another. Behind him, Swan crawled in and carried the loose dirt out again and again, like clockwork. The light was getting closer now; he was sure of it. But now it wasn\u0027t so beautiful. Now it was sickly, not like sunlight at all. Diseased, Josh thought. and maybe deadly, too. But he kept going, one double handful after the next, inching slowly toward the outside world. Dirt suddenly plopped down on the back of his neck. He lay still, expecting a cave-in, but the tunnel held. For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t stop now! he told himself, and he reached out for the next handful. \"I\u0027m almost there!\" he shouted, but the earth muffled his voice. He didn\u0027t know if Swan had heard or not. \"Just a few more feet!\" But just short of the opening, which was not quite as large as Josh\u0027s fist, he had to stop and rest again. Josh lay staring longingly at the light, the hole about three feet away. He could smell the outside now, the bitter aromas of burned earth, scorched cornstalks and alkali. Rousing himself, he pushed onward. The earth was tougher near the surface, full of glazed stones and metallic lumps. The fire had burned the dirt into something resembling pavement. Still he strained upward, his shoulders throbbing, his gaze fixed on the hole of ugly light. and then he was close enough to thrust his hand through it, but before he tried he said, \"I\u0027m there, Swan! I\u0027m at the top!\" He clawed away dirt, and his hand reached the hole. But the underside of the surface around it felt like pebbled asphalt, and he couldn\u0027t get his fingers through. He balled up his fist, the flesh mottled gray and white, and pushed. Harder. Harder still. Come on, come on, he thought. Push, damn it! There was a dry, stubborn cracking sound. at first Josh thought it was his arm breaking, but he felt no pain, and he kept pushing as if trying to punch the sky. The earth cracked again. The hole began to crumble and widen. His fist started going through, and he envisioned what it might look like to someone standing on the surface: the blossoming of a zebra-blotched fist like a strange new flower through the dead earth, the fist opening and fingers stretching petal-like under the weak red light. Josh shoved his arm through almost to the elbow. Cold wind snapped at his fingertips. That movement of air exhilarated him, jarred him as if from a long somnolence. \"We\u0027re out!\" he shouted, about to sob with joy. \"Swan! We\u0027re out!\" She was behind him, crouched in the tunnel. \"Can you see anythingi\" \"I\u0027m going to put my head through,\" he told her. \"Here goes.\" He pushed upward, his shoulder following his arm, breaking the hole wider. Then his entire arm was out, and the top of his head was ready to press through. as he pushed he thought of watching his sons being born, their heads straining to enter the world. He felt as giddy and afraid as any infant could possibly be. Behind him, Swan was pushing at him, too, giving him support as he stretched to break free. The earth parted with a sound like baked clay snapping apart. With a surge of effort, Josh thrust his head through the opening and into a biting, turbulent wind. \"are you there yeti\" Swan asked. \"What can you seei\" Josh narrowed his eyes, his hand up to ward off flying grit. He saw a desolate, grayish-brown landscape, featureless except for what appeared to be the mangled remnants of the Bonneville and Darleen\u0027s Camaro. Overhead was a low sky plated with thick gray clouds. From dead horizon to dead horizon, the clouds were slowly, ponderously rotating, and here and there were quicksilver glints of harsher scarlet. Josh looked over his shoulder. about fifteen feet behind him and to his left was a large dome of dirt, mashed-down cornstalks, pieces of wood and metal from the gas pumps and cars. He realized it was the grave they\u0027d been buried in, and at the same time he knew that if the tons of cornfield dirt hadn\u0027t sealed them in they would have been burned to death. Other than that, and a few drifts of cornstalks and debris, the land was scraped clean. The wind was blowing into his face. He crawled up out of the hole and sat on his haunches, looking around at the destruction, while Swan emerged from the tunnel. The cold sliced to her bones, and her bloodshot eyes moved incredulously over what had become a desert. \"Oh,\" she whispered, but the wind stole her voice. \"Everything\u0027s... gone...\" Josh hadn\u0027t heard her. He couldn\u0027t get any sense of direction. He knew the nearest town - or what was left of it - was Salina. But which direction was east, and which westi Where was the suni Flying grit and dust obscured everything beyond twenty yards or so. Where was the highwayi \"There\u0027s nothing left,\" Josh said, mostly to himself. \"There\u0027s not a damned thing left!\" Swan saw a familiar object lying nearby. She stood up and walked with an effort against the wind to the small figure. Most of the blue fur had been burned off of it, but its plastic eyes with the little black rolling pupils were intact. Swan reached down and picked it up. The cord with its pull ring dangled from the doll\u0027s back; she yanked it and heard the Cookie Monster ask for more cookies in a slow, distorted voice. Josh rose to his feet. Well, he thought, now we\u0027re out. Now what the hell do we doi Where do we goi He shook his head in disgust. Maybe there was nowhere to go. Maybe everything, everywhere, was just like this. What was the point of leaving their basementi He looked grimly at the hole they\u0027d just crawled from, and he thought for a moment of shimmying back down there like a big gopher and spending the rest of his days licking out cans and shitting in a slit trench. Careful, he warned himself. Because that hole back to the basement - back to the grave - was suddenly too appealing. Much, much too appealing. He stepped away from the hole a few paces and tried to think coherently. His gaze slid toward the child. She was covered with tunnel dirt, her ragged clothes flapping around her. She stared into the distance, her eyes narrowed against the wind, with that dumb doll cradled in her arms. Josh looked at her for a long time. I could do it, he told himself. Sure. I could make myself do it, because it would be the right thing. Might be the right thing. Wouldn\u0027t iti If everything is like this, what\u0027s the damned point of living, righti Josh opened his hands, closed them again. I could make it quick, he thought. She\u0027d never feel a thing. and then I could just mosey over to that junk pile and find a nice piece of metal with a sharp edge and finish the job on myself, too. That would be the right thing to do. Wouldn\u0027t iti Protect the child, he thought - and a deep, terrible shame stabbed him. Some protection! he thought. But Jesus Christ, everything\u0027s gone! Everything\u0027s been blown to Hell! Swan turned her head, and her eyes sought his. She said something, but he couldn\u0027t understand her. She walked closer to him, shivering and bowed against the wind, and she shouted, \"What are we going to doi\" \"I don\u0027t know!\" he shouted back. \"It\u0027s not like this everywhere, is iti\" she asked him. \"There must be other people somewhere! There must be towns and people!\" \"Maybe. Maybe not. Damn, it\u0027s cold!\" He trembled; he\u0027d been dressed for a hot July day, and now he hardly had a shirt on. \"We can\u0027t just stand here!\" Swan said. \"We\u0027ve got to go somewhere!\" \"Right. Well, take your choice of directions, little lady. They all look the same to me.\" Swan stared at him for a few seconds more, and again Josh felt shamed. Then she turned in all directions as if trying to choose one. Suddenly her eyes filled with tears, and they stung so much she almost screamed; but she bit her lower lip, bit it until it almost bled. She had wished for a moment that her mama was at her side, to help her and tell her what to do. She needed her mama to guide her, now more than ever. It wasn\u0027t fair that her mama was gone! It wasn\u0027t kind, and it wasn\u0027t right! But that was thinking like a little girl, she decided. Her mama had gone home, to a peaceful place far from this - and Swan had to make some decisions for herself. Starting right now. Swan lifted her hand and pointed away from the source of the wind. \"That way,\" she decided. \"any particular reasoni\" \"Yes.\" She turned and gave him a look that made him feel like the stupidest clown on earth. \"Because the wind\u0027ll be at our backs. It\u0027ll push us, and walking won\u0027t be as hard.\" \"Oh,\" Josh said meekly. In the distance she\u0027d pointed out was nothing - just swirling dust and utter desolation. He couldn\u0027t see the reason in making his legs move. Swan sensed he was ready to sit down, and when he did that there was no way she could pry his giant butt up again. \"We worked hard to get out of there, didn\u0027t wei\" she shouted to him over the wind. He nodded. \"We proved we could do something if we really wanted to, didn\u0027t wei You and mei Kind of like a teami We worked hard, and we shouldn\u0027t ought to stop working hard now.\" He nodded dully. \"We\u0027ve got to try!\" Swan shouted. Josh looked down at the hole again. at least it was warm down there. at least they\u0027d had food. What was so wrong with stay - He sensed movement from the corner of his eye. The little girl, Cookie Monster doll in arms, had begun to walk off in the direction she\u0027d chosen, the wind pushing her along. \"Hey!\" Josh yelled. Swan didn\u0027t stop or slow down. \"Hey!\" She kept going. Josh took the first step after her. The wind hit him behind his knees - a clip! Fifteen yards penalty! he thought - and then caught him in the small of the back, staggering him forward. He took a second step, then a third and a fourth. and then he was following her, but the wind was so strong at his back that it seemed more like flying than walking. He caught up with her, walking a few yards off to the side, and again Josh felt a pang of shame at his weakness, because she didn\u0027t even grace him with a glance. She was walking with her chin uplifted, as if in defiance of the bleakness that faced them; Josh thought that she looked like the little queen of a realm that had been stolen from her, a tragic and determined figure. There\u0027s nothing out there, Swan thought. a deep, terrible sadness wrenched at her, and if the wind hadn\u0027t been pushing so hard she might\u0027ve crumpled to her knees. It\u0027s all gone. all gone. Two tears ran through the crusted dirt and blisters on her face. Everything can\u0027t be gone, she told herself. There have to be towns and people left somewhere! Maybe a mile ahead. Maybe two. Just through the dust and over the horizon. She kept going, step after step, and Josh Hutchins walked at her side. Behind them, the gopher popped his head out of the crater and looked in all directions. Then he made a little chattering sound and disappeared again into the safety of the earth. Thirty Two figures trudged slowly along Interstate 80, with the snow-covered Pocono Mountains of eastern Pennsylvania at their backs. The fallen snow was dirty gray, and from it protruded rough rocks like warts growing in leprous flesh. New gray snow was tumbling from the sullen, sickly green and sunless sky, and it hissed softly amid the thousands of leafless black hickories, elms and oaks. The evergreens had turned brown and were losing their needles. From horizon to horizon, as far as Sister and artie could see, there was no green vegetation, not a green vine or leaf. The wind whipped past them, blowing the ashy snow into their faces. Both of them were bundled up with layers of clothes they\u0027d been able to scavenge in the twenty-one days since they\u0027d escaped from the monster that called itself Doyle Halland. They\u0027d found a looted Sears department store on the outskirts of Paterson, New Jersey, but almost everything had been carried out of it except for some merchandise at the back, under a big sign with painted icicles that read WINTER IN JULY SaLE! SaVE THE SEaRS WaY! The racks and tables had been untouched, and they yielded up heavy herringbone overcoats, plaid mufflers, wool caps and gloves lined with rabbit fur. There was even thermal underwear and a supply of boots, which artie praised as being high-quality merchandise. Now, after more than one hundred miles, the boots were supple but their feet were bloody, wrapped in rags and newspapers after their socks had fallen apart. Both of them carried knapsacks on their backs, laden with other scavenged objects: cans of food, a can opener, a couple of sharp all-purpose knives, some kitchen matches, a flashlight and extra batteries, and the lucky find of a six-pack of Olympia beer. around her shoulder, as well, Sister supported a dark green duffel bag from the Paterson army-Navy surplus store, which had taken the place of the smaller Gucci bag and held a thermal blanket, some bottles of Perrier and a few items of packaged cold cuts found in an almost-empty grocery store. at the bottom of the duffel bag was the glass circle, placed so Sister could feel it through the canvas whenever she wanted to. a red plaid muffler and an electric green woolen cap protected Sister\u0027s face and head from the wind, and she was wrapped in a woolen coat over two sweaters. Baggy brown corduroy pants and leather gloves completed her wardrobe, and she moved slowly through the snow with the weight that pressed on her, but at least she was warm. artie, too, was burdened with a heavy coat, a blue muffler and two caps, one over the other. Only the area around their eyes was exposed to the blowing snow, the flesh raw and windburned. The gray, ugly snow swirled about them; the interstate pavement was covered to a depth of about four inches, and higher drifts grew amid the denuded forest and deep ravines on either side. Walking a few yards in front of artie, Sister lifted her hand and pointed to the right. She trudged over to four dark clumps lying in the snow, and she peered down at the frozen corpses of a man, a woman and two children. all were wearing summer clothes: short-sleeved shirts and light pants. The man and woman had died holding hands. Except the third finger of the woman\u0027s left hand had been chopped off. Her wedding ring, Sister thought. Somebody had cut the whole finger off to get it. The man\u0027s shoes were gone, and his feet were black. His sunken eyes glistened with gray ice. Sister turned away. Since crossing over into Pennsylvania, passing a big green sign that said WELCOME TO PENNSYLVaNIa, THE KEYSTONE STaTE about thirty miles and seven days ago, they had found almost three hundred frozen bodies on Interstate 80. They\u0027d sheltered for a while in a town called Stroudsburg, which had been decimated by a tornado. The houses and buildings lay scattered under the filthy snow like the broken toys of a mad giant, and there\u0027d been plenty of corpses, too. Sister and artie had found a pickup truck - the tank drained of gas - on the town\u0027s main thoroughfare and had slept in the cab. Then it was back onto the interstate again, heading west in their supple, blood-filled boots, passing more carnage, wrecked cars and overturned trailers that must have been caught in a crush of traffic fleeing westward. The going was rough. They could make, at the most, five miles a day before they had to find shelter - the remnants of a house, a barn, a wrecked car - anything to hold back the wind. In twenty-one days of traveling they\u0027d seen only three other living people; two of those were raving mad, and the third had fled wildly into the woods when he\u0027d seen them coming. Both Sister and artie had been sick for a while, had coughed and thrown up blood and suffered splitting headaches. Sister had thought she was going to die, and they\u0027d slept huddled together, each of them breathing like a bellows; but the worst of the sickness and weak, feverish dizziness had gone, and though they both sometimes still coughed uncontrollably and vomited up a little blood, their strength had returned, and they had no more headaches. They left the four corpses behind and soon came to the wreckage of an exploded airstream trailer. a scorched Cadillac had smashed into it, and a Subaru had rear-ended the Caddy. Nearby, two other vehicles had locked and burned. Further on, another group of people lay where they\u0027d frozen to death, their bodies curled around one another in a vain search for warmth. Sister passed them without pausing; the face of death was no stranger to her now, but she couldn\u0027t stand to look too closely. about fifty yards further, Sister stopped abruptly. Just ahead of her, through the tumbling snow, an animal was gnawing at one of two corpses that lay against the right-hand guardrail. The thing looked up and tensed. It was a large dog, Sister saw - maybe a wolf, come down from the mountains to feed. The beast was about the size of a German shepherd, with a long snout and a reddish-gray hide. It had chewed a leg down to the bone, and now it crouched over its prize and stared menacingly at Sister. If that bastard wants fresh meat, we\u0027re dead, she thought. She stared back at the thing, and they challenged each other for about thirty seconds. Then the animal gave a short, muttering growl and returned to its gnawing. Sister and artie gave it a wide berth, and they kept looking back until they\u0027d rounded a curve and the thing was out of sight. Sister shuddered under her freight of clothes. The beast\u0027s eyes had reminded her of Doyle Halland\u0027s. Her fear of Doyle Halland was worst when darkness fell - and there seemed to be no regularity to the coming of darkness, no twilight or sense of the sun going away. The darkness might fall after two or three hours of gloom, or it might hold off for what seemed like twenty-four hours - but when it did fall, it was absolute. In the dark, every noise was enough to make Sister sit up and listen, her heart pounding and cold sweat popping up on her face. She had something the Doyle Halland-thing wanted, something he didn\u0027t understand - as she certainly did not - but that he\u0027d vowed to follow her to get. and what would he do with the glass ring if he got iti Smash it to piecesi Probably so. She kept looking over her shoulder as she walked, fearful of seeing a dark figure coming up behind her, its face malformed, with jagged teeth showing in a sharklike grin. \"I\u0027ll find you,\" he\u0027d promised. \"I\u0027ll find you, bitch.\" The day before, they\u0027d sheltered in a broken-down barn and had made a small fire in the hay. Sister had taken the glass ring from her duffel bag. She\u0027d thought of her future-predicting glass eight-ball, and she\u0027d mentally asked: What\u0027s ahead for usi Of course, there was no little white polyhedron surfacing with all-purpose answers. But the colors of the jewels and their pulsing, steady rhythm had soothed her; she\u0027d felt herself drifting, entranced by the glow of the ring, and then it seemed as if all her attention, all her being, was drawn deeper and deeper into the glass, deeper and deeper, as if into the very heart of fire... and then she\u0027d gone dreamwalking again, across that barren landscape where the dome of dirt was, and the Cookie Monster doll lay waiting for a lost child. But this time it was different; this time, she\u0027d been dreamwalking toward the dome - with the sensation of her feet not quite touching the earth - when she suddenly stopped and listened. She thought she\u0027d heard something over the noise of the wind - a muffled sound that might have been a human voice. She listened, strained to hear it again, but could not. and then she saw a small hole in the baked ground, almost at her feet. as she watched, she imagined that she saw the hole begin to widen, and the earth crack and strain around it. In the next moment... yes, yes, the earth was cracking, and the hole was getting larger, as if something was burrowing underneath it. She stared, both fearful and fascinated, as the sides of the hole crumbled, and she thought, I am not alone. From the hole came a human hand. It was splotched with gray and white - a large hand, the hand of a giant - and the thick fingers had clawed upward like those of a dead man digging himself out of a grave. The sight had startled her so much that she\u0027d jerked backward from the widening hole. She was afraid to see what kind of monster was emerging, and as she ran across the empty plain she\u0027d wished frantically, Take me back, please, I want to go back where I was... and she was sitting before the small fire in the broken-down barn. artie was looking at her quizzically, the raw flesh around his eyes like the Lone Ranger\u0027s mask. She\u0027d told him what she\u0027d seen, and he asked her what she thought it meant. Of course, she couldn\u0027t say; of course, it was probably just something plucked from her mind, perhaps a response to seeing all the corpses on the highway. Sister had put the glass ring back in her duffel bag, but the image of that hand stretching upward from the earth was burned into her brain. She could not shake it. Now, as she trudged through the snow, she touched the ring\u0027s outline in the canvas bag. Just knowing it was there reassured her, and right now that was all the magic she needed. Her knees locked. another wolf or wild dog or whatever it was stood in the road before her, about fifteen feet away. This one was skinny, with raw red sores on its hide. Its eyes bored into hers, and the lips slowly pulled away from the fangs in a snarl. Oh, shit! was her first reaction. This one looker hungrier and more desperate than the other. and behind it in the gray snow were two or three more, loping to the right and left. She looked over her shoulder, past artie. Two more wolf shapes were behind them, half hidden by the snow but near enough that Sister could see their outlines. Her second reaction was, Our butts are hambur - Something leapt from the left - a blur of motion - and slammed into artie\u0027s side. He yelled in pain as he fell, and the beast - which Sister thought might have been the reddish-gray animal they\u0027d seen feasting on a corpse - grabbed part of artie\u0027s knapsack between its teeth and violently shook its head back and forth, trying to rip the pack off. Sister reached down to grasp artie\u0027s outstretched hand, but the beast dragged artie about ten feet through the snow before it let go and darted off just to the edge of visibility. It continued to circle and lick its chops. She heard a guttural growl and turned just as the skinny animal with the red sores leapt for her. It struck her shoulder and knocked her sprawling, the jaws snapping shut inches from her face with a noise like a bear trap cracking together. She smelled rotted meat on its breath, and then the animal had the right sleeve of her coat and was tearing at it. another beast feinted in from the left, and a third darted boldly forward and grabbed her right foot, trying to drag her. She thrashed and yelled; the skinny one spooked and ran, but the other one pulled her on her side through the snow. She grasped the duffel bag in both arms and kicked with her left boot, hitting the beast three times in the skull before it yelped and released her. Behind her, artie was attacked by two at once, from opposite sides. One caught his wrist, the teeth almost meeting flesh through his heavy coat and sweater, the second snapping at his left shoulder and worrying him with a frenzied surge of strength. \"Get off! Get off!\" he was screaming as they strained at each other to pull him in different directions. Sister tried to stand. She slipped in the snow, fell heavily again. Panic hit her like a punch to the gut. She saw artie being dragged by an animal that held his wrist, and she realized the beasts were trying to separate them, much like they might separate a herd of deer or cattle. as she was struggling up one of the things lunged in and grabbed her ankle, dragging her another few yards from artie. Now he was just a struggling form, surrounded by the shapes of the circling animals in the swirling gray murk. \"Get away, you bastard!\" she shouted. The animal jerked her so hard she thought her leg had popped from its socket. With a scream of rage, Sister swung the duffel bag at it, clipping its snout, and the thing turned tail. But a second later another one was straddling her, its fangs snapping for her throat; she threw her arm up, and the jaws clamped onto it with brutal force. The wolf-dog started shredding the cloth of her coat. She swung her left fist at it, caught it in the ribs and heard it grunt, but it kept tearing through the coat, now reaching the first layer of sweater. Sister knew this sonofabitch wasn\u0027t stopping until he tasted meat. She hit it again and tried to wrench free, but now something had her ankle again and was pulling her in another direction. She had the crazy mental image of saltwater taffy being stretched until it snapped. She heard a sharp crack! and thought that this time her leg had broken. But the beast that was worrying her shoulder yelped and jumped, running madly off through the snow. There was a second crack! followed closely by a third. The wolf-dog that had her ankle shuddered and shrieked, and Sister saw blood spewing from a hole in its side. The animal let her go and began to spin in a circle, snapping at its tail. a fourth shot rang out - Sister realized the beast had been pierced by a bullet - and she heard an agonized howling over where artie Wisco lay. Then the others were fleeing, slipping and sliding and crashing into one another in their haste to escape. They were gone from sight within five seconds. The wounded animal fell on its side a few feet away from Sister, its legs kicking frantically. She sat up, stunned and dumbfounded, and saw artie struggling to rise, too. His feet went out from under him, and he flopped down again. a figure wearing a dark green ski mask, a beat-up brown leather jacket and blue jeans glided past Sister. He had on snowshoes laced around battered boots, and slung around his neck was a cord that pierced the necks of three empty plastic jugs, knotted at the ends to keep them from sliding off. On his back was a dark green hiker\u0027s pack, a bit smaller than the ones Sister and artie carried. He stood over Sister. \"You okayi\" His voice sounded like steel wool scrubbing a cast-iron skillet. \"Yeah, I think so.\" She had bruises on bruises, but nothing was broken. He planted the rifle he was carrying butt first in the snow, then unwrapped the cord that held the plastic jugs from around his shoulder. He set these down, too, near the still-kicking animal. His pack was shrugged off, and then he unzipped it with gloved fingers and took out an assortment of various-sized Tupperware bowls with sealed plastic lids. He set them in an orderly row in the snow before him. artie came trudging toward them, holding his wrist. The man with the ski mask looked up quickly and then continued his work, taking off his gloves and untying one of the knots in the cord so he could slide the jugs off. \"Sonofabitch get youi\" he asked artie. \"Yeah. Gashed my hand. I\u0027m okay, though. Where\u0027d you come fromi\" \"That way.\" He jerked his head toward the woods, then began to uncap the plastic jugs with rapidly reddening fingers. The animal was still kicking violently. The man stood up, pulled his rifle out of the snow and began to smash the animal\u0027s skull in with the weapon\u0027s butt. It took a minute to finish, but then the beast made a muffled, moaning sound, trembled and lay still. \"I didn\u0027t think anybody else would be coming this way,\" the man said. \"Thought everybody was long gone by now.\" He knelt again next to the body, took a knife with a long, curved blade from a pouch at his belt and cut a slit in the gray underbelly. The blood gouted. He reached for one of the plastic jugs and held it beneath the stream; the blood pattered merrily in, rapidly filling up the jug. He capped it, put it aside and reached for another as Sister and artie watched with sickened fascination. \"Thought everybody else must be dead by now,\" he continued, paying close attention to his work. \"Where are you two fromi\" \"Uh... Detroit,\" artie managed to say. \"We came from Manhattan,\" Sister told him. \"We\u0027re on our way to Detroit.\" \"You run out of gasi Have a blowouti\" \"No. We\u0027re walking.\" He grunted, glanced at her and then went back to his task. The stream of blood was weakening. \"Long way to walk,\" he said. \"Hell of a long way, especially for nothing.\" \"What do you meani\" \"I mean that there\u0027s no Detroit anymore. It was blown away. Just like there\u0027s no Pittsburgh or Indianapolis or Chicago or Philadelphia anymore. I\u0027d be surprised if any city\u0027s left. By now, I guess the radiation\u0027s done a number on the little towns, too.\" The flow of blood had almost stopped. He capped the second jug, which was about half full, and then he carved a longer slit in the dead animal\u0027s belly. He thrust his naked hands into the steaming wound up to his wrists. \"You don\u0027t know that!\" artie said. \"You can\u0027t know that!\" \"I know,\" the man replied, but he offered nothing more. \"Lady,\" he said, \"start opening those Tupperware bowls for me, will youi\" She did as he asked, and he started pulling out handfuls of bloody, steaming intestines. He chopped them up and began filling the bowls. \"Did I get that other bastardi\" he asked artie. \"Whati\" \"The other one I shot at. I think you\u0027ll remember that it was chewing on your arm.\" \"Oh. Right. Yeah.\" artie watched the guts being stuffed into brightly colored Tupperware bowls. \"No. I mean... I think you hit him, but he let me go and ran off.\" \"They can be tough motherfuckers,\" he said, and then he began to carve the animal\u0027s head from its neck. \"Open that big bowl, lady,\" he told her. He reached up into the severed head, and the brains plopped into the big bowl. \"You can put the lids on now,\" he said. Sister did, about to choke on the coppery smell of blood. He wiped his hands on the beast\u0027s hide and then slid the two jugs back on the cord and retied the knot; he put his gloves back on, returned the knife to its pouch and the filled Tupperware containers to his pack, and then rose to a standing position. \"You two got any gunsi\" \"No,\" Sister said. \"How about foodi\" \"We\u0027ve... we\u0027ve got some canned vegetables and fruit juice. and some cold cuts, too.\" \"Cold cuts,\" he repeated disdainfully. \"Lady, you can\u0027t go very far in this weather on cold cuts. You say you\u0027ve got some vegetablesi I hope it\u0027s not broccoli. I hate broccoli.\" \"No... we\u0027ve got some corn, and green beans, and boiled potatoes.\" \"Sounds like the makings of a stew to me. My cabin\u0027s about two miles north of here, as the crow flies. If you want to go back with me, you\u0027ll be welcome. If not, I\u0027ll say have a good trip to Detroit.\" \"What\u0027s the nearest towni\" Sister asked. \"St. Johns, I guess. Hazleton\u0027s the nearest town of any size, and that\u0027s about ten miles south of St. Johns. There may be a few people left, but after that flood of refugees washed in from the east I\u0027d be surprised if you\u0027d find much in any town along I-80. St. Johns is about four or five miles west.\" The man looked at artie, who was dripping blood onto the snow. \"Friend, that\u0027s going to attract every scavenger within smelling distance - and believe me, some of those bastards can sniff blood a long, long way.\" \"We ought to go with him,\" artie said to Sister. \"I might bleed to death!\" \"I doubt it,\" the man countered. \"Not from a scratch like that. It\u0027ll freeze up pretty soon, but you\u0027ll have a blood smell on your clothes. Like I say, they\u0027ll come out of the mountains with knives and forks between their teeth. But you do what you want to do; I\u0027m hitting the trail.\" He shrugged into his pack, wrapped the cord around his shoulder and picked up his rifle. \"Take care,\" he said, and he started gliding across the snowy highway toward the woods. It took Sister about two more seconds to make up her mind. \"Wait a minute!\" He stopped. \"Okay. We\u0027ll come with you, Mr. - \" But he was already moving again, heading into the edge of the dense forest. They had no choice but to hurry after him. artie looked over his shoulder, terrified of more lurking predators coming up behind him. His ribs ached where the beast had hit him, and his legs felt like short pieces of soft rubber. He and Sister entered the woods after the shuffling figure of the man in the ski mask and left the highway of death behind. Thirty-one The outlines of small, blocky one-story buildings and red brick houses began to appear from the deepening scarlet gloom. a town, Josh realized. Thank God! The wind was still shoving mightily at his back, but after what seemed like eight hours of walking yesterday and at least five today, he was about to topple to the ground. He carried the exhausted child in his arms, as he had for the past two hours, and walked stiff-legged, the soles of his feet oozing with blisters and blood in shoes that were coming apart at the seams. He thought he must look like a zombie, or like the Frankenstein monster carrying the fainted heroine in his arms. They had spent last night in the windbreak of an overturned pick-up truck; bound-up bales of hay had been scattered around, and Josh had lugged them over to build a makeshift shelter that would contain their body heat. Still, they\u0027d been out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by wasteland and dead fields, and both of them had dreaded first light because they knew they had to start walking again. The dark town - just a scatter of wind-ravaged buildings and a few widely spaced houses on dusty lots - beckoned him onward. He saw no cars, no hint of light or life. There was a Texaco station with one pump and a garage whose roof had collapsed. a sign flapping back and forth on its hinges advertised TUCKER\u0027S HaRDWaRE aND FEEDS, but the store\u0027s front window was shattered and the place looked bare as Mother Hubbard\u0027s cupboard. a small cafe had also collapsed, except for the sign that read GOOD EaTS! Every step an exercise in agony, Josh walked past the crumbled buildings. He saw that dozens of paperback books lay in the dust around him, their pages flipping wildly in the restless hand of the wind, and to the left were the remains of a little clapboard structure with a hand-painted SULLIVaN PUBLIC LIBRaRY sign. Sullivan, Josh thought. Whatever Sullivan had once been, it was dead now. Something moved at the corner of his vision. He looked to the side, and something small - a jackrabbiti he wondered - darted out of sight behind the ruins of the cafe. Josh was stiff with cold, and he knew Swan must be freezing, too. She held onto that Cookie Monster doll like life itself and occasionally flinched in her tormented sleep. He approached one of the houses but stopped when he saw a body curled up like a question mark on the front porch steps. He headed for the next house, further along and across the road. The mailbox, supported on a crooked pedestal, was painted white and had what appeared to be an eye, with upper and lower lids, painted on it in black. The hand-lettered name was Davy and Leona Skelton. Josh walked across the dirt lot and up the porch steps to the screen door. \"Swani\" he said. \"Wake up, now.\" She mumbled, and he set her down; then he tried the door but found it latched from the inside. He lifted his foot and kicked at its center, knocking it off its hinges, and they crossed the porch to the front door. Josh had just put his hand on the knob when the door flew open and the barrel of a pistol looked him in the eyes. \"You broke my screen door,\" a woman\u0027s voice said in the gloom. The pistol did not waver. \"Uh... I\u0027m sorry, ma\u0027am. I didn\u0027t think anybody was here.\" \"Why\u0027d you think the door was locked, theni This is private property!\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Josh repeated. He saw the woman\u0027s gnarled finger on the trigger. \"I don\u0027t have any money,\" he said. \"I\u0027d pay you for the door if I did.\" \"Moneyi\" She hawked and spat past him. \"Money ain\u0027t worth nothin\u0027 no more! Hell, a screen door is worth a bagful of gold, fella! I\u0027d blow your damn head off if I wouldn\u0027t have to clean up the mess!\" \"If you don\u0027t mind, we\u0027ll just go on our way.\" The woman was silent. Josh could see the outline of her head, but not her face; her head angled toward Swan. \"a little girl,\" she said softly. \"Oh, my Lord... a little girl...\" \"Leona!\" a weak voice called from inside the house. \"Leo - \" and then it was interrupted by a strangling, terrible spasm of coughing. \"It\u0027s all right, Davy!\" she called back. \"I\u0027ll be there directly!\" She turned her attention to Josh again, the pistol still stuck in his face. \"Where\u0027d you two come fromi Where\u0027re you goin\u0027i\" \"We came from... out there.\" He motioned toward one end of the town. \"and I guess we\u0027re going that way.\" He motioned to the other end. \"Not much of a travel plan.\" \"I don\u0027t guess it is,\" he agreed, uneasily watching the black eye of that pistol. She paused, looked down at the little girl again and then sighed deeply. \"Well,\" she finally said, \"since you\u0027re halfway broke in already, you might as well come on in the rest of the way.\" She motioned with the gun and retreated through the doorway. Josh took Swan\u0027s hand, and they entered the house. \"Shut the door,\" the woman said. \"Thanks to you, we\u0027ll be up to our ears in dust pretty soon.\" Josh did as she asked. a small fire was burning in the fireplace, and the woman\u0027s squat figure was outlined in red as she moved about the room. She lit a hurricane lantern on the mantel, then a second and third lantern placed strategically around the room to give the most light. The pistol was uncocked, but she kept it at her side. She finished with the lanterns and turned around to get a good look at Josh and Swan. Leona Skelton was short and wide, wearing a thick pink sweater atop ragged overalls and furry pink slippers on her feet. Her square face appeared to have been carved from an apple, then dried under the sun; there wasn\u0027t a smooth place on it for all the winding cracks and ravines. Her large, expressive blue eyes were surrounded by webs of wrinkles, and the deep lines in her broad forehead looked like a clay etching of ocean waves. Josh figured she was in her mid-to-late sixties, though her curly, swept-back hair was dyed garish red. Now, as her gaze wandered between Josh and Swan, her lips slowly parted, and Josh saw that several of her front teeth were silver. \"God a\u0027mighty,\" she said quietly. \"You two got burnt, didn\u0027t youi Oh, Jesus... I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t mean to stare, but...\" She looked at Swan, and her face seemed to compress with pain. There was a glimmer of tears in her eyes. \"Oh, Lord,\" Leona whispered. \"Oh, my Lord, you two have been... hurt so bad.\" \"We\u0027re alive,\" Josh said. \"That\u0027s what counts.\" \"Yes,\" she agreed, nodding. Her eyes found the hardwood floor. \"Forgive my rudeness. I was brought up better\u0027n that.\" \"Leona!\" the man rasped, and again he was savaged by a fit of coughing. \"I\u0027d best see to my husband,\" she said, leaving the room through a hallway. While she was gone, Josh looked around the room; it was sparsely furnished, with unpainted pine furniture and a threadbare green throw rug in front of the fireplace. He avoided peering into a mirror on one wall and walked toward a glass-fronted cabinet nearby. On the cabinet\u0027s shelves were dozens of crystal spheres of varying sizes, the smallest about pebble-sized and the largest as big as both of Josh\u0027s fists clenched together - about half as big as a bowling ball. Most of them were the size of baseballs and perfectly clear, though others held tints of blue, green and yellow. added to the collection were different kinds of feathers, some dried-out corncobs with multicolored kernels, and a couple of fragile-looking, almost transparent snake-skins. \"Where are wei\" Swan asked him, still hugging her Cookie Monster. Beneath her eyes were dark purple hollows of fatigue, and thirst burned the back of her throat. \"a little town called Sullivan. There\u0027s not much here. It looks like everybody\u0027s already gone, except these people.\" He approached the mantel to examine some framed Polaroids displayed there; in one of the pictures, Leona Skelton was sitting in a porch swing with a smiling, stout, middle-aged man who had more belly than hair, but his eyes were young and a bit mischievous behind wire-rimmed spectacles. He had his arm around Leona, and one hand appeared to be creeping toward her lap. She was laughing, her mouth full of silver flash, and her hair wasn\u0027t quite as red; in any event, she appeared to be at least fifteen years younger. In another picture, Leona was rocking a white cat in her arms like a baby, the cat\u0027s feet stuck up contentedly in the air. a third picture showed the pot-bellied man with a younger fellow, both of them carrying fishing rods and displaying bite-sized fish. \"That\u0027s my family,\" Leona said, coming into the room. She had left the gun behind. \"My husband\u0027s name is Davy, our son\u0027s named Joe and the cat\u0027s called Cleopatra. Was called Cleopatra, I mean. I buried her about two weeks ago, out back. Put her deep, so nothin\u0027 could get at her. Have you two got names, or were you hatchedi\" \"I\u0027m Josh Hutchins. This is Sue Wanda, but she\u0027s called Swan.\" \"Swan,\" Leona repeated. \"That\u0027s a pretty name. I\u0027m pleased to meet the both of you.\" \"Thank you,\" Swan said, not forgetting her manners. \"Oh, Lordy!\" Leona bent and picked up some farming and House Beautiful magazines that had tumbled off the coffee table, and then she took a broom from the corner and started sweeping dust toward the fireplace. \"House is a godawful wreck!\" she apologized as she worked. \"Used to be able to keep it as neat as a needle, but lately time slips away. I ain\u0027t had no visitors for quite a number of days!\" She swept up the last of the dust and stood staring out a window at the red gloom and the wind-lashed remains of Sullivan. \"Used to be a fine town,\" she said listlessly. \"Had more\u0027n three hundred people livin\u0027 right around here. Fine people, too. Ben McCormick used to say he was fat enough to make three more folks. Drew and Sissy Stimmons lived in that house, over there.\" She pointed. \"Oh, Sissy loved her hats! Had about thirty of \u0027em, wore a different hat every Sunday for thirty Sundays and then started over again. Kyle Doss owned the cafe. Geneva Dewberry ran the public library, and oh, Lordy, could she talk about books!\" Her voice was getting quieter and quieter, drifting away. \"Geneva said she was gonna sit down and write herself a romance someday. I always believed she would.\" She motioned in another direction. \"Norm Barkley lived down there at the end of the road. You can\u0027t see the house from here, though. I almost married Norman, when I was a young thing. But Davy stole me away with a rose and a kiss on a Saturday night. Yes, sir.\" She nodded, and then she seemed to remember where she was. Her spine stiffened, and she returned the broom to its corner as if she were giving up a dance partner. \"Well,\" she said, \"that was our town.\" \"Where\u0027d they all goi\" Josh asked. \"Heaven,\" she replied. \"Or Hell. Whichever claimed them first, I reckon. Oh, some of \u0027em packed up and lit out.\" She shrugged. \"Where to, I can\u0027t say. But most of us stayed here, in our homes and on our land. Then the sickness started hitting folks... and Death moved in. It\u0027s like a big fist a-knockin\u0027 at your door - boom boom, boom boom, like that. and you know you can\u0027t keep it from comin\u0027 in, but you got to try.\" She moistened her lips with her tongue, her eyes glazed and distant. \"Sure is some kinda crazy weather for august, ain\u0027t iti Cold enough to freeze a witch\u0027s tit.\" \"You... do know what\u0027s happened, don\u0027t youi\" She nodded. \"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"Lee Procter had the radio goin\u0027 full blast at the hardware store when I was there buyin\u0027 nails and wire to hang a picture. I don\u0027t know what station he was tuned to, but all of a sudden there was a godawful squallin\u0027, and this man\u0027s voice came on talkin\u0027 real fast about a state of emergency and bombs and all. Then there was a sizzlin\u0027 noise like grease in a hot skillet and the radio went dead. Couldn\u0027t raise a whisper on it. Wilma James come runnin\u0027 in, yellin\u0027 for everybody to look up at the sky. We went out and looked, and we seen the airplanes or bombs or whatever they were passin\u0027 overhead, some of \u0027em near about to collide with each other. and Grange Tucker said, \u0027It\u0027s happenin\u0027!\u0027 armageddon is happenin\u0027!\u0027 and he just plopped down on the curb in front of his store and watched those things fly past. \"Then the wind came, and the dust, and the cold,\" she said, still staring out the window. \"The sun went blood-red. Twisters passed through, and one of \u0027em hit the McCormick farm and just took it away, didn\u0027t leave nothin\u0027 but foundation stones. Not a trace of Ben, Ginny or the kids. \u0027Course, everybody in town started comin\u0027 to me, wantin\u0027 to know what lay in the future and all.\" She shrugged. \"I couldn\u0027t tell \u0027em I saw skulls where their faces used to be. How can you tell your friends somethin\u0027 like thati Well, Mr. Laney - the postman from Russell County - didn\u0027t show up, and the phone lines were down and there was no \u0027lectricity. We knew whatever had happened had been a whomper. Kyle Doss and Eddie Meachum volunteered to drive the twenty miles to Matheson and find out what was goin\u0027 on. They never come back. I saw skulls where their faces were, too, but what could I sayi You know, sometimes there just ain\u0027t no sense in tellin\u0027 somebody their time\u0027s about up.\" Josh wasn\u0027t following the old woman\u0027s ramblings. \"What do you mean, you saw skulls where their faces werei\" \"Oh. Sorry. I forget that everybody beyond Sullivan don\u0027t know about me.\" Leona Skelton turned from the window, a faint smile on her dried-apple face. She picked up one of the lamps, walked across the room to a bookcase and withdrew a leather-bound scrapbook; she took it to Josh and opened it. \"There you go,\" she said. \"That\u0027s me.\" She pointed to a yellowed picture and article, carefully scissored from a pulp magazine. The headline read, KaNSaS SEER FORETOLD KENNEDY DEaTH 6 MONTHS BEFORE DIXON! and below that, a smaller line proclaimed, Leona Skelton sees riches, new prosperity for america! The photograph showed a much younger Leona Skelton surrounded by cats and crystal balls. \"That\u0027s from Fate magazine, back in 1964. See, I wrote a letter to President Kennedy warning him to stay out of Dallas, because he was giving a speech on television and I saw a skull where his face was, and then I used the tarot cards and the Ouija board and found out that Kennedy had a powerful enemy in Dallas, Texas. I even got part of the name, but it came out as Osbald. anyway, I wrote this letter, and I even made a copy of it.\" She flipped the page, showing him a battered, almost illegible handwritten letter dated april 19, 1963. \"Two FBI men came to the house and wanted to have a long talk with me. I was pretty calm, but they like to have scared poor Davy out of his clodhoppers! Oh, they were silky-talkin\u0027 fellas, but they could look a hole right through you! I saw they thought I was a crazy lunatic, and they told me not to write any more letters and then they left.\" She turned another page. The headline on this article read TOUCHED BY aN aNGEL aT BIRTH, KaNSaS \u0027JEaNNE DIXON\u0027 VOWS. \"That\u0027s from the National Tattler, about 1965. I just happened to mention to that writer lady that my mama always told me she had a vision of an angel in white robes kissin\u0027 my forehead when I was a baby. anyway, this one came out right after I found a little boy who\u0027d been missin\u0027 from his folks in Kansas City. He just got mad and ran away from home, and he was hidin\u0027 in an old house about two blocks away.\" She flipped more pages, proudly pointing to different articles from the Star, the Enquirer, and Fate magazine. The last article, in a small Kansas newspaper, was printed in 1987. \"I haven\u0027t been doin\u0027 so well lately,\" she said. \"Sinus trouble and arthritis. Kinda clouded me up, I guess. anyway, that\u0027s who I am.\" Josh grunted. He\u0027d never believed in extrasensory perception, but from what he\u0027d witnessed lately, anything was possible. \"I noticed your crystal balls over there.\" \"That\u0027s my most favorite collection! Those are from all over the world, you know!\" \"They\u0027re real pretty,\" Swan added. \"Thank you kindly, little lady.\" She smiled down at Swan, then returned her gaze to Josh. \"You know, I didn\u0027t see this thing happenin\u0027. Maybe I\u0027m gettin\u0027 too old to see much anymore. But I had a bad, deep-down gut feelin\u0027 about that astro-nut president. I thought he was the kind to let too many cooks stir the pot. Davy and me, neither one of us voted for him, no sir!\" The coughing rattled from the back room again. Leona cocked her head, listening intently, but the coughing faded, and Leona visibly relaxed once more. \"I don\u0027t have much to offer in the way of food,\" she explained. \"Got some old corn muffins as hard as cinder blocks and a pot of vegetable soup. I can still do my cookin\u0027 over the fireplace, but I\u0027ve gotten used to eatin\u0027 food that\u0027s as cold as a virgin\u0027s bed. Got a well in the back yard that still pumps up clean water. So you\u0027re welcome to whatever you\u0027ll have.\" \"Thank you,\" Josh said. \"I think some soup and corn muffins would be pretty fine, cold or not. Is there any way I can get some of this dirt off mei\" \"You mean you want to take a bathi\" She thought for a minute. \"Well, I reckon we can do it the old-fashioned way: heat buckets of water in the fire and fill the tub up like that. Little lady, I expect you ought to scrub up, too. \u0027Course, my drains might clog with all the dirt, and I don\u0027t believe the plumber makes housecalls anymore. What\u0027ve you two been doin\u0027i Rollin\u0027 in the groundi\" \"Sort of,\" Swan said. She thought a bath - warm water or cold - was a fine idea. She knew she smelled like a pigsty; still, she was afraid of what her skin might look like under all the dirt. She knew it wasn\u0027t going to be very pretty. \"I\u0027ll fetch you a couple of buckets, then, and you can pump your own water. Which one wants to go firsti\" Josh shrugged and motioned to Swan. \"all righty. I\u0027d help you pump, but I\u0027ve got to be close to Davy in case he has a spell. You bring the buckets in, and we\u0027ll warm \u0027em up in the fireplace. I\u0027ve got a nice claw-footed bathtub that hasn\u0027t nestled a body since this damned mess started.\" Swan nodded and said thank you, and Leona Skelton waddled off to get the buckets from the kitchen. In the back bedroom, Davy Skelton coughed violently a few times, then the noise subsided. Josh was tempted to step back there and take a look at the man, but didn\u0027t. That coughing sounded bad; it reminded him of Darleen\u0027s coughing just before she\u0027d died. He figured it must be radiation poisoning. \"The sickness started hitting folks,\" Leona had said. Radiation poisoning must have wiped out almost the whole town. But it had occurred to Josh that some people might be able to resist the radiation better than others; maybe it poleaxed some right off and slowly crept up on the rest. He was tired and weak from walking, but otherwise he felt okay; Swan, too, was in pretty good shape except for her burns, and Leona Skelton seemed healthy enough. Back in the basement, Darleen had been fit and boisterous one day, laid low and scalding with fever the next. Maybe some people could go for weeks or months without feeling the full effects of it. He hoped. But right now the idea of a warm bath and a meal eaten from a bowl with a real spoon made him delirious. \"You okayi\" he asked Swan, who stared into space. \"I\u0027m better,\" she replied, but her mind had drifted back to her mama, lying dead under the dirt, and to what PawPaw - or whatever had taken hold of PawPaw - had said. What did it meani What was the giant supposed to protect her fromi and why heri She thought of the green seedlings growing from the dirt in the shape of her body. Nothing like that had ever happened to her before. She really hadn\u0027t even had to do anything, not even knead the dirt between her hands. Of course, she was used to the tingling sensation, to feeling sometimes like a fountain of energy was coming up from the earth and through her backbone... but this was different. Something had changed, she thought. I could always make flowers grow. Bringing them up from wet earth when the sun shone down was easy. But she\u0027d made grass grow in the dark, without water, and she hadn\u0027t even tried. Something had changed. and it came to her, just like that: I\u0027m stronger than I was before. Josh crossed to the window and peered out at the dead town, leaving Swan alone with her thoughts. a figure caught his attention out there - a small animal of some kind, standing in the wind. Its head lifted, watching Josh. a dog, he realized. a little terrier. They stared at each other for a few seconds - and then the dog darted away. Good luck to you, he thought, and then he turned away, because he knew the animal was bound to die, and he had a sickened gutful of death. Davy coughed twice and called weakly for Leona. She brought the buckets in from the kitchen for Swan\u0027s bathwater, and then she hurried back to see about her husband. Thirty-two Sister and artie had found a little piece of Heaven. They walked into a small log cabin, hidden in a grove of naked evergreens on the shore of an ice-skimmed lake, and into the wonderful warmth of a kerosene space heater. Tears almost burst from Sister\u0027s eyes as she stumbled across the threshold, and artie gasped with pleasure. \"This is the place,\" the man in the ski mask said. Four other people were already in the cabin: a man and woman, both dressed in ragged summer clothing, who appeared to be young, maybe in their early twenties - but it was hard to tell, because both of them had severe, brown-crusted burns in weird geometric shapes on their faces and arms and under the torn places of their clothing. The young man\u0027s dark hair hung almost to his shoulders, but the crown of his scalp was burned bald and splotched with the brown marks. The woman might have been pretty, with large blue eyes and the fine bones of a fashion model, but her curly auburn hair was almost all scorched away, and the brown crusted marks lay diagonally, like precise penstrokes, across her face. She was wearing cutoff blue jeans and sandals, and her bare legs were also splotched with burns. Her feet were swathed in rags, and she was curled up next to the heater. The other two were a thin older man, maybe in his mid-fifties, with bright blue burns disfiguring his face, and a teen-aged boy, sixteen or so, wearing jeans and a T-shirt with BLaCK FLaG LIVES! in untidy, scrawled letters on the front. Two small studs were pinned in the boy\u0027s left earlobe, and he had all of his rooster-cut orange hair, but gray burn marks streamed down his strong-jawed face as if someone had lit a candle over his forehead and let the wax drip. His deep-socketed green eyes watched Sister and artie with a hint of amusement. \"Meet my other guests,\" the man in the ski mask said, laying his pack on a bloodstained porcelain counter next to the sink after he\u0027d shut the door and latched it. \"Kevin and Mona Ramsey\" - he motioned toward the young couple - \"Steve Buchanan\" - toward the teenage boy - \"and the most I can get out of the old man is that he\u0027s from Union City. I didn\u0027t get your names.\" \"artie Wisco.\" \"You can call me Sister,\" she said. \"What\u0027s yoursi\" He peeled off the ski mask and hung it on the hook of a coatrack. \"Paul Thorson,\" he told her. \"Citizen of the world.\" He took off the jugs of blood and lifted the Tupperware bowls with their grisly contents from his pack. Sister was shocked. Paul Thorson\u0027s face was unmarked by burns, and it had been a long time since Sister had seen a normal human face. He had long black hair flecked with gray, and gray swirled back from the corners of his mouth in his full black beard. His flesh was white from lack of sunshine, but it was weathered and wrinkled, and he had a high, deeply creased forehead and the rough-hewn look of an outdoorsman. Sister thought he resembled a mountain man, somebody who might have lived alone in a shack and come down to the valley only to trap beavers or something. Beneath black eyebrows, his eyes were a frosty gray-blue surrounded by dark circles of weariness. He shrugged off his parka - which had made him appear a lot heftier than he actually was - and hung that up as well, then started dumping the contents of the bowls into the sink. \"Sister,\" he said, \"let\u0027s have some of those vegetables you\u0027re carrying around. We\u0027re going to have asshole stew tonight, folks.\" \"asshole stewi\" Sister asked, and frowned. \"Uh... what the hell is thati\" \"It means you\u0027re a stupid asshole if you don\u0027t eat it, because that\u0027s all we\u0027ve got. Come on, let\u0027s have the cans.\" \"We\u0027re going to eat... thati\" artie recoiled from the bloody mess. His ribs were hurting, and he had his hand pressed on the pain under his coat. \"It\u0027s not too bad, man,\" the teenager with orange hair said, in a flat Brooklyn accent. \"You get used to it. Hell, one of those fuckers tried to eat me. Serves \u0027em right to be eaten by us, huhi\" \"absolutely,\" Paul agreed, going to work with his knife. Sister took off her pack, opened the duffel bag and gave him some of the canned vegetables. Paul opened them with a can opener and dumped them into a big iron pot. Sister shuddered, but the man obviously knew what he was doing. The cabin seemed to be only two large rooms. In this front room, along with the space heater, was a small fireplace of rough stones, a fire burning cheerfully within it and throwing off more warmth and light. a few candles melded to saucers and a kerosene lamp were set around the room, which contained two unrolled sleeping bags, a cot, and a nest of newspapers tucked away in a corner. a cast-iron stove and a good-sized pile of split logs stood on the other side of the room, and when Paul said, \"Steve, you can get the stove going now,\" the boy got up off the floor, took a shovel from beside the fireplace and put burning pieces of wood into the stove. Sister felt a new rush of joy. They were going to have a hot meal! \"It\u0027s time now,\" the old man spoke up, looking at Paul. \"It\u0027s time, isn\u0027t iti\" Paul glanced at his wristwatch. \"Nope. Not quite yet.\" He continued chopping up the intestines and brains, and Sister noted that his fingers were long and slender. He had artistic hands, she thought - particularly unsuited to the task they were now performing. \"This your placei\" she asked. He nodded. \"Been living here... oh, about four years now. During the summer, I\u0027m the caretaker for the Big Pines Ski area, about six or seven miles that way.\" He motioned in the direction of the lake behind the cabin. \"In the winter, I cozy on in and live off the land.\" He glanced up and smiled grimly. \"Winter came early this year.\" \"What were you doing on the highwayi\" \"The wolves go up there to chow down. I go up there to hunt wolves. That\u0027s how I found all these other poor souls, wandering around on I-80. I\u0027ve found quite a few more, too. Their graves are out back. I\u0027ll show you, if you like.\" She shook her head. \"See, the wolves have always lived in the mountains. They\u0027ve never had reason to come down before. They eat rabbits, deer, and whatever other animals they can find. But now the small animals are dying in their holes, and the wolves can smell new food. So they\u0027re coming down in droves to Supermarket I-80 for the freshest meat. These people made it here before the snow started falling - if you can call that radioactive shit snow.\" He grunted with disgust. \"anyway, the food chain\u0027s been knocked off kilter. No small animals for the big ones to eat. Just people. and the wolves are getting real desperate - and real brave.\" He plopped the hunks of innards into the pot, then uncapped one of the blood jugs and poured the stuff in. The smell of blood permeated the room. \"More wood in there, Steve. We want this shit to boil.\" \"Right.\" \"I know it\u0027s time!\" the old man whined. \"It\u0027s got to be!\" \"No, it\u0027s not,\" Kevin Ramsey told him. \"Not until after we\u0027ve had our food.\" Paul added the other jug of blood to the pot and began to stir it with a wooden spoon. \"You people might as well take off your coats and stay for dinner, unless you want to head for the next restaurant down the road.\" Sister and artie looked at each other, both of them queasy from the smell of the stew. Sister was the first to take off her gloves, coat and woolen cap, and then artie reluctantly did the same. \"Okay.\" Paul lifted the pot and put it on one of the stove\u0027s burners. \"Stoke that baby\u0027s engine and let\u0027s get the fire up.\" as Steve Buchanan worked on the fire, Paul turned to a cupboard and produced a bottle that still had a little red wine left in it. \"This is the last soldier,\" he told them. \"Everybody gets one good jolt.\" \"Wait.\" Sister unzipped her knapsack again and brought out the six-pack of Olympia beer. \"This might go better with the stew.\" Their eyes lit up like penny candles. \"My God!\" Paul said. \"Lady, you just bought my soul.\" He gingerly touched the six-pack as if afraid it might evaporate, and when it didn\u0027t, he worked one can from its plastic ring. He shook it carefully, was pleased to find it hadn\u0027t frozen. Then he popped the tab and tilted it to his mouth, drinking long and deep with his eyes closed in rapture. Sister handed beers to everyone but artie and shared the bottle of Perrier with him. It wasn\u0027t as satisfying as the beer, but it tasted fine anyway. The asshole stew made the cabin reek like a slaughterhouse. From outside came a low, distant howling. \"They smell it,\" Paul said, glancing out a window. \"Oh, those bastards are going to be all around this place in a few minutes!\" The howling continued and grew as more wolf voices added dissonant notes and vibrato. \"It\u0027s got to be time!\" the old man insisted after he\u0027d finished his beer. \"Isn\u0027t iti\" \"It\u0027s almost time.\" Mona Ramsey had a gentle, lovely voice. \"But not yet. Not yet.\" Steve was stirring the pot. \"It\u0027s boiling. I think the shit\u0027s as ready as it\u0027s gonna be.\" \"Great.\" artie\u0027s stomach was about to curdle. Paul ladled the stew out in brown clay bowls. It was thicker than Sister had thought it would be, and the smell was heavy, but not quite as bad as some of the things she\u0027d scavenged from garbage bags back in Manhattan. The stuff was dark red, and if you didn\u0027t look too closely you might have thought it was just a bowl of hearty beef stew. Outside, the wolves howled in unison, much closer to the cabin than before, as if they knew that one of their kin was about to go down human gullets.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/swan-song/page-9.html","bookId":2476,"book":{"id":2476,"title":"Swan Song","description":"Storyline: In a wasteland born of rage and fear, populated by monstrous creatures and marauding armies, earth\u0027s last survivors have been drawn into the final battle between good and evil, that will decide the fate of humanity: Sister, who discovers a strange and transformative glass artifact in the destroyed Manhattan streets . . .
