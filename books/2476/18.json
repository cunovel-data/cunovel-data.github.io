{"id":83275,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"She towered over her captors. They were children. all of them were thin and dirty, the youngest about nine or ten and the oldest maybe sixteen - and all of them stared as one at the pulsing glass ring. Fifty-six Herded before a yelling, rowdy gang of twenty-seven boy bandits, Paul, Sister and Hugh were prodded with the barrels of rifles and sharp spear tips through the snowy woods. about a hundred yards from the road, they were commanded to stop, and they waited while a few of the boys cleared brush and branches from the mouth of a small cave. a rifle barrel pushed Sister inside, and the others followed. Beyond the opening, the cave widened into a large, high-ceilinged chamber. It was damp within, but dozens of candles were set about and burning, and at the center of the cavern a small fire glowed, the smoke curling up through a hole in the ceiling. Eight other boys, all of them skinny and sickly-looking, were waiting for their compatriots to return, and when the bags were flung open the boys shouted and laughed as Sister\u0027s and Paul\u0027s extra clothes were scattered. The bandits grabbed up ill-fitting coats and sweaters, draped themselves with woolen scarves and caps and danced around the fire like apaches. One of them uncorked a jug of the moonshine that Hugh had brought along, and the snouts grew louder, the dancing wilder. adding to the raucous clamor was the noise of wood blocks clapped together, rattling gourds and sticks beating a rhythm on a cardboard box. Hugh balanced himself precariously on his crutch and single leg as the boys whirled around him, stabbing at him with their spears. He\u0027d heard stories of the forest bandits before, and he didn\u0027t like the idea of being scalped and skinned. \"Don\u0027t kill us!\" he shouted over the tumult. \"Please don\u0027t - \" and then he went down on his rump as a tough-looking ten-year-old with shaggy black hair kicked his crutch out from under him. a gale of laughter followed him down, and more spears and guns poked at Paul and Sister. She looked across the cave and saw through the haze of smoke a small, thin boy with red hair and a chalky complexion. He was holding the glass ring between his hands, staring at it intently - and then a second boy grabbed it away from him and ran with it. a third boy attacked that one, trying to get his hands on the treasure. Sister saw a throng of raggedly dressed boys jostling and fighting in the exhilaration of the hunt, and she lost sight of the glass ring. another boy shoved her own shotgun in her face and grinned at her as if daring her to make a move. Then he whirled away, grabbed the jug of moonshine and joined the victory dance. Paul helped Hugh up. a spear jabbed Paul in the ribs, and he turned angrily toward his tormentor, but Sister grasped his arm to hold him back. a boy with the bones of small animals tied in his tangled blond hair thrust a spear at Sister\u0027s face and drew it back just short of impaling an eyeball. She stared at him impassively, and he giggled like a hyena and capered away. The boy who\u0027d taken Paul\u0027s Magnum danced past, hardly able to hold the heavy weapon in a two-handed grip. The jug of moonshine was being passed around, inflaming them to further frenzy. Sister was afraid they were going to start firing their guns at random, and in a confined place like this the ricochets would be deadly. She saw the glimmer of the glass ring as one boy grabbed it from another; then two boys were fighting for it, and Sister was sick at the thought of the glass ring lying shattered. She took a step forward, but the darting of a half-dozen spears kept her back. and then the horrible thing happened: one of the boys, already dizzy with moonshine, lifted the glass ring over his head - and he was tackled from behind by another boy trying to grab it. The ring flew from his hands and spun through the air, and Sister felt a scream welling up. She saw it falling, as if in terrible slow motion, toward the stone floor, and she heard herself shout \"No!\" but there was nothing she could do. The circle of glass was falling... falling... falling. a hand grasped it before it hit the floor, and the ring glittered with fiery colors as if meteors were exploding within it. It had been caught by the figure in the cowled coat who\u0027d landed on the Jeep\u0027s hood. He was taller than the others by at least a foot, and as he approached Sister the boys around him parted to give him room. His face was still obscured by the cowl. The shouting and noise of clapping wood blocks and drumbeats faltered and began to fade as the tallest boy walked unhurriedly through the others. The glass circle flared with a strong, slow pulse. and then the boy stood in front of Sister. \"What is thisi\" he asked, holding the ring before him. The others had stopped dancing and shouting, and they began to crowd around to watch. \"It belongs to me,\" Sister answered. \"No. It used to belong to you. I asked you what it is.\" \"It\u0027s - \" She paused, trying to decide what to say. \"It\u0027s magic,\" she told him. \"It\u0027s a miracle, if you know how to use it. Please - \" She heard the unaccustomed sound of pleading in her voice. \"Please don\u0027t break it.\" \"What if I didi What if I was to let it fall and breaki Would the magic spill outi\" She was silent, knowing the boy was taunting her. He pulled the cowl back to reveal his face. \"I don\u0027t believe in magic,\" he said. \"That\u0027s just for fools and kids.\" He was older than the others - maybe seventeen or eighteen. He was almost as tall as she was, and the size of his shoulders said that he was going to be a large man when he grew up and filled out. His face was lean and pallid, with sharp cheekbones and eyes the color of ashes; in his shoulder-length dark brown hair were braided small bones and feathers, and he looked as dour and serious as an Indian chief. The fine, light brown hairs of a beard covered the lower part of his face, but Sister could see that he had a strong, square jawline. Thick, dark eyebrows added to his stern countenance, and the bridge of his nose was flattened and crooked like a boxer\u0027s. He was a handsome young man, but certainly dangerous. and, Sister realized, he was neither a kid nor a fool. He regarded the glass ring in silence. Then: \"Where were you goingi\" \"Mary\u0027s Rest,\" Hugh spoke up nervously. \"We\u0027re just poor travelers. We don\u0027t mean any - \" \"Shut up,\" the boy ordered, and Hugh\u0027s mouth snapped closed. He locked stares with Paul for a few seconds, then grunted and dismissed him. \"Mary\u0027s Rest,\" the boy repeated. \"You\u0027re about fifteen miles east of Mary\u0027s Rest. Why were you going therei\" \"We were going to pass through it on our way south,\" Sister said. \"We figured we\u0027d get some food and water.\" \"Is that soi Well, you\u0027re out of luck, then. The food\u0027s almost gone in Mary\u0027s Rest. They\u0027re starving over there, and their pond went dry about five months ago. They\u0027re melting snow to drink, just like everybody else.\" \"There\u0027s radiation in the snow,\" Hugh said. \"Drinking melted snow will kill you.\" \"What are youi an experti\" \"No, but I\u0027m - I was - a doctor, and I know what I\u0027m talking about.\" \"a doctori What kind of doctori\" \"I was a surgeon,\" Hugh said, pride creeping back into his voice. \"I used to be the best surgeon in amarillo.\" \"a surgeoni You mean you operated on sick peoplei\" \"That\u0027s right. and I never lost a patient, either.\" Sister decided to take a step forward. Instantly the boy\u0027s hand went to a pistol at his belt under the coat. \"Listen,\" Sister said, \"let\u0027s cut this screwing around. You\u0027ve already got everything we own. We\u0027ll walk the rest of the way - but I want that glass ring back. I want it now. If you\u0027re going to kill me, you\u0027d better do it, because either you give me the ring or I\u0027m taking it from you.\" The boy remained motionless, his hawklike stare challenging her. Here goes! she thought, her heart hammering. She started to reach toward him, but suddenly he laughed and stepped back. He held the ring up, as if he might drop it to the cavern\u0027s floor. Sister stopped. \"Don\u0027t,\" she said. \"Please don\u0027t.\" His hand lingered in the air. Sister tensed, ready to go for it if the fingers opened. \"Robini\" a weak voice called from the back of the cave. \"Robini\" The boy looked into Sister\u0027s face for a few seconds longer, his eyes hard and shrewd; then he blinked, lowered his arm and offered the ring to her. \"Here. It\u0027s not worth a shit, anyway.\" She took it, relief coursing through her bones. \"None of you are going anywhere,\" the boy said. \"Especially not you, Doc.\" \"Huhi\" Terror lanced him. \"Walk to the back of the cave,\" the boy commanded. \"all of you.\" They hesitated. \"Now,\" he said, in a voice that was used to being obeyed. They did as he said, and in another moment Sister saw several more figures at the rear of the chamber. Three of them were boys with Job\u0027s Mask in varying stages of severity, one of them hardly able to keep his misshapen head upright. On the floor in a corner, lying on a bed of straw and leaves, was a thin brown-haired boy of about ten or eleven, his face shining with the sweat of fever. a dressing of greasy-looking leaves had been plastered on his white chest, just under the heart, and blood had leaked out around it. The wounded boy tried to lift his head when he saw them, but he didn\u0027t have enough strength. \"Robini\" he whispered. \"You therei\" \"I\u0027m here, Bucky.\" Robin bent beside him and brushed the wet hair from the other boy\u0027s forehead. \"I\u0027m hurting... so bad.\" Bucky coughed, and foamy blood appeared at his lips. Robin quickly wiped it away with a leaf. \"You won\u0027t let me go out where it\u0027s dark, will youi\" \"No,\" Robin said quietly. \"I won\u0027t let you go out where it\u0027s dark.\" He looked up at Sister with eyes that were a hundred years old. \"Bucky got shot three days ago.\" With gentle fingers, he carefully peeled the plaster of leaves away. The wound was an ugly scarlet hole with puffy gray edges of infection. Robin\u0027s gaze moved to Hugh, then to the glass ring. \"I don\u0027t believe in magic or miracles,\" he said. \"But maybe it\u0027s kind of a miracle that we found you today, Doc. You\u0027re going to take the bullet out.\" \"Mei\" Hugh almost choked. \"Oh, no. I can\u0027t. Not me.\" \"You said you used to operate on sick people. You said you never lost a patient.\" \"That was a lifetime ago!\" Hugh wailed. \"Look at that wound! It\u0027s too close to the heart!\" He held up a palsied hand. \"I couldn\u0027t cut lettuce with a hand like this!\" Robin stood up and approached Hugh until they were almost nose to nose. \"You\u0027re a doctor,\" he said. \"You\u0027re going to take the bullet out and make him well, or you can start digging graves for you and your friends.\" \"I can\u0027t! There are no instruments here, no light, no disinfectants, no sedatives! I haven\u0027t operated in seven years, and I wasn\u0027t a heart surgeon, anyway! No. I\u0027m sorry. That boy doesn\u0027t have a - \" Robin\u0027s pistol was cocked and pressed against Hugh\u0027s throat. \"a doctor who can\u0027t help anybody shouldn\u0027t be living. You\u0027re just using up air, aren\u0027t youi\" \"Please... please...\" Hugh gasped, his eyes bulging. \"Wait a minute,\" Sister said. \"Hugh, the hole\u0027s already there. all you have to do is bring the bullet out.\" \"Oh, sure! Sure! Just bring the bullet out!\" Hugh giggled, on the edge of hysteria. \"Sister, the bullet could be anywhere! What am I supposed to stop the blood withi How am I supposed to dig the damned thing out - with my fingersi\" \"We\u0027ve got knives,\" Robin told him. \"We can heat them in the fire. That makes them clean, doesn\u0027t iti\" \"There\u0027s no such thing as \u0027clean\u0027 in conditions like these! My God, you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re asking me to do!\" \"Not asking. Telling. Do it, Doc.\" Hugh looked to Paul and Sister for help, but there was nothing they could do. \"I can\u0027t,\" he whispered hoarsely. \"Please... I\u0027ll kill him if I try to take the bullet out.\" \"He\u0027ll die for sure if you don\u0027t. I\u0027m the leader here. When I give my word, I keep it. Bucky got shot because I sent him out with some others to stop a truck passing through. But he wasn\u0027t ready to kill anybody yet, and he wasn\u0027t fast enough to dodge a bullet, either.\" He jabbed the pistol into Hugh\u0027s throat. \"I am ready to kill. I\u0027ve done it before. Now, I promised Bucky I\u0027d do whatever I could for him. So - do you take the bullet out, or do I kill all of youi\" Hugh swallowed, his eyes watering with fear. \"There\u0027s... there\u0027s so much I\u0027ve forgotten.\" \"Remember it. Real quick.\" Hugh was shaking. He closed his eyes, opened them again. The boy was still there. His whole body was a heartbeat. What do I rememberi he asked himself. Think, damn it! Nothing would come together; it was all a hazy jumble. The boy was waiting, his finger on the trigger. Hugh realized he would have to go on instinct, and God help them all if he screwed up. \"Somebody\u0027s... going to have to support me,\" he managed to say. \"My balance isn\u0027t so good. and light. I\u0027ve got to have light, as much as I can get. I need - \" Think! \" - three or four sharp knives with narrow blades. Rub them with ashes and put them in the fire. I need rags, and... oh, Jesus, I need clamps and forceps and probes and I cannot kilt this boy, damn you!\" His eyes blazed at Robin. \"I\u0027ll get you what you need. None of that medical shit, though. But I\u0027ll get you the other stuff.\" \"and moonshine,\" Hugh said. \"The jug. For both the boy and myself. I want some ashes to clean my hands with, and I may need a bucket to puke into.\" He reached up with a trembling hand and pushed the pistol away from his throat. \"What\u0027s your name, young mani\" \"Robin Oakes.\" \"all right, then, Mr. Oakes. When I start, you\u0027re not to lay a finger on me. No matter what I do, no matter what you think I ought to be doing. I\u0027ll be scared enough for both of us.\" Hugh looked down at the wound and winced; it was very, very nasty. \"What kind of gun was he shot withi\" \"I don\u0027t know. a pistol, I guess.\" \"That doesn\u0027t tell me anything about the size of the bullet. Oh, Jesus, this is crazy! I can\u0027t remove a bullet from a wound that close to - \" The pistol swung back up again. Hugh saw the boy\u0027s finger ready on the trigger, and something about being so close to death clicked on the faiade of arrogance he had worn back in amarillo. \"Get that gun out of my face, you little swine,\" he said, and he saw Robin blink. \"I\u0027ll do what I can - but I\u0027m not promising a miracle, do you understandi Welli What are you standing there fori Get me what I need!\" Robin lowered the pistol. He went off to get the moonshine, the knives and the ashes. It took about twenty minutes to get Bucky as drunk as Hugh wanted him. Under Robin\u0027s direction, the other boys brought candles and set them in a circle around Bucky. Hugh scrubbed his hands in ashes and waited for the blades to cook. \"He called you Sister,\" Robin said. \"are you a nuni\" \"No. That\u0027s just my name.\" \"Oh.\" He sounded disappointed, and Sister decided to ask, \"Whyi\" Robin shrugged. \"We used to have nuns where we were, in the big building. I used to call them blackbirds, because they always flew at you when they thought you\u0027d done something wrong. But some of them were okay. Sister Margaret said she was sure things would work out for me. Like getting a family and a home and everything.\" He glanced around the cavern. \"Some home, huhi\" It dawned on Sister what Robin was talking about. \"You lived in an orphanagei\" \"Yeah. Everybody did. a lot of us got sick and died after it turned cold. Especially the really young ones.\" His eyes darkened. \"Father Thomas died, and we buried him behind the big building. Sister Lynn died, and then so did Sister May and Sister Margaret. Father Cummings left in the night. I don\u0027t blame him - who wants to take care of a bunch of ratty punksi Some of the others left, too. The last to die was Father Clinton, and then it was just us.\" \"Weren\u0027t there any older boys with youi\" \"Oh, yeah. a few of them stayed, but most took off on their own. Somehow, I guess I got to be the oldest. I figured that if I left, who was going to take care of the punksi\" \"So you found this cave and started robbing peoplei\" \"Sure. Why noti I mean, the world\u0027s gone crazy, hasn\u0027t iti Why shouldn\u0027t we rob people if it\u0027s the only way to stay alivei\" \"Because it\u0027s wrong,\" Sister answered. The boy laughed. She let his laugh die, and then she said, \"How many people have you killedi\" all traces of a smile left his face. He stared at his hands; they were a man\u0027s hands, rough and callused. \"Four. But all of them would\u0027ve killed me, too.\" He shrugged uneasily. \"No big deal.\" \"The knives are ready,\" Paul said, returning from the fire. Standing on his crutch over the wounded boy, Hugh took a deep breath and lowered his head. He stayed that way for a minute. \"all right.\" His voice was low and resigned. \"Bring the knives over. Sister, will you kneel down beside me and keep me steady, pleasei I\u0027ll need several boys to hold Bucky securely, too. We don\u0027t want him thrashing around.\" \"Can we just knock him out or somethingi\" Robin asked. \"No. There\u0027s a risk of brain damage in that, and the first impulse a person has after being knocked unconscious is to throw up. We don\u0027t want that, do wei Paul, would you hold Bucky\u0027s legsi I hope seeing a little blood doesn\u0027t make you sick.\" \"It doesn\u0027t,\" Paul said, and Sister recalled the day on I-80 when he\u0027d sliced open a wolf\u0027s belly. The hot knives were brought in a metal pot. Sister knelt beside Hugh and let him lean his feeble weight against her. She laid the glass ring beside her on the ground. Bucky was drunk and delirious, and he was talking about hearing birds singing. Sister listened; she could only hear the keening of wind past the mouth of the cave. \"Dear God, please guide my hand,\" Hugh whispered. He picked up a knife. The blade was too wide, and he chose another. Even the narrowest of the available knives would be as clumsy as a broken thumb. He knew that one slip could cut into the boy\u0027s left ventricle, and then nothing could stop the geyser of blood. \"Go on,\" Robin urged. \"I\u0027ll start when I\u0027m ready! Not one damned second before! Now move away from me, boy!\" Robin retreated but stayed close enough to watch. Some of the others were holding Bucky\u0027s arms, head and body to the ground, and most of them - even the Job\u0027s Mask victims - had crowded around. Hugh looked at the knife in his hand; it was shaking, and there was no stopping it. Before his nerve broke entirely, he leaned forward and pressed the hot blade against an edge of the wound. Infectious fluids spattered. Bucky\u0027s body jackknifed, and the boy howled with agony. \"Hold him down!\" Hugh shouted. \"Hold him, damn it!\" The boys struggled to control him, and even Paul had trouble with the kicking legs. Hugh\u0027s knife dug deeper, Bucky\u0027s cry reverberating off the walls. Robin shouted, \"You\u0027re killing him!\" but Hugh paid no heed. He picked up the moonshine jug and splashed alcohol in and around the oozing wound. Now the boys could barely hold Bucky down. Hugh began to probe again, his own heart pounding as if about to burst through his breast. \"I can\u0027t see the bullet!\" Hugh said. \"It\u0027s gone too deep!\" Blood was welling up, thick and dark red. He plucked away bone chips from a nicked rib. The red, spongy mass of the lung hitched and bubbled beneath the blade. \"Hold him down, for God\u0027s sake!\" he shouted. The blade was too wide; it was not a surgical instrument, it was a butchering tool. \"I can\u0027t do it! I can\u0027t!\" he wailed, and he flung the knife away. Robin pressed the pistol\u0027s barrel to his skull. \"Get it out of him!\" \"I don\u0027t have the proper instruments! I can\u0027t work without - \" \"Fuck the instruments!\" Robin shouted. \"Use your fingers, if you have to! Just get the bullet out!\" Bucky was moaning, his eyelids fluttering wildly, and his body kept wanting to curl into fetal a position. It took all the strength of the others to restrain him. Hugh was distraught; the metal pot held no blades narrow enough for the work. Robin\u0027s pistol pushed at his head. He looked to one side and saw the circle of glass on the ground. He saw the two thin spikes, and noted where three more had been broken away. \"Sister, I need one of those spikes as a probe,\" he said. \"Could you break one off for mei\" She hesitated only a second or two, and then the spike was in his palm and aflame with color. Spreading the wound\u0027s edges with his other hand, he slid the spike into the scarlet hole. Hugh had to go deep, his spine crawling at the thought of what the probe might be grazing. \"Hold him!\" he warned, angling the piece of glass a centimeter to the left. The heart was laboring, the body passing another threshold of shock. Hurry! Hurry! Hugh thought. Find the bastard and get out! Deeper slid the probe, and still no bullet. He imagined suddenly that the glass was getting warm in his hand - very warm. almost hot. another two seconds, and he was certain: The probe was heating up. Bucky shuddered, his eyes rolled back in his head and he mercifully passed out. a wisp of steam came from the wound like an exhaled breath. Hugh thought he smelled scorching tissue. \"Sisteri I don\u0027t... know what\u0027s happening, but I think - \" The probe touched a solid object deep in the spongy folds of tissue, less than a half inch below the left coronary artery. \"Found it!\" Hugh croaked as he concentrated on determining its size with the end of the probe. Blood was everywhere, but it wasn\u0027t the bright red of an artery, and its movement was sluggish. The glass was hot in his grip, the smell of scorching flesh stronger. Hugh realized that his remaining leg and the lower half of his body were freezing cold, but steam was rising from the wound; it occurred to him that the piece of glass was somehow channeling his body heat, drawing it up and intensifying it down in the depths of the hole. Hugh felt power in his hand - a calm, magnificent power. It seemed to crackle up his arm like a bolt of lightning, clearing his brain of fear and burning away the moonshine cobwebs. Suddenly his thirty years of medical knowledge flooded back into him, and he felt young and strong and unafraid. He didn\u0027t know what that power was - the surge of life itself, or something that people used to call salvation in the churches - but he could see again. He could bring that bullet out. Yes. He could. His hands were no longer shaking. He realized he would have to dig down beneath the bullet and lever it up with the probe until he could get two fingers around it. The left coronary artery and the left ventricle were close, very close. He began to work with movements as precise as geometry. \"Careful,\" Sister cautioned, but she knew she didn\u0027t have to warn him. His face was bent over the wound, and suddenly he shouted, \"More light!\" and Robin brought a candle closer. The bullet came loose from the surrounding tissue. Hugh heard a sizzling noise, smelled burning flesh and blood. What the hell... i he thought, but he had no time to let his concentration wander. The glass spike was almost too hot to hold now, though he dared not release it. He felt as if he were sitting in a deep freeze up to his chest. \"I see it!\" Hugh said. \"Small bullet, thank God!\" He pushed two fingers into the wound and caught the bit of lead between them. He brought them out again, clenching what resembled a broken filling for a tooth, and tossed it to Robin. Then he started withdrawing the probe, and all of them could hear the sizzling of flesh and blood. Hugh couldn\u0027t believe what he was witnessing; down in the wound, torn tissue was being cauterized and sealed up as the spike emerged. It came out like a wand of white-hot fire. as it left the wound there was a quick hissing and the blood congealed, the infected edges rippling with blue fire that burned for four of Sister\u0027s rapid heartbeats and went out. Where a hole had been a few seconds before was now a brown, charred circle. Hugh held the piece of glass before his face, his features washed with pure white light. He could feel the heat, yet the hottest of the healing fire was concentrated right at the tip. He realized it had cauterized the tiny vessels and ripped flesh like a surgical laser. The probe\u0027s inner flame began to weaken and go out. as the light steadily waned Sister saw that the jewels within it had turned to small ebony pebbles, and the interconnecting threads of precious metals had become lines of ash. The light continued to weaken until finally there was just a spark of white fire at the tip; it pulsed with the beat of Hugh\u0027s heart - once, twice and a third time - and winked out like a dead star. Bucky was still breathing. Hugh, his face streaked with sweat and a bloody mist, looked up at Robin. He started to speak, couldn\u0027t find his voice. His lower body was warming up again. \"I guess this means,\" he finally said, \"that you won\u0027t be killing us todayi\" Fifty-seven Josh nudged Swan. \"You doing okayi\" \"Yes.\" She lifted her misshapen head from the folds of her coat. \"I\u0027m not dead yet.\" \"Just checking. You\u0027ve been pretty quiet all day.\" \"I\u0027ve been thinking.\" \"Oh.\" He watched as Killer ran ahead along the road, then stopped and barked for them to catch up. Mule was walking as fast as he was going to go, and Josh held the reins loosely. Rusty trudged alongside the wagon, all but buried in his cowboy hat and heavy coat. The Travelin\u0027 Show wagon creaked on, the road bordered by dense forest. The clouds seemed to be hanging right in the treetops, and the wind had all but stopped - a merciful and rare occurrence. Josh knew the weather was unpredictable - there could be a blizzard and a thunderstorm the same day, and the next day calm winds could whirl into tornadoes. For the past two days, they\u0027d seen nothing living. They\u0027d come upon a broken-down bridge and had to detour several miles to get back to the main road; a little further on, that road was blocked by a fallen tree, so another detour had to be found. But today they\u0027d passed a tree about three miles back with TO MaRY\u0027S REST painted on its trunk, and Josh had breathed easier. at least they were headed in the right direction, and Mary\u0027s Rest couldn\u0027t be much further. \"Mind if I ask what you\u0027re thinking abouti\" Josh prodded. She shrugged her thin shoulders beneath the coat and didn\u0027t reply. \"The tree,\" he said. \"It\u0027s that, isn\u0027t iti\" \"Yes.\" The apple blossoms blowing in the snow and stumps continued to haunt her - life amid death. \"I\u0027ve been thinking about it a lot.\" \"I don\u0027t know how you did it, but...\" He shook his head. The rules of the world have changed, he thought. Now the mysteries hold sway. He listened to the creaking axles and the crunch of snow under Mule\u0027s hooves for a moment, and then he had to ask it: \"What did... what did it feel likei\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" another shrug. \"Yes, you do. You don\u0027t have to be shy about it. You did a wonderful thing, and I\u0027d like to know what it felt like.\" She was silent. Up ahead about fifteen yards, Killer barked a few times. Swan heard the barking as a call that the way was clear, \"It felt... like I was a fountain,\" she replied. \"and the tree was drinking. It felt like I was fire, too, and for a minute\" - she lifted her deformed face toward the heavy sky - \"I thought I could look up and remember what it was like to see the stars, way up in the dark... like promises. That\u0027s what it felt like.\" Josh knew that what Swan had experienced was far beyond his senses; but he could fathom what she meant about the stars. He hadn\u0027t seen them for seven years. at night there was just a vast darkness, as if even the lamps of Heaven had burned out. \"Was Mr. Moody righti\" Swan asked. \"Right about whati\" \"He said that if I could wake up one tree, I could start orchards and crop fields growing again. He said... I\u0027ve got the power of life inside me. Was he righti\" Josh didn\u0027t answer. He recalled something else Sly Moody had said: \"Mister, that Swan could wake the whole land up again!\" \"I was always good at growing plants and flowers,\" Swan continued. \"When I wanted a sick plant to get better, I worked the dirt with my hands, and more often than not the brown leaves fell off and grew back green. But I\u0027ve never tried to heal a tree before. I mean... it was one thing to grow a garden, but trees take care of themselves.\" She angled her head so she could see Josh. \"What if I could grow the orchards and crops back againi What if Mr. Moody was right, and there\u0027s something in me that could wake things up and start them growingi\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Josh said. \"I guess that would make you a pretty popular lady. But like I say, one tree isn\u0027t an orchard.\" He shifted uncomfortably on the hard board beneath him. Talking about this made him jittery. Protect the child, he thought. If Swan could indeed spark life from the dead earth, then could that awesome power be the reason for PawPaw\u0027s commandmenti In the distance, Killer barked again. Swan tensed; the sound was different, faster and higher pitched. There was a warning in that bark. \"Stop the wagon,\" she said. \"Huhi\" \"Stop the wagon.\" The strength of her voice made Josh pull Mule\u0027s reins. Rusty stopped, too, the lower half of his face shielded with a woolen muffler under the cowboy hat. \"Hey! What\u0027re we stoppin\u0027 fori\" Swan listened to Killer\u0027s barking, the noise floating around a bend in the road ahead. Mule shifted in his traces, lifted his head to sniff the air and made a deep grumbling sound. another warning, Swan thought; Mule was smelling the same danger Killer had already sensed. She tilted her head to see the road. Everything looked okay, but the vision blurred in and out in her remaining eye and she knew its sight was rapidly failing. \"What is iti\" Josh asked. \"I don\u0027t know. Whatever it is, Killer doesn\u0027t like it.\" \"Could be the town\u0027s just around the bend!\" Rusty said. \"I\u0027ll mosey ahead and find out!\" His hands thrust into his coat pockets, he started walking toward the bend in the road. Killer was still barking frantically. \"Rusty! Wait!\" Swan called, but her voice was so garbled he didn\u0027t understand her and kept going at a brisk pace. Josh realized that Rusty wasn\u0027t carrying a gun, and no telling what was around that bend. \"Rusty!\" he shouted, but the other man was already taking the curve. \"Oh, shit!\" Josh unzipped the wagon\u0027s flap, then opened the shoe box with the .38 in it and hastily loaded it. He could hear Killer\u0027s yap-yap-yapping echoing through the woods, and he knew that Rusty would find out what Killer had seen in just a matter of seconds. around the bend, Rusty was faced with nothing but more road and woods. Killer was standing in the center of the road about thirty feet away, barking wildly at something off to the right. The terrier\u0027s coat was bristling. \"What the hell\u0027s bit your butti\" Rusty asked, and Killer ran between his legs, almost tripping him. \"Crazy fool dog!\" He reached down to pick the terrier up - and that was when he smelled it. a sharp, rank odor. He recognized it. The heady spoor of a wild animal. There was a nerve-shattering shriek, almost in his ear, and a gray form shot from the forest\u0027s edge. He didn\u0027t see what it was, but he flung an arm up over his face to protect his eyes. The animal slammed into his shoulder, and for an instant Rusty felt entangled by live wires and thorns. He staggered back, trying to cry out, but the breath had been knocked from his lungs. His hat spun away, spattered with blood, and he sank to his knees. Dazed, he saw what had hit him. Crouched about six feet away, its spine arched, was a bobcat almost the size of a calf. The thing\u0027s extended claws looked like hooked daggers, but what shocked Rusty almost senseless was the sight of the monster\u0027s two heads. While one green-eyed face shrieked with a noise like razor blades on glass, the second bared its fangs and hissed like a radiator about to blow. Rusty tried to crawl away. His body refused. Something was wrong with his right arm, and blood was streaming down the right side of his face. Bleedin\u0027! he thought. I\u0027m bleedin\u0027 bad! Oh, Jesus, I\u0027m - The bobcat came at him like a spring unwinding, its claws and double set of fangs ready to rip him to pieces. But it was hit in mid-air by another form, and Killer almost took one of the monster\u0027s ears off. They landed in a clawing, shrieking fury, hair and blood flying. But the battle was over in another instant as the massive bobcat twisted Killer on his back and one of the fanged mouths tore the terrier\u0027s throat open. Rusty tried to get to his feet, staggered and fell again. The bobcat turned toward him. One set of fangs snapped at him while the other head sniffed the air. Rusty got a booted foot up in the air to kick at the monster when it attacked. The bobcat crouched back on its hind legs. Come on! Rusty thought. Get it over with, you two-headed bas - He heard the crack! of a pistol, and snow jumped about six feet behind the bobcat. The monster whirled around, and Rusty saw Josh running toward him. Josh stopped, took aim again and fired. The bullet went wild again, and now the bobcat began to turn one way and then the other, as if its two brains couldn\u0027t agree on which way to run. The heads snapped at each other, straining at the neck. Josh planted his feet, aimed with his single eye and squeezed the trigger. a hole plowed through the bobcat\u0027s side, and one head made a shrill wailing while the second growled at Josh in defiance. He fired again and missed, but he hit with his next two shots. The monster trembled, loped toward the woods, turned and streaked again toward Rusty. The eyes of one head had rolled back to show the whites, but the other was still alive, and its fangs were bared to plunge into Rusty\u0027s throat. He heard himself screaming as the monster advanced, but less than three feet from him the bobcat shuddered and its legs gave way. It fell to the road, its living head snapping at the air. Rusty scrambled away from the thing, and then a terrible wave of weakness crashed over him. He lay where he was as Josh ran toward him. Kneeling beside Rusty, Josh saw that the right side of his face had been clawed open from hairline to jaw, and in the torn sleeve of his right shoulder was mangled tissue. \"Bought the farm, Josh.\" Rusty summoned a weak smile. \"Sure did, didn\u0027t Ii\" \"Hang on.\" Josh tucked the pistol under one arm and lifted Rusty off the ground, slinging him over his back in a fireman\u0027s carry. Swan was approaching, trying to run but being thrown off balance by the weight of her head. a few feet away, the mutant bobcat\u0027s fangs came together like the crack of a steel trap; the body shook, and then its eyes rolled back like ghastly green marbles. Josh walked past the bobcat to Killer and the terrier\u0027s pink tongue emerged from its bloody mouth to lick Josh\u0027s boot. \"What happenedi\" Swan called frantically. \"What is iti\" Killer made an effort to rise to all fours when he heard Swan\u0027s voice, but his body was beyond control. His head was hanging limply, and as Killer toppled back on his side Josh could see that the dog\u0027s eyes were already glazing over. \"Joshi\" Swan called. Her hands were up in front of her, because she could hardly see where she was going. \"Talk to me, damn it!\" Killer gave one quick gasp, and then he was gone. Josh stepped between Swan and the dog. \"Rusty\u0027s been hurt,\" he said. \"It was a bobcat. We\u0027ve got to get him to town in a hurry!\" He grasped her arm and pulled her with him before she could see the dead terrier. Josh gently laid Rusty in the back of the wagon and covered him with the red blanket. Rusty was shivering and only half conscious. Josh told Swan to stay with him, and then he went forward and took Mule\u0027s reins. \"Giddap!\" he shouted. The old horse, whether surprised by the command or by the unaccustomed urgency of the reins, snorted steam through his nostrils and bounded forward, pulling with new-found strength. Swan drew the tent\u0027s flap open. \"What about Killeri We can\u0027t just leave him!\" He couldn\u0027t yet bring himself to tell her that the terrier was dead. \"Don\u0027t you worry,\" he said. \"He\u0027ll find his way.\" He snapped the reins against Mule\u0027s haunches. \"Giddap now, Mule! Go, boy!\" The wagon rounded the bend, its wheels passing on either side of Killer, and Mule\u0027s hooves threw up a spray of snow as the horse raced toward Mary\u0027s Rest. Fifty-eight The road spooled out another mile before the woods gave way to bleak, rolling land that might have once been plowed hillsides. Now it was a snow-covered waste, interrupted by black trees twisted into shapes both agonized and surrealistic. But there was a town, of sorts: Clustered along both sides of the road were maybe three hundred weather-beaten clapboard shacks. Josh thought that seven years ago a sight like this would\u0027ve meant he was entering a ghetto, but now he was overjoyed to the point of tears. Muddy alleys cut between the shacks, and smoke curled into the bitter air from stovepipe chimneys. Lanterns glowed behind windows insulated with yellowed newspapers and magazine pages. Skinny dogs howled and barked around Mule\u0027s legs as Josh drew the wagon up amid the shacks. across the road and up a ways was a charred pile of timbers where one of the buildings of Mary\u0027s Rest had burned to the ground; the fire had been some time ago, because new snow had collected in the ruins. \"Hey!\" Josh shouted. \"Somebody help us!\" a few thin children in ragged coats came out from the alleys to see what was going on. \"Is there a doctor around herei\" Josh asked them, but they scattered back into the alleys. The door of a nearby shack opened, and a black-bearded face peered cautiously out. \"We need a doctor!\" Josh demanded. The bearded man shook his head and shut the door. Josh urged Mule deeper into the shantytown. He kept shouting for a doctor, and a few people opened their doors and watched him pass, but none offered assistance. Further on, a pack of dogs that had been tearing at the remains of an animal in the mud snarled and snapped at Mule, but the old horse kept his nerve and held steady. From a doorway lurched an emaciated old man in rags, his face blotched with red keloids. \"No room here! No food! We don\u0027t want no strangers here!\" he raved, striking the wagon\u0027s side with a gnarled stick. He was still babbling as they drew away. Josh had seen a lot of wretched places before, but this was the worst. It occurred to him that this was a town of strangers where nobody gave a shit about who lived or died in the next hovel. There was a brooding sense of defeat and fatal depression here, and even the air smelled of rank decay. If Rusty hadn\u0027t been so badly hurt, Josh would have kept the wagon going right through the ulcer of Mary\u0027s Rest and out where the air smelled halfway decent again. a figure with a malformed head stumbled along the roadside, and Josh recognized the same disease that both he and Swan had. He called to the person, but whoever it was - male or female - turned and ran down an alley out of sight. Lying on the ground a few yards away was a dead man, stripped naked, his ribs showing and his teeth bared in what might have been a grin of escape. a few dogs were sniffing around him, but they had not yet begun feasting. and then Mule stopped as if he\u0027d run into a brick wall, neighed shrilly and almost reared. \"Whoa! Settle down, now!\" Josh shouted, having to fight the horse for control. He saw that someone was in the road in front of them. The figure was wearing a faded denim jacket and a green cap and was sitting in a child\u0027s red wagon. The figure had no legs, the trousers rolled up and empty below the thighs. \"Hey!\" Josh called. \"Is there a doctor in this towni\" The face turned slowly toward him. It was a man with a scraggly light brown beard and vague, tormented eyes. \"We need a doctor!\" Josh said. \"Can you help usi\" Josh thought the man might\u0027ve smiled, but he wasn\u0027t sure. The man said, \"Welcome!\" \"a doctor! Can\u0027t you understand mei\" \"Welcome!\" the man repeated, and he laughed, and Josh realized he was out of his mind. The man reached out, plunged his hands into the mud and began to pull himself and the wagon across the road. \"Welcome!\" he shouted as he rolled away into an alley. Josh shivered, and not just from the cold. That man\u0027s eyes... they were the most awful eyes Josh had ever looked into. He got Mule settled down and moving forward again. He continued to shout for help. an occasional face looked out from a doorway and then drew quickly back. Rusty\u0027s going to die, Josh feared. He\u0027s going to bleed to death, and not a single bastard in this hellhole will raise a finger to save him! Yellow smoke drifted across the road, the wagon\u0027s tires moving through puddles of human waste. \"Somebody help us!\" Josh\u0027s voice was giving out. \"Please... for God\u0027s sake... somebody help us!\" \"Lawd! What\u0027s all the yellin\u0027 abouti\" Startled, Josh looked toward the voice. Standing in the doorway of a decrepit shack was a black woman with long, iron-gray hair. She wore a coat that had been stitched from a hundred different scraps of cloth. \"I need to find a doctor! Can you help mei\" \"What\u0027s wrong with youi\" Her eyes, the color of copper pennies, narrowed. \"Typhoidi The dysenteryi\" \"No. My friend\u0027s been hurt. He\u0027s in the back.\" \"ain\u0027t no doctor in Mary\u0027s Rest. Doctor died of typhoid. ain\u0027t nobody can help you.\" \"He\u0027s bleeding bad! Isn\u0027t there someplace I can take himi\" \"You can take him to the Pit,\" she suggested. She had a sharp-featured, regal face. \"\u0027Bout a mile or so down the road. It\u0027s where all the bodies go.\" The dark face of a boy about seven or eight years old peeked through the doorway at her side, and she rested a hand on his shoulder. \"ain\u0027t noplace to take him but there.\" \"Rusty\u0027s not dead, lady!\" Josh snapped. \"But he\u0027s sure going to be if I don\u0027t find some help for him!\" He flicked Mule\u0027s reins. The black woman let him get a few yards further down the road, and then she said, \"Hold on!\" Josh reined Mule in. The woman walked down the cinder block steps in front of her shack and approached the rear of the wagon while the little boy nervously watched. \"Open this thing up!\" she said - and suddenly the rear flap was unzipped, and she was face to face with Swan. The woman stepped back a pace, then took a deep breath, summoned her courage again and looked into the wagon at the bloody white man lying under a red blanket. The white man wasn\u0027t moving. \"He still alivei\" she asked the faceless figure. \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" Swan replied. \"But he\u0027s not breathing very good.\" She could make out the \"yes,\" but nothing more. \"What happenedi\" \"Bobcat got him,\" Josh said, coming around to the back of the wagon. He was shaking so much he could hardly stand. The woman took a long, hard look at him with her piercing copper-colored eyes. \"Damned thing had two heads.\" \"Yeah. Lots of \u0027em out in the woods like that. Kill you for sure.\" She glanced toward the house, then back at Rusty. He made a soft moaning noise, and she could see the terrible wound on the side of his face. She let the breath leak out between her clenched teeth. \"Well, bring him on inside, then.\" \"Can you help himi\" \"We\u0027ll find out.\" She started walking toward the shack and turned back to say, \"I\u0027m a seamstress. Pretty good with a needle and catgut. Bring him on.\" The shack was as grim inside as it was out, but the woman had two lanterns lit, and on the walls were hung bright pieces of cloth. at the center of the front room stood a makeshift stove constructed from parts of a washing machine, a refrigerator and various pieces of what might have been a truck or car. a few scraps of wood burned behind a grate that was once a car\u0027s radiator grille, and the stove only provided heat within a two or three foot radius. Smoke leaked through the funnel that went up into the roof, giving the shack\u0027s interior a yellow haze. The woman\u0027s furniture - a table and two chairs - were crudely sawn from worm-eaten pinewood. Old newspapers covered the windows, and the wind piped through cracks in the walls. On the pinewood table were snippets of cloth, scissors, needles and the like, and a basket held more pieces of cloth in a variety of colors and patterns. \"It ain\u0027t much,\" she said with a shrug, \"but it\u0027s better than some has. Bring him in here.\" She motioned Josh into a second, smaller room, where there was an iron-framed cot and a mattress stuffed with newspapers and rags. On the floor next to the cot was a little arrangement of rags, a small patchwork pillow and a thin blanket in which, Josh presumed, the little boy slept. In the room there were no windows, but a lantern burned with a shiny piece of tin behind it to reflect the light. an oil painting of a black Jesus on a hillside surrounded by sheep hung on a wall. \"Lay him down,\" the woman said. \"Not on my bed, fool. On the floor.\" Josh put Rusty down with his head cradled by the patchwork pillow. \"Get that jacket and sweater off him so I can see if he\u0027s still got any meat left on that arm.\" Josh did as she said while Swan stood in the doorway with her head tilted way to one side so she could see. The little boy stood on the other side of the room, staring at Swan. The woman picked up the lantern and put it on the floor next to Rusty. She whistled softly. \"\u0027Bout scraped him to the bone. aaron, you go bring the other lamps in here. Then you fetch me the long bone needle, the ball of catgut and a sharp pair of scissors. Hurry on, now!\" \"Yes, Mama,\" aaron said, and he darted past Swan. \"What\u0027s your friend\u0027s namei\" \"Rusty.\" \"He\u0027s in a bad way. Don\u0027t know if I can stitch him up, but I\u0027ll do my best. ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 but snow water to clean those wounds with, and you sure as hell don\u0027t want that filthy shit in an open - \" She stopped, looking at Josh\u0027s mottled hands as he took off his gloves. \"You black or whitei\" she asked. \"Does it matter anymorei\" \"Naw. Don\u0027t reckon it does.\" aaron brought the two lanterns, and she arranged them near Rusty\u0027s head while he went out again to get the other things she needed. \"You got a namei\" \"Josh Hutchins. The girl\u0027s name is Swan.\" She nodded. Her long, delicate fingers probed the ragged edges of the wound at Rusty\u0027s shoulder. \"I\u0027m Glory Bowen. Make my livin\u0027 by stitchin\u0027 clothes for people, but I ain\u0027t no doctor. The closest I ever come to doctorin\u0027 was helpin\u0027 a few women have their babies - but I know about sewin\u0027 cloth, dogskin and cowhide, and maybe a person\u0027s skin ain\u0027t too much different.\" Rusty\u0027s body suddenly went rigid; he opened his eyes and tried to sit up, but Josh and Glory Bowen held him down. He struggled for a minute, then seemed to realize where he was and relaxed again. \"Joshi\" he asked. \"Yeah. I\u0027m here.\" \"Bastard got me, didn\u0027t hei Old two-headed bastard of a bobcat. Knocked me right on my ass.\" He blinked, looked up at Glory. \"Who\u0027re youi\" \"I\u0027m the woman you\u0027re gonna de-spise in about three minutes,\" she answered calmly. aaron came in with a thin, sharpened splinter of bone that must have been three inches long, and he laid it in his mother\u0027s palm along with a small, waxy-looking ball of catgut thread and a pair of scissors. Then he retreated to the other side of the room, his eyes moving back and forth between Swan and the others. \"What\u0027re you gonna do to mei\" Rusty made out the bone needle as Glory put the end of the thread through the needle\u0027s eye and tied a tiny knot. \"What\u0027s that fori\" \"You\u0027ll find out soon enough.\" She picked up a rag and wiped the sweat and blood from Rusty\u0027s face. \"Gonna have to do a little sewin\u0027 on you. Gonna put you together just like a fine new shirt. That suit youi\" \"Oh... Lord\" was all Rusty could manage to say. \"We gonna have to tie you down, or are you gonna be a man about thisi Don\u0027t have nothin\u0027 to kill the pain.\" \"Just... talk to me,\" Rusty told her. \"Okayi\" \"Sure. Whatcha wanna talk abouti\" She positioned the needle near the ripped flesh at Rusty\u0027s shoulder. \"How \u0027bout foodi Fried chicken. a big bucketful of Colonel Sanders with them hot spices. That sound good to youi\" She angled the needle in the precise direction she wanted, and then she went to work. \"Can\u0027t you just smell that Kentucky Fried heaveni\" Rusty closed his eyes. \"Yeah,\" he whispered thickly. \"Oh, yeah... I sure can.\" Swan couldn\u0027t bear to watch Rusty in pain. She went to the front room, where she warmed herself by the makeshift stove. aaron peeked around the corner at her, then jerked his head out of sight. She heard Rusty catch his breath, and she went to the door, opened it and stepped outside. She climbed into the back of the wagon to get Crybaby, and then she stood rubbing Mule\u0027s neck. She was worried about Killer. How was he going to find themi and if a bobcat had hurt Rusty that badly, what might one do to Killeri \"Don\u0027t you worry,\" Josh had said. \"He\u0027ll find his way.\" \"You got a haid inside therei\" a small, curious voice asked beside her. Swan made out aaron standing a few feet away.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/swan-song/page-18.html","bookId":2476,"book":{"id":2476,"title":"Swan Song","description":"Storyline: In a wasteland born of rage and fear, populated by monstrous creatures and marauding armies, earth\u0027s last survivors have been drawn into the final battle between good and evil, that will decide the fate of humanity: Sister, who discovers a strange and transformative glass artifact in the destroyed Manhattan streets . . .
