Face it, none of us are way out in front of the game when we\u0027re dealing with Mother Bell.\"\n \"I suppose.\"\n \"So you\u0027ve got free long distance and free Call Forwarding. There\u0027s a code you have to enter to forward your calls, but just ring them up and tell them you lost the slip and they\u0027ll explain it to you. Nothing to it. TJ, what\u0027s your phone number?\"\n \"Ain\u0027t got one.\"\n \"Well, your favorite pay phone.\"\n \"Favorite? I don\u0027t know. Don\u0027t know the number of any of \u0027em, anyhow.\"\n \"Well, pick one out and give me the location.\"\n \"There be a bank of three of \u0027em in Port Authority that I use some.\"\n \"No good. Too many phones there, it\u0027s impossible to know if we\u0027re talking about the same one. How about one on a street corner?\"\n He shrugged. \"Say Eighth and Forty-third.\"\n \"Uptown, downtown?\"\n \"Uptown, east side of the street.\"\n \"Okay, let\u0027s justâ€¦ there, got it. You want to write down the number?\"\n \"Just change it,\" David suggested.\n \"Good idea. Make it an easy one to remember. How about TJ-5-4321?\"\n \"Like it\u0027s my own phone number? Hey, I like that!\"\n \"Let\u0027s just see if it\u0027s available. Nope, somebody\u0027s got it. So why don\u0027t we take the other direction? TJ-5-6789. No problem, so let\u0027s make it all yours. So ordered.\"\n \"You can just do that?\" I wondered. \"Aren\u0027t different three-number prefixes specifically linked to different areas?\"\n \"Used to be. And there\u0027s still exchanges, but that works for the particular line number, and that has nothing to do with what you dial. See, the number you dial, like the one I just gave TJ, is the same as the PIN code you use to get money out of your ATM at the bank. It\u0027s just a recognition code, really.\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s an access code,\" David said. \"But it accesses the line, and that\u0027s what routes the call.\"\n \"Let\u0027s fix the phone for you, TJ. It\u0027s a pay phone, right?\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"Wrong. It was a pay phone. Now it\u0027s a free phone.\"\n \"Just like that?\"\n \"Just like that. Some idiot\u0027ll probably report it in a week or two, but until then you can save yourself a few quarters. Remember when we played Robin Hood?\"\n \"Oh, that was fun,\" David said. \"We were down at the World Trade Center one night making calls from a pay phone, and of course the first thing we did was convert it, make it free-\"\n \"- or otherwise we\u0027d be dropping quarters in all night long, which is pretty ridiculous-\"\n \"- and Hong here says pay phones should be free for everybody, same as the subways ought to be free, they ought to eliminate the turnstiles-\"\n \"- or make them turn with or without a token, which you could do if they were computerized, but they\u0027re mechanical-\"\n \"- which is pretty primitive, when you stop and think about it-\"\n \"- but with pay phones we\u0027re in a position to do something, so for I think it was two hours-\"\n \"- more like an hour and a half-\"\n \"- we\u0027re hopping through COSMOS, or maybe it was MIZAR-\"\n \"- no, it was COSMOS-\"\n \"- and we\u0027re changing one pay phone after another, liberating it, setting it free-\"\n \"- and Hong\u0027s really getting into it, like \u0027Power to the People\u0027 and everything-\"\n \"- and I don\u0027t know how many phones we switched by the time we were done.\" He looked up. \"You know something? Sometimes I can see why NYNEX wants to nail our hides to the wall. If you look at it in a certain way, we\u0027re sort of a major pain in the ass to them.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"So you\u0027ve got to see their point of view, that\u0027s all.\"\n \"No you don\u0027t,\" David King said. \"The last thing you have to do is see their point of view. That\u0027s about as smart as playing PacMan and feeling sorry for the blue meanies.\"\n Jimmy Hong argued the point, and while they kicked it back and forth I cracked a fresh Coke. When I got back where the action was Jimmy said, \"All right, we\u0027re in the Brooklyn circuits. Give me that number again.\"\n I looked it up and read it off and he fed it to the computer. More letters and numbers, meaningless to me, appeared on the screen. His fingers danced on the keys, and my client\u0027s name and address showed up.\n \"That your friend?\" Jimmy wanted to know. I said it was. \"He\u0027s not talking on the phone,\" he said.\n \"You can tell that?\"\n \"Sure. We could listen in if he was. You can just drop in and listen to anybody.\"\n \"Except it\u0027s so boring.\"\n \"Yeah, we used to do it sometimes. You think maybe you\u0027ll hear something hot, or people talking about a crime or spy stuff. But all you really get to hear is this remarkably tedious crap. \u0027Pick up a quart of milk on your way home, darling.\u0027 Really boring.\"\n \"And so many people are so inarticulate. They just stutter and stammer along and you want to tell \u0027em to spit it out or forget about it.\"\n \"Of course there\u0027s always phone sex.\"\n \"Don\u0027t remind me.\"\n \"That\u0027s King\u0027s favorite. Three dollars a minute billed to your home phone, but if you\u0027ve got a pay phone that you taught not to be a pay phone, then it\u0027s free.\"\n \"It feels creepy, though. What we did once, though, we just dropped in and listened on some of those lines.\"\n \"And then cut in and made comments, which really freaked this one guy. He was paying to talk one-on-one to this woman with this incredible voice-\"\n \"- who probably had a face like Godzilla, but nobody could tell-\"\n \"- and here\u0027s King dropping in on him in the middle of a sentence and trashing his fantasy.\"\n \"The girl was freaking, too.\"\n \"Girl, she was probably a grandmother.\"\n \"She\u0027s going like, \u0027Who said that? Where are you? How did you get on this line?\u0027 \"\n Throughout this exchange Jimmy Hong had been participating in another dialogue as well, this one with the computer. Now he held up a hand for silence and hit keys with the other. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Gimme the date. It was in March, right?\"\n \"The twenty-eighth.\"\n \"Month three, date two-eight. And we want calls to 04-053-904.\"\n \"No, his number is-\"\n \"That\u0027s his line number, Matt. Remember the difference? Uh, what I figured. Data not available.\"\n \"What does that mean?\"\n \"Means we were smart to bring in a lot of food. Could somebody bring me some of those Doritos? We\u0027re going to be here awhile, that\u0027s all. You interested in calls he made from his phone, while we\u0027re in this part of the system? Seems a shame to waste it.\"\n \"Might as well.\"\n \"See what we get. Look at that, it doesn\u0027t want to tell me a thing. Okay, let\u0027s try this. Uh-huh. Okay, now-\"\n Then the system began spitting out a record of calls, reeling them off chronologically starting a few minutes after midnight. There were two calls before one in the morning, then nothing until 8:47, when the system logged a thirty-second call to a 212 number. There was one other call in the morning and several in the early afternoon, and none at all between 2:51 and 5:18, when he had been on the phone for a minute and a half with his brother. I recognized Peter Khoury\u0027s number.\n Then nothing else that night.\n \"Anything you want to copy, Matt?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Okay,\" he said. \"Now for the hard part.\"\n I COULDN\u0027T tell you what it was that they did. A little after eleven they switched and David took over the controls, while Jimmy paced the floor and yawned and stretched and went to the bathroom and came back and polished off a package of Hostess cupcakes. At twelve-thirty they switched again and David went into the bathroom and took a shower. By this time TJ was sound asleep on the bed, lying fully clothed on the bedspread, shoes and all, and clutching one of the pillows as if the world were trying to get it away from him.\n At one-thirty Jimmy said, \"God damn it, I can\u0027t believe there\u0027s no way into NPSN.\"\n \"Give me the phone,\" David said. He dialed a number, snarled, broke the connection, dialed again, and on the third try got through to somebody. \"Yo,\" he said. \"Who\u0027m I talkin\u0027 to? Great. Listen, Rita, this is Taylor Fielding at NICNAC Central an\u0027 I got a Code Five emergency coming down. I need your NPSN access code and your password before the whole thing backs up clear to Cleveland. That\u0027s Code Five, did you hear me?\" He listened intently, then reached out a hand for the computer keyboard. \"Rita,\" he said, \"you\u0027re beautiful. You saved my life, no joke. Can you believe I had two people in a row didn\u0027t know a Code Five takes precedence? Yeah, well, that\u0027s \u0027cause you pay attention. Listen, if you get any static on this, I\u0027ll take full responsibility. Yeah, you too. \u0027Bye.\"\n \"You take full responsibility,\" Jimmy said. \"I like that.\"\n \"Well, it seemed only right.\"\n \"What the hell is a Code Five, will you tell me that?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. What\u0027s NICNAC Central? Who\u0027s Taylor Feldman?\"\n \"You said Fielding.\"\n \"Well, it was Feldman before he changed it. I don\u0027t know, man. I just made it all up but it sure impressed Rita.\"\n \"You sounded so desperate.\"\n \"Well, why shouldn\u0027t I be? Half-past one in the morning and we\u0027re not even into NPSN yet.\"\n \"We are now.\"\n \"And how sweet it is. I\u0027ll tell you, Hong, you can\u0027t beat that Code Five. It really cuts through all the bureaucratic bullshit, you know what I mean. \u0027I got a Code Five emergency coming down.\u0027 Man, that just about blew her doors off.\"\n \" \u0027Rita, you\u0027re beautiful.\u0027 \"\n \"Man, I was falling in love, I have to say it. And by the time we were through we\u0027d sort of established a relationship, you know?\"\n \"You gonna call her again?\"\n \"I bet I can get a password off her anytime, unless something tips her that she just gave away the store. Otherwise next time I call her we\u0027re gonna be old friends.\"\n \"Call her sometime,\" I said, \"and don\u0027t try to get a password or an access code or anything else.\"\n \"You mean just ring her up to chat?\"\n \"That\u0027s the idea. Maybe give her some information, but don\u0027t try to get anything out of her.\"\n \"Far out,\" David said.\n \"And then later on-\"\n \"Got it,\" Jimmy said. \"Matt, I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve got either the digital dexterity or the hand-eye coordination, and you don\u0027t really know a thing about the technology, but I have to tell you something. You\u0027ve got the heart and soul of a hacker.\"\n ACCORDING to the Kongs, the whole process really got interesting after they got into NPSN, whatever that meant. \"This is the part that\u0027s fascinating from a technical standpoint,\" David explained, \"because here\u0027s where we try retrieving information the NYNEX people claimed wasn\u0027t available. They\u0027ll say that just to brush you off, but some of them were telling the truth, or what they thought was the truth, because the fact of the matter is they wouldn\u0027t know how to go about finding it. So it\u0027s almost as though we have to invent our own program and feed it into their system so it\u0027ll spit out the data we want.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-22.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: \n A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
