{"id":63752,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\"Yeah, you\u0027re right. They live a mile and a half from me and I\u0027m trying to have them chase into Manhattan in order to hear about me. Of course when I said what I said I didn\u0027t know they were from Brooklyn.\"\n \"When you said what?\"\n He looked at me, the pain stitched into his forehead. \"When I told Petey he ought to stop running his mouth about my business at his meetings. When I said maybe that\u0027s how they got onto me, that\u0027s how they picked Francine.\" He turned to look out the window at the laundromat. \"It was when he drove me to the airport. It was just a flare-up. He was giving me grief about something, I forget what, and I threw that in his face. He looked for a second as though I just kicked him in the pit of the stomach. Then he said something, you know, indicating it washed right over him, that he wasn\u0027t going to take it seriously, he knew I was just spouting out of anger.\"\n He turned the key in the ignition. \"Fuck this laundry,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t see a lot of people lining up to make phone calls. Let\u0027s get out of here, huh?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n And, a block or two farther along: \"Suppose he kept mulling it over, brooding on it. Suppose it stayed on his mind. Suppose he wondered if it was true.\" He darted a glance at me. \"You think that\u0027s what sent him out looking to cop? \u0027Cause I\u0027ll tell you, if I was Petey, that just might do it.\"\n BACK in Manhattan he said, \"I want to go by his place, knock on his door. You want to keep me company?\"\n The lock wasn\u0027t working on the rooming-house door. Kenan drew it open and said, \"Great security here. Great place altogether.\" We entered and climbed two flights of stairs through that flophouse smell of mice and soiled linen. Kenan walked to a door and listened for a moment, knocked on it, called out his brother\u0027s name. There was no response. He repeated the process with the same result, tried the door and found it locked.\n \"I\u0027m afraid what I\u0027ll find in there,\" he said, \"and at the same time I\u0027m afraid to walk away.\"\n I found an expired Visa card in my wallet and loided the door with it. Kenan glanced at me with new respect.\n The room was empty, and a mess. The bed linen was half on the floor, and clothing was piled in disarray on a wooden chair. I spotted the Big Book and a couple of AA pamphlets on the oak bureau. I didn\u0027t see any bottles or drug paraphernalia, but there was a water tumbler on the bedside table and Kenan picked it up and sniffed at it.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"What do you think?\"\n The glass was dry inside, but I thought I could smell a residue of alcohol. Still, suggestion would account for it. It wouldn\u0027t be the first time I\u0027d smelled alcohol when there wasn\u0027t any there.\n \"I don\u0027t like poking around his things,\" Kenan said. \"What little he\u0027s got, he\u0027s entitled to his privacy. I just had this vision of him turning blue with the needle still in his arm, you know what I mean?\"\n Out on the street he said, \"Well, he\u0027s got money. He won\u0027t have to steal. \u0027Less he gets into cocaine, that\u0027ll take whatever you got, but he never liked coke much. Petey likes the bass notes, likes to get down as deep as you can go.\"\n \"I can identify with that.\"\n \"Yeah. He runs out of dough, he can always sell Francey\u0027s Camry. He hasn\u0027t got the title, but it Blue Books at eight or nine grand, so he can probably find somebody\u0027ll give him a few hundred for it without papers. That\u0027s junkie economics, makes perfect sense.\"\n I told him Peter\u0027s joke about the difference between a drunk and a junkie. They\u0027d both steal your wallet, but the junkie would help you look for it.\n \"Yeah,\" he said, nodding. \"Says it all.\"\n Chapter 17\n Several things happened over the course of the next week or so.\n I made three trips to Sunset Park, two of them alone, the third in the company of TJ. At loose ends one afternoon, I beeped him and got a call back almost immediately. We met in the Times Square subway station and rode out to Brooklyn together. We had lunch at a deli and caf–π con leche at the Cuban place and walked around some. We talked a lot, and while I didn\u0027t learn a great deal about him, he learned a few things about me, assuming he was listening.\n While we waited for our train back to the city he said, \"Say, you don\u0027t have to pay me nothin\u0027 for today. On account of we didn\u0027t do nothin\u0027.\"\n \"Your time has to be worth something.\"\n \"If I be workin\u0027, but all I was doin\u0027 was hangin\u0027 around. Man, I been doin\u0027 that for free all my life.\"\n Another night I was just about to leave the house and head for a meeting when a call from Danny Boy sent me chasing out to an Italian restaurant in Corona, where three small-time louts had recently blossomed as big spenders. It seemed unlikely- Corona is in northern Queens, and light-years from Sunset Park- but I went anyway and drank San Pellegrino water at the bar and waited for three guys in silk suits to come in and throw their money around.\n The TV was on, and at ten o\u0027clock the Channel 5 newscast included a shot of three men who\u0027d just been arrested for the recent robbing and pistol-whipping of a Forty-seventh Street diamond merchant. The bartender said, \"Hey, would you look at that! Those assholes were in here the past three nights, spending money like they couldn\u0027t get rid of it fast enough. I had a kind of a feeling where it came from.\"\n \"They made it the old-fashioned way,\" the man next to me said. \"They stole it.\"\n I was only a few blocks from Shea Stadium, but that still left me hundreds of miles from the Mets, who had lost a close one to the Cubs that afternoon at Wrigley. The Yankees were at home against the Indians. I walked to the subway and went home.\n ANOTHER time I got a call from Drew Kaplan, who said that Kelly and his colleagues at Brooklyn Homicide wanted Pam to go down to Washington and pay a call at the FBI\u0027s National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime at Quantico. I asked when she was going.\n \"She\u0027s not,\" he said.\n \"She refused?\"\n \"At her attorney\u0027s suggestion.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" I said. \"The public-relations department was always where the Feebies were strongest, but what I\u0027ve heard about their division that profiles serial killers is fairly impressive. I think she should go.\"\n \"Well,\" he said, \"it\u0027s too bad you\u0027re not her lawyer. It\u0027s her interests I\u0027ve been engaged to protect, my friend. Anyway, the mountain\u0027s coming to Mohammed. They\u0027re sending a guy up tomorrow.\"\n \"Let me know how it goes,\" I said, \"insofar as that coincides with what you deem to be the best interests of your client.\"\n He laughed. \"Don\u0027t get hinky, Matt. Why should she have to schlep down to DC? Let him come here.\"\n After the meeting with the profiler he called again to say he was not blown away by the session. \"He seemed a little nonchalant to me,\" Drew said. \"Like someone who\u0027s only killed two women and slashed a third isn\u0027t worth his time. I gather the more of a string a killer puts together, the more it gives them to work with.\"\n \"That figures.\"\n \"Yeah, but it\u0027s small consolation to the people at the end of the string. They\u0027d probably just as soon the cops caught the guy early on instead of letting him provide such interesting items for their data base. He was telling Kelly they\u0027ve put together a really solid profile of some yutz out on the West Coast. They could tell you he collected stamps as a boy and how old he was when he got his first tattoo. But they still haven\u0027t apprehended the son of a bitch and I think he said the current count is forty-two, with four more probables.\"\n \"I can see why Ray and his friend seem small-time.\"\n \"He wasn\u0027t wild about the frequency, either. He said serial killers generally manifest a higher level of activity. That means they don\u0027t wait months between crimes. He said either they hadn\u0027t hit their stride yet or they were infrequent visitors to New York and did the bulk of their killing elsewhere.\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"They know the city too well for that.\"\n \"Why do you say that?\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"How do you know how well they knew the city?\"\n Because they had sent the Khourys chasing all over Brooklyn, but I couldn\u0027t mention that. \"They used two different outer-borough cemeteries for dumping grounds,\" I said, \"and Forest Park. Who did you ever hear of from out of town who could pick up a girl on Lexington Avenue and wind up in a cemetery in Queens?\"\n \"Anybody could,\" he said, \"if he picked up the wrong girl. Let me think what else he said. He said they were probably in their early thirties, probably abused as children. He came up with a lot of very general stuff. There was one other thing he said that gave me a chill.\"\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\n \"Well, this particular guy\u0027s been with the division twenty years, just about since they started it up. He\u0027s coming up on retirement pretty soon and he said he\u0027s just as glad.\"\n \"Because he\u0027s burned out?\"\n \"More than that. He said the rate at which these incidents are occurring has been increasing all along in a really nasty way. But the way the curve\u0027s shaping up now, they think these cases are really going to spike between now and the end of the century. Sport-killing, he called it. Says they\u0027re looking for it to be the leisure craze of the nineties.\"\n THEY didn\u0027t do this when I first came around, but these days at AA meetings they generally invite newcomers with less than ninety days of sobriety to introduce themselves and give their day count. At most meetings each of these announcements gets a round of applause. Not at St. Paul\u0027s, though, because of a former member who came every night for two months and said before each meeting, \"My name is Kevin and I\u0027m an alcoholic and I\u0027ve got one day back. I drank last night but I\u0027m sober today!\" People got sick of applauding this statement, and at the next business meeting we voted, after much debate, to drop the applause altogether. \"My name is Al,\" someone will say, \"and I\u0027ve got eleven days.\" \"Hi, Al,\" we say.\n It was a Wednesday when I walked from Brooklyn Heights clear out to Bay Ridge and collected my expense money from Kenan Khoury, and it was the following Tuesday at the eight-thirty meeting when a familiar voice at the back of the room said, \"My name is Peter and I\u0027m an alcoholic and a drug addict and I\u0027ve got two days back.\"\n \"Hi, Peter,\" everybody said.\n I had planned to catch up with him during the break but I got caught up in a conversation with the woman sitting next to me, and when I turned to look for him he was gone. I called him from the hotel afterward but he didn\u0027t answer. I called his brother\u0027s house.\n \"Peter\u0027s sober,\" I said. \"At least he was an hour ago. I saw him at a meeting.\"\n \"I spoke to him earlier today. He said he had most of my money left and nothing bad happened to the car. I told him I didn\u0027t give a shit about the money or the car, I cared about him, and he said he was all right. How\u0027d he look to you?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t see him. I just heard him speak up, and when I went to look for him he was gone. I just called to let you know he was alive.\"\n He said he appreciated it. Two nights later Kenan called and said he was downstairs in the lobby. \"I\u0027m double-parked out front,\" he said. \"You had dinner yet? C\u0027mon downstairs, meet me outside.\"\n In the car he said, \"You know Manhattan better than I do. Where do you want to go? Pick a place.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-32.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: \n A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
