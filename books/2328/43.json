{"id":63768,"no":43,"title":"Page 43","content":"I called out to Yuri, told him to call her. \"Luschka!\" he cried. \"Luschka, it\u0027s Papa. Come to Papa!\" She recognized the voice. Her brow contracted in concentration, as if she was struggling to make sense out of the syllables. I said, \"In Russian, Yuri!\" He replied with something that I certainly couldn\u0027t understand, but it evidently got through to Lucia. Her hands unclasped and she took a step, then another. I said, \"What\u0027s the matter with her hand?\" \"Nothing.\" As she drew alongside me I reached for her hand. She snatched it away from me. There were two fingers missing. I stared at Callander. He looked almost apologetic. \"Before we set the terms,\" he said, by way of explanation. There was another burst of Russian from Yuri, and now she was moving faster, but hardly running. She couldn\u0027t seem to manage more than an awkward shuffle, and I wasn\u0027t sure how long she could sustain even that much. But she stayed on her feet and kept going, and I stayed on mine and looked into the barrels of two handguns. The dark man stared silently at me, still a study in rage, while Callander watched the girl. He kept the gun pointed at me but he couldn\u0027t keep his eyes from turning to her, and I could feel how much he wanted to swing the gun, too, in her direction. \"I liked her,\" he said. \"She was nice.\" THE rest of it was easy. I opened the second suitcase and stepped back a few paces. Ray came forward to inspect the contents of both cases while his partner kept me covered. The bills got only a cursory examination. He flipped through half a dozen packs, but he didn\u0027t count any of them, or make a rough count of the number of packets. Nor did he spot the counterfeits, but I don\u0027t think anybody on earth would have. He closed the cases and fastened their clasps, then drew his gun again and stood aside while the dark-haired man came to pick up both of them, grunting with the effort. It was the first sound he had made in my presence. \"Take one at a time,\" Callander said. \"They ain\u0027t heavy.\" \"Take one at a time.\" \"Don\u0027t tell me what to do, Ray,\" he said, but he put down one of the suitcases and went off with the other. He wasn\u0027t gone long, and neither Ray nor I spoke in his absence. When he got back he hefted the second case and pronounced it lighter than its fellow, as if this meant we\u0027d cheated him on the count. \"Then it should be easier to carry,\" Callander said patiently. \"Go ahead now.\" \"We oughta plug this cocksucker, Ray.\" \"Another time.\" \"Fucking dope-dealing cop. Oughta blow his head off.\" When he had gone Callander said, \"You promised us a week. Will you keep your word on that?\" \"Longer if I can.\" \"I\u0027m sorry about the finger.\" \"Fingers.\" \"As you prefer. He\u0027s difficult to control.\" I thought, But you were the one who used the wire on Pam. \"I appreciate the week\u0027s lead time,\" he went on. \"I think it\u0027s time to try a change of climate. I don\u0027t think Albert will want to come with me.\" \"You\u0027ll leave him here in New York?\" \"In a manner of speaking.\" \"How did you find him?\" He smiled faintly at the question. \"Oh,\" he said, \"we found each other. People with specialized tastes often find each other like that.\" It was an odd moment. I had the sense that I was talking to the person behind the mask, that our circumstances had provided a rare window of opportunity. I said, \"May I ask you something?\" \"Go ahead.\" \"Why the women?\" \"Oh, my. Take a psychiatrist to answer that, wouldn\u0027t it? Something buried in my childhood, I suppose. Isn\u0027t that what it always turns out to be? Weaned too early or too late?\" \"That\u0027s not what I meant.\" \"Oh?\" \"I don\u0027t care how you got that way. I just want to know why you do it.\" \"You think I have a choice?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Do you?\" \"Hmmm. That\u0027s not so easy to answer. Excitement, power, just sheer intensity- words fail me. Do you know what I mean?\" \"No.\" \"Have you ever been on a roller coaster? Now I hate roller coasters, I haven\u0027t been on one in years, I get sick to my stomach. But if I didn\u0027t hate roller coasters, if I loved them, then that\u0027s what it would be like.\" He shrugged. \"I told you. Words fail me.\" \"You don\u0027t sound like a monster.\" \"Why should I?\" \"What you do is monstrous. But you sound like a human being. How can you-\" \"Yes?\" \"How can you do it?\" \"Oh,\" he said. \"They\u0027re not real.\" \"What?\" \"They\u0027re not real,\" he said. \"The women. They aren\u0027t real. They\u0027re toys, that\u0027s all. When you have a hamburger are you eating a cow? Of course not. You\u0027re eating a hamburger.\" A slight smile. \"Walking down the street she\u0027s a woman. But once she gets in the truck that\u0027s over. She\u0027s just body parts.\" A chill ran the length of my spine. When that happened my late aunt Peg used to say a goose must have just walked over my grave. A funny expression, that. I wonder where it came from. \"But do I have a choice? I think I do. It\u0027s not as though I\u0027m driven to act out every time the moon is full. I always have a choice, and I can choose not to do anything, and I do choose not to, and then one day I choose the other way. \"So what kind of choice is it, really? I can postpone it, but then the time comes when I don\u0027t want to postpone it any longer. And postponing just makes it sweeter, anyway. Maybe that\u0027s why I do it. I read that maturity consists of the ability to defer gratification, but I don\u0027t know if this is what they had in mind.\" He looked to be on the point of further revelation, and then something shifted within him and the window of opportunity slammed shut. Whatever real self I\u0027d been talking to ducked back behind its protective body armor. \"Why aren\u0027t you afraid?\" he asked, petulant. \"I\u0027ve got a gun on you and you act like it\u0027s a water pistol.\" \"There\u0027s a high-powered rifle trained on you. You wouldn\u0027t get a step.\" \"No, but what good would it do you? You\u0027d think you would be scared. Are you a brave man?\" \"No.\" \"Well, I\u0027m not going to shoot. And let Albert keep everything? No, I don\u0027t think so. But I think it\u0027s time for me to melt into the shadows. Turn around, start walking back toward your friends.\" \"All right.\" \"There\u0027s no third man with a rifle. Did you think there was?\" \"I wasn\u0027t sure.\" \"You knew there wasn\u0027t. That\u0027s all right. You got the girl and we got the money. It all worked out.\" \"Yes.\" \"Don\u0027t try to follow me.\" \"I won\u0027t.\" \"No, I know you won\u0027t.\" He didn\u0027t say anything more, and I thought he had slipped away. I kept walking, and when I\u0027d gone a dozen steps he called after me. \"I\u0027m sorry about the fingers,\" he said. \"It was an accident.\" Chapter 22 \"You quiet,\" TJ said. I was driving Kenan\u0027s Buick. As soon as Lucia Landau had reached her father\u0027s side, he had scooped her up in his arms and slung her over his shoulder and hurried back to his car, with Dani and Pavel taking off after him. \"I told him not to wait around,\" Kenan had said. \"Kid needed a doctor. He\u0027s got somebody lives in the neighborhood, guy\u0027ll come to the house.\" So that had left two cars for the four of us, and when we reached them Kenan tossed me the Buick\u0027s keys and said he would ride with his brother. \"Come on out to Bay Ridge,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll send out for pizza or something. Then I\u0027ll run you two home.\" We were stopped at a traffic light when TJ told me I was quiet, and I couldn\u0027t argue with that. Neither of us had said a word since we got in the car. I still hadn\u0027t shaken off the effect of the conversation with Callander. I said something to the effect that our activities had taken a lot out of me. \"You was cool, though,\" he said. \"Standin\u0027 up there with those dudes.\" \"Where were you? We thought you were back at the car.\" He shook his head. \"I circled around \u0027em. Thought maybe I could see this third man, one with the rifle.\" \"There wasn\u0027t any third man.\" \"Sure made him hard to see. What I did, I made a big circle around \u0027em and slipped out the place they came in. I found their car.\" \"How did you manage that?\" \"Wasn\u0027t hard. I seen it before, it was the same Honda again. I backed up against a pole an\u0027 kept an eye on it an\u0027 the dude without no jacket came hurrying out of the graveyard an\u0027 threw a suitcase in the trunk. Then he turned around an\u0027 ran back in again.\" \"He was going back for the other suitcase.\" \"I know, an\u0027 I thought while he\u0027s gettin\u0027 the second suitcase, I could just take the first one off his hands. Trunk was locked, but I could open it same way he did, pressin\u0027 the release button in the glove compartment. \u0027Cause the car doors wasn\u0027t locked.\" \"I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t try.\" \"Well, I coulda done it, but say he come back and the suitcase ain\u0027t there, what he gonna do? Go back and shoot you, most likely. So I figured that wasn\u0027t too cool.\" \"Good thinking.\" \"Then I thought, if this here\u0027s a movie, what I do is slip in the back an\u0027 hunker down \u0027tween the front an\u0027 back seats. They be puttin\u0027 the money in the trunk an\u0027 sittin\u0027 up front, so they ain\u0027t even gone look in the back. Figured they go back to their house, or wherever they gone go, an\u0027 when we got there I just slip out an\u0027 call you up an\u0027 tell you where I\u0027m at. But then I thought, TJ, this ain\u0027t no movie, an\u0027 you too young to die.\" \"I\u0027m glad you figured that out.\" \" \u0027Sides, maybe you don\u0027t be at that same number, an\u0027 then what do I do? So I wait, and he come back with the second suitcase, throw it in the trunk, an\u0027 get in the car. An\u0027 the other one, one who made the phone call, he come an\u0027 get behind the wheel. And they drive off, an\u0027 I slip back into the cemetery an\u0027 catch up with everybody. Cemetery\u0027s weird, man. I can see havin\u0027 a stone, tells who\u0027s underneath it, but some of \u0027em has these little houses an\u0027 all, fancier than they had when they alive. Would you want somethin\u0027 like that?\" \"No.\" \"Me neither. Just a little stone, don\u0027t say nothin\u0027 on it, but TJ.\" \"No dates? No full name?\" He shook his head. \"Just TJ,\" he said. \"An\u0027 maybe my beeper number.\" BACK on Colonial Road, Kenan got on the phone and tried to find a pizza place that was still open. He couldn\u0027t, but it didn\u0027t matter. Nobody was hungry. \"We ought to be celebrating,\" he said. \"We got the kid back, she\u0027s alive. Some celebration we got here.\" \"It\u0027s a draw,\" Peter said. \"You don\u0027t celebrate a tie score. Nobody wins and nobody shoots off firecrackers. Game ends in a tie, it feels worse than losing.\" \"It\u0027d feel a lot worse if the girl was dead,\" Kenan said. \"That\u0027s because this isn\u0027t a football game, it\u0027s real. But you still can\u0027t celebrate, babe. The bad guys got away with the money. Does that makes you want to toss your hat in the air?\" \"They\u0027re not in the clear,\" I put in. \"It\u0027ll take a day or two, that\u0027s all. But they\u0027re not going anywhere.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-43.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
