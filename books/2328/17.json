Told you that, didn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"More than once.\"\\n\\n \"What I did, I call the operator. Say, \u0027Hey, girl, somebody screwed up, ain\u0027t no number here on the phone, so how do I know where I callin\u0027 from?\u0027 An\u0027 she say how she got no way to tell what the number is of the phone I\u0027m at, so she can\u0027t help me.\"\\n\\n \"That seems unlikely.\"\\n\\n \"Thought so myself. Thought they got all that equipment, you ask them a number at Information an\u0027 they can say it about as fast as you can ask it, so how come they can\u0027t give you the number of your own phone? An\u0027 I thought, TJ, you fool, they took out the numbers to fuck up dope dealers, an\u0027 here you go soundin\u0027 just like one. So I dial 0 again, on account of you can call the operator all day long an\u0027 never spend no quarter, it a free call. An\u0027 you know you get somebody different every time you call. So I got some other chick, an\u0027 this time I took all the street out of my voice, I said, \u0027Perhaps you can help me, miss. I\u0027m at a pay phone and I have to leave the number with my office for a call back, and someone defaced the phone with spray-painted graffiti in such a way that the number is impossible to make out. I wonder if you could possibly check the line and supply it for me.\u0027 An\u0027 I ain\u0027t even through sayin\u0027 it when she\u0027s readin\u0027 off the number for me. Matt? Oh, shit.\"\\n\\n The recording had cut in to ask for more money.\\n\\n \"Quarter ran out,\" he said. \"I got to feed in another one.\"\\n\\n \"Give me the number, I\u0027ll call you.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t. I ain\u0027t in Brooklyn now, I didn\u0027t happen to con nobody out of the number for this particular phone.\" The phone chimed as his coin dropped. \"There, we be all right now. Pretty slick, though, way I got the other number. You there? How come you ain\u0027t sayin\u0027 nothing\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m stunned,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t know you could talk like that.\"\\n\\n \"What, you mean talk straight? \u0027Course I can. Just because I street don\u0027t mean I be ignorant. They two different languages, man, and you talkin\u0027 to a cat\u0027s bilingual.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m impressed.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah? I figured you\u0027d be impressed I got to Brooklyn an\u0027 back. What you got for me to do next?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing right now.\"\\n\\n \"Nothin\u0027? Sheee, ought to be something I can do. I did good on this, didn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"You did great.\"\\n\\n \"I mean, man didn\u0027t have to be a rocket scientist to find his way to Brooklyn an\u0027 back. But it was cool how I got the number out of that operator, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Definitely.\"\\n\\n \"I was bein\u0027 resourceful.\"\\n\\n \"Very resourceful.\"\\n\\n \"But you still ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 for me today.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid not,\" I said. \"Check with me in a day or two.\"\\n\\n \"Check with you,\" he said. \"Man, I\u0027d check with you anytime you say if only you was there to be checked with. You know who oughta have a beeper? Man, you oughta have a beeper. I could beep you, you\u0027d say to yourself, \u0027Must be TJ tryin\u0027 to get hold of me, must be important.\u0027 What\u0027s so funny?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing.\"\\n\\n \"Then how come you laughin\u0027? I be checkin\u0027 with you every day, my man, because I think you need me workin\u0027 for you. An\u0027 that is final, Lionel.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, I like that.\"\\n\\n \"Thought you would,\" he said. \"Been savin\u0027 it up for you.\"\\n\\n IT rained all day Sunday and I spent most of the day in my room. I had the TV on and switched back and forth between tennis on ESPN and golf on one of the networks. There are days when I can get caught up in a tennis match but this wasn\u0027t one of them. I can never get caught up in golf, but the scenery is pretty and the announcers aren\u0027t as relentlessly chatty as they are in most other sports, so it\u0027s not a bad thing to have going on while I sit thinking about something else.\\n\\n Jim Faber called in the middle of the afternoon to cancel our standing dinner date. A cousin of his wife\u0027s had died and they had to go put in an appearance. \"We could meet someplace now for a cup of coffee,\" he said, \"except it\u0027s such a lousy day outside.\"\\n\\n We spent ten minutes on the phone instead. I mentioned that I was a little worried about Peter Khoury, that he might pick up a drink or a drug. \"The way he talked about heroin,\" I said, \"he had me wanting some myself.\"\\n\\n \"I noticed that about junkies,\" he said. \"They get this wistful quality, like an old man talking about his lost youth. You know you can\u0027t keep him sober.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not sponsoring him, are you?\"\\n\\n \"No, but neither is anybody else. And last night he was using me like a sponsor.\"\\n\\n \"Be just as well if he didn\u0027t formally ask you to be his sponsor. You\u0027ve already got a professional relationship with his brother, and to an extent with him.\"\\n\\n \"I thought of that.\"\\n\\n \"But even if he did, that still doesn\u0027t make him your responsibility. You know what constitutes being a successful sponsor? Staying sober yourself.\"\\n\\n \"It seems to me I\u0027ve heard that.\"\\n\\n \"From me, probably. But nobody can keep anybody else sober. I\u0027m your sponsor. Do I keep you sober?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"I stay sober in spite of you.\"\\n\\n \"In spite of me or to spite me?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe a little of both.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s Peter\u0027s problem, anyway? Feeling sorry for himself because he can\u0027t drink or shoot up?\"\\n\\n \"Snort.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"He stayed away from needles. But yeah, that\u0027s most of it. And he\u0027s pissed off at God.\"\\n\\n \"Shit, who isn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"Because what kind of a God would let something like that happen to a wonderful person like his sister-in-law?\"\\n\\n \"God pulls that kind of shit all the time.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"And maybe he had a reason. Maybe Jesus wants her for a sunbeam. Remember that song?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I ever heard it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I hope to God you never hear it from me, because I\u0027d have to be drunk to sing it. Do you figure he was fucking her?\"\\n\\n \"Do I figure who was fucking who?\"\\n\\n \"Whom. Do you figure Peter was fucking the sister-in-law?\"\\n\\n \"Jesus,\" I said. \"Why would I think that? You\u0027ve got a hell of a mind, you know that?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the people I hang around with.\"\\n\\n \"It must be. No, I don\u0027t think he was. I think he\u0027s just feeling sad, and I think he wants to drink and take dope, and I hope he doesn\u0027t. That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n I called Elaine and told her I was free for dinner, but she\u0027d already made arrangements for her friend Monica to come over. She said they were going to order Chinese food in, and I was welcome to come over, that way they could order more dishes. I said I would pass.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re afraid it\u0027ll be an evening of girl talk,\" she said. \"And you\u0027re probably right.\"\\n\\n Mick Ballou called while I was watching 60 Minutes and we talked for ten or twelve of them. I told him in the same breath that I had booked a trip to Ireland and that I\u0027d had to cancel it. He was sorry I wasn\u0027t coming over but glad I\u0027d found something to keep me busy.\\n\\n I told him a little about what I was doing, but not the sort of person I was working for. He had no sympathy for drug dealers, and occasionally supplemented his income by invading their homes and taking their cash.\\n\\n He asked about the weather and I said it had been raining all day. He said it was always raining there, that he was finding it hard to recall what the sun looked like. Oh, and had I heard? They\u0027d come up with evidence that Our Lord was Irish.\\n\\n \"Is that so?\"\\n\\n \"It is,\" he said. \"Consider the facts. He lived with his parents until He was twenty-nine years old. He went out drinking with the lads the last night of His life. He thought His mother was a virgin, and herself, a good woman, she thought He was God.\"\\n\\n THE week started slowly. I hammered away at the Khoury case, if you want to call it that. I managed to get the name of one of the officers who\u0027d caught the Leila Alvarez homicide. She was the Brooklyn College student who\u0027d been dumped in GreenWood Cemetery, and the case belonged not to the Seventy-second Precinct but to Brooklyn Homicide. A Detective John Kelly had headed the investigation, but I had trouble reaching him and was reluctant to leave a name and number.\\n\\n I saw Elaine Monday and she was disappointed that her phone hadn\u0027t been ringing off the hook with calls from rape victims. I told her she might not get any response, that it was like that sometimes, that you had to throw a lot of baited hooks in the water and sometimes you went a long time without a bite. And it was early, I said. It was unlikely the people she spoke to would have made any calls until the weekend was over.\\n\\n \"It was over today,\" she reminded me. I said if they did make calls it might take them a while to reach people, and it might take the victims a couple of days to make up their minds to call.\\n\\n \"Or not to call,\" she said.\\n\\n She was more discouraged when Tuesday passed without a call. When I spoke to her Wednesday evening she was excited. The good news was that three women had called her. The bad news was that none of the calls looked to have anything to do with the men who had killed Francine Khoury.\\n\\n One was a woman who had been ambushed by a solitary assailant in the hallway of her apartment house. He had raped her and stolen her purse. Another had accepted a ride home from school with someone she took to be another student; he had shown her a knife and ordered her into the backseat, but she had been able to escape.\\n\\n \"He was a skinny kid and he was alone,\" Elaine said, \"so I thought it was stretching it to figure him as a possibility. And the third call was date rape. Or pickup rape, I don\u0027t know what you\u0027d call it. According to her, she and her girlfriend picked up these two guys in a bar in Sunnyside. They went for a ride in the guys\u0027 car and her girlfriend got carsick so they stopped the car so she could get out and vomit. And then they drove off and left her there. Can you believe that?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s not very considerate,\" I said, \"but I don\u0027t think I\u0027d call it rape.\"\\n\\n \"Funny. Anyway, they drove around for a while and then they went back to her house and they wanted to have sex with her, and she said nothing doing, what kind of a girl do you think I am, blah blah blah, and finally she agreed that she\u0027d fuck one of them, the one she\u0027d been more or less partnered with, and the other one would wait in the living room. Except he didn\u0027t, he walked in while they were getting it on and watched, which did little to cool his ardor, as you might have figured.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And afterward he said please please please, and she said no no no, and finally she gave him a blow-job because that was the only way to get rid of him.\"\\n\\n \"She told you this?\"\\n\\n \"In more ladylike terms, but yeah, that\u0027s what happened. Then she brushed her teeth and called the cops.\"\\n\\n \"And reported it as rape?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027d be willing to call it that. It escalated from please please please to Get me off or I\u0027ll kick your teeth down your throat, so I\u0027d say that qualifies as rape.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sure, if it was that forceful.\"\\n\\n \"But it doesn\u0027t sound like our guys.\"\\n\\n \"No, not at all.\"\\n\\n \"I got their numbers just in case you want to follow up on them, and I told them we\u0027d call if the producer decided to pursue it, that the whole project was kind of iffy just now. Was that right?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-17.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \\n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
