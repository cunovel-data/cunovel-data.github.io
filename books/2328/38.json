{"id":63763,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"I found his beeper number in my notebook, but before I could dial it the phone rang, and it was TJ. \"Man was just here,\" he said. He sounded excited. \"Just on this phone.\" \"It must have been someone else.\" \"No chance, Vance. Mean dude, you look at him an\u0027 you know you seein\u0027 evil. Wasn\u0027t you just talkin\u0027 to him? I got this flash, said my man Matt is talkin\u0027 to this dude.\" \"I was, but I got off the phone with him at least ten minutes ago. Maybe closer to fifteen.\" \"Yeah, be about right.\" \"I thought you\u0027d call right away.\" \"I couldn\u0027t, man. I had to follow the dude.\" \"You followed him?\" \"What you think I do, run away when I see him comin\u0027? I don\u0027t walk out arm in arm with the man, but he walk out an\u0027 I give him a minute an\u0027 I slip out after him.\" \"That\u0027s dangerous TJ. The man\u0027s a killer.\" \"Man, am I supposed to be impressed? I\u0027m on the Deuce \u0027bout every day of my life. Can\u0027t walk down that street without you\u0027re followin\u0027 some killer or other.\" \"Where did he go?\" \"Turned left, walked to the corner.\" \"Forty-ninth Street.\" \"Then walked across to the deli on the other side of the avenue. Went inside, stayed a minute or two, came out again. Don\u0027t guess he had them make him a sandwich on account of he wasn\u0027t in there that long. Could of picked up a six-pack. Package he carried was about that size.\" \"Then where did he go?\" \"Back the way he came. Sucker walked right past me, crossed Fifth again, and he\u0027s headin\u0027 straight back for the laundry. I thought, shit, can\u0027t follow him back in there, have to hang around outside until he makes his call.\" \"He didn\u0027t call here again.\" \"Didn\u0027t call nowhere, \u0027cause he didn\u0027t go inside the laundry. Got in his car an\u0027 drove off. Didn\u0027t even know he had a car until he got into it. It was parked just the other side of the laundry, where you couldn\u0027t see it if you were sittin\u0027 where I was.\" \"A car or a truck?\" \"Said a car. I tried to stay with it but there wasn\u0027t no way. I was layin\u0027 half a block back, not wantin\u0027 to tag him too close on his way back to the laundry, and he was in the car an\u0027 outta there before I could do nothin\u0027. Time I could get to the corner he was around it an\u0027 out of sight.\" \"But you got a good look at him.\" \"Him? Yeah, I saw him.\" \"You could recognize him again?\" \"Man, could you recognize yo\u0027 mama? Kind of a question is that? Man is five-eleven, one hundred seventy pounds, real light brown hair, has eyeglasses with brown plastic frames. Wearin\u0027 black leather lace-up shoes an\u0027 navy pants and a blue zip-up jacket. An\u0027 about the lamest sport shirt you ever saw. Blue an\u0027 white checks. Could I recognize him? Man, if I could draw I\u0027da drawed him. You put me with that artist you was tellin\u0027 me about, we\u0027d wind up with somethin\u0027 looked more like him than a photograph.\" \"I\u0027m impressed.\" \"Yeah? Car was a Honda Civic, sort of a blue-gray, a little beat up. Up until he got into it I figured I\u0027d follow him right back to where he\u0027s stayin\u0027. He snatched somebody, right?\" \"Yes.\" \"Who?\" \"A fourteen-year-old girl.\" \"Motherfucker,\" he said. \"I knowed that, maybe I tag him a little closer, run a little faster.\" \"You did fine.\" \"What I think I do now, I check out the neighborhood some. Maybe I see where he park his car.\" \"If you\u0027re sure you\u0027d recognize it.\" \"Well, I got the plate number. Be a lot of Hondas, but not too many got the same license plate.\" He read it out to me and I jotted it down and started to tell him how pleased I was with his performance. He didn\u0027t let me finish. \"Man,\" he said, exasperated, \"how long we gonna go on this way, with you bein\u0027 stone amazed every time I do somethin\u0027 right?\" \"IT\u0027S going to take us a few hours to get the money together,\" I told him when he called again. \"It\u0027s more than he has and it\u0027s going to be difficult to raise it at this hour.\" \"You\u0027re not trying to lower the price, are you?\" \"No, but if you want the whole amount you\u0027ll have to be patient.\" \"How much do you have now?\" \"I don\u0027t have a count.\" \"I\u0027ll call in an hour,\" he said. \"YOU can use this phone,\" I told Yuri. \"He won\u0027t be calling for the next hour. How much have we got?\" \"A little over four,\" Kenan said. \"Less than half.\" \"Not enough.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"One way to look at it, who else are they gonna sell her to? If you tell him this is all we got, take it or leave it, what\u0027s he gonna do?\" \"The trouble is you don\u0027t know what he\u0027s likely to do.\" \"Yeah, I keep forgetting he\u0027s a lunatic.\" \"He wants a reason to kill the girl.\" I didn\u0027t want to stress this in front of Yuri, but it had to be said. \"That\u0027s what got them started in the first place. They like killing. She\u0027s alive, and he\u0027ll keep her alive as long a she\u0027s their ticket to the money, but he\u0027ll kill her the minute he thinks he can get away with it, or that he\u0027s lost his shot at the money. I don\u0027t want to tell him we\u0027ve only got half a mil. I\u0027d rather show up with half a mil and tell him it\u0027s the whole thing, and hope he doesn\u0027t count it until we\u0027ve got the girl back.\" Kenan thought about this. \"The trouble is,\" he said, \"the cocksucker already knows what four hundred thousand looks like.\" \"See if you can raise some more,\" I said, and went off to use the Snoopy phone. THERE used to be a number you called at the Department of Motor Vehicles. You gave your shield number and told them the plate you wanted to trace and somebody looked it up and read it off to you. I no longer knew that special number, and had a feeling it had long since been phased out. Nobody answered the listed number for DMV. I called Durkin but he wasn\u0027t at the station house. Kelly wasn\u0027t at his desk, either, and there was no point in paging him, because he couldn\u0027t do what I wanted him to do from a distance. I remembered when I\u0027d been in to pick up the Gotteskind file from Durkin and pictured Bellamy at the adjacent desk, having a one-sided conversation with his computer terminal. I called Midtown North and got him. \"Matt Scudder,\" I said. \"Oh, hey,\" he said. \"How you doing? Joe\u0027s not around, I\u0027m afraid.\" \"That\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"Maybe you can do me a favor. I was riding around with a friend of mine and some son of a bitch in a Honda Civic clipped her fender and just plain took off. Most flagrant thing you ever saw.\" \"Damn. And you were in the car when it happened? Man\u0027s a fool, leaving the scene of an accident. Most likely drunk or on drugs.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t be surprised. The thing is-\" \"You got the plate? I\u0027ll run it for you.\" \"I\u0027d really appreciate it.\" \"Hey, nothing to it. I just ask the computer. Hang on.\" I waited. \"Damn,\" he said. \"Something the matter?\" \"Well, they changed the damn password for getting into the DMV data bank. I enter like you\u0027re supposed to and it won\u0027t let me in. Keeps saying back \u0027Invalid Password.\u0027 If you call tomorrow I\u0027m sure-\" \"I\u0027d love to move on this tonight. Before he gets a chance to sober up, if you follow me.\" \"Oh, definitely. If I could help you-\" \"Isn\u0027t there someone you can call?\" \u0027Yeah,\" he said with feeling. \"That bitch down in Records, but she\u0027ll tell me she can\u0027t give it out. I get that crap from her all the time.\" \"Tell her it\u0027s a Code Five emergency.\" \"Say that again?\" \"Just tell her it\u0027s a Code Five emergency,\" I said, \"and she\u0027d better give you the password before you wind up with circuits backed up all the way to Cleveland.\" \"Never heard that before,\" he said. \"Hang on, I\u0027ll give it a shot.\" He put me on Hold. Across the room, Michael Jackson peeked at me through the fingers of his white glove. Bellamy came back on the line and said, \"Damn if it didn\u0027t work. \u0027Code Five emergency.\u0027 Cut right through the bullshit. She came up with the password. Lemme enter it. There you go. Now what was that license number?\" I gave it to him. \"Let\u0027s just see what we get. Okay, didn\u0027t take long. Vehicle is a Eighty-eight Honda Civic two-door, color is pewterâ€¦ Pewter? Man, why can\u0027t they say gray? But you don\u0027t care about that. Owner is- you got a pencil? Callander, Raymond Joseph.\" He spelled the last name. \"Address is Thirty-four Penelope Avenue. That\u0027s in Queens, but where in Queens? You ever hear of Penelope Avenue?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Man, I live in Queens, and it\u0027s a new one on me. Wait, here\u0027s the zip. One-one-three-seven-nine. That\u0027s Middle Village, innit? Never heard of no Penelope Avenue.\" \"I\u0027ll find it.\" \"Yeah, well, I guess you\u0027re motivated, aren\u0027t you? Hope nobody in the car was hurt.\" \"No, just a little body damage.\" \"Nail him good, leaving the scene like that. Other hand, you report it and your friend\u0027s insurance rates go up. Best thing might be if you and him can work something out private, but that\u0027s probably what you got in mind, huh?\" He chuckled. \"Code Five,\" he said. \"Man, that really lit a fire under that girl. I owe you for that.\" \"My pleasure.\" \"No, I really mean it. I run into problems with this thing all the time. That\u0027s gonna save me a lot of major headaches.\" \"Well, if you really figure you owe me-\" \"Go ahead.\" \"I just wondered if he had a sheet, our Mr. Callander.\" \"Now that\u0027s easy to check. Don\u0027t have to call a Code Five \u0027cause I happen to know that entry code. Hang on now. Nope.\" \"Nothing?\" \"Far as the state of New York is concerned, he\u0027s a Boy Scout. Code Five. What\u0027s it mean, anyway?\" \"Let\u0027s just say it\u0027s high level.\" \"I guess.\" \"If you get a hard time,\" I heard myself say, \"just tell them they\u0027re supposed to know that a Code Five supersedes and countermands their standing instructions.\" \"Supersedes and countermands?\" \"That\u0027s it.\" \"Supersedes and countermands their standing instructions.\" \"You got it. But don\u0027t use it on routine matters.\" \"God no,\" he said. \"Wouldn\u0027t want to wear it out.\" FOR a moment there I\u0027d thought we had a bead on him. I had a name now, and an address, but it wasn\u0027t the address I wanted. They were somewhere in Sunset Park, in Brooklyn. The address was somewhere in Middle Village, in Queens. I called Queens Information and dialed the number given to me. The phone made that sound they\u0027ve developed, somewhere between a tone and a squawk, and a recording told me the number I had reached was no longer in service. I called information again and reported this, and the operator checked and told me that the termination of service was recent and the listing had not been deleted yet. I asked if there was a new number. She said there was not. I asked if she could tell me when service had been terminated and she said she couldn\u0027t.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-38.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
