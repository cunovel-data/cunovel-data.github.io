He was smiling hugely, while she was not smiling, as I think I mentioned earlier. She was beaming, though, and you could see that she was radiant with happiness.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what to say.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what they did to her,\" he said. \"That\u0027s one of the things I won\u0027t let myself think about. But they killed her and they butchered her, they made some kind of dirty joke out of her, and I have to do something about it because I\u0027ll die if I don\u0027t. I\u0027d do it all myself if I could. In fact we tried, me and Petey, but we don\u0027t know what to do, we don\u0027t have the knowledge, we don\u0027t know the moves. The questions you asked before, the approach you took, if nothing else it showed me that this is an area where I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing. So I want your help and I can pay you whatever I have to, money\u0027s not a problem, I\u0027ve got plenty of money and I\u0027ll spend whatever I have to. And if you say no I\u0027ll either find someone else or try to do it myself because what the hell else am I gonna do?\" He reached across the table and took the picture away from me and looked at it. \"Jesus, what a perfect day that was,\" he said, \"and all the days since, and then it all turned to shit.\" He looked at me. He said, \"Yes, I\u0027m a trafficker, a dope dealer, whatever you want to call it, and yes, it\u0027s my intention to kill these fucks. So that\u0027s all out on the table. What do you say? Are you in or out?\"\\n\\n My best friend, the man I\u0027d planned to join in Ireland, was a career criminal. According to legend, he had one night walked the streets of Hell\u0027s Kitchen carrying a bowler\u0027s bag from which he displayed the severed head of an enemy. I couldn\u0027t swear it happened, but more recently I\u0027d been at his side in a cellar in Maspeth when he severed a man\u0027s hand with one blow of a cleaver. I\u0027d had a gun in my hand that night, and I\u0027d used it.\\n\\n So if I was still very much a cop in some respects, in other ways I had undergone considerable change. I\u0027d long since swallowed the camel; why strain at the gnat?\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in,\" I said.\\n\\n Chapter 3\\n\\n I got back to my hotel a little after nine. I\u0027d had a long session with Kenan Khoury, filling pages of my notebook with names of friends and associates and family members. I\u0027d gone to the garage to inspect the Toyota, and found the Beethoven cassette still in the tape deck. If there were any other clues in Francine\u0027s car, I couldn\u0027t spot them.\\n\\n The other car, the gray Tempo used to deliver her segmented remains, was not available for inspection. The kidnappers had parked it illegally, and sometime in the course of the weekend a tow truck from Traffic had showed up to haul it away. I could have attempted to track it down, but what was the point? It had surely been stolen for the occasion, and had probably been previously abandoned, given the condition of it. A police lab crew might have turned up something in the trunk or interior, stains or fibers or markings of some sort, that would point out a profitable line of investigation. But I didn\u0027t have the resources for that kind of inspection. I\u0027d be running all over Brooklyn to look at a car that wouldn\u0027t tell me a thing.\\n\\n In the Buick the three of us traced a long, circuitous course, past the D\u0027Agostino\u0027s and the Arabian market on Atlantic Avenue, then south to the first pay phone at Ocean and Farragut, then south on Flatbush and east on N to the second booth on Veterans Avenue. I didn\u0027t really have to see these sights, there\u0027s not a tremendous amount of information you can glean by staring at a public telephone, but I\u0027ve always found it worthwhile to put in time on the scene, to walk the pavements and climb the stairs and see it all firsthand. It helps make it real.\\n\\n It also gave me a way to take the Khourys through it again. In a police investigation, witnesses almost always complain about having to relate the same story over and over to a host of different people. It seems pointless to them, but there\u0027s a point to it. If you tell it enough times to enough different people, maybe you\u0027ll come up with something you\u0027ve previously left out, or maybe one person will hear something that sailed past everybody else.\\n\\n Somewhere in the course of things we stopped at the Apollo, a coffee shop on Flatbush. We all ordered the souv-laki. It was good, but Kenan hardly touched his. In the car afterward he said, \"I should have ordered eggs or something. Ever since the other night I got no taste for meat. I can\u0027t eat it, it turns my stomach. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll get over it, but for the time being I\u0027ve got to remember to order something else. It makes no sense, ordering something and then you can\u0027t bring yourself to eat it.\"\\n\\n PETER drove me home in the Camry. He was staying at Colonial Road, he\u0027d been there since the kidnapping, sleeping on the couch in the living room, and he needed to stop by his room to pick up clothes.\\n\\n Otherwise I\u0027d have called a livery service and taken a taxi. I\u0027m comfortable enough on the subway, I rarely feel unsafe on it, but it seemed a false economy to stint on cab fare with ten thousand dollars in my pocket. I\u0027d have felt pretty silly if I ran into a mugger.\\n\\n That was my retainer, two banded stacks of hundreds with fifty bills in each, two packets of bills indistinguishable from the eighty packets paid to ransom Francine Khoury. I\u0027ve always had trouble putting a price on my services, but in this case I\u0027d been spared the decision. Kenan had dropped the two stacks on the table and asked if that was enough to start with. I told him it was on the high side.\\n\\n \"I can afford it,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got plenty of money. They didn\u0027t tap me out, they didn\u0027t come close.\"\\n\\n \"Could you have paid the million?\"\\n\\n \"Not without leaving the country. I\u0027ve got an account in the Caymans with half a mil in it. I had just under seven hundred large in the safe here. Actually I probably could have raised the other three here in town, if I made a few phone calls. I wonder.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, crazy thinking. Like suppose I paid the mil, would they have returned her alive? Suppose I never pressed on the phone, suppose I was polite, kissed their asses and all.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027d have killed her anyway.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I tell myself, but how do I know? I can\u0027t keep myself from wondering if there was something I could have done. Suppose I played hardball all the way, not a penny paid unless they showed me proof she was alive.\"\\n\\n \"She was probably already dead when they called you.\"\\n\\n \"I pray you\u0027re right,\" he said, \"but I don\u0027t know. I keep thinking there must have been some way I could have saved her. I keep figuring it was my fault.\"\\n\\n WE took expressways back to Manhattan, the Shore Parkway and the Gowanus into the tunnel. Traffic was light at that hour but Pete took it slow, rarely pushing the Camry past forty miles an hour. We didn\u0027t talk much at first, and the silences tended to stretch.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been some couple of days,\" he said finally. I asked him how he was holding up. \"Oh, I\u0027m all right,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Have you been getting to meetings?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m pretty regular.\" After a moment he said, \"I haven\u0027t had a chance to get to a meeting since this shit started. I\u0027ve been, you know, pretty busy.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re no good to your brother unless you stay sober.\"\\n\\n \"I know that.\"\\n\\n \"There are meetings in Bay Ridge. You wouldn\u0027t have to come into the city.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I was gonna go to one last night, but I didn\u0027t get to it.\" His fingers drummed the steering wheel. \"I thought maybe we\u0027d get back in time to get over to St. Paul\u0027s tonight, but we missed it. It\u0027s gonna be way past nine by the time we get there.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a ten o\u0027clock meeting on Houston Street.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"By the time I get to my room, pick up what I need-\"\\n\\n \"If you miss the ten there\u0027s a midnight meeting. Same place, Houston between Sixth and Varick.\"\\n\\n \"I know where it is.\"\\n\\n Something in his tone did not invite further suggestion. After a moment he said, \"I know I shouldn\u0027t let my meetings slide. I\u0027ll try to make the ten o\u0027clock. The midnight, I don\u0027t know about that. I don\u0027t want to leave Kenan alone for that long.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you\u0027ll catch a Brooklyn meeting tomorrow during the day.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\"\\n\\n \"What about your job? You\u0027re letting that slide?\"\\n\\n \"For the time being. I called in sick Friday and today, but if they wind up letting me go it\u0027s no big deal. Job like that\u0027s not hard to come by.\"\\n\\n \"What is it, messenger work?\"\\n\\n \"Delivering lunches, actually. For the deli on Fifty-seventh and Ninth.\"\\n\\n \"It must be hard, working a get-well job like that while your brother\u0027s raking it in.\"\\n\\n He was silent for a moment. Then he said, \"I have to keep all that separate, you know? Kenan wanted me to work for him, with him, whatever you want to call it. I can\u0027t be in that business and stay sober. It\u0027s not that you\u0027re around drugs all the time, because actually you\u0027re not, there\u0027s not that much physical contact with the product. It\u0027s the whole attitude, the mind-set, you know what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"You were right, what you said about meetings. I\u0027ve been wanting to drink ever since I found out about Francey. I mean about her being kidnapped, before they did what they did. I haven\u0027t come close or anything but it\u0027s hard keeping the thought out of my mind. I push it away and it comes right back.\"\\n\\n \"Have you been in touch with your sponsor?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t exactly have one. They gave me an interim sponsor when I first got sober, and I called him fairly regularly at first but we more or less drifted apart. He\u0027s hard to get on the phone, anyway. I should find a regular sponsor, but for some reason I never got around to it.\"\\n\\n \"One of these days-\"\\n\\n \"I know. Do you have a sponsor?\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"We got together just last night. We generally have dinner Sunday, go over the week together.\"\\n\\n \"Does he give you advice?\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes,\" I said. \"And then I go ahead and do what I want.\"\\n\\n WHEN I got back to my hotel room, the first call I made was to Jim Faber. \"I was just talking about you,\" I told him. \"A fellow asked if my sponsor gives advice, and I told him how I always do exactly what you suggest.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re lucky God didn\u0027t strike you dead on the spot.\"\\n\\n \"I know. But I\u0027ve decided not to go to Ireland.\"\\n\\n \"Oh? You seemed determined last night. Did it look different to you after a night\u0027s sleep?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I admitted. \"It looked about the same, and this morning I went to a travel agent and managed to get a cheap seat on a flight leaving Friday evening.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"And then this afternoon somebody offered me a job and I said yes. You want to go to Ireland for three weeks? I don\u0027t think I can get my money back for the ticket.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure? It\u0027s a shame to lose the money.\"\\n\\n \"Well, they told me it was nonrefundable, and I already paid for it. It\u0027s all right, I\u0027m making enough on the job so that I can write off a couple hundred. But I did want to let you know that I wasn\u0027t on my way to the land of Sodom and Begorrah.\"\\n\\n \"It sounded like you were setting yourself up,\" he said. \"That\u0027s why I was concerned. You\u0027ve managed to hang out with your friend in his saloon and still stay sober-\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-7.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \\n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
