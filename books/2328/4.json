{"id":63696,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"THE drill was the same at the corner of Veterans and Sixty-sixth. Peter waited in the car. Kenan went to the phone, and it rang almost immediately. The kidnapper said, \"Very good. That didn\u0027t take long.\" \"Now what?\" \"Where\u0027s the money?\" \"In the backseat. In two Hefty bags, just like you said.\" \"Good. Now I want you and your brother to walk up Sixty-sixth Street to Avenue M.\" \"You want us to walk there?\" \"Yes.\" \"With the money?\" \"No, leave the money right where it is.\" \"In the backseat of the car.\" \"Yes. And leave the car unlocked.\" \"We leave the money in an unlocked car and walk a block-\" \"Two blocks, actually.\" \"And then what?\" \"Wait on the corner of Avenue M for five minutes. Then get in your car and go home.\" \"What about my wife?\" \"Your wife is fine.\" \"How do I-\" \"She\u0027ll be in the car waiting for you.\" \"She better be.\" \"What was that?\" \"Nothing. Look, there\u0027s one thing bothers me, that\u0027s leaving the money unattended in an unlocked car. What I\u0027m worried, somebody grabbing it before you get to it.\" \"Not to worry,\" the man said. \"This is a good neighborhood.\" THEY left the car unlocked, left the money in it, walked one short block and one long block to Avenue M. They waited five minutes by Peter\u0027s watch. Then they headed back toward the Buick. I don\u0027t think I ever described them, did I? They looked like brothers, Kenan and Peter. Kenan stood five-ten, which made him a scant inch taller than his brother. They were both built like rangy middleweights, although Peter was beginning to thicken just the least bit at the waist. Both had olive skin tones and straight dark hair, parted on the left and combed back neatly. At thirty-three, Kenan was starting to develop a slightly higher forehead as his hairline receded. Peter, two years older, still had all his hair. They were handsome men, with long straight noses and dark eyes set deep under prominent brows. Peter had a mustache, neatly trimmed. Kenan was cleanshaven. If you were going by appearances, and if you were up against the two of them, you would take Kenan out first. Or try to, anyway. There was something about him that suggested he was the more dangerous of the two, that his responses would be more sudden and more certain. That\u0027s how they looked, then, walking rapidly but not too rapidly back to the corner where Kenan\u0027s car was parked. It was still there, and still unlocked. The bags of money were no longer in the backseat. Francine Khoury wasn\u0027t there, either. Kenan said, \"Fuck this shit, man.\" \"The trunk?\" He opened the glove box, triggered the trunk release. He went around and lifted the lid. There was nothing in the trunk but the spare tire and the jack. He had just closed the trunk lid when the pay phone rang a dozen yards away. He ran to it, grabbed it. \"Go home,\" the man said. \"She\u0027ll probably get there before you do.\" I WENT to my usual evening meeting around the corner from my hotel at St. Paul the Apostle, but I left on the break. I returned to my room and called Elaine and told her about the conversation with Mick. \"I think you should go,\" she said. \"I think that\u0027s a great idea.\" \"Suppose we both go.\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know, Matt. It would mean missing classes.\" She was taking a course Thursday evenings at Hunter, in fact she\u0027d just got back from it when I called. \"Indian Art and Architecture Under the Moghuls.\" \"We\u0027d just go for a week or ten days,\" I said. \"You\u0027d miss one class.\" \"One class isn\u0027t such a big deal.\" \"Exactly, so-\" \"So I guess what it comes down to is I don\u0027t really want to go. I\u0027d be a fifth wheel, wouldn\u0027t I? I have this picture in my mind of you and Mick rocketing around the countryside and teaching the Irish how to raise hell.\" \"That\u0027s some picture.\" \"But what I mean is it\u0027d be a sort of boy\u0027s night out, wouldn\u0027t it, and who needs a girl along? Seriously, I don\u0027t particularly want to go, and I know you\u0027re restless and I think it would do you a world of good. You\u0027ve never been anywhere in Europe?\" \"Never.\" \"How long has Mick been gone? A month?\" \"Just about.\" \"I think you should go.\" \"Maybe,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll think about it.\" SHE wasn\u0027t there. Nowhere in the house. Kenan went compulsively from room to room, knowing it was senseless, knowing she couldn\u0027t have gotten past the alarm system without either setting it off or disarming it. When he ran out of rooms he went back to the kitchen, where Peter was making coffee. He said, \"Petey, this really sucks.\" \"I know it, babe.\" \"You\u0027re making coffee? I don\u0027t think I want any. Bother you if I have a drink?\" \"Bother me if I have a drink. Not if you do.\" \"I just thought- never mind. I don\u0027t even want one.\" \"That\u0027s where we differ, babe.\" \"Yeah, I guess.\" He spun around. \"Why the fuck are they jerking me around like this, Petey? They say she\u0027s gonna be in the car and then she\u0027s not. They say she\u0027ll be here and she isn\u0027t. What the fuck\u0027s going on?\" \"Maybe they got stuck in traffic.\" \"Man, what happens now? We fucking sit here and wait? I don\u0027t even know what we\u0027re waiting for. They got the money and we got what? Fucked is what we got. I don\u0027t know who they are or where they are. I don\u0027t know zip, and- Petey, what do we do?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"I think she\u0027s dead,\" he said. Peter was silent. \"Because why wouldn\u0027t they, the fucks? She could identify them. Safer to kill her than to give her back. Kill her, bury her, and that\u0027s the end of it. Case closed. That\u0027s what I would do, I was them.\" \"No you wouldn\u0027t.\" \"I said if I was them. I\u0027m not, I wouldn\u0027t kidnap some woman in the first place, innocent gentle lady who never did anybody any harm, never had an unkind thought-\" \"Easy, babe.\" They would fall silent and then the conversation would begin again, because what else was there to do? After half an hour of this the phone rang and Kenan jumped for it. \"Mr. Khoury.\" \"Where is she?\" \"My apologies. There was a slight change in plans.\" \"Where is she?\" \"Just around the corner from you, oh, uh, Seventy-ninth Street, I believe it\u0027s the south side of the street, three or four houses from the corner-\" \"What?\" \"There\u0027s a car parked illegally at a fire hydrant. A gray Ford Tempo. Your wife is in it.\" \"She\u0027s in the car?\" \"In the trunk.\" \"You put her in the trunk?\" \"There\u0027s plenty of air. But it\u0027s cold out tonight so you\u0027ll want to get her out of there as soon as possible.\" \"Is there a key? How do I-\" \"The lock\u0027s broken. You won\u0027t need a key.\" Running down the street and around the corner, he said to Peter, \"What did he mean, the lock\u0027s broken? If the trunk\u0027s not locked why can\u0027t she just crawl out? What\u0027s he talking about?\" \"I don\u0027t know, babe.\" \"Maybe she\u0027s tied up. Tape, handcuffs, something so she can\u0027t move.\" \"Maybe.\" \"Oh, Jesus, Pete-\" The car was where it was supposed to be, a battered Tempo several years old, its windshield starred and the passenger door deeply dented. The trunk lock was missing altogether. Kenan flung the lid open. No one in there. Just packages, bundles of some sort. Bundles of various sizes wrapped in black plastic and secured with freezer tape. \"No,\" Kenan said. He stood there, saying \"No, no, no.\" After a moment Peter took one of the parcels from the trunk, got a jackknife from his pocket, and cut away the tape. He unwound the length of black plastic- it was not unlike the Hefty bags in which the money had been delivered- and drew out a human foot, severed a couple of inches above the ankle. Three toenails showed circles of red polish. The other two toes were missing. Kenan put his head back and howled like a dog. Chapter 2 That was Thursday. Monday I got back from lunch and there was a message for me at the desk. Call Peter Curry, it said, and there was a number and the 718 area code, which meant Brooklyn or Queens. I didn\u0027t think I knew a Peter Curry in Brooklyn or Queens, or anywhere else for that matter, but it\u0027s not unheard-of for me to get calls from people I don\u0027t know. I went up to my room and called the number on the slip, and when a man answered I said, \"Mr. Curry?\" \"Yes?\" \"My name\u0027s Matthew Scudder, I got a message to call you.\" \"You got a message to call me?\" \"That\u0027s right. It says here you called at twelve-fifteen.\" \"What was the name again?\" I gave it to him again, and he said, \"Oh, wait a minute, you\u0027re the detective, right? My brother called you, my brother Peter.\" \"It says Peter Curry.\" \"Hold on.\" I held on, and after a moment another voice, close to the first but a note deeper, a little bit softer, said, \"Matt, this is Pete.\" \"Pete,\" I said. \"Do I know you, Pete?\" \"Yeah, we know each other, but you wouldn\u0027t necessarily know my name. I\u0027m pretty regular at St. Paul \u0027s, I led a meeting there, oh, five or six weeks ago.\" \"Peter Curry,\" I said. \"It\u0027s Khoury,\" he said. \"I\u0027m of Lebanese descent, lemme see how to describe myself. I\u0027m sober about a year and a half, I\u0027m in a rooming house way west on Fifty-fifth Street, I\u0027ve been working as a messenger and delivery boy but my field is film editing, only I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll be able to get back into it-\" \" Lot of drugs in your story.\" \"That\u0027s right, but it was alcohol really stuck it to me at the end. You\u0027ve got me placed?\" \"Uh-huh. I was there the night you spoke. I just never knew your last name.\" \"Well, that\u0027s the program for you.\" \"What can I do for you, Pete?\" \"I\u0027d like it if you could come out and talk with me and my brother. You\u0027re a detective and I think that\u0027s what we need.\" \"Could you give me some idea what it\u0027s about?\" \"Well-\" \"Not over the phone?\" \"Probably better not to, Matt. It\u0027s detective work and it\u0027s important, and we\u0027ll pay whatever you say.\" \"Well,\" I said, \"I don\u0027t know that I\u0027m open to work right now, Pete. As a matter of fact I\u0027ve got a trip planned, I\u0027ll be going overseas the end of the week.\" \"Whereabouts?\" \" Ireland.\" \"That sounds great,\" he said. \"But look, Matt, couldn\u0027t you just come out here and let us lay it out for you? You listen, and if you decide you can\u0027t do anything for us, no hard feelings and we\u0027ll pay for your time and your cab out and back.\" In the background the brother said something I couldn\u0027t make out, and Pete said, \"I\u0027ll tell him. Matt, Kenan says we could drive in and pick you up, but we\u0027d have to come back here and I think it\u0027s quicker if you just jump in a taxi.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-4.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
