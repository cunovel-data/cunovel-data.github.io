{"id":63764,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"I called Brooklyn Information and tried to find a listing for a Raymond Callander, or an R or RJ Callander. The operator pointed out that there were other ways to spell that last name, and checked more possibilities than would have occurred to me. Spelled one way or another, there were a couple of listings for R and one RJ, but the addresses were way off, one on Meserole in Greenpoint, another way over in Brownsville, none of them anywhere near Sunset Park.\n Maddening, but then the whole case had been like that from the beginning. I kept getting teased, making major breakthroughs that didn\u0027t really lead anywhere. Turning up Pam Cassidy had been the best example. From out of nowhere we\u0027d managed to produce a living witness, and the bottom-line result of that was that the cops had taken three dead cases and shoved them all into a single open file.\n Pam had provided a first name. Now I had a last name to go with it, and even a middle name, all thanks to TJ with an assist from Bellamy. I had an address, too, but it had probably stopped being valid at about the time the phone was disconnected.\n He wouldn\u0027t be all that hard to find. It\u0027s easier when you know who you\u0027re looking for. I had enough now to find him, if I was able to wait until daytime, and if I could allow a few days for the search.\n But that wasn\u0027t good enough. I wanted to find him now.\n IN the living room, Kenan was on the phone, Peter at the window. I didn\u0027t see Yuri. I joined Peter, and he told me that Yuri had gone out to look for more money.\n \"I couldn\u0027t look at the money,\" he said. \"I was getting an anxiety attack. Rapid heartbeat, cold damp hands, the whole bit.\"\n \"What was the fear?\"\n \"Fear? I don\u0027t know. It just made me want to do some dope, that\u0027s all. You gave me a word-association test right now, every response\u0027d be heroin. A Rorschach, every ink-blot\u0027d look like some dope fiend bangin\u0027 himself in a vein.\"\n \"But you\u0027re not doing it, Pete.\"\n \"What\u0027s the difference, man? I know I\u0027m gonna. All it is is a question of when. Beautiful out there, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"The ocean?\"\n He nodded. \"Only you can\u0027t really see it anymore. Must be nice living where you can look out at water. I had a girlfriend once, she was into astrology, told me that\u0027s my element, water. You believe in that stuff?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know much about it.\"\n \"She was right that it\u0027s my element. I don\u0027t like the others too much. Air, I never liked to fly. Wouldn\u0027t want to burn up in a fire or be buried in the earth. But the sea, that\u0027s the mother of us all, isn\u0027t that what they say?\"\n \"I guess.\"\n \"That\u0027s the ocean out there, too. Not a river or a bay. That\u0027s just nothing but water, straight on out, farther than you can see. Makes me feel clean just to look at it.\"\n I clapped him on the shoulder and left him looking at the ocean. Kenan was off the phone, and I went to ask him how the count stood.\n \"We got a shade under half of it,\" he said. \"I been calling in every favor I got coming and Yuri\u0027s been doing the same. I got to tell you, I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to find a whole lot more.\"\n \"The only person I can think of is in Ireland. I hope this looks like a million, that\u0027s all. All it has to do is get past whatever rough count they give it on the spot.\"\n \"Suppose we shoot some air into it. If every pack of hundreds is short five bills, you got a tenth again more packs.\"\n \"Which is fine unless they pick one pack at random and spot-count it.\"\n \"Good point,\" he said. \"First glance, this is going to look like a good deal more than what I handed over to them. That was all hundreds. This has about twenty-five percent of the total in fifties. You know there\u0027s a way to make it look like a lot more than it is.\"\n \"Bulk it up with cut paper.\"\n \"I was thinking with singles. The paper\u0027s right, the color, everything but the denomination. Say you got a stack, supposed to be fifty hundred-dollar bills, total of five grand. You dummy it up with ten hundreds on top and ten on the bottom and fill in with thirty singles. \u0027Stead of five grand you have a little over two grand looking like five. Fan it, all you see is green.\"\n \"Same problem. It works unless you take a good look at one of the dummied-up packets. Then you see it\u0027s not what it\u0027s supposed to be, and you know right away, no argument, that it was phonied up that way to fool you. And if you\u0027re a nut case to begin with, and you\u0027ve been looking for an excuse to murder all night long-\"\n \"You kill the girl, bang, and it\u0027s over.\"\n \"That\u0027s the trouble with anything flagrant. If it looks as though we\u0027re trying to screw them-\"\n \"They\u0027ll take it personally.\" He nodded. \"Maybe they won\u0027t count the stacks. You got fifties and hundreds mixed, five thousand to a stack, half that in a stack of fifties, how many stacks are we talking if we come in at half a mil? A hundred if it\u0027s all hundreds, so call it a hundred and twenty, thirty, something like that?\"\n \"Sounds right.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, would you count it? You count in a dope deal, but you\u0027ve got time, you sit back, you count the money and inspect the product. Different story. Even so, you know how the big traffickers count? The guys who turn upwards of a mil in each transaction?\"\n \"I know the banks have machines that can count a stack of bills as quickly as you can riffle through it.\"\n \"Sometimes they use those,\" he said, \"but mostly it\u0027s weight. You know how much money weighs, so you just load it on the scale.\"\n \"Is that what they did at the family enterprise in Togo?\"\n He smiled at the thought. \"No, that was different,\" he said. \"They counted every bill. But nobody was in a hurry.\"\n The phone rang. We looked at each other. I picked it up, and it was Yuri on the car phone, saying he was on his way. When I hung up Kenan said, \"Every time the phone rings-\"\n \"I know. I think it\u0027s him. When you were out before we had a wrong number, some guy who called twice because he kept forgetting to dial two-one-two for Manhattan.\"\n \"Pain in the ass,\" he said. \"When I was a kid we had a number that was one digit off from a pizzeria on Prospect and Flatbush. You can imagine the wrong numbers we got.\"\n \"Must have been a nuisance.\"\n \"For my parents. Me and Petey, we loved it. We\u0027d take the fucking order. \u0027Half cheese and half pepperoni? No anchovies? Yessir, we\u0027ll have it ready for you.\u0027 And fuck \u0027em, let \u0027em go hungry. We were terrible.\"\n \"Poor bastard in the pizza place.\"\n \"Yeah, I know. I don\u0027t get many wrong numbers these days. You know when I got a couple? The day Francey was kidnapped. That morning, like God was sending me a message, trying to give me some kind of a warning. God, when I think what she must have gone through. And what that kid\u0027s going through now.\"\n I said, \"I know his name, Kenan.\"\n \"Whose name?\"\n \"The one on the phone. Not the rough half of their rough-and-smooth act. The other one, the one who does most of the talking.\"\n \"You told me. Ray.\"\n \"Ray Callander. I know his old address in Queens. I know the license plate on his Honda.\"\n \"I thought he had a truck.\"\n \"He\u0027s got a two-door Civic, too. We\u0027re going to get him, Kenan. Maybe not tonight, but we\u0027re going to get him.\"\n \"That\u0027s good,\" he said slowly. \"But I have to tell you something. You know, I got in on this because of what happened to my wife. That\u0027s why I hired you, that\u0027s why I\u0027m here to begin with. But right now none of that means shit. Right now the only thing matters to me is this kid, Lucia, Luschka, Ludmilla, she\u0027s got all these different names and I don\u0027t know what to call her and I never met her in my life. But all I care about now is getting her back.\"\n Thank you, I thought.\n Because, as it says on the T-shirts, when you\u0027re up to your ass in alligators you can forget that your primary purpose is to drain the swamp. It didn\u0027t matter right now where the two of them were holed up in Sunset Park, didn\u0027t matter if I found out tonight or tomorrow or never. In the morning I could hand everything I had to John Kelly and let him take it from there. It didn\u0027t matter who brought Callander in, and it didn\u0027t matter if he did fifteen years or twenty-five years or life, or if he died in some side street at Kenan Khoury\u0027s hands or at mine. Or if he got away scot-free, with or without the money. That might matter tomorrow. It might not. But it didn\u0027t matter tonight.\n It was very clear suddenly, as it really should have been all along. The only thing of importance was getting the girl back. Nothing else mattered at all.\n YURI and Dani came back a few minutes before eight. Yuri had a flight bag in either hand, both bearing the logo of an airline that had vanished in mergers. Dani was carrying a shopping bag.\n \"Hey, we\u0027re in business,\" Kenan said, and his brother beat his hands together in applause. I didn\u0027t start clapping, but I felt the same excitement. You\u0027d have thought the money was for us.\n Yuri said, \"Kenan, come here a minute. Look at this.\"\n He opened one of the flight bags and spilled out its contents, banded stacks of hundreds, each wrapper bearing the imprint of the Chase Manhattan Bank.\n \"Beautiful,\" he said. \"What\u0027d you do, Yuri, make an unauthorized withdrawal? How\u0027d you find a bank to rob this hour of the night?\"\n Yuri handed him a stack of bills. Kenan slipped them from their wrapper, looked at the top one, and said, \"I don\u0027t have to look, do I? You wouldn\u0027t ask me if everything was kosher. This is schlock, right?\" He looked closely, thumbed the bill aside and looked at the next one. \"Schlock,\" he confirmed. \"But very nice. All the same serial number? No, this one\u0027s different.\"\n \"Three different numbers,\" Yuri said.\n \"Wouldn\u0027t pass banks,\" Kenan said. \"They got scanners, pick up something electronically. Aside from that, they look good to me.\" He crumpled a bill, smoothed it out, held it to the light and squinted at it. \"Paper\u0027s good. Ink looks right. Nice used bills, must have soaked \u0027em with coffee grounds and then ran \u0027em through the Maytag. No bleach, hold the fabric softener. Matt?\"\n I took a real bill- or what I assumed was a real bill- from my own wallet and held it next to the one Kenan handed me. It seemed to me that Franklin looked a little less serene on the counterfeit specimen, a little more rakish. But I would never have given the bill a second glance in the ordinary course of things.\n \"Very nice,\" Kenan said. \"What\u0027s the discount?\"\n \"Sixty percent in quantity. You pay forty cents on the dollar.\"\n \"High.\"\n \"Good stuff don\u0027t come cheap,\" Yuri said.\n \"That\u0027s true. It\u0027s a cleaner business than dope, too. Because who gets hurt, you stop and think about it?\"\n \"Debases the currency,\" Peter said.\n \"Does it really? It\u0027s such a drop in the bucket. One savings-and-loan goes belly-up and it debases the currency more than twenty years\u0027 worth of counterfeiting.\"\n Yuri said, \"This is on loan. No charge if we recover it and I bring it back. Otherwise I owe for it. Forty cents on the dollar.\"\n \"That\u0027s very decent.\"\n \"He\u0027s doing me a favor. What I want to know, will they spot it? And if they do-\"\n \"They won\u0027t,\" I said. \"They\u0027ll be looking quickly in bad light, and I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll be thinking of counterfeit. The bank wrappers are a nice touch. He print them, too?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-39.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: \n A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
