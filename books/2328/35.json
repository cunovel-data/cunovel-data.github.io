{"id":63758,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"He was in his late forties, and he had been in America for ten years. He\u0027d come over with his wife and his four-year-old daughter, Ludmilla. He\u0027d done some sort of black-market trading in the Soviet Union, and in Brooklyn he gravitated easily into various marginal enterprises, and before long began trafficking in narcotics. He had done well, but then it is a business in which nobody breaks even. If you don\u0027t get killed or imprisoned, you generally do very well.\\n\\n Four years ago his wife had been diagnosed with metastasized ovarian cancer. Chemotherapy had kept her alive for two and a half years. She had hoped to live to see her daughter graduate from intermediate school, but she died in the fall. Ludmilla, who now called herself Lucia, had graduated in the spring, and was now a member of the freshman class of Chichester Academy, a small private high school for girls located in Brooklyn Heights. The tuition was high, but so were the academic requirements, and Chichester had an excellent record at placing its graduates in Ivy League colleges, as well as women\u0027s colleges like Bryn Mawr and Smith.\\n\\n When he\u0027d started calling people in the business to warn them about the possibility of kidnapping, Kenan had very nearly not called Yuri Landau. They were not close, they barely knew each other, but more to the point Kenan saw Landau as invulnerable. The man\u0027s wife was already dead.\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t even thought about the daughter. Still, he\u0027d made the call, and Landau had taken it as confirmation of a course of action he had adopted when he\u0027d first sent Lucia off to Chichester. Instead of letting her take subways or buses, he\u0027d arranged to have a car service pick her up every morning at seven-thirty and collect her in front of Chichester every afternoon at a quarter to three. If she wanted to go to a friend\u0027s house the car service would take her there, and she was instructed to call them when she wanted to come home. If she wanted to go anywhere in the neighborhood, she usually took the dog with her. The dog was a Rhodesian Ridgeback, and actually very gentle, but looked ferocious enough to constitute a powerful deterrent.\\n\\n Early that afternoon, the telephone rang in the office of Chichester Academy. A well-spoken gentleman explained that he was an assistant to Mr. Landau and was requesting that the school dismiss Ludmilla half an hour early because of a family emergency. \"I\u0027ve made arrangements with the car service,\" he assured the woman to whom he spoke, \"and they\u0027ll have a vehicle waiting in front of the school at two-fifteen, although it probably will not be the car and driver she had this morning.\" And, he added, if there were any questions she was not to call Mr. Landau\u0027s residence; instead she could reach him, Mr. Pettibone, at a number he would give her now.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t have to call the number, because there was no problem following his request. She summoned Lucia (no one at school knew her as Ludmilla) to the office and told her she would be dismissed early. At ten minutes after two the woman looked out the window and saw that a dark green truck or van was parked directly in front of the school\u0027s entrance on Pineapple Street. It was quite unlike the late-model GM sedans that normally brought the girl in the morning and took her away in the afternoon, but it was clearly the right vehicle. The car service\u0027s name and address was plainly visible in white letters on its side. Chaverim Livery Service, with an address on Ocean Avenue. And the driver, who walked around the truck so that he could hold the door for Lucia, wore a blue blazer the way they always did, and had one of those caps.\\n\\n For her part, Lucia got into the van without hesitation. The driver closed the door, walked around the vehicle, got behind the wheel, and drove to the corner of Willow Street, at which point the woman stopped watching.\\n\\n At a quarter to three the rest of the school was dismissed, and a few minutes later Lucia\u0027s regular driver showed up in the gray Oldsmobile Regency Brougham in which he had driven Lucia to school that morning. He waited patiently at the curb, knowing that Lucia was routinely as much as fifteen minutes late leaving the building. He would have waited that long and longer without complaint, but one of Lucia\u0027s classmates recognized him and told him he must have made a mistake. \"Because she was dismissed early,\" she said. \"She got picked up like half an hour ago.\"\\n\\n \"Come on,\" he said, thinking she was playing a joke on him.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true! Her father called the office and one of your cars already came and picked her up. Ask Miss Severance if you don\u0027t believe me.\"\\n\\n The driver did not go in and confirm this with Miss Severance; if he had, that woman would almost certainly have called the Landau residence, and, quite possibly, the police. Instead he used his own car radio to call his dispatcher on Ocean Avenue and ask him what the hell was going on. \"If she needed an early pickup,\" he said, \"then you coulda sent me. Or if you can\u0027t get me, at least tell me to skip my regular pickup.\"\\n\\n The dispatcher, of course, didn\u0027t know what the driver was talking about. When she got the gist of it she figured out the only thing that made sense to her, that for some reason Landau had called another car service. She might have let it go at that. Maybe all their lines had been busy, maybe he\u0027d been in a rush, maybe he\u0027d picked the child up himself and hadn\u0027t been able to call off the scheduled car. But something evidently bothered her, because she looked up Yuri Landau\u0027s number and called him.\\n\\n At first Yuri didn\u0027t get what all the fuss was about. So somebody at Chaverim made a mistake, and two cars went instead of one, and the second driver made the trip for nothing. How was that something to call him about? Then he began to realize that something out of the ordinary was going on. He got as much information as he could from the dispatcher, said he was sorry if there had been any inconvenience, and got her off the line.\\n\\n Next he called the school, and when he spoke with Miss Severance and heard about the call from his assistant, Mr. Pettibone, there was really no question about it. Someone had managed to lure his daughter out of the school and into a van. Someone had kidnapped her.\\n\\n At this point the Severance woman also figured it out, but Landau dissuaded her from calling the police. It would be best handled privately, he said, improvising as he went along. \"Relatives on her mother\u0027s side, extremely Orthodox, you could call them religious fanatics. They\u0027ve been after me to pull her out of Chichester and send her to some crazy kosher school in Borough Park. Don\u0027t worry about a thing, I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll be back in your school tomorrow.\"\\n\\n Then he hung up the phone and started to tremble.\\n\\n They had his daughter. What did they want? He\u0027d give them what they wanted, the bastards, he\u0027d give them anything he had. But who were they? And what in God\u0027s name did they want?\\n\\n Hadn\u0027t someone said something just a few weeks ago about a kidnapping?\\n\\n He remembered, then, and called Kenan. Who called me.\\n\\n YURI Landau had the penthouse apartment in a twelve-story brick co-op on Brightwater Court. In the tiled lobby, two thick-bodied young Russians in tweed jackets and caps braced us as we entered. Peter ignored the uniformed doorman and told the others that his name was Khoury and Mr. Landau was expecting us. One of them rode up with us in the elevator.\\n\\n By the time we got there, around four-thirty, Yuri had just received his first call from the kidnappers. He was still reacting to it. \"A million dollars,\" he cried. \"Where am I going to get a million dollars? Who\u0027s doing this, Kenan? Is it niggers? Is it those crazies from Jamaica?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s white guys,\" Kenan said.\\n\\n \"My Luschka,\" he said. \"How could this happen? What kind of a country is this?\" He broke off when he saw us. \"You\u0027re the brother,\" he said to Peter. \"And you?\"\\n\\n \"Matthew Scudder.\"\\n\\n \"You been working for Kenan. Good. Thanks to both of you for coming. But how did you get in? You walked right in? I had two men in the lobby, they were supposed to-\" He caught sight of the man who had come up with us. \"Oh, there you are, Dani, that\u0027s a good boy. Go back down to the lobby and keep an eye out.\" To no one in particular he said, \"Now I post guards. The horse is stolen so I lock the barn. For what? What can they take from me now? God took my wife, the dirty bastard, and these other bastards take my Luddy, my Luschka.\" He turned to Kenan. \"And if I post men downstairs from the time you called me, what good does it do? They get her out of school, they steal her away under everybody\u0027s nose. I wish I did what you did. You sent her out of the country, yes?\"\\n\\n Kenan and I looked at each other.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s this? You told me you sent your wife out of the country.\"\\n\\n Kenan said, \"That was the story we settled on, Yuri.\"\\n\\n \"Story? Why did you need a story? What happened?\"\\n\\n \"She was kidnapped.\"\\n\\n \"Your wife.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"How much did they hit you for?\"\\n\\n \"They asked a million. We negotiated, we settled on a lower figure.\"\\n\\n \"How much?\"\\n\\n \"Four hundred thousand.\"\\n\\n \"And you paid the money? You got her back?\"\\n\\n \"I paid.\"\\n\\n \"Kenan,\" he said. He took him by the shoulders. \"Tell me, please. You got her back, yes?\"\\n\\n \"Dead,\" Kenan said.\\n\\n \"Oh, no,\" Yuri said. He reeled as if from a blow, threw up an arm to shield his face. \"No,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t tell me that.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Landau-\"\\n\\n He ignored me, took Kenan by the arm. \"But you paid,\" he said. \"You gave them an honest count? You didn\u0027t try to chisel them?\"\\n\\n \"I paid, Yuri. They killed her anyway.\"\\n\\n His shoulders sagged. \"Why?\" he demanded, not of us but of that dirty bastard God who took his wife. \"Why?\"\\n\\n I stepped in and said, \"Mr. Landau, these are very dangerous men, vicious and unpredictable. They\u0027ve killed at least two women in addition to Mrs. Khoury. As things stand, they haven\u0027t got the slightest intention of releasing your daughter alive. I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s a strong possibility that she\u0027s already dead.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"If she\u0027s alive we have a chance. But you have to decide how you want to handle this.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"You could call the police.\"\\n\\n \"They said no cops.\"\\n\\n \"Naturally they\u0027d say that.\"\\n\\n \"The last thing I want is cops here, poking into my life. As soon as I come up with the ransom money they\u0027ll want to know where it came from. But if it gets my daughter back… What do you think? We have a better chance if we call the cops?\"\\n\\n \"You might have a better chance of catching the men who took her.\"\\n\\n \"To hell with that. What about getting her back?\"\\n\\n She\u0027s dead, I thought, but told myself that I didn\u0027t know it, and that he didn\u0027t have to hear it. I said, \"I don\u0027t think police involvement at this stage would increase the chance of recovering your daughter alive. I think it might have the opposite effect. If the cops come in and the kidnappers know about it, they\u0027ll cut their losses and run. And they won\u0027t leave the girl alive.\"\\n\\n \"So fuck the cops. We\u0027ll do it ourselves. Now what?\"\\n\\n \"Now I have to make a phone call.\"\\n\\n \"Go ahead. Wait, I want to keep the line open. They called, I talked with him, I had a million questions and he hung up on me. \u0027Stay off the line. We\u0027ll get back to you.\u0027 Use my daughter\u0027s phone, it\u0027s through that door. Kids, on the phone all the time, you could never reach the house. I had that other thing, Call Waiting, drove everybody crazy. All the time clicking in your ear, telling this one to hold on, you have to take a call. Terrible. I got rid of it, got her her own phone, she could stay on it all she wanted. God, take anything I got, just give her back to me!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-35.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \\n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
