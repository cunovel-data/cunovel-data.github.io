Say around twelve, twelve-thirty?\"\\n\\n \"Which?\"\\n\\n \"Twelve-thirty.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s twelve-thirty in the daytime or in the night?\"\\n\\n \"Daytime. We\u0027ll have some lunch.\"\\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t no time of the day or night you can\u0027t have lunch,\" he said. \"You want me to come by your hotel?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said, \"because there\u0027s a chance I\u0027ll have to cancel and I wouldn\u0027t have any way to let you know. So I don\u0027t want to hang you up. Pick a place on the Deuce and if I don\u0027t show up we\u0027ll make it another time.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s cool,\" he said. \"You know the video arcade? Uptown side of the street, two, three doors from Eighth Avenue? There\u0027s the store with the switchknives in the window, man, I don\u0027t know how they get away with that-\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re sold in kit form.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, an\u0027 they use it for an IQ test. You can\u0027t put the kit together, you have to go back an\u0027 do first grade all over again. You know the store I mean.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"Right next to it there\u0027s the entrance to the subway, and before you go down the stairs there\u0027s an entranceway to the video arcade. You know where it\u0027s at?\"\\n\\n \"I have a hunch I can find it.\"\\n\\n \"Say twelve-thirty?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a date, Kate.\"\\n\\n \"Hey,\" he said. \"You know somethin\u0027? You learnin\u0027.\"\\n\\n I FELT better when I got off the phone with TJ. He usually had that effect on me. I made a note of our lunch date, then picked up the Gotteskind material again.\\n\\n It was the same perpetrators. Had to be. The similarity of MO was too great to be coincidental, and the amputation and insertion of the thumb and forefinger looked like a rehearsal for the more extensive butchery they\u0027d practiced on Francine Khoury.\\n\\n But what did they do, go into hibernation? Lie low for a year?\\n\\n It seemed unlikely. Sex-linked violence- serial rape, lust murder- seems to be addictive, like any strong drug that releases you momentarily from the prison of self. Marie Gotteskind\u0027s killers had pulled off a perfectly orchestrated abduction, only to repeat it a year later with very minor variations and, of course, a substantial profit motive. Why wait so long? What were they doing in the meantime?\\n\\n Could there have been other abductions without anyone drawing a connection to the Gotteskind case? It was possible. The murder rate in the five boroughs is now over seven a day, and most of them don\u0027t get a lot of play in the media. Still, if you take a woman off a street in front of a bunch of witnesses, it makes the papers. If you\u0027ve got a similar case sitting in an open file, you probably hear about it. And you almost have to draw a connection.\\n\\n On the other hand, Francine Khoury had been snatched off the street in front of witnesses, and nobody in the press or the One-Twelve knew the first thing about it.\\n\\n Maybe they really had lain low for a year. Maybe one or more of them had been in jail for all or part of that year, maybe a predilection for rape and murder had led to still worse crimes, like writing bad checks.\\n\\n Or maybe they\u0027d been active, but in a way that hadn\u0027t drawn any attention.\\n\\n Either way, I knew something now that I had previously only suspected. They had done this before, for pleasure if not for profit. That lowered the odds against finding them, and at the same time it raised the stakes.\\n\\n Because they\u0027d do it again.\\n\\n Chapter 7\\n\\n Friday I spent the morning at the library, then walked over to Forty-second Street to meet TJ in the video arcade. Together we watched a kid with a ponytail and a wispy blond mustache run up the score on a game called Freeze!!! It had the same premise as most of the games- i.e., that there were hostile forces in the universe, apt to leap out at you without warning at any moment, bound on doing you harm. If you were quick enough you could survive for a while, but sooner or later one of them would do you in. I couldn\u0027t argue with that.\\n\\n We left when the boy finally crapped out. On the street TJ told me the player\u0027s name was Socks because his own never matched. I hadn\u0027t noticed. According to TJ, Socks was about the best on the Deuce at what he did, often able to play for hours on a single quarter. There had been other players as good or better, but they didn\u0027t come around much anymore. For a moment my mind spun with visions of a previously unknown motive for serial homicide, video-game aces rubbed out by an arcade proprietor because they were eating up his profits, but that wasn\u0027t it. You got to a certain level, he explained, and then you couldn\u0027t get any better, and eventually you lost interest.\\n\\n We had lunch at a Mexican place on Ninth Avenue and he tried to get me to talk about the case I was working on. I left out the details, but I probably wound up telling him more than I intended to.\\n\\n \"What you need,\" he said, \"you need me workin\u0027 for you.\"\\n\\n \"Doing what?\"\\n\\n \"Anything you say! You don\u0027t want to be runnin\u0027 all over town, see this, check that. What you want to do is send me. You don\u0027t think I can find things out? Man, I\u0027m down here on the Deuce every day findin\u0027 things out. It\u0027s what I do.\"\\n\\n \"SO I gave him something,\" I told Elaine. We\u0027d met at the Baronet on Third Avenue to catch a four o\u0027clock movie, then went to a new place she\u0027d heard about where they served English tea with scones and clotted cream. \"He\u0027d said something earlier that added another item to my list of things to find out, so I figured it was only fair to let him run it down for me.\"\\n\\n \"What was that?\"\\n\\n \"The pay phones,\" I said. \"When Kenan and his brother delivered the ransom, they were sent to a pay phone. They got a call there, and the caller sent them to still another pay phone, where they got a call telling them to leave the money and take a hike.\"\\n\\n \"I remember.\"\\n\\n \"Well, yesterday TJ called me and talked until his quarter dropped, and when I wanted to call him back I couldn\u0027t, because the number wasn\u0027t posted on the phone he was calling from. I walked around the neighborhood on my way to the library this morning, and most of the phones are like that.\"\\n\\n \"You mean the little slips are missing? I know people will steal absolutely anything, but that\u0027s the stupidest thing I ever heard of.\"\\n\\n \"The phone company removes them,\" I said, \"to discourage drug dealers. They beep each other from pay phones, you know how it works, and now they can\u0027t do that.\"\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s why all the drug dealers are going out of business,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m sure it looked good on paper. Anyway, I got to thinking about those pay phones in Brooklyn, and I wondered if their numbers were posted.\"\\n\\n \"What difference does it make?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Probably somewhere between not much and none at all, which is why I didn\u0027t chase out to Brooklyn myself. But I can\u0027t see where it would hurt me to have the information, so I gave TJ a couple of dollars and sent him to Brooklyn.\"\\n\\n \"Does he know his way around Brooklyn?\"\\n\\n \"He will by the time he gets back. The first phone\u0027s a few blocks from the last stop on the Flatbush IRT, so that\u0027s fairly easy to find, but I don\u0027t know how the hell he\u0027s going to get to Veterans Avenue. A bus out of Flatbush, I suppose, and then a long hike.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of neighborhood is it?\"\\n\\n \"It looked all right when I drove through it with the Khourys. I didn\u0027t pay a whole lot of attention. A basic white working-class neighborhood, as far as I could tell. Why?\"\\n\\n \"You mean like Bensonhurst or Howard Beach? What I mean is will TJ stand out like a dark thumb?\"\\n\\n \"I never even thought of that.\"\\n\\n \"Because there are parts of Brooklyn where they get funny when a black kid walks down the street, even if he is conservatively dressed in high-top sneakers and a Raiders jacket, and I just know he has one of those haircuts.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got a sort of geometric design cut into the hair on the back of his neck.\"\\n\\n \"I thought he might. I hope he comes back alive.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be all right.\"\\n\\n Later in the evening she said, \"Matt, you were just making work for him, weren\u0027t you? TJ, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"No, he\u0027s saving me a trip. I would have had to run out there myself sooner or later, or catch a ride with one of the Khourys.\"\\n\\n \"Why? Couldn\u0027t you use your old cop tricks to wheedle the number out of the operator? Or look it up in a reverse directory?\"\\n\\n \"You have to know a number to look it up in a reverse directory. A reverse directory has phones listed numerically, and you look up the number and it tells you the location.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"But there is a book that lists pay phones by location, yes. And yes, I could call an operator and pass myself off as a police officer in order to obtain a number.\"\\n\\n \"So you were just being nice to TJ.\"\\n\\n \"Nice? According to you I was sending him to his death. No, I wasn\u0027t just being nice. Looking in the book or conning the operator would give me the number of the pay phone, but it wouldn\u0027t tell me if the number\u0027s posted on the phone. That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to find out.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she said. And, a few minutes later, \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Why what?\"\\n\\n \"Why do you care if the number\u0027s posted on the phone? What difference does it make?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that it does make a difference. But the kidnappers knew to call those phones. If the number\u0027s posted, well, then there was nothing special about their knowledge. If not, they found out one way or another.\"\\n\\n \"By conning the operator or looking in the book.\"\\n\\n \"Which would mean that they know how to con an operator, or where to find a list of pay phones. I don\u0027t know what it would mean. Probably nothing. Maybe I want to get the information because it\u0027s the only thing about the phones I can find out.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been nagging at me,\" I said. \"Not what I sent TJ for, that\u0027s easy enough to find out with or without his help. But I was sitting up last night and it struck me that the only contact with the kidnappers was phone contact. That was the only trace they left of themselves. The abduction itself was clean as a whistle. A few people saw them, and even more people saw them take that schoolteacher off Jamaica Avenue, but they didn\u0027t leave anything you could use to reel them in. But they did make some phone calls. They made four or five calls to Khoury\u0027s house in Bay Ridge.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no way to trace them, is there? After the connection is broken?\"\\n\\n \"There ought to be,\" I said. \"I was on the phone yesterday for over an hour with different phone-company personnel. I found out a lot of things about how the phones work. Every call you make is logged.\"\\n\\n \"Even local calls?\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. That\u0027s how they know how many message units you use in each billing period. It\u0027s not like a gas meter where they\u0027re just keeping track of the running total. Each call gets recorded and charged to your account.\"\\n\\n \"How long do they keep that data?\"\\n\\n \"Sixty days.\"\\n\\n \"So you could get a list-\"\\n\\n \"Of all the calls made from a particular number. That\u0027s how the data is organized. Say I\u0027m Kenan Khoury. I call up, I say I need to know what calls were made from my phone on a given day, and they can give me a printout with the date and time and duration of every call I made.\"\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s not what you want.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-13.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \\n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
