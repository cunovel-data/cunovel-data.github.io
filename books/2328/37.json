{"id":63762,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"\"The dog\u0027s name,\" I said into the phone, \"and the name of the dog before this one. Have her describe both dogs and furnish their names.\" He was amused. \"One dog won\u0027t do. It has to be two.\" \"Yes.\" \"So that you may be doubly reassured. I\u0027ll humor you, my friend.\" I WONDERED what he would do. He\u0027d have called from a pay phone. I was certain of that. He hadn\u0027t stayed on the line long enough for his quarter to run out, but he wasn\u0027t going to change the pattern now, not when it had worked so well for him. He was at a pay phone, and now he had to find out the name and description of two dogs, and then he would have to call me back. Assume for the moment that he wasn\u0027t calling from the laundromat phone. Assume he was at some phone on the street, far enough from his house that he\u0027d taken a car. Now he would drive back to the house, park, go inside, and ask Lucia Landau the names of her dogs. And then he would drive around to still another phone and relay the information back to me. Was that how I would do it? Well, maybe. But maybe not. Maybe I\u0027d spend a quarter and save a little time and running around, and call the house where my partner was guarding the girl. Let him take the gag out of her mouth for a minute and come back with the answers. If only we had the Kongs. Not for the first time, I thought how much easier it would be if Jimmy and David were set up in Lucia\u0027s bedroom, with their modem plugged into her Snoopy phone and the computer set up on her dressing table. They could sit on Lucia\u0027s phone and monitor her father\u0027s, and whenever anyone called we\u0027d have an instant trace. If Ray called home to find out the names of the dogs, we\u0027d be perching on that line, and before he knew what to call the dogs we\u0027d know where they were keeping the girl. Before he had relayed the information to me we could have cars at both locations, to pick him up when he got off the phone and to lay siege to the house. But I didn\u0027t have the Kongs. All I had was TJ, sitting in a laundromat in Sunset Park and waiting for someone to use the phone. And if he hadn\u0027t been profligate enough to squander half his funds on a beeper, I wouldn\u0027t even have that. \"Makes a person crazy,\" Yuri said. \"Sitting, staring at the phone, waiting for it to ring.\" And it was taking its time. Evidently Ray- that was how I was thinking of him, and I had come alarmingly close once already to calling him by name- evidently he had not called home, for whatever reason. Figure ten minutes to drive home, ten minutes to get the answers from the girl, ten minutes to get back to a phone and call us. Less if he hurried. More if he stopped to buy a pack of cigarettes, or if she was unconscious and they had to bring her around. Say half an hour. Maybe more, maybe less, but say half an hour. If she was dead it could take a little longer. Suppose she was. Suppose they\u0027d killed her right off the bat, killed her before their first call to her father. That, certainly, was the simplest way to do it. No danger of escape. No concern about keeping her quiet. And if she was dead? They couldn\u0027t admit it. Once they did there was no ransom. They were far from destitute, they\u0027d taken four hundred thousand from Kenan less than a month ago, but that didn\u0027t mean they didn\u0027t want more. Money was something people always wanted more of, and if they hadn\u0027t there would have been no first call, and probably no kidnapping. It was easy enough to pick a woman off the street at random if all you wanted was the thrill of it. You didn\u0027t need to get cute. So what would they do? I figured they would probably try to brazen it out. Say she was out of it, say she\u0027d been drugged and couldn\u0027t focus enough to respond to questions. Or make up some name and insist that was what she\u0027d told them. We would know they were lying and would be about ninety percent certain Lucia was dead. But you believe what you want to believe, and we would want to believe in the slender possibility that she was alive, and that might lead us to pay the ransom anyway because if we didn\u0027t pay there was no chance, no chance at all. The phone rang. I snatched it up, and it was some jerk with a wrong number. I got rid of him and thirty seconds later he called back again. I asked him what number he was calling, and he had it right, but it turned out he was trying to call someone in Manhattan. I reminded him he had to dial the area code first. \"Oh, God,\" he said, \"I\u0027m always doing that. I\u0027m so stupid.\" \"I got calls like that this morning,\" Yuri said. \"Wrong numbers. A nuisance.\" I nodded. Had he called while I was getting rid of that idiot? If so, why didn\u0027t he call back? The line was clear now. What the hell was he waiting for? Maybe I had made a mistake, asking for proof. If she was dead all along I was only forcing it all out into the open. Instead of trying to bluff it through, he might decide to write the operation off and scramble for cover. In which case I could wait forever for the phone to ring, because we wouldn\u0027t be hearing from him again. Yuri was right. It made a person crazy, sitting, staring at the phone. Waiting for it to ring. ACTUALLY it took only twelve minutes over the thirty minutes I\u0027d figured as an average. The phone rang and I grabbed it. I said hello, and Ray said, \"I\u0027d still like to know how you figure in this. You\u0027d have to be a dealer. Are you a major trafficker?\" \"You were going to answer some questions,\" I reminded him. \"I wish you\u0027d tell me your name,\" he said. \"I might recognize it.\" \"I might recognize yours.\" He laughed. \"Oh, I don\u0027t think so. Why are you in such a rush, my friend? Are you afraid I\u0027ll trace the call?\" In my mind I could hear him taunting Pam. \"Pick one, Pam-mee. One\u0027s for you and one\u0027s for me, so which\u0027ll it be, Pam-mee?\" I said, \"It\u0027s your quarter.\" \"So it is. Ah, well. The dog\u0027s name, eh? Let\u0027s see, what are the old standbys? Fido, Towser, King. Rover, that\u0027s always a popular favorite, isn\u0027t it?\" I thought, shit, she\u0027s dead. \"How about Spot? \u0027Run, Spot, run!\u0027 That\u0027s not a bad name for a Rhodesian Ridgeback.\" But he would have known that much from the weeks of stalking her. \"The dog\u0027s name is Watson.\" \"Watson,\" I said. Across the room, the big dog shifted position, pricked up its ears. Yuri was nodding. \"And the other dog?\" \"You want so much,\" he said. \"How many dogs do you need?\" I waited. \"She couldn\u0027t tell me what breed the other dog was. She was young when it died. They had to put it to sleep, she said. Silly term for it, don\u0027t you think? When you kill something you ought to have the courage to call it that. You\u0027re not saying anything. Are you still there?\" \"I\u0027m still here.\" \"I gather it was a mongrel. So many of us are. Now the name\u0027s a bit of a problem. It\u0027s a Russian word and I may not have it right. How\u0027s your Russian, my friend?\" \"A little rusty.\" \"Rusty\u0027s a good name for a dog. Maybe it was Rusty. You\u0027re a tough audience, my friend. It\u0027s hard to get a laugh out of you.\" \"I\u0027m a captive audience,\" I said. \"Ah, would that it were so. We could have a very interesting conversation under those circumstances, you and I. Ah, well. Some other time, perhaps.\" \"We\u0027ll see.\" \"Indeed we will. But you want the dog\u0027s name, don\u0027t you? The dog\u0027s dead, my friend. What good is his name? Give a dog a dead name, give a dead dog a bad name-\" I waited. \"I may be saying this wrong. Balalaika.\" \"Balalaika,\" I said. \"It\u0027s supposed to be the name of a musical instrument, or so she tells me. What do you say? Does it strike a chord?\" I looked at Yuri Landau. His nod was unequivocal. On the phone, Ray was saying something or other but the words weren\u0027t getting through to me. I felt light-headed, and had to lean against the kitchen counter or I might have fallen. The girl was alive. Chapter 19 As soon as I got off the phone with Ray, Yuri fell on me and wrapped me up in a bear hug. \"Balalaika,\" he said, invoking the name as if it were a magic spell. \"She\u0027s alive, my Luschka is alive!\" I was still in his embrace when the door opened and the Khourys came in, trailed by Landau\u0027s man Dani. Kenan was carrying an old-fashioned leather satchel with a zipper top, Peter a white plastic shopping bag from Kroger\u0027s. \"She\u0027s alive,\" Yuri told them. \"You spoke with her?\" He shook his head. \"They told me the dog\u0027s name. She remembered Balalaika. She\u0027s alive.\" I don\u0027t know how much sense this made to the Khourys, who had been out on a fund-raising mission when the recognition signals were arranged, but they got the gist of it. \"Now all you need is a million dollars,\" Kenan told him. \"Money you can always get.\" \"You\u0027re right,\" Kenan said. \"People don\u0027t realize that but it\u0027s absolutely true.\" He opened the leather satchel and began taking out stacks of wrapped bills, arranging them in rows on top of the mahogany table. \"You got some good friends, Yuri. Good thing, too, is most of \u0027em don\u0027t believe in banks. People don\u0027t realize how much of the country\u0027s economy runs on cash. You hear cash, you think drugs, you think gambling.\" \"Tip of the iceberg,\" Peter said. \"You got it. Don\u0027t just think of the rackets. Think dry cleaners, think barbershops, beauty parlors. Any place that handles a lot of cash, so they can keep an extra set of books and skim half the take out from under the IRS.\" \"Think coffee shops,\" Peter said. \"Yuri, you shoulda been a Greek.\" \"A Greek? Why should I be a Greek?\" \"Every corner there\u0027s a coffee shop, right? Man, I worked for one of them. Ten employees on my shift, six of us were off the books, paid in cash. Why? Because they got all this cash they\u0027re not declaring, got to keep the expenses in proportion. If they report thirty cents of every dollar goes through the register, that\u0027s a lot. And you know the frosting on the cake? Eight and a quarter percent sales tax on every sale, law says they have to collect it. But the seventy percent of sales they don\u0027t report, they can\u0027t exactly hand over the tax on that, can they? So it gets skimmed, too. Pure tax-free profit, every penny of it.\" \"Not just Greeks,\" Yuri said. \"No, but they got it down to a science. You were Greek, all you gotta do is hit twenty coffee shops. You don\u0027t think they all got fifty grand in the safe, or stuffed in the mattress, or under a loose board in the clothes closet? Hit twenty and you got your million.\" \"But I am not a Greek,\" Yuri said. Kenan asked him if he knew any diamond merchants. \"They have a lot of cash,\" he said. Peter said a lot of the jewelry business was markers, IOUs that passed back and forth. Kenan said there was still some cash in it somewhere, and Yuri said it didn\u0027t matter because he didn\u0027t know anyone in diamonds. I went into the other room and left them at it. I WANTED to call TJ and I got out the piece of paper with all the calls the Kongs had logged to Kenan\u0027s phone. I found the number of the laundromat pay phone but hesitated. Would TJ know to answer it? And would it compromise him if the place was crowded? And suppose Ray picked up the phone? That seemed unlikely, but- Then I remembered there was a simpler way. I could beep him and let him call me. I seemed to be having trouble adjusting to this new technology. I still automatically thought in more primitive terms.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-37.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
