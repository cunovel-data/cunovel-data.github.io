Kenan ordered a glass of wine and I asked for a Perrier. \"Nice place,\" he said. After we\u0027d ordered dinner he said, \"I don\u0027t know, man. I got no reason to be in the city. I just got in the car and drove around and I couldn\u0027t think of a single place to go. I used to do that all the time, just drive around, do my part for the oil shortage and the air pollution. You ever do that? Oh, how could you, you don\u0027t have a car. Suppose you want to get away for a weekend? What do you do?\" \"Rent one.\" \"Yeah, sure,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t think of that. You do that much?\" \"Fairly often when the weather\u0027s decent. My girlfriend and I go upstate, or over to Pennsylvania.\" \"Oh, you got a girlfriend, huh? I was wondering. Two of you been keeping company for a long time?\" \"Not too long.\" \"What\u0027s she do, if you don\u0027t mind my asking.\" \"She\u0027s an art historian.\" \"Very good,\" he said. \"Must be interesting.\" \"She seems to find it interesting.\" \"I mean she must be interesting. An interesting person.\" \"Very,\" I said. He was looking better this evening, his hair barbered and his face shaved, but there was still an air of weariness about him, with a current of restlessness moving beneath it. He said, \"I don\u0027t know what to do with myself. I sit around the house and it just makes me nuts. My wife\u0027s dead, my brother\u0027s doing God knows what, my business is going to hell, and I don\u0027t know what to do.\" \"What\u0027s the matter with your business?\" \"Maybe nothing, maybe everything. I set up something on this trip I just made. I got a shipment due sometime next week.\" \"Maybe you shouldn\u0027t tell me about it.\" \"You ever have opiated hash? If you were strictly a boozer you probably didn\u0027t.\" \"No.\" \"That\u0027s what I got coming in. Grown in eastern Turkey and coming our way via Cyprus, or so they tell me.\" \"What\u0027s the problem?\" \"The problem is I should have walked away from the deal. There are people in it I got no reason to trust, and I went in on it for the worst possible reason. I did it to have something to do.\" I said, \"I can work for you in the matter of your wife\u0027s death. I can do that irrespective of how you make your living, and I can even break a few laws on your behalf. But I can\u0027t work for you or with you as far as your profession is concerned.\" \"Petey told me that working for me would lead him back to using. Is that a factor for you?\" \"No.\" \"It\u0027s just something you wouldn\u0027t touch.\" \"I guess so, yes.\" He thought for a moment, then nodded. \"I can appreciate that,\" he said. \"I can respect it. On the one hand, I\u0027d like to have you with me because I\u0027d be confident with you backing my play. And it\u0027s very lucrative. You know that.\" \"Of course.\" \"But it\u0027s dirty, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m aware of it. How could I not be? It\u0027s a dirty business.\" \"So get out of it.\" \"I\u0027m thinking about it. I never figured to make it my life\u0027s work. I always figured another couple of years, a few more deals, a little more money in the offshore account. Familiar story, right? I wish they\u0027d just legalize it, make it simple for everybody.\" \"A cop said the same thing just the other day.\" \"Never happen. Or maybe it will. I\u0027ll tell you, I\u0027d welcome it.\" \"Then what would you do?\" \"Sell something else.\" He laughed. \"Guy I met this past trip, Lebanese like me, I hung out with him and his wife in Paris. \u0027Kenan,\u0027 he says, \u0027you got to get out of this business, it deadens your soul.\u0027 He wants me to throw in with him. You know what he does? He\u0027s an arms dealer, for Christ\u0027s sake, he sells weapons. \u0027Man,\u0027 I said, \u0027my customers just kill themselves with the product. Your customers kill other people.\u0027 \u0027Not the same,\u0027 he insisted. \u0027I deal with nice people, respectable people.\u0027 And he tells me all these important people he knows, CIA, secret services of other countries. So maybe I\u0027ll get out of the dope business and become a big-time merchant of death. You like that better?\" \"Is that your only choice?\" \"Serious? No, of course not. I could buy and sell anything. I don\u0027t know, my old man may have been slightly full of shit with the Phoenician business, but there\u0027s no question our people are traders all over the world. When I dropped out of college, first thing I did was travel. I went visiting relatives. The Lebanese are scattered all over the planet, man. I got an aunt and uncle in Yucatбn, I got cousins all through Central and South America. I went over to Africa, some relatives on my mother\u0027s side are in a country called Togo. I never heard of it until I went there. My relatives operate the black market for currency in Lomй, that\u0027s the capital of Togo. They\u0027ve got this suite of offices in a building in downtown Lomй. No sign in the lobby and you got to walk up a flight of stairs, but it\u0027s pretty much out in the open. All day long people are coming in with money to change, dollars, pounds, francs, traveler\u0027s checks. Gold, they buy and sell gold, weigh it and figure the price. \"All day long the money goes back and forth over the long table they got there. I couldn\u0027t believe how much money they handled. I was a kid, I never saw a lot of cash, and I\u0027m looking at tons of money. See, they only make like one or two percent on a transaction, but the volume is enormous. \"They lived in this walled compound on the edge of town. It had to be huge to accommodate all the servants. I\u0027m a kid from Bergen Street, I grew up sharing a room with my brother, and here are these cousins of mine and they\u0027ve got something like five servants for each member of the family. That\u0027s including children. No exaggeration. I was uncomfortable at first, I thought it was wasteful, but it was explained to me. If you were rich you had an obligation to employ a lot of people. You were creating jobs, you were doing something for the people. \" \u0027Stay,\u0027 they told me. They wanted to take me into the business. If I didn\u0027t like Togo, they had in-laws with the same kind of operation in Mali. \u0027But Togo\u0027s nicer,\u0027 they said.\" \"Could you still go?\" \"That\u0027s the sort of thing you do when you\u0027re twenty years old, start a new life in a new country.\" \"What are you, thirty-two?\" \"Thirty-three. That\u0027s a little old for an entry-level slot.\" \"You might not have to start in the mailroom.\" He shrugged. \"Funny thing is Francine and I discussed it. She had a problem with it because she was afraid of blacks. The idea of being one of a handful of white people in a black nation was frightening to her. She said, like, suppose they decide to take over? I said, honey, what\u0027s to take over? It\u0027s their country. They already own it. But she was not completely rational on the subject.\" His voice hardened. \"And look who she got in a truck with, look who killed her. White guys. All your life you fear one thing and something else sneaks up on you.\" His eyes locked with mine. \"It\u0027s like they didn\u0027t just kill her, they obliterated her. She ceased to exist. I didn\u0027t even see a body, I saw parts, chunks. I went to my cousin\u0027s clinic in the middle of the night and turned the chunks into ashes. She\u0027s gone and there\u0027s this hole in my life and I don\u0027t know what to put in it.\" \"They say time takes time,\" I said. \"It can take some of mine. I got time I don\u0027t know what to do with. I\u0027m alone in the house all day and I find myself talking to myself. Out loud, I mean.\" \"People do that when they\u0027re used to having somebody around. You\u0027ll get over it.\" \"Well, if I don\u0027t, so what? If I\u0027m talking to myself who\u0027s gonna hear me, right?\" He sipped from his water glass. \"Then there\u0027s sex,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know what the hell to do about sex. I have the desire, you know? I\u0027m a young guy, it\u0027s natural.\" \"A minute ago you were too old to start a new life in Africa.\" \"You know what I mean. I have desires and I not only don\u0027t know what to do about them, I don\u0027t feel right about having them. It feels disloyal to want to go to bed with a woman whether I actually do it or not. And who would I go to bed with if I wanted to? What am I gonna do, sweet-talk some woman in a bar? Go to a massage parlor, pay some cross-eyed Korean girl to get me off? Go out on fucking dates, take some woman to a movie, make conversation with her? I try to picture myself doing that and I figure I\u0027d rather stay home and jerk off, only I won\u0027t do that either because even that seems like it would be disloyal.\" He sat back abruptly, embarrassed. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to spout all this crap at you. I hadn\u0027t planned on saying any of that. I don\u0027t know where it came from.\" I CALLED my art historian when I got back to the hotel. She\u0027d had her class that night and wasn\u0027t back yet. I left a message on her machine and wondered if she would call. We\u0027d had a bad time of it a few nights before. After dinner we\u0027d rented a movie that she wanted to see and I didn\u0027t, and maybe I was bitter about that, I don\u0027t know. Whatever it was, there was something wrong between us. After the movie ended she made an off-color remark and I suggested she might make an effort to sound a little less like a whore. That would have been an acceptable rejoinder under ordinary circumstances, but I said it like I meant it and she said something suitably stinging in return. I apologized and so did she and we agreed it was nothing, but it didn\u0027t feel that way, and when it got to be time to go to bed we did so on opposite sides of town. When we spoke the next day we didn\u0027t say anything about it, and we still hadn\u0027t, and it hung in the air between us whenever we talked, and even when we didn\u0027t. She called me back around eleven-thirty. \"I just got in,\" she said. \"A couple of us went out for a drink after class. How was your day?\" \"All right,\" I said, and we talked about it for a few minutes. Then I asked if it was too late for me to drop over. \"Oh, gee,\" she said. \"I\u0027d like to see you, too.\" \"But it\u0027s too late.\" \"I think so, hon. I\u0027m wiped out and I just want to take a quick shower and pass out. Is that okay?\" \"Sure.\" \"Talk to you tomorrow?\" \"Uh-huh. Sleep well.\" I hung up and said, \"I love you,\" speaking to the empty room, hearing the words bounce off the walls. We had become quite adept at purging the phrase from our speech when we were together, and I listened to myself saying it now and wondered if it was true. I felt something but couldn\u0027t work out what it was. I took a shower and got out and dried off, and standing there looking at my face in the mirror over the bathroom sink I realized what it was I felt. There are two midnight meetings every night. The closest one was on West Forty-sixth Street and I got there just as they were beginning the meeting. I helped myself to a cup of coffee and sat down, and minutes later I was hearing a voice I recognized say, \"My name is Peter and I\u0027m an alcoholic and a drug addict.\" Good, I thought. \"And I have one day back,\" he said. Not so good. Tuesday he\u0027d had two days, today he had one. I thought about how difficult it must be, trying to get back in the lifeboat and not being able to get a grip on it. And then I stopped thinking about Peter Khoury because I was there for my own benefit, not for his.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-33.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
