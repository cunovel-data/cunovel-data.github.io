Their voices were close and their speech patterns were very similar and they finished each other\u0027s sentences a lot.\\n\\n They liked the idea of playing a role in a murder case- I hadn\u0027t gone into a great deal of detail- and they were amused at the response I\u0027d received from various functionaries at the telephone company. \"That\u0027s beautiful,\" Jimmy Hong said. \"Saying it can\u0027t be done. Meaning most likely that he couldn\u0027t figure out how to do it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s their system,\" David King said, \"and you\u0027d think they would at least understand it.\"\\n\\n \"But they don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"And they hate us, because we understand it better than they do.\"\\n\\n \"And they think we\u0027d hurt the system-\"\\n\\n \"- when actually we happen to love the system. Because if you\u0027re going to do any serious hacking, NYNEX is where it\u0027s at.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a beautiful system.\"\\n\\n \"Unbelievably complex.\"\\n\\n \"Wheels within wheels.\"\\n\\n \"Labyrinths within labyrinths.\"\\n\\n \"The ultimate video game, and the ultimate Dungeons and Dragons, all rolled into one.\"\\n\\n \"Cosmic.\"\\n\\n I said. \"But it can be done?\"\\n\\n \"What can? Oh, the numbers. Phone calls placed on a specific day to a specific number?\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"Be a problem,\" David King said.\\n\\n \"An interesting problem, he means.\"\\n\\n \"Right, very interesting. A problem with a solution for sure, a solvable problem.\"\\n\\n \"But a tricky one.\"\\n\\n \"Because of the amount of data.\"\\n\\n \"Tons of data,\" Jimmy Hong said. \"Millions and millions of pieces of data.\"\\n\\n \"By data he means phone calls.\"\\n\\n \"Billions of phone calls. Untold billions of phone calls.\"\\n\\n \"Which you have to process.\"\\n\\n \"But before you even start to do that-\"\\n\\n \"You have to get in.\"\\n\\n \"Which used to be easy.\"\\n\\n \"Used to be a cinch.\"\\n\\n \"They would leave the door open.\"\\n\\n \"Now they close it.\"\\n\\n \"Nail it shut, you could say.\"\\n\\n I said, \"If you need to buy special equipment-\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no. Not really.\"\\n\\n \"We already got everything we need.\"\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t take much. Halfway decent laptop, a modem, an acoustic coupler-\"\\n\\n \"Whole package won\u0027t run more than twelve hundred dollars.\"\\n\\n \"Unless you went crazy and bought a high-priced laptop, but you don\u0027t have to.\"\\n\\n \"The one we use cost seven-fifty, and it\u0027s got everything you need.\"\\n\\n \"So you could do it?\"\\n\\n They exchanged glances, then looked at me. Jimmy Hong said, \"Sure, we could do it.\"\\n\\n \"Be interesting, actually.\"\\n\\n \"Have to pull an all-nighter.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t be tonight, either.\"\\n\\n \"No, tonight\u0027s out. How soon would it have to be?\"\\n\\n \"Well-\"\\n\\n \"Tomorrow\u0027s Sunday. Sunday night all right with you, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s fine with me.\"\\n\\n \"You, Mr. King?\"\\n\\n \"Works for me, Mr. Hong.\"\\n\\n \"TJ? You figuring to be there?\"\\n\\n \"Tomorrow night?\" It was the first he\u0027d said anything since introducing me to the Kongs. \"Lessee, tomorrow night. What did I have planned for tomorrow night? Was that the press reception at Gracie Mansion or was I supposed to have dinner with Henry Kissinger at Windows on the World?\" He mimed paging through a date book, then looked up bright-eyed. \"What do you know? I be free.\"\\n\\n Jimmy Hong said, \"There\u0027ll be some expenses, Matt. We\u0027ll need a hotel room.\"\\n\\n \"I have a room.\"\\n\\n \"You mean where you live?\" They grinned at each other, amused at my naпvetй. \"No, what you want is someplace anonymous. See, we\u0027re going to be deep inside NYNEX-\"\\n\\n \"Crawling around inside the belly of the beast, you could say-\"\\n\\n \"- and we might leave footprints.\"\\n\\n \"Or fingerprints, if you prefer.\"\\n\\n \"Even voiceprints, speaking metaphorically, of course.\"\\n\\n \"So you don\u0027t want to do this from a phone that could be traced to anybody. What you want to do is rent a hotel room under a false name and pay cash for it.\"\\n\\n \"A reasonably decent one.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t have to be ritzy.\"\\n\\n \"Just so it has direct-dial phones.\"\\n\\n \"Which most of them do nowadays. And push-button, it should be push-button.\"\\n\\n \"Not the old rotary dial.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s easy enough,\" I said. \"Is that what you usually do? Rent a hotel room?\"\\n\\n They exchanged glances again.\\n\\n \"Because if there\u0027s a hotel you prefer-\"\\n\\n David said, \"The thing is, Matt, when we want to hack we don\u0027t generally have a hundred or a hundred and fifty bucks to spend on a decent hotel room.\"\\n\\n \"Or even seventy-five dollars for a crummy hotel room.\"\\n\\n \"Or fifty for a disgusting hotel room. So what we\u0027ll do-\"\\n\\n \"We find a bank of pay phones where there\u0027s not much traffic, like in the Grand Central waiting room over by the commuter lines-\"\\n\\n \"- because there\u0027s not many commuter trains leaving in the middle of the night-\"\\n\\n \"- or in an office building, anything like that.\"\\n\\n \"Or one time we sort of let ourselves into an office-\"\\n\\n \"Which was stupid, man, and I never want to do that again.\"\\n\\n \"We just did it to use the phone.\"\\n\\n \"And can you feature telling that to the cops? \u0027It\u0027s not burglary, Officer, we just dropped in to use the phones.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Well, it was exciting, but we wouldn\u0027t do it again. The thing is, see, we\u0027ll probably have to spend hours and hours on this-\"\\n\\n \"And you wouldn\u0027t want anybody walking in, or having to switch phones when we\u0027re all hooked up.\"\\n\\n \"No problem,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll get a decent hotel room. What else?\"\\n\\n \"Coke.\"\\n\\n \"Or Pepsi.\"\\n\\n \"Coke\u0027s better.\"\\n\\n \"Or Jolt. \u0027All the sugar and twice the caffeine.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Maybe some junk food. Maybe some Doritos.\"\\n\\n \"Get the ranch flavor, not the barbecue.\"\\n\\n \"Potato chips, Cheez Doodles-\"\\n\\n \"Oh, man, not Cheez Doodles!\"\\n\\n \"I like Cheez Doodles.\"\\n\\n \"Man, that has got to be the lamest junk food there is. I challenge you to name anything edible that is stupider than Cheez Doodles.\"\\n\\n \"Pringles.\"\\n\\n \"No fair! Pringles aren\u0027t food. Matt, you got to judge this one. What do you say? Are Pringles food?\"\\n\\n \"Well-\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re not! Hong, you are so sick. Pringles are tiny Frisbees that warped, that\u0027s all they are. They\u0027re not food.\"\\n\\n WHEN Kenan Khoury didn\u0027t answer I tried his brother. Peter\u0027s voice was thick with sleep and I apologized for waking him. \"I keep doing that,\" I said. \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"My own fault, nodding out in the middle of the afternoon. My sleep schedule got all turned around lately. What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"Not much. I was trying to reach Kenan.\"\\n\\n \"Still in Europe. He called me last night.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"Coming back Monday. Why, you got some good news to report?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet. I\u0027ve got some cabs I have to take.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"Expenses,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll have to shell out close to two thousand dollars tomorrow. I wanted to clear it with him.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, no problem. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll say yes. He said he\u0027d cover your expenses, didn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"So lay it out. He\u0027ll pay you back.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the problem,\" I said. \"My money\u0027s in the bank and it\u0027s Saturday.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you use an ATM?\"\\n\\n \"Not for a safe-deposit box. I can\u0027t get it all out of my checking account because I just paid the bills the other day.\"\\n\\n \"So write a check and cover it Monday.\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t the kind of expense where the people will take a check.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, right.\" There was a pause. \"I don\u0027t know what to tell you, Matt. I could come up with a couple of hundred, but I haven\u0027t got anything like two grand.\"\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t Kenan have it in the safe?\"\\n\\n \"Probably a lot more than that, but I can\u0027t get in there. You don\u0027t give a junkie the combination to your safe, not even if he\u0027s your brother. Not unless you\u0027re crazy.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not bitter,\" he said. \"I\u0027m just stating a fact. No reason on earth for me to have the combination to the safe. I got to tell you, I\u0027m glad I don\u0027t have it. I wouldn\u0027t trust myself with it.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re clean and sober now, Pete. What\u0027s it been, a year and a half?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m still a drunk and a junkie, man. You know the difference between the two? A drunk will steal your wallet.\"\\n\\n \"And a junkie?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, a junkie\u0027ll steal your wallet, too. And then he\u0027ll help you look for it.\"\\n\\n I ALMOST asked Pete if he wanted to go to that Chelsea meeting again, but something made me let the moment pass. Maybe I remembered that I wasn\u0027t his sponsor, and that it was not a position for which I wanted to volunteer.\\n\\n I called Elaine and asked her how she was fixed for cash. \"Come on over,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve got a house full of money.\"\\n\\n She had fifteen hundred in fifties and hundreds and said she could get more from the ATM, but no more than $500 a day. I took twelve hundred so I wouldn\u0027t leave her broke. That, added to what I had in my wallet and what I could get from my own ATM, would be plenty.\\n\\n I told her what I needed the money for and she thought the whole thing was fascinating. \"But is it safe?\" she wanted to know. \"It\u0027s obviously illegal, but how illegal is it?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s worse than jaywalking. Computer trespass is a felony, and so is computer tampering, and I have a feeling the Kongs will be committing both of them tomorrow night. I\u0027ll be aiding and abetting them, and I\u0027ve already committed criminal solicitation. I\u0027ll tell you, you can\u0027t turn around these days without trampling all over the penal law.\"\\n\\n \"But you think it\u0027s worth it?\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"Because they\u0027re just kids. You wouldn\u0027t want to get them in trouble.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t want to get myself in trouble, either. And they run this particular risk all the time. At least they\u0027re getting paid for it.\"\\n\\n \"How much are you going to give them?\"\\n\\n \"Five hundred apiece.\"\\n\\n She whistled. \"That\u0027s not bad for a night\u0027s work.\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s not, and if they\u0027d come up with a figure it would probably have been a lot less. They went blank when I asked them how much they wanted, so I suggested five hundred each. That seemed fine to them. They\u0027re middle-class kids, I don\u0027t think they\u0027re hurting for money. I have a feeling I could have talked them into doing the job for free.\"\\n\\n \"By appealing to their better nature.\"\\n\\n \"And their desire to be in on something exciting. But I didn\u0027t want to do that. Why shouldn\u0027t they have the dough? I\u0027d have been willing to pay more than that to some phone-company employee if I could have figured out who to bribe. But I couldn\u0027t find anybody who\u0027d admit what I wanted was technologically possible. Why not give it to the Kongs? It\u0027s not my money, and Kenan Khoury says you can always afford to be generous.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-20.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \\n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
