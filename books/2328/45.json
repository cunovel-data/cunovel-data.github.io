{"id":63770,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"\"You said a week,\" he said. \"You promised.\" THE money all seemed to be there. We filled one suitcase. The other was in the basement, and nobody much wanted to go get it. \"I\u0027d say for TJ to go,\" Kenan said, \"but I know how he got in the cemetery, so I guess it\u0027d spook him too much to go down there with a dead body.\" \"You just sayin\u0027 that so I\u0027ll go. Tryin\u0027 to psyche me out.\" \"Yeah,\" Kenan said. \"I figured you\u0027d say something like that.\" TJ rolled his eyes, then went for the suitcase. He came back with it and said, \"Man, it stinks pretty powerful down there. Dead people always smell that bad? I ever kill somebody, remind me to do it from a distance.\" It was curious. We worked around Callander, treating him as if he weren\u0027t there, and he made such treatment easier than it might have been by staying put and keeping his mouth shut. He looked smaller sitting there, and weak and ineffectual. I knew him to be none of those things, but his blank passivity gave that impression. \"All packed up,\" Kenan said, fastening the hasps of the second suitcase. \"Can go right back to Yuri.\" Peter said, \"All Yuri wanted was to get his kid back.\" \"Well, tonight\u0027s his lucky night. He gets the money, too.\" \"Said he didn\u0027t care about the money,\" Peter said dreamily. \"The money didn\u0027t matter.\" \"Petey, are you saying something without saying it?\" \"He don\u0027t know we came here.\" \"No.\" \"Just a thought.\" \"No.\" \"Whole lot of money, babe. And you been takin\u0027 a bath lately. That hash deal\u0027s gonna go down the tubes, isn\u0027t it?\" \"So?\" \"God gives you a chance to get even, you don\u0027t want to spit in His eye.\" \"Awww, Petey,\" Kenan said. \"Don\u0027t you remember what the old man told us?\" \"He told us all kinds of shit. When did we ever listen?\" \"He said never to steal unless you can steal a million dollars, Petey. Remember?\" \"Well, now\u0027s our chance.\" Kenan shook his head. \"No. Wrong. That\u0027s eight hundred thousand, and a quarter of a mil is counterfeit and another hundred and thirty thousand is mine to start with. So what\u0027s that leave? Four-something. Four-twenty? Something like that.\" \"Which gets you even, babe. Four hundred this asshole took off of you, plus ten you gave Matt, plus expenses, comes to what? Four-twenty? Goddamn close to it.\" \"I don\u0027t want to get even.\" \"Huh?\" He stared hard at his brother. \"I don\u0027t want to get even,\" he said. \"I paid blood money for Francey and you want me to steal blood money from Yuri. Man, you got that fucking junkie mind, steal his wallet and help him look for it.\" \"Yeah, you\u0027re right.\" \"I mean for Christ\u0027s sake, Petey-\" \"No, you\u0027re right. You\u0027re absolutely right.\" Callander said, \"You paid me with counterfeit money?\" \"You simple shit,\" Kenan said, \"I was beginning to forget you were here. What are you, afraid you\u0027ll get picked up trying to spend it? I got news for you. You ain\u0027t gonna spend it.\" \"You\u0027re the Arab. The husband.\" \"So?\" \"I was just wondering.\" I said, \"Ray, where\u0027s the money you got from Mr. Khoury? The four hundred thousand.\" \"We divided it.\" \"And what happened to it?\" \"I don\u0027t know what Albert did with his half. I know it\u0027s not in the house.\" \"And your half?\" \"Safe-deposit box. Brooklyn First Mercantile, New Utrecht and Fort Hamilton Parkway. I\u0027ll go there in the morning on my way out of town.\" Kenan said, \"You will, huh?\" \"I can\u0027t decide whether to take the Honda or the van,\" he went on. \"He\u0027s kind of spaced, isn\u0027t he? Matt, I think he\u0027s telling the truth about the dough. The half in the bank we can forget about. Albert\u0027s half, I don\u0027t know, we could turn the house upside down but I don\u0027t think we\u0027re gonna find it, do you?\" \"No.\" \"He probably buried it in the yard. Or in the fucking cemetery or someplace. Fuck it. I\u0027m not supposed to have that money. I knew that all along. Let\u0027s do what we gotta do and get outta here.\" I said, \"You have a choice to make, Kenan.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"I can take him in. There\u0027s a lot of hard evidence against him now. He\u0027s got his dead partner in the basement, and the van in the garage is going to be full of fibers and blood traces and God knows what else. Pam Cassidy can ID him as the man who maimed her. Other evidence will tie him to Leila Alvarez and Marie Gotteskind. He ought to be looking at three life sentences, plus an extra twenty or thirty years tacked on as a bonus.\" \"Can you guarantee he\u0027ll do life?\" \"No,\" I said. \"Nobody can guarantee anything when it comes to the criminal justice system. My best guess is that he\u0027ll wind up at the State Hospital for the Criminally Insane at Matteawan, and that he\u0027ll never leave the place alive. But anything could happen. You know that. I can\u0027t see him skating, but I\u0027ve said that about other people and they never did a day.\" He thought it over. \"Going back to our deal,\" he said. \"Our deal wasn\u0027t about you taking him in.\" \"I know. That\u0027s why I\u0027m saying it\u0027s your choice. But if you make the other choice I have to walk first.\" \"You don\u0027t want to be here for it.\" \"No.\" \" \u0027Cause you don\u0027t approve?\" \"I don\u0027t approve or disapprove.\" \"But it\u0027s not the kind of thing you would ever do.\" \"No,\" I said, \"that\u0027s not it at all. Because I have done it, I\u0027ve appointed myself executioner. It\u0027s not a role I\u0027d want to make a habit of.\" \"No.\" \"And there\u0027s no reason why I should in this case. I could turn him over to Brooklyn Homicide and sleep fine.\" He thought about it. \"I don\u0027t think I could,\" he said. \"That\u0027s why I said it has to be your decision.\" \"Yeah, well, I guess I just made it. I have to take care of it myself.\" \"Then I guess I\u0027ll be going.\" \"Yeah, you and everybody else,\" he said. \"Here\u0027s what we\u0027ll do. It\u0027s a shame we didn\u0027t bring two cars. Matt, you and TJ and Petey\u0027ll take the money to Yuri.\" \"Some of it\u0027s yours. Do you want to take out the money you lent him?\" \"Separate it out at his place, will you? I don\u0027t want to wind up with any of the counterfeit.\" \"It\u0027s all in the packages with the Chase wrappers,\" Peter said. \"Yeah, except it all got mixed around when this dickhead here counted it, so check it out at Yuri\u0027s, okay? And then you\u0027ll pick me up. Figure what? Twenty minutes to Yuri\u0027s and twenty minutes back, twenty minutes there, figure an hour. You\u0027ll come back here and pick me up on the corner an hour and fifteen minutes from now.\" \"All right.\" He grabbed a bag. \"C\u0027mon,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll take these out to the car. Matt, watch him, huh?\" They left, and TJ and I stood looking down at Raymond Callander. We both had guns, but either of us could have guarded him with a flyswatter at this point. He seemed barely present. I looked at him and remembered our conversation in the cemetery, that minute or two when something human had been talking. I wanted to talk to him again and see what would come out this time. I said, \"Were you just going to leave Albert there?\" \"Albert?\" He had to think about it. \"No,\" he said at length. \"I was going to tidy up before I left.\" \"What would you do with him?\" \"Cut him up. Wrap him. There\u0027s plenty of Hefty bags in the cupboard.\" \"And then what? Deliver him to somebody in the trunk of the car?\" \"Oh,\" he said, remembering. \"No, that was for the Arab\u0027s benefit. But it\u0027s easy. You spread them around, put them in dumpsters, trash cans. No one ever notices. Put them in with restaurant garbage and they just pass as meat scraps.\" \"You\u0027ve done this before.\" \"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"There were more women then you know about.\" He looked at TJ. \"One black one I remember. She was just about your color.\" He heaved a sigh. \"I\u0027m tired,\" he said. \"It won\u0027t be long.\" \"You\u0027re going to leave me with him,\" he said, \"and he\u0027s going to kill me. That Arab.\" Phoenician, I thought. \"You and I know each other,\" he said. \"I know you lied to me, I know you broke your promise, that was what you had to do. But you and I had a conversation. How can you just let him kill me?\" Whining, querulous. It was impossible not to think of Eichmann in the dock in Israel. How could we do this to him? And I thought, too, of a question I had asked him in the graveyard, and I fed his own remarkable answer back to him. \"You got in the truck,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"Once you got in the truck,\" I said, \"you\u0027re just body parts.\" WE picked up Kenan as arranged at a quarter to three in the morning in front of a credit jeweler on Eighth Avenue, just around the corner from Albert Wallens\u0027s house. He saw me behind the wheel and asked where his brother was. I said we\u0027d dropped him off a few minutes ago at the house on Colonial Road. He was going to pick up the Toyota, but changed his mind and said he\u0027d go straight to sleep. \"Yeah? Me, I\u0027m so wired you\u0027d have to hit me over the head with a mallet to put me out. No, stay there, Matt. You drive.\" He walked around the car, looked in back at TJ, sprawled across the rear seat like a rag doll. \"Past his bedtime,\" he said. \"That flight bag looks familiar, but I hope it\u0027s not full of counterfeit money this time.\" \"It\u0027s your hundred and thirty thousand. We did our best. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any schlock mixed in.\" \"If there is it\u0027s no big deal. It\u0027s just about as good as the real stuff. Your best bet\u0027s the Gowanus. You know how to get back on it?\" \"I think so.\" \"And then the bridge or the tunnel, up to you. My brother offer to take my money into the house with him, keep an eye on it for me?\" \"I felt it was part of my job to deliver it personally.\" \"Yeah, well, that\u0027s a diplomatic way to put it. I wish I could take back one thing I said to him, telling him he had a junkie mind. That\u0027s a hell of a thing to say to a person.\" \"He agreed with you.\" \"That\u0027s the worst thing about it, we both of us know it\u0027s true. Yuri surprised to see the money?\" \"Astonished.\" He laughed. \"I\u0027ll bet. How\u0027s his kid?\" \"The doctor says she\u0027ll be all right.\" \"They hurt her bad, didn\u0027t they?\" \"I gather it\u0027s hard to separate the physical damage from the emotional trauma. They raped her repeatedly and I understand she sustained some internal injuries besides losing the two fingers. She was sedated, of course. And I think the doctor gave Yuri something.\" \"He should give us all something.\" \"Yuri tried to, as a matter of fact. He wanted to give me some money.\" \"I hope you took it.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-45.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
