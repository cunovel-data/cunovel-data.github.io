This one, Kali- what do you figure she was on?\"\\n\\n \"No idea.\"\\n\\n \"Because she certainly seemed to be traveling in another realm. Do people still use psychedelics? She was probably on magic mushrooms, or some hallucinogenic fungus that grows only on decaying leather. I\u0027ll tell you one thing, she could make good money as a dominatrix.\"\\n\\n \"Not if her leather\u0027s decaying. And not unless she could keep her mind on her work.\"\\n\\n \"You know what I mean. She\u0027s got the looks for it, and the presence. Can\u0027t you see yourself groveling at her feet and loving every minute of it?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you,\" she said. \"The Marquis de Suave himself. Remember the time I tied you up?\"\\n\\n The driver was working hard at hiding his amusement. \"Would you please shut up,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Remember? You fell asleep.\"\\n\\n \"That shows how safe I felt in your presence,\" I said. \"Will you please shut up?\"\\n\\n \"I will wrap myself in my teal-blue aura,\" she said, \"and I will be very quiet.\"\\n\\n BEFORE I left the following morning she told me she had a good feeling about the calls from rape victims. \"Today\u0027s the day,\" she said.\\n\\n But she turned out to be wrong, teal-blue aura or not. There were no calls at all. When I talked to her that night she was glum about it. \"I guess that\u0027s it,\" she said. \"Three Wednesday, one yesterday, and now nothing. I thought I was going to be a hero, come up with something significant.\"\\n\\n \"Ninety-eight percent of an investigation is insignificant,\" I said. \"You do everything you can think of because you don\u0027t know what will be useful. You must have been sensational on the phone because you got a very big response, but it\u0027s pointless to feel like a failure because you didn\u0027t turn up a living victim of the three stooges. You were looking for a needle in a haystack, and it\u0027s probably a haystack that didn\u0027t have a needle in it in the first place.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"I mean they probably didn\u0027t leave any witnesses. They probably killed every woman they victimized, so you were probably trying to find a woman who doesn\u0027t exist.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if she doesn\u0027t exist,\" she said, \"then I say to hell with her.\"\\n\\n TJ WAS calling in every day, sometimes more than once a day. I had given him fifty dollars to check out the two Brooklyn phones, and he couldn\u0027t have come out very far ahead on the deal, because what he hadn\u0027t spent on subways and buses he was sinking into telephone calls. He got a better return on his time shilling for monte dealers or assisting a street peddler or doing any of the other street chores that combined to give him an income. But he still kept pestering me for work.\\n\\n Saturday I wrote out a check for my rent and paid the other monthly bills that had come in- the phone bill, my credit card. Looking at the telephone bill made me think again of the calls made to Kenan Khoury\u0027s phone. I had made another attempt a few days before to find a phone-company employee who could figure out a way to supply that data, and had been told once again that it was unobtainable.\\n\\n So that was on my mind when TJ called around ten-thirty. \"Give me some more phones to check out,\" he pleaded. \"The Bronx, Staten Island, anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what you can do for me,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll give you a number and you tell me who called it.\"\\n\\n \"Say what?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, nothing.\"\\n\\n \"No, you said somethin\u0027, man. Tell me what it was.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you could do it at that,\" I said. \"Remember how you sweet-talked the operator out of the phone number on Farragut Road?\"\\n\\n \"You mean with my Brooks Brothers voice?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it. Maybe you could use the same voice to find some phone company vice president who can figure out how to come up with a listing of calls to a certain number in Bay Ridge.\" He asked a few more questions and I explained what I was looking for and why I was unable to find it.\\n\\n \"Hang on,\" he said. \"You sayin\u0027 they won\u0027t give it to you?\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t have it to give. They\u0027ve got all the calls logged but there\u0027s no way to sort them.\"\\n\\n \"Shit,\" he said. \"First operator I call up, she tell me ain\u0027t no way she can tell me my number. Can\u0027t believe everything they tell you, man.\"\\n\\n \"No, I-\"\\n\\n \"You somethin\u0027,\" he said. \"Call you up every damn day, say what you got for TJ, an\u0027 all the time you ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027. How come you never tell me \u0027bout this before? You been silly, Willie!\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"I mean if you don\u0027t tell me what you want, how I gonna give it to you? Told you that the first time I met you, walkin\u0027 around the Deuce not sayin\u0027 nothin\u0027 to nobody. Told you right then, said, tell me what you jonesin\u0027 on, I help you find it.\"\\n\\n \"I remember.\"\\n\\n \"So why you be dickin\u0027 around with the telephone company when you could be comin\u0027 to TJ?\"\\n\\n \"You mean you know how to get the numbers from the phone company?\"\\n\\n \"No, man. But I know how to get the Kongs.\"\\n\\n \"THE Kongs,\" he said. \"Jimmy and David.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re brothers?\"\\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t no family resemblance far as I can see. Jimmy Hong is Chinese and David King is Jewish. Least his father is Jewish. I think his mother might be Rican.\"\\n\\n \"Why are they the Kongs?\"\\n\\n \"Jimmy Hong and David King? Hong Kong and King Kong?\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"Plus their favorite game used to be Donkey Kong.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that, a video game?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"Pretty good one.\"\\n\\n We were at a snack bar in the bus terminal, where he\u0027d insisted I meet him. I was drinking a cup of bad coffee and he was eating a hot dog and drinking a Pepsi. He said, \"Remember that dude Socks, we was watchin\u0027 him at the arcade? He \u0027bout the best there is, but he ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 next to the Kongs. You know how a player is always tryin\u0027 to keep up with the machine? Kongs didn\u0027t have to keep up with it. They was always out ahead of it.\"\\n\\n \"You brought me down here to meet a couple of pinball wizards?\"\\n\\n \"Big difference between pinball and video games, man.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I suppose there is, but-\"\\n\\n \"But it ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 compared to the difference between video games an\u0027 where the Kongs is at now. I told you what happens to guys hang around the arcade, how you can get so good an\u0027 then there ain\u0027t no better for you to get? So you lose interest.\"\\n\\n \"So you said.\"\\n\\n \"What some dudes get interested in is computers. What I heard, the Kongs was into computers all along, fact they used a computer to stay ahead of the video games, know what the machine was gonna do before it could do it. You play chess?\"\\n\\n \"I know the moves.\"\\n\\n \"You an\u0027 me\u0027ll play a game sometime, see if you any good. You know those stone tables they got down by Washington Square? People bring their time clocks, study chess books while they waitin\u0027 to play? I play there sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"You must be good.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"Some of those dudes,\" he said, \"you play against them, it\u0027s like you tryin\u0027 to run a footrace standin\u0027 in water up to your waist. You can\u0027t get nowhere, \u0027cause they always five, six moves ahead of you in their mind.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes it feels like that in my line of work.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah? Well, that\u0027s how video games got for the Kongs, they was five or six moves out in front. So they into computers, they what you call hackers. You know what that is?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard the term.\"\\n\\n \"Man, you want something from the phone company, you don\u0027t call no operator. Don\u0027t mess with no vice president, either. You call the Kongs. They get in the phones and crawl around in there, like the phone company\u0027s a monster and they swimmin\u0027 in its bloodstream. You know that picture, whatchacallit, Fantastic Voyage? They take a voyage in the phones.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"If an executive at the company can\u0027t figure out how to extract that data-\"\\n\\n \"Man, ain\u0027t you listenin\u0027?\" He sighed, then sucked hard on his straw and drained the last of his Pepsi. \"You want to know what\u0027s happenin\u0027 on the streets, what\u0027s goin\u0027 down on the Deuce or in the Barrio or in Harlem, who do you go and ask? The fuckin\u0027 mayor?\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You see what I sayin\u0027? They hangin\u0027 out on the streets of the phone company. You know Ma Bell? The Kongs be lookin\u0027 up her skirt.\"\\n\\n \"Where are we going to find them? The arcade?\"\\n\\n \"Told you. They lost interest some time ago. They come by once in a while just to see what\u0027s shakin\u0027, but they don\u0027t hang out there no more. We ain\u0027t gonna find them. They gonna find us. I told \u0027em we\u0027d be here.\"\\n\\n \"How did you reach them?\"\\n\\n \"How you think? Beeped \u0027em. Kongs ain\u0027t never too far from a phone. You know, that hot dog was good. You wouldn\u0027t think you\u0027d get anything decent, place like this, but they give you a good hot dog.\"\\n\\n \"Does that mean you want another?\"\\n\\n \"Might as well. Take \u0027em some time to get here, and then they want to look you over before they come an\u0027 meet you. Want to satisfy themselves that you alone and that they can split in a hot second if they scared of you.\"\\n\\n \"Why would they be scared of me?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Cause you might be some kind of cop workin\u0027 for the phone company. Man, the Kongs is outlaws! Ma Bell ever gets her hands on them, she gone whip their ass.\"\\n\\n \"THE thing is,\" Jimmy Hong said, \"we have to be careful. People in suits are convinced that hackers are the biggest threat to corporate America since the Yellow Peril. The media is always running stories about what hackers could do to the system if we wanted to.\"\\n\\n \"Destroying data,\" David King said. \"Altering records. Wiping out circuitry.\"\\n\\n \"It makes a good story, but they lose sight of the fact that we never pull that shit. They think we\u0027re going to put dynamite on the railroad tracks when all we\u0027re doing is hitching a free ride.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, every once in a while some nitwit introduces a virus-\"\\n\\n \"But most of that isn\u0027t hackers, it\u0027s some jerk with a grudge against a company or somebody introducing a glitch into the system by using bootleg software.\"\\n\\n \"The point is,\" David said, \"Jimmy\u0027s too old to take chances.\"\\n\\n \"Turned eighteen last month,\" Jimmy Hong said.\\n\\n \"So if they catch us he\u0027ll be tried as an adult. That\u0027s if they go by chronological age, but if they take emotional maturity into account-\"\\n\\n \"Then David would go scot-free,\" Jimmy said, \"because he hasn\u0027t reached the age of reason.\"\\n\\n \"Which came between the Stone Age and the Iron Age.\"\\n\\n Once they decided they trusted you, you couldn\u0027t get them to shut up. Jimmy Hong was around six-two, long and lean, with straight black hair and a long, saturnine face. He wore aviator sunglasses with amber lenses, and after we\u0027d been sitting together for ten or fifteen minutes he changed them for a pair of horn-rimmed glasses with round untinted lenses, altering his appearance from hip to studious.\\n\\n David King was no more than five-seven, with a round face and red hair and a lot of freckles. Both of them wore Mets warmup jackets and chinos and Reeboks, but the similarity of dress wasn\u0027t enough to make them look like twins. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-19.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \\n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
