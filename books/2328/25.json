{"id":63739,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"He got out of the truck, explaining that maybe he had the name of the place wrong, that it was on the invoice, and she went around with him to the rear of the truck. He opened the back of the truck, and there was another man inside, and they both had knives. They made her get in the back of the truck with the second man, and the driver got back in the truck and drove off.\n AT this point I interrupted her, wanting to know why she had been so obliging about getting in the truck. Had there been people around? Had anyone witnessed the abduction?\n \"I\u0027m a little hazy on the details,\" she said.\n \"That\u0027s all right.\"\n \"It happened so quick.\"\n Elaine said, \"Pam, could I ask you a question?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"You\u0027re in the game, aren\u0027t you, dear?\"\n I thought, Jesus, how did I miss that?\n \"I don\u0027t know what you mean,\" Pam said.\n \"You were working that night, weren\u0027t you?\"\n \"How did you know?\"\n Elaine took the girl\u0027s hand. \"It\u0027s all right,\" she said. \"Nobody\u0027s going to hurt you, nobody\u0027s here to judge you. It\u0027s all right.\"\n \"But how did you-\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s a popular stroll, isn\u0027t it, that stretch of Park Avenue South? But I guess I knew earlier. Honey, I was never on the pavement, but I\u0027ve been in the game myself for almost twenty years.\"\n \"No!\"\n \"Honestly. Right in this apartment, which I bought when it went co-op. I\u0027ve learned to call them clients instead of tricks, and when I\u0027m around squares I sometimes say I\u0027m an art historian, and I\u0027ve been real smart about saving my pennies over the years, but I\u0027m in the life the same as you, dear. So you can tell it to us the way it really happened.\"\n \"God,\" she said. \"Actually, you know something? It\u0027s a relief. Because I didn\u0027t want to come here and tell you a story, you know? But I didn\u0027t think I had any choice.\"\n \"Because you thought we\u0027d disapprove of you?\"\n \"I guess. And because of what I told the cops.\"\n \"The cops didn\u0027t know you were hooking?\" I asked.\n \"No.\"\n \"They never even brought it up? With the pickup taking place right on the stroll?\"\n \"They were Queens cops,\" she said.\n \"Why would Queens cops catch the case?\"\n \"Because of where I wound up. I was in Elmhurst General Hospital, that\u0027s in Queens, so that\u0027s where the cops were from. What do they know about Park Avenue South?\"\n \"Why did you wind up at Elmhurst General? Never mind, you\u0027ll get to that. Why don\u0027t you start over from the beginning?\"\n \"Sure,\" she said.\n IT was a summery evening in the middle of the week. She was two blocks from her house, standing on the corner of Park and Twenty-sixth waiting for someone to hit on her, and this truck pulled up and a guy motioned for her to come over. She walked around and got in on the passenger side and he drove a block or two and turned on one of the side streets and parked at a hydrant.\n She thought it would be a quick blow-job while he sat behind the wheel, twenty or twenty-five for maybe five minutes. The guys in cars almost always wanted head and they wanted to be done right there in their cars. Sometimes they wanted it while the car was moving, which seemed crazy to her, but go figure. The johns who came around on foot would generally spring for a hotel room, and the Elton at Twenty-sixth and Park was reasonable and convenient for that. There was always her apartment, but she almost never took anybody back there unless she was desperate, because she didn\u0027t believe it was safe. Besides, who wanted to trick in the bed you slept in?\n She never saw the guy in the back until the truck was parked. Never even knew he was there until his arm came around her neck and his hand clapped over her mouth.\n He said, \"Surprise, Pammy!\"\n God, she was scared. She just froze while the driver laughed and reached into her blouse and started feeling her tits. She had big tits and she\u0027d learned to dress to show them on the street, in a halter top or a revealing blouse, because guys who went for tits really went for them, so you might as well show the merchandise. He went right for the nipple and tweaked it and it hurt and she knew these two were going to be rough.\n \"We\u0027ll all get in back,\" the driver said. \"More privacy, room to stretch out. We might as well be comfortable, right, Pammy?\"\n She hated the way they said her name. She had introduced herself as Pam, not Pammy, and they said it in a mocking way, a very nasty way.\n When the guy in back let go of her mouth she said, \"Look, nothing rough, huh? Whatever you want, and I\u0027ll give you a real good time, but no rough stuff, okay?\"\n \"You on drugs, Pammy?\"\n She said no, because she wasn\u0027t. She didn\u0027t care for drugs much. She would smoke a joint if somebody handed it to her, and coke was nice but she never yet actually bought any. Sometimes guys would lay out lines for her, and they got insulted if you weren\u0027t interested, and anyway she liked it well enough. Maybe they thought it got her hot, made her more into it, like sometimes you would get a guy who would put a dab of coke on his dick, like that would be such a treat for you when you went down on him that he\u0027d get extra good head on account of it.\n \"You a junkie, Pammy? Where do you fix, up your nose? Between your toes? You know any big drug dealers? You got a boyfriend deals junk, maybe?\"\n Really stupid questions. Like there was no purpose to them, like they more or less got off on asking the questions. The one did, anyway. The driver. He was the one all hipped on the subject of drugs. The other one was more into calling her names. \"You dirty cunt, you fucking piece-of-shit bitch,\" like that. Sickening if you let it get to you but actually a lot of guys were like that, especially when they got excited. One guy, she must have done him four, five times, always in his car, and he was always very polite before and after, very considerate, never rough, but it was always the same story when she was copping his joint and he was getting close to getting off. \"Oh, you cunt, you cunt, I wish you were dead. Oh, I wish you would die, I wish you were dead, you fucking cunt.\" Horrible, just horrible, but except for that he was a perfect gentleman and he paid fifty dollars each time and never took long to come, so what was the big deal if he had a nasty mouth? Sticks and stones, right?\n They went in the back of the truck and it was all fixed up with a mattress, which made it comfortable, actually, or it would have been comfortable if she could have relaxed, but you couldn\u0027t, not with these guys, because they were too weird. How could you relax?\n They made her take everything off, every stitch, which was a pain in the ass but she knew not to argue. And then, well, they fucked her, taking turns, first the driver, then the other one. That part was pretty much routine, except of course that there were the two of them, and when the second man was doing her the driver pinched her nipples. That hurt, but she knew better than to say anything, and anyway she knew he was aware that it hurt. That was why he was doing it.\n They both did her and they both got off, which was encouraging, because it was when a guy couldn\u0027t get it up or couldn\u0027t finish that you were sometimes in danger, because they got mad at you, like it was your fault. After the second one groaned and rolled off of her she said, \"Hey, that was great. You guys are all right. Let me get dressed, huh?\"\n That was when they showed her the knife.\n A switchblade, a big one, really skanky-looking. The second man, the one with the dirty mouth, had the knife, and he said, \"You ain\u0027t going nowhere, you fucking cunt.\"\n And Ray said, \"We\u0027re all going somewhere, we\u0027re going for a little ride, Pammy.\"\n That was his name, Ray. The other one called him Ray, that\u0027s how she knew it. The other one\u0027s name, if she heard it then it never registered, because she didn\u0027t have a clue. But the driver was Ray.\n Except they switched, so he wasn\u0027t the driver now. The other one climbed over the seat and got behind the wheel and Ray stayed in back with her, and he kept the knife, and of course he didn\u0027t let her put on her clothes.\n This was where it started getting really hard to remember. She was in the back of the truck and it was dark and she couldn\u0027t see out and they drove and drove and she didn\u0027t have any idea where they were or where they were going. Ray asked her about drugs again, he was hipped on the subject, he told her junkies were just looking to die, that it was a death trip, and that they should all get what they were looking for.\n He made her go down on him. That was better, at least he would shut up, and at least she was, like, doing something.\n Then they were parked again, God knows where, and then there was a lot of sex. They took turns with her and they just did stuff for a long time, and she was like zoning in and out, like she wasn\u0027t really a hundred percent there for part of the time. She was pretty sure that neither of them came. They both got off the first time, on Twenty-fourth Street or wherever it was, but now it was like they didn\u0027t want to come because that would break up the party. They did it to her in, well, all the usual places, and they put other things inside her besides parts of themselves. She wasn\u0027t really too clear on what they used. Some of what they did hurt and some didn\u0027t and it was awful, it was all terrible, and then she remembered something, she hadn\u0027t remembered this before, but there was a point where she got really peaceful.\n Because, see, she knew she was going to die. And it\u0027s not like she wanted to die, because she didn\u0027t, she definitely didn\u0027t, but the thought somehow came to her that that\u0027s what was going to happen, and that was all that was going to happen, and she thought, well, like I can handle that. Like I can live with it, almost, which was ridiculous because that was the point, she couldn\u0027t live, not if she died.\n \"Okay, I can handle that.\" Just like that, really.\n And then, just as she had really come to terms with it, just as she was enjoying this feeling of peacefulness, Ray said, \"You know what, Pammy? You\u0027re going to get a chance. We\u0027re going to let you live.\"\n The two of them argued then, because the other man wanted to kill her, but Ray said they could let her go, that she was a whore, that nobody cared about whores.\n But she wasn\u0027t just any whore, he said. She had the best set of tits on the street. He said, \"Do you like \u0027em, Pammy? Are you proud of them?\"\n She didn\u0027t know what she was supposed to say.\n \"Which one\u0027s your favorite? Come on, eeny meeny miney mo, pick one. Pammy. Pam-mee\"- singsong, like a taunting child- \"pick a titty, Pammy. Which one\u0027s your favorite?\"\n And he had something in his hand, sort of a loop of wire, coppery in the dim light.\n \"Pick the one you want to keep, Pammy. One for you and one for me, that\u0027s fair, isn\u0027t it, Pam-mee? You can keep one and I\u0027ll take the other one, and it\u0027s your choice, Pam-mee, you have to choose, you hot little bitch, you have to pick one. It\u0027s Pammy\u0027s choice, you remember Sophie\u0027s Choice, but that was tots and this is tits, Pam-mee, and you better pick one or I\u0027ll take them both.\"\n God, he was crazy, and what was she supposed to do, how could she pick one breast? There had to be a way to win this game but she couldn\u0027t think what it was.\n \"Look at that, look at that, I touch them and the nipples get hard, you get hot even when you\u0027re scared, even when you\u0027re crying, you little cunt, you. Pick one, Pammy. Which one will it be? This one? This one? What are you waiting for, Pammy? Are you trying to stall? Are you trying to make me angry? Come on, Pammy. Come on. Touch the one you want to keep.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-25.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: \n A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
