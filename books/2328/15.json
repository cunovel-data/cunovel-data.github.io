{"id":63719,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"ONCE I got the hang of it, I was able to go through the weeks with fair speed. I didn\u0027t have to scan an entire paper, just the Metropolitan section, where the local crime news was concentrated. The biggest time waster was the same one I always have in a library, which is a tendency to get sidetracked by something interesting that has nothing to do with what brought me there. Fortunately they don\u0027t carry comics in the Times. Otherwise I\u0027d have had to wrestle with the temptation to wallow in six months\u0027 worth of Doonesbury.\n By the time I got out of there I had half a dozen possible cases jotted down in my notebook. One was particularly likely, the victim an accounting major at Brooklyn College who went missing three days before a birdwatcher encountered her one morning in Green-Wood Cemetery. The story said that she\u0027d been subjected to sexual assault and sexual mutilation, which suggested to me that someone had done a job on her with a carving knife. Evidence at the scene indicated that she had been killed elsewhere and dumped at the cemetery, and police had drawn a similar conclusion about Marie Gotteskind, that she had already been dead when her killers discarded her body on the Forest Park Golf course.\n I got back to my hotel around six. There were messages from Elaine and both Khourys, along with three slips announcing simply that TJ had called.\n I called Elaine first and she reported that she\u0027d made all the calls. \"By the end I was beginning to believe my own cover story,\" she said. \"I was thinking to myself, This is fun, but it\u0027ll be even more fun when we make the movie. Except there\u0027s not going to be a movie.\"\n \"I think somebody already made it.\"\n \"I wonder if anybody will actually call.\"\n I got Kenan Khoury and he wanted to know how things were coming along. I told him I had managed to open up several lines of inquiry, but that I didn\u0027t expect quick results.\n \"But you think we got a shot,\" he said.\n \"Definitely.\"\n \"Good,\" he said. \"Listen, why I called, I\u0027m going to be out of the country on business for a couple of days. I have to go to Europe. I\u0027m flying out tomorrow from JFK and I\u0027ll be coming back Thursday or Friday. Anything comes up, just call my brother. You\u0027ve got his phone number, don\u0027t you?\"\n I had it on a message slip right in front of me, and I called it after I got off the phone with Kenan. Peter sounded groggy when he answered and I apologized for waking him. He said, \"No, that\u0027s okay, I\u0027m glad you did. I was watching basketball and I dozed off in front of the set. I hate when that happens, I always wind up with a stiff neck. Reason I called, I was wondering if you were planning to go to a meeting tonight.\"\n \"I thought I would, yes.\"\n \"Well, how about if I pick you up and we go together? There\u0027s a Saturday night meeting in Chelsea I got in the habit of going to, nice little group, meets at eight o\u0027clock in the Spanish church on Nineteenth Street.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I know it.\"\n \"It\u0027s a little out of the way, but when I first got sober I was in an outpatient program in that neighborhood and this became my regular Saturday meeting. I don\u0027t get down there as much these days but having the car and all, you know I\u0027ve got Francine\u0027s Toyota-\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"So suppose I pick you up in front of your hotel around seven-thirty? That sound good?\"\n I said it sounded fine, and when I left the hotel at seven-thirty he was parked out in front. I was just as glad I didn\u0027t have to walk anywhere. It had been drizzling on and off during the afternoon, and now it was coming down steadily.\n On the way to the meeting we talked about sports. The baseball teams were a month into spring training, with the season opener less than a month away. I\u0027d been having a little trouble getting interested this spring, although I would probably get caught up in it once they got going. For the time being, though, most of the news was about contract negotiations, with one player sulking because he knew he was worth more than $83 million a year. I don\u0027t know, maybe he\u0027s worth it, maybe they\u0027re all worth it, but it makes it hard for me to give a damn whether they win or lose.\n \"I think Darryl\u0027s finally ready to dig in and play,\" Peter said. \"He\u0027s been hitting a ton the past few weeks.\"\n \"Now that we don\u0027t have him anymore.\"\n \"Always the way it is, huh? Years we spend waiting for him to reach his full potential, and we got to see him do it in a Dodger uniform.\"\n We parked on Twentieth Street and walked around the block to the church. It was Pentecostal, and held services in both Spanish and English. The meeting was in the basement, with perhaps forty people in attendance. I saw a few faces I recognized from other meetings around town, and Pete said hello to quite a few people, one of whom said she hadn\u0027t seen him in a while. He said he\u0027d been going to other meetings.\n The format was one you didn\u0027t encounter that often in New York. After the speaker told his story, the meeting broke up into small groups, with seven to ten people sitting around each of five tables. There was a table for beginners, one for general discussion, one to discuss one of the Twelve Steps, and I forget what else. Pete and I both wound up at the general discussion table, where people tended to talk about what was going on in their lives at the moment and how they were managing to stay sober. I usually seem to get more out of that than discussion that centers around a topic, or on one of the philosophical underpinnings of the program.\n One woman had recently started work as an alcoholism counselor, and she talked about how it was difficult for her to retain her enthusiasm for meetings after spending eight hours dealing with the same issues at her job. \"It\u0027s hard to keep it separate,\" she said. A man talked about the fact that he had just been diagnosed as HIV-positive, and how he was dealing with that. I talked about the cyclical nature of my work, and how I grew restless when I went too long between jobs and put myself under too much pressure when a job did come along. \"It was easy to balance things out when I drank,\" I said, \"but I can\u0027t do that anymore. Meetings help.\"\n Pete talked when it was his turn, mostly commenting on some points other people had made. He didn\u0027t say much about himself.\n At ten o\u0027clock we stood in a big circle and held hands and said the prayer. Outside, the rain had softened some. We walked to the Camry and he asked if I was hungry. I realized that I was. I hadn\u0027t had dinner, just a slice of pizza on the way home from the library.\n \"You like Middle Eastern food, Matt? I don\u0027t mean your hole-in-the-wall falafel stand, I mean the real thing. Because there\u0027s a place in the Village that\u0027s really good.\" I said it sounded fine. \"Or you know what we could do, we could take a run out to the old neighborhood. Unless you spent so much time on Atlantic Avenue lately that you\u0027re sick of it.\"\n \"It\u0027s out of the way, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"Hey, we got a car, right? We got it, we might as well get some use out of it.\"\n He took the Brooklyn Bridge. I was thinking that it was beautiful in the rain, and he said, \"I love this bridge. I was reading the other day how all the bridges are deteriorating. You can\u0027t just leave a bridge alone, you got to maintain it, and the city does, but not sufficiently.\"\n \"There\u0027s no money.\"\n \"How did that happen? For years the city could afford to do whatever it had to do, and now all the time there\u0027s no money. Why is that, do you happen to know?\"\n I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s just New York. It\u0027s the same story everywhere.\"\n \"Is it? Because all I see is New York, and it\u0027s like the city is crumbling. The whadayacallit, the infrastructure? Is that the word I want?\"\n \"I guess.\"\n \"The infrastructure\u0027s falling apart. There was another water main break last month. What it is, the system is old and everything\u0027s wearing out. Who ever heard of water mains bursting ten, twenty years ago? Do you remember that sort of thing happening?\"\n \"No, but that doesn\u0027t mean it didn\u0027t happen. Lots of things happened that I didn\u0027t notice.\"\n \"Yeah, well, you got a point. That would go for me, too. Lots of things still happen that I don\u0027t notice.\"\n The restaurant he chose was on Court half a block from Atlantic. At his suggestion I had the spinach pie appetizer, which he assured me would be entirely different from the spanakopita they served in Greek coffee shops. He was right. The main course, a casserole of cracked wheat and sauteed chopped meat and onions, was also excellent, but too much for me to finish.\n \"So you can take it home,\" he said. \"You like this place? Nothing fancy, but you can\u0027t beat the food.\"\n \"I\u0027m surprised they\u0027re open this late.\"\n \"Saturday night? They\u0027ll be serving until midnight, probably later.\" He leaned back in his chair. \"Now the way to cap off the meal, if you were to do it right. You ever had something called arak?\"\n \"Is that anything like ouzo?\"\n \"Sort of like ouzo. There\u0027s a difference, but yeah, it\u0027s sort of like it. You like ouzo?\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t say I liked it. There used to be a bar on the corner of Fifty-seventh and Ninth called Antares and Spiro\u0027s, a Greek joint-\"\n \"No kidding, with that name.\"\n \"- and sometimes I\u0027d drop in after a long night drinking bourbon at Jimmy Armstrong\u0027s and have a glass or two of ouzo for a nightcap.\"\n \"Ouzo on top of bourbon, huh?\"\n \"As a digestive,\" I said. \"To settle the stomach.\"\n \"Settle it once and for all, from the sound of it.\" He caught the waiter\u0027s eye, signaled for more coffee. \"I really wanted to drink the other day,\" he said.\n \"But you didn\u0027t.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"That\u0027s the important thing, Pete. Wanting to is normal. This isn\u0027t the first time you wanted to drink since you got sober, is it?\"\n \"No,\" he said. The waiter came and filled our cups. When he\u0027d walked away Pete said, \"But it\u0027s the first time I considered it.\"\n \"Seriously considered it?\"\n \"Yeah, I would say seriously. I would say so.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t do it.\"\n \"No,\" he said. He was looking down into his coffee cup. \"What I almost did, I almost copped.\"\n \"Drugs?\"\n He nodded. \"Smack,\" he said. \"You ever have any experience with heroin?\"\n \"None.\"\n \"Never even tried it?\"\n \"Never even considered the possibility. Never even knew anybody who used it, not in the days when I was drinking. Except for the kind of people I had occasion to arrest.\"\n \"Smack was strictly for lowlife types, then.\"\n \"That\u0027s how I always saw it.\"\n He smiled gently. \"You probably knew some people who used it. They just didn\u0027t let you know it.\"\n \"That\u0027s possible.\"\n \"I always liked it,\" he said. \"I never shot it, I only snorted. I was afraid of needles, which was lucky, because otherwise I\u0027d probably be dead of AIDS by now. You know, you don\u0027t have to shoot to develop a jones.\"\n \"So I understand.\"\n \"I got dopesick a couple of times and it scared me. I kicked it with the help of booze, and then, well, you know the rest of the story. I kicked junk on my own, but I had to go to a rehab to stop drinking. So it was alcohol that really kicked my ass, but in my heart I\u0027m a junkie as much as I\u0027m a drunk.\"\n He took a sip of coffee. \"And the thing is,\" he said, \"it\u0027s a different city out there when you can see it through a junkie\u0027s eyes. I mean, you were a cop and all, and you\u0027ve got street smarts, but if the two of us walk down the street together I\u0027m going to see more dealers than you are. I\u0027m gonna see them and they\u0027re gonna see me and we\u0027re gonna recognize each other. I go anywhere in this city and it wouldn\u0027t take me more than five minutes to find somebody happy to sell me a bag of dope.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-15.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: \n A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
