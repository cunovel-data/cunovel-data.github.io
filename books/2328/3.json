His brother answered on the third ring.\\n\\n He said, \"Petey, I need you out here. Jump in a cab, I\u0027ll pay for it, but get out here right away, you hear me?\"\\n\\n A pause. Then, \"Babe, I\u0027d do anything for you, you know that-\"\\n\\n \"So jump in a cab, man!\"\\n\\n \"- but I can\u0027t be in anything has to do with your business. I just can\u0027t, babe.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not business.\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Francine.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, what\u0027s the matter? Never mind, you\u0027ll tell me when I get out there. You\u0027re at home, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m at home.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get a cab. I\u0027ll be right out.\"\\n\\n WHILE Peter Khoury was looking for a cabdriver willing to take him to his brother\u0027s house in Brooklyn, I was watching a group of reporters on ESPN discussing the likelihood of a cap on players\u0027 salaries. It didn\u0027t break my heart when the phone rang. It was Mick Ballou, calling from the town of Castlebar in County Mayo. The line was clear as a bell; he might have been calling from the back room at Grogan\u0027s.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s grand here,\" he said. \"If you think the Irish are crazy in New York you should meet them on their own home ground. Every other storefront\u0027s a pub, and no one\u0027s out the door before closing hour.\"\\n\\n \"They close early, don\u0027t they?\"\\n\\n \"Too bloody early by half. In your hotel, though, they have to serve drink at any hour to any registered guest that wants it. Now that\u0027s the mark of a civilized country, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely.\"\\n\\n \"They all smoke, though. They\u0027re forever lighting cigarettes and offering the pack around. The French are even worse that way. When I was over there visiting my father\u0027s people they were peeved with me for not smoking. I believe Americans are the only people in the world who\u0027ve had the sense to give it up.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll still find a few smokers in this country, Mick.\"\\n\\n \"Good luck to them, then, suffering through plane rides and films and all the rules against it in public places.\" He told a long story about a man and a woman he\u0027d met a few nights before. It was funny and we both laughed, and then he asked about me and I said I was all right. \"Are you, then,\" he said.\\n\\n \"A little restless, maybe. I\u0027ve had time on my hands lately. And the moon\u0027s full.\"\\n\\n \"Is it,\" he said. \"Here, too.\"\\n\\n \"What a coincidence.\"\\n\\n \"But then it\u0027s always full over Ireland. Good job it\u0027s always raining so you don\u0027t have to look at it all the time. Matt, I\u0027ve an idea. Get on a plane and come over here.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bet you\u0027ve never been to Ireland.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never been out of the country,\" I said. \"Wait a minute, that\u0027s not true, I\u0027ve been to Canada a couple of times and Mexico once, but-\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve never been to Europe?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Well, for Jesus\u0027 sake, get on a plane and come over. Bring herself if you want\"- meaning Elaine- \"or come alone, it makes no matter. I talked to Rosenstein and he says I\u0027d best stay out of the country awhile yet. He says he can get it all straightened out but they\u0027ve got this fucking federal task force and he doesn\u0027t want me on American soil until the all clear\u0027s sounded. I could be stuck in this fucking pesthole another month or more. What\u0027s so funny?\"\\n\\n \"I thought you loved the place, and now it\u0027s a pesthole.\"\\n\\n \"Anywhere\u0027s a pesthole when you haven\u0027t your friends about you. Come on over, man. What do you say?\"\\n\\n PETER Khoury got to his brother\u0027s house just after Kenan had had still another conversation with the gentler of the kidnappers. The man had seemed rather less gentle this time, especially toward the end of the conversation when Khoury tried to demand some evidence that Francine was alive and well. The conversation went something like this:\\n\\n KHOURY: I want to talk to my wife.\\n\\n KIDNAPPER: That\u0027s impossible. She\u0027s at a safe house. I\u0027m at a pay phone.\\n\\n KHOURY: How do I know she\u0027s all right?\\n\\n KIDNAPPER: Because we\u0027ve had every reason to take good care of her. Look how much she\u0027s worth to us.\\n\\n KHOURY: Jesus, how do I even know you\u0027ve got her in the first place?\\n\\n KIDNAPPER: Are you familiar with her breasts?\\n\\n KHOURY: Huh?\\n\\n KIDNAPPER: Would you recognize one of them? That would be the simplest way. I\u0027ll cut off one of her tits and leave it on your doorstep, and that will put your mind at rest.\\n\\n KHOURY: Jesus, don\u0027t say that. Don\u0027t even say that.\\n\\n KIDNAPPER: Then let\u0027s not talk about proof, shall we? We have to trust each other, Mr. Khoury. Believe me, trust is everything in this business.\\n\\n That was the whole thing, Kenan told Peter. He had to trust them, and how could he do that? He didn\u0027t even know who they were.\\n\\n \"I tried to think who I could call,\" he said. \"You know, people in the business. Someone to stand by me, back me up. Anybody I can think of, for all I know, they\u0027re in on it. How can I rule anybody out? Somebody set this up.\"\\n\\n \"How did they-\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know anything, all I know is she went shopping and she never came back. She went out, took the car, and five hours later the phone rings.\"\\n\\n \"Five hours?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, something like that. Petey, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing here, I got no experience in this shit.\"\\n\\n \"You do deals all the time, babe.\"\\n\\n \"A dope deal\u0027s completely different. You structure that so everybody\u0027s safe, everybody\u0027s covered. This case-\"\\n\\n \"People get killed in dope deals all the time.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but there\u0027s generally a reason. Number one, dealing with people you don\u0027t know. That\u0027s the killer. It looks good and it turns into a rip-off. Number two, or maybe its number one and a half, dealing with people you think you know but you don\u0027t really. And the other thing, whatever number you want to give it, people get in trouble because they try to chisel. They try to do the deal without the money, figure they\u0027ll make it good afterward. They get in over their heads, they get away with it, and then one time they don\u0027t. You know where that comes from nine times out of ten, it\u0027s people who get into their own product and their judgment goes down the toilet.\"\\n\\n \"Or they do everything right and then six Jamaicans kick the door in and shoot everybody.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that happens,\" Kenan said. \"It doesn\u0027t have to be Jamokes. What was I reading the other day, Laotians in San Francisco. Every week there\u0027s some new ethnic group looking to kill you.\" He shook his head. \"The thing is, in a righteous dope deal you can walk away from anything that doesn\u0027t look right. You never have to do the deal. If you\u0027ve got the money, you can spend it somewhere else. If you\u0027ve got the product, you can sell it to somebody else. You\u0027re only in the deal for as long as it works, and you can back yourself up, build in safeguards along the way, and from the jump you know the people and whether or not you can trust them.\"\\n\\n \"Whereas here-\"\\n\\n \"Whereas here we got nothing. We got our thumb up our ass, that\u0027s what we got. I said we\u0027ll bring the money and you bring my wife, they said no. They said that\u0027s not the way it works. What am I gonna say, keep my wife? Sell her to somebody else, you don\u0027t like the way I do business? I can\u0027t do that.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Except I could. He said a million, I said four hundred thousand. I said fuck you, that\u0027s all there is, and he bought it. Suppose I said-\"\\n\\n The phone rang. Kenan talked a few minutes, making notes on a scratch pad. \"I\u0027m not coming alone,\" he said at one point. \"I got my brother here, he\u0027s coming with me. No arguments.\" He listened some more and was about to say something else when the phone clicked in his ear.\\n\\n \"We gotta roll,\" he said. \"They want the money in two Hefty bags. That\u0027s easy enough. Why two, I wonder? Maybe they don\u0027t know what four hundred large is, how much space it takes up.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe the doctor told them no heavy lifting.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe. We\u0027re supposed to go to the corner of Ocean Avenue and Farragut Road.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s in Flatbush, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"Sure, Farragut Road, that\u0027s a couple of blocks from Brooklyn College. What\u0027s there?\"\\n\\n \"A phone booth.\" When they had the money divided up and packed in a pair of garbage bags, Kenan handed Peter a gun, a 9-mm automatic. \"Take it,\" he insisted. \"We don\u0027t want to walk into this unarmed.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t want to walk into it at all. What good\u0027s a gun gonna do me?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Take it anyway.\"\\n\\n On the way out the door Peter grabbed his brother\u0027s arm. \"You forgot to set the alarm,\" he said.\\n\\n \"So? They got Francey and we\u0027re carrying the money. What\u0027s left to steal?\"\\n\\n \"You got the alarm, you might as well set it. It can\u0027t be any less useful than the goddamn guns.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, you\u0027re right,\" he said, and ducked into the house. When he emerged he said, \"State-of-the-art security system. You can\u0027t break into my house, can\u0027t tap my phones, can\u0027t bug the premises. All you can do is snatch my wife and make me run around the city with trash bags full of hundred-dollar bills.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the best way, babe? I was thinking Bay Ridge Parkway and then Kings Highway to Ocean.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I guess. There\u0027s a dozen ways you could go, but that\u0027s as good as any. You want to drive, Petey?\"\\n\\n \"You want me to?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, why don\u0027t you? I\u0027d probably rear-end a cop car, the way I am now. Or run over a nun.\"\\n\\n THEY were supposed to be at the Farragut Road pay phone at eight-thirty. They got there three minutes early, according to Peter\u0027s watch. He stayed in the car while Kenan went over to the phone and stood there waiting for it to ring. Earlier, Peter had wedged the gun under his belt in the small of his back. He\u0027d been conscious of the pressure of it while he was driving, and now he took it out and held it in his lap.\\n\\n The phone rang and Kenan answered it. Eight-thirty, Peter\u0027s watch said. Were they doing this by the clock or were they eyeballing the whole operation, somebody sitting in a window in one of the buildings across the street, watching it all happen?\\n\\n Kenan trotted back to the car, leaned against it. \" Veterans Avenue,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Never heard of it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s somewhere between Flatlands and Mill Basin, that area. He gave me directions, Farragut to Flatbush and Flatbush to Avenue N and that runs you right into Veterans Avenue.\"\\n\\n \"And then what happens?\"\\n\\n \"Another pay phone at the corner of Veterans and East Sixty-sixth Street.\"\\n\\n \"Why the running around, do you have any idea?\"\\n\\n \"Make us crazy. Make sure we don\u0027t have a backup. I don\u0027t know, Petey. Maybe they\u0027re just trying to break our balls.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s working.\" Kenan went around to the passenger side, got in. Peter said, \"Farragut to Flatbush, Flatbush to N. That\u0027d be a right on Flatbush and then I guess a left turn on N?\"\\n\\n \"Right. I mean yes, right on Flatbush and left on N.\"\\n\\n \"How much time have we got?\"\\n\\n \"They didn\u0027t say. I don\u0027t think they said a time. They said to hurry.\"\\n\\n \"I guess we won\u0027t stop for coffee.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Kenan said. \"I guess not.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-3.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \\n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
