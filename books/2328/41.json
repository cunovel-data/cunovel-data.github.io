{"id":63766,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"We had cleared off the table. All of the money, repackaged to hide the counterfeit bills, was packed into two suitcases. I spread the map on the table and traced a route to the cemetery, indicating the two entrances on the graveyard\u0027s western border. I explained how it would work, where we\u0027d set up, how the exchange would be made. \"Puts you right out in front,\" Kenan observed. \"I\u0027ll be all right.\" \"If he tries anything-\" \"I don\u0027t think he will.\" You can always kill me, I\u0027d told him. Yes I could, he\u0027d said. \"I am the one who should carry the bags,\" Yuri said. \"They\u0027re not that heavy,\" I said. \"I can manage them.\" \"You make a joke, but I am serious. It is my daughter. I should be out in front.\" I shook my head. If he ever got that close to Callander, I couldn\u0027t trust him not to lose it and go for him. But I had a better reason to offer him. \"I want Lucia to run to safety. If you\u0027re there she\u0027ll want to stay with you. I need you here,\" I said, pointing to the map, \"so you can call to her.\" \"You\u0027ll tuck a gun in your belt,\" Kenan said. \"I probably will, but I don\u0027t know what good it\u0027ll do. If he tries anything I won\u0027t have time to get it out. If he doesn\u0027t I won\u0027t have any use for it. What I wish I had is a Kevlar vest.\" \"That\u0027s the bulletproof mesh? I heard it won\u0027t stop a knife.\" \"Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It won\u0027t always stop a bullet, either, but it gives you a sporting chance.\" \"You know where you can get one?\" \"Not at this hour. Forget it, it\u0027s not important.\" \"No? It sounds pretty important to me.\" \"I don\u0027t even know that they\u0027ve got guns.\" \"Are you kidding? I didn\u0027t think there was anybody in this town doesn\u0027t have a gun. What about the third man, the sharpshooter, guy hiding behind a tombstone covering everybody? What do you figure he\u0027s doing the job with, a fucking Wham-O slingshot?\" \"That\u0027s if there is a third man. I was the one who mentioned him, and Callander was bright enough to follow my lead.\" \"You think they\u0027re doing this with two guys?\" \"They only had two when they kidnapped the girl on Park Avenue. I can\u0027t see going out and recruiting an extra person for an operation like this. This is lust murder that developed a commercial hook to it, not an ordinary professional criminal operation where you can go out and put a string of men together. There are some witnesses who would seem to indicate the existence of a third man in the two abductions that were witnessed, but they may just have assumed there was a driver, because that\u0027s the way you would expect people to do it. But if you only had two people to start with, one of them would double as the driver. And that\u0027s what I think happened.\" \"So we can forget the third man.\" \"No,\" I said. \"That\u0027s the aggravating thing about it. We have to assume he\u0027s there.\" I went into the kitchen for more coffee. When I came back Yuri asked how many men I wanted. He said, \"We have you, me, Kenan, Peter, Dani, and Pavel. Pavel is downstairs, you met him coming into the building. I got three more men ready to come, all I got to do is tell them.\" \"I can think of a dozen,\" Kenan said. \"People I talked to, whether they had money to kick in or not, everybody said the same thing. \u0027You can use a hand, tell me, be right there.\u0027 \" He leaned over the map. \"We can let them get in position, then bring in a dozen more men in three or four cars. Seal up both exits, plus the rest of them, here and here. You\u0027re shaking your head. Why not?\" \"I want to let them get away with the money.\" \"You don\u0027t even want to try for it? After we\u0027ve got the girl back?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because it\u0027s crazy to get into a firefight in a graveyard at night, or shoot at each other from cars careening around Park Slope. An operation like that\u0027s no good unless you can control it, and there are too many ways this one can slip out of control. Look, I sold this by setting it up as a standoff, and I did a good job designing it that way. It is a standoff. We get the girl, they get the money, and everybody goes home alive. A few minutes ago that was all we wanted out of the deal. Is that still how we feel?\" Yuri said it was. Kenan said, \"Yeah, sure, it\u0027s all I ever wanted. I just hate to see them get away with anything.\" \"They won\u0027t. Callander thinks he\u0027s got a week to pack his valise and get out of town. He hasn\u0027t got a week. It won\u0027t take me that long to find him. Meanwhile, how many men do we need? I think we\u0027re fine with the people we\u0027ve already got. Say three cars. Dani and Yuri in one, Peter andâ€¦ is it Pavel in the lobby downstairs? Peter and Pavel in the Toyota, and I\u0027ll ride with Kenan in the Buick. That\u0027s all we need. Six men.\" The phone rang in Lucia\u0027s room. I answered it and spoke to TJ, who was back at the laundromat after having no luck looking in driveways and at curbs for the Honda. I went back to the living room. \"Make that seven,\" I said. Chapter 21 In the car Kenan said, \"I figure the Shore Parkway and the Gowanus. That sound okay to you?\" I told him he knew more about it than I did. He said, \"This kid we\u0027re picking up. How\u0027s he fit into the picture?\" \"He\u0027s a kid from the ghetto who hangs out in Times Square. God knows where he lives. He goes by his initials, assuming they\u0027re his initials and he didn\u0027t find them in a bowl of alphabet soup. He\u0027s been a big help, believe it or not. He put me on to the computer wizards, and he saw Callander tonight and got the license number.\" \"You think he\u0027s gonna do anything for us at the cemetery?\" \"I hope he doesn\u0027t try,\" I said. \"We\u0027re picking him up because I don\u0027t want him wandering around Sunset Park being resourceful when Callander and his friends are on their way home. I\u0027d like to keep him out of harm\u0027s way.\" \"You say he\u0027s a kid?\" I nodded. \"Fifteen, sixteen.\" \"What\u0027s he want to be when he grows up? A detective like you?\" \"That\u0027s what he wants to be now. He doesn\u0027t want to wait until he grows up. I can\u0027t say I blame him. So many of them don\u0027t.\" \"Don\u0027t what?\" \"Grow up. A black teenager living on the streets? They\u0027ve got the average life expectancy of a fruit fly. TJ\u0027s a good kid. I hope he makes it.\" \"And you really don\u0027t know his last name.\" \"No.\" \"You know what\u0027s funny? Between AA and the streets, you know a hell of a lot of people without last names.\" A little later he said, \"You get any sense of Dani? He a relative of Yuri\u0027s or what?\" \"No idea. Why?\" \"I was just thinking, the two of them riding around in that Lincoln with a million dollars in the backseat. We know Dani\u0027s got a gun. Say he pops Yuri and takes off. We wouldn\u0027t even know who to look for, just a Russian guy with a jacket that don\u0027t fit him too good. He\u0027s another guy with no last name. Must be a friend of yours, huh?\" \"I think Yuri trusts him.\" \"He\u0027s probably family. Who else you gonna trust like that?\" \"Anyway, it\u0027s not a million.\" \"Eight hundred thousand. You gonna make me a liar for a lousy two hundred thousand?\" \"And almost a third of it\u0027s counterfeit.\" \"You\u0027re right, it\u0027s hardly worth stealing. We\u0027re lucky if these two jokers we\u0027re meeting are willing to haul it away. If not it goes in the basement, save it for the next Boy Scout paper drive. You want to do me a favor? When you\u0027re up there with a suitcase in each hand, you want to ask our friends a question?\" \"What?\" \"Ask \u0027em how the hell they picked me, will you? Because it\u0027s still driving me nuts.\" \"Oh,\" I said. \"I think I know.\" \"Seriously?\" \"Uh-huh. My first thought was that he was in the dope business on some level or other.\" \"Makes sense, but-\" \"But he\u0027s not, I\u0027m almost certain, because I had somebody run a check and he hasn\u0027t got a criminal record.\" \"Neither have I.\" \"You\u0027re an exception.\" \"That\u0027s true. How about Yuri?\" \"Several arrests in the Soviet Union, no serious jail time. One bust here for receiving stolen goods but the charges were dropped.\" \"But nothing involving narcotics.\" \"No.\" \"All right, Callander\u0027s got a clean slate. So he\u0027s not in the dope business, so-\" \"The DEA was trying to make a case against you a while ago.\" \"Yeah, but it didn\u0027t get anywheres.\" \"I was talking to Yuri before. He said he backed out of a deal last year because he sensed that some agency was trying to trap him with a sting. He had the sense it was federal.\" He turned to look at me, then forced his eyes front and swung out to pass a car. \"Jesus Christ,\" he said. \"This a new national law-enforcement policy? They can\u0027t make a case against us so they kill our wives and daughters?\" \"I think Callander worked for the DEA,\" I said. \"Probably not for very long, and almost certainly not as an accredited agent. Maybe they used him once or twice as a confidential informant, maybe he was strictly office help. He wouldn\u0027t have gone very far and he wouldn\u0027t have lasted very long.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because he\u0027s crazy. He probably got into it because of a low-grade obsession about dope dealers. That\u0027s an asset in that line of work but not when it\u0027s out of proportion. Look, I\u0027m just going on a hunch. There was something he said on the phone when I told him I was Yuri\u0027s partner. It was as if he was starting to say that explained why they hadn\u0027t been able to rope Yuri in.\" \"Jesus.\" \"It\u0027s something I can find out tomorrow or the next day, if I can get a hook into the DEA and see if his name rings a bell with them. Or take an unauthorized dip into their files, if my computer geniuses can swing it.\" Kenan looked thoughtful. \"He didn\u0027t sound like a cop.\" \"No, he didn\u0027t.\" \"But the guy you described wouldn\u0027t really be a cop, would he?\" \"More like a buff. But a buff with the Feds, and fixated on the subject of narcotics.\" \"He knew the wholesale price of a kilo of cocaine,\" Kenan said, \"but I don\u0027t know what that proves. Your friend TJ probably knows the wholesale price of a key.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t be surprised.\" \"Lucia\u0027s classmates at this girls\u0027 school, they probably know it, too. Kind of world we live in.\" \"You should have been a doctor.\" \"Like my old man wanted. No, I don\u0027t think so. But maybe I should have been a counterfeiter. You meet a nicer class of people. At least I wouldn\u0027t have the fucking DEA on my back.\" \"Counterfeiting? You\u0027d have the Secret Service.\" \"Jesus,\" he said. \"If it\u0027s not one goddamn thing it\u0027s another.\" \"THAT the laundromat? There on the right?\" I said it was, and Kenan pulled up in front but kept the motor running. He said, \"How are we on time?\" then glanced at his watch and the dashboard clock and answered his own question. \"We\u0027re fine. Running a little early.\" I was watching the laundromat, but TJ emerged instead from a doorway on the other side of the avenue and crossed over, getting in the back. I introduced them, and each claimed to be pleased to meet the other. TJ shrank back against the seat and Kenan put the car in gear.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-41.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
