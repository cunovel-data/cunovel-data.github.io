{"id":63698,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"It struck me I was hearing a lot about cabs from somebody who was working as a messenger and delivery boy, and then his brother\u0027s name rang a bell. I said, \"You have more than one brother, Pete?\" \"Just the one.\" \"I think you mentioned him in your qualification, something about his occupation.\" A pause. Then, \"Matt, I\u0027m just asking you to come out and listen.\" \"Where are you?\" \"Do you know Brooklyn?\" \"I\u0027d have to be dead.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"Nothing, I was just thinking out loud. A famous short story, \u0027Only the Dead Know Brooklyn.\u0027 I used to know parts of the borough reasonably well. Where are you in Brooklyn?\" \"Bay Ridge. Colonial Road.\" \"That\u0027s easy.\" He gave me the address and I wrote it down. THE R train, also known as the Broadway local of the BMT, runs all the way from 179th Street in Jamaica to within a few blocks of the Verrazano Bridge at the southwest corner of Brooklyn. I caught it at Fifty-seventh and Seventh and got off two stops from the end of the line. There are those who hold that once you leave Manhattan you\u0027re out of the city. They\u0027re wrong, you\u0027re just in another part of the city, but there\u0027s no question that the difference is palpable. You could spot it with your eyes closed. The energy level is different, the air doesn\u0027t hum with the same urgent intensity. I walked a block on Fourth Avenue, past a Chinese restaurant and a Korean greengrocer and an OTB parlor and a couple of Irish bars, then cut over to Colonial Road and found Kenan Khoury\u0027s house. It was one of a group of detached single-family homes, solid square structures that looked to have been built sometime between the wars. A tiny lawn, a half-flight of wooden steps leading to the front entrance. I climbed them and rang the bell. Pete let me in and led me into the kitchen. He introduced me to his brother, who stood to shake hands, then motioned for me to take a chair. He stayed on his feet, walked over to the stove, then turned to look at me.\"Appreciate your coming,\" he said. \"You mind a couple of questions, Mr. Scudder? Before we get started?\" \"Not at all.\" \"Something to drink first? Not a drink drink, I know you know Petey from AA, but there\u0027s coffee made or I can offer you a soft drink. The coffee\u0027s Lebanese style, which is the same general idea as Turkish coffee or Armenian coffee, very thick and strong. Or there\u0027s a jar of instant Yuban if you\u0027d rather have that.\" \"The Lebanese coffee sounds good.\" It tasted good, too. I took a sip and he said, \"You\u0027re a detective, is that right?\" \"Unlicensed.\" \"What\u0027s that mean?\" \"That I have no official standing. I do per diem work for one of the big agencies occasionally, and on those occasions I\u0027m operating on their license, but otherwise what I do is private and unofficial.\" \"And you used to be a cop.\" \"That\u0027s right. Some years ago.\" \"Uh-huh. Uniform or plainclothes or what?\" \"I was a detective.\" \"Had a gold shield, huh?\" \"That\u0027s right. I was attached to the Sixth Precinct in the Village for several years, and before I was stationed for a little while in Brooklyn. That was the Seventy-eighth Precinct, that\u0027s Park Slope and just north of it, the area they\u0027re calling Boerum Hill.\" \"Yeah, I know where it is. I grew up in the Seventy-eighth Precinct. You know Bergen Street? Between Bond and Nevins?\" \"Sure.\" \"That\u0027s where we grew up, me and Petey. You\u0027ll find a lot of people from the Middle East in that neighborhood, within a few blocks of Court and Atlantic. Lebanese, Syrians, Yemenites, Palestinians. My wife was Palestinian, her folks lived on President Street just off Henry. That\u0027s South Brooklyn, but I guess they\u0027re calling it Carroll Gardens now. That coffee all right?\" \"It\u0027s fine.\" \"You want more, just speak up.\" He started to say something else, then turned to face his brother. \"I don\u0027t know, man,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t think this is going to work out.\" \"Tell him the situation, babe.\" \"I just don\u0027t know.\" He turned to me, spun a chair around, sat down straddling it. \"Here\u0027s the deal, Matt. Okay to call you that?\" I said it was. \"Here\u0027s the deal. What I need to know is whether I can tell you something without worrying who you\u0027re gonna tell it to. I guess what I\u0027m asking is to what extent you\u0027re still a cop.\" It was a good question, and I\u0027d often pondered it myself. I said, \"I was a policeman for a lot of years. I\u0027ve been a little less of one every year since I left the job. What you\u0027re asking is if what you tell me will stay confidential. Legally, I don\u0027t have the status of attorney. What you tell me isn\u0027t privileged information. At the same time, I\u0027m not an officer of the court, either, so I\u0027m no more obliged than any other private citizen to report matters that come to my attention.\" \"What\u0027s the bottom line?\" \"I don\u0027t know what the bottom line is. It seems to move around a lot. I can\u0027t offer you a lot in the way of reassurance, because I don\u0027t know what it is you\u0027re thinking about telling me. I came all the way out here because Pete didn\u0027t want to say anything over the phone, and now you don\u0027t seem to want to say anything here, either. Maybe I should go home.\" \"Maybe you should,\" he said. \"Babe-\" \"No,\" he said, getting to his feet. \"It was a good idea, man, but it\u0027s not working out. We\u0027ll find \u0027em ourselves.\" He took a roll of bills from his pocket and peeled off a hundred, extending it across the table to me. \"For your cabs out and back and for your time, Mr. Scudder. I\u0027m sorry we dragged you all the way out here for nothing.\" When I didn\u0027t take the bill he said, \"Maybe your time\u0027s worth more than I figured. Here, and no hard feelings, huh?\" He added a second bill to the first and I still didn\u0027t reach for it. I pushed back my chair and stood up. \"You don\u0027t owe me anything,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know what my time\u0027s worth. Let\u0027s call it an even-up trade for the coffee.\" \"Take the money. For Christ\u0027s sake, the cab had to be twenty-five each way.\" \"I took the subway.\" He stared at me. \"You came out here on the subway? Didn\u0027t my brother tell you to take a cab? What do you want to save nickels and dimes for, especially when I\u0027m paying for it?\" \"Put your money away,\" I said. \"I took the subway because it\u0027s simpler and faster. How I get from one place to another is my business, Mr. Khoury, and I run my business the way I want. You don\u0027t tell me how to get around town and I won\u0027t tell you how to sell crack to schoolchildren, how does that strike you?\" \"Jesus,\" he said. To Pete I said, \"I\u0027m sorry we wasted each other\u0027s time. Thanks for thinking of me.\" He asked me if I wanted to ride back to the city, or at least a lift to the subway stop. \"No,\" I said, \"I think I\u0027d like to walk around Bay Ridge a little. I haven\u0027t been out here in years. I had a case that brought me to within a few blocks of here, right on Colonial Road but a little ways to the north. Right across from the park. Owl\u0027s Head Park, I think it is.\" \"That\u0027s eight, ten blocks from here,\" Kenan Khoury said. \"That sounds right. The guy who hired me was charged with killing his wife, and the work I did for him helped get the charges dropped.\" \"And he was innocent?\" \"No, he killed her,\" I said, remembering the whole thing. \"I didn\u0027t know that. I found out after.\" \"When there was nothing you could do.\" \"Sure there was,\" I said. \"Tommy Tillary, that was his name. I forget his wife\u0027s name, but his girlfriend was Carolyn Cheatham. When she died, he wound up going away for it.\" \"He killed her, too?\" \"No, she killed herself. I fixed it so it looked like murder, and I fixed it so he would go away for it. I got him out of one scrape that he didn\u0027t deserve to get out of, so it seemed fitting to get him into another one.\" \"How much time did he do?\" \"As much as he could. He died in prison. Somebody stuck a knife in him.\" I sighed. \"I thought I\u0027d go walk past his house, see if it brought back any memories, but they seem to have come back all by themselves.\" \"It bother you?\" \"Remembering, you mean? Not particularly. I can think of a lot of things I\u0027ve done that bother me more.\" I looked around for my coat, then remembered I hadn\u0027t worn one. It was spring outside, sport jacket weather, although it would be going down into the forties in the evening. I started for the door and he said, \"Hold it a minute, will you, Mr. Scudder?\" I looked at him. \"I was out of line,\" he said. \"I apologize.\" \"You don\u0027t have to apologize.\" \"Yes I do. I flew off the handle. This is nothing. Earlier today I broke a phone, I got a busy signal and I flew into a rage and smashed the receiver against the wall until the housing splintered.\" He shook his head. \"I never get like that. I\u0027ve been under a strain.\" \"There\u0027s a lot of that going around.\" \"Yeah, I suppose there is. The other day some guys kidnapped my wife, cut her up in little pieces wrapped in plastic and sent her back to me in the trunk of a car. Maybe that\u0027s the same strain everybody else is under. I wouldn\u0027t know.\" Pete said, \"Easy, babe-\" \"No, I\u0027m all right,\" Kenan said. \"Matt, sit down a minute. Let me just run the whole thing down for you, top to bottom, and then you decide if you want to walk or not. Forget what I said before. I\u0027m not worried, who you\u0027re gonna tell or not tell. I just don\u0027t want to say it out loud \u0027cause it makes it all real, but it\u0027s real already, isn\u0027t it?\" HE took me through it, giving me the story essentially as I recounted it earlier. There were some details I supplied that came out later in my own investigation, but the Khoury brothers had already unearthed a certain amount of data on their own. Friday they found the Toyota Camry where she\u0027d parked it on Atlantic Avenue, and that had led them to The Arabian Gourmet, while the bags of groceries in the trunk had let them know about her stop at D\u0027Agostino\u0027s. When he was done telling it I declined the offer of another cup of coffee and accepted a glass of club soda. I said, \"I have some questions.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"What did you do with the body?\" The brothers exchanged glances, and Pete gestured for Kenan to go ahead. He took a breath and said, \"I have this cousin, he\u0027s a veterinarian, has an animal hospital on- well, it doesn\u0027t matter where it is, it\u0027s in the old neighborhood. I called him and told him I needed private access to his place of business.\" \"When was this?\" \"This was Friday afternoon that I called him and Friday night that I got the key from him and we went over there. He has a unit, I guess you would call it an oven, that he uses for cremating people\u0027s pets that he puts to sleep. We took the, uh, we took the-\" \"Easy, babe.\" He shook his head, impatient. \"I\u0027m all right, I just don\u0027t know how to say it. What do you call it? We took the pieces of, of Francine, and we cremated her.\" \"You unwrapped all of the, uh-\" \"No, what for? The tape and plastic burned along with everything else.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-5.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
