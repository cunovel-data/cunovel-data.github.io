Yeah, we unwrapped enough to, uh, to be sure.\"\n \"I have to ask all this.\"\n \"I understand.\"\n \"The point is there\u0027s no corpse left, is that correct?\"\n He nodded. \"Just ashes. Ashes and bone chips, is what it amounts to. You think cremation and you think you\u0027ll wind up with nothing but powdery ash, like what comes out of a furnace, but that\u0027s not how it works. There\u0027s an auxiliary unit he\u0027s got for pulverizing the bone segments so it\u0027s less obvious what you\u0027ve got.\" He raised his eyes to meet mine. \"When I was in high school I worked afternoons at Lou\u0027s place. I wasn\u0027t going to mention his name. Fuck it, what difference does it make? My father wanted me to become a doctor, he thought this would be good training. I don\u0027t know if it was or not, but I was familiar with the place, the equipment.\"\n \"Does your cousin know why you wanted to use his place?\"\n \"People know what they want to know. He couldn\u0027t have figured I wanted to slip in there at night and give myself a rabies shot. We were there all night. The unit he has is pet size, we had to do several loads and let the unit cool down in between. Jesus, it\u0027s killing me to talk about it.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"It\u0027s not your fault. Did Lou know I used the cooker? I figure he had to know. He has to have a pretty good idea what kind of business I\u0027m in. He probably figures I killed a competitor and wanted to get rid of the evidence. People see all this shit on television and they think that\u0027s how the world works.\"\n \"And he didn\u0027t object?\"\n \"He\u0027s family. He knew it was urgent and he knew it wasn\u0027t something we should talk about. And I gave him some money. He didn\u0027t want to take it, but the guy\u0027s got two kids in college so how can he not take it? It wasn\u0027t that much.\"\n \"How much?\"\n \"Two grand. That\u0027s pretty low-budget for a funeral, isn\u0027t it? I mean you can spend more than that on a casket.\" He shook his head. \"I got the ashes in a tin can in the safe downstairs. I don\u0027t know what to do with them. No idea what she would have wanted. We never discussed it. Jesus, she was twenty-four years old. Nine years younger than me, nine years less a month. We were married two years.\"\n \"No children.\"\n \"No. We were gonna wait one more year and then- oh, Jesus, this is terrible. It bother you if I have a drink?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Petey says the same. Fuck it, I\u0027m not having one. I had one pop Thursday afternoon after I talked on the phone with them and I haven\u0027t had anything since. I get the urge and I just push it away. You know why?\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because I want to feel this. You think I did the wrong thing? Taking her to Lou\u0027s place, cremating her. You think that was wrong?\"\n \"I think it was unlawful.\"\n \"Yeah, well, I wasn\u0027t too worried about that aspect of it.\"\n \"I know you weren\u0027t. You were just trying to do what was decent. But in the process you destroyed evidence. Dead bodies hold a great deal of information for someone who knows what to look for. When you reduce a body to ashes and bone chips, all that information is lost.\"\n \"Does it matter?\"\n \"It might be helpful to know how she died.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care how. All I want to know is who.\"\n \"One might lead to the other.\"\n \"So you think I did the wrong thing. Jesus, I couldn\u0027t call the cops, hand them a sack full of cuts of meat, say, \u0027This is my wife, take good care of her.\u0027 I never call the cops, I\u0027m in a business where you don\u0027t, but if I had opened the trunk of the Tempo and she was there in one piece, dead but intact, maybe, maybe, I\u0027d have reported it. But this way-\"\n \"I understand.\"\n \"But you think I did the wrong thing.\"\n \"You did what you had to do,\" Peter said.\n Isn\u0027t that what everybody always does? I said, \"I don\u0027t know a lot about right and wrong. I probably would have done the same thing, if I\u0027d had a cousin with a crematorium in his back room. But what I would have done is beside the point. You did what you did. The question is, where do you go from here?\"\n \"Where?\"\n \"That\u0027s the question.\"\n IT wasn\u0027t the only question. I asked a great many questions, and I asked most of them more than once. I took them both back and forth over their story, and I wrote down a lot of notes in my notebook. It began to look as though the segmented remains of Francine Khoury constituted the only piece of tangible evidence in the entire affair, and they had gone up in smoke.\n When I finally closed my notebook the two Khoury brothers sat waiting for a word from me. \"On the face of it,\" I said, \"they look pretty safe. They made their play and carried it off without giving you a clue who they are. If they left tracks anywhere, they haven\u0027t shown up yet. It\u0027s possible someone at the supermarket or the place on Atlantic Avenue recognized one of them or caught a license number, and it\u0027s worth an intensive investigation to try to turn up such a witness, but he\u0027s no more than hypothetical at this point. The odds are that there won\u0027t be a witness, or that what he saw won\u0027t lead anywhere.\"\n \"You\u0027re saying we got no chance.\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m saying at all. I\u0027m saying an investigation has to do something besides work with the clues they left behind. One starting point lies in the fact that they got away with almost half a million dollars. There\u0027s two things they could do, and either one could spotlight them.\"\n Kenan thought about it. \"Spend it\u0027s one of them,\" he said. \"What\u0027s the other?\"\n \"Talk about it. Crooks talk all the time, especially when they\u0027ve got something to brag about, and sometimes they talk to people who\u0027ll happily sell them out. The trick is to get the word out so those people know who the buyer is.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got an idea how to do that?\"\n \"I\u0027ve got a lot of ideas,\" I admitted. \"Earlier you wanted to know to what extent I was still a cop. I don\u0027t know, but I still approach this kind of problem the way I did when I carried a badge, turning it this way and that until I can get some kind of grip on it. In a case like this one I can immediately see several different lines of investigation to pursue. There\u0027s every chance in the world that none of them will lead anywhere, but they\u0027re still the approaches that ought to be tried.\"\n \"So you want to give it a shot?\"\n I looked down at my notebook. I said, \"Well, I have two problems. The first one I think I mentioned to Pete on the phone. I\u0027m supposed to go to Ireland the end of the week.\"\n \"On business?\"\n \"Pleasure. I just made the arrangements this morning.\"\n \"You could cancel.\"\n \"I could.\"\n \"You lose any money canceling, your fee from me\u0027d make that up to you. What\u0027s the other problem?\"\n \"The other problem\u0027s what use you\u0027ll make of whatever I might turn up.\"\n \"Well, you know the answer to that.\"\n I nodded. \"That\u0027s the problem.\"\n \"Because you can\u0027t make a case against them, prosecute them for kidnapping and homicide. There\u0027s no evidence of any crime committed, there\u0027s just a woman who disappeared.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"So you must know what I want, what the point of all this is. You want me to say it?\"\n \"You might as well.\"\n \"I want those fuckers dead. I want to be there, I want to do it, I want to see them die.\" He said this calmly, levelly, in a voice with no emotion in it. \"That\u0027s what I want,\" he said. \"Right now I want it so bad I don\u0027t want anything else. I can\u0027t imagine ever wanting anything else. That about what you figured?\"\n \"Just about.\"\n \"People who\u0027d do something like this, take an innocent woman and turn her into cutlets, does it bother you what happens to them?\"\n I thought about it, but not for very long. \"No,\" I said.\n \"We\u0027ll do what has to be done, me and my brother. You won\u0027t have a part of that.\"\n \"In other words I\u0027d just be sentencing them to death.\"\n He shook his head. \"They sentenced themselves,\" he said. \"By what they did. You\u0027re just helping play out the hand. What do you say?\"\n I hesitated.\n He said, \"You\u0027ve got another problem, don\u0027t you? My profession.\"\n \"It\u0027s a factor,\" I said.\n \"That line about selling crack to schoolchildren. I don\u0027t, uh, set up shop in the schoolyard.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t figure you did.\"\n \"Properly speaking, I\u0027m not a dealer. I\u0027m what they call a trafficker. You understand the distinction?\"\n \"Sure,\" I said. \"You\u0027re the big fish that manages to stay out of the nets.\"\n He laughed. \"I don\u0027t know that I\u0027m big particularly. In certain respects the middle-level distributors are the biggest, do the most volume. I deal in weight, meaning I either bring product in in quantity or I buy it from the person who brings it in and turn it over to someone who sells smaller amounts. My customer probably does more business than I do because he\u0027s buying and selling all the time, where I may only do two or three deals a year.\"\n \"But you make out all right.\"\n \"I make out. It\u0027s hazardous, you\u0027ve got the law to worry about and you\u0027ve got people looking to rip you off. Where the risks are high the rewards are generally high also. And the business is there. People want the product.\"\n \"By product you mean cocaine.\"\n \"Actually I don\u0027t do much with coke. Most of my business is heroin. Some hash, but mostly heroin the past couple of years. Look, I\u0027ll tell you right out, I\u0027m not gonna apologize for it. People take it, they get hooked, they rob their mother\u0027s purse, they break into houses, they OD and die with needles in their arms, they share needles and get AIDS. I know the whole story. There\u0027s people who make guns, people who distill liquor, people who grow tobacco. How many people a year die of liquor and tobacco compared to the number die from drugs?\"\n \"Alcohol and tobacco are legal.\"\n \"What difference does that make?\"\n \"It makes some kind of difference. I\u0027m not sure how much.\"\n \"Maybe. I don\u0027t see it myself. Either case, the product is dirty. It kills people, or it\u0027s the substance they use to kill themselves or each other. One thing in my favor, I don\u0027t advertise what I sell, I don\u0027t have lobbyists in Congress, I don\u0027t hire PR people to tell the public the shit I sell is good for them. The day people stop wanting drugs is the day I find something else to buy and sell, and I won\u0027t whine about it and look for the government to give me a federal subsidy, either.\"\n Peter said, \"It\u0027s still not lollipops you\u0027re selling, babe.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s not. The product\u0027s dirty. I never said it wasn\u0027t. But what I do I do clean. I don\u0027t screw people, I don\u0027t kill people, I deal fair and I\u0027m careful who I deal with. That\u0027s why I\u0027m alive and that\u0027s why I\u0027m not in jail.\"\n \"Have you ever been?\"\n \"No. I\u0027ve never been arrested. So if that\u0027s a consideration, how it would look, you working for a known dope dealer-\"\n \"That\u0027s not a consideration.\"\n \"Well, from an official standpoint, I\u0027m not a known dealer. I won\u0027t say there\u0027s nobody in the Narcotics Squad or the DEA who knows who I am, but I don\u0027t have a record. I\u0027ve never to my knowledge been the official subject of an investigation. My house isn\u0027t bugged and my phone\u0027s not tapped. I\u0027d know if it was, I told you about that.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-6.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: \n A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
