Your occupation was part of the package. Where did I get off telling you to keep this and change that?\"\n I went to her window and looked across at Queens. Queens is the borough of cemeteries, it overflows with them, while Brooklyn has only Green-Wood.\n I turned to face her and said, \"Besides, I was scared to say anything. Maybe it would lead to an ultimatum, choose one or the other, quit turning tricks or I\u0027m out of here. And suppose you didn\u0027t pick me?\n \"Or suppose you did? Then what does that commit me to? Does it give you the right to tell me what you don\u0027t like about the way I live my life?\n \"If you stop going to bed with clients, does that mean I can\u0027t go to bed with other women? As it happens I haven\u0027t been with anybody else since we started keeping company again, but I\u0027ve always felt I had the right. It hasn\u0027t happened, and once or twice I made a conscious choice to keep it from happening, but I didn\u0027t feel committed to that course. Or if I did it was a secret commitment. I wasn\u0027t about to let either of us know about it.\n \"What happens to our relationship? Does it mean we have to get married? I don\u0027t know that I want to. I was married once and I didn\u0027t much like it. I wasn\u0027t very good at it, either.\n \"Does it mean we have to live together? I don\u0027t know that I want that, either. I haven\u0027t lived with anybody since I left Anita and the boys, and that was a long time ago. There are things I like about living alone. I don\u0027t know that I want to give it up.\n \"But it eats at me, knowing you\u0027re with other guys. I know there\u0027s no love in it, I know there\u0027s precious little sex in it, I know it has more in common with massage than with lovemaking. Knowing this doesn\u0027t seem to matter.\n \"And it gets in the way. I called you this morning and you called back an hour later. And I wondered where you were when I called, but I didn\u0027t ask because you might say you were with a john. Or you might not say it, and I\u0027d wonder what you weren\u0027t saying.\"\n \"I was getting my hair done,\" she said.\n \"Oh. It looks nice.\"\n \"Thanks.\"\n \"It\u0027s different, isn\u0027t it? It does look nice. I didn\u0027t notice, I never notice, but I like it.\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know where I\u0027m going with this,\" I said. \"But I figured I had to tell you how I felt, and what\u0027s been going on with me. I love you. I know that\u0027s a word we don\u0027t speak, and one reason I have trouble with it is I don\u0027t know what the hell it means. But whatever it means, it\u0027s how I feel about you. Our relationship is important to me. In fact its importance is part of the problem, because I\u0027ve been so afraid it would change into something I won\u0027t like that I\u0027ve been withholding myself from you.\" I stopped for breath. \"I guess that\u0027s it. I didn\u0027t know I was going to say that much and I don\u0027t know if it came out right, but I guess that\u0027s it.\"\n She was looking at me. It was hard to meet her gaze.\n \"You\u0027re a very brave man,\" she said.\n \"Oh, please.\"\n \" \u0027Oh, please.\u0027 You weren\u0027t scared? I was scared, and I wasn\u0027t even talking.\"\n \"Yes, I was scared.\"\n \"That\u0027s what brave is, doing what scares you. Walking into those guns at the cemetery must have been a piece of cake in comparison.\"\n \"The funny thing is,\" I said, \"I wasn\u0027t that fearful at the cemetery. One thought that came to me was that I\u0027ve lived long enough so that I don\u0027t have to worry about dying young.\"\n \"That must have been comforting.\"\n \"Well, it was, oddly enough. My biggest fear was that something would happen to the girl and that it would be my fault, for doing something wrong or not taking some useful action. Once she was back with her father I relaxed. I guess I didn\u0027t really believe anything was going to happen to me.\"\n \"Thank God you\u0027re all right.\"\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\n \"Just a few tears.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to-\"\n \"To what, to reach me emotionally? Don\u0027t apologize.\"\n \"All right.\"\n \"So my mascara runs. So what.\" She dabbed at her eyes with a tissue. \"Oh, God,\" she said. \"This is so embarrassing. I feel so stupid.\"\n \"Because of a few tears?\"\n \"No, because of what I have to say next. My turn now, okay?\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"Don\u0027t interrupt, huh? There\u0027s something I haven\u0027t told you, and I feel really stupid about it, and I don\u0027t know where to start. All right, I\u0027ll blurt it out. I quit.\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"I quit. I quit fucking, all right. My God, the look on your face. Other men, silly. I quit.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have to make that decision,\" I said. \"I just wanted to say how I felt, and-\"\n \"You weren\u0027t going to interrupt.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, but-\"\n \"I\u0027m not saying I quit now. I quit three months ago. More than three months ago. Sometime before the first of the year. Maybe it was even before Christmas. No, I think there was one guy after Christmas. I could look it up.\n \"But it doesn\u0027t matter. I could look it up if I ever want to celebrate my anniversary, the way you celebrate the date of your last drink, but maybe not. I don\u0027t know.\"\n It was hard not saying anything. I had things to say, questions to ask, but I let her go on.\n \"I don\u0027t know if I ever told you this,\" she said, \"but a few years ago I realized that prostitution saved my life. I\u0027m serious about that. The childhood I had, my crazy mother, the kind of teenager I turned out to be, I think I probably would have killed myself, or found somebody to do it for me. Instead I started selling my ass, and it made me aware of my worth as a human being. It destroys a lot of girls, it really does, but it saved me. Go figure.\n \"I made a nice life for myself. I saved my money, I invested, I bought this apartment. Everything worked.\n \"But sometime last summer I started to realize that it wasn\u0027t working anymore. Because of what we have. You and I. I told myself that was meshugga, what you and I have is in one compartment and what I do for money is way over there, but it got harder to keep the doors of the compartments shut tight. I felt disloyal, which was strange, and I felt dirty, which was something I never really felt hooking, or if I did I was never aware of it.\n \"So I thought, well, Elaine, you had a longer run than most of them, and you\u0027re a little old for the game anyway. And they\u0027ve got all these new diseases, and you\u0027ve had a scaled-down practice the past few years anyway, and just how many executives do you figure would throw themselves out of windows if you hung it up?\n \"But I was afraid to tell you. For one thing, how did I know I wouldn\u0027t want to change my mind? I figured I ought to keep my options open. And then, after I\u0027d told all my regulars I was retired, after I sold my book and did everything but change my number, I was afraid to tell you because I didn\u0027t know what it would do. Maybe you wouldn\u0027t want me anymore. Maybe I\u0027d stop being interesting, I\u0027d just be this aging broad running around taking college courses. Maybe you\u0027d feel trapped, like I was pressuring you into marriage. Maybe you\u0027d want to get married, or live together, and I haven\u0027t ever been married but then again I haven\u0027t ever wanted to be. And I\u0027ve lived alone ever since I got out of my mother\u0027s house, and I\u0027m good at it and I\u0027m used to it. And if one of us wants to get married and the other doesn\u0027t, then where are we?\n \"So that\u0027s my dirty little secret, if you want to call it that, and I wish to God I could stop crying because I\u0027d like to look presentable, if not glamorous. Do I look like a raccoon?\"\n \"Only the face.\"\n \"Well,\" she said. \"That\u0027s something. You\u0027re just an old bear. Did you know that?\"\n \"So you\u0027ve said.\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s true. You\u0027re my bear and I love you.\"\n \"I love you.\"\n \"The whole thing\u0027s very fucking Gift-of-the-Magi, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s a beautiful story and who can we tell?\"\n \"Nobody diabetic.\"\n \"Send \u0027em right into sugar shock, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid so. Where do you go when you slip away for mysterious appointments? I assumed, you know-\"\n \"That I was going to blow some guy in a hotel room. Well, sometimes I was getting my hair done.\"\n \"Like this morning.\"\n \"Right. And sometimes I was going to my shrink appointment, and-\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know you were seeing a shrink.\"\n \"Uh-huh, twice a week since mid-February. A lot of my identity is bound up in what I\u0027ve been doing all these years, and all of a sudden I\u0027ve got a lot of crap to deal with. I guess it helps to talk to her.\" She shrugged. \"And I\u0027ve gone to a couple of Al-Anon meetings, too.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know that.\"\n \"Well, how would you know? I didn\u0027t tell you. I figured they could give me tips on how to deal with you. Instead their program is all about dealing with myself. I call that sneaky.\"\n \"Yeah, they\u0027re devious bastards.\"\n \"Anyway,\" she said, \"I feel stupid for keeping it all to myself, but I was a whore for a lot of years, and candor\u0027s not part of the job description.\"\n \"As opposed to police work.\"\n \"Right. You poor bear, up all night, running around Brooklyn with crazy people. And it\u0027s going to be hours before you get a chance to sleep.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"Uh-huh. You\u0027re my only sexual outlet now, do you realize what that means? I\u0027m likely to prove insatiable.\"\n \"Let\u0027s see,\" I said.\n AND, later, she said, \"You really haven\u0027t been with anybody else since we\u0027ve been together?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Well, you probably will. Most men do. I speak as one with professional knowledge of the subject.\"\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"Not today, though.\"\n \"No, not today. But if you do it\u0027s not the end of the world. Just so you come home where you belong.\"\n \"Whatever you say, dear.\"\n \" \u0027Whatever you say, dear.\u0027 You just want to go to sleep. Listen, as far as the other\u0027s concerned, we can get married or not get married, and we can live together or not live together. We could live together without getting married. Could we get married without living together?\"\n \"If we wanted.\"\n \"You think so? You know what it sounds like, it sounds like a Polish joke. But maybe it would work for us. You could keep your squalid hotel room, and several nights a week you\u0027d put on Call Forwarding and spend the night with moi. And we could… you know what?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I think this is all something we\u0027re going to have to take a day at a time.\"\n \"That\u0027s a good phrase,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll have to remember that.\"\n Chapter 24\n A day or so later, an anonymous tip led officers of Brooklyn\u0027s Seventy-second Precinct to the house Albert Wallens had inherited upon his mother\u0027s death three years before. There they found Wallens, a twenty-eight-year-old unemployed construction worker with a record of sexual offenses and minor assault charges. Wallens was dead, with a length of piano wire fastened around his neck. In the same basement room they also found what appeared to be the mutilated corpse of another man, but thirty-six-year-old Raymond Joseph Callander, whose employment history included a seven-month hitch as a civilian employee with the New York office of the Drug Enforcement Administration, was still alive. He was removed to Maimonides Medical Center where he regained consciousness but was unable to communicate, making simple cawing sounds until his death two days later. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-47.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: \n A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
