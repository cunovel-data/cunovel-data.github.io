{"id":63761,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"I CALLED TJ\u0027s beeper and punched in the number on the Landau girl\u0027s Snoopy figural phone. Snoopy and Michael Jackson both seemed to play key roles in her personal mythology, judging from the room\u0027s decor. I paced, waiting for my call, and found a family photo on the white enamel dressing table, Yuri and a dark-haired woman and a girl with dark hair that fell past her shoulders in cascading ringlets. Lucia looked to be about ten in the photo. Another photo showed her alone, older, and looked to have been taken last June at graduation. Her hair was shorter in the more recent photo and her face looked serious and mature for her years.\n The phone rang. I picked it up and he said, \"Yo, who wants TJ?\"\n \"It\u0027s Matt,\" I said.\n \"Hey, my man! What\u0027s goin\u0027, Owen?\"\n \"Serious business,\" I said. \"It\u0027s an emergency, and I need your help.\"\n \"You got it.\"\n \"Can you get hold of the Kongs?\"\n \"You mean right away? They sometimes hard to reach. Jimmy Hong got a beeper, but he don\u0027t always have it with him.\"\n \"See if you can get him and give him this number.\"\n \"Sure. That\u0027s it?\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"Do you remember the laundromat we went to last week?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"Do you know how to get there?\"\n \"R train to Forty-fifth, a block to Fifth Avenue, four, five blocks to the wishee-washee.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t realize you were paying attention.\"\n \"Shit,\" he said. \"Man, I allus payin\u0027 attention. I\u0027s attentive.\"\n \"Not just resourceful?\"\n \"Attentive an\u0027 resourceful.\"\n \"Can you get out there right away?\"\n \"Right now? Or call the Kongs first?\"\n \"Call them, then go. Are you near the subway?\"\n \"Man, I always be near the subway. I talkin\u0027 to you on the phone the Kongs liberated, Forty-third an\u0027 Eighth.\"\n \"Call me as soon as you get out there.\"\n \" \u0027Kay. Somethin\u0027 big goin\u0027 down, huh?\"\n \"Very big,\" I said.\n I LEFT the bedroom door open so that I could hear the phone if it rang and went back into the living room. Peter Khoury was at the window looking out at the ocean. We hadn\u0027t talked much on the drive, but he\u0027d volunteered the information that he hadn\u0027t had a drink or a drug since the meeting I\u0027d seen him at. \"So I got five days,\" he said.\n \"That\u0027s great.\"\n \"That\u0027s the party line, isn\u0027t it? One day or twenty years, you tell somebody your time and they tell you it\u0027s great. \u0027You\u0027re sober today and that\u0027s what counts.\u0027 Fucked if I know what counts anymore.\"\n I went over to Kenan and Yuri and we talked. The bedroom phone didn\u0027t ring, but after perhaps fifteen minutes the one in the living room sounded and Yuri answered it. He said, \"Yeah, this is Landau,\" and glanced significantly at me, then tossed his head to get the hair out of his eyes. \"I want to talk to my daughter,\" he said. \"You got to let me talk to my daughter.\"\n I went over and he handed me the phone. I said, \"I hope the girl\u0027s alive.\"\n There was a silence, then, \"Who the fuck are you?\"\n \"I\u0027m the best chance you\u0027ve got of making a nice clean exchange, the girl for the money. But you\u0027d better not hurt her, and if you\u0027re playing any games they better get called right now on account of rain. Because she has to be alive and well for the deal to happen.\"\n \"Fuck this shit,\" he said. There was a pause and I thought he was going to say more, but he hung up.\n I reported the conversation to Yuri and Kenan. Yuri was agitated, concerned that I was going to screw things up by taking a hard line. Kenan told him I knew what I was doing. I wasn\u0027t sure he was right, but I was glad for the support.\n \"The important thing right now is to keep her alive,\" I said. \"They have to know that they won\u0027t be able to rig the exchange on their terms, without even demonstrating that they\u0027ve got a living hostage for us to ransom.\"\n \"But if you make them mad-\"\n \"They\u0027re already madder than hatters. I know what you\u0027re saying, you don\u0027t want to give them an excuse to kill her, but they don\u0027t need an excuse. It\u0027s already on their agenda. They have to have a reason to keep her alive.\"\n Kenan backed me up. \"I did everything their way,\" he said. \"Everything they wanted. They sent her back-\" He hesitated, and I finished the sentence mentally: \"in pieces.\" But he hadn\u0027t shared that aspect of Francine\u0027s death with Yuri and didn\u0027t do so now. \"- sent her back dead,\" he said.\n \"We\u0027re going to need cash,\" I said. \"What do you have? What can you raise?\"\n \"God, I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Cash I got damn little of. Do the bastards want cocaine? I got fifteen kilos of slab ten minutes from here.\" He looked at Kenan. \"You want to buy it? Tell me what you want to pay me.\"\n Kenan shook his head. \"I\u0027ll lend you what I got in the safe, Yuri. I\u0027m in the bucket already waiting for a hash deal to fall apart. I fronted some money and I think it was a mistake.\"\n \"What kind of hash?\"\n \"Out of Turkey via Cyprus. Opiated hash. What\u0027s the difference, it ain\u0027t gonna happen. I got maybe one hundred large in the safe. Time comes I\u0027ll run back to the house and get it. You\u0027re welcome to it.\"\n \"You know I\u0027m good for it.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\n Landau blinked away tears, and when he tried to speak his voice was choked up. He could barely get the words out. He said, \"Listen to this man. I hardly know him, this fucking Arab here, he\u0027s giving me a hundred thousand dollars.\" He took Kenan in his arms and hugged him, sobbing.\n The phone rang in Lucia\u0027s room. I went to answer it.\n TJ, calling from Brooklyn. \"At the laundromat,\" he said. \"What I do? Wait for some white dude to come in an\u0027 use the phone?\"\n \"That\u0027s right. He should get there sooner or later. If you could park yourself at the restaurant across the street and keep an eye on the laundromat entrance-\"\n \"Do better than that, man. I be right here in the laundromat, just another cat waitin\u0027 on his clothes. Neighborhood here\u0027s enough different colors so\u0027s I don\u0027t stick out too much. Kongs ever call you?\"\n \"No. Did you reach them?\"\n \"Beeped \u0027em and put your number in, but if Jimmy don\u0027t have the beeper with him, it\u0027s like it ain\u0027t beepin\u0027.\"\n \"Like that tree in the forest.\"\n \"Say what?\"\n \"Never mind.\"\n \"I be in touch,\" he said.\n WHEN the next call came in Yuri answered it, said, \"Just a minute,\" and passed it to me. The voice I heard was different this time, softer, more cultured. There was a nastiness in it but less of the obvious anger of the previous speaker.\n \"I understand we have a new player in the game,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t believe we\u0027ve been introduced.\"\n \"I\u0027m a friend of Mr. Landau\u0027s. My name\u0027s not important.\"\n \"One likes to know who\u0027s on the other side.\"\n \"In a sense,\" I said, \"we\u0027re on the same side, aren\u0027t we? We both want the exchange to go through.\"\n \"Then all you have to do is follow instructions.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s not that simple.\"\n \"Of course it is. We tell you what to do and you do it. If you ever want to see the girl again.\"\n \"You have to convince me that she\u0027s alive.\"\n \"You have my word on it.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said.\n \"It\u0027s not good enough?\"\n \"You lost a lot of credibility when you returned Mrs. Khoury in poor condition.\"\n There was a pause. Then, \"How interesting. You don\u0027t sound very Russian, you know. Nor do the tones of Brooklyn echo in your speech. There were special circumstances with Mrs. Khoury. Her husband tried to haggle, in the nature of his race. He sliced the price, and we in turn- well, you can finish that thought yourself, can\u0027t you?\"\n And Pam Cassidy, I thought. What did she do that provoked you? But what I said was, \"We won\u0027t argue the price.\"\n \"You\u0027ll pay the million.\"\n \"For the girl, alive and well.\"\n \"I assure you she\u0027s both.\"\n \"And I still need more than your word. Put her on the phone, let her father talk to her.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid that won\u0027t-\" he began, and the recorded voice of a NYNEX announcer cut in to ask for more money. \"I\u0027ll call you back,\" he said.\n \"Out of quarters? Give me your number, I\u0027ll call you.\"\n He laughed and broke the connection.\n I WAS alone in the apartment with Yuri when the next call came. Kenan and Peter were out with one of the two guards from downstairs, looking to raise what cash they could. Yuri had given them a list of names and phone numbers, and they had some sources of their own. It would have been simpler if we could have made the calls from the penthouse, but we only had the two phone lines and I wanted to keep both of them open.\n \"You\u0027re not in the business,\" Yuri said. \"You\u0027re some kind of cop, yes?\"\n \"Private.\"\n \"Private, so you been working for Kenan. Now you\u0027re working for me, right?\"\n \"I\u0027m just working. I\u0027m not looking to be on the payroll, if that\u0027s what you mean.\"\n He waved the issue aside. \"This is a good business,\" he said, \"but also it\u0027s no good. You know?\"\n \"I think so.\"\n \"I want to be out of it. That\u0027s one reason I got no cash. I make lots of money, but I don\u0027t want it in cash and I don\u0027t want it in goods. I own parking lots, I own a restaurant, I spread it out, you know? In a little while I\u0027m out of the dope business altogether. A lot of Americans start out as gangsters, yes? And wind up legitimate businessmen.\"\n \"Sometimes.\"\n \"Some are gangsters forever. But not all. Wasn\u0027t for Devorah, I\u0027d be out of it already.\"\n \"Your wife?\"\n \"The hospital bills, the doctors, my God, what it cost. No insurance. We were greenhorns, what did we know from Blue Cross? Doesn\u0027t matter. Whatever it cost I paid. I was glad to pay it. I would have paid more to keep her alive, I would have paid anything. I would have sold the fillings out of my teeth if I could have bought her another day. I paid hundreds of thousands of dollars and she had every day the doctors could give her, and what days they were, the poor woman, what she suffered through. But she wanted all the life she could get, you know?\" He wiped a broad hand across his forehead. He was about to say something else but the phone rang. Wordless, he pointed at it.\n I picked it up.\n The same man said, \"Shall we try again? I\u0027m afraid the girl cannot come to the phone. That\u0027s out of the question. How else can we reassure you of her well-being?\"\n I covered the mouthpiece. \"Something your daughter would know.\"\n He shrugged. \"The dog\u0027s name?\"\n Into the phone I said, \"Have her tell you- no, wait a minute.\" I covered the phone and said, \"They could know that. They\u0027ve been shadowing her for a week or more, they know your schedule, they\u0027ve undoubtedly seen her walking the dog, heard her call him by name. Think of something else.\"\n \"We had a dog before this one,\" he said. \"A little black-and-white one, it got hit by a car. She was just a small thing herself when we had that dog.\"\n \"But she would remember it?\"\n \"Who could forget? She loved the dog.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-36.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: \n A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
