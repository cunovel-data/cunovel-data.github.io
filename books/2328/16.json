Heroin\u0027s been looking real good lately.\"\n \"Nobody ever said it was going to be easy, Pete.\"\n \"It was easy for a while. It\u0027s harder now.\"\n In the car he took up the theme again. \"I think, why bother? Or I go to a meeting and I\u0027m like, who are these people? Where are they coming from? All this shit about turning everything over to a Higher Power and then life\u0027s a piece of cake. You believe in that?\"\n \"That life\u0027s a piece of cake? Not quite.\"\n \"More like a shit sandwich. No, do you believe in God?\"\n \"It depends when you ask me.\"\n \"Well, today. That\u0027s when I\u0027m asking you. Do you believe in God?\" I didn\u0027t say anything at first, and he said, \"Never mind, I got no right to pry. Sorry.\"\n \"No, I was just trying to come up with an answer. I guess the reason I\u0027m having trouble is I don\u0027t think the question\u0027s important.\"\n \"It\u0027s not important whether there\u0027s a God or not?\"\n \"Well, what difference does it make? Either way I\u0027ve got the day to get through. God or no God, I\u0027m an alcoholic who can\u0027t drink safely. What\u0027s the difference?\"\n \"The program\u0027s all about a Higher Power.\"\n \"Yes, but it works the same whether He exists or not, and whether I believe in Him or not.\"\n \"How can you turn over your will to something you don\u0027t believe in?\"\n \"By letting go. By not trying to control things. By taking appropriate action and letting things work out the way God wants them to.\"\n \"Whether He exists or not.\"\n \"Right.\"\n He thought about it for a moment. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I grew up believing in God. I went to parochial school, I learned what they teach you. I never questioned it. I got sober, they said get a Higher Power, okay, no problem. Then when those fuckers send Francey back in pieces, man, what kind of a God lets something like that happen?\"\n \"Shit happens.\"\n \"You never knew her, man. She was a really good woman. Sweet, decent, innocent. A beautiful human being. Being around her made you want to be a better human being yourself. More than that. It made you feel like you could.\" He braked at a red light, looked both ways, went on through it. \"Got a ticket like that once. Middle of the night, I stop, there\u0027s no one for miles in either direction, so what kind of idiot stands there waiting for the light to change? Fucking cop\u0027s lying doggo halfway down the block with his lights out, gives me a ticket.\"\n \"I think we got away with it this time.\"\n \"Looks like it. Kenan uses smack now and then. I don\u0027t know if you knew that.\"\n \"How would I know it?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t figure you did. Maybe once a month he\u0027ll snort up a bag. Maybe less than that. It\u0027s recreational with him, he\u0027ll go to a jazz club and do up a bag in the john so that he can get into the music better. The thing is, he didn\u0027t let Francey know. He was sure she wouldn\u0027t approve, and he didn\u0027t want to do anything that would lower him in her eyes.\"\n \"Did she know he trafficked in it?\"\n \"That was different. That was business, that was what he did. And he wasn\u0027t going to stay in it forever. A few years and out, that\u0027s his plan.\"\n \"That\u0027s everybody\u0027s plan.\"\n \"I see what you\u0027re saying. Anyway, she was cool about it. It was something he did, it was his business, it was off to one side in a separate world. But he didn\u0027t want her to know he used sometimes.\" He was silent for a beat. Then he said, \"He was stoned the other day. I called him on it and he denied it. I mean, fuck, man, he\u0027s gonna deceive a junkie on the subject of dope? Man\u0027s obviously high and swears he\u0027s not. I guess it\u0027s because I\u0027m clean and sober, he don\u0027t want to put temptation in front of me, but give me credit for some basic intelligence, huh?\"\n \"Does it bother you that he can get high and you can\u0027t?\"\n \"Does it bother me? Of course it fucking bothers me. He\u0027s going to Europe tomorrow.\"\n \"He told me.\"\n \"Like he\u0027s got to do a deal right away, build up the cash. That\u0027s a good way to get arrested, rushing into deals. Or worse than arrested.\"\n \"Are you worried about him?\"\n \"Jesus,\" he said. \"I\u0027m worried about all of us.\"\n ON the bridge back to Manhattan he said, \"When I was a kid I loved bridges. I collected pictures of them. My old man got it into his head that I should be an architect.\"\n \"You still could, you know.\"\n He laughed. \"What, go back to school? No, see, I never wanted that for myself. I didn\u0027t have an inclination to build bridges. I just liked to look at \u0027em. I ever get the urge to pack it in, maybe I\u0027ll do a Brodie off the Brooklyn Bridge. Be something to change your mind halfway down, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\n \"I heard a guy qualify once. He came out of a blackout on one of the bridges, I think it was this one, on the other side of the railing and with one foot in space.\"\n \"Seriously?\"\n \"He sounded pretty serious to me. No memory of having gone there, just whammo, there he is with one hand on the rail and one foot in the air. He climbed back and went home.\"\n \"And had a drink, probably.\"\n \"I would think so. But imagine if he came to five seconds later.\"\n \"You mean after he took another step? Be a horrible feeling, wouldn\u0027t it? Only good thing about it is it wouldn\u0027t last long. Oh, shit, I should have got in the other lane. That\u0027s all right, we\u0027ll go a few blocks out of our way. I like it down here, anyway. You get down here much, Matt?\"\n We were driving around the South Street Seaport, a restored area around the Fulton Street fish market. \"Last summer,\" I said, \"my girlfriend and I spent the afternoon, walked around the shops, ate at one of the restaurants.\"\n \"It\u0027s a little yuppied up, but I like it. Not in the summer, though. You know when it\u0027s nicest? On a night like this when it\u0027s cold and empty and you\u0027ve got a light rain falling. That\u0027s when it\u0027s really beautiful down here.\" He laughed. \"Now that,\" he said, \"is a stone junkie talking, man. Show him the Garden of Eden and he\u0027ll say he wants it dark and cold and miserable. An\u0027 he wants to be the only one there.\"\n IN front of my hotel he said, \"Thanks, Matt.\"\n \"For what? I was planning on going to a meeting. I should be thanking you for the ride.\"\n \"Yeah, well, thanks for the company. Before you go, one thing I\u0027ve been meaning to ask you all night. This job you\u0027re doing for Kenan. You think you got much of a chance of getting anyplace with it?\"\n \"I\u0027m not just going through the motions.\"\n \"No, I realize you\u0027re giving it your best shot. I just wondered if you figured there was much chance it would pay off.\"\n \"There\u0027s a chance,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know how good it is. I didn\u0027t start out with a lot to work with.\"\n \"I realize that. You started with next to nothing, the way it looked to me. Of course you\u0027re looking at it from a professional standpoint, you\u0027re going to see it differently.\"\n \"A lot depends on whether some of the actions I\u0027m taking lead anywhere, Pete. And their actions in the future are a factor, too, and they\u0027re impossible to foresee. Am I optimistic? It depends when you ask me.\"\n \"Same as your Higher Power, huh? The thing is, if you come to the conclusion that it\u0027s hopeless, don\u0027t be in a rush to tell my brother, huh? Stay on it an extra week or two. So he\u0027ll think he did everything he can.\"\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"What I mean-\"\n \"I know what you mean,\" I said. \"The thing is, it\u0027s not something I have to be told. I\u0027ve always been a stubborn son of a bitch. When I start something I have a hell of a time letting go of it. I think that\u0027s the main way I solve things, to tell you the truth. I don\u0027t do it by being brilliant. I just hang on like a bulldog until something shakes loose.\"\n \"And sooner or later something does? I know they used to say nobody gets away with murder.\"\n \"Is that what they used to say? They don\u0027t say it much anymore. People get away with murder all the time.\" I got out of the car, then leaned in to finish the thought. \"That\u0027s in one sense,\" I said, \"but in another sense they don\u0027t. I don\u0027t honestly think anybody ever gets away with anything.\"\n Chapter 9\n I was up late that night. I tried sleeping and couldn\u0027t, tried reading and couldn\u0027t, and wound up sitting in the dark at my window, looking out at the rain falling through the light of the streetlamps. I sat and thought long thoughts. \"The thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\" I read that line in a poem once, but you can think long thoughts at any age, if you can\u0027t sleep and there\u0027s a light rain falling.\n I was still in bed when the phone rang around ten. TJ said, \"You got a pen, Glenn? You want to get one, write this down.\" He reeled off a pair of seven-digit numbers. \"Better write down seven-one-eight, too, \u0027cause you got to dial that first.\"\n \"Who will I get if I do?\"\n \"Woulda got me, was you home first time I called you. Man you harder to get than lucky! Called you Friday afternoon, called you Friday night, called you yesterday all day and all night up until midnight. You a hard man to reach.\"\n \"I was out.\"\n \"Well, I more or less \u0027stablished that. Man, that was some trip you sent me on. Ol\u0027 Brooklyn, it go on for days.\"\n \"There\u0027s a lot of it,\" I agreed.\n \"More than you\u0027d have a need for. First place I went, rode to the end of the line. Train came up above ground and I got to see some pretty houses. Looked like an old-time town in a movie, not like New York at all. Got to the first phone, called you. Nobody home. Went chasin\u0027 out to the next phone, and man, that was a trip. I went down some streets that the people looked at me like, nigger, what you doin\u0027 here? Didn\u0027t nobody say anything, but you didn\u0027t have to listen real hard to hear what they thinkin\u0027.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t have any trouble.\"\n \"Man, I never have trouble. What I do, I make it a point to see trouble \u0027fore trouble sees me. I found the second telephone, called you a second time. Didn\u0027t get you \u0027cause you wasn\u0027t there to be got. So I thinkin\u0027, hey, maybe I\u0027m closer to some other subway, on account of I am miles from where I get off the last one. So I go into this candy store, say, like, \u0027Can you tell me where the nearest subway station is?\u0027 I say it like that, you know, you woulda thought you was hearin\u0027 an announcer on TV. Man looks at me, says, \u0027Subway?\u0027 Like it not just a word he don\u0027t know, it a whole concept he can\u0027t get his mind around. So I just went back the way I came, man, back to the end of the Flatbush line, \u0027cause at least I knew how to do that.\"\n \"I think that was probably the closest station anyway.\"\n \"I think you right, \u0027cause I looked at subway map later an\u0027 I couldn\u0027t see one closer. One more reason to stay in Manhattan, man. You never far from a train.\"\n \"I\u0027ll keep it in mind.\"\n \"I sure was hopin\u0027 you be there when I called. Had it all set, I run the number by you, say, \u0027Call it right now.\u0027 You dial, I pick up an\u0027 say, \u0027Here I am.\u0027 Tellin\u0027 you about it now it don\u0027t seem all that cool, but I couldn\u0027t wait to do it.\"\n \"I gather the phones had the numbers posted.\"\n \"Oh, right! That\u0027s what I left out. Second one, the one way to hell an\u0027 gone out Veterans Avenue? Where everybody look at you real strange? That phone did have the number posted. The other one, Flatbush an\u0027 Farragut, it didn\u0027t.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-16.html","bookId":2328,"book":{"id":2328,"title":"A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10)","description":"Storyline: \n A Walk Among the Tombstones (Matthew Scudder #10) \n The wife of Kheran Khoury, heroin wholesaler, is killed after he haggles over the price of her ransom.
