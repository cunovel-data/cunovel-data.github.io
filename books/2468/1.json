{"id":82053,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\"How are you feeling?\" The young man attempted a shrug but didn\u0027t have the energy to actually lift his shoulders. \" \u0027M okay,\" he muttered, watching the doctor warily. The incision throbbed, and he was too tired to take a piss without the huge orderly holding his pecker, but he wasn\u0027t going to tell the doctor that. Some people said he had authority problems. So what. He had his money; all he wanted now was a chance to spend it. \"When can I go?\" \"Go?\" \"Leave,\" he growled. \"That\u0027s what I came in to tell you.\" Her face ex?pressionless, she stepped away from the bed. \"You\u0027ll be leaving this afternoon.\" \"When?\" \"Soon.\" When she was gone, he swung his legs out from under the covers and carefully lowered them to the floor. Straightening slowly, he released the rail and stepped forward. The room whirled. He would have fallen except that a beefy hand wrapped around his arm and effortlessly kept him upright. \"You walk too fuckin\u0027 quietly, man,\" he said, turn?ing to face the orderly. \"Damn near scared me to d... \" The last word got lost in sudden pain as the fin?gers tightened. \"Hey, man! You\u0027re hurting me!\" \"I know.\" Something glittered in the depths of soft brown eyes, something usually buried beneath an expression of unquestionable docility. The setting sun brushed molten gold over the waves of English Bay, gilded a pair of joggers on Sunset Beach Park, traced currents of gleaming amber be?tween the shores of False Creek, shone through the tinted glass on the fourteenth floor of the Pacific Place condominium tower and into the eyes of a young man who sighed as he watched it set. Nestled between the mountains and the Strait of Georgia, Vancouver, Brit?ish Columbia, enjoyed some of the most beautiful sun?sets in the world-but that had nothing to do with the young man\u0027s sigh. Lifting a hand to shade his face, Tony Foster stared out the window and counted down the minutes. At 7:22 P.M., his watch alarm began to buzz. Pale blue eyes still locked on the horizon, he shut it off and cocked his head back toward the interior of the condo-minium, listening for the sounds that would tell him the night had truly begun. Lying in a darkness so complete it could only be deliberate, Henry Fitzroy shook off the bindings of the sun. The soft sound of the cotton sheet moving against the rise and fall of his chest told him he had safely survived another day. As he listened, the rhyth?mic whisper became lost in the heartbeat waiting in the room beyond his bolted door and then in the myr?iad noises of the city beyond the walls of his sanctuary. He hated the way he woke, hated the extended vul?nerability of his slow return to full consciousness. Every evening he tried to shorten the time he spent lying helpless and semiaware. It didn\u0027t seem to do any good, but the effort made him feel less impotent. He could feel the sheet lying against his skin, the utter stillness of the air.... And a sudden chill. Which was impossible. He\u0027d had the air conditioner disconnected in this, the smallest of the three bedrooms. The window had been blocked with plywood, caulked, and curtained. The door had flexible rubber seals around all four sides-not air-tight by any means, but the cracks were far too small to allow such a rapid change in temperature. Then he realized that he wasn\u0027t alone. Someone was in the room with him. Someone with no scent. No heartbeat. Fleshless. Bloodless. Demonic? Possibly. It wouldn\u0027t be the first time he\u0027d faced one of the Lords of Hell. Forcing a sluggish arm to move, Henry reached over and switched on a lamp. Sensitive eyes half closed-even forty-watt bulbs threw enough light to temporarily blind-he caught one quick glimpse of a young man standing at the foot of his bed before the faint, translucent image disappeared. \"A ghost?\" Tony propped one leg on the wide arm of the green leather couch and shook his head. \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\" \"Wrong.\" \"Cool. I wonder what he wants. They always want something,\" he added in answer to the question im?plicit in Henry\u0027s lifted red-gold brow. \"Everyone knows that.\" \"Do they?\" \"Come on, Henry. Don\u0027t tell me in four-hundred-and-ninety-five odd years you\u0027ve never seen a ghost?\" One hand flat against the cool glass of the window, the other hooked in the pocket of his jeans, Henry Fitzroy, bastard son of Henry VIII, once Duke of Richmond and Somerset, remembered a night in the late 1800s when he\u0027d watched the specter of a terrified young queen run screaming down the hall to beg her king once more for a mercy she\u0027d never receive. Over two hundred years before, Katherine Howard had at?tended his wedding to her cousin Mary. He hadn\u0027t gone to hers-her marriage to his father had occurred four years after his supposed death. Made a queen in July, 1540, she\u0027d been beheaded in February, 1542, nineteen months later. She\u0027d been young and foolish and very likely guilty of the adultery she\u0027d been charged with, but she hadn\u0027t deserved to have her spirit trapped, replaying over and over the soul-destroying moment when she\u0027d realized she was going to die. \"Henry?\" \"Whatever he wants,\" Henry said without turning, \"I doubt that I\u0027ll be able to give it to him. I can\u0027t change the past.\" Tony shivered. The centuries had gathered about the other man in a nearly visible cloud, wrapping him in a shroud of time and memory. \"Henry, you\u0027re freaking me out.\" \"Am I? Sorry.\" Shaking off his melancholy, the ex-prince turned and managed a wry smile. \"You seem somewhat nonchalant about being haunted.\" Glad to have him back, Tony shrugged, a trace of the street kid he\u0027d been lingering in the jerky move?ment. \"He\u0027s haunting you, not me. And besides, be?tween living with you for the last two years and dealing with the weirdos at the store, I\u0027ve learned to take the unexpected in stride.\" \"Have you?\" Not at all pleased with being com?pared to the weirdos at the video store where Tony worked, Henry\u0027s smile broadened, showing teeth. When he heard the younger man\u0027s heartbeat quicken, he crossed the room and wrapped an ivory hand around a slender shoulder. \"So I\u0027ve lost the ability to surprise you?\" \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" Tony\u0027s breathing grew ragged as a cool thumb traced the line of his jaw. \"Perhaps not exactly that.\" \"Uh, Henry... \" \"What?\" He shook his head. It was enough to know Henry would stop if he wanted him to. More than enough, considering he didn\u0027t want him to. \"Never mind. Not important.\" A short while later, teeth met through a fold of skin, the sharp points pierced a vein and, for a time, the dead were washed away with the blood of the living. The warm evening air lapping against her face, Cor?poral Phyllis Roberts cruised along Commissioner Street humming the latest Celine Dion hit and tapping her fingers against the top of the steering wheel. Al?though the new Ports Canada Police cars had air-conditioning, she never used it as she disliked the en?closed, spaceship feeling of driving with the windows rolled up. Three hours into her shift, she was in a good mood. So far, nothing had gone wrong. Three hours and fifteen minutes into her shift, Cor?poral Roberts stopped humming. Turning into Vanterm, as of this moment her least favorite of the harbor\u0027s twenty-seven cargo and cruise ship terminals, Corporal Roberts squinted to make out the tiny figures of three men dwarfed by the bulk of a Singapore-registered container ship. The pole lights that turned the long wooden pier into a patchwork of stacked containers and hard-edged shadows washed away features so thoroughly she was almost on top of them before she recognized one of the men. Leaving her cap in the car, she picked up her long, rubber-handled flashlight, touched her nightstick, more out of habit than any thought she might have to use it, and walked toward them. \"You night-loading, Ted?\" Ted Polich, the shortest of the three longshoremen, jerked a balding head upward at the gantry crane that loomed over the dock like a mechanical bird of prey. \"Controls have stiffened up and the son of a bitch is jerking left. We\u0027re trying to get it fixed tonight, so it doesn\u0027t slow loading tomorrow.\" \"God forbid,\" the corporal muttered. A huge in?crease in Pacific Rim trade had the port scrambling to keep up. \"Where is it?\" \"Up by the bow. It\u0027s caught in one of them eddies between the dock and the ship.\" Falling into step be?side her, Polich shoved his hands in the pockets of grimy overalls. \"We figured they\u0027d send the city police.\" \"Sorry. You\u0027re stuck with me until we know for sure you saw what you said you did.\" \"You think we made it up?\" asked one of the other men indignantly, leaning around his companion to glare at the cop. Corporal Roberts shook her head and sighed. \"I couldn\u0027t possibly be that lucky.\" She wasn\u0027t. Bobbing up and down in the narrow triangle be?tween the bow and the dock was the body of a naked man, his back a pale, flesh-colored island, the strands of his hair sweeping against it like dark seaweed. \"Shit.\" Polich nodded. \"That\u0027s what I said. You figure he\u0027s a jumper?\" \"I doubt it.\" While they did occasionally get jump?ers off the Lions Gate Bridge, they hadn\u0027t had one yet who\u0027d stopped to take his clothes off. Pointing her flashlight beam at the water, she slowly swept the cir?cle of illumination over the corpse. Bruises, large and small, made a mottled pattern of purple against the pale skin. Not very old-and not going to get any older, she told herself grimly-he hadn\u0027t been in the water for long. \"Funny what makes some of \u0027em float and some of \u0027em sink,\" Polich mused quietly beside her. \"This guy\u0027s skin and bones, should\u0027a gone right to the... God damn it! Would you look at that!\" The other two longshoremen crowded in to see. Flung forward, Corporal Roberts tottered on the edge of the pier, saved at the last minute from a po?tentially dangerous swim by a muscular arm thrust in front of her like a filthy, cloth-covered, safety rail. Breathing heavily, she thanked Polich and snarled a warning at the other two. As they backed up, too intent on the body in the water to be properly penitent, one of them muttered, \"What the hell could\u0027ve happened to his hands?\" Sunset the next night occurred behind cloud cover so heavy only the fading light gave evidence that the sun had set at all. At 7:23, Tony turned off his watch alarm and muted the inane conversation filling in a rain delay for a Seattle Mariners\u0027 home game. Who wanted to hear about a shortage of organ donors when they were waiting to watch baseball? He never dreamed he\u0027d miss Fergie Oliver. Leaning back in his chair, he glanced down the hall, listening for the first sounds of Henry\u0027s return and straining to hear the rattle of ghostly chains. As the sun released its hold and his senses slowly began to function, Henry sifted through and ignored a hundred familiar sensations. An impossible breeze stroked icy fingers across his cheek. He willed his arm to move and switched on the lamp. The ghost stood where it had the day before-a nondescript young man, needing a haircut and shave, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. Its edges were indistinct and although Henry could see writing on the shirt, he couldn\u0027t make it out-whether because the writing hadn\u0027t fully materialized or because the items on the dresser behind the ghost\u0027s semitranslucent torso distracted him, he wasn\u0027t sure. As far as Henry could remember, he\u0027d never seen the young man alive. He half expected the specter to vanish when he sat up, but it remained at the foot of his bed. It\u0027s waiting for something. If a noncorporeal being could be said to have posture, the ghost\u0027s stance screamed anticipation. \"All right.\" He sighed and leaned back against the headboard. \"What do you want?\" Slowly, the ghost lifted its arms and vanished. Henry stared a moment longer at the place where it had been and wondered what could have possibly happened to its hands. \"It had no hands at all?\" When Henry nodded, Tony chewed his lower lip in thought. \"Were they, like, cut off or ripped off or chewed off or what?\" he asked after a moment. \"They just weren\u0027t there.\" Henry took a bottle of water out of the fridge, opened it, and drained it. The growing popularity of bottled water had been a god?send; while blood provided total nourishment, all liv?ing things required water, and the purifying chemicals added by most cities made him ill. Bacteria, his system ignored. Chlorine, it rebelled against. Tossing the empty plastic bottle in the recycling bin, he leaned on the counter and stared down at his own hands. \"They just weren\u0027t there,\" he repeated. \"Then I bet that\u0027s what he wants-vengeance. They always want vengeance.\" Raising an eyebrow at Tony\u0027s certainty, Henry asked just where he\u0027d acquired his knowledge of what ghosts always wanted. \"You know, movies and stuff. He wants you to help him take revenge against the guy who took his hands.\" \"And how am I supposed to do that?\" \"Jeez, Henry, I don\u0027t know. You worked with Vicki; didn\u0027t she teach you nothing?\" \"Anything.\" Tony rolled his eyes. \"Okay, anything.\" Vicki Nelson, private investigator, ex-police detec?tive, ex-lover, vampire-Henry had worked with her for one short year before fate had brought them as close together as was possible with his kind and then had driven them apart. He\u0027d been forced to change her to save her life and forced, by the change, to give her up. Highly territorial, vampires hunted alone. She\u0027d returned to Toronto and her mortal lover. He\u0027d made a new life for himself on the West Coast. Had she taught him anything? Yes. Did any of it have anything to do with handless ghosts? No. When he repeated his thoughts aloud for Tony\u0027s benefit, he added, \"One thing she did teach me is that I\u0027m not a detective. I\u0027m a writer, and, if you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027m going to go write.\" Not entirely certain why memories of Vicki Nelson always made him so defen?sive, he headed for his computer, waving at the televi?sion on his way through the living room. \"Your rain delay seems to be over.\" Half an hour later, having realized that the expected staccato clicking of keys hadn\u0027t yet begun, Tony pushed open the door to Henry\u0027s office. Standing on the threshold, he noted that nothing showed on the monitor but a chapter heading and a lot of blank screen. \"This spook really has you spooked, doesn\u0027t it?\" \"Why do you say that?\" Henry asked without turning. \"You\u0027re just sitting there, staring at your hands.\" \"Maybe I was deep in thought.\" \"Henry, you write bodice rippers. There\u0027s a limit to how much deep thought is allowed.\" Seventeen years a royal duke, over four hundred and fifty years a vampire, it had taken Henry a while to recognize when he was being teased. Once or twice, Tony had come close to not surviving the adjustment. Lifting his gaze from his hands, he sighed. \"All I can think of is, why me.\" He laughed, but the sound held no humor. \"Which seems a little self-centered since I\u0027m merely being haunted and was not the one killed and mutilated.\" Pushing his ergonomic chair away from the desk, he spun it around and stood. \"I need to get out. Be distracted.\" \"Great.\" Tony grinned. \"Bram Stoker\u0027s Dracula is playing at midnight at the Caprice.\" \"Why not.\" Enjoying Tony\u0027s poleaxed expression, Henry turned the young man about and pushed him gently out of the doorway. \"I hear Gary Oldman is terrific.\" \"You hear?\" Tony sputtered as Henry\u0027s inarguable touch moved him down the hall. \"You heard it from me! And when I told you, you told me that you never go to vampire movies-that\u0027s why not.\" \"I changed my mind.\" Unable to resist, he added, \"Maybe we can get a bite while we\u0027re downtown.\" The elevators in the Pacific Place towers were as fast and as quiet as money could make them. With his fingertips resting lightly on the brushed steel doors, Henry cocked his head and smiled. \"It sounds like Lisa\u0027s shredding the character of another cabbie.\" Tony winced. \"Man, I\u0027m glad she likes us.\" As the chime announced the arrival of the elevator, the two men stepped away from the doors. \"Hello, boys.\" One gloved hand clutching the arm of her paid companion, Lisa Evans grinned a very expensive and perfect grin as she shuffled into the corridor. The gleaming white teeth between glistening red lips added a ghastly emphasis to the skull-like ef?fect created when age finally triumphed over years of cosmetic surgery. \"Heading out for a late night on the town?\" \"Just a midnight movie,\" Henry told her as Tony stopped the doors from closing. He scooped up her free hand and raised it to his lips. \"And you, I expect, have been out breaking hearts?\" \"At my age? Don\u0027t be ridiculous.\" She pulled her hand free and smacked him lightly on the cheek, then turned on her companion. \"And what are you smiling about, Munro?\" Not the least bit chastised, Mrs. Munro continued to smile down at her elderly employer. \"I was just thinking about Mr. Swanson.\" \"Swanson\u0027s interested in my money, not these old bones.\" But she preened a little and patted the head of the mink stole she wore over a raw silk suit. Once the mistress of a Vancouver lumber baron, she\u0027d made a number of shrewd investments and parlayed a comfortable nest egg into a tidy fortune. \"And besides, I\u0027m not interested in him. All the good men are dead.\" Sweeping a twinkling gaze over Henry and Tony, she added, \"Or gay.\" \"Miss Evans!\" \"Chill out, Munro. I\u0027m not telling them anything they don\u0027t know.\" Companion chastised, she turned her attention back to the two men. \"We\u0027ve just come from one of those tedious fund-raising things they ex?pect you to attend when you have money. Organs, I think it was tonight.\" \"Organs?\" Henry repeated with a smile, fully aware that Lisa Evans enjoyed those tedious fund-raising things where her checkbook ensured she\u0027d be stroked and flattered. He also knew that if she was vague, it was deliberate-no one made the kind of money she had without knowing exactly where every dollar ended up. \"Musical or medical?\" \"Medical.\" Heavily shadowed eyes narrowed into a look that had been known to send a variety of CEOs running for cover. \"Have you signed an organ donor card?\" \"I\u0027m afraid they wouldn\u0027t want my organs.\" The look softened slightly as she leaped to the con?clusion he\u0027d intended. \"Oh. I\u0027m sorry. Still, while there\u0027s life, there\u0027s hope, and medical science is doing wonders these days.\" She grinned. \"I mean, it\u0027s a won?der I\u0027m still alive.\" Pulling her companion down the hall, rather in the manner of a pilot boat guiding a tanker into harbor, she threw a cheery, \"Don\u0027t do anything I wouldn\u0027t do,\" back over her shoulder. \"Well, that leaves us a lot of leeway,\" Henry mur?mured as the elevator door closed on Mrs. Munro\u0027s continuing shocked protests. Tony sagged against the back wall, hands shoved in his pockets. \"Until I met Miss Evans, I always thought old ladies were kind of vague and smelly. Maybe you should send your ghost over to her.\" \"Why?\" \"If all the good men are dead... \" \"Or gay,\" Henry reminded him. \"Suppose he turned out to be both? I\u0027d hate to get on Lisa\u0027s bad side.\" The thought of Lisa Evans\u0027 bad side brought an exaggerated shudder. \"Actually, I\u0027ve been meaning to ask you; how come you\u0027re so friendly with everybody in the building? You\u0027re always talking to people. I\u0027d have thought it would be safer to be a little more ...\" \"Reclusive?\" \"Big word. I was going to say private, but I guess that\u0027ll do.\" \"People are afraid of what they don\u0027t know.\" Exit?ing into the underground garage, they walked in step to Henry\u0027s BMW. \"If people think they know me, they aren\u0027t afraid of me. If a rumor begins that I am not what I seem, they\u0027ll match it against what they think they know and discount it. If they have nothing to match it against, then they\u0027re more likely to be?lieve it.\" \"So you make friends with people as a kind of camouflage?\" Frowning slightly, Henry watched Tony circle around to the passenger door. \"Not always.\" \"But sometimes?\" \"Yes.\" With the car between them, Tony lifted his head and locked his eyes on Henry\u0027s face. \"And what about me?\" \"You?\" \"What am I? Am I camouflage?\" \"Tony... \" Then he saw the expression in Tony\u0027s eyes and realized that it hadn\u0027t been a facetious ques?tion. \"Tony, I trust you with everything I am. There\u0027re only two other people in the world I can say that about, and one of them doesn\u0027t exactly count.\" \"Because Vicki\u0027s become a vampire?\" \"Because Michael Celluci would never admit to knowing a ... romance writer.\" Tony laughed, as he was meant to, but Henry heard the artificial resonance. For the rest of the night, he worked hard at erasing it. She\u0027d seen the article too late to do anything about it that night, and the wait had not improved her temper. \"Is Richard Sullivan on duty?\" Startled, the edge on the words having cut her mem?ory to shreds, the nurse checked the duty sheet. \"Yes, Doctor. He... \" \"I want to see him in my office. Immediately.\" \"Yes, Doctor.\" No point in protesting that he was cleaning up an unfortunate bedpan accident. Immediately meant immediately and no later. As she paged him, the nurse hoped that whatever Sullivan had done, it wasn\u0027t enough to get him fired. Orderlies willing to do the shit work without bitching and complaining were few and far between. Besides, it was difficult not to like the big man; those puppy dog eyes were hard to resist. \"What do you know about this?\" Sullivan looked down at the article and then up at the doctor. Denial died unspoken as she read his an?swer off his face. \"This is one of ours?\" He nodded. \"Then what part of my instructions did you not understand?\" \"It\u0027s not that I ...\" \"Or do you not enjoy your job? Is it not everything I told you it would be?\" \"Yes. I mean, I do. And it is, but... \" \"You are not supposed to be showing initiative, Mr. Sullivan.\" Their relative sizes made it ridiculous that he should cower before her temper, but he did anyway. The ghost was wearing a Cult and Jackyl T-shirt, a local band that recorded in North Vancouver. Henry was a little surprised it wasn\u0027t a Grateful Dead T-shirt. He\u0027d often suspected the universe had a really maca?bre, and pretty basic, sense of humor. Its arms still ended just above the wrist. Again, it seemed to be waiting. Tony believed it wanted vengeance. I suppose that\u0027s as good a theory as any, Henry re?flected. He sighed. \"Do you want revenge on the per?son who took your hands?\" Impatience adding a first hint of personality to translucent features, the ghost slowly faded away. Henry sighed again. \"I take it that\u0027s a qualified yes.\" The apartment was empty when he emerged from his room. After a moment, he remembered it was Sat?urday and Tony would be working late. \"Which is probably a good thing,\" he announced to the lights of the city. He wondered if the ghost ex?pected him to begin by finding the hands, and if he should be looking for the remains of flesh and bone or an ethereal pair quite possibly haunting someone else. When Tony returned home after midnight, he was in his office with the door closed, deep in the compli?cated court politics of 1813 and more than a little con?cerned with his heroine\u0027s refusal to follow the plot as outlined. Dawn nearly caught him still trying to decide whether Wellington would promote her betrothed to full colonel and he raced for the sanctuary of his bed having forgotten his spectral visitor in the night\u0027s work. \"This is becoming irritating; do you at least know who has your hands?\" The ghost threw back its head and screamed. No sound emerged from the gaping black hole of a mouth, but Henry felt the hair lift off the back of his neck and a cold dread wrap around his heart. While the scream endured, he thought he sensed a multitude of spirits within the scream; all shrieking in unison, all lamenting the injustice of their deaths. His lips drew off his teeth in an involuntary snarl. \"Henry? Henry! Are you okay?\" The ghost\u0027s face, distended by the continuing scream, faded last. \"Henry!\" It took him a moment to realize that the pounding wasn\u0027t his heart-it was Tony, banging frantically on the bedroom door. He shook himself free of the lin?gering uneasiness and padded across the room, the carpet cold and damp against his bare feet. Releasing the bolts, he called, \"I\u0027m all right.\" When he opened the door, Tony nearly fell into his arms. Eyes wide, panting as though he\u0027d just run a race, Tony pulled back far enough to see for himself that Henry was unharmed. \"I heard... no, I felt ... it was... \" His fingers tightened around Henry\u0027s bare shoulders. \"What happened? Was it the ghost?\" \"I\u0027m only guessing, but I think I asked it a question with a negative answer.\" \"Negative?\" Tony\u0027s voice rose to an incredulous squeak and he let his arms drop to his side. \"I\u0027ll say it was negative. It was bottom of the pit, soul-sucking, annihilation!\" \"It wasn\u0027t that bad... \" \"Maybe not for you!\" Concerned, Henry studied Tony\u0027s face. \"Are you all right?\" \"I guess.\" He drew in a deep breath, released it slowly, and nodded. \"Yeah. I\u0027m okay. But I\u0027m gonna stay right here and watch you dress.\" Propped up on one shoulder, he sagged against the doorframe, too frightened to be tough, or independent, or even inter?ested in Henry\u0027s nakedness. \"I don\u0027t want to be alone.\" \"Do you want to know what happened?\" From Tony\u0027s expression, it was clear that he hadn\u0027t needed to ask. While he pulled on his clothes, Henry de?scribed what had occurred when he\u0027d tried to get more information from the ghost. \"So, you can only ask one question and if the an?swer\u0027s yes, it disappears quietly, and if the answer\u0027s no, it lets you know how disappointed it is with you.\" \"Not only how disappointed it is,\" Henry told him. \"When it screamed, I sensed a multitude of the dead.\" \"Yeah? How many dead in a multitude, Henry?\" \"This is nothing to joke about.\" \"Trust me, I\u0027m not laughin\u0027 inside.\" Tony followed Henry into the living room, dropping gracelessly onto one end of the heavy leather sofa. \"Man, game shows from beyond the grave. You mind if I turn on some lights? That thing\u0027s still got me kind of spooked.\" When Henry indicated he should go ahead, he stretched back, flicked on the track lighting, and cen?tered himself in a circle of illumination. \"At least we know two things. It does want revenge, and it doesn\u0027t know where its hands are.\" \"What of the others?\" \"Can we maybe deal with this one ghost at a time? I mean, why borrow trouble.\" Tucked into a pocket of shadow on the other side of the room, Henry sighed. \"I\u0027d still like to know, why me?\" \"Like attracts like.\" Brows drawn in, Henry leaned forward, bringing his face into the light. \"I beg your pardon.\" \"You\u0027re a vampire.\" Tony shrugged and stroked the tiny, nearly healed wound barely visible against the tanned skin of his left wrist. \"Even if you\u0027re not a supernatural creature, even if all you are is biologi?cally different... \" \"All I am?\" \"Henry!\" Henry graciously indicated he should continue al?though his lip remained curled. \"Look, there\u0027s a whole shitload of myth about you. Okay, not you specifically, but about your kind. It\u0027s all around you... \" He spread his arms. \"... like a kind of metaphysical fog. I bet that\u0027s what the ghost is attracted to. I bet that\u0027s what pulls him to you.\" \"Metaphysical fog,\" Henry repeated. Shaking his head, he leaned back in his chair. \"Did you talk like that in Toronto?\" \"You needn\u0027t get so damned superior!\" His relaxed posture gone, Tony jabbed a finger in Henry\u0027s direction. \"It\u0027s a perfectly valid theory. Or have you got a better one?\" Surprised by the young man\u0027s vehemence, Henry admitted he didn\u0027t, but before Tony could continue, he cut him off with an uplifted hand. \"Something\u0027s happening in the hall.\" Tony\u0027s scowl deepened. \"I don\u0027t hear any... shit.\" There was no point in continuing. Henry was already at the door. He\u0027d heard the ambulance attendants. As he stepped out into the hall, they were rolling the stretcher out of apartment 1404. The tiny figure under the straps lay perfectly still, one thin hand dangling limply off the side. The attendants were performing CPR even as they rushed toward the elevator, but Henry knew Lisa Evans was irretrievably dead. He barely managed to keep himself from leaping back and snarling as Mrs. Munro clutched at his arm. A few moments later, after bundling the sobbing companion into his car, he was speeding toward St. Paul\u0027s Hospital after the ambulance while Tony passed Mrs. Munro tissue after tissue from the box in the glove compartment. The emergency room doctors took very little time before they agreed with Henry\u0027s diagnosis. They, too, had seen death too often to mistake it. \"She was very old,\" Dr. Zvane told them softly. \"There\u0027s older!\" Mrs. Munro protested. Tony handed her another tissue. \"True.\" The doctor shrugged, and knuckled weary eyes. \"All I can say is that it was her time. We did everything we could, but she\u0027d gone on and had no intention of coming back.\" Gripping Henry\u0027s hand hard enough to crack merely mortal joints, Mrs. Munro sniffed. \"That\u0027s just like her. You could never get her to change her mind once she\u0027d made it up.\" She\u0027d stopped crying by the time she got back into the car. Although Henry had offered to drive her wherever she wanted to go, she\u0027d asked to be taken back to the condo. \"I have to get my things. My daughter will pick me up there. \"We were watching Jeopardy,\" she continued, able to talk about what had happened now that it was offi?cially over. \"It was the championship round. Miss Evans had just shouted out, \u0027Who is Captain Kirk?\u0027 when all of a sudden, she sort of whimpered and clapped her hands over her ears. She looked like she\u0027d heard something horrible except I didn\u0027t hear anything at all. The next thing I knew, she was... gone.\" Henry met Tony\u0027s eyes in the rearview mirror. It was obvious they were thinking the same thing. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s doing it deliberately.\" \"I don\u0027t care. He is responsible for that old lady\u0027s death, and I say he can go handless into hell.\" Back in his circle of light, Tony shivered. Henry\u0027s voice had cut through the distance between living room and bedroom like the distance didn\u0027t exist, and every word had held an edge. When he appeared a moment later, Tony took in his change of clothes- his face and hair seemed luminescent above all that black-and asked, although he didn\u0027t really need to, \"Where are you going?\" \"Hunting.\" It was almost impossible not to respond to the ghost\u0027s anticipation. \"You can stand there as long as you like,\" Henry growled, \"but I am not going to help you.\" The ghost threw back its head and screamed. An unseen, unheard chorus of the dead screamed with it. \"I thought you weren\u0027t going to ask it any more questions!\" \"I didn\u0027t.\" Henry stared down at the city, listening for the sound of a siren, his fingers splayed against the glass, the muscles rigid across his back. \"I told it, it could expect no help.\" \"It didn\u0027t seem to like that.\" \"No. It didn\u0027t.\" They stood together in silence, waiting for the sounds of another death. Finally Tony sighed and threw himself down on the sofa. \"Looks like we got lucky; nobody old enough, close enough. Tomorrow night, why don\u0027t you say nothing at all.\" It waited. And it waited. When Henry tried to leave the room, it screamed. They watched the ambulance arrive. They learned that the Franklins\u0027 baby died in its sleep. \"Babies. Man... \" Two years ago, Tony had watched an ancient Egyptian wizard devour the life force of a baby. The parents walked on, completely unaware that their child was dead. He still had night?mares about it. \"This is blackmail.\" \"Yes. And it has made me angry.\" The plastic cracked in his grip as he picked up the phone. Swallowing nervously-Henry\u0027s anger could be as terrifying as silent ghostly screams-Tony managed a partial smile and asked, \"Calling the Ghostbusters?\" \"Not quite. I\u0027ve decided this is not a job for a ro?mance writer.\" \"Well, I guess not, but. . .\" He let his next question trail off when Henry activated the external speaker on the phone. After two rings, an answering machine clicked on. \"Victory Nelson, Private Investigations. There\u0027s no one here to take your call right now. Please leave a message after the tone.... \"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-debt-vicki-nelson-5/page-1.html","bookId":2468,"book":{"id":2468,"title":"Blood Debt (Vicki Nelson #5)","description":"Storyline: Blood Debt (Vicki Nelson #5) The book revolves around three main characters, Vicki Nelson, a Private Investigator and ex-cop, her lover, homicide detective Mike Celluci, and her ex-lover Henry Fitzroy, 450-year-old vampire, romance writer, and bastard son of Henry VIII.
