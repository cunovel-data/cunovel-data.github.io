{"id":100961,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\"THERE\u0027S nowhere to hide the car.\" \"Don\u0027t hide it. Pull into the parking lot, and park.\" \"It\u0027s after one,\" Henry pointed out as he passed the sign for Project Hope, turned between the gateposts, and started up the long drive. \"While normally I wouldn\u0027t consider arguing with your expertise in skulking about, don\u0027t you think we\u0027ll be noticed? There\u0027ll be a night nurse on at the very least.\" \"So?\" \"So, you\u0027re going to walk in and ask her if they\u0027ve got Detective Celluci strapped to a bed in one of the rooms?\" \"Why not?\" Her voice had very little of the police officer, of the private investigator, or the mortal left in it. Henry fought to suppress his reaction as she continued. \"It\u0027s not like I\u0027m going to be lied to. Be?sides, if he\u0027s in there, I\u0027ll know.\" \"And if he isn\u0027t?\" The ivory gleam of teeth made her smile a threat. \"I go looking for a big guy with cow eyes and ask him a few questions.\" Beyond the edges of her control, edges sharply enough denned to draw blood, Henry could hear the purging violence surging back and forth. She sounded close to letting go. Hardly surprising given the proxim?ity they\u0027d been in since leaving the clinic-the tension between them sat like a third presence in the car. He could feel his own barriers weakening and trying to convince himself that this was a continuation of the year they spent in a parent/child, teacher/student rela?tionship helped not at all. If the anticipated mayhem didn\u0027t materialize inside Project Hope, they\u0027d be at each other\u0027s throats before he got the keys back into the ignition. Vicki leaped from the car the instant it stopped moving and sucked in a lungful of air untainted by another\u0027s breathing. If it came to it, she decided, drag?ging her bag up onto her shoulder, she\u0027d walk back to the condo before she let Henry drive her anywhere, ever again. He slowed for yellow lights. He didn\u0027t pass when he could. He took corners too slowly. It had been the most frustrating fifty minutes she\u0027d ever spent. Only iron control had kept her from dragging him out from behind the wheel and taking over her-self. I have got to get my driver\u0027s license again. Lips pressed into a thin line, she strode toward the build?ing. \"Remember, Vicki, not being noticed is infi?nitely better than having to correct a dangerous impression.\" \"Christ, Henry. You sound like an old Kung Fu episode.\" He locked the car and hurried to catch up. \"I\u0027m speaking from experience. . .\" \"I know, I know, over four hundred and fifty years. No wonder you drive like an old woman,\" she added under her breath as she yanked open the clinic\u0027s cedar slab door. Half a dozen battling scents almost knocked her back outside-a bouquet of roses in a large glass vase, a chemical air freshener designed to mimic the ocean breezes kept out by hermetically sealed windows, and over, under, and through it all, the eau d\u0027 disinfectant worn by every medical establishment in the world. She could sense perhaps a dozen lives, the delinea?tions between them removed by sleep-natural or drug-induced, Vicki hadn\u0027t the experience to tell the difference. Somewhere in the mix, she thought she felt the unmistakable flavor of Celluci\u0027s life. But why can\u0027t I tell for sure? She\u0027d been so certain she\u0027d know if he was in the clinic that this sudden ambivalence was unsettling. Do I just think he\u0027s here because I want him to be here so badly? Would I have known for certain before last night\u0027s horizontal dance down memory lane with Henry? A heartbeat later, she found an answer she could live with. Christ, Vicki, don\u0027t be such a god?damned idiot. The lingering despair-despair with very little hope in it, she noted, in spite of the name of the clinic- made it difficult to get a clear fix on anyone\u0027s life. Since that also included Henry\u0027s life, she supposed she just had to take the bad with the good. The only nonsleeper glared a question at them from behind the glass walls of the nurse\u0027s station. \"I was right,\" Henry murmured. \"We\u0027ve been noticed.\" \"Good,\" Vicki declared a little too emphatically. Unable to blush, she winced. Ever since she could remember, women in nurses\u0027 uniforms had made her feel inadequate. Maybe because they seemed so com?petent. Maybe it was all that white. She had no idea. Feeling less like an all-powerful creature of the night and more like she was somewhere she shouldn\u0027t be, she skirted the lounge and stepped into the dimly lit office. \"Yes? Can I help you?\" While civil enough, the nurse\u0027s tone clearly indicated that the only help she intended to give them involved showing them the exit. \"I\u0027m looking for a friend.\" \"This is a private treatment center, not the local emergency ward. You won\u0027t find your friend here.\" \"He would have been admitted this afternoon.\" \"There was no one admitted this afternoon.\" \"Would you like me to do this?\" Henry asked qui?etly, not entirely able to keep the amusement from his voice. He\u0027d seen Vicki face demons, werewolves, mummies, and a multitude of murderous mortals with more elan. She growled a wordless reply, caught the night nurse\u0027s gaze, and held it, overcoming old programming for pride\u0027s sake. \"Are you alone here?\" Dilated pupils reflecting a faint silver gleam below an annoyed frown, the other woman shook her head. \"There\u0027s an orderly.\" \"Where is he?\" \"Asleep on a cot in the staff room.\" \"Why is he here?\" \"He stays sometimes, in case there\u0027s trouble.\" \"Trouble with what?\" Vicki rested her hands on the desk and leaned forward. \"Trouble with the donors of purchased body parts?\" The night nurse stood, still held in the silvered depths of Vicki\u0027s eyes, and mirrored her movement. She was almost as tall. \"I don\u0027t know what the hell you\u0027re talking about.\" This was not the usual response. Somewhat taken aback, Vicki allowed a little more of the Hunter off the leash, dropped a little more of her mortal camou?flage. \"You\u0027ve never noticed anything strange going on? Patients who don\u0027t quite match their records? Locked doors?\" Breathing heavily, the nurse shook her head. \"Whatever you are, you don\u0027t scare me. You want to know what scares me? Having two teenage kids and a husband who\u0027s been out of work for six months and losing this job, that scares me. I\u0027m not telling you anything.\" \"If you\u0027re dead,\" Vicki snarled, patience exhausted, \"you won\u0027t be working.\" \"You might be death for some people, I can see ...\" Fear finally showed, trapping her voice in her throat. She swallowed hard and continued. \". . . see that, but whatever you are, you aren\u0027t death for me.\" \"She\u0027s right,\" Henry said softly, impressed by a strength of will that refused to be blinded by terror. \"She knows you won\u0027t kill her without reason. She\u0027s called your bluff.\" Reaction split equally between irritation and embar?rassment, Vicki held her position at the desk. \"This does not make me weak,\" she warned him, fingers curling into fists. Amused, but careful not to let it show, he moved a little closer. \"I meant it as a compliment to her, not an insult to you. Perhaps you\u0027d best let me... \" \"No!\" This mortal was hers. Whether or not Henry could convince her to speak was irrelevant. Eyes nar?rowed, Vicki muttered, \"Must be a damned good job.\" \"It is ... mostly.\" Mostly. Vicki smiled. \"If I had a job with good money in these times, I guess I\u0027d be willing to ignore things that don\u0027t quite fit, too.\" \"Hey, I take care of the patients, and I do what I do very well.\" She straighted and folded her arms across the broad shelf of her breasts. \"What goes on in the back is none of my business.\" \"Of course it isn\u0027t. Forget you ever saw us.\" Lips pressed into a thin, disapproving line. \"You got that right.\" \"Mike\u0027s in here.\" A sign on the door said Electrical Room. \"Are you sure?\" Vicki ignored him, rummaging in the depths of her shoulderbag for her lock picks. \"I can feel a number of lives, Vicki; up, down, all around us. Most of them are drugged, all of them have been blended by their condition into one amorphous mass. How can you be sure one of those lives belongs to Michael Celluci?\" She dropped to her knees and inserted her two heaviest picks. \"I\u0027m a lot closer to his life than you are.\" \"And you want to find him very badly. I shouldn\u0027t be the one reminding you of this, but we don\u0027t know for certain he came out here. We don\u0027t know what the nurse thinks goes on in the back.\" \"And we won\u0027t find out unless we take a look.\" The door opened onto another short hall. One door led to the electrical room. The other led to a room like most other hospital rooms except for the cinder block walls and the small, high window. Vicki stood in the doorway, staring at the body on the bed, feeling curiously light-headed as all the pieces of her world clicked back into place. His face was bruised. Blood had dried in the corner of his mouth. The skin had split across the knuckles of his right hand. His heart beat to a rhythm not quite the rhythm she knew. He smelled of drugs and there were leather restraints holding him to the bed. She wanted to rip him free, gather him into her arms, and carry him to safety, but they were in no immediate danger so, for his sake, she\u0027d find out what they\u0027d done to him first. Slowly, deliberately, she crossed to the bed and unbuckled the restrains. Later, she\u0027d give in to the violence. Later, someone would pay. \"Mike?\" A quick inspection, hands stroking patterns on flesh as familiar as her own, determined nothing obvious had been removed. \"Mike, come on. Snap out of it.\" His pulse was strong. She traced the line of his jaw, her finger rasping against dark stubble. Henry watched from the doorway, knowing he\u0027d been forgotten, marveling at how much it hurt. Terri?torial imperatives, attacks, counterattacks, edged civil?ity, barely maintained control, all disappeared under memories of loving her. At the moment he hated Mi?chael Celluci more than he\u0027d ever hated anyone in his life. But the moment passed. Celluci would never have the ultimate intimacy that he and Vicki had shared-her life recreated in his arms, her blood to him, his blood to her. Everything after that ... He smiled, unable to stop himself. Everything after was a breaking of traditions he\u0027d held unbreakable, a slaughter-induced passion, a blood-soaked truce, and something that had a chance of becoming a reclaimed friendship in spite of the odds. He couldn\u0027t hate Celluci when he\u0027d gotten back more of Vicki than should have been possible. \"It smells like a sedative. Try and wake him.\" Vicki jerked toward the door, moving to put herself between the threat and the body on the bed. It took her a moment to realize it was Henry who\u0027d spoken and a moment after that to remember, in this instant at least, he was no threat. \"A sedative? How can you tell?\" \"Experience.\" \"I really don\u0027t want to know how you got that expe?rience, Henry.\" She turned back to Celluci, tugged off one running shoe, grabbed the softer flesh in the arch of his foot between thumb and forefinger, and pinched. His leg twitched. \"What are you doing?\" \"It\u0027s an acupressure technique. I\u0027m working a pres?sure point in his foot that\u0027ll help him shake off the drugs.\" \"How... ?\" \"I don\u0027t know how!\" she snapped. \"An old staff sergeant showed it to me. We used to use it on barbituate ODs; if it didn\u0027t work, they were probably dead. Come on, Mike. Shake it off.\" She pinched him again. This time he grunted and tried to yank his foot away. By the time his eyes fluttered open, Vicki had both hands clasped around his face. He blinked blearily up at her, then the lids began to sink and the irises to roll up. \"Michael Frances Celluci, don\u0027t you dare close your eyes while I\u0027m talking to you.\" \"Christ, Vicki... you sound like ... my grandmother.\" \"Do I?\" His lips were dry, so she moistened them with her tongue, licking the blood from the corner of his mouth. \"That wasn\u0027t ... a challenge,\" he pointed out when she pulled away. His gaze flicked past her. \"Where am... oh, shit.\" \"I wanted to make sure there were no broken bones before we moved you.\" \"Considerate.\" Then he frowned. \"We?\" He turned his head until he could see Henry, still in the doorway. \"What is this... truce?\" The two men locked eyes for an instant, then Henry said softly, \"The van disappeared with you. Someone had to drive.\" \"You could\u0027ve let her borrow... your car.\" \"I don\u0027t think so. The last time she borrowed my car, she got broadsided by a truck.\" \"Yeah... but the werewolf was... driving.\" \"Enough with the male bonding. It\u0027s a truce. Okay?\" Vicki gently pulled Mike\u0027s jaw around until he faced her again. \"And since the nice people who cut out kidneys are sure to come back, are you all right? Can we move you?\" \"No.\" \"No? No, what?\" \"No, you can\u0027t move me.\" \"What\u0027s wrong? What have they done?\" Her voice promised an eye for an eye at the very least. \"So far, only kidnapping.\" His thoughts were clearing, but his body remained weak. He tried to sit up and didn\u0027t have the energy to protest when Vicki lifted him, tucked a\u0027pillow between his shoulders and the wall, and lowered him gently back down again. \"You\u0027ve got to leave me here.\" He struggled to find the words that would convince Vicki to do as he said-never an easy proposition even at full mental strength. \"You take me out of here and we\u0027re never going to find out what\u0027s going on.\" \"Hey, we know what\u0027s going on.\" \"We don\u0027t know squat except that some people overreact when they\u0027re followed by people who turn out to be the police.\" He kept his explanation of ex?actly what had happened short and to the point- things got out of control only momentarily when Vicki realized he had no idea of where her van was. \"Look, can we worry about the van later, when we\u0027ve got a little more time?\" Vicki\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"We\u0027d have plenty of time if you\u0027d stop being such a pigheaded ...\" \"Think of it as going undercover.\" She smiled tightly. \"Think of it as going under the knife.\" \"Vicki, these might not be the people selling body parts, it might be something as simple as selling drugs. All we\u0027ve got is kidnapping and unlawful con?finement.\" \"And grand theft auto.\" Lightly touching her fin?gertips to the bruise on his cheek, she added, \"And assault.\" \"I think he could claim self-defense.\" \"Mike, you came out here originally for the same reason we did; Ronald Swanson\u0027s name cropped up one too many times to be coincidence. First we find out he\u0027s behind a private clinic that specializes in kid?ney transplant patients and then we find you strapped to a bed. That\u0027s enough for me.\" He closed his hand around her wrist as her eyes silvered. \"Stop reacting and start thinking. Suppose you break into Swanson\u0027s house and force a full con?fession, what then? You\u0027ve got nothing that\u0027ll stand up in court. If we want to find out what\u0027s actually going on, there has to be an investigation.\" \"What am I doing? Wandering aimlessly through the night?\" Eleven dead in a Richmond warehouse; but wander?ing aimlessly was a lot easier to deal with. \"Yeah, mostly. Picking this mess apart is going to take re?sources we don\u0027t have.\" \"If I get a full confession, I have resources enough to deal with Ronald Swanson.\" \"No.\" There was such finality in that single word that the silver fled from Vicki\u0027s eyes. \"What do you mean, no?\" \"If Swanson dies, if you kill him, it\u0027s more than I can ignore.\" She pulled her hand free and rubbed the band of warmth where his fingers had been. More than he could ignore. Those were the sort of words that came right before good-bye. \"But... \" \"No buts, Vicki.\" He gripped her shoulder, shaking her, willing her to listen. \"This is where I draw my line in the sand.\" One heartbeat. Two. \"I\u0027m not really happy about ultimatums, Mike.\" \"And I\u0027m not really happy about premeditated murder.\" Put like that, without either the masking rhetoric or the heat of the Hunt, neither was she. She supposed. One corner of her mouth twisted up in a wry smile as she reached out and pushed the overlong lock of hair up off his face. \"I guess every relationship means com?promises.\" A little surprised by the relief that softened his expression-What had he expected?-she laid her hand flat against his chest, reassured in turn by the steady beat of his heart. \"Now that\u0027s settled, what do you want me to do?\" \"I want you to leave me here... \" \"Forget it.\" \"Goddamn it, Vicki, would you just listen for a min?ute? The only way we\u0027ll find out what\u0027s happening is if we don\u0027t spook them. Leave me like you found me... \" He paused. \"Okay, there\u0027s no need to drug me again, but other than that ...\" When she didn\u0027t smile, he sighed and continued. \"Go home, and call the police. Tell them you\u0027d parked to check out a road map when you saw a big guy in a red T-shirt carry a body in the back door. They\u0027ll come out and they\u0027ll find ...\" \"Nothing. This is a hidden room. The night nurse doesn\u0027t even know for sure that it\u0027s here; how the hell are the police going to find you?\" \"All right, fine. Tell them you were visiting a sick friend, were getting back into your car, saw the guy in the red T-shirt with the body, stuck your head in the back door and saw this room. You took off before he could spot you and after dithering for a couple of hours decided to call the cops.\" \"Can I ask you a question?\" His eyes narrowed at her tone. \"What?\" \"You\u0027re a cop, try thinking like one. Would you believe a cock-and-bull story like that?\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter if they believe it, as long as they check it out.\" \"I think I can come up with a story they\u0027ll believe.\" Celluci snorted as Vicki turned to glare at Henry. \"That\u0027s right, you\u0027re a romance writer.\" \"Stay out of this, Henry.\" \"Let\u0027s start by remembering that you\u0027re working for me, and that I think the detective has made a very good point. If we let them know we\u0027re on to them, they\u0027ll vanish.\" \"So you\u0027re all in favor of leaving Mike in danger?\" Vicki pushed the words out through clenched teeth, shifting position slightly to better defend the man in the bed. Celluci sighed. \"Vicki, calm down. Whatever they\u0027re going to do to me, nothing\u0027s going to happen until morning.\" \"How do you know?\" \"How do you think? I overheard the bad guys talk?ing in the hall right before they drugged me.\" \"The bad guys?\" \"Big guy who brought me in... \" \"Cow eyes?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t know. The closest I\u0027ve ever been to a cow is in a burger. He was talking to a woman, but I never saw her. I\u0027m pretty sure she was the one using the needle, but he covered my face with a pillow be?fore she came into the room. They don\u0027t matter now.\" Trying to find a position where his head wasn\u0027t pound?ing, he shifted against the pillow. \"All you have to do is make sure the police get here before morning and I\u0027ll take them to where I got jumped and let them leap to the same conclusion I did.\" \"Which is?\" \"That you could bury an army out in those woods.\" His voice gentled. \"I promise nothing will happen in the time it\u0027ll take the police to get here. All you have to do is spin them enough of a story that they have to find me. I\u0027ll do the rest.\" \"Why don\u0027t we take you to the police and you can spin them the story?\" \"How did I get out of the restraints?\" She threw up her hands. \"Do I have to think of everything?\" \"But you\u0027re not thinking.\" He caught her gaze and held it, unafraid of what he\u0027d find. \"We have to set this up so that we, I, can answer the questions they\u0027re going to ask. You and Fitzroy can\u0027t become involved.\" Statements, court dates-no chance at all that the system would only want them after sunset. Vicki turned to look at Henry and saw the two men were in complete agreement. Worst of all, she had to admit to herself it made sense. To herself. Not to them. \"You\u0027ve been drugged all evening. You\u0027re in no con?dition to make plans.\" \"My body is tapioca and my head is pounding, but my cognitive processes are unimpared.\" \"Sure. And you usually talk like that.\" Sighing, she began to flick the hair on Celluci\u0027s arm in the wrong direction. \"I still don\u0027t like it.\" \"Stop that.\" His hand covered hers. \"Vicki, it\u0027s going to take you what, an hour to get back to the condo? It\u0027s June. Sunrise is at 4:14. You haven\u0027t time to do anything tonight, so, please, let the police han?dle it.\" \"The ghosts want Henry to avenge their deaths.\" \"Then let Henry make the call. It\u0027s the only way everyone involved will get what\u0027s coming to them.\" Her lips curled back off her teeth. \"If they hurt you, Mike ...\" \"You can hurt them back.\" He wouldn\u0027t have said it except that he was certain he wouldn\u0027t be hurt-her answering smile was everything he was afraid it would be. \"This is the only way to cover all the bases, Vicki. I\u0027m not asking you to be happy about it, I\u0027m saying that it\u0027s the way it\u0027s got to be. Now redo the restraints and get out of here, and it\u0027ll all be over in a couple of hours.\" \"If Swanson dies, if you kill him, it\u0027s more than I can ignore... This is where I\u0027m drawing my line in the sand.\" The words hung in the air between them. If she carried Celluci out of the clinic, he\u0027d never forgive her and that was a certainty. If she left him, and Henry sent the police in immediately, what could go wrong? In spite of the lingering scent of another woman-and for Celluci\u0027s sake she hoped it was the woman with the needle-her smile took on a different flavor as she buckled down his wrists. \"You know, this has possibilities.\" When a gentle caress up the inside of his bare arm raised goose bumps, she took the waist?band of his jeans in her teeth and tugged. \"Vicki!\" \"Michael... \" \"Fitzroy, would you please get her out of here.\" She shot him a warning glance. Henry raised a spec?ulative brow. \"As tasty as he looks, perhaps now is not the time.\" Celluci grunted as Vicki vaulted the bed, hand still on his thigh. \"Touch him and I\u0027ll rip you into pieces so small you\u0027ll be able to... \" Then she stopped, straight?ened, and frowned. \"You did that on purpose.\" \"Yes.\" In spite of their progress, it took remarkably little to evoke a territorial response. He looked past her to Celluci struggling against the restraints and al?lowed that that particular response could have been evoked almost as easily before she changed. \"Don\u0027t worry, Detective. I have no desire to feed at this time. Say good-bye, Vicki, and let\u0027s go.\" Muttering under her breath, Vicki turned back to the bed and Michael Celluci. She bent to kiss him and paused just above his lips where she could taste his breath. \"I\u0027m not sure I can just walk out and leave you here.\" \"Bullshit. You can do anything.\" \"Don\u0027t patronize me, Celluci.\" \"Then stop being such a tragedy queen. I\u0027ll be fine until the police arrive.\" His mouth moved under hers. \"Now go.\" \"We should go out the front. The back door\u0027s prob?ably hooked to an alarm.\" \"I don\u0027t see anything.\" Vicki quickly ran a finger around the door edge. \"And I don\u0027t feel a wire. Look, the car\u0027s right outside in the parking lot. Let\u0027s just do what Mike said and go.\" She pressed down on the bar and pushed. The ambient noise of the clinic remained unchanged. \"See, no alarm. These are sick people in here, probably don\u0027t want to terrify them with loud noises. Come on, old man, I\u0027ll race you to the car.\" As Henry had observed, it took very little to evoke a territorial response. Once she started running, he had to chase after her. Moving too fast for mortal eyes to follow, they reached the car before the door slammed. He was awake instantly, on his feet the instant after, unsure of what he\u0027d heard but sure he\u0027d heard some?thing. If he\u0027d learned anything in prison, he\u0027d learned to sleep lightly. The muffled sound of car doors closing brought him to the window of the staff room where, tucked to one side, invisible from the parking lot, he watched a BMW reverse and pull away. The two peo?ple in it seemed to be fighting. He didn\u0027t recognize either silhouette. Probably kids looking for a quiet spot to mess around in. He yawned, thought about going back to sleep, thought about what the doc would say if any?thing went wrong, and decided it wouldn\u0027t hurt to look in on their uninvited guest. The access door to the electrical room was un?locked. He knew he\u0027d locked it. Crepe-soled shoes silent against the tile, he entered the hidden room, half expecting an empty bed. The big cop was still tied down and out cold. He flicked on the light, hand raised to shield his eyes from the sudden fluorescent glare. The body on the bed didn\u0027t so much as twitch. A closer inspection seemed to indi?cate that nothing had changed. But something had. Hadn\u0027t there been a hunk of hair in the cop\u0027s face? No way he could brush it back tied down like he was. He tested the restraints with his finger. The left wrist was in the fourth hole, the right in the third. He usually did them up equally but, even half stunned, the cop had been fighting him and maybe... The cop shifted slightly, muttering a little. That was good. The sedative should be wearing off and a more natural sleep taking over. They used sedatives a lot in the prison hospital as it was easier than actually treat?ing the patients and in his practiced opinion, the cop\u0027s chest now rose and fell in an unsedated rhythm. He frowned. Just over the left hip, there was a dark half circle on the pale blue denim. It looked moist, like... He touched it. It was almost dry but it looked like someone had been chewing on the cop\u0027s jeans. He closed his thumb and forefinger over the spot and tugged. \"I don\u0027t wanna know what was going on in here,\" he said. The skin on the back of his neck prickled as he felt the weight of the cop\u0027s stare. When he turned his head, narrowed eyes were glaring up at him. \"You got kinky friends, cop. Wanna tell me why they left you?\" \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" \"Sure you don\u0027t.\" Unable to avoid it, Celluci rolled with the back?handed slap. \"Fuck you,\" he growled. \"Maybe.\" The closest phone was in the staff room. \"We\u0027ll see what the doc has to say.\" \"Where are we going?\" Vicki spat the question through gritted teeth. Henry was driving again because he\u0027d refused to give her the keys, had put on his Prince-of-Man face and said \"No\" in a tone that sug?gested arguing would be a waste of time. She\u0027d gotten back in the car for Celluci\u0027s sake and had continually regretted it. In a minute, Henry was going to regret it, too. \"The condo is that way.\" \"There\u0027s a coffee shop on the corner up here, and we need to talk to a police officer.\" \"Christ, Henry, this is Vancouver, there\u0027s a coffee shop on every corner.\" She reached for the wheel. When Henry maintained his grip, the resulting tus?sle was short; Vicki having spent thirty-two years mor?tal had no illusions about surviving the results of a moving car gone out of control. Besides, the seat belts got in the way of her attack. \"Unlike most, this coffee shop has parking,\" Henry told her when she was back in the passenger seat, glaring out the window. \"Somewhere for them to put the cruiser.\" And there was, in fact, a cruiser in the parking lot. \"Go ahead, reinforce stereotypes,\" Vicki muttered as Henry parked the car and turned off the engine. \"Now what?\" \"Now I go and have a word with the two constables, interrupting their break with a story of a body glimpsed from the side of the highway.\" She got out of the car when he did, grateful for the chance to untangle her personal space from his. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re actually going along with this. Hell, I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m actually going along with this. We left him back there, Henry.\" With the car a barrier between them, she allowed a little\u0027of the anger to slip from her grip-although who exactly she was angry with, she couldn\u0027t say. \"We walked out on him. Left him helpless and alone.\" \"It\u0027s a minimal risk, Vicki, and a risk he\u0027s willing to take in order to finish this once and for all. The police will be there within the hour. What could possi?bly go wrong?\" \"Famous last words.\" The night smelled of car ex?haust and heated metal, less strongly here on the Coast than in Toronto but still too many people crammed into too small a space. Vicki turned back toward the clinic and tried not to think how things that could go wrong usually did. \"I left him there be?cause he asked me to,\" she said softly, silvered gaze locked on Henry once again. \"I\u0027m doing it for Mike, but you\u0027ve never cared what he thinks of you.\" Haven\u0027t I? Michael Celluci is an honorable man and the opinions of honorable men are sometimes all we have to define ourselves by. But there was little point in sparking another territorial dispute over Celluci\u0027s affections even though her previous reaction had more amused than infuriated him. \"I\u0027m no vigilante, Vicki, no matter how it may have seemed in the past. If I can be responsible for a solution within the parameters of the law, then everyone should be happy.\" \"A solution within the parameters of the law?\" she repeated. Shaking her head, she folded her arms on the roof of the car and rested her chin on their pillow. \"Go ahead. And make it good.\" Henry had no doubt he could spin a story that the police would believe, add enough detail that they not only had to check it out but also found everything they needed to. There was, however, no need to tax his imagination. When it came right down to it, it wasn\u0027t what he said but how he said it that mattered. \"Excuse me, Officers, may I have a word?\" Resisting the completely inexplicable urge to come to attention, the police constable in the driver\u0027s seat put down his coffee and snapped out an efficient, \"Yes, sir.\" When the constable in the passenger seat, wonder?ing what the hell was going on with her partner, leaned past him for a better look, she found herself reacting much the same way. The bastard son of Henry VIII, Duke of Richmond and Somerset, inclined his head in recognition of their deference. \"I have some information you might find worthy of investigation.\" His father would have ap?proved of the tone. Tony woke up as Henry came into the condo, sat up on the couch, and rubbed his eyes. \"Did you find him?\" \"Yes.\" \"That must\u0027ve made Victory happy.\" \"Not exactly.\" \"Oh, man. Henry, you didn\u0027t kill her before you got to the clinic?\" \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" \"And don\u0027t try that more-princely-than-thou crap on me either. I\u0027m not in the mood. If you didn\u0027t kill Vicki before you got to the clinic and if you found Celluci, why isn\u0027t she happy?\" \"Because we left him there.\" \"You what?\" \"It was his idea. He thought if we rescued him, it would alert the people behind this whole organ-legging thing that we\u0027re on to them. He told us to inform the police and let them handle it while the evidence is still out in plain view.\" \"Yeah, but unless he\u0027s missing a kidney, how are they going to connect him with the body in the harbor?\" \"Celluci seems to think he knows where the bodies are buried.\" \"And Victory just let him stay?\" \"Not exactly. He had to appeal to her better nature.\" Tony snorted. \"I didn\u0027t know she had one where he was concerned. Did you tell the police?\" \"I did, and with luck that\u0027ll be enough to satisfy my visitors.\" Henry glanced down at his watch. \"Why aren\u0027t you in bed? Don\u0027t you have to work tomorrow?\" \"I wanted to know if Celluci was safe before I went back to Gerry\u0027s and John\u0027s.\" He scrambled to his feet, folded the blanket haphazardly, and stood staring at the floor. Henry sighed, wondering when exactly things had gotten so awkward between them. \"Tony, it\u0027s late. The sun will be up in a few short moments. Why don\u0027t you stay here in your own room?\" \"I don\u0027t... \" \"I know.\" Tony\u0027s head came up, drawn by the understanding in Henry\u0027s voice. \"When this is over, as it easily could be by tomor?row evening, we have to talk, but for right now there\u0027s no reason for you to leave.\" \"I guess not.\" He glanced over at the clock on the VCR, and his eyes widened. \"Henry, sunrise is in less than five minutes.\" \"I\u0027m aware of that.\" Starting down the hall, Henry motioned Tony into step beside him. \"Can you keep an eye on the news tomorrow-maybe tape the morn?ing broadcast before you go. I\u0027m sure Detective Celluci will keep Vicki and me out of range when it hits the fan, but I\u0027d feel better if I knew for certain.\" \"No sweat. I\u0027ll set it up to tape the news at noon and the six o\u0027clock report, too.\" \"That won\u0027t interfere with it taping Batman, will it?\" Tony grinned. It was the nonvampire, nonprince parts of Henry that had kept them together for so long. \"Chill. You\u0027ll get your cartoon.\" They were at the door, Henry\u0027s hand was on the knob, in another moment he\u0027d lock himself away until sunset. Tony suddenly wanted to prolong that moment. \"You, uh, got a question for the ghosts? One that\u0027ll cover both of them?\" \"Vicki suggests I ask if they were killed by the same person.\" \"You figure she knows what she\u0027s talking about?\" \"It is why I asked her to come here, but, hopefully, it won\u0027t be a problem. Hopefully, they\u0027ll be resting in peace by sunset.\" He opened the door, reached out, and stroked Tony\u0027s cheek with two fingers. All he could think of to say was \"good-bye,\" but he didn\u0027t want to say that yet, so he said nothing at all. \"I can\u0027t stand it. This bedroom exudes pink even in full dark.\" Vicki punched the pillow into another shape and threw herself back down, fully aware that the bedroom had nothing to do with her mood and equally aware that she had nothing else to take it out on. The ride back to the condo had been easier than the ride to Project Hope. The more time she and Henry spent together, the more they forced the truce to endure, the easier it got. But she still wanted to kill something. Not Henry. Mike. \"It was a mistake leaving him there. I know it. I just know it. After all these years,\" she asked the night as it fled, \"why have I suddenly decided to start lis?tening to ...\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-debt-vicki-nelson-5/page-10.html","bookId":2468,"book":{"id":2468,"title":"Blood Debt (Vicki Nelson #5)","description":"Storyline: Blood Debt (Vicki Nelson #5) The book revolves around three main characters, Vicki Nelson, a Private Investigator and ex-cop, her lover, homicide detective Mike Celluci, and her ex-lover Henry Fitzroy, 450-year-old vampire, romance writer, and bastard son of Henry VIII.
