{"id":82058,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\"KEEP your ears open ...\"\n Tony stuffed another cartridge in the rewinder with more emphasis than was absolutely necessary. So far he\u0027d overheard a totally unbelievable excuse about a destroyed tape, a conversation that could be used to script a bad made-for-TV movie, and three long-winded reviews from a retired office machinery sales?man who expressed opinions on his weekend rentals every Monday. Not exactly the buzz on the street.\n \"Vicki says you\u0027re the best...\"\n \"Yeah, right,\" he muttered, staring out the window. While he wasn\u0027t stupid enough to wish himself back into cold and hunger and fear, he couldn\u0027t help feeling cut off from the one thing he did well.\n On the other side of Robeson, two teenagers leaned against a bank building soaking up the sun. One was thin and black. The other, thin and white. Skin color their only visible difference. They both wore filthy army pants, old scuffed Doc Martens, and sleeveless black T-shirts-one faced with a red peace symbol, the other with an ivory skull. Steel rings glinted in both noses above moving mouths.\n Eyes narrowed in irritation-lipreading was not as easy as it looked on TV-Tony started to ad-lib the words he couldn\u0027t hear. \"You know about that gang selling organs? Yeah, man, like I\u0027m droppin\u0027 off a kid?ney tomorrow.\"\n \"What the hell are you talkin\u0027 about, Foster?\"\n Tony jumped and whirled to face his boss who\u0027d returned, unnoticed, from the store room. Squelching the lingering instinctive street response to growl, \"None of your business,\" he muttered. \"Nothing.\"\n The older man shook his head and handed him a pile of boxes to reshelve. \"I\u0027ve said it before, and I\u0027ll say it again; you\u0027re a weird one. Get back to work.\"\n \"Vicki says you\u0027re the best...\"\n It wasn\u0027t so much that he was letting Vicki down, more that he\u0027d lost a part of himself.\n Scooping up the boxes, he came around the end of the counter just as one of the teenagers across the street held out his hand to the other. It was such an unusual gesture that it caught his attention and he stopped for a moment to watch. They shook hands formally, uncomfortably, then moved apart. As one of them turned to face the store, the ivory skull smiled.\n Tony rubbed at his eyes with his free hand and looked again. It was a T-shirt, old and faded and noth?ing more.\n Of course the skull was smiling, you idiot. Skulls always smile. Tony Foster, you have been hanging around with vampires too long. But a line of sweat dribbled icy cold down the center of his back, and the hand that set the video boxes on the shelves was shaking.\n \"You got my money?\"\n The driver\u0027s smile was so nonthreatening it was al?most inane. \"It\u0027s in the bag.\"\n The bag had been printed with a cheap rip-off of the Vancouver Grizzlies logo. There were at least a million of them around the city. After a brief struggle with a zipper that seemed intent on snagging, it opened to show several packets of worn tens and twenties.\n \"All right!\" Considering how many dreams it held, the bag weighed next to nothing as it lifted off the floor. \"Hey? What the fuck are you grinning about?\"\n The driver\u0027s smile broadened as he guided the dark sedan onto the Lion\u0027s Gate Bridge heading for North Vancouver. \"I\u0027m just happy when someone gets off the streets.\"\n Thin arms tightened around the bag. \"Yeah, like you\u0027re a real fucking Good Samaritan.\" He scowled at the dashboard. \"Hey, weren\u0027t you in a gray car before?\"\n \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m using my own car for this, do you?\" The tone was mocking, superior.\n \"No. Guess not.\"\n They drove in silence along the North Shore, the only sound the quiet hum of the air-conditioner fan. When the car turned off Mt. Seymour Parkway onto Mt. Seymour Road, the teenager in the passenger seat shifted nervously. \"Shouldn\u0027t I be like blindfolded or something?\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"So I can\u0027t, you know, tell anyone about this.\"\n \"Tell who?\" the driver asked quietly.\n \"No one, man. Fuck... \" Contrary to romantic belief, those who lived on the street actually learned very little about life. The one and only lesson the sur?vivors learned was how to survive. If they failed to learn it, then by definition they were just another sad statistic. The boy in the car figured himself for a survi?vor. He knew a threat when he heard one. There was suddenly more to the gorilla behind the wheel than those big, friendly, doggy eyes.\n Palms leaving damp prints on the cheap nylon bag, he stared unfocused through the tinted windshield and built a pleasant fantasy of beating the driver\u0027s smug, self-satisfied face in. His eyes widened a little as they passed a security gate and turned onto a private road. They widened further as the clinic came into view.\n \"This don\u0027t look like no hospital.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\" A sign by the edge of the drive read Staff Only. \"Our clients don\u0027t like to think they\u0027re in a hospital, and they pay big bucks to maintain the illusion they aren\u0027t.\"\n \"Fuck, what kind of clients you got?\"\n The driver smiled. \"Rich ones.\"\n Rich ones. His right hand patted the rectangular bulges stretching the side of the bag. Rich ones like him.\n Standard police procedure maintained that a per?sonal visit elicited more information than a phone call. Not only were facial expressions harder to fake, but the minutiae of surrounding environmental clues were often invaluable. As Mike Celluci pushed open the door leading to the offices of the British Columbia Transplant Society, he recognized that no aspect of this \"case\" resembled standard police procedure, but when it came right down to it, he didn\u0027t have anything else to do.\n \"Can I help you?\" The woman behind the reception desk at the BC Transplant Society fixed him with the steely-eyed, no-nonsense gaze of the professional vol?unteer. Celluci felt as though he were being assessed for potential usefulness and could almost hear her thinking: How nice, muscle. I\u0027m sure we have some?thing around that needs moving.\n \"Is Ronald Swanson in?\"\n Her eyes narrowed. \"Is this about that dreadful woman?\"\n \"If you mean the cable interview... ?\"\n \"Look, you\u0027re the fourteenth person who\u0027s asked about it since I came in-although the other thirteen were satisfied with a phone call.\" Two spots of color blazed through the powder on her cheeks. \"I\u0027ll tell you the same thing I told them; there is absolutely no truth to anything Patricia Chou said, and she should be prosecuted for spreading such a horrible, horrible story. Donated organs go to the most needy person on the list. They are not ever sold to the highest bid?der. Ever.\"\n Somewhat taken aback, Celluci spread his hands and arranged his features into his best information eliciting expression. \"Not within the system, no, but if someone were to circumvent ...\"\n \"That doesn\u0027t happen.\"\n \"But it could.\"\n \"I believe Mr. Swanson made it perfectly clear that such a horrific concept is impossible.\"\n \"No, ma\u0027am. He merely said it would be difficult and expensive. Which is why I wanted to speak with him.\" He\u0027d been half tempted to wander into one of the rougher sections of the city and see if he could find some gang action, but upon reflection decided he\u0027d rather live a little longer. While he had no doubt he\u0027d survive the gangs, Vicki\u0027d kill him for taking the risk.\n Her nostrils pinched shut, the receptionist laid both hands on the desk and leaned forward. \"We are ex?tremely fortunate that a man of Mr. Swanson\u0027s wealth and social standing is willing to do so much work for the society, but given the demands on his time, he does not spend his days here. If you want to speak with him, you\u0027ll have to call his office. You\u0027ll find Swanson Realty in the Yellow Pages.\"\n It was as efficient a dismissal as if she\u0027d hung up on him. Thanking her for her time, Celluci turned and left the office.\n I pity the fifteenth caller, he thought as he waited for the elevator.\n Swanson Realty actually was in the book, and from the size of the accompanying ad, Ronald Swanson was indeed doing very well for himself. Unfortunately, there was no way a company that size would put through a call to the owner unless the caller identified himself as a homicide detective. Too bad he was just a guy on vacation.\n Frowning, Celluci let the phone book fall back into its plastic case and left the booth. For the first time, he had a good idea of how Vicki\u0027d felt when her dete?riorating eyesight pushed her off the force. He didn\u0027t much like the feeling.\n Fortunately, it wasn\u0027t important he speak to Ronald Swanson. He\u0027d mostly wanted the meeting for his own peace of mind. Since the man had obviously given some thought to the impossibility of setting up an organ-legging operation, Celluci\u0027d hoped he could get him to expand on his reasoning.\n Patricia Chou had almost convinced him Vicki was right about the organ-legging, and that meant-Ms. Chou\u0027s personal vendetta aside-Swanson was as much a suspect as the faceless crime lords of Vancouver.\n But one body, one kidney, wasn\u0027t going to generate much in the way of profit.\n So, somewhere, there had to be more bodies.\n Or there were going to be more bodies.\n He didn\u0027t much like either option.\n The room was small with a single window up near the ceiling. The bottom four feet of the walls were a soft pink and so was the blanket on the bed. He guessed it was supposed to be soothing, but it made him think of Pepto Bismol and he didn\u0027t much like it.\n He didn\u0027t much like the pajamas either, but the driver had made it perfectly clear he was expected to shower, then put them on.\n At least the son of a bitch hadn\u0027t stayed to watch.\n He locked the bathroom door behind him before even unlacing his boots and got in and out of the shower as fast as he could, unable to cope with an extended vulnerability. Unfortunately, the pajamas left him feeling little safer.\n At least they don\u0027t have a hole in the front for my dick to fall out of.\n Bag of money clutched tight against his side, he tried the exit. Locked. But he\u0027d expected that. They wouldn\u0027t want him roaming around bothering their rich patients.\n When the handle began to turn under his fingers, he hurriedly released it and backed toward the bed, heart pounding. He relaxed only slightly when the fa?miliar form of the doctor entered the room pushing a stainless steel cart.\n \"Good afternoon, Doug. Are you comfortable?\"\n \" \u0027S okay. What\u0027s that for?\" He eyed the equipment laid out on the top shelf suspiciously.\n \"Donor specific blood transfusions enhance graft survival. So... \" She ripped open a cotton swab with brutal efficiency. \"... I\u0027m going to need to take some blood.\"\n Later, when it was over and he was lying in bed feeling weak and dizzy, his fingers plucked at the bag searching for reassurance. It wouldn\u0027t be so bad, he thought, refusing to acknowledge the fear that closed his throat and lay cold and clammy against his skin, if I could only see out the window....\n Jerked out of sleep, Celluci scrambled across the king-sized bed toward the ringing phone. The clock beside it said 7:04 P.M. Forty minutes to sunset. He\u0027d lain down at three for a half-hour nap but was obvi?ously more tired than he thought. The dainty, ladylike receiver almost disappeared in his hand, but eventu?ally he got the right end to his ear. A quick glance at the call display showed him a familiar number. \"What\u0027ve you got for me, Dave?\"\n On the other end of the line, his partner, Detective-Sergeant Dave Graham, sighed deeply. \"I\u0027m fine, Mike. How are you? I got the names and addresses you wanted.\"\n \"Thanks. How come you\u0027re calling from home?\"\n \"Maybe I was on my way out of the office when you called. Maybe pulling these things off the system took a little time and I wanted to spend what was left of the evening with my family. Maybe I thought you didn\u0027t want the whole office wondering why you were suddenly interested in Vancouver gangs and real es?tate salesmen. You choose.\"\n Celluci grinned. \"What were those options again?\"\n \"Fuck you, too, buddy. Got a pencil handy?\"\n \"Hang on.\" He hit the hold button and headed into the kitchen where he\u0027d seen a pad and a jar of pens beside an extremely expensive replica of an old-fash?ioned wall phone. \"Okay. Go ahead.\"\n \"You\u0027ll notice I\u0027m not asking why you want these things.\"\n \"And I appreciate that, Dave.\"\n \"I mean, I\u0027m willing to believe that you\u0027re just mak?ing some exciting vacation plans and are not being drawn into one of Vicki\u0027s weirdo, made for Fox TV investigations.\u0027\u0027\n \"Thanks, Dave.\"\n \"Yeah, well, I\u0027m gullible that way. Try not to get yourself killed.\"\n The first half of the list, from the firmly entrenched to the up-and-coming, was longer than he\u0027d thought it would be. There was nothing about Ronald Swanson at all. The man didn\u0027t have so much as an outstanding parking ticket.\n Henry woke angry, but that was to be expected as Vicki\u0027s scent-the scent of an intruder, a competing predator-still clung to the bedroom. He\u0027d been lying with his upper lip half lifted in a snarl, and it took him a moment to peel the flesh off air-dried teeth.\n \"I bet Brad Pitt never has this problem,\" he mut?tered, reaching for the light.\n The handless ghost waited impatiently at the end of the bed. The body in the morgue had been less disturbing-it was only dead. This spirit had moved beyond death, and shadows clung to it. Eldritch shad?ows, Henry found himself thinking and shook his head to dislodge the thought. Oh, that\u0027s just what I need-now I\u0027m channeling adjectives from H.P. Lovecraft.\n The ghost began to lift its mutilated arms, but be?fore it could open its mouth to scream, Henry snarled, \"That was you at the morgue, wasn\u0027t it?\"\n Arms still uplifted, its expression bordered on petu?lance as it disappeared.\n Alone again, Henry swung his legs out of bed, then, as they touched the carpet, he paused. The lingering scent of a second vampire had been acknowledged if not dealt with. The ghost had been banished for one more sunset. And yet, an uneasiness remained. There was something more.\n Or more precisely, something less.\n Tony.\n Although he could hear the throbbing heartbeat of the surrounding city, no bloodsong called from within the limits of his sanctuary. With so many other things there, Tony\u0027s absence stood out in sharp relief.\n Henry stared at his reflection and realized it felt surprisingly good to be alone.\n \"What\u0027re you looking so excited about?\"\n \"Me? Nothing.\"\n With the denial the gleam of antici?pation in Vicki\u0027s eyes switched off.\n Celluci frowned. The things she thought she had to hide from him were never good-in fact, most of the time they were very not good. He watched her care?fully as she crossed the living room, pulled out a slat-backed chair, and straddled it but could see nothing that might give him any explanations. \"That chair\u0027s a Stickley,\" he grunted as she tipped it forward on two legs and reached across the table for his notes. \"Try not to break it.\"\n \"Chill, Michael. I don\u0027t know why you think you can\u0027t trust me with expensive furniture. What\u0027ve you got?\"\n He pushed a sheet of paper toward her groping fin?gers. \"The reasons Ms. Chou thinks the missing kid?ney is our motive.\"\n Vicki scanned the familiar handwriting. \"She\u0027s pretty convincing.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know you needed convincing.\" Before she could answer, he handed her another page. \"The rea?sons Mr. Ronald Swanson thinks it\u0027s impractical.\"\n \"You spoke to him?\"\n \"No. It\u0027s what I remembered from the cable program.\"\n \"If Swanson works for the transplant programs, it\u0027s in his best interest to squash this kind of speculation, so his is not exactly an unbiased opinion.\"\n \"It\u0027s in Ms. Chou\u0027s best interest to promote scandal. Not exactly an unbiased opinion either.\"\n \"But it\u0027s the only possible motive we\u0027ve got and so should be investigated.\"\n \"What about a simple gangland killing, take the hands to use later?\"\n \"And leave the kidney out of it?\" She flashed him a serene and totally false smile as she picked up a pencil and a blank piece of paper. \"We have what; a dead body missing both hands and a kidney. We have where; thanks to Henry\u0027s ghost\u0027s wardrobe which indi-cates he\u0027s local. We have why... \"\n \"We have a potential why,\" Celluci broke in.\n \"Fine. A potential why; missing kidney equals or?gans for profit. So... \" Flicking the pencil into the air, she watched it rise toward the ceiling, then caught it as it tumbled down. \"Next on the list, who. Our only clue is the missing hands, missing hands often mean gangs who are always looking for new profit and who can certainly find and finance crooked hackers, crooked doctors, and loyal thugs.\" The gleam of anticipation had returned. \"I think that takes care of your Mr. Swanson\u0027s objections.\"\n \"And what about Mr. Swanson himself?\"\n \"Why is Mr. Swanson chopping off the hands?\"\n \"I hate it when you answer a question with a ques?tion,\" Celluci growled.\n \"I know. There\u0027re two reasons I can think of for the killer to remove the hands. One, the prints are on record, and dumping the hands will hide the identity- a belief which shows an appalling lack of knowledge of modern police forensics. If that body had a record, he\u0027d have been identified by now. Or, two, the prints aren\u0027t on record and are useful because of that. Which brings us back to the gangs. We can have this sucker solved by morning.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"I find out who\u0027s running the top gangs in this fair city.\" Her teeth showed, too long and too white. \"And I ask them a few questions. The boss men always know what the other gangs are up to-that\u0027s how they stay the boss.\"\n Celluci had a sudden vision of a great deal of blood spilled over very expensive suits. \"How are you going to find out who the top men are?\"\n \"I\u0027ll ask a few questions farther down the ladder.\"\n There were certain aspects of Vicki\u0027s new nature he found so difficult to understand that he didn\u0027t ever bother making the attempt. This wasn\u0027t one of them. \"You\u0027re looking forward to this, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"And why shouldn\u0027t I be?\" Her tone was as much defensive as challenging. \"You have no idea of how hard it is to always hold back. To be less than you\u0027re capable of being!\"\n \"What? Less violent?\" He leaned toward her, fore?arms flat on the table, biceps straining against the fab?ric of his golf shirt. \"I hate to burst your bubble, Vicki, but we\u0027ve all got to live with that. It\u0027s the price we pay for civilization.\"\n \"Give it up, Celluci.\" She leaned forward as well. \"You can stop being so god-damned holier than fuck?ing thou! You can\u0027t possibly feel sorry for the type of lowlife I\u0027m going to be... \" As his eyes narrowed, she paused for a heartbeat. \"... dealing with. What\u0027s that?\" She stared suspiciously at the list he held out to her.\n \"It\u0027s an easier way. I had Dave pull the names and addresses of the people you want off the computer.\"\n \"Oh.\" The paper drooped between thumb and forefinger.\n If he\u0027d been willing to risk pandering to her desire for mayhem, he\u0027d have reminded her that she still had to get to those people through what would no doubt be tight security. As he neither wanted to remind her of her potential for violence nor himself of her poten?tial danger, he said neutrally. \"There\u0027re a lot of names for one night. Why don\u0027t you split them with Henry?\"\n \"Henry?\" Her eyes silvered. \"No. No Henry. This is my hunt! Mine!\"\n \"As much as I hate to say this, he\u0027s not totally in?competent. He\u0027s even done this kind of stuff for you before.\"\n \"Before,\" Vicki reminded him, the last syllable more growl than spoken word.\n Celluci stared at her for a few seconds then sat back, shaking his head. \"So he was right.\"\n \"About what?\"\n \"About your childish inability to work with him.\" In spite of her sometimes tenuous control of what she\u0027d become, Celluci\u0027d always believed that Vicki would never hurt him. He\u0027d wondered occasionally, as he prodded at the limits of her new nature, if he deliber?ately put that belief to the test. He wondered it now as she slowly stood. She seemed taller than he knew she was. The hair on his arms lifted, and he felt his chin begin to rise, an instinctive surrender bypassing his conscious control. He forced it back down.\n Eyes blazing, Vicki stepped forward, closed her hands around the chair she had been sitting in, and ripped it into kindling, one handful of wood at a time. A moment later, breathing heavily-not from the de?struction but from the effort of regaining control-she snarled, \"See what you made me do!\"\n \"I made you do?\" His heart beat so loudly even he could hear it. Considering how well attuned she was to that sort of sound, he was a little surprised she could hear his voice over it. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"No.\" Her eyes were almost gray again. The silver remaining could have been a trick of the light. \"I guess not.\" She reached across the table and brushed the curl of hair back off his face. \"But you\u0027ve got no right accusing me of living dangerously.\"\n \"No. I guess not.\" Capturing her hand, he laid his lips against the cool skin of her inner wrist, a mirror image of a position they\u0027d held a hundred times. \"Now what?\"\n \"Now, I\u0027m going to call Henry.\"\n \"Call?\"\n \"Yeah. On the telephone.\" She pulled free of his grip and patted him lightly on both cheeks. \"You\u0027re not the only one who can think of an easier way to get through this, sweet knees.\"\n He frowned as she walked away. \"Sweet knees?\"\n \"... suppose one of them turns out to be the man we\u0027re looking for?\" Henry asked as he folded the list and slipped it into his pocket. He\u0027d tried to sound neither sarcastic nor superior and had been, all things considered, remarkably successful at both. But then, they\u0027d always been able to manage over the phone.\n \"What? You mean suppose one of your... subjects says: Yeah, I\u0027m the guy. I\u0027ve been selling organs all up and down the West Coast. Usually we dump \u0027em at sea, but that body in the harbor must have got caught in the tides?\"\n With an effort, he kept his smile from showing in his voice-Vicki had sounded so incredibly indignant at the mere possibility he might discover the informa?tion before she did. \"Yes. Suppose one of my... subjects says that. If you\u0027ve given me half the list, the odds are fifty-fifty.\"\n \"You don\u0027t need to tell me the odds, Henry. I may be a childish vampire ...\"\n He heard Celluci protest in the background and was quite happy to have missed the earlier argument.\n \"... but I have been doing this living thing a lot longer than you did, and I\u0027ve certainly been an investi?gator one hell of a lot longer.\"\n \"I hadn\u0027t intended to suggest you hadn\u0027t.\"\n \"Oh, no, you just intended to suggest you didn\u0027t need me here at all.\"\n Frowning slightly, he went back over the conversa?tion and tried to determine how she\u0027d arrived at that particular conclusion. \"Vicki, I may be able to strong-arm crime lords, but it would never have occurred to me to do it.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"If I\u0027m going to get rid of my nonblithe spirit, I do need you here.\"\n \"Oh.\" He heard her sigh. \"I can\u0027t decide whether you\u0027re being mature or patronizing.\"\n \"Which would you prefer?\"\n \"You know, that\u0027s a very Celluci question. I don\u0027t want you guys hanging around together any more.\" But he could hear the sound of her smile, so it was all right.\n \"I fully understand.\"\n She snorted, a purely human sound. \"You couldn\u0027t possibly. Whoever gets back first leaves a message on the other\u0027s machine.\"\n \"You don\u0027t think we should meet?\" He had an un?expected memory of the pulse that beat at the base of her throat, her skin the soft, sun-kissed tan it would never be again and missed her reply in the sudden surge of loneliness. \"I\u0027m sorry, I ...\"\n Her voice was as gentle as he\u0027d heard it since the change. \"I\u0027m sorry, too, Henry.\"\n \"Everything all worked out?\"\n Her hand still resting on the phone, Vicki turned to face Celluci and shrugged. \"I gave Henry every other name. He knows what we need to find out. Like you said, he\u0027s not totally incompetent.\"\n Celluci\u0027s brows drew in at the hint of melancholy in her voice. \"And the phone thing went okay?\"\n \"No reason why it shouldn\u0027t, is there? Across the country, across the hall, it\u0027s basically the same thing.\"\n You miss him, don\u0027t you? But that was one question he wasn\u0027t stupid enough to ask. She didn\u0027t miss Fitz?roy-the undead royal bastard was still around-she missed what they\u0027d had, and he didn\u0027t want to remind her of that because she could never, ever have it again, and while he reveled in the certainty, he had no inten?tion of coming across as an insensitive prick.\n \"Need to feed?\" he asked instead.\n Melancholy gone, she grinned and her eyes frosted. \"No, thanks, I\u0027m dining out.\"\n \"Yeah. Right.\" Actually, he found the thought of her gorging on the blood of Vancouver\u0027s crime lords less problematic than her gentler meals. Those were the nights he didn\u0027t want to think about. Standing sud?denly, he joined her on the way to the door. \"Hang on and I\u0027ll go with you as far as the lobby. Tony\u0027s working till nine. I think I\u0027ll head over to the video store and see if he wants to join me for a bite.\" When both her brows rose, he sighed. \"You know, eating never used to come with this many double entendres.\"\n She\u0027d half turned to answer him as he closed the door. By the time they became aware they weren\u0027t alone in the hall, it was too late to do anything that wouldn\u0027t seem like a retreat.\n \"Henry.\"\n \"Vicki.\"\n Oh, shit. Still, they\u0027re sounding practically conversa?tional, so maybe this won\u0027t be a complete disaster. They both wore black jeans and black T-shirts. Vicki wore sneakers and a black cotton sweater. He knew it was cotton; he\u0027d bought it for her. Fitzroy wore desert boots and a black linen blazer. He knew it was linen; he had one just like it, which he was going to get rid of the moment he got home. Celluci\u0027d never noticed before how much alike they looked.\n It wasn\u0027t the clothes. Thousands of vampire wanna?bes all over the world dressed with more undead style than these two.\n It wasn\u0027t their coloring. Although both were fair, Fitzroy\u0027s hair had more red in it and Vicki was a defi?nite ash blonde. It said so on the box.\n It was just, merely, simply, purely the way they were. They shared a belle morte-a deadly beauty. Celluci wasn\u0027t sure why the words came to him first in Italian; he was family-fluent only, and it wasn\u0027t a language he\u0027d ever thought in, but somehow English- plain old workaday English-didn\u0027t seem sufficient.\n And not only a deadly beauty; they also shared a complete and utter certainty in themselves and their place in the world.\n Certainty, Vicki had never been short of, but her sheer, bloody-minded belief that she was as right as anyone had been refined during the moment she locked eyes with Henry Fitzroy; refined and sharpened to a razor\u0027s edge. Fitzroy, of course, had always had it. It was one of the things Celluci\u0027d always hated. Always responded to.\n His heart began to beat in time to the power that throbbed between them. That surrounded them. That surrounded him. In that hallway, at that instant, watching the two of them watch each other, he under?stood the declaration, I am.\n And that is quite enough of that! Italian description arriving out the blue he could cope with, but blas?phemy was something else again! Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned; it\u0027s been two years since my last confession, but that\u0027s only because I\u0027ve been sleeping with a vampire. Yeah. Right.\n As a musical chime shattered the silence, he lifted his right foot, put it down, and almost miraculously followed the movement with his left-walking directly through their line of sight. \"I hate to break up a Kodak moment, kids, but the elevator\u0027s here.\"\n For a heartbeat the power gained a new focus. He could feel it flaying his back, simultaneously hot and cold, and he had a brief vision of Vicki\u0027s pale fingers shredding that chair. A little amazed he was still able to move, he stepped over the threshold into the eleva?tor and turned around. As expected, they were both staring at him. Vicki\u0027s mouth twisted up in a half smile; her sense of the ridiculous overwhelming the melodrama. Fitzroy had on his Prince of Darkness face. Celluci squared his shoulders, resisting the pull. No one survived a relationship with Vicki Nelson- alive or undead-without an equally strong sense of self and he was not going to bend the knee to Henry Fucking Fitzroy. \"You coming, Vicki?\"\n When she nodded and stepped toward the elevator, he stepped back to give her room.\n She paused, just inside, and her smile sharpened. \"Coming, Henry?\"\n Even Celluci could hear the challenge. Hell, a deaf man in the next building could\u0027ve heard the chal?lenge. \"Vicki ...\"\n One pale hand rose. A prince indicating there was no need for the masses to get involved. \"I don\u0027t think so. No.\"\n \"Why not? Afraid of losing your vaunted control? Too old to cope?\"\n \"Vicki!\" He might as well have saved his breath. The words were thrown back with all the finesse of a school?yard taunt and were just as impossible to ignore.\n His back against the wall, with Vicki between him and the exit, Celluci watched Henry advance toward the elevator. He wanted to grab her and shake her and demand to know what the hell she thought she was doing. Except he knew. Trust Vicki to drive her point home with a god-damned sledgehammer. I should\u0027ve taken the fucking stairs....\n When the doors closed, the fabric of Henry\u0027s blazer whispered against it. \"Parking level one, please.\"\n Head tilted slightly down, silvered eyes locked with shadow, Vicki pressed the button without looking at the panel.\n It wasn\u0027t the elevator that lurched into motion, Cel?luci realized; it was his heart.\n They shifted position simultaneously, too fast for a mere mortal to see them move. One moment they stood facing each other-Henry\u0027s back against the doors-the next Vicki stood to Celluci\u0027s left and Henry to his right. They continued to face each other but had gained what might be a survivable distance between them. A low, warning growl, felt not heard, vibrated through the enclosed space and lifted every hair on Celluci\u0027s body-not a pleasant sensation. Real?izing how little it would take to tip the balance into bloody chaos, he resisted the urge to scratch. Now if we can just make it to the lobby without anyone else getting...\n The elevator stopped on the seventh floor.\n The doors opened.\n Both vampires whirled to face the intrusion.\n Celluci didn\u0027t know exactly what the couple waiting at the seventh floor saw nor did he want to. Faces blanched of color and the spreading stain on the front of an expensive pair of silk pants gave his imagination information enough. Teeth clenched, he jerked for?ward and jabbed a finger at the panel.\n The closing doors cut off a rising, mindless wail. All at once, he was no longer worried about either of his companions losing control. He lost it himself.\n \"That\u0027s it!\" he snarled as he turned. \"I\u0027ve had it up to here ...\" The edge of his hand chopped at the air over his head. \"... with the two of you. You can both stuff that creature-of-the-night shit back where it be?longs! Did you see what you did to those two kids? Did you! Did either of you even notice they got in the way of your petty little power struggle?\"\n \"Petty?\" Vicki began, but he cut her off.\n \"Yeah. Petty. No one fucking cares which one of you\u0027s top ghoul except the two of you! And that\u0027d be fine except there\u0027s a whole goddamned world around you and neither of you seems to give a fuck who gets hit with the shrapnel!\"\n \"You\u0027re still alive.... \"\n He whirled toward Henry. \"Well, whoop de fucking do!\" Too furious to consider the consequences, he dared the dark gaze to do its worst.\n Henry\u0027s lips drew off his teeth.\n Vicki moved to deny him.\n Celluci threw out both arms. Muscles strained as he held them apart, one hand on each chest, the utter audacity of the attempt allowing him to succeed for one heartbeat. Two. Three. Teeth clenched, he refused to give in. His vision started to blur.\n Impossibly held, memory rose to overwhelm Hunger.\n The three of them had just laid Vicki\u0027s mother to rest for a second time. The two men were physically wounded and emotionally flayed-but Vicki had been dying. Henry had done what he could, but he hadn\u0027t been strong enough to finish; he needed more blood. Michael Celluci had offered his, even though he be?lieved that it meant he\u0027d lose everything.\n In over four hundred and fifty years of living as an observer in humanity\u0027s midst, it had been the most amazing thing Henry Fitzroy had ever seen.\n Until now.\n Detective-Sergeant Michael Celluci was very large and very strong; but it wasn\u0027t his physical strength that stopped the Hunger. It was the attitude that dared to announce, \"I will not allow this!\" even knowing he didn\u0027t stand, as he himself might say, a snowflake\u0027s chance in hell of being listened to.\n Once again, Henry was shown the quality of the man, and he was ashamed that he had to be reminded.\n Eyes still locked with Henry\u0027s, Vicki remembered what he remembered and felt what he felt. For the first time in his presence she was forced to think about someone else. Tearing her gaze away, staring in horror at the pulse throbbing among the corded muscle of Mike\u0027s neck, she replaced Henry\u0027s shame with her own.\n Celluci felt their surrender and allowed his arms to drop. He didn\u0027t have much choice. Without the pres?sure against them, he couldn\u0027t hold them up. The air still held a certain frisson, but strangely it didn\u0027t seem to be coming from either Vicki or Henry.\n \"I think we\u0027ve forgotten,\" said a quiet voice he al?most didn\u0027t recognize, \"that with great power comes great responsibility.\"\n \"I think I forgot what mattered.\" No mistaking Vicki\u0027s voice, but it had a ragged edge he didn\u0027t often hear.\n \"Same thing.\" To his surprise, Henry, just Henry, a man Celluci suddenly remembered he\u0027d come to re?spect and even like, held out a pale hand. \"My apolo?gies, Detective. I wish I could promise that it won\u0027t happen again, but I can\u0027t. I can promise that I\u0027ll do better in the future.\"\n His grip was cool, like Vicki\u0027s.\n Then he was gone.\n \"Where . . ?\"\n \"Parking level one. The van\u0027s on level two. I assume one of us is going to be using it?\"\n He blinked to clear the sweat from his eyes, and allowed her to slip her shoulder under his arm, taking most of his weight. \"You can have it. I\u0027ll never find parking.\"\n \"I\u0027ll drop you off.\"\n \"Fine.\" The parking level had the damp, unair-conditioned coolness that came from being deep under?ground. Celluci found himself thinking of graves. \"Vicki. What did I just do?\"\n \"You leaped a tall building in a single bound.\"\n \"I don\u0027t mean the physical... \"\n She sighed. It wasn\u0027t something she did much any more; she\u0027d lost the habit when she\u0027d lost the need to breathe on a mortal scale. \"You reminded us to be more, instead of less.\"\n He stopped and looked down at her. \"Try again.\"\n \"You told us to stop acting like idiots.\"\n \"Yeah, I know, but you don\u0027t usually listen.\"\n \"This time... \" She paused, then reached up and pushed the curl of hair back off his face.\n Henry listened.\n Wrapping her arms around him, she laid her cheek against his chest and found what comfort she could in the steady beat of his life. \"I love you, Mike.\"\n \"Hey, I believe you.\" His chin resting on the top of her head, he wondered just what it was she hadn\u0027t said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-debt-vicki-nelson-5/page-6.html","bookId":2468,"book":{"id":2468,"title":"Blood Debt (Vicki Nelson #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood Debt (Vicki Nelson #5) \n The book revolves around three main characters, Vicki Nelson, a Private Investigator and ex-cop, her lover, homicide detective Mike Celluci, and her ex-lover Henry Fitzroy, 450-year-old vampire, romance writer, and bastard son of Henry VIII.
