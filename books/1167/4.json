A LIFTED BURDEN","content":"He laid a hand on the fair head, then hastily bent over the paper. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I was pleased, Roger, because I didn’t know that dressmakers or their sewing-girls ever cared for the people they work for; and what do you think she went on to say?—‘Madame, don’t go to a second-class establishment. I know you like first-class things. Come to me when you want a gown, and it shall be given to you at cost price, with just a trifle to satisfy you for my work’—wasn’t that sweet in her, Roger? I just caught her hand and squeezed it, and then she laid a finger on her lips—‘Not a word of this to any one, madame.’ I sent her a basket of flowers the next day.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You are a good child,” said her husband, huskily. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Now go on to the next item,” said Margaretta, jubilantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n [44] \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Butter, twenty dollars’—what in the name of common sense does that mean?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Queer, isn’t it?” laughed Margaretta. “I’ll go back to the beginning and explain. You know, Roger, I am not such a terribly strong person, and I do love to lie in bed in the morning. It is so delicious when you know you ought to get up, to roll yourself in the soft clothes and have another nap! You remember that I had got into a great way of having my breakfast in bed. Well, madam in bed meant carelessness in the kitchen. We have honest servants, Roger, but they are heedless. After my shock from Grandma about economy, I said, ‘I will reform. I will watch the cents, and the cents will watch the dollars.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n “Now, to catch the first stray cent, it was necessary to get up early. I just hated to do it, but I made myself. I sprang out of bed in the morning, had my cold plunge, and was down before you, and it was far more interesting to have company for breakfast than to have no one, wasn’t it?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, rather.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You good boy. You never complained. Well, cook was immensely surprised to have a call from me before breakfast. One morning I found her making pastry, and putting the most delicious-looking[45] yellow butter in it. ‘Why, that’s our table butter,’ I said, ‘isn’t it, that comes from Cloverdale, and costs a ridiculous amount?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n “She said it was. \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Why don’t you use cooking-butter, Jane?’ I asked; ‘it’s just as good, isn’t it?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Well, ma’am, there’s nothing impure about it,’ she said, ‘but I know you like everything of the best, so I put this in.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Jane,’ I said, ‘never do it again. I’m going to economize, and I want you to help me. If you can’t, I must send you away and get some one else.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n “She laughed—you know what a fat, good-natured creature she is—and seemed to think it a kind of joke that I should want to economize. \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Jane,’ I said, ‘I’m in earnest.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then she sobered down. ‘Truth, and I’ll help you, ma’am, if you really want me to. There’s lots of ways I can save for you, but I thought you didn’t care. You always seem so open-handed.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Well, Jane,’ I said, ‘I don’t want to be mean, and I don’t want adulterated food, but my husband and I are young, and we want to save something for old age. Now you’ll help us, won’t you?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Honour bright, I will, ma’am,’ she said, and I believed her. I can’t stay in the kitchen and watch[46] her, but she watches herself, and just read that list of groceries and see what else she has saved.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “How have you found out the exact list of your economies?” asked Roger, curiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n “By comparing my bills of this month with those of the month before. For instance, sugar was so many dollars in June; in July it is so many dollars less. Of course, we must take into account that we have been entertaining less. Have you noticed it?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, but I thought it only a passing whim.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Some whims don’t pass, they stay,” said Margaretta, shaking her head. “Go on, Roger.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “One hundred and fifty dollars saved in not entertaining Miss Gregory—pray who is Miss Gregory?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “That society belle from Newport who has been staying with the Darley-Jameses.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “How does she come into your expenditures?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “She doesn’t come in,” said Margaretta, with satisfaction. “I haven’t done a thing for her beyond being polite and talking to her whenever I get a chance, and, oh, yes—I did give her a drive.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, but—” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Let me explain. If I hadn’t been taken with a fit of economy, I would, in the natural order of[47] things, have made a dinner for Miss Gregory. I would have had a picnic, and perhaps a big evening party. Think what it would have cost—you remember Mrs. Handfell?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Her husband made a face. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You never liked her, and I did wrong to have her here so much. Well, Roger, do you know I spent a large sum of money in entertaining that woman? I am ashamed to tell you how much. I had her here, morning, noon, and night. I took her up the river—you remember the decorated boats and the delightful music. It was charming, but we could not afford it, and when I went to New York she met me on Fifth Avenue, and said, ‘Oh, how do you do—so glad to see you. Be sure to call while you are here. My day is Friday.’ Then she swept away. That was a society woman who had graciously allowed me to amuse her during her summer trip to Maine. I was so hurt about it that I never told you.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “What an empty head,” said Roger, picking up the list. \\n\\n \\n\\n “It taught me a lesson,” continued his wife. “Now go on—do read the other things.” \\n\\n \\n\\n His eyes had run down to the total. “Whew,[48] Margaretta!—you don’t mean to say you have saved all this in a month?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, I do.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I haven’t felt any tightening in your household arrangements. Why, at what a rate were we living?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “At a careless rate,” said Margaretta, seriously, “a careless, slipshod rate. I bought everything I wanted. Flowers, in spite of our greenhouse, fruit and vegetables out of season, in spite of our garden, but now I look in the shop windows and say with a person I was reading about the other day, ‘Why, how many things there are I can do without,’—and with all my economy I have yet managed to squeeze out something for Grandma. I just made her take it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Roger’s face flushed. “Margaretta, if you will keep this thing going, we won’t have to give up this house.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I’ll keep it going,” said Margaretta, solemnly, “you shall not leave this house. It would be a blow to your honest pride.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The young man was deeply moved, and, lifting his face to the pale, rising young moon, he murmured, “Thank God for a good wife.” Then he[49] turned to her. “I wish some other men starting out in life had such a helper as you.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, wish them a better one,” said Margaretta, humbly; “but I know what you mean, Roger. A man cannot succeed unless his wife helps him.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Sometimes it makes me furious,” said Roger, warmly. “I see fellows down-town, young fellows, too, working early and late, straining every nerve to keep up the extravagance of some thoughtless young wife. Why don’t the women think? Men hate to complain.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaretta hung her head. Then she lifted it, and said, apologetically, “Perhaps they haven’t had wise grandmothers.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Roger smiled. “Upon my word, a man in choosing a wife ought to look first at the girl’s grandmother.” \\n\\n “‘My grandma lives on yonder little green, \\n\\n Fine old lady as ever was seen.’” \\n\\n \\n\\n chanted a gay voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Bonny,” exclaimed Margaretta, flying out of her seat. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were a remarkable pair as they came up the gravel walk together—the tall lad and the tall girl, both light-haired, both blue of eyes, and[50] pink, and white, and smooth as to complexion like a pair of babies. \\n\\n \\n\\n The elder man stared at them admiringly. Bonny was the baby of the orphan family that the sterling old grandmother had brought up. Strange that the grandson of such a woman had so little character, and Roger sighed slightly. Bonny was a mere boy, thoughtless, fond of fun, and too much of a favourite with the gay lads about the town. However, he might develop, and Roger’s face brightened. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, you dear Bonny,” said Margaretta, pressing his arm, “it was so good in you to remember your promise to come and tell me about your afternoon on the river. You had a pleasant time, of course.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Glorious,” said the lad. “The water was like glass, and we had a regular fleet of canoes. I say, Margaretta, I like that chap from Boston. Do something for him, won’t you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Certainly, Bonny, what do you want me to do?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Make him some kind of a water-party.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaretta became troubled. “How many people do you want to invite?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, about sixty.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Don’t you think if we had three or four of your chosen friends he would enjoy it just as much?” \\n\\n \\n\\n [51] \\n\\n \\n\\n “No, I don’t; what do you think, Roger?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I don’t know about him. I hate crowds myself.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I like them,” said Bonny. “Come, Margaretta, decide.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, my dear, spoiled boy,” said the girl, in perplexity, “I would give a party to all Riverport if it would please you, but I am trying dreadfully hard to economize. Those large things cost so much.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Bonny opened wide his big blue eyes. “You are not getting mean, Margaretta?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No, no, my heart feels more generous than ever, but I see that this eternal entertaining on a big scale doesn’t amount to much. Once in awhile a huge affair is nice, but to keep it up week after week is a waste of time and energy, and you don’t make real friends.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “All right,” said Bonny, good-naturedly. “I’ll take him for a swim. That won’t cost anything.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Now, Bonny,” said Margaretta, in an injured voice, “don’t misunderstand me. We’ll have a little excursion on the river, if you like, with half a dozen of your friends, and I’ll give you a good big party this summer—you would rather have it later on, wouldn’t you, when there are more girls visiting here?” \\n\\n \\n\\n [52] \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, indeed, let us wait for the girls,” said Bonny. \\n\\n \\n\\n “And in the meantime,” continued Margaretta, “bring the Boston boy here as often as you like, to drop in to meals. I shall be delighted to see him, and so will you, Roger, won’t you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Don’t know what you’re talking about,” said the young man, who had gone off into a reverie, “but it’s all right if you say so.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Bonny laughed at him, then, jumping up, said, “I must be going.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Where’s the dog, Margaretta?” asked Roger. “I’ll walk home with the boy.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “But your headache,” said his wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Is all gone—that prescription cured it,” said the young man, with a meaning glance at the sheet of note-paper clasped in his wife’s hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n She smiled and waved it at him. “Wives’ cold cash salve for the cure of husbands’ headaches.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “What kind of a salve is that?” asked Bonny, curiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Wait till you have a house of your own, Bonny,” said his sister, caressingly, “and I will tell you.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, as the man and the boy walked slowly away, she slipped into the hammock and turned her face up to the lovely evening sky. \\n\\n \\n\\n [53] \\n\\n \\n\\n “Little moon, I call you to witness I have begun a countermarch. I’m never more going to spend all the money I get, even if I have to earn some of it with my own hands!” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1690/49751.html","bookId":1167,"book":{"id":1167,"title":"The Story of the Gravelys","description":"简介： Certain chapters of this story first appeared in The Youths Companion.
