And believe me, sitting outside a spa for six hours is nothing compared to other things I’ve done.”\\n\\n A thought flashes through my mind. I wonder if he’s referring to what he’s done for Jake in the past. Or what he’s waited for Jake to do. Things I most definitely do not want to know.\\n\\n “Leaving you alone is more than my job’s worth—so it’s either I wait out here, or I come inside with you and wait in the waiting area or, worse, the treatment room.”\\n\\n I frown at him. “Fine,” I huff, sliding along the leather seat, “sit out here if you must.” Pausing, with my legs dangling out of the car, I ask, “Do you want me to send some food out for you?”\\n\\n “No, I’m set.” He indicates a thermos on the passenger seat. “If you need me at all, you make sure to call me straightaway,” he says just before I shut the door.\\n\\n “Yes, boss,” I mutter.\\n\\n I swear I hear him laughing just as the door closes.\\n\\n I watch him pull the car into a spot facing the entrance. I link arms with Simone, and we walk toward the doors.\\n\\n “You weren’t kidding when you said he literally goes everywhere with you.”\\n\\n “Nope,” I sigh.\\n\\n “Jake’s doing?”\\n\\n “Oh, absolutely,” I mutter as the doorman lets us in.\\n\\n I’m in heaven.\\n\\n Spa heaven.\\n\\n I’m having a facial, and it may be the best facial I have ever had.\\n\\n We’re into the afternoon. So far I’ve had a massage, a pedicure, and lunch. After my facial is done, I’m having a manicure.\\n\\n Simone is on the bed beside me, having a facial too.\\n\\n “So the book launch is next week?” Simone asks.\\n\\n “Yep.”\\n\\n “Wish I could be there.”\\n\\n “I wish you could be too.”\\n\\n I finished up Jake’s biography two months ago, and it’s been with the editor. Then back to me. Then back to the editor.\\n\\n This went on for a while, until we both settled on the final draft.\\n\\n The excerpts have already started publishing in Etiquette. Vicky said they have seen a 10 percent increase in sales already, which is amazing.\\n\\n “Is Vicky coming over for the launch?”\\n\\n “She is.” I smile.\\n\\n The launch is in New York as that’s where the publishing house is, so Jake and I are flying over for it. Vicky is meeting us there, and afterward she’s coming back to LA to spend a few days with me.\\n\\n I can’t wait.\\n\\n I haven’t seen her since I left London. Of course I’ve seen her via Skype, but it’s not the same.\\n\\n We have lots of shopping planned for when she’s here.\\n\\n “You really need to get your butt over to London,” Simone says. “It’s been way too long since you’ve been home.”\\n\\n “I know.” I let out a sigh. “I miss it.”\\n\\n “And London misses you. Maybe you and Jake could come over for a holiday after the baby is born.”\\n\\n “You know what,” I say, feeling uplifted at the thought. “We totally should. I could have my hen night in London. Most of my friends I want at my hen are there, and I’m sure Carly and Stuart would come over for it.”\\n\\n Jake and I have set the wedding for December. It won’t be the summer wedding we were originally wanting, but neither of us wants to wait until next summer. More than anything I want to be Jake’s wife. December gives me just enough time to lose my baby weight.\\n\\n “Speaking of London,” Simone says, her voice sounding tighter, “I saw Will last week.”\\n\\n My heart pauses.\\n\\n I turn my face to her and out of the therapist’s hands. “You did?” My voice wobbles, giving me away.\\n\\n I haven’t thought of Will in a long time. I don’t let myself.\\n\\n Because if I do, I remember how much I hurt him and how things were left the last time I saw him.\\n\\n “Hmm.” She nods, eyeing me carefully.\\n\\n I compose my features to neutral. “Why are you just telling me now?”\\n\\n “Because this is the first chance I’ve had. There’s always someone around.”\\n\\n Jake.\\n\\n “How’s he doing? Did he, um, ask about me?” I might have my face under control, but my mouth is set to give me away.\\n\\n “Do you really want me to answer that?”\\n\\n I pause.\\n\\n Do I?\\n\\n “Yes.”\\n\\n “No. He never mentioned you. But then, he wouldn’t have, because, he, um…well, he wasn’t alone when I saw him, Tru.”\\n\\n “Oh.” Pause. “He’s seeing someone?” Of course he is. Will is a really attractive guy. He’s smart and caring. A real catch.\\n\\n “Yes.”\\n\\n Is it wrong that I feel a spike of jealousy?\\n\\n I look up at the ceiling. Gritting my back teeth, I force a smile. “Well, that’s great news. I’m really pleased for him.”\\n\\n “No you’re not. But I know what you mean. Happy he’s happy. But it still stings, even though you feel you have no right for it to.”\\n\\n I love how Simone just gets me. God, I miss not seeing her every day. I’m going to hate it when she’s gone in a few days.\\n\\n I turn back to her. “I’d say that just about covers it.” Biting my lip, I ask my next question. “Is she anyone we know?”\\n\\n “No.” She smiles gently.\\n\\n That clarification makes me feel better. If it were someone I knew, I would have felt weird. Okay, weirder.\\n\\n “She seemed real nice, Tru,” Simone adds. “He looked happy.”\\n\\n This is exactly what I wanted for Will. I wanted him to be happy with someone who deserves him.\\n\\n “I’m real glad he’s happy.” I smile. “And I actually mean that.”\\n\\n “I know you do.” Simone turns her face back to the waiting therapist.\\n\\n “What does she look like?” I have to ask. Curiosity gets the better of me every time.\\n\\n “The complete opposite of you. Blonde, small-chested, tall.”\\n\\n “Peroxide, flat-chested, and lanky. I take it back. She’s not good enough for him.”\\n\\n “Bitch.” Simone flicks her gleaming eyes to me.\\n\\n “You expect any less?” I grin.\\n\\n “No.” She smirks, and we both start laughing.\\n\\n Dave is standing by the car as we exit the Four Seasons.\\n\\n “You had a good day?” he asks, opening the car door for us. I let Simone climb in first.\\n\\n “We had a fabulous day.” I beam. “How was yours?”\\n\\n “Well, the selection of cakes and fresh coffee that was brought out to me certainly brightened it up. Thank you, Tru. You’re a special kinda lady, you know that?”\\n\\n “You’re a special kind of guy, Dave. Not many men would sit in a parking lot and wait six hours for me.” I smile, giving his arm a pat.\\n\\n “Jake would.” He grins.\\n\\n “Yeah, but he’s just as crazy as you are!”\\n\\n Laughing, he helps me step up into the car and closes the door behind me with a firm clunk.\\n\\n I click my seat belt in just as Dave gets in the driver’s side.\\n\\n He glances over his shoulder. “Denny’s to drop off Simone, then straight home?” he checks.\\n\\n “Yep.”\\n\\n I kick my shoes off, still feeling all kinds of relaxed from my pampering, and settle back in my seat.\\n\\n I tune in to the music Dave is listening to—Pearl Jam.\\n\\n “Ooh, is this the Backspacer album?” I ask him.\\n\\n “How do you guess the album from just one song?” He gives me a quick look back. “You’re a little scary, Tru. You do realise that, don’t you?” he chuckles.\\n\\n “It’s a gift.” I nod, grinning. “And Dave, a Pearl Jam fan. How did I not know this? Seven months of riding practically every day with you, and you only now reveal your excellent music tastes to me.”\\n\\n “I always wait at least seven months before revealing my excellent music tastes to anyone.” He chuckles.\\n\\n I loosen my seat belt, leaning forward to talk to him.\\n\\n “Can you skip it forward to ‘Just Breathe’? It’s my favourite of theirs by far. Oh, and crank it up loud.”\\n\\n “I knew there was a reason I liked you.” He winks.\\n\\n He pulls up at a red light and takes the opportunity to jump the tracks ahead. Hitting “Just Breathe,” he turns the volume up loud. For a moment, I stay still, arms resting on the passenger seat, listening as the beautiful guitar melody fills the car completely.\\n\\n The baby gives me a gentle kick. I rub my hand over my tummy.\\n\\n A gentle kick, now there’s a first.\\n\\n “You like this song, huh?” I murmur. “I’ll get daddy to sing it to you when we get home.”\\n\\n The lights change to green, and Dave shifts the car into drive.\\n\\n I sit back, setting the seat belt back around my bump, and start singing along. Simone joins in. I reach over and squeeze her hand. She smiles. Then we hear Dave in the front singing.\\n\\n Simone giggles, and I sing through a smile at his baritone voice.\\n\\n Life’s good.\\n\\n Life is real good.\\n\\n I don’t think it gets any better than this, does it?\\n\\n Something from the right catches my eye. Still singing, still smiling, I turn my face to the window.\\n\\n And that’s when I see it.\\n\\n The smile drops from my face.\\n\\n They say your life flashes before your eyes in the moment you know you’re about to die.\\n\\n Well, I do see my life. But not the one I’ve lived: the one I expected to live.\\n\\n Having my baby. Watching him grow. Marrying Jake. Growing old with him. Living with him, loving him. Loving them both until I was old and ready to die.\\n\\n That’s what I see in those milliseconds as that car hurtles toward us.\\n\\n It’s not my time. Save my baby, please.\\n\\n My eyes lock with the driver’s. He looks almost…apologetic. I cover my baby with my arms, and then ________\\n\\n JAKE…\\n\\n CHAPTER NINETEEN\\n\\n I had the worst dream last night.\\n\\n Well, I think I did, because I woke up this morning with the worst feeling. Like impending doom. And I haven’t been able to shake it since.\\n\\n I’m so fucking ready to wrap this day up and get home to my girl.\\n\\n I haven’t spoken to Tru since she left for the spa. I didn’t want to disturb her, but normally I speak to her at least once during the day.\\n\\n I need my Tru fix, what can I say?\\n\\n I’ll call her now that she should be on her way home to see what she wants for dinner.\\n\\n While I switch off the amp, I pull my phone from my back pocket and speed-dial her cell.\\n\\n Voice mail.\\n\\n Weird. She never turns her phone off.\\n\\n Maybe she had to at the spa and forgot to turn it back on.\\n\\n I hear Katy Perry start to sing across the studio. Stuart’s fucking ringtone. He really is the epitome of gay at times.\\n\\n I unplug my guitar and put it in its stand.\\n\\n “Hey, gorgeous…what?…Wait, what!…Oh God, no.”\\n\\n It’s the “no” that makes me stop and turn to him, because he sounds…well, he sounds exactly like he did when we got the call that Jonny had died. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wethering-the-storm-the-storm-2/page-36.html","bookId":1999,"book":{"id":1999,"title":"Wethering the Storm (The Storm #2)","description":"Storyline: Wethering the Storm (The Storm #2) \\n Music journalist Tru Bennett has done the impossible: capture the heart of rock-star bad boy Jake Wethers.
