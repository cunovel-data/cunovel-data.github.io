The tour that was scheduled for autumn was pushed back, and they’ll be going on tour at the beginning of next year. Of course we’ll be going along, as is my dad. He’s ridiculously excited about it.\\n\\n I also went back to work. My book finally came out. The launch was moved to LA to make it easier for me, and it went great. The biography received really great early reviews, and sales went through the roof.\\n\\n Everyone wants to know and have a little piece of Jake Wethers, written by the woman who knows him best.\\n\\n I’m fine with that, because I have the real man as a whole here with me.\\n\\n I’m still working for Vicky, doing my column. The magazine is doing amazingly, thanks to Jake’s book.\\n\\n I know you’re probably wondering why I’m still working for Vicky—it’s not like I need to work, and I have JJ now. But I love it. I love writing and I love music, and I owe everything to Vicky. There’s no way I’m leaving her now, when the magazine is starting to take off.\\n\\n She keeps talking about making me partner. One day, I think yes. But right now I have my hands full with JJ, and then we’ll have the new baby coming too.\\n\\n Oh, did I not mention that I’m pregnant again? I’m six months gone. We’re having another boy. He’s our honeymoon baby.\\n\\n I’m going to let Jake name him.\\n\\n Simone’s pregnant too, which is awesome! Denny is like the cat that got the cream.\\n\\n They got married on Christmas Eve, and it was magical. I was bridesmaid, JJ page boy—we’re doing that a lot recently—and Jake and Tom were best men. Then Simone found out while they were on honeymoon that she was pregnant. They had gotten married while she was pregnant and she didn’t even know. At least they can’t be accused of a shotgun wedding.\\n\\n I know you’re wondering about Tom: Is he still the changed Tom of last year or is he back to the man-whoring Tom we all knew? All I’ll say is Tom is happy right now. The happiest I’ve ever seen him.\\n\\n I open the door to Stuart’s suite to find Jake and him sitting at the table, sharing a laugh, drinking whiskey.\\n\\n “Bit early to be on the hard stuff, isn’t it?” I joke.\\n\\n “Hey, go easy on me, gorgeous! It isn’t every day a man gets married. I need the Dutch courage.”\\n\\n “Dada!” JJ calls out, chubby arms reaching out for Jake.\\n\\n “Hey, little man. Come here, I missed you.” Jake takes him into his arms, nuzzling his black hair, while JJ’s chubby little hands grab at Jake’s face, causing Jake to laugh.\\n\\n Jake’s only been away from JJ for the morning. To say he’s attached to JJ is putting it mildly, and it goes both ways: JJ adores Jake.\\n\\n The love Jake has for our son wrecks my heart every single day, in the best possible way.\\n\\n I love watching them together. It’ll never get old. I know just how lucky I am to be here with them both. I treasure every single moment I have with them.\\n\\n I turn to Stuart, resting my hand on his shoulder. “You ready to go get married?”\\n\\n He gets to his feet and slings his arm across my shoulder. “Chica, to quote the wise words of our man Jake here…abso-fuckin’-lutely!”\\n\\n “Language in front of JJ!” Jake chastises.\\n\\n I can’t help but laugh. I never thought I would hear the day Jake would tell someone off for swearing. But he does, regularly.\\n\\n “Sorry,” Stuart apologises, flashing me a “here he goes again” look.\\n\\n “I saw that,” Jake mutters.\\n\\n “You were meant to,” Stuart replies.\\n\\n They’re like a pair of kids at times. And I wouldn’t have them any other way.\\n\\n We take the elevator down and meet Josh outside with Dan, his brother and best man.\\n\\n The way Stuart and Josh look at each other just melts my heart. I’m so glad Stuart found his someone. He truly deserves to be happy like Jake and I are.\\n\\n Taking each other’s hands, Stuart and Josh enter the room to get married where all our family and friends are waiting inside.\\n\\n The Mighty Storm family, and what a family we are.\\n\\n And when our kids grow up and ask about the story of Mummy and Daddy—how we met and how the Mighty Storm came to be—I’ll sit them down and tell them the story of how, once upon a long time ago, in Manchester, a girl moved next door to a boy… \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wethering-the-storm-the-storm-2/page-48.html","bookId":1999,"book":{"id":1999,"title":"Wethering the Storm (The Storm #2)","description":"Storyline: Wethering the Storm (The Storm #2) \\n Music journalist Tru Bennett has done the impossible: capture the heart of rock-star bad boy Jake Wethers.
