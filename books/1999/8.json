{"id":98059,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Etiquette is the magazine I work for. Vicky, my boss and close friend, is the sole reason Jake and I came back into each other’s lives. She landed an exclusive interview with Jake and sent me to do it. I’ve really missed my job, and the bonus of working means I need to talk to Vicky. Which is fab because I’ve missed her tons as well. God love Skype is all I can say. I called my folks too on the telephone; apparently Skype is just too technological for my mum and dad. But mostly, I miss Simone. I’m used to seeing her every day, and it’s taking some time getting used to not living in London with her anymore. I may have called her multiple times over the last few days. And maybe I cried a few times while on the phone too. I’m just so glad I have Stuart, my only friend in LA. Aside from Jake, of course. The downside of Jake not being around this week, apart from the obvious, is that we haven’t talked about the “no sex in his house” issue since that night. Just like we never talked about the “not having kids” issue on the island. It seems Jake and I are really good at ignoring things and avoiding discussions on important matters. I wonder if that’s partly why he’s spent so much time at the label this week. This is the longest Jake and I have gone without having sex since we got together. We’ve gone from multiple times daily while on the island to nothing at all. I know this is my doing, but I’m starting to worry big-time, because Jake is a highly sexual man. For Jake, having sex is as essential as breathing, and the fact that he’s not even trying to get it from me is worrying the shit out of me. I’m scared that if he’s not getting it from me, he’ll start to look elsewhere. Or maybe he already has. “You know, we could get pulled over by the cops. They might think you’re kidnapping me, having me blindfolded like this,” I say. “The windows are tinted, sweetheart.” “Of course they are.” I fold my arms over my chest at the sound of Jake’s soft laughter. “Well, with the speed you drive at, we’ll probably get pulled over for a ticket. Then what will you tell them?” “That my fiancée is kinky, and she gets her sexual kicks from me driving her around blindfolded. Then, and only then, will she let me fuck her.” “Jake!” “That, or we’re into BDSM, and you’re my submissive. And seeing you like this is how I get my kicks.” I feel his hand go to my leg, his rough fingertips gently stroking the skin just above my knee. This is the first time in five days that he’s touched me intimately. My pulse jumps and my whole body responds. “Do you realise how hard my dick is right now, just looking at you sitting there in those fuck-hot boots, that short skirt…blindfolded.” Holy fuck. “And what do you plan on doing with it?” My voice has taken on a husky tone all its own. “Something which will mean you being naked very soon, wearing only that scarf over your eyes and those come-fuck-me-now boots wrapped around my waist.” Sweet baby Jesus. I wonder if he’s taking us to a hotel for sex. My insides pool at the thought of Jake naked and inside me. I have to suppress a moan. His hand leaves my leg, and I hear the indicator tick-tocking a turn. Then he stops the car, lowers his window, and talks to someone. A man. I’m blindfolded here, and Jake is talking to some guy. Where the hell is he taking me? “Good to see you again, Mr. Wethers. I’ll open the gate for you.” “Thank you.” I hear Jake’s window close, and he starts to move the car slowly forward. A thought thuds into my head. Oh my God, what if he’s taking me to some kinky sex club? He was just talking about BDSM, and he did say I’ll be naked soon, wearing only this scarf and these boots. Oh, holy fucking mother of God. I’m not into that kind of stuff. I’m a straight-up-sex type of girl. A little dirty talk, sure. Maybe Jake tying me up…I’d happily give that a try. But not outright kinky stuff. I didn’t think he was either, to be honest. I know he’s a little dominant in the bedroom, which is really sexy, but I didn’t think whips and chains were his kind of thing. Maybe this is just another thing I didn’t know about him. Fuck. “Where are we going?” My voice comes out small. “You’ll know in about two minutes. Think you can hold on that bit longer?” “Are you taking me to a sex club?” I blurt out. I hear choked laughter. “Do you want me to be taking you to a sex club?” I can feel his body shaking next to me. “God, no!” “Good, because I’m not into sharing you with anyone.” He takes hold of my hand, sweeping a kiss across my knuckles. “I’ve already told you, Tru, you’re mine, and mine alone.” Jake stops the car and turns off the engine. Releasing my hand, he says, “Wait there, I’ll help you out of the car.” Doing as he asks, I wait until Jake gets out of the car, then opens my door. Taking hold of my hands, he guides me out. With his arm around me, he walks with me. “Okay, stand right there,” he says, positioning me in place. “You ready?” I can feel his warm breath on my face. “I’m ready.” I’m actually not. I’m really shitting it now as to what I’m going to be revealed to. I hate surprises. Why does he insist on surprising me all the bloody time? God, what if I don’t like whatever it is he wants me to see? Crap. Jake’s hands reach around to the back of my head, and he unties the knot holding the scarf in place. Loosening it from my eyes, Jake removes the scarf and stands aside. Blinking rapidly, I let my eyes readjust to the bright sun. Then I see a house. A huge house, situated about fifty feet before me. It’s single-story. Concrete, stucco, and wood—the combination is incredibly striking. It’s modern and stunning, and it’s instant love. If I could marry a house, this would be the house I would marry and have minihouse babies with. “What’s this?” I ask, pulling my eyes from the house to Jake. I find his eyes already on me. Nervous eyes. “A house.” He smiles tentatively. “Our house if you want it.” I turn from the house to face him. “You bought a house?” “I bought us a house. I put an offer in and they accepted. But if you don’t like it, I can pull out and we can find something else.” “No.” I glance back at the house. “It’s just…” “Tru, if you don’t like it, honestly, it’s fine.” “I love it.” I look back to him. “Really love it. Well, what I’ve seen so far, but if the outside is anything to go by, then…wow. Seriously, wow. But…it’s just…I imagine it wasn’t cheap.” I smile, uneasily. It feels clumsy and awkward on my lips. Couples buy houses together, share the mortgage. Jake buys a house outright. A house that I’m guessing cost millions of dollars. One that I have no chance of being able to contribute toward. “Call it birthday present number five.” I let out a high-pitched laugh. Since we came back into each other’s lives, Jake has been buying me special gifts to make up for the missed birthdays in the twelve years we were apart. “This is a little extravagant for a birthday gift, even for you.” “You can call it two birthday gifts in one if you want.” He moves closer and tucks my hair behind my ear. “More like a hundred in one. Wow, Jake. I’m just…speechless. Seriously bloody speechless. I just wish I had something to contribute.” “What do you mean?” He frowns. Looking down, I scuff the toe of my boot against the concrete. “Well…you know, normal people get a mortgage together, pay half each for the house. That kind of contribution.” Lifting my chin, he says softly, “We’re not most people, Tru. I told you when we were on the island that I want you to have the best of everything. This house is part of that. I want us to have a home together.” I know why he’s bought this house. Because of how I feel about his place. Jake has shopped for a new house and spent an inordinate amount of money, all because of me. As if he hasn’t got enough to deal with at the moment. I’m such a selfish bitch. “Jake…I’m sorry.” I drop my gaze. “I know why you bought this house. And I didn’t mean for you to sell your home and buy a brand-new house.” “Look at me.” His tone is firm, causing my eyes to lift to his. “You have nothing to be sorry for. And I had a house, Tru. It was never a home. You’re my home. I want you happy. And you’re not happy at my place, and honestly, I don’t fuckin’ blame you. Christ, if it was me, I’d have been climbing the goddamn walls if I had to live permanently in a house that you’d shared with—” He cuts off. He doesn’t say his name; he doesn’t have to. I know he means Will. Will, the man whose heart I broke when I had an affair with Jake. Will, whom I left so I could be with Jake. But it still didn’t stop me ping-ponging between the both of them in the beginning. I hate so much that I did that. And I hate the pain it still brings to Jake’s eyes. It’s like a blow to the gut. A reminder of how badly I handled everything. How much I hurt him. “You bought us a brand-new house so you could have sex with me again?” I smile, trying to ease the atmosphere. “You do realise getting us a hotel room would have been much cheaper.” He runs his finger down my cheek. “Sweetheart, I would give everything I own to be able to fuck you again.” He returns my smile with his sexy grin, and I know I have him back to good. “Well, it’s one hell of a shag-pad-to-be.” I tilt my head in the direction of the house. “Tru.” He grabs my face, trapping it between his hands. “I want to make love to you in every single room in that house. But it’s not just that. I want a fresh start for the both of us. This place is brand-new. It was completed a few months back. No one has lived in it before. It’s ours to fill with memories.” Tears well in my eyes, and one escapes, running down my cheek, trickling onto Jake’s hand. “You’re crying—good or bad?” “Good,” I reply as he wipes the wet away. “Really, really good.” Jake smiles, and it’s so beautiful it makes my heart ache. I wrap my arms around his neck and reach up on my tiptoes to meet his face. I kiss him gently on the lips. “I love you,” I whisper over his mouth. “I love you too, baby. Now come on,” he says, releasing me, sounding suddenly excited. “Let me give you the tour.” Jake opens the huge wooden front door to reveal an open-plan living room with high ceilings. Across from me are floor-to-ceiling windows that span the whole of the back wall, offering a panoramic view of LA.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wethering-the-storm-the-storm-2/page-8.html","bookId":1999,"book":{"id":1999,"title":"Wethering the Storm (The Storm #2)","description":"Storyline: Wethering the Storm (The Storm #2) Music journalist Tru Bennett has done the impossible: capture the heart of rock-star bad boy Jake Wethers.
