My jeans keep rubbing against it. It’s hurting like a motherfucker!”\n “You should learn to wear underwear, then, fuck-face,” Denny replies. Tom is in the backseat, rearranging his pants around his new tattoo.\n “No fuckin’ way! I’m not caging the beast up. I might take my jeans off.” He reaches to undo them.\n “Don’t you fuckin’ dare!” Denny yells. “I’m not sitting back here with you bare-assed!”\n “But I’m in pain,” Tom moans.\n “Tough. You are not getting your cock out while you’re back here with me.”\n “Stop being ridiculous. It’s not like I’m gonna try and fuck you. Not unless you ask nicely.” He laughs.\n “Can we swap seats?” Den asks me.\n “No fucking way! He’s all yours. I still can’t believe you got that tattooed above your dick,” I say to Tom. “You’re officially a fuckin’ idiot, you know that?”\n “Nah, the women will love it!” He grins. “Anyway, soft cock, why won’t you let us see your tattoo?”\n “Because it’s not meant for your eyes, fuck-wad.”\n “Ah fuck! You didn’t get ‘Tru’s bitch’ tattooed on yourself, did ya?”\n Denny snorts.\n “No, I fuckin’ didn’t.” Even I can hear the defensiveness in my tone.\n “You so fuckin’ did!” Tom says, leaning forward. “You got yourself branded with your chick’s name.”\n “Did you really?” Denny says, joining him.\n “Might have,” I say with a shrug.\n “There is officially no fuckin’ hope for you.” Tom sighs, falling back against his seat, opening his pants to reveal the gauze covering his tattoo. He takes a drink of the last remaining Jack from the bottle. We drank most of it in the shop. “You are officially turning into a woman. Next thing I’ll hear, you’ll be baking.”\n “Fuck off! Just ’cause I got my girl’s name tattooed on me, doesn’t mean I’m whipped. I just kinda love her.”\n I’m officially hammered if I’m admitting shit like this to Tom.\n “Oh God. Hold my hair back, Den, while I hurl.” Tom sticks his fingers in his mouth and rubs his shaved head with his other hand.\n Even I can’t not laugh.\n “Cut him some slack. We all have to grow up one day and fall in love, Tom.”\n “Not me. I’ll be riding a different pussy every night of the week ’til the day I die.”\n “One of them will catch you soon, man, and then you won’t know what fuckin’ hit you,” Denny says.\n He’s right about that. Except Tru caught me a long time ago. I just wasted too much time screwing around before I tried to get her back.\n “Where to now?” Tom asks.\n “Home.”\n “Fuck, that! It’s still early, and I need more alcohol to numb the pain of my tattoo and the fact that both my boys are whipped good and proper.”\n Looking at Dave, I say, “Take us to the next decent bar you see.”\n I let myself in, trying to be quiet so as not to wake Tru. The house is in complete darkness.\n Staggering around, I make for our bedroom, pulling my T-shirt off as I do, careful of my new tattoo. Tossing the shirt aside, I stumble into our bedroom, trying hard not to make a sound. When I see my girl asleep in bed, she stops me in my tracks.\n She’s wearing a satin nightgown, the pale pink one that I like with the lace on the hem. She’s got the sheets kicked back, and the nightgown has ridden up her thighs.\n She’s so fucking beautiful. And she looks so very fucking sexy.\n Her hair is all mussed up, spread across the pillow. Inch upon inch of her soft olive skin on show, just waiting for me.\n My dick instantly hardens.\n I need to taste her. Be inside her. I hate to wake her, but not enough that I’m not going to. I’ve got a raging hard-on the size of Texas, and it’s going nowhere until my girl has seen to it.\n She loves midnight sex, and she has been really horny lately. Even more so than normal. Not that I’m complaining. When Tru is eager for the snake, you’ll hear no complaints from me.\n Shucking out of my jeans and boxers, I kick them aside and climb up the foot of the bed.\n Starting at her ankle, I run my hand up her smooth skin and keep going until I reach her thigh.\n Stirring, she groans and rolls onto her back. “Hey, baby,” she says, sounding sleepy.\n My dick gets even harder at the sound of her voice.\n She fucking owns me, completely.\n “Hey,” I reply, kissing her shoulder, grazing my teeth over her skin, my hand still moving higher.\n “You have a good night?” she murmurs, but I can hear the sex in her voice. She’s so fucking responsive, and always so ready for me.\n “Hmm,” I reply.\n My fingers find her pussy, wet and waiting. No panties. God, she is so fucking hot.\n “And it just got a whole lot better,” I whisper in her ear.\n She sucks in a breath when my finger rubs over her clit.\n I push a finger inside her while I keep working on her swollen bud.\n She’s so tight. The way she clenches around my finger, I know she’s desperate to be fucked by me. About as desperate as I am to fuck her.\n “I missed you,” she whispers, her hand reaching for my cock.\n “Shit.” I wince when her fingers graze over my stomach, catching the gauze.\n “What’s that?” she asks, sounding worried. Sitting up, she turns the bedside lamp on.\n Her eyes hit my stomach. “What the hell happened?” Her eyes are wide. “Did you get into a fight? Jesus Christ, Jake.” She leans in closer to look at it, her fingers reaching, wanting to touch.\n “No, baby, it’s nothing like that. Don’t worry.”\n Fuck, I feel really nervous now. What if she thinks I’m a dumb fuck for getting it done?\n Raising her eyebrow, she says, “You have gauze covering your stomach and you’re telling me not to worry?”\n “I got a tattoo.” I smile awkwardly.\n “You did?” She looks confused. “You never said you were thinking of getting another one done.”\n I shrug. “I’ve been thinking about it for a while as a surprise for you. Getting it done tonight was more of a spur-of-the-moment thing.”\n “You got a tattoo, drunk?” She raises her eyebrows.\n God, she looks so fucking sexy right now. Hair all tousled, falling over her shoulders. The strap on her nightgown hangs low, her tits nearly falling out of it, practically begging me to release and suck on them.\n I’m just about to throw her down and screw her senseless, tattoo forgotten, when she says, “Can I see it?”\n I hesitate.\n She glances up at me.\n “Are you blushing, Jake Wethers?” She touches my cheek with her fingers.\n “No,” I say, defensive.\n I so totally fucking am. My face is as red as a fucking beet. Jesus Christ! What does she do to me?\n “Why don’t you want to show me it?” she asks softly.\n “I do. I just…look, I know I should have probably spoken to you about it before, but it just seemed like a good idea at the time.”\n “Jake?”\n “Yeah?”\n “Will you stop talking and just show me the bloody tattoo? I’m all intrigued now.”\n Sucking in a breath, I take the corner of the gauze and lift it. I peel it back, revealing the tattoo.\n I hear her sharp intake of breath, and I risk a glance at her face.\n Her hand is covering her mouth, her eyes wide, as she lets out a small laugh. “You had my name tattooed on you?”\n “Kinda,” I say, scrunching my face, looking down at it.\n Tru Love\n It’s across my stomach in arched script. God, I’m such a lame fucker.\n “You hate it. It’s lame, I know.”\n “No.” She cups her hands around my face. “I love it. I love you. Jake Wethers, you are the sweetest man I’ve ever known.”\n “I don’t want to be sweet,” I groan. “I want to be hard and hot.”\n “Oh, you’re definitely those too.”\n She kisses me, gentle at first, and then her kisses deepen. I part my lips, and her sexy little tongue slips into my mouth.\n I grab a handful of her hair, holding her to me, and meet her tongue with mine, stroking it.\n “Can you still…fool around?” she says into my mouth.\n “Sweetheart.” I grab her ass, hard. “It’ll take more than a tattoo to stop me from getting inside you. Death, maybe.”\n She giggles in my mouth, which pulses all the way down to my dick, and it throbs in response.\n “I suppose I should go on top. Can’t have you in pain, can I?”\n I stare down at her. She’s biting those sexy plump lips of hers, and I have the urge to bite them myself—and a whole lot more. Then she pushes me down on the bed and straddles my hips.\n I feel her wet pussy against my dick, and it feels so fucking good. She shifts, and starts to move up and down against it, creating friction, rubbing her sweet self all over me.\n “Jesus Christ,” I groan. “You are so fuckin’ sexy. You keep doing that and I’m gonna shoot my load any second.”\n “Can’t have that,” she says, slowing. “You want me to get that ice cream?”\n “Later, baby.” I’m practically salivating. “Right now I just need to be inside you.”\n Smiling that sexy smile of hers, she rises up on her knees. Taking hold of my dick, she positions it at the head of her entrance.\n She slides down onto me with a gentle moan, and I swear to God, I enter a state of nirvana for a moment.\n I’ve never felt anything like her before. I’ll never get used to how fucking amazing she feels around me. She was made to fit me.\n I stare up at her, watching as she pulls her nightgown off over her head, her long hair loose down her body, looking so fucking incredibly beautiful, and I wonder how the fuck I got so lucky.\n She’s the girl of my dreams, and more.\n Glancing down, she looks at my tattoo and grins. “Tru love, eh?”\n “Damn fucking right,” I growl. “Now love my cock, will you, sweetheart, before I die a death here?”\n Grinning, she rises up on her knees, then slowly slides back down my length.\n “You know I like to play slow, but right now, I need you to ride me good and hard, because you look way too fuckin’ hot up there to hold out.”\n She looks for somewhere to rest her hands for support, so I offer her my hands.\n Lacing our fingers together, my girl starts to move up and down, riding my cock fast, and I’m so close to coming it’s ridiculous, but I need to get her off first. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wethering-the-storm-the-storm-2/page-19.html","bookId":1999,"book":{"id":1999,"title":"Wethering the Storm (The Storm #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Wethering the Storm (The Storm #2) \n Music journalist Tru Bennett has done the impossible: capture the heart of rock-star bad boy Jake Wethers.
