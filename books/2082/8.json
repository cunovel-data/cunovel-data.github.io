{"id":88996,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Keller was tempted to check the wards, but she knew it wouldn\u0027t do any good. She wasn\u0027t sensitive enough to the witch energies to gauge them. They\u0027d been put up by Grandma Harman and checked by Winnie, and she would have to trust to that.\n The wards were keyed so that only the Dominick family and ordinary humans could come inside. No Night Person could enter except Nissa, Winnie, Keller, and Galen. Which meant, Keller thought with a grim smile, that any lost witch relatives of Iliana\u0027s mother who came by were going to get quite a surprise. An invisible wall was going to be blocking them from crossing the threshold.\n As long as nobody on the inside removed the wards, the house was safer than Fort Knox.\n Grandma Harman had also taken the limo, Keller found. Sometime during the night, it had been replaced by an inconspicuous Ford sedan parked at the curb. The keys had been in a manila envelope dropped through the mail slot in the front door, along with a map of Lucy Lee Bethea High School.\n Circle Daybreak was efficient. \"I didn\u0027t finish my hair,\" Iliana complained as Nissa hustled her to the car. \"It\u0027s only half done.\" \"It looks terrific,\" Winnie said from behind her. And the thing was, it was true. There was nothing that could make that shimmering waterfall of silvery-gold look anything less than beautiful.\n Whether it was up or down, braided or pinned or falling loose, it was glorious.\n I don\u0027t even think the little nitwit has to brush it, Keller thought. It\u0027s so fine that she couldn\u0027t make two hairs tangle if she tried. \"And I left my scarf\"\n \"Here it is.\" Keller lassoed her. The scarf was ridiculous, crushed velvet in muted metallic colors, with a six-inch fringe. Purely decorative.\n Iliana choked as Keller wound it around a few times and pulled it tight \"A little aggressive, Boss?\" Winfrith asked, extricating Iliana before she could turn blue. \"Worried about being late,\" Keller said shortly. But she saw Nissa eyeing her, too.\n Galen was the last to come out of the house. He was pale and serious-that much Keller saw before she shifted her eyes past him. Iliana\u0027s mother actually remained standing at the door with the baby in her arms.\n \"Say bye-bye to your sister\u0027s friends. Bye-bye.\" \"Kee-kee,\" the baby said. \"Kee-kee!\"\n \"Wave to him,\" Winfrith stage-whispered.\n Keller gritted her teeth. She half-waved, keeping her senses opened for any sound of an impending attack. The baby held out his arms toward her.\n \"Pui!\"\n \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\" Keller almost shoved Iliana into the backseat.\n Nissa took the wheel, and Galen sat up front with her. Winnie ran around to get in the back on the other side of Iliana.\n As they pulled out, Keller saw the outside of the house for the first time. It was a nice house-white clapboard, two and a half stories, Colonial Revival. The street was nice, too, lined with dogwoods that would be a mass of white when they bloomed. The sort of street where people sat outside on their rockers in spring and somebody was bound to have a stand of bees in the side yard making sourwood honey.\n Although Keller had been all over the United States, sent from one Circle Daybreak group to another, the hospital where she\u0027d been found had been near a neighborhood like this.\n I might have grown up someplace like this. If they\u0027d kept me. My parents...\n Do I hate her? Keller wondered suddenly. I couldn\u0027t. It\u0027s not her fault.\n Oh, no, of course not, the voice in her mind said. Not her fault that she\u0027s beautiful and perfect and has parents who love her and blue fire in her veins and that she is going to be forced, whether she wants it or not, to marry Galen...\n Which I don\u0027t care about, Keller thought. She was shocked at herself. When had she ever let emotion interfere with her job? She was allowing herself to be distracted-she had allowed herself to be distracted all morning-when there was something vitally important at stake.\n No more, she told herself fiercely. From now on, I think about nothing but the mission. Years of mental discipline came in handy now; she was able to push everything to the side and focus with icy clarity on what had to be done. \"-stopped a train in its tracks,\" Winfrith was\n \"Really?\" There was faint interest in Kiana\u0027s voice. At least she\u0027d stopped talking about her hair, Keller thought.\n \"Really. It was one of those BART trains in San Francisco, Like a subway train, you know. The two girls were on the tracks, and the Wild Power stopped the train dead before it could hit them. That\u0027s what the blue fire can do.\"\n \"Well, I know I can\u0027t do anything like that,\" Iliana said flatly. \"So I can\u0027t be a Wild Power. Or whatever.\" The last words were tacked on quickly.\n Nissa raised a cool eyebrow. \"Have you ever tried to stop a train?\"\n While Iliana bit a fingertip and pondered that, Winnie said, \"You have to do it right, you know. First, you have to make blood flow, and then you have to concentrate. It\u0027s not something you can expect to do perfectly the very first time.\"\n \"If you want to start practicing,\" Nissa added, \"we can help.\"\n Diana shuddered. \"No, thank you. I faint when I see blood. And anyway, I\u0027m not it.\"\n \"Too bad,\" Nissa murmured. \"We could use the blue fire on our side today.\"\n They were pulling up to a charming old brown brick high school. Neither Galen nor Keller had said a word throughout the ride.\n But now Keller leaned forward. \"Nissa, drive past it. I want to check the layout first.\"\n Nissa swung the car into a circular driveway that went past the school\u0027s oversized front doors. Keller looked right and left, taking in everything about the surroundings. She could see Winnie doing the same thing-and Galen, too. He was focusing on the same danger spots she was. He had the instinct for strategy.\n \"Go around the block and circle back,\" Keller said.\n Iliana stirred. \"I thought you were worried about me being late.\"\n \"I\u0027m more worried about you being dead,\" Keller interrupted. \"What do you think, Nissa?\"\n \"The side door on the west. Easy to pull up reasonably close, no bushes around it for nasty surprises to hide in.\"\n \"That\u0027s my pick, too. Okay, everybody, listen. Nissa\u0027s going to slow the car down in the right place. Slow down, not stop. When I give the signal, we\u0027re all going to jump out and go directly to that door. We are not going to pause. We are going to move as a group. Iliana, are you paying attention? From now on, you don\u0027t go anywhere unless Winnie\u0027s in front of you and I\u0027m beside you.\"\n \"And where\u0027s Galen?\" Iliana said.\n Keller cursed herself mentally. She wasn\u0027t used to working with a fourth team member. \"Hell be behind us-okay, Galen?\" She made herself look his way.\n \"Yes. Whatever you say.\" There wasn\u0027t the slightest hint of sarcasm in his face. He was dead serious. Absolutely miserable, earnest, and dead serious.\n \"And Nissa, once you\u0027ve parked, you join us and take the other side. What room\u0027s your first class in, Iliana?\"\n \"Three twenty-six,\" Iliana said dismally. \"U.S. History with Mr. Wanamaker. He went to New York to try to be an actor, but all he got was some disease from not eating enough stuff with vitamins. So he came back, and now he\u0027s really strict unless you can get him to do his impressions of the presidents-\"\n \"All right,\" Keller broke in. \"We\u0027re coming to the door.\"\n \"-and he\u0027s actually pretty funny when he does Theodore Roosevelt-or do I mean the other one-\"\n \"Now,\" Keller said, and pushed her as Winnie pulled.\n They all made it out smoothly, although Iliana yelped a little. Keller kept a good grip on her arm as they hurried to the door.\n \"I don\u0027t think I like this way of coming to school.\"\n \"We can turn right around and go back home,\" Keller said. Iliana shut up.\n Galen kept pace behind them, silent and focused.\n It was Nissa\u0027s usual position when the team wasn\u0027t heading for a car, and Keller couldn\u0027t help feeling the difference. She didn\u0027t like having someone behind her she couldn\u0027t trust absolutely. And although the enemies didn\u0027t seem to know yet that Galen was important, if they found out, he\u0027d become a target; Face it, she thought. This setup is a disaster, security-wise. This is a horrendous accident waiting to happen.\n Her nerves were wound so tightly that she jumped at the slightest sound.\n They shepherded Iliana to her locker, then up a staircase to the third floor. The halls were almost empty, which was exactly as Keller had planned it.\n But of course that meant they were late for class.\n Nissa slid in beside them just as they opened the door. They entered as a group, and the teacher stopped talking and looked at them. So did everybody else in the room.\n Quite a few jaws dropped open.\n Keller allowed herself a grim inner smile.\n Yeah, they were probably a bit of a shock for a small town. Four Night People-well, former Night People, anyway. A witch who was almost as small as Iliana, with a mop of vivid strawberry-blond curls and a face like a pixie on holiday. A vampire girl who looked like cool perfection straight out of a magazine, with cropped mink-colored hair and a strangely penetrating gaze. A shapeshifter boy who could have taken the place of any prince in a book of fairy tales, with hair like old gold and classically sculptured features.\n And, of course, a panther. Which happened to be walking on two feet at the moment, in the guise of a tall girl with a tense, wary expression and black hair that swirled witchlike around her.\n And, of course, there was Iliana in the midst of them, looking like a ballet dancer who had blundered in from the Nutcracker Suite.\n There was a silence as the two groups stared at each other.\n Then the teacher snapped shut his book and advanced on them. Keller held herself ready. He had a neatly trimmed beard and a dangerous expression.\n It was Iliana who took him on, though. She stepped forward before Keller could draw a breath to speak.\n \"Mr. Wanamaker! These are my cousins! Well- some of them are my cousins. They\u0027re from...California. Hollywood! They\u0027re here to... do research for . . \".\"\n \"We\u0027re really just visiting,\" Keller cut in.\n \"A new show about a high school. Not like that other show. It\u0027s more of a reality-based-\"\n \u0027It\u0027s just a visit,\" Keller said.\n \"But your dad is a famous producer,\" Iliana said. She added in an undertone to Mr. Wanamaker, \"You know, like that other producer.\"\n All eyes, including the teacher\u0027s, fixed on Keller.\n \"Yes-that\u0027s right,\" Keller said, and smiled while clenching her teeth. \"But we\u0027re still just visiting.\" She nudged Winnie with her elbow, but it wasn\u0027t necessary. Winnie was already staring at the teacher, brainwashing him with witch power.\n Mr. Wanamaker bunked. He weighed the book he was holding as if he were Hamlet holding Yorick\u0027s skull. He looked at it, then he looked at Winnie and blinked again.\n Then he shrugged and looked at the ceiling. \"Okay. Whatever. Sit down. There are some chairs at the back. And I\u0027m still marking you tardy.\" But Keller noticed that as he returned to his desk, his posture was very erect.\n She did the best she could to glare at Iliana without drawing any further attention to them. \"A famous producer?\" she whispered through her teeth.\n \"I don\u0027t know. It was more interesting than just saying you\u0027re friends.\"\n You don\u0027t need life to get any more interesting, Bubblebrain, Keller thought, but she didn\u0027t say anything. She found one thing out that surprised her, though, and she found it out quickly. Her job was made harder by the fact that everyone at the school was in love with Iliana.\n It was strange. Keller was used to getting attention from guys-and ignoring it. And Nissa and Winnie both were the type that had to beat them off with sticks. But here, although the guys looked at her and Nissa and Winnie, their eyes always seemed to return to Iliana.\n At break, they crowded around her like bees around a flower. And not just guys, either. Girls, too. Everyone seemed to have something to say to her or just wanted to see her smile.\n It was a bodyguard\u0027s nightmare.\n What do they see in her? Keller thought, frustrated almost beyond endurance as she tried to edge Iliana away from the crowd. I mean, aside from the obvious. But if all this is about her looks...\n It wasn\u0027t. It didn\u0027t seem to be. They weren\u0027t all hitting on her for dates.\n \"Hey, Iliana, my granddaddy loved that get well card you made.\"\n \"Illie, are you going to tie the ribbons this year for the Christmas benefit bears? Nobody else can make those teeny-weeny bows.\"\n \"Oh, Iliana, something awful! Bugsy had five puppies, and Mom says we can\u0027t keep them. We\u0027ve got to find them all homes.\" \"Iliana, I need help-\" \"Wait, Iliana, I have to ask you-\" Okay, but why come to her? Keller thought as she finally managed to detach the girl from her fan club and steer her into the hall. I mean, she can hardly be the best problem solver in this school, can she?\n There was one guy who seemed to like Iliana for the obvious. Keller disliked him on sight. He was good-looking in a carefully manicured way, with deep chestnut hair, deep blue eyes, and very white teeth. He was wearing expensive clothes, and he smiled a lot, but only at Iliana.\n \"Brett,\" Iliana said as he accosted them in the hall.\n Brett Ashton-Hughes. One of the rich twins who were having the birthday party on Saturday night Keller disliked him even more, especially when he gave her a coolly appreciative once-over before returning his attention to Iliana.\n \"Hey, blondie. You still coming Saturday?\"\n Iliana giggled. Keller stifled the urge to hit something.\n \"Of course, I\u0027ll be there. I wouldn\u0027t miss it.\"\n \"Because, you know, it would kill Jaime if you didn\u0027t come. We\u0027re only inviting a few people, and well have the whole west wing to ourselves. We can even dance in the ballroom.\"\n Diana\u0027s eyes went dreamy. \"That sounds so romantic. I always wanted to dance in a real old-fashioned ballroom. I\u0027ll feel just like Scarlett O\u0027Hara.\"\n No, Keller thought. No, no, no. No way is she going there. She\u0027s going to the Solstice Ceremony, where the shapeshifters and the witches are meeting, even if I have to drag her by the hair.\n She caught Nissa\u0027s eye and saw that Nissa was thinking the same. Galen and Winnie were simply watching Brett with troubled looks on their faces.\n \"Yeah, and I can be Brett Butler,\" Brett was saying. \"Plus, the indoor swimming pool will be heated. So if you get tired of being Scarlett, you can be a mermaid for a while.\"\n \"It sounds wonderful! Tell Jaime I said so.\"\n Winnie bit her lip. Keller got a fresh grip on Diana\u0027s arm and started guiding her away.\n \"So it\u0027s a promise, right?\" Brett called after her.\n Keller squeezed.\n \"Yes, but-oh.\" Iliana managed to smile and wince at the same time, her arm limp in Keller\u0027s grasp. \"Oh, Brett, there\u0027s one thing. I\u0027ve got my cousin and her friends staying with me.\"\n Brett hesitated an instant, giving each girl on Keller\u0027s team the appraising look. Then he shrugged and flashed a smile. \"Hey, no problem. Bring them all. Your friends are our friends.\"\n \"That wasn\u0027t what I was trying to tell you,\" Keller said when they were away from Brett. Iliana was rubbing her arm with an aggrieved expression. \"Then what? I thought it would be fun for you to go.\" \"What do you mean, \u0027then what\u0027? You\u0027re going to the Solstice Ceremony that night, so you shouldn\u0027t have promised him.\" \"I am not going to the Solstice Ceremony that night, because I\u0027m not the one you\u0027re looking for.\" It wasn\u0027t the time to argue. Keller kept her moving down the hall. Keller wasn\u0027t happy. Her nerves were all prickling, and she felt like a cat with its fur standing on end. Very soon, Iliana wasn\u0027t happy, either. \u0027I always eat lunch in the cafeteria!\" \"Not today,\" Keller said, knowing she sounded as brusque and tired as she felt. \"We can\u0027t risk it You\u0027ve got to be in a room, alone, someplace where we can control access to you.\" \"The music room,\" Winnie said helpfully. \"I saw it on the map and asked a girl about it in English\n class. It\u0027s open during lunch, and there\u0027s only one door.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to-\"\n \"You don\u0027t have a choice!\"\n Iliana sulked in the music room. The problem was that she wasn\u0027t very good at sulking, and you could only tell she was doing it because when she offered her cookies to Nissa, she only insisted once. Keller paced nervously in the hallway in front of the door. She could hear Winnie and Galen inside talking. Even Galen\u0027s voice sounded white-faced and strained.\n Something\u0027s wrong... I\u0027ve had a bad feeling ever since we got to this school... and it isn\u0027t any easier having him around.\n Part of her was worried that he might take this opportunity to come and try to talk to her. And part of her, a very deep inside part, was furious because he wasn\u0027t doing it.\n Goddess! I\u0027ve got to get my mind clear. Every second that I\u0027m not in control of my emotions means an opportunity for them.\n She was so absorbed in yelling at herself that she almost missed the girl walking past her. Keller was almost at the end of the hall, and she had to do a double-take to realize that somebody had just calmly slipped by.\n \"Hey, wait,\" she said to the girl\u0027s back. The girl was medium-sized and had hair the soft brown of oak leaves, slightly longer than shoulder-length. She was walking fast She didn\u0027t stop. \"Wait! I\u0027m talking to you, girl! That door is off limits.\"\n The girl didn\u0027t turn, didn\u0027t even pause. She was almost at the door to the music room. \"Stop right there! Or you\u0027re going to get hurt!\"\n Not even a hesitation in the girl\u0027s step. She turned into the door. A thousand red alerts went off in Keller\u0027s head.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-witchlight-night-world-9/page-8.html","bookId":2082,"book":{"id":2082,"title":"Night World : Witchlight (Night World #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Witchlight (Night World Book 9) \n Keller is a black panther.
