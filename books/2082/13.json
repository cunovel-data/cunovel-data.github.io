{"id":100819,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Unfortunately, Keller didn\u0027t. \"Well just have to work something out,\" she said to her team. \"Make it as safe as possible, and stick by her every minute.\"\n Winnie and Nissa exchanged unhappy glances. But they didn\u0027t say anything.\n Keller looked at Diana. \"The one thing is, you have to be at the Solstice Ceremony at midnight They\u0027re meeting in Charlotte, so that\u0027s about twenty minutes\u0027 drive, and we\u0027d better leave plenty of time for safety. Say an hour at the least. If you\u0027re not there, where the shapeshifters and the witches are meeting, at exactly midnight-\"\n \"My coach turns into a pumpkin\u0027 Diana said tartly. She swabbed her nose with a tissue.\n \"No, the shapeshifters walk out, and any chance of an alliance is gone forever.\"\n Diana sobered, stared at the table. Then she met Keller\u0027s eyes. \u0027I\u0027ll be there. I know it, and you know why? Because you\u0027ll get me there.\"\n Keller stared at her, astonished. She heard Winnie give a short yelp of laughter and saw that Nissa was hiding a smile.\n Then she felt a smile pulling up the corner of her own lip. \"You\u0027re right; I will. Even if I have to drag you. Here, shake on it.\" They did. And then Diana turned to Galen. She had been watching him out of the corner of her eye ever since she\u0027d first started talking. And now she looked hesitant again.\n \"If there\u0027s anything-any reason I shouldn\u0027t do it.. .\" She fumbled to a stop. Keller kicked Galen\u0027s ankle hard.\n He glanced up. He still didn\u0027t look like the Galen she knew. Talking about the dragons had done something to him, thrown a shadow across his face and turned his eyes inward. And Diana\u0027s announcement hadn\u0027t lightened anything.\n Keller stared at him intently, wishing she had telepathy. Don\u0027t you dare, she was thinking. What\u0027s wrong with you? If you mess this up, after all the work we\u0027ve done and with so much at stake...\n Then she realized something. Before, when he\u0027d been telling the history of the dragons, Galen had looked brooding and a little scary. Now, he still looked brooding but unutterably sad. Heart-stricken-and full of such regret.\n She could almost hear his voice in her head. Keller, I\u0027m sorry...\n Don\u0027t be an idiot, Keller thought, and maybe she wasn\u0027t telepathic, but she was certain that he could read her eyes. What have you got to be sorry for? Hurry up and do what you\u0027re supposed to do. Her heart was pounding, but she kept her breathing tightly controlled. Nothing mattered but Circle Daybreak and the alliance. Nothing. To think of anything else at a time like this would be the height of selfishness.\n And love is for the weak.\n Galen dropped his eyes, almost as if he had lost a battle. Then he turned slowly from Keller to Diana. Who was standing with tears about to fall, hanging like diamonds on her lashes. Keller felt a twisting inside her chest.\n But Galen, as always, was doing exactly the right thing. He took Diana\u0027s hand gently and brought it to his cheek in a gesture of humility and simplicity. He could do that without stopping looking noble for a moment. After all, he was a prince. \"I\u0027d be very honored to go through the promise ceremony with you,\" he said, looking up at her. \"If you can bring yourself to do it with me. You understand everything I was telling you before- about my family...\"\n Iliana blinked and breathed again. The tears had magically disappeared, leaving her eyes like violets freshly washed in rain. \"I understand all that. It doesn\u0027t matter. It doesn\u0027t change anything about you, and you\u0027re still one of the best people I\u0027ve ever met.\" She blinked again and smiled.\n Nobody could have resisted it. Galen smiled back.\n \"Not nearly as good as you.\"\n They stayed that way for a moment, looking at each other, holding hands-and glowing. They looked perfect together, silver and gold, a fairytale picture.\n That\u0027s it. It\u0027s done. She\u0027ll have to go through the ceremony now, Keller thought. As long as we can keep her alive, we\u0027ve recruited a Wild Power. Mission accomplished.\n I\u0027m really happy about this.\n So why was there a heaviness in her chest that hurt each time she breathed?\n It was late that afternoon when the second call came.\n \"Well, they found the driver of the car,\" Nissa said.\n Keller looked up. They\u0027d moved the box full of scrolls to Diana\u0027s bedroom when Mrs. Dominick came back from shopping. Now they had them untidily spread out on the floor while Iliana lay on the bed heavy-eyed and almost asleep. She perked up when Nissa came in.\n \"Who was it?\"\n \"A shapeshifter. Name of Fulton Arnold. He lives about ten miles from here.\"\n Keller tensed. \"Arnold. \u0027Eagle ruler.\u0027\" She glanced at Galen.\n He nodded grimly. \"The eagles are going to have some explaining to do. Damn it, they\u0027ve always been hard to get along with, but this...\"\n \"So it was connected with the Night World,\" Winnie said. \"But did Circle Daybreak figure out why?\"\n Nissa sat down on the chair in front of Iliana\u0027s gold-and-white vanity. \"Well, they\u0027ve got an idea.\" She looked at Galen. \"You\u0027re not going to like it.\"\n He put down a piece of scroll and sat up very straight, bleak and self-contained. \"What?\"\n \"You know all our theories about why shapeshifters are attacking humans? Whether it\u0027s just the common \u0027shifter on the street or orders from the First House and so on? Well, Circle Daybreak thinks it\u0027s orders, but not from the First House.\"\n \"The shapeshifters wouldn\u0027t take orders from vampires,\" Galen said stiffly. \"So the Night World Council is out.\"\n \"They think it\u0027s the dragon.\"\n Keller shut her eyes and hit herself on the forehead.\n Of course. Why hadn\u0027t she thought of it? The dragon giving direct orders, setting himself up as a legendary ruler who had returned to save the shapeshifters. \"It\u0027s like King Arthur coming back,\" she muttered.\n On her bed, Iliana was frowning in shock \"But you said dragons were evil. You said they were cruel and horrible and tried to destroy the world.\"\n \"Right,\" Keller said dryly. Only Iliana would think that this constituted a reason not to follow them. \"They were all those things. But they were also strong. They kept the shapeshifters on top. I\u0027m sure there are plenty of \u0027shifters who\u0027d welcome a dragon back.\" She looked at Galen in growing concern as she figured it out. \"They\u0027re going to think it means a new era for them, maybe even a return to shapeshifter rule. And if that\u0027s what they think, nothing the First House says is going to make any difference. Even the mice are going to rally \u0027round Azhdeha.\"\n \"You mean the promise ceremony is no good?\" Iliana sat up. The interesting thing was that she didn\u0027t look particularly relieved-in fact, Keller thought, she looked positively dismayed.\n \"No, so don\u0027t even get that idea,\" Keller said shortly. \"What it means is-\" She stopped dead, realizing suddenly what it did mean. \"What it means is...\"\n Galen said, \"We have to kill the dragon.\"\n Keller nodded. \"Yeah. Not just fight it. We have to get rid of it. Make sure it\u0027s not around to give orders to anybody. It\u0027s the only way to keep the shapeshifters from being split.\"\n Iliana looked down soberly at the snowstorm of paper that covered her floor. \"Does any of that stuff tell you how to kill a dragon?\"\n Keller lifted a piece of parchment, dropped it. \"So far, none of this stuff has told us anything useful.\"\n \"Yeah, but we haven\u0027t even looked through half of it,\" Winnie pointed out. \"And since you and Galen are the only ones who can read the writing, the parts Nissa and I have gone through don\u0027t really count.\"\n There was definitely a lot of work left. Keller stifled a sigh and said briskly, \"Well, we don\u0027t need to worry about killing the dragon right now. If we can fight him off long enough to get through the promise ceremony, we can worry about destroying him afterward. Winnie, why don\u0027t you and Nissa start trying to figure out a way to protect Iliana at the party Saturday? And Galen and I can stay up tonight and read through these scrolls.\"\n Winnie looked concerned. \"Boss, you\u0027re trying to do too much. If you don\u0027t sleep sometime, you\u0027re going to start cracking up.\"\n I\u0027ll sleep on Sunday,\" Keller said firmly. \"When it\u0027s all over.\"\n Keller had meant that she and Galen could study the scrolls separately that night. But when everybody else headed for their bedrooms, he stayed in the family room with her and watched the eleven o\u0027clock news. More animal attacks.\n Keller pulled out her pile of scroll fragments. It was her way of saying good night, and much easier than looking at him.\n But he just said quietly, \"I\u0027ll get my half,\" and brought them out.\n Keller felt uncomfortable. It wasn\u0027t that she could find any fault with what he was doing. He was studying his pieces of scroll intently and letting her do the same.\n But every now and then, he would look at her. She could feel his eyes on her, feel that they were serious and steady and that he was waiting for her to look up.\n She never did.\n And he never said anything. After a while, he would always go back to his parchments. They worked on and on in silence.\n Still, Keller was aware of him. She couldn\u0027t help it She was a panther; she could sense the heat of his body even three feet away. She could smell him, too, and he smelled good. Clean and a little bit like the soap he used, and even more like himself, which was something warm and golden and healthy. Like a puppy with a nice coat on a summer afternoon.\n It was very, very distracting. Sometimes the words on the scrolls blurred in front of her eyes. But worst of all, worse than feeling his heat or smelling his scent or knowing his eyes were on her, was something more subtle that she couldn\u0027t exactly define. A connection. A sense of tension between them that she could almost touch. The air was buzzing with it. It lifted up the little hairs on Keller\u0027s arms. And no matter how she tried to will it away, it only seemed to grow and grow. Somehow the silence made it worse, made it more profound. I have to say something, Keller thought.\n Something casual, to show that I\u0027m not affected.\n She stared at the scrolls, which she was beginning to hate. If only she could find something useful... Then she saw it. Right there on the scroll she was studying.\n \"Galen. There\u0027s something here-in a copy of the oldest records about dragons. It\u0027s talking about what the dragons can do, what their powers are besides the dark energy.\"\n She read from the scroll, hesitating on words that were less familiar to her. \" \u0027A dragon has only to touch an animal and it is able to assume that animal\u0027s form, know all that the animal knows, do all that the animal can do. There is no\u0027-I think it says \u0027limit\u0027-\u0027on the number of shapes it can master. Therefore, it is a true shapeshifter and the only one worthy of the name.\u0027 I told you this stuff was old,\" she added. \"I think the original was written by the dragons\u0027 press agent during the war.\"\n \" \u0027No limit on the number of shapes it can master,\u0027\" Galen repeated with growing excitement. \"That makes sense, you know. That\u0027s what the First House has inherited, only in a diluted form. Being able to pick whichever shape we want to become- but only the first time. After that, we\u0027re stuck with it, of course.\"\n \"Do you have to touch an animal to learn its shape?\"\n He nodded. \"That\u0027s how we choose. But if a dragon can touch anything and assume its shape- and change over and over...\" His voice trailed off. \"Yeah. It\u0027s going to be awfully difficult to spot them,\"\n Keller said. The tension in the air had been somewhat discharged by talking, and she felt a little calmer. At least she could talk without the words sticking in her throat.\n But Galen wasn\u0027t helping. He leaned closer, peering down at her scroll. \"I wonder if it says anything else, anything about how to identify... wait. Keller, look down here at the bottom.\"\n To do it, she had to bend her head so that his hair brushed her cheek. \"What?\"\n \"Horns, something about horns,\" he muttered almost feverishly. \"You\u0027re better at translating than I am. What\u0027s this word?\"\n \" \"Regardless\u0027? No, it\u0027s more like \u0027no matter.\u0027\" She began to read. \" \u0027But no matter what form it takes, a dragon may always be known-\u0027\" \" \u0027By its horns,\u0027\" he chimed in, reading with her. They finished together, helping each other. \"\u0027A dragon has from one to three horns on its forehead, and in some rare cases four. These horns\u0027\"-both their voices rose-\" \u0027which are the seat of its power are most cruelly removed by the witches who capture them, to steal from them the power of changing.\u0027\"\n They both stopped. They kept staring at the parchment for what seemed endless minutes to\n Keller. Galen was gripping her wrist so hard that it hurt.\n Then he said softly, \"That\u0027s it. That\u0027s the answer.\"\n He looked up at her and gave her wrist a little shake. \"That\u0027s the answer. Keller, we did it; we found it.\"\n \"Shh! You\u0027re going to wake up the whole house.\" But she was almost as shaky with excitement as he was. \"Let me think. Yeah, that guy Azhdeha could have had horns. His hair was all messy, covering his forehead, and I remember thinking that was a little strange. The rest of him looked so neat.\"\n \"You see?\" He laughed breathlessly, exultantly.\n \"Yes. But-well, do you have any idea how hard it would be to try and take off a dragon\u0027s horns?\"\n \"No, and I don\u0027t care. Keller, stop it, stop trying to dampen this! The point is, we found it. We know something about dragons that can hurt them. We know how to fight!\"\n Keller couldn\u0027t help it. His exhilaration was infectious. All at once, all the bottled-up emotions inside her started to come out. She squeezed his arm back, half laughing and half crying.\n \"You did it,\" she said. \"You found the part.\"\n \u0027It was on your scroll. You were just about to get there.\"\n \"You were the one who suggested we look at the scrolls in the first place.\"\n \"You were the one-\" Suddenly, he broke off. He had been looking at her, laughing, their faces only inches apart as they congratulated each other in whispers. His eyes were like the woods in summertime, golden-green with darker green motes in them that seemed to shift in the light.\n But now something hike pain crossed his face. He was still looking at her, still gripping her arm, but his eyes went bleak.\n \"You\u0027re the one,\" he said quietly.\n Keller had to brace herself. Then she said, \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n \"Yes, you do.\"\n He said it so simply, so flatly. There was almost no way to argue.\n Keller found one. \"Look, Galen, if this is about what happened in the library-\"\n \"At least you\u0027re admitting that something happened now.\"\n \"-then I don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong with you. We\u0027re both shapeshifters, and there was a minute when we sort of lost our objectivity. We\u0027re under a lot of stress. We had a moment of... physical attraction. It happens, when you do a job like this; you just can\u0027t take it seriously.\"\n He was staring at her. \"Is that what you\u0027ve convinced yourself happened? \u0027A moment of physical attraction?\u0027\"\n The truth was that Keller had almost convinced herself that nothing had happened-or convinced her mind, anyway.\n \"I told you,\" she said, and her voice was harsher than she\u0027d heard it for a long time. \"Love is for weak people. I\u0027m not weak, and I don\u0027t plan to let anything make me weak. And, besides, what is your problem? You\u0027ve already got a fianc��e. Diana\u0027s brave and kind and beautiful, and she\u0027s going to be very, very powerful. What more could you want?\"\n \"You\u0027re right,\" Galen said. \"She\u0027s all those things. And I respect her and admire her-I even love her. Who could help loving her? But I\u0027m not in love with her. I\u0027m-\"\n \"Don\u0027t say it.\" Keller was angry now, which was good. It made her strong. \"What kind of prince would put his personal happiness above the fate of his people? Above the fate of the whole freaking world, for that matter?\"\n \"I don\u0027t!\" he raged back. He was speaking softly, but it was still a rage, and he was a little bit frightening. His eyes blazed a deep and endless green. \"I\u0027m not saying I won\u0027t go through with the ceremony. All I\u0027m saying is that it\u0027s you I love. You\u0027re my soulmate, Keller. And you know it.\"\n Soulmate. The word hit Keller and ricocheted, clunking inside her as it made its way down. When it hit bottom, it settled into a little niche made especially for it, fitting exactly.\n It was the word to describe what had really happened in the library. No stress-induced moment of physical attraction and no simple romantic flirtation, either. It was the soulmate principle.\n She and Galen were soulmates.\n And it didn\u0027t matter a bit, because they could never be together. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-witchlight-night-world-9/page-13.html","bookId":2082,"book":{"id":2082,"title":"Night World : Witchlight (Night World #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Witchlight (Night World Book 9) \n Keller is a black panther.
