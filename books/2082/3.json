{"id":88991,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Keller turned her head quickly.\n Nissa was standing there, cool and imperturbable as always, one hand on her hip. Her short mink-colored hair wasn\u0027t even ruffled; her eyes, just a shade or two darker, were steady. And she was holding an ironwood fighting stick with a very sharp point.\n Keller growled faintly in relief. You couldn\u0027t ask Nissa to be creative-her mind didn\u0027t work that way. But on any question of logic, she was unbeatable, and she had nerves of ice. More important right now, she was a superb fighter.\n \"If you want to play, why don\u0027t you try me?\" she suggested, and whipped the fighting stick around expertly a few times. It whistled in the air, traced a complicated figure, and ended up casually across her shoulder. Then she slowly extended the point toward the vampire\u0027s throat.\n \"Yeah, and don\u0027t leave me out.\" This voice was husky and shaky but still grim. It came from behind the counter. Winnie was pulling herself up. She coughed once, then stood straight, facing the vampire.\n Energy, orange and pulsating, flared between her cupped hands. Witch power.\n You\u0027re alive, Keller thought. She couldn\u0027t suppress the flash of relief.\n The vampire looked from one girl to the other. Then he glanced at Keller, who was lying on her side, feebly trying to make her legs work. Her tail lashed furiously.\n \"Come on!\" the other vampire shouted. He was staggering under the weight of the dragon, heading for the door. \"Let\u0027s get Azhdeha out of here. He\u0027s the most important thing.\"\n The first vampire hesitated one instant, then whirled and plunged after his friend. Together, they hustled the dragon out into the mall.\n Then they were gone.\n Keller gave one final gasping snarl and felt herself change. This time, it felt more like a snail falling out of a shell. Her claws dissolved, her tail withered, and she slumped into her human body.\n \"Boss! Are you okay?\" Winnie came toward her, a little unsteadily.\n Keller raised her head, black hair falling on either side to the floor. She pushed herself up with her arms and looked around, taking stock.\n The shop was quiet It was also a wreck. Winnie\u0027s impact with the wall had knocked off most of the decorative plates and clocks there. Keller\u0027s fight with the dragon had trashed a lot of the shelves.\n There were shattered Christmas ornaments everywhere, little glittering fragments of scarlet and holly green and royal purple. It was like being in a giant kaleidoscope.\n And outside, chaos was gathering. The entire fight had only taken about five minutes, but all the time it had been going on, people had been running away from the shop and screaming. Keller had noticed them; she had simply filed them away in her mind as unimportant. There had been nothing she could do about them.\n Now, there were security officers closing in, and someone had undoubtedly called the police.\n She pushed with her arms again and managed to stand up.\n \"Nissa.\" It hurt her throat to speak. \"Where\u0027s the car?\"\n \"Right down there.\" Nissa pointed at the floor. \"Directly below us, parked outside the Mrs. Fields cookie store.\"\n \"Okay. Let\u0027s get Diana out.\" Keller looked at the young girl with the shimmering hair who as yet hadn\u0027t spoken a single word. \"Can you walk?\"\n Iliana stared at her. She didn\u0027t say anything. Stunned and frightened, Keller guessed. Well, a lot had happened in the last few minutes.\n \"I know this all seems bizarre to you, and you\u0027re probably wondering who we are.Ill explain everything. But right now, we have to get out of here. Okay?\"\n Iliana shrank a little, trembling.\n Not exactly a hero, Keller thought. Or quick on the uptake. Then she decided she was being unfair. This girl was the Witch Child; she undoubtedly had hidden strengths.\n \"Come on,\" Galen said to Iliana gently. \"She\u0027s right; it isn\u0027t safe here.\"\n Iliana looked up at him earnestly. She seemed about to agree. Then she gave a little shiver, shut her eyes, and fainted.\n Galen caught her as she fell.\n Keller stared.\n \"She\u0027s too pure to deal with this kind of stuff,\" Winnie said defensively. \"Violence and all. It\u0027s not the same as being chicken.\"\n It was at that exact moment that Keller could pinpoint her first real doubts about the new Wild Power. Galen looked down at the girl who lay in his arms like a broken lily. He looked at Keller.\n \"You take her; well surround you and cover you,\" Keller said, cutting him off. She knew her hair was in complete disarray, a wild cyclone of black around her. Her sleek jumpsuit was torn and stained, and she was clutching her right shoulder, which still throbbed in agony. But she must have looked fairly commanding, because Galen didn\u0027t say another word, just nodded and started toward the door.\n Nissa led the way in front of him. Winnie and Keller fell in behind. They were ready to fight, but when the security guards with walkie-talkies saw Nissa whirling her stick, they backed away. The ordinary people, curious onlookers attracted by all the noise, not only backed away but ran. Lots of them screamed.\n \"Go,\" Keller said. \"Fast. Go.\"\n They made it to Mrs. Fields without anybody trying to stop them.\n A girl with a red apron flattened herself against a wall as they thrust their way behind the counter and into the sanctum full of industrial-sized ovens in the back. A gangly boy dropped a tray with a clang, and lumps of raw cookie dough scattered on the floor.\n And then they were bursting through the back entrance, and there was the car, a white limousine illegally parked at the curb. Nissa whipped out a key chain and pressed a button, and Keller heard the click of doors unlocking.\n \"Inside!\" she said to Galen. He got in. Winnie ran around the car to get in the other side. Nissa slid into the driver\u0027s seat. Keller ducked in last and snapped, \"Go!\" even as she slammed the door.\n Nissa floored it.\n The limousine shot forward like a dolphin-just as a security truck sped up from the rear. A police car appeared dead in front of them.\n Nissa was an excellent driver. The limo swerved with a squeal of tires and peeled out of another of the parking lot\u0027s exits. A second police car swung toward them as Nissa dodged traffic. This one had lights and sirens on. Nissa gunned the engine, and the limo surged forward again. A freeway on-ramp was ahead.\n \"Hang on,\" Nissa said briefly.\n They were passing the on-ramp-they were past it. No, they weren\u0027t. At the last possible second, the limo screamed into a ninety-degree turn. Everyone inside was thrown around. Keller clenched her teeth as her wounded arm hit the window. Then they were shooting up the on-ramp and onto the freeway.\n With a little patter, cat\u0027s paws of rain appeared on the windshield. Keller, leaning forward to look over Nissa\u0027s shoulder, was happy. With icy rain and the low, gray fog, they probably wouldn\u0027t be chased by helicopter. The big limousine roared past the few other cars on the road and Winnie sat looking out the rear window, murmuring a spell to confuse and delay any pursuit.\n \"We lost them,\" Nissa said. Keller sat back and let out her breath. For the first time since she\u0027d entered the mall, she allowed herself to relax minutely.\n We did it.\n At the same moment, Winnie turned. She pounded the backseat with a small, hard fist. \"We did it! Keller-we got the Wild Power! We...\" Her voice trailed off as she saw Keller\u0027s face. \"And, uh... I guess I disobeyed orders.\" Her pounding was self-conscious now; she ducked her strawberry-blond head. \"Um, I\u0027m sorry, Boss.\"\n \"You\u0027d better be,\" Keller said. She held Winnie\u0027s gaze a moment, then said, \"You could have gotten yourself killed, witch-and for absolutely no good reason.\"\n Winnie grimaced. \"I know. I lost it. I\u0027m sorry.\" But she smiled timidly at Keller afterward. Keller\u0027s team knew how to read her.\n \"Sorry, too, Boss,\" Nissa said from the front seat. She slanted a glance at Keller from her mink-colored eyes. \"I wasn\u0027t supposed to leave the car.\"\n \"But you thought we might need a little help,\" Keller said. She nodded, meeting Nissa\u0027s eyes in the mirror. \"I\u0027m glad you did.\"\n The faintest flush of pleasure colored Nissa\u0027s cheeks.\n Galen cleared his throat.\n \"Um, for the record, I\u0027m sorry, too. I didn\u0027t mean to charge in like that in the middle of your operation.\"\n Keller looked at him.\n He was smiling slightly, hesitantly, the way Winnie had. A nice smile. The corner of his mouth naturally quirked upward, giving him a hint of mischief in all but the most serious moments. His green-gold eyes were apologetic but hopeful.\n \"Yeah, who are you, guy?\" Winnie was looking him up and down, her dark lashes twinkling. \"Did Circle Daybreak send you? I thought we were on this mission alone.\"\n \"You were. I belong to Circle Daybreak, but they didn\u0027t send me. I just-well, I was outside the shop, and I couldn\u0027t just stand there...\" His voice died. The smile died, too. \"You\u0027re really mad, aren\u0027t you?\"\n he said to Keller.\n \"Mad?\" She took a slow breath. \"I\u0027m furious.\"\n He blinked. \"I don\u0027t-\"\n \"You stopped me. I could have killed him!\"\n His gold-green eyes opened in shock and something like remembered pain. \"He was killing you.\"\n \"I know that,\" Keller snarled. \"It doesn\u0027t matter\n what happens to me. What matters is that now he\u0027s free. Don\u0027t you understand what he is?\"\n Winfrith was looking sober. \"I don\u0027t know. But he hit me with something powerful. Pure energy like what I use, but about a hundred times stronger.\"\n \"He\u0027s a dragon,\" Keller said. She saw Nissa\u0027s shoulders stiffen, but Winnie just shook her head, bewildered. \"A kind of shapeshifter that hasn\u0027t been around for about thirty thousand years.\"\n \"He can turn into a dragon?\"\n Keller didn\u0027t smile. \"No, of course not. Don\u0027t be silly. I don\u0027t know what he can do-but a dragon is what he is. Inside.\" Winnie suddenly looked queasy as this hit home. Keller turned back to Galen.\n \"And that\u0027s what you let loose on the world. It was the only chance to kill him-nobody will be able to take him by surprise like that again. Which means that everything he does after this is going to be your fault.\"\n Galen shut his eyes, looking dizzy. \"I\u0027m sorry. But when I saw you-I couldn\u0027t let you die....\"\n \"I\u0027m expendable. I don\u0027t know who you are, but I\u0027m willing to bet you\u0027re expendable. The only one here who isn\u0027t expendable is her.\" Keller jerked a thumb at Iliana, who lay in a pool of pale silver-gold hair on the seat beside Galen. \"And if you think that dragon isn\u0027t going to come back and try to get her again, you\u0027re crazy. I\u0027d have died happy knowing that I\u0027d gotten rid of him.\"\n Galen\u0027s eyes were open again, and Keller saw a flicker in them at the \"don\u0027t know who you are.\"\n But at the end, he said quietly, \"I\u0027m expendable. And I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t think\"\n \"That\u0027s right! You didn\u0027t! And now the whole world is going to suffer.\"\n Galen shut up and sat back.\n And Keller felt odd. She wasn\u0027t sorry for slapping him down, she told herself. He deserved it.\n But his face was so pale now, and his expression was so bleak. As if he\u0027d not only understood everything she\u0027d said but expanded on it in his own mind. And the look of hurt in his eyes was almost insupportable.\n Good, Keller told herself. But then she remembered the moment she\u0027d spent inside his mind. It had been a sunlit place, warm and open, without dark corners or shadowed crevasses. Now that would be gone forever. There was going to be a huge black fissure in it, full of horror and shame. A mark he would carry for the rest of his life.\n Well, welcome to the real world, Keller thought, and her throat tightened and hurt. She stared out the window angrily.\n \"See, it\u0027s really important that we keep Iliana safe,\" Winfrith was saying quietly to Galen. He didn\u0027t ask why, and Keller had noticed before that he hadn\u0027t asked why Iliana wasn\u0027t expendable. But Winnie went on telling him anyway. \"She\u0027s a Wild Power. You know about those?\"\n \"Who doesn\u0027t these days?\" He said it almost in a whisper.\n \"Well, most humans, for one thing. But she\u0027s not just a Wild Power; she\u0027s the Witch Child. Somebody we witches have been expecting for centuries.\n The prophecies say she\u0027s going to unite the shape-shifters and the witches. She\u0027s going to marry the son of the First House of the shapeshifters. And then the two races will be united, and all the shapeshifters will join Circle Daybreak, and well be able to hold off the end of the world at the millennium.\" Winnie finished out of breath. Then she cocked her strawberry-blond head. \"You don\u0027t seem surprised. Who are you, guy? You didn\u0027t really say before.\"\n \"Me?\" He was still looking into the distance. \"I\u0027m nobody, compared to you people.\" Then he gave a little wry smile that didn\u0027t reach his eyes. \"I\u0027m expendable.\"\n Nissa caught Keller\u0027s eye in the rearview mirror, looking concerned. Keller just shrugged. Sure, Winnie was telling this expendable guy a lot. But it didn\u0027t matter. He wasn\u0027t on the enemy side; and anyway, the enemy knew everything Winnie was saying. They had identified Iliana as the third Wild Power; the dragon proved that. They wouldn\u0027t have sent him if they hadn\u0027t been sure.\n But still, it was time to get rid of this interfering boy. They certainly couldn\u0027t take him to the safe house where they were taking Iliana.\n \"Nobody tailing us?\" Keller said.\n Nissa shook her head. \"We lost them all miles ago.\"\n \"You\u0027re sure?\"\n \"Dead certain.\"\n \"Okay. Take any exit, and we\u0027ll drop him off.\" She turned to Galen. \"I hope you can find your way home.\"\n \u0027I want to go with you.\"\n \"Sorry. We have important things to do.\" Keller didn\u0027t need to add, And you\u0027re not part of them. \"Look.\" Galen took a deep breath. His pale face was strained and exhausted, as if he\u0027d somehow lost three days\u0027 sleep since he\u0027d gotten into the limo. And there was something close to desperation in his eyes. \"I need to go with you. I need to help, to try and make up for what I did. I need to make it right.\"\n \"You can\u0027t.\" Keller said it even more brusquely than she meant to. \"You\u0027re not trained, and you\u0027re not involved in this. You\u0027re no good.\"\n He gave her a look. It didn\u0027t disagree with anything she\u0027d said, but somehow, for just an instant, it made her feel small. His greeny-gold eyes were just the opposite of the dragon\u0027s opaque ones. Keller could see for miles in them, endless light-filled fathoms, and it was all despair. A sorrow so great that it shook her. She knew it must be costing him a lot to show her that, to hold himself so open and vulnerable. But he kept looking at her steadily.\n \"You don\u0027t understand,\" he said quietly. I have to help you. I have to try, at least. I know I\u0027m not in your class as a fighter. But I...\" He hesitated. \"I didn\u0027t want to say this-\"\n At that moment, Iliana groaned and sat up.\n Or tried to. She didn\u0027t make it all the way. She put a hand to her head and started to fall off the seat. Galen steadied her, putting an arm around her to keep her propped up.\n \"Are you all right?\" Keller asked. She leaned forward, trying to get a look at the girl\u0027s face. Winnie was leaning forward, too, her expression eager.\n \"How\u0027re you feeling? You\u0027re not really hurt, are you? You just fainted from the shock.\"\n Diana looked around the limousine. She seemed utterly confused and disoriented.\n Keller was struck again by the girl\u0027s unearthly beauty. This close, she looked like a flower, or maybe a girl made from flowers. She had peach-blossom skin and hazy iris-colored eyes. Her hair was like corn silk, fine and shimmering even in this dim light. Her hands were small and graceful, fingers half curled like flower petals.\n \"It\u0027s such an honor to meet you,\" Winnie said, and her voice turned formal as she uttered the traditional greeting of the witches. \"Unity, Daughter of Hellewise. I\u0027m Winfrith Arlin.\" She dimpled. \"But it\u0027s really \u0027Arm-of-Lightning.\u0027 My family\u0027s an old one, almost as old as yours.\"\n Diana stared at her. Then she stared at the back of Nissa\u0027s mink-colored head. Then her eyes slid to Keller.\n Then she sucked in a deep breath and started screaming. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-witchlight-night-world-9/page-3.html","bookId":2082,"book":{"id":2082,"title":"Night World : Witchlight (Night World #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Witchlight (Night World Book 9) \n Keller is a black panther.
