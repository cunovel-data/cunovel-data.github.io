{"id":89000,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"They were all on their feet by now. Keller\u0027s early warning system was screaming hysterically. \"I can\u0027t stand it anymore,\" Diana hissed. \"What\u0027s going on?\" Just then, Nissa said in a quenched voice, \"All right, we will. Yes. \"Bye.\" She carefully replaced the handset. Then she turned very slowly to face the others. Or not to face them exactly. She was looking down at the floor in an unfocused way that scared Keller to death. \"Well, what is it?\" Keller growled. Nissa opened her mouth and raised her eyes to look at Winnie. Then she looked down again. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"Winnie, I don\u0027t know how to say this.\" She swallowed and then straightened, speaking formally. \"The Crone of all the Witches is dead.\" Winnie\u0027s eyes went huge, and her hands flew to her throat. \"Grandma Harman!\" \"Yes.\" \"But how?\" Nissa spoke carefully. \"It happened yesterday in Las Vegas. She was outside her shop, right there on a city street, in broad daylight. She was attacked... by three shapeshifters.\" Keller stood and listened to her pounding heart. Winnie breathed, \"No. That\u0027s not possible.\" \"A couple of wolves and a tiger. A real tiger, Keller, not any smaller cat. There were human witnesses who saw it. It\u0027s being reported as some bizarre escape from a private zoo.\" Keller stood rigid. Control, control, she thought. We don\u0027t have time for grieving; we\u0027ve got to figure out what this means. But she couldn\u0027t help thinking about Grandma Harman\u0027s good old face. Not a beautiful face, not a young face, but a good one, with intelligence and humor in the keen gray eyes. A face with a thousand wrinkles-and a story to go with each one. How would Circle Daybreak ever get along without her? The oldest witch in the world, the oldest Hearth-Woman. Winnie put both hands to her face and began to cry. The others stood silently. Keller didn\u0027t know what to do. She was so bad at these emotional things, but nobody else was stepping forward. Nissa was even less good at dealing with emotion, and right now her cool face was sympathetic and sad but distant. Iliana looked on the verge of tears herself, but uncertain. Galen was staring emptily across the room with something like despair. Keller awkwardly put an arm around Winnie. \"Come on, sit down. Do you want some tea? She wouldn\u0027t like you to cry.\" All pretty stupid things to say. But Winnie buried her strawberry-blond head against Keller\u0027s chest, sobbing. \"Why? Why did they kill her? It isn\u0027t right.\" Nissa shifted uneasily. \"Paulie said something about that, too. He said we should turn on CNN.\" Keller set her teeth. \"Where\u0027s the remote?\" she said, trying not to sound rough. Iliana picked it up and punched in a channel. An anchorwoman was speaking, but for a second Keller couldn\u0027t take in what she was saying. All she could see were the words on the screen: \"CNN SPECIAL REPORT: ANIMAL PANIC.\" And the footage, rough video from somebody\u0027s camcorder. It showed an unbelievable scene. An ordinary city street, with skyscrapers in the background-and in the foreground ordinary-looking people all mixed up with... shapes. Tawny shapes. About the same size she was in panther form, and sinuous. They were on top of people. Four of them... no, five. Mountain lions. They were killing the humans. A woman was screaming, flailing at an animal that had her arm in its mouth to the elbow. A man was trying to pull another lion off a little boy. Then something with a white-tipped muzzle ran directly at the camera. It jumped. There was a gasping scream and for an instant a glimpse of a wide-open mouth filled with two-inch teeth. Then the video turned to static. \"-that was the scene at the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles today. We now go to Ron Hennessy, live outside the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce...\" Keller stood frozen, her fists clenched in helpless fury. \"It\u0027s happening everywhere,\" Nissa said quietly from behind her. \"That\u0027s what Paulie said. Every major city in the U.S. is being attacked. A white rhino killed two people in Miami. In Chicago, a pack of timber wolves killed an armed police officer.\" \"Shapeshifters,\" Keller whispered. \"Yes. Killing humans openly. They may even be transforming openly. Paulie said that some people claimed to see those Chicago wolves change. She took a deep breath and spoke slowly. \"Keller, the time of chaos at the end of the millennium... it\u0027s happening now. They can\u0027t cover this up with a \"private zoo\" story. This is it-the beginning of the time when humans find out about the Night World.\" Diana looked bewildered. \"But why would shapeshifters start attacking humans? And why would they kill Grandma Harman?\" Keller shook her head. She was rapidly approaching numbness. She glanced at Galen and saw that he felt exactly the same. Then there was a choked sound beside her. \"That\u0027s the question-why,\" Winnie said in a thick voice. Usually, with her elfin features and mop of curls, she looked younger than her age. But right now, the skin on her face was drawn tight, and her birdlike bones made her look almost like an old woman. She turned on Keller and Galen, and her eyes were burning. \"Not just why they\u0027re doing it, why they\u0027re being allowed to do it. Where\u0027s the First House while all this is going on? Why aren\u0027t they monitoring their own people? Is it because they agree with what\u0027s happening?\" The last words were snapped out with a vicious-ness that Keller had never heard in Winfrith before. Galen opened his mouth, then he shook his head. \"Winnie, I don\u0027t think-\" \"You don\u0027t think! You don\u0027t know? What are your parents doing? Are you saying you don\u0027t know that?\" \"Winnie-\" \"They killed our oldest leader. Our wise woman. You know, some people would take that as a declaration of war.\" Keller felt stricken and at the same time furious at her own helplessness. She was in charge here; she should be heading Winnie off. But she was a shapeshifter like Galen. And along with the ability to transform and the exquisitely tuned senses, they both shared something unique to their race. The guilt of the shapeshifters. The terrible guilt that went back to the ancient days and was part of the very fabric of Kellers mind. No shapeshifter could forget it or escape it, and nobody who wasn\u0027t a shapeshifter could ever understand. The guilt was what held Galen standing there while Winnie yelled at him, and held Keller unable to interrupt. Winnie was right in front of Galen now, her eyes blazing, her body crackling with latent energy like a small but fiery orange comet. \"Who woke that dragon up, anyway?\" she demanded. \"How do we know the shapeshifters aren\u0027t up to their old tricks? Maybe this time they\u0027re going to wipe the witches out completely-\" \"Stop it!\" It was Hiana. She planted herself in front of Winnie, small but earnest, a little ice maiden to combat the witch\u0027s fire. Her nose was pink and swollen, and she was still wearing those teddy bear slippers, but to Keller she somehow looked valiant and magnificent. \"Stop hurting each other,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t understand any of this, but I know that you\u0027re not going to get anywhere if you fight. And I know you don\u0027t want to fight.\" All at once, she flung her arms around Winnie. \"I know how you feel-it\u0027s so awful. I felt the same way when Grandma Mary died, my mom\u0027s mother. All I could think of was that it was just so unfair.\" Winfrith hesitated, standing stiffly in Diana\u0027s embrace. Then, slowly, she lifted her own arms to hold Iliana back. \"We need her,\" she whispered. I know. And you feel mad at the people who killed her. But it\u0027s not Galen\u0027s fault. Galen would never hurt anybody.\" It was said with absolute conviction. Hiana wasn\u0027t even looking at Galen. She was stating a fact that she felt was common knowledge. But at the same time, now that she was off her guard, her expression was tender and almost shining. Yes, that\u0027s love, all right, Keller thought. And it\u0027s good. Very slowly, Winnie said, \u0027I know Galen wouldn\u0027t. But the shapeshifters--\" \"Maybe,\" Galen said, \"we should talk about that\" If Winnie\u0027s face was pinched, his was set in steel. His eyes were so dark that Keller couldn\u0027t distinguish the color. \"Maybe we should talk about the shapeshifters,\" he said. He nodded toward the kitchen table, which was still strewn with the parchments. \"About their history and about the dragons.\" He looked at Diana. \"If there\u0027s any chance of-of a promise ceremony between us, it\u0027s stuff you ought to know.\" Iliana looked startled. \"He\u0027s right,\" Nissa said in her calm voice. \"After all, that\u0027s what we were doing to start with. It\u0027s all tied together.\" Keller\u0027s whole body was tight. This was something that she very much didn\u0027t want to talk about But she refused to give in to her own weakness. With a tremendous effort, she managed to say steadily, \"All right. The whole story.\" \"It started back in the days humans were still living in caves,\" Galen said when they were all sitting down at the kitchen table again. His voice was so bleak and controlled that it didn\u0027t even sound like Galen. \"The shapeshifters ruled then, and they were brutal. In some places, they were just the totem spirits who demanded human sacrifice, but in others...\" He searched through the parchments, selected one. \"This is a picture of a breeding pen, with humans in it. They treated humans exactly the way humans treat cattle, breeding them for their hearts and livers. And the more human flesh they ate, the stronger they got.\" Iliana looked down at the parchment scrap, and her hand abruptly clenched on a tissue. Winnie listened silently, her pointed face stern. \"They were stronger than anyone,\" Galen said. \"Humans were like flies to them. The witches were more trouble, but the dragons could beat them.\" Iliana looked up. \"What about the vampires?\" \"There weren\u0027t any yet,\" Galen said quietly. \"The first one was Maya Hearth-Woman, the sister of Hellewise Hearth-Woman. She made herself into a vampire when she was looking for immortality. But the dragons were naturally immortal, and they were the undisputed rulers of the planet. And they had about as much pity for others as a 7. rex has.\" \"But all the shapeshifters weren\u0027t like that, were they?\" Iliana asked. \"There were other kinds besides the dragons, right?\" \"They were all bad,\" Keller said simply. \"My ancestors--the big felines-were pretty awful. But the bears and the wolves did their share.\" \"But you\u0027re right, the dragons were the worst,\" Galen said to Iliana. \"And that\u0027s who my family is descended from. My last name, Drache, means \u0027dragon.\u0027 Of course, it was the weakest of the dragons that was my ancestor. The one the witches left awake because she was so young.\" He turned to Winnie. \"Maybe you\u0027d better tell that part. The witches know their own history best.\" Still looking severe, Winnie thumbed through the parchment scraps until she found one. \"Here,\" she said. \u0027It\u0027s a picture of the gathering of the witches. Hecate Witch-Queen organized it. She was Hellewise\u0027s mother. She got all the witches together, and they went after the shapeshifters. There was a big fight. A really big fight.\" Winnie selected another piece of scroll and pushed it toward Diana. Diana gasped. The parchment piece she was looking down at was almost solid red. \"It\u0027s fire,\" she said. \u0027It looks like-it looks like the whole world\u0027s on fire.\" Galen\u0027s voice was flat. \"That\u0027s what the dragons did. Geological records show that volcanoes all over the world erupted around then. The dragons did that. I don\u0027t know how; the magic\u0027s lost. But they figured that if they couldn\u0027t have the world, nobody else would, either.\" \"They tried to destroy the world,\" Keller said. \"And the rest of the shapeshifters helped.\" \u0027It almost worked, too,\" Winnie said. \"But the gathering of witches managed to win, and they buried all the dragons alive. I mean, they put them to sleep first, but then they buried them in the deepest places of the earth.\" She bit her lip and looked at Galen. \"Which probably wasn\u0027t very nice, either.\" \"What else could they do?\" Galen said quietly. \"They left the dragon princess alive-she was only three or four years old. They let her grow up, under their guidance. But the world was a scorched and barren place for a long time. And the shapeshifters have always been... the lowest of all the Night People.\" \"That\u0027s true,\" Nissa put in, her voice neither approving nor disapproving, simply making an observation. \"Most Night People consider shapeshifters second-class citizens. They try to keep them down. I think, underneath, that they\u0027re still afraid of them.\" \"And there\u0027s never been an alliance between the shapeshifters and the witches,\" Keller said. She looked directly at Diana. \"That\u0027s why the promise ceremony is so important. If the shapeshifters don\u0027t side with the witches, they\u0027re going to go with the vampires-\" She stopped abruptly and looked at Galen. He nodded. \"I was thinking the same thing.\" \"Those animal attacks,\" Keller said slowly. \u0027It sounds as if the shapeshifters are already making their decision. They\u0027re helping to bring about the time of chaos at the end of the millennium. They\u0027re letting the whole world know that they\u0027re siding with the vampires.\" There was a shocked silence. \"But how can they decide?\" Winnie began. \"That\u0027s just it,\" Nissa said. \"The question is, is it just the ordinary shapeshifters who\u0027re doing it, or is it official? In other words, has the First House already decided?\" Everyone looked at Galen. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll make any decision yet, at least not in public. As for what they\u0027re doing in private, I don\u0027t know.\" His voice was still flat; it made no excuses. He looked around the table, facing all of them. \"My parents are warriors. They don\u0027t belong to Circle Daybreak, and they don\u0027t like the witches. But they don\u0027t like the vampires, either. More than anything, they\u0027ll want to be on whichever side is going to win. And that depends on which side gets the Wild Powers.\" \"I think they want something else,\" Keller said. \"like?\" They want to know that the witches are treating them fairly and not just trying to use them. I mean, if they thought that Circle Daybreak had found the Witch Child but wasn\u0027t going to promise her to their heir, well, they wouldn\u0027t be happy. It\u0027s not just a matter of having a kinship bond with the witches. It\u0027s a matter of feeling they\u0027re being treated as equals.\" Nissa\u0027s light brown eyes narrowed, and she seemed almost to smile. \"I think you\u0027ve summed it up very well.\" \"So what it all comes down to,\" Keller said pointedly, \"is what happens on Saturday night. If there\u0027s a promise ceremony, it means the witches have found the Wild Power and that they\u0027re willing to tie her to the shapeshifters. If not...\" She let the sentence trail off and looked at Hiana. There, she thought. I\u0027ve put it so plainly and simply, you can\u0027t deny it now. And you can\u0027t help but see what\u0027s at stake. Diana\u0027s eyes were like faraway violet storm clouds. Keller couldn\u0027t tell what she was thinking. Maybe that the situation couldn\u0027t be denied but that she herself wasn\u0027t involved. Winnie took a deep breath. \"Galen.\" Her face was still drawn and unhappy, but the burning anger in her eyes was gone. She met Galen\u0027s gaze directly. Tm sorry,\" she said. \"I shouldn\u0027t have said those things before. I know you\u0027re on our side. And I\u0027m not like those people who don\u0027t trust the shapeshifters.\" Galen smiled at her faintly, but his eyes were serious. \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe you shouldn\u0027t trust us. There are things in our blood-you can\u0027t get rid of the dragon completely.\" It was strange. At that moment, his eyes looked not only dark but almost red to Keller. Exactly the opposite of their usual golden-green. It was as if a light were smoldering somewhere deep inside them. Then Winnie abruptly extended her hand across the table. \"I know you,\" she said. \"And there\u0027s nothing bad in your blood. I won\u0027t mistrust you again.\" Galen hesitated one instant, then reached out with something like gratitude and took her hand. \"Thanks,\" he whispered. \"Hey, if I were the Witch Child, I\u0027d promise to you in a minute,\" Winnie said. Then she sniffled, but her smile was much more like the old Winnie\u0027s smile. Keller glanced at Iliana almost casually and was riveted by what she saw. The girl had changed again. Now she didn\u0027t look like a princess or an ice maiden but like a very young soldier about to go into battle. Or maybe a human sacrifice who could save her tribe by jumping into a volcano. Her hair seemed to shine, silvery and pale, and her eyes were deep, deep violet in her small face. Her slight shoulders were back, and her chin was determined. Slowly, staring at something invisible in the center of the table, Iliana stood up. As soon as the motion drew their attention, the others fell quiet. It was obvious to everyone that something important was happening. Iliana stood there, her hands clenched by her sides, her chest rising and falling with her breathing. Then she looked at Galen. Finally, she looked at Keller. Tm not the Witch Child any more than Winnie is. And I think you know that by now. But...\" She took a breath, steadied herself. Keller held her own breath. \"But if you want me to pretend to be, I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ll go to the promise ceremony with Galen-I mean, if hell do it with me.\" She gave a half-embarrassed glance at Galen, looking shy and almost apologetic. \"Will he ever!\" Winnie said enthusiastically. Keller could have kissed her. Galen himself didn\u0027t rise to the occasion properly at all; instead, he opened his mouth, looking uncertain. Fortunately, Iliana was going on. \"Then I\u0027ll go through with it. And maybe that will be enough for the shapeshifters to join with the witches, as long as they don\u0027t find out I\u0027m a fake.\" She looked unhappy. She was so adamant that for a moment Keller was shaken. Could it be she wasn\u0027t the Wild Power? But no. Keller knew she was. She just hasn\u0027t awakened her power yet. And if she continued to deny it, she never would. She said, \"Thank you, Iliana. You don\u0027t know how much, how many lives you\u0027re going to save. Thank you.\" Then the excitement got the better of her, and she took Iliana by the arm and gave her a sort of shaking squeeze of affection. \"You\u0027re a trooper!\" Winnie said, and hugged her hard. \"I knew you\u0027d come through all the time, I really did.\" Nissa smiled at her with genuine approval. Galen was smiling, too, although there was something in his eyes... \"There\u0027s just one thing,\" Iliana said a little bit breathlessly, rubbing her arm where Keller had gripped it. \"Ill do this. I said I would. But I have two conditions.\" Keller\u0027s excitement deflated. \"Conditions?\" \"You can have anything you want,\" Winnie said, blinking away happy tears. \"Cars, clothes, books...\" \"No, no, I don\u0027t want things,\" Diana said. \"What I mean is, I\u0027m doing this because I can\u0027t just stand around and not do anything when stuff like that is going on.\" She shivered. \"I have to do anything I can to help. But. I\u0027m still not the right person. So the first condition is that while I\u0027m pretending to be the Wild Power, you guys have somebody out looking for the real one.\" Keller said smoothly, \"I\u0027ll tell Circle Daybreak. They\u0027ll keep looking and checking other Harmans. They\u0027ll do it for as long as you want them to.\" They would, too. It was a small price to pay. \"And the other condition?\" Keller asked. \"I want to go to Jaime\u0027s party on Saturday.\" Instant uproar. Even Nissa was talking over people. Keller cut short her own exclamations and gestured for everybody to shut up. Then she looked Diana dead in the eye. \u0027It\u0027s impossible. And you know it\u0027s impossible. Unless you\u0027ve found a way to be in two places at once.\" \"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" Diana said. That small, determined chin was tight. \"I mean before the promise ceremony thing. I want to go just for an hour or two. Because she\u0027s one of my very best friends, and she\u0027s gotten attacked twice because of me.\" \"So what? You\u0027re already making it up to her. You\u0027re saving her life and her twin brother\u0027s life and her parents\u0027 lives-\" \"No, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m faking being a Wild Power when I know it isn\u0027t true. I\u0027m acting a lie.\" There were tears in Diana\u0027s eyes now. \"But I\u0027m not going to hurt Jaime\u0027s feelings, and I\u0027m not going to break my promise to her. And that\u0027s that. So if you want me to go through with your little charade, I\u0027ll do it, but I want to go to the party first.\" There was a silence. Well, she\u0027s stubborn, I\u0027ll give her that, Keller thought. Once she decides on something, she absolutely won\u0027t be budged on it. I guess that will be helpful when the Wild Powers fight the darkness someday. But right now, it was simply infuriating. Keller drew a very long breath and said, \"Okay.\" Winnie and Nissa looked at her sharply. They hadn\u0027t expected her to give in so fast, and they were undoubtedly wondering if their boss had some trick up her sleeve.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-witchlight-night-world-9/page-12.html","bookId":2082,"book":{"id":2082,"title":"Night World : Witchlight (Night World #9)","description":"Storyline: Witchlight (Night World Book 9) Keller is a black panther.
