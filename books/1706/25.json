And for a rope? Some sort of cloth perhaps amp;She looked around the interior. Maybe she could tear the fabric off the seats? Or cut it off in strips? That might work. In this way, she kept her spirits up. She kept herself moving forward. Even if her chance of success was small, there was still a chance. A chance. She focused on that. Where was Kenner? What would he do when he heard the radio message? He probably had, already. Would he come back to Weddell? Almost certainly. And he would look for that guy, the one they thought of as Bolden. But Sarah was pretty sure that guy had disappeared. And with his disappearance, her hopes for rescue. The crystal of her watch was smashed. She didn\u0027t know how long she had been down there, but she noticed that it was darker than before. The gap above her was not as bright. Either the weather on the surface was changing, or the sun was low on the horizon. That would mean she had been down there for two or three hours already. She was aware of a stiffening in her bodynot just from the fall, but also, she realized, because she was cold. The cab had lost its heat. It occurred to her that perhaps she could start the motor, and get heat going. It was worth a try. She flicked on the headlights, and one of them worked, glaring off the ice wall. So there was still electricity from the battery. She turned the key. The generator made a grinding sound. The engine did not kick on. And she heard a voice yell, \"Hey!\" Sarah looked up, toward the surface. She saw nothing but the gap and the strip of gray sky beyond. \"Hey!\" She squinted. Was somebody really up there? She yelled back: \"Hey! I\u0027m down here!\" \"I know where you are,\" the voice said. And then she realized the voice was coming from below her. She looked down, into the depths of the crevasse. \"Peter?\" she said. \"I\u0027m fucking freezing,\" he said. His voice floated up from the darkness. \"Are you hurt?\" \"No, I don\u0027t think so. I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t move. I\u0027m wedged in some kind of cleft or something.\" \"How far down are you?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t turn my head to look up. I\u0027m stuck, Sarah.\" His voice trembled. He sounded frightened. \"Can you move at all?\" she said. \"Just one arm.\" \"Can you see anything?\" \"Ice. I see a blue wall. It\u0027s about two feet away.\" Sarah was straddling the open door, peering down into the crevasse, straining to see. It was very dark down there. But it seemed as if the crevasse narrowed quickly, farther down. If so, he might not be that far beneath her. \"Peter. Move your arm. Can you move your arm?\" \"Yes.\" \"Wave it.\" \"I am.\" She didn\u0027t see anything. Just darkness. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Stop.\" \"Did you see me?\" \"No.\" \"Shit.\" He coughed. \"It\u0027s really cold, Sarah.\" \"I know. Hang on.\" She had to find a way to see down into the cleft. She looked under the dashboard, near where the fire extinguisher was clipped to the car wall. If there was a fire extinguisher, there was probably a flashlight there, too. They would be sure to have a flashlight amp;someplace. Not under the dashboard. Maybe the glove compartment. She opened it, shoved her hand in, feeling in the darkness. Crunching paper. Her fingers closed around a thick cylinder. She brought it out. It was a flashlight. She flicked it on. It worked. She shone it down into the depths of the crevasse. \"I see that,\" Peter said. \"I see the light.\" \"Good,\" she said. \"Now swing your arm again.\" \"I am.\" \"Now?\" \"I\u0027m doing it now.\" She stared. \"Peter, I don\u0027t seewait a minute.\" She did see himjust the tips of his fingers in their red gloves, protruding briefly beyond the tractor treads, and the ice below. \"Peter.\" \"What.\" \"You\u0027re very near me,\" she said. \"Just five or six feet below me.\" \"Great. Can you get me out?\" \"I could, if I had a rope.\" \"There\u0027s no rope?\" he said. \"No. I opened the supply chest. There\u0027s nothing at all.\" \"But it\u0027s not in the supply chest,\" he said. \"It\u0027s under the seat.\" \"What?\" \"Yeah, I saw it. The ropes and stuff are under the passenger seat.\" She looked. The seat was on a steel base anchored firmly to the floor of the snowtrack. There were no doors or compartments in the base. It was difficult to maneuver around the seat to see, but she was sure: no doors. On a sudden impulse, she lifted up the seat cushion, and saw a compartment beneath it. The light of her flashlight revealed ropes, hooks, snow axes, crampons amp; \"Got it,\" she said. \"You were right. It\u0027s all here.\" \"Whew,\" he said. She brought the equipment out carefully, making sure none of it fell through the open door. Already her fingers were growing numb, and she felt clumsy as she held a fifty-foot length of nylon rope with a three-pronged ice hook at one end. \"Peter,\" she said. \"If I lower a rope, can you grab it?\" \"Maybe. I think so.\" \"Can you hold the rope tight, so I can pull you out?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I just have the one arm free. The other one\u0027s pinned under me.\" \"Are you strong enough to hold the rope with one arm?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think so. I mean, if I got my body partway out, and lost my grip amp;\" His voice broke off. He sounded on the verge of tears. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t worry.\" \"I\u0027m trapped, Sarah!\" \"No, you\u0027re not.\" \"I am, I\u0027m trapped, I\u0027m fucking trapped!\" Now there was panic. \"I\u0027m going to die here!\" \"Peter. Stop.\" She was coiling the rope around her waist as she spoke. \"It\u0027s going to be all right. I have a plan.\" \"What plan?\" \"I\u0027m going to lower an ice hook on the rope,\" she said. \"Can you hook it onto something? Like your belt?\" \"Not my belt amp;No. I\u0027m wedged in here, Sarah. I can\u0027t move. I can\u0027t reach my belt.\" She was trying to visualize his situation. He must be wedged in some sort of cleft in the ice. It was frightening just to imagine it. No wonder he was scared. \"Peter,\" she said, \"can you hook it onto anything?\" \"I\u0027ll try.\" \"Okay, here it comes,\" she said, lowering the rope. The hook disappeared into the darkness. \"Do you see it?\" \"I see it.\" \"Can you reach it?\" \"No.\" \"Okay, I\u0027ll swing it toward you.\" She turned her wrist gently, starting the rope in a lateral swing. The hook vanished out of sight, then swung back, then out of sight again. \"I can\u0027t amp;keep doing it, Sarah.\" \"I am.\" \"I can\u0027t get it, Sarah.\" \"Keep trying.\" \"It has to be lower.\" \"Okay. How much lower?\" \"About a foot.\" \"Okay.\" She lowered it a foot. \"How\u0027s that?\" \"Good, now swing it.\" She did. She heard him grunting, but each time the hook swung back into view. \"I can\u0027t do it, Sarah.\" \"Yes you can. Keep trying.\" \"I can\u0027t. My fingers are too cold.\" \"Keep trying,\" she said. \"Here it is again.\" \"I can\u0027t, Sarah, I can\u0027t amp;Hey!\" \"What?\" \"I almost got it.\" Looking down, she saw the hook spinning when it came back into view. He\u0027d touched it. \"Once more,\" she said. \"You\u0027ll do it, Peter.\" \"I\u0027m trying, it\u0027s just I have so littleI got it, Sarah. I got it!\" She gave a long sigh of relief. He was coughing in the darkness. She waited. \"Okay,\" he said. \"I got it hooked on my jacket.\" \"Where?\" \"Right on the front. Just on my chest.\" She was visualizing that if the hook ripped free, it would tear right into his chin. \"No, Peter. Hook it on the armpit.\" \"I can\u0027t, unless you pull me out a couple of feet.\" \"Okay. Say when.\" He coughed. \"Listen, Sarah. Are you strong enough to pull me out?\" She had avoided thinking about that. She just assumed that somehow she could. Of course she didn\u0027t know how hard he was wedged in, but amp;\"Yes,\" she said. \"I can do it.\" \"Are you sure? I weigh a hundred and sixty.\" He coughed again. \"Maybe a little more. Maybe ten more.\" \"I\u0027ve got you tied off on the steering wheel.\" \"Okay, but amp;don\u0027t drop me.\" \"I won\u0027t drop you, Peter.\" There was a pause. \"How much do you weigh?\" \"Peter, you never ask a lady that question. Especially in LA.\" \"We\u0027re not in LA.\" \"I don\u0027t know how much I weigh,\" she said. Of course she knew exactly. She weighed a hundred and thirty-seven pounds. He weighed over thirty pounds more than that. \"But I know I can pull you up,\" she said. \"Are you ready?\" \"Shit.\" \"Peter, are you ready or not?\" \"Yeah. Go.\" She drew the rope tight, then crouched down, planting her feet firmly on either side of the open door. She felt like a sumo wrestler at the start of a match. But she knew her legs were much stronger than her arms. This was the only way she could do it. She took a deep breath. \"Ready?\" she said. \"I guess.\" Sarah began to stand upright, her legs burning with effort. The rope stretched taut, then moved upwardslowly at first, just a few inches. But it was moving. It was moving. \"Okay, stop. Stop!\" \"What?\" \"Stop!\" \"Okay.\" She was in mid-crouch. \"But I can\u0027t hold this for long.\" \"Don\u0027t hold it at all. Let it out. Slowly. About three feet.\" She realized that she must have already pulled him part of the way out of the cleft. His voice sounded better, much less frightened, though he was coughing almost continuously. \"Peter?\" \"Minute. I\u0027m hooking it on my belt.\" \"Okay amp;\" \"I can see up now,\" he said. \"I can see the tread. The tread is about six feet above my head.\" \"Okay.\" \"But when you pull me up, the rope\u0027s going to rub on the edge of the tread.\" \"It\u0027ll be okay,\" she said. \"And I\u0027ll be hanging right over the, uh amp;\" \"I won\u0027t let you go, Peter.\" He coughed for a while. She waited. He said, \"Tell me when you\u0027re ready.\" \"I\u0027m ready.\" \"Then let\u0027s get this over with,\" he said, \"before I get scared.\" There was only one bad moment. She had pulled him up about four feet, and he came free of the cleft, and she suddenly took the full weight of his body. It shocked her; the rope slid three feet down. He howled. \"Sar-ah!\" She gripped the rope, stopped it. \"Sorry.\" \"Fuck!\" \"Sorry.\" She adjusted to the added weight, started pulling again. She was groaning with the effort but it was not long before she saw his hand appear above the tread, and he gripped it, and began to haul himself over. Then two hands, and his head appeared. That shocked her, too. His face was covered in thick blood, his hair matted red. But he was smiling. \"Keep pulling, sister.\" \"I am, Peter. I am.\" Only after he finally had scrambled into the cab did Sarah sink to the floor. Her legs began to shake violently. Her body trembled all over. Evans, lying on his side, coughing and wheezing beside her, hardly noticed. Eventually the trembling passed. She found the first-aid kit and began to clean his face up. \"It\u0027s only a superficial cut,\" she said, \"but you\u0027ll need stitches.\" \"If we ever get out of here amp;\" \"We\u0027ll get out, all right.\" \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re confident.\" He looked out the window at the ice above. \"You done much ice climbing?\" She shook her head. \"But I\u0027ve done plenty of rock climbing. How different can it be?\" \"More slippery? And what happens when we get up there?\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"We have no idea where to go.\" \"We\u0027ll follow the guy\u0027s snowtracks.\" \"If they\u0027re still there. If they haven\u0027t blown away. And you know it\u0027s at least seven or eight miles to Weddell.\" \"Peter,\" she said. \"If a storm comes up, maybe we\u0027re better off down here.\" \"I\u0027m not staying here,\" she said. \"If I\u0027m going to die, I\u0027ll die in daylight.\" The actual climb up the crevasse wall was not so bad, once Sarah got used to the way she had to kick her boots with the crampons, and how hard she had to swing the axe to make it bite into the ice. It took her only seven or eight minutes to cover the distance, and clamber onto the surface. The surface looked exactly the same as before. The same dim sunlight, the same gray horizon that blended with the ground. The same gray, featureless world. She helped Evans up. His cut was bleeding again, and his mask was red, frozen stiff against his face. \"Shit it\u0027s cold,\" he said. \"Which way, do you think?\" Sarah was looking at the sun. It was low on the horizon, but was it sinking, or rising? And which direction did the sun indicate, anyway, when you were at the South Pole? She frowned: She couldn\u0027t work it out, and she didn\u0027t dare make a mistake. \"We\u0027ll follow the tracks,\" she said at last. She took off her crampons and started walking. She had to admit, Peter was right about one thing: It was much colder here on the surface. After half an hour, the wind came up, blowing strongly; they had to lean into it as they trudged forward. Worse, the snow began to blow across the ground beneath their feet. Which meant \"We\u0027re losing the tracks,\" Evans said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-25.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
