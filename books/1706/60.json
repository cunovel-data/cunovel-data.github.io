They scrambled up the hillside another twenty yards. Kenner was carrying Jennifer\u0027s bleeding body. By now she had lost consciousness. Evans and Sarah were helping Morton, who was moving with great difficulty. Finally, Evans picked Morton up and carried him piggyback style.\\n\\n \"Glad you lost some weight,\" Evans said.\\n\\n Morton, not speaking, just patted him on the shoulder.\\n\\n Evans staggered up the hill.\\n\\n The next wave came in.\\n\\n When it receded, their jeeps had vanished. The spot where they had been parked was littered with the trunks of uprooted trees. They stared, very tired. They argued: Was that the fourth wave or the fifth? No one could remember. They decided it must have been the fourth.\\n\\n \"What do we do?\" Sarah said to Kenner.\\n\\n \"We climb.\"\\n\\n Eight minutes later, the next wave came in. It was smaller than the one before. Evans was too tired to do anything but stare at it. Kenner was trying to stop Jennifer\u0027s bleeding, but her skin was an ugly pale gray and her lips were blue. Down at the beach, there was no sign of human activity at all. The tents were gone. The generators were gone. There was nothing but piled-up debris, tree branches, pieces of wood, seaweed, foam.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" Sarah said.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Someone is shouting.\"\\n\\n They looked across to the opposite side of the bay. Someone was waving to them.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Sanjong,\" Kenner said. \"Son of a bitch.\" He grinned. \"I hope he\u0027s smart enough to stay where he is. It\u0027ll take him a couple of hours to get across the debris. Let\u0027s go see if our helicopter is still there or if the wave took it. Then we\u0027ll go pick him up.\"\\n\\n Chapter 85\\n\\n PACIFIC BASIN\\n\\n FRIDAY, OCTOBER 15\\n\\n 5:04 P.M.\\n\\n Eight thousand miles to the east, it was the middle of the night in Golden, Colorado, when the computers of the National Earthquake Information Center registered an atypical seismic disturbance originating from the Pacific basin, just north of the Solomon Islands, and measuring 6.3 Richter. That was a strong quake, but not unusually strong. The peculiar characteristics of the disturbance led the computer to categorize it as an \"anomalous event,\" a fairly common designation for seismic events in that part of the world, where three tectonic plates met in strange overlapping patterns.\\n\\n The NEIC computers assessed the earthquake as lacking the relatively slow movement associated with tsunamis, and thus did not classify it as a \"tsunami-generating event.\" However, in the South Pacific, this designation was being reexamined, following the devastating New Guinea earthquake of 1998the single most destructive tsunami of the centurywhich also did not have the classic slow tsunami profile. Thus, as a precaution, the computers flagged the earthquake to the sensors of the MORN, the Mid-Ocean Relay Network, operating out of Hilo, Hawaii.\\n\\n Six hours later, mid-ocean buoys detected a nine-inch rise in the ocean level consistent with a tsunami wave train. Because of the great depth of the mid-ocean, tsunamis often raised the sea level only a few inches. On this particular evening, ships in the area felt nothing at all as the big wave front passed beneath them. Nevertheless, the buoys felt it, and triggered an alarm.\\n\\n It was the middle of the night in Hawaii when the computers pinged and the screens came up. The network manager, Joe Ohiri, had been dozing. He got up, poured himself a cup of coffee and inspected the data. It was clearly a tsunami profile, though one that appeared to be losing force in its ocean passage. Hawaii was of course in its path, but this wave would strike the south shore of the islands, a relative rarity. Ohiri made a quick wave-force calculation, was unimpressed with the results, and so sent a routine notification to civil defense units on all the inhabited islands. It began \"This is an information message amp;\" and finished with the usual boilerplate about the alert being based on preliminary information. Ohiri knew that nobody would pay much attention to it. Ohiri also notified the West Coast and Alaska Warning Centers, because the wave train was due to strike the coast in early mid-morning of the following day.\\n\\n Five hours later, the DART buoys off the coast of California and Alaska detected the passage of a tsunami train, now further weakened. Computers calculated the velocity and wave force and recommended no action. This meant that the message went out to the local stations as a tsunami information bulletin, not an alert:\\n\\n BASED ON LOCATION AND MAGNITUDE THE EARTHQUAKE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO GENERATE A TSUNAMI DAMAGING TO CALIFORNIAOREGONWASHINGTONBRITISH COLUMBIA OR ALASKA. SOME AREAS OREGONWASHINGTONBRITISH COLUMBIA OR ALASKA. SOME AREAS MAY EXPERIENCE SMALL SEA LEVEL CHANGES.\\n\\n Kenner, who was monitoring the messages on his computer, shook his head when he saw this. \"Nick Drake is not going to be a happy man today.\" It was Kenner\u0027s hypothesis that they had needed the cavitation generators to extend the effect of the underwater detonations, and to create the relatively long-lasting landslide that would have produced a truly powerful ocean-crossing tsunami. That had been thwarted.\\n\\n Ninety minutes later, the much-weakened tsunami train struck the beaches of California. It consisted of a set of five waves averaging six feet in height that excited surfers briefly, but passed unnoticed by everyone else.\\n\\n Belatedly, Kenner was notified that the FBI had been attempting to reach him for the past twelve hours. It turned out that V. Allen Willy had vacated his beach house at two A.M. local time. This was less than an hour after the events in Resolution Bay had taken place, and more than ten hours prior to the tsunami notification.\\n\\n Kenner suspected that Willy had gotten cold feet, and had been unwilling to wait. But it was an important and telling mistake. Kenner called the agent and started proceedings to subpoena Willy\u0027s phone records.\\n\\n None of them was allowed to leave the island for the next three days. There were formalities, forms, interrogations. There were problems with emergency care for Morton\u0027s collapsed lung and Jennifer\u0027s massive blood loss. Morton wanted to be taken to Sydney for surgery, but he was not allowed to leave because he had been reported as a missing person in America. Although he complained bitterly about witch doctors, a very good surgeon trained in Melbourne took care of his lung in Gareda Town. But Jennifer had not been able to wait for that surgeon; she had needed three transfusions during five hours of surgery to remove the bullets in her upper body, and then she was on a respirator, near death for the next forty-eight hours. But at the end of the second day she opened her eyes, pulled off her oxygen mask, and said to Evans, sitting at her bedside, \"Stop looking so gloomy. I\u0027m here, for God\u0027s sake.\" Her voice was weak, but she was smiling.\\n\\n Then there were problems about their contact with the rebels. There were problems about the fact that one of their party had disappeared, the famous actor Ted Bradley. They all told the story of what had happened to Bradley, but there was no way to corroborate it. So the police made them tell it again.\\n\\n And suddenly, abruptly, unaccountably, they were allowed to leave. Their papers were in order. Their passports were returned. There was no difficulty. They could leave whenever they wanted.\\n\\n Evans slept most of the way to Honolulu. After the plane refueled and took off again, he sat up and talked to Morton and the others. Morton was explaining what had happened on the night of his car crash.\\n\\n \"There was obviously a problem with Nick and what he was doing with his money. NERF was not doing good things. Nick was very angrydangerously angry. He threatened me, and I took him at his word. I had established the link between his organization and ELF, and he was threatened, to put it mildly. Kenner and I thought he would try to kill me. Well, he did try. With that girl at the coffee shop, that morning in Beverly Hills.\"\\n\\n \"Oh yes.\" Evans remembered. \"But how did you stage that car crash? It was so incredibly dangerous\"\\n\\n \"What, do you think I\u0027m crazy?\" Morton said. \"I never crashed.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"I kept right on driving, that night.\"\\n\\n \"But.\" Evans fell silent, shaking his head. \"I don\u0027t get it.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you do,\" Sarah said. \"Because I let it slip to you, by accident. Before George called me and told me to keep my mouth shut about it.\"\\n\\n It came back to him then. The conversation from days ago. He hadn\u0027t paid much attention at the time. Sarah had said:\\n\\n He told me to buy a new Ferrari from a guy in Monterey and have it shipped to San Francisco.\\n\\n When Evans expressed surprise that George was buying another Ferrari:\\n\\n I know. How many Ferraris can one man use? And this one doesn\u0027t seem up to his usual standard. From the e-mail pictures it looks kind of beat up.\\n\\n And then she said:\\n\\n The Ferrari he bought is a 1972 365 GTS Daytona Spyder. He already has one, Peter. It\u0027s like he doesn\u0027t know amp; \"Oh, I knew all right,\" Morton said. \"What a waste of money. The car was a piece of crap. And then I had to fly a couple of Hollywood prop guys up to Sonoma to beat the hell out of it and make it look like a crash. Then they flat-bedded it out that night, set it on the road, fired up the smoke pots amp;\"\\n\\n \"And you drove right past a wreck that was already in place,\" Evans said.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Morton said, nodding. \"Drove right around the corner. Pulled off the road, climbed up the hill, and watched you guys.\"\\n\\n \"You son of a bitch.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Morton said, \"but we needed real emotion to distract the police from the problems.\"\\n\\n \"What problems?\"\\n\\n \"Ice-cold engine block, for one,\" Kenner said. \"That engine hadn\u0027t run for days. One of the cops noticed it was cold while the car was being put on the truck. He came back and asked you the time of the accident, all of that. I was concerned they would figure it out.\"\\n\\n \"But they didn\u0027t,\" Morton said.\\n\\n \"No. They knew something was wrong. But I don\u0027t think they ever guessed identical Ferraris.\"\\n\\n \"No one in his right mind,\" Morton said, \"would intentionally destroy a 1972 365 GTS. Even a crappy one.\"\\n\\n Morton was smiling, but Evans was angry. \"Somebody could have told me\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Kenner said. \"We needed you to work Drake. Like the cell phone.\"\\n\\n \"What about it?\"\\n\\n \"The cell phone was a very low-quality bug. We needed Drake to suspect that you were part of the investigation. We needed him pressured.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it worked. That\u0027s why I got poisoned in my apartment, isn\u0027t it?\" Evans said. \"You guys were willing to take a lot of risks with my life.\"\\n\\n \"It turned out all right,\" Kenner said.\\n\\n \"You did this car crash to pressure Drake?\"\\n\\n \"And to get me free,\" Morton said. \"I needed to go down to the Solomons and find out what they were doing. I knew Nick would save the best for last. Although if they had been able to modify that hurricanethat was the third stunt they plannedso that it hit Miami, that would have been spectacular.\"\\n\\n \"Fuck you, George,\" Evans said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry it had to be this way,\" Kenner said.\\n\\n \"And fuck you, too.\"\\n\\n Then Evans got up and went to the front of the plane. Sarah was sitting alone. He was so angry he refused to speak to her. He spent the next hour staring out the window. Finally, she began talking quietly to him, and at the end of half an hour, they embraced.\\n\\n Evans slept for a while, restless, his body sore. He couldn\u0027t find a comfortable position to rest. Intermittently, he would wake up, groggy. One time he thought he heard Kenner talking to Sarah.\\n\\n Let\u0027s remember where we live, Kenner was saying. We live on the third planet from a medium-size sun. Our planet is five billion years old, and it has been changing constantly all during that time. The Earth is now on its third atmosphere.\\n\\n The first atmosphere was helium and hydrogen. It dissipated early on, because the planet was so hot. Then, as the planet cooled, volcanic eruptions produced a second atmosphere of steam and carbon dioxide. Later the water vapor condensed, forming the oceans that cover most of the planet. Then, around three billion years ago, some bacteria evolved to consume carbon dioxide and excrete a highly toxic gas, oxygen. Other bacteria released nitrogen. The atmospheric concentration of these gases slowly increased. Organisms that could not adapt died out.\\n\\n Meanwhile, the planet\u0027s land masses, floating on huge tectonic plates, eventually came together in a configuration that interfered with the circulation of ocean currents. It began to get cold for the first time. The first ice appeared two billion years ago.\\n\\n And for the last seven hundred thousand years, our planet has been in a geological ice age, characterized by advancing and retreating glacial ice. No one is entirely sure why, but ice now covers the planet every hundred thousand years, with smaller advances every twenty thousand or so. The last advance was twenty thousand years ago, so we\u0027re due for the next one.\\n\\n And even today, after five billion years, our planet remains amazingly active. We have five hundred volcanoes, and an eruption every two weeks. Earthquakes are continuous: a million and a half a year, a moderate Richter 5 quake every six hours, a big earthquake every ten days. Tsunamis race across the Pacific Ocean every three months.\\n\\n Our atmosphere is as violent as the land beneath it. At any moment there are one thousand five hundred electrical storms across the planet. Eleven lightning bolts strike the ground each second. A tornado tears across the surface every six hours. And every four days, a giant cyclonic storm, hundreds of miles in diameter, spins over the ocean and wreaks havoc on the land.\\n\\n The nasty little apes that call themselves human beings can do nothing except run and hide. For these same apes to imagine they can stabilize this atmosphere is arrogant beyond belief. They can\u0027t control the climate. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-60.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
