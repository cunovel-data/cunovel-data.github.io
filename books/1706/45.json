To complete his dominance he stuck his tongue down her throat.\\n\\n Then there was a blinding flash of painin his neck, his headand he must have lost consciousness for a moment. Because the next thing he knew he was sitting on the floor of the limousine, gasping and watching blood drip all over his shirt. Ted was not sure how he had gotten there. He was not sure why he was bleeding or why his head was throbbing. Then he realized that his tongue was bleeding.\\n\\n He looked up at her. She crossed her legs coolly, giving him a glimpse up her skirt, but he didn\u0027t care. He was resentful. \"You bit my tongue!\"\\n\\n \"No, asshole, you bit your own tongue.\"\\n\\n \"You assaulted me!\"\\n\\n She raised an eyebrow.\\n\\n \"You did! You assaulted me!\" He looked down. \"Jesus, this was a new shirt, too. From Maxfield\u0027s.\"\\n\\n She stared at him.\\n\\n \"You assaulted me,\" he repeated.\\n\\n \"So sue me.\"\\n\\n \"I think I will.\"\\n\\n \"Better consult your lawyer first.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n She nodded her head toward the front of the car. \"You\u0027re forgetting the driver.\"\\n\\n \"What about him?\"\\n\\n \"He saw it all.\"\\n\\n \"So what? You encouraged me,\" he said, hissing. \"You were being seductive. Any guy knows the signs.\"\\n\\n \"Apparently you didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Hostile ballbreaker?\" He turned and took the vodka bottle from the rack. He needed it to rinse out his mouth. He poured himself a glass, and looked back.\\n\\n She was reading the talking points. She held the paper in her hands. He lunged for it. \"That\u0027s not yours.\"\\n\\n She was quick, holding the paper away from him. She raised her other hand, edge on, like a chopping knife.\\n\\n \"Care to try your luck again, Ted?\"\\n\\n \"Fuck you,\" he said, and took a big gulp of the vodka. His tongue was on fire. What a bitch, he thought. What a goddamned bitch. Well, she\u0027d be looking for a new job tomorrow. He\u0027d see to that. This bimbo lawyer couldn\u0027t fuck around with Ted Bradley and get away with it.\\n\\n Standing beneath the crashed Ferrari, Evans endured another ten minutes of grilling by the plainclothesmen who encircled him. Fundamentally, the story didn\u0027t make sense to him.\\n\\n Evans said, \"George was a good driver. If all these changes were made to the car, wouldn\u0027t he have noticed something was wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps. But not if he was drinking heavily.\"\\n\\n \"Well, he was drinking, that\u0027s for sure.\"\\n\\n \"And who got him the drinks, Mr. Evans?\"\\n\\n \"George got his own drinks.\"\\n\\n \"The waiter at the banquet said you were pushing drinks at Morton.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not true. I was trying to limit his drinking.\"\\n\\n Abruptly, they changed course. \"Who worked on the Ferrari, Mr. Evans?\"\\n\\n \"I have no idea.\"\\n\\n \"We know you rented a private garage outside Sonoma on Route 54. It was fairly quiet and out of the way. Any person or persons who worked on the car would have been able to come and go as they wished, without being seen. Why would you choose such a garage?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t choose it.\"\\n\\n \"Your name is on the lease.\"\\n\\n \"How was the lease arranged?\"\\n\\n \"By phone.\"\\n\\n \"Who paid for it?\"\\n\\n \"It was paid in cash.\"\\n\\n \"By whom?\"\\n\\n \"Delivered by messenger.\"\\n\\n \"You have my signature on anything? Fingerprints?\"\\n\\n \"No. Just your name.\"\\n\\n Evans shrugged. \"Then I\u0027m sorry, but I don\u0027t know anything about this. It\u0027s well known that I\u0027m George Morton\u0027s attorney. Anybody could have used my name. If anything was done to this car, it was done without my knowledge.\"\\n\\n He was thinking that they should have been asking Sarah about all this, but then, if they were good at their jobs, they\u0027d already have talked to her.\\n\\n And sure enough, she appeared from around the corner, talking on a cell phone and nodding to Kenner.\\n\\n That was when Kenner stepped forward. \"Okay, gentlemen. Unless you have further questions, I\u0027ll take Mr. Evans into custody on my recognizance. I don\u0027t believe he is a flight risk. He will be safe enough with me.\"\\n\\n The cops grumbled, but in the end they agreed. Kenner handed out his card, and then he headed back toward the entrance, his arm firmly on Evans\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n Sarah followed some distance behind. The cops stayed with the Ferrari.\\n\\n As they neared the door, Kenner said, \"Sorry about all that. But the police didn\u0027t tell you everything. The fact is, they photographed the car from various angles and fed the shots into a computer that simulates crashes. And the computer-generated simulation didn\u0027t match the photos of the actual crash.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know you could do that.\"\\n\\n \"Oh yes. Everybody uses computer models these days. They are de rigueur for the modern organization. Armed with their computer simulation, the police went back to the wreck itself, where they now decided that it had been monkeyed with. They never imagined this during their previous examinations of the wreck, but now they do. Clear example of using a computer simulation to alter your version of reality. They trusted the simulation and not the data from the ground.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh.\"\\n\\n \"And of course their simulation was optimized for the most common vehicle types on American roads. The computer had no ability to model the behavior of a forty-year-old, limited-production Italian racing car. They ran the simulation anyway.\"\\n\\n Evans said, \"But what\u0027s all this about a garage in Sonoma?\"\\n\\n Kenner shrugged. \"You don\u0027t know. Sarah doesn\u0027t know. Nobody can even verify if the car was ever there. But the garage was rentedI\u0027d guess by George himself. Though we\u0027ll never know for sure.\"\\n\\n Back outside, Evans threw open the door to his limo and climbed in. He was astonished to see Ted Bradley covered in blood, all down his chin and shirt front.\\n\\n \"What happened?\"\\n\\n \"He slipped,\" Jennifer said. \"And hurt himself.\"\\n\\n Chapter 65\\n\\n TO LOS ANGELES\\n\\n TUESDAY, OCTOBER 12\\n\\n 10:31 P.M.\\n\\n On the flight back, Sarah Jones was overcome with confused feelings. First of all, she was profoundly distressed by the fact that George Morton\u0027s body had been recovered; in some part of her mind, she had been hoping against hope that he would turn up alive. Then there was the question of Peter Evans. Just as she was starting to like himstarting to see a side of him that was not wimpy, but rather tough and resilient in his own bumbling wayjust as she was beginning, in fact, to have the first stirrings of feelings toward the man who had saved her life, suddenly there was this new woman, Jennifer somebody, and Peter was obviously taken with her.\\n\\n And in addition, there was the arrival of Ted Bradley. Sarah had no illusions about Ted; she had seen him in action at innumerable NERF gatherings, and she had even once allowed him to work his charms on hershe was a sucker for actorsbut at the last moment decided he reminded her too much of her ex. What was it about actors, anyway? They were so engaging, so personal in their approach, so intense in their feelings. It was hard to realize that they were just self-absorbed people who would do anything to get you to like them.\\n\\n At least, Ted was.\\n\\n And how had he been injured? Bitten his own tongue? Sarah had the feeling it had to do with this Jennifer. Undoubtedly, Ted had made a pass at her. The woman was pretty enough in a street-smart kind of way; dark hair, toughish face, compact body, muscular but skinny. A typical speeded-up New York typein every way Sarah\u0027s opposite.\\n\\n And Peter Evans was fawning over her.\\n\\n Fawning.\\n\\n It was sort of disgusting, but she had to admit she was disappointed personally as well. Just as she had started to like him. She sighed.\\n\\n As for Bradley, he was talking to Kenner about environmental issues, showing off his extensive knowledge. And Kenner was looking at Bradley the way a python looks at a rat.\\n\\n \"So,\" Kenner said, \"global warming represents a threat to the world?\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely,\" Bradley said. \"A threat to the whole world.\"\\n\\n \"What sort of threat are we talking about?\"\\n\\n \"Crop failures, spreading deserts, new diseases, species extinction, all the glaciers melting, Kilimanjaro, sea-level rise, extreme weather, tornadoes, hurricanes, El Ni—Åo events\"\\n\\n \"That sounds extremely serious,\" Kenner said.\\n\\n \"It is,\" Bradley said. \"It really is.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure of your facts?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"You can back your claims with references to the scientific literature?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I can\u0027t personally, but scientists can.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, scientific studies do not support your claims. For example, crop failureif anything, increased carbon dioxide stimulates plant growth. There is some evidence that this is happening. And the most recent satellite studies show the Sahara has shrunk since 1980.* As for new diseasesnot true. The rate of emergence of new diseases has not changed since 1960.\"\\n\\n \"But we\u0027ll have diseases like malaria coming back to the US and Europe.\"\\n\\n \"Not according to malaria experts.\"* Bradley snorted and folded his hands across his chest.\\n\\n \"Species extinction hasn\u0027t been demonstrated either. In the 1970s, Norman Myers predicted a million species would be extinct by the year2000. Paul Ehrlich predicted that fifty percent of all species would be extinct by the year 2000. But those were just opinions. Do you know what we call opinion in the absence of evidence? We call it prejudice. Do you know how many species there are on the planet?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Neither does anybody else. Estimates range from three million to one hundred million. Quite a range, wouldn\u0027t you say? Nobody really has any idea.\"!\\n\\n \"Your point being?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hard to know how many species are becoming extinct if you don\u0027t know how many there are in the first place. How could you tell if you were robbed if you didn\u0027t know how much money you had in your wallet to begin with? And fifteen thousand new species are described every year. By the way, do you know what the known rate of species extinction is?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because there is no known rate. Do you know how they measure numbers of species and species extinctions? Some poor bastard marks off a hectare or an acre of land and then tries to count all the bugs and animals and plants inside it. Then he comes back in ten years and counts again. But maybe the bugs have moved to an adjacent acre in the meantime. Anyway, can you imagine trying to count all the bugs in an acre of land?\"\\n\\n \"It would be difficult.\"\\n\\n \"To put it mildly. And very inaccurate,\" Kenner said, \"which is the point. Now, about all the glaciers meltingnot true. Some are, some aren\u0027t.\"* \"Nearly all of them are.\"\\n\\n Kenner smiled thinly. \"How many glaciers are we talking about?\"\\n\\n \"Dozens.\"\\n\\n \"How many glaciers are there in the world, Ted?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Guess.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, uh, two hundred.\"\\n\\n \"There are more than that in California. There are one hundred sixty thousand glaciers in the world, Ted. About sixty-seven thousand have been inventoried, but only a few have been studied with any care. There is mass balance data extending five years or more for only seventy-nine glaciers in the entire world. So, how can you say they\u0027re all melting? Nobody knows whether they are or not.\"!\\n\\n \"Kilimanjaro is melting.\"\\n\\n \"Why is that?\"\\n\\n \"Global warming.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, Kilimanjaro has been rapidly melting since the 1800slong before global warming. The loss of the glacier has been a topic of scholarly concern for over a hundred years. And it has always been something of a mystery because, as you know, Kilimanjaro is an equatorial volcano, so it exists in a warm region. Satellite measurements of that region show no warming trend at the altitude of the Kilimanjaro glacier. So why is it melting?\"\\n\\n Sulking: \"You tell me.\"\\n\\n \"Because of deforestation, Ted. The rain forest at the base of the mountain has been cut down, so the air blowing upward is no longer moist. Experts think that if the forest is replanted the glacier will grow again.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s bullshit.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll give you the journal references.* Now thensea-level rise? Was that the next threat you mentioned?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Sea level is indeed rising.\"\\n\\n \"Ah-hah!\"\\n\\n \"As it has been for the last six thousand years, ever since the start of the Holocene. Sea level has been rising at the rate of ten to twenty centimetersthat\u0027s four to eight inchesevery hundred years.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s rising faster now.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, not.\"\\n\\n \"Satellites prove it.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, they don\u0027t.\"!\\n\\n \"Computer models prove it\u0027s rising faster.\"¬ß \"Computer models can\u0027t prove anything, Ted. A prediction can\u0027t ever be proofit hasn\u0027t happened yet. And computer models have failed to accurately predict the last ten or fifteen years. But if you want to believe in them anyway, there is no arguing with faith. Now, what was next on your list? Extreme weatheragain, not true. Numerous studies show there is no increase.\"* \"Look,\" Ted said, \"you may enjoy putting me down, but the fact is, lots of people think there will be more extreme weather, including more hurricanes and tornadoes and cyclones, in the future.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, indeed, lots of people think so. But scientific studies do not bear them out. That\u0027s why we do science, Ted, to see if our opinions can be verified in the real world, or whether we are just having fantasies.\"\\n\\n \"All these hurricanes are not fantasies.\"\\n\\n Kenner sighed. He flipped open his laptop.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"One moment,\" Kenner said. \"Let me bring it up.\"\\n\\n US Hurricane Strikes by Decade 19002004 \"Here is the actual data, Ted,\" Kenner said. \"US hurricane strikes over the last hundred years are clearly not increasing. And similarly, extreme weather is not more frequent globally. The data simply do not agree with you. Now, you also mentioned El Ni—Åo events.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-45.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
