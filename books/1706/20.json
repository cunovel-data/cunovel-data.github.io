He was again rubbing his hands. \"All right,\" he said. \"All the two boys have to say is that they want to talk to a lawyer, and they seem to know one. Imagine that. But we\u0027ll know more in a few hours.\" He turned to Peter. \"So: mystery solved? Concerning the Buddha?\" Evans glared at him. \"No.\" \"Really? It\u0027s quite straightforward.\" \"Why don\u0027t you just tell us,\" Evans said. \"Reach your right hand out to the end table,\" Kenner said. Evans put his hand out. There were five remote controls on the table. \"Yes?\" he said. \"And?\" \"What are they for?\" \"It\u0027s a media room,\" Evans said. \"I think we\u0027ve established that.\" \"Yes,\" Kenner said. \"But what are they for?\" \"Obviously,\" Evans said, \"to control the television, the satellite, the DVD, the VHS, all that.\" \"Which one does which?\" Kenner said. Evans stared at the table. And suddenly he got it. \"Oh my God,\" he said. \"You\u0027re absolutely right.\" He was flipping them over, one after another. \"This one\u0027s the flat panel amp;DVD amp;satellite amp;high def amp;\" He stopped. There was one more. \"Looks like there are two DVD controllers.\" The second one was stubby and black and had all the usual buttons, but it was slightly lighter than the other. Evans pulled open the battery compartment. Only one battery was there. In place of the other was a tightly rolled piece of paper. \"Bingo,\" he said. He took the paper out. All that matters is not remote from where the Buddha sits. That\u0027s what George had said. Which meant that this paper was all that matters. Carefully, Evans unrolled the tiny sheet and pressed it flat on the coffee table with the heel of his hand, smoothing out the wrinkles. And then he stared. The paper contained nothing but columns of numbers and words: 662262 3982293 24FXE 62262 82293 TERROR 882320 4898432 12FXE 82232 54393 SNAKE 774548 9080799 02FXE 67533 43433 LAUGHER 482320 5898432 22FXE 72232 04393 SCORPION ALT 662262 3982293 24FXE 62262 82293 TERROR 382320 4898432 12FXE 82232 54393 SEVER 244548 9080799 02FXE 67533 43433 CONCH 482320 5898432 22FXE 72232 04393 SCORPION ALT 662262 3982293 24FXE 62262 82293 TERROR 382320 4898432 12FXE 82232 54393 BUZZARD 444548 7080799 02FXE 67533 43433 OLD MAN 482320 5898432 22FXE 72232 04393 SCORPION ALT 662262 3982293 24FXE 62262 82293 TERROR 382320 4898432 12FXE 82232 54393 BLACK MESA 344548 9080799 02FXE 67533 43433 SNARL 482320 5898432 22FXE 72232 04393 SCORPION Evans said, \"Is this what everybody\u0027s after?\" Sarah was looking at the paper over his shoulder. \"I don\u0027t get it. What does it mean?\" Evans passed the paper to Kenner. He hardly glanced at it before he said, \"No wonder they were so desperate to get this back.\" \"You know what it is?\" \"There\u0027s no doubt about what it is,\" Kenner said, handing the paper to Sanjong. \"It\u0027s a list of geographic locations.\" \"Locations? Where?\" \"We\u0027ll have to calculate that,\" Sanjong said. \"They\u0027re recorded in UTM, which may mean the listing was intended for pilots.\" Kenner saw the blank looks on the others\u0027 faces. \"The world is a globe,\" he said, \"and maps are flat. Therefore all maps are projections of a sphere onto a flat surface. One projection is the Universal Transverse Mercator grid, which divides the globe into six-degree grids. It was originally a military projection, but some pilot charts use it.\" Evans said, \"So these numbers are latitude and longitude in a different form?\" \"Correct. A military form.\" Kenner ran his finger down the page. \"It appears to be several alternate sets of four locations. But in every instance the first and last locations are the same. For whatever reason amp;\" He frowned, and stared off into space. \"Is that bad?\" Sarah said. \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Kenner said. \"But it might be, yes.\" He looked at Sanjong. Sanjong nodded gravely. \"What is today?\" he said. \"Tuesday.\" \"Then amp;time is very short.\" Kenner said, \"Sarah, we\u0027re going to need George\u0027s plane. How many pilots does he have?\" \"Two, usually.\" \"We\u0027ll need at least four. How soon can you get them?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Where do you want to go?\" she said. \"Chile.\" \"Chile! And leave when?\" \"As soon as possible. Not later than midnight.\" \"It\u0027ll take me some time to arrange\" \"Then get started now,\" Kenner said. \"Time is short, Sarah. Very short.\" Evans watched Sarah go out of the room. He turned back to Kenner. \"Okay,\" he said. \"I give up. What\u0027s in Chile?\" \"A suitable airfield, I presume. With adequate jet fuel.\" Kenner snapped his fingers. \"Good point, Peter. Sarah,\" he called into the next room, \"what kind of a plane is it?\" \"G-five!\" she called back. Kenner turned to Sanjong Thapa, who had taken out a small handheld computer and was tapping away at it. \"Are you connected to Akamai?\" \"Yes.\" \"Was I right?\" \"I\u0027ve only checked the first location so far,\" Sanjong said. \"But yes. We need to go to Chile.\" \"Then Terror is Terror?\" Kenner said. \"I think so, yes.\" Evans looked from one man to the other. \"Terror is Terror?\" he said, puzzled. \"That\u0027s right,\" Kenner said. Sanjong said, \"You know, Peter\u0027s got a point.\" Evans said, \"Are you guys ever going to tell me what\u0027s going on?\" \"Yes,\" Kenner said. \"But first, you have your passport?\" \"I always carry it.\" \"Good man.\" Kenner turned back to Sanjong. \"What point?\" \"It\u0027s UTM, Professor. It\u0027s a six-degree grid.\" \"Of course!\" Kenner said, snapping his fingers again. \"What\u0027s the matter with me?\" \"I give up,\" Evans said. \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\" But Kenner didn\u0027t answer; he now seemed almost hyperactive, his fingers twitching nervously as he picked up the remote control from the table beside Peter and peered at it closely, turning it in the light. Finally, he spoke. \"A six-degree grid,\" Kenner said, \"means that these locations are only accurate to a thousand meters. Roughly half a mile. That\u0027s simply not good enough.\" \"Why? How accurate should it be?\" \"Three meters,\" Sanjong said. \"About ten feet.\" \"Assuming they are using PPS,\" Kenner said, still squinting at the remote control. \"In which case amp;Ah. I thought so. It\u0027s the oldest trick in the book.\" He pulled the entire back of the remote off, exposing the circuit board. He lifted that away to reveal a second folded sheet of paper. It was thin, hardly more than tissue paper. It contained rows of numbers and symbols. -2147483640,8,0*x %БgKА__^O#_QА__cБ\"aaaaaЪ?_ ____________________ яяя__е -2147483640,8,0%h [email protected] /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */ __cБ\"aaaaaЪ?яяяя____________________ яяя__ -2147483640,8,0г\u0027\"^$PNА_N__йxFА__cБ-aaaaaЪї____________________ яяя__В -2147483640,8,0уW\"1/4_OА т q_lMА__cБ\"aaaaaЪ?яяяя____________________ яяя__Ґ -2147483640,8,0%0ж/С_LАшш_8_ФPА__cБ\"aaaaaЪї?____________________ яяя__ -2147483640,8,0*x %БgKА__^O#_QА__cБ\"aaaaaЪ?_ ____________________ яяя__е -2147483640,8,0%h [email protected] /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */ __cБ\"aaaaaЪ?яяяя____________________ яяя__ -2147483640,8,0уW\"1/4_OА т q_lMА__cБ\"aaaaaЪ?яяяя____________________ яяя__Ґ -2147483640,8,0л{\"l_-OАг \"d,LА__cБ-aaaaaЪї____________________ яя -2147483640,8,0%0ж/С_LАшш_8_ФPА__cБ\"aaaaaЪї?____________________ яяя__ -2147483640,8,0*x %БgKА__^O#_QА__cБ\"aaaaaЪ?_ ____________________ яяя__е -2147483640,8,0%h [email protected] /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */ __cБ\"aaaaaЪ?яяяя____________________ яяя__ -2147483640,8,0уW\"1/4_OА т q_lMА__cБ\"aaaaaЪ?яяяя____________________ яяя__Ґ -2147483640,8,0л{\"l_-OАг \"d,LА__cБ-aaaaaЪї____________________ яяя -2147483640,8,0%0ж/С_LАшш_8_ФPА__cБ\"aaaaaЪ?____________________ яяя__ \"All right,\" Kenner said. \"This is more like it.\" \"And these are?\" Evans said. \"True coordinates. Presumably for the same locations.\" \"Terror is Terror?\" Evans said. He was starting to feel foolish. Kenner said, \"Yes. We\u0027re talking about Mount Terror, Peter. An inactive volcano. You have heard of it?\" \"No.\" \"Well, we\u0027re going there.\" \"Where is it?\" \"I thought you\u0027d have guessed that by now,\" Kenner said. \"It\u0027s in Antarctica, Peter.\" Chapter 29 II. TERROR TO PUNTA ARENAS TUESDAY, OCTOBER 5 9:44 P.M. Van Nuys Airport sank beneath them. The jet turned south, crossing the flat, glowing expanse of the Los Angeles Basin. The flight attendant brought Evans coffee. On the little screen, it said 6,204 miles to destination. Flying time was nearly twelve hours. The flight attendant asked them if they wanted dinner, and went off to prepare it. \"All right,\" Evans said. \"Three hours ago, I\u0027m coming to help Sarah deal with a robbery. Now I\u0027m flying to Antarctica. Isn\u0027t it time somebody told me what this is about?\" Kenner nodded. \"Have you heard of the Environmental Liberation Front? ELF?\" \"No,\" Evans said, shaking his head. \"Not me,\" Sarah said. \"It\u0027s an underground extremist group. Supposedly made up of ex-Greenpeace and Earth First! types who thought those organizations had gone soft. ELF engages in violence on behalf of environmental causes. They\u0027ve burned hotels in Colorado, houses on Long Island, spiked trees in Michigan, torched cars in California.\" Evans nodded. \"I read about them amp;. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies can\u0027t infiltrate them because the organization consists of separate cells that never communicate with one another.\" \"Yes,\" Kenner said. \"Supposedly. But cell phone conversations have been recorded. We\u0027ve known for some time that the group was going global, planning a series of major events around the world, starting a few days from now.\" \"What kind of events?\" Kenner shook his head. \"That, we don\u0027t know. But we have reason to think they\u0027ll be bigand destructive.\" Sarah said, \"What does this have to do with George Morton?\" \"Funding,\" Kenner said. \"If ELF is preparing actions around the world, they need a lot of money. The question is, where are they getting it?\" \"Are you saying George has funded an extremist group?\" \"Not intentionally. ELF is a criminal organization, but even so, radical groups like PETA fund them. Frankly, it\u0027s a disgrace. But the question became whether better-known environmental groups were funding them, too.\" \"Better-known groups? Like who?\" \"Any of them,\" Kenner said. \"Wait a minute,\" Sarah said. \"Are you suggesting that the Audubon Society and the Sierra Club fund terrorist groups?\" \"No,\" Kenner said. \"But I\u0027m telling you that nobody knows exactly what any of these groups do with their money. Because government oversight of foundations and charities is extraordinarily lax. They don\u0027t get audited. The books don\u0027t get inspected. Environmental groups in the US generate half a billion dollars a year. What they do with it is unsupervised.\" Evans frowned. \"And George knew this?\" \"When I met him,\" Kenner said, \"he was already worrying about NERF. What it was doing with its money. It dispenses forty-four million dollars a year.\" Evans said, \"You\u0027re not going to tell me that NERF\" \"Not directly,\" Kenner said. \"But NERF spends nearly sixty percent of its money on fund-raising. It can\u0027t admit that, of course. It\u0027d look bad. It gets around the numbers by contracting nearly all of its work to outside direct-mail advertisers and telephone solicitation groups. These groups have misleading names, like the International Wildlife Preservation Fundthat\u0027s an Omaha-based direct-mail organization, that in turn outsources the work to Costa Rica.\" \"You\u0027re kidding,\" Evans said. \"No. I am not. And last year the IWPF spent six hundred fifty thousand dollars to gather information on environmental issues, including three hundred thousand dollars to something called the Rainforest Action and Support Coalition, RASC. Which turns out to be a drop box in Elmira, New York. And an equal sum to Seismic Services in Calgary, another drop box.\" \"You mean amp;\" \"A drop box. A dead end. That was the true basis of the disagreement between Morton and Drake. Morton felt that Drake wasn\u0027t minding the store. That\u0027s why he wanted an external audit of the organization, and when Drake refused, Morton got really worried. Morton is on the NERF board; he has liability. So he hired a team of private investigators to investigate NERF.\" \"He did?\" Evans said. Kenner nodded. \"Two weeks ago.\" Evans turned to Sarah. \"Did you know this?\" She looked away, then back. \"He told me I couldn\u0027t tell anyone.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-20.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
