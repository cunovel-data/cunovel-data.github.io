Because although we imagine we live in different nationsFrance, Germany, Japan, the USin fact, we inhabit exactly the same state, the State of Fear. How has that been accomplished?\"\n Evans said nothing. He knew it wasn\u0027t necessary.\n \"Well, I shall tell you how,\" he said. \"In the old daysbefore your time, Petercitizens of the West believed their nation-states were dominated by something called the military-industrial complex. Eisenhower warned Americans against it in the 1960s, and after two world wars Europeans knew very well what it meant in their own countries. But the military-industrial complex is no longer the primary driver of society. In reality, for the last fifteen years we have been under the control of an entirely new complex, far more powerful and far more pervasive. I call it the politico-legal-media complex. The PLM. And it is dedicated to promoting fear in the populationunder the guise of promoting safety.\"\n \"Safety is important.\"\n \"Please. Western nations are fabulously safe. Yet people do not feel they are, because of the PLM. And the PLM is powerful and stable, precisely because it unites so many institutions of society. Politicians need fears to control the population. Lawyers need dangers to litigate, and make money. The media need scare stories to capture an audience. Together, these three estates are so compelling that they can go about their business even if the scare is totally groundless. If it has no basis in fact at all. For instance, consider silicon breast implants.\"\n Evans sighed, shaking his head. \"Breast implants?\"\n \"Yes. You will recall that breast implants were claimed to cause cancer and autoimmune diseases. Despite statistical evidence that this was not true, we saw high-profile news stories, high-profile lawsuits, high-profile political hearings. The manufacturer, Dow Corning, was hounded out of the business after paying $3.2 billion, and juries awarded huge cash payments to plaintiffs and their lawyers.\n \"Four years later, definitive epidemiological studies showed beyond a doubt that breast implants did not cause disease. But by then the crisis had already served its purpose, and the PLM had moved on, a ravenous machine seeking new fears, new terrors. I\u0027m telling you, this is the way modern society worksby the constant creation of fear. And there is no countervailing force. There is no system of checks and balances, no restraint on the perpetual promotion of fear after fear after fear amp;.\"\n \"Because we have freedom of speech, freedom of the press.\"\n \"That is the classic PLM answer. That\u0027s how they stay in business,\" Hoffman said. \"But think. If it is not all right to falsely shout Fire!\u0027 in a crowded theater, why is it all right to shout Cancer!\u0027 in the pages of The New Yorker? When that statement is not true? We\u0027ve spent more than twenty-five billion dollars to clear up the phony power-line cancer claim.* So what?\u0027 you say. I can see it in your face. You\u0027re thinking, we\u0027re rich, we can afford it. It\u0027s only twenty-five billion dollars. But the fact is that twenty-five billion dollars is more than the total GDP of the poorest fifty nations of the world combined. Half the world\u0027s population lives on two dollars a day. So that twenty-five billion would be enough to support thirty-four million people for a year. Or we could have helped all the people dying of AIDS in Africa. Instead, we piss it away on a fantasy published by a magazine whose readers take it very seriously. Trust it. It is a stupendous waste of money. In another world, it would be a criminal waste. One could easily imagine another Nuremberg trialthis time for the relentless squandering of Western wealth on trivialitiesand complete with pictures of the dead babies in Africa and Asia that result.\"\n He hardly paused for breath. \"At the very least, we are talking about a moral outrage. Thus we can expect our religious leaders and our great humanitarian figures to cry out against this waste and the needless deaths around the world that result. But do any religious leaders speak out? No. Quite the contrary, they join the chorus. They promote What Would Jesus Drive?\u0027 As if they have forgotten that what Jesus would drive is the false prophets and fearmongers out of the temple.\"\n He was getting quite heated now.\n \"We are talking about a situation that is profoundly immoral. It is disgusting, if truth be told. The PLM callously ignores the plight of the poorest and most desperate human beings on our planet in order to keep fat politicians in office, rich news anchors on the air, and conniving lawyers in Mercedes-Benz convertibles. Oh, and university professors in Volvos. Let\u0027s not forget them.\"\n \"How\u0027s that?\" Evans said. \"What does this have to do with university professors?\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s another discussion.\"\n \"Is there a short version?\" Evans said.\n \"Not really. That\u0027s why headlines aren\u0027t news, Peter. But I will try to be succinct,\" he said. \"The point is this: the world has changed in the last fifty years. We now live in the knowledge society, the information society, whatever you want to call it. And it has had enormous impact on our universities.\n \"Fifty years ago, if you wanted to lead what was then called the life of the mind,\u0027 meaning to be an intellectual, to live by your wits, you had to work in a university. The society at large had no place for you. A few newspaper reporters, a few magazine journalists could be considered as living by their wits, but that was about it. Universities attracted those who willingly gave up worldly goods to live a cloistered intellectual life, teaching timeless values to the younger generation. Intellectual work was the exclusive province of the university.\n \"But today, whole sectors of society live the life of the mind. Our entire economy is based on intellectual work, now. Thirty-six percent of workers are knowledge workers. That\u0027s more than are employed in manufacturing. And when professors decided they would no longer teach young people, but leave that task to their graduate students who knew much less than they did and spoke English poorlywhen that happened, the universities were thrown into crisis. What good were they anymore? They had lost their exclusive hold on the life of the mind. They no longer taught the young. Only so many theoretical texts on the semiotics of Foucault could be published in any single year. What was to become of our universities? What relevance did they have in the modern era?\"\n He stood up, as if energized by this question. Then abruptly, he sat down again.\n \"What happened,\" he continued, \"is the universities transformed themselves in the 1980s. Formerly bastions of intellectual freedom in a world of Babbittry, formerly the locus of sexual freedom and experimentation, they now became the most restrictive environments in modern society. Because they had a new role to play. They became the creators of new fears for the PLM. Universities today are factories of fear. They invent all the new terrors and all the new social anxieties. All the new restrictive codes. Words you can\u0027t say. Thoughts you can\u0027t think. They produce a steady stream of new anxieties, dangers, and social terrors to be used by politicians, lawyers, and reporters. Foods that are bad for you. Behaviors that are unacceptable. Can\u0027t smoke, can\u0027t swear, can\u0027t screw, can\u0027t think. These institutions have been stood on their heads in a generation. It is really quite extraordinary.\n \"The modern State of Fear could never exist without universities feeding it. There is a peculiar neo-Stalinist mode of thought that is required to support all this, and it can thrive only in a restrictive setting, behind closed doors, without due process. In our society, only universities have created thatso far. The notion that these institutions are liberal is a cruel joke. They are fascist to the core, I\u0027m telling you.\"\n He broke off and pointed down the walkway. \"Who is this fellow pushing toward us through the crowd? He looks oddly familiar.\"\n Evans said, \"That\u0027s Ted Bradley, the actor.\"\n \"Where have I seen him?\"\n \"He plays the president on television.\"\n \"Oh yes. Him.\"\n Ted came to a halt in front of them, panting. \"Peter,\" he said, \"I\u0027ve been looking everywhere for you. Is your cell phone on?\"\n \"No, because\"\n \"Sarah has been trying to reach you. She says it\u0027s important. We have to leave town right away. And bring your passport.\"\n Evans said, \"We? What does this have to do with you?\"\n \"I\u0027m coming with you,\" Ted said.\n As they started to walk away, Hoffman clutched at Evans\u0027s sleeve, holding him back. He had a new thought. \"We haven\u0027t talked about involution,\" he said.\n \"Professor\"\n \"It is the next step in the development of nation-states. Indeed it is already happening. You must see the irony. After all, twenty-five billion dollars and ten years later the same rich elitists who were terrified of power-line cancer are buying magnets to strap to their ankles or put on their mattressesimported Japanese magnets are the best, the most expensivein order to enjoy the healthful effects of magnetic fields. The same magnetic fieldsonly now they can\u0027t get enough of them!\"\n \"Professor,\" Evans said, \"I have to go.\"\n \"Why don\u0027t these people just lie back against a TV screen? Snuggle up to a kitchen appliance? All the things that terrified them before.\"\n \"We\u0027ll talk later,\" Evans said, pulling his arm away.\n \"They even sell magnets in the health magazines! Healthy living through magnetic fields! Insanity! No one remembers even a few years ago! George Orwell. No memory!\"\n \"Who is that guy?\" Bradley said, as they headed off. \"He seems a little wound up, doesn\u0027t he?\"\n Chapter 72\n SANTA MONICA\n WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13\n 10:33 A.M.\n \"The record of catastrophe is contained within the ice cores,\" the speaker said, droning on at the podium. He was Russian and spoke with a heavy accent. \"These ice cores from Greenland show that, in the last one hundred thousand years, there have been four abrupt climate change events. Some have occurred very quickly, in a few years. While the mechanisms by which these events occurred are still being studied, they demonstrate that there can be trigger\u0027 effects in climate, whereby small changesincluding man-made changescan produce catastrophically large effects. We have seen a foretaste of such effects in recent days with the calving of the world\u0027s largest iceberg, and the terrible loss of life from the flash flood in the American Southwest. And it is no difficulty to predict we will see more\"\n He paused, as Drake hurried up onto the stage, whispered in his ear, then stepped down again, looking at his watch.\n \"Uh, I must beg the forgiveness of you,\" the speaker said. \"I seem to have brought up an outdated version of my remarks. Word processors! That was a part from an old talk from 2001. What I wanted to say was that the calving of the iceberg in 2001larger than many American statesand the dangerously unseasonal weather around the world, including the sunny Southwest, portends further climate instability. It is just beginning.\"\n Sarah Jones, standing in the back, was talking with Ann Garner, the wife of a prominent Hollywood lawyer and a major contributor to NERF. Ann was emphatic as always, and talking nonstop.\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what I heard,\" Ann was saying. \"I heard there is an industry-sponsored campaign to discredit NGOs. Industry is afraid of the growing power of the environmental movement and they are desperate, desperate to stop it. We have had our modest successes in recent years, and it is driving them crazy, and\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Sarah said. \"Just a minute, Ann.\" She turned to look at the Russian speaker at the podium. What did he say? she thought.\n She walked quickly to the press table, where reporters were lined up with their laptops open. They were getting real-time transcripts of the conference.\n She looked over the shoulder of Ben Lopez, the reporter for the Los Angeles Times. Ben didn\u0027t mind; he had been after her for months.\n \"Hi ya, sweet thing.\"\n \"Hi, Ben. Mind if I look at something?\"\n She touched the mouse, scrolling up the screen.\n \"Sure, be my guest. Nice perfume.\"\n She read:\n CAN BE TRIGGER EFFECTS IN CLIMATE, WHEREBY SMALL CHANGES INCLUDING MAN-MADE CHANGES CAN PRODUCE CATASTROPHICALLY LARGE EFFECTS. WE HAVE HAD A FORETASTE OF SUCH EFFECTS IN RECENT DAYS WITH THE CALVING OF THE WORLD\u0027S LARGEST ICEBERG AND THE TERRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE FROM THE FLASH FLOOD IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST. AND IT IS NO DIFFICULTY TO PREDICT WE WILL SEE MORE While she watched, the text changed, the strikeout disappearing, and replaced with new text:\n CAN BE TRIGGER EFFECTS IN CLIMATE, WHEREBY SMALL CHANGES INCLUDING MAN-MADE CHANGES CAN PRODUCE CATASTROPHICALLY LARGE EFFECTS. WE HAVE HAD A FORETASTE OF SUCH EFFECTS WITH LARGE EFFECTS. WE HAVE HAD A FORETASTE OF SUCH EFFECTS WITH THE CALVING OF THE ICEBERG IN 2001 LARGER THAN MANY AMERICAN STATES AND THE DANGEROUSLY UNSEASONAL WEATHER AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING THE SUNNY SOUTHWEST PORTENDS FURTHER CLIMATE INSTABILITY \"Holy shit,\" she said.\n \"Something wrong?\" Ben said.\n \"Did you see what he said?\"\n \"Yeah. Poor guy. Probably has jet lag to beat hell. And obviously, he\u0027s struggling with English amp;\"\n The original remarks were gone. The record was corrected. But there was no doubt about it: the Russian had known in advance about the iceberg and the flash flood. It was written into his speech. And somebody had forgotten to tell him, when he got off the plane, that it never happened.\n He knew in advance.\n But now the record was corrected, the remarks stricken. She glanced at the video camera in the back, recording the proceedings. No doubt the remarks would disappear from the video record as well.\n The son of a bitch knew in advance.\n \"Hey,\" Ben said, \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re so upset about. Clue me in, will you?\"\n \"Later,\" she said. \"I promise.\" She patted his shoulder, and went back to Ann.\n \"So,\" Ann said, \"what we are facing is an industry-promoted campaign, well orchestrated, well financed, pervasive and ultra right-wing, that is intent on destroying the environmental movement that stands in its way.\"\n After what she had just seen, Sarah was in no mood to put up with this blather. \"Ann,\" she said. \"Did it ever cross your mind you might be paranoid?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-49.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: \n In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
