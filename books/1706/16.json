I had it on my hands, too, when I crouched down.\"\n \"So that explains why the glass was disturbed.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Lucky you didn\u0027t cut your hands.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n The third time he came back, he said, \"In your estimation, what time did the accident occur?\"\n \"What time?\" Evans looked at his watch. \"I have no idea. But let me see amp;\" He tried to work backward. The speech must have started about eight-thirty. Morton would have left the hotel at nine. Through San Francisco, then over the bridge amp;\"Maybe nine-forty-five, or ten at night.\"\n \"So, five hours ago? Roughly?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n The kid said, \"Huh.\" As if he were surprised.\n Evans looked over at the flatbed truck, which now held the crumpled remains of the Ferrari. One cop was standing on the flatbed, beside the car. Three other cops were on the street, talking with some animation. There was another man there, wearing a tuxedo. He was talking to the cops. When the man turned, Evans was surprised to see that it was John Kenner.\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" Evans asked the kid.\n \"I don\u0027t know. They just asked me to check on the time of the accident.\"\n Then the driver got into the flatbed truck, and started the engine. One of the cops yelled to the kid, \"Forget it, Eddie!\"\n \"Never mind, then,\" the kid said to Evans. \"I guess everything\u0027s okay.\"\n Evans looked over at Sarah, to see if she had noticed Kenner. She was leaning on the limousine, talking on the phone. Evans looked back in time to see Kenner get into a dark sedan driven by the Nepali guy, and drive off.\n The cops were leaving. The flatbed turned around and headed up the road, toward the bridge.\n Harry said, \"Looks like it\u0027s time to go.\"\n Evans got into the limousine. They drove back toward the lights of San Francisco.\n Chapter 23\n TO LOS ANGELES\n TUESDAY, OCTOBER 5\n 12:02 P.M.\n Morton\u0027s jet flew back to Los Angeles at noon. The mood was somber. All the same people were on board, and a few more, but they sat quietly, saying little. The late-edition papers had printed the story that millionaire philanthropist George Morton, depressed by the death of his beloved wife, Dorothy, had given a disjointed speech (termed \"rambling and illogical\" by the San Francisco Chronicle) and a few hours later had died in a tragic automobile crash while test-driving his new Ferrari.\n In the third paragraph, the reporter mentioned that single-car fatalities were frequently caused by undiagnosed depression and were often disguised suicides. And this, according to a quoted psychiatrist, was the likely explanation for Morton\u0027s death.\n About ten minutes into the flight, the actor Ted Bradley said, \"I think we should drink a toast in memory of George, and observe a minute of silence.\" And to a chorus of \"Hear, hear,\" glasses of champagne were passed all around.\n \"To George Morton,\" Ted said. \"A great American, a great friend, and a great supporter of the environment. We, and the planet, will miss him.\"\n For the next ten minutes, the celebrities on board remained relatively subdued, but slowly the conversation picked up, and finally they began to talk and argue as usual. Evans was sitting in the back, in the same seat he had occupied when they flew up. He watched the action at the table in the center, where Bradley was now explaining that the US got only 2 percent of its energy from sustainable sources and that we needed a crash program to build thousands of offshore wind farms, like England and Denmark were doing. The talk moved on to fuel cells, hydrogen cars, and photovoltaic households running off the grid. Some talked about how much they loved their hybrid cars, which they had bought for their staff to drive.\n Evans felt his spirits improve as he listened to them. Despite the loss of George Morton, there were still lots of people like thesefamous, high-profile people committed to changewho would lead the next generation to a more enlightened future.\n He was starting to drift off to sleep when Nicholas Drake dropped into the seat beside his. Drake leaned across the aisle. \"Listen,\" he said. \"I owe you an apology for last night.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right,\" Evans said.\n \"I was way out of line. And I want you to know I\u0027m sorry for how I behaved. I was upset, and very worried. You know George has been acting weird as hell the last couple of weeks. Talking strangely, picking fights. I guess in retrospect he was beginning to have a nervous breakdown. But I didn\u0027t know. Did you?\"\n \"I am not sure it was a nervous breakdown.\"\n \"It must have been,\" Drake said. \"What else could it have been? My God, the man disowns his life\u0027s work, and then goes out and kills himself. By the way, you can forget about any documents that he signed yesterday. Under the circumstances, he obviously was not in his right mind. And I know,\" he added, \"that you wouldn\u0027t argue the point differently. You\u0027re already conflicted enough, doing work both for him and for us. You really should have recused yourself and seen to it that any papers were drawn up by a neutral attorney. I\u0027m not going to accuse you of malpractice, but you\u0027ve shown highly questionable judgment.\"\n Evans said nothing. The threat was plain enough.\n \"Well, anyway,\" Drake said, resting his hand on Evans\u0027s knee, \"I just wanted to apologize. I know you did your best with a difficult situation, Peter. And amp;I think we\u0027re going to come out of this all right.\"\n The plane landed in Van Nuys. A dozen black SUV limos, the latest fashion, were lined up on the runway, waiting for the passengers. All the celebrities hugged, kissed air, and departed.\n Evans was the last to leave. He didn\u0027t rate a car and driver. He climbed into his little Prius hybrid, which he\u0027d parked there the day before, and drove through the gates and onto the freeway. He thought he should go to the office, but unexpected tears came to his eyes as he negotiated the midday traffic. He wiped them away and decided he was too damned tired to go to the office. Instead, he would go back to his apartment to get some sleep.\n He was almost home when his cell phone rang. It was Jennifer Haynes, at the Vanutu litigation team. \"I\u0027m sorry about George,\" she said. \"It\u0027s just terrible. Everybody here is very upset, as you can imagine. He pulled the funding, didn\u0027t he?\"\n \"Yes, but Nick will fight it. You\u0027ll get your funding.\"\n \"We need to have lunch,\" she said.\n \"Well, I think\"\n \"Today?\"\n Something in her voice made him say, \"I\u0027ll try.\"\n \"Phone me when you\u0027re here.\"\n He hung up. The phone rang again almost immediately. It was Margo Lane, Morton\u0027s mistress. She was angry. \"What the fuck is going on?\"\n \"How do you mean?\" Evans said.\n \"Was anybody going to fucking call me?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Margo\"\n \"I just saw it on TV. Missing in San Francisco and presumed dead. They had pictures of the car.\"\n \"I was going to call you,\" Evans said, \"when I got to my office.\" The truth was, she had completely slipped his mind.\n \"And when would that have been, next week? You\u0027re as bad as that sick assistant of yours. You\u0027re his lawyer, Peter. Do your fucking job. Because, you know, let\u0027s face it, this is not a surprise. I knew this was going to happen. We all did. I want you to come over here.\"\n \"I have a busy day.\"\n \"Just for a minute.\"\n \"All right,\" he said. \"Just for a minute.\"\n Chapter 24\n WEST LOS ANGELES\n TUESDAY, OCTOBER 5\n 3:04 P.M.\n Margo Lane lived on the fifteenth floor of a high-rise apartment building in the Wilshire Corridor. The doorman had to call up before Evans was allowed in the elevator. Margo knew he was coming up, but she still answered the door wrapped in a towel. \"Oh! I didn\u0027t realize you\u0027d be here so soon. Come in, I just got out of the shower.\" She frequently did something like this, flaunting her body. Evans came into the apartment and sat on the couch. She sat opposite him. The towel barely covered her torso.\n \"So,\" she said, \"what\u0027s all this about George?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Evans said, \"but George crashed his Ferrari at very high speed and was thrown from the car. He fell down a cliffthey found a shoe at the bottomand into the water. His body hasn\u0027t been recovered but they expect it to turn up in a week or so.\"\n With her love of drama, he was sure Margo would start to cry, but she didn\u0027t. She just stared at him. \"That\u0027s bullshit,\" she said.\n \"Why do you say that, Margo?\"\n \"Because. He\u0027s hiding or something. You know it.\"\n \"Hiding? From what?\"\n \"Probably nothing. He\u0027d become completely paranoid. You know that.\"\n As she said it, she crossed her legs. Evans was careful to keep his eyes on her face.\n \"Paranoid?\" he asked.\n \"Don\u0027t act like you didn\u0027t know, Peter. It was obvious.\"\n Evans shook his head. \"Not to me.\"\n \"The last time he came here was a couple of days ago,\" she said. \"He went right to the window and stood back behind the curtain, looking down onto the street. He was convinced he was being followed.\"\n \"Had he done that before?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I hadn\u0027t seen him much lately; he was traveling. But whenever I called him and asked when he was coming over, he said it wasn\u0027t safe to come here.\"\n Evans got up and walked to the window. He stood to one side and looked down at the street below.\n \"Are you being followed, too?\" she said.\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n Traffic on Wilshire Boulevard was heavy, the start of afternoon rush hour. Three lanes of cars moving fast in each direction. He could hear the roar of the traffic, even up there. But there was no place to park, to pull out from the traffic. A blue Prius hybrid had pulled to the curb across the street, and traffic was backing up behind it, honking. After a moment, the Prius started up again.\n No place to stop.\n \"Do you see anything suspicious?\" she asked.\n \"No.\"\n \"I never did either. But George didor thought he did.\"\n \"Did he say who was following him?\"\n \"No.\" She shifted again. \"I thought he should have medication. I told him.\"\n \"And what did he say to that?\"\n \"He said I was in danger, too. He told me I should leave town for a while. Go visit my sister in Oregon. But I won\u0027t.\"\n Her towel was coming loose. Margo tightened it, lowering it across her firm, enhanced breasts. \"So I\u0027m telling you, George went into hiding,\" she said. \"And I think you better find him fast, because the man needs help.\"\n \"I see,\" Evans said. \"But I suppose it\u0027s possible he isn\u0027t in hiding, that he really crashed his car amp;. In which case, there are things you need to do now, Margo.\"\n He explained to her that if George remained missing, his assets could be ordered frozen. Which meant that she ought to withdraw everything from the bank account into which he put money for her every month. So she would be sure to have money to live on.\n \"But that\u0027s silly,\" she protested. \"I know he\u0027ll be back in a few days.\"\n \"Just in case,\" Evans said.\n She frowned. \"Do you know something you\u0027re not telling me?\"\n \"No,\" Evans said. \"I\u0027m just saying, it could be a while before this thing gets cleared up.\"\n \"Look,\" she said. \"He\u0027s sick. You\u0027re supposed to be his friend. Find him.\"\n Evans said that he would try. When he left, Margo was flouncing off to the bedroom to get dressed before going to the bank.\n Outside, in the milky afternoon sunlight, fatigue overwhelmed him. All he wanted to do was go home and go to sleep. He got in his car and started driving. He was within sight of his apartment when his phone rang again.\n It was Jennifer, asking where he was.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t come today.\"\n \"It\u0027s important, Peter. Really.\"\n He said he was sorry, and would call her later.\n Then Lisa, Herb Lowenstein\u0027s secretary, called to say that Nicholas Drake had been trying to reach him all afternoon. \"He really wants to talk to you.\"\n \"Okay,\" Evans said, \"I\u0027ll call.\"\n \"He sounds pissed.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"But you better call Sarah first.\"\n \"Why?\"\n His phone went dead. It always did in the back alley of his apartment; it was a dead spot in the cellular net. He slipped the phone into his shirt pocket; he\u0027d call in a few minutes. He drove down the alley, and pulled into his garage space.\n He walked up the back stairs to his apartment and unlocked the door.\n And stared.\n The apartment was a mess. Furniture torn apart, cushions slashed open, papers all over the place, books tumbled out of the bookshelves and lying scattered on the floor.\n He stood in the entrance, stunned. After a moment he walked into the room, straightened one of the toppled chairs and sat down in it. It occurred to him that he had to call the police. He got up, found the phone on the floor, and dialed them. But almost immediately the cell phone in his pocket began to ring. He hung up on the police and answered the cell phone. \"Yes.\"\n It was Lisa. \"We got cut off,\" she said. \"You better call Sarah right away.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"She\u0027s over at Morton\u0027s house. There was a robbery there.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I know. You better call her,\" she said. \"She sounded upset.\"\n Evans flipped the phone shut. He stood and walked into the kitchen. Everything was a mess there, too. He glanced into the bedroom. Everything was a mess. All he could think was the maid wasn\u0027t coming until next Tuesday. How could he ever clean this up?\n He dialed his phone.\n \"Sarah?\"\n \"Is that you, Peter?\"\n \"Yes. What happened?\"\n \"Not on the phone. Have you gone home yet?\"\n \"Just got here.\"\n \"So amp;did it happen to you too?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-16.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: \n In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
