Not his usual self at all.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s traveling with him?\"\\n\\n \"As far as I know, nobody.\"\\n\\n Evans frowned. That was very odd. Morton hated being alone. Evans\u0027s immediate inclination was to disbelieve it.\\n\\n \"What about that guy Kenner and his Nepali friend?\"\\n\\n \"Last I heard, they were going to Vancouver, and on to Japan. So they\u0027re not with him.\"\\n\\n \"Uh huh.\"\\n\\n \"When I hear from him, I\u0027ll let him know you called.\"\\n\\n Evans hung up, feeling dissatisfied. On an impulse, he dialed Morton\u0027s cell phone. But he got the voice mail. \"This is George. At the beep.\" And the quick beep.\\n\\n \"George, this is Peter Evans. Just checking in, to see if there\u0027s anything you need. Call me at the office if I can help.\"\\n\\n He hung up, and stared out the window. Then he dialed again.\\n\\n \"Center for Risk Analysis.\"\\n\\n \"Professor Kenner\u0027s office, please.\"\\n\\n In a moment he got the secretary. \"This is Peter Evans, I\u0027m looking for Professor Kenner.\"\\n\\n \"Oh yes, Mr. Evans. Dr. Kenner said you might call.\"\\n\\n \"He did?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Are you trying to reach Dr. Kenner?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I am.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in Tokyo at the moment. Would you like his cell phone?\"\\n\\n \"Please.\"\\n\\n She gave him the number, and he wrote it down on his yellow pad. He was about to call when his assistant, Heather, came in to say that something at lunch had disagreed with her, and she was going home for the afternoon.\\n\\n \"Feel better,\" he said, sighing.\\n\\n With her gone, he was obliged to answer his own phone, and the next call was from Margo Lane, George\u0027s mistress, asking where the hell George was. Evans was on the phone with her for the better part of half an hour.\\n\\n And then Nicholas Drake walked into his office.\\n\\n \"I am very concerned,\" Drake said. He stood at the window, hands clasped behind his back, staring at the office building opposite.\\n\\n \"About what?\"\\n\\n \"This Kenner person that George is spending so much time with.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that they\u0027re spending time together.\"\\n\\n \"Of course they are. You don\u0027t seriously believe George is alone, do you?\"\\n\\n Evans said nothing.\\n\\n \"George is never alone. We both know that. Peter, I don\u0027t like this situation at all. Not at all. George is a good manI don\u0027t have to tell you thatbut he is susceptible to influence. Including the wrong influence.\"\\n\\n \"You think a professor at MIT is the wrong influence?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve looked into Professor Kenner,\" Drake said, \"and there are a few mysteries about him.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"His rйsumй says he spent a number of years in government. Department of the Interior, Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee, and so on.\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"The Department of the Interior has no record of his working there.\"\\n\\n Evans shrugged. \"It was more than ten years ago. Government records being what they are amp;\"\\n\\n \"Possibly,\" Drake said. \"But there is more. Professor Kenner comes back to MIT, works there for eight years, very successfully. Consultant to the EPA, consultant to Department of Defense, God knows what elseand then he suddenly goes on extended leave, and no one seems to know what happened to him since. He just fell off the radar.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Evans said. \"His card says he is Director of Risk Analysis.\"\\n\\n \"But he\u0027s on leave. I don\u0027t know what the hell he is doing these days. I don\u0027t know who supports him. I take it you\u0027ve met him?\"\\n\\n \"Briefly.\"\\n\\n \"And now he and George are great pals?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, Nick. I haven\u0027t seen or spoken to George in more than a week.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s off with Kenner.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that.\"\\n\\n \"But you know that he and Kenner went to Vancouver.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, I didn\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Let me lay it out for you plainly,\" Drake said. \"I have it on good authority that John Kenner has unsavory connections. The Center for Risk Analysis is wholly funded by industry groups. I needn\u0027t say more. In addition, Mr. Kenner spent a number of years advising the Pentagon and in fact was so involved with them that he even underwent some sort of training for a period of time.\"\\n\\n \"You mean military training?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Fort Bragg and Harvey Point, in North Carolina,\" Drake said. \"There is no question the man has military connections as well as industry connections. And I am told he is hostile toward mainstream environmental organizations. I hate to think of a man like that working on poor George.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t worry about George. He can see through propaganda.\"\\n\\n \"I hope so. But frankly I do not share your confidence. This military man shows up, and the next thing we know, George is trying to audit us. I mean, my God, why would he want to do that? Doesn\u0027t George realize what a waste of resources that involves? Time, money, everything? It would be a tremendous drag on my time.\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t aware an audit was going forward.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s being discussed. Of course, we have nothing to hide, and we can be audited at any time. I have always said so. But this is an especially busy time, with the Vanutu lawsuit starting up, and the conference on Abrupt Climate Change to be planned for. All that\u0027s in the next few weeks. I wish I could speak to George.\"\\n\\n Evans shrugged. \"Call his cell.\"\\n\\n \"I have. Have you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"He call you back?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Evans said.\\n\\n Drake shook his head. \"That man,\" he said, \"is my Concerned Citizen of the Year, and I can\u0027t even get him on the phone.\"\\n\\n Chapter 18\\n\\n BEVERLY HILLS\\n\\n MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 13\\n\\n 8:07 A.M.\\n\\n Morton sat at a sidewalk table outside a cafй on Beverly Drive at eight in the morning, waiting for Sarah to show up. His assistant was ordinarily punctual, and her apartment was not far away. Unless she had taken up with that actor again. Young people had so much time to waste on bad relationships.\\n\\n He sipped his coffee, glancing at the Wall Street Journal without much interest. He had even less interest after an unusual couple sat down at the next table.\\n\\n The woman was petite and strikingly beautiful, with dark hair and an exotic look. She might have been Moroccan; it was hard to judge from her accent. Her clothing was chic and out of place in casual Los Angelestight-fitting skirt, spike heels, Chanel jacket.\\n\\n The man who accompanied her could not have been more different. He was a red-faced, beefy American, with slightly piggish features, wearing a sweater, baggy khakis, and running shoes. He was as big as a football player. He slumped at the table and said, \"I\u0027ll have a latte, sweetheart. Nonfat. Grande.\"\\n\\n She said, \"I thought you would get one for me, like a gentleman.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a gentleman,\" he said. \"And you\u0027re no fucking lady. Not after you didn\u0027t come home last night. So we can forget about ladies and gentlemen, okay?\"\\n\\n She pouted. \"Chйri, do not make a scene.\"\\n\\n \"Hey. I asked you to get a fucking latte. Who\u0027s making a scene?\"\\n\\n \"But chйri\"\\n\\n \"You going to get it, or not?\" He glared at her. \"I\u0027ve really had it with you, Marisa, you know that?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t own me,\" she said. \"I do as I please.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve made that obvious.\"\\n\\n During this conversation, Morton\u0027s paper had been slowly drifting downward. Now he folded it flat, set it on his knee, and pretended to read. But in fact he could not take his eyes off this woman. She was extremely beautiful, he decided, although not very young. She was probably thirty-five. Her maturity somehow made her more overtly sexual. He was captivated.\\n\\n She said to the football player, \"William, you are tiresome.\"\\n\\n \"You want me to leave?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps it is best.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, fuck you,\" he said, and slapped her.\\n\\n Morton could not restrain himself. \"Hey,\" he said, \"take it easy there.\"\\n\\n The woman gave him a smile. The beefy man stood up, fists bunched. \"Mind your own fucking business!\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t hit the lady, pal.\"\\n\\n \"How about just you and me?\" he said, shaking his fist.\\n\\n At that moment, a Beverly Hills cruiser drove by. Morton looked at it, and waved. The cruiser came over to the curb. \"Everything all right?\" one of the cops said.\\n\\n \"Just fine, officer,\" Morton said.\\n\\n \"Fuck this noise,\" the football player said, and turned away. He stalked off up the street.\\n\\n The dark woman smiled at Morton. \"Thank you for that.\"\\n\\n \"No problem. Did I hear you say you wanted a latte?\"\\n\\n She smiled again. She crossed her legs, exposing brown knees. \"If you would be so kind.\"\\n\\n Morton was standing to get it when Sarah called to him, \"Hey, George! Sorry to be late.\" She came jogging up in a tracksuit. As always, she looked very beautiful.\\n\\n Anger flashed across the dark woman\u0027s features. It was fleeting, but Morton caught it and he thought, Something is wrong here. He didn\u0027t know this woman. She had no reason to be angry. Probably, he decided, she had wanted to teach the boyfriend a lesson. Even now the guy was hanging around at the end of the block, pretending to look in a shop window. But at this early hour, all the shops were closed.\\n\\n \"Ready to go?\" Sarah said.\\n\\n Morton made brief apologies to the woman, who made little gestures of indifference. He had the feeling now that she was French.\\n\\n \"Perhaps we will meet again,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said, \"but I doubt it. I am sorry. Зa va.\"\\n\\n \"Have a nice day.\"\\n\\n As they walked off, Sarah said, \"Who was that?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. She sat down at the next table.\"\\n\\n \"Spicy little number.\"\\n\\n He shrugged.\\n\\n \"Did I interrupt something? No? That\u0027s good.\" She handed Morton three manila folders. \"This one\u0027s your contributions to NERF to date. This one is the agreement for the last contribution, so you have the language. And this one is the cashier\u0027s check you wanted. Be careful with that. It\u0027s a big number.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. It\u0027s not a problem. I\u0027m leaving in an hour.\"\\n\\n \"You want to tell me where?\"\\n\\n Morton shook his head. \"It\u0027s better you don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n Chapter 19\\n\\n CENTURY CITY\\n\\n MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27\\n\\n 9:45 A.M.\\n\\n Evans had heard nothing from Morton for almost two weeks. He could not remember ever having gone so long without contact with his client. He had lunch with Sarah, who was visibly anxious. \"Do you hear from him at all?\" he said.\\n\\n \"Not a word.\"\\n\\n \"What do the pilots say?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re in Van Nuys. He\u0027s rented a different plane. I don\u0027t know where he is.\"\\n\\n \"And he\u0027s coming back amp;\"\\n\\n She shrugged. \"Who knows?\"\\n\\n And so it was with considerable surprise that he received Sarah\u0027s call that day. \"You better get going,\" she said. \"George wants to see you right away.\"\\n\\n \"Where?\"\\n\\n \"At NERF. In Beverly Hills.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s back?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll say.\"\\n\\n It was a ten-minute drive from his offices in Century City to the NERF building. Of course the National Environmental Resource Fund was headquartered in Washington, DC, but they had recently opened a west coast office, in Beverly Hills. Cynics claimed that NERF had done it to be closer to the Hollywood celebrities who were so essential to their fund-raising. But that was just gossip.\\n\\n Evans half expected to find Morton pacing outside, but he was nowhere in sight. Evans went into the reception area and was told that Morton was in the third-floor conference room. He walked up to the third floor.\\n\\n The conference room was glass-walled on two sides. The interior was furnished with a large, boardroom-style table and eighteen chairs. There was an audiovisual unit in the corner for presentations.\\n\\n Evans saw three people in the conference room, and an argument in progress. Morton stood at the front of the room, red-faced, gesticulating. Drake was also standing, pacing back and forth, pointing an angry finger at Morton, and shouting back at him. Evans also saw John Henley, the saturnine head of PR for NERF. He was bent over, making notes on a yellow legal pad. It was clearly an argument between Morton and Drake.\\n\\n Evans was not sure what to do, so he stood there. After a moment, Morton saw him and made a quick jabbing motion, indicating that Evans should sit down outside. He did. And watched the argument through the glass.\\n\\n It turned out there was a fourth person in the room as well. Evans hadn\u0027t seen him at first because he was hunched down behind the podium, but when that person stood, Evans saw a workman in clean, neatly pressed overalls carrying a briefcase-style toolbox and with a couple of electronic meters clipped to his belt. On his chest pocket a logo read av network systems.\\n\\n The workman looked confused. Apparently Drake didn\u0027t want the workman in the room during the argument, whereas Morton seemed to like an audience. Drake wanted the guy to go; Morton insisted he stay. Caught in the middle, the workman looked uncomfortable, and ducked down out of sight again. But soon after, Drake prevailed, and the workman left.\\n\\n As the workman walked past him, Evans said, \"Rough day?\"\\n\\n The workman shrugged. \"They got a lot of network problems in this building,\" he said. \"Myself, I think it\u0027s bad Ethernet cable, or the routers are overheating amp;\" And he walked on.\\n\\n Back inside, the argument raged, fiercer than ever. It continued for another five minutes. The glass was almost entirely soundproof, but from time to time, when they shouted, Evans could hear a phrase. He heard Morton yell, \"God damn it, I want to win!\" and he heard Drake reply, \"It\u0027s just too risky.\" Which made Morton even angrier.\\n\\n And later Morton said, \"Don\u0027t we have to fight for the most important issue facing our planet?\" And Drake answered something about being practical, or facing reality. And Morton said, \"Fuck reality!\"\\n\\n At which point the PR guy, Henley, glanced up and said, \"My sentiments exactly.\" Or something like that. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-13.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
