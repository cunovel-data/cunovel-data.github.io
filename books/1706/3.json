{"id":66379,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"As it began to clear, Ling said, \"Now we will show how the beam is focused.\" The rumbling began again, and this time the cliff blurred much farther down, two hundred feet or more. Once again the gray sand gave way, this time sliding rather quietly into the lake.\\n\\n \"And it can focus laterally as well?\" Peterson said.\\n\\n Ling said it could. A hundred yards north of the truck, the cliff was shaken free, and again tumbled down.\\n\\n \"We can aim it in any direction, and any depth.\"\\n\\n \"Any depth?\"\\n\\n \"Our big unit will focus at a thousand meters. Although no client has any use for such depths.\"\\n\\n \"No, no,\" Peterson said. \"We don\u0027t need anything like that. But we want beam power.\" He wiped his hands on his trousers. \"I\u0027ve seen enough.\"\\n\\n \"Really? We have quite a few other techniques to demon\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ready to go back.\" Behind his sunglasses, his eyes were unreadable.\\n\\n \"Very well,\" Ling said. \"If you are sure\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure.\"\\n\\n Driving back, Peterson said, \"You ship from KL or Hong Kong?\"\\n\\n \"From KL.\"\\n\\n \"With what restrictions?\"\\n\\n Ling said, \"How do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Hypersonic cavitation technology in the US is restricted. It can\u0027t be exported without a license.\"\\n\\n \"As I said, we use Taiwanese electronics.\"\\n\\n \"Is it as reliable as the US technology?\"\\n\\n Ling said, \"Virtually identical.\" If Peterson knew his business, he would know that the US had long ago lost the capacity to manufacture such advanced chipsets. The US cavitation chipsets were manufactured in Taiwan. \"Why do you ask? Are you planning to export to the US?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Then there is no difficulty.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your lead time?\" Peterson said.\\n\\n \"We need seven months.\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking of five.\"\\n\\n \"It can be done. There will be a premium. For how many units?\"\\n\\n \"Three,\" Peterson said.\\n\\n Ling wondered why anyone would need three cavitation units. No geological survey company in the world owned more than one.\\n\\n \"I can fill that order,\" Ling said, \"upon receipt of your deposit.\"\\n\\n \"You will have it wired to you tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"And we are shipping where? Canada?\"\\n\\n \"You will receive shipping instructions,\" Peterson said, \"in five months.\"\\n\\n Directly ahead, the curved spans of the ultra-modern airport designed by Kurokawa rose into the sky. Peterson had lapsed into silence. Driving up the ramp, Ling said, \"I hope we are in time for your flight.\"\\n\\n \"What? Oh yes. We\u0027re fine.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re heading back to Canada?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n Ling pulled up at the international terminal, got out, and shook Peterson\u0027s hand. Peterson shouldered his day bag. It was his only luggage. \"Well,\" Peterson said. \"I\u0027d better go.\"\\n\\n \"Safe flight.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you. You, too. Back to Hong Kong?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Ling said. \"I have to go to the factory, and get them started.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nearby?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, in Pudu Raya. Just a few kilometers.\"\\n\\n \"All right, then.\" Peterson disappeared inside the terminal, giving a final wave. Ling got back in the car and drove away. But as he was heading down the ramp, he saw that Peterson had left behind his cell phone on the car seat. He pulled over to the curb, glancing back over his shoulder. But Peterson was gone. And the cell phone in his hand was lightweight, made of cheap plastic. It was one of those prepaid-card phones, the disposable ones. It couldn\u0027t be Peterson\u0027s main phone.\\n\\n It occurred to Ling that he had a friend who might be able to trace the phone and the card inside it. Find out more about the purchaser. And Ling would like to know more. So he slipped the phone into his pocket and drove north, to the factory.\\n\\n Chapter 2\\n\\n SHAD THAMES\\n\\n FRIDAY, MAY 21\\n\\n 11:04 A.M.\\n\\n Richard Mallory looked up from his desk and said, \"Yes?\"\\n\\n The man standing in the doorway was pale-complected, slender, and American-looking, with a blond crew cut. His manner was casual, his dress nondescript: dirty Adidas running shoes and a faded navy tracksuit. He looked as if he might be out for a jog and had stopped by the office for a moment.\\n\\n And since this was Design/Quest, a hot graphics shop located on Butler\u0027s Wharf, a refurbished warehouse district below London\u0027s Tower Bridge, most of the employees in the office were casually dressed. Mallory was the exception. Since he was the boss, he wore slacks and a white shirt. And wingtip shoes that hurt his feet. But they were hip.\\n\\n Mallory said, \"Can I help you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve come for the package,\" the American said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry. What package?\" Mallory said. \"If it\u0027s a DHL pickup, the secretary has it up front.\"\\n\\n The American looked annoyed. \"Don\u0027t you think you\u0027re overdoing it?\" he said. \"Just give me the fucking package.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, fine,\" Mallory said, getting up from behind the desk.\\n\\n Apparently the American felt he had been too harsh, because in a quieter tone he said, \"Nice posters,\" and pointed to the wall behind Mallory. \"You do \u0027em?\"\\n\\n \"We did,\" Mallory said. \"Our firm.\"\\n\\n There were two posters, side by side on the wall, both stark black with a hanging globe of the Earth in space, differing only in the tag line. One said \"Save the Earth\" and beneath it, \"It\u0027s the Only Home We Have.\" The other said \"Save the Earth\" and beneath that, \"There\u0027s Nowhere Else to Go.\"\\n\\n Then off to one side was a framed photograph of a blond model in a T-shirt: \"Save the Earth\" and the copy line was \"And Look Good Doing It.\"\\n\\n \"That was our Save the Earth\u0027 campaign,\" Mallory said. \"But they didn\u0027t buy it.\"\\n\\n \"Who didn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"International Conservation Fund.\"\\n\\n He went past the American and headed down the back stairs to the garage. The American followed.\\n\\n \"Why not? They didn\u0027t like it?\"\\n\\n \"No, they liked it,\" Mallory said. \"But they got Leo as a spokesman, and used him instead. Campaign went to video spots.\"\\n\\n At the bottom of the stairs, he swiped his card, and the door unlocked with a click. They stepped into the small garage beneath the building. It was dark except for the glare of daylight from the ramp leading to the street. Mallory noticed with annoyance that a van partly blocked the ramp. They always had trouble with delivery vans parking there.\\n\\n He turned to the American. \"You have a car?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. A van.\" He pointed.\\n\\n \"Oh good, so that\u0027s yours. And somebody to help you?\"\\n\\n \"No. Just me. Why?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s bloody heavy,\" Mallory said. \"It may just be wire, but it\u0027s half a million feet of it. Weighs seven hundred pounds, mate.\"\\n\\n \"I can handle it.\"\\n\\n Mallory went to his Rover and unlocked the boot. The American whistled, and the van rumbled down the ramp. It was driven by a tough-looking woman with spiked hair, dark makeup.\\n\\n Mallory said, \"I thought you were alone.\"\\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t know anything,\" the American said. \"Forget her. She brought the van. She just drives.\"\\n\\n Mallory turned to the open boot. There were stacked white boxes marked \"Ethernet Cable (Unshielded).\" And printed specifications.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s see one,\" the American said.\\n\\n Mallory opened a box. Inside was a jumble of fist-sized coils of very thin wire, each in shrink-wrap plastic. \"As you see,\" he said, \"it\u0027s guide wire. For anti-tank missiles.\"\\n\\n \"Is it?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what they told me. That\u0027s why it\u0027s wrapped that way. One coil of wire for each missile.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t know,\" the American said. \"I\u0027m just the delivery man.\" He went and opened the back of his van. Then he began to transfer the boxes, one at a time. Mallory helped.\\n\\n The American said, \"This guy tell you anything else?\"\\n\\n \"Actually, he did,\" Mallory said. \"He said somebody bought five hundred surplus Warsaw Pact rockets. Called Hotfire or Hotwire or something. No warheads or anything. Just the rocket bodies. The story is they were sold with defective guide wire.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t heard that.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what he said. Missiles were bought in Sweden. Gothenburg, I think. Shipped out from there.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like you\u0027re worried.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not worried,\" Mallory said.\\n\\n \"Like you\u0027re afraid you\u0027re mixed up in something.\"\\n\\n \"Not me.\"\\n\\n \"Sure about that?\" the American said.\\n\\n \"Yes, of course I\u0027m sure.\"\\n\\n Most of the boxes were transferred to the van. Mallory started to sweat. The American seemed to be glancing at him out of the corner of his eye. Openly skeptical. He said, \"So, tell me. What\u0027d he look like, this guy?\"\\n\\n Mallory knew better than to answer that. He shrugged. \"Just a guy.\"\\n\\n \"American?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know whether he was American or not?\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t be sure of his accent.\"\\n\\n \"Why is that?\" the American said.\\n\\n \"He might have been Canadian.\"\\n\\n \"Alone?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Because I hear talk about some gorgeous woman. Sexy woman in high heels, tight skirt.\"\\n\\n \"I would have noticed a woman like that,\" Mallory said.\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t be amp;leaving her out?\" Another skeptical glance. \"Keeping her to yourself?\" Mallory noticed a bulge on the American\u0027s hip. Was it a gun? It might be.\\n\\n \"No. He was alone.\"\\n\\n \"Whoever the guy was.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"You ask me,\" the American said, \"I\u0027d be wondering why anybody needed half a million feet of wire for anti-tank missiles in the first place. I mean, for what?\"\\n\\n Mallory said, \"He didn\u0027t say.\"\\n\\n \"And you just said, Right, mate, half a million feet of wire, leave it to me,\u0027 with never a question?\"\\n\\n \"Seems like you\u0027re asking all the questions,\" Mallory said. Still sweating.\\n\\n \"And I have a reason,\" the American said. His tone turned ominous. \"I got to tell you, pal. I don\u0027t like what I am hearing.\"\\n\\n The last of the boxes were stacked in the van. Mallory stepped back. The American slammed the first door shut, then the second. As the second door closed, Mallory saw the driver standing there. The woman. She had been standing behind the door.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like it either,\" she said. She was wearing fatigues, army surplus stuff. Baggy trousers and high-laced boots. A bulky green jacket. Heavy gloves. Dark glasses.\\n\\n \"Now wait a minute,\" the American said.\\n\\n \"Give me your cell phone,\" she said. Holding out her hand for it. Her other hand was behind her back. As if she had a gun.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Give it to me.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"I want to look at it, that\u0027s why.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing unusual\"\\n\\n \"Give it to me.\"\\n\\n The American pulled the cell phone out of his pocket and handed it to her. Instead of taking it, she grabbed his wrist and pulled him toward her. The cell phone clattered to the ground. She brought her other hand from around her back and quickly gripped the side of his neck with her gloved hand. She held him with both hands around his neck, as if she were strangling him.\\n\\n For a moment he was stunned; then he began to struggle. \"What the fuck are you doing?\" he said. \"What are youhey!\" He knocked her hands away and jumped back as if he had been burned. \"What was that? What did you do?\"\\n\\n He touched his neck. A tiny trickle of blood ran down, just a few drops. There was red on his fingertips. Almost nothing.\\n\\n \"What did you do?\" he said.\\n\\n \"Nothing.\" She was stripping off her gloves. Mallory could see she was doing it carefully. As if something were in the glove. Something she did not want to touch.\\n\\n \"Nothing?\" the American said. \"Nothing? Son of a bitch!\" Abruptly, he turned and began to run up the ramp toward the street outside.\\n\\n Calmly, she watched him go. She bent over, picked up the cell phone, and put it in her pocket. Then she turned to Mallory. \"Go back to work.\"\\n\\n He hesitated.\\n\\n \"You did a good job. I never saw you. You never saw me. Now go.\"\\n\\n Mallory turned and walked to the back-stairs door. Behind him, he heard the woman slam the van door, and when he glanced back, he saw the van racing up the ramp into the glare of the street. The van turned right, and was gone.\\n\\n Back in his office, his assistant, Elizabeth, came in with a mockup for the new ultralight computer ads for Toshiba. The shoot was tomorrow. These were the finals to go over. He shuffled through the boards quickly; Mallory had trouble concentrating.\\n\\n Elizabeth said, \"You don\u0027t like them?\"\\n\\n \"No, no, they\u0027re fine.\"\\n\\n \"You look a little pale.\"\\n\\n \"I just, um amp;my stomach.\"\\n\\n \"Ginger tea,\" she said. \"That\u0027s best. Shall I make some?\"\\n\\n He nodded, to get her out of the office. He looked out the window. Mallory\u0027s office had a spectacular view of the Thames, and the Tower Bridge off to the left. The bridge had been repainted baby blue and white (was that traditional or just a bad idea?), but to see it always made him feel good. Secure somehow.\\n\\n He walked closer to the window, and stood looking at the bridge. He was thinking that when his best friend had asked if he would lend a hand in a radical environmental cause, it had sounded like something fun. A bit of secrecy, a bit of dash and derring-do. He had been promised that it would not involve anything violent. Mallory had never imagined he would be frightened.\\n\\n But he was frightened now. His hands were shaking. He stuck them in his pockets as he stared out the window. Five hundred rockets? he thought. Five hundred rockets. What had he gotten himself into? Then, slowly, he realized that he was hearing sirens, and there were red lights flashing on the bridge railings.\\n\\n There had been an accident on the bridge. And judging from the number of police and rescue vehicles, it was a serious accident. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-3.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
