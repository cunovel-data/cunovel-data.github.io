Once it\u0027s triggered, El Niсo lasts about a year and a half, affecting weather around the world. El Niсo occurs roughly every four yearstwenty-three times in the last century. And it has been occurring for thousands of years. So it long precedes any claim of global warming.* But what threat does El Niсo represent to the US, Ted? There was a major El Niсo in 1998.\"\n \"Floods, crops ruined, like that.\"\n \"All that happened. But the net economic effect of the last El Niсo was a gain of fifteen billion dollars because of a longer growing season and less use of winter heating oil. That\u0027s after deducting $1.5 billion for flooding and excess rain in California. Still a net benefit.\"\n \"I\u0027d like to see that study,\" Bradley said.\n \"I\u0027ll make sure you get it. Because of course it also suggests that if global warming really does occur, it will probably benefit most nations of the world.\"\n \"But not all.\"\n \"No, Ted. Not all.\"\n \"So what exactly is your point?\" Bradley said. \"You\u0027re saying that we don\u0027t need to pay any attention to the environment, that we can just leave it alone and let industry pollute and everything will be hunkydory?\"\n For a [moment, it looked to Sarah as if Kenner would get angry, but he did not. He said, \"If you oppose the death penalty, does it also mean you are in favor of doing nothing at all about crime?\"\n \"No,\" Ted said.\n \"You can oppose the death penalty but still favor punishing criminals.\"\n \"Yes. Of course.\"\n \"Then I can say that global warming is not a threat but still favor environmental controls, can\u0027t I?\"\n \"But it doesn\u0027t sound like you are saying that.\"\n Kenner sighed.\n Sarah was listening to this exchange, thinking Bradley wasn\u0027t really hearing what Kenner had to say. As if to prove her thoughts, Bradley continued: \"Well? Aren\u0027t you saying that the environment needs no protection from us? Isn\u0027t that what you are really saying?\"\n Kenner said, \"No,\" in a way that suggested that the conversation was over.\n Sarah thought: Ted really is a fool. He has a severely limited understanding of what he is talking about. Ted was an actor with a script, at a loss if the conversation moved away from scripted lines.\n She turned away and looked toward the front of the cabin. She saw Peter talking to Jennifer, their heads together. There was a sort of intimacy in their gestures that was instantly recognizable.\n She was glad when the pilot announced they were landing in Los Angeles.\n Chapter 66\n VAN NUYS\n TUESDAY, OCTOBER 12\n 11:22 P.M.\n Sanjong Thapa was waiting at the airport, looking worried. He and Kenner got immediately into a car and drove off. Sarah went home to her apartment. Bradley climbed into an SUV limo and left with an irritable wave. He was already on his cell phone. Peter Evans drove Jennifer to her car, which was back in Culver City. There was an awkward moment saying good-bye. He wanted to kiss her but sensed some reserve, and didn\u0027t. She promised she would call him in the morning.\n He drove home, thinking of her. Sarah did not enter his mind.\n It was almost midnight when Evans got back to his apartment. He was very tired and was stripping off his shirt when the phone rang. It was Janis, the exercise instructor. \"Where have you been, you cute thing?\"\n \"Traveling,\" he said.\n \"I have called you every single day,\" she said. \"Sometimes more. Sometimes every hour.\"\n \"Uh-huh. What\u0027s up?\"\n \"My boyfriend broke up with me.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that,\" Evans said. \"Was it very\"\n \"Can I come over?\" she said.\n He sighed. \"You know, Janis, I\u0027m really tired amp;\"\n \"I need to talk to you. I promise I won\u0027t stay, if you don\u0027t want me to. I\u0027m only about a block away. Five minutes?\"\n He sighed again, louder this time. \"Janis, tonight is not\"\n \"Okay, good, see you in five.\"\n Click.\n He sighed. He took his shirt off and tossed it in the hamper. She never listened, that was the trouble. He decided that when she got to his apartment, he would just tell her to leave. That\u0027s all. Just go.\n Or then again, maybe he wouldn\u0027t.\n Janis was uncomplicated. He was ready for an uncomplicated exchange. He pulled off his shoes and dropped them on the floor. On the other hand, he didn\u0027t want Janis around in the morning if Jennifer called. Would Jennifer call? She said she would. Did Jennifer know his home number? He wasn\u0027t sure. Maybe not.\n He decided to take a shower. He might not hear Janis in the shower, so he unlocked the front door for her and headed for the bathroom. The hallway was dark and he had just a fleeting glimpse of a dark shadow before something hit him on the head, very hard. Evans yelled. The pain was intense, making him gasp, and he fell to his knees. He groaned. Someone hit him again, this time in the ear, and he fell over on his side.\n Disoriented, he found himself staring at a pair of feet in dirty socks. He was being dragged into the living room. He was dropped unceremoniously on the floor. There were three men, moving around him. They had dark masks over their faces, like ski masks. One of them stepped on both his arms, pinning him down, flat on his back. Another one sat on his legs and said, \"Don\u0027t talk. Don\u0027t move.\" A growly menacing voice.\n Evans couldn\u0027t move anyway. He still felt disoriented. He looked around for the third man. He heard sloshing water. He glimpsed what looked like a plastic baggie.\n \"Hold him good.\" The third man spoke in a whisper. He crouched by Evans\u0027s shoulder, pulled up the shirtsleeve, exposing the flesh of his arm. He was wheezing softly behind the black mask. In the same whisper, he said, \"You know what this is?\"\n He held up the baggie. The water was cloudy. Evans saw what looked like a fleshy ball, and in a panic he thought, Oh God, they cut somebody\u0027s balls off. But then he saw the ball moving, undulating. It was brown with white spots, about the size of a golf ball.\n \"You know?\" the man said.\n Evans shook his head.\n \"You will,\" the man whispered, and unzipped the baggie. He pushed it against the underside of Evans\u0027s arm. Evans felt wetness. The man was manipulating the baggie, squeezing the ball. Evans was trying to see, but it was hard to see exactly what was The ball moved. It spread, extended what looked like wings. No, not wings. It was a tiny octopus! Tiny! It could not have weighed more than a few ounces. Brownish with white rings. The man was squeezing the baggie, compressing it, pushing the little octopus toward the flesh of Evans\u0027s arm.\n And then he understood.\n Evans moaned and began to struggle, trying to move against his captors, but they had him firmly, and he felt the touch of the octopus, a kind of sticky sensation, like cellophane or Sticky Putty or something. He lifted his head in horror and saw that the man was snapping the baggie with his finger, trying to goad the octopus, which had wrapped itself against the skin of Evans\u0027s arm, and in a flash the rings on the octopus changed from white to blue.\n The blue ring of death.\n \"That means he\u0027s mad.\" The third man holding the baggie said, \"You won\u0027t feel it,\" but Evans did. It was a bite from the tiny beak, a single sting, almost like the sting of a needle. Evans jerked his arm and the man withdrew the baggie and sealed it again. He whispered, \"Hold him good.\"\n He went away a moment, then came back with a kitchen rag. He wiped the underside of Evans\u0027s arm, wiped the water off the floor. Still whispering, he said, \"You won\u0027t feel anything for a few minutes.\" He walked over to the phone. \"Don\u0027t try to call anybody,\" he said, and ripped the phone off the wall, smashing it on the floor.\n The men released him. They moved quickly to the door, opened it, and were gone.\n He coughed, and got to his hands and knees. He looked at his underarm; the bite looked like a dimple in the flesh, a small pink spot just at the edge of the hairs of his armpit. Nobody would ever see it.\n He did not feel anything except a sort of dull tingling at the spot where the bite had occurred. His mouth was dry, but that was probably from fear. His head hurt. He reached up, felt blood, realized that they had torn open some of his stitches.\n Jesus. He tried to get to his feet but his arm gave way, and he fell down again, rolling on the floor. He was still disoriented. He stared into the lights in the ceiling. His apartment had that cottage-cheese kind of ceiling. He hated that ceiling. He wanted to do something about it but it was too expensive. Anyway, he had always thought he would be moving soon. He was still disoriented. He got onto his elbows. His mouth was very dry now. It was the effect of the poison.\n Some kind of a toad. No, he thought, that wasn\u0027t right. It wasn\u0027t a toad. It was a amp; He couldn\u0027t remember.\n Octopus.\n That\u0027s right. It was a little octopus, hardly bigger than a thumbnail. Cute little thing.\n The Indians in the Amazon used them for poison for their arrowheads. No, he thought, that was toads. No octopus in the Amazon. Or were there?\n He was confused. Becoming more confused. He broke into a cold sweat. Was that part of it, too? He had to get to a phone. He might only have a few minutes of consciousness left.\n He crawled to the nearest object, which was an easy chair amp;he\u0027d had it in law school, it was pretty ratty, he had intended to get rid of it when he moved here but he hadn\u0027t gotten around to it yet amp;the living room needed a chair right in this spot amp;he\u0027d had it re-covered in fabric his second year in law school amp;pretty dirty now amp;who had time to go shopping? With his mind racing, he pulled himself up until his chin was resting on the seat of the chair. He was gasping for breath, it felt as if he had climbed a mountain. He thought, Why am I here? Why is my chin on the chair? Then he remembered that he was trying to climb up, to sit in it.\n Sit in the chair.\n He got the elbow of his good arm up onto the seat and began to press himself up. Finally he was able to heave his chest onto the chair, then the rest of his body. His limbs were getting numb, and cold, and heavier by the minute. They were becoming too heavy to move. His whole body was getting heavy. He managed to get himself almost upright in the chair. There was a phone on the table beside him, but his arm was too heavy to reach for it. He tried, but he could not reach out at all now. His fingers moved slightly, but that was all. His body was very cold and very heavy.\n He began to lose his balance, slowly at first and then sliding over sideways, until his chest rested on the arm of the chair and his head hung over the side. And there he stayed, unable to move. He could not lift his head. He could not move his arms. He could not even move his eyes. He stared at the fabric of the chair and the carpet on the floor and he thought, This is the last thing I will see before I die.\n Chapter 67\n VI. BLUE\n BEVERLY HILLS\n WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13\n 1:02 A.M.\n How long Peter Evans stared at the carpet he did not know. The arm of the chair pressing against his chest impeded his breathing, but it was becoming more difficult to breathe in any case. Images from his life flashed into consciousnessthe basement where he played with his first computer, the blue bicycle that was stolen the same day he got it, the boxed corsage for his senior prom date, standing up in Professor Whitson\u0027s con law class, his legs shaking, while old Whitson took him apart \"Peter? Hel-lo? Peter?\" and terrorized him, they were all terrorized by Whitson, and the dinner that was the final interview for his LA job, where he spilled soup all over his shirt and the partners pretended not to notice, and \"Peter? Peter! What are you doing there? Peter? Get up, Peter.\"\n He felt hands on his shoulders, burning hot hands, and with a grunt he was hauled back into sitting position. \"There, that\u0027s better.\" Janis peered at him, her face inches from his. \"What\u0027s the matter with you? What did you take? Talk to me.\"\n But he could not talk. He could not move at all. She was wearing a leotard top and jeans and sandals. If she moved to one side, she was out of his field of view.\n \"Peter?\" A puzzled tone. \"I think something is really wrong. Have you been doing ecstasy? Did you have a stroke? You\u0027re too young for a stroke. But it could happen, I guess. Especially with your diet. I told you no more than sixty-five grams of fat a day. If you were a vegetarian you would never have a stroke. Why don\u0027t you answer me?\"\n She touched his jaw, a questioning look on her face. Evans was feeling distinctly lightheaded because he could hardly breathe anymore. It was as if he had a twenty-ton stone on his chest. Even though he was sitting up, the great stone weighed on him.\n He thought, Call the hospital!\n \"I don\u0027t know what to do, Peter,\" she said. \"I just wanted to talk to you tonight, and now you\u0027re like this. I mean, I guess it\u0027s a bad time. But it\u0027s kind of scary, too. I have to be honest. I wish you would answer me. Can you answer me?\"\n Call the hospital!\n \"Maybe you\u0027ll hate me for this, but I don\u0027t know what you took that makes you this way, so I\u0027m going to call 911 and get an ambulance. I\u0027m really sorry and I don\u0027t want to get you into trouble, but this is freaking me out, Peter.\"\n She went out of his field of view but he heard her picking up the phone on the table next to his chair. He thought, Good. Hurry.\n She said, \"Something is wrong with your phone.\"\n Oh Jesus.\n She stepped back into his field of view. \"Your phone is not working, did you know that?\"\n Use your cell phone.\n \"Do you have your cell phone? I left mine in the car.\"\n Go get it.\n \"Maybe one of the other phones in your apartment is working. You need to call your service provider, Peter. It\u0027s not safe to be without phoneswhat\u0027s this? Somebody tore the phone out of the wall? Have we been having a fit of pique?\"\n Knocking on the door. It sounded like the front door. \"Hell-lo? Anybody here? Hello? Peter?\" A woman\u0027s voice. He couldn\u0027t see who it was.\n He heard Janis say, \"Who are you?\"\n \"Who are you?\"\n \"I\u0027m Janis. I\u0027m Peter\u0027s friend.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-46.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: \n In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
