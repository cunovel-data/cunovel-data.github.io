{"id":66381,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Chapter 5\n STANGFEDLIS\n MONDAY, AUGUST 23\n 3:02 A.M.\n Christ, it was cold, George Morton thought, climbing out of the Land Cruiser. The millionaire philanthropist stamped his feet and pulled on gloves, trying to warm himself. It was three o\u0027clock in the morning, and the sky glowed red, with streaks of yellow from the still-visible sun. A bitter wind blew across the Sprengisandur, the rugged, dark plain in the interior of Iceland. Flat gray clouds hung low over the lava that stretched away for miles. The Icelanders loved this place. Morton couldn\u0027t see why.\n In any case, they had reached their destination: directly ahead lay a huge, crumpled wall of dirt-covered snow and rock, stretching up to the mountains behind. This was Snorrajцkul, one tongue of the huge Vatnajцkull glacier, the largest ice cap in Europe.\n The driver, a graduate student, climbed out and clapped his hands with delight. \"Not bad at all! Quite warm! You are lucky, it\u0027s a pleasant August night.\" He was wearing a T-shirt, hiking shorts, and a light vest. Morton was wearing a down vest, a quilted windbreaker, and heavy pants. And he was still cold.\n He looked back as the others got out of the backseat. Nicholas Drake, thin and frowning, wearing a shirt and tie and a tweed sport coat beneath his windbreaker, winced as the cold air hit him. With his thinning hair, wire-frame glasses, and pinched, disapproving manner, Drake conveyed a scholarly quality that in fact he cultivated. He did not want to be taken for what he was, a highly successful litigator who had retired to become the director of the National Environmental Resource Fund, a major American activist group. He had held the job at NERF for the last ten years.\n Next, young Peter Evans bounced out of the car. Evans was the youngest of Morton\u0027s attorneys, and the one he liked best. Evans was twenty-eight and a junior associate of the Los Angeles firm of Hassle and Black. Now, even late at night, he remained cheerful and enthusiastic. He pulled on a Patagonia fleece and stuck his hands in his pockets, but otherwise gave no sign that the weather bothered him.\n Morton had flown all of them in from Los Angeles on his Gulfstream G5 jet, arriving in Keflavнk airport at nine yesterday morning. None of them had slept, but nobody was tired. Not even Morton, and he was sixty-five years old. He didn\u0027t feel the slightest sense of fatigue.\n Just cold.\n Morton zipped up his jacket and followed the graduate student down the rocky hill from the car. \"The light at night gives you energy,\" the kid said. \"Dr. Einarsson never sleeps more than four hours a night in the summer. None of us does.\"\n \"And where is Dr. Einarsson?\" Morton asked.\n \"Down there.\" The kid pointed off to the left.\n At first, Morton could see nothing at all. Finally he saw a red dot, and realized it was a vehicle. That was when he grasped the enormous size of the glacier.\n Drake fell into step with Morton as they went down the hill. \"George,\" he said, \"you and Evans should feel free to go on a tour of the site, and let me talk to Per Einarsson alone.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"I expect Einarsson would be more comfortable if there weren\u0027t a lot of people standing around.\"\n \"But isn\u0027t the point that I\u0027m the one who funds his research?\"\n \"Of course,\" Drake said, \"but I don\u0027t want to hammer that fact too hard. I don\u0027t want Per to feel compromised.\"\n \"I don\u0027t see how you can avoid it.\"\n \"I\u0027ll just point out the stakes,\" Drake said. \"Help him to see the big picture.\"\n \"Frankly, I was looking forward to hearing this discussion,\" Morton said.\n \"I know,\" Drake said. \"But it\u0027s delicate.\"\n As they came closer to the glacier, Morton felt a distinct chill in the wind. The temperature dropped several degrees. They could see now the series of four large, tan tents arranged near the red Land Cruiser. From a distance, the tents had blended into the plain.\n From one of the tents a very tall, blond man appeared. Per Einarsson threw up his hands and shouted, \"Nicholas!\"\n \"Per!\" Drake raced forward.\n Morton continued down the hill, feeling distinctly grouchy about being dismissed by Drake. Evans came up to walk alongside him. \"I don\u0027t want to take any damn tour,\" Morton said.\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" Evans said, looking ahead. \"It might be more interesting than we think.\" Coming out of one of the other tents were three young women in khakis, all blond and beautiful. They waved to the newcomers.\n \"Maybe you\u0027re right,\" Morton said.\n Peter Evans knew that his client George Morton, despite his intense interest in all things environmental, had an even more intense interest in pretty women. And indeed, after a quick introduction to Einarsson, Morton happily allowed himself to be led away by Eva Jуnsdуttir, who was tall and athletic, with short-cropped white blond hair and a radiant smile. She was Morton\u0027s type, Evans thought. She looked rather like Morton\u0027s beautiful assistant, Sarah Jones. He heard Morton say, \"I had no idea so many women were interested in geology,\" and Morton and Eva drifted away, heading toward the glacier.\n Evans knew he should accompany Morton. But perhaps Morton wanted to take this tour alone. And more important, Evans\u0027s firm also represented Nicholas Drake, and Evans had a nagging concern about what Drake was up to. Not that it was illegal or unethical, exactly. But Drake could be imperious, and what he was going to do might cause embarrassment later on. So for a moment Evans stood there, wondering which way to go, which man to follow.\n It was Drake who made the decision for him, giving Evans a slight, dismissive wave of his hand as he disappeared into the big tent with Einarsson. Evans took the hint, and ambled off toward Morton and the girl. Eva was chattering on about how 12 percent of Iceland was covered in glaciers, and how some of the glaciers had active volcanoes poking out from the ice.\n This particular glacier, she said, pointing upward, was of the type called a surge glacier, because it had a history of rapid advances and retreats. At the moment, she said, the glacier was pushing forward at the rate of one hundred meters a daythe length of a football field, every twenty-four hours. Sometimes, when the wind died, you could actually hear it grinding forward. This glacier had surged more than ten kilometers in the last few years.\n Soon they were joined by Бsdнs Sveinsdуttir, who could have been Eva\u0027s younger sister. She paid flattering attention to Evans, asking him how his trip over had been, how he liked Iceland, how long he was staying in the country. Eventually, she mentioned that she usually worked in the office at Reykjavнk, and had only come out for the day. Evans realized then that she was here doing her job. The sponsors were visiting Einarsson, and Einarsson had arranged for the visit to be memorable.\n Eva was explaining that although surge-type glaciers were very commonthere were several hundred of them in Alaskathe mechanism of the surges was not known. Nor was the mechanism behind the periodic advances and retreats, which differed for each glacier. \"There is still so much to study, to learn,\" she said, smiling at Morton.\n That was when they heard shouts coming from the big tent, and considerable swearing. Evans excused himself, and headed back to the tent. Somewhat reluctantly, Morton trailed after him.\n Per Einarsson was shaking with anger. He raised his fists. \"I tell you, no!\" he yelled, and pounded the table.\n Standing opposite him, Drake was very red in the face, clenching his teeth. \"Per,\" he said, \"I am asking you to consider the realities.\"\n \"You are not!\" Einarsson said, pounding the table again. \"The reality is what you do not want me to publish!\"\n \"Now, Per\"\n \"The reality,\" he said, \"is that in Iceland the first half of the twentieth century was warmer than the second half, as in Greenland.* The reality is that in Iceland, most glaciers lost mass after 1930 because summers warmed by.6 degrees Celsius, but since then the climate has become colder. The reality is that since 1970 these glaciers have been steadily advancing. They have regained half the ground that was lost earlier. Right now, eleven are surging. That is the reality, Nicholas! And I will not lie about it.\"\n \"No one has suggested you do,\" Drake said, lowering his voice and glancing at his newly arrived audience. \"I am merely discussing how you word your paper, Per.\"\n Einarsson raised a sheet of paper. \"Yes, and you have suggested some wording\"\n \"Merely a suggestion\"\n \"That twists truth!\"\n \"Per, with due respect, I feel you are exaggerating\"\n \"Am I?\" Einarsson turned to the others and began to read. \"This is what he wants me to say: The threat of global warming has melted glaciers throughout the world, and in Iceland as well. Many glaciers are shrinking dramatically, although paradoxically others are growing. However, in all cases recent extremes in climate variability seem to be the cause amp;blah amp;blah amp;blah amp;og svo framvegis.\u0027 \" He threw the paper down. \"That is simply not true.\"\n \"It\u0027s just the opening paragraph. The rest of your paper will amplify.\"\n \"The opening paragraph is not true.\"\n \"Of course it is. It refers to extremes in climate variability.\u0027 No one can object to such vague wording.\"\n \"Recent extremes. But in Iceland these effects are not recent.\"\n \"Then take out recent.\u0027\"\n \"That is not adequate,\" Einarsson said, \"because the implication of this paragraph is that we are observing the effects of global warming from greenhouse gases. Whereas in fact we are observing local climate patterns that are rather specific to Iceland and are unlikely to be related to any global pattern.\"\n \"And you can say so in your conclusion.\"\n \"But this opening paragraph will be a big joke among Arctic researchers. You think Motoyama or Sigurosson will not see through this paragraph? Or Hicks? Watanabe? Нsaksson? They will laugh and call me compromised. They will say I did it for grants.\"\n \"But there are other considerations,\" Drake said soothingly. \"We must all be aware there are disinformation groups funded by industrypetroleum, automotivewho will seize on the report that some glaciers are growing, and use it to argue against global warming. That is what they always do. They snatch at anything to paint a false picture.\"\n \"How the information is used is not my concern. My concern is to report the truth as best I can.\"\n \"Very noble,\" Drake said. \"Perhaps not so practical.\"\n \"I see. And you have brought the source of funding right here, in the form of Mr. Morton, so I do not miss the point?\"\n \"No, no, Per,\" Drake said hastily. \"Please, don\u0027t misunderstand\"\n \"I understand only too well. What is he doing here?\" Einarsson was furious. \"Mr. Morton? Do you approve of what I am being asked to do by Mr. Drake?\"\n It was at that point that Morton\u0027s cell phone rang, and with ill-concealed relief, he flipped it open. \"Morton. Yes? Yes, John. Where are you? Vancouver? What time is it there?\" He put his hand over the mouthpiece. \"John Kim, in Vancouver. Scotiabank.\"\n Evans nodded, though he had no idea who that was. Morton\u0027s financial operations were complex; he knew bankers all over the world. Morton turned and walked to the far side of the tent.\n An awkward silence fell over the others as they waited. Einarsson stared at the floor, sucking in his breath, still furious. The blond women pretended to work, giving great attention to the papers they shuffled through. Drake stuck his hands in his pockets, looked at the roof of the tent.\n Meanwhile, Morton was laughing. \"Really? I hadn\u0027t heard that one,\" he said, chuckling. He glanced back at the others, and turned away again.\n Drake said, \"Look, Per, I feel we have gotten off on the wrong foot.\"\n \"Not at all,\" Einarsson said coldly. \"We understand each other only too well. If you withdraw your support, you withdraw your support.\"\n \"Nobody is talking about withdrawing support amp;\"\n \"Time will tell,\" he said.\n And then Morton said, \"What? They did what? Deposited to what? How much money are we? Jesus Christ, John. This is unbelievable!\" And still talking, he turned and walked out of the tent.\n Evans hurried after him.\n It was brighter, the sun now higher in the sky, trying to break through low clouds. Morton was scrambling up the slope, still talking on the phone. He was shouting, but his words were lost in the wind as Evans followed him.\n They came to the Land Cruiser. Morton ducked down, using it as a shield against the wind. \"Christ, John, do I have legal liability there? I meanno, I didn\u0027t know a thing about it. What was the organization? Friends of the Planet Fund?\"\n Morton looked questioningly at Evans. Evans shook his head. He\u0027d never heard of Friends of the Planet. And he knew most of the environmental organizations.\n \"Based where?\" Morton was saying. \"San Jose? California? Oh. Jesus. What the hell is based in Costa Rica?\" He cupped his hand over the phone. \"Friends of the Planet Fund, San Josй, Costa Rica.\"\n Evans shook his head.\n \"I never heard of them,\" Morton said, \"and neither has my lawyer. And I don\u0027t rememberno, Ed, if it was a quarter of a million dollars, I\u0027d remember. The check was issued where? I see. And my name was where? I see. Okay, thanks. Yeah. I will. Bye.\" He flipped the phone shut.\n He turned to Evans.\n \"Peter,\" he said. \"Get a pad and make notes.\"\n Morton spoke quickly. Evans scribbled, trying to keep up. It was a complicated story that he took down as best he could.\n John Kim, the manager of Scotiabank, Vancouver, had been called by a customer named Nat Damon, a local marine operator. Damon had deposited a check from a company called Seismic Services, in Calgary, and the check had bounced. It was for $300,000. Damon was nervous about whoever had written the check, and asked Kim to look into it.\n John Kim could not legally make inquiries in the US, but the issuing bank was in Calgary, and he had a friend who worked there. He learned that Seismic Services was an account with a postal box for an address. The account was modestly active, receiving deposits every few weeks from only one source: The Friends of the Planet Foundation, based in San Josй, Costa Rica. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-5.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: \n In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
