The first incident we know about. The second incident will take place somewhere in the American deserteither Utah, Arizona, or New Mexico. The third incident will be somewhere in the Caribbean, east of Cuba. And the fourth incident will be in the Solomon Islands.\"\n \"Yes? So?\"\n \"Our concern right now is for the second incident,\" Kenner said. \"And the problem is that from Utah to Arizona to New Mexico there are fifty thousand square miles of desert. Unless we can get additional information, we\u0027ll never find these guys.\"\n \"But you have exact GPS locations amp;\"\n \"Which they will undoubtedly change, now that they know of the trouble in Antarctica.\"\n \"You think they have already changed plans?\"\n \"Of course. Their network knew something was wrong as soon as we arrived at Weddell yesterday. I think that\u0027s why the first guy left. I think he\u0027s actually the leader of the three. The other two were just foot soldiers.\"\n \"So you want me to go see Drake,\" Evans said.\n \"Right. And find out whatever you can.\"\n \"I hate this,\" Evans said.\n \"I understand,\" Kenner said. \"But we need you to do it.\"\n Evans looked at Sarah, who was rubbing her eyes, still sleepy. He was annoyed to see that she had arisen from her bed perfectly composed, her face uncreased, beautiful as ever. \"How are you?\" he said to her.\n \"I need to brush my teeth,\" she said. \"How long until we land?\"\n \"Ten minutes.\"\n She got up, and walked to the back of the plane.\n Evans looked out the window. The sunlight was glaring, harsh. He hadn\u0027t had enough sleep. The line of stitches in his scalp pinched. His body ached from being wedged in the damned crevasse for so long. Just to rest his elbow on the armrest of the seat was painful.\n He sighed.\n \"Peter,\" Kenner said, \"those guys tried to kill you. I wouldn\u0027t be too careful about the niceties when you fight back.\"\n \"Maybe so, but I\u0027m a lawyer.\"\n \"And you could be a dead lawyer,\" Kenner said. \"I don\u0027t advise it.\"\n It was with a sense of unreality that Peter Evans merged his hybrid car onto the San Diego freeway, twelve lanes of roaring traffic on an expanse of concrete as wide as half a football field. Sixty-five percent of the surface area of Los Angeles was devoted to cars. People had to wedge themselves in what little was left. It was an inhuman design and it was environmentally absurd. Everything was so far apart, you couldn\u0027t walk anywhere, the pollution was incredible.\n And people like Kenner did nothing but criticize the good work of environmental organizations, without whose efforts the environment of a place like Los Angeles would be much, much worse.\n Face it, he thought. The world needed help. It desperately needed an environmental perspective. And nothing in Kenner\u0027s smooth manipulation of facts would change that truth.\n His thoughts rambled on in this way for another ten minutes, until he crossed Mulholland Pass and came down toward Beverly Hills.\n He looked at the passenger seat beside him. The doctored cell phone glinted in the sunlight. He decided to take it to Drake\u0027s office right away. Get this whole thing over with.\n He telephoned Drake\u0027s office and asked to talk to him; he was told Drake was at the dentist and would return later in the day. The secretary wasn\u0027t sure exactly when.\n Evans decided to go to his apartment and take a shower.\n He parked in the garage and walked through the little garden to his apartment. The sun was shining down between the buildings; the roses were in bloom, beautiful. The only thing that marred it, he thought, was the lingering odor of cigar smoke in the air. It was offensive to think that somebody had smoked a cigar and that what remained was \"Sssst! Evans!\"\n He paused. He looked around. He could see nothing.\n Evans heard an intense whisper, like a hiss: \"Turn right. Pick a damn rose.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Don\u0027t talk, you idiot. And stop looking around. Come over here and pick a rose.\"\n Evans moved toward the voice. The cigar smell was stronger. Behind the tangle of the bushes, he saw an old stone bench that he had never noticed before. It was crusted with algae. Hunched down on the bench was a man in a sportcoat. Smoking a cigar.\n \"Who are\"\n \"Don\u0027t talk,\" the man whispered. \"How many times do I have to tell you. Take the rose, and smell it. That\u0027ll give you a reason to stay a minute. Now listen to me. I\u0027m a private investigator. I was hired by George Morton.\"\n Evans smelled the rose. Inhaling cigar smoke.\n \"I have something important for you,\" the guy said. \"I\u0027ll bring it to your apartment in two hours. But I want you to leave again, so they\u0027ll follow you. Leave your door unlocked.\"\n Evans turned the rose in his fingers, pretending to examine it. In fact, he was looking past the rose at the man on the bench. The man\u0027s face was familiar, somehow. Evans was sure he had seen him before amp; \"Yeah, yeah,\" the man said, as if reading his thoughts. He turned his lapel, to show a badge. \"AV Network Systems. I was working in the NERF building. Now you remember, right? Don\u0027t nod. For Christ\u0027s sake. Just go upstairs, change your clothes, and leave for a while. Go to the gym or whatever. Just go. These assholes\" he jerked his head toward the street \"have been waitin\u0027 for you. So don\u0027t disappoint them. Now go.\"\n His apartment had been put back together very well. Lisa had done a good jobthe slashed cushions had been flipped over; the books were back in the bookcase. They were out of order, but he would deal with that later.\n From the large windows in his living room, Evans looked out toward the street. He could see nothing except the green expanse of Roxbury Park. The kids playing at midday. The clusters of gossiping nannies. There was no sign of surveillance.\n It looked perfectly normal.\n Self-consciously, he started unbuttoning his shirt, and turned away. He went to the shower, letting the hot spray sting his body. He looked at his toes, which were dark purple, a worrisome, unnatural color. He wiggled them. He didn\u0027t have much sensation, but other than that, they seemed to be all right.\n He toweled off, and checked his messages. There was a call from Janis, asking if he was free tonight. Then another, nervous one from her, saying her boyfriend had just come back into town and she was busy (which meant, don\u0027t call her back). There was a call from Lisa, Herb Lowenstein\u0027s assistant, asking where he was. Lowenstein wanted to go over some documents with him; it was important. A call from Heather, saying that Lowenstein was looking for him. A call from Margo Lane, saying she was still in the hospital and why hadn\u0027t he called her back? A call from his client the BMW dealer, asking when he was coming to the showroom.\n And about ten hang-ups. Far more than he usually had.\n The hang-ups gave him a creepy feeling.\n Evans dressed quickly, putting on a suit and tie. He came back into the living room and, feeling uneasy, clicked on the television set, just in time for the local noon news. He was heading for the door when he heard: \"Two new developments emphasize once again the dangers of global warming. The first study, out of England, says global warming is literally changing the rotation of the Earth, shortening the length of our day.\"\n Evans turned back to look. He saw two co-anchors, a man and a woman. The man was explaining that even more dramatic was a study that showed that the Greenland ice cap was going to melt entirely away. That would cause sea levels to rise twenty feet.\n \"So, I guess it\u0027s good-bye Malibu!\" the anchor said cheerfully. Of course, that wouldn\u0027t happen for a few years yet. \"But it\u0027s coming amp;unless we all change our ways.\"\n Evans turned away from the television and headed for the door. He wondered what Kenner would have to say about this latest news. Changing the rotation speed of the Earth? He shook his head at the sheer enormity of it. And melting all the ice in Greenland? Evans could imagine Kenner\u0027s discomfiture.\n But then, he\u0027d probably just deny it all, the way he usually did.\n Evans opened the door, carefully ensured that it would remain unlocked, closed it behind him, and headed for his office.\n Chapter 44\n CENTURY CITY\n SATURDAY, OCTOBER 9\n 9:08 A.M.\n He ran into Herb Lowenstein in the hall, walking toward a conference room. \"Jesus,\" Lowenstein said, \"where the hell have you been, Peter? Nobody could find you.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been doing a confidential job for a client.\"\n \"Well next time tell your damn secretary how to reach you. You look like shit. What happened, you get in a fight or something? And what\u0027s that above your ear? Jesus, are those stitches?\"\n \"I fell.\"\n \"Uh-huh. What client were you doing this confidential job for?\"\n \"Nick Drake, actually.\"\n \"Funny. He didn\u0027t mention it.\"\n \"No?\"\n \"No, and he just left. I spent the whole morning with him. He\u0027s very unhappy about the document rescinding the ten-million-dollar grant from the Morton Foundation. Especially that clause.\"\n \"I know,\" Evans said.\n \"He wants to know where the clause came from.\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"Where did it come from?\"\n \"George asked me not to divulge that.\"\n \"George is dead.\"\n \"Not officially.\"\n \"This is bullshit, Peter. Where did the clause come from?\"\n Evans shook his head. \"I\u0027m sorry, Herb. I have specific instructions from the client.\"\n \"We\u0027re in the same firm. And he\u0027s my client, too.\"\n \"He instructed me in writing, Herb.\"\n \"In writing? Horseshit. George didn\u0027t write anything.\"\n \"Handwritten note,\" Evans said.\n \"Nick wants the terms of the document broken.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure he does.\"\n \"And I told him we\u0027d do that for him,\" Lowenstein said.\n \"I don\u0027t see how.\"\n \"Morton was not in his right mind.\"\n \"But he was, Herb,\" Evans said. \"You\u0027ll be taking ten million out of his estate and if anybody whispers in the ear of his daughter\"\n \"She\u0027s a total cokehead\"\n \"who goes through cash like a monkey through bananas. And if anybody whispers in her ear, this firm will be liable for the ten million, and for punitive damages for conspiracy to defraud. Have you talked to the other senior partners about this course of action?\"\n \"You\u0027re being obstructive.\"\n \"I\u0027m being cautious. Maybe I should express my concerns in an e-mail to you.\"\n \"This is not how you advance in this firm, Peter.\"\n Evans said, \"I think I am acting in the firm\u0027s best interest. I certainly don\u0027t see how you can abrogate this document without, at the very least, first obtaining written opinions from attorneys outside the firm.\"\n \"But no outside attorney would countenance\" He broke off. He glared at Evans. \"Drake is going to want to talk to you about this.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be happy to do that.\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell him you\u0027ll call.\"\n \"Fine.\"\n Lowenstein stalked off. Then he turned back. \"And what was all that business about the police and your apartment?\"\n \"My apartment was robbed.\"\n \"For what? Drugs?\"\n \"No, Herb.\"\n \"My assistant had to leave the office to help you with a police matter.\"\n \"That\u0027s true. As a personal favor. And it was after hours, if I recall.\"\n Lowenstein snorted, and stomped off down the hall.\n Evans made a mental note to call Drake. And get this entire business behind him.\n Chapter 45\n LOS ANGELES\n SATURDAY, OCTOBER 9\n 11:04 A.M.\n In the hot midday sun, Kenner parked his car in the downtown lot and walked with Sarah out onto the street. Heat shimmered off the pavement. The signs there were all in Spanish, except for a few English phrases\"Checks Cashed\" and \"Money Loaned.\" From scratchy loudspeakers, mariachi music blared out.\n Kenner said, \"All set?\"\n Sarah checked the small sports bag on her shoulder. It had nylon mesh at either end. The mesh concealed the video lens. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I\u0027m ready.\"\n Together, they walked toward the large store on the corner, \"Brader\u0027s Army/Navy Surplus.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-29.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: \n In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
