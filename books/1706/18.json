We will also have a number of print media people to carry the word to elite opinion makers, the ones that read but do not watch TV.\" \"Good,\" Drake said. He appeared pleased. \"Each day\u0027s theme will be identified by a distinctive graphic icon, emphasizing flood, fire, rising sea levels, drought, icebergs, typhoons, and hurricanes, and so on. Each day we have a fresh contingent of politicians from around the world coming to attend and give interviews explaining the high level of their dedication and concern about this newly emerging problem.\" \"Good, good.\" Drake nodded. \"The politicians will stay for only a daysome only a few hoursand they will not have time to attend the conferences beyond a brief photo-op showing them in the audience, but they are briefed and will be effective. Then we have local schoolchildren, grades four to seven, coming each day to learn about the dangerssorry, the catastrophein their futures, and we have educational kits for grade-school teachers, so they can teach their kids about the crisis of abrupt climate change.\" \"When do those kits go out?\" \"They were going out today, but now we\u0027ll hold them for rebannering.\" \"Okay,\" Drake said. \"And for high schools?\" \"We have some trouble there,\" the PR guy said. \"We showed the kits to a sample of high school science teachers and, uh amp;\" \"And what?\" Drake said. \"The feedback we got was they might not go over so well.\" Drake\u0027s expression turned dark. \"And why not?\" \"Well, the high school curriculum is very college oriented, and there isn\u0027t a lot of room for electives amp;\" \"This is hardly an elective amp;\" \"And, uh, they felt it was all speculative and unsubstantiated. They kept saying things like, Where\u0027s the hard science here?\u0027 Just reporting, sir.\" \"God damn it,\" Drake said, \"it is not speculative. It is happening!\" \"Uh, perhaps we didn\u0027t get the right materials that show what you are saying amp;\" \"Ah fuck. Never mind now,\" Drake said. \"Just trust me, it\u0027s happening. Count on it.\" He turned, and said in a surprised voice, \"Evans, how long have you been here?\" Peter Evans had been standing in the doorway for at least two minutes and had overheard a good deal of the conversation. \"Just got here, Mr. Drake.\" \"All right.\" Drake turned to the others. \"I think we\u0027ve gone through this. Evans, you come with me.\" Drake shut the door to his office. \"I need your counsel, Peter,\" he said quietly. He walked around to his desk, picked up some papers, and slid them toward Evans. \"What the fuck is this?\" Evans looked. \"That is George\u0027s withdrawal of support.\" \"Did you draw it up?\" \"I did.\" \"Whose idea was paragraph 3a?\" \"Paragraph 3a?\" \"Yes. Did you add that little bit of wisdom?\" \"I don\u0027t really remember\" \"Then let me refresh your memory,\" Drake said. He picked up the document and started to read. \" In the event of any claim that I am not of sound mind, there may be an attempt to obtain injunctive relief from the terms of this document. Therefore this document authorizes the payment of fifty thousand dollars per week to NERF while awaiting the judgment of a full trial. Said monies shall be deemed sufficient to pay ongoing costs incurred by NERF and shall by said payment deny injunctive relief.\u0027 Did you write this, Evans?\" \"I did.\" \"Whose idea was it?\" \"George\u0027s.\" \"George is not a lawyer. He had help.\" \"Not from me,\" Evans said. \"He more or less dictated that clause. I wouldn\u0027t have thought of it.\" Drake snorted in disgust. \"Fifty thousand a week,\" he said. \"At that rate, it will take us four years to receive the ten-million-dollar grant.\" \"That\u0027s what George wanted the document to say,\" Evans said. \"But whose idea was it?\" Drake said. \"If it wasn\u0027t you, who was it?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Find out.\" \"I don\u0027t know if I can,\" Evans said. \"I mean, George is dead now, and I don\u0027t know who he might have consulted\" Drake glared at Evans. \"Are you with us here, Peter, or not?\" He started pacing back and forth. \"Because this Vanutu litigation is undoubtedly the most significant lawsuit we have ever filed.\" He lapsed into his speech-making mode. \"The stakes are enormous, Peter. Global warming is the greatest crisis facing mankind. You know that. I know that. Most of the civilized world knows that. We must act to save the planet, before it is too late.\" \"Yes,\" Evans said. \"I know that.\" \"Do you?\" Drake said. \"We have a lawsuit, a very important lawsuit, that needs our help. And fifty thousand dollars a week will strangle it.\" Evans was sure that was not true. \"Fifty thousand is a lot of money,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t see why it should strangle\" \"Because it will!\" Drake snapped. \"Because I am telling you it will!\" He seemed surprised by his own outburst. He gripped the desk, got control of himself. \"Look,\" he said. \"We can never forget about our opponents here. The forces of industry are strong, phenomenally strong. And industry wants to be left alone to pollute. It wants to pollute here, and in Mexico, and in China, and wherever else it does its business. The stakes are huge.\" \"I understand,\" Evans said. \"Many powerful forces are taking an interest in this case, Peter.\" \"Yes, I\u0027m sure.\" \"Forces that will stop at nothing to be sure that we lose it.\" Evans frowned. What was Drake telling him? \"Their influence is everywhere, Peter. They may have influence with members of your law firm. Or other people you know. People whom you believe you can trustbut you can\u0027t. Because they are on the other side, and they don\u0027t even know it.\" Evans said nothing. He was just looking at Drake. \"Be prudent, Peter. Watch your back. Don\u0027t discuss what you are doing with anyonewith anyoneexcept me. Try not to use your cell phone. Avoid e-mail. And keep an eye out in case you are followed.\" \"Okay amp;. But actually I\u0027ve already been followed,\" Evans said. \"There\u0027s a blue Prius\" \"Those were our guys. I don\u0027t know what they are doing. I called them off days ago.\" \"Your guys?\" \"Yes. It\u0027s a new security firm we\u0027ve been trying out. They\u0027re obviously not very competent.\" \"I\u0027m confused,\" Evans said. \"NERF has a security firm?\" \"Absolutely. For years, now. Because of the danger we face. Please understand me: We are all in danger, Peter. Don\u0027t you understand what this lawsuit means if we win? Trillions of dollars that industry must pay in the coming years, to halt their emissions that are causing global warming. Trillions. With those stakes, a few lives don\u0027t matter. So: Be very damn careful.\" Evans said that he would. Drake shook his hand. \"I want to know who told George about the paragraph,\" Drake said. \"And I want that money freed up for us to use it as we see fit. This is all riding on you now,\" he said. \"Good luck, Peter.\" On his way out of the building, Evans ran into a young man who was sprinting up the stairs. They collided so hard that Evans was almost knocked down. The young man apologized hastily, and continued on his way. He looked like one of the kids working on the conference. Evans wondered what the crisis could be, now. When he got back outside, he looked down the street. The blue Prius was gone. He got into the car and drove back to Morton\u0027s, to see Sarah. Chapter 27 HOLMBY HILLS TUESDAY, OCTOBER 5 5:57 P.M. Traffic was heavy. He crept slowly along Sunset; he had plenty of time to think. The conversation with Drake left him feeling odd. There had been a funny quality to the actual meeting. As if it didn\u0027t really need to happen, as if Drake just wanted to make sure he was able to call Evans in, and Evans would come. As if he were asserting his authority. Or something like that. Anyway, Evans felt, something was off. And Evans also felt a little strange about the security firm. That just didn\u0027t seem right. After all, NERF was one of the good guys. They shouldn\u0027t be sneaking around and following people. And Drake\u0027s paranoid warnings were somehow not persuasive. Drake was overreacting, as he so often did. Drake was dramatic by nature. He couldn\u0027t help it. Everything was a crisis, everything was desperate, everything was vitally important. He lived in a world of extreme urgency, but it wasn\u0027t necessarily the real world. Evans called his office, but Heather had gone for the day. He called Lowenstein\u0027s office and spoke to Lisa. \"Listen,\" he said, \"I need your help.\" Her voice was lower, conspiratorial. \"Of course, Peter.\" \"My apartment was robbed.\" \"Noyou, too?\" \"Yes, me, too. And I really need to talk to the police\" \"Well, yes, you certainly domy goodnessdid they take anything?\" \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he said, \"but just to file a report, all thatI\u0027m kind of busy right now, dealing with Sarah amp;it may go later into the night amp;\" \"Well, of course, do you need me to deal with the police about your robbery?\" \"Could you?\" he said. \"It would help so much.\" \"Why of course, Peter,\" she said. \"Leave it to me.\" She paused. When she spoke again, it was almost a whisper. \"Is there, ah, anything you don\u0027t want the police to find?\" \"No,\" he said. \"I mean, it\u0027s all right with me, everybody in LA has a few bad habits, otherwise we wouldn\u0027t be here\" \"No, Lisa,\" he said. \"Actually, I don\u0027t have any drugs, if that\u0027s what you mean.\" \"Oh, no,\" she said quickly. \"I wasn\u0027t assuming anything. No pictures or anything like that?\" \"No, Lisa.\" \"Nothing, you know, underage?\" \"Afraid not.\" \"Okay, I just wanted to be sure.\" \"Well, thanks for doing this. Now to get in through the door\" \"I know,\" she said, \"the key is under the back mat.\" \"Yes.\" He paused. \"How\u0027d you know that?\" \"Peter,\" she said, sounding a little offended. \"You can count on me to know things.\" \"All right. Well, thanks.\" \"Don\u0027t mention it. Now, what about Margo? How\u0027s she doing?\" Lisa said. \"She\u0027s fine.\" \"You went to see her?\" \"This morning, yes, and\" \"No, I mean at the hospital. Didn\u0027t you hear? Margo was coming back from the bank today and walked in while her apartment was being robbed. Three robberies in one day! You, Margo, Sarah! What is going on? Do you know?\" \"No,\" Evans said. \"It\u0027s very mysterious.\" \"It is.\" \"But about Margo amp;?\" \"Oh yes. So I guess she decided to fight these guys, which was the wrong thing to do, and they beat her up, maybe knocked her unconscious. She had a black eye, I heard, and while the cops were there interviewing her, she passed out. Got completely paralyzed and couldn\u0027t move. And she even stopped breathing.\" \"You\u0027re kidding.\" \"No. I had a long conversation with the detective who was there. He told me it just came over her, and she was unable to move and was dark blue before the paramedics showed up and took her to UCLA. She\u0027s been in intensive care all afternoon. The doctors are waiting to ask her about the blue ring.\" \"What blue ring?\" \"Just before she became paralyzed, she was slurring her words but she said something about the blue ring, or the blue ring of death.\" \"The blue ring of death,\" Evans said. \"What does that mean?\" \"They don\u0027t know. She isn\u0027t able to talk yet. Does she take drugs?\" \"No, she\u0027s a health nut,\" Evans said. \"Well, I hear the doctors say she\u0027ll be okay. It was some temporary paralysis.\" \"I\u0027ll go see her later,\" he said. \"When you do, will you call me afterward? And I\u0027ll handle your apartment, don\u0027t worry.\" It was dark when he got to Morton\u0027s house. The security people were gone; the only car parked in front was Sarah\u0027s Porsche. She opened the front door when he rang. She had changed into a tracksuit. \"Everything all right?\" he said. \"Yes,\" she said. They came into the hallway, and they crossed to the living room. The lights were on, and the room was warm and inviting. \"Where are the security people?\" \"They left for dinner. They\u0027ll be back.\" \"They all left?\" \"They\u0027ll be back. I want to show you something,\" she said. She pulled out a wand with an electronic meter attached to it. She ran it over his body, like an airport security check. She tapped his left pocket. \"Empty it.\" The only thing in his pocket were his car keys. He dropped them on the coffee table. Sarah was running the wand over his chest, his jacket. She touched his right jacket pocket, gestured for him to empty it out. \"What\u0027s this about?\" he said. She shook her head, and didn\u0027t speak. He pulled out a penny. Set it on the counter. She waved her hand: more? He felt again. Nothing. She ran the wand over his car keys. There was a plastic rectangle on the chain, which unlocked his car door. She pried it open with a pocket-knife. \"Hey, listen amp;\" The rectangle popped open. Evans saw electronic circuits inside, a watch battery. Sarah pulled out a tiny bit of electronics hardly bigger than the tip of a lead pencil. \"Bingo.\" \"Is that what I think it is?\" She took the electronic unit and dropped it into a glass of water. Then she turned to the penny. She examined it minutely, then twisted it in her fingers. To Evans\u0027s surprise, it broke in half, revealing a small electronic center.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-18.html","bookId":1706,"book":{"id":1706,"title":"State Of Fear","description":"Storyline: In Tokyo, in Los Angeles, in Antarctica, in the Solomon Islands . . . an intelligence agent races to put all the pieces together to prevent a global catastrophe.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/state-of-fear.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
