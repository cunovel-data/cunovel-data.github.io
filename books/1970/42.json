But the threat in Micha’s eyes made him rethink it and he shied away into the crowd. When Micha aimed his gaze at me, I was thrown off by the intensity. “Go into my room and lay down, before you end up doing something you’ll regret.” “Fuck you,” I replied, hating to fight with him, but he was being possessive and it was getting on my nerves. “You’re acting like a controlling asshole.” His expression softened and he offered his hand to me. “I’m just trying to protect you from stuff. You’re drunk and you’re dressed like…” His eyes strayed up my body and then he shook his head, blinking his eyes. “Just please come lie down with me.” I snatched hold of his hand and he steered me up in front of him to walk behind me with his hands on my hips. He didn’t let go of me until we reached his room. He shut the door and he sucked on his lip ring, appearing uneasy, which was very unlike him. “Do you want one of my shirts to sleep in?” “You’re acting really, really weird.” I sat down on the bed, unfastened the strap of my shoe, and wiggled my foot out, before starting on the other one. “What’s wrong with you tonight? Did a girl blow you off or something?” “I never get upset over a girl, unless it’s you.” He released his lip ring from his teeth and began unclipping the bands on his wrists. “I think I should be the one asking you what’s wrong. I’ve never seen you dress like that.” “I’m fine.” I slipped my foot out of the shoe and turned around to climb into his bed. “I just wanted to do something different.” I turned around to get under the covers and when I faced him again, he had an amused smile on his face. “What?” I asked, pulling the blanket over me. “Why are you looking at me like that?” He signaled for me to scoot over as he slipped his shirt off. “It’s nothing. I just can’t believe you showed up wearing that.” Fuming, I rolled to my side and put my back to him. “What’s-his-face from the dance floor seemed to like it.” He got into bed with me, pressing his body closer to mine than he normal did. “I didn’t say it was a bad thing… it’s just surprising. That’s all.” He placed a hand lightly on my hip and my stomach fluttered, which it had never done before. A loud breath escaped my lips and I winced. Sealing my lips shut, I crossed my fingers he hadn’t heard it. He edged nearer, so his chest was touching my back and his warm breath feathered my skin. “Ella?” He sounded choked up. It took me a second to compose myself enough to speak. “Yeah.” The silence that followed drove me crazy. “Sweet dreams,” he finally said and kissed the back of my neck before rolling over. Looking back at the memory now, I can’t help but smile, realizing what was really going on. Stuffing the dress and shoes into my bag, I hurry downstairs and run into Caroline in the kitchen. Her black hair is sticking up all over the place and she has a set of striped pajamas on. She pours herself a cup of coffee, yawning, and when she sees me, she smiles. “Oh, I thought you were in bed,” she says. “Are you an early riser too?” I swing the bag onto my shoulder. “Not usually. This morning was just an exception.” She collects her cup of coffee and pulls out a chair at the table. “Did you want some coffee?” “Sure, why not.” Setting the bag to the floor, I pour myself a cup and join her at the table, breathing in the steam. “God, I love caffeine.” She adds some milk to her coffee and takes a gulp. “I’d like to take some pictures of you and Micha later today, if you don’t mind. I always take pictures around the holidays.” “Okay,” I say. “I have to ask Micha, but I’m sure he’ll be okay with it.” She gives a prolonged pause. “I’d like to take some of you, Dean, and your dad too.” My expression plummets as I lower my cup back to the table. “What did Dean have to say about that?” “He said he’d do it.” She gets up to put the milk in the fridge. “As long as you two agreed to it.” I strain a smile. “Alright, well, I guess that’s fine with me.” She returns to the table, appearing hesitant. “Dean’s a little different than he used to be. I think anyway. I think his therapy sessions are really helping.” She pauses to take a drink. “You know it took him forever to completely open up to me… about everything.” I stare at the cracks in the table, getting uncomfortable. “Oh.” “Don’t worry, Ella. I’m not looking to talk about it,” she says kindly. “I just wanted to let you know that he’s different and that maybe you could let him in a little more.” My gaze rises to her. “I let him in as much as he wants me to let him in.” She gathers her empty cup and sets it in the sink. “That’s not true, although he probably won’t admit it. He doesn’t really admit anything, unless you force him too—he holds a lot in.” Confusion swarms my head. “He’s always said whatever he thinks when he’s around me.” “No, he says things to push you away.” She pats my arm and then heads for the doorway, the sunlight streaming in from the window to the side of her. “But that’s something you two will need to talk about one day in the far future… when you’re both ready. In fact, you know what you should do?” “No.” And I’m not sure if I want to. “You should come stay with us for the summer,” she says, glancing over her shoulder at me. “Maybe for a few weeks.” “I’m not sure that’d be a good thing.” “Just think about it, okay?” I nod and she leaves the kitchen. After I finish my coffee, I grab my bag and head out the door and into the freezing cold, mulling over my future. Micha I’m woken up to someone sucking on my neck and the scent of vanilla. I decide I might not open my eyes and just let Ella go to town. “Rise and shine, birthday boy,” she whispers in my ear as she nips at my lobe and her leg slides over me so she’s straddling me. “No way,” I reply with my eyes shut, feeling the skin between her legs brush against my stomach. “You’re going to have to suck on a lot more things to bring me out of this deep sleep.” She laughs and slants back. I open my eyes and I’m instantly glad I did. She has on a short leather dress that barely covers up her body and high heels that match. Her auburn hair is done up with stray pieces hanging loosely around her face and her lips are stained red. “I’ve seen that outfit before.” My hands pursue her hips. “In fact, I remember that day very clearly.” “You were so mad.” She runs her finger through my hair. “I thought you were going to punch that guy on the dance floor.” “Oh, it took a lot not to,” I assure her, pressing her down against my swollen cock. “I was so pissed that he tried to touch you.” “Why, though?” she asks with curiosity. “Guys had tried to hit on me before and you never did anything.” “That’s because you usually beat me to the punch. But that night you acted like you were asking for it,” I say. “Do you know when you were climbing into bed, I got a full view of those naughty little panties you had on—they barely covered anything.” Her lips part. “Is that why you were smiling?” “Fuck yeah.” I sneak my fingers up her dress and squeeze her firm ass. “I got an eyeful and I was so turned on.” “Oh my God.” She covers her mouth with her hand, shaking her head. “That’s so embarrassing.” “Why? I’ve seen everything now. Hell, I’ve been inside you.” I jerk the top of her dress down, surprising her, and lure her breast down toward my mouth. “I’ve kissed every single part of you.” Taking her breast into my mouth, I roll my tongue along her nipple until she moans. “I had a plan,” she says, breathless. “I was going to…” She trails off, whimpering as I suck with just enough force to drive her body crazy and she quivers against me. Letting her go for a second, I slip her panties down her legs to her ankles. “Keep the dress and the heels on.” A smile touches her lips as she kicks off her panties and gradually lowers herself onto me. I meet her halfway and push into her. Her breath hitches as her head falls back and some of her hair slips out, falling along her shoulders. “Micha…” she moans as I thrust into her again. “Oh my God…” I kiss her fiercely as my hands move down her bare shoulders, along the side of her leather dress, and rest at her hips where I grab tightly ahold of her. Our skin begins to dampen with sweat as our movements start to match each other’s. When she cries out my name, with her eyes glistening, she loses it completely and I join her. Once we regain our breath, I kiss her jawline and incline away, slipping out of her. Circling my arms around her, I roll to the side, pull her close, and look into her eyes. “Best birthday present ever,” I say and gently kiss the palm of her hand, feeling the ring on her finger. “I don’t think any birthday will ever top this one.” She smiles contently. “You don’t think so?” I run my finger along the edge of the ring and it sends a rush of adrenaline through me, knowing she’s close to being mine forever. “No, I know so.” It’s late in the afternoon when we finally get out of bed. Ella complains about being sore and it makes me proud. She scowls at me when I tell her this as she puts her T-shirt on. “So what do you want to do for the rest of the day?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forever-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-2/page-42.html","bookId":1970,"book":{"id":1970,"title":"The Forever of Ella and Micha (The Secret #2)","description":"Storyline: The Forever of Ella and Micha (The Secret #2) Ella and Micha have survived tragedy and heartbreak.
