{"id":71191,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Ella busts up laughing as Ethan steps into the pool of water that surrounds the fountain and we end up having a full-on water fight. We stop only when security shows up and we run into the nearby park in our wet clothes. I’m not much of an artist, only with lyrics, but if someone were to snap a picture of us in the fountain, I’m sure they would see a rare moment of perfection. Ella I haven’t had a night like this since I was fifteen and Micha and I spent the entire day out at the lake on a small raft we “borrowed” from the neighbors. It was one of those days of simplicity, but it meant everything because there was no darkness, only light. We get a lot of glares as we walk through the lobby of the hotel in our sopping clothes, leaving a trail of water along the tile floor. The guys didn’t get their own room and apparently they’re too broke, so Lila and I decide to let them stay, even though it makes me uneasy. When we get up to the room, Micha peels off his shirt and chucks himself onto the bed, while Ethan kicks his boots off by the door. Ethan rubs his hands together. “Who’s up for a community shower?” “Are you including Micha in your request too?” I joke maliciously as I shut the bedroom door. He scowls at me, pulling a disgusted face. “Shut up.” I stick out my tongue as Micha shakes his head disappointedly. “Pretty girl, you took it one step too far.” I laugh, grabbing some pajamas out of my bag and running into the bathroom. “Since you’re the one who threw me in, you can take the shower last.” He starts to run for me and I close the door, laughing. Once I’m alone, I assess the night. I don’t understand. Why is he being so nice to me? Does he… did he figure out I was lying? I strip off my clothes and toss them in the corner, then turn on the shower, waiting until it warms up before I step in. I’m washing my hair with the hotel shampoo when the lock on the door clicks. I know who it is because he taught me how to pick a lock. “Seriously, Micha, no more for the night.” “It’s me,” Lila says and something lands on the counter with a clank. “I just needed to brush my teeth. I think I got fountain water in my mouth.” Soap stings in my eyes. “Did you pick the lock?” “No, Micha did it for me.” She turns the water on briefly, but it’s enough to make the temperature change. I shiver as I rinse the rest of the shampoo out of my hair. The sink turns off and then it turns quiet. “Lila?” I wonder if she left. “Are you ever planning on telling him the truth?” Lila finally asks. “That you didn’t cheat on him, but that you had a…” “Nervous breakdown—you can say it.” My hands remain in my hair and soap drips down my face. “And I don’t know if I’m going to tell him.” I hear her sit down on top of the toilet. “Can I ask why not?” Swallowing hard, I peek out from the curtain. “Because he seems happy, and if he is, then I don’t want to ruin it for him. That’s all I’ve ever wanted for him.” She sighs heavy-heartedly. “Ella, when are you going to realize that you two belong together? Everyone who lays eyes on you can see it and is envious of it because that kind of love isn’t supposed to exist.” I wipe some water from my face. “What kind of love are you talking about?” “The kind of love that owns you.” She gets up, gives a quick look in the mirror, and combs her fingers through her damp hair. “The kind where you know the other person inside and out. Where you can go through hell and back and still make it out okay.” She leaves me alone with her heavy words echoing in my head. I shut off the water and climb out of the shower. After I’m dressed, I exit the bathroom with my hands crossed over my chest, because I forgot to grab a clean bra. Micha is leaning against the headboard with his shirt and shoes off, and the remote pointed at the television. His eyes connect with mine and a smile curls at his lips. “Why are you crossing your arms like that, pretty girl,” he says with a mischievous sparkle in his eyes. I lie flat on my stomach on the bed next to his. “Where’re Lila and Ethan?” “They went to raid the vending machine.” His eyes roam across my body and my skin tingles as my breath catches. “So it’s just you and me.” I press my lip together to hide the sound of my erratic breathing. “So it is.” He slides his legs off the bed and he studies me momentarily. “I should probably take a shower.” He has a look on his face like he’s enjoying himself. Without saying another word, he gets some clothes out of his bag on the floor and struts off to the bathroom, doing that sexy walk he does when he knows someone is watching him. I end up passing out and when I wake up, the room is dark and soundless. The blankets are pulled over me and someone’s warm breath is dusting my cheeks. I was under the impression that I’d be sharing a bed with Lila, but I hope the warm body sleeping very close to me isn’t hers. “Are you awake?” Micha whispers and his breath tickles my cheek. I let my eyes adjust to the dark and make out the outline of his face. “Kind of.” I hear him sucking on his lip ring. “I can’t sleep. I have too much pent-up energy.” “Over what?” I utter quietly. “Over you,” he says in a low voice. “And the fact that you’re sleeping only inches away without a bra on and all I want to do is touch you. It’s driving me crazy.” “How can you want to touch me after what I did?” “How can I ever not want to touch you?” His words confuse me in the strangest way, but I crave his touch, so slowly, I hitch my leg over his hip. His breathing hitches and then the palm of his hand slides up my bare leg, leaving a trail of heat along my skin. He doesn’t say a word as his hand sneaks up the side of my shorts, scoots my panties to the side, and seconds later his fingers are inside me. My teeth clamp down on my lip as he starts to feel me thoroughly. It’s like we’re doing something forbidden in the dark room with Ethan and Lila only a few feet away. His mouth fumbles against my lips as his warm tongue urges them apart. He keeps moving his fingers inside me as he nips at my lip and feels my breasts with his free hand, rubbing his thumb along my nipple, driving my body crazy. “Micha…” I groan. “Shh…” he murmurs against my lips. He continues to suffocate me with his kisses until he pushes me over the edge. Clutching onto him, my head tips back and I try to breathe through it quietly. When I recompose myself, he kisses my forehead and slips his finger out of me. “Now I can sleep,” he whispers, and within minutes, his breathing becomes calm. I’m left wide-awake and I have a feeling he did it on purpose. Chapter 8 Micha I wake up feeling good. The sun is shining through the window and my mind is calm and relaxed. I know it was a dirty move to get back at her, but it wasn’t like it was a punishment for her either. I just left her wide awake, hot and bothered, a feeling I’m becoming very familiar with. I sit up, rub my eyes, and realize Ella and Lila are missing from the room. “Well, good morning, princess,” Ethan says from the table. He’s eating a doughnut and has an energy drink in his hand. “Did you have a good night’s rest?” “Where is everyone?” I climb out of bed and slip on a black T-shirt. He stuffs the rest of the doughnut into his mouth and dusts the crumbs off his hands on the front of his jeans. “The alarm didn’t go off so they ran out of here about ten minutes ago, freaking out about not having enough time to get their hair done. Or at least that’s what Lila was saying… Ella seemed a little distracted.” I eye him over as I search through my bag for my watch. “Are you insinuating something? Because you have this stupid look on your face and it’s getting on my nerves.” He sips his drink and pushes up from the chair. “Only that the next time you two fool around in the dark with other people in the room, you might want to try being a little bit quieter.” “Do me a favor,” I say, “don’t say anything to Ella. You’re gonna make things weird.” “Weirder than you two already made them?” He crushes the can and shoots it into the trashcan in the corner. “Because those noises from last night are going to haunt my nightmares for a long time.” I change the subject, clipping my watch onto my wrist. “What the heck are we supposed to wear to a wedding?” “How the hell should I know?” He glances down at his long-sleeve black shirt pulled over a gray T-shirt and his dark jeans. “I was going to go like this.” Grabbing a black pinstriped shirt and a pair of my nicest jeans, I head off to the bathroom. “Has she admitted she was lying?” Ethan flips on the television and flops down on one of the beds, crossing his feet. I halt in the doorway and glance over my shoulder at him. “No… As usual, she’s being stubborn.” “Here’s a thought.” He drops the remote on the nightstand. “You could always tell her you know and save yourself all the drama.” “It’s not that simple,” I explain. “I don’t like to push her into doing things… because…” I trail off, knowing I can’t tell him about the bridge or how she looked on that bathroom floor when she told me. When she’s ready, she’ll tell… at least I hope. But what if she doesn’t? What if I’ve spent my life chasing a ghost? “Okay, so I’m severely disappointed in the bridesmaid lineup,” Ethan comments, eyeballing the bridesmaids standing just outside the canopy entrance. We are sitting in the back row waiting for this little shindig to start while people scurry back and forth through the tent. The front of the area is decorated with purple flowers and the main aisle is lined with black and purple ribbons.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forever-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-2/page-14.html","bookId":1970,"book":{"id":1970,"title":"The Forever of Ella and Micha (The Secret #2)","description":"Storyline: The Forever of Ella and Micha (The Secret #2) Ella and Micha have survived tragedy and heartbreak.
