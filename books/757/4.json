{"id":21242,"no":4,"title":"ADVICE TO TO LOVELORN","content":"I MISS ANN AUSTIN came briskly into her little cupboard of a room at the back of the Evening Planet office. She hung up her hat and coat, opened her rolltop desk, put her small handbag carefully in a drawer, and looked at herself in a greenish mirror that hung secretly on a hook in the recess under the pigeonholes. She took the rubber hood off her typewriter, poured three paper cupfuls of drinking water on the potted geranium on the windowledge, wound up the cheap clock on top of the desk, and moved it forward ten minutes to compensate for what it had lost during the night. Now she was ready for work. As she wound up the clock, the usual thought occurred to her—when would she be able to buy herself the handsome little wrist watch she coveted? There were a lot of them in the jeweller\u0027s shop on Park Row, and she admired them every morning on her way to the office. But when one is supporting one\u0027s self and an invalid mother in an uptown apartment, and has to pay for a woman to come in during the day to lend a hand, all on fifty dollars a week, in an era of post-bellum prices, wrist watches have to wait. However, as Ann made the daily correction in her laggard clock she used to say to herself: “There\u0027s a better time coming.” She was not devoid of humour, you see. Then the office boy would bring in the big pile of morning mail, grinning as he laid it on the pullout slide of her desk. He may be excused for grinning, because Ann was the kind of creature who would bring a smile to the surliest face. She was just a nice size, with a face that was both charming and sensible, and merry brown eyes (when it wasn\u0027t too close to the first of the month). Also, that pile of mail was rather amusing. Those letters, so many of them written on cheap pink or blue stationery and addressed in unsophisticated handwriting, were not directed to Miss Ann Austin, but to “Cynthia,” and the office boy knew pretty well the kind of messages that were in them. For Ann, under the pseudonym of “Cynthia,” conducted the Planet\u0027s department of Advice to the Lovelorn, and daily several score of puzzled or distracted beings bared their hearts to her. The pile of letters was growing bigger, too. The Planet, which was not a very flourishing paper just at that time, had started the Advice to the Lovelorn department a few months before, and had put Ann in charge of it because she had done so well writing sob stories. It was beginning to “pull” quite surprisingly as a circulation feature, especially since her smiling little picture, vignetted in a cut with a border of tiny hearts, had been put at the head of the column. Under the cut was the legend: “Cynthia, a Sympathetic Adviser in Matters of the Heart.” Ann didn\u0027t know whether to be pleased or not at the growing popularity of her feature. This was not quite the kind of thing she had hoped for when she entered the newspaper world. But—the more letters there were from the lovelorn, the sooner she might get that needed raise. With a little sigh she got out her penknife, began slitting the envelopes, ceased to be Ann Austin and became Cynthia, the sage and gentle arbiter over her troubled parliament of love. It was a task that required no small discretion and tact, because Cynthia, whatever her private misgivings, tried to perform it with some honest idealism. In the first place, the letters that were obviously merely humorous, or were amorous attempts to inveigle her into private correspondence, were discarded. Then the letters to be used in the next day\u0027s column had to be selected, and laid aside to be printed with her comment on the ethical or sociological problems involved. The remaining letters had all to be answered, and data noted down that would be useful in compiling the pamphlet “1001 Problems of Courtship” that the managing editor insisted on her preparing. He said it would be great circulation dope. Ann didn\u0027t care much for the managing editor, Mr. Sikes. He had a way of coming into her room, closing the door behind him, leaning over her desk, and saying: “Well, how\u0027s little Miss Cupid?” If it hadn\u0027t been for that habit of his, Ann would have spoken to him about a raise before now. But she had an uneasy feeling that it would not be pleasing to put herself in the position of asking him favours. She would have been still more disturbed if she had known that some of the boys in the city room used to talk about “Cupid and Sikey” when they saw him visit her room. They said it angrily, because Ann was a general office favourite. Even the coloured elevator man had brought his wooing problems to her one day, wanting to be reassured as to his technique. It is all very well for you to scoff, superior reader, but letters such as Ann had to read every morning bring an honest pang to an understanding heart; particularly when that heart is in collaboration with twenty-two years of bright, brown-eyed, high-spirited girlhood. Perhaps you don\u0027t realize how many of us are young and ignorant and at work in offices, and absorbed, out of working hours, in the universal passion. A good many make shift to be cynical and worldly-wise in public, but who knows how ravishingly sentimental we are in private? Some say that Doctor Freud didn\u0027t tell the half of it. As that waggish poet Keith Preston has remarked, Love, lay thy phobias to rest, Inhibit thy taboo! We twain shall share, forever blest, A complex built for two! A complex built for two was the ambition of most of Ann\u0027s correspondents; but mainly her letters exhibited the seamy side of Love\u0027s purple mantle. You see, when lovers are perfectly happy, they don\u0027t write to the papers about it. And when she pondered gravely over “Brokenhearted\u0027s” letter saying that she has just learned that a perfectly splendid fellow she is so infatuated with has a wife and three children in Detroit; or over “Puzzled\u0027s” inquiry as to whether she is “a bum sport” because she wouldn\u0027t let the dark young man kiss her good-night, she sometimes said to herself that Napoleon was right. Napoleon, you remember, remarked that Love causes more unhappiness than anything else in the world. And then she would turn to her typewriter, and put under “Puzzled\u0027s” inquiry: No, “Puzzled,” do not let him kiss you unless you are betrothed. If any one is a “bum sport” it is he for wanting to do so. If he “always kisses the girls good-night when he has had a good time,” he is not your sort. A man that does not respect a girl before marriage will certainly not respect her afterward. After she had typed these replies she always hastily took the paper out of her typewriter and tucked it away in her desk. She did not like the idea of Mr. Sikes coming in and reading it over her shoulder, as he had done once. That was the time she had used the quotation “Pains of Love are sweeter far than all other pleasures are” in answering “Desolate.” The managing editor had repeated the verse in a way that both angered and alarmed her. This particular morning, among the other letters was one that interested her both by the straightforward simplicity of its statement and by the clear, vigorous handwriting on sensible plain notepaper. It ran thus: Dear Cynthia: I am a young business man, very much in love, and I need your help. I have fallen in love with a girl who does not know me. I do not even know her name but I know her by sight, and I know where she works. She looks like the only one for me, but I don\u0027t want to do anything disrespectful. Would it be a mistake for me to call at her office and try to get a chance to meet her? Do you think she would be offended? She looks very adorable. Please tell me honestly what you think. Respectfully yours, Sincerity. Wearied by the maunderings of many idiotic flappers and baby vamps, this appeal attracted her. She put it into the column for the following day, writing underneath it: You never can tell, “Sincerity”! It all depends upon you. If you are the right kind of man, she ought not to be offended. Why not take a chance? Faint heart never won fair lady. It was trying enough, Ann used to think, to have to pore over the troubles of her lovelorn clients on paper; but the worst times were when they came to call on her at the office. Fortunately this did not happen very often, for the stricken maidens and young Lochinvars who make up the chief support of such columns as hers are safely and busily shut up among typewriters and filing cases during the daytime; their wounds do not begin to burn intolerably until about five-thirty p.m. But now and then some forlorn and baffled creature would find his or her way to “Cynthia” and ask her advice. She would listen sympathetically, apply such homely febrifuge as her inexperienced but wise heart suggested to her, and after the patient had gone she would add the case to her list of 1001 Problems. The material for the pamphlet was growing rapidly. One morning, while the managing editor was in her room asking her how soon the booklet would be ready, the office boy brought in a card neatly engraved Mr. Arthur Caldwell. Now as a rule Cynthia did not see masculine visitors, because (after one or two trying experiences) she had found that they were inclined to transfer to her the heart that someone else had bruised. But in this case she welcomed the caller because Mr. Sikes was being annoyingly facetious. He had looked over her laboriously gathered data for the 1001 Problems, and had said: “Well, you\u0027re getting to be quite an experienced little girl in these matters, hey?” He had seemed disposed to linger on the topic with pleasure. Therefore Cynthia told the office boy to send Mr. Caldwell in, though the name meant nothing to her. Mr. Sikes went out, and the caller was introduced. Mr. Caldwell proved to be a young man, quite as nice-looking as the collar-advertising young men without being so desperately handsome. Cynthia liked him from the first glance. There was something that seemed very genuine about his soft collar and his candid, clean-shaven face and the little brown brief-case he carried. He had on brown woollen socks, too, she noticed, in one of those quick feminine observations. He seemed very embarrassed, and his face suddenly went ruby red. “Is this Cynthia?” he said. “Yes,” said Ann, pushing aside a mass of lovelorn correspondence, and wondering what the trouble could be. “My name\u0027s Caldwell,” he said. “Look here, I suppose you\u0027ll think me an awful idiot, but I wanted to ask your advice. I—I wrote you a letter the other day, and your answer in the column made me think that perhaps you wouldn\u0027t mind giving me some help. I wrote that letter signed \u0027Sincerity\u0027.” He was obviously ill at ease, and Ann tried to help him out. “I remember the letter perfectly,” she said. “Did you take my advice?” “Well, I\u0027m a bit uncertain about it,” he said. “I just wanted to explain to you a little more fully, and see what you think. You see I happened to see this girl one day, going into her office. I suppose the idea about love at first sight is all exploded, but I had a hunch as soon as I saw her that——Oh, well, that I would like to know her. I\u0027ve seen her going in and out of the building, but she has never seen me, never even heard of me. I don\u0027t know any one who can introduce me to her, and I can\u0027t just walk up to her and tell her I\u0027m crazy about her. They don\u0027t do that except in Shakespeare. I don\u0027t know much about girls and I thought maybe you could suggest some way in which I could meet her without frightening her.” Ann pondered. She liked the young man\u0027s way of putting his problem, and it was plain from his genuine embarrassment that he was sincere. “I\u0027d love to help you, if I could,” she said. “It seems to me that the only way to go about it is to arrange some business with the firm she works for, and try to meet her that way. Couldn\u0027t that be done?” “She\u0027s secretary to one of the big bugs in the Telephone Company,” he said. “I\u0027m in the publishing business. I don\u0027t see any way in which I could fake up a business connection there. The worst of it is, there may be a dozen fellows in love with her already, for all I know. I suppose I might get a job with the Telephone Company, but by the time I had worked up far enough to have an excuse for going into the vice-president\u0027s office where she works, someone else might have married her.” He laughed, a boyish, ingratiating chuckle. “It does seem pretty hard,” said Ann. “I don\u0027t know what to say.” She had a mental picture of the unknown fair one, going in and out of the big Telephone Company\u0027s building on Dey Street, unaware of the admiring glances of this bashful admirer. “I\u0027ll bet the men she knows aren\u0027t half as nice as he is,” she said to herself. “I happen to know that she reads your column,” said Caldwell. “I suppose there isn\u0027t any way I could get in touch with her through that?” “If there\u0027s any legitimate way I can help,” Ann said, “I\u0027ll be glad to. But I hardly see what I can do.” “Well, thanks awfully,” he said. “If I get a chance to meet her, will you let me come in again and tell you about it? Perhaps you would let me mention your name as a reference, in regard to my respectability I mean?” “Surely you can give her better references than that? You see, I don\u0027t know so very much about you, Mr. Caldwell.” “In matters like this,” he said, “I guess you\u0027re the Big Authority. And by the way, do you ever do any book reviewing? I work for Fawcett and Company, the publishers, and we\u0027d like immensely to have your comment on some of our love stories. Can I send you some books?” “I can\u0027t promise to review them,” said Ann, rather pleased, because this seemed to her a way to earn a little extra money. “But I\u0027ll speak to the literary editor, and we\u0027ll see.” “Suppose I send them to your home address,” said Caldwell. “I know what a newspaper office is, if I send them here someone else might snitch them. Give me your street number, and you\u0027ll be spared the trouble of taking them home to read.” “That\u0027s very kind of you,” said Ann. “Miss Ann Austin, 527 West 150th Street. Well, you let me know what happens about your fair lady. I wish you all sorts of luck!” When Arthur Caldwell got outside the office, he looked down Park Row to where the great Telephone Building rose up behind the brown silhouette of St. Paul\u0027s. “Caldwell,” he said to himself, “you\u0027re an infernal liar! But it pays! I\u0027ll figure out some way. While there\u0027s life there\u0027s dope.” He set out for the subway, but paused again to meditate. “Ann Austin!” he said. “By George, she\u0027s a queen.” II It is not the purpose of this tale to tell in detail how Arthur Caldwell laid siege to Ann Austin. He was a cautious man, and for some time he contented himself by presenting occasional reports of his progress with the damsel of the Telephone Company. Ann, in her friendly and unselfish way, was delighted to hear, a few days later, that he had met his ideal. Then, averring that he needed further counsel, Arthur persuaded her to have lunch with him one day; and Ann, convinced that the young man was in love with someone else, saw no reason why this should not be done. Perhaps it was a little odd that at their various meetings they should have talked so much of themselves, their ambitions, the books they had been reading, and so on; and so little of the Telephone lady. But surely it was strictly a matter of business that Arthur should send Miss Austin some of Fawcett\u0027s novels, for her to review in the Planet; and equally a professional matter that he should discuss with her her opinion of them. And then came the day when Arthur called up to say that things were going so well with the Telephone lady that he wanted Cynthia to meet her; and would she join them in St. Paul\u0027s Churchyard at half-past twelve? Ann, with just a curious little unanalyzed twinge in her heart, agreed to do so. But when she reached the bench in the graveyard, where a bright autumn sunshine filled the clearing among those tremendous buildings, Arthur was there alone. “Where\u0027s Alice?” said Ann, innocently—for such was the name Arthur had always given the lady of the Telephone Company. “She couldn\u0027t come,” he said. “But I want to show you her picture.” They sat down on the bench, and he took out of his pocket a copy of the noon edition of the Planet. He turned to the feature page, and displayed the little cut of Cynthia at the head of the Lovelorn column. “There,” he said, stoutly (though his heart was tremulous within him), “there, you adorable little thing, there she is.” It would be pleasant to linger over this scene, but, as I have just said, this is not our denouement, but only an incident. Ann, shot through with delicious pangs of doubt and glory and anger, asked for explanations. “And do you mean to say there never was any Alice, the beautiful Telephone blonde?” she said. “What a fraud you are!” “Of course not,” he said. “You dear, delightful innocent, I just had to cook up some excuse for coming up to see you. And you can\u0027t be angry with me now, Ann, because in your own answer to Sincerity\u0027s letter you said the girl ought not to be offended. You told me to take a chance! Just think what self-control I had, that first time I came up to see you, not to blurt out the truth.” And then he tore off a scrap of margin from the newspaper and measured her finger for a ring. III There were happy evenings that winter, when Ann, after finishing her stint at the office, would hasten up their rendezvous at Piazza\u0027s little Italian table d\u0027hote. Here, over the minestrone soup and the spaghetti and that strong Italian coffee that seems to have a greenish light round the edges of the liquid (and an equally greenish taste), they would discuss their plans and platitudes, just as lovers always have and always will. As for Ann, the light of a mystical benevolence shone in her as she conned her daily pile of broken hearts in the morning mail. More than ever she felt that she, who had seen the true flame upon the high altar, had a duty to all perplexed and random followers of the gleam who had gone astray in their search. Aware more keenly that the troubled appeals of “Tearful” and “Little Pal,” however absurd, were the pains of genuine heartache, she became more and more tender in her comments, and her correspondence grew apace. Now that she knew that her job need not go on forever she tried honestly to run the column with all her might. How stern she was with the flirt and the vamp and the jilt; how sympathetic with the wounded on Love\u0027s great battle-field. “Great stuff, great stuff!” Mr. Sikes would cry, in his coarse way, and complimented her on the increasing “kick” of her department. Knowing that he attributed the accelerated pulse of the Lovelorn column to mere cynicism on her part, she did not dare wear her ring in the office for fear of being joked about it. She used to think sadly that because she had made sympathy with lovers a matter of trade, she herself, now she was in love, could hope for no understanding. Although she hardly admitted it, she longed for the day when she could drop the whole thing. One evening Arthur met her at Piazza\u0027s, radiant. He was going off on a long business trip for his publishing house, and they had promised him a substantial raise when he returned. They sat down to dinner together in the highest spirits. Arthur, in particular, was in a triumphant mood: the publishing world, it seemed, lay under his feet. “Great news, hey?” he said. “We\u0027ll be able to get married in the spring, and you can kick out of that miserable job.” “But, Arthur,” she said, “you know I have to take care of Mother. Don\u0027t you think it would be wiser if I went on with the work for a while, until your next raise comes? It would help a good deal, and we\u0027d be able to put a little away for a rainy day.” “What?” he said. “Do you think I\u0027m going to have my wife doing that lovelorn stuff in the paper every day? It\u0027d make me a laughing stock if it ever got out. No, sir! I haven\u0027t said much about it, because I knew it couldn\u0027t be helped; but believe me, honey, that isn\u0027t the right kind of job for you. I\u0027ve often wondered you didn\u0027t feel that yourself.” Ann was a little nettled that he should put it that way. Whatever her private distaste for the Lovelorn column, it had served her well in a difficult time, and had paid the doctor\u0027s bills at home. And she knew how much honest devotion she had put into the task of trying to give helpful counsel. “At any rate,” she said, “it was through the column that we first met.” What evil divinity sat upon Arthur\u0027s tongue that he could not see this was the moment for a word of tenderness? But a young man flushed with his first vision of business success, the feeling that now nothing can prevent him from “making good,” is likely to be obtuse to the finer shades of intercourse. “Of course, dear, I could see you were different from the usual sob sister of the press,” he said. “I could see you didn\u0027t really fall for that stuff. It\u0027s because I love you so, I want to get you out of that cheap, degrading sensational work. Most of those letters you get are only fakes, anyway. I think Love ought to be sacred, not used as mere circulation bait for a newspaper.” Ann was a high-spirited girl, and this blunt criticism touched her in that vivid, quivering region of the mind where no woman stops to reason. But she made an honest attempt to be patient. “But, Arthur,” she said; “there\u0027s nothing really cheap and degraded in trying to help others who haven\u0027t had the same advantages we have. I know a lot of the letters I print are silly and absurd, but not more so than some of the books you publish.” “Now, listen,” he said, loftily, “we won\u0027t quarrel about this. I don\u0027t want you to go on with the job, that\u0027s all. It isn\u0027t fair to you. You may take the work seriously, and put all sorts of idealism into it, but it\u0027s not the right kind of job for a refined girl. How about the men in the office? I\u0027ll bet I know what they think of it. They probably think it\u0027s a devil of a good joke, and laugh about it among themselves. Don\u0027t you think I\u0027ve seen that managing editor leering at you? That sort of thing cheapens a girl among decent men. Every Lovelace in town feels he has a right to send you mash-notes, I guess.” Ann was furious. “Well, you\u0027re the only one I ever paid any attention to,” she said, blazing at him. “I\u0027m sorry you think I\u0027ve cheapened myself. I guess I have, by letting you interfere with my affairs.” She slipped the ring from her finger, and thrust it at him. Arthur saw, too late, what he had done. She listened in scornful silence to his miserable attempts to console her, which were doubly handicapped by the old waiter hovering near. She was still adamant while he took her up town. The only thing she said was when she reached the door of her apartment. “I don\u0027t want you to cheapen yourself. You needn\u0027t come any more.” By this time Arthur also was thoroughly angry. The next morning he went away on his business trip, realizing for the first time that he who has the pass key to a human heart treads among dangerous explosives. IV How different the little room in the Planet office looked to Ann when she returned, with a sick heart, to her work the next morning. Everything was just the same—the geranium on its windowledge, that seemed to survive both the eddying hot air from the steampipes beneath it and the daily douche of iced drinking water; the noisily ticking inaccurate little clock; the dusty typewriter. All were the same, and there was the pile of morning letters from Love\u0027s battered henchmen. To office boy and casual reporter Ann herself seemed the usual cheerful charmer with her crisp little white collar and dark, alluring hair. Her swift, capable hands sped over the pile of letters, slitting the envelopes and sorting the outcries into some classification of her own. Outwardly nothing had altered, but everything seemed to have lost its meaning. What a desolate emptiness gaped beneath the firm routine of her daily life. She was struck by the irony of the fact that the only one in the office who seemed to notice that something was amiss was the one person whom she disliked—Mr. Sikes. He came in about something or other, and then stayed, looking at her intently. “You look sick,” he said. “What\u0027s the matter, is the love feast getting on your nerves?” With a queer twitching at the corners of her mouth, she forced herself to say some trifling remark. He leaned over her and put his hand on hers. She caught the strong cigarry whiff of his clothes, which sickened her. “Too much love in the abstract,” he said, insinuatingly. “What you need is a little love in the concrete.” If he—or any one—had spoken tenderly to her, she would have burst into tears. But the boorishness of his words was just the tonic she needed. She looked at him with flashing eyes, and was about to say: “Keep to some topic you understand.” Then she dared not say it, for now she could not run the risk of losing her job. She faced him steadily, in angry silence. He left the room, and the little green-tarnished mirror under the pigeonholes saw tears for the first time. The irony of her position moved her cruelly when she began her task of dealing with the correspondents. Here she was, giving helpful, cheery advice, posing as all-wise in these matters, when her own love affair had come so miserably to grief. In the ill-written scrawls on scented and scalloped paper she could hear an echo of her own suffering. “Hopeless” and “Uncertain” and “Miss Eighteen” got very tender replies that day. And how she laid the lash upon “Beau Brummel” and “Disillusioned,” those self-assured young men, who had chosen that mail to contribute their views on the flirtatious and unreliable qualities of modern girls. The bitterness of her paradoxical task became dulled as the days went on, but there were other troubles, too, to bother her. Her mother, quick and querulous to detect unhappiness, fell into one of her nervous spells, and the doctor had to be called in again. The woman-by-the-day got blood-poisoning in her arm, and could not come. The landlord gave notice of a coming raise in rent. A fat letter came from Arthur, and in a flush of passion she destroyed it unread. If it hadn\u0027t been such a fat letter, she said to herself, it wouldn\u0027t have annoyed her so to see it. But she wasn\u0027t going to wade through pages of explanation of just what he had meant. She was still cut to the quick when she remembered the cavalier and easy way in which he had scoffed at her work. And then, as time went by, she found herself moving into a new mood—no longer one of exaggerated tenderness toward her clients, but a feeling almost cynical. “They\u0027re all fools, just as I am,” she said. One morning she found on her desk a note from the managing editor: Dear Miss Cupid: We\u0027ve made some changes in our budget, and I\u0027ve been authorized to fatten your envelope $15 a week. I\u0027m glad to do this, because the Lovelorn stuff is going big. Just keep kidding them along and everything will be fine. Maybe some day we can syndicate it. Hope this will cheer you up, don\u0027t look so blue at your friends. Sikes. There had been a time when the tone and phrasing of this note might have seemed offensive, but in the numbness of despondency Ann had felt lately, it was a fine burst of rosy warmth. Thank God, she said to herself, something has broken my way at last! She wondered if she had been mistaken in Sikes, after all? Perhaps he was really a friend of hers, and she had misunderstood his odd ways. That day at noon she went down to the cashier\u0027s department to cash a small check. There was no one in the cage, but in the adjoining compartment, behind a wall of filing cases, she could hear two girls talking. One of them said: “I see Sikes has put through a raise for Lovelorn. Pretty soft for her, hey?” “She\u0027ll have to give value received, I guess,” said the other. “Sikes figures if he puts that over for her, she\u0027ll fall for him. She\u0027s been stalling him for quite a while, but I suppose he\u0027s got her fixed now.” She fled, aghast, ran down to another floor so as not to be seen, and took the elevator. Out on the street she walked mechanically along Park Row and found herself opposite St. Paul\u0027s. She wandered in and sat down on a bench. It was a chilly day, and the churchyard was nearly empty. So this was Sikes\u0027s friendliness; and she, utterly innocent even in thought, was already the subject of vulgar office gossip. For the first time there broke in upon her, with bitter force, the knowledge that no matter how easy it may be to counsel others, few of us are wise in our own affairs. Pitiable paradox: she, the “sympathetic adviser in matters of the heart,” had made shipwreck of her own happiness. How right Arthur had been, and how childish and mad she, to reject his just instinct. It was true: she had made use of Love for mere newspaper circulation; and now Love had died between her hands. Well, this was the end. No matter what happened, she could not go on with the job. Cold and trembling with nervousness, she returned to her desk, to finish her column for the next day. On her typewriter lay some letters, which had come in while she was out. She opened one, and read. Dear Cynthia: I am in great trouble, please help me. I am in love with a fellow and know he is all right and we would be very happy together. We were engaged to be married, and everything was lovely. But he objected to the work I was doing, said it was not a good job for a girl and that I ought to give it up. I knew he was right, but the way he said it made me mad. I guess I am hot-tempered and stubborn—anyway, I told him to mind his own business, and he went away. Now I am heart-broken, because I love him and I know he loves me. Tell me what to do. Jessie. Ann sat looking at the cheap blue paper with the initial J gaudily embossed upon it in gilt. In the sprawling lines of unlettered handwriting she saw an exact parallel to her own unhappy rupture with Arthur. How much more clearly we can see the answer in others\u0027 tangles than in our own! Jessie, with her pathetic pretentious gilt initial, knew that she had been in the wrong, and was brave enough to want to make amends. And she—had she not been less true to Love than Jessie? Her false pride and obstinacy had brought their own punishment. Seeing the situation through Jessie\u0027s eyes, she could read her duty plain. Arthur, no doubt, was through with her forever, but she must play the game no less. She put Jessie\u0027s letter at the head of the Lovelorn column for the next day. Under it she wrote: Certainly, dear Jessie, if you feel you were in the wrong, you ought to take the first step toward making up. Probably he was tactless in criticizing you, but I am sure he only did it because he had your true interest at heart. So write him a nice letter and be happy together. Your friend Cynthia hopes it will all come out all right, because she has seen other cases like this where false pride caused great suffering. If he is the right man, he will love you all the more after he gets your letter. Ann sent up her copy to the composing room, and then going to a telephone booth she called up Fawcett and Company and asked for Mr. Caldwell. “Mr. Caldwell\u0027s not here any longer,” said the girl. “Serves me right,” said Ann to herself. “Can you tell me where I can find him?” she asked, wondering how it was that one so miserable could still speak in such a pleasant and apparently unconcerned tone of voice. The Fawcett operator switched her to another wire. “I\u0027m sorry,” said a stenographer, “Mr. Fawcett left here about two weeks ago. He\u0027s got a job out of town—in Boston, I think. I can find out for you in the morning if you\u0027ll call again.” “Never mind,” said Ann. She had a horror of facing Mr. Sikes in her present wretchedness, so before she went home she wrote him a note, resigning her job, and asking permission to leave as soon as possible. The next day she had to nerve herself to face his protests, and the friendly remarks of all the staff when the news spread. It was a hideous ordeal, but she managed to get through it smiling. But by evening she was inwardly a wreck. In her present mood, she had an instinctive longing to revisit the shabby little restaurant where she and Arthur had spent so many happy hours. She knew it would give her pain; but she felt that pain was what she needed—sharp, clean, insistent pain to ease the oppression and disgust of what she had been through. Remorse, she felt, is surgical in action: it cuts away foul tissues of the mind. She could not, without preparatory discipline, face her mother\u0027s outcry at hearing she had given up her job. V In the crisp blue evening air the bright front of Piazza\u0027s café shone with a warm and generous lustre. From sheer force of habit, her heart lightened a little as she climbed the stairs and entered the familiar place, where festoons of red and green paper decoration criss-crossed above the warm, soup-flavoured, tobacco-fogged room. There was a clatter of thick dishes and a clamour of talk. “One?” said the head waiter, his wiry black hair standing erect as though in surprise. She nodded, and followed him down the narrow aisle. There was the little table, in the corner under the stair, where they had always sat. A man was there, reading a newspaper.... Her heart felt very strange, as though it had dropped a long way below its usual place. It was Arthur, and he was smiling at her as though nothing had happened. He was getting up. . . he was shaking hands with her. . . how natural it all seemed! Like all really great crises, it was over in a flash. She found herself sitting at the little table, taking off her gloves in the most casual fashion. Arthur was whispering outrageous things. How fine it is that everybody talks so loud in Italian table d\u0027h?tes, and the waiters crash the dishes round so recklessly! Arthur\u0027s talk seemed to be in two different keys, partly for the benefit of old Tonio, the waiter, and partly for her alone. “Well, here you are! I wondered how soon you\u0027d get here.... Have you forgiven me, dearest?. . . Do you want some minestrone?. . . Why didn\u0027t you answer my letters, brownest eyes? . . . Yes, and some of the near-beer.. . . Darling, it was all my fault. I wrote to tell you so. Didn\u0027t you get my letter?” After all, at such times there isn\u0027t much explaining done, A happy reconciliation is the magic of a moment, and no explanations are necessary. The trouble just drops away, and life begins again from the last kind thing that was said. All Ann could do was whisper: “No, Arthur—it was I who was wrong. I—I\u0027ve given up the Lovelorn.” And then, after a sudden moisture of eye on both sides, the steaming minestrone came on in its battered leaden tureen from which the silver plating disappeared long ago, and under pretense of serving her soup Arthur stretched out his hand. She put out hers to meet it, and found the ring slipped deftly back on her finger. “But, Arthur,” she said, presently, “I thought you were out of town.” “I was,” he said. “I\u0027ve got a new job, with King and Company in Boston. A good job, too, we can be married right away, and you don\u0027t need to worry.” “Well, how did you happen to come here tonight? You didn\u0027t know I was going to be here. I didn\u0027t know it myself until an hour or so ago.” “Perhaps I willed you to come, who knows?” he said, gaily. “Have you been advising lovers all this while, and didn\u0027t know that they always haunt the scenes of former felicity? I\u0027ve been in town several days, and came here every night.” He produced a copy of the Evening Planet which he had been reading when she came in. “I had a special reason for thinking you might come here to-night,” he said. “This afternoon I read your column, and I saw Jessie\u0027s letter and your answer. What you said made me think that perhaps you might be willing to forgive me.” Ann, once more safely enthroned on the shining glory of her happiness, felt that she could afford to tease him just a little. “Ah,” she said, “so you admit that some of those letters people write me are genuine, and that the answers do some good?” He smiled at her and laid his hand over the ring, which outglittered even the most newly nickeled of Piazza\u0027s cutlery. “Yes, honey,” he said. “I admit it. And I knew that Jessie\u0027s letter was genuine, because I wrote it myself.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3206/87623.html","bookId":757,"book":{"id":757,"title":"Tales From a Rolltop Desk","description":"简介： LESTER VALIANT came back from Oxford with the degree of B.
