{"id":17149,"no":3,"title":"The State of the Empire","content":"4Before I commence my task, it seems best to go back and consider the state of affairs in the city, the temper of the armies, the condition of the provinces, and to determine the elements of strength and weakness in the different quarters of the Roman world. By this means we may see not only the actual course of events, which is largely governed by chance, but also why and how they occurred. The death of Nero, after the first outburst of joy with which it was greeted, soon aroused conflicting feelings not only among the senators, the people, and the soldiers in the city, but also among the generals and their troops abroad. It had divulged a secret of state: an emperor could be made elsewhere than at Rome. Still the senate was satisfied. They had immediately taken advantage of their liberty and were naturally emboldened against a prince who was new to the throne and, moreover, absent. The highest class of the knights9 seconded the senate\u0027s satisfaction. Respectable citizens, who were attached as clients or freedmen to the great families, and had seen their 21patrons condemned or exiled, now revived their hopes. The lowest classes, who had grown familiar with the pleasures of the theatre and the circus, the most degraded of the slaves, and Nero\u0027s favourites who had squandered their property and lived on his discreditable bounty, all showed signs of depression and an eager greed for news. 5The troops in the city10 had long been inured to the allegiance of the Caesars, and it was more by the pressure of intrigue than of their own inclination that they came to desert Nero. They soon realized that the donation promised in Galba\u0027s name was not to be paid to them, and that peace would not, like war, offer opportunity for great services and rich rewards. Since they also saw that the new emperor\u0027s favour had been forestalled by the army which proclaimed him, they were ripe for revolution and were further instigated by their rascally Praefect Nymphidius Sabinus, who was plotting to be emperor himself. His design was as a matter of fact detected and quashed, but, though the ringleader was removed, many of the troops still felt conscious of their treason and could be heard commenting on Galba\u0027s senility and avarice. His austerity—a quality once admired and set high in soldiers\u0027 estimation—only annoyed troops whose contempt for the old methods of discipline had been fostered by fourteen years of service 22under Nero. They had come to love the emperors\u0027 vices as much as they once reverenced their virtues in older days. Moreover Galba had let fall a remark, which augured well for Rome, though it spelt danger to himself. \u0027I do not buy my soldiers,\u0027 he said, \u0027I select them.\u0027 And indeed, as things then stood, his words sounded incongruous. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3268/89414.html","bookId":517,"book":{"id":517,"title":"Tacitus: The Histories","description":"简介： Tacitus held the consulship under Nerva in the year 97.
