[bbe] Give these orders to the children of Israel: When anyone of you makes an offering to the Lord, you are to take it from the cattle, from the herd or from the flock. 1:3 [hgb] 他 的 供 物 若 以 牛 为 燔 祭 ， 就 要 在 会 幕 门 口 献 一 只 没 有 残 疾 的 公 牛 ， 可 以 在 耶 和 华 面 前 蒙 悦 纳 。 [kjv] If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. [bbe] If the offering is a burned offering of the herd, let him give a male without a mark: he is to give it at the door of the Tent of meeting so that he may be pleasing to the Lord. 1:4 [hgb] 他 要 按 手 在 燔 祭 牲 的 头 上 ， 燔 祭 便 蒙 悦 纳 ， 为 他 赎 罪 。 [kjv] And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. [bbe] And he is to put his hand on the head of the burned offering and it will be taken for him, to take away his sin. 1:5 [hgb] 他 要 在 耶 和 华 面 前 宰 公 牛 ， 亚 伦 子 孙 作 祭 司 的 ， 要 奉 上 血 ， 把 血 洒 在 会 幕 门 口 ， 坛 的 周 围 。 [kjv] And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron\u0027s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. [bbe] And the ox is to be put to death before the Lord: then Aaron\u0027s sons, the priests, are to take the blood and put some of it on and round the altar which is at the door of the Tent of meeting. 1:6 [hgb] 那 人 要 剥 去 燔 祭 牲 的 皮 ， 把 燔 祭 牲 切 成 块 子 。 [kjv] And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. [bbe] And the burned offering is to be skinned and cut up into its parts. 1:7 [hgb] 祭 司 亚 伦 的 子 孙 要 把 火 放 在 坛 上 ， 把 柴 摆 在 火 上 。 [kjv] And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire: [bbe] And Aaron\u0027s sons, the priests, are to put fire on the altar and put the wood in order on the fire: 1:8 [hgb] 亚 伦 子 孙 作 祭 司 的 ， 要 把 肉 块 和 头 并 脂 油 摆 在 坛 上 火 的 柴 上 。 [kjv] And the priests, Aaron\u0027s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: [bbe] And Aaron\u0027s sons, the priests, are to put the parts, the head and the fat, in order on the wood which is on the fire on the altar: 1:9 [hgb] 但 燔 祭 的 脏 腑 与 腿 要 用 水 洗 。 祭 司 就 要 把 一 切 全 烧 在 坛 上 ， 当 作 燔 祭 ， 献 与 耶 和 华 为 馨 香 的 火 祭 。 [kjv] But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. [bbe] But its inside parts and its legs are to be washed with water, and it will all be burned on the altar by the priest for a burned offering, an offering made by fire, for a sweet smell to the Lord. 1:10 [hgb] 人 的 供 物 若 以 绵 羊 或 山 羊 为 燔 祭 ， 就 要 献 上 没 有 残 疾 的 公 羊 。 [kjv] And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. [bbe] And if his offering is of the flock, a burned offering of sheep or goats, let him give a male without a mark. 1:11 [hgb] 要 把 羊 宰 于 坛 的 北 边 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 亚 伦 子 孙 作 祭 司 的 ， 要 把 羊 血 洒 在 坛 的 周 围 。 [kjv] And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron\u0027s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar. [bbe] And he is to put it to death on the north side of the altar before the Lord: and Aaron\u0027s sons, the priests, are to put some of the blood on and round the altar. 1:12 [hgb] 要 把 燔 祭 牲 切 成 块 子 ， 连 头 和 脂 油 ， 祭 司 就 要 摆 在 坛 上 火 的 柴 上 。 [kjv] And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: [bbe] And the offering is to be cut into its parts, with its head and its fat; and the priest is to put them in order on the wood which is on the fire on the altar: 1:13 [hgb] 但 脏 腑 与 腿 要 用 水 洗 ， 祭 司 就 要 全 然 奉 献 ， 烧 在 坛 上 。 这 是 燔 祭 ， 是 献 与 耶 和 华 为 馨 香 的 火 祭 。 [kjv] But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. [bbe] But the inside parts and the legs are to be washed with water; and the priest will make an offering of all of it, burning it on the altar: it is a burned offering, an offering made by fire, for a sweet smell to the Lord. 1:14 [hgb] 人 奉 给 耶 和 华 的 供 物 ， 若 以 鸟 为 燔 祭 ， 就 要 献 斑 鸠 或 是 雏 鸽 为 供 物 。 [kjv] And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. [bbe] And if his offering to the Lord is a burned offering of birds, then he is to make his offering of doves or of young pigeons. 1:15 [hgb] 祭 司 要 把 鸟 拿 到 坛 前 ， 揪 下 头 来 ， 把 鸟 烧 在 坛 上 ， 鸟 的 血 要 流 在 坛 的 旁 边 。 [kjv] And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar: [bbe] And the priest is to take it to the altar, and after its head has been twisted off, it is to be burned on the altar, and its blood drained out on the side of the altar: 1:16 [hgb] 又 要 把 鸟 的 嗉 子 和 脏 物 除 掉 （ 脏 物 或 作 翎 毛 ） ， 丢 在 坛 的 东 边 倒 灰 的 地 方 。 [kjv] And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: [bbe] And he is to take away its stomach, with its feathers, and put it down by the east side of the altar, where the burned waste is put: 1:17 [hgb] 要 拿 着 鸟 的 两 个 翅 膀 ， 把 鸟 撕 开 ， 只 是 不 可 撕 断 ， 祭 司 要 在 坛 上 ， 在 火 的 柴 上 焚 烧 。 这 是 燔 祭 ， 是 献 与 耶 和 华 为 馨 香 的 火 祭 。 [kjv] And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. [bbe] And let it be broken open at the wings, but not cut in two; and let it be burned on the altar by the priest on the wood which is on the fire; it is a burned offering; an offering made by fire for a sweet smell to the Lord.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19/331.html","bookId":241,"book":{"id":241,"title":"Leviticus利未记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shal...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
