This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female. \n [bbe] And the priest is to make an offering of it before the Lord and take away her sin, and she will be made clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for a woman who gives birth to a male or a female. \n 12:8 [hgb] 她 的 力 量 若 不 够 献 一 只 羊 羔 ， 她 就 要 取 两 只 斑 鸠 或 是 两 只 雏 鸽 ， 一 只 为 燔 祭 ， 一 只 为 赎 罪 祭 。 祭 司 要 为 她 赎 罪 ， 她 就 洁 净 了 。 \n [kjv] And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean. \n [bbe] And if she has not money enough for a lamb, then let her take two doves or two young pigeons, one for a burned offering and the other for a sin-offering, and the priest will take away her sin and she will be clean, \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19/442.html","bookId":241,"book":{"id":241,"title":"Leviticus利未记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shal...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
