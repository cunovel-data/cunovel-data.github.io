for I am the Lord your God. \n 26:2 [hgb] 你 们 要 守 我 的 安 息 日 ， 敬 我 的 圣 所 。 我 是 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. \n [bbe] Keep my Sabbaths and give honour to my holy place: I am the Lord. \n 26:3 [hgb] 你 们 若 遵 行 我 的 律 例 ， 谨 守 我 的 诫 命 ， \n [kjv] If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; \n [bbe] If you are guided by my rules, and keep my laws and do them, \n 26:4 [hgb] 我 就 给 你 们 降 下 时 雨 ， 叫 地 生 出 土 产 ， 田 野 的 树 木 结 果 子 。 \n [kjv] Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. \n [bbe] Then I will give you rain at the right time, and the land will give her increase and the trees of the field will give their fruit; \n 26:5 [hgb] 你 们 打 粮 食 要 打 到 摘 葡 萄 的 时 候 ， 摘 葡 萄 要 摘 到 撒 种 的 时 候 ， 并 且 要 吃 得 饱 足 ， 在 你 们 的 地 上 安 然 居 住 。 \n [kjv] And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. \n [bbe] And the crushing of the grain will overtake the cutting of the grapes, and the cutting of the grapes will overtake the planting of the seed, and there will be bread in full measure, and you will be living in your land safely. \n 26:6 [hgb] 我 要 赐 平 安 在 你 们 的 地 上 ， 你 们 躺 卧 ， 无 人 惊 吓 。 我 要 叫 恶 兽 从 你 们 的 地 上 息 灭 ， 刀 剑 也 必 不 经 过 你 们 的 地 。 \n [kjv] And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. \n [bbe] And I will give you peace in the land, and you will take your rest and no one will give you cause for fear; and I will put an end to all evil beasts in the land, and no sword of war will go through your land. \n 26:7 [hgb] 你 们 要 追 赶 仇 敌 ， 他 们 必 倒 在 你 们 刀 下 。 \n [kjv] And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. \n [bbe] And you will put to flight those who are against you, and they will be put to death by your swords. \n 26:8 [hgb] 你 们 五 个 人 要 追 赶 一 百 人 ， 一 百 人 要 追 赶 一 万 人 ， 仇 敌 必 倒 在 你 们 刀 下 。 \n [kjv] And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. \n [bbe] Then five of you will put to flight a hundred, and a hundred of you will put to flight ten thousand, and all who are against you will be put to death by your swords. \n 26:9 [hgb] 我 要 眷 顾 你 们 ， 使 你 们 生 养 众 多 ， 也 要 与 你 们 坚 定 所 立 的 约 。 \n [kjv] For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. \n [bbe] And I will have pleasure in you and make you fertile and greater in number; and I will keep my agreement with you. \n 26:10 [hgb] 你 们 要 吃 陈 粮 ， 又 因 新 粮 挪 开 陈 粮 。 \n [kjv] And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new. \n [bbe] And old stores long kept will be your food, and you will take out the old because of the new; \n 26:11 [hgb] 我 要 在 你 们 中 间 立 我 的 帐 幕 ， 我 的 心 也 不 厌 恶 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. \n [bbe] And I will put my holy House among you, and my soul will not be turned away from you in disgust. \n 26:12 [hgb] 我 要 在 你 们 中 间 行 走 ， 我 要 作 你 们 的 神 ， 你 们 要 作 我 的 子 民 。 \n [kjv] And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. \n [bbe] And I will be present among you and will be your God and you will be my people. \n 26:13 [hgb] 我 是 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 曾 将 你 们 从 埃 及 地 领 出 来 ， 使 你 们 不 作 埃 及 人 的 奴 仆 ， 我 也 折 断 你 们 所 负 的 轭 ， 叫 你 们 挺 身 而 走 。 \n [kjv] I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright. \n [bbe] I am the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt so that you might not be servants to them; by me the cords of your yoke were broken and I made you go upright. \n 26:14 [hgb] 你 们 若 不 听 从 我 ， 不 遵 行 我 的 诫 命 ， \n [kjv] But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; \n [bbe] But if you do not give ear to me, and do not keep all these my laws; \n 26:15 [hgb] 厌 弃 我 的 律 例 ， 厌 恶 我 的 典 章 ， 不 遵 行 我 一 切 的 诫 命 ， 背 弃 我 的 约 ， \n [kjv] And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant: \n [bbe] And if you go against my rules and if you have hate in your souls for my decisions and you do not do all my orders, but go against my agreement; \n 26:16 [hgb] 我 待 你 们 就 要 这 样 ， 我 必 命 定 惊 惶 ， 叫 眼 目 干 瘪 ， 精 神 消 耗 的 痨 病 热 病 辖 制 你 们 。 你 们 也 要 白 白 地 撒 种 ， 因 为 仇 敌 要 吃 你 们 所 种 的 。 \n [kjv] I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. \n [bbe] This will I do to you: I will put fear in your hearts, even wasting disease and burning pain, drying up the eyes and making the soul feeble, and you will get no profit from your seed, for your haters will take it for food. \n 26:17 [hgb] 我 要 向 你 们 变 脸 ， 你 们 就 要 败 在 仇 敌 面 前 。 恨 恶 你 们 的 ， 必 辖 管 你 们 ， 无 人 追 赶 ， 你 们 却 要 逃 跑 。 \n [kjv] And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. \n [bbe] And my face will be turned from you, and you will be broken before those who are against you, and your haters will become your rulers, and you will go in flight when no man comes after you. \n 26:18 [hgb] 你 们 因 这 些 事 若 还 不 听 从 我 ， 我 就 要 为 你 们 的 罪 加 七 倍 惩 罚 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. \n [bbe] And if, even after these things, you will not give ear to me, then I will send you punishment seven times more for your sins. \n 26:19 [hgb] 我 必 断 绝 你 们 因 势 力 而 有 的 骄 傲 ， 又 要 使 覆 你 们 的 天 如 铁 ， 载 你 们 的 地 如 铜 。 \n [kjv] And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: \n [bbe] And the pride of your strength will be broken, and I will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass; \n 26:20 [hgb] 你 们 要 白 白 地 劳 力 ， 因 为 你 们 的 地 不 出 土 产 ， 其 上 的 树 木 也 不 结 果 子 。 \n [kjv] And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. \n [bbe] And your strength will be used up without profit; for your land will not give her increase and the trees of the field will not give their fruit. \n 26:21 [hgb] 你 们 行 事 若 与 我 反 对 ， 不 肯 听 从 我 ， 我 就 要 按 你 们 的 罪 加 七 倍 降 灾 与 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. \n [bbe] And if you still go against me and will not give ear to me, I will put seven times more punishments on you because of your sins. \n 26:22 [hgb] 我 也 要 打 发 野 地 的 走 兽 到 你 们 中 间 ， 抢 吃 你 们 的 儿 女 ， 吞 灭 你 们 的 牲 畜 ， 使 你 们 的 人 数 减 少 ， 道 路 荒 凉 。 \n [kjv] I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate. \n [bbe] I will let loose the beasts of the field among you, and they will take away your children and send destruction on your cattle, so that your numbers will become small and your roads become waste. \n 26:23 [hgb] 你 们 因 这 些 事 若 仍 不 改 正 归 我 ， 行 事 与 我 反 对 ， \n [kjv] And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; \n [bbe] And if by these things you will not be turned to me, but still go against me; \n 26:24 [hgb] 我 就 要 行 事 与 你 们 反 对 ， 因 你 们 的 罪 击 打 你 们 七 次 。 \n [kjv] Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. \n [bbe] Then I will go against you, and I will give you punishment, I myself, seven times for all your sins. \n 26:25 [hgb] 我 又 要 使 刀 剑 临 到 你 们 ， 报 复 你 们 背 约 的 仇 ， 聚 集 你 们 在 各 城 内 ， 降 瘟 疫 在 你 们 中 间 ， 也 必 将 你 们 交 在 仇 敌 的 手 中 。 \n [kjv] And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. \n [bbe] And I will send a sword on you to give effect to the punishment of my agreement; and when you come together into your towns I will send disease among you and you will be given up into the hands of your haters. \n 26:26 [hgb] 我 要 折 断 你 们 的 杖 ， 就 是 断 绝 你 们 的 粮 。 那 时 ， 必 有 十 个 女 人 在 一 个 炉 子 给 你 们 烤 饼 ， 按 分 量 秤 给 你 们 ， 你 们 要 吃 ， 也 吃 不 饱 。 \n [kjv] And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. \n [bbe] When I take away your bread of life, ten women will be cooking bread in one oven, and your bread will be measured out by weight; you will have food but never enough. \n 26:27 [hgb] 你 们 因 这 一 切 的 事 若 不 听 从 我 ， 却 行 事 与 我 反 对 ， \n [kjv] And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; \n [bbe] And if, after all this, you do not give ear to me, but go against me still, \n 26:28 [hgb] 我 就 要 发 烈 怒 ， 行 事 与 你 们 反 对 ， 又 因 你 们 的 罪 惩 罚 你 们 七 次 。 \n [kjv] Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. \n [bbe] Then my wrath will be burning against you, and I will give you punishment, I myself, seven times for your sins. \n 26:29 [hgb] 并 且 你 们 要 吃 儿 子 的 肉 ， 也 要 吃 女 儿 的 肉 。 \n [kjv] And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. \n [bbe] Then you will take the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters for food; \n 26:30 [hgb] 我 又 要 毁 坏 你 们 的 丘 坛 ， 砍 下 你 们 的 日 像 ， 把 你 们 的 尸 首 扔 在 你 们 偶 像 的 身 上 ， 我 的 心 也 必 厌 恶 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. \n [bbe] And I will send destruction on your high places, overturning your perfume altars, and will put your dead bodies on your broken images, and my soul will be turned from you in disgust. \n 26:31 [hgb] 我 要 使 你 们 的 城 邑 变 为 荒 凉 ， 使 你 们 的 众 圣 所 成 为 荒 场 ， 我 也 不 闻 你 们 馨 香 的 香 气 。 \n [kjv] And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. \n [bbe] And I will make your towns waste and send destruction on your holy places; I will take no pleasure in the smell of your sweet perfumes; \n 26:32 [hgb] 我 要 使 地 成 为 荒 场 ， 住 在 其 上 的 仇 敌 就 因 此 诧 异 。 \n [kjv] And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. \n [bbe] And I will make your land a waste, a wonder to your haters living in it. \n 26:33 [hgb] 我 要 把 你 们 散 在 列 邦 中 ， 我 也 要 拔 刀 追 赶 你 们 。 你 们 的 地 要 成 为 荒 场 ， 你 们 的 城 邑 要 变 为 荒 凉 。 \n [kjv] And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. \n [bbe] And I will send you out in all directions among the nations, and my sword will be uncovered against you, and your land will be without any living thing, and your towns will be made waste. \n 26:34 [hgb] 你 们 在 仇 敌 之 地 居 住 的 时 候 ， 你 们 的 地 荒 凉 要 享 受 众 安 息 ， 正 在 那 时 候 ， 地 要 歇 息 ， 享 受 安 息 。 \n [kjv] Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies\u0027 land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. \n [bbe] Then will the land take pleasure in its Sabbaths while it is waste and you are living in the land of your haters; then will the land have rest. \n 26:35 [hgb] 地 多 时 为 荒 场 ， 就 要 多 时 歇 息 ， 地 这 样 歇 息 ， 是 你 们 住 在 其 上 的 安 息 年 所 不 能 得 的 。 \n [kjv] As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. \n [bbe] All the days while it is waste will the land have rest, such rest as it never had in your Sabbaths, when you were living in it. \n 26:36 [hgb] 至 于 你 们 剩 下 的 人 ， 我 要 使 他 们 在 仇 敌 之 地 心 惊 胆 怯 。 叶 子 被 风 吹 的 响 声 ， 要 追 赶 他 们 ， 他 们 要 逃 避 ， 像 人 逃 避 刀 剑 ， 无 人 追 赶 ， 却 要 跌 倒 。 \n [kjv] And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. \n [bbe] And as for the rest of you, I will make their hearts feeble in the land of their haters, and the sound of a leaf moved by the wind will send them in flight, and they will go in flight as from the sword, falling down when no one comes after them; \n 26:37 [hgb] 无 人 追 赶 ， 他 们 要 彼 此 撞 跌 ， 像 在 刀 剑 之 前 。 你 们 在 仇 敌 面 前 也 必 站 立 不 住 。 \n [kjv] And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. \n [bbe] Falling on one another, as before the sword, when no one comes after them; you will give way before your haters. \n 26:38 [hgb] 你 们 要 在 列 邦 中 灭 亡 ， 仇 敌 之 地 要 吞 吃 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. \n [bbe] And death will overtake you among strange nations, and the land of your haters will be your destruction. \n 26:39 [hgb] 你 们 剩 下 的 人 必 因 自 己 的 罪 孽 和 祖 宗 的 罪 孽 在 仇 敌 之 地 消 灭 。 \n [kjv] And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies\u0027 lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. \n [bbe] And those of you who are still living will be wasting away in their sins in the land of your haters; in the sins of their fathers they will be wasting away. \n 26:40 [hgb] 他 们 要 承 认 自 己 的 罪 和 他 们 祖 宗 的 罪 ， 就 是 干 犯 我 的 那 罪 ， 并 且 承 认 自 己 行 事 与 我 反 对 ， \n [kjv] If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; \n [bbe] And they will have grief for their sins and for the sins of their fathers, when their hearts were untrue to me, and they went against me; \n 26:41 [hgb] 我 所 以 行 事 与 他 们 反 对 ， 把 他 们 带 到 仇 敌 之 地 。 那 时 ， 他 们 未 受 割 礼 的 心 若 谦 卑 了 ， 他 们 也 服 了 罪 孽 的 刑 罚 ， \n [kjv] And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: \n [bbe] So that I went against them and sent them away into the land of their haters: if then the pride of their hearts is broken and they take the punishment of their sins, \n 26:42 [hgb] 我 就 要 记 念 我 与 雅 各 所 立 的 约 ， 与 以 撒 所 立 的 约 ， 与 亚 伯 拉 罕 所 立 的 约 ， 并 要 记 念 这 地 。 \n [kjv] Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. \n [bbe] Then I will keep in mind the agreement which I made with Jacob and with Isaac and with Abraham, and I will keep in mind the land. \n 26:43 [hgb] 他 们 离 开 这 地 ， 地 在 荒 废 无 人 的 时 候 就 要 享 受 安 息 。 并 且 他 们 要 服 罪 孽 的 刑 罚 ， 因 为 他 们 厌 弃 了 我 的 典 章 ， 心 中 厌 恶 了 我 的 律 例 。 \n [kjv] The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. \n [bbe] And the land, while she is without them, will keep her Sabbaths; and they will undergo the punishment of their sins, because they were turned away from my decisions and in their souls was hate for my laws. \n 26:44 [hgb] 虽 是 这 样 ， 他 们 在 仇 敌 之 地 ， 我 却 不 厌 弃 他 们 ， 也 不 厌 恶 他 们 ， 将 他 们 尽 行 灭 绝 ， 也 不 背 弃 我 与 他 们 所 立 的 约 ， 因 为 我 是 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 。 \n [kjv] And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God. \n [bbe] But for all that, when they are in the land of their haters I will not let them go, or be turned away from them, or give them up completely; my agreement with them will not be broken, for I am the Lord their God. \n 26:45 [hgb] 我 却 要 为 他 们 的 缘 故 记 念 我 与 他 们 先 祖 所 立 的 约 。 他 们 的 先 祖 是 我 在 列 邦 人 眼 前 ， 从 埃 及 地 领 出 来 的 ， 为 要 作 他 们 的 神 。 我 是 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD. \n [bbe] And because of them I will keep in mind the agreement which I made with their fathers, whom I took out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, to be their God: I am the Lord. \n 26:46 [hgb] 这 些 律 例 ， 典 章 ， 和 法 度 是 耶 和 华 与 以 色 列 人 在 西 乃 山 借 着 摩 西 立 的 。 \n [kjv] These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses. \n [bbe] These are the rules, decisions, and laws, which the Lord made between himself and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19/456.html","bookId":241,"book":{"id":241,"title":"Leviticus利未记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shal...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
