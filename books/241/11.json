[bbe] Say to the children of Israel: These are the living things which you may have for food among all the beasts on the earth. 11:3 [hgb] 凡 蹄 分 两 瓣 ， 倒 嚼 的 走 兽 ， 你 们 都 可 以 吃 。 [kjv] Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. [bbe] You may have as food any beast which has a division in the horn of its foot, and whose food comes back into its mouth to be crushed again. 11:4 [hgb] 但 那 倒 嚼 或 分 蹄 之 中 不 可 吃 的 乃 是 骆 驼 ， 因 为 倒 嚼 不 分 蹄 ， 就 与 你 们 不 洁 净 。 [kjv] Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. [bbe] But, at the same time, of those beasts, you may not take for food the camel, because its food comes back but the horn of its foot is not parted in two; it is unclean to you. 11:5 [hgb] 沙 番 因 为 倒 嚼 不 分 蹄 ， 就 与 你 们 不 洁 净 。 [kjv] And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

[bbe] Their flesh may not be used for food, and their dead bodies may not even be touched; they are unclean to you. 11:9 [hgb] 水 中 可 吃 的 乃 是 这 些 ， 凡 在 水 里 ， 海 里 ， 河 里 ， 有 翅 有 鳞 的 ， 都 可 以 吃 。 [kjv] These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. [bbe] These you may have for food of all things living in the water: anything living in the water, in the seas or rivers, which has special parts for swimming and skin formed of thin plates, may be used for food. 11:10 [hgb] 凡 在 海 里 ， 河 里 ， 并 一 切 水 里 游 动 的 活 物 ， 无 翅 无 鳞 的 ， 你 们 都 当 以 为 可 憎 。 [kjv] And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: [bbe] All other things living and moving in the water, in the sea or in the rivers, are a disgusting thing to you; 11:11 [hgb] 这 些 无 翅 无 鳞 ， 以 为 可 憎 的 ， 你 们 不 可 吃 它 的 肉 ， 死 的 也 当 以 为 可 憎 。 [kjv] They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. [bbe] They may not be used for food, and their dead bodies are disgusting to you. 11:12 [hgb] 凡 水 里 无 翅 无 鳞 的 ， 你 们 都 当 以 为 可 憎 。 [kjv] Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.

[bbe] Every beast, in the horn of whose foot there is not a complete division, and whose food does not come back, is unclean to you: anyone touching one of these will be unclean. 11:27 [hgb] 凡 四 足 的 走 兽 ， 用 掌 行 走 的 ， 是 与 你 们 不 洁 净 ， 摸 其 尸 的 ， 必 不 洁 净 到 晚 上 。 [kjv] And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.

[bbe] Everything which goes flat on its body on the earth is disgusting, and is not to be used for food. 11:42 [hgb] 凡 用 肚 子 行 走 的 和 用 四 足 行 走 的 ， 或 是 有 许 多 足 的 ， 就 是 一 切 爬 在 地 上 的 ， 你 们 都 不 可 吃 ， 因 为 是 可 憎 的 。 [kjv] Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination. [bbe] Whatever goes on its stomach or on four feet or has a great number of feet, even all those going flat on the earth, may not be used for food, for they are disgusting. 11:43 [hgb] 你 们 不 可 因 什 么 爬 物 使 自 己 成 为 可 憎 的 ， 也 不 可 因 这 些 使 自 己 不 洁 净 ， 以 致 染 了 污 秽 。 [kjv] Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. [bbe] You are not to make yourselves disgusting with anything which goes about flat on the earth; you may not make yourselves unclean with them, in such a way that you are not holy to me. 11:44 [hgb] 我 是 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 所 以 你 们 要 成 为 圣 洁 ， 因 为 我 是 圣 洁 的 。 你 们 也 不 可 在 地 上 的 爬 物 污 秽 自 己 。 [kjv] For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. [bbe] For I am the Lord your God: for this reason, make and keep yourselves holy, for I am holy; you are not to make yourselves unclean with any sort of thing which goes about flat on the earth. 11:45 [hgb] 我 是 把 你 们 从 埃 及 地 领 出 来 的 耶 和 华 ， 要 作 你 们 的 神 ， 所 以 你 们 要 圣 洁 ， 因 为 我 是 圣 洁 的 。 [kjv] For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy. [bbe] For I am the Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God; so be you holy, for I am holy. 11:46 [hgb] 这 是 走 兽 ， 飞 鸟 ， 和 水 中 游 动 的 活 物 ， 并 地 上 爬 物 的 条 例 。 [kjv] This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth: [bbe] This is the law about beasts and birds and every living thing moving in the waters, and every living thing which goes flat on the earth: 11:47 [hgb] 要 把 洁 净 的 和 不 洁 净 的 ， 可 吃 的 与 不 可 吃 的 活 物 ， 都 分 别 出 来 。 [kjv] To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten. [bbe] Marking out the unclean from the clean, and the living thing which may be used for food from that which may not.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19/441.html","bookId":241,"book":{"id":241,"title":"Leviticus利未记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shal...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
