{"id":7365,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"13:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 说 ， [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, 13:2 [hgb] 人 的 肉 皮 上 若 长 了 疖 子 ， 或 长 了 癣 ， 或 长 了 火 斑 ， 在 他 肉 皮 上 成 了 大 麻 疯 的 灾 病 ， 就 要 将 他 带 到 祭 司 亚 伦 或 亚 伦 作 祭 司 的 一 个 子 孙 面 前 。 [kjv] When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests: [bbe] If a man has on his skin a growth or a mark or a white place, and it becomes the disease of a leper, let him be taken to Aaron the priest, or to one of the priests, his sons; 13:3 [hgb] 祭 司 要 察 看 肉 皮 上 的 灾 病 ， 若 灾 病 处 的 毛 已 经 变 白 ， 灾 病 的 现 象 深 于 肉 上 的 皮 ， 这 便 是 大 麻 疯 的 灾 病 。 祭 司 要 察 看 他 ， 定 他 为 不 洁 净 。 [kjv] And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. [bbe] And if, when the priest sees the mark on his skin, the hair on the place is turned white and the mark seems to go deeper than the skin, it is the mark of a leper: and the priest, after looking at him, will say that he is unclean. 13:4 [hgb] 若 火 斑 在 他 肉 皮 上 是 白 的 ， 现 象 不 深 于 皮 ， 其 上 的 毛 也 没 有 变 白 ， 祭 司 就 要 将 有 灾 病 的 人 关 锁 七 天 。 [kjv] If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days: [bbe] But if the mark on his skin is white, and does not seem to go deeper than the skin, and the hair on it is not turned white, then the priest will keep him shut up for seven days; 13:5 [hgb] 第 七 天 ， 祭 司 要 察 看 他 ， 若 看 灾 病 止 住 了 ， 没 有 在 皮 上 发 散 ， 祭 司 还 要 将 他 关 锁 七 天 。 [kjv] And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more: [bbe] And the priest is to see him on the seventh day; and if, in his opinion, the place on his skin has not become worse and is not increased in size, then the priest will keep him shut up for seven days more: 13:6 [hgb] 第 七 天 ， 祭 司 要 再 察 看 他 ， 若 灾 病 发 暗 ， 而 且 没 有 在 皮 上 发 散 ， 祭 司 要 定 他 为 洁 净 ， 原 来 是 癣 ， 那 人 就 要 洗 衣 服 ， 得 为 洁 净 。 [kjv] And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. [bbe] And the priest is to see him again on the seventh day; and if the mark is less bright and is not increased on his skin, then let the priest say that he is clean: it is only a skin-mark, and after his clothing has been washed he will be clean. 13:7 [hgb] 但 他 为 得 洁 净 ， 将 身 体 给 祭 司 察 看 以 后 ， 癣 若 在 皮 上 发 散 开 了 ， 他 要 再 将 身 体 给 祭 司 察 看 。 [kjv] But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again: [bbe] But if the size of the mark on his skin is increased after he has been seen by the priest, let him go to the priest again: 13:8 [hgb] 祭 司 要 察 看 ， 癣 若 在 皮 上 发 散 ， 就 要 定 他 为 不 洁 净 ， 是 大 麻 疯 。 [kjv] And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy. [bbe] And if, after looking at him, he sees that the mark is increased in his skin, let the priest say that he is unclean; he is a leper. 13:9 [hgb] 人 有 了 大 麻 疯 的 灾 病 ， 就 要 将 他 带 到 祭 司 面 前 。 [kjv] When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest; [bbe] When the disease of a leper is seen on a man, let him be taken to the priest; 13:10 [hgb] 祭 司 要 察 看 ， 皮 上 若 长 了 白 疖 ， 使 毛 变 白 ， 在 长 白 疖 之 处 有 了 红 瘀 肉 ， [kjv] And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising; [bbe] And if the priest sees that there is a white growth on the skin, and the hair is turned white, and there is diseased flesh in the growth, 13:11 [hgb] 这 是 肉 皮 上 的 旧 大 麻 疯 ， 祭 司 要 定 他 为 不 洁 净 ， 不 用 将 他 关 锁 ， 因 为 他 是 不 洁 净 了 。 [kjv] It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean. [bbe] It is an old disease in the skin of his flesh, and the priest will say that he is unclean; he will not have to be shut up, for he is clearly unclean. 13:12 [hgb] 大 麻 疯 若 在 皮 上 四 外 发 散 ， 长 满 了 患 灾 病 人 的 皮 ， 据 祭 司 察 看 ， 从 头 到 脚 无 处 不 有 ， [kjv] And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; [bbe] And if the disease comes out all over his skin, from his head to his feet, as far as the priest is able to see, 13:13 [hgb] 祭 司 就 要 察 看 ， 全 身 的 肉 若 长 满 了 大 麻 疯 ， 就 要 定 那 患 灾 病 的 为 洁 净 ， 全 身 都 变 为 白 ， 他 乃 洁 净 了 。 [kjv] Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean. [bbe] And if the priest sees that all his flesh is covered with the leper\u0027s disease, the priest will say that he is clean: it is all turned white, he is clean. 13:14 [hgb] 但 红 肉 几 时 显 在 他 的 身 上 就 几 时 不 洁 净 。 [kjv] But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. [bbe] But whenever diseased flesh is seen on him, he will be unclean. 13:15 [hgb] 祭 司 一 看 那 红 肉 就 定 他 为 不 洁 净 。 红 肉 本 是 不 洁 净 ， 是 大 麻 疯 。 [kjv] And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy. [bbe] And when the priest sees the diseased flesh he will say that he is unclean; the diseased flesh is unclean, he is a leper. 13:16 [hgb] 红 肉 若 复 原 ， 又 变 白 了 ， 他 就 要 来 见 祭 司 。 [kjv] Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest; [bbe] Or if the diseased flesh is turned again and changed to white then he is to come to the priest, 13:17 [hgb] 祭 司 要 察 看 ， 灾 病 处 若 变 白 了 ， 祭 司 就 要 定 那 患 灾 病 的 为 洁 净 ， 他 乃 洁 净 了 。 [kjv] And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean. [bbe] And the priest will see him: and if the place is turned white, then the priest will say that he is free from the disease. 13:18 [hgb] 人 若 在 皮 肉 上 长 疮 ， 却 治 好 了 ， [kjv] The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed, [bbe] And if a bad place has come out on the skin and is well again, 13:19 [hgb] 在 长 疮 之 处 又 起 了 白 疖 ， 或 是 白 中 带 红 的 火 斑 ， 就 要 给 祭 司 察 看 。 [kjv] And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest; [bbe] And on the same place there is a white growth of a bright mark, red and white, then let the priest see it; 13:20 [hgb] 祭 司 要 察 看 ， 若 现 象 洼 于 皮 ， 其 上 的 毛 也 变 白 了 ， 就 要 定 他 为 不 洁 净 ， 是 大 麻 疯 的 灾 病 发 在 疮 中 。 [kjv] And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil. [bbe] And after looking at it, if it seems to go deeper than the skin, and the hair on it is turned white, then the priest will say that the man is unclean: it is the leper\u0027s disease, it has come out in the bad place. 13:21 [hgb] 祭 司 若 察 看 ， 其 上 没 有 白 毛 ， 也 没 有 洼 于 皮 ， 乃 是 发 暗 ， 就 要 将 他 关 锁 七 天 。 [kjv] But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: [bbe] But if, after looking at it, he sees that there are no white hairs on it, and it is not deeper than the skin, and it is not very bright, then let the priest keep him shut up for seven days: 13:22 [hgb] 若 在 皮 上 发 散 开 了 ， 祭 司 就 要 定 他 为 不 洁 净 ， 是 灾 病 。 [kjv] And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague. [bbe] And if it is increasing on the skin, the priest will say that he is unclean: it is a disease. 13:23 [hgb] 火 斑 若 在 原 处 止 住 ， 没 有 发 散 ， 便 是 疮 的 痕 迹 ， 祭 司 就 要 定 他 为 洁 净 。 [kjv] But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. [bbe] But if the bright mark keeps in the same place and gets no greater, it is the mark of the old wound, and the priest will say that he is clean. 13:24 [hgb] 人 的 皮 肉 上 若 起 了 火 毒 ， 火 毒 的 瘀 肉 成 了 火 斑 ， 或 是 白 中 带 红 的 ， 或 是 全 白 的 ， [kjv] Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white; [bbe] Or if there is a burn on the skin of the flesh, and if the diseased flesh in the burn becomes a bright place, red and white or white, 13:25 [hgb] 祭 司 就 要 察 看 ， 火 斑 中 的 毛 若 变 白 了 ， 现 象 又 深 于 皮 ， 是 大 麻 疯 在 火 毒 中 发 出 ， 就 要 定 他 为 不 洁 净 ， 是 大 麻 疯 的 灾 病 。 [kjv] Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. [bbe] The priest is to see it: and if the hair on the bright place is turned white and it seems to go deeper than the skin, he is a leper: it has come out in the burn, and the priest will say that he is unclean: it is the leper\u0027s disease. 13:26 [hgb] 但 是 祭 司 察 看 ， 在 火 斑 中 若 没 有 白 毛 ， 也 没 有 洼 于 皮 ， 乃 是 发 暗 ， 就 要 将 他 关 锁 七 天 。 [kjv] But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: [bbe] But if, after looking at it, the priest sees that there is no white hair on the bright place, and it is not deeper than the skin, and is not very bright, then let the priest keep him shut up for seven days: 13:27 [hgb] 到 第 七 天 ， 祭 司 要 察 看 他 ， 火 斑 若 在 皮 上 发 散 开 了 ， 就 要 定 他 为 不 洁 净 ， 是 大 麻 疯 的 灾 病 。 [kjv] And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. [bbe] And the priest is to see him again on the seventh day; if it is increased in the skin, then the priest will say that he is unclean: it is the leper\u0027s disease. 13:28 [hgb] 火 斑 若 在 原 处 止 住 ， 没 有 在 皮 上 发 散 ， 乃 是 发 暗 ， 是 起 的 火 毒 ， 祭 司 要 定 他 为 洁 净 ， 不 过 是 火 毒 的 痕 迹 。 [kjv] And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning. [bbe] And if the bright place keeps the same size and gets no greater on the skin, but is less bright, it is the effect of the burn, and the priest will say that he is clean: it is the mark of the burn. 13:29 [hgb] 无 论 男 女 ， 若 在 头 上 有 灾 病 ， 或 是 男 人 胡 须 上 有 灾 病 ， [kjv] If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard; [bbe] And when a man or a woman has a disease on the head, or in the hair of the chin, 13:30 [hgb] 祭 司 就 要 察 看 ， 这 灾 病 现 象 若 深 于 皮 ， 其 间 有 细 黄 毛 ， 就 要 定 他 为 不 洁 净 ， 这 是 头 疥 ， 是 头 上 或 是 胡 须 上 的 大 麻 疯 。 [kjv] Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard. [bbe] Then the priest is to see the diseased place: and if it seems to go deeper than the skin, and if there is thin yellow hair in it, then the priest will say that he is unclean: he has the mark of the leper\u0027s disease on his head or in the hair of his chin. 13:31 [hgb] 祭 司 若 察 看 头 疥 的 灾 病 ， 现 象 不 深 于 皮 ， 其 间 也 没 有 黑 毛 ， 就 要 将 长 头 疥 灾 病 的 关 锁 七 天 。 [kjv] And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days: [bbe] And after looking at the diseased place, if it does not seem to go deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest will have him shut up for seven days: 13:32 [hgb] 第 七 天 ， 祭 司 要 察 看 灾 病 ， 若 头 疥 没 有 发 散 ， 其 间 也 没 有 黄 毛 ， 头 疥 的 现 象 不 深 于 皮 ， [kjv] And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin; [bbe] And on the seventh day the priest will see the place: and if it is not increased, and there is no yellow hair in it, and it does not seem to go deeper than the skin, 13:33 [hgb] 那 人 就 要 剃 去 须 发 ， 但 他 不 可 剃 头 疥 之 处 。 祭 司 要 将 那 长 头 疥 的 ， 再 关 锁 七 天 。 [kjv] He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more: [bbe] Then his hair is to be cut off, but not on the diseased place, and he is to be shut up for seven days more: 13:34 [hgb] 第 七 天 ， 祭 司 要 察 看 头 疥 ， 头 疥 若 没 有 在 皮 上 发 散 ， 现 象 也 不 深 于 皮 ， 就 要 定 他 为 洁 净 ， 他 要 洗 衣 服 ， 便 成 为 洁 净 。 [kjv] And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. [bbe] And on the seventh day the priest will see the place: and if it is not increased, and does not seem to go deeper than the skin, the priest will say that he is clean: and after his clothing has been washed he will be clean. 13:35 [hgb] 但 他 得 洁 净 以 后 ， 头 疥 若 在 皮 上 发 散 开 了 ， [kjv] But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing; [bbe] But if the disease in his skin becomes worse after he has been made clean, 13:36 [hgb] 祭 司 就 要 察 看 他 。 头 疥 若 在 皮 上 发 散 ， 就 不 必 找 那 黄 毛 ， 他 是 不 洁 净 了 。 [kjv] Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean. [bbe] Then the priest is to see him: and if the mark is increased, the priest, without looking for the yellow hair, will say that he is unclean. 13:37 [hgb] 祭 司 若 看 头 疥 已 经 止 住 ， 其 间 也 长 了 黑 毛 ， 头 疥 已 然 痊 愈 ， 那 人 是 洁 净 了 ， 就 要 定 他 为 洁 净 。 [kjv] But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean. [bbe] But if, in his opinion, the growth is stopped, and black hair has come up on it, the disease has gone; he is clean and the priest will say that he is clean. 13:38 [hgb] 无 论 男 女 ， 皮 肉 上 若 起 了 火 斑 ， 就 是 白 火 斑 ， [kjv] If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots; [bbe] And if a man or a woman has bright marks on the skin of their flesh, that is, bright white marks, 13:39 [hgb] 祭 司 就 要 察 看 ， 他 们 肉 皮 上 的 火 斑 若 白 中 带 黑 ， 这 是 皮 上 发 出 的 白 癣 ， 那 人 是 洁 净 了 。 [kjv] Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean. [bbe] Then the priest is to see them: and if the white marks on their skin are not very bright, it is a skin disease which has come out on the skin; he is clean. 13:40 [hgb] 人 头 上 的 发 若 掉 了 ， 他 不 过 是 头 秃 ， 还 是 洁 净 。 [kjv] And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean. [bbe] And if a man\u0027s hair has come out and he has no hair, still he is clean. 13:41 [hgb] 他 顶 前 若 掉 了 头 发 ， 他 不 过 是 顶 门 秃 ， 还 是 洁 净 。 [kjv] And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean. [bbe] And if the hair has gone from the front part of his head, so that he has no hair there, still he is clean. 13:42 [hgb] 头 秃 处 或 是 顶 门 秃 处 若 有 白 中 带 红 的 灾 病 ， 这 就 是 大 麻 疯 发 在 他 头 秃 处 或 是 顶 门 秃 处 ， [kjv] And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead. [bbe] But if, on his head or on his brow, where he has no hair, there is a red and white place, it is the disease of the leper coming out on his head or on his brow. 13:43 [hgb] 祭 司 就 要 察 看 ， 他 起 的 那 灾 病 若 在 头 秃 处 或 是 顶 门 秃 处 有 白 中 带 红 的 ， 像 肉 皮 上 大 麻 疯 的 现 象 ， [kjv] Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; [bbe] Then if the priest sees that the growth of the disease has become red and white on his head or on his brow where there is no hair, like the mark in the skin of a leper; 13:44 [hgb] 那 人 就 是 长 大 麻 疯 ， 不 洁 净 的 ， 祭 司 总 要 定 他 为 不 洁 净 ， 他 的 灾 病 是 在 头 上 。 [kjv] He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head. [bbe] He is a leper and unclean; the priest is to say that he is most certainly unclean: the disease is in his head. 13:45 [hgb] 身 上 有 长 大 麻 疯 灾 病 的 ， 他 的 衣 服 要 撕 裂 ， 也 要 蓬 头 散 发 ， 蒙 着 上 唇 ， 喊 叫 说 ， 不 洁 净 了 ， 不 洁 净 了 。 [kjv] And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean. [bbe] And the leper who has the disease on him is to go about with signs of grief, with his hair loose and his mouth covered, crying, Unclean, unclean. 13:46 [hgb] 灾 病 在 他 身 上 的 日 子 ， 他 便 是 不 洁 净 ， 他 既 是 不 洁 净 ， 就 要 独 居 营 外 。 [kjv] All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be. [bbe] While the disease is on him, he will be unclean. He is unclean: let him keep by himself, living outside the tent-circle. 13:47 [hgb] 染 了 大 麻 疯 灾 病 的 衣 服 ， 无 论 是 羊 毛 衣 服 ， 是 麻 布 衣 服 ， [kjv] The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment; [bbe] And any clothing of wool or of linen in which is the mark of the disease; 13:48 [hgb] 无 论 是 在 经 上 ， 在 纬 上 ， 是 麻 布 的 ， 是 羊 毛 的 ， 是 在 皮 子 上 ， 或 在 皮 子 作 的 什 么 物 件 上 ， [kjv] Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin; [bbe] If it is in the threads of the linen or of the wool, or in leather, or in anything made of skin; 13:49 [hgb] 或 在 衣 服 上 ， 皮 子 上 ， 经 上 ， 纬 上 ， 或 在 皮 子 作 的 什 么 物 件 上 ， 这 灾 病 若 是 发 绿 ， 或 是 发 红 ， 是 大 麻 疯 的 灾 病 ， 要 给 祭 司 察 看 。 [kjv] And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest: [bbe] If there are red or green marks on the clothing, or on the leather, or in the threads of the cloth, or in anything made of skin, it is the leper\u0027s disease: let the priest see it. 13:50 [hgb] 祭 司 就 要 察 看 那 灾 病 ， 把 染 了 灾 病 的 物 件 关 锁 七 天 。 [kjv] And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days: [bbe] And after it has been seen by the priest, the thing which is so marked is to be shut up for seven days: 13:51 [hgb] 第 七 天 ， 他 要 察 看 那 灾 病 ， 灾 病 或 在 衣 服 上 ， 经 上 ， 纬 上 ， 皮 子 上 ， 若 发 散 ， 这 皮 子 无 论 当 作 何 用 ， 这 灾 病 是 蚕 食 的 大 麻 疯 ， 都 是 不 洁 净 了 。 [kjv] And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean. [bbe] And he is to see the mark on the seventh day; if the mark is increased in the clothing, or in the threads of the material, or in the leather, whatever the leather is used for, it is the disease biting into it: it is unclean. 13:52 [hgb] 那 染 了 灾 病 的 衣 服 ， 或 是 经 上 ， 纬 上 ， 羊 毛 上 ， 麻 衣 上 ， 或 是 皮 子 作 的 什 么 物 件 上 ， 他 都 要 焚 烧 ， 因 为 这 是 蚕 食 的 大 麻 疯 ， 必 在 火 中 焚 烧 。 [kjv] He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. [bbe] And the clothing, or the wool or linen material, or anything of leather in which is the disease, is to be burned: for the disease is biting into it; let it be burned in the fire. 13:53 [hgb] 祭 司 要 察 看 ， 若 灾 病 在 衣 服 上 ， 经 上 ， 纬 上 ， 或 是 皮 子 作 的 什 么 物 件 上 ， 没 有 发 散 ， [kjv] And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; [bbe] And if the priest sees that the mark is not increased in the clothing or in any part of the material or in the leather, 13:54 [hgb] 祭 司 就 要 吩 咐 他 们 ， 把 染 了 灾 病 的 物 件 洗 了 ， 再 关 锁 七 天 。 [kjv] Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more: [bbe] Then the priest will give orders for the thing on which the mark is, to be washed, and to be shut up for seven days more: 13:55 [hgb] 洗 过 以 后 ， 祭 司 要 察 看 ， 那 物 件 若 没 有 变 色 ， 灾 病 也 没 有 消 散 ， 那 物 件 就 不 洁 净 ， 是 透 重 的 灾 病 ， 无 论 正 面 反 面 ， 都 要 在 火 中 焚 烧 。 [kjv] And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without. [bbe] And if, after the mark has been washed, the priest sees that the colour of it is not changed and it is not increased, it is to be burned in the fire: the disease is working in it, though the damage may be inside or outside. 13:56 [hgb] 洗 过 以 后 ， 祭 司 要 察 看 ， 若 见 那 灾 病 发 暗 ， 他 就 要 把 那 灾 病 从 衣 服 上 ， 皮 子 上 ， 经 上 ， 纬 上 ， 都 撕 去 。 [kjv] And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: [bbe] And if the priest sees that the mark is less bright after the washing, then let him have it cut out of the clothing or the leather or from the threads of the material: 13:57 [hgb] 若 仍 现 在 衣 服 上 ， 或 是 经 上 ， 纬 上 ， 皮 子 作 的 什 么 物 件 上 ， 这 就 是 灾 病 又 发 了 ， 必 用 火 焚 烧 那 染 灾 病 的 物 件 。 [kjv] And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire. [bbe] And if the mark is still seen in the clothing or in the threads of the material or in the leather, it is the disease coming out: the thing in which the disease is will have to be burned with fire. 13:58 [hgb] 所 洗 的 衣 服 ， 或 是 经 ， 或 是 纬 ， 或 是 皮 子 作 的 什 么 物 件 ， 若 灾 病 离 开 了 ， 要 再 洗 ， 就 洁 净 了 。 [kjv] And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. [bbe] And the material of the clothing, or anything of skin, which has been washed, if the mark has gone out of it, let it be washed a second time and it will be clean. 13:59 [hgb] 这 就 是 大 麻 疯 灾 病 的 条 例 ， 无 论 是 在 羊 毛 衣 服 上 ， 麻 布 衣 服 上 ， 经 上 ， 纬 上 ， 和 皮 子 作 的 什 么 物 件 上 ， 可 以 定 为 洁 净 或 是 不 洁 净 。 [kjv] This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean. [bbe] This is the law about the leper\u0027s disease in the thread of wool or linen material, in clothing or in anything of skin, saying how it is to be judged clean or unclean.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19/443.html","bookId":241,"book":{"id":241,"title":"Leviticus利未记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shal...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
