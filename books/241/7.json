{"id":7359,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"7:1 [hgb] 赎 愆 祭 的 条 例 乃 是 如 此 ， 这 祭 是 至 圣 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy. \\n\\n [bbe] And this is the law of the offering for wrongdoing: it is most holy. \\n\\n 7:2 [hgb] 人 在 哪 里 宰 燔 祭 牲 ， 也 要 在 哪 里 宰 赎 愆 祭 牲 ， 其 血 ， 祭 司 要 洒 在 坛 的 周 围 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar. \\n\\n [bbe] They are to put to death the offering for wrongdoing in the same place as the burned offering; and the priest is to put the blood on and round the altar. \\n\\n 7:3 [hgb] 又 要 将 肥 尾 巴 和 盖 脏 的 脂 油 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, \\n\\n [bbe] And all the fat of it, the fat tail and the fat covering the inside parts, is to be given as an offering. \\n\\n 7:4 [hgb] 两 个 腰 子 和 腰 子 上 的 脂 油 ， 就 是 靠 腰 两 旁 的 脂 油 ， 并 肝 上 的 网 子 和 腰 子 ， 一 概 取 下 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: \\n\\n [bbe] And the two kidneys, and the fat on them, which is by the top of the legs, and the fat joining the liver and the kidneys, he is to take away: \\n\\n 7:5 [hgb] 祭 司 要 在 坛 上 焚 烧 ， 为 献 给 耶 和 华 的 火 祭 ， 是 赎 愆 祭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering. \\n\\n [bbe] They are to be burned by the priest on the altar for an offering made by fire to the Lord: it is an offering for wrongdoing. \\n\\n 7:6 [hgb] 祭 司 中 的 男 丁 都 可 以 吃 这 祭 物 ， 要 在 圣 处 吃 ， 是 至 圣 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy. \\n\\n [bbe] Every male among the priests may have it as food in a holy place: it is most holy. \\n\\n 7:7 [hgb] 赎 罪 祭 怎 样 ， 赎 愆 祭 也 是 怎 样 ， 两 个 祭 是 一 个 条 例 。 献 赎 愆 祭 赎 罪 的 祭 司 要 得 这 祭 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it. \\n\\n [bbe] As is the sin-offering, so is the offering for wrongdoing; there is one law for them: the priest who makes the offering to take away sin, he is to have it. \\n\\n 7:8 [hgb] 献 燔 祭 的 祭 司 ， 无 论 为 谁 奉 献 ， 要 亲 自 得 他 所 献 那 燔 祭 牲 的 皮 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the priest that offereth any man\u0027s burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered. \\n\\n [bbe] And the priest offering any man\u0027s burned offering for him, may have the skin of the burned offering which is offered by him. \\n\\n 7:9 [hgb] 凡 在 炉 中 烤 的 素 祭 和 煎 盘 中 作 的 ， 并 铁 鏊 上 作 的 ， 都 要 归 那 献 祭 的 祭 司 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest\u0027s that offereth it. \\n\\n [bbe] And every meal offering which is cooked in the oven and everything made in a cooking pot or on a flat plate, is for the priest by whom it is offered. \\n\\n 7:10 [hgb] 凡 素 祭 ， 无 论 是 油 调 和 的 ， 是 干 的 ， 都 要 归 亚 伦 的 子 孙 ， 大 家 均 分 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another. \\n\\n [bbe] And every meal offering, mixed with oil or dry, is for all the sons of Aaron in equal measure. \\n\\n 7:11 [hgb] 人 献 与 耶 和 华 平 安 祭 的 条 例 乃 是 这 样 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] And this is the law for the peace-offerings offered to the Lord. \\n\\n 7:12 [hgb] 他 若 为 感 谢 献 上 ， 就 要 用 调 油 的 无 酵 饼 和 抹 油 的 无 酵 薄 饼 ， 并 用 油 调 匀 细 面 作 的 饼 ， 与 感 谢 祭 一 同 献 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried. \\n\\n [bbe] If any man gives his offering as a praise-offering, then let him give with the offering, unleavened cakes mixed with oil and thin unleavened cakes covered with oil and cakes of the best meal well mixed with oil. \\n\\n 7:13 [hgb] 要 用 有 酵 的 饼 和 为 感 谢 献 的 平 安 祭 ， 与 供 物 一 同 献 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings. \\n\\n [bbe] With his peace-offering let him give cakes of leavened bread, as a praise-offering. \\n\\n 7:14 [hgb] 从 各 样 的 供 物 中 ， 他 要 把 一 个 饼 献 给 耶 和 华 为 举 祭 ， 是 要 归 给 洒 平 安 祭 牲 血 的 祭 司 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest\u0027s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings. \\n\\n [bbe] And let him give one out of every offering to be lifted up before the Lord; that it may be for the priest who puts the blood of the peace-offering on the altar. \\n\\n 7:15 [hgb] 为 感 谢 献 平 安 祭 牲 的 肉 ， 要 在 献 的 日 子 吃 ， 一 点 不 可 留 到 早 晨 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. \\n\\n [bbe] And the flesh of the praise-offering is to be taken as food on the day when it is offered; no part of it may be kept till the morning. \\n\\n 7:16 [hgb] 若 所 献 的 是 为 还 愿 ， 或 是 甘 心 献 的 ， 必 在 献 祭 的 日 子 吃 ， 所 剩 下 的 第 二 天 也 可 以 吃 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten: \\n\\n [bbe] But if his offering is made because of an oath or given freely, it may be taken as food on the day when it is offered; and the rest may be used up on the day after: \\n\\n 7:17 [hgb] 但 所 剩 下 的 祭 肉 ， 到 第 三 天 要 用 火 焚 烧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. \\n\\n [bbe] But if any of the flesh of the offering is still unused on the third day, it is to be burned with fire. \\n\\n 7:18 [hgb] 第 三 天 若 吃 了 平 安 祭 的 肉 ， 这 祭 必 不 蒙 悦 纳 ， 人 所 献 的 也 不 算 为 祭 ， 反 为 可 憎 嫌 的 ， 吃 这 祭 肉 的 ， 就 必 担 当 他 的 罪 孽 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. \\n\\n [bbe] And if any of the flesh of the peace-offering is taken as food on the third day, it will not be pleasing to God and will not be put to the account of him who gives it; it will be unclean and a cause of sin to him who takes it as food. \\n\\n 7:19 [hgb] 挨 了 污 秽 物 的 肉 就 不 可 吃 ， 要 用 火 焚 烧 。 至 于 平 安 祭 的 肉 ， 凡 洁 净 的 人 都 要 吃 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof. \\n\\n [bbe] And flesh touched by any unclean thing may not be taken for food: it is to be burned with fire; and as for the flesh of the peace-offerings, everyone who is clean may take it as food: \\n\\n 7:20 [hgb] 只 是 献 与 耶 和 华 平 安 祭 的 肉 ， 人 若 不 洁 净 而 吃 了 ， 这 人 必 从 民 中 剪 除 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. \\n\\n [bbe] But he who is unclean when he takes as food the flesh of the peace-offerings, which are the Lord\u0027s, will be cut off from his people. \\n\\n 7:21 [hgb] 有 人 摸 了 什 么 不 洁 净 的 物 ， 或 是 人 的 不 洁 净 ， 或 是 不 洁 净 的 牲 畜 ， 或 是 不 洁 可 憎 之 物 ， 吃 了 献 与 耶 和 华 平 安 祭 的 肉 ， 这 人 必 从 民 中 剪 除 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. \\n\\n [bbe] And anyone who, after touching any unclean thing of man or an unclean beast or any unclean and disgusting thing, takes as food the flesh of the peace-offerings, which are the Lord\u0027s, will be cut off from his people. \\n\\n 7:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, \\n\\n 7:23 [hgb] 你 晓 谕 以 色 列 人 说 ， 牛 的 脂 油 ， 绵 羊 的 脂 油 ， 山 羊 的 脂 油 ， 你 们 都 不 可 吃 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat. \\n\\n [bbe] Say to the children of Israel: You are not to take any fat, of ox or sheep or goat, for food. \\n\\n 7:24 [hgb] 自 死 的 和 被 野 兽 撕 裂 的 ， 那 脂 油 可 以 作 别 的 使 用 ， 只 是 你 们 万 不 可 吃 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it. \\n\\n [bbe] And the fat of that which comes to a natural death, and the fat of that which is attacked by beasts, may be used for other purposes, but not in any way for food. \\n\\n 7:25 [hgb] 无 论 何 人 吃 了 献 给 耶 和 华 当 火 祭 牲 畜 的 脂 油 ， 那 人 必 从 民 中 剪 除 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. \\n\\n [bbe] For anyone who takes as food the fat of any beast of which men make an offering by fire to the Lord, will be cut off from his people. \\n\\n 7:26 [hgb] 在 你 们 一 切 的 住 处 ， 无 论 是 雀 鸟 的 血 是 野 兽 的 血 ， 你 们 都 不 可 吃 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. \\n\\n [bbe] And you are not to take for food any blood, of bird or of beast, in any of your houses. \\n\\n 7:27 [hgb] 无 论 是 谁 吃 血 ， 那 人 必 从 民 中 剪 除 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. \\n\\n [bbe] Whoever takes any blood for food will be cut off from his people. \\n\\n 7:28 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, \\n\\n 7:29 [hgb] 你 晓 谕 以 色 列 人 说 ， 献 平 安 祭 给 耶 和 华 的 ， 要 从 平 安 祭 中 取 些 来 奉 给 耶 和 华 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. \\n\\n [bbe] Say to the children of Israel: He who makes a peace-offering to the Lord, is to give an offering to the Lord out of his peace-offering: \\n\\n 7:30 [hgb] 他 亲 手 献 给 耶 和 华 的 火 祭 ， 就 是 脂 油 和 胸 ， 要 带 来 ， 好 把 胸 在 耶 和 华 面 前 作 摇 祭 ， 摇 一 摇 。 \\n\\n [kjv] His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] He himself is to take to the Lord the offering made by fire, even the fat with the breast, so that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord. \\n\\n 7:31 [hgb] 祭 司 要 把 脂 油 在 坛 上 焚 烧 ， 但 胸 要 归 亚 伦 和 他 的 子 孙 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron\u0027s and his sons\u0027. \\n\\n [bbe] And the fat is to be burned by the priest on the altar, but the breast is for Aaron and his sons. \\n\\n 7:32 [hgb] 你 们 要 从 平 安 祭 中 把 右 腿 作 举 祭 ， 奉 给 祭 司 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. \\n\\n [bbe] And the right leg you are to give to the priest for an offering to be lifted up out of what is given for your peace-offerings. \\n\\n 7:33 [hgb] 亚 伦 子 孙 中 ， 献 平 安 祭 牲 血 和 脂 油 的 ， 要 得 这 右 腿 为 分 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part. \\n\\n [bbe] That man, among the sons of Aaron, by whom the blood of the peace-offering and the fat are offered, is to have the right leg for his part. \\n\\n 7:34 [hgb] 因 为 我 从 以 色 列 人 的 平 安 祭 中 ， 取 了 这 摇 的 胸 和 举 的 腿 给 祭 司 亚 伦 和 他 子 孙 ， 作 他 们 从 以 色 列 人 中 所 永 得 的 分 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] For the breast which is waved and the right leg which is lifted up on high I have taken from the children of Israel, from their peace-offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their right for ever from the children of Israel. \\n\\n 7:35 [hgb] 这 是 从 耶 和 华 火 祭 中 ， 作 亚 伦 受 膏 的 分 和 他 子 孙 受 膏 的 分 ， 正 在 摩 西 （ 原 文 作 他 ） 叫 他 们 前 来 给 耶 和 华 供 祭 司 职 分 的 日 子 ， \\n\\n [kjv] This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest\u0027s office; \\n\\n [bbe] This is the holy part given to Aaron and to his sons, out of the offerings made to the Lord by fire, on the day when they were made priests before the Lord; \\n\\n 7:36 [hgb] 就 是 在 摩 西 （ 原 文 作 他 ） 膏 他 们 的 日 子 ， 耶 和 华 吩 咐 以 色 列 人 给 他 们 的 。 这 是 他 们 世 世 代 代 永 得 的 分 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations. \\n\\n [bbe] Which the Lord said the children of Israel were to give them, on the day when he made them his priests. It is their right for ever from generation to generation. \\n\\n 7:37 [hgb] 这 就 是 燔 祭 ， 素 祭 ， 赎 罪 祭 ， 赎 愆 祭 ， 和 平 安 祭 的 条 例 ， 并 承 接 圣 职 的 礼 ， \\n\\n [kjv] This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; \\n\\n [bbe] These are the laws for the burned offering, the meal offering, and the offering for wrongdoing; and for the making of priests, and for the giving of peace-offerings; \\n\\n 7:38 [hgb] 都 是 耶 和 华 在 西 乃 山 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 ， 就 是 他 在 西 乃 旷 野 吩 咐 以 色 列 人 献 供 物 给 耶 和 华 之 日 所 说 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai. \\n\\n [bbe] As they were given by the Lord to Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day when the Lord gave orders to the children of Israel to make their offerings to the Lord, in the waste land of Sinai. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19/437.html","bookId":241,"book":{"id":241,"title":"Leviticus利未记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shal...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
