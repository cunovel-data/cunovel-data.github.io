{"id":7361,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"9:1 [hgb] 到 了 第 八 天 ， 摩 西 召 了 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 ， 并 以 色 列 的 众 长 老 来 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; \n [bbe] And on the eighth day Moses sent for Aaron and his sons and the responsible men of Israel; \n 9:2 [hgb] 对 亚 伦 说 ， 你 当 取 牛 群 中 的 一 只 公 牛 犊 作 赎 罪 祭 ， 一 只 公 绵 羊 作 燔 祭 ， 都 要 没 有 残 疾 的 ， 献 在 耶 和 华 面 前 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD. \n [bbe] And he said to Aaron, Take a young ox for a sin-offering and a male sheep for a burned offering, without a mark, and make an offering of them before the Lord. \n 9:3 [hgb] 你 也 要 对 以 色 列 人 说 ， 你 们 当 取 一 只 公 山 羊 作 赎 罪 祭 ， 又 取 一 只 牛 犊 和 一 只 绵 羊 羔 ， 都 要 一 岁 ， 没 有 残 疾 的 ， 作 燔 祭 ， \n [kjv] And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; \n [bbe] And say to the children of Israel: Take a he-goat for a sin-offering, and a young ox and a lamb, in their first year, without any mark on them, for a burned offering; \n 9:4 [hgb] 又 取 一 只 公 牛 ， 一 只 公 绵 羊 作 平 安 祭 ， 献 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 并 取 调 油 的 素 祭 ， 因 为 今 天 耶 和 华 要 向 你 们 显 现 。 \n [kjv] Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you. \n [bbe] And an ox and a male sheep for peace-offerings, to be put to death before the Lord; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for this day you are to see the Lord. \n 9:5 [hgb] 于 是 他 们 把 摩 西 所 吩 咐 的 ， 带 到 会 幕 前 ， 全 会 众 都 近 前 来 ， 站 在 耶 和 华 面 前 。 \n [kjv] And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. \n [bbe] And they took the things ordered by Moses, before the Tent of meeting, and all the people came near, waiting before the Lord. \n 9:6 [hgb] 摩 西 说 ， 这 是 耶 和 华 吩 咐 你 们 所 当 行 的 ， 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 就 要 向 你 们 显 现 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you. \n [bbe] And Moses said, This is what the Lord has said you are to do; and you will see the glory of the Lord. \n 9:7 [hgb] 摩 西 对 亚 伦 说 ， 你 就 近 坛 前 ， 献 你 的 赎 罪 祭 和 燔 祭 ， 为 自 己 与 百 姓 赎 罪 ， 又 献 上 百 姓 的 供 物 ， 为 他 们 赎 罪 ， 都 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded. \n [bbe] And Moses said to Aaron, Come near to the altar and make your sin-offering and your burned offering to take away your sin and the sin of the people, and make the people\u0027s offering to take away their sin; as the Lord has given orders. \n 9:8 [hgb] 于 是 ， 亚 伦 就 近 坛 前 ， 宰 了 为 自 己 作 赎 罪 祭 的 牛 犊 。 \n [kjv] Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. \n [bbe] So Aaron came near to the altar and put to death the ox for the sin-offering for himself; \n 9:9 [hgb] 亚 伦 的 儿 子 把 血 奉 给 他 ， 他 就 把 指 头 蘸 在 血 中 ， 抹 在 坛 的 四 角 上 ， 又 把 血 倒 在 坛 脚 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: \n [bbe] And the sons of Aaron gave him the blood and he put his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar, draining out the blood at the base of the altar; \n 9:10 [hgb] 惟 有 赎 罪 祭 的 脂 油 和 腰 子 ， 并 肝 上 取 的 网 子 ， 都 烧 在 坛 上 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 。 \n [kjv] But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] But the fat and the kidneys and the fat on the liver of the sin-offering were burned by him on the altar as the Lord gave orders to Moses. \n 9:11 [hgb] 又 用 火 将 肉 和 皮 烧 在 营 外 。 \n [kjv] And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. \n [bbe] And the flesh and the skin were burned with fire outside the tent-circle; \n 9:12 [hgb] 亚 伦 宰 了 燔 祭 牲 ， 他 儿 子 把 血 递 给 他 ， 他 就 洒 在 坛 的 周 围 ， \n [kjv] And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron\u0027s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. \n [bbe] And he put to death the burned offering; and Aaron\u0027s sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar; \n 9:13 [hgb] 又 把 燔 祭 一 块 一 块 地 ， 连 头 递 给 他 ， 他 都 烧 在 坛 上 。 \n [kjv] And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. \n [bbe] And they gave him the parts of the burned offering, in their order, and the head, to be burned on the altar. \n 9:14 [hgb] 又 洗 了 脏 腑 和 腿 ， 烧 在 坛 上 的 燔 祭 上 。 \n [kjv] And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar. \n [bbe] And the inside parts and the legs, when they had been washed with water, were burned on the burned offering on the altar. \n 9:15 [hgb] 他 奉 上 百 姓 的 供 物 ， 把 那 给 百 姓 作 赎 罪 祭 的 公 山 羊 宰 了 ， 为 罪 献 上 ， 和 先 献 的 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And he brought the people\u0027s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. \n [bbe] And he made an offering for the people and took the goat of the sin-offering for the people and put it to death, offering it for sin, in the same way as the first. \n 9:16 [hgb] 也 奉 上 燔 祭 ， 照 例 而 献 。 \n [kjv] And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner. \n [bbe] And he took the burned offering, offering it in the ordered way; \n 9:17 [hgb] 他 又 奉 上 素 祭 ， 从 其 中 取 一 满 把 ， 烧 在 坛 上 ， 这 是 在 早 晨 的 燔 祭 以 外 。 \n [kjv] And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning. \n [bbe] And he put the meal offering before the Lord, and taking some of it in his hand he had it burned on the altar, separately from the burned offering of the morning. \n 9:18 [hgb] 亚 伦 宰 了 那 给 百 姓 作 平 安 祭 的 公 牛 和 公 绵 羊 。 他 儿 子 把 血 递 给 他 ， 他 就 洒 在 坛 的 周 围 。 \n [kjv] He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron\u0027s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, \n [bbe] And he put to death the ox and the sheep, which were the peace-offerings for the people; and Aaron\u0027s sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar; \n 9:19 [hgb] 又 把 公 牛 和 公 绵 羊 的 脂 油 ， 肥 尾 巴 ， 并 盖 脏 的 脂 油 与 腰 子 ， 和 肝 上 的 网 子 ， 都 递 给 他 。 \n [kjv] And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver: \n [bbe] And as for the fat of the ox and the fat tail of the sheep and the fat covering the inside parts and the kidneys and the fat on the liver; \n 9:20 [hgb] 把 脂 油 放 在 胸 上 ， 他 就 把 脂 油 烧 在 坛 上 。 \n [kjv] And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: \n [bbe] They put the fat on the breasts, and the fat was burned on the altar. \n 9:21 [hgb] 胸 和 右 腿 ， 亚 伦 当 作 摇 祭 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 摇 一 摇 ， 都 是 照 摩 西 所 吩 咐 的 。 \n [kjv] And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded. \n [bbe] And Aaron took the breasts and the right leg, waving them for a wave offering before the Lord, as Moses gave orders. \n 9:22 [hgb] 亚 伦 向 百 姓 举 手 ， 为 他 们 祝 福 。 他 献 了 赎 罪 祭 ， 燔 祭 ， 平 安 祭 就 下 来 了 。 \n [kjv] And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings. \n [bbe] And Aaron, lifting up his hands to the people, gave them a blessing; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burned offering, and the peace-offerings. \n 9:23 [hgb] 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 进 入 会 幕 ， 又 出 来 为 百 姓 祝 福 ， 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 就 向 众 民 显 现 。 \n [kjv] And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people. \n [bbe] And Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of meeting, and came out and gave the people a blessing, and the glory of the Lord was seen by all the people. \n 9:24 [hgb] 有 火 从 耶 和 华 面 前 出 来 ， 在 坛 上 烧 尽 燔 祭 和 脂 油 ， 众 民 一 见 ， 就 都 欢 呼 ， 俯 伏 在 地 。 \n [kjv] And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces. \n [bbe] And fire came out from before the Lord, burning up the offering on the altar and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they gave a loud cry, falling down on their faces. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19/439.html","bookId":241,"book":{"id":241,"title":"Leviticus利未记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shal...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
