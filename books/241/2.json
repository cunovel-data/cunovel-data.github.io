and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon: \n [bbe] And when anyone makes a meal offering to the Lord, let his offering be of the best meal, with oil on it and perfume: \n 2:2 [hgb] 带 到 亚 伦 子 孙 作 祭 司 的 那 里 ， 祭 司 就 要 从 细 面 中 取 出 一 把 来 ， 并 取 些 油 和 所 有 的 乳 香 ， 然 后 要 把 所 取 的 这 些 作 为 纪 念 ， 烧 在 坛 上 ， 是 献 与 耶 和 华 为 馨 香 的 火 祭 。 \n [kjv] And he shall bring it to Aaron\u0027s sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: \n [bbe] And let him take it to Aaron\u0027s sons, the priests; and having taken in his hand some of the meal and of the oil, with all the perfume, let him give it to the priest to be burned on the altar, as a sign, an offering made by fire, for a sweet smell to the Lord. \n 2:3 [hgb] 素 祭 所 剩 的 要 归 给 亚 伦 和 他 的 子 孙 ， 这 是 献 与 耶 和 华 的 火 祭 中 为 至 圣 的 。 \n [kjv] And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron\u0027s and his sons\u0027: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. \n [bbe] And the rest of the meal offering will be for Aaron and his sons; it is most holy among the Lord\u0027s fire offerings. \n 2:4 [hgb] 若 用 炉 中 烤 的 物 为 素 祭 ， 就 要 用 调 油 的 无 酵 细 面 饼 ， 或 是 抹 油 的 无 酵 薄 饼 。 \n [kjv] And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. \n [bbe] And when you give a meal offering cooked in the oven, let it be of unleavened cakes of the best meal mixed with oil, or thin unleavened cakes covered with oil. \n 2:5 [hgb] 若 用 铁 鏊 上 作 的 物 为 素 祭 ， 就 要 用 调 油 的 无 酵 细 面 ， \n [kjv] And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. \n [bbe] And if you give a meal offering cooked on a flat plate, let it be of the best meal, unleavened and mixed with oil. \n 2:6 [hgb] 分 成 块 子 ， 浇 上 油 ， 这 是 素 祭 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering. \n [bbe] Let it be broken into bits, and put oil on it; it is a meal offering. \n 2:7 [hgb] 若 用 煎 盘 作 的 物 为 素 祭 ， 就 要 用 油 与 细 面 作 成 。 \n [kjv] And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. \n [bbe] And if your offering is of meal cooked in fat over the fire, let it be made of the best meal mixed with oil. \n 2:8 [hgb] 要 把 这 些 东 西 作 的 素 祭 带 到 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 并 奉 给 祭 司 ， 带 到 坛 前 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar. \n [bbe] And you are to give the meal offering made of these things to the Lord, and let the priest take it to the altar. \n 2:9 [hgb] 祭 司 要 从 素 祭 中 取 出 作 为 纪 念 的 ， 烧 在 坛 上 ， 是 献 与 耶 和 华 为 馨 香 的 火 祭 。 \n [kjv] And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. \n [bbe] And he is to take from the meal offering a part, for a sign, burning it on the altar; an offering made by fire for a sweet smell to the Lord. \n 2:10 [hgb] 素 祭 所 剩 的 要 归 给 亚 伦 和 他 的 子 孙 。 这 是 献 与 耶 和 华 的 火 祭 中 为 至 圣 的 。 \n [kjv] And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron\u0027s and his sons\u0027: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. \n [bbe] And the rest of the meal offering will be for Aaron and his sons; it is most holy among the Lord\u0027s fire offerings. \n 2:11 [hgb] 凡 献 给 耶 和 华 的 素 祭 都 不 可 有 酵 ， 因 为 你 们 不 可 烧 一 点 酵 ， 一 点 蜜 当 作 火 祭 献 给 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire. \n [bbe] No meal offering which you give to the Lord is to be made with leaven; no leaven or honey is to be burned as an offering made by fire to the Lord. \n 2:12 [hgb] 这 些 物 要 献 给 耶 和 华 作 为 初 熟 的 供 物 ， 只 是 不 可 在 坛 上 献 为 馨 香 的 祭 。 \n [kjv] As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour. \n [bbe] You may give them as an offering of first-fruits to the Lord, but they are not to go up as a sweet smell on the altar. \n 2:13 [hgb] 凡 献 为 素 祭 的 供 物 都 要 用 盐 调 和 ， 在 素 祭 上 不 可 缺 了 你 神 立 约 的 盐 。 一 切 的 供 物 都 要 配 盐 而 献 。 \n [kjv] And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. \n [bbe] And every meal offering is to be salted with salt; your meal offering is not to be without the salt of the agreement of your God: with all your offerings give salt. \n 2:14 [hgb] 若 向 耶 和 华 献 初 熟 之 物 为 素 祭 ， 要 献 上 烘 了 的 禾 穗 子 ， 就 是 轧 了 的 新 穗 子 ， 当 作 初 熟 之 物 的 素 祭 。 \n [kjv] And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears. \n [bbe] And if you give a meal offering of first-fruits to the Lord, give, as your offering of first-fruits, new grain, made dry with fire, crushed new grain. \n 2:15 [hgb] 并 要 抹 上 油 ， 加 上 乳 香 ， 这 是 素 祭 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering. \n [bbe] And put oil on it and perfume: it is a meal offering. \n 2:16 [hgb] 祭 司 要 把 其 中 作 为 纪 念 的 ， 就 是 一 些 轧 了 的 禾 穗 子 和 一 些 油 ， 并 所 有 的 乳 香 ， 都 焚 烧 ， 是 向 耶 和 华 献 的 火 祭 。 \n [kjv] And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. \n [bbe] And part of the meal of the offering and part of the oil and all the perfume is to be burned for a sign by the priest: it is an offering made by fire to the Lord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19/332.html","bookId":241,"book":{"id":241,"title":"Leviticus利未记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shal...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
