\n [bbe] If anyone does wrong, and is untrue to the Lord, acting falsely to his neighbour in connection with something put in his care, or something given for a debt, or has taken away anything by force, or has been cruel to his neighbour, \n 6:3 [hgb] 或 是 在 捡 了 遗 失 的 物 上 行 了 诡 诈 ， 说 谎 起 誓 ， 在 这 一 切 的 事 上 犯 了 什 么 罪 。 \n [kjv] Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: \n [bbe] Or has taken a false oath about the loss of something which he has come across by chance; if a man has done any of these evil things, \n 6:4 [hgb] 他 既 犯 了 罪 ， 有 了 过 犯 ， 就 要 归 还 他 所 抢 夺 的 ， 或 是 因 欺 压 所 得 的 ， 或 是 人 交 付 他 的 ， 或 是 人 遗 失 他 所 捡 的 物 ， \n [kjv] Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found, \n [bbe] Causing sin to come on him, then he will have to give back the thing he took by force or got by cruel acts, or the goods which were put in his care or the thing he came on by chance, \n 6:5 [hgb] 或 是 他 因 什 么 物 起 了 假 誓 ， 就 要 如 数 归 还 ， 另 外 加 上 五 分 之 一 ， 在 查 出 他 有 罪 的 日 子 要 交 还 本 主 。 \n [kjv] Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering. \n [bbe] Or anything about which he took a false oath; he will have to give it all back, with the addition of a fifth of its value, to him whose property it is, when he has been judged to be in the wrong. \n 6:6 [hgb] 也 要 照 你 所 估 定 的 价 ， 把 赎 愆 祭 牲 就 是 羊 群 中 一 只 没 有 残 疾 的 公 绵 羊 牵 到 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 给 祭 司 为 赎 愆 祭 。 \n [kjv] And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: \n [bbe] Then let him take to the Lord the offering for his wrongdoing; giving to the priest for his offering, a male sheep from the flock, without any mark, of the value fixed by you: \n 6:7 [hgb] 祭 司 要 在 耶 和 华 面 前 为 他 赎 罪 ， 他 无 论 行 了 什 么 事 ， 使 他 有 了 罪 ， 都 必 蒙 赦 免 。 \n [kjv] And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein. \n [bbe] And the priest will take away his sin from before the Lord, and he will have forgiveness for whatever crime he has done \n 6:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， \n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, \n 6:9 [hgb] 你 要 吩 咐 亚 伦 和 他 的 子 孙 说 ， 燔 祭 的 条 例 乃 是 这 样 ， 燔 祭 要 放 在 坛 的 柴 上 ， 从 晚 上 到 天 亮 ， 坛 上 的 火 要 常 常 烧 着 。 \n [kjv] Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it. \n [bbe] Give orders to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law for the burned offering: the offering is to be on the fire-wood on the altar all night till the morning; and the fire of the altar is to be kept burning. \n 6:10 [hgb] 祭 司 要 穿 上 细 麻 布 衣 服 ， 又 要 把 细 麻 布 裤 子 穿 在 身 上 ， 把 坛 上 所 烧 的 燔 祭 灰 收 起 来 ， 倒 在 坛 的 旁 边 。 \n [kjv] And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. \n [bbe] And the priest is to put on his linen robes and his linen trousers, and take up what is over of the offering after it has been burned on the altar, and put it by the side of the altar. \n 6:11 [hgb] 随 后 要 脱 去 这 衣 服 ， 穿 上 别 的 衣 服 ， 把 灰 拿 到 营 外 洁 净 之 处 。 \n [kjv] And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. \n [bbe] Then having taken off his linen robes and put on other clothing, he is to take it away into a clean place, outside the tent-circle. \n 6:12 [hgb] 坛 上 的 火 要 在 其 上 常 常 烧 着 ， 不 可 熄 灭 。 祭 司 要 每 日 早 晨 在 上 面 烧 柴 ， 并 要 把 燔 祭 摆 在 坛 上 ， 在 其 上 烧 平 安 祭 牲 的 脂 油 。 \n [kjv] And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings. \n [bbe] The fire on the altar is to be kept burning; it is never to go out; every morning the priest is to put wood on it, placing the burned offering in order on it, and there the fat of the peace-offering is to be burned. \n 6:13 [hgb] 在 坛 上 必 有 常 常 烧 着 的 火 ， 不 可 熄 灭 。 \n [kjv] The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out. \n [bbe] Let the fire be kept burning on the altar at all times; it is never to go out. \n 6:14 [hgb] 素 祭 的 条 例 乃 是 这 样 ， 亚 伦 的 子 孙 要 在 坛 前 把 这 祭 献 在 耶 和 华 面 前 。 \n [kjv] And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar. \n [bbe] And this is the law for the meal offering: it is to be offered to the Lord before the altar by the sons of Aaron. \n 6:15 [hgb] 祭 司 要 从 其 中 就 是 从 素 祭 的 细 面 中 取 出 自 己 的 一 把 ， 又 要 取 些 油 和 素 祭 上 所 有 的 乳 香 ， 烧 在 坛 上 ， 奉 给 耶 和 华 为 馨 香 素 祭 的 纪 念 。 \n [kjv] And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD. \n [bbe] The priest is to take in his hand some of the meal of the meal offering and of the oil of it, and all the perfume on it, burning it on the altar as a sign, for a sweet smell to the Lord. \n 6:16 [hgb] 所 剩 下 的 ， 亚 伦 和 他 子 孙 要 吃 ， 必 在 圣 处 不 带 酵 而 吃 ， 要 在 会 幕 的 院 子 里 吃 。 \n [kjv] And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it. \n [bbe] And whatever is over Aaron and his sons may have for their food, taking it without leaven in a holy place; in the open space of the Tent of meeting they may take a meal of it. \n 6:17 [hgb] 烤 的 时 候 不 可 搀 酵 。 这 是 从 所 献 给 我 的 火 祭 中 赐 给 他 们 的 分 ， 是 至 圣 的 ， 和 赎 罪 祭 并 赎 愆 祭 一 样 。 \n [kjv] It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering. \n [bbe] It is not to be cooked with leaven. I have given it to them as their part of the offerings made by fire to me; it is most holy, as are the sin-offerings and the offerings for error. \n 6:18 [hgb] 凡 献 给 耶 和 华 的 火 祭 ， 亚 伦 子 孙 中 的 男 丁 都 要 吃 这 一 分 ， 直 到 万 代 ， 作 他 们 永 得 的 分 。 摸 这 些 祭 物 的 ， 都 要 成 为 圣 。 \n [kjv] All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy. \n [bbe] Every male among the children of Aaron may have it for food; it is their right for ever through all your generations, from the offerings made by fire to the Lord: anyone touching them will be holy. \n 6:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， \n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, \n 6:20 [hgb] 当 亚 伦 受 膏 的 日 子 ， 他 和 他 子 孙 所 要 献 给 耶 和 华 的 供 物 ， 就 是 细 面 伊 法 十 分 之 一 ， 为 常 献 的 素 祭 ， 早 晨 一 半 ， 晚 上 一 半 。 \n [kjv] This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night. \n [bbe] This is the offering which Aaron and his sons are to make to the Lord on the day when he is made a priest: the tenth part of an ephah of the best meal for a meal offering for ever; half of it in the morning and half in the evening. \n 6:21 [hgb] 要 在 铁 鏊 上 用 油 调 和 作 成 ， 调 匀 了 ， 你 就 拿 进 来 ， 烤 好 了 分 成 块 子 ， 献 给 耶 和 华 为 馨 香 的 素 祭 。 \n [kjv] In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD. \n [bbe] Let it be made with oil on a flat plate; when it is well mixed and cooked, let it be broken and taken in as a meal offering, for a sweet smell to the Lord. \n 6:22 [hgb] 亚 伦 的 子 孙 中 ， 接 续 他 为 受 膏 的 祭 司 ， 要 把 这 素 祭 献 上 ， 要 全 烧 给 耶 和 华 。 这 是 永 远 的 定 例 。 \n [kjv] And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt. \n [bbe] And the same offering is to be given by that one of his sons who takes his place as priest; by an order for ever, all of it is to be burned before the Lord. \n 6:23 [hgb] 祭 司 的 素 祭 都 要 烧 了 ， 却 不 可 吃 。 \n [kjv] For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten. \n [bbe] Every meal offering offered for the priest is to be completely burned: nothing of it is to be taken for food. \n 6:24 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， \n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, \n 6:25 [hgb] 你 对 亚 伦 和 他 的 子 孙 说 ， 赎 罪 祭 的 条 例 乃 是 这 样 ， 要 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 宰 燔 祭 牲 的 地 方 宰 赎 罪 祭 牲 ， 这 是 至 圣 的 。 \n [kjv] Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy. \n [bbe] Say to Aaron and his sons, This is the law for the sin-offering: the sin-offering is to be put to death before the Lord in the same place as the burned offering; it is most holy. \n 6:26 [hgb] 为 赎 罪 献 这 祭 的 祭 司 要 吃 ， 要 在 圣 处 ， 就 是 在 会 幕 的 院 子 里 吃 。 \n [kjv] The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. \n [bbe] The priest by whom it is offered for sin, is to take it for his food in a holy place, in the open space of the Tent of meeting. \n 6:27 [hgb] 凡 摸 这 祭 肉 的 要 成 为 圣 ， 这 祭 牲 的 血 若 弹 在 什 么 衣 服 上 ， 所 弹 的 那 一 件 要 在 圣 处 洗 净 。 \n [kjv] Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place. \n [bbe] Anyone touching the flesh of it will be holy: and if any of the blood is dropped on any clothing, the thing on which the blood has been dropped is to be washed in a holy place. \n 6:28 [hgb] 惟 有 煮 祭 物 的 瓦 器 要 打 碎 ， 若 是 煮 在 铜 器 里 ， 这 铜 器 要 擦 磨 ， 在 水 中 涮 净 。 \n [kjv] But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water. \n [bbe] But the vessel of earth in which the flesh was cooked is to be broken; or if a brass vessel was used, it is to be rubbed clean and washed out with water. \n 6:29 [hgb] 凡 祭 司 中 的 男 丁 都 可 以 吃 ， 这 是 至 圣 的 。 \n [kjv] All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy. \n [bbe] Every male among the priests may take it for his food: it is most holy. \n 6:30 [hgb] 凡 赎 罪 祭 ， 若 将 血 带 进 会 幕 在 圣 所 赎 罪 ， 那 肉 都 不 可 吃 ， 必 用 火 焚 烧 。 \n [kjv] And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire. \n [bbe] No sin-offering, the blood of which is taken into the Tent of meeting, to take away sin in the holy place, may be used for food: it is to be burned with fire. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19/436.html","bookId":241,"book":{"id":241,"title":"Leviticus利未记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shal...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/19","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
