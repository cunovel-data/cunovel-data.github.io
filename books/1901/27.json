Glorified bean counter.\"\n She shook her head, pushed away from the stoop, crossing her arms under her breasts, feeling the impending evening chill. Marcie had taken the kids around to the front, and she wondered now if her sister had picked up the tone and done it with calculated intent.\n Having the chess pieces rearranged before she could even get a handle on the game was something she didn\u0027t like, and she didn\u0027t want him to think she\u0027d accept being treated that way. \"You know, you can\u0027t call in a babysitter every time you think there\u0027s something you\u0027d rather be doing. That\u0027s not the way this works. I haven\u0027t had time to think this through. And tomorrow is a school day.\"\n \"Hey.\" As he rose, she backed up, not wanting him to touch her again. \"I just wanted the first time between us to be special. Not hurried. You deserve that. And Marcie told me tomorrow is a teacher\u0027s workday. I did check on that first.\" He closed the distance between them in a quick step, caught her shoulders. \"Cass, look at me.\"\n At the command, she raised her angry, uncertain gaze. \"I am not your drunk dad,\" he said. \"If I\u0027m falling for you, I\u0027m falling for the whole package. I had a blast with the kids earlier.\"\n \"They\u0027re not always a blast.\"\n \"Really? I find that hard to believe.\" He gave her that little shake. \"Give me some credit.\"\n \"You\u0027ve only known me a day. You can\u0027t commit your whole life to this—\"\n \"No, of course I can\u0027t. Stop it.\" He held her fast. \"But I can say I\u0027d like a chance. You can\u0027t deny yourself love, the possibility that I could be part of this family, for fear that I can\u0027t.\"\n \"These kids can\u0027t be jerked around anymore. I won\u0027t allow it just because you—\"\n \"If you go with the \u0027just because you want to fuck me\u0027 line, I will smack your ass,\" he said, and the steel in his gaze told her he meant it. \"If that\u0027s all I wanted, I never would have come home with you. Cass, I have a sister. A divorced sister with two kids who had to live with me nearly two years when he cleaned her out of everything, the bastard. I understand the issue, and I love those kids like my own. I took over as the male role model in their life during those two years, and they still look to me that way.\"\n \"They\u0027re doomed,\" she said after a long moment, struggling with it.\n \"Don\u0027t I know it.\" His touch eased. \"You and I have moved fast, way fast. I know that.\n But look at me. Look at my eyes, everything you know of me, that you know of people.\n Use that intuition Steve pays you so much for. If we don\u0027t work out, which I have a very good feeling is not going to be a problem, I will be as careful of the kids\u0027 feelings as I would hope to be of yours. You don\u0027t have to be so goddamned tough about everything.\"\n She wrenched away, crunching through ankle-deep dry leaves in the yard. \"Don\u0027t you get it, Lucas? It\u0027s not about that. Most women aren\u0027t tough. We\u0027re tired, we\u0027re lonely, we\u0027re afraid of failing to live up to what\u0027s expected of us. While we\u0027re looking for the one person who will accept us for ourselves and love us anyway, we\u0027re already too walled up to show him who that is. You can\u0027t let down your shields. No one can.\"\n \"You can with someone who loves you.\"\n \"Yeah, and those people come with big neon signs on them that say, \u0027You can trust me, I will love you through thick and thin, you can count on it.\u0027\" She backed away some more, wishing Marcie hadn\u0027t taken the kids out of earshot, wishing Lucas hadn\u0027t taken off her corset, because words were just bubbling out of her, no filter, no restraint. He was making her need to say them, standing before her, all the possibilities she wanted so much. \"There are things I\u0027ve said in my head I can never say to anyone. Sometimes I\u0027m so tired I don\u0027t want to get up ever again. Sometimes I need sex so badly I\u0027ve brushed against a corner of the kitchen island and made myself come by accident, and had to cover it as a fit of coughing with the kids.\" She laughed bitterly. \"I got them on track, I pay the bills, I\u0027ve earned my education and reputation, and somehow I feel like all I\u0027ve done with my outstanding accomplishments is build myself a great big public cage. And when that becomes too much . . . Ah, Christ.\"\n She turned away, but couldn\u0027t deny his comfort when he slid his arms around her waist, held her against him, speaking into her ear. \"When that becomes too much, you go to a glade in the Berkshires and give yourself twenty minutes of sanity. Everyone feels that way sometimes. But from where I\u0027m standing, you still have a pretty damn good life, you know? You\u0027re fucking amazing, everything you\u0027ve done. You\u0027re just missing someone to share it with, sweetheart. Not just to help, but to share it. We tend to make situations that come with big emotions into something complex, but they\u0027re usually not. Life sucks sometimes, and you need someone who can stand with you. Everyone needs that.\"\n Through a tear-streaked face, she looked up and found his gaze full of a miraculous tenderness. \"I haven\u0027t cried in forever, and here it is, twice with you in one day. That can\u0027t be a good thing.\"\n \"On the contrary, I think it\u0027s a very positive sign. Hell, Cass.\" Turning her, he put his forehead against hers, molded his hands to her back, letting her feel the strength of his touch through his shirt. \"I don\u0027t know what love is, any more than the next person. But I know when I look at you, every part of me is hoping like hell this is it. So risk it, okay?\n You\u0027ve risked so much to get where you are, you\u0027re starting in a position of strength here.\" Lifting his head, he quirked a brow. \"After all, I am a major catch. And I\u0027m completely gone over you.\"\n \"And so modest.\" She sniffled.\n \"Well, first rule of negotiation, sweetheart. Start with the strongest points. Don\u0027t want to scare you off with my bug fetish or the bodies in my basement freezer.\"\n \"Bug fetish?\"\n \"Typical woman. Her eyes go all big over the bugs, rather than my side career as a serial killer.\"\n \"How big? Are we talking spiders? Spiders are not bugs.\"\n Laughing, he pulled her to his mouth and silenced her in a way that forced bugs out of her head.\n She pulled back. \"The kids.\"\n \"Gone.\" At her stunned look, he had the grace to look sheepish. \"I\u0027d already talked to Marcie. She took them in front when I knew the limo would be there.\"\n \"And you just assumed—\"\n \"Yeah, I did.\" He looked down at her. \"You know they\u0027ll be safe with us, right?\"\n \"That\u0027s not the point. I handle my life. Their lives—\"\n \"No question, no argument. But tonight is just for you. You won\u0027t give yourself that. I did. You and I both know you\u0027re using them as a shield.\"\n When he closed his hands on her shoulders, bent his knees to force her to look into his face, she closed her eyes. \"Lucas, I can\u0027t. I get sucked in. For so long, I wanted something like what you appear to be, so much . . .\"\n You\u0027re the Holy Grail floating over the yawning Abyss. With desperation, she thought it must be the Knights of the Boardroom reference making her think in King Arthur analogies. \"Those kids can\u0027t afford a leap of faith. I\u0027m what they have, and in order to be there for them, I can\u0027t risk any cracks. You\u0027re a potential earthquake.\"\n \"I think I\u0027m flattered. But why am I an earthquake?\" Somehow, while her eyes were closed, he\u0027d backed her up against the stoop. As he posed the question in her ear, his arm circled her. Gently, so gently, with his other hand between them, he began to unbutton the shirt, tease her skin.\n \"Because I need you too much. Something like you. You\u0027ll leave. You all leave. Your cocks and minds get bored.\"\n He paused. Cass realized she\u0027d meant to say \"want,\" but they both knew a slip of the tongue like that was rarely a mistake. She couldn\u0027t take it back, couldn\u0027t cover it.\n \"Stop thinking. Just for five minutes, shut it off. Look at me.\" His expression now was one that made something flutter in her lower belly. He nodded. \"Very few men would know that the avenue to your heart is, in fact, through your body, Cass. Through your submission. So the irony of it is, by taking your body exactly where it needs to go, I\u0027m going to convince you that my heart and soul are never going to be bored with you.\"\n She caught at the shirt as he slipped the last button. There were no close neighbors, but that wasn\u0027t why she clutched it. He put his hands over hers, began to pry her fingers away.\n \"I can\u0027t.\" Her whisper was broken. \"I can\u0027t say no to you, but I can\u0027t do this.\"\n \"You\u0027re not your parents, Cass. Either one of them. You\u0027re you. And you can do it.\" He coaxed one set of fingers to release, then the other. Holding her wrists in one hand, he spread the two sides of the shirt open, revealing the flat line of her stomach, the crescent shapes of her breasts. \"Beautiful,\" he murmured. \"Mine. Stand still.\"\n Turning her, he took the coat off her shoulders and then the shirt, laid them on the stoop.\n The skirt came next, slowly sliding over her hips, followed by the panties and stockings, so she now stood naked before him while he was still fully clothed. When she shivered, he put the coat back over her bare shoulders.\n \"Should we go—\"\n \"Not yet,\" he said. Then he sank down before her, hands holding her hips as he studied the column of her throat, the shape of her breasts, the line of her rib cage and abdomen.\n Her hips, the roundness of her buttocks, the vee of her sex, a soft pelt of hair, smooth and trim. He studied that the longest, and aside from the self-consciousness, the slight sense of embarrassment, it aroused her almost to the point of pain, the way he examined her.\n Her hands clutched his shoulders, then slid forward, seeking the line of his jaw. Catching her fingers, he sucked on them hard, strong, before pulling free, staring up at her. \"Mine,\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/controlled-response-knights-of-the-board-room-2/page-27.html","bookId":1901,"book":{"id":1901,"title":"Controlled Response (Knights of the Board Room #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Controlled Response (Knights of the Board Room #2) \n Lucas Adler has recently realized he wants more from a relationship than just fantastic sex.
