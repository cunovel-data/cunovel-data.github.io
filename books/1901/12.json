Maybe she should be late tomorrow.\n As Ben guided her out the door, he threw an enigmatic expression over his shoulder.\n When it closed after them, silence reigned for a long moment. Peter glanced at Jon. Jon looked toward Matt, who was studying the stone passive face of his CFO.\n \"If you wait too long, Ben will drive off with her,\" he observed at last, sitting down on the desk.\n \"No, he won\u0027t. He\u0027ll stall at his car, if he values his balls.\" Lucas directed his next comment toward Peter and Jon. \"I may have need of the three of you tomorrow on this. If you can wait a few moments, I\u0027ll come back and explain the details shortly.\" His gaze shifted. \"Matt, it\u0027s probably best if you\u0027re not privy to it.\"\n \"One of the very few drawbacks to being married,\" Matt noted, but shook his head. \"I\u0027ll take the risk. I\u0027d like to hear the discussion. We\u0027ll wait on you. I assume you\u0027ll bring Ben back up with you. Intact, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\n Lucas gave a feral smile and slid out the door. Once out of sight, he took the stairs, glad for carpeted hallways to mask the sound of sprinting feet. As well as for the shape he was in, so he wouldn\u0027t be wheezing like an asthmatic once he got to the parking deck.\n As he expected, Ben did have her at his Mercedes McLaren Roadster, in its assigned place in the parking deck. He was propped against the car door, about two steps too close to her as he gestured through the opening of the parking deck at the building across the way. Probably explaining how Savannah worked at that building, or some other smooth lawyer talk.\n There\u0027d been no prearrangement to Bens delay. Lucas knew he\u0027d still be here, just as he knew what was said about the five of them, both informally as well as in the many articles that had been written. That they were in tune with one another like a wolf pack.\n However, someone else had called them the Knights of the Board Room, because they had an unbreakable honor code when it came to business associates, community giving.\n But the code was much more personal than that. Ben knew Lucas had marked Cass as his.\n As well as he knew what her power play was about and, being a gentleman, had played along. A little too enthusiastically for Lucas\u0027s tastes, but then Ben did like to yank his chain. Lucas made a mental note to have Jon mix up the numbers this month so it looked as if Legal was about 200 percent over their annual budget.\n \"Lucas,\" Ben straightened from the car, arching a brow. \"Is there a problem?\"\n \"Matt needs us all upstairs. Something just came up at the Seattle plant. I would have buzzed you, but your cell apparently doesn\u0027t work in the parking garage.\"\n \"I think I must have turned it off. Wanted to give my full attention to a beautiful woman.\"\n He turned to Cassie. She was doing an excellent job looking unperturbed by the disruption. Good enough that Lucas wanted to toss away the briefcase she was holding in front of her and lay her out on the hood of Ben\u0027s disgustingly expensive car. Wipe every act off her face except the truth of her own desire and sexual nature, a match for his own.\n \"My apologies. Some other time.\" When Ben picked up her hand and gallantly kissed her knuckles, his hand curled over her wrist and palm so that as he pulled away, his fingers slid along her pulse. It never failed to elicit a shudder, and even Cass was no exception. It had to be an involuntary reflex, Lucas reflected darkly. Kind of like smashing a hammer into someone\u0027s knee.\n He gave Ben a tight, I\u0027m-going-to-kick-your-ass smile, which Ben returned with an anytime-you-feel-lucky glint in his eye.\n As Ben left them, Cass reshouldered the briefcase strap. \"Well, then, I\u0027ll just catch a cab and head back to the office to get my car.\" She was keeping an eye on Ben, trying to move past Lucas, for he knew as well as she did that she didn\u0027t want Ben to get out of sight.\n \"You didn\u0027t mention your evening plans were with Ben, when we were in the restroom.\"\n While he made the comment mildly, when she shifted, he moved to block her. \"Though I admit I did keep you a little preoccupied. I\u0027m also surprised you didn\u0027t offer me dinner. I worked at least as hard on the financial piece as Ben did on crafting his usual bullshit.\"\n \"Taking Ben to dinner is a business courtesy you should understand. And I\u0027ve offered you as much as I\u0027m going to.\" Her eyes flashed blue fire. \"You\u0027re pushing it, Lucas.\"\n \"Funny, that\u0027s what I was going to say to you.\" Then, going with inexplicable fury instead of reason, he trapped her against the car, closing his hand over the briefcase. Yanking it away from her, he dropped it to the asphalt as he cupped her head and dived in, covering her mouth with his.\n He was vaguely aware of the chirp that cut short the startling blast of an alarm. Ben, probably at the elevators just around the corner, had been astute enough to hit the security alarm just as Lucas pushed against her, hard enough to rock the light-bodied car. Okay, maybe he\u0027d only show him as 100% over budget.\n So she didn\u0027t want to touch him. She didn\u0027t want to remove the corset. She was doing everything she could to manage the situation, control it. Taking Ben to dinner, letting him flirt with her, just to tick him off. Well, she was touching him now, from chest to groin, and Lucas pushed himself against her harder, yanking at her skirt so he could pull one of her legs up and around him, put himself firmly against her bare pussy.\n She made one of those maddening noises in the back of her throat, which he answered with a triumphant growl of his own when she let loose and kissed him back, her hands sliding along the short hair of his skull, nails digging in.\n Too soon, she stiffened, tore her mouth away. \"Just because my cunt says yes, it doesn\u0027t mean anything.\"\n He jerked her head back so he could stare into her face, make her meet his gaze. \"How about your racing heart? The breath sobbing in your throat because you won\u0027t let yourself draw a deep, real breath? Just when do you take the corset off, Cassie?\"\n \"I\u0027m Cassandra, not Cassie,\" she snapped the reminder. \"Cassie is a girl\u0027s name. A little girl.\"\n He remembered Savannah saying once that men were always boys when it came to the women they wanted. And a woman\u0027s heart pounded like a girl for the boy she wanted. He wanted to believe that was why Cass\u0027s was pumping madly for him.\n \"You\u0027re my girl.\" He changed the hard grip on her hair into something different, loosening the barrette and letting it ping off the side of the car as he stroked his hand through the thick pelt of it, moving his thumbs over her lips. Her hands gripped his forearms, conveying uncertainty with the switch to tenderness. She was rigid, ready to stave off an attack.\n Rocking up to his toes because of her heels, he put his chin on her head, emphasizing the difference in heights. \"See. My little girl.\" He could feel the softness of her full breasts, straining over the hold of that ribbed cage she\u0027d designed for herself.\n \"Idiot,\" she muttered. \"I\u0027m not little. I\u0027m tall.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t deny the mine part.\"\n \"It didn\u0027t dignify an answer.\"\n \"Or maybe you liked the sound of it.\"\n She pushed back from him then, her expression sobering. \"Lucas, I told you, I\u0027m not going to deny we have some chemistry. Hell, if I can arrange my schedule, you might even talk me into checking into a hotel room for a few hours tomorrow to get it out of our system, split the bill, but that\u0027s it. The finish line.\"\n Did she realize he could read her? That her eyes told him how much more she wanted?\n What she wouldn\u0027t give herself? Pressing his body against hers again, this time he laid a hand on her throat, thumb passing over the sensitive network of bones and thudding arteries there. \"Don\u0027t write a good deal off before it even hits the table, because you\u0027re afraid of how it might change things in your life.\"\n \"I don\u0027t have room for you in my life, Lucas. If you really knew me, you wouldn\u0027t want to be part of it anyway.\"\n She bit her lip as if she hadn\u0027t meant to say that. But Lucas tilted her chin up. \"I don\u0027t know it all, but I\u0027ve figured a couple things out. You\u0027ve worked hard on it, so it doesn\u0027t come through often, but there are some inflections in your speech which suggest you came from a poor Baton Rouge family.\" At her stunned look, he raised the hand wearing his Yale class ring. \"Linguistics was part of my studies. I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s why you don\u0027t like being called Cassie. Maybe the last time people called you that was when nothing was expected from you but becoming some drunk guy\u0027s Friday night punching bag and breeder.\"\n Muttering an expletive, she tried to pull away, but he gave her a little shake, commanding her attention again. \"The five of us come from diverse backgrounds. But the one thing we all respect is a person who worked her ass off—your own words—who didn\u0027t whine and ask for handouts, but managed to make a success of herself.\n \"I\u0027d love to hear your story,\" he said sincerely. \"I\u0027d love to get to know you. Whether you want to admit it or not, it wasn\u0027t just sex. You think every guy gets the privilege of stumbling upon a gorgeous woman stretched out on a Harley in nothing but a corset and panties? And then has her show up in his conference room a month later?\"\n She made a desperate sound. \"That doesn\u0027t make the problems any simpler.\"\n \"Well, tell me, then. If its something I can\u0027t handle, then fine. I\u0027ll take you up on the wild monkey hotel sex. But I\u0027ll pay the bill. I\u0027m old-fashioned that way.\"\n She blinked, then let out a chuckle that disturbed him with its note of weariness. \"You\u0027re better than I expected you to be, Lucas.\"\n \"I assume you mean in terms of kindness. Not my overwhelming sexual prowess.\"\n She gave him a narrow look, but then averted her glance. He noted her swallow, her sudden discomfort. \"About the restraints and all, earlier. I mean, I do fantasize, but that\u0027s not really me.\"\n \"Yeah, it is.\" Guiding her face back, he made her hold his gaze. She belied her own words with the tremor that went through her at the demanding touch. \"You\u0027re just embarrassed by it. Don\u0027t ever apologize for the way you like to be pleasured. I\u0027m very much a Dominant when it comes to sex, if you hadn\u0027t noticed. You think I don\u0027t recognize a compatible match? I won\u0027t let you lie to me about that. It is what it is, and we\u0027ll let that unfold the way it needs to. All right?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/controlled-response-knights-of-the-board-room-2/page-12.html","bookId":1901,"book":{"id":1901,"title":"Controlled Response (Knights of the Board Room #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Controlled Response (Knights of the Board Room #2) \n Lucas Adler has recently realized he wants more from a relationship than just fantastic sex.
