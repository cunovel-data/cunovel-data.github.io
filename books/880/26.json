{"id":34676,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI IN CAPTIVITY","content":"After the excitement of that day and night came five days of quiet--quiet at least for Captain and Mrs. Burton, held prisoners as they were in a Boer house on the slope of a rocky hill sparsely covered with grass. It was the homestead of a sheep farm and the animals fed amongst the hills, and, when the seasons served, down on the plain. The stone house was solidly built; it was of one storey, with a roof of corrugated iron, and was comfortable enough after the Dutch fashion, so that on the whole Brenda and her husband were not unpleasantly situated. More over they were allowed to be together--a privilege which they valued highly. Indeed, it was the sole thing which rendered this captivity tolerable. \\n\\n \\n\\n As it happened, Piet Bok was unable to send them to Pretoria as he had wished. The Boers were now engaged with Buller\u0027s division, and were falling back to a hill called Spion Kop, a name hardly known at that time, but fated in two or three days to be spoken of all over the world. Not a burgher could be spared to escort them to the capital, but, strangely enough, a sufficient number were told off to guard the farm house. Harold was somewhat suspicious of this arrangement--suspicious that somehow Van Zwieten had had to do with it; but he had no means of making certain. The Dutchman had never come near them, but they feared him all the more now that he was out of sight, and fully expected some fresh trouble. As he had warned Mrs. Burton, he had not done with them yet. \\n\\n \\n\\n Occasionally they were visited by Piet Bok, and the old man still seemed as kindly disposed as ever, but as yet he could do nothing to help them; so for five days they had to make the best of their irksome captivity. Not even a book or a paper could they find. However, putting aside the constant dread of Van Zwieten, they were not unhappy. The house stood so high that there was a splendid view of a large plain, and on the left a huddle of hills. Beyond these the fighting was going on, and the prisoners could hear the boom of the cannon and the shriek of shells. At times they could see the smoke of the battle afar off. Harold hoped that the advance of the army would bring them help at last, but the fighting was in a more westerly direction, and the hoped-for help never came. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If we could only escape, Brenda!\" he said for the hundredth time. \"It is maddening to be shut up here and to listen to all that! We must make one desperate attempt to get away. You are not afraid, I know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am not afraid,\" replied his wife, \"but we must not be rash. We have no weapons, no horses, no food. I don\u0027t see how we are to manage it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nor do I, unless Piet Bok will help us. These men outside would give us no quarter if we tried to get away. They are just dying to get rid of us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Brenda shuddered. \"Harold, don\u0027t! It is terrible to think of. I feel sure all will come right in the end.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It won\u0027t if Van Zwieten can help it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He will have enough to do to look after himself. Harold, that man will die!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you know? Do you mean a violent death, and that soon?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, that is just what I do mean. My mother was a Highland woman, and had what they call second-sight. I have not got it myself, I suppose, because I am not a pure Celt. But I have enough of the seer in me to have a presentiment about that man! I feel certain that he will die by violence, and that shortly. I can\u0027t explain myself more clearly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One never can explain a feeling of that sort. You told this to Van Zwieten himself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, and I frightened him. Perhaps that is why he has not been near us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should not have thought he was superstitious, Brenda; nor you either, for that matter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am not, as a rule,\" was her reply, \"but I feel that what I say is true. Van Zwieten will die!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Harold, sturdy, stolid Englishman as he was, tried to argue her out of this idea, but he gave it up as hopeless. She had made up her mind that their enemy was a dead man, or would be dead within a few days. Strange to say, it was on that very day that he paid them his first visit. He looked as handsome and as burly as ever. Going by appearances, he had a good many years of villainy before him yet. \\n\\n \\n\\n He came up to the veranda and saluted Mrs. Burton with a low bow of which she took no notice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are surprised to see me?\" he said, with his usual cool insolence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot say that I am surprised at anything you do,\" was Harold\u0027s disdainful reply. \"But if you have come to make the same proposition you made before, I warn you that I shall not listen to it so patiently.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Dutchman cast a quick glance at the slender figure of the other man. \"I am not afraid of you,\" he sneered; \"you have no weapons--neither sword nor revolver.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can use my fists even on such a big bully as you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As you please. But I don\u0027t see much chance of delivering my message until you moderate your tone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is your message?\" asked Brenda, speaking for the first time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I come to offer you freedom.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On what conditions?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are none. I love you still. If I had my way I would kill your husband and marry you. But unfortunately,\" said Van Zwieten, with a sneer, \"I am amongst a very moral people. Piet Bok has told the Boer generals about what they are pleased to call my wickedness, and I have been informed that if I persist in my plans I may say good-bye to all advancement amongst the godly Boers. Now I am a poor man, and cannot afford to lose all I have gained. Ambition for me must be stronger than love. So, Mrs. Burton, I give you up!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank God!\" cried she, clasping her hands; adding, as an afterthought, \"If I could only believe you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you can believe me,\" he said gloomily. \"If I were only a rich man--rich enough to give up my position here--I would never rest until you were mine. But the choice lies now between you and my position. I choose to lose you. From this moment you need have no fear of me. You can go with your husband where you will. You do not love me--I know it now--but him you do love--unworthy though he is----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is a lie!\" Captain Burton cried, starting up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hush, Harold! Is it worth while arguing about? Let him go on. Well, Mr. van Zwieten, you have come to tell us this. What else?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have come to offer you my assistance to escape.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! That is what I hardly expected to hear you say. And you must pardon me if I don\u0027t believe you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As you please,\" he said again. \"But you can escape to-night if you will. The men here now I shall take away with me shortly. Two horses will be left behind--food is in the house; and here are a couple of revolvers--one for you and one for Burton.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They took the weapons in silence. Could this be Van Zwieten? They did not know him in this new r?le of self-abnegation, and the suspicions of both husband and wife were thoroughly aroused. But the revolvers were good ones, and they were loaded. Could it be that he spoke truly and that he was anxious now to retrieve his past, to give up his plotting and spying and to live a virtuous life amongst the too-moral Boers, who had indeed, perhaps, forced him to do this thing? \\n\\n \\n\\n Still Brenda looked doubtfully at him, for compulsory righteousness was somewhat hard to credit. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see you don\u0027t believe me,\" he said, after a pause. \"Well, perhaps you are right. It is rather late in the day for me to turn saint. But you may be sure I should not do this unless I had some very strong inducement. If you are taken to Pretoria you will only remain to vex my eyes, and I want to get you out of sight. That is my reason for giving you your freedom. To-night I will send a messenger who will guide you to the British outposts. They are not so far off as you think. Buller has advanced almost to Spion Kop, and he has taken several of our positions. If he gets Spion Kop--and I understand Warren intends to capture it if he can--he will have the key to our position and will march on to Ladysmith. But\"--he shrugged his shoulders--\"there is many a slip, you know. Well, I will go in and get my men. Will you follow my messenger?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t say yet,\" Captain Burton said bluntly. \"You speak fair enough, but this may be a trick for all I know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How should I benefit by a trick?\" Van Zwieten asked. \"If I wanted to kill you I could do it now, and no one would be the wiser. The Boers here would shoot you with pleasure. But if I killed you and took Mrs. Burton, why, then, good-bye to my chance of becoming President of the Confederate States of South Africa. No, I will let you go; it suits me better. Love, as I said, must yield to ambition. But if you do not believe me, stay here. My messenger shall come at eight o\u0027clock to-night. Follow him or not as you please. Good-bye, Mrs. Burton. You little know what it is to me to give you up; but you must say I afford you every chance of being happy with your husband.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Brenda looked at him. She began to think he was acting in good faith after all. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am not ungrateful,\" she said gently. \"We will follow your messenger. Good-bye,\" and she held out her hand to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Van Zwieten bent over it and kissed it. Then he drew himself up, looked at Harold steadfastly and turned away in silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you believe in him?\" asked Brenda after a pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Upon my soul, I don\u0027t know. He is such a scoundrel. I wonder you could let him kiss your hand, Brenda!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Craft must be met by craft,\" she replied in a whisper. \"You silly boy, you don\u0027t mean to say you are jealous of that? Can\u0027t you see that I wanted to disarm his suspicions so that we might get away safely?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you don\u0027t believe in him? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; he has some scheme in his head. Hush, it\u0027s not safe to talk about it now--when he\u0027s gone. Meanwhile, let him think we accept his offer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It would really seem as though Van Zwieten were acting straightforwardly for the first time in his life. The Boers who had been guarding the place got their rifles, saddled the horses, and, headed by Van Zwieten, took themselves off down the mountain-side, and were shortly afterward to be seen riding across the veldt in a northerly direction. Captain Burton, still suspicious, could not believe in his good fortune. With Brenda he proceeded to explore the house. It was empty. They searched the orchard, the sheep kraals, the Kaffir huts--in fact, the whole domain, but they could find no trace of a single soul. No weapons had been left, but they had the revolvers. In the stable were two horses already saddled. Harold pointed this out to his wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ready, you see, for the journey!\" said he. \"Van Zwieten is evidently very sure that we shall accept his offer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, we\u0027ll not disappoint him so far as the horses are concerned,\" replied Brenda; \"but as to waiting for his messenger, I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll do that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Brenda, what do you mean? We don\u0027t know an inch of the country.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Probably this messenger of Van Zwieten\u0027s will know it rather too well for our liking. I don\u0027t trust the arrangement in the least. Believe me, dear, he will only lead us into some trap and we shall be prisoners again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see that Van Zwieten need have given himself the trouble to do that--we were his prisoners already.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t see through it at present either. But, nevertheless, I\u0027m sure there\u0027s something at the back of his ostensible generosity.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Captain Burton was at a loss how to interpret it. On the whole, he was inclined to trust to his wife\u0027s instinct. He had no sort of premise on which to argue against it. \\n\\n \\n\\n So they had something to eat and decided to leave at sundown. Beyond the hills they knew the British were engaging the enemy, so if they made due west they had every hope of coming up with the outposts of the advancing column. There was, of course, always the chance that they might not get even so far safely, but that they preferred to risk rather than trust in Mr. van Zwieten. \\n\\n \\n\\n Their horses were wiry little animals enough, and, if put to it, could show a very pretty pace. They fed and watered them now preparatory to their start. On the whole they were sanguine. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then came a surprise. As they were making their own meal they heard from outside a voice hailing them in English. Harold rushed to the door and returned shortly with Piet Bok. The old man looked anxious, and hurried forward to shake Brenda by the hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank the dear Lord you are safe,\" he said with emotion. \"I feared it might be otherwise--that you had fallen into that man\u0027s snare.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then it was a snare!\" cried Brenda, at this confirmation of her own feelings. \"Tell us, Mynheer Bok, what was his plan?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ach! is it not to tell it you and save you from it I am here?\" He rubbed his hands. \"I will show Van Zwieten that others can be slim as he. Beloved Lord, he is the seed of Satan, that man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He took away the guards, but he has left us the two revolvers and a couple of mounts all ready saddled.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quite so; and he is to send a messenger soon, is he not, to lead you to the British camp?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Believe him not. That messenger will not lead you to your camp, but to an ambuscade of Boers headed by Van Zwieten himself. Then your husband here will be shot and you will be carried off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The scoundrel! The double-dyed villain! But why all this, mynheer? We were in his power already.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, you were not. You must understand that I have power with the burghers; yes, and I told them your story, and they were amazed at the wickedness of this man, and he was told to go out from amongst us lest the dear Lord should send evil on the host. Then he said he would desist from his wicked schemes and send you on to Pretoria to be dealt with by the President. But I overheard his conversation with the messenger whom he intends to send to you, and I know his plan. You are to be carried off, as I have told you, and in durance vile kept until the war is over. Your husband will be shot, probably by Van Zwieten himself. But of all this he will say not a word to the burghers, and thus he will maintain his place amongst them. You see why he does not act openly? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see,\" said Brenda, her color rising. \"Now what are we to do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come with me at once,\" said Piet Bok. \"I will lead you by another route to your outposts, and so shall we thwart this son of the pit. But you must come at once, there is not a moment to lose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But the messenger?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course we do not wait for him. It would mean death to you or to him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Right you are, then; let\u0027s get off straight away. It\u0027s getting dark already.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ach, yes! that is well. Come along, then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Their trust in the old man was implicit. He had always proved a friend hitherto. The sun was setting in floods of gold over the mountain-tops as they rode down the path which descended to the veldt. Heavy rains had rendered the ground sodden. Piet Bok headed for a point in the hills where he said there was a pass other than the one in which Van Zwieten was waiting. Unluckily, as they started across the veldt, they saw a horseman coming toward them at full speed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The messenger!\" cried Brenda. \"What are we to do now, mynheer?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The old man unslung his gun. \"Kill him,\" he said quietly, \"else he will ride on and tell Van Zwieten. If he sees me with you he will guess the truth. It is well known in laager that I am the enemy of Van Zwieten.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Must he really be killed?\" asked Brenda, with a shudder. It was terrible to her that this man should be shot in cold blood. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is his life or mine, dear,\" said her husband, pulling out his revolver to be ready if Piet Bok should fail. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the approaching Boer was not going to trust himself at close quarters. He circled round them and held out a white flag in token of friendship. Harold laughed grimly as he recognized the old trick. Piet Bok sighted, and fired. But the fellow flung himself flat down on his horse\u0027s neck and the shot missed him. \\n\\n \\n\\n He rode off with a defiant whoop. A big Dutch oath escaped from the lips of Piet Bok, and he caught Brenda\u0027s horse by the bridle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must ride for it,\" he said. \"The man recognized me, and you too. He will hasten back to Van Zwieten, and they will be after us in no time. We must make for the hills.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can I thank you, Bok?\" said Harold, gratefully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Almighty, that is right! you spared my boy Hans.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time the messenger was a mere speck on the horizon. He was riding like the wind to take this news to his chief. \\n\\n \\n\\n The three fugitives made a straight line for the pass, urging their horses to their best. The sun had dropped behind the mountains and the shadows were gathering fast on the veldt. For several hours they tore on until they reached the mouth of the pass. There they pulled up to give themselves and their animals breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think we can count ourselves safe now,\" said Piet Bok, wiping his brow. \"But we must push on through the pass. At the other side let us hope we shall come up with your men.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The track was narrow and winding and full of mud, which fouled the horses and made the climbing doubly hard. It was quite dark there, but Piet knew every inch of the path, and rode on ahead fearless and confident. In about an hour they emerged. There were the lights of the British camp twinkling a mile and a half away. \\n\\n \\n\\n As they commenced the descent they heard a shot ring out, and Brenda gave a cry of dismay. Piet Bok had fallen from his saddle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ride, ride for your lives!\" cried the old man. \"He has come round by the other pass.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so it was. Van Zwieten, instead of following at their rear, had pushed through the other pass and had cut them off. But he had made one mistake. He had allowed them to get out of the pass on to the higher ground instead of cutting them off from the camp. As shot followed shot, Harold caught Brenda\u0027s horse by the bridle. Headlong they tore down toward the plain. \\n\\n \\n\\n The light, or rather the dark, was all against the pursuers. They gave up firing and made to overtake them. But the sound of the muskets had already been heard in the camp, and they could hear the bugles ringing out. Whether the brave old Boer who had saved them was dead or not they did not know. It was beyond their power to aid him. They urged their horses on and on, for in their speed lay the only hope of escape. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Courage, Brenda!\" cried Harold. \"Stick to it; they\u0027ve heard the firing in camp.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will, dear--I will.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then her husband looked round, and an exclamation of mingled relief and triumph came from him. They had given up the chase. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ve had enough of it, hurrah!\" he cried. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were now within a short distance of the camp, and could hear the commands being given consequent on what evidently had been taken for the commencement of a surprise on the part of the Boers. Those behind them had turned and fled now in the opposite direction--all of them save Van Zwieten. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stood up and fired twice. But his shot fell wide. Then Harold turned and tried what his revolver would do at that range. Van Zwieten\u0027s arm fell useless. Then he galloped off, none too soon, for a squadron of mounted infantry came on the scene just at the moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s all this?\" shouted the captain in command. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We have escaped!\" shouted Harold--\"Burton and Mrs. Burton.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What, is it you, old man?\" cried a friendly voice--a voice they knew well. \\n\\n \\n\\n For the fourth time Brenda had escaped her enemy. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1929/55411.html","bookId":880,"book":{"id":880,"title":"A Traitor in London","description":"简介： It\u0027s an infernal shame!I call it common sense!Call it what you please, Malet.
