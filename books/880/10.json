{"id":34660,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. THE MASS MEETING.","content":"The better day, the better deed. Acting on the advice of this proverb, those responsible for the pro-Boer meeting convened it on a Sunday, that all those engaged on other days in earning their bread might attend. And so far as numbers went, the crowded state of Trafalgar Square seemed to justify this course. Nelson\u0027s Column soared from a dense mass of people, which even overflowed into the streets approaching the great open space. On all sides the windows were filled with curious spectators, who, apprehensive all the while of trouble, gazed forth expectantly over the sea of heads below. But they need have had no fear. The mob was on its best behavior--good-natured and roughly jocular as an English crowd ever is--amenable to law and order, and ever ready to be controlled by the police. Platforms for the convenience of the orators had been erected round the grand column--the symbol of an Empire which these well-meaning busybodies were so anxious to dismember and destroy. Below, crowded laborers, artisans, shopkeepers, traders of all kinds; and on the fringe of the mob, hard by the National Gallery, were lines of hansom cabs, surmounted by clubmen from Pall Mall and St. James\u0027 Street who had come to see the fun. There were plenty of women, bringing with them their children, when they could not leave them at home, and a sprinkling of redcoats and bluejackets. These, as the visible symbol of England\u0027s fighting power, were idolized by the mob. For, alas for Mr. Scarse and his supporters, the voice of the people was dead against their philanthropic efforts. Instead of the Boer National Anthem, \"God Save the Queen\" and \"Rule Britannia\" were being sung. The Little Englanders were doing their best to laud Kruger and damn their own Government; but the temper of the mob was all the other way. In a word, the Imperialists were in the majority. On the parapet, near the National Gallery, Brenda, very plainly dressed, was holding on to Wilfred\u0027s arm. He had been lunching at Mrs. St. Leger\u0027s, and afterward Brenda had persuaded him to escort her to the meeting. She feared for the safety of her father, and dreaded lest his speech should draw on him the anger of the mob. The colonel had declined to come, swearing in true military style that he would attend no meeting meant to belittle England. \"Is Mr. van Zwieten here?\" asked Brenda, looking over the sea of heads. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" replied Wilfred, whose pale face was flushed with excitement. \"He is too clever to sympathize openly with the cause he advocates. No! his task is to condemn the Boers in public and to support them in private.\" \"Have you found out anything about him, Wilfred?\" \"Yes. He lives ostensibly in Duke Street, St. James; but he has other rooms in Westminster, where he passes under another name. There he receives all kinds of queer people--especially at night. \"Spies?\" asked Brenda, so low as not to be heard by those near her. \"I believe so. He calls himself Jones, and a good many spies go up to see Mr. Jones. The scoundrel! To plot treason almost in the shadow of the Clock Tower! But I do not blame him so much as those who are betraying their country. After all, Van Zwieten is a foreigner, and naturally hates us; but there are Englishmen, Brenda--Englishmen born and bred--who are selling secrets for Transvaal gold. I\u0027d hang the lot if I could!\" \"Hush, Wilfred, don\u0027t speak so loud. Can you prove that Van Zwieten is a spy?\" \"Not yet; but I have a plan in my head to trap him.\" \"He will not be easily trapped.\" \"No; he is a cunning beast, but I\u0027ll get the better of him yet. When I tear his mask off he\u0027ll be forced to leave London. Hullo! there\u0027s your father!\" Brenda turned pale as that familiar lean figure appeared on the platform. He was saluted with a groan. Several union Jacks were waved defiantly in his face, and a few bars of \"God Save the Queen\" were sung with lusty strength. A small knot of people stood round him. Taking off his hat, he advanced to the edge of the platform. A few expressions, such as \"God-fearing farmers,\" \"greedy capitalists,\" \"the Jingoism of Chamberlain,\" \"the treachery of Rhodes,\" caught Brenda\u0027s ear, and then her father\u0027s voice was drowned in a roar of cheering and singing. In vain did Mr. Scarse hold up his hand for silence; in reply he was assailed with insults, and a lifeguardsman was shouldered and passed along the heads of the crowd, a red spot of color amid the neutral tints. union Jacks were waved, \"Rule Britannia\" was sung. Many a groan was there for Kruger; many a cheer for \"Joe\"; and the close-locked crowd, maddened by the sound of its own voice, rolled and swung like a stormy sea. \"Pore thing! pore thing!\" said an old woman near Brenda, \"I \u0027ope they won\u0027t chuck him into the fountings.\" \"Oh, Wilfred!\" gasped the girl, terrified for her father\u0027s safety. But the suggestion met with the approval of the crowd, and passed from mouth to mouth until it reached those immediately under the fountain. A roar went up to the sky, and several enthusiasts endeavored to clamber up the platform. The police beat them back, and order was restored for the moment. Then, as an appeal to the chivalry of the mob, a grim-looking female with a black bag came forward to speak. She commenced a highly abusive harangue, but it was drowned in laughter and a recommendation, in terms purely colloquial, that she should go home and tend any young offspring she might chance to have. The pro-Boers began to look disconsolate. Each effort they made to speak was abortive. A sailor jumped on the parapet opposite Morley\u0027s Hotel and waved a union Jack. The mob saw and cheered, and roared out the National Anthem. Some threw apples and oranges at the orators on the platform, who promptly dodged behind the Column and endeavored to obtain a hearing on the other side, but with even less success. On losing sight of her father, Brenda wanted to try and follow him; and Wilfred, the patriot, although he hated Scarse, and would gladly have seen him ducked, could not but sympathize with the girl\u0027s anxiety. So, extricating themselves from the crowd, they struggled downward toward the lower part of the square. There a knot of talkers attracted their attention. \"Wot I say is, Why does Rhodes want to fight a lot of \u0027ard-working coves like them Boers?\" said one begrimed ruffian. \"They\u0027re the same as us, ain\u0027t they?\" \"No, they ain\u0027t,\" grunted his neighbor. \"They won\u0027t give Englishmen votes, an\u0027 we made their bloomin\u0027 country, we did.\" \"I \u0027old by Gladstone, I tell you----\" \"Garn! you and your Gladstone; he\u0027d ha\u0027 given away Windsor Castle if he cud.\" \"Ho! Wot price Majuba!\" \"Ah! we must wipe out that disgrace,\" said a clearer and apparently more highly-educated speaker. Then the fun began. Some abused Gladstone as the cause of all the trouble, others made extensive demands upon their vocabulary for a due definition of Mr. Chamberlain. It speedily became apparent that none of them knew what they were talking about. Wilfred laughed, and the begrimed one straightway resented his laughter. \"We don\u0027t want no tall \u0027ats \u0027ere,\" he yelped. \"No, you want sense,\" retorted Burton. But, unwilling to involve Brenda in a row, he pushed on. As they passed away they heard a scuffle, and looked back to see that the dirty man had at last his heart\u0027s desire, so far as to have found an antagonist. But even thus early in the game he was getting the worst of it. At length, having apparently had enough, he gave forth a lusty yell for \"police,\" and was duly rescued in a battered condition, and still arguing. Brenda felt anxious. The mob all round was showing signs of restiveness. In another part of the square some pro-Boer orators spoke with more chance of a hearing. They drew the usual picture of a small toiling community, of unscrupulous capitalists, the worship of gold, the rights of the Boers to arrange affairs in their own house, and the iniquity of a mighty Empire crushing a diminutive State, wholly unable to defend itself. Furious at the falsehoods which he heard all around him, Wilfred lost his head altogether, and, despite all Brenda\u0027s entreaty, got up on the parapet and raised his voice. \"Lies, lies! all lies, I say. All that we demand are equal rights for the white man and kindly treatment of the black. The Boer is a brutal bully. He beats the black man, and treats him like a dog. Kruger and his gang have accumulated millions through the industry of those to whom they refuse the franchise. It is they who want war, not England; and if we refuse their challenge, then will they try to drive us out of Africa. It is not the Transvaal Republic which is in danger, but the Empire. Continental Powers, who hate us, are urging these misguided people to do what they dare not do themselves, hoping to profit took place. At length the police, as in the former by their folly and attack us when we are hampered in South Africa. Don\u0027t believe these liars, men! They betray their own country, and a good half of them are paid with Transvaal gold for doing so. Spies! Traitors, all of them. Duck them here in the fountains.\" Then, having thus relieved his feelings, Wilfred took the girl\u0027s hand and pushed on hurriedly; and soon they were lost to view in the crowd. But the effect of his words was immediate. The pro-Boer champions, trying to make good their cause, were not allowed speech. As quickly as they opened their mouths the mob shouted them down. Some ugly rushes were made in their direction, and they were hustled roughly. A couple of men and women, beginning to see they were in danger of being chucked, shouted for the police of the very Government they had been abusing. A body of constables forced itself through the crowd and formed a cordon round these political martyrs. They were escorted to the fringe of the mob, looking pale and nervous--anything, in fact, but heroic. And the language with which they were saluted was not such as need be set down here. Meanwhile their friends at the Column were faring badly enough. The police began to see that the temper of the mob was rising, and insisted that the speaking--or rather the attempts to speak--should stop. The orators refused, and stuck to their platform they were driven off from one side and they climbed up the other. Missiles began to fly, the crowd to growl, and some rough-and-tumble fights took place. At length the police, as in the former case, marched them away down Northumberland Avenue. The crowd which followed was so excited that the martyrs, afraid of the storm which, by their own folly, they had raised, tried to enter one of the hotels. But the porters here were prepared, and drove them back, and the wretched creatures--Scarse amongst them--were beaten to and fro like tennis balls. Finally, they managed to gain the shelter of a clubhouse, where they held an indignation meeting on their own account. But nothing on earth and above it would have convinced them that they had got just what they deserved. Brenda was in a great state of alarm for her father. But Wilfred consoled her as well as he could. \"He will be all right,\" he said cheerfully; \"the police will look after him.\" \"He may be hurt.\" \"He should have thought of that before he played the fool. But he will not be hurt; those sort of people never are. I beg your pardon, Brenda. After all, he is your father.\" \"He honestly believes in the Boers, Wilfred.\" \"I know he does. He\u0027d find out his mistake if he went to live amongst them. I wish I could have had half an hour at them, Brenda,\" he said, with sparkling eyes. \"I would have done but for you.\" \"You said quite enough, Wilfred. I was afraid the police would arrest you.\" \"Arrest me! Come, that\u0027s good, seeing I spoke for the Government. What about your father and his wretched friends who are abusing their own country?\" \"There are two sides to every question.\" \"Not to this one,\" replied Wilfred, who was easily excited on the subject. Brenda decided that it was best not to contradict him. He was so highly strung that in moments of this kind he was not altogether accountable either for his speech or actions. He would flash into a rage on the slightest provocation, and contradict every one around him, like some hysterical woman. No doctor could call him insane, since he knew well how to conduct himself, and was not the prey of any hallucination. But his brain was delicately balanced, and worry or persistent irritation brought him very near the borders of insanity. For this reason he led a quiet life, and saw but few people. The magnitude and whirl of London always overwrought him, and Brenda regretted now that she had argued with him at all. \"Have it your own way, Wilfred,\" she said, taking his arm. \"But I hope my father is safe. I have seen enough, so you might take me home.\" \"All right. Don\u0027t be angry with me, Brenda. But the silly views your father takes annoy me.\" \"I am not angry with you, Wilfred. Come along; let\u0027s get back now.\" \"About time too,\" said he. \"The whole thing\u0027s a farce.\" \"Ah! I agree with you there, Mr. Burton,\" said a voice, and Brenda turned with a start to find Van Zwieten at her elbow. \"How are you, Miss Scarse?\" he asked quietly, as though nothing unusual had passed between them at their last meeting. \"And what do you think of this silly business?\" \"I think it just what you call it--silly,\" replied Brenda, coldly. \"But I did not expect to hear you say so.\" \"You ought to be pleased that your friends are fighting your battles,\" said Wilfred. Van Zwieten flicked a grain of dust from off his frock coat and raised his eyebrows. \"My friends!\" he repeated. \"Oh, none of those who spoke are my friends, unless you refer to Mr. Scarse. But of course I don\u0027t agree with his views. I am an Imperialist,\" he said smoothly. Remembering the disclosures he had made to her, Brenda was astounded at the effrontery of the man; but Wilfred understood. \"Of course you are an Imperialist,\" he said; \"it pays better!\" \"Quite so,\" assented Van Zwieten \"it pays better--much better. But you talk in riddles.\" \"Do I? I think you can guess them then,\" retorted Wilfred, \"and I don\u0027t think you will find Oom Paul will benefit by this meeting. It will show him how very much of one mind the English people are, and how they are determined to teach him a lesson.\" \"Oh, a lesson, eh?\" Van Zwieten laughed. \"It is to be hoped Oom Paul will prove an apt pupil; but I fear he is too old to learn.\" \"And Leyds--is he too old? He pulls the strings!\" \"What strings?\" asked the Dutchman, blankly. \"The strings to make you dance!\" In spite of Van Zwieten\u0027s command of his temper, Wilfred was making him angry. This of itself Brenda did not mind in the least; but she did mind a quarrel, and toward that she could see these two were fast drifting. Moreover, owing to the raised tones of Wilfred\u0027s voice, a crowd was collecting. Mr. van Zwieten did not look altogether comfortable. He despised Wilfred as a mere boy; but even so, boy or not, this young fellow, with his fearless nature and frantic patriotism, might put highly undesirable notions into the heads of those around. And most of them were more or less inflammable just then. The fountains, too, were close at hand. \"Come along, Wilfred,\" said Brenda. \"Do let us get home.\" But before he could reply, a hubbub arose amid the crowd not far distant, and they turned in that direction. From out the jeers and laughter an angry voice could be heard holding forth in abuse of the Government and in praise of the Boers. Then the crowd parted, surged along, and Brenda saw advancing a tall, thin man. He wore a snuff-colored coat, and a yard or so of crape wrapped round his throat like a scarf. And his face--how like it was to that of her father! \"Oh!\" she cried, grasping Wilfred\u0027s arm, \"that is the man who----\" \"Hush!\" Van Zwieten whispered fiercely. \"Don\u0027t accuse him in public!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1929/55395.html","bookId":880,"book":{"id":880,"title":"A Traitor in London","description":"简介： It\u0027s an infernal shame!I call it common sense!Call it what you please, Malet.
