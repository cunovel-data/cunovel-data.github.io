{"id":34677,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. NEMESIS.","content":"Having no ambition toward enacting the r?le of heroine of an Adelphi melodrama, Brenda was beginning to weary of this game of hide-and-seek. However, she was safe for the time being, as even the redoubtable Van Zwieten could hardly be expected to take her from the midst of the British army. Harold reported the mishap which had led to the loss of his men, and afterward rejoined his company. He wished his wife to go back to Spearman\u0027s Camp; but she begged so hard to remain that at last he consented. Permission was obtained from the authorities, and Brenda betook herself to her old task of nursing the wounded. She related to her friend the doctor as much of her adventures as she could without trenching too closely on her private affairs; and great surprise was expressed at her perils and her lucky escape. But to Wilfred, who came to see her and his brother as soon as he heard of their rescue, she related everything in detail. \n \n \"By Jove! what a scoundrel that fellow is!\" said that young man. \"I wonder when he intends to leave you alone.\" \n \n \"Never, I fear,\" replied Brenda. \"Unless he is killed I shall never be safe from him.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll shoot him myself if I get a chance. He is a danger to society--it must be some one\u0027s business to put him out of the way. You have had a bad time, Brenda; but I don\u0027t think you need fear the man any more.\" \n \n \"What makes you say that?\" \n \n \"I have an idea that he has come to the end of his tether.\" \n \n \"So have I,\" she said. \"And I told him so. But, Wilfred, tell me about my father?\" \n \n \"He has gone back to Durban, as you know, to see the authorities about your disappearance. He thinks you have been taken prisoner by the Boers, and that you are at Pretoria by now. He is going to try and get you exchanged.\" \n \n \"There is no need for that, thank God!\" said Brenda, cheerfully. \"I must let him know at once.\" \n \n \"That will be difficult unless you send a message from Ladysmith.\" \n \n \"When do you think we shall be there?\" \n \n \"If the luck holds good, in a couple of days. We have taken most of the Boer positions; now Warren intends to try for Spion Kop to-night. If he captures it, we shall hold the key to the Boer position.\" \n \n \"Ah, you see Wilfred, your forebodings are all wrong.\" \n \n \"We are yet in the wood, not out of it,\" replied he, significantly. \"However, I will give Buller and Warren all praise. They have done well. All the same, I still condemn this plan of campaign. Only a miracle can render it successful.\" \n \n \"Well, we shall see what happens when Spion Kop is taken. Do try and look on the bright side of things, Wilfred.\" \n \n But the young man departed, still shaking his head. There was no doubt that he was very depressing company. His face wore a look of settled gloom most painful to behold; and he was always prognosticating calamity in the face of the most promising operations. At the same time he invariably refrained from pessimism in his letters to his newspaper, which were usually cheerful and full of devoted praise of the behavior of both troops and officers. \n \n It was anxious work waiting in the hospital while Harold was in the field. But Brenda had not much time for thought. She was nursing the wounded with all her heart and soul, and was an angel of light amongst the weary, wounded soldiers. The doctor called her his right hand, as well he might. She deprived herself of rest and food to be by her patients. Only when compelled to, did she lie down; and then it was in her clothes, ready to be up and doing at the call of duty. Her best qualities came out in this most arduous work. \n \n The grand attack on Spion Kop was to be made at night, in order to effect a surprise. All day long the operations went on in the field. Toward sunset Harold\u0027s company had to dislodge a number of Boers who had entrenched themselves on the slope of the mountain. The position was taken and the enemy fell back; but not without considerable loss of life on both sides. Amongst the wounded was Harold, who was shot through the lung. It was dark when the news was brought into the camp, and the ambulance bearers started under a rising moon for this miniature battlefield. \n \n Quite unaware of her husband\u0027s mishap, Brenda was busy attending a dying man. But he was beyond her aid, and died within a very short time of his being brought in. She was closing his eyes with a sigh at the horrors of war when one of the doctors told her that she was wanted. With a presentiment of bad news she went out and found Wilfred waiting to speak to her. He was greatly agitated and took her hand as if to give her courage. \n \n \"Brenda, I have bad news for you!\" \n \n \"It is Harold!\" she cried, pale to the lips. \n \n \"Yes, it is Harold. I have only just heard.\" \n \n \"He is dead?\" \n \n \"No. I hope not--I don\u0027t know but he fell while leading the attack on one of the small kopjes. They are just going out to bring in the wounded. I thought----\" \n \n \"Yes, I\u0027ll come,\" said Brenda, anticipating his speech. \"Is it far?\" \n \n \"No, not very. Make haste. God grant we may find him alive!\" \n \n She needed no second bidding, but hastily gathered together some medical comforts, wrapped herself in a cloak and came out. In silence they walked toward the fatal spot which had been pointed out to Wilfred by a private who had seen Harold fall. She did not weep. Her emotion was too deep for tears. The moment which she had been dreading all these months had arrived--unexpectedly, as all such moments do. Now she felt that the actual event was not so terrible as the expectation had been. There was a chance that he might be alive. He was wiry, healthy, clean-blooded and clean living, and the Mauser bullets, as Brenda had seen, inflicted a clean wound. Full of silent prayer she walked on. Had she heard of this in England she would have been distracted; but somehow, since she was on the spot and would soon be with him, it did not seem quite so terrible. At all events he had fallen in the forefront of battle, doing his work, and not by the treachery of Van Zwieten. If he died he could not die more gloriously. There was comfort in that thought. \n \n \"I saw Van Zwieten to-day,\" said Wilfred, suddenly. \n \n \"You did? Where? When?\" asked Brenda, wondering if after all the scoundrel could have had anything to do with this mishap to her husband. \n \n \"On the lower slopes. I was looking through my field-glass and saw him quite plainly riding about on a big black horse. I recognized him by his long golden beard. I am certain it was he; that was why I wanted you to come with me to see after Harold.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t understand----\" \n \n \"Because as Van Zwieten is about the place he is bound to hear that Harold has been shot. He has spies everywhere; and from one of our prisoners I heard that he had described Harold\u0027s appearance to several Boer sharp-shooters, that the poor chap might be picked off.\" \n \n \"Do you know the prisoner\u0027s name?\" \n \n \"Yes; and he\u0027s a fine old fellow who did good service to you--Piet Bok!\" \n \n \"Then he was not killed at the time we escaped?\" \n \n \"No, only touched on the right arm. He was taken prisoner this morning. I would have come and told you, but I couldn\u0027t get away. I saw him by chance, and he recognized me from my resemblance to Harold. I told him he was wrong and then he informed me of Van Zwieten\u0027s new villainy. By this time the man who picked off Harold has, no doubt, told Van Zwieten, and has received his reward. And that scoundrel will probably come down to see if the news is true.\" \n \n \"What?\" shrieked Brenda. \"Oh, don\u0027t, Wilfred! If he finds Harold still alive he will kill him.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s what I thought; and that\u0027s why I got you to come with me. I feel certain that the brute will be there.\" \n \n She uttered a cry of mingled terror and pain. \"Oh, Wilfred, do not let us lose a moment. Harold, my darling!\" She began to run. \n \n \"Come, Brenda, keep as quiet as you can. You\u0027ll need all your strength!\" \n \n A glorious moon filled the world with its pale radiance. The shadows of the mountains and kopjes were black as Indian ink in the white light. Here and there were points of fire, and in the distance a glimpse of the white tents of the camp. To the right rose the great mass of Spion Kop, with its flat table top dark and menacing. But a few hours and there would be a deadly struggle on that pinnacle. Already the generals were maturing their plans for the assault. Occasionally the boom of a gun could be heard, for the Boers had not yet desisted from firing, in spite of the lateness of the hour. Brenda paid no heed to all this. She strained her eyes toward the rising ground they were approaching. Was he dead or alive? All her life was bound up in the answer to that question. \n \n The Indian bearers swung along at a slow trot, and she followed closely on Wilfred\u0027s arm. He felt her shiver although the night was warm, and did his best to console her. And she never forgot his brotherly kindness at that terrible hour. \n \n They climbed up the slope which earlier in the day had been swept by rifle fire. Now the Boers had retreated to another point of vantage, and the position was held by a small force of our men. As the ambulance party approached it was challenged and the word was given. In a few minutes the bearers were within the entrenchments. \n \n \"Glad you\u0027ve come,\" said the officer in charge; \"there are many poor fellows here who require your attention. The enemy are removing their dead now.\" \n \n He addressed these remarks to the doctor, but he saluted when he saw Brenda, whom he knew. \"I expected you, Mrs. Burton. Your husband is over yonder. We have made him as comfortable as possible.\" \n \n \"Then he is not dead?\" gasped Brenda, turning faint. \n \n \"Oh, no,\" he said cheerily, \"he is worth a dozen dead men. You\u0027ll soon pull him round. Over there.\" \n \n He pointed to the left and she hurried away. Wilfred lingered behind to speak to the officer. \"Have you noticed a particularly tall man with the Boers?\" he asked, \"a man with a golden beard?\" \n \n \"Yes. He asked after Burton. It seems he was a friend of his before the war.\" \n \n \"Has he seen him?\" asked Wilfred, turning pale, for well he knew the reason of Van Zwieten\u0027s inquiries. \n \n \"No, I think not. But he intends to look him up shortly. I think your brother will pull through, Burton,\" and he hurried away to attend to his duties. Wilfred stood still and meditated. He grasped his revolver. \"The man has lived too long,\" he murmured; \"I must do it!\" \n \n Then he moved toward the group round his brother. Brenda was supporting his head, and a doctor was examining the wound in the poor fellow\u0027s chest. \"We must wait till we get him to the hospital,\" he said. \"Have him put into the ambulance, Mrs. Burton.\" \n \n \"Has he a chance, doctor?\" she asked with quivering lips. \n \n \"I can\u0027t say yet. The bullet has pierced the lung. Hope for the best.\" \n \n Then he hurried away with his attendants, and Brenda was left alone with her husband and Wilfred. Harold was quite unconscious, but breathing faintly, and as she bent over him, with an agonized face, she prayed that God would spare his life. Wilfred stood beside her and looked down silently on that countenance waxen in the light of the lantern. As he stood there, as Brenda placed Harold\u0027s head on her knees, both heard a mocking voice beside them. \n \n \"Well, Mrs. Burton, you are a widow at last!\" \n \n She gave a cry of horror at the ill-omened words, and Wilfred turned with a bound to clutch Van Zwieten by the throat. \n \n \"You hound!\" he cried. \"You miserable dog!\" and he hurled the big man to the ground. \n \n Taken by surprise, the Dutchman had fallen; but he rose to his feet with an ugly scowl, cursing bitterly. \"I\u0027ll pay you out for this!\" he said menacingly. \"At present my business is with Mrs. Burton.\" \n \n \"I refuse to speak to you,\" cried she. \"You are a wicked man, and God will punish you.\" \n \n \"I rather think that it is you who have been punished,\" he sneered. \"Your husband is dead, or pretty near it. Now it is my turn.\" \n \n \"He is not dead. He will live when you are lying in your grave. Leave me; you have done harm enough!\" \n \n \"But he has not paid for it!\" cried Wilfred, savagely. \n \n \"No, nor will he pay!\" cried Van Zwieten, defiantly. \n \n Wilfred pulled out his revolver. \"I will make you pay!\" he said. \"You shall fight me!\" \n \n The Dutchman was no coward, but he drew back from the terrible expression on the young man\u0027s face, accentuated as it was in the strong moonlight. \n \n \"I refuse to fight with you,\" he said sullenly. \"This matter has nothing to do with you. If I choose to marry your brother\u0027s widow, that is my business. Mind your own!\" \n \n \"You shall marry no one,\" said Wilfred, harshly, \"for I intend to kill you.\" \n \n Brenda did not speak. She listened absently while the two men wrangled. Van Zwieten looked at her for a moment, then he turned his back on Wilfred. \n \n \"I will not fight you,\" he repeated. \n \n The other man sprang forward and struck him on the cheek with his fist. \"Will that make you fight?\" \n \n With a roar of rage Van Zwieten turned and flung himself forward. He caught the younger man in his arms like a child and threw him on the grass. Then he drew out his revolver and fired at the prostrate man. But Brenda had looked up, and seeing his intention had sprung to her feet and grasped his arm. The shot went wide, and in his rage Van Zwieten struck her--the woman he loved--struck her to the ground. And before he could recover himself sufficiently to fire a second time, he fell with a hoarse cry, shot twice through the breast by Wilfred Burton. \n \n \"Nemesis has come up with you at last,\" said the young man, picking up Brenda in his arms. \n \n The sound of the shots had attracted the attention of the men near at hand. \"Good God, Burton, what have you done?\" cried an officer. \n \n \"Killed some vermin,\" was the reply. \"Here, bring the ambulance along and put Burton into it.\" \n \n \"Wilfred!\" shrieked Brenda, who had recovered her breath, \"is he dead?\" \n \n \"No,\" said Van Zwieten, faintly, \"not dead--but dying--I have lost!\" \n \n No one attempted to molest Wilfred. \"I can explain myself to the commanding officer,\" he said. \"He will approve of what I have done.\" \n \n By this time the other Boers had taken their departure, or there might have been trouble at this violation of the armistice. Brenda aided the men to place Harold in the ambulance, and when she had made him comfortable, returned to the side of Wilfred, who was explaining his conduct to the officer in command. Van Zwieten heard her footstep--or he must have felt her presence near him. He opened his eyes. \"I am done for,\" he said. \"I suppose it is just, but I loved you, Brenda!\" \n \n Much as she hated him, she could not see him die there without making an effort to save him. She tried to staunch the wound, but it was impossible. The doctor had long since taken his departure. Seeing that all human aid was useless, she moistened the man\u0027s lips with brandy. \n \n \"Thank you,\" he said faintly. \"Will you forgive me?\" \n \n \"Yes, I forgive you,\" she whispered, \"but you must ask forgiveness of God.\" \n \n Van Zwieten shook his head feebly. \"It is too late for that. Ask Burton to forgive me. He has punished me. He can afford to be generous.\" \n \n Wilfred overheard the words. \"I forgive you the ill you have done my family, but I do not forgive you for seeking the hospitality of my country and betraying it. Come, Brenda!\" \n \n \"I can tell you something about that,\" said Van Zwieten, in a weak voice. \"Come near.\" \n \n Quite unsuspicious, Wilfred knelt down beside him. In an instant Van Zwieten raised his revolver and shot him through the throat. He fell back with the blood pouring from his mouth. \n \n Van Zwieten laughed. \"Quits!\" he said. Then he fell back dead. \n \n All was confusion. Brenda knelt beside her brother-in-law, and took his head in her lap, while the others crowded round Van Zwieten\u0027s dead body. Wilfred opened his eyes, saw Brenda\u0027s eyes bending over him, and whispered, \"Bend down, quick!\" \n \n She put her ear to his mouth, and heard him whisper in broken words, \"In my breast-pocket--look yourself--packet--confession. I shot Malet.\" \n \n \"You--oh!\" gasped Brenda. \"Why?\" \n \n Wilfred Burton raised himself up with one last expiring effort. \"For England!\" he cried. \"For England--God bless Eng----\" Then he too fell back a corpse. Brenda fainted. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1929/55412.html","bookId":880,"book":{"id":880,"title":"A Traitor in London","description":"简介： It\u0027s an infernal shame!I call it common sense!Call it what you please, Malet.
