{"id":34670,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. ON THE TRACK.","content":"Brenda Burton was a singularly obstinate young woman. Once she had decided upon a scheme she never rested until she had carried it through. And being thus minded toward the affairs of everyday life, how much more obstinate was she likely to be touching a matter concerning the safety of her husband. Leaving Mr. Scarse to make his arrangements--and he had much to do--she herself ascertained full particulars as to the route, and the cost of the journey. \n \n \"We can make for the Canary Islands to-morrow,\" she told her father. \"There is a Castle liner leaving in the afternoon. There we can pick up the German boat, Kaiser Fritz, which goes on to Delagoa Bay.\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t we go straight to the Cape in an English boat and get a steamer there to the bay?\" \n \n \"Oh, yes, but the other way will be quicker, I think. The day after we arrive at the Canaries we can pick up the German boat, and we sha\u0027n\u0027t have to transship at the Cape. I don\u0027t think we can do better.\" \n \n \"Well, as you please,\" said he. \"I should like to go in the Kaiser Fritz myself; it would afford me an excellent opportunity for learning the true opinions of the Germans about this--to my thinking--most unjust war.\" \n \n Brenda shrugged her shoulders. \"I dare say they will be disagreeable,\" she said. \"They are so jealous of us, and if our country went to the wall--which she never will do,\" interpolated she, patriotically--\"Germany would be in a very bad position. She would not be the overwhelming power she hopes to be with France and Russia at her heels. But don\u0027t let us talk politics. All I want is to make use of their boat to reach Delagoa Bay. Give me a check, father, and I will take the passages. To-morrow you must be ready to get as far as Southampton.\" \n \n So, like the quick-witted woman she was, she attended to all the business, and her father found, to his astonishment, that he had nothing to do but step on board the liner. Lady Jenny Malet came to see them off. She could do nothing against Van Zwieten at present; but there was no knowing what he might do at any moment, and they must be prepared to checkmate him. So she gave Mrs. Burton a registered address, in case she might have to communicate with her, and did her best to cheer her. \n \n \"I feel sure you will find him all right, dear,\" she said, as she kissed the girl. \"He is not the man to be shot by a scoundrel like Van Zwieten. And you can coax Kruger into doing what you want. You are pretty enough to do what you like with him.\" \n \n Brenda smiled faintly--the first smile for many day\u0027s. \"I don\u0027t think that will have much influence with a man like Kruger,\" she said. \n \n \"Nonsense, my dear. He is a man, and men are always susceptible. I\u0027m sure you have had enough experience of that,\" sighed Lady Jenny. \"All your troubles have arisen out of that horrid Van Zwieten being in love with you.\" \n \n Brenda was not much comforted by this view of the situation. She hoped rather to move Mr. Kruger by an appeal to his religious convictions, though these were of the stern cast of the Old Testament. However, it was in a very hopeful frame of mind that she went on board the liner, and she cabled to Wilfred at Spearman\u0027s Camp telling him that she was coming out. In the hope of making things as safe as possible for her husband, she cabled also to Van Zwieten. Surely, when he received that, he would do nothing at all events, until he had seen and come to terms with her. What those terms would be she could not guess. But she imagined they would include a suggestion that she should obtain a divorce from Harold. He was, as she well knew, quite as obstinate as his respected President--and with none of his morality or his religion. In fact, Brenda was going to Pretoria without any sort of definite idea save one--that somehow or other she would save her husband from this man. That was her sole object, and achieve it she would by hook or by crook; and she had every confidence in her own capacity to outwit the Dutchman, wily as he was. And the days of calm and peace on board the boat afforded her ample time for conjecture and reflection. She had grown now to hate this man with a hatred that would only be appeased by his destruction. \n \n They made a quick run to the islands, and the sea air did her the world of good. There were many passengers on board; but to no one of them did she in any way confide. Sad at heart, she kept very much to herself, and either read or indulged in her own thoughts. Her father was, socially speaking, anything but popular among his fellow-passengers. Air his Little England opinions he would, with the result that the majority of the passengers, having relatives at the front, gave him a wide berth. He made not a single convert; and all those whom he tried to argue round to his own way of thinking were glad enough when he got off at Madeira. \n \n The Kaiser Fritz came up to time and Brenda soon found herself on the way south. She did not much fancy the foreign boat--officers, crew and passengers being all pro-Boer to a man. They were polite enough to the English lady, but they took no trouble to disguise their real opinions. The captain expressed some surprise that she should be going to Delagoa Bay, and seemed inclined to suspect some political significance in her doing so, though it was difficult to see what grounds he could have had for such an absurd idea. And Mrs. Burton did not enlighten him, but left the matter to her father. Mr. Scarse intimated that his daughter was going to Pretoria to nurse her wounded husband, an explanation which seemed to appeal to the sentimental Germans. After that they were increasingly polite to her. But she preferred her own cabin. Her father was more companionable; but even he found but scant pleasure in their outspoken opinions on the subject of England, and her inevitable downfall, as they put it. Even he, with his Little England proclivities, felt his patriotism awake in the most alarming manner at the way these foreigners jeered and scoffed. Smarting under the insults, he developed quite a Jingo feeling, much to his daughter\u0027s amusement; and he ended by withdrawing himself as much as possible from the society of all on board. Father and daughter were a good deal together, and both looked forward eagerly to the end of a disagreeable voyage. \n \n One night, when they were south of the Line, they were on deck together. The heavens were bright with stars, and the great grey circle of the sea lay round them like a trackless desert. Most of those on board were down below, and the two had the deck to themselves. Brenda was disinclined for conversation. Her mind was, as usual, full of thoughts of her husband, and the only feeling she seemed cognizant of was one of joy in the thought that every day was bringing her nearer to him. Mr. Scarse broke the silence. \n \n \"Brenda,\" he said, \"did Lady Jenny say anything about that murder?\" \n \n \"Very little. She said that Van Zwieten had accused her of the crime, and that she was innocent. Of course I told her that I had never dreamed of such a thing, and never would have credited it for one moment.\" \n \n \"H\u0027m! At one time I thought myself that she might be guilty,\" he said. \"But I know now that I was wrong. That piece of crape certainly was suspicious. But poor Scarse told me that in his struggle with Malet the scarf had been torn. I never noticed it myself when I burned it. I suppose that Malet kept it in his hand without being aware of it.\" \n \n \"Very likely. At all events, I am sure Lady Jenny is innocent--as innocent as my uncle. He is happy, I hope?\" \n \n \"In the asylum? Yes, poor fellow, he is as happy as he can be anywhere. He has every comfort, and kind treatment. But I fear he will not live long. Van Zwieten gave him a fright by threatening to denounce him for the murder, unless he told his sad story. Some of it he did tell, but not all. I was foolish enough to relate the rest of it to Van Zwieten. But I had no alternative at the time. He was quite capable of making a scandal. Brenda, who did kill Malet? Every day the thing seems to become more obscure.\" \n \n \"Well, father, I can\u0027t help thinking it was Van Zwieten. Lady Jenny thinks so too.\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t say so? But the revolver--it was Harold\u0027s.\" \n \n \"Harold left them--that is, he left a case of two revolvers behind him, and both were in the library--in Mr. Malet\u0027s library on that night. Van Zwieten came to see him, and took one of them with him--at least, that is what Lady Jenny thinks.\" \n \n \"Brenda, that sounds improbable. Why should he kill Malet? He hardly knew him, child.\" \n \n \"Indeed, you are wrong there, father,\" she said, \"he knew him only too well. Listen!\" and she related the story the widow had told her concerning her husband\u0027s treachery toward his own country. Mr. Scarse was deeply indignant and indulged in language unusually strong for him. Little Englander though he was, and misguided on many points though he might be, he was an honest and an honorable man; and he could not understand how a man in Mr. Malet\u0027s position could have so deliberately played the part of traitor. When he was in possession of all the facts, he quite agreed with Brenda that Van Zwieten was the culprit. \n \n \"Then we\u0027ll bring him to book,\" he said angrily. \"I will force him to confess.\" \n \n \"That will do no good, father. The truth cannot come to light without the story of Mr. Malet\u0027s treachery being known; and Lady Jenny is more than anxious to avoid that. No, Van Zwieten must be left to the punishment of his own conscience.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think that will trouble him much,\" Mr. Scarse said grimly. \"How I have been deceived in that man! I am sure, when I tell Kruger his true character, he will have nothing to do with him.\" \n \n Brenda did not contradict this statement, although she felt pretty certain that the foxy old President was very little better himself. How her father could reconcile the opinion he held that Kruger was an honest, harmless old man with the fact that he had forced this terrible war upon England was more than she could understand. She wondered if, when her father got to Pretoria, his discovery of the true aims of the Transvaal Government would be at all modified. But of this she had her doubts. He was the most obstinate of men, and an angel from heaven could not have altered his opinion once it had been formed. Knowing this, she never argued with him. It was absolutely futile, and only caused trouble. \n \n At the Cape the vessel stopped for a time. Brenda did not go ashore. She felt too sad and heavy at heart to take any interest in the sight of new scenes and new people. She sat on the deck and looked at the smiling land, at the glitter of the water as it danced in the hot tropical sun. The azure of sky and sea, the transports, merchant ships, and men-of-war, the whiteness of the city set in groves of green, the whole lying under the shadow of Table Mountain, all went to form a picture unsurpassable in its peculiar beauty. It was her first sight of Africa. But it might be Harold\u0027s grave, and she hated it for its very beauty. She would have had all Nature mourn for her dear one. \n \n Mr. Scarse went on shore and returned with the latest war news. The tactics seemed to be mostly of a defensive order. General French had driven back a Boer force which had attacked Colesberg, and the gallant Ladysmith garrison had repelled a terrible assault. The Cape Town people were in high glee over this last success, anticipating, as they did, that the Boers would now be disheartened. And no doubt it might have had this effect for a time; but the Teutonic race is not so easily beaten or discouraged. Mr. Scarse remarked on this when they left for Delagoa Bay. \n \n \"The difficulty of this war,\" he said, \"is, that for the first time Teuton is fighting against Teuton. The very dogged courage which has enabled us to win so many battles against the Latin nations is being used against us by the Boers. We do not know when we are beaten either. But this will not be the easy task we thought, and the struggle will go on till one or other of the combatants is utterly crushed.\" \n \n \"Oh, England will win!\" Brenda said confidently. \n \n \"I believe she will. I can\u0027t imagine England being beaten. But, as I said before, it will be no easy task. By this time they have found that out. My wonder is that they could not see that England had met a foe with courage and determination equal to her own. If she conquers, it will be one of her greatest achievements.\" \n \n \"She will conquer,\" his daughter repeated, and she refused to discuss the subject further. That Britain could fail never entered her head. \n \n The Kaiser Fritz did not stop at Durban, somewhat to the astonishment of Mr. Scarse, as he had understood that it was customary, and on applying to the captain he received a gruff and discourteous reply. The man seemed anxious, and was always sweeping the sea with his glass. There was one other Englishman on board, and Mr. Scarse asked him if he could make out what all this anxiety and incivility meant. \n \n \"Perhaps she\u0027s got contraband goods on board. Ammunition and guns,\" was the reply. \"These boats usually call at Durban! My own opinion is that the captain does not want to have his ship searched.\" \n \n \"But, my dear sir, Germany is neutral.\" \n \n \"I dare say,\" the young fellow said with a grin. \"Germany is anything that suits her book. If she can smuggle in ammunition to assist the Boers you may be sure she will do it. My good sir, what with mercenaries in the Boer army, bread-stuffs, ammunition, guns and rifles being imported, we are fighting, not only the Transvaal, but the entire Continent of Europe. The Powers would give their ears to see us smashed!\" \n \n This was a somewhat new view to take of the matter, and one which did not commend itself to Mr. Scarse. He had looked upon the Boers as a handful of honest, God-fearing farmers--his favorite expression when speaking of them--struggling for their freedom against the overwhelming power of Great Britain. That they had colossal armaments, hundreds of mercenaries, and clever agents scheming for them all over the world, had never entered his head. In further conversations with this young Englishman he received considerable enlightenment, and he began to modify his views somewhat as to the absolute guilessness of Oom Paul and his gang. But he kept his opinions to himself. \n \n The Kaiser Fritz did not slip past Durban as her captain had expected. When at dawn she was almost abreast of that port she was brought to by an English cruiser. There was a polite signal to \"Heave to!\" and the German captain, with much bad language, felt himself forced to comply with the request. The news travelled quickly through the ship, and every one came on deck, amongst the foreigners being Brenda and her father and the young Englishman. The Germans were savage, and talked a great deal about the insult to the flag of the Fatherland. Abuse of England was rife, and as she listened Brenda felt her blood boil. \n \n Under the saffron sky of the dawn lay the menacing form of the cruiser, displaying the glorious flag of England. Across the deep blue of the sea came a large boat manned by the bluejackets, and no sooner were they alongside than a smart officer jumped on deck with a request to see the papers of the Kaiser Fritz. The captain blustered and swore in high and low Dutch; but the officer, though scrupulously polite, was quite firm. At last the papers were produced and examined, but no contraband goods appearing on the manifest, the vessel was allowed to proceed on her way, to the unbounded delight of the captain, whilst the English officer swore under his breath. The latter felt confident that there were guns and ammunition on board, and that the manifest was false. However, he had to appear satisfied, and prepared to return to his ship. But before leaving, he asked if Mr. Scarse and Mrs. Burton were on board. \n \n \"I am Mr. Scarse,\" said that gentleman, a good deal surprised to hear his name suddenly spoken by this stranger, \"and this is Mrs. Burton. But how did you know we were here?\" \n \n \"I will explain that when you are on board our boat, sir.\" \n \n \"But we are going on to Delagoa Bay,\" said Brenda. \n \n \"In search of Captain Burton?\" returned the lieutenant. \"In that case there is no need for you to go further. Captain Burton has escaped, and is now at Durban.\" \n \n Poor Brenda nearly fainted at this joyful and unexpected news; but the eyes of the ship--envious foreign eyes--were upon her, and she struggled bravely to keep herself in hand. The officer repeated his information, and asked them to get their things together with all speed as the German was anxious to proceed. Hardly believing the joyful news that Harold was out of the power of Van Zwieten, father and daughter went below, hastily got together their belongings, and were soon on their way to the cruiser. The Germans gave vent to an ironical \"Hoch!\" \n \n \"Brutes!\" muttered the lieutenant. \"Give way, men! Are you comfortable, Mrs. Burton?\" \n \n \"Quite--thank you,\" she said; \"but how did you know I was on board that Kaiser Fritz? How did Captain Burton escape? How did----\" \n \n \"You will get answers to all these questions on board the Juno, Mrs. Burton. But I may tell you that we expected to find you and Mr. Scarse on board the Kaiser Fritz. Of course we came in search of contraband; but we were able to kill two birds with one stone by picking you up as well. I am very glad of it too!\" and the young man, who had the true sailor\u0027s eye for beauty, looked as though he meant what he said. \n \n The boat slipped under the grey bulk of the cruiser, and they were assisted up the side--a matter of some difficulty in mid-ocean--and were received by the captain. Then he anxiously asked for his officer\u0027s report concerning the suspected contraband. It was evidently a disappointment to him, and full steam ahead for Durban was then ordered. The boat was swung on the davits, the screw revolved, and in a few moments the Juno was getting along at a great rate. Then the captain took Brenda by the arm and led her down to a cabin. \n \n \"You know that your husband has escaped, Mrs. Burton?\" he asked, smiling. \n \n \"Yes, but how did he get away? I feel so bewildered at all----\" \n \n \"Will you walk in there, please?\" was the reply. \"Some one is waiting to explain.\" \n \n Brenda began to tremble. Something told her what she might expect. As she entered, she saw a man in khaki, tall and slim, waiting for her with outstretched arms. She uttered a cry of joy. \"Oh, Harold! Harold! my darling boy! At last! at last!\" \n \n And she fell into her husband\u0027s arms. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1929/55405.html","bookId":880,"book":{"id":880,"title":"A Traitor in London","description":"简介： It\u0027s an infernal shame!I call it common sense!Call it what you please, Malet.
