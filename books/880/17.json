{"id":34667,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. CHECKMATED.","content":"Strong man as he was, Van Zwieten reeled half-fainting against the wall. It was true--the box was gone! In a flash he realized his peril. For that box held little that was not of a highly compromising nature. Once its contents were seen by the authorities--as it would seem they must be--he would be arrested as a spy, imprisoned, perhaps hanged. No ingenuity or lying on his part could explain away the damning evidence of the papers. They spoke for themselves. What a fool he had been not to have forwarded them to Leyds in the morning as he had intended to do. Now it was too late, and nothing remained but to fly to Pretoria and to throw in his lot openly with his employers. Useless now to think of going out as correspondent to an English newspaper, even were he able to manage his escape from London. Those in command at the front would surely be advised of his true character by the home authorities; and not only that, but he would be unmasked in a country under military law, where a spy such as he would receive but short shrift. Fly he must, and that at once. He must get to the Continent, and take ship for Delagoa Bay. The game was up in England; there remained now only the Transvaal. After the first emotion of terror had passed, Van Zwieten collected his wits and set to work to find some way out of the difficulty. Had he been in Russia or France he would have given himself up to despair, for there the authorities were lynx-eyed and relentless. But here in England he was amongst a people so firmly wedded to their old-fashioned laws as to freedom and justice that they might fail to take the strong measures which the situation, so far as they were concerned, demanded. He would baffle these pig-headed islanders yet, and, with a courage born of despair, he set himself to the accomplishment of this design. Mrs. Hicks, pale and tearful, had followed him into the room and had been witness of his despair. The poor woman was too much agitated to speak. This unexpected invasion of her quiet house by the police had been altogether too much for her. Van Zwieten made her sit down, and proceeded to question her. With many tears and lamentations that she had no husband to protect her, she gave him all the necessary details, and he listened with feverish anxiety to every word. \"It was about midday, Mr. Jones,\" said Mrs. Hicks; \"yes, I will not deceive you, sir, the clock was just on twelve when I heard a ring at the door. I left Mary Anne in the kitchen and went to see who it was. There was a hansom at the door, sir, and standing on the mat there was a policeman and a lady.\" \"A lady?\" put in Van Zwieten, looking rather puzzled, for he could not guess what woman could have interfered with his affairs. He had always kept himself clear of the sex. \"What lady?\" \"I don\u0027t rightly know her name, Mr. Jones, for, to be plain with you, she never gave it to me. She was a short lady, sir, with black hair and eyes--as black as your hat, sir.\" \"Dressed in mourning?\" asked the Dutchman, with a sudden flash of intuition. \"As you say, sir--dressed in mourning, and beautifully made it was, too. She asked if Mr. Jones lived here, and if he was at home. I said you did lodge with me, sir, having no reason to hide it, but that you were out. The lady stepped into the passage then with the policeman.\" \"What was the policeman like?\" \"Tall and handsome, with big black eyes and a black beard. He was something like the gentleman who came to see you last night. I beg pardon, did you speak, sir?\" But Van Zwieten had not spoken. He had uttered a groan rather of relief than otherwise. The thing was not so bad after all. In the lady he recognized the wife of Mr. Malet, though why she should have come to raid his rooms was more than he could understand. The policeman he had no difficulty in recognizing as Wilfred Burton in a new disguise. Without doubt it was he who had brought Lady Jenny Malet to the Westminster rooms. And Wilfred knew, too, of the existence of the box with its compromising contents, of which Van Zwieten himself had been foolish enough to tell him on the previous night, out of a sheer spirit of bravado--bravado which he bitterly regretted when it was too late. He swore now in his beard, at his own folly, and at Wilfred\u0027s daring. However, now that he could feel tolerably sure that the authorities had nothing to do with the seizure of his papers, he felt more at ease. After all, these private enemies might be baffled, but of this he was not so sure as he had been. The several checks which had recently happened to him had made him feel less sure of himself. \"Well, Mrs. Hicks,\" he said, rousing himself from his meditations, \"and what did these people do?\" Mrs. Hicks threw her apron over her head and moaned. \"Oh, sir!\" she said, in muffled tones, which came from under her apron, \"they told me that you were a dangerous man, and that the Government had sent the policeman to search your rooms. The lady said she knew you well, and did not want to make a public scandal, so she had brought the policeman to do it quietly. She asked me for the key, and said if I did not give it up she would bring in a dozen more policemen--and that would have ruined me, sir!\" \"And you believed her?\" cried Van Zwieten, cursing her for a fool. Mrs. Hicks whipped the apron off her head and looked at her lodger in wide-eyed amazement. \"Of course I did,\" she said; \"I\u0027m that afraid of the police as never was. Many a time have I feared when I saw poor Hicks--who is dead and gone--in the hands of the constables for being drunk, poor lamb! I wouldn\u0027t resist the police; would you, sir? \"Never mind,\" he said, seeing it was useless to argue with her. \"You let them into my rooms, I suppose?\" \"As you may guess, sir, me being a law-abiding woman, though the taxes are that heavy. Yes, sir, I took them up to your room and left them there.\" \"Ach! what did you do that for?\" \"I could not help myself, sir. The policeman ordered me to go away, and it was not for me to disobey the law. I left them there for twenty minutes, and then I came up to see what they were doing. The policeman had gone and so had the cab, though I swear to you, Mr. Jones, that I never heard it drive away. The lady was sitting, cool as you like, at your desk there, writing.\" \"What was she writing?\" \"That, sir, I don\u0027t rightly know, as she put her letter into an envelope, and here it is.\" He snatched the letter Mrs. Hicks produced from her pocket, and said something not very complimentary to that good woman\u0027s brains. She was indignant, and would fain have argued with him, but he silenced her with a gesture, and hurriedly read the letter. As he had already guessed, the writer was Lady Jenny Malet; and she merely asked him to call at her house in Curzon Street for explanations. So she put it, somewhat ironically perhaps, and Van Zwieten swore once again--this time at the phrase. He put the letter in his pocket, determined to accept the invitation, and to have it out with this all too clever lady. Meanwhile Mrs. Hicks rose to make a speech. \"I have to give you notice, sir,\" she said in her most stately tones, \"as I have not been in the habit of letting my rooms to folk as is wanted by the police. You will be pleased to leave this day week, which, I believe, was the agreement.\" \"I intend to leave this day,\" retorted her lodger. \"I told you I was going, and I have not seen fit to alter my decision. I will send for my furniture this afternoon, and I will pay your account now.\" \"Thank you, sir. I shall be most obliged, and I think you should pay me extra for the disgrace you have brought on my house. Oh,\" wailed Mrs. Hicks, \"to think I should have lodged murderers and forgers!\" Van Zwieten started at the word \"murderer,\" but he recovered himself quickly. He dismissed her with a shrug. \"Go down and make your account out,\" he said. \"You have done mischief enough already.\" \"Oh, indeed!\" cried the woman, shrilly. \"I do like you, sir, disgracing my honest house, and then turning on me! I have been deceived in you, Mr. Jones; never again will I let my lodgings to mysterious gentlemen. And when they put you in the dock, sir, I\u0027ll come and see you hanged!\" and with this incoherent speech Mrs. Hicks tottered out of the room. Left alone, Van Zwieten lost no time in vain lamentation. He had been beaten by his enemies for the present; he could only wait to see if the tide of war would turn. It would be necessary to make terms with Lady Jenny and Wilfred, for they now possessed the evidences of his employment in England. But on his side he could use his knowledge of the murder and of Harold\u0027s connection with it--as witness the revolver--to keep them quiet. If they could bite, so could he. Meanwhile he gathered together his personal belongings and packed them; he left the drawers of his desk empty, and he put the clothes of Mr. Jones into a large trunk. By the time Mrs. Hicks arrived with her bill he was quite ready. Nor had he left any evidence which would identify Mr. Jones of Westminster with Mr. van Zwieten of St. James\u0027s. Beaten he might be, but he would retreat in good order. \"This is my bill, sir,\" said Mrs. Hicks. \"I have charged nothing for the disgrace to my house!\" \"Just as well,\" retorted he. \"You would gain nothing by that. There is the money--in cash. I suppose you would prefer it to my check.\" \"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Hicks, softened somewhat by the gold, \"you have always paid up like a gentleman, I will say, and I hope they won\u0027t hang you!\" \"Thank you,\" said Van Zwieten, drily, as he fastened his glove; \"that is very kind of you. I will see after my furniture this afternoon. Is there a cab at the door? All right. Send the man up for my luggage. And, Mrs. Hicks\"--he turned on her, as Mrs. Hicks described it afterward, like a tiger--\"it will be as well for you to hold your tongue about this business. By the way, how did you know the policeman took away my box?\" \"Mary Anne was watching on the stairs, sir, and she saw the policeman come down with it,\" said the landlady, with dignity. \"Oh, I won\u0027t say anything, sir, you may be sure. I only want to keep away from the law. I hope you\u0027ll be as lucky!\" and Mrs. Hicks bowed her suspicious guest out of the house. She was immensely relieved when she saw his cab drive round the corner. In another ten minutes Mr. Jones was transformed into Mr. van Zwieten, and was established in his rooms in Duke Street, St. James\u0027s. But he had no intention of staying there long. The place was evidently too hot to hold him, or would be unless he could threaten and bully Lady Jenny and Wilfred into surrender of that precious box. In any event, his great desire was to go south. His work in England was done, and well done. Even Leyds acknowledged that. But for Van Zwieten\u0027s report of the rusty condition of the British army; the out-of-date ordnance; the little way these islanders had of putting incompetent men in office, to be rendered still more incompetent by an antiquated system of red-tapeism; and the inconceivable folly practiced of allowing the civil power to override the opinion of military experts; but for all these things the Republics--well armed though they were--would not have declared war. The world was amazed at their daring. But their two Presidents knew what they were about, and so did Leyds. His business it was to spread reports which would gain the sympathy of the Continental Powers; that of the burghers to hurl themselves on the British, all unprepared as they were through the folly of the peace party. Now that the glove had been thrown down, Van Zwieten was all eagerness to get to the front. How useful he could be to his adopted country at this juncture! But were he in the British camp as war correspondent to an English newspaper, his usefulness would be trebled. And now it seemed as though his enemies were to upset all these plans by this one coup! However, there was nothing for it now but to face them bravely and learn the worst. Then he could take what steps were possible to frustrate them. Meanwhile Brenda was pouring out her troubles to Lady Jenny Malet and telling her all about Van Zwieten and his threats. She had gone there full of anxiety to enlist the little widow\u0027s sympathies, and of indignation at the charge made by the Dutchman against Harold. Having made herself as clear as she knew how, and having related all the facts, she waited with some impatience for Lady Jenny\u0027s opinion, which was not immediately forthcoming. Indeed, it was some time before she spoke. The drawing-room was both tastefully and extravagantly furnished. Lady Jenny might be a spendthrift, but she was also an artist, and alas! her period of splendor was drawing to a close. Already Chippingholt Manor had been sold to gratify the greedy creditors of its late owner. The house in Curzon Street was her own property under her marriage settlement, and this with ten thousand pounds from the insurance office was all she had in the world. So by the advice of her lawyer she had invested the money and let the house furnished. Now she was going abroad to practice economy in some continental town. All her plans were made; and this was the last week of her prosperity. She only lingered in England at the express request of Wilfred, who had made her promise to help him all she could to trap Van Zwieten. Brenda had come on the same errand; and now Lady Jenny sat and pondered how much she could tell her about the man. \"Do speak to me,\" said Brenda. \"I am so afraid for Harold.\" \"You need not be,\" replied the widow, and her visitor noticed how worried and haggard she looked. \"He is perfectly safe, I assure you. Van Zwieten shall not harm him!\" \"But he accuses him of committing the murder!\" \"So you said. But that doesn\u0027t matter. Whoever killed poor Gilbert it was not Harold Burton.\" \"Tell me how Harold\u0027s revolver came to be found on the spot?\" \"I have an idea, but I cannot tell you--at all events, not just yet. Wait till I have seen Van Zwieten.\" \"Are you going to see him?\" \"I think so--to-night, about nine o\u0027clock. At least I left a note at his rooms which I think will bring him. I can only say that if he is a wise man he will come. Then I will settle him once and for all as far as Harold is concerned.\" \"Lady Jenny, tell me who do you think killed your husband?\" She looked at the girl sharply. \"Did your father ever tell you he had a brother?\" she asked. \"Yes, he told me all about it; and how your wicked husband ran away with his wife! I beg your pardon, I should not speak so of Mr. Malet.\" \"You need not apologize,\" the widow said bitterly, \"Gilbert deserves all the names you could have called him. He was a bad man; and even though he is dead, and though he was punished by a violent death, I have not forgiven him.\" \"Oh, don\u0027t say that; it is wrong!\" \"I know it is, but I can\u0027t help it. I have southern blood in my veins, and I never forgive. I am glad your father told you the truth--it saves me from having to repeat a very painful story. That poor uncle of yours told me all about it, and how Gilbert had deceived and ill-treated his wife. I asked my husband, and he denied the story; but I saw the woman myself and made certain it was true. Then I hated Gilbert. Not for that only--there were other things. Before he married me, and after, he deceived me. I could have taken his punishment into my own hands, but I felt sure that Heaven would check his wicked career. But to go on with my story. That night I got a note from your uncle telling me that his wife was dead. I saw Gilbert in the library and showed him the letter. It was just before he went out. I reminded him that the man--and a madman at that--was hanging about the place. The boy who brought the letter had told me so, and I warned him against going out. He laughed at me, and was most insulting. Then he went, and I never saw him again until his body was brought in. I knew then that the vengeance of Heaven had fallen!\" Brenda looked at her with a white face. \"What do you mean?\" she asked in a whisper. \"Child, can you not guess? It was Robert who had killed him!\" \"Impossible!\" cried Brenda. \"My father found my uncle and took him home with him. At the time of the murder Uncle Robert was in our cottage.\" \"Is this true?\" said the widow, and a bright color came into her face. \"Then who was the man talking to Gilbert in the library? There was some one with him just before nine o\u0027clock. I was going to the Rectory to meet Harold about your business, and I went to the library to see if Gilbert had come back. I was afraid of Robert Scarse and of what he might do, half crazed as he was by his wife\u0027s death. Little as I loved my husband, I did not want that to happen. The door of the room was locked, but I heard voices. I went out without thinking any more about it. Oh, I swear to you, Brenda, that I have always believed it was your uncle who killed him! Who was it then? The revolver!--ah! and Van Zwieten has it!\" She jumped up and clasped her hands. \"I see! I know! I know!\" \"What?\" asked the girl, rising in alarm. \"Never mind--never mind. I will tell you soon. Go now, Brenda, and leave me to see Van Zwieten. Oh, I know how to manage him now!\" \"Is it him you mean? \"He is worse than a murderer,\" Lady Jenny cried. \"He is a spy!\" \"I was sure of it. But how do you know?\" \"I know; and I can\u0027t tell you how. As to the murder, he has to do with that too. I believe he did it himself.\" \"But how do you know?\" repeated Brenda. \"How do you know?\" \"No matter. I am sure he fired that shot, and I can prove it.\" \"Prove it, and hang him!\" cried Brenda, and there was bitter hatred in her voice. The little widow sat down again, and the fire died out of her eyes. \"No, I cannot hang him, even though he is guilty. There are things--oh, I can\u0027t tell you. The man must go unpunished for the sake of--go away, child, and leave it all to me.\" \"But I want to know the truth--I must save Harold!\" \"I will save Harold. He is safe from Van Zwieten. As to the truth, you shall know it when once he is out of the country.\" Brenda had to be satisfied with this, for her friend absolutely refused to tell her any more. But she left feeling that her husband was safe from the intrigues of the Dutchman, and that was all she cared about. Left alone, Lady Jenny clenched her hands. \"If I could only hang him!\" she muttered. \"But that is impossible!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1929/55402.html","bookId":880,"book":{"id":880,"title":"A Traitor in London","description":"简介： It\u0027s an infernal shame!I call it common sense!Call it what you please, Malet.
