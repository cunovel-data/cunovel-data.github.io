{"id":34674,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.","content":"Brenda\u0027s reasoning power was not at fault in that moment of excitement. Harold, with his small patrol party, had crossed the river. She, too, was across the river--Van Zwieten had told her that. It was Harold\u0027s voice she had heard; she could not be mistaken. It was no matter of the wish being father to the thought. It was his voice she had heard--the voice of her own husband. He was there in the farmhouse with his party. \n \n \"Thank God!\" she cried, raising herself with difficulty. \n \n Where Van Zwieten was she did not know. He could not harm her now; Harold was there to protect her. Clinging to the stones of the fence in the drenching rain, she cried his name aloud again. There was silence, then the sound of many voices and the tramp of feet. \n \n \"Who goes there?\" asked a gruff, military voice. \n \n \"I--an Englishwoman--Mrs. Burton--let me in.\" \n \n The gruff voice uttered an exclamation of astonishment, and there sounded the dull thud of a rifle being grounded. Immediately afterward she heard a light footstep on the veranda of the house, and her husband\u0027s voice, surprised and incredulous. \n \n \"Brenda!\" \n \n \"Oh, Harold, Harold, it is I! Let me in--let me in!\" \n \n The gate in the wall was pushed open and several privates emerged. Someone carrying a lantern swung it so that the light fell on her pale and haggard face. Then, with a low cry of astonishment, her husband picked her up in his arms and carried her into the house. \n \n \"Good God! Brenda, what are you doing--how did you come here?\" \n \n She could not speak--she was sobbing on his breast. He placed her gently on the hard sofa. Then she found her voice. But she could think of nothing--say nothing. She could only rejoice in having found him. \n \n \"Oh, Harold, Harold! Thank God, I have been led to you!\" \n \n \"My poor girl, you are cold and wet and exhausted. Here, drink this brandy, and I\u0027ll get something cooked for you. Don\u0027t exhaust yourself more by trying to explain. That will come after.\" \n \n He had thought of her far away--safe and sound in Spearman\u0027s Camp. Even now he had some faint notion that Van Zwieten had something to do with this, though how he could have managed it he couldn\u0027t for the life of him conjecture. \n \n She smiled lovingly at him, and submitted to be wheeled in the chair to the fire. Her habit was soaking wet, and steaming now in the heat. He knelt beside her and took her hand. \n \n The room was of no great size. It was furnished quite roughly with a few chairs and a sofa, and a table of unpainted deal. Pictures from the Illustrated London News and the Graphic were on the walls; there was a portrait of President Kruger, looking even more grim than usual, over the mantelpiece; from its presence she judged that the owners of the place were rebels. Outside, the rain still came down in torrents, and in a room close by she could hear the men keeping up their spirits and doing their best to make all gay within. Making her take off her soaking habit, her husband wrapped her in his military cloak. He asked no questions, for he saw that she was not in a fit state of mind to answer them. She began once or twice to try and tell him, but he would not listen. \n \n \"When you have something to eat, dear, and have got these wet things off, then I am ready to listen to all the miracles you have to tell me, for I can\u0027t conceive how you came here in this plight except by a miracle.\" \n \n Then a woman--who so far belied the traditions of Boer female beauty as to be exceeding lean instead of stout--entered the room with a tray of smoking dishes. She was a kindly creature, and smiled pleasantly. She spoke nothing but low Dutch, and answered to the name of Tant\u0027 Wilhelmina. If she were at heart a rebel she showed no sign of hostility outwardly. She bustled Brenda into another room, and there supplied her with garments, dry certainly, but of the most wonderful design and colour. \n \n Clothed in these things--which were in truth the Boer woman\u0027s Sunday finery--Brenda came back to the sitting-room. Even such garments could not take away from her beauty, though they effectually concealed every line of her figure. She sat down to the table and ate. Harold had gone to see his men. Then she sipped a little of the brandy and sat herself down by the fire. She felt as though she would never be warm. But after all she had undergone, this peace and rest was heavenly. \n \n \"Well, dearest,\" said her husband, entering quickly, \"how do you feel now?\" \n \n \"Better--much better. Come and sit by me, Harold, and I will tell you how I come to be here. You are just dying to know, and trying not to show it for my sake!\" \n \n He unbuckled his sword and drew a chair beside his wife. \"I am very much astonished,\" he said, taking her hand in his, \"but I have an idea before you say a word. Is it Van Zwieten?\" \n \n \"Yes! I thought you might guess as much. I left the camp for a ride, and my pony bolted. Mr. van Zwieten, it appears, through the agency of a Kaffir, arranged it all by tampering with the bit. I was thrown; there I lay alone on the veldt. He came up and carried me off on his horse. When the storm burst I managed to wrench myself free and ran toward the lights in the house. But I never, never expected to find you here, dearest! It is God\u0027s mercy that has led me to you.\" \n \n \"I have only been here a few hours,\" he explained. \"Warren\u0027s division had started, and we are to remain until it comes up. How strange that we should meet here. So Van Zwieten is at his tricks again! The brute! How I wish I could get a shot at him. Did he come near the house with you?\" \n \n \"No. When he heard the shots he rode away; at least, I think so. But I am safe with you, Harold!\" \n \n \"For the time being, Brenda. But it is just as likely as not Van Zwieten, knowing where you are, will return with a Boer force and try to take the house. This is the enemy\u0027s country, and they have not yet retired before the advance. I expect the division about dawn; but there will be time for Van Zwieten to attack before then.\" \n \n \"Harold! promise to shoot me before I fall into his hands.\" \n \n The perspiration broke out on the young man\u0027s forehead. \"If the worst comes, Brenda, I will,\" he said solemnly, \"but I hope to shoot him. Of course, he may not bring any Boers up after all. They must know of Warren\u0027s advance, and I dare say they\u0027ll be afraid to linger outside their entrenchments. How did Van Zwieten find you on the veldt?\" \n \n \"He watched the camp and followed me. Oh Harold, the whole thing was a scheme of his own to get possession of me. When I escaped he was taking me to the Boer camp; and he intended to send me to Pretoria.\" \n \n \"To marry you, I suppose, after I was shot! How did he treat you, Brenda?\" \n \n Mrs. Burton met her husband\u0027s gaze fearlessly. \"With all courtesy,\" she said. \"If I had been his sister he could not have treated me better. And I had my revolver, you know, until he took it from me. \n \n \"The scoundrel! I am glad you were well treated. I have to thank him for so much consideration. But if he had not----\" Harold clenched his fist. \n \n \"I would have killed myself!\" said his wife, with equal fierceness. \"You can trust me, Harold. You don\u0027t suppose anything--anything, even torture, could change me?\" \n \n \"No, dear; I know you are the bravest little woman in the world. I have the utmost faith in you. I should be a cur if I had not. Tell me more about this brute\u0027s plotting.\" \n \n This she did, omitting no detail from the time when Van Zwieten had picked her up on the veldt to the time of her meeting with him, her husband. He ground his teeth as he listened; yet he was relieved to find things were no worse. In spite of the Dutchman\u0027s villainy, he was inclined to think better of him than he had hitherto done. Dishonourable as he was, he had at least treated a defenceless woman with respect. At the conclusion of the story he kissed her again for her bravery. \n \n \"Dearest, you have been splendid! I am a lucky fellow to have so plucky a little soul for my wife. Curse the man! I long for the moment when I shall be face to face with him. He deserves nothing better than a bullet; and he\u0027ll get it if I can shoot straight.\" \n \n \"No, don\u0027t shoot him,\" said Brenda; \"he behaved well to me. He is a spy and a scoundrel, but he is not a brute. And, Harold, I really believe he loves me truly!\" \n \n \"Who would not love you, my own?\" said her husband, tenderly. \"Yes, I can see he loves you. It is the best feeling in his black heart. All the same, I wish he would transfer this chivalrous affection to some other quarter and leave you alone.\" \n \n \"I am afraid he will never leave me alone until he dies!\" \n \n \"Then he must die!\" cried her husband, fiercely. \"I shall protect you from these insults at any cost. Curse him, I wish I had shot him at Chippingholt when he accused me of murdering Malet. But we will talk of this another time, Brenda. You are worn out. Lie down on the sofa, dear, and try to sleep. Let me put my cloak over you.\" \n \n \"But you, Harold?\" \n \n \"I must keep my eyes about me. I have an idea that Van Zwieten will bring his Boers up before dawn.\" \n \n \"If you think so, would it not be better to retreat towards the advancing column?\" \n \n \"No. I have my orders to stay here; though, of course, no attack was anticipated. Here I\u0027ll stay, Brenda, and do my duty. I have a dozen men, and in this house I daresay we can hold out until our advance guard arrives. I am not afraid for myself, but for you.\" \n \n \"Dearest, do not be afraid for me. I would rather be here than in the camp. If we are to die, we die together.\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t die; neither shall you. We\u0027ll baffle Van Zwieten yet! So far, fortune has been on our side. Now go to sleep. I must attend to my duty!\" \n \n Brenda obeyed. She was worn out with emotion and fatigue; so much so that she could not sleep. She lay flat on her back on the hard sofa, staring at the whitewashed ceiling, on which the flicker of the dying lamp made the shadows dance. Harold had taken away the lamp in case the steady light should attract attention from the outside. If Van Zwieten was about it was not improbable that he would fire where he saw a light. Brenda hoped with all her soul that he would not return. She could not bear to think that she had been the means of bringing Harold and his men into peril. But she sadly feared that, knowing where she was, the Dutchman would bring up some of the enemy, who were not far away, and would try to capture the farmhouse before the advance column came up. Full of the thought of it, worn out by anxiety and excited by the novelty of the situation, she could not close her eyes, but tossed and turned on her hard couch, longing for the daylight. The suspense was almost unbearable. \n \n The hours passed slowly. Now and then Harold would come in to give her a word of comfort; and she always replied with a bright smile and a cheerful word. \n \n The men in the other parts of the house relieved each other in watching. Captain Burton had honestly told them what they might expect. There was nothing to be gained in minimising matters. Each man--there were a dozen of them--had his rifle and revolver with a few rounds of cartridges. It was obvious they could not hold the place against any prolonged attack on account of their shortness of ammunition. But if the Boers did not commence operations until dawn, as it was improbable they would do, they on the other hand, would not have much time. Warren\u0027s column was on the march, and would be there betimes in the morning, and then the enemy would be forced to fall back on their entrenchments among the mountains unless they chose to run the risk of capture by the superior force. On the whole, Harold felt sanguine that he and his men would come out of it all right. And there was always the chance that Van Zwieten might not bring up his force, or that he might make overelaborate preparation, and thus delay the attack if he did. At worst, he could rely upon the arrival of the column very shortly. \n \n He determined that, when all was safe, he would send Brenda back to the camp. That done, he could march forward to the relief of Ladysmith with a light heart. Twice Brenda had escaped this man. She should do so a third time. \n \n Toward dawn the rain ceased and the thunderclouds rolled away, leaving a clear and starry sky. There was no moon, but the surrounding objects were faintly outlined in a kind of luminous twilight. The animals about the house commenced to wake and sniff the morning air. Burton went on to the veranda and looked out on the wild waste veldt, uncanny in the cold light of early dawn. He could discern no sign of an approaching enemy. Nevertheless, he felt anything but easy in his mind, and determined on a definite course of action. If Van Zwieten did come he would find the bird he wanted to capture flown beyond his reach. Captain Burton returned to the sitting-room and woke Brenda from the uneasy slumber into which she had fallen. \n \n \"Dearest!\" he said, sitting down and drawing her to him, \"I have a presentiment that Van Zwieten will attack this house, and I want to put you beyond his reach. I will send you forward with one of my men. There is a horse here which I can get from the Boer woman. He will take you to the advancing column and you will be sent back safely to the camp.\" \n \n But she flatly refused to do this. \"I won\u0027t leave you here to be shot. I know you can\u0027t come yourself, and I won\u0027t go without you. I suppose we could not all leave the place?\" \n \n \"No. I have my orders to remain here until the column comes up. I can\u0027t disobey, Brenda. You must go.\" \n \n \"No, no, don\u0027t send me away! I will----\" \n \n There was a shout outside and Harold sprang to his feet. \"I hope to God it is not too late!\" he cried, and hurried out. \n \n But it was too late. Across the veldt a large body of Boers were riding. The east was saffron colour, and everything for a considerable distance could be seen clearly. The sentry who had shouted pointed out the advancing column to his captain. And Harold went round the house and gave orders to bolt and bar all the windows. Then he returned to his wife and insisted that she should leave with one of the men. \n \n \"I must send a messenger back to tell them we are being attacked, and hurry them up. You must go, Brenda.\" \n \n \"No, no! A thousand times no!\" \n \n \"God help us then,\" he groaned, and went off to despatch his messenger. The enemy was riding at a canter across the grass. He took one of his lancers round by the back where the horses were picketed, and told him to ride with all speed to the advancing column, and report the danger. \n \n The man took his horse and stole quietly away, taking a wide detour to avoid the lynx eyes of the Boers. So he was away and out of sight before they reached the farmhouse by the front. Brenda could see them coming, could see Van Zwieten leading--she knew him by his golden beard. She ran to change her things, and by the time the Boers had dismounted near the fence running round the house, she was back in her riding-habit. She got a revolver from her husband, and by his orders remained in the sitting-room as the safest place. Then he kissed her fondly and went out. His men, posted at doors and windows, were all on the alert--coolly courageous, as the British soldier always is in time of peril. For the rest they were in God\u0027s hands. \n \n The yellow in the east changed to a fiery red, and all the earth was bathed in roseate hues. From the verandah Captain Burton could see the wide veldt rolling in grassy waves to the foot of the distant mountains, and a gleam of the winding river, crimson in the glare. The enemy were grouped some distance away from the fence, and he went out with two men to ask their intentions. Of course he knew too well what they were, but even in war there is a certain etiquette to be observed. After a while Van Zwieten, with a white handkerchief at the end of a stick, came forward also with two men, and stopped at the fence, whence he could talk to the English officer. \n \n \"Well, you scoundrel!\" Captain Burton said fiercely, for his soul loathed this man who was trying so hard to take his wife away from him, \"what do you want?\" \n \n \"I want Mrs. Burton, and I want you!\" \n \n \"You shall have neither--or, at best, our dead bodies.\" \n \n The other man changed colour. \"Don\u0027t be a fool, Burton,\" he said. \"I have a number of men here, and you must give in. Surrender, and I promise you that you shall go free.\" \n \n \"And my wife?\" \n \n \"I can\u0027t let her go,\" Van Zwieten said sullenly. \"I have risked too much for her sake to do that. She must come with me!\" \n \n Captain Burton stepped forward a pace, but he still kept on the verandah. His orderlies stepped forward, also stolid and courageous. \"You villains,\" said Burton, savagely, \"how dare you make such a proposal to me? If it were not for the flag you carry I would shoot you where you stand. If I were only one of your lot I should do so in spite of it! I hope to God that I shall kill you! And I will some day. You have insulted my wife for the last time, you scoundrel!\" \n \n \"I never insulted Mrs. Burton, as she will tell you herself,\" the Dutchman said coolly. \"And she will not be your wife long. I shall claim her as mine over your corpse.\" \n \n \"Do so if you can! But I want no more talk. Retire your men.\" \n \n \"Surrender to the President of the Transvaal Republic!\" was the counter demand. \n \n \"I hold this house for Her Majesty the Queen. I refuse to surrender.\" \n \n \"Your blood be on your own head, then!\" Van Zwieten turned as though to retire. Suddenly he sprang aside and flung up his hand. The Boers with him instantly had their rifles to their shoulders, and two shots rang out. Harold had just time to throw himself down, but one of his men was shot. The poor fellow flung up his arms with a cry. It had not died away before a volley came from the British soldiers within the farm; but by this time Van Zwieten and his companions had decamped and, expecting the return fire, had thrown themselves down. The larger body of Boers fired; and under cover of this the three scoundrels rolled, and afterwards ran into safety. Harold sprang back through the door, whither the other soldier had preceded him. He picked up the dead man in his arms, and, with bullets pattering about him like rain, carried the body indoors. Then the door was closed and the siege began. As the first shots came ping, ping against the red stone walls, the sun uprose in a blaze of glory, and all the veldt was flooded with golden splendour. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1929/55409.html","bookId":880,"book":{"id":880,"title":"A Traitor in London","description":"简介： It\u0027s an infernal shame!I call it common sense!Call it what you please, Malet.
