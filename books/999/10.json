{"id":24492,"no":10,"title":"Chapter Ten","content":"Dude waited outside the garage and looked at the new automobile on display in the show window. Bessie had gone inside. Dude had said he would stay on the street and look through the window a while. Bessie waited in the middle of the floor several minutes before any one came out of the back room to ask what she wanted. Presently a salesman walked over to her and asked her if she wanted anything. He noticed that there was something unusual about her nose the moment he first saw her. \"I came to buy a new Ford,\" she said. The salesman was so busy looking down into her nostrils that he had to ask her to repeat what she said. \"I came to buy a new Ford.\" \"Have you got any money?\" He glanced around to see if any of the other men were in the room. He wanted them to take a good look at Bessie\u0027s nose. \"I\u0027ve got enough to buy a new automobile if it don\u0027t cost more than eight hundred dollars.\" He looked up into her eyes for the first time. It was hard to believe from her appearance that she had as much as a penny. \"How\u0027d you get it?\" he said. \"The Lord provides for me. He always provides for His children.\" \"He ain\u0027t never sent me nothing, and I been here thirty years now. You must be on the inside some way.\" The salesman laughed at what he had said, and looked down into Bessie\u0027s nostrils again. \"That\u0027s because you don\u0027t put your trust in the Lord.\" \"You ain\u0027t got that much money sure enough, have you?\" Bessie took the check-book from her skirt pocket and showed it to him. While he was looking at the name of the bank and the balance to her account tabulated on the stub, she walked to the door and motioned to Dude to come inside. \"Who\u0027s that?\" the man said. \"Is he your kid?\" \"That\u0027s Dude Lester. Everybody\u0027s heard of the Lester\u0027s on the tobacco road. Me and Dude is going to get married to-day. As soon as we can get the new automobile we\u0027re going to ride around to the courthouse and get leave to marry.\" The salesman shoved the check-book into her hands, and ran to the door of the office. \"Come here quick, Harry!\" he said. \"I got a real sight to show you.\" An older man came out of the office and walked over to where Bessie and the salesman stood. \"What\u0027s up?\" he said, glancing from one to the other. \"This woman here is going to marry that kid, Harry--what do you know about that! Have you ever seen anything like it before?\" The older man asked Dude how old he was. Dude was about to tell him that he was sixteen when Bessie pushed him behind her. \"That\u0027s none of your business, how old he is. I want to buy a new automobile. That\u0027s what I came here for. I walked five miles this morning to get here, too.\" The\u0027 two men were whispering to each other when she had finished talking. The older one looked at her face, and when he saw the two large round holes in her nose, he stepped forward and tried to see down into her nostrils. Bessie covered her nose with her hand. \"Good God!\" he said. \"Ain\u0027t it a sight, though?\" the salesman said. \"Has she got any money?\" Harry asked him. \"Don\u0027t waste no time fooling with her if she ain\u0027t. There\u0027s a lot of them just like her who come in here from the country and never buy nothing.\" \"She\u0027s got a check-book from the Farmers\u0027 Bank in Augusta, and she said she\u0027s got eight hundred dollars in her account. The stub shows it, too.\" \"Better call them up and find out about it first,\" Harry said. \"She might be telling the truth, and she might be lying. Some of them people out in the country do some tricky things sometimes. She might have found the check-book and filled it out herself.\" They went back into the office talking about Bessie\u0027s nose, and closed the door. After the salesman had called the bank, they came out again where Bessie and Dude were waiting. \"How much do you want to pay for a car?\" the salesman said. \"Eight hundred dollars,\" Bessie told him. Harry nudged the salesman with his elbow. \"Now, this is a nice little job here,\" he said, leaning against the fender of a new touring model. \"It\u0027s eight hundred dollars. You can drive it away to-day, if you want to. You won\u0027t have to wait for the tags. I\u0027ll get them for you some time next week. You can drive a new car anywhere in the State for seven days while you are waiting for the tags to come from Atlanta.\" They winked at each other; every time they wanted to put over a quick sale they told that lie about the registration laws. Dude went to the car and blew the horn several times. The tone of it pleased him, and he grinned at Bessie. \"Do you like it, Dude?\" \"Ain\u0027t nothing wrong with it,\" he said, blowing the horn again. \"We\u0027ll take that one,\" Bessie said, pointing at the car. \"Let\u0027s see your check-book,\" the other man said, jerking it out of Bessie\u0027s hand before she could give it to him. He took the check-book, tore out a blank, and hastily filled it out for eight hundred dollars. While the man was writing the check for Bessie to sign before she could change her mind or leave the garage, the salesman was again trying to look down into her nose. He had never seen anything like it before in all his life. \"Sign your name here,\" she was told. \"I always have to make my mark,\" she said. \"What\u0027s your name?\" \"Sister Bessie Rice.\" \"You must be a woman preacher,\" the man said. \"Ain\u0027t you one?\" \"I preach and pray, both.\" She touched the end of the pen while an \"x\" was crossed after her name on the check. \"The automobile\u0027s yours,\" she was told. \"Is the boy going to drive it home for you?\" \"Wait a minute,\" Bessie said. \"I clear forgot about praying--let\u0027s all kneel down on the floor and have a little prayer before the trade is made.\" \"It\u0027s all over with now,\" one of them said. \"No it ain\u0027t, neither,\" Bessie insisted. \"It ain\u0027t over till the Lord sends his blessings on it.\" The two men laughed at her insistence, but Bessie had already knelt down on the floor and Dude was getting down on his knees beside the automobile. The two men stood behind her so they would not have to kneel on the floor. \"Dear God, we poor sinners kneel down in this garage to pray for a blessing on this new automobile trade, so You will like what me and Dude is doing. This new automobile is for me and Dude to ride around in and do the work You want done for You in this sinful country. You ought to make us not have wrecks with it, so we won\u0027t get hurt none. You don\u0027t want us to get killed, right when we\u0027re starting out to preach the gospel for You, do You? And these two men here who sold the new car to us need your blessing, too, so they can sell automobiles for the best good. They is sinful men just like all the rest of us, but I know they don\u0027t aim to be, and You ought to bless their work and show them how to sell people new automobiles for the best good, just like You would do if You was down here selling automobiles Yourself, in Fuller. That\u0027s all. Save us from the devil and make a place for us in heaven. Amen.\" Dude was the first to get on his feet. He jumped up and blew the horn six or seven long blasts. The two men came around in front of Bessie, wiping the perspiration from their faces, and laughing at Dude and Bessie. They looked at her nose again until she put her hand over it. Dude and Bessie got into the automobile and sat down. Dude blew the horn again several times. \"Wait a minute,\" the salesman said. \"We\u0027ll have to roll it outside first and fill up the tank with gas. You can\u0027t drive it like it is now.\" Bessie got out, but Dude refused to leave the horn and steering wheel. He sat where he was and guided the car through the door while the men pushed. After the gasoline had been pumped into the tank, Dude started the engine and got ready to leave. Bessie got in again, sitting in the centre of the back seat. \"Where you going now?\" the salesman asked Bessie. \"To get married?\" \"We\u0027re going around to the courthouse to get leave of the county,\" she said. \"Then we\u0027ll get married.\" The two men whispered to each other. \"Did you ever see a nose like that before, Harry?\" \"Not when I was sober.\" \"Look at them two big round holes running down into her face--how does she keep it from raining down in there, you reckon?\" \"I\u0027ll be damned if I know. Maybe she puts cork stoppers in them to keep the water out. She would have to do something like that in a hard shower.\" Bessie leaned over and prodded Dude. \"Drive off, Dude,\" she said. \"Ain\u0027t no sense in staying here no more.\" Dude put the car into gear and turned the gasoline on. Being unaccustomed to the new model, he did not know how to gauge the amount of gasoline, and the car jerked off so quickly that it almost lifted itself off the ground. The two men jumped out of the way just in time to keep from being hit by the fender. Bessie showed Dude which way to turn to find the courthouse. When they reached it, Dude got out reluctantly and followed Bessie inside. He wanted to stay in the car and blow the horn, but Bessie said he had to go with her to get the license. The Clerk\u0027s office was found at the end of the hail on the first floor, and they opened the door and went inside. There was a cardboard sign on the door that Bessie remembered seeing when she came there with her first husband. \"I want leave to get married to Dude,\" she stated. The Clerk looked at her and spread out a blank on the table. He gave her a pen and motioned to her to fill it in with answers to the questions. \"You\u0027ll have to write it for me. I can\u0027t write the words down.\" \"Can\u0027t you write?\" he asked. \"Can\u0027t you sign your name?\" \"I never learned how,\" she said. He was about to say something, when he looked up and saw her nose. His eyes opened wider and wider. \"All right, I\u0027ll put it down for you. But it ain\u0027t my business to do that for you. You ought to do it yourself. I don\u0027t get paid for writing people\u0027s names for them.\" \"I\u0027ll be powerful much obliged if you will do it for me,\" she said. \"What\u0027s your name?\" \"Sister Bessie Rice.\" \"You must be preacher Rice\u0027s widow, ain\u0027t you?\" \"He was my former husband.\" \"Who are you going to marry, Sister Rice?\" \"That\u0027s him back there by the door.\" \"Who?\" \"Dude. His name is Dude Lester.\" \"You ain\u0027t going to marry him, are you?\" \"That\u0027s what I came here to get leave of the county for. Me and him is going to get married.\" \"Who--that kid? Is he the one who\u0027s going to marry you?\" \"Dude said he would--\" \"That boy ain\u0027t old enough to marry yet, Sister Rice.\" \"Dude, he\u0027s sixteen.\" \"I can\u0027t give you a license--you\u0027ll have to wait a while and come back next year or so.\" \"Dear God,\" Bessie said, dropping to her knees on the floor, \"this man says he won\u0027t give me leave to marry Dude. God, You\u0027ve got to make him do it. You told me last night to marry Dude and make a preacher out of him, and You have got to see me through now. I\u0027m all excited about getting married. If You don\u0027t make the county give me leave to marry, I don\u0027t know what evil I might--\" \"Walt a minute!\" the Clerk shouted. \"Stop that praying! I\u0027d rather give you the license than listen to that. Maybe we can do something about it.\" Bessie got up smiling. \"I knowed the Lord would help me out,\" she said. \"Has that boy got the consent of his parents? He can\u0027t get married unless he\u0027s got the consent of both parents, according to the law for his age. What does he want to marry you for anyway? He\u0027s too young to marry an old woman like you. Come here, son--\" \"Don\u0027t you try to talk him out of it,\" Bessie said. \"If you start that, I\u0027ll pray some more. God won\u0027t let you keep us from marrying.\" \"What do you mean by coming here to marry this old woman, son? You ought to wait and marry a girl when you grow up.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Dude said. \"Bessie, there, brought me along with her.\" \"Well, I can\u0027t give you a license to marry,\" the Clerk said. \"It\u0027s against the law for a boy under eighteen years old to marry without his parents\u0027 consent. And no amount of praying can change the law, neither. It\u0027s down on the books and it won\u0027t come off.\" \"Dear God,\" Bessie began again. \"You ain\u0027t going to let this man put us off, is You? You know how much I been counting on marrying Dude. You ought not to let nothing stop--\" \"Wait a minute! Don\u0027t start that again!\" the Clerk said. \"Who are this boy\u0027s folks?\" \"His Ma and Pa don\u0027t care,\" Bessie said. \"They\u0027re glad of it. I talked to them both early this morning on the way down here to Fuller.\" \"What\u0027s his daddy\u0027s name?\" \"Jeeter Lester is Dude\u0027s Pa, and I don\u0027t reckon you would know his Ma if I was to call her name. Her name is Ada.\" \"Sure, I know Jeeter Lester, and I don\u0027t reckon he does care. Nor his wife, either. I had to give Lov Bensey a license to marry one of the young girls, because Jeeter said he wanted it done. She wasn\u0027t but twelve years old then either, and it was a shame to marry her so young. But it\u0027s in the law, and I had to do it. She was a pretty little girl. I never seen a girl before in all my life with such pretty yellow hair and blue eyes. Her eyes was exactly the same color as robins\u0027 eggs. I swear, she was one pretty sight to see.\" \"Dude is older than that,\" Bessie said. \"Dude, he is sixteen.\" \"How old are you, Sister Rice? You didn\u0027t tell me your age.\" \"I don\u0027t have to tell you that, do I?\" she said. \"That\u0027s the law. I can\u0027t give you the license if you don\u0027t state your age.\" \"Well--I was thirty-eight not so long back.\" \"How old are you now?\" \"Thirty-nine, but I don\u0027t show it yet.\" \"Who\u0027s going to support you two?\" he asked. \"That boy can\u0027t make a man\u0027s wages yet.\" \"I-s that in the law, too?\" \"Well, no. The law doesn\u0027t require that question,\u0027 but I thought I\u0027d just like to know about it myself.\" \"The Lord will provide,\" Bessie said. \"He always makes provision for His children.\" \"He don\u0027t take none too good care of me and mine,\" the Clerk said, \"and I been a supporting member of the Fuller Baptist Church since I was twenty years old, too. He don\u0027t do none too much for me.\" \"That\u0027s because you ain\u0027t got the right kind of religion,\" Bessie said. \"The Baptists is sinners like all the rest, but my religion provides for me.\" \"What\u0027s the name of it?\" \"It ain\u0027t got no regular name. I just call it \u0027Holy,\u0027 most of the time. I\u0027m the only member of it now, but Dude is going to be one when we get married. He\u0027s going to be a preacher, too.\" \"You\u0027ll have to pay me two dollars for the license,\" he said, writing on the sheet of paper, \"Have you got it?\" \"I\u0027ve got it right here. I don\u0027t see, though, why folks has to pay to get married. It\u0027s God\u0027s doings.\" \"There\u0027s something else I\u0027m going to ask you. It\u0027s not required by law, and some clerks don\u0027t ask about it, but being a good Baptist I always feel like I ought to.\" \"What\u0027s it about?\" \"Has either of you got any disease?\" \"Not that I know about,\" she said. \"Has you, Dude?\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Disease,\" the Clerk said again, pronouncing the word slowly. \"Like pellagra and chicken-pox, or anything like that. Is there anything wrong with you, son?\" \"I ain\u0027t got nothing wrong with me that I know about,\" Dude said. \"I don\u0027t know what that thing is, noway.\" \"You sure you haven\u0027t?\" he asked Bessie. \"Did your husband leave\u0027 you with disease of any kind? What did he die of?\" \"He died of age mostly, I reckon. He was well on to fifty when he was married.\" \"Has either one of you got venereal disease?\" \"What\u0027s that?\" Bessie asked. \"You know--\" he said, \"venereal disease. Maybe you call it sex trouble.\" \"I used to take a powerful number of bottles of Tanlac, but I ain\u0027t lately because I ain\u0027t had the money to buy them with.\" \"No, not that. What I\u0027m talking about comes from women sleeping with men, sometimes.\" \"My former husband had mites on him pretty bad sometimes. I had to wash both him and me off with kerosene to get rid of them.\" \"No, not mites. Lots of people get those on them. It\u0027s something else--but I reckon you ain\u0027t got it, if you don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about.\" \"What other things do you want to know?\" Bessie said. \"That\u0027s all, I reckon. Now, you give me the two dollars.\" Bessie handed him the two soiled and ragged one-dollar bills she had been gripping in her hand. She had several more in her skirt pocket, all of them rolled in a handkerchief and the ends tied together. It was all the money she had left, now that the eight hundred dollars had been paid for the new automobile. \"Well, I reckon you two will get along all right,\" the Clerk said. \"Maybe you will, and maybe you won\u0027t.\" \"Is you a married man?\" Bessie asked. \"I been married fifteen years or more. Why?\" \"Well, I reckon you know how pleased me and Dude is to get married, then,\" she said. \"All married folks know how it is to get married.\" \"It\u0027s all right at the beginning, but it don\u0027t keep up like that long. After you been married a year or two a man wants to go out and do it again all over, but it can\u0027t be done. The law puts a stop to it after the first time, unless your wife dies, or runs off, but that don\u0027t happen often enough to make it of any good.\" \"Me and Dude is going to stay together all the time, ain\u0027t we, Dude?\" Dude grinned, but he did not speak. Bessie had the license in her hand, and she did not wait to hear the Clerk talk any more. She pulled Dude out of the room, and they left the courthouse and ran to the new automobile. They got in to ride home. Dude blew the horn several times before he started the motor, and again before he put the car into gear. Then he turned it around in the street and drove it out of Fuller towards the tobacco road. Bessie sat erect on the back seat, holding the marriage license tight in both hands so the wind would not blow it away. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842/53374.html","bookId":999,"book":{"id":999,"title":"Tobacco Road 烟草路","description":"简介： 《烟草路》以喜剧性夸张手法来描写悲剧，夸大人物的古怪性格和荒唐行为，突出人物同环境之间的格格不入以及他的悲惨结局，是一部用幽默笔调表现当时美国南方生活的贫穷、愚昧、落后的杰作。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/25/10-39-17-45-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
