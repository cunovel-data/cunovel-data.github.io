{"id":24495,"no":13,"title":"Chapter Thirteen","content":"Jeeter remained seated on his heels by the chimney in the yard for half an hour after Ellie May had run away crying. He stared at the tracks left in the yard by the new automobile, amazed at the sharpness of the imprint of the tire-tread. The tires of his own car, which was still standing in the yard between the house and the corn-crib were worn smooth. When they rolled on the sand, they left no track, except two parallel bands of smoothed sand. He was wondering now what he could do about his tires. If he could pump them all up at the same time, he could haul a load of wood to Augusta and sell it. He might even get as much as a dollar for the load. It was fifteen miles to the city, and after he had bought enough gasoline and oil for the trip there and back, there would not be much left of the dollar. A quarter, possibly, with which he could buy two or three jars of snuff and a peck of cotton-seed meal. Even a quarter would not buy enough corn meal for them to eat. He had already begun buying cotton-seed meal, because corn meal cost too much. Fifteen cents would buy enough cotton-seed meal to last them a whole week. But Jeeter was not certain whether it was worth the trouble of hauling a load of wood. It would take him nearly half a day to load the car with blackjack, and a half a day for the trip to Augusta. And then after he got there he might not be able to find anybody to buy it. He still planned a crop for that year, though. He had by no means given up his plans to raise one. Ten or fifteen acres of cotton could be raised, if he could get the seed and guano. There was a mule over near Fuller he thought he could borrow, and he had a plow that would do; but it took money or an equal amount of credit to buy seed-cotton and guano. The merchants in Fuller had said they would not let him have anything on credit again, and it was useless to try to raise a loan in a bank-in Augusta. He had tried to do that three or four times already, but the first thing they asked him was whom did he have to sign his notes, and what collateral had he to put up. There was where the deal fell through every time. Nobody would sign his notes, and he had nothing to put up for security. The men in the bank had told Jeeter to try a loan company. The loan companies were the sharpest people he had ever had anything to do with. Once he had secured a two-hundred-dollar loan from one of them, but he swore it was the last time he would ever bind himself to such an agreement. To begin with, they came out to see him two or three times a week; some of them from the company\u0027s office would come out to the farm and try to tell him how to plant the cotton and how much guano to put in to the acre. Then on the first day of every month they came back to collect interest on the loan. He could never pay it, and they added the interest to the principal and charged him interest on that, too. By the time he sold his cotton in the fall, there was only seven dollars coming to him. The interest on the loan amounted to three per cent a month to start with, and at the end of ten months he had been charged thirty per cent, and on top of that another thirty per cent on the unpaid interest. Then to make sure that the loan was fully protected, Jeeter had to pay the sum of fifty dollars. He could never understand why he had to pay that, and the company did not undertake to explain it to him. When he had asked what the fifty dollars was meant to cover, he was told that it was merely the fee for making the loan. When the final settlement was made, Jeeter found that he had paid out more than three hundred dollars and was receiving seven dollars for his share. Seven dollars for a year\u0027s labor did not seem to him a fair portion of the proceeds from the cotton, especially as he had done all the work, and had furnished the land and mule, too. He was even then still in debt, because he owed ten dollars for the hire of the mule he had used to raise the cotton. With Lov and Ada\u0027s help, he discovered that he had actually lost three dollars. The man who had rented him the mule insisted on being paid, and Jeeter had given him the seven dollars, and he was still trying to get the other three to pay the balance. Jeeter swore that he would never again have anything to do with the rich people in Augusta. They had hounded him nearly every day, trying to tell him how he should cultivate the cotton, and in the end they came out and took it all away from him, leaving him three dollars in debt. He had done all the work, furnished the mule and land, and yet the loan company had taken all the money the cotton brought, and made him lose three dollars. He told everybody he saw after that, that God was not working in a deal such as that one was. He told the men who represented the finance company the same thing. \"You rich folks in Augusta is just bleeding us poor people to death. You don\u0027t work none, but you get all the money us farmers make. Here I is working all the year myself, Dude plowing, and Ada and Ellie May helping to chop the cotton in summer and pick it in the fall, and what do I get out of it? Not a durn thing, except a debt of three dollars. It ain\u0027t right, I tell you. God ain\u0027t working on your side. He won\u0027t stand for such cheating much longer, neither. He ain\u0027t so liking of you rich people as you think He is. God, He likes the poor.\" The men collecting for the loan company listened to Jeeter talk, and when he had finished, they laughed at him and got in their new automobile and drove back to Augusta. That was one reason why Jeeter was not certain he could raise a crop that year. But he thought now that if he could get the seed and guano on credit from a man in Fuller, he would not be robbed. The people in Fuller were farmers, just as he was, or as he tried to be, and he did not believe they would cheat him. But every time he had said something about raising credit in Fuller, the mer-chants had waved him away and would not even listen to him. \"Ain\u0027t no use in talking no more, Jeeter,\" they had said. \"There\u0027s farmers coming into Fuller every day from all over the country wanting the same thing. If there\u0027s one, there\u0027s a hundred been here. But we can\u0027t help you people none. Last year we let some of you farmers have seed-cotton and guano on credit, and when fall came there was durn little cotton made, and what there was didn\u0027t bring more than seven cents, middling grade. Ain\u0027t no sense in farming when things is like that. We cant take no more chances. All of us has just got to wait until the rich give up the money they\u0027re holding back.\" \"But, praise God, me and my folks is starving out there on that tobacco road. We ain\u0027t got nothing to eat, and we ain\u0027t got nothing to sell that will bring money to get meal and meat. You storekeepers won\u0027t let us have no more credit since Captain John left, and what is we going to do? I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen to me and my folks if the rich don\u0027t stop bleeding us. They\u0027ve got all the money, holding it in the banks, and they won\u0027t lend it out unless a man will cut off his arms and leave them there for security.\" \"The best thing you can do, Jeeter,\" they had said, \"is to move your family up to Augusta, or across the river in South Carolina to Horsecreek Valley, where all the mills is, and go to work in one of them. That\u0027s the only thing left for you to do now. Ain\u0027t no other way.\" \"No! By God and by Jesus, no!\" Jeeter had said. \"That\u0027s one thing I ain\u0027t going to do! The Lord made the land, and He put me here to raise crops on it. I been doing that, and my daddy before me, for the past fifty years, and that\u0027s what\u0027s intended. Them durn cotton mills is for the women folks to work in. They ain\u0027t no place for a man to be, fooling away with little wheels and strings all day long. I say, it\u0027s a hell of a job for a man to spend his time winding strings on spools. No! We was put here on the land where cotton will grow, and it\u0027s my place to make it grow. I wouldn\u0027t fool with the mills if I could make as much as fifteen dollars a week in them. I\u0027m staying on the land till my time comes to die.\" \"Have it your own way, Jeeter, but you\u0027d better think it over and go to work in the cotton mills. That\u0027s what nearly everybody else around Fuller has done. Some of them is in Augusta and some of them is in Horsecreek Valley, but they\u0027re all working in the cotton mills just the same. You and your wife together could make twenty or twenty-five dollars a week doing that. You ain\u0027t making nothing by staying here. You\u0027ll both have to go and live at the county poor-farm pretty soon if you stay here and try to raise cotton.\" \"Then it will be the rich who put us there,\" Jeeter had said. \"If we has to go to the poor-farm and live, it will be because the rich has got all the money that ought to be spread out among us all and won\u0027t turn it loose and give me some credit to get seed-cotton and guano with.\" \"You ain\u0027t got a bit of sense, Jeeter. You ought to know by now that you can\u0027t farm. It takes a rich man to run a farm these days. The poor has got to work in the mills.\" \"Maybe I ain\u0027t got much sense, but I know it ain\u0027t intended for me to work in the mills. The land was where I was put at the start, and it\u0027s where I\u0027m going to be at the end.\" \"Why, even your children has got more sense than you, Jeeter. They didn\u0027t stay here to starve. They went to work in the mills. Now, there\u0027s Lizzie Belle up there in--\" \"Maybe some of them did, but that ain\u0027t saying it was right. Dude, he didn\u0027t go, noway. He\u0027ll still here. He\u0027s going to farm the land some day, just like all of us ought to be doing.\" \"Dude hasn\u0027t got the sense to leave. If he had the sense your other children had, he wouldn\u0027t stay here. He would be able to see how foolish it is to try to farm like things is now. The rich ain\u0027t aiming to turn loose their money for credit. They\u0027re going to hold on to it to run the mill with.\" Jeeter remembered all that had been said, as he sat on his heels by the chimney, leaning against the warm bricks in the late February sun. He had heard men in Fuller say things like that dozens of times, and it always had ended in his walking out and leaving them. None of them understood how he felt about the land when the plowing season came each spring. The feeling was in him again. This time he felt it more deeply than ever, because in all the past six or seven years when he had wanted to raise a crop he had kept his disappointment from crushing his spirit by looking forward to the year when he could farm -again. But this year he felt that if he did not get the seed-cotton and guano in the ground he would never be able to try again. He knew he could not go on forever waiting each year for credit and never receiving it, because he was becoming weaker each day, and soon he would not be able to walk between the plow-handles even if credit were provided for him. It was because of his discouragement that the odor of wood and sedge smoke and of newly turned earth now filling the air, was so strong and pungent. Farmers everywhere were burning over the woods and the broom-sedge fields, and plowing the earth in the cotton lands and in the new grounds. The urge he felt to stir the ground and to plant cotton in it, and after that to sit in the shade during the hot months watching the plants sprout and grow, was even greater than the pains of hunger in his stomach. He could sit calmly and bear the feeling of hunger, but to be compelled to live and look each day at the unploughed fields was an agony he believed he could not stand many more days.. His head drooped forward on his knees, and sleep soon overcame him and brought a peaceful rest to his tired heart and body.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842/53377.html","bookId":999,"book":{"id":999,"title":"Tobacco Road 烟草路","description":"简介： 《烟草路》以喜剧性夸张手法来描写悲剧，夸大人物的古怪性格和荒唐行为，突出人物同环境之间的格格不入以及他的悲惨结局，是一部用幽默笔调表现当时美国南方生活的贫穷、愚昧、落后的杰作。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/25/10-39-17-45-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
