{"id":24497,"no":15,"title":"Chapter Fifteen","content":"Jeeter drank his third cup of chicory and cleared his throat. Dude had already left the kitchen and gone to the yard, and Sister Bessie was on the back porch combing her hair. Jeeter went down the back steps and leaned against the well. \"It would be a pretty smart deal if I was to take a load of wood to Augusta to-day,\" he said. \"Me and Dude\u0027s got a big pile of it all cut and ready to haul. Now, if we was to pile it in the new automobile it wouldn\u0027t take no time to haul it to the city, would it, Bessie?\" She finished combing her hair, stuck half a dozen pins and the rhinestone comb into it, and walked with Jeeter over to the automobile. \"Maybe it would hold a load,\" she said. \"There ain\u0027t so much room in the back seat, though.\" \"Mine holds a fair load, and it ain\u0027t no bigger than that one. They is the same kind of automobiles. The only difference being that yours is near about a brand-new one now.\" Dude turned on the switch and raced the engine. The motor hummed perfectly. The tightness that had bothered Dude the day before had gone, and the engine was in good running order. He blew the horn several times, grinning at Jeeter. \"I\u0027d sort of like to take a trip to Augusta, all right,\" Bessie said. \"Me and Dude was going there yesterday, before we changed our mind and went down to McCoy instead.\" \"It won\u0027t take long to put a load of wood in the back,\" Jeeter said. \"We can leave pretty soon. Dude-you drive the automobile out across the field yonder to that pile of wood we been cutting the past week. I\u0027ll get some pieces of baling wire to bind the load good and tight so it won\u0027t drop off.\" Bessie got in beside Dude, and they started out across the old cotton field towards the grove of blackjack. The field had grown up into four-foot broom-sedge in the past few years. Once it had been the finest piece of tobacco land on the whole farm. The rows of the last crop of cotton were still there, and as the car gathered speed, the bumps tossed Dude and Bessie up and down so suddenly and so often that they could not keep their seats. Dude grasped the steering.. wheel tightly and held himself better than Bessie could; Bessie bobbed up and down as the car raced over the old cotton rows and her head hit the top every time there was a bump. They had gone about a quarter of a mile, and were almost at the edge of the grove where the pile of blackjack was, when suddenly there was a jarring crash that stopped the car dead in its tracks. Dude was thrown against the steering-wheel and Bessie shot forward off the seat and struck her head against the wind-shield. Where her forehead had hit the glass there were a hundred or more cracks, branching out like a wet spider-web in the sunshine. None of the glass shattered, though, and the windshield was still intact. She did not know what had happened. \"Praise the Lord,\" Bessie shouted, pulling herself out of her cramped position on the floor-boards. \"What\u0027s we done this time, Dude?\" \"I reckon we rammed into a stump,\" he said. \"I clear forgot about them old dead stumps out here in the sedge. I couldn\u0027t see nothing at all for the sedge. It covers everything on the ground.\" Both of them got out and went to the front. A two-foot stump had stopped them. The blackened pine stump, hidden from view by the four-foot wall of brown broom-sedge, stood squarely in front of the axle. It was partly decayed, and except for the heart of it, the car would have knocked it down and gone ahead without any trouble. As it was, the axle was not badly bent; actually the car was going only about fifteen miles an hour, and there had not been enough force to twist the axle out of shape. The wheels had sprung forward a few inches, but aside from that, there was nothing to worry about. The car was still almost as good as new. Jeeter came running up just then with his hands and arms full of rusty baling wire, which he had found behind the corn-crib. They did not have to tell him what had happened, because he could see just as well as they did that the front axle had hit the stump and sprung the wheels forward several inches. \"It don\u0027t appear to be hurt much,\" he said. \"Maybe it ain\u0027t hurt none at all. We has got to haul a load of wood to Augusta to-day, because there ain\u0027t no more meal and chicory in the house to eat.\" Bessie watched Dude start up the engine and back away from the stump. He swung around it, and drove carefully the remaining few yards to the pile of blackjack. Jeeter began picking up the pieces of scrub oak and hurling them like javelins into the back seat. \"I reckon I\u0027d better put the top down,\" Dude said. \"It don\u0027t hold much unless the top\u0027s down.\" He began unfastening the set screws holding the top to the wind-shield, while Jeeter and Bessie continued to hurl blackjack into the back seat. \"There won\u0027t be no room for Ada to go along, too, will there?\" Jeeter said. \"She\u0027ll be powerful put out when she sees us drive off to Augusta and not stopping to take her along. The last time me and Dude went up there in my car, she and Ellie May like to had a fit, but it wasn\u0027t no use, because we needed all the room for wood.\" \"Well, I ain\u0027t going to stay at home,\" Bessie said. \"I\u0027m going just as big as the next one. You can\u0027t make me stay here.\" \"I\u0027m going,\" Dude said. \"Can\u0027t nobody make me stay here. I\u0027m going to drive the car.\" He had thrown the top back and was trying to tie it down. Most of it had been folded up, but some of it hung down as far as the rear axle. He could not find any means for making it stay folded, so he allowed it to hang down behind. \"I sure ain\u0027t going to miss going,\" Jeeter said. \"It\u0027s my wood I\u0027m taking to sell. I\u0027m going to be the first one to go.\" The scrub oak had been cut into carrying lengths the past week when Jeeter and Dude had spent a day in the grove getting a load ready to sell. Some of it was a foot in length, but most of it was anywhere from three to six feet long. The length in which it had been cut was the length of the stunted trees after they had been hacked off with an axe at the stump. As soon as a tree was hacked down, Jeeter had taken the axe and broken the limbs off, and then the wood was ready to haul. The blackjack never grew much taller than a man\u0027s head; it was a stunted variety of oak that used its sap in toughening the fibres instead of growing new layers and expanding the old, as other trees did. The blackjack sticks were about two or three inches in diameter, and wiry and tough as heavy pieces of wire or small iron water-pipes. It took them about half an hour to pile on as much wood as the back seat would hold. After that, Jeeter began binding it to the body with baling wire so none of it would drop off along the road while they were riding to Augusta. The ends of the blackjack protruded in all directions, sticking out several feet on each side and behind. Others had been jabbed straight into the upholstery, and they appeared to be the only ones that did not need fastening. The rusty baling wire broke nearly every time Jeeter attempted to fasten it to the door-handles, and he would have to stop and splice the ends, twisting them until they would hold. The task of loading the blackjack and tying it on to the car took nearly two hours, and even then several pieces of wood fell off when one of them touched the car or leaned against it. With the wood in place, Dude drove back across the field towards the house, going no faster than a man\u0027s walk, but even then the wood persisted in falling off. Jeeter and Bessie came behind, picking up the sticks and carrying them to the house. Ada and Ellie May were in the yard when they got there. The grandmother waited behind a chinaberry tree to see what they were going to do. Ada stood squarely in front of the car, waiting to find out where she was going to sit. The grandmother went to the corner of the house and stood there, all except her face hidden from view. \"Where is I going to sit and ride?\" Ada said. \"I don\u0027t see no sitting place for nobody much, with all that wood you got loaded.\" Jeeter waited several minutes, hoping that Bessie would undertake to answer Ada. When she did not, Jeeter got in and sat down beside Dude. \"There ain\u0027t no room for you,\" he said. \"Why ain\u0027t there no room for me, if there\u0027s room for you and Dude and that hussy, there?\" \"Sister Bessie ain\u0027t no hussy,\" Jeeter said. \"She ain\u0027t nothing like that. She\u0027s a woman preacher.\" \"Being a woman preacher don\u0027t keep her from being a hussy. That. could help to make her a bigger one. Something acts that way, because she is a big old hussy.\" \"What makes you say that about Bessie?\" he said. \"Last night she was walking all around the room with none of her clothes on. If I hadn\u0027t made you put on your overalls when I did, there ain\u0027t no telling what she might have done. She\u0027s a hussy.\" \"Now, Ada,\" he said, \"you ought not to talk like that about Bessie. She\u0027s a woman preacher, and she\u0027s married to Dude, too.\" \"That don\u0027t make no difference. She\u0027s a hussy, all the same. She always fools around with the menfolks. She don\u0027t never stay in the house and help clean it up like I has to do. She\u0027s taking after the men-folks because she\u0027s a hussy. When she goes preaching, she always does the preaching to the men-folks and don\u0027t pay no attention to the women-folks at all.\" \"I ain\u0027t got nothing to say against Sister Bessie. She\u0027s a woman preacher, and what she does is the Lord\u0027s doings. He instructs her what to do.\" \"Ada is peeved because I married Dude and came here to stay,\" Bessie said to Jeeter. \"She don\u0027t like it because I\u0027m going to stay in the room.\" \"You shut your mouth now, Ada,\" Jeeter said, \"and let us be going. I got to sell this load of wood in Augusta today.\" Dude started the car, and Bessie got in and sat on the edge of the seat beside Jeeter. There was barely enough room for all three of them. Ada ran towards them, trying to jump on the running board, but Dude speeded up the car and she could not get on. When he suddenly cut the wheels and turned out of the yard into the tobacco road, the rear wheel barely missed running over Ada\u0027s feet. She shouted after them, but the car was going so fast by that time that it was useless to run after them and try to stop them. She went back into the yard and, with Ellie May, stood looking at the cloud of dust that hid the car from view. The grandmother came from behind the corner of the house and, picking up the old croker sack, started to the thicket for dead twigs. She was already hungry again, although she had had a cup of chicory only two or three hours before. Dude slowed down when they approached the crossroad where they were to turn off the tobacco road and enter the State highway to Augusta. He did not slow down enough, however, because the momentum swung the load of blackjack to the offside, and the entire top of the pile fell in the road. Jeeter and Dude worked half an hour getting the wood in place again, and with Bessie helping the little that she could, it was then ready to be tied down again. Jeeter went across the field to a negro cabin and borrowed two plow-lines. He came back and threw them over the wood and tied the ends down tightly. \"Now, that will hold it, durn that blackjack,\" he said. \"There ain\u0027t nothing else in the world like plow-lines and baling wire. The two together is the best in the world to do anything with. Give me a little of both and I can do any kind of job.\" They were off again, speeding down the highway towards Augusta. The city was now only twelve miles away. Dude was a good driver, all right; he swung out of the tracks just at the right moment every time he met another automobile. Only two or three times did he almost run head-on into other cars. He was so busy blowing the horn that he forgot to drive on the right hand side of the road until the last minute. Most of the cars they met gave them plenty of road when they heard the horn blowing. Jeeter could not talk, because he was holding his breath most of the time. The swiftness of the car frightened him so badly he could not answer Bessie\u0027s questions. She looked grimly ahead most of the time, proud of her automobile and hoping that the Negroes and farmers they passed in the fields beside the road would know it belonged to her instead of thinking it was Jeeter\u0027s or Dude\u0027s. It was between noon and one o\u0027clock when they reached the half-way point. Augusta was then only a little over seven miles away, and when they got to the top of the last hill they would be able to see the city down in the valley beside the big muddy river. The last hill they had to climb before reaching that point was a long one. It was a mile and a half from the creek at the bottom to the filling-station on top, and they were about half way up, when suddenly the car slowed down to a few miles an hour. The water was boiling in the engine and radiator, and steam shot higher than the top of the wind-shield. The engine was making a great noise. It sounded as if it were knocking in the same way that Jeeter\u0027s old car had, only a little harder and a little louder. \"What\u0027s the matter with us?\" Bessie said, leaning over the door and looking around outside. \"It must have got hot climbing the bill,\" Dude said. \"I don\u0027t know what else is wrong with it.\" They went a hundred yards and the car stopped. The engine choked down, and steam whistled out of the pipes like pistons on a freight train at the coal chute. Jeeter jumped out and shoved a big rock under the rear wheel before Dude could put on the brake. The car stopped rolling backward. \"What\u0027s the matter with it, Dude?\" Bessie said again. \"Is something gone wrong?\" \"I reckon it just got hot,\" he said. He made no effort to get out. He sat under the steering-wheel, grasping it tightly and jerking it from side to side as far as it would go. Presently he began blowing the horn again. \"That won\u0027t help it none, Dude,\" Jeeter said. \"You\u0027ll wear out that durn horn before you know it, if you keeping doing that all the time. Why don\u0027t you get out and try to do something?\" Several automobiles passed them at high speed, going up the hill and coming down, but none of them slowed up or stopped to offer help. Another car was coming slowly up the hill behind them. It was coming very slowly in low gear, and it was steaming like Bessie\u0027s new car. As it chugged slowly past them, some of the Negroes leaned out and looked at the stalled automobile. One of them called to Jeeter. \"What\u0027s the matter with your automobile, white-folks? It looks like it ain\u0027t going to run no more.\" \"By God and by Jesus!\" Jeeter said, angrily. \"What\u0027s your name, nigger? Where you from?\" \"We come from Burke County,\" he said. \"What you want to know that for, white-folks?\" Before Jeeter could say anything more, the Negroes\u0027 car was a hundred yards up the hill, and gaining speed. Jeeter had been going to make them pull Bessie\u0027s car up the hill, if he could have stopped them. Dude cranked up the engine and put the car into gear. Jeeter and Bessie hopped on the running-board just in time, because Dude soon had the car going fast. The engine had cooled, and they were going faster than the Negroes\u0027 car. They gained on the car ahead and were getting ready to pass it, when suddenly the engine began knocking louder than ever, and they came to a stop. \"This is the durndest automobile I ever saw,\" Jeeter said. \"It don\u0027t do the same thing long enough to make me accustomed.\" They had stopped this time on top of the hill. Dude was getting ready to let it roll down, when Jeeter saw the filling-station, and he told Dude to wait a minute. \"I\u0027ll bring some water and put it in,\" he said. He crossed the road and went into the filling-station. He was back in a few minutes carrying a bucket of water. The man who ran the station came out with him. While Jeeter was unscrewing the radiator cap, the other man was raising the hood to measure the oil. \"The trouble with you people, brother,\" he said, \"is you ain\u0027t got a drop of oil in your car. Your bearings is burned out. How far did you come from?\" Jeeter told him they lived near Fuller on the old tobacco road. \"You\u0027ve already ruined your new car,\" he said. \"That\u0027s a shame. I hate to see people who don\u0027t know no better ruining automobiles.\" \"What\u0027s wrong with it now?\" Bessie said. \"Your new car is ruined, sister. It\u0027ll take a gallon and a half of oil to put enough in it to run on. Do you want me to fill it up for you?\" \"How much does it cost?\" Bessie said. \"A dollar and a half.\" \"I didn\u0027t aim to pay out money on it.\" \"Well, it won\u0027t run no more unless you put oil in it. It looks to me like you didn\u0027t have enough in it to start with.\" \"I ain\u0027t got but two dollars,\" she said. \"I was going to buy gasoline with most of that.\" \"Me and Dude ain\u0027t got none,\" Jeeter said. \"But when I sell this load of wood, I\u0027ll have a dollar and a half, maybe.\" \"You pour the oil into it,\" Bessie said. \"I don\u0027t want to ruin my new automobile. I bought it brand new in Fuller yesterday.\" \"It\u0027s already ruined, sister,\" the man said, \"but you\u0027ll have to put oil in it if you\u0027re going in to Augusta and back to Fuller again.\" They waited while he poured the oil in, and then Bessie gave him the money. She had the bills tied in a handkerchief, and it took her several minutes to untie the hard knots. Dude started the engine, and they moved slowly off the hill-top and rolled down the long grade to Augusta. The car was like new again by the time they reached the bottom of the hill, but the engine made more noise than the one in Jeeter\u0027s car. The bearings and connecting rods were so loose they made a jingling sound when the car was going more than fifteen miles an hour down hill. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842/53379.html","bookId":999,"book":{"id":999,"title":"Tobacco Road 烟草路","description":"简介： 《烟草路》以喜剧性夸张手法来描写悲剧，夸大人物的古怪性格和荒唐行为，突出人物同环境之间的格格不入以及他的悲惨结局，是一部用幽默笔调表现当时美国南方生活的贫穷、愚昧、落后的杰作。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/25/10-39-17-45-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
