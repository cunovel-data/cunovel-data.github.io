{"id":24494,"no":12,"title":"Chapter Twelve","content":"When Dude looked up, he saw that the door had been opened and that Ellie May, Ada, and the grandmother were crowding through it. He did not know what to do, but he tried to motion to them to go away. He could not see Jeeter, because Jeeter was behind him, standing half-way up in the window with his feet supported on one of the rungs of the ladder. Bessie saw Jeeter, but she could not see the others. Dude heard his grandmother groan and walk away. He could hear her feet sliding over the pine boards of the hail floor, the horse-collar shoes making an irritating sound as she went towards the front yard. He paid no more attention to the others. After a while Jeeter cleared his throat and called Bessie. She did not answer him the first time he called, nor the next. Neither she nor Dude wanted to be disturbed. When she persisted in not answering him, Jeeter climbed through the window, and walked across the room to the bed. He shook Dude by the collar until he turned around. Jeeter, however, did not have anything to say to Dude. It was Bessie he wanted to speak to. \"I been thinking just now about it, Sister Bessie, and the more I think it over in my mind, the more I convince myself that you was right about what we was discussing yesterday on the porch.\" \"What you want with me, Jeeter?\" she asked. \"Now, about that place in the Bible where it says if a man\u0027s eye offends God he ought to go and take it out.\" \"That\u0027s what the Bible says,\" she answered. \"I know It does. And that\u0027s what\u0027s worrying my soul so bad right now.\" \"But you is a religious man, Jeeter,\" she said. \"Nothing ought to bother your conscience now. I prayed for you about them turnips you took from Lov. The Lord has forgot all about it now. He ain\u0027t going to hound you none on that account.\" \"It ain\u0027t about the turnips. It\u0027s about cutting myself off. Now, I reckon what you said was right. I ought to go and do it.\" Dude turned around and tried to push Jeeter to the floor. Jeeter clung to the bedstead, and would not move away. \"Why you want to do that?\" Bessie said. \"I been thinking about all you said so much that right now I know I ought to go ahead and cut myself off, so the Lord won\u0027t let me be tempted no more. I offended Him, and I know I ought to cut myself off so I won\u0027t do it no more. Ain\u0027t that right, Sister Bessie?\" \"That\u0027s right,\" she said. \"That\u0027s what the Bible says a man ought to do when he\u0027s powerful sinful.\" Jeeter looked at Bessie. He pulled back the quilt so he could see her better. \"Maybe I can put it off a little while, though,\" he said, after thinking several minutes. \"Now, maybe it ain\u0027t so bad as I thought it was. This time of year puts a queer feeling into a man, and he says a lot of things he don\u0027t stop to take into account. Along about when the time to plow the land and put seed in the rows comes around, a man feels like he ain\u0027t got no control over his tongue--and don\u0027t want none. It\u0027s the same way with his actions. I feel that way every late February and early March. No matter how many children a man\u0027s got, he always wants to get more.\" There was a silence in the house for a long time. Ellie May and Ada made no sound in the doorway. Jeeter sat on the bed deep in thought until Dude pushed him to his feet. Dude climbed out behind him. When all of them were out in the yard again, Dude sat in the automobile and blew the horn. The women were busy wiping off the dust that had settled on the hood and fenders. The grandmother, though, did not come close to the car. She took her place behind a chinaberry tree and watched every movement of the others. Jeeter sat on his heels beside the chimney, and thought over what Sister Bessie had said in the house. He was more convinced than ever that God expected him to fix himself so he would not have any more sinful thoughts about Bessie. He decided, however, not to carry out his intentions just then. There was plenty of time left yet, he told himself, when he could go ahead and cut himself off, and so long as he did it before he offended God any more, it would be satisfactory. In the meanwhile, he would have time in which to try to convince himself more thoroughly that he should do it. There was a little fat-back on rinds left in the kitchen, and Ada had baked some cornbread. The bread had been made with meal, salt, water, and grease. All of them sat down at the table in the kitchen and ate the fat-back and cornbread with full appetite. It was the first time that day that any of them had had food, and it would probably be the last. After the meat plate had been wiped clean of grease, and after the last of the cornbread was eaten, they went out into the yard again to look at the new automobile. The grandmother had hidden a piece of the bread in her apron pocket, and she put it under the mattress of her bed so she would have something to eat the next day in case Jeeter failed to buy some more meal and meat. Jeeter wanted to take a ride right away. He told Bessie he wanted to go, and that he was ready. Bessie had other plans, however. She said she and Dude were going to take a little ride that afternoon all alone, so they could talk over their marriage together without any disturbance. She promised Jeeter she would let him ride when they came back. She and Dude got in, and Dude drove the car out of the yard and into the tobacco road towards the State highway. Jeeter thought they might be going to Augusta, but before he could ask them if they were, they had gone too far to hear him call. \"That Dude is the luckiest man alive,\" he told Ellie May. \"Now ain\u0027t he?\" Ellie May started down the road through the cloud of dust to see him leave. She heard Jeeter talking to her, but she was too much interested in seeing the new car go down the road and in hearing Dude blow the horn to listen to what Jeeter said. \"Dude, he has got a brand-new car to ride around in, and he\u0027s got married all at the same time,\" Jeeter continued. \"There\u0027s not many men who get all that in the same day, I tell you. The new car is a fine piece of goods to own. There ain\u0027t nobody else that I know of between here and the river who has got a brand-new automobile. And there ain\u0027t many men who has a wife as fine-looking as Sister Bessie -is at her age, neither. Bessie makes a fine woman for a man--any man, I don\u0027t care where you find him. She might be just a little bit more than Dude can take care of though, I fear. It looked to me like she requires a heap of satisfaction, one way and another, for a little woman no bigger than a gal. I don\u0027t know if Dude is that kind or not, but it won\u0027t take long for Bessie to find out. Now, if it was me, there wouldn\u0027t be no question of it. I\u0027d please Sister Bessie coming and going, right from the start, and keep it up clear to the end.\" Now Ellie May heard what Jeeter was saying, and it interested her. She waited to hear more. \"Now, you, Ellie May, it\u0027s time you was finding yourself a man. All my other children has got married. It\u0027s your time next. It was your time a long while ago, \u0027way before Pearl and Dude got married, but I make allowances for you on account of your face. I know it\u0027s harder for you to mate up than it is for anybody else, but in this country everybody has got to get mated up. You ought to go out and find yourself a man to marry right away, and not wait no longer. It might be too late pretty soon, and you don\u0027t want that to happen. It ain\u0027t going to get you nowhere fooling around with Lov like you was doing, because you can\u0027t get him that way. He\u0027s already married. It\u0027s the unmarried men you has got to get. There\u0027s a fine lot of boys running that sawmill over at Big Creek. You can walk over that way some day and make them take notice of you. It ain\u0027t hard to do. Women know how to make men take notice of them, and you\u0027re old enough to know all about it at your age. Them boys at the sawmill down there at Big-Creek ought to take a liking to you in spite of the way you look in the face. When a man looks at you from behind, he ought to want to mate up with you right there and then. That\u0027s what I heard Lov say one time, and he ought to know, because he\u0027s mated up now. Just don\u0027t show your face too much, and that won\u0027t stop the boys from getting after you.\" When Jeeter looked at Ellie May again, she was crying. It was about the first time he had even seen her cry since she was a baby. He did not know what to do about it, nor to say about it, because he had never before had the occasion to try to calm a crying woman. Ada never cried. She never did anything. Before he could ask her what the matter was, she had run off into the old cotton field; she ran towards the woods behind the house, jumping through the brown broom-sedge like a frightened rabbit. \"Now, I never seen the likes of that before,\" Jeeter said, \"I wonder what it was that I could have said that made her carry-on like that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842/53376.html","bookId":999,"book":{"id":999,"title":"Tobacco Road 烟草路","description":"简介： 《烟草路》以喜剧性夸张手法来描写悲剧，夸大人物的古怪性格和荒唐行为，突出人物同环境之间的格格不入以及他的悲惨结局，是一部用幽默笔调表现当时美国南方生活的贫穷、愚昧、落后的杰作。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/25/10-39-17-45-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
