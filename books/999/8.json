{"id":24490,"no":8,"title":"Chapter Eight","content":"There was nothing Jeeter could find to do in the sand hills that would pay him even a few cents a day for his labor. There were no farmers within twenty miles who hired help, because practically all of them were in Jeeter\u0027s condition, some of them in an even worse one; nor were there any lumber mills or turpentine stills anywhere near the tobacco road that would employ him. The only job in the surrounding country was the one at the coal chute, and Lov had held it since the Augusta and Georgia Southern Railroad was first built. Even if Jeeter could have taken the job away from Lov, the work would have been too hard for him to do. Filling the big iron scoops all day long and rolling them to the edge of the structure where they were dumped into the engine tenders, required a strong back and stronger arms. Lov could do the work, because he had become accustomed to doing it. For Jeeter to attempt such hard labor in the weakened condition he was in would have been foolish even if the railroad would have hired him. The hope that he would find Tom was Jeeter\u0027s sustaining strength. Behind his hopeful belief that Tom would give him some money lay his fear of dying without a suit of clothes to be buried in. He had developed a growing horror of dying in overalls. Ada, too, talked a lot about getting clothes to die in. She wanted a silk dress, and it mattered little to her whether the color was red or black, so long as it was stylish in length. Ada had a dress she had been keeping several years to die in, but she was constantly worried for fear that the dress might not be of the correct length. One year it was stylish to have dresses one length, and the next year they were mysteriously lengthened or shortened several inches. It had been impossible for her to keep up with the changes; consequently, even though she had a dress put away, she still tried to make Jeeter promise to buy her a new one that would be in style and in keeping with the times when she should die. Ada believed she would die almost any day. She was usually surprised to wake up in the morning and discover that she was still alive. The pellagra that was slowly squeezing the life from her emaciated body was a lingering death. The old grandmother had pellagra, too, but somehow she would not die. Her frail body struggled day after day with the disease; but except for the slow withering of her skin and flesh no one was able to say when she would die. She weighed only seventy-two pounds now; once she had been a large woman, and she had weighed two hundred pounds twenty years before. Jeeter was angry with her because she persisted in living, and he would not let her have any food when he could keep her from eating. However, she had learned how to find her own means of sustenance, such as it was. How she did it, no one knew. Sometimes she would boil leaves and roots, at other times she would eat wild grass and flowers in the fields. Jeeter had already given implicit instructions regarding his own burial. He had impressed upon both Ada and Lov the importance and necessity of carrying out his plans. He expected to outlive Ada; but in case he should be killed in his automobile, he had made her promise to buy him a suit of clothes. If that was impossible, she was to go to Fuller and ask some of the merchants to give her an old suit for him. Lov, too, had had to swear that he would see that Jeeter was buried in a suit of clothes instead of in overalls. But there was another thing connected with his death that was of equal importance. Jeeter had a horror of rats. That was strange, because he had lived with them around him all his life, and he knew their ways almost as well as he did those of men. His reason for hating rats was because of an incident that had happened when his father died while Jeeter was a young man. The old Lester had died in the same house Jeeter now occupied, and he was buried on the following day. That night, while Jeeter and the other men were sitting up with the body, some one had suggested that they all go to Fuller and get some Coca-Colas and tobacco. They were to sit up all night, and they had felt the need of something to drink and something to smoke. As all of the men, including Jeeter, had wanted to go to Fuller, they had put the body in the corn-crib and locked the door. The crib was the only place on the farm where anything could be locked up and found intact later. Negroes and white men had a habit of coming by the Lester house during the night and carrying away anything that had been left unprotected. None of the doors of the house had locks on them, but the crib door did have a lock. The men had placed the body inside, locked the door and put the key away, and had driven to Fuller for the Coca-Colas and tobacco. They returned to the house about three or four hours later. As soon as the mules were unhitched from the buggies and tied to the wagon wheels for the rest of the night, the men unlocked the crib door, lifted out the wooden box, and carried it back into the house. The remainder of the night was spent in watching the casket, drinking Coca-Cola\u0027s, and smoking and chewing tobacco. The following afternoon at the funeral, just as the casket was about to be lowered into the grave, the top was lifted off in order that the family and friends might take a last look at the deceased. The lid was turned back and just as it was fully open, a large corn-crib rat jumped out and disappeared in the woods. Nobody knew how the rat had got inside until someone found a hole in the bottom of the wooden box where the rat had gnawed through while it was locked in the crib. One by one the people filed past the casket, and each time it became the next person\u0027s turn to look at the body, a strange look came over his face. Some of the women giggled, and the men grinned at each other. Jeeter ran to the side of the box and saw what had happened. The rat had eaten away nearly all of the left side of his father\u0027s face and neck. Jeeter closed the lid and had the box lowered into the grave immediately. He had never forgotten that day. Now that the time was coming when he would soon die, Jeeter had become more insistent than ever that his body was not to be put into a corn-crib or left where the rats could reach it. Lov had promised faithfully to see that the rats did not get to him before he was buried. \"You\u0027ve got to swear to me you won\u0027t let me be left in the box where the rats can get me,\" Jeeter had said dozens of times. \"I declare before the good Lord, Lov, that ain\u0027t a fit way to treat the dead. I\u0027ve regretted my own father\u0027s circumstances every day since that happened, and I declare before the Lord, I sure don\u0027t want that thing to happen to me when I\u0027m dead and can\u0027t do nothing about it.\" \"You don\u0027t need to worry none,\" Lov had said. \"I\u0027ll dig a hole and put you in it right after you\u0027re gone. I won\u0027t wait for the next day, even. I\u0027ll put you in the ground the same hour you die, almost. I\u0027ll take care of your body. Don\u0027t you worry none.\" \"Just don\u0027t put the coffin in that durn corn-crib, Lov, no matter what else you do. There ain\u0027t no rats staying in there now since I ain\u0027t had corn in it for nearly five years, but they take trips back here every once in a while from the place they\u0027re staying at now just to make sure there. ain\u0027t been no corn put in it. Before they left they et up mule collars and everything else they could get hold of, they was that mad at me for not putting corn in there for them.\u0027 I used to bust them on the head with sticks, but that didn\u0027t stop them from coming back every once in a while. I was in there not so long ago. getting me some corn cobs and one of them bit my leg before I could get out. They have sure got it in good and heavy for me, because I don\u0027t put no corn in there for them to eat up.\" Ada, too, had promised Jeeter to see that his body would not be left exposed to the rats that he hated so much. But Jeeter did not worry her as much as he did Lov, because he believed he would out-live her by several years. Ada herself looked as if she might die before Jeeter did. Her teeth had all dropped out; she had dipped snuff since she was eight years old. Her teeth had not lasted very long after she was married. Her one concern, besides the constant desire for more snuff, was with her own death. The thought that she might not have a stylish dress when she died was bothering her night and day. She did not trust Jeeter any too much to furnish it when the time came; that was the reason she kept the old dress put away to be used in case a more up-to-date one was not bought for her. \"If I could find out where my daughters was living, maybe they would help me get a stylish dress to die in,\" she had said. \"Lizzie Belle used to love her old Ma a lot. I know she\u0027d help me get one if I could find out where she is at. And Clara might help some, too. She used to tell me how pretty I looked when I combed my hair of mornings and put on a clean apron and sunbonnet. I don\u0027t know if the others would want to help none or not. It\u0027s been such a long time since I saw the rest of them I\u0027ve just about forgot what they was like. Seems like I can\u0027t recall all their names even, sometimes.\" \"Lizzie Belle might be making a lot of money over in the mills,\" Jeeter had said, \"Maybe if we was to find her and ask her about it, she might come some time and bring us a little money. I know Bailey would bring us some snuff and rations if I knowed where to find him. Bailey was just about the best of all the boys. He was good to me even when he was just a little boy. He was never stealing all the molasses we had saving for supper, like the rest of them. I expect maybe he\u0027s got to be a pretty big merchant somewheres by now. He always said he was going to make a lot of money so he wouldn\u0027t have to go barefooted in the wintertime like Tom and Clara did when they went away.\" Ada talked to Jeeter whenever the subject was that of their children away from home. It seemed as if she were not interested enough in other things to talk about them any more. She answered Jeeter\u0027s questions most of the time, and she scolded him when there was nothing in the house to eat. The rest of the time she had very little to say. But whenever Bailey\u0027s name, or Lizzie Belle\u0027s, or Clara\u0027s, or Walker\u0027s, or any of the children was mentioned, she lost the hollow look in her eyes and wanted to talk about them for the rest of the day. None of the children who had left home had ever come back to visit, nor had they ever sent a message. Because Ada and Jeeter had never received one, they believed that all of the children were alive. There was no way of knowing whether they were dead or not. \"I\u0027m going over to Burke County and see Tom,\" Jeeter had told Ada. \"I\u0027ve made up my mind that I\u0027ll go over there and see him before I die. Everybody in Fuller tells me he\u0027s hauling cross-ties out of\u0027 the camp by the wagon load day and night. They say he\u0027s got a whopping big cross-tie camp over there. From what people say about him, I reckon he\u0027s a powerful rich man now. He sure ought to give me some money. Though it sometimes looks like a rich man will never help the poor; whereas the poor people will give away everything they has to help somebody who ain\u0027t got nothing. That\u0027s how it looks to me. Don\u0027t seem like it ought to be that way, but I reckon the rich ain\u0027t got no time to fool with us poor folks.\" \"When you see Tom, tell him that his old Ma would like powerful much to see him. You tell him that I said he was near about the best of the whole seventeen. Clara and Lizzie Belle was about the best, I reckon; but Tom and Bailey led the boys when it came to being good children. You tell Tom I said he was the best of them, and maybe he\u0027ll send me some money for a stylish dress.\" \"Pearl is the prettiest,\" Jeeter said. \"Ain\u0027t none of the other girls got pretty yellow hair like she has. Nor them pale blue eyes, neither. She\u0027s the first Lester I ever saw who had yellow hair. It\u0027s funny about her having it, ain\u0027t it, Ada?\" \"Pearl is my favorite, I reckon,\" Ada said. \"I wish she would come to see me sometimes. I ain\u0027t seen her since she left last summer to get married to Lov.\" \"I\u0027m going to tell Tom he ought to give me some money,\" Jeeter said. \"The folks in Fuller say he\u0027s a powerful rich man now.\" \"You better not forget to mention to him that his old Ma sure would like for him to get her a stylish dress to die in. I know he won\u0027t stand back with a little of his money for a little thing like that.\" \"I\u0027m going to mention it to him when I see him, but I don\u0027t know how he\u0027ll take it. I expect he\u0027s got a wife and a raft of children to provide for. Maybe he\u0027ll give it to me, though.\" \"Reckon Tom has got some children?\" \"Maybe some.\" \"I sure would like to see them. I know I must have a whole lot of grandchildren somewhere. I\u0027m bound to have, with all them boys and girls off from home. If I could see Tom maybe I wouldn\u0027t mind it so bad that I can\u0027t see the rest of them. I just know I ought to have grandchildren somewhere in the country.\" \"Lizzie Belle and Clara has got a raft of children, I reckon. They was always talking about having them. And they say over in Fuller that Lizzie Belle has got a lot of them. I don\u0027t know how other folks know more about such things than I do. Looks like I ought to be the one who knows the most about my children.\" \"Maybe you could get Tom to bring his children over here for me to see. You tell him I want to see my grandchildren, and maybe he\u0027ll consent to bring them.\" Ada had talked several times about Tom bringing his children to see her. Every time Jeeter said anything about going over to Burke County where Tom\u0027s cross-tie camp was, she reminded him not to forget to tell Tom what she had said. But from year to year, as Jeeter failed to start, she had become less inclined to talk about the possibility of seeing any of the grandchildren. Jeeter could not get started. He would say he was going the next day, but he always put off the trip at the last minute. Jeeter made a false start somewhere nearly every day. He was going to Fuller, or he was going to McCoy, or he was going to Augusta; but he never went when he said he would. If he told Ada at night that he was going to McCoy early the next morning, he would decide at the last minute to go to Fuller or Augusta instead. Usually he would have to stop or walk out over the old cotton fields and look at the tall brown broom-sedge, and that made him think about something else. When he did walk out into the sedge, the chances were that he would lie down and take a nap. It was a wonder how he ever got the wood cut that he hauled to Augusta. Sometimes it took him a whole week to cut enough blackjack for a load. Just then it was the beginning of the new season that was causing him to change his mind so frequently. The smell of the burning broom-sedge and pine undergrowth was in the air every day now. Some of the land was even being broken away off in the distance, and he could detect the aroma of freshly turned earth miles away. The smell of newly turned earth, that others were never conscious of, reached Jeeter\u0027s nostrils with a more pungent odor than any one else could ever detect in the air. That made him want to go out right away and burn over the old cotton fields and plant a crop. Other men were doing that all around him, but even if he succeeded in borrowing a mule, Jeeter did not know where to begin begging for credit to buy seed-cotton and guano. The merchants in Fuller had heard his plea so many times that they knew what he was going to ask for as soon as he walked in the door, and before he could say the first word they were shaking their heads and going back where he could not follow them. He did not know what to do about it. Jeeter postponed nearly everything a man could think of, but when it came to plowing the land and planting cotton, he was as persistent as any man could be about such things. He started out each day with his enthusiasm at fever pitch, and by night he was still as determined as ever to find a mule he could borrow and a merchant who would give him credit for seed-cotton and guano. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842/53372.html","bookId":999,"book":{"id":999,"title":"Tobacco Road 烟草路","description":"简介： 《烟草路》以喜剧性夸张手法来描写悲剧，夸大人物的古怪性格和荒唐行为，突出人物同环境之间的格格不入以及他的悲惨结局，是一部用幽默笔调表现当时美国南方生活的贫穷、愚昧、落后的杰作。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/25/10-39-17-45-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
