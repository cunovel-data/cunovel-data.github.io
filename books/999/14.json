{"id":24496,"no":14,"title":"Chapter Fourteen","content":"Dude and Sister Bessie came back at sunset. Dude was blowing the horn a mile away, when Jeeter first heard it, and he and Ada ran out to the road to watch them come. The horn made a pretty sound, Jeeter thought, and he liked the way Dude blew it. He was pressing the horn button and taking his finger off every few seconds, like the firemen who blew the engine whistles when they were leaving the coal chute. \"That\u0027s Dude blowing the horn,\" Jeeter said. \"Don\u0027t he blow it pretty, though? He always liked to blow the horn near about as much as he liked to drive an automobile. He used to cuss a lot because the horn on my car wouldn\u0027t make the least bit of a sound. The wires got pulled loose and I never had time to tie them up again.\" Ada stood in the road watching the shiny new car come nearer and nearer. It looked like a big black chariot, she said, running away from a cyclone. The dust blown up behind did look like the approach of a cyclone. \"Ain\u0027t that the prettiest sight to see?\" she said. \"That\u0027s Dude driving it, and blowing the horn, too,\" he said. \"It makes a pretty sound when it blows, don\u0027t it, Ada?\" Jeeter was proud of his son. \"I wish all my children was here to see it,\" Ada said. \"Lizzie Belle used to like to look at automobiles, and ride in them, too, more than anybody I ever saw. Maybe she\u0027s got herself one now. I wish I knowed.\" Sister Bessie and Dude drove up slowly, and turned into the yard. Jeeter and Ada ran along beside the car until it stopped beside the chimney of the house. Ellie May saw everything from around the corner of the house. \"How far a piece did you go riding?\" Jeeter asked Bessie as she opened the door and stepped out on the ground. \"You been gone clear the whole afternoon. Did you go to Augusta?\" Bessie caught up the bottom of her skirt and began wiping off the dust. Ada and Ellie May were already at work on the other side of the car. The grandmother was thirty feet away, standing behind a chinaberry tree and looking around the trunk at the automobile. Dude sat un der the steering-wheel blowing the horn. \"We went and we went till we went clear to McCoy,\" she said. \"We just kept on going till we got there.\" \"That\u0027s about thirty miles, ain\u0027t it?\" Jeeter -asked excitedly. \"Did you go clear that far and back?\" \"That\u0027s what we did,\" Dude said. \"I ain\u0027t never been that far away from here before. It\u0027s a pretty country down that way, too.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you go to Augusta?\" Jeeter asked. \"You went down to the crossroads and I thought sure you was going to Augusta.\" \"We didn\u0027t go that way,\" Dude said, \"we went the other way--toward McCoy. And we went clear to McCoy, too.\" Jeeter walked to the front of the car and looked at it. Dude climbed out and stopped blowing the horn for a while. \"Praise the Lord,\" Jeeter said, \"what went and done that?\" He pointed to the right front fender and headlight. Everybody stopped dusting and gathered around the radiator. The fender was twisted and crumpled until it looked as if somebody had taken a sledge-hammer and tried to see how completely he could maul it. The right headlight had been knocked off. Only a piece of twisted iron and a small strand of insulated wire remained where it had been. The fender had been mashed back against the hood. \"It was a wagon that done that,\" Dude said. \"We was coming back from McCoy, and I was looking out at a big turpentine still, and then the first thing I knowed we was smashed smack into the back of a two-horse wagon.\" Bessie looked at the mashed fender and missing headlight, but she said nothing. She could hardly blame it on the devil this time, as she had been riding in the car herself when the accident occurred, but it seemed to her that God ought to have taken better care of it, especially after she had stopped and prayed about it when she bought the automobile that morning in Fuller. \"It don\u0027t hurt the running of it none, though, does it?\" Jeeter asked. \"It runs like it was brand new yet,\" Dude said. \"And the horn wasn\u0027t hurt none at all. It blows just as pretty as it did this morning.\" The fender had been crumpled beyond repair. It was lying against the hood of the car and, except for the jagged edges, it appeared as if it had been removed. Apparently nothing else, with the exception of the headlight, had been damaged; there were no dents in the body, and the wheels and axle seemed to stand straight and in line. The broken spring made the left rear end sag, however. \"That don\u0027t hurt it none,\" Jeeter said. \"Don\u0027t pay no attention to it, Bessie. Just leave it be, and you\u0027ll never know it was any different than it was when you got it brand new.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" she said. \"I ain\u0027t letting it worry me none, because it wasn\u0027t Dude\u0027s fault. He was looking at the big turpentine still alongside the road, and I was too, when the wagon got in our way. The nigger driving it ought to have had enough sense to get out of our way when he heard us coming.\" \"Wasn\u0027t you blowing the horn then, Dude?\" Jeeter said. \"Not right then I wasn\u0027t, because I was looking at the big still. I never saw one that big nowhere before. It was almost as big as a corn-liquor still, only it wasn\u0027t as shiny-looking.\" \"It\u0027s a shame to get the new car smashed up so soon already, though,\" Bessie said, going back and wiping off the dust. \"It was brand new only a short time before noon, and now it\u0027s only sun-down.\" \"It was that nigger,\" Dude said. \"If he hadn\u0027t been asleep on the wagon it wouldn\u0027t have happened at all. He was plumb asleep till it woke him up and threw him out in the ditch.\" \"He didn\u0027t get hurt much, did he?\" Jeeter asked. \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" Dude said. \"When we drove off again, he was still lying in the ditch. The wagon turned over on him and mashed him. His eyes was wide open all the time, but I couldn\u0027t make him say nothing. He looked like he was dead.\" -\"Niggers will get killed. Looks like there ain\u0027t no way to stop it.\" The sun had been down nearly a half an hour and the chill dampness of an early spring night settled over the ground. The grandmother had already gone into the house and got into bed. Ada went up on the porch, hugging her arms across her chest to keep warm, and Bessie started inside, too. Dude and Jeeter stood around the car until it was so dark they could not see it any longer, and then they too went inside. The glare of woods-fire soon began to light the sky on the horizons, and the smell of pine smoke filled the damp evening air. Fires were burning in all directions; some of them had been burning a week or longer, while others had been burning only since that afternoon. In the springy the farmers burned over all of their land. They said the fire would kill the boll-weevils. That was the reason they gave for burning the woods and fields, whenever anybody asked why they did not stop burning up young pine seedlings and standing timber. But the real reason was because everybody had always burned the woods and fields each spring, and they saw no cause for abandoning life-long habits. Burning fields and woods seemed to them to be as necessary as drilling guano in the cotton fields to make the plants yield a large crop. If the wood that was burned had been sawn into lumber or cut into firewood, instead of burning to ashes on the ground, there would have been something for them to sell. Boll weevils were never killed in any great numbers by the fire; the cotton plants had to be sprayed with poison in the summer, anyway. But everybody had always burned over the land each spring, and they continued if only for the reason that their fathers had done it. Jeeter always burned over his land, even though there was no reason in the world why he should do it; he never raised crops any more. This was why the land was bare of everything except broom-sedge and blackjack; the sedge grew anew each year, and the hottest fire could not hurt those tough scrub oaks. Inside the house the women gathered in the bedroom in the darkness and waited for Jeeter and Dude. The grandmother was already in bed, covered with her ragged quilts. Ellie May had gone out into the broom-sedge and had not yet returned. Bessie and Ada sat on the beds waiting. The three beds had always held all the Lester\u0027s, even when there were sometimes as many as eight or nine of them there. Occasionally, some had slept on pallets on the floor in summer, but in winter it was much warmer for every one in the beds. Now that all of the children had left except Dude and Ellie May, there was just enough room for every one. Bessie had a house of her own, a three-room tenant house on the last sand hill at the river; but the roof was rotten, and the shingles had blown away, and when it rained everything in the three rooms was soaked with water. Sometimes in the middle of the night when a storm came up suddenly, Bessie would wake up to find the bed filled with water, every piece of her clothes wet, and more water pouring down through the roof. She had told Ada that she did not want to stay there any more until she could have a new shingle roof put on the house. The building and the land around it belonged to Captain John Harmon; he never came out to the tobacco road any more, and he made no repairs to the buildings. He had told Jeeter and Bessie, and all the other people who lived out there, that they could stay in the houses until the buildings rotted to the ground and that he would never ask for a penny of rent. They understood the arrangement fully; he was not going to make any repairs to the roofs, porches, rotted undersills, or anything about the buildings. If the houses fell down, he said, it would be too bad for them; but if they stood up, then Jeeter, Bessie, and all the others could remain in them as long as they wanted to stay. Jeeter and Dude came into the house, stumbling through the darkness. There was a lamp in the house, but no kerosene had been bought that whole winter. The Lester\u0027s went to bed at dark, except in summer when it was warm enough to sit on the porch, and they got up at daylight. There was no need for kerosene, anyway. Jeeter sat down on his bed beside Ada and pulled off his heavy shoes. The brogans fell on the floor like bricks dropped waist high. \"We stopped in every house we came to, and got out and visited a while,\" Bessie said. \"Some of them wanted prayer, and some didn\u0027t. It didn\u0027t make much difference to me, because me and Dude was all excited about riding around. Some of the people wanted to know where I got all the money to buy a brand-new car, and why I married Dude, and I told them. I told them my former husband left me eight hundred dollars, and I said I married Dude because I was going to make a preacher out of him. Of course, that was only one reason why we got married, but I knew that would be enough to tell them.\" \"Nobody said things against you, did they, Sister Bessie?\" Jeeter asked. \"Some people has got a way of talking about people like us.\" \"Well, some of them did say a few things about me marrying Dude. They said he was too young to be married to a woman my age, but when they started talking like that, we just got in our new automobile and rode off. A lot of them said it was a sin and a shame for to take my husband\u0027s money and buy an automobile and get married to a young boy like Dude, but while they was doing the talking, me and Dude was doing the riding, wasn\u0027t we, Dude?\" Dude did not answer. \"I reckon Dude has gone to sleep,\" Jeeter said. \"He worked pretty hard to-day, driving that automobile clear to McCoy and back again.\" Ada sat up in bed. \"Take them overalls off, Jeeter,\" she said angrily. \"I ain\u0027t never seen the like of it. You know I ain\u0027t going to let you sleep in the bed with them dirty pants on. I have to tell you about it nearly every time. They dirty-up the bed something bad. You ought to know I ain\u0027t going to stand for that.\" \"It\u0027s pretty cold again to-night,\" Jeeter said. \"I get chilly when I don\u0027t sleep with my overalls on. It seems like I can\u0027t do nothing no more like I want to. Sleeping in overalls ain\u0027t going to hurt nothing, noway.\" \"You\u0027re the only man I ever knowed of who wanted to sleep in his overalls. Don\u0027t nobody else do like that.\" Jeeter did not answer her. He got up out of bed and climbed out of his overalls and hung them on the foot of the bed. When he got back under the quilts, he was shivering all over. Bessie could be heard over the other side of the room stepping around in her stockinged feet getting ready for bed. She had kept her shoes on until she removed her clothes. Jeeter lifted his head from under the cover and tried to look through the darkness of the room. \"You know, Bessie,\" he said, \"it sort of makes me feel good like I was before I lost my health to have a woman preacher sleep in my house. It\u0027s a fine feeling I has about you staying here.\" \"I\u0027m a woman preacher, all right,\" she said, \"but I ain\u0027t no different in other ways from the rest of the women folks. Jeeter, you know that, don\u0027t you?\" Jeeter raised himself on his elbow and strained his eyes to see through the darkness across the room. \"I hope you ain\u0027t leaving us no time soon,\" he said. \"I\u0027d be powerful pleased to have you sleep here all the time, Bessie.\" Ada thrust her elbow into his ribs with all her strength, and he fell down groaning with pain on the bed beside her. Bessie could be heard getting into her bed. The cornshuck mattress crackled, and the slats rattled as she lay down and stretched out her feet. She lay still for several minutes, and then she began to stretch her hands out towards the other side, the impact of her arms making the shucks crackle more than ever. Suddenly she sat up in bed, throwing the quilts aside. \"Where\u0027s Dude?\" she demanded angrily, her voice gruff and unnatural. \"Where is you, Dude?\" Not a sound was to be heard in the room. Ada had sat upright, and Jeeter had sprung to a sitting position on the side of the bed. Bessie\u0027s corn-shuck mattress crackled some more, and then the thump of her bare feet on the pine floor could be heard all over the house. Jeeter still did not attempt to speak or to move. He waited to catch every sound in the house. \"You Dude--you Dude!\" Bessie cried from the centre of the room, trying to feel her way from bed to bed. \"Where is you, Dude--why don\u0027t you answer me? You\u0027d better not try to hide from me, Dude!\" \"What\u0027s the matter, Bessie?\" Jeeter said. \"Dude ain\u0027t in the bed--I can\u0027t find him nowhere at all.\" Reaching for his overalls, Jeeter jumped to his feet. He began fumbling in his pockets for a match. At last he found one, and bending over, he struck it on the floor. The flare of the match revealed every one in the room. Every one was there except Ellie May and Dude. Bessie was only a few feet away from Jeeter, and he tried to look at her. She was shielding her eyes from the light. Ada crawled out of bed and stood behind Jeeter the moment she saw Bessie. \"Put them overalls on,\" she commanded Jeeter. \"I don\u0027t know what you and her is up to, but I\u0027m watching. You put them overalls on right now. I don\u0027t care if she is a woman preacher, she ain\u0027t got no right to stand on the floor in front of you like she is.\" Jeeter hesitated, and the match burned down to his fingers. He stepped into his overalls, put one arm through a gallus, and reached into his pocket for another match. Bessie was still standing beside Jeeter, but when he struck the match, she ran to Mother Lester\u0027s bed. She jerked back the covers, and she saw Dude sound asleep. The grandmother was awake, and she lay trembling in her old torn black clothes. Jeeter shook Dude awake and pulled him to the floor. Ada jerked him by the arm. \"What you mean by not getting in bed with Bessie?\" Jeeter demanded, shaking him roughly by the collar. Dude looked around him and blinked his eyes. He was unable to see anything in the glare of the match. \"What you want?\" he asked, rubbing his eyes. \"Dude, he didn\u0027t know which bed to get in,\" Sister Bessie said tenderly. \"He was so tired and sleepy he didn\u0027t look to see which one we was goin\u0027 to sleep in, did you, Dude?\" \"Dude, you can\u0027t act that way,\" Jeeter said. \"You got to keep your eyes open when you get married. Bessie, here, got powerful nervous when she didn\u0027t find you in bed.\" Ada went back to bed, and Jeeter followed her. He did not take off his overalls, and Ada went to sleep without thinking about them. Ellie May came in after a while and got into bed with her grandmother. No one spoke to her. The grandmother had been wide awake all the time, but no one said anything to her, and she did not try to tell Bessie that Dude was in her bed. No one ever said any. thing to her, except to tell her to get out of the way, or to stop eating the bread and meat. Dude and Bessie went to their bed and lay down. Sister Bessie tried to talk to Dude, but Dude was tired and sleepy. He did not answer her. The rustling sound of the corn-shuck mattress continued most of the night.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842/53378.html","bookId":999,"book":{"id":999,"title":"Tobacco Road 烟草路","description":"简介： 《烟草路》以喜剧性夸张手法来描写悲剧，夸大人物的古怪性格和荒唐行为，突出人物同环境之间的格格不入以及他的悲惨结局，是一部用幽默笔调表现当时美国南方生活的贫穷、愚昧、落后的杰作。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/25/10-39-17-45-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
