{"id":24491,"no":9,"title":"Chapter Nine","content":"The sun had been up only half an hour when Bessie reached the Lester house on the morning after her sudden departure. She had said then that she was going home to ask God to let her marry Dude. Jeeter had not expected her to come back for several days. No one was in sight as she crossed the yard and ran through the front door calling Dude. \"Dude--you Dude! Where is you, Dude?\" she called. Jeeter was just getting out of bed when he first heard her; she ran into the bedroom while he sat on a chair pulling on his shoes. \"What you want with Dude, Bessie?\" he asked sleepily. \"What do you want Dude for?\" Bessie ran around the room looking into the beds. There were three beds in which all the Lester\u0027s slept. Ada and Jeeter used one of them, Ellie May and the grandmother another, and Dude slept alone. Ellie May sat up in bed, awakened by the disturbance, and rubbed her eyes. Bessie jerked back the quilts on Dude\u0027s bed, and ran into the next room where the roof had fallen in. It was the other bedroom, the room where most of the children had formerly slept, and it had been deserted because one section of the roof had rotted away. It was filled with plunder. Bessie came back and looked under Ada\u0027s bed. \"What did you want with Dude this time of day, Bessie?\" Jeeter asked. She still did not stop to answer Jeeter\u0027s questions. She ran through the kitchen calling Dude at the top of her voice. As soon as he could lace his shoes and put on his jumper, Jeeter followed her out into the backyard. His drooping black felt hat was on his head, because his hat was the first thing he put on in the morning and the last he took off at night. Dude was drawing a bucket of water at the well, and Bessie reached him before he could tip the bucket and get a drink. She threw her arms around his neck and kissed his face excitedly. Dude fought back at first, but as soon as he saw it was Bessie he smiled at her and put his arms around her waist. Jeeter went closer and watched them. Presently Bessie took a side-comb from her head and began combing Dude\u0027s stiff black hair and smoothing it down with the palms of her hands. Dude\u0027s hair was coarse and bristly, and it stood straight on its ends no matter how much it was combed and brushed. Sometimes he could manage to make it lie down for a few minutes by sousing his head in a pan of water and then combing it hurriedly; but as soon as the water began to dry, the hair would stand straight up again as if it were attached to springs. Dude\u0027s hair was as wiry as hog-bristles. \"I never seen a woman preacher carry-on over a young sapling like that before,\" Jeeter said. \"What you want to do that to Dude for, Bessie? You and him is hugging and rubbing of the other just like you was yesterday on the front porch. Bessie smiled at Dude and Jeeter. She leaned against the well-stand and tucked up her hair. She had not waited that morning to pin it up. \"Me and Dude is going to get married,\" she said. \"The Lord told me to do it. I asked Him about it, and He said, \u0027Sister Bessie, Dude Lester is the man I want you to mate. Get up early in the morning and go up to the Lester place and marry Dude the first thing.\u0027 That\u0027s what He said to me last night, the very words I heard with my own ears while I was praying about it in bed. So when the sun came up, I got out of bed and ran up here as fast as I could, because the Lord don\u0027t like to be kept waiting for His plans to be carried out. He wants me to marry Dude right now.\" Dude looked around nervously as if he was thinking of trying to run off to the woods and hide. He had forgotten how anxious he had been to go home with Bessie the evening before when she first mentioned marriage. \"You hear that, Dude?\" Jeeter said. \"What you think about doing it with \u0027Sister Bessie?\" \"Shucks,\" he said. \"I couldn\u0027t do that.\" \"Why can\u0027t you do that?\" Jeeter demanded. \"What\u0027s ailing you? Ain\u0027t you man enough yet?\" \"Maybe I is, and maybe I ain\u0027t. I\u0027d be scared to do that with her.\" \"Why Dude,\" his father said, \"that ain\u0027t nothing to be afraid about. Bessie ain\u0027t going to hurt you. She knows how to treat you. Sister Bessie, there, has been married before. She\u0027s a widow-woman now. She knows all about how to treat men.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t hurt you none, Dude,\" she said, putting her arm around his neck and drawing his arms tighter around her waist. \"There ain\u0027t nothing to be scared of. I\u0027m just like your sister, Ellie May, and your Ma. Women don\u0027t scare their menfolk\u0027s none. You\u0027ll like being married to me, because I know how to treat men fine.\" Ada elbowed her way past Jeeter and Dude. She had not waited to plait her hair when she heard what Bessie wanted. She stood beside Dude and Bessie, with her hair divided over the front of her shoulders, plaiting one side and tying a string around the end, and then beginning on the other braid. She was as excited as Bessie was. \"Bessie,\" she said, \"you\u0027ll have to make Dude wash his feet every once in a while, because if you don\u0027t he\u0027ll dirty-up your quilts. Sometimes he don\u0027t wash himself all winter long, and the quilts get that dirty you don\u0027t know how to go about the cleaning of them. Dude is just careless like his Paw. I had the hardest time learning him to wear his socks in the bed, because it was the only way I could keep the quilts clean. He would never wash himself. I reckon Dude is just going on the same way his Pa done, so maybe you had better make Dude wear his socks, too.\" Ellie May had come out of the house and was standing behind the chinaberry tree in order to hear and see what was taking place beside the well-stand. The grandmother was in the yard too; she was peering from behind the corner of the house lest any one should see her and make her go away. \"Maybe you and Dude will help me get a stylish dress,\" Ada suggested shyly. \"You and him know how bad I want a dress of the right length to die in. I\u0027ve long ago give up waiting for Jeeter to get me one. He ain\u0027t going to do it in time.\" All of them stood by the well looking at each other. When Jeeter caught Dude\u0027s eye, Dude hung his head and looked at the ground. He did not know what to think about it. He wanted to get married, but he was afraid of Bessie. She was nearly twenty-five years older than he was. \"Do you know what I\u0027m going to do, Jeeter?\" Bessie asked. \"What?\" Jeeter said. \"I\u0027m going to buy me a new automobile!\" \"A new automobile?\" \"A brand-new one. I\u0027m going to Fuller right now and get it.\" \"A brand-new one?\" Jeeter said unbelievingly. \"A sure-enough brand-new automobile?\" Dude\u0027s mouth dropped open, and his eyes glistened. \"What you going to buy it with, Bessie?\" Jeeter asked. \"Is you got money?\" \"I\u0027ve got eight hundred dollars to pay for it with. My former husband left me that money when he died. He had it in insurance, and when he died I got it and put it in the bank in Augusta. I aimed to use it in carrying on the prayer and preaching my former husband used to like so much. I always did want a brand-new automobile.\" \"When you going to buy a new automobile?\" Jeeter asked. \"Right now--to-day. I\u0027m going over to Fuller and get it right now. Me and Dude\u0027s going to use it to travel all over the country preaching and praying.\" \"Can I drive it?\" Dude asked. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m buying it for, Dude. I\u0027m getting it for you to drive us around in when we take a notion to go somewheres.\" \"When is you and Dude going to do all this riding around and praying and preaching?\" Jeeter said. \"Is you going to get married before or after?\" \"Right away,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll walk over to Fuller right now and buy the new automobile, and then ride up to the courthouse and get married.\" \"Is you going to get leave of the county to get married?\" he asked doubtfully. \"Or is you just going to live along without it?\" \"I\u0027m going to get the license for marrying,\" she said. \"That costs about two dollars,\" Jeeter reminded. \"Is you got two dollars?\u0027 Dude ain\u0027t. Dude, he ain\u0027t got nothing.\" \"I ain\u0027t asking Dude for one penny of money. I\u0027ll attend to that part myself. I\u0027ve got eight hundred dollars in the bank and some more besides. I saved my money for something just like this to happen. I\u0027ve been looking for it to happen all along.\" Dude had been dropping pebbles into the well for the past few minutes. Suddenly he stopped and looked at Bessie. He looked straight into her face, and the sight of the two cavernous round nostrils brought a smile to his lips. He had looked at her nose before, but this time the holes seemed to be larger and rounder than ever. It was more like looking into a double-barrel shotgun than ever before. He could not keep from laughing. \"What you laughing at, Dude?\" she asked, groaning. \"At them two holes in your nose,\" he said. \"I ain\u0027t never seen nobody with all the top of her nose gone away like that before.\" Bessie\u0027s face turned white. She hung her head in an effort to hide the exposed nostrils as much as possible. She was sensitive about her appearance, but she knew of no way to remedy her nose. She had been born without a bone in it, and after nearly forty years it had still not developed. She put her hand over her face. \"I\u0027m ashamed of you, Dude,\" she said, wiping the tears from the corners of her eyes. \"You know I can\u0027t help the way I look. I been like that ever since I can remember. Won\u0027t no nose grow on me, I reckon.\" Dude dug the toes of his shoes in the sand and tried to laugh. But almost as suddenly as he had first looked at Bessie\u0027s face and broken into a smile, he stopped and scowled meanly at himself. It was the remembrance of the new automobile that made him stop laughing at Bessie. If she was going to buy a brand-new car, he did not care how she looked. It would have been all right with him if she had had a harelip like Ellie May\u0027s, now that he could ride all he wanted to. He had never driven a new motor car, and that was something he wanted to do more than anything else he could think of. \"I didn\u0027t mean no harm,\" he said uneasily. \"Honest to God, I didn\u0027t. I don\u0027t give a damn how your nose looks.\" Bessie smiled again, and put her arms around his waist. She looked up at him again, her face so close to his that he could feel her breath. He had to stop trying to see down into her nose, because it hurt his eyes, and made them ache, to focus them on an object only a few inches away. Her nostrils were only a dark blur on her face when they were standing so close together. \"Can I drive the new automobile, sure enough?\" he asked again, hoping he had not made her change her mind. \"Is you going to let me drive it?\" \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m getting it, Dude. I\u0027m getting it for you to drive all over the country in. Me and you is going to get married, and we can ride all the time if we want to. I won\u0027t stop you from going somewhere when you want to go. You can ride all the time.\" \"Will it have a horn on it?\" \"I reckon it will. Don\u0027t all new automobiles come with horns already on them?\" \"Maybe so,\" he said. \"You be sure and find out if it\u0027s got one when you buy it, anyway. It won\u0027t be no good at all unless it\u0027s got a horn.\" \"Dude is pretty durn lucky,\" Jeeter said. \"I didn\u0027t get a durn thing when I married Ada. She didn\u0027t have nothing but some old dresses of her own, and her people was that durn poor they had to eat meal and fatback just like we do now. I didn\u0027t get nothing when I married her, except a mess of trouble.\" Ada walked over to Bessie and laid her hand on Bessie\u0027s arm. \"Maybe if you got all that money Bessie, you and Dude could buy me a jar of snuff in Fuller. Reckon you could do that for Dude\u0027s old Ma? Being that Dude is my boy, you ought to get me just a little jar of snuff, anyway. I\u0027d sure be powerful pleased if you was to get three or four jars while you was about it, though. Snuff drives away the pains in my poor stomach when I can\u0027t get nothing to eat.\" \"I been needing a new pair of overalls for the longest time, Bessie,\" Jeeter said. \"I declare, I\u0027m almost scared to go a far piece from the house any more, because I don\u0027t know but what my clothes will drop right off of me some time when I ain\u0027t noticing. If you could get me a new pair in Fuller, I\u0027d be powerful pleased.\" Bessie led Dude away from the well. They walked around the house, and when nobody was looking, she stood behind him and hugged him so hard he could not breathe until she released him. \"What you doing that to me for?\" he said. \"I ain\u0027t never had that done to me before.\" \"Me and you is going to get married, Dude. Don\u0027t you know that?\" He walked around behind her, looked at the back of her head, and came back in front again. \"When is you going to get a new automobile?\" he asked. \"Right away, Dude. We\u0027re going to Fuller right now and get it.\" Dude was more excited over the prospect of driving a new automobile than he had ever been about anything in his whole life. The automobiles he had seen had all been old ones like Jeeter\u0027s, except the ones the rich people in Augusta drove. He could not make himself believe that he was actually going to drive one like those he had seen in the city. He wanted to start for Fuller without another minute\u0027s delay. \"Come on,\" he said. \"We ain\u0027t got no time to lose.\" \"Ain\u0027t you glad we is going to get married, though?\" she said. \"It\u0027s going to be real nice, ain\u0027t it, Dude?\" The rest of the Lester\u0027s had followed them to the front yard, and they stood by the corner of the house waiting to see Dude and Bessie leave for Fuller. Ellie May followed them down the road for about half a mile before she turned around and came back to the house. Dude walked in front, and Bessie followed him several yards behind. When they reached the top of the first sand hill, they stopped and looked back at the Lester house to see if Ada and Jeeter were watching them. Bessie waved her hand until Dude told her to hurry up so they could get to Fuller. The long walk to Fuller took them nearly two hours, because Bessie had to stop several times and rest beside the road. The sun was hot by that time, as it was nearly ten o\u0027clock when they left the Lester place; and it was difficult walking through the deep sand, especially for Bessie. In some places the sand was a foot deep, and her feet sank down so far that the sand ran down her shoe tops. Dude would never sit down and wait for Bessie to get ready to start walking again. He waited several feet away, urging her to hurry. Dude had started out walking slowly enough for Bessie to keep up with him; but as they got closer to Fuller, Dude could not hold himself back. He ran ahead several hundred yards, and then had to walk back to meet Bessie. He would have gone on to town without her, but he did not know what to do when he got there. He was afraid, too, that if he got out of Bessie\u0027s sight she might turn around and go back without buying the new automobile. Neither of them talked the whole time. Bessie hummed a hymn to herself, occasionally raising a note to the shrill pitch she liked so much, but she did not try to talk to Dude. They were too engrossed in their own thoughts to talk. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842/53373.html","bookId":999,"book":{"id":999,"title":"Tobacco Road 烟草路","description":"简介： 《烟草路》以喜剧性夸张手法来描写悲剧，夸大人物的古怪性格和荒唐行为，突出人物同环境之间的格格不入以及他的悲惨结局，是一部用幽默笔调表现当时美国南方生活的贫穷、愚昧、落后的杰作。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/25/10-39-17-45-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
