{"id":24484,"no":2,"title":"Chapter Two","content":"Lov opened the sack, selected a large turnip, wiping it clean with his hands, and took three bites one after the other. The Lester women stood in the yard and on the porch looking at Lov eat. Ellie May came from behind the chinaberry tree and sat down not far from Lov on a pine stump. Ada and the old grandmother were on the porch watching the turnip in Lov\u0027s hand become smaller and smaller with each bite. \"Now, if Pearl was anything like Ellie May, she wouldn\u0027t act like she does,\" Lov said. \"I\u0027d have taken Ellie May at the start if it wasn\u0027t for that face of hers. But I knowed I couldn\u0027t sleep with no peace of mind at night with her in the bed with me, and knowing how it looked in the daylight. Pearl looks pretty, and she\u0027s a right smart piece to want to sleep with, but I just can\u0027t make her stay off of that durn pallet on the floor when night comes. You got to come down there and make her do like she ought to act, Jeeter. I been married to her near on to a whole year, and all that time I could just as well been shovelling coal at the chute night and day without ever going to my house. That ain\u0027t the way it was intended for it to be. A man has a right to want his wife to get in the bed when dark comes. I ain\u0027t never heard of a woman wanting to sleep on a durn pallet on the floor every night in the whole year. Pearl is queer that way.\" \"By God and by Jesus, Dude,\" Jeeter said, \"ain\u0027t you never going to stop bouncing that there ball against that there old house? You\u0027ve clear about got all the weatherboards knocked off already. The durned old house is going to pitch over and fall to the ground some of these days if you don\u0027t stop doing that.\" Jeeter picked up the inner-tube again, and tried to make the patch stick to the rubber. The old automobile against which he was sitting was the last of his possessions. The year before, the cow had died, leaving him with the car. Up until that time he had had a way of boasting about his goods, but when the cow went, he did not even mention the car any more. He had begun to think that he was indeed a poor man. No longer was there anything. he could mortgage when the time came each spring to buy seed-cotton and guano; the automobile had been turned down at the junk yard in Augusta. But he still had wood to sell; it was the wiry blackjack that grew behind the house. He was trying now to patch the inner tube so he could haul a load of it to Augusta some time that week. Ada said all the meal was gone, and the meat, too. They had been living off of fat-back rinds several days already, and after they were gone, there would be nothing for them to eat. A load of blackjack would bring fifty or seventy-five cents in Augusta, if he could find a man who would buy it. When the old cow had died, Jeeter hauled the carcass to the fertilizer plant in Augusta and received two dollars and a quarter for it. After that, there was nothing left to sell but blackjack. \"Quit chunking that durn ball at them there weatherboards, Dude,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t never stop doing what I tell you. That ain\u0027t no way to treat your old Pa, Dude. You ought to sort of help me out, instead of always doing something contrary.\" \"Aw, go to hell, you old dried-up clod,\" Dude said, throwing the ball at the side of the house with all his might and scooping up a fast grounder on the rebound. \"Nobody asked you nothing .\" The old grandmother, Jeeter\u0027s mother, crawled under the front porch for the old burlap sack, and went across the tobacco road towards the grove for some dead twigs. No one paid any attention to her. Wood for the kitchen stove and fireplace was never cut and hauled to the house; Jeeter would not do it, and he could not make Dude do that kind of work. Old Mother Lester knew there was no food for them to cook, and that it would be a waste of time for her to go after dead twigs and make a fire in the cook-stove; but she was hungry, and she was always hoping that God would provide for them if she made a fire in the kitchen at meal-time. Knowing that there were turnips in Lov\u0027s sack made her frantic with hunger. She could sometimes stand the pain of it in her stomach when she knew there was nothing to eat, but when Lov stood in full view taking turnips out of the sack, she could not bear the sight of seeing food no one would let her have. She hobbled across the road and over the old cotton field that had not been planted and cultivated in six or seven years. The field had grown up in broom-sedge at the start, and now the gnarled and sharp stubs of a new blackjack growth were beginning to cover the ground. She tripped and fell several times on her way to the grove of trees, and her clothes had been torn so many times before that the new tears in the skirt and jacket could not be distinguished from the older ones. The coat and shirt she wore had been torn into strips an: shreds by the briars and blackjack pricks in the thicket where she gathered up the dead twigs for firewood, and there never had been new clothes for her. Hobbling through the brown broomsedge, she looked like an old scarecrow, in her black rags. The February wind whistled through the strips of black cloth, whirling them about in the air until it looked as if she were shaking violently with palsy. Her stockings had been made by wrapping some of the longer of the black rags around her legs and tying the ends with knots. Her shoes were pieces of horse-collars cut into squares and tied around her feet with strings. She went after the dead twigs morning, noon, and night; when she returned to the house each time, she made a fire in the cook-stove and sat down to wait. Ada shifted the snuff stick to the other side of her mouth and looked longingly at Lov and his sack of turnips. She held the loose calico dress over her chest to keep out the cool February wind blowing under the roof of the porch. Everyone else was sitting or standing in the sunshine. Ellie May got down from the pine stump and sat on the ground. She moved closer and closer to Lov, sliding herself over the hard white sand. \"Is you in mind to make a trade with them turnips?\" Jeeter asked Lov, \"I\u0027m wanting turnips, God Himself only knows how bad.\" \"I ain\u0027t trading turnips to nobody,\" he said. \"Now, Lov, that ain\u0027t no way to talk. I ain\u0027t had a good turnip since a year ago this spring. All the turnips I\u0027ve et has got them damn-blasted green-gutted worms in them. I sure would like to have some good turnips right now. Wormy ones like mine was ain\u0027t fit for a human.\" \"Go over to Fuller and buy yourself some, then,\" he said, eating the last of his fourth turnip. \"I went over there to get mine.\" \"Now, Lov, ain\u0027t I always been good to you? That ain\u0027t no way for you to talk. You know I ain\u0027t got a penny to my name and no knowing where to get money. You got a good job and it pays you a heap of money. You ought to make a trade with me so I\u0027ll have something to eat and won\u0027t have to starve to death. You don\u0027t want to sit there and see me starve, do you, Lov?\" \"I don\u0027t make but a dollar a day at the chute. House rent takes up near about all of that, and eating, the rest of it.\" \"Makes no difference, Lov. I ain\u0027t got a penny to my name, and you is.\" \"I can\u0027t help that. The Lord looks at us with equal favor, they say. He gives me mine, and if you don\u0027t get yours, you better go talk to Him about it. It ain\u0027t none of my. troubles. I\u0027ve got plenty of my own to worry about. Pearl won\u0027t never--\" \"Ain\u0027t you never going to stop chunking that durn ball against the house, Dude?\" Jeeter shouted. \"That noise near about splits my poor head wide open.\" Dude slammed his baseball against the loose weatherboards with all his might. Pieces of splintered pine fell over the yard, and rotten chunks dropped to the ground beside the house. Dude threw the ball harder each time, it seemed, and several times the ball almost went through the thin walls of the house. \"Why don\u0027t you go somewheres and steal a sack of turnips?\" Dude said. \"You ain\u0027t fit for nothing else no more. You sit around here and cuss all the time about not having nothing to eat, and no turnips--why don\u0027t you go somewheres and steal yourself something? God ain\u0027t going to bring you nothing. He ain\u0027t going to drop no turnips down out of the sky. He ain\u0027t got no time to be wasted on fooling with you, if you wasn\u0027t so durn lazy you\u0027d do something instead of cuss about it all the time.\" \"My children all blame me because God sees fit to make me poverty-ridden, Lov,\" Jeeter said. \"They and Ma is all the time cussing me because we ain\u0027t got nothing to eat. I ain\u0027t had nothing to do with it. It ain\u0027t my fault that Captain John shut down on giving us rations and snuff. It\u0027s his fault, Lov. I worked all my life for Captain John. I worked harder than any four of his niggers in the fields; then the first thing I knowed, he came down here one morning and says he can\u0027t be letting me be getting no more rations and snuff at the store. After that he sells all the mules and goes up to Augusta to live. I can\u0027t make no money, because there ain\u0027t nobody wanting work done. Nobody is taking on share-croppers, neither. Ain\u0027t no kind of work I can find to do for hire. I can\u0027t even raise me a crop of my own, because I ain\u0027t got no mule in the first place, and besides that, won\u0027t nobody let me have seed-cotton and guano on credit. Now I can\u0027t get no snuff and rations, excepting once in a while when I haul a load of wood up to Augusta. Captain John told the merchants in Fuller not to let me have no more snuff and rations on his credit, and I don\u0027t know where to get nothing. I\u0027d raise a crop of my own on this land if I could get somebody to sign my guano-notes, but won\u0027t nobody do that for me, neither. That\u0027s what I\u0027m wanting to do powerful strong right now. When the winter goes, and when it gets to be time to burn off broom-sedge in the fields and underbrush in the thickets, I sort of want to cry, I reckon it is. The smell of that sedge-smoke this time of year near about drives me crazy. Then pretty soon all the other farmers start plowing. That\u0027s what gets under my skin the worse. When the smell of that new earth turning over behind the plows strikes me, I get all weak and shaky. It\u0027s in my blood-burning broom-sedge and plowing in the ground this time of year. I did it for near about fifty years, and my Pa and his Pa before him was the same kind of men. Us Lester\u0027s sure like to stir the earth and make plants grow in it. I can\u0027t move off to the cotton mills like the rest of them do. The land has got a powerful hold on me. \"This raft of women and children is all the time bellowing for snuff and rations, too. It don\u0027t make no difference that I ain\u0027t got nothing to buy it with--they want it just the same. I reckon, Lov, I\u0027ll just have to wait for the good Lord to provide. They tell me He takes care of His people, and I\u0027m waiting for Him to take some notice of me. I don\u0027t reckon there\u0027s another man between here and Augusta who\u0027s as bad off as I is. And down the other way, neither, between here and McCoy. It looks like everybody has got goods and credit excepting me. I don\u0027t know why that is, because I always give the good Lord His due. Him and me has always been fair and square with each other. It\u0027s time for Him to take some notice of the fix I\u0027m in. I don\u0027t know nothing else to do, except wait f or Him to take notice. It don\u0027t do me no good to try to beg snuff and rations, because ain\u0027t nobody going to give it to me. I\u0027ve tried all over this part of the country, but don\u0027t nobody pay no attention to my requests. They say they ain\u0027t got nothing neither, but I can\u0027t see how that is. It don\u0027t look like everybody ought to be poverty-ridden just because they live on the land instead of going to the mills. If I\u0027ve been a sinful man, I don\u0027t know what it is I\u0027ve done. I don\u0027t seem to remember anything I done powerful sinful. It didn\u0027t used to be like it is now, either. I can recall a short time back when all the merchants in Fuller was tickled to give me credit, and I always had plenty of money to spend then, too. Cotton was selling upwards of thirty cents a pound, and nobody came around to collect debts. Then all of a sudden the merchants in Fuller wouldn\u0027t let me have no more goods on time, and pretty soon the sheriff comes and takes away near about every durn piece of goods I possessed. He took every durn thing I had, except that old automobile and the cow. He said the cow wasn\u0027t no good, because she wouldn\u0027t take no freshening, and the automobile tires was all wore out. \"And now I can\u0027t get no credit, I can\u0027t hire out for pay, and nobody wants to take on share-croppers. If the good Lord don\u0027t start bringing me help pretty soon, it will be too late to help me with my troubles.\" Jeeter paused to see if Lov were listening. Lov had his head turned in another direction. He was looking at Ellie May now. She had at last got him to give her some attention. Ellie May was edging closer and closer to Lov. She was moving across the yard by raising her weight on her hands and feet and sliding herself over the hard white sand. She was smiling at Lov, and trying to make him take more notice of her. She could not wait any longer for him to come to her, so she was going to him. Her harelip was spread open across her upper teeth, making her mouth appear as though she had no upper lip at all. Men usually would have nothing to do with Ellie May; but she was eighteen now, and she was beginning to discover that it should be possible for her to get a man in spite of her appearance. \"Ellie May\u0027s acting like your old hound used to do when he got the itch,\" Dude said to Jeeter. \"Look at her scrape her bottom on the sand. That old hound used to make the same kind of sound Ellie May\u0027s making, too. It sounds just like a little pig squealing, don\u0027t it?\" \"By God and by Jesus, Lov, I want some good eating turnips,\" Jeeter said. \"I ain\u0027t et nothing all winter but meal and fat-back, and I\u0027m wanting turnips something powerful. All the ones I raised has got them damn-blasted green-gutted worms in them. Where\u0027d you get them turnips at anyway, Lov? Maybe we could make a trade of some kind or another. I always treated you fair and square. You ought to give them to me, seeing as I ain\u0027t got none. I\u0027ll go down to your house the first thing in the morning and tell Pearl she\u0027s got to stop acting like she does. It\u0027s a durn shame for a gal to do the way she\u0027s treating you--I\u0027ll tell her she\u0027s got to let you have your rights with her. I never heard of a durn gal sleeping on a pallet on the floor when her husband has got a bed for her, nohow. Pearl won\u0027t keep that up after I tell her about it. That ain\u0027t no way to treat a man when he\u0027s gone to the bother of marrying. It\u0027s time she was knowing it, too. I\u0027ll go down there the first thing in the morning and tell her to get in the bed.\" Lov was paying no attention to Jeeter now. He was watching Ellie May slide across the yard towards him. When she came a little closer, he reached in the sack and took out another turnip, and began taking big bites out of it. He did not bother to wipe the sand from it this time. Ada shifted the snuff stick to the other side of her mouth again, and watched Ellie May and Lov with gaping jaw. Dude stood watching Ellie May too. \"Ellie May\u0027s going to get herself full of sand if she don\u0027t stop doing that,\" Dude said. \"Your old hound used never to keep it up that long at a time. He didn\u0027t squeal all the time neither, like she\u0027s doing.\" \"By God and Jesus, Lov,\" Jeeter said, \"I\u0027m wanting turnips. I could come near about chewing up a whole croker sank between now and bedtime to-night\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842/53366.html","bookId":999,"book":{"id":999,"title":"Tobacco Road 烟草路","description":"简介： 《烟草路》以喜剧性夸张手法来描写悲剧，夸大人物的古怪性格和荒唐行为，突出人物同环境之间的格格不入以及他的悲惨结局，是一部用幽默笔调表现当时美国南方生活的贫穷、愚昧、落后的杰作。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/25/10-39-17-45-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
