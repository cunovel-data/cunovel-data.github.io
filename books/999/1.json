{"id":24483,"no":1,"title":"Chapter One","content":"Lov Bensey trudged homeward through the deep white sand of the gully-washed tobacco road with a sack of winter turnips on his back. He had put himself to a lot of trouble to get the turnips; it was a long and tiresome walk all the way to Fuller and back again. The day before, Lov had heard that a man over there was selling winter turnips for fifty cents a bushel, so he had started out with half a dollar that morning to buy some. He had already walked seven and a half miles, and it was a mile and a half yet back to his house at the coal chute. Four or five of the Lester\u0027s were standing in the yard looking at Lov when he put his sack down and stopped in front of the house. They had been watching Lov ever since he was first seen an hour before on the sand hill nearly two miles away, and now that he was actually within reach, they were prepared to stop him from carrying the turnips any farther. Lov had his wife to feed and provide for, in addition to himself, and he was careful not to allow any of the Lester\u0027s to come too close to the sack of turnips. Usually when he came by the Lester place with turnips or sweet potatoes, or for that matter with any kind of food, he left the road half a mile from the house and made a wide circle through the fields, returning to the road a safe distance beyond. To-day, though, he had to speak to Jeeter about something of great importance, and he had ventured closer to the house than he had ever done before when carrying home turnips, or sweet potatoes. Lov\u0027s wife was Jeeter Lester\u0027s youngest daughter, Pearl. She was only twelve years old the summer before when he had married her. The Lester\u0027s watched Lov closely while he stood in the middle of the road. He had dropped the sack from his shoulder, but he held the neck of it in the rigid grasp of both hands. No one in the yard had changed his position during the past ten minutes. The next move was entirely up to Lov. When Lov came to the house and stopped, he had a good reason for doing so; otherwise he would never have come within hailing distance. He wanted to speak to Jeeter about Pearl Pearl would not talk. She would not say a word, no matter how persuasive Lov tried to be, nor how angry he was; she even hid from Lov when he came home from the coal chute, and when he found her, she slipped away from his grasp and ran off into the broom-sedge out of sight. Sometimes she would even stay in the broom-sedge all night, remaining out there until Lov went to work the next morning. Pearl had never talked, for that matter. Not because she could not but simply because she did not want to. When she was at home, before Lov had married her, she had stayed apart from the other Lester\u0027s and rarely opened her mouth from the beginning of one day to the next. Only her mother, Ada, had been able to converse with her, and even then Pearl had never used more than the barest of negatives and affirmatives in reply. But Ada was herself like that. She had begun to talk voluntarily only during the past ten years. Before then, Jeeter had had the same trouble with her that Lov was now having with Pearl. Lov asked Pearl questions, he kicked her, he poured water over her, he threw rocks and sticks at her, and he did everything else he could think of that he thought might make her talk to him. She cried a lot, especially when she was seriously hurt, but Lov did not consider that as conversation. He wanted her to ask him if his back were sore, and when was he going to get his hair cut, and when was it going to rain again. But Pearl would not say anything. He had spoken to Jeeter several times before about his troubles with Pearl, but Jeeter did not know what was the matter with her. Ever since she was a baby she had been like that, he said; and Ada had remained untalkative until the last few years. What Jeeter had not been able to break down in Ada for forty years, hunger had. Hunger loosened her tongue, and she had been complaining ever since. Jeeter did not attempt to recommend the starving of Pearl, because he knew she would go somewhere to beg food, and would get it. \"Sometimes I think it\u0027s just the old devil in her,\" Lov had said several times. \"To my way of thinking, she ain\u0027t got a scratch of religion in her. She\u0027s goin\u0027 to hell-fire when she dies, sure as day comes.\" \"Now, maybe she ain\u0027t pleased with her married life,\" Jeeter had suggested. \"Maybe she ain\u0027t satisfied with what you provide her with.\" \"I done everything I can think of to make her satisfied and contented. Every week I go to Fuller on pay-day and buy her a pretty. I get her snuff, but she won\u0027t take none; I get her a little piece of calico, but she won\u0027t sew it. Looks like she wants something I ain\u0027t got and can\u0027t get her. I wish I knowed what it was. She\u0027s such a pretty little girl--all them long yellow curls hanging down her back sort of gets me all crazy sometimes. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen to me. I\u0027ve got the need of Pearl for a wife as bad as any man ever had.\" \"I expect she\u0027s too young yet to appreciate things,\" Jeeter had said. \"She ain\u0027t grown up yet like Ellie May and Lizzie Belle and Clara and the other gals. Pearl ain\u0027t nothing but a little gal yet. She don\u0027t even look like a woman, so far.\" \"If I had knowed she was going to be like she is, maybe I wouldn\u0027t have wanted to marry her so bad. I could have married me a woman what wants to be married to me. But I don\u0027t want Pearl to go now, though. I sort of got used to her around, and I\u0027d sure miss seeing them long yellow curls hanging down her back. They make a man feel kind of lonesome some way. She sure is a pretty little girl, no matter if she does act like she does all the time.\" Lov had gone back home that time and told Pearl what Jeeter said about her, but she sat in the chair \u0027and made no sign of answering him. Lov did not know what to do about her after that. But he had realized from that time on that she was still a little girl. During the eight months they had been married she had grown three or four inches in height, and she weighed about fifteen pounds more now than she had at the beginning. She still did not weigh much more than a hundred pounds, though she was gaining in weight and height every day. What Lov wanted to speak to Jeeter about now in particular was the way Pearl had of refusing to sleep with him. They had been married almost a year, and still she slept by herself, as she had done since the first. She slept by herself on a pallet on the floor, refusing even to let Lov kiss her or touch her in any way. Lov had told her that cows were not any good until they had been freshened, and that the reason he married her was because he wanted to kiss her and feel her long yellow curls and sleep with her; but Pearl had not even indicated that she heard him or knew what he was talking about. Next to wanting to kiss her and talk to her, Lov wanted to see her eyes. Yet even this pleasure she denied him; her pale blue eyes were always looking off into another direction when he came and stood in front of her. Lov still stood in the middle of the road looking at Jeeter and the other Lester\u0027s in the yard. They were waiting for him to make the first move; friendly or hostile, it mattered little to them so long as there were turnips in the sack. Jeeter was wondering where Lov had got the turnips. It did not occur to him that Lov had bought them with money; Jeeter had long before come to the conclusion that the only possible way a quantity of food could be obtained was by theft. But he had not been able to locate a turnip patch that year anywhere within five or six miles. There had been planted a two-acre field the year before over at the Peabody place, but the Peabody men had kept people out of the field with shotguns then, and this year they had not even planted turnips. \"Why don\u0027t you come in the yard off the tobacco road, Lov?\" Jeeter said. \"Ain\u0027t no sense standing out there. Come in and rest yourself.\" Lov made no reply, nor did he move. He was debating within himself the danger of entering the yard, against the safety of staying where he was in the road. For the past few weeks Lov had been thinking about taking some plow-lines and tying Pearl in the bed at night. He had tried everything that he could think of so far, except force, and he was still determined to make her act as he thought a wife should. He had reached the point now where he wanted Jeeter\u0027s advice before going ahead with the plan. He believed Jeeter would know whether it was advisable from the practical side, since Jeeter had had to contend with Ada for almost a lifetime. He knew Ada had once acted as Pearl was now doing, but Jeeter had not been treated as he was treated, because Ada had borne him seventeen children, while Pearl had not even, begun to have the first one. If Jeeter said it would be satisfactory to tie Pearl in bed, then he would go ahead and do it. Jeeter knew more about such things than he did. Jeeter had been married to Ada forty years. Lov hoped that Jeeter would offer to go down to the house at the coal chute and help him tie Pearl in the bed. Pearl fought back so fiercely whenever he attempted to catch her that he was afraid he would not be able to accomplish anything without Jeeter\u0027s help. The Lester\u0027s stood around in the yard and on the front porch waiting to see what Love was going to do next. There had been very little in the house again that day to eat; some salty soup Ada had made by boiling several fatback rinds in a pan of water, and corn bread, was all there was when they had sat down to eat. There had not been enough to go around even then, and the old grandmother had been shoved out of the kitchen when she tried to conic inside. Ellie May stood behind a chinaberry tree, looking around the trunk at Lov. She moved her head from one side of the tree to the other, trying to attract Lov\u0027s attention. Ellie May and Dude were the only Lester children left at home. All the others had gone away and married, some of them just leaving in a casual way as though they were only walking down to the coal chute to see the freight trains. When they failed to return within two or three days, it was known that they had left home. Dude was throwing a lopsided baseball at the side of the house, and catching it on the rebound. The ball hit the house like a clap of thunder, rattling the loose weather-boarding until the vibration swayed the house from side to side. He threw the ball continually, the ball bounding with unfailing regularity back across the sandy yard to where he stood. The three-room house sat precariously on stacks of thin lime-rock chips that had been placed under the four corners. The stones had been laid one on top of the other, the beams spiked, and the house nailed together. The ease and simplicity with which it had been built was now evident. The centre of the building sagged between the sills; the front porch had sagged loose from the house, and was now a foot or more lower than it originally was; and the roof sagged in the centre where the supporting rafters had been carelessly put together. Most of the shingles had rotted,, and after every wind-storm pieces of them were scattered in all directions about the yard. When the roof leaked, the Lester\u0027s moved from one corner of the room to another, their movements finally outlasting the duration of the rain. The house had never been painted. Jeeter was trying to patch a rotten inner-tube. He had said that if he could ever get all the tires on the old automobile standing up at the same time again, he would haul a load of wood to Augusta and sell it. Woodcutters were being paid two dollars a load for seasoned pine delivered in the city; but the blackjack that Jeeter tried to make people buy for fuel never brought him more than fifty or seventy-five cents. Usually, when he did succeed in getting a load of it to Augusta, he was not, able to give it away; nobody, it seemed, was foolish enough to buy wood that was tougher than iron water-pipes. People argued with Jeeter about his mule-like determination to sell blackjack for fuel, and they tried to convince him that as firewood it was practically worthless; but Jeeter said he wanted to clear the land of the scrub oak because he was getting ready to farm it again. Lov had by that time moved a few steps nearer the yard and had sat down in the tobacco road with his feet in the drain ditch. He kept one hand gripped tightly around the mouth of the sack where it had been tied together with a piece of twine. Ellie May continued to peer from behind the chinaberry tree, trying to attract Lov\u0027s attention. Each time he glanced in that direction, she jerked her head back so he could not see her. \"What you got in that there croker sack, Lov?\" Jeeter shouted across the yard. \"I been seeing you come a far piece off with that there croker sack on your back. I sure would like to know what you got on the inside of it. I heard it said that some people has got turnips this year.\" Lov tightened his grip on the mouth of the sack, looking from Jeeter to the next Lester in turn. He saw Ellie May peering at him from behind the chinaberry tree. \"Did you have a hard time getting what you got there in the sack, Lov?\" Jeeter said. \"You look like you is all out of breath.\" \"I want to say something to you, Jeeter,\" he said. \"It\u0027s about Pearl.\" \"What\u0027s that gal done now, Lov? Is she treating you mean some more?\" \"It\u0027s just like she\u0027s always done, only I\u0027m getting pretty durn tired of it by this time. I don\u0027t like the way she acts. I never did take to the way she does, but it\u0027s getting worse and worse all the time. All the niggers make fun of me because of the way she treats me.\" \"Pearl is just like her Ma,\" Jeeter said. \"Her Ma used to do the queerest things in her time.\" \"Every time I want to have her round me, she runs off and won\u0027t come back when I call her. Now, what I say is, what in hell is the sense in me marrying a wife if I don\u0027t get none of the benefits. God didn\u0027t intend for it to be that way. He don\u0027t want a man to be treated like that. It\u0027s all right for a woman to sort of tease a man into doing what she wants done, but Pearl don\u0027t seem to be aiming after that. She ain\u0027t teasing me, to her way of thinking, but it sure does act that way on me. Right now I feel like I want a woman who ain\u0027t so--\" \"What you got in that there croker sack, Lov?\" Jeeter said. \"I been seeing you for the past hour or longer, ever since you came over the top of that far hill yonder.\" \"Turnips, by God,\" Lov said, looking at the Lester women. \"Where\u0027d you get turnips, Lov?\" \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to know!\" \"I was thinking maybe we might fix up some sort of a trade, Lov--.me and you. Now, I could go down to your house and sort of tell Pearl she\u0027s got to sleep in the bed with you. That\u0027s what you was aiming to speak to me about, wasn\u0027t it? You want her to sleep in the bed, don\u0027t you?\" \"She ain\u0027t never slept in the bed. It\u0027s that durn pallet on the floor that she sleeps on every night. Reckon you could make her stop doing that, Jeeter?\" \"I\u0027d be pleased something powerful to make her do what she ain\u0027t doing. That is, if me and you could make a trade with them turnips, Lov.\" \"That\u0027s what I came by here for--to speak to you about Pearl. But I ain\u0027t going to let you have none of these turnips, though. I had to pay fifty cents for this many in a sack, and I had to walk all the way to the other side of Fuller and back to fetch them. You\u0027re Pearl\u0027s daddy, and you ought to make her behave for nothing. She don\u0027t pay no attention to nothing I tell her to do.\" \"By God and by Jesus, Lov, all the damn-blasted turnips I raised this year is wormy. And I ain\u0027t had a good turnip since a year ago this spring. All my turnips has got them damn-blasted green-gutted worms in them, Lov. What God made turnip-worms for, I can\u0027t make out. It appears to me like He just naturally has got it in good and heavy for a poor man. I worked all the fall last year digging up a patch of ground to grow turnips in, and then when they\u0027re getting about big enough to pull and eat, along comes these damn-blasted green-gutted turnip worms and bore clear to the middle of them. God is got it in good and heavy for the poor. But I ain\u0027t complaining, Lov. I say, \u0027The good Lord knows best about turnips.\u0027 Some of these days He\u0027ll bust loose with a heap of bounty and all us poor folks will have all we want to eat and plenty to clothe us with. It can\u0027t always keep getting worse and worse every year like it has got since the big war. God, He\u0027ll put a stop to it some of these days and make the rich give back all they\u0027ve took from us poor folks. God is going to treat us right. He ain\u0027t going to let it keep on like it is now. But we got to stop cussing Him when we ain\u0027t got nothing to eat. He\u0027ll send a man to hell and the devil for persisting in doing that.\" Lov dragged the sack of turnips across the drain ditch and sat down again. Jeeter laid aside the rotten inner-tube and waited.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842/53365.html","bookId":999,"book":{"id":999,"title":"Tobacco Road 烟草路","description":"简介： 《烟草路》以喜剧性夸张手法来描写悲剧，夸大人物的古怪性格和荒唐行为，突出人物同环境之间的格格不入以及他的悲惨结局，是一部用幽默笔调表现当时美国南方生活的贫穷、愚昧、落后的杰作。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/25/10-39-17-45-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1842","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
