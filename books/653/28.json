You rub your legs with your dusty wings; Your fiddle shrieks till the welkin rings; On meadow green, through the livelong day, You saw and eat till they’re bare and gray Zee-e-e, zee-e-, zee-e-e! The green katydid. Dear me, dear me! The finest chap. Just see, just see; You play so hard and you trill so long, Your midget wife ne’er can sing a song, Still you rub your wings in the drollest way While dancing clover blossoms swing and sway Zig, zig, z-i-g, zig, zig, z-i-g! 212Cone-headed grasshopper, zip-zee, zip-zee, The insects’ clown is he, is he!
