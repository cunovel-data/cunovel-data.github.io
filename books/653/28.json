But why? \n You rub your legs with your dusty wings; \n Your fiddle shrieks till the welkin rings; \n On meadow green, through the livelong day, \n You saw and eat till they’re bare and gray \n Zee-e-e, zee-e-, zee-e-e! \n The green katydid. Dear me, dear me! \n The finest chap. Just see, just see; \n You play so hard and you trill so long, \n Your midget wife ne’er can sing a song, \n Still you rub your wings in the drollest way \n While dancing clover blossoms swing and sway \n Zig, zig, z-i-g, zig, zig, z-i-g! \n 212Cone-headed grasshopper, zip-zee, zip-zee, \n The insects’ clown is he, is he! \n From Maine o’er plains to the Rockies found, \n With foolscap forehead and shrilling sound, \n From bush and bramble your roundelay \n Comes sharp and clear through the summer day, \n Z-szip-zee.
