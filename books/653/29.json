{"id":34937,"no":29,"title":"CASTLE FORTUNE","content":"One fine morning at sunrise, two strong young men were sauntering along through the fields. As they journeyed toward the east the gray morning mist cleared away in the distance, and there on a very high hill stood a beautiful castle with sparkling windows and glistening towers all bathed in the morning light. \n \n “Come,” said one of the youths eagerly, “let us go over to it!” \n \n “What!” exclaimed the other, who was a lazy fellow, “do you not know that it is miles away? I am sure I cannot walk so far.” \n \n “Try,” said a sweet strange voice. \n \n On turning about they saw a lovely fairy 214dressed in gauzy white, holding a golden wand in her hand. She was standing on a magic crystal ball which rolled along with her toward the distant castle. As she passed the travelers, she pointed with her wand toward the east smilingly, and said, “Follow me!” \n \n “That would be easy to do,” mumbled the lazy youth, “if one could roll along as you do with no effort.” He then threw himself down on the grass to rest. \n \n His companion, however, started off after the fairy as fast as he could run, and catching hold of her floating robe he cried, “Who are you?” \n \n “I am Fortune,” she answered. “Yonder is my castle. Follow me there. Waste no time, and if you reach the castle before midnight I’ll receive you as a friend. But remember! If you come one moment after the last stroke of midnight, the door will be closed against you.” \n \n With these words the fairy drew her robe about her and rolled swiftly on in the morning 215breeze. And the crystal ball sparkled, sparkled in the sunlight. \n \n The youth now hurried back to his companion and said breathlessly, “Yonder is the Castle of Fortune. Come! Let us go!” \n \n “What nonsense!” said the lazy youth. “With a good horse one might get there easily, but for my part I don’t intend to try to walk all that way.” \n \n “Farewell, then,” said his friend, and away he started briskly with his eyes fixed steadily on the distant towers. The lazy youth sighed wearily and threw himself down on the soft grass. “If only good luck would show me an easy way to get there,” he murmured. “How beautiful the castle looks!” He then stretched himself out and fell fast asleep. In a little while he was awakened by something like a warm breeze blowing in his ear. He slowly rubbed his eyes and yawned aloud. Then he heard the neighing of a horse, and turning, he saw standing near a beautiful milk white steed all saddled and bridled! \n \n “Good luck,” he cried. “Come here, my 216fine friend. You and I will soon reach the castle.” Then he jumped into the saddle and started off at a fine gait. \n \n He soon passed his comrade and called out, “What do you think of my steed?” \n \n The other did not speak, but nodded cheerily and kept on at a steady pace. \n \n About midday the horse and rider reached the summit of a hill. In the distance the castle towers shone brightly against the clear blue sky. Presently the horse turned into a shady grove on the hillside and stopped. \n \n “A very good idea!” exclaimed the lazy man. “‘Make haste slowly’ is good wisdom. This shady slope is a fine place to rest awhile, and my appetite is keen enough to enjoy the luncheon I have in my pocket.” So, jumping off, he found a cool shady nook and stretched himself out on the grass. \n \n After he had eaten his savory sandwich he felt so drowsy that he soon fell into a sound sleep. What a pleasant sleep he had! He dreamed he was in Castle Fortune resting on downy cushions. Every wish he had was 217granted! Soft strains of music soothed him, while brilliant fireworks all crimson and gold were set off in his honor. This continued for some time, when suddenly the explosion of a beautiful Roman candle awoke him. He sat up rubbing his eyes. In the west the sun was sinking, and he could hear the song of a traveler in the valley below! “I must have been asleep a long while!” he murmured. “It is high time to be off. Ready, my steed! Where are you?” \n \n He whistled and shouted again and again, but no steed came. An old bony gray donkey browsing on the hilltop was the only creature in sight. “Better a donkey than nothing,” the lazy man thought. So he walked slowly over to the place where the beast was grazing, and mounted him. \n \n After some urging, the donkey set off at a slow jog. The lazy man soon found that this kind of traveling was very uncomfortable. The donkey trudged slowly on. Soon it began to grow dark. In the distance he could see that the castle was being lighted up. How 218beautiful it looked. He was becoming anxious. If only the donkey would move a little faster. But instead he seemed to be going slower and slower, slower and slower, until in the midst of a thick wood the beast stood still and refused to move. The rider coaxed and threatened and urged and kicked. It was of no use. The donkey refused to move. At last the lazy man was thoroughly aroused. He struck the beast a hard blow with his fist, screaming, “Get on, I say.” Up went the donkey’s heels and over his head into the briers and stones went the rider. What a plight to be in! He was bruised and sore and bewildered. He sat up and tried to collect his thoughts. Ah! There in the distance the lights were shining in Castle Fortune. Oh, for a soft comfortable couch on which to rest his aching bones. The stubborn old donkey! Where could he be? \n \n He crept about in every direction, hoping to find his donkey, but after tearing his clothes and bruising himself he gave up the search. Suddenly his hand struck something that 219felt a little like a saddle. It was mounted on something soft and slimy. \n \n He hesitated. Castle Fortune’s clock was striking. He counted the strokes. “Eleven o’clock!” he exclaimed in amazement. He threw himself into the queer saddle. “This is rather comfortable,” he exclaimed as he leaned against a high back. How slowly the creature moved. At last they reached a clearing, where a long straight road led directly to Castle Fortune with its beautiful towers and its windows ablaze with lights. \n \n The sight of the castle filled him with longing. He turned his attention for a minute to the strange creature he was riding. Horror! He was mounted on a huge snail, quite as large as a calf. No wonder they had crept along at a snail’s pace. \n \n One! The great clock struck the first stroke of the midnight hour. He pushed both heels into his steed’s soft sides. In an instant the snail drew his head into the shell and rolled over on the ground. \n \n Two! struck the great clock. Had the 220lazy man taken to his heels he might even now have reached the castle before the last stroke of the great clock. But no! There he stood filled with regret and fear. “A beast! A beast!” he cried, “Oh, for any kind of a beast to carry me to the castle!” \n \n Three! What was moving near him? Was it the long lost steed? Without further thought he jumped into something like a low saddle. His heart leaped as he looked up! There in the open door of Castle Fortune stood his friend waving his cap and beckoning to him. \n \n Four! chimed the great clock. The queer steed began to rouse himself. \n \n Five! The creature moved slowly forward. \n \n Six! What an awkward steed it was. \n \n Seven! Which way were they going? \n \n Eight! What! Were they moving backward? Impossible! He would jump off and run. \n \n Nine! To our rider’s great surprise he found he was held fast by the creature’s claws 221which extended on all sides. Horror! He was riding on a giant crab! \n \n Ten! Backward they moved! \n \n Eleven! Farther and farther they were going away from the castle. \n \n TWELVE! The castle doors shut with a clang. Castle Fortune’s doors were closed forever to the lazy man. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1708/50321.html","bookId":653,"book":{"id":653,"title":"Merry Tales","description":"简介： To keep children sane and sweet they must be given bright and cheery stories to read.
