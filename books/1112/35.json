{"id":21990,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV. JESúS DOMíNGUEZ.","content":"At the end of an hour, don Jaime left the palace followed by López, went to the house in the suburbs, where he found the count and his friend, who wholly occupied with their love, and indifferent to the events that were going on around them, spent whole days with those whom they loved, enjoying with the happy carelessness of youth the present, which seemed to them so sweet, without wishing to think of the future. \"Oh, here you are at last, brother!\" do?a María exclaimed joyfully. \"What a stranger you have grown!\" \"Business!\" the adventurer answered with a smile. The table was laid in the centre of the room. The count\u0027s two menservants were preparing to serve, and Leo Carral, with a napkin on his arm, was waiting for the party to sit down. \"My faith, since supper is on the table,\" don Jaime said gaily, \"I will not let you sup alone with these caballeros, if you will permit me to bear you company.\" \"What happiness!\" do?a Carmen exclaimed. The gentlemen offered a hand to the ladies and led them to their seats, after which they sat down by their side. The supper began. It was as it should be among persons who had loved and known each other for a long time—that is to say, cheerful and full of pleasant intimacy. Never had the young ladies been so happy, for this unexpected pleasure charmed them. The hours passed rapidly, but no one thought of calling attention to the fact: all at once midnight struck on a clock standing on a console in the dining room The twelve strokes fell one after the other with a majestic slowness into the midst of the conversation, which they suddenly chilled and stopped. \"Good gracious!\" do?a Dolores exclaimed, with a slight start of terror, \"So late!\" \"How time passes!\" don Jaime said carelessly. \"We must now think of going.\" They left the table; and the three friends, after promising to visit the three recluses as often and soon as possible, at length withdrew, leaving the ladies at liberty to retire. López was waiting for his master under the zaguán. \"What do you want?\" the latter asked him. \"We are spied,\" the peon answered. He led him to the gate and noiselessly pulled back the bolt. Don Jaime looked out. Exactly opposite the gate a man was standing, almost confounded with the darkness that prevailed in a hollow formed by the scaffolding of a house under repair. It would have escaped any less piercing glance than that of the adventurer. \"I believe you are right,\" don Jaime said to the peon. \"In any case, it is urgent to make sure, and I will undertake it,\" he added between his teeth, with a terrible expression. \"Change cloak and hat with me. You will accompany these caballeros. The man saw three persons enter, and he must see three depart. Now mount and be off.\" \"But,\" said Dominique, \"I fancy it would be more simple to kill the man.\" \"That may happen,\" don Jaime answered; \"but I wish to make certain beforehand that he is a spy: I do not care to commit a mistake. Do not be anxious about me, within half an hour I will join you again and inform you of what has taken place between this man and myself.\" \"Good-bye for the present, then,\" the count said, shaking his hand. \"Good-bye.\" They then went out, followed by Leo Carral and the count\u0027s two servants. Do?a María\u0027s old servant closed the gate with a bang, but was careful to open it again noiselessly. Don Jaime placed himself at the wicket, whence it was easy to watch all the movements of the supposed spy. At the noise caused by the departure of the young men, the latter eagerly bent forward, doubtless to remark the direction they followed, and then returned to his dark corner, where he resumed his statuesque immobility. Nearly a quarter of an hour passed ere the man made the slightest movement. Don Jaime did not lose him out of sight. At length he cautiously emerged from his hiding place, looked carefully around him, and reassured by the solitude of the street, he ventured to take a few steps forward; then, after a moment\u0027s hesitation, he boldly advanced toward the house, crossing the street in a straight line. Suddenly the gate opened and he found himself face to face with don Jaime. He made a sudden backward movement and tried to fly, but the adventurer seized his arm which he held as in a vice, and dragging him after him, in spite of the obstinate resistance he offered, he drew him up to a statuette of the Virgin placed in a niche above a shop, in front of which some tapers were burning, and then, with a backhander he knocked off his prisoner\u0027s hat and curiously examined his features. \"Ah, se?or Jesús Domínguez,\" he said an instant after, in an ironical voice, \"is it you? ?Viva Dios! I did not expect to meet you here.\" The poor wretch looked piteously at the man in whose power he was, but made no answer. The adventurer waited a moment, then seeing that his prisoner was decidedly determined, on not answering him, he said, as he gave him a rough shake:— \"Come, scoundrel, are you going to answer or no?\" The prisoner gave a hollow groan. \"It is El Rayo or the fiend!\" he muttered in horror, as he looked despairingly at the masked face of the man who held him so securely. \"It is certainly one or the other,\" the adventurer continued with a laugh. \"So you are in good hands and need not feel alarmed. Now be good enough to tell me how it is that you, a guerillero and highway robber, have become a spy and doubtless an assassin, if necessary, in this capital.\" \"Misfortunes, Excellency. I was calumniated. I was too honest!\" \"You? Hang me if I believe a word of it. I know you too thoroughly, scoundrel, for you to try to deceive me. Hence decide to tell me the truth, and that at once, without further subterfuge, or I will kill you like the cowardly zopilote you are.\" \"Would you have any objection, Excellency, to hold my arm not quite so tightly? You are twisting it so cruelly, that it must be broken.\" \"Very good,\" he said, loosing his hold; \"but make no attempt to fly, for you would suffer for it. Now speak.\" Jesús Domínguez, on feeling himself delivered from the adventurer\u0027s rough grasp, gave a sigh of relief, shook his arm several times, in order to re-establish the circulation, and then decided on speaking. \"I will tell you first, Excellency,\" he said, \"that I am still a guerillero, and have risen to the rank of lieutenant.\" \"All the better for you. But what are you doing here?\" \"I am on an expedition.\" \"On an expedition, alone, in Mexico? What! Are you laughing at me, villain?\" \"I swear, on the share I hope in Paradise, that I am telling you the strict truth, Excellency. Besides, I am not here alone; my captain accompanies me, and it was by his express orders I came.\" \"Ah, ah! And who is this captain?\" \"Oh, you know him, Excellency,\" \"That is probable. But he has a name, I suppose?\" \"Certainly Excellency. He is don Melchior de la Cruz.\" \"I suspected it. Now I can guess all. You are ordered to spy do?a Dolores de la Cruz, I suppose?\" \"Yes, Excellency.\" \"Good, what next?\" \"Well, that is all, Excellency.\" \"Oh, no, it is not, my scamp; there is something more yet.\" \"But I assure you—\" \"Ah, I see I must employ a grand method,\" he said, coldly, cocking a pistol. \"Why, what are you doing, Excellency?\" he exclaimed in terror. \"I should think you can see that I am simply preparing to blow out your brains. Hence, if you wish to try and commend your soul to Heaven, make haste and do it, as you have only two minutes left to live.\" \"But that is not the way to make me speak,\" he said, with simplicity. \"No,\" the adventurer answered, coldly; \"but it will make you hold your tongue.\" \"Hum,\" he said, \"you employ such excellent arguments, Excellency, that it is impossible to resist you. I prefer telling you everything!\" \"You will act wisely.\" \"Well, this is the matter in a few words. I was not only ordered to watch do?a Dolores, but also the old and young lady with whom she resides, as well as all the persons who visit them.\" \"Hang it all! That was work enough for one man.\" \"Not too much, Excellency. They hardly receive any visits.\" \"And since when have you carried on this honourable trade, scoundrel?\" \"About ten or twelve days, Excellency.\" \"So, then, you were one of the bandits who attempted to enter the house by main force?\" \"Yes, Excellency, but we did not succeed.\" \"I know it. Are you well paid by your employer?\" \"He has not given me anything yet, I must allow; but he has promised me fifty ounces.\" \"Oh! Promises cost don Melchior nothing. It is easier to promise fifty ounces than to give ten piastres.\" \"Do you think so, Excellency? Is he not rich?\" \"He? He is poorer than yourself.\" \"In that case he must be badly off, for up to the present all my savings consist of debts.\" \"I really think you are a precious ass, and that you deserve what has happened to you.\" \"I! Excellency?\" \"Hang it! Yes, who else? What, scoundrel! You attach yourself to a villain who has not a farthing—who is hopelessly ruined, instead of taking side with those who could pay you.\" \"Who are they, if you please, Excellency? I confess that I have very long fingers, and would serve such persons enthusiastically.\" \"I do not doubt it. Do you fancy that I am going to amuse myself by giving you advice?\" \"Ah! if you would, Excellency, I should be delighted to serve you.\" \"You? Nonsense.\" \"Why not, Excellency?\" \"Hang it! As you are the enemy of those whom I love, you must be my enemy too.\" \"Oh! If I had only known it!\" \"What would you have done?\" \"I do not know, but certainly I should not have played the spy on them. Employ me, Excellency, I implore you.\" \"You are fit for nothing.\" \"Try me, and you will see, Excellency; that is all I say.\" The adventurer pretended to reflect. Jesús Domínguez anxiously waited. \"No,\" he said at last; \"you are a man who cannot be trusted.\" \"Oh, how badly you know me, Excellency, when I am so devoted to you!\" The adventurer burst into a laugh. \"That is a devotion which has sprung up very rapidly,\" he said. \"Well, I consent to make a trial: but suppose you deceive me?\" \"It is enough, Excellency: I know you; you will be contented with me. What do you want?\" \"You will only have to turn your dolman, that is all.\" \"Good, I understand, that is easy: my master will not take a step without your being warned of it.\" \"Good! Has not our dear don Melchior an intimate friend?\" \"Yes, Excellency, a certain don Antonio Cacerbar. They are united like the fingers of a hand.\" \"There will be no harm in your watching him, too.\" \"I am quite willing.\" \"And as all trouble deserves payment, I will give you half an ounce in advance.\" \"Half an ounce?\" he exclaimed, with a radiant look. \"And as you are in want of money, I will advance you twenty days\u0027 pay.\" \"Ten ounces! You will give me ten ounces, Excellency! To me! Oh! It is impossible!\" \"It is so possible that here they are,\" he continued, taking them from his pocket, and placing them in Jesús\u0027 hand. The bandit clutched them with a movement of feverish joy. \"Oh!\" he exclaimed; \"Don Melchior and his friend had better look out.\" \"Be adroit, for they are clever.\" \"I know them; but they have to do with a cleverer fellow: trust to me for that.\" \"That is your business. At the slightest mistake, I give you up.\" \"I do not fear that happiness.\" \"Did you not allude to the dexterity of your fingers?\" \"Yes, I did, Excellency.\" \"Well, if by chance these gentlemen let any papers of importance fall, you will do well to pick them up and bring them to me at once. I am of a very curious nature.\" \"Enough. If I do not find any lying about, I will look for them.\" \"That is a good idea, which I approve of. Ah! Remember this: the papers count separately. Each of them, if worth it, will fetch you three ounces. If you make a mistake it will be all the worse for you, as you will receive nothing.\" \"I will take my precautions, Excellency. Now will you be kind enough to tell me where I can find you when I have communications to make, or papers to deliver?\" \"That is very easy. I walk every afternoon from three till five along the canal de Las Vigas.\" \"I will be there.\" \"Pray be prudent.\" \"As an opossum, Excellency.\" \"Good-bye: watch attentively.\" \"Excellency. I have the honour to salute you.\" They separated. Don Jaime, after ordering his sister\u0027s old servant who, during the whole of this conversation had held the gate open to go in and secure it on the inside, proceeded toward the residence of the young man rubbing his hands. The count and his friend, disturbed by don Jaime\u0027s long absence, were awaiting him with a feeling of lively anxiety, they were already preparing to go in search of him, when he entered: they received him with warm testimonies of joy, and then asked him about his expedition. Don Jaime saw no reason for keeping them in ignorance of what had taken place, and he repeated to them in detail his conversation with Jesús Domínguez, and how he had led him to betray his master. This narrative greatly amused the young men. The three remained together till daybreak: shortly before sunrise they separated, don Jaime\u0027s last remark on leaving them being the following: \"My friends, though my conduct may seem to you so extraordinary, do not judge of it yet: in a few days at the most, I shall strike the great blow which I have been preparing for so many years. Everything will then be explained to you, whatever the result may be, and hence be patient, for you are more interested than you suppose in the success of this affair: remember what you promised me and hold yourselves in readiness to act when I claim your assistance. Farewell.\" He pressed their hands affectionately and withdrew. A whole week passed away without any events worthy of record. Still a dull anxiety prevailed in the city: numerous meetings in which all the new political movements were discussed, were held in the squares and in the streets. In the mercantile quarters of the city, the shops were only opened for a few hours, and provisions became more and more scarce, and consequently dearer, as only a few Indians came to the city and brought very little with them. A vague agitation, without any known or definite cause prevailed among the population: it was felt that the critical moment was approaching and that the storm; so long suspended over Mexico would soon burst with; a terrible fury. Don Jaime, apparently at least, led the idle life of a man whom his position places above all accidents, and for whom political events possess no importance: he strolled about the squares and streets, smoking his cigar, listening to everything that was said with the simplicity of a believer, accepting as true all the monstrous absurdities invented by the novelists of the street corners, and not saying a word himself. Every day he took a walk on the canal de Las Vigas, accident made him meet Jesús Domínguez, they conversed for a long time while walking side by side, and then separated apparently mutually satisfied. For the last two or three days, however, don Jaime had not seemed so pleased with his spy, sharp words and covert threats were exchanged between them. \"My friend Jesús Domínguez;\" don Jaime said to his spy at the sixth or seventh interview he had with him: \"take care; I fancy I can perceive that you have been trying to play a double game. I have a fine nose as you are aware, and scent treachery.\" \"Oh, Excellency,\" Jesús Domínguez exclaimed, \"you are mistaken; I am on the contrary most faithful, be assured of that, for men do not betray a generous caballero like yourself.\" \"That is possible; at any rate you are warned, and act accordingly; and mind not to forget to bring me tomorrow the papers you have promised me for the last three days.\" Upon this don Jaime left the spy greatly abashed by this sharp reprimand, and very anxious as to the turn matters might take if he did not act prudently; for, it must be confessed, Jesús Domínguez\u0027 conscience was not very tranquil. Don Jaime\u0027s suspicions were not totally devoid of foundation; if the spy had not yet betrayed his generous protector, the idea had occurred to him of doing so, and for a man like the guerillero, from thought to execution was only a step. Hence he resolved to rehabilitate himself in don Jaime\u0027s opinion by a brilliant stroke in order to regain his confidence; for this purpose he decided on taking the papers which don Jaime asked of him, and handing them to him on the morrow, with a determination of stealing them from him again if he considered it worth the while. On the next day, at the appointed hour, don Jaime was at the place of meeting: Jesús Domínguez speedily arrived, and with a great display of devotedness according to his wont, handed a rather large bundle of papers to the adventurer; the latter took a rapid glance at them, concealed them under his cloak, and after letting a heavy purse of gold drop into the guerillero\u0027s hand, he brusquely turned his back on him, without listening to his protestations. \"?Diablos!\" Jesús Domínguez muttered. \"He does not seem in a very sweet temper today, so I must not leave him the time to take his precautions: I have luckily discovered where he lives, and now I must act and go and tell everything to don Melchior. I shall be able to arrange matters so that he will believe I have only manoeuvred to make his enemy confident, and betray him the more easily; and as I intend to betray him, don Melchior will be enchanted, and congratulate me on my skill. By Heavens! Sense is a fine thing. I am decidedly a man full of intelligence.\" While complimenting himself thus in an aside, Jesús Domínguez, who was walking with his head down as persons who are reflecting do, ran full butt against two individuals who were walking arm in arm and conversing. The two persons were probably quick tempered, for they turned sharply, and addressed some rather harsh reproaches to the guerillero. The latter, who felt himself in the wrong, and as he had a considerable sum about him, did not feel anxious to get into an ugly quarrel, attempted to apologize as well as he could. But the strangers would listen to nothing, and continued to apply to him the epithets of brute, ass, and other compliments of the sort. Though the guerillero was on his guard, his patience at length deserted him, and letting himself be overpowered by passion, he laid his hand on his knife. This imprudent action was his ruin. The two strangers rushed upon him, knocked him down, and both stabbed him repeatedly; then, as the street in which this quarrel took place was entirely deserted, and consequently no one had seen them, they assured themselves that the poor fellow was really dead; after which they quietly went off, though not till they had eased him of his money and everything that could prove his identity. Thus died se?or Jesús Domínguez. The celadores picked up his body two hours later, and as no one recognized it, it was unceremoniously cast into a hole dug in the cemetery, without further enquiry. Don Melchior was perhaps astonished at not seeing him again; but as he placed slight confidence in his honesty, he supposed that he had committed some roguery, which rendered his absence advisable, and thought no more of him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773/51702.html","bookId":1112,"book":{"id":1112,"title":"The Rebel Chief","description":"简介： No country in the world offers to the delighted traveller more charming landscapes than Mexico; among them all, that of Las Cumbres or the peak, is, without fear of contradiction, one of the most striking and most agreeably diversified....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
