{"id":21962,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII. THE RANCHO.","content":"The state of Puebla is composed of a plateau mountain, more than five and twenty leagues in circumference, crossed by the lofty Cordilleras of Anahuac. \n \n The plains which surround the town are very diversified, cut up by ravines, studded with hills, and closed on the horizon by mountains covered by eternal snows. \n \n Immense fields of aloes, the real vineyards of the country, as pulque, that beverage so dear to the Mexicans, is made from this plant, extend beyond the range of vision. \n \n There is no sight so imposing as these commanding aloes, whose leaves, armed with formidable points, are thick, hard, lustrous, and from six to eight feet in length. \n \n On leaving Puebla by the Mexico road, about two leagues further on, you come to the city of Cholula, formerly very important, but which, now fallen from its past splendour, only contains from twelve to fifteen thousand souls. \n \n In the days of the Aztecs, the territory, which now forms the State of Puebla, was considered by the inhabitants a privileged Holy Land, and the sanctuary of the religion. Considerable ruins, very remarkable from an archaeological point of view, still bear witness to the truth of our statement; three principal pyramids exist in a very limited space, without mentioning the ruins on which travellers tread at every step. \n \n Of these three pyramids, one is justly celebrated; it is the one to which the inhabitants of the country give the name of Monte hecho a mano, the mountain built by human hands, or the great teocali of Cholula. \n \n This pyramid, crowned with cypresses, and on the top of which now stands a chapel dedicated to \"Nuestra Se?ora de los remedios,\" is entirely constructed of bricks, its height is one hundred and seventy feet, and its base, according to the calculations of Humboldt, is 1355 feet in length, or a little more than double the base of the pyramids of Cheops. \n \n Monsieur Ampère remarks, with considerable tact and cleverness, that the imagination of the Arabs has surrounded with prodigies, the, to them, unknown cradle of the Egyptian pyramids, whose construction they refer to the deluge; and the same was the case in Mexico. On this subject he relates a tradition picked up in 1566, by Pedro del Río, about the pyramids of Cholula, and preserved in his MSS., which are now in the Vatican. \n \n We will in our turn, make a loan from the celebrated savant, and relate here this tradition, such as he gives it in his Promenades en Amérique. \n \n \"During the last great inundation, the country of Anahuac (the plateau of Mexico), was inhabited by giants. All those who did not perish in this disaster, were changed into fishes, except seven giants who took refuge in the caverns. When the waters began to subside, one of these giants, of the name of Xelhua, who was an architect, erected near Cholula, in memory of the mountain of Tlaloc, which had served as a refuge to him and his brothers, an artificial column of a pyramidal form. The gods, seeing with jealousy, this edifice, whose peak was intended to touch the clouds, and irritated by the audacity of Xelhua, hurled the heavenly fires against the pyramid, whence it happened, that many of the builders perished, and the work could not be completed. It was dedicated to the god of the air, \u0027Qualzalcoatl.\u0027\" \n \n Might we not fancy ourselves reading the Biblical account of the building of the Tower of Babel? \n \n There is in this narrative an error, which must not be imputed to the celebrated professor, but which we, in spite of our humble quality of romance writer, believe it useful to rectify. \n \n Quetzalcoatl—the serpent covered with feathers, the root of which is quetzalli feathers, and coatl serpent, and not qualzalcoatl, which means nothing, and is not even a Mexican name—is the god of the air, the god legislator par excellence; he was white and bearded, his black cloak was studded with red crosses, he appeared at Tula, of which place he was high priest; the men who accompanied him wore black garments, in the shape of a cassock, and like him, were white. \n \n He was passing through Cholula, on his way to the mysterious country whence his ancestors sprang, when the Cholulans implored him to govern them and give them laws; he consented, and remained for twenty years among them. After which, considering his mission temporarily terminated, he went to the mouth of the river Huasacoalco, when he suddenly disappeared, after solemnly promising the Cholulans that he would return one day to govern them. \n \n Hardly a century ago the Indians, when carrying their offspring to the Chapel of the Virgin erected on the pyramid, still prayed to Quetzalcoatl, whose return among them they piously awaited, we will not venture to assert that this belief is completely extinct at the present day. \n \n The pyramid of Cholula in no way resembles those to be seen in Egypt, covered with earth on all sides; it is a thoroughly wooded mount, the top of which can be easily reached, not only on horseback, but in a carriage. \n \n At certain spots landslips had laid bare the sun-dried bricks employed in the construction. \n \n A Christian chapel stands on the top of the pyramid at the very spot where the temple dedicated to Quetzalcoatl was built. \n \n We cannot agree with certain authors who have asserted that a religion of love has been substituted for a barbarous and cruel faith; it would have been more logical to say that a true religion has followed a false one. \n \n Never was the summit of the pyramid of Cholula stained with human blood; never was any man immolated there to the god adored in the temple, now destroyed, for the very simple reason that this temple was dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, and that the only offerings laid on the altar of this god consisted of productions of the earth, such as flowers and the first fruits of the crops, and this was done by the express order of the god legislator, an order which his priests did not dare infringe. \n \n It was about four o\u0027clock, a.m., the stars were beginning to disappear in the depths of the sky, the horizon was striped with large grey bands that incessantly changed their colour, and gradually assumed all the colours of the rainbow, until they at last became blended into one red mass; day was breaking, and the sun was about to rise. At this moment two horsemen issued from Puebla, and proceeded at a sharp trot along the Cholula road. \n \n Both were carefully wrapped up in their sarapes, and appeared well armed. \n \n At about half a league from the town they suddenly turned to the right and entered a narrow path cut through a field of aloes. \n \n This path, which was very badly kept up, like all the means of communication in Mexico, formed numberless turns, and was cut up by so many ravines and quagmires, that there was the greatest difficulty in riding along it, without running the risk of breaking one\u0027s neck twenty times in ten minutes. Here and there came arroyos, which had to be crossed with the water up to the horses\u0027 girths; then there were mounds to ascend and descend; lastly, after at least twenty-five minutes of this difficult riding, the two travellers reached the base of a species of pyramid clumsily made by human hands, entirely covered with wood, and rising about forty feet above the plain. \n \n This artificial hill was crowned by a vaquero\u0027s rancho, which was reached by steps cut at regular distances in the sides of the mound. \n \n On reaching this spot the two strangers halted and dismounted. \n \n The two men then left their horses to themselves, thrust the barrels of their guns into a crevice at the base of the hill, and pressed on them, using the butt as a leverage. \n \n Although the pressure was not greatly exerted, an enormous stone, which seemed completely to adhere to the ground, became slowly detached, turned on invisible hinges, and unmasked the entrance of a cave which ran with a gentle incline underground. \n \n This grotto doubtless received air and light through a great number of imperceptible fissures, for it was dry, and perfectly clear. \n \n \"Go, López,\" said one of the strangers. \n \n \"Are you going up above?\" the other asked. \n \n \"Yes; you will join me there in an hour, unless you see me beforehand.\" \n \n \"Good; that is understood.\" \n \n He then whistled to the horses, which trotted up, and, at a signal from López, entered the cavern without the slightest hesitation. \n \n \"Good-bye for the present,\" said López. \n \n The stranger gave him an affirmative nod; the servant entered in his turn, let the stone fall behind him, and it fitted so exactly into the rock, that there was not the slightest solution of continuity, and it would have been impossible to find the entrance it concealed, even were its existence known, unless one had been acquainted beforehand with its exact position. \n \n The stranger had remained motionless, with his eyes fixed on the surrounding plain, seeking, doubtless, to assure himself that he was really alone, and that he had nothing to fear from indiscreet glances. \n \n When the stone had fallen into its place again, he threw his gun on his shoulder, and began slowly ascending the steps, apparently plunged in gloomy meditation. \n \n From the top of the mound there was a vast prospect: on one side Zapotecas, Cholula, haciendas, and villages; on the other, Puebla, with its numerous painted and conical cupolas, which made it resemble an eastern city. Then the eye wandered over fields of aloes, Indian corn, and agave, in the midst of which the high road to Mexico wound, forming a yellow line. \n \n The stranger remained for an instant pensive, with his eyes turned to the plain, which was completely deserted at this early hour, and which the first sunbeams were beginning to gild with lustrous tints: then, after breathing a suppressed sigh, he pushed the hurdle, covered with a cowhide, which served as door to the rancho, and disappeared in the interior. \n \n The rancho externally had the wretched appearance of a hut almost falling into ruins; still, the interior was more comfortably arranged than might have been reasonably expected in a country where the exigencies of life, with the lower classes more especially, are reduced to what is most strictly necessary. \n \n The first room—for the rancho contained several—served as parlour and sitting room, and communicated with a lean-to outside, used as a kitchen. The whitewashed walls of this room were adorned, not with pictures, but with six or eight of those coloured engravings, manufactured at Epinal, and with which that town inundates the world. They represented different episodes in the wars of the empires, and were decently framed and glazed. In a corner, about six feet from the ground, a statuette, representing Nuestra Se?ora de Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, was placed on a mahogany console, edged with points, on which were fixed yellow wax tapers, three of which were lighted. Six equipales, four butacas, a sideboard covered with various household articles, and a large table placed in the middle of the room, completed the furniture of this apartment, which was lighted by two windows with red curtains. The floor was covered with a mat, of rather delicate workmanship. \n \n We have omitted mention of an article of furniture very important through its rarity, and which was most unexpected in such a place: it was a Black Forest cuckoo clock, surmounted by some bird or other, which announced the hours and half-hours by singing. \n \n This cuckoo was opposite the entrance door, and placed exactly between the two windows. \n \n A door opened on the right into the inner room. \n \n At the moment when the stranger entered the rancho, the room was empty. \n \n He leaned his gun in a corner, took off his hat, which he laid on a table, opened a window, up to which he drew a butaca, then rolled a husk cigarette, which he lit and smoked as calmly and coolly as if he were at home, though not till he had cast a glance at the clock, and muttered— \n \n \"Half past five! Good! I have time: he will not arrive before.\" \n \n While speaking thus to himself, the stranger threw himself back in the butaca; his eyes closed, his hand loosed its hold of the cigarette, and a few minutes later he was sleeping soundly. \n \n His sleep had lasted about half an hour, when a door behind him was cautiously opened, and a pretty woman, twenty-three at the most, with blue eyes and light hair, came into the room stealthily, curiously stretching out her head, and fixing a kind, almost affectionate, glance on the sleeper. \n \n The young woman\u0027s face evidenced gaiety and maliciousness, blended with extreme kindness. Her features, though not regular, formed a coquettish and graceful whole which pleased at the first glance. Her excessively white complexion distinguished her from the other rancheros\u0027 wives, who are generally copper-coloured Indians: her dress was that belonging to her class, but remarkably neat, and worn with a coquettishness that admirably became her. \n \n She thus came up softly to the sleeper, with her head thrown back, and a finger laid on her lip, doubtless to recommend two persons who followed her—a middle-aged man and woman—to make as little noise as possible. \n \n The woman appeared to be about fifty years of age, the man sixty; their rather ordinary features had nothing striking about them, excepting a certain expression of energetic decision spread over them. \n \n The woman wore the garb of Mexican rancheros; as for the man, he was a vaquero. \n \n All three, on coming close to the stranger, stopped before him, and watched him sleeping. \n \n At this moment a sunbeam entered through the open window, and fell on the stranger\u0027s face. \n \n \"Vive Dieu!\" the latter exclaimed in French, as he sprang up suddenly and opened his eyes; \"Why, deuce take me, I really believe I was asleep!\" \n \n \"Parbleu! Mr. Oliver,\" the ranchero replied, in the same language; \"what harm is there in that?\" \n \n \"Ah! There you are, my good friends,\" he said, with a pleasant smile, as he offered them his hand; \"it is a joyous waking for me, since I find you at my side. Good day! Louise, my girl. Good day! Mother Thérèse; and good day to you, too, my old Lo?ck! You have cheerful faces, which it is a pleasure to look at!\" \n \n \"How sorry I am that you woke up, Mr. Oliver,\" the charming Louise said. \n \n \"The more so, because you were doubtless fatigued,\" Lo?ck said. \n \n \"Stuff! I have forgotten it. You did not expect to find me here, eh?\" \n \n \"Pardon me, Mr. Oliver,\" Thérèse replied; \"López informed us of your arrival.\" \n \n \"That confounded López cannot hold his tongue,\" Oliver said, gaily; \"he must always be chattering.\" \n \n \"You will breakfast with us, I hope?\" the young woman asked. \n \n \"Is that a thing to ask, girl?\" the vaquero said; \"I should like to see Mr. Oliver decline, that is all.\" \n \n \"Come, rough one,\" Oliver said, laughingly; \"do not growl. I will breakfast.\" \n \n \"Ah! That is all right,\" the young woman exclaimed. And, aided by Thérèse, who was her mother, as Lo?ck was her father, she instantly began making preparations for the morning meal. \n \n \"But, you know,\" said Oliver, \"nothing Mexican, I do not expect the frightful cooking of the country here.\" \n \n \"All right!\" Louise answered, with a smile; \"We will have a French breakfast.\" \n \n \"Bravo! The news doubles my appetite.\" \n \n While the two women went backwards and forwards from the kitchen to the dining room, preparing the breakfast, and laying the table, the two men remained near the window, and were conversing together. \n \n \"Are you still satisfied?\" Oliver asked his host. \n \n \"Perfectly,\" the other answered. \"Don Andrés de la Cruz is a good master; besides, as you know, I have but few dealings with him.\" \n \n \"That is true. You only depend on ?o Leo Carral.\" \n \n \"I do not complain of him. He is a worthy man, although a majordomo. We get on famously together.\" \n \n \"All the better. I should have been grieved had it been otherwise. However, it was on my recommendation that you consented to take this rancho; and if there were anything—\" \n \n \"I would not hesitate to inform you of it, Mr. Oliver; but in that quarter all goes well.\" \n \n The adventurer looked at him fixedly. \n \n \"Then something is going wrong elsewhere?\" he remarked. \n \n \"I do not say so, sir,\" the vaquero stammered, with embarrassment. \n \n Oliver shook his head. \n \n \"Do you remember, Lo?ck,\" he said to him, sternly, \"the conditions I imposed on you, when I granted you your pardon?\" \n \n \"Oh! I do not forget them, sir.\" \n \n \"You have not spoken?\" \n \n \"No.\" \n \n \"Then Dominique still believes himself—?\" \n \n \"Yes, still,\" he replied hanging his head; \"but he does not love me.\" \n \n \"What makes you suppose so?\" \n \n \"I am only too certain of it, sir: ever since you took him on the prairies, his character has completely changed. The ten years he spent away from me have rendered him completely indifferent.\" \n \n \"Perhaps it is a foreboding,\" the adventurer remarked in a hollow voice. \n \n \"Oh, do not say that, sir,\" the other exclaimed with horror, \"musing is a bad counsellor: I was very guilty, but if you knew how deeply I have repented of my crime—\" \n \n \"I know it and that is the reason why I pardoned you. Justice will be done, some day, on the real culprit.\" \n \n \"Oh, sir, and I tremble, wretch that I am, at having been mixed up in this sinister history, whose denouement will be terrible.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" the adventurer said with concentrated energy—\"very terrible indeed! And you will help in it, Lo?ck.\" \n \n The vaquero gave a sigh, which did not escape the other. \n \n \"I have not seen Dominique,\" he said, with a sudden change of tone; \"is he still asleep?\" \n \n \"Oh no, you have instructed him too well, sir; he is always the first of us to rise.\" \n \n \"How is it that he is not here, in that case?\" \n \n \"Oh,\" the vaquero said with hesitation, \"he has gone out: hang it, he is free, now that he is twenty-two years of age.\" \n \n \"Already!\" the adventurer muttered in a gloomy voice. Then suddenly shaking his head, he said: \n \n \"Let us breakfast.\" \n \n The meal commenced under rather melancholy auspices, but thanks to the efforts of the adventurer, the former gaiety soon returned, and the end of the breakfast was as merry as could be desired. \n \n All at once López suddenly entered the rancho. \n \n \"Se?or Lo?ck,\" he said, \"here is your son: I do not know what he is bringing, but he is on foot and leading his horse by the bridle.\" \n \n All rose and left the rancho. At about a gunshot from the rancho, they really saw a man leading a horse by the bridle: a rather heavy burden was fastened on the animal\u0027s back. \n \n The distance prevented them from distinguishing the nature of this burden. \n \n \"It is strange,\" Oliver muttered in a low voice, after attentively examining the arrival for some moments, \"can it be he? Oh, I must make certain without delay.\" \n \n And, after making López a sign to follow him, he rushed down the steps, to the amazement of the vaquero and the two women who soon saw him running, followed by López, across the plain to meet Dominique. \n \n The latter had noticed the two men and had halted to await their arrival. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773/51674.html","bookId":1112,"book":{"id":1112,"title":"The Rebel Chief","description":"简介： No country in the world offers to the delighted traveller more charming landscapes than Mexico; among them all, that of Las Cumbres or the peak, is, without fear of contradiction, one of the most striking and most agreeably diversified....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
