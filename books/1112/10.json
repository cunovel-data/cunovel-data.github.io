{"id":21965,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. THE MEETING.","content":"Ever since Count de la Saulay\u0027s arrival at the hacienda del Arenal, do?a Dolores had treated him with a degree of reserve which the marriage projects made by the two families were far from justifying. The young lady had not only had no private interviews with the man whom she ought to consider to some extent her betrothed, but had not indulged in the slightest intimacy, or most innocent familiarity; while remaining polite, and even gracious, she had contrived, ever since the first day they met, to raise a barrier between herself and the count—a barrier which he had never attempted to scale, and which had condemned him to remain, perhaps against his secret wishes, within the limits of the strictest reserve. In these conditions, and especially after the scene at which he had been present on the previous evening, we can easily understand what the stupefaction of the young man must be on learning that do?a Dolores requested an interview with him. What could she have to say to him? For what motive did she grant him this meeting? What reason impelled her to act thus? Such were the questions which the count did not cease to ask himself—questions which necessarily remained unanswered. Hence the young man\u0027s anxiety, curiosity, and impatience, were aroused to the highest degree, and it was with a feeling of joy, which he could not fully explain, that he at length heard the hour for the interview strike. Had he been in Paris instead of a Mexican hacienda, he would have certainly known beforehand what he had to expect from the message he had received, and his conduct would have been regulated beforehand. But here the coldness of do?a Dolores toward him—a coldness which had never once thawed—the preference which after the last night\u0027s scene she seemed to give to another person, all combined to deprive this interview of the slightest supposition of love. Was it his renunciation of her hand, and immediate retirement, that do?a Dolores was about to request of him? Singular contradiction of the human mind! The count, who felt for this marriage a repulsion more and more marked, whose formal intention it was to have, as soon as possible, an explanation on this subject with don Andrés de la Cruz, and whose firm resolution it was to withdraw, and renounce the alliance so long prepared, and which displeased him the more because it was forced on him—revolted at the supposition of this renunciation, which, without doubt, do?a Dolores was going to ask him; his wounded self-esteem made him regard this question under a perfectly new light, and the contempt which the young lady seemed to feel for his hand, filled him with shame and anger. He, Count Ludovic de la Saulay, young, handsome, rich, renowned for his wit and elegance, one of the most distinguished members of the jockey club, one of the gods of fashion, whose conquests occupied every mouth in Paris, had produced on a half wild girl no other impression but that of repulsion, had inspired no other feeling but a cold indifference. There was certainly something desperate about this; for an instant he went so far as to fancy—for anger blinded him to such an extent—that he was really in love with his cousin, and he was on the point of swearing to remain deaf to the tears and supplications of do?a Dolores, and insisting on the completion of the marriage within the shortest period possible. But fortunately the pride which had urged him to this determination suddenly suggested to him a more simple, and assuredly more agreeable way to escape from the embarrassment. After taking a complacent glance at his person, a smile of haughty satisfaction lit up his face; he found himself both physically and morally so immeasurably above his surroundings, that he only felt a sort of merciful pity for the poor girl whom the bad education she had received prevented from appreciating the numberless advantages which gave him a superiority over his rivals, or understanding the happiness she would find in an alliance with him. While revolving all these, and many other thoughts, the count left his rooms, crossed the courtyard, and proceeded to the apartments of do?a Dolores. He remarked, though without attaching much importance to the fact, that several saddle horses were waiting in the court, held by peons. At the door of the apartments stood a young Indian girl with pretty face, and sparkling eyes, who greeted him with a smile and a profound courtesy, as she made him a sign to enter. The count followed her; the waiting maid passed through several elegantly furnished rooms, and finally raised a curtain of white China crape, embroidered with large flowers of every hue, and introduced the count, without saying a word, into a delightful boudoir, furnished throughout with China lace. Do?a Dolores, half-reclining on a hammock of aloe fibre, was amusing herself with teasing a pretty parrot half the size of her hand, and was laughing heartily at the little creature\u0027s cries of fury. The young lady was charming, thus: the count had never seen her so lovely. After bowing deeply to her, he stopped in the door, experiencing an admiration mingled with such great stupefaction, that do?a Dolores after looking at him for a moment, could not retain her seriousness, but burst out into a silvery peal of laughter. \"Forgive me, cousin,\" she said to him, \"but you look so singular at this moment, that I could not help—\" \"Laugh, laugh, my fair cousin,\" the young man replied, resolved to share this gaiety which he was so far from expecting, \"I am delighted to find you in such good humour.\" \"Do not stay there, cousin,\" she continued, \"set down here near me in this butaca,\" and with her pink finger she pointed to an armchair. The young man obeyed. \"Cousin,\" he said, \"I have the honour of obeying the invitation which you deigned to send me.\" \"Ah, that is true,\" she answered; \"I thank you for your kindness, and more especially for your punctuality, cousin.\" \"I could not display too great eagerness in obeying you, cousin, I have so rarely the happiness of seeing you.\" \"Is that a reproach you are addressing to me, cousin?\" \"Oh, by no means, Madam. I in no way claim the right of offering you what you are pleased to call reproaches: you are at liberty to act as you please, and to dispose of me.\" \"Oh, oh, my dear cousin, I fancy if I were disposed to make trial of this noble devotion, I should expose myself to shame and you would refuse me point blank.\" \"Now we have it,\" the young man thought and added aloud, \"it is my most sincere desire to please you in everything, cousin. I pledge you my word as a gentleman, and no matter what you may ask of me, I will obey you.\" \"I am much inclined to take you at your word, don Ludovic,\" she said, leaning down to him with a delicious smile. \"Do so, cousin, and you will see from my promptitude in obeying you, that I am the most devoted of your slaves.\" The young lady remained pensive for a moment, then putting back on its rosewood perch the parrot with which she had been playing up till now, she leaped from her hammock, and seated herself a short distance from the count. \"Cousin,\" she said to him, \"I have a service to ask of you.\" \"Of me? At length I shall be of some use to you.\" \"This service,\" she continued, \"is not of great importance in itself.\" \"All the worse.\" \"But I fear, lest it may cause you great annoyance.\" \"What matter, cousin, the annoyance I may experience, if I can be of service to you.\" \"Cousin, I thank you, this is the affair: I must take a rather long ride today, for reasons you will soon appreciate. I cannot and will not be accompanied by any of the inhabitants of the hacienda, whether masters or servants. Still, as the roads are not, at this moment, perfectly secure, and I dare not venture to traverse them alone, I want with me, in order to protect and defend me if necessary, a peon whose presence at my side could not give rise to any malevolent suppositions. I have thought of you as my companion on this expedition. Do you consent, cousin?\" \"With delight: I would merely remark that I am a stranger to this country, and might lose my way on roads I am unacquainted with.\" \"Do not trouble yourself about that, cousin, I am a native of the country, and have no fear about losing my way for fifty leagues round.\" \"If that is the case, cousin, all is for the best: I thank you for the honour you deign to do me, and place myself completely at your disposal.\" \"It is for me to thank you, cousin, for your extreme kindness; the horses are saddled, the Mexican garb becomes you admirably, go and put on your spurs, warn your valet that he will have to accompany you, and fetch your weapons: that is an important point, for you never know what may happen, and come back in ten minutes, when I shall be ready for you.\" The count rose, bowed to the young lady, who responded by a gracious smile, and left the room. \"By Jove,\" he muttered as soon as he was alone, \"this is delightful, and the duty she intends for me is most satisfactory. I fancy I am simply accompanying my delightful cousin to some love appointment. But how was it possible to refuse her anything! I never saw her looking so lovely as today. On my soul, she is a charming fay, and unless I take care, I may end by falling in love with her, unless I have done so already,\" he added with a stifled sigh. He returned to his rooms ordered Raimbaut to get ready to follow him, which the worthy valet did with the punctuality and silence that distinguished him, and after buckling on his heavy silver spurs, and throwing a sarape over his shoulders, he selected a double-barrelled gun, a straight sabre, a brace of revolvers, and thus armed went into the patio. Raimbaut followed his example, had laid in a complete arsenal. The two men were thus, without exaggeration, capable in case of need, to face fifteen bandits. Do?a Dolores, already mounted, was talking with her father while awaiting the count\u0027s arrival. Don Andrés de la Cruz was rubbing his hands in delight, the good understanding between the young people charmed him. \"So you are going to take a ride?\" he said to the count; \"I wish you all possible pleasure.\" \"The se?orita has deigned to offer to accompany her,\" Ludovic answered. \"She has acted admirably, for her choice could not be better.\" While exchanging these few words with his future father-in-law, the count had mounted. \"A pleasant trip,\" continued don Andrés, \"and mind you are careful whom you meet, Juárez\u0027 cuadrillas are beginning to prowl about the neighbourhood, so I have been informed.\" \"Do not be alarmed, papa,\" do?a Dolores replied; \"besides,\" she added with a charming smile aimed at the young man, \"under my cousin\u0027s escort I fear nothing.\" \"Be off then and get back early.\" \"We shall return before the oración, papa.\" Don Andrés gave them a last farewell nod, and they left the hacienda. The count and the young lady galloped side by side. Raimbaut, as a well trained servant, followed a few paces in the rear. \"I will act as your guide, cousin,\" the young lady said, when they had ridden some distance out into the plain and were lost among clumps of liquidambars. \"I could not desire a better one,\" Ludovic answered gallantly. \"Stay, cousin,\" she resumed, giving him a side glance, \"I have a confession to make to you.\" \"A confession, cousin?\" \"Yes, I see you are such a good fellow, that I feel ashamed at having deceived you.\" \"You deceived me, cousin?\" \"Shamefully,\" she said with a laugh, \"as you shall judge. I am leading you to a spot where we are expected.\" \"Where you are expected, you mean.\" \"No, because it is you they want especially to see.\" \"I confess, cousin, that I do not understand you at all: I know no one in this country.\" \"Are you quite sure of that, my dear cousin?\" she asked with a mocking air. \"Well, I believe so at least.\" \"Then, you are beginning to doubt.\" \"You seem so sure of your fact.\" \"I am so, indeed: the person who expects you, not only knows you, but is a friend of yours.\" \"Very good, this makes the matter more puzzling than ever: go on, I beg.\" \"I have but very little to add, besides, in a few minutes we shall have arrived, and I do not wish to keep you in doubt any longer.\" \"That is very kind of you, cousin, I declare. I am humbly waiting till you deign to explain.\" \"I must do so, as your head has such a bad memory. What, sir, you are but a foreigner, who had been but a little while in a strange land. In this country, so soon as you landed, you met one man who displayed some sympathy with you, and you have already forgotten him. Permit me to remark, my dear cousin, that this offers but poor testimony to your constancy.\" \"Crush me, cousin, I deserve all your reproaches. You are right; there is really one man in Mexico for whom I feel a sincere friendship.\" \"Ah! Ah! Then I was not mistaken?\" \"No; but I was so far from supposing that it was to him you alluded, that I confess—\" \"That you no longer remembered him, eh?\" \"On the contrary, cousin; and it would be my most eager desire to see him again.\" \"And what is this person\u0027s name?\" \"He told me it was Oliver; still, I should not like to affirm that it is really his name.\" The young woman gave a meaning smile. \"Would it be indiscreet to ask you why you entertain this unfavourable supposition?\" \"Not at all, cousin; but se?or Oliver appeared to me a very mysterious gentleman; his manners are not those of everybody. As I think, there would be nothing extraordinary if, according to circumstances—\" \"He assumed a name,\" she interrupted. \"Perhaps you are right—perhaps you are wrong—I could not answer that question; all I can tell you is, that he is the person who expects you.\" \"That is singular,\" the young man muttered. \"Why so? He has doubtless an important communication to make to you; at least, so I understood.\" \"Did he tell you so?\" \"Not precisely; but while conversing with me last night he displayed a desire to see you as soon as possible; that is the reason, cousin, why I asked you to accompany me on my ride.\" This confession was made by the young lady in such simple faith that the count was completely staggered by it, and looked at her for a moment as if he did not comprehend her. Do?a Dolores did not notice his astonishment. With her hand placed as a screen over her eyes, she was examining the plain. \"Ah,\" she said a moment after, pointing in a certain direction, \"look at those two men seated side by side in the shade of that clump of trees; one of these is Oliver, the person who expects you. Let us hurry on.\" \"Very good,\" Ludovic answered, spurring his horse. And they galloped toward the two men, who, on perceiving them, had risen to receive them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773/51677.html","bookId":1112,"book":{"id":1112,"title":"The Rebel Chief","description":"简介： No country in the world offers to the delighted traveller more charming landscapes than Mexico; among them all, that of Las Cumbres or the peak, is, without fear of contradiction, one of the most striking and most agreeably diversified....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
