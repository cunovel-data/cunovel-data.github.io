{"id":21986,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI. TRIUMPH.","content":"This unforeseen victory, so brilliant and, complete, gained by Miramón over veteran troops commanded by renowned officers, restored courage and hope to the terrified partizans of the President of the Republic. The temper of the troops changed to such an extent, that they no longer doubted the triumph of their cause, and in a few minutes grew to regard it as definitively gained. Amid the general joy, Miramón alone entertained no illusions as to the value of the victory he had gained. For him this new lustre cast on his armies, which had so long been victorious, was only the last and brilliant flicker of an expiring torch. He was too thoroughly acquainted with the precarious position to which he was reduced, to entertain for a single moment delusive hopes. Still in his heart he thanked fortune for the last smile she had deigned to grant him, and which would prevent him from falling from power like a common man. When the cavalry sent in pursuit of the fugitives, to prevent them from rallying, at length rejoined the main body, which had remained on the field of battle, Miramón, after granting his troops two hours\u0027 rest, gave orders to return to Mexico. \\n\\n \\n\\n The return of the expeditionary force was not nearly so rapid as its preceding march. The tired horses only advanced with difficulty. The infantry had dismounted to escort the prisoners, and thus the cannons and numerous baggage waggons, which had been captured and now followed the army, could only pass along a wide and beaten road, which compelled Miramón to follow the high road and occasioned him a delay of several hours. It was about ten at night when the vanguard of the expeditionary force reached the garitas of Mexico. It was quite dark, and yet the city appeared in the darkness, flashing with an innumerable quantity of lights. \\n\\n \\n\\n Good news, like bad, is propagated with extraordinary rapidity. Let anyone who can solve the almost insoluble problem, but it is certain that the battle was scarce terminated at Toluca, ere its issue was known in Mexico. The rumour of the brilliant success gained by the President immediately ran from mouth to mouth, though no one could tell whence he obtained it. At the news of this unhoped-for victory, the joy was universal, enthusiasm raised to its utmost pitch, and at nightfall the citizens spontaneously illuminated. The ayuntamiento awaited the President at the entrance of the city to offer him their congratulations. The troops marched between two compact lines of people, uttering frenzied shouts, waving handkerchiefs and hats, and letting off any quantity of squibs, in sign of rejoicing. The bells, in spite of the late hour, rang a full peal, and the numerous shovel hats of the clergy mingled with the crowd, proved that the priests and monks, so cold on the previous day for the man who had ever supported them, had suddenly felt their slumbering enthusiasm aroused at the news of his victory. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miramón passed through the crowds, cold and impassive, returning with an imperceptible expression of irony the salutations incessantly made to him on both sides of the road. He dismounted at the palace; a little in front of the gate a man was standing motionless and smiling. This man was the adventurer. On seeing him, Miramón could not restrain a movement of joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, come, come, my friend,\" he exclaimed walking toward him. \\n\\n \\n\\n And, to the general stupefaction, he passed his arm through his and led him into the interior of the palace. When the President reached the private cabinet, in which he usually worked, he threw himself into an easy chair, and wiping with a handkerchief his damp face, he exclaimed with an ill-tempered tone: \"Ouf! I am half dead! This stupid recantation, at which I was forced to be present against my will has, on my honour, wearied me more than all the other events of this day, futile though it was in extraordinary incidents.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good,\" the adventurer replied affectionately. \"I am glad to hear you speak thus, General. I was afraid lest you might be intoxicated by your success.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The general shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you take me for, my friend?\" he answered. \"What a wretched opinion you must have of me, if you suppose that I am a man to let myself be thus blinded by a success which, brilliant though it may appear, is in reality only one victory more to register, while its results will be null for the welfare of the cause I support?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you say is only too true, General.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you fancy I am ignorant of it? My downfall is inevitable: this battle will only retard it for a few days. I must fall, because, in spite of the enthusiastic shouts of the mob—ever fickle and easy to deceive—what has hitherto constituted my strength, and has sustained me in the struggle I undertook, has abandoned me for ever. I feel that the temper of the nation is no longer with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps you go too far, General! Two battles more like this one, and who knows if you will not have regained all you have lost?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My friend, the success of today\u0027s battle belongs to you. It was owing to your brilliant charge in the enemy\u0027s rear, that they were demoralized and consequently conquered.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You insist on seeing everything in gloomy colours. I repeat again: two battles like this one, and you are saved.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"These battles I shall fight, my friend, if they grant me the time, be assured. Ah! If instead of being alone, blockaded in Mexico, I still had faithful lieutenants holding the country, after today\u0027s victory, all might be repaired.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this moment the door of the cabinet was opened, and General Cobos appeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! It is you, my dear General,\" the President said to him, holding out his hand and suddenly reassuming a laughing air. \"You are welcome. What motive procures me the pleasure of seeing you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I implore your Excellency to excuse me for venturing to appear thus, without being announced; but I have to talk with you on serious matters, which admit of no delay.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The adventurer made a movement to withdraw. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stay, I beg of you,\" the President said, checking him by a sign. \"Speak, my dear General.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Excellency, the greatest disorder is prevailing on the Plaza among the people and the troops; the majority are noisily demanding that the officers taken prisoners today, may be immediately shot as traitors to the country.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What?\" the President asked, drawing himself up and turning slightly pale. \"What is that you are saying, my dear General?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If your Excellency will deign to open the windows of this cabinet, you will hear the cries of death which the army and the people are raising in concert.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah!\" Miramón muttered. \"Political assassinations committed in cold blood after the victory: I will never consent to authorize such odious crimes. No, a thousand times no! I at least will never have that said of me. Where are the captured officers?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the interior of the palace, under a guard in the courtyard.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Give orders for them to be at once brought into my presence: go, General.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, my friend,\" the President exclaimed with discouragement, as soon as he found himself alone with the adventurer, \"what can be hoped from a nation so devoid of moral feeling as ours? Alas! What will the European governments think of this apparent barbarity? What a contempt they must feel for our unfortunate nation! And yet,\" he added, \"this people is not bad-hearted, it is its long slavery which has rendered it cruel, and the interminable revolutions to which it has been constantly a victim for forty years. Come, follow me; we must put an end to this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He then left the cabinet accompanied by the adventurer, and entered an immense saloon, in which his most devoted partizans were assembled. The President seated himself in a chair raised on two steps, prepared for him at the end of the room, and the officers who remained faithful to his cause, grouped themselves on either side of him. At an affectionate nod from Miramón the adventurer remained by his side, apparently indifferent. \\n\\n \\n\\n A noise of footsteps and the rattling of arms were heard outside, and the captured officers, preceded by General Cobos, entered the hall. Although they affected calmness, the prisoners were rather anxious as to the fate reserved for them. They had heard the cries of death raised against them, and were aware of the ill feeling of Miramón\u0027s partizans towards them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The one who walked first was General Berriozábal, a young man of thirty at the most, with an expressive head, firm and delicate features, and a noble and easy demeanour. After him came General Degollado between his two sons; then two colonels and the officers composing General Berriozábal\u0027s staff. \\n\\n \\n\\n The prisoners advanced with a firm step toward the President, who on their approach, hastened from his chair and walked a few steps toward them, with a smile on his lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Caballeros,\" he said to them with a graceful bow, \"I regret that the circumstances in which we are now unfortunately placed do not permit me at once to restore you to liberty, but at any rate I will try, by all the means in my power, to render you comfortable during a captivity which, I hope, will not last long. Be good enough first to receive back the swords which you wield so bravely, and of which I regret having deprived you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He made a sign to General Cobos, who hastened to restore to the prisoners the arms which he had taken from them, and which they received with a movement of joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, caballeros,\" the President continued, \"deign to accept the hospitality which I offer you in this palace, where you will be treated with all the respect that your misfortune deserves. I only ask your word as soldiers and caballeros not to leave it without my permission. Not that I doubt your honour, but in order to protect you from the attacks of people ill disposed toward you, and rendered savage by the sufferings of a long war: you are, therefore, prisoners on parole, caballeros, and at liberty to act as you please.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"General,\" Berriozábal answered in the name of all, \"we thank you sincerely for your courtesy, we could not expect less from your well-known generosity. We give you our word, and will only employ the liberty you grant us within the limits you may think proper, promising you to make no attempt to regain our liberty, until you have freed us from our parole.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n After a few more compliments had been exchanged between the President and the two generals, the prisoners withdrew to the apartments assigned to them. At the moment when Miramón was preparing to return to his cabinet, the adventurer quickly checked him, and pointed to a general officer, who was apparently trying to escape notice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know that man?\" he said to him in a low and trembling voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I know him,\" the President answered, \"he only joined me a few days ago, and he has already rendered me eminent services: he is a Spaniard, and his name is don Antonio Cacerbar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! I know his name,\" said the adventurer, \"for I have known him a long time unfortunately: General, that man is a traitor!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nonsense, you are jesting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I repeat, General, that man is a traitor: I am sure of it,\" he said forcibly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I beg you not to press the point, my friend,\" the general quickly interrupted him; \"it would be painful to me; good night, come tomorrow: I wish to talk with you about important matters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And after nodding kindly to him, the President returned to his cabinet, the door of which was closed upon him. The adventurer stood for a moment motionless, painfully affected by the President\u0027s incredulity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh!\" he muttered sadly, \"Those whom God wishes to destroy, he blinds! Alas! All is now over, this man is hopelessly condemned, his cause is lost.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He left the palace full of the most sinister anticipations. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773/51698.html","bookId":1112,"book":{"id":1112,"title":"The Rebel Chief","description":"简介： No country in the world offers to the delighted traveller more charming landscapes than Mexico; among them all, that of Las Cumbres or the peak, is, without fear of contradiction, one of the most striking and most agreeably diversified....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
