{"id":21991,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVI. THE BEGINNING OF THE END.","content":"The few days which had elapsed since his interview with don Jaime, were not wasted by General don Miguel Miramón. Decided on playing a last stake, he had not been willing to risk it till he had as far as possible equalized the advantages, even though he might not have all the chances on his side, so as to render the struggle which, whatever its result might be, must be decisive, more favourable to his projects. \n \n Not only did the President actually employ himself in recruiting and organizing his army and placing it on a respectable footing; but in addition, not heeding for himself how injurious the seizure of the six hundred thousand piastres of the Convention bonds in the House of the Consul of that nation was to him, he made energetic efforts to repair the injury which this stroke had done him, and paved the way for a negotiation, by which he pledged himself to refund in London the money he had so unfortunately taken; while alleging as excuse for this audacious act that it was only intended as reprisals against Mr. Mathew, the Chargé d\u0027Affaires of the British Government, whose incessant machinations and hostile demonstrations against the recognized government of Mexico had placed the President in the critical position in which he now found himself. As a proof of this statement, he declared, as was true, that after the battle of Toluca there had been found among the baggage of General Degollado, who was made prisoner in that affair, a plan for attacking Mexico, written by Mr. Mathew himself—a fact that constituted an act of felony on the part of the representative of a friendly government. \n \n The President, in order to give greater force to this declaration, showed the original of this plan to the foreign ministers residing in Mexico, and then had it translated and published, in the official journal. This publication had produced all the effect the President anticipated from it, and, by increasing the instinctive hatred of the population for the English nation, regained him the sympathies of a few. \n \n Miramón then redoubled his efforts, and, at length succeeded in arming eight thousand men—a very small number against the twenty-four thousand who menaced him—for General Huerta, whose conduct had for some time past been marked with hesitation, at length decided on leaving Morelia at the head of four thousand men, who, joined to the eleven thousand of González Ortega, the five thousand of Gazza Amondia, and the four thousand of Aureliano Carvajal and Cuéllar, formed an effective strength of twenty-four thousand men, who were advanced by forced marches on Mexico, and would speedily appear before the city. The situation became more critical with every moment. The population, ignorant of the President\u0027s plans, were agitated by the most lively terror, expecting at any moment to see the heads of the Juarist columns debouch, and to undergo all the horrors of a siege. \n \n In the meanwhile, Miramón, who was anxious before all not to lose the esteem of his countrymen, and to calm the exaggerated fears of the population, resolved on convoking the ayuntamiento. He then strove, by a speech full of courage, to make these representatives of the population of the capital understand that it had never been his intention to await the enemy behind the walls of the city—that, on the contrary, he had determined to go and attack them in the open country, and that, whatever might be the result of the battle he proposed to fight, the city would have no cause to fear a siege. This assurance slightly calmed the fears of the population, and stopped, as if by enchantment, the tentatives at disorder, and the seditious cries which the hidden partizans of Juárez secretly excited among the groups assembled in the squares, which were constantly stationed there for the last two or three days, and even bivouacked there at night. \n \n When the President believed that he had taken all the prudential measures which circumstances demanded to attack the enemy without too marked a disadvantage, while leaving in the city the requisite forces to keep it in subordination, he assembled a last council of war, to discuss the most suitable plan for surprising and defeating the enemy. This council of war lasted several hours. A number of projects was proposed, some of which, as always happens under such circumstances, were impracticable—and others which, had they been adopted, might possibly have saved the government. \n \n Unfortunately, on this day, General Miramón, usually so sensible and prudent, allowed himself to be carried away by his personal resentment, instead of considering the true interests of the nation. \n \n Don Benito Juárez is a lawyer. We will mention, in passing, that, since the proclamation of Mexican Independence, he is the sole President of the Republic who has not emerged from the ranks of the army, or belonged to the magistracy. Now, Juárez, not being a soldier, could not place himself at the head of his army. Hence, he had temporarily established his residence at Veracruz, which he had made his capital, and appointed don González Ortega Commander-in-Chief, with the most extensive powers as regarded questions of military strategy, trusting entirely to special knowledge and experience for the conduct of the war. But he had completely held back the diplomatic question in his own hands, not wishing that General Ortega, a brave soldier but very bad negotiator, should compromise, by misplaced generosity, the success which he anticipated from his cautious And crafty policy. It was General Ortega by whom Miramón had been defeated at Silao. The resentment at this defeat had remained ever present in the President\u0027s heart: and he felt the most lively desire to wash out the insult he had received on that occasion. Hence, forgetting his habitual prudence, and contrary to the advice of his wisest councillors, he insisted, in the council, that the first attack should be directed against the corps, at the head of which was Ortega. \n \n The motives he alleged in order to have this resolution adopted, though rather specious, were not absolutely deficient in logic. He declared that if he succeeded in defeating Ortega, the Commander-in-Chief, at the head of the largest corps, demoralization would break out in the enemy\u0027s army, and they would have an easy victory over them. The President sustained his opinion with so much eloquence and obstinacy, that he overcame the opposition of the members of the council, and caused the plan he had conceived to be definitively adopted; and once this decision was formed, the general, not wishing to lose a moment in putting it in execution appointed for the morrow a review of all the troops, and fixed the departure for the same day, so as not to let the enthusiasm of his soldiers grow cold. \n \n When the council finally broke up, the President withdrew to his apartments, in order to make his final arrangements, set his affairs in order, and burn certain compromising papers which he did not wish to leave behind him. The President had been shut up in his apartments for some hours; the evening was advanced when the usher on duty announced don Jaime. He at once ordered him to be shown in. The adventurer entered. \n \n \"You will permit me to go on, will you not?\" the President said with a smile; \"I have only a few more papers to arrange, and then I shall have finished.\" \n \n \"Do so, pray, General,\" the adventurer said, seating himself in a butaca. \n \n Miramón resumed his momentarily interrupted occupation. Don Jaime gazed at him for a moment with an expression of indescribable melancholy. \n \n \"So,\" he said, \"your resolution is decidedly formed, General?\" \n \n \"Oh, the dye is cast. I have crossed my Rubicon, I would say, were it not ridiculous for me to compare myself with Caesar. I am going to offer my enemies battle.\" \n \n \"I do not blame that resolution, for it is worthy of you, General. Will you permit me to ask when you propose setting out?\" \n \n \"Tomorrow, immediately after the review I have ordered.\" \n \n \"Good: in that case I have time to send out two or three intelligent scouts, who will inform you of the enemy\u0027s exact position.\" \n \n \"Although several have already started, I gratefully accept your offer, don Jaime.\" \n \n \"Now, be kind enough to tell what direction you intend to follow, and the corps you have resolved to attack.\" \n \n \"I intend to take the bull by the horns; that is to say, González Ortega himself.\" \n \n The adventurer shook his head, but did not venture the slightest observation. He merely said, \"Very good.\" \n \n Miramón left his writing table and sat down by his side. \"There that is finished,\" he said; \"now I am at your service. I guess that you wish to make up some important communication; so speak, don Jaime, I am ready to hear you.\" \n \n \"You are not mistaken, General; I have, indeed, a matter of the utmost importance to communicate to you. Be good enough to read this paper.\" \n \n And he handed the President a folded document. The President took it, read it without displaying the slightest sign of surprise, and then returned it to the adventurer. \"Have you read the signature?\" he said. \n \n \"Yes,\" he replied coldly; \"it is a letter of credit given by don Benito Juárez to don Antonio Cacerbar, recommending the latter to his adherents.\" \n \n \"It is really so, General; you have now no doubts left as to that man\u0027s treachery?\" \n \n \"None.\" \n \n \"Pardon me for asking, General, but what do you intend doing?\" \n \n \"Nothing.\" \n \n \"What, nothing?\" he exclaimed with unaffected surprise. \n \n \"No, I shall do nothing,\" he added. \n \n The adventurer looked stupefied. \n \n \"I do not understand you, Excellency,\" he muttered. \n \n \"Listen to me, don Jaime, and you will understand me,\" the President answered in a gentle and penetrating voice: \"don Francisco Pacheco, ambassador Extraordinary of the Queen of Spain, has rendered me immense services since his arrival in Mexico. After the defeat of Silao, when my position was most precarious, he did not hesitate to recognize my government. Since then he has offered me the best advice, and given the greatest proof of sympathy; his conduct has been so kind toward me, that he has compromised his diplomatic position, and so soon as Juárez obtains the power, he will certainly hand him his passports. Don Pacheco is aware of all this, and yet, at this moment, when I am all but ruined, his conduct remains the same. It is on him alone—I confess it—I reckon to obtain from the enemy, in the probable event of a defeat, good conditions, not for myself, but for the unhappy population of this city, and the persons who, through friendship for me, have been most compromised latterly. Now the man whose treachery you denounce to me—treachery—I hasten to agree with you—so flagrant, that not the slightest doubt can exist about it: this man is not only a Spaniard and the bearer of a great name, but he was also personally recommended to me by the ambassador himself, whose good faith, I feel convinced, has been surprised, and who was the first person deceived in the matter. The principal object of don Pacheco\u0027s mission is, as you cannot be ignorant, to demand satisfaction for the numerous insults offered his countrymen, and reparation for the annoyances to which they have been exposed for some years.\" \n \n \"Yes, General, I am aware of that.\" \n \n \"Good. Now what would the ambassador think were I to arrest on a crime of high treason not only a Spaniard of the highest rank, but also a man whom he recommended to me? Do you suppose he would be pleased, after the numerous services he has already rendered me, and those which he may still be called on to render me, with such conduct on my part? I could, you will say, perhaps, take the letter and discuss the affair confidentially with the ambassador: but, my friend, the insult would be no less grave in that way, as you shall judge. Don Pacheco is the representative of a European government; he belongs to the old school of diplomatists of the beginning of the century: for these two reasons and others I pass over in silence; he holds us poor American diplomatists and governors in but slight estimation, he is so infatuated with his own merit and his superiority over us, that, were I foolish enough to prove to him that he has been deceived by a villain who has played with him with the most daring effrontery, don Pacheco would be furious, not at having been deceived, but because I had unmasked the deceiver: his wounded self-esteem would never forgive me the advantage which chance would gratuitously give me over him, and instead of a useful friend, I should make myself an irreconcilable enemy.\" \n \n \"The reasons you condescend to give me, General, are very good, I allow; but for all that, the man is a traitor.\" \n \n \"That is true, but he is no fool, far from it. If I fight tomorrow and gain the victory, he will remain attached to my fortunes, as he was at Toluca.\" \n \n \"Yes, he will be faithful till he finds a favourable opportunity for ruining you utterly.\" \n \n \"I do not say the contrary; but who knows?—perhaps we shall find, between this and then, the means of getting rid of him without noise or scandal.\" \n \n The adventurer reflected for a moment. \n \n \"Stay, General,\" he said suddenly, \"I believe I have found the means.\" \n \n \"First, allow me to ask you a question, and promise to answer it.\" \n \n \"I do promise.\" \n \n \"You know this man, he is your personal enemy.\" \n \n \"Yes, General,\" he answered frankly. \n \n \"I suspected it: the inveteracy you display in destroying him did not seem to me natural. Now let me hear your plan.\" \n \n \"The sole motive that holds you back, you told me yourself, is the fear of offending the ambassador of her Catholic Majesty.\" \n \n \"It is, indeed, the sole one, don Jaime.\" \n \n \"Well, General, suppose don Pacheco consented to abandon this man?\" \n \n \"Could you succeed in obtaining that?\" \n \n \"I will obtain more, if necessary; I will make him give me a letter, in which he shall not only abandon don Antonio Cacerbar, as he chooses to call himself, but also authorize you to try him.\" \n \n \"Oh, oh! That seems a rather bold statement, don Jaime,\" the President remarked, dubiously. \n \n \"That is my business, General; the main point is, that you shall not be in any way compromised, and remain neutral.\" \n \n \"That is my only desire, and you understand the serious reasons for it?\" \n \n \"I understand them, General, and pledge you my word that your name shall not be even mentioned.\" \n \n \"In my turn, I pledge you my word as a soldier that if you succeed in obtaining this letter, the villain shall be shot in the back in the centre of the Plaza Mayor, even though I had only an hour\u0027s authority left me.\" \n \n \"I hold your pledge, General; besides, I have the blank signature you were kind enough to give me; I will myself arrest the villain when the moment arrives.\" \n \n \"Have you nothing more to say to me?\" \n \n \"Pardon me, General, I have still a request to make.\" \n \n \"What is it?\" \n \n \"General, I wish to accompany you on your expedition.\" \n \n \"I thank you, my friend, and gladly accept.\" \n \n \"I shall have the honour of joining you at the moment when the army sets out.\" \n \n \"I attach you to my staff.\" \n \n \"It is, no doubt, a great favour,\" he answered, with a smile, \"but, unfortunately, it is impossible for me to accept it.\" \n \n \"Why not?\" \n \n \"Because I shall not be alone, General—the three hundred horses who followed me at Toluca will again come with me; but during the battle my cuadrilla and myself will be at your side.\" \n \n \"I give up all idea of comprehending you, my friend; you have the privilege of performing miracles.\" \n \n \"You shall have a proof of that. Now, General, permit me to take leave of you.\" \n \n \"Go, then, my friend, I will keep you no longer.\" \n \n After affectionately pressing the hand which the general offered him, don Jaime withdrew. \n \n López was waiting for him at the palace gate; he mounted his horse, and at once returned home. After writing some letters, which he ordered his peon to deliver at once, don Jaime changed his dress, took certain papers locked up in a bronze casket, assured himself that the hour was not improper (it was hardly ten at night), then went out, and hurried toward the Spanish Embassy, from which he was at no great distance. The ambassador\u0027s door was still open; servants in handsome liveries were moving about the courtyard and vestibule; a porter was standing at the entrance of the zaguán, halberd in hand. \n \n Don Jaime addressed him. The porter called a footman, and made the adventurer a sign to follow this man. On reaching an antechamber, an usher wearing a silver chain round his neck, approached don Jaime, handed him a card, sealed up in an envelope. \n \n \"Deliver this card to his Excellency,\" he said. \n \n At the expiration of a few minutes the usher returned, and throwing open a door, said— \n \n \"His Excellency awaits your lordship.\" \n \n Don Jaime followed him, passed through several rooms, and at length reached the cabinet in which the ambassador was. Don Pacheco advanced a few steps toward him, and bowed graciously. \n \n \"To what happy chance may I attribute your visit, caballero?\" he asked him. \n \n \"I beg your Excellency to excuse me,\" don Jaime replied, with a bow, \"but it was not in my power to select a more convenient hour.\" \n \n \"At whatever hour you may think proper to come, sir, I shall always be delighted to receive you,\" the ambassador made answer. \n \n At a sign from his master the usher drew up a chair, and then retired. The two gentlemen bowed again to each other, and sat down. \n \n \"Now I am ready to listen to you,\" the ambassador said; \"be kind enough to speak, my lord count—\" \n \n \"I implore your Excellency,\" don Jaime eagerly interrupted, \"to permit me to maintain my incognito even toward yourself.\" \n \n \"Very good, sir, I will respect your wishes,\" the ambassador remarked, with a bow. \n \n Don Jaime opened his pocketbook, and took from it a document, which he handed to the ambassador. \n \n \"Will your Excellency,\" he said, \"deign to cast your eyes on this royal order?\" \n \n The ambassador took the order, and began reading it with the most earnest attention; when he had finished he returned the paper to don Jaime, who folded it up and placed it again in his pocketbook. \n \n \"Do you demand the execution of this royal order, caballero?\" the ambassador said. \n \n Don Jaime bowed. \n \n \"Very good,\" don Francisco Pacheco remarked. \n \n He rose, went to his table, wrote a few words on a sheet of paper bearing the arms of Spain and the Embassy stamp, signed it, sealed it, and then handed it open to don Jaime. \n \n \"Here,\" he said, \"is a letter for his Excellency, General Miramón; will you take charge of it, or do you prefer it being sent by the Embassy?\" \n \n \"I will take charge of it, with your Excellency\u0027s permission,\" he replied. \n \n The ambassador folded the letter, put it in an envelope, and then handed it to don Jaime. \"I regret, caballero,\" he said, \"that I am unable to give you any other proofs of my desire to be agreeable to you.\" \n \n \"I have the honour to request your Excellency to accept the expression of my lively gratitude,\" don Jaime answered, with a respectful bow. \n \n \"Shall I not have the pleasure of seeing you again, caballero?\" \n \n \"I shall do myself the honour of coming to pay my respects to your Excellency.\" \n \n The ambassador rang a bell, and the usher made his appearance. The two gentlemen bowed ceremoniously, and don Jaime retired. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773/51703.html","bookId":1112,"book":{"id":1112,"title":"The Rebel Chief","description":"简介： No country in the world offers to the delighted traveller more charming landscapes than Mexico; among them all, that of Las Cumbres or the peak, is, without fear of contradiction, one of the most striking and most agreeably diversified....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
