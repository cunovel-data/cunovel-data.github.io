{"id":21992,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVII. THE LAST BLOW.","content":"On the morrow the sun rose radiantly in floods of gold and purple. Mexico was rejoicing. The city had resumed its festive air; it seemed to have returned to the bright days of calmness and tranquillity: the whole population was in the streets; the motley crowd were hastening with shouts, songs, and laughter to the Paseo de Bucareli. Military bands, drums and fifes, could be heard playing in different directions. Staff officers, dressed in uniforms glistening with gold, and plumed hats, were galloping about to deliver orders. The troops left their barracks, and proceeded toward the Paseo, where they drew up on either side of the great avenue. \\n\\n \\n\\n The artillery took up position in front of the equestrian statue of King Charles IV., whom the leperos insist on confounding with Fernando Cortez, and the cavalry, only eleven hundred strong, were, drawn up on the Alameda. The leperos and boys took advantage of the occasion for rejoicing by discharging firecrackers and squibs between the legs of the loungers. At about ten a.m. loud shouts were heard rapidly drawing nearer the Paseo. The people were greeting the President of the Republic. \\n\\n \\n\\n General Miramón came up in the midst of a brilliant staff. The expression on the President\u0027s face was a glad one, he seemed to be pleased with these shouts of \"Long live Miramón!\" uttered as he passed, and which proved to him that the people still loved him and were displaying, after their fashion, their gratitude for the heroic resolution he had formed of risking a final battle on the open field, instead of awaiting the enemy within the city. The general bowed smilingly to the right and left. When he reached the entrance of the Paseo, twenty pieces of artillery thundered simultaneously, and thus announced his presence to the troops massed on the promenade. Then, rapid orders ran along the ranks, the soldiers fell in, the regimental bands began playing, the bugles sounded, the drums beat, the general passed slowly along the front, and the review began. The soldiers seemed full of ardour, the crowd had communicated their enthusiasm to them, and they shouted, \"Long live Miramón!\" heartily, as the President passed. \\n\\n \\n\\n The inspection held by the general was short and conscientious. It was not one of those reviews which rulers now and then offer the people as an amusement. On leaving the city these troops were going to march straight into action, and the great object was to know whether they were really in a condition to face the foe, whom they would attack a few hours later. The general\u0027s orders had been scrupulously carried out, the troops were well armed, and they had a martial air which it was a pleasure to see. When the President had passed along the ranks, now and then addressing soldiers whom he recognized, or pretended to recognize, an old method which always succeeds, as it flatters the soldier\u0027s self-esteem, he stationed himself in the centre of the Paseo, and ordered several manoeuvres in order to gain an idea of the training of the troops. These manoeuvres, some of which were rather difficult, were executed with very satisfactory precision. The President warmly congratulated the commanding officers, and then the marching pass began; but, after passing in front of the President, the troops resumed their former positions, and established a temporary bivouac. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miramón, not wishing uselessly to fatigue his troops by compelling them to march during the great heat, had resolved not to set out till nightfall. Up to that moment the troops would bivouac on the Paseo. Among the officers who composed the President\u0027s staff, and returned with him to the palace, were don Melchior de la Cruz, don Antonio Cacerbar, and don Jaime. Don Melchior, though he was rather surprised at seeing in military uniform a man whom he had hitherto only known by the name of don Adolfo, and whom he supposed to be engaged in smuggling transactions, saluted him with an ironical smile. Don Jaime duly returned his salute, and got away, as he was not at all desirous of entering into conversation with him. As for don Antonio, as he had never seen don Jaime with his face uncovered, he paid no attention to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n While the President was returning to the palace, don Jaime, who had stopped on the Plaza Mayor, dismounted, and was joined by the count and Dominique, with whom he had made an appointment, though they would not have recognized him, had he not taken the precaution of walking straight up to them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you going with the army?\" they asked him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my friends, I am: but I shall be back here: unfortunately the campaign will not be a long one. During my absence, redouble your vigilance, I implore you: do not let my sister\u0027s house out of sight; one of our enemies will remain in the city.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only one?\" said Dominique. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; but he is the more formidable of the two; the one whose life you so clumsily saved, Dominique.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good; I know him,\" the young man answered, \"he had better look out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And don Melchior?\" the count asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He will not trouble us,\" don Jaime answered, with a singular accent. \"So, my dear friends, watch attentively, and do not allow yourselves to be surprised.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If necessary we will make Leo Carral and our servants help us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That will be more prudent; and perhaps you would act wisely by lodging them in the house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We will attend to that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now let us part, I have business at the palace. Good-bye for the present, my friends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They separated. Don Jaime entered the palace and proceeded to the President\u0027s cabinet. The usher knew him, and raised no difficulty about letting him pass. Miramón was listening to the reports several scouts made him touching the enemy\u0027s movements. Don Jaime sat down and waited patiently till the President had finished his examination. At length the last scout completed his report and withdrew. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" the President said, with a laugh, \"have you seen the ambassador?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly, General. Last night, after leaving you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And the famous letter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here it is,\" he said, handing it to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n The general took the paper with a start of surprise, and rapidly perused it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" don Jaime asked him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We have not only carte blanche?\" he answered; \"But I am even begged to act severely against this man; it is wonderful, on my honour. You have more than carried out my promises. How did you manage it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I simply asked for the letter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are the most mysterious man I know: it is now my turn to fulfil my promise.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is no hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you no longer wish to have him arrested?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On the contrary: but not till our return.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As you please: but what shall we do in the meanwhile?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We will leave him under the orders of the Town Commandant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By Jove, you are right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The President wrote an order, sealed it, and called the usher. \"Is Colonel Cacerbar here?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Excellency.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let him carry this order to the Town Commandant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The usher took the order and went away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is done,\" said the President. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don Jaime remained with the general till the hour for departure. At nightfall, the troops began defiling on the plaza, surrounded by the people, who shouted lustily. When all the troops had passed, the general left the palace, in his turn, with his staff. A large squadron of cavalry was drawn up in the plaza. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whose are those horsemen?\" the general asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My cuadrilla,\" don Jaime answered with a bow. \\n\\n \\n\\n These horsemen, wrapped in long heavy cloaks, and wearing broad brimmed hats, only allowed the end of their beard to be seen. It was in vain that the President examined them, trying to distinguish their faces. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You cannot recognize them,\" don Jaime said to him, in a low voice, \"the beards are false, their dress is in itself a disguise; but, believe me, they will not fight the less bravely in action.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am persuaded of that, and thank you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They set out. Don Jaime raised his sword, the horsemen wheeled and stationed themselves as a rear guard, they were three hundred in number. Differing from the Mexican cavalry, whose favourite weapon is the lance, they were armed with a carbine, the straight sabre of the French chasseur d\u0027Afrique, and pistols in their holsters. At midnight the troops camped, orders were given not to light any bivouac fires. At about three in the morning a scout arrived. He was at once conducted to the President. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, ah! It is you, López?\" the general said, on recognizing him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, General,\" López replied, with a smile to don Jaime, who was seating by the President\u0027s side negligently smoking a cigarette. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What news? Have you heard anything about the enemy?\" Miramón asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, General, and quite fresh.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All the better: where is he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Four leagues from here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good, we shall soon be there then. Which corps is it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That of General don González Ortega.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bravo,\" the President said joyously, \"you are a precious lad: here is something for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He placed several pieces of gold in his hand, \"Give me the details,\" he continued. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"General Ortega is at the head of eleven thousand men, of whom three thousand are cavalry, and thirty-five guns.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you seen them?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I marched with them for more than an hour.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In what temper are they?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, General, they are furious against you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good, rest yourself, you have an hour to sleep.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n López bowed and withdrew. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At last then,\" said Miramón, \"we are going to meet face to face.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How many troops have you, General?\" don Jaime asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Six thousand, of whom eleven hundred are cavalry and twenty guns.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hum,\" said don Jaime, \"against eleven thousand! It is not quite the double my friend, courage will make up for the deficiency.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"May heaven grant it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At four o\u0027clock the camp was raised: López acted; as guide. The troops, shivering with cold, were in a very unsatisfactory temper. At about seven they; halted, the army was drawn up in battle array in a very advantageous position and the guns placed in battery. Don Jaime drew up his horse behind the regular cavalry. Then, all arrangements being made, they breakfasted. At eight o\u0027clock, what the Spaniards call a tiroteo began to be heard: the outposts were falling back before the heads of Ortega\u0027s columns, which were debouching on the battlefield selected by Miramón, and were exchanging shots with them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nothing would have been easier for the President than to avoid the battle, but he did not wish it, as he longed for the end. Miramón was surrounded by his surest lieutenants, Vélez, Cobos, Negrete, Ayestarán and Márquez. On perceiving the enemy he mounted his horse, rode along the ranks of his small army, gave his instructions in a loud sharp voice, strove to communicate to all the valiant ardor that inflated him, and raising his sword in the air, shouted— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Forward!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The battle at once commenced. The Juarist army forced to form under the enemy\u0027s fire, had a marked disadvantage. Miramón\u0027s troops, excited by the example of their young chief, who was only twenty-six years of age, fought like lions and performed prodigies of valour. In vain did the Juarists try to establish themselves in the position they had chosen; they were driven back several times by the vigorous charges of the enemy. In spite of their numerical superiority, the soldiers only advanced inch by inch, and were constantly driven back and broken by the President\u0027s troops. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miramón\u0027s lieutenants, into whom his soul seemed to have passed, placed themselves at the head of the troops, drew them after them, and dashed into the thickest of the fight. One more effort, and the battle was gained, and Ortega forced to retreat. Miramón hurried up. He judged the position with an infallible glance. The moment had arrived to hurl his cavalry on the centre of the Juarists, and break it by a decisive charge. The President shouted: \"charge!\" The cavalry hesitated. Miramón repeated the order. The cavalry set out, but, instead charging, one-half went over to the enemy, and charged with couched lances, the other half that still remained faithful. Demoralized by this sudden desertion, the cavalry who remained faithful turned round, and dispersed in all directions. The infantry, on seeing themselves thus cowardly deserted, fought without energy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Cries of \"treachery, treachery!\" ran along the ranks. In vain did the officers try to lead the soldiers again against the enemy. They were demoralized. Ere long the flight became general. Miramón\u0027s army no longer existed. Ortega was once again the victor but through a shameful treachery at the very moment when he had lost the battle. \\n\\n \\n\\n We have said that don Jaime took up a position with his cuadrilla in the rear of Miramón\u0027s cavalry. Certainly, if three hundred men could have changed the issue of the battle, these brave horsemen would have accomplished the prodigy. Even when the rout was general, they continued fighting with unparalleled obstinacy against the Juarist cavalry, sent in pursuit of the fugitives. Don Jaime had an object in prolonging this unequal combat. As a witness of the unworthy treachery which had caused the loss of the battle, he had seen the officer who was the first to pass over to the enemy with his soldiers. This officer was don Melchior. Don Jaime recognized him, and swore to capture him. The adventurer\u0027s cuadrilla was not composed of common horsemen, as they had already proved and would prove again. In a few hurried words, don Jaime explained his intention. The horsemen uttered a yell of fury, and resolutely charged the enemy. There was a gigantic struggle of three hundred men against three thousand. The cuadrilla entirely disappeared, as if it had been suddenly buried beneath the formidable mass of its adversaries. Then the Juarists began oscillating. Their ranks became loosened. There a gap, and through this gap the cuadrilla passed, carrying off don Melchior in its centre—a prisoner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To the President! To the President!\" don Jaime shouted, as he dashed with his whole band up to Miramón, who was vainly trying to rally a few detachments. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miramón\u0027s lieutenants, who were all his friends, had not abandoned him. They had sworn to die with him. The cuadrilla made a last charge for the purpose of disengaging the general. Then, after taking one despairing glance at the battlefield, Miramón consented to listen to his friends, and retreat. Of his whole army, scarce a thousand men remained to him. The rest were dead, dispersed, or had gone over to the enemy. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first moments of the retreat were terrible. Miramón was suffering from a fearful sorrow, caused not by his defeat, which he had foreseen, but by the cowardly treachery of which he was the victim. When they no longer feared being caught up by the enemy, the President ordered a halt, to enable the horses to breathe. Miramón, leaning against a tree, with folded arms and drooping head, maintained a stern silence, which his generals, standing near him, did not venture to break. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don Jaime advanced, and, stopping two paces from the President, said: \"General!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At the sound of this friendly voice, Miramón raised his head, and offered his hand to the adventurer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it you?\" he said, \"My friend? Oh! Why did I so obstinately refuse to believe you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is done is done, General,\" the adventurer roughly answered. \"We cannot recall it. But, before leaving the spot where we now are, you have a duty to fulfil—an exemplary act of justice to perform.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" he asked with amazement. \\n\\n \\n\\n The other generals drew nearer, no less surprised than he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know why we were defeated?\" the adventurer continued. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because we were betrayed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But do you know the traitor, General?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I do not,\" he said, passionately. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I do. I was there when he carried out his cowardly project, and was watching him; for I had been suspecting him for some time past.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What matter? The villain cannot be reached now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are mistaken, General, for I have brought him to you. I went to fetch him in the midst of his new comrades: and would have gone to the infernal regions to seize him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At these words a quiver of joy ran along the ranks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By Heaven!\" Cobos exclaimed; \"the villain deserves quartering.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bring the man here,\" Miramón said, sadly; for his heart was painfully affected at being forced to act severely; \"he shall be tried.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That will not take long,\" said General Negrete; \"he will meet with the death of traitors—shot from behind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We have only to prove his identity, and have him executed,\" Cobos added. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don Jaime gave a signal, and don Melchior was brought up by two soldiers. He was pale and haggard; his torn clothes were stained with blood and mud: his hands were fastened behind his back. The officers formed a court martial under the presidency of General Cobos. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your name?\" the latter asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don Melchior de la Cruz,\" he replied in a hollow voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you acknowledge that you went over to the enemy, taking your command with you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He made no answer, but his whole body was agitated by a convulsive tremor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The court is certain of this man\u0027s treachery,\" Cobos continued; \"what punishment has he deserved?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That of traitors!\" the officers unanimously replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let it be carried into effect,\" said Cobos. \\n\\n \\n\\n The condemned was forced on his knees. Ten corporals formed a firing party, and placed themselves six paces behind him. \\n\\n \\n\\n General Cobos then approached the condemned man. \"Coward and traitor,\" he said to him, \"you are unworthy of the rank to which you were raised. In the name of all our companions I declare you to be degraded and rejected from our midst.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A soldier then removed the symbols of don Melchior\u0027s rank, and gave him a blow in the face. The young man uttered a tiger\u0027s yell at this insult, looked around him in horror, and made a movement to rise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fire!\" General Cobos shouted. \\n\\n \\n\\n A detonation was heard; the criminal uttered a fearful cry of agony, and fell with his face on the ground, writhing in awful convulsions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Finish him!\" Miramón said, pityingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No!\" Cobos cried, roughly; \"Let him die like a dog. The more he suffers, the more perfect our vengeance will be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Miramón gave a look of disgust, and ordered the boot and saddle to be sounded. The troops set out. Only two men remained with the wretched man, watching him writhe at their feet in atrocious agony. These two men were General Cobos and don Jaime. Don Jaime bent down to him, raised his head, and forcing him to fix his glassy eyes on him, said in a hollow voice— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Parricide! Traitor to your country and your brothers, the latter avenge themselves today. Die, like the dog you are. Your soul will go to the fiend who awaits it, and your body, deprived of sepulture, will be the prey of wild beasts!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mercy!\" the wretch cried, as he fell back. \"Mercy!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A final convulsion agitated his body, his crisped features became hideous; he uttered a horrible yell, and stirred no more. Don Jaime kicked him. He was dead! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One!\" the adventurer said, hoarsely, as he remounted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What?\" asked General Cobos. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing; it is an account I am going over,\" he replied, with a burst of mocking laughter. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773/51704.html","bookId":1112,"book":{"id":1112,"title":"The Rebel Chief","description":"简介： No country in the world offers to the delighted traveller more charming landscapes than Mexico; among them all, that of Las Cumbres or the peak, is, without fear of contradiction, one of the most striking and most agreeably diversified....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
