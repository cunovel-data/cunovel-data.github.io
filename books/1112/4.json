{"id":21959,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. EL RAYO.","content":"At the period when our story takes place, one man in Mexico had the privilege of concentrating on himself the curiosity, fears, and, more than all, the sympathy of all. This man was El Rayo, that is to say, the Thunder. Who was El Rayo? Whence did he come? What did he do? These three questions, short though they were, no one could have answered with certainty. And yet a most extraordinary number of legends was current about him. We will tell in a few words the facts known about him. Toward the close of 1857 he had suddenly appeared on the road that runs from Mexico to Veracruz, the police control of which he undertook in his fashion, stopping convoys and mail coaches, protecting or levying blackmail on the passengers, that is to say, in the second event, obliging the rich to bleed their purses slightly in favour of their companions less favoured than themselves by fortune, and forcing the leaders of escorts to defend the persons they were ordered to accompany against the attacks of the salteadores. No one could have said whether he was young or old, handsome or ugly, brown or fair, for his face had never been seen uncovered. As for his nationality, it is equally impossible to determine, for he spoke with the same facility and elegance Castilian, English, French, German and Italian. This mysterious personage was perfectly well informed about everything that occurred in the territory of the republic; he knew not only the name and social position of the travellers with whom he thought proper to have dealings, but was also acquainted with certain peculiar facts about them which often rendered them very ill at ease. A stranger thing than any we have yet mentioned was, that El Rayo was always alone, and never hesitated to bar the way of his adversaries, no matter what their number might be. We must add that the influence which his presence exercised over the latter was so great, that the mere sight of him sufficed to check any wish of resistance, and that a threat from him made a shudder of terror course through the veins of those whom he addressed. The two presidents of the republic, while carrying on a deadly war to supplant each other, had each separately tried on several occasions to deliver the highway from so troublesome a caballero, who seemed to them a dangerous rival; but all their attempts to obtain this result had failed in a deplorable manner. El Rayo, being put on his guard, no one knew how, and perfectly informed as to the movements of the soldiers sent in search of him, always appeared suddenly before them, foiled their tricks, and compelled them to make a disgraceful retreat. On one occasion, however, the government of Juárez hoped that it was all over with El Rayo, and that he could not escape the measures taken to seize him. It was learned that for some nights past he had been sleeping at a rancho situated a short distance from Paso-del-Macho; a detachment of twenty dragoons, commanded by Carvajal, one of the most cruel and determined guerilleros, was immediately, and with the utmost secrecy, sent to Paso-del-Macho. The commandant had orders to shoot his prisoner so soon as he seized him, doubtless to prevent him from making any attempt to escape while being conveyed from Paso-del-Macho to Veracruz. The detachment, therefore, set out in all haste; the dragoons, to whom a large reward was promised if they succeeded in their awkward expedition, were perfectly prepared to do their duty, as they felt ashamed of having been so long held in check by one man, and were burning to take their revenge at last. The soldiers arrived in sight of the rancho; when about two leagues from El Paso they had met a monk, who, with his hood drawn over his face, and mounted on a sorry mule, was trotting on, and telling his beads. The commandant invited the monk to join his squadron, which offer the monk accepted with some degree of hesitation. At the moment when the detachment, which was marching in rather loose order, reached the rancho, the monk dismounted. \"What are you doing, padre?\" the commandant asked him. \"As you see, my son, I am getting off my mule; business calls me to a rancho a short distance off, and while leaving you to continue your journey, I ask your permission to leave you, while thanking you for the pleasant company you have afforded me since our meeting.\" \"Oh, oh!\" the commandant said, with a coarse laugh, \"That will not do, se?or padre; we cannot separate in that manner.\" \"Why so, my son?\" the monk asked, approaching the officer, though still holding his mule. \"For a very simple reason, my worthy Fray—\" \"Pancracio, at your service, se?or caballero,\" the monk said, with a bow. \"Pancracio—very good,\" the officer continued. \"I want you, or, to speak more correctly, your good offices: in a word, I want you to shrive a man, who is about to die.\" \"Who is it?\" \"Do you know El Rayo, se?or padre?\" \"Santa Virgin! Of course I know him, illustrious commandant.\" \"Well, it is he who is going to die.\" \"Have you arrested him?\" \"Not yet; but in a few minutes it will be done, as I am seeking him.\" \"Nonsense! Where is he, then?\" \"Why, there, in that rancho you can see,\" the officer replied, bending down complacently to the monk, and extending his arm in the direction he indicated to him. \"Are you sure of it, illustrious commandant?\" \"?Caray! Of course I am.\" \"Well, I fancy you are mistaken.\" \"Ah! What do you mean? Do you know anything?\" \"Certainly I know something, for I am El Rayo, accursed ladrón!\" And before the officer, startled at this sudden revelation, which he was so far from expecting, had regained his coolness, El Rayo had seized him by the leg, hurled him on the ground, leaped into his saddle, and drawing two revolvers concealed under his gown, he dashed at full speed upon the detachment, firing with both hands simultaneously, and uttering his terrible war cry—\"El Rayo! El Rayo!\" The soldiers, who were even more surprised than their officer by this rude, and so unexpected attack, disbanded, and fled in all directions. El Rayo, after passing through the whole detachment, of whom he killed seven, and hurled an eighth to the ground with his horse\u0027s chest, suddenly checked the rapid pace of his steed, and after halting for a few minutes a hundred yards off with an air of defiance, seeing that the dragoons did not pursue him—which the poor horrified fellows had no intention of doing, as they only thought of flying, and left their officer in the lurch—he pulled his horse round, and returned to the officer, who was still lying on the ground as if dead. \"Eh, commandant!\" he said to him, as he dismounted, \"Here is your horse; take it back, it will serve you to reform your soldiers; for my part I require it no longer. I am going to wait for you at the rancho, where, if you still have a desire to arrest me, and have me shot, you will find me ready to receive you until eight o\u0027clock tomorrow morning; so good-bye for the present.\" He then waved his hand to him, bestrode his mule, and proceeded to the rancho, which he at once entered. We need not add that he slept peacefully till the morning, and that the officer and soldiers so eager in his pursuit did not dare come to disturb his rest; they had gone back to Veracruz, without once looking round. Such was the man whose unexpected apparition among the escort of the berlin had caused such great terror to the soldiers, and entirely chilled their courage. El Rayo stood for an instant calm, cold, and frowning in the face of the soldiers grouped in front of him, and then said, in a sharp, distinct voice— \"Se?ores, I fancy you have forgotten that no one but myself has the right to give orders on the high roads of the republic. Se?or don Felipe Neri,\" he added, turning to the officer, who was standing motionless a few paces from him, \"you can turn back with your men; the road is perfectly free as far as Puebla—you understand me, I suppose?\" \"I do understand you, caballero; still, I fancy,\" the colonel replied, with some hesitation, \"that my duty orders me to escort—\" \"Not a word more,\" El Rayo interrupted him violently; \"weigh my words carefully, and mind you profit by them; those whom you expected to meet a few paces further on are no longer there; the corpses of several of them are serving as food for the vultures. You have lost the game for today, so take my advice, and turn back.\" The officer again hesitated, and then, urging his horse forward a few yards, he said, in a voice which emotion caused to tremble— \"Se?or, I know not whether you are a man or a demon thus alone to impose your will on brave men; to die is nothing for a soldier when he is struck in the chest when facing the enemy; once already I have recoiled before you, but do not wish to do so again, so kill me today, but do not dishonour me.\" \"I like to hear you speak thus, don Felipe,\" El Rayo coldly answered, \"for bravery becomes a soldier; in spite of your plundering instincts and bandit habits, I see with pleasure that you do not lack courage, and I do not despair of converting you some day, if a bullet does not brutally cut your thread of life, and suddenly arrest your good intentions. Order your soldiers, who are trembling, like the poltroons they are, to fall back a dozen paces, for I am going to give you the satisfaction you desire.\" \"Ah, caballero!\" the officer exclaimed, \"Can it be possible that you consent?\" \"To stake my life against yours?\" El Rayo interrupted him, mockingly—\"Why not? You wish for a lesson, and that lesson you are about to receive.\" Without losing an instant the officer turned his horse and ordered his troopers to fall back, a manoeuvre which they performed with the most praiseworthy eagerness. Don Andrés de la Cruz, for we will now restore him his true name, had looked on with great interest at this scene, in which he had not as yet ventured to interfere. When he saw the turn that matters were taking, he thought it, however, his duty to hazard a few observations. \"Pardon me, caballero,\" he said, addressing the mysterious stranger, \"while sincerely thanking you for your intervention in my favour, permit me to remark that I have been delayed in this defile for a long time already, and that I should like to continue my journey, in order to protect my daughter from danger, as soon as possible.\" \"No danger threatens do?a Dolores, se?or,\" El Rayo coldly answered; \"this delay of only a few minutes cannot possibly have any injurious consequences for her; besides, I wish you to witness this combat, which is to some extent fought in support of your cause, hence I beg you to have patience. But stay, here is don Felipe returning; the affair will not take long. Fancy that you are betting on a cock fight, and I am convinced that you will take pleasure in what is going to happen.\" \"But still—\" don Andrés interposed. \"You would disoblige me by insisting further, caballero,\" El Rayo interrupted him, drily. \"You have, as I know, excellent revolvers which Devismes sent you from Paris; be kind enough to lend one of them to se?or don Felipe. They are loaded, I suppose.\" \"Yes, sir,\" don Andrés replied, offering the officer one of his pistols. The latter took it, turned it over in his hands, and then raised his head with an air of disappointment. \"I do not know how to use these weapons,\" he said. \"Oh, that is very easy,\" El Rayo courteously replied, \"and you will be perfectly acquainted with their mechanism in an instant. Se?or don Andrés, be kind enough to explain to this caballero the very simple management of these weapons.\" The Spaniard obeyed, and the officer at once comprehended the explanation that was given him. \"Now, se?or don Felipe,\" El Rayo resumed, still cold and impassive, \"listen to me attentively. I consent to give you this satisfaction on the condition that whatever the issue of the combat may be, you agree to turn back immediately after, leaving se?or don Andrés and his daughter at liberty to continue their journey if they may think proper: do you agree to this?\" \"Certainly, se?or.\" \"Very good. Now, then, this is what you and I are going to do; so soon as we have dismounted we will station ourselves twenty paces from each other: does that distance suit you?\" \"Perfectly, Excellency.\" \"Good; then at a signal given by me, you will fire the six shots of your revolver; after that I will fire, but only once, as we are in a hurry.\" \"Pardon me, Excellency, but suppose I kill you with these six shots?\" \"You will not kill me, se?or,\" El Rayo answered coldly. \"Do you think so?\" \"I am sure of it; to kill a man of my stamp, se?or don Felipe,\" El Rayo said, with an accent of cutting irony, \"a firm heart and a hand of iron are required: you possess neither.\" Don Felipe made no reply, but devoured by a dull rage, with pale brow and frowning gesture, he resolutely went to place himself twenty paces from his adversary. El Rayo dismounted and placed himself facing the officer, with his head thrown back, his right leg advanced, and his arms folded on his back. \"Now,\" he said, \"pay great attention to aiming true; revolvers, good though they are, generally have the fault of carrying a little too high; do not hurry yourself. Are you ready? Well, then, fire.\" Don Felipe did not let the invitation be repeated, but rapidly fired three shots. \"Too quick—much too quick,\" El Rayo cried to him; \"I did not even hear the whistle of the bullets. Come, be calmer, and try to make good use of the three shots left you.\" All eyes were fixed, all chests were panting. The officer, demoralized by the coolness of his adversary and the ill success of his firing, felt involuntarily fascinated by the black motionless statue before him, whose eyes he could see sparkling like live coals through the holes of the mask; drops of cold perspiration gathered on his hair, which stood erect with horror, and his former assurance had abandoned him. Still, anger and pride gave him the necessary strength to conceal from the spectators the frightful agony he was suffering: by a supreme effort of the will he resumed an apparent calmness, and fired again. \"That is better,\" El Rayo said mockingly, \"but a little too high. Try another.\" Exasperated by this fire, don Felipe pulled the trigger. The bullet struck the rock about an inch above the stranger\u0027s head. Only one bullet was now left in the revolver. \"Advance five paces,\" said El Rayo; \"perhaps you will not then throw away your last chance.\" Without replying to this cutting sarcasm, the officer bounded like a wild beast, stopped at fifteen paces, and fired. \"It is now my turn,\" the stranger said, as he fell back five paces to re-establish the distance; \"you forgot to take your hat off, caballero, and that is a want of courtesy which I cannot tolerate.\" Then drawing one of the pistols thrust through his belt, he cocked it, stretched out his arm and fired without taking the trouble of aiming. The officer\u0027s hat was hurled from his head and rolled in the dust. Don Felipe uttered a howl like a wild beast. \"Oh!\" he exclaimed, \"You are a demon!\" \"No,\" El Rayo answered, \"I am an honest man. Now, begone. I leave you your life.\" \"Yes, I will go; but whether you are man or fiend, I will kill you. I swear it, even if I have to pursue you to the lowest pit of hell.\" El Rayo went up to him, seized him violently by the arm, drew him on one side, and lifting the veil which covered his features, showed him his face. \"You recognize me now, I suppose?\" he said to him in a hollow voice; \"But remember that now you have seen me face to face, our first meeting will be mortal. Begone.\" Don Felipe made no reply; he remounted his horse, placed himself at the head of his terrified soldiers, and started at a gallop along the Orizaba road. Five minutes later only the travellers and their servants remained on the plateau. El Rayo, doubtless taking advantage of the moment of surprise and disorder produced by the close of this scene, had disappeared.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773/51671.html","bookId":1112,"book":{"id":1112,"title":"The Rebel Chief","description":"简介： No country in the world offers to the delighted traveller more charming landscapes than Mexico; among them all, that of Las Cumbres or the peak, is, without fear of contradiction, one of the most striking and most agreeably diversified....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1773","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:22 AM"}}
