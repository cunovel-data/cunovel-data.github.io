I thought gods were just gods.\u0027 \u0027They don\u0027t like it talked about,\u0027 said Cutwell, shuffling through the heap of books and parchments on his worktable. \u0027Well, that might work for gods, because they\u0027re special,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027People are – more solid. It wouldn\u0027t work for people.\u0027 That\u0027s not true. Let\u0027s suppose you went out of here and prowled around the palace. One of the guards would probably see you and he\u0027d think you were a thief and he\u0027d fire his crossbow. I mean, in his reality you\u0027d be a thief. It wouldn\u0027t actually be true but you\u0027d be just as dead as if it was. Belief is powerful stuff. I\u0027m a wizard. We know about these things. Look here.\u0027 He pulled a book out of the debris in front of him and opened it at the piece of bacon he\u0027d used as a bookmark. Mort looked over his shoulder, and frowned at the curly magical writing. It moved around on the page, twisting and writhing in an attempt not to be read by a non-wizard, and the general effect was unpleasant. \u0027What\u0027s this?\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s the Book of the Magick of Alberto Malich the Mage,\u0027 said the wizard, \u0027a sort of book of magical theory. It\u0027s not a good idea to look too hard at the words, they resent it. Look, it says here —\u0027 His lips moved soundlessly. Little beads of sweat sprang up on his forehead and decided to get together and go down and see what his nose was doing. His eyes watered. Some people like to settle down with a good book. No-one in possession of a complete set of marbles would like to settle down with a book of magic, because even the individual words have a private and vindictive life of their own and reading them, in short, is a kind of mental Indian wrestling. Many a young wizard has tried to read a grimoire that is too strong for him, and people who\u0027ve heard the screams have found only his pointy shoes with the classic wisp of smoke coming out of them and a book which is, perhaps, just a little fatter. Things can happen to browsers in magical libraries that make having your face pulled off by tentacled monstrosities from the Dungeon Dimensions seem a mere light massage by comparison. Fortunately Cutwell had an expurgated edition, with some of the more distressing pages clamped shut (although on quiet nights he could hear the imprisoned words scritching irritably inside their prison, like a spider trapped in a matchbox; anyone who has ever sat next to someone wearing a Walkman will be able to imagine exactly what they sounded like). \u0027This is the bit,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027It says here that even gods —\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve seen him before!\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 Mort pointed a shaking finger at the book. \u0027Him!\u0027 Cutwell gave him an odd look and examined the left-hand page. There was a picture of an elderly wizard holding a book and a candlestick in an attitude of near-terminal dignity. \u0027That\u0027s not part of the magic,\u0027 he said testily, \u0027that\u0027s just the author.\u0027 \u0027What does it say under the picture?\u0027 \u0027Er, It says \"Yff youe have enjoyed thiss Boke, youe maye be interestede yn othere Titles by —\u0027 \u0027No, right under the picture is what I meant!\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s easy. It\u0027s old Malich himself. Every wizard knows him. I mean, he founded the University.\u0027 Cutwell chuckled. There\u0027s a famous statue of him in the main hall, and during Rag Week once I climbed up it and put a —\u0027 Mort stared at the picture. \u0027Tell me,\u0027 he said quietly, \u0027did the statue have a drip on the end of its nose?\u0027 \u0027I shouldn\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027It was marble. But I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re getting so worked up about. Lots of people know what he looked like. He\u0027s famous.\u0027 \u0027He lived a long time ago, did he?\u0027 \u0027Two thousand years, I think. Look, I don\u0027t know why —\u0027 \u0027I bet he didn\u0027t die, though,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I bet he just disappeared one day. Did he?\u0027 Cutwell was silent for a moment. \u0027Funny you should say that,\u0027 he said slowly. There was a legend I heard. He got up to some weird things, they say. They say he blew himself into the Dungeon Dimensions while trying to perform the Rite of AshkEnte backwards. All they found was his hat. Tragic, really. The whole city in mourning for a day just for a hat. It wasn\u0027t even a particularly attractive hat; it had burn marks on it.\u0027 \u0027Alberto Malich,\u0027 said Mort, half to himself. \u0027Well. Fancy that.\u0027 He drummed his fingers on the table, although the sound was surprisingly muted. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027I can\u0027t get the hang of treacle sandwiches, either.\u0027 \u0027I reckon the interface is moving at a slow walking pace,\u0027 said Mort, licking his fingers absent-mindedly. \u0027Can\u0027t you stop it by magic?\u0027 Cutwell shook his head. \u0027Not me. It\u0027d squash me flat,\u0027 he said cheerfully. \u0027What\u0027ll happen to you when it arrives, then?\u0027 \u0027Oh, I\u0027ll go back to living in Wall Street. I mean, I never will have left. All this won\u0027t have happened. Pity, though. The cooking here is pretty good, and they do my laundry for free. How far away did you say it was, by the way?\u0027 \u0027About twenty miles, I guess.\u0027. Cutwell rolled his eyes heavenwards and moved his lips. Eventually he said: \u0027That means it\u0027ll arrive around midnight tomorrow, just in time for the coronation.\u0027 \u0027Whose?\u0027 \u0027Hers.\u0027 \u0027But she\u0027s queen already, isn\u0027t she?\u0027 \u0027In a way, but officially she\u0027s not queen until she\u0027s crowned.\u0027 Cutwell grinned, his face a pattern of shade in the candlelight, and added, \u0027If you want a way of thinking about it, then it\u0027s like the difference between stopping living and being dead.\u0027 Twenty minutes earlier Mort had been feeling tired enough to take root. Now he could feel a fizzing in his blood. It was the kind of late-night, frantic energy that you knew you would pay for around midday tomorrow, but for now he felt he had to have some action or else his muscles would snap out of sheer vitality. \u0027I want to see her,\u0027 he said. \u0027If you can\u0027t do anything, there might be something I can do.\u0027 There\u0027s guards outside her room,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027I mention this merely as an observation. I don\u0027t imagine for one minute that they\u0027ll make the slightest difference.\u0027 It was midnight in Ankh-Morpork, but in the great twin city the only difference between night and day was, well, it was darker. The markets were thronged, the spectators were still thickly clustered around the whore pits, runners-up in the city\u0027s eternal and byzantine gang warfare drifted silently down through the chilly waters of the river with lead weights tied to their feet, dealers in various illegal and even illogical delights plied their sidelong trade, burglars burgled, knives flashed starlight in alleyways, astrologers started their day\u0027s work and in the Shades a nightwatch-man who had lost his way rang his bell and cried out: \u0027Twelve o\u0027clock and all\u0027s arrrrrgghhhh, . . .\u0027 However, the Ankh-Morpork Chamber of Commerce would not be happy at the suggestion that the only real difference between their city and a swamp is the number of legs on the alligators, and indeed in the more select areas of Ankh, which tend to be in the hilly districts where there is a chance of a bit of wind, the nights are gentle and scented with habiscine and Cecillia blossoms. On this particular night they were scented with saltpetre, too, because it was the tenth anniversary of the accession of the Patrician[7] and he had invited a few friends round for a drink, five hundred of them in this case, and was letting off fireworks. Laughter and the occasional gurgle of passion filled the palace gardens, and the evening had just got to that interesting stage where everyone had drunk too much for their own good but not enough actually to fall over. It is the kind of state in which one does things that one will recall with crimson shame in later life, such as blowing through a paper squeaker and laughing so much that one is sick. In fact some two hundred of the Patrician\u0027s guests were now staggering and kicking their way through the Serpent Dance, a quaint Morporkian folkway which consisted of getting rather drunk, holding the waist of the person in front, and then wobbling and giggling uproariously in a long crocodile that wound through as many rooms as possible, preferably ones with breakables in, while kicking one leg vaguely in time with the beat, or at least in time with some other beat. This dance had gone on for half an hour and had wound through every room in the palace, picking up two trolls, the cook, the Patrician\u0027s head torturer, three waiters, a burglar who happened to be passing and a small pet swamp dragon. Somewhere around the middle of the dance was fat Lord Rodley of Quirm, heir to the fabulous Quirm estates, whose current preoccupation was with the thin fingers gripping his waist. Under its bath of alcohol his brain kept trying to attract his attention. \u0027I say,\u0027 he called over his shoulder, as they oscillated for the tenth hilarious time through the enormous kitchen, \u0027not so tight, please.\u0027 I AM MOST TERRIBLY SORRY. \u0027No offence, old chap. Do I know you?\u0027 said Lord Rodley, kicking vigorously on the back beat. I THINK IT UNLIKELY. TELL ME, PLEASE, WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS ACTIVITY? \u0027What?\u0027 shouted Lord Rodley, above the sound of someone kicking in the door of a glass cabinet amid shrieks of merriment. WHAT is THIS THING THAT WE DO? said the voice, with glacial patience. \u0027Haven\u0027t you been to a party before? Mind the glass, by the way.\u0027 I AM AFRAID I DO NOT GET OUT AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO. PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS. DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH SEX? \u0027Not unless we pull up sharp, old boy, if you know what I mean?\u0027 said his lordship, and nudged his unseen fellow guest with his elbow. \u0027Ouch,\u0027 he said. A crash up ahead marked the demise of the cold buffet. NO. \u0027What?\u0027 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. \u0027Mind the cream there, it\u0027s slippery – look, it\u0027s just a dance, all right? You do it for fun.\u0027 FUN. \u0027That\u0027s right. Dada, dada, da – kick!\u0027 There was an audible pause. WHO IS THIS FUN? \u0027No, fun isn\u0027t anybody, fun is what you have.\u0027 WE ARE HAVING FUN? \u0027I thought I was,\u0027 said his lordship uncertainly. The voice by his ear was vaguely worrying him; it appeared to be arriving directly into his brain. WHAT is THIS FUN? \u0027This is!\u0027 TO KICK VIGOROUSLY IS FUN? \u0027Well, part of the fun. Kick!\u0027 TO HEAR LOUD MUSIC IN HOT ROOMS IS FUN? \u0027Possibly.\u0027 HOW IS THIS FUN MANIFEST? \u0027Well, it – look, either you\u0027re having fun or you\u0027re not, you don\u0027t have to ask me, you just know, all right? How did you get in here, anyway?\u0027 he added. \u0027Are you a friend of the Patrician?\u0027 LET US SAY, HE PUTS BUSINESS MY WAY. I FELT I OUGHT TO LEARN SOMETHING OF HUMAN PLEASURES. \u0027Sounds like you\u0027ve got a long way to go.\u0027 I KNOW. PLEASE EXCUSE MY LAMENTABLE IGNORANCE. I WISH ONLY TO LEARN. ALL THESE PEOPLE, PLEASE – THEY ARE HAVING FUN? \u0027Yes!\u0027 THEN THIS is FUN. \u0027I\u0027m glad we\u0027ve got that sorted out. Mind the chair,\u0027 snapped Lord Rodley, who was now feeling very unfunny and unpleasantly sober. A voice behind him said quietly: THIS IS FUN. TO DRINK EXCESSIVELY IS FUN. WE ARE HAVING FUN. HE IS HAVING FUN. THIS IS SOME FUN. WHAT FUN. Behind Death the Patrician\u0027s small pet swamp dragon held on grimly to the bony hips and thought: guards or no guards, next time we pass an open window I\u0027m going to run like buggery. Keli sat bolt upright in bed. \u0027Don\u0027t move another step,\u0027 she said. \u0027Guards!\u0027 \u0027We couldn\u0027t stop him,\u0027 said the first guard, poking his head shame-facedly around the doorpost. \u0027He just pushed in . . .\u0027 said the other guard, from the other side of the doorway. \u0027And the wizard said it was all right, and we were told everyone must listen to him because. \u0027All right, all right. People could get murdered around here,\u0027 said Keli testily, and put the crossbow back on the bedside table without, unfortunately, operating the safety catch.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-20.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.
