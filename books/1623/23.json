{"id":95338,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"Steps led down into the velvet gloom. There were cobwebs and dust, and air that smelled as though it had been locked in a pyramid for a thousand years.\\n\\n \u0027People don\u0027t come down here very often,\u0027 said Ysabell. \u0027I\u0027ll lead the way.\u0027\\n\\n Mort felt something was owed.\\n\\n \u0027I must say,\u0027 he said, \u0027you\u0027re a real brick.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You mean pink, square and dumpy? You really know how to talk to a girl, my boy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mort,\u0027 said Mort automatically.\\n\\n The Stack was as dark and silent as a cave deep underground. The shelves were barely far enough apart for one person to walk between them, and towered up well beyond the dome of candlelight. They were particularly eerie because they were silent. There were no more lives to write; the books slept. But Mort felt that they slept like cats, with one eye open. They were aware.\\n\\n \u0027I came down here once,\u0027 said Ysabell, whispering. \u0027If you go far enough along the shelves the books run out and there\u0027s clay tablets and lumps of stone and animal skins and everyone\u0027s called Ug and Zog.\u0027\\n\\n The silence was almost tangible. Mort could feel the books watching them as they tramped through the hot, silent passages. Everyone who had ever lived was here somewhere, right back to the first people that the gods had baked out of mud or whatever. They didn\u0027t exactly resent him, they were just wondering about why he was here.\\n\\n \u0027Did you get past Ug and Zog?\u0027 he hissed. There\u0027s a lot of people would be very interested to know what\u0027s there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I got frightened. It\u0027s a long way and I didn\u0027t have enough candles.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pity.\u0027\\n\\n Ysabell stopped so sharply that Mort cannoned into the back of her.\\n\\n This would be about the right area,\u0027 she said. \u0027What now?\u0027\\n\\n Mort peered at the faded names on the spines.\\n\\n \u0027They don\u0027t seem to be in any order!\u0027 he moaned.\\n\\n They looked up. They wandered down a couple of side alleys. They pulled a few books off the lowest shelves at random, raising pillows of dust.\\n\\n \u0027This is silly,\u0027 said Mort at last. There\u0027s millions of lives here. The chances of finding his are worse than —\u0027\\n\\n Ysabell laid her hand against his mouth.\\n\\n \u0027Listen!\u0027\\n\\n Mort mumbled a bit through her fingers and then got the message. He strained his ears, striving to hear anything above the heavy hiss of absolute silence.\\n\\n And then he found it. A faint, irritable scratching. High, high overhead, somewhere in the impenetrable darkness on the cliff of shelves, a life was still being written.\\n\\n They looked at each other, their eyes widening. Then Ysabell said, \u0027We passed a ladder back there. On wheels.\u0027\\n\\n The little castors on the bottom squeaked as Mort rolled it back. The top end moved too, as if it was fixed to another set of wheels somewhere up in the darkness.\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 he said. \u0027Give me the candle, and —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If the candle\u0027s going up, then so am I,\u0027 said Ysabell firmly. \u0027You stop down here and move the ladder when I say. And don\u0027t argue.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It might be dangerous up there,\u0027 said Mort gallantly.\\n\\n \u0027It might be dangerous down here,\u0027 Ysabell pointed out. \u0027So I\u0027ll be up the ladder with the candle, thank you.\u0027\\n\\n She set her foot on the bottom rung and was soon no more than a frilly shadow outlined in a halo of candlelight that soon began to shrink.\\n\\n Mort steadied the ladder and tried not to think of all the lives pressing in on him. Occasionally a meteor of hot wax would thump into the floor beside him, raising a crater in the dust. Ysabell was now a faint glow far above, and he could feel every footstep as it vibrated down the ladder.\\n\\n She stopped. It seemed to be for quite a long time.\\n\\n Then her voice floated down, deadened by the weight of silence around them.\\n\\n \u0027Mort, I\u0027ve found it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. Bring it down.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mort, you were right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay, thanks. Now bring it down,\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Mort, but which one?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t mess about, that candle won\u0027t last much longer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mort!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mort, there\u0027s a whole shelf!\u0027\\n\\n Now it really was dawn, that cusp of the day that belonged to no-one except the seagulls in Morpork docks, the tide that rolled in up the river, and a warm turnwise wind that added a smell of spring to the complex odour of the city.\\n\\n Death sat on a bollard, looking out to sea. He had decided to stop being drunk. It made his head ache.\\n\\n He\u0027d tried fishing, dancing, gambling and drink, allegedly four of life\u0027s greatest pleasures, and wasn\u0027t sure that he saw the point. Food he was happy with – Death liked a good meal as much as anyone else. He couldn\u0027t think of any other pleasures of the flesh or, rather, he could, but they were, well, fleshy, and he couldn\u0027t see how it would be possible to go about them without some major bodily restructuring, which he wasn\u0027t going to contemplate. Besides, humans seemed to leave off doing them as they grew older, so presumably they couldn\u0027t be that attractive.\\n\\n Death began to feel that he wouldn\u0027t understand people as long as he lived.\\n\\n The sun made the cobbles steam and Death felt the faintest tingling of that little springtime urge that can send a thousand tons of sap pumping through fifty feet of timber in a forest.\\n\\n The seagulls swooped and dived around him. A one-eyed cat, down to its eighth life and its last ear, emerged from its lair in a heap of abandoned fish boxes, stretched, yawned, and rubbed itself against his legs. The breeze, cutting through Ankh\u0027s famous smell, brought a hint of spices and fresh bread.\\n\\n Death was bewildered. He couldn\u0027t fight it. He was actually feeling glad to be alive, and very reluctant to be Death.\\n\\n I MUST BE SICKENING FOR SOMETHING, he thought.\\n\\n Mort eased himself up the ladder alongside Ysabell. It was shaky, but seemed to be safe. At least the height didn\u0027t bother him; everything below was just blackness.\\n\\n Some of Albert\u0027s earlier volumes were very nearly falling apart. He reached out for one at random, feeling the ladder tremble underneath them as he did so, brought it back and opened it somewhere in the middle.\\n\\n \u0027Move the candle this way,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Can you read it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sort of —\u0027\\n\\n — “turnered hys hand, butt was sorelie vexed that alle menne at laste comme to nort, viz. Deathe, and vowed hymme to seke Imortalitie yn his pride. \u0027Thus,\u0027 he tolde the younge wizzerds, \u0027we may take unto ourselfes the mantel of Goddes.\u0027 Thee next day, yt being raining, Alberto” —\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s written in Old,\u0027 he said. \u0027Before they invented spelling. Let\u0027s have a look at the latest one.\u0027\\n\\n It was Albert all right. Mort caught several references to fried bread.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s have a look at what he\u0027s doing now,\u0027 said Ysabell.\\n\\n \u0027Do you think we should? It\u0027s a bit like spying.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what? Scared?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right.\u0027\\n\\n He flicked through until he came to the unfilled pages, and then turned back until he found the story of Albert\u0027s life, crawling across the page at surprising speed considering it was the middle of the night; most biographies didn\u0027t have much to say about sleep, unless the dreams were particularly vivid.\\n\\n \u0027Hold the candle properly, will you? I don\u0027t want to get grease on his life.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why not? He likes grease.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stop giggling, you\u0027ll have us both off. Now look at this bit. . . .\\n\\n — \u0027He crept through the dusty darkness of the Stack —\u0027 Ysabell read – \u0027his eyes fixed on the tiny glow of candlelight high above. Prying, he thought, poking away at things that shouldn\u0027t concern them, the little devils\u0027 —\\n\\n \u0027Mort! He\u0027s —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shut up! I\u0027m reading!\u0027\\n\\n — \u0027soon put a stop to this. Albert crept silently to the foot of the ladder, spat on his hands, and got ready to push. The master\u0027d never know; he was acting strange these days and it was all that lad\u0027s fault, and\u0027 —\\n\\n Mort looked up into Ysabell\u0027s horrified eyes.\\n\\n Then the girl took the book out of Mort\u0027s hand, held it at arm\u0027s length while her gaze remained fixed woodenly on his, and let it go.\\n\\n Mort watched her lips move and then realised that he, too, was counting under his breath.\\n\\n Three, four —\\n\\n There was a dull thump, a muffled cry, and silence.\\n\\n \u0027Do you think you\u0027ve killed him?\u0027 said Mort, after a while.\\n\\n \u0027What, here? Anyway, I didn\u0027t notice any better ideas coming from you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, but – he is an old man, after all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, he\u0027s not,\u0027 said Ysabell sharply, starting down the ladder.\\n\\n \u0027Two thousand years?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not a day over sixty-seven.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The books said —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told you, time doesn\u0027t apply here. Not real time. Don\u0027t you listen, boy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mort,\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027And stop treading on my fingers, I\u0027m going as fast as I can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And don\u0027t act so wet. Have you any idea how boring it is living here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Probably not,\u0027 said Mort, adding with genuine longing, \u0027I\u0027ve heard about boredom but I\u0027ve never had a chance to try it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s dreadful.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If it comes to that, excitement isn\u0027t all it\u0027s cracked up to be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anything\u0027s got to be better than this.\u0027\\n\\n There was a groan from below, and then a stream of swearwords.\\n\\n Ysabell peered into the gloom.\\n\\n \u0027Obviously I didn\u0027t damage his cursing muscles,\u0027 she said. \u0027I don\u0027t think I ought to listen to words like that. It could be bad for my moral fibre.\u0027\\n\\n They found Albert slumped against the foot of the bookshelf, muttering and holding his arm.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no need to make that kind of fuss,\u0027 said Ysabell briskly. \u0027You\u0027re not hurt; father simply doesn\u0027t allow that kind of thing to happen.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What did you have to go and do that for?\u0027 he moaned. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean any harm.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You were going to push us off,\u0027 said Mort, trying to help him up. \u0027I read it. I\u0027m surprised you didn\u0027t use magic.\u0027\\n\\n Albert glared at him.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, so you\u0027ve found out, have you?\u0027 he said quietly. Then much good may it do you. You\u0027ve no right to go prying.\u0027\\n\\n He struggled to his feet, shook off Mort\u0027s hand, and stumbled back along the hushed shelves.\\n\\n \u0027No, wait,\u0027 said Mort, \u0027I need your help!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, of course,\u0027 said Albert over his shoulder. \u0027It stands to reason, doesn\u0027t it? You thought, I\u0027ll just go and pry into someone\u0027s private life and then I\u0027ll drop it on him and then I\u0027ll ask him to help me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I only wanted to find out if you were really you,\u0027 said Mort, running after him.\\n\\n \u0027I am. Everyone is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But if you don\u0027t help me something terrible will happen! There\u0027s this princess, and she —\u0027\\n\\n Terrible things happen all the time, boy —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027— Mort —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027— and no-one expects me to do anything about it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you were the greatest!\u0027\\n\\n Albert stopped for a moment, but did not look around.\\n\\n \u0027Was the greatest, was the greatest. And don\u0027t you try to butter me up. I ain\u0027t butterable.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve got statues to you and everything,\u0027 said Mort, trying not to yawn.\\n\\n \u0027More fool them, then.\u0027 Albert reached the foot of the steps into the library proper, stamped up them and stood outlined against the candlelight from the library.\\n\\n \u0027You mean you won\u0027t help?\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Not even if you can?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Give the boy a prize,\u0027 growled Albert. \u0027And it\u0027s no good thinking you can appeal to my better nature under this here crusty exterior,\u0027 he added, \u0027cos my interior\u0027s pretty damn crusty too.\u0027\\n\\n They heard him cross the library floor as though he had a grudge against it, and slam the door behind him.\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Mort, uncertainly.\\n\\n \u0027What did you expect?\u0027 snapped Ysabell. \u0027He doesn\u0027t care for anyone much except father.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just that I thought someone like him would help if I explained it properly,\u0027 said Mort. He sagged. The rush of energy that had propelled him through the long night had evaporated, filling his mind with lead. \u0027You know he was a famous wizard?\u0027\\n\\n That doesn\u0027t mean anything, wizards aren\u0027t necessarily nice. Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards because a refusal often offends, I read somewhere.\u0027 Ysabell stepped closer to Mort and peered at him with some concern. \u0027You look like something left on a plate,\u0027 she said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-23.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) \\n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \\n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
