{"id":95341,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"An hour ago Cutwell had thumbed through the index of The Monster Fun Grimoire and had cautiously assembled a number of common household ingredients and put a match to them.\n Funny thing about eyebrows, he mused. You never really noticed them until they\u0027d gone.\n Red around the eyes, and smelling slightly of smoke, Cutwell ambled towards the royal apartments past bevies of maids engaged in whatever it was maids did, which always seemed to take at least three of them. Whenever they saw Cutwell they would usually go silent, hurry past with their heads down and then break into muffled giggles along the corridor. This annoyed Cutwell. Not – he told himself quickly – because of any personal considerations, but because wizards ought to be shown more respect. Besides, some of the maids had a way of looking at him which caused him to think distinctly unwizardly thoughts.\n Truly, he thought, the way of enlightenment is like unto half a mile of broken glass.\n He knocked on the door of Keli\u0027s suite. A maid opened it.\n \u0027Is your mistress in?\u0027 he said, as haughtily as he could manage.\n The maid put her hand to her mouth. Her shoulders shook. Her eyes sparkled. A sound like escaping steam crept between her fingers.\n I can\u0027t help it, Cutwell thought, I just seem to have this amazing effect on women.\n \u0027Is it a man?\u0027 came Keli\u0027s voice from within. The maid\u0027s eyes glazed over and she tilted her head, as if not sure of what she had heard.\n \u0027It\u0027s me, Cutwell,\u0027 said Cutwell.\n \u0027Oh, that\u0027s all right, then. You can come in.\u0027\n Cutwell pushed past the girl and tried to ignore the muffled laughter as the maid fled the room. Of course, everyone knew a wizard didn\u0027t need a chaperon. It was just the tone of the princess\u0027s \u0027Oh, that\u0027s all right then\u0027 that made him writhe inside.\n Keli was sitting at her dressing table, brushing her hair. Very few men in the world ever find out what a princess wears under her dresses, and Cutwell joined them with extreme reluctance but with remarkable self-control. Only the frantic bobbing of his adam\u0027s apple betrayed him. There was no doubt about it, he\u0027d be no good for magic for days.\n She turned and he caught a whiff of talcum powder. For weeks, dammit, for weeks.\n \u0027You look a bit hot, Cutwell. Is something the matter?\u0027\n \u0027Naarg.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry?\u0027\n He shook himself. Concentrate on the hairbrush, man, the hairbrush. \u0027Just a bit of magical experimenting, ma\u0027am. Only superficial burns.\u0027\n \u0027Is it still moving?\u0027\n \u0027I am afraid so.\u0027\n Keli turned back to the mirror. Her face was set.\n \u0027Have we got time?\u0027\n This was the bit he\u0027d been dreading. He\u0027d done everything he could. The Royal Astrologer had been sobered up long enough to insist that tomorrow was the only possible day the ceremony could take place, so Cutwell had arranged for it to begin one second after midnight. He\u0027d ruthlessly cut the score of the royal trumpet fanfare. He\u0027d timed the High Priest\u0027s invocation to the gods and then subedited heavily; there was going to be a row when the gods found out. The ceremony of the anointing with sacred oils had been cut to a quick dab behind the ears. Skateboards were an unknown invention on the Disc; if they hadn\u0027t been, Keli\u0027s trip up the aisle would have been unconstitutionally fast. And it still wasn\u0027t enough. He nerved himself.\n \u0027I think possibly not,\u0027 he said. \u0027It could be a very close thing.\u0027\n He saw her glare at him in the mirror.\n \u0027How close?\u0027\n \u0027Um. Very.\u0027\n \u0027Are you trying to say it might reach us at the same time as the ceremony?\u0027\n \u0027Um. More sort of, um, before it,\u0027 said Cutwell wretchedly. There was no sound but the drumming of Keli\u0027s fingers on the edge of the table. Cutwell wondered if she was going to break down, or smash the mirror. Instead she said:\n \u0027How do you know?\u0027\n He wondered if he could get away with saying something like, I\u0027m a wizard, we know these things, but decided against it. The last time he\u0027d said that she\u0027d threatened him with the axe.\n \u0027I asked one of the guards about that inn Mort talked about,\u0027 he said. Then I worked out the approximate distance it had to travel. Mort said it was moving at a slow walking pace, and I reckon his stride is about —\u0027\n \u0027As simple as that? You didn\u0027t use magic?\u0027\n \u0027Only common sense. It\u0027s a lot more reliable in the long run.\u0027\n She reached out and patted his hand.\n \u0027Poor old Cutwell,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027I am only twenty, ma\u0027am.\u0027\n She stood up and walked over to her dressing room. One of the things you learn when you\u0027re a princess is always to be older than anyone of inferior rank.\n \u0027Yes, I suppose there must be such things as young wizards,\u0027 she said over her shoulder. \u0027It\u0027s just that people always think of them as old. I wonder why this is?\u0027\n \u0027Rigours of the calling, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said Cutwell, rolling his eyes. He could hear the rustle of silk.\n \u0027What made you decide to become a wizard?\u0027 Her voice was muffled, as if she had something over her head.\n \u0027It\u0027s indoor work with no heavy lifting,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027And I suppose I wanted to learn how the world worked.\u0027\n \u0027Have you succeeded, then?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027 Cutwell wasn\u0027t much good at small talk, otherwise he\u0027d never have let his mind wander sufficiently to allow him to say: \u0027What made you decide to become a princess?\u0027\n After a thoughtful silence she said, \u0027It was decided for me, you know.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry, I —\u0027\n \u0027Being royal is a sort of family tradition. I expect it\u0027s the same with magic; no doubt your father was a wizard?\u0027\n Cutwell gritted his teeth. \u0027Um. No,\u0027 he said, \u0027not really. Absolutely not, in fact.\u0027\n He knew what she would say next, and here it came, reliable as the sunset, in a voice tinged with amusement and fascination.\n \u0027Oh? Is it really true that wizards aren\u0027t allowed to —\u0027\n \u0027Well, if that\u0027s all I really should be going,\u0027 said Cutwell loudly. \u0027If anyone wants me, just follow the explosions. I – gnnnh!\u0027\n Keli had stepped out of the dressing room.\n Now, women\u0027s clothes were not a subject that preoccupied Cutwell much – in fact, usually when he thought about women his mental pictures seldom included any clothes at all – but the vision in front of him really did take his breath away. Whoever had designed the dress didn\u0027t know when to stop. They\u0027d put lace over the silk, and trimmed it with black vermine, and strung pearls anywhere that looked bare, and puffed and starched the sleeves and then added silver filigree and then started again with the silk.\n In fact it really was amazing what could be done with several ounces of heavy metal, some irritated molluscs, a few dead rodents and a lot of thread wound out of insects\u0027 bottoms. The dress wasn\u0027t so much worn as occupied; if the outlying flounces weren\u0027t supported on wheels, then Keli was stronger than he\u0027d given her credit for.\n \u0027What do you think?\u0027 she said, turning slowly. \u0027This was worn by my mother, and my grandmother, and her mother.\u0027\n \u0027What, all together?\u0027 said Cutwell, quite prepared to believe it. How can she get into it? he wondered. There must be a door round the back. . . .\n \u0027It\u0027s a family heirloom. It\u0027s got real diamonds on the bodice.\u0027\n \u0027Which bit\u0027s the bodice?\u0027\n This bit.\u0027\n Cutwell shuddered. \u0027It\u0027s very impressive,\u0027 he said, when he could trust himself to speak. \u0027You don\u0027t think it\u0027s perhaps a bit mature, though?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s queenly.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but perhaps it won\u0027t allow you to move very fast?\u0027\n \u0027I have no intention of running. There must be dignity.\u0027 Once again the set of her jaw traced the line of her descent all the way to her conquering ancestor, who preferred to move very fast at all times and knew as much about dignity as could be carried on the point of a sharp spear.\n Cutwell spread his hands.\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said. \u0027Fine. We all do what we can. I just hope Mort has come up with some ideas.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s hard to have confidence in a ghost,\u0027 said Keli. \u0027He walks through walls!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve been thinking about that,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027It\u0027s a puzzle, isn\u0027t it? He walks through things only if he doesn\u0027t know he\u0027s doing it. I think it\u0027s an industrial disease.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027I was nearly sure last night. He\u0027s becoming real.\u0027\n \u0027But we\u0027re all real! At least, you are, and I suppose I am.\u0027\n \u0027But he\u0027s becoming more real. Extremely real. Nearly as real as Death, and you don\u0027t get much realler. Not much realler at all.\u0027\n \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 said Albert, suspiciously.\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Ysabell. \u0027Work it out yourself if you like.\u0027\n Albert looked back at the big book, his face a portrait of uncertainty.\n \u0027Well, they could be about right,\u0027 he conceded with bad grace, and copied out the two names on a scrap of paper. There\u0027s one way to find out, anyway.\u0027\n He pulled open the top drawer of Death\u0027s desk and extracted a big iron keyring. There was only one key on it.\n WHAT HAPPENS NOW? said Mort.\n \u0027We\u0027ve got to fetch the lifetimers,\u0027 said Albert. \u0027You have to come with me.\u0027\n \u0027Mort!\u0027 hissed Ysabell.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027What you just said —\u0027 She lapsed into silence, and then added, \u0027Oh, nothing. It just sounded . . . odd.\u0027\n \u0027I only asked what happens now,\u0027 said Mort.\n \u0027Yes, but – oh, never mind:\u0027\n Albert brushed past them and sidled out into the hallway like a two-legged spider until he reached the door that was always kept locked. The key fitted perfectly. The door swung open. There wasn\u0027t so much as a squeak from its hinges, just a swish of deeper silence.\n And the roar of sand.\n Mort and Ysabell stood in the doorway, transfixed, as Albert stamped off between the aisles of glass. The sound didn\u0027t just enter the body via the ears, it came up through the legs and down through the skull and filled up the brain until all that it could think of was the rushing, hissing grey noise, the sound of millions of lives being lived. And rushing towards their inevitable destination.\n They stared up and out at the endless ranks of lifetimers, every one different, every one named. The light from torches ranged along the walls picked highlights off them, so that a star gleamed on every glass. The far walls of the room were lost in the galaxy of light.\n Mort felt Ysabell\u0027s fingers tighten on his arm.\n When she spoke, her voice was strained. \u0027Mort, some of them are so small.\u0027\n I KNOW.\n Her grip relaxed, very gently, like someone putting the top ace on a house of cards and taking their hand away gingerly so as not to bring the whole edifice down.\n \u0027Say that again?\u0027 she said quietly.\n \u0027I said I know. There\u0027s nothing I can do about it. Haven\u0027t you been in here before?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027 She had withdrawn slightly, and was staring at his eyes.\n \u0027It\u0027s no worse than the library,\u0027 said Mort, and almost believed it. But in the library you only read about it; in here you could see it happening.\n \u0027Why are you looking at me like that?\u0027 he added.\n \u0027I was just trying to remember what colour your eyes were,\u0027 she said, \u0027because —\u0027\n \u0027If you two have quite had enough of each other!\u0027 bellowed Albert above the roar of the sand. \u0027This way!\u0027\n \u0027Brown,\u0027 said Mort to Ysabell. \u0027They\u0027re brown. Why?\u0027\n \u0027Hurry up!\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027d better go and help him,\u0027 said Ysabell. \u0027He seems to be getting quite upset.\u0027\n Mort left her, his mind a sudden swamp of uneasiness, and stalked across the tiled floor to where Albert stood impatiently tapping a foot.\n \u0027What do I have to do?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Just follow me.\u0027\n The room opened out into a series of passages, each one lined with the hourglasses. Here and there the shelves were divided by stone pillars inscribed with angular markings. Albert glanced at them occasionally; mainly he strode through the maze of sand as though he knew every turn by heart.\n \u0027Is there one glass for everyone, Albert?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-26.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Mort (Discworld #4) \n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
