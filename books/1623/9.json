The ancient ancestor watched them go with a critical expression, its jowls rhythmically chewing.\\n\\n \u0027That was what they call a demon around here?\u0027 it said. \u0027Offler rot this country of dampness, even their demons are third-rate, not a patch on the demons we had in the Old Country.\u0027\\n\\n The wife placed a small bowl of rice in the folded middle pair of hands of the Offler statue (it would be gone in the morning) and stood back.\\n\\n \u0027Husband did say that last month at the Curry Gardens he served a creature who was not there,\u0027 she said. \u0027He was impressed.\u0027\\n\\n Ten minutes later the man returned and, in solemn silence, placed a small heap of gold coins on the table. They represented enough wealth to purchase quite a large part of the city.\\n\\n \u0027He had a bag of them,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n The family stared at the money for some time. The wife sighed.\\n\\n \u0027Riches bring many problems,\u0027 she said. \u0027What are we to do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We return to Klatch,\u0027 said the husband firmly, \u0027where our children can grow up in a proper country, true to the glorious traditions of our ancient race and men do not need to work as waiters for wicked masters but can stand tall and proud. And we must leave right now, fragrant blossom of the date palm.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why so soon, O hard-working son of the desert?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because,\u0027 said the man, \u0027I have just sold the Patrician\u0027s champion racehorse.\u0027\\n\\n The horse wasn\u0027t as fine or as fast as Binky, but it swept the miles away under its hooves and easily outdistanced a few mounted guards who, for some reason, appeared anxious to talk to Mort. Soon the shanty suburbs of Morpork were left behind and the road ran out into rich black earth country of the Sto plain, constructed over eons by the periodic flooding of the great slow Ankh that brought to the region prosperity, security and chronic arthritis.\\n\\n It was also extremely boring. As the light distilled from silver to gold Mort galloped across a flat, chilly landscape, chequered with cabbage fields from edge to edge. There are many things to be said about cabbages. One may talk at length about their high vitamin content, their vital iron contribution, the valuable roughage and commendable food value. In the mass, however, they lack a certain something; despite their claim to immense nutritional and moral superiority over, say, daffodils, they have never been a sight to inspire the poet\u0027s muse. Unless he was hungry, of course. It was only twenty miles to Sto Lat, but in terms of meaningless human experience it seemed like two thousand.\\n\\n There were guards on the gates of Sto Lat, although compared to the ones that patrolled Ankh they had a sheepish, amateurish look. Mort trotted past and one of them, feeling a bit of a fool, asked him who went there.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t stop,\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n The guard was new to the job, and quite keen. Guarding wasn\u0027t what he\u0027d been led to expect. Standing around all day in chain mail with an axe on a long pole wasn\u0027t what he\u0027d volunteered for; he\u0027d expected excitement and challenge and a crossbow and a uniform that didn\u0027t go rusty in the rain.\\n\\n He stepped forward, ready to defend the city against people who didn\u0027t respect commands given by duly authorised civic employees. Mort considered the pike blade hovering a few inches from his face. There was getting to be too much of this.\\n\\n \u0027On the other hand,\u0027 he said calmly, \u0027how would you like it if I made yon a present of this rather fine horse?\u0027\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t hard to find the entrance to the castle. There were guards there, too, and they had crossbows and a considerably more unsympathetic outlook on life and, in any case, Mort had run out of horses. He loitered a bit until they started paying him a generous amount of attention, and then wandered disconsolately away into the streets of the little city, feeling stupid.\\n\\n After all this, after miles of brassicas and a backside that now felt like a block of wood, he didn\u0027t even know why he was there. So she\u0027d seen him even when he was invisible? Did it mean anything? Of course it didn\u0027t. Only he kept seeing her face, and the flicker of hope in her eyes. He wanted to tell her that everything was going to be all right. He wanted to tell her about himself and everything he wanted to be. He wanted to find out which was her room in the castle and watch it all night until the light went out. And so on.\\n\\n A little later a blacksmith, whose business was in one of the narrow streets that looked out on to the castle walls, glanced up from his work to see a tall, gangling young man, rather red in the face, who kept trying to walk through the walls.\\n\\n Rather later than that a young man with a few superficial bruises on his head called in at one of the city\u0027s taverns and asked for directions to the nearest wizard.\\n\\n And it was later still that Mort turned up outside a peeling plaster house which announced itself on a blackened brass plaque to be the abode of Igneous Cutwell, DM (Unseen), Marster of the Infinit, Illuminartus, Wyzard to Princes, Gardian of the Sacred Portalls, If Out leave Maile with Mrs Nugent Next Door.\\n\\n Suitably impressed despite his pounding heart, Mort lifted the heavy knocker, which was in the shape of a repulsive gargoyle with a heavy iron ring in its mouth, and knocked twice.\\n\\n There was a brief commotion from within, the series of hasty domestic sounds that might, in a less exalted house, have been made by, say, someone shovelling the lunch plates into the sink and tidying the laundry out of sight.\\n\\n Eventually the door swung open, slowly and mysteriously.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027d fbetter pretend to be impreffed,\u0027 said the doorknocker conversationally, but hampered somewhat by the ring. \u0027He does it with pulleys and a bit of ftring. No good at opening-fpells, fee?\u0027\\n\\n Mort looked at the grinning metal face. I work for a skeleton who can walk through walls, he told himself. Who am I to be surprised at anything?\\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re welcome. Wipe your feet on the doormat, it\u0027s the bootfcraper\u0027s day off.\u0027\\n\\n The big low room inside was dark and shadowy and smelled mainly of incense but slightly of boiled cabbage arid elderly laundry and the kind of person who throws all his socks at the wall and wears the ones that don\u0027t stick. There was a large crystal ball with a crack in it, an astrolabe with several bits missing, a rather scuffed octogram on the floor, and a stuffed alligator hanging from the ceiling. A stuffed alligator is absolutely standard equipment in any properly-run magical establishment. This one looked as though it hadn\u0027t enjoyed it much.\\n\\n A bead curtain on the far wall was flung aside with a dramatic gesture and a hooded figure stood revealed.\\n\\n \u0027Beneficent constellations shine on the hour of our meeting!\u0027 it boomed.\\n\\n \u0027Which ones?\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n There was a sudden worried silence.\\n\\n \u0027Pardon?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which constellations would these be?\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027Beneficent ones,\u0027 said the figure, uncertainly. It rallied. \u0027Why do you trouble Igneous Cutwell, Holder of the Eight Keys, Traveller in the Dungeon Dimensions, Supreme Mage of —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Mort, \u0027are you really?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Master of the thingy, Lord High Wossname of the Sacred Dungeons?\u0027\\n\\n Cutwell pushed back his hood with an annoyed flourish. Instead of the grey-bearded mystic Mort had expected he saw a round, rather plump face, pink and white like a pork pie, which it somewhat resembled in other respects. For example, like most pork pies, it didn\u0027t have a beard and, like most pork pies, it looked basically good-humoured.\\n\\n \u0027In a figurative sense,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027What does that mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it means no,\u0027 said Cutwell.\\n\\n \u0027But you said —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That was advertising,\u0027 said the wizard. \u0027It\u0027s a kind of magic I\u0027ve been working on. What was it you were wanting, anyway?\u0027 He leered suggestively. \u0027A love philtre, yes? Something to encourage the young ladies?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is it possible to walk through walls?\u0027 said Mort desperately. Cutwell paused with his hand already halfway to a large bottle full of sticky liquid.\\n\\n \u0027Using magic?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Um,\u0027 said Mort, \u0027I don\u0027t think so.\u0027\\n\\n Then pick very thin walls,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027Better still, use the door. The one over there would be favourite, if you\u0027ve just come here to waste my time.\u0027\\n\\n Mort hesitated, and then put the bag of gold coins on the table. The wizard glanced at them, made a little whinnying noise in the back of his throat, and reached out, Mort\u0027s hand shot across and grabbed his wrist.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve walked through walls,\u0027 he said, slowly and deliberately.\\n\\n \u0027Of course you have, of course you have,\u0027 mumbled Cutwell, not taking his eyes off the bag. He flicked the cork out of the bottle of blue liquid and took an absent-minded swig.\\n\\n \u0027Only before I did it I didn\u0027t know that I could, and when I was doing it I didn\u0027t know I was, and now I\u0027ve done it I can\u0027t remember how it was done. And I want to do it again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because,\u0027 said Mort, \u0027if I could walk through walls I could do anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very deep,\u0027 agreed Cutwell. \u0027Philosophical. And the name of the young lady on the other side of this wall?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s —\u0027 Mort swallowed. \u0027I don\u0027t know her name. Even if there is a girl,\u0027 he added haughtily, \u0027and I\u0027m not saying there is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Cutwell. He took another swig, and shuddered. \u0027Fine. How to walk through walls. I\u0027ll do some research. It might be expensive, though.\u0027\\n\\n Mort carefully picked up the bag and pulled out one small gold coin.\\n\\n \u0027A down payment,\u0027 he said, putting it on the table.\\n\\n Cutwell picked up the coin as if he expected it to go bang or evaporate, and examined it carefully.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve never seen this sort of coin before,\u0027 he said accusingly. \u0027What\u0027s all this curly writing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s gold, though, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I mean, you don\u0027t have to accept it —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure, sure, it\u0027s gold,\u0027 said Cutwell hurriedly. \u0027It\u0027s gold all right. I just wondered where it had come from, that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You wouldn\u0027t believe me,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027What time\u0027s sunset around here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We normally manage to fit it in between night and day,\u0027 said Cutwell, still staring at the coin and taking little sips from the blue bottle. \u0027About now.\u0027\\n\\n Mort glanced out of the window. The street outside already had a twilight look to it.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll be back,\u0027 he muttered, and made for the door. He heard the wizard call out something, but Mort was heading down the street at a dead run.\\n\\n He started to panic. Death would be waiting for him forty miles away. There would be a row. There would be a terrible —\\n\\n AH, BOY.\\n\\n A familiar figure stepped out from the flare around a jellied eel stall, holding a plate of winkles.\\n\\n THE VINEGAR IS PARTICULARLY PIQUANT. HELP YOURSELF, I HAVE AN EXTRA PIN.\\n\\n But, of course, just because he was forty miles away didn\u0027t mean he wasn\u0027t here as well. . . .\\n\\n And in his untidy room Cutwell turned the gold coin over and over in his fingers, muttering \u0027walls\u0027 to himself, and draining the bottle.\\n\\n He appeared to notice what he was doing only when there was no more to drink, at which point his eyes focused on the bottle and, through a rising pink mist, read the label which said \u0027Granny Weatherwax\u0027s Ramrub Invigoratore and Passion\u0027s Philtre, Onne Spoonful Onlie before bed and that Smalle\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027By myself?\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n CERTAINLY. I HAVE EVERY FAITH IN YOU.\\n\\n \u0027Gosh!\u0027\\n\\n The suggestion put everything else out of Mort\u0027s mind, and he was rather surprised to find that he didn\u0027t feel particularly squeamish. He\u0027d seen quite a few deaths in the last week or so, and all the horror went out of it when you knew you\u0027d be speaking to the victim afterwards. Most of them were relieved, one or two of them were angry, but they were all glad of a few helpful words.\\n\\n THINK YOU CAN DO IT?\\n\\n \u0027Well, sir. Yes. I think.\u0027\\n\\n THAT\u0027S THE SPIRIT. I\u0027VE LEFT BlNKY BY THE HORSETROUGH ROUND THE CORNER. TAKE HIM STRAIGHT HOME WHEN YOU\u0027VE FINISHED. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-9.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) \\n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \\n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
