{"id":95317,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Most of the stallkeepers had packed up and gone. Even the hot meat pie man had stopped crying his wares and, with no regard for personal safety, was eating one.\\n\\n The last of Mort\u0027s fellow hopefuls had vanished hours ago. He was a wall-eyed young man with a stoop and a running nose, and Sheepridge\u0027s one licensed beggar had pronounced him to be ideal aterial. The lad on the other side of Mort had gone off to be a toymaker. One by one they had trooped off – the masons, the farriers, the assassins, the mercers, coopers, hoodwinkers and ploughmen. In a few minutes it would be the new year and a hundred boys would be starting out hopefully on their careers, new worthwhile lives of useful service rolling out in front of them.\\n\\n Mort wondered miserably why he hadn\u0027t been picked. He\u0027d tried to look respectable, and had looked all prospective masters squarely in the eye to impress them with his excellent nature and extremely likeable qualities. This didn\u0027t seem to have the right effect.\\n\\n \u0027Would you like a hot meat pie?\u0027 said his father.\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s selling them cheap.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Thank you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh.\u0027\\n\\n Lezek hesitated.\\n\\n \u0027I could ask the man if he wants an apprentice,\u0027 he said, helpfully. \u0027Very reliable, the catering trade.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think he does,\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027No, probably not,\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027Bit of a one-man business, I expect. He\u0027s gone now, anyway. Tell you what, I\u0027ll save you a bit of mine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t actually feel very hungry, dad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s hardly any gristle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. But thanks all the same.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh.\u0027 Lezek deflated a little. He danced about a bit to stamp some life back into his feet, and whistled a few tuneless bars between his teeth. He felt he ought to say something, to offer some kind of advice, to point out that life had its ups and downs, to put his arm around his son\u0027s shoulder and talk expansively about the problems of growing up, to indicate – in short – that the world is a funny old lace where one should never, metaphorically speaking, be so proud as to turn down the offer of a perfectly good hot meat pie.\\n\\n They were alone now. The frost, the last one of the year, tightened its grip on the stones.\\n\\n High in the tower above them a cogged wheel went clonk, tripped a lever, released a ratchet and let a heavy lead weight drop down. There was a dreadful metallic wheezing noise and the trapdoors in the clock face slid open, releasing the clockwork men. Swinging their hammers jerkily, as if they were afflicted with robotic arthritis, they began to ring in the new day.\\n\\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s it,\u0027 said Lezek, hopefully. They\u0027d have to find somewhere to sleep – Hogswatch-night was no time to be walking in the mountains. Perhaps there was a stable somewhere. . . .\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not midnight until the last stroke,\u0027 said Mort, distantly.\\n\\n Lezek shrugged. The sheer strength of Mort\u0027s obstinacy was defeating him.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ll wait, then.\u0027\\n\\n And then they heard the clip-clop of hooves, which boomed rather more loudly around the chilly square than common acoustics should really allow. In fact clip-clop was an astonishingly inaccurate word for the kind of noise which rattled around Mort\u0027s head; clip-clop suggested a rather jolly little pony, quite possibly wearing a straw hat with holes cut out for its ears. An edge to this sound made it very clear that straw hats weren\u0027t an option.\\n\\n The horse entered the square by the Hub road, steam curling off its huge damp white flanks and sparks striking up from the cobbles beneath it. It trotted proudly, like a war charger. It was definitely not wearing a straw hat.\\n\\n The tall figure on its back was wrapped up gainst the cold. When the horse reached the centre of the square the rider dismounted, slowly, and fumbled with something behind the saddle. Eventually he – or she – produced a nosebag, fastened it over the horse\u0027s ears, and gave it a friendly pat on the neck.\\n\\n The air took on a thick, greasy feel, and the deep shadows around Mort became edged with blue and purple rainbows. The rider strode towards him, black cloak billowing and feet making little clicking sounds on the cobbles. They were the only noises – silence clamped down on the square like great drifts of cotton wool.\\n\\n The impressive effect was rather spoilt by a patch of ice.\\n\\n OH, BUGGER.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t exactly a voice. The words were there all right, but they arrived in Mort\u0027s head without bothering to pass through his ears.\\n\\n He rushed forward to help the fallen figure, and found himself grabbing hold of a hand that was nothing more than polished bone, smooth and rather yellowed like an old billiard ball. The figure\u0027s hood fell back, and a naked skull turned its empty eyesockets towards him.\\n\\n Not quite empty, though. Deep within them, as though they were windows looking across the gulfs of space, were two tiny blue stars.\\n\\n It occurred to Mort that he ought to feel horrified, so he was slightly shocked to find that he wasn\u0027t. It was a skeleton sitting in front of him, rubbing its knees and grumbling, but it was a live one, curiously impressive but not, for some strange reason, very f rightening.\\n\\n THANK YOU, BOY, said the skull. WHAT IS YOUR NAME?\\n\\n \u0027Uh,\u0027 said Mort, \u0027Mortimer . . . sir. They call me Mort.\u0027\\n\\n WHAT A COINCIDENCE, said the skull. HELP ME UP, PLEASE.\\n\\n The figure rose unsteadily, brushing itself down. Now Mort could see there was a heavy belt around its waist, from which was slung a white-handled sword.\\n\\n \u0027I hope you are not hurt, sir,\u0027 he said politely.\\n\\n The skull grinned. Of course, Mort thought, it hasn\u0027t much of a choice.\\n\\n NO HARM DONE, I AM SURE. The skull looked around and seemed to see Lezek, who appeared to be frozen to the spot, for the first time. Mort thought an explanation was called for.\\n\\n \u0027My father,\u0027 he said, trying to move protectively in front of Exhibit A without causing any offence. \u0027Excuse me, sir, but are you Death?\u0027\\n\\n CORRECT. FULL MARKS FOR OBSERVATION, THAT BOY.\\n\\n Mort swallowed.\\n\\n \u0027My father is a good man,\u0027 he said. He thought for a while, and added, \u0027Quite good. I\u0027d rather you left him alone, if it\u0027s all the same to you. I don\u0027t know what you have done to him, but I\u0027d like you to stop it. No offence meant.\u0027\\n\\n Death stepped back, his skull on one side.\\n\\n I HAVE MERELY PUT US OUTSIDE TIME FOR A MOMENT, he said. HE WILL SEE AND HEAR NOTHING THAT DISTURBS HIM. NO, BOY, IT WAS YOU I CAME FOR.\\n\\n \u0027Me?\u0027\\n\\n YOU ARE HERE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT?\\n\\n Light dawned on Mort. \u0027You are looking for an apprentice?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n The eyesockets turned towards him, their actinic pinpoints flaring.\\n\\n OF COURSE.\\n\\n Death waved a bony hand. There was a wash of purple light, a sort of visible \u0027pop\u0027, and Lezek unfroze. Above his head the clockwork automatons got on with the job of proclaiming midnight, as Time was allowed to come creeping back.\\n\\n Lezek blinked.\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t see you there for a minute,\u0027 he said. \u0027Sorry – mind must have been elsewhere.\u0027\\n\\n I WAS OFFERING YOUR BOY A POSITION, Said Death. I TRUST THAT MEETS WITH YOUR APPROVAL?\\n\\n \u0027What was your job again?\u0027 said Lezek, talking to a black-robed skeleton without showing even a flicker of surprise.\\n\\n I USHER SOULS INTO THE NEXT WORLD, Said Death.\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Lezek, \u0027of course, sorry, should have guessed from the clothes. Very necessary work, very steady. Established business?\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027HAVE BEEN GOING FOR SOME TIME, YES, said Death.\\n\\n \u0027Good. Good. Never really thought of it as a job for Mort, you know, but it\u0027s good work, good work, always very reliable. What\u0027s your name?\u0027\\n\\n DEATH.\\n\\n \u0027Dad —\u0027 said Mort urgently.\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t say I recognise the firm,\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027Where are you based exactly?\u0027\\n\\n FROM THE UTTERMOST DEPTHS OF THE SEA TO THE HEIGHTS WHERE EVEN THE EAGLE MAY NOT GO, said Death.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s fair enough,\u0027 nodded Lezek. \u0027Well, I —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dad —\u0027 said Mort, pulling at his father\u0027s coat.\\n\\n Death laid a hand on Mort\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n WHAT YOUR FATHER SEES AND HEARS IS NOT WHAT YOU SEE AND HEAR, he said. DO NOT WORRY HIM. DO YOU THINK HE WOULD WANT TO SEE ME – IN THE FLESH, AS IT WERE?\\n\\n \u0027But you\u0027re Death,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027You go around killing people!\u0027\\n\\n I? KILL? said Death, obviously offended. CERTAINLY NOT. PEOPLE GET KILLED, BUT THAT\u0027S THEIR BUSINESS. I JUST TAKE OVER FROM THEN ON. AFTER ALL, IT\u0027D BE A BLOODY STUPID WORLD IF PEOPLE GOT KILLED WITHOUT DYING, WOULDN\u0027T IT?\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes —\u0027 said Mort, doubtfully.\\n\\n Mort had never heard the word \u0027intrigued\u0027. It was not in regular use in the family vocabulary. But a spark in his soul told him that here was something weird and fascinating and not entirely horrible, and that if he let this moment go he\u0027d spend the rest of his life regretting it. And he remembered the humiliations of the day, and the long walk back home. . . .\\n\\n \u0027Er,\u0027 he began, \u0027I don\u0027t have to die to get the job, do I?\u0027\\n\\n BEING DEAD IS NOT COMPULSORY.\\n\\n \u0027And . . . the bones . . .?\u0027\\n\\n NOT IF YOU DON\u0027T WANT TO.\\n\\n Mort breathed out again. It had been starting to prey on his mind.\\n\\n \u0027If father says it\u0027s all right,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n They looked at Lezek, who was scratching his beard.\\n\\n \u0027How do you feel about this, Mort?\u0027 he said, with the brittle brightness of a fever victim. \u0027It\u0027s not everyone\u0027s idea of an occupation. It\u0027s not what I had in mind, I admit. But they do say that undertaking is an honoured profession. It\u0027s your choice.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Undertaking?\u0027 said Mort. Death nodded, and raised his finger to his lips in a conspiratorial gesture.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s interesting,\u0027 said Mort slowly. \u0027I think I\u0027d like to try it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where did you say your business was?\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027Is it far?\u0027\\n\\n NO FURTHER THAN THE THICKNESS OF A SHADOW, aid Death. WHERE THE FIRST PRIMAL CELL WAS, THERE WAS I ALSO. WHERE MAN IS, THERE AM I.\\n\\n WHEN THE LAST LIFE CRAWLS UNDER FREEZING STARS, THERE WILL I BE.\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Lezek, \u0027you get about a bit, then.\u0027 He looked puzzled, like a man struggling to remember something important, and then obviously gave up.\\n\\n Death patted him on the shoulder in a friendly fashion and turned to Mort.\\n\\n HAVE YOU ANY POSSESSIONS, BOY?\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Mort, and then remembered. \u0027Only I think I left them in the shop. Dad, we left the sack in the clothes shop!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027ll be shut,\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027Shops don\u0027t open on Hogswatch Day. You\u0027ll have to go back the day after tomorrow – well, tomorrow now.\u0027\\n\\n IT is OF LITTLE ACCOUNT, said Death. WE WILL LEAVE NOW. NO DOUBT I WILL HAVE BUSINESS HERE SOON ENOUGH.\\n\\n \u0027I hope you\u0027ll be able to drop in and see us soon,\u0027 said Lezek. He seemed to be struggling with his thoughts.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure that will be a good idea,\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027Well, goodbye, lad,\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027You\u0027re to do what you\u0027re told, you understand? And – excuse me, sir, do you have a son?\u0027\\n\\n Death looked rather taken aback.\\n\\n NO, he said, I HAVE NO SONS.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll just have a last word with my boy, if you\u0027ve no objection.\u0027\\n\\n THEN I WILL GO AND SEE TO THE HORSE, said Death, with more than normal tact.\\n\\n Lezek put his arm around his son\u0027s shoulders, with some difficulty in view of their difference in height, and gently propelled him across the square.\\n\\n \u0027Mort, you know your uncle Hemesh told me about this prenticing business?\u0027 he whispered.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, he told me something else,\u0027 the old man confided. \u0027He said it\u0027s not unknown for an apprentice to inherit his master\u0027s business. What do you think of that, then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Uh. I\u0027m not sure,\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s worth thinking about,\u0027 said Lezek.\\n\\n \u0027I am thinking about it, father.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Many a young lad has started out that way, Hemesh said. He makes himself useful, earns his master\u0027s confidence, and, well, if there\u0027s any daughters in the house . . . did Mr, er, Mr say anything about daughters?\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-2.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) \\n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \\n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
