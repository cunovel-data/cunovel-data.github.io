{"id":95342,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\u0027This place doesn\u0027t look big enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you know anything about m-dimensional topography?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Um. No.\u0027\\n\\n Then I shouldn\u0027t aspire to hold any opinions, if I was you,\u0027 said Albert.\\n\\n He paused in front of a shelf of glasses, glanced at the paper again, ran his hand along the row and suddenly snatched up a glass. The top bulb was almost empty.\\n\\n \u0027Hold this,\u0027 he said. \u0027If this is right, then the other should be somewhere near. Ah. Here.\u0027\\n\\n Mort turned the two glasses around in his hands. One had all the markings of an important life, while the other one was squat and quite unremarkable.\\n\\n Mort read the names. The first seemed to refer to a nobleman in the Agatean Empire regions. The second was a collection of pictograms that he recognised as originating in Turnwise Klatch.\\n\\n \u0027Over to you,\u0027 Albert sneered. The sooner you get started, the sooner you\u0027ll be finished. I\u0027ll bring Binky round to the front door.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do my eyes look all right to you?\u0027 said Mort, anxiously.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing wrong with them that I can see,\u0027 said Albert. \u0027Bit red round the edges, bit bluer than usual, nothing special.\u0027\\n\\n Mort followed him back past the long shelves of glass, looking thoughtful. Ysabell watched him take the sword from the rack by the door and test its edge by swishing it through the air, just as Death did, and grinning mirthlessly at the satisfactory sound of the thunderclap.\\n\\n She recognised the walk. He was stalking.\\n\\n \u0027Mort?\u0027 she whispered.\\n\\n YES?\\n\\n \u0027Something\u0027s happening to you.\u0027\\n\\n I KNOW, said Mort. \u0027But I think I can control it.\u0027\\n\\n They heard the sound of hooves outside, and Albert pushed the door open and came in rubbing his hands.\\n\\n \u0027Right, lad, no time to —\u0027\\n\\n Mort swung the sword at arm\u0027s length. It scythed through the air with a noise like ripping silk and buried itself in the doorpost by Albert\u0027s ear.\\n\\n ON YOUR KNEES, ALBERTO MALICH.\\n\\n Albert\u0027s mouth dropped open. His eyes rolled sideways to the shimmering blade a few inches from his head, and then narrowed to tight little lines.\\n\\n \u0027You surely wouldn\u0027t dare, boy,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n MORT. The syllable snapped out as fast as a whiplash and twice as vicious.\\n\\n There was a pact,\u0027 said Albert, but there was the barest gnat-song of doubt in his voice. There was an agreement.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not with me.\u0027\\n\\n There was an agreement! Where would we be if we could not honour an agreement?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know where I would be,\u0027 said Mort softly.\\n\\n BUT I KNOW WHERE YOU WOULD GO. That\u0027s not fair!\u0027 Now it was a whine. THERE\u0027S NO JUSTICE. THERE\u0027S JUST ME.\\n\\n \u0027Stop it,\u0027 said Ysabell. \u0027Mort, you\u0027re being silly. You can\u0027t kill anyone here. Anyway, you don\u0027t really want to kill Albert.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not here. But I could send him back to the world.\u0027\\n\\n Albert went pale.\\n\\n \u0027You wouldn\u0027t!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No? I can take you back and leave you there. I shouldn\u0027t think you\u0027ve got much time left, have you?\u0027 HAVE YOU?\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t talk like that,\u0027 said Albert, quite failing to meet his gaze. \u0027You sound like the master when you talk like that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I could be a lot worse than the master,\u0027 said Mort evenly. \u0027Ysabell, go and get Albert\u0027s book, will you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mort, I really think you\u0027re —\u0027\\n\\n SHALL I ASK YOU AGAIN?\\n\\n She fled from the room, white-faced.\\n\\n Albert squinted at Mort along the length of the sword, and smiled a lop-sided, humourless smile.\\n\\n \u0027You won\u0027t be able to control it forever,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to. I just want to control it for long enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re receptive now, see? The longer the master is away, the more you\u0027ll become just like him. Only it\u0027ll be worse, because you\u0027ll remember all about being human and —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about you, then?\u0027 snapped Mort. \u0027What can you remember about being human? If you went back, how much life have you got left?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ninety-one days, three hours and five minutes,\u0027 said Albert promptly. \u0027I knew he was on my trail, see? But I\u0027m safe here and he\u0027s not such a bad master. Sometimes I don\u0027t know what he\u0027d do without me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, no-one dies in Death\u0027s own kingdom. And you\u0027re pleased with that?\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m more than two thousand years old, I am. I\u0027ve lived longer than anyone in the world.\u0027\\n\\n Mort shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027You haven\u0027t, you know,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ve just stretched things out more. No-one really lives here. The time in this place is just a sham. It\u0027s not real. Nothing changes. I\u0027d rather die and see what happens next than spend eternity here.\u0027\\n\\n Albert pinched his nose reflectively. \u0027Yes, well, you might,\u0027 he conceded, \u0027but I was a wizard, you know. I was pretty good at it. They put up a statue to me, you know. But you don\u0027t live a long life as a wizard without making a few enemies, see, ones who\u0027ll . . . wait on the Other Side.\u0027\\n\\n He sniffed. They ain\u0027t all got two legs, either. Some of them ain\u0027t got legs at all. Or faces. Death don\u0027t frighten me. It\u0027s what comes after.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Help me, then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What good will that do me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One day you might need some friends on the Other Side,\u0027 said Mort. He thought for a few seconds and added, \u0027If I were you, it wouldn\u0027t do any harm to give my soul a bit of a last-minute polish. Some of those waiting for you might not like the taste of that.\u0027\\n\\n Albert shuddered and shut his eyes.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t know about that what you talk about,\u0027 he added, with more feeling than grammar, \u0027else you wouldn\u0027t say that. What do you want from me?\u0027\\n\\n Mort told him.\\n\\n Albert cackled.\\n\\n \u0027Just that? Just change Reality? You can\u0027t. There isn\u0027t any magic strong enough any more. The Great Spells could of done it. Nothing else. And that\u0027s it, so you might as well do as you please and the best of luck to you.\u0027\\n\\n Ysabell came back, a little out of breath, clutching the latest volume of Albert\u0027s life. Albert sniffed again. The tiny drip on the end of his nose fascinated Mort. It was always on the point of dropping off but never had the courage. Just like him, he thought.\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t do anything to me with the book,\u0027 said the old wizard warily.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t intend to. But it strikes me that you don\u0027t get to be a powerful wizard by telling the truth all the time. Ysabell, read out what\u0027s being written.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 “Albert looked at him uncertainly”,\u0027 Ysabell read.\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t believe everything writ down there —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027— “he burst out, knowing in the flinty pit of his heart that Mort certainly could”,\u0027 Ysabell read.\\n\\n \u0027Stop it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 “he shouted, trying to put at the back of his mind the knowledge that even if Reality could not be stopped it might be possible to slow it down a little”.\u0027\\n\\n HOW?\\n\\n \u0027 “intoned Mort in the leaden tones of Death”,\u0027 began Ysabell dutifully.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes, all right, you needn\u0027t bother with my bit,\u0027 snapped Mort irritably.\\n\\n \u0027Pardon me for living, I\u0027m sure.\u0027\\n\\n NO-ONE GETS PARDONED FOR LIVING.\\n\\n \u0027And don\u0027t talk like that to me, thank you. It doesn\u0027t frighten me,\u0027 she said. She glanced down at the book, where the moving line of writing was calling her a liar.\\n\\n Tell me how, wizard,\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027My magic\u0027s all I\u0027ve got left!\u0027 wailed Albert.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t need it, you old miser.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t frighten me, boy —\u0027\\n\\n LOOK INTO MY FACE AND TELL ME THAT.\\n\\n Mort snapped his fingers imperiously. Ysabell bent her head over the book again.\\n\\n \u0027 “Albert looked into the blue glow of those eyes and the last of his defiance drained away”,\u0027 she read, \u0027 “for he saw not just Death but Death with all the human seasonings of vengeance and cruelty and distaste, and with a terrible certainty he knew that this was the last chance and Mort would send him back into Time and hunt him down and take him and deliver him bodily into the dark Dungeon Dimensions where creatures of horror would dot dot dot dot dot”,\u0027 she finished. \u0027It\u0027s just dots for half a page.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s because the book daren\u0027t even mention them,\u0027 whispered Albert. He tried to shut his eyes but the pictures in the darkness behind his eyelids were so vivid that he opened them again. Even Mort was better than that.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said. There is one spell. It slows down time over a little area. I\u0027ll write it down, but you\u0027ll have to find a wizard to say it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can do that.\u0027\\n\\n Albert ran a tongue like an old loofah over his dry lips.\\n\\n There is a price, though,\u0027 he added. \u0027You must complete the Duty first.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ysabell?\u0027 said Mort. She looked at the page in front of her.\\n\\n \u0027He means it,\u0027 she said. \u0027If you don\u0027t then everything will go wrong and he\u0027ll drop back into Time anyway.\u0027\\n\\n All three of them turned to look at the great clock that dominated the hallway. Its pendulum blade sawed slowly through the air, cutting time into little pieces.\\n\\n Mort groaned.\\n\\n \u0027There isn\u0027t enough time!\u0027 he groaned. \u0027I can\u0027t do both of them in time!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The master would have found time,\u0027 observed Albert.\\n\\n Mort wrenched the blade from the doorway and shook it furiously but ineffectually towards Albert, who flinched.\\n\\n \u0027Write down the spell, then,\u0027 he shouted. \u0027And do it fast!\u0027\\n\\n He turned on his heel and stalked back into Death\u0027s study. There was a large disc of the world in one corner, complete down to solid silver elephants standing on the back of a Great A\u0027Tuin cast in bronze and more than a metre long. The great rivers were represented by veins of jade, the deserts by powdered diamond and the most notable cities were picked out in precious stones; Ankh-Morpork, for instance, was a carbuncle.\\n\\n He plonked the two glasses down at the approximate locations of their owners and flopped down in Death\u0027s chair, glaring at them, willing them to be closer together. The chair squeaked gently as he swivelled from side to side, glowering at the little disc.\\n\\n After a while Ysabell came in, treading softly.\\n\\n \u0027Albert\u0027s written it down,\u0027 she said quietly, \u0027I\u0027ve checked the book. It isn\u0027t a trick. He\u0027s gone and locked himself in his room now and —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look at these two! I mean, will you look at them!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think you should calm down a bit, Mort.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How can I calm down with, look, this one over here almost in the Great Nef, and this one right in Bes Pelargic and then I\u0027ve got to get back to Sto Lat. That\u0027s a ten thousand mile round trip however you look at it. It can\u0027t be done.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll find a way. And I\u0027ll help.\u0027\\n\\n He looked at her for the first time and saw she was wearing her outdoor coat, the unsuitable one with the big fur collar.\\n\\n \u0027You? What could you do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Binky can easily carry two,\u0027 said Ysabell meekly. She waved a paper package vaguely. \u0027I\u0027ve packed us something to eat. I could – hold open doors and things.\u0027\\n\\n Mort laughed mirthlessly. THAT WON\u0027T BE NECESSARY.\\n\\n \u0027I wish you\u0027d stop talking like that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t take passengers. You\u0027ll slow me down.\u0027\\n\\n Ysabell sighed. \u0027Look, how about this? Let\u0027s pretend we\u0027ve had the row and I\u0027ve won. See? It saves a lot of effort. I actually think you might find Binky rather reluctant to go if I\u0027m not there. I\u0027ve fed him an awful lot of sugar lumps over the years. Now – are we going?\u0027\\n\\n Albert sat on his narrow bed, glowering at the wall. He heard the sound of hoofbeats, abruptly cut off as Binky got airborne, and muttered under his breath.\\n\\n Twenty minutes passed. Expressions flitted across the old wizard\u0027s face like cloud shadows across a hillside. Occasionally he\u0027d whisper something to himself, like \u0027I told \u0027em\u0027 or \u0027Never would of stood for it\u0027 or The master ought to be tole\u0027.\\n\\n Eventually he seemed to reach an agreement with himself, knelt down gingerly and pulled a battered trunk from under his bed. He opened it with difficulty and unfolded a dusty grey robe that scattered mothballs and tarnished sequins across the floor. He pulled it on, brushed off the worst of the dust, and crawled under the bed again. There was a lot of muffled cursing and the occasional clink of china and finally Albert emerged holding a staff taller than he was. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-27.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) \\n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \\n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
