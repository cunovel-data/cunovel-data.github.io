The position is everything Mort thought he\u0027d ever wanted, until he discovers that this perfect job can be a killer on his love life.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/mort-discworld-4.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":35,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
