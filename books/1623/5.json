The girl Ysabell was lean-big on the half-door, her chin in her hands.\n \u0027Are you a servant?\u0027 she said.\n Mort straightened up.\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said, \u0027I\u0027m an apprentice.\u0027\n That\u0027s silly. Albert said you can\u0027t be an apprentice.\u0027\n Mort concentrated on hefting a shovelful into the wheelbarrow. Two more shovelfuls, call it three if it\u0027s well pressed down, and that means four more barrows, all right, call it five, before I\u0027ve done halfway to the . . .\n \u0027He says,\u0027 said Ysabell in a louder voice, \u0027that apprentices become masters, and you can\u0027t have more than one Death. So you\u0027re just a servant and you have to do what I say.\u0027\n . . . and then eight more barrows means it\u0027s all done all the way to the door, which is nearly two-thirds of the whole thing, which means. . . .\n \u0027Did you hear what I said, boy?\u0027\n Mort nodded. And then it\u0027ll be fourteen more barrows, only call it fifteen because I haven\u0027t swept up properly in the corner, and. . . .\n \u0027Have you lost your tongue?\u0027\n \u0027Mort,\u0027 said Mort mildly.\n She looked at him furiously. \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027My name is Mort,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Or Mortimer. Most people call me Mort. Did you want to talk to me about something?\u0027\n She was speechless for a moment, staring from his face to the shovel and back again.\n \u0027Only I\u0027ve been told to get on with this,\u0027 said Mort.\n She exploded.\n \u0027Why are you here? Why did Father bring you here?\u0027\n \u0027He hired me at the hiring fair,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027All the boys got hired. And me.\u0027\n \u0027And you wanted to be hired?\u0027 she snapped. \u0027He\u0027s Death, you know. The Grim Reaper. He\u0027s very important. He\u0027s not something you become, he\u0027s something you are.\u0027\n Mort gestured vaguely at the wheelbarrow.\n \u0027I expect it\u0027ll turn out for the best,\u0027 he said. \u0027My father always says things generally do.\u0027\n He picked up the shovel and turned away, and grinned at the horse\u0027s backside as he heard Ysabell snort and walk away.\n Mort worked steadily through the sixteenths, eighths, quarters and thirds, wheeling the barrow out through the yard to the heap by the apple tree.\n Death\u0027s garden was big, neat and well-tended. It was also very, very black. The grass was black. The flowers were black. Black apples gleamed among the black leaves of a black apple tree. Even the air looked inky.\n Alter a while Mort thought he could see – no, he couldn\u0027t possibly imagine he could see . . . different colours of black.\n That\u0027s to say, not simply very dark tones of red and green and whatever, but real shades of black. A whole spectrum of colours, all different and all – well, black. He tipped out the last load, put the barrow away, and went back to the house.\n ENTER.\n Death was standing behind a lectern, poring over a map. He looked at Mort as if he wasn\u0027t entirely there.\n YOU HAVEN\u0027T HEARD OF THE BAY OF MANTE, HAVE YOU? he said.\n \u0027No, sir,\u0027 said Mort. FAMOUS SHIPWRECK THERE.\n \u0027Was there?\u0027\n THERE WILL BE, said Death, IF I CAN FIND THE DAMN PLACE.\n Mort walked around the lectern and peered at the map.\n \u0027You\u0027re going to sink the ship?\u0027 he said.\n Death looked horrified.\n CERTAINLY NOT. THERE WILL BE A COMBINATION OF BAD SEAMANSHIP, SHALLOW WATER AND A CONTRARY WIND.\n \u0027That\u0027s horrible,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Will there be many drowned?\u0027\n THAT\u0027S UP TO FATE, said Death, turning to the bookcase behind him and pulling out a heavy gazetteer. THERE\u0027S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. WHAT Is THAT SMELL?\n \u0027Me,\u0027 said Mort, simply.\n AH. THE STABLES. Death paused, his hand on the spine of the book. AND WHY DO YOU THINK I DIRECTED YOU TO THE STABLES? THINK CAREFULLY, NOW.\n Mort hesitated. He had been thinking carefully, in between counting wheelbarrows. He\u0027d wondered if it had been to coordinate his hand and eye, or teach him the habit of obedience, or bring home to him the importance, on the human scale, of small tasks, or make him realise that even great men must start at the bottom. None of these explanations seemed exactly right.\n \u0027I think . . .\u0027 he began.\n YES?\n \u0027Well, I think it was because you were up to your knees in horseshit, to tell you the truth.\u0027\n Death looked at him for a long time. Mort shifted uneasily from one foot to the other.\n ABSOLUTELY CORRECT, snapped Death. CLARITY OF THOUGHT. REALISTIC APPROACH. VERY IMPORTANT IN A JOB LIKE OURS.\n \u0027Yes, sir. Sir?\u0027\n HMM? Death was struggling with the index.\n \u0027People die all the time, sir, don\u0027t they? Millions. You must be very busy. But —\u0027\n Death gave Mort the look he was coming to be familiar with. It started off as blank surprise, flickered briefly towards annoyance, called in for a drink at recognition and settled finally on vague forbearance.\n BUT?\n \u0027I\u0027d have thought you\u0027d have been, well, out and about a bit more. You know. Stalking the streets. My granny\u0027s almanack\u0027s got a picture of you with a scythe and stuff.\u0027\n I SEE. I AM AFRAID IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN UNLESS YOU KNOW ABOUT POINT INCARNATION AND NODE FOCUSING. I DON\u0027T EXPECT YOU DO?\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so.\u0027\n GENERALLY I\u0027M ONLY EXPECTED TO MAKE AN ACTUAL APPEARANCE ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS.\n \u0027Like a king, I suppose,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I mean, a king is reigning even when he\u0027s doing something else or asleep, even. Is that it, sir?\u0027\n IT\u0027LL DO, said Death, rolling up the maps. AND NOW, BOY, IF YOU\u0027VE FINISHED THE STABLE YOU CAN GO AND SEE IF ALBERT HAS ANY JOBS HE WANTS DOING. IF YOU LIKE, YOU CAN COME OUT ON THE ROUND WITH ME THIS EVENING.\n Mort nodded. Death went back to his big leather book, took up a pen, stared at it for a moment, and then looked up at Mort with his skull on one side.\n HAVE YOU MET MY DAUGHTER? he said.\n \u0027Er. Yes, sir,\u0027 said Mort, his hand on the doorknob.\n SHE IS A VERY PLEASANT GIRL, said Death, BUT I THINK SHE QUITE LIKES HAVING SOMEONE OF HER OWN AGE AROUND TO TALK TO.\n \u0027Sir?\u0027\n AND, OF COURSE, ONE DAY ALL THIS WILL BELONG TO HER.\n Something like a small blue supernova flared for a moment in the depths of his eyesockets. It dawned on Mort that, with some embarrassment and complete lack of expertise, Death was trying to wink.\n In a landscape that owed nothing to time and space, which appeared on no map, which existed only in those far reaches of the multiplexed cosmos known to the few astrophysicists who have taken really bad acid, Mort spent the afternoon helping Albert plant out broccoli. It was black, tinted with purple.\n \u0027He tries, see,\u0027 said Albert, flourishing the dibber. \u0027It\u0027s just that when it comes to colour, he hasn\u0027t got much imagination.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure I understand all this,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Did you say he made all this?\u0027\n Beyond the garden wall the ground dropped towards a deep valley and then rose into dark moorland that marched all the way to distant mountains, jagged as cats\u0027 teeth.\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Albert. \u0027Mind what you\u0027re doing with that watering can.\u0027\n \u0027What was here before?\u0027\n \u0027I dunno,\u0027 said Albert, starting a fresh row. \u0027Firmament, I suppose. That\u0027s the fancy name for raw nothing. It\u0027s not a very good job of work, to tell the truth. I mean, the garden\u0027s okay, but the mountains are downright shoddy. They\u0027re all fuzzy when you get up close. I went and had a look once.\u0027\n Mort squinted hard at the trees nearest him. They seemed commendably solid.\n \u0027What\u0027d he do it all for?\u0027 he said.\n Albert grunted. \u0027Do you know what happens to lads who ask too many questions?\u0027\n Mort thought for a moment.\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said eventually, \u0027what?\u0027\n There was silence.\n Then Albert straightened up and said, \u0027Damned if I know. Probably they get answers, and serve \u0027em right.\u0027\n \u0027He said I could go out with him tonight,\u0027 said Mort.\n \u0027You\u0027re a lucky boy then, aren\u0027t you,\u0027 said Albert vaguely, heading back for the cottage.\n \u0027Did he really make all this?\u0027 said Mort, tagging along after him.\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027I suppose he wanted somewhere where he could feel at home.\u0027\n \u0027Are you dead, Albert?\u0027\n \u0027Me? Do I look dead?\u0027 The old man snorted when Mort started to give him a slow, critical look, \u0027and you can stop that. I\u0027m as alive as you are. Probably more.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027\n \u0027Right.\u0027 Albert pushed open the back door, and turned to regard Mort as kindly as he could manage.\n \u0027It\u0027s best not to ask all these questions,\u0027 he said, \u0027it upsets people. Now, how about a nice fry-up?\u0027\n The bell rang while they were playing dominoes. Mort sat to attention.\n \u0027He\u0027ll want the horse made ready,\u0027 said Albert. \u0027Come on.\u0027\n They went out to the stable in the gathering dusk, and Mort watched the old man saddle up Death\u0027s horse.\n \u0027His name\u0027s Binky,\u0027 said Albert, fastening the girth. \u0027It just goes to show, you never can tell.\u0027\n Bulky tried to eat his scarf in an affectionate way.\n Mort remembered the woodcut in his grandmother\u0027s almanack, between the page on planting times and the phases of the moon section, showing Dethe thee Great Levyller Comes To Alle Menne. He\u0027d stared at it hundreds of times when learning his letters. It wouldn\u0027t have been half so impressive if it had been generally known that the flame-breathing horse the spectre rode was called Binky.\n \u0027I would have thought something like Fang or Sabre or Ebony,\u0027 Albert continued, \u0027but the master will have his little fancies, you know. Looking forward to it, are you?\u0027\n \u0027I think so,\u0027 said Mort uncertainly. \u0027I\u0027ve never seen Death actually at work.\u0027\n \u0027Not many have,\u0027 said Albert. \u0027Not twice, at any rate.\u0027\n Mort took a deep breath.\n \u0027About this daughter of his —\u0027 he began.\n AH. GOOD EVENING, ALBERT, BOY.\n \u0027Mort,\u0027 said Mort automatically.\n Death strode into the stable, stooping a little to clear the ceiling. Albert nodded, not in any subservient way, Mort noticed, but simply out of form. Mort had met one or two servants, on the rare occasions he\u0027d been taken into town, and Albert wasn\u0027t like any of them. He seemed to act as though the house really belonged to him and its owner was just a passing guest, something to be tolerated like peeling paintwork or spiders in the lavatory. Death put up with it too, as though he and Albert had said everything that needed to be said a long time ago and were simply content, now, to get on with their jobs with the minimum of inconvenience all round. To Mort it was rather like going for a walk after a really bad thunderstorm – everything was quite fresh, nothing was particularly unpleasant, but there was the sense of vast energies just expended.\n Finding out about Albert tagged itself on to the end of his list of things to do.\n HOLD THIS, said Death, and pushed a scythe into his hand while he swung himself up on to Binky. The scythe looked normal enough, except for the blade: it was so thin that Mort could see through it, a pale blue shimmer in the air that could slice flame and chop sound. He held it very carefully.\n RIGHT, BOY, said Death. COME ON UP. ALBERT. DON\u0027T WAIT UP.\n The horse trotted out of the courtyard and into the sky.\n There should have been a flash or rush of stars. The air should have spiralled and turned into speeding sparks such as normally happens in the common, everyday trans-dimensional hyper-jumps. But this was Death, who has mastered the art of going everywhere without ostentation and could slide between dimensions as easily as he could slip through a locked door, and they moved at an easy gallop through cloud canyons, past great billowing mountains of cumulus, until the wisps parted in front of them and the Disc lay below, basking in sunlight.\n THAT\u0027S BECAUSE TIME IS ADJUSTABLE, said Death, hen Mort pointed this out. IT\u0027S NOT REALLY IMPORTANT.\n \u0027I always thought it was.\u0027\n PEOPLE THINK IT\u0027S IMPORTANT ONLY BECAUSE THEY INVENTED IT, said Death sombrely. Mort considered this rather trite, but decided not to argue. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-5.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Mort (Discworld #4) \n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
