They feemed in a bit of a hurry, if you ask me.\u0027\n Mort was already up on Binky\u0027s back.\n \u0027I fay!\u0027 shouted the knocker at his retreating back. \u0027I fay! Could you unftick me, boy?\u0027\n Mort tugged on Binky\u0027s reins so hard that the horse reared and danced crazily backwards across the cobbles, then reached out and grabbed the ring of the knocker. The gargoyle looked up into his face and suddenly felt like a very frightened doorknocker indeed. Mort\u0027s eyes glowed like crucibles, his expression was a furnace, his voice held enough heat to melt iron. It didn\u0027t know what he could do, but felt that it would prefer not to find out.\n \u0027What did you call me?\u0027 Mort hissed.\n The doorknocker thought quickly. \u0027Fir?\u0027 it said.\n \u0027What did you ask me to do?\u0027\n \u0027Unftick me?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t intend to.\u0027\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 said the doorknocker, \u0027fine. That\u0027s okay by me. I\u0027ll just ftick around, then.\u0027\n It watched Mort canter off along the street and shuddered with relief, knocking itself gently in its nervousness.\n \u0027A naaaarrow sqeeeak,\u0027 said one of the hinges.\n \u0027Fut up!\u0027\n Mort passed night watchmen, whose job now appeared to consist of ringing bells and shouting the name of the Princess, but a little uncertainly, as if they had difficulty remembering it. He ignored them, because he was listening to voices inside his head which went:\n She\u0027s only met you once, you fool. Why should she bother about you?\n Yes, but I did save her life.\n That means it belongs to her. Not to you. Besides, he\u0027s a wizard.\n So what? Wizards aren\u0027t supposed to – to go out with girls, they\u0027re celebrate. . . .\n Celebrate?\n They\u0027re not supposed to youknow. . . .\n What, never any youknow at all? said the internal voice, and it sounded as if it was grinning.\n It\u0027s supposed to be bad for the magic, thought Mort bitterly.\n Funny place to keep magic.\n Mort was shocked. Who are you? he demanded.\n I\u0027m you, Mort. Your inner self.\n Well, I wish I\u0027d get out of my head, it\u0027s quite crowded enough with me in here.\n Fair enough, said the voice, I was only trying to help. But remember, if you ever need you, you\u0027re always around.\n The voice faded away.\n Well, thought Mort bitterly, that must have been me. I\u0027m the only one that calls me Mort.\n The shock of the realisation quite obscured the fact that, while Mort had been locked into the monologue, he had ridden right through the gates of the palace. Of course, people rode through the gates of the palace every day, but most of them needed the things to be opened first.\n The guards on the other side were rigid with fear, because they thought they had seen a ghost. They would have been far more frightened if they had known that a ghost was almost exactly what they hadn\u0027t seen.\n The guard outside the doors of the great hall had seen it happen too, but he had time to gather his wits, or such that remained, and raise his spear as Binky trotted across the courtyard.\n \u0027Halt,\u0027 he croaked. \u0027Halt. What goes where?\u0027\n Mort saw him for the first time.\n \u0027What?\u0027 he said, still lost in thought.\n The guard ran his tongue over his dry lips, and backed away. Mort slid off Binky\u0027s back and walked forward.\n \u0027I meant, what goes there?\u0027 the guard tried again, with a mixture of doggedness and suicidal stupidity that marked him for early promotion.\n Mort caught the spear gently and lifted it out of the way of the door. As he did so the torchlight illuminated his face.\n \u0027Mort,\u0027 he said softly.\n It should have been enough for any normal soldier, but this guard was officer material.\n \u0027I mean, friend or foe?\u0027 he stuttered, trying to avoid Mort\u0027s gaze.\n \u0027Which would you prefer?\u0027 he grinned. It wasn\u0027t quite the grin of his master, but it was a pretty effective grin and didn\u0027t have a trace of humour in it.\n The guard sagged with relief, and stood aside.\n \u0027Pass, friend,\u0027 he said.\n Mort strode across the hall towards the staircase that led to the royal apartments. The hall had changed a lot since he last saw it. Portraits of Keli were everywhere; they\u0027d even replaced the ancient and crumbling battle banners in the shadowy heights of the roof. Anyone walking through the palace would have found it impossible to go more than a few steps without seeing a portrait. Part of Mort\u0027s mind wondered why, just as another part worried about the flickering dome that was steadily closing on the city, but most of his mind was a hot and steamy glow of rage and bewilderment and jealousy. Ysabell had been right, he thought, this must be love.\n \u0027The walk-through-walls boy!\u0027\n He jerked his head up. Cutwell was standing at the top of the stairs.\n The wizard had changed a lot too, Mort thought bitterly. Perhaps not that much, though. Although he was wearing a black and white robe embroidered with sequins, although his pointy hat was a yard high and decorated with more mystic symbols than a dental chart, and although his red velvet shoes had silver buckles and toes that curled like snails, there were still a few stains on his collar and he appeared to be chewing.\n He watched Mort climb the stairs towards him.\n \u0027Are you angry about something?\u0027 he said. \u0027I started work, but I got rather tied up with other things. Very difficult, walking through – why are you looking at me like that?\u0027\n \u0027What are you doing here?\u0027\n \u0027I might ask you the same question. Would you like a strawberry?\u0027\n Mort glanced at the small wooden punnet in the wizard\u0027s hands.\n \u0027In mid-winter?\u0027\n \u0027Actually, they\u0027re sprouts with a dash of enchantment.\u0027\n They taste like strawberries?\u0027\n Cutwell sighed. \u0027No, like sprouts. The spell isn\u0027t totally efficient. I thought they might cheer the princess up, but she threw them at me. Shame to waste them. Be my guest.\u0027\n Mort gaped at him.\n \u0027She threw them at you?\u0027\n \u0027Very accurately, I\u0027m afraid. Very strong-minded young lady.\u0027\n Hi, said a voice in the back of Mort\u0027s mind, it\u0027s you again, pointing out to yourself that the chances of the princess even contemplating you know with this fellow are on the far side of remote.\n Go away, thought Mort. His subconscious was worrying him. It appeared to have a direct line to parts of his body that he wanted to ignore at the moment.\n \u0027Why are you here?\u0027 he said aloud. \u0027Is it something to do with all these pictures?\u0027\n \u0027Good idea, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 beamed Cutwell. \u0027I\u0027m rather proud of it myself.\u0027\n \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Mort weakly. \u0027I\u0027ve had a busy day. I think I\u0027d like to sit down somewhere.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s the Throne Room,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027There\u0027s no-one in there at this time of night. Everyone\u0027s asleep.\u0027\n Mort nodded, and then looked suspiciously at the young wizard.\n \u0027What are you doing up, then?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Um,\u0027 said Cutwell, \u0027um, I just thought I\u0027d see if there was anything in the pantry.\u0027\n He shrugged.[6]\n Now is the time to report that Cutwell too notices that Mort, even a Mort weary with riding and lack of sleep, is somehow glowing from within and in some strange way unconnected with size is nevertheless larger than life. The difference is that Cutwell is, by training, a better guesser than other people and knows that in occult matters the obvious answer is usually the wrong one.\n Mort can move absentmindedly through walls and drink neat widowmaker soberly not because he is turning into a ghost, but because he is becoming dangerously real.\n In fact, as the boy stumbles while they walk along the silent corridors and steps through a marble pillar without noticing, it\u0027s obvious that the world is becoming a pretty insubstantial place from his point of view.\n \u0027You just walked through a marble pillar,\u0027 observed Cutwell. \u0027How did you do it?\u0027\n \u0027Did I?\u0027 Mort looked around. The pillar looked sound enough. He poked an arm towards it, and slightly bruised his elbow.\n \u0027I could have sworn you did,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027Wizards notice these things, you know.\u0027 He reached into the pocket of his robe.\n Then have you noticed the mist dome around the country?\u0027 said Mort.\n Cutwell squeaked. The jar in his hand dropped and smashed on the tiles; there was the smell of slightly rancid salad dressing.\n \u0027Already?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know about already,\u0027 said Mort, \u0027but there\u0027s this sort of crackling wall sliding over the land and no-one else seems to worry about it and—\u0027\n \u0027How fast was it moving?\u0027\n \u0027— it changes things!\u0027\n \u0027You saw it? How far away is it? How fast is it moving?\u0027\n \u0027Of course I saw it. I rode through it twice. It was like —\u0027\n \u0027But you\u0027re not a wizard, so why —\u0027\n \u0027What are you doing here, anyway —\u0027\n Cutwell took a deep breath. \u0027Everyone shut up!\u0027 he screamed.\n There was silence. Then the wizard grabbed Mort\u0027s arm. \u0027Come on,\u0027 he said, pulling him back along the corridor. \u0027I don\u0027t know who you are exactly and I hope I\u0027ve got time to find out one day but something really horrible is going to happen soon and I think you\u0027re involved, somehow.\u0027\n \u0027Something horrible? When?\u0027\n That depends on how far away the interface is and how fast it\u0027s moving,\u0027 said Cutwell, dragging Mort down a side passage. When they were outside a small oak door he let go of his arm and fumbled in his pocket again, removing a small hard piece of cheese and an unpleasantly squashy tomato.\n \u0027Hold these, will you? Thank you.\u0027 He delved again, produced a key and unlocked the door.\n \u0027It\u0027s going to kill the princess, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Mort.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Cutwell, \u0027and then again, no.\u0027 He paused with his hand on the doorhandle. \u0027That was pretty perspicacious of you. How did you know?\u0027\n \u0027I —\u0027 Mort hesitated.\n \u0027She told me a very strange story,\u0027 said Cutwell.\n \u0027I expect she did,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027If it was unbelievable, it was true.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re him, are you? Death\u0027s assistant?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. Off duty at the moment, though.\u0027\n \u0027Pleased to hear it.\u0027\n Cutwell shut the door behind them and fumbled for a candlestick. There was a pop, a flash of blue light and a whimper.\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 he said, sucking his fingers. \u0027Fire spell. Never really got the hang of it.\u0027\n \u0027You were expecting the dome thing, weren\u0027t you?\u0027 said Mort urgently. \u0027What will happen when it closes in?\u0027\n The wizard sat down heavily on the remains of a bacon sandwich.\n \u0027I\u0027m not exactly sure,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027ll be interesting to watch. But not from inside, I\u0027m afraid. What I think will happen is that the last week will never have existed.\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027ll suddenly die?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t quite understand. She will have been dead for a week. All this —\u0027 he waved his hands vaguely in the air – \u0027will not have happened. The assassin will have done his job. You will have done yours. History will have healed itself. Everything will be all right. From History\u0027s point of view, that is. There really isn\u0027t any other.\u0027\n Mort stared out of the narrow window. He could see across the courtyard into the glowing streets outside, where a picture of the princess smiled at the sky.\n \u0027Tell me about the pictures,\u0027 he said. That looks like some sort of wizard thing.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s working. You see, people were beginning to get upset and they didn\u0027t know why, and that made it worse. Their minds were in one reality and their bodies were in another. Very unpleasant. They couldn\u0027t get used to the idea that she was still alive. I thought the pictures might be a good idea but, you know, people just don\u0027t see what their mind tells them isn\u0027t there.\u0027\n \u0027I could have told you that,\u0027 said Mort bitterly.\n \u0027I had the town criers out during the daytime,\u0027 Cutwell continued. \u0027I thought that if people could come to believe in her, then this new reality could become the real one.\u0027\n \u0027Mmmph?\u0027 said Mort. He turned away from the window. \u0027What do you mean?\u0027\n \u0027Well, you see – I reckoned that if enough people believed in her, they could change reality. It works for gods. If people stop believing in a god, he dies. If a lot of them believe in him, he grows stronger.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-19.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Mort (Discworld #4) \n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
