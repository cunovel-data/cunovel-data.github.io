But my legs, I suggest, could at least stop a pig in a passageway.\u0027 \u0027Sorry —?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re not bandy,\u0027 she explained. \u0027Ah.\u0027 They strolled through the lily beds, temporarily lost for words. Eventually Ysabell confronted Mort and stuck out her hand. He shook it in thankful silence. \u0027Enough?\u0027 she said. \u0027Just about.\u0027 \u0027Good. Obviously we shouldn\u0027t get married, if only for the sake of the children.\u0027 Mort nodded. They sat down on a stone seat between some neatly clipped box hedges. Death had made a pond in this corner of the garden, fed by an icy spring that appeared to be vomited into the pool by a stone lion. Fat white carp lurked in the depths, or nosed on the surface among the velvety black water lilies. \u0027We should have brought some breadcrumbs,\u0027 said Mort gallantly, opting for a totally non-controversial subject. \u0027He never comes out here, you know,\u0027 said Ysabell, watching the fish. \u0027He made it to keep me amused.\u0027 \u0027It didn\u0027t work?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not real,\u0027 she said. \u0027Nothing\u0027s real here. Not really real. He just likes to act like a human being. He\u0027s trying really hard at the moment, have you noticed. I think you\u0027re having an effect on him. Did you know he tried to learn the banjo once?\u0027 \u0027I see him as more the organ type.\u0027 \u0027He couldn\u0027t get the hang of it,\u0027 said Ysabell, ignoring him. \u0027He can\u0027t create, you see.\u0027 \u0027You said he created this pool.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a copy of one he saw somewhere. Everything\u0027s a copy.\u0027 Mort shifted uneasily. Some small insect had crawled up his leg. \u0027It\u0027s rather sad,\u0027 he said, hoping that this was approximately the right tone to adopt. \u0027Yes.\u0027 She scooped a handful of gravel from the path and began to flick it absent-mindedly into the pool. \u0027Are my eyebrows that bad?\u0027 she said. \u0027Um,\u0027 said Mort, \u0027afraid so.\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 Flick, flick. The carp were watching her disdainfully. \u0027And my legs?\u0027 he said. \u0027Yes. Sorry.\u0027 Mort shuffled anxiously through his limited repertoire of small talk, and gave up. \u0027Never mind,\u0027 he said gallantly. \u0027At least you can use tweezers.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s very kind,\u0027 said Ysabell, ignoring him, \u0027in a sort of absent-minded way.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s not exactly your real father, is he?\u0027 \u0027My parents were killed crossing the Great Nef years ago. There was a storm, I think. He found me and brought me here. I don\u0027t know why he did it.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps he felt sorry for you?\u0027 \u0027He never feels anything. I don\u0027t mean that nastily, you understand. It\u0027s just that he\u0027s got nothing to feel with, no whatd\u0027youcallits, no glands. He probably thought sorry for me.\u0027 She turned her pale round face towards Mort. \u0027I won\u0027t hear a word against him. He tries to do his best. It\u0027s just that he\u0027s always got so much to think about.\u0027 \u0027My father was a bit like that. Is, I mean.\u0027 \u0027I expect he\u0027s got glands, though.\u0027 \u0027I imagine he has,\u0027 said Mort, shifting uneasily. \u0027Its not something I\u0027ve ever really thought about, glands.\u0027 They stared side by side at the trout. The trout stared back. \u0027I\u0027ve just upset the entire history of the future,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027You see, when he tried to kill her I killed him, but the thing is, according to the history she should have died and the duke would be king, but the worst bit, the worst bit is that although he\u0027s absolutely rotten to the core he\u0027d unite the cities and eventually they\u0027ll be a federation and the books say there\u0027ll be a hundred years of peace and plenty. I mean, you\u0027d think there\u0027d be a reign of terror or something, but apparently history needs this kind of person sometimes and the princess would just be another monarch. I mean, not bad, quite good really, but just not right and now it\u0027s not going to happen and history is flapping around loose and it\u0027s all my fault.\u0027 He subsided, anxiously awaiting her reply. \u0027You were right, you know.\u0027 \u0027I was?\u0027 \u0027We ought to have brought some breadcrumbs,\u0027 she said. \u0027I suppose they find things to eat in the water. Beetles and so on.\u0027 \u0027Did you hear what I said?\u0027 \u0027What about?\u0027 \u0027Oh. Nothing. Nothing much, really. Sorry.\u0027 Ysabell sighed and stood up. \u0027I expect you\u0027ll be wanting to get off,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m glad we got this marriage business sorted out. It was quite nice talking to you.\u0027 \u0027We could have a sort of hate-hate relationship,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I don\u0027t normally get to talk with the people father works with.\u0027 She appeared to be unable to draw herself away, as though she was waiting for Mort to say something else. \u0027Well, you wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 was all he could think of. \u0027I expect you\u0027ve got to go off to work now.\u0027 \u0027More or less.\u0027 Mort hesitated, aware that in some indefinable way the conversation had drifted out of the shallows and was now floating over some deep bits he didn\u0027t quite understand. There was a noise like — It made Mort recall the old yard at home, with a pang of homesickness. During the harsh Ramtop winters the family kept hardy mountain tharga beasts in the yard, chucking in straw as necessary. After the spring thaw the yard was several feet deep and had quite a solid crust on it. You could walk across it if you were careful. If you weren\u0027t, and sank knee deep in the concentrated gyppo, then the sound your boot made as it came out, green and steaming, was as much the sound of the turning year as birdsong and beebuzz. It was that noise. Mort instinctively examined his shoes. Ysabell was crying, not in little ladylike sobs, but in great yawning gulps, like bubbles from an underwater volcano, fighting one another to be the first to the surface. They were sobs escaping under pressure, matured in humdrum misery. Mort said,\u0027Er?\u0027 Her body was shaking like a waterbed in an earthquake zone. She fumbled urgently in her sleeves for the handkerchief, but it was no more use in the circumstances than a paper hat in a thunderstorm. She tried to say something, which became a stream of consonants punctuated by sobs. Mort said, \u0027Um?\u0027 \u0027I said, how old do you think I am?\u0027 \u0027Fifteen?\u0027 he hazarded. \u0027I\u0027m sixteen,\u0027 she wailed. \u0027And do you know how long I\u0027ve been sixteen for?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t under —\u0027 \u0027No, you wouldn\u0027t. No-one would.\u0027 She blew her nose again, and despite her shaking hands nevertheless carefully tucked the rather damp hanky back up her sleeve. \u0027You\u0027re allowed out,\u0027 she said. \u0027You haven\u0027t been here long enough to notice. Time stands still here, haven\u0027t you noticed? Oh, something passes, but it\u0027s not real time. He can\u0027t create real time.\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 When she spoke again it was in the thin, careful and above all brave voice of someone who has pulled themselves together despite overwhelming odds but might let go again at any moment. \u0027I\u0027ve been sixteen for thirty-five years.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 \u0027It was bad enough the first year.\u0027 Mort looked back at his last few weeks, and nodded in sympathy. \u0027Is that why you\u0027ve been reading all those books?\u0027 he said. Ysabell looked down, and twiddled a sandalled toe in the gravel in an embarrassed fashion. \u0027They\u0027re very romantic,\u0027 she said. \u0027There\u0027s some really lovely stories. There was this girl who drank poison when her young man had died, and there was one who jumped off a cliff because her father insisted she should marry this old man, and another one drowned herself rather than submit to—\u0027 Mort listened in astonishment. To judge by Ysabell\u0027s careful choice of reading matter, it was a matter of note for any Disc female to survive adolescence long enough to wear out a pair of stockings. \u0027— and then she thought he was dead, and she killed herself and then he woke up and so he did kill himself, and then there was this girl —\u0027 Common sense suggested that at least a few women reached their third decade without killing themselves for love, but common sense didn\u0027t seem to get even a walk-on part in these dramas.[5] Mort was already aware that love made you feel hot and cold and cruel and weak, but he hadn\u0027t realised that it could make you stupid. \u0027 – swam the river every night, but one night there was this storm, and when he didn\u0027t arrive she —\u0027 Mort felt instinctively that some young couples met, say, at a village dance, and hit it off, and went out together for a year or two, had a few rows, made up, got married and didn\u0027t kill themselves at all. He became aware that the litany of star-crossed love had wound down. \u0027Oh,\u0027 he said, weakly. \u0027Doesn\u0027t anyone just, you know, just get along any more?\u0027 To love is to suffer,\u0027 said Ysabell. There\u0027s got to be lots of dark passion.\u0027 \u0027Has there?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely. And anguish.\u0027 Ysabell appeared to recall something. \u0027Did you say something about something flapping around loose?\u0027 she said, in the tight voice of someone pulling themselves together. Mort considered. \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m afraid I wasn\u0027t paying much attention.\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter at all.\u0027 They strolled back to the house in silence. When Mort went back to the study he found that Death had gone, leaving four hourglasses on the desk. The big leather book was lying on a lectern, securely locked shut. There was a note tucked under the glasses. Mort had imagined that Death\u0027s handwriting would either be gothic or else tombstone angular, but Death had in fact studied a classic work on graphology before selecting a style and had adopted a hand that indicated a balanced, well-adjusted personality. It said: Gone fyshing. Theyre ys ane execution in Pseudopoiis, a naturral in Krull, a faytal fall in the Carrick Mtns, ane ague in Ell-Kinte. Thee rest of thee day\u0027s your own. Mort thought that history was thrashing around like a steel hawser with the tension off, twanging backwards and forwards across reality in great destructive sweeps. History isn\u0027t like that. History unravels gently, like an old sweater. It has been patched and darned many times, reknitted to suit different people, shoved in a box under the sink of censorship to be cut up for the dusters of propaganda, yet it always – eventually – manages to spring back into its old familiar shape. History has a habit of changing the people who think they are changing it. History always has a few tricks up its frayed sleeve. It\u0027s been around a long time. This is what was happening: The misplaced stroke of Mort\u0027s scythe had cut history into two separate realities. In the city of Sto Lat Princess Keli still ruled, with a certain amount of difficulty and with the full time aid of the Royal Recogniser, who was put on the court payroll and charged with the duty of remembering that she existed. In the lands outside, though – beyond the plain, in the Ramtops, around the Circle Sea and all the way to the Rim – the traditional reality still held sway and she was quite definitely dead, the duke was king and the world was proceeding sedately according to plan, whatever that was. The point is that both realities were true. The sort of historical event horizon was currently about twenty miles away from the city, and wasn\u0027t yet very noticeable. That\u0027s because the – well, call it the difference in historical pressures – wasn\u0027t yet very great. But it was growing. Out in the damp cabbage fields there was a shimmer in the air and a faint sizzle, like frying grasshoppers. People don\u0027t alter history any more than birds alter the sky, they just make brief patterns in it. Inch by inch, implacable as a glacier and far colder, the real reality was grinding back towards Sto Lat. Mort was the first person to notice. It had been a long afternoon. The mountaineer had held on to his icy handhold until the last moment and the executee had called Mort a lackey of the monarchist state. Only the old lady of 103, who had gone to her reward surrounded by her sorrowing relatives, had smiled at him and said he was looking a little pale.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-16.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.
