{"id":95325,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u0027You\u0027re staying here, sir?\u0027 Death looked up and down the street. His eye-sockets flared.\n I THOUGHT I MIGHT STROLL AROUND A BIT, he said mysteriously. I DON\u0027T SEEM TO FEEL QUITE RIGHT. I COULD DO WITH THE FRESH AIR. He seemed to remember something, reached into the mysterious shadows of his cloak, and pulled out three hourglasses. ALL STRAIGHTFORWARD, he said. ENJOY YOURSELF.\n He turned and strode off down the street, humming.\n \u0027Um. Thank you,\u0027 said Mort. He held the hourglasses up to the light, noting the one that was on its very last few grains of sand.\n \u0027Does this mean I\u0027m in charge?\u0027 he called, but Death had turned the corner.\n Binky greeted him with a faint whinny of recognition. Mort mounted up, his heart pounding with apprehension and responsibility. His fingers worked automatically, taking the scythe out of its sheath and adjusting and locking the blade (which flashed steely blue in the night, slicing the starlight like salami). He mounted carefully, wincing at the stab from his saddlesores, but Binky was like riding a pillow. As an afterthought, drunk with delegated authority, he pulled Death\u0027s riding cloak out of its saddlebag and fastened it by its silver brooch.\n He took another look at the first hourglass, and nudged Binky with his knees. The horse sniffed the chilly air, and began to trot.\n Behind them Cutwell burst out of his doorway, accelerating down the frosty street with his robes flying out behind him.\n Now the horse was cantering, widening the distance between its hooves and the cobbles. With a swish of its tail it cleared the housetops and floated up into the chilly sky.\n Cutwell ignored it. He had more pressing things on his mind. He took a flying leap and landed full length in the freezing waters of the horsetrough, lying back gratefully among the bobbing ice splinters. After a while the water began to steam. Mort kept low for the sheer exhilaration of the speed. The sleeping countryside roared soundlessly underneath. Binky moved at an easy gallop, his great muscles sliding under his skin as easily as alligators off a sandbank, his mane whipping in Mort\u0027s face. The night swirled away from the speeding edge of the scythe, cut into two curling halves.\n They sped under the moonlight as silent as a shadow, visible only to cats and people who dabbled in things men were not meant to wot of.\n Mort couldn\u0027t remember afterwards, but very probably he laughed.\n Soon the frosty plains gave way to the broken lands around the mountains, and then the marching ranks of the Ramtops themselves raced across the world towards them. Binky put his head down and opened his stride, aiming for a pass between two mountains as sharp as goblins\u0027 teeth in the silver light. Somewhere a wolf howled.\n Mort took another look at the hourglass. Its frame was carved with oak leaves and mandrake roots, and the sand inside, even by moonlight, was pale gold. By turning the glass this way and that, he could just make out the name \u0027Ammeline Hamstring\u0027 etched in the faintest of lines.\n Binky slowed to a canter. Mort looked down at the roof of a forest, dusted with snow that was either early or very, very late; it could have been either, because the Ramtops hoarded their weather and doled it out with no real reference to the time of year.\n A gap opened up beneath them. Binky slowed again, wheeled around and descended towards a clearing that was white with drifted snow. It was circular, with a tiny cottage in the exact middle. If the ground around it hadn\u0027t been covered in snow, Mort would have noticed that there were no tree stumps to be seen; the trees hadn\u0027t been cut down in the circle, they\u0027d simply been discouraged from growing there. Or had moved away.\n Candlelight spilled from one downstairs window, making a pale orange pool on the snow.\n Binky touched down smoothly and trotted across the freezing crust without sinking. He left no hoofprints, of course.\n Mort dismounted and walked towards the door, muttering to himself and making experimental sweeps with the scythe.\n The cottage roof had been built with wide eaves, to shed snow and cover the logpile. No dweller in the high Ramtops would dream of starting a winter without a logpile on three sides of the house. But there wasn\u0027t a logpile here, even though spring was still a long way off.\n There was, however, a bundle of hay in a net by the door. It had a note attached, written in big, slightly shaky capitals: FOR THEE HORS.\n It would have worried Mort if he\u0027d let it. Someone was expecting him. He\u0027d learned in recent days, though, that rather than drown in uncertainty it was best to surf right over the top of it. Anyway, Binky wasn\u0027t worried by moral scruples and bit straight in.\n It did leave the problem of whether to knock. Somehow, it didn\u0027t seem appropriate. Supposing no-one answered, or told him to go away?\n So he lifted the thumb latch and pushed at the door. It swung inwards quite easily, without a creak.\n There was a low-ceilinged kitchen, its beams at trepanning height for Mort. The light from the solitary candle glinted off crockery on a long dresser and flagstones that had been scrubbed and polished into iridescence. The fire in the cave-like inglenook didn\u0027t add much light, because it was no more than a heap of white ash under the remains of a log. Mort knew, without being told, that it was the last log.\n An elderly lady was sitting at the kitchen table, writing furiously with her hooked nose only a few inches from the paper. A grey cat curled on the table beside her blinked calmly at Mort.\n The scythe bumped off a beam. The woman looked up.\n \u0027Be with you in a minute,\u0027 she said. She frowned at the paper. \u0027I haven\u0027t put in the bit about being of sound mind and body yet, lot of foolishness anyway, no-one sound in mind and body would be dead. Would you like a drink?\u0027\n \u0027Pardon?\u0027 said Mort. He recalled himself, and repeated \u0027PARDON?\u0027\n \u0027If you drink, that is. It\u0027s raspberry port. On the dresser. You might as well finish the bottle.\u0027\n Mort eyed the dresser suspiciously. He felt he\u0027d rather lost the initiative. He pulled out the hourglass and glared at it. There was a little heap of sand left.\n There\u0027s still a few minutes yet,\u0027 said the witch, without looking up.\n \u0027How, I mean, HOW DO YOU KNOW?\u0027\n She ignored him, and dried the ink in front of the candle, sealed the letter with a drip of wax, and tucked it under the candlestick. Then she picked up the cat.\n \u0027Granny Beedle will be around directly tomorrow to tidy up and you\u0027re to go with her, understand? And see she lets Gammer Nutley have the pink marble washstand, she\u0027s had her eye on it for years.\u0027\n The cat yawped knowingly.\n \u0027I haven\u0027t, that is, I HAVEN\u0027T GOT ALL NIGHT, YOU KNOW,\u0027 said Mort reproachfully.\n \u0027You have, I haven\u0027t, and there\u0027s no need to shout,\u0027 said the witch. She slid off her stall and then Mort saw how bent she was, like a bow. With some difficulty she unhooked a tall pointed hat from its nail on the wall, skewered it into place on her white hair with a battery of hatpins, and grasped two walking sticks.\n She tottered across the floor towards Mort, and looked up at him with eyes as small and bright as blackcurrants.\n \u0027Will I need my shawl? Shall I need a shawl, d\u0027you think? No, I suppose not. I imagine it\u0027s quite warm where I\u0027m going.\u0027 She peered closely at Mort, and frowned.\n \u0027You\u0027re rather younger than I imagined,\u0027 she said. Mort said nothing. Then Goodie Hamstring said, quietly, \u0027You know, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re who I was expecting at all.\u0027\n Mort cleared his throat.\n \u0027Who were you expecting, precisely?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Death,\u0027 said the witch, simply. \u0027It\u0027s part of the arrangement, you see. One gets to know the time of one\u0027s death in advance, and one is guaranteed â€“ personal attention.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m it,\u0027said Mort.\n \u0027It?\u0027\n \u0027The personal attention. He sent me. I work for him. No-one else would have me.\u0027 Mort paused. This was all wrong. He\u0027d be sent home again in disgrace. His first bit of responsibility, and he\u0027d ruined it. He could already hear people laughing at him.\n The wail started in the depths of his embarrassment and blared out like a foghorn. \u0027Only this is my first real job and it\u0027s all gone wrong!\u0027\n The scythe fell to the floor with a clatter, slicing a piece off the table leg and cutting a flagstone in half.\n Goodie watched him for some time, with her head on one side. Then she said, \u0027I see. What is your name, young man?\u0027\n \u0027Mort,\u0027 sniffed Mort. \u0027Short for Mortimer.\u0027\n \u0027Well, Mort, I expect you\u0027ve got an hourglass somewhere about your person,\u0027\n Mort nodded vaguely. He reached down to his belt and produced the glass. The witch inspected it critically.\n \u0027Still a minute or so,\u0027 she said. \u0027We don\u0027t have much time to lose. Just give me a moment to lock p.\u0027\n \u0027But you don\u0027t understand!\u0027 Mort wailed. \u0027I\u0027ll mess it all up! I\u0027ve never done this before!\u0027\n She patted his hand. \u0027Neither have I,\u0027 she said. \u0027We can learn together. Now pick up the scythe and try to act your age, there\u0027s a good boy.\u0027\n Against his protestations she shooed him out into the snow and followed behind him, pulling the door shut and locking it with a heavy iron key which she hung on a nail by the door.\n The frost had tightened its grip on the forest, squeezing it until the roots creaked. The moon was setting, but the sky was full of hard white stars that made the winter seem colder still. Goodie Hamstring shivered.\n \u0027There\u0027s an old log over there,\u0027 she said conversationally. \u0027There\u0027s quite a good view across the valley. In the summertime, of course. I should like to sit down.\u0027\n Mort helped her through the drifts and brushed as much snow as possible off the wood. They sat down with the hourglass between them. Whatever the view might have been in the summer, it now consisted of black rocks against a sky from which little flakes of snow were now tumbling.\n \u0027I can\u0027t believe all this,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I mean you sound as if you want to die.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s some things I shall miss,\u0027 she said. \u0027But it gets thin, you know. Life, I\u0027m referring to. You can\u0027t trust your own body any more, and it\u0027s time to move on. I reckon it\u0027s about time I tried something else. Did he tell you magical folk can see him all the time?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Mort, inaccurately.\n \u0027Well, we can.\u0027\n \u0027He doesn\u0027t like wizards and witches much,\u0027 Mort volunteered.\n \u0027Nobody likes a smartass,\u0027 she said with some satisfaction. \u0027We give him trouble, you see. Priests don\u0027t, so he likes priests.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s never said,\u0027 said Mort.\n \u0027Ah. They\u0027re always telling folk how much better it\u0027s going to be when they\u0027re dead. We tell them it could be pretty good right here if only they\u0027d put their minds to it.\u0027\n Mort hesitated. He wanted to say: you\u0027re wrong, he\u0027s not like that at all, he doesn\u0027t care if people are good or bad so long as they\u0027re punctual. And kind to cats, he added.\n But he thought better of it. It occurred to him that people needed to believe things.\n The wolf howled again, so near that Mort looked around apprehensively. Another one across the valley answered it. The chorus was picked up by a couple of others in the depths of the forest. Mort had never heard anything so mournful.\n He glanced sideways at the still figure of Goodie Hamstring and then, with mounting panic, at the hourglass. He sprang to his feet, snatched up the scythe, and brought it around in a two-handed swing.\n The witch stood up, leaving her body behind.\n \u0027Well done,\u0027 she said. \u0027I thought you\u0027d missed it, for a minute, there.\u0027\n Mort leaned against a tree, panting heavily, and watched Goodie walk around the log to look at herself.\n \u0027Hmm,\u0027 she said critically. Time has got a lot to answer for.\u0027 She raised her hand and laughed to see the stars through it.\n Then she changed. Mort had seen this happen before, when the soul realised it was no longer bound by the body\u0027s morphic field, but never under such control. Her hair unwound itself from its tight bun, changing colour and lengthening. Her body straightened up. Wrinkles dwindled and vanished. Her grey woollen dress moved like the surface of the sea and ended up tracing entirely different and disturbing contours. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-10.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Mort (Discworld #4) \n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
