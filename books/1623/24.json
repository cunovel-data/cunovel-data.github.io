You could do with a good night\u0027s sleep, my lad.\u0027\n \u0027M\u0027t,\u0027 murmured Mort.\n He felt Ysabell slip his arm over her shoulder. The walls were moving gently, even the sound of his own voice was coming from a long way off, and he dimly felt how nice it would be to stretch out on a nice stone slab and sleep forever.\n Death\u0027d be back soon, he told himself, feeling his unprotesting body being helped along the corridors. There was nothing for it, he\u0027d have to tell Death. He wasn\u0027t such a bad old stick. Death would help; all he needed to do was explain things. And then he could stop all this worrying and go to slee. . . .\n \u0027And what was your previous position?\u0027\n I BEG YOUR PARDON?\n \u0027What did you do for a living?\u0027 said the thin young man behind the desk.\n The figure opposite him shifted uneasily.\n I USHERED SOULS INTO THE NEXT WORLD. I WAS THE GRAVE OF ALL HOPE. I WAS THE ULTIMATE REALITY. I WAS THE ASSASSIN AGAINST WHOM NO LOCK WOULD HOLD.\n \u0027Yes, point taken, but do you have any particular skills?\u0027\n Death thought about it.\n I SUPPOSE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EXPERTISE WITH AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS? he ventured after a while.\n The young man shook his head firmly.\n NO?\n \u0027This is a city, Mr —\u0027 he glanced down, and once again felt a faint unease that he couldn\u0027t quite put his finger on – \u0027Mr – Mr – Mr, and we\u0027re a bit short of fields.\u0027\n He laid down his pen and gave the kind of smile that suggested he\u0027d learned it from a book.\n Ankh-Morpork wasn\u0027t advanced enough to possess an employment exchange. People took jobs because their fathers made room for them, or because their natural talent found an opening, or by word-of-mouth. But there was a call for servants and menial workers, and with the commercial sections of the city beginning to boom the thin young man – a Mr Liona Keeble – had invented the profession of job broker and was, right at this moment, finding it difficult.\n \u0027My dear Mr —\u0027 he glanced down – \u0027Mr, we get many people coming into the city from outside because, alas, they believe life is richer here. Excuse me for saying so, but you seem to me to be a gentleman down on his luck. I would have thought you would have preferred something rather more refined than —\u0027 he glanced down again, and frowned – \u0027 “something nice working with cats or flowers”.\u0027\n I\u0027M SORRY. I FELT IT WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE.\n \u0027Can you play a musical instrument ?\u0027\n NO.\n \u0027Can you do carpentry?\u0027\n I DO NOT KNOW, I HAVE NEVER TRIED. Death tared at his feet. He was beginning to feel deeply embarrassed.\n Keeble shuffled the paper on his desk, and sighed.\n I CAN WALK THROUGH WALLS, Death volunteered, aware that the conversation had reached an impasse.\n Keeble looked up brightly. \u0027I\u0027d like to see that,\u0027 he said. \u0027That could be quite a qualification.\u0027\n RIGHT.\n Death pushed his chair back and stalked confidently towards the nearest wall.\n OUCH.\n Keeble watched expectantly. \u0027Go on, then,\u0027 he said.\n UM. THIS IS AN ORDINARY WALL, IS IT?\n \u0027I assume so. I\u0027m not an expert.\u0027\n IT SEEMS TO BE PRESENTING ME WITH SOME DIFFICULTY.\n \u0027So it would appear.\u0027\n WHAT DO YOU CALL THE FEELING OF BEING VERY SMALL AND HOT?\n Keeble twiddled his pencil.\n \u0027Pygmy?\u0027\n BEGINS WITH AN M.\n \u0027Embarrassing?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Death, I MEAN YES.\n \u0027It would seem that you have no useful skill or talent whatsoever,\u0027 he said. \u0027Have you thought of going into teaching?\u0027\n Death\u0027s face was a mask of terror. Well, it was always a mask of terror, but this time he meant it to be.\n \u0027You see,\u0027 said Keeble kindly, putting down his pen and steepling his hands together, \u0027it\u0027s very seldom I ever have to find a new career for an – what was it again?\u0027\n ANTHROPOMORPHIC PERSONIFICATION.\n \u0027Oh, yes. What is that, exactly?\u0027\n Death had had enough.\n THIS, he said.\n For a moment, just for a moment, Mr Keeble saw him clearly. His face went nearly as pale as Death\u0027s own. His hands jerked convulsively. His heart gave a stutter.\n Death watched him with mild interest, then drew an hourglass from the depths of his robe and held it up to the light and examined it critically.\n SETTLE DOWN, he said, YOU\u0027VE GOT A GOOD FEW YEARS YET.\n \u0027Bbbbbbb —\u0027\n I COULD TELL YOU HOW MANY IF YOU LIKE.\n Keeble, fighting to breathe, managed to shake his head.\n DO YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU A GLASS OF WATER, THEN?\n \u0027nnN – nnN.\u0027\n The shop bell jangled. Keeble\u0027s eyes rolled. Death decided that he owed the man something. He shouldn\u0027t be allowed to lose custom, which was clearly something humans valued dearly.\n He pushed aside the bead curtain and stalked into the outer shop, where a small fat woman, looking rather like an angry cottage loaf, was hammering on the counter with a haddock.\n \u0027It\u0027s about that cook\u0027s job up at the University,\u0027 she said. \u0027You told me it was a good position and it\u0027s a disgrace up there, the tricks them students play, and I demand – I want you to – I\u0027m not.\n Her voice trailed off.\n \u0027 \u0027Ere,\u0027 she said, but you could tell her heart wasn\u0027t in it, \u0027you\u0027re not Keeble, are you?\u0027\n Death stared at her. He\u0027d never before experienced an unsatisfied customer. He was at a loss. Finally he gave up.\n BEGONE, YOU BLACK AND MIDNIGHT HAG, he said.\n The cook\u0027s small eyes narrowed.\n \u0027 \u0027Oo are you calling a midnight bag?\u0027 she said accusingly, and hit the counter with the fish again. \u0027Look at this,\u0027 she said. \u0027Last night it was my bedwarmer, in the morning it\u0027s a fish. I ask you.\u0027\n MAY ALL THE DEMONS OF HELL REND YOUR LIVING SPIRIT IF YOU DON\u0027T GET OUT OF THE SHOP THIS MINUTE, Death tried.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know about that, but what about my bedwarmer? It\u0027s no place for a respectable woman up there, they tried to —\u0027\n IF YOU WOULD CARE TO GO AWAY, said Death desperately, I WILL GIVE YOU SOME MONEY.\n \u0027How much?\u0027 said the cook, with a speed that would have outdistanced a striking rattlesnake and given lightning a nasty shock.\n Death pulled out his coin bag and tipped a heap of verdigrised and darkened coins on the counter. She regarded them with deep suspicion.\n NOW LEAVE UPON THE INSTANT, said Death, and added, BEFORE THE SEARING WINDS OF INFINITY SCORCH THY WORTHLESS CARCASS.\n \u0027My husband will be told about this,\u0027 said the cook darkly, as she left the shop. It seemed to Death that no threat of his could possibly be as dire.\n He stalked back through the curtains. Keeble, still slumped in his chair, gave a kind of strangled gurgle.\n \u0027It was true!\u0027 he said. \u0027I thought you were a nightmare!\u0027\n I COULD TAKE OFFENCE AT THAT, said Death.\n \u0027You really are Death?\u0027 said Keeble.\n YES.\n \u0027Why didn\u0027t you say?\u0027\n PEOPLE USUALLY PREFER ME NOT TO.\n Keeble scrabbled among his papers, giggling hysterically.\n \u0027You want to do something else?\u0027 he said. Tooth fairy? Water sprite? Sandman?\u0027\n DO NOT BE FOOLISH. I SIMPLY – FEEL I WANT A CHANGE.\n Keeble\u0027s frantic rustling at last turned up the paper he\u0027d been searching for. He gave a maniacal laugh and thrust it into Death\u0027s hands.\n Death read it.\n THIS is A JOB? PEOPLE ARE PAID TO DO THIS?\n \u0027Yes, yes, go and see him, you\u0027re just the right type. Only don\u0027t tell him I sent you.\u0027\n Binky moved at a hard gallop across the night, the Disc unrolling far below his hooves. Now Mort found that the sword could reach out further than he had thought, it could reach the stars themselves, and he swung it across the deeps of space and into the heart of a yellow dwarf which went nova most satisfactorily. He stood in the saddle and whirled the blade around his head, laughing as the blue flame fanned across the sky leaving a trail of darkness and embers.\n And didn\u0027t stop. Mort struggled as the sword cut through the horizon, grinding down the mountains, drying up the seas, turning green forests into punk and ashes. He heard voices behind him, and the brief screams of friends and relatives as he turned desperately. Dust storms whirled from the dead earth as he fought to release his own grip, but the sword burned icy cold in his hand, dragging him on in a dance that would not end until there was nothing left alive.\n And that time came, and Mort stood alone except for Death, who said, \u0027A fine job, boy.\u0027\n And Mort said, MORT.\n \u0027Mort! Mort! Wake up!\u0027\n Mort surfaced slowly, like a corpse in a pond. He fought against it, clinging to his pillow and the horrors of sleep, but someone was tugging urgently at his ear.\n \u0027Mmmph?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Mort!\u0027\n \u0027Wsst?\u0027\n \u0027Mort, it\u0027s father!\u0027\n He opened his eyes and stared up blankly into Ysabell\u0027s face. Then the events of the previous night hit him like a sock full of damp sand.\n Mort swung his legs out of bed, still wreathed in the remains of his dream.\n \u0027Yeah, okay,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027\u0027 go and see him directly.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s not here! Albert\u0027s going crazy!\u0027 Ysabell stood by the bed, tugging a handkerchief between her hands. \u0027Mort, do you think something bad has happened to him?\u0027\n He gave her a blank look. \u0027Don\u0027t be bloody stupid,\u0027 he said, \u0027he\u0027s Death.\u0027 He scratched his skin. He felt hot and dry and itchy.\n \u0027But he\u0027s never been away this long! Not even when there was that big plague in Pseudopolis! I mean, he has to be here in the mornings to do the books and work out the nodes and —\u0027\n Mort grabbed her arms. \u0027All right, all right,\u0027 he said, as soothingly as he could manage. \u0027I\u0027m sure everything\u0027s okay. Just settle down, I\u0027ll go and check . . . why have you got your eyes shut?\u0027\n \u0027Mort, please put some clothes on,\u0027 said Ysabell in a tight little voice.\n Mort looked down.\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 he said meekly, \u0027I didn\u0027t realise . . . Who put me to bed?\u0027\n \u0027I did,\u0027 she said. \u0027But I looked the other way.\u0027\n Mort dragged on his breeches, shrugged into his shirt and hurried out towards Death\u0027s study with Ysabell on his heels. Albert was in there, jumping from foot to foot like a duck on a griddle. When Mort came in the look on the old man\u0027s face could almost have been gratitude.\n Mort saw with amazement that there were tears in his eyes.\n \u0027His chair hasn\u0027t been sat in,\u0027 Albert whined.\n \u0027Sorry, but is that important?\u0027 said Mort. \u0027My grandad didn\u0027t used to come home for days if he\u0027d had a good sale at the market.\u0027\n \u0027But he\u0027s always here,\u0027 said Albert. \u0027Every morning, as long as I\u0027ve known him, sitting here at his desk a-working on the nodes. It\u0027s his job. He wouldn\u0027t miss it.\u0027\n \u0027I expect the nodes can look after themselves for a day or two,\u0027 said Mort.\n The drop in temperature told him he was wrong. He looked at their faces.\n They can\u0027t?\u0027 he said.\n Both heads shook.\n \u0027If the nodes aren\u0027t worked out properly all the Balance is destroyed,\u0027 said Ysabell. \u0027Anything could happen.\u0027\n \u0027Didn\u0027t he explain?\u0027 said Albert.\n \u0027Not really. I\u0027ve really only done the practical side. He said he\u0027d tell me about the theoretical stuff later,\u0027 said Mort. Ysabell burst into tears.\n Albert took Mort\u0027s arm and, with considerable dramatic waggling of his eyebrows, indicated that they should have a little talk in the corner. Mort trailed after him reluctantly.\n The old man rummaged in his pockets and at last produced a battered paper bag.\n \u0027Peppermint?\u0027 he enquired.\n Mort shook his head.\n \u0027He never tell you about the nodes?\u0027 said Albert.\n Mort shook\u0027 his head again. Albert gave his peppermint a suck; it sounded like the plughole in the bath of God.\n \u0027How old are you, lad?\u0027\n \u0027Mort. I\u0027m sixteen.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s some things a lad ought to be tole before he\u0027s sixteen,\u0027 said Albert, looking over his shoulder at Ysabell, who was sobbing in Death\u0027s chair. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-24.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Mort (Discworld #4) \n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
