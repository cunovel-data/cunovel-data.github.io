This was power, this was living; he\u0027d challenge old boniface and spit in his empty eye. \u0027By the Smoking Mirror of Grism, there\u0027s going to be a few changes around here!\u0027 Those wizards who had studied history nodded uncomfortably. It would be back to the stone floors and getting up when it was still dark and no alcohol under any circumstances and memorising the true names of everything until the brain squeaked. \u0027What\u0027s that man doing!\u0027 A wizard who had absent-mindedly reached for his tobacco pouch let the half-formed cigarette fall from his trembling fingers. It bounced when it hit the floor and all the wizards watched it roll with longing eyes until Albert stepped forward smartly and squashed it. Albert spun round. Rincewind, who had been following him as a sort of unofficial adjutant, nearly walked into him. \u0027You! Rincething! D\u0027yer smoke?\u0027 \u0027No, sir! Filthy habit!\u0027 Rincewind avoided the gaze of his superiors. He was suddenly aware that he had made some lifelong enemies, and it was no consolation to know that he probably wouldn\u0027t have them for very long. \u0027Right! Hold my staff. Now, you bunch of miserable back-sliders, this is going to stop, d\u0027yer hear? First thing tomorrow, up at dawn, three times round the quadrangle and back here for physical jerks! Balanced meals! Study! Healthy exercise! And that bloody monkey goes to a circus, first thing!\u0027 \u0027Oook?\u0027 Several of the older wizards shut their eyes. \u0027But first,\u0027 said Albert, lowering his voice, \u0027you\u0027ll oblige me by setting up the Rite of AshkEnte.\u0027 \u0027I have some unfinished business,\u0027 he added. Mort strode through the cat-black corridors of the pyramid, with Ysabell hurrying along behind him. The faint glow from his sword illuminated unpleasant things; Offler the Crocodile God was a cosmetics advert compared to some of the things the people of Tsort worshipped. In alcoves along the way were statues of creatures apparently built of all the bits God had left over. \u0027What are they here for?\u0027 whispered Ysabell. \u0027The Tsortean priests say they come alive when the pyramid is sealed and prowl the corridors to protect the body of the king from tomb robbers,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027What a horrible superstition.\u0027 \u0027Who said anything about superstition?\u0027 said Mort absently. \u0027They really come alive?\u0027 \u0027All I\u0027ll say is that when the Tsorteans put a curse on a place, they don\u0027t mess about.\u0027 Mort turned a corner and Ysabell lost sight of him for a heart-stopping moment. She scurried through the darkness and cannoned into him. He was examining a dog-headed bird. \u0027Urgh,\u0027 she said. \u0027Doesn\u0027t it send shivers up your spine?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Mort flatly. \u0027Why not?\u0027 BECAUSE I AM MORT. He turned, and she saw his eyes glow like blue pinpoints. \u0027Stop it!\u0027 I – CAN\u0027T. She tried to laugh. It didn\u0027t work. \u0027You\u0027re not Death,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re only doing his job.\u0027 DEATH is WHOEVER DOES DEATH\u0027S JOB. The shocked pause that followed this was broken by a groan from further along the dark passage. Mort turned on his heel and hurried towards it. He\u0027s right, thought Ysabell. Even the way he moves. . . . But the fear of the darkness that the light was dragging towards her overcame any other doubts and she crept after him, around another corner and into what appeared, in the fitful glow from the sword, to be a cross between a treasury and a very cluttered attic. \u0027What\u0027s this place?\u0027 she whispered. \u0027I\u0027ve never seen so much stuff!\u0027 THE KING TAKES IT WITH HIM INTO THE NEXT WORLD, said Mort. \u0027He certainly doesn\u0027t believe in travelling light. Look, there\u0027s a whole boat. And a gold bathtub!\u0027 DOUBTLESS HE WILL WISH TO KEEP CLEAN WHEN HE GETS THERE. \u0027And all those statues!\u0027 THOSE STATUES, I\u0027M SORRY TO SAY, WERE PEOPLE. SERVANTS FOR THE KING, YOU UNDERSTAND. Ysabell\u0027s face set grimly. THE PRIESTS GIVE THEM POISON. There was another groan, from the other side of the cluttered room. Mort followed it to its source, stepping awkwardly over rolls of carpet, bunches of dates, crates of crockery and piles of gems. The long obviously hadn\u0027t been able to decide what he was going to leave behind on his journey, so had decided to play safe and take everything. ONLY IT DOESNT ALWAYS WORK QUICKLY, Mort added sombrely. Ysabell clambered gamely after him, and peered over a canoe at a young girl sprawled across a pile of rugs. She was wearing gauze trousers, a waistcoat cut from not enough material, and enough bangles to moor a decent-sized ship. There was a green stain around her mouth. \u0027Does it hurt?\u0027 said Ysabell quietly. No. THEY THINK IT TAKES THEM TO PARADISE. \u0027Does it?\u0027 MAYBE. WHO KNOWS? Mort took the hourglass out of an inner pocket and inspected it by the gleam of the sword. He seemed to be counting to himself, and then with a sudden movement tossed the glass over his shoulder and brought the sword down with his other hand. The girl\u0027s shade sat up and stretched, with a clink of ghostly jewellery. She caught sight of Mort, and bowed her head. \u0027My lord!\u0027 NO-ONE\u0027S LORD, said Mort. NOW RUN ALONG TO WHEREVER YOU BELIEVE YOU\u0027RE GOING. \u0027I shall be a concubine at the heavenly court of King Zetesphut, who will dwell among the stars forever,\u0027 she said firmly. \u0027You don\u0027t have to be,\u0027 said Ysabell sharply. The girl turned to her, wide-eyed. \u0027Oh, but I must. I\u0027ve been training for it,\u0027 she said, as she faded from view. \u0027I\u0027ve only managed to be a handmaiden up till now.\u0027 She vanished. Ysabell stared with dark disapproval at the space she had occupied. \u0027Well!\u0027 she said, and, \u0027Did you see what she had on?\u0027 LET\u0027S GET OUT OF HERE. \u0027But it can\u0027t be true about King Whosis dwelling among the stars,\u0027 she grumbled as they found their way out of the crowded room. \u0027There\u0027s nothing but empty space up there.\u0027 IT\u0027S HARD TO EXPLAIN, said Mort. HE\u0027LL DWELL AMONG THE STARS IN HIS OWN MIND. \u0027With slaves?\u0027 IF THAT\u0027S WHAT THEY THINK THEY ARE. That\u0027s not very fair.\u0027 THERE\u0027S NO JUSTICE, said Mort. JUST us. They hurried back along the avenues of waiting ghouls and were nearly running when they burst out into the desert night air. Ysabell leaned against the rough stonework and panted for breath. Mort wasn\u0027t out of breath. He wasn\u0027t breathing. I WILL TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU WANT, he said, AND THEN I MUST LEAVE YOU. \u0027But I thought you wanted to rescue the princess!\u0027 Mort shook his head. I HAVE NO CHOICE. THERE ARE NO CHOICES. She ran forward and grabbed his arm as he turned towards the waiting Binky. He removed her hand gently. I HAVE FINISHED MY APPRENTICESHIP. \u0027It\u0027s all in your own mind!\u0027 yelled Ysabell. \u0027You\u0027re whatever you think you are!\u0027 She stopped and looked down. The sand around Mort\u0027s feet was beginning to whip up in little spurts and twirling dust devils. There was a crackle in the air, and a greasy feel. Mort looked uneasy. SOMEONE is PERFORMING THE RITE OF ASH — It hit like a hammer, a force from out of the sky that blew the sand into a crater. There was a low buzzing and the smell of hot tin. Mort looked around himself in the gale of rushing sand, turning as if in a dream, alone in the calm centre of the gale. Lightning flashed in the whirling cloud. Deep inside his own mind he struggled to break free, but something had him in its grip and he could no more resist than a compass needle can ignore the compulsion to point towards the Hub. At last he found what he was searching for. It was a doorway edged in octarine light, leading to a short tunnel. There were figures at the other end, beckoning to him. I COME, he said, and then turned as he heard the sudden noise behind him. Eleven stone of young womanhood hit him squarely in the chest, lifting him off the ground. Mort landed with Ysabell kneeling on him, holding on grimly to his arms. LET ME GO, he intoned. I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED. \u0027Not you, idiot!\u0027 She stared into the blue, pupil-less pools of his eyes. It was like looking down a rushing tunnel. Mort arched his back and screamed a curse so ancient and virulent that in the strong magical field it actually took on a form, flapped its leathery wings and slunk away. A private thunderstorm crashed around the sand dunes. His eyes drew her again. She looked away before she dropped like a stone down a well made of blue light. I COMMAND YOU. Mort\u0027s voice could have cut holes in rock. \u0027Father tried that tone on me for years,\u0027 she said calmly. \u0027Generally when he wanted me to clean my bedroom. It didn\u0027t work then, either.\u0027 Mort screamed another curse, which flopped out of the air and tried to bury itself in the sand. THE PAIN — \u0027It\u0027s all in your head,\u0027 she said, bracing herself against the force that wanted to drag them towards that flickering doorway. \u0027You\u0027re not Death. You\u0027re just Mort. You\u0027re whatever I think you are.\u0027 In the centre of the blurred blueness of his eyes were two tiny brown dots, rising at the speed of sight. The storm around them rose and wailed. Mort screamed. The Rite of AshkEnte, quite simply, summons and binds Death. Students of the occult will be aware that it can be performed with a simple incantation, three small bits of wood and 4cc of mouse blood, but no wizard worth his pointy hat would dream of doing anything so unimpressive; they knew in their hearts that if a spell didn\u0027t involve big yellow candles, lots of rare incense, circles drawn on the floor with eight different colours of chalk and a few cauldrons around the place then it simply wasn\u0027t worth contemplating. The eight wizards at their stations on the points of the great ceremonial octogram swayed and chanted, their arms held out sideways so they were just touching the fingertips of the mages on either side. But something was going wrong. True, a mist had formed in the very centre of the living octogram, but it was writhing and turning in on itself, refusing to focus. \u0027More power!\u0027 shouted Albert. \u0027Give it more power!\u0027 A figure appeared momentarily in the smoke, black-robed and holding a glittering sword. Albert swore as he caught a glimpse of the pale face under the cowl; it wasn\u0027t pale enough. \u0027No!\u0027 Albert yelled, ducking into the octogram and flailing at the flickering shape with his hands. \u0027Not you, not you. . . .\u0027 And, in faraway Tsort, Ysabell forgot she was a lady, bunched her fist, narrowed her eyes and caught Mort squarely on the jaw. The world around her exploded. . . . In the kitchen of Harga\u0027s House of Ribs the frying pan crashed to the floor, sending the cats scurrying out of the door. . . . In the great hall of the Unseen University everything happened at once.[9] The tremendous force the wizards had been exerting on the shadow realm suddenly had one focus. Like a reluctant cork from a bottle, like a dollop of fiery ketchup from the upturned sauce bottle of Infinity, Death landed in the octogram and swore. Albert realised just too late that he was inside the charmed ring and made a dive for the edge. But skeletal fingers caught him by the hem of his robe. The wizards, such of them who were still on their feet and conscious, were rather surprised to see that Death was wearing an apron and holding a small kitten. \u0027Why did you have\u0027 TO SPOIL IT ALL? \u0027Spoil it all? Have you seen what the lad has done?\u0027 snapped Albert, still trying to reach the edge of the ring. Death raised his skull and sniffed the air. The sound cut through all the other noises in the hall and forced them into silence. It was the kind of noise that is heard on the twilight edges of dreams, the sort that you wake from in a cold sweat of mortal horror. It was the snuffling under the door of dread. It was like the snuffling of a hedgehog, but if so then it was the kind of hedgehog that crashes out of the verges and flattens lorries. It was the kind of noise you wouldn\u0027t want to hear twice; you wouldn\u0027t want to hear it once.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-30.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.
