{"id":95344,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\u0027I think there\u0027s some people here to see you,\u0027 said Mort, and hurried away. As he reached the passageway the Vizier\u0027s soul started to scream. . . .\\n\\n Ysabell was standing patiently by Binky, who was making a late lunch of a five-hundred-year-old bonsai tree.\\n\\n \u0027One down,\u0027 said Mort, climbing into the saddle. \u0027Come on. I\u0027ve got a bad feeling about the next one, and we haven\u0027t much time.\u0027\\n\\n Albert materialised in the centre of Unseen University, in the same place, in fact, from which he had departed the world some two thousand years before.\\n\\n He grunted with satisfaction and brushed a few specks of dust off his robe.\\n\\n He became aware that he was being watched; on looking up, he discovered that he had flashed into existence under the stern marble gaze of himself.\\n\\n He adjusted his spectacles and peered disapprovingly at the bronze plaque screwed to his pedestal. It said:\\n\\n \u0027Alberto Malich, Founder of This University. AM 1,222-1,289. “We Will Not See His Like Again”.\u0027\\n\\n So much for prediction, he thought. And if they thought so much of him they could at least have hired a decent sculptor. It was disgraceful. The nose was all wrong. Call that a leg? People had been carving their names on it, too. He wouldn\u0027t be seen dead in a hat like that, either. Of course, if he could help it, he wouldn\u0027t be seen dead at all.\\n\\n Albert aimed an octarine thunderbolt at the ghastly thing and grinned evilly as it exploded into dust.\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 he said to the Disc at large, \u0027I\u0027m back.\u0027 The tingle from the magic coursed all the way up his arm and started a warm glow in his mind. How he\u0027d missed it, all these years.\\n\\n Wizards came hurrying through the big double doors at the sound of the explosion and cleared the wrong conclusion from a standing start.\\n\\n There was the pedestal, empty. There was a cloud of marble dust over everything. And striding out of it, muttering to himself, was Albert.\\n\\n The wizards at the back of the crowd started to have it away as quickly and quietly as possible. There wasn\u0027t one of them that hadn\u0027t, at some time in his jolly youth, put a common bedroom utensil on old Albert\u0027s head or carved his name somewhere on the statue\u0027s chilly anatomy, or spilled beer on the pedestal. Worse than that, too, during Rag Week when the drink flowed quickly and the privy seemed too far to stagger. These had all seemed hilarious ideas at the time. They suddenly didn\u0027t, now.\\n\\n Only two figures remained to face the statue\u0027s wrath, one because he had got his robe caught in the door and the other because he was, in fact, an ape and could therefore take a relaxed attitude to human affairs.\\n\\n Albert grabbed the wizard, who was trying desperately to walk into the wall. The man squealed.\\n\\n \u0027All right, all right, I admit it! I was drunk at the time, believe me, didn\u0027t mean it, gosh, I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m so sorry —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are you bleating about, man?\u0027 said Albert, genuinely puzzled.\\n\\n \u0027— so sorry, if I tried to tell you how sorry I am we\u0027d —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stop this bloody nonsense!\u0027 Albert glanced down at the little ape, who gave him a warm friendly smile. \u0027What\u0027s your name, man?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir, I\u0027ll stop, sir, right away, no more nonsense, sir . . . Rincewind, sir. Assistant librarian, if it\u0027s all right by you.\u0027\\n\\n Albert looked him up and down. The man had a desperate scuffed look, like something left out for the laundry. He decided that if this was what wizarding had come to, someone ought to do something about it.\\n\\n \u0027What sort of librarian would have you for assistant?\u0027 he demanded irritably.\\n\\n \u0027Oook.\u0027\\n\\n Something like awarm soft leather glove tried to hold his hand.\\n\\n \u0027A monkey! In my university!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Orang-outang, sir. He used to be a wizard but got caught in some magic, sir, now he won\u0027t let us turn him back, and he\u0027s the only one who knows where all the books are,\u0027 said Rincewind urgently. \u0027I look after his bananas,\u0027 he added, feeling some additional explanation was called for.\\n\\n Albert glared at him. \u0027Shut up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shutting up right away, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And tell me where Death is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Death, sir?\u0027 said Rincewind, backing against the wall.\\n\\n Tall, skeletal, blue eyes, stalks, TALKS LIKE THIS . . . Death. Seen him lately?\u0027\\n\\n Rincewind swallowed. \u0027Not lately, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I want him. This nonsense has got to stop. I\u0027m going to stop it now, see? I want the eight most senior wizards assembled here, right, in half an hour with all the necessary equipment to perform the Rite of AshkEnte, is that understood? Not that the sight of you lot gives me any confidence. Bunch of pantywaisters the lot of you, and stop trying to hold my hand!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oook.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And now I\u0027m going to the pub,\u0027 snapped Albert. \u0027Do they sell any halfway decent cat\u0027s piss anywhere these days?\u0027\\n\\n There\u0027s the Drum, sir,\u0027 said Rincewind.\\n\\n \u0027The Broken Drum? In Filigree Street? Still there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, they change the name sometimes and rebuild it completely but the site has been, er, on the site for years. I expect you\u0027re pretty dry, eh, sir?\u0027 Rincewind said, with an air of ghastly camaraderie.\\n\\n \u0027What would you know about it?\u0027 said Albert sharply.\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely nothing, sir,\u0027 said Rincewind promptly.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going to the Drum, then. Half an hour, mind. And if they\u0027re not waiting for me when I come back, then well, they\u0027d just better be!\u0027\\n\\n He stormed out of the hall in a cloud of marble dust.\\n\\n Rincewind watched him go. The librarian held his hand.\\n\\n \u0027You know the worst of it?\u0027 said Rincewind.\\n\\n \u0027Oook?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t even remember walking under a mirror.\u0027\\n\\n At about the time Albert was in The Mended Drum arguing with the landlord over a yellowing bar tab that had been handed down carefully from father to son through one regicide, three civil wars, sixty-one major fires, four hundred and ninety robberies and more than fifteen thousand barroom brawls to record the fact that Alberto Malich still owed the management three copper pieces plus interest currently standing at the contents of most of the Disc\u0027s larger strongrooms, which proved once again that an Ankhian merchant with an unpaid bill has the kind of memory that would make an elephant blink . . . at about this time, Binky was leaving a vapour trail in skies above the great mysterious continent of Klatch.\\n\\n Far below drums sounded in the scented, shadowy jungles and columns of curling mist rose from hidden rivers where nameless beasts lurked under the surface and waited for supper to walk past.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no more cheese, you\u0027ll have to have the ham,\u0027 said Ysabell. \u0027What\u0027s that light over there?\u0027\\n\\n The Light Dams,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027We\u0027re getting closer.\u0027 He pulled the hourglass out of his pocket and checked the level of the sand.\\n\\n \u0027But not close enough, dammit!\u0027\\n\\n The Light Dams lay like pools of light hubwards of their course, which is exactly what they were; some of the tribes constructed mirror walls in the desert mountains to collect the Disc sunlight, which is slow and slightly heavy. It was used as currency.\\n\\n Binky glided over the campfires of the nomads and the silent marshes of the Tsort river. Ahead of them dark, familiar shapes began to reveal themselves in the moonlight.\\n\\n The Pyramids of Tsort by moonlight!\u0027 breathed Ysabell, \u0027How romantic!\u0027\\n\\n MORTARED WITH THE BLOOD OF THOUSANDS OF SLAVES, observed Mort.\\n\\n \u0027Please don\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but the practical fact of the matter is that these —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, all right, you\u0027ve made your point,\u0027 said Ysabell irritably.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a lot of effort to go to to bury a dead king,\u0027 said Mort, as they circled above one of the smaller pyramids. They fill them full of preservative, you know, so they\u0027ll survive into the next world.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does it work?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not noticeably.\u0027 Mort leaned over Binky\u0027s neck. \u0027Torches down there,\u0027 he said. \u0027Hang On.\u0027\\n\\n A procession was winding away from the avenue of pyramids, led by a giant statue of Offler the Crocodile God borne by a hundred sweating slaves. Binky cantered above it, entirely unnoticed, and performed a perfect four-point landing on the hard-packed sand outside the pyramid\u0027s entrance.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve pickled another king,\u0027 said Mort. He examined the glass again in the moonlight. It was quite plain, not the sort normally associated with royalty.\\n\\n That can\u0027t be him,\u0027 said Ysabell. They don\u0027t pickle them when they\u0027re still alive, do they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I hope not, because I read where, before they do the preserving, they, um, cut them open and remove —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to hear it —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027— all the soft bits,\u0027 Mort concluded lamely. \u0027It\u0027s just as well the pickling doesn\u0027t work, really, just imagine having to walk around with no —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So it isn\u0027t the king you\u0027ve come to take,\u0027 said Ysabell loudly. \u0027Who is it, then?\u0027\\n\\n Mort turned towards the dark entrance. It wouldn\u0027t be sealed until dawn, to give time for the dead king\u0027s soul to leave. It looked deep and foreboding, hinting at purposes considerably more dire than, say, keeping a razor blade nice and sharp.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s find out,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Look out! He\u0027s coming back!\u0027\\n\\n The University\u0027s eight most senior wizards shuffled into line, tried to smooth out their beards and in general made an unsuccessful effort to look presentable. It wasn\u0027t easy. They had been snatched from their workrooms, or a postprandial brandy in front of a roaring fire, or quiet contemplation under a handkerchief in a comfy chair somewhere, and all of them were feeling extremely apprehensive and rather bewildered. They kept glancing at the empty pedestal.\\n\\n Only one creature could have duplicated the expressions on their faces, and that would be a pigeon who has heard not only that Lord Nelson has got down off his column but has also been seen buying a 12-bore repeater and a box of cartridges.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s coming up the corridor!\u0027 shouted Rincewind, and dived behind a pillar.\\n\\n The assembled mages watched the big double doors as if they were about to explode, which shows how prescient they were, because they exploded. Matchstick-sized bits of oak rained down among them and a small thin figure stood outlined against the light. It held a smoking staff in one hand. The other held a small yellow toad.\\n\\n \u0027Rincewind!\u0027 bawled Albert.\\n\\n \u0027Sir!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Take this thing away and dispose of it.\u0027\\n\\n The toad crawled into Rincewind\u0027s hand and gave him an apologetic look.\\n\\n That\u0027s the last time that bloody landlord gives any lip to a wizard,\u0027 said Albert with smug satisfaction. \u0027It seems I turn my back for a few hundred years and suddenly people in this town are encouraged to think they can talk back to wizards, eh?\u0027\\n\\n One of the senior wizards mumbled something.\\n\\n \u0027What was that? Speak up, that man!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As the bursar of this university I must say that we\u0027ve always encouraged a good neighbour policy with respect to the community,\u0027 mumbled the wizard, trying to avoid Albert\u0027s gimlet stare. He had an upturned chamber pot on his conscience, with three cases of obscene graffiti to be taken into consideration.\\n\\n Albert let his mouth drop open. \u0027Why?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Well, er, a sense of civic duty, we feel it\u0027s vitally important that we show an examp— arrgh!\u0027\\n\\n The wizard tried desperately to beat out the flames in his beard. Albert lowered his staff and looked slowly along the row of mages. They swayed away from his stare like grass in a gale.\\n\\n \u0027Anyone else want to show a sense of civic duty?\u0027 he said. \u0027Good neighbours, anybody?\u0027 He drew himself up to his full height. \u0027You spineless maggots! I didn\u0027t found this University so you could lend people the bloody lawnmower! What\u0027s the use of having the power if you don\u0027t wield it? Man doesn\u0027t show you respect, you don\u0027t leave enough of his damn inn to roast chestnuts on, understand?\u0027\\n\\n Something like a soft sigh went up from the assembled wizards. They stared sadly at the toad in Rincewind\u0027s hand. Most of them, in the days of their youth, had mastered the art of getting rascally drunk at the Drum. Of course, all that was behind them now, but the Guild of Merchants\u0027 annual knife-and-fork supper would have been held in the Drum\u0027s upstairs room the following evening, and all the Eighth Level wizards had been sent complimentary tickets; there would have been roast swan and two kinds of trifle and lots of fraternal toasts to \u0027Our esteemed, nay, distinguished guests\u0027 until it was time for the college porters to turn up with the wheelbarrows. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-29.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) \\n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \\n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
