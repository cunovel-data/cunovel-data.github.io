{"id":95340,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"\u0027Oh, I know about that. My father told me all about that when we used to take the thargas to be mated. When a man and a woman —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About the universe is what I meant,\u0027 said Albert hurriedly. \u0027I mean, have you ever thought about it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know the Disc is carried through space on the backs of four elephants that stand on the shell of Great A\u0027Tuin,\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s just part of it. I meant the whole universe of time and space and life and death and day and night and everything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t say I\u0027ve ever given it much thought,\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027Ah. You ought. The point is, the nodes are part of it. They stop death from getting out of control, see. Not him, not Death. Just death itself. Like, uh —\u0027 Albert struggled for words – \u0027like, death should come exactly at the end of life, see, and not before or after, and the nodes have to be worked out so that the key figures . . . you\u0027re not taking this in, are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve got to be worked out,\u0027 said Albert flatly, \u0027and then the correct lives have got to be got. The hourglasses, you call them. The actual Duty is the easy job.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you do it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Can you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027\\n\\n Albert sucked reflectively at his peppermint. That\u0027s the whole world in the gyppo, then,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Look, I can\u0027t see why you\u0027re so worried. I expect he\u0027s just got held up somewhere,\u0027 said Mort, but it sounded feeble even to him. It wasn\u0027t as though people buttonholed Death to tell him another story, or clapped him on the back and said things like \u0027You\u0027ve got time for a quick half in there, my old mate, no need to rush off home\u0027 or invited him to make up a skittles team and come out for a Klatchian take-away afterwards, or . . . It struck Mort with sudden, terrible poignancy that Death must be the loneliest creature in the universe. In the great party of Creation, he was always in the kitchen.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know what\u0027s come over the master lately,\u0027 mumbled Albert. \u0027Out of the chair, my girl. Let\u0027s have a look at these nodes.\u0027\\n\\n They opened the ledger.\\n\\n They looked at it for a long time.\\n\\n Then Mort said, \u0027What do all those symbols mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sodomy non sapiens,\u0027 said Albert under his breath.\\n\\n \u0027What does that mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Means I\u0027m buggered if I know.\u0027\\n\\n That was wizard talk, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027You shut up about wizard talk. I don\u0027t know anything about wizard talk. You apply your brain to this here.\u0027\\n\\n Mort looked down again at the tracery of lines. It was as if a spider had spun a web on the page, stopping at every junction to make notes. Mort stared until his eyes hurt, waiting for some spark of inspiration. None volunteered.\\n\\n \u0027Any luck?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all Klatchian to me,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I don\u0027t even know whether it should be read upside down or sideways.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Spiralling from the centre outwards,\u0027 sniffed Ysabell from her seat in the corner.\\n\\n Their heads collided as they both peered at the centre of the page. They stared at her. She shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027Father taught me how to read the node chart,\u0027 she said, \u0027when I used to do my sewing in here. He used to read bits out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can help?\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Ysabell. She blew her nose.\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean, no?\u0027 growled Albert. This is too important for any flighty —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I mean,\u0027 said Ysabell, in razor tones, \u0027that I can do them and you can help.\u0027\\n\\n The Ankh-Morpork Guild of Merchants has taken to hiring large gangs of men with ears like fists and fists like large bags of walnuts whose job it is to re-educate those misguided people who publicly fail to recognise the many attractive points of their fine city. For example the philosopher Catroaster was found floating face downward in the river within hours of uttering the famous line, \u0027When a man is tired of Ankh-Morpork, he is tired of ankle-deep slurry.\u0027\\n\\n Therefore it is prudent to dwell on one – of the very many, of course – on one of the things that makes Ankh-Morpork renowned among the great cities of the multiverse.\\n\\n This is its food.\\n\\n The trade routes of half the Disc pass through the city or down its rather sluggish river. More than half the tribes and races of the Disc have representatives dwelling within its sprawling acres. In Ankh-Morpork the cuisines of the world collide: on the menu are one thousand types of vegetable, fifteen hundred cheeses, two thousand spices, three hundred types of meat, two hundred fowl, five hundred different kinds of fish, one hundred variations on the theme of pasta, seventy eggs of one kind or another, fifty insects, thirty molluscs, twenty assorted snakes and other reptiles, and something pale brown and warty known as the Klatchian migratory bog truffle.\\n\\n Its eating establishments range from the opulent, where the portions are tiny but the plates are silver, to the secretive, where some of the Disc\u0027s more exotic inhabitants are rumoured to eat anything they can get down their throat best out of three.\\n\\n Harga\u0027s House of Ribs down by the docks is probably not numbered among the city\u0027s leading eateries, catering as it does for the type of beefy clientele that prefers quantity and breaks up the tables if it doesn\u0027t get it. They don\u0027t go in for the fancy or exotic, but stick to conventional food like flightless bird embryos, minced organs in intestine skins, slices of hog flesh and burnt ground grass seeds dipped in animal fats; or, as it is known in their patois, egg, soss and bacon and a fried slice.\\n\\n It was the kind of eating house that didn\u0027t need a menu. You just looked at Harga\u0027s vest.\\n\\n Still, he had to admit, this new cook seemed to be the business. Harga, an expansive advert for his own high carbohydrate merchandise, beamed at a room full of satisfied customers. And a fast worker, too! In fact, disconcertingly fast.\\n\\n He rapped on the hatch.\\n\\n \u0027Double egg, chips, beans, and a trollburger, hold the onions,\u0027 he rasped.\\n\\n RIGHT.\\n\\n The hatch slid up a few seconds later and two plates were pushed through. Harga shook his head in gratified amazement.\\n\\n It had been like that all evening. The eggs were bright and shiny, the beans glistened like rubies, and the chips were the crisp golden brown of sunburned bodies on expensive beaches. Harga\u0027s last cook had turned out chips like little paper bags full of pus.\\n\\n Harga looked around the steamy cafe. No-one was watching him. He was going to get to the bottom of this. He rapped on the hatch again.\\n\\n \u0027Alligator sandwich,\u0027 he said. \u0027And make it sna —\u0027\\n\\n The hatch shot up. After a few seconds to pluck up enough courage, Harga peered under the top slice of the long sarny in front of him. He wasn\u0027t saying that it was alligator, and he wasn\u0027t saying it wasn\u0027t. He knuckled the hatch again.\\n\\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 he said, I\u0027m not complaining, I just want to know how you did it so fast.\u0027\\n\\n TIME IS NOT IMPORTANT.\\n\\n \u0027You say?\u0027\\n\\n RIGHT.\\n\\n Harga decided not to argue.\\n\\n \u0027Well, you\u0027re doing a damn fine job in there, boy,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n WHAT is IT CALLED WHEN YOU FEEL WARM AND CONTENT AND WISH THINGS WOULD STAY THAT WAY?\\n\\n \u0027I guess you\u0027d call it happiness,\u0027 said Harga.\\n\\n Inside the tiny, cramped kitchen, strata\u0027d with the grease of decades, Death spun and whirled, chopping, slicing and flying. His skillet flashed through the fetid steam.\\n\\n He\u0027d opened the door to the cold night air, and a dozen neighbourhood cats had strolled in, attracted by the bowls of milk and meat – some of Harga\u0027s best, if he\u0027d known – that had been strategically placed around the floor. Occassionally Death would pause in his work and scratch one of them behind the ears.\\n\\n \u0027Happiness,\u0027 he said, and puzzled at the sound of his own voice.\\n\\n Cutwell, the wizard and Royal Recogniser by appointment, pulled himself up the last of the tower steps and leaned against the wall, waiting for his heart to stop thumping.\\n\\n Actually it wasn\u0027t particularly high, this tower, just high for Sto Lat. In general design and outline it looked the standard sort of tower for imprisoning princesses in; it was mainly used to store old furniture.\\n\\n However, it offered unsurpassed views of the city and the Sto plain, which is to say, you could see an awful lot of cabbages.\\n\\n Cutwell made it as far as the crumbling crenel-lations atop the wall and looked out at the morning haze. It was, maybe, a little hazier than usual. If he tried hard he could imagine a flicker in the sky. If he really strained his imagination he could hear a buzzing out over the cabbage fields, a sound like someone frying locusts. He shivered.\\n\\n At a time like this his hands automatically patted his pockets, and found nothing but half a bag of jelly babies, melted into a sticky mass, and an apple core. Neither offered much consolation.\\n\\n What Cutwell wanted was what any normal wizard wanted at a time like this, which was a smoke. He\u0027d have killed for a cigar, and would have gone as far as a flesh wound for a squashed dog-end. He pulled himself together. Resolution was good for the moral fibre; the only trouble was the fibre didn\u0027t appreciate the sacrifices he was making for it. They said that a truly great wizard should be permanently under tension. You could have used Cutwell for a bowstring.\\n\\n He turned his back on the brassica-ed landscape and made his way back down the winding steps to the main part of the palace.\\n\\n Still, he told himself, the campaign appeared to be working. The population didn\u0027t seem to be resisting the fact that there was going to be a coronation, although they weren\u0027t exactly clear about who was going to be crowned. There was going to be bunting in the streets and Cutwell had arranged for the town square\u0027s main fountain to run, if not with wine, then at least with an acceptable beer made from broccoli. There was going to be folk dancing, at sword point if necessary. There would be races for children. There would be an ox roast. The royal coach had been regilded and Cutwell was optimistic that people could be persuaded to notice it as it went by.\\n\\n The High Priest at the Temple of Blind Io was going to be a problem. Cutwell had marked him down as a dear old soul whose expertise with the knife was so unreliable that half of the sacrifices got tired of waiting and wandered away. The last time he\u0027d tried to sacrifice a goat it had time to give birth to twins before he could focus, and then the courage of motherhood had resulted in it chasing the entire priesthood out of the temple.\\n\\n The chances of him succeeding in putting the crown on the right person even in normal circumstances were only average, Cutwell had calculated; he\u0027d have to stand alongside the old boy and try tactfully to guide his shaking hands.\\n\\n Still, even that wasn\u0027t the big problem. The big problem was much bigger than that. The big problem had been sprung on him by the Chancellor after breakfast.\\n\\n \u0027Fireworks?\u0027 Cutwell had said.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s the sort of thing you wizard fellows are supposed to be good at, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said the Chancellor, as crusty as a week-old loaf. \u0027Flashes and bangs and whatnot. I remember a wizard when I was a lad —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know anything about fireworks,\u0027 said Cutwell, in tones designed to convey that he cherished this ignorance.\\n\\n \u0027Lots of rockets,\u0027 the Chancellor reminisced happily. \u0027Ankhian candles. Thunderflashes. And thingies that you can hold in your hand. It\u0027s not a proper coronation without fireworks.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but, you see —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good man,\u0027 said the Chancellor briskly, \u0027knew we could rely on you. Plenty of rockets, you understand, and to finish with there must be a set-piece, mind you, something really breathtaking like a portrait of – of —\u0027 his eyes glazed over in a way that was becoming depressingly familiar to Cut-well.\\n\\n \u0027The Princess Keli,\u0027 he said wearily.\\n\\n \u0027Ah. Yes. Her,\u0027 said the Chancellor. \u0027A portrait of – who you said – in fireworks. Of course, it\u0027s probably all pretty simple stuff to you wizards, but the people like it. Nothing like a good blowout and a blowup and a bit of balcony waving to keep the loyalty muscles in tip-top shape, that\u0027s what I always say. See to it. Rockets. With runes on.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-25.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) \\n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \\n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
