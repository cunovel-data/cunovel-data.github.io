{"id":95329,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u0027I demand to see the wizard,\u0027 she announced. \u0027Pray admit me this instant.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s rather busy at present,\u0027 said the face. \u0027Were you after a love potion?\u0027 \u0027A what?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve – we\u0027ve got a special on Cutwell\u0027s Shield of Passion ointment,\u0027 said the face, and winked in a startling fashion. \u0027Provides your wild oats while guaranteeing a crop failure, if you know what I mean.\u0027 Keli bridled. \u0027No,\u0027 she lied coldly, \u0027I do not.\u0027 \u0027Ramrub? Maidens\u0027 Longstop? Belladonna eyedrops?\u0027 \u0027I demand —\u0027 \u0027Sorry, we\u0027re closed,\u0027 said the face, and shut the door. Keli withdrew her foot just in time. She muttered some words that would have amazed and shocked her tutors, and thumped on the woodwork. The tattoo of her hammering suddenly slowed as realisation dawned. He\u0027d seen her! He\u0027d heard her! She beat on the door with renewed vigour, yelling with all the power in her lungs. A voice by her ear said, \u0027It won\u0027t work. He \u0027eef very fstubborn.\u0027 She looked around slowly and met the impertinent gaze of the doorknocker. It waggled its metal eyebrows at her and spoke indistinctly through its wrought-iron ring. \u0027I am Princess Keli, heir to the throne of Sto Lat,\u0027 she said haughtily, holding down the lid on her terror. \u0027And I don\u0027t talk to door furniture.\u0027 \u0027Fwell, I\u0027m just a doorknocker and I can talk to fwhoever I please,\u0027 said the gargoyle pleasantly. \u0027And I can ftell you the fmaster iff having a trying day and duff fnot fwant to be disturbed. But you could ftry to use the magic word,\u0027 it added. \u0027Coming from an attractiff fwoman it works nine times out of eight.\u0027 \u0027Magic word? What\u0027s the magic word?\u0027 The knocker perceptibly sneered. \u0027Haff you been taught nothing, miss?\u0027 She drew herself up to her full height, which wasn\u0027t really worth the effort. She felt she\u0027d had a trying day too. Her father had personally executed a hundred enemies in battle. She should be able to manage a doorknocker. \u0027I have been educated,\u0027 she informed it with icy precision, \u0027by some of the finest scholars in the land.\u0027 The doorknocker did not appear to be impressed. \u0027Iff they didn\u0027t teach you the magic word,\u0027 it said calmly, \u0027they couldn\u0027t haff fbeen all that fine.\u0027 Keli reached out, grabbed the heavy ring, and pounded it on the door. The knocker leered at her. \u0027Ftreat me rough,\u0027 it lisped. \u0027That\u0027f the way I like it!\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re disgusting!\u0027 \u0027Yeff. Ooo, that waff nife, do it again. . . .\u0027 The door opened a crack. There was a shadowy glimpse of curly hair. \u0027Madam, I said we\u0027re cl —\u0027 Keli sagged. \u0027Please help me,\u0027 she said. \u0027Please!\u0027 \u0027See?\u0027 said the doorknocker triumphantly. \u0027Sooner or later everyone remembers the magic word!\u0027 Keli had been to official functions in Ankh-Morpork and had met senior wizards from Unseen University, the Disc\u0027s premier college of magic. Some of them had been tall, and most of them had been fat, and nearly all of them had been richly dressed, or at least thought they were richly dressed. In fact there are fashions in wizardry as in more mundane arts, and this tendency to look like elderly aldermen was only temporary. Previous generations had gone in for looking pale and interesting, or druidical and grubby, or mysterious and saturnine. But Keli was used to wizards as a sort of fur-trimmed small mountain with a wheezy voice, and Igneous Cutwell didn\u0027t quite fit the mage image. He was young. Well, that couldn\u0027t be helped; presumably even wizards had to start off young. He didn\u0027t have a beard, and the only thing his rather grubby robe was trimmed with was frayed edges. \u0027Would you like a drink or something?\u0027 he said, surreptitiously kicking a discarded vest under the table. Keli looked around for somewhere to sit that wasn\u0027t occupied with laundry or used crockery, and shook her head. Cutwell noticed her expression. \u0027It\u0027s a bit alfresco, I\u0027m afraid,\u0027 he added hurriedly, elbowing the remains of a garlic sausage on to the floor. \u0027Mrs Nugent usually comes in twice a week and does for me but she\u0027s gone to see her sister who\u0027s had one of her turns. Are you sure? It\u0027s no trouble. I saw a spare cup here only yesterday.\u0027 \u0027I have a problem, Mr Cutwell,\u0027 said Keli. \u0027Hang on a moment.\u0027 He reached up to a hook over the fireplace and took down a pointy hat that had seen better days, although from the look of it they hadn\u0027t been very much better, and then said, \u0027Right. Fire away.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s so important about the hat?\u0027 \u0027Oh, it\u0027s very \u0027essential. You\u0027ve got to have the proper hat for wizarding. We wizards know about this sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027If you say so. Look, can you see me?\u0027 He peered at her. \u0027Yes. Yes, I would definitely say I can see you.\u0027 \u0027And hear me? You can hear me, can you?\u0027 \u0027Loud and clear. Yes. Every syllable tinkling into place. No problems.\u0027 \u0027Then would you be surprised if I told you that no-one else in this city can?\u0027 \u0027Except me?\u0027 Keli snorted. \u0027And your doorknocker.\u0027 Cutwell pulled out a chair and sat down. He squirmed a little. A thoughtful expression passed over his face. He stood up, reached behind him and produced a flat reddish mass which might have once been half a pizza[2]. He stared at it sorrowfully. \u0027I\u0027ve been looking for that all morning, would you believe?\u0027 he said. \u0027It was an Ail-On with extra peppers, too.\u0027 He picked sadly at the squashed shape, and suddenly remembered Keli. \u0027Gosh, sorry,\u0027 he said, \u0027where\u0027s my manners? Whatever will you think of me? Here. Have an anchovy. Please.\u0027 \u0027Have you been listening to me?\u0027 snapped Keli. \u0027Do you feel invisible? In yourself, I mean?\u0027 said Gutwell, indistinctly. \u0027Of course not. I just feel angry. So I want you to tell my fortune.\u0027 \u0027Well, I don\u0027t know about that, it all sounds rather medical to me and —\u0027 \u0027I can pay.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s illegal, you see,\u0027 said Cutwell wretchedly. \u0027The old king expressly forbade fortune telling in Sto Lat. He didn\u0027t like wizards much.\u0027 \u0027I can pay a lot.\u0027 \u0027Mrs Nugent was telling me this new girl is likely to be worse. A right haughty one, she said. Not the sort to look kindly on practitioners of the subtle arts, I fear.\u0027 Keli smiled. Members of the court who had seen that smile before would have hastened to drag Gutwell out of the way and into a place of safety, like the next continent, but he just sat there trying to pick bits of mushroom out of his robe. \u0027I understand she\u0027s got a foul temper on her,\u0027 said Keli. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if she didn\u0027t turn you out of the city anyway.\u0027 \u0027Oh dear,\u0027 said Cutwell, \u0027do you really think so?\u0027 \u0027Look,\u0027 said Keli, \u0027you don\u0027t have to tell my future, just my present. Even she couldn\u0027t object to that. I\u0027ll have a word with her if you like,\u0027 she added magnanimously. Cutwell brightened. \u0027Oh, do you know her?\u0027 he said. \u0027Yes. But sometimes, I think, not very well.\u0027 Cutwell sighed and burrowed around in the debris on the table, dislodging cascades of elderly plates and the long-mummified remains of several meals. Eventually he unearthed a fat leather wallet, stuck to a cheese slice. \u0027Well,\u0027 he said doubtfully, \u0027these are Caroc cards. Distilled wisdom of the Ancients and all that. Or there\u0027s the Ching Aling of the Hublandish. It\u0027s all the rage in the smart set. I don\u0027t do tealeaves.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll try the Ching thing.\u0027 \u0027You throw these yarrow stalks in the air, then.\u0027 She did. They looked at the ensuing pattern. \u0027Hmm,\u0027 said Cutwell after a while. \u0027Well, that\u0027s one in the fireplace, one in the cocoa mug, one in the street, shame about the window, one on the table, and one, no, two behind the dresser. I expect Mrs Nugent will be able to find the rest.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t say how hard. Shall I do it again?\u0027 \u0027No-ooo, I don\u0027t think so.\u0027 Cutwell thumbed through the pages of a yellowed book that had previously been supporting the table leg. \u0027The pattern seems to make sense. Yes, here we are, Octogram 8,887: Illegality, the Unatoning Goose. Which we cross reference here . . . hold on . . . hold on . . . yes. Got it.\u0027 \u0027Well?\u0027 \u0027Without vertically, wisely the cochineal emperor goes forth at teatime; at evening the mollusc is silent among the almond blossom.\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 said Keli, respectfully. \u0027What does that mean?\u0027 \u0027Unless you\u0027re a mollusc, probably not a lot,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027I think perhaps it lost something in translation.\u0027 \u0027Are you sure you know how to do this?\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s try the cards,\u0027 said Cutwell hurriedly, fanning them out. \u0027Pick a card. Any card.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s Death,\u0027said Keli. \u0027Ah. Well. Of course, the Death card doesn\u0027t actually mean death in all circumstances,\u0027 Cutwell said quickly. \u0027You mean, it doesn\u0027t mean death in those circumstances where the subject is getting over-excited and you\u0027re too embarrassed to tell the truth, hmm?\u0027 \u0027Look, take another card.\u0027 \u0027This one\u0027s Death as well,\u0027 said Keli. \u0027Did you put the other one back?\u0027 \u0027No. Shall I take another card?\u0027 \u0027May as well.\u0027 \u0027Well, there\u0027s a coincidence!\u0027 \u0027Death number three?\u0027 \u0027Right. Is this a special pack for conjuring tricks?\u0027 Keli tried to sound composed, but even she could detect the faint tinkle of hysteria in her voice. Cutwell frowned at her and carefully put the cards back in the pack, shuffled it, and dealt them out on to the table. There was only one Death. \u0027Oh dear,\u0027 he said, \u0027I think this is going to be serious. May I see the palm of your hand, please?\u0027 He examined it for a long time. Alter a while he went to the dresser, took a jeweller\u0027s eyeglass out of a drawer, wiped the porridge off it with the sleeve of his robe, and spent another few minutes examining her hand in minutest detail. Eventually he sat back, removed the glass, and stared at her. \u0027You\u0027re dead,\u0027 he said. Keli waited. She couldn\u0027t think of any suitable reply. \u0027I\u0027m not\u0027 lacked a certain style, while \u0027Is it serious?\u0027 seemed somehow too frivolous. \u0027Did I say I thought this was going to be serious?\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027I think you did,\u0027 said Keli carefully, keeping her tone totally level. \u0027I was right.\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 \u0027It could be fatal.\u0027 \u0027How much more fatal,\u0027 said Keli, \u0027than being dead?\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t mean for you.\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 \u0027Something very fundamental seems to have gone wrong, you see. You\u0027re dead in every sense but the, er, actual. I mean, the cards think you\u0027re dead. Your lifeline thinks you\u0027re dead. Everything and everyone thinks you\u0027re dead.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t,\u0027 said Keli, but her voice was less than confident. \u0027I\u0027m afraid your opinion doesn\u0027t count.\u0027 \u0027But people can see and hear me!\u0027 The first thing you learn when you enroll at Unseen University, I\u0027m afraid, is that people don\u0027t pay much attention to that sort of thing. It\u0027s what their minds tell them that\u0027s important.\u0027 \u0027You mean people don\u0027t see me because their minds tell them not to?\u0027 \u0027 \u0027Fraid so. It\u0027s called predestination, or something.\u0027 Cutwell looked at her wretchedly. \u0027I\u0027m a wizard. We know about these things.\u0027 \u0027Actually it\u0027s not the first thing you learn when you enroll,\u0027 he added, \u0027I mean, you learn where the lavatories are and all that sort of thing before that. But after all that, it\u0027s the first thing.\u0027 \u0027You can see me, though.\u0027 \u0027Ah. Well. Wizards are specially trained to see things that are there and not to see things that aren\u0027t. You get these special exercises —\u0027 Keli drummed her fingers on the table, or tried to. It turned out to be difficult. She stared down in vague horror. Cutwell hurried forward and wiped the table with his sleeve. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 he muttered, \u0027I had treacle sandwiches for supper last night.\u0027 \u0027What can I do?\u0027 \u0027Nothing.\u0027 \u0027Nothing?\u0027 \u0027Well, you could certainly become a very successful burglar . . . sorry. That was tasteless of me.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-14.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.
