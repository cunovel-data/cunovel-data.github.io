{"id":95347,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"The High Priest held up his hands for silence. Cutwell sidled towards him as the old man turned towards the Hub and in a cracked voice began the invocation to the gods.\\n\\n Cutwell let his eyes slip back towards the duke.\\n\\n \u0027Hear me, mm, O gods —\u0027\\n\\n Was Sto Helit looking up into the bat-haunted darkness of the rafters?\\n\\n \u0027— hear me, O Blind Io of the Hundred Eyes; hear me, O Great Offler of the Bird-Haunted Mouth: hear me, O Merciful Fate; hear me, O Cold, mm. Destiny; hear me, O Seven-handed Sek; hear me, O Hoki of the Woods; hear me, O —\u0027\\n\\n With dull horror Cutwell realised that the daft old fool, against all instruction, was going to mention the whole lot. There were more than nine hundred known gods on the Disc, and research theologians were discovering more every year. It could take hours. The congregation was already beginning to shuffle its feet.\\n\\n Keli was standing in front of the altar with a look of fury on her face. Cutwell nudged the High Priest in the ribs, which had no noticeable effect, and then waggled his eyebrows ferociously at the young acolyte.\\n\\n \u0027Stop him!\u0027 he hissed. \u0027We haven\u0027t got time!\u0027\\n\\n The gods would be displeased —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not as displeased as me, and I\u0027m here.\u0027\\n\\n The acolyte looked at Cutwell\u0027s expression for a moment and decided that he\u0027d better explain to the gods later. He tapped the High Priest on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear.\\n\\n \u0027— O Steikhegel, god of, mm, isolated cow byres; hear me, O – hello? What?\u0027\\n\\n Murmur, murmur.\\n\\n This is, mm, very irregular. Very well, we shall go straight to the, mm, Recitation of the Lineage.\u0027\\n\\n Murmur, murmur.\\n\\n The High Priest scowled at Cutwell, or at least where he believed Cutwell to be.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, all right. Mm, prepare the incense and fragrances for the Shriving of the Fourfold-Path.\u0027\\n\\n Murmur, murmur.\\n\\n The High Priest\u0027s face darkened.\\n\\n \u0027I suppose, mm, a short prayer, mm, is totally out of the question?\u0027 he said acidly.\\n\\n \u0027If some people don\u0027t get a move on,\u0027 said Keli demurely, \u0027there is going to be trouble.\u0027\\n\\n Murmur.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 said the High Priest. \u0027People might as well not bother with a religious, mm, ceremony at all. Fetch the bloody elephant, then.\u0027\\n\\n The acolyte gave Cutwell a frantic look and waved at the guards. As they urged their gently-swaying charge forward with shouts and pointed sticks the young priest sidled towards Cutwell and pushed something into his hand.\\n\\n He looked down. It was a waterproof hat.\\n\\n \u0027Is this necessary?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s very devout,\u0027 said the acolyte. \u0027We may need a snorkel.\u0027\\n\\n The elephant reached the altar and was forced, without too much difficulty, to kneel. It hiccupped.\\n\\n \u0027Well, where is it, then?\u0027 snapped the High Priest. \u0027Let\u0027s get this, mm, farce over with!\u0027\\n\\n Murmur went the acolyte. The High Priest listened, nodded gravely, picked up his white-handled sacrificial knife and raised it double-handed over his head. The whole hall watched, holding its breath. Then he lowered it again.\\n\\n \u0027Where in front of me?\u0027\\n\\n Murmur.\\n\\n \u0027I certainly don\u0027t need your help, my lad! I\u0027ve been sacrificing man and boy – and, mm, women and animals – for seventy years, and when I can\u0027t use the, mm, knife you can put me to bed with a shovel!\u0027\\n\\n And he brought the blade down in a wild sweep which, by sheer luck, gave the elephant a mild flesh wound on the trunk.\\n\\n The creature awoke from its pleasant reflective stupor and squealed. The acolyte turned in horror to look at two tiny bloodshot eyes squinting down the length of an enraged trunk, and cleared the altar in one standing jump.\\n\\n The elephant was enraged. Vague confusing recollections flooded its aching head, of fires and shouts and men with nets and cages and spears and too many years hauling heavy tree trunks. It brought its trunk down across the altar stone and somewhat to its own surprise smashed it in two, levered the two parts into the air with its tusks, tried unsuccessfully to uproot a stone pillar and then, feeling the sudden need for a breath of fresh air, started to charge arthritically down the length of the hall.\\n\\n It hit the door at a dead run, its blood loud with the call of the herd and fizzing with alcohol, and took it off at the hinges. Still wearing the frame on its shoulders it careened across the courtyard, smashed the outer gates, burped, thundered through the sleeping city and was still slowly accelerating when it sniffed the distant dark continent of Klatch on the night breeze and, tail raised, followed the ancient call of home.\\n\\n Back in the hall there was dust and shouts and confusion. Cutwell pushed his hat out of his eyes and got to his hands and knees.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Keli, who had been lying underneath him. \u0027And why did you jump on top of me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My first instinct was to protect you, your Majesty.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, instinct it may have been, but —\u0027 She started to say that maybe the elephant would have weighed less, but the sight of his big, serious and rather flushed face stopped her.\\n\\n \u0027We will talk about this later,\u0027 she said, sitting up and brushing the dust off her. \u0027In the meantime, I think we will dispense with the sacrifice. I\u0027m not your Majesty yet, just your Highness, and now if someone will fetch the crown —\u0027\\n\\n There was the snick of a safety catch behind them.\\n\\n The wizard will put his hands where I can see them,\u0027 said the duke.\\n\\n Cutwell stood up slowly, and turned around. The duke was backed by half a dozen large serious men, the type of men whose only function in life is to loom behind people like the duke. They had a dozen large serious crossbows, whose main purpose was to appear to be on the point of going off.\\n\\n The princess sprang to her feet and launched herself at her uncle, but Cutwell grabbed her.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said, quietly. This isn\u0027t the kind of man who ties you up in a cellar with just enough time for the mice to eat your ropes before the flood-waters rise. This is the kind of man who just kills you here and now.\u0027\\n\\n The duke bowed.\\n\\n \u0027I think it can be truly said that the gods have spoken,\u0027 he said. \u0027Clearly the princess was tragically crushed by the rogue elephant. The people will be upset. I will personally decree a week of mourning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t do that, all the guests have seen – !\u0027 the princess began, nearly in tears.\\n\\n Cutwell shook his head. He could see the guards moving through the crowds of bewildered guests.\\n\\n They haven\u0027t,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ll be amazed at what they haven\u0027t seen. Especially when they learn that being tragically crushed to death by rogue elephants can be catching. You can even die of it in bed.\u0027\\n\\n The duke laughed pleasantly.\\n\\n \u0027You really are quite intelligent for a wizard,\u0027 he said. \u0027Now, I am merely proposing banishment —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You won\u0027t get away with this,\u0027 said Cutwell. He thought for a bit, and added, \u0027Well, you will probably get away with it, but you\u0027ll feel bad about it on your deathbed and you\u0027ll wish —\u0027\\n\\n He stopped talking. His jaw dropped.\\n\\n The duke half turned to follow his gaze.\\n\\n \u0027Well, wizard? What have you seen?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You won\u0027t get away with it,\u0027 said Cutwell hysterically. \u0027You won\u0027t even be here. This is going to have never happened, do you realise?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Watch his hands,\u0027 said the duke. \u0027If he even moves his fingers, shoot them.\u0027\\n\\n He looked around again, puzzled. The wizard had sounded genuine. Of course, it was said wizards could see things that weren\u0027t there. . . .\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t even matter if you kill me,\u0027 Cutwell babbled, \u0027because tomorrow I\u0027ll wake up in my own bed and this won\u0027t have happened anyway. It\u0027s come through the wall!\u0027\\n\\n Night rolled onwards across the Disc. It was always there, of course, lurking in shadows and holes and cellars, but as the slow light of day drifted after the sun the pools and lakes of night spread out, met and merged. Light on the Discworld moves slowly because of the vast magical field.\\n\\n Light on the Discworld isn\u0027t like light elsewhere. It\u0027s grown up a bit, it\u0027s been around, it doesn\u0027t feel the need to rush everywhere. It knows that however fast it goes darkness always gets there first, so it takes it easy.\\n\\n Midnight glided across the landscape like a velvet bat. And faster than midnight, a tiny spark against the dark world of the Disc, Binky pounded after it. Flames roared back from his hooves. Muscles moved under his glistening skin like snakes in oil.\\n\\n They moved in silence. Ysabell took one arm from around Mort\u0027s waist and watched sparks glitter around her fingers in all eight colours of the rainbow. Little crackling serpents of light flowed down her arm and flashed off the tips of her hair.\\n\\n Mort took the horse down lower, leaving a boiling wake of cloud that extended for miles behind them.\\n\\n \u0027Now I know I\u0027m going mad,\u0027 he muttered.\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I just saw an elephant down there. Whoa, boy. Look, you can see Sto Lat up ahead.\u0027\\n\\n Ysabell peered over his shoulder at the distant gleam of light.\\n\\n \u0027How long have we got?\u0027 she said nervously.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. A few minutes, perhaps.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mort, I hadn\u0027t asked you before —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are you going to do when we get there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he said. \u0027I was sort of hoping something would suggest itself at the time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Has it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. But it isn\u0027t time yet. Albert\u0027s spell may help. And I—\u0027\\n\\n The dome of reality squatted over the palace like a collapsing jellyfish. Mort\u0027s voice trailed into horrified silence. Then Ysabell said, \u0027Well, I think it\u0027s nearly time. What are we going to do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hold tight!\u0027\\n\\n Binky glided through the smashed gates of the outer courtyard, slid across the cobbles in a trail of sparks and leapt through the ravaged doorway of the hall. The pearly wall of the interface loomed up and passed like a shock of cold spray.\\n\\n Mort had a confused vision of Keli and Cutwell and a group of large men diving for their lives. He recognised the features of the duke and drew his sword, vaulting from the saddle as soon as the steaming horse skidded to a halt.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you lay a finger on her!\u0027 he screamed. \u0027I\u0027ll have your head off!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is certainly most impressive,\u0027 said the duke, drawing his own sword. \u0027And also very foolish. I —\u0027\\n\\n He stopped. His eyes glazed over. He toppled forward. Cutwell put down the big silver candlestick he\u0027d wielded and gave Mort an apologetic smile.\\n\\n Mort turned towards the guards, the blue flame of Death\u0027s sword humming through the air.\\n\\n \u0027Anyone else want some?\u0027 he snarled. They backed away, and then turned and ran. As they passed through the interface they vanished. There were no guests outside there, either. In the real reality the hall was dark and empty.\\n\\n The four of them were left in a hemisphere that was rapidly growing smaller.\\n\\n Mort sidled over to Cutwell.\\n\\n \u0027Any ideas?\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ve got a magic spell here somewhere —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Forget it. If I try any magic in here now it\u0027ll blow our heads off. This little reality is too small to contain it.\u0027\\n\\n Mort sagged against the remains of the altar. He felt empty, drained. For a moment he watched the sizzling wall of the interface drifting nearer. He\u0027d survive it, he hoped, and so would Ysabell. Cutwell wouldn\u0027t, but a Cutwell would. Only Keli —\\n\\n \u0027Am I going to be crowned or not?\u0027 she said icily. \u0027I\u0027ve got to die a queen! It\u0027d be terrible to be dead and common!\u0027\\n\\n Mort gave her an unfocused look, trying to remember what on earth she was talking about. Ysabell fished around in the wreckage behind the altar, and came up with a rather battered gold circlet set with small diamonds.\\n\\n \u0027Is this it?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n That\u0027s the crown,\u0027 said Keli, nearly in tears. \u0027But there\u0027s no priest or anything.\u0027\\n\\n Mort sighed deeply.\\n\\n \u0027Cutwell, if this is our own reality we can rearrange it the way we want, can\u0027t we?\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-32.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) \\n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \\n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
