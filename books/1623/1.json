{"id":95316,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"This is the bright candlelit room where the life-timers are stored – shelf upon shelf of them, squat hourglasses, one for every living person, pouring their fine sand from the future into the past. The accumulated hiss of the falling grains makes the room roar like the sea. This is the owner of the room, stalking through it with a preoccupied air. His name is Death. But not any Death. This is the Death whose particular sphere of operations is, well, not a sphere at all, but the Discworld, which is flat and rides on the back of four giant elephants who stand on the shell of the enormous star turtle Great A\u0027Tuin, and which is bounded by a waterfall that cascades endlessly into space. Scientists have calculated that the chance of anything so patently absurd actually existing are millions to one. But magicians have calculated that million-to-one chances crop up nine times out of ten. Death clicks across the black and white tiled floor on toes of bone, muttering inside his cowl as his skeletal fingers count along the rows of busy hourglasses. Finally he finds one that seems to satisfy him, lifts it carefully from its shelf and carries it across to the nearest candle. He holds it so that the light lints off it, and stares at the little point of reflected brilliance. The steady gaze from those twinkling eye-sockets encompasses the world turtle, sculling through the deeps of space, carapace scarred by comets and pitted by meteors. One day even Great A\u0027Tuin will die, Death knows; now, that would be a challenge. But the focus of his gaze dives onwards towards the blue-green magnificence of the Disc itself, turning slowly under its tiny orbiting sun. Now it curves away towards the great mountain range called the Ramtops. The Ramtops are full of deep valleys and unexpected crags and considerably more geography than they know what to do with. They have their own peculiar weather, full of shrapnel rain and whiplash winds and permanent thunder-storms. Some people say it\u0027s all because the Ramtops are the home of old, wild magic. Mind you, some people will say anything. Death blinks, adjusts for depth of vision. Now he sees the grassy country on the turnwise slopes of the mountains. Now he sees a particular hillside. Now he sees a field. Now he sees a boy, running. Now he watches. Now, in a voice like lead slabs being dropped on granite, he says: YES. There was no doubt that there was something magical in the soil of that hilly, broken area which – because of the strange tint that it gave to the local flora – was known as the octarine grass country. For example, it was one of the few places on the Disc where plants produced reannual varieties. Reannuals are plants that grow backwards in time. You sow the seed this year and they grow last year. Mort\u0027s family specialised in distilling the wine from reannual grapes. These were very powerful and much sought after by fortune-tellers, since of course they enabled them to see the future. The only snag was that you got the hangover the morning before, and had to drink a lot to get over it. Reannual growers tended to be big, serious men, much given to introspection and close examination of the calendar. A farmer who neglects to sow ordinary seeds only loses the crop, whereas anyone who forgets to sow seeds of a crop that has already been harvested twelve months before risks disturbing the entire fabric of causality, not to mention acute embarrassment. It was also acutely embarrassing to Mort\u0027s family that the youngest son was not at all serious and had about the same talent for horticulture that you would find in a dead starfish. It wasn\u0027t that he was unhelpful, but he had the land of vague, cheerful helpfulness that serious men soon learn to dread. There was something infectious, possibly even fatal, about it. He was tall, red-haired and freckled, with the sort of body that seems to be only marginally under its owner\u0027s control; it appeared to have been built out of knees. On this particular day it was hurtling across the high fields, waving its hands and yelling. Mort\u0027s father and uncle watched it disconsolately from the stone wall. \u0027What I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 said father Lezek, \u0027is that the birds don\u0027t even fly away. I\u0027d fly away, if I saw it coining towards me.\u0027 \u0027Ah. The human body\u0027s a wonderful thing. I mean, his legs go all over the place but there\u0027s a fair turn of speed there.\u0027 Mort reached the end of a furrow. An overfull woodpigeon lurched slowly out of his way. \u0027His heart\u0027s in the right place, mind,\u0027 said Lezek, carefully. \u0027Ah. \u0027Course, \u0027tis the rest of him that isn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s clean about the house. Doesn\u0027t eat much,\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027No, I can see that.\u0027 Lezek looked sideways at his brother, who was staring fixedly at the sky. \u0027I did hear you\u0027d got a place going up at your farm, Hamesh,\u0027 he said. \u0027Ah. Got an apprentice in, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Lezek gloomily, \u0027when was that, then?\u0027 \u0027Yesterday,\u0027 said his brother, lying with rattlesnake speed. \u0027All signed and sealed. Sorry. Look, I got nothing against young Mort, see, he\u0027s as nice a boy as you could wish to meet, it\u0027s just that —\u0027 \u0027I know, I know,\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027He couldn\u0027t find his arse with both hands.\u0027 They stared at the distant figure. It had fallen over. Some pigeons had waddled over to inspect it. \u0027He\u0027s not stupid, mind,\u0027 said Hamesh. \u0027Not what you\u0027d call stupid.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s a brain there all right,\u0027 Lezek conceded. \u0027Sometimes he starts thinking so hard you has to hit him round the head to get his attention. His granny taught him to read, see. I reckon it overheated his mind.\u0027 Mort had got up and tripped over his robe. \u0027You ought to set him to a trade,\u0027 said Hamesh, reflectively. \u0027The priesthood, maybe. Or wizardry. They do a lot of reading, wizards.\u0027 They looked at each other. Into both their minds stole an inkling of what Mort might be capable of if he got his well-meaning hands on a book of magic. \u0027All right,\u0027 said Hamesh hurriedly. \u0027Something else, then. There must be lots of things he could turn his hand to.\u0027 \u0027He starts thinking too much, that\u0027s the trouble,\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027Look at him now. You don\u0027t think about how to scare birds, you just does it. A normal boy, I mean.\u0027 Hamesh scratched his chin thoughtfully. \u0027It could be someone else\u0027s problem,\u0027 he said. Lezek\u0027s expression did not alter, but there was a subtle change around his eyes. \u0027How do you mean?\u0027 he said. \u0027There\u0027s the hiring fair at Sheepridge next week. You set him as a prentice, see, and his new master\u0027ll have the job of knocking him into shape. \u0027Tis the law. Get him indentured, and \u0027tis binding.\u0027 Lezek looked across the field at his son, who was examining a rock. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t want anything to happen to him, mind,\u0027 he said doubtfully. \u0027We\u0027re quite fond of him, his mother and me. You get used to people.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027d be for his own good, you\u0027ll see. Make a man of him.\u0027 \u0027Ah. Well. There\u0027s certainly plenty of raw material,\u0027 sighed Lezek. Mort was getting interested in the rock. It had curly shells in it, relics of the early days of the world when the Creator had made creatures out of stone, no-one knew why. Mort was interested in lots of things. Why people\u0027s teeth fitted together so neatly, for example. He\u0027d given that one a lot of thought. Then there was the puzzle of why the sun came out during the day, instead of at night when the light would come in useful. He knew the standard explanation, which somehow didn\u0027t seem satisfying. In short, Mort was one of those people who are more dangerous than a bag full of rattlesnakes. He was determined to discover the underlying logic behind the universe. Which was going to be hard, because there wasn\u0027t one. The Creator had a lot of remarkably good ideas when he put the world together, but making it understandable hadn\u0027t been one of them. Tragic heroes always moan when the gods take an interest in them, but it\u0027s the people the gods ignore who get the really tough deals. His father was yelling at him, as usual. Mort threw the rock at a pigeon, which was almost too full to lurch out of the way, and wandered back across the field. And that was why Mort and his father walked down through the mountains into Sheepridge on Hogswatch Eve, with Mort\u0027s rather sparse possessions in a sack on the back of a donkey. The town wasn\u0027t much more than four sides to a cobbled square, lined with shops that provided all the service industry of the farming community. After five minutes Mort came out of the tailors wearing a loose fitting brown garment of imprecise function, which had been understandably unclaimed by a previous owner and had plenty of room for him to grow, on the assumption that he would grow into a nineteen-legged elephant. His father regarded him critically. \u0027Very nice,\u0027 he said, \u0027for the money.\u0027 \u0027It itches,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I think there\u0027s things in here with me.\u0027 There\u0027s thousands of lads in the world\u0027d be very thankful for a nice warm —\u0027 Lezek paused, and gave up – \u0027garment like that, my lad.\u0027 \u0027I could share it with them?\u0027 Mort said hopefully. \u0027You\u0027ve got to look smart,\u0027 said Lezek severely. \u0027You\u0027ve got to make an impression, stand out in the crowd.\u0027 There was no doubt about it. He would. They set out among the throng crowding the square, each listening to his own thoughts. Usually Mort enjoyed visiting the town, with its cosmopolitan atmosphere and strange dialects from villages as far away as five, even ten miles, but this time he felt unpleasantly apprehensive, as if he could remember something that hadn\u0027t happened yet. The fair seemed to work like this: men looking for work stood in ragged lines in the centre of the square. Many of them sported little symbols in their hats to tell the world the kind of work they were trained in – shepherds wore a wisp of wool, carters a hank of horsehair, interior decorators a strip of rather interesting hessian wallcovering, and so on. The boys seeking apprenticeships were clustered on the Hub side of the square. \u0027You just go and stand there, and someone comes and offers you an apprenticeship,\u0027 said Lezek, his voice trimmed with uncertainty. \u0027If they like the look of you, that is.\u0027 \u0027How do they do that?\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Well,\u0027 said Lezek, and paused. Hamesh hadn\u0027t explained about this bit. He drew on his limited knowledge of the marketplace, which was restricted to livestock sales, and ventured, \u0027I suppose they count your teeth and that. And make sure you don\u0027t wheeze and your feet are all right. I shouldn\u0027t let on about the reading, it unsettles people.\u0027 \u0027And then what?\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Then you go and learn a trade,\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027What trade in particular?\u0027 \u0027Well . . . carpentry is a good one,\u0027 Lezek hazarded. \u0027Or thievery. Someone\u0027s got to do it.\u0027 Mort looked at his feet. He was a dutiful son, when he remembered, and if being an apprentice was what was expected of him then he was determined to be a good one. Carpentry didn\u0027t sound very promising, though – wood had a stubborn life of its own, and a tendency to split. And official thieves were rare in the Ramtops, where people weren\u0027t rich enough to afford them. \u0027All right,\u0027 he said eventually, \u0027I\u0027ll go and give it a try. But what happens if I don\u0027t get prenticed?\u0027 Lezek scratched his head. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he said. \u0027I expect you just wait until the end of the fair. At midnight. I suppose.\u0027 And now midnight approached. A light frost began to crisp the cobblestones. In the ornamental clock tower that overlooked the square a couple of delicately-carved little automatons whirred out of trapdoors in the clockface and struck the quarter hour. Fifteen minutes to midnight. Mort shivered, but the crimson fires of shame and stubbornness flared up inside him, hotter than the slopes of Hell. He blew on his fingers for something to do and stared up at the freezing sky, trying to avoid the stares of the few stragglers among what remained of the fair.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-1.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.
