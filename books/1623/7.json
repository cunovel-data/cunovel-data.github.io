Why don\u0027t I?\u0027\n EMOTIONS GET LEFT BEHIND. IT\u0027S ALL A MATTER OF GLANDS.\n \u0027Ah. That would be it, I suppose. She can\u0027t see us, can she?\u0027\n NO.\n \u0027I suppose there\u0027s no chance that I could —?\u0027\n NONE, said Death.\n \u0027Only she\u0027s going to be queen, and if I could only let her—\u0027\n SORRY.\n The girl looked up and through Mort. He watched the duke walk up behind her and lay a comforting hand on her shoulder. A fault smile hovered around the man\u0027s lips. It was the sort of smile that lies on sandbanks waiting for incautious swimmers.\n I can\u0027t make you hear me, Mort said. Don\u0027t trust him!\n She peered at Mort, screwing up her eyes. He reached out, and watched his hand pass straight through hers.\n COME ALONG, BOY. NO LALLYGAGGING.\n Mort felt Death\u0027s hand tighten on his shoulder, not in an unfriendly fashion. He turned away reluctantly, following Death and the king.\n They walked out through the wall. He was halfway after them before he realised that walking through walls was impossible.\n The suicidal logic of this nearly killed him. He felt the chill of the stone around his limbs before a voice in his ear said:\n LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. THE WALL CANT BE THERE. OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN\u0027T BE WALKING THROUGH IT. WOULD YOU, BOY?\n \u0027Mort,\u0027 said Mort.\n WHAT?\n \u0027My name is Mort. Or Mortimer,\u0027 said Mort angrily, pushing forward. The chill fell behind him.\n THERE. THAT WASN\u0027T so HARD, WAS IT?\n Mort looked up and down the length of the corridor, and slapped the wall experimentally. He must have walked through it, but it felt solid enough now. Little specks of mica glittered at him.\n \u0027How do you do that stuff?\u0027 he said. \u0027How do I do it? Is it magic?\u0027\n MAGIC IS THE ONE THING IT ISN\u0027T, BOY. WHEN YOU CAN DO IT BY YOURSELF, THERE WILL BE NOTHING MORE THAT I CAN TEACH YOU.\n The king, who was considerably more diffuse now, said, \u0027It\u0027s impressive, I\u0027ll grant you. By the way, I seem to be fading.\u0027\n IT\u0027S THE MORPHOGENETIC FIELD WEAKENING, said Death.\n The king\u0027s voice was no louder than a whisper. \u0027Is that what it is?\u0027\n IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE. TRY TO ENJOY IT.\n \u0027How?\u0027 Now the voice was no more than a shape in the air. JUST BE YOURSELF.\n At that moment the king collapsed, growing smaller and smaller in the air as the field finally collapsed into a tiny, brilliant pinpoint. It happened so quickly that Mort almost missed it. From ghost to mote in half a second, with a faint sigh.\n Death gently caught the glittering thing and stowed it away somewhere under his robe.\n \u0027What\u0027s happened to him?\u0027 said Mort.\n ONLY HE KNOWS, said Death. COME.\n \u0027My granny says that dying is like going to sleep,\u0027 Mort added, a shade hopefully.\n I WOULDN\u0027T KNOW. I HAVE DONE NEITHER.\n Mort took a last look along the corridor. The big doors had been flung back and the court was spilling out. Two older women were endeavouring to comfort the princess, but she was striding ahead of them so that they bounced along behind her like a couple of fussy balloons. They disappeared up another corridor.\n ALREADY A QUEEN, said Death, approvingly. Death liked style.\n They were on the roof before he spoke again.\n You TRIED TO WARN HIM, he said, removing Binky\u0027s nosebag.\n \u0027Yes, sir. Sorry.\u0027\n YOU CANNOT INTERFERE WITH FATE. WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE WHO SHOULD LIVE AND WHO SHOULD DIE?\n Death watched Mort\u0027s expression carefully.\n ONLY THE GODS ARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT, he added. To TINKER WITH THE FATE OF EVEN ONE INDIVIDUAL COULD DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?\n Mort nodded miserably. \u0027Are you going to send me home?\u0027 he said. Death reached down and swung him up behind the saddle. BECAUSE YOU SHOWED COMPASSION? No. I MIGHT HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD SHOWN PLEASURE. BUT YOU MUST LEARN THE COMPASSION PROPER TO YOUR TRADE.\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 A SHARP EDGE.\n Days passed, although Mort wasn\u0027t certain how many. The gloomy sun of Death\u0027s world rolled regularly across the sky, but the visits to mortal space seemed to adhere to no particular system. Nor did Death visit only kings and important battles; most of the personal visits were to quite ordinary people.\n Meals were served up by Albert, who smiled to himself a lot and didn\u0027t say anything much. Ysabell kept to her room most of the time, or rode her own pony on the black moors above the cottage. The sight of her with her hair streaming in the wind would have been more impressive if she was a better horse-woman, or if the pony had been rather larger, or if her hair was the sort that streams naturally. Some hair has got it, and some hasn\u0027t. Hers hadn\u0027t.\n When he wasn\u0027t out on what Death referred to as THE DUTY Mort assisted Albert, or found jobs in the garden or stable, or browsed through Death\u0027s extensive library, reading with the speed and omnivorousness common to those who discover the magic of the written word for the first time.\n Most of the books in the library were biographies, of course.\n They were unusual in one respect. They were writing themselves. People who had already died, obviously, filled their books from cover to cover, and those who hadn\u0027t been born yet had to put up with blank pages. Those in between . . . Mort took note, marking the place and counting the extra lines, and estimated that some books were adding paragraphs at the rate of four or five every day. He didn\u0027t recognise the handwriting.\n And finally he plucked up his courage.\n A WHAT? said Death in astonishment, sitting behind his ornate desk and turning his scythe-shaped paperknife over and over in his hands.\n \u0027An afternoon off,\u0027 repeated Mort. The room suddenly seemed to be oppressively big, with himself very exposed in the middle of a carpet about the size of a field.\n BUT WHY? said Death. IT CANT BE TO ATTEND YOUR GRANDMOTHER\u0027S FUNERAL, he added. I WOULD KNOW.\n \u0027I just want to, you know, get out and meet people,\u0027 said Mort, trying to outstare that unflinching blue gaze.\n BUT YOU MEET PEOPLE EVERY DAY, protested Death.\n \u0027Yes, I know, only, well, not for very long,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I mean, it\u0027d be nice to meet someone with a life expectancy of more than a few minutes. Sir,\u0027 he added.\n Death drummed his fingers on the desk, making a sound not unlike a mouse tap-dancing, and gave Mort another few seconds of stare. He noticed that the boy seemed rather less elbows than he remembered, stood a little more upright and, bluntly, could use a word like \u0027expectancy\u0027. It was all that library.\n ALL RIGHT, he said grudgingly. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED RIGHT HERE. THE DUTY IS NOT ONEROUS, IS IT?\n \u0027No, sir.\u0027\n AND YOU HAVE GOOD FOOD AND A WARM BED AND RECREATION AND PEOPLE YOUR OWN AGE.\n \u0027Pardon, sir?\u0027 said Mort.\n MY DAUGHTER, said Death. YOU HAVE MET HER, I BELIEVE.\n \u0027Oh. Yes, sir.\u0027\n SHE HAS A VERY WARM PERSONALITY WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW HER.\n \u0027I am sure she has, sir.\u0027\n NEVERTHELESS, YOU WISH – Death launched the words with a spin of distaste – AN AFTERNOON OFF? \u0027Yes, sir. If you please, sir.\u0027\n VERY WELL. So BE IT. You MAY HAVE UNTIL SUNSET.\n Death opened his great ledger, picked up a pen, and began to write. Occasionally he\u0027d reach out and flick the beads of an abacus.\n After a minute he looked up.\n YOU\u0027RE STILL HERE, he said. AND IN YOUR OWN TIME, TOO, he added sourly.\n \u0027Um,\u0027 said Mort, \u0027will people be able to see me, sir?\u0027\n I IMAGINE SO, I\u0027M SURE, said Death. Is THERE ANYTHING ELSE I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU WITH BEFORE YOU LEAVE FOR THIS DEBAUCH?\n \u0027Well, sir, there is one thing, sir, I don\u0027t know how to get to the mortal world, sir,\u0027 said Mort desperately.\n Death sighed loudly, and pulled open a desk drawer.\n JUST WALK THERE.\n Mort nodded miserably, and took the long walk to the study door. As he pulled it open Death coughed.\n BOY! he called, and tossed something across the room.\n Mort caught it automatically as the door creaked open.\n The doorway vanished. The deep carpet underfoot became muddy cobbles. Broad daylight poured over him like quick-silver.\n \u0027Mort,\u0027 said Mort, to the universe at large.\n \u0027What?\u0027 said a stallholder beside him. Mort stared around. He was in a crowded market place, packed with people and animals. Every kind of thing was being sold from needles to (via a few itinerant prophets) visions of salvation. It was impossible to hold any conversation quieter than a shout.\n Mort tapped the stallholder in the small of the back.\n \u0027Can you see me?\u0027 he demanded.\n The stallholder squinted critically at him.\n \u0027I reckon so,\u0027 he said, \u0027or someone very much like you.\u0027\n Thank you,\u0027 said Mort, immensely relieved.\n \u0027Don\u0027t mention it. I see lots of people every day, no charge. Want to buy any bootlaces?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027What place is this?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t know?\u0027\n A couple of people at the next stall were looking at Mort thoughtfully. His mind went into overdrive.\n \u0027My master travels a lot,\u0027 he said, truthfully. \u0027We arrived last night, and I was asleep on the cart. Now I\u0027ve got the afternoon off.\u0027\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said the stallholder. He leaned forward conspiratorially. \u0027Looking for a good time, are you? I could fix you up.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d quite enjoy knowing where I am,\u0027 Mort conceded.\n The man was taken aback.\n \u0027This is Ankh-Morpork,\u0027 he said. \u0027Anyone ought to be able to see that. Smell it, too.\u0027\n Mort sniffed. There was a certain something about the air in the city. You got the feeling that it was air that had seen life. You couldn\u0027t help noting with every breath that thousands of other people were very close to you and nearly all of them had armpits.\n The stallholder regarded Mort critically, noting the pale face, well-cut clothes and strange presence, a sort of coiled spring effect.\n \u0027Look, I\u0027ll be frank,\u0027 he said. \u0027I could point you in the direction of a great brothel.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve already had lunch,\u0027 said Mort, vaguely. \u0027But you can tell me if we\u0027re anywhere near, I think it\u0027s called Sto Lat?\u0027\n \u0027About twenty miles Hubwards, but there\u0027s nothing there for a young man of your kidney,\u0027 said the trader hurriedly. \u0027I know, you\u0027re out by yourself, you want new experiences, you want excitement, romance —\u0027\n Mort, meanwhile, had opened the bag Death had given him. It was full of small gold coins, about the size of sequins.\n An image formed again in his mind, of a pale young face under a head of red hair who had somehow known he was there. The unfocused feelings that had haunted his mind for the last few days suddenly sharpened to a point.\n \u0027I want,\u0027 he said firmly, \u0027a very fast horse.\u0027\n Five minutes later, Mort was lost.\n This part of Ankh-Morpork was known as The Shades, an inner-city area sorely in need either of governmental help or, for preference, a flamethrower. It couldn\u0027t be called squalid because that would be stretching the word to breaking point. It was beyond squalor and out the other side, where by a sort of Einsteinian reversal it achieved a magnificent horribleness that it wore like an architectural award. It was noisy and sultry and smelled like a cowshed floor.\n It didn\u0027t so much have a neighbourhood as an ecology, like a great land-based coral reef. There were the humans, all right, humanoid equivalents of lobsters, squid, shrimps and so on. And sharks.\n Mort wandered hopelessly along the winding streets. Anyone hovering at rooftop height would have noticed a certain pattern in the crowds behind him, suggesting a number of men converging nonchalantly on a target, and would rightly have concluded that Mort and his gold had about the same life expectancy as a three-legged hedgehog on a six-lane motorway.\n It is probably already apparent that The Shades was not the sort of place to have inhabitants. It had denizens. Periodically Mort would try to engage one in conversation, to find the way to a good horse dealer. The denizen would usually mutter something and hurry away, since anyone wishing to live in The Shades for longer than maybe three hours developed very specialised senses indeed and would no more hang around near Mort than a peasant would stand near a tall tree in thundery weather. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-7.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Mort (Discworld #4) \n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
