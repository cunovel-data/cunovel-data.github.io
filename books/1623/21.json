{"id":95336,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"There was a click, the thwack of sinew against metal, a zip of air, and a groan. The groan came from Cutwell. Mort spun round to him. \u0027Are you all right?\u0027 he said. \u0027Did it hit you?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said the wizard, weakly. \u0027No, it didn\u0027t. How do you feel?\u0027 \u0027A bit tired. Why?\u0027 \u0027Oh, nothing. Nothing. No draughts anywhere? No slight leaking feelings?\u0027 \u0027No. Why?\u0027 \u0027Oh, nothing, nothing.\u0027 Cutwell turned and looked closely at the wall behind Mort. \u0027Aren\u0027t the dead allowed any peace?\u0027 said Keli bitterly. \u0027I thought one thing you could be sure of when you were dead was a good night\u0027s sleep.\u0027 She looked as though she had been crying. With an insight that surprised him, Mort realised that she knew this and that it was making her even angrier than before. That\u0027s not really fair,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ve come to help. Isn\u0027t that right, Cutwell?\u0027 \u0027Hmm?\u0027 said Cutwell, who had found the crossbow bolt buried in the plaster and was looking at it with deep suspicion. \u0027Oh, yes. He has. It won\u0027t work, though. Excuse me, has anyone got any string?\u0027 \u0027Help?\u0027 snapped Keli. \u0027Help? If it wasn\u0027t for you —\u0027 \u0027You\u0027d still be dead,\u0027 said Mort. She looked at him with her mouth open. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t know about it, though,\u0027 she said. That\u0027s the worst part.\u0027 \u0027I think you two had better go,\u0027 said Cutwell to the guards, who were trying to appear inconspicuous. \u0027But I\u0027ll have that spear, please. Thank you.\u0027 \u0027Look,\u0027 said Mort, \u0027I\u0027ve got a horse outside. You\u0027d be amazed. I can take you anywhere. You don\u0027t have to wait around here.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t know much about monarchy, do you,\u0027 said Keli. \u0027Um. No?\u0027 \u0027 She means better to be a dead queen in your own castle than a live commoner somewhere else,\u0027 said Cutwell, who had stuck the spear into the wall by the bolt and was trying to sight along it. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t work, anyway. The dome isn\u0027t centred on the palace, it\u0027s centred on her.\u0027 \u0027On who?\u0027 said Keli. Her voice could have kept milk fresh for a month. \u0027On her Highness,\u0027 said Cutwell automatically, squinting along the shaft. \u0027Don\u0027t you forget it.\u0027 \u0027I won\u0027t forget it, but that\u0027s not the point,\u0027 said he wizard. He pulled the bolt out of the plaster and tested the point with his finger. \u0027But if you stay here you\u0027ll die!\u0027 said Mort. Then I shall have to show the Disc how a queen can die,\u0027 said Keli, looking as proud as was possible in a pink knitted bed jacket. Mort sat down on the end of the bed with his head in his hands. \u0027I know how a queen can die,\u0027 he muttered. They die just like other people. And some of us would rather not see it happen.\u0027 \u0027Excuse me, I just want to look at this crossbow,\u0027 said Cutwell conversationally, reaching across them. \u0027Don\u0027t mind me.\u0027 \u0027I shall go proudly to meet my destiny,\u0027 said Keli, but there was the barest flicker of uncertainty in her voice. \u0027No you won\u0027t. I mean, I know what I\u0027m talking about. Take it from me. There\u0027s nothing proud about it. You just die.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but it\u0027s how you do it. I shall die nobly, like Queen Ezeriel.\u0027 Mort\u0027s forehead wrinkled. History was a closed book to him. \u0027Who\u0027s she?\u0027 \u0027She lived in Klatch and she had a lot of lovers and she sat on a snake,\u0027 said Cutwell, who was winding up the crossbow. \u0027She meant to! She was crossed in love!\u0027 \u0027All I can remember was that she used to take baths in asses\u0027 milk. Funny thing, history,\u0027 said Cutwell reflectively. \u0027You become a queen, reign for thirty years, make laws, declare war on people and then the only thing you get remembered for is that you smelled like yoghurt and were bitten in the—\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s a distant ancestor of mine,\u0027 snapped Keli. \u0027I won\u0027t listen to this sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027Will you both be quiet and listen to me!\u0027 shouted Mort. Silence descended like a shroud. Then Cutwell sighted carefully and shot Mort in the back. The night shed its early casualties and journeyed onwards. Even the wildest parties had ended, their guests lurching home to their beds, or someone\u0027s bed at any rate. Shorn of these fellow travellers, mere daytime people who had strayed out of their temporal turf, the true survivors of the night got down to the serious commerce of the dark. This wasn\u0027t so very different from Ankh-Morpork\u0027s daytime business, except that the knives were more obvious and people didn\u0027t smile so much. The Shades were silent, save only for the whistled signals of thieves and the velvety hush of dozens of people going about their private business in careful silence. And, in Ham Alley, Cripple Wa\u0027s famous floating crap game was just getting under way. Several dozen cowled figures knelt or squatted around the little circle of packed earth where Wa\u0027s three eight-sided dice bounced and spun their misleading lesson in statistical probability. \u0027Three!\u0027 \u0027Tuphal\u0027s Eyes, by lo!\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s got you there, Hummok! This guy knows how to roll his bones!\u0027 IT\u0027S A KNACK. Hummok M\u0027guk, a small flat-faced man from one of the Hublandish tribes whose skill at dice was famed wherever two men gathered together to fleece a third, picked up the dice and glared at them. He silently cursed Wa, whose own skill at switching dice was equally notorious among the cognoscenti but had, apparently, failed him, wished a painful and untimely death on the shadowy player seated opposite and hurled the dice into the mud. \u0027Twenty-one the hard way!\u0027 Wa scooped up the dice and handed them to the stranger. As he turned to Hummok one eye flickered ever so slightly. Hummok was impressed – he\u0027d barely noticed the blur in Wa\u0027s deceptively gnarled fingers, and he\u0027d been watching for it. It was disconcerting the way the things rattled in the stranger\u0027s hand and then flew out of it in a slow arc that ended with twenty-four little spots pointing at the stars. Some of the more streetwise in the crowd shuffled away from the stranger, because luck like that can be very unlucky in Cripple Wa\u0027s floating crap game. Wa\u0027s hand closed over the dice with a noise like the click of a trigger. \u0027All the eights,\u0027 he breathed. \u0027Such luck is uncanny, mister.\u0027 The rest of the crowd evaporated like dew, leaving only those heavy-set, unsympathetic-looking men who, if Wa had ever paid tax, would have gone down on his return as Essential Plant and Business Equipment. \u0027Maybe it\u0027s not luck,\u0027 he added. \u0027Maybe it\u0027s wizarding?\u0027 I MOST STRONGLY RESENT THAT. \u0027We had a wizard once who tried to get rich,\u0027 said Wa. \u0027Can\u0027t seem to remember what happened to him. Boys?\u0027 \u0027We give him a good talking-to —\u0027 \u0027— and left him in Pork Passage —\u0027 \u0027— and in Honey Lane —\u0027 \u0027— and a couple other places I can\u0027t remember.\u0027 The stranger stood up. The boys closed in around him. THIS IS UNCALLED FOR. I SEEK ONLY TO LEARN. WHAT PLEASURE CAN HUMANS FIND IN A MERE REITERATION OF THE LAWS OF CHANCE? \u0027Chance doesn\u0027t come into it. Let\u0027s have a look at him, boys.\u0027 The events that followed were recalled by no living soul except the one belonging to a feral cat, one of the city\u0027s thousands, that was crossing the alley en route to a tryst. It stopped and watched with interest. The boys froze in mid-stab. Painful purple light flickered around them. The stranger pushed his hood back and picked up the dice, and then pushed them into Wa\u0027s unresisting hand. The man was opening and shutting his mouth, his eyes unsuccessfully trying not to see what was in front of them. Grinning. THROW. Wa managed to look down at his hand. \u0027What are the stakes?\u0027 he whispered. IF YOU WIN, YOU WILL REFRAIN FROM THESE RIDICULOUS ATTEMPTS TO SUGGEST THAT CHANCE GOVERNS THE AFFAIRS OF MEN. \u0027Yes. Yes. And . . . if I lose?\u0027 YOU WILL WISH YOU HAD WON. Wa tried to swallow, but his throat had gone dry. \u0027I know I\u0027ve had lots of people murdered —\u0027 TWENTY-THREE, TO BE PRECISE. \u0027Is it too late to say I\u0027m sorry?\u0027 SUCH THINGS DO NOT CONCERN ME. NOW THROW THE DICE. Wa shut his eyes and dropped the dice on to the ground, too nervous even to try the special flick-and-twist throw. He kept his eyes shut. ALL THE EIGHTS. THERE, THAT WASN\u0027T TOO DIFFICULT, WAS IT? Wa fainted. Death shrugged, and walked away, pausing only to tickle the ears of an alley cat that happened to be passing. He hummed to himself. He didn\u0027t quite know what had come over him, but he was enjoying it. \u0027You couldn\u0027t be sure it would work!\u0027 Cutwell spread his hands in a conciliatory gesture. \u0027Well, no,\u0027 he conceded, \u0027but I thought, what have I got to lose?\u0027 He backed away. \u0027What have you got to lose?\u0027 shouted Mort. He stamped forward and tugged the bolt out of one of the posts in the princess\u0027s bed. \u0027You\u0027re not going to tell me this went through me?\u0027 he snapped. \u0027I was particularly watching it,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027I saw it too,\u0027 said Keli. \u0027It was horrible. It came right out of where your heart is.\u0027 \u0027And I saw you walk through a stone pillar,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027And I saw you ride straight through a window.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but that was on business,\u0027 declared Mort, waving his hands in the air. That wasn\u0027t everyday, that\u0027s different. And —\u0027 He paused. The way you\u0027re looking at me,\u0027 he said. They looked at me the same way in the inn this evening. What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 \u0027It was the way you waved your arm straight through the bedpost,\u0027 said Keli faintly. Mort stared at his hand, and then rapped it on the wood. \u0027See?\u0027 he said. \u0027Solid. Solid arm, solid wood.\u0027 \u0027You said people looked at you in an inn?\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027What did you do, then? Walk through the wall?\u0027 \u0027No! I mean, no, I just drank this drink, I think it was called scrumble —\u0027 \u0027Scumble?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Tastes like rotten apples. You\u0027d have thought it was some sort of poison the way they kept staring.\u0027 \u0027How much did you drink, then?\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027A pint, perhaps, I wasn\u0027t really paying much attention —\u0027 \u0027Did you know scumble is the strongest alcoholic drink between here and the Ramtops?\u0027 the wizard demanded. \u0027No. No-one said,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027What\u0027s it got to do with—\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Cutwell, slowly, \u0027you didn\u0027t know. Hmm. That\u0027s a clue, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Has it got anything to do with saving the princess?\u0027 \u0027Probably not. I\u0027d like to have a look at my books, though.\u0027 \u0027In that case it\u0027s not important,\u0027 said Mort firmly. He turned to Keli, who was looking at him with the faint beginnings of admiration. \u0027I think I can help,\u0027 he said. \u0027I think I can lay my hands on some powerful magic. Magic will hold back the dome, won\u0027t it, Cutwell?\u0027 \u0027My magic won\u0027t. It\u0027d have to be pretty strong stuff, and I\u0027m not sure about it even then. Reality is tougher than —\u0027 \u0027I shall go,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Until tomorrow, farewell!\u0027 \u0027It is tomorrow,\u0027 Keli pointed out. Mort deflated slightly. \u0027All right, tonight then,\u0027 he said, slightly put out, and added, \u0027I will begone!\u0027 \u0027Begone what?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s hero talk,\u0027 said Cutwell, kindly. \u0027He can\u0027t help it.\u0027 Mort scowled at him, smiled bravely at Keli and walked out of the room. \u0027He might have opened the door,\u0027 said Keli, after he had gone. \u0027I think he was a bit embarrassed,\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027We all go through that stage.\u0027 \u0027What, of walking through things?\u0027 \u0027In a manner of speaking. Walking into them, anyway.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m going to get some sleep,\u0027 Keli said. \u0027Even the dead need some rest. Cutwell, stop fiddling with that crossbow, please. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not wizardly to be alone in a lady\u0027s boudoir.\u0027 \u0027Hmm? But I\u0027m not alone, am I? You\u0027re here.\u0027 \u0027That,\u0027 she said, \u0027is the point, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Oh. Yes. Sorry. Um. I\u0027ll see you in the morning, then.\u0027 \u0027Goodnight, Cutwell. Shut the door behind you.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-21.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.
