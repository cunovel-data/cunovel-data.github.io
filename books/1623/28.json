{"id":95343,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"It was thicker than any normal staff, mainly because of the carvings that covered it from top to bottom. They were actually quite indistinct, but gave the impression that if you could see them better you would regret it.\n Albert brushed himself down again and examined himself critically in the washstand mirror.\n Then he said, \u0027Hat. No hat. Got to have a hat for the wizarding. Damn.\u0027\n He stamped out of the room and returned after a busy fifteen minutes which included a circular hole cut out of the carpet in Mort\u0027s bedroom, the silver paper taken out from behind the mirror in Ysabell\u0027s room, a needle and thread from the box under the sink in the kitchen and a few loose sequins scraped up from the bottom of the robe chest. The end result was not as good as he would have liked and tended to slip rakishly over one eye, but it was black and had stars and moons on it and proclaimed its owner to be, without any doubt, a wizard, although possibly a desperate one.\n He felt properly dressed for the first time in two thousand years. It was a disconcerting feeling and caused him a second\u0027s reflection before he kicked aside the rag rug beside the bed and used the staff to draw a circle on the floor.\n When the tip of the staff passed it left a line of glowing octarine, the eighth colour of the spectrum, the colour of magic, the pigment of the imagination.\n He marked eight points on its circumference and joined them up to form an octogram. A low throbbing began to fill the room.\n Alberto Malich stepped into the centre and held the staff above his head. He felt it wake to his grip, felt the tingle of the sleeping power unfold itself slowly and deliberately, like a waking tiger. It triggered old memories of power and magic that buzzed through the cobwebbed attics of his mind. He felt alive for the first time in centuries.\n He licked his lips. The throbbing had died away, leaving a strange, waiting kind of silence.\n Malich raised his head and shouted one single syllable.\n Blue-green fire flashed from both ends of the staff. Streams of octarine flame spouted from the eight pouits of the octogram and enveloped the wizard. All this wasn\u0027t actually necessary to accomplish the spell, but wizards consider appearances are very important. . . .\n So are disappearances. He vanished.\n Stratohemispheric winds whipped at Mort\u0027s cloak.\n \u0027Where are we going first?\u0027 yelled Ysabell in his ear.\n \u0027Bes Pelargic!\u0027 shouted Mort, the gale whirling his words away.\n \u0027Where\u0027s that?\u0027\n \u0027Agatean Empire! Counterweight Continent!\u0027\n He pointed downward.\n He wasn\u0027t forcing Binky at the moment, knowing the miles that lay ahead, and the big white horse was currently running at an easy gallop out over the ocean. Ysabell looked down at roaring green waves topped with white foam, and clung tighter to Mort.\n Mort peered ahead at the cloudbank that marked the distant continent and resisted the urge to hurry Binky along with the flat of his sword. He\u0027d never struck the horse and wasn\u0027t at all confident about what would happen if he did. All he could do was wait.\n A hand appeared under his arm, holding a sandwich.\n \u0027There\u0027s ham or cheese and chutney,\u0027 she said. \u0027You might as well eat, there\u0027s nothing else to do.\u0027\n Mort looked down at the soggy triangle and tried to remember when he last had a meal. Some time beyond the reach of a clock, anyway – he\u0027d need a calendar to calculate it. He took the sandwich.\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 he said, as graciously as he could manage.\n The tiny sun rolled down towards the horizon, towing its lazy daylight behind it. The clouds ahead grew, and became outlined in pink and orange. After a while he could make out the darker blur of land below them, with here and there the lights of a city.\n Half an hour later he was sure he could see individual buildings. Agatean architecture inclined towards squat pyramids.\n Binky lost height until his hooves were barely a few feet above the sea. Mort examined the hourglass again, and gently tugged on the reins to direct the horse towards a seaport a little Rimwards of their present course.\n There were a few ships at anchor, mostly single-sailed coastal traders. The Empire didn\u0027t encourage its subjects to go far away, in case they saw things that might disturb them. For the same reason it had built a wall around the entire country, patrolled by the Heavenly Guard whose main function was to tread heavily on the fingers of any inhabitants who felt they might like to step outside for five minutes for a breath of fresh air.\n This didn\u0027t happen often, because most of the subjects of the Sun Emperor were quite happy to live inside the Wall. It\u0027s a fact of life that everyone is on one side or other of a wall, so the only thing to do is forget about it or evolve stronger fingers.\n \u0027Who runs this place?\u0027 said Ysabell, as they passed over the harbour.\n \u0027There\u0027s some kind of boy emperor,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027But the top man is really the Grand Vizier, I think.\u0027\n \u0027Never trust a Grand Vizier,\u0027 said Ysabell wisely.\n In fact the Sun Emperor didn\u0027t. The Vizier, whose name was Nine Turning Mirrors, had some very clear views about who should run the country, e.g., that it should be him, and now the boy was getting big enough to ask questions like \u0027Don\u0027t you think the wall would look better with a few gates in it?\u0027 and \u0027Yes, but what is it like on the other side?\u0027 he had decided that in the Emperor\u0027s own best interests he should be painfully poisoned and buried in quicklime.\n Binky landed on the raked gravel outside the low, many-roomed palace, severely rearranging the harmony of the universe.[8] Mort slid off his back and helped Ysabell down.\n \u0027Just don\u0027t get in the way, will you?\u0027 he said urgently. \u0027And don\u0027t ask questions either.\u0027\n He ran up some lacquered steps and hurried through the silent rooms, pausing occasionally to take his bearings from the hourglass. At last he sidled down a corridor and peered through an ornate lattice into a long low room where the Court was at its evening meal.\n The young Sun Emperor was sitting crosslegged at the head of the mat with his cloak of vermine and feathers spread out behind him. He looked as though he was outgrowing it. The rest of the Court was sitting around the mat in strict and complicated order of precedence, but there was no mistaking the Vizier, who was tucking into his bowl of squishi and boiled seaweed in a highly suspicious fashion. No-one seemed to be about to die.\n Mort padded along the passage, turned the corner and nearly walked into several large members of the Heavenly Guard, who were clustered around a spyhole in the paper wall and passing a cigarette from hand to hand in that palm-cupped way of soldiers on duty.\n He tiptoed back to the lattice and overheard the conversation thus:\n \u0027I am the most unfortunate of mortals, O Immanent Presence, to find such as this in my otherwise satisfactory squishi,\u0027 said the Vizier, extending his chopsticks.\n The Court craned to see. So did Mort. Mort couldn\u0027t help agreeing with the statement, though – the thing was a sort of blue-green lump with rubbery tubes dangling from it.\n The preparer of food will be disciplined, Noble Personage of Scholarship,\u0027 said the Emperor. \u0027Who got the spare ribs?\u0027\n \u0027No, O Perceptive Father of Your People, I was rather referring to the fact that this is, I believe, the bladder and spleen of the deepwater puff eel, allegedly the most tasty of morsels to the extent that it may be eaten only by those beloved of the gods themselves or so it is written, among such company of course I do not include my miserable self.\u0027\n With a deft flick he transported it to the bowl of the Emperor, where it wobbled to a standstill. The boy looked at it for some time, and then skewered it on a chopstick.\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 he said, \u0027but is it not also written by none other than the great philosopher Ly Tin Wheedle that a scholar may be ranked above princes? I seem to remember you giving me the passage to read once, O Faithful and Assiduous Seeker of Knowledge.\u0027\n The thing followed another brief arc through the air and flopped apologetically into the Vizier\u0027s bowl. He scooped it up in a quick movement and poised it for a second service. His eyes narrowed.\n \u0027Such may be generally the case, O Jade River of Wisdom, but specifically I cannot be ranked above the Emperor whom I love as my own son and have done ever since his late father\u0027s unfortunate death, and thus I lay this small offering at your feet.\u0027\n The eyes of the court followed the wretched organ on its third flight across the mat, but the Emperor snatched up his fan and brought off a magnificent volley that ended back in the Vizier\u0027s bowl with such force that it sent up a spray of seaweed.\n \u0027Somebody eat it, for heaven\u0027s sake,\u0027 shouted Mort, totally unheard. \u0027I\u0027m in a hurry!\u0027\n Thou art indeed the most thoughtful of servants, 0 Devoted and Indeed Only Companion of My Late Father and Grandfather When They Passed Over, and therefore I decree that your reward shall be this most rare and exquisite of morsels.\u0027\n The Vizier prodded the thing uncertainly, and looked into the Emperor\u0027s smile. It was bright and terrible. He fumbled for an excuse.\n \u0027Alas, it would seem that I have already eaten far too much —\u0027 he began, but the Emperor waved him into silence.\n \u0027Doubtless it requires a suitable seasoning,\u0027 he said, and clapped his hands. The wall behind him ripped from top to bottom and four Heavenly Guards stepped through, three of them brandishing cando swords and the fourth trying hurriedly to swallow a lighted dog-end.\n The Vizier\u0027s bowl dropped from his hands.\n \u0027My most faithful of servants believes he has no space left for this final mouthful,\u0027 said the Emperor. \u0027Doubtless you can investigate his stomach to see if this is true. Why has that man got smoke coming out of his ears?\u0027\n \u0027Anxious for action, O Sky Eminence,\u0027 said the sergeant quickly. \u0027No stopping him, I\u0027m afraid.\u0027\n Then let him take his knife and – oh, the Vizier seems to be hungry after all. Well done.\u0027\n There was absolute silence while the Vizier\u0027s cheeks bulged rhythmically. Then he gulped.\n \u0027Delicious,\u0027 he said. \u0027Superb. Truly the food of the gods, and now, if you will excuse me —\u0027 He unfolded his legs and made as if to stand up. Little beads of sweat had appeared on his forehead.\n \u0027You wish to depart?\u0027 said the Emperor, raising his eyebrows.\n \u0027Pressing matters of state, O Perspicacious Personage of —\u0027\n \u0027Be seated. Rising so soon after meals can be bad for the digestion,\u0027 said the Emperor, and the guards nodded agreement. \u0027Besides, there are no urgent matters of state unless you refer to those in the small red bottle marked “Antidote” in the black lacquered cabinet on the bamboo rug in your quarters, O Lamp of Midnight Oil.\u0027\n There was a ringing in the Vizier\u0027s ears. His face began to go blue.\n \u0027You see?\u0027 said the Emperor. \u0027Untimely activity on a heavy stomach is conducive to ill humours. May this message go swiftly to all corners of my country, that all men may know of your unfortunate condition and derive instruction thereby.\u0027\n \u0027I . . . must . . . congratulate your . . . Personage on such . . . consideration,\u0027 said the Vizier, and fell forward into a dish of boiled soft-shelled crabs.\n \u0027I had an excellent teacher,\u0027 said the Emperor.\n ABOUT TIME, TOO, said Mort, and swung the sword.\n A moment later the soul of the Vizier got up from the mat and looked Mort up and down.\n \u0027Who are you, barbarian?\u0027 he snapped.\n DEATH.\n \u0027Not my Death,\u0027said the Vizier firmly. \u0027Where\u0027s the Black Celestial Dragon of Fire?\u0027\n HE COULDN\u0027T COME, said Mort. There were shadows forming in the air behind the Vizier\u0027s soul. Several of them wore emperor\u0027s robes, but there were plenty of others jostling them, and they all looked most anxious to welcome the newcomer to the lands of the dead. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-28.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Mort (Discworld #4) \n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
