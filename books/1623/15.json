{"id":95330,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u0027I thought so.\u0027\n Cutwell patted her ineptly on the hand, and Keli was too preoccupied even to notice such flagrant lesè majesté.\n \u0027You see, everything\u0027s fixed. History is all worked out, from start to finish. What the facts actually are is beside the point; history just rolls straight over the top of them. You can\u0027t change anything because the changes are already part of it. You\u0027re dead. It\u0027s fated. You\u0027ll just have to accept it.\u0027\n He gave an apologetic grin. \u0027You\u0027re a lot luckier than most dead people, if you look at it objectively,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027re alive to enjoy it.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to accept it. Why should I accept it? It\u0027s not my fault!\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t understand. History is moving on. You can\u0027t get involved in it any more. There isn\u0027t a part in it for you, don\u0027t you see? Best to let things take their course.\u0027 He patted her hand again. She looked at him. He withdrew his hand.\n \u0027What am I supposed to do then?\u0027 she said. \u0027Not eat, because the food wasn\u0027t destined to be eaten by me? Go and live in a crypt somewhere?\u0027\n \u0027Bit of a poser, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 agreed Cutwell. \u0027That\u0027s fate for you, I\u0027m afraid. If the world can\u0027t sense you, you don\u0027t exist. I\u0027m a wizard. We know —\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t say it.\u0027\n Keli stood up.\n Five generations ago one of her ancestor had halted his band of nomadic cutthroats a few miles from the mound of Sto Lat and had regarded the sleeping city with a peculiarly determined expression that said: This\u0027ll do. Just because you\u0027re born in the saddle doesn\u0027t mean you have to die in the bloody thing.\n Strangely enough, many of his distinctive features had, by a trick of heredity, been bequeathed to his descendant[3], accounting for her rather idiosyncratic attractiveness. They were never more apparent than now. Even Cutwell was impressed. When it came to determination, you could have cracked rocks on her jaw.\n In exactly the same tone of voice that her ancestor had used when he addressed his weary, sweaty followers before the attack[4], she said:\n \u0027No. No, I\u0027m not going to accept it. I\u0027m not going to dwindle into some sort of ghost. You\u0027re going to help me, wizard.\u0027\n Cutwell\u0027s subconscious recognised that tone. It had harmonics in it that made even the woodworm in the floorboards stop what they were doing and stand to attention. It wasn\u0027t voicing an opinion, it was saying: things will be thus.\n \u0027Me, madam?\u0027 he quavered, \u0027I don\u0027t see what I can possibly—\u0027\n He was jerked off his chair and out into the street, his robes billowing around him. Keli marched towards the palace with her shoulders set determinedly, dragging the wizard behind her like a reluctant puppy. It was with such a walk that mothers used to bear down on the local school when their little boy came home with a black eye; it was unstoppable; it was like the March of Time.\n \u0027What is it you intend?\u0027 Cutwell stuttered, horribly aware that there was going to be nothing he could do to resist, whatever it was.\n \u0027It\u0027s your lucky day, wizard.\u0027\n \u0027Oh. Good,\u0027 he said weakly.\n \u0027You\u0027ve just been appointed Royal Recogniser.\u0027\n \u0027Oh. What does that entail, exactly?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re going to remind everyone I\u0027m alive. It\u0027s very simple. There\u0027s three square meals a day and your laundry done. Step lively, man.\u0027\n \u0027Royal?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re a wizard. I think there\u0027s something you ought to know,\u0027 said the princess.\n THERE is? said Death.\n (That was a cinematic trick adapted for print. Death wasn\u0027t talking to the princess. He was actually in his study, talking to Mort. But it was quite effective, wasn\u0027t it? It\u0027s probably called a fast dissolve, or a crosscut/zoom. Or something. An industry where a senior technician is called a Best Boy might call it anything.)\n AND WHAT IS THAT? he added, winding a bit of black silk around the wicked hook in a little vice he\u0027d clamped to his desk.\n Mort hesitated. Mostly this was because of fear and embarrassment, but it was also because the sight of a hooded spectre peacefully tying dry flies was enough to make anyone pause.\n Besides, Ysabell was sitting on the other side of the room, ostensibly doing some needlework but also watching him through a cloud of sullen disapproval. He could feel her red-rimmed eyes boring into the back of his neck.\n Death inserted a few crow hackles and whistled a busy little tune through his teeth, not having anything else to whistle through. He looked up.\n HMM?\n They – didn\u0027t go as smoothly as I thought,\u0027 said Mort, standing nervously on the carpet in front of the desk.\n You HAD TROUBLE? said Death, snipping off a few scraps of feather.\n \u0027Well, you see, the witch wouldn\u0027t come away, and the monk, well, he started out all over again.\u0027\n THERE\u0027S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THERE, LAD —\n \u0027— Mort —\u0027\n — YOU SHOULD HAVE WORKED OUT BY NOW THAT EVERYONE GETS WHAT THEY THINK IS COMING TO THEM. IT\u0027S SO MUCH NEATER THAT WAY.\n \u0027I know, sir. But that means bad people who think they\u0027re going to some sort of paradise actually do get there. And good people who fear they\u0027re going to some kind of horrible place really suffer. It doesn\u0027t seem like justice.\u0027\n WHAT is IT I\u0027VE SAID YOU MUST REMEMBER, WHEN YOU\u0027RE OUT ON THE DUTY?\n \u0027Well, you —\u0027\n HMM?\n Mort stuttered into silence.\n THERE\u0027S NO JUSTICE. THERE\u0027S JUST YOU.\n \u0027Well, I —\u0027\n YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT.\n \u0027Yes, but —\u0027\n I EXPECT IT ALL WORKS OUT PROPERLY IN THE END. I HAVE NEVER MET THE CREATOR, BUT I\u0027M TOLD HE\u0027S QUITE KINDLY DISPOSED TO PEOPLE. Death snapped the thread and started to unwind the vice.\n PUT SUCH THOUGHTS OUT OF YOUR MIND, he added. AT LEAST THE THIRD ONE SHOULDN\u0027T HAVE GIVEN YOU ANY TROUBLE.\n This was the moment. Mort had thought about it for a long tune. There was no sense in concealing it. He\u0027d upset the whole future course of history. Such things tend to draw themselves to people\u0027s attention. Best to get it off his chest. Own up like a man. Take his medicine. Cards on table. Beating about bush, none of. Mercy, throw himself on.\n The piercing blue eyes glittered at him.\n He looked back like a nocturnal rabbit trying to outstare the headlights of a sixteen-wheeled artic whose driver is a twelve-hour caffeine freak outrunning the tachometers of hell.\n He failed.\n \u0027No, sir,\u0027he said.\n GOOD. WELL DONE. Now THEN, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?\n Anglers reckon that a good dry fly should cunningly mimic the real thing. There are the right flies for morning. There are different flies for the evening rise. And so on.\n But the thing between Death\u0027s triumphant digits was a fly from the dawn of time. It was the fly in the primordial soup. It had bred on mammoth turds. It wasn\u0027t a fly that bangs on window panes, it was a fly that drills through walls. It was an insect that would crawl out from between the slats of the heaviest swat dripping venom and seeking revenge. Strange wings and dangling bits stuck out all over it. It seemed to have a lot of teeth.\n \u0027What\u0027s it called?\u0027 said Mort.\n I SHALL CALL IT – DEATH\u0027S GLORY. Death gave the thing a final admiring glance and stuck it into the hood of his robe. I FEEL INCLINED TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF LIFE THIS EVENING, he Said. YOU CAN TAKE THE DUTY, NOWTHATYOU\u0027VEGOTTHEHANGOFIT.AS IT WERE.\n \u0027Yes. Sir,\u0027 said Mort, mournfully. He saw his life stretching out in front of him like a nasty black tunnel with no light at the end of it.\n Death drummed his finger on the desk, muttered to himself.\n AH YES, he said. ALBERT TELLS ME SOMEONE\u0027S BEEN MEDDLING IN THE LIBRARY.\n \u0027Pardon, sir?\u0027\n TAKING BOOKS our, LEAVING THEM LYING AROUND.\n BOOKS ABOUT YOUNG WOMEN. HE SEEMS TO THINK IT IS AMUSING.\n As has already been revealed, the Holy Listeners have such well developed hearing that they can be deafened by a good sunset. Just for a few seconds it seemed to Mort that the skin on the back of his neck was developing similar strange powers, because he could see Ysabell freeze in mid-stitch. He also heard the little intake of breath that he\u0027d heard before, among the shelves. He remembered the lace handkerchief.\n He said, \u0027Yes, sir. It won\u0027t happen again, sir.\u0027\n The skin on the back of his neck started to itch like fury.\n SPLENDID. Now, YOU TWO CAN RUN ALONG. GET ALBERT TO DO YOU A PICNIC LUNCH OR SOMETHING. GET SOME FRESH AIR. I\u0027VE NOTICED THE WAY YOU TWO ALWAYS AVOID EACH OTHER. He gave Mort a conspiratorial nudge – it was like being poked with a stick – and added, ALBERT\u0027S TOLD ME WHAT THAT MEANS.\n \u0027Has he?\u0027 said Mort gloomily. He\u0027d been wrong, there was a light at the end of the tunnel, and it was a flamethrower.\n Death gave him another of his supernova winks.\n Mort didn\u0027t return it. Instead he turned and plodded towards the door, at a general speed and gait that made Great A\u0027Tuin look like a spring lamb.\n He was halfway along the corridor before he heard the soft rush of footsteps behind him and a hand caught his arm.\n \u0027Mort?\u0027\n He turned and gazed at Ysabell through a fog of depression.\n \u0027Why did you let him think it was you in the library?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t know.\u0027\n \u0027It was . . . very . . . kind of you,\u0027 she said cautiously.\n \u0027Was it? I can\u0027t think what came over me.\u0027 He felt in his pocket and produced the handkerchief. This belongs to you, I think.\u0027\n \u0027Thank you.\u0027 She blew her nose noisily.\n Mort was already well down the corridor, his shoulders hunched like vulture\u0027s wings. She ran after him.\n \u0027I say,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027I wanted to say thank you.\u0027\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027It\u0027d just be best if you don\u0027t take books away again. It upsets them, or something.\u0027 He gave what he considered to be a mirthless laugh. \u0027Ha!\u0027\n \u0027Ha what?\u0027\n \u0027Just ha!\u0027\n He\u0027d reached the end of the corridor. There was the door into the kitchen, where Albert would be leering knowingly, and Mort decided he couldn\u0027t face that. He stopped.\n \u0027But I only took the books for a bit of company,\u0027 she said behind him.\n He gave in.\n \u0027We could have a walk in the garden,\u0027 he said in despair, and then managed to harden his heart a little and added, \u0027Without obligation, that is.\u0027\n \u0027You mean you\u0027re not going to marry me?\u0027 she said. Mort was horrified. \u0027Marry?\u0027\n \u0027Isn\u0027t that what father brought you here for?\u0027 she said. \u0027He doesn\u0027t need an apprentice, after all.\u0027\n \u0027You mean all those nudges and winks and little comments about some day my son all this will be yours?\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I tried to ignore them. I don\u0027t want to get married to anyone yet,\u0027 he added, suppressing a fleeting mental picture of the princess. \u0027And certainly not to you, no offence meant.\u0027\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t marry you if you were the last man on the Disc,\u0027 she said sweetly.\n Mort was hurt by this. It was one thing not to want to marry someone, but quite another to be told they didn\u0027t want to marry you.\n \u0027At least I don\u0027t look like I\u0027ve been eating doughnuts in a wardrobe for years,\u0027 he said, as they stepped out on to Death\u0027s black lawn.\n \u0027At least I walk as if my legs only had one knee each,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027My eyes aren\u0027t two juugly poached eggs.\u0027\n Ysabell nodded. \u0027On the other hand, my ears don\u0027t look like something growing on a dead tree. What does juugly mean?\u0027\n \u0027You know, eggs like Albert does them.\u0027\n \u0027With the white all sticky and runny and full of slimy bits?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027A good word,\u0027 she conceded thoughtfully. \u0027But my hair, I put it to you, doesn\u0027t look like something you clean a privy with.\u0027\n \u0027Certainly, but neither does mine look like a wet hedgehog.\u0027\n \u0027Pray note that my chest does not appear to be a toast rack in a wet paper bag.\u0027\n Mort glanced sideways at the top of Ysabell\u0027s dress, which contained enough puppy fat for two litters of Rotweilers, and forbore to comment.\n \u0027My eyebrows don\u0027t look like a pair of mating caterpillars,\u0027 he hazarded. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-15.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Mort (Discworld #4) \n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
