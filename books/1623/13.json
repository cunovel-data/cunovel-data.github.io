I\u0027ve never seen him like this.\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 Mort took the plunge. \u0027Albert, have you been here long?\u0027 Albert looked at him over the top of his spectacles. \u0027Maybe,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s hard to keep track of outside time, boy. I bin here since just after the old king died.\u0027 \u0027Which king, Albert?\u0027 \u0027Artorollo, I think he was called. Little fat man. Squeaky voice. I only saw him the once, though.\u0027 \u0027Where was this?\u0027 \u0027In Ankh, of course.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 said Mort. They don\u0027t have kings in Ankh-Morpork, everyone knows that!\u0027 \u0027This was back a bit, I said,\u0027 said Albert. He poured himself a cup of tea from Death\u0027s personal teapot and sat down, a dreamy look in his crusted eyes. Mort waited expectantly. \u0027And they was kings in those days, real kings, not like the sort you get now. They was monarchs,\u0027 continued Albert, carefully pouring some tea into his saucer and fanning it primly with the end of his muffler. \u0027I mean, they was wise and fair, well, fairly wise. And they wouldn\u0027t think twice about cutting your head off soon as look at you,\u0027 he added approvingly. \u0027And all the queens were tall and pale and wore them balaclava helmet things —\u0027 \u0027Wimples?\u0027 said Mort. \u0027Yeah, them, and the princesses were beautiful as the day is long and so noble they, they could pee through a dozen mattresses —\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 Albert hesitated. \u0027Something like that, anyway,\u0027 he conceded. \u0027And there was balls and tournaments and executions. Great days.\u0027 He smiled dreamily at his memories. \u0027Not like the sort of days you get now,\u0027 he said, emerging from his reverie with bad grace. \u0027Have you got any other names, Albert?\u0027 said Mort. But the brief spell had been broken and the old man wasn\u0027t going to be drawn. \u0027Oh, I know,\u0027 he snapped, \u0027get Albert\u0027s name and you\u0027ll go and look him up in the library, won\u0027t you? Prying and poking. I know you, skulking in there at all hours reading the lives of young wimmen —\u0027 The heralds of guilt must have flourished their tarnished trumpets in the depths of Mort\u0027s eyes, because Albert cackled and prodded him with a bony finger. \u0027You might at least put them back where you find \u0027em,\u0027 he said, \u0027not leave piles of \u0027em around for old Albert to put back. Anyway, it\u0027s not right, ogling the poor dead things. It probably turns you blind.\u0027 \u0027But I only —\u0027 Mort began, and remembered the damp lace handkerchief in his pocket, and shut up. He left Albert grumbling to himself and doing the washing up, and slipped into the library. Pale sunlight lanced down from the high windows, gently fading the covers on the patient, ancient volumes. Occasionally a speck of dust would catch the light as it floated through the golden shafts, and flare like a miniature supernova. Mort knew that if he listened hard enough he could hear the insect-like scritching of the books as they wrote themselves. Once upon a time Mort would have found it eerie. Now it was – reassuring. It demonstrated that the universe was running smoothly. His conscience, which had been looking for the opening, gleefully reminded him that, all right, it might be running smoothly but it certainly wasn\u0027t heading in the right direction. He made his way through the maze of shelves to the mysterious pile of books, and found it was gone. Albert had been in the kitchen, and Mort had never seen Death himself enter the library. What was Ysabell looking for, then? He glanced up at the cliff of shelves above him, and his stomach went cold when he thought of what was starting to happen. . . . There was nothing for it. He\u0027d have to tell someone. Keli, meanwhile, was also finding life difficult. This was because causality had an incredible amount of inertia. Mort\u0027s misplaced thrust, driven by anger and desperation and nascent love, had sent it down a new track but it hadn\u0027t noticed yet. He\u0027d kicked the tail of the dinosaur, but it would be some time before the other end realised it was time to say \u0027ouch\u0027. Bluntly, the universe knew Keli was dead and was therefore rather surprised to find that she hadn\u0027t stopped walking and breathing yet. It showed it in little ways. The courtiers who gave her furtive odd looks during the morning would not have been able to say why the sight of her made them feel strangely uncomfortable. To their acute embarrassment and her annoyance they found themselves ignoring her, or talking in hushed voices. The Chamberlain found he\u0027d instructed that the royal standard be flown at half mast and for the life of him couldn\u0027t explain why. He was gently led off to his bed with a mild nervous affliction after ordering a thousand yards of black bunting for no apparent reason. The eerie, unreal feeling soon spread throughout the castle. The head coachman ordered the state bier to be brought out again and polished, and then stood in the stable yard and wept into his chamois leather because he couldn\u0027t remember why. Servants walked softly along the corridors. The cook had to fight an overpowering urge to prepare simple banquets of cold meat. Dogs howled and then stopped, feeling rather stupid. The two black stallions who traditionally pulled the Sto Lat funeral cortege grew restive in their stalls and nearly kicked a groom to death. In his castle in Sto Helit, the duke waited in vain for a messenger who had in fact set out, but had stopped halfway down the street, unable to remember what it was he was supposed to be doing. Through all this Keli moved like a solid and increasingly more irritated ghost. Things came to a head at lunchtime. She swept into the great hall and found no place had been set in front of the royal chair. By speaking loudly and distinctly to the butler she managed to get that rectified, then saw dishes being passed in front of her before she could get a fork into them. She watched in sullen disbelief as the wine was brought in and poured first for the Lord of the Privy Closet. It was an unregal thing to do, but she stuck out a foot and tripped the wine waiter. He stumbled, muttered something under his breath, and stared down at the flagstones. She leaned the other way and shouted into the ear of the Yeoman of the Pantry: \u0027Can you see me, man? Why are we reduced to eating cold pork and ham?\u0027 He turned aside from his hushed conversation with the Lady of the Small Hexagonal Room in the North Turret, gave her a long look in which shock made way for a sort of unfocused puzzlement, and said, \u0027Why, yes . . . I can . . . er. . . .\u0027 \u0027Your Royal Highness,\u0027 prompted Keli. \u0027But . . . yes . . . Highness,\u0027 he muttered. There was a heavy pause. Then, as if switched back on, he turned his back on her and resumed his conversation. Keli sat for a while, white with shock and anger, then pushed the chair back and stormed away to her chambers. A couple of servants sharing a quick rollup in the passage outside were knocked sideways by something they couldn\u0027t quite see. Keli ran into her room and hauled on the rope that should have sent the duty maid running in from the sitting room at the end of the corridor. Nothing happened for some time, and then the door was pushed open slowly and a face peered in at her. She recognised the look this time, and was ready for it. She grabbed the maid by the shoulders and hauled her bodily into the room, slamming the door shut behind her. As the frightened woman stared everywhere but at Keli she hauled off and fetched her a stinging slap across the cheek. \u0027Did you feel that? Did you feel it?\u0027 she shrieked. \u0027But . . . you . . .\u0027 the maid whimpered, staggering backwards until she hit the bed and sitting down heavily on it. \u0027Look at me! Look at me when I talk to you!\u0027 yelled Keli, advancing on her. \u0027You can see me, can\u0027t you? Tell me you can see me or I\u0027ll have you executed!\u0027 The maid stared into her terrified eyes. \u0027I can see you,\u0027 she said, \u0027but. . . .\u0027 \u0027But what? But what?\u0027 \u0027Surely you\u0027re . . . I heard . . . I thought. . . .\u0027 \u0027What did you think?\u0027 snapped Keli. She wasn\u0027t shouting any more. Her words came out like white-hot whips. The maid collapsed into a sobbing heap. Keli stood tapping her foot for a moment, and then shook the woman gently. \u0027Is there a wizard in the city?\u0027 she said. \u0027Look at me, at me. There\u0027s a wizard, isn\u0027t there? You girls are always skulking off to talk to wizards! Where does he live?\u0027 The woman turned a tear-stained face towards her, fighting against every instinct that told her the princess didn\u0027t exist. \u0027Uh . . . wizard, yes . . . Cutwell, in Wall Street. Keli\u0027s lips compressed into a thin smile. She wondered where her cloaks were kept, but cold reason told her it was going to be a damn sight easier to find them herself than try to make her presence felt to the maid. She waited, watching closely, as the woman stopped sobbing, looked around her in vague bewilderment, and hurried out of the room. She\u0027s forgotten me already, she thought. She looked at her hands. She seemed solid enough. It had to be magic. She wandered into her robing room and experimentally opened a few cupboards until she found a black cloak and hood. She slipped them on and darted out into the corridor and down the servants\u0027 stairs. She hadn\u0027t been this way since she was little. This was the world of linen cupboards, bare floors and dumb-waiters. It smelled of slightly stale crusts. Keli moved through it like an earthbound spook. She was aware of the servants\u0027 quarters, of course, in the same way that people are aware at some level in their minds of the drains or the guttering, and she would be quite prepared to concede that although servants all looked pretty much alike they must have some distinguishing features by which their nearest and dearest could, presumably, identify them. But she was not prepared for sights like Moghedron the wine butler, whom she had hitherto seen only as a stately presence moving like a galleon under full sail, sitting in his pantry with his jacket undone and smoking a pipe. A couple of maids ran past her without a second glance, giggling. She hurried on, aware that in some strange way she was trespassing in her own castle. And that, she realised, was because it wasn\u0027t her castle at all. The noisy world around her, with its steaming laundries and chilly stillrooms, was its own world. She couldn\u0027t own it. Possibly it owned her. She took a chicken leg from the table in the biggest kitchen, a cavern lined with so many pots that by the light of its fires it looked like an armoury for tortoises, and felt the unfamiliar thrill of theft. Theft! In her own kingdom! And the cook looked straight through her, eyes as glazed as jugged ham. Keli ran across the stable yards and out of the back gate, past a couple of sentries whose stern gaze quite failed to notice her. Out in the streets it wasn\u0027t so creepy, but she still felt oddly naked. It was unnerving, being among people who were going about their own affairs and not bothering to look at one, when one\u0027s entire experience of the world hitherto was that it revolved around one. Pedestrians bumped into one and rebounded away, wondering briefly what it was they had hit, and one several times had to scurry away out of the path of wagons. The chicken leg hadn\u0027t gone far to fill the hole left by the absence of lunch, and she filched a couple of apples from a stall, making a mental note to have the chamberlain find out how much apples cost and send some money down to the stallholder. Dishevelled, rather grubby and smelling slightly of horse dung, she came at last to Cutwell\u0027s door. The knocker gave her some trouble. In her experience doors opened for you; there were special people to arrange it. She was so distraught she didn\u0027t even notice that the knocker winked at her. She tried again, and thought she heard a distant crash. After some time the door opened a few inches and she caught a glimpse of a round flustered face topped with curly hair. Her right foot surprised her by intelligently inserting itself in the crack.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-13.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.
