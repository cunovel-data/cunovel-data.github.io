{"id":95348,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"\u0027What had you in mind?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re now a priest. Name your own god.\u0027 Cutwell curtsied, and took the crown from Ysabell. \u0027You\u0027re all making fun of me!\u0027 snapped Keli. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 said Mort, wearily. \u0027It\u0027s been rather a long day.\u0027 \u0027I hope I can do this right,\u0027 said Cutwell solemnly. \u0027I\u0027ve never crowned anyone before.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve never been crowned before!\u0027 \u0027Good,\u0027 said Cutwell soothingly. \u0027We can learn together.\u0027 He started to mutter some impressive words in a strange tongue. It was in fact a simple spell for ridding the clothing of fleas, but he thought, what the hell. And then he thought, gosh, in this reality I\u0027m the most powerful wizard there ever was, that\u0027d be something to tell my grandch . . . He gritted his teeth. There\u0027d be some rules changed in this reality, that was for sure. Ysabell sat down beside Mort and slipped her hand in his. \u0027Well?\u0027 she said quietly. This is the time. Has anything suggested itself?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 The interface was more than halfway down the hall, slowing slightly as it relentlessly ground down the pressure of the intruding reality. Something wet and warm blew in Mort\u0027s ear. He reached up and touched Binky\u0027s muzzle. \u0027Dear old horse,\u0027 he said. \u0027And I\u0027m right out of sugar lumps. You\u0027ll have to find your way home by yourself —\u0027 His hand stopped in mid-pat. \u0027We can all go home,\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t think father would like that very much,\u0027 said Ysabell, but Mort ignored her. \u0027Cutwell!\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re leaving. Are you coming? You\u0027ll still exist when the interface closes.\u0027 \u0027Part of me will,\u0027 said the wizard. \u0027That\u0027s what I meant,\u0027 said Mort, swinging himself up on to Binky\u0027s back. \u0027But speaking as the part that won\u0027t, I\u0027d like to join you,\u0027 said Cutwell quickly. \u0027I intend to stay here to die in my own kingdom,\u0027 said Keli. \u0027What you intend doesn\u0027t signify,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I\u0027ve come all the way across the Disc to rescue you, d\u0027you see, and you\u0027re going to be rescued.\u0027 \u0027But I\u0027m the queen!\u0027 said Keli. Uncertainty welled up in her eyes, and she spun round to Cutwell, who lowered his candle-stick guiltily. \u0027I heard you say the words! I am queen, aren\u0027t I?\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said Cutwell instantly; and then, because a wizard\u0027s word is supposed to be harder than cast iron, added virtuously, \u0027And totally free from infestation, too.\u0027 \u0027Cutwell!\u0027 snapped Mort. The wizard nodded, caught Keli around the waist and bodily hoisted her on to Binky\u0027s back. Hoisting his skirts around his waist he clambered up behind Mort and reached down and swung Ysabell up behind him. The horse jigged across the floor, complaining about the overloading, but Mort turned him towards the broken doorway and urged him forward. The interface followed them as they clattered down the hall and into the courtyard, rising slowly. Its pearly fog was only yards away, tightening by inches. \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Cutwell to Ysabell, raising his hat. \u0027Igneous Cutwell, Wizard Ist Grade (UU), former Royal Recogniser and soon to be beheaded probably. Would you happen to know where we are going?\u0027 To my father\u0027s country,\u0027 shouted Ysabell, above the wind of their passage. \u0027Have I ever met him?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think so. You\u0027d have remembered.\u0027 The top of the palace wall scraped Binky\u0027s hooves as, muscles straining, he sought for more height. Cutwell leaned backward again, holding on to his hat. \u0027Who is this gentleman of which we speak?\u0027 he yelled. \u0027Death,\u0027 said Ysabell. \u0027Not —\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 Cutwell peered down at the distant rooftops, and gave her a lopsided smile. \u0027Would it save time if I just jumped off now?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s quite nice if you get to know him,\u0027 said Ysabell defensively. \u0027Is he? Do you think we\u0027ll get the chance?\u0027 \u0027Hold on!\u0027 said Mort. \u0027We should be going across just about —\u0027 A hole full of blackness rushed out of the sky and caught them. The interface bobbed uncertainly, empty as a pauper\u0027s pocket, and carried on shrinking. The front door opened. Ysabell poked her head out. \u0027There\u0027s no-one at home,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027d better come in.\u0027 The other three filed into the hallway. Cutwell conscientiously wiped his feet. \u0027It\u0027s a bit small,\u0027 said Keli, critically. \u0027It\u0027s a lot bigger inside,\u0027 said Mort, and turned to Ysabell. \u0027Have you looked everywhere?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t even find Albert,\u0027 she said. \u0027I can\u0027t remember him ever not being here.\u0027 She coughed, remembering her duties as hostess. \u0027Would anyone like a drink?\u0027 she said. Keli ignored her. \u0027I was expecting a castle at least,\u0027 she said. \u0027Big and black, with great dark towers. Not an umbrella stand.\u0027 \u0027It has got a scythe in it,\u0027 Cutwell pointed out. \u0027Let\u0027s all go into the study and sit down and I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll all feel better,\u0027 said Ysabell hurriedly, and pushed open the black baize door. Cutwell and Keli stepped through, bickering. Ysabell took Mort\u0027s arm. \u0027What are we going to do now?\u0027 she said. \u0027Father will be very angry if he finds them here.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll think of something,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I\u0027ll rewrite the autobiographies or something.\u0027 He smiled weakly. \u0027Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll think of something.\u0027 The door slammed behind him. Mort turned to look into Albert\u0027s grinning face. The big leather armchair behind the desk revolved slowly. Death looked at Mort over steepled fingers. When he was quite certain he had their full, horrified attention, he said: YOU HAD BETTER START NOW. He stood up, appearing to grow larger as the room darkened. DON\u0027T BOTHER TO APOLOGISE, he added. Keli buried her head in Cutwell\u0027s ample chest. I AM BACK. AND I AM ANGRY. \u0027Master, I —\u0027 Mort began. SHUT UP, said Death. He beckoned Keli with a calcareous forefinger. She turned to look at him, her body not daring to disobey. Death reached out and touched her chin. Mort\u0027s hand went to his sword. IS THIS THE FACE THAT LAUNCHED A THOUSAND SHIPS, AND BURNED THE TOPLESS TOWERS OF PSEUDO— POLIS? wondered Death. Keli stared hypnotised at the red pinpoints miles deep in those dark sockets. \u0027Er, excuse me,\u0027 said Cutwell, holding his hat respectfully, Mexican fashion. WELL? said Death, distracted. \u0027It isn\u0027t, sir. You must be thinking about another face.\u0027 WHAT is YOUR NAME? \u0027Cutwell, sir. I\u0027m a wizard, sir.\u0027 I\u0027M A WIZARD, SIR, Death sneered. BE SILENT, WIZARD. \u0027Sir.\u0027 Cutwell stepped back. Death turned to Ysabell. DAUGHTER, EXPLAIN YOURSELF. WHY DID YOU AID THIS FOOL? Ysabell curtsied nervously. \u0027I – love him, father. I think.\u0027 \u0027You do?\u0027 said Mort, astonished. \u0027You never said!\u0027 There didn\u0027t seem to be time,\u0027 said Ysabell. \u0027Father, he didn\u0027t mean —\u0027 BE SILENT. Ysabell dropped her gaze. \u0027Yes, father.\u0027 Death stalked around the desk until he was standing directly in front of Mort. He stared at him for a long time. Then in one blurred movement his hand struck Mort across the face, knocking him off his feet. I INVITE YOU INTO MY HOME, he said, I TRAIN YOU, I FEED YOU, I CLOTHE YOU, I GIVE YOU OPPORTUNITIES YOU COULD NOT DREAM OF, AND THUS YOU REPAY ME. YOU SEDUCE MY DAUGHTER FROM ME, YOU NEGLECT THE DUTY, YOU MAKE RIPPLES IN REALITY THAT WILL TAKE A CENTURY TO HEAL. YOUR ILL-TIMED ACTIONS HAVE DOOMED YOUR COMRADES TO OBLIVION. THE GODS WILL DEMAND NOTHING LESS. ALL IN ALL, BOY, NOT A GOOD START TO YOUR FIRST JOB. Mort struggled into a sitting position, holding his cheek. It burned coldly, like comet ice. \u0027Mort,\u0027 he said. IT SPEAKS! WHAT DOES IT SAY? \u0027You could let them go,\u0027 said Mort. They just got involved. It wasn\u0027t their fault. You could rearrange this so —\u0027 WHY SHOULD I DO THAT? THEY BELONG TO ME NOW. \u0027I\u0027ll fight you for them,\u0027 said Mort. VERY NOBLE. MORTALS FIGHT ME ALL THE TIME. YOU ARE DISMISSED. Mort got to his feet. He remembered what being Death had been like. He caught hold of the feeling, let it surface. . . . NO, he said. AH. YOU CHALLENGE ME AS BETWEEN EQUALS, THEN? Mort swallowed. But at least the way was clear now. When you step off a cliff, your life takes a very definite direction. \u0027If necessary,\u0027 he said. \u0027And if I win —\u0027 IF YOU WIN, YOU WILL BE IN A POSITION TO DO WHATEVER YOU PLEASE, said Death. FOLLOW ME. He stalked past Mort and out into the hall. The other four looked at Mort. \u0027Are you sure you know what you\u0027re doing?\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t beat the master,\u0027 said Albert. He sighed. Take it from me.\u0027 \u0027What will happen if you lose?\u0027 said Keli. \u0027I won\u0027t lose,\u0027 said Mort. That\u0027s the trouble.\u0027 \u0027Father wants him to win,\u0027 said Ysabell bitterly. \u0027You mean he\u0027ll let Mort win?\u0027 said Cutwell. \u0027Oh, no, he won\u0027t let him win. He just wants him to win.\u0027 Mort nodded. As they followed Death\u0027s dark shape he reflected on an endless future, serving whatever mysterious purpose the Creator had in mind, living outside Time. He couldn\u0027t blame Death for wanting to quit the job. Death had said the bones were not compulsory, but perhaps that wouldn\u0027t matter. Would eternity feel like a long time, or were all lives – from a personal viewpoint – entirely the same length? Hi, said a voice in his head. Remember me? I\u0027m you. I got you into this. \u0027Thanks,\u0027 he said bitterly. The others glanced at him. You could come through this, the voice said. You\u0027ve got a big advantage. You\u0027ve been him, and he\u0027s never been you. Death swept through the hall and into the Long Room, the candles obediently flicking into flame as he entered. ALBERT. \u0027Master?\u0027 FETCH THE GLASSES. \u0027Master.\u0027 Cutwell grabbed the old man\u0027s arm. \u0027You\u0027re a wizard,\u0027 he hissed. \u0027You don\u0027t have to do what he says!\u0027 \u0027How old are you, lad?\u0027 said Albert, kindly. \u0027Twenty.\u0027 \u0027When you\u0027re my age you\u0027ll see your choices differently.\u0027 He turned to Mort. \u0027Sorry.\u0027 Mort drew his sword, its blade almost invisible in the light from the candles. Death turned and stood facing him, a thin silhouette against a towering rack of hourglasses. He held out his arms. The scythe appeared in them with a tiny thunderclap. Albert came back down one of the glass-lined alleys with two hourglasses, and set them down wordlessly on a ledge on one of the pillars. One was several times the size of the ordinary glasses – black, thin and decorated with a complicated skull-and-bones motif. That wasn\u0027t the most unpleasant thing about it. Mort groaned inwardly. He couldn\u0027t see any sand in there. The smaller glass beside it was quite plain and unadorned. Mort reached for it. \u0027May I?\u0027 he said. BE MY GUEST. The name Mort was engraved on the top bulb. He held it up to the light, noting without any real surprise that there was hardly any sand left. When he held it to his ear he thought he could hear, even above the ever-present roar of the millions of lifetimers around him, the sound of his own life pouring away. He put it down very carefully. Death turned to Cutwell. MR WIZARD, SIR, YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE US A COUNT OF THREE. Cutwell nodded glumly. \u0027Are you sure this couldn\u0027t all be sorted out by getting around a table —\u0027 he began. NO. \u0027No.\u0027 Mort and Death circled one another warily, their reflections flickering across the banks of hourglasses. \u0027One,\u0027said Cutwell. Death spun his scythe menacingly. \u0027Two.\u0027 The blades met in mid-air with a noise like a cat sliding down a pane of glass. \u0027They both cheated!\u0027 said Keli. Ysabell nodded. \u0027Of course,\u0027 she said. Mort jumped back, bringing the sword round in a too-slow arc that Death easily deflected, turning the parry into a wicked low sweep that Mort avoided only by a clumsy standing jump.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-33.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.
