{"id":95327,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"There was a warming pan on the flagstones by the fire. Would it make a weapon?\\n\\n There was a faint metallic sound.\\n\\n Perhaps screaming wouldn\u0027t be such a bad idea after all. . . .\\n\\n The window imploded. For an instant Keli saw, framed against a hell of blue and purple flames, a hooded figure crouched on the back of the largest horse she had ever seen.\\n\\n There was someone standing by the bed, with a knife half raised.\\n\\n In slow motion, she watched fascinated as the arm went up and the horse galloped at glacier speed across the floor. Now the knife was above her, starting its descent, and the horse was rearing and the rider was standing in the stirrups and swinging some sort of weapon and its blade tore through the slow air with a noise like a finger on the rim of a wet glass —\\n\\n The light vanished. There was a soft thump on the floor, followed by a metallic clatter.\\n\\n Keli took a deep breath.\\n\\n A hand was briefly laid across her mouth and a worried voice said, \u0027If you scream, I\u0027ll regret it. Please? I\u0027m in enough trouble as it is.\u0027\\n\\n Anyone who could get that amount of bewildered pleading into their voice was either genuine or such a good actor they wouldn\u0027t have to bother with assassination for a living. She said, \u0027Who are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m allowed to tell you,\u0027 said the voice. \u0027You are still alive, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n She bit down the sarcastic reply just in time. Something about the tone of the question worried her.\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t you tell?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not easy. . . .\u0027 There was a pause. She strained to see in the darkness, to put a face around that voice. \u0027I may have done you some terrible harm,\u0027it added.\\n\\n \u0027Haven\u0027t you just saved my life?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what I have saved, actually. Is there some light around here?\u0027\\n\\n The maid sometimes leaves matches on the mantelpiece,\u0027 said Keli. She felt the presence beside her move away. There were a few hesitant footsteps, a couple of thumps, and finally a clang, although the word isn\u0027t sufficient to describe the real ripe cacophony of falling metal that filled the room. It was even followed by the traditional little tinkle a couple of seconds after you thought it was all over.\\n\\n The voice said, rather indistinctly, \u0027I\u0027m under a suit of armour. Where should I be?\u0027\\n\\n Keli slid quietly out of bed, felt her way towards the fireplace, located the bundle of matches by the faint light from the dying fire, struck one in a burst of sulphurous smoke, lit a candle, found the pile of dismembered armour, pulled its sword from its scabbard and then nearly swallowed her tongue.\\n\\n Someone had just blown hot and wetly in her ear.\\n\\n That\u0027s Binky,\u0027 said the heap. \u0027He\u0027s just trying to be friendly. I expect he\u0027d like some hay, if you\u0027ve got any.\u0027\\n\\n With royal self-control, Keli said, This is the fourth floor. It\u0027s a lady\u0027s bedroom. You\u0027d be amazed at how many horses we don\u0027t get up here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh. Could you help me up, please?\u0027\\n\\n She put the sword down and pulled aside a breastplate. A thin white face stared back at her.\\n\\n \u0027First, you\u0027d better tell me why I shouldn\u0027t send for the guards anyway,\u0027 she said. \u0027Even being in my bedroom could get you tortured to death.\u0027\\n\\n She glared at him.\\n\\n Finally he said, \u0027Well – could you let my hand free, please? Thank you – firstly, the guards probably wouldn\u0027t see me, secondly, you\u0027ll never find out why I\u0027m here and you look as though you\u0027d hate not to know, and thirdly. . . .\u0027\\n\\n Thirdly what?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n His mouth opened and shut. Mort wanted to say: thirdly, you\u0027re so beautiful, or at least very attractive, or anyway far more attractive than any other girl I\u0027ve ever met, although admittedly I haven\u0027t met very many. From this it will be seen that Mort\u0027s innate honesty will never make him a poet; if Mort ever compared a girl to a summer\u0027s day, it would be followed by a thoughtful explanation of what day he had in mind and whether it was raining at the time. In the circumstances, it was just as well that he couldn\u0027t find his voice.\\n\\n Keli held up the candle and looked at the window.\\n\\n It was whole. The stone frames were unbroken. Every pane, with its stained-glass representatives of the Sto Lat coat of arms, was complete. She looked back at Mort.\\n\\n \u0027Never mind thirdly,\u0027 she said, \u0027let\u0027s get back to secondly.\u0027\\n\\n An hour later dawn reached the city. Daylight on the Disc flows rather than rushes, because light is slowed right down by the world\u0027s standing magical field, and it rolled across the flat lands like a golden sea. The city on the mound stood out like a sandcastle in the tide for a moment, until the day swirled around it and crept onwards.\\n\\n Mort and Keli sat side by side on her bed. The hourglass lay between them. There was no sand left in the top bulb.\\n\\n From outside came the sounds of the castle waking up.\\n\\n \u0027I still don\u0027t understand this,\u0027 she said. \u0027Does it mean I\u0027m dead, or doesn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It means you ought to be dead,\u0027 he said, \u0027according to fate or whatever. I haven\u0027t really studied the theory,\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you should have killed me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No! I mean, no, the assassin should have killed you. I did try to explain all that,\u0027 said Mort.\\n\\n \u0027Why didn\u0027t you let him?\u0027\\n\\n Mort looked at her in horror.\\n\\n \u0027Did you want to die?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course I didn\u0027t. But it looks as though what people want doesn\u0027t come into it, does it? I\u0027m trying to be sensible about this.\u0027\\n\\n Mort stared at his knees. Then he stood up.\\n\\n \u0027I think I\u0027d better be going,\u0027 he said coldly.\\n\\n He folded up the scythe and stuck it into its sheath behind the saddle. Then he looked at the window.\\n\\n \u0027You came through that,\u0027 said Keli, helpfully. \u0027Look, when I said —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does it open?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. There\u0027s a balcony along the passage. But people will see you!\u0027\\n\\n Mort ignored her, pulled open the door and led Binky out into the corridor. Keli ran after them. A maid stopped, curtsied, and frowned slightly as her brain wisely dismissed the sight of a very large horse walking along the carpet.\\n\\n The balcony overlooked one of the inner courtyards. Mort glanced over the parapet, and then mounted.\\n\\n \u0027Watch out for the duke,\u0027 he said. \u0027He\u0027s behind all this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My father always warned me about him,\u0027 said the princess. \u0027I\u0027ve got a foodtaster.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You should get a bodyguard as well,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027I must go. I have important things to do. Farewell,\u0027 he added, in what he hoped was the right tone of injured pride.\\n\\n \u0027Shall I see you again?\u0027 said Keli. \u0027There\u0027s lots I want to —\u0027\\n\\n That might not be a good idea, if you think about it,\u0027 said Mort haughtily. He clicked his tongue, and Binky leapt into the air, cleared the parapet and cantered up into the blue morning sky.\\n\\n \u0027I wanted to say thank you!\u0027 Keli yelled after him.\\n\\n The maid, who couldn\u0027t get over the feeling that something was wrong and had followed her, said, \u0027Are you all right, ma\u0027am?\u0027\\n\\n Keli looked at her distractedly.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 she demanded.\\n\\n \u0027I just wondered if – everything was all right?\u0027\\n\\n Keli\u0027s shoulders sagged.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said. \u0027Everything\u0027s all wrong. There\u0027s a dead assassin in my bedroom. Could you please have something done about it?\\n\\n \u0027And —\u0027 she held up a hand – \u0027I don\u0027t want you to say “Dead, ma\u0027am?” or “Assassin, ma\u0027am?” or scream or anything, I just want you to get something done about it. Quietly. I think I\u0027ve got a headache. So just nod.\u0027\\n\\n The maid nodded, bobbed uncertainly, and backed away.\\n\\n Mort wasn\u0027t sure how he got back. The sky simply changed from ice blue to sullen grey as Binky eased himself into the gap between dimensions. He didn\u0027t land on the dark soil of Death\u0027s estate, it was simply there, underfoot, as though an aircraft carrier had gently manoeuvred itself under a jump jet to save the pilot all the trouble of touching down.\\n\\n The great horse trotted into the stableyard and halted outside the double door, swishing his tail. Mort slid off and ran for the house.\\n\\n And stopped, and ran back, and filled the hayrack, and ran for the house, and stopped and muttered to himself and ran back and rubbed the horse down and checked the water bucket, and ran for the house, and ran back and fetched the horseblanket down from its hook on the wall and buckled it on. Binky gave him a dignified nuzzle.\\n\\n No-one seemed to be about as Mort slipped in by the back door and made his way to the library, where even at this time of night the air seemed to be made of hot dry dust. It seemed to take years to locate Princess Keli\u0027s biography, but he found it eventually. It was a depressingly slim volume on a shelf only reachable by the library ladder, a wheeled rickety structure that strongly resembled an early siege engine.\\n\\n With trembling fingers he opened it at the last page, and groaned.\\n\\n \u0027The princess\u0027s assassination at the age of fifteen,\u0027 he read, \u0027was followed by the union of Sto Lat with Sto Helit and, indirectly, the collapse of the city states of the central plain and the rise of—\u0027\\n\\n He read on, unable to stop. Occasionally he groaned again.\\n\\n Finally he put the book back, hesitated, and then shoved it behind a few other volumes. He could still feel it there as he climbed down the ladder, shrieking its incriminating existence to the world.\\n\\n There were few ocean-going ships on the Disc. No captain liked to venture out of sight of a coastline. It was a sorry fact that ships which looked from a distance as though they were going over the edge of the world weren\u0027t in fact disappearing over the horizon, they were in fact dropping over the edge of the world.\\n\\n Every generation or so a few enthusiastic explorers doubted this and set out to prove it wrong. Strangely enough, none of them had ever come back to announce the result of their researches.\\n\\n The following analogy would, therefore, have been meaningless to Mort.\\n\\n He felt as if he\u0027d been shipwrecked on the Titanic but in the nick of time had been rescued. By the Lusitonia.\\n\\n He felt as though he\u0027d thrown a snowball on the spur of the moment and watched the ensuing avalanche engulf three ski resorts.\\n\\n He felt history unravelling all around him.\\n\\n He felt he needed someone to talk to, quickly.\\n\\n That had to mean either Albert or Ysabell, because the thought of explaining everything to those tiny blue pinpoints was not one he cared to contemplate after a long night. On the rare occasions Ysabell deigned to look in his direction she made it clear that the only difference between Mort and a dead toad was the colour. As for Albert. . . .\\n\\n All right, not the perfect confidant, but definitely the best in a field of one.\\n\\n Mort slid down the steps and threaded his way back through the bookshelves. A few hours\u0027 sleep would be a good idea, too.\\n\\n Then he heard a gasp, the brief patter of running feet, and the slam of a door. When he peered around the nearest bookcase there was nothing there except a stool with a couple of books on it. He picked one up and glanced at the name, then read a few pages. There was a damp lace handkerchief lying next to it.\\n\\n Mort rose late, and hurried towards the kitchen expecting at any moment the deep tones of disapproval. Nothing happened.\\n\\n Albert was at the stone sink, gazing thoughtfully at his chip pan, probably wondering whether it was time to change the fat or let it bide for another year. He turned as Mort slid into a chair.\\n\\n \u0027You had a busy tune of it, then,\u0027 he said. \u0027Gallivanting all over the place until all hours, I heard. I could do you an egg. Or there\u0027s porridge.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Egg, please,\u0027 said Mort. He\u0027d never plucked up the courage to try Albert\u0027s porridge, which led a private life of its own in the depths of its saucepan and ate spoons.\\n\\n \u0027The master wants to see you after,\u0027 Albert added, \u0027but he said you wasn\u0027t to rush.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh.\u0027 Mort stared at the table. \u0027Did he say anything else?\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-12.html","bookId":1623,"book":{"id":1623,"title":"Mort (Discworld #4)","description":"Storyline: Mort (Discworld #4) \\n Terry Pratchett\u0027s profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England, where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen. \\n In this Discworld installment, Death comes to Mort with an offer he can\u0027t refuse -- especially since being, well, dead isn\u0027t compulsory.As Death\u0027s apprentice, he\u0027ll have free board and lodging, use of the company horse, and he won\u0027t need time off for family funerals.
