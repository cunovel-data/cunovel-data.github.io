The room was the size of a closet. She turned to the mirrored window, her hands fisted at her sides, and looked at the woman who had given her life and then had so desperately tried to take it away.\\n\\n John Paul slipped his hand in hers and asked, “Do you remember her?”\\n\\n “No. I was only five when she came to the house,” she whispered. “So long ago.”\\n\\n Jilly sat on one side of the square metal table facing two detectives. Her back was straight, one leg crossed over the other, her hands folded on the table. The top three buttons of her eyelet blouse were undone, and the neckline opened a little wider each time she moved ever so slightly. She suddenly turned and looked directly at the mirror. Avery inhaled sharply and drew back as she felt the bile rising in her throat.\\n\\n “Look,” Avery whispered.\\n\\n “I see her,” John Paul said.\\n\\n Avery shook her head. “Not her. Look at the detectives. Look how they’re reacting to her.”\\n\\n Both detectives were leaning forward, as though they were unconsciously trying to get closer to her. One said something and then reached out and touched her hand.\\n\\n “She’s working them,” Avery said.\\n\\n A policeman opened the door to the interrogation room. Jilly looked up at him, then, like a languorous Persian cat, she stretched her lithe body and stood. As she followed him out the door, she paused to glance back over her shoulder and smile at the two men. Both detectives eagerly returned the smile. They watched her every movement until the door closed behind her.\\n\\n Avery looked into John Paul’s eyes. “I’m ready to move on now.”\\n\\n She led the way out of the police station. She didn’t look back.\\n\\n Epilogue\\n\\n SUNSET WAS AVERY’S FAVORITE TIME OF DAY. SHE’D GO OUT side and sit on the porch swing John Paul had built for her. She could hear the water lapping against the dock behind the house, and if she closed her eyes, she could almost smell the lilacs John Paul had planted.\\n\\n The screen door opened and closed, and her husband sat down next to her. He put his arm around her, leaned back, and gave the swing a push.\\n\\n “You ready for school tomorrow, sugar?”\\n\\n “Yes.”\\n\\n “What were you thinking about?” he asked. “Were you going to your happy place?”\\n\\n She put her head on his shoulder and smiled. “I’m already there.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killjoy-buchanan-renard-3/page-49.html","bookId":1833,"book":{"id":1833,"title":"Killjoy (Buchanan-Renard #3)","description":"Storyline: Avery Delaney has always tried to put the past far behind her. Abandoned by her rapacious, conniving mother when she was only three days old, Avery was raised by her grandmother and beloved aunt Carolyn. Then, when she was eleven, she witnessed her grandmother\u0027s violent death, before Avery herself was shot and left for dead. Miraculously she survived. The man responsible is serving time in a Florida prison. This traumatic experience propels Avery into a life of law and order. \\n Her razor-sharp mind and ability to gather data and decipher evidence has made Avery an expert crime analyst for the FBI. But soon she will have to use every one of her adroit skills on a case that hits painfully close to home. \\n Avery\u0027s workaholic aunt, Carolyn Salvetti, is certain her (hopefully soon-to-be ex) husband sent her the gold embossed reservation to the posh Utopia Spa in the mountains of Colorado. At first she is resistant, but then figures it will be a welcome respite from the cutthroat advertising business, not to mention a networking extravaganza. Plus she persuades her niece to join her for the two weeks of luxury and decadence. \\n But Carolyn never makes it to Utopia. Under false pretenses, she is taken to an isolated retreat by a handsome stranger with a dazzling smile, suave demeanor, and the darkest of motives. His name is Monk, a hired assassin. Now, with scant clues and fewer resources, Avery must track down and save Carolyn--and outmaneuver a brilliant killer who is part of an elaborate plot of madness and lethal vengeance.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/killjoy-buchanan-renard-3.jpg","author":"Julie Garwood","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/killjoy-buchanan-renard-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:01 PM"}}
