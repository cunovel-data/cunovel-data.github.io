{"id":22150,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"This chapter is dedicated to Chapters/Indigo, the national Canadianmegachain. I was working at Bakka, the independent science fictionbookstore, when Chapters opened its first store in Toronto and I knewthat something big was going on right away, because two of oursmartest, best-informed customers stopped in to tell me that they\u0027d beenhired to run the science fiction section. From the start, Chapters raisedthe bar on what a big corporate bookstore could be, extending its hours,adding a friendly cafe and lots of seating, installing in-store self-serviceterminals and stocking the most amazing variety of titles. \n Chapters/IndigoI blogged the press-conference even before I\u0027d sent out the invitationsto the press. I could tell that all these writers wanted to make me into aleader or a general or a supreme guerrilla commandant, and I figuredone way of solving that would be to have a bunch of Xnetters runningaround answering questions too. \n Then I emailed the press. The responses ranged from puzzled to en-thusiastic — only the Fox reporter was \"outraged\" that I had the gall toask her to play a game in order to appear on her TV show. The rest ofthem seemed to think that it would make a pretty cool story, thoughplenty of them wanted lots of tech support for signing onto the gameI picked 8PM, after dinner. Mom had been bugging me about all theevenings I\u0027d been spending out of the house until I finally spilled thebeans about Ange, whereupon she came over all misty and kept lookingat me like, my-little-boy\u0027s-growing-up. She wanted to meet Ange, and Iused that as leverage, promising to bring her over the next night if Icould \"go to the movies\" with Ange tonight. \n Ange\u0027s mom and sister were out again — they weren\u0027t real stay-at-homes — which left me and Ange alone in her room with her Xbox and194mine. I unplugged one of her bedside screens and attached my Xbox to itso that we could both login at once. \n Both Xboxes were idle, logged into Clockwork Plunder. I was pacing. \n \"It\u0027s going to be fine,\" she said. She glanced at her screen. \"PatcheyePete\u0027s Market has 600 players in it now!\" We\u0027d picked Patcheye Pete\u0027s be-cause it was the market closest to the village square where new playersspawned. If the reporters weren\u0027t already Clockwork Plunder players —ha! — then that\u0027s where they\u0027d show up. In my blog post I\u0027d askedpeople generally to hang out on the route between Patcheye Pete\u0027s andthe spawn-gate and direct anyone who looked like a disoriented reporterover to Pete\u0027s. \n \"What the hell am I going to tell them?\"\"You just answer their questions — and if you don\u0027t like a question, ig-nore it. Someone else can answer it. It\u0027ll be fine.\"\"This is insane.\"\"This is perfect, Marcus. If you want to really screw the DHS, you haveto embarrass them. It\u0027s not like you\u0027re going to be able to out-shoot them. \n Your only weapon is your ability to make them look like morons.\"I flopped on the bed and she pulled my head into her lap and strokedmy hair. I\u0027d been playing around with different haircuts before thebombing, dying it all kinds of funny colors, but since I\u0027d gotten out of jailI couldn\u0027t be bothered. It had gotten long and stupid and shaggy and I\u0027dgone into the bathroom and grabbed my clippers and buzzed it down tohalf an inch all around, which took zero effort to take care of and helpedme to be invisible when I was out jamming and cloning arphids. \n I opened my eyes and stared into her big brown eyes behind herglasses. They were round and liquid and expressive. She could makethem bug out when she wanted to make me laugh, or make them softand sad, or lazy and sleepy in a way that made me melt into a puddle ofhorniness. \n That\u0027s what she was doing right now. \n I sat up slowly and hugged her. She hugged me back. We kissed. Shewas an amazing kisser. I know I\u0027ve already said that, but it bears repeat-ing. We kissed a lot, but for one reason or another we always stopped be-fore it got too heavy. \n Now I wanted to go farther. I found the hem of her t-shirt and tugged. \n She put her hands over her head and pulled back a few inches. I knewthat she\u0027d do that. I\u0027d known since the night in the park. Maybe that\u0027s195why we hadn\u0027t gone farther — I knew I couldn\u0027t rely on her to back off,which scared me a little. \n But I wasn\u0027t scared then. The impending press-conference, the fightswith my parents, the international attention, the sense that there was amovement that was careening around the city like a wild pinball — itmade my skin tingle and my blood sing. \n And she was beautiful, and smart, and clever and funny, and I wasfalling in love with her. \n Her shirt slid off, her arching her back to help me get it over hershoulders. She reached behind her and did something and her bra fellaway. I stared goggle-eyed, motionless and breathless, and then shegrabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head, grabbing me and pullingmy bare chest to hers. \n We rolled on the bed and touched each other and ground our bodiestogether and groaned. She kissed all over my chest and I did the same toher. I couldn\u0027t breathe, I couldn\u0027t think, I could only move and kiss andlick and touch. \n We dared each other to go forward. I undid her jeans. She undid mine. \n I lowered her zipper, she did mine, and tugged my jeans off. I tugged offhers. A moment later we were both naked, except for my socks, which Ipeeled off with my toes. \n It was then that I caught sight of the bedside clock, which had longago rolled onto the floor and lay there, glowing up at us. \n \"Crap!\" I yelped. \"It starts in two minutes!\" I couldn\u0027t freaking believethat I was about to stop what I was about to stop doing, when I wasabout to stop doing it. I mean, if you\u0027d asked me, \"Marcus, you are aboutto get laid for the firstest time EVAR, will you stop if I let off this nuclearbomb in the same room as you?\" the answer would have been a resound-ing and unequivical NO. \n And yet we stopped for this. \n She grabbed me and pulled my face to hers and kissed me until Ithought I would pass out, then we both grabbed our clothes and more orless dressed, grabbing our keyboards and mice and heading for PatcheyePete\u0027s. \n You could easily tell who the press were: they were the noobs whoplayed their characters like staggering drunks, weaving back and forthand up and down, trying to get the hang of it all, occasionally hitting the196wrong key and offering strangers all or part of their inventory, or givingthem accidental hugs and kicks. \n The Xnetters were easy to spot, too: we all played Clockwork Plunderwhenever we had some spare time (or didn\u0027t feel like doing our home-work), and we had pretty tricked-out characters with cool weapons andbooby-traps on the keys sticking out of our backs that would cream any-one who tried to snatch them and leave us to wind down. \n When I appeared, a system status message displayed M1K3Y HASENTERED PATCHEYE PETE\u0027S — WELCOME SWABBIE WE OFFERFAIR TRADE FOR FINE BOOTY. All the players on the screen froze,then they crowded around me. The chat exploded. I thought about turn-ing on my voice-paging and grabbing a headset, but seeing how manypeople were trying to talk at once, I realized how confusing that wouldbe. Text was much easier to follow and they couldn\u0027t misquote me (hehheh). \n I\u0027d scouted the location before with Ange — it was great campaigningwith her, since we could both keep each other wound up. There was ahigh-spot on a pile of boxes of salt-rations that I could stand on and beseen from anywhere in the market. \n \u003e \n Good evening and thank you all for coming. My name is M1k3y andI\u0027m not the leader of anything. All around you are Xnetters who have asmuch to say about why we\u0027re here as I do. I use the Xnet because I be-lieve in freedom and the Constitution of the United States of America. Iuse Xnet because the DHS has turned my city into a police-state wherewe\u0027re all suspected terrorists. I use Xnet because I think you can\u0027t defendfreedom by tearing up the Bill of Rights. I learned about the Constitutionin a California school and I was raised to love my country for its free-dom. If I have a philosophy, it is this: \n \u003e \n Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powersfrom the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of govern-ment becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to al-ter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundationon such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to themshall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. \n \u003e \n 197I didn\u0027t write that, but I believe it. The DHS does not govern with myconsent. \n \u003e \n Thank youI\u0027d written this the day before, bouncing drafts back and forth withAnge. Pasting it in only took a second, though it took everyone in thegame a moment to read it. A lot of the Xnetters cheered, big showy pirate\"Hurrah\"s with raised sabers and pet parrots squawking and flyingoverhead. \n Gradually, the journalists digested it too. The chat was running pastfast, so fast you could barely read it, lots of Xnetters saying things like\"Right on\" and \"America, love it or leave it\" and \"DHS go home\" and\"America out of San Francisco,\" all slogans that had been big on the Xnetblogosphere. \n \u003e \n M1k3y, this is Priya Rajneesh from the BBC. You say you\u0027re not theleader of any movement, but do you believe there is a movement? Is itcalled the Xnet? \n Lots of answers. Some people said there wasn\u0027t a movement, somesaid there was and lots of people had ideas about what it was called: \n Xnet, Little Brothers, Little Sisters, and my personal favorite, the UnitedStates of America. \n They were really cooking. I let them go, thinking of what I could say. \n Once I had it, I typed,\u003e \n I think that kind of answers your question, doesn\u0027t it? There may beone or more movements and they may be called Xnet or not. \n \u003e \n M1k3y, I\u0027m Doug Christensen from the Washington Internet Daily. \n What do you think the DHS should be doing to prevent another attackon San Francisco, if what they\u0027re doing isn\u0027t successful. \n More chatter. Lots of people said that the terrorists and the govern-ment were the same — either literally, or just meaning that they wereequally bad. Some said the government knew how to catch terrorists butpreferred not to because \"war presidents\" got re-elected. \n \u003e \n I don\u0027t know198I typed finally. \n \u003e \n I really don\u0027t. I ask myself this question a lot because I don\u0027t want toget blown up and I don\u0027t want my city to get blown up. Here\u0027s what I\u0027vefigured out, though: if it\u0027s the DHS\u0027s job to keep us safe, they\u0027re failing. \n All the crap they\u0027ve done, none of it would stop the bridge from beingblown up again. Tracing us around the city? Taking away our freedom? \n Making us suspicious of each other, turning us against each other? \n Calling dissenters traitors? The point of terrorism is to terrify us. TheDHS terrifies me. \n \u003e \n I don\u0027t have any say in what the terrorists do to me, but if this is a freecountry then I should be able to at least say what my own cops do to me. \n I should be able to keep them from terrorizing me. \n \u003e \n I know that\u0027s not a good answer. Sorry. \n \u003e \n What do you mean when you say that the DHS wouldn\u0027t stop terror-ists? How do you know? \n \u003e \n Who are you? \n \u003e \n I\u0027m with the Sydney Morning Herald. \n \u003e \n I\u0027m 17 years old. I\u0027m not a straight-A student or anything. Even so, Ifigured out how to make an Internet that they can\u0027t wiretap. I figured outhow to jam their person-tracking technology. I can turn innocent peopleinto suspects and turn guilty people into innocents in their eyes. I couldget metal onto an airplane or beat a no-fly list. I figured this stuff out bylooking at the web and by thinking about it. If I can do it, terrorists cando it. They told us they took away our freedom to make us safe. Do youfeel safe? \n \u003e \n In Australia? Why yes I doThe pirates all laughed. \n 199More journalists asked questions. Some were sympathetic, some werehostile. When I got tired, I handed my keyboard to Ange and let her beM1k3y for a while. It didn\u0027t really feel like M1k3y and me were the sameperson anymore anyway. M1k3y was the kind of kid who talked to inter-national journalists and inspired a movement. Marcus got suspendedfrom school and fought with his dad and wondered if he was goodenough for his kick-ass girlfriend. \n By 11PM I\u0027d had enough. Besides, my parents would be expecting mehome soon. I logged out of the game and so did Ange and we lay therefor a moment. I took her hand and she squeezed hard. We hugged. \n She kissed my neck and murmured something. \n \"What?\"\"I said I love you,\" she said. \"What, you want me to send you atelegram?\"\"Wow,\" I said. \n \"You\u0027re that surprised, huh?\"\"No. Um. It\u0027s just — I was going to say that to you.\"\"Sure you were,\" she said, and bit the tip of my nose. \n \"It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve never said it before,\" I said. \"So I was working up toit.\"\"You still haven\u0027t said it, you know. Don\u0027t think I haven\u0027t noticed. Wegirls pick upon these things.\"\"I love you, Ange Carvelli,\" I said. \n \"I love you too, Marcus Yallow.\"We kissed and nuzzled and I started to breathe hard and so did she. \n That\u0027s when her mom knocked on the door. \n \"Angela,\" she said, \"I think it\u0027s time your friend went home, don\u0027tyou?\"\"Yes, mother,\" she said, and mimed swinging an axe. As I put mysocks and shoes on, she muttered, \"They\u0027ll say, that Angela, she was sucha good girl, who would have thought it, all the time she was in the backyard, helping her mother out by sharpening that hatchet.\"I laughed. \"You don\u0027t know how easy you have it. There is no way myfolks would leave us alone in my bedroom until 11 o\u0027clock.\"\"11:45,\" she said, checking her clock. \n \"Crap!\" I yelped and tied my shoes. \n 200\"Go,\" she said, \"run and be free! Look both ways before crossing theroad! Write if you get work! Don\u0027t even stop for a hug! If you\u0027re not outof here by the count of ten, there\u0027s going to be trouble, mister. One. Two. \n Three.\"I shut her up by leaping onto the bed, landing on her and kissing heruntil she stopped trying to count. Satisfied with my victory, I poundeddown the stairs, my Xbox under my arm. \n Her mom was at the foot of the stairs. We\u0027d only met a couple times. \n She looked like an older, taller version of Ange — Ange said her fatherwas the short one — with contacts instead of glasses. She seemed to havetentatively classed me as a good guy, I and appreciated it. \n \"Good night, Mrs Carvelli,\" I said. \n \"Good night, Mr Yallow,\" she said. It was one of our little rituals, eversince I\u0027d called her Mrs Carvelli when we first met. \n I found myself standing awkwardly by the door. \n \"Yes?\" she said. \n \"Um,\" I said. \"Thanks for having me over.\"\"You\u0027re always welcome in our home, young man,\" she said. \n \"And thanks for Ange,\" I said finally, hating how lame it sounded. Butshe smiled broadly and gave me a brief hug. \n \"You\u0027re very welcome,\" she said. \n The whole bus ride home, I thought over the press-conference,thought about Ange naked and writhing with me on her bed, thoughtabout her mother smiling and showing me the door. \n My mom was waiting up for me. She asked me about the movie and Igave her the response I\u0027d worked out in advance, cribbing from the re-view it had gotten in the Bay Guardian. \n As I fell asleep, the press-conference came back. I was really proud ofit. It had been so cool, to have all these big-shot journos show up in thegame, to have them listen to me and to have them listen to all the peoplewho believed in the same things as me. I dropped off with a smile on mylips. \n I should have known better. \n XNET LEADER: I COULD GET METAL ONTO AN AIRPLANEDHS DOESN\u0027T HAVE MY CONSENT TO GOVERN201XNET KIDS: USA OUT OF SAN FRANCISCOThose were the good headlines. Everyone sent me the articles to blog,but it was the last thing I wanted to do. \n I\u0027d blown it, somehow. The press had come to my press-conferenceand concluded that we were terrorists or terrorist dupes. The worst wasthe reporter on Fox News, who had apparently shown up anyway, andwho devoted a ten-minute commentary to us, talking about our\"criminal treason.\" Her killer line, repeated on every news-outlet I found,was: \n \"They say they don\u0027t have a name. I\u0027ve got one for them. Let\u0027s callthese spoiled children Cal-Quaeda. They do the terrorists\u0027 work on thehome front. When — not if, but when — California gets attacked again,these brats will be as much to blame as the House of Saud.\"Leaders of the anti-war movement denounced us as fringe elements. \n One guy went on TV to say that he believed we had been fabricated bythe DHS to discredit them. \n The DHS had their own press-conference announcing that they woulddouble the security in San Francisco. They held up an arphid clonerthey\u0027d found somewhere and demonstrated it in action, using it to stagea car-theft, and warned everyone to be on their alert for young peoplebehaving suspiciously, especially those whose hands were out of sight. \n They weren\u0027t kidding. I finished my Kerouac paper and started in on apaper about the Summer of Love, the summer of 1967 when the anti-warmovement and the hippies converged on San Francisco. The guys whofounded Ben and Jerry\u0027s — old hippies themselves — had founded a hip-pie museum in the Haight, and there were other archives and exhibits tosee around town. \n But it wasn\u0027t easy getting around. By the end of the week, I was gettingfrisked an average of four times a day. Cops checked my ID and ques-tioned me about why I was out in the street, carefully eyeballing the let-ter from Chavez saying that I was suspended. \n I got lucky. No one arrested me. But the rest of the Xnet weren\u0027t solucky. Every night the DHS announced more arrests, \"ringleaders\" and\"operatives\" of Xnet, people I didn\u0027t know and had never heard of,paraded on TV along with the arphid sniffers and other devices that hadbeen in their pockets. They announced that the people were \"namingnames,\" compromising the \"Xnet network\" and that more arrests wereexpected soon. The name \"M1k3y\" was often heard. \n 202Dad loved this. He and I watched the news together, him gloating, meshrinking away, quietly freaking out. \"You should see the stuff they\u0027regoing to use on these kids,\" Dad said. \"I\u0027ve seen it in action. They\u0027ll get acouple of these kids and check out their friends lists on IM and thespeed-dials on their phones, look for names that come up over and over,look for patterns, bringing in more kids. They\u0027re going to unravel themlike an old sweater.\"I canceled Ange\u0027s dinner at our place and started spending even moretime there. Ange\u0027s little sister Tina started to call me \"the house-guest,\" asin \"is the house-guest eating dinner with me tonight?\" I liked Tina. Allshe cared about was going out and partying and meeting guys, but shewas funny and utterly devoted to Ange. One night as we were doing thedishes, she dried her hands and said, conversationally, \"You know, youseem like a nice guy, Marcus. My sister\u0027s just crazy about you and I likeyou too. But I have to tell you something: if you break her heart, I willtrack you down and pull your scrotum over your head. It\u0027s not a prettysight.\"I assured her that I would sooner pull my own scrotum over my headthan break Ange\u0027s heart and she nodded. \"So long as we\u0027re clear on that.\"\"Your sister is a nut,\" I said as we lay on Ange\u0027s bed again, looking atXnet blogs. That is pretty much all we did: fool around and read Xnet. \n \"Did she use the scrotum line on you? I hate it when she does that. Shejust loves the word \u0027scrotum,\u0027 you know. It\u0027s nothing personal.\"I kissed her. We read some more. \n \"Listen to this,\" she said. \"Police project four to six hundred arrests thisweekend in what they say will be the largest coordinated raid on Xnetdissidents to date.\"I felt like throwing up. \n \"We\u0027ve got to stop this,\" I said. \"You know there are people who aredoing more jamming to show that they\u0027re not intimidated? Isn\u0027t that justcrazy?\"\"I think it\u0027s brave,\" she said. \"We can\u0027t let them scare us intosubmission.\"\"What? No, Ange, no. We can\u0027t let hundreds of people go to jail. Youhaven\u0027t been there. I have. It\u0027s worse than you think. It\u0027s worse than youcan imagine.\"\"I have a pretty fertile imagination,\" she said. \n 203\"Stop it, OK? Be serious for a second. I won\u0027t do this. I won\u0027t sendthose people to jail. If I do, I\u0027m the guy that Van thinks I am.\"\"Marcus, I\u0027m being serious. You think that these people don\u0027t knowthey could go to jail? They believe in the cause. You believe in it too. \n Give them the credit to know what they\u0027re getting into. It\u0027s not up to youto decide what risks they can or can\u0027t take.\"\"It\u0027s my responsibility because if I tell them to stop, they\u0027ll stop.\"\"I thought you weren\u0027t the leader?\"\"I\u0027m not, of course I\u0027m not. But I can\u0027t help it if they look to me forguidance. And so long as they do, I have a responsibility to help themstay safe. You see that, right?\"\"All I see is you getting ready to cut and run at the first sign of trouble. \n I think you\u0027re afraid they\u0027re going to figure out who you are. I thinkyou\u0027re afraid for you.\"\"That\u0027s not fair,\" I said, sitting up, pulling away from her. \n \"Really? Who\u0027s the guy who nearly had a heart attack when hethought that his secret identity was out?\"\"That was different,\" I said. \"This isn\u0027t about me. You know it isn\u0027t. \n Why are you being like this?\"\"Why are you like this?\" she said. \"Why aren\u0027t you willing to be the guywho was brave enough to get all this started?\"\"This isn\u0027t brave, it\u0027s suicide.\"\"Cheap teenage melodrama, M1k3y.\"\"Don\u0027t call me that!\"\"What, \u0027M1k3y\u0027? Why not, M1k3y?\"I put my shoes on. I picked up my bag. I walked home. \n \u003e \n Why I\u0027m not jamming\u003e \n I won\u0027t tell anyone else what to do, because I\u0027m not anyone\u0027s leader, nomatter what Fox News thinks. \n \u003e \n But I am going to tell you what I plan on doing. If you think that\u0027s theright thing to do, maybe you\u0027ll do it too. \n 204\u003e \n I\u0027m not jamming. Not this week. Maybe not next. It\u0027s not because I\u0027mscared. It\u0027s because I\u0027m smart enough to know that I\u0027m better free than inprison. They figured out how to stop our tactic, so we need to come upwith a new tactic. I don\u0027t care what the tactic is, but I want it to work. It\u0027sstupid to get arrested. It\u0027s only jamming if you get away with it. \n \u003e \n There\u0027s another reason not to jam. If you get caught, they might useyou to catch your friends, and their friends, and their friends. Theymight bust your friends even if they\u0027re not on Xnet, because the DHS islike a maddened bull and they don\u0027t exactly worry if they\u0027ve got the rightguy. \n \u003e \n I\u0027m not telling you what to do. \n \u003e \n But the DHS is dumb and we\u0027re smart. Jamming proves that they can\u0027tfight terrorism because it proves that they can\u0027t even stop a bunch ofkids. If you get caught, it makes them look like they\u0027re smarter than us. \n \u003e \n THEY AREN\u0027T SMARTER THAN US! We are smarter than them. Let\u0027sbe smart. Let\u0027s figure out how to jam them, no matter how many goonsthey put on the streets of our city. \n I posted it. I went to bed. \n I missed Ange. \n Ange and I didn\u0027t speak for the next four days, including the weekend,and then it was time to go back to school. I\u0027d almost called her a milliontimes, written a thousand unsent emails and IMs. \n Now I was back in Social Studies class, and Mrs Andersen greeted mewith voluble, sarcastic courtesy, asking me sweetly how my \"holiday\"had been. I sat down and mumbled nothing. I could hear Charlessnicker. \n She taught us a class on Manifest Destiny, the idea that the Americanswere destined to take over the whole world (or at least that\u0027s how shemade it seem) and seemed to be trying to provoke me into sayingsomething so she could throw me out. \n 205I felt the eyes of the class on me, and it reminded me of M1k3y and thepeople who looked up to him. I was sick of being looked up to. I missedAnge. \n I got through the rest of the day without anything making any kind ofmark on me. I don\u0027t think I said eight words. \n Finally it was over and I hit the doors, heading for the gates and thestupid Mission and my pointless house. \n I was barely out the gate when someone crashed into me. He was ayoung homeless guy, maybe my age, maybe a little older. He wore along, greasy overcoat, a pair of baggy jeans, and rotting sneakers thatlooked like they\u0027d been through a wood-chipper. His long hair hungover his face, and he had a pubic beard that straggled down his throat in-to the collar of a no-color knit sweater. \n I took this all in as we lay next to each other on the sidewalk, peoplepassing us and giving us weird looks. It seemed that he\u0027d crashed intome while hurrying down Valencia, bent over with the burden of a splitbackpack that lay beside him on the pavement, covered in tight geomet-ric doodles in magic-marker. \n He got to his knees and rocked back and forth, like he was drunk orhad hit his head. \n \"Sorry buddy,\" he said. \"Didn\u0027t see you. You hurt?\"I sat up too. Nothing felt hurt. \n \"Um. No, it\u0027s OK.\"He stood up and smiled. His teeth were shockingly white and straight,like an ad for an orthodontic clinic. He held his hand out to me and hisgrip was strong and firm. \n \"I\u0027m really sorry.\" His voice was also clear and intelligent. I\u0027d expectedhim to sound like the drunks who talked to themselves as they roamedthe Mission late at night, but he sounded like a knowledgeable bookstoreclerk. \n \"It\u0027s no problem,\" I said. \n He stuck out his hand again. \n \"Zeb,\" he said. \n \"Marcus,\" I said. \n \"A pleasure, Marcus,\" he said. \"Hope to run into you again sometime!\"206Laughing, he picked up his backpack, turned on his heel and hurriedaway. \n I walked the rest of the way home in a bemused fug. Mom was at thekitchen table and we had a little chat about nothing at all, the way weused to do, before everything changed. \n I took the stairs up to my room and flopped down in my chair. Foronce, I didn\u0027t want to login to the Xnet. I\u0027d checked in that morning be-fore school to discover that my note had created a gigantic controversyamong people who agreed with me and people who were righteouslypissed that I was telling them to back off from their beloved sport. \n I had three thousand projects I\u0027d been in the middle of when it had allstarted. I was building a pinhole camera out of legos, I\u0027d been playingwith aerial kite photography using an old digital camera with a triggerhacked out of silly putty that was stretched out at launch and slowlysnapped back to its original shape, triggering the shutter at regular inter-vals. I had a vacuum tube amp I\u0027d been building into an ancient, rusted,dented olive-oil tin that looked like an archaeological find — once it wasdone, I\u0027d planned to build in a dock for my phone and a set of 5.1surround-sound speakers out of tuna-fish cans. \n I looked over my workbench and finally picked up the pinhole cam-era. Methodically snapping legos together was just about my speed. \n I took off my watch and the chunky silver two-finger ring that showeda monkey and a ninja squaring off to fight and dropped them into thelittle box I used for all the crap I load into my pockets and around myneck before stepping out for the day: phone, wallet, keys, wifinder,change, batteries, retractable cables… I dumped it all out into the box,and found myself holding something I didn\u0027t remember putting in therein the first place. \n It was a piece of paper, grey and soft as flannel, furry at the edgeswhere it had been torn away from some larger piece of paper. It wascovered in the tiniest, most careful handwriting I\u0027d ever seen. I unfoldedit and held it up. The writing covered both sides, running down from thetop left corner of one side to a crabbed signature at the bottom rightcorner of the other side. \n The signature read, simply: ZEB. \n I picked it up and started to read. \n \u003e \n 207Dear Marcus\u003e \n You don\u0027t know me but I know you. For the past three months, sincethe Bay Bridge was blown up, I have been imprisoned on Treasure Is-land. I was in the yard on the day you talked to that Asian girl and gottackled. You were brave. Good on you. \n \u003e \n I had a burst appendix the day afterward and ended up in the infirm-ary. In the next bed was a guy named Darryl. We were both in recoveryfor a long time and by the time we got well, we were too much of an em-barrassment to them to let go. \n \u003e \n So they decided we must really be guilty. They questioned us everyday. You\u0027ve been through their questioning, I know. Imagine it formonths. Darryl and I ended up cell-mates. We knew we were bugged, sowe only talked about inconsequentialities. But at night, when we were inour cots, we would softly tap out messages to each other in Morse code(I knew my HAM radio days would come in useful sometime). \n \u003e \n At first, their questions to us were just the same crap as ever, who didit, how\u0027d they do it. But after a little while, they switched to asking usabout the Xnet. Of course, we\u0027d never heard of it. That didn\u0027t stop themasking. \n \u003e \n Darryl told me that they brought him arphid cloners, Xboxes, all kindsof technology and demanded that he tell them who used them, wherethey learned to mod them. Darryl told me about your games and thethings you learned. \n \u003e \n Especially: The DHS asked us about our friends. Who did we know? \n What were they like? Did they have political feelings? Had they been introuble at school? With the law? \n \u003e \n We call the prison Gitmo-by-the-Bay. It\u0027s been a week since I got outand I don\u0027t think that anyone knows that their sons and daughters areimprisoned in the middle of the Bay. At night we could hear peoplelaughing and partying on the mainland. \n 208\u003e \n I got out last week. I won\u0027t tell you how, in case this falls into thewrong hands. Maybe others will take my route. \n \u003e \n Darryl told me how to find you and made me promise to tell you whatI knew when I got back. Now that I\u0027ve done that I\u0027m out of here like lastyear. One way or another, I\u0027m leaving this country. Screw America. \n \u003e \n Stay strong. They\u0027re scared of you. Kick them for me. Don\u0027t get caught. \n \u003e \n ZebThere were tears in my eyes as I finished the note. I had a disposablelighter somewhere on my desk that I sometimes used to melt the insula-tion off of wires, and I dug it out and held it to the note. I knew I owed itto Zeb to destroy it and make sure no one else ever saw it, in case itmight lead them back to him, wherever he was going. \n I held the flame and the note, but I couldn\u0027t do it. \n Darryl. \n With all the crap with the Xnet and Ange and the DHS, I\u0027d almost for-gotten he existed. He\u0027d become a ghost, like an old friend who\u0027d movedaway or gone on an exchange program. All that time, they\u0027d been ques-tioning him, demanding that he rat me out, explain the Xnet, the jam-mers. He\u0027d been on Treasure Island, the abandoned military base thatwas halfway along the demolished span of the Bay Bridge. He\u0027d been soclose I could have swam to him. \n I put the lighter down and re-read the note. By the time it was done, Iwas weeping, sobbing. It all came back to me, the lady with the severehaircut and the questions she\u0027d asked and the reek of piss and the stiff-ness of my pants as the urine dried them into coarse canvas. \n \"Marcus?\"My door was ajar and my mother was standing in it, watching mewith a worried look. How long had she been there? \n I armed the tears away from my face and snorted up the snot. \"Mom,\"I said. \"Hi.\"She came into my room and hugged me. \"What is it? Do you need totalk?\"209The note lay on the table. \n \"Is that from your girlfriend? Is everything all right?\"She\u0027d given me an out. I could just blame it all on problems with Angeand she\u0027d leave my room and leave me alone. I opened my mouth to dojust that, and then this came out: \n \"I was in jail. After the bridge blew. I was in jail for that whole time.\"The sobs that came then didn\u0027t sound like my voice. They sounded likean animal noise, maybe a donkey or some kind of big cat noise in thenight. I sobbed so my throat burned and ached with it, so my chestheaved. \n Mom took me in her arms, the way she used to when I was a little boy,and she stroked my hair, and she murmured in my ear, and rocked me,and gradually, slowly, the sobs dissipated. \n I took a deep breath and Mom got me a glass of water. I sat on theedge of my bed and she sat in my desk chair and I told her everything. \n Everything. \n Well, most of it. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1848/53601.html","bookId":973,"book":{"id":973,"title":"Little Brother","description":"简介： I wrote Little Brother in a white-hot fury between May 7, 2007 and July 2,2007: exactly eight weeks from the day I thought it up to the day I fin-ished it (Alice, to whom this book is dedicated, had to put up with meclacking out the final chapter at...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/15-16-33-94-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1848","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:05 AM"}}
