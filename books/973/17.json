{"id":22151,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"This chapter is dedicated to San Francisco\u0027s Booksmith, ensconced in thestoried Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, just a few doors down from theBen and Jerry\u0027s at the exact corner of Haight and Ashbury. The Book-smith folks really know how to run an author event — when I lived inSan Francisco, I used to go down all the time to hear incredible writersspeak (William Gibson was unforgettable). They also produce littlebaseball-card-style trading cards for each author — I have two from myown appearances there. Booksmith: 1644 Haight St. San Francisco CA 94117 USA +1 415 8638688At first Mom looked shocked, then outraged, and finally she gave upaltogether and just let her jaw hang open as I took her through the inter-rogation, pissing myself, the bag over my head, Darryl. I showed her thenote. \"Why —?\"In that single syllable, every recrimination I\u0027d dealt myself in the night,every moment that I\u0027d lacked the bravery to tell the world what it wasreally about, why I was really fighting, what had really inspired theXnet. I sucked in a breath. \"They told me I\u0027d go to jail if I talked about it. Not just for a few days. Forever. I was — I was scared.\"Mom sat with me for a long time, not saying anything. Then, \"Whatabout Darryl\u0027s father?\"She might as well have stuck a knitting needle in my chest. Darryl\u0027sfather. He must have assumed that Darryl was dead, long dead. And wasn\u0027t he? After the DHS has held you illegally for three months,would they ever let you go? 211But Zeb got out. Maybe Darryl would get out. Maybe me and the Xnetcould help get Darryl out. \"I haven\u0027t told him,\" I said. Now Mom was crying. She didn\u0027t cry easily. It was a British thing. Itmade her little hiccoughing sobs much worse to hear. \"You will tell him,\" she managed. \"You will.\"\"I will.\"\"But first we have to tell your father.\"Dad no longer had any regular time when he came home. Between hisconsulting clients — who had lots of work now that the DHS was shop-ping for data-mining startups on the peninsula — and the long commuteto Berkeley, he might get home any time between 6PM and midnight. Tonight Mom called him and told him he was coming home right now. He said something and she just repeated it: right now. When he got there, we had arranged ourselves in the living room withthe note between us on the coffee table. It was easier to tell, the second time. The secret was getting lighter. Ididn\u0027t embellish, I didn\u0027t hide anything. I came clean. I\u0027d heard of coming clean before but I\u0027d never understood what itmeant until I did it. Holding in the secret had dirtied me, soiled my spir-it. It had made me afraid and ashamed. It had made me into all thethings that Ange said I was. Dad sat stiff as a ramrod the whole time, his face carved of stone. When I handed him the note, he read it twice and then set it downcarefully. He shook his head and stood up and headed for the front door. \"Where are you going?\" Mom asked, alarmed. \"I need a walk,\" was all he managed to gasp, his voice breaking. We stared awkwardly at each other, Mom and me, and waited for himto come home. I tried to imagine what was going on in his head. He\u0027dbeen such a different man after the bombings and I knew from Mom thatwhat had changed him were the days of thinking I was dead. He\u0027d cometo believe that the terrorists had nearly killed his son and it had madehim crazy. 212Crazy enough to do whatever the DHS asked, to line up like a goodlittle sheep and let them control him, drive him. Now he knew that it was the DHS that had imprisoned me, the DHSthat had taken San Francisco\u0027s children hostage in Gitmo-by-the-Bay. Itmade perfect sense, now that I thought of it. Of course it had been Treas-ure Island where I\u0027d been kept. Where else was a ten-minute boat-ridefrom San Francisco? When Dad came back, he looked angrier than he ever had in his life. \"You should have told me!\" he roared. Mom interposed herself between him and me. \"You\u0027re blaming thewrong person,\" she said. \"It wasn\u0027t Marcus who did the kidnapping andthe intimidation.\"He shook his head and stamped. \"I\u0027m not blaming Marcus. I know ex-actly who\u0027s to blame. Me. Me and the stupid DHS. Get your shoes on,grab your coats.\"\"Where are we going?\"\"To see Darryl\u0027s father. Then we\u0027re going to Barbara Stratford\u0027s place.\"I knew the name Barbara Stratford from somewhere, but I couldn\u0027t re-member where. I thought that maybe she was an old friend of my par-ents, but I couldn\u0027t exactly place her. Meantime, I was headed for Darryl\u0027s father\u0027s place. I\u0027d never really feltcomfortable around the old man, who\u0027d been a Navy radio operator andran his household like a tight ship. He\u0027d taught Darryl Morse code whenhe was a kid, which I\u0027d always thought was cool. It was one of the ways Iknew that I could trust Zeb\u0027s letter. But for every cool thing like Morsecode, Darryl\u0027s father had some crazy military discipline that seemed tobe for its own sake, like insisting on hospital corners on the beds andshaving twice a day. It drove Darryl up the wall. Darryl\u0027s mother hadn\u0027t liked it much either, and had taken off back toher family in Minnesota when Darryl was ten — Darryl spent his sum-mers and Christmases there. I was sitting in the back of the car, and I could see the back of Dad\u0027shead as he drove. The muscles in his neck were tense and kept jumpingaround as he ground his jaws. 213Mom kept her hand on his arm, but no one was around to comfort me. If only I could call Ange. Or Jolu. Or Van. Maybe I would when the daywas done. \"He must have buried his son in his mind,\" Dad said, as we whippedup through the hairpin curves leading up Twin Peaks to the little cottagethat Darryl and his father shared. The fog was on Twin Peaks, the way itoften was at night in San Francisco, making the headlamps reflect backon is. Each time we swung around a corner, I saw the valleys of the citylaid out below us, bowls of twinkling lights that shifted in the mist. \"Is this the one?\"\"Yes,\" I said. \"This is it.\" I hadn\u0027t been to Darryl\u0027s in months, but I\u0027dspent enough time here over the years to recognize it right off. The three of us stood around the car for a long moment, waiting to seewho would go and ring the doorbell. To my surprise, it was me. I rang it and we all waited in held-breath silence for a minute. I rang itagain. Darryl\u0027s father\u0027s car was in the driveway, and we\u0027d seen a lightburning in the living room. I was about to ring a third time when thedoor opened. \"Marcus?\" Darryl\u0027s father wasn\u0027t anything like I remembered him. Un-shaven, in a housecoat and bare feet, with long toenails and red eyes. He\u0027d gained weight, and a soft extra chin wobbled beneath the firm mil-itary jaw. His thin hair was wispy and disordered. \"Mr Glover,\" I said. My parents crowded into the door behind me. \"Hello, Ron,\" my mother said. \"Ron,\" my father said. \"You too? What\u0027s going on?\"\"Can we come in?\"His living room looked like one of those news-segments they showabout abandoned kids who spend a month locked in before they\u0027re res-cued by the neighbors: frozen meal boxes, empty beer cans and juicebottles, moldy cereal bowls and piles of newspapers. There was a reek ofcat piss and litter crunched underneath our feet. Even without the catpiss, the smell was incredible, like a bus-station toilet. The couch was made up with a grimy sheet and a couple of greasy pil-lows and the cushions had a dented, much-slept-upon look. 214We all stood there for a long silent moment, embarrassment over-whelming every other emotion. Darryl\u0027s father looked like he wanted todie. Slowly, he moved aside the sheets from the sofa and cleared thestacked, greasy food-trays off of a couple of the chairs, carrying them in-to the kitchen, and, from the sound of it, tossing them on the floor. We sat gingerly in the places he\u0027d cleared, and then he came back andsat down too. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said vaguely. \"I don\u0027t really have any coffee to offeryou. I\u0027m having more groceries delivered tomorrow so I\u0027m running low—\"\"Ron,\" my father said. \"Listen to us. We have something to tell you,and it\u0027s not going to be easy to hear.\"He sat like a statue as I talked. He glanced down at the note, read itwithout seeming to understand it, then read it again. He handed it backto me. He was trembling. \"He\u0027s —\"\"Darryl is alive,\" I said. \"Darryl is alive and being held prisoner onTreasure Island.\"He stuffed his fist in his mouth and made a horrible groaning sound. \"We have a friend,\" my father said. \"She writes for the Bay Guardian. An investigative reporter.\"That\u0027s where I knew the name from. The free weekly Guardian oftenlost its reporters to bigger daily papers and the Internet, but BarbaraStratford had been there forever. I had a dim memory of having dinnerwith her when I was a kid. \"We\u0027re going there now,\" my mother said. \"Will you come with us,Ron? Will you tell her Darryl\u0027s story?\"He put his face in his hands and breathed deeply. Dad tried to put hishand on his shoulders, but Mr Glover shook it off violently. \"I need to clean myself up,\" he said. \"Give me a minute.\"Mr Glover came back downstairs a changed man. He\u0027d shaved andgelled his hair back, and had put on a crisp military dress uniform with arow of campaign ribbons on the breast. He stopped at the foot of thestairs and kind of gestured at it. 215\"I don\u0027t have much clean stuff that\u0027s presentable at the moment. Andthis seemed appropriate. You know, if she wanted to take pictures.\"He and Dad rode up front and I got in the back, behind him. Up close,he smelled a little of beer, like it was coming through his pores. It was midnight by the time we rolled into Barbara Stratford\u0027s drive-way. She lived out of town, down in Mountain View, and as we speddown the 101, none of us said a word. The high-tech buildings alongsidethe highway streamed past us. This was a different Bay Area to the one I lived in, more like the sub-urban America I sometimes saw on TV. Lots of freeways and subdivi-sions of identical houses, towns where there weren\u0027t any homelesspeople pushing shopping carts down the sidewalk — there weren\u0027t evensidewalks! Mom had phoned Barbara Stratford while we were waiting for MrGlover to come downstairs. The journalist had been sleeping, but Momhad been so wound up she forgot to be all British and embarrassed aboutwaking her up. Instead, she just told her, tensely, that she had somethingto talk about and that it had to be in person. When we rolled up to Barbara Stratford\u0027s house, my first thought wasof the Brady Bunch place — a low ranch house with a brick baffle infront of it and a neat, perfectly square lawn. There was a kind of abstracttile pattern on the baffle, and an old-fashioned UHF TV antenna risingfrom behind it. We wandered around to the entrance and saw that therewere lights on inside already. The writer opened the door before we had a chance to ring the bell. She was about my parents\u0027 age, a tall thin woman with a hawk-like noseand shrewd eyes with a lot of laugh-lines. She was wearing a pair ofjeans that were hip enough to be seen at one of the boutiques on ValenciaStreet, and a loose Indian cotton blouse that hung down to her thighs. She had small round glasses that flashed in her hallway light. She smiled a tight little smile at us. \"You brought the whole clan, I see,\" she said. Mom nodded. \"You\u0027ll understand why in a minute,\" she said. MrGlover stepped from behind Dad. \"And you called in the Navy?\"\"All in good time.\"216We were introduced one at a time to her. She had a firm handshakeand long fingers. Her place was furnished in Japanese minimalist style, just a few pre-cisely proportioned, low pieces of furniture, large clay pots of bamboothat brushed the ceiling, and what looked like a large, rusted piece of adiesel engine perched on top of a polished marble plinth. I decided Iliked it. The floors were old wood, sanded and stained, but not filled, soyou could see cracks and pits underneath the varnish. I really liked that,especially as I walked over it in my stocking feet. \"I have coffee on,\" she said. \"Who wants some?\"We all put up our hands. I glared defiantly at my parents. \"Right,\" she said. She disappeared into another room and came back a moment laterbearing a rough bamboo tray with a half-gallon thermos jug and six cupsof precise design but with rough, sloppy decorations. I liked those too. \"Now,\" she said, once she\u0027d poured and served. \"It\u0027s very good to seeyou all again. Marcus, I think the last time I saw you, you were maybeseven years old. As I recall, you were very excited about your new videogames, which you showed me.\"I didn\u0027t remember it at all, but that sounded like what I\u0027d been into atseven. I guessed it was my Sega Dreamcast. She produced a tape-recorder and a yellow pad and a pen, and twirledthe pen. \"I\u0027m here to listen to whatever you tell me, and I can promiseyou that I\u0027ll take it all in confidence. But I can\u0027t promise that I\u0027ll do any-thing with it, or that it\u0027s going to get published.\" The way she said itmade me realize that my Mom had called in a pretty big favor gettingthis lady out of bed, friend or no friend. It must be kind of a pain in theass to be a big-shot investigative reporter. There were probably a millionpeople who would have liked her to take up her cause. Mom nodded at me. Even though I\u0027d told the story three times thatnight, I found myself tongue-tied. This was different from telling myparents. Different from telling Darryl\u0027s father. This — this would start anew move in the game. I started slowly, and watched Barbara take notes. I drank a whole cupof coffee just explaining what ARGing was and how I got out of school toplay. Mom and Dad and Mr Glover all listened intently to this part. Ipoured myself another cup and drank it on the way to explaining how217we were taken in. By the time I\u0027d run through the whole story, I\u0027ddrained the pot and I needed a piss like a race-horse. Her bathroom was just as stark as the living-room, with a brown, or-ganic soap that smelled like clean mud. I came back in and found theadults quietly watching me. Mr Glover told his story next. He didn\u0027t have anything to say aboutwhat had happened, but he explained that he was a veteran and that hisson was a good kid. He talked about what it felt like to believe that hisson had died, about how his ex-wife had had a collapse when she foundout and ended up in a hospital. He cried a little, unashamed, the tearsstreaming down his lined face and darkening the collar of his dress-uniform. When it was all done, Barbara went into a different room and cameback with a bottle of Irish whiskey. \"It\u0027s a Bushmills 15 year old rum-caskaged blend,\" she said, setting down four small cups. None for me. \"Ithasn\u0027t been sold in ten years. I think this is probably an appropriate timeto break it out.\"She poured them each a small glass of the liquor, then raised hers andsipped at it, draining half the glass. The rest of the adults followed suit. They drank again, and finished the glasses. She poured them new shots. \"All right,\" she said. \"Here\u0027s what I can tell you right now. I believeyou. Not just because I know you, Lillian. The story sounds right, and itties in with other rumors I\u0027ve heard. But I\u0027m not going to be able to justtake your word for it. I\u0027m going to have to investigate every aspect ofthis, and every element of your lives and stories. I need to know if there\u0027sanything you\u0027re not telling me, anything that could be used to discredityou after this comes to light. I need everything. It could take weeks be-fore I\u0027m ready to publish. \"You also need to think about your safety and this Darryl\u0027s safety. Ifhe\u0027s really an \u0027un-person\u0027 then bringing pressure to bear on the DHScould cause them to move him somewhere much further away. ThinkSyria. They could also do something much worse.\" She let that hang inthe air. I knew she meant that they might kill him. \"I\u0027m going to take this letter and scan it now. I want pictures of the twoof you, now and later — we can send out a photographer, but I want todocument this as thoroughly as I can tonight, too.\"I went with her into her office to do the scan. I\u0027d expected a stylish,low-powered computer that fit in with her decor, but instead, her spare-218bedroom/office was crammed with top-of-the-line PCs, big flat-panelmonitors, and a scanner big enough to lay a whole sheet of newsprint on. She was fast with it all, too. I noted with some approval that she wasrunning ParanoidLinux. This lady took her job seriously. The computers\u0027 fans set up an effective white-noise shield, but even so,I closed the door and moved in close to her. \"Um, Barbara?\"\"Yes?\"\"About what you said, about what might be used to discredit me?\"\"Yes?\"\"What I tell you, you can\u0027t be forced to tell anyone else, right?\"\"In theory. Let me put it this way. I\u0027ve gone to jail twice rather than ratout a source.\"\"OK, OK. Good. Wow. Jail. Wow. OK.\" I took a deep breath. \"You\u0027veheard of Xnet? Of M1k3y?\"\"Yes?\"\"I\u0027m M1k3y.\"\"Oh,\" she said. She worked the scanner and flipped the note over toget the reverse. She was scanning at some unbelievable resolution, 10,000dots per inch or higher, and on-screen it was like the output of anelectron-tunneling microscope. \"Well, that does put a different complexion on this.\"\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I guess it does.\"\"Your parents don\u0027t know.\"\"Nope. And I don\u0027t know if I want them to.\"\"That\u0027s something you\u0027re going to have to work out. I need to thinkabout this. Can you come by my office? I\u0027d like to talk to you about whatthis means, exactly.\"\"Do you have an Xbox Universal? I could bring over an installer.\"\"Yes, I\u0027m sure that can be arranged. When you come by, tell the recep-tionist that you\u0027re Mr Brown, to see me. They know what that means. Nonote will be taken of you coming, and all the security camera footage forthe day will be automatically scrubbed and the cameras deactivated untilyou leave.\"\"Wow,\" I said. \"You think like I do.\"219She smiled and socked me in the shoulder. \"Kiddo, I\u0027ve been at thisgame for a hell of a long time. So far, I\u0027ve managed to spend more timefree than behind bars. Paranoia is my friend.\"I was like a zombie the next day in school. I\u0027d totaled about threehours of sleep, and even three cups of the Turk\u0027s caffeine mud failed tojump-start my brain. The problem with caffeine is that it\u0027s too easy to getacclimated to it, so you have to take higher and higher doses just to getabove normal. I\u0027d spent the night thinking over what I had to do. It was like runninthough a maze of twisty little passages, all alike, every one leading to thesame dead end. When I went to Barbara, it would be over for me. Thatwas the outcome, no matter how I thought about it. By the time the school day was over, all I wanted was to go home andcrawl into bed. But I had an appointment at the Bay Guardian, down onthe waterfront. I kept my eyes on my feet as I wobbled out the gate, andas I turned into 24th Street, another pair of feet fell into step with me. Irecognized the shoes and stopped. \"Ange?\"She looked like I felt. Sleep-deprived and raccoon-eyed, with sadbrackets in the corners of her mouth. \"Hi there,\" she said. \"Surprise. I gave myself French Leave from school. I couldn\u0027t concentrate anyway.\"\"Um,\" I said. \"Shut up and give me a hug, you idiot.\"I did. It felt good. Better than good. It felt like I\u0027d amputated part ofmyself and it had been reattached. \"I love you, Marcus Yallow.\"\"I love you, Angela Carvelli.\"\"OK,\" she said breaking it off. \"I liked your post about why you\u0027re notjamming. I can respect it. What have you done about finding a way tojam them without getting caught?\"\"I\u0027m on my way to meet an investigative journalist who\u0027s going to pub-lish a story about how I got sent to jail, how I started Xnet, and howDarryl is being illegally held by the DHS at a secret prison on TreasureIsland.\"220\"Oh.\" She looked around for a moment. \"Couldn\u0027t you think of any-thing, you know, ambitious?\"\"Want to come?\"\"I am coming, yes. And I would like you to explain this in detail if youdon\u0027t mind.\"After all the re-tellings, this one, told as we walked to Potrero Avenueand down to 15th Street, was the easiest. She held my hand andsqueezed it often. We took the stairs up to the Bay Guardian\u0027s offices two at a time. Myheart was pounding. I got to the reception desk and told the bored girlbehind it, \"I\u0027m here to see Barbara Stratford. My name is Mr Green.\"\"I think you mean Mr Brown?\"\"Yeah,\" I said, and blushed. \"Mr Brown.\"She did something at her computer, then said, \"Have a seat. Barbarawill be out in a minute. Can I get you anything?\"\"Coffee,\" we both said in unison. Another reason to love Ange: wewere addicted to the same drug. The receptionist — a pretty latina woman only a few years older thanus, dressed in Gap styles so old they were actually kind of hipster-retro— nodded and stepped out and came back with a couple of cups bearingthe newspaper\u0027s masthead. We sipped in silence, watching visitors and reporters come and go. Finally, Barbara came to get us. She was wearing practically the samething as the night before. It suited her. She quirked an eyebrow at mewhen she saw that I\u0027d brought a date. \"Hello,\" I said. \"Um, this is —\"\"Ms Brown,\" Ange said, extending a hand. Oh, yeah, right, our identit-ies were supposed to be a secret. \"I work with Mr Green.\" She elbowedme lightly. \"Let\u0027s go then,\" Barbara said, and led us back to a board-room withlong glass walls with their blinds drawn shut. She set down a tray ofWhole Foods organic Oreo clones, a digital recorder, and another yellowpad. \"Do you want to record this too?\" she asked. Hadn\u0027t actually thought of that. I could see why it would be useful if Iwanted to dispute what Barbara printed, though. Still, if I couldn\u0027t trusther to do right by me, I was doomed anyway. 221\"No, that\u0027s OK,\" I said. \"Right, let\u0027s go. Young lady, my name is Barbara Stratford and I\u0027m aninvestigative reporter. I gather you know why I\u0027m here, and I\u0027m curiousto know why you\u0027re here.\"\"I work with Marcus on the Xnet,\" she said. \"Do you need to know myname?\"\"Not right now, I don\u0027t,\" Barbara said. \"You can be anonymous if you\u0027dlike. Marcus, I asked you to tell me this story because I need to knowhow it plays with the story you told me about your friend Darryl and thenote you showed me. I can see how it would be a good adjunct; I couldpitch this as the origin of the Xnet. \u0027They made an enemy they\u0027ll neverforget,\u0027 that sort of thing. But to be honest, I\u0027d rather not have to tell thatstory if I don\u0027t have to. \"I\u0027d rather have a nice clean tale about the secret prison on our door-step, without having to argue about whether the prisoners there are thesort of people likely to walk out the doors and establish an undergroundmovement bent on destabilizing the federal government. I\u0027m sure youcan understand that.\"I did. If the Xnet was part of the story, some people would say, see,they need to put guys like that in jail or they\u0027ll start a riot. \"This is your show,\" I said. \"I think you need to tell the world aboutDarryl. When you do that, it\u0027s going to tell the DHS that I\u0027ve gone publicand they\u0027re going to go after me. Maybe they\u0027ll figure out then that I\u0027minvolved with the Xnet. Maybe they\u0027ll connect me to M1k3y. I guesswhat I\u0027m saying is, once you publish about Darryl, it\u0027s all over for me nomatter what. I\u0027ve made my peace with that.\"\"As good be hanged for a sheep as a lamb,\" she said. \"Right. Well,that\u0027s settled. I want the two of you to tell me everything you can aboutthe founding and operation of the Xnet, and then I want a demonstra-tion. What do you use it for? Who else uses it? How did it spread? Whowrote the software? Everything.\"\"This\u0027ll take a while,\" Ange said. \"I\u0027ve got a while,\" Barbara said. She drank some coffee and ate a fakeOreo. \"This could be the most important story of the War on Terror. Thiscould be the story that topples the government. When you have a storylike this, you take it very carefully.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1848/53602.html","bookId":973,"book":{"id":973,"title":"Little Brother","description":"简介： I wrote Little Brother in a white-hot fury between May 7, 2007 and July 2,2007: exactly eight weeks from the day I thought it up to the day I fin-ished it (Alice, to whom this book is dedicated, had to put up with meclacking out the final chapter at...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/15-16-33-94-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1848","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:05 AM"}}
