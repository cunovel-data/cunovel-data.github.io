{"id":22143,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"This chapter is dedicated to Borders, the global bookselling giant thatyou can find in cities all over the world — I\u0027ll never forget walking intothe gigantic Borders on Orchard Road in Singapore and discovering ashelf loaded with my novels! For many years, the Borders in OxfordStreet in London hosted Pat Cadigan\u0027s monthly science fiction evenings,where local and visiting authors would read their work, speak about sci-ence fiction and meet their fans. When I\u0027m in a strange city (which hap-pens a lot) and I need a great book for my next flight, there always seemsto be a Borders brimming with great choices — I\u0027m especially partial tothe Borders on union Square in San Francisco. \n Borders worldwideI wasn\u0027t the only one who got screwed up by the histograms. There arelots of people who have abnormal traffic patterns, abnormal usage pat-terns. Abnormal is so common, it\u0027s practically normal. \n The Xnet was full of these stories, and so were the newspapers and theTV news. Husbands were caught cheating on their wives; wives werecaught cheating on their husbands, kids were caught sneaking out withillicit girlfriends and boyfriends. A kid who hadn\u0027t told his parents hehad AIDS got caught going to the clinic for his drugs. \n Those were the people with something to hide — not guilty people,but people with secrets. There were even more people with nothing tohide at all, but who nevertheless resented being picked up, and ques-tioned. Imagine if someone locked you in the back of a police car and de-manded that you prove that you\u0027re not a terrorist. \n It wasn\u0027t just public transit. Most drivers in the Bay Area have aFasTrak pass clipped to their sun-visors. This is a little radio-based\"wallet\" that pays your tolls for you when you cross the bridges, savingyou the hassle of sitting in a line for hours at the toll-plazas. They\u0027dtripled the cost of using cash to get across the bridge (though they104always fudged this, saying that FasTrak was cheaper, not that anonym-ous cash was more expensive). Whatever holdouts were left afterwarddisappeared after the number of cash-lanes was reduced to just one perbridge-head, so that the cash lines were even longer. \n So if you\u0027re a local, or if you\u0027re driving a rental car from a local agency,you\u0027ve got a FasTrak. It turns out that toll-plazas aren\u0027t the only placethat your FasTrak gets read, though. The DHS had put FasTrak readersall over town — when you drove past them, they logged the time andyour ID number, building an ever-more perfect picture of who wentwhere, when, in a database that was augmented by \"speeding cameras,\"\"red light cameras\" and all the other license-plate cameras that hadpopped up like mushrooms. \n No one had given it much thought. And now that people were payingattention, we were all starting to notice little things, like the fact that theFasTrak doesn\u0027t have an off-switch. \n So if you drove a car, you were just as likely to be pulled over by anSFPD cruiser that wanted to know why you were taking so many trips tothe Home Depot lately, and what was that midnight drive up to Sonomalast week about? \n The little demonstrations around town on the weekend were growing. \n Fifty thousand people marched down Market Street after a week of thismonitoring. I couldn\u0027t care less. The people who\u0027d occupied my citydidn\u0027t care what the natives wanted. They were a conquering army. Theyknew how we felt about that. \n One morning I came down to breakfast just in time to hear Dad tellMom that the two biggest taxi companies were going to give a \"discount\"to people who used special cards to pay their fares, supposedly to makedrivers safer by reducing the amount of cash they carried. I wonderedwhat would happen to the information about who took which cabswhere. \n I realized how close I\u0027d come. The new indienet client had beenpushed out as an automatic update just as this stuff started to get bad,and Jolu told me that 80 percent of the traffic he saw at Pigspleen wasnow encrypted. The Xnet just might have been saved. \n Dad was driving me nuts, though. \n \"You\u0027re being paranoid, Marcus,\" he told me over breakfast one day asI told him about the guys I\u0027d seen the cops shaking down on BART theday before. \n 105\"Dad, it\u0027s ridiculous. They\u0027re not catching any terrorists, are they? It\u0027sjust making people scared.\"\"They may not have caught any terrorists yet, but they\u0027re sure gettinga lot of scumbags off the streets. Look at the drug dealers — it saysthey\u0027ve put dozens of them away since this all started. Remember whenthose druggies robbed you? If we don\u0027t bust their dealers, it\u0027ll only getworse.\" I\u0027d been mugged the year before. They\u0027d been pretty civilizedabout it. One skinny guy who smelled bad told me he had a gun, the oth-er one asked me for my wallet. They even let me keep my ID, thoughthey got my debit card and Fast Pass. It had still scared me witless andleft me paranoid and checking my shoulder for weeks. \n \"But most of the people they hold up aren\u0027t doing anything wrong,Dad,\" I said. This was getting to me. My own father! \"It\u0027s crazy. For everyguilty person they catch, they have to punish thousands of innocentpeople. That\u0027s just not good.\"\"Innocent? Guys cheating on their wives? Drug dealers? You\u0027re de-fending them, but what about all the people who died? If you don\u0027t haveanything to hide —\"\"So you wouldn\u0027t mind if they pulled you over?\" My dad\u0027s histogramshad proven to be depressingly normal so far. \n \"I\u0027d consider it my duty,\" he said. \"I\u0027d be proud. It would make me feelsafer.\"Easy for him to say. \n Vanessa didn\u0027t like me talking about this stuff, but she was too smartabout it for me to stay away from the subject for long. We\u0027d get togetherall the time, and talk about the weather and school and stuff, and then,somehow, I\u0027d be back on this subject. Vanessa was cool when ithappened — she didn\u0027t Hulk out on me again — but I could see it upsether. \n Still. \n \"So my dad says, \u0027I\u0027d consider it my duty.\u0027 Can you freaking believe it? Imean, God! I almost told him then about going to jail, asking him if hethought that was our \u0027duty\u0027!\"We were sitting in the grass in Dolores Park after school, watching thedogs chase frisbees. \n 106Van had stopped at home and changed into an old t-shirt for one ofher favorite Brazilian tecno-brega bands, Carioca Proibid?o — the forbid-den guy from Rio. She\u0027d gotten the shirt at a live show we\u0027d all gone totwo years before, sneaking out for a grand adventure down at the CowPalace, and she\u0027d sprouted an inch or two since, so it was tight and rodeup her tummy, showing her flat little belly button. \n She lay back in the weak sun with her eyes closed behind her shades,her toes wiggling in her flip-flops. I\u0027d known Van since forever, andwhen I thought of her, I usually saw the little kid I\u0027d known with hun-dreds of jangly bracelets made out of sliced-up soda cans, who playedthe piano and couldn\u0027t dance to save her life. Sitting out there in DoloresPark, I suddenly saw her as she was. \n She was totally h4wt — that is to say, hot. It was like looking at thatpicture of a vase and noticing that it was also two faces. I could see thatVan was just Van, but I could also see that she was hella pretty,something I\u0027d never noticed. \n Of course, Darryl had known it all along, and don\u0027t think that I wasn\u0027tbummed out anew when I realized this. \n \"You can\u0027t tell your dad, you know,\" she said. \"You\u0027d put us all at risk.\"Her eyes were closed and her chest was rising up and down with herbreath, which was distracting in a really embarrassing way. \n \"Yeah,\" I said, glumly. \"But the problem is that I know he\u0027s just totallyfull of it. If you pulled my dad over and made him prove he wasn\u0027t achild-molesting, drug-dealing terrorist, he\u0027d go berserk. Totally off-the-rails. He hates being put on hold when he calls about his credit-card bill. \n Being locked in the back of a car and questioned for an hour would givehim an aneurism.\"\"They only get away with it because the normals feel smug comparedto the abnormals. If everyone was getting pulled over, it\u0027d be a disaster. \n No one would ever get anywhere, they\u0027d all be waiting to get questionedby the cops. Total gridlock.\"Woah. \n \"Van, you are a total genius,\" I said. \n \"Tell me about it,\" she said. She had a lazy smile and she looked at methrough half-lidded eyes, almost romantic. \n \"Seriously. We can do this. We can mess up the profiles easily. Gettingpeople pulled over is easy.\"107She sat up and pushed her hair off her face and looked at me. I felt alittle flip in my stomach, thinking that she was really impressed with me. \n \"It\u0027s the arphid cloners,\" I said. \"They\u0027re totally easy to make. Just flashthe firmware on a ten-dollar Radio Shack reader/writer and you\u0027re done. \n What we do is go around and randomly swap the tags on people, over-writing their Fast Passes and FasTraks with other people\u0027s codes. That\u0027llmake everyone skew all weird and screwy, and make everyone lookguilty. Then: total gridlock.\"Van pursed her lips and lowered her shades and I realized she was soangry she couldn\u0027t speak. \n \"Good bye, Marcus,\" she said, and got to her feet. Before I knew it, shewas walking away so fast she was practically running. \n \"Van!\" I called, getting to my feet and chasing after her. \"Van! Wait!\"She picked up speed, making me run to catch up with her. \n \"Van, what the hell,\" I said, catching her arm. She jerked it away sohard I punched myself in the face. \n \"You\u0027re psycho, Marcus. You\u0027re going to put all your little Xnet bud-dies in danger for their lives, and on top of it, you\u0027re going to turn thewhole city into terrorism suspects. Can\u0027t you stop before you hurt thesepeople?\"I opened and closed my mouth a couple times. \"Van, I\u0027m not the prob-lem, they are. I\u0027m not arresting people, jailing them, making them disap-pear. The Department of Homeland Security are the ones doing that. I\u0027mfighting back to make them stop.\"\"How, by making it worse?\"\"Maybe it has to get worse to get better, Van. Isn\u0027t that what you weresaying? If everyone was getting pulled over —\"\"That\u0027s not what I meant. I didn\u0027t mean you should get everyone arres-ted. If you want to protest, join the protest movement. Do somethingpositive. Didn\u0027t you learn anything from Darryl? Anything?\"\"You\u0027re damned right I did,\" I said, losing my cool. \"I learned that theycan\u0027t be trusted. That if you\u0027re not fighting them, you\u0027re helping them. \n That they\u0027ll turn the country into a prison if we let them. What did youlearn, Van? To be scared all the time, to sit tight and keep your headdown and hope you don\u0027t get noticed? You think it\u0027s going to get better? \n If we don\u0027t do anything, this is as good as it\u0027s going to get. It will only get108worse and worse from now on. You want to help Darryl? Help me bringthem down!\"There it was again. My vow. Not to get Darryl free, but to bring downthe entire DHS. That was crazy, even I knew it. But it was what I plannedto do. No question about it. \n Van shoved me hard with both hands. She was strong from school ath-letics — fencing, lacrosse, field hockey, all the girls-school sports — and Iended up on my ass on the disgusting San Francisco sidewalk. She tookoff and I didn\u0027t follow. \n \u003e \n The important thing about security systems isn\u0027t how they work, it\u0027show they fail. \n That was the first line of my first blog post on Open Revolt, my Xnetsite. I was writing as M1k3y, and I was ready to go to war. \n \u003e \n Maybe all the automatic screening is supposed to catch terrorists. \n Maybe it will catch a terrorist sooner or later. The problem is that itcatches us too, even though we\u0027re not doing anything wrong. \n \u003e \n The more people it catches, the more brittle it gets. If it catches toomany people, it dies. \n \u003e \n Get the idea? \n I pasted in my HOWTO for building a arphid cloner, and some tips forgetting close enough to people to read and write their tags. I put my owncloner in the pocket of my vintage black leather motocross jacket withthe armored pockets and left for school. I managed to clone six tagsbetween home and Chavez High. \n It was war they wanted. It was war they\u0027d get. \n If you ever decide to do something as stupid as build an automatic ter-rorism detector, here\u0027s a math lesson you need to learn first. It\u0027s called\"the paradox of the false positive,\" and it\u0027s a doozy. \n Say you have a new disease, called Super-AIDS. Only one in a millionpeople gets Super-AIDS. You develop a test for Super-AIDS that\u0027s 99109percent accurate. I mean, 99 percent of the time, it gives the correct result— true if the subject is infected, and false if the subject is healthy. Yougive the test to a million people. \n One in a million people have Super-AIDS. One in a hundred peoplethat you test will generate a \"false positive\" — the test will say he hasSuper-AIDS even though he doesn\u0027t. That\u0027s what \"99 percent accurate\"means: one percent wrong. \n What\u0027s one percent of one million? \n 1,000,000/100 \u003d 10,000One in a million people has Super-AIDS. If you test a million randompeople, you\u0027ll probably only find one case of real Super-AIDS. But yourtest won\u0027t identify one person as having Super-AIDS. It will identify10,000 people as having it. \n Your 99 percent accurate test will perform with 99.99 percentinaccuracy. \n That\u0027s the paradox of the false positive. When you try to findsomething really rare, your test\u0027s accuracy has to match the rarity of thething you\u0027re looking for. If you\u0027re trying to point at a single pixel on yourscreen, a sharp pencil is a good pointer: the pencil-tip is a lot smaller(more accurate) than the pixels. But a pencil-tip is no good at pointing ata single atom in your screen. For that, you need a pointer — a test —that\u0027s one atom wide or less at the tip. \n This is the paradox of the false positive, and here\u0027s how it applies toterrorism: \n Terrorists are really rare. In a city of twenty million like New York,there might be one or two terrorists. Maybe ten of them at the outside. \n 10/20,000,000 \u003d 0.00005 percent. One twenty-thousandth of a percent. \n That\u0027s pretty rare all right. Now, say you\u0027ve got some software that cansift through all the bank-records, or toll-pass records, or public transit re-cords, or phone-call records in the city and catch terrorists 99 percent ofthe time. \n In a pool of twenty million people, a 99 percent accurate test willidentify two hundred thousand people as being terrorists. But only ten ofthem are terrorists. To catch ten bad guys, you have to haul in and in-vestigate two hundred thousand innocent people. \n Guess what? Terrorism tests aren\u0027t anywhere close to 99 percent accur-ate. More like 60 percent accurate. Even 40 percent accurate, sometimes. \n 110What this all meant was that the Department of Homeland Securityhad set itself up to fail badly. They were trying to spot incredibly rareevents — a person is a terrorist — with inaccurate systems. \n Is it any wonder we were able to make such a mess? \n I stepped out the front door whistling on a Tuesday morning one weekinto the Operation False Positive. I was rockin\u0027 out to some new musicI\u0027d downloaded from the Xnet the night before — lots of people sentM1k3y little digital gifts to say thank you for giving them hope. \n I turned onto 23d Street and carefully took the narrow stone steps cutinto the side of the hill. As I descended, I passed Mr Wiener Dog. I don\u0027tknow Mr Wiener Dog\u0027s real name, but I see him nearly every day, walk-ing his three panting wiener dogs up the staircase to the little parkette. \n Squeezing past them all on the stairs is pretty much impossible and I al-ways end up tangled in a leash, knocked into someone\u0027s front garden, orperched on the bumper of one of the cars parked next to the curb. \n Mr Wiener Dog is clearly Someone Important, because he has a fancywatch and always wears a nice suit. I had mentally assumed that heworked down in the financial district. \n Today as I brushed up against him, I triggered my arphid cloner,which was already loaded in the pocket of my leather jacket. The clonersucked down the numbers off his credit-cards and his car-keys, his pass-port and the hundred-dollar bills in his wallet. \n Even as it was doing that, it was flashing some of them with new num-bers, taken from other people I\u0027d brushed against. It was like switchingthe license-plates on a bunch of cars, but invisible and instantaneous. Ismiled apologetically at Mr Wiener Dog and continued down the stairs. Istopped at three of the cars long enough to swap their FasTrak tags withnumbers taken offall over cars I\u0027d gone past the day before. \n You might think I was being a little aggro here, but I was cautious andconservative compared to a lot of the Xnetters. A couple girls in theChemical Engineering program at UC Berkeley had figured out how tomake a harmless substance out of kitchen products that would trip anexplosive sniffer. They\u0027d had a merry time sprinkling it on their profs\u0027 \n briefcases and jackets, then hiding out and watching the same profs tryto get into the auditoriums and libraries on campus, only to get flying-tackled by the new security squads that had sprung up everywhere. \n 111Other people wanted to figure out how to dust envelopes with sub-stances that would test positive for anthrax, but everyone else thoughtthey were out of their minds. Luckily, it didn\u0027t seem like they\u0027d be able tofigure it out. \n I passed by San Francisco General Hospital and nodded with satisfac-tion as I saw the huge lines at the front doors. They had a police check-point too, of course, and there were enough Xnetters working as internsand cafeteria workers and whatnot there that everyone\u0027s badges hadbeen snarled up and swapped around. I\u0027d read the security checks hadtacked an hour onto everyone\u0027s work day, and the unions were threaten-ing to walk out unless the hospital did something about it. \n A few blocks later, I saw an even longer line for the BART. Cops werewalking up and down the line pointing people out and calling themaside for questioning, bag-searches and pat-downs. They kept gettingsued for doing this, but it didn\u0027t seem to be slowing them down. \n I got to school a little ahead of time and decided to walk down to 22ndStreet to get a coffee — and I passed a police checkpoint where they werepulling over cars for secondary inspection. \n School was no less wild — the security guards on the metal detectorswere also wanding our school IDs and pulling out students with oddmovements for questioning. Needless to say, we all had pretty weirdmovements. Needless to say, classes were starting an hour or more later. \n Classes were crazy. I don\u0027t think anyone was able to concentrate. Ioverheard two teachers talking about how long it had taken them to gethome from work the day before, and planning to sneak out early thatday. \n It was all I could do to keep from laughing. The paradox of the falsepositive strikes again! \n Sure enough, they let us out of class early and I headed home the longway, circling through the Mission to see the havoc. Long lines of cars. \n BART stations lined up around the blocks. People swearing at ATMs thatwouldn\u0027t dispense their money because they\u0027d had their accounts frozenfor suspicious activity (that\u0027s the danger of wiring your checking accountstraight into your FasTrak and Fast Pass!). \n I got home and made myself a sandwich and logged into the Xnet. Ithad been a good day. People from all over town were crowing abouttheir successes. We\u0027d brought the city of San Francisco to a standstill. Thenews-reports confirmed it — they were calling it the DHS gone haywire,112blaming it all on the fake-ass \"security\" that was supposed to be protect-ing us from terrorism. The Business section of the San Francisco Chron-icle gave its whole front page to an estimate of the economic cost of theDHS security resulting from missed work hours, meetings and so on. Ac-cording to the Chronicle\u0027s economist, a week of this crap would cost thecity more than the Bay Bridge bombing had. \n Mwa-ha-ha-ha. \n The best part: Dad got home that night late. Very late. Three hours late. \n Why? Because he\u0027d been pulled over, searched, questioned. Then ithappened again. Twice. \n Twice! \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1848/53594.html","bookId":973,"book":{"id":973,"title":"Little Brother","description":"简介： I wrote Little Brother in a white-hot fury between May 7, 2007 and July 2,2007: exactly eight weeks from the day I thought it up to the day I fin-ished it (Alice, to whom this book is dedicated, had to put up with meclacking out the final chapter at...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/30/15-16-33-94-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1848","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:05 AM"}}
