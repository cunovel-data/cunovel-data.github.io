{"id":96732,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"30 THE FOLLOWING NIGHT we hunted down a pair of brigands who were traveling the lower passes of our mountains. The blood was good, and from this small feast we went on to a little German town where we could find a tavern. Here we sat, a man and his wife, one might presume, and over our mulled wine we talked for hours. I told Bianca all I had ever known of Those Who Must Be Kept. I told her the legends of Egypt\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;of how the Mother and Father had centuries ago been bound and ill used by those who would steal their Precious Blood. I told her of how Akasha herself had come to me in a vision begging me to take her out of Egypt. I told her of the few times Akasha had ever spoken to me in the Blood. And I told her finally, finally, of what a pure miracle it had been that the Divine Parents had opened the door of the Alpine shrine when I had come to them too weak to budge it. \"Do they need me?\" I asked. I looked into Bianca\u0027s eyes. \"I can\u0027t know. That\u0027s the horror. Do they want to be seen by others? I am in ignorance. \"But let me make my final confession. I became so angry last night because centuries ago when Pandora first drank the Mother\u0027s blood, she was full of dreams of bringing back to the Divine Parents the old worship. By that I mean, a worship that included the Druidic Gods of the Grove, a religion that went back to the temples of Egypt. \"I was furious that Pandora could believe in such a thing, and on the very night of Pandora\u0027s making I broke her dreams with my forceful logic. And I went beyond that. I pounded with my fist upon the Mother\u0027s very breast and demanded that she speak to us.\" Bianca was amazed. \"Can you guess what happened?\" I asked. \"Nothing. The Mother gave no answer.\" I nodded. \"And there came no rebuke or punishment either. Perhaps the Mother had brought Pandora to me. We could never know. But please understand how I fear the very notion that the Divine Parents might ever be worshiped. \"Bianca, we are immortals, yes, and we possess our King and Queen, but we must never for a moment believe that we understand them.\" To all this she nodded. She weighed it all for a long time and then she spoke: \"I was very simply wrong in what I said to you,\" she told me. \"Not in all of it,\" I answered. \"Perhaps if Amadeo had seen the King and Queen, he would have escaped the Roman blood drinkers and come back to us. Yet there is another way of looking at it.\" \"Tell me.\" \"If he had known the secret of the Mother and the Father, he might have been forced to reveal it to Santino, and the demons would have returned to Venice, searching for me. They might have found both of us.\" \"Ah, yes, all this is true,\" she said. \"I begin to see all of it.\" We were easy now with each other in the tavern. The mortals around us took no notice. I talked on in a soft voice, telling her the story of how Mael had once tried, with my permission, to drink Akasha\u0027s blood and Enkil had moved to stop him. I told her the dreadful tale of Eudoxia. I told her of how I had left Constantinople. \"I don\u0027t know what it is with you, my love,\" I said, \"but somehow I can tell you everything. It was never so with Pandora. It was never so with Amadeo.\" She reached out and put her left hand on my cheek. \"Marius,\" she said. \"Speak freely always of Pandora. Don\u0027t ever think that I shall fail to understand your love for Pandora.\" I thought this over for many long moments. I took her right hand in mine and I kissed her fingers. \"Listen to me, my love,\" I said. \"With every prayer, I ask the Queen if you might drink. But I gain no clear answer. And after what I witnessed with Eudoxia and Mael, I cannot take you to her. And so I shall continue to give you my blood in so far as it will make you strong, but\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;.\" \"I understand you,\" she said. I leant across the table and kissed her. \"Last night in my anger I learnt many things. That I cannot live without you was one. But I learnt another. I can now cover great distances with ease. And I suspect my other powers have also increased beyond recent measure. I must test these powers. I must know how easily I can defeat those demons if ever they come near to me. And tonight I want to test my power of flight more than any other.\" \"And so you are telling me that you want to take me back to the shrine now, and go off to England.\" I nodded. \"The moon is full tonight, Bianca. I must see the isle of Britain in the light of the moon. I must discover this Order of the Talamasca with my own eyes. It\u0027s scarcely possible to believe in such purity.\" \"Why don\u0027t you take me with you?\" \"I must be swift,\" I answered. \"And if there\u0027s danger I must be swifter still to escape it. These are mortals after all. And Raymond Gallant is only one of them.\" \"You will be careful then, my love,\" she said. \"You know now more than ever that I very simply adore you.\" It seemed then we would never quarrel again, that such a thing was impossible. And it seemed imperative that I never lose her. As we went out into the darkness, as I wrapped her in my cloak, I pressed my lips to her forehead as I took her into the clouds and homeward. When I left her, it was two hours before midnight, and I meant to see Raymond Gallant before morning. Now, it had been many years since my meeting with him in Venice. He had been a young man then, and perhaps middle-aged at the time that I wrote my letter to him. So it did occur to me as I set out on my journey that he might no longer be living. Indeed, it was a terrible thought. But I believed in all he had told me about the Talamasca and so I was determined to approach them. As I moved towards the stars, the pleasure of the Cloud Gift was so divine that I almost lost myself in the rapture of the skies, dreaming above the isle of Britain, plunging to where I could see the land perfectly against the sea, not wanting to touch the solid Earth so soon or roam it so clumsily. But I had consulted many a map in recent years to find the location of East Anglia, and I soon saw below me an immense castle with ten rounded towers which I believed to be the very one engraved upon the gold coin which Raymond Gallant had long ago given me. The sheer size of the castle gave me doubts, however, but I willed myself to set foot on the steep hillside quite close to it. Some deep preternatural instinct told me that I had reached the right place. The air was cold as I began to walk, indeed as cold as it had been in the mountains which I had left behind me. Some of the woods had come back, which had no doubt been cut down once upon a time for the safety of the castle, and I rather liked the terrain and I enjoyed walking in it. I wore a full fur-lined cloak which I had taken from one of my victims. I had my customary weapons, a thick short broadsword, and a dagger. I wore a longer velvet tunic than was favored at the time, but this did not matter to me. My shoes were new and I had bought them from a cobbler in Geneva. As for the style of the castle, I figured it to be some five hundred years old, built in the time of William the Conqueror. I surmised that it had once had a moat and drawbridge. But these elements had long been abandoned, and I could see a great door before me, flanked by torches. At last I reached this door, and pulled the bell, hearing a loud clang deep within the courtyard. It did not take long for someone to come, and only then did I realize the curious propriety of what I\u0027d done. In my reverence for this Order of Scholars I had not \"listened\" outside to discover who they were. I had not hovered near their lighted tower windows. And now I found myself, a curious figure no doubt with my blue eyes and dark skin, standing before the porter. This young man couldn\u0027t have been more than seventeen, and he seemed both sleepy and indifferent as though my clarion had awakened him. \"I\u0027ve come in search of Lorwich,\" I said, \"in East Anglia. Have I reached the right place? \" \"You have,\" said the boy, wiping at his eyes and leaning upon the door. \"Can I say for what reason?\" \"I seek the Talamasca,\" I replied. The young man nodded. He opened the door widely, and I soon found myself in a great courtyard. There were wagons and coaches parked within. I could hear the faint sound of the horses in the stables. \"I seek Raymond Gallant,\" I said to the boy. \"Ah,\" he replied, as if these were the magic words that he needed from me. And then he led me further inside and shut the giant wood door behind us. \"I\u0027ll take you where you might wait,\" he said. \"I think that Raymond Gallant is sleeping.\" But he\u0027s alive, I thought. That\u0027s what matters. I caught the scent of many mortals in this place. I caught the scent of food that had recently been cooked. I caught the scent of oak fires and as I looked up I saw the faint smoke of chimneys against the sky which I had not perceived earlier. With no further questioning, I was soon led by torchlight up a winding stone stairway in one of the many towers. Over and over again I looked out of small windows at the bleak land. I saw the dim outline of a nearby town. I could see the patches of the farmers\u0027 fields. All looked so very peaceful. At last the boy anchored his torch, and, lighting a candle from it, opened two heavily carved doors to reveal a huge room with sparse but beautiful furnishings. It had been a long time since I had seen heavily carved tables and chairs, and fine tapestries. It had been a long time since I had seen rich golden candlesticks and handsome chests with velvet draperies. It all seemed a feast for the eyes, and I was about to sit down when there came rushing into the room a spry elderly man with streaming gray hair in a long heavy white nightshirt who gazed at me with brilliant gray eyes, crying out: \"Marius!\" It was Raymond Gallant, it was Raymond in his final years, and I felt a terrible shock of pleasure and pain as I looked at him. \"Raymond,\" I said, and I opened my arms, and gently enfolded him. How frail he felt. I kissed him on both cheeks. I held him back tenderly that I might look at him. His hair was still thick and his forehead smooth as it had been so long ago. And when he smiled, his mouth seemed that of the young man I remembered. \"Marius, what a wonder it is to see you,\" he cried. \"Why did you never write to me again? \" \"Raymond, I\u0027ve come. I can\u0027t account for time and what it means to us. I\u0027ve come, and I\u0027m here, and I\u0027m glad to be with you.\" He stopped, turning from right to left suddenly and then he cocked his head. He seemed as agile and quick as he had ever been. He was listening. \"They\u0027re all aware that you\u0027re here,\" he said, \"but don\u0027t worry. They won\u0027t dare to come into this room. They\u0027re far too disciplined for that. They know I will not permit it.\" I listened for a moment, and I confirmed what he had said. Mortals throughout the immense sprawling castle had sensed my presence. There were mind readers among these mortals. Others seemed to possess some keen hearing. But I distinguished no supernatural presence here. I caught no inkling of the \"infidel\" he had described in his letter. And I caught no menace from anyone either. Nevertheless, I marked the nearby window, and noting that it was heavily barred though otherwise open to the night, wondered if I could easily break through it. I thought that I could. I felt no fear. In fact, I felt no fear of this Talamasca because it seemed to feel no fear of me and had admitted me so guilelessly. \"Come, sit down with me, Marius,\" Raymond said. He drew me near to an immense fireplace. I tried not to gaze with concern at his thin palsied hands, or his thin shoulders. I thanked the gods that I had come tonight, and that he was still here to greet me. He called out to the sleepy boy who remained still at the door. \"Edgar, build the fire and light it, please. Marius, you will forgive me,\" he said. \"I\u0027m very cold. Do you mind it? I understand what happened to you.\" \"No, not at all, Raymond,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t fear fire forever on that account. Not only am I healed now, I\u0027m stronger than ever I was before. It\u0027s quite a mystery. And you, how old are you? Tell me, Raymond. I can\u0027t guess it.\" \"Eighty years, Marius,\" he said. He smiled. \"You don\u0027t know how I\u0027ve dreamed of your coming. I had so much more to tell you. I didn\u0027t dare to write it in a letter.\" \"And rightly so,\" I said, \"for the letter was read, and who knows what might have happened? As it was, the priest who received it for me could not make much of it. I understand everything, however.\" He motioned to the door. Two young men at once entered the room, and I made them out to be the simple sort rather like the busy Edgar who was piling up the oak in the fireplace. There were richly carved stone gargoyles above the fire. I rather liked them. \"Two chairs,\" said Raymond to the boys. \"We\u0027ll talk together. I\u0027ll tell you all lean.\" \"Why are you so generous to me, Raymond?\" I asked. I wanted so to comfort him, to stop his agitation. But as he smiled at me, as if to reassure me, as he put his hand gently on my arm, and urged me towards the two wooden chairs which the boys had brought to the hearth, I saw that he did not need my comfort. \"I\u0027m only very excited, my old friend,\" he said. \"You mustn\u0027t be concerned for me. Here, sit down. Is this comfortable enough for you?\" The chairs were as heavily carved as every bit of ornament in the room, and the arms were the paws of lions. I found them beautiful as well as comfortable. I looked about myself at the many bookshelves, and mused as I have often done on how all libraries subdue me and seduce me. I thought of books burnt and books lost. May this be a safe place for books, I thought, this Talamasca. \"I have been decades in a stone room,\" I said in a muted voice. \"I am quite comfortable. Will you send the boys away now?\" \"Yes, yes, of course, only let them bring me some warm wine,\" he replied. \"I need it.\" \"Please, how could I be so inconsiderate?\" I replied. We were now facing each other, and the fire had begun with a riot of deep good fragrance coming from the burning oak, and a warmth that I even enjoyed, I had to admit it. One of the boys had brought Raymond a red velvet dressing gown, and once he was clothed in this, and settled in his chair, he did not seem so fragile. His face was radiant after all, his cheeks actually rosy, and I could easily see the young man in him that I had once known. \"My friend, should anything come between us,\" he said, \"let me give you to know that she still travels in her old way, rapidly through many European cities. Never to England, for I don\u0027t think they want to cross the water, though no doubt they can, contrary to folklore.\" I laughed. \"Is that the folklore? That we can\u0027t cross water? It\u0027s nonsense,\" I said. I would have said more, but I wondered if it were wise. He apparently took no note of my hesitation. He plunged on: \"She has for the last few decades traveled under the name of the Marquis a De Malvrier, and her companion the Marquis of the same name, though it is she who goes to Court more often than he does. They\u0027re seen in Russia, in Bavaria, in Saxony\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;in countries in which old ceremony is honored, seeming from time to time to need the courtly balls and the immense Roman church ceremonies. But understand, I have gleaned my account of this from many different reports. I\u0027m sure of nothing.\" The warm wine was being set upon a small stand beside him. He took the cup in his hands. His hands were shaking. He drank from the wine. \"But how do such reports come to you?\" I asked. I was fascinated. There was no doubt he was telling me the truth. As for the rest of the house, I could hear its many inhabitants all around us, waiting in silence it seemed for some kind of summons. \"Forget them,\" he said. \"What can they learn from this audience?\" he asked. \"They are all faithful members. To answer your questions, we go out sometimes in the guise of priests seeking information about those whom we call vampires. We inquire as to mysterious deaths. And so we gather information which is meaningful to us when it may not be meaningful to others.\" \"Ah, of course. And you take note of the name when it is mentioned in Russia or Saxony or Bavaria.\" \"Exactly. I tell you it is De Malvrier. They have a liking for it. And I shall tell you something else.\" \"Please, you must.\" \"Several times we have found upon the wall of a church inscribed the name, Pandora.\" \"Ah, she\u0027s done this,\" I said, desperately trying to conceal my emotion. \"She wants to be discovered by me.\" I paused. \"This is painful for me,\" I said. \"I wonder if the one who travels with her even knows her by that name. Ah, this is painful, but why do you assist me?\" \"By my very life, I don\u0027t know,\" he said, \"except somehow I believe in you.\" \"What do you mean believe, believe that I\u0027m a wonder? That I\u0027m a demon? Believe what, Raymond, tell me? Oh, never mind, it doesn\u0027t matter, does it? We do things because our hearts impel us.\" \"Marius, my friend,\" he said, leaning forward and touching my knee with his right hand, \"long ago in Venice when I spied upon you, you know that I spoke to you with the purity of my mind. I read your thoughts also. I knew that you slew only those who were the degraded killers of their own sisters or brothers.\" \"That\u0027s true, Raymond, and it was that way with Pandora. But is it now?\" \"Yes, I think so,\" he said, \"for every ghastly crime imputed to the vampires whom these creatures may in fact be is connected to one who was known to be guilty of many murders. So you see it\u0027s not difficult for me to help you.\" \"Ah, so she is true to our vow,\" I whispered. \"I didn\u0027t think so, not when I heard of her harsh companion.\" I looked intently at Raymond, seeing with every passing moment more of the young man I had once known so briefly. It was saddening to me. It was dreadful. And the more I felt it, the more I tried to conceal it. What was my suffering to this, the slow triumph of old age? Nothing. \"Where was she seen last?\" I asked. \"On that point,\" he said, \"allow me to give you my interpretation of her behavior. She and her companion follow a pattern in their roamings. They go in rude circles, returning over and over again to one city. Once they have been some time in that city they begin their circles once more until they have gone as far afield as Russia. The central city of which I speak is Dresden.\" \"Dresden!\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know the place. I\u0027ve never been there.\" \"Oh, it cannot rival your gorgeous Italian cities. It cannot equal Paris or London. But it is the capital of Saxony and it lies on the Elbe River. It has been much adorned by the various Dukes who have ruled there. And invariably, I say invariably, these creatures\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;Pandora and her companion\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;return to Dresden. It may not be for twenty years, but they come back to Dresden.\" I fell silent in my excitement. Was this some pattern meant for me to interpret? Was this pattern meant for me to discover? Was it like a great round spiderweb meant sooner or later to ensnare me? Why else would Pandora and her companion follow such a life? I couldn\u0027t imagine it. But how did I dare to think Pandora even remembered me. She had written her name in the stone of the church wall, not mine. At last I heaved a great sigh. \"How can I tell you what all this means to me?\" I asked. \"You have given me marvelous news. I\u0027ll find her.\" \"Now,\" he said in the most confident manner, \"shall we take up the other matter which I mentioned to you in my letter?\" \"Amadeo,\" I whispered. \"What happened to the infidel? I sense no blood drinker in this place. Am I deceived? The creature\u0027s either very far afield or he\u0027s left you.\" \"The monster left us soon after I wrote to you. When he realized he could hunt for his victims throughout the countryside, he was gone. We could do nothing to control him. Our appeals to him that he feed only on evil men meant nothing to him. I don\u0027t even know if he still exists.\" \"You must guard yourselves against this individual,\" I said. I looked about myself at the spacious stone room. \"This seems a castle of remarkable size and strength. Nevertheless, we speak of a blood drinker.\" He nodded. \"We are well protected here, Marius. We do not admit everyone as we admitted you, take my word for it. But would you hear now what he told us?\" I bowed my head. I knew what Raymond would tell me. \"The Satan worshipers,\" I said, using the more specific words, \"the very ones who burnt my house in Venice, they prey upon humans in Paris. And my brilliant auburn-haired apprentice, Amadeo, is still their leader?\" \"As far as we know,\" he said. \"They are very clever. They hunt the poor, the diseased, the outcast. The renegade who told us so much explained that they fear \u0027places of light,\u0027 as they call them. They have taken to believing that it is not God\u0027s will for them to be richly clothed, or to enter churches. And your Amadeo now goes by the name of Armand. The renegade told us that Armand has the zeal of the converted.\" I was too miserable to say anything. I shut my eyes, and when I opened them I was looking at the fire which was burning very well in the deep fireplace. Then slowly my gaze shifted to Raymond Gallant who was staring at me intently. \"I have told you everything, really,\" he said. I gave him a faint, sad smile and I nodded. \"You\u0027ve been generous indeed. And many a time in the past when one was generous to me, I took from my tunic a purse of gold. But is such needed here? \" \"No,\" he said agreeably, shaking his head. \"We need no gold, Marius. Gold we have always had in great abundance. What is life without gold? But we have it.\" \"What can I do for you, then?\" I asked. \"I\u0027m in your debt. I\u0027ve been in your debt since the night we spoke in Venice.\" \"Talk to several of our members,\" he replied. \"Let them come into the room. Let them see you. Let them ask you questions. That is what you can do for me. Tell them only what you will. But create a truth for them which can be recorded for study by others.\" \"Of course. I\u0027ll do this willingly, but not in this library, Raymond, beautiful as it is. We must be in an open place. I have an instinctive fear of mortals who know what I am.\" I paused. \"In fact, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve ever been surrounded by such.\" He thought on this for a moment. Then he spoke: \"Our courtyard is too noisy, too close to the stables. Let it be on one of the towers. It will be cold, but I shall tell them all that they must dress warmly.\" \"Shall we elect the South Tower for our purpose?\" I asked. \"Bring no torches with you. The night is clear and the moon is full and all of you will be able to see me.\" I slipped out of the room then, hurrying down the stairs, and easily passing through one of the narrow stone windows. With preternatural speed I went to the battlements of the South Tower, and there waited in the mild wind for all of them to gather around me. Of course it seemed I had traveled by magic, but that I had not was one of the things which I meant to tell them. Within a quarter of an hour they were all assembled, some twenty well-dressed men, both young and old, and two handsome women, and I found myself in the midst of a circle. No torches, no. I was not in any conceivable danger. For a long moment I allowed them to look at me, and form whatever conception they desired, and then I spoke: \"You must tell me what you want to know. For my part, I tell you plainly that I am a blood drinker. I have lived for hundreds of years, and I can remember clearly when I was a mortal man. It was in Imperial Rome. You may record this. I have never separated my soul from that mortal time. I refuse to do it.\" For a moment only silence followed, but then Raymond began with the questions. Yes, we had a \"beginning,\" I explained but I could say nothing of it. Yes, we became much much stronger with time. Yes, we tended to be lone creatures or to choose our companions very carefully. Yes, we could make others. No, we were not instinctively vicious, and we felt a deep love for mortals which was often our spiritual undoing. There were countless other little questions. And I answered them all to the best of my ability. I would say nothing of our vulnerability to the sun or fire. As for the \"coven of vampires\" in Paris and Rome, I knew little. At last I said: \"It\u0027s time for me to leave now. I will travel hundreds of miles before dawn. I lodge in another country.\" \"But how do you travel?\" one of them asked. \"On the wind,\" I said. \"It\u0027s a gift that has come to me with the passing centuries.\" I went to Raymond and I took him in my arms again, and then turning to several of the others I bade them come and touch me so that they could see I was a real being. I stood back, took my knife and cut my hand with it, and held out my hand so that they could see the flesh heal. There were gasps from them. \"I must be gone now. Raymond, my thanks and my love,\" I said. \"But wait,\" said one of the most elderly of the men. He had been standing back all the while, leaning on a cane, listening to me as intently as all the others. \"I have one last question for you, Marius.\" \"Ask me,\" I said immediately. \"Do you know anything of our origins?\" For a moment I was puzzled. I couldn\u0027t quite imagine what he meant in this question. Then Raymond spoke: \"Do you know anything about how the Talamasca came to be? That is what we are asking you.\" \"No,\" I said in quiet astonishment. A silence fell over them all, and I realized quickly that they themselves were confused about how the Talamasca had come about. And it did come back to me that Raymond had told me something of this when first I met him. \"I hope you find your answers,\" I said. Then off I went into the darkness. But I didn\u0027t stay away. I did what I had failed to do on my arrival. I hovered quite close but just beyond their hearing and their vision. And with my powerful gifts, I listened to them as they roamed their many towers and their many libraries. How mysterious they were, how dedicated, how studious. Some night in the far future perhaps I would come to them again, only to learn more of them. But just now, I had to return to the shrine and to Bianca. She was still awake when I came into the blessed place. And I saw that she had lighted the hundred candles. This was a ceremony that I sometimes failed to do, and I was pleased to see it. \"And are you happy with your visit to the Talamasca?\" she asked in her frank voice. She had that beguiling look of simplicity on her face which always prompted me to tell her everything. \"I was most pleased. I found them the honest scholars they professed to be. I gave them what knowledge I could, but by no means what I might, for that would have been too foolish. But all they seek is knowledge and I left them more than happy.\" She narrowed her eyes as if she could not quite imagine what the Talamasca was and I understood her. I sat down beside her, folded her close and wrapped the fur cloak around us both. \"You smell of the cold, good wind,\" she said. \"Perhaps we are meant to be creatures of the shrine only, creatures of the cold sky and the inhospitable mountains.\" I said nothing, but in my mind I thought of only one thing: the far-off city of Dresden. Pandora sooner or later always returned to Dresden.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-30.html","bookId":2594,"book":{"id":2594,"title":"Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8)","description":"Storyline: Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8) Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice.
