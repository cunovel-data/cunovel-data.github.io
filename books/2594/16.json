He was the most revered painter in Florence, and those who complained of him were those for whom he had no time, for he was only a mortal man.\n In the Church of San Paolino, I found an altarpiece which was to drive me mad. The subject of the painting was a common one, I had discovered, usually called The Lamentation, being the scene of those weeping over the body of the dead Christ only just taken down from the Cross.\n It was a miracle of Botticelli\u0027s sensuality, most specifically in the tender representation of Christ himself who had the gorgeous body of a Greek god, and in the utter abandon of the woman who had pressed her face against that of his, for though Christ lay with his head hanging downward, she knelt upright and her eyes were therefore very near to Christ\u0027s mouth.\n Ah, to see these two faces seamlessly pressed to each other, and to see the delicacy of every face and form surrounding them, it was more than I could endure.\n How long would I let this torture me? How long must I go through this wanton enthusiasm, this mad celebration before I retreated to my loneliness and coldness in the vault? I knew how to punish myself, didn\u0027t I? Did I have to go out of my way to the city of Florence for this?\n There were reasons to be gone.\n Two other blood drinkers haunted this city who might want me out of it, but so far they had left me alone. They were very young and hardly very clever, nevertheless I did not want them to come upon me, and spread \"the legend of Marius\" any further than it had already gone.\n And then there was that monster I had encountered in Rome\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;that evil Santino who might come this far to harry me with his little Satan worshipers whom I so desperately deplored.\n But these things didn\u0027t really matter.\n I had time in Florence and I knew it. There were no Satan worshipers here and that was a good thing. I had time to suffer as much as I chose.\n And I was mad for this mortal, Botticelli, this painter, this genius, and I could scarce think of anything else.\n Meantime, there came from Botticelli\u0027s brilliance yet another immense pagan masterpiece which I beheld in the palazzo to which it was sent upon being finished\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a place into which I crept in the early hours of the morning to see the painting while the owners of the building slept.\n Once again, Botticelli had used Roman mythology, or perhaps the Greek mythology that lay behind it to create a garden\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;yes, of all things, a garden\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a garden of eternal springtime in which mythical figures made their sublime progress with harmonious gestures and dreamy expressions, their attitudes exquisitely gentle in the extreme.\n On one side of the verdant garden danced the youthful and inevitably beautiful Three Graces in transparent and billowing garments while on the other side came the goddess Flora, magnificently clothed and strewing flowers from her dress. The goddess Venus once more appeared in the center, dressed as a rich Florentine woman, her hand up in a gesture of welcome, her head tilted slightly to one side.\n The figure of Mercury in the far left corner, and several other mythic beings completed the gathering which entranced me so that I stood before the masterpiece for hours, perusing all the details, sometimes smiling, sometimes weeping, wiping at my face, and eyen now and then covering my eyes and then uncovering them again to see the vivid colors and the delicate gestures and attitudes of these creatures\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; the whole so reminiscent of the lost glory of Rome, and yet so utterly new and different from it that I thought, for loving all this, I will lose my mind.\n Any and all gardens which I had ever painted or imagined were obliterated by this painting. HOW would I ever rival, even in my dreams, such a work as this?\n How exquisite here to die of happiness after being so long miserable and alone. How exquisite to see this triumph of form and color after having studied with bitter sacrifice so many forms I could not understand.\n There is no despair in me anymore. There is only joy, continuous restless joy.\n Is that possible?\n Only reluctantly did I leave this painting of the springtime garden. Only reluctantly did I leave behind its dark flower-rich grass and overhanging orange trees. Only reluctantly did I move on to find more of Botticelli where I could.\n I might have staggered around Florence for nights on end, drunk on what I\u0027d seen in this painting. But there was more, much more, for me to see.\n Mark, all this time, as I slipped into churches to see more works by the Master, as I crept into a palazzo to see a famed painting by the Master of the irresistible god Mars sleeping helplessly on the grass beside a patient and watchful Venus, as I went about clasping my hands to my lips so as not to cry out crazily, I did not return to the workshop of the genius. I held myself back.\n \"You cannot interfere in his life,\" I told myself. \"You cannot come in with gold and draw him from his paintings. His is a mortal destiny. Already the entire city knows of him. Rome knows of him. His paintings will endure. He is not someone you need save from a gutter. He is the talk of Florence. He is the talk of the Pope\u0027s Palace in Rome. Leave him alone.\"\n And so I did not go back, though I was starving just to look at him, just to talk to him, just to tell him that the marvelous painting of the Three Graces and the other goddesses in the springtime garden was as glorious as anything that he had done.\n I would have paid him just to allow me to sit in his shop in the evening, and to watch him at his work. But this was wrong, all of it.\n I went back to the Church of San Paolino, and I stayed for a long time, staring at The Lamentation.\n It was far more stiff than his \"pagan\" paintings. Indeed, he had seldom done something quite this severe. And there was much darkness to the painting, in the deeply colored robes of the various figures, and in the shadowy recesses of the open tomb. But even in this severity there was a tenderness, a loveliness. And the two faces\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;that of Mary and Christ\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;which were pressed together\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;drew me and would not let me look away.\n Ah, Botticelli. How does one explain his gift? His figures though perfect were always slightly elongated, even the faces were elongated, and the expressions on the faces were sleepy and perhaps even ever so slightly unhappy, it is so difficult to say. All the figures of any one painting seemed lost in a communal dream.\n As for the paint he used\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the paint used by so many in Florence\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;it was far superior to anything we had had in the ancient days of Rome, in that it mixed simple egg yolk and ground pigment to achieve the colors and the glazes and the varnishes to make an application of unsurpassed brilliance and endurance. In other words, the works had a gloss that seemed miraculous to my eyes.\n So fascinated was I by this paint that I sent my mortal servant to procure all the available pigments for me, and the eggs, and to bring me by night an old apprentice who might mix up the colors for me, exactly to the right thickness, so I might paint a bit of work in my rented rooms.\n It was only an idle experiment, but I found myself working furiously and soon covering every bit of prepared wood and canvas which my apprentice and my servant had bought.\n They were, of course, shocked by my speed, which gave me pause. I had to be clever, not fantastical. Hadn\u0027t I learnt that long years ago when I\u0027d painted my banquet room as my guests cheered me on?\n I sent them away with plenty of gold, telling them to come back to me with more materials. As for what I had painted? It was some poor imitation of Botticelli, for even with my immortal blood I could not capture what he had captured. I could not make faces like those he had rendered, no, not by a very long way. There was something brittle and hopeless in what I painted. I could not look at my own work. I loathed it. There was something flat and Accusatory in the faces I had created. There was something ominous in the expressions that looked back at me from the walls.\n I went out into the night, restless, hearing those other blood drinkers, a young pair, fearful of me and rightly so, yet very attentive to what I did, for what reason I was unsure. I sent a silent message to all the immortal trash that might perturb me: Do not come near me for I am in a grand passion and will not tolerate being interrupted now.\n I crept into the Church of San Padirio and knelt down as I looked at The Lamentation, I ran my tongue against my sharp teeth. I hungered for blood as the beauty of the figures filled me. I could have taken a victim in the very church.\n And then the most evil idea came to me. It was purely evil just as the painting was purely religious. The idea came to me unbidden as if there really were a Satan in the world and that Satan had come crawling along the stone floor towards me and put the idea in my mind.\n \"You love him, Marius,\" said this Satan. \"Well, bring him over to you. Give Botticelli the Blood.\"\n I shivered quietly in the church. I slipped down, sitting against the stone wall. Again I felt the thirst. I was horrified that I had even thought of it yet I saw myself taking Botticelli in my arms. I saw myself sinking my teeth into Botticelli\u0027s throat. The blood of Botticelli. I thought of it. And my blood, my Hood given to him.\n \"Think how you have waited, Marius,\" said the evil voice of Satan. \"All these long centuries you have never given your blood to anyone. But you can give it to Botticelli! You can take Botticelli now.\"\n He would go on painting; he would have the Blood and his painting would be unparalleled. He would live forever with his talent\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;this humble man of some forty years who was grateful for a mere purse of gold\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;this humble man who had done the exquisite Christ I stared at, his head thrown back in the hand of Mary, whose eyes were pressed to his mouth.\n This was not something that would be done. No, this must never be done. I could not do it. I would not do it.\n Yet I rose slowly to my feet and I left the church and began walking through the dark narrow street, towards Botticelli\u0027s house.\n I could hear my heart inside me. And my mind seemed curiously empty, and my body light and predatory and full of evil, an evil which I freely admitted and totally understood. A high excitement filled me. Take Botticelli in your arms. Forever in your arms.\n And though I heard those other blood drinkers, those two young ones who followed me, I did not pay it any mind. They were far too fearful of me to come close to me. On I went for what I would choose to do.\n It was no more than a few blocks and I was there at Sandro\u0027s door and the lights were burning inside, and I had a purse of gold. Drifting, dreaming, thirsting, I knocked as I had the first time.\n No, this is something you will never do, I thought. You will not take someone so vital out of the world. You will not disturb the destiny of one who has given others so much to love and enjoy.\n It was Sandro\u0027s brother who came to the door, but this time he was courteous to me and he showed me into the shop where Botticelli was alone and at work.\n He turned to greet me as soon as I entered the spacious room.\n There loomed behind him a large panel, with a shockingly different aspect to it from any of his other work. I let my eyes drift over it for I thought this was what he wanted me to do, and I don\u0027t think I could hide from him my disapproval or fear.\n The blood hunger surged in me, but I put it away and stared only at the painting, thinking of nothing, not of Sandro, not of his death and rebirth through me, no, of nothing but the painting as I pretended to be human for him.\n It was a grim and chilling painting of the Trinity, with Christ on his Cross, the full figure of God the Father behind him, and a dove representing the Holy Spirit, just above the head of the Christ. On one side stood St. John the Baptist opening the scarlet robe of God the Father, and on the other, the penitent Magdalene, her long hair her only clothing as she stared grieving at the crucified Lord.\n It seemed a cruel use of Botticelli\u0027s talent! It seemed a ghastly thing. Oh, it was expertly done, yes, but how merciless it seemed.\n Only now did I know that in The Lamentation I had seen a perfect balance of light and dark forces. For I did riot see that balance here. On the contrary, it was astonishing that Botticelli could have done something as wholly dark as this. It was a harsh thing. Had I seen it elsewhere I would not have thought it was his work.\n And it seemed a profound judgment on me that I had thought for one moment of giving Botticelli the Dark Blood! Did the Christian God really live? Could he deter me? Could he judge me? Is that why I had come face to face with this painting with Botticelli standing beside it looking into my eyes?\n Botticelli was waiting for me to speak to him on account of this painting. He was waiting patiently to be wounded by what I meant to say. And deep inside me there was a love of Botticelli\u0027s talent which had nothing to do with God or the Devil or my own evil or power. That love of Botticelli\u0027s talent respected Botticelli and nothing mattered just now but that.\n I looked up again at the painting.\n \"Where is the innocence, Sandro?\" I asked him, making my tone as kind as I could.\n Again I fought the blood hunger. Look how old he is. If you don\u0027t do it Sandro Botticelli will die.\n \"Where is the tenderness in the painting?\" I asked. \"Where is the sublime sweetness that makes us forget everything? I see it only a little perhaps in the face of God the Father, but the rest\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;it\u0027s dark, Sandro. It\u0027s so unlike you, this darkness. I don\u0027t understand why you do it when you can do so much else.\"\n The blood hunger was raging but I had control of it. I was pushing it deep inside me. I loved him too much to do it. I could not do it. I could not endure the result if it were to be done.\n As for my remarks, he nodded. He was miserable. A man divided wanting to paint his goddesses on the one hand, and the sacred paintings as well.\n \"Marius,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t want to do what\u0027s sinful. I don\u0027t want to do what\u0027s evil, or what will make another person, simply by looking at a painting, commit a sin.\"\n \"You\u0027re very far from ever doing that, Sandro,\" I said. \"That\u0027s my view of it\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;that your goddesses are glorious as are your gods. In Rome, your frescoes of Christ were filled with light and beauty. Why journey into the darkness as you have done here?\"\n I took out the purse and put it on the table. I would leave now, and he would never know what true evil had come close to him. He would never dream of what I was and what I had meant, perhaps, perhaps to do.\n He came to me and picked up the purse and tried to give it back.\n \"No, you keep it,\" I said. \"You deserve it. You do what you believe you should do.\"\n \"Marius, I have to do what is right,\" he said simply. \"Now look at this, I want to show you.\" He took me to another part of the workshop away from the large paintings.\n Here was a table and on it were several pages of parchment covered with tiny drawings.\n \"These are illustrations for Dante\u0027s Inferno\" he told me. \"Surely you\u0027ve read it. I want to do an illustrated version of the entire book.\"\n My heart sank when I heard this, but what could I say? I looked down at the drawings of the twisted and suffering bodies! How could one defend such an enterprise on the part of the painter who had rendered Venus and the Virgin with miraculous skill?\n Dante\u0027s Inferno. How I had despised the work while recognizing its brilliance.\n \"Sandro, how can you want to do this?\" I asked. I was shaking. I didn\u0027t want him to see my face. \"I find glory,\" I said, \"in those paintings that are filled with the light of paradise, whether it is Christian or pagan. I find no delight in the illustrations of those who suffer in Hell.\" He was plainly confused and perhaps he always would be. It was his fate. I had only stepped into it, and perhaps fed a fire that was already top weak to survive.\n I had to go now. I had to leave him now forever. I knew it. I could not come again to this house. I could not trust myself with him. I had to get out of Florence or my resolve would break. \"I won\u0027t be seeing you again, Sandro,\" I said. \"But why?\" he said. \"I\u0027ve been looking forward to seeing you. Oh, it\u0027s not because of the purse, believe me.\"\n \"I know, but I must leave. Remember. I believe in your gods and goddesses. I always will.\"\n I went out of his house, and only as far as the church. I was so overcome with the desire for him, to bring him over to me, and visit upon him all the dark secrets of the Blood, that I could scarce catch my breath or see the street before me, or even feel the air in my lungs.\n I wanted him. I wanted his talent. I dreamt dreams of the two of us\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;Sandro and me\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;together in a great palazzo, and from there would come paintings tinged with the magic of the Blood. It would be a confirmation of the Blood.\n After all, 1 thought, he is ruining his own talent, is he not, by turning to what is dark? How can one account for it that he would turn from his goddesses to a poem called the Inferno. Can I not turn him back to his celestial visions with the Blood?\n But none of this must happen. I knew it even before I\u0027d seen his cruel crucifixion. I had known it before I went into his house.\n I must find a victim now; I must find many. And so I hunted cruelly, until I could take no more blood from the few doomed souls I found in the streets of Florence.\n At last an hour or so before dawn, I found myself sitting against a church door in a small piazza, looking like a beggar perhaps if beggars fit themselves out with crimson cloaks.\n Those two young vampires whom I had heard following me came with fearful steps towards me.\n I was weary and impatient.\n \"Get away from me,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll destroy you both if you don\u0027t.\"\n A young male, a young female, each taken in youth and both trembling, they would not retreat. At last the male spoke for them, his courage tremulous but real.\n \"Don\u0027t you harm Botticelli!\" he declared. \"Don\u0027t you hurt him! Take the dregs, yes, you\u0027re welcome, but not Botticelli, never Botticelli.\"\n Sadly I laughed. My head fell back and very softly I laughed and laughed.\n \"I won\u0027t do it,\" I said. \"I love him as much as you do. Now get away from me. Or believe me, there will be no more nights for either one of you. GO.\"\n Returning to the vault in the mountains, I wept for Botticelli.\n I closed my eyes, and I entered the garden where Flora dropped her tender roses to the carpet of grass and flowers. I reached out to touch the hair of one of the young Graces.\n \"Pandora,\" I whispered. \"Pandora, it\u0027s our garden. They were all beautiful like you.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-16.html","bookId":2594,"book":{"id":2594,"title":"Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8) \n Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice.
