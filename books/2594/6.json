{"id":96708,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"6 FOR A FULL MONTH, I didn\u0027t dare to go to the shrine of Those Who Must Be Kept. I knew that Mael and Avicus still hunted Rome. I caught glimpses of them with the Mind Gift and occasionally I even spied upon their very thoughts. Sometimes I heard their steps. Indeed it seemed to me that Mael was actually tormenting me with his presence, attempting to ruin my tenure in the great city, and this made me bitter. I contemplated attempting to drive him and his companion away. I also suffered considerable preoccupation with Avicus, whose face I could not forget. What was the disposition of this strange being, I thought. What would it mean for him to be my companion? I feared I would never know. Meantime, other blood drinkers occasionally hunted the city. I felt their presence immediately, and there was no doubt on one particular night that a skirmish occurred between a powerful and hostile blood drinker and Avicus and Mael. With the Mind Gift I knew all that took place. Avicus and Mael so frightened the visitor that he was gone before morning, and had even given word in a lowly voice that he would never come to Rome again. This put me to pondering. Would Avicus and Mael keep the city clean of others, while leaving me alone? As the months passed this seemed to be the case. A small band of Christian blood drinkers tried to infest our hunting ground. Indeed they came from the same tribe of snake worshipers who had come to me in Antioch insisting that I had old truths. With the Mind Gift I saw them fervently setting up their temple where they meant to sacrifice mortals. I was deeply repelled. But once again Avicus and Mael put them to rout, apparently without being contaminated by their extravagant ideas about us serving Satan\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a personage for whom Avicus and Mael would have had no use as they were pagans. And the city was ours again. I did note in watching these activities from afar, however, that neither Mael nor Avicus seemed to know his own strength. They might have escaped the Druids of Britain by using their supernatural skills, but they were unaware of a secret which I had already learnt\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;that their powers increased with time. Now I had drunk the blood of the Mother so I fancied myself much stronger than either of them on that account. But quite apart from that, my strength had increased with the centuries. I could now reach the top of a four-story tenement\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;of which there were many in Rome\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;with comparative ease. And no band of mortal soldiers could have ever taken me prisoner. My speed was far too great for that. Indeed when I took my victims, I already faced the problem of the old ones, to restrain my powerful hands from crushing out the life that pumped the blood into my mouth. And oh, was I ever still thirsty for that blood! But as I spied upon these various activities\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the routing of the Satanic vampires\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;I stayed away from the shrine of Akasha and Enkil for too long. Finally one early evening, using my skills at their most powerful to cloak my presence, I did go out into the hills and to the shrine. I felt that I had to make this visit. Never had I left the Great Pair alone for such a period, and I did not know whether or not there might be consequences for such neglect. Now I realize such a fear was utterly ridiculous. As the years passed I could neglect the shrine for centuries. It was of no consequence whatsoever. But then I had only begun to learn. And so I came to the new and barren chapel. I brought with me the requisite flowers and incense, and several bottles of scent with which to sprinkle Akasha\u0027s garments, and once I had lighted the lamps and set the incense to burning, once the flowers were in their vases, I felt an overall weakness and went down on my knees. Let me remind you again that during my years with Pandora, I almost never prayed in this mariner. But now Akasha belonged only to me. I looked up at the unchanged couple, with their long black plaited hair, seated on the throne as I had left them, both freshly dressed in their Egyptian clothes of fine linen, Akasha in her pleated gown, the King in his kilt. Akasha\u0027s eyes still wore the imperishable black paint which Pandora had so carefully applied. And around Akasha\u0027s head was the glistening gold diadem with its rubies which Pandora had placed there with loving hands. Even the gold snake bracelets on her graceful upper arms had been the gift of Pandora. And on the feet of the two were the sandals which Pandora had fastened with care. It seemed in the wealth of light that they had grown paler in complexion and I know now, centuries later, that I was right. They were healing rapidly from the Terrible Fire. On this particular visit, I also paid keen attention to the expression of Enkil. I was too aware of the fact that he did not and had never incited my devotion, and I thought this was unwise. In Egypt when I had first come to find them \u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; a zealous new blood drinker, inflamed by Akasha\u0027s plea to take them out of Egypt \u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; he had moved to block my path to the Queen. Only with difficulty had he been made to return to his posture of seated King. Akasha had cooperated in that all-important moment, but the movements of both of them had been sluggish and unearthly and dreadful to behold. That had been three hundred years ago, and the only gesture from either of them since had been the open arm of Akasha to welcome Pandora to herself. Oh, how Pandora had been blessed in that gesture from Akasha! I would never forget it all my long years. What were Enkil\u0027s thoughts, I asked myself. Was he ever jealous that I addressed my prayers to Akasha? Did he even know? Whatever the case, I told him in a silent voice that I was devoted to him, that I would always protect him and his Queen. At last, reason left me as I gazed on them. I let Akasha know how much I revered her and how dangerous it had been for me to come. Only out of caution had I remained away. I would never on my own have left the shrine deserted. Indeed, I should have been here, using my vampiric skill to create paintings for the walls or to make for them mosaics\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; for though I never thought of myself as having possessed any skill in this regard\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; I had used my powers to make passable decorations for the shrine in Antioch, indeed very good ones, whiling away the lonely hours of the night. But here the walls were simply whitewashed and the abundant flowers I\u0027d brought seemed welcome color indeed. \"My Queen, help me,\" I prayed. And then as I meant to explain how miserable I was over the nearness of these two fellow blood drinkers, a dreadful and obvious thought came to my mind. I could never have Avicus for a companion. I could never have anyone. For any blood drinker of even passable skill could learn from my mind the secret of Those Who Must Be Kept. It had been vain and foolish for me to offer clothing and lodging to Avicus and Mael. I was doomed to be alone. I felt sickened and cold in my misery. I looked up to the Queen and I could form no prayers with words. Then quite helplessly I begged: \"Bring Pandora back to me. If ever you brought her to me in the first place, bring her back, I beg you, I\u0027ll never quarrel with her again. I\u0027ll never abuse her again. This is unendurable, this loneliness. I need to hear the sound of her voice. I need to see her.\" On and on I went in this manner, until suddenly I became alarmed that Avicus and Mael might be near to me, and I rose to my feet, straightened out my garments and made to take my leave. \"I\u0027ll return,\" I told the Mother and Father. \"I\u0027ll make this shrine beautiful like the one in Antioch. Only let us wait until they\u0027ve gone.\" I was about to go out when abruptly the thought occurred to me\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;I needed more of Akasha\u0027s powerful blood. I needed it to be stronger than my foes. I needed it to endure what I had to endure. Now understand, never since the first night that I had drunk from Akasha, had I taken more of her blood. That first night had been in Egypt when she told me with the Mind Gift to take her out of the land. Then and only then had I experienced the blood. Even when Pandora was made a blood drinker, and she drank from Akasha, I had not dared to approach the Mother. In fact, I knew well how the Mother might strike down those who came by force to steal the Sacred Blood from her, for I\u0027d witnessed such an aborted crime. Now as I stood before the small dais with its seated royalty, the idea obsessed me. I must again take the Mother\u0027s blood. In silence I begged permission. I waited for a sign. When Pandora had been made, Akasha had lifted her arm to beckon. I had seen it and marveled at it. I wanted such a thing to happen now. No such sign came to me, however, and yet the obsession raged within me, until I moved forward, quite determined to drink the Divine Blood or die. I found myself suddenly embracing my cold and lovely Akasha with one arm behind her and the other lifted so that my hand held her head. Closer and closer I came to her neck. At last my lips were pressed against her cool unresponsive flesh and she had made no move to destroy me. I felt no fatal clasp on the back of my head. Silent as ever she remained in my arms. Finally my teeth broke the surface of her skin and the thick blood, blood like that of no other among us, came into my mouth. At once I found myself dreamy and cast adrift in an impossible paradise of sunshine and green grass and flowering trees. What a comfort it was, what a balm. It seemed a garden of old Roman myth, one somehow familiar to me, protected forever from winter, and full of the most blessed blooms. Yes, familiar and forever safe, this verdant place. The blood ravaged me, and I could feel it hardening me, as it had the very first time it had come into my veins. The sun of the familiar garden grew brighter and brighter until the flowering trees began to disappear in the light. Part of me, some very small and weak part of me was afraid of it, this sun, but the larger part relished it, relished the warmth that was passing into me, and the comfort of what I beheld, and then all at once, as quickly as it had begun, this dream was ended. I lay on the cold hard floor of the shrine, several yards away from the foot of the dais. I was on my back. For a moment I was uncertain of what had happened. Was I injured? Was there to be some terrible justice in store? But within seconds, I realized I was as sound of limb as ever, and that the blood had greatly invigorated me just as I\u0027d supposed. I rose to my knees, and made certain with quick eyes that the Royal Pair remained as before. Why had I been thrown away from Akasha with such violence? Nothing was changed. Then for a long time I gave my silent thanks for what had taken Place. Only when I was certain that nothing further was to happen, I rose to my feet, and declaring that I would be back soon to begin my decorations of the shrine, I left. I was enormously excited as I returned to my house. My increased agility, and keenness of mind were more than welcome. I determined to test myself, and taking my dagger, I plunged it all the way through my left hand, and then withdrew it, watching the wound as it immediately healed. At once I spread out a scroll of the finest parchment and I began to write in my personal code which no other could read, of what had taken place. I didn\u0027t know why, after taking the Sacred Blood, I had found myself on the floor of the chapel. \"The Queen has allowed me to drink again from her, and if this is to happen often, if I can take nourishment from our mysterious majesty, I can attain enormous strength. Even the blood drinker Avicus will be no match for me, though this might have been the case before this night.\" Indeed, as it turned out I was precisely right about the implications of this incident, and during all the centuries to come, I approached Akasha again and again. I did this not only when severely injured\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a tale I mean to tell you\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;but I did it at times when the fancy caught hold of me as if she had put it in my mind. But never, never, as I have confessed with bitterness, did she ever press her teeth to my throat and take from me my own blood. No, that distinction was left for the blood drinker Lestat, as I have said. In the following months, this new blood served me well. I found that the Mind Gift was stronger in me. I could well detect the presence of Mael and Avicus when they were quite far away, and though such spying opens a mental passage as it were by which they could see me as their observer, I was able, after seeing them, to quickly close myself off. I was also able to tell quite easily when they were searching for my presence, and of course I heard, positively heard, their footsteps when they were in the precincts of my house. I also opened my house to humans! The decision came to me one evening as I lay on the grass in my own garden dreaming. I would have regular banquets. I would invite the notorious and the slandered. I would have music and dim lamps. I considered the matter from every perspective! I knew that I could arrange it. I knew that I could fool mortals as to my nature; and how their company would soothe my lonely heart! I did not go to my daily rest in my house, but in a hiding place far from it, so what danger could there be in this new decision? None whatsoever! It could easily be done. Naturally, I would never feed upon these guests. They would enjoy complete safety and hospitality under my roof, always. I would hunt in far precincts and under cover of darkness. But my house, my house would be full of warmth and music and life. Well, I went about it, and it proved far simpler than I had ever dreamt. Having my sweet and good-natured old slaves lay out tables rich with food and drink, I brought in the disreputable philosophers to talk away the night to me, and I listened to them in their rambling, as I did to the old and neglected soldiers who had tales of war to tell which their own children did not want to hear. Oh, this was a miracle, the admission of mortals to my very rooms, mortals who thought me to be alive as I nodded and coaxed them in their wine-fed stories. I was warmed by it, and I wished that Pandora were here with me to enjoy it for it was precisely the sort of thing which she would have wanted us to do. Soon my house was never empty, and I made the amazing discovery that should I become bored in the midst of this heated and drunken company it was a simple matter for me to get up and go into my library and begin writing, for all the drunken guests simply went on with each other, hardly noticing what I did and only rousing themselves to greet me when I returned. Understand, I did not become a friend to any of these dishonorable or disgraced creatures. I was only a warm-hearted host and spectator who listened without criticism and never\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;until dawn\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;turned anyone away. But it was a far cry from my former solitude, and without the strengthening blood of Akasha, and perhaps without my quarrel with Avicus and Mael, I would never have taken this step. And so my house became crowded and noisy, and wine sellers sought me out to offer their new vintages, and young men came to me, begging me to listen to their songs. Even a few fashionable philosophers appeared at my door from time to time, and once in a while a great teacher, and these I enjoyed immensely, making very certain that the lamps were very dim and that the rooms were most shadowy, so frightened was I that the sharp-minded might discover that I was not what I pretended to be. As for my trips to the shrine and Those Who Must Be Kept, I knew and traveled in total secrecy for my mind was more securely cloaked. And on certain nights\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;when the banquet in my house could well do without me\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and I held myself to be entirely safe from all intrusion, I went to the shrine and did the work which I supposed would comfort my poor Akasha and Enkil. During these years, rather than undertake mosaics which had proved very difficult for me in Antioch, though I had succeeded, I made murals on the walls of the common kind seen in so many Roman houses, of frolicking gods and goddesses in gardens of eternal springtime and bounteous flowers and fruit. I was hard at work one evening, singing to myself, happy among all the pots of paint when I suddenly realized that the garden I was faithfully rendering was in fact the garden I had seen when I drank Akasha\u0027s blood. I stopped, sat still on the floor of the shrine, as if I were a child, with crossed legs, and looked up at the venerable Parents. Was it meant to be? I had no idea. The garden looked vaguely familiar. Had I seen such a garden long before I had drunk Akasha\u0027s blood? I couldn\u0027t remember. And I, Marius, prided myself upon my memory. I went on with my work. I covered over a wall and started all over again to render it more nearly perfect. I made better trees and shrubbery. I painted the sunlight and the effects of it upon green leaves. When inspiration left me, I would use my blood drinker delicacy to creep into some fashionable villa outside the walls of the enormous and ever expanding city, and by the faintest light peruse the inevitably lush murals for new figures, new dances, new attitudes and smiles. Of course I could do this easily without waking anyone in the house, and sometimes I need have no worry of waking anyone, for no one was there. Rome was immense, busy as ever, but with all the wars, with all the shifting politics and scheming plotters and passing Emperors, people were being banished and recalled regularly, and great houses were often empty for me to quietly wander and enjoy. Meanwhile, in my house, my banquets had become so famous that my rooms were always full. And no matter what my goal for any night, I commenced it among the warm company of drunkards who\u0027d begun their feasting and quarreling before I ever arrived. \"Ah, Marius, welcome!\" they would cry out as I came into the room. How I smiled at them all, my treasured company. Never did anyone suspect me of anything, and I did grow to love some of these delightful creatures, but always I remembered that I was a predator of men, and could not therefore be loved by them, and so I kept my heart covered as it were. And so with this mortal comfort, the years passed, whilst I kept myself busy with the energy of a madman, either writing in my journals and subsequently burning them, or painting on the walls of the shrine. Meantime, the wretched serpent worshiping blood drinkers came again, attempting to establish their absurd temple within one of the neglected catacombs where mortal Christians no longer gathered, and once again, Avicus and Mael drove them away. I observed all this, immensely relieved that I had not been called upon to do anything, and painfully remembering when I had slaughtered such a band in Antioch and subsequently fallen into the piteous madness that had cost me the love of Pandora apparently for all time. But no, not for all time; surely she would come to me, I thought. I wrote about it in my journals. I put down my pen; I closed my eyes. I longed for her. I prayed that she would come to me. I envisioned her with her rippling brown hair and melancholy oval face. I tried to remember with exactitude the shape and the fine color of her dark eyes. How she had argued with me. How she had known the poets and philosophers. How she had been able to reason. And I, I had mocked her all too much. I cannot tell you how many years passed in this fashion. I was aware that even though we did not speak to one another, or even face each other in the street, Avicus and Mael had become companions to me by their very presence. And as for their keeping Rome clean of other blood drinkers, I was in their debt. Now, I didn\u0027t pay much attention to what was happening with the government of the Empire as I think you can ascertain from all I\u0027ve said. But in truth I cared passionately about the fate of the Empire. For the Empire to me was the civilized world. And though I was a secret hunter by night, a filthy killer of humans, nevertheless I was a Roman, and I lived in all other ways a civilized life. I suppose that I assumed, much like many an old Senator of the time, that sooner or later the endless battles of the Emperors would sort themselves out. A great man, with the strength of Octavian, would rise to unite the entire world once again. Meantime the armies would patrol the borders, endlessly driving back the barbarian menace, and if the responsibility fell, over and over again to the armies to choose an Emperor, so be it, as long as the Empire remained intact. As for the Christians who existed everywhere, I did not know what to make of them at all. It was a great mystery to me that this little cult, which had begun in Jerusalem of all places, could have grown to such tremendous size. Before I\u0027d left Antioch, I\u0027d been amazed by the success of Christianity, of how it was becoming organized, and how it seemed to thrive on division and dissent. But Antioch was the East as I have said. That Rome was capitulating to the Christians was beyond my wildest dreams. Slaves had everywhere gone over to the new religion, but so had men and women of high position. And persecutions had no effect at all. Before I continue, however, allow me to point out what other historians have also pointed out, that before Christianity, the entire ancient world lived in a kind of religious harmony. No one persecuted anyone else for religion. Even the Jews who would associate with no one else were easily infolded by Greeks and Romans and allowed to practice their extremely anti-social beliefs. It was they who rebelled against Rome, not Rome which sought to enslave them. And so this harmony was worldwide. Of course all of this led me to believe, when I first heard Christians preaching, that there was no chance of this religion gaining ground. It placed far too much responsibility upon the new members to avoid all contact with the revered gods of Greece and Rome, and so I thought the sect would soon die out. Also there was the constant strife among the Christians as to what they really believed. Surely they would destroy one another, I thought, and the whole body of ideas, or whatever it could be called, would dissolve. But no such thing happened, and the Rome in which I lived in the three hundreds was thronged with Christians, as I\u0027ve said. For their apparently magical ceremonies, they met in the catacombs and also in private homes. Now as I went along, watching all this, and yet ignoring it, there were a couple of events which stunned me out of my dreams. Let me explain. As I have said, the Emperors of Rome were constantly at war. No sooner had the old Roman Senate ratified the appointment of one than he was murdered by another. And troops were always marching across the far-flung provinces of the Empire to establish a new Caesar where another had been put to rout. In the year of 305, there were two of these sovereigns known as Augusti, and two known as Caesars, and I myself did not know precisely what these titles meant. Or shall I say, I had too much contempt for all involved to know what they meant. Indeed these so-called \"Emperors\" more often than I liked were invading Italy and one by the name of Severus in the year 307 had come all the way to the gates of Rome. Now I, with little more than the greatness of Rome to keep me company, did not want to see my native city sacked! It soon became clear to me when I started to pay attention that all of Italy as well as Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia and North Africa were all under the rule of the \"Emperor\" Maxentius, and it was he who had-repelled Severus and was now repelling yet another invader, Galerius, whom he chased away in defeat. This Maxentius who lived only six miles from the city walls was himself a beast. At one extremely unhappy event, he allowed the praetorians, that is, his personal guards, to massacre the people of Rome. And he was very against the Christians whom he persecuted needlessly and cruelly; and the gossip had it that he debauched the wives of outstanding citizens, thereby giving the greater offense. In fact, the Senators suffered a great deal of abuse at his hands, while he let his soldiers run riot in Rome. None of this meant much to me, however, until I heard that one of me other Emperors\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;Constantine\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;was marching on Rome. This was the third threat in recent years to my beloved city; and I was much relieved when Maxentius went out to fight the important battle a great distance from the walls. Of course he did this because he knew the Romans would not support him. But who could have known that this was to be one of the most decisive battles in the history of the Western world? Of course the battle occurred in the day so that I could know nothing of it until I waked with the setting sun. At once, I rushed up the stairs from my underground hiding place and, coming to my house, I found all my regular philosopher guests drunk, and I went out into the streets to learn what I could from the citizenry of what had taken place. Constantine was completely the victor. He had massacred the troops of Maxentius and the latter had fallen into the Tiber and drowned. But what was most significant to those congregating everywhere was the rumor that before Constantine went into battle he had seen a sign in the sky which had come from Jesus Christ. Indeed the sign had been made manifest right after noon when Constantine had looked up and beheld just above the declining sun, the sign of the cross with the inscription \"Conquer with This.\" My reaction was incredulity. Could a Roman Emperor possibly have seen a Christian vision? I went rushing back to my desk, wrote down all these particulars in my precarious journal of events and waited to see what history would reveal. As for the company in my banquet room they were now all awake and arguing about the whole matter. None of us believed it. Constantine a Christian? More wine, please. At once, to everyone\u0027s amazement, but without doubt, Constantine revealed himself to be a Christian man. Instead of endowing temples to celebrate his great victory, as was the custom, he endowed Christian churches, and sent out word to his governors that they should behave in the same manner as he had done. Then he presented the Pope of the Christians with a palace on the Coelian Hill. And let me point out that this palace was to remain in the hands of the Popes of Rome for a thousand years. I had once known those who lived in it, and I went myself to see the Vicar of Christ ensconced in it, and speculated as to what all this would mean. Soon laws were passed which forbade crucifixion as a form of execution, and also forbade the popular gladiatorial games. Sunday became a holiday. And the Emperor extended other benefits to the Christians, and very soon we heard that Christians were petitioning him to take part in their doctrinal disputes! Indeed, their arguing over matters of doctrine became so serious in African cities that riots broke out in which Christians murdered each other. People wanted the Emperor to intervene. I think this is a very important thing to understand about Christianity.It was from its very beginnings, it seems, a religion of great quarrels and wars, and it wooed the power of temporal authorities, and made them part of itself in the hope of resolving through sheer force its many arguments. All this I watched with amazed eyes. Of course my guests argued furiously about it. It seemed some who were dining at my table were Christians and had been all along. Now it was out in the open, yet the wine flowed and the music went on. Understand, I had no real fear of or inherent distaste for Christianity. As I have said, I witnessed its growth with amazement. And now\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;as ten years or more passed during which Constantine shared the Empire uneasily with Lacinius, I saw changes that I did not believe would ever take place. Obviously the old persecutions had been utter failures. Christianity was a marvelous success. There seemed to me to be a blending of Roman thinking with Christian ideas. Perhaps one should say it was a blending of styles, and ways of looking at the world. Finally\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;when Lacinius was gone, Constantine became the sole ruler of the Empire and we saw all of its provinces united once more. He became obviously more concerned with the disunity of the Christians and we heard word in Rome of huge Christian councils in the East. The first took place at Antioch where I had lived with Pandora and which was still a great city, perhaps in many respects more lively and interesting at this point than Rome. The Arian heresy was the cause of Constantine\u0027s discontent. And the whole thing had to do with something extremely small in the Scriptures which seemed to Constantine to be hardly worth the dispute. Nevertheless certain Bishops were excommunicated from the growing Church, and another more important council was held in Nicaea only two months later, where Constantine presided again. There the Nicene Creed was adopted, which is recited by Christians even in the present time. The Bishops who signed this Creed effectively again condemned and excommunicated the theorist and Christian writer Arius as a heretic and doomed his writings to be burnt. He himself was to be shut out of his native Alexandria. The Judgment was absolute. But it is worth noting, and I did, that Arius continued his struggle for recognition, even though the council had cast him out. The other great affair of this council, and a matter which is still rather confusing in Christianity, was the question of the true date of Easter, or the anniversary of the resurrection of Christ. A determination was made as to how this date would be calculated, and it was based upon a Western system. And then the council came to an end. Now the Bishops who had come to the council were asked to stay and help the Emperor celebrate his twenty years on the throne, and of course they did so, for how could they refuse? But as soon as word reached Rome of these elaborate festivities, there was much jealousy and discontent. Rome felt ignored in all these goings-on. And so there was considerable relief and happiness when in January of 326, the Emperor headed for our city once again. Before his arrival, however, terrible deeds became attached to Constantine\u0027s name. For reasons nobody could discover, he stopped along the way to put to death both his son Crispus and his stepson, Licinianus, and his own wife, the Empress Fausta. Historians can speculate forever as to why all this happened. The truth is, nobody knows why Constantine committed these acts. There may have been a plot against him. Perhaps there was not. Let me say here that it cast a cloud over his arrival among the Romans, and that when he did come, it was no great consolation to the old ruling class, because he dressed very much in the extravagant Eastern style, with silk and damask, and would not be part of the important procession to the Temple of Jupiter, as the people had expected him to do. Of course the Christians adored him. Rich and poor they flocked to see him in his Eastern robes and jewels. They were overwhelmed with his generosity as he laid the ground for more churches. And though he had spent almost no time in Rome, he had over the years allowed for the completion of secular buildings begun by Maxentius, and he built a large public bath under his own name. Then came appalling rumors. Constantine had plans for an entirely new city. Constantine found Rome old and decayed and lacking as a capital. Constantine meant to make a new city for the Empire; he meant to make it in the East, and it would honor his name! Imagine it, if you can. Of course the Emperors of the last century had moved all over the provinces of the Empire. They had fought each other, breaking into pairs and tetrarchies, and meeting here and murdering one another there. But to give up Rome as the capital? To create another great city to be the center of the Empire? It was unthinkable to me. I brooded in hatred. I knew despair. All of my nightly guests shared my misery. The elderly soldiers were broken by the news and one of the old philosophers wept bitterly. Another city to be the capital of the Roman Empire? The younger men were furious, but they could not hide their bitter curiosity, or their grudging guesses as to where this new city might be. I could not dare weep as I wanted to for my tears would have been full of blood. I asked the musicians to play old songs, songs I had to teach them for they had never heard them, and there came a strange moment when we sang together\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;my mortal guests and me\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a slow mournful song about Rome\u0027s tarnished glory which we would not forget. The air was cool on that evening. I went out into the garden and looked down over the side of the hill. I could see lights here and there in the darkness. I could hear laughter and conversation from other houses. \"This is Rome!\" I whispered. How could Constantine abandon the city which had been the capital of the Empire for a thousand years of struggle, triumph, defeat, glory? Couldn\u0027t someone reason with him? This simply could not come to pass. But the more I roamed the city, the more I listened to talk both far and wide, the more I roamed outside the walls and into the towns thereabout, I came to see what had motivated the Emperor. Constantine wanted to begin his Christian Empire in a place of incredible advantage, and could not retreat to the Italian peninsula when so much of the culture of his people lay to the East. Also he had to defend his Eastern borders. The Persian Empire of the East was always a threat. And Rome was not a fit place for a man in supreme power to reside. Thus Constantine had chosen the distant Greek city of Byzantium to be the site of Constantinople, his new home. And I should see my home, my sacred city, become now a castoff of a man whom I, as a Roman, could not accept. There were rumors of the incredible if not miraculous speed with which Constantinople had been mapped out, and with which building was being done. At once many Romans followed Constantine to the burgeoning new city. At his invitation perhaps, or simply on their own impulse Senators decamped with their families and their wealth to live in this new and shining place, a subject on everyone\u0027s lips. Soon I heard that Senators from all the cities of the Empire were being drawn to Constantinople, and indeed, as baths and meeting halls and circuses were erected in the new capital, beautiful statues were being looted from cities throughout Greece and Asia to adorn the new architectural works. Rome, my Rome, what will become of you, I thought. Of course my evening feasts were not really deeply affected. Those who came to dine with Marius were poor teachers and historians who had no means of moving to Constantinople, or curious and reckless young men who had not made the clever choice as yet. I had plenty of mortal company as always, and indeed, I had inherited a few very quick-witted Greek philosophers who had been left behind by families who had gone to Constantinople where they would no doubt find more brilliant men to tutor their sons. But this, the company in my house was a small matter. In truth, as the years passed, my soul was crushed. And it struck me as more than ever dreadful that I had no other immortal companion who might understand what I felt. I wondered if Mael or Avicus could possibly comprehend what was going on. I knew they still haunted the same streets as I did. I heard them. And my need of Pandora became so terrible that I could not envision her or think of her anymore. But still, I thought desperately, if this man Constantine can preserve the Empire, if Christianity can bind it and prevent it from breaking apart, if its disparate provinces can be united, if Constantine can keep back the barbarians who forever pillage without building or preserving anything, who am I to judge him, I, who am outside of life? I went back to my scribbling on the nights when my mind was feverish. And on those when I was certain that Mael and Avicus were nowhere in the vicinity I went out into the country to visit the shrine. My work on the walls of the shrine was continuous. As soon as I finished painting the walls of the entire chapel, I covered over a wall and began painting again. I could not make my nymphs and goddesses to suit my standards. Their figures were not slender enough for me, and the arms not graceful enough. Their hair was not right. And as for the gardens I rendered, there were not enough kinds of flowers for me to include. Always, there was that sense of familiarity\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;that I had seen this garden that I had known it long before I was allowed by Akasha to drink her blood. I had seen the stone benches in it, I had seen the fountains. I couldn\u0027t shake the sensations of being in it as I painted, so strong was the feeling. I\u0027m not sure it aided me in my work. Perhaps it hurt. But as I gained skill as a painter, and I did indeed gain skill, other aspects of the work disturbed me. I was convinced that there was something unnatural in it, something inherently ghastly in the manner with which I drew human figures so nearly perfectly, something unnatural in the way I made the colors so unusually bright, and added so many fierce little details. I was particularly repelled by my penchant for decorative details. As much as I was driven to do this work, I hated it. I composed whole gardens of lovely mythic creatures only to rub them out.Sometimes I painted so fast that I exhausted myself, and fell down on the floor of the shrine, spending the paralytic sleep of the whole day there, helpless, rather than going to my secret resting place\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;my coffin\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; which was hidden not far from my house. We are monsters, that is what I thought whenever I painted or looked on my own painting, and that\u0027s what I think now. Never mind that I want to go on existing. We are unnatural. We are witnesses with both too much and too little feeling. And as I thought these things, I had before me the mute witnesses, Akasha and Enkil. What did it matter to them what I did? Perhaps twice a year I changed their fancy garments, arranging Akasha\u0027s gown with fastidious care. I brought new bracelets for her more often and put these on her cold sluggish arms with slow tender movements so as not to insult her by what I did. I fussed with the gold in the black plaited hair of both Parents. I arranged a handsome necklace around the naked shoulders of the King. I never spoke to either of them idly. They were too grand for that. I addressed them only in prayer. I was silent in the shrine as I worked, with my paint pots and brushes. I was silent as I sat there peering in frank disgust at what I\u0027d done. Then one night, after many years of diligence in the shrine, I stood back and tried to see the whole as never before. My head was swimming. I went to the entrance to take the stance of a man who was new the place, and forgetting utterly the Divine Pair, I merely looked at the walls. A truth came clear to me in painful clarity. I had painted Pandora. I had painted her everywhere. Each nymph, each goddess, was Pandora. Why hadn\u0027t I known? I was amazed and defeated. My eyes are playing tricks on me, I thought. I wiped them, actually wiped them as a mortal might do, to see all the better and looked again. No. It was Pandora, rendered beautifully everywhere that I looked. Dresses changed and style of hair, yes, and other adornments but these creatures were all Pandora, and I had not seen it until now. Of course the never ending garden looked familiar. Never mind that. Pandora had little or nothing to do with those feelings. Pandora was inescapable and came from some different fount of sensations. Pandora would never leave me. That was the curse. I concealed all my paints and brushes behind the Divine Parents as I always did\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;it would have been an insult to the Father and Mother to leave them\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and I went back to Rome. I had before me several hours before dawn in which to suffer, in which to think of Pandora as never before. The drunken party was winding down a bit as it always did in the small hours, with a few guests asleep in the grass outside, and others singing together in a small group, and no one took notice of me as I went into my library, and sat at my desk. Through the open doors I looked out at the dark trees and wished that my life were at an end. It seemed I lacked the courage to go on in the existence which I\u0027d made for myself, and then I turned and decided\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;simply out of desperation\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;to look at the paintings on the walls of the room. I had of course approved these paintings and paid to have them refreshed and changed many a time. But now I took stock of them from my point of view not as Marius the rich man who can have whatever he wishes, but as Marius the monster painter who had rendered Pandora twenty-one times on the four walls of Akasha\u0027s shrine. I saw suddenly how inferior were these paintings, how rigid and pallid the goddesses and nymphs who peopled this world of my study, and quickly I woke my day slaves and told them that they must have everything covered over with fresh paint the following day. Also an entire supply of the best paints must be purchased and brought to the house. Never mind how the walls were to be redecorated. Leave that to me. Cover up all that was there. They were used to my eccentricities, and after making certain that they understood me, they went back to their sleep. I didn\u0027t know what I meant to do, except I felt driven to make pictures, and I felt if I can cling to that, if I can do that, then I can go on. My misery deepened. I laid out vellum for an entry in my erstwhile journal and began to describe the experience of discovering my beloved everywhere around me, and how it seemed to contain an element of sorcery when suddenly I heard an unmistakable sound. Avicus was at my gate. Indeed he was asking me with a strong current of the Mind Gift whether or not he might come over the wall and in to visit me. He was leery of the mortals in my banquet room and in my garden. But might he come in? At once I gave my silent answer that he could. It had been years since I had so much as glimpsed him in the back streets, and I was not entirely surprised to see him dressed as a Roman soldier, and to see that he had taken to carrying a dagger and a sword. He glanced fretfully at the door to the banquet room, but I gestured that he must pay the guests no attention at all. His rich curling dark hair was well groomed and clean and he had about him an attitude of prosperity and well-being, except that his clothes were dreadfully stained with blood. It was not human blood. I would have smelled human blood. He soon gave me to know by a simple facial expression that he was in dire distress. \"What is it? What can I do for you?\" I asked. I tried to cloak my pure loneliness, my pure need to touch his hand. You are a creature like me, I wanted to say. We are monsters and we can put our arms around each other. What are they, my guests, but tender things? But I said nothing at all. It was Avicus who spoke. \"Something dreadful has happened. I don\u0027t know how to correct it, or even if it can be corrected. I beg you to come.\" \"Come where, tell me,\" I said sympathetically. \"It\u0027s Mael. He\u0027s been grievously wounded and I don\u0027t know if the damage can be repaired.\" We went out at once. I followed him into a very crowded quarter of Rome where the newer buildings faced one another sometimes with no more than two feet in between. At last we came to a substantial new house on the outskirts, a rich dwelling, with a heavy gate, and he took me inside, through the entranceway and into the broad beautiful atrium or courtyard within the house. Let me note here that he was not using his full strength during this little journey, but I did not want to point this out to him, and so at his slow pace, I had followed his lead. Now, through the atrium, we passed into the main room of the house, the room where mortals would have dined, and there by the light of one lamp, I saw Mael lying in seeming helplessness on the tiled floor. The light was glinting in his eyes. I knelt beside him at once. His head was twisted awkwardly to one side, and one of his arms was turned as though the shoulder were out of joint. His entire body was hideously gaunt, and his skin had a dreadful pallor to it. Yet his eyes fixed on me with neither malice nor supplication. His clothes, very much like those of Avicus, hung loose on his starved frame, and were deeply soaked with blood. As for his long blond hair it was clotted with blood also, and his lips shivered as if he were trying to speak but could not. Avicus gestured to me helplessly with both hands. I bent closer to have a better look at Mael, while Avicus brought the oil lamp near and held it so that it cast a warm bright light. Mael made a low, harsh sound, and I saw gradually that there were horrid red wounds on his throat, and on his naked shoulder where the cloth of his tunic had been pushed out of the way. His arm was at the wrong angle to his body, most definitely, and his neck had been horribly twisted so that his head was not right. In a moment of exquisite horror, I realized that these parts of him\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; head and arm\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;had been shifted from their natural place. \"How did this happen?\" I asked. I looked up at Avicus. \"Do you know?\" \"They cut off his head and his arm,\" said Avicus. \"It was a band of soldiers, drunk and looking for trouble. We made to go around them, but they turned on us. We should have gone up over the roofs. We were too sure of ourselves. We thought ourselves so superior, so invincibly strong.\" \"I see,\" I answered. I clasped the hand of Mael\u0027s good arm. At once, he pressed my hand in return. In truth I was deeply shocked. But I could not let either of them see this, for it would only have made them more afraid. I had often wondered if we could be destroyed by dismemberment, and now the awful truth was plain to me. It was not sufficient alone to release our souls from this world. \"They surrounded him before I knew what to do,\" said Avicus. \"I fought off those who tried to harm me, but look what they have done to him.\" \"And you brought him back here,\" I said, \"and you tried to replace both head and arm.\" \"He was still living!\" said Avicus. \"They had run off, drunken, stumbling miscreants. And I saw at once that he was still alive. There in the street, though the blood poured out of him, he was looking at me! Why, he was reaching with his good arm for his own head.\" He looked at me as though begging me to understand him, or perhaps forgive him. \"He was alive,\" he repeated. \"The blood poured out of his neck, and it poured out of his head. In the street, I put the head on the neck. It was here that I joined the arm to the shoulder. And look what I have done.\" Mael\u0027s fingers tightened on my hand. \"Can you answer me?\" I said to Mael. \"Make only a sound if you cannot.\" There came that harsh noise again but this time I fancied I heard the syllable Yes. \"Do you want to live? \" I asked. \"Oh, don\u0027t ask him such a thing,\" Avicus begged. \"He may lack courage just now. Only help me if you know what to do.\" He knelt down beside Mael and he bent over, carefully holding the lamp to one side, and he pressed his lips to Mael\u0027s forehead. From Mael there had come that same answer again: Yes. \"Bring me more light,\" I said to Avicus, \"but understand before you do.I possess no extraordinary magic in this matter. I think I know what has happened and I know how to undo it. But that is all.\" At once Avicus gathered up from about the house a number of oil lamps and lighted them and set them down in an oval around Mael. It looked strangely like the work of a sorcerer marking off a place for magic, but I didn\u0027t let my thoughts become distracted by that annoying fact, and when I could finally see with the very best advantage I knelt down and looked at all the wounds, and I looked at the sunken, bloodless and skeletal figure of Mael. Finally I sat back on my heels. I looked at Avicus who sat opposite me on the other side of his friend. \"Tell me precisely how you accomplished this,\" I said. \"I fixed the head to the neck as best I could do it, but I was wrong, you see, I did it wrong. How can we know how to do it right?\" he demanded. \"Do you know?\" \"And the arm,\" I said, \"it\u0027s badly joined as well.\" \"What shall we do?\" \"Did you force the joining?\" I asked. He reflected before answering me. And then he said, \"Yes, I think I did. I see your meaning. I did it with force. I meant these parts to adhere once more. I used too much force.\" \"Ah, well, we have one chance to repair this, I think, but understand again I possess no secret knowledge. I take my lead from the fact that he is still living. I think we must pull off both head and arm and see if these parts, when placed in correct proximity to the body, will not join at the right angles as they should.\" His face brightened only as he slowly understood what I had said. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Perhaps they will join as they are meant to join! If they can join so poorly, they can join in a way that is perfect and right.\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"but you must do this act. You are the one he trusts.\" He looked down at his friend and I could see that this task would be no easy tiling. Then slowly he looked up at me. \"We must give him our blood first to strengthen him,\" he said. \"No, after it\u0027s done,\" I said, \"he\u0027ll need it for healing. That\u0027s when we\u0027ll give it.\" I disliked that I had given my word in this, but I realized quite abruptly that I didn\u0027t want to see Mael die. Indeed, so much did I not want to see it that I thought perhaps I ought to take over the entire operation myself. But I could not step in. It was up to Avicus how the matter went forward. Quite abruptly, he placed his left hand firmly on Mael\u0027s shoulder and pulled Mael\u0027s badly joined arm with all his strength. At once the arm was free of the body with bloody ligaments trembling from it rather like the roots of a tree. \"Now, place it close to him, there, yes, and see if it does not seek its own place.\" He obeyed me, but my hand was out to guide the arm quickly, not letting it get too close, but waiting for it to begin to move on its own. Abruptly I felt the spasm in the arm and then let go of it, and saw it quickly joined to the shoulder, the flying ligaments moving as so many little serpents into the body until the rupture was no more. Alas, I had been right in my suspicions. The body followed its own supernatural rules. At once, I cut my wrist with my teeth and I let my blood pour down on the wound. I saw it heal before my eyes. Avicus seemed rather amazed by this simple trick, though surely he must have known it, for this limited curative property of our blood is almost universally known among our kind. In a moment, I had given all that I wanted to give and the wound had all but disappeared. I sat back to see Mael\u0027s eyes fixed on me as before. His head looked pathetic and grotesque at its incorrect angle. And his expression was hideously empty. I felt his hand again, and the pressure was returned. \"Are you prepared to do it?\" I asked Avicus. \"Hold him well by the shoulders,\" Avicus answered. \"For the love of Heaven, use all your strength.\" I put my hands up, and caught Mael as firmly as I could. I would have rested my knees on his chest but he was far too weakened for such a weight and so I kept to one side. Finally with a loud moan, Avicus pulled on Mael\u0027s head with both his hands. The gush of blood was appalling, and I could swear that I heard the ripping of preternatural flesh. Avicus fell back with the gesture, and toppled to one side, holding the helpless head in his hands. \"At once, place it near to the body!\" I cried. I held the shoulders still, though the body had suddenly given a dreadful lurch. Indeed the arms flew up as if in search of the head. Avicus laid the head down in the gushing blood, pushing it ever closer to the gaping neck, until suddenly the head seemed to move of its own volition, the ligaments once more like so many little snakes as they made to meet with those of the trunk, and the whole body gave another lurch and the head was firmly fixed as it should have been. I saw Mael\u0027s eyes fluttering, and I saw his mouth open, and he cried out, \"Avicus,\" with all his strength. Avicus bent over him, cutting his wrist with his teeth as I had done before, only this time it was to let the stream come down into Mael\u0027s mouth. Mael reached for the arm above him, and he brought it down to him, drinking fiercely as his back arched, and his thin miserable legs quivered and went straight. I drew away from the pair, out of the circle of light. I sat still for a long while in the shadows, my eyes fixed on them, and then when I could see that Avicus was exhausted, that his heart was tired from giving so much blood, I crept to join the two, and I asked if I might give Mael to drink from me as well. Oh, how my soul revolted against this gesture. Why ever did I feel compelled to do it? I can give no answer. I don\u0027t know any more now than I knew at the time. Mael was able to sit up. His figure was more robust, but the expression on his face was too dreadful to behold. The blood on the floor was dried and glittering as our blood always is. It would have to be scraped up and burnt. Ala el leant forward and put his arms around me in a terrible intimacy and kissed me on the neck. He didn\u0027t dare to sink his teeth. \"Very well, do it,\" I said, though I was dreadfully hesitant, and I put in my mind images of Rome for him to see as he drank, images of beautiful new temples, Constantine\u0027s amazing triumphal arch, and all the wondrous churches which were now erected far and wide. I thought of Christians and their magical ceremonies. I thought of anything to disguise and obliterate all the secrets of my entire life. A miserable revulsion continued in me as I felt the pull of his hunger and his need. I refused to see anything of his soul with the Mind Gift, and I think my eyes met those of Avicus at one moment, and I was struck by the grave, complex expression on his face. Finally, it was all finished. I could give no more. It was almost dawn and I needed what strength I had to move quickly towards my hiding place. I rose to my feet. Avicus spoke up. \"Can we not be friends now?\" he asked. \"We have been enemies for so many, many years.\" Mael was still wretchedly afflicted from what had befallen him, and in no state perhaps to declare on the matter one way or the other, but he looked up at me with his accusing eyes, and said: \"In Egypt you saw the Great Mother, I saw her in your heart when I drank your blood.\" I went rigid with shock and fury. I thought I should kill him. He has been good only for learning\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; how to put together again blood drinkers who had been dismembered\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; and it was time now to finish what the drunkards only started earlier this night. But I said and did nothing. Oh, how cold was my heart. Avicus was dreadfully disappointed and disapproving. \"Marius, I thank you,\" he said, sad and weary as he walked me to the gate. \"What could I have done if you had refused to come to us? I owe you an immense debt.\" \"There is no Good Mother,\" I told him. \"I bid you farewell.\" As I hurried back over the rooftops of Rome, towards my own house, I resolved in my soul that I\u0027d told them the truth.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-6.html","bookId":2594,"book":{"id":2594,"title":"Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8)","description":"Storyline: Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8) Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice.
