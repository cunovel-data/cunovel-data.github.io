{"id":96710,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"8 I can\u0027t say that this awful chapter of our lives brought me together with Avicus and Mael. It was too dreadful, too against my nature, and too bitter for me. I went back to my house, and gladly resumed my painting. I rather enjoyed it that none of my guests ever wondered as to my true age, or why I didn\u0027t grow old or die. I think the answer lay in the fact that I had so very much company that no one could pay attention to any one thing for very long. Whatever it was, after the slaughter of the Satanic children, I wanted more music than before, and I painted more relentlessly and with greater invention and design. Meantime the state of the Empire was dreadful. It was now quite totally divided between East and West. In the West, which included Rome, of course, Latin was the language; while in the East the common language was Greek. The Christians too felt this sharp division and continued to quarrel over their beliefs. Finally the situation of my beloved city became intolerable. The Visigoth Ruler Alaric had taken the nearby port of Ostia, and was threatening Rome itself. The Senate seemed powerless to do anything about the impending invasion, and there was talk throughout the city that the slaves would side with the invaders, thereby bringing ruin on us all. At last, at midnight, the Salarian gate of the city was opened. There was heard the horrifying sound of a Gothic trumpet. And in came the rapacious hordes of Goths and Scythians to sack Rome herself. I rushed out into the streets to see the carnage all around me. Avicus was immediately at my side. Hurrying across the roofs, we saw everywhere that slaves had risen against their masters, houses were forced open, jewels and gold were offered up by frantic victims, who were nevertheless murdered, rich statues were heaped upon wagons in those streets large enough to allow such, and bodies soon lay everywhere as the blood ran in the gutters and as the inevitable flames began to consume all that they could. The young and the healthy were rounded up to be sold into slavery, but the carnage was often random, and I soon realized I could do nothing to help any mortal whom I saw. Returning to my house, I discovered with horror that it was already in flames. My guests had either been taken prisoner or had fled. My books were burning! All my copies of Virgil, Petronius, Apuleius, Cicero, Lucretius, Homer, Pliny were lying helpless amid the flames. My paintings were blackening and disintegrating. Foul smoke choked my lungs. I had scarce time to grab a few important scrolls. Desperately I sought for Ovid, whom Pandora had so loved, and for the great tragedians of Greece. Avicus reached out his arms to help me. I took more, seeking to save my own diaries, but in that fatal instant Goth soldiers poured into my garden with loud shouts, their weapons raised. At once I pulled my sword and began with fierce speed to decapitate them, shouting as they shouted, allowing my preternatural voice to deafen them and confuse them, as I hacked off random limbs. Avicus proved even more fierce than I was, perhaps being more accustomed to this kind of battle, and soon the band lay dead at our feet. But by now my house was completely engulfed in flames. The few scrolls we\u0027d sought to save were burning. There was nothing more to be done. I could only pray that my slaves had sought some refuge, for if they hadn\u0027t they would soon be taken for loot. \"To the chapel of Those Who Must Be Kept,\" I said. \"Where else is there to go?\" Quickly, we made to the roofs again, darting in and out of the blazes which everywhere lighted up the night sky. Rome was weeping; Rome was crying out for pity; Rome was dying. Rome was no more. We reached the shrine in safety, though Alaric\u0027s troops were pillaging the countryside as well. Going down into the cool confines of the chapel, I lighted the lamps quickly and then I fell down on my knees before Akasha, uncaring of what Avicus might think of such a gesture, and I poured out for her in whispered words the nature of this tragedy which had struck my mortal home. \"You saw the death of Egypt,\" I said reverently. \"You saw it become a Roman province. Well, now Rome dies in its turn. Rome has lasted for eleven hundred years and now it\u0027s no more. How will the world survive? Who will tend the thousands of roads and bridges that everywhere bring men and women together? Who will maintain the fabulous cities in which men and women thrive in safe houses, educating their youth to read and write and worship their gods and goddesses with ceremony? Who will drive back these accursed creatures who cannot farm the land which they have burnt and who live only to destroy!\" Of course there was no response from the Blessed Parents. But I fell forward and my hand went out to touch Akasha\u0027s foot. I breathed a deep sigh. And finally, forgetting all formality, I crept into the corner and sat rather like an exhausted boy. Avicus came to sit beside me. He clasped my hand. \"And what of Mael?\" I asked softly. \"Mael is clever,\" said Avicus. \"Mael loves to fight. He has destroyed many a blood drinker. Mael will never allow himself to be wounded as he was on that long ago night. And Mael knows how to hide when all is lost.\" For six nights we remained in the chapel. We could hear the shouts, the crying, as the looting and pillaging went on. But then Alaric marched out of Rome to wreak havoc on the countryside to the South. Finally the need for blood caused both of us to go back to the world above. Avicus bid me farewell and went in search of Mael, while I found myself in the street near my house, coming upon a soldier who was dying with a spear through his chest. He was no longer conscious. I removed the spear, which caused him to moan in his sleep, and then lifting him I opened my mouth over the gushing wound. The blood was full of scenes of the battle, and quite soon I had enough. I laid him aside, composing his limbs artfully. And then I discovered I was hungry for more. This time a dying man would not do. I walked on, stepping over rotted and stinking bodies, and passing the gutted ruins of houses, until I found an isolated soldier with a sack of loot over his back. He made to draw his sword, but quickly I overcame him, and bit into his throat. He died too soon for me. But I was satisfied. I let him fall at my feet. I then came upon my house utterly destroyed. What a sight was my garden where the dead soldiers lay swollen and reeking. Not a single book remained unburnt. And as I wept I realized with a cruel shock that all the Egyptian scrolls I possessed\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;all the early tales of the Mother and the Father\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; had perished in the fire. These were scrolls I had taken from the old temple in Alexandria on the very night I took the Mother and Father from Egypt. These were scrolls which told the old tale of how an evil spirit had entered into the blood of Akasha and Enkil, and how the race of blood drinkers had come about. All this was gone now. All this was ashes. All this was lost to me along with my Greek and Roman poets and historians. All this was gone along with all that I had written myself. It seemed quite impossible that such a thing had happened, and I faulted myself that I had not copied the old Egyptian legends, that I had not saved them in the shrine. After all, in some foreign marketplace I could find Cicero and Virgil, Xenophin and Homer. But the Egyptian legends? I would never recover the loss. I wondered: Would my beautiful Queen care that the written stories of her had perished? Would she care that I alone carried the tales in my mind and heart? I walked into the ruin of my rooms, and looked at the little that did still appear visible of the paintings on the blackened plaster walls. I looked up through the black timbers which might at any moment fall on me. I stepped over piles of burnt wood. At last I left the place where I had lived for so long. And as I went about, I came to see that the city was already rising from its punishment. Not all had been put to the torch. Rome was far too huge, with far too many buildings of stone. But what was it to me, this piteous sight of Christians rushing to help their brethren, and naked children crying for parents who were no more? So Rome had not been razed to the ground. It did not matter. There would come more invasions. These people who remained in the city, struggling to rebuild it, would endure a humiliation which I could not endure. I went back out to the chapel again. And going down the stairs, and into the sanctum, I lay in the corner, satiated and exhausted, and I closed my eyes. It was to become my first long sleep. Always in my life as an immortal I had risen at night and spent the allotted time which the darkness gave to me, either to hunt, or to enjoy whatever distractions or pleasures that I could. But now I paid no attention to the setting of the sun. I became like you, in your cave of ice. I slept. I knew I was safe. I knew Those Who Must Be Kept were safe. And I could hear too much of the misery from Rome. So I resolved that I would sleep. Perhaps I was inspired with the story of the Gods of the Grove, that they could starve in the oak for a month at a time, and still rise to receive the sacrifice. I\u0027m not sure. I did pray to Akasha. I prayed, \"Grant me sleep. Grant me stillness. Grant me immobility. Grant me silence from the voices that I hear so strongly. Grant me peace.\" How long was my slumber? Many months. And I began to feel the hunger terribly and to dream of blood. Yet stubbornly I lay on the floor of the shrine, eyes closed during the night when I might have wandered, deaf to intelligence of the outside world. I could not bear to see my beloved city again. I could think of nowhere to go. Then a strange moment came. In a dream, it seemed, Mael and Avicus were there, urging me to rise, offering me their blood for strength. \"You\u0027re starved, you\u0027re weak,\" said Avicus. How sad he looked. And how gentle he was. \"Rome is still there,\" he maintained. \"So it is overrun with Goths and Visigoths. The old Senators remain as always. They humor the crude barbarians. The Christians gather the poor to them and give them bread. Nothing can really kill your city. Alaric is dead, as if he succumbed to a curse for what he did, and his army long gone.\" Was I comforted by this? I don\u0027t know. I couldn\u0027t allow myself to wake. I could not open my eyes. I wanted only to lie where I was and be alone. They went away. There was nothing more for them to do. And then it seemed that they came at other times, that I would see them by the light of a lamp and that they would talk to me, but it was dreamlike and did not matter at all. Surely months passed, and then years. I felt light in all my limbs and only the Mind Gift seemed to have strength. A vision took hold of me. I saw myself lying in the arms of a woman, a beautiful Egyptian woman with black hair. It was Akasha, this woman, and she comforted me, she told me to sleep, and that nothing could hurt me, not even the thirst, because I had drunk her blood. I was not like other blood drinkers. I could starve and then rise again. I would not become fatally weak. We were in a splendid chamber with silk hangings. We lay on a bed, draped with silk so fine I could see through it. I could see golden columns with lotus leaves at their crowns. I could feel the soft cushions beneath me. But above all I could feel my comforter who held me firmly and warmly and told me to sleep. After a very long while I rose and went out into the garden and saw that, yes, it was the garden I had painted, only it had been perfected, and I turned round, trying to see the dancing nymphs only they were too quick for me. They were gone before I could see them, and in the distance the singing was too soft for me to hear. I dreamed of colors. I wanted the pots of paint before me, the pure colors so that I could make the garden come alive. Yes, sleep. At last a divine blackness settled over my mind and no thoughts whatsoever could penetrate. I knew that Akasha still held me because I could feel her arms around me and feel her lips against my cheek. That was all I knew. And the years passed. The years passed. Quite suddenly my eyes opened. A great sense of alarm came over me, giving me to know that I was a living being with a head and arms and legs. I didn\u0027t move, but I stared up into the darkness, and then I heard the sound of sharp footfalls, and a light blinded me for a moment. A voice spoke. It was Avicus. \"Marius, come with us,\" he said. I tried to rise from the stone floor but I couldn\u0027t do it. I couldn\u0027t lift my arms. Be still, I told myself and think on this matter. Think on what has happened. In the lamplight, Avicus stood before me once more holding the small flickering bronze lamp. He was dressed in a rich double tunic with an overshirt, rather like a soldier, and the trousers of the Goths. Mael stood beside him, finely dressed in similar garments, his blond hair swept back and cleanly combed, and all malice was gone from Mael\u0027s face. \"We\u0027re leaving, Marius,\" said Mael, his eyes wide and generous. \"Come with us. Stop this sleep of the dead and come.\" Avicus came down on one knee and put the light behind me so it wouldn\u0027t hurt my eyes any longer. \"Marius, we\u0027re going to Constantinople. We have our own ship for this journey, our own galley slaves to row it, our own pilot, and well-paid attendants who will not question our nocturnal disposition. You must come with us. There is no reason to remain.\" \"We must go,\" said Mael. \"Do you know how long you\u0027ve lain here?\" \"Half a century,\" I said in a small whisper, \"and during that time Rome has been laid waste again.\" Avicus shook his head. \"Far longer than that, old friend,\" he said, \"I can\u0027t tell you how many times we\u0027ve tried to wake you. Marius, the Western Empire is truly no more.\" \"Come with us to Constantinople,\" said Mael. \"She is the richest city in the world.\" \"Take my blood,\" said Avicus and he moved to bite into his wrist to give me to drink. \"We can\u0027t leave you behind.\" \"No,\" I said. \"Let me rise of my own accord.\" I wondered if they could hear my words, so softly were they spoken. I rose slowly on my elbows, and then I realized I was sitting up, and then I rose to my knees and to my feet. I was dizzy. My radiant Akasha, so erect on her throne, stared blindly past me. My King was unchanged. However both were covered with a layer of dust, and it seemed a crime unimaginable that they had been so neglected. The withered flowers were like so much hay in their dried vases. But for this who was to blame? Hesitantly I made my way to the dais. And then I closed my eyes. I felt Avicus catch me as obviously I\u0027d been about to fall. \"Leave me, please,\" I said quietly. \"Just for a little while. I must say my prayers for the comforts I\u0027ve received while sleeping. I\u0027ll join you soon.\" And vowing to stand more firmly I closed my eyes again. At once there came into my mind the vision of myself on the opulent bed within the extraordinary palace and Akasha, my Queen, embracing me. I saw the silk hangings wavering in the breeze. It was not my vision. That is, it had not come from me. Rather it had been given, and I knew it could only have come from her. I opened my eyes again and stared at her hard perfect face. Surely a woman less beautiful could never have endured so long. No blood drinker had ever had the courage to really destroy her. No blood drinker ever would. But my thoughts were confused suddenly. Avicus and Mael were still there. \"I\u0027ll come with you,\" I said to them, \"but for now, you must leave me here. You must wait for me above.\" At last they obeyed. I heard their steps as they went up the stairs. And then I mounted the steps of the dais and bent over my seated Queen once more, as reverently as ever, as bravely as ever, and I gave the kiss that might soon mean my death. Nothing stirred in the sanctuary. The Blessed Pair remained quiet. Enkil did not raise his arm to strike. I felt no motion in Akasha\u0027s body. I sank my teeth quickly. I drank deep draughts of the thick blood as fast as I could, and there came the vision of the sunlit garden again, lovely, full of flowering trees and roses, something made for a palace, where every plant is a part of an imperial design. I saw the bedchamber. I saw the golden columns. It seemed I heard a whisper: Marius. My soul expanded. I heard it again as if it were echoing through the silk-hung palace. The light in the garden brightened. Then, with a violent throb I realized I could take no more. I drew back. I saw the tiny puncture wounds contract and vanish. I pressed my lips to them and held the kiss for a long moment. On my knees I thanked her with my whole heart. I had not the slightest doubt that she had protected me in my sleep. I knew that she had. I knew also that she had caused me to wake. Avicus and Mael could have never done it without her divine intervention. She belonged to me more surely than when we had left Egypt. She was my Queen. And then I withdrew, powerful, clear-eyed, and ready for the long journey overseas to Byzantium. After all, I had Mael and Avicus to help me with the Divine Parents who must be secured in stone sarcophagi; and there would be many a long night at sea ahead of us during which I could weep for my beautiful Italy, my Italy which was lost.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-8.html","bookId":2594,"book":{"id":2594,"title":"Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8)","description":"Storyline: Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8) Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice.
