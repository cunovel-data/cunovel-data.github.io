{"id":96720,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"18\\n\\n LET ME EXPLAIN what this undertaking was to be: There was a chapel in Florence that existed within a Medici palazzo, and on the walls of this chapel was a great painting by a painter named Gozzoli of the Procession of the Magi\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the three wise men of Scripture\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;coming to visit the Christ Child with their precious gifts.\\n\\n Now it was a marvelous painting, full of rampant detail. And it was worldly in the extreme, in that the Magi themselves were clothed as wealthy Florentine citizens and there followed behind them a huge gathering of similarly clothed men and churchmen so that the whole was a tribute to the Christ Child and to the times in which the painting had been done.\\n\\n This painting covered the walls of this chapel, along with the walls of the recess for the place where its altar stood. And the chapel itself was quite small.\\n\\n Now I was taken with the painting for many reasons. I had not fallen deeply in love with Gozzoli as I had with Botticelli, but greatly admired him, and the details of this painting were fantastic in the extreme.\\n\\n Not only was the Procession itself enormous, if not actually never ending, but the landscape behind it was wondrous, filled with towns and mountains, with men hunting and animals running, with beautifully realized castles and delicately shaped trees.\\n\\n Well, choosing in my palazzo one of the largest rooms, I set out to duplicate this painting in the flat mode on one wall. What this meant was that I had to travel back and forth between Florence and Venice, memorizing parts of this painting, and then render it with all my supernatural skill.\\n\\n To a very large part I succeeded in my task.\\n\\n I \"stole\" the Procession of the Magi\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;this fabulous depiction of a procession so important to the Christians and especially to the Florentines and I laid it out in vivid and exact color on my wall.\\n\\n There was nothing original to it. But I had passed a test which I had set for myself, and as no one was to be admitted to this chamber, I did not fancy that I had truly robbed Gozzoli of anything he possessed. Indeed if any mortal had found his way into this chamber which I kept locked, I would have explained that the original of this painting was done by Gozzoli, and indeed when the time came for me to show it to my apprentices, for the lessons it contained, I did so explain.\\n\\n But let me return for a moment to the subject of this stolen work of art. Why did it appeal to me? What in it made my soul sing? I don\u0027t know. Except that it had to do with the three kings giving gifts, and I fancied that I was giving gifts to the children who lived in my house. But I\u0027m not sure if that is why I chose the painting for my first excursion into true work with the brush. I\u0027m not sure at all.\\n\\n Perhaps it was only that all the details of the work were so fascinating.\\n\\n One could fall in love with the horses in the Procession. Or with the faces of the young men. I shall now leave the subject as puzzled about it as I tell my story, as I was then.\\n\\n Immediately after confirming my success with the copy, I opened a spacious painting studio in the palazzo and began to work on large panels late at night while the boys slept. I did not really need their help and I did not want them to see the speed or the determination with which I worked.\\n\\n My first ambitious painting was dramatic and strange. I painted a gathering of my apprentices in full fancy dress listening to an old Roman philosopher who wore only his long tunic and cloak and sandals, and this against a backdrop of the ruins of Rome. It was full of vivid color and my boys were well rendered, I give myself that. But I didn\u0027t know if it was any good. And I didn\u0027t know if it would horrify.\\n\\n I left the door open to the studio in the hope that the teachers might wander in there by day.\\n\\n As it turned out they were far too timid to do it.\\n\\n I proceeded to create another painting, and this time I chose the Crucifixion\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;an approved theme for any artist\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and I rendered it with tender care\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and once again I used the backdrop of the ruins of Rome. Was it sacrilege? I couldn\u0027t guess. Once again, I was sure of my colors.\\n\\n Indeed, this time I was sure of my proportions, and of the sympathetic expression on Christ\u0027s face. But was the composition itself somehow something that should not be?\\n\\n How was I to know? I had all this knowledge, all this seeming power. Yet I didn\u0027t know. Was I creating something blasphemous and monstrous?\\n\\n I returned to the subject of the Magi. I knew the conventions. Three kings, the stable, Mary, Joseph, the Infant, Jesus, and this time I did them freely, imputing to Mary the beauty of Zenobia, and glorying in the colors as before.\\n\\n Soon my giant workroom was full of paintings. Some were correctly hung. Others were simply propped against the wall.\\n\\n Then one night, at supper to which I\u0027d invited the boys\u0027 more refined instructors, one of them, the Greek teacher, happened to mention that he had seen into my workshop through an open door.\\n\\n \"Oh, please, tell me,\" I said, \"what did you think of my paintings?\"\\n\\n \"Most remarkable!\" he said frankly. \"I\u0027ve never seen anything like them! Why, all of the figures in the painting of the Magi...\" He broke off, afraid.\\n\\n \"Please go on,\" I said instantly. \"Tell me. I want to know.\"\\n\\n \"All of the figures are looking out at us, including Mary, and Joseph, and the three kings. I have never seen it done in that way.\"\\n\\n \"But is it wrong?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he said quickly. \"But who\u0027s to say? You paint for yourself, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I do,\" I answered. \"But your opinion matters to me. I find at moments I\u0027m as fragile as glass.\"\\n\\n We laughed. Only the older boys were interested in this exchange, and I saw that the very oldest, Piero, had something to say. He too had seen the paintings. He had gone inside the room.\\n\\n \"Tell me everything, Piero,\" I said, winking at him, and smiling. \"Come on. What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"The colors, Master, they were beautiful! When will it be time for us to work with you? I\u0027m more skilled than you might think.\"\\n\\n \"I remember, Piero,\" I said, referring to the shop from which he\u0027d come. \"I\u0027ll call upon you soon enough.\"\\n\\n In fact, I called upon them the very next night.\\n\\n Having severe doubts about subject matter more than anything else, I resolved to follow Botticelli in that regard.\\n\\n I chose the Lamentation for my subject matter. And I made my Christ as tender and vulnerable as I could conceivably do it, and I surrounded him with countless mourners. Pagan that I was, I didn\u0027t know who was supposed to be there! And so I created an immense and varied crowd of weeping mortals\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;all in Florentine dress\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;to lament the dead Jesus, and angels in the sky torn with anguish much like the angels of the painter Giotto whose work I had seen in some Italian city the name of which I could not recall.\\n\\n My apprentices were quite astonished by the work and so were the teachers, whom I invited into the huge workroom for the initial view. Once again the faces I painted elicited special comment but so did the bizarre qualities of the painting\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the inordinate amount of color and gold\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and small touches I had added, such as insects here and there.\\n\\n I realized something. I was free. I could paint what I wanted. Nobody was going to be the wiser. But then again, I thought, perhaps dial\u0027s not true.\\n\\n It was desperately important for me to remain in the middle of Venice. I did not want to lose my foothold in the warm, loving world.\\n\\n I drifted out in the following weeks to all the churches once more in search of inspiration for my paintings, and I studied many a grotesque and bizarre picture which amazed me almost as much as my own work.\\n\\n An artist by the name of Carpaccio had created a work called Meditation on the Passion which revealed the body of the dead Christ end ironed against a fantastical landscape, and flanked by two white-haired saints who peered at the viewer as if Christ were not there!\\n\\n In the work of a painter named Grivelli, I found a truly grotesque picture of the dead Savior, flanked by two angels who looked like monsters. And the same painter had done a Madonna almost as lovely and lifelike as Botticelli\u0027s goddesses or nymphs.\\n\\n I arose night after night hungry not for blood, though I certainly fed when I had to feed, but for my time in the workshop, and soon my paintings, all of them on large wooden panels, were propped all over the enormous house.\\n\\n Finally, because I could keep track of them no longer, and went on to things new, rather than to perfect the old, I gave in to Vincenzo that he might have these works properly mounted as he wished.\\n\\n Meanwhile our whole palazzo, though it had become famous in Venice as \"a strange place,\" remained somewhat closed to the world.\\n\\n Undoubtedly my hired teachers spoke of their days and evenings in the company of Marius de Romanus, and all our servants gossiped, no question of it, and I did not seek to put an end to such talk.\\n\\n But I did not admit the true citizens of Venice. I did not lay put the banquet table as I had done in the old nights. I did not open the doors.\\n\\n Yet all the while I was longing to do it. I wanted the fashionable world of the city to be received under my roof.\\n\\n What I did instead of extending invitations was to accept those I received.\\n\\n Often in the early evening, when I didn\u0027t want to dine with my children, and long before I needed to begin painting furiously, I went to other palaces where feasting was in progress, and I entered, whispering my name when asked, but more often being received without question and discovering that the guests were eager to have me among them and had heard of my paintings and of my famous little school where the apprentices hardly did any work at all.\\n\\n Of course I kept to the shadows, spoke in vague but gentle words, read minds well enough to make the most clever conversation and in general almost lost my wits so great was this love to me, this convivial reception of me which was nothing more than most of the noblemen of Venice took for granted every night of their lives.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how many months passed in this way. Two of my students went on to Padua. I went out into the city and found four more. Vincenzo showed no signs of ill health. I hired new and better teachers from time to time. I painted fiercely. So on it went.\\n\\n Let me say a year or two had gone by before I was told of a very lovely and brilliant young woman who maintained a house always open to poets and playwrights and clever philosophers who could make their visits worth her while.\\n\\n Understand the payment in question was not a manner of money; it was that one had to be interesting to be admitted to this woman\u0027s company; poems had to be lyrical and meaningful; there had to be wit in conversation; one could play the virginal or the lute only if one knew how.\\n\\n I was fiercely curious as to the identity of this creature, and the general sweetness of the reports of her.\\n\\n And so passing her house, I listened, and I heard her voice threading through the voices of those around her, and I knew her to be a mere child, but one filled with anguish and secrets, all of which she concealed with immense skill behind a graceful manner and a beautiful face.\\n\\n How beautiful, I had no idea, until I mounted the steps, entered her rooms boldly and saw her for myself.\\n\\n When I came into the room, she had her back to me, and turned as if my arrival had made some noise which it had not. I saw her in profile and then completely as she rose to greet me, and I could not speak for a moment, so great was the impression on my mind of her form and face.\\n\\n That Botticelli hadn\u0027t painted her was a mere accident. Indeed he might well have done so. She looked so very like his women that all other thoughts left my mind. I saw her oval face, her oval eyes, and her thick wavy blond hair, interwound with long strings of tiny pearls, and the fine shape of her body with exquisitely molded arms and breasts.\\n\\n \"Yes, like Botticelli,\" she said, smiling as if I\u0027d spoken it.\\n\\n Again, I could say nothing. I was the one who read minds, and yet this child, this woman of nineteen pr twenty years seemed to have read mine. But did she know how much I loved Botticelli? That she could not know.\\n\\n She went on gaily, reaching out for my hand with both of hers.\\n\\n \"Everyone says it,\" she said, \"and I\u0027m honored. You plight say I dress my hair this way on account of Botticelli. You know I was born in Florence, but that\u0027s not worth talking about here in Venice, is it? You\u0027re Marius de Romanus. I was wondering how long it would be before you came.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you for receiving me,\" I said. \"I fear I come with nothing.\" I was still shocked by her beauty, shocked by the sound of her voice. \"What have I to offer you?\" I asked. \"I have no poems, nor clever stories about the state of things. Tomorrow, I shall have my servants bring you the best wine I have in my house. But what is that to you?\"\\n\\n \"Wine?\" she repeated. \"I don\u0027t want gifts of wine from you, Marius.\\n\\n Paint my picture. Paint the pearls interwound in my hair, I should love it.\"\\n\\n There was soft laughter all around the room. I gazed musingly at the others. The candlelight was dim even for me. How rich it all seemed, these naive poets and students of the classics, this indescribably beautiful woman, and the room itself with all the usual splendid trappings, and time passing slowly as though the moments had some meaning and were not a sentence of penitence and grief.\\n\\n I was in my glory. I realized it quite suddenly and then something else struck me.\\n\\n This young woman was in her glory too.\\n\\n Something sordid and evil lay behind her recent fortunes here, yet she displayed nothing of the desperation she must surely feel.\\n\\n I tried to read her mind and then I chose not to do it! I didn\u0027t want anything but this moment.\\n\\n I wanted to see this woman as she wanted me to see her\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;young, infinitely kind, yet utterly well defended\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a companion for the night\u0027s cheerful gatherings, mysterious mistress of her own house.\\n\\n Indeed, I saw another great drawing room adjacent to this one, and beyond it a marvelously decorated bedroom with a bed made of golden swans and gold-threaded silk.\\n\\n Why this display if not to tell everyone that in that bed, this woman slept alone? No one was ever to presume to cross that threshold, but all might see where the maiden retired of her own accord.\\n\\n \"Why do you stare at me?\" she asked me. \"Why do you look about yourself as if this is a strange place to you when surely it\u0027s not? \"\\n\\n \"All of Venice is lovely to me,\" I answered, making my voice soft and confidential so that it would not be for the whole room.\\n\\n \"Yes, isn\u0027t it?\" she said, smiling exquisitely. \"I too love it. I\u0027ll never return to Florence. But will you paint a picture of me?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps I will,\" I answered. \"I don\u0027t know your name.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not serious,\" she said, smiling again. I realized suddenly how very worldly she was. \"You didn\u0027t come here not knowing my name. How could you want me to believe such a thing?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, but I don\u0027t know it,\" I said, because I had never asked her name, and had learnt of her through vague images and impressions and fragments of conversation overheard by me as a blood drinker, and I stood at a loss because I wouldn\u0027t read her mind.\\n\\n \"Bianca,\" she said. \"And my rooms are always open to you. And if you paint my picture, I\u0027ll be in your debt.\"\\n\\n There were more guests coming. I knew that she meant to receive them. I backed away from her and took a station, so to speak, in the shadows well away from the candles, and from there I watched her, watched her infallibly graceful movements and heard her clever, ringing voice.\\n\\n Over the years, I had beheld a thousand mortals who meant nothing to me, and now, gazing at this one creature I felt my heart tripping as it had when I had entered Botticelli\u0027s workshop, when I had seen his paintings and seen him, Botticelli, the man. Oh, yes, the man.\\n\\n I stayed in her rooms only for a short time that night.\\n\\n But I returned within the week with a portrait of her. I had painted it on a small panel and had it framed with gold and jewels.\\n\\n I saw her shock when she received it. She had not expected something so exact. But then I feared she might see something wrong.\\n\\n When she looked at me, I felt her gratitude and her affection and something greater collecting inside her, an emotion she denied in dealing with others.\\n\\n \"Who are you ... really?\" she asked me in a soft, lilting whisper.\\n\\n \"Who are you ... really?\" I repeated, and I smiled.\\n\\n She looked at me gravely. Then she smiled too but she didn\u0027t answer, and all her secrets folded inside her\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the sordid things, things to do with blood and gold.\\n\\n For a moment, I thought my powerful self-control would be lost. I would embrace her, whether or not she would have it, and take her rapidly by force from the very middle of her warm and safe rooms to the cold and fatal domain of my soul.\\n\\n I saw her, positively saw her as if the Christian Satan were giving me visions once more\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;I saw her transformed by the Dark Blood. I saw her as if she were mine, and all her youth burnt out in sacrifice to immortality, and the only warmth or riches known to her those which came from me.\\n\\n I left her rooms. I couldn\u0027t remain there. For nights, no, months I did not return. In that time a letter came to me from her. I was quite astonished to receive it and I read it over and over and then put it in a pocket inside my tunic next to my heart.\\n\\n My dear Marius,\\n\\n Why leave me with only a brilliant painting when I would have your companionship as well? We are always seeking for amusement here, and there is much kind talk of you. Do come back to me. Your painting occupies a position of honor on the wall of my salon so that I might share the pleasure of it with all who come.\\n\\n How had this happened, this craving to make a mortal my companion?\\n\\n After so many centuries, what had I done to bring it on?\\n\\n I had thought that, with Botticelli, it had to do with his remarkable talent, and that I, with eyes so sharp and heart so hungry, had wanted to mingle the Blood with his inexplicable gift.\\n\\n But this child, Bianca, was no such seeming miracle, no matter how precious I found her to be. Oh, yes, she was to my taste as if I\u0027d made her\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the daughter of Pandora\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;it was as if Botticelli had created her, even to the somewhat dreamy expression of her face. And she did have a seemingly impossible mingling of fire and poise.\\n\\n But I had in my long miserable years seen many beautiful humans, rich and poor, younger and older, and I had not felt this sharp, near uncontrollable desire to bring her to me, to take her to the shrine with me, to spill out to her whatever wisdom I possessed.\\n\\n What was I to do with this pain? How should I be rid of it? How long would it torment me right here in the city of Venice where I had chosen to seek comfort from mortals and give back to the world in secret payment my blessed and well-educated boys?\\n\\n On rising, I found myself shaking loose light dreams of Bianca, dreams in which she and I were sitting in my bedroom and talking together as I told her of all the long lonely paths I\u0027d trod, talking together as she told me of how she had drawn from common and filthy pain her immeasurable strength.\\n\\n Even as I attended the feast with my students I couldn\u0027t shake off these dreams. They broke in on me as if I were falling asleep over the wine and meats. The boys vied for my attention. They thought they had failed the Master.\\n\\n When I went to my rooms to paint, I was equally confused. I painted a large picture of Bianca as the Virgin Mary with a chubby Infant Jesus. I laid down the brushes. I wasn\u0027t content. I couldn\u0027t be content.\\n\\n I went out of Venice into the countryside. I searched for the Evil Doer. I drank blood until I was glutted. And then I returned to my rooms, and I lay down on my bed and I dreamt of Bianca again.\\n\\n At last before dawn I wrote my admonitions down in my diary:\\n\\n This desire to make an immortal companion is no more justified here than it was in Florence. You have survived all your long life without ever taking this evil step, though you know well how to do it\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the Druid priest taught you how to do it\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and not doing it, you will continue to survive. You cannot bring over this child to you, no matter how you envision it. Imagine her to be a statue. Imagine your evil to be a force that would shatter that statue. See her then in fragments. Know that that is what you would do.\\n\\n I went back to her rooms.\\n\\n It was as if I\u0027d never seen her before, so great was her impression upon me, so soft and compelling her voice, so radiant her face and her worldly eyes. It was an agony and also an immeasurable consolation to be near her.\\n\\n For months I came to her rooms, pretending to listen to the poems recited, sometimes forced to answer in the gentle discussions regarding the theories of aesthetics or philosophy, but all the while simply wanting to be near her, studying the minutia of her beauty, closing my eyes now and then as I listened to the song of her voice.\\n\\n Visitors came and went from her famous gatherings. No one dared question her supremacy within her own domain. But as I sat, as I observed, as I let myself dream in the candlelight, there came to my observation something subtle and dreadful as ever I had beheld.\\n\\n Certain men who came into these rooms were marked for a dark and specific purpose. Certain men, well known to the divinely alluring mistress, received in their wine a poison which would follow them as they left the genial company and soon accomplish their deaths!\\n\\n At first, when I with my preternatural senses had smelled this subtle but certain poison I thought I had imagined such a thing. But then with the Mind Gift, I saw into the heart of this enchantress, and how she lured those whom she must poison, knowing little or nothing of why they had been condemned to death.\\n\\n This was the sordid lie I had first perceived in her. A kinsman, a Florentine banker, kept her in terror. Indeed it was he who had brought her here, provided her with her nest of lovely chambers and ever playing music. It was he who demanded of her that the poison be placed in the proper cup to do away with those he chose.\\n\\n HOW calmly her blue eyes passed over those who drank the fatal potion. How calmly she watched as the poetry was read to her. How calmly she smiled at me when her eyes happened to fall upon the tall blond-haired man who observed her from the corner. And how deep her despair!\\n\\n Armed with this new knowledge, no, driven to distraction by it, I went out into the night roaming, for now I had the proof on her of guilt immeasurable! Was this not sufficient to bring her over, to force the Dark Blood upon her, and then say, \"No, my darling, I haven\u0027t taken your life, I\u0027ve given you eternity with me!\"\\n\\n Beyond the city I walked the country roads for hours, sometimes pounding my forehead with the heels of my palms.\\n\\n I want her, I want her, I want her. But I could not bring myself to do it. At last I went home to paint her portrait. And night after night, I painted her portrait again. I painted her as the Virgin of the Annunciation, and the Virgin with Child. I painted her as the Virgin in the Lamentation. I painted her as Venus, as Flora, I painted her on small panels that I brought to her. 1 painted her until I could endure it no longer. I slumped on the floor of my painting room, and when the apprentices came to me in the dark hours of the dawn, they thought me sick and cried out.\\n\\n But I couldn\u0027t bring harm to her. I couldn\u0027t bring my Evil Blood to her. I couldn\u0027t take her over to me, and now a most great and grotesque quality attached itself to her in my eyes.\\n\\n She was evil as I was evil, and when I watched her from the corner of her room, I fancied that I studied a thing which was like unto myself.\\n\\n For her life, she dispatched her victims. For my life, I drank human blood.\\n\\n And so this tender girl, in her costly gowns with her long blond locks and soft cheeks, took on a dark majesty for me; and I was fascinated by her more than ever before.\\n\\n One night, so great was my pain, so dire was my need to separate myself from this young woman, that I went alone in my gondola, telling my oarsman to row back and forth through the smallest canals of the city and not bring me back to the palazzo until I gave the command.\\n\\n What did I seek? The smell of death and rats in the blackest waters, the occasional merciful flashes of the moon.\\n\\n I lay down in the boat, my head on my pillow. I listened to the voices of the city so that I would not hear my own.\\n\\n And quite suddenly, as we came into the wider canals again, as we came into a certain district of Venice, there came a voice quite different from all the others, for it was speaking from a desperate and deranged mind.\\n\\n In a flash I saw an image behind the cry of this voice, the image of a painted face. Indeed, I saw the paint laid on in marvelous strokes. I knew the painted face. It was the face of Christ!\\n\\n What did this mean? In a solemn silence, I listened.No other voice mattered to me. I banished a city full of whispers.\\n\\n It was a woeful crying. It was the voice of a child behind thick walls who on account of the recent cruelties done him could not remember his native language or even his name.\\n\\n Yet in that forgotten language he prayed to be delivered from those who had cast him down in darkness, those who had tormented him and jabbered at him in a tongue he didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n Once again there came that image, the painted Christ staring forward. The painted Christ in a time-honored and Greek style. Oh, how well I knew this fashion of painting; oh, how well I knew this countenance.\\n\\n Had I not seen it a thousand times in Byzantium, and in all those places East and West to which its power had reached?\\n\\n What did this mean, this mingled voice and imagery? What did it mean that the child thought again and again of an ikon and did riot know that he prayed?\\n\\n Once again there came the plea from one who thought himself to be utterly silent.\\n\\n And I knew the language in which he prayed. It was no matter to me to disentangle it, to put the words in order, having as I did such a knowledge of languages the world wide. Yes, I knew his tongue and I knew his prayer. \"Dear God, deliver me. Dear God, let me die.\"\\n\\n A frail child, a hungry child, a child who was alone.\\n\\n Sitting up in the gondola, I listened. I delved for the images locked away inside the child\u0027s most wordless thoughts.\\n\\n He had once been a painter, this bruised and young one. The face of Christ had been his work. He had once mixed the egg yolk and the pigment just as I mixed them. He had once painted the face of Christ, again and again!\\n\\n Whence came this voice? I had to discover the source of it. I listened with all my skill.\\n\\n Somewhere very near, this child was imprisoned. Somewhere very near, he offered up his prayer with his last breath.\\n\\n He had painted his precious ikons in the far country of snowy Russia.\\n\\n Indeed, this child had been supremely gifted in the painting of ikons. But he could not remember that now. That was the mystery. That was the complexity! He could not even see the images which I was seeing, so broken was his heart.\\n\\n I could understand what he himself could not understand. And he was pleading silently with Heaven in a Russian dialect to be delivered from those who had made him a slave in Venice and sought to make him serve others in a brothel through acts which to him were sins of the flesh which he could not abide!\\n\\n I told my oarsman to stop.\\n\\n I listened until I had found the exact source. I directed the boat to go back only a few doors until I found the precise place.\\n\\n The torches were burning brightly before the entrance. I could hear the music inside.\\n\\n The voice of the child was persistent, and yet there came that clear understanding on my part that the child did not know his own prayers, his own history, his own tongue.\\n\\n I was greeted by the owners of the house with great fanfare. They knew of me. I must come in. I could have whatever I wanted under their roof. Just beyond the door lay paradise. Listen to the laughter, and the singing.\\n\\n \"What do you desire, Master?\" a pleasant-voiced man asked of me. \"You can tell me. We have no secrets here.\"\\n\\n I stood listening. How reticent I must have seemed\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;this tall, blond-haired man with such a chilly manner, who cocked his head to one side and looked away with his thoughtful blue eyes.\\n\\n I tried to see the boy, but I could not. The boy was locked away where no one saw him. How would I proceed? Ask to see all of the boys of the house? That would not do it, for this one was in a chamber of punishment, cold and quite alone.\\n\\n Then suddenly the answer came to me as though angels had spoken it, or was it the Devil? It came swiftly and completely.\\n\\n \"To purchase, you understand,\" I said, \"with gold of course, and now, a boy you want to be rid of. One recently arrived here who will not do as he\u0027s told-\"\\n\\n In a flash I saw the boy in the man\u0027s eyes. Only it could not be true. I could not have such luck. For this boy had beauty as bountiful as Bianca\u0027s. I did not count upon it.\\n\\n \"Recently come from Istanbul,\" I said. \"Yes, I think that is correct, for the boy was no doubt brought from Russian climes.\"\\n\\n I need say no more words. Everyone was scurrying about. Someone had put a goblet of wine into my hands. I smelled the lovely scent of it, and set it down on the table. It seemed a flood of rose petals descended. Indeed there was everywhere the perfume of flowers. A chair was brought for me. I did not sit on it.\\n\\n Suddenly the man who had greeted me returned to the room.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want that one,\" he said quickly. He was greatly agitated. And once again, I saw a clear image of the boy lying on a stone floor.\\n\\n And I heard the boy\u0027s prayers: \"Deliver me.\" And I saw the Face of Christ in gleaming egg tempera. I saw the jewels set into the halo. I saw the egg and pigment mixing. \"Deliver me.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you understand me?\" I asked. \"I told you what I wanted. I want that boy, the one who won\u0027t do what you try to force him to do.\"\\n\\n Then I realized it.\\n\\n The brothel keeper thought the boy was dying. He was afraid of the law. He stood before me in terror.\\n\\n \"Take me to him,\" I said. I pressed him with the Mind Gift. \"Do it now. I know of him and won\u0027t leave here without him. Besides, I\u0027ll pay you. I don\u0027t care if he\u0027s sick and dying. Do you hear me? I\u0027ll take him away with me. You\u0027ll never have to worry about him again.\"\\n\\n It was a cruel small chamber in which they\u0027d locked him, and into that chamber the light of a lamp flooded upon the child.\\n\\n And there I saw beauty, beauty which has always been my downfall, beauty as in Pandora, as in Avicus, as in Zenobia, as in Bianca, beauty in a new and celestial form.\\n\\n Heaven had cast down upon this stone floor an abandoned angel, of auburn curls and perfectly formed limbs, of fair and mysterious face.\\n\\n I reached down to take him by the arms and I lifted him, and I looked into his half-opened eyes. His soft reddish hair was loose and tangled. His flesh was pale and the bones of his face only faintly sharpened by his Slavic blood.\\n\\n \"Amadeo,\" I said, the name springing to my lips as though the angels willed it, the very angels whom he resembled in his purity and in his seeming innocence, starved as he was.\\n\\n His eyes grew wide as he stared at me. In majesty and golden light, I saw again in his mind those ikons which he had painted. Desperately he struggled to remember. Ikons. The Christ he had painted. With long hair and burning eyes, I resembled the Christ.\\n\\n He tried to speak, but the language had left him. He tried to find the name of his Lord.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not the Christ, my child,\" I said, speaking to that part of him deep within the mind of which he knew nothing. \"But one who comes with his own salvation. Amadeo, come into my arms.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-18.html","bookId":2594,"book":{"id":2594,"title":"Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8)","description":"Storyline: Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8) \\n Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice. Thorne is a Northern vampire in search of Maharet, his \u0027maker\u0027, the ancient Egyptian vampire queen who holds him and others in thrall with chains made of her red hair, \u0027bound with steel and with her blood and gold\u0027. When the Visigoths sack his city, Marius is there; with the resurgence of the glory that was Rome, he is there, still searching for his lost love Pandora, but bewitched in turn by Botticelli, the Renaissance beauty Bianca, with her sordid secrets, and the boy he calls Amadeo (otherwise known as the Vampire Armand). Criss-crossing through the stories of other vampires from Rice\u0027s glorious Pantheon of the undead, haunted by Pandora and by his alter ego Mael, tracked by the Talamasca, the tale of Marius, the self-styled guardian of \u0027those who must be kept\u0027 is the most wondrous and mind-blowing of them all.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:53 PM"}}
