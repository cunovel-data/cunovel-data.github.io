{"id":96705,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"3\n IN A LARGE PAINTED WOODEN ROOM full of many painted cabinets and chests, Marius offered the clothes\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;fine leather jackets with small buttons of bone, many lined with silvery fur, and close-fitting pants of wool so soft Thorne couldn\u0027t see the weave of it.\n Only the boots were a little too small, but Thorne felt he could endure this. How could such a thing matter? Not satisfied, Marius continued to search until he found a large pair, and these proved more than serviceable.\n As for the costume of the times it wasn\u0027t so different from Thorne\u0027s old habit of dress\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;linen for the fine shirt next to the skin, wool and leather for the outer garments. The tiny buttons on the shirt intrigued Thorne, and though he knew that the stitching had been done by machines and was a common thing, nevertheless it delighted him.\n He had a dawning sense of how much delight awaited him. Never mind his dark mission.\n As Marius dressed, he chose red once more for his jacket and for his hooded cloak. It intrigued Thorne, though he had seen garments such as these on Marius in the vampire tavern. Nevertheless the colors seemed bright for hunting.\n \"It\u0027s my common way to wear red,\" Marius said to Thorne\u0027s unspoken interest. \"You do as you like. Lestat, my sometime pupil, also loves it which annoys me mightily but I endure it. I think we appear to be Master and Apprentice when his shade of clear red comes so close to mine.\"\n \"And so you love him as well?\" Thorne said.\n Marius said nothing. He gestured to the clothes.\n For Thorne, it was dark brown leather, more concealing, yet silken to the touch, and his feet went naked into the fur-lined boots on account of the size of them. He needed no cloak. He felt it would encumber him.\n From a silver dish on a cabinet, Marius took ashes on his fingertips, and mingling these with blood from his mouth, he made the thin paste to cover his face entirely. It darkened him; it made the old lines of his face appear. It gave a graven character to his eyes. In fact, it rendered him entirely more visible to Thorne while no doubt disguising him for mortals.\n Marius made a gesture that Thorne might do as well, but something prevented Thorne from accepting. Perhaps it was merely that he had never done this.\n Marius offered him gloves, but these he refused as well. He did not like the feel of things through gloves. After so long in the ice, he wanted to touch everything.\n \"I like gloves,\" said Marius. \"I\u0027m never without them. Our hands frighten mortals when they take the time to look. And gloves feel warm which we never do.\"\n Marius filled his pockets with paper money. He offered handfuls of this to Thorne, but Thorne refused, thinking it greedy to take this from his host.\n Marius said, \"It\u0027s all right. I\u0027ll take care of you. But if we become separated somehow, simply return here. Come round to the back of the house, and you\u0027ll find the door there open.\"\n Separated? How might that happen? Thorne was dazed by all that was taking place. The smallest aspect of things gave him pleasure.\n They were all but ready to take their leave when the young Daniel came in and stared at both of them.\n \"Do you want to join us?\" Marius asked. He was pulling his gloves very tight so that they showed his very knuckles.\n Daniel didn\u0027t answer. He appeared to be listening, but he said nothing. His youthful face was deceiving, but his violet eyes were truly wonderful.\n \"You know that you can come,\" said Marius.\n Within minutes they were on their way in the falling snow, Marius \u0027s arm around Thorne as though Thorne needed the reassurance. And I shall drink soon.\n The younger one turned and went back, presumably to his small kingdom.\n When they came at last to a large inn, it was into a cellar that they went where there were hundreds of mortals. Indeed the size of the room overwhelmed Thorne.\n Not only did glittering noisy mortals eat and drink in this place, in dozens of little groups, they danced to the music of several diligent players. At big green tables with wheels they played at games of chance with loud raucous cries and easy laughter. The music was electric and loud; the flashing lights were horrid, the smell of food and blood was overpowering.\n The two blood drinkers went utterly unnoticed, except for the tavern girl who accompanied them unquestioningly to a small table in the very midst of things. Here they could see the twisting dancers, who seemed one and all to be dancing alone rather than with anyone else, each moving to the music in a primitive way as though drunk on it.\n The music hurt Thorne. He didn\u0027t think it beautiful. It was like so much confusion. And the flashing lights were ugly.\n Marius leant over to whisper in Thorne\u0027s ear:\n \"Those lights are our friend, Thorne. They make it difficult to see what we are. Try to bear with them.\"\n Marius gave an order for hot drinks. The little tavern girl turned her bright flirtatious eyes on Thorne. She made some quick remark as to his red hair and he smiled at her. He wouldn\u0027t drink from her, not if all the other mortals of the world were dried up and taken away from him.\n He cast his eyes around the room, trying to ignore the din that pounded at his ears, and the overwhelming smells that almost sickened him.\n \"The women, see, near the far wall,\" said Marius. \"They want to dance. That\u0027s why they\u0027re here. They\u0027re waiting to be asked. Can you do it as you dance?\"\n \"I can,\" said Thorne almost solemnly, as if to say, Why do you ask me? \"But how do I dance?\" he asked, watching the couples who crowded the designated floor. He laughed for the first time since he\u0027d ever gone North. He laughed, and in the din he could barely hear his own laughter. \"I can drink, yes, without any mortal ever knowing it, even my victim, but how can I dance in this strange way?\"\n He saw Marius smile broadly. Marius had thrown his cloak back over the chair. He appeared so calm amid this awful unendurable combination of illumination and music.\n \"What do they do but move about clumsily together?\" Thorne asked.\n \"Do the same,\" said Marius. \"Move slowly as you drink. Let the music and the blood talk to you.\"\n Thorne laughed again. Suddenly with a wild bit of nerve he rose and made his way around the edges of the crowded dance floor to the women who were already looking eagerly towards him. He chose the dark-haired of the three, because women with dark eyes and dark hair had always fascinated him. Also she was the eldest and least likely to be chosen by a man, and he did not mean to leave her harmed by his interest.\n At once she rose, and he held her small limp hands in his and guided her out onto the polished floor, the relentless music suggesting nothing but an easy senseless rhythm, which she took up immediately and awkwardly, her fine delicate shoes clicking on the wood. \"Oh, but your hands are cold!\" she said.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry!\" he declared. \"You must forgive me. I\u0027ve been in the snow too long.\"\n Yea gods, he must be careful not to hurt her. What a simple trusting being she was, with her eyes and mouth sloppily painted, and her cheeks rouged, her breasts thrust forward and held in place by tight straps beneath her black silk dress.\n Boldly she pressed against him. And he, enfolding her as gently as he could, bent down to sink his tiny fangs most secretively into her neck. Dream, my precious one, dream of beautiful things. I forbid you to be afraid or to remember.\n Ah, the blood. After so long, it came, the blood pumped by her urgent little heart, her defenseless little heart! He lost the thread of her swoon and entered his own. He saw his red-haired Maker. And in a hushed moan he actually spoke aloud to the woman in his grip. Give me all. But this was wrong and he knew it.\n Quickly he pulled away, only to find that Marius stood beside him with a hand on his shoulder.\n As he let the woman go, she looked at him with glossy drowsy eyes, and he turned her in a rapid circle, laughing again, ignoring the course of blood through his veins, ignoring the weakness for more blood that overtook him. On and on they danced, as clumsy as the other couples. But he was so thirsty for more.\n At last she wanted to return to her little table. She was sleepy. She wouldn\u0026iexcl;\u0026macr;t think why. He must forgive her. He bowed and nodded, and he kissed her hand innocently.\n Only one woman of the trio remained. Marius was now dancing with the other. Thorne offered his hand to that last of the three women, and vowed that this time he would need no guardian.\n She was stronger than her friend. Her eyes were lined in black like an Egyptian, and she wore a deeper red on her lips, and her blond hair was full of silver.\n \"Are you the man of my dreams?\" she asked him, raising her voice boldly over the music. She would have taken him with her upstairs in the inn at this moment.\n \"Perhaps so,\" he said, \"if you let me kiss you,\" and caressing her tightly, he sank his teeth quickly into her neck, drinking hard and fast, and then letting her go, watching her drift and smile, cunning, yet sweet, unaware of what had happened to her.\n There was no getting much blood from these three. They were too gentle. Round and round he turned her in the dance, wanting desperately to steal another drink but not daring to do it.\n He felt the blood pounding inside him, but it wanted more blood. His hands and feet were now painfully cold.\n He saw that Marius was seated again at their table and talking to a hulking heavily dressed mortal who sat beside him. Marius had his arm over the creature\u0027s shoulder.\n Finally Thorne took the pretty woman back to her place. How tenderly she looked at him.\n \"Don\u0027t go,\" she said. \"Can\u0027t you stay with me?\"\n \"No, my dearest,\" he said. He felt the monster in him as he gazed down at her. And backing away, he turned and made his way to Marius.\n The music made him wobbly on his feet. How dreary it was, how persistent.\n Marius was drinking from the man as the man bent over near him as if listening to whispered secrets. At last Marius released him and righted him in his chair.\n \"It will take too many here,\" said Thorne.\n His words were inaudible in the din of the electric music but he knew that Marius could hear him.\n Marius nodded. \"Then we seek the Evil Doer, friend, and we feast,\" said Marius. He sat still as he scanned the room, as if listening to each and every mind.\n Thorne did the same, probing steadily with the Mind Gift, but all he could hear was the electric confusion of the music makers, and the desperate need of the pretty woman who still looked at him. How much he wanted her. But he could not take such an innocent creature, and his friend would forsake him if he did, and that was more important perhaps than his own conscience.\n \"Come,\" said Marius. \"Another place.\"\n Out into the night they went again. It was only a few short paces to a large gambling den, this one filled with the green tables on which men play the game of craps, and on which the wheels spun for the all-important winning numbers.\n \"There, you see,\" said Marius, pointing with his gloved finger at a tall gaunt black-haired young man who had withdrawn from the game, holding his cold glass of ale in his hand, only watching. \"Take him into the corner. There are so many places along the wall.\"\n Immediately Thorne went to it. With a hand on the young man\u0027s shoulder he looked into his eyes. He must be able now to use the old Spell Gift which so many blood drinkers were lacking. \"You come with me,\" he said. \"You\u0027ve been waiting for me.\" It reminded him of old hunts and old battles.\n He saw the mist in the young man\u0027s eyes, he saw the memory vanish. The young man went with him to the bench along the wall, and there they sat together. Thorne massaged the neck with thumb and fingers before he drank, thinking quietly within himself, Now your life will be mine, and then he sank his teeth deep and he drew easily and slowly with all his power.\n The flood poured into his soul. He saw the dingy images of rampant crime, of other lives snuffed out by his victim with no thought of judgment or punishment. Give me only your blood. He felt the heart inside the man burst. And then he released the body, and let it lie back against the wall. He kissed the wound, letting a bit of his own blood heal it.\n Waking from the dream of the feast, he gazed about the dim smoky room, so full of strangers. How alien all humans seemed, and how hopeless their plight. Cursed as he was, he could not die, but death was breathing on all of them.\n Where was his Marius? He couldn\u0027t find him! He rose from the bench, eager to get away from the victim\u0027s soiled and ugly body, and he moved into the press again, stumbling full on a hard-faced, cruel man who took the nudge as an opportunity for a quarrel.\n \"You pushing me, man?\" said the mortal with narrow hateful eyes as he gazed at Thorne.\n \"Come now,\" said Thorne, probing the mind, \"have you killed men just for pushing you?\"\n \"I have,\" said the other, his mouth in a cruel sneer. \"I\u0027ll kill you too, if you don\u0027t get out of here.\"\n \"But let me give you my kiss,\" said Thorne, and clutching this one by the shoulders he bent to sink his teeth as the others around him, totally unaware of the secret fangs, laughed at this intimate and puzzling gesture. He drew a rich draught.Then licked the place artfully\n The hateful stranger was baffled and weakened, and tottered on his feet. His friends continued to laugh.\n Quickly Thorne made his way out of the place and into the snow and there he found Marius waiting for him.The wind was stronger than before, but the snow itself had stopped falling.\n \"The thirst is so strong now,\" said Thorne. \"When I slept in the ice, I kept it like a beast chained up, but now it rules me.Once begun, I can\u0027t stop. I want more even now.\"\n \"Then more you\u0027ll have. But kill you can\u0027t.Not even in such a city as large as this. Come, follow me.\"\n Thorne nodded. He had already killed.He looked at Marius, confessing this crime silently. Marius shrugged his shoulders. Then he put his arm around Thorne as they walked on.\n \"We\u0027ve many places to visit.\"\n It was almost dawn when they returned to the house\n Down into the wood-lined cellar the went, and there Marius showed Thorne to a chamber cut into the stone.The walls of it were cold, but a large sumptuous bed had been made inside the chamber, hung with brightly colored linen draperies, and heaped with intricately sewn covers. The mattress looked thick and so did the many pillows.\n It was startling to Thorne that there was no crypt, no true hiding place. Anyone could find him here. It seemed as simple as his cave in the North, but far more inviting, far more luxurious. He was so tired in all his limbs that he could scarce speak. Yet he was anxious.\n \"Who is to disturb us here?\" asked Marius. \"Other blood drinkers go to their rest in this strange darkness just as we do. And there is no mortal who can enter here. But if you are afraid, I understand if we must seek some other shelter for you.\"\n \"Do you sleep in this way, unguarded?\" Thorne asked.\n \"Even more so, in the bedroom above, like a mortal man, sprawled on my mattress in the cabinet bed among my comforts. The only enemy who has ever harmed me was a swarm of blood drinkers. They came when I was fully awake and aware as must needs be. If you like, I shall tell you that awful story.\"\n Marius\u0027s face had gone dark, as though the mere mention of this disaster was evocative of terrible pain.\n And Thorne understood something suddenly. It was that Marius wanted to tell this story. Marius needed to speak in a long flow of words as much as Thorne needed to hear words. Marius and Thorne had come upon each other in the proper moment.\n But that would be tomorrow night. This night was ended.\n Marius drew himself up and went on with his reassurance.\n \"The light won\u0027t come as you know, and no one will trouble you here. Sleep and dream as you must. And we\u0027ll talk on the morrow. Now let me take my leave. Daniel, my friend, is young. He falls on the floor by his little empire. I have to make him retire to a comfortable place, though I wonder sometimes if it matters.\"\n \"Will you tell me one thing before you go? \" asked Thorne.\n \"If I can,\" said Marius gently, though suddenly he looked overwhelmingly hesitant. He looked as though he contained heavy secrets which he must tell and yet he feared to do it.\n \"The blood drinker who walked on the seashore,\" said Thorne, \"looking at the pretty shells one by one, what became of her?\"\n Marius was relieved. He gave Thorne a long look and then in careful words he answered.\n \"They said that she gave herself up to the sun. She was not so old. They found her one evening in the moonlight. She\u0027d drawn a great circle around herself of shells so they knew that her death was deliberate.\n There were only ashes there, and in fact, some had already been scattered by the wind. Those who loved her stood nearby and they watched as the wind took the rest. It was all finished by morning.\"\n \"Ah, what a dreadful thing,\" said Thorne. \"Had she no pleasure in being one of us?\"\n Marius seemed struck by Thorne\u0027s words. Gently he asked:\n Do you take any pleasure in being one of us?\"\n \"I think ... I think I do again,\" said Thorne hesitantly. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-3.html","bookId":2594,"book":{"id":2594,"title":"Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8) \n Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice.
