{"id":96730,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"28\n AS I LOOK BACK NOW, I have no doubt that Akasha turned me away from the rescue of Amadeo, and as I consider all that I have revealed here I have no doubt of her intervention in my life at other periods.\n Had I attempted to go South to Rome, I would have fallen into Santino\u0027s hands and met with destruction. And what better lure was there than the promise that I might soon meet with Pandora?\n Of course my encounter with Raymond Gallant was quite real, and the details of this were vivid within my mind, and Akasha no doubt subtracted these details by virtue of her immense power.\n The description of Pandora which I had confided to Bianca was also quite real, and this too might have been known to the Queen had she opened her ears to listen to my distant prayers from Venice.\n Whatever the case, from the night we arrived at the shrine I was set upon a course of recovery and of a search for Pandora.\n If anyone had told me that both would take some two hundred years, I might have met with despair, but I did not know this. I knew only that I was safe within the shrine, and I had Akasha to protect me, and Bianca to content me.\n For well over a year I drank from the fount of the Mother. And for six months of this time, I fed my powerful blood to Bianca.\n During those nights, when I could not open the stone door, I saw myself grow more robust in appearance with each divine feast, and I spent the long hours talking in respectful whispers with Bianca.\n We took to conserving the oil for the lamps, and the fine candles which I had stored behind the Divine Parents, for we had no inkling of how long it would be before I could open the door and take us to hunting in the distant Alpine towns or cities.\n At last there came a night when it occurred to me most strongly to venture out, and I was clever enough to know that this thought had not come to me at random. It had been suggested to me by a series of images. I could open the door now. I could go out. And I could take Bianca with me.\n As for my appearance to the mortal world, my skin was coal black, and heavily scarred in places as though from the stroking of a hot poker. But the face I saw in Bianca\u0027s mirror was fully formed, with the serene expression that has always been so familiar to me. And my body was strong once more, and my hands of which I am so vain were a scholar\u0027s hands with long deft fingers.\n For another year, I could not dare to send to Raymond Gallant a letter.\n Carrying Bianca with me to far-flung towns, I searched hastily and clumsily for the Evil Doer. As such creatures often run in packs, we would enjoy a gluttonous feast; and then I would take such clothes and gold as needed from the dead; and off we would go to the shrine well before daylight.\n I think when I look back on it that ten years at least went by in this fashion. But time is so strange with us, how can I be certain?\n What I remember was that a powerful bond existed between me and Bianca that seemed absolutely unshakable. As the years passed, she was as much my companion in silence as she had ever been in conversation.\n We moved as one, without argument or consultation.\n She was a proud and merciless hunter, dedicated to the majesty of Those Who Must Be Kept, and always drank from more than one human victim whenever possible. Indeed, there seemed no limit to the blood she could imbibe. She wanted strength, both from me and the Evil Doer whom she took with righteous coldness.\n Riding the winds in my arms, she turned her eyes to the stars fearlessly. And often she spoke to me softly and easily of her mortal life in Florence, telling me the stories of her youth, and of how she had loved her brothers who had so admired Lorenzo the Magnificent. Yes, she had seen my beloved Botticelli many a time and told me in detail of paintings which I had not seen. She sang songs to me now and then which she composed herself. She spoke in sadness of the death of her brothers and how she had fallen into the power of her evil kinsmen.\n I loved listening to her as much as I loved talking to her. Indeed, it was so fluid between us that I still wonder at it.\n And though on many a morn, she combed out her lovely hair and replaited it with her ropes of tiny pearls, she never complained of our lot, and wore the cast-off tunics and cloaks of the men we slew as I did.\n Now and then, slipping discreetly behind the King and Queen, she took from her precious bundle a gorgeous gown of silk and clothed herself with care in it, this to sleep in my arms, after I had covered her with warm compliments and kisses.\n Never had I known such peace with Pandora. Never had I known such warm simplicity.\n Yet it was Pandora who filled my mind\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;Pandora traveling the cities of the North, Pandora with her Asian companion.\n At last there came an evening when, after a furious hunt, in exhaustion and satiation, Bianca asked to be returned early to the shrine, and I found myself in possession of a priceless three hours before dawn.\n I also found myself in possession of a new measure of strength which I had perhaps unwittingly concealed from her.\n To a distant Alpine monastery I went, one which had suffered much due to the recent rise of what scholars call the Protestant Reformation. Here I knew I would find frightened monks who would take my gold and assist me in sending a letter to England.\n Entering the empty chapel first, I gathered up every good beeswax candle in the place, these to replenish those of the shrine, and I put all of the candles into a sack which I had brought with me.\n I then went to the scriptorium where I found an old monk who was writing very fast by his single candle.\n He looked up as soon as he found me standing in his presence.\n \"Yes,\" I said at once, speaking his German dialect. \"I am a strange man come to you in a strange way, but believe me when I say that I am not evil.\"\n He was gray-haired, tonsured, and wore brown robes, and he was a bit cold in the empty scriptorium. He was utterly fearless as he gazed at me.\n But I told myself that I had never looked more human. My skin was as black as that of a Moor and I wore the rather drab gray garments which I had taken from some doomed miscreant.\n Now as he continued to stare, quite obviously not in any mood to sound a general alarm, I did my old trick of placing before him a purse of gold coins for the good of the monastery which needed it badly.\n \"I must write a letter,\" I said, \"and see that it reaches a place in England.\"\n \"A Catholic place?\" he asked as he looked at me, his gray eyebrows thick and arched as he raised them.\n \"I should think so,\" I said with a shrug. Of course I couldn\u0027t describe to him the secular nature of the Talamasca.\n \"Then think again,\" he said. \"For England is no longer Catholic.\"\n \"What on earth do you mean?\" I asked. \"Surely the Reformation has not reached such a place as England.\"\n He laughed. \"No, not the Reformation precisely,\" he said. \"Rather the vanity of a King who would divorce his Spanish Catholic wife, and who has denied the power of the Pope to rule against him.\"\n I was so dejected that I sat down on a nearby bench though I\u0027d been given no invitation to do it.\n \"What are you?\" asked the old monk. He laid down his quill pen. He stared at me in the most thoughtful manner.\n \"It\u0027s no matter,\" I said wearily. \"Do you think there\u0027s no chance that a letter from here could reach a castle called Lorwich in East Anglia? \"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said the monk. \"It might well happen. For there are some who oppose King Henry VIII and others who do not. But in general he has destroyed the monasteries of England. And so any letter you write from me cannot go to one of them, only directly to the castle. And how is that to happen? We have to think on it. I can always attempt it.\"\n \"Yes, please, let us attempt it.\"\n \"But first, tell me what you are,\" he asked again. \"I won\u0027t write the letter for you unless you do so. Also I want to know why you stole all the good candles in the chapel and left the bad ones.\"\n \"You know I did this?\" I asked. I was becoming extremely agitated. I thought I had been silent as a mouse.\n \"I\u0027m not an ordinary man,\" he said. \"I hear things and see things that people don\u0027t. I know you\u0027re not human. What are you?\"\n \"I can\u0027t tell you,\" I said. \"Tell me what you think I am. Tell me if you can find any true evil in my heart. Tell me what you see in me.\"\n He gazed at me for a long time. His eyes were deeply gray, and as I looked at his elderly face I could easily reconstruct the young man he had been, rather resolute, though his personal strength of character was far greater now even though he suffered human infirmity.\n At last he turned away and looked at his candle as though he had completed his examination of me.\n \"I am a reader of strange books,\" he said in a hushed but clear voice. \"I have studied some of those texts which have come out of Italy pertaining to magic and astrology and things which are often called forbidden.\"\n My pulse quickened. This seemed extraordinary good fortune. I did not interrupt.\n \"I have a belief that there are angels cast out of Heaven,\" he said, \"and that they do not know what they are any longer. They wander in a state of confusion. You seem one of those creatures, though if I am right, you will not be able to confirm it.\"\n I was so struck by the curiosity of this concept that I could say nothing. At last I had to answer.\n \"No, I\u0027m not such. I know it for certain. But I wish that I were. Let me confide in you one terrible secret.\"\n \"Very well,\" he said. \"You may go to Confession to me if you like, for I am an ordained priest, not simply a monk, but I doubt I shall be able to give you Absolution.\"\n \"This is my secret. I have existed since the time when Christ walked the Earth though I never knew of him.\"\n He considered this calmly for a long time, looking into my eyes and then away to his candle, as if this were a little ritual with him. Then he spoke:\n \"I don\u0027t really believe you,\" he said. \"But you are a mystifying being, with your black skin and blue eyes, with your blond hair, and with your gold which you so generously put before me. I\u0027ll take it, of course. We need it.\"\n I smiled. I loved him. Of course I wouldn\u0027t tell him such a thing. What would it mean to him?\n \"All right,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll write your letter for you.\"\n \"I can write it myself,\" I said, \"if only you give me the parchment and the pen. I need for you to send it, and establish this place for the receipt of an answer to it. It\u0027s the answer which is so important.\"\n He obeyed me at once, and I turned to the task, gladly accepting the quill from him. I knew he was watching me as I wrote but it didn\u0027t matter.\n Raymond Gallant,\n I have suffered a dreadful catastrophe, following upon the very night which I met with you and talked to you. My palazzo in Venice was destroyed by fire, and I myself injured beyond my own imagining. Please be assured that this was not the work of mortal hands, and some night should we meet I shall most willingly explain to you what happened. In fact, it would give me great satisfaction to describe to you in detail the identity of the one who sent his emissaries to destroy me. As for now, I am far too weakened to attempt vengeance either in words or actions.\n I am also too weakened to journey to Lorwich in East Anglia, and thanks to forces which I cannot describe I do have shelter similar to that which you offered me.\n But I beg you to tell me if you have had any recent intelligence of my Pandora. I beg you to tell me if she has made herself known to you. I beg you to tell me if you can help me to reach her by letter. Marius.\n Having finished the letter, I gave it over to the priest who promptly added the proper address of the monastery, folded the parchment and sealed it.\n We sat in silence for a long moment.\n \"How shall I find you,\" he asked, \"when an answer reaches here?\"\n \"I\u0027ll know,\" I said, \"as you knew when I took the candles. Forgive me for taking them. I should have gone into a city and bought them from a proper merchant. But I have become such a traveler of the sleepy night. I do things far too much at random.\"\n \"So I can see,\" he answered, \"for though you began with me in German, you are now speaking Latin in which you wrote your letter. Oh, don\u0027t be angry. I didn\u0027t read a single word, but I knew it was Latin. Perfect Latin. A Latin such as no one speaks today.\"\n \"Is my gold recompense enough? \" I asked. I rose from the bench. It was now time for me to be off.\n \"Oh, yes, and I look forward to your return. I\u0027ll see the letter is sent tomorrow. If the Lord of Lorwich in East Anglia has sworn his allegiance to Henry VIII, you\u0027ll no doubt have your answer.\"\n I was off so swiftly that to my new friend, it no doubt seemed that I had disappeared.\n And as I returned to the shrine, I observed for the first time the beginnings of a human settlement all too close to us.\n Of course we were concealed in a tiny valley high upon an ominous cliff. Nevertheless, a small group of huts had caught my eye far below at the foot of the cliff, and I knew what was going to happen.\n When I entered the shrine I found Bianca sleeping. No question came from her as to where I had been, and I realized the lengths I had gone to avoid her knowledge of my letter.\n I wondered if I might reach England were I to travel the skies alone. But what would I say to her? I had never left her alone and it seemed wrong ever to do so.\n Little less than a year went by during which time I passed nightly within hearing distance of the priest to whom I had entrusted my letter.\n By this time, Bianca and I had frequently hunted the streets of small Alpine cities in one guise, while buying from their merchants in another.\n Now and then we rented rooms for ourselves so that we might enjoy common things, but we were far too fearful to remain anywhere but in the shrine at morning.\n All the while, I continued to approach the Queen at intervals. How I chose my moments, I do not know. Perhaps she spoke to me. All I can avow is that I knew when I might drink from her and I did it, and always there came the rapid healing afterwards, the renewal of vigor, and the desire to share my replenished gifts with Bianca.\n At last there came a night, when having left a weary Bianca in the shrine once more, I came near to the Alpine monastery and saw my monk standing in the garden with his arms out to the sky in a gesture of such romance and piety that I almost wept to see it.\n Softly, without a sound, I entered the cloister behind him.\n At once he turned to face me, as if his powers were as great as mine. The wind swept his full brown robes as he came towards me.\n \"Marius,\" he said in a whisper. He gestured to me to be quiet, and led me into the scriptorium.\n When I saw the thickness of the letter he drew from his desk I was astonished. That it was open, that the seal was broken, gave me pause.\n I looked at him.\n \"Yes, I read it,\" he said. \"Did you think I would give it to you without doing so?\"\n I couldn\u0027t waste any more time. I had to read what was inside the letter. I sat down and unfolded the pages immediately.\n Marius,\n Let these words not move you to anger or to hasty decision. What I know of Pandora is as follows. She has been seen by those of us who are knowledgeable in such things in the cities of Nuremberg, Vienna, Prague and Gutenberg. She travels in Poland. She travels in Bavaria.\n She and her companion are most clever, seldom disturbing the human population through which they move, but from time to time they set foot in the royal courts of certain kingdoms. It is believed by those who have seen them that they take some delight in danger.\n Our archives are filled with accounts of a black carriage that travels by day, comporting within two huge enameled chests in which these creatures are presumed to sleep, protected by a small garrison of pale-skinned human guards who are secretive, ruthless and devoted.\n Even the most benign or clever approach to these human guards is followed by certain death as some of our members have learnt for themselves when seeking to penetrate the mystery of these dark travelers.\n It is the judgment of some among us here that the guards have received a small portion of the power so generously enjoyed by their master and mistress, thus binding them irrevocably to Pandora and her companion.\n Our last sighting of the pair was in Poland. However these beings travel very fast and remain in no one place for any given length of time, and indeed seem more than content to move back and forth across the length and breadth of Europe ceaselessly.\n They have been known to go back and forth in Spain and to travel throughout France, but never to linger in Paris. As regards this last city, I wonder if you know why they do not stay there long, or if I must be the one to enlighten you.\n I shall tell you what I know. In Paris, now, there exists a great dedicated group of the species which we both understand, indeed, so large a group that one must doubt that even Paris can content them. And having received into our arms one desperate infidel from this group we have learnt much of how these unusual Parisian creatures characterize themselves.\n I cannot commit to parchment what I know of them. Let me only say that they are possessed of a surprising zeal, believing themselves to serve God Himself with their strenuous appetite. And should others of the same ilk venture into their domain they do not hesitate to destroy them, declaring them to be blasphemers.\n This infidel of which I speak has averred more than once that his brothers and sisters were among those who participated in your great loss and injury. Only you can confirm this for me, as I do not know what is madness here or boasting, or perhaps a blending of the two, and you can well imagine how confounded we are to have one so loquacious and hostile beneath our roof, so eager to answer questions and so frightened to be left unguarded.\n Let me also add that piece of intelligence which may matter to you as much now as any which I have pertaining to your lost Pandora.\n He who guides this voracious and mysterious band of Paris creatures is none other than your young companion from Venice.\n Won over by discipline, fasting, penance and the loss of his former Master\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;so says this young infidel\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;your old companion has proved to be a leader of immeasurable strength and well capable of driving out any of his kind who seek to gain a foothold in Paris.\n Would that I could tell you more of these creatures. Allow me to repeat what I have suggested above. They believe themselves to be in the service of Almighty God. And from this principle, a considerable number of rules follow.\n Marius, I cannot imagine how this information will affect you. I write here only that of which I am most certain.\n Now, allow me to play an unusual role, given our respective ages.\n Whatever your response to my revelations here, under no circumstances travel overland North to see me. Under no circumstances travel overland North to find Pandora. Under no circumstances travel overland North to find your young companion.\n I caution you on all these accounts for two reasons. There are at this time, as you must surely know, wars all over Europe. Martin Luther has fomented much unrest. And in England, our sovereign Henry VIII has declared himself independent of Rome, in spite of much resistance.\n Of course we at Lorwich are loyal to our King and his decisions earn only our respect and honor.\n But it is no time to be traveling in Europe.\n And allow me to warn you on another account which may surprise you. Throughout Europe now there are those who are willing to persecute others for witchcraft on slender reasons; that is, a superstition regarding witches reigns in villages and towns, which even one hundred years ago would have been dismissed as ridiculous.\n You cannot allow yourself to travel overland through such places. Writings as to wizards, Sabbats and Devil worship cloud human philosophy.\n And yes, I do fear for Pandora that she and her companion take no seeming notice of these dangers, but it has been communicated to us many times that though she travels overland, she travels very swiftly. Her servants have been known to purchase fresh horses twice or three times within a day, demanding only that the animals be of the finest quality.\n Marius, I send you my deepest good wishes. Please write to me again as soon as possible. There are so many questions I wish to ask you. I dare not do so in this letter. I do not know if I dare at all. Let me only express the wish and hope for your invitation.\n I must confess to you that I am the envy of my brothers and sisters that I have received your communication. I shall not let my head be turned by this. I am in awe of you and with justification.\n Yours in the Talamasca,\n Raymond Gallant.\n At last I sat back on the bench, the many sheaves of parchment trembling in my left hand, and I shook my head, hardly knowing what I might say to myself, for my thoughts were all a brew.\n Indeed, since the night of the disaster in Venice, I had frequently been at a loss for private words, and never did I know it as keenly as now.\n I looked down at the pages. My right fingers touched various words, and then I drew back, shaking my head again.\n Pandora, circling Europe, within my grasp but perhaps eternally beyond it.\n And Amadeo, won over to the creed of Santino and sent to establish it in Paris! Oh, yes, I could envision it.\n There came back to me once more the vivid image of Santino that night in Rome, in his black robes, his hair so vainly clean as he approached me and pressed me to come with him to his wretched catacomb.\n And here lay the proof now that he had not destroyed my beautiful child, rather he had made of him a victim. He had won him over; he had taken Amadeo to himself! He had more utterly defeated me than ever I had dreamt.\n And Amadeo, my blessed and beautiful pupil, had gone from my uncertain tutelage to that perpetual gloom. And yes, oh, yes, I could imagine it. Ashes. I tasted ashes.\n A cold shudder ran through me.\n I crushed the pages to myself.\n Then quite suddenly I became aware that, beside me sat the gray-haired priest, looking at me, very calm as he leaned on his left elbow.\n Again I shook my head. I folded the pages of the letter to make of them a packet that I might carry with me.\n I looked into his gray eyes.\n \"Why don\u0027t you run from me?\" I asked. I was bitter and wanted to weep but this was no place for it.\n \"You\u0027re in my debt,\" he said softly. \"Tell me what you are, if only so that I may know if I\u0027ve lost my soul by serving you.\"\n \"You haven\u0027t lost your soul,\" I said quickly, my wretchedness too plain in my voice. \"Your soul has nothing to do with me.\" I took a deep breath. \"What did you make of what you read in my letter?\"\n \"You\u0027re suffering,\" he said, \"rather like a mortal man, but you aren\u0027t mortal. And this one in England, he is mortal, but he isn\u0027t afraid of you.\"\n \"This is true,\" I said. \"I suffer, and I suffer for one has done me wrong and I have no vengeance nor justice. But let\u0027s not speak of such things. I would be alone now.\"\n A silence fell between us. It was time for me to go but I had not the strength quite yet to do it.\n Had I given him the usual purse? I must do it now. I reached inside my tunic and brought it out. I laid it down, and spilled the golden coins so that I might see them in the light of the candle.\n Some vague and heated thoughts formed in my mind to do with Amadeo and the brilliance of this gold and of how angry I was, and of how I seethed for vengeance against Santino. I saw ikons with their halos of gold; I saw the coin of the Talamasca made of gold. I saw the golden florins of Florence.\n I saw the golden bracelets once worn by Pandora on her beautiful naked arms. I saw the golden bracelets which I had put upon the arms of Akasha.\n Gold and gold and gold.\n And Amadeo had chosen ashes!\n Well, I shall find Pandora once more, I thought. I shall find her! And only if she swears against me will I let her go, will I let her remain with this mysterious companion. Oh, I trembled as I thought of it, as I vowed, as I whispered these wordless thoughts.\n Pandora, yes! And some night, for Amadeo, there would be the reckoning with Santino!\n A long silence ensued.\n The priest beside me was not frightened. I wondered if he could possibly guess how grateful I was that he allowed me to remain there in such precious stillness.\n At last, I ran my left fingers over the golden coins.\n \"Is there enough there for flowers?\" I asked, \"flowers and trees and beautiful plants in your garden?\"\n \"There is enough there to endow our gardens forever,\" he answered.\n \"Ah forever!\" I said. \"I have such a love of that word, forever.\"\n \"Yes, it is a timeless word,\" he said, raising his mossy eyebrows as he looked at me. \"Time is ours, but forever belongs to God, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"Yes, I do,\" I said. I turned to face him. I smiled at him, and I saw the warm impression of this on him just as if I\u0027d spoken kind words to him. He couldn\u0027t conceal it.\n \"You\u0027ve been good to me,\" I said.\n \"Will you write to your friend again?\" he asked.\n \"Not from here,\" I answered. \"It\u0027s too dangerous for me. From some other place. And I beg you, forget these things.\"\n He laughed in the most honest and simple way. \"Forget!\" he said.\n I rose to go.\n \"You shouldn\u0027t have read the letter,\" I said. \"It can only cause you worry.\"\n \"I had to do it,\" he answered. \"Before I gave it to you.\"\n \"I cannot imagine why,\" I answered. I walked quietly towards the door of the scriptorium.\n He came beside me.\n \"And so you go then, Marius?\" he asked.\n I turned around. I lifted my hand in farewell.\n \"Yes, neither angel nor devil, I go,\" I said, \"neither good nor bad. And I thank you.\"\n As I had before, I went from him so swiftly he couldn\u0027t see it, and very soon I was alone with the stars, and staring down on that valley all too near to the chapel where a city was forming at the foot of my high cliff which had been neglected by all mankind for over a millennium. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-28.html","bookId":2594,"book":{"id":2594,"title":"Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8) \n Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice.
