{"id":96725,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"23 No MATTER how long we exist, we have our memories\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; points in time which time itself cannot erase. Suffering may distort my backward glances, but even to suffering, some memories will yield nothing of their beauty or their splendor. Rather they remain as hard as gems. So it is with me and the night of Bianca\u0027s most supreme feast, and indeed I call it that because it was Bianca who created it, merely using the wealth and rooms of my palazzo for her finest achievement in which all the apprentices participated and in which even humble Vincenzo was given a dramatic role. All of Venice did come to partake of our never ending banquet, and to delight in the singing and the dancing, whilst the boys performed in numerous and grandly staged tableaux. It seemed that every room had its own singers or divine pageants. The music of the lute, the virginal, and a dozen other instruments blended to make the lovely songs that lulled and enchanted everyone, as the younger boys, royally costumed, went about filling cups from golden pitchers of wine. And Amadeo and I did dance ceaselessly, stepping carefully and gracefully as was the fashion then\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;one walked to music, really\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; clasping hands with many a Venetian beauty as well as our beloved genius of the whole affair. Many a time, I snatched her away from the illumination of the candles and told her how dear to me she was that she could bring about such magic. And I begged from her a promise that she might do it again and again. But what could compare to this night of dancing and wandering amid mortal guests who commented gently and drunkenly on my paintings, sometimes asking me why I had painted this or that? As in the past, no critical word struck my heart deeply. I felt only the loving heat of mortal eyes. As for Amadeo, I watched over him constantly, and saw only that he was divinely happy, seeing all this splendor as a blood drinker, divinely thrilled by the theatricals in which the boys played wonderfully designed roles. He had taken my advice and continued in his love of them, and now amid the blazing candelabra and the sweet music, he was radiant with happiness and whispered in my ear when he could that he could ask for nothing finer than this night. Having fed early, and far away, we were warm with blood and keen of vision. And so the night belonged to us in our strength and in our happiness, and the magnificent Bianca was ours and ours only as all men seemed to know. Only as sunrise approached did the guests begin to take their leave, with the gondolas lined up before the front doors, and we had to break from the duty of accepting farewells to find our own way to the safety of our gold-lined grave. Amadeo embraced me before we parted to lie in our coffins. \"Do you still want to make the journey to your homeland?\" I asked him. \"Yes, I want to go there,\" he said quickly. He looked at me sadly. \"I wish I could say no. On this night of all nights, I wish I could say no.\" He was downcast, and I would not have it. \"I\u0027ll take you.\" \"But I don\u0027t know the name of the place. I can\u0027t\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;.\" \"You needn\u0027t torture yourself on that account,\" I said. \"I know it from all you\u0027ve told me. It\u0027s the city of Kiev, and I shall take you there very soon.\" There came a look of bright recognition to his face. \"Kiev,\" he said and then he said it in Russian. He knew now it was his old home. The following night I told him the story of his native city. Kiev had once been magnificent, its cathedral built; to rival Hagia Sophia in Constantinople from which its Christianity had come. Greek Christianity had shaped its beliefs and its art. And bodi had flourished beautifully there in a wondrous place. But centuries ago, the Mongols had sacked this grand city, massacred its population, destroying forever its power, leaving behind some accidental survivals, among them monks who kept to themselves. What remained of Kiev? A miserable place along the banks of the Dnieper River where the cathedral still stood, and the monks still existed in the famous Monastery of the Caves. Quietly, Amadeo listened to this intelligence and I could see the pure misery in his face. \"All through my long life,\" I said, \"I have seen such ruin. Magnificent cities are created by men and women with dreams. Then there come the riders of the North or the East and they trample and destroy the magnificence; all that men and women have created is no more. Fear and misery follow this destruction. And nowhere is it more visible than in the ruins of your home\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;Kiev Rus.\" I could see that he was listening to me. I could sense that he wanted me to continue to explain. \"There exists now in our beautiful Italy a land that will not be sacked by those warriors, for they no longer menace the northern or eastern borders of Europe. Rather they long ago settled into the continent and became the very population of France and Britain and Germany today. Those who would still pillage and rape have been pushed back forever. Now throughout Europe what men and women can do in cities is being discovered again. \"But in your land? There is still sorrow, and bitter poverty. The fertile grasslands are useless\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;thousands of miles of them are useless! Save for the occasional hunter as mad as your father must have been. That is the legacy of Genghis Khan\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a monster.\" I paused. I was becoming too heated. \"The Golden Horde is what they call that land, and it is a wasteland of beautiful grass.\" He nodded. He saw the sweep of it. I knew this from his solemn eyes. \"Would you still go?\" I pressed him. \"Would you still revisit the place where you suffered so much?\" \"Yes,\" he whispered. \"Though I do not remember her, I had a mother. And without my father, there might be nothing for her. Surely he died that day when we rode out together. Surely he died in the hail of arrows. I remember the arrows. I must go to her.\" He broke off as though struggling to remember. He groaned suddenly as though some sharp physical pain had humbled him. \"How colorless and grim is their world.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Let me take them only a small amount\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;.\" \"Make them rich if that\u0027s your wish.\" For a long moment, he was silent and then he made a small confession, murmuring it as though he were communing with himself: \"I must see the monastery where I painted the ikons. I must see the place where at times I prayed I would have the strength to be walled up alive. You know it was the way of the place, don\u0027t you? \" \"Very well, I know it,\" I answered. \"I saw it when I gave you the Blood. I saw you moving down the corridors, giving sustenance to those who still lived in their cells, half immured and waiting for the will of God to take them as they starved themselves. They asked you when you would have the courage for it, yet you could paint ikons that were magnificent.\" \"Yes,\" he said. \"And your father hated them that they did not let you paint, that they made you a monk above all things.\" He looked at me as if he had not truly understood this until now, and perhaps he had not. And then came from his lips a stronger statement. \"So it is with any monastery, and you know it, Master,\" he retorted. \"The will of God comes first.\" I was faintly shocked by the expression on his face. Was he speaking to his father or to me? It took us four nights to reach Kiev. I could have made the journey much more quickly had I been on my own, but I carried Amadeo close to me, his head bowed, his eyes closed, my fur-lined cloak wrapped around him to shelter him from the wind as best I could. At last on the sunset of the fifth night, we reached the ruins of the city which had once been Kiev Rus. Our clothes were covered in dirt and our fur cloaks dark and nondescript, which would help to render us unremarkable to mortal eyes. A thick snow lay over the high abandoned battlements, and covered the roofs of the Prince\u0027s wooden palace, and beneath the battlements simple wooden houses that ran down to the Dnieper River\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the town of Podil. Never have I seen a place more forlorn. As soon as Amadeo had penetrated the wooden dwelling of the European ruler, and glimpsed to his satisfaction this Lithuanian who paid tribute to the Khan for his power, he wanted to move on to the monastery at once. And into it he slipped using his immense blood drinker\u0027s skill to play the shadows and confuse those who might have seen him as he cleaved to the mud walls. I was near to him always but it was not my place to interfere or instruct. Indeed, I was gripped with horror, for the place seemed infinitely worse than I had ever guessed from the probing of his fevered mind. With quiet misery, he saw the room in which he\u0027d made ikons with its tables and pots of paints. He saw the long mud corridors through which he\u0027d walked once as a young monk, giving food and drink to those half buried alive. At last he came out of it, shivering, and he clung to me. \"I would have perished in a mud cell,\" he whispered, looking at me, begging me to understand the import of it. His face was twisted with pain. Then turning away swiftly, he went down towards the half-frozen river, searching for the house in which he\u0027d been born. With no difficulty he found it, and he entered it\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the splendid Venetian, dazzling and confusing the family gathered there. Once again I kept my distance, settling for the silence and the wind, and the voices I could hear with preternatural ears. Within moments he had left them with a fortune in gold coin and come out again into the falling snow. I reached out to take his arm and comfort him. But he turned away. He wouldn\u0027t look at me. Something obsessed him, \"My mother was there,\" he whispered, as he looked down once more towards the river. \"She didn\u0027t know me. So be it. I gave them what I had to give.\" Again I tried to embrace him, but he shook me off. \"What\u0027s wrong then?\" I asked. \"Why do you stare? Why do you look that way towards the river? What would you do? \" How I wished I could read his mind! His mind, and his alone, was shut to me! And how angry and determined he looked. \"My father wasn\u0027t killed in the grasslands,\" he said, his voice quavering, the wind whipping his auburn hair. \"My father is alive. He\u0027s in the tavern down there.\" \"You want to see him?\" \"I have to see him. I have to tell him that I didn\u0027t die! Didn\u0027t you listen to them talking in my house to me?\" \"No,\" I said- \"I gave you your time with them. Was I wrong?\" \"They said he\u0027d become the drunkard because he had failed to save his son.\" He glared at me as if I had done him some dreadful wrong. \"My father, Ivan, the brave one, the hunter. Ivan, the warrior, the singer of songs whom everyone loved\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;Ivan is the drunkard now because he failed to save his son!\" \"Be calm. We\u0027ll go to the tavern. You can tell him in your own way\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;-.\" He waved me off as though I were annoying him, and he set off down the street with a mortal tread. Together we entered the tavern. It was dark and full of the scent of burning oil. Fishermen, traders, killers, drank here together. Everyone took notice of us for a moment and then ignored us, but Amadeo at once spied a man lying on a bench to the back of the rectangular room which made up the place. Again, I wanted to leave him to what he meant to do, but I feared for him and I listened as he sat down now close to this sleeping man. It was the man of memory and the man of visions, that I knew, as soon as I studied him. I recognized him by his red hair and red mustache and beard. Amadeo\u0027s father, the hunter who had taken him out of the monastery that day for a dangerous mission, to ride out in search of a fort which the Mongols had already destroyed. I shrank back into the shadows. I watched as the luminous child removed his left glove and laid his chill supernatural hand upon the forehead of the sleeping father. I saw the bearded man wake. I heard them speak. In rambling drunken confession, the father gave forth his guilt in abundance as though it belonged to anyone who roused him. He had shot arrow after arrow. He had gone after the fierce Tatars with his sword. Every other man in the party had died. And his son, my Amadeo, stolen, and he was now Ivan the Drunkard, yes, he confessed it. He could scarcely hunt enough to buy his drink. He was a warrior no more. Patiently, slowly, Amadeo spoke to him, pulling him out of his ramblings, revealing the truth with carefully chosen words. \"I am your son, sir. I did not die that day. Yes, they took me. But I am alive.\" Never had I seen Amadeo so obsessed with either love or misery, with either happiness or grief. But the man was stubborn, the man was drunk, and the man wanted one thing from this strange person prodding him and that was more wine. From the proprietor I bought a bottle of sack for this man who wouldn\u0027t listen, who wouldn\u0027t look at this exquisite young one who sought to claim his attention now. I gave the bottle of sack to Amadeo. Then I moved along the wall so that I might better see Amadeo\u0027s face, and all I saw there was obsession. He must make this man understand. Patiently, he spoke until his words had penetrated the drunken haze from which the man stared at him. \"Father, I\u0027ve come to tell you. They took me to a far-away place, to the city of Venice, and I fell into the hands of one who made me rich, Father, rich, and gave me learning. I\u0027m alive, sir. I\u0027m as you see me now. Oh, how strange was this speech coming from one infused with the Blood. Alive? How so, alive, Amadeo? But my thoughts were my own in the darkness. I had no role in this reunion. At last, the man, sitting up to face his son, began to understand. Amadeo was trembling, his eyes fixed on those of his father. \"Forget me now, please, Father,\" he begged. \"But remember this, for the love of God. I shall never be buried in the muddy caves of the monastery. No. Other things may happen to me, but that, I won\u0027t suffer. Because of you, that you wouldn\u0027t have it, that you came that day and demanded I ride out with you, that I be your son!\" What on earth was Amadeo saying? What did these words mean? He was on the verge of crying the terrible blood tears which we can never really hide. But as he rose from the bench where his father sat, the elder caught him tightly by his hand. He knew his son! Andrei, he called him. Fie had recognized him for who he was. \"Father, I must go,\" said Amadeo, \"but you must never forget that you saw me. You must never forget what I said, that you saved me from those dark and muddy caves. Father, you gave me life, not death. Don\u0027t be the drunkard anymore, Father. Be the hunter again. Bring the Prince meat for his table. Be the singer of songs. Remember that I came to tell you this myself.\" \"I want you, my son, stay with me,\" said the man. His drunken languor had left him, and he held tight to Amadeo\u0027s hand. \"Who will ever believe that I saw you?\" Amadeo\u0027s tears had risen. Could the man see the blood? At last Amadeo pulled back, and removing his glove, he pulled off his rings, and he placed these in his father\u0027s hands. \"Remember me by these,\" he said, \"and tell my mother that I was the man who came to see her tonight. She didn\u0027t know me. Tell her the gold is good gold.\" \"Stay with me, Andrei,\" said the father. \"This is your home. Who is it that takes you away now? \" It was more than Amadeo could bear. \"I live in the city of Venice, Father,\" he said. \"It\u0027s what I know now I have to go.\" He was out of the tavern so quickly his father could not see it, and I, once seeing what he meant to do, had preceded him, and we stood in the snow-covered muddy street together. \"It\u0027s time for us to leave this place, Master,\" he said to me. His gloves were gone, and the cold was fierce. \"Oh, but that I had never come here and never seen him and never known that he suffered that I had been lost.\" \"But look,\" I said, \"your mother comes. I\u0027m sure of it. She knew you and there, she comes,\" I pointed at the small figure approaching who held a bundle in her arms. \"Andrei,\" she said as she drew closer. \"It\u0027s the last one you ever painted. Andrei, I knew it was you. Who else would have come? Andrei, this is the ikon your father brought back on the day you were lost.\" Why didn\u0027t he take it from her hands? \"You must keep it, Mother,\" he said of this ikon which he had once linked to his destiny. He was weeping. \"Keep it for the little ones. I won\u0027t take it, no.\" Patiently, she accepted this. And then another small present she entrusted to him, a painted egg\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;one of those treasures of Kiev which mean so much to the people who decorate them with intricate designs. Quickly, gently, he took it from her, and then he embraced her, and in a fervent whisper assured her that he had done nothing wicked to acquire his wealth and that he might some night be able to come again. Oh, what lovely lies. But I could see that this woman, though he loved her, did not matter to him. Yes, he would give her gold, for that meant nothing. But it was the man who had mattered. The man mattered as the monks had mattered. It was the man who had wrung the strong emotions from him. The man had brought from him bold words. I was stunned by all. But wasn\u0027t Amadeo stunned by it himself? He had thought the man dead, and so had I. But finding him alive, Amadeo had revealed the obsession\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the man had fought the monks for Amadeo\u0027s very soul. And as we made our journey back to Venice, I knew that Amadeo\u0027s love for his father was far greater than any love he had ever felt for me. We did not speak of it, you understand, but I knew that it was the figure of his father who reigned in Amadeo\u0027s heart. It was the figure of that powerful bearded man who had so vigorously fought for life rather than death within the monastery who held supremacy over all conflicts that Amadeo was ever to know. I had seen it with my own eyes, this obsession. I had seen it in a matter of moments in a riverfront tavern, but I had known it for what it was. Always before this journey to Russia I had thought the split in Amadeo\u0027s mind was between the rich and varied art of Venice and the strict and stylized art of old Russia. But now I knew that was not so. The split in him was between the monastery with its ikons and its penance on the one hand, and his father, the robust hunter who had dragged him away from the monastery on that fateful day. Never again did Amadeo speak of his father and mother. Never again did he speak of Kiev. The beautiful painted egg he placed within his sarcophagus without ever explaining its significance to me. And on certain nights when I painted in my studio, working fiercely on this or that canvas, he would come to keep me company, and it seemed he perused my work with new eyes. When would he finally pick up the brushes and paint? I didn\u0027t know, but such a question didn\u0027t matter anymore. He was mine and mine forever. He could do what he pleased. Yet silently in my secret soul, I suspected that Amadeo held me in contempt. All I taught of art, of history, of beauty, of civilization\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;all this was meaningless to him. When the Tatars captured him, when the ikon fell from his arms into the grass, it was not his fate that was sealed; it was his mind. Yes, I could dress him in finery and teach him different languages, and he could love Bianca, and dance with her exquisitely to slow and rhythmic music, and he could learn to talk philosophy, and write poetry as well. But his soul held nothing sacred but that old art and that man who lay drinking out his nights and days by the Dnieper in Kiev. And I, with all my power, and all my blandishments, could not replace Amadeo\u0027s father in Amadeo\u0027s mind. Why was I so jealous? Why did this knowledge sting me so much? I loved Amadeo as I had loved Pandora. I loved him as I had loved Botticelli. Amadeo was among these, the great loves of my long life. I tried to forget my jealousy or ignore it. After all, what was to be done about it? Should I remind him of this journey and torment him with questions? I could not do such a thing. But I sensed that these concerns were dangerous to me as an immortal, and that never before had anything of this nature so tortured me or made me weak. I had expected Amadeo, the blood drinker, to look upon his family with detachment and no such thing had taken place! I had to admit that my love for Amadeo was all caught up with my involvement with mortals, that I had plunged myself into their company, and he himself was still so very hopelessly close to them that it would take him centuries to gain the distance from mortals which I had experienced on the very night when I was first given the Blood. There had been no Druid grove for Amadeo. There had been no treacherous journey to Egypt; there had been no rescue of the King and Queen. Indeed, as I mulled this over quickly I resolved I would not entrust him with the mystery of Those Who Must Be Kept even though the words had once or twice passed my lips. Perhaps before the making of him, I had thought idly that I would take him to the shrine at once. I would beg Akasha to receive him, as she had once received Pandora. But now I thought otherwise. Let him be more advanced; let him be more nearly perfected. Let him become more wise. And was he not company and consolation for me now more than I ever dreamt? Even if a bad mood overtook him he remained with me. Even if his eyes were dull as though the dazzling colors of my paintings did not matter to him, was he not near at hand? Yes, he was quiet for a time after the journey to Russia. But I knew his frame of mind would pass. And indeed it did. Within a few short months, he was no longer aloof and moody but had come back to be my companion, and was once again visiting the various feasts and balls of the great citizens which I attended regularly, and writing short poems for Bianca, and arguing with her about various paintings which I had done. Ah, Bianca, how we loved her. And how often did I search her mind to make certain that she had no inkling even now that we were not human beings. Bianca was the only mortal I admitted to my studio, but naturally I could not work with my full speed and force when she was there. I had to lift a mortal arm to hold the paintbrush but it was more than worth it to hear her pleasant commentary with Amadeo who also perceived in my works some grand design which was not there. All was going well when, one night as I came down upon the roof of the palazzo, quite alone, for I had left Amadeo in the company of Bianca, I sensed that a very young mortal was watching me from the roof of the palazzo across the canal. Now I had come down so swiftly that not even Amadeo could have seen it had he been watching, yet this distant mortal marked my presence and when I realized it, I realized quite a deal more as well. Here was a mortal spy who suspected me to be other than human. Here was a mortal spy who had been observing me for some time. Never in all my years had I known any such a threat to my secrecy. And naturally I was tempted to immediately conclude that my life in Venice had failed. Just when I thought I had fooled an entire city, I was to be caught for what I was. But this young mortal had nothing to do with the grand society in which I moved. I knew it the moment I penetrated his mind. He was no great Venetian, no painter, no cleric, no poet, no alchemist, and certainly no member of the Grand Council of Venice. On the contrary, he was a most strange sort of being, a scholar of the supernatural, a spy upon creatures such as me. What could this mean? What could this be? At this point, meaning to confront him and terrify him, I came to the very edge of the roof garden and peered across the canal at him, and there I made out his stealthy shape, and how he meant to cloak himself, and how fearful yet fascinated he was. Yes, he knew me to be a blood drinker. Indeed, he had some name for me: vampire. And he had been watching me for several years! He had in fact glimpsed me in grand salons and ballrooms, so I might indeed write this off to my carelessness. And on the night that I had first opened my house to the citizens of Venice, he had come. All this his mind gave me rather easily without the young man realizing it, obviously, and then using the Mind Gift I sent a very direct message to him. This is folly. Interfere with me and you will surely die. I won\u0027t give you a second warning. Move away from my household. Leave Venice. Is it worth your life to know what you want to know of me? I saw him visibly startled by the message. And then to my pure shock I received a distinct mind message from him: We mean you no harm. We are scholars. We offer understanding. We offer shelter. We watch and we are always here. Then he gave way to utter fear and fled the roof. With little difficulty I heard him make his way down the staircases through the palazzo and then I saw him come out into the canal and hail a gondola which took him away. I had caught a good look at him as he stepped into the boat. He was a tall man, lean and fair of skin, an Englishman, and he was dressed in severe clothes of black. He was very frightened. He did not even look up as the boat took him away. I stood on the roof for a long time, feeling the blessed wind, and wondering in its silence, what I should do about this strange discovery. I thought over his distinct message and the power of mind with which he\u0027d sent it to me. Scholars? What sort of scholars? And the other words. How very remarkable indeed. I cannot exaggerate how odd this was. It struck me with full force that there had been moments in my long life when I would have found his message irresistible, so great had been my loneliness, so great had been my longing to be understood. But now, with all of Venice receiving me into its finest company, I did not feel such a thing. I had Bianca when I wanted to ramble on about the work of Bellini or my beloved Botticelli. I had Amadeo with whom to share my golden tomb. Indeed, I was enjoying a Perfect Time. I wondered if for every immortal there was a Perfect Time. I wondered if it corresponded to the prime of life in mortals\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;those years when you are strongest and can see with the greatest clarity, those years when you can give your trust most truly to others, and seek to bring about a perfect happiness for yourself. Botticelli, Bianca, Amadeo\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;these were the loves of my Perfect Time. Nevertheless, it was a stunning promise, that which the young Englishman had made. \"We offer understanding. We offer shelter. We watch and we are always here.\" I resolved to ignore this, to see what came of it, not to allow it to impede me in the slightest as I enjoyed my life. Yet in the weeks that followed I listened for this strange creature, this English scholar, and indeed, I kept a sharp lookout for him as we made our way through the usual lavish and dizzying social events. I also went so far as to question Bianca about such a person, and to warn Vincenzo that such a man might attempt to engage him in conversation and that he must be very wise on that account. Vincenzo shocked me. The very fellow\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a tall lean Englishman, young, but with pale gray hair\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;had already come calling. He had questioned Vincenzo, Would his Master wish to purchase certain unusual books? \"They were books of magic,\" said Vincenzo, frightened that I would be angry. \"I told him that he must bring the books if he meant to offer them to you, and leave them here for you to see.\" \"Think back on it. What more was said between you?\" \"I told him you had many, many books already, that you visited the booksellers. He ... he saw the paintings in the portego. He asked if these had been done by you.\" I tried to make my voice comforting. \"And you told him that the paintings had been done by me, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, sir, I\u0027m sorry, so very sorry if this was more than I should have said. He wanted to purchase a painting. I told him that no purchase could be made.\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter. Only be careful on account of this man. Tell him nothing further. And when you see him, report it at once to me.\" I had turned to go when a question came to me and I turned to see my beloved Vincenzo in tears. Of course I reassured him at once that he had served me perfectly, and told him he must worry about nothing. But then I asked him: \"Give me your impression of this man. Was he good or bad?\" \"Good, I think,\" he said, \"though what sort of magic he meant to sell, I don\u0027t know. Yes, good, I would say so, very good, though why I say it I can\u0027t tell. He had a kindness to him. And he liked the paintings. He praised them. He was most polite and rather serious for one so young. Rather studious.\" \"It\u0027s quite enough,\" I said. And indeed it was. I did not find the man though I searched the city. And I had no fear. Then two months later, I met, in the most auspicious circumstances, with the man himself. It was at a luxurious banquet and I was seated at the table, among a great number of drunken Venetians watching the young people before us in their measured and leisurely dance. The music was poignant, and the lamps were just brilliant enough to give the vast room the most enchanting glow. There had been several fine spectacles before with acrobats and singers, and I think I was faintly dazed. I know I was thinking again that this was my Perfect Time. I meant to write it in my diary when I returned home. As I sat at the table, I leant on my right elbow, my left hand playing idly with the rim of a cup from which I now and then pretended to drink. And then and there appeared this Englishman, this scholar, at my left side. \"Marius,\" he said softly, and in full command of classical Latin: \"Count me a friend and not a meddler, I beg you. I have watched you for a long time from afar.\" I felt a deep shiver. I was startled in the purest sense of the word. I turned to look at him, and saw his sharp clear eyes fixed fearlessly on me. Again there came that message, mentally, without words, from his mind quite confidently to my own: We offer shelter. We offer understanding. We are scholars. We watch and we are always here. Once again a deep shiver stole over me. All the company round was blind to me, but this one saw. This one knew. Now he passed to me a round gold coin. On it was stamped one word: Talamasca I looked it over, concealing my complex shock, and then I asked politely in the same classical Latin: \"What does it mean?\" \"We are an Order,\" he said, his Latin effortless and charming. \"That is our name. We are the Talamasca. We are so old we don\u0027t know our origins and why we are so called.\" He spoke calmly. \"But our purpose in every generation is clear. We have our rules and our traditions. We watch those whom others despise and persecute. We know secrets that even the most superstitious of men refuse to believe.\" His voice and his manners were very elegant, but the power of the mind behind his words was quite strong. His self-possession was stunning. He could not have been more than twenty. \"How did you find me?\" I demanded. \"We watch at all times,\" he said gently, \u0027\u0027and we saw you when you lifted your red cloak, as it were, and stepped into the light of torches and the light of rooms such as this.\" \"Ah, so, it began for you then in Venice,\" I said. \"I have blundered.\" \"Yes, here in Venice,\" he said. \u0027\u0027One of us saw you and wrote a letter to our Motherhouse in England, and I was dispatched to make certain of who and what you were. Once I glimpsed you in your own house I knew it to be true.\" I sat back and took his measure. He had put on handsome velvet of a fawn color, and wore a cloak lined with miniver, and there were simple silver rings on his hands. His pale ashen hair was long and combed plainly. His eyes were as gray as his hair. His forehead was high and bare of lines. He seemed to be shining clean. \"And what truth is this that you speak of?\" I asked as gently as I could. \"What is it that you know to be true of me?\" \"You are a vampire, a blood drinker,\" he said without flinching, his voice as polite as ever, his manner composed. \"You\u0027ve lived for centuries. I can\u0027t know your age. I don\u0027t presume to know. I wish that you would tell me. You have not blundered. It is I who have come to greet you.\" It was charming to be speaking in the old Latin. And his eyes, reflecting the light of the lamps, were full of an honest excitement tempered only by his dignity. \"I have come into your house when it was open,\" he said. \"I have accepted your hospitality. Oh, what I would give to know how long you\u0027ve lived, and what you have seen.\" \"And what would you do with that intelligence?\" I asked him, \"If I did tell you such things?\" \"Commit it to our libraries. Increase the knowledge. Let it be known that what some say is legend is in fact truth.\" He paused and then he said: \"Magnificent truth.\" \"Ah, but you have something to record even now, don\u0027t you?\" I asked. \"You can record that you have seen me here.\" Quite deliberately I looked away from him and towards the dancers before us. Then I looked back at him to see that he had followed, obediently, the direction of my gaze. He watched Bianca as she made her circle in the carefully modulated dance, her hand clasped by that of Amadeo who smiled at her, the light glimmering on his cheek. She seemed the girl again when the music played so very sweetly, and when Amadeo gazed on her with such approving eyes. \"And what else do you see here?\" I asked, \"my fine scholar of the Talamasca?\" \"Another,\" he answered, his eyes returning to me without fear. \"A beautiful boyish one, who was human when I first laid eyes on him, and now he dances with a young woman who may soon be transformed as well.\" My heart beat furiously as I heard this. My heart beat in my throat and in my ears. But he laid no judgment down upon me. On the contrary, he was without all judgment and for a moment I could do nothing but search his young mind to make certain this was true. He shook his head gently. \"Forgive me,\" he said. \"I have never been close to one such as you.\" He was flushed suddenly. \"I have never spoken to one such as you. I pray I shall have time to commit to parchment what I\u0027ve seen tonight, though I swear to you on my honor and on the honor of the Order that if you let me go from here alive I will write nothing until I reach England, and the words will never do you harm.\" I shut the soft seductive music out of my hearing. I thought only of his mind, and I searched it and found there nothing but what he had just said to me, and behind it, an Order of scholars as he had described it, a seeming wonder of men and women who wanted only to know, and not to destroy. Indeed a dozen marvels presented themselves of shelter given to those who could genuinely read minds, and others who from the cards could somehow with uncanny accuracy predict fortunes, and some who might have been burnt as witches, and behind it libraries in which time-honored books of magic were stored. It seemed quite impossible that in this Christian era, such a secular force could exist. I reached down and picked up the gold coin with the engraved word, Talamasca. I put it in one of my pockets, and then I took his hand. He was fiercely afraid now. \"Do you think I mean to kill you?\" I asked gently. \"No, I don\u0027t think you will do it,\" he said. \"But you see, I have studied you so long and with such love, I can\u0027t know.\" \"Love, is it?\" I asked. \"How long has your Order known of creatures like us?\" I asked. I held his hand firmly. His high clear forehead was suddenly creased by a small expressive frown. \"Always, and I told you we are very old.\" I thought on it for a long moment, holding on to his hand. I searched his mind again, and found no lie in it. I looked out at the young dancers moving decorously, and I let the music fill me once more as though this strange disturbance had never come about. Then I released his hand slowly. \"Go then,\" I said, \"leave Venice. I give you a day and a night to do it. For I would not have you here with me.\" \"I understand,\" he said gratefully. \"You have watched me too long,\" I said reprovingly. But the reproof was really for myself. \"I know that you have already written letters to your Motherhouse describing me. I know because I would have done so if I were you.\" \"Yes,\" he said again, \"I have studied you. But I have done it only for those who would know more of the world and all its creatures. We persecute no one. And our secrets are well kept from those who would use them for harm.\" \"Write what you will,\" I said, \"but go, and never suffer your members to come to this city again.\" He was about to rise from the table when I asked him his name. As so often happened with me, I had not been able to take it from his mind. \"Raymond Gallant,\" he responded softly. \"Should you ever want to reach me\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;.\" \"Never,\" I said sharply under my breath. He nodded, but then refusing to go with that admonition he stood his ground and said: \"Write to the castle, the name of which is engraved on the other side of the coin.\" I watched him leave the ballroom. He wasn\u0027t a figure to attract attention, and indeed one could picture him working with quiet dedication in some library where everything was splattered with ink. But he did have a marvelously appealing face. I sat brooding at the table, only talking now and then to others when I had to, wondering on it, that this mortal had come so close to me. Was I too careless now? Too absolutely in love with Amadeo and Bianca to be paying attention to the simplest things that should have sounded an alarm? Had the splendid paintings of Botticelli separated me too much from my immortality? I didn\u0027t know, but in truth what Raymond Gallant had done could be explained fairly well. I was in a room full of mortals and he was but one of them, and perhaps he had a way of disciplining his mind so that his thoughts did not go out before him. And there was no menace to him in gesture or face. Yes, it was all simple, and when I was home in my bedchamber I felt much more at ease about it, even enough to write several pages about it in my diary as Amadeo slept like a Fallen Angel on my red taffeta bed. Should I fear this young man who knew where I dwelt? I thought not. I sensed no danger whatsoever. I believed the things that he said. Quite suddenly, a couple of hours before dawn a tragic thought crossed my mind. I must see Raymond Gallant once more! I must speak to him! What a fool I had been. I went out into the night, leaving the sleeping Amadeo behind. And throughout Venice I searched for this English scholar sweeping this and that palazzo with the power of my mind. At last I came upon him in modest lodgings very far from the huge palaces of the Grand Canal. I came down the stairway from the roof, and tapped on his door. \"Open to me, Raymond Gallant,\" I said, \"It\u0027s Marius, and I don\u0027t mean you any harm.\" No answer. But I knew that I had given him a terrible start. \"Raymond Gallant, I can break the door but I have no right to do such a thing. I beg you to answer. Open your door to me.\" Finally he did unfasten the door, and I came inside, finding it to be a little chamber with remarkably damp walls in which he had a mean writing table, and a packing case and a heap of clothes. There stood against the wall a small painting which I had done many months ago and which I had, admittedly, cast aside. The place was overcrowded with candles, however, which meant that he had a rather good look at me. He drew back from me like a frightened boy. \"Raymond Gallant, you must tell me something,\" I said at once, both to satisfy myself and to put him at his ease. \"I will do my best to do this, Marius,\" he answered, his voice tremulous. \"What can you possibly want to know of me?\" \"Oh, surely it\u0027s not so hard to imagine,\" I responded. I looked about- There was no place to sit. So be it. \"You told me you have always known of our kind.\" \"Yes,\" he answered. He was shaking violently. \"I was ... I was preparing to leave Venice,\" he volunteered quickly. \"As you advised.\" \"I see that, and I thank you. But this is my question,\" I spoke very slowly to him as I went on. \"In all of your study, did you ever hear tell of a woman blood drinker, a woman vampire as you call it\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a woman with long rippling brown hair . . . rather tall and beautifully formed, a woman made in the full bloom of life rather than in the budding flower of youth . . . a woman with quick eyes, a woman who walks the night streets alone,\" All this quite impressed him and for a moment he looked away from me, registering the words, and then he looked back. \"Pandora,\" he said. I winced. I couldn\u0027t prevent it. I couldn\u0027t play the dignified man with him. I felt it like a blow to the chest. I was so overcome that I walked a few paces away from him, and turned my back on him so that he could not see the expression on my face. He knew her very name! Finally I turned around. \"What do you know of her?\" I said. I searched his mind as he spoke for the truth of every word. \"In ancient Antioch, carved in stone,\" he said, \"the words, \u0027Pandora and Marius, drinkers of the blood, once dwelt together in happiness in this house.\u0027 \" I could not answer him. But this was only the past, the bitter sad past in which I\u0027d deserted her. And she, full of hurt, must have inscribed the words in the stone. That he and his scholars had found such a remnant left me humbled and respecting of what they were. \"But now,\" I declared, \"do you know of her now? When did you learn of her? YOU must tell me all.\" \"In the North of Europe now,\" he said, \"there are those who say they have seen her.\" His voice was growing stronger, but he was still quite afraid. \"And once a young vampire, a young blood drinker, came to us, one of those who cannot bear the transformation...\" \"Yes, go on,\" I said. \"I know. You say nothing that is offensive to me. Continue, please.\" \"The young one came, hoping we held some magic by which he might reverse the Blood and give him back his mortal life and his immortal soul....\" \"Yes, and he spoke of her? That\u0027s what you mean to say?\" \"Precisely. He knew all about her. He told us her name. He counted her a goddess among vampires. It was not she who made him. Rather coming upon him, she had pity on him, and often listened to his ravings. But he described her as you did. And he told us of the ruins in Antioch where we would find the words she\u0027d written in the stone. \"It was she who spoke to him of Marius. And so the name came to be known to us. Marius, the tall one with the blue eyes, Marius whose mother came from Gaul and whose father was a Roman.\" He stopped, plainly afraid of me. \"Oh, go on, please, I beg you,\" I said. \"This young vampire is gone now, destroyed by his own will without our compliance. He went out into the morning sun.\" \"Where did he come upon her?\" I asked. \"Where did she listen to his ravings? When did this take place?\" \"Within my lifetime,\" he said. \"Though I myself did not see this blood drinker. Please, do not press me too hard. I am trying to tell you all I know. The young vampire said that she was ever on the move, through the northern countries as I told you, but in the disguise of a rich woman, and with an Asian companion, a blood drinker of very great beauty and abrupt cruelty who seemed to oppress her nightly and force her into what she did not want to do.\" \"I can\u0027t bear it!\" I declared. \"Go on, tell me\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;what northern countries? I can\u0027t read from your mind any faster than I can hear your words. Tell me all that the young one said.\" \"I don\u0027t know the countries in which she traveled,\" he answered. My passion was unnerving him. \"This young one, he loved her. He imagined that she would repel the Asian. But she would not. It drove him mad, this failure. And so, feeding upon the populace of a small German town, the young one soon blundered into our arms.\" He paused, to gather his courage and to make his voice steady as he went on. \"Within our Motherhouse he talked incessantly of her, but it was all the same theme\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;her sweetness, her kindness and the cruelty of the Asian from whom she would not break away.\" \"Tell me the names under which they traveled,\" I said. \"There must have been names, names they used as mortals, for how else could they have lived as rich mortals? Give me the names.\" \"I don\u0027t know them,\" he said. He gathered all his reserve now. \"Give me time and perhaps I can obtain them. But I do not in truth think the Order will give me such information to give to you.\" Again I turned away from him. I put my right hand up to shield my eyes. What gestures does a mortal man make at such a moment? I made of my right hand a fist, and held my right arm firmly with my left hand. She lived. Was I not content with that? She lived! The centuries had not destroyed her. Was that not enough? I turned around. I saw him standing there, so very bravely, though his hands trembled at his sides. \"Why are you not terrified of me?\" I whispered, \"terrified that I may come to your Motherhouse and find this information for myself?\" \"Perhaps no such action is necessary,\" he responded quickly. \"Perhaps I can obtain it for you, if you must have it, for it breaks no vows we\u0027ve taken. It was not Pandora herself who sought shelter with us.\" \"Ah, yes, you make a lawyer\u0027s point on this score,\" I answered. \" What more can you tell me? What more did Pandora tell this young one of me?\" \"No more,\" he answered. \"Of Marius, this young one spoke, having heard the name from Pandora\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;.\" I repeated. \"Yes, and then here we discovered you in Venice. I have told you all!\" I drew back once more. He was exhausted with me and so frightened of me that his mentality was almost to the point where it might break. \"I have told you all,\" he said again gravely. \"I know you have,\" I said. \"I see that you are capable of secrecy but quite incapable of a lie.\" He said nothing. I took the gold coin from my pocket, the one which he had given me. I read the word: Talamasca I turned it over. There imprinted on it was the picture of a high and well-fortified castle, and beneath it the name: Lorwich, East Anglia. I looked up. \"Raymond Gallant,\" I said. \"I thank you.\" He nodded. \"Marius,\" he said suddenly, as though screwing up his courage, \"can you not send out some message to her over the miles?\" I shook my head. \"I made her a blood drinker, and her mind has been closed to me from the beginning. So it is with the beautiful child you sawdancing this very night. Maker and offspring cannot read each other\u0027s thoughts.\" He mulled this over as though we were speaking of human things, just that calmly, and then he said: \"But surely you can send the message with your powerful mind to others who may see her and tell her that you search for her, and where you are.\" A strange moment passed between us. How could I confess to him that I could not beg her to come to me? How could I confess to myself that I had to come upon her and take her in my arms and force her to look at me, that some old anger separated me from her? I could not confess these things to myself. I looked at him. He stood watching me, growing ever more calm, but certainly enrapt. \"Leave Venice, please,\" I said, \"as I have asked you to do.\" I untied my purse and I put a good many gold florins on his desk, just as I had done twice with Botticelli. \"Take this from me,\" I said, \"for all your trouble. Leave here, and write to me when you can.\" Again he nodded, his pale eyes very clear and determined, his young face rather willfully calm. \"It will be an ordinary letter,\" I said, \"come to Venice by ordinary means, but it will contain the most marvelous information, for I may find in it intelligence of a creature whom I have not embraced in over a thousand years.\" This shocked him, though why I did not understand. Surely he knew the age of the stones in Antioch. But I saw the shock penetrate him and course through his limbs. \"What have I done?\" I said aloud, though I wasn\u0027t speaking to him. \"I shall leave Venice soon, on account of you and on account of many things. Because I do not change and therefore cannot play the mortal for very long. I will leave soon on account of the young woman you saw dancing tonight with my young apprentice, for I have vowed that she shall not be transformed. But oh, I have played my role most splendidly here. Write it in your histories. Describe my house as you saw it, full of paintings and lamps, full of music and laughter, full of gaiety and warmth.\" His expression changed. He grew sad, agitated, without moving so much as a muscle and the tears came up in his eyes. How wise he seemed for his years. How strangely compassionate. \"What is it, Raymond Gallant?\" I asked. \"How can you weep for me? Explain it to me.\" \"Marius,\" he said. \"I was taught in the Talamasca that you would be beautiful and you would speak with the tongue of an angel and a demon.\" \"Where is the demon, Raymond Gallant?\" \"Ah, you have me. I have not heard the demon. I have struggled to believe in it. But I have not heard it. You are right.\" \"Did you see the demon in my paintings, Raymond Gallant?\" \"No, I did not, Marius.\" \"Tell me what you saw.\" \"Fearful skill and marvelous color,\" he answered, not even hesitating a moment, as though he had thought it through. \"Wondrous figures and great invention, which gave everyone utter delight.\" \"Ah, but am I better than the Florentine Botticelli?\" I asked him. His face darkened. There came a small frown to him. \"Let me answer for you,\" I said, \"I am not.\" He nodded. \"Think on it,\" I said. \"I am an immortal, and Botticelli is a mere man. Yet what are the wonders which Botticelli has done?\" It was too painful for me to be here any longer. I reached out with both hands and gently took hold of his head before he could stop me. His hands rose and they gripped mine but they could do nothing of course to soften my own grip. I came close to him, and I spoke in a whisper. \"Let me give you a gift, Raymond. Now pay attention to me. I will not kill you. I will not harm you. I want only to show you the teeth and the Blood, and if you will allow\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and mark, I ask for your permission\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;I shall give you a drop of the Blood on your tongue,\" I opened my mouth so that the fang teeth were visible to him and I felt his body stiffen. He uttered a desperate prayer in Latin. Then I cut my tongue with my teeth as I had done a hundred times with Amadeo. \"Do you want this blood?\" I asked. He closed his eyes. \"I will not make this decision for you, scholar. Will you take this lesson?\" \"Yes!\" he whispered when in fact his mind said No. I clamped his mouth in an ardent kiss. The blood passed into him, and violently, he convulsed. As I let him go, he could scarcely stand. But he was no coward, this man. And he bowed his head for only an instant and then he looked at me with clouded eyes. He was enchanted for these small moments, and patiently, I let them pass. \"My thanks to you, Raymond,\" I said. I prepared to take my leave through the window. \"Write to me with all you know of Pandora, and if you cannot I will understand.\" \"Don\u0027t ever see an enemy in us, Marius,\" he said quickly. \"Don\u0027t fear it,\" I said. \"I never really forget anything that happens. I will always remember that you spoke to me of her.\" And then I was gone. I came back to my bedroom study, where Amadeo still slept as though wine had drugged him when it had only been mortal blood. For a little while I wrote in my diary. I tried to describe sensibly the conversation which had just taken place. I tried to describe the Talamasca from all that Raymond Gallant had revealed to me. But at last I gave in to writing the name Pandora over and over, foolishly, Pandora, and then I put my head down on my folded arms and dreamt of her, and whispered to her in my dreams. Pandora in the northern countries, what countries, what could this mean? Oh, if I were to find her Asian companion, how I would deal with him, how quickly and brutally would I free her from such oppression. Pandora! How could you let such a thing happen? And no sooner had I asked such a question than I realized I was quarreling with her as I had done so often of old. When it came time to leave the house that night to find our resting place. I discovered Bianca asleep in my studio on a long silken couch. \u0027\u0027Oh, but you\u0027re too lovely,\" I said to her, kissing her hair tenderly and squeezing her beautifully curved arm. \"I adore you,\" she whispered, then went on with her dreaming\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; my fine and wonderful girl. On we went to the golden room in which our coffins awaited us. I helped Amadeo lift the lid of his coffin before I lifted my own. Amadeo was tired. The dancing had wearied him. But he whispered something sleepily to me. \"What is it? \"I said. \"When the time comes, you will do it, you will give Bianca the Blood.\" \"No,\" I said, \"stop speaking of that, you\u0027re infuriating me.\" He laughed his cold uncompassionate little laugh. \"I know you will. You love her too much to see her begin to wither.\" I told him No. And then I went to my rest, never dreaming that it was the last night of our life together, the last night of my supreme power, the last night of Marius de Romanus, citizen of Venice, painter and magician, the last night of my Perfect Time.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-23.html","bookId":2594,"book":{"id":2594,"title":"Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8)","description":"Storyline: Blood And Gold (The Vampire Chronicles #8) Here is the gorgeous and sinister story of Marius, patrician by birth, scholar by choice, one of the oldest vampires of them all, which sweeps from his genesis in ancient Rome, in the time of the Emperor Augustus, to his meeting in the present day with a creature of snow and ice.
