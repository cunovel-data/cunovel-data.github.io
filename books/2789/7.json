Or was it the beginning of compassion? \"Okay.\" \"Okay, what?\" \"Okay, I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ll marry you.\" David accidentally ran the cart into the wall. Silver platters flew everywhere with a clang. \"For crying out loud,\" Christina said, watching scrambled eggs soar through the air, \"maybe I should have broken it to you more gently.\" She\u0027d met him just outside the gallery—in fact, he\u0027d nearly run over her foot with the damned cart. \"I\u0027m just—surprised, that\u0027s all. Happily surprised,\" he added hastily. He moved to her to take her hand, slipped on a piece of bacon, and she ended up steadying him. \"You won\u0027t regret it, Christina,\" he gasped, leaning on her for support. \"You\u0027ve made me a very happy man.\" \"We\u0027ll see, Penguin Boy,\" she said. \"And listen— if it gets too weird—not that that could ever happen—I\u0027m outta here, and the engagement\u0027s off, got it?\" \"Oh, yes. Yes, of course. And, of course, that applies to me, too.\" \"Sure, that\u0027s fine.\" \"Well, no. That was a bluff. I could never break our engagement.\" \"Okay.\" Weird. \"I guess ... should we kiss? Sort of to seal the—mmph!\" The guy was a mind reader! Or he\u0027d slipped again and fallen on her mouth. Either way, they were sealing the deal. And it wasn\u0027t bad at all. He either hadn\u0027t spent enough time in the penguin room to reek, or she\u0027d gotten used to it. All she could smell was bacon, and his own clean scent His mouth was firm on hers, his hand on the back of her neck was wonderfully strong—normally she didn\u0027t care for that, but with David it was like she was protected rather than smothered. \"—my father right away.\" \"Mmmm—huh?\" Nuts. All done kissing. She stared at his mouth. Really, truly all done? Yes, dammit. Worse, he was still talking. \"—said, let\u0027s go tell my father right away.\" \"Oh. Okay. Uh ... but maybe not the rest of the world? Right away?\" \"As you wish.\" He grinned at her, his blue eyes twinkling, grabbed her hand, and they ran through the spilled food. Chapter 9 From The Queen of the Edge of the World, by Edmund Dante HI, © 2089, Harper Zebra and Schuster Publications. As one can imagine (and if one has been paying close attention to this tome), the king was as overjoyed at the news of the crown prince\u0027s engagement as Edmund Dante was appalled. Princess lessons were to begin at once, designers and planners were commissioned, and a date was set for five months hence. .. April the second. Normally that would be a shockingly short time for a royal engagement, but the general consensus seemed to be to \"get it done\" before the bride-to-be could change her mind and flee the country. But first, Edmund Dante was to try one last time to talk the feisty commoner out of her wedding. It is difficult to tell if he did it for his own sake, the country\u0027s, or the future queen\u0027s. And Queen Christina\u0027s reaction to this attempt gives historians another tantalizing glimpse into what drove this foreigner of uncommon strength to take a crown. \"Miss Krabbe ...\" \"Call me Christina. Or Chris. Anything but Tina . . . yech. My mom hates her name her whole life, and what does she do? Slaps it on the end of my name. Nice!\" \"Miss Christina, are you sure you have considered this very carefully?\" \"And by that he means, congratulations,\" the king said, glaring at Edmund from his seat. Edmund forced a smile, which disappeared as quickly as it formed. \"You haven\u0027t been in the country a week, you barely know His Highness, and frankly... ah ... frankly...\" \"I\u0027m not the princess type?\" She tucked her legs beneath her and grinned at him. \"Tell someone who doesn\u0027t know.\" \"Edmund...\" They were in one of the sitting rooms, and the king had called for beer to celebrate the announcement of their engagement. He\u0027d downed two in rapid succession and apparent relief. Christina had taken a sip, masterfully concealed a shudder, and handed her glass to David. \"Your Majesty, please. It must be said. And it appears to have fallen to me.\" \"Who says?\" the king whined. \"You\u0027re gonna queer the deal, and then I\u0027ll be forced to break both your legs.\" \"A lively ending,\" the prince commented, \"to an unparalleled career.\" \"It isn\u0027t fair,\" Edmund said quietly. \"Look to the House of Windsor if you don\u0027t believe me. She must be warned.\" \"Fine, fine, but get it out of the way. And don\u0027t higher, for Christ\u0027s sake.\" \"Too late,\" Christina sang. David, in the act of sitting down beside her, barked surprised laughter and fell to the sofa with a thump. Edmund turned back to Christina. He towered over her like a tree dressed in fine linen. His hands were clasped—clenched—behind his back. \"I—we, rather, wish to be sure you know what you\u0027re getting into. It\u0027s not all palace living and cocktail sauce.\" \"It\u0027s not?\" \"As a member of the royal family, not only will the eyes of the world—\" \"Not to mention People magazine.\" \"—be on you, but you\u0027ll have heavy responsibilities. Also—\" \"Also,\" she interrupted yet again, \"my children will never have to worry about their next meal. They\u0027ll never have to pay taxes, they\u0027ll never have to worry about how to afford to send their kids to college. They\u0027ll always have the option of a solid roof over their heads, and three squares a day. There will always be people around to look after them and protect them. They\u0027ll never, never be alone. And if they see something wrong, they\u0027ll have the power to fix it.\" Dead silence. \"That about right?\" \"Yes.\" David nodded, studying her intently. \"That is exactly right. All that, and more. And all that goes for your children\u0027s children, and your children\u0027s children\u0027s children.\" \"Well. All right, then.\" She smiled, and instantly felt like she’d jettisoned ten pounds of stress. Maybe twenty. \"If there\u0027s nothing else, Edmund, let\u0027s get this show on the road. PART TWO Getting married\u0027s probably not so bad. It\u0027s all the screwing around beforehand that gives you a migraine. —Lady Christina of Allen Hall Chapter 10 \"Ah, Lady Christina, I\u0027m not sure how to ask this...\" \"Well, first off, I\u0027m not a lady,\" she said. \"No kidding,\" David said, grinning. He stopped grinning when one of the royal wedding designers forced a pointed black shoe onto his left foot. \"Uh, can we try one that\u0027s not so—er—Machiavellian? Also, I can\u0027t feel my toes.\" \"I mean,\" Christina said, flipping through one of eighteen sketchbooks, \"it\u0027s not my tide or anything. I\u0027m just plain old Christina.\" \"Not true,\" David grunted, trying to free himself of the shoe. \"Oh, so I\u0027ve had a tide all these years that I never knew about? Hmm, let\u0027s think about this; do you think I inherited it from my truck driver dad or my waitress mom?\" \"With due respect, my lady, the king tells me your title is Lady Christina of Allen Hall.\" She nearly fell out of her chair. \"Since when? And where the hell is that? And do ladies wear blue jeans? Because, if nobody\u0027s noticed, jeans make up about ninety-eight percent of my wardrobe.\" David snickered. \"Allen Hall is the part of the palace where Dad lets me keep the penguins.\" \"Oh, ugh! Very fucking funny. Remind me to kick the king in the slats when I see him next.\" \"Looks better on the invitations if you\u0027ve got a tide, even if it\u0027s minor. I thought you\u0027d be happy.\" \"Then you haven\u0027t been paying attention the last two weeks, boy-o.\" \"You\u0027re right,\" he admitted, shrugging into the black silk coat held by another designer. \"I didn\u0027t really think you\u0027d be happy. But you know Dad... once he\u0027s got his mind made up . . .\" \"Oh, yeah, he\u0027s not like anybody else I know.\" Christina glared at David for good measure, completely overlooking the fact that she could be talking about herself. \"Now, what were you asking me, Harry?\" \"Horrance, my lady. And I was asking—ah—if your dress—your wedding gown, rather—if it— ah—\" \"White,\" she said firmly. \"Right, then,\" Horrance said hurriedly, clapping a sketchbook shut and unwrapping a fresh one. He squinted at Christina and started sketching broad swoops across the paper. \"Reeeeeally?\" David asked with a friendly leer. \"Sure,\" she replied evenly. \"It\u0027s my first wedding, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Ah ... hmm.\" The six people in the room could easily read the MYOB vibes Lady Christina was giving off, so David acted the gentleman and changed the subject. \"What d\u0027you think of this suitcoat?\" \"I think it makes you look embalmed.\" Horrance whimpered. \"Hey, it\u0027s nice and all,\" she added, backpedaling madly, \"but it\u0027s just not him. You know what you should wear? White. It\u0027d really set off your hair.\" Your gorgeous, thick, black-as-sin hair. . . mmm . . . \"The bride wears white,\" Horrance\u0027s assistant— what was his name? Jerry? Jerkin?—said firmly. \"Well, were you in the military? Because you could wear your uniform—\" \"No. I was busy getting my doctorate in marine biology.\" \"Oh, yeah?\" \"Alaska doesn\u0027t require military service from its royals.\" \"Whatever. So, on top of everything else, you\u0027re an egghead. Well, I can overlook that.\" Was it Jeremiah? Julian? \"Fine, don\u0027t wear white. But don\u0027t wear a tuxedo, either. I hate the penguin look. No offense, Dr. Prince David of the Penguins.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-7.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together?
