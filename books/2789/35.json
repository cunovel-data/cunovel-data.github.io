He\u0027ll wake up and then . . . and then he can—can write them.\" Then, shockingly, she burst into tears.\\n\\n \"Jenny!\" Christina took her in her arms and hugged her. \"Don\u0027t cry, Jenny, you\u0027ll get us all started.\"\\n\\n \"There, there,\" Edmund said ineffectually, patting her shoulder with long, skeletal fingers.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she sobbed. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re the queen regnant and I really like David... but I miss the king ... he was really nice to me ... and he\u0027s so sick... and he was so nice ... and he\u0027s in so much trouble because he was nice—a good dad—and—and—\"\\n\\n \"Jeez, will you stop? He\u0027ll be all right. He\u0027s too obnoxious to die.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you take the morning, Jenny, and take some personal time?\" Edmund suggested. \"With Her Majesty\u0027s leave, of course. It\u0027s been a stressful time for all of us.\"\\n\\n \"No, I can\u0027t do that,\" she said, calming. \"I have too much work. We all do.\" Then she stiffened, doubtless freshly realizing the queen was holding her. \"I must beg Your Majesty\u0027s pardon. I—I forgot myself and I\u0027m so—\"\\n\\n \"Jenny. For the love of God. When are you going to lighten up?\"\\n\\n She sniffed and wiped her face with her palms. It hurt Christina\u0027s heart a bit to see that gesture, so childlike. \"Well, again. I apologize.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a stressful time,\" Edmund commented, possibly the understatement of the decade.\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, you can make it up to me by licking envelopes.\"\\n\\n \"Blurgh,\" Jenny said, and the three of them laughed.\\n\\n From the Alaskan Royal Archives.

From the Baranov collection; donated by HRH Prince David HI, prince of Alaska, 2080.\\n\\n This note, on HRM\u0027s personal stationery, is a typical example of Queen Christina\u0027s style of correspondence. It is a thank-you note for an original Picasso, given to the queen on the occasion of her wedding to David, the then-crown prince of Alaska, and donated to the museum by her grandson, Prince David III.\\n\\n May 8, 2005\\n\\n Dear Mr. Gates,\\n\\n Thank you very much for the painting. It\u0027s really amazing. We hung it in Allen Hall, a wing of the castle very important to the king, and where he can see it every day. I try to get in there and look at it when I can. Those are some pretty amazing colors.\\n\\n I\u0027m sorry you couldn\u0027t come to the wedding, but I wish you the best of luck with your lawsuit.\\n\\n Sincerely yours, Christina K. Baranov P.S. I have some of your software, and it works great. Good work.\\n\\n From the private papers of HRM Christina Baranov\\n\\n April 9, 2004\\n\\n My dearest Christina,\\n\\n I just finished watching CNN; you looked beautiful and poised. Well done.\\n\\n I wanted to take a moment to drop you a line to tell you how sorry I am about what happened to King Alexander. Although I\u0027m certain you were personally and professionally horrified by the recent turn of events, I\u0027m equally certain you are up to the task of helping the new king regent run the country.\\n\\n Many times when we talked in my office I could see your fondness for King Alexander and Prince David, and your anxiety that you would be unable to be an asset to his son when the time came.\\n\\n Christina, if no one has mentioned this, then I will do so now: you \u0027re more than capable of the task set before you. No one has a bigger heart or (beneath the swearing) a kinder disposition. I can think of no better woman to be queen, for Alaska and for myself.\\n\\n Please don\u0027t hesitate to call on me at any time if you want to talk; I would dearly love to see you again, although I understand there are now many demands on your time. Now that you are married, you no longer need me, but I miss our talks. I am at your disposal and will come to the palace whenever you require.\\n\\n Until we meet again, I remain,\\n\\n Your friend,\\n\\n Dr. Elinor Pohl\\n\\n Chapter 33\\n\\n \"David?\" She opened the door, grimacing at the smell. \"You in here?\" She walked inside, trying to ignore the penguins, half of which had stopped whatever they were doing to stare at her. Ick. And that weird-ass Picasso, the one that looked like a bar floor after the drunks overindulged. Double ick. What had Bill Gates been dunking? \"Helloooooo? I\u0027m going buggy writing thank-yous and wanted a kiss. And possibly a quickie. Dave?\"\\n\\n Nothing. Well, shit She backed out of the room, never taking her eyes off the weird birds. She shut the door, turned, and nearly fell over the penguin that had somehow snuck around and gotten outside the room.\\n\\n \"Ack!\" She skipped clumsily to avoid stepping on it, lunging a few feet to the side and fetching up painfully against the wall.\\n\\n It stared at her.\\n\\n She opened the door.\\n\\n It stared at her.\\n\\n \"Go back inside, now.\"\\n\\n It clucked. Was it hungry? Thirsty? Preparing to attack?\\n\\n \"Okay, go inside now.\"\\n\\n It totally ignored her.\\n\\n \"Fucking thing,\" she muttered.\\n\\n It clucked louder.\\n\\n \"Sorry.\" She edged a few more feet to the left. It followed her. She edged faster. It followed faster. \"Quit that, now. Quit. Quit! Stop it! Help!\"\\n\\n Chris came rocketing around the corner, nearly knocking David off his feet. She grabbed him like a life preserver and said, \"It\u0027s after me, it\u0027s after me!\"\\n\\n \"What? Who? Is Kurt—\"\\n\\n \"No, fool! It\u0027s coming to eat me or kill me or whatever! It\u0027s like a Terminator with wings—it won\u0027t stop!\"\\n\\n David looked down in time to see a young penguin just past its first molting hurry around the corner. \"For heaven\u0027s sake, Christina, you shouldn\u0027t let them out. They—\"\\n\\n \"Am I not speaking English, King Dumb-ass? It stalked me! It tricked me and snuck out and now I can\u0027t get rid of it. It\u0027s after me!\"\\n\\n He tried very hard not to laugh. It was obvious from her wide eyes and flushed face that she was not remotely amused. \"I\u0027ll take care of it, Chris. Don\u0027t—\" He coughed into his fist and prayed she wouldn\u0027t notice his watering eyes. \"Don\u0027t be frightened.\"\\n\\n She peered at him suspiciously. \"Are you laughing at me, buddy boy?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"You better not be.\"\\n\\n \"I love you,\" he said spontaneously. It was getting a bit easier to tell her each time. She never laughed, at least. Not about that. In fact, she claimed to love him in return.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Still suspicious.\\n\\n \"Oh, several indefinable reasons.\" He kissed her on the nose.\\n\\n \"Yech, get a room.\" They turned to see Kurt smirking at them. He was wearing khakis, loafers without socks, his shoulder holster, and a T-shirt with the logo I\u0027M A GOOD THING. \"Or at least a palace. What\u0027s up, royal dudes?\"\\n\\n \"Christina is making friends,\" David said.\\n\\n \"Very funny. I\u0027m glad to see you, Kurt. Can you take care of it?\" she asked, gesturing down to the penguin, which had edged closer while they talked.\\n\\n \"What do you want me to do?\" he asked doubtfully. \"Shoot it?\"\\n\\n \"For heaven\u0027s sake,\" David said, before Christina could incriminate herself. \"I\u0027ll take care of it. Kurt, make sure she doesn\u0027t get into any more trouble.\"\\n\\n \"Got a hypo of Thorazine?\" he called after David, who laughed in reply.\\n\\n \"Well, well,\" she said, still annoyed. \"Aren\u0027t you two best pals these days.\" Actually, it was kind of nice ... gone was the underlying resentment and me-Tarzan-she-Jane vibe the men would give off whenever they were in the same room.\\n\\n \"Aw, he\u0027s a good guy.\" Kurt lowered his voice. \"I feel sorry for him, you know. What happened to his dad, and then that big-ass promotion. And, of course, being married to you. When it comes to talking to Parliament and visiting orphans, you\u0027re not what I\u0027d call an asset.\"\\n\\n \"Well, we both appreciate you staying around, asshole. David even said so the other day.\"\\n\\n Kurt shrugged. He was more relaxed than she could recall seeing him, and he and Princess Alex were getting quite chummy these days. He appeared to be in no rush to return to LA. She was glad. Alex had confided that he lingered because he still felt guilty about the king getting shot. It was a bad reason to stay, but a good man was staying, so it worked out. Sort of.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"Jenny sent me to get you.\"\\n\\n \"What a slave driver! I just wanted to take a break from interminable thank-you notes.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. She said you left four hours ago.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a big palace,\" she said defensively. \"I was looking for David again.\"\\n\\n \"Excuses, excuses. Come on, I promised Jenny I\u0027d drag you back.\"\\n\\n \"Who exactly is in charge around here? Because it isn\u0027t me.\"\\n\\n \"Ask Edmund,\" he suggested, and walked her to the elevator.\\n\\n Chapter 34\\n\\n \"Really?\" David asked for about the hundredth time. \"It\u0027s not one of your, um, unusual jokes?\"\\n\\n \"For the billionth time—it\u0027s not a joke.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" He grinned.\\n\\n \"Yes, David. Good work. I\u0027m not joking about that, either. I mean, whoof! Good work. Yum.\"\\n\\n He slung an arm around her hips as they walked down the hospital corridor. They had talked briefly to the press outside and, in a tit for tat, the press had stayed outside. Tension was still high, but the country hadn\u0027t imploded or melted since David assumed the crown, so the press and pundits had adopted a wait-and-see attitude.\\n\\n As for today\u0027s goings-on, she and David had been summoned to the king\u0027s hospital room by an urgent call from Princess Kathryn.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s—I can\u0027t believe it. I really can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Then you haven\u0027t been paying attention to the extent of our extracurricular activities, Penguin Boy. Or should I say Penis Boy?\" Then, a nervously, she added, \"Are you—do you mind? I mean, do you like it?\"\\n\\n \"Are you kidding? It\u0027s wonderful news.\" He chorded. \"Edmund\u0027s going to have kittens!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-35.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) \\n In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together? And will the palace still be standing when the dust clears?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:54 PM"}}
