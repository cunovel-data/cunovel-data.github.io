Do you know how many more papers I can get done now? Think of my research!\"\\n\\n \"Toldja he wouldn\u0027t be mad,\" Kurt said, blowing a bubble the size of his head. It smelled strongly of artificial grape.\\n\\n \"How can you chew gum this early? And you, would it kill you to be a jealous of the whole \u0027hey, Princess Christina, over here\u0027 thing?\" she asked, mildly disgruntled. \"And where the hell are we?\"\\n\\n They were in a large, luxuriously appointed room where the east wall was one big window. She could see planes coming in and taking off. In the distance, the plane the royals used to go here and there was slowly approaching. The press corps, locked out on the other side of the wall, was slowly dispersing.\\n\\n \"Hi!\" Prince Nicholas said, dropping his chicken drummie and throwing his arms around her. \"We wanted to see you off!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re getting barbecue sauce all over my shirt. Bleah, how can you be eating at—what time is it, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s ten-thirty,\" the king said with a yawn as he ambled over. He looked more like the grounds-keeper than the country\u0027s reigning monarch in his baggy sweatshirt, drawstring-waist pants with dirt stains at the knees, sockless tennis shoes, unshaven cheeks and jowls, and bloodshot eyes. \"You couldn\u0027t leave at, what? Noon?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, it wasn\u0027t my idea.\" She gave him a hearty smack on the cheek, grinning to see the lip gloss mark she left. \"I bet you\u0027re running on about thirty seconds of sleep. You look like a car wreck, old man.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, it was the first wedding in the family. Party time.\" The king yawned again. \"Marriage looks like it agrees with both of you. David, I haven\u0027t seen you unclench like this since you were out of diapers.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Dad,\" he said dryly.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to have a quick bite, and then you guys are going up, up, and away,\" Princess Alexandria said. Chris was amused to notice she\u0027d changed into jeans and a sweatshirt. She might be comfortable telling David off, but she clearly had no intention of letting the king know she\u0027d been out partying all night. \"Heaven knows there\u0027s plenty of leftovers.\"\\n\\n \"Any chocolate-covered strawberries?\" David asked, wandering over to the buffet table. \"The cute ones that look like brides and grooms? That was a great trick.\"\\n\\n \"Dozens, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Awesome!\" she said, joining him at the table. \"Hi. I\u0027m Christina.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Your Highness, I know. I\u0027m Devon—I\u0027m filling in for Edmund and Jenny until they return. If there\u0027s anything you need, please don\u0027t hesitate to call on me.\"\\n\\n \"Relax, Devon, everything\u0027s fine.\" The guy was tall—not as tall as Edmund but, of course, no one was—and weirdly twitchy, with fuzzy blond brows that looked like tame caterpillars.\\n\\n For someone who hung out at the Sitka Palace, he was a real wreck... most of them were formal, but relaxed. Devon looked like he was going to hurl into the punch bowl any second. Probably the pressure of his last-second promotion. Well, he\u0027d relax when he realized none of them would bite.\\n\\n \"You guys want to check the plane for us?\" the king asked, and the six-man security team obligingly trotted out the door.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll stay here,\" Kurt called after them. \"And guard the salmon.\"\\n\\n \"Check the plane for what?\" Chris asked, al-though she suspected she knew.\\n\\n \"Bombs, guns, porn, bad food—you know,\" Princess Alex said, wolfing down a melon ball wrapped in prosciutto.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027d care enough about us to blow us up?\"\\n\\n \"Nobody I can think of.\"\\n\\n \"So where were you all night, anyway, Alex, hm-mmmm?\"\\n\\n The princess threw a melon ball at her.\\n\\n \"Quit that,\" Christina said, ducking. \"One princess tossing stuff I can handle—don\u0027t you start.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Chris, your shoe is untied,\" Nicky said, and, before she could say anything, he quickly bent to tie it for her.\\n\\n \"You weirdo, anything to touch—\" Zinnnnng-thump!\"—my clothes—huh?\"\\n\\n Zinnnnng-thump?\\n\\n \"Nicky!\" Princess Alexandra screamed. There was a muffled thump as she dropped her buffet plate and it hit the carpet, spilling melon balls like brightly colored pieces of spring.\\n\\n Zinnnnng-thump ?\\n\\n Kurt, in the act of drawing his gun, suddenly crumpled out of sight in exact time with a loud, hollow, Bonnnnnnng!\\n\\n Devon dropped the sterling silver serving tray (miniature wedding cakes had scattered everywhere), stepped over Kurt, corrected his aim, and—\\n\\n \"Nicky, get down!\" the king roared, and his son dropped like a rock and rolled away. There was no mistaking the command in that yell—Christina nearly hit the bricks herself.\\n\\n Zinnnnng-thump, zinnnnng-thump!\\n\\n The king stared at the two small, red, feathered darts sticking out of his chest and slowly folded to the floor.\\n\\n There was another bonnnnnnng! and Devon dropped his gun and clutched his wrist. Kurt was standing beside him, swaying. Blood trickled from his ear and dripped off his jaw. \"Not s\u0027fast without y\u0027r pea shooter, eh?\" he mumbled, then his eyes rolled up to the whites and he fell into the table.\\n\\n \"Y-you have to come with me, Prince Nicholas,\"\\n\\n Devon said, trying a ghastly smile. He had the gall to stretch a hand toward the crouching boy. \"Your place is with us.\"\\n\\n Christina opened her mouth, and found herself shoved backward and to the side. Suddenly it was difficult to see; David had planted himself squarely in front of her.\\n\\n \"Get the hell out of here, you traitorous piece of shit,\" he ordered coldly. \"If you leave now, our security team might not blow your head off.\"\\n\\n \"Us, sir?\" Nicholas asked, slowly straightening. He was very white, and very polite.\\n\\n \"Your mother\u0027s family.\"\\n\\n \"Domonov,\" Christina hissed.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Devon said, barely glancing at them. \"Twice removed. On my mother\u0027s side. The queen is dead, long live the rightful king.\" And he looked at Nicholas—this was somehow more frightening than the shooting—with naked adoration.\\n\\n So fast, Christina thought. She was too shocked by the sudden violence to feel horrified. That would come later. It\u0027s all happening so fast—cripes, he only pulled his gun about thirty seconds ago! This is crazy, it was so easy for him, this is nuts, it\u0027s—\\n\\n \"My father is the true king,\" Nicholas said, too young to know it was useless to reason with a fanatic. \"You\u0027re—you\u0027re wrong. Your plan won\u0027t work. And if it wasn\u0027t my father, if he wasn\u0027t the king, it\u0027d be—\"\\n\\n Chris tried to shove David aside. It was like trying to bully a redwood. \"Devon!\" Chris snapped, her voice cracking like a whip. The man actually jerked around at the sound. \"You\u0027ll never get out of here. You\u0027ve fucked up, it\u0027s done. You\u0027re done. Make yourself useful, and tell us what\u0027s in the darts.\" And God help you, GOD HELP YOU, if the king is dead.\\n\\n \"If Prince Nicholas will accompany me, I will show him to his true—\"\\n\\n Ka-click.\\n\\n Christina, David, and Devon, equally surprised, looked. During their brief chat, Nicholas had crawled under the table, found Kurt\u0027s gun, crawled back, stood, aimed, cocked.\\n\\n \"You shot my daddy,\" he said, and although he looked like a boy who was having a bad day at school, he sounded infuriated. \"You shot my king and my sovereign, and you hurt my friend. So I\u0027m thinking, it\u0027s only fair if I shoot you. Except these aren\u0027t darts. Lieutenant Carlson carries a nine-millimeter Beretta and these bullets leave big holes. I know—he let me practice with it. It\u0027s okay, though.\" He grinned. He grinned like a king on a battlefield, one who sees victory in his grasp. He grinned like Alexander, like Edward I, like Henry VIII, like his forbear, Kaarl Baranov, who got pissed off one day and won himself a country. \"You won\u0027t feel it for long.\"\\n\\n \"Your High—\"\\n\\n Then, the final puzzling sound, a muffled whump-cra-thud! Princess Alexandria had slipped out of her shoes and crept on cat feet behind her distant cousin, picking up a banquet chair on the way. While her brother distracted the traitor who\u0027d shot their father, she swung the chair sidearm, putting every ounce of her one-fifty behind it.\\n\\n Devon did not so much fall down as go flying. It wasn\u0027t like in the movies. In fact, Alex\u0027s arm took the shock of the blow and it would be days before she could raise her wrist above her shoulder. The chair didn\u0027t shatter.\\n\\n Devon\u0027s skull, however, did.\\n\\n Alexandria sprinted to the far door, yanked it open, and screamed, \"Alaaaaaaaaaaarm!\" into the fair spring air. Meanwhile, David had reached his father, had plucked out the darts and was examining them. Christina bent and rested her head on the king\u0027s broad chest.\\n\\n \"These are animal tranqs,\" David said, puzzled. \"I\u0027m not sure exactly what kind, but they should just be enough to knock him out, or—\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not—his heart—help me.\" She positioned herself and, as she had learned as an employee of the Carnival Cruise Line, began a closed-chest massage. One-and-two-and-three-and-four-and— \"Breathe!\"\\n\\n David knelt by his father\u0027s face, eased his mouth open, blew a quick breath.\\n\\n One-and-two-and-three-and—four-and— \"Breathe!\"\\n\\n Another breath.\\n\\n Most of her concentration was on the king, but faintly, on the far edge of her conscious mind, she heard Alexandria say, \"Give me the gun, Nicky, okay?\"\\n\\n One-and-two-and-three-and—four-and— \"Breathe! And somebody check on Kurt—that asshole clocked him pretty good.\"\\n\\n She heard the click as Nicky popped the clip, as he ejected the bullet. Heard him slap the gun into his sister\u0027s hand. Heard Alex saying, \"Oh, Nicky... Nick...\"\\n\\n Suddenly the room was crawling with security types—all the guys who\u0027d been diverted to the plane. And why not? It was their honeymoon. Nobody had tried anything like this in four generations. And Kurt had been armed. And they had been a small group; they had thought they were safe. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-30.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) \\n In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together? And will the palace still be standing when the dust clears?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:54 PM"}}
