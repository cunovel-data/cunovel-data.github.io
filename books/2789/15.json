David would find out soon enough. \"When do you have to go?\"\n \"In another hour. C\u0027mere, I want to show you how to feed them.\"\n \"Can\u0027t we spend this time playing, um, hide-and-seek?\"\n He smiled at her. \"This is important to me, too, Christina. Although, admittedly, not as fine as feeling your—\"\n \"Okay, okay, I get the gist. It doesn\u0027t actually involve touching the dead fish, does it?\" she asked, gingerly crossing the room. Her voice practically echoed off the walls; the penguin palace was a cavern. A zillion of the funny birds were walking and swimming and preening and shitting all over the place.\n \"Says the cook!\"\n \"Hey, if we\u0027re talking a nice fillet or maybe a decent gumbo or chowder, I\u0027ll touch the dead fish, all right? But unless you\u0027ve got some butter and flour in that little cart of yours ...\"\n \"Sorry. Just hoses and buckets.\"\n \"Oooh, sexy.\"\n \"Now, just toss it lightly—it\u0027s a little early for them to start eating out of your hand.\"\n \"Years too early.\" She picked a smelt or whatever the hell it was out of the bucket and tossed it. One of the penguins snatched it out of the air. Yeesh! Carnivore birds who couldn\u0027t fly. But who came up to her knee and could make lunch out of her patella. This got better and better. \"Well, this has been fulfilling and all, and I\u0027ve certainly learned all sorts of new and interesting things about you—\"\n \"Nice try. How about another one?\"\n \"How about not?\" But she grabbed another smelt, and threw it at a penguin about three yards in front of her. \"So, this is what you do all day?\"\n \"Not all day. Some days I have to go see a shrink because my fianc is really stubborn.\"\n \"You\u0027re a real fucking comedian.\"\n \"Are you nervous about Boston?\"\n \"That was a subtle subject change. Actually,\" she said, tossing another fish, \"I just heard about Boston.\"\n \"Jenny?\"\n \"Yeah, she asked me. But you know, David, you could have asked me.\" She was trying hard not to pout.\n \"Well,\" he said looking faintly surprised, \"I put it on my list and delegated it to Jenny. She wouldn\u0027t have asked you without my say-so. So it really was like I\u0027d asked you.\"\n Christina sighed. \"David, David, David ...\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Never mind. To answer your question, I\u0027m looking forward to it. Except for the penguin angle. I seem to be totally unable to get away from penguins in my new life.\"\n David laughed and gave her a quick hug, which she enjoyed entirely too much, given that this was a marriage of convenience. \"Sorry about that. But they\u0027ve been talking about opening the new wing for quite a while, and I didn\u0027t want to put them off any longer.\"\n \"You\u0027re a prince. They\u0027ll wait.\"\n \"Well, yes. But why should they have to?\"\n \"Good answer.\"\n \"Anyway, now that they\u0027ve expanded their exhibit, they\u0027d like me to come down for the dedication ceremony. It\u0027s what Jenny and Edmund refer to as a fluff job ... no real pressure, no tough questions, just smiling for the cameras, cutting ribbons, and looking appropriately modest. Piece of cake, right, Christina?\"\n \"I guess.\" She still had a hard time believing she was news, but supposed her fellow Americans needed to be distracted from their economic woes. More, she loved Boston, and was anxious to get out of the palace for a few days.\n And she kind of liked the idea of traveling with David as a couple. Weird, but there it was.\n \"If you get nervous,\" he was saying, \"just hold my hand really tightly and smile.\"\n She had planned to do that anyway.\n \"Well, well,\" he said the next morning, looking considerably less amused, \"if it isn\u0027t my fianc, the drooling psycho.\"\n \"Uh . .. good morning?\" She looked up from chopping chives for her scrambled eggs. \"Want something?\"\n \"Yes, but I doubt it\u0027s anything you\u0027re going to actually do.\"\n \"Oh, sit down. And calm down.\" She watched as he stalked across the large palace kitchen and slapped the paper down on the chopping block, nearly upsetting her chive pile. It didn\u0027t escape her notice that the kitchen instantly emptied of the few servants who had been there. Apparently the prince in a temper was a rare sight, and nobody wanted to be around for it. \"Hmm, not a bad picture. You can see my teeth. Probably nobody knew I had teeth.\"\n \"The picture is fine. More than fine,\" he added grudgingly. \"It\u0027s the headline we\u0027re all having a lit-de trouble with.\"\n \"Yes,\" she said, taking in ROYAL FIANCEE TREATED FOR RAGING PSYCHOSIS. \"I can see that. By the way, I never used the word \u0027raging.\u0027\"\n \"Really, Chris.\" The corner of his mouth twitched, but he still looked severe. Severely cute! His dark hair tumbled across his forehead and he looked like he\u0027d thrown his clothes on. He hadn\u0027t shaved yet, either. Yum. Someone had clearly hauled him out of bed and tossed him the morning paper. \"What possessed you?\"\n \"The devil?\"\n \"That\u0027s what Jenny thinks. She\u0027s been lying down with a cool cloth on her forehead all morning.\"\n \"Oh,\" Christina said, feeling fresh guilt. She didn\u0027t mean to make Jenny\u0027s job eight times as hard. It just sort of happened naturally. Like acid rain. \"I\u0027ll go see her, if you want.\"\n \"That would be nice. Do you know what else would be nice?\"\n \"No,\" she said humbly, \"but I can guess.\"\n He gave in and laughed. \"Christ! I just about wet my pants when I saw this.\"\n \"What\u0027d your dad say?\"\n \"Never mind,\" he said, getting stern all over again, so she knew the king had thought it was hilarious. Sometimes she thought David was more Edmund\u0027s son than King Alexander\u0027s. \"Look, just try to ignore these impulses toward wickedness, all right? For all our sakes.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027ll try,\" she said doubtfully.\n \"Thank you.\" He snatched her plate—onto which she had just piled her three scrambled eggs with chives and cheddar—and her fork. \"As penance, I\u0027m going to eat your breakfast.\"\n \"That\u0027ll learn me.\" She cracked another three eggs into the bowl. \"Sorry about the rude wake-up call.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me yesterday?\"\n Christina deduced that Jenny hadn\u0027t ratted her out, and made a mental note to do something especially nice for the woman. Maybe even (ech!) go shoe shopping with her. \"There just wasn\u0027t a good way to bring it up.\"\n \"Try harder next time,\" he said sourly.\n \"I will,\" she promised, shutting off the burner, \"for a kiss.\"\n He looked around, seeing the now-deserted kitchen. \"I\u0027ll give you more than a kiss, you little—\"\n Shrieking, she darted away from him. He caught her in one of the dry goods cupboards, which they promptly defiled.\n Chapter 16\n Christina watched the mountains below. No matter how often she was reminded of Alaska\u0027s beauty, it knocked her out every time. It was like living in a postcard. It gave her hope for the rest of the planet... if they could keep this place nice, they could probably—\n \"My lady. . .\" The flight attendant, wearing a navy blue blazer with the royal family\u0027s crest, paused by Christina\u0027s seat.\n She stopped in mid-slurp. It was hard to make a perfect Bloody Mary; most people put too much Tabasco in them. Why not just add too much battery acid? Anyway, this one was perfect. It was also her third.\n She had thought riding in the royal family\u0027s private jet would be cool. Instead, it was weird. The thing was practically empty, except for the crew, Jenny, and the prince. And Jenny was lying down in the rear of the plane, fighting off another migraine with Advil and cold cloths.\n She\u0027d tried to distract herself with the view, but that didn\u0027t last very long. And now here was a flight attendant with news of their doom.\n \"My lady?\"\n \"Eh? We\u0027re crashing? It\u0027s okay. You can tell me. We\u0027re crashing, aren\u0027t we? I promise I won\u0027t get mad. Just tell me.\"\n \"No, my lady. The prince would like to see you in his room.\"\n \"The prince wants to see me?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"But we\u0027re not crashing?\"\n \"Correct.\"\n \"So I can unbuckle?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Okay, then. But I\u0027m taking my drink.\" She unlatched her seat belt, cautiously stood, then walked toward the rear of the plane. She knocked on a small door where the bathrooms would be on a commercial plane, heard David\u0027s \"Come!\" and poked her head in.\n And nearly fell on her ass. \"Wow!\" Instead of a cramped bathroom, it was a medium-sized bedroom, with a desk and laptop in one corner and a queen-sized bed in the other. There was a pitcher of ice water on the bedside table, and a bowl of oranges. Her stateroom on the cruise ship hadn\u0027t been nearly as nice as this.\n David looked up from the computer and smiled, absently brushing his dark hair off his forehead. She really ought to suggest he get a haircut. Later. \"Hello. Thanks for coming back. I wanted to make sure you were handling all this okay.\"\n \"All this? You mean, your super-secret private nookie room?\"\n He laughed. \"I usually use this plane for business, and I can safely say there has been no nookie gotten here.\" His dark blue eyes took on a gleam she hadn\u0027t seen before. \"Although . . . since you\u0027re here ... and we are engaged ...\"\n \"And I\u0027m tipsy on three drinks . .. good bartender, by the way.\"\n \"Why are you drinking? I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen you take a drink. Come here and sit down. What\u0027s wrong?\"\n \"Nothin\u0027.\" She walked four feet forward and sat on the end of the bed. He got up from the desk and sat beside her. She got a whiff of what she was beginning to classify as \"Dave-smell\". . . crisp cotton, light aftershave, and his own clean scent. Yum. \"It\u0027s just. . . this is just kind of weird, you know. And frankly, it just doesn\u0027t seem right not to spend an hour standing in a security line at the airport. Not that I\u0027m complaining. Because I\u0027m absolutely not. But it\u0027s still weird. Jeez, I\u0027ve been saying and thinking weird a lot in the last few minutes. But, there it is.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-15.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) \n In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together? And will the palace still be standing when the dust clears?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:54 PM"}}
