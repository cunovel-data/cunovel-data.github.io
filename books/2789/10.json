One minute he\u0027d been wandering the halls, minding his own business, the next—attacked! \"Oh, sure, it\u0027s just—I\u0027d be crazy to plan on spending—what?—fifty, sixty years with you? Without... you know. Sampling the merchandise.\" \"If I understand you,\" he said carefully, \"and I\u0027m not at all sure I do, you\u0027re proposing we—may I have my shorts back, please?\" \"In a minute,\" she said, and then she was nimbly unbuttoning his shirt and spreading it open. \"This is really too—\" and then he forget where he was going with this as her soft, hot mouth touched his mouth, his throat, his nipples, and now she was actually licking his nipples, and he brought a hand up and fisted it in her hair, and she nipped lightly, which made him yelp, and then he was tugging at her shirt, her shorts, they were writhing together in the dark, his hands were everywhere, relishing the touch of her smooth, warm skin, her curls were in his face and he breathed deeply of her natural perfume. Being with her was like being in a dark garden. He felt her hand clasp him— \"Oh, my. How many vitamins do you eat a day, Dave?\" —and groaned, felt her fingers slide up and down with delicious friction, and had trouble remembering the fact that ninety seconds ago he\u0027d been wandering down the hallway, fully clothed and thinking about Aptenodytespatagonicus. She had straddled him again and was all smooth, nude skin. She was humming something and in a minute he placed it—it was Bad Company\u0027s \"Feel Like Makin\u0027 Love.\" She was still gripping him, and now she was easing herself down on top of him, and he instantly felt his I.Q. drop another thirty points. \"Wait,\" he managed, feeling for her soft pelt. \"It\u0027s too soon, I don\u0027t want to hurt—\" He found her slick folds and realized she was more than ready for him. \"Belay that,\" he added, and she laughed, and eased down on him, and oh, it was—it was exquisite. He put a hand in the middle of her back, feeling her muscles flex, and sliding up into her was like sliding into the best dream he ever had. It was a tight fit, but she didn\u0027t seem to mind, and God knew he didn\u0027t mind. He had thought it was the pinnacle, it was the finest, it simply could not get any better, and then she began to rock against him. He pulled her down, found her soft, sweet mouth, and kissed her while she rocked, rocked, rocked, still humming that excellent tune. He broke the kiss and groaned again, then managed, through gritted teeth, to say, \"I have—very bad—news—\" \"Oh, I know,\" she teased, leaning back and tickling his balls. When she leaned that far back, her curls brushed the tops of his thighs, and he shivered. \"That\u0027s okay. My turn next time.\" \"Deal,\" he gasped, and then came so hard he felt his eyes roll back in his head. \"You tried to kill me,\" he accused, when he had his breath back. \"Oh, sure,\" she said. They were on their sides in the nameless, dark little room; he\u0027d cuddled her against him like two spoons in a drawer. \"That was my fiendish plan all along.\" \"It\u0027s the only explanation I can think of,\" he said, and puffed against the back of her neck, parting the hair so he could kiss the exposed skin. \"I hope you don\u0027t think—that is to say, I enjoyed it very much—very much—but I wouldn\u0027t want you to think—\" \"Relax, Penguin Boy.\" \"Please don\u0027t call me that after coitus,\" he grumbled. \"Please don\u0027t ever call it coitus. And I\u0027m well aware of what happened—didn\u0027t I, what d\u0027you call it—instigate the whole thing?\" \"That\u0027s true,\" he said, cheering up. \"I was just an innocent victim of your lust.\" \"Right. Anyway, I know it was too fast for me. But not for you. Right?\" \"Right. Next time,\" he said, testing her. \"Right,\" she said, yawning into his forearm. \"Next time. Fuck the king.\" \"I\u0027d rather,\" he said, \"fuck you.\" \"Such dirty language from a prince ... I bet that\u0027s the first time you ever said \u0027fuck.\u0027 Um, don\u0027t we have a meeting or something?\" \"Yes, but I have to check on the penguins first.\" \"Ooooh, you\u0027re getting me hot all over again. I love it when you talk about flightless waterfowl after boinking me! Now talk about dead fish.\" \"Christina...\" \"C\u0027mon, I need to hear it!\" \"You\u0027re impossible,\" he grumbled, sitting up and groping for his shirt. \"And you\u0027re stuck with me,\" she said, sounding indecently satisfied. \"Yes,\" he said, feeling more than a little satisfied himself. \"I suppose I am.\" At Lady Christina\u0027s insistence, they combined the meetings with the florist, the caterer, the gown designer, the protocol officer, and about twelve other people into one efficient meeting. Well, as efficient as such a meeting can be ... \"No, no, no. No wedding announcements.\" The royal protocol officer, a woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to Shania Twain, gaped at her. \"But my lady ... we have to ...\" \"Invitations are enough. Look, we all know announcements are just a greedy grab for more presents. And we\u0027re going to get tons of stuff, anyway. Right?\" \"But it\u0027s not a—not a greedy—ah—greedy grab—\" Edmund\u0027s hand dropped to the protocol officer\u0027s shoulder. \"It helps if you close your eyes and think of a happy place,\" he said in her ear. Then, louder, \"Very well, my lady. No announcements ... except to the press.\" \"Well... okay. They\u0027re gonna find out anyway.\" Christina stretched. She felt pleasantly sore. Tackling David had been educational and fun. The man had a dick on him that wouldn\u0027t quit. She couldn\u0027t wait to get her hands on it again. For compatibility\u0027s sake, of course. Not because she craved his company or anything. \"And where is David?\" \"He\u0027s coming, my lady.\" Again, you mean. \"Hip-deep in penguin crap, no doubt.\" \"No doubt, my lady.\" \"And while we\u0027re on the subject—\" \"Of penguin crap?\" \"—who\u0027s paying for this shindig? I\u0027ve got my last paycheck, and that\u0027s it.\" \"I\u0027m paying for it,\" the king announced, entering the large meeting room. \"Sorry I\u0027m late. Last night\u0027s pizza is not agreeing with me.\" Edmund closed his eyes, as if in great pain, and Christina giggled. \"I guess that\u0027s my cue to protest,\" she said, \"but since this is a royal wedding, I guess a royal guy has to pay for it.\" \"You just show up. If you do that, we\u0027ll all be happy.\" \"Really? That\u0027s all I have to do?\" \"Sit down, my lady,\" Edmund said sternly. \"The king exaggerates.\" The king slumped into the tattered blue La-Z-Boy at the head of the table, and hit the recline lever. His feet went up and he sighed. \"So, where were we? And where\u0027s David? Jenny, you don\u0027t look so good.\" \"I\u0027m fine, Your Majesty,\" the protocol officer replied, trying a game smile. \"Put your head between your knees,\" the king ordered. \"It doesn\u0027t help,\" Edmund said. \"Trust me.\" \"Sorry I\u0027m late,\" Prince David said, hurrying in. He looked gorgeously out of breath, and flashed her a secret grin. She had to put a hand over her mouth so as not to grin back. Gorgeously out of breath? Had she really thought that? What was with her lately? \"What\u0027d I miss?\" \"No wedding announcements, just invitations,\" Christina said. \"And your dad\u0027s got the runs.\" \"That makes good sense. The first part, not the latter. Dad, how many times do I have to tell you to lay off the pizza?\" \"You might be the crown prince, but you\u0027re still a punk,\" the king snapped. \"I\u0027ll eat what I like.\" \"Fine, enjoy your week in the bathroom.\" David took the seat next to the bride, bending to drop a careless kiss to her forehead as he did. It was not lost on Edmund that she blushed for a moment and her eyes got very bright. \"Well,\" Jenny began, \"I think we need to pin down the wording of the invitation. I was told that the lady\u0027s parents are deceased?\" Christina nodded. \"Completely deceased.\" \"Well.\" She cleared her throat. \"Protocol dictates that only the living can issue invitations.\" \"Well, duh. I don\u0027t want my dead mom to be inviting people .. . yuck!\" \"Perhaps the king can invite guests on behalf of both parties,\" Edmund suggested. \"It\u0027s a little unorthodox, but...\" \"That will be fine,\" Jenny said gratefully, crossing an item off her list. \"And I\u0027ll meet with the engraver this afternoon, so—\" \"What? Engraver? Come on, that\u0027ll cost a fortune. What\u0027s wrong with just using a printer?\" \"Happy place, you\u0027re in your happy place,\" Edmund reminded Jenny. Christina appealed to the king. \"Seriously, Al, come on—d\u0027you really want to spend a zillion dollars on the invitations? What\u0027s the alternative to engraving?\" \"Raised print,\" Jenny said in the same tone someone would have said, \"A cobra under the bed.\" \"Well, do that. What\u0027s wrong with that?\" \"Chris, hon, I can afford it,\" the king said gently. \"It\u0027s no problem.\" \"I know that, but why throw your money away on something David and I don\u0027t care about? Right, Dave? You don\u0027t care, right?\" \"I don\u0027t care,\" David admitted. \"All right, then. Next!\" The other wedding experts had managed to bunch themselves into the far corner of the meeting room, suspiciously close to the window. As they were meeting on the first floor, escape was plausible. \"Come on, come on,\" Christina said impatiently. \"What\u0027s next?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-10.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together?
