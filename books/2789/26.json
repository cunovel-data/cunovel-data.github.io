You\u0027re not gonna start now.\"\\n\\n \"The \u0027e\u0027 is silent,\" she reminded him, \"but thanks for the vote of confidence.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m serious, kiddo. I know it\u0027s scary, but it\u0027s just an hour or so in front of the cameras, and then it\u0027s strictly fun stuff. You know—until I die,\" he joked.\\n\\n \"Okay. Sorry. I don\u0027t know what came over me.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, you wouldn\u0027t be human if you didn\u0027t get the fidgets once in a while. \u0027Specially today of all days. Shit, I was a wreck on my big day.\"\\n\\n \"You look great, by the way. Like a grown-up and everything.\"\\n\\n \"Fucking shirt collar is choking me. But thanks. You okay, then? You need anything?\"\\n\\n She managed a smile. \"I\u0027m fine. Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. See you out there. And Chris—really— David\u0027s a lucky boy. You look like a million bucks. In fact, you look like a queen.\"\\n\\n She blanched. \"Don\u0027t say that.\"\\n\\n \"Right. Sorry. But you do. Okay, sorry. \u0027Bye.\"\\n\\n Mercifully, he left.\\n\\n Jenny hurried back in, carrying her bouquet of light blue irises, and lugging Christina\u0027s bouquet of white and red roses, and dark purple irises. \"I just got the word, Your Highness. We\u0027re on in three minutes.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t start with that \u0027Your Highness\u0027 stuff,\" she warned, accepting the bouquet, which weighed approximately six tons.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m well aware of your dislike of tides,\" Jenny said, smiling shyly. \"I just wanted to be the first one to call you that.\"\\n\\n \"Jenn—get a life. I\u0027m serious.\"\\n\\n She laughed, which made Chris laugh. Unlike the demure young lady she presented to the world, Jenny had a whooping, infectious laugh. And for a moment, it was almost like an ordinary day.\\n\\n \"Ready, my lady?\" Edmund whispered.\\n\\n She was frozen, a deer in the headlights. She\u0027d never seen so many people in one room—one enormous, cavernous room—in her life. And she hadn\u0027t even entered the room. She was still in the foyer, peeking in.\\n\\n She knew she was supposed to start walking down the aisle. Everyone was waiting. More important, David was waiting.\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t do it. She wouldn\u0027t do it. She\u0027d run away. Leave now, today. Hike up into the wilderness ... in Alaska, there was plenty of it. She knew how to hunt, she knew how to fish. She wouldn\u0027t be a princess; she would be a hermit. A smelly blond hermit who had narrowly escaped becoming royalty.\\n\\n \"My lady?\" Edmund was looking at her with no small amount of concern.\\n\\n \"Ready,\" she whispered, with a smile that felt ghastly on her face. Stupid, pointless fantasy. Of course she would go through with it. She had promised, hadn\u0027t she? Not in so many words, but the ring she had accepted and wore on her finger was a promise—a promise set in platinum, with blue diamonds.\\n\\n So—she would get married. And as for the rest of it, for her future job as queen or co-boss of Alaska, like Scarlett, she\u0027d worry about that tomorrow.\\n\\n The strains of Clarke\u0027s Trumpet Voluntary filled the air with their rich sweetness, and she started down the aisle. Suddenly there were too many things to look at; her brain struggled to process them all. And her smile felt frozen on her face.\\n\\n First: the faces. Hundreds of them, all turned toward her. She thanked God she was wearing neither (a) pumps, nor (b) a train.\\n\\n Then: cameras. All kinds of them. She spotted NBC, CBS, BBC, MSNBC, PBS, and ANB (Alaskan National Broadcasting), and that was just in one glance.\\n\\n There were funny little flags hanging on the end of each pew ... navy blue, with a big white letter. Some of them had a C, and some had a D.\\n\\n Oh, right... David and Christina. Huh.\\n\\n And flowers, flowers everywhere. Masses of roses, piles of irises. The church smelled like a garden. Or a funeral.\\n\\n She walked, she walked, she would never get to the end of this aisle. She walked alone—that had been tricky. Al had offered to give her away and she\u0027d used all of her tact (what there was of it) to turn him down nicely; she would not walk to her husband clinging like a vine to someone else. No matter how tempting it was. So—she walked alone.\\n\\n Faces, faces, still more faces—how many people had they crammed in here? She\u0027d thought the church on the palace grounds was enormous; it seemed far too cramped and crowded now. Faces.. . faces ... hat. Hat. Purple hat. Purple hat! Jenny\u0027s mom was wearing a purple hat; Chris looked at her, observed that the older woman had Jenny\u0027s great dark eyes, and tipped her a wink. The purple hat bobbed in startled response.\\n\\n She saw Kathryn, she saw Alex, she saw Jenny. She saw Prince Alexander, skinny as a blade in his tux—the boy really should lift weights or something, fill out—she saw the king, she saw Nicky, she saw... yes! There he was, at last: David, her groom. Hers. Very soon. Finally.\\n\\n He looked unbelievable. He looked beautiful and kingly and wise and gorgeous and broad-shouldered and clean-shaven and kind and charming, all at once. He towered over nearly everyone, everyone but the king. His hands were clasped behind his back; he looked downright mouthwatering in his tuxedo. Who\u0027da thunk it?\\n\\n He was smiling at her.\\n\\n She reached his side. He bent forward and said, for her ear alone, \"You look incredible.\"\\n\\n She whispered back, \"What time does your tux have to be back?\"\\n\\n People magazine\u0027s photographer caught them giggling at the altar; it was the lead in every entertainment magazine in the world.\\n\\n Chapter 25\\n\\n She was wholly unprepared for the roar that greeted her and David as they entered the SitkaPalace\u0027s main ballroom: \"Long live the prince and princess!\"\\n\\n \"Well, thanks,\" she said. Under her breath, to David: \"I assume they\u0027re talking about us?\"\\n\\n \"Afraid so,\" David said, squeezing her hand. \"Ready to run the gauntlet?\"\\n\\n \"It can\u0027t be worse than getting married and crowned. No offense,\" she added.\\n\\n \"Of course not—who could find that offensive?\" He rolled his eyes at her and brought her to the receiving line.\\n\\n Where she shook hands for what seemed to be eight and a half hours. \"Hello ... thanks for coming... thank you very much . . . yes, thanks ... hi ... hello... thanks for coming... thanks, Horrance designed it for me ... no, I wanted something besides white ... never you mind ...\"\\n\\n Jenny was on her left; David was on her right.\\n\\n Jenny was doing both of her jobs—bridesmaid and protocol officer—at once. She would occasionally whisper the person\u0027s name to Christina, who would obediently repeat it.\\n\\n \"Queen Rania, Jordan,\" she muttered, and Christina found herself eye to eye with a woman pretty enough (and thin enough) to be a Victoria\u0027s Secret model.\\n\\n \"Hi, Queen Rania... thanks ... thanks for coming ... thanks, I wanted to try something besides white ...\"\\n\\n \"Princess Elizabeth, Yugoslavia.\"\\n\\n \"Hi, Princess Elizabeth . . . that\u0027s so nice of you to say . . . yes . . . thanks for coming . . . hi.. . hello there ...\"\\n\\n \"Crown Prince Frederick, Denmark.\"\\n\\n \"Hi... thanks ... yes, I am glad it\u0027s over... yeah ... well, it\u0027s only for one day, right?\"\\n\\n \"Crown Princess Mathilde, Belgium.\"\\n\\n \"Great dress ... thank you ... we appreciate you coming all this way...\"\\n\\n \"King Juan Carlos, Spain.\"\\n\\n \"Hullo, King Juan ... thanks ... yes, I picked them out myself. .. thank you ...\"\\n\\n \"Charles, the Prince of Wales—\"\\n\\n \"Him I know, Jenn.\" Still waiting patiently to wake up from this bizarre dream, Christina was amazed to find herself shaking hands with Prince Charles. In person he seemed nice enough—he had the big ears caricaturists so loved to exaggerate, but his eyes were warm and kind, and he told her David was a lucky man.\\n\\n \"Well, thank you, Prince Charles.\" Jenny had told her it was entirely proper to refer to visiting royals by their titles and name. She knew Christina, as an American of no particular family, wasn\u0027t interested in referring to anyone else as \"Your Highness.\" However, once she was married, like it or not, she would have rank equivalent to many of the royal guests. \"I\u0027m lucky, too. We appreciate you coming all this way.\"\\n\\n \"My mother regrets she was unable to be here,\" he offered smoothly.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m sure she\u0027s busy. Y\u0027know, keeping an eye on England and all.\"\\n\\n Prince Charles laughed. \"That she is, Your Highness.\"\\n\\n \"Christina, please.\"\\n\\n \"Christina, then.\" He pressed her hand. He really was charming, in an urbane, geeky kind of way. His breath was minty fresh. \"Congratulations again.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Prince Charles.\"\\n\\n \"Suzanne Somers,\" Jenny whispered.\\n\\n \"I know her, too,\" Chris said, exasperated. \"Hi! I\u0027ve got a Thighmaster and I just love it.\"\\n\\n Ms. Somers made a gracious reply, looking like a million bucks in a bronze-colored dress that set off her hair and eyes superbly. Christina was amazed... she\u0027d had no idea Suzanne\u0027s eyes were so big and blue and pretty.\\n\\n \"It was so nice of you to invite me,\" Ms. Somers was saying.\\n\\n \"Well, like I said. Love that Thighmaster. I hate my Buttmaster, though ... that thing kills! I can barely walk the next day—I\u0027m sincere!\"\\n\\n The famous blonde laughed. \"Then you\u0027re doing it right, Princess Christina!\"\\n\\n \"Great,\" she mock-grumbled. Then, \"Hi, Dr. Pohl!\"\\n\\n \"Your Highness,\" her shrink said demurely, then giggled. \"Sorry, I couldn\u0027t resist. You look breathtaking.\" The doc kissed her on the cheek. \"Nice work.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks. And thanks for coming.\"\\n\\n \"Frankly, I was amazed to receive an invitation.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you shouldn\u0027t have been,\" Christina said seriously. \"I really wanted you to come. I—I\u0027ve enjoyed our talks.\"\\n\\n Dr. Pohl laughed at her.\\n\\n \"Well, okay, they gave me something to think about, anyway. Listen, I\u0027ll catch you at the reception, okay?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-26.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) \\n In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together? And will the palace still be standing when the dust clears?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:54 PM"}}
