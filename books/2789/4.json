{"id":89242,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The first course, fresh oysters on the half shell, was brought out. David sucked the first one down while keeping half an eye on the woman beside him. She was really something—adorably cute, with bouncy blond hair and freckles sprayed across her nose and cheeks. Beautiful green eyes, the color of forest moss. She smelled terrific, like soap and wildflowers. And the mouth on her! If she was intimidated to find herself lunching with the royal family, she sure didn\u0027t show it. Most people sat stiff as a board and barely touched their meal. \"So, there\u0027s not a lot of bowing and scraping around here, I noticed,\" Christina said, eyeing the oysters with a neutral expression. \"Bowing and scraping Is discouraged by Papa. Plus it takes too long.\" \"What was that?\" Christina, completely befuddled, asked Prince Alexander. Prince David leaned close and murmured, \"My brother\u0027s in this phase right now. He only speaks in haiku.\" \"Why?\" \"He lost a bet,\" Princess Alex said. \"Anyway, back to the bowing and scraping. Our father discourages it.\" She drained her water glass and, the second she set it down, a footman glided over and filled it again. \"We weren\u0027t really raised to bow when the sovereign enters, bow when called, bow when he leaves, bow—\" \"Big damned waste of time,\" the king said with his mouth full. \"And this is Alaska. We usually have more pressing matters on our mind than royal protocol.\" \"Unlike some royal families,\" David said, looking down his long nose. \"Don\u0027t blame the Windsors Locked into their traditions They are prisoners, too.\" \"That is amazing,\" Christina announced. \"You can just—come up with those on the fly? You open your mouth, and poetry pops out? I couldn\u0027t write a poem to save my life.\" Prince Alex smiled at her. Women were not usually impressed with his haiku. Or his fanatic interest in the period films of George Lucas. \"Kid\u0027s right—don\u0027t be slamming the Windsors,\" the king said, salting his lox. David thought it was a miracle his father didn\u0027t have a cholesterol level of eight hundred. \"They can\u0027t help it. They\u0027ve been doing the same shit for fifteen hundred years. Like Alex said, they\u0027re prisoners as much as any poor slob in jail.\" \"That\u0027s nice. Umm... where\u0027s the cocktail sauce?\" Christina whispered to Edmund, who had taken up his post by the window, four feet behind her. Edmund leaned forward. \"I beg your pardon, ma\u0027am?\" \"The cocktail sauce,\" she said loudly and slowly, as if speaking to someone developmentally delayed. \"For. The oysters.\" \"It comes with a vinaigrette,\" David explained. \"Try it, I think—\" \"I think I\u0027ll barf if I have to suck down raw oysters without cocktail sauce. You know those annoying people who have to put ketchup on everything?\" \"Like the king?\" Edmund asked snarkily. She ignored that. And David found he had to bring his fist up and rest it below his nose to hide the grin. \"Well, I\u0027m one of those people who have to put cocktail sauce on seafood.\" \"Jeez, what\u0027s wrong now? \" the king complained. \"Well, hell, my rights are being stomped on!\" said Christina. \"Your rights as an illegal alien?\" Princess Alexandria asked, and she did not trouble herself to hide her grin. \"Alexandria, we\u0027re trying to be nice to her,\" the king sighed. \"Matchmaker!\" she coughed into her napkin by way of reply. \"Matchmaker?\" Nicholas repeated, delighted. He barked shrill, boyish laughter. \"For crying out loud,\" David muttered. Completely unfazed by the current discussion, their guest continued. \"I mean, Jesus, you guys are lucky I\u0027m even willing to eat these things.\" Prince David jerked his head back, narrowly avoiding Christina\u0027s waving hands. \"The first guy who ever ate a raw oyster was a fearless—or desperate—son of a bitch, I can tell you that right now. Let\u0027s call a spade a spade, here—it looks disgusting. I\u0027m sorry, but there it is—ow!\" A roll sailed across the table from Princess Kathryn\u0027s side, beaned Christina in the forehead, then fell into her plate with a plop. Oyster shells rattled and Christina looked up, but the princess in question was wolfing down her oysters and didn\u0027t return the gaze. Christina stared at her suspiciously for a long moment, then added, \"So, cocktail sauce?\" Prince Nicholas had disappeared under the table, the better to muffle his laughter, which was piercing, to say the least. The king was resting his head on his hands, and Edmund was stonily silent. Martha, the senior server, had reappeared and was holding a silver tureen brimming with, David prayed, cocktail sauce. She set it before Christina, smiled, and moved away with her usual silent, speedy efficiency. \"There! Cocktail sauce. Well, thank you.\" She twisted around in her seat to glare at Edmund. \"Was that so damned hard, Jeeves?\" \"Edmund.\" \"Whatever.\" David joined his little brother beneath the table. After lunch, Christina wandered around the castle, guidebook (The Official Sitka Palace Guidebook, revised edition 2003) in hand. Lunch might have been weird, with a yelling king and giggling princesses and a weirdly silent crown prince who later ducked under the table with his little brother, but the palace was pretty swell; the CinderellaCastle at Disney World had been modeled after it. Eventually, after many turns and stairwells, she found herself in a long room lined with portraits. The floor-to-ceiling curtains were drawn, to protect the paintings, she figured, but the room was filled with soft lighting. Here was the king as a little, sneery boy. That pony didn\u0027t look too happy, either. Here was the king\u0027s mother, a kind-looking, white-haired woman—look at all those curls!— with the king\u0027s laughing blue eyes. Here was the king\u0027s great-grandfather, Kaarl Baranov, who helped break Alaska away from Russia, and won a crown for his trouble. Here was his great-grandmother, the legendary Queen Kathryn, who was a chambermaid in the king\u0027s house when she caught his eye. Funny to think of a regular woman helping run the country. Well, they did it in America all the time. Here was . . . whoa. Here was a woman, imposing and beautiful and frightening, all at the same time. Her waist-length hair was deepest black, and her eyes, green as poison, glittered from the portrait. Her dress was made of deep blue velvet and she wore a necklace of sapphires as big as Christina\u0027s thumbs. Her skin was creamy white, unblemished and perfect. Her nose was a blade—Princess Alexandria\u0027s nose. Her mouth was blood red. Her teeth were very white, and looked sharp. The mouth of a passionate lover ... or a woman who would bite when she was angry. \"She was something, eh?\" Christina jumped, then replied, \"She sort of reminds me of the wicked queen in Snow White. You know. . . she was beautiful, but it didn\u0027t stop her from being bad.\" \"Hmmm.\" She turned—and jumped again when she recognized David. \"Oh, shit! I just insulted one of your relatives, didn\u0027t I?\" \"My mother,\" he said. She clapped her hands over her eyes. \"Aaarrgghh! I thought she looked familiar! Jeez, I\u0027m really sorry. It\u0027s been so long since she—um—jeez, this isn\u0027t going to get any better. ...\" \"Well.\" She felt him gently grasp her wrists, and pull her hands away from her face. \"You\u0027re right, you know. She was beautiful. But she had her terrible side, too.\" Christina couldn\u0027t think of a single thing to say to that, so she just stared at the prince. He was pretty easy to stare at, truth be told ... he looked a lot like his father, had the same thick black hair and piercing blue eyes, the same build, almost the same height. She felt small next to him. And his mother! Queen Dara had flaunted her affairs to the press and the king, respectively. Rumors of divorce had been thick, but then fate intervened. The queen had been killed in a car crash, during a rendezvous with her lover du jour. She\u0027d apparently been applying lip-liner and had accidentally driven off a cliff. It was horrible and funny at the same time. A field day for the press. David, if she recalled her modern history, had been seventeen at the time. Nicholas, the youngest, had just been born. And there had been nasty rumors about that, hadn\u0027t there? About Nicholas maybe being only half royal... \"Your family,\" she said, because she had to say something, \"is really—uh—special. You got a gorgeous sister, a teenage sister who\u0027s gonna be gorgeous but who in the meantime doesn\u0027t talk much, a cute younger brother who only talks in poems— and the boy really needs a milkshake. What\u0027s he weigh, a hundred pounds? And he\u0027s six feet tall? And another brother who hangs out under the dining room table to yuk things up. And they all look the same except Nicholas, who has a head full of curls I would die for! Never a dull moment, huh?\" \"I\u0027ve come to ask you something,\" David said abruptly. \"Right. I\u0027ll go pack.\" He smiled at her. His teeth were even and very white. He\u0027d inherited his mother\u0027s mouth, if not her less desirable qualities. Christina would kill for the name of his orthodontist. He had a dimple in his left cheek. He was really very yummy, if a little standoffish, but that was— \"—like it here?\" \"Huh? I mean, yeah, it\u0027s great. Your dad was really nice to let me come over and stay.\" \"He\u0027s a sucker for hard-luck cases.\" \"Is that what I am?\" she asked, amused. \"But I\u0027m getting off track. Christina ... I was wondering .. . would you consider becoming my wife?\" She laughed. \"I thought you just asked me to marry you. The acoustics in here!\" \"I did.\" \"I—what? Oh.\" She considered for a long moment. \"You mean it? You\u0027re not teasing?\" \"No.\" He took her hand, rubbed the knuckles gently with his thumb. \"I\u0027m not teasing.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-4.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together?
