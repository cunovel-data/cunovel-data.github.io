{"id":89274,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"\"Thanks for a truly disturbing visual—oh, here we are.\" They walked into the private room, where Dr. Sarett and Princess Alex were waiting for them. \"Where\u0027s everybody else?\" \"Nicky\u0027s got riding lessons—I didn\u0027t want to interrupt. I know Dave wants the kid\u0027s life to stay as normal as possible under the circumstances—the other Alex is touring a new battered-men\u0027s shelter, and Kathryn is meeting with the COCS.\" Christina giggled. The Coalition of Cruise Services had the worst acronym ever. She knew it was immature, but hearing it out loud always slayed her. David went to his father, straightened blanket, and kissed man\u0027s forehead. He didn\u0027t look deadily ill—in fact, David was paler. King Alexander merely looked like he\u0027d fallen asleep after a hard day. Possibly one where heavy drinking was involved. \"Is there news, Doctor? My sister said it was urgent.\" \"Well. I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s what you\u0027d call urgent .. .\"Weeks of frequent meetings and medical updates with the royal family had helped him loosen up a bit. He still dressed too stiffly for a doctor; Christina imagined hospital administration insisted he wear a dark suit under his lab coat, and his mahogany-colored shaved head gleamed under fluorescent lights. He\u0027d be downright scrumptious, she thought, if he\u0027d lose the big, clunky glasses and switch to contacts. His brown eyes swam behind the large lenses, making him look constantly near tears. \"It\u0027s definitely promising, howev—\" \"He\u0027s starting to wake up!\" Princess Alex interrupted. \"He talked!\" \"No way,\" Christina said, utterly flabbergasted. \"Way, my queen. He said \u0027ham and... \u0027 That was it. Like ham and eggs.\" \"Dr. Sarett, how many times do I have to tell you? It was salmon. My dad\u0027s a fisherman. Trust me, wherever he is in his head, he\u0027s thinking about fish, not eggs.\" \"What happens next?\" David said. \"Well, we\u0027ll keep monitoring him closely, of course, but his brain waves are already shifting and he does appear to be—\" \"English, remember,\" Alex warned. \"It\u0027s like he\u0027s in the deep end of the pool, and he\u0027s swimming toward the shallow end.\" \"That\u0027s awesome!\" \"Yes, Your Majesty. Her Highness thought you and the king should know right away.\" \"Her Highness knows her shit.\" \"Awwwww,\" the princess said mockingly. \"That\u0027s so nice.\" \"So, can we hang around and wait for him to wake up?\" Chris asked eagerly. \"Your Majesties are welcome to wait, but it could take him another month to come all the way back. However, studies have shown that comatose patients can hear and even see—you\u0027ve noticed his eyes open occasionally—so if you\u0027d like to speak to him, it might facilitate—\" Christina bent until her mouth was level with the king\u0027s ear. \"Hey, dickhead! Your kid knocked me up! So rise and shine, because I\u0027m not doing this by myself! Now get up before I put my foot up your lazy ass!\" She straightened and cleared her throat. \"How\u0027s that?\" Dr. Sarett\u0027s eyes were bigger than usual behind his glasses. \"That will probably do the trick, Your Majesty.\" He clutched the king\u0027s chart protectively to his chest. Chris and Alex grinned at each other, each imagining the notes the guy was going to add later. David merely looked pained. \"Congratulations, by the way,\" the doctor added. \"Yeah, that\u0027s so great, you guys!\" Alex hugged Christina, then grabbed her brother and squeezed him so hard he gasped. \"When did you find out?\" \"About ten minutes ago,\" David said. \"This morning,\" Christina said. \"The stick was blue. But chill out, we\u0027re not telling the planet for at least another couple weeks.\" \"Boy,\" the princess said, impressed, \"you guys didn\u0027t waste any time. Honestly, David, I thought you were a monk or something.\" \"Ha!\" Christina chortled. \"I\u0027m not having this discussion,\" David said. \"Thank Christ,\" King Alexander II said. Chapter 35 She opened the door of Allen Hall and spotted \"her\" penguin at once; it was getting disgustingly fat. She really had to stop sneaking up here and feeding it. Just because David told her it was an orphan didn\u0027t mean she, like, had to bond with it or anything. \"Hey, guess what, Fred?\" she asked as it came toward her as fast as its nonexistent legs could carry it. \"Al woke up! Isn\u0027t that the coolest? Now .. .\" She crossed the room, opened the feeding closet, rummaged, then grabbed a bucket of fish out of the fridge. \"Okay,\" she said, turning back, \"I can\u0027t give you the whole bucket this time, because that book of David\u0027s I read said too much wasn\u0027t—\" The door to Allen Hall opened, and in came Edmund. Carrying a bucket. He saw her and started in surprise. Best defense: good offense. \"What are you doing here?\" she snapped. \"Surely Your Majesty has greater demands on her time,\" was his frosty reply. Fred had totally forgotten about her and was now hopping up and down in front of Edmund. The two-timing little creep! Fred. Not Edmund. \"Perhaps I should bring this up with the king.\" \"Which one? Never mind. Look, let\u0027s just put all our cards on the table, all right? I won\u0027t tell if you won\u0027t, okay?\" \"... as you wish.\" \"Yeah. Consider that, like, a royal command. Or something.\" Edmund reached into the bucket, withdrew a smelt in his long, white fingers, and dropped it. Fred made it vanish. \"Or something, yes, ma\u0027am.\" She narrowed her eyes at him, but all he did was look innocent (as much as he could, anyway) and keep feeding Fred. \"All right, then,\" she said at last. \"Her Majesty is quite right,\" Edmund said suddenly. \"They are inordinately smelly birds.\" \"And annoying.\" \"Can\u0027t even fly.\" \"Can\u0027t keep them full!\" \"All in all, quite aggravating.\" \"Okay, so we\u0027re agreed.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"Okay. Well, \u0027bye.\" \"It\u0027s merely that I felt the king regent had enough demands on his—\" \"Eds—don\u0027t even bother.\" He sighed and dropped another smelt. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"Now don\u0027t get me wrong, Al—\" \"Oh, man, here we go.\" The king was sitting up in his hospital bed, wolfing down green Jell-O. His hospital gown kept slipping, revealing formerly tanned skin that had paled during his hospital stay. \"All aboard for the ingrate train.\" \"—because I\u0027m glad you\u0027re awake and all—\" \"I\u0027ll bet, Queen Regnant Christina.\" \"—but cripes! Talk about a heart attack! I nearly fell out the window.\" \"You were nowhere near the window. This Jell-O sucks. Somebody get me a steak. Two steaks.\" \"No steaks for you, Coma Boy. Not for a while, at least.\" \"No steak, my ass! Who\u0027s in charge around here?\" \"Neither one of us, I\u0027ll tell you that much.\" \"Congratulations. Once you realize that, you\u0027re ready to be queen.\" \"No, thanks. Did you see David? He aged about twenty years in six minutes.\" \"Cry me a river. Kid\u0027s gonna have to suck it up again sometime ... longer than a few weeks, too. God, this Jell-O is terrible.\" \"Stop your whining.\" Christina raised shades and squinted out at the sunny day. \"So when can you start running Alaska again?\" \"I dunno. Doc says I\u0027m here for at least another week. And I could use a vacation.\" Christina nearly fell out the window again. \"Vacation! You\u0027ve been asleep for almost two months!\" Edmund rapped discreetly and crept into the room. Al and Christina stared; Edmund never crept There were rumors that he snuck, but he\u0027d never been caught. \"Good afternoon, Your Majesty. Your Majesty.\" \"Oh, come on,\" she groaned. \"I feel your pain, my queen. But technically you\u0027re still co-regent until Parliament relieves you.\" \"And they can\u0027t un-king me,\" Al said with a remarkable lack of smugness. \"The queen of England is here to see you, Sire.\" \"Uh-huh. Pull the other one. And get me a steak. And find out when I can go fishing again. And where\u0027s the mail? I can at least go through my mail while I\u0027m trapped in this cotton hellhole.\" \"No mail!\" Chris said loudly. \"You\u0027re supposed to take it easy. Believe me, believe me, no one wants you up and around more than I do. But you gotta do it slowly. By the way, stay away from animal tranquilizers in the future.\" \"Yeah,\" the king said dryly. \"I hear they make me sick.\" \"King Alexander, Queen Christina,\" Edmund said loudly, startling them both... he usually slipped away during an argument, disappearing like Batman. \"Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth of Great Britain.\" Queen Elizabeth walked in. For a record third time in two hours, Christina nearly fell out the window. Even the king looked stunned; a scrap of green Jell-O clung to his beard and his mouth was open. He hastily adjusted his hospital gown. \"Good afternoon,\" the queen said. \"Buh,\" Christina said. \"Hi, Liz. Thanks for coming by.\" Queen Elizabeth\u0027s regal brow wrinkled momentarily, n smoothed out. \"It is my pleasure, Alex. I am so pleased to see you\u0027ve begun your recovery.\" She was a small woman, surprisingly small, but she stood ramrod-straight in her blue tweed suit. Her hat was also blue, with a tiny veil she could peek through. Her gloves were white, and immaculate. Her shoes were low-heeled, dark, and sensible. Her dark gray hair looked perfect; nothing was out of place. A white purse with a white strap dangled from her forearm. Her eyes, the color of faded denim, missed nothing.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-36.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together? And will the palace still be standing when the dust clears?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:54 PM"}}
