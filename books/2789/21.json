There you are. I\u0027ve been looking all over the place for you. Literally, all over the place. What\u0027s this about living at the palace after we get married?\" \"What\u0027s this about honeymooning in New York?\" \"Well, I was gonna run it by you,\" she muttered. \"Ditto.\" He fell into step beside her. Today, interestingly, he was wearing a black suit, which set off his dark hair superbly. He was freshly shaved and she caught the clean, sharp smell of his aftershave lotion. \"So, um, how\u0027d it go at the cemetery?\" \"As well as could be expected. I\u0027m sorry, I thought you had our schedule for the day.\" \"I don\u0027t read them,\" she admitted. \"Ah.\" \"Hey, listen, Dave, I love the ring.\" His brow furrowed. \"Which one?\" \"This one,\" she said, showing him her hand. \"It\u0027s the greatest. And the latest! Thanks a million. I hope it didn\u0027t—you know—it wasn\u0027t too much trouble to find.\" \"No.\" He smiled, took her hand, looked at it for a moment, squeezed it, let go. \"It wasn\u0027t. I\u0027m glad you like it. You\u0027re keeping this one, then?\" \"You bet I am!\" \"Wonderful. Did you show it to Kurt?\" \"Not yet—I just got back and saw it. Well.. .just got back three hours ago, I mean. I\u0027ve been looking everywhere for you.\" He was finally loosening up a bit; she was relieved to see it. \"I\u0027m sorry you thought I was lost in the dungeons.\" \"Uh . . . you don\u0027t really have dungeons, do y—\" \"Edmund is taking you to our apartments?\" \"Yeah. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll be fine, but listen, we don\u0027t have to live here, like, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, do we?\" \"No, of course not.\" \"Okay. Maybe you\u0027ll show me your house in Boston sometime.\" \"Our house,\" he corrected, and slipped an arm around her waist. She rested her head on his shoulder. \"I really love the ring.\" \"I\u0027m really relieved.\" \"What\u0027s the stone? Blue topaz?\" \"Blue diamond,\" he corrected. \"I thought it would bring out your eyes. And the setting is platinum.\" Whoa. So, instantly, ten times more expensive than her estimate. Well, okay. She loved the ring. All the more so because it meant David had finally started paying attention. \"I didn\u0027t know there were blue diamonds.\" \"They\u0027re rare. Like you.\" \"Oh, David, that\u0027s so ... God, that\u0027s really... just so...\" They stopped walking; his face was coming closer, his hand was sliding through her hair, gripping the back of her neck, his lips parted, she leaned toward him, and— \"Ah-hem!\" David jerked back. Christina glared. \"What?\" \"Your rooms, sir. My lady. As in, why don\u0027t you get a room. Well, here it is.\" \"Hilarious,\" she said sourly. Big surprise, the rooms were huge, gorgeous, amazing, wonderful, blah-blah. She had a moment of blushing confusion when she looked at the king-sized bed—if she had to live with this sexual tension much longer, the prince was going to be raped on his wedding night. But overall the suite—\"apartments,\" they called them—were terrific. There was a large bedroom the size of the average American\u0027s living room, a palatial bathroom done in golds and (sigh) a sealife motif, a small kitchen where she could whip up some snacks, two offices (what the hell she was expected to do in hers she had no idea), and a small living room with a fireplace and big, plush couches. \"Edmund, it\u0027s wonderful,\" David was saying. \"You\u0027ve outdone yourself.\" \"Then it\u0027s an ordinary day, Highness. I\u0027m pleased you\u0027re pleased.\" \"Yeah, it\u0027s great.. . urn, what am I supposed to do in my office?\" \"Whatever you want,\" David said, looking surprised at the question. \"Uh-huh. And what are you going to do in yours?\" \"My work,\" he replied seriously. \"An addendum to Nesting Habits of Aptenodytespatagonicus?\" \"You remembered the name of my paper!\" he cried, so delighted he gave her a squeeze. \"Dull. But y\u0027know, David, it\u0027s great that you\u0027re doing all this research and stuff, and I\u0027m glad your papers are getting published because you work really hard on them, but what am I supposed to do? I don\u0027t have a job anymore, and you guys wouldn\u0027t let me cook for large numbers anyway... shit, I can barely get the cooks to let me make myself a sandwich. What\u0027s my job? There\u0027s got to be more to it than \u0027crown princess of Alaska.\u0027 Right?\" \"Dad will probably start training both of us on the day-to-day running of the country.\" She tried not to look appalled. \"The legislature does most of it,\" Edmund added. \"But the sovereign—or sovereigns, in our case—has some duties, official and otherwise.\" \"Oh.\" \"Alaska is large,\" Edmund reminded her, \"but its population is small. So you won\u0027t be christening boats or snipping ribbons on new buildings terribly often.\" \"It\u0027s nothing to worry about,\" David said. Then he frowned. \"Okay, that\u0027s not exactly true. But it\u0027s nothing you can\u0027t handle—how\u0027s that?\" \"Slightly less terrifying.\" \"My lady, trust me on this if in nothing else: you would not be marrying the prince in thirty-seven days if the king had found you wanting. The fact that you\u0027re still here bodes well... for all of us.\" \"Swell. I don\u0027t suppose I can fire the cook and take over his job, can I?\" \"No. Besides, I hate to see a grown man cry,\" Edmund said, glancing at his watch. \"Particularly before dinnertime.\" Hours later, she found the family plot. It was set on the far eastern edge of the palace property, practically in the lake. It was, as she expected, beautiful. What in Alaska wasn\u0027t? Shoot, living in this place was like living in a glossy travel magazine. She ignored the pressing feeling of not belonging. Like it or not (and she liked it. . . she was pretty sure . .. ), this was soon to be her family. She had as much right to be here as anybody. More, maybe. Even if they hadn\u0027t invited her. Even if they\u0027d gone off and left her—and was she a part of this family or wasn\u0027t she? Maybe not. Queen Dara\u0027s mausoleum was set between two soaring trees and, even with twilight coming on, looked sedate rather than scary. Christina sat cross-legged on the small hill behind the stone building, and thought about dead queens. I must be out of my mind. One day I\u0027ll be queen and then I\u0027ll die and they\u0027ll stick me back here. What was I thinking about? This is no place for me. Then her forthright nature reasserted itself. To paraphrase JFK, if not her, who? Sure, she didn\u0027t have the pedigree for the job, but that didn\u0027t mean she couldn\u0027t be great. Well, adequate. \"That\u0027s my goal,\" she said aloud, watching the grass wave. \"Adequacy. All right, then.\" She stayed by the mausoleum for a long time. Chapter 21 \" One-two-three, one-two-three, one-two-three—\" \"Ow!\" Princess Alexandria complained. \"You stomped my foot again, you klutzy cow!\" \"One more bovine insult,\" Christina warned through gritted teeth—she was still counting in her head—\"and you\u0027re the only Alaskan princess with dentures.\" \"Well, pay attention!\" \"—two-three, one-two-three—\" \"Owwwwww! Will you for Christ\u0027s sakes let me lead?\" \"No.\" \"Edmund, why are you letting her lead?\" Alexandria cried. \"My brother\u0027s not going to let her lead, you can be damned sure of that.\" \"—two-three, one—because I like to live dangerously, Your Highness—two-three, one-two-three, one-two-three—\" \"Edmund!\" \"Stop bitching and count,\" Christina said. \"I can\u0027t count—I\u0027m distracted by the fact that my shoes are filling up with blood.\" \"Look—I gotta learn to waltz. And if I danced with Edmund, I wouldn\u0027t be able to see past his belly button.\" \"Why isn\u0027t David in here teaching you?\" \"One-two-three, one-two-three, one-two-three— because His Highness already knows how to waltz.\" \"Well, so does my Highness.\" \"Yeah,\" Christina said, \"but I want to be able to surprise Dave with my waltzing virtuosity.\" \"So, you\u0027re using a stunt-waltzer?\" \"Shut up and count.\" \"I hate you.\" \"One-two-three, one-two-three—we all do, Your Highness—one-two-three ...\" Alex\u0027s dark blue eyes—so like David\u0027s—flashed dangerously. \"It occurs to me that I outrank everyone in this room,\" she declared. \"So I\u0027m just about done with the tootsie torture.\" \"I can kick your ass and you know it.\" Christina swooped across the room with Alex. \"Hey, I think I\u0027m getting the hang of this!\" \"You aren\u0027t. Trust me. Where\u0027s your bodyguard? Isn\u0027t it his job to enter into dangerous situations with you?\" \"The last time I danced with Kurt, I kicked him in the balls.\" \"And... turn!\" \"Get out!\" Alex gasped. \"Seriously?\" \"Uh-huh. So he\u0027s understandably nervous about dancing with me again.\" \"He\u0027s gorgeous.\" \"He knows it, too, so watch out. Once you get past the \u0027I\u0027m too sexy for my shirt\u0027 bush-wah, he\u0027s a pretty nice guy.\" \"Better friend than lover, huh?\" \"Exactly.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-21.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together?
