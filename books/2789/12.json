You\u0027re acting like this is fun for me. And leggo.\" Christina wriggled until Edmund\u0027s skeletal fingers fell away from her shoulder. \"Got news—this is about as much fun as commercial fishing. In fact, I would rather be commercial fishing.\" The florist swallowed and, when she spoke, her bream was redolent of Turns. \"Margie Sims, m\u0027lady.\" \"Hi, there. Nice to meet you. Well, let\u0027s get to it, Margie m\u0027girl.\" \"Yes, my lady,\" Margie said, slumping across from Christina as if going to her doom. \"I\u0027ve brought several photos of my past—what\u0027s that noise?\" \"The king fell asleep,\" Prince David whispered. \"Again.\" \"Oh.\" Marge lowered her voice. \"If any of these catches your fancy, Lady Christina, we can—uh— perhaps if you looked a little more carefully, you might find ... um ...\" Flip. Flip. Flip. \"No—tulips will cost a friggin\u0027 fortune that time of year.\" \"You mean spring?\" David asked doubtfully. \"You hush. This is pretty, but it\u0027s too delicate for me—has it escaped anyone\u0027s noticed that I\u0027m a blond hulk?\" \"Now, my lady, that\u0027s just not so,\" Marge said kindly. \"You\u0027re slender and quite lovely. But you are of striking height and coloring, and you\u0027re quite right, no one would see such a diminutive violet bouquet.\" \"Hear that, Eds?\" Christina said triumphantly. \"Marge says I\u0027m right! Eh? No, these are all too small. And this is too Thanksgiving-ish. Oooh, now this I like!\" It was a large cluster of old-fashioned roses in a rainbow of pastels. \"Except for the colors. Oooh, this is nice, too!\" Again, a cluster of roses. \"Except it\u0027s in a heart-shape—hello, cliche, anyone? You know what I like, Margie?\" she asked, turning to the woman, who now had beads of sweat on her upper lip. \"I really like irises. Dark purple irises. Which would go with the dresses. And if we could stick some big red roses in there ...\" \"Easily done, my lady.\" \"But don\u0027t make it too heavy. I\u0027m gonna have to lug it around all day, okay?\" \"Yes, my lady.\" \"Okay. Next?\" \"The caterer,\" Horrance whispered, terrified. \"Great,\" David muttered. \"We\u0027ll be able to settle on a menu by sundown, at the latest.\" \"This is Don Musch, my lady,\" Edmund said, bringing over another tall, strapping Alaskan, this one with blond hair caught back in a ponytail. He looked like he\u0027d be more at home splitting timber than whipping up souffles. \"He\u0027ll be the head caterer.\" Christina slapped the last sketchbook closed and cleared her throat. \"Okay, Don-o, listen up. I want nice, light drinks... real lemonade, some sherbet punch—orange sherbet, not lime or pineapple— maybe a nice honeydew punch, too—and use frozen fruit for ice cubes, or it\u0027ll be a watered-down mess before we get to \u0027I do.\u0027 And I\u0027d like Bellinis, please— that\u0027s champagne with apricot nectar, to you non-Americans. Not orange juice—mimosas are such a cliche. Plus, I had to make about a zillion a day on the ships .. . I\u0027m not having them at my reception. \"For hors d\u0027oeuvres I want a nice variety of open-faced sandwiches, maybe some cucumber and watercress, cream cheese, and you can dress it up with caviar, sesame seeds, whatever. Some nice crostini would be good, too, but make sure the tomatoes are ripe ... I don\u0027t want a bunch of red potatoes served with the mozzarella. Actually, yellow tomatoes would be really great with that, if you think you can get them. They\u0027re so pretty. And fresh basil, please, nothing out of ajar. \"Some asparagus, maybe steamed and served with a really tangy vinaigrette, would be good, too. No need to go for the white—green asparagus will do fine. And shrimp cocktail. I love shrimp cocktail, and I bet you guys could get a great price. \"Now, for entrees, let\u0027s do some poached salmon— no halibut, it\u0027s too friggin\u0027 expensive—and serve it with a nice homemade mayo, maybe some cukes, too. Do not make a salmon mousse—I don\u0027t expect the guests to choke down whipped fish. I\u0027d also like to do a couple different pasta salads, one with meat, one without. I mean, there\u0027s gonna be some vegetarians there—be nice if they had something to eat, too. \"A cheese course would be good, but only if you can protect it from the heat. . . nothing worse than sweaty cheese.\" \"Nothing worse?\" David asked, managing to get a word in edgewise. \"I\u0027d also like lots of fruit—I love fruit. Minted melon balls, strawberries, and a really good fruit dip—try two parts cream cheese to one part marshmallow fluff—that\u0027s good stuff. Melon wrapped in prosciutto would be good, too—yum! Oh, and lots of crusty bread, and I\u0027ve got a great recipe for strawberry butter. It sounds weird, but it\u0027s actual) very good. Especially if you can keep the rolls warm.\" Don, the caterer, was managing to take rapid notes, while everyone else\u0027s jaws were hanging open. Even the king had awakened and was paying attention. \"Now, dessert. I do not, repeat, do not want colored Crisco on the wedding cake. Real butter cream, please. I want a multi-tiered cake, and I\u0027d like each tier to be a different flavor. Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, mocha, lemon. Something for everybody. Fillings can be fruit, mousse, whatever, but again, no colored Crisco. And I\u0027d like a pearl-ized fondant to decorate the cake, and have each layer be a different color. You know—blue, orange, pink, green, yellow, whatever. You can pipe swirls over the fondant to create a what-d\u0027you-call-it?—a Wedgewood effect. My mom,\" she finished defiantly, \"loved Wedgewood.\" \"Gaaaaaaah,\" Marge said, trying and failing to articulate her startlement. \"Oh, and I\u0027ve got a great idea for Penguin Boy\u0027s groom cake ... we could do a chocolate cake with white fondant icing and cut out black fondant in the shape of playing card symbols—you know, decorate it with aces, hearts, spades, clubs. It\u0027d be really dramatic and kind of fitting, too, because of the black and white, you know? Anyway, we can have that the night before, and on the big day, the tiered cake. And a Croquembouche. It\u0027s so pretty, and so good. I love cream puffs. I know it\u0027ll be a pain, but I\u0027ll help. \"Anyway,\" Christina said into the dead silence, \"those are my ideas. And whatever David wants to eat, too.\" \"Of course!\" David burst out. \"She\u0027s a chef!\" \"I\u0027m a cook,\" she corrected. \"Chefs go to school.\" \"This—this is all very fine, my lady,\" Don said, still scribbling furiously. \"Nice and specific, you mean, you lucky bastard,\" Marge muttered. \"Okay. And don\u0027t worry, Don, I\u0027ll help.\" \"My lady, that\u0027s really not—\" \"Oh, I want to! With the cakes, at least. What\u0027s left? All this food talk has me starving.\" \"Me, too!\" the king said. \"I\u0027m ready to go for some of that croakembooch right now.\" \"Just some minor details . . . transportation—\" \"Where? I thought we agreed the wedding would be here.\" \"Yes, Lady Christina, but the people will want to see you,\" Edmund explained. \"I thought we could use the royal carriage—\" \"Forget it.\" \"How come?\" David asked. \"It\u0027s romantic. Isn\u0027t it\u0027\" \"Trotting behind a steaming horse butt? Pass.\" \"I, uh, never thought of it that w-way,\" David said, his voice almost breaking on \"way\" as he choked back a laugh. \"And on that note,\" Edmund sighed, \"I suggest we adjourn for the day.\" \"Good call,\" Christina said. \"I\u0027m missing Jeopardy.\" Chapter 13 She had no idea where they were—closets weren\u0027t as big as living rooms, right? But what other room was bulging with coats on hangers? Anyway, they were groping and she heard a seam tear and then she was clawing at the clothes for purchase, finding the pole beneath the furs and hanging on for dear life as David\u0027s tongue parted her lower lips and slipped inside her. He was on his knees in front of her, his big hands on her thighs, spreading them apart, as he licked and teased and kissed and stroked, and she thought she was going to scream. She must have made a sound, some sound, because he said, \"Shhhhh,\" against her slick flesh, and she whimpered in reply. His tongue sped up, no longer leisurely licking, finding the quivering button that was the very center of her, sucking it, licking, stabbing at it, and her uterus clenched as her orgasm bloomed within her, as fire raced down her limbs and she let go of the pole, tumbling to the floor of the closet in a heap of furs. His mouth was instantly on hers and she tasted herself; she was groping wildly for him, found him, felt him sliding inside her with delicious slowness, came again as he started to thrust, cried out in his mourn. They still had their shirts on (and their shoes) but his hand found her left breast and squeezed it through the cotton, and through it all his mouth never left hers, not once, and he shuddered above her when she came again, as if he could feel it, as if they were reading each other\u0027s minds. \"Is it me, or is it sort of depraved to do that before we go see a minister?\" \"Oh, it\u0027s just you,\" he said seriously, then laughed when she tickled his ribs. \"Are you sure you wouldn\u0027t rather go find that closet again? Those furs felt awesome! And a cedar closet! Yum! What floor was that, anyway? We\u0027ve got to make a mental note of that room ...\" \"We\u0027ve defiled it enough for one day.\" \"Nice! Defiled! Hey, I\u0027d prefer to do it in a bed like a regular person ...\" A rather large lie. David was fiendishly inventive in closed spaces. \"... but if we did, we\u0027d give Nicholas a real education. Or one of your sisters. Or the king would burst in, or—yech!—Edmund. Or Jenny. Or—\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-12.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together?
