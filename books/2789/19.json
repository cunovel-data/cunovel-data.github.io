David, however, remained a stone. \"Christina fell,\" he improvised. \"I just came out to help her.\"\\n\\n Edmund held up her shirt. \"Quite a fall, since her shirt was on the chair inside.\"\\n\\n \"It was like—a whirlwind?\" she guessed.\\n\\n Alex snickered as Edmund went on implacably, like a majordomo Terminator. \"Do tell. There is a slice of bread on the ceiling.\"\\n\\n \"I was saving it for later?\"\\n\\n David collapsed in laughter, actually rolling around the grass. She kicked him, then stood up, climbed the balcony, retrieved her shirt from a glacial Edmund, ignored Alex\u0027s leer, and set about cleaning up the room.\\n\\n Chapter 19\\n\\n Christina sailed into Dr. Pohl\u0027s office, tossed her coat toward the coatrack (she missed, and it landed on the floor), then flopped onto the couch with a satisfying smack. She laced her fingers behind her head, stared at the ceiling, and said, \"Ah, I can feel the sweet embrace of sanity already.\"\\n\\n \"Well, well, if it isn\u0027t the tattooed lady.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s nice,\" she said, then laughed. \"It\u0027s impossible to keep a secret in that place, you know.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re in a good mood,\" Dr. Pohl observed. \"Also, you\u0027re late.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, a princess-in-waiting has stuff to do, Doc. Don\u0027t take it personal. And why shouldn\u0027t I be in a good mood? Spring\u0027s here—\"\\n\\n \"And with it, your wedding.\"\\n\\n \"—the grass has riz, I wonder where the flowers is? And all that. Also, did I tell you? Met a friend in Boston and David invited him to visit! We\u0027ve been having gobs of fun.\"\\n\\n \"Have you decided on a ring yet, \u0027midst the gobs of fun?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re such a buzz kill,\" Christina muttered. She sat up and swung her legs over the side of the couch. \"Look, it\u0027s not as easy as all that.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" Dr. Pohl said, prominently displaying her own engagement and wedding rings.\\n\\n \"Get those rocks away from me. First of all, I had to nicely refuse Queen Dara\u0027s jewelry without hurting anybody\u0027s feelings, which was so not a walk in the park, believe me.\"\\n\\n \"They offered you the queen\u0027s wedding jewels?\"\\n\\n \"She had, like, buckets of the stuff. Ropes of pearls. Piles of diamonds. So that was a mess, you know?\"\\n\\n \"You had to call on all your powers of tact.\"\\n\\n \"Damn straight.\"\\n\\n \"Powers so secret and well hidden, most of us assumed they didn\u0027t exist.\"\\n\\n \"I hate you. Look, the idea of wearing a dead lady\u0027s—a dead queen\u0027s—jewelry creeps me out, okay? Tell the truth, wouldn\u0027t you feel a little funny wearing a dead monarch\u0027s rings?\"\\n\\n \"I never thought about it,\" Dr. Pohl admitted.\\n\\n \"Well, think about it and get back to me. Anyway. So, we put that issue to bed, finally. But all the rings the jewelers have been bringing to the palace, they\u0027ve just been—I dunno—\"\\n\\n \"Not suitable?\"\\n\\n \"Completely very much not suitable. Half of them, you need a crane to get \u0027em on your finger! Come on—who needs an eight-carat diamond? I could never put on another pair of pantyhose, not as long as I lived. And I\u0027m a cook—anybody keep that in mind?\" she griped. \"A big-ass ring is just gonna get in my way. D\u0027you know how hard it is to get butter out of jewelry settings?\"\\n\\n \"Some people,\" Dr. Pohl said carefully, \"might interpret your refusal—\"\\n\\n \"Refusal!\"\\n\\n \"—to choose a ring as evidence that you don\u0027t truly wish to get married, and make a life here.\"\\n\\n \"Well, those people ought to give it a rest. It\u0027s got nothing to do with David. That\u0027s not the important stuff—diamonds and gold and stuff like that—it\u0027s not. It\u0027s got nothing to do with David.\" Had she said that already? It was hard to remember. She\u0027d been in a great mood two minutes ago, and now she was massively stressed out. Sweating, even!\\n\\n \"Really? Because an objective observer might jump to the conclusion that it has everything to do with David.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if he wants to marry me so bad, how come he keeps coming up with these rings that are so totally not me? Huh? Well, how come?\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to hit me?\" Dr. Pohl asked curiously.\\n\\n \"Not today. But listen. It\u0027s like, after all this time—\"\\n\\n \"What time?\" Pohl asked, her eyebrows arching like white wings. \"You haven\u0027t even been here half a year yet.\"\\n\\n \"Regardless,\" Christina said stubbornly, \"he doesn\u0027t know me at all. He\u0027s the one who doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s important,\" she finished triumphantly.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ve made how many trips to Penguin Hall since your engagement? In the interest of getting to know your future spouse?\"\\n\\n Sullen silence, followed by, \"I\u0027m getting to know him, Dr. Pohl, don\u0027t you worry about that.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sex,\" she said, waving it away with her hand. \"Sure. Real intimacy there.\"\\n\\n \"Well, there is! And shouldn\u0027t you be, I dunno, shocked or something?\"\\n\\n \"That you\u0027ve seen what you wanted and are going about getting it? Yes, very shocking, and terribly out of character.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sneaking around the Sitka Palace,\" she practically shouted, \"boinking the heir to the crown!\"\\n\\n \"Darling, I\u0027m not your mother. I don\u0027t care. Listen, Christina, if gold and diamonds aren\u0027t important, then what is?\"\\n\\n \"Family,\" she said promptly.\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re marrying into a group of strangers. Is that family? You\u0027ve explained your motivations, and they\u0027re fine, if a little bloodless—\"\\n\\n \"Hey!\"\\n\\n \"—but isn\u0027t there at least a part of you who wants to marry Prince David because you want him for himself? In the way you hope he—and his family— wants you for yourself ?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting a headache.\" Then, grudgingly, \"I like him, if that\u0027s what you mean.\"\\n\\n \"Just like? There\u0027s still time, you know,\" Dr. Pohl said gently. \"You can call everything off, go back to your own life.\"\\n\\n Horrified, Christina shook her head. \"I\u0027d never do that!\"\\n\\n \"Never?\"\\n\\n \"Besides, it\u0027s too late.\"\\n\\n \"Not until you say \u0027I do,\u0027 hon.\"\\n\\n \"Stop calling me that—I never know if you mean \u0027short for honey\u0027 or \u0027Attila the.\u0027 Besides . . . I\u0027m—I\u0027m getting kind of spoiled.\"\\n\\n \"Servants fighting to meet your every whim?\"\\n\\n \"No! Yech! I broke \u0027em of that in a hurry, let me tell you. But... at least at the palace, I\u0027m not so fucking lonesome all the time, you know? I mean, if David\u0027s not bugging me about reading his latest research paper on Aptenodytespatagonicus—that’s Latin for king penguin, and don\u0027t I wish I didn\u0027t know that—then Nicky\u0027s hiding in my closet, or Alex—that\u0027s the Princess Alex, not the Prince Alex—is bugging me to come sketching with her, or the other Alex wants me to try my hand at haikus—d\u0027you know he only talks in haiku?—or the king wants to take me fishing, or—well—it\u0027s kind of nice. I mean, even if David can\u0027t get my ring right, they\u0027ve—\"\\n\\n \"Accepted you.\"\\n\\n \"Well, yeah. I couldn\u0027t turn my back on them after they did that. Opened their home—and their family!—to a nobody like me.\"\\n\\n \"I understand you had a strong hand in planning the food for the wedding reception.\"\\n\\n \"Well, sure.\" Christina wrinkled her brow. \"I\u0027m a cook. I\u0027m into food. So I wanted the food to be good—that\u0027s not such a big deal.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s true, but another way to look at it—\"\\n\\n \"Oh, here we go.\"\\n\\n \"—is that you don\u0027t dare to care about the wedding—and subsequent marriage—too much because you can\u0027t afford to take it seriously.\"\\n\\n She shifted in her chair. \"What crap.\"\\n\\n \"So an impartial observer,\" Dr. Pohl said carefully, \"would surmise you\u0027re involved in the food to give the illusion of being interested in the wedding, when really you\u0027re only protecting yourself.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you heard me the first time,\" Christina said, \"so listen up. What crap!\"\\n\\n \"My lady—\"\\n\\n \"Watch it with that.\"\\n\\n \"—I\u0027ve never known someone so dumb and so smart at the same time.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"And with that,\" Dr. Pohl said, \"I think we\u0027re done with the week.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, come on! You can\u0027t say all that cryptic stuff and then refuse to explain it!\"\\n\\n \"Sure I can, especially when it\u0027s not cryptic at all—you know exactly what I\u0027m talking about. Arrive on time next week, and perhaps I will be able to elaborate.\"\\n\\n \"Fucking shrinks,\" she muttered.\\n\\n \"Yes, we\u0027re really annoying that way,\" Dr. Pohl said cheerfully. \"Say hello to your ex-boyfriend for me.\"\\n\\n Christina got up and grabbed her coat. \"I said he was a friend—I never told you he was an ex. You\u0027ve got spies everywhere, don\u0027t you, Doc?\"\\n\\n \"All shrinks do. We get a pack of them when we graduate from medical school.\"\\n\\n \"You know, I really can\u0027t stand you.\" But she couldn\u0027t keep the smile off her face when she said it.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m well aware, dear. See you next week.\"\\n\\n Kurt was waiting for her in the lobby. Me and my shadow, Christina thought wryly. It was comforting that he thought it was as hilarious as she did.\\n\\n \"How\u0027d it go, cutie?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, the usual psychobabble bullshit. And don\u0027t call me \u0027cutie.\u0027 \" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-19.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) \\n In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together? And will the palace still be standing when the dust clears?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:54 PM"}}
