And great of the prince,\" he added with a nod at said prince fellow, who looked like he was chewing on lemon peel, \"to invite me.\"\n \"Yeah. Well, listen, about that—where\u0027s your sidearm?\"\n \"In my apartment back in L.A.,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t worry, I didn\u0027t smuggle any firearms into your country.\"\n \"Dammit!\"\n Kurt blinked. The king turned to Edmund. \"Get him fixed up.\"\n \"At once, Majesty.\"\n Kurt\u0027s hand was swallowed again. \"Nice meeting you, Kurt. You have any problems or questions, let me or Edmund know.\"\n \"Or even,\" Edmund said, \"Edmund or me. If you wish to be grammatically correct.\"\n \"Uh, thanks, Mr.—uh—king.\"\n With a wave, the king took off, leaving him with the skinny guy, and his archrival.\n \"Are your quarters satisfactory?\" his evil nemesis asked politely.\n \"Yeah, dude, they\u0027re fine.\"\n \"This is a key card which will get you into the shooting range, anytime. A member of our security team will assist you in selecting a firearm. The king signed your carry permit this morning. All we ask is that when you\u0027re escorting Lady Christina—\"\n \"Keep an eye out for the bad guys,\" Kurt said, instantly understanding everything. What luck! What total fucking luck! He practically snatched the key card. \"No sweat. Hey, nobody\u0027s gonna mess with my ex-girlfriend, unless it\u0027s me.\"\n Nobody laughed at his (admittedly lame) little joke.\n \"So you let me come back with you, and now you\u0027re giving me a gun and letting me practice on it, and letting me hang out with your—with Christina. You must really want us to get back together,\" he joked.\n \"Ah ... well... I know you aren\u0027t here to try to win her back, so to speak, and—\"\n \"Actually, dude, I kind of am,\" he said, half apologetically. He cursed his hippie mother for instilling him with a scrupulous sense of honesty. \"I mean, you seem like a nice guy and all, but this whole palace gig—it\u0027s just not for the Chris I know. It\u0027s just not. And I\u0027m hoping she\u0027ll remember that if we hang out enough.\"\n \"Detective Carlson, that is entirely inappropriate behavior,\" Edmund said.\n \"Damn right!\" the prince yelped.\n He shrugged. \"Sorry, dudes. That\u0027s the way it is.\"\n A bump as his rival\u0027s chest touched his. Hmm. The rival was pretty solidly built. And about three inches taller. \"Shoot your mouth off all you like,\" he growled, \"but be sure to keep your hands to yourself, or I\u0027ll cut them off.\"\n \"Oh, yeah? They still do that up here?\"\n \"Edmund! Off with his head!\"\n \"Sadly, Your Highness, I left my axe in my other pants.\"\n \"Well, start carrying one,\" the prince snapped, then stormed out.\n \"Uh ... he was kidding, right? I mean, I read up on the guy. He\u0027s a marine biologist or a zookeeper or something.\"\n \"Yes, of course, sir. A marine biologist descended from a royal family known for cutting the Gordian knot as opposed to untying it.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what that means.\"\n \"It means,\" Edmund said, just before his more restrained exit, \"welcome to Alaska.\"\n \"How,\" Prince David demanded by way of greeting, \"could your tattoo have escaped my notice?\"\n Christina paused in mid-chomp, then put her tomato sandwich back on the plate. She\u0027d successfully seen Kurt tucked into his room and decided to treat herself to a snack. She was eating in one of the sunrooms, the one with the view of the ocean, today a mild slice of blue in the distance. The tomato was a rich, ripe red—a good trick for this time of the year—and drippy. She wiped her chin with her forearm and asked, \"What bit you on the ass today?\"\n \"Note how she didn\u0027t answer my question.\"\n \"What I\u0027m noting is that you\u0027ve picked up Eds\u0027s icky habit of referring to me in the third person. And it\u0027s a fine question—how did my tattoo escape your notice?\"\n \"Well...\" He sat down across from her, oblivious to the drenching beauty of the scene. As usual, she was momentarily distracted by his extreme yumminess. \"We\u0027re usually in a hurry—\"\n \"Because you never know when Nicky or Al or Alex or Alex or Jenny or Eds will burst in on us— so not conducive to horniness, by the way.\"\n \"—and it\u0027s usually dark—\"\n \"And cramped,\" Christina added, smiling. \"And sometimes furry. I still say we find that closet again.\"\n He looked distracted, then shook himself. \"So, where is it?\"\n \"You\u0027re asking me? I still need a map to find the bathroom.\"\n \"I mean,\" he said through gritted teeth, \"your tattoo.\"\n \"Oh, dear.\" She picked up her sandwich and took a bite. \"After all those closet gropings, you have to ask?\"\n He slumped back in his chair and stared out the window. \"Well, if you don\u0027t want to tell me ...\"\n \"It\u0027s not so much that I don\u0027t want to tell you, it\u0027s that I think you should find out for your— yeeeek!\" The plate went flying, her tomato slices parted ways with the bread, her chair slammed back onto the floor, her legs went over her head, and then he was nuzzling her neck and groping under her shirt. \"Subtlety, thy name is not—that tickles!\" Her legs sticking up in the air as they were, it was difficult to get leverage to fend him off. Not that she entirely wanted to. Still, her pride was at stake. \"David, for God\u0027s sake, it\u0027s noon and the door to the sunroom\u0027s wide open and we\u0027re not exactly well—hidden—God, your fingers are cold!\" A horrid thought crossed her mind. \"You didn\u0027t come from the penguins to me, did you, you fucking pervert?\"\n He\u0027d pulled her shirt over her head and seemed temporarily stymied by her bra—ha! Back clasps. \"No,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just chilly in here today.\"\n Not for much longer! Yow. \"David,\" she giggled into his throat, \"will you cut it out? I\u0027ll tell you, all right?\"\n \"Kurt knows,\" he muttered, peeking under a bra strap.\n \"Ancient history, Penguin Boy, and we already had this conversation, remember? What, it\u0027s my fault you\u0027ve been in such a hurry to get some that you never bothered to look for distinctive markings?\"\n He scowled at her. \"So you\u0027re saying it\u0027s my fault you went out and got yourself marked with permanent ink like some sort of biker lady?\"\n \"Chick, David, biker chick, and no, but the only reason you\u0027re in here with your cold fingers is because you\u0027re mad at Kurt.\" She pushed her hair out of her face to give him a glare of her own. \"Which is so totally dumb, by the way, I mean— why\u0027d you invite him in the first place?\"\n He muttered something she couldn\u0027t quite catch, then they both froze when they heard footsteps. He kicked the chair, which wobbled back upright, snapped open the lock on the French door, and hauled her out onto the balcony. He glanced down, observed the four-foot drop, then booted her over.\n \"My sandwich!\" she wailed on the way down.\n He landed beside her in a crouch and tackled her. Cripes! At least the grass was warm. The few patches that had escaped the snow! Fucking ten-month Alaskan winters . . .\n \"Not to mention your shirt,\" he said, and whatever weird mood he\u0027d been in seemed to have passed, because he was grinning at her. \"Now let\u0027s hope whoever it is doesn\u0027t look out the window.\"\n \"They\u0027re gonna be too busy peeling tomato slices off the wall.\" She shivered in the chill spring air. \"You owe me lunch, buckaroo.\"\n \"Done and done.\" He peeked into her cleavage.\n \"For God\u0027s sake.\" She sat up, shoved him away, presented her back to him, and unsnapped her bra.\n There was a long silence, followed by his \"Oh.\"\n \"See it?\"\n \"Hmm.\"\n \"Happy now?\"\n \"It\u0027s an albatross.\"\n \"Congratulations, Dr. Baranov, those years of college when you never had sex appear to have paid off.\" She snapped her bra again and started to stand, but he held her down with a hand. Weirdly, he was still frowning.\n \"An albatross, Christina.\"\n \"Yes, David, I know, I\u0027m the one who paid for it,\" she said patiently. Why was he looking at her so strangely? \"Anybody who tells you tattoos don\u0027t hurt is a fucking liar, by the way. I figured, smack in the middle of my back, where my bra strap hides it, something small—and it still hurt!\"\n \"A royal albatross, in fact.\"\n \"Now, don\u0027t go reading too much into this,\" she warned.\n His eyes were faraway and he wasn\u0027t looking at her anymore, he was staring at the sea. \"It\u0027s a large seabird that regularly circles the globe.\"\n \"Are you channeling Marlin Perkins now?\"\n He ignored her interruption. \"In fact, it\u0027s a seabird famous for never lingering long in one place. In fact, it spends only about a tenth of its life on land .. . the rest of the time it\u0027s on the move.\"\n \"Also, it\u0027s pretty and I liked the black specks on the wings. David, will you lighten up?\"\n He blinked and looked at her. \"Sure,\" he said. \"I was just surprised. It\u0027s very pretty.\"\n \"Well, thanks.\"\n He kissed her, his tongue tracing her lower lip before delving inside, and she slipped her arms around his broad shoulders. Boy oh boy, it was too bad they were out on the lawn where God and everybody could see them, because she—\n \"Ah-hem!\"\n They looked up. Edmund had the glass door open and was scowling down at them from the balcony. Prince Alex, looking very surprised, was standing beside him.\n \"That\u0027s it,\" David whispered in her ear. \"My erection has utterly vanished.\"\n She giggled as Edmund said, \"Really, Your Highness. My lady.\"\n Prince Alex cleared his throat.\n \"The quest for nookie \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-18.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) \n In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together? And will the palace still be standing when the dust clears?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:54 PM"}}
