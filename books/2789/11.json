We can have the ceremony in the main ballroom, and have the reception on the grounds.\"\\n\\n \"Better have a Plan B,\" the king warned, propping his feet up on the table. \"What if the weather\u0027s shitty?\"\\n\\n \"I will work on a Plan B,\" Edmund promised, making a note on his clipboard. \"Very well, then. Next?\"\\n\\n Emboldened, the dress designer stepped forward. \"Horrance Tyler, my lady. We met the other day.\"\\n\\n \"Hi, Horrance. Whatcha got?\"\\n\\n The stuff, Christina later thought, nightmares were made of.\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027d disappear in that thing. My goal, on my wedding day, is not to look like a big-ass meringue.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s so flattering to your coloring—\"\\n\\n \"Big-ass meringue, Horrance. Sorry. That one, too,\" she said, pointing to a perfectly lovely dress with a scalloped neckline and, yes, a rather large, full skirt and eight-foot train. \"I don\u0027t want a dress ten times as big as I am. And no train. Have you ever walked in a train, Horrance? Don\u0027t answer that Anyway, I haven\u0027t, and the day a zillion people are watching me? Not a good day to start. Next.\"\\n\\n The flipping of sketchbook pages lulled the king to sleep, and soon his gentle snores filled the room as Christina worked through the sketches.\\n\\n \"Nope. Too nunlike.\"\\n\\n \"Too much lace.\"\\n\\n \"Not enough lace.\"\\n\\n \"Too Amazonian—what\u0027s with the silver belt? Am I fighting crime after the reception?\"\\n\\n \"Too pretty.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about, too pretty?\" David said, jerked out of his own near-slumber.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too pretty for me. Too fancy, I guess is what I mean.\" She pointed. \"Look at it—silver shoulder straps! And diamonds on the bodice. I\u0027m a Wal-Mart girl, get it? Hey, Horrance, it\u0027s not personal, okay?\" she said to the designer, who was manfully fighting tears. \"They\u0027re gorgeous dresses, they really really are. They\u0027re just.. .just not me, get it?\"\\n\\n \"I get it,\" Horrance said, slightly mollified, as he grabbed the seventh sketchbook.\\n\\n \"Too plain. It\u0027d be great for a regular dance, but not for a wedding gown. It\u0027s very pretty, though,\" she added hastily.\\n\\n \"Nope. Train.\"\\n\\n \"Not much of one, my lady, it\u0027s—\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a train, Horrance. A beautiful train, but a train. Choo-choo. Next.\"\\n\\n \"Neckline\u0027s too high. I\u0027d be tugging at it all day. On camera. It\u0027s probably just—what\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n Frozen in the act of slamming the last book shut, Horrance said, \"Those are my sketches for a bridesmaid\u0027s gown, my lady.\"\\n\\n Christina pulled the book toward her and stared hungrily at the page. It was an A-line gown, strapless, with an inch-wide ribbon around the middle, right below the breasts. It was ice-blue, and came with a floor-length, off-the-shoulder cape in the same color.\\n\\n \"That.\"\\n\\n \"That?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the one. That\u0027s what I want\" She couldn\u0027t look away from the sketch. It was glorious! Plain, but beautiful.\\n\\n \"In—in that color?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Don\u0027t change a thing.\"\\n\\n Prince David chuckled. \"So. Not white.\"\\n\\n \"Drop dead, white bread. I just like the color, is all.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, but... a princess of the realm really should be married in white—\"\\n\\n The king snorted and woke up. \"Eh? What\u0027s up now?\"\\n\\n \"The lady Christina wants to get married in blue,\" Horrance tattled.\\n\\n King Alexander blinked. \"Um ... I dunno, kid, that\u0027s kind of. .. different... even for us ...\"\\n\\n The protocol officer stepped in. \"Actually, Majesty, the tradition of wearing white wedding gowns was started in England. By Queen Victoria.\"\\n\\n \"And everybody jumped on the bandwagon. The English bandwagon,\" Christina added.\\n\\n \"Well, screw that!\" the king said loudly. \"Alaskans do things their own way, dammit The kid wants blue, it\u0027s blue. Let the House of Windsor chew on that.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Al.\" Thank you! she mouthed to the protocol officer, who smiled graciously.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice,\" David said, looking at the sketch. \"It\u0027ll bring out your blue eyes.\"\\n\\n \"Her eyes are green, \"Jenny protested.\\n\\n \"You guys, focus, please? And my eyes are hazel— blue-green. Besides, I\u0027ve already given up forty-five minutes of my life I\u0027ll never get back. What\u0027s next?\"\\n\\n \"Well, the shoes should be—\"\\n\\n \"Forget it. I\u0027ll pick out a pair of nice flats the next time I\u0027m at Payless.\"\\n\\n \"I beg your pardon—you certainly will not,\" Edmund said.\\n\\n \"Watch me. Next!\"\\n\\n \"Bridemaids\u0027 gowns?\" David asked, scooching a little closer to Christina, the better to help her fend off Edmund\u0027s strangling hands.\\n\\n \"Oh. Was I going to have some of those?\"\\n\\n \"Er... what?\"\\n\\n \"Christina moved around a lot as a kid,\" David explained. \"She doesn\u0027t have a lot of close friends.\"\\n\\n \"We were dunking the princesses,\" Edmund said.\\n\\n \"Which is fine,\" Christina said, turning to David, \"but does your sister talk?\"\\n\\n \"Kamryn, you mean?\"\\n\\n \"She hasn\u0027t said two words to me the whole time I\u0027ve been here, but she keeps throwing stuff at me!\"\\n\\n \"She likes you.\"\\n\\n \"So,\" Edmund said loudly, \"the princesses.\"\\n\\n \"And Jenny,\" Christina added. Jenny\u0027s mouth popped open. \"Oh, my lady, I couldn\u0027t! It wouldn\u0027t be appropriate, it—\"\\n\\n \"No, I want you to, Jenny. You\u0027re going to work like a dog on this—why shouldn\u0027t you get some of the glory?\" Besides, the woman had really saved her bacon, stepping in with that tidbit about Queen Victoria. Talk about a true (if brand new) friend!\\n\\n \"Well, I—I would be honored, my lady.\" Jenny was flushing to the roots with pleasure. \"Really, I— my mother will be so pleased.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. You can tell Mom later. So, bridesmaids-Princess Kathryn, Princess Alexandria, Jenny. Are there any—um—does your mom—I mean, the late queen—anybody in her family that you might like—\"\\n\\n \"No,\" David said firmly.\\n\\n Long silence.\\n\\n \"Okay!\" Christina said brightly. \"Bridesmaids\u0027 gowns, right? Right. Whatcha got, Horrance? Come on, don\u0027t be scared. You can do it.\"\\n\\n \"Well. ..\"\\n\\n \"Nope. It\u0027s those high necklines again ... yech. And the color! They look like they\u0027re wearing steel.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s gray, miss. The new black.\"\\n\\n \"Black is the new black, Horrance. Um ... this is close,\" she said, tapping a picture. \"But too sparkly. And that looks like heavy material... it\u0027ll be June, not January. No bridesmaids passing out at the altar, please.\"\\n\\n \"No ballerinas, either.\"\\n\\n \"Or waiters.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"She looks like a bell. A pretty bell, but a bell. No.\"\\n\\n \"Perfect.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps if we—what?\"\\n\\n \"That one,\" she said, stabbing a finger at a midnight-blue, square-necked sheath gown. \"It\u0027s gorgeous—they can wear it again, and it\u0027ll look good on everybody because all three of my bridesmaids could stand a few milkshakes, get what I mean? Anyway, that one.\"\\n\\n \"What do you think of the hat, my lady?\"\\n\\n \"No hats. She looks like she\u0027s going to start tap dancing any minute.\"\\n\\n \"Very well,\" Horrance said, making notes with a now-shaking hand, \"no hats for the maids.\"\\n\\n \"No hats, Horrance.\"\\n\\n \"Let me just show you a few things,\" he coaxed.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a brave man, Horrance,\" Prince David commented.\\n\\n \"Thank you, Highness. How about this?\"\\n\\n \"Why would you want me to look like a Rockette? Look at all those feathers! No, thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Nor do I want to pretend to be Humphrey Bogart.\"\\n\\n \"Or the Cat in the Hat.\"\\n\\n \"No hats,\" Horrance surrendered, slapping the book shut. \"I think we can postpone our jewelry discussion for another day?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take care of that,\" Prince David said.\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah?\" Christina said, raising her eyebrows.\\n\\n \"I do have some talents besides acute knowledge of flightless waterfowl.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice to find out unexpected things about future husbands,\" she said cheerfully. \"Which reminds me, what are you going to wear?\"\\n\\n \"All the men in the royal family will be in standard tuxedos,\" Edmund announced.\\n\\n \"Oh, yes!\" Horrance said, clapping enthusiastically. \"You\u0027ll all look so dashing!\"\\n\\n \"Ugh,\" the bride commented. \"Penguins.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing wrong with looking like a penguin,\" David said, sneaking a peek at his watch.\\n\\n \"Says the obsessed! Look, do you really want to be mixed up with the waiters at our reception?\"\\n\\n Horrance giggled. David glared. Christina just raised her eyebrows and waited for an answer.\\n\\n \"Ah—my lady, Your Highness—tell me what you think of this.\" Horrance extended yet another sketchbook, and Christina and David looked down at it. It was a double-breasted tuxedo, but while the jacket and pants were deepest black, the waistcoat was a cheerful herringbone, and the tie was deep gray. \"We could match the ties to the bridesmaids\u0027 gowns,\" he suggested.\\n\\n \"Actually, it\u0027s great the way it is. That whole matching thing—I never got it. What are we, in a parade? I think this looks great.\"\\n\\n \"I do, too. Nice work, Horrance.\"\\n\\n \"Next?\"\\n\\n A plump, matronly woman with brutally short, salt-and-pepper hair and an intriguing eggplant-colored pantsuit stepped forward, cheeks bulging with chewable antacid. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-11.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) \\n In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together? And will the palace still be standing when the dust clears?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:54 PM"}}
