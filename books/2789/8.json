Is there time to cancel this thing yet?\" She heard a light tap at her door and groaned into her pillow. After a moment, she rolled over and said, \"Nicholas! It\u0027s after midnight, you little twerp! Enough of these weird, late-night excursions! Go to sleep!\" A head poked into the room. Not Nicholas\u0027s. \"Remind me to have a talk with the royal twerp,\" David said. \"Although I can hardly blame him for being unable to stay away. May I come in?\" \"What is it with you people? Don\u0027t any of you need sleep?\" \"We take long naps in the morning.\" He stepped into the room. \"Interesting day today, hmm?\" \"If you say so. But if I have to look at one more peau de soie shoe, I\u0027m going to barf. What the hell is peau de soie, anyway?\" \"You\u0027re asking me? And there\u0027s no way your shoes are going to be less comfortable than mine.\" She laughed as he sat down on the edge of her bed, and propped herself up on her elbows. \"Since I plan to wear flats—and I thought the designer dude was going to cry when I told him—I\u0027ll give you that one. And d\u0027you know what\u0027s worse? This was just, like, preliminary stuff. We\u0027re going to have meetings and meetings, every day. Flowers, shoes, dresses, food, cakes, time, place, shoes—\" \"While we\u0027re on the topic of fashion ...\" She could see him a little better now, in spite of the room\u0027s gloom, and once again wondered if his hair would feel like it looked .. . like coarse silk. \"What\u0027s this about a white wedding gown?\" \"Oh, are we gonna do that? Because the time to do that was before you asked me to marry you.\" \"I\u0027m just curious,\" he said mildly. \"Sure you are. Let\u0027s put it this way: I\u0027m not a virgin, but I\u0027m not a slut, either.\" \"You can\u0027t know,\" he said, perfectly straight-faced, \"how relieved I am.\" \"Listen up, wise guy—I can count the number of partners I\u0027ve had on one hand.\" She paused and added pointedly, \"Can you?\" \"Ah .. . not on one hand, no ... in fact, I think I might need a third hand . . . maybe .. . and possibly a few of my toes ...\" \"Hypocrite!\" \"Well, I am six years older than you. Oof!\" He said \"oof!\" because she\u0027d swung her pillow, sidearm, into his face. \"Ah-ha! Now the truth comes out— you\u0027re going to be an abusive wife, I can sense it.\" \"Sure I am. Look, if you really want chapter and verse, we can do that. I mean .. . you\u0027re right, it\u0027s a fair question. But I expect reciprocation.\" He shook his head. \"No need.\" \"Chickenshit.\" \"No, it\u0027s like I said, I was just curious. It\u0027s in the past, it has nothing to do with me, or us, and besides that, it\u0027s your own personal business. That\u0027s not the main reason I came in here, anyway.\" \"Yeah? Other than keeping me from much-deserved sleep, what are you doing here?\" \"I like teasing you. It\u0027s .. . something different. Your reaction, I mean.\" \"Super. Listen, not that this isn\u0027t fascinating and all...\" \"You’re fascinating.\" Was he leaning in? He was! The lean-in! Oooh, prelude to a kiss. Their second kiss. Excellent. She\u0027d been ready to make a move herself if he wasn\u0027t going to. \"I didn\u0027t expect that. I knew you\u0027d be pretty, but. ..\" He\u0027s really got to work on this romantic prince thing. Because he just sucks at it. Well, maybe princes don\u0027t have to try as hard. \"Thanks.\" \". . . but I didn\u0027t expect. . . the sheer excitement ... I think it\u0027s the force of your personality...\" \"David. Will you shut up and kiss me?\" \"... it\u0027s really extraordinary, you fairly vibrate with life ...\" \"David. Seriously.\" \". ..and—ack!\" He said \"ack\" because someone had grabbed him by the shirt collar and hauled him off the bed. A very large someone, even broader than David. In fact, it was— \"Ah-ha! Trying to get some nookie before the big day, eh?\" The king shook the prince like a terrier would shake a rat. \"Nice try.\" \"Al!\" she said furiously. \"Get lost! Go to bed!\" On top of being weird, they \u0027re all insomniacs... bizarre! \"Don\u0027t make me kick your big butt out of here.\" \"Save it, sweetie. And you ... time to go to your own room. I\u0027m a modern guy—\" \"A modern idiot is more like it,\" Sweetie snapped. \"—but I can\u0027t have premarital royal sex going on under my rooftop.\" \"It\u0027s none of your damned business if I want to have sex with a duck!\" she screeched. \"No,\" Prince David said, extricating himself from his father\u0027s grasp, \"but it\u0027s mine.\" He straightened his shirt and jerked his head, tossing his dark hair out of his face. \"Oh, and my lord king, if you ever yank me away from my fiancé again, I\u0027ll break out all your teeth.\" \"Whoa,\" the king and Christina said in unison. David treated them to a frigid bow. \"Good night.\" \"Did you hear that?\" the king cried as the door slammed. \"He threatened felony assault!\" \"He\u0027s not the only one.\" \"On his sovereign! Awww, they grow up so fast.\" He tapped his chest, which was currently covered with a T-shirt that read, I\u0027M THE KING, WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? \"Gets me right here.\" \"I\u0027m going to get you right there. Go away.\" \"Calm down—I\u0027m going, I\u0027m going.\" What a bunch of nutjobs, she thought, lying back down. I must be out of my mind. Sure you are. Then how come you can\u0027t wipe that silly grin off your face? Sleep was hard in coming; she spent entirely too much time thinking about the lean-in, and replaying the look in his eyes. For the first time, she didn\u0027t worry so much about what she was getting herself into. Chapter 11 \"Look, Eddie—\" \"Edmund.\" \"—don\u0027t take this the wrong way or anything—\" He sighed. \"I am bracing myself, because you always say that before coming out with something thoroughly offensive.\" \"Cracked my code, eh? Anyway, I\u0027m going to be the princess, right? So who cares what fork I use when? I mean, I\u0027ll be ...\" She snorted a giggle through her nose. He fervently hoped she would get over the habit of laughing like a loon whenever she contemplated her future station. \". . . royalty, and all.\" \"Exactly why you must set an example.\" \"Me?\" He noted she nearly fell out of her chair in surprise. \"Set an example?\" \"I admit,\" he said, admiring the way the sunlight bounced off her shoulder-length waves, making the blond strands look like beaten gold, \"it pains me to speak of it.\" It was fortunate she had excellent hair, because there was a truly unpleasant expression on her face at the moment. In fact, her dimples had entirely disappeared. They were, he privately drought, her best feature. They made her look mischievous and charming at the same time. \"Edmund, I\u0027ve got a real news flash for you. People don\u0027t give a crap what fork royalty uses.\" \"I beg to differ.\" \"Ed—they totally don\u0027t.\" They glared at each other and then Edmund, who had battled the king for years, switched tactics. \"Of course, if you want people to disparage His Highness because he chose a commoner who refused to rise above her station—\" \"Whoa, whoa. You\u0027re saying David will have to eat shit if I\u0027m not a good princess?\" \"In a word, yes.\" \"Well, son of a bitch!\" \"On the contrary, my mother was an extraordinarily patient and kind woman.\" \"Uh-huh.\" She grabbed a hank of hair and chewed on it. A loathsome habit he needed to break her of before she appeared in front of television cameras. \"Hey, Edmund, can I ask you something?\" \"You mean, something else?\" \"Yeah, yeah. How come you\u0027re doing this? Aren\u0027t there, like, a zillion underlings here in the palace who could be doing this? Tell me you wouldn\u0027t rather be just about anywhere else.\" She added in a mutter he heard perfectly well, \"God knows I would.\" \"I lost the coin toss,\" he said, striving for the right note of cool disdain. She really was quite something. He had seen instantly why the king had been charmed, and why David had dropped his I-don\u0027t-care-who-I-marry pose. She would be a splendid queen, if he could get her to lend an attentive ear. And naturally, such a vitally important job could not go to just anyone. He would oversee her education himself. Even if it killed him. \"Now. Again— oyster fork, soup spoon, marrow scoop, fish knife, entree knife, main course knife, salad knife—\" \"—fruit knife, dessert spoon, dessert fork, and a partridge in a pear tree!\" He stared at her, completely surprised. \"Oh. Oh! Well, that’s very good. Ah ... if you understood all along, then why... ?\" \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you ... I just can\u0027t resist yanking your chain.\" She tipped her chair back (French Louis XIV, circa 1860, listed for $972 Alaskan at Sotheby\u0027s) and grinned at him. \"What do you think of that, Eds?\" \"Edmund.\" \"Whatever. What\u0027s next on my agenda from hell?\" \"You have a history lesson in thirty minutes with our palace historian.\" The legs hit the carpet with a thump. \"History lessons?\" \"If you are to be a member of the royal family, it\u0027s important you know something of Alaskan history.\" \"Can\u0027t you just pick up that fruit fork and stick it in my eye instead?\" \"It would be improper before dessert is served, my lady. After history, you\u0027ll be meeting with Horrance, your wedding gown designer. We try to use local artisans whenever possible,\" he added, pretending she was remotely interested in an explanation, \"to aid the economy.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-8.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together? And will the palace still be standing when the dust clears?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:54 PM"}}
