Well, uh—\"\n \"Don\u0027t you start,\" she warned, shrugging into her coat. They stepped into the warm (for Alaska) spring day. \"Listen, do you not actually have a job anymore? Because you\u0027ve been here almost two weeks. Not that I don\u0027t love it, but I don\u0027t want you to get in trouble.\"\n \"I toldja. My boss thinks this is great P.R., so I\u0027m here as long as the king wants me to play bodyguard. Besides,\" he added, slinging an arm com-panionably around her shoulders, \"I\u0027da stayed anyway. I think you might be in over your head.\"\n \"Tell me. It\u0027s—\"\n Pop!\n \"Don,\" she said patiently, \"I\u0027ve asked you not to do that.\"\n \"Back off with the camera,\" Kurt ordered, his left hand disappearing into his jacket as, with his right hand, he blocked the lens. \"Right now.\"\n \"Whoa,\" she said, tugging on his arm until it came down. \"Don\u0027t go all Sean Penn on me. This is Don Cook—he\u0027s a local news guy. And, inconceivably, taking pictures of me helps him feed his family.\"\n \"Everybody\u0027s gotta make a living,\" Don said, firing off another picture. \"I couldn\u0027t help overhear-ing-\"\n \"Our completely private conversation.\"\n \"Does this mean the wedding\u0027s off?\"\n \"No,\" she said irritably. \"It means I haven\u0027t found a ring I like yet. Write this down in your lit-de book, Don-o—my promise to marry made me engaged, not a rock weighing down my finger.\"\n \"So it\u0027s still on?\"\n \"Three weeks to go,\" she said, and managed to conceal the shudder. Three weeks .. . and she still didn\u0027t know the prince much better than the day she\u0027d met him. Trouble was, she had a sneaking suspicion that was her fault more than his. \"And FYI, your invitation really did get lost in the mail.\"\n Don laughed. \"Sure. Later, Lady Christina.\"\n \"See you around, Don.\"\n Kurt was shaking his head as they walked toward the car. \"Lady... man, I still can\u0027t get used to that.\"\n \"Wait \u0027til they start with the princess stuff.\"\n \"You know, Chris, it\u0027s not too late. Say the word, and we\u0027re on a plane to L.A.\"\n \"Thanks, Kurt, I appreciate that, but it was my decision and I made it. And I\u0027m sticking with it.\"\n \"It\u0027s just.. . sometimes you don\u0027t seem like an excited bride-to-be.\"\n \"Don\u0027t let my moody, depressive, bitchy exterior fool you. Inside, I\u0027m crying with happiness.\"\n \"Ha!\"\n \"Things will settle down,\" she said doubtfully, \"after the wedding.\"\n \"Well. The offer still stands, you know.\"\n \"Is this \u0027get Chris off the hook\u0027 day? Did I miss a memo?\"\n \"I figure the doctor and me are just worried about you, is all.\"\n She studied him, her old friend, former lover, current cop and bodyguard. There had been a time when she would have stripped him of his sidearm and cheerfully shot him in the kneecap. Kurt was a California surfer-boy-turned-man to the nth degree; as far as she knew, he really was God\u0027s gift to women. Certainly he was one of the best-looking men she\u0027d ever run across in her many travels.\n And who knows what could have been, if he\u0027d been able to keep his hands to himself? Or at least, only on her?\n But she liked this better. It was so nice to have a friend nearby, one who knew her before she was (blare of trumpets, please) the Lady Christina. Although she knew intellectually that Kurt was yummier than a triple hot fudge sundae, she no longer felt it.\n Instead, whenever she thought yummy thoughts, images of David popped up in her head. It was annoying and distracting, especially since she had no idea how he truly felt about her, and was too embarrassed to ask.\n Dr. Pohl probably would have said it wasn\u0027t embarrassment, it was a poor sense of her own worth, and a fear of hearing an honest answer.\n But what did a board-certified shrink with four degrees know? So the woman made a lucky guess once in a while. Now she was Christina\u0027s personal oracle? Uh-uh.\n \"I just want you to know,\" Kurt was saying, \"that offer to take a plane to L.A. still stands, anytime. Day or night. You just say the word, we\u0027re out of here.\"\n \"Thanks.\" She squeezed his arm, then let go—it was his gun arm. \"You\u0027re the best.\"\n \"Yup. Keep it in mind,\" he added with a grin.\n Chapter 20\n Kurt walked her back to her room, dropped a brotherly kiss to her forehead, and disappeared for parts unknown after admonishing her to beep him when she wanted to go somewhere again. But the only place Chris wanted to go was bed ... she had a splitting headache and needed a nap. Possibly two. She hadn\u0027t... well, she hadn\u0027t been sleeping well lately.\n There was a black velvet ring box in the middle of her (made) bed.\n \"Dammit,\" she muttered. A) she\u0027d been after the chambermaids to leave her room alone, and B) another ring.\n She sighed and picked the box up. She ran through her litany of excuses: it\u0027s not me, it feels funny on my hand, I don\u0027t like the setting, I don\u0027t like the band, it\u0027s too expensive, it\u0027s—\n Oh.\n She\u0027d popped the lid open and stared hungrily at the ring. It was—it was just fine. In fact, it was beautiful. A largish, light blue stone, set in a simple silver setting. After months of turning down rings, she knew good cut and clarity when she saw it The blue stone—topaz? aquamarine?—was about two carats. A little larger than she would have liked, but not embarrassingly so.\n She slid it on her finger. It fit perfectly. The stone caught the natural light in her room and seemed to wink at her.\n Oh, it was ... it was just...\n Oh.\n Two hours later, she sagged to a stop outside Al\u0027s office, then rapped on the door. For a wonder, he was in—usually he had snuck off to fish by this time of the day.\n \"What\u0027s up?\" he asked, glumly signing paper after paper.\n \"You know what you need? You need a computer like on Star Trek. You know how the captain says, \u0027Computer, locate Commander Riker,\u0027 and the computer says, \u0027Commander Riker is boinking Troi in the holodeck,\u0027 or whatever? That\u0027s what this palace needs.\"\n \"Who can\u0027t you find?\"\n \"Who d\u0027you think? Your son! I\u0027ve looked everywhere and I\u0027m fucking exhausted!\"\n \"Not just run-of-the-mill exhausted?\" the king asked, grinning a little. \"Fucking exhausted?\"\n \"I\u0027m going to ignore that with the dignity it doesn\u0027t deserve. He\u0027s not in the penguin room, he\u0027s not in the gallery, the cooks told me he ate hours ago but he hasn\u0027t left the grounds, Edmund doesn\u0027t have a clue, Jenny just used the opportunity to bug me about shoe shopping, and Kurt doesn\u0027t know.\"\n \"He and his brothers and sisters are at the family plot,\" Al said. He capped his pen and ignored the overflowing in-bin. \"Today is the anniversary of their mother\u0027s death.\"\n \"Oh.\" Shit. \"Uh . . .\" Shit. \"Well. ..\"\n \"It\u0027s all right. We should have told you. But you\u0027d left to see Dr. Pohl and frankly, we didn\u0027t think hanging out at the family crypt was going to be your idea of a good time, so they went without you.\"\n \"Well. . . no . . . but...\" Incredibly, stupidly, she was hurt that the prince hadn\u0027t asked her to come. She was going to be his wife. This was her dead future mother-in-law, after all. And he\u0027d—they\u0027d— left her. Gone off and left her. \"Well. I\u0027m sorry to barge in and all. . .\"\n \"No prob, Chris. You\u0027re welcome in here anytime.\"\n \"Is there—how come you aren\u0027t there now?\"\n \"I went this morning,\" the king said quietly.\n \"Oh.\" She could feel her face getting red; this was turning into one of the most painfully embarrassing scenes she\u0027d ever been in the middle of. And she\u0027d been in the middle of plenty. \"Okay. Well.. . thanks for letting me know. Sorry to interrupt your work. What are you doing, anyway?\"\n \"Signing bills into laws. You know, regular paperwork.\"\n \"Sure. Regular paperwork. Okay. Well, see ya later.\"\n \"Stay out of trouble,\" he said absently, already back at work.\n \"Too late,\" she muttered, closing the door behind her. Where she promptly ran into Edmund. \"Geeyah! Must you sneak up on me like a goddamned ghoul all the time?\"\n \"Yes, my lady. A moment of your time?\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me the prince was hanging out by his mom\u0027s grave, fool?\"\n Edmund blinked in surprise. \"I didn\u0027t think he still was.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Hmm. Well, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be back soon.\"\n \"Well, good. I need to talk to him. Check this out!\" She proudly flashed her ring. \"Isn\u0027t it great?\"\n \"Praise the Lord—the lady has made a selection.\"\n \"I\u0027ve told you a zillion times, stop talking about me in the third person. What do you want, anyway?\"\n \"I\u0027d like you to come along with me and approve your apartments.\"\n \"My what?\" She fell into step beside him, which wasn\u0027t easy because he had a stride like an ostrich.\n \"Where you and His Highness will live after the wedding.\"\n \"Oh. We\u0027re living here? Is that what David wants?\"\n \"I would imagine so, my lady, as he\u0027s the one who gave the orders for these apartments to be finished well before your wedding day.\"\n \"Thanks for asking, Dave,\" she mumbled.\n \"Beg pardon, my lady?\"\n \"Nothing. So, we\u0027re gonna live here? All the time? Not that I mind, because this is a really nice place, and it\u0027s plenty big enough for all of us, but...\"\n \"The prince also has homes in Boston, London, Prince Edward Island, and Rome.\"\n \"Coastal towns,\" she said.\n \"Well. His Highness is a marine biologist.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-20.html","bookId":2789,"book":{"id":2789,"title":"The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Royal Treatment (Alaskan Royal Family #1) \n In this delightful and dazzling erotic novel, MaryJanice Davidson creates an alternate contemporary world nearly identical to ours in which Russia never sold the Alaskan territory to the United States. Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he\u0027d settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina\u0027s no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he\u0027s Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together? And will the palace still be standing when the dust clears?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:54 PM"}}
