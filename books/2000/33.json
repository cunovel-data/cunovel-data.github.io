{"id":98270,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"She’s been out all day. I’m starting to think she might be avoiding me.\\n\\n Honestly, I don’t know what to think.\\n\\n And thinking is all I’ve done, and it’s messing with my head.\\n\\n I hate not knowing where I stand with her. Are we back to being just friends? Have I fucked it up completely with her? Has she changed her mind about me … us?\\n\\n I can’t just come out and ask her. I’m worried if I do, I’ll hear something I don’t want to.\\n\\n I stand up, feeling irritated and frustrated, and angry with myself. It’s a fucking hot day, and it hasn’t cooled with the sun going down.\\n\\n Dozer lifts his head and gives a sad sigh. He’s missing her too.\\n\\n Fuck this. I need to cool off.\\n\\n I strip my tank and shorts off, leaving just my boxer shorts on. I run toward the lake, down the boardwalk, and dive straight in.\\n\\n The cold waters hits me, making me feel instantly clearer. I swim under the water until my lungs start to burn, forcing me to resurface. I scrub my hands over my face, drying off the water, and push my hair back. Blinking the water off my lashes, I tip my head back and float in the water as I stare up at the sky.\\n\\n I’ve no idea how long I stay there like that, but when I decide to swim back, I push my legs down and lift my head to see Mia standing at the edge of the boardwalk watching me.\\n\\n She looks like an angel silhouetted by the glow of the early evening sky.\\n\\n Taking a deep breath, I swim to her, reaching a few feet from the boardwalk when I’m stopped in my tracks.\\n\\n Fingers gripping the hem of her shirt, she pulls it over her head, dropping it to the floor.\\n\\n The air is knocked out of me, and I can only stare at the gorgeous sight of her. Denim shorts and a white lace bra make for a sexy image.\\n\\n She looks like a fucking angel. A sexy fucking angel.\\n\\n Then she unbuttons her shorts and slides them down her legs, stepping out.\\n\\n She’s wearing matching lace panties.\\n\\n Thank you god.\\n\\n I’m transfixed. I have never seen anything as beautiful as her.\\n\\n Sitting on the edge of the boardwalk, she swings her legs in the water. Hands on the sides, she slides down, submerging herself.\\n\\n She swims close to me. “Hi,” she says quietly.\\n\\n “Hi.”\\n\\n “I’m sorry I haven’t been around. I just—”\\n\\n I shake my head. “Mia, you don’t have to explain anything—”\\n\\n “Yes, I do. And I will. But not right now. Right now, all I want is for you to kiss me … and make love to me.”\\n\\n Fuck. Me.\\n\\n I suck in a breath.\\n\\n I want her. Really want her.\\n\\n Half an hour ago, I would have sold my Mustang if it meant I could be with her.\\n\\n But now … I don’t know what this means. She’s been gone all day, and now she turns up, strips off her clothes, and tells me she wants me to make love to her.\\n\\n My cock is telling my brain to shut the fuck up, and just do it, but my head is worried if I do, I’ll only end up pushing her further away.\\n\\n “I need you, Jordan … please,” she whispers.\\n\\n Hearing her plead like that … I’m done for. Add in the fact that I haven’t had sex for weeks, and she is the most beautiful woman I’ve had the privilege to know, and my willpower is shot to fucking hell.\\n\\n My hand goes to the back of her head and I bring my mouth crashing down to hers.\\n\\n She moans, her arms instantly going around my neck, her legs wrapping around my waist.\\n\\n Jesus fucking Christ.\\n\\n I wrap both my arms around her tiny waist, kissing her like there’s no breath left in my body. Like she’s my lifeline. With our mouths melded together, I lick the inside of her mouth. She tastes like a mixture of candy and mouthwash.\\n\\n Her hands slide down my arms, into the water and then across my back. Her fingers creep into the elastic of my boxers.\\n\\n “I want you,” she breathes into my mouth.\\n\\n Then my goddamn brain has to kick back in. I really fucking hate my brain at times.\\n\\n “Wait.” I pull back, breathing hard.\\n\\n The disappointment shows clear in her eyes. I take her face in my hands.\\n\\n “We don’t have to do this now. I’ll wait, however long you need. I just want to be with you. That’s all that matters. Sex can come later.”\\n\\n Her grip on my boxer shorts increases, and I can feel her nails digging in my skin. “I don’t want to wait. I want you now. I want to feel normal and complete and whole, and I feel all those things when I’m with you.”\\n\\n My heart sinks.\\n\\n I shake my head, solemn. “Babe, having sex with me isn’t going to change how you feel about yourself. Those things will still be there afterwards.”\\n\\n Who the fuck am I nowadays? Dr. Fucking Phil?\\n\\n “But they’ll be gone for a time.”\\n\\n I shake my head again because I don’t know what else to do. To be honest, I’m feeling pretty fucking gutted right now.\\n\\n Her gaze lowers. “You don’t want me,” she whispers, starting to pull away.\\n\\n The tone in her voice almost kills me.\\n\\n Keeping hold, I force her eyes to mine. “I want you, babe. Believe me, I want you like I’ve never wanted anything before in my life. I can think of nothing else but you. What it would feel like to be inside you. I want you because I’m gone for you.” I let out a light sigh, my gaze dipping. “But I want you to have sex with me because you want it for the same reasons as I do – and no other reason.”\\n\\n She leans in and sucks my bottom lip into her mouth. “I want you because, since the day I met you, I’ve thought of nothing else but what it would feel like to have you inside me.”\\n\\n And just like that, my brain is gone.\\n\\n I kiss her with everything I have. I kiss her like I don’t know how long I have left with her. And maybe that’s because I don’t.\\n\\n She rubs herself up against my aching cock, and the need to be inside her becomes urgent.\\n\\n “Fuck, Mia,” I groan.\\n\\n Keeping hold of her, I wade through the water and walk up the bank, not wanting to let go of her for one second, with only one destination is in mind – my bed.\\n\\n Mia’s hands are gripping my shoulders, nails digging in my damp skin. Her wet tits are pressed up against my chest, begging for me to touch them.\\n\\n Sliding the palm of my hand over the lace of her bra, I rub her already hard nipple through it. Then I move my hand up, around the nape of her neck, driving my fingers into her hair, I take her mouth again in a deep, hard kiss.\\n\\n She moans a sound so fucking erotic that I almost lose my shit right here.\\n\\n When I finally reach my room, I kick the door shut, then lay her down on my bed.\\n\\n My room is in darkness, the only light coming in through the window. I really want to see her, so I reach for the lamp, but she stops me.\\n\\n “Leave it off.”\\n\\n What? Why?\\n\\n I want to see every gorgeous inch of her, but because it’s her, and I know she’ll have her reasons, I let it go and slowly retract my hand.\\n\\n We can forego the light, but after tonight, I’m going to have every light in this goddamn room on so that I can see every beautiful inch of her.\\n\\n I stare down at her, letting my eyes adjust to the dark. I see the creamy skinned silhouette of Mia on my bed, and it turns me on in a way I didn’t know possible.\\n\\n I’ve never had a woman in my bed before. This has always been my space, but I want to share my space with her. I want her here. I want her in every aspect of my life.\\n\\n Climbing up on the bed, I kneel between her parted legs.\\n\\n I lean over her, hands pressing into the mattress either side of her head. I dip my mouth down and kiss her once.\\n\\n Then I trail my hand with featherlight movements down her face, going down her neck until I reach the peak of breasts where her still damp skin awaits me.\\n\\n “Is this okay?” I check before diving in.\\n\\n “Yes.” She sounds breathy and sexy. So damn hot.\\n\\n Lifting her hand to my head, she slides her fingers into my damp hair.\\n\\n I free one strap off her shoulder, letting it fall as I move the cup, freeing her breast.\\n\\n Her nipple is taut, and so very ready for me.\\n\\n I dip my head and take her into my mouth, sucking hard. She groans, her hips jerking upward, pressing her pussy hard against my cock. I nearly shoot my load.\\n\\n “Fuck,” I groan. I grip her hip with my hand, keeping her steady. I intend on making this last for as long as possible.\\n\\n I return my attention to her nipple, laving it with my tongue, then I begin licking and sucking every part of her tit. Not content with the limited access, I ease my hand behind her, reaching for the clasp on her bra. She inclines, allowing me to unhook it, and I slide it down her arms, tossing it to the floor.\\n\\n She lays back, hands on my shoulders.\\n\\n I stare down at her naked tits, unable to look away. “Fuck … Mia, you’re beautiful.”\\n\\n Her hand goes to her face, covering it. I know she’s feeling shy.\\n\\n I move her hand from her face. “You’re beautiful,” I reaffirm and press a gentle kiss to her lips.\\n\\n I shift down her body, allowing me access to her neglected tit. I take it in my mouth, paying it the same attention, sucking and licking while I pinch her other nipple with my thumb and finger.\\n\\n She cries out. Pushing against me, panting, “Jordan, please. I need you.”\\n\\n “Fuck. You’re so fucking hot.” I drop my head against her chest. “I wanted this to last, but I don’t know if I can.”\\n\\n Getting to my knees, I hook my fingers into the top of her damp panties. I pause, giving her time to let me know if this is too much.\\n\\n She nods her head, lightly. “Please,” she says.\\n\\n I pull her panties down her legs. She bends her leg, allowing me to slip it off one leg, then the other. I toss them to the floor and look down at her pussy. It’s shaved and neat. I bet she tastes as sweet as she smells.\\n\\n My cock hardens further. I grab it through my wet boxers, sliding the shaft up and down, all the while staring at her pussy.\\n\\n “I need to taste you.” I’m asking, but I don’t wait for her answer because I’m off the end of the bed, knees on the floor, spreading her thighs.\\n\\n I press my mouth to her pussy, sucking on her clit. Jesus, she tastes amazing.\\n\\n She cries out, making a mewling sound, digging her heels into the bed. I smile, loving her reaction as I run my nose between her lips, inhaling her.\\n\\n “So fuckin’ good,” I murmur, knowing the vibration of my voice will only tease her further.\\n\\n “Please, Jordan…” she moans. “I need…”\\n\\n I run my tongue down, pushing it inside her, taking more of her sweetness into my mouth. “Shh … it’s okay. I got you, babe.” I press my tongue against her clit and slide a finger inside her. Then another.\\n\\n Then I’m pumping my fingers in and out, licking and sucking her. And I don’t stop going until she’s exploding under my mouth.\\n\\n While she’s coming down from her orgasm, I remove my boxer shorts in the fastest time known to man, and climb up her panting, trembling body, so ready to be inside her it’s not even funny.\\n\\n I kiss her, running my tongue over her lips, letting her taste herself on me.\\n\\n She sucks my tongue into her mouth. Her fingers dig into my hips, pulling me closer. “I want you,” she breathes.\\n\\n Jesus. She’s so fucking sexy. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trouble/page-33.html","bookId":2000,"book":{"id":2000,"title":"Trouble","description":"Storyline: Mia Monroe is running.
