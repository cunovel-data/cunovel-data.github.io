{"id":14956,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 20: The Escape.","content":"Soon after eight o\u0027clock customers began to drop in, and throughout the day a brisk trade was carried on. Surajah was sent for, in the course of the morning, by the governor; who bought several silver bracelets, brooches, and earrings for his wife. Most of the other officers came in during the day, and made similar purchases, and many trinkets were also sold to the soldiers, who considered them a good investment for their money. Indeed, no small portion of the earnings of the natives of India are spent upon silver ornaments for their women, as they can at any time be converted into cash. The commoner cloths, knives, beads, and trinkets were almost all disposed of, by the end of the day, for as no traders had come up for six months, and as a long time might elapse before others did so, the garrison were glad to lay in a store of useful articles for themselves and families, especially as the prices of all the goods were at least as low as they could have been bought in a town. \"We sha\u0027n\u0027t leave much behind us,\" Dick said, as he looked round after the last customer had left, and they had sat down to their evening meal. \"Almost all the silver work and the better class of goods have gone, and I should say three-quarters of the rest. I daresay we shall get rid of the remainder tomorrow. I don\u0027t suppose many of the soldiers stationed down by the gate have come up yet; but when they hear that we sell cheaply, some of them will be here tomorrow. We have made no money by the transaction, but at any rate we shall have got back the outlay. Of course, I should not have cared if we had got nothing back. Still, it is satisfactory to have cleared oneself. \"I wonder how Ibrahim is getting on, down in the wood.\" \"He won\u0027t be expecting us today,\" Surajah replied, \"but I have no doubt he will begin to feel anxious by tomorrow night. I wish we could have seen some way of getting the horses down. It will be awkward doing without them.\" \"Yes. I hope we shall get a good start. Of course, we must put on our peasant\u0027s dresses again. I am glad enough to be rid of that rope, though I have had to put on two or three additional things, to fill me out to the same size as before. Still, I don\u0027t feel so bound in as I did, though it is horribly hot.\" \"I am sure I shall be glad to get rid of all this stuffing,\" Surajah said. \"I felt ready to faint today, when the room was full.\" \"Well, we have only one more day of it,\" Dick said. \"I do hope Father will be able to get out by ten o\u0027clock. Then, before eleven we shall be at the edge of the rock. Say we are two hours in getting down, and walking round to join Ibrahim. That will take us till one, and we shall have a good five hours before Father\u0027s escape will be discovered. They will know that he can\u0027t have gone down the road, and it will take them fully two hours to search the fort, and all over the rock. It will be eight o\u0027clock before they set out in pursuit, and by that time we ought to be well on the road between Cenopatam and Anicull. \"If we can manage to buy horses at Cenopatam, of course we will do so. We shall be there by five o\u0027clock, and ought to be able to get them in a couple of hours. Once on horseback, we are safe. I don\u0027t think they will pursue very far--perhaps not even so far as Cenopatam; for the governor will see that he had better not make any fuss about a white captive having escaped, when it was not known that he had one there at all. I think it more likely that, when he finds Father has got fairly away, he will take no steps at all. They have no cavalry here, and he will know, well enough, that there will be no chance of our being tracked and overtaken by footmen, if we had but a couple of hours\u0027 start.\" \"I think that is so, Dick. He has done his duty in keeping your father a prisoner, but I don\u0027t think he will be, at heart, at all sorry that he has made his escape.\" \"I think, Surajah, I will write a letter to him, and leave it here, to be found after we have got away, thanking him in Father\u0027s name for the kindness that he has always shown him, saying who I am, why I came here, and asking his pardon for the deception that I have been obliged to play upon him. He is a good old fellow, and I should think it would please him.\" \"I should think it would,\" Surajah agreed. \"I will do up my brace of pistols in a packet, and put them with the note,\" Dick went on, \"and will say, in it, that I hope he will accept them as a token of our esteem and gratitude. They are well-finished English pistols, and I have no doubt he will prize them. I will mention, too, that we shall have made our escape at eleven o\u0027clock, and therefore, by the time he receives my letter, we shall be far beyond the reach of pursuit. I daresay that will decide him upon letting the matter pass quietly, and he will see himself that, by making no fuss over it, no one outside the fortress will ever know that a prisoner has escaped.\" The next day passed comparatively quietly. A good many soldiers and women came up from below, and before sunset their goods were completely cleared out. The governor came over in the afternoon and had a talk with them. They expressed their satisfaction at the result of their trading, and said that they should be off before sunrise. \"I hope you will come again,\" he said; \"but not for another six months, for assuredly you will take away with you pretty nearly every rupee in the fortress. My wife and the other ladies are all well content with their purchases, and agree that they would not have got them cheaper at Seringapatam, or Bangalore.\" \"We try to buy cheaply and sell cheaply,\" Surajah said modestly. \"In that way we turn over our money quickly. But it is seldom, indeed, that we find so good a market as we have done here. When we left Bangalore, we thought that it might be a month before we should have to go back there to replenish our packs from our magazine; but we shall only have been away five or six days.\" \"I am glad that you are content, for you are honest traders, and not like some of the rascals that have come up to the forts I have commanded, and fleeced the soldiers right and left.\" Although not given to blushing, Dick felt that he coloured under his dye at the praise; for although they had certainly sold cheaply, he doubted whether the term honest could be fairly applied to the whole transaction. As ten o\u0027clock approached, the two friends sat with open door, listening intently for every sound. Conversation was still going on in the houses, and occasionally they could make out a dark figure crossing the yard. It was not yet ten when a light footfall was heard, and a moment later Captain Holland appeared at the door. \"It is all right so far,\" he said, \"but wait five minutes, to give me time to get the ladder fixed. You had better come one by one, and stroll quietly across the yard. It is too dark for anyone to recognise you, unless they run right against you; and even if they do so, they will not think it strange you should be out, after having been cooped up all the day.\" In another moment he was gone. They had each, during the day, gone out for a time, and had walked round through the narrow lane behind the governor\u0027s house, to see that there were no obstructions that they might fall over in the dark. They agreed, on comparing notes, that Captain Holland had chosen the best possible place for scaling the wall, for the lane was evidently quite unused, and the house, which was higher than the wall, would completely screen them from observation. In five minutes Dick followed his father, leaving Surajah to come on in a minute or two. They had secured about them the gold and silver they had received for their purchases, but they left behind a large heap of copper coins, on the top of which Dick had placed his letter to the governor, and the parcel containing the brace of pistols. He met no one on his way to the rendezvous, but almost ran against his father in the dark. \"Steady, Dick, or you will run me down,\" Captain Holland said. \"I have got the ladder fixed, so you had better go up at once. Take these three spears with you. I will bring the long ladder.\" \"We sha\u0027n\u0027t want the spears, Father. We have a brace of double-barrelled pistols, and two brace of single barrels.\" \"Never mind that, Dick. You will see that they will come in useful.\" Dick took the spears, and mounted the ladder without further question. His father then came up and placed the long rope, which, with the pieces of wood, was a bulky bundle, on the wall and then descended again. It was another five minutes before Surajah came up. \"I was stopped on the way,\" he said, \"and had to talk with one of the officers.\" He and the captain were soon by Dick\u0027s side. The ladder was then pulled up, and lowered on the other side of the wall. They were soon standing at its foot. \"Shall I jerk the ladder down, Father?\" \"I think not, Dick. It would only make a clatter, and it is no matter to us whether they find it in the morning or not. You had better follow me. I know every foot of the ground, and there are some nasty places, I can tell you.\" They had to make several detours, to avoid ravines running deep into the plateau, and for a time Captain Holland walked very cautiously. When he had passed these, he stepped out briskly, and in less than an hour from starting they were near the edge of the precipice. Their eyes had, by this time, become accustomed to the darkness. \"We are just there now,\" Captain Holland said. \"But we must go very cautiously, for the rock falls sheer away, without warning. Ah! There is the edge, a few yards ahead of me. \"Now, do you stay where you are, while I feel about for that spear head I put in to mark the place. It had about three feet of the staff on it. If it were not for that, there would be small chance of finding it. I know it is somewhere close here.\" In a few minutes he returned to them. \"I have found it,\" he said. \"Keep close behind me.\" After walking for fifty yards, he stopped. \"Here it is, lads. \"Now give me those spears, Dick.\" He thrust them firmly into the ground, a few inches apart. \"Throw your weight on them, too,\" he said. \"That is right. Now they will stand many times the strain we shall put on them. \"I have chosen this place, Dick, for two reasons. In the first place, because it is the most perpendicular, and in the second, because the soil and grass project slightly over the edge of the rock. There is a cushion in that bundle, and four spear heads. I will peg it down close to the edge, and the rope will run easily over it. \"Now, Surajah, we had better let you down first. You will be tied quite securely, and there will be no risk whatever, as you know, of the rope giving way. I should advise you to keep your eyes shut, till you get to the bottom, for the rope will certainly twist round and round; but keep your arms well in front of you, and whenever you feel the rock, open your eyes, and send yourself off with your arms and legs. I don\u0027t think you will touch, for at this point it seemed to me, as I looked down, that the rock projects farther out than anywhere else on the face of the precipice, and that a stone dropped straight down would fall some fourteen or fifteen feet from its foot. Would you like me to bandage your eyes?\" \"No, thank you. I will keep my eyes closed.\" \"That is the best thing you can do,\" Captain Holland said, \"though it is so dark that you would not be able to see, if you did. When you get to the bottom, untie the rope, pull it gently down, and call out to me whether the lowest piece of stick touches the ground. If it does not, I will pull it up again and fasten on some more. I have got a dozen spare ones with me.\" Captain Holland then told Surajah and Dick to take off their upper garments. These he wound round and round the lower four feet of the rope, increasing its diameter to over two inches. \"There,\" he said, as he fastened this round Surajah\u0027s body, under the arms. \"It won\u0027t hurt you, now. That silk rope would have cut in an inch deep before you got to the bottom, if it had not been covered.\" Then he took off his own garment, made it up into a roll, lashed one end to the rope in the centre of Surajah\u0027s back, passed it between his legs and fastened it to the knot at his chest. \"There,\" he said; \"that will prevent any possibility of the thing slipping up over your shoulders, and will take a lot of the strain off your chest.\" Then he lay down and crawled forward to the edge, pegged the cushion down, and then, turning to Surajah, said: \"All is ready now.\" Surajah had felt rather ashamed that all these precautions should be taken for him, while the others would have to rely solely upon their hands and feet, and, sternly repressing any sign of nervousness, he stepped forward to the side of Captain Holland. \"That is right,\" the captain said approvingly. \"Now, lie down by my side, and work yourself backwards. Go over on one side of the cushion, for you might otherwise displace it. I will hold your wrists and let you over. Dick will hold the rope. I will put it fairly on the cushion. Then I shall take it and stand close to the edge, and pay it out gradually as you go down. If you should find any projecting piece of rock, call out \u0027Stop!\u0027 I will hold on at once. We can then talk over how we can best avoid the difficulty. When you are down, and I tell you Dick is coming, take hold of one of the steps, and hold the ladder as firmly as you can, so as to prevent it from swaying about. \"Now, are you ready?\" \"Quite ready,\" Surajah said, in a firm voice. Dick, who was standing five or six yards back, tightened the rope. Gradually he saw Surajah\u0027s figure disappear over the edge. \"Slack out a little bit,\" his father said. \"That is right. I have got it over the cushion. Now hold it firmly until I am on my feet. That is right. Now pay it out gradually.\" It seemed an endless time, to Dick, before his father exclaimed: \"The strain is off! Thank God, he has got down all right!\" A minute later there was a slight pull on the rope, and the captain paid it out until he heard a call from below. \"Have you got to the lowest stick?\" he asked, leaning over. \"Yes; it is just touching the ground.\" \"Not such a bad guess,\" the captain said, as he turned to Dick. \"There are about twenty feet left.\" He now fastened the rope round the spears in the ground. \"I will lower you down, if you like, Dick. You are half as heavy again as that young native, but I have no doubt that I can manage it.\" \"Not at all, Father. I am not a bit nervous about it. If it was light, I should not feel so sure of myself, for I might turn giddy; but there is no fear of my doing so now.\" \"Well, lad, it is as well to be on the safe side, and I manufactured this yesterday.\" He put a loop, composed of a rope some four feet long, over Dick\u0027s shoulders and under his arms. To each end was attached a strong double hook, like two fingers. \"There, lad! Now, if you feel at all tired or shaky, all you have got to do is to hook this on to one of the steps. Do you see? One hook on each side of the cord. That way you can rest as long as you like, and then go on again. You say you can go down a rope with your hands only. I should advise you to do that, if you can, and not to use your legs unless you want to sit down on one of the long steps; for, as you know, if you use your feet the rope will go in till they are almost level with your head; while, if you use your arms only, it will hang straight down.\" \"I know, Father. And I don\u0027t suppose I shall have to rest at all, for these cross sticks make it ten times as easy as having to grip the rope only.\" Dick and his friends escape from the hill fortress Dick laid himself down as Surajah had done, and crawled backwards until he was lying half over the edge. Then he seized the rope and began to descend, hand over hand. He counted the rungs as he went down, and half way he sat down on one of the long pieces, hitched the hooks on to the one above, and rested his arms. After a short pause, he continued until he reached the bottom. The captain, who was stooping with his hand on the rope, felt the vibration cease, and as he leaned over he heard Dick call out: \"I am all right, Father. Those bits of wood make easy work of it.\" Then the captain at once began to descend, and was soon standing beside his son and Surajah. \"Thank God that job is finished! How do you both feel?\" \"My arms feel as if they had done some work, Father. I have been four or five months without practice, or I should hardly have felt it.\" \"And how are you, Surajah?\" \"I feel ashamed at having been let down like a baby, Captain Holland, and at being so nervous.\" \"There is nothing to be ashamed of,\" Captain Holland said. \"Rope climbing is a thing that only comes with practice; and as to nervousness, most landsmen are afraid to trust themselves to a rope at all. Did you open your eyes?\" \"Not once, Sahib. I kept my arms out, as you told me, but I did not touch anything. I could feel that I was spinning round and round, and was horribly frightened just at first. But I went down so smoothly and quietly that the feeling did not last long; for I knew that the rope was very strong, and as I did not touch anything, it seemed to me that there could be no fear of it being cut against the rock.\" The clothes were soon unwound from the rope, and put on again. Captain Holland cut off all the slack of the rope, and made it into a coil. \"The slope is all right, as far as I could see from the top,\" he said; \"but we may come across nasty bits again, and this will stand in useful, if we do.\" They went down cautiously, but at a fair rate of speed; until, without meeting with any serious difficulty, they arrived on the plain. Four miles\u0027 brisk walking brought them to the grove where Ibrahim had been left, and they had scarce entered among the trees when he asked: \"Who is it that is coming?\" \"It is us, Ibrahim. We have got my father!\" Ibrahim gave an exclamation of joy, and a minute later they joined him. \"You were not asleep, then, Ibrahim?\" Dick said. \"No, my lord. I have slept during the day, and watched at night; but I did not sleep yesterday, for I was growing sorely anxious, and had begun to fear that harm had befallen you.\" \"Well, let us be off at once. Of course, we have had to leave the horses behind us, and I want to be at Cenopatam by daybreak. We will buy horses there.\" They struck across the country to the southwest, until they came on a road between Magree and Cenopatam, and arrived within sight of the latter town just at daybreak. As they walked, Dick and Surajah had, with no small amount of pain, removed their beards and the patches of hair. \"You ought both to have shaved before you put those things on,\" Captain Holland said, as they muttered exclamations of pain. \"You see, cobbler\u0027s wax, or whatever it is, sticks to what little down there is on your cheeks and chin, and I don\u0027t wonder that it hurts horribly, pulling it off. If you had shaved first, you would not have felt any of that.\" \"I will remember that, Father, if I ever have to disguise myself again,\" Dick said. \"I feel as if I were pulling the whole skin off my face.\" The painful task was at last finished. \"I shall be glad to have a look at you in the morning, Dick,\" his father said, \"so as to see what you are really like; of which I have not the least idea, at present. You must feel a deal more comfortable, now that you have got rid of the rope.\" \"I am, indeed. I am sure Surajah must be quite as much pleased at leaving his padding behind.\" They stopped half a mile from the town, which was a place of considerable size. Dick took, from the saddlebag of the horse Ibrahim was leading, the bottle of liquid with which he was in the habit of renewing his staining every few days, and darkened his father\u0027s face and hands. Then they took off their costumes as merchants, and put on their peasants\u0027 attire. Dick directed Ibrahim to make a detour, so as to avoid the town and come down on the road half a mile beyond it, and there wait until they rejoined them--for his father was to accompany Ibrahim. It was growing light as Dick and Surajah entered the town, and in half an hour the streets became alive with people. After some search, they found a man who had several horses to sell, and, after the proper amount of bargaining, they purchased three fairly good animals. Another half hour was occupied in procuring saddles and bridles, and, after riding through quiet streets to avoid questioning, they left the town, and soon rejoined their companions. \"Now, Surajah,\" Dick said, \"we will be colonels again for a bit.\" The saddlebags were again opened, and in a few minutes they were transformed. \"Why, where on earth did you get those uniforms?\" Captain Holland asked, in surprise. \"Those sashes are the signs that their wearers are officers of the Palace, for I have seen them more than once at Kistnagherry; and the badges are those of colonels. There is nothing like impudence, Dick, but it seems to me it would have been safer if you had been contented with sub-officers\u0027 uniforms.\" Dick laughed. \"We are wearing them because we have a right to them,\" Dick laughed. \"We are both colonels in Tippoo\u0027s army, and officers of the Palace--that is, we were so until a month ago, though I expect since then our names have been struck off their army list. I will tell you about it, as we ride.\" \"You had better tell me afterwards, Dick. I have never ridden a horse in my life, except when they were taking me from the coast to Mysore, and I shall have enough to do to keep my seat and attend to my steering, without trying to listen to you.\" They rode all day, passed through Anicull and Oussoor, and halted for the night in a grove two or three miles farther on. They had not been questioned as, at a walk, they went through the town. Captain Holland had ridden behind with Ibrahim, and the latter had stopped and laid in a stock of provisions at Anicull. \"Thank goodness that is over!\" Captain Holland said, as they dismounted. \"I feel as if I had been beaten all over with sticks, and am as hungry as a hunter.\" \"Ibrahim will have some food ready in half an hour, Father, and I shall be glad of some myself. Though, you know, we all had some chupatties he bought.\" \"They were better than nothing, Dick, but a pancake or two does not go very far, with men who have been travelling since ten o\u0027clock last night. Well, lad, I am glad that you have got rid of your beard, and that, except for that brown skin, I am able to have a look at you as you are. You will be bigger than I am, Dick--bigger by a good bit, I should say, and any father might be proud of you, much more so one who has been fetched out from a captivity from which he had given up all hope of escaping. As it is, lad, words can\u0027t tell how grateful I feel, to God, for giving me such a son.\" \"My dear Father, it is Mother\u0027s doing. It has been her plan, ever since she heard that you were wrecked, that we should come out here to find you, and she has had me regularly trained for it. I had masters for fencing and gymnastics, we always talked Hindustani when we were together, and she has encouraged me to fight with other boys, so that I should get strong and quick.\" That evening by the fire, Dick told his father the whole story of his life since he had been in India. \"Well, my lad, you have done wonders,\" his father said, when he had finished; \"and if I had as much enterprise and go as you have, I should have been out of this place years ago. But in the first place, I was very slow in picking up their lingo. You see, until within the last three or four years, there have always been other Englishmen with me. Of course we talked together, and as most of them were able to speak a little of the lingo, there was no occasion for me to learn it. Then I was always, from the first, when they saw that I was handy at all sorts of things, kept at odd jobs, and so got less chance of picking up the language than those who were employed in drilling, or who had nothing to do but talk to their guards. But most of all, I did not try to escape because I found that, if I did so, it would certainly cost my companions their lives. That was the way that scoundrel Tippoo kept us from making attempts to get off. \"Well, soon after the last of the other captives was murdered, we moved away to Kistnagherry, which was a very difficult place to escape from; and besides, very soon after we got there, I heard of the war with our people, and hoped that they would take the place. It was, as you may suppose, a terrible disappointment to me when they failed in their attack on it. Still, I hoped that they would finally thrash Tippoo, and that, somehow, I might get handed over to them. However, as you know, when peace was made, and Kistnagherry had to be given over, the governor got orders to evacuate it, without waiting for the English to come up to take possession. \"Well, since I have been at Savandroog, I have thought often of trying to get away. By the time I got there, I had learned to speak the language fairly enough to make my way across the country, and I have been living in hopes that, somehow or other, I might get possession of a rope long enough to let myself down the rocks. But, as I told you, I have never so much as seen one up there twenty feet long. \"I did think of gradually buying enough cotton cloth to twist up and make a rope of; but you see, when one has been years in captivity, one loses a lot of one\u0027s energy. If I had been worse off, I should have set about the thing in earnest; but you see, I was not badly treated at all. I was always doing odd carpentering jobs for the colonel and officers, and armourer\u0027s work at the guns. Any odd time I had over, I did jobs for the soldiers and their wives. I got a good many little presents, enough to keep me in decent clothes and decent food--if you can call the food you have up there decent--and to provide me with tobacco; so that, except that I was a prisoner, and for the thought of my wife and you, I had really nothing to grumble about, and was indeed better off than anyone in the fortress, except the officers. So you see, I just existed, always making up my mind that some day I should see a good chance of making my escape, but not really making any preparations towards casting off my moorings. \"Now, Dick, it must be past twelve o\u0027clock, and I am dog tired. How far have we to ride tomorrow?\" \"It is thirty-five miles from Oussoor to Kistnagherry, which will be far enough for us to go tomorrow, and then another five-and-twenty will take us down to Tripataly. As the horses have gone about forty miles, it would be a long journey for them to go right through tomorrow.\" \"I don\u0027t think I could do it, Dick, if they could. I expect I shall be stiffer tomorrow than I am now. Eager as I am to see your dear mother, I don\u0027t want to have to be lifted off my horse when I arrive there, almost speechless with fatigue.\" The next day they rode on to Kistnagherry, passing a small frontier fort without question. They slept at the post house there, Dick and Surajah having removed their scarves and emblems of rank, as soon as they passed the frontier, in order to escape all inquiries. They started next morning at daybreak, and arrived within sight of Tripataly at ten o\u0027clock. \"Now, Father, I will gallop on,\" Dick said. \"I must break the news to Mother, before you arrive.\" \"Certainly, Dick,\" his father, who had scarcely spoken since they started, replied. \"I have been feeling very anxious about it, all the morning; for though, as you tell me, she has never lost faith in my being alive, my return cannot but be a great shock to her.\" Dick rode on, and on arriving at the palace was met in the courtyard by the Rajah, who was on the point of going out on horseback. He dismounted at once. \"I am truly glad to see you back, Dick, for your mother has been in a sad state of anxiety about you. Eight days ago, she started up from a nap she was taking, in the middle of the day, and burst out crying, saying that she was certain you were in some terrible danger, though whether you were killed or not she could not say. Since then she has been in a bad state. She has scarcely closed an eye, and has spent her whole time in walking restlessly up and down.\" \"It is quite true that I was in great danger, Uncle, and I am sorry indeed that she is in this state, for my coming home will be a shock to her; and she has an even greater one to bear. Surajah and I have rescued my father, and he will be here in a few minutes.\" \"I congratulate you,\" the Rajah said warmly. \"That is news, indeed--news that I, for one, never expected to hear. It is simply marvellous, Dick. However, I am sure that your mother is not fit to bear it, at present. I will go up now, and tell Gholla to break your return gradually to her. I will say nothing about your father to your aunt. As soon as the news that you are here is broken, you must go to your mother. Tell her as little as possible. Pretend that you are hungry, and have a meal sent up, and persuade her to take some nourishment; then declare, positively, that you won\u0027t tell her anything about your adventures, until she has had a long sleep. Gholla will prepare a sleeping draught for her. \"In the meantime, I will ride off, directly I have seen my wife, to meet Surajah and your father, and bring him on here. I sha\u0027n\u0027t tell anyone who he is, in case a chance word should come to your mother\u0027s ears. If she wakes up again this evening, and asks for you, you must judge for yourself whether to tell her anything, or to wait until morning. You might, perhaps, if she seems calm, gladden her with the news that, from what you have heard, you have very strong hopes that a prisoner in keeping at one of the hill forts is your father. Then, tomorrow morning, you can tell her the whole truth. Now I will run up to Gholla. There is no time to be lost.\" \"I shall be in the dining room, Uncle, when I am wanted.\" A few minutes later, Gholla came in hastily. \"Your mother has fainted, Dick. I broke the news to her very gently, but it was too much for her, in her weak state. When she comes round again, and is able to talk, I will fetch you. In the meantime, I will send Annie in to you.\" Two minutes later the girl ran in with a flushed face, threw herself into Dick\u0027s arms, and kissed him. \"I can\u0027t help it, Dick,\" she said, \"so it is of no use your scolding me. This is a surprise. Who would have thought of your coming back so soon? But it is lucky you did. Your mother has been in a sad way, and she was so sure that you had been in some terrible danger, that I have been almost as anxious as she has. And now, it seems that I need not have frightened myself at all.\" \"I was in great danger, Annie. Just at the time my mother dreamt about me, Surajah, Ibrahim, and I were attacked by a party of Stranglers, disguised as merchants; and if it had not been that I had some strange suspicion of them, we should all have been murdered. As it was, we shot the whole gang, who, fortunately for us, had no firearms.\" \"It must have been your mother who warned you,\" Annie said gravely. \"She told us that she dreamt you were in some terrible danger, though she could not remember what it was, and she tried with all her might to warn you.\" \"Perhaps it was that, Annie. I don\u0027t know why I suspected them so strongly--Surajah quite laughed at the idea. Anyhow, it saved our lives. \"And how are you getting on, Annie? Are you happy?\" \"Oh, so happy!\" she exclaimed. \"At least, I was until your mother got ill, and I was working very hard at my lessons; but of course that has all been stopped, as far as taking them from her is concerned. But I have gone on working, and the Rajah\u0027s sons have been very good, and helped me sometimes, and I begin to read words of two letters. And what has brought you back so soon?\" \"That I can\u0027t tell you yet, Annie. I will only tell you that it is not bad news; and no one but my uncle will know more than that, till I have told my mother--even my aunt won\u0027t hear it.\" \"Has Surajah come back too, Dick?\" \"Yes; I heard horses in the courtyard just now, and I have no doubt it was him. I rode on first, being anxious to see my mother.\" They chatted for a few minutes. Then the Rajah came to the door, and called Dick into the next room. \"I have settled your father in the room at the other end of the gallery, Dick. He agreed with me that it was better for him to keep there, by himself, until you have told your mother that he is here. I have just ordered a meal to be sent, and after that will send my barber in to shave him. He says your mother will never recognise him, with all that hair on his face. I am going to see if something cannot be done to take the stain off his face, and shall then set half a dozen tailors to work on some dark blue cloth, to turn him out a suit before tomorrow morning, in what he calls sailor fashion, so that he may appear before your mother in something like the style in which she remembers him.\" A few minutes later Gholla came in, and said that Mrs. Holland was ready for Dick to go in to her. Dick found his mother looking pale and weak; but the joy of his coming had already brightened her eyes, and given a faint flush to her cheeks. \"I have been so dreadfully anxious, Dick,\" she said, after the first embrace. \"I was certain you had been in some terrible danger.\" \"I have been, but thank God I escaped; owing, I think, to the warning Annie says you tried to give me. But we must not talk about that now. I will tell you all the story tomorrow. You are not fit to talk. You must take some broth, and some wine, and a sleeping draught; and I hope you will go off, and not wake up till tomorrow morning. \"Now, you do as I tell you. While you are drinking your broth, I will go in and take something to eat, for I have had nothing today, and am as hungry as a hunter. Then I will come back, and sit by you till you go off to sleep.\" He was not long away, but he was met at the door by his aunt, who said: \"She has gone off already, Dick. I have no doubt that she will sleep many hours, but if she wakes, I will let you know at once.\" \"If that is the case, Gholla,\" the Rajah, who had come in at the same moment, said, \"I can let you into a secret, which no one but myself knows yet, but which, now that Margaret is asleep, can be told.\" Gholla was very pleased when she heard the news, and Dick went off at once to his father. It was a great relief, to the latter, to know that his wife had gone off to sleep, and would probably be well enough to have the news broken to her in the morning. \"I hear that you are preparing for the meeting, Father, by getting yourself shaved, and having a blue cloth suit made?\" \"Yes, Dick. I should like to be as much like my old self as possible.\" \"I don\u0027t think Mother will care much what you look like, Father. Still, it is very natural that you should want to get rid of all that hair.\" \"What bothers me, lad,\" Captain Holland went on, putting his hand to the back of his neck, \"is this shaved spot here. Of course, with the turban on and the native rig, it was all right, but it will look a rum affair in English clothes.\" Dick could not help laughing at his father\u0027s look of perplexity. \"Well, Father, it is just the same with myself. I have not changed yet, but when I do, the hair above, which is now tucked up under the turban, will be quite long enough to come down to the nape of the neck, and hide that bare place till the hair grows again.\" \"Yes; I did not think of that. My hair is long enough to come down over my shoulders. I was going to tell the barber to cut it short all over, but I will see now that he allows for that.\" \"Now, Father, do you mind my bringing in Annie Mansfield? I know she will be wanting to keep close to me all day, and I should never be able to get rid of her, without telling her about you.\" \"Bring her in by all means, Dick. She must be a plucky young girl, by what you said about her.\" \"Where have you been, Dick?\" Annie inquired, when Dick went out a few minutes later. \"I have been looking for you everywhere. Nobody had seen you, unless it was the Rajah. I asked him, and he said that little girls must not ask questions, and then laughed. \"You have not brought home another white girl?\" she exclaimed suddenly. \"Would it not be very nice for you to have a companion, Annie?\" \"No,\" she said sharply; \"I should not like it at all.\" \"Well, I will take you in to see her, and I think you will like her. \"No; I am only joking,\" he broke off, as he saw tears start into her eyes. \"It is not another girl. But you shall see for yourself.\" He took her hand, and led her to his father\u0027s room. \"There, Annie, this is the gentleman who has come back with me this time.\" Annie looked at Captain Holland in surprise, and then turned her eyes to Dick for an explanation. \"He is a respectable-looking old native, isn\u0027t he, Annie?\" \"Yes, he looks respectable,\" Annie said gravely; \"but he doesn\u0027t look very old. Why has he come down with you, Dick? He can\u0027t have been a slave.\" \"But I have, lass,\" the captain said, in English, to Annie\u0027s intense astonishment. \"I have been in their hands a year or so longer than you were.\" Annie turned impulsively to Dick, and grasped his arm. \"Oh, Dick,\" she said, in an excited whisper. \"Is it--is it your father, after all?\" \"Ay, lass,\" the captain answered for him. \"I am the boy\u0027s father, and a happy father, too, as you may guess, at finding I have such a son. And I hear he has been a good friend to you, too.\" \"Oh, he has, he has indeed!\" Annie cried, running forward and seizing his hands in both of hers. \"I don\u0027t think there ever was anyone so kind and good.\" \"What bosh, Annie!\" Dick exclaimed, almost crossly. \"Never mind what he says, my dear. You and I know all about it. Now we can do very well without him, for a time. He can go and tell his uncle and cousins all about his adventures, which, I have no doubt, they are dying to hear; and you and I can sit here, and exchange confidences until my barber comes. I don\u0027t look much like an Englishman now, but I hope that they will be able to get me something that will take this stain off my face.\" Mrs. Holland did not wake till evening. She seemed very much better, and had a short chat with Dick. She would have got up, had he not told her that he should be going to bed himself, in a short time, and that all his story would keep very well until the morning, when he hoped to find her quite herself again. By dint of the application of various unguents, and a vast amount of hard scrubbing, Captain Holland restored his face to its original hue. \"I look a bit sunburnt,\" he said, \"but I have often come back, browner than this, from some of my voyages.\" \"You look quite like yourself, in your portrait at home, Father,\" Dick said. \"It is the shaving and cutting your hair, even more than getting off the dye, that has made the difference. I don\u0027t think you look much older than you did then, except that there are a few grey hairs.\" \"I shall look better tomorrow, Dick, when I get these outlandish things off. I have been trying on my new suit, and I think it will do, first rate. Those clothes that you wore on board ship, and handed to them as a model, gave them the idea of what I wanted.\" And indeed, the next morning, when Captain Holland appeared in his new suit, Dick declared that he looked just as if he had walked down from his picture. The ranee had agreed to break the news to Mrs. Holland, as soon as she was dressed. She came into the room where the others were waiting for breakfast, and said to Captain Holland: \"Come. She knows all, and has borne it well.\" She led him to the door of Mrs. Holland\u0027s room, and opened it. As he entered there was a cry of: \"Oh Jack! My Jack!\" Then she closed it behind him, and left husband and wife together. A few days afterwards, there was a family consultation. \"Now, Dick,\" his father said, \"we must settle about your plans. You know we have decided upon going home, by the next ship, and taking Annie with us, without waiting for her father\u0027s letter. Of course I shall have no difficulty in finding out, when I get there, what his address is. I have promised your mother to give up the sea, and settle down again at Shadwell, where I can meet old friends and shall feel at home. We have had a long talk over what you said the other night, about your insisting that we should take the money those jewels of yours fetch. Well, we won\u0027t do that.\" \"Then I will sell them, Father,\" Dick said positively, \"and give the money to a hospital!\" \"I have not finished yet, Dick. We won\u0027t take all the money, but we have agreed that we will take a quarter of it. Of course, we could manage on my savings, as your mother did when I was away. We shall lose the little allowance the Company made her, but I shall buy a share in a ship with my money, which will bring in a good deal better rate of interest than she got for it in the funds, so we could still manage very well. Still, as we feel that it would please you, we agree to take a quarter of the money the jewels fetch; and that, with what I have, will give us an income well beyond our wants. So that is settled. \"Now, about yourself. I really don\u0027t think that you can do better than what you proposed, when we were talking of it yesterday. You would be like a fish out of water, in England, if you had nothing to occupy your time; and therefore can\u0027t do better than enter the Service here, and remain, at any rate, for a few years. \"As your commission was dated from the time you joined Lord Cornwallis, two and a half years ago, you won\u0027t be at the bottom of the tree, and while you are serving you will want no money here, and the interest of your capital will be accumulating. If I invest it in shipping for you, you will get eight or ten percent for it; and as I shall pick good ships, commanded by men I know, and will divide the money up in small shares, among half a dozen of them, there will be practically no risk--and of course the vessels will be insured. So that, at the end of ten years, by reinvesting the profits, your money will be more than doubled, and you will have a nice fortune when you choose to come home, even if the jewels do not fetch anything like what you expect.\" A week later the party journeyed down to Madras, where they stayed for a fortnight. Dick, on his arrival, called upon the governor, who congratulated him most heartily when he heard that he had succeeded in finding and releasing his father, and at once appointed him to one of the native cavalry regiments; and his parents had the satisfaction of seeing him in uniform before they started. Annie showed but little interest in the thought of going to England, and being restored to her parents, being at the time too much distressed at parting from Dick to give any thought to other matters. But at last the goodbyes were all said, and, as the anchor was weighed, Dick returned on shore in a surf boat, and next day joined his regiment. Surajah had wanted to accompany him to Madras, and to enlist in any regiment to which he might be appointed; and the assurance that it might be a long time before he became a native officer, as these were always chosen from the ranks, except in the case of raising new regiments, had little influence with him. The Rajah, however, had finally persuaded him to stay, by the argument that his father, who was now getting on in years, would sorely miss him; that the captain of the troop would also be retiring shortly; and that he should, as a reward for his faithful services to his nephew, appoint him to the command as soon as it was vacant. Ibrahim entered the Rajah\u0027s service, preferring that to soldiering. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3123/85911.html","bookId":901,"book":{"id":901,"title":"The Tiger of Mysore","description":"简介： While some of our wars in India are open to the charge that they were undertaken on slight provocation, and were forced on by us in order that we might have an excuse for annexation, our struggle with Tippoo Saib was, on the other hand, marked by a l...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3123","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:50 AM"}}
