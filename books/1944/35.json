{"id":67117,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"When she finished she reread the e-mail. In it, she shared her concern for Kelly and Paul and their struggles to have a second child. She wrote humorously about her trials with Sherlock, and how the kitten refused to be ignored, describing the inventive ways he pestered her until Grace lavished attention on him. This was Grace\u0027s own less-than-subtle way of telling Cliff she wouldn\u0027t go away, either. Not this time. The next afternoon, during lunch, Grace walked down to the corner drugstore and purchased a handful of cards, some clever, a couple that had dramatic photos of horses, and a few romantic ones. As soon as she got home from work, she hurried to her computer, animals in tow, and logged on to the Internet, hoping for a response from Cliff. Her heart fell when she found none. \"Did you think this would be easy?\" she said to Buttercup. Sherlock scratched at her leg until Grace lifted him onto her lap. She petted him with one hand and typed with the other while she considered the possibilities. It could be that Cliff had deleted the e-mail without even opening it. Or decided to ignore it. Or perhaps he hadn\u0027t checked his messages lately. She e-mailed him a second time and mailed off a card the following morning. Eventually she\u0027d wear him down, as Lisa had said. Eventually he\u0027d see she wasn\u0027t going away. She loved Cliff. He was the best thing in her life and she refused to give him up. Thirty-Six \"Bob!\" Peggy shouted from the foot of the stairs. \"Phone!\" Bob laid down the script of Chicago—he\u0027d been memorizing his lines—and walked to the top of the stairs. He\u0027d been so intent on the scene, he hadn\u0027t even heard the phone ring. \"Who is it?\" he called. Wearing her \"Kiss the Cook\" apron, Peggy stood there looking up at him. \"He didn\u0027t say.\" Mumbling under his breath, Bob hurried to the master bedroom and picked up the phone. \"Hello,\" he muttered impatiently. \"Robert Beldon? This is Colonel Stewart Samuels.\" The crisp military tones went through Bob like an electrical charge. It was the voice of a man he\u0027d hoped never to hear from again. The voice of the man who\u0027d led him into battle. A soldier who\u0027d stood with him in a Southeast Asian jungle. Who\u0027d saved his life and then, at the same moment, robbed him of it. \"Yes.\" With difficulty he managed to respond. \"I\u0027m going to be in the Seattle area in the next few weeks. We need to talk.\" It\u0027d been more than thirty years since Bob had last spoken with his commanding officer. He could go another thirty years and it would suit him just fine. So far, the only person in contact with Samuels had been Troy Davis. Bob would\u0027ve preferred to keep it that way. The colonel continued, giving the details of his trip to the Pacific Northwest. Bob stood rigid until the other man announced he intended to visit Cedar Cove. \"Is that necessary?\" Bob demanded. Seattle was too close for comfort, but having him in Cedar Cove for any length of time was downright intimidating. \"I believe it is. There\u0027s a matter between us that requires resolution.\" How formal he sounded. So cold-blooded and hard. \"Two of our comrades are dead, one a suicide and one murdered,\" he said. \"I\u0027m hoping we can figure this out, once and for all. Agreed?\" \"Yes, I—\" Bob wasn\u0027t given a chance to finish his sentence. \"Good. I\u0027ll have my assistant make the arrangements.\" Before Bob could comment further, the phone went dead. Bob stood there unseeing, his hand still on the receiver. After a moment, he replaced the phone and slowly, almost as if he were in a trance, wanted down the stairs. Peggy was in the kitchen with Hannah preparing dinner. When she saw him she abruptly stopped mashing the potatoes. \"Who was that on the phone?\" she asked, walking toward him. He stared at her, still numb inside. \"Colonel Samuels.\" \"Stewart Samuels?\" Hannah repeated, moving closer to Peggy. Peggy glanced at Bob and then at Hannah. \"What did he want?\" \"He\u0027s coming to Cedar Cove.\" Hannah let out a small cry of alarm and quickly covered her mouth. \"What\u0027s he coming for, did he say?\" Peggy wrapped her arm around the young woman\u0027s shoulders. \"Why are you so afraid?\" Bob wasn\u0027t sure if the question was directed at him or Hannah, but their guest was the one who answered. \"He\u0027s just so... military.\" \"I thought you were grateful to him for all his help with your father,\" Peggy said, looking at Hannah. \"I was... I am. Dad never would\u0027ve gotten the medical care he needed if it hadn\u0027t been for Colonel Samuels. But... he frightens me.\" She trembled as if a chill had overtaken her. \"Bob?\" His wife turned to him for answers he couldn\u0027t give. \"What\u0027s going on?\" \"I don\u0027t know. He said he had business in the area and felt we should talk. He asked that I set up a meeting with Roy and the sheriff, too.\" Peggy frowned. \"Does he think Dan Sherman\u0027s death and Hannah\u0027s father\u0027s are linked?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" But it was more than that. Samuels had indicated that he had business with him, too. Bob didn\u0027t want to see Stewart Samuels, didn\u0027t want to be reminded of the past, and yet it was there, confronting him, and had been every day since his return from Vietnam. That night, unable to sleep, Bob lay in bed and stared at the ceiling. The digital clock by the telephone told him it was after two, but he was wide awake. Peggy slept peacefully beside him, oblivious to his anguish. A full moon cast shadows on the walls. With the window open, the scent of the cove, of seawater, wafted toward him. He usually found it relaxing, but tonight his mind refused to let him rest. Every time he closed his eyes, all Bob could see, hear, taste and smell was Vietnam. Tension filled him. He didn\u0027t want to go back to those memories, didn\u0027t want to think about them, didn\u0027t want to feel. Suddenly he heard the glass door off the kitchen sliding open. Bob\u0027s eyes widened with fear. He lay perfectly still as the noise drifted up the stairwell—a noise so slight Bob was sure he must be mistaken. As he strained to hear, the sound of muffled footsteps sent fear shooting through his veins. His adrenaline kicked in and he folded back the sheet and sat on the edge of the bed. Sweat broke out across his forehead. Leaning forward, he closed his eyes to listen more closely, hoping this was his imagination, after all. But the warnings Roy had given him rushed through his mind and he remembered the car that had followed him. Bob looked around for something he could use to defend himself. He found nothing. His golf clubs were in the garage, and the sturdiest thing he could take with him was a work boot. Peggy stirred. Even in her slumber she must have sensed his fear. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" she whispered. He brought his finger to his lips. \"Someone\u0027s downstairs.\" Bob felt his wife stiffen. She grabbed his arm and scrambled to a sitting position. \"How did they get in?\" \"The patio door.\" \"Did you lock it?\" He nodded. \"Should we phone 911?\" Peggy whispered. A board creaked at the bottom of the stairs. Whoever was in the house was coming after them. It was too late to call the sheriff\u0027s office. Both Bob and Peggy froze in horror. Nothing. In that one beat of his heart, Bob acted. He refused to sit and wait. If someone had come to kill him, he wasn\u0027t going to die without putting up a hell of a fight. Roaring off the bed, he stormed out of the room. Peggy cried out in an effort to stop him. Fumbling with the light, she lunged for the phone as Bob flew out of the bedroom and into the hallway. He smacked the light switch with his palm. There, standing at the foot of the stairs, was Hannah. She gasped at the sight of him. \"Hannah!\" he cried, furious with her for the scare she\u0027d given him. \"It\u0027s Hannah,\" he shouted back at his wife. \"What the hell are you doing sneaking around the house at this time of night?\" he demanded. She cowered before him, quaking, with her head bowed. Her long hair spilled over her shoulders and hid her face. \"Hannah, for heaven\u0027s sake, what are you doing?\" Peggy ran down the stairs, tying her robe as she did. \"I __\" Bob found a folded sheet of paper on the downstairs hall carpet and leaned down to pick it up. A glance told him it was a farewell note from Hannah. \"I... I thought it was time for me to go,\" the young woman said, her voice so low it was hard to distinguish the words. \"But why would you sneak away in the middle of the night?\" Peggy asked. Hannah shrugged one shoulder. Apparently the I-don\u0027t-know shrug was supposed to explain everything. \"I\u0027m afraid!\" she wailed. Seconds later, she broke into sobs. Peggy immediately slipped an arm around Hannah and guided her into the kitchen. Hannah\u0027s suitcase sat in front of the patio door. Apparently she\u0027d opened it and then decided to leave a note at the foot of the stairs. Bob collapsed at the kitchen table, so badly shaken he couldn\u0027t stop trembling. He wanted to scream at Hannah, frighten her the way she\u0027d frightened him, but he knew he dare not. \"Why are you afraid?\" Peggy asked gently once she\u0027d sat Hannah down. She filled the kettle and put it on the stove for tea. \"I don\u0027t know... I lost both my parents. I can\u0027t bear the thought of losing you, too.\" \"Why do you think you would?\" Peggy asked quietly. \"Because...\" \"Does this have to do with Colonel Samuels\u0027s visit?\" Peggy asked next. Hannah didn\u0027t answer, but Bob suspected Peggy was right. For her own reasons, their guest was as worried about the man\u0027s visit as he was himself. Thirty-Seven Olivia hung her robe in her chamber closet and collected her purse, preparing to leave the courthouse at the end of another long day. Couple after couple stood before her with their lives in shambles, eager to tear apart their homes, willing to destroy their children\u0027s security. Each partner seemed intent on proving that he or she was perfectly capable of surviving without the other. There was so much anger and bitterness, so much false pride. Some days she found her task of deciding the fate of these families overwhelming. She glanced at her watch as she headed toward the parking lot. She was meeting Grace for dinner that evening. It was the first time since Olivia\u0027s marriage that Grace had asked to see her outside of their aerobics class on Wednesday night. They phoned each other fairly regularly and occasionally met at the Farmers\u0027 Market on Saturday mornings, but her marriage had changed their relationship. They were each discovering how to proceed under these new terms. Olivia welcomed the opportunity to talk to her lifelong friend. There were things she wanted to discuss—things she couldn\u0027t really talk about with anyone else. And something in Grace\u0027s voice told her she had concerns of her own. Once in her car, she drove the short distance between the courthouse and The Lighthouse Restaurant. Her daughter and son-in-law had done a marvelous job and she was proud of their success. Still, as a mother, Olivia worried. Justine was working too hard; she was a young wife and mother, in addition to managing the restaurant\u0027s books and occasionally filling in as hostess. As luck would have it, Justine was working that night. Her face brightened when she saw Olivia. \"Hey, Mom,\" she said with a quick hug. \"It\u0027s good to see you.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-35.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) Dear Reader, I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
