{"id":67104,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Twenty-Three\n Ian Randall was in no hurry to get home. For six months at sea, he\u0027d counted every second he was away from Cecilia. He\u0027d crossed off each day on the calendar until they could be together again, eagerly anticipating their reunion. Being apart from her was agony. But now that he was home, he could hardly stand to be around her because it was an even deeper agony to have her there and not make love to her.\n As he neared the highway exit that would take him home, Ian slowed the vehicle to a near-crawl. He dreaded what would happen once he walked into the duplex. The tension between them had begun the instant she announced she wanted another baby, and it seemed to increase day by day.\n Cecilia tried to pretend everything was as it should be, tried to ignore his bad mood. Every night it was the same: she arrived home from work and immediately set about preparing dinner. While he buried his face in the newspaper, she talked about her day in the office. She was employed by a large accounting firm in Cedar Cove and liked her job, as much as Ian liked his. Above all, they did love each other; there was no question of that. They should be happy.\n Nights were the worst. He made excuses not to go to bed at the same time as his wife. He saw the hurt in her eyes, but not once did she confront him.\n If Cecilia had brought the situation out into the open, it might have helped. She wanted a baby and the fact was, he didn\u0027t. Cecilia had let him know that if they were going to use birth control, it was up to him. After that one disastrous night when she\u0027d seduced him, he decided making love to Cecilia was just too dangerous.\n She made him forget. As soon as she was in his arms, he lost all thought except his need for her. The risk of getting her pregnant was just too high.\n There\u0027d been a few nights when he\u0027d given in—and been furious with himself afterward. He\u0027d crawled into bed, assuming she was asleep. She wasn\u0027t, and he\u0027d surrendered every time without even token resistance. Before he knew how he\u0027d allowed it to happen, they\u0027d made love, and on at least two of those occasions, it was without protection.... He tried to sleep on the sofa, but Cecilia wouldn\u0027t let him, insisting she\u0027d sleep there with him.\n The only way to be safe was to avoid her. Unfortunately, his self-imposed abstinence didn\u0027t always work. Ian had never viewed himself as an undisciplined man; the navy had drilled self-discipline into him from the minute he set foot in boot camp. But when it came to his wife, he had little resistance.\n Those times he hadn\u0027t used protection—Cecilia was bound to get caught if she hadn\u0027t been already.\n Ian couldn\u0027t bear the thought of another pregnancy going wrong. Losing Allison had nearly destroyed them both. Healing would come in time; he was sure of it. If only Cecilia wouldn\u0027t press the issue.\n As he approached the stop sign off the freeway, Ian took a left instead of a right, going in the opposite direction from home. He drove through unfamiliar streets, dread building in him. The second he walked in the door, it would be the same thing all over again—the same desire, the same frustration. He could feel it.\n By sheer force of will, he hadn\u0027t touched Cecilia in three nights. It had been torture, and Ian just knew he wouldn\u0027t be able to resist her tonight.\n When he discovered that he was driving down the road to the cemetery where his daughter was buried, Ian slowed and turned in. His baby girl had died after living only a few days. She\u0027d been born with a defective heart and there was nothing the doctors could do. As a submariner he\u0027d been under the polar ice cap at the time and unable to be with Cecilia. In fact, he hadn\u0027t even known about his daughter\u0027s birth until he learned of her death. Upon his return, he\u0027d requested reassignment aboard an aircraft carrier, and that request had been granted.\n Parking the car, Ian climbed out. Hands in his pockets, he walked over to Allison\u0027s grave, where he stood on the grass staring down at the small marker that recorded the dates of her birth and death. Amazing, really, that so little information could involve so much pain.\n He gazed down at the marker for several minutes. \"Hello, Allison,\" he whispered. He talked to his daughter whenever he visited her grave. He\u0027d never even seen her, never had a chance to hold her or kiss her and he felt cheated to have been denied this one small consolation. The only photo of Allison had been taken in the hospital shortly after her birth. She\u0027d been so tiny. Her life, so short and traumatic, had been filled with pain. Each breath was a struggle.\n \"I see your mother\u0027s been by,\" Ian said. He noticed the single pink rose, a sure sign that Cecilia had visited recently.\n He didn\u0027t know how often his wife came to the cemetery, but he suspected it was every three or four days. \"Did she tell you she wants another baby?\"\n Ian took a deep breath. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea.\" He smiled as he said it. \"The thing is, I wasn\u0027t ready when your mother told me she was pregnant with you. You took me by surprise, you know? I didn\u0027t realize a girl could get pregnant that easily.\" He hadn\u0027t been unhappy at the news, however; he\u0027d been excited because it\u0027d given him a good excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway—marry Cecilia.\n His smile faded. Even when she got pregnant, Cecilia wasn\u0027t that keen on marriage. She had all kinds of stipulations. Apparently her mother had been pregnant with her when she married Cecilia\u0027s father, and the marriage had been a disaster from the beginning. Cecilia had no intention of repeating her mother\u0027s mistakes, so she\u0027d insisted on a prenuptial agreement. It was lunacy, but he would\u0027ve signed anything. The prenuptial had saved him in the end because Judge Lockhart had denied the divorce based primarily on that agreement.\n \"Your mother doesn\u0027t know this yet, but we might be heading back to sea.\" Although he hadn\u0027t told Cecilia, once orders came through, the word would be out soon enough. Under current circumstances, the navy wasn\u0027t likely to allow him the luxury of a long shore duty. That was the bad news as well as the good. He didn\u0027t want to leave Cecilia again, especially so soon, but he knew that if he was in port much longer, she\u0027d get pregnant for sure.\n \"Look after your mother while I\u0027m away, will you, sweetheart?\" he asked. \"Let her know how much I love her.\"\n He waited a moment, nearly overwhelmed by sadness. What astonished him was how much love he felt for his little girl. This was a child he\u0027d never had the privilege of kissing good-night or cradling in his arms, and yet she was as much a part of him as his own heart.\n Ten minutes later, Ian left the cemetery and drove home. He half-expected Cecilia to comment that he was later than usual or ask where he\u0027d been. She didn\u0027t. She was busy in the kitchen and barely looked up when he walked in the door.\n \"Did you have a good day?\" she asked.\n After glancing at the mail, he picked up the evening newspaper and settled into his favorite chair. \"All right, I guess.\"\n He opened the front section of the paper to block her from his sight. He found it incredibly sexy to watch his wife, walking barefoot in the kitchen in shorts and a cropped T-shirt. She dressed like that on purpose; Ian was convinced of it. The minute she got home from the office, she changed out of her business clothes and into something seductive. Half the time he couldn\u0027t keep his eyes off her.\n \"I had an all-right day, too,\" she said conversationally as she carried a large bowl to the table. \"I made us a taco salad.\"\n He nodded. \"Thanks.\"\n \"Are you hungry?\"\n \"Sort of.\" His appetite hadn\u0027t been good since he\u0027d returned home. That was just another sign of the tension he\u0027d been under lately.\n \"Dinner\u0027s ready,\" Cecilia said, sitting down at the table.\n With little enthusiasm, Ian set the newspaper aside and joined her. Most nights he didn\u0027t contribute much to the conversation; Cecilia did practically all the talking. Every now and then, he\u0027d ask her something because the silences troubled him more than the sound of her chatter.\n This evening, however, she didn\u0027t seem to feel like talking, either. He was relieved when she finished dinner and brought her plate to the sink. Apparently her appetite wasn\u0027t good, either.\n \"Are you feeling okay?\" he asked.\n \"I\u0027m fine.\"\n Ian frowned, unsure if he should believe that. But then she smiled so sweetly he couldn\u0027t doubt her.\n They spent the evening in silence, each of them reading— Cecilia a magazine and he a thriller someone at work had lent him. By nine, she was yawning. \"I\u0027m going to bed.\"\n He nodded. \"I feel like staying up and reading for a while longer.\"\n She didn\u0027t argue with him, but accepted his excuse. Then she wandered into the bedroom and closed the door. So far so good, he thought as he relaxed in his chair.\n Ian made a genuine effort to read, but his mind was on everything except the words on the page in front of him. Nine o\u0027clock was damned early for Cecilia to go to bed, he realized all of a sudden. He couldn\u0027t figure out why she\u0027d done that. She almost always stayed up until at least ten.\n At nine-thirty, he turned out the lights and walked into the darkened bedroom. It took his eyes a moment to adjust to the lack of light. Cecilia was curled up on her side of the bed, and he knew instantly that she was awake.\n \"Cecilia?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"You awake?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"Something\u0027s wrong, isn\u0027t it?\"\n She didn\u0027t answer him.\n The mattress dipped when he sat on the edge of the bed. \"You\u0027d better tell me.\" His heart was starting to pound.\n She pretended not to hear him. \"Cecilia?\"\n \"Are you coming to bed?\"\n He supposed the only way he could get her to talk was to join her in bed, so he undressed and slipped beneath the covers. Cecilia moved closer but didn\u0027t touch him. \"Will you hold me?\" she whispered.\n \"Okay.\" He lay on his back and Cecilia pressed her head against his shoulder. He wrapped his arm around her. She felt small in his embrace, smaller than usual.\n He waited but she didn\u0027t say anything. In his heart he knew. He should\u0027ve guessed right away, he supposed, but denial could be downright comfortable. \"You\u0027re pregnant, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes.\" She sobbed once. \"Are you angry?\"\n He snorted softly. \"No. I don\u0027t have anyone to blame but me.\"\n \"I wanted everything to be different than with Allison. I thought you\u0027d be angry then, too, and instead you were so nice about it.\"\n He didn\u0027t have anything to say to that.\n \"The news of a baby should make us happy.\"\n \"Are you happy?\" he asked.\n Cecilia didn\u0027t answer right away. \"I\u0027d be leaping up and down for joy if you were pleased.\"\n His fears wouldn\u0027t let him feel good about this. \"I\u0027m afraid, Cecilia,\" he finally said.\n \"I am, too, but I want our baby so much. I love you, Ian. You got home almost two months ago, and this whole time\u0027s been awful. It\u0027s... it\u0027s like you hate me.\"\n \"Cecilia, no...\"\n \"What else am I to think? You hardly talk to me and you won\u0027t even go to bed when I do. You think I don\u0027t know why? You don\u0027t want to make love to me and whenever you do, you hate yourself for it.\"\n She certainly had him pegged. \"I got you pregnant, didn\u0027t I?\u0027\n He could feel her nod.\n \"Yeah, well, you knew how I felt.\"\n \"You knew how I felt, too!\" She sniffled, apparently trying not to cry. \"I want this baby and I want my husband to love me and be excited and happy and you\u0027re not. It\u0027s tearing me up inside.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-22.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: \n 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) \n Dear Reader, \n I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
