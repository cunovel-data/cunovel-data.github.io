{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) Dear Reader, I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B. Turns out his name was Max Russell, and Bob had known him briefly in Vietnam.We still don\u0027t have any idea why he came here and—most important of all—who killed him. Because it now appears that he was poisoned. I sure hope somebody figures it out soon! Not that we\u0027re providing the only news in Cedar Cove these days. I heard that Jon Bowman and Maryellen Sherman are getting married. And Maryellen\u0027s mom, Grace, has more than her share of interested men! The question is: Which one is she going to choose? Olivia—I guess it\u0027s Olivia Griffin now— is back from her honeymoon, and her mother, Charlotte (who\u0027s in her mid-seventies at least), seems to have a man in her life, too. I\u0027m not sure Olivia\u0027s too pleased…. There\u0027s lots of other gossip I could tell you. Come by for a cup of tea and one of my blueberry muffins and we\u0027ll talk.
