Mom and my sister and a few friends, but there are a couple of people I\u0027d like to invite and I don\u0027t know if you\u0027d approve.\"\n Katie squealed and dropped the heavy-bottomed cup on her tray.\n Jon kissed Maryellen\u0027s temple. \"You know there\u0027s almost nothing I can refuse you. Who do you want to invite?\"\n She leaned into him, not wanting to see his face when she told him. \"Your father and stepmother.\" Jon had only recently revealed how his parents had chosen to protect his younger brother at his expense. They had lied on the witness stand and, as a result, Jon had been convicted of dealing drugs. He\u0027d served seven years in prison. Not once in all those years or the years since had he spoken to either his father or his stepmother.\n Jon tensed and slowly released Maryellen. \"No. They are no longer part of my life. They cast me aside and—\"\n \"You\u0027re all they have left.\" His brother had died a tragic death and Maryellen was convinced that his family regretted what they\u0027d done, both in betraying Jon and in not forcing his brother to face the consequences of his crime.\n Jon clasped her shoulders hard, almost hurting her with the fervor of his emotions. \"We will never speak of this again, understand? I have no family other than you and Katie.\" Taking a shuddery breath, he let her go.\n She wanted to argue, and longed to help heal the relationship between Jon and his family, but she could see he wasn\u0027t ready. His parents had a granddaughter they knew nothing about. Surely that was an opportunity for new beginnings. Still, it wasn\u0027t Maryellen\u0027s place to step in, especially since Jon\u0027s feelings on the subject were this adamant.\n \"What about a honeymoon?\" Jon asked. \"Nothing fancy, but someplace we can get away for a night or two.\"\n \"You want a honeymoon?\" Maryellen had been so involved with plans for her move and for the actual wedding, she hadn\u0027t given a honeymoon any thought.\n \"Damn straight I want a honeymoon.\"\n \"What about Thyme and Tide?\" Bob and Peggy Beldon\u0027s Bed and Breakfast was said to be the best in town.\n Jon shook his head. \"I already looked into that, but they aren\u0027t taking guests until this murder is solved.\"\n \"Oh...\" That was a disappointment.\n \"How about a night in Seattle? Just the two of us. Your mother will take Katie, won\u0027t she?\"\n Maryellen laughed softly. \"In a heartbeat.\"\n \"Seattle, then?\"\n Maryellen nodded.\n \"The honeymoon will be the very best part.\" Jon kissed her nose, and Katie giggled as if she\u0027d never seen anything funnier. \"That amuses you, does it?\" Jon said, smiling. \"I guess I see your point.\"\n \"We\u0027re going to have a beautiful wedding,\" Maryellen said with certainty. The prospect of it made this chaos of packing and moving seem worthwhile. Within a couple of weeks she\u0027d be Jon\u0027s wife. The three of them would be a family.\n Four\n Charlotte Jefferson dressed nervously for her court appearance. She\u0027d spent many an afternoon in the Kitsap County Courthouse, proudly watching her only daughter officiate as a family court judge. In Charlotte\u0027s opinion, her daughter was one of the wisest judges in the entire state. She got a thrill just watching Olivia mete out decisions, looking so official in her black robe.\n This afternoon, however, Charlotte wouldn\u0027t be in Olivia\u0027s courtroom but in Judge Robson\u0027s. She wouldn\u0027t be alone, either. Together with several of her dearest friends, she\u0027d be facing the consequences of civil disobedience. Still, serving time in the slammer, if it came to that, would be a small price to pay if her actions got the town council to finally bring a health clinic to Cedar Cove.\n Laura, Bess and the others, including Ben Rhodes, were scheduled to meet her in the foyer outside Judge Robson\u0027s courtroom at one o\u0027clock.\n Charlotte donned her best Sunday dress, complete with the Easter hat she\u0027d purchased back in 1966. It was a broad-brimmed yellow one with a single white plume tucked in the satin band. If Judge Robson decided to incarcerate her and the others, she intended to walk into that jail cell as finely dressed as she would\u0027ve been for any church service.\n Olivia and Jack didn\u0027t seem to think a prison term was likely, but Charlotte had heard rumors about Judge Robson. He was supposed to be much more by-the-book than Olivia, more of a hard-liner, and—again according to rumor— fond of making an example of the occasional miscreant.\n The doorbell chimed and Harry, her cat, leaped down from the foot of her bed with an uncharacteristic display of energy and trotted into the living room. Since Olivia and Jack were out of town on their honeymoon, Charlotte wondered who it might be. Embarrassment had prevented her from asking Justine, her granddaughter, to accompany her. Olivia, of course, was well aware of the entire situation, unhappily so. But Charlotte refused to let the rest of her family and friends know, although it was impossible to keep such news completely quiet.\n The peephole in the front door answered her question. Ben Rhodes stood on the other side, looking as dapper and debonair as ever. Despite her age, her heart did a tiny flip-flop at the sight of him. After all these years as a widow, she\u0027d assumed she was too old and set in her ways to fall in love, but Ben had shown her that even long-held assumptions could be wrong.\n \"Ben!\" She unbolted the four dead bolt locks on her front door. \"What are you doing here?\" she demanded, although she was more than glad to see him. \"We\u0027re supposed to meet at the courthouse, remember?\"\n \"I know, but I thought I\u0027d escort my favorite gal into court. Are you ready?\"\n Charlotte straightened the skirt of her floral dress, feeling, for just a second, like the heroine in a 1950s musical.\n Ben made the whole mess seem like an adventure rather than a scandal—or worse. \"How do I look?\"\n A smile lazily crossed Ben\u0027s full mouth. At times it was difficult to forget that he wasn\u0027t really Cesar Romero, the wonderful Cuban actor. In her opinion, Ben could have been the other man\u0027s double. \"You look lovely,\" he told her.\n But adventure or not, Charlotte couldn\u0027t quite control her nervousness. \"Oh, dear...I just don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen to us.\"\n Ben gently patted her hand. \"I don\u0027t believe the council wants that kind of negative publicity. I can just imagine what the Seattle newspapers would say about a town punishing a handful of senior citizens because we were demonstrating for health care.\"\n \"Unlawful assembly,\" Charlotte muttered under her breath. \"I, for one, am willing to serve my time if that\u0027s what it takes to wake this town up.\" Just being with Ben strengthened her resolve. He made her feel brave, helped her stand up for her principles and act on the power of her convictions.\n \"I completely agree with you. However...\" He hesitated and then forcefully expelled his breath. \"I don\u0027t think we need to worry about serving jail time. We\u0027ll probably just be fined.\"\n Charlotte just couldn\u0027t be sure. She was worried, especially considering Judge Robson\u0027s reputation. Would she be viewed as the ringleader? She felt particularly anxious about her friends, who\u0027d stood loyally by her when she defied Sheriff Davis.\n \"I\u0027ve hired an attorney,\" Ben informed her. Earlier Ben had agreed to represent them in court, but apparently he\u0027d changed his mind.\n Charlotte hadn\u0027t wanted to involve lawyers. For one thing, they charged an arm and a leg, and for another, whatever lawyer Ben had chosen was bound to say something to Olivia when she returned. Charlotte wanted Olivia to know as little as possible, difficult though that would be. She\u0027d hoped to hold down the gossip.\n \"Sharon Castor said she\u0027d meet us at the courthouse.\"\n \"Not Sharon Castor,\" Charlotte cried. The attorney was frequently in Olivia\u0027s courtroom. In fact, Sharon had recently represented Rosemary Cox in her divorce case. Charlotte had been present when her daughter had handed down one of her most controversial joint-custody decisions—a decision that, Charlotte believed, had led to the couple\u0027s reconciliation.\n \"Oh, dear,\" she said and sighed. \"We might as well go.\" She went into the bedroom for her overnight case, which contained her medications and night cream, and reached for her jacket. Just in case... The day was cool, and from everything she\u0027d read, jail cells were notoriously drafty. She glanced around her bedroom one last time. Once she\u0027d received her sentence, if the worst happened, she\u0027d contact Justine and ask her to take care of Harry.\n \"Charlotte,\" Ben said, shaking his head as she entered the living room. \"You aren\u0027t going to need a suitcase.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be so sure,\" she countered grimly. \"Suppose Judge Robson decides to make an example of me. I want to be ready.\" She\u0027d long been a believer in preparing for the worst—and hoping for the best.\n Ben tried to argue with her, but she refused to change her mind. In the end, he placed her suitcase in the trunk of his car.\n When they arrived at the courthouse, Helen, Laura and Bess were already gathered in the foyer outside Judge Rob-son\u0027s courtroom. The three women rushed frantically to Charlotte\u0027s side.\n \"I\u0027m telling you right now, no one\u0027s going to do a body search on me and live to tell about it,\" Bess declared. She raised her hands in the familiar karate posture. Their entire SeniorCenter had taken self-defense lessons a few years back and Bess had faithfully attended every class.\n \"Have you been watching those Karate Kid videos again?\" Charlotte muttered.\n Bess glared at her. \"I\u0027m not joking, Charlotte.\"\n \"Do you think the judge will let us bring our knitting needles into jail?\" Laura asked. \"If you want the truth, I have several Christmas projects I\u0027d like to start and frankly I could make good use of the downtime.\"\n Just as Charlotte began to reply, Sharon Castor strolled up to Ben. \"This is everyone?\" she asked.\n Ben nodded.\n \"Ben\u0027s hired us legal representation,\" Charlotte whispered to her friends. \"He seems to think all the judge will do is fine us.\"\n \"That\u0027s all?\" Laura sounded disappointed. \"I was looking forward to prison.\"\n In contrast, Bess folded her hands together and raised her eyes toward heaven. \"God bless Ben.\"\n Charlotte had to admit she was grateful not to have this entire matter fall upon her shoulders. She was the one who\u0027d led her friends into trouble, and she felt responsible for whatever befell them as a result.\n \"We\u0027re up next,\" Sharon Castor announced. \"Let\u0027s go into the courtroom together.\"\n Charlotte adjusted her hat. Ben took her hand and the small party walked into the courtroom. Sharon was in the lead, with Bess, Helen and Laura marching right behind her, and Charlotte and Ben bringing up the rear.\n To Charlotte\u0027s astonishment, the courtroom was packed— standing room only. The first people to catch her attention were Bob and Peggy Beldon from the Thyme and Tide Bed and Breakfast.\n \"We\u0027re with you, Charlotte,\" Peggy called out.\n Justine and her husband, Seth, were there, too. Seth held on to Leif, who was almost two years old. The toddler squirmed in his father\u0027s arms, but stilled when he saw Charlotte. Justine waved, and Charlotte\u0027s eyes blurred with tears, which she furiously blinked back. It seemed half the town had shown up to offer them support. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-4.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: \n 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) \n Dear Reader, \n I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
