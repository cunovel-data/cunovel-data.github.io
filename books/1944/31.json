{"id":67113,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"Olivia sat at her desk and glanced up, a look of curiosity on her face. \"Mother?\" \"How dare you, Olivia Lockhart Griffin! How dare you!\" Fresh tears welled in her eyes. Olivia set down her pen and gestured for her mother to take a seat-. Charlotte hesitated, then collapsed into the visitor\u0027s chair. She reached for her lace handkerchief, tucked in the sleeve of her blouse, and dabbed at the corners of her eyes. \"I\u0027m utterly ashamed that my own children would do anything so underhanded and deceitful. How could you do this to me—and to Ben? What\u0027s he ever done to you?\" Olivia sighed heavily. \"Mom, I can tell you\u0027re upset.\" \"Upset? You don\u0027t know the half of it!\" Olivia raised her hand. \"I don\u0027t blame you. I\u0027m sorry, but Will and I felt that in this day and age one can\u0027t be too careful.\" \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m capable of judging a man\u0027s character? Ben is decent and kind and...and honorable.\" \"I wanted to believe that too, but he has no family in the area.\" \"No family in the area?\" Charlotte repeated. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" \"Well, what brought him to Cedar Cove?\" Olivia briefly closed her eyes, as if she were embarrassed and ashamed, as well she should be. \"Will felt, and I agree, that we needed some verification of the things Ben told you.\" \"Like what?\" \"That he\u0027s who he says he is, for one thing.\" \"He is!\" Charlotte insisted. \"I know that now, but until I asked Roy to check into Ben\u0027s background, we only had his word for it that he\u0027s a retired admiral. He just seemed... too good to be true.\" Charlotte continued to dab at her eyes and sniffle as the anger was replaced by tears. \"I\u0027m so embarrassed. I love Ben.\" \"Oh, Mother...\" \"Don\u0027t you Oh, Mother me! I\u0027m old enough to know my own feelings and I refuse to listen to a lecture from you.\" Using the edge of the desk to support herself, she rose to her feet. \"Save those condescending little speeches for the courtroom.\" Having delivered her own insult—though minor in comparison—Charlotte started out of the room. \"Mom, please.\" Charlotte stopped in front of the closed door, her back to her daughter. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Olivia whispered. \"You\u0027re right. I should never have done this.\" \"It\u0027s a bit late for sorry, don\u0027t you think?\" \"Yes.\" Again Olivia sighed. \"I know how you feel about Ben.\" \"I sincerely doubt that, but go on.\" She turned to face Olivia now, her expression blank. \"His sons ren\u0027t having me investigated.\" Olivia let the comment slide. \"Ben\u0027s a companion and a friend and—\" Charlotte didn\u0027t know why she bothered. She shook her head, astonished by her own daughter\u0027s insensitivity. \"I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m hearing this from someone who was so recently married. Look at me, Olivia,\" she commanded, \"and listen well. I\u0027m in love. For the first time since your father died, I feel truly alive again. I wake up every morning with a sense of joy because I know that at some point during the day I\u0027ll be with Ben.\" Olivia closed her eyes again, as if gathering her thoughts. \"Mom, I understand what you\u0027re saying. It\u0027s the same with Jack and me.\" She opened her eyes, gazing straight at Charlotte. \"How would you feel if I\u0027d had him investigated?\" Olivia leaned forward and braced her hands on her desk. \"It wouldn\u0027t have mattered. I love Jack, and he\u0027s got nothing to hide from me.\" \"And you think Ben has?\" \"That\u0027s just it—I didn\u0027t know.\" \"And now you do?\" Olivia nodded. \"Roy mailed me the report last week. I sent off a copy to Will, telling him we can both rest assured that Ben Rhodes is everything he said he was.\" There was a knock at the door. Olivia checked her watch and frowned. \"Come in.\" To Charlotte\u0027s complete shock, Ben opened the door and stepped into the chamber. Both women stared at him, although neither seemed to know what to say. For her part, Charlotte was mortified. She wanted to apologize, to ask his forgiveness on her children\u0027s behalf, but her throat closed up at the sight of him. Olivia recovered first. \"Please come in, Ben,\" she said. \"I believe there\u0027s been a slight misunderstanding.\" \"That\u0027s what you\u0027re calling this?\" Charlotte cried. Olivia threw her mother a silencing look. \"Would you care to sit down?\" \"Unfortunately,\" Charlotte said, standing up and entwining her arm with Ben\u0027s, \"we have to be going.\" \"Now, Charlotte,\" Ben countered. \"I think it would be best if we talked this out.\" \"I agree,\" Olivia said quickly. She focused her attention on Ben. \"If I\u0027ve offended you, Ben, I apologize.\" \"If?\" Charlotte shook her head. She\u0027d always been so proud of Olivia, her daughter the judge. For the first time in longer than she could remember, she had the urge to send Olivia to her room without dinner. \"I love your mother, Olivia,\" Ben said boldly. \"I know you do, too. We have more in common than you realize.\" Olivia offered him a tentative smile. \"I can see that you\u0027re good company for each other.\" \"Olivia, you\u0027re not listening. Ben and I are in love!\u0027 Her daughter stared at her. \"What I think your mother is trying to tell you,\" Ben said, \"is that I\u0027ve asked Charlotte to be my wife and she\u0027s agreed.\" Olivia\u0027s gaze veered from Charlotte to Ben. \"You\u0027re asking my permission to marry my mother?\" \"No,\" Charlotte said, looking up at Ben. \"We\u0027re getting married with or without your approval.\" \"I see,\" Olivia managed. She sank back into her fancy leather chair and apparently had nothing more to say. Thirty-Two The alarm buzzed and Cecilia opened one eye, peering at the clock radio on her nightstand. The digital readout told her it was six o\u0027clock and time to get up. She groaned inwardly. It couldn\u0027t be six already. She felt as if she\u0027d just gotten to sleep. It\u0027d been like this when she was pregnant with Allison, too. She\u0027d felt as if she could\u0027ve slept for days at a time. What made it worse now was that Ian didn\u0027t go on duty until the afternoon, so she was the only one who had to get up this early. The minute she lifted her head from the pillow waves of nausea battered her. Moaning, she laid her head down again and closed her eyes, praying this would pass. Bolting up, covering her mouth, she raced into the bathroom just in time to empty her stomach into the toilet bowl. Still gagging, she closed her eyes again, hoping the worst of it was over. Blindly she reached for a washcloth draped over the edge of the sink. \"I\u0027ll get that for you.\" Ian rinsed the cloth, wrung it out then handed it to Cecilia. She patted the cool cloth against her face, straightened and tried to smile. \"Good morning,\" her husband said softly. \"Hi,\" she managed to respond as she wiped her mouth. \"Were you sick like this with Allison, too?\" Cecilia nodded. It was the first time he\u0027d asked. They hadn\u0027t been married during the initial months of her pregnancy, and she\u0027d never mentioned her problems with morning sickness. By the time they were married, the nausea had passed. \"Was it this bad?\" She nodded again. \"Every morning. Until my third month.\" Ian sank onto the edge of the bathtub. \"Is there anything I can do?\" He sounded almost guilty, as if he were personally responsible for her discomfort. Cecilia moved to his side. \"Love me,\" she whispered. Their relationship had been so strained since he\u0027d learned about the pregnancy, and even before, when he knew she wanted to get pregnant. He was trying to accept this baby, but he treated her with a kind of wariness, as though he was afraid to touch her. \"I do love you,\" Ian said. She turned away, and Ian put his arms around her and touched his forehead against her back. \"You never told me, you know?\" he protested. \"Never told you I was so sick every morning with Allison?\" Cecilia asked. \"Is that what you mean?\" She pressed her hand over his and moved his palm to her flat stomach and held it there. \"Would it have made any difference if you\u0027d known?\" \"I hear you every morning,\" he whispered. \"You run in here and heave your guts out.\" \"The doctor says I should eat a soda cracker when I first wake up.\" He kissed her neck, his lips lingering for a moment. \u0027Then why don\u0027t you?\" \"No time. I open my eyes and it\u0027s all I can do to make it to the bathroom.\" \u0027They can\u0027t give you a drug?\" \"I won\u0027t take anything.\" She had with Allison, and although the physicians had repeatedly assured her that Allison\u0027s heart defect had nothing to do with the pills she\u0027d taken for morning sickness, Cecilia couldn\u0027t completely believe it. True or not, she wasn\u0027t taking any chances with this pregnancy. Ian sighed as if he\u0027d give anything for her not to be pregnant. It broke her heart, but she refused to show her pain. She knew that when the baby came, Ian would love his son or daughter with the same intensity that he already loved Allison. He wouldn\u0027t be able to stop himself. Until then she\u0027d be patient. \"Stay home today,\" he urged. \"And waste a sick day?\" She couldn\u0027t do that. In the months to come she might need them. Besides, with Ian leaving for work in a few hours, it didn\u0027t make sense. \"Take a vacation day then.\" \"Why?\" She turned to face him. \"Because I can\u0027t stand the thought of you going to work sick.\" Little did he know that she had to pull off the road nearly every morning to vomit. \"I go to work sick most days.\" Today wouldn\u0027t be any different. \"Mr. Cox relies on me, and besides, Allison is coming by this afternoon.\" Ian stiffened. \"Mr. Cox\u0027s teenage daughter,\" Cecilia reminded him. \"I know who you meant.\" \"She\u0027s a good kid, and now that her parents are back together, she\u0027s doing really well in school.\" Ian\u0027s shoulders rose as he expelled a breath. \"I wonder if the Coxes knew the hell their daughter would put them through when they decided to have a baby.\" Despite her upset stomach, Cecilia laughed and stroked her husband\u0027s thick hair. \"Babies don\u0027t come with guarantees. They grow up and turn into teenagers. When the time comes, we\u0027ll deal with it.\" Bending forward she kissed him on the lips. \"I\u0027m sorry, honey, but I have to get ready for work.\" He grumbled for form\u0027s sake, then went back to bed while she dressed. Cecilia put on her makeup and packed a lunch, although the sight of food made her stomach lurch. But by noon she\u0027d be fine and her appetite would return and she\u0027d need that lunch. Ian appeared to be sound asleep when she left the duplex. Munching on soda crackers as she drove, Cecilia made it all the way to the office without a single emergency stop. This was progress. According to the navy doctor, her due date was the first week of May. May fifth. Allison had been born in June. Cecilia had gone into labor on a beautiful summer afternoon, but the perfection of the day hadn\u0027t augured a happy event. Being alone had been terrifying, even more so after her baby\u0027s birth. Forcefully Cecilia turned her thoughts away from her first pregnancy. This time everything would be different. This time Ian would be with her and their baby would be born healthy.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-31.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) Dear Reader, I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
