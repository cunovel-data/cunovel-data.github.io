He walked over to Valerie, who ran the reception desk, and pulled his wallet out of his rear pocket.\n \"Hi, Daddy,\" Jolene called out.\n His expression softened as he turned to face his daughter. \"All right, all right, ladies.\" he said and shook his head, looking chagrined. \"You talked me into it. I signed up for the Dog and Bachelor Auction.\"\n \"You did?\" Terri was so excited she nearly leaped up from her table.\n \"Great,\" Jeannie cried, equally thrilled.\n Bruce glanced at Rachel, obviously anticipating her reaction. She nodded, letting him know she approved, but she hoped he wouldn\u0027t be disappointed when she didn\u0027t bid on him.\n Eighteen\n During the summer months, Charlotte\u0027s favorite night of the week was Thursday. For a number of years now, the Chamber of Commerce had sponsored Concerts on the Cove, bringing in a variety of free entertainment, from pop groups to jazz quartets. Tonight was an Irish band, with fiddles and one of those Celtic drums—Charlotte couldn\u0027t remember what they were called. The concerts brought almost the entire town together once a week, as young and old alike crowded the small waterfront park, enjoying the festive atmosphere.\n Before he came by to collect her, Ben had bought their dinner, teriyaki chicken and rice from her favorite take-out restaurant. Walking hand in hand, he carried their folding chairs, while she held on to their food.\n \"Oh, good. We have our spot,\" she said, looking at the place under the mountain ash where they usually sat. Some couples shared a song or a favorite movie; Charlotte and Ben had their own patch of lawn in WaterfrontPark.\n Ben was so thoughtful and considerate toward her, Charlotte mused as he set up the chairs and insisted she sit down.\n And she loved his old-fashioned manners—the way he held doors and stood when she entered a room. The world didn\u0027t have much time or interest in those niceties anymore, but Charlotte was of a generation that still appreciated them.\n They settled in their spot. It was still early, but they always arrived a good hour before the concert began in order to secure their special place.\n \"Oh, look,\" she said with the take-out container balanced on her lap. \"There\u0027s Corrie McAfee. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen her at any of the concerts before.\"\n Corrie glanced around as if she wasn\u0027t sure where to go.\n \"Corrie,\" Charlotte said, waving her arm. \"Over here.\"\n Corrie headed eagerly in Charlotte\u0027s direction. \"Hello, Mrs. Jefferson.\"\n \"Call me Charlotte. You know my friend Ben Rhodes, don\u0027t you?\"\n Although he had his meal in his lap, Ben stood. Charlotte wouldn\u0027t have expected anything less.\n \"This is your first time here, isn\u0027t it?\" Charlotte asked. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll enjoy it.\" She wanted Corrie to know she was welcome. She hadn\u0027t had much opportunity to meet the McAfees. They were still considered new to the community, although they\u0027d lived in Cedar Cove for several years. As a private investigator, Roy had probably learned more about this town and its people than he\u0027d ever cared to know. It was important, Charlotte felt, to bring the couple into the fold.\n Corrie gestured toward the parking lot. \"I finally managed to talk Roy into coming down. He\u0027s parking the car.\"\n \"Sit here with us.\" Charlotte invited. \"I always bring an extra blanket. It sometimes gets a bit cool in the evenings, but you and Roy would be welcome to sit on it.\"\n \"Oh, Roy\u0027s bringing a couple of chairs.\"\n \"Look, there\u0027s Grace Sherman,\" Charlotte said, waving enthusiastically at the local librarian. \"She has Buttercup with her. That is such a well-behaved dog,\"\n Grace waved back and continued down the waterfront at a brisk pace, the golden retriever trotting dutifully beside her.\n Charlotte was proud of having brought Buttercup into Grace\u0027s life. Three years ago, a good friend had moved into a retirement center and consequently needed a new home for her pet. Grace had immediately popped into Charlotte\u0027s mind. That was shortly after Dan Sherman had turned up missing, and Charlotte understood how lost and lonely her daughter\u0027s friend felt.\n Roy appeared, walking along the waterfront with two folding chairs, one under each arm. He nodded when he saw Corrie.\n \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s a happy camper about all this,\" Corrie said under her breath. \"I\u0027m the one who\u0027s fond of Irish music.\"\n Roy walked across the soft green grass toward them. \"Hello, Charlotte, Ben,\" Roy muttered as he set up the chairs.\n Charlotte was surprised to see what a big man Roy was. She\u0027d seen him around town any number of times, but always at a distance and hadn\u0027t noticed how tall he was.\n Ben stood again and the two men exchanged handshakes. \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve met,\" Ben said. \"Ben Rhodes.\"\n After they chatted for a few moments, Roy settled next to his wife. They put their heads together, whispering for a moment, and then Roy excused himself.\n \"We were going to eat after the concert,\" Corrie explained, \"but that chicken looks so good, Roy decided to walk across the street and pick up dinner now.\"\n \"The teriyaki is our favorite,\" Charlotte told her. \"This is way more than I can eat. Ben and I should probably share an order but the leftovers are always so delicious the next day.\"\n \"Our daughter Linnette\u0027s favorite meal is teriyaki chicken,\" Corrie added conversationally. \"Speaking of Linnette,\" she began. She fumbled nervously with her hands, and then laughed. \"That wasn\u0027t a very good transition, was it?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t realize you had a daughter,\" Charlotte said. She didn\u0027t know the McAfees well enough to know about their children.\n \"Actually, I\u0027ve been looking for a chance to talk to both of you about Linnette,\" Corrie confessed. \"She recently graduated as a physician\u0027s assistant. It was an arduous program, but Linnette feels strongly about bringing medical professionals to small towns.\"\n Charlotte sat up straighter at this bit of news. \"I suppose you\u0027ve heard how hard Ben and I have worked to get a medical facility built in Cedar Cove.\"\n Corrie nodded. \"That\u0027s what I wanted to discuss. Do you have any news about what\u0027s happening with that?\"\n For the last two months, Charlotte and Ben had shown up for every single council meeting. They sat in the front row, as if to say they weren\u0027t going silently into that long, dark night. For her part, Charlotte had decided she\u0027d keel over dead before she gave up her efforts to get a medical clinic in Cedar Cove.\n \"I don\u0027t know what to tell you,\" she murmured. \"So far, there\u0027s been no real progress. Just a lot of talk.\"\n Ben leaned forward. \"The argument is that even if the council were to fund a clinic, the town can\u0027t afford personnel.\"\n \"Linnette applied for a job in Montana, and I hate the thought of our daughter living so far from home.\" Corrie waved to someone in the distance; the park was fast filling up. \"I\u0027d hoped something might turn up here in Cedar Cove. I miss my daughter and she\u0027s only a ferry ride away now. I can\u0027t imagine what it\u0027ll be like when she\u0027s hundreds of miles from home.\"\n \"A physician\u0027s assistant,\" Charlotte repeated. \"Maybe there is something we can do.\"\n \"What?\" Ben asked, turning to Charlotte.\n Charlotte gently patted his knee. \"Leave that to me.\"\n Olivia and Jack arrived just then, and Charlotte stood and waved them over. Seeing their friends, family and neighbors was what made these summertime concerts so much fun. Her daughter waved back, but Charlotte noticed that Olivia and Jack seemed to be having a discussion before they made their way through the crowd to join her.\n \"There\u0027s plenty of room here with Ben and me,\" Charlotte told them. She moved her chair closer to Ben\u0027s. Although she\u0027d only taken a few bites of her dinner, she\u0027d much rather visit than eat. Closing the container, she returned it to the plastic bag.\n \"Hello, Corrie,\" Olivia said.\n To Charlotte\u0027s ears, her daughter sounded stressed, although she had no idea why that would be. This was a night for relaxing, for laughter and singing and catching up with friends.\n Olivia glanced at Ben and greeted him, but her tone was remote, as if she hadn\u0027t decided what to think of her mother\u0027s friend.\n Her daughter\u0027s attitude troubled Charlotte, and she decided to talk to Olivia about it later, when they had a private moment.\n \"Sit down, sit down,\" she instructed Olivia. \"Jack, you\u0027re looking fit these days.\"\n He patted his stomach. \"I could lose a few pounds, according to Olivia.\"\n Charlotte smiled. So that was the reason her daughter had asked her to recommend a healthy-eating cookbook. Charlotte had bought them shortly after her cancer treatments and tried some of the recipes. They weren\u0027t bad, but over time she\u0027d gradually reverted to eating the way she always had. Old habits were difficult to break.\n \"You know Corrie McAfee, don\u0027t you?\" Charlotte said, wanting to make sure Olivia made Corrie feel welcome. \"This is the McAfees\u0027 first time at Concerts on the Cove.\"\n Olivia nodded to Corrie. \"Good to see you again.\"\n \"You too,\" Corrie said.\n The two women exchanged long looks. Charlotte didn\u0027t know what that was about, either. Surely her daughter and the wife of the local P.I. couldn\u0027t possibly be colluding about anything.\n \"Corrie and I were just talking about a health clinic here in Cedar Cove,\" Charlotte continued, hoping to include Olivia in the conversation. \"The McAfees\u0027 daughter is a physician\u0027s assistant, and Corrie was just saying how nice it would be if she worked in this area.\"\n Olivia nodded absently.\n \"A health clinic is important, Olivia,\" Charlotte said, her voice a little sharper than usual.\n \"I agree,\" she muttered, frowning.\n \"I suppose you think a bigger jail is more of a priority.\"\n \"We could use a larger jail, but—\"\n \"You can\u0027t be serious!\" Charlotte was aghast that her daughter would think additional jail cells should take precedence over the health concerns of their community.\n \"We do need a bigger jail,\" Jack concurred. \"In fact I just wrote an article this afternoon about the problems with transporting local offenders to jails in YakimaCounty. But, to my way of thinking, we need a medical facility more.\"\n Olivia nodded once again, silently agreeing with her husband.\n Her daughter\u0027s lack of verbal support for her cause hurt Charlotte. Olivia was in a position to do much more and she hadn\u0027t, because it wasn\u0027t important enough to her.\n As if he understood her disappointment in Olivia, Ben reached for her hand and gave her fingers a gentle squeeze. She swallowed hard and managed a smile as she turned to this man she\u0027d come to love so late in life.\n Nineteen\n It was a perfect day for gardening, Peggy thought—sunny but not hot, with a comfortable breeze and an almost cloudless sky.\n She\u0027d decided to visit the local nursery, inviting Hannah to join her. Now Peggy loaded a thirty-pound bag of fertilizer into the large garden cart, while Hannah wandered through the aisles of perennials.\n \"Let me do that,\" the young woman insisted, hurrying to her side. \"I came with you because I wanted to help.\"\n Peggy always enjoyed her trips to the nursery, although she rarely left without filling up the minivan. Her raspberries and blueberries could do with fertilizer. She was out of slug bait, too. Her yard was lovely, with the rhododendrons and azaleas in bloom. The lilacs were coming out, too, and she had both the purple and white varieties along the side of the house. Her small rose garden was prospering, and so was her expanding herb garden. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-18.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: \n 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) \n Dear Reader, \n I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
