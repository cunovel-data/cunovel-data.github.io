{"id":67112,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"He hesitated, then agreed with a shrug. \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"I heard Linnette McAfee\u0027s been hired to work at the clinic.\" It was an obvious change of topic, but he accepted it readily enough and she sighed with relief.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I understand.\"\\n\\n \"Since Linnette\u0027s moving to town, maybe she\u0027ll have a chance to get to know Cal.\" She gestured vaguely. \"More than she could on just a dinner date.\"\\n\\n \"Cal\u0027s a good man,\" Cliff said casually. \"I think getting out more will do him a world of good.\"\\n\\n \"I like him,\" Grace said although her contact with Cliff\u0027s trainer had been limited to a few short conversations. His shyness and stuttering made communication difficult. Instinctively, she wanted to finish his sentences, to spare him the embarrassment of stammering. But on honest reflection, she supposed her impulse to help had as much to do with her own discomfort as with any perceptions of his.\\n\\n \"He likes you, too.\"\\n\\n Instantly Grace\u0027s heart lightened.\\n\\n The waitress approached the table with their first course, shrimp bisque for Grace and Caesar salad for Cliff.\\n\\n \"How are Maryellen and Jon?\" he asked as he set down his wineglass.\\n\\n \"Happy and deeply in love.\" In that instant, Grace wished she could withdraw the words. Talking about love was painful; under different circumstances, those words could have referred to them. \"They hope to have another child,\" she said after a pause.\\n\\n \"What about Kelly and Paul?\"\\n\\n Grace sighed. \"Kelly still isn\u0027t pregnant and she\u0027s starting to get worried.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure there\u0027s no cause for concern.\"\\n\\n Grace agreed, and they lapsed into silence again.\\n\\n The waitress returned to collect their first-course dishes and bring their entrees. She also refilled their wine. Grace took her first taste of sole topped with a creamy shrimp sauce, and Cliff cut into his prime rib. They both made enthusiastic noises about the excellence of the food.\\n\\n By the time they\u0027d finished their meals, Grace accepted that nothing she said or did had the power to reach Cliff. So she stopped trying. There seemed little point in more small talk about the town or doings at the library or plans for his ranch; that left them with nothing much to say.\\n\\n After dinner, Grace drove home, even more lonely and depressed. It was hard not to weep and to berate herself—and humbling to admit she\u0027d failed yet again. Olivia and the girls had paid that money for one reason and one reason only. They\u0027d hoped, as Grace had, that Cliff would have a change of heart. He hadn\u0027t.\\n\\n The phone rang at eight o\u0027clock on Saturday morning. Grace was feeding her animals. Automatically she scooped up the receiver and held it to her ear while she doled out the dog and cat food.\\n\\n \"Well?\" Olivia demanded. \"How\u0027d it go?\"\\n\\n Grace resisted the urge to break into tears. \"We had a very nice dinner, but that\u0027s it.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be so sure.\"\\n\\n \"Olivia,\" Grace said with an exaggerated sigh. \"I was there. I might as well have had dinner with a statue.\" She switched the phone to her other ear. \"The closest I got to seeing the old Cliff was when he showed me a picture of Lisa and her little girl.\"\\n\\n \"Give him time.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Grace was surprised by the strength of her conviction. \"I\u0027m not going to grovel. I made a mistake. I\u0027m sorry. If Cliff Harding can\u0027t get past that, then it\u0027s his problem, not mine.\"\\n\\n Olivia was silent for a long moment. \"Grace is that really you?\" she finally asked.\\n\\n \"Of course it\u0027s me.\"\\n\\n \"You sound so...emotionally healthy.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you approve.\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" Olivia assured her.\\n\\n Obviously Cliff had chosen to get on with his life— minus Grace. She would let him and at the same time get on with hers.\\n\\n With a renewed sense of vigor, she weeded and watered her small garden.\\n\\n At noon, a florist\u0027s delivery van parked outside her house. Pulling off her garden gloves, Grace walked around front, wondering if the driver had mistaken the address.\\n\\n \"Ms. Grace Sherman?\" The deliveryman held a beautiful bouquet of roses, carnations and irises in a variety of pastel shades.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Grace vaguely recognized the young man but couldn\u0027t remember his name.\\n\\n \"These are for you.\" He handed her the vase, turned and left.\\n\\n Grace carried the arrangement into the house and removed the card. As she read the message, tears clouded her eyes. Life has a funny way of hitting you between the eyes, doesn\u0027t it? Thank you for dinner. Cliff.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t know what he meant but she felt this must be a good sign.\\n\\n Thirty-One\\n\\n Ben pushed the grocery cart down the produce aisle while Charlotte sorted through the celery. The grocer tended to put the older bunches in front.\\n\\n \"Do you want me to pick up a few bananas?\" Ben asked.\\n\\n \"Please.\" Bananas were the perfect fruit for people their age, in Charlotte\u0027s view.\\n\\n Ben added a small bunch to their cart. He was so helpful in so many ways. Clyde hadn\u0027t been the kind of husband who enjoyed shopping, but Ben was more than patient about doing errands. He seemed to enjoy spending time with her. If she had a hair appointment, he drove her there and either waited in the salon or strolled through the mall. After all these years on her own, such open affection—such romantic gestures—were foreign to her. When she was with Ben she felt...treasured. True, his attention had taken a bit of adjustment on her part, since she was so used to her own company. Charlotte slowly pushed the cart ahead, watching as Ben struck up a conversation with the produce manager.\\n\\n \"Charlotte!\"\\n\\n Hearing her name, Charlotte turned to find her son-in-law strolling toward her, wearing a big grin.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell me Olivia\u0027s got you doing the shopping,\" Charlotte said.\\n\\n Jack chuckled and shook his head. \"I came to pick up a few things she refuses to buy. Whoever heard of a house without potato chips and pretzels? Olivia said if I was going to eat fat-laden carbohydrates, I\u0027d have to buy them myself. So here I am.\" He looked over his shoulder, as if he half expected his wife to follow him inside and criticize his food choices. \"I don\u0027t suppose you know where they keep the microwave popcorn, do you?\"\\n\\n \"Aisle five,\" Charlotte said. \"I like the extra-butter kind myself.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m with you,\" Jack muttered. \"I don\u0027t know what it is with Olivia these days.\"\\n\\n \"How do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"First she\u0027s on this low-fat kick. Okay, I admit I could lose a few pounds, but I looked like this when she married me and it was good enough for her then.\"\\n\\n Charlotte knew her daughter\u0027s fitness plan had caused arguments between them, but she\u0027d assumed things were better now. Olivia hadn\u0027t complained in weeks.\\n\\n \"Then there\u0027s this thing with Ben,\" he added, scowling. \"It\u0027s ridiculous.\"\\n\\n Charlotte stared at him, certain she\u0027d misunderstood. \"What thing with Ben?\" she demanded. Thankfully Ben was still busy talking.\\n\\n Jack looked like a man who\u0027d inadvertently stumbled into a swampful of alligators. \"Ah...that was a slip of the tongue. Forget it.\"\\n\\n \"I most certainly will not forget it,\" Charlotte slammed a bunch of celery into her cart. \"You\u0027d better tell me everything!\u0027\\n\\n \"Ah...\" Jack faltered. \"I, uh...\" Finally he gave a resigned sigh. \"Olivia\u0027s having Roy do a background check on him,\" he said grimly.\\n\\n \"What?\" Charlotte felt her blood pressure rise.\\n\\n \"Charlotte?\" Ben asked, joining her. He looked at Jack. \"Is there a problem?\"\\n\\n \"None whatsoever,\" Charlotte snapped. She smiled at Ben, who\u0027d been nothing but a gentleman from the moment they met. Now her own daughter had gone behind her back and was having the man she loved investigated. Evidently Olivia had no faith in her intelligence or her judgment. Anyone who spent time with Ben would know he was the gentlest, sweetest, most wonderful man on earth. Olivia had met him many times. How could she do this? Why? The outrage turned to pain and her eyes filled with tears.\\n\\n \"I...I can\u0027t believe Olivia would do something like this,\" she said, trying to hide the hurt her daughter had caused her. Sniffling, she turned away.\\n\\n Ben was at her side immediately. He slid his arm around her protectively. \"What\u0027s going on here, Charlotte?\"\\n\\n Charlotte shouldn\u0027t have done it, but she told him. \"Olivia\u0027s having you investigated. I don\u0027t know why she\u0027d do such a thing, but apparently she has. Jack just let it slip....\"\\n\\n Ben\u0027s mouth thinned with irritation. \"Rest assured there\u0027s nothing to find.\"\\n\\n \"Damn my big mouth,\" Jack muttered. \"It isn\u0027t all Olivia, you know.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Charlotte was rigid with anger now.\\n\\n \"Maybe I should just pay for these potato chips and be on my way,\" Jack suggested, obviously uncomfortable.\\n\\n \"Like hell!\"\\n\\n Ben\u0027s eyes widened. Charlotte was not a woman who used that kind of language. In fact, she was shocked herself. But there were times when nothing less than a swearword would do. \"You tell me the whole story and I mean now, Jack Griffin.\"\\n\\n Jack shifted his weight from one foot to the other. \"Olivia\u0027s going to kill me for this.\"\\n\\n \"Why? She\u0027s guiltier than you are.\"\\n\\n Jack shrugged. \"You don\u0027t know Olivia the way I do.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s my daughter—if I don\u0027t end up disowning her over this.\" Charlotte had trouble accepting what her daughter had done. \"Who put her up to it?\" She leaned forward and glared fiercely at her son-in-law. \"You, Jack? Was it you?\"\\n\\n He shook his head, raising his hand in a gesture of surrender. \"Not me. Will.\"\\n\\n This was even worse than she could\u0027ve imagined. \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding.\"\\n\\n Jack cast Ben an apologetic look.\\n\\n That just made Charlotte angrier. \"How dare he?\" she sputtered.\\n\\n \"Now, Charlotte,\" Ben said in a soothing voice. \"Let\u0027s talk about this calmly.\"\\n\\n But Charlotte was in no mood to be mollified. \"You tell my daughter that I\u0027m in love with Ben Rhodes and I have every intention of marrying him.\"\\n\\n Head down, Jack nodded like a repentant child.\\n\\n \"On second thought, I\u0027ll tell her myself.\"\\n\\n Jack raised his index finger. \"When you do speak to Olivia, I\u0027d appreciate if you gave me a few minutes\u0027 notice first.\"\\n\\n Ben chuckled, but Charlotte found nothing humorous in the situation. \"Then consider yourself warned.\"\\n\\n Jack clearly felt terrible, but she didn\u0027t blame him for her daughter\u0027s actions. No, she knew exactly who was responsible for this... this insult.\\n\\n Despite his protest, Charlotte left Ben to deal with the groceries while she marched over to the courthouse. It was a good three-block walk and uphill at that, but Charlotte\u0027s indignation drove her all three of those blocks without a single pause. By the time she got there, however, she was winded. Charlotte leaned against one of the courthouse pillars and placed her hand over her pounding heart, taking slow, deep breaths.\\n\\n Her expression must have conveyed her mood because no one stopped her or delayed her with conversation. After clearing security, she plowed through the crowded hallway to her daughter\u0027s courtroom. She shoved open the door decisively and...\\n\\n Wouldn\u0027t you know it, the room was empty. All the better. Charlotte didn\u0027t need any witnesses to this confrontation. She went directly to Olivia\u0027s chambers. The mahogany door was closed; she knocked once and opened it without waiting for permission. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-30.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) \\n Dear Reader, \\n I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
