I was supposedly in danger then, right?\"\\n\\n Sheriff Davis exchanged a concerned look with Peggy. \"I understand what you\u0027re saying, but we didn\u0027t know then what we know now.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not running! I spent half my life running, and I won\u0027t do it again. If somebody wants me dead, then so be it.\"\\n\\n Peggy gasped.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, honey,\" her husband said, stretching his arm across the table to clasp her fingers with his. \"I refuse to live like that, looking over my shoulder all the time.\"\\n\\n \"Then perhaps you could compromise,\" Davis said. \"There\u0027s no need to invite someone into your home who might want to harm you.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" Bob leaned closer, his stomach pressed against the rounded edge of the pinewood table. Peggy realized that despite his defiant words he was afraid. His body language revealed what he was unwilling to admit.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know how many reservations you have for the B and B, but I\u0027d advise you to not take any more.\"\\n\\n \"We can easily cancel the ones we have,\" Peggy murmured. Any number of businesses in town would welcome the additional bookings.\\n\\n Bob directed his gaze at Peggy. \"Would that make you more comfortable?\"\\n\\n She swallowed and nodded.\\n\\n Bob continued to look unsure, as if even this one concession was more than he felt inclined to make.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been worried ever since Jack and Olivia\u0027s wedding,\" she whispered.\\n\\n A week earlier, Bob had stood up as Jack Griffin\u0027s best man. That was just a day or two before they\u0027d learned Max Russell had been murdered.\\n\\n \"All right.\" Bob\u0027s voice was heavy with reluctance. \"We\u0027ll cancel the reservations.\"\\n\\n \"No guests,\" Peggy said.\\n\\n \"No guests,\" he confirmed, \"until this matter is settled once and for all.\"\\n\\n This was going to hurt financially, but it didn\u0027t matter. What did matter was having the reassurance that her husband was safe.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do what I can to solve this quickly,\" Troy promised them.\\n\\n Peggy could only wonder how long that would take.\\n\\n Two\\n\\n Cecilia Randall stood on the navy pier and watched the aircraft carrier George Washington sail into SinclairInlet. After six months serving in the Persian Gulf, her husband, Ian, was finally home. Cecilia had often heard people talk about hearts swelling and dismissed the expression as exaggerated, sentimental. Now she knew what it meant, how it felt. Her heart swelled with love, pride and patriotism as the massive ship headed toward Bremerton.\\n\\n The other navy wives and hordes of friends and family crowded the pier. Colorful banners waved in the wind, along with Welcome Home signs. News helicopters from the Seattle television stations circled the area, taping the event for the five-o\u0027clock broadcast. The joy and excitement around her was infectious, despite the dreary, cloudy day. Even the lead-gray skies and the threat of imminent rain didn\u0027t dampen Cecilia\u0027s mood. A band played in the background, and the American flag rippled in the breeze. It could have been a Norman Rockwell painting.\\n\\n Cecilia\u0027s dearest friends, two other navy wives, Cathy Lackey and Carol Greendale, stood with her, each holding a toddler against her hip while madly waving. Cecilia hoped that before long she\u0027d be a mother again herself.\\n\\n \"I think I see Andrew,\" Cathy cried. She screeched with happiness and waved one arm wildly above her head. Then she pointed his daddy out to her young son.\\n\\n Three thousand sailors, dressed in white navy uniforms, stood along the rail, feet apart, hands behind their backs, as they lined the perimeter of the flight deck. At this distance it was impossible for Cecilia to find Ian. The wind whipped at her face and she shouted and waved. Perhaps Ian would see her.\\n\\n \"Take Amanda,\" Carol said, heaving her three-year-old daughter toward Cecilia.\\n\\n She gladly held the toddler. There\u0027d been a time when even looking at this little girl brought her pain. Allison, Ian\u0027s and her baby daughter, was born the same week as Amanda. Had she lived, Allison, too, would\u0027ve been three years old. But she\u0027d died after clinging to life for only a few days. Her death had ripped the marriage apart. If not for a wise family court judge who ignored convention and denied their divorce, they might have ended up like so many other sad marriage statistics.\\n\\n \"Ian, over here,\" Cecilia shouted, as she thrust one arm high above her head. \"Do you see your daddy?\" she asked Amanda.\\n\\n The little girl\u0027s arms were tight around Cecilia\u0027s neck, and she buried her face in Cecilia\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s Daddy, there\u0027s Daddy,\" Carol said, pointing to the aircraft carrier.\\n\\n Amanda looked up then, smiling, and Carol reached for her daughter again.\\n\\n An eternity passed before the gangplank was lowered and the sailors disembarked, carrying their duffel bags. Soon there were reunions everywhere. Cathy spotted Andrew and ran toward her husband, weeping with happiness.\\n\\n Cecilia searched frantically for Ian. Then she saw him, tall and fit and tan, his dark hair visible beneath his white Navy cap. The breath left her lungs at the sight of him and she burst into tears of joy.\\n\\n Not a minute later, Cecilia was caught up in her husband\u0027s arms. They clung to each other, tears still clouding her eyes as Ian brought his mouth to hers.\\n\\n Their kiss was slow, sensual and filled with six months of longing and need. By the time they\u0027d finished, Cecilia was weak and breathless. Ian was home; her world was complete once again. The universe could have dissolved around her and she wouldn\u0027t have cared.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve missed you like crazy,\" she whispered, holding on to him, her fingers massaging the nape of his neck. There was so much to say, so much that was in her heart. None of it mattered right then, however. All she cared about was the feel of Ian\u0027s arms around her and the knowledge that he was home and safe and hers, if only on loan from the United States Navy.\\n\\n \"Oh, sweetheart, this has been the longest six months of my life.\" He continued to hold her tight against him. Cecilia closed her eyes and savored this moment she\u0027d been waiting for.\\n\\n Ian had three days of shore leave and Cecilia planned to make full use of every one of them. The days—and the nights. His return couldn\u0027t have been better planned. As far as she could tell, these next few days were her fertile period.\\n\\n With his duffel bag over his shoulder, Ian reached for her hand as they walked toward the parking area. Apparently she still wasn\u0027t close enough to suit him because he wrapped his arm around her waist and drew her to his side. He smiled and his love washed over her like...like warm sunshine. That was all she could compare it to, the life-giving warmth so absent today. A light drizzle had begun and they walked a little faster, still gazing at each other.\\n\\n \"I love you,\" she mouthed.\\n\\n \"I can hardly wait to show you how much I love you.\" Then, as if the question had only now occurred to him, he asked, \"You don\u0027t have to go back to work, do you?\"\\n\\n She toyed with the idea of letting him worry, but couldn\u0027t make herself do it. \"As a matter of fact, Mr. Cox gave me all three days off.\" She handed Ian the car keys, and he promptly unlocked their vehicle.\\n\\n \"I like your boss more and more.\"\\n\\n Cecilia did, too, especially now that Mr. and Mrs. Cox had remarried. The office became a much more relaxed place once the couple reunited. But it wasn\u0027t the Coxes on Cecilia\u0027s mind as Ian drove to their duplex. They met each other\u0027s eyes frequently but didn\u0027t speak much. Ten minutes later they were home.\\n\\n \"Did you bring back everything I sent you?\" Cecilia asked in a husky voice when Ian parked in their assigned spot. They\u0027d moved into military housing just before his most recent deployment, when a unit became available.\\n\\n \"That was very sadistic of you, wife,\" Ian said, his eyebrows drawing together.\\n\\n Had she not known him so well, Cecilia might think he hadn\u0027t been amused by her small prank. The gleam in his eyes told her otherwise. For each of the last three weeks before he was due home, Cecilia had sent him one piece of a sheer negligee outfit. With the last piece, she\u0027d included a note that promised she\u0027d wear it for him when he got back. In his last e-mail to her, she could almost hear him panting.\\n\\n \"I hope you realize you\u0027ve created a monster with that little trick of yours.\"\\n\\n \"A monster I\u0027m eager to tame,\" she whispered, leaning over to kiss him.\\n\\n \"Oh, honey...\" He broke off the kiss. \"Let\u0027s get inside— fast.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, aye,\" she said dreamily, saluting him.\\n\\n Ian slid out the driver\u0027s side and dashed around the front of the car. He opened the passenger door, helped her out and grabbed his duffel bag from the back. Giggling with excitement, they ran through the light rain toward their duplex. Ian was all thumbs as he struggled to unlock their door.\\n\\n Cecilia had cleaned the place until it sparkled. The sheets on their bed were fresh and turned down, the bedroom shades drawn. After six months of separation she\u0027d known they wouldn\u0027t want to wait to make love.\\n\\n As soon as they got inside, Ian dropped his duffel and reached out for her. Cecilia came willingly, throwing her arms around his neck. He hoisted her up and headed directly for the bedroom. The second they cleared the door, Ian kissed her again, his mouth open and moist, moving urgently against hers.\\n\\n He released her and immediately started undressing.\\n\\n \"You want me to put on that black nightie for you?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Next time,\" Ian said, his breathing shallow as he sat on the bed and quickly removed his shoes.\\n\\n \"One more thing...\"\\n\\n He gave her a questioning glance.\\n\\n She knelt behind him on the bed and rested her chin on his bare shoulder. \"I think there\u0027s something you should know.\"\\n\\n \"It can\u0027t wait?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it could, but I figure this is something you might want to know.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" he growled, turning toward her. He grabbed her around the waist, and his dark eyes bore into hers.\\n\\n Cecilia smiled at her husband, smoothing her hands down his muscular shoulders, loving the feel of him. \"I\u0027m thinking this afternoon would be a wonderful time to make a baby.\"\\n\\n Ian\u0027s eyes flared briefly. \"I thought you were on the pill.\"\\n\\n Her smile broadened as she slowly shook her head. \"Not anymore. I tossed them into the garbage six months ago.\"\\n\\n He frowned.\\n\\n \"With you at sea, there wasn\u0027t any need for me to be on birth control. Besides—\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t start again when you knew I was coming home?\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\"\\n\\n \"But—but you knew when I was due back.\"\\n\\n \"I did.. .and I\u0027ve been greatly anticipating your homecoming,\" she purred.\\n\\n \"But, sweetheart, you never said a word! I don\u0027t have anything to protect you from pregnancy.\"\\n\\n \"Who says I want protection? What I want, sailor man,\" she whispered, \"is a baby.\"\\n\\n Ian went completely still.\\n\\n \"Ian?\"\\n\\n Her husband straightened, sitting on the side of the bed with his back to her. \"Don\u0027t you think this is something we should\u0027ve discussed first?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re...we\u0027re discussing it now.\"\\n\\n \"At the last possible moment.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want a baby?\"\\n\\n Ian stood then and faced her. His shoulders were bare and his pants half unzipped. He rubbed his hand over his eyes as if her question had overwhelmed him. \"I do want children, but not yet.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-2.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) \\n Dear Reader, \\n I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
