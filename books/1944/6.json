{"id":67088,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Her sense of loneliness was accentuated even more now that Olivia had remarried. Grace was happy for her dearest friend and yet she was afraid that Olivia wouldn\u0027t have as much time for her anymore. She was ashamed of her Internet lapse with Olivia\u0027s brother, and felt somewhat distanced from Olivia as a result. \"Well, Buttercup,\" Grace murmured as the dog came back inside. \"Shall we see what\u0027s on the agenda for today?\" She poured herself a cup of coffee while Buttercup lapped water from her bowl. A fund-raising committee meeting for the animal shelter was scheduled for that evening. One positive thing Grace had done for herself after the breakups with both Will and Cliff was to become a volunteer at the Cedar Cove Animal Shelter. Two Saturdays a month she interviewed potential pet owners, walked and fed the animals and did whatever else she could to be useful. Janet Webb, who was in charge of fund-raising, had asked Grace to be on her committee and she\u0027d gladly accepted. Buttercup finished her drink and sat down at Grace\u0027s feet while Grace sipped her coffee. As she mulled over her day, she scanned the headlines, then got dressed—khaki cotton trousers, a white tailored shirt, her favorite black blazer— and drove to the library. Grace\u0027s afternoon passed quickly. Following work, rather than race home before her meeting, Grace strolled along the waterfront. The marina was lovely, especially this time of year. In a couple of months, the Thursday-night Concerts on the Cove would start again. Cliff had often joined her for the concerts. They\u0027d buy dinner and sit on the grass.... Grace shook her head in an effort to dispel her memories of Cliff. He\u0027d insisted it was over and she had no choice but to accept his decision. Before she left for the meeting, Grace went to the Pot Belly Deli where she bought a sandwich, eating it at a small table by herself. Then she drove out to the shelter. Janet Webb and the other committee members had already arrived. \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re on our committee,\" Janet said and introduced Grace to Mary Sanchez and Margaret White, both long-standing volunteers. Janet and Margaret were about the same age as Grace, but Mary was in her mid-thirties. \"We\u0027re looking for something that\u0027ll bring the entire community together,\" Janet explained as Grace took a seat at the table in the conference room. \"For the last few years we\u0027ve done the usual bake sales and car washes.\" \"We had a dog wash that one year,\" Margaret reminded her. \"Yes, and while those fund-raising events have been successful, they\u0027ve been fairly small-scale. I\u0027d like something with a little more.. .punch.\" \"What about a bachelor auction?\" Mary suggested excitedly. It was clear she\u0027d been thinking about the idea for quite some time and was nearly out of her chair with enthusiasm. \"I\u0027ve read about them and I think it\u0027s a wonderful idea, don\u0027t you?\" Janet hesitated. \"Maybe, but I\u0027m married and so are a lot of other women in town.\" \"Yes, but I\u0027m not and, well, I know I\u0027d certainly be willing to pay for the pleasure of having a handsome man at my disposal for an entire evening.\" She glanced eagerly toward Grace. \"I\u0027ll bet other single women would, too.\" Grace wasn\u0027t so sure, but she hated to squelch Mary\u0027s enthusiasm. \"Has anyone else noticed that there seem to be more animals that need adoption lately?\" she asked. \"Especially dogs...\" The ideas started to churn in her mind. \"What about a dog auction—or perhaps the shelter could do that along with the bachelors?\" \"A dog and bachelor auction?\" \"Why not?\" Grace asked. \"We could pair up the dogs with the bachelors.\" Janet seemed to be considering the idea. \"That sounds promising.\" \"The dog would be auctioned off first, and then the bachelor. Or the other way around.\" \"The bachelors would need to be a variety of ages, right?\" Mary asked. \"Of course,\" Janet said, smiling ever so slightly. Grace could tell that she was warming to the idea. \"Be sure and ask Cliff Harding to participate,\" Margaret White said, leaning closer to the table. \"I think he\u0027s the most adorable man I\u0027ve seen in ages, and he\u0027s single, too.\" \"Who?\" Janet asked, frowning. \"Cliff Harding,\" Margaret repeated. \"You obviously haven\u0027t noticed him around town, but trust me, I have. He\u0027s a hunk.\" Mary looked across the table at Grace. \"You were going out with him for a while, weren\u0027t you?\" It was all Grace could do to nod. Cliff was a natural choice for the bachelor auction. Her enthusiasm for the project did a nosedive, but she didn\u0027t dare show her feelings. \"Can you think of anyone else who\u0027d agree to be auctioned off for charity?\" Janet asked. \"Bruce Peyton,\" Grace suggested with a shrug. \"He\u0027s a widower who brings his daughter into the library once a week.\" \"Ah, yes,\" Mary said. \"I remember when his wife was killed in an automobile accident. When was that, anyway?\" \"It must\u0027ve been two or three years ago,\" Margaret replied. \"I knew her mother, Sandy. Tragic, tragic accident. I think Stephanie\u0027s death was what killed her. Sandy was gone within a year—cancer.\" Grace felt terrible for the little girl who\u0027d lost both her mother and grandmother within such a short period. She didn\u0027t know Bruce well, but he seemed loving and protective of his daughter. She didn\u0027t envy him the task of raising the little girl on his own. \"Ben Rhodes has stirred a few hearts down at the SeniorCenter,\" Grace said, wondering how Charlotte would feel about this. Mary nodded in approval. \"Ben\u0027s an excellent choice and, seeing that he\u0027s retired navy, he just might be able to get us a few young seamen who\u0027d be willing to do a good deed for charity.\" \"That\u0027s a great idea.\" Janet seemed absolutely delighted now. She quickly wrote down the names on the pad. \"Barry Stokes is always good about donating his time and talent to charity auctions.\" Barry was the local auctioneer whose big red barn and auction headquarters could be seen from the highway. \"This is going to be just great,\" Mary burbled. \"It\u0027s certainly better than another bake sale.\" \"Why don\u0027t we talk to Seth and Justine Gunderson about letting us use The Lighthouse for the event?\" Grace said. \"Perfect,\" Mary agreed. \"We want to make this classy. The restaurant\u0027s just the right size, too.\" Janet picked up a pen and pad and started writing down suggestions and assignments. \"Okay, I\u0027ll see what I can do to get The Lighthouse. I\u0027ll get in touch with Barry, too.\" Janet made a second notation for herself. \"Mary and Margaret, why don\u0027t you two make up a list of potential bachelors?\" The women nodded simultaneously. Janet pointed her pen in Grace\u0027s direction. \"How about if you work on publicizing the event—posters, newspaper ads, radio and the like?\" Grace nodded. \"Of course.\" \"I\u0027ll ask for volunteers to work the auction at the next board meeting.\" Janet looked pleased with herself. \"I think we\u0027re onto something really wonderful this year.\" The four women continued to discuss the event and it was after eight before they ended the meeting. Margaret White walked out to the parking lot with Grace. \"I don\u0027t know about anyone else but I\u0027d write a blank check to spend an evening with Cliff Harding.\" Grace forced a smile. \"I nearly pass out every time he comes to the vet\u0027s office.\" She giggled like a schoolgirl. \"See you next week,\" she said. She climbed into her car and drove off. Grace slid into her own vehicle and braced her hands against the steering wheel. The thought of Cliff with another woman made her feel a regret so strong that for a moment she was nearly sick to her stomach. She couldn\u0027t bear it and at the same time realized she had to. Worst of all, she was to blame for her own unhappiness. Six Peggy put the finishing touches on the dinner table as Bob straightened up the family room. He was pleased Peggy had chosen to serve their guests in the kitchen rather than the formal dining room. Jack and Olivia, who were back from their honeymoon, were coming for dinner, and he considered Jack as much family as friend. Olivia now, too. In some ways, however, Jack was even closer than family. Although Bob had twenty-one years of sobriety behind him, he knew he was a single drink away from insanity. He still took it one day at a time and routinely attended A A meetings. It was through Alcoholics Anonymous that he\u0027d met Jack Griffin. Bob and Peggy had been living in the Spokane area when Jack approached Bob and asked him to be his AA sponsor. That was the beginning of their strong friendship. After Bob and Peggy returned to Cedar Cove and purchased this house, they\u0027d invited Jack to visit. He\u0027d fallen in love with the small-town community. When the editor\u0027s job opened up at the Cedar Cove Chronicle, Jack—a longtime newsman—had applied and been offered the position. Soon after he moved to town, he met Judge Olivia Lockhart. It\u0027d taken some mighty fast talking on Jack\u0027s part, but he\u0027d finally convinced her to marry him. Bob was proud to have stood up as Jack\u0027s best man. \"Honey, would you fill the water glasses?\" Peggy asked as she scurried about the kitchen. \"Sure thing.\" His wife was a marvel, Bob thought as he dumped ice cubes into the pitcher. Peggy was a master gardener, homemaker and cook extraordinaire. The scent of her chicken cordon bleu wafted through the kitchen and made his mouth water. He knew she\u0027d prepared his favorite broccoli salad and a special mashed-potato casserole as part of their meal. Peggy had made a habit of cooking all his favorite dishes since Sheriff Davis\u0027s last visit—as if she was determined to make his last days on earth happy ones. Not that she\u0027d admit it, he realized, but Bob knew she was worried and he humored her. Much of the success of Thyme and Tide was due to Peggy\u0027s skill at making people feel welcome and comfortable. Bob didn\u0027t discount his own talents. He was a reasonably adequate handyman, but it was Peggy who held everything together, including his life. She was busy at the sink—doing what, he could only guess. He finished his assigned duty, set the pitcher aside and came up behind her, sliding his arms around her waist. \"Bob,\" she protested as he spread kisses down the side of her neck. \"We have guests due any minute.\" \"Hmm.\" \"They\u0027re the ones on the honeymoon, not us.\" \"Does that mean you\u0027re not interested in a little hanky-panky?\" \"Bob Beldon!\" \"Is that a yes, you are, or a no, you\u0027re not?\" \"It\u0027s a yes, but could you kindly wait until after our guests leave?\" She feigned impatience, but Bob knew her far too well. Their marriage had gone through several stages, some good and some difficult, but through it all their love life had remained active. Peggy\u0027s talents extended into the bedroom and for that, Bob was most appreciative. The doorbell chimed and Bob released his wife. Peggy made a show of tucking in her blouse. This was the first week they\u0027d been without overnight guests, and the absence of people in the house had taken some getting used to. Bob enjoyed it for a change, but he knew that before long they\u0027d both grow bored. \"Do you want me to get that?\" Peggy asked. \"No, I will.\" Peggy sighed, and Bob sensed that she was nervous. She didn\u0027t know Olivia well, and he could tell that Peggy sincerely hoped they\u0027d all be friends. She hadn\u0027t worked quite this hard to impress someone in a very long while. Dinner in the kitchen would be more intimate, more casual, and definitely suited Jack\u0027s personality. Olivia\u0027s, too, he hoped....","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-6.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) Dear Reader, I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
