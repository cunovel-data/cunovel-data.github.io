I didn\u0027t mean to sleep in this morning.\" \"I know. But you don\u0027t want it to happen again.\" \"No, I don\u0027t,\" Hannah agreed. \"I need this job.\" Their houseguest had been two hours late for work, and the PancakePalace had phoned looking for her. Peggy had managed to get the girl up and moving, but it had been no easy task. By the time Hannah got into town, the restaurant was practically out of clean dishes. To her credit, Hannah had stayed two hours past her shift in an effort to make up for her tardiness. \"If you\u0027re all right, I should probably leave,\" Roy said, getting to his feet. \"We\u0027re fine,\" Bob lied. \"You go on home. Thanks for everything.\" He deeply appreciated Roy\u0027s friendship and concern, which went far beyond their professional relationship. Bob walked him to the kitchen door, then watched as Roy drove off. \"Are you tired?\" he asked Peggy. She stood in the middle of the kitchen, completely still, as if she was afraid to move a single step in any direction. \"You can\u0027t be serious about going upstairs and sleeping,\" she said. When he didn\u0027t answer, she added, \"You honestly think you\u0027ll sleep?\" \"No, but that\u0027s not the point.\" Peggy smiled. \"I don\u0027t think I can, either. Want to watch some TV?\" They both knew they were in for a long, restless night. Twenty-Six Grace Sherman had been looking forward to the Dog and Bachelor Auction with equal measures of anticipation and dread. The fund-raising event had initially been her idea and Mary\u0027s, and Grace wanted it to be successful. At the same time, she was aware that she\u0027d be sitting by while the man she loved was on the auction block. She couldn\u0027t join in the bidding herself, both because she couldn\u0027t afford it and because she knew how he felt about her now. Other women would bid on Cliff and he\u0027d walk away with someone else on his arm. On the evening of July tenth, the parking lot of The Lighthouse Restaurant was fast filling to capacity. Women lined up outside the door, and it wasn\u0027t for dinner and drinks, Grace suspected, although the food, as always, would be exceptional. No, all those women were eager to get the best seats in the house for a close-up view of the dogs and—especially—the bachelors. Even before the auction had begun, everyone could tell it was going to be an unqualified success. \"This is just fabulous,\" Mary Sanchez said. She stood with Margaret White at the entrance of the restaurant. As soon as the doors opened, they\u0027d collect the tickets that had already been sold. The women waiting to place their bids jostled outside, peeking through the windows, chatting and laughing. The mood was jovial and high-spirited. \"The natives are getting restless,\" Margaret shouted to Janet Webb over the noise and laughter from outside. Janet was getting everything organized for the cashiers, who were situated at the rear of the restaurant near the bar area. \"Is there anything I can do?\" Grace asked. She\u0027d come to offer an extra pair of hands before the auction started. Her official duties, however, had been completed weeks earlier. \"Yes, Grace, there is,\" Janet said, her tone serious. \"I want you to enjoy this event. You\u0027ve worked hard and the shelter deeply appreciates all your effort.\" \"It was my pleasure.\" Grace figured that enjoying this evening wasn\u0027t remotely possible, but she was determined to try. All she could hope was that the woman who won Cliff would appreciate what a wonderful man he was. Janet, the director of the animal shelter, walked over to the restaurant foyer, and gave the signal for the doors to open. As the crowd began to enter, Grace observed with surprise the number of young single women in Cedar Cove. She\u0027d thought most of the people here would be familiar to her but quite a few of the women weren\u0027t. Like a crashing tide against the shoreline, people—young women, older ones and even men who were clearly there as spectators— flooded into the restaurant, tipping over chairs and scooting around tables as they jockeyed for seats. Thankfully Grace had been able to reserve a table for friends. Olivia and Jack showed up a few minutes after the doors opened, and Charlotte and Ben followed. Grace had encouraged her daughters to attend for the entertainment value of the event, but both Maryellen and Kelly had decided to spend the night at home with their husbands and families. Grace didn\u0027t blame them. \"Can you believe this crowd,\" Grace commented to Olivia, looking around. It was difficult to hear over the high-decibel chatter all around them. The atmosphere of fun and excitement was as strong as the pervasive scent of perfume. Grace could only imagine what it was like in the waiting area where the bachelors and dogs were congregated. Silently she read over the list of the bachelors, fifteen in all. Pairing them up with dogs had been a complicated task, taken on by Janet Webb. Grace wondered what breed—or mixed breed—she\u0027d choose to accompany Cliff. A shepherd of some kind was her guess. Large, gentle and handsome... The temporary stage, with an extended walking platform, reached halfway into the restaurant, with tables and chairs arranged on both sides. The idea was that the bachelor would walk out with the dog on a leash. Whoever won could take the dog or the bachelor or both. If the winner only wanted one, then the auction would start over with the remaining entrant, whether man or dog. As Grace read over the rules described in the program, she hoped this novel idea would raise the funds the shelter needed, and more. \"If I\u0027d been one of the bachelors, I bet I would\u0027ve brought in top dollar,\" Jack boasted with a cocky grin. \"Unfortunately Olivia got me first.\" Olivia glanced up from her program and arched one brow. \"Unfortunately? Is that a complaint, Mr. Griffin?\" The teasing left his eyes and was replaced with a slow, easy smile. \"Not at all. I meant unfortunately for these other ladies.\" At her smirk, he shook his head. \"In all seriousness, though, I think I got the better half of this deal.\" \"I\u0027m not so sure I agree.\" Olivia rested her head against him, and Jack\u0027s arm came around her shoulders. The gesture was so romantic that Grace had to look away. Rarely had she felt lonelier or more alone, but she was finished with self-recrimination. Life goes on, as the old saying had it, and so would she. \"I see Stanley\u0027s one of the bachelors,\" Charlotte said disapprovingly. She pointed out her ex-son-in-law\u0027s name to Ben Rhodes. \"Stanley doesn\u0027t even live in Cedar Cove.\" \"I know,\" Grace murmured, \"but Stan wanted to do his part for charity.\" \"Did you tell him charity begins at home?\" \"Mother!\" Olivia mildly chastised her. Charlotte frowned. \"I only hope his ego doesn\u0027t get the better of him—for once.\" In Grace\u0027s opinion, it was too late for that. Stan had volunteered under the assumption that any number of women would battle to outbid each other for the opportunity to date him. \"I can\u0027t wait to see which dog Janet paired him up with,\" she said, leaning close to Olivia as the waiters started to circulate with salads. \"You mean you don\u0027t know?\" She shook her head. \"Janet\u0027s not deciding until she\u0027s had a chance to mingle with the bachelors and meet them.\" \"This could be intriguing.\" Soon everyone was seated and the main course had been quickly and efficiently served, with Justine directing the waiters from the kitchen. Janet stepped up to the podium set off to one side of the platform and reviewed the rules. Next she introduced the auctioneer and Barry Stokes stepped forward. Barry greeted everyone with a smile and a few good-natured jokes about bachelors. He managed to work the audience to an even higher level of excitement, periodically reminding everyone of the important role the Animal Shelter played in the community. He pointed out that the final bidding price would be separate for the dog and the man. If the bidder wanted the dog and the bachelor, the bid was actually doubled. So if the bidder wanted either the dog or the bachelor, the bidding would begin again. Dogs made wonderful pets, he said at the end of his introduction. And so did bachelors—which brought a roar from the crowd. The first bachelor presented was Bruce Peyton. Grace knew Bruce through the library; the widower often came in with his young daughter. Grace recalled his wife Stephanie, too, and was well aware that the young father continued to grieve. Bruce was matched up with a bassett hound. Grace could tell how nervous he was by the way his gaze darted around the room. The order of the bachelors\u0027 appearances had been chosen by lottery, and she felt sorry for Bruce, whose name had obviously been pulled first. The whispers rose as Bruce walked down the runway, the bassett hound trudging beside him. It was clear that Bruce would\u0027ve preferred to hurry, but that was impossible with the slow-moving dog. The first bid came from one of the women who worked at Get Nailed. She was immediately outbid by a woman from the local pharmacy. The bidding went back and forth between them until the last moment. Bruce—and the dog— were about to be won for the bargain price of two hundred and thirty-five dollars each when Lois Habbersmith, who worked with Maryellen at the gallery, shocked everyone. \"Three hundred and fifty dollars!\" The two women who\u0027d been bidding stared at each other, shook their heads and sat down. \"Three hundred and fifty dollars, going once, going twice.\" Barry paused and pointed his gavel at the woman from the salon. \"Are you sure you want to quit so soon? The bassett hound alone is a bargain at that price.\" The two previous bidders shook their heads again. \"Sold,\" Barry announced and slammed down the gavel. \"Now, which do you want? Bruce or the bassett?\" \"Both!\" \"Three hundred and fifty dollars each,\" Barry reminded her. \"Yes.\" Lois gleefully pulled out her checkbook and maneuvered around several chairs as she made her way to the back of the room. Barry chuckled. \"You\u0027re married, Lois. What\u0027s Don going to think when you bring home a dog and a bachelor?\" \"Don approves.\" Several laughs followed, along with good-natured teasing. Lois dismissed Barry\u0027s comment with a wave of her hand. \"Don and I already decided we\u0027d get a dog. And I promised him whoever I bid on would be tall enough to reach the second-story windows on the ladder. They need a good washing, and Bruce looks tall enough to do it and young enough not to complain.\" \"In other words, you purchased your bachelor to relieve Don of washing the outside windows?\" \"I did. Those windows haven\u0027t been cleaned in three years. Don said to go for it and I did.\" \"You want me to wash your windows?\" Bruce Peyton asked, visibly disappointed. \"Hey, is that legal?\" \"Sure it is.\" Barry laughed, nodding his head. \"You volunteered for this, and she paid good money for you.\" Bruce didn\u0027t seem too happy with this turn of events. Giving Barry a disgruntled look, he walked off the stage. The chatter diminished as the second bachelor was announced—Cal Washbum, the horse trainer Grace had met at Cliff\u0027s ranch. He was matched with a spotted gray-and-black Australian Shepherd. Again Grace thought it was a good pairing. Cal was a quiet man, gifted with horses.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-25.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) Dear Reader, I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
