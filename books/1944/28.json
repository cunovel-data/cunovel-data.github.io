{"id":67110,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"\"All right,\" Jon said, leaning against the wooden slats of his deck chair. \"That does it.\"\n \"What?\" His determined words startled her.\n \"Turn in your two-week notice.\"\n \"Jon...\"\n \"You clearly want to be at home.\"\n \"Jon, I can\u0027t, not yet.\" While it was true she wanted to be home with Katie and begin working as Jon\u0027s manager, she couldn\u0027t leave the gallery in the lurch. The owners had always been wonderful to her; not only that, she couldn\u0027t abandon Lois during the busiest time of the year.\n \"You\u0027re miserable,\" Jon said. Holding his wineglass, he frowned at her, and Maryellen tried to reassure him with a warm, loving smile.\n \"We were jammed this afternoon,\" she said, \"and I hardly had a moment to myself, but that\u0027s how this business goes. Anyway, Lois isn\u0027t ready to assume management responsibilities yet. She\u0027s learning, though.\"\n \"You aren\u0027t getting enough sleep.\"\n \"Would you stop trying to fix everything?\" Although she meant to use a teasing tone, the remark came out sounding sharp and impatient.\n Jon frowned more heavily. \"That\u0027s what I thought a husband did.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry....\" Maryellen didn\u0027t dare mention the reason for her mood. Standing, she collected the dirty dishes. \"I guess I\u0027m just out of sorts.\"\n Jon brightened suddenly. \"Could that mean what I think it means?\"\n Maryellen shook her head. She certainly hadn\u0027t had any problem getting pregnant with Katie and although they weren\u0027t using birth control, she wasn\u0027t pregnant with their second child yet.\n Jon took her news with a light shrug. \"I guess we\u0027ll just have to try harder. I want to experience this next pregnancy from the beginning.\"\n Maryellen was heartened by the prospect. \"That sounds good to me.\"\n While Jon dealt with bills and paperwork downstairs, Maryellen bathed Katie and gently rocked her to sleep. She brushed the soft curls from her daughter\u0027s forehead, holding her securely as Katie sucked energetically at her bottle. Maryellen had gradually stopped breastfeeding the month before and now gave Katie a bottle early in the morning and at bedtime.\n Maryellen glanced around the nursery, which always brought her a fresh surge of pleasure. Jon had drawn and painted a series of wild animals along the walls, creating for each a background that reflected its natural habitat.\n Jon\u0027s parents would never see this. Maryellen closed her eyes, discouraged by the hopelessness of the situation.\n \"The object is to put Katie to sleep, not you,\" Jon whispered.\n She opened her eyes to see him standing in the doorway, arms crossed. He wasn\u0027t a handsome man by conventional standards, but the sight of him stirred her emotions and her senses.\n \"It\u0027s been a long day,\" she said.\n \"Then take a hot bath, relax, go to bed,\" Jon advised.\n \"I\u0027ve got the dishes.\"\n \"I already took care of that.\"\n \"But Jon...\" she protested. Their agreement was that when he cooked, she\u0027d do the cleanup afterward. \"You spoil me.\"\n He grinned at that. \"I want to spoil you. I love you, Maryellen. You and Katie are my family. You\u0027re everything to me.\"\n Instead of bringing joy, his words fell on her like stones. It was her own fault, her own guilt; she\u0027d interfered where she had no right to and cruelly raised his parents\u0027 hopes.\n \"I think I will go to bed early tonight,\" Maryellen said and placed Katie in her crib. She covered her with a light blanket, waiting to be sure their little girl was truly asleep before she silently left the room.\n Jon took the empty bottle downstairs while Maryellen ran hot water into the tub. She scented it with lavender salts, then got in and sank into the soothing bath.\n Her decision was made. She had no choice. She\u0027d answer Joseph Bowman\u0027s letter the next day and tell him he was asking the impossible of her. She\u0027d mail photos of Katie from time to time and keep his parents updated, but that was all she could promise. She\u0027d also ask them not to contact her again.\n The water had cooled by the time Maryellen stepped out of the tub. She dressed in a cotton nightie and a short robe. Jon was watching television and she sat on the sofa beside him, nestling gratefully in his arms.\n \"Feel better?\" he asked, kissing the top of her head.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Good.\"\n \"Remember what you were saying earlier?\" she murmured, tilting her head and kissing the side of his jaw.\n \"About what?\"\n \"Me getting pregnant.\"\n She felt his mouth relax into a smile. \"I remember that quite distinctly.\"\n Maryellen glanced toward the television. \"How interested are you in that program?\"\n \"I can catch a rerun.\" He used the remote to turn off the TV, then kissed her as if he\u0027d been waiting all day for just this moment.\n Maryellen entwined her arms around his neck and opened her mouth to his exploration. Jon moaned softly, sliding his hand inside the folds of her robe, and sought her breast. Between soft kisses intermingled with lengthier ones, Maryellen reached over to snap off the lamp. They stood and began to walk toward the stairs, but didn\u0027t make it to the first step before he gathered her close and kissed her once more.\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever get tired of making love to you.\" He kissed the vulnerable hollow of her throat.\n \"I should hope not.\" Maryellen laughed and, walking backward, advanced one step up from him, circling his ear with her tongue. Jon groaned and she moved up an additional step. He followed, his hand again seeking her breasts. This time it was Maryellen who released a soft sigh of pleasure. If they didn\u0027t hurry up these stairs, they\u0027d never make it to the bedroom.\n As they kissed, Maryellen tore at his shirt while he removed her robe.\n \"Jon,\" she whispered, her voice thick with passion. They were halfway up the stairs, both partially undressed.\n Still one step below her, he hugged her waist and buried his face between the fullness of her breasts.\n Maryellen could feel her knees weakening. Framing his face with both hands, she gazed directly into his eyes. \"Come on. I think there\u0027s a more comfortable way of doing this. It\u0027s called a bed.\"\n Jon grinned up at her and then, in one sweeping motion, he swung her into his arms and carried her up the remaining stairs. Giggling like teenagers, they fell onto the bed and into each other\u0027s embrace.\n Twenty-Nine\n \"Who left the milk out overnight?\" Bob demanded as Peggy walked into the kitchen early Tuesday morning.\n Peggy poured coffee into her favorite mug. \"Good morning to you too, sweetheart.\"\n Bob scowled. \"I ended up dumping the entire half gallon.\"\n They both realized it could only have been Hannah. Peggy wished she knew what it was about the young woman that irritated her husband so much. Bob took offense at the slightest thing; the milk incident was a good example. Hannah had worked the late shift at the PancakePalace and returned to the house some time after Bob and Peggy were asleep. Apparently she\u0027d decided to drink a glass of milk before going to bed and forgotten to put the carton back in the refrigerator. Yes, it was a thoughtless act, but it wasn\u0027t catastrophic. Bob had leaped at the opportunity to shriek and howl with indignation. Enough was enough.\n \"Stop it this minute, Bob Beldon,\" Peggy said calmly after her first sip of coffee. \"I\u0027ll mention it to Hannah, but she doesn\u0027t need you berating her.\" The girl was timid as it was, and one harsh word from Bob would destroy her.\n \"Does she think—\"\n \"Bob.\" Peggy cut him off before he could wake Hannah with his ranting. \"Aren\u0027t you meeting Pastor Dave this morning?\" They had a standing golf date every Tuesday. Whether they played in the morning or the afternoon depended on the pastor\u0027s schedule.\n Her husband looked at his watch, frowning. He nodded abruptly. \"I\u0027ll be back before noon.\"\n \"Yes, dear,\" Peggy murmured as she headed for her chair in the living room. Each morning she took a few moments to meditate before beginning her day. In those moments, she organized her thoughts and made mental plans of what she hoped to accomplish. Bob was often reading from the AA Big Book, and she\u0027d gotten into the habit of claiming a little peace and quiet for herself. It allowed her to start the day in a tranquil frame of mind.\n Bob paused at the door that led to the patio. \"You\u0027ll say something to Hannah, right?\"\n \"Yes, dear.\"\n He expelled his breath loudly enough for her to hear. \"Don\u0027t patronize me, Peggy.\"\n She didn\u0027t know what had set off her husband\u0027s foul mood, but assumed that whatever was bothering him would work its way out of his system before he finished his golf game. More than likely he\u0027d come home at lunchtime apologetic and contrite.\n A few minutes later, just after Peggy had settled into her morning routine, Hannah stepped quietly into the family room. Her hair fell in thin brown tendrils about her face, which was ashen. She bit her lower lip, hesitating as if she wasn\u0027t sure she should interrupt Peggy.\n \"You heard?\" Peggy asked softly.\n The young woman nodded. \"I\u0027m so sorry.... I didn\u0027t mean to leave out the milk.\"\n Peggy tried to reassure her with a smile. \"I know you didn\u0027t.\"\n \"I\u0027ll pick up another half gallon before I leave for work this afternoon.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\" Peggy gestured for Hannah to sit across from her. The girl looked shaken and Peggy hoped to comfort her.\n \"Did you sleep well?\" Peggy asked.\n Hannah\u0027s nod was tentative. \"My dad used to yell, too.\"\n The last thing Hannah needed was for Bob to do the same. \"Bob didn\u0027t mean anything by it.\"\n \"I.. .know. It\u0027s just that when I hear a man yell, especially one who\u0027s around my dad\u0027s age, it... affects me, you know?\"\n \"Of course it does.\" Peggy\u0027s irritation with her husband rose.\n \"My father was an unhappy person most of my life.\"\n Hannah rarely mentioned her father. Peggy didn\u0027t know whether that was because of her grief at his death or because her memories of his accident were too painful to talk about.\n \"Sometimes at night, when I was a little girl, I\u0027d wake up to the sound of my father shouting.\"\n Peggy felt a moment\u0027s shock—and a rush of pity for Hannah. Having lived with an alcoholic for years, she wondered if Max Russell drank, too. \"Did your father have a drinking problem?\"\n Hannah shook her head. \"Sometimes he drank too much, but it wasn\u0027t a problem. Not a bad one, anyway. Some days he was mean for no reason. He used to shout at Mom and me for the littlest things.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"He wasn\u0027t a bad person, you know. I really loved my dad.\"\n \"Of course you did.\" Peggy wondered if Hannah fully understood what her father had experienced during the war.\n \"My mom stood by him through all the times we had to move and all the fights.\" Tears filled her eyes. \"It\u0027s so wrong that she died, so wrong.\"\n \"You moved around a lot?\"\n Hannah needed a minute to compose herself. She swallowed visibly. \"Dad was never able to hold down a job for long. He\u0027d be fine for a while, and then he\u0027d drift into this...dark place.\"\n \"Dark place?\"\n \"That\u0027s what Mom called it. He\u0027d be happy, and suddenly it would be like someone had turned off the lights. I could always tell when it happened. So could Mom. She\u0027d ask me to go to my room and I would, because I knew what was going to follow.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-28.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: \n 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) \n Dear Reader, \n I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
