It\u0027s just a postcard and if you read it again you\u0027ll see it isn\u0027t threatening.\"\n Corrie picked up the card they\u0027d received that day and read it aloud. \"The past has a way of catching up with the present.\" She leveled her gaze on Roy. \"That sounds ominous to me.\"\n Roy shook his head. \"Not necessarily.\"\n \"I hope you\u0027re taking this seriously.\" Restless now, Corrie started to pace.\n Roy didn\u0027t want to upset her any more than she already was—but, in fact, he hadn\u0027t taken the threat seriously. Not really. Until this morning. One postcard he could dismiss, but two? The earlier message had been something vague about regrets. Sure he had regrets. Every police officer did. It came with the territory.\n \"Think!\" Corrie insisted. \"This must have to do with one of your old cases. So you should review your old cases and narrow it down to someone capable of.. .this.\"\n Roy shook his head again. \"I was on the force for more than twenty years and handled thousands of cases. Do I have regrets about any of them? Damn straight I do, but I always did what I believed to be right.\"\n Corrie refused to let it go. \"Could it be someone who was released from prison recently?\"\n \"I don\u0027t have a clue.\" Over time he\u0027d helped put quite a few men behind bars. A whole lot of suspects weren\u0027t particularly grateful for his detection skills.\n \"What about threats? Did anyone threaten you while you were on the force?\"\n There\u0027d been some; convicted felons often looked for someone else to blame for their bad luck. He was a convenient target, but no one case stood out in his mind.\n \"Forget it,\" Roy urged, snatching up a pen, pretending to get to work.\n \"I can\u0027t,\" Corrie murmured, but she returned to the outer office.\n Roy could tell how shaken she was. He wanted to reassure her but didn\u0027t know how. He\u0027d wasted time mulling over the first postcard and hadn\u0027t come up with anything. If some nutcase wanted to mail him a message on the back of a postcard every few weeks, what could he do about it? Apparently, whoever was doing this derived a bizarre sense of satisfaction from it. In Roy\u0027s opinion, his mystery correspondent didn\u0027t seem intent on causing him harm.\n After a few minutes, he went to check on Corrie, using the excuse of refreshing his coffee. He found her kneeling in front of the filing cabinet, sorting through old police files. He\u0027d always kept a personal notebook about every major case he\u0027d worked, as well as newspaper articles and other information. Corrie, an inveterate organizer, had made files for each year. She had two or three on the floor beside her.\n \"What are you doing?\" he asked as he poured coffee into his mug.\n \"Checking out our old Cedar Cove cases, plus some of your notes from the Seattle PD.\"\n Roy sipped his coffee and turned to take a look at one of the names. \"Parker,\" he read slowly.\n \"Harry Parker,\" Corrie reminded him. \"Three years ago. He befriended a neighbor, and was supposedly helping the old man with yardwork and such.\"\n It sounded familiar.\n \"The old man\u0027s daughter, who lived back east, said she suspected Harry of stealing her father blind and asked us to look into it. The woman had good instincts.\"\n \"I remember.\" Roy said. Harry was currently serving time at the men\u0027s prison in Shelton for forging checks and theft.\n \"As I recall, Harry swore you tricked him into a confession.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t have anything to do with his statement to the sheriff,\" Roy countered.\n \"Nevertheless, Harry blamed you.\"\n Roy doubted it was Harry who\u0027d mailed him those two postcards. He suspected this went back to his days in the Seattle Police Department.\n \"It\u0027s none of our Cedar Cove cases,\" he said.\n \"What makes you so sure?\" his wife demanded.\n \"I just am. Whoever this is, whatever it\u0027s about, it goes way back.\" The tone of this latest card said as much. Something from his past was about to hit him square between the eyes.\n They spent the morning looking through old files and journals, some cases going as far back as twenty years. He ended up with a short list of people to check out, but didn\u0027t feel hopeful. This afternoon he planned to make a few phone calls.\n Corrie went out to lunch with Peggy Beldon and came back in lighter spirits. While they were at the mall they\u0027d run into a sale of some sort. Roy had stopped counting all the money she\u0027d supposedly saved them by shopping at sales. Interestingly, she found it logical to spend money in order to save it.\n \"Peggy said something interesting at lunch,\" Corrie said as she stepped into Roy\u0027s office. \"Bob thought someone was following him again a little while ago.\"\n This was news to Roy. \"He never mentioned it to me.\"\n \"That\u0027s because after a few blocks, the car went past him. Bob turned around and followed the other car for a short distance, but in retrospect he doesn\u0027t think he was being followed, after all.\"\n \"I guess that\u0027s why he didn\u0027t tell me about it.\"\n \"Do you remember the night Bob phoned you in a panic because he was convinced he was being followed?\" Corrie asked casually.\n \"Sure. He drove over to the sheriff\u0027s office.\"\n \"While we were at lunch, I realized something else. Something I\u0027d completely forgotten until Peggy mentioned it.\"\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\n Corrie leaned against the doorjamb. \"Bob\u0027s car was in the repair shop that week.\"\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Roy whispered slowly. He was beginning to connect the dots.\n \"In other words, Bob was driving our car that night and not his own.\"\n Roy nodded. That possibility had never occurred to him and he suddenly felt a little foolish. Once again, Corrie had proved herself a natural detective. \"In other words, whoever was following Bob might\u0027ve been looking for me.\"\n \"Do you still think those postcards don\u0027t mean anything?\" Corrie whispered.\n Forty-Five\n Grace was meeting Olivia for lunch midweek. So much had happened in both their lives and Grace wanted—no, needed—time with her friend. She was dying to talk about Cliff and the way he\u0027d come to sit with her during Charlotte and Ben\u0027s wedding. The ceremony lingered in her mind; she\u0027d been moved by its simple beauty and by the love Charlotte and Ben so obviously shared. Tears had blurred Grace\u0027s eyes, but she wasn\u0027t the only one who\u0027d reacted emotionally. When she\u0027d been able to look up, she saw that several other people were wiping tears from their cheeks. Even Cliff seemed touched by the vows Charlotte and Ben had written, vows that acknowledged love for their dead spouses and love for each other. Currently the newly weds were off to Victoria, British Columbia, for a short honeymoon.\n Naturally Will had been there for both the ceremony and the reception, as had Stan. Grace had avoided them as much as possible, but she was more concerned about Will. However, Cliff seemed to understand how difficult the reception would be for her, and had remained close to her side. Several times Grace had noticed Will heading in her direction, but he stopped when he saw that Cliff was nearby. Grace assumed he\u0027d return to his wife after this, which was just as well.\n Grace valued Cliff\u0027s protectiveness at the wedding and, even more, the way he\u0027d helped her with Maryellen. His calm presence had kept her focused as they comforted Maryellen and waited for the Aid Car. Afterward he stayed with Katie until Grace could come home.\n Maryellen had been released from the hospital the next day. Jon had insisted on taking her and Katie home. Grace sensed that things weren\u0027t right between them. Now wasn\u0027t the time to pry, though, not when they were grieving over their loss. Still, Grace had every intention of finding out what had gone wrong in her daughter\u0027s marriage.\n The miscarriage had devastated both Maryellen and Jon, but they were young and there\u0027d be other children. Yet she knew it was difficult to think rationally after such a painful loss, and in her own way Grace grieved for her grandchild.\n Grace was looking forward to her visit with Olivia, who\u0027d just had a new grandchild—her third. When Olivia phoned that morning to confirm lunch, she\u0027d jubilantly announced that James and Selina had a baby boy, born early on September eighth. Mother and son were doing fine, and James was one proud papa. They\u0027d named the baby Adam Jordan. Three-year-old Isabella was said to be excited about becoming an older sister.\n Grace had good news of her own, most of which had to do with Cliff, of course.\n Before he left her on Saturday night, he\u0027d made a point of letting her know he\u0027d be in town on Wednesday and would come to the library. She was pleased and so relieved that they were resuming their relationship and that he was willing to give her another chance.\n Just after noon, when Loretta returned from lunch, Grace retrieved her purse and small lunch bag. She decided to wait for Olivia by the totem pole outside the library. They each had a limited lunch break, and Grace didn\u0027t want Olivia to waste time looking for her in the library.\n They\u0027d already planned to bring their own lunches and eat in the waterfront park. With the refinancing of the house, Grace\u0027s tight budget was even tighter. In an indirect way, repaying Dan\u0027s loan had been a financial help, however; Grace had gotten a much lower rate of interest and arranged to pay off the house in half the time that\u0027d been left on the original mortgage. She had to keep a close watch on her spending, but she\u0027d manage. The fact was, she\u0027d done a fairly good job of it ever since Dan\u0027s disappearance.\n Grace loved Cedar Cove\u0027s waterfront. She looked out over the marina and across the cove to the Bremerton shipyard. She could see the massive aircraft carrier George Washington in the distance and remembered the joy of the wives and families when it finally returned from the Persian Gulf.\n \"Grace.\" A man\u0027s voice interrupted her musings.\n A sense of dread struck her and she turned slowly to discover Will Jefferson. She\u0027d assumed he\u0027d left town by now, assumed she wouldn\u0027t see him again, assumed everything had already been said.\n \"I had to see you one last time before I went home.\" His eyes pleaded with her.\n Grace peered down the hill, hoping to see Olivia. No such luck. She was trapped with Will, and although this was usually a crowded area, there was no one nearby right now.\n \"I can\u0027t believe you no longer care about me,\" he said in a voice that throbbed with sincerity.\n Grace refused to meet his gaze. So far she\u0027d been polite, but that hadn\u0027t worked. \"Believe it,\" she said sharply. \"You\u0027re married. I don\u0027t mean to be rude, but I don\u0027t want anything more to do with you. I thought I made that clear.\"\n \"Okay, fine. I\u0027ll divorce Georgia if that\u0027s the only way I can have you.\"\n Grace shook her head. She wanted to yell at him to stop harrassing her, to go home to his wife, but the polite little girl she\u0027d been wouldn\u0027t let her. Where was Olivia? Grace scanned the street, desperate to find her friend. What could possibly be taking her so long?\n \"Grace, listen to me.\" Will sounded hurt and confused. Then, as if overcome with emotion, he gripped her by the shoulders, forcing her to look at him.\n \"Leave me alone,\" she cried, jerking herself free.\n \"I can\u0027t! I love you.\"\n Sure he did. Grace might have been a fool once, but she wasn\u0027t going to play that role twice, especially with the same man. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-42.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: \n 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) \n Dear Reader, \n I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
