{"id":67103,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Again the woman turned to her husband. \"If you\u0027re interested in seeing any of his work—\" \"We\u0027d like that very much,\" the woman said, cutting Maryellen off. \"That would mean a great deal to both of us.\" Maryellen walked over to the window. \"If you stop at The Lighthouse Restaurant, which is just down the street, you\u0027ll see several of Jon\u0027s photographs on display.\" She pointed out the window. \"Until recently, Jon supplemented his income by working at the restaurant.\" \"Doing what?\" the man asked, sounding shocked. \"He was the chef.\" \"Jon?\" The woman\u0027s tone was equally puzzled. \"I... didn\u0027t realize.\" This couple seemed to know Jon. \"My husband is a man of many talents.\" Maryellen hesitated, almost afraid to ask if they were Jon\u0027s parents, uncertain what would happen if her suspicions proved to be correct. \"I—\" The woman stopped abruptly and clamped her mouth shut. Maryellen noticed how the man\u0027s arm tightened around his wife\u0027s; he seemed to be warning her that she was saying too much. \"Jon\u0027s an innovative chef. He could\u0027ve made a name for himself in that field if he\u0027d chosen to do so.\" Maryellen knew she was chattering, but it was the result of nerves. \"That\u0027s wonderful.\" \"Is there anything else I can show you?\" Maryellen asked. \u0027There are several talented local artists whose work we have in the gallery.\" \"We were only here about Jon\u0027s,\" the man said, starting toward the door. \"Thank you for your help.\" \"You said Jon\u0027s your husband?\" The woman lingered as if she wasn\u0027t ready to leave. \"We need to go,\" her husband insisted. \"In a minute, dear.\" Maryellen studied them, wondering about the silent tug-of-war going on between the older couple. It was clear the woman had more questions, no less clear that the man was eager to be on his way. \"Do you have children?\" the woman asked. Maryellen nodded. \"A daughter named Katie.\" The woman placed her hand over her heart. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027s a delightful child.\" \"Oh, yes. In looks she resembles my side of the family more, but she has Jon\u0027s temperament and his personality.\" Maryellen gently tested the waters. The woman certainly was curious. \"I suspect Katie possesses her father\u0027s artistic eye, as well, but only time will tell about that.\" \"Marion.\" The woman nodded. \"We do need to go. Thank you so much...\" Maryellen nodded and returned to her desk once the couple had left. It occurred to her a moment later that she recognized the woman\u0027s name—Marion. That, combined with the pointed questions about Jon, convinced her they had to be Jon\u0027s parents. The ones she\u0027d written shortly before her wedding. Marion and Joseph Bowman. She\u0027d asked that they not answer her letter and they\u0027d abided by her wishes. Instead they\u0027d come to Cedar Cove. Maryellen\u0027s heart leapt into her throat. She could only imagine what Jon would say if he ever found out what she\u0027d done. Twenty-Two Roy McAfee was intensely curious about the news that Hannah Russell was living with the Beldons. He wasn\u0027t a man who paid attention to idle gossip, but in this instance, he knew and trusted the source—his wife. The last time Roy had talked to Hannah, she\u0027d been on the road in search of a fresh start. Apparently she\u0027d found what she was looking for right here in Cedar Cove. Deciding to look into the matter himself, Roy drove out to the Thyme and Tide. Roy didn\u0027t have many close friends—a few cops and former cops, all still in Seattle— but over the last couple of years he\u0027d taken a liking to Bob Beldon. Corrie got along well with Peggy, too. It was rare that they found a couple whose company they both enjoyed. Peggy had the front door open by the time Roy climbed out of the car. She was waiting for him, her smile wide. \"This is a pleasant surprise,\" she said as she held the screen door. \"Bob\u0027s golfing with Pastor Dave this afternoon.\" Checking her watch, she added, \"He won\u0027t be much longer, though, if you can wait.\" \"I should have phoned.\" \"Can I help you?\" Peggy asked, leading the way into the kitchen. Without asking, she opened the refrigerator and brought out a big pitcher of lemonade, lemon slices floating on top. \"You might be able to do just that.\" Roy pulled out a chair and sat down at the round oak table. He wasn\u0027t opposed to a glass of Peggy\u0027s lemonade, especially since she made it fresh every day. \"What do you need to know?\" Peggy filled two glasses and sat across from him. Roy stretched out his arms, folding his hands on the table. \"Corrie told me Hannah Russell\u0027s living with you these days.\" Peggy nodded. \"She came in the middle of that lightning storm we had a couple of weeks back.\" She shook her head. \"Nearly frightened us out often years, arriving half-drowned on our front porch. You should\u0027ve seen her when she first showed up, Roy. She was exactly like a lost kitten in search of a home.\" \"Where is she now?\" \"At work.\" Apparently Hannah was more than a visitor. Roy reached inside his shirt pocket for a pad and pen. \"She has a job?\" Peggy nodded again. \"This is her first day, and she was really worried about it. She\u0027s washing dishes at the PancakePalace.\" Peggy frowned slightly. \"I\u0027d hoped for something better, but she was quite certain this job suited her. Unfortunately, she doesn\u0027t have much self-confidence.\" Roy recalled his phone conversation with Hannah and remembered how timid her voice had been. \"She\u0027s due back any time. I\u0027m curious as to how her first day went.\" \"I\u0027d like to ask her a couple more questions if you don\u0027t mind?\" \"Not at all, although Bob\u0027s going to be disappointed if he misses you.\" Peggy picked up her glass of lemonade and took a drink. \"Did he mention he got the lead in Chicago? He\u0027s pretty pleased with himself, so if he has a swelled head when you see him, that\u0027s why.\" She smiled as she said it. \"Good for him,\" he murmured. Peggy looked proud of her husband, Roy thought, as well she should. \"I saw him in A Christmas Carol last December and I was really impressed.\" \"He played four roles in that, including Marley with the clanking chains. The costumes were so good I didn\u0027t recognize him at first.\" Roy chuckled and noticed a battered blue Honda pulling into the driveway. \"That\u0027s Hannah now,\" Peggy told him. She stood and walked over to the door off the kitchen. When the girl came into the house, her eyes immediately went to Roy. She offered him a brief smile. \"How was work?\" Peggy asked her. She gently placed one arm around Hannah\u0027s shoulders. Hannah shrugged. \"All right, I guess.\" \"Do you remember Mr. McAfee?\" she asked. Hannah\u0027s brow furrowed slightly. \"You\u0027re the private investigator who called me, aren\u0027t you?\" \"I am, and I have a few more questions for you. Is that all right?\" She shrugged a second time. \"I suppose so, although I\u0027m pretty tired at the moment.\" Peggy got a fresh glass, filled it with lemonade and set it on the table. \"I\u0027ll leave you two alone to talk. If you need anything, just give a holler. I\u0027ll be out in my garden.\" It looked as if Hannah was about to ask Peggy to stay, but she seemed to find sufficient resolve in herself to face Roy on her own. She sat at the table, resting her clasped hands on the place mat. With her lank hair drawn into a ponytail and her eyes lowered, she resembled a shy schoolgirl. \"What would you like to ask me?\" she mumbled. Roy\u0027s question had to do with Samuels. Some of the facts didn\u0027t fit together in his mind. \"I was wondering if you know anything about Colonel Samuels visiting California.\" \"To see my father, you mean?\" she asked, glancing up. Roy nodded encouragingly. \"To the best of your knowledge, do you remember ever seeing him with your father?\" She hesitated. \"Yes, now that you mention it, he did come to see my dad once.\" Roy frowned as he scanned his notes. \"I see I asked this question earlier and you claimed you\u0027d never met Colonel Samuels.\" \"I didn\u0027t personally meet him,\" Hannah rushed to explain. \"But I did see him with my father.\" \"When was that?\" She narrowed her eyes. \"It must\u0027ve been shortly before Dad left for Cedar Cove—yes, it was only a few days beforehand.\" \"Was your father agitated?\" \"Not really. Why do you ask?\" \"No reason,\" Roy said lightly. \"Is there anything else I can help you with?\" she asked and he had the feeling she was eager for the questioning to be over. \"Not right now. I need to sort out a few things first. Will I be able to reach you here?\" \"I should be around for a while. The Beldons said I could live with them for the time being. I... I probably shouldn\u0027t, but they make it so easy.\" She lowered her eyes again. \"They really are wonderful people.\" Roy agreed with her there. \"Thank you for your time, Hannah.\" \"You\u0027re welcome.\" Roy stood, ready to go, when he saw that Bob\u0027s car was turning into the driveway. Walking out of the kitchen, Roy waited until he\u0027d parked in the garage. Bob had opened the trunk, removed his golf clubs and put them away before he noticed Roy. \"Good to see you, Roy,\" he said as he emerged from the garage. \"Actually I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here. I need to ask a favor.\" \"Ask away.\" \"I mentioned that my car\u0027s being worked on next week, didn\u0027t I?\" Roy nodded. \"Peggy\u0027s got a meeting with her garden club Tuesday night. Is there any chance I can take you up on your offer and borrow your car while mine\u0027s in the shop? I\u0027ll have it back first thing in the morning.\" \"No problem.\" Because Corrie and Roy worked together, her car sat at home most days. \"I appreciate it.\" \"I can drop it off Monday evening, if you\u0027d like.\" \"Perfect,\" Bob said happily. \"Why don\u0027t you and Corrie come for dinner that night?\" \"Sounds good, but I\u0027d better check with the boss.\" Corrie was the one who kept their social calendar and there\u0027d be hell to pay if he agreed to dinner without clearing it with her beforehand. \"You do that, and get back to me.\" Roy left for his office a few minutes later. He collected the mail on his way in and dumped it on his desk. Corrie generally dealt with the mail before he saw it, but she was gone for the afternoon. It was a lazy day following the Fourth of July weekend, and they weren\u0027t completely back on schedule yet. As he sorted through the bills, flyers and letters, Roy placed the bills in one basket and the personal stuff on Corrie\u0027s desk. A postcard caught his attention. It was a plain white one, the kind available at the post office for the price of the stamp. He turned it over and read the message twice. EVERYONE HAS REGRETS. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU\u0027VE DONE YOU WISH YOU COULD DO OVER? THINK ABOUT IT. There was no signature. Roy set the card on his desk, staring at it for a long moment. Living the life he had, there were always regrets and misgivings. If someone was asking for a list, he wouldn\u0027t know where to start.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-21.html","bookId":1944,"book":{"id":1944,"title":"44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4)","description":"Storyline: 44 Cranberry Point (Cedar Cove #4) Dear Reader, I love living in Cedar Cove, but things haven\u0027t been the same since a man died at our B and B.
