{"id":37674,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 4: An Appointment.","content":"Soon after ten, next morning, Gregory took up his place near the entrance to Lord Cromer\u0027s house. It was just eleven when Mr. Murray came down. \"Come in with me,\" he said. \"Lord Cromer will see you. He acknowledged at once, when I told him your story, that you had a strong claim for employment. The only point was as to your age. I told him that you were past sixteen, and a strong, active fellow, and that you had had a good physical training.\" They had now entered the house. \"Don\u0027t be nervous, Hilliard; just talk to him as you would to me. Many a good man has lost an appointment, from being nervous and embarrassed when he applied for it.\" \"You want to go up to the Soudan?\" Lord Cromer said. \"Mr. Murray has told me your reasons for wanting to go. Though I fear it is hardly likely that any new light can be thrown upon the fate of Hicks Pasha, and his officers, I feel that it is a natural desire on your part.\" \"It was my mother\u0027s last wish, sir, and she took particular pains in my training, and education, to fit me for the work.\" \"You speak Arabic, and the tongue of the Negro blacks, almost as well as English?\" \"Yes, sir. Arabic quite as well, and the other nearly as well, I think.\" \"What sort of post did you hope to get, Mr. Hilliard?\" \"Any post for which I may be thought fit, sir. I do not care at all about pay. My mother saved sufficient to keep me for two or three years. I would rather enlist than not go up at all, though I fear I am too young to be accepted; but I am quite ready to turn my hand to anything.\" \"If it concerned the Egyptian government, or a civil appointment, I would certainly exert my influence in your favour; but this expedition is in the hands of the military. However, if you will take a seat in the anteroom, and do not mind waiting there for an hour or two, I will see what can be done.\" \"Thank you very much indeed, sir.\" Mr. Murray, as they went out together, said: \"I think that you have made a good impression. He told me, before, that it was a matter for Sir Herbert Kitchener, and that he was expecting him in a quarter of an hour. Come and tell me the result, when you leave.\" Ten minutes later, a tall man, whom Gregory recognized at once as Sir Herbert Kitchener, whose figure was well known in Cairo, passed through the room; all who were sitting there rising to their feet, as he did so. He acknowledged the salute mechanically, as if scarcely conscious of it. An hour later a bell was rung, and an attendant went into the room. He returned directly. \"Mr. Hilliard,\" he said. Gregory rose, and passed through the door held open. Kitchener was sitting at the table with Lord Cromer. His keen glance seemed, to Gregory, to take him in from head to foot, and then to look at something far beyond him. His keen glance seemed to Gregory to take him in from head to foot \"This is Mr. Hilliard,\" Lord Cromer said, \"the young gentleman I have spoken of.\" \"You want to go up?\" the general said shortly, in Arabic. \"Yes, sir.\" \"You do not mind in what capacity you go?\" \"No, sir; I am ready to do anything.\" \"To work on the railway, or in the transport?\" \"Yes, sir. Though I would rather not be on the railway, for the railway cannot get on as fast as the troops; but I would enlist in one of the English regiments, if they would take me.\" \"And you speak the language of the Nubian blacks?\" The question was put in that language. \"Yes; I do not think I speak it quite as well as Arabic, but I speak it fairly.\" \"Do you think that you could stand the fatigue?--no child\u0027s play, you know.\" \"I can only say that I hope I can, sir. I have been accustomed to take long walks, and spend an hour a day in gymnastic exercises, and I have had lessons in fencing.\" \"Can you use a pistol?\" \"Yes, fairly; I have practised a good deal with it.\" \"You are most fitted for an interpreter,\" the general said, speaking this time in English. \"Now the North Staffordshire have come down, there are no British regiments up there, and of course the British officers in the Egyptian army all speak Arabic, to some extent. However, I will send you up to Dongola. Either General Hunter, or Colonel Wingate, of the Intelligence Department, may be able to find some use for you; and when the British troops go up, you can be attached to one of their regiments as their interpreter. You will have temporary rank of lieutenant, with, of course, the pay of that rank. \"Captain Ewart came with me, Lord Cromer. I left him in the anteroom. If you will allow me, I will call him in. \"Captain Ewart,\" he said, as that officer entered, \"Mr. Hilliard here has just received the temporary rank of lieutenant, in the Egyptian army, and is going up to join General Hunter, at Dongola. You are starting in three days, are you not? \"I shall be glad if you will take him under your wing, as far as you go. He speaks the languages, Negro as well as Arabic. You can tell him what kit he had better take, and generally mother him. \"That is all, Mr. Hilliard. Call at my quarters, the day after tomorrow, for the letters for General Hunter and Colonel Wingate.\" \"I thank you most deeply, sir,\" Gregory began, but the Sirdar gave a little impatient wave with his hand. \"Thank you most deeply also, Lord Cromer!\" Gregory said with a bow, and then left the room. Captain Ewart remained there for another ten minutes. When he came out, he nodded to Gregory. \"Will you come with me?\" he said. \"I am going to the bank. I shall not be there many minutes, and we can then have a talk together.\" \"Thank you, sir! I am going to the bank too. It was Mr. Murray who first spoke to Lord Cromer about me.\" \"You could not have had a better introduction. Well, you won\u0027t have very long to get ready for the start--that is, if you have not begun to prepare for it. However, there is no rush at present, therefore I have no doubt you will be able to get your khaki uniforms in time. As for other things, there will be no difficulty about them.\" \"You have been up at the front before, sir?\" \"Yes, my work is on the railway. I had a touch of fever, and got leave to come down and recruit, before the hot weather came in. I dare say you think it hot here, sometimes, but this is an ice house in comparison with the desert.\" They talked until they arrived at the bank. \"You may as well go in first, and see Murray. I suppose you won\u0027t be above two or three minutes. I shall be longer, perhaps a quarter of an hour; so if you wait for me, we will go to Shepherd\u0027s, and talk your business over in some sort of comfort.\" \"I am pleased, indeed,\" Mr. Murray said, when Gregory told him of his appointment. \"It is better than I even hoped. It is bad enough there, in the position of an officer, but it would be infinitely worse in any other capacity. Do you want to draw any money?\" \"No, sir; I have fifty pounds by me, and that will be enough, I should think, for everything.\" \"More than ample. Of course, you have plenty of light underclothing of all sorts, and a couple of suits of khaki will not cost you anything like so much as they would, if you got them at a military tailor\u0027s in London. However, if you want more, you will be able to draw it.\" \"Thank you very much, sir! I will not detain you any longer, now; but will, if you will allow me, come in to say goodbye before I start. Captain Ewart is waiting to speak to you. He came with me from Lord Cromer\u0027s.\" Captain Ewart then went in, and after settling the business on which he had come, asked Mr. Murray questions about Gregory, and received a sketch of his story. \"He seems to be a fine young fellow,\" he said, \"well grown and active, not at all what one would expect from a product of Cairo.\" \"No, indeed. Of course, you have not seen him to advantage, in that black suit, but in his ordinary clothes I should certainly take him, if I had not seen him before, to be a young lieutenant freshly come out to join.\" \"Did you know the father?\" \"No, I was not here at that time; but the mother was a lady, every inch. It is strange that neither of them should have friends in England. It may be that she preferred to earn her living here, and be altogether independent.\" \"She had a pension, hadn\u0027t she?\" \"A small one, but she really earned her living by teaching. She gave lessons to the ladies in English, French, and music, and had classes for young boys and girls. I once asked her if she did not intend to go back and settle in England, and she said \u0027Possibly, some day.\u0027 \"I fancy that there must have been some mystery about the affair--what, I can\u0027t say; but at any rate, we may take it that such a woman would not have married a man who was not a gentleman.\" \"Certainly the boy looks a well-bred one,\" Captain Ewart said, \"and I am sure that the Sirdar must have been taken with him. You don\u0027t know any more about his father than you have told me?\" \"Very little. Once, in talking with his wife, she told me that her husband had been in a commercial house, in Alexandria, for a year; but the place was burned down at the time of the bombardment. Being thus out of harness, he became an assistant to one of the army contractors and, when things settled down at Cairo, obtained a berth as interpreter, with the temporary rank of captain, on Hicks Pasha\u0027s staff, as he also spoke Arabic fluently. I can tell you no more about him than that, as I never saw him; though no doubt he came here with his wife, when her account was opened. \"I was interested in her. I looked up the old books, and found that two hundred pounds was paid into her account, before he left. I may say that she steadily increased that amount, ever since; but a few years ago she had the sum then standing transferred to the boy\u0027s name, telling me frankly, at the time, that she did so to save trouble, in case anything happened to her. I fancy, from what she said, that for the last year or two she had been going downhill. I had a chat with her, the last time she came in. She told me that she had been consumptive, and that it was for the sake of her health they came out here.\" \"That accounts for it, Murray. By the date, they were probably only married a year or so before they came out; and a man who loved a young wife, and saw no other way of saving her, would throw up any berth at home, in order to give her the benefit of a warm climate. Still, it is a little curious that, if he had only been out here a year or so before Hicks started, he should have learned Arabic sufficiently well to get a post as interpreter. I have been in the country about three years, and can get on fairly well with the natives, in matters concerning my own work; but I certainly could not act as general interpreter. \"Well, I am glad to have heard this, for you know the sort of men interpreters generally are. From the lad\u0027s appearance and manner, there is no shadow of doubt that his mother was a lady. I thought it more than probable that she had married beneath her, and that her husband was of the ordinary interpreter class. Now, from what you have said, I see that it is probable he came of a much better family. Well, you may be sure that I shall do what I can for the lad.\" Gregory joined him, as he left the bank. \"I think, Hilliard, we had best go to the tailor, first. His shop is not far from here. As you want to get your things in three days, it is as well to have that matter settled, at once.\" The two suits, each consisting of khaki tunic, breeches, and putties, were ordered. \"You had better have breeches,\" he said. \"It is likely you will have to ride, and knickerbockers look baggy.\" This done, they went to Shepherd\u0027s Hotel. \"Sit down in the verandah,\" Captain Ewart said, \"until I get rid of my regimentals. Even a khaki tunic is not an admirable garment, when one wants to be cool and comfortable.\" In a few minutes he came down again, in a light tweed suit; and, seating himself in another lounging chair, two cooling drinks were brought in; then he said: \"Now we will talk about your outfit, and what you had best take up. Of course, you have got light underclothing, so you need not bother about that. You want ankle boots--and high ones--to keep out the sand. You had better take a couple of pairs of slippers, they are of immense comfort at the end of the day; also a light cap, to slip on when you are going from one tent to another, after dark. A helmet is a good thing in many ways, but it is cumbrous; and if there are four or five men in a tent, and they all take off their helmets, it is difficult to know where to stow them away. \"Most likely you will get a tent at Dongola, but you can\u0027t always reckon upon that, and you may find it very useful to have a light tente d\u0027abri made. It should have a fly, which is useful in two ways. In the first place, it adds to the height and so enlarges the space inside; and in the next place, you can tie it up in the daytime, and allow whatever air there is to pass through. Then, with a blanket thrown over the top, you will find it cooler than a regimental tent. \"Of course, you will want a sword and a revolver, with a case and belt. Get the regulation size, and a hundred rounds of cartridges; you are not likely ever to use a quarter of that number, but they will come in for practice. \"Now, as to food. Of course you get beef, biscuit, or bread, and there is a certain amount of tea, but nothing like enough for a thirsty climate, especially when--which is sometimes the case--the water is so bad that it is not safe to drink, unless it has been boiled; so you had better take up four or five pounds of tea.\" \"I don\u0027t take sugar, sir.\" \"All the better. There is no better drink than tea, poured out and left to cool, and drunk without sugar. You might take a dozen tins of preserved milk, as many of condensed cocoa and milk, and a couple of dozen pots of jam. Of course, you could not take all these things on if you were likely to move, but you may be at Dongola some time, before there is another advance, and you may as well make yourself as comfortable as you can; and if, as is probable, you cannot take the pots up with you, you can hand them over to those who are left behind. You will have no trouble in getting a fair-sized case taken up, as there will be water carriage nearly all the way. \"A good many fellows have aerated waters sent up, but hot soda water is by no means a desirable drink--not to be compared with tea kept in porous jars; so I should not advise you to bother about it. You will want a water bottle. Get the largest you can find. It is astonishing how much water a fellow can get down, in a long day\u0027s march. \"Oh! As to your boots, get the uppers as light as you can--the lighter the better; but you must have strong soles--there are rocks in some places, and they cut the soles to pieces, in no time. The sand is bad enough. Your foot sinks in it, and it seems to have a sort of sucking action, and very often takes the sole right off in a very short time. \"I suppose you smoke?\" \"Cigarettes, sir.\" \"I should advise you to get a pipe, in addition, or rather two or three of them. If they get broken, or lost in the sand, there is no replacing them; and if you don\u0027t take to them, yourself, you will find them the most welcome present you can give, to a man who has lost his. \"I should advise you to get a lens. You don\u0027t want a valuable one, but the larger the better, and the cheapest that you can buy; it will be quite as good as the best, to use as a burning glass. Matches are precious things out there and, with a burning glass, you will only have to draw upon your stock in the evening. \"Now, do you ride? Because all the white officers with the Egyptian troops do so.\" \"I am sorry to say that I don\u0027t, sir. I have ridden donkeys, but anyone can sit upon a donkey.\" \"Yes; that won\u0027t help you much. Then I should advise you to use all the time that you can spare, after ordering your outfit, in riding. No doubt you could hire a horse.\" \"Yes; there is no difficulty about that.\" \"Well, if you will hire one, and come round here at six o\u0027clock tomorrow morning, I will ride out for a couple of hours with you, and give you your first lesson. I can borrow a horse from one of the staff. If you once get to sit your horse, in a workman-like fashion, and to carry yourself well, you will soon pick up the rest; and if you go out, morning and evening, for three hours each time, you won\u0027t be quite abroad, when you start to keep up with a column of men on foot. \"As to a horse, it would be hardly worth your while to bother about taking one with you. You will be able to pick one up at Dongola. I hear that fugitives are constantly coming in there, and some of them are sure to be mounted. However, you had better take up a saddle and bridle with you. You might as well get an Egyptian one; in the first place because it is a good deal cheaper, and in the second because our English saddles are made for bigger horses. You need not mind much about the appearance of your animal. Anything will do for riding about at Dongola, and learning to keep your seat. In the first fight you have with Dervish horsemen, there are sure to be some riderless horses, and you may then get a good one, for a pound or two, from some Tommy who has captured one.\" \"I am sure I am immensely obliged to you, Captain Ewart. That will indeed be an advantage to me.\" On leaving the hotel Gregory at once made all his purchases, so as to get them off his mind; and then arranged for the horse in the morning. Then he went home, and told the old servant the change that had taken place in his position. \"And now, what about yourself, what would you like to do?\" \"I am too old to go up with you, and cook for you.\" \"Yes, indeed,\" he laughed; \"we shall be doing long marches. But it is not your age, so much. As an officer, it would be impossible for me to have a female servant. Besides, you want quiet and rest. I have been round to the landlord, to tell him that I am going away, and to pay him a month\u0027s rent, instead of notice. I should think the best way would be for you to take a large room for yourself, or two rooms not so large--one of them for you to live in, and the other to store everything there is here. I know that you will look after them, and keep them well. Of course, you will pick out all the things that you can use in your room. It will be very lonely for you, living all by yourself, but you know numbers of people here; and you might engage a girl to stay with you, for some small wages and her food. Now, you must think over what your food and hers will cost, and the rent. Of course, I want you to live comfortably; you have always been a friend rather than a servant, and my mother had the greatest trust in you.\" \"You are very good, Master Gregory. While you have been away, today, I have been thinking over what I should do, when you went away. I have a friend who comes in, once a week, with fruit and vegetables. Last year, you know, I went out with her and stayed a day. She has two boys who work in the garden, and a girl. She came in today, and I said to her: \"\u0027My young master is going away to the Soudan. What do you say to my coming and living with you, when he has gone? I can cook, and do all about the house, and help a little in the garden; and I have saved enough money to pay for my share of food.\u0027 \"She said, \u0027I should like that, very well. You could help the boys, in the field.\u0027 \"So we agreed that, if you were willing, I should go. I thought of the furniture; but if you do not come back here to live, it would be no use to keep the chairs, and tables, and beds, and things. We can put all Missy\u0027s things, and everything you like to keep, into a great box, and I could take them with me; or you could have them placed with some honest man, who would only charge very little, for storage.\" \"Well, I do think that would be a good plan, if you like these people. It would be far better than living by yourself. However, of course I shall pay for your board, and I shall leave money with you; so that, if you are not comfortable there, you can do as I said, take a room here. \"I think you are right about the furniture. How would you sell it?\" \"There are plenty of Greek shops. They would buy it all. They would not give as much as you gave for it. Most of them are great rascals.\" \"We cannot help that,\" he said. \"I should have to sell them when I come back and, at any rate, we save the rent for housing them. They are not worth much. You may take anything you like, a comfortable chair and a bed, some cooking things, and so on, and sell the rest for anything you can get, after I have gone. I will pack my dear mother\u0027s things, this evening.\" For the next two days, Gregory almost lived on horseback; arranging, with the man from whom he hired the animals, that he should change them three times a day. He laid aside his black clothes, and took to a white flannel suit, with a black ribbon round his straw hat; as deep mourning would be terribly hot, and altogether unsuited for riding. \"You will do, lad,\" Captain Ewart said to him, after giving him his first lesson. \"Your fencing has done much for you, and has given you an easy poise of body and head. Always remember that it is upon balancing the body that you should depend for your seat; although, of course, the grip of the knees does a good deal. Also remember, always, to keep your feet straight; nothing is so awkward as turned-out toes. Besides, in that position, if the horse starts you are very likely to dig your spurs into him. \"Hold the reins firmly, but don\u0027t pull at his head. Give him enough scope to toss his head if he wants to, but be in readiness to tighten the reins in an instant, if necessary.\" Each day, Gregory returned home so stiff, and tired, that he could scarcely crawl along. Still, he felt that he had made a good deal of progress; and that, when he got up to Dongola, he would be able to mount and ride out without exciting derision. On the morning of the day on which he was to start, he went to say goodbye to Mr. Murray. \"Have you everything ready, Hilliard?\" the banker asked. \"Yes, sir. The uniform and the tent are both ready. I have a cork bed, and waterproof sheet to lay under it; and, I think, everything that I can possibly require. I am to meet Captain Ewart at the railway, this afternoon at five o\u0027clock. The train starts at half past. \"I will draw another twenty-five pounds, sir. I have not spent more than half what I had, but I must leave some money with our old servant. I shall have to buy a horse, too, when I get up to Dongola, and I may have other expenses, that I cannot foresee.\" \"I think that is a wise plan,\" the banker said. \"It is always well to have money with you, for no one can say what may happen. Your horse may get shot or founder, and you may have to buy another. Well, I wish you every luck, lad, and a safe return.\" \"Thank you very much, Mr. Murray! All this good fortune has come to me, entirely through your kindness. I cannot say how grateful I feel to you.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3122/85870.html","bookId":902,"book":{"id":902,"title":"With Kitchener in the Soudan","description":"简介： The reconquest of the Soudan will ever be mentioned as one of the most difficult, and at the same time the most successful, enterprises ever undertaken.
