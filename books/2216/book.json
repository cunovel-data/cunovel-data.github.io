{"id":2216,"title":"The Devil May Care (Mac McKenzie #11)","description":"Storyline: Riley Brodin is the granddaughter of Walter Muehlenhaus - a man as rich, powerful, and connected as anyone since the days of J. P. Morgan. Despite her family\u0027s connections, it\u0027s McKenzie she reaches out to when her relatively new boyfriend goes missing. Despite his reservations about getting involved with the Muehlenhaus family - again - McKenzie agrees to look for one Juan Carlos Navarre. What he finds, though, is a man who appears to be a ghost. The house - mansion, really - he told Riley he owned is actually a rental, barely lived in and practically devoid of personal effects. The restaurant he claimed to own is owned by another and Navarre merely an investor. He apparently has no friends, no traceable past, and McKenzie isn\u0027t the only one looking for him. Whoever Juan Carlos Navarre is and wherever he\u0027s gone, the one thing that is clear is that he\u0027s trouble, and is perhaps someone - as Riley\u0027s family makes clear-better out of the picture. Unfortunately for everyone, McKenzie likes trouble and trouble likes him.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-devil-may-care-mac-mckenzie-11.jpg","author":"David Housewright","type":"Thriller","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":12,"name":"Thriller","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
