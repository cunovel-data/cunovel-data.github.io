{"id":110825,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Just before the telephone rang, storm winds toppled the tree outside her window and jolted Miss Keene from her dreaming sleep. She flung herself up with a gasp, her frail hands crumpling twists of sheet in either palm. Beneath her flesh-less chest the heart jerked taut, the sluggish blood spurted. She sat in rigid muteness, her eyes staring at the night.\\n\\n In another second, the telephone rang.\\n\\n Who on earth? The question shaped unwittingly in her brain. Her thin hand faltered in the darkness, the fingers searching a moment and then Miss Elva Keene drew the cool receiver to her ear.\\n\\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Outside a cannon of thunder shook the night, twitching Miss Keene\u0027s crippled legs. I\u0027ve missed the voice, she thought, the thunder has blotted out the voice.\\n\\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 she said again.\\n\\n There was no sound. Miss Keene waited in expectant lethargy. Then she repeated, \u0027Hel-lo,\u0027 in a cracking voice. Outside the thunder crashed again.\\n\\n Still no voice spoke, not even the sound of a phone being disconnected met her ears. Her wavering hand reached out and thumped down the receiver with an angry motion.\\n\\n \u0027Inconsideration,\u0027 she muttered, thudding back on her pillow. Already her infirm back ached from the effort of sitting.\\n\\n She forced out a weary breath. Now she\u0027d have to suffer through the whole tormenting process of going to sleep again �C the composing of jaded muscles, the ignoring of abrasive pain in her legs, the endless, frustrating struggle to turn off the faucet in her brain and keep unwanted thoughts from dripping. Oh, well, it had to be done; Nurse Phillips insisted on proper rest. Elva Keene breathed slowly and deeply, drew the covers to her chin and laboured hopefully for sleep.\\n\\n In vain.\\n\\n Her eyes opened and, turning her face to the window, she watched the storm move off on lightning legs. Why can\u0027t I sleep, she fretted, why must I always lie here awake like this?\\n\\n She knew the answer without effort. When a life was dull, the smallest element added seemed unnaturally intriguing. And life for Miss Keene was the sorry pattern of lying flat\u0027 or being propped on pillows, reading books which Nurse Phillips brought from the town library, getting nourishment, rest, medication, listening to her tiny radio �C and waiting, waiting for something different to happen.\\n\\n Like the telephone call that wasn\u0027t a call.\\n\\n There hadn\u0027t even been the sound of a receiver replaced in its cradle. Miss Keene didn\u0027t understand that. Why would anyone call her exchange and then listen silently while she said \u0027Hello,\u0027 over and over again? Had it actually been anyone calling?\\n\\n What she should have done, she realised then, was to keep listening until the other person tired of the joke and put down the receiver. What she should have done was to speak out forcefully about the inconsideration of a prankish call to a crippled maiden lady, in the middle of a stormy night. Then, if there had been someone listening, whoever it was would have been properly chastened by her angry words and...\\n\\n \u0027Well, of course.\u0027\\n\\n She said it aloud in the darkness, punctuating the sentence with a cluck of somewhat relieved disgust. Of course, the telephone was out of order. Someone had tried to contact her, perhaps Nurse Phillips to see if she was all right. But the other end of the line had broken down in some way, allowing her phone to ring but no verbal communication to be made. Well, of course, that was the case.\\n\\n Miss Keene nodded once and closed her eyes gently. Now to sleep, she thought. Far away, beyond the county, the storm cleared its murky throat. I hope no one is worrying, Elva Keene thought, that would be too bad.\\n\\n She was thinking that when the telephone rang again.\\n\\n There, she thought, they are trying to reach me again. She reached out hurriedly in the darkness, fumbled until she felt the receiver, then pulled it to her ear.\\n\\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 said Miss Keene.\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n Her throat contracted. She knew what was wrong, of course, but she didn\u0027t like it, no, not at all.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027 she said tentatively, not yet certain that she was wasting breath.\\n\\n There was no reply. She waited a moment, then spoke a third time, a little impatient now, loudly, her shrill voice ringing in the dark bedroom. \u0027Hello!\u0027\\n\\n Nothing. Miss Keene had the sudden urge to fling, the receiver away. She forced down that curious instinct �C no, she must wait; wait and listen to hear if anyone hung up the phone on the other end of the line.\\n\\n So she waited.\\n\\n The bedroom was very quiet now, but Elva Keene kept straining to hear; either the sound of a receiver going down or the buzz which usually follows. Her chest rose and fell in delicate lurches, she closed her eyes in concentration, then opened them again and blinked at the darkness. There was no sound from the telephone; not a click, not a buzz, not a sound of someone putting down a receiver.\\n\\n \u0027Hello!\u0027 she cried suddenly, then pushed away the receiver.\\n\\n She missed her target. The receiver dropped and thumped once on the rug. Miss Keene nervously clicked on the lamp, wincing as the leprous bulb light filled her eyes. Quickly, she lay on her side and tried to reach the silent, voiceless telephone.\\n\\n But she couldn\u0027t stretch far enough and crippled legs prevented her from rising. Her throat tightened. My God, must she leave it there all night, silent and mystifying.\\n\\n Remembering then, she reached out abruptly and pressed the cradle arm. On the floor, the receiver clicked, then began to buzz normally. Elva Keene swallowed and drew in a shaking breath as she slumped back on her pillow.\\n\\n She threw out hooks of reason then and pulled herself back from panic. This is ridiculous, she thought, getting upset over such a trivial and easily explained incident. It was the storm, the night, the way in which I\u0027d been shocked from sleep. (What was it that had awakened me?) AH these things piled on the mountain of teeth-grinding monotony that\u0027s my life. Yes, it was bad, very bad. But it wasn\u0027t the incident that was bad. It was her reaction to it.\\n\\n Miss Elva Keen numbed herself to further premonitions. \u0027I shall sleep now\u0027 she ordered her body with a petulant shake. She lay very still and relaxed. From the floor she could hear the telephone buzzing like the drone of far-off bees. She ignored it.\\n\\n Early the next morning, after Nurse Phillips had taken away the breakfast dishes, Elva Keen called the telephone company.\\n\\n This is Miss Elva,\u0027 she told the operator.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes, Miss Elva,\u0027 said the operator, a Miss Finch. \u0027Can I help you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Last night my telephone rang twice,\u0027 said Elva Keene. \u0027But when I answered it, no one spoke. And I didn\u0027t hear any receiver drop. I didn\u0027t even hear a dial tone �C just silence.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027ll tell you, Miss Elva,\u0027 said the cheery voice of Miss Finch, \u0027that storm last night just about ruined half our service. We\u0027re being flooded with calls about knocked down lines and bad connections. I\u0027d say you\u0027re pretty lucky your phone is working at all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then you think it was probably a bad connection,\u0027 prompted Miss Keene, \u0027caused by the storm?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes, Miss Elva, that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you think it will happen again?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, it may,\u0027 said Miss Finch. \u0027It may. I really couldn\u0027t tell you, Miss Elva. But if it does happen again, you just call me and then I\u0027ll have one of our men check on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 said Miss Elva. \u0027Thank you, dear.\u0027\\n\\n She lay on her pillows all morning in a relaxed torpor. It gives one a satisfied feeling, she thought, to solve a mystery, slight as it is. It had been a terrible storm that caused the bad connection. And no wonder when it had even knocked down the ancient oak-tree beside the house. That was the noise that had awakened me of course, and a pity it was that the dear tree had fallen. How it shaded the house in hot summer months. Oh, well, I suppose I should be grateful, she thought, that the tree fell across the road and not across the house.\\n\\n The day passed uneventfully, an amalgam of eating, reading Angela Thirkell and the mail (two throw-away advertisements and the light bill), plus brief chats with Nurse Phillips. Indeed, routine had set in so properly that when the telephone rang early that evening, she picked it up without even thinking.\\n\\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n It brought her back for a second. Then she called Nurse Phillips.\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 asked the portly woman as she trudged across the bedroom rug.\\n\\n \u0027This is what I was telling you about,\u0027 said Elva Keene, holding out the receiver. \u0027Listen!\u0027\\n\\n Nurse Phillips took the receiver in her hand and pushed back grey locks with the earpiece. Her placid face remained placid. \u0027There\u0027s nobody there,\u0027 she observed.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Miss Keene. \u0027That\u0027s right. Now you just listen and see if you can hear a receiver being put down. I\u0027m sure you won\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n Nurse Phillips listened for a moment, then shook her head. \u0027I don\u0027t hear anything,\u0027 she said and hung up.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, wait!\u0027 Miss Keene said hurriedly. \u0027Oh, well, it doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 she added, seeing it was already down. \u0027If it happens too often, I\u0027ll just call Miss Finch and they\u0027ll have a repairman check on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 Nurse Phillips said and went back to the living room and Faith Baldwin.\\n\\n Nurse Phillips left the house at eight, leaving on the bedside table, as usual, an apple, a cookie, a glass of water and the bottle of pills. She puffed up the pillows behind Miss Keene\u0027s fragile back, moved the radio and telephone a little closer to the bed, looked around complacently, then turned for the door, saying, I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\u0027\\n\\n It was fifteen minutes later when the telephone rang. Miss Keene picked up the receiver quickly. She didn\u0027t bother saying hello this time �C she just listened.\\n\\n At first it was the same �C an absolute silence. She listened a moment more, impatiently. Then, on the verge of replacing the receiver, she heard the sound. Her cheek twitched, she jerked the telephone back to her ear.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027 she asked tensely.\\n\\n A murmuring, a dull humming, a rustling sound �C what was it? Miss Keene shut her eyes tightly, listening hard, but she couldn\u0027t identify the sound; it was too soft, too undefined, it deviated from a sort of whining vibration... to an escape of air... to a bubbling sibilance. It must be the sound of the connection, she thought, it must be the tele-phone itself making the noise. Perhaps a wire blowing in the wind somewhere, perhaps...\\n\\n She stopped thinking then. She stopped breathing. The sound had ceased. Once more, silence rang in her ears. She could feel the heartbeats stumbling in her chest again, the walls of her throat closing in. Oh, this is ridiculous, she told herself. I\u0027ve already been through this - it was the storm, the storm!\\n\\n She lay back on her pillows, the receiver pressed to her ear, nervous breaths faltering from her nostrils. She could feel unreasoning dread rise like a tide within her, despite all attempts at sane deduction. Her mind kept slipping off the glassy perch of reason; she kept falling deeper and deeper.\\n\\n Now she shuddered violently as the sounds began again. They couldn\u0027t possibly be human sounds, she knew, and yet there was something about them, some inflection, some almost identifiable arrangement of...\\n\\n Her lips shook and a whine began to hover in her throat. But she couldn\u0027t put down the telephone, she simply couldn\u0027t. The sounds held her hypnotised. Whether they were the rise and fall of the wind or the muttering of faulty mechanisms, she didn\u0027t know, but they would not let her go.\\n\\n \u0027Hello ?\u0027 she murmured, shakily.\\n\\n The sounds rose in volume. They rattled and shook in her brain.\\n\\n \u0027Hello!\u0027 she screamed.\\n\\n \u0027H-e-l~l-o,\u0027 answered a voice on the telephone. Then Miss Keene fainted dead away.\\n\\n \u0027Are you certain it was someone saying hello?\u0027 Miss Finch asked Miss Elva over the telephone. \u0027It might have been the connection, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I tell you it was a man!\u0027 a shaking Elva Keene screeched. \u0027It was the same man who kept listening to me say hello over and over and over again without answering me back. The same one who made terrible noises over the telephone!\u0027\\n\\n Miss Finch cleared her throat politely. \u0027Well, I\u0027ll have a man check your line, Miss Elva, as soon as he can. Of course, the men are very busy now with all the repairs on storm wreckage, but as soon as it\u0027s possible...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what am I going to do if this �C this person calls again?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You just hang up on him, Miss Elva.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he keeps calling!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well.\u0027 Miss Finch\u0027s affability wavered. \u0027Why don\u0027t you find out who he is, Miss Elva? If you can do that, why, we can take immediate action, you see and\\n\\n After she\u0027d hung up, Miss Keene lay against the pillows tensely, listening to Nurse Phillips sing husky love songs over the breakfast dishes. Miss Finch didn\u0027t believe her story, that was apparent. Miss Finch thought she was a nervous old woman falling prey to imagination. Well, Miss Finch would find out differently.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll just keep calling her and calling her until she does,\u0027 she said irritably to Nurse Phillips just before afternoon nap.\\n\\n \u0027You just do that,\u0027 said Nurse Phillips. \u0027Now take your pill and lie down,\u0027\\n\\n Miss Keene lay in grumpy silence, her vein-rutted hands knotted at her sides. It was ten after two and, except for the bubbling of Nurse Phillips\u0027s front room snores, the house was silent in the October afternoon. It makes me angry, thought Elva Keene, that no one will take this seriously. Well - her thin lips pressed together �C the next time the telephone rings I\u0027ll make sure that Nurse Phillips listens until she does hear something.\\n\\n Exactly then the phone rang.\\n\\n Miss Keene felt a cold tremor lace down her body. Even in the daylight with sunbeams speckling her flowered coverlet, the strident ringing frightened her. She dug porcelain teeth into her lower lip to steady it. Shall 1 answer it? the question came and then, before she could even think to answer, her hand picked up the receiver. A deep ragged breath; she drew the phone slowly to her ear. She said, \u0027Hello? \u0027\\n\\n The voice answered back, \u0027Hello?\u0027 �C hollow and inanimate.\\n\\n \u0027Who is this?\u0027 Miss Keene asked, trying to keep her throat clear.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s calling, please?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is anyone there!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Please ... !\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027\\n\\n Miss Keene jammed down the receiver and lay on her bed trembling violently, unable to catch her breath. What is it, begged her mind, what in God\u0027s name is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Margaret!\u0027 she cried. \u0027Margaret!\u0027\\n\\n In the front room she heard Nurse Phillips grunt abruptly and then start coughing.\\n\\n \u0027Margaret, please...!\u0027\\n\\n Elva Keene heard the large bodied woman rise to her feet and trudge across the living room floor. I must compose my-sell, she told herself, fluttering hands to her fevered cheeks. I must tell her exactly what happened, exactly.\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 grumbled the nurse. \u0027Does your stomach ache?\u0027\\n\\n Miss Keene\u0027s throat drew in tautly as she swallowed. \u0027He just called again,\u0027 she whispered.\\n\\n \u0027Who?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That man!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What Man?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The one who keeps calling!\u0027 Miss Keene cried. \u0027He keeps saying hello over and over again. That\u0027s all he says �C hello, hello, hel -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Now stop this,\u0027 Nurse Phillips scolded stolidly. Tie back and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to lie back!\u0027 she said frenziedly. \u0027I want to know who this terrible person is who keeps frightening me!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Now don\u0027t work yourself into a state,\u0027 warned Nurse Phillips. \u0027You know how upset your stomach gets.\u0027\\n\\n Miss Keene began to sob bitterly. \u0027I\u0027m afraid. I\u0027m afraid of him. Why does he keep calling me?\u0027\\n\\n Nurse Phillips stood by the bed looking down in bovine inertia. \u0027Now, what did Miss Finch tell you?\u0027 she said softly.\\n\\n Miss Keene\u0027s shaking lips could not frame the answer.\\n\\n \u0027Did she tell you it was the connection?\u0027 the nurse soothed. \u0027Did she?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it isn\u0027t! It\u0027s a man, a man!\u0027\\n\\n Nurse Phillips expelled a patient breath. \u0027If it\u0027s a man,\u0027 she said, \u0027then just hang up. You don\u0027t have to talk to him. Just hang up. Is that so hard to do?\u0027\\n\\n Miss Keene shut tear-bright eyes and forced her lips into a twitching line. In her mind the man\u0027s subdued and listless voice kept echoing. Over and over, the inflection never altering, the question never deferring to her replies �C just repeating itself endlessly in doleful apathy. Hello? Hello? Making her shudder to the heart.\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 Nurse Phillips spoke.\\n\\n She opened her eyes and saw the blurred image of the nurse putting the receiver down on the table.\\n\\n \u0027There,\u0027 Nurse Phillips said, \u0027nobody can call you now. You leave it that way. If you need anything all you have to do is dial. Now isn\u0027t that all right? Isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n Miss Keene looked bleakly at the nurse. Then, after a moment, she nodded once. Grudgingly.\\n\\n She lay in the dark bedroom, the sound of the dial tone humming in her ear; keeping her awake. Or am I just telling myself that? she thought. Is it really keeping me awake? Didn\u0027t I sleep that first night with the receiver off the hook? No, it wasn\u0027t the sound, it was something else.\\n\\n She closed her eyes obdurately. I won\u0027t listen, she told herself, I just won\u0027t listen to it. She drew in trembling breaths of the night. But the darkness would not fill her brain and blot away the sound.\\n\\n Miss Keene felt around on the bed until she found her bed jacket. She draped it over the receiver, swathing its black smoothness in woolly turns. Then she sank back again, stern breathed and taut. I will sleep, she demanded, I will sleep.\\n\\n She heard it still.\\n\\n Her body grew rigid and abruptly, she unfolded the receiver from its thick wrappings and slammed it down angrily on the cradle. Silence filled the room with delicious peace. Miss Keene fell back on the pillow with a feeble groan. Now to sleep, she thought.\\n\\n And the telephone rang.\\n\\n Her breath snuffed off. The ringing seemed to permeate the darkness, surrounding her in a cloud of ear-lancing vibration. She reached out to put the receiver on the table again, then jerked her hand back with a gasp, realising she would hear the man\u0027s voice again.\\n\\n Her throat pulsed nervously. What I\u0027ll do, she planned, what I\u0027ll do is take off the receiver very quickly - very quickly �C and put it down, then push down on the arm and cut off the line. Yes, that\u0027s what I\u0027ll do!\\n\\n She tensed herself and spread her hand out cautiously until the ringing phone was under it. Then, breath held, she followed her plan, slashed off the ring, reached quickly for the cradle arm...\\n\\n And stopped, frozen, as the man\u0027s voice reached out through the darkness to her ears. Where are you?\u0027 he asked. \u0027I want to talk to you.\u0027\\n\\n Claws of ice clamped down on Miss Keene\u0027s shuddering chest. She lay petrified, unable to cut off the sound of the man\u0027s dull, expressionless voice, asking, Where are you? I want to talk to you.\u0027\\n\\n A sound from Miss Keene\u0027s throat, thin and fluttering.\\n\\n And the man said, \u0027Where are you? I want to talk to you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no,\u0027 sobbed Miss Keene.\\n\\n \u0027Where are you? I want to...\u0027\\n\\n She pressed the cradle arm with taut white fingers. She held it down for fifteen minutes before letting it go.\\n\\n \u0027I tell you I won\u0027t have it!\u0027\\n\\n Miss Keene\u0027s voice was a frayed ribbon of sound. She sat inflexibly on the bed, straining her frightened anger through the mouthpiece vents.\\n\\n \u0027You say you hang up on this man and he still calls?\u0027 Miss Finch inquired.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve explained all that!\u0027 Elva Keene burst out. \u0027I had to leave the receiver off the phone all night so he wouldn\u0027t call. And the buzzing kept me awake. I didn\u0027t get a wink of sleep! Now, I want this line checked, do you hear me? I want you to stop this terrible thing!\u0027\\n\\n Her eyes were like hard, dark beads. The phone almost slipped from her palsied fingers.\\n\\n \u0027All right, Miss Elva,\u0027 said the operator. \u0027I\u0027ll send a man out today.\u0027\\n\\n Thank you, dear, thank you,\u0027 Miss Keene said. \u0027Will you call me when\\n\\n Her voice stopped abruptly as a clicking sound started on the telephone.\\n\\n \u0027The line is busy,\u0027 she announced.\\n\\n The clicking stopped and she went on. To repeat, will you let me know when you find out who this terrible person is V\\n\\n \u0027Surely, Miss Elva, surely. And I\u0027ll have a man check your telephone this afternoon. You\u0027re at 127 Mill Lane, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s right, dear. You will see to it, won\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I promise faithfully, Miss Elva. First thing today.\u0027\\n\\n Thank you, dear,\u0027 Miss Keene said, drawing in relieved breath.\\n\\n There were no calls from the man all that morning, none that afternoon. Her tightness slowly began to loosen. She played a game of cribbage with Nurse Phillips and even managed a little laughter. It was comforting to know that the telephone company was working on it now. They\u0027d soon catch that awful man and bring back her peace of mind.\\n\\n But when two o\u0027clock came, then three o\u0027clock �C and still no repairman at her house �C Miss Keene began worrying again.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter with that girl?\u0027 she said pettishly. \u0027She promised me faithfully that a man would come this afternoon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027ll be here,\u0027 Nurse Phillips said. \u0027Be patient.\u0027\\n\\n Four o\u0027clock arrived and no man. Miss Keene would not play cribbage, read her book or listen to her radio. What had begun to loosen was tightening again, increasing minute by minute until at five o\u0027clock, when the telephone rang, her hand spurted out rigidly from the flaring sleeve of her bed jacket and clamped down like a claw on the receiver. If the man speaks, raced her mind, if he speaks I\u0027ll scream until my heart stops.\\n\\n She pulled the receiver to her ear. \u0027Hello?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Miss Elva, this is Miss Finch.\u0027\\n\\n Her eyes closed and breath fluttered through her lips. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027About those calls you say you\u0027ve been receiving.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 In her mind, Miss Finch\u0027s words cutting �C \u0027those calls you say you\u0027ve been receiving.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We sent a man out to trace them,\u0027 continued Miss Finch. \u0027I have his report here.\u0027\\n\\n Miss Keene caught her breath. \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He couldn\u0027t find anything.\u0027\\n\\n Elva Keene didn\u0027t speak. Her grey head lay motionless on the pillow, the receiver pressed to her ear.\\n\\n \u0027He says he traced the �C the difficulty to a fallen wire on the edge of town.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fallen wire?\u0027\\n\\n Yes, Miss Elva.\u0027 Miss Finch did not sound happy,\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re telling me I didn\u0027t hear anything?\u0027\\n\\n Miss Finch\u0027s voice was firm. \u0027There\u0027s no way anyone could have phoned you from that location,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027I tell you a man called me!\u0027\\n\\n Miss Finch was silent and Miss Keene\u0027s fingers tightened convulsively on the receiver.\\n\\n \u0027There must be a phone there,\u0027 she insisted. \u0027There must be some way that man was able to call me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Miss Elva, the wire is lying on the ground.\u0027 She paused. \u0027Tomorrow, our crew will put it back up and you won\u0027t be...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There has to be a way he could call me!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Miss Elva, there\u0027s no one out there!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Out where, where?\u0027\\n\\n The operator said, \u0027Miss Elva, it\u0027s the cemetery.\u0027\\n\\n In the black silence of her bedroom, a crippled maiden lady lay waiting. Her nurse would not remain for the night; her nurse had patted her and scolded her and ignored her.\\n\\n She was waiting for a telephone call.\\n\\n She could have disconnected the phone, but she had not the will. She lay there waiting, waiting, thinking.\\n\\n Of the silence �C of ears that had not heard, seeking to hear again. Of sounds bubbling and muttering �C the first stumbling attempts at speech by one who had not spoken �C how long? Of �C hello ? hello ? �C first greeting by one long silent. Of -where are you ?
