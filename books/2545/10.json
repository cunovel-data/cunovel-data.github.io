Until then his desk was snow-banked with demanding papers, his telephone rang constantly and an army of insistent visitors attacked his walls. By twelve, his nerves were pulled like violin strings knobbed to their tightest. By one, the strings drew close to shearing; by one-thirty they began to snap. He had to get away; now, immediately; flee to some shadowy restaurant booth, have a cocktail and a leisurely meal; listen to somnolent music. He had to.\n Down on the street, he walked beyond the zone of eating places he usually frequented, not wishing to risk seeing anyone he knew. About a quarter of a mile from the office he found a cellar restaurant named Franco\u0027s. At his request, the hostess led him to a rear booth where he ordered a martini; then, as the woman turned away, he stretched out his legs beneath the table and closed his eyes. A grateful sigh murmured from him. This was the ticket. Dim-lit comfort. Muzak thrumming at the bottom fringe of audibility, a curative drink. He signed again. A few more days like this, he thought, and I\u0027m gone.\n \u0027Hi, Don.\u0027\n He opened his eyes in time to see the man drop down across from him, \u0027How goes it?\u0027 asked the man.\n \u0027What?\u0027 Donald Marshall stared at him.\n \u0027Gawd,\u0027 said the man. \u0027What a day, what a day.\u0027 He grinned tiredly. \u0027You, too?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe -\u0027 began Marshall.\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 the man said, nodding, pleased, as a waitress brought the martini. \u0027That for me. Another, please; dryer than dry.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 said the waitress and was gone.\n \u0027There,\u0027 said the man, stretching. \u0027No place like Franco\u0027s for getting away from it all, eh?\u0027\n \u0027Look here,\u0027 said Marshall, smiling awkwardly. \u0027I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ve made a mistake.\u0027\n \u0027Hmmm?\u0027 The man leaned forward, smiling back.\n T say I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ve made a mistake.\u0027\n \u0027I have?\u0027 The man grunted. \u0027What\u0027d I do, forget to shave? I\u0027m liable to. No?\u0027 he said as Marshall frowned. \u0027Wrong tie?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t understand,\u0027 said Marshall.\n What?\u0027\n Marshall cleared his throat. \u0027I\u0027m �C not who you think I am,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Huh?\u0027 The man leaned forward again, squinting. He straightened up, chuckling. \u0027What\u0027s the story, Don?\u0027 he asked.\n Marshall fingered at the stem of his glass. \u0027Yes, what is the story?\u0027 he said, less politely now.\n \u0027I don\u0027t get you,\u0027 said the man.\n \u0027Who do you think I am?\u0027 asked Marshall, his voice rising a little.\n The man began to speak, gaped a trifle, then began to speak again. \u0027What do you mean who do I -?\u0027 He broke off as the waitress brought the second martini. They both sat quietly until she was gone.\n \u0027Now,\u0027 said the man curiously.\n \u0027Look, I\u0027m not going to accuse you of anything,\u0027 said Marshall, \u0027but you don\u0027t know me. You\u0027ve never met me in your whole life.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t -!\u0027 The man couldn\u0027t finish; he looked flabbergasted. \u0027I don\u0027t know you?\u0027 he said.\n Marshall had to laugh. \u0027Oh this is ludicrous,\u0027 he said.\n The man smiled appreciatively. \u0027I knew you were ribbing me,\u0027 he admitted, \u0027but �C \u0027 He shook his head. \u0027You had me going there for a second.\u0027\n Marshall put down his glass, the skin beginning to tighten across his cheeks.\n Td say this had gone about far enough,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m in no mood for -\u0027\n \u0027Don,\u0027 the man broke in. \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\n Marshall drew in a deep breath, then let it waver out. \u0027Oh, well,\u0027 he said, \u0027I suppose it\u0027s an honest mistake.\u0027 He forced a smile. \u0027Who do you think I am?\u0027\n The man didn\u0027t answer. He looked at Marshall intently.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 asked Marshall, beginning to lose patience.\n \u0027This isn\u0027t a joke?\u0027 said the man,\n \u0027Now, look -\u0027\n \u0027No, wait, wait,\u0027 the man said, raising one hand. \u0027I... suppose it\u0027s possible there could be two men who look so much alike they -\u0027\n He stopped abruptly and looked at Marshall. \u0027Don, you\u0027re not ribbing me, are you?\u0027\n \u0027Now listen to me -!\u0027\n \u0027All right, I apologise,\u0027 said the man. He sat gazing at Marshall for a moment; then he shrugged and smiled perplexedly. \u0027I could have sworn you were Don Marshall,\u0027 he said.\n Marshall felt something cold gathering around his heart.\n \u0027I am,\u0027 he heard himself say.\n The only sound in the restaurant was that of the music and the delicate clink of silverware.\n \u0027What is this?\u0027 asked the man.\n \u0027You tell me,\u0027 said Marshall in a thin voice.\n \u0027You �C \u0027 The man looked carefully at him. \u0027This is not a joke,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Now see here!\u0027\n \u0027All right, all right, The man raised both his hands in a conciliatory gesture. \u0027It\u0027s not a joke. You claim I don\u0027t know you. All right. Granting that leaves us with �C with this: a man who not only looks exactly like my friend but has exactly the same name. Is this possible?\u0027\n \u0027Apparently so,\u0027 said Marshall.\n Abruptly, he picked up his glass and took momentary escape in the martini. The man did the same. The waitress came for their orders and Marshall told her to come back later.\n \u0027 What\u0027s your name?\u0027 he asked then.\n \u0027Arthur Nolan,\u0027 said the man.\n Marshall gestured conclusively. \u0027I don\u0027t know you,\u0027 he said. There was a slight loosening of tension in his stomach.\n The man leaned back and stared at Marshall. This is fantastic,\u0027 he said. He shook his head. \u0027Utterly fantastic\u0027\n Marshall smiled and lowered his eyes to the glass.\n \u0027Where do you work?\u0027 asked the man.\n \u0027American-Pacific Steamship,\u0027 Marshall answered, glancing up. He felt the beginning of enjoyment in himself. This was, certainly, something to take one\u0027s mind off the wrack of the day.\n The man looked examiningly at him; and Marshall sensed the enjoyment fading.\n Suddenly the man laughed.\n \u0027You must have had one sweet hell of a morning, buddy,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027No more,\u0027 said the man.\n \u0027Listen -\u0027\n \u0027I capitulate,\u0027 said Nolan, grinning. \u0027You\u0027re curdling my gin.\u0027\n \u0027Listen to me, damn it!\u0027 snapped Marshall.\n The man looked startled. His mouth fell open and he put his drink down. \u0027Don, what is it?\u0027 he asked, concerned now.\n \u0027You do not know me,\u0027 said Marshall, very carefully. \u0027I do not know you. Will you kindly accept that?\u0027\n The man looked around as if for help. Then he leaned in close and spoke, his voice soft and worried.\n \u0027Don, listen. Honestly. You don\u0027t know me?\u0027\n Marshall drew in a deep breath, teeth clenched against rising fury. The man drew back. The look on his face was, suddenly, frightening to Marshall.\n \u0027One of us is out of his mind,\u0027 Marshall said. The levity he\u0027d intended never appeared in his voice.\n Nolan swallowed raggedly. He looked down at his drink as if unable to face the other man.\n Marshall suddenly laughed. \u0027Dear Lord,\u0027 he said, \u0027What a scene. You really think you know me, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n The man grimaced. The Don Marshall I know,\u0027 he said, \u0027also works for American-Pacific.\u0027\n Marshall shuddered. That\u0027s impossible,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027No,\u0027 said the man flatly.\n For a moment Marshall got the notion that this was some sort of insidious plot against him; but the distraught expression on the man\u0027s face weakened the suspicion. He took a sip of his martini, then, carefully, set down the glass and laid his palms on the table as if seeking the reinforcement of its presence.\n \u0027American-Pacific Steamship Lines?\u0027 he asked.\n The man nodded once. \u0027Yes.\u0027\n Marshall shook his head obdurately; \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027There\u0027s no other Marshall in our offices. Unless,\u0027 he added, quickly, \u0027one of our clerks downstairs -\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re an- \u0027 The man broke off nervously. \u0027He\u0027s an executive,\u0027 he said.\n Marshall drew his hands in slowly and put them in his lap. Then I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 he said. He wished, instantly, he hadn\u0027t said it.\n This... man told you he worked there?\u0027 he asked quickly.\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Can you prove he works there?\u0027 Marshall challenged, his voice breaking, \u0027Can you prove his name is really Don Marshall?\u0027\n \u0027Don, I -\u0027\n \u0027Well, can you?\u0027\n \u0027Are you married?\u0027 asked the man.\n Marshall hesitated. Then, clearing his throat, he said, \u0027I am.\u0027\n Nolan leaned forward. To Ruth Foster?\u0027 he asked.\n Marshall couldn\u0027t hide his involuntary gasp.\n \u0027Do you live on the Island?\u0027 Nolan pressed.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Marshall weakly, \u0027but -\u0027\n \u0027In Huntington?\u0027\n Marshall hadn\u0027t even the strength to nod.\n \u0027Did you go to Columbia University?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but -\u0027 His teeth were on edge now.\n \u0027Did you graduate in June, nineteen forty?\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 Marshall clutched at this. \u0027I graduated in January, nineteen forty-one. Forty-one!\u0027\n \u0027Were you a lieutenant in the Army?\u0027 asked Nolan, paying no attention.\n Marshall felt himself slipping. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he muttered, \u0027but you said -\u0027\n \u0027In the Eighty-Seventh Division?\u0027\n \u0027Now wait a minute!\u0027 Marshall pushed aside the nearly empty glass as if to make room for his rebuttal. \u0027I can give you two very good explanations for this... this fool confusion.\n One: a man who looks like me and knows a few things about me is pretending to be me; Lord knows why.\n Two: you know about me and you\u0027re trying to snare me into something. No, you can argue all you like!\u0027 he persisted, almost frantically, as the man began to object. \u0027You can ask all the questions you like; but I know who I am and I know who I know!\u0027\n \u0027Do you?\u0027 asked the man. He looked dazed.\n Marshall felt his legs twitch sharply.\n \u0027Well, I have no intention of s-sitting here and arguing with you,\u0027 he said. \u0027This entire thing is absurd. I came here for some peace and quiet �C a place I\u0027ve never even been to before and -\u0027\n \u0027Don, we eat here all the time.\u0027 Nolan looked sick.\n That\u0027s nonsense!\u0027\n Nolan rubbed a hand across his mouth. \u0027You... you actually think this is some kind of con game?\u0027 he asked.\n Marshall stared at him. He could feel the heavy pulsing of his heart.\n \u0027Or that �C my God - that there\u0027s a man impersonating you? Don...\u0027 The man lowered his eyes. T think �C well, if I were you/ he said quietly, \u0027I\u0027d �C go to a doctor, a -\u0027\n \u0027Let\u0027s stop this, shall we?\u0027 Marshall interrupted coldly. \u0027I suggest one of us leave.\u0027 He looked around the restaurant. \u0027There\u0027s plenty of room in here.\u0027\n He turned his eyes quickly from the man\u0027s stricken face and picked up his martini. \u0027Well?\u0027 he said.\n The man shook his head. \u0027Dear God,\u0027 he murmured.\n \u0027I said let\u0027s stop it,\u0027 Marshall said through clenched teeth.\n \u0027That\u0027s it?\u0027 asked Nolan, incredulously. \u0027You\u0027re willing to -to let it go at that?\u0027\n Marshall started to get up.\n \u0027No, no, wait,\u0027 said Nolan. TU go.\u0027 He stared at Marshall blankly. \u0027I\u0027ll go,\u0027 he repeated.\n Abruptly, he pushed to his feet as if there were a leaden mantle around his shoulders.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what to say,\u0027 he said, \u0027but �C for God\u0027s sake, Don �C see a doctor.\u0027\n He stood by the side of the booth a moment longer, looking down at Marshall. Then, hastily, he turned and walked towards the front door. Marshall watched him leave.\n When the man had gone he sank back against the booth wall and stared into his drink. He picked up the toothpick and mechanically stirred the impaled onion around in the glass. When the waitress came he ordered the first item he saw on the menu.\n While he ate he thought about how insane it had been. For, unless the man Nolan was a consummate actor, he had been sincerely upset by what had happened.\n What had happened? An out-and-out case of mistaken identity was one thing. A mistaken identity which seemed not quite wholly mistaken was another. How had the man known these things about him? About Ruth, Huntington, American-Pacific, even his lieutenancy in the 87th Division? How?\n Suddenly, it struck him.\n Years ago he\u0027d been a devotee of fantastic fiction �C stories which dealt with trips to the moon, with travelling through time, with all of that. And one of the ideas used repeatedly was that of the alternate universe: a lunatic theory which stated that for every possibility there was a separate universe. Following his theory there might, conceivably, be a universe in which he knew this Nolan, ate at Franco\u0027s with him regularly and had graduated from Columbia a semester earlier.\n It was absurd, really, yet there it was. What if, in entering Franco\u0027s, he had, accidentally, entered a universe one jot removed from the one he\u0027d existed in at the office? What if, the thought expanded, people were, without knowing it, continually entering these universes one jot removed? What if he himself had continually entered them and never known until today �C when, in an accidental entry, he had gone one step too far?\n He closed his eyes and shuddered. Dear Lord, he thought; dear, heavenly Lord, I have been working too hard. He felt as if he were standing at the edge of a cliff waiting for someone to push him off. He tried hard not to think about his talk with Nolan. If he thought about it he\u0027d have to fit into the pattern. He wasn\u0027t prepared to do that yet.\n After a while he paid his check and left the restaurant, the food like cold lead in his stomach. He cabbed to Pennsylvania Station and, after a short wait, boarded a North Shore train. All the way to Huntington, he sat in the smoker car staring out at the passing countryside, an unlit cigarette between his fingers. The heavy pressure in his stomach wouldn\u0027t go away.\n When Huntington was reached, he walked across the station to the cab stand and, deliberately, got into one of them.\n Take me home, will you?\u0027 he looked intently at the driver.\n \u0027Sure thing, Mr Marshall,\u0027 said the driver, smiling.\n Marshall sank back with a wavering sigh and closed his eyes. There was a tingling at his fingertips.\n \u0027You\u0027re home early,\u0027 said the driver. \u0027Feeling poorly?\u0027\n Marshall swallowed. \u0027Just a headache,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Oh, I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\n As he rode home, Marshall kept staring at the town, despite himself, looking for discrepancies, for differences. But there were none; everything was just the same. He felt the pressure letting up.\n Ruth was in the living room, sewing.\n \u0027Don.\u0027 She stood up and hurried to him. \u0027Is something wrong?\u0027\n \u0027No, no,\u0027 he said putting down his hat. \u0027Just a headache.\u0027\n \u0027Oh.\u0027 She led him, sympathetically, to a chair and helped him off with his suit coat and shoes. \u0027I\u0027ll get you something right away,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Fine.\u0027 When she was gone upstairs, Marshall looked around the familiar room and smiled at it. It was all right now.\n Ruth was coming down the stairs when the telephone rang. He started up, then fell back again as she called, \u0027I\u0027ll get it, darling.\u0027\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said.\n He watched her in the hallway as she picked up the receiver and said hello. She listened. \u0027Yes, darling,\u0027 she said automatically. \u0027You -\u0027\n Then she stopped and, holding out the receiver, stared at it as if it were something monstrous in her hand.\n She put it back-to her ear. \u0027You... won\u0027t be home until late?\u0027 she asked in a faint voice.\n Marshall sat there gaping at her, the beats of his heart like someone striking at him. Even when she turned to look at him, the receiver lowered in her hand, he couldn\u0027t turn away. Please, he thought. Please don\u0027t say it. Please.\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 she asked. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shock/page-10.html","bookId":2545,"book":{"id":2545,"title":"Shock","description":"Storyline: \n 13 Tales of Sheer Terror\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shock.jpg","author":"Richard Matheson","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/shock.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:51 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:08:02 AM"}}
