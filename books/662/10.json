{"id":44491,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X.","content":"George stayed at Whittington for a week; he followed his father to the grave. Mrs. Staunton clung to him with a sort of feverish tenacity; whenever he came into the room, her eyes followed him. A sort of wistful, contented expression came into them when he sat down beside her. During all the time George was in the house she never broke down. At last, however, the time came when he must leave her. \n \n \"I must go back to my work,\" he said; \"but you are coming to London soon, then I\u0027ll be with you every evening. You know my father has given you to me to take care of. It will be all right when we are in London together.\" \n \n \"Yes, my boy,\" she replied, \"it will be all right then. I don\u0027t complain,\" she added; \"I don\u0027t attempt to murmur. I shall go to him, but he cannot return to me; and I have got you, George, and he gave me to you. I am willing to stay with you just as long as you want me.\"78 \n \n It was late that night when George left his mother\u0027s room. Effie was standing in the passage—the brother and sister looked at each other. Effie had come home the day after Dr. Staunton\u0027s death. \n \n \"Come out with me for a bit, Effie,\" said her brother. They went into the garden, and she linked her hand through his arm. \n \n Dorothy Fraser had now returned to her duties in London; the Stauntons were to go up to town as soon as ever the cottage could be sold. It had belonged to the doctor. George was to live with them when they were in town, and perhaps Effie would be able to follow the great wish of her mind. There was just a possibility that she might be able to be trained as a hospital nurse. She looked up at George now. \n \n \"You have been such a comfort to us,\" she said. \"Dorothy told me everything; and I know that if you had not come just at the opportune moment, we should have lost our mother as well as our father. I\u0027ll do all in my power to hurry matters, so that we can come to London before the winter.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said George. He was a finely built young fellow, with a handsome face. He was not the least like Effie, who was dark and rather small, like her mother. George had the doctor\u0027s physique; he had great square shoulders, his eyes were frank and blue like his father\u0027s, but his mouth wanted his father\u0027s firmness. \n \n \"Effie,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know how I am to bring myself to confide in you.\" \n \n \"Confide in me?\" she said, with a little start. \"We always did tell our secrets to one another, but all this terrible trouble seems to have put childish things away. Have you really a secret, George, to tell me?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know how I can tell it to you,\" he replied;79 his lips quivered—he looked down. Effie clasped his arm affectionately. \n \n \"You know I would do anything for you,\" she said. \n \n \"Yes; I know you are the best of girls, and you\u0027re awfully pretty, too. I know Fred Lawson will think so when he sees you.\" \n \n \"Who is he?\" \n \n \"A friend of mine—a right good fellow—he is a medical student at St. Joseph\u0027s Hospital. I have often met him, and he has talked to me about his own sisters, and one day I showed him your photograph, and he said what a pretty girl you were. Somehow, Effie, I never thought of you as pretty until Fred said so. I suppose fellows don\u0027t think how their sisters look, although they love them very dearly; but when Fred said it, it opened my eyes. Dear, dear, why am I talking like this, when time is so precious, and I—Effie, when I came down that day to see my father, I was in trouble—great trouble; the shock of seeing him seemed to banish it from my mind, but it cannot be banished—it cannot be banished, Effie, and I have no one to confide in now but you.\" \n \n \"You must tell me of course,\" said Effie; she felt herself turning pale. She could not imagine what George\u0027s trouble was. The night was dusk; she raised her eyes to her brother\u0027s face—he avoided meeting them. He had a stick in his hand, and he began to poke holes in the gravel. \n \n \"How much money have we got to live on?\" he asked abruptly. \n \n \"How much money have we to live on?\" repeated Effie. \"I believe, when all is collected, that there will be something like a hundred a year for mother and Agnes and Katie and the two little children.80 Of course I am going to support myself somehow, and you are naturally off our hands.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s awful,\" said George; \"it\u0027s awful to be so starvingly poor as that. Why, I get a hundred a year now; fancy five people living on a sum on which I never can make both ends meet!\" \n \n \"What is the matter with you, George? How queerly you speak! You knew we should be awfully poor when father died. You are going to pay for your board, are you not, when you come to us, and that will be a great help.\" \n \n \"Yes, of course; I vow and declare that I\u0027ll give mother at least half of what I earn.\" \n \n \"Well, that will be fifty pounds—a great help. My idea for myself is—but——\" Effie stopped abruptly. She saw that George was making an impatient movement. \"I\u0027ll tell you another time,\" she said in a gentle voice. \"You have something now to tell me, have you not?\" \n \n \"I have—God knows I have. I want to get two hundred and fifty pounds somewhere.\" \n \n \"Two hundred and fifty pounds!\" exclaimed Effie. George might just as well have asked her for the moon. \n \n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" she said, after a pause. \n \n \"No, and I never want you to, Effie,\" replied the young man. \"I can\u0027t tell you what I want the money for, but it\u0027s a matter of life and death. I thought I had made up my mind\"—a husky sound came into his throat—\"I made up my mind to tell everything to my father when I came down that night—I could have told him. It was not a sort of thing to talk to you about, but I thought I could tell him; he died, and he gave me mother. He left mother with me. You know perfectly well, Effie, that our mother\u0027s life hangs on a thread. You know she must not have a shock, and yet—Effie, Effie, if I don\u0027t get that ￡250, she will have such a shock, such a terrible shock, that it will send her to her grave!\" \n \n \"I must think,\" said Effie. \"I cannot answer you in a moment.\" \n \n \"Is there no earthly way you can help me? I must be helped,\" said George in a frantic voice. \"I have got six weeks longer—I must get that ￡250 in six weeks, or—no, I can\u0027t tell you.\" \n \n \"Yes, you must try—I won\u0027t help you unless you try.\" \n \n \"Well, then—here goes. If I don\u0027t get it, I shall have to go to—prison.\" George\u0027s voice sank to a hoarse whisper. \n \n Effie could not suppress a cry. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1497/44726.html","bookId":662,"book":{"id":662,"title":"A Girl in Ten Thousand","description":"简介： The speaker was a middle-aged woman.
