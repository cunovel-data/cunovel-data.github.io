{"id":44492,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI.","content":"\"Then you have done something wrong,\" said Effie, loosening her hold of her brother\u0027s arm and backing to a little distance. He could scarcely see her face in the ever increasing darkness, but he noticed the change in her voice. There was an indignant note of pained and astonished youth in it. Effie had never come face to face with the graver sins of life; the word \"prison\" stunned her, she forgot pity for a moment in indignation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"George,\" she said, with a sort of gasp, \"father left mother to you,—in a sort of way he gave her up to you,—and you have done wrong; you have sinned.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You talk just like a girl,\" said George; \"you jump at conclusions. You, an innocent girl living in the shelter of home, know as little about the temptations which we young fellows have to meet out in82 the world, as you know of the heavens above you. My God! Effie, it is a hard world—it is hard, hard to keep straight in it. Yes, I have done wrong—I know it—and father gave mother to me. If you turn away from me, Effie, I shall go to the bad—I shall go to the worst of all; there will not be a chance for me if you turn from me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The tone of despair in his voice changed Effie\u0027s frame of mind in a moment. She ran up to him and put her arms round his neck. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I won\u0027t turn from you, poor George,\" she said. \"It did shock me for a moment—it frightened me rather more than I can express; but perhaps I did not hear you aright, perhaps you did not say the word \u0027prison.\u0027 You don\u0027t mean to say that unless you get that impossible sum of money you will have to go to prison, George?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Before God, it is true,\" said George. \"I cannot, I won\u0027t tell you why, but it is as true as I stand here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you will kill our mother,\" said Effie. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And father left her to you. George, it cannot be. I must think of something—my head is giddy—we have not any money to spare. It will be the hardest fight in the world to keep the children from starvation on that hundred pounds a year, but something must be done. I\u0027ll go and speak to the trustees.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who are the trustees?\" asked George. He rose again to his feet. There was a dull sort of patience in his words. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Watson is one,—you know the Watsons, father has always been so good to them,—and our clergyman, Mr. Jellet, is the other. Yes, I must go and speak to them; but what am I to say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must not betray me,\" said George. \"If you mention that I want the money, all will be up with83 me. In any case, there may be suspicion. Men of the world like Mr. Watson and Mr. Jellet would immediately guess there was something wrong if a lad required such a large sum of money. You must not tell them that I want it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can I help it? Oh, everything is swimming round before my eyes; I feel as if my head would burst.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Think of me,\" said George—\"think of the load I have got to bear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Effie glanced up at him. His attitude and his words puzzled and almost revolted her. After a time she said coldly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What hour are you leaving in the morning?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I want to catch the six-o\u0027clock train to town. This is good-by, Effie; I shan\u0027t see you before I go. Remember, there are six weeks before anything can happen. If anyone can save me, you can. It is worth a sacrifice to keep our mother from dying.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, it would kill her,\" said Effie. \"Good-night now, George. I cannot think nor counsel you at present; I feel too stunned. The blow you have given me has come so unexpectedly, and it—it is so awful. But I\u0027ll get up to see you off in the morning. Some thought may occur to me during the night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well,\" said George. He walked slowly down the garden, and, entering the house, went up to his own room. Effie did not go in for a long time. She was alone now, all alone with the stars. She was standing in the middle of the path. Often and often her father\u0027s steps had trodden this path. He used to pace here when he was troubled about a sick patient, when his anxiety about her mother arose to a feverish pitch. Now his daughter stood on the same spot, while a whirl of troubled thoughts passed84 through her brain. It had been her one comfort, since that awful moment when Dorothy had told her that her father was gone, to feel that George, in a measure at least, took that father\u0027s place. \\n\\n \\n\\n George had always been her favorite brother; they were very nearly the same age—Effie was only two years younger than George; long ago George had been good to the little sister—they had never quarreled, they had grown up always the best and warmest of friends. Their love had been true—as true as anything in all the world. \\n\\n \\n\\n George had gone to London, and the first tiny spark of discontent had visited Effie\u0027s heart. She would be so lonely without her brother. It was so fine for him to go out into life, her own horizon seemed so narrow. Then Dorothy came, and they had made friends, and Dorothy told her what some women did with their lives. \\n\\n \\n\\n Effie had been fired with a sudden desire to follow in Dorothy\u0027s steps; then had followed the dark cloud which seemed to swallow up her wishes, and all that was best out of her life. George, at least, remained. Dear, brave, manly George! The brother who had passed out of childhood, and entered man\u0027s estate. \\n\\n \\n\\n Her father\u0027s last message had been to George—he had given her precious mother into George\u0027s care. \\n\\n \\n\\n It seemed to Effie to-night, standing out under the stars, as if George, too, were dead. The old George was really dead, and a stranger had taken his place. This stranger wore the outward guise of her brother—he had his eyes, his figure; his voice had the same tone, he could look at you just in George\u0027s way, but he could utter terrible words which George had never known anything about. He could talk of sin and prison. He could propose that Effie should rescue him at the risk of her mother\u0027s85 livelihood. Oh, what did it mean? How was she to bear it?—how could she bear it? She clasped her hands, tears filled her eyes, but she was too oppressed, too pained, too stunned to weep long. Presently she went into the house, and lay down on her bed without undressing. \\n\\n \\n\\n During the whole of that terrible night Effie scarcely slept. It was the worst night in all her life. Toward morning she dozed a little, but sprang up with a start, fearing that George had gone to London without seeing her. For her mother\u0027s sake she must see him. Whatever happened, her mother must never know of this calamity. Effie got up, washed her hands and face, smoothed out her hair, and went downstairs. George was already up, he was standing in the little parlor. He turned round when he heard his sister\u0027s footsteps, and looked anxiously at her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What a brute I am!\" he said, when he saw the expression on her face; \"but I swear before God, Effie, if you will help me, I\u0027ll turn over a new leaf; I\u0027ll never do a wrong thing again as long as I live—I swear it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t swear it,\" said Effie; \"it seems to make it worse to do that. If you did wrong once, you may again. Don\u0027t swear. Ask God to help you. I don\u0027t know that I have been praying all night, but I have been trying to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Effie, what have you determined to do?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is there no one else who can help you, George?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a soul; I have only one friend, and that is Fred Lawson.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes! I remember you spoke of him last night. Would he help you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He help me!\" said George, with a hysterical laugh. \"Why, he is the chap I have wronged.86 There, don\u0027t ask me any more. If you can help me, I am saved; if you can\u0027t, say so, and I\u0027ll go straight to destruction.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, you shan\u0027t do that, George. I have thought of something—nothing may come of it, but I\u0027m going to try. It is terribly repugnant to me, but I would sacrifice much to save my mother. If it fails, all fails.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have thought,\" said George eagerly, \"that, as the case is such an extreme one, we might take some of the capital. There is a thousand pounds; a quarter of that sum would put me right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It cannot be done for a moment,\" said Effie, her face flushing hotly. \"That money must under no circumstances be touched; my mother and the children depend on it for their bread.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what is to be done, then,\" said George in a hopeless voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must trust to me, George; I am going to try to help you in my own way. If I fail, I fail; but somehow I don\u0027t think I shall. If I have any news I will write to you soon; and now good-by, good-by.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George turned and kissed Effie; she gave him her cheek, but her lips did not touch his. She was willing to help him, but her love for the time was dead or dying. \\n\\n \\n\\n The young man walked hurriedly down the village street. Effie stood in the porch and watched him; his shoulders were bowed, he stooped. George used to have a fine figure; Effie used to be proud of him—she was not proud of her brother now. \\n\\n \\n\\n She went back to the house, and sat down listlessly for a time in the little parlor—her hands were folded in her lap. It seemed to her as if the end of all things had come.87 \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently the sound of the children\u0027s voices overhead aroused her; she went upstairs, and helped Susan to dress them. Returning to the everyday duties of life had a soothing effect upon her. She made a violent effort and managed to put her trouble behind her for the time being. Whatever happened, her mother must not see any traces of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the baby was dressed, she took him as usual to her mother\u0027s room. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Staunton sat up in bed and stretched out her arms to receive him. Effie gave him to her mother, who began to kiss his little face hungrily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has George gone, Effie?\" said the mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, mother, dear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did anyone see him off—did he have his breakfast?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, he had a good breakfast; I got it ready for him last night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But did anyone see him off?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I did.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right; I should not have liked him to have had his last meal by himself. I miss him awfully. Effie, dear, how soon do you think we can go to London?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As soon as possible, mother—in about six weeks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Six weeks!\" exclaimed Mrs. Staunton. \"I can\u0027t live without George for six weeks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, you can, mother—at least you\u0027ll try.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1497/44727.html","bookId":662,"book":{"id":662,"title":"A Girl in Ten Thousand","description":"简介： The speaker was a middle-aged woman.
