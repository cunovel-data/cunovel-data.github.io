{"id":44490,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX.","content":"From the first it was a bad case. The throat was not so particularly affected, but the weakness was extreme. All imaginable devices were resorted to, to keep up the patient\u0027s strength. Notwithstanding all human precautions, however, that strength failed and failed. In a few days the strong man was like an infant. He could not lift a finger, he could scarcely turn his head, his voice was completely gone. His stricken soul could only look dumbly into the world through his eyes. Those honest eyes were pathetic. Dorothy was unremitting in her attentions. She took complete charge from the very first. Dr. Edwards came and went, but he gave the nursing to Dorothy. She had prepared herself for a great fight. She had hoped to conquer, but on the third day of the doctor\u0027s illness she knew that the battle was not to the strong nor the race to the swift—in short, the good doctor was called to render up his account, his short span of mortal life was over. One evening he had lain perfectly still and in a state of apparent stupor for several hours. Dorothy stood at the foot of the bed. Her eyes were fixed on the patient. \"It is strange how much I admire him,\" she said to herself. \"I never met a nobler, truer-hearted man.\"72 \"Dorothy, come here,\" said the doctor. She went at once, and bent over him. \"I am going,\" he said, looking at her. \"Yes, Dr. Staunton,\" she answered. He closed his eyes again for a moment. \"The wife,\" he murmured—\"does she know?\" \"I am not sure,\" said Dorothy in her quiet, clear voice, which never for a moment sank to a whisper. \"I think she must guess—I have not told her.\" \"She had better know,\" said the doctor. \"Will you bring her here?\" \"Yes, I\u0027ll go and fetch her at once.\" Dorothy left the room. She stood for a moment on the landing. The task which lay immediately before her made her spirits sink. She knew just as well as Dr. Staunton did how precarious was Mrs. Staunton\u0027s tenure of life. She knew that a sudden shock might be fatal. Were those children to lose both parents? The doctor was going,—no mortal aid now could avail for him,—but must the mother also leave the children? \"I do not know what to do,\" thought Dorothy. \"She must see her husband—they must meet. He is the bravest man I know, but can he suppress his own feelings now—now that he is dying? No, no, it is too much to ask; but I greatly, greatly fear that if he does not, the shock will kill her.\" Dorothy went slowly downstairs. She was generally decisive in her actions. Now, she trembled, and a terrible nervousness seized her. When she reached the little entrance hall, and was about to open the door of the parlor where she expected to find Mrs. Staunton, she was surprised to come face to face with a tall, bronzed young man, who was taking off his hat and hanging it on one of the pegs in the hat-rack. He turned, and started73 when, he saw her. He was evidently unfamiliar with nurses and sickness. His face flushed up, and he said in a sort of apologetic way: \"Surely this is Dr. Staunton\u0027s house?\" \"Yes,\" said Dorothy. \"I am George Staunton. I—I came down on pressing business—I want to see my father in a hurry. What is the matter?\" He stepped back a pace or two, startled by the expression on Dorothy\u0027s face. \"Come in here at once,\" she said, seizing his hand. She dragged him into the seldom-used drawing-room. The moment they got inside, she deliberately locked the door. \"You have come just in time,\" she said. \"You must bear up. I hope you\u0027ll be brave. Can you bear a great shock without—without fainting, or anything of that sort?\" \"Oh, I won\u0027t faint!\" he answered. His lips trembled, his blue eyes grew wide open, the pupils began to dilate. \"I believe you are a brave lad,\" said Dorothy, noticing these signs. \"It is your lot now to come face to face with great trouble. Dr. Staunton—your father—is dying.\" \"Good God! Merciful God!\" said the lad. He sank down on the nearest chair—he was white to the lips. Dorothy went up and took his hand. \"There, there!\" she said. \"You\u0027ll be better in a moment. Try to forget yourself—we have not, any of us, a single instant just now to think of ourselves. I have come down to fetch your mother.\" \"You are the nurse?\" said George, glancing at her dress. \"Yes, I am nursing your father. It has been a74 very bad case—diphtheria—a very acute and hopeless case from the first. There\u0027s a great deal of infection. Are you afraid?\" \"No, no! don\u0027t talk of fear. I\u0027ll go to him. I—I was in trouble myself, but that must wait. I\u0027ll go to him at once.\" \"I want you to go to your mother.\" \"My mother! is she ill too?\" \"She is not exactly ill—I mean she is not worse than usual, but her life is bound up in your father\u0027s. It would be a dreadful thing for your sisters and yourself if your mother were to die. Your coming here at this moment may mean her salvation. I have to go to her now, to tell her that her dying husband has sent for her. Will you follow me into the room? Will you act according to your own impulses? I am sure God will direct you. Stay where you are for a minute—try to be brave. Follow me into the room as soon as you can.\" Dorothy left the drawing room. As she went away, she heard the young man groan. She did not give herself time to think—she opened the parlor door. Mrs. Staunton was sitting in her favorite seat by the window. Her face was scarcely at all paler than it had been a week ago. She sat then by the window, looking out at her trouble, which showed like a speck in the blue sky. The shadow which enveloped her whole life was coming closer now, enveloping her like a thick fog. Still she was bearing up. Her eyes were gazing out on the garden—on the flowers which she and the doctor had tended and loved together. Some of the younger children had clustered round her knee—one of them held her hand—another played with a bunch of keys and trinkets which she always wore at her side.75 \"Go on, mother,\" said little Marjory, aged seven. \"Don\u0027t stop.\" \"I have nearly finished,\" said Mrs. Staunton. \"But not quite. Go on, mother; I want to hear the end of the story,\" said Phil. Mrs. Staunton did not see Dorothy, who stood motionless near the door. \"They got so tired,\" she began in a monotonous sort of voice—\"so dreadfully tired, that there was nothing for them to do but to try and get into the White Garden.\" \"A White Garden!\" repeated Phil. \"Was it pretty?\" \"Lovely!\" \"Why was it called a White Garden?\" asked Marjory. \"Because of the flowers. They were all white—white roses, white lilies, snowdrops, chrysanthemums—all the flowers that are pure white without any color. The air is sweet with their perfume—the people who come to live in the White Garden wear white flowers on their white dresses—it is a beautiful sight.\" \"It must be,\" said Marjory, who had a great deal of imagination. \"Are the people happy?\" \"Perfectly happy—rested, you know, Marjory. They are peaceful as you are when you are tucked up in your little bed.\" \"I like best to play and romp,\" said Marjory in a meditative voice; \"but then, you see, I am never tired.\" \"Dorothy is standing at the door,\" exclaimed Phil. \"Come in, Dorothy, and listen to mother\u0027s beautiful story.\" \"Do you want me?\" asked Mrs. Staunton, standing76 up. She began to tremble—the children looked at her anxiously. Dorothy went straight up and took her hand. \"Dr. Staunton wishes to see you,\" she said. \"Will you come with me?\" She looked anxiously toward the door. Mrs. Staunton put up her hand to her head. \"Good-bye, my darlings,\" she said, looking at the little pair, who were gazing up at her with puzzled faces. \"Go and play in the garden, and don\u0027t forget the White Garden about which we have been speaking.\" She stooped down and deliberately kissed both children, then she held out her hand to Dorothy. \"I am quite ready,\" she said. At that moment George entered the room. He put his arms round his mother. He was a big fellow—his arms were strong. The muscles in his neck seemed to start out, his eyes looked straight into his mother\u0027s. \"You have got me, mother; I am George,\" he said. \"Come, let us go to my father together.\" Mrs. Staunton tottered upstairs. She was not in the least surprised at seeing George, but she leaned very firmly on him. They went into the sickroom, and when George knelt down by his father\u0027s bedside, Mrs. Staunton knelt by him. The doctor was going deeper and deeper into the valley from which there is no return. Earthly sounds were growing dim to his ears—earthly voices were losing their meaning—earthly sights were fading before his failing eyes. The dew of death was on his forehead. Mrs. Staunton, whose face was nearly as white, bent down lower and lower until her lips touched his hand. The touch of her lips made him open his eyes. He saw his wife; the look on her face seemed to bring him back to earth again—it was like a sort of return wave, landing him high on the shores of time. His impulse was to say, \"Come with me—let us enter into the rest of the Lord together;\" but then he saw George. George had thrown his arm round his mother\u0027s waist. \"Let me keep her, father,\" said the young man. \"Don\u0027t take her yet, let me keep her.\" \"Yes, stay with the lad, Mary,\" said the doctor. It was a final act of self-renunciation. His eyelids drooped over his dying eyes—he never spoke again.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1497/44725.html","bookId":662,"book":{"id":662,"title":"A Girl in Ten Thousand","description":"简介： The speaker was a middle-aged woman.
