{"id":44500,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX.","content":"Dorothy talked a little longer to Effie. When at last she left her, the poor girl felt soothed and strengthened. She dropped off to sleep, to dream of the old days when she was living in the pretty little cottage in Whittington, and when she longed so earnestly to go out into the wide world. Effie woke long before it was time to get up. She thought of142 her dream, and sighed heavily to herself. She was in the wide world now with a vengeance. Did it look as fair, as rose-colored, as fascinating, as it used to look in her early dreams? No; the reality was bitter enough. She would have given a great deal at that heavy moment of her life to turn back the page and be a child at home again. The nurses\u0027 bell rang, and she got up quickly. Next week she was to take her turn at night-nursing. She was getting on well, and, notwithstanding the small cloud which now existed between her and Sister Kate, Sister Kate knew Effie\u0027s value. There are nurses and nurses. Many girls who go as probationers to the great hospitals are thoroughly unsuited to the life; their qualifications are not those essential to the good nurse; they are destitute of tact, of presence of mind, of that tenderness which can be firm as well as gentle. But Effie was an ideal nurse; her soft and gentle ways, her kind yet firm glance, the cleverness she showed, the tact she displayed, all proved to Sister Kate that the young probationer might one day be a valuable help to her. She was angry with Effie at present, but she was determined to leave no stone unturned to help the girl and train her thoroughly in her noble profession. During that night Sister Kate had thought of Effie. She had noticed her pale face during the past day, the sadness in her eyes, the heaviness in her steps, and her heart smote her a little, a very little. \"I don\u0027t believe that girl could do anything mean or underhanded,\" she reflected. \"Of course it is tiresome that she should know any of the medical students, but I believe I can trust her word that she will never speak to this young man except out of the hospital.\" Accordingly, Sister Kate met Effie the next morning143 with much of her old pleasantness. Effie\u0027s sad heart bounded again in her breast when Sister Kate spoke kindly to her, and she went about her duties with the determination not to leave even the smallest matter undone. Thoroughly but carefully she went through all the minuti? of those everlasting cleanings and brushings. At last her morning\u0027s work was over, and now came the crucial moment when she must speak to Sister Kate. The doctors had gone their rounds, the patients were all settled for the morning. Effie came up to Sister Kate in one of the corridors. \"Can you spare me a few moments of your time?\" she asked. The Sister looked up at the tall clock in the passage. \"Do you want to see me about anything important?\" she asked. \"Yes, it is something important.\" \"Well, come into my private room; I can give you five minutes.\" Sister Kate sat down—Effie stood before her. \"I\u0027ll try and tell you what I want as briefly as possible,\" she said. \"I wish to know if I can be spared to go out this afternoon?\" \"It is not your afternoon out. What do you mean?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t ask if it wasn\u0027t necessary. The fact is, there\u0027s great trouble at home, and I—I must see my mother, and perhaps I may have to make another visit.\" Sister Kate frowned. \"I don\u0027t wish not to sympathize with you, of course,\" she said, after a pause, \"but the fact is, nurses should detach themselves as much as possible from home-life. The nurse who really gives herself144 up to her splendid calling has to try to forget that she has a home. She has to remember that her first duties consist in taking care of her patients and in learning her profession.\" \"Then I can\u0027t be a nurse,\" said Effie, the color rushing into her face. Sister Kate looked at her and shook her head. \"I am very sorry,\" she said, after a pause. \"The fact is, I had great hopes of you—you have many of the qualifications which go to make a splendid nurse; I won\u0027t recount them here. I had, as I said, great hopes of you, but your words now make me fear that, excellent as those qualifications are, they are overbalanced.\" \"By what?\" asked Effie. \"By sentimentality—by nervous overworry about matters which you should leave in other hands.\" \"I have no other hands to leave them in; the fact is, home duties must always be first with me. I\u0027ve got a mother and several young brothers and sisters. I am the eldest daughter. I cannot let my mother suffer, even to indulge what has been for a long time the great dream of my life. It is very probable that I shall have to give up being a nurse.\" \"How can you? You are engaged here for three years.\" \"I must beg of the Governors of the hospital to let me off; the case is a special one—the trouble under which I am suffering is most unexpected. I fear, I greatly fear, that I shall be obliged to leave the hospital for a time.\" \"I am truly sorry to hear that,\" said Sister Kate. \"Does your friend Miss Fraser know of this?\" \"Yes.\" \"I hope it may not be necessary. As I said, you have the making of a good nurse in you. You want145 to go away for a few hours? Well, I\u0027ll try and manage it. Perhaps when you go home and see your people, you will find that it is unnecessary for you to sacrifice yourself to this extent. Anyhow you can have from two till five to-day. Now go and much in train for the afternoon as you can. You can stay out from two till five. I hope you\u0027ll have good news for me when you return.\" \"I hope I shall,\" said Effie; but her heart felt low. She had little expectation of being able to continue the life which she longed to perfect herself in. At two o\u0027clock she went out, and did not take many minutes in reaching her mother\u0027s door. Mrs. Staunton looked surprised to see her. \"What is the matter. Effie?\" she said. \"How white and worn you look! Why have you come back to-day?\" \"I wanted to see you, mother, so I got an afternoon off duty. Sister Kate was kind—I begged of her to let me come. I have a great longing to see you.\" \"Well, my dear, I\u0027m all right. The fact is, I get better and better.\" Mrs. Staunton was seated by the window. She was making a pinafore for little Marjory—her needle flew in and out of the stuff. She was trimming the pinafore with narrow lace. Effie took it up and sat down by her mother. \"Your hands tremble, mother; are you really well?\" \"Oh, yes, my love; yes! You look at me as if you thought there was something the matter. Have you—Effie, your looks frighten me.\" \"Don\u0027t let them frighten you, dear mother. You know the greatest longing of my heart is to help146 and serve you. If there is anything worrying you, you\u0027ll tell me, won\u0027t you?\" \"I will,\" said Mrs. Staunton. She paused and looked at her daughter. \"There\u0027s nothing exactly worrying me,\" she said, after a pause, \"but still I feel a little bit anxious.\" \"You\u0027ll tell me, won\u0027t you?\" \"You won\u0027t scold me, Effie?\" \"As if I could, mother darling!\" \"Well, perhaps I did a rash thing—poor dear George!—You know how devoted I am to him, Effie?\" \"Oh, yes, mother darling, anyone can see that.\" \"Well, the fact is, I—I yielded to his entreaties. Perhaps I ought not to tell you, Effie—perhaps it will displease him.\" \"Yes, do tell me,\" said Effie. \"There ought not to be any secrets in one\u0027s family. I ought to know—I will know. You are worried about something, and I will know what your burden is. What is it, mother?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you in a few words. There\u0027s nothing in it, after all. Shortly after you left us, George persuaded me to put my money into the City Bank in his name. He said it seemed such folly to have two accounts for such very small sums.\" \"You did it?\" said Effie, her face turning white. \"Yes, yes, I knew you would reproach me. I won\u0027t be reproached—I won\u0027t!\" \"I will not say a word, dearest, dearest mother. Take my hand—your hand does shake so. Now tell me all about it.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s nothing, my love, really, only——\" \"Yes, mother—only?\" \"Only this morning I asked George to fill in a check for me before he went to town. He did so.147 It was for five pounds. He seemed vexed at my requiring so much, but I said I couldn\u0027t do with less, for there was the landlady to pay, and the butcher has been so troublesome with his bills. I couldn\u0027t do with less than five pounds, and George drew a check for me for that amount. I sent Aggie with it straight to the bank, and——\" Mrs. Staunton\u0027s face became very pale, her hand shook more violently than ever. \"Yes, mother?\" said Effie. \"They sent it back. Effie, with \u0027No effects\u0027 written across the back. I am sure there must be a mistake, but they told Aggie that George had overdrawn his account, and that they couldn\u0027t cash this check—there were no effects, that was it.\" \"No effects!\" said Effie, her face scarlet. \"But hadn\u0027t you some of your money still left in the bank?\" \"Yes, I had over fifty pounds. I put the money into the bank in George\u0027s name over a week ago. It was to last us for some time. Oh, Effie, don\u0027t look at me with those reproachful eyes! I feel faint.\" Effie got up quickly; she poured some sal-volatile into a wineglass, and, filling it up with water, brought it to her mother to drink. Mrs. Staunton was soon better. The passing weakness went off quickly. \"What is to be done?\" she said, raising her eyes to her daughter. \"Oh, I am so glad you don\u0027t scold me, Effie.\" \"Of course I don\u0027t, mother darling. You must have money, you can\u0027t get on without it.\" \"That\u0027s just what I say. I am sure I am as saving as woman could be, but the expenses are so heavy.\" \"Yes, of course.\"148 \"I\u0027m expecting George in every minute,\" said Mrs. Staunton. \"He has very likely put the money back into the bank now. He is doing such a splendid business that perhaps he drew the fifty pounds—meaning to return it at once. He has such a capital head for making money—really, I never knew such a boy. I dare say he has put it back doubled.\" \"Oh, mother, don\u0027t you know better?—how can he do that? But now let us talk of something else. Here\u0027s Agnes, that\u0027s right. Agnes, will you get some tea for mother? She\u0027s quite weak and upset. I\u0027m going out. I must hurry, for I\u0027ve to be back at the hospital at five. I\u0027m going out, but I\u0027ll come to see you mother, before I return to the hospital. Get the tea, Agnes; don\u0027t be long about it.\" Agnes put a little kettle on the fire. \"Do you know about—about the check?\" she asked Effie in a whisper. \"Oh, yes; don\u0027t make a fuss over it—it will be all right.\" \"Mrs. Robinson says she must be paid—she is owed four weeks\u0027 rent, and she won\u0027t let it go on any longer.\" \"I\u0027ll see her when I come back,\" said Effie. \"Now, do take care of mother. I won\u0027t be away a minute longer than I can help.\" \"Won\u0027t you have a cup of tea first, Effie?\" \"No, no; I\u0027ve no time.\" Effie ran downstairs, and went out into the street. She felt nerved and braced now. The moment of indecision was past—the moment for definite action had arrived. There was no question with regard to her duty. It lay plain and straight before her. She happened to know that the Harveys were in town. They were staying in Eaton Place. She took an omnibus, which presently brought her into the149 neighborhood of Victoria; a few minutes afterward she rang the bell at their hall door. A man-servant, whom she did not know, opened it. \"Is Mrs. Harvey at home?\" asked Effie. \"I believe so,\" he replied, \"but I\u0027m not sure if she can see anyone.\" \"Perhaps she will see me if you give her my name,\" said Effie in a gentle voice. \"Say Miss Effie Staunton, please, and that I am anxious to see her on pressing business.\" The man withdrew, inviting Effie as he did so into the hall. \"He takes me for a servant,\" she said to herself. \"Well, what matter? That truly is only a pinprick.\" In a minute or two he returned, with a changed expression on his face. \"Follow me upstairs, please, miss,\" he said. \"My mistress will see you.\" Effie followed him up some low stairs—her feet sank into the rich carpets. The contrast between this luxurious house and the severity of the hospital sickened her. \"I shall choke if I live here,\" she said to herself. But then she crushed all thought of self. The men led her up two or three short flights of stairs. At last he knocked at a door, before which a rich curtain hung. A voice said \"Come in,\" and Effie found herself in Mrs. Harvey\u0027s presence. She was seated in a deep armchair; her maid stood before her, holding out different rich brocades and silks which had just been sent round for her to see. \"That will do, Carey,\" she said, when she saw Effie. \"You can take all those things away. Tell Madam Miller that I have decided on this blue silk150 crépon, and this rose-colored silk. I\u0027ll call round to be fitted to-morrow morning. Now, Miss Staunton, I\u0027m sorry to have kept you waiting. How do you do? I am so glad to see you.\" Mrs. Harvey was not so impulsively glad as she had been the last time she saw Effie. The doctor\u0027s death—the death he had died for her—seemed removed into the background; her existence was absorbed in pleasure, in gayety and excitement. She had an affectionate, kindly nature, however, and one glance into Effie\u0027s sad eyes softened her toward the poor girl. \"Well, what can I do for you?\" she said. \"How are you? Why, you are a nurse—you are in nurse\u0027s dress—how capital! What a splendid idea!\" \"Yes, I am a probationer at St. Joseph\u0027s,\" said Effie. \"Oh my dear child, that\u0027s splendid for you, of course; but I trust you have brought no infection in your clothes.\" \"No,\" said Effie, with the faintest of smiles. \"I have nothing to do with any of the infectious wards. I am quite safe. I want to speak to you.\" \"I shall be very glad to listen to you, my dear. You know, of course, that the Squire and I take the deepest interest in you and in your family. By the way, how is your dear mother, and how are all those pretty girls and boys getting on?\" Effie could not remember that Mrs. Harvey had ever seen her mother—why, therefore, should she speak of her as \"dear\"? and as to the boys and girls, they were not specially remarkable for their good looks, and if they were, Mrs. Harvey knew nothing about it. She answered these conventional inquiries in a quiet voice. \"I hope you\u0027ll forgive me,\" she said, at the first151 possible pause, \"but I am in a very great hurry. I have promised to be back again at St. Joseph\u0027s at five o\u0027clock, and it\u0027s nearly four now. May I tell you what I really came about?\" \"Oh, yes, of course, of course!\" \"Do you remember, before I came to London, the very kind offer you and the Squire made me?\" \"Of course,\" said Mrs. Harvey, \"if you mean our wish that you should become governess to little Freda. But Freda goes to a kindergarten now. Carey takes her around every morning, and Rhoda goes to fetch her at dinner time. The life seems to suit her very well. Of course we did wish for you very much, but as you could not come—oh, no doubt you have chosen wisely.\" Mrs. Harvey yawned; she stretched out her hand and rang the bell. The servant appeared almost immediately. \"Tea for two,\" she said, \"and be quick, Andrews.\" \"I can\u0027t wait for tea,\" said Effie, rising. \"I am very much obliged. I only came to say that circumstances would make me inclined to accept your offer now, but as you don\u0027t want a governess there\u0027s nothing more to be said.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s so sweetly good of you, Miss Staunton, and had matters been different we should have been pleased. Well, good-by, if you must go. Where did you say your mother lived?\" \"A long way from here.\" \"But do give me her address. I should be so pleased to drive round and see her some day. Perhaps she would go for a drive with me. What a good idea! Yes, I\u0027ll come. Where did you say you lived?\" Effie had not said anything.152 Mrs. Harvey held out her limp, long hand. \"Good-by, Miss Staunton. You know I take a great interest in you,\" she exclaimed.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1497/44735.html","bookId":662,"book":{"id":662,"title":"A Girl in Ten Thousand","description":"简介： The speaker was a middle-aged woman.
