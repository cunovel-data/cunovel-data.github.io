{"id":44498,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII.","content":"Sister Kate made no objection, and Effie hurried home in a state of excitement which she could scarcely restrain. Mrs. Staunton did not expect her, and the poor girl felt her heart sink low in her breast when she saw that her unexpected arrival scarcely gave satisfaction. There was a nice white cloth on the table, and a large bunch of flowers in a pretty cut-glass jug stood in the center. An attempt at dessert again graced the board, and Effie noticed that a bottle of sherry and a bottle of port stood on the little sideboard. She felt a sense of dismay. \"Even mother is beginning to keep things from me,\" she said to herself. \"It is all George, of course! They did not expect me home to-day, so they are having a particularly good dinner. Is it possible that even mother would try to deceive me? Oh, dear, dear! how changed all our life is, now that father is no longer here!\" There had never been the faintest shadow of concealment about the honest doctor, and while with her husband Mrs. Staunton was the most straightforward woman imaginable; but, alas! her character was a weak one—she was now completely under George\u0027s influence, and George had learned to walk in those crooked paths which those who begin to do wrong are always tempted to follow. He came in presently, looking particularly handsome and manly. He had on a nice new coat; and his beautifully got-up collar showed off his fresh young face to the best possible advantage.124 Mrs. Staunton called him up at once for Effie to criticise. \"Doesn\u0027t he look well in a white silk tie?\" she said. \"I like white ties better than colored ones for him, and they are not so expensive either, for I can wash them myself.\" \"I wonder all that washing does not fag you, mother,\" said Effie. Before Mrs. Staunton could reply, Mrs. Robinson appeared with the dinner, and the family sat down to an excellent meal. Effie saw quite plainly that it would be useless for her to attempt to expostulate. Mrs. Staunton, after her first start of unconcealed dismay, was very affectionate to her daughter. She told Effie that she thought she looked a little pale, and wondered whether all that nursing was not too much for her. \"No, mother, I love the work,\" said Effie. \"But that is not the question, my love,\" said Mrs. Staunton, shaking her head. \"The question is this: is it undermining your health?\" \"Well, in any case I should have to earn my living,\" said Effie. \"I could not possibly afford to do nothing at home. As well earn it as a nurse as in any other way, and I love nursing beyond anything else in the world.\" \"You always were an obstinate dear little girl, was she not, George? But, after all, Effie——\" Here Mrs. Staunton paused and looked at her son. \"I think I might tell Effie?\" she said, giving him a bright nod. \"Oh, I don\u0027t suppose there is anything to make a fuss over,\" replied George. He colored as he spoke, and looked out of the window. He could easily hoodwink his mother, but it was difficult to meet Effie\u0027s clear eyes and not to feel sure that she was125 reading him through, and seeing him as he really was. Agnes jumped up, saying it was full time to go to Sunday school; she carried off the children with her, and George, his mother, and Effie were alone. \"Sit down in your usual chair, George,\" said his mother. He did so, bringing up the port wine as he spoke, and pouring out a glass, which he insisted on his mother drinking. He tossed off one or two glasses himself, after which his eyes grew bright and steady, and a color came into his cheeks. \"Yes, tell Effie,\" he said. \"I think you might do so, George; I am so proud of you.\" \"No, mother. I like to hear you describing me; you make me feel such an awfully fine fellow.\" George laughed as he spoke. \"Well, then, Effie,\" said his mother, \"you will in future learn to appreciate our dear George as he deserves. The fact is this: he has just got a rise in his salary of a whole hundred a year. George is now earning two hundred a year; and he has arranged, dear fellow, to give me one hundred a year, in order that I may have those little comforts which he thinks I require.\" \"Is that really true?\" said Effie, coloring. \"Oh, what splendid news!\" She looked eagerly at George as she spoke. She longed to jump up, throw her arms round his neck, and kiss him. \"Is this true?\" she repeated. \"Oh, I am so glad! We do want the money so badly.\" George stooped to flick off a speck of dust which had settled on his immaculate shirt-cuff; his eyes would not meet Effie\u0027s. \"Of course it is true,\" he said in a bravado sort of voice. \"You don\u0027t suppose I would tell mother a lie, do you?\"126 \"Oh, Effie! how could you doubt him?\" said Mrs. Staunton, almost crying. \"No, mother, I don\u0027t doubt him,\" Effie replied. She walked to the window. Her momentary pleasure was over; she knew, just as well as if George had told her, that the whole thing was a fabrication. If he had more money, he was not getting it in his situation. His look, his attitude, joined to the few words Lawson had said to her, made Effie quite certain on that point. Burning words half rose to her lips, but she checked them. She did not doubt George. She read the truth in his eyes; what fell from his lips was nothing. Mrs. Staunton kept on talking. \"We shall have real comforts at home now,\" she said. \"I am, as my boy says, a wonderful manager.\" \"The best in all the world,\" interrupted George; \"there never was such a mother.\" Mrs. Staunton\u0027s eyes quite shone with pleasure. \"What I was thinking was this, Effie,\" she continued, \"that if you really are not strong enough to go on with your work, we can now afford to keep you at home.\" \"Of course we can,\" said George. He had scarcely said these words, half turning his back on Effie as he spoke, when the room door was opened by Mrs. Robinson, and Lawson was announced. When he saw his friend, George suddenly turned pale. He recovered himself in a moment, however, and went forward to meet him, speaking in a loud and bragging voice. \"Is that you, Lawson? Welcome, old chap. We did not expect you to-day, but we are right glad to see you, of course.\" \"You will stay and have tea with us, won\u0027t you,127 Mr. Lawson?\" said Mrs. Staunton in her sweet voice. \"Yes, certainly,\" said Lawson. He had given Effie his hand when he came into the room, but he scarcely looked at her. He sat down near Mrs. Staunton, and began to talk to her in his usual bright way. She yielded after a moment to his charm. Lawson was a young fellow with a great amount of general information; he had also abundance of tact, and he knew how to suit his words to Mrs. Staunton\u0027s requirements. When George saw his friend talking to his mother, he went up to Effie and stood near her. \"Come to this end of the room,\" he said abruptly. Effie followed him. \"I am likely to make quite a pile of money,\" he said, speaking in a low voice and glancing toward his mother. \"I know you think badly of me,—it\u0027s awfully hard on a fellow when his sister thinks badly of him,—but, nevertheless, I am likely to be in a real good way of business soon. And what I want to say now is this, Effie. I am anxious to pay back that ￡250 which you borrowed for me.\" \"I wish you would,\" said Effie. \"Well, I dare say I can give you fifty pounds toward it this week. Squire Harvey won\u0027t require the whole of the money back at once.\" \"Oh, he doesn\u0027t require it at all,\" said Effie. \"It is I who require it. It is my honor and the honor of my dead father that demands it. It ought to be paid back, and you ought to do it.\" \"Don\u0027t speak so loudly—you do get so excited about things,\" said George. Effie lowered her voice. Lawson, as he talked to Mrs. Staunton, glanced sharply at her. Tea was brought in, and Effie had to take her place128 at the tea-tray. George\u0027s words had made her feel more uncomfortable than ever. It was absolute nonsense to suppose that he could be earning money at this rate. After tea, Effie had to go back to the hospital. \"Good-by mother,\" she said. \"I won\u0027t see you now for a fortnight.\" Mrs. Staunton got up and put her feeble old arms round her daughter\u0027s neck. \"Good-by, my darling,\" she said. \"Take care of yourself; don\u0027t overwork yourself. Remember it is unnecessary. You have got a home, and a dear, noble, faithful brother to provide for you.\" \"Yes, Effie, you are heartily welcome to all that I can give you,\" said George in a lofty tone. Effie pressed her lips to her mother\u0027s, kept her arms for one moment round her neck, and then turned away with tears in her eyes. \"Good-by, George,\" she said, holding out her hand. \"I\u0027ll see you back to the hospital,\" said George. \"Don\u0027t do that. It is a beautiful evening; mother would like you to take a walk with her.\" \"And I\u0027d have the greatest pleasure in seeing Miss Effie home, if she would let me,\" said Lawson. George hesitated for a moment. For some reason, which was more than evident, he did not want Effie to be alone with his friend. He looked at his mother. She did not catch his eye, or she would have read his wish by instinct. The evening was really very fine, and she liked to walk round the square leaning on George\u0027s arm. When well enough, too, she liked him to take her to church. \"I think I\u0027d enjoy a little walk with you, George,\" she said. \"The evening is quite like spring—Wonderful weather for so near Christmas; the air is as129 mild and soft as milk; and as Mr. Lawson has so kindly promised to see Effie back, perhaps you\u0027d come?\" \"All right,\" said George. \"By-by, Effie; you\u0027ll hear from me, perhaps, in the course of the week.\" Effie went downstairs, followed by Lawson. As soon as ever they got out, he looked her full in the face. \"You must be greatly amazed,\" he said, \"at my presuming to bother you about your family affairs.\" \"Oh, no!\" she replied. \"I think you are kind, but your words have made me very anxious.\" \"Then,\" said Lawson, \"you see for yourself that things are not all right.\" \"I have known that for some time.\" \"George is a great friend of mine,\" continued Lawson. \"We saw a good deal of each other when he first came to town—he was a right jolly sort of fellow then; it was only about six months ago that, all of a sudden, he seemed to change. I suppose he took up with some bad companions, but I really can\u0027t say for certain.\" \"But what about him now?\" said Effie, in a voice almost irritable with anxiety. \"Have you anything fresh to tell me?\" \"You heard him, probably, say to your mother that he had a rise of salary?\" \"Yes.\" \"The fact is,\" continued Lawson, \"I know that not to be true.\" Effie also in her heart of hearts knew it not to be true, but she could not bear to hear a stranger abuse her brother. \"How can you be sure?\" she said, somewhat inconsistently. \"How can I be sure?\" he retorted. \"This is not130 a matter of sentiment, I happen to know. George is working with a relative, it is true, but Mr. Gering is one of the hardest men in the City. Everyone who understands him knows the system on which he works, and a relative has no more chance with him than another. George will have to take his rise step by step at something like the rate of ten pounds a year. Perhaps he has told your mother that he has had quite a large rise.\" \"He said a hundred a year; he said he was now receiving two hundred a year.\" \"What is to be done?\" said Lawson, \"Something ought to be done to stop it. Your mother will certainly live beyond her means, and then you will all get into no end of a mess. Do forgive me for taking an interest; the fact is, George was a great friend of mine once.\" \"Oh, please don\u0027t give him up!\" said Effie. \"If good men turn against him, what chance has he, poor fellow?\" \"I won\u0027t, if you wish me to look after him,\" said Lawson, giving her a quick glance. At this moment two nurses from St. Joseph\u0027s Hospital, who were crossing the street, saw Effie. They noticed her earnest face, the sparkle in her eyes; they also observed the glance which the handsome young medical student gave her. The women nudged one another, smiled, and went on. Effie never saw them. \"Let us walk a little faster,\" said Lawson, who was not so unobservant. He felt vexed that the women should see him with Effie, but now that he was with her he must at least unburden his mind. \"George told me,\" said Effie,—\"perhaps it is not wrong to repeat it to you,—that he is likely to make a great deal of money.\"131 \"Did he? Did he tell you that—did he happen to say how much?\" \"Well, he spoke as if money were very easily earned,\" said Effie. \"He said something about getting fifty pounds this week.\" \"I must tell you the truth,\" said Lawson. \"There\u0027s no help for it. Your brother will go straight to the bad if he is not rescued, and that at once.\" \"What do you mean? Oh, how you frighten me!\" Effie\u0027s face was as white as a sheet. \"I am ever so sorry,\" said Lawson; \"but what is the use of keeping back the truth? George has had no rise of salary—indeed, if he is not careful, he is mother has gone far beyond our means. She hasn\u0027t [Transcriber\u0027s note: text of this paragraph in original is as shown and ends abruptly at this point.] \"Then how does he get his money?\" \"He gets it by gambling.\" \"Gambling! Oh, no! oh, no!\" said Effie. She had the horror of that vice which a pure-minded, well-brought-up girl must ever have. \"It is true,\" said Lawson; \"it gives me the greatest pain to tell you anything so bad of your brother, but there\u0027s no help for it.\" \"But how do you know?\" interrupted Effie. \"I know by the best of evidence. I have had my suspicions for some time, but I happened to see him coming out of one of those places last week—yes, I must tell you, I saw him coming out of a gambling den. I think he goes night after night. At present he is winning more than he loses, but that is always the game for drawing fellows on.\" \"It must be stopped,\" said Effie. She felt quite faint and sick. If her mother knew this it would kill her on the spot. They had nearly reached the hospital, and Effie turned and faced Lawson.132 \"You don\u0027t half know what this means to me,\" she said. \"George is not exactly like an ordinary brother. When my father died quite suddenly of diphtheria some months ago, he left my mother in George\u0027s care. If George goes to the bad now, she will certainly die; you must have noticed for yourself how she is wrapped up in him.\" \"Yes; no one could fail to notice it. I think her love for him beautiful; and he loves her, too. Poor fellow! that is his great redeeming point.\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t call it real love,\" said Effie, almost with passion—\"to deceive her as he does—to do wrong, and that sort of wrong. Oh, I think my heart will break!\" Tears choked her voice, she had the greatest possible difficulty in keeping them back. Lawson took out his watch. \"You are not late,\" he said. \"Let us take a turn round this square.\" They had entered an old-fashioned square where there were very few people. They walked round and round the dismal central garden for some time. Lawson talked, and Effie listened. After a time they decided that George\u0027s perilous downward career must be stopped at any cost. Lawson said he would make it his business to see George the following evening, to tell him quite frankly what he knew, and, in short, to compel him, if necessary, to do what was right. \"He\u0027ll be obstinate,\" said Effie—\"I know he\u0027ll be hard to deal with. Oh, what shall we do?—what shall we do? I am quite certain that already my mother has gone far beyond our means. She hasn\u0027t been half careful enough since I left her. If George stops getting money in this way she\u0027ll wonder and133 question. I doubt very much whether you can have the least influence over him. What is to be done?\" \"Don\u0027t be so down-hearted,\" said Lawson. \"He requires a man to tackle him—a man who really knows the temptations young fellows meet. If you\u0027ll allow me to say so, Miss Staunton, I don\u0027t think the case quite hopeless; anyhow, you may be quite sure I\u0027ll do my best for him.\" \"Thank you,\" said poor Effie; \"you are more than good, and I do trust you.\" She hurried back to the hospital; but, to her dismay, when she got there, found that she was a quarter of an hour late. Absolute punctuality in returning from any outdoor pleasure is expected from all nurses. She hurried upstairs, hoping that she might gain her room, put on her cap and apron, and return to the ward before Sister Kate had time to miss her. This might have been the case—for Sister Kate had been very much occupied with some anxious cases during the afternoon—had not one of the nurses, who had a spite against Effie for being prettier and cleverer than herself, drawn Sister Kate\u0027s attention, to the fact that the young probationer was behind her time. This nurse had seen Effie walking with Lawson. Immediately her spirit of jealousy and envy was up in arms; she did not for a moment consider what injury she might do the poor girl by her false and unkind words. \"Nurse Staunton is late,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know how I am possibly to get the ward in order for the night unless I have some help.\" \"I must speak to her,\" said Sister Kate, glancing at the clock, and looking a little annoyed. \"This wasn\u0027t her Sunday to go out, either. I cannot let the rules be broken in this way. Let me know as soon as ever she comes in.\"134 \"I suppose there\u0027s some excuse to be made for her,\" said the nurse, speaking in a knowing way. \"She\u0027s a very careful, good sort of girl, but there are times when the best of us forget ourselves.\" The woman knew that Sister Kate would interpret her words as she wished her to do. She went off in a hurry to perform her duties, and when Effie entered the ward, Sister Kate received her with marked coldness. \"You are very late, nurse,\" she said. \"Where have you been?\" \"I have been at home with my mother.\" \"Was your mother ill? Is that your excuse for being behind your time?\" \"No; mother was well—better than she has been for some time.\" \"Then why are you late?\" \"The fact is, I was walking with a friend, and forgot to notice the hour.\" \"That\u0027s no excuse. You have certainly behaved very carelessly, and have put the other nurses out by not being in time to take your duties. Who was the friend with whom you were walking?\" Sister Kate had no right to ask this question, but she felt much provoked at the moment, and the color which rushed all over Effie\u0027s face excited her curiosity. \"Perhaps you\u0027ll think I did wrong,\" said Effie, looking up at her almost defiantly. \"The friend was Mr. Lawson. He knows my brother very well; he was talking to me about him. I cannot refuse to speak to him when I see him out of doors, can I?\" \"Don\u0027t be pert, nurse! You know it is one of the strictest rules of the hospital that none of the nurses are to speak to the medical students.\"135 \"I know; and I don\u0027t wish to speak to him in the hospital.\" \"See you don\u0027t, or you\u0027ll be dismissed at once; in fact, the less you know of any of the medical students, the better for you. I am very sorry that this young man knows your brother. I should not have had anything to do with you, had I been aware of this fact.\" \"How absurd and unjust!\" murmured Effie under her breath. She turned away—she felt absolutely cross. Sister Kate called her back. \"Now, bustle about,\" she said. \"The supper-trays want to be taken away; the women are perfectly tired of waiting to be settled for the night.\" Effie moved mechanically about her duties. Her heart felt sick. She did not think she could remain much longer under Sister Kate\u0027s care. \"If she treats me like this,\" thought the proud girl, \"I cannot endure it. Mr. Lawson is nothing to me—he is only my brother\u0027s friend. He is good, and wants to help us in an hour of great perplexity. What shall I do? I feel tied and fettered in every way.\" She laid her head on her pillow only to burst into tears. She cried herself to sleep. All the world seemed black to her.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1497/44733.html","bookId":662,"book":{"id":662,"title":"A Girl in Ten Thousand","description":"简介： The speaker was a middle-aged woman.
