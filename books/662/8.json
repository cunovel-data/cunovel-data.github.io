{"id":44489,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII.","content":"It did not take Effie long to harness the old horse to the gig. She had often driven old Jock, and this part of her task did not put her out in the least. She had a curious sense, as she was driving toward The Grange in the fresh early morning air, of the complete change which was awaiting her. She was quite certain that one door in her life was shut—shut forever. She had longed for change,—it had come at last with a vengeance; it was horrible,—it made her shudder. \\n\\n \\n\\n Effie was a thoroughly healthy girl, healthy both in mind and body, but now a sick pain was over her. She did not care to think of the real terror which haunted her. She arrived at The Grange between six and seven o\u0027clock. The woman at the lodge ran out and opened the gate for the doctor\u0027s gig in some68 surprise. She thought something was wrong again up at the house, but her surprise strengthened to astonishment when she saw that Effie was driving the horse. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Miss Effie, what is the matter?\" she exclaimed. Everyone in the place knew Effie, and loved her for her father\u0027s sake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The doctor is ill, Mrs. Jones,\" said Effie, \"and I have come to fetch Miss Fraser.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, God help us! he hasn\u0027t taken it?\" said the woman, falling back a step or two in horror. \\n\\n \\n\\n Effie nodded her head—she had no words to speak. She whipped up Jock, and drove quickly down the avenue. \\n\\n \\n\\n A kitchen-maid was on her knees whitening and polishing the front steps. Effie jumped from the gig, and asked the girl to call someone to hold the horse. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There ain\u0027t any of the men round just now, it is too early,\" said the girl. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then take the reins yourself,\" said Effie. \"Stand just here; Jock won\u0027t stir if I tell him to be quiet. Hold the reins. I am in a great hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are Miss Effie Staunton, ain\u0027t you, miss?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am. My father is ill, and I want Miss Fraser.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God help us! the doctor ill!\" exclaimed the girl. \\n\\n \\n\\n She stood where Effie told her, holding Jock\u0027s reins. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be quiet, Jock; don\u0027t stir till I come out,\" said Effie. The old horse drooped his head. Effie ran up the steps and into the house. She had never been at The Grange before, but she had no eyes for the beauties of the old place this morning. There was something too awful lying at the bottom of her heart, for any external things to affect her. She went quickly up the broad front stairs, and paused on the first landing. How was she to discover the room where69 Dorothy and little Freda Harvey spent their time together? She was about to turn back in utter bewilderment, when, to her relief, she saw another servant. The servant stopped and stared at Effie. Effie came up to her quickly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You may be surprised to see me here,\" she said. \"I am Miss Staunton, Dr. Staunton\u0027s daughter. He is ill. I want to see Nurse Fraser immediately. Take me to her at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We are none of us allowed near that part of the house, miss,\" replied the woman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can take me in the direction, anyhow, and explain to me how I am to get to Miss Fraser,\" said Effie. \"Come, there\u0027s not an instant to lose—be quick.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes! I can take you in the direction,\" said the girl. \\n\\n \\n\\n She turned down a corridor; Effie followed her. The servant walked rather slowly and in a dubious sort of way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you hurry?\" said Effie. \"It is a matter of life and death.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The girl hastened her steps a little. Effie\u0027s manner frightened her. Presently they reached a baize door—the servant pushed it open, but stood aside herself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is as much as my place is worth to open this door,\" she said. \"It is here the infectious case is, and Miss Fraser\u0027s own orders are that the door is not to be opened; but you frighten me somehow, miss, and I suppose there\u0027s no harm in it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, of course there is no harm. Now, tell me which is Miss Fraser\u0027s room?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The nurseries are entered by the third door as you go down that passage, miss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The servant banged to the baize door, and Effie70 found herself alone. She ran down the passage, and opened the outer nursery door. It was quiet and still, in perfect order, the blinds down, and the windows open. Effie, in spite of all her agitation, walked on tiptoe across this room. A door which led into another room was half open, and she heard someone moving about. That step, so quiet and self-possessed, must belong to Dorothy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dorothy! Dorothy! come here,\" called Effie. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dorothy Fraser, in her dressing-gown, came out to the other room at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Effie!\" she exclaimed. \"Effie Staunton!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, it is I,\" said Effie; \"it is I.\" She began to unpin her hat as she spoke. \"I have come here to stay; I am going to nurse little Freda, and you are to go back to father. The gig is waiting outside, and you can easily drive old Jock. Drive him straight home, and go as fast as ever you can.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is your father ill, Effie?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; he has taken the diphtheria. He is very ill. Mother sent me for you. If father dies, mother will die. They love each other so dearly—so very dearly. One couldn\u0027t live without the other. Go, and save them both, Dorothy, and I will stay with Freda.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are a dear, brave little girl,\" said Dorothy. \\n\\n \\n\\n She went and put her strong arms round Effie. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will go at once,\" she said. \"But are you prepared to take full charge here, Effie?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; tell me quickly what is to be done!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing to be done now but simply to see that Freda doesn\u0027t take cold. She is not free from infection yet, but she is quite out of danger, if she does not catch a chill. Treat her as you would any sick child. Rhoda is here. She is a capital girl, and will help you with Freda\u0027s food. Freda may come into this room for a little to-day, but you must see that she keeps out of a draught. Good-by. Effie. I won\u0027t be any time getting ready. I\u0027ll send you telegrams about your father. God bless you, Effie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1497/44724.html","bookId":662,"book":{"id":662,"title":"A Girl in Ten Thousand","description":"简介： The speaker was a middle-aged woman.
