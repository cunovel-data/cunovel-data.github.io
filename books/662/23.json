{"id":44504,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII.","content":"There come moments in the lives of all of us when we feel as if a restraining and powerful hand were pulling us up short. We have come to a full stop; we cannot go back, and we do not know how to proceed. These full stops in life\u0027s journey are generally awful places. We meet there, as a rule, the devil and his angels—they tear us and rend us, they shake us to our very depths with awful and overpowering temptation; if we yield, it is all over with us, we rush at headlong speed downhill. \\n\\n \\n\\n But, on the other hand, if in this pause we turn our back upon the devil, good angels come in his place—they whisper of hope and a new chance in life even for us. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Effie left George on that miserable evening, and when Lawson retired presently to his room, the young man found that he had come to such a fearful place of trial as I have just described. He was pulled179 up short, and the devil was tempting him. At one side was the devil, at the other he saw the face of his mother. It was impossible for him to lie down and sleep. He fought with the devil all night. In the morning there was neither victory nor defeat, but the young, smooth face looked haggard and gray, and the upright, well-knit figure was bowed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lawson came into the sitting room for a moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am sorry I can\u0027t stay with you, George,\" he said. \"I am due at St. Joseph\u0027s at nine o\u0027clock. Have you made any plans for yourself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No—at least, yes. I\u0027ve had an awful night, Lawson, and there seems to be but one end to it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must give myself up. I\u0027m not the sort of fellow to play the hiding game successfully. I\u0027m safe to be caught sooner or later. I deserve punishment, too—I\u0027ve been doing badly for months. What I deserve, it seems likely I\u0027ll have. In short, I think I\u0027d better make a clean breast of everything, and take my—my punishment like a man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do sit down for a minute,\" said Lawson. \"There\u0027s a good deal in what you say, and if you had only yourself to consider, I\u0027d counsel you to do it—I would, truly; but there\u0027s your mother to be thought of.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My mother! Don\u0027t you suppose I\u0027ve been thinking of my mother all night? It is the thought of my mother that maddens me—maddens me, I say. Look here, Lawson, there\u0027s only one thing before me: I\u0027ll go first to mother and tell her everything straight out, and then I\u0027ll give myself up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You will?\" said Lawson, with a start of sudden admiration. \"Upon my word, George, old chap,180 I didn\u0027t think you had the grit in you—I didn\u0027t, truly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you approve?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is the only thing to be done; she must hear it, sooner or later, and no one can tell it to her as you can.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right; I\u0027ll go to her before my courage fails me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George left the room without even saying good-by to his friend. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he left the house, he turned round and saw the man whom he had noticed watching him the day before at Waterloo Station. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be ready for you soon, my friend, but not quite yet,\" muttered the young man. \\n\\n \\n\\n He walked quickly—the man followed him at a respectful distance. \\n\\n \\n\\n George let himself into his mother\u0027s house with a latch-key. He ran up to the little sitting room. Agnes was bending with red eyes over a kettle which was boiling on the fire. She was making a cup of tea for her mother, who had just awakened. Katie was cutting bread and butter, and Phil and Marjory were standing by the window. Marjory was saying to Phil, \"I \u0027spect George will be turning the corner and coming home in a minute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hush!\" whispered Phil: \"hush, Marjory! George isn\u0027t coming back any more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this moment the door was opened, and George came in. Marjory gave Phil a scornful glance, and flew to her big brother. Katie flung down the piece of bread she was buttering and Agnes turned from the fire. George put out his hand to ward them all off. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where\u0027s mother?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s awake, but she has been very ill,\" began181 Agnes. \"Oh, George, George, do be careful; where are you going?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To my mother,\" answered the young man. \"Don\u0027t let anyone come with me—I want to be alone with her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He went straight into the bedroom as he spoke, and shut the door behind him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Staunton was lying propped up high by pillows. The powerful opiate had soothed her, but the image of George still filled all her horizon. When she saw him come into the room, she smiled, and stretched out her weak arms to clasp him. He came over, knelt by her, and, taking her hot hands, covered his face with them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve come back, my boy!\" she said. \"I\u0027m not very well to-day, but I\u0027ll soon be better. Why, what is it, George? What are you doing? You are wetting my hands. You—you are crying? What is it, George?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have come back to tell you something, mother. I\u0027m not what you think me—I\u0027m a scoundrel, a rascal. I\u0027m bad, I\u0027m not good. I—I\u0027ve been deceiving you—I\u0027m a thief.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hush!\" interrupted Mrs. Staunton. \"Come a little closer to me. You\u0027re not well, my dear boy—let me put my arm round your neck. You\u0027re not well, my own lad; but if you think——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m as bad as I can be, mother,\" said George, \"but it isn\u0027t bodily illness that ails me. I said I\u0027d make a clean breast of it. It\u0027s the only thing left for me to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A frightened look came into Mrs. Staunton\u0027s eyes for a moment, but then they filled with satisfaction as they rested on the dark head close to her own. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whatever you\u0027ve done, you are my boy,\" she said.182 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no; a thief isn\u0027t your boy,\" said George. \"I tell you I\u0027m a thief,\" he added fiercely, looking up at her with two bloodshot eyes. \"You\u0027ve got to believe it. I\u0027m a thief. I stole fifty pounds from Gering yesterday—and I was bad before that. I won money at play—I\u0027ve won and lost, and I\u0027ve lost and won. Once Lawson gave me two hundred and fifty pounds to invest, and I stole it to pay a gambling debt, and Effie got it back for me—she borrowed it for me. My father wouldn\u0027t have given you to me if he had known that. I had it on my conscience when I was kneeling by his deathbed, but I couldn\u0027t tell him then; and when he gave you to me, I felt that I never could tell. Then we came to London, and I began to deceive you. I told you a false story about that rise of salary—I never had any rise; and I took your fifty pounds two days ago out of the bank, and I stole money to pay it back again. That\u0027s your son George, mother—your true son in his real colors. Now you know everything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George stepped a pace or two away from the bed as he spoke. He folded his arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Staunton was looking at him with a piteous, frightened expression on her face. Suddenly she broke into a feeble and yet terrible laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My son George,\" she said. \"That explains everything. My son still—still my son!\" She laughed again. \\n\\n \\n\\n There came a knock at the outer door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t go, George!\" said his mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"George, you\u0027re wanted,\" said Agnes. \"Effie is here, and Mr. Gering—they want to see you. Come at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Gering!\" exclaimed the mother. \"He was the man you took the money from. He\u0027s coming to—punish183 you, to—George, you\u0027re not to go. Stay here with me. I\u0027ll hide you. You\u0027re not to go, George—I won\u0027t let you, I won\u0027t let you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear mother! dear, dearest mother! you must let me—I must take the punishment. I\u0027ve deserved it and I\u0027m determined to go through with it. Just say a wonderful thing to me before I go, and I\u0027ll be strong enough to bear it—and to—to come back to you when it\u0027s over. Say you love me still, mother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Love you!\" exclaimed Mrs. Staunton. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, mother, although I\u0027m a thief.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bless the boy! that has nothing to do with it. You\u0027re my boy, whatever you are.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you do still love me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, yes, yes! Of course I love the lad!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George went straight to the door and opened it. He walked straight into the other room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m ready to take the punishment, sir,\" he said, going straight up to Mr. Gering. \\n\\n \\n\\n His manner and the look on his face amazed his late employer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eh—eh—well, young sir,\" he said, backing a step or two. \"And so you confess that you robbed me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you know what lies before you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you been deceiving that mother of yours again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; I\u0027ve been telling her the truth at last.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Effie, Effie!\" called Mrs. Staunton from the bedroom. \\n\\n \\n\\n Effie ran to her mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know, young man,\" said Mr. Gering, \"that you have got a very remarkable sister?\"184 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you mean Effie? Oh, I always knew she was a girl in a thousand.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A girl in ten thousand, more like. Do you know, young rascal, that she has been pleading with me for you, and—\u0027pon my word, it\u0027s true—melting my old heart till I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing? In short, I\u0027ve made her a promise.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A promise! Oh, sir, what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A promise that I\u0027ll let you off—all but the moral punishment. That, of course, you\u0027ll have to bear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Gering, is this true?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, it\u0027s true. I\u0027m doing it all on account of your sister. You may come back to the office to-morrow, and consider that you\u0027ve got a fresh start. Now, for goodness\u0027 sake, don\u0027t keep me any longer. Open the door, one of you children, can\u0027t you? I must hurry back to my work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That is the story, for George really did learn his lesson, and in his case the new leaf was turned. He will carry the scars, however, of that time of sin and suffering to his grave. \\n\\n \\n\\n Effie kept her promise, and went as governess to little Freda Harvey for a time, but only for a time. When money affairs were straight again, she gladly returned to the life which she really loved, and is now superintendent of one of the wards at St. Joseph\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n It is true that there are whispers afloat with regard to her and Lawson—whispers which always give a feeling of consternation in the ward which she manages so skillfully—but only Effie herself can tell if there is truth in them or not. \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1497/44739.html","bookId":662,"book":{"id":662,"title":"A Girl in Ten Thousand","description":"简介： The speaker was a middle-aged woman.
