{"id":44495,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV.","content":"In a week\u0027s time Effie found herself an inmate in the great hospital which, for present purposes, we will call by the name of St. Joseph\u0027s. It was situated in the east of London. Dorothy had been105 trained here, and was now superintendent of one of the wards. \\n\\n \\n\\n Effie was to go up for a month\u0027s trial. At the end of that time she would be paid at the rate of twelve pounds the first year, and twenty pounds the second. Her training would take two years. A certain amount of her uniform would be also provided, and everything found for her with the exception of washing. \\n\\n \\n\\n She did not soon forget the evening of her arrival. She had said good-by to her mother, had kissed the children, had given Agnes all final directions, and at last found herself in the cab which was to take her to St. Joseph\u0027s. It drew up presently outside one of the large entrance doors. \\n\\n \\n\\n A lady, who was called the Home Sister, received Effie very kindly, and offered her a friendly cup of tea. The hour of her arrival was about four in the afternoon. She was then taken up to her own room, and instructed how to put her cap on, and how to wear her new uniform in the neatest and most compact way. Her dress was a pretty lilac check, and she wore a cap with a frill round it, and long tails at the back. Her apron bib was high to the collar in front, and fastened with straps which crossed at the back. Nothing could be neater and more serviceable than the dress. \\n\\n \\n\\n The kind Sister, having seen that Effie was all right, gave her a friendly smile, and then led her along several dim passages, up and down many stairs, until she finally found herself in a long, light ward, where from thirty to forty women were lying in bed. The Home Sister introduced Effie to the Sister of the ward, who went by the name of Sister Kate. Sister Kate nodded to her, said a word or two in a very busy voice, and then Effie found herself practically106 on the threshold of her new life. The Sister who had been kind to her during tea, who had shown her to her room, and instructed her how to dress, had vanished. Sister Kate looked far too busy and anxious to be worried by questions; and Effie, capable and active as she always was, found herself, for the first time in her life, with nothing to do, and overcome by strange nervousness. She was too much embarrassed to be of real use. Her face was burning with blushes. Sister Kate was tired with her long day\u0027s work. There was a great deal to be done to put the ward straight for the night, and she really had no time to devote to the probationer. The women lying in their beds seemed to have eyes and ears for no one but Effie. Between sixty and seventy eyes turned on her wherever she moved, whatever she looked at, whatever she did. Some of the eyes in the pale and harassed faces looked kindly and interested, some of them merely amused, some of them cross and discontented. Effie knew that these women would be querulous and even rude under the touch of strange and untutored hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last the night nurses arrived, the bell rang, and Sister Kate came forward to show the new probationer the way to the dining hall. \\n\\n \\n\\n Here were several long tables, where the nurses, all dressed exactly alike, sat down to supper. Effie took her place, and quickly discovered that the others were far too tired and hungry to pay any attention to her. She felt too excited to eat, and sat watching the faces of those around her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Supper was immediately followed by prayers, and then came bed. Effie\u0027s first evening as a probationer was over. \\n\\n \\n\\n She did not know whether to cry or to laugh as she laid her head on her pillow. The reality was so107 different from anything her fancy had painted. The practical character of the work, the absence of all sentiment, the real illness, the real burden of humanity, seemed to press down upon her. \\n\\n \\n\\n She had thought, a week ago, when Dorothy proposed that she should come to St. Joseph\u0027s, of the delight of being in the same hospital with her friend, but she now discovered that she was unlikely to see much of Dorothy even though she lived under the same roof. Dorothy was Sister of a ward, and that ward was not the one where Effie was to serve her probationership. She had the comfort of a very small room to herself, and was just closing her eyes in sleep, when the handle of the room door was softly turned, and Dorothy, looking beautiful in her Sister\u0027s dress of soft navy serge, came in. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So here you are, you poor little thing,\" said Dorothy, bending over Effie and kissing her. \"I have just come in for one minute to say God bless you. You have come, the ice is broken. You have a fine career before you. Don\u0027t be discouraged by what you saw to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I am so lonely!\" said Effie, with a quiver in her voice. \"I was sure when I came here that I should be in the ward with you, Dorothy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, my dear, that was not possible,\" replied Dorothy. \"Of course I should have been very glad if it could have been arranged, but I had no voice in the matter. As it cannot be, dearest, try to believe that this is just the best thing that could have happened to you, to be flung at once, as it were, on your own feet. You will thus gain experience without having a crutch like me to lean upon. I know the first night is very bad, but you will soon learn your duties and become intensely interested108 in the life. You are with Sister Kate, are you not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Effie. \"She scarcely spoke to me—I never felt so awkward in my life, and I know that I was never half so clumsy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Dorothy, with a smile. \"Don\u0027t I know the feeling well? It all passes over, my love, and far more quickly than you have the least idea of. Remember you have got the power—those little hands are capable, that head holds a steady and sensible brain. Why, Effie, you have gone through far worse times than this without flinching. Surely, surely you are not going to break down now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I won\u0027t, I won\u0027t!\" said Effie, with a sob; \"but I felt lonely, very lonely, and it was so very kind of you to come to see me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I have come to see you—I am only too delighted to do anything in my power for you. I would have rushed down to share your cup of tea on your arrival, but a bad case was just being brought into the ward, and I could not leave. Now, I must go to bed myself, or I shan\u0027t be fit for work to-morrow. Good-night, Effie. I have arranged that you are to spend every second Sunday at home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, how good you are—how thankful I am!\" exclaimed Effie. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dorothy was leaving the room, when she turned back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I forgot to tell you that you are very lucky to be under Sister Kate,\" she said. \"There is not a nurse in the whole hospital who trains as she does, and her probationers always get the best certificates at the end of the two years of training.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She looks so severe and hard,\" said Effie. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is a little severe, and some people may call her hard, but she has a tender heart under all that109 strict, somewhat cold manner, and then she is so just. My dear, when you know more of hospital life you will be thankful that you are with a just and patient Sister. Sister Kate is both. She will soon recognize you, Effie, for what you are. Now good-night, my love.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dorothy went away, and soon afterward Effie fell asleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next morning she was awakened by a bell, at what seemed to her something like the middle of the night. She had to dress herself quickly, and then go into the ward and begin her duties. \\n\\n \\n\\n She found, somewhat to her surprise, that she had to begin her nurse\u0027s life as a sort of maid-of-all-work; she had to scrub floors, to clean grates, to polish handles—it seemed to her that she never had a moment to herself from morning till night. Her feet felt very sore, her back ached. Once or twice she felt so dreadfully fagged that she wondered if she could keep up. But through it all, growing greater and greater as the days went on, there came a sense of full satisfaction, of something accomplished, something done, of the feeling that she was being trained thoroughly and efficiently, so that at the end of her time of probation she might be able to say, \"There\u0027s one thing which I can do well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When the first Sunday came she was glad to hurry home. She went back brimful of news, and looked forward to the quiet time in her mother\u0027s little parlor with great delight. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Staunton was glad to see her. The children were all dressed in their black frocks, and looked neat and comfortable. George was in the room. It seemed to Effie as if she did not recognize his coat—she wondered if it could possibly be a new one.110 \\n\\n \\n\\n She arrived at home a little before the midday dinner, and presently the landlady came in to lay the cloth. This used to be Agnes\u0027 occupation. Effie did not say anything while the woman was in the room, but when she went out she remarked on this change. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s all right,\" said Mrs. Staunton. \"I pay half a crown a week extra, and the landlady now waits on us. It is much more comfortable, I assure you, Effie, and worth the extra bit of money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Effie colored; she gave Agnes a reproachful glance, but did not say anything. \\n\\n \\n\\n Agnes turned her back with a little sniff. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Effie,\" she said suddenly, \"How coarse your hands have got! What in the world have you been doing?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Effie laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Polishing, cleaning, and scrubbing,\" she said. \"In short, doing very much what Mrs. Robinson\u0027s little maid of all-work does down in the kitchen here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear, dear!\" exclaimed Agnes; \"if those are a nurse\u0027s duties, you won\u0027t catch me going in for that sort of profession.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s awfully interesting,\" said Effie. \"I have, of course to begin at the bottom, but I like it very much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n While she was speaking, there came a knock at the door. George went to open it, and a young man came in. George brought him up to introduce him to his mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is my great friend, Fred Lawson, mother,\" he said. \"Effie, let me introduce you to Lawson—Lawson, this is my sister Effie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Effie bowed. She felt the color rushing all over her face. Lawson was the man whom George had wronged in some mysterious way. Lawson was the man for whom that dreadful ￡250 was required. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1497/44730.html","bookId":662,"book":{"id":662,"title":"A Girl in Ten Thousand","description":"简介： The speaker was a middle-aged woman.
