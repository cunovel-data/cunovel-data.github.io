{"id":111961,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Lizzie called me a bloody idiot for coming here today. She said I was mad going into town and now I\u0027m here I have to agree. I wanted to stay at home but I had no choice. I\u0027ve had too much time off recently. I was disciplined because of my absence record a couple of months back and now I don\u0027t get paid if I don\u0027t go in. They\u0027ve threatened to kick me out if I don\u0027t turn up for work, and no matter how much I hate this job I can\u0027t afford to lose it. Maybe I\u0027ll be the only one who turns up today. Maybe I should just take a chance and turn round and go back home anyway. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s worse - the thought of sitting through another disciplinary meeting with Barry Penny and Tina or risking getting caught up in the kind of trouble we saw here last night.\\n\\n The streets are quieter today. There are still plenty of people around but it feels more like a Sunday morning than a Wednesday. Everyone is silent and subdued and hardly anyone is talking to anyone else. I understand why it\u0027s like this. I don\u0027t want to talk to anyone either. I don\u0027t want to risk making any contact - even just looking at them - if there\u0027s a chance trouble\u0027s going to flare up. I keep my head down and my mouth shut and I guess that\u0027s what everyone else is doing too.\\n\\n This feels bizarre. Last night when we were coming home from the hospital and later when I was talking to Harry it began to feel like the world was falling apart and coming to an end. The reality this morning feels different. Despite the quiet and the lack of conversation everything appears outwardly normal. It\u0027s hard to believe the things we\u0027ve seen and heard about.\\n\\n I cross Millennium Square to get to the office. It\u0027s a huge expanse of block-paving with a horrible modern fountain stuck right in the middle of it. It\u0027s right in the centre of town and people cross it from all directions to get to wherever it is they\u0027re supposed to be going. It\u0027s always busy. Between eight o\u0027clock and nine in the morning, midday and two in the afternoon and pretty much anytime after four o\u0027clock right through to the early hours this place is choc full of people. If there\u0027s a place you\u0027d expect something to happen, this is it. Maybe I should have avoided it today, but that would have added at least another ten minutes to my walk to work and I\u0027m running late as it is. It looks as if the authorities are ready for trouble. There are more police officers patrolling around here than I\u0027ve ever seen on duty before and most, if not all of them, are armed. That might be normal elsewhere in the world but not here. Jesus, seeing officers walking through the crowd with their semi-automatic weapons primed and ready to fire makes me realise just how dangerous and unpredictable the situation now is. But surely their presence will just add to the problem, not diffuse it?\\n\\n My last couple of minutes of freedom before I reach the office.\\n\\n What is causing this to happen? As I walk through the silent, stony-faced crowds I can\u0027t help but wonder again what\u0027s responsible for all this madness and hysteria. What is it that\u0027s turning the world on its head? Has this whole situation been manufactured by the media as Lizzie\u0027s dad believes or is there more to it? Has anything really happened at all? Are people running scared from something that doesn\u0027t even exist? Or is there something in the water? Has something been sprayed into the air by terrorists? Are we living through some bizarre \u0027Invasion of the Body Snatchers\u0027 type scenario?\\n\\n Or is it something worse than all of that?\\n\\n Midday.\\n\\n Less than half of the staff turned up for work today. I\u0027ve tried to keep my head down as much as I can. Keeping busy makes the time go faster and I want today to pass as quickly as possible. I briefly spoke to Liz an hour or so ago. The school is closed again. They tried to open this morning but only half the children turned up and even fewer staff so Lizzie is spending another day stuck at home with the kids. They\u0027re driving her crazy but I know she\u0027s happier there. Wish I was back there too.\\n\\n The lack of staff today means we\u0027re all stretched. Jennifer Reynolds is one of the people who hasn\u0027t turned up and that\u0027s meant all of us taking turns to cover Reception in hour-long shifts. If ever there was a day I didn\u0027t want to be out there it\u0027s today. Even Tina\u0027s had to take a turn. I\u0027ve just finished my shift and Hilary Turner has come out to relieve me. I like Hilary. She\u0027s a sour-faced, frosty old spinster who\u0027s grossly overweight but she knows who does what around here and she doesn\u0027t take any crap. Unlike most of the other people I work with she\u0027s straight and honest. If she\u0027s got a problem with something you\u0027ve done then she\u0027ll tell you to your face - none of the backstabbing bullshit you get from everyone else. She\u0027s hard as nails and I like her all the better for it.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s been quiet,\u0027 I tell her as she waddles towards me. \u0027No-one\u0027s been in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s the kiss of death,\u0027 she grumbles as she slumps heavily into the hot-seat behind the desk, \u0027they\u0027ll all start dragging themselves in here now I\u0027ve come out.\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027m about to tell her to shut up and stop being stupid when the main door flies open. She might be right. There\u0027s a sudden flurry of movement as a man storms into the building. He\u0027s carrying a handful of papers which he slams down onto the desk in front of Hilary. She jumps back. This guy is furious. He\u0027s seething with anger and suddenly I\u0027m too scared to move. Is he one of them? Is he a Hater?\\n\\n \u0027Sort this out,\u0027 he screams. \u0027Sort this bloody mess out now!\u0027\\n\\n He slams his fist down on the counter again. His face is flushed red and he\u0027s breathing heavily. He\u0027s over six foot tall and he\u0027s built like a bloody rugby player. I should say something to him but I can\u0027t. I\u0027m silently willing Hilary to speak (she\u0027s usually good at dealing with this sort of thing) but she\u0027s struck dumb too.\\n\\n \u0027You fucking people have clamped my car,\u0027 he yells. \u0027There were no signs and no markings. This is an absolute fucking disgrace. I\u0027ve missed a meeting because of you people...\u0027\\n\\n I still can\u0027t move. He\u0027s still shouting but I\u0027ve stopped listening to what he\u0027s saying. I stare into his face and slowly shuffle further back until I\u0027m pressed up against the wall. Is this man really a Hater? Oh Christ, is he about to explode and kill us both? What the hell do I do? Do I just run? The man looks at Hilary and then at me. I try not to make eye contact but I can\u0027t help it. I can see Hilary out of the corner of my eye. She\u0027s shaking like a leaf. She\u0027s usually rock-hard but she\u0027s as frightened as I am. I have to do something.\\n\\n \u0027Look...\u0027 I start to say, my voice quiet and unsteady.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t give me any bullshit,\u0027 he snaps, his voice no quieter or calmer, \u0027I don\u0027t want any bullshit. Just get this sorted out and do it now. I need to get back to my office. I\u0027m at the end of my fucking tether here and if I don\u0027t get...\u0027\\n\\n He leans forward again and we both physically recoil.\\n\\n \u0027Please...\u0027 Hilary mumbles meekly. She starts to sob. Under the desk she presses the personal attack alarm. I can hear the high-pitched screech of the alert ringing out in the main office.\\n\\n The man stops. His expression changes. He hears the sound too. He looks from me to Hilary and back again once more. His eyes are suddenly wide with shock and panic. What the hell\u0027s he got to be afraid of? He\u0027s the one who came in here and...\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he says quickly, taking a couple of steps back away from the desk. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to...\u0027\\n\\n Realisation dawns.\\n\\n His voice is now at a fraction of its previous volume. Hilary and I are stood there, just waiting for him to explode again. Instead he crumbles. He realises that we\u0027re scared and now he\u0027s the one who\u0027s frightened that we\u0027re going to react.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not one of them,\u0027 he says, pleading with us to believe him. He looks like he has tears in his eyes. \u0027Honest I\u0027m not. The parking ticket made me mad and I just over-reacted, that\u0027s all. I\u0027m not a Hater. I don\u0027t want to fight. I\u0027m not going to hurt anyone...\u0027\\n\\n I still can\u0027t do anything. I\u0027m frozen to the spot. This whole situation feels alien and bizarre. It\u0027s an uneasy standoff which ends as quickly as it began. The man seems to be about to say something else but he doesn\u0027t. Instead he turns and walks out of the building, still clutching his parking ticket. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-15.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.

At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent.
