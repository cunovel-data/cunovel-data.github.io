Everybody seems to be thinking twice about everything they do and worrying more than normal about what everyone else is doing. Our ordinary lives and the day to day routine suddenly feel more complicated than they did before and yet I\u0027m still not even sure if anything\u0027s actually changed.\\n\\n I had a phone call from Lizzie just after I\u0027d been out for my lunch break today. We had an appointment to take Josh for a hospital check-up this afternoon and, with everything that happened at school yesterday, we\u0027d both forgotten about it. He fell off a chair at playgroup three weeks ago and cut his head open. The appointment was just to make sure that everything had healed properly and that he was fit and well. Lizzie had also forgotten to tell Harry that school was closed. He arrived on the doorstep at eight this morning expecting to be looking after Josh as usual. Liz arranged for him to drive her and Josh into town, then take Ellis and Ed back home. I said I\u0027d meet them at the hospital and we\u0027d travel home together after he\u0027d seen the doctor. I managed to convince Tina Murray that I needed to be at the appointment too. For once she bought my story without putting up much of a fight.\\n\\n Despite trying to make a quick getaway I was later getting away from the office than I should have been (I stopped to chat to someone) and it\u0027s taken me ages to get across town. Josh\u0027s appointment was at three o\u0027clock - three-quarters of an hour ago. Still, hospitals are always behind and with everything that\u0027s going on there\u0027s bound to be more delays than usual today. I bet he hasn\u0027t even gone in to see the doctor yet. I walk quickly down the sloping path which cuts through the car park. The hospital looks busy. The afternoon is dull and dark and bright yellow light shines out from the building\u0027s countless windows. It\u0027s a bloody grim place. I wouldn\u0027t want to have to stay here for...\\n\\n \u0027Danny!\u0027\\n\\n Who the hell was that? I turn around and see Lizzie walking towards me with Josh in his pushchair.\\n\\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 I ask, confused.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027ve you been?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I couldn\u0027t get here any earlier,\u0027 I answer, lying through my teeth. \u0027Have you only just got here?\u0027\\n\\n She shakes her head.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re joking, aren\u0027t you? We\u0027ve already been in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What, he\u0027s had his appointment?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was booked for three o\u0027clock. It\u0027s a good job you weren\u0027t taking him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know but...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve been waiting for you for the last twenty minutes. We were in and out in seconds. They rushed us through.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I...\u0027\\n\\n She shakes her head again and starts to push Josh up the hill back towards the main road.\\n\\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 she mumbles. Christ, she\u0027s in a bad mood.\\n\\n \u0027And is everything okay?\u0027 I ask, having to shout after her as she storms away. \u0027Is Josh all right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s fHe\u0027s fine,\u0027 she grunts back over her shoulder.\\n\\n The afternoon goes from bad to worse. Lizzie\u0027s talking to me again now but she\u0027s still not happy. Neither am I. We\u0027ve walked back across town to the station but there\u0027s been a problem with the lines and our train has been cancelled. We can\u0027t get Harry to collect us (there isn\u0027t enough room in the car) so the only option left is a long journey home on three buses. Liz has just phoned Harry and told him we\u0027ll be late back. By all accounts he\u0027s not at all impressed.\\n\\n The working day is drawing to a close. The light is fading and those office workers who finish at four o\u0027clock are already starting to crowd onto the streets. We need to get out of town quickly or we\u0027ll get caught up in the main rush hour crush.\\n\\n \u0027Which bus?\u0027 Lizzie asks, having to shout to make herself heard over the traffic.\\n\\n \u0027The 220,\u0027 I answer from just behind her. I\u0027m pushing Josh now and we seem to be moving in the opposite direction to almost every other pedestrian. It\u0027s hard to keep moving forward in a straight line. \u0027The stop\u0027s just up here.\u0027\\n\\n Our stop is halfway down a one-way street. Lizzie ducks into the shelter and I follow. Josh is moaning. He\u0027s cold and hungry.\\n\\n \u0027Look, I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t make it to the hospital on time,\u0027 I say. \u0027Things are difficult at the moment. You know what it\u0027s like when...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 she interrupts, obviously not interested in my explanations.\\n\\n I peer down the street as a bus appears. I hopefully squint into the distance to make out the number but it\u0027s not ours. I slump into the shelter again.\\n\\n \u0027So what did the doctor say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing much. We were in and out in five minutes. His head\u0027s healed as it should have and there\u0027s no lasting damage. He\u0027ll have a small scar but it\u0027ll be hidden by his hair.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s good,\u0027 I say, looking down at Josh who, somehow, now looks like he\u0027s about to fall asleep. \u0027It\u0027s a relief. You can never be sure when they hurt themselves like that...\u0027\\n\\n I stop talking when a sudden stampede of footsteps thunders past the bus stop. A group of six men are chasing after a single shaven-headed figure who is desperately trying to get away. He\u0027s wearing jeans and a white T-shirt which is covered in blood. Two of the men barge past us and almost knock Lizzie over.\\n\\n \u0027Watch where you\u0027re going you fucking idiots!\u0027 I shout after them. I immediately regret opening my mouth. Lizzie glares at me. Thankfully both of the men keep running and neither of them reacts.\\n\\n The man they\u0027re all chasing sprints into the street and runs immediately into the path of a taxi which blasts its horn and flashes its lights at him. The driver swerves and skids to a halt and somehow manages to avoid a collision. The man pushes himself away off the bonnet of the taxi and turns and starts to run down the middle of the road. But the slight delay is his downfall and the group of men following are onto him like wild animals chasing down their prey. My heart is in my mouth. The rest of the world seems to have stopped still.\\n\\n The nearest of the chasing pack reaches out and manages to grab hold of the man\u0027s sleeve. With a single strong yank he pulls the desperate figure backwards. He trips over his own feet and falls in a crumpled heap on the dotted white line in the middle of the road.\\n\\n \u0027Fucking scum,\u0027 I hear one of the other men shout. \u0027You fucking Hater scum.\u0027\\n\\n They encircle the lone runner and batter him. They kick and hit him relentlessly. I look at Lizzie and she stares back at me, her eyes wide with shock and fear. Does she expect me to do something? There\u0027s no way I\u0027m getting involved. I look around and see that no-one else is doing anything either. The traffic has ground to a halt and many of the pedestrians on either side of the road have stopped walking.\\n\\n The beating lasts for less than a minute. They surround him and batter him from every side and every angle kicking his face, his kidneys, his chest and his bollocks and stamping on his head, his kneecaps and his outstretched hands. Once the frenzied attack is over the man\u0027s breathless assailants step back, leaving the twitching body on the ground in full view. The wail of approaching sirens shatters the heavy and ominous silence. I look back down the road and see that a police motorbike is weaving through the stationary traffic. By the time the police officer reaches the body all but one of the attackers have disappeared into the crowds. The one who remains stands his ground and shouts and screams at the officer and points accusingly at the helpless, broken man on the road before turning and running after the others. With a bizarre lack of urgency, interest and care the police officer drags the body away from the middle of the road and leaves it in the gutter before signalling to the traffic to start moving again.\\n\\n The world slowly starts to crank itself back into action.\\n\\n Lizzie is holding onto my arm, gripping me so tight that it hurts. I can\u0027t take my eyes off the dark mound at the side of the road. Who was it? What had he done? If he really was a Hater then he deserved everything he got.\\n\\n It seems like every time we go out now something happens.\\n\\n I think back to the television programme we watched last night, and then I think about the other attacks I\u0027ve seen and those I\u0027ve heard about. All that bullshit I came out with last night suddenly seems to count for nothing. There is something more to this. This isn\u0027t just paranoia or people exploiting the situation.\\n\\n I feel sick with nerves and fear.\\n\\n Who is it going to happen to next? Me? Lizzie? Harry or one of the kids? Someone at work? It could be anyone. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-13.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
