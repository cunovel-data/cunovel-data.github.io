{"id":111958,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"It\u0027s past ten o\u0027clock before we know it. The children are finally settled and asleep and the flat is silent. The television has been off all evening but now the living room is too quiet so I switch it on just so that we have some background noise. Liz is subdued and preoccupied and we\u0027ve hardly talked. It\u0027s getting late. It won\u0027t be long before we go to bed. Before we know it I\u0027ll be up again and back into the grind. Sometimes I feel like I\u0027m running at a different speed to the rest of the world. I feel like I\u0027m always having to go flat out just to keep up.\n I go to the kitchen and make us both a drink. I take Lizzie\u0027s through to her.\n \u0027Drink.\u0027\n She looks up and smiles and takes the cup from me.\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 I ask.\n \u0027Of course I am. Why do you keep asking me if I\u0027m okay?\u0027\n \u0027Just want to be sure you\u0027re all right. You\u0027ve had a shitty day.\u0027\n \u0027I have but I\u0027m okay,\u0027 she says, her voice a little edgy and tense.\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 I grumble, overreacting, \u0027sorry I asked.\u0027\n \u0027Oh come on, don\u0027t be like that...\u0027\n \u0027Be like what? I only asked if you were okay, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n I sit down next to her. She stretches out her arm behind me and begins to gently rub my back.\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027\n Same old rubbish on TV. I pick up the remote and work my way through the channels. The comedies aren\u0027t funny tonight and the dramas are too dramatic. Nothing seems to suit the mood. I head for the news. I want to find out more about what\u0027s been going on. Apart from hearing the odd snippet of information at work today this is the first chance I\u0027ve had all day to catch up. What we see is more of what we saw yesterday - more trouble and more violence. What we don\u0027t get is any explanation. Each individual report seems to follow a pretty standard format - one or more incidents take place in a particular area and they report how people react to the fall-out. This is insane. I keep hearing phrases like \u0027copycat violence\u0027 and \u0027revenge attacks\u0027 being banded around. Are people really as stupid as Harry tried to suggest yesterday? Would anyone really want to start trouble just because they\u0027ve seen others doing it?\n \u0027Look at that,\u0027 Lizzie says as we stare at the headlines together, \u0027they\u0027re even giving them a name now. How\u0027s that going to help?\u0027\n She\u0027s right. I heard the word used a few minutes earlier but didn\u0027t think anything of it. The minority who are causing the trouble have been branded \u0027Haters\u0027. It came from a tabloid newspaper headline that was published this morning and it\u0027s quickly stuck. It seems appropriate because there\u0027s still no mention of these people fighting for any cause or reason. Hate seems to be just about the only thing driving them.\n \u0027They have to give them a name,\u0027 I mumble. \u0027It makes it easier for them to talk about it if they give them a name.\u0027\n Lizzie shakes her head in disbelief.\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand any of this.\u0027\n \u0027Nor me.\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re talking about it like it\u0027s an epidemic. How can it be? It\u0027s not a disease, for Christ\u0027s sake.\u0027\n \u0027It might be.\u0027\n \u0027I doubt it. But there has to be a reason for all of it, doesn\u0027t there?\u0027\n She\u0027s right, but like everyone else I have no idea what that reason might be so I don\u0027t bother answering. Watching the news makes me feel increasingly uneasy. It\u0027s making me feel like shutting the front door and not opening it again until all of this sudden violence and disruption has stopped. I instinctively start trying to come up with an explanation to try and make myself feel better if nothing else.\n \u0027Maybe it\u0027s not as bad as they\u0027re making it out to be,\u0027 I suggest.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027They always exaggerate things on the TV, don\u0027t they? They\u0027ve just been saying something about an increase in the number of violent incidents being reported, but that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean there\u0027s been any increase in the number of incidents actually taking place, does it?\u0027\n \u0027Not necessarily,\u0027 she says, sounding unsure.\n \u0027There might have been just as many fights as last week, but they weren\u0027t newsworthy then. Problem is when something like this makes the headlines people start jumping on the bandwagon.\u0027\n \u0027What are you saying?\u0027\n \u0027Maybe this whole situation is something the TV and newspapers have created,\u0027 I say. I\u0027m making this up as I\u0027m going along.\n \u0027It can\u0027t be. Something\u0027s definitely happening out there. There are too many coincidences for...\u0027\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 I interrupt, \u0027but if they haven\u0027t created the problem they\u0027re definitely making it worse.\u0027\n \u0027What about what happened at the concert on Friday? And in the pub? And whatever was going on with that car last night and what happened at school this morning... are you saying that all those things would have happened anyway? Do you think we\u0027re reading more into them just because of what we\u0027ve seen on TV?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s no way of telling, is there? All I\u0027m saying is that we\u0027ve seen things like this get out of control before.\u0027\n \u0027Have we?\u0027\n \u0027Of course we have. It happens all the time. Someone somewhere broadcasts a story, then a brain-dead section of the audience copy just to try and get themselves on TV or on the front pages of the papers.\u0027\n Now I think I\u0027ve really lost her. I can tell from the expression on her face that she doesn\u0027t understand. Either that or she doesn\u0027t believe me. I\u0027m not entirely sure about this myself.\n \u0027Don\u0027t get you.\u0027\n \u0027Remember dangerous dogs?\u0027 I ask. She shakes her head and screws up her face again. \u0027A few years back a kid round here got attacked by their neighbour\u0027s pet Rottweiler, remember? The kid\u0027s face got all messed up and she needed surgery I think. They had the dog put down.\u0027\n \u0027So? What\u0027s that got to do with what\u0027s happening now?\u0027\n \u0027Point is until that story broke hardly anyone had heard anything about dogs attacking kids, had they? But as soon as it made the papers there were suddenly stories about the same thing happening all over the place. There was a bloody epidemic of dogs attacking kids. Now you only hear about it happening once in a blue moon again.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s your point? Are you saying that those kids didn\u0027t get attacked?\u0027\n \u0027No, nothing like that. I guess what I\u0027m saying is that things like that must happen all the time but no-one\u0027s interested. As soon as it makes the news, though, people start to report it and before you know it you\u0027ve got dogs biting kids on every street corner.\u0027\n \u0027Not sure if I agree with you,\u0027 she says quietly. \u0027Still not even sure I know what you\u0027re talking about. There\u0027s never been anything on this scale before...\u0027\n \u0027I think that these idiots,\u0027 I explain, pointing at the TV, \u0027are doing more harm than good. By giving these people a label and giving them airtime they\u0027re glorifying whatever it is that\u0027s happening and blowing it out of all proportion. People are seeing the violence and the glory and rebellion on TV and they\u0027re thinking, I\u0027ll have some of that.\u0027\n \u0027Bullshit. You\u0027re starting to sound like Dad.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s not bullshit. Remember those riots last summer?\u0027 I ask, luckily managing to think of another example to try and strengthen my tenuous argument. About eight months ago there was a string of race-motivated disturbances in a few major cities, ours included. Lizzie nods her head.\n \u0027What about them?\u0027\n \u0027Same thing again. Someone started a little bit of trouble out of the way in some back-street somewhere. The media got hold of it and the problem was made to look a hundred times worse than it ever was. It was the way they reported it that made it spread and maybe that\u0027s what\u0027s happening now. There\u0027s a genuine problem somewhere that gets reported and before you know it you\u0027ve got mobs in every city starting trouble using whatever it was that caused the very first fight to kick off as an excuse to get involved.\u0027\n \u0027And do you really believe that?\u0027\n I stay quiet. I don\u0027t honestly know what I believe.\n \u0027I think you\u0027re talking crap,\u0027 she snaps. \u0027None of what you\u0027ve said explains why I watched a perfectly healthy and normal eleven year-old boy beat the hell out of the headteacher this morning, does it?\u0027\n I still stay quiet. I\u0027m relieved when, at long last, something different happens on the news channel. The usual presenters behind their expensive-looking desk have suddenly disappeared and we\u0027re now watching a round table discussion between four people who are probably all politicians or experts in some field or other. They\u0027ve already been talking for a couple of minutes so we\u0027ve missed the introductions.\n \u0027What are they going to be able to tell us?\u0027 I grumble. \u0027How can these people be experts if no-one knows what\u0027s happening yet?\u0027\n \u0027Just shut up so we can listen,\u0027 Lizzie sighs.\n I can\u0027t help being sceptical. The whole set-up reminds me of the start of that film \u0027Dawn of the Dead\u0027 where the views of another so-called expert are ripped apart by a non-believing TV presenter. I know we\u0027re not dealing with a zombie apocalypse here but the way these people are talking to each other makes it feel eerily similar. No-one\u0027s backing up what they say with any facts. No-one has anything to offer other than half-baked theories and ideas. No-one seems to believe what anyone else is saying.\n \u0027The police force is already operating at full stretch and our hospitals are struggling to cope with the increase in injuries,\u0027 a grey-haired lady is saying. \u0027The situation must be brought under control soon or we will not have the capacity to react. If this situation continues indefinitely and at the rate of increase we\u0027re presently seeing we\u0027ll be in danger of reaching saturation point where we simply will not be able to deal with what\u0027s happening.\u0027\n \u0027But what is happening?\u0027 someone finally asks. It\u0027s a middle-aged man. I think he\u0027s a doctor. Not sure if he\u0027s a medic or a shrink. \u0027Surely our priority must be to identify the cause and resolve that first.\u0027\n \u0027I think with this situation the cause and the effect are one and the same,\u0027 a small, balding man (who, I believe, is a fairly senior politician) says. \u0027People are reacting to what they see on the streets, and their reactions are making the situation appear far worse than it actually is.\u0027\n \u0027See,\u0027 I say, nudging Liz.\n \u0027Shh...\u0027 she hisses.\n \u0027Do you seriously believe that?\u0027 the other man challenges. \u0027Do you really believe that any of this is happening purely as a result of the violence we\u0027ve already seen?\u0027\n \u0027The violence is a by-product,\u0027 the grey-haired lady says.\n \u0027The violence is part and parcel of the problem,\u0027 the politician argues. \u0027The violence is the problem. Once we\u0027ve restored order we can start to...\u0027\n \u0027The violence is a by-product,\u0027 the grey-haired lady says again, annoyed that she\u0027s been interrupted. \u0027You\u0027re right in as far as there is a huge element of copycat violence, but the violence is not the cause. There\u0027s an underlying reason for what\u0027s happening which needs to be identified before...\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s no evidence to suggest that\u0027s the case,\u0027 the politician says quickly.\n \u0027There\u0027s no published evidence to suggest that\u0027s the case,\u0027 the middle-aged man snaps, \u0027but how much unpublished information is being withheld? This is unprecedented. With an escalation in trouble of this scale there has to be an identifiable cause, doesn\u0027t there? For this to be happening independently in so many different geographical regions there has to be an identifiable cause.\u0027\n \u0027If you look at what we\u0027ve seen over the last few days,\u0027 the politician says, shaking his head, \u0027there has been a steady increase in the recorded levels of violence around major cities where there are high population levels. This is wholly expected. With situations like this the more people who are concentrated in a particular geographic area, the more likely it is that trouble will develop there...\u0027\n I stop listening. I sense that this bureaucrat is launching into some pre-arranged spiel in which he\u0027ll no doubt deny all cover-ups and hidden agendas. This sounds like more bullshit. The other people taking part in the debate challenge him but, although he squirms and struggles to keep control, he ultimately remains tight-lipped. I get the feeling that this programme might have been arranged as a public relations exercise but it\u0027s failing miserably. The politician\u0027s unease and the way he\u0027s blatantly avoiding the questions people are putting to him means one of two things. Either the government knows full well what\u0027s happening and is simply choosing not to tell the public, or the authorities genuinely don\u0027t have a clue. Both alternatives are equally frightening.\n Twenty minutes more of the news channel and my eyes are starting to close. The debate is over and the headlines are back on. They say that the military may be drafted in to help maintain law and order if the police do become over-stretched as the grey-haired panellist suggested in the debate earlier. They also say that the problem is largely limited to major cities and there are, as yet, no reports of it spreading to other countries. Most worryingly of all, there\u0027s talk of an after-dark curfew and other restrictions being introduced to keep people off the streets and out of each other\u0027s faces.\n It\u0027s what isn\u0027t being said that bothers me. I\u0027m just concerned that no-one seems to have a clue what\u0027s going on.\n TUESDAY\n vi\n Jeremy Pearson felt like he was about to be sick. He\u0027d been okay when he\u0027d been prepped for the operation, but now he was actually lying on the table in the operating theatre with people crowding around him and machines beeping and buzzing and that huge round light hanging over him he was beginning to feel nauseous and faint. I should have gone for the general anaesthetic not a local, he thought to himself as Dr Panesar the surgeon walked towards him. I\u0027m paying enough for this operation as it is, a general anaesthetic wouldn\u0027t have cost that much more...\n \u0027Okay, Mr Pearson,\u0027 he said through his green cloth facemask, \u0027how are you feeling?\u0027\n \u0027Not too good,\u0027 Pearson mumbled, too afraid to move. He tensed his body underneath the sheet and gown which covered him.\n \u0027This won\u0027t take too long,\u0027 Dr Panesar explained, ignoring his patient\u0027s nerves. \u0027You\u0027re the fourth vasectomy I\u0027ve done today and none of them have lasted much longer than half an hour so far. We\u0027ll have you out of here before you know it.\u0027\n Pearson didn\u0027t respond. He was feeling faint. Maybe it was the heat in the theatre or was it just the thought of what was about to happen that was making him feel like this? Was this normal? Was he having a reaction to the anaesthetic they\u0027d used to numb the feeling in his balls?\n \u0027I don\u0027t feel...\u0027 he tried to say to the female nurse who stood next to him, holding onto his arm. She looked down and, seeing that he was struggling, slipped an oxygen mask over his face.\n \u0027You\u0027ll be fine,\u0027 she soothed. \u0027Have a bit of air and try and think about something else.\u0027\n Pearson tried to answer but his words were muffled under the mask. How can I think about something else when someone\u0027s about to cut into my balls?\n \u0027Do you follow cricket?\u0027 an older male nurse on his other side asked. Pearson nodded. \u0027Have you seen the tour report today? We\u0027re not doing too badly by all accounts.\u0027\n The oxygen was beginning to take the edge off his nausea. That\u0027s better. Starting to feel more relaxed now...\n \u0027Okay, Mr Pearson,\u0027 Dr Panesar said brightly, looking up from the area of the operation. \u0027We\u0027re ready to start now. I explained what I\u0027m going to do in clinic, didn\u0027t I? This is a very small procedure. I\u0027ll just be making two incisions, one on either side of your scrotum, okay?\u0027\n Pearson nodded. I don\u0027t want to know what you\u0027re doing, he thought, just bloody well get on with it.\n \u0027You feeling a bit better now?\u0027 the female nurse asked, gently stroking the back of his hand. He nodded again and she removed the oxygen mask. He could feel the surgeon working now. Although his genitals were anaesthetised, he could still feel movement around his legs and occasionally someone brushed against the tips of his toes sticking out over the end of the operating table. More nausea. He was starting to feel sick again. Christ, think of something to take your mind off this, he silently screamed to himself. He tried to fill his head with images and thoughts - the children, his wife Emily, the holiday they\u0027d booked for a few weeks time, the new car he\u0027d picked up last week... anything. As hard as he tried he still couldn\u0027t forget the fact that someone was cutting into his scrotum with a scalpel.\n Is this how I\u0027m supposed to feel, Pearson thought? I\u0027m cold. I don\u0027t feel right. Should it be like this or is something going wrong?\n \u0027Don\u0027t feel right...\u0027 he mumbled. The nurse looked down and slammed the oxygen mask on his face again. The sudden movement made Dr Panesar look up.\n \u0027Everything okay up there?\u0027 he asked, his voice artificially bright and animated. \u0027You all right Mr Pearson?\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s fine,\u0027 the nurse replied, her voice equally artificially trouble-free, \u0027a little light-headed, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Nothing to worry about,\u0027 the surgeon said as he took a step around the edge of the table and looked into his patient\u0027s face. Pearson\u0027s wide, frightened eyes were dancing around the room, squinting into the bright lights which shone down over his prone body. Dr Panesar stopped and stared at him.\n \u0027Dr Panesar?\u0027 the nurse asked.\n Nothing.\n \u0027Is everything all right, Dr Panesar?\u0027\n Panesar stumbled back to the other end of the table, his eyes still fixed on Pearson\u0027s face.\n \u0027You okay, Dr Panesar?\u0027 his surgical assistant asked. No response. \u0027Dr Panesar,\u0027 he asked again, \u0027are you okay?\u0027\n Panesar turned to look at his colleague and then tightened the grip on the scalpel in his hand. Crouching back down again he slashed across Pearson\u0027s exposed genitals and severed his testicles and scrotal sac. Blood began to spill and spurt over the operating table from sliced veins and arteries.\n \u0027What the hell are you doing?\u0027 the surgical assistant demanded. He pushed Panesar out of the way and moved to grab his hand and wrestle the scalpel from him. Delirious with fear, Panesar turned and sliced the man with the blade, cutting him open in a diagonal line down from his right shoulder.\n Panic erupted in the operating theatre. The staff scattered as the surgeon lunged towards them. Pearson lay helplessly on the operating table, turning his head desperately from side to side, trying to see what was happening around him. Covered in blood and still brandishing the scalpel Panesar fled from the room. Pearson watched him run. What the hell was going on? Christ, he suddenly felt strange. He felt cold and shaky but his legs felt warm. And why were people panicking? Why all the sudden movement? Why had the nurses gone to the other end of the table and where was all that blood coming from?\n Still anaesthetised and oblivious and ignorant both to the pandemonium which was rapidly spreading through the private hospital and the fact that he was rapidly bleeding to death, Pearson looked up into the light and tried to think of anything but the fact that his surgeon had just disappeared in the middle of his vasectomy. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-12.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Hater (Hater #1) \n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
