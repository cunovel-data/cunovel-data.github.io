{"id":111969,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"The lobby is silent. I shut the door to the flat behind me, lock it and cautiously look around. I\u0027ve told Liz to make a safe room like they said on TV and then to shut herself and the kids in it. The living room is the obvious place. She\u0027s closed the curtains and they\u0027ve turned the TV down low. From outside it looks like no-one\u0027s in.\\n\\n I open the front door and cringe as the usual loud creaking sound echoes around the insides of the empty building.\\n\\n \u0027Is anyone there?\u0027 a voice hisses from the darkness upstairs. I freeze and try not to panic. What do I do? I want to keep moving and pretend I didn\u0027t hear anything but I can\u0027t. My family is in this building and I can\u0027t leave them knowing that someone else is in here with them. It could be anyone. They could be waiting for me to leave so they can get to Lizzie and the kids. But why would they have shouted out like that? I let the door go and it creaks again as it swings shut. I take a few slow steps back into the shadows and, for a second, I think about going back into the flat. I know that\u0027s not going to achieve anything. I have to go out and get Harry at some point.\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s there?\u0027 I hiss back, cursing myself for my stupidity. I\u0027m acting like a character in a bad horror movie. You\u0027re supposed to run away from the monster, I tell myself, not move towards it.\\n\\n \u0027Up here,\u0027 the voice answers. I look up towards the top of the staircase and the first floor landing. There\u0027s a face staring back at me from between the metal struts of the banister. It\u0027s one of the men from the flat on the top floor. I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s Gary or Chris. I start to cautiously climb the stairs. I\u0027m almost on the landing when the steps beneath my feet become tacky. The floor\u0027s covered in sticky puddles of blood. The man from the flat is lying on the ground in front of me, clutching his chest. He grunts and rolls over onto his back. His jeans and T-shirt are soaked through with blood. He turns his head to one side and manages to acknowledge me. He relaxes, relieved that someone\u0027s finally with him I suppose. He\u0027s in a real mess and I don\u0027t know where to start. Is there anything I can do for him or am I too late?\\n\\n \u0027Thanks, mate,\u0027 he gasps, propping himself up onto his elbows. \u0027I\u0027ve been stuck here for hours. I heard someone come in a while back and I was trying to get...\u0027 He stops speaking and collapses and lies flat on his back again. The effort is too much. His voice gurgles and rasps. There must be blood in his throat. What am I supposed to do? Christ, I haven\u0027t got a clue how to try and help him.\\n\\n \u0027Do you want me to try and get you back upstairs?\u0027 I ask uselessly. He shakes his head and swallows to clear his throat.\\n\\n \u0027No point,\u0027 he groans as he tries to prop himself up again. I put my hand on his shoulder to keep him still. \u0027I want a drink,\u0027 he says. \u0027Can you go up to the flat and get me a beer?\u0027\\n\\n His eyes flutter for a second and I wonder if he\u0027s about to go. I get up quickly and climb the stairs to the top floor flat he shares with the other man. I follow a snail trail of dry blood along the hallway and into the living room of the flat which is otherwise surprisingly clean and well-kept. Don\u0027t know why I expected anything else really. There\u0027s an upturned table in the middle of the room and next to it a smashed lamp. There\u0027s a video camera on a tripod next to a computer and a wide-screen TV. Looks like they enjoyed filming themselves here. There\u0027s an expensive looking leather sofa and... and I realise that I\u0027m standing here checking out the flat while one of its occupants lies dying at the bottom of the stairs. Forcing myself to move I go to the kitchen and grab a bottle of beer from the well-stocked fridge. I open it and run back down to the man on the first floor landing.\\n\\n \u0027Here you go,\u0027 I say as I hold the bottle up to his mouth. I\u0027m not sure how much he manages to swallow. Most of it seems to run down his chin. When I move the bottle away I see that its neck is covered in blood from his lips. What am I supposed to do now? I try to move him but it\u0027s no good. He moans with pain whenever I touch him. This poor bastard is dying as I\u0027m watching and there\u0027s absolutely nothing I can do to help him. There\u0027s no point asking who did this to him or if there\u0027s anyone I can try and contact - the sudden exit of his lover / friend / business partner early this morning was a clear enough admission of guilt. I feel terrible as I stand next to him, trying to think of an excuse to leave as he lies dying at my feet. But what else can I do?\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll go and get help,\u0027 I say quietly, crouching down closer to him again, taking care not to get any of his blood on me. \u0027I\u0027ll go and find someone who\u0027ll be able to help you.\u0027\\n\\n He licks his blood-stained lips, swallows and shakes his head.\\n\\n \u0027Too late now,\u0027 he wheezes. Every move this poor sod makes is taking masses of effort and causing him huge amounts of pain. I wish he\u0027d just shut up and lie still but he won\u0027t. He has something more to say. Exhausted, he turns his head towards me again and stares straight into my face.\\n\\n \u0027Just keep still and...\u0027 I start to say.\\n\\n \u0027I tried to get him,\u0027 he says breathlessly. \u0027Fucker had a knife on him just in case. He got me first.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I tried to get him but he was ready for me...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are you saying? Did he attack you? Was he a Hater?\u0027\\n\\n He shakes his head.\\n\\n \u0027You see everything so clearly when it happens to you. I had to kill him. It was him or me. I had to kill him before...\u0027\\n\\n I stand up and start to move away. Jesus Christ, is this the Hater? He\u0027s the one who started the trouble we heard last night. He\u0027s the one who lost control. Christ, I\u0027m stood here wasting my time on a fucking Hater.\\n\\n He licks his bloody lips again and swallows once more.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s them mate,\u0027 he mumbles, \u0027not us. They\u0027re the ones who hate. Get yourself ready...\u0027\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what the hell he\u0027s talking about now and I don\u0027t want to hear any more. I need to get away from this sick piece of filth. I turn my back on him and run downstairs, safe in the knowledge that there\u0027s no way he\u0027ll be able to reach my family in the condition he\u0027s in. I think about finishing him off but that would make me as bad as them and I doubt whether I\u0027d even be able to do it. I glance back and take one last look at the scum on the landing. He hasn\u0027t got long left. He\u0027ll be dead by the time I get back and it won\u0027t be a moment too soon.\\n\\n I run out to the car and start the engine. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-23.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults. Christened “Haters” by the media, the attackers strike without warning and seemingly without reason. Within seconds, normally rational, self-controlled people become frenzied, vicious killers. As the carnage mounts, one thing soon is clear: everyone, irrespective of race, gender, age, or class, has the potential to become either a Hater or a victim. At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent. In the face of this mindless terror, all McCoyne can do is secure his family, seek shelter, and watch as the world falls apart. But when he bolts the front door, the question remains: Is he shutting the danger out or locking it in?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/hater-hater-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:58 AM"}}
