{"id":111980,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"I feel like I\u0027ve been running for miles but I\u0027ve slowed down now. I\u0027ve reached the edge of town and there are fewer buildings and shadows to hide in. I don\u0027t want to be seen. I could have taken a car but there\u0027s nothing else on the roads now and I would have drawn too much attention to myself. I\u0027ve lost track of time. It\u0027s early evening and the light has almost completely gone. I\u0027m cold, soaked through by the heavy rain that\u0027s been falling for the last hour or so, but that\u0027s just a minor physical discomfort and I still feel surprisingly strong.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ve been outside now but so far I\u0027ve seen only a couple of other people. The air is still full of noise as the military try to expose us and flush us out into the open but the streets are empty. I know there\u0027s supposed to be a curfew at night but I\u0027m sure that\u0027s not the only reason why there\u0027s no-one around. Being out in the open is too dangerous. Those few people I have seen - the occasional solitary figure that creeps carefully through the shadows like me - I have kept away from. I don\u0027t want to risk making contact with anyone. Will they be like me? Perhaps they will but I can\u0027t afford to take any chances. They could be like the rest of them. I\u0027ll kill again if I have to but I\u0027m not looking for trouble. Finding Ellis is more important. Tonight it feels as if the \u0027normal\u0027 part of the population have been driven into hiding in fear of us.\\n\\n I think I\u0027m probably about halfway between my flat and Liz\u0027s sister\u0027s house now. I had planned to walk all night but I think it will be sensible to stop and take cover soon. There are helicopters over the city again now and I feel exposed. Instinct tells me it\u0027ll soon be too much of a risk to be out alone in the darkness with the military swarming through the streets and the skies. If I thought it was safe to keep going I would. I\u0027ll take this opportunity to rest for a while and eat.\\n\\n I can\u0027t stop thinking about Ellis. My poor little girl is stuck in the middle of a group of people who will turn against her at any time and without any warning. She\u0027s in danger and there\u0027s nothing I can do to help her. It might already be too late but I can\u0027t allow myself to think like that. I\u0027ve consciously tried to block them from my mind but I find myself thinking about Lizzie, Edward and Josh again. Remembering them fills me with an overpowering sadness and remorse. I wonder if they might eventually change too? Could whatever has changed within me be buried somewhere inside them also? I\u0027d like to believe it could but I don\u0027t hold out much hope. The government information I read earlier (if any of it was correct) said that just a small percentage of the population were likely to be affected. I sensed a difference between Ellis and the others too. She and I are alike. We\u0027re different to them, I can feel it. I have to accept that the rest of my family are lost.\\n\\n I\u0027m heading out of the city now. I look back over my shoulder and see that although there are still lights on in many buildings, there are also huge swathes of town which are bathed in darkness. The power must be down. It\u0027s inevitable, I suppose. This \u0027change\u0027 (whatever it is) might only be affecting a minority, but it\u0027s repercussions are being felt everywhere. It\u0027s tearing society apart as quickly as it destroyed my family.\\n\\n I turn a corner and walk straight into another body coming the other way, the first person I\u0027ve come across for some time. I immediately tense myself, ready for the kill. I push the dark figure back and clench my fists ready to strike. I stare through the darkness into the other person\u0027s face and... and it\u0027s okay. There is no anger, no hate and no threat. The mutual unspoken feeling of relief is immense. This person is like me and we both know that neither of us has anything to fear from the other.\\n\\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 I ask, keeping my voice low.\\n\\n The other person nods and walks on.\\n\\n I can hear engines in the distance. The military are still moving through the dark city behind me and they are closer now. There are more helicopters crawling through the sky too. I can see four of them hovering ominously, sweeping over the streets and occasionally illuminating the ground below them with impossibly bright spotlights. It\u0027s definitely time to get under cover.\\n\\n I cross over a low stone bridge which spans a silent railway track. Ahead of me is the dark silhouette of a huge factory or warehouse and, on the other side of the road, a building site. As I get closer I see that it\u0027s the beginnings of a new housing estate. There are a few houses almost completed just off the main road and they are surrounded by the shells of other partially constructed buildings. The half-built walls and wooden frames jutting up into the air make it hard to tell whether the houses are going up or coming down. It\u0027s a silent and desolate place and it seems a sensible place to stop and shelter for a while.\\n\\n The paving slabs and tarmac beneath my feet give way to gravel and dirt. I follow the muddy and uneven route deeper into the centre of the building site and find myself walking along a row of six homes of varying shapes, sizes and degrees of construction. The ground has been so badly churned by machinery here that it takes me a while to realise that I\u0027m actually walking through the future back gardens of these buildings, not across the front. I wonder whether any of these houses will ever be finished now? The three furthest from me appear to be the most complete and I head towards them. Their windows and doors are covered with grey metal grilles. All except the middle one of the three. The grille which covered the space where its back door was intended to go has been prised off. It\u0027s lying on the ground in a puddle of mud, buckled and useless. I\u0027m standing in front of the doorway now looking inside. Has someone been here? I realise that there could still be people inside but I need to stop. Should I go in? Is it safe? Sensing that no-where\u0027s safe anymore I climb the step and cautiously enter the building. If there is anyone in there and they\u0027re not like me I\u0027ll kill them.\\n\\n Footsteps in the darkness. Sudden movement.\\n\\n I try to move back but before I can react a figure is on top of me. My legs are kicked out from under me and I\u0027m sent flying back across the hard concrete floor. I can\u0027t see anything. I try to kick and punch myself free and stand up but before I can move I\u0027m knocked back down again. I can feel someone pressing down on my ankles and someone else has their hands on my shoulders, keeping me flat on the ground. There\u0027s a third person in here. I can see their shadow moving past the doorway.\\n\\n \u0027Think he\u0027s safe?\u0027 someone asks. They switch on a torch and the unexpected brightness burns my eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Turn it off,\u0027 I hear another one of them say in a loud, relieved whisper. \u0027He\u0027s all right.\u0027\\n\\n As quickly as the hands grabbed hold of me they now let go. I shuffle back across the floor, putting as much distance as I can between me and whoever else is in here. The light in the half-finished house is limited and I\u0027m struggling to see anything. Someone\u0027s moving just ahead of me. I know there are at least three people in here but are there any more? The torch is switched on again.\\n\\n \u0027Take it easy, mate,\u0027 one of them says. \u0027We\u0027re not going to hurt you.\u0027\\n\\n I don\u0027t know if I believe him. I don\u0027t know if I believe anyone anymore.\\n\\n The figure holding the torch shines the light into their own face. It\u0027s a man, perhaps mid-to-late twenties. I know instantly that he\u0027s like me and that I\u0027m safe with him. And if this man is no threat then the people who are with him are no threat either.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s your name?\u0027 he asks.\\n\\n \u0027Danny,\u0027 I tell him, \u0027Danny McCoyne.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Been like this for long, love?\u0027 asks a woman\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 I mumble back.\\n\\n \u0027Been long since it happened?\u0027 she asks, rephrasing her question. I assume she\u0027s talking about what happened at home when I killed Harry and lost my family.\\n\\n \u0027Few hours,\u0027 I mumble, my throat dry. \u0027Not sure...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m Patrick,\u0027 the man holding the torch says, holding out his hand. I\u0027m not sure whether he wants me to shake it or whether he\u0027s going to pull me up. I reach out and he helps me to stand. \u0027Happened to me three days ago,\u0027 he continues. \u0027Same for Nancy here. That\u0027s Craig,\u0027 he says, pointing the torch at the third person across the room. \u0027Yesterday afternoon, wasn\u0027t it, Craig?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just after dinner,\u0027 Craig answers. Patrick shines the torch at him but it only illuminates a small part of a huge expanse of belly. Craig is immense.\\n\\n \u0027So what happened?\u0027 Nancy asks. \u0027Anyone close?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My partner\u0027s dad,\u0027 I explain, feeling some sadness but no remorse or guilt over what I\u0027ve done. \u0027He just turned on me. Thought he was going to kill me so I...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Had to get him first?\u0027 she interrupts, finishing my sentence for me. My eyes are getting used to the darkness in the house now. I can see Nancy nodding and I immediately know that she completely understands what I had to do and why I had to do it, even if I\u0027m still not sure myself. \u0027Everything will start to make more sense soon,\u0027 she tells me. \u0027I was just the same when it happened to me. Hated myself for doing it but I didn\u0027t have any choice. I\u0027d been with John for almost thirty years and we\u0027d hardly spent a day apart in all that time. It was just like someone had flicked a switch. I knew I had to do it.\u0027\\n\\n This is in danger of turning into a comedy of errors. Have they all killed? I ask the question without realising I\u0027m speaking out loud.\\n\\n \u0027Suppose it just depends where you are when it happens,\u0027 Patrick says. \u0027Craig hasn\u0027t killed anyone yet, which is a surprise when you look at the size of the bugger!\u0027\\n\\n Nancy takes up Craig\u0027s story.\\n\\n \u0027Tried though, didn\u0027t you, love,\u0027 she sighs. In the circle of torchlight I see him nod. \u0027Bunch of them had you cornered at work, didn\u0027t they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was picking orders in the warehouse with four of them,\u0027 the giant of a man explains in a surprisingly soft voice. \u0027Didn\u0027t know what was happening. I started on one of them but there were too many. They shut me in one of the offices but I managed to get out of a window. All I could do was run.\u0027\\n\\n This conversation is bizarre and uncomfortably surreal. It only becomes believable again when I remember the fact that I\u0027ve killed twice today. How could that be? Christ, until this morning I hadn\u0027t even hit anyone in temper, let alone killed them. Patrick passes me a bottle of water which I drink from thirstily.\\n\\n \u0027What about you?\u0027 I ask him.\\n\\n \u0027I killed,\u0027 he answers. \u0027Don\u0027t know who the guy was, I just had to do it like the rest of you. He was just stood there staring at me as I was getting into the car...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027...and?\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I mowed him down. Started the engine, chased him down the street and I mowed him down. Pretty much wrote the car off too. Just kept driving along with him under the wheels. I didn\u0027t know what else to do. Tried to go back home but when I got there I saw that my girl was just like the rest of them and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027...and you know the rest of the story,\u0027 Craig grumbles. \u0027You just have to do it, don\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It feels like second nature,\u0027 Patrick says quietly. \u0027It\u0027s instinctive. It\u0027s animal instinct.\u0027\\n\\n The room falls silent.\\n\\n \u0027So what happens now?\u0027 I ask.\\n\\n \u0027Who knows,\u0027 Nancy answers. \u0027My guess is we\u0027ll just keep killing each other until either we\u0027re all gone or they are. Crazy, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n It\u0027s hard to get my head round the fact that this woman (who looks like any other average wife / mother / daughter / sister / aunt) is talking so matter-of-factly about killing. In the days since she\u0027s changed she seems to have relinquished every aspect of her former life and is now prepared to kill to stay alive herself. At moments like this it all seems beyond belief. Nancy looks more likely to bake you a cake than kill you. I shake my head in bewilderment as Craig gets up and drags a wooden board across the open doorway, blocking out the last shards of light coming in from outside. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-35.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
