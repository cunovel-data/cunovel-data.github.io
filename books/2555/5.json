{"id":111953,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"We\u0027re out. We\u0027ve escaped. For the first time in months Lizzie and I have managed to get away from the house together without any of the children in tow. I can\u0027t remember the last time we were out together like this. The fact that we\u0027re crammed into a small, dark and sweaty concert hall with six or seven hundred other people doesn\u0027t seem to matter. The gig hasn\u0027t even started yet but the background music is already deafening and the lighting is virtually non-existent. The chances of us actually managing to speak to each other are slim. \u0027Doesn\u0027t feel right, does it?\u0027 Liz shouts at me. She has to lift herself up onto tiptoes to yell into my ear. \u0027What doesn\u0027t?\u0027 I shout back. \u0027Not having the kids here. I\u0027m not used to it. I keep looking round expecting to see at least one of them.\u0027 \u0027Make the most of it,\u0027 I tell her. \u0027How long\u0027s it been since we went out together on our own?\u0027 \u0027Months,\u0027 she screams, struggling to make herself heard over the noise. The conversation is over quickly. The effort of having to yell at each other is already making my throat sore and the gig hasn\u0027t even started yet. I watch the stage as roadies and other crew members check the lights, the sound and the instruments. How long does it take them to get ready? They seem to have been setting things up for ages, there can\u0027t be long left to wait now. Someone\u0027s going round putting towels and drinks down and gaffer-taping set lists to the floor. Christ, what was that? Something hit me from the side and I\u0027m down on the floor before I know what\u0027s happened. I try to stand up quickly, my heart thumping in my chest. Liz grabs my arm and pulls me to my feet. I don\u0027t want any trouble tonight. I\u0027m not good at dealing with confrontation. I really don\u0027t want any trouble. \u0027Sorry, mate,\u0027 an over-excited and half-drunk fan shouts at me. He\u0027s holding two (now) half-empty drinks in his hands and I can tell from his blurred and directionless eyes that he\u0027s off his face on drugs or booze or both. We\u0027re standing close to the mixing desk and there\u0027s a carpet-covered bump running along the floor next to us which protects the power cables I think. Looks like this idiot has tripped up the step and gone flying. He mumbles something about being sorry again and then staggers off deeper into the crowd. \u0027You all right?\u0027 Liz asks, wiping splashes of drink from my shirt. \u0027Fine,\u0027 I answer quickly. My heart\u0027s still beating at ten times its normal speed. Relieved, I pull Lizzie towards me and wrap my arms around her. Having her next to me makes me feel safe. It\u0027s not often we\u0027re able to be this close anymore. That\u0027s the price you pay for having too many kids too quickly in a flat that\u0027s too small. Funny how we can stand in a room with the best part of a thousand strangers and have less chance of being interrupted than at home with just three children. Lizzie turns round and lifts herself up onto tiptoes to speak to me again. \u0027Think Dad\u0027s okay?\u0027 she asks. \u0027Why shouldn\u0027t he be?\u0027 I yell back. \u0027I worry that he thinks we\u0027re taking advantage of him. He\u0027s already there looking after Josh most days now and he\u0027s there again tonight with all three of them. It\u0027s a lot to ask. He\u0027s not getting any younger and I think he\u0027s starting to get fed up of it.\u0027 \u0027I know he is. He had a go at me before we left.\u0027 \u0027What did he say?\u0027 How much do I tell her? Harry and I don\u0027t get on but we try and stay civil for Lizzie\u0027s sake. He was not at all happy tonight but I know he wouldn\u0027t want Lizzie to worry about it. \u0027Nothing much,\u0027 I answer, shrugging my shoulders, \u0027he just grumbled something about him seeing more of the kids than I do. He made some bad joke about Josh calling him Daddy instead of me.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s trying to wind you up. Just ignore him.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s always trying to wind me up.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s just his age.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a crap excuse.\u0027 \u0027Just ignore him,\u0027 she says again. \u0027It doesn\u0027t bother me,\u0027 I shout, lying and trying to save her feelings. The truth is Harry is seriously beginning to piss me off and it\u0027s getting to the point where I can see us coming to blows. \u0027So what did you say to him?\u0027 \u0027I just told him how we appreciate what he does for us and reminded him that it\u0027s been at least four months since you and I last went out together on our own.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s just trying to get you to react...\u0027 she starts to say. She stops speaking and turns around quickly when the lights suddenly fade. The crowd erupts into life as the members of the band walk through the shadows and step out onto the stage. After a few seconds delay the music starts and I forget about Harry and everything else. This is the fourth time I\u0027ve seen The Men They Couldn\u0027t Hang. It\u0027s been a couple of years since I last saw them and it\u0027s great to see them again. I\u0027ve been looking forward to tonight since I booked the tickets a couple of months ago. I never get enough of the adrenaline rush of hearing good music played live and played loud like this. Hearing these songs again snatches me out of the day to day and helps me forget all the things I usually waste my time worrying about. I hold Lizzie close. As long as the music\u0027s playing I don\u0027t have to do anything except listen, relax and enjoy myself. Six or seven songs in now - not sure exactly how many - and this place is really alive. The hall is packed and there\u0027s a brilliant atmosphere here. Swill plays the opening notes to one of my favourite tracks and I recognise it instantly, way ahead of most of the crowd. I feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end and I squeeze Lizzie tighter. She knows just how much I love this. They\u0027ve really hit their stride now and it\u0027s like they\u0027ve never been away. Hearing this music again brings back so many memories. I remember the first time I heard this song on the radio just after I passed my driving test. I\u0027d just brought my first car. It was an old heap that cost more to insure than it did to buy and me and a few mates had gone down to... Swill has stopped playing. Strange. He was strumming his guitar and singing but he\u0027s just stopped. The rest of the band have carried on without him. It\u0027s like he\u0027s forgotten where he is and what he\u0027s supposed to be doing. He\u0027s let go of his guitar and it\u0027s hanging by the strap around his neck now, swinging from side to side. This guy has just spent the last forty minutes playing and singing his heart out but now he\u0027s just standing completely still centre stage, head bowed and staring at the microphone in front of him. Has he forgotten the words? Bloody hell, he\u0027s been doing this for long enough. Surely it can\u0027t be stage fright or anything like that? Is there a technical problem? Maybe he\u0027s ill? The rest of the music continues for a few bars longer. One by one the rest of the band realise that something\u0027s wrong. The lead guitarist has stopped now, and he\u0027s staring at Swill trying to work out what the hell\u0027s going on. McGuire, the bass player, comes to a faltering stop just leaving the drummer to pound out a few more empty and unaccompanied beats before he stops too. Now Lizzie, me, the rest of the band and the entire audience are staring at the slowly swaying figure of Swill standing awkwardly in the spotlight. The crowd doesn\u0027t like it. For a few seconds there\u0027s been an uneasy quiet but now the audience is beginning to turn. People are shouting out insults and there\u0027s a slow handclap starting. I\u0027ve got no idea what\u0027s wrong. It makes me feel nervous. Just wish something would happen... I think he\u0027s about to walk off. Swill takes a couple of steps back and then stops. Now he\u0027s taken hold of his guitar and he\u0027s swung it round his head so that it\u0027s no longer hanging round his neck. He\u0027s standing still again now, looking around the stage, oblivious to the jeers and shouts from the hundreds of people who are staring at him and yelling at him to get on with it and start playing. Cush starts to approach him and now Swill moves. He suddenly bursts into life and moves quickly and unexpectedly to his left. Holding the guitar by its neck he swings it around again, now gripping it like a weapon. He lunges towards Simmonds, the lead guitarist, and swings the instrument round once more, catching him full on the side of this head. Simmonds tried to lift his hand to block the blow but the attack was so quick and unexpected that he wasn\u0027t able to properly defend himself. The force of the impact has sent him reeling back into the drum kit, clutching his jaw. But that\u0027s not the end of it. Swill is standing over him now and he\u0027s started smashing the guitar down on him again and again. Bloody hell, he\u0027s hitting him so hard that the wooden instrument has begun to splinter and smash. I don\u0027t understand. Maybe they had an argument before they came on stage or something like that? This guy has always made a big deal out of the fact that he\u0027s a pacifist. Now look at him! What the hell did Simmonds do to deserve this? McGuire is trying to separate them now... The audience is starting to turn nasty. We\u0027ve stood together and watched in disbelief but now people are starting to react to what they\u0027re seeing. Many of the people right down at the front are trying to push their way out, a small minority are cheering on the violence and are trying to get closer chanting \u0027Swill, Swill...\u0027 and egging him on. Most of us are just stood staring at the stage. I look up again and I can hardly believe what I\u0027m seeing. Swill is standing centre-stage again now, swinging a metal microphone stand around in a wide arc. Simmonds is flat on his back in what\u0027s left of the drum kit and he\u0027s not moving. McGuire\u0027s crawling across the stage on his hands and knees, trying to get to him. Now two roadies have rushed Swill. One of them catches the full force of a swipe with the mike stand right across his chest, the other dives and wraps himself around the musician\u0027s waist and tries to grapple him down. He\u0027s having none of it. He kicks and punches him off and tries to scramble away. He trips over the monitors and disappears down into the dark pit between the stage and the security barriers. There\u0027s a wail of feedback that sounds like a scream. Lost him. Can\u0027t see him. Suddenly he appears again. He\u0027s pushed his way out through the barriers and is running into the crowd. His MAG T-shirt is ripped and now hangs round his neck like a rag. The audience react with a strange mixture of fear and adulation. Some people run away from him, others run towards him. \u0027Let\u0027s go,\u0027 Lizzie shouts to me. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027I want to go,\u0027 she says again. \u0027Now, Danny, please. I want to go.\u0027 People are starting to try and move away from the stage area in large numbers. The house lights come up and everyone\u0027s speed suddenly seems to increase now that they can see where they\u0027re going. We\u0027re pushed and jostled towards the exits by shocked and frightened people criss-crossing in every direction, trying to get away from the trouble before it gets any worse. In the middle of the hall the fighting starts to look like a fully-fledged riot. I can\u0027t see what\u0027s happened to Swill but scores of fans who are either pissed or stoned or who just enjoy a good fight have dived into the middle of the chaos with their fists-flying. There\u0027s already a bottleneck forming where the bulk of the crowd is struggling to get out of the venue. I grab Lizzie\u0027s hand and pull her towards the nearest exit. We\u0027re surrounded by people and our speed reduces to a painfully-slow shuffle. A mass of huge, shaven-headed security guards push their way into the hall through another door to our left. I\u0027m not sure whether they\u0027re here to try and stop the fighting or just to join in. I don\u0027t want to wait around to find out. Through the double-doors, down a short, steep, stone staircase and we finally push our way out onto the street. It\u0027s pouring with rain and there are people everywhere running in all directions. I have no idea what just happened in there. \u0027You okay?\u0027 I ask Lizzie. She nods. She looks shocked and scared. \u0027I\u0027m all right,\u0027 she answers. \u0027I just want to go home.\u0027 I grab her hand tighter still and pull her through the bemused crowds. Some people are hanging around the front of the venue but most seem to be leaving. I\u0027m really fucking angry but I\u0027m trying not to show it. That\u0027s just typical of how things seem to be working out for me at the moment. Why does everything have to be so difficult? I just wanted to relax and switch off and enjoy myself for once, but what happens? A long-time musical hero loses all his credibility and fucks up my first night out with Liz in months. Fucking typical. Bloody primadonna. We slip down a side street and run back to the car.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-5.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
