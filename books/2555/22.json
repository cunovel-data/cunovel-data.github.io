I need to get the food inside then shut the door and lock the bloody thing behind me and never open it again. \u0027Are you all right?\u0027 she asks again. \u0027Why were you so long?\u0027 I run back to the car and grab the last few odds and ends that have fallen out of the rapidly disintegrating cardboard box. I push past her and throw the stuff into the kitchen. \u0027Dad,\u0027 Ed whines, \u0027can we have something to eat now? I\u0027m starving...\u0027 I ignore all of them and concentrate on locking the door and making sure my home and my family are secure. \u0027Move,\u0027 I grunt angrily at Ellis who is standing right in the middle of the hallway, stopping me from getting through. \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 Lizzie asks again from the other side of the kitchen table. When I don\u0027t answer she starts to unpack some of the food. She looks at what I\u0027ve brought home and screws up her face. \u0027What did you get this for?\u0027 she says, holding up a jar of honey. \u0027None of us likes honey.\u0027 All of the tension and fear that\u0027s been building up inside me this morning suddenly comes rushing to the surface. It\u0027s no-one\u0027s fault, I just can\u0027t help myself. \u0027I know no-one likes it,\u0027 I shout, \u0027no-one likes any of this fucking stuff but it\u0027s all I could get. You should go out there and see what it\u0027s like. It\u0027s madness out there. The whole bloody world is falling apart so don\u0027t start having a go at me and telling me that no-one fucking well likes honey.\u0027 Liz looks like I\u0027ve punched her in the face. She\u0027s gone white with shock. The kids are all in the kitchen with us now, staring at us both with wide, frightened eyes. \u0027I just...\u0027 she starts to say. \u0027I\u0027m doing the best I can for us here,\u0027 I scream at her. \u0027There are people fighting on the streets. I\u0027ve just watched a kid beating some woman to death and no-one lifted a finger to help her, me included. It\u0027s fucking madness and I don\u0027t know what to do anymore. The last thing I need is for you to start complaining and picking holes in what I\u0027ve done when I feel like I\u0027ve just risked my damn neck for you lot. I don\u0027t ask much, just some space and a little gratitude and understanding and...\u0027 I stop shouting. Liz is trembling. She\u0027s standing there, back pressed against the cooker, and she\u0027s shaking with fear. What the hell is wrong with her? I take a single step around the table to get closer to her and she recoils. She slides further away from me, edging back towards the door. And then I realise what\u0027s wrong. Jesus, she thinks I\u0027ve changed. She thinks I\u0027m one of them. She thinks I\u0027m a Hater. \u0027No, don\u0027t...\u0027 I start to say, trying to move closer again, \u0027Please, Lizzie...\u0027 She\u0027s starting to sob. Her legs look like they\u0027re about to give way. Don\u0027t collapse on me, Liz, please don\u0027t... \u0027Stay back,\u0027 she says, her voice barely audible. \u0027Don\u0027t come any closer.\u0027 I try to speak but I can\u0027t get the words out. Don\u0027t do this to me. I shuffle nearer. \u0027Stay back!\u0027 she screams again, sliding further along the wall away from me. She reaches the door and starts to push the kids out of the kitchen. She doesn\u0027t take her eyes off me. \u0027No, Liz,\u0027 I say, desperate to make her understand, \u0027please. I haven\u0027t changed. Please believe me. I\u0027m sorry I shouted. I didn\u0027t mean to...\u0027 She stops moving away but she\u0027s still unsure. I can see it in her eyes. \u0027If you\u0027re one of them I\u0027ll...\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not, Lizzie, I\u0027m not. If I was one of them I\u0027d have gone for you by now, wouldn\u0027t I?\u0027 I cry. I don\u0027t know what else to say. I\u0027m starting to panic but I don\u0027t want her to see. \u0027Please, I\u0027m not sick. I\u0027m not like them. I\u0027m calm. I was angry but I\u0027m calm now, aren\u0027t I? Please...\u0027 I can see that she\u0027s thinking hard about what I\u0027ve just said. The children are peering around the door, trying to see what\u0027s happening. Inside I\u0027m screaming but I force myself to stay level and not shout. My head is filled with all kinds of dark, terrifying thoughts. I just got angry, that\u0027s all. I\u0027m not a Hater, am I? \u0027Okay,\u0027 she eventually mumbles, \u0027but if you shout at me like that again I\u0027ll...\u0027 \u0027I won\u0027t,\u0027 I interrupt. \u0027I forgot myself. I didn\u0027t think.\u0027 I still don\u0027t know if she believes me. She\u0027s looking at me out of the corner of her eye and it\u0027s like she\u0027s waiting for me to attack her. I\u0027d never hurt her. I\u0027m relieved when she moves back round to the box of food and continues unpacking it. Every couple of seconds she looks up. Every time I move I see her catch her breath and stop. \u0027So what happened out there?\u0027 she asks, finally composed enough to be able to talk to me again. I don\u0027t know where to start. Between us we try and feed the kids while I explain about the queues at the supermarket and what I saw at O\u0027Shea\u0027s. I tell her about the looting and about the girl attacking the woman and... and I realise again just how bad things have suddenly got. Ellis is snapping at my heels. She\u0027s oblivious to the fact that anything\u0027s wrong. That\u0027s good, I decide. I\u0027m glad. Now that she has her food she\u0027s nagging at me to let her watch a DVD. I follow her into the living room. She fetches the film she wants from the cupboard and brings it over. I switch on the TV but stop before I put the DVD in the machine. \u0027I turned that off about an hour ago,\u0027 Liz says. \u0027Couldn\u0027t stand watching any more of it. They keep showing the same thing again and again and again.\u0027 I sit cross-legged in front of the television and stare at the pictures that flash in front of me. Christ, things are really bad. I\u0027ve seen a lot of bizarre stuff over the last few days but what I\u0027m watching now scares the hell out of me. Now I fully realise how dire and serious the situation has quickly become. The news has gone. There are no more reports and no more presenters. All we\u0027re left with is a continually repeated public information film. My stomach is churning with nerves again. \u0027Stay in your homes,\u0027 a deep and reassuring male voice announces over stock footage and a series of simplistic graphic images, back at the beginning of the loop again. \u0027Stay with your family. Stay away from people you don\u0027t know...\u0027 I look up at Lizzie and she looks back at me and shrugs her shoulders. \u0027It\u0027s all just common-sense stuff. Nothing we haven\u0027t already heard.\u0027 \u0027Stay calm and don\u0027t panic.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 I protest. \u0027Stay calm and don\u0027t panic? Bloody hell, have they seen what\u0027s happening out there?\u0027 \u0027It gets better,\u0027 she says sarcastically. \u0027Listen to the next bit.\u0027 \u0027The authorities are working to bring the situation under control. Your assistance and cooperation is required to make sure this happens quickly and with as little disturbance as possible. Temporary controls and regulations are necessary to make this happen. Firstly, if you have to leave your home, you must carry some form of identification with you at all times. Secondly, with immediate effect an ongoing night-time curfew is in place. You may not travel between dusk and dawn. Anyone found on the streets after dark will be dealt with appropriately...\u0027 Dealt with appropriately? Christ, what\u0027s that supposed to mean? Are they going to start locking people up for being out at night? \u0027Ensure that your home is secure. Prepare a safe room for you and your family to stay in. Ensure that the door to the safe room and all other access points can be secured and locked from the inside.\u0027 \u0027What the hell is this?\u0027 I say under my breath. \u0027Can you put my film on now please, Daddy?\u0027 Ellis moans impatiently. \u0027If any of the people you are with should begin to act aggressively or out of character, you must isolate yourselves from them immediately. Lock yourself and the rest of the people with you in your safe room. Remove the affected person from your property if it is safe to do so without putting yourself at risk. Remember that this person may well be a family member, a loved one or a close friend. They will be unable to control their actions and emotions. They will be violent and will show no remorse or understanding. It is vital that you protect yourself and those remaining with you.\u0027 \u0027Can you see why I turned it off? Lizzie asks. \u0027This kind of thing is just making it worse.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t believe this...\u0027 I stammer, lost for words. \u0027I just can\u0027t believe this...\u0027 \u0027Think they know what\u0027s going on now?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure they do,\u0027 I answer. \u0027They must have worked it out if they\u0027re showing something like this. Someone must know what\u0027s happening, and that makes things even worse, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Does it? Why?\u0027 I shrug my shoulders. \u0027Because things must be pretty well fucked if they\u0027re still not telling us anything. It sounds to me like they\u0027re trying to lock everybody down just to try and keep things under control, and what I\u0027ve seen this morning makes me think that maybe things aren\u0027t under control right now.\u0027 Lizzie frowns at me for swearing in front of Ellis. I turn back to the screen. \u0027...first indication will be a sudden fit of rage and anger,\u0027 the disturbingly unemotional voice on the TV continues. \u0027This rage will typically be directed at one person in particular. Remember that those affected may appear calm again once the initial outburst of anger and violence has passed. Continue to keep your distance. Regardless of who they are or what they say, these people are not in control of their actions. They will continue to pose a threat to you and your family...\u0027 Lizzie strides past me and snatches Ellis\u0027 DVD from my hands. She shoves it into the machine and it starts to play. \u0027That\u0027s enough,\u0027 she snaps. \u0027I was watching that...\u0027 \u0027Will you go and get Dad?\u0027 My heart sinks. I don\u0027t want to leave the flat again but I know I don\u0027t have any choice. \u0027When do you want me to...?\u0027 I begin before she interrupts. \u0027Get him now,\u0027 she answers, nervously chewing her fingernails. \u0027If you won\u0027t go and get him I will.\u0027 The thought of Lizzie being alone out there is worse than the thought of going out myself. I have to do it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-22.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults. Christened “Haters” by the media, the attackers strike without warning and seemingly without reason. Within seconds, normally rational, self-controlled people become frenzied, vicious killers. As the carnage mounts, one thing soon is clear: everyone, irrespective of race, gender, age, or class, has the potential to become either a Hater or a victim. At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent. In the face of this mindless terror, all McCoyne can do is secure his family, seek shelter, and watch as the world falls apart. But when he bolts the front door, the question remains: Is he shutting the danger out or locking it in?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/hater-hater-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:58 AM"}}
