{"id":111984,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"We\u0027ve been driving for what feels like hours but I know it hasn\u0027t been anywhere near that long. We paused another five (might have been six) times to pick up more people but it\u0027s been a while since we last stopped. There are now twenty-eight of us in here I think. It\u0027s a relief to be with so many people like me but space is limited and it\u0027s hot and bloody uncomfortable in here. I assume the truck is full now, so where the hell are they taking us? My home and family and everything else that\u0027s gone seems a million miles away. I know that the distance between me and Ellis is increasing with every minute I spend trapped in this bloody truck. The tarpaulin cover over our heads blocks out most of the light so it\u0027s difficult to see much in here. I\u0027ve managed to drag myself over to one side of the vehicle and someone nearby has been able to lift up a small flap of material. I can\u0027t see very much through the gap, just the edge of the road rushing by. We\u0027ve not slowed to take any turnings for some time. We must be on a major road and it must be virtually empty. I\u0027m practically blind and I can\u0027t hear anything over the clattering engine of the truck and the rumble of the wheels on the tarmac. The world feels alien and desolate and the disorientation of the journey makes it a hundred times worse. The few faces I can make out nearest to me appear beaten, empty and expressionless. No-one understands what\u0027s happened to them or why. People are too frightened and confused to talk and so remain silent and subdued. There\u0027s no conversation, just the odd whispered word. I wish there was some distraction. Without anything else to occupy my mind all I can do is remember Ellis and also think about what might be waiting for me at the end of this journey. Where are we being taken, and what\u0027s going to happen when we get there? Someone near the back makes a half-hearted attempt to open the back of the truck. For a few seconds an escape seems possible until we find that the tarpaulin has been secured from outside. We\u0027re trapped in here. There\u0027s a girl sitting next to me who is gradually becoming more and more agitated. I\u0027ve consciously tried not to stare at anyone in the semi-darkness but I\u0027ve seen enough to know that she\u0027s young and pretty although her face is tired and grubby and is streaked with tears. She\u0027s in her late teens I think, maybe older. She\u0027s leaning against me and I can feel her body shaking. She\u0027s been sobbing for some time. Christ, I\u0027m scared, how the hell must she be feeling? She looks up at me and makes eye contact for the first time. \u0027I feel sick,\u0027 she whimpers. \u0027I think I\u0027m going to be ill.\u0027 I\u0027m no good at dealing with vomit. Please don\u0027t throw up, I think to myself. \u0027Take deep breaths,\u0027 I suggest, \u0027it\u0027s probably just nerves. Try and take some deep breaths.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not nerves,\u0027 she says, \u0027I get travel sick.\u0027 Great. Without thinking I hold her arm and start to rub her back with my other hand. It\u0027s more of a comfort for me than anything else. \u0027What\u0027s your name?\u0027 I ask, hoping that I might be able to distract her and take her mind off how ill she\u0027s feeling. \u0027Karin,\u0027 she replies. And now I\u0027m stuck for something to say. What can I talk to her about? If she\u0027s anything like me she\u0027ll have found she\u0027s suddenly become a homeless, family and friend-less killer. There\u0027s no point trying to make small talk. Bloody idiot, I wish I hadn\u0027t said anything. \u0027Do you think we\u0027re going to be in here much longer,\u0027 she asks, her breathing suddenly shallow. \u0027No idea,\u0027 I answer truthfully. \u0027Where are they taking us?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know. Look, the best thing you can do is try and take your mind off it. Just find something else to concentrate on and...\u0027 It\u0027s too late, she\u0027s beginning to heave. She grabs my hand as she starts to convulse. I try and turn her around so she can be sick out through the small gap in the tarpaulin but there\u0027s not enough space and not enough time. She throws up, splattering the inside of the truck and my boots and trousers with puke. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 she moans as the smell hits me. I\u0027m struggling to control my own stomach now. I can taste bile in the back of my throat and I can hear other people gagging and groaning in disgust all around me. \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 I mumble. The inside of the truck, which was already hot and musty because of the sheer number of people trapped inside it, now stinks. It\u0027s impossible to escape the smell but I have to try and do something otherwise I\u0027ll shortly be adding to the stench myself. I stand up, holding onto the side of the truck for support and, now that I\u0027m upright, I notice a small rip in the tarpaulin at my eye-level. I look closer and see that it\u0027s a seam which has begun to come undone. I push my fingers into the gap and try to open out my hand. As I stretch my fingers the stitching holding the material together frays and comes apart. Finally some welcome daylight and much needed cool, fresh air is able to flood into the truck. Not giving a damn about the consequences I shove both hands into the rip and pull as hard as I can in either direction. The gap increases in size to about half a metre and I can hear the relief of the people around me. \u0027Can you see where we are?\u0027 a voice asks from somewhere on the other side of the truck. All I can see are trees at the side of the road as we rush past. \u0027Haven\u0027t got a clue,\u0027 I answer. \u0027Can\u0027t see much.\u0027 \u0027You can see more than me,\u0027 the voice snaps, \u0027keep looking.\u0027 I push my head right out through the canopy and try to look up towards the front of the truck. We\u0027re on a motorway, I think. The long and relatively featureless road gradually curves away to the left and, for the first time, I see that we\u0027re not travelling alone. There\u0027s another truck in front. Hold on, there\u0027s more than one. It\u0027s difficult to be sure, but I think I can see at least another five vehicles ahead of us, all trucks of a similar size to this one, equally spaced from each other. Taking care not to slip in the gross puddle at my feet I shuffle around so that I can look behind us. I count at least as many trucks again following, probably more. \u0027Well?\u0027 the voice asks as I pull my head back inside. \u0027Can\u0027t see where we are,\u0027 I reply, loud enough for everyone to hear, \u0027but we\u0027re not on our own.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027There are loads of trucks like this,\u0027 I tell them, \u0027at least ten that I can see.\u0027 \u0027So where are they taking us?\u0027 another frightened voice asks, not really expecting an answer. \u0027What are they going to do with us?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I hear Patrick reply in his familiar resigned tone, \u0027but you can bet it\u0027s going to be fucking awful, whatever it is.\u0027 I stick my head back out of the side of the truck again to escape the stink of vomit and the nervous, frightened conversations which Patrick\u0027s accurate but insensitive comments have just started.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-39.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
