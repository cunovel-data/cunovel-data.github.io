{"id":111976,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"I hear movement inside the flat, away from the safe room. Don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ve been lying here on my own. Must have fallen asleep. I feel sick. I need to get a drink. I sit up, swing my legs out over the side of the bunk and climb down. My body aches as I stretch and stumble down the hallway. Someone\u0027s in the kitchen. I move closer and see through the open door that it\u0027s Harry. He\u0027s standing at the sink with his back to me, making a drink or washing up or something. I take a step through the door and into the room with him and then stop. Don\u0027t know why. Something\u0027s not right. I don\u0027t want to go any closer. I can taste something in the air and it makes me feel uneasy. No, it\u0027s more than that, it makes me feel unsafe. Harry stops what he\u0027s doing. Does he know I\u0027m here? For what feels like forever neither of us moves. Then he slowly turns around. Is he...? Jesus Christ. I stare deep into the old man\u0027s eyes and I am frozen to the spot with fear. Can this be the same man? He glares back at me with cold, steely eyes filled with an inexplicable hate and disgust. I can sense his revulsion of me coming off him like a stench and I know that for some inexplicable but undeniable reason he wants me dead. He wants to destroy me. My legs become weak with nerves as I realise that the hate has finally arrived in my home. Harry moves suddenly and I react at speed. He takes just a single step forward but it\u0027s enough and I know that my life is in danger unless I act now. An overwhelming instinctive desire for self-preservation takes over as I move away from him. I look over to my right. On the worktop is our wooden knife-block. I grab the black-handled bread knife and pull it from the block like I\u0027m unsheathing a sword. In a single movement I charge towards Harry and plunge it deep into his flesh, just above his waist. I put my other arm around him and pull him closer to me, forcing the blade deeper and deeper into his gut, twisting it round as I push it forward. I feel its serrated edge slice through his skin and cut through muscles, veins and arteries and I shove it deeper into him until the entire length of the knife has disappeared. I feel a sudden flow of hot blood as it gushes out over my hand and I let go of the knife and push Harry away. He trips back. His legs buckle beneath him and he collapses to the floor, smacking the back of his head against the oven door as he falls. I stand over him. He\u0027s still breathing but he won\u0027t last long now. I have to be sure that he\u0027s dead. There\u0027s a scream from the doorway - a shrill, ear-piercing yell - and I turn around and see Lizzie and the children. She looks at me with the same cold expression as her father and I sense the hate again. I pull the knife out from the dying man\u0027s gut and lunge towards her, knowing that she has to die too. She backs away, dragging the children out of the room with her. Edward and Josh stare angrily at me with as much hate as their mother. \u0027Daddy!\u0027 Ellis screams. I look deep into my little girl\u0027s face and I know instantly that she\u0027s not like the others. She\u0027s like me. She hasn\u0027t changed. I run around the edge of the kitchen table and reach out for her but I\u0027m too late. Her mother has already grabbed her by the scruff of her neck and has pulled her out of reach. Her tiny, tear-streaked face is filled with fear and shock and her eyes bulge wide as Liz yanks on her clothing, hauling her away from me. Ed glares at me. Even Josh despises me. My sons despise me and I know that I have to destroy them too. I hurl myself towards Lizzie again, knowing that I have to kill her before she can hurt me and before she can harm Ellis. She shouts at the children to move and they run down the hallway towards the living room. Edward pulls Josh\u0027s pushchair across the hall and I trip over it, ending up on my hands and knees. Before I can get up and get to the living room they slam the door shut. I hear the bolt click across. What the hell do I do now? How did this happen? How could my family turn against me so quickly? I have to forget about them and get to Ellis. She hasn\u0027t changed and I know that she needs me. I pick myself up and run at the door. I smash my shoulder into it but it doesn\u0027t move. I run back and charge it again and again and, the fifth time I hit it, I feel the bolt give way. I try to force the door open but it only moves a couple of inches. They\u0027ve pushed furniture against it to stop me from getting inside. Why are they doing this to me? I hammer my fists against the door. \u0027Ellis,\u0027 I shout. \u0027Ellis!\u0027 I can hear her. She\u0027s trapped in there. I can hear her screaming back at me. She\u0027s like me, not them, and she needs to be with me. She\u0027s not safe in there. I\u0027m desperate. I can\u0027t leave her. I throw myself at the door again and the force of the impact shakes my whole body to the core. \u0027Ellis!\u0027 I yell again. I can still just about hear her muffled reply. There has to be another way to get to her. The window. I\u0027ll get in through the living room window. I turn and run back down the hallway, past the body in the kitchen and out into the lobby. I push the front door open and burst out into the cold, rain-soaked world outside. Now that I\u0027m out in the open I\u0027m aware of noise all around me. I can hear the helicopters, the military trucks, gunshots and the sounds of people like me fighting to survive. It\u0027s like being in the middle of a war-zone. But this isn\u0027t the noise of one war being fought, it\u0027s hundreds of separate clashes. Hundreds, probably thousands of battles fought by people like me who\u0027ve been turned on and betrayed. I\u0027m at the living room window. I look inside. Lizzie is still piling furniture against the door. Edward spots me almost immediately and Lizzie shoves the children into the corner of the room. Ellis is trapped behind Edward and Josh but I can still see her. I can still see her face. She\u0027s crying and mouthing my name. I look around for something to use to smash the glass. There\u0027s a broken paving slab halfway down the path to the front door. I pick it up and manage to throw it through the window. The glass shatters and the noise is uncomfortably loud. I can hear their voices again now. I can hear Lizzie screaming at them to keep back and keep away from me. I drag myself up and climb through the window frame, feeling shards of glass digging into me and slicing my skin. The pain doesn\u0027t matter. I force my body through the window head first and collapse onto the carpet. I quickly get up but my footing is unsteady and I\u0027m off-balance. Lizzie is running towards me. She has something in her hands - it\u0027s the metal tube from the vacuum cleaner. She swings it at me. I try to duck out of the way but I\u0027m too slow and she hits me. A sudden burning, searing pain across my face. Blood pouring from my nose and into my mouth. Face down on the carpet. I can\u0027t...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-31.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
