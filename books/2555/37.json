In the morning, I decide, I\u0027ll carry on towards Liz\u0027s sister\u0027s house and look for her there. I just pray that nothing happens before I reach her.\\n\\n In the morning I might risk taking a car for speed. I feel strong and calm and I\u0027m prepared to walk the rest of the way but I\u0027ll be quicker driving, albeit much more exposed and vulnerable. It doesn\u0027t seem to matter now. What I\u0027m doing feels so right. The life I\u0027ve left behind seems more alien and unnatural with each passing minute. I wouldn\u0027t go back to it now, even if I had the choice. I just wish that Lizzie, Edward and Josh could be like Ellis and me.\\n\\n There\u0027s more noise outside. It\u0027s early in the morning - two or three o\u0027clock I think - and there\u0027s a constant stream of sound coming from the middle of town. I can hear more trucks and helicopters. More patrols flushing people out. Whatever happens tomorrow I know I\u0027ll have to leave here. I don\u0027t want to stay in one place for too long. I\u0027ll keep moving until I find Ellis and then, when I\u0027ve got her back, we\u0027ll run together. We\u0027ll find somewhere safe where there are more people like us, well away from those that hate us. And if we can\u0027t find anywhere safe then we\u0027ll kill and destroy as many of them as we have to. It\u0027s like the man said, we have to kill them before they kill us.\\n\\n I\u0027ll sleep now and make my move at first light. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-37.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults. Christened “Haters” by the media, the attackers strike without warning and seemingly without reason. Within seconds, normally rational, self-controlled people become frenzied, vicious killers. As the carnage mounts, one thing soon is clear: everyone, irrespective of race, gender, age, or class, has the potential to become either a Hater or a victim. At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent. In the face of this mindless terror, all McCoyne can do is secure his family, seek shelter, and watch as the world falls apart. But when he bolts the front door, the question remains: Is he shutting the danger out or locking it in?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/hater-hater-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:58 AM"}}
