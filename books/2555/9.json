{"id":111956,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Another bloody wasted day.\\n\\n Today started slowly. I got out of bed late (which really annoyed Lizzie - she had to get up and see to the kids for once) and I made a conscious effort to do as little as possible. I\u0027m back at work tomorrow and I need to relax. I tried hard to do nothing but it\u0027s impossible in this house. There\u0027s always something to do or someone who needs you. Liz has been nagging at me for weeks to fix the bolt on the bathroom door and, today, I finally did it. It was the last thing I wanted to do but I reached the point where I couldn\u0027t stand her complaining about it every single time she used the damn toilet. Christ, the rest of us managed without any problems. Why was it such a big deal for her?\\n\\n I worked on the door as Lizzie cooked dinner. What should have been a ten minute job ended up taking over an hour and a half. I had the kids running round my feet the whole time asking questions and getting in the way, then I didn\u0027t have the right size bolt, then I bought one that was too big... I lost my temper and almost kicked the door in but I finally fixed it. Hope Lizzie\u0027s satisfied. She\u0027ll have to find something else to complain about now.\\n\\n And now here we are approaching Harry\u0027s house and the weekend\u0027s almost over. I genuinely don\u0027t mind Harry but he seems to have a huge problem with me. He doesn\u0027t think I\u0027m good enough for his little girl and although he never says it as blatantly as that it\u0027s implied in just about everything he says to me. I can usually just shrug it off but when the day has been as frustrating as today and Monday morning is looming on the horizon it\u0027s something I could well do without.\\n\\n We pull up outside his narrow terraced house and the kids start to get wound up and excited. They enjoy their time with Grandpa. Truth is they tolerate their time with Harry. They put up with it because they know they\u0027ll get sweets or some other treat out of him before they go home.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want any arguing today,\u0027 Liz says as we wait for him to answer the front door. I think she\u0027s talking to the kids but I realise she\u0027s looking at me.\\n\\n \u0027I never argue with your dad,\u0027 I tell her. \u0027He argues with me. There\u0027s a difference you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not interested,\u0027 she says as the latch clicks open. \u0027Just be nice.\u0027\\n\\n The door opens inwards. Harry opens his arms to the kids and they run towards him, giving him a dutiful squeeze before disappearing deeper inside to trash his house.\\n\\n \u0027Hello, love,\u0027 he says to Lizzie as she hugs him.\\n\\n \u0027You okay, Dad?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 he smiles. \u0027Better now. I\u0027ve been looking forward to seeing you lot all day.\u0027\\n\\n Lizzie follows the children into the house. I go inside, wipe my feet and shut the door behind me.\\n\\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 I say, acknowledging him. I don\u0027t mean to sound abrupt but I unintentionally do.\\n\\n \u0027Daniel,\u0027 he replies, equally abruptly. He turns and walks towards the kitchen. \u0027I\u0027ll put the kettle on.\u0027\\n\\n I step over the children (who are already sprawled out across the living room floor) and head for my usual spot - the armchair in the corner of the room near the back window. I grab the Sunday newspapers off the coffee table as I pass. Burying my head in Harry\u0027s papers always helps me get through these long and monotonous visits.\\n\\n A couple of minutes go by before Harry reappears with a tray of drinks. Vile, milky tea for Liz and me and equally weak, over-diluted fruit juice for the children. I take my tea from him.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 I say quietly. He doesn\u0027t acknowledge me. He hardly even looks at me.\\n\\n I sit down in the corner of the room and start to read. I\u0027m not interested in the politics or the finance or the travel or the style and fashion sections. I head straight for the cartoons. That\u0027s about the level I can cope with today.\\n\\n We\u0027ve been here for almost an hour and I\u0027ve hardly said a word. Lizzie\u0027s been dozing on the sofa on the other side of the room and Harry has been sitting on the floor with the kids. There\u0027s no disputing the fact that they get on well together. He\u0027s laughing and joking with them and they\u0027re loving it. Makes me feel like a bad parent if I\u0027m honest. I don\u0027t enjoy being with the children like he does. Maybe it\u0027s because he can walk away from them and we can\u0027t. They drain me, and I know Lizzie feels the same too. Everything\u0027s an effort when you have kids.\\n\\n \u0027Grandpa just made a coin disappear!\u0027 Ellis squeals, tugging at my trouser leg. Harry fancies himself as something of an amateur magician. He\u0027s always making things disappear and reappear. She squeals again as he \u0027magically\u0027 finds the coin tucked behind her ear. It doesn\u0027t take much to impress a four year old...\\n\\n \u0027Your Uncle Keith\u0027s gone into hospital again,\u0027 Harry says, turning around to speak to Lizzie who stirs and sits up.\\n\\n \u0027How\u0027s Annie coping?\u0027 she asks, covering her hand with her mouth as she yawns. I don\u0027t bother listening to Harry\u0027s answer. I\u0027ve never met Liz\u0027s Uncle Keith or Auntie Annie and I don\u0027t suppose I ever will. I feel like I know them though, the number of times I\u0027ve had to sit here and listen to endless trivial stories about their empty lives on the other side of the country. This happens most Sunday afternoons. Liz and Harry start talking about families and reminiscing and I just switch off. They\u0027ll talk constantly now until we go home about people I\u0027ve never heard of and places I\u0027ve never been.\\n\\n \u0027Mind if I put the football on?\u0027 I ask, noticing the time and stumbling on a way of keeping myself awake. Both Harry and Lizzie look up, surprised that I\u0027ve spoken.\\n\\n \u0027Carry on,\u0027 grumbles Harry. He makes it sound as if watching the match will stop him talking or prevent him from doing something more important. Truth is he likes football as much as I do. I switch on the TV and the room is suddenly filled with noise. I swear he\u0027s going deaf. The volume\u0027s almost at maximum. I turn it down and I\u0027m about to change channels when I stop.\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 I say under my breath.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 asks Liz.\\n\\n \u0027Have you seen this?\u0027\\n\\n I point at the screen. It\u0027s the same news channel I was watching last night. It\u0027s the same story too. The violence I\u0027d seen reported appears to have continued to spread. It looks like a wave of trouble has washed right across our town. Although it looks quieter now the screen shows pictures of damaged buildings and rubbish-filled streets.\\n\\n \u0027I saw this earlier,\u0027 Harry says. \u0027It\u0027s a bloody disgrace if you ask me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s happened?\u0027 asks Liz.\\n\\n \u0027Haven\u0027t you seen any news yet today?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know what it\u0027s like in our house, Dad,\u0027 she replies as she shuffles around to get a better view of the screen. \u0027We\u0027re last on the list when it comes to choosing what we watch on TV.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You want to start putting your foot down,\u0027 he moans, looking directly at me, trying to get me to bite. \u0027Show them you\u0027re in charge. You should never let children rule the roost like that.\u0027\\n\\n I ignore him and answer Liz.\\n\\n \u0027There was some trouble last night,\u0027 I explain. \u0027I saw it before I went to bed. There were a few incidents around town which got out of control.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean, got out of control?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know what it\u0027s like in town on a Saturday. If there\u0027s a night when things will kick off it will always be Saturday. The streets are filled with idiots who are pissed-up and off their faces on drugs. The police can\u0027t cope with them as it is. Apparently it all started with a fight in a bar that got out of hand. More and more people got involved and it turned into a riot.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Grandpa, we saw a fight yesterday,\u0027 Ellis says innocently, looking up from her colouring book. Harry looks at Liz who nods her head.\\n\\n \u0027It was horrible, Dad,\u0027 she explains. \u0027We took Ed to a party at the Kings Head. It was full of football fans. We were having a meal and two of them started fighting.\u0027 She stops speaking and checks that the children aren\u0027t listening. \u0027One of them had a knife,\u0027 she says, her voice a little lower.\\n\\n Harry shakes his head.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a sad state of affairs, it really is,\u0027 he sighs. \u0027It\u0027s almost as if people go out looking for trouble these days.\\n\\n The room falls quiet momentarily.\\n\\n \u0027Hang on,\u0027 Lizzie says suddenly, \u0027did you say this trouble happened here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I answer, nodding my head, \u0027why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because this is talking about somewhere else,\u0027 she says, nodding towards the TV. She\u0027s right. This report is coming from another place further north, and now they\u0027ve cut to a third reporter on the east coast.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s mob violence,\u0027 Harry chunters. \u0027It spreads. People see something on TV and it makes them want to go out and do the same.\u0027\\n\\n He might be right but I doubt it very much. This doesn\u0027t make sense. I can\u0027t imagine that these people are all fighting just for the sake of it. There must be a reason.\\n\\n \u0027There must be more to it than that,\u0027 I say. \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake, Harry, do you really believe these people were just sat watching the trouble on TV one minute and then were out on the streets fighting the next? These riots are hundreds of miles apart. There must be more to it.\u0027\\n\\n For once he doesn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n Another twenty minutes and the children have reached and exceeded their boredom threshold. They\u0027ve started playing up and it\u0027s time to leave. I try to hide my relief as I bundle them into the back of the car. They bicker and fight constantly and I wonder if they\u0027re as wound up about Monday morning as I am. I hate Sunday evenings. All that\u0027s left now is the rush to get everything ready for school and work tomorrow.\\n\\n This is the worst part of the weekend. Nothing to look forward to now except Monday. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-9.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults. Christened “Haters” by the media, the attackers strike without warning and seemingly without reason. Within seconds, normally rational, self-controlled people become frenzied, vicious killers. As the carnage mounts, one thing soon is clear: everyone, irrespective of race, gender, age, or class, has the potential to become either a Hater or a victim. At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent. In the face of this mindless terror, all McCoyne can do is secure his family, seek shelter, and watch as the world falls apart. But when he bolts the front door, the question remains: Is he shutting the danger out or locking it in?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/hater-hater-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:58 AM"}}
