{"id":111985,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"The torrential rain has continued and shows no signs of stopping. The grey clouds overhead are darker than ever and the light is fading quickly. Don\u0027t think I can stay standing like this for much longer. I can\u0027t feel my feet or my hands anymore. The skin on my face is raw and I\u0027m numb with cold. I haven\u0027t had anything to drink all day but my bladder feels full and the pain is excruciating.\\n\\n I\u0027m scared. Every time one of the soldiers near to me moves I catch my breath, not because I\u0027m afraid of them, but because inside I\u0027m screaming with frustration, desperate to fight and to kill the evil scum which is holding us captive here. But I know that I can\u0027t. There are too many of them and they are too heavily armed. If I dared show my intentions they would destroy me in seconds. I can\u0027t let that happen but it\u0027s getting harder and harder to keep these emotions under control. I know that elsewhere along the line other people have been unable to hold back and have paid for it with their lives. Just a few minutes ago I heard a single scream of rage followed by a hail of bullets in the gloom behind me. The silence around us now is somehow even more frightening than the sounds of fighting and death which preceded it.\\n\\n As the day has dragged on it has become impossible to see either end of the line. In the low light I can only see as far as about thirty people ahead of me and a similar number behind. I\u0027m sure that the queue has grown hundreds of people longer. Twice in the last hour or so convoys of empty trucks have driven past us. Logic says they\u0027ve brought more people here and they\u0027re now back out on the streets again looking for others.\\n\\n The girl in front of me is swaying on her feet again. I can\u0027t let her fall. I shuffle forward slightly and put my hand out to steady her.\\n\\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 I hiss under my breath, \u0027not now. Try to hold on...\u0027 I don\u0027t even know if she can hear me over the driving rain.\\n\\n Something\u0027s happening up ahead. I can\u0027t see anything but I can definitely hear something. I peer into the gloom, desperate to try and see what\u0027s going on. Are people finally starting to move? For a few seconds longer I\u0027m unsure but then an unexpected ripple of movement works its way along the line to a point where I can finally see what\u0027s happening. We\u0027re starting to shuffle forward. A sudden wave of awkward, stumbling movement reaches me and for the first time in hours I start to walk. My legs are agonisingly stiff and every step takes a massive amount of effort and coordination. For a moment I stupidly feel relieved when the pain in my aching legs begins to fade slightly, but then I start to think about what we might be walking towards and the panic returns. I know that making a run for it is out of the question for now. Just putting one foot in front of the other is difficult enough. I don\u0027t have the strength or the energy to be able to move any faster.\\n\\n The soldiers continue to march alongside us, keeping their distance most of the time but occasionally hitting and shoving those of us who move too slowly or who stumble out of line. Just ahead another one of the men who travelled in the same truck as me drops to the ground. He\u0027s old and tired and he lies on the gravel track sobbing. I keep walking - I have no choice - and I listen as one of the soldiers yells at him to get back to his feet and keep moving. I wish I could do something to help. I daren\u0027t look round. I hear a single gunshot close behind me and I know that his suffering is over. My fury now feels harder than ever to contain. Despite my exhaustion the urge to turn on these soldiers and fight them - to kill them - is growing stronger by the minute and is almost impossible to suppress. It\u0027s only the obvious fact that any reaction would inevitably be the last thing I do that keeps me in line.\\n\\n We\u0027ve stopped again.\\n\\n Almost as quickly as the movement began it now ends. I have no idea how far we\u0027ve moved. I don\u0027t know how much closer to it I now am but I assume the people at the front of the queue have finally been led down the track towards the entrance to the building.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-41.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
