The soldiers on the streets is the first indication we\u0027ve had that the authorities are at last doing something to help us. I\u0027m glad, but I\u0027ll be happier when they\u0027ve been and gone from here. I don\u0027t say anything to the others. I don\u0027t want the kids and Lizzie getting upset again.\\n\\n My head is spinning. I\u0027m finding it harder and harder to cope with being trapped inside the safe room with the rest of the family. This intense claustrophobia is killing me. We\u0027ve been sat together for hours and hardly anyone has spoken apart from the children who fight and bicker constantly. I know they can\u0027t help it but they\u0027re really beginning to piss me off. Lizzie and Harry don\u0027t seem bothered by them. Maybe it\u0027s just me. Maybe it\u0027s the thought of the soldiers outside. I\u0027m getting increasingly anxious sitting here waiting for the inevitable knock at the door.\\n\\n I use going to the toilet as an excuse to get up and get out of the room. I close the living room door behind me and lean up against it, relieved. The atmosphere in there was oppressive and the air out here is much cooler and fresher. I stumble down the hallway and pause at the front door. Should I go upstairs and check the streets again? What if the army is here already? How would it look if I opened the door and ran head-first into one of those patrols? They might think I was a Hater. Would they give me any chance to explain before aiming their rifles at me?\\n\\n I use the toilet then traipse towards Ed and Josh\u0027s room. I climb up onto Ed\u0027s bed like I did yesterday and stare out of the window for a while. I can\u0027t see anything. If I ignore the bodies then everything looks quiet, still and relatively normal out there. It\u0027s deceptive. Under the surface the whole world is tearing itself apart.\\n\\n My head hurts. I\u0027m tired of thinking constantly about everything that\u0027s happening. I just want to switch off for a while.\\n\\n I roll over onto my back, close my eyes and wait for the knock at the door. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-30.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults. Christened “Haters” by the media, the attackers strike without warning and seemingly without reason. Within seconds, normally rational, self-controlled people become frenzied, vicious killers. As the carnage mounts, one thing soon is clear: everyone, irrespective of race, gender, age, or class, has the potential to become either a Hater or a victim. At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent. In the face of this mindless terror, all McCoyne can do is secure his family, seek shelter, and watch as the world falls apart. But when he bolts the front door, the question remains: Is he shutting the danger out or locking it in?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/hater-hater-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:58 AM"}}
