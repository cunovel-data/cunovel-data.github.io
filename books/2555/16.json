{"id":111962,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Lunchtime. It\u0027s a couple of hours later than I\u0027d originally planned to take my break. It would have been more sensible and probably safer to stay in the office but I\u0027ve had to come outside. I had another call from Lizzie. Her day trapped at home with the kids is getting worse. We need bread and milk but they\u0027re acting up and she can\u0027t face taking them anywhere. I said I\u0027d get some while I was here. I was going to wait until after work but I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t. The supermarket shelves were almost empty. There won\u0027t be anything left tonight. Without thinking I find myself back in Millennium Square again. It\u0027s still not as busy as it normally is but there are plenty of people here and... What the hell was that? I\u0027m stood in the middle of the square by the fountain and everything has just gone crazy. Everyone drops to the ground and I do the same. There was a noise - a single loud crack like a gunshot. But it couldn\u0027t have been, could it? I slowly lift my head from the ground. People are starting to get up. Some are already running in all directions and it\u0027s impossible to see what\u0027s happened. Others like me remain unmoving, trying to work out what\u0027s going on and where the danger is. I have to move. I have to get out of here. I get up and start to run back in the direction of the office but it\u0027s difficult to get through with so many people suddenly zig-zagging all around me. I stop and crouch when I hear the sound again. It was a gunshot. It can\u0027t have been anything else. Just to my left a group of people are screaming and yelling in panic. On the ground, right in the middle of them, is a body. I\u0027m not close enough to see any detail but I can see that there\u0027s a quickly spreading puddle of blood around the top of the person\u0027s head. People start to move again, tripping and stepping over the corpse. Maybe that\u0027s it. Maybe it\u0027s over now. Maybe that\u0027s the body of the Hater lying dead on the ground and things will start to... What now? People are running past me. Have they seen something that I haven\u0027t? I\u0027ve got to get out of here before I get myself... too late - there\u0027s a third gunshot which comes from my left and which sends the crowd scattering in the opposite direction like frightened pigeons. I have to keep moving but my legs feel as heavy as lead. I\u0027m disorientated. I look up at the buildings around the edges of the square, trying to get my bearings and work out which way to run. When I think I finally know which way to go I take a few quick steps forward, weave around another few frightened people, and then stop dead in my tracks. The crowd has cleared ahead of me. No more than ten meters in front of me now stands a police officer, armed like those I saw here this morning. He\u0027s scanning the square, moving his head slowly from side to side. Now he\u0027s stopped and he\u0027s lifting his rifle again. Fuck, he\u0027s pointing it in my direction. Fucking hell, he\u0027s aiming at me! I look straight into his face and he stares back into mine. Do I drop to the ground again? Do I turn and run or...? Fourth gunshot. The officer fires and Jesus Christ, I can almost feel the shot whistle past the side of my face. I slowly look over my shoulder and see another body on the ground not far behind me, a bloody gaping hole in its face where its cheekbone used to be. Shaking, I turn and run. I\u0027m going in the opposite direction from where I want to go but it doesn\u0027t matter. I just have to get out of here. What if it\u0027s me next? What if he\u0027s aiming for me now? Any second and I could hear the crack of the next shot and I could be down with a bullet in my back. I don\u0027t have a fucking chance. Just got to keep moving and hope that someone else gets between me and the gunman. Move faster. Move faster I keep telling myself. Keep running. Get yourself out of range. Keep going until... Fifth shot. Nothing. Didn\u0027t hit me. Sixth, seventh and eighth shots in quick succession. They sounded like they came from a different direction this time? I glance back into the middle of the square. The armed police officer is down. Another officer stands over him and unloads shots nine, ten and eleven into the twitching body of their former colleague. I keep running. As I move a single devastating thought crosses my mind. Was that police officer a Hater? Christ, if there are people in the police force who are capable of this kind of cold-blooded, emotionless violence then what the hell are we supposed to do? The implications are vast and terrifying. Who\u0027s going to keep control? What the hell happens now? I have to get home. Fuck work. Forget about the job. I change direction and run as fast as I can towards the station. I have to get back to Lizzie and the kids.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-16.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.

At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent.
