{"id":111952,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"There\u0027s a girl who sits on the other side of the office called Jennifer Reynolds. I don\u0027t know her very well. I don\u0027t have much to do with her from day to day. In fact I\u0027ve only spoken to her a handful of times since I was transferred into the PFP. She\u0027s not here today and I hate it when she\u0027s out. When Jennifer Reynolds isn\u0027t here her duties get shared out between the rest of us, and the job I have to cover today is the worst job of all - Reception. The postal address of the PFP isn\u0027t actively broadcast but it\u0027s on some of the correspondence we send out and it\u0027s in the phone book and it doesn\u0027t take much for the general public to find out where we are. We get a lot of visitors, too many in my opinion. If someone comes here it\u0027s almost always because they\u0027ve been fined or clamped. They\u0027ve probably already tried to get the fine overturned or the clamp removed and by the time they reach us coming to argue their case in person is often the only option they have left. So those people who do turn up here are likely to already be seriously pissed off. Shouting, screaming and threatening behaviour isn\u0027t unusual. The first place these people reach is Reception, and the first person they get to scream at, shout at or threaten is the poor sod sat behind the desk.\\n\\n So here I am, sitting alone at the Reception desk, staring at the tatty bronzed-glass entrance door, watching anxiously for any visitors. I hate this. It\u0027s like sitting in a dentist\u0027s waiting room. I\u0027m constantly watching the clock on the wall. It\u0027s hung just above a large notice board covered with unread and unhelpful council posters and notices. Just to the left of the notice board, equally unread and unhelpful, is a small sign which warns the public against intimidating or attacking council staff. The fact that it\u0027s there doesn\u0027t make me feel any safer. There\u0027s a personal attack alarm stuck under the desk but that doesn\u0027t make me feel any better either.\\n\\n It\u0027s four thirty-eight. Twenty-two minutes to go then I\u0027m finished for the day.\\n\\n I\u0027m sure Tina enjoys making me come out here. It\u0027s always me who ends up covering for Jennifer. Being out on Reception is a form of torture. You\u0027re not allowed to bring any paperwork out here with you (something about protecting confidential data) and the lack of any distractions makes the time drag painfully slowly. So far this afternoon I\u0027ve only had to deal with two phone calls, and they were just personal calls for members of staff.\\n\\n Four thirty-nine.\\n\\n Come on clock, speed up.\\n\\n Four fifty-four.\\n\\n Almost there. I\u0027m watching the clock all the time now, willing the hands to move round quickly so that I can get out of here. I\u0027m already rehearsing my escape from the office in my head. I just have to shutdown my computer and grab my coat from the cloakroom then I\u0027ll sprint to the station. If I can get away quickly enough I might manage to catch the early train and that\u0027ll get me back home for...\\n\\n Damn. Bloody phone\u0027s ringing again. I hate the way it rings. It grates like an off-key alarm clock and the noise goes right through me. I pick it up and cringe at the thought of what might be waiting for me at the other end of the line.\\n\\n \u0027Good afternoon, PFP, Danny McCoyne speaking,\u0027 I mumble quickly. I\u0027ve learnt to answer the phone quietly and at speed. It makes it difficult for the caller to take your name.\\n\\n \u0027Can I speak to Mr Fitzpatrick in Payroll please?\u0027 a heavily accented female voice asks. Thank God for that - this isn\u0027t a screaming member of the public with a complaint, it\u0027s just a wrong number. I relax. We get a few calls for Payroll most days. Their extensions are similar to ours. You\u0027d think someone would do something about it. Anyway I\u0027m relieved. The last thing I want is a problem at four fifty-five.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve come through to the wrong department,\u0027 I explain. \u0027You\u0027ve dialled 2300 instead of 3200. I\u0027ll try and transfer you. If you get cut-off just dial 1000 and that\u0027ll take you through to the main exchange...\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027m suddenly distracted and my voice trails away as the front door flies open. I instinctively move back on my chair, trying to put as much distance as possible between me and whoever it is who\u0027s about to come storming into the building. I finish the phone call and allow myself to relax slightly when I see the front wheels of a child\u0027s pushchair being forced through the door. The pushchair is jammed in the doorway and I get up to help. A short, rain-soaked woman in a green and purple anorak enters Reception. As well as the child in the pushchair (which is hidden from view by a heavy plastic rain-cover) two more small children follow her inside. The bedraggled family stand in the middle of the Reception area and drip water onto the grubby marble-effect floor. The woman seems harassed and is pre-occupied with her kids. She snaps at the tallest child, telling him that \u0027Mummy has a problem to sort out with this man, then we\u0027ll get you back home for something to eat.\u0027\\n\\n She takes off her hood and I can see that she\u0027s in her late thirties or early forties. She\u0027s plain looking and her large, round, rain-splashed glasses are steaming up. Her face is flushed red and there are dribbles of rainwater dripping off the end of her nose. She doesn\u0027t make eye contact with me. She slams her handbag down on the desk and begins searching through it. She stops for a moment to lift the rain-cover (which is also beginning to steam up with condensation) and checks on her baby who seems to be sleeping. She returns her attention to the contents of her handbag and I make my way back around to the other side of the counter.\\n\\n \u0027Can I help you?\u0027 I ask cautiously, deciding that it\u0027s about time I offered. She glares at me over the rim of her glasses. This woman has an attitude, I can sense it. She\u0027s making me feel uncomfortable. I know I\u0027m in for a hard time.\\n\\n \u0027Wait a minute,\u0027 she snaps, talking to me as if I\u0027m one of her kids. She takes a packet of tissues out of her bag and passes one to one of the children at her feet who keeps wiping his nose on the back of his sleeve. \u0027Blow,\u0027 she orders sternly, shoving the tissue into the middle of the kid\u0027s face. The child doesn\u0027t argue.\\n\\n I glance up at the clock. Four fifty-seven. Doesn\u0027t look like I\u0027ll be getting the early train home tonight.\\n\\n \u0027I parked my car at Leftbank Place for five minutes while I took my eldest son to the toilet,\u0027 she begins as she repacks her bag. No time for niceties, she\u0027s straight into her complaint. \u0027In those five minutes my car was clamped. Now I know that I shouldn\u0027t have been parked there, but it was only for five minutes and I was only there because it was absolutely necessary. I want to speak to someone who has the authority to sort this out and I want to speak to them now. I want that clamp removed from my car so I can get my children home.\u0027\\n\\n I clear my throat and get ready to try and respond. Suddenly my mouth is dry and my tongue feels twice its normal size. It had to be Leftbank Place, didn\u0027t it. It\u0027s an area of waste ground just ten minutes walk from our office. Sometimes it feels like just about every other car that\u0027s clamped in this town is clamped at Leftbank Place. The enforcement team who cover that area are notorious. Someone told me they\u0027re on some kind of performance-related pay scheme - the more cars they clamp each week, the more they get paid. I don\u0027t know whether or not that\u0027s true but it doesn\u0027t help me now. I know I have no choice but to give this woman a stock response from procedures. I also know that she\u0027s not going to like it.\\n\\n \u0027Madam,\u0027 I begin, tensing up in anticipation of her reaction, \u0027Leftbank Place is a strictly no parking area. The council...\u0027\\n\\n She doesn\u0027t give me chance to get any further.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you about the council,\u0027 she yells, her voice suddenly uncomfortably loud. \u0027This bloody council needs to spend less time clamping people and more time making sure that public amenities are in proper working order. The only reason I had to park at bloody Leftbank Place was because the public toilets in Millennium Square have been vandalised! My son has a bowel condition. I didn\u0027t have any choice. He couldn\u0027t wait any longer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There must have been other toilets...\u0027 I begin to say, instantly regretting having opened my mouth. Christ I hate this job. I wish I was back dealing with rubbish collections, rat infestations or even broken street lamps again. My biggest problem is that it sounds like this woman has been genuinely hard done by and I\u0027d probably have done exactly the same as she did if I\u0027d been out with my kids. It sounds like she\u0027s got a fair point and there\u0027s nothing I\u0027d like to do more than call off the clampers but I don\u0027t have the authority. My options now are bleak; follow procedures and get yelled at again by this lady or get yelled at by Tina Murray if I don\u0027t do things by the book. Chances are I\u0027m going to cop it from both of them. Before she can react to my stupid comment I try and cover it up. \u0027I understand what you\u0027re saying, Madam, but...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you?\u0027 she screams, this time loud enough to wake the baby in the pushchair who starts to whimper and moan. \u0027Do you really? I don\u0027t think you do, because if you did understand you\u0027d be on the phone to someone right now getting that bloody clamp removed from my car so that I can get my children home. They\u0027re cold, they\u0027re hungry and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I need to just...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want excuses, I want this dealt with.\u0027\\n\\n She\u0027s not going to listen. This is pointless. She isn\u0027t even going to give me a chance.\\n\\n \u0027Madam...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suggest you go and speak to your superiors and find someone who\u0027s prepared to take responsibility for this shoddy mess and come and sort it out. I was forced to park at Leftbank Place because of this council\u0027s inefficiencies. I have a son who has a medical condition and I needed to get him to the toilet urgently. If the council had done their job properly in the first place and had made sure the public toilets were in full working order then I wouldn\u0027t have been parked there, I wouldn\u0027t have been clamped and I wouldn\u0027t be stood here now talking to someone who clearly can\u0027t or won\u0027t do anything to help me. I need to speak to someone who\u0027s a little higher up the chain of command than the receptionist so why don\u0027t you do us both a favour and go and find someone who is actually prepared to do something before my son needs to use the toilet again.\u0027\\n\\n Patronising bitch. I stand and stare at her, feeling myself getting angrier and angrier. But there\u0027s nothing I can do...\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 she snaps.\\n\\n \u0027Just give me a minute, madam,\u0027 I stammer. I turn and storm back into the office and walk straight into Tina coming the other way.\\n\\n \u0027What are you doing in here, Danny?\u0027 she asks, her tone of voice as patronising as the woman outside. \u0027If you\u0027re in here, who\u0027s manning Reception?\u0027\\n\\n She knows full well there\u0027s no-one out there. I try and explain but I know it\u0027s pointless.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got a lady out in Reception who...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You should have telephoned through if you needed help,\u0027 she interrupts. \u0027You know the rules, you\u0027ve been here long enough now. There should always be someone at the Reception desk and you should always telephone through if you have a problem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There is someone at the Reception desk,\u0027 I sigh, \u0027and she\u0027s having a real go at me so can I tell you what her problem is please?\u0027\\n\\n She looks up at the clock. Damn, it\u0027s gone five. I\u0027ll probably be stuck at the station until six now.\\n\\n \u0027Make it quick,\u0027 she sneers, making it sound as if she\u0027s doing me a favour.\\n\\n \u0027This lady has been clamped because she parked at Leftbank Place...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tough! You can\u0027t park at Leftbank Place. There are bloody big signs up everywhere telling you not to park at Leftbank Place.\u0027\\n\\n This isn\u0027t getting any easier.\\n\\n \u0027I know that, you know that and she knows that. That\u0027s not the issue.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean, that\u0027s not the issue?\u0027\\n\\n I pause before speaking again. I know I\u0027m going to have a battle convincing Tina that this lady has a genuine case. For a moment I consider giving up and taking my chances outside in Reception again.\\n\\n \u0027This lady tells me she parked at Leftbank Place because she needed to take her son to the toilet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What kind of an excuse is that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She needed to take him to the toilet because he has a medical condition and because the public toilets in Millennium Square have been vandalised.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not our problem...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, but her argument is that it is the council\u0027s problem. She\u0027s demanding we get the clamp removed. Won\u0027t go anywhere until it\u0027s done.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She can\u0027t go anywhere,\u0027 Tina laughs to herself. \u0027We\u0027ll get the clamp removed when she pays the fine.\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027m not surprised by her response, just disappointed. I want to go home. I don\u0027t want to go out there and get yelled at again. What annoys me most of all it that we both know the longer this lady stands her ground and makes a noise in Reception, the more chance there is that the clamp will be removed. I can\u0027t stand all this bullshit and pretence. I can\u0027t help but say something.\\n\\n \u0027Come on, Tina, give me a break. You know as well as I do that if she shouts long enough we\u0027ll let her off.\u0027\\n\\n She looks at me, chews her gum and shrugs her shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s as maybe, but we have to try and take the fee from the client first. You know the procedure. We have to...\u0027\\n\\n There\u0027s no point listening to any more of this rubbish. I can\u0027t be bothered.\\n\\n \u0027I know the bloody procedure,\u0027 I sigh as I turn my back on her and trudge back towards Reception. I wonder whether I should just keep going? Should I walk straight past the woman and her kids and just leave the building and the job behind?\\n\\n I open the door and she turns round to glare at me. The expression on her face is pure evil.\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027\\n\\n I take a deep breath.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve had a word with my supervisor,\u0027 I begin dejectedly, knowing what\u0027s coming next. \u0027We can get the clamp removed, but we must insist on payment of the charge indicated on the signs displayed at Leftbank Place. We can\u0027t...\u0027\\n\\n And she\u0027s off. She explodes again, shouting and yelling at me. The force, velocity and ferocity of her outburst is remarkable. It\u0027s an incredible (but not at all unexpected) rant and I have no defence. I can\u0027t argue because I happen to think she has a valid case. If she\u0027d just shut up for a second I might be able to... oh, what\u0027s the use? I don\u0027t know why I bother. The more she shouts at me the less I\u0027m inclined to listen. I\u0027ve given up trying to follow what she\u0027s saying now. Her words have just become a constant stream of noise. I\u0027ll wait for her to take a breath.\\n\\n \u0027Madam,\u0027 I interrupt quickly as she pauses to inhale. I hold my hand up in front of me to make it clear that it\u0027s my turn to speak. \u0027I\u0027ll go and get my supervisor.\u0027\\n\\n I walk away, ignoring the muttered comments I can hear about \u0027speaking to the organ grinder, not the monkey.\u0027 I\u0027m long past caring. As I reach for the office door Tina pulls it open from the other side and barges past me. She stops just long enough to hiss a few venomous words in my direction.\\n\\n \u0027Well handled,\u0027 she sneers sarcastically. \u0027You\u0027re bloody useless, you are. I could hear her shouting from my desk. Now what\u0027s her name?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I admit, cringing at the fact that I haven\u0027t even managed to establish the most basic of details.\\n\\n \u0027Bloody useless,\u0027 she sneers again before fixing a false smile on her foul face and marching over to the bedraggled woman and her children. \u0027My name\u0027s Tina Murray,\u0027 she says, \u0027how can I help you?\u0027\\n\\n I lean against the office door and watch the predictable charade being played out. Tina listens to the complaint, points out to the lady that she really shouldn\u0027t have been parked at Leftbank Place, then makes a phone call to \u0027see what she can do.\u0027 Ten minutes later and the clamp is removed. Tina looks fantastic and I look like an idiot. I knew it would happen like that.\\n\\n Five thirty-two.\\n\\n I run to the station and reach the platform just in time to see the next train leave. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-3.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
