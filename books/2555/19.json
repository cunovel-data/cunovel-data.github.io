{"id":111965,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"It\u0027s dark. The house is silent. I\u0027m tired but I can\u0027t sleep. It\u0027s almost two in the morning. \u0027You awake?\u0027 I ask quietly. \u0027Wide awake,\u0027 Lizzie answers. I roll over onto my side and gently put my arm around her. She does the same and I pull her closer. It feels good to have her next to me like this. It\u0027s been too long. \u0027What are you going to do in the morning?\u0027 she asks. The side of her face is touching mine. I can feel her breath on my skin. \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I answer quickly. I want to stay at home but there\u0027s a part of me that still thinks I should go back to work. The longer I\u0027ve laid here awake, the more I\u0027ve slowly managed to convince myself that it will be safe to go back to the office tomorrow. Stupid bloody idiot. I watched people being shot in the middle of town today. There\u0027s no way I can go back there. \u0027Stay here,\u0027 she says quietly. \u0027Stay here with us. You should be here with me and the children.\u0027 \u0027I know, but...\u0027 I start to mumble. \u0027But nothing. We need you here. I need you here. I\u0027m scared.\u0027 I know she\u0027s right. I wrap my arms further around her and run my hand down the ridge of her spine. She\u0027s wearing a short nightdress. I put my hand underneath it and feel her back again. Her skin is soft and warm. I expect her to grumble and pull away from me like she usually does but she stays where she is. I can feel her hands on my skin now. \u0027Stay here with me,\u0027 she whispers again, slowly moving her hand across my backside and down before sliding it between my legs. She starts to stroke me and despite all the fear, confusion and uncertainty we\u0027re both feeling I\u0027m hard in seconds. I can\u0027t remember the last time we were intimate. There always seems to be a reason why we can\u0027t be close. Something or someone always gets in the way. \u0027How long\u0027s it been?\u0027 I ask, keeping my voice low. \u0027Too long,\u0027 she answers. Lizzie rolls over onto her back and I climb on top of her. I carefully slide inside her and she grips me tightly. I can feel her nails digging into my skin. She wants me as much as I want her. We both need each other tonight. Neither of us says a word. No talking. There\u0027s nothing to say. It\u0027s four-thirty. I don\u0027t remember what happened. I must have fallen asleep. It\u0027s still dark in here and the bed\u0027s empty. I look round and see Lizzie standing by the door. \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 \u0027Listen,\u0027 she whispers. I rub sleep from my eyes and sit up. I can hear noises coming from above us. The sounds are quiet and muffled. Something\u0027s happening in the other occupied flat upstairs. There are voices - raised voices - and then the sound of breaking glass. \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 I ask, still drugged with sleep. \u0027This started about five minutes ago,\u0027 she explains as the voices above us get louder. \u0027I couldn\u0027t sleep. I thought...\u0027 A sudden thump from the flat above interrupts her. Now the whole building is silent. It\u0027s a long, uncomfortable and ominous silence which makes me catch my breath. The bedroom is cold and I start to shiver through a combination of the low temperature and nerves. Lizzie turns round to face me and is about to speak when another noise makes her stop. It\u0027s the sound of a door slamming upstairs. Seconds later and we hear hurried, uneven footsteps in the lobby outside, then the familiar creak of the front entrance door being pulled open. I start to get out of bed. \u0027Where are you going?\u0027 she asks. \u0027I just want to see...\u0027 I start to say although I\u0027m not really sure what I\u0027m doing. \u0027Don\u0027t,\u0027 she pleads, \u0027please don\u0027t. Just stay here. Our door\u0027s locked and the windows are shut. We\u0027re both safe and so are the kids. It doesn\u0027t matter about anybody else. Don\u0027t get involved. Whatever\u0027s going on out there, don\u0027t get involved...\u0027 I have no intention of going outside, I just want to see what\u0027s happening. I go into the living room. I hear a car\u0027s engine start and I peer through the curtains, making sure I can\u0027t be seen. One of the men from upstairs - I can\u0027t see which one - drives away at an incredible speed. I couldn\u0027t make out much detail, but I did see that there was only one person in the car and that immediately starts me thinking about who, or what, is left upstairs. I turn around and see that Lizzie is in the living room with me now. \u0027Maybe I should go up and check...?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re not going anywhere,\u0027 she hisses. \u0027Like I said, our door\u0027s locked and the windows are shut. We\u0027re safe here and you\u0027re not going anywhere.\u0027 \u0027But what if something\u0027s happened up there? What if someone\u0027s hurt?\u0027 \u0027Then that\u0027s someone else\u0027s problem. I don\u0027t care. All we need to think about is the children and each other. You\u0027re not going anywhere.\u0027 I know she\u0027s right. Out of duty I pick up the telephone and try to dial the emergency services. Christ, I can\u0027t even get an answer. Lizzie goes back to bed. I\u0027ll follow her in a couple of minutes but I already know I won\u0027t sleep again tonight. I\u0027m scared. I\u0027m scared because whatever it is that we\u0027ve seen happening to the rest of the world now suddenly feels a whole lot closer.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-19.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.

As the carnage mounts, one thing soon is clear: everyone, irrespective of race, gender, age, or class, has the potential to become either a Hater or a victim. At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent.
