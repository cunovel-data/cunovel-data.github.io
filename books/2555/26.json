{"id":111971,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"The kids have definitely sensed a change now. Maybe it\u0027s because they\u0027ve been trapped in the flat without contact from anyone else for days. Obviously what they\u0027ve seen today has made matters worse. They keep asking questions and I don\u0027t know how to answer them. I don\u0027t know what to say to them anymore. I took the bolt I fixed on Sunday morning off the bathroom door and attached it to the inside of the living room (or \u0027safe room\u0027 as we\u0027re now supposed to call it) to try and make everyone feel a little safer. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s done any good.\n We\u0027ve been sitting in the safe room for hours and I can\u0027t stand it any longer. I get up and wander aimlessly around the flat. I can\u0027t sit and do nothing, but there\u0027s nothing I can do either. I don\u0027t want to talk to anyone. I\u0027m cold and tired and frightened. I walk into Josh and Ed\u0027s small room and climb up onto Ed\u0027s top bunk. His small screen TV is at the end of the bed. I switch it on and flick through the channels. Nothing worth watching. There are a couple of channels showing repeats of old TV shows, the rest are just showing the public information film that we saw earlier. It\u0027s running at exactly the same time on all the major national channels. It must be produced and broadcast by the government. At least I assume it\u0027s the government. Who else could it be?\n With nothing on TV and no other distractions I find myself looking out of the window just to the side of the bed. I lie down flat on my stomach on the narrow bunk and stare out through the net curtain at the street outside. From here I can see along the full length of Calder Grove - from the still smoking bodies of Woods and his wife right down to the junction of the road with Gregory Street. Apart from the drifting smoke everything else is still. The world feels silent and deserted, as if we\u0027ve all been put in quarantine from each other. Now and again I catch sight of a lonely figure in the distance. People stick to the shadows and they\u0027re gone as quickly as they appear. There\u0027s hardly any other movement at all. Once in a while a car passes by, otherwise nothing else seems to move. It\u0027s like looking at a freeze-frame photograph of the world.\n Why hasn\u0027t anyone done anything about the corpses? We\u0027ve kept the curtains in the living room closed so the kids can\u0027t see them. If Woods\u0027 wife\u0027s body is still there in the morning I might go and throw a blanket over it just so it\u0027s out of view. I can see the blackened remains of the dead woman\u0027s arms. Her bony hands and fingers are lifted up and clasped together like she\u0027s praying or pleading for help.\n I don\u0027t know what we\u0027re going to do. I\u0027m trying not to panic. I don\u0027t think we have any choice but to lock ourselves in here and sit this thing out, however long that takes. I don\u0027t want to...\n \u0027What are you looking at?\u0027 a voice suddenly asks from beside me, making me jump. I look round and see that it\u0027s Ellis. She\u0027s crept into the bedroom and has managed to climb the ladder up to Ed\u0027s bed. She peers at me over the top rung with wide, saucer-shaped eyes.\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 I answer, rolling over and giving her space to climb up with me. She puffs and pants and drags herself onto the bed.\n \u0027What are you doing in here?\u0027\n It\u0027s difficult to answer. I\u0027m not exactly sure myself.\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 I say again.\n \u0027You looking at the dead lady?\u0027 she asks in a remarkably innocent and matter-of-fact way.\n \u0027No, I\u0027m just lying down for a while. I\u0027m tired.\u0027\n \u0027Why are you lying on Ed\u0027s bed? Why aren\u0027t you lying on yours and Mummy\u0027s bed?\u0027\n Her questions never seem to stop. I wish they would. I\u0027m not in the mood to answer them.\n \u0027I wanted to watch the TV,\u0027 I tell her, not being entirely honest. \u0027I haven\u0027t got one in my bedroom.\u0027\n \u0027Why not watch the other telly with the rest of us?\u0027\n \u0027Ellis,\u0027 I say, stifling a yawn and pulling her closer, \u0027shut up, will you.\u0027\n \u0027You shut up,\u0027 she mumbles under her breath. She yawns too and shuffles closer to me.\n For a little while the room is quiet again and I begin to wonder whether Ellis has fallen asleep. But it\u0027s not just this room that\u0027s quiet - the whole flat is ominously silent. In the distance I can just about hear the muffled sounds of the TV in the living room. Are they being quiet or is there something wrong with the others? Is it because of what\u0027s happening outside, or is the isolation and uncertainty starting to have an effect on the rest of my family? Is one of them about to start changing, or have they already changed...? I find myself thinking about what\u0027s happening outside again and I\u0027m depressed by a constant stream of dark and uncomfortable thoughts. Surely things can\u0027t continue like this indefinitely? There has to come a point when something gives or the situation resolves itself, doesn\u0027t there? I don\u0027t have any answers and I\u0027m actually relieved when Ellis decides to attack me with another barrage of much easier questions.\n \u0027Will we be going back to school tomorrow?\u0027 she asks naively.\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 I reply.\n \u0027The next day?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\n \u0027The next day?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Look, Ellis, we don\u0027t know when school\u0027s going to be open again. Hopefully it won\u0027t be too long.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m going on a trip next week.\u0027\n \u0027I know.\u0027\n \u0027My class is going to a farm.\u0027\n \u0027I know.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re going on a coach.\u0027\n \u0027I know.\u0027\n \u0027Will we still be able to go?\u0027\n \u0027I hope so.\u0027\n \u0027Will you take me if school\u0027s still shut?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll take you.\u0027\n She seems happy with that and, again, she becomes quiet. I lie back and close my eyes. The day so far has been long and emotionally draining and it has taken its toll. My eyes feel heavy. In just a few short minutes I feel Ellis\u0027 body go limp in my arms. Her breathing changes, becoming shallow and steady and I look down at her. She\u0027s dozing, completely relaxed and almost asleep. In a world which has suddenly become completely irrational, unpredictable and fucked-up she remains perfect and unaltered. This little girl means everything to me.\n I\u0027m tired. I close my eyes.\n I was almost asleep for a second until the image of the girl in the supermarket this morning returned. For a terrifying moment I imagined that it was Ellis, and that she was attacking Lizzie lying on the ground. I\u0027m frightened. I\u0027m petrified by the prospect that whatever it is that\u0027s happening outside will eventually find its way into my home and harm my family.\n I try to imagine this beautiful little girl attacking me.\n I try to imagine me attacking her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-26.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Hater (Hater #1) \n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
