Christ, he came out of nowhere and she didn\u0027t stand a chance, poor old girl. He\u0027s in the middle of the crowd now. He\u0027s outnumbered fifty-to-one and yet he\u0027s still trying to fight. This place is full of crazy people. Fortunately for that woman it\u0027s also full of police officers. There are two of them down with her now, trying to stop the bleeding. Three more have got to the bloke that did it and they\u0027re dragging him away. Damn, it\u0027s three minutes to nine. I\u0027m going to be late for work again but I can\u0027t move. I\u0027m stuck in this bloody crowd. There are people bunched up tight all around me and I can\u0027t go backwards or forwards. I\u0027ll have to wait until they start to shift, however long that takes. There are more police officers arriving now trying to clear the scene. It\u0027s pathetic really, you\u0027d think they\u0027d show some respect but people are all the same. First sign of trouble on the street and everyone stops to watch the freak show. We\u0027re finally starting to move. I can still see that bloke being bundled towards a police van on the other side of the street. He\u0027s kicking and screaming and crying like a bloody baby. Looks like he\u0027s lost it completely. The noise he\u0027s making you\u0027d think he was the one who\u0027d been attacked. I know I\u0027m a lazy bastard. I know I should try harder but I just can\u0027t be bothered. I\u0027m not stupid but I sometimes find it difficult to give a shit. I should have run across Millennium Square to get to the office just now but it was too much effort so early in the morning. I walked and I finally got here at just gone quarter past nine. I tried to sneak in but it was inevitable that someone was going to see me. It had to be Tina Murray though, didn\u0027t it? My sour-faced, slave-driving, unforgiving bitch of a supervisor. She\u0027s standing behind me now, watching me work. She thinks I don\u0027t know she\u0027s there. I really can\u0027t stand her. In fact I can\u0027t think of anyone I like less than Tina. I\u0027m not a violent man - I don\u0027t like confrontation and I find the very idea of punching a woman offensive - but there are times here when I\u0027d happily smack her in the mouth. \u0027You owe me fifteen minutes,\u0027 she sneers in her horrible, whining voice. I push myself back on my chair and slowly turn around to face her. I force myself to smile although all I want to do is spit. She stands in front of me, arms folded, chewing gum and scowling. \u0027Morning, Tina,\u0027 I reply, trying to stay calm and not give her the satisfaction of knowing just how much she winds me up, \u0027how are you today?\u0027 \u0027You can either take the time off your lunch hour or stay back tonight and work over,\u0027 she snaps. \u0027It\u0027s up to you how you make it up.\u0027 I know I\u0027m only making things worse for myself but I can\u0027t help it. I should just keep my mouth shut and accept that I\u0027m in the wrong but I can\u0027t stand the thought of this vile woman thinking she\u0027s in control. I know I\u0027m not helping the situation but I just can\u0027t stop myself. I have to say something. \u0027What about yesterday morning?\u0027 I ask. I force myself to look into her harsh, scowling face again. She\u0027s not at all happy. She shifts her weight from one foot to the other and chews her gum even harder and faster. Her jaw moves in a frantic circular motion. She looks like a cow chewing the cud. Fucking heifer. \u0027What about yesterday morning?\u0027 she spits. \u0027Well,\u0027 I explain, trying hard not to sound like I\u0027m patronising her, \u0027if you remember I was twenty minutes early yesterday and I started working as soon as I got here. If I\u0027m going to make up your fifteen minutes for today, can I claim back my twenty minutes for yesterday? Or shall we just call it quits and I\u0027ll let you off the five minutes?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be stupid. You know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027 \u0027Maybe it should.\u0027 Bloody hell, now she\u0027s really annoyed. Her face is flushed red and I can see the veins on her neck bulging. It was a stupid and pointless comment to make but I\u0027m right, aren\u0027t I? Why should the council have it all their own way? Tina\u0027s staring at me now and her silence is making me feel really uncomfortable. I should have just kept my mouth closed. I let her win the face-off and I turn back round to sign-on to my computer again. \u0027Either take it off your lunch hour or work over,\u0027 she says over her shoulder as she walks away. \u0027I don\u0027t care what you do, just make sure you make up the time you owe.\u0027 And she\u0027s off. Conversation\u0027s over and I don\u0027t get any chance to respond or to try and get the last word. Bitch. Tina makes my skin crawl but I find myself staring at her rather than my computer screen. She\u0027s back at her desk now and Barry Penny, the office manager, has suddenly appeared. Her body language has completely changed now that she\u0027s speaking to someone who\u0027s higher up the council pecking order than she is. She\u0027s smiling and laughing at his pathetic jokes and generally trying to see how far she can crawl up his backside. I can\u0027t help thinking about what I\u0027ve just seen happen outside. Christ, I wish I had that bloke\u0027s umbrella. I know exactly where I\u0027d shove it. Sometimes having such a dull and monotonous job is an advantage. This stuff is way beneath me and I don\u0027t really have to think about what I\u0027m doing. I can do my work on autopilot and the time passes quickly. It\u0027s been like that so far this morning. Job satisfaction is non-existent but at least the day isn\u0027t dragging. I\u0027ve been working here for almost eight months now (it feels longer) and I\u0027ve worked for the council for the last three and a half years. In that time I\u0027ve worked my way through more departments than most long-serving council staff manage in their entire careers. I keep getting transferred. I served time in the pest control, refuse collection and street lamp maintenance departments before I ended up here in the Parking Fine Processing office or PFP as the council likes to call it. They have an irritating habit of trying to reduce as many department names and job titles down to sets of initials as they can. Before I was transferred here I\u0027d been told that the PFP was a dumping ground for underperformers and, as soon as I arrived, I realised it was true. In most of the places I\u0027ve worked I\u0027ve either liked the job but not the people or the other way around. Here I have problems with both. This place is a breeding ground for trouble. This is where those motorists who\u0027ve been unlucky (or stupid) enough to get wheel-clamped, caught on camera or given a ticket by a parking warden come to shout and scream and dispute their fines. I used to have sympathy with them and I believed their stories. Eight months here has changed me. Now I don\u0027t believe anything that anyone tells me. \u0027Did you see that bloke this morning?\u0027 a voice asks from behind the computer on my left. It\u0027s Kieran Smyth. I like Kieran. Like most of us he\u0027s wasted here. He\u0027s got brains and he could make something of himself if he tried. He was studying law at university but took a holiday job here last summer and never went back to class. Told me he got used to having the money and couldn\u0027t cope without it. He buys an incredible amount of stuff. Every day he seems to come back from lunch with bags of clothes, books, DVDs and CDs. I\u0027m just jealous because I struggle to scrape together enough money to buy food, never mind anything else. Kieran spends most of his day talking to his mate Daryl Evans who sits on my right. They talk through me and over me but very rarely to me. It doesn\u0027t bother me though. Their conversations are as boring as hell and the only thing I have in common with them is that the three of us all work within the same small section of the same small office. What does annoy me, if I\u0027m honest, is the fact that they both seem to be able to get away with not doing very much for large chunks of the working day. Maybe it\u0027s because they\u0027re friendly with Tina outside work and they go out drinking together. Christ, I only have to cough and she\u0027s up out of her seat wanting to know what I\u0027m doing and why I\u0027ve stopped working. \u0027What bloke?\u0027 Daryl shouts back. \u0027Out on the street on the way to work.\u0027 \u0027Which street?\u0027 \u0027The high street, just outside Cartwrights.\u0027 \u0027Didn\u0027t see anything.\u0027 \u0027You must have.\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t walk past Cartwrights. I came the other way this morning.\u0027 \u0027There was this bloke,\u0027 Kieran explains regardless, \u0027you should have seen him. He went absolutely fucking mental.\u0027 \u0027What are you on about?\u0027 \u0027Honest mate, he was wild. You ask Bob Rawlings up in Archives. He saw it. He reckons he practically killed her.\u0027 \u0027Killed who?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know, just some old woman. No word of a lie, he just started laying into her for no reason. Stabbed her with a bloody umbrella I heard!\u0027 \u0027Now you\u0027re taking the piss...\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m serious.\u0027 \u0027No way!\u0027 \u0027You go and ask Bob...\u0027 I usually ignore these quick-fire conversations (most of the time I don\u0027t have a clue what they\u0027re talking about) but today I can actually add something because I was there. It\u0027s pathetic, I know, but the fact that I seem to know more about what happened than either Kieran or Daryl makes me feel smug and superior. \u0027He\u0027s right,\u0027 I say, looking up from my screen. \u0027Did you see it then?\u0027 Kieran asks. I lean back on my seat in self-satisfaction. \u0027Happened right in front of me. He might even have gone for me if I\u0027d been a few seconds earlier.\u0027 \u0027So what was it all about?\u0027 Daryl asks. \u0027Is what he\u0027s saying right?\u0027 I quickly look over at Tina. She\u0027s got her head buried in a pile of papers. It\u0027s safe to keep talking. \u0027I saw the old girl first,\u0027 I tell them. \u0027I nearly tripped over her. She came flying past me and smashed up against the window by the side door of Cartwrights. I thought it must be a group of kids trying to get her bag off her or something like that. Couldn\u0027t believe it when I saw him. He just looked like a normal bloke. Suit, tie, glasses...\u0027 \u0027So why did he do it? What had she done to him?\u0027 \u0027No idea. Bloody hell, mood he was in I wasn\u0027t about to ask him.\u0027 \u0027And he just went for her?\u0027 Daryl mumbles, sounding like he doesn\u0027t believe a word I\u0027m saying. I nod and glance from side to side at both of them. \u0027Never seen anything like it,\u0027 I continue. \u0027He ran at her and stabbed her with an umbrella. It was gross. It went right into her belly. There was blood all over her coat and...\u0027 Tina\u0027s looking up now. I look down and start typing, trying to remember what it was I was doing. \u0027Then what?\u0027 Kieran hisses. \u0027Idiot turned on the rest of the crowd. Started hitting out at the people around him. Then the police turned up,\u0027 I explain, still looking at my screen but not actually doing anything. \u0027They dragged him away and shoved him in the back of a van.\u0027 The conversation stops again. Murray\u0027s on the move. For a moment the only sound I can hear is the clicking of three computer keyboards as we pretend to work. After looking around the room and staring at me in particular she leaves the office and Kieran and Daryl immediately stop inputting. \u0027So was there something wrong with him?\u0027 Daryl asks pointlessly. \u0027Of course there was something wrong with him,\u0027 I answer. Christ, this bloke\u0027s an idiot at times. \u0027Do you think he\u0027d stab an old lady with an umbrella if there wasn\u0027t anything wrong with him?\u0027 \u0027But did he say anything? Was he screaming or shouting or...?\u0027 I wonder whether it\u0027s even worth answering his half-asked question. \u0027Both,\u0027 I grunt. \u0027Was he drunk or on drugs or...?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I say, beginning to get annoyed. I stop and think for a second before speaking again. In my head I can still see the expression on the man\u0027s face. \u0027He looked absolutely fucking terrified,\u0027 I tell them. \u0027He looked like he was the one who was being attacked.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-2.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
