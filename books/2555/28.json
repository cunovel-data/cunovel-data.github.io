{"id":111973,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"FRIDAY 27 Not sure what time I finally went to sleep. I lay on the bed for hours trying (and failing) to make sense of everything that\u0027s happening. I must have looked at the alarm clock a hundred times or more in the night. I watched every hour tick by... \u0027Dad.\u0027 I\u0027m still half-asleep but Ed wakes me up. I sit up quickly. What\u0027s wrong? What\u0027s happened? I rub my eyes and try to focus on my son\u0027s face. The room\u0027s dark but I think he\u0027s okay. I look down and see that Lizzie\u0027s still sleeping next to me in bed. She seems okay too. \u0027Dad,\u0027 he says again, annoyed that I haven\u0027t answered. \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 I mumble. \u0027Are the others all right?\u0027 He nods. What he wants to tell me has obviously got nothing to do with Ellis or Josh. \u0027The telly\u0027s bust,\u0027 he grunts. I slump back on my pillow, relieved. Is that all? Thank God for that. \u0027What\u0027s the matter with it?\u0027 I ask, struggling to sound interested. \u0027Can\u0027t get a picture.\u0027 \u0027Is it plugged in?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 he groans, \u0027I\u0027m not stupid.\u0027 I\u0027m too tired to pick him up for being rude. \u0027Have you checked the cables at the back?\u0027 \u0027I haven\u0027t touched them. It was working yesterday, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027What about the telly in your bedroom?\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t get the channel I want on my telly. Come on Dad, get up.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll come and have a look in a couple of minutes,\u0027 I yawn. \u0027Let me stay here for a bit longer...\u0027 \u0027But my programme\u0027s on now,\u0027 he protests. \u0027Please, Dad.\u0027 I close my eyes for a few seconds longer but it\u0027s obvious that I\u0027m not going to get any peace until Ed\u0027s got the TV fixed. Cursing under my breath I get up and stumble across the cold bedroom floor and down the hallway, side-stepping Harry as I meet him by the kitchen door. Ed follows then pushes past me as we reach the living room. He picks up the remote control and switches on the TV. \u0027See...\u0027 he says, flicking through the channels. I sit and stare at the screen. \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 Harry asks, as he wearily drags himself into the room after us. \u0027Telly\u0027s broke,\u0027 Ed tells him. \u0027It\u0027s not broken,\u0027 I say as I flick through the channels. \u0027Have you checked the aerial?\u0027 Harry suggests. \u0027There\u0027s nothing wrong with it,\u0027 I tell them both, \u0027look.\u0027 Harry moves around so that he can see the screen. And now he can see why I\u0027ve been staring. It\u0027s the same thing on every channel. A black screen with stark white text.

Christened “Haters” by the media, the attackers strike without warning and seemingly without reason. Within seconds, normally rational, self-controlled people become frenzied, vicious killers. As the carnage mounts, one thing soon is clear: everyone, irrespective of race, gender, age, or class, has the potential to become either a Hater or a victim. At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent. In the face of this mindless terror, all McCoyne can do is secure his family, seek shelter, and watch as the world falls apart. But when he bolts the front door, the question remains: Is he shutting the danger out or locking it in?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/hater-hater-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:58 AM"}}
