{"id":111957,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Sometimes the thought of work is worse than the reality. All things considered, today at the office was just about bearable. After everything I\u0027d seen and heard over the weekend I\u0027d expected to have to fight my way into work through crowds of people battling with each other on the streets. Apart from a few broken windows and some other slight damage everything looked and felt disappointingly normal. The city centre was quiet for a Monday and the office was too.\n I\u0027m glad to be home. I can see the apartment block at the end of the road now. As usual there are lights on in the diagonally opposite corners of the building - our flat and the other occupied flat upstairs. As I get closer I can see shadows moving around behind our curtains. The kids are running around in the living room. No doubt they\u0027ll have been playing up all evening and I\u0027ll get it in the neck from Liz again.\n We shouldn\u0027t be living in a place like this I think as I walk up the overgrown pathway to the door. I know I\u0027m a lazy sod and I should work harder but it\u0027s not easy. I do my best, it\u0027s just that it doesn\u0027t seem to be enough. I need a kick up the backside from time to time. But if every day could be like today, I decide as I pull open the creaking front door, then maybe things might work out. Today it actually felt like the effort I\u0027d put in had been worthwhile. I didn\u0027t have any screaming members of the public to deal with and I even managed to have a laugh with Tina Murray. Today, for once, I didn\u0027t feel as if I was pulling in the opposite direction to everyone else. The plans that Lizzie and I have been making for years to move to a bigger house, change the car and generally improve our standard of living seem a little more realistic and possible than they did when I left the flat this morning. Still a long way off, mind, but possible.\n I shuffle though the gloom of the lobby and open the door to the flat. I step inside and the warmth of our home makes me realise just how cold it is outside tonight.\n \u0027I\u0027m back,\u0027 I shout as I take off my coat and shoes. It\u0027s unusually quiet in here. I can hear the TV and the children but I can\u0027t hear Liz. She\u0027s usually yelling at one of them. I can\u0027t remember the last time I came home and it was this quiet.\n Edward appears in the hallway in front of me. He\u0027s grinning from ear to ear.\n \u0027Okay, Ed?\u0027\n He nods his head.\n \u0027Had half a day off today,\u0027 he beams, looking pleased with himself.\n \u0027Why, what\u0027s the matter with you?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing. School was shut.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027 I ask again as I walk further into the flat, looking for Liz. I can\u0027t see her in any of the bedrooms.\n \u0027Because of Jack Foster,\u0027 Ed explains. I\u0027m confused.\n \u0027Who\u0027s Jack Foster?\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s in Year Six. You should have seen him, Dad, it was brilliant!\u0027\n I\u0027ve reached the kitchen door. I can see Lizzie in there sitting at the table, drinking a cup of coffee and staring into space.\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 I ask. She looks up, surprised.\n \u0027Didn\u0027t know you were back,\u0027 she says quietly, shaking herself out of her trance. She gets up, walks over to me and hugs me. This sudden display of affection is out of character.\n \u0027What\u0027s that for?\u0027 I whisper, my mouth pressed close to her ear. \u0027You all right?\u0027\n She nods then pushes herself away and goes to fetch my dinner from the oven.\n \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 she sighs. \u0027Had a bad day, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Ed was telling me that the school was closed. Something to do with Jack Foster?\u0027\n She puts my food down on the table and sits in a chair opposite to the place she\u0027s laid for me. I start to eat and watch as she massages her temples. She looks tired and upset. I\u0027m assuming that whatever happened at school today is what\u0027s bothering her.\n \u0027So what happened?\u0027 I ask. She doesn\u0027t want to answer. \u0027Talk to me, Liz...\u0027\n She clears her throat and finishes her coffee. When she finally starts to speak her voice is quiet and full of emotion.\n \u0027Do you know Jack Foster?\u0027\n I shake my head. I\u0027ve heard the name before but I can\u0027t place the face.\n \u0027You know Ben Paris? Short lad with black hair?\u0027\n I\u0027m sure I know who Ben is.\n \u0027His dad\u0027s the hairdresser?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s the one. Jack Foster is his best friend. They\u0027re always hanging around together. We sat next to Jack\u0027s mum Sally at parents evening last term. He\u0027s got a sister in Ed\u0027s class. He\u0027s tall and...\u0027\n \u0027...and he wears glasses?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s him.\u0027\n I\u0027m pretty sure I know who she\u0027s talking about. I say that I do just to keep the conversation moving.\n \u0027So what did he do?\u0027\n Lizzie clears her throat again and composes herself.\n \u0027First thing this morning,\u0027 she begins, \u0027the whole school was in the hall for assembly. The kids were crammed into the middle of the hall and Mrs Shields was parading up and down doing her usual routine at the front.\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t stand that woman,\u0027 I interrupt. Mrs Shields is the headteacher. By all accounts she\u0027s strict and old-fashioned and she speaks to the parents in exactly the same way as she speaks to the kids.\n \u0027I know you don\u0027t like her,\u0027 Liz sighs, \u0027you tell me every time I mention her name. Anyway, she was just finishing off one of her bloody awful bible stories. I was sat at the back next to Denise Jones and...\u0027\n She stops speaking and I stop eating. I look up from my dinner and put down my knife and fork.\n \u0027And...?\u0027\n \u0027Jack\u0027s in Year Six,\u0027 she continues. \u0027The children sit on the floor in age order with the youngest at the front so Jack\u0027s class was at the back of the hall near where we were. Mrs Shields had just asked them to bow their heads for the final prayer before lessons...\u0027\n She stops again.\n \u0027So what happened?\u0027 I press.\n \u0027I was sat there at the back and Jack stood up right in front of me. Most of the children were in front of him and they all had their heads down so there wasn\u0027t much of a reaction at first. Then he just started to run towards Mrs Shields. He was kicking and tripping over the kids and some of them got hurt and started to shout and squeal. By the time everyone had looked up Jack had made it over to the side of the hall. He shoved Eileen Callis off her chair and she ended up flat on her face on the floor. All this happened in seconds. We were all just sat there, too surprised to do anything. Jack grabbed hold of Eileen\u0027s empty chair, lifted it up over his head and ran at Mrs Shields. She moved towards him to try and stop him but he was running at her, swinging the chair round over his head and just missing the kids sitting down at the front. He missed her a couple of times but then he hit her right across her face, just under her eye. Jack\u0027s almost as tall as Mrs Shields. He kept swinging the chair at her and before anyone knew what was happening she was lying flat on the floor with him standing over her, smashing the chair down on her back again and again.\u0027\n \u0027Didn\u0027t anyone stop him?\u0027 I ask.\n \u0027Don Collingwood and Judith Lamb got to him first,\u0027 she answers, nodding. \u0027Don grabbed him and Judith tried to wrestle the chair off him. Bloody hell, Danny, it was like he was possessed or something. It was horrible. Mrs Shields was screaming and that was making some of the kids scream. She was curled up in a ball on the floor next to the piano with her hands over her head. Her hair was all over the place and her glasses were smashed. She had blood running down her face and...\u0027\n \u0027But why?\u0027 I interrupt. \u0027What was the matter with him?\u0027\n She shrugs.\n \u0027Nothing as far as I know. I saw him before school started and he seemed fine. He was having a laugh with his mates. I\u0027ve never known him do anything like this. There are plenty of kids at that school who wouldn\u0027t have surprised me if they\u0027d done it, but not Jack...\u0027\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t make any sense,\u0027 I mumble, my mouth full of food.\n \u0027You\u0027re telling me.\u0027\n \u0027So what did they do with him?\u0027\n She shakes her head.\n \u0027The place went crazy. Don dragged Jack off into one of the offices and locked him in. He trashed the place. He was screaming and shouting and... and God, it was horrible. The poor kid, you could hear him right the way through the school. He sounded terrified.\u0027\n \u0027What about the Head? What about Mrs Shields?\u0027\n \u0027They took her to hospital and had her checked over. I think she was okay, just a few cuts and bruises, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n I turn my attention back to my food for a second but it\u0027s impossible not to keep thinking about what Liz has told me.\n \u0027What made him do it?\u0027 I ask, knowing full well that she won\u0027t be able to answer.\n \u0027No idea,\u0027 she sighs, getting up to make another drink. \u0027Makes you wonder if it\u0027s connected to what we saw over the weekend.\u0027\n \u0027Can\u0027t be,\u0027 I snap instinctively. \u0027This was a kid at a school, how could it be connected?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Anyway, they closed the school not long after it happened and it\u0027s probably going to be closed again tomorrow. We tried to keep the kids distracted but you know what it\u0027s like, Dan, it\u0027s a small school. It\u0027s a close school. Everyone knows everybody else. They had to call the police in to deal with him in the end. Christ, I felt so sorry for Sally. You should have seen her. She looked like she was the one who\u0027d done wrong. And when they took Jack away...\u0027\n \u0027When who took him away?\u0027\n \u0027They took him off in an ambulance in the end. He wouldn\u0027t speak to Sally, wouldn\u0027t even look at her. He was screaming for help. Poor kid had lost it completely. He didn\u0027t have a clue what he was doing. Wouldn\u0027t let anyone near him. It was like he was scared of the rest of us.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-11.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Hater (Hater #1) \n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
