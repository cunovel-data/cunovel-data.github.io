{"id":111981,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"\u0027So how much of it have you worked out then?\u0027 Patrick asks. We\u0027re both upstairs in what was probably destined to be the master bedroom of the half-finished house, sitting with our backs to the recently plastered wall. The sky has cleared now and the moon is providing limited but welcome illumination through the grille over the window. I\u0027m tired and I don\u0027t want to talk but I can\u0027t avoid answering his question.\n \u0027Haven\u0027t got a bloody clue what\u0027s going on,\u0027 I answer honestly. \u0027This is as close as I\u0027ve managed to get,\u0027 I say as I take the folded-up booklet from my bag and pass it to him. He scans the pages by the light of his torch and smiles wryly to himself.\n \u0027Good stuff, this!\u0027 he laughs sarcastically.\n \u0027Took it from a house I hid in,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027Doesn\u0027t say much.\u0027\n \u0027When did you last get anything from the government that did?\u0027\n He shuts the booklet and throws it down onto the bare floorboards.\n \u0027It\u0027s not like there\u0027s anyone you can ask about it, is there?\u0027 I say. \u0027I still don\u0027t know if anyone really knows what\u0027s happening.\u0027\n \u0027Someone knows,\u0027 he mutters, \u0027they must do. You can bet that from the second the first person changed, some government department somewhere has been analysing us and cutting up people like you and me and...\u0027\n \u0027Cutting up people?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m exaggerating,\u0027 he continues, \u0027but you know what I\u0027m saying, don\u0027t you? They\u0027ll have had a team of top scientists sitting in some lab somewhere working out what\u0027s happened to us. They\u0027ll be working on a cure.\u0027\n \u0027You reckon?\u0027\n He shrugs his shoulders.\n \u0027Maybe. Whatever happens they\u0027ll be trying to find a way of stopping us doing what we do.\u0027\n I know he\u0027s right. We\u0027re a threat to them. Far more of a threat than any enemy they might have battled with previously.\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to be cured,\u0027 I say, surprising even myself with my admission. \u0027I want to stay like this. I don\u0027t want to go back to being one of them.\u0027\n Patrick nods and switches off his torch. In the darkness I find myself thinking about Ellis again. I know that it\u0027s only a matter of time before she changes if she hasn\u0027t already. I\u0027ve tried to convince myself that she\u0027ll be all right but I know that as long as she\u0027s with the others she\u0027s in danger. The hardest thing to come to terms with today - harder even than everything I\u0027ve lost - is the fact that Lizzie, the person who carried my little girl and who has provided her with more safety and security than anyone else, is now the one who poses the biggest threat to her. The pain I feel when I think about Ellis tonight is indescribable. Maybe I should try and get to her now. Poor little thing doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen. She hasn\u0027t got a clue...\n \u0027Don\u0027t say a lot, do you?\u0027 Patrick pushes. He\u0027s beginning to get on my nerves but I sense that he has a need to talk. He\u0027s as nervous, scared and confused as I am so I don\u0027t retaliate.\n \u0027Not much to say, is there?\u0027 I grunt back.\n \u0027So who are you thinking about?\u0027\n Very perceptive. I pause but then decide to answer him. Maybe it will help.\n \u0027My little girl. She\u0027s like us.\u0027\n \u0027Why isn\u0027t she with you?\u0027\n \u0027Because of her mother. I was in the house with the whole family when it happened. I knew that Ellis was like me and I tried to get her but...\u0027\n \u0027But what?\u0027\n \u0027Lizzie got to her before me. Smacked me around the face with a bloody metal pipe. Next thing I knew she\u0027d gone and taken all the kids with her.\u0027\n Patrick shakes his head.\n \u0027Too bad,\u0027 he mumbles. \u0027Hurts when you lose them, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027\n I nod, but I don\u0027t know if he notices my response.\n \u0027What about you?\u0027 I ask. \u0027You said something earlier about your partner...\u0027\n He doesn\u0027t answer for a few long seconds.\n \u0027Like I said, I managed to get back home after it happened. You know almost before you see them that they haven\u0027t changed, don\u0027t you? I did what I had to do.\u0027\n I don\u0027t know what he means by that. Did he kill her? I quickly decide that it\u0027s probably not a good idea to ask. For a moment I think that\u0027s the end of the conversation but then Patrick speaks again.\n \u0027Got it all wrong, didn\u0027t they?\u0027 he says.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027The papers and the TV and all that,\u0027 he explains, \u0027made us out to be the villains of the piece, didn\u0027t they?\u0027\n \u0027To them we are.\u0027\n \u0027Made it out to be us that hated them...\u0027\n \u0027I never hated anyone,\u0027 I tell him, \u0027at least not like they said on the news.\u0027\n In the moonlight I watch as Patrick nods knowingly. He\u0027s not stupid. He\u0027s spent the last three days thinking about what I\u0027ve only had a few hours to try and understand.\n \u0027Know what I think?\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 I reply, yawning.\n \u0027They called us the Haters, because from their perspective all we\u0027re doing is attacking and killing. That\u0027s how it looked to me before I changed. You agree?\u0027\n \u0027Suppose.\u0027\n \u0027But the fact of the matter is that everybody hates. They\u0027re just as bad as we are. They want us dead as much as we want to get rid of them. You can feel the hate coming off them, can\u0027t you? Even if they\u0027re not capable of showing it like we are or dealing with it like we do, they want us dead. So all we\u0027re doing is protecting ourselves. You just know that you have to do it, don\u0027t you? You have to kill them before they get to you.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re as bad as each other then,\u0027 I suggest.\n \u0027Maybe. Like I said everybody hates, we\u0027re just better at dealing with it than they are. We have to look after ourselves and if it means destroying them, then that\u0027s what we have to do.\u0027\n \u0027Problem is they feel exactly the same...\u0027\n \u0027I know. But they\u0027re not as physical or aggressive as we are and that\u0027s where we have the advantage. They don\u0027t move quickly enough. They\u0027ll pay the price eventually.\u0027\n \u0027So what is it that\u0027s changed?\u0027 I ask. \u0027And why now? Why has this happened to some of us and not others? Why has it happened at all?\u0027\n \u0027Now that\u0027s the big question, isn\u0027t it? That\u0027s the one I can\u0027t work out the answer to, and you can bet we won\u0027t find any clues in your bloody government brochure either.\u0027\n \u0027But what do you think\u0027s caused it?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve come up with about a hundred possible explanations so far,\u0027 he chuckles, \u0027but they\u0027re all bullshit!\u0027\n \u0027Is it a disease? Have we caught something?\u0027\n He shakes his head.\n \u0027Maybe we have. The way I look at it there\u0027s two possible explanations. Either it is a virus or something like that, or maybe something has happened to everyone. People like you and me have been affected by it, the rest of them haven\u0027t changed at all.\u0027\n \u0027Something like what?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know... maybe someone put something in the water? Perhaps the planet\u0027s drifted through a cloud of bloody space gas or something! Maybe it\u0027s just evolution? Nature taking its course...\u0027\n Patrick chuckles to himself again. The room then becomes silent and the quiet gives me chance to consider what he\u0027s just said. He could be right. If this was a virus or disease, surely more people would have been directly affected? Everything is so screwed up tonight that all of his disjointed and unsubstantiated theories sound plausible.\n \u0027So how many people like us do you think there are?\u0027 I ask, knowing that he can\u0027t do anything other than guess at the answer.\n \u0027No idea,\u0027 he replies. \u0027Last thing I remember hearing they were talking about a small minority of people, and that\u0027s what it says in your booklet here. But I think it\u0027s bigger than anyone\u0027s letting on. Chances are no-one knows how big it is.\u0027\n \u0027And how widespread? Surely this can\u0027t just be happening here?\u0027\n \u0027It spread up and down the country quickly enough, didn\u0027t it? So if one country\u0027s been affected...\u0027\n \u0027...then why not everywhere else?\u0027\n \u0027Exactly.\u0027\n \u0027So where does it end?\u0027\n More silence.\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. Don\u0027t even know if I want to think about it. We have to keep fighting to stay alive, and you can bet they\u0027re going to be doing exactly the same thing. So we can only keep running and keep killing,\u0027 he replies, \u0027because if we don\u0027t get them, they\u0027ll get us.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-36.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Hater (Hater #1) \n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.

At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent.
