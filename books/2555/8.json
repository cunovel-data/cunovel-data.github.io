Poor kid\u0027s obviously been shaken up by what she saw earlier. I\u0027m not surprised, it scared the hell out of me too. Outwardly she doesn\u0027t seem too upset but she won\u0027t stop talking about what happened. You don\u0027t know how kids are affected by seeing things like that. I\u0027ve been sitting on the end of her bed answering a constant stream of questions since she shouted out for me. I\u0027ve done my best but my patience is starting to wear thin. She\u0027s just milking it now, trying to keep me in here as long as she can.\\n\\n \u0027So why were they fighting, Daddy?\u0027 she asks (again).\\n\\n \u0027Ellis,\u0027 I sigh, \u0027I\u0027ve already told you a hundred times, I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have they stopped now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure they have. The police would have stopped them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Would they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s what the police do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did one of the men get hurt?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will he be in hospital now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I answer. I don\u0027t tell her that he\u0027s probably in the hospital morgue.\\n\\n The questions suddenly stop. She\u0027s tired. I can see her eyelids starting to flutter. She\u0027s going to sleep but she\u0027s going to fight it all the way. I should wait until I\u0027m sure she\u0027s gone but I\u0027m desperate to get out of here now. I slide along the bed, get up carefully and then begin to edge towards the door. She stirs and looks up and I freeze.\\n\\n \u0027What about my chips?\u0027 she mumbles, her voice slow and drowsy.\\n\\n \u0027What about them?\u0027 I ask, moving away again.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t finish them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027None of us finished our food. Mummy and Daddy didn\u0027t finish either.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will they still be there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will who still be there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My chips.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I doubt it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Has someone else eaten them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, they\u0027d have gone cold by now. Someone will have thrown them away.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can we go back tomorrow and see?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why not? I want to finish my chips...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ellis,\u0027 I interrupt.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shut up and go to sleep please.\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027ve finally reached the door. I flick the light-switch off and wait for her to react. She doesn\u0027t. The only light in the room now comes in from the hallway. I can still see her shuffling around in bed but I know she\u0027ll be asleep in a few minutes.\\n\\n \u0027Night, Daddy,\u0027 she yawns.\\n\\n \u0027Night, sweetheart.\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027m about to leave when she speaks again.\\n\\n \u0027Is he dead, Daddy?\u0027\\n\\n What do I say to that? Do I tell her the truth or do I lie to save more questions and reassure my little girl? I\u0027m a coward. I sit on the fence.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I mumble quickly. \u0027Goodnight.\u0027\\n\\n I wait for a little while longer until I\u0027m sure she\u0027s asleep. Finally free but exhausted I drag myself down the corridor towards the living room. Halfway through the weekend and I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027ve had any chance to relax yet. There\u0027s a film on tonight that Liz and I wanted to watch. After the last couple of days it will be good just to sit down together and relax for a while.\\n\\n I look around the living room door and see that Lizzie is asleep. She\u0027s sprawled out along the full length of the sofa snoring. I\u0027m disappointed but not surprised. I fetch myself a drink and something to eat from the kitchen before finding somewhere to sit and watch the TV. The other seats are piled high with the children\u0027s toys and clean washing waiting to be put away. I can\u0027t be bothered to move any of it. I sit down on the floor in front of the sofa.\\n\\n Now I can\u0027t find the remote control. I upend most of the washing and turf through the toys but I can\u0027t find the damn thing anywhere. I bet one of the kids has hidden it. Josh has a habit of putting things in the bin. I check through the rubbish then under all the chairs and the sofa. When I\u0027m on the verge of giving up I finally spot the end of it peeking out from underneath Lizzie. She\u0027s fallen asleep on top of it. I pull it out from under her. She grunts and rolls over onto her back but she doesn\u0027t wake up.\\n\\n Just in time. Seconds to spare and I\u0027m finally there. I change the channel and sit back to enjoy the film. Looks like it\u0027s already begun. Actually, it looks like it\u0027s been on for a while. I check the TV listings. Bloody thing started three quarters of an hour ago.\\n\\n Saturday nights are beginning to depress me. For a while now they\u0027ve begun to feel empty and, if I\u0027m honest, pathetic. We\u0027re still young and we should be out enjoying ourselves but we\u0027re not. I always start the weekend with the best of intentions but things never seem to work out how I planned them. Family life gets in the way. I don\u0027t have many close friends to go out with or any spare money, the kids wind us up and wear us out and Lizzie and I are both tired all the time. More often than not I\u0027m left sitting here on my own like this in front of the TV watching pointless drivel. It\u0027s almost midnight now and I\u0027ve wasted hours here on my own. Liz got up and went to bed ages ago.\\n\\n The film I missed was the only thing worth watching tonight. It\u0027s crazy - the more TV channels we get, the fewer programmes worth watching there are. I\u0027ve been sat here with the remote control in my hand constantly flicking through the channels and all I\u0027ve found has been terrible game shows, chat shows with boring guests, pointless reality TV programmes, soap operas, talent competitions, made-for-TV films, repeated dramas and crappy compilations of CCTV footage and home video clips. I\u0027ve ended up watching the news as usual. It\u0027s a rolling twenty-four hour news channel which was interesting for a while but the headlines are on a fifteen minute loop and my eyes are starting to feel heavy now that I\u0027m watching the same thing for the third time. I should go to bed but I can\u0027t be bothered to get up.\\n\\n Hold on a minute. Finally there\u0027s something moderately interesting on screen. A banner saying \u0027Breaking News\u0027 has just appeared and they\u0027ve cut to a reporter standing on a city centre street corner. I recognise where they\u0027re broadcasting from. It\u0027s a place in town, not far from where I work. What\u0027s happened there? I try to read the scrolling text captions at the bottom of the screen but my eyes are tired and the words are moving too quickly. I turn up the volume and listen as a windswept reporter starts talking about something that\u0027s happened at Exodus, one of the trendy bars right in the centre of town. There are people milling around in the street behind him. Christ, someone\u0027s been killed. He\u0027s talking about an attack that happened in the last hour or so. Hold on, no... there have been several attacks. They must have been connected. Sounds like some lunatic has gone on the rampage. Worst time of the week for it to have happened. The middle of town is always heaving with people on Saturday nights. Everyone\u0027s there. Everyone except sad bastards like me, that is, stuck at home with the kids and a partner who\u0027s asleep by half-past nine.\\n\\n I can feel my eyes starting to close again. I try to stay awake and concentrate on what\u0027s being said but it\u0027s difficult. It\u0027s getting late and...\\n\\n That bloody reporter is still talking.\\n\\n I try and focus on the clock on the shelf. I must have nodded off for a few minutes. Hang on, the clock says three-thirty. I\u0027ve been asleep on the floor for hours. No wonder my bones ache. Christ, whatever happened in town tonight must have been pretty serious to warrant this much coverage on national TV. It looks like they\u0027re still broadcasting live from town. I wouldn\u0027t want to have that bloke\u0027s job, stuck out on a street corner for hours on end. Still, at least he gets out...\\n\\n My back hurts. I should have gone to bed hours ago when Lizzie did.\\n\\n I sit up quickly and get ready to move. I hate waking up like this. I feel sick and my arms and legs feel heavy and numb. I get up and I\u0027m about to switch the TV off when something the reporter says makes me stop. He\u0027s not just talking about the same few attacks he was reporting on earlier. Sounds like there\u0027s been more trouble. There\u0027s a map of the city up on the screen now with a load of markers on it. Looks like there\u0027s been a hell of a lot more trouble. That\u0027s the problem with binge drinking and Saturday nights. There are so many people out there and it only takes one idiot to start a fight. Someone gets hurt then someone retaliates, someone else tries to stop them and, before you know it, you\u0027ve got a real problem on your hands. It looks like that\u0027s what\u0027s happened tonight. From what I can gather there was some trouble in a bar which spilled out onto the street. They\u0027re showing footage of crowds of people fighting now, fuelled by drink and drugs. Riot police have been sent to the scene to try and restore some order. Almost makes me glad to be boring and stuck indoors. The map on the screen has been updated now to show the location of four fatalities and more than thirty arrests. It\u0027s always the mindless minority who ruin it for everyone else. Bloody hell, they\u0027ve just said something about the body of a police officer that\u0027s been found with more than forty stab wounds. Christ, what kind of animal could do that to another human being?\\n\\n Wonder how long that reporter\u0027s going to be stuck out there?\\n\\n I\u0027m tired. Before I fall asleep again I switch off the TV and the lights and feel my way through the dark flat to the bedroom.\\n\\n SUNDAY\\n\\n iv\\n\\n Susan Myers woke up next to Charlie, her husband of thirty-three years. She lay in silence in the semi-darkness, taking care not to move. She didn\u0027t want him to know that she was awake. She didn\u0027t want to have to speak to him. Through half-open eyes she watched the curtain as it gusted back and forth in the wind from the vented window, revealing snatched glimpses of the bright world outside. Was there any point in getting up? During the week she managed to fill her time with friends, shopping and social appointments but her weekends, Sundays in particular, were long, bleak and empty. Since Charlie had retired eleven months ago their lives had become increasingly dull and monotonous. Most of her friends had their children and extended families to keep them busy but all she had was him and he bored her. He seemed happy doing nothing but she couldn\u0027t stand it. He wanted to potter around the house and garden, she wanted to be out. She wanted to scream and shout at him and make him understand how she felt but she knew it would be pointless. He didn\u0027t even know she was unhappy.\\n\\n Here we go, she thought as he shuffled and turned over in bed beside her. Maybe - just maybe - he\u0027d roll over to face her this morning and put his arm around her tell her that he loved her and start kissing her and touching her like he used to. It had been so long since they\u0027d made love that she\u0027d almost forgotten what it felt like. And on the very rare occasions she\u0027d managed to get him in the mood (she was always the one who had to make the first move these days) he\u0027d get himself so fired-up and over-excited that their passion, if it could be called that, was generally over and done with in a matter of a few desperately short and empty minutes. If it had been months since they\u0027d made love, it had been years since she\u0027d been satisfied.\\n\\n Maybe she should have an affair? She\u0027d thought about it before but never had the nerve to do it. Charlie probably wouldn\u0027t notice if she did. There was a man at one of the mid-week dancing classes she went to who she\u0027d caught looking in her direction too many times for it to have just been coincidence. The idea of seeing someone else tempted her, but she knew she\u0027d be putting a lot at risk if she ever actually did it. She was worried that she might end up losing everything she\u0027d worked for with Charlie just for a little short-term excitement and adventure. She loved her grand house and her expensive clothes and all the associated trimmings. She loved the elevated social status it gave her and she didn\u0027t want to let any of it go. But what if the man at the dance class could give her all that and sex too...?\\n\\n \u0027Cup of tea?\u0027\\n\\n That was how Charlie started every day. No \u0027good morning\u0027 or \u0027how are you today?\u0027 or \u0027I love you\u0027 or anything like that anymore. Just a short, unemotional, truncated question. Should she answer or should she stay silent and pretend to still be asleep?\\n\\n \u0027Yes please,\u0027 she grunted, still with her back to her husband. She felt him throw back the covers and then slide out of bed before neatly tucking the bedding back into place again as he always did. Everything he did was predictable and safe. She could anticipate every move he was going to make. She knew he\u0027d go to the bathroom next where he\u0027d use the toilet, break wind, apologise to himself and then wash and shave humming the same damn tune he hummed under his breath every bloody morning. Then he\u0027d put on his dressing gown, come back to the bedroom to fetch his slippers from under the foot of the bed where he\u0027d put them last night, and go down to the kitchen. She knew he\u0027d stop on the fifth step down to open the curtains and blow the dust off the top of the employee of the year trophy his employers had awarded him almost fifteen years ago...\\n\\n She screwed her eyes tightly shut, buried her face in the duvet and thought of the man from the dance class again. She felt empty and depressed, trapped and angry. Sometimes she wanted to kill her husband. That, she decided, would be the answer to all her problems.\\n\\n \u0027Lovely day today,\u0027 Charlie said brightly as he returned to the bedroom with two cups of tea.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s always a bloody lovely day,\u0027 Susan silently screamed to herself. \u0027Even when it\u0027s raining and there\u0027s a force ten gale outside he says it\u0027s a bloody lovely day.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here\u0027s your tea, dear.\u0027\\n\\n She cringed under the bedclothes and readied herself to face him. Saddest thing of all, she thought, was that he didn\u0027t have the faintest idea how unhappy she was. In his rose-tinted little world everything was just fine and dandy. He didn\u0027t know how old and worthless he made her feel and he probably never would. She took a deep breath and rolled over onto her back before shuffling up the bed and taking her tea from him.\\n\\n \u0027I had a lousy night\u0027s sleep,\u0027 she complained, looking up at him. \u0027I was freezing cold all night. I kept waking up because you kept pulling the covers off me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry about that, my love. I didn\u0027t realise.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And if it wasn\u0027t the cold keeping me awake it was your snoring.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t help that. If there was something I could do to...\u0027\\n\\n He stopped talking. In silence he stared down at his wife who scowled back at him.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter with you?\u0027 she demanded as she sipped her tea.\\n\\n Charlie continued to stare.\\n\\n \u0027For crying out loud, find something else to look at will you?\u0027 she cursed before taking another sip.\\n\\n With a single sudden swipe Charlie slapped the cup out of his wife\u0027s hands. It smashed against the wall opposite sending countless dribbles of tea dripping down the pale pink anaglypta wallpaper. Bemused, Susan watched the drips of hot brown liquid trickling down the wall. What the hell\u0027s got into him, she wondered? In a bizarre way she was actually excited by this sudden display of unexpected forcefulness and spontaneity.\\n\\n Behind her Charlie quickly yanked the waist belt free from his towelling dressing gown. Shoving her forward and gripping her shoulder tight with one hand he looped the belt twice round her neck in a single spiralling movement and then pulled it tight. Panicking, and with her eyes bulging and throat burning, Susan struggled to breathe. She kicked and squirmed under the bedclothes and scraped at her neck, desperately trying to force her fingers under the belt. Her strength was no match for his.\\n\\n Charlie pulled the belt tighter and tighter until the last breath had been squeezed from his wife\u0027s body. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-8.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
