{"id":111960,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"It\u0027s late by the time we finally get home. We\u0027d expected to be back by five. There were more traffic delays on the way out of town. It\u0027s now almost eight. \u0027Someone\u0027s in a hurry,\u0027 one of the men from the flat upstairs says as we pass him on his way out of the apartment block. I think this is Gary. He has another man with him who I\u0027ve never seen before. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 I mumble as I struggle to get through the entrance door with Josh\u0027s pushchair. \u0027You all right?\u0027 he asks, appearing genuinely concerned. \u0027We\u0027re fine, thanks,\u0027 I answer quickly, not interested in talking. I gently push Lizzie towards the flat. The two men leave. \u0027Everything okay?\u0027 Harry asks as I open our front door. He\u0027s halfway down the hall as soon as he hears the key in the lock. \u0027I\u0027ve been worried sick about you. You could have phoned me again.\u0027 \u0027Sorry, Dad,\u0027 Lizzie says. \u0027There was some trouble,\u0027 I explain. \u0027What kind of trouble?\u0027 Liz takes off her coat and shakes her head. She wipes her eyes. \u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on out there,\u0027 she sighs, her voice quiet and emotional. \u0027It feels like the whole world\u0027s going mad.\u0027 \u0027So what happened?\u0027 he asks, looking from Lizzie to me and then back again for an answer. \u0027Are you both all right? Did you...?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re okay,\u0027 she says wearily as she gently pushes him back down the corridor towards the living room. Josh is still asleep. I carefully unbuckle his straps, take off his coat and pick him up out of the pushchair. \u0027What happened?\u0027 Harry asks again as I follow him and Liz into the living room. I stop and quickly look into the children\u0027s bedrooms. Ed\u0027s lying on his bed reading. Ellis\u0027 room is empty. \u0027We walked down to Pedmore Row to catch the bus,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027Group of blokes came out of nowhere and started kicking hell out of this guy. He was a Hater. Where\u0027s Ellis?\u0027 Harry nods towards the living room. I peer over the back of the sofa and I\u0027m relieved to see her curled up in a ball asleep with her grandad\u0027s jumper draped over her shoulders. She looks peaceful and relaxed. The room is quiet and dark and the only light comes from the flickering TV in the corner. \u0027She wouldn\u0027t go to bed,\u0027 he explains, standing and watching her with me. \u0027Kept asking where you two were. I let her stay with me for a while. I knew she\u0027d fall asleep eventually.\u0027 Liz crouches down in front of Ellis and brushes a strand of hair away from her face. \u0027I\u0027ll take her back to bed,\u0027 she whispers as she carefully slides her arms underneath her and lifts her up. Ellis mumbles and shuffles but she doesn\u0027t wake up. Harry and I watch as she carries her away. Harry then walks around and sits down in the middle of the sofa where he\u0027s probably been sitting all evening. I lay Josh down on my lap. \u0027So tell me again,\u0027 he says quietly, \u0027what exactly did happen?\u0027 I sit down next to him and kick off my shoes. \u0027I don\u0027t know any more than what I\u0027ve already told you. A group of blokes lynched a Hater, that\u0027s all. Evil bastard probably deserved everything he got. Then the bus was late and a road was closed and...\u0027 Harry nods his head, sighs and rubs his eyes. He looks tired. \u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on out there,\u0027 he says quietly. \u0027Anyway, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re back. I had a feeling you might have some trouble tonight.\u0027 I\u0027m about to ask him what he means when he grabs the remote control and turns up the volume on the TV. \u0027Been watching the news since the children\u0027s programmes finished,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Things are getting out of control.\u0027 I turn my attention from Harry to the TV. There\u0027s been no let up in the level of trouble across the country. On the news they\u0027re talking about an \u0027exponential increase in incidents\u0027. Mathematics was never my strongest subject at school but I know what they mean. One incident becomes two, two becomes four, four becomes eight and it goes on and on until... Jesus, where\u0027s this going to end? There\u0027s a definite change in the way the reporters on TV are talking about what\u0027s happening tonight. They\u0027re concentrating on the people - the so-called Haters - who seem to be at the root of all the troubles. They\u0027re stressing that it\u0027s only a very small minority who have been affected but they\u0027re warning the public to stay away from anyone who appears to be behaving erratically. Bloody hell, that\u0027s half the population of this town on a good day. \u0027It\u0027s like a disease,\u0027 Harry says. \u0027Crazy, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s spreading just like a disease.\u0027 \u0027Someone better hurry up and find a cure then,\u0027 I mutter under my breath, still staring at the screen. \u0027They keep saying that all of this is down to just a few people, you know,\u0027 he continues, repeating what I\u0027ve already heard. \u0027When it gets them, whatever it is, it drives them mad. They had some doctor on talking about it earlier. It\u0027s the first few minutes you have to watch out for.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 I mumble, only half-listening. \u0027When it gets them they lose control, like that chap you saw tonight I expect. They just lash out at whoever or whatever\u0027s around them. Then they say they start to calm down. They\u0027re still capable of doing these things, but they\u0027re not quite so volatile.\u0027 What is he talking about? \u0027What do you mean, not quite so volatile?\u0027 I ask him. \u0027Are you saying they\u0027ll only do enough to hospitalise you and not kill you?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m only telling you what I\u0027ve heard,\u0027 he sighs. \u0027I won\u0027t bother if you\u0027re going to be like that.\u0027 I shake my head and look back at the TV. The screen is filled with images of convoys of troops driving into a city centre somewhere. Not sure where it is but it\u0027s nowhere I recognise. The reporters are talking about the police and armed forces being used to full capacity and I think back to the TV debate we watched last night. Have we reached the saturation point they were talking about yet? The voices on the TV are taking great pains to stress that, although stretched, the authorities are still coping. Just. Christ, imagine what will happen if this thing gets any bigger and they can\u0027t cope. Bloody hell, it doesn\u0027t bare thinking about. The screen shows a stream of government statistics and I lose interest. I don\u0027t believe statistics. They\u0027re all made up. They can make statistics say whatever they want. \u0027Problem is,\u0027 Harry says, \u0027they\u0027ve let it get out of control. This is too little, too late.\u0027 \u0027It?\u0027 I say. \u0027What\u0027s \u0027it\u0027 supposed to be?\u0027 He points at the screen. \u0027The trouble,\u0027 he answers, \u0027the violence... the people.\u0027 The statistics have gone and we\u0027re left watching footage of a row of burning houses. Desperate, screaming people are being held back by a police blockade. All they can do is watch as their lives go up in flames. \u0027What\u0027s happening,\u0027 he whispers secretively, \u0027is people are panicking and overreacting to the slightest thing because of what they\u0027re seeing and what they\u0027re being told. The whole situation has been allowed to get out of proportion. People are seeing the death and the destruction on the television and it\u0027s making them want to become a part of it too. It\u0027s like those bloody awful horror films that you and Lizzie watch. They make you want to do things. They put ideas in your head and they make you think it\u0027s all right to do things. They\u0027re even giving these people a label now. Calling them \u0027Haters\u0027 for God\u0027s sake. They\u0027re glamorising it. Almost makes it sound like a club you\u0027d want to join, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 He\u0027s saying the same kind of things I was saying just yesterday. But I\u0027ve already begun to accept that I was wrong, and when I look at the TV screen tonight I\u0027m even more sure that I\u0027d misjudged the situation badly when I was rambling last night. The sheer scale of what\u0027s happening is really beginning to scare me now. They keep talking about small minorities but thousands, possibly even tens of thousands of people are involved in this violence. Hundreds of lives are affected by every incident in some way. Young, old, male, female... people from every section of society are involved. This is far more than just paranoia. This is more than the media stirring things up. \u0027I don\u0027t want to join any club,\u0027 I tell him, \u0027and no-one\u0027s put any ideas in my head. I haven\u0027t started any fights. I\u0027m no more going to go out and attack anyone than you or Lizzie are.\u0027 \u0027I know that. We\u0027ve got maturity and common-sense on our side though, haven\u0027t we? We know the difference between right and wrong. We know what\u0027s acceptable and what isn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Are you trying to say that everyone who\u0027s been affected by this is just immature? Come on, Harry, do you really think...\u0027 \u0027There are plenty of people out there who couldn\u0027t give a damn about right or wrong,\u0027 he continues, ignoring me. \u0027There are people who get a kick out of causing trouble, and putting it on the television like this has just made things worse. By showing it they\u0027re saying it\u0027s all right, that it\u0027s acceptable.\u0027 \u0027Bullshit! They\u0027re not saying that at all...\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re implying that because so many people are involved now, anyone left might as well join in.\u0027 \u0027Bullshit!\u0027 I say again. \u0027There\u0027s no need to swear at me,\u0027 he snaps. \u0027You\u0027re so wrong,\u0027 I try to explain. \u0027It\u0027s got nothing to do with...\u0027 \u0027And that\u0027s just the kind of thing I\u0027m talking about,\u0027 he continues, raising his voice and still not listening to any of what I\u0027m trying to say. \u0027Thirty years ago you\u0027d never have used that kind of language in everyday conversation. Now every other word you hear is a curse. Standards have slipped and that is what\u0027s happening out there on the streets.\u0027 For a moment I can\u0027t answer. The old man has suddenly become very agitated. His face is flushed red with anger and a terrifying thought flashes into my mind. Is he a Hater? Is he about to change? Is he going to become like those people we\u0027ve seen on TV? Is he about to attack me? Should I attack him first before he has chance to get me? Is this how it begins...? \u0027No-one has any respect for anything or anyone else anymore,\u0027 he continues. \u0027It\u0027s a bloody disgrace. It\u0027s been coming for years. Before you know it we\u0027ll have total anarchy and you\u0027ll see...\u0027 \u0027I know what you\u0027re trying to say, Dad,\u0027 Lizzie interrupts, returning to the room, \u0027but I don\u0027t agree. Danny and I had this conversation last night, didn\u0027t we? I\u0027ve never seen anything like the things I\u0027ve seen over the last few days. I\u0027ve seen plenty of trouble before, but never anything like this.\u0027 I relax. Liz\u0027s sudden arrival seems to have calmed the situation. The anger in Harry\u0027s face has gone. \u0027What do you mean? What\u0027s different?\u0027 he asks. Liz stands in the doorway and thinks for a few seconds. \u0027Out there tonight, after they\u0027d beaten that man, you could almost taste it in the air.\u0027 \u0027Taste what?\u0027 I wonder. \u0027The fear,\u0027 she replies. \u0027People are scared. People are already starting to expect trouble and they\u0027re tensing up ready for it. And when it happens they react, most of the time completely out of character from what I\u0027ve seen. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s causing any of this, Dad, but I do know there has to be a definite, physical reason for it. People are bloody frightened and the situation\u0027s getting worse by the day.\u0027 \u0027Things will start to calm down...\u0027 Harry starts to say instinctively. Lizzie\u0027s shaking her head. \u0027No they won\u0027t,\u0027 she says, her voice trembling and unsteady. \u0027We watched a group of men lynch a Hater tonight. I don\u0027t know what he\u0027d done, but it couldn\u0027t have been any worse than the way they retaliated. There was as much hate and anger coming from them as anyone else.\u0027 WEDNESDAY vii Daryl Evans sat at the back of the top floor of the bus as it wound its way through the streets towards the city centre. He leant against the window and looked down as he headed towards the council offices where he worked and yet another day of grind and grief. He didn\u0027t feel like working today. Maybe he\u0027d try and leave after a couple of hours, he thought. Maybe he\u0027d tell Tina, his supervisor, that he didn\u0027t feel well and that he needed to go home. With everything that was happening right now he didn\u0027t think she\u0027d try stopping him. Evans wasn\u0027t particularly interested in the rest of the world. He didn\u0027t pay much attention to anything that happened outside his immediate circle of family and friends. He\u0027d had a good night last night and that made it harder to motivate himself this morning. He\u0027d spent some time with a friend he hadn\u0027t seen for a while. They\u0027d spent the evening drinking beer and eating junk food. He still felt bloated and a little hung-over this morning. He\u0027d slept through his alarm and then turned the flat upside down looking for his watch. He\u0027d eventually found it under his bed but by then he was already late leaving for work. He just knew it was going to be one of those days where everything takes more effort than it should and nothing goes right. Evans didn\u0027t have any time for news and current affairs. He didn\u0027t know why the streets were quiet this morning or why he\u0027d had to wait twice as long as usual for a bus which was half-empty. He did notice that things felt different today, but he really couldn\u0027t be bothered to try and work out why. There were seven other people on the top floor of the bus. Five of them sat alone, quiet and thoughtful, watching the grey and damp morning outside. A couple sat together towards the front, laughing and joking with each other and making more noise than the rest of the passengers combined. Evans sat right at the back and watched them all. The inside of the bus was steaming up with condensation. He wiped the window clean so that he could see how far he\u0027d got left to travel. His sudden movement caught the attention of a pencil-thin, wiry-haired man sitting two rows of seats ahead who nervously turned round to see what was happening behind him. Evans made eye contact with the other passenger and froze. The man - quiet, unassuming and not wanting any trouble - quickly turned back and faced the front of the bus again, praying that nothing was going to happen. It was too late. Evans, filled with a sudden uncontrollable fear and compulsion, jumped up and pulled the other passenger out of his chair. He shoved him down into the aisle between the two rows of seats and he landed with a heavy thump which was loud enough to be heard by everyone on the lower floor. He looked down at the man who stared back up at him petrified, his shoulders wedged between the seats on either side. Evans raised his foot and stamped on his face, breaking his nose and splitting the skin under his right eye. Then he stamped again, then again and again, feeling any resistance almost immediately fade and then feeling the man\u0027s bones beginning to crack beneath the force of his relentless attack. The driver looked up in her monitor but the rush of top floor passengers getting up from their seats and running down the steep staircase blocked her view. She brought her bus to a sudden halt in the middle of a usually busy dual carriageway road. A week ago many people would have tried to do something to help, but not today. Terrified and fearing for their own safety they ran as quickly as they could, spilling out onto the street and looking up at the occasional flashes of movement they could see from the bloody and violent attack which continued on the top floor. Two police officers who had been patrolling nearby were inside the bus before the last passengers had scrambled out. They climbed the stairs at speed, batons raised and ready. Daryl Evans threw himself at them. A single well-aimed smash of a truncheon across the side of his head knocked him out cold and he collapsed to the ground, falling just inches away from the lifeless feet of the body of the man he\u0027d just beaten to death.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-14.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
