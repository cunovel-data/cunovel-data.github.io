I\u0027ve slept for little more than an hour but I feel as refreshed as if I\u0027ve slept all night. I look up at the canopy of leaves and twisted branches above my head. A familiar face stares back at me.\n \u0027Thought it was you,\u0027 says Patrick. \u0027You managed to get away then.\u0027\n I sit up quickly. He reaches out his hand and I shake it. I look around and see that many more people have arrived here while I\u0027ve been asleep.\n \u0027You okay,\u0027 I ask as I stand up and stretch.\n \u0027Absolutely bloody brilliant,\u0027 he replies, grinning from ear to ear. \u0027You?\u0027\n I think before answering. In less than twenty-four hours I\u0027ve lost everything that used to matter to me. I should feel battered, devastated and empty but I don\u0027t. I echo Patrick\u0027s sentiment. I feel incredible. I feel alive. My body is full of energy and strength. My mind is clear. I\u0027m ready to do what I have to do.\n \u0027Never felt like this before,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027I\u0027ve never felt this good.\u0027\n It isn\u0027t long before we move on. The scouts who brought us to this place tell us that there\u0027s a small town on the other side of this valley. We\u0027ll start there. I know exactly what I have to do. I\u0027m ready now to go into the streets and destroy as many of them as I can find. This battle is only just beginning.\n We leave the trees at the bottom of the valley and emerge into a clear and dry morning. The sun is just beginning to rise and I can already hear the sounds of fighting drifting on the breeze. There\u0027s a hint of smoke in the air - the smell of their world being torn apart.\n Christ I feel strong. I know now that I\u0027ve finally thrown off the shackles and restraints of the life I used to lead and I\u0027m free to follow my instincts and do what I was born to do. For the first time since I left her I can think of Ellis this morning and not feel any pain. I know that my little girl is out there somewhere, killing for us. I hope I\u0027ll find her again one day. I\u0027ll tell her how proud I am.\n We move as a pack, powering up the side of the steep hill which looms ahead of us. We reach the top of the climb and I\u0027m barely out of breath. I stand next to Patrick and together we look down onto a truly beautiful scene. In the distance we can see the town, and it is burning. There are already battles raging in the streets. Explosions rock buildings and reduce them to rubble. People are running, fighting and killing.\n It\u0027s awe-inspiring.\n Patrick grins like a child on Christmas morning.\n The sun bathes the scene with brilliant, golden light and I can see for miles in every direction. People are swarming towards the town from all sides. With excitement burning in my gut I start to run towards the buildings, desperate to get there, desperate to fight and kill.\n We thunder down the other side of the hill, sprint diagonally across a wide and uneven field and then reach the main road into the town. With two others I break into the first building we reach. We smash the front windows of the small, square house and climb in. I find the two elderly occupants upstairs, cowering pathetically in a bedroom. One of them hides under the bed. I grab its foot, drag it out, stand it upright and smash its face into the wall. There\u0027s another in the wardrobe. It tries to stay silent but I can hear its unsteady breathing and pitiful whimpering. I pull the doors open, throw it across the room and watch in satisfaction as the other two who are in here with me tear it limb from limb.\n By the time we get back outside our bloody attack has been replayed numerous times in numerous houses. Without pausing for breath I run on, desperate to find more of them to destroy.\n This is a perfect day.\n After so much uncertainty, fear and pain, everything is clear. Everything finally makes sense.\n We are at war.\n THE END \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-45.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Hater (Hater #1) \n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
