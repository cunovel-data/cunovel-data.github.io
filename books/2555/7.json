{"id":111954,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u0027We\u0027re going to be late,\u0027 Lizzie grumbles. I know we are, but there\u0027s not a lot I can do about it. If she\u0027d given me more notice that we were supposed to be taking Edward to a friend\u0027s birthday party then we would have been fine. Half an hour to get the kids ready and out isn\u0027t enough. Part of me wishes she\u0027d forgotten about it for another hour. I want Ed to have a good time and enjoy himself of course I do, but I\u0027m not looking forward to spending the next couple of hours sitting in a kid-friendly and adult-unfriendly \u0027fun-barn\u0027 attached to the side of a pub. It\u0027s not how I\u0027d planned to spend my Saturday afternoon.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll get there when we get there,\u0027 I tell her. \u0027Getting wound up about it isn\u0027t going to help.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not wound up,\u0027 she snaps, proving that she is. \u0027I just don\u0027t like being late, that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We won\u0027t be late. We\u0027ve got a few minutes yet. The pub\u0027s only round the corner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know but look at the traffic.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s probably been an accident or something,\u0027 I tell her, sitting up in my seat and craning my neck to try and see further down the road. \u0027I think there\u0027s something going on at the top of the hill. Once we get past that the traffic will clear.\u0027\\n\\n I hear a muffled thump and a yelp from behind me. I glance over my shoulder and glare at the kids who are crammed shoulder to shoulder on the back seat. They hate being in the car nearly as much as I do. It\u0027s too small for us all to fit in but what can I do? I can\u0027t afford to change it so they\u0027ll just have to put up with it for now. We all will. Lizzie looks at them and then leans closer to me.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re going to have to feed them,\u0027 she whispers, keeping her voice low so they don\u0027t hear.\\n\\n \u0027Ed will eat at the party, won\u0027t he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll get the other two a packet of crisps or something,\u0027 I say quickly before she gets any ideas. I think I know where this is heading.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ll need more than that,\u0027 she says. \u0027We\u0027re going to be out for a couple of hours. Why don\u0027t we just make it easy for ourselves and have a meal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because we can\u0027t afford it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on, Danny, we might as well. We\u0027re going to be sat in the pub anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t afford it,\u0027 I say again. How much clearer do I need to make it? \u0027Look, we\u0027ll drop Ed off then go back home and have some dinner. I\u0027ll come back and pick him up again after the party.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is it worth all the hassle and the extra petrol? Let\u0027s just stop and have a meal and we can...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t afford it,\u0027 I snap for the third time as we reach the top of the hill and pass whatever it is that\u0027s been slowing down the traffic. I look into the rear view mirror and see that the kids are pressing their faces against the glass, trying to see what\u0027s going on. \u0027Don\u0027t stare,\u0027 I shout at them. I can\u0027t help but look myself. Looks like the police have sealed off the entrance to one of the roads which leads off Maple Street.\\n\\n \u0027Twenty quid,\u0027 Lizzie continues. Bloody hell, she\u0027s not going to give up. \u0027Are you telling me you can\u0027t find twenty quid to feed your family?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I answer, trying hard not to get annoyed, \u0027that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m telling you.\u0027 I\u0027m determined she\u0027s not going to get the better of me today, no matter how hard she tries. \u0027I haven\u0027t got twenty quid and even if I had, why should I spend it on a meal when we\u0027ve got a freezer full of food at home? At home we can eat twice as much for half the cost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When was the last time we ate out?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When was the last time I had enough money to take us out?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on, Danny...\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027m not even going to answer. I\u0027ll keep my mouth shut and concentrate on driving. She does this to me too often. She\u0027s like a dog with a bone. She won\u0027t let go. She just keeps nagging and piling on the pressure until I relent just to shut her up.\\n\\n Not today.\\n\\n I caved in. I\u0027m disappointed with myself but it was inevitable. She just wouldn\u0027t stop. She kept on and on at me all the way here. I figured I could either relent and take the hit to my wallet or I could stand my ground and risk a whole weekend of grief and her not talking to me. When I walked into the pub and smelled the food and looked at the menu my resistance crumbled. Pathetic really.\\n\\n We\u0027ve been waiting for our dinner for almost half an hour now and I\u0027m starting to think they might have forgotten our order. We\u0027re tucked out of the way in a corner of the main dining area and the place is heaving. It\u0027s Saturday lunchtime so I expected it to be busy but not like this. The long, horseshoe-shaped bar is surrounded by a crowd of bodies several drinkers deep. I should have seen it coming really. There\u0027s a football match on this afternoon. It\u0027s a local derby between two teams at the bottom of the table and there\u0027s a lot at stake for both sides. The ground the match is being played at is only fifteen minutes walk from here. Most of the people crammed in here seem to be supporters enjoying their traditional pre-match drinking session. I bet the place will empty after kick-off but we\u0027ll be long gone by then. The supporters from both sides seem to be tolerating each other but the noise in here is deafening and I feel uneasy. Maybe I\u0027m just on edge after what happened at the concert last night. I\u0027m worried that there\u0027s going to be trouble. Lizzie\u0027s thinking the same thing, I can see it in her face. She keeps looking around the crowd and frowning. She\u0027s noticed that I\u0027m looking at her now and her expression has suddenly changed.\\n\\n \u0027Okay?\u0027 she asks, trying to sound relaxed and happy but failing to convince me.\\n\\n \u0027Great,\u0027 I grunt. \u0027No food yet and I can\u0027t hear myself think.\u0027\\n\\n Ellis reaches across the table and tugs at my sleeve.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t do that,\u0027 I snap.\\n\\n \u0027When\u0027s dinner coming?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When it\u0027s ready.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When will that be?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just be patient,\u0027 Liz tells her. \u0027As soon as they\u0027ve cooked it someone will bring it over to us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I want it now,\u0027 she states, not interested in any excuses or explanations. \u0027I\u0027m hungry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re all hungry, love. As soon as it\u0027s ready they\u0027ll bring it over to us and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Want it now,\u0027 she says again.\\n\\n \u0027Did you hear what Mum just said?\u0027 I hiss at her, my patience rapidly wearing thin. \u0027Just shut up and wait. Your dinner will be here when...\u0027\\n\\n I stop talking. Smashing glass. There\u0027s a sudden roar of noise from deep within the crowd around the bar. I stare into the mass of faded denim and football shirts looking for trouble. I can\u0027t see anything. I\u0027m relieved when I can hear laughs and jeers amongst the noise.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s up?\u0027 Lizzie asks me.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 I answer. \u0027Can\u0027t see anything...\u0027\\n\\n A very drunk, beer-soaked football fan staggers past our table on the way to the toilet. A member of the bar staff carrying a dustpan and brush passes them going the other way. Looks like it was a spilled drink, nothing more serious.\\n\\n Our food finally arrives. My mouth starts watering and my stomach is growling but I can\u0027t eat yet. Another one of the joys of parenthood. Josh is sitting next to me and I now have to go through the well-rehearsed routine of cutting up his dinner and smothering it in tomato sauce before I can start mine. Both Liz and Ellis are well into their meals by the time I finally manage to pick up my knife and fork.\\n\\n \u0027Is it all right?\u0027 she asks me before I\u0027ve finished my first mouthful. Christ, give me a second to taste it first.\\n\\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 I answer. \u0027Yours?\u0027\\n\\n She nods and chews.\\n\\n For a blissful minute or two the table is quiet. The rest of the pub is still filled with noise but with everyone temporarily distracted by their food there\u0027s a welcome pause in our conversation. It doesn\u0027t last long.\\n\\n \u0027I want to go and see Dad tomorrow,\u0027 Lizzie says. \u0027That all right with you?\u0027 I nod my head as I eat. I\u0027m not surprised. We seem to end up over at Harry\u0027s house most Sunday afternoons. We see him virtually every day now since he agreed to look after Josh so that Liz can go to work. She\u0027s a classroom assistant at the school Ed and Ellis go to. Harry\u0027s not happy about it but he does it because he knows how much we need the money.\\n\\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 I answer, finally swallowing my food, \u0027we\u0027ll go over in the afternoon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s been really good to us recently,\u0027 she continues. \u0027I don\u0027t want him to think that we\u0027re just going to keep taking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like your sister does?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Leave Dawn alone. She\u0027s been struggling since Mark left.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Best move that bloke ever made,\u0027 I say, perhaps unfairly. \u0027She struggled when they were together. She\u0027ll struggle whatever happens.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on, don\u0027t be unkind. It\u0027s not easy for her being on her own with the kids. I don\u0027t know how I\u0027d cope.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027d just get on with it. You\u0027d find a way of getting by, we both would. The problem is your sister is too quick to look for the easy option all the time. What she needs is someone to...\u0027\\n\\n A sudden, unexpected and very loud clattering noise interrupts me. It\u0027s Josh. He\u0027s dropped his fork on the floor. I bend down and pick it up before cleaning it on a paper napkin and passing it back to him.\\n\\n \u0027What she needs,\u0027 Lizzie continues, taking over where I left off, \u0027is some space and more time to try and come to terms with what happened and what he did. She didn\u0027t deserve any of it. You can\u0027t do that to someone and then just expect them to...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not saying she deserved anything, I just think that...\u0027\\n\\n Another clatter of metal on floor tile. I pick up Josh\u0027s fork for the second time, clean it and pass it back. He grins at me.\\n\\n \u0027All I\u0027m saying is that...\u0027\\n\\n Josh drops his fork again. Now I\u0027m really starting to lose my patience. I pick it up, clean it and slam it down on the table next to his plate. He squeals with laughter. Irritating little sod.\\n\\n \u0027Do that again and we\u0027re going home,\u0027 I threaten.\\n\\n \u0027Just ignore him,\u0027 Lizzie says, still managing to eat her food. I\u0027ve hardly touched mine. \u0027He\u0027s only doing it because he\u0027s getting a reaction from you. The more you react, the more he\u0027ll do it.\u0027\\n\\n I know she\u0027s right but it\u0027s hard to keep calm. I try and concentrate on my dinner but I can feel Josh staring at me, desperate to make eye contact. I cringe as the fork hits the ground again. I know I shouldn\u0027t but I can\u0027t stop myself from reacting. I grab the fork off the floor and hold it in front of him, just out of his reach.\\n\\n \u0027Fork...\u0027 he whines.\\n\\n \u0027Danny...\u0027 Lizzie warns.\\n\\n \u0027Do you want to go home?\u0027 I hiss at him through clenched teeth. \u0027Or do you want to finish your dinner first? If you do that again we\u0027re going.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Daddy might buy you an ice-cream if you finish your dinner,\u0027 Liz says.\\n\\n \u0027I might not,\u0027 I add quickly. \u0027Bloody hell, I\u0027ve spent enough already. I can\u0027t afford to keep...\u0027\\n\\n There\u0027s another interruption from the crowd of football supporters. I wish they\u0027d shut up, selfish bastards. More noise. Nervous, uncertain noise. This doesn\u0027t sound good. No-one\u0027s laughing this time. I turn round just in time to see a section of the crowd part as a squat, bald-headed and tattoo-covered man is charged across the room by another fan who seems to be about twice his height but half his weight. They\u0027ve smashed into a table where another family was eating. People are up off their chairs and are scattering in all directions.\\n\\n \u0027What are they doing?\u0027 Ellis asks innocently. \u0027Are they playing or fighting?\u0027\\n\\n The two men are stood up again now and I\u0027m praying they don\u0027t come any nearer. The thinner man holds the tattooed man by his jacket and he\u0027s swinging him around. He tries to grab hold of something to steady himself but the thin man\u0027s not giving him a chance. He lets him go and then runs at him and shoves him in the chest, sending him tripping backwards. Another hard shove and this time the tattooed man is pushed so far that he ends up flat on his back on another table not far from where we\u0027re sitting. Half-empty plates, cutlery and glasses are sent flying. I grab hold of Josh and I look around and see that Lizzie has done the same with Ellis. The clattering, crashing and smashing noise quickly fades away and is replaced by a heavy and uncomfortable silence. Everyone is watching the fight but it\u0027s so sudden and so violent that no-one dares to get involved. Everyone knows they should do something but no-one\u0027s moving.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t, mate...\u0027 the man lying on his back on the table cries nervously. \u0027Please don\u0027t...\u0027\\n\\n The thin man looks around. Holding his victim down with one hand he searches through the debris on the table and picks something up. It\u0027s only when he holds it up above his head that I see he\u0027s got a steak knife. The next few seconds seem to last forever. I don\u0027t want to watch but I can\u0027t look away. He brings the knife thumping down on the tattooed man\u0027s chest and sinks it into his flesh. But that\u0027s not enough. His fist already covered in blood he yanks the blade out then stabs it down again and again and again...\\n\\n Fucking hell.\\n\\n Christ, we have to get out of here. We have to move. This bloke\u0027s out of his mind. What if he turns on the rest of us? The hundreds of people crammed into this overcrowded pub have started to panic and are heading for the exits, running from the two men in the middle of the room. The thin man is still shredding the other man\u0027s chest with the sharp, serrated blade. The tattooed man\u0027s arms and legs are thrashing and even from this distance I can see that the table and both men are covered in blood.\\n\\n I drag Josh out of his chair and then push Lizzie towards the nearest door. I\u0027m trying hard to stay calm but I\u0027m fucking terrified. Come on, get a fucking move on... There\u0027s a crowd of drinkers all trying to push their way out through a narrow doorway at the same time and, for the second time in less than a day I\u0027m stuck at the back of a load of people trying to get away from trouble. I hold Josh close to my chest and look over my shoulder to see where the lunatic with the knife is. If he\u0027s finished with the man on the table who knows who he\u0027s going to come after next. I don\u0027t want to be his next victim. I just want to...\\n\\n \u0027Danny!\u0027 I hear Liz scream. I look up again. She\u0027s been pulled further along with the crowd and there are a couple of meters between us now. She\u0027s almost through the door. She\u0027s looking back and shouting something at me. I can\u0027t make it out.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ed,\u0027 she yells, \u0027get Ed!\u0027\\n\\n Jesus Christ. There\u0027s no time to think. I hold on to Josh tightly and make a sudden change in direction back towards the fun-barn. The way through is clear. The people in there can\u0027t have heard what\u0027s happening yet. I push through the swinging double-doors and look around for Ed but I can\u0027t see him. The lighting is low at this end of the room and there are kids and their parents everywhere.\\n\\n \u0027Edward!\u0027 I shout over thumping party music. People turn and look at me like I\u0027ve gone mad. \u0027Ed!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dad!\u0027 I hear him shout back. I can see him now, down by one of the climbing frames at the far end of the room with a friend. I run towards him.\\n\\n \u0027Get your shoes and your coat,\u0027 I tell him, \u0027we\u0027ve got to go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But Dad,\u0027 he starts to protest.\\n\\n \u0027Get your shoes and your coat,\u0027 I tell him again.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 someone asks. I turn round and see that it\u0027s Wendy Parish, the mother of one of Ed\u0027s friends.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s some trouble in the pub,\u0027 I tell her, watching anxiously as Ed disappears to find his stuff. \u0027I\u0027d get out of here if I was you. I\u0027d get everyone out of here.\u0027\\n\\n I look up and see that staff from the pub have reached the staff of the fun-barn and they look about to make a tannoy announcement to clear the building. Ed\u0027s back with his coat on. He sits down and starts putting on his shoes.\\n\\n \u0027Come on, son,\u0027 I yell over the noise. \u0027Do that outside.\u0027\\n\\n Confused, he jumps up and holds onto me as we run towards the exit, weaving around the suddenly scattered tables and chairs. We push our way out into the car park and I can see Liz and Ellis standing over by the car. I run towards them. Ed hobbles along beside me, one shoe on and one shoe off. I can hear sirens approaching.\\n\\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 Liz asks.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re fine,\u0027 I answer, rummaging through my pockets for the keys. I open the door and between us we bundle the children inside. I gesture for her to get in and she does. I finish strapping Josh into his car seat and then get into the front and lock the door.\\n\\n \u0027Should we wait for the police?\u0027 Liz wonders, her voice little more than a whisper.\\n\\n \u0027Bollocks to that,\u0027 I answer as I start the engine and reverse quickly out of the parking bay. Cars are already queuing up to get out of the car park. \u0027No-one else is stopping,\u0027 I say as we join the back of the queue. \u0027Let\u0027s just get out of here.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-7.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
