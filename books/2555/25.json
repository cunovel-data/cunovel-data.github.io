{"id":111970,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"\u0027Dad,\u0027 Ed says.\n \u0027What?\u0027 I grunt, annoyed that I\u0027ve been interrupted. I\u0027ve been reading through a pile of music magazines I found under the bed. I thought I\u0027d thrown these out years ago. They\u0027ve helped me get through the uneasy boredom of this never-ending afternoon.\n \u0027What\u0027s he doing?\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s who doing?\u0027 I ask, not lifting my head.\n \u0027That man from the house down the road. What\u0027s he doing?\u0027\n \u0027What man?\u0027\n \u0027Jesus Christ,\u0027 Lizzie screams as she walks into the room. The panic in her voice makes me drop my magazine and look up. Fucking hell, the man who lives in one of the houses adjacent to our apartment block is dragging his wife out of their house and into the middle of the street. She\u0027s a huge woman with a wide backside and flabby arms which are thrashing about wildly. The man - I think his name is Woods - is pulling her along by her feet and I can hear her screaming from here. He drags her down the kerb and her head cracks back against the road. He\u0027s carrying something else with him. I can\u0027t see what it is...\n \u0027What\u0027s he doing?\u0027 Ed asks again.\n \u0027Don\u0027t look,\u0027 Liz yells at him. She rushes across the room and tries to turn Ed around and push him towards the door. Josh is in the way. He\u0027s standing in the doorway eating a biscuit and Lizzie can\u0027t get past.\n \u0027Don\u0027t look at what?\u0027 Ellis asks. I didn\u0027t see her come in. She\u0027s behind me, standing on tiptoes and looking out of the window.\n \u0027Do what Mum says,\u0027 I say as I try to pull her away. She clings onto the windowsill and won\u0027t let go. The children have been going stir crazy trapped in the house. They\u0027re desperate for any distraction.\n Outside Woods has stopped moving now. His wife is still lying on the ground and he\u0027s standing on her neck. Bloody hell, he\u0027s put his boot and his full weight on her throat. Her face is blood red and she\u0027s thrashing about more than ever but he\u0027s managing to keep her down even though he\u0027s half her size.\n \u0027Ellis, let go,\u0027 I shout as I finally manage to prise her away from the window. Ed is still watching and I can\u0027t help staring either. I can\u0027t look away. It was a bottle that Woods was carrying. He\u0027s unscrewed the lid now and he\u0027s emptying the contents all over his wife. What the hell is he doing?\n \u0027What\u0027s happening?\u0027 Harry asks. Now we\u0027re all in the living room. He\u0027s between me and the door and I have to move round him to get Ellis out. I try to close the curtains again but I can\u0027t reach from here. Harry\u0027s in the way.\n \u0027Get the children out of here,\u0027 Lizzie screams.\n \u0027Will you move, Harry?\u0027 I snap. \u0027I can\u0027t get through...\u0027\n I look out of the window again as Woods sets fire to his wife. Christ knows what he just doused her in but she\u0027s gone up in a huge ball of flames and the fire has caught him too. She\u0027s still moving. Bloody hell. I put my hands over Ellis\u0027 eyes but I\u0027m slow to react and she\u0027s already seen too much. Woods trips away from the burning body, his trouser legs on fire. He staggers down Calder Grove but only makes it halfway down the road before he\u0027s consumed by the flames.\n Between us we push the kids out into the hall. I go back to the living room.\n Outside no-one does anything. No-one moves. There\u0027s no activity out on the street, not even when the fire from Woods\u0027 wife\u0027s burning body spreads and sets light to a pile of plastic sacks filled with rubbish which have been sat at the side of the road for more than a week. Thick black smoke billows up from the bags and from the corpses in the road, filling the air with dirty fumes.\n Sobbing, Lizzie pulls the curtains shut.\n The man on the landing at the top of the stairs is dead. I crept out of the flat a few minutes ago and went up to check. What a fucking horrible way to go - ending your days slowly bleeding to death on your own at the top of a dark, concrete staircase. Could I have done anything for him? Possibly. Should I have done anything for him? Definitely not. He was a Hater, and its scum like him that have caused all of this. They\u0027re the reason everything is falling apart. They\u0027re the reason I\u0027ve had to lock myself and my family in the flat. They\u0027re the reason we\u0027re all fucking terrified.\n What scares me most about the body upstairs and what we saw on the street is the closeness of it all. I could cope with this crisis when it was just something on the news. I could even deal with it at the concert and when we saw the fight in the pub and the kid under the car. What\u0027s changed today is the proximity of the trouble to my children and my home. This flat felt safe until today. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-25.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Hater (Hater #1) \n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults. Christened “Haters” by the media, the attackers strike without warning and seemingly without reason. Within seconds, normally rational, self-controlled people become frenzied, vicious killers. As the carnage mounts, one thing soon is clear: everyone, irrespective of race, gender, age, or class, has the potential to become either a Hater or a victim. At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent. In the face of this mindless terror, all McCoyne can do is secure his family, seek shelter, and watch as the world falls apart. But when he bolts the front door, the question remains: Is he shutting the danger out or locking it in?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/hater-hater-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:58 AM"}}
