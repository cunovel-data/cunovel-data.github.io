{"id":111972,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"It\u0027s just before midnight. The children are asleep. We\u0027re sitting in the living room in silence and in almost total darkness. Harry, Liz and I couldn\u0027t be sitting any further apart from each other in here. Harry\u0027s opposite the window, looking out through half-drawn curtains. Liz is by the door, staring into space. The television has been off all night. No-one\u0027s saying anything new so there\u0027s no point watching. The lack of information is just making things worse.\\n\\n \u0027Anyone want a drink?\u0027 I offer. This silence is unbearable.\\n\\n \u0027Not for me,\u0027 answers Harry. I look over at Lizzie. She shakes her head and looks down. She hasn\u0027t spoken for hours. We had a conversation about the kids just after they\u0027d gone to bed but since then she\u0027s hardly said anything.\\n\\n The room is filled with dull, rumbling noise and a sudden flash of light as a huge ball of flame mushrooms up into the sky from a building nearby.\\n\\n \u0027What in hell\u0027s name was that?\u0027 Harry grumbles as he gets up from his chair and staggers to the window. He pulls the curtains fully open and I stand behind him and look over his shoulder. I can\u0027t see what\u0027s burning. It looks like it might be the medical centre on Colville Way. It\u0027s about quarter a mile away from here but that\u0027s too close for comfort. As the initial noise and burst of flame dies down I hear other, equally frightening sounds. A desperate woman yells out for help. Her voice is hoarse and terrified. She\u0027s pleading with someone, screaming at them to get away from her and leave her alone and... and her cries suddenly stop. Now I can hear a car starting. The engine is revved and accelerated furiously. The car begins to move at speed but its brief journey is over in seconds. Brakes squeal and tyres skid across the road before I hear the unmistakable thump and crunch of a collision.\\n\\n The quiet which follows the sudden mayhem is a thousand times worse than the flames and the screams. I\u0027m standing here waiting to hear sirens as the police, fire brigade or anyone who can help reaches the scene but there\u0027s nothing, just a cold and empty silence. I know that the response would be the same if anything happened here. We\u0027re completely on our own.\\n\\n I turn around. The room is still filled with dull light from the fire and I can see that Lizzie\u0027s crying. I sit down next to her leaving Harry at the window watching the inferno in the near distance. I put my arm around her and pull her closer.\\n\\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 I say uselessly. She doesn\u0027t react. I reach out and hold her hand but it just sits limply in mine.\\n\\n \u0027It should never have got to this stage,\u0027 Harry chunters with his back to us, standing at the window like a general surveying the battlefield. \u0027They should never have let it come to this.\u0027\\n\\n He turns round and stares at us both, seeming to be almost demanding a response. Liz stares back at him, her face streaked with tears.\\n\\n \u0027Leave it, Harry,\u0027 I warn him. \u0027This isn\u0027t the time...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When is the time then?\u0027 he snaps. \u0027When do you want to start talking about it? When the trouble reaches your front door?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a body in the street about ten meters away. I\u0027d say it\u0027s reached the front door already,\u0027 I snap back angrily.\\n\\n \u0027So what are we going to do about it?\u0027 he demands. There\u0027s an uncomfortable hint of panic and desperation in his raised voice. \u0027Are we just going to sit here? Are we just going to...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What can we do?\u0027 I interrupt, holding Lizzie\u0027s hand a little tighter. \u0027What are the options, Harry? Should we sit here and keep ourselves and the children safe, or do you want us to go out there and join in the fighting?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what caused the problems in the first place,\u0027 he argues.\\n\\n \u0027Exactly, so what else are we supposed to do?\u0027\\n\\n Harry is pointing his finger at me now and his voice is getting louder. He\u0027s not making any sense and I\u0027m biting my lip, trying not to panic. Once again I find myself wondering if he\u0027s about to turn.\\n\\n \u0027This is just what people have been waiting for,\u0027 he continues at an uncomfortable volume, \u0027an excuse to fight. Not that they\u0027ve needed much of an excuse before, but now it doesn\u0027t matter. People can do what the bloody hell they like without fear of any repercussions. It\u0027s a chance for the scum around here to show their true colours and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shut up,\u0027 Lizzie yells angrily. \u0027Just shut up, Dad. You\u0027re not helping.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027These people need a firm hand,\u0027 he rants, oblivious. He points accusingly at the TV. \u0027And if the idiots running the television stations hadn\u0027t sensationalised things by showing more and more violence then maybe we wouldn\u0027t be in this mess. If there had just been some respect for authority maybe we\u0027d all be...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There is no authority any more,\u0027 I shout back. \u0027I saw a policeman shooting people in cold blood yesterday and then I watched other officers turn their weapons on him and gun him down. The authorities are as screwed as the rest of us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But if people would just stop...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake, shut up!\u0027 Liz screams again. She snatches her hand from mine and storms out of the room. I watch her disappear down the hallway and almost immediately the paranoia begins. Harry is quiet now - is it Liz who\u0027s turning? Is she heading for the kids\u0027 rooms? Is she going to hurt them? I get up and run after her. I\u0027m relieved when I find that she\u0027s shut herself in the bathroom and I feel stupid and guilty for thinking she could have been doing anything else. I slowly trudge back to the living room where Harry finally seems to be calming down.\\n\\n \u0027She all right?\u0027 he grunts.\\n\\n I nod but I can\u0027t bring myself to speak to him. He turns his back on me again and continues to watch the smoke rising from the building burning on Colville way. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-27.html","bookId":2555,"book":{"id":2555,"title":"Hater (Hater #1)","description":"Storyline: Hater (Hater #1) \\n A modern take on the classic “apocalyptic” novel, Hater tells the story of Danny McCoyne, an everyman forced to contend with a world gone mad, as society is rocked by a sudden increase in violent assaults.
