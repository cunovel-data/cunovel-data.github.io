Her boring life is suddenly turned on its head when she’s rudely kidnapped from her bedroom. Or so she thinks. Nox Taylor is far too high up in his field to be assigned a babysitting job. There’s nothing more he wants than to complete his mission so he can be rid of the smartass tomboy, Lily. Day after day, Nox watches Lily and her strange ways. She’s unlike any woman he’s ever met. Getting close to the girl is purely for her own protection…right? Lily never imagined she’d make her first real friends in captivity. What lengths would she go through to keep them?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/willing-captive.jpg","author":"Belle Aurora","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":29,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
