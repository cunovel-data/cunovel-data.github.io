And honestly, I’m more hurt about Tori than I am about what happened with Hunter. I’m mostly just pissed at Hunter.\n Ridge: Yeah, I don’t even know the guy, and I’ve been pretty pissed at him. I can’t imagine how you must feel. I’m surprised you haven’t retaliated with some evil revenge plot yet.\n Me: I’m not that clever. I wish I were, because I’d be all about revenge right now.\n Ridge stops walking and turns to face me. He cocks an eyebrow, and a slightly wicked grin appears. It makes me laugh, because I can tell by his smile that he’s mapping out a plan.\n “Okay,” I say, nodding my head without even knowing what he’s about to propose. “As long as it doesn’t land us in jail.”\n Ridge: Do you know if he leaves his car unlocked?\n • • •\n “Fish?” I ask, crinkling my nose in disgust. We’ve made a pit stop at a local grocery store next to the apartment complex, and he’s buying a huge, scaly whole fish. I’m assuming this has to be part of his elaborate revenge scheme, but he could just be hungry.\n Ridge: We need duct tape.\n I follow him to the hardware aisle, where he grabs a roll of heavy-duty duct tape.\n Fresh fish and duct tape.\n I’m still not sure what he has planned, but I sort of like where this is headed.\n • • •\n When we’re back at the apartment, I point out Hunter’s car. I run up to the apartment to grab his spare car key out of my purse, where I still have it, while Ridge wraps the fish with duct tape. I come back downstairs and hand him the key.\n Me: So what exactly are we about to do with this fish?\n Ridge: Watch and learn, Sydney.\n We walk to Hunter’s car, and Ridge unlocks the passenger door. He has me tear off several pieces of duct tape while he reaches under the passenger seat. I’m watching closely—in case I need to seek revenge against anyone in the future—and he presses it against the underside of the seat. I hand him several pieces of duct tape, trying to contain my laughter while he secures the raw fish with it. After he’s sure it won’t come loose, he slides out of the car and closes the door, looking around innocently. My hand is over my mouth, stifling my laughter, and he’s as cool and composed as can be.\n We casually walk away from the car, and once we’re on the stairs to the apartment, we begin laughing.\n Ridge: His car is going to smell like death in a matter of twenty-four hours. He’ll never find it.\n Me: You’re kind of evil. If I didn’t know better, I’d think you’ve done this before.\n He laughs as we make our way back inside. We kick off our shoes at the door, and he tosses the duct tape onto the counter. I use the bathroom and make sure to unlock the door to his bedroom before I walk back out. In the living room, all the lights are out, except for the lamp by the couch. I lie down and check my phone one last time before turning it on silent.\n Ridge: Good night. Sorry your birthday sucked.\n Me: Thanks to you, it was better than it could have been.\n I place the phone under my pillow and cover up. I close my eyes, and my smile immediately fades when the silence takes over. I can feel the tears coming, so I cover my head with the blanket and brace myself for a long night of heartache. The respite with Ridge was nice, but I have nothing to distract me now from the fact that I’m having the worst day of my life. I can’t understand how Tori could do something like this to me. We’ve been best friends for almost three years. I told her everything. I trusted her with everything. I told her things I would never dream of telling Hunter.\n Why would she risk our friendship for sex?\n I’ve never felt this hurt. I pull the blanket over my eyes and begin to sob.\n Happy birthday to me.\n • • •\n I have the pillow pulled tightly over my head, but it doesn’t drown out the sound of gravel crunching beneath shoes. Why is someone walking on a driveway so noisily? And why can I even hear it?\n Wait. Where am I?\n Did yesterday really happen?\n I reluctantly open my eyes, and I’m met with sunlight, so I pull the pillow tighter over my face and give myself a minute to adjust. The sound seems to get louder, so I lift the pillow from my face and peer out with one eye open. The first thing I see is a kitchen that isn’t mine.\n Oh, yeah. That’s right. I’m on Ridge’s couch, and twenty-two is the worst age ever.\n I lift the pillow all the way off my head and groan as I squeeze my eyes shut again.\n “Who are you and why are you sleeping on my couch?”\n My body jumps, and my eyes flick open at the deep voice that can’t be more than a foot away. Two eyes peer down at me. I pull my head back against the couch to put more space between me and the curious eyes to get a better look at who they’re attached to.\n It’s a guy. A guy I’ve never seen before. He’s sitting on the floor directly in front of the couch, and he’s holding a bowl. He dips a spoon into the bowl and shoves it into his mouth, then begins the loud crunching again. I’m guessing that’s not gravel he’s eating.\n “Are you the new roommate?” he says with his mouth full.\n I shake my head. “No,” I mutter. “I’m a friend of Ridge’s.”\n He cocks his head and looks at me suspiciously. “Ridge only has one friend,” the guy says. “Me.” He shoves another spoonful of cereal into his mouth and fails to back out of my personal space.\n I push my palms into the couch and sit up so that he’s not right in my face. “Jealous?” I ask.\n The guy continues to stare at me. “What’s his last name?”\n “Whose last name?”\n “Your very good friend, Ridge,” he says cockily.\n I roll my eyes and drop my head against the back of the couch. I don’t know who the hell this guy is, but I really don’t care to compete over our levels of friendship with Ridge. “I don’t know Ridge’s last name. I don’t know his middle name. The only thing I know about him is that he’s got a mean right hook. And I’m only sleeping on your couch because my boyfriend of two years decided it would be fun to screw my roommate and I really didn’t want to stick around to watch.”\n He nods, then swallows. “It’s Lawson. And he doesn’t have a middle name.”\n As if the morning could get any worse, Bridgette appears from the hallway and walks into the kitchen.\n The guy on the floor takes another spoonful of cereal and looks at Bridgette, finally breaking his uncomfortable lock on me. “Good morning, Bridgette,” he says with an odd, sarcastic tone to his voice. “Sleep well?”\n She looks at him briefly and rolls her eyes. “Screw you, Warren,” she snaps.\n He turns his gaze back to mine with a mischievous grin. “That’s Bridgette,” he whispers. “She pretends to hate me during the day, but at night, she loves me.”\n I laugh, not really trusting that Bridgette is capable of loving anyone.\n “Shit!” she yells, catching herself on the bar before she trips. “Jesus Christ!” She kicks one of my suitcases, still on the floor next to the bar. “Tell your little friend if she’s staying here, she needs to take her shit to her room!”\n Warren makes a face as if he’s scared for me, then turns his head toward Bridgette. “What am I, your bitch? Tell her yourself.”\n Bridgette points to the suitcase she almost tripped over. “GET . . . YOUR . . . SHIT . . . OUT . . . OF . . . THE . . . KITCHEN!” she says, before marching back to her bedroom.\n Warren slowly turns his head back to face me and laughs. “Why does she think you’re deaf?”\n I shrug. “I have no idea. She came to that conclusion last night, and I failed to correct her.”\n He laughs again, much louder. “Oh, this is classic,” he says. “Do you have any pets?”\n I shake my head.\n “Are you opposed to porn?”\n I don’t know how we just began playing Twenty Questions, but I answer him anyway. “Not opposed to the principle of porn but opposed to being featured in one.”\n He nods, contemplating my answer for a beat too long. “Do you have annoying friends?”\n I shake my head. “My best friend is a backstabbing whore, and I’m no longer speaking to her.”\n “What are your showering habits?”\n I laugh. “Once a day, with a skipped day every now and then. No more than fifteen minutes.”\n “Do you cook?”\n “Only when I’m hungry.”\n “Do you clean up after yourself?”\n “Probably better than you,” I say, taking in the fact that he’s used his shirt for a napkin no fewer than three times during this conversation.\n “Do you listen to disco?”\n “I’d rather eat barbed wire.”\n “All right, then,” he says. “I guess you can stay.”\n I pull my feet up and sit cross-legged. “I didn’t realize I was being interviewed.”\n He glances at my suitcases, then back to me. “It’s obvious you need a place to stay, and we’ve got an empty room. If you don’t take it, Bridgette wants to move her sister in next month, and that’s the last thing Ridge and I need.”\n “I can’t stay here,” I say.\n “Why not? From the sound of it, you’re about to spend the day searching for an apartment anyway. What’s wrong with this one? You won’t even have to walk very far to get here.”\n I want to say that Ridge is the problem. He’s been nice, but I think that might be the issue. I’ve been single for less than twenty-four hours, and I don’t like the fact that although I should have been consumed with nightmares about Hunter and Tori all night, instead, I had a slightly disturbing dream involving an extremely accommodating Ridge.\n I don’t tell Warren that Ridge is why I can’t stay here, though. Partly because that would give Warren more ammunition for questions and partly because Ridge just walked into the kitchen and is looking at us.\n Warren winks at me, then stands up and walks with his bowl to the sink. He looks at Ridge. “Have you met our new roommate?” Warren asks.\n Ridge signs something to him. Warren shakes his head and signs back. I sit on the couch and watch their silent conversation, slightly in awe that Warren knows sign language. I wonder if he’s learned it for Ridge’s benefit. Maybe they’re brothers? Warren laughs, and Ridge glances in my direction before walking back to his bedroom.\n “What did he say?” I ask, suddenly worried that Ridge no longer wants me here.\n Warren shrugs and begins walking back toward his bedroom. “Exactly what I thought he’d say.” He walks into his room, then comes back out with a cap on and keys in his hand. “He said you two already worked out a deal.” Warren slips a pair of shoes on by the front door. “Heading to work now. That’s your room if you want to put your stuff in it. You might have to throw all of Brennan’s shit in the corner, though.” He opens the door and steps outside, then turns back around. “Oh. What’s your name?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/maybe-someday/page-9.html","bookId":2711,"book":{"id":2711,"title":"Maybe Someday","description":"Storyline: \n At twenty-two years old, aspiring musician Sydney Blake has a great life: She’s in college, working a steady job, in love with her wonderful boyfriend, Hunter, and rooming with her good friend, Tori.
