Welcome to the weirdest place you’ll ever live.” He shuts the door behind him.\n I’m not sure I’m comfortable with this, but what other choice do I have? I pull my phone out from under my pillow. I start to text Ridge, because I don’t recall closing a deal last night regarding my living arrangements. Before I finish the text, he sends me one first.\n Ridge: Are you okay with this?\n Me: Are you?\n Ridge: I asked you first.\n Me: I guess. But only if you are.\n Ridge: Well, then, I guess that means we’re roommates.\n Me: If we’re roommates, can you do me a favor?\n Ridge: What’s that?\n Me: If I ever start dating again, don’t be like Tori and sleep with my boyfriend, okay?\n Ridge: I can’t make any promises.\n A few seconds later, he walks out of his bedroom and goes straight to my suitcases. He picks them up and carries them through the other bedroom door. He opens it and nods his head toward the room, indicating that I should come with him. I stand up and follow him into the bedroom. He lays the suitcases on the bed, then pulls his phone out again.\n Ridge: Brennan still has a lot of stuff in here. I’ll box it up and put it in the corner until he can get it all. Other than that, you might want to change the sheets.\n He shoots me a wary look regarding the condition of the sheets, and I laugh. He points to the bathroom.\n Ridge: We share the bathroom. Just lock the main door to the hallway and both doors to the bedrooms when you’re in there. I obviously won’t know when you’re in the shower, so unless you want me barging in on you, make sure to lock up.\n He walks to the bathroom and flips a light switch on the outside of the door, which turns the lights on and off inside the bathroom, then turns his attention back to the phone.\n Ridge: I added switches on the outside because it’s an easy way for someone to get my attention, since I can’t hear a knock. Just flip the switch if you need to come into the bathroom so I’ll know. The whole apartment is set up this way. There’s a switch outside my bedroom door that turns my lights on and off if you need me. But I usually have my phone on me, so there’s always texting.\n He shows me where clean sheets are and then cleans out what’s left in the dresser while I put the new sheets on the bed.\n “Do I need furniture?”\n Ridge shakes his head.\n Ridge: He’s leaving it. You can use what’s here.\n I nod, taking in the bedroom that has unexpectedly just become my new home. I smile at Ridge to let him know I appreciate his help. “Thank you.”\n He smiles back.\n Ridge: I’ll be in my room working for the next few hours if you need anything. I have to go to the store this afternoon. You can go with me and get what you need for the apartment.\n He backs out of the bedroom and gives me a salute. I sit down on the edge of the bed and salute him back as he shuts the door. I fall back onto the bed and let out a huge sigh of relief.\n Now that I have a place to live, all I need is a job. And maybe a car, since Tori and I mostly shared hers. Then maybe I’ll call my parents and tell them I moved.\n Or maybe not. I’ll give this place a couple of weeks in order to see how things turn out.\n Ridge: Oh, and btw, I didn’t write that on your forehead.\n What?\n I run to the dresser and look in the mirror for the first time today. Written across my forehead in black ink, it says: Someone wrote on your forehead.\n Ridge\n Me: Morning. How’s the thesis coming along?\n Maggie: Do you want me to sugar-coat it, or are you honestly giving me an opening to vent?\n Me: Wide open. Vent away.\n Maggie: I’m miserable, Ridge. I hate it. I work on it for hours every day, and I just want to take a bat to my computer and go all Office Space on it. If this thesis were a child, I’d put it up for adoption and not even think twice about it. If this thesis were a cute, fuzzy puppy, I’d drop it off in the middle of a busy intersection and speed away.\n Me: And then you would do a U-turn and go back and pick it up and play with it all night.\n Maggie: I’m serious, Ridge. I think I’m losing my mind.\n Me: Well, you already know what I think.\n Maggie: Yes, I know what you think. Let’s not get into that right now.\n Me: You’re the one who wanted to vent. You don’t need this kind of stress.\n Maggie: Stop.\n Me: I can’t, Maggie. You know how I feel, and I’m not keeping my opinion to myself when we both know I’m right.\n Maggie: This is exactly why I never whine to you about it, because it always comes back to this same thing. I asked you to stop. Please, Ridge. Stop.\n Me: Okay.\n Me: I’m sorry. . . .\n Me: Now is when you return a text that says, “It’s okay, Ridge. I love you.” . . .\n Me: Hello? . . .\n Me: Don’t do this, Maggie.\n Maggie: Give a girl a minute to pee! Dang. I’m not mad. I just don’t want to talk about it anymore. How are you?\n Me: Phew. Good. We got a new roommate.\n Maggie: I thought she wasn’t moving in until next month.\n Me: No, it’s not Bridgette’s sister. It’s Sydney. The one I was telling you about a few days ago? After I decided to break the news to her about her boyfriend, it left her with nowhere to go. Warren and I are letting her stay here until she finds her own place. You’ll like her.\n Maggie: So I guess she believed you about her boyfriend?\n Me: Yeah. She was pretty pissed at first that I didn’t tell her sooner, but she’s had a few days to let it sink in, so I think she gets it. So what time will you be here Friday?\n Maggie: Not sure. I would say it depends on whether I get enough work done on my thesis, but I’m not mentioning my thesis to you ever again. I guess I’ll get there when I get there.\n Me: Well, then, I guess I’ll see you when I see you. Love you. Let me know when you’re on your way.\n Maggie: Love you, too. And I know you’re just concerned. I don’t expect you to agree with my decisions, but I do want you to understand them.\n Me: I do understand, babe. I do. I love you.\n Maggie: Love you, too.\n I drop my head forcefully against the headboard and rub my palms up and down my face out of sheer frustration. Of course, I understand her decision, but I’ll never feel good about it. She’s so frustratingly determined I seriously don’t see how I’ll ever get through to her.\n I stand up and put my phone into my back pocket, then walk to my bedroom door. When I swing it open, I’m met with a smell that I’m positive is exactly what heaven will smell like.\n Bacon.\n Warren looks up at me from the dining-room table and grins, pointing to his plate full of food. “She’s a keeper,” he signs. “The eggs suck, though. I’m only eating them because I don’t want to complain, or she might never cook for us again. Everything else is great.” He signs everything he’s saying without verbalizing it. Warren usually verbalizes all of his signed communication, out of respect for others around us. When he doesn’t verbalize, I know he wants our conversation to remain between the two of us.\n Like the silent one we’re having right now while Sydney’s in the kitchen.\n “And she even asked how we liked our coffee,” he signs.\n I glance into the kitchen. Sydney smiles, so I smile back. I’m shocked to see her in a good mood today. After we got back from our trip to the store a few days ago, she’s been spending most of the time in her room. At one point yesterday, Warren went in to ask her if she wanted any dinner, and he said she was on her bed crying, so he backed out and left her alone. I’ve wanted to check on her, but there isn’t really anything I can do to make her feel better. All she can do is give it time, so I’m glad she’s at least out of bed today.\n “And don’t look right now, Ridge. But did you see what she’s wearing? Did you see that dress?” He bites the knuckles on his fist and winces, as if simply looking at her is causing him actual physical pain.\n I shake my head and take a seat across from him. “I’ll look later.”\n He grins. “I’m so glad her boyfriend cheated on her. Otherwise, I’d be eating leftover toothpaste-filled Oreos for breakfast.”\n I laugh. “At least you wouldn’t have to brush your teeth.”\n “This was the best decision we’ve ever made,” he says. “Maybe later we can talk her into vacuuming in that dress while we sit on the couch and watch.”\n Warren laughs at his own comment, but I don’t crack a smile. I don’t think he realizes he signed and spoke that last sentence. Before I can tell him, a biscuit comes hurtling past my head and smacks him in the face. He jumps back in shock and looks at Sydney. She’s walking to the table with a Don’t mess with me look on her face. She hands me a plate of food, then sets her own plate down in front of her and takes a seat.\n “I said that out loud, didn’t I?” Warren asks. I nod. He looks at Sydney, and she’s still glaring at him. “At least I was complimenting you,” he says with a shrug.\n She laughs and nods once, as if he just made a good point. She picks up her phone and begins to text. She glances at me briefly, giving her head a slight shake when my phone vibrates in my pocket. She texted me something but apparently doesn’t want me to make it obvious. I casually slide my hand into my pocket and pull my phone out, then read her text under the table.\n Sydney: Don’t eat the eggs.\n I look at her and arch an eyebrow, wondering what the hell is wrong with the eggs. She casually sends another text while she holds a conversation with Warren.\n Sydney: I poured dish soap and baby powder in them. It’ll teach him not to write on my forehead again.\n Me: WTH? When are you going to tell him?\n Sydney: I’m not.\n Warren: What are you and Sydney texting about?\n I look up to see Warren holding his phone, staring at me. He picks up his fork and takes another bite of the eggs, and the sight makes me laugh. He lunges across the table and grabs my phone out of my hands, then begins scrolling through the texts. I try to grab it back from him, but he pulls his arm out of my reach. He pauses for a few seconds as he reads, then immediately spits his mouthful back onto his plate. He tosses me back my phone and reaches for his glass. He calmly takes a drink, sets it back down on the table, then pushes his chair back and stands up.\n He points to Sydney. “You just messed up, little girl,” he says. “This means war.”\n Sydney is smirking at him with a challenging gleam in her eye. Once Warren walks back to his bedroom and shuts his door, she loses the confident smirk and turns to me, wide-eyed.\n Sydney: Help me! I need ideas. I suck at pranks!\n Me: Yeah, you do. Dish soap and baby powder? You need serious help. Good thing you have the master on your side.\n She grins, then begins eating her breakfast.\n I don’t even get my first bite down before Bridgette walks out of her room, sans smile. She walks straight to the kitchen and proceeds to make herself a plate of food. Warren returns from his room and sits back down at the table.\n “I walked away for dramatic effect,” he says. “I wasn’t finished eating yet.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/maybe-someday/page-10.html","bookId":2711,"book":{"id":2711,"title":"Maybe Someday","description":"Storyline: \n At twenty-two years old, aspiring musician Sydney Blake has a great life: She’s in college, working a steady job, in love with her wonderful boyfriend, Hunter, and rooming with her good friend, Tori.
