{"id":82827,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Dean stared at the number sixteen on Evy\u0027s apartment door, the folded note in his hand and a lump in his throat. The hallway was quiet and smelled like laundry. He knelt down and slid the note under the door, hesitated and pulled it back. Uncertainty and alcohol fused inside his brain like a twisting DNA strand. With the pop of a kneecap he stood back up and glanced down the barren hallway. He knew it wouldn\u0027t take Ryder long to switch out his deflated tire with the spare, which is why Dean had ordered a cab to meet him at his place. With his car safely parked at his condo for the night, Ryder would (hopefully) think he had gone home to sleep one off. Instead, the cab had dropped Dean off two blocks from Evy\u0027s apartment, buying him some much needed time he might as well spend.\n He inhaled through his nose and knocked lightly before losing his nerve. The silence rang his ears as he stared at the peephole. He glanced at his watch and winced. It was just past one in the morning and if she wasn\u0027t pissed before, she would be now. This was a mistake. Just when he was about to slide the note under the door and leave, the door cracked open, jarring his insides with a bolt of electricity that made the hairs stand up on the back of his neck.\n Evy squinted at him through sleepy eyes, stealing his breath. A swarm of butterflies launched in his stomach at the sight of the necklace he had given her. She hadn\u0027t thrown it away. His gaze ran its needy fingers to the bare legs spilling from a pair of gym shorts. A fond look softened his eyes. Even waking from a dead sleep she looked beautiful. Heart racing, he shifted from one foot to the other, feeling lightheaded with those green eyes upon him once again.\n Her face stiffened. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked curtly.\n \"I need to talk to you.\"\n An angry snort burst from her nose. \"You had your chance and blew it,\" she said, slamming the door in his face.\n His hand jetted out and caught it just in time. He pushed the door open, bringing a startled look to her distended face.\n \"What\u0027re you doing?\" she cried, pushing back with both hands.\n He wrestled against her weight and squeezed through the narrow gap. The door crashed shut behind him with force, shaking the walls and narrowly taking off his fingers in the process.\n \"You asshole!\" she barked, backing away like he was a home intruder. Her arms folded over a teal camisole to hide the bare breasts beneath. \"You think you can just toy with my feelings like one of your little...playthings? Come and go as you please?\" Tears carved out paths down her reddening cheeks.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said softly, unable to stop himself from reaching for her, needing to touch her just one more time.\n She slapped his hands away like a child, retreating into the living room. \"Get out!\"\n \"I just...\"\n \"You just what?\" she cried, smacking his hands again as he continued his desperate pursuit. \"Need to get laid because you\u0027re drunk? Well, fuck you! I hate you!\"\n \"No, listen,\" he said, a knot of need tightening in his gut as her sweet scent stormed his senses. \"There\u0027s more to it, I just...\"\n \"It\u0027s called the truth, Dean!\"\n His fingertips grazed her arm and sent a charge shooting through his bloodstream. \"It\u0027s complicated.\"\n Evy backed into a wall, her eyes glittering with rage. \"I don\u0027t care. I don\u0027t want to hear it.\" Her body tensed when his hands found her waist. She pushed against his wrists. \"I don\u0027t want to see you ever again!\" Her fists turned to hammers, beating on his chest. \"I don\u0027t want to...\"\n \"Shut up,\" he said, pulling her to him and kissing her hard.\n Her eyes widened with his boldness. She hesitated before squirming free and slapping him across the face. \"You asshole!\"\n Dean wrapped an arm around her waist and yanked her against him with a high-pitched noise escaping her. Heat flushed across his front side as he pressed against body. She tensed, surprised and unnerved, staring up at him with her mouth hanging open in a stunned silence. Their eyes locked, the heat of their bodies mingling in the dim glow from the light above the stove. The tension was palpable. His lips lowered to hers. Evy snapped from her daze and writhed for freedom, calling him every name in the book. He held her against him, refusing to let her go no matter how nasty she got. She called him a bastard and he forced his lips to hers again, shutting her up and sucking her into his heart and soul in a single blow.\n She pushed against him and tore her mouth away. \"No,\" she whispered between frantic gulps of air, her eyes betraying her.\n He clenched his teeth and pinned her wrists to the wall. Before she could protest further, he slipped his tongue into her warm mouth. She struggled against him but he wouldn\u0027t budge, kissing her long and hard. Her lips were soft and sweet and he never wanted to let them go. He released one of her arms to seize her breast. She moaned and pulled at his hair. He pinched her nipple and she kissed him back, sucking his bottom lip into her mouth with hunger.\n Her hands wrapped around his neck and pulled him close, his heart fluttering against her. They kissed with passion, their noses softly rubbing as their heads tilted back and forth. He broke their kiss when her hand found the bulge in his slacks. He chased his breath and looked her in the eye.\n \"I love you.\"\n She massaged his groin, watering the erection inside. \"I hate you,\" she whispered back.\n He picked her up and spun her around. Her legs coiled around him as he carried her to the couch, swimming in those green pools along the way. A startled breath slipped from somewhere deep down inside when he dropped her onto the cushions. He hovered over her, his famished eyes ravaging her from her tousled hair to her red toes. His chest rose and fell with anticipation as his coat slipped to the floor with nary a move. She reached up and grabbed his tie, pulling him on top of her. Their mouths exchanged another heated kiss. He pressed his erection into her stomach and pulled on her hair, forcing her head back so he could attack her neck like a creature of the night.\n She groaned as his lips molested the vulnerable spot below her ear. His warm breath washed over her with a want that would not be denied. His teeth bit into her neck, nearly breaking the skin. She curled fistfuls of his hair into her hands and pulled, her eyes burning with desire.\n \"Fuck me,\" she wheezed, pushing him to his knees and pulling his shirt open like he was Superman. Buttons popped across the room, landing God knows where. He slipped out of the ruined shirt while her hands frantically unbuckled his belt and jerked his pants down to his knees, taking the underwear with them. His throbbing cock broke free and she seized it with both hands, stroking him with a fervent yearning that nearly made him explode. His breath came as fast as her stokes. She looked up and met his smoldering gaze, needing to melt with him just one more time. She cupped his balls and took him into her mouth.\n He arched his back and squeezed his eyes shut. Stars exploded across the back of his eyelids as her luscious lips slid up and down his rigid shaft with a tenderness he had yet to encounter. He moaned her name out loud, massaging her head with his hands. It had never been this good. Ever. He opened his eyes and watched her take him all in, inhaling him like much needed air.\n He tightened his buttocks and clenched his teeth. \"Stop,\" he begged.\n She withdrew and looked up at him with a sparkle in her eyes. He rid himself of everything but his necktie, their ragged breath the only sound in the room.\n Her eyes scoured every inch of his sculpted body, from his broad shoulders and carved out abs to his toned thighs and calves. Her tongue swept across her lips, wanting everything he had to offer and more. He yanked her shorts down and tore off her panties. She gasped as the material ripped, tried to sit up but he forced her back down and pushed her top up over her breasts.\n Blood rushed through his arteries so fast he thought he might pass out. He studied her body, memorizing every breathtaking curve. With a wry grin, she spread her legs, giving him an unimpeded shot of her creamy center below. His hand ran along the inside of her smooth leg, loving the way she trembled beneath his touch. His fingers found her soft spot and gently traced her clitoris, rubbing circles into her wet flesh.\n \"Dean,\" she panted, closing her eyes.\n The look on her face nearly made him cum. He picked her up and twirled her on top of him. She straddled him, looking down into his animalistic eyes as he slipped inside of her.\n He sat up and cupped her face, studying her like a magnificent work of art. A steamy breath shot from her lips. Her voice quivered when she spoke. \"I love you, Dean.\"\n Dean stared into her eyes, his heart swelling. \"I love you more than anything in the world.\"\n Evy watched him as they melted together, not knowing where one began and the other ended. She smiled and took him in deeper, meeting his greedy thrusts. Fireworks exploded inside her head. She increased her tempo, their skin slapping against each other in perfect rhythm, snatching stubborn gulps of air around them. Evy stopped penny-pinching and seized every inch he had to offer. A lamp shook on the end table.\n \"Oh shit!\" he groaned.\n She threw her head back and cried out.\n He took her face in his hand and directed her eyes to meet his. \"Look at me when you cum.\"\n Her breath was warm and ragged. She set her jaw and dug her nails into his shoulders, staring into his demanding gaze.\n Dean bit the inside of his cheek to keep from exploding too soon. The metallic taste of blood quickly filled his mouth.\n \"Dean!\"\n The way she moaned his name was music to his ears. \"Cum for me baby!\"\n \"Oh God, Dean!\"\n Her muscles tightened around him, an untamed look in her eyes. He couldn\u0027t hold it much longer. Evy looked him right in the eye, and released a shrill cry that had to of woken the entire building. Her body shuddered against his as she came like never before. The look on her face drove him wild. He gritted his teeth and exploded inside of her, looking into her eyes and grunting his release with breathless fulfillment. They climaxed together, shaking with an unrestrained passion most would never find. She watched his face, awestruck as he emptied himself into her with pulsating bursts.\n Dean\u0027s face softened as he fell into her dreamy eyes.\n She leaned in closer, their lips stopping just before they connected.\n \"You make me so crazy, Evy,\" he whispered between pants.\n She exhaled a wistful breath and pressed her mouth to his, holding him tightly. They broke their kiss and held each others\u0027 starry eyed gaze.\n \"I really do love you,\" she whispered.\n A grin stretched his lips. \"I know.\"\n She laughed and slapped his shoulder. \"You\u0027re such a jerk.\"\n He laid back and wrapped her in his arms on the couch, spooning with her in a blissful stillness as they quietly collected their breath. Time seemed to stop and he wished they could stay like that forever. Never leave her apartment again, content just being next to her until the end of time. He waited for her to fall asleep in his arms before closing his eyes and drifting off to a place where his troubles could no longer find him.\n Evy stirred on the couch and cracked her eyelids. Dawn\u0027s early light cast a faint glow across the living room as she took in her surroundings, bemused to not be in her bed. She smiled as flashes from the night before pushed to the forefront of her mind, making her stomach tingle with euphoria. It wasn\u0027t a dream after all. She sat bolt upright on the couch, her eyes darting around the living room. Her heart plummeted with the realization she was naked and alone. Her frantic gaze jumped back to the coffee table where a tented note sat with her name scrawled across it. She swung her bare feet to the carpet and snatched it, her eyes rapidly roaming back and forth across the handwritten words nearly as fast as her heart was beating. The early morning quiet was as thick as tar as Dean\u0027s words slowly sank in. She lifted her watery gaze to the soft light oozing through the windows and clutched her heart like it might fall out of her chest.\n \"Oh my God,\" she muttered, blinking a tear down her cheek. She snatched her cell phone from the coffee table and tried calling him, her mind reeling as potential scenarios whisked through her head, each one more horrifying than the one before it. His voice on the greeting made her shudder with need and fold with despair at the same time. She had missed him. But maybe not.\n After the beep, she took a steadying breath that had no effect. \"Dean, please don\u0027t do this,\" her voice cracked. \"We\u0027ll figure out a different way. Just don\u0027t get on that plane.\" Evy paused to collect her racing thoughts even though the clock was ticking. \"Call me as soon as you get this. The only thing that matters is that I love...\" The beep cut her off. The color fled her cheeks as she slowly lowered the cell phone and stared at it like it was diseased. Her stomach rolled, knowing she had missed him. Knowing he was already on airplane to marry another woman. Regardless of how tight Evy clutched her chest, her heart broke in two. Tears rolled down her cheeks and splashed onto her bare legs. She wiped her eyes and scanned the note again, wondering how any of it could possibly be true. The cell phone rang in her hand. She screamed and dropped it to the floor, where it tumbled across the carpet like it was trying to get away.\n Evy bent over and snatched it. Relief doused her flames of anxiety when she saw the screen. She hurriedly answered. \"Where are you?\"\n A long pause filled her with dread.\n \"I\u0027m at the airport,\" Dean whispered. \"I can\u0027t talk long. She\u0027s in the bathroom.\"\n A mumbled female voice squawked something over a PA system in the background.\n \"Dean, don\u0027t you dare get on that plane.\"\n \"I have to, Evy,\" he insisted. \"If I don\u0027t...\"\n \"Goddamnit Dean, we\u0027ll figure out another way, just don\u0027t get...\"\n \"I know we will,\" he cut her off. \"But until we figure that out I have to get on this plane. Clay Crawford will ruin all of us. You\u0027ve seen what he can do.\"\n \"Dean, please,\" she sobbed.\n \"Evy,\" he said calmly, knowing time was money. \"Just know that I love you more than anything in the world and we will be together very soon. I promise you that.\"\n Evy inhaled a deep breath that made a wheezing sound. \"B-But you\u0027ll be married.\"\n \"Not for long, and it won\u0027t be real anyway. Not in my heart. You know that.\"\n She wiped her cheeks with her hand. \"To her it will be! And what\u0027re you going to do when she wants to consummate the marriage, Dean? Then what?\"\n Another pause seemed to last forever and she wondered if the call was dropped.\n \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ve got a plan for that.\"\n She shook her head, refusing to accept any of it. \"Like what?\"\n \"Do you trust me?\"\n Her tattered breath hissed through the line. \"Yes.\"\n \"Then say it.\"\n \"Dean, I just think that...\"\n \"Say it!\"\n She tried swallowing the lump in her throat but it wouldn\u0027t go down without a fight. \"I trust you.\"\n \"Shit, here she comes. I have to go.\"\n \"Dean!\" she cried, her bulging eyes scanning her darkened TV as if she could see the whole thing playing out before her. Silence stole her breath. He had hung up before she could tell him the one thing she wanted him to hear above all else.\n \"Yeah?\"\n Her heart quivered at the sound of his voice. \"I love you.\"\n \"I love you, too.\"\n A soft click sent wrinkles carving through her forehead. \"Dean? Hello?\" When there was no reply she lowered the cell phone and stared blankly at the screen. And just like that, he was gone. Her hand went to her necklace and ran its fingers across the arrow, an unbearable silence squeezing the oxygen from her lungs. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fate-interrupted-fate-interrupted-1/page-15.html","bookId":1872,"book":{"id":1872,"title":"Fate Interrupted (Fate Interrupted #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Fate Interrupted (Fate Interrupted #1) \n Dean Jacobs is one of Milwaukee’s hottest eligible bachelors and in no mood to settle down, until she comes along.
