{"id":43915,"no":47,"title":"Chapter 51 Pyramus and Thisbe","content":"ABOUT TWO-THIRDS of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood, where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction, extended a large garden, where the wide-spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart, and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate, that dated from the time of Louis XII. This noble entrance, however, in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases, as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom, had fallen into utter disuse. The proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself, with its thickly planted court-yard, opening into the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and to the garden shut in by this gate, which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen-garden of about an acre. For the demon of speculation drew a line, or in other words projected a street, at the farther side of the kitchen-garden. The street was laid out, a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate, but before construction was begun, it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables, by building along the line of the proposed street, and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg Saint-Honoré itself, one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of Paris. In matters of speculation, however, though \"man proposes,\" \"money disposes.\" From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden, having paid a high price for it, and being quite unable to find any one willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners, at a yearly rental of 500 francs. And so, as we have said, the iron gate leading into the kitchen-garden had been closed up and left to the rust, which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges, while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion, the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet. True, the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices; but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance. Horticulture seemed, however, to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen-garden; and where cabbages, carrots, radishes, pease, and melons had once flourished, a scanty crop of lucerne alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation. A small, low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street, the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters, and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one-half per cent it had originally paid. Towards the house the chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall, without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air. At one corner, where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day, a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house, which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it, though situated but a hundred paces off. Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare, the cool, refreshing shade, the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun, that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer, the incessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion. On the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of Paris, might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench, a book, a parasol, and a work-basket, from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief, while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman, standing close to the iron gate, endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks,--the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes, proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter. At that instant the little side-gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened, and a tall, powerful young man appeared. He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap, but his carefully arranged hair, beard and mustache, all of the richest and glossiest black, ill accorded with his plebeian attire. After casting a rapid glance around him, in order to assure himself that he was unobserved, he entered by the small gate, and, carefully closing and securing it after him, proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier. At the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a costume, the young woman started in terror, and was about to make a hasty retreat. But the eye of love had already seen, even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe, and observed the fluttering of the blue sash. Pressing his lips close to the planks, he exclaimed, \"Don\u0027t be alarmed, Valentine--it is I!\" Again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate, saying, as she did so, \"And why do you come so late to-day? It is almost dinner-time, and I had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful mother-in-law, my too-devoted maid, and my troublesome brother, who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery, which I am in a fair way never to get done. So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait, and, after that, tell me why I see you in a dress so singular that at first I did not recognize you.\" \"Dearest Valentine,\" said the young man, \"the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love, but yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul, and tell you how fondly I adore you. If it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments, I could even thank you for chiding me, for it leaves me a gleam of hope, that if you did not expect me (and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose), at least I was in your thoughts. You asked me the cause of my being late, and why I come disguised. I will candidly explain the reason of both, and I trust to your goodness to pardon me. I have chosen a trade.\" \"A trade? Oh, Maximilian, how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness?\" \"Heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself! But listen to me, Valentine, and I will tell you all about it. I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief. That would compromise the honor of the French army, to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise; so I have become a gardener, and, consequently, adopted the costume of my calling.\" \"What excessive nonsense you talk, Maximilian!\" \"Nonsense? Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my life by such a name. Consider, by becoming a gardener I effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger.\" \"I beseech of you, Maximilian, to cease trifling, and tell me what you really mean.\" \"Simply, that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I stand was to let, I made application for it, was readily accepted by the proprietor, and am now master of this fine crop of lucerne. Think of that, Valentine! There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation, and residing not twenty yards from you. Only imagine what happiness that would afford me. I can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea. Such felicity seems above all price--as a thing impossible and unattainable. But would you believe that I purchase all this delight, joy, and happiness, for which I would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life, at the small cost of 500 francs per annum, paid quarterly? Henceforth we have nothing to fear. I am on my own ground, and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall, and to look over when I please, without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character. I may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond, faithful, and unalterable affection, whenever you visit your favorite bower, unless, indeed, it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman, clad in a blouse and cap.\" A faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of Valentine, who almost instantly said, in a saddened tone, as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart, \"Alas, no, Maximilian, this must not be, for many reasons. We should presume too much on our own strength, and, like others, perhaps, be led astray by our blind confidence in each other\u0027s prudence.\" \"How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought, dear Valentine? Have I not, from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance, schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas? And you have, I am sure, the fullest confidence in my honor. When you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger, I placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service, asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you; and have I ever since, by word or look, given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you? You told me, my dear Valentine, that you were engaged to M. d\u0027Epinay, and that your father was resolved upon completing the match, and that from his will there was no appeal, as M. de Villefort was never known to change a determination once formed. I kept in the background, as you wished, and waited, not for the decision of your heart or my own, but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf, and order events in our favor. But what cared I for delays or difficulties, Valentine, as long as you confessed that you loved me, and took pity on me? If you will only repeat that avowal now and then, I can endure anything.\" \"Ah, Maximilian, that is the very thing that makes you so bold, and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy, that I frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my mother-in-law, and her blind preference for her own child, or to be, as I now am, insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these meetings, so fraught with danger to both.\" \"I will not admit that word,\" returned the young man; \"it is at once cruel and unjust. Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself? You have permitted me to converse with you from time to time, Valentine, but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere--have I not obeyed? And since I found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate--to be close to you without really seeing you--have I ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength? Never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me. I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden times. Come, come, dearest Valentine, confess that what I say is true, lest I be tempted to call you unjust.\" \"It is true,\" said Valentine, as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted Maximilian to press his lips to them, \"and you are a true and faithful friend; but still you acted from motives of self-interest, my dear Maximilian, for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us. You promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother. For I have no friend but yourself upon earth, who am neglected and forgotten by my father, harassed and persecuted by my mother-in-law, and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man, whose withered hand can no longer press mine, and who can speak to me with the eye alone, although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed, Maximilian, I am very miserable, and if you love me it must be out of pity.\" \"Valentine,\" replied the young man, deeply affected, \"I will not say you are all I love in the world, for I dearly prize my sister and brother-in-law; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil, in no manner resembling what I feel for you. When I think of you my heart beats fast, the blood burns in my veins, and I can hardly breathe; but I solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor, this fervor and intensity of feeling, until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you. M. Franz is not expected to return home for a year to come, I am told; in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us. Let us, then, hope for the best; hope is so sweet a comforter. Meanwhile, Valentine, while reproaching me with selfishness, think a little what you have been to me--the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble Venus. What promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience I have evinced?--none whatever. What granted me?--scarcely more. You tell me of M. Franz d\u0027Epinay, your betrothed lover, and you shrink from the idea of being his wife; but tell me, Valentine, is there no other sorrow in your heart? You see me devoted to you, body and soul, my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service; you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours--that were I to lose you I would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery; yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another! Oh, Valentine, were I in your place, and did I feel conscious, as you do, of being worshipped, adored, with such a love as mine, a hundred times at least should I have passed my hand between these iron bars, and said, \u0027Take this hand, dearest Maximilian, and believe that, living or dead, I am yours--yours only, and forever!\u0027\" The poor girl made no reply, but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears. A rapid change took place in the young man\u0027s feelings. \"Dearest, dearest Valentine,\" exclaimed he, \"forgive me if I have offended you, and forget the words I spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain.\" \"No, Maximilian, I am not offended,\" answered she, \"but do you not see what a poor, helpless being I am, almost a stranger and an outcast in my father\u0027s house, where even he is seldom seen; whose will has been thwarted, and spirits broken, from the age of ten years, beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me; oppressed, mortified, and persecuted, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, no person has cared for, even observed my sufferings, nor have I ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself. Outwardly and in the eyes of the world, I am surrounded by kindness and affection; but the reverse is the case. The general remark is, \u0027Oh, it cannot be expected that one of so stern a character as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters. What though she has lost her own mother at a tender age, she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de Villefort.\u0027 The world, however, is mistaken; my father abandons me from utter indifference, while my mother-in-law detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile.\" \"Hate you, sweet Valentine,\" exclaimed the young man; \"how is it possible for any one to do that?\" \"Alas,\" replied the weeping girl, \"I am obliged to own that my mother-in-law\u0027s aversion to me arises from a very natural source--her overweening love for her own child, my brother Edward.\" \"But why should it?\" \"I do not know; but, though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation, I will just say this much--that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there; and I much fear she envies me the fortune I enjoy in right of my mother, and which will be more than doubled at the death of M. and Mme. de Saint-Méran, whose sole heiress I am. Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own, and hates me for being so richly endowed. Alas, how gladly would I exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father\u0027s love. God knows, I would prefer sacrificing the whole, so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home.\" \"Poor Valentine!\" \"I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage, yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the restraint in which I am held, lest I fall utterly helpless. Then, too, my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity; protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity, no one could oppose him; he is all-powerful even with the king; he would crush you at a word. Dear Maximilian, believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt to resist my father\u0027s commands it is more on your account than my own.\" \"But why, Valentine, do you persist in anticipating the worst,--why picture so gloomy a future?\" \"Because I judge it from the past.\" \"Still, consider that although I may not be, strictly speaking, what is termed an illustrious match for you, I am, for many reasons, not altogether so much beneath your alliance. The days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in France, and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire. The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon. Now I belong to this last-named class; and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain. My fortune, though small, is free and unfettered, and the memory of my late father is respected in our country, Valentine, as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city; I say our country, because you were born not far from Marseilles.\" \"Don\u0027t speak of Marseilles, I beg of you, Maximilian; that one word brings back my mother to my recollection--my angel mother, who died too soon for myself and all who knew her; but who, after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world, now, I fondly hope, watches from her home in heaven. Oh, if my mother were still living, there would be nothing to fear, Maximilian, for I would tell her that I loved you, and she would protect us.\" \"I fear, Valentine,\" replied the lover, \"that were she living I should never have had the happiness of knowing you; you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me.\" \"Now it is you who are unjust, Maximilian,\" cried Valentine; \"but there is one thing I wish to know.\" \"And what is that?\" inquired the young man, perceiving that Valentine hesitated. \"Tell me truly, Maximilian, whether in former days, when our fathers dwelt at Marseilles, there was ever any misunderstanding between them?\" \"Not that I am aware of,\" replied the young man, \"unless, indeed, any ill-feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties--your father was, as you know, a zealous partisan of the Bourbons, while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor; there could not possibly be any other difference between them. But why do you ask?\" \"I will tell you,\" replied the young girl, \"for it is but right you should know. Well, on the day when your appointment as an officer of the Legion of honor was announced in the papers, we were all sitting with my grandfather, M. Noirtier; M. Danglars was there also--you recollect M. Danglars, do you not, Maximilian, the banker, whose horses ran away with my mother-in-law and little brother, and very nearly killed them? While the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars, I was reading the paper to my grandfather; but when I came to the paragraph about you, although I had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning (you know you had told me all about it the previous evening), I felt so happy, and yet so nervous, at the idea of speaking your name aloud, and before so many people, that I really think I should have passed it over, but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence; so I summoned up all my courage, and read it as firmly and as steadily as I could.\" \"Dear Valentine!\" \"Well, would you believe it? directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing, I was so persuaded that every one must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father start, and almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must have been a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too.\" \"\u0027Morrel, Morrel,\u0027 cried my father, \u0027stop a bit;\u0027 then knitting his brows into a deep frown, he added, \u0027surely this cannot be one of the Morrel family who lived at Marseilles, and gave us so much trouble from their violent Bonapartism--I mean about the year 1815.\u0027--\u0027Yes,\u0027 replied M. Danglars, \u0027I believe he is the son of the old shipowner.\u0027\" \"Indeed,\" answered Maximilian; \"and what did your father say then, Valentine?\" \"Oh, such a dreadful thing, that I don\u0027t dare to tell you.\" \"Always tell me everything,\" said Maximilian with a smile. \"\u0027Ah,\u0027 continued my father, still frowning, \u0027their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved; he called them \u0027food for powder,\u0027 which was precisely all they were good for; and I am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor; if Algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice, it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain. Though it certainly does cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country.\u0027\" \"Brutal politics, I must confess.\" said Maximilian; \"but don\u0027t attach any serious importance, dear, to what your father said. My father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk. \u0027Why,\u0027 said he, \u0027does not the emperor, who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war, organize a regiment of lawyers, judges and legal practitioners, sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain, and using them to save better men?\u0027 You see, my dear, that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party. But what did M. Danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur?\" \"Oh, he laughed, and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself--half-malicious, half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up and took his leave; then, for the first time, I observed the agitation of my grandfather, and I must tell you, Maximilian, that I am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame. And I suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence (for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man, without the smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong impression on his mind; for, naturally enough, it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner.\" \"The name of M. Noirtier,\" interposed Maximilian, \"is celebrated throughout Europe; he was a statesman of high standing, and you may or may not know, Valentine, that he took a leading part in every Bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the Bourbons.\" \"Oh, I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange--the father a Bonapartist, the son a Royalist; what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics? But to resume my story; I turned towards my grandfather, as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion; he looked expressively at the newspaper I had been reading. \u0027What is the matter, dear grandfather?\u0027 said I, \u0027are you pleased?\u0027 He gave me a sign in the affirmative. \u0027With what my father said just now?\u0027 He returned a sign in the negative. \u0027Perhaps you liked what M. Danglars said?\u0027 Another sign in the negative. \u0027Oh, then, you were glad to hear that M. Morrel (I didn\u0027t dare to say Maximilian) had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor?\u0027 He signified assent; only think of the poor old man\u0027s being so pleased to think that you, who were a perfect stranger to him, had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor! Perhaps it was a mere whim on his part, for he is falling, they say, into second childhood, but I love him for showing so much interest in you.\" \"How singular,\" murmured Maximilian; \"your father hates me, while your grandfather, on the contrary--What strange feelings are aroused by politics.\" \"Hush,\" cried Valentine, suddenly; \"some one is coming!\" Maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucerne, which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way, under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it. \"Mademoiselle, mademoiselle!\" exclaimed a voice from behind the trees. \"Madame is searching for you everywhere; there is a visitor in the drawing-room.\" \"A visitor?\" inquired Valentine, much agitated; \"who is it?\" \"Some grand personage--a prince I believe they said--the Count of Monte Cristo.\" \"I will come directly,\" cried Valentine aloud. The name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate, to whom Valentine\u0027s \"I am coming\" was the customary signal of farewell. 圣·奥诺路是有钱人的住宅区，各区各样的巨厦府邸都以其设计高雅和建筑华丽而相互争辉，靠近这条路的中段，在一座最富丽堂皇的大厦的后面，有一座很大的花园，园子里到处是栗子树，树冠昂然俯视着那象城堡似的又高又结实的围墙。每年春天，粉红的和雪白的栗花纷纷飘落，于是，在那路易十四时代筑成的铁门两旁方顶上的大石花盆里，就堆满了这些娇柔的花瓣。这个高贵的入口虽然外观很华丽，那种植在两只石花盆里的牛花也很多姿绰约：那杂色斑驳的叶片随风摇，深红色的花朵赏心悦目，但是，自从这座大厦的主人搬进来以后（那已是很多年以前的事了），却一直是废弃不用。大厦的正门面向圣·奥诺路，前面有一个种满花草的庭园，后面就是关闭在这扇铁门里的花园。这扇门以前原和一个肥沃的果园相通，果园的面积约一亩左右，但投机鬼却在这个果园的尽头划了一条线，也就是说，修筑了一条街道。而这条街道甚至在还没有完工之前就已经取好了名，果园的主人原想使这条街道和那条被称为圣·奥诺路的巴黎大动脉连接起来的，这样就可以把果园当作可以建筑房屋的沿街地皮卖出去了。 可是，在投机买卖上，真所谓谋事在人，成事在天。这条被定了新名字的街道始终没有修完，果园的购买者本钱付了不少，可是除非他甘心蚀一大笔钱，否则无法找到一个愿意来接手这笔买卖的人。但他相信将来总有一天会卖得一大笔钱的，到那时不但可以偿清他过去所支出的费用，而且还可以捞回那笔困死在这项投资上的资金的利息，所以他只得以年租金五百法朗的价钱，把这块地方暂时租给了一个水果贩子。因此，正如刚才已经说过的，这扇通果园的铁门已封闭了起来，任其生锈腐蚀，而的确要不了多久铁锈就会把门的铰链烂断，同时，为了防止果园里的掘土工人擅自窥视灯厦，玷污贵族的庭园，铁门上又钉了六尺高的木板。不错，木板钉得并不十分密，从板缝里仍然可以偷看到园内的景色，但那座房子里的家风极其严肃，是不怕轻狂之徒作好奇的窥视的。 在这个果园里，以前曾一度种植过最精美的水果和蔬菜，现在却只疏疏松松地种植着一些苜蓿花，由于无人照料，将来，恐怕免不了要成一块贫瘠的空地的。它和那条规划中的街道有一扇矮矮的小门相通着，开门进来，便是这块篱笆围住的荒地，尽管是荒地，一星期之前，业主却从它身上得回了千分之五的老本，而以前它是一个子都不赚的。在大厦那边，我们前面已经提到过，栗子树高高地耸立着，长得比围墙还高，其他的花木也欣欣向荣地生长着，并不受栗子树的影响，它们热切地向四面八方蔓延开去，布满了园中的空地，象在坚持它们也有权享受阳光和空气似的。花园里有一角枝叶极其茂密，几乎把阳光都关在了外面，这儿有一条大石凳和各种各样农家风味的坐椅，表明这个隐秘的去处是一个聚会的地点，或是这大厦里某位主人翁所心爱的静居处，大厦离这儿虽只有一百步左右，但从茂密的绿叶丛中望出去，却只能看到一个极模糊的影子。总之，选择这个神秘的地点作为静居处是极有道理的，因为这儿可以躲避所有窥视的目光，有凉快爽神的树荫，茂密的枝叶象是一重天幕。即使在最炎热的夏季，遇到那火烧一般的日子，灼人的阳光一丝也进不来，鸟儿的婉转歌唱，街上和大厦里的喧嚣声都传不到这儿来。 春之女神最近赐了一些极暖和的日子给巴黎的居民。这天傍晚，可以看见石凳上很随便地放着一本书，一把阳伞和一只绣花篮子，篮子里拖出一块未完工的绣花麻纱手帕。离这几样东西不远的地方，有一个青年女子站在铁门旁边，竭力从板缝中向外面张望，她的态度极其热切，眼睛一眨不眨，这可以证明她非常关心这件事。正在这时，果园通街道的那扇门无声地打开了，进来的是一个高大强壮的青年人，身上穿着一套普通的灰色工装，戴着一顶丝绒的鸭舌帽，他的头发，胡子和胡须却梳理得极其整齐，漆黑光亮，同他身上的这种平民式的打扮极不相称。他把门打开之后，迅速地向四周环顾了一下，发觉并没有人看到他，就走了进来，然后小心地把门关上了，步子匆忙地向铁门走过来。 青年女郎虽然见到了她所期待着的人，但看到服装不对，不禁大吃一惊，急忙要抽身退回。但那个眼睛里燃烧着爱情之火的青年却已经从门的缺门里看到了白衣服的动作，又看到了他那位美丽的邻居细腰上的那条蓝色腰带在飘动。他急忙跑过来，把他的嘴贴在一个缺口上，喊道：“别怕，瓦朗蒂娜，是我！” 青年女郎走近前来。“噢，阁下，”她说道，“你今天为什么来得这么晚呢？现在差不多已是吃饭前时候啦，我的后母老是监视着我，我的侍女也老是在窥探着我的一举一动，我每做一件事，每说一句话，她都得去报告，我得费好大的劲儿才能摆脱她们。还有，我的弟弟也老是讨厌地要我和他作伴，要摆脱他也不容易，我今天是借口要静静地完成一件急于完工的刺绣才得以到这儿来的。你先好好解释一下你这么晚才来的原因吧，然后再告诉我你为什么要穿这样古怪的一套衣服，我差一点认不出你了。” “亲爱的瓦朗蒂娜，”那青年说道，“我爱你到了极点，以致我不敢对你说我爱你，可是我每次看到你，总是想对你说：‘我崇拜你。’这样，当我离开你的时候，即使我回想自己的话，心里也是甜蜜的。现在我谢谢你的责备，你责备我的话实在非常可爱，因为，由此可以知道，虽不敢说你就在等候我，但却知道你在想念我。你想知道我迟到的原因和化装的理由，我一定解释给你听，也希望你能宽恕我。我已经选定一项生意。” “一项生意！噢，马西米兰，我们现在担心还来不及呢，你怎么能在这种时候还开玩笑呢？” “上帝别让我跟那比我自己的生命还宝贵的人开玩笑吧！可是听我说，瓦朗蒂娜，听我来把这件事详详细细地告诉你。我对于量地皮和爬墙头实在有点厌倦了，而且你让对我说，要是你父亲看到我在这儿逗留，很可能会把我当成一名小偷关到牢里去的，所以我很担心，因为那样会把法国全体陆军的名誉都玷污了的，同时，要是别人看到一位驻阿尔及利亚的骑兵上尉老是在这既无城堡要围攻又无要塞要守卫的地方溜达，会非常惊奇的，所以我才把自己装扮成个菜贩子，并穿上了这行职业的服装。” “你讲的话真无聊，马西米兰！” “正巧相反，我相信这是我平生最聪明的一个举动，因为我们因此可以绝对平安无事的。” “求求你了，马西米兰，把实话告诉我吧。” “很简单，因为打听到我所站的这块地皮要出租，我就去要求承租，业主马上就接受了，而我现在就是这一大片苜蓿花的主人了。想想看，瓦朗蒂娜！现在谁都来不能阻止我在自己的领地上盖起一间小房子，从此以后住在离你不到二十码的地方啦。你想我多快乐呵！我简直高兴得话都说不出来啦。你想，瓦郎蒂娜，这种事能用金钱买得到吗？不可能的，是不是？嘿，象这样幸福，这样愉快，这样高兴的事，我原是想用十年的生命来作交换的，但现在却只花了我——你猜是多少——五百法郎一年，还是按季度付款的！我现在是在我自己的土地上了，而且无疑有权可以拿一个梯子来靠在墙头上，想什么时候往这边看就什么时候爬上来看，我可以向你尽情地倾诉我对你的爱而不必怕被人带到警察局去——当然罗，除非，你觉得一个穿工装和戴鸭舌帽的穷工人向你倾诉爱情有损于你的面子。” 瓦朗蒂娜的嘴里轻轻地发出了一声惊喜交集的喊声，但象有一片嫉妒的阴云遮住了她心中的快乐似的，她几乎立刻就以一种抑郁的口吻说道，“唉，不，马西米兰！那样我们可就太放任了，我怕我们的幸福会使我们忘乎所以，以致于去滥用那种安全，这样反而会害了我们。” “你怎么会有这样不值一想的念头呢，亲爱的瓦朗蒂娜？从我们最初相识的那值得庆幸的一刻起，难道我的全部言行还不足以来向你表明我的心吗？我相信你对于我的人格也是十分信任的，当你对我说，你隐隐约约地感觉到有某种危险在威胁着你的时候，我就真诚地心甘情愿地听你驱使，不求任何报偿，只要能对你有用，我就感到很愉快了。有许多人愿意为你牺牲他们的生命，在那些人当中，你选中了我，而我是否曾在哪句话或哪次眼色上使你感到遗憾过？你告诉过我，亲爱的瓦朗蒂娜，说你已经和伊皮奈先生订了婚，而且你父亲已决心要成全这件婚事，而他的意志是不容改变的，因为维尔福先生一旦下了决心，是从来不会改变的。好，我自愿留在幕后，等待着，并不是等待我自己或你的决定，而是等待上帝的吩咐。而在这其间，你爱我，怜悯我，并坦白地告诉了我。我感谢你那句甜蜜的话，我只要求你能时时重复一下那句话，因为它可以使我忘掉其他的一切。” “啊，马西米兰，正是那句话才使得你如此大胆，而使得我既感到快乐，又感到悲伤，以致我常常问自己，究竟哪一种感情对我更好一些。是后母的严厉，偏爱她自己的孩子使我感觉到痛苦呢，还是在我和你相会的时候，感到的充满了危险的幸福？” “危险！”马西米兰大声说道，“你怎么能用这样残酷和不公平的两个字呢，难道你还能找到一个比我更柔顺的奴隶吗？你答应我可以时时和你谈话，瓦朗蒂娜，但却禁止我在你散步的时候或在其他交际场合跟踪你，我服从了。而自从我想方设法走进这个园子以后，我隔着这道门和你谈话，虽接近你却看不到你，我有哪一次想从这些缺口里伸进手来碰一碰你的衣边吗？我有没有起过推倒这堵墙的念头呢？你知道我年轻、又强壮，推倒这堵墙是不要吹灰之力的，但我从来没抱怨过你这种含蓄的态度，从来没表示过某种欲望。我象一个古代的骑士那样信守着我的诺言。来吧，至少承认了这几点吧，不然我就要觉得是你不公平啦。” “这倒是真的，”瓦朗蒂娜说道，她从木板的一个小缺口里伸出一只手指尖过来，马西米兰便在那指尖上吻了一下。“这倒是真的。你是一个可敬的朋友，但你的这种行为却仍然是出于自私的动机，亲爱的马西米兰，因为你知道得很清楚，假如你表示出某些相反的意思，我们之间的一切就都完了。你答应过要给与我热烈的兄妹之爱。我呢，除了你，在这个世界上再没有别的朋友，我的父亲根本不关心我，我的后母只一个劲地迫害我，虐待我，我惟一的伙伴就是一个不能讲话、患了麻症的老人，他那干瘪的手已不再能来紧握我的手了，只有他的眼睛可以和我谈话，他的心里无疑地还为我保留着一些余温。噢，我的命好苦呀，凡是那些比我强的人，不是把我当作了牺牲品，就是把我当作了敌人，而我惟一的朋友和支持者却是一具活尸！真的，马西米兰，我真痛苦极了，你爱我是为我着想，不是为了你自己，这的确是对的。” “瓦朗蒂娜，”青年被深深地感动了，说道，“我不能说在这个世界上我所爱的人只有你，因为我也爱我的妹妹和妹夫，但我对他们的爱是宁静的，绝不象我对你的爱。只要一想到你，我的心跳就加速，血管里的血就流得更快了，我的胸膛就开始心烦意乱起伏不定，但我郑重地答应你，我会克制住这一切热情来为你效劳或帮助你的。我听说，弗兰兹先生一年之内是不会回国的，在这期间，我们最好还是满怀希望吧。因为希望是这样甜蜜的一个安慰者。瓦朗蒂娜，当你怪我自私的时候，暂且请稍微想一想你对我的态度吧，那活象是一尊美丽而冷漠的爱神像。对于那种忠诚，那种服从，那种自制，你拿什么来回报我吗？没有。你有没有赐给过我什么？极少。你告诉我说弗兰兹·伊皮奈先生是你的未婚夫，说你每当想到将来要做他的妻子就感到害怕。告诉我，瓦朗蒂娜，你的心里难道再没有别的什么念头了吗？我把我的整个生命都奉献给了你，还有我的灵魂，甚至我的心的每一次最轻微的跳动都是为了你。而当我这样整个人都已属于你了的时候，当我对自己说，要是我失去了你，我就会死了的时候，而你，当你想到自己将属于另外一个人的时候，却并不心惊胆战！噢，瓦朗蒂娜，瓦朗蒂娜呀！假如我处在你的位置上，假如我知道自己被人深深地爱着，象我爱你这样，我至少已有一百次把我的手从这些铁栅之间伸过来了，对可怜的马西米兰说：‘我是你的了，马西米兰，今生来世，都只属于你！’” 瓦朗蒂娜没有回答，但她的爱人却可以清晰地听到她在哭泣。那青年的情感立刻发生了急速的变化。“噢，瓦朗蒂娜，瓦朗蒂娜！”大声说道，“假如我的话里有什么使你感到痛苦，那就把它忘了吧。” “不，”她说道，“你说得没错，但你难道看不出我只是一个可怜虫吗？在家里受尽委曲，几乎就象一个陌生人一样。因为我父亲对我几乎就象一个陌生人。我的心早已碎了，自从我十岁那年起，每一天，每一小时，每一分钟，我都在忍受着那些铁石心肠般的压迫我的人折磨。谁都不了解我所受的痛苦，而除了你之外，我也不曾对别人讲过，外表上，在一般人的眼里，我的一切都很顺利，每个人对我都很体贴，但实际上，每个人都是我的仇敌。一般人都说：‘噢，象维尔福先生这样严厉的人，本来就是不能指望他会象某些父亲那样对女儿滥施温情的，但她也算是够幸福的了，竟能找到象维尔福夫人这样的一位继母。’但是，一般人都错了，我的父亲对我漠不关心，我的后母憎恨我，而由于她那种憎恨老是用微笑遮掩着，所以我就觉得更可怕了。” “恨你！你，瓦朗蒂娜！”青年大声说道，“谁会干得出这种事呢？” “唉！”瓦朗蒂娜说道，“我不得不承认，我后母厌恶我，起因是非常自然的，因为他太爱她自己的孩子了，就是我的弟弟爱德华。” “那怎么可能呢？” “怎么可能？本来我似乎不应该和你谈金钱上的事情，但是，我的朋友，我认为她对我的憎恨正是从那一点上引起来的。她没有什么财产，而我却已经很有钱了，因为我是我母亲的继承人，而且我的财产将来还会增加一倍的，因为圣·梅朗先生和圣·梅朗夫人的财富将来总有一天也会传给我的。嗯，我想她是在嫉妒我。噢，我的上帝！假如我把那笔财产分一半给她，我就可以使我自己在维尔福先生家里的地位确确实实地象一个女儿在她父亲的家里一样了，而我当然会毫无疑义地那样做的！” “可怜的瓦朗蒂娜！” “我似乎觉得自己象被链子锁着般的生活，同时，我又很清楚自己很软弱，我甚至怕去挣断那捆绑住我的锁链，深恐我会因此而陷入极端无力和无助的境地。而且，我的父亲不会对那些违背了他的命令而不加以责罚的。他极不喜欢我，也会极不喜欢你的，甚至对国王也是如此。因为他过去的历史是无可指摘的，而他的地位又几乎是不可动摇的。噢，马西米兰，我向你保证，假如我不作挣扎，那全是因为在那场挣扎里，不但我，而且连你也要被压倒的。” “但是，瓦朗蒂娜，你为什么要绝望，而且把未来看得这样可怕呢？” “啊，我的朋友！因为这是我从过去的事情上判断出来的。” “可是你再想一想，严格地说，我虽够不上如你所称之为的门当户对，但我有许多理由觉得我和你的结合并不能完全说是高攀。法国现在已不再是注重门第观念的时代了，君主国的家庭已和帝国的家庭联姻，用长枪的贵族已和用炮筒的贵族阶层通婚。我是属于后者这个阶级的，我在陆军中的父亲是很有前途的，我的财产虽然不多，但却不受任何人的牵制，我的父亲在我们故乡里很受人尊敬，大家都认为他是位最可尊敬的商人。我说‘我们的’故乡，瓦朗蒂娜，因为你出生的地点离马赛也并不远。” “别再提马赛这个名字好吧，我求求你了，马西米兰，这个地名使我又想起了我的母亲，我那天使般的母亲啊，对我，对所有那些认识她的人来说，她真是死得太早啦。她在这个世界上照顾她孩子的时间虽短，但我至少希望，现在，当她那纯洁的灵魂在那幸福的地方飞翔的时候，她还能亲切怜悯地注视着她的孩子。啊，要是她还活着的话，我们就什么都不必怕啦，马西米兰，因为我可以把我们的爱情坦白地告诉她，而她一定会来帮助和保护我们的。” “我恐怕，瓦朗蒂娜，”她的爱人答道，“要是她还活着的话，我就决不会幸运地认识你了。那时你只会感到很幸福，而高高在上了。幸福的瓦朗蒂娜会根本瞧不起我的。” “马西米兰，现在你也变得残酷——哦，不公平啦，”瓦朗蒂娜大声说道，“但我很想知道一件事。” “什么事？”青年问道，他觉察到瓦朗蒂娜有些犹豫，象是不知道该怎么开口说似的。“告诉我，马西米兰，从前，在马赛的时候，你父亲和我父亲之间有没有发生过什么误会？” “据我所知没有，”青年答道，“除非，的确，由于他们是敌对党派的人，或许彼此有点不喜欢对方吧。你父亲，你也是知道的，是一个热心拥护波旁王朝的保皇党，而我父亲则是完全尽忠于皇帝的。他们之间不会再有任何其他争执的了。但你为什么要提出这个问题来呢，瓦朗蒂娜？” “我来告诉你吧，”青年女郎答道，“而且这事你本来也是应该知道的。但我必须从报上公开声明任命你为荣誉团军官的那一天讲起。那天我们都坐在我祖父诺瓦蒂埃先生的房间里，腾格拉尔先生也在那儿，你还记得腾格拉尔先生吗？不记得了吗，马西米兰？就是借马车给我的后母，差一顶点儿就把她和我的小弟弟一起摔死的那个银行家。别人都忙着在那儿讨论腾格拉尔小组的婚事，我在高声读报纸给我祖父听，但当我读到有关你的那一段的时候，尽管那天早晨我没有做过别的什么事情，只是把那一段消息翻来复去地读给我自己听（你知道，这个消息你已经在前一天傍晚就告诉过我了），我感到这样的快乐，但一想到当着这么多人的面前把你——我的爱人的名字念出来，我就又觉得很慌张，我真的很想把那一段跳过去，可是又怕我的沉默会引起别人的怀疑所以我鼓起所有的勇气，尽可能的把它坚定沉着地念了出来。” “可爱的瓦朗蒂娜！” “嗯，我父亲一听到你的名字，就很快地转过头来。我相信——你瞧我多傻——每个人听到你的名字都会象被一个霹雳击中似的大吃一惊的，所以我好象看到我父亲吃了一惊，甚至连腾格拉尔先生也吃了一惊，但那当然只是一种幻觉而已。” “‘莫雷尔！莫雷尔！’我父亲大声说道，‘停一下，’然后，他紧锁眉头，又说道‘马赛有一家姓莫雷尔的，那都是些拿破仑党分子，他们在一八一五年的时候给我们添了不少麻烦，难道这个人就是那家的后代吗？’” “‘我想，’腾格拉尔先生回答说，‘小姐所读的报纸上的那个人，就是以前那个船主的儿子。’” “真的！”马西米兰答道，“那么你父亲怎么说，瓦朗蒂娜？” “噢，太可怕了，我不敢讲。” “讲吧，没关系。”青年微笑着说道。 “‘啊，’我父亲还是皱着眉头说道，‘他们所崇拜的那位皇帝对待这些疯子的态度的确很合适，他把他们称作“炮灰”，这两个字形容得再准确不过了。我很高兴看到现政府正极力实施这个有益的政策，即使驻军守卫阿尔及利亚只是为了那个目的，即使那个政策要花很多钱，我也要向政府道贺。’” “这的确是一种恶毒的政策，”马西米兰说道，“但你不必为维尔福先生的那句话感到惭愧，亲爱的，因为我可以向你保证，我父亲在谈到政治的时候，其态度之激烈，并不亚于你父亲。‘哼，’他说道，‘皇帝做过许多好事，但他为什么不把法官和律师编成一个联队，把他们永远派到前线去呢？’你瞧，瓦朗蒂娜，若论及思想的温和谈吐的优雅，两党都是一样的，没什么差别。但检察官这样大大地发扬了一番党的精神以后，腾格拉尔先生又怎么说？” “噢，他笑了，是他所特有的那种阴险的微笑，我觉得这种笑很残忍，过了一会儿，他们站起身来走了。那时我才注意到我祖父很气愤。我必须告诉你，马西米兰，只有我一个人能看出那可怜的疯瘫老人的情绪。我怀疑当着他的面所谈的这一番话（因为谁都没有去注意他，可怜的人）已在他的脑子里激起了某种强烈的影响，因为，这是自然的罗，他是这样的挚爱皇帝，一向忠心耿耿地为他效劳，现在别人以这样轻蔑的态度谈论他，他听了当然要觉得痛苦。” “谈到诺瓦蒂埃先生，”马西米兰说道，“他是帝国时代鼎鼎有名的一位人物。是一位地位崇高的政治家，我不知道你晓不晓得，瓦朗蒂娜，在波旁王朝复辟的期间，每一次拿破仑党的叛变都是他领导的呢。” “噢，我常常听人悄悄地谈论这种事，我觉得这真是奇怪极了。父亲是一个拿破仑党，而儿子却是一个保皇党，究竟有什么理由要在党派和政治上发生这样古怪的差别呢？还是回过头来讲我的故事吧！我转过身去望着我的祖父，想问他为什么这么激动，他若有所思地望着我读的那份报纸。‘什么事呀，亲爱的祖父？’我问道。‘你高兴吗？’他给了我一个肯定的表示。‘是高兴我父亲刚才所说的话吗？’他作了一个否定的回答。‘也许你喜欢腾格拉尔先生所说的话是吗？’又是一个否定的表示。‘噢，那么，你是因为听到莫雷尔先生（我不敢说马西米兰），被任命为荣誉团的军官，所以才感到高兴的吗？’他点头表示了同意。你想想看，那可怜的老人并不认识你，可是却高兴听到你被任命为荣誉团军官的消息！尽管这或许是他无意识的举动，因为他们说，他正在退回到一种第二次童年时代！但我却因为他那个同意的表示而更加爱他了。” “真是不可思议，”马西米兰低声说道，“你父亲显然一提到我的名字就怀有憎恨？而你的祖父却正巧相反。这些巴黎人的爱和恨真是奇怪的东西！” “嘘！”瓦朗蒂娜突然惊叫道，“快躲起来！快快！有人来啦！” 马西米兰一下子跳进他的苜蓿花地里，开始用最无情的态度铲起野草来。 “小姐！小姐！”树丛后面有一个声音喊道。“夫人到处在找您呢，客厅里来客人啦。” “客人！”瓦朗蒂娜很焦急地问道，“是谁呀？” “一位大人物，一位亲王，这是他们告诉我的。是基督山伯爵阁下。” “我马上就来。”瓦朗蒂娜高声说话。 这个名字使铁门那边的那个人象触电似的吃了一惊，在他的耳朵里，瓦朗蒂娜的那一声“我就来了！”就象是一声离别的丧钟，象是预示着他们永远不能再见面了似的。 “咦，”马西米兰若有所思地靠在他的铲子把上说道，“基督山伯爵是怎么认识维尔福先生的呢？” ①巴雷穆斯和狄丝琵是古代巴比伦的一对情人。一次狄丝琵先到林中约会地点，突然附近跳出一只狮子来扑一头牛，她急忙逃走，惊惶中遗落了外衣，外衣上染满了牛血。巴雷穆斯来的时候，只见血衣不见人，以为她被狮子咬死，就拔刀自杀了。后来狄丝琵再回来，看见巴雷穆斯已自杀，也就自杀殉情。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/72/3970.html","bookId":545,"book":{"id":545,"title":"The
