{"id":43901,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 37 The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian","content":"IN HIS whole life, perhaps, Franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression, so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness, as in this moment. It seemed as though Rome, under the magic breath of some demon of the night, had suddenly changed into a vast tomb. By a chance, which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness, the moon, which was on the wane, did not rise until eleven o\u0027clock, and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity. The distance was short, and at the end of ten minutes his carriage, or rather the count\u0027s, stopped before the H?tel de Londres. Dinner was waiting, but as Albert had told him that he should not return so soon, Franz sat down without him. Signor Pastrini, who had been accustomed to see them dine together, inquired into the cause of his absence, but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted. The sudden extinction of the moccoletti, the darkness which had replaced the light, and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil, had left in Franz\u0027s mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness. He therefore dined very silently, in spite of the officious attention of his host, who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything. \\n\\n Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible. He ordered the carriage, therefore, for eleven o\u0027clock, desiring Signor Pastrini to inform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel. At eleven o\u0027clock Albert had not come back. Franz dressed himself, and went out, telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the Duke of Bracciano\u0027s. The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of the most delightful in Rome, the duchess, one of the last heiresses of the Colonnas, does its honors with the most consummate grace, and thus their fetes have a European celebrity. Franz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them, and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion. Franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli, and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Macello. \"Then he has not returned?\" said the duke. \\n\\n \"I waited for him until this hour,\" replied Franz. \"And do you know whither he went?\" \\n\\n \"No, not precisely; however, I think it was something very like a rendezvous.\" \\n\\n \"Diavolo!\" said the duke, \"this is a bad day, or rather a bad night, to be out late; is it not, countess!\" These words were addressed to the Countess G----, who had just arrived, and was leaning on the arm of Signor Torlonia, the duke\u0027s brother. \\n\\n \"I think, on the contrary, that it is a charming night,\" replied the countess, \"and those who are here will complain of but one thing--its too rapid flight.\" \\n\\n \"I am not speaking,\" said the duke with a smile, \"of the persons who are here; the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you, and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely; I meant persons who were out in the streets of Rome.\" \\n\\n \"Ah,\" asked the countess, \"who is out in the streets of Rome at this hour, unless it be to go to a ball?\" \\n\\n \"Our friend, Albert de Morcerf, countess, whom I left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o\u0027clock this evening,\" said Franz, \"and whom I have not seen since.\" \\n\\n \"And don\u0027t you know where he is?\" \\n\\n \"Not at all.\" \\n\\n \"Is he armed?\" \\n\\n \"He is in masquerade.\" \\n\\n \"You should not have allowed him to go,\" said the duke to Franz; \"you, who know Rome better than he does.\" \\n\\n \"You might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi, who gained the prize in the race to-day,\" replied Franz; \"and then moreover, what could happen to him?\" \\n\\n \"Who can tell? The night is gloomy, and the Tiber is very near the Via Macello.\" Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude. \"I informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the night here, duke,\" said Franz, \"and desired them to come and inform me of his return.\" \\n\\n \"Ah,\" replied the duke, \"here I think, is one of my servants who is seeking you.\" \\n\\n The duke was not mistaken; when he saw Franz, the servant came up to him. \"Your excellency,\" he said, \"the master of the H?tel de Londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the Viscount of Morcerf.\" \\n\\n \"A letter from the viscount!\" exclaimed Franz. \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"And who is the man?\" \\n\\n \"I do not know.\" \\n\\n \"Why did he not bring it to me here?\" \\n\\n \"The messenger did not say.\" \\n\\n \"And where is the messenger?\" \\n\\n \"He went away directly he saw me enter the ball-room to find you.\" \\n\\n \"Oh,\" said the countess to Franz, \"go with all speed--poor young man! Perhaps some accident has happened to him.\" \\n\\n \"I will hasten,\" replied Franz. \\n\\n \"Shall we see you again to give us any information?\" inquired the countess. \\n\\n \"Yes, if it is not any serious affair, otherwise I cannot answer as to what I may do myself.\" \\n\\n \"Be prudent, in any event,\" said the countess. \\n\\n \"Oh, pray be assured of that.\" Franz took his hat and went away in haste. He had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o\u0027clock; fortunately the Palazzo Bracciano, which is on one side in the Corso, and on the other in the Square of the Holy Apostles, is hardly ten minutes\u0027 walk from the H?tel de Londres. As he came near the hotel, Franz saw a man in the middle of the street. He had no doubt that it was the messenger from Albert. The man was wrapped up in a large cloak. He went up to him, but, to his extreme astonishment, the stranger first addressed him. \"What wants your excellency of me?\" inquired the man, retreating a step or two, as if to keep on his guard. \\n\\n \"Are not you the person who brought me a letter,\" inquired Franz, \"from the Viscount of Morcerf?\" \\n\\n \"Your excellency lodges at Pastrini\u0027s hotel?\" \\n\\n \"I do.\" \\n\\n \"Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount?\" \\n\\n \"I am.\" \\n\\n \"Your excellency\u0027s name\"-- \\n\\n \"Is the Baron Franz d\u0027Epinay.\" \\n\\n \"Then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed.\" \\n\\n \"Is there any answer?\" inquired Franz, taking the letter from him. \\n\\n \"Yes--your friend at least hopes so.\" \\n\\n \"Come up-stairs with me, and I will give it to you.\" \\n\\n \"I prefer waiting here,\" said the messenger, with a smile. \\n\\n \"And why?\" \\n\\n \"Your excellency will know when you have read the letter.\" \\n\\n \"Shall I find you here, then?\" \\n\\n \"Certainly.\" \\n\\n Franz entered the hotel. On the staircase he met Signor Pastrini. \"Well?\" said the landlord. \\n\\n \"Well--what?\" responded Franz. \\n\\n \"You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend?\" he asked of Franz. \\n\\n \"Yes, I have seen him,\" he replied, \"and he has handed this letter to me. Light the candles in my apartment, if you please.\" The inn-keeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light. The young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed, and this had only made him the more anxious to read Albert\u0027s letter; and so he went instantly towards the waxlight, and unfolded it. It was written and signed by Albert. Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained. It was thus worded:-- \\n\\n My Dear Fellow,--The moment you have received this, have the kindness to take the letter of credit from my pocket-book, which you will find in the square drawer of the secretary; add your own to it, if it be not sufficient. Run to Torlonia, draw from him instantly four thousand piastres, and give them to the bearer. It is urgent that I should have this money without delay. I do not say more, relying on you as you may rely on me. Your friend, \\n\\n ALBERT DE MORCERF. \\n\\n P.S.--I now believe in Italian banditti. \\n\\n Below these lines were written, in a strange hand, the following in Italian:-- \\n\\n Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mile piastre non sono nelle mie mani, alla sette il conte Alberto avra cessato di vivere. \\n\\n LUIGI VAMPA. \\n\\n \"If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands, by seven o\u0027clock the Count Albert will have ceased to live.\" \\n\\n This second signature explained everything to Franz, who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment; the street was safer for him. Albert, then, had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief, in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe. There was no time to lose. He hastened to open the secretary, and found the pocket-book in the drawer, and in it the letter of credit. There were in all six thousand piastres, but of these six thousand Albert had already expended three thousand. As to Franz, he had no letter of credit, as he lived at Florence, and had only come to Rome to pass seven or eight days; he had brought but a hundred louis, and of these he had not more than fifty left. Thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert required. True, he might in such a case rely on the kindness of Signor Torlonia. He was, therefore, about to return to the Palazzo Bracciano without loss of time, when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind. He remembered the Count of Monte Cristo. Franz was about to ring for Signor Pastrini, when that worthy presented himself. \"My dear sir,\" he said, hastily, \"do you know if the count is within?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, your excellency; he has this moment returned.\" \\n\\n \"Is he in bed?\" \\n\\n \"I should say no.\" \\n\\n \"Then ring at his door, if you please, and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience.\" Signor Pastrini did as he was desired, and returning five minutes after, he said,--\"The count awaits your excellency.\" Franz went along the corridor, and a servant introduced him to the count. He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen, and which was surrounded with divans. The count came towards him. \"Well, what good wind blows you hither at this hour?\" said he; \"have you come to sup with me? It would be very kind of you.\" \\n\\n \"No; I have come to speak to you of a very serious matter.\" \\n\\n \"A serious matter,\" said the count, looking at Franz with the earnestness usual to him; \"and what may it be?\" \\n\\n \"Are we alone?\" \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied the count, going to the door, and returning. Franz gave him Albert\u0027s letter. \"Read that,\" he said. The count read it. \\n\\n \"Well, well!\" said he. \\n\\n \"Did you see the postscript?\" \\n\\n \"I did, indeed. \\n\\n \"\u0027Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mile piastre non sono nelle mie mani, alla sette il conte Alberto avra cessato di vivere. \\n\\n \"\u0027LUIGI VAMPA.\u0027\" \\n\\n \"What think you of that?\" inquired Franz. \\n\\n \"Have you the money he demands?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, all but eight hundred piastres.\" The count went to his secretary, opened it, and pulling out a drawer filled with gold, said to Franz,--\"I hope you will not offend me by applying to any one but myself.\" \\n\\n \"You see, on the contrary, I come to you first and instantly,\" replied Franz. \\n\\n \"And I thank you; have what you will; \"and he made a sign to Franz to take what he pleased. \\n\\n \"Is it absolutely necessary, then, to send the money to Luigi Vampa?\" asked the young man, looking fixedly in his turn at the count. \\n\\n \"Judge for yourself,\" replied he. \"The postscript is explicit.\" \\n\\n \"I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting, you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation,\" said Franz. \\n\\n \"How so?\" returned the count, with surprise. \\n\\n \"If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa, I am sure he would not refuse you Albert\u0027s freedom.\" \\n\\n \"What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?\" \\n\\n \"Have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten?\" \\n\\n \"What is that?\" \\n\\n \"Have you not saved Peppino\u0027s life?\" \\n\\n \"Well, well, said the count, \"who told you that?\" \\n\\n \"No matter; I know it.\" The count knit his brows, and remained silent an instant. \"And if I went to seek Vampa, would you accompany me?\" \\n\\n \"If my society would not be disagreeable.\" \\n\\n \"Be it so. It is a lovely night, and a walk without Rome will do us both good.\" \\n\\n \"Shall I take any arms?\" \\n\\n \"For what purpose?\" \\n\\n \"Any money?\" \\n\\n \"It is useless. Where is the man who brought the letter?\" \\n\\n \"In the street.\" \\n\\n \"He awaits the answer?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"I must learn where we are going. I will summon him hither.\" \\n\\n \"It is useless; he would not come up.\" \\n\\n \"To your apartments, perhaps; but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine.\" The count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street, and whistled in a peculiar manner. The man in the mantle quitted the wall, and advanced into the middle of the street. \\n\\n \"Salite!\" said the count, in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant. The messenger obeyed without the least hesitation, but rather with alacrity, and, mounting the steps at a bound, entered the hotel; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room. \\n\\n \"Ah, it is you, Peppino,\" said the count. \\n\\n But Peppino, instead of answering, threw himself on his knees, seized the count\u0027s hand, and covered it with kisses. \\n\\n \"Ah,\" said the count, \"you have, then, not forgotten that I saved your life; that is strange, for it is a week ago.\" \\n\\n \"No, excellency; and never shall I forget it,\" returned Peppino, with an accent of profound gratitude. \\n\\n \"Never? That is a long time; but it is something that you believe so. Rise and answer.\" Peppino glanced anxiously at Franz. \"Oh, you may speak before his excellency,\" said he; \"he is one of my friends. You allow me to give you this title?\" continued the count in French, \"it is necessary to excite this man\u0027s confidence.\" \\n\\n \"You can speak before me,\" said Franz; \"I am a friend of the count\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \"Good!\" returned Peppino. \"I am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me.\" \\n\\n \"How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigi\u0027s hands?\" \\n\\n \"Excellency, the Frenchman\u0027s carriage passed several times the one in which was Teresa.\" \\n\\n \"The chief\u0027s mistress?\" \\n\\n \"Yes. The Frenchman threw her a bouquet; Teresa returned it--all this with the consent of the chief, who was in the carriage.\" \\n\\n \"What?\" cried Franz, \"was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman peasants?\" \\n\\n \"It was he who drove, disguised as the coachman,\" replied Peppino. \\n\\n \"Well?\" said the count. \\n\\n \"Well, then, the Frenchman took off his mask; Teresa, with the chief\u0027s consent, did the same. The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous; Teresa gave him one--only, instead of Teresa, it was Beppo who was on the steps of the church of San Giacomo.\" \\n\\n \"What!\" exclaimed Franz, \"the peasant girl who snatched his moccoletto from him\"-- \\n\\n \"Was a lad of fifteen,\" replied Peppino. \"But it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived; Beppo has taken in plenty of others.\" \\n\\n \"And Beppo led him outside the walls?\" said the count. \\n\\n \"Exactly so; a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Macello. Beppo got in, inviting the Frenchman to follow him, and he did not wait to be asked twice. He gallantly offered the right-hand seat to Beppo, and sat by him. Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from Rome; the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world. The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paola; and when they were two hundred yards outside, as the Frenchman became somewhat too forward, Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head, the coachman pulled up and did the same. At the same time, four of the band, who were concealed on the banks of the Almo, surrounded the carriage. The Frenchman made some resistance, and nearly strangled Beppo; but he could not resist five armed men, and was forced to yield. They made him get out, walk along the banks of the river, and then brought him to Teresa and Luigi, who were waiting for him in the catacombs of St. Sebastian.\" \\n\\n \"Well,\" said the count, turning towards Franz, \"it seems to me that this is a very likely story. What do you say to it?\" \\n\\n \"Why, that I should think it very amusing,\" replied Franz, \"if it had happened to any one but poor Albert.\" \\n\\n \"And, in truth, if you had not found me here,\" said the count, \"it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear; but now, be assured, his alarm will be the only serious consequence.\" \\n\\n \"And shall we go and find him?\" inquired Franz. \\n\\n \"Oh, decidedly, sir. He is in a very picturesque place--do you know the catacombs of St. Sebastian?\" \\n\\n \"I was never in them; but I have often resolved to visit them.\" \\n\\n \"Well, here is an opportunity made to your hand, and it would be difficult to contrive a better. Have you a carriage?\" \\n\\n \"No.\" \\n\\n \"That is of no consequence; I always have one ready, day and night.\" \\n\\n \"Always ready?\" \\n\\n \"Yes. I am a very capricious being, and I should tell you that sometimes when I rise, or after my dinner, or in the middle of the night, I resolve on starting for some particular point, and away I go.\" The count rang, and a footman appeared. \"Order out the carriage,\" he said, \"and remove the pistols which are in the holsters. You need not awaken the coachman; Ali will drive.\" In a very short time the noise of wheels was heard, and the carriage stopped at the door. The count took out his watch. \"Half-past twelve,\" he said. \"We might start at five o\u0027clock and be in time, but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night, and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels. Are you still resolved to accompany me?\" \\n\\n \"More determined than ever.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then, come along.\" \\n\\n Franz and the count went downstairs, accompanied by Peppino. At the door they found the carriage. Ali was on the box, in whom Franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo. Franz and the count got into the carriage. Peppino placed himself beside Ali, and they set off at a rapid pace. Ali had received his instructions, and went down the Corso, crossed the Campo Vaccino, went up the Strada San Gregorio, and reached the gates of St. Sebastian. Then the porter raised some difficulties, but the Count of Monte Cristo produced a permit from the governor of Rome, allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night; the portcullis was therefore raised, the porter had a louis for his trouble, and they went on their way. The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way, and bordered with tombs. From time to time, by the light of the moon, which began to rise, Franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins, and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from Peppino. A short time before they reached the Baths of Caracalla the carriage stopped, Peppino opened the door, and the count and Franz alighted. \\n\\n \"In ten minutes,\" said the count to his companion, \"we shall be there.\" \\n\\n He then took Peppino aside, gave him an order in a low voice, and Peppino went away, taking with him a torch, brought with them in the carriage. Five minutes elapsed, during which Franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the Campagna; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage, which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion. \"Now,\" said the count, \"let us follow him.\" Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path, which, at the distance of a hundred paces, led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley. They then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity. \"Ought we to go on?\" asked Franz of the count; \"or shall we wait awhile?\" \\n\\n \"Let us go on; Peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming.\" One of the two men was Peppino, and the other a bandit on the lookout. Franz and the count advanced, and the bandit saluted them. \"Your excellency,\" said Peppino, addressing the count, \"if you will follow me, the opening of the catacombs is close at hand.\" \\n\\n \"Go on, then,\" replied the count. They came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks, by which a man could scarcely pass. Peppino glided first into this crevice; after they got along a few paces the passage widened. Peppino passed, lighted his torch, and turned to see if they came after him. The count first reached an open space and Franz followed him closely. The passageway sloped in a gentle descent, enlarging as they proceeded; still Franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture, and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another. They went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way, and then were stopped by, \"Who comes there?\" At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel. \\n\\n \"A friend!\" responded Peppino; and, advancing alone towards the sentry, he said a few words to him in a low tone; and then he, like the first, saluted the nocturnal visitors, making a sign that they might proceed. \\n\\n Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps. Franz and the count descended these, and found themselves in a mortuary chamber. Five corridors diverged like the rays of a star, and the walls, dug into niches, which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins, showed that they were at last in the catacombs. Down one of the corridors, whose extent it was impossible to determine, rays of light were visible. The count laid his hand on Franz\u0027s shoulder. \"Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose?\" he inquired. \\n\\n \"Exceedingly,\" replied Franz. \\n\\n \"Come with me, then. Peppino, put out the torch.\" Peppino obeyed, and Franz and the count were in utter darkness, except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare, more evident since Peppino had put out his torch, was visible along the wall. They advanced silently, the count guiding Franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark. Franz himself, however, saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light, which served in some manner as a guide. Three arcades were before them, and the middle one was used as a door. These arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz were, and on the other into a large square chamber, entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken. In the midst of this chamber were four stones, which had formerly served as an altar, as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them. A lamp, placed at the base of a pillar, lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow. A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column, and was reading with his back turned to the arcades, through the openings of which the newcomers contemplated him. This was the chief of the band, Luigi Vampa. Around him, and in groups, according to their fancy, lying in their mantles, or with their backs against a sort of stone bench, which went all round the columbarium, were to be seen twenty brigands or more, each having his carbine within reach. At the other end, silent, scarcely visible, and like a shadow, was a sentinel, who was walking up and down before a grotto, which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere. When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau, he raised his finger to his lips, to warn him to be silent, and, ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium, entered the chamber by the middle arcade, and advanced towards Vampa, who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps. \\n\\n \"Who comes there?\" cried the sentinel, who was less abstracted, and who saw by the lamp-light a shadow approaching his chief. At this challenge, Vampa rose quickly, drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle. In a moment all the bandits were on their feet, and twenty carbines were levelled at the count. \"Well,\" said he in a voice perfectly calm, and no muscle of his countenance disturbed, \"well, my dear Vampa, it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony.\" \\n\\n \"Ground arms,\" exclaimed the chief, with an imperative sign of the hand, while with the other he took off his hat respectfully; then, turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene, he said, \"Your pardon, your excellency, but I was so far from expecting the honor of a visit, that I did not really recognize you.\" \\n\\n \"It seems that your memory is equally short in everything, Vampa,\" said the count, \"and that not only do you forget people\u0027s faces, but also the conditions you make with them.\" \\n\\n \"What conditions have I forgotten, your excellency?\" inquired the bandit, with the air of a man who, having committed an error, is anxious to repair it. \\n\\n \"Was it not agreed,\" asked the count, \"that not only my person, but also that of my friends, should be respected by you?\" \\n\\n \"And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?\" \\n\\n \"You have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf. Well,\" continued the count, in a tone that made Franz shudder, \"this young gentleman is one of my friends--this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself--this young gentleman has been up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage, and yet, I repeat to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed him hither, and,\" added the count, taking the letter from his pocket, \"you have set a ransom on him, as if he were an utter stranger.\" \\n\\n \"Why did you not tell me all this--you?\" inquired the brigand chief, turning towards his men, who all retreated before his look. \"Why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count, who has all our lives in his hands? By heavens, if I thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency, I would blow his brains out with my own hand!\" \\n\\n \"Well,\" said the count, turning towards Franz, \"I told you there was some mistake in this.\" \\n\\n \"Are you not alone?\" asked Vampa with uneasiness. \\n\\n \"I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed, and to whom I desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word. Come, your excellency,\" the count added, turning to Franz, \"here is Luigi Vampa, who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed.\" Franz approached, the chief advancing several steps to meet him. \"Welcome among us, your excellency,\" he said to him; \"you heard what the count just said, and also my reply; let me add that I would not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friend\u0027s ransom, that this had happened.\" \\n\\n \"But,\" said Franz, looking round him uneasily, \"where is the Viscount?--I do not see him.\" \\n\\n \"Nothing has happened to him, I hope,\" said the count frowningly. \\n\\n \"The prisoner is there,\" replied Vampa, pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard, \"and I will go myself and tell him he is free.\" The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Albert\u0027s prison, and Franz and the count followed him. \"What is the prisoner doing?\" inquired Vampa of the sentinel. \\n\\n \"Ma foi, captain,\" replied the sentry, \"I do not know; for the last hour I have not heard him stir.\" \\n\\n \"Come in, your excellency,\" said Vampa. The count and Franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief, who drew back a bolt and opened a door. Then, by the gleam of a lamp, similar to that which lighted the columbarium, Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him, lying in a corner in profound slumber. \"Come,\" said the count, smiling with his own peculiar smile, \"not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven o\u0027clock to-morrow morning.\" Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration; he was not insensible to such a proof of courage. \\n\\n \"You are right, your excellency,\" he said; \"this must be one of your friends.\" Then going to Albert, he touched him on the shoulder, saying, \"Will your excellency please to awaken?\" Albert stretched out his arms, rubbed his eyelids, and opened his eyes. \"Oh,\" said he, \"is it you, captain? You should have allowed me to sleep. I had such a delightful dream. I was dancing the galop at Torlonia\u0027s with the Countess G----.\" Then he drew his watch from his pocket, that he might see how time sped. \\n\\n \"Half-past one only?\" said he. \"Why the devil do you rouse me at this hour?\" \\n\\n \"To tell you that you are free, your excellency.\" \\n\\n \"My dear fellow,\" replied Albert, with perfect ease of mind, \"remember, for the future, Napoleon\u0027s maxim, \u0027Never awaken me but for bad news;\u0027 if you had let me sleep on, I should have finished my galop, and have been grateful to you all my life. So, then, they have paid my ransom?\" \\n\\n \"No, your excellency.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then, how am I free?\" \\n\\n \"A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you.\" \\n\\n \"Come hither?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, hither.\" \\n\\n \"Really? Then that person is a most amiable person.\" Albert looked around and perceived Franz. \"What,\" said he, \"is it you, my dear Franz, whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed?\" \\n\\n \"No, not I,\" replied Franz, \"but our neighbor, the Count of Monte Cristo.\" \\n\\n \"Oh. my dear count.\" said Albert gayly, arranging his cravat and wristbands, \"you are really most kind, and I hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you, in the first place for the carriage, and in the next for this visit,\" and he put out his hand to the Count, who shuddered as he gave his own, but who nevertheless did give it. The bandit gazed on this scene with amazement; he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him, and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered; as for Franz, he was enchanted at the way in which Albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit. \"My dear Albert,\" he said, \"if you will make haste, we shall yet have time to finish the night at Torlonia\u0027s. You may conclude your interrupted galop, so that you will owe no ill-will to Signor Luigi, who has, indeed, throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman.\" \\n\\n \"You are decidedly right, and we may reach the Palazzo by two o\u0027clock. Signor Luigi,\" continued Albert, \"is there any formality to fulfil before I take leave of your excellency?\" \\n\\n \"None, sir,\" replied the bandit, \"you are as free as air.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then, a happy and merry life to you. Come, gentlemen, come.\" \\n\\n And Albert, followed by Franz and the count, descended the staircase, crossed the square chamber, where stood all the bandits, hat in hand. \"Peppino,\" said the brigand chief, \"give me the torch.\" \\n\\n \"What are you going to do?\" inquired the count. \\n\\n \"l will show you the way back myself,\" said the captain; \"that is the least honor that I can render to your excellency.\" And taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman, he preceded his guests, not as a servant who performs an act of civility, but like a king who precedes ambassadors. On reaching the door, he bowed. \"And now, your excellency,\" added he, \"allow me to repeat my apologies, and I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred.\" \\n\\n \"No, my dear Vampa,\" replied the count; \"besides, you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way, that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them.\" \\n\\n \"Gentlemen,\" added the chief, turning towards the young men, \"perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you; but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit, wherever I may be, you shall be welcome.\" Franz and Albert bowed. The count went out first, then Albert. Franz paused for a moment. \"Has your excellency anything to ask me?\" said Vampa with a smile. \\n\\n \"Yes, I have,\" replied Franz; \"I am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered.\" \\n\\n \"C?sar\u0027s Commentaries,\" said the bandit, \"it is my favorite work.\" \\n\\n \"Well, are you coming?\" asked Albert. \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied Franz, \"here I am,\" and he, in his turn, left the caves. They advanced to the plain. \"Ah, your pardon,\" said Albert, turning round; \"will you allow me, captain?\" And he lighted his cigar at Vampa\u0027s torch. \"Now, my dear count,\" he said, \"let us on with all the speed we may. I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Bracciano\u0027s.\" \\n\\n They found the carriage where they had left it. The count said a word in Arabic to Ali, and the horses went on at great speed. It was just two o\u0027clock by Albert\u0027s watch when the two friends entered into the dancing-room. Their return was quite an event, but as they entered together, all uneasiness on Albert\u0027s account ceased instantly. \\n\\n \"Madame,\" said the Viscount of Morcerf, advancing towards the countess, \"yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop; I am rather late in claiming this gracious promise, but here is my friend, whose character for veracity you well know, and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine.\" \\n\\n 在他一生中，弗兰兹也许从来没有过这样突兀的一个印象，从没经验过象目前这样从欢乐到悲哀的急速转变。似乎整个罗马，在一个夜游神的一口魔气之下，突然变成了一座大坟墓，刚好时逢月缺，月亮要到十一点钟才会升起来，这就更增加了黑暗的浓度。这个青年人所经过的街道，都被包围在深深的阴暗里。路途原是很短的，十分钟以后，他的马车，更确切地说，伯爵的马车，已在伦敦旅馆门前停了下来。晚餐已准备好了，由于阿尔贝已说过，他不会很快就回来的，所以弗兰兹也就不等他了，独自一个人在餐桌前坐了下来。派里尼老板一向总是看到他们一同用餐的，于是便问他阿尔贝为什么不在，弗兰慈回答说，阿尔贝昨天晚上接到一张请帖，赴宴去了。长生烛的突然熄灭，接替光明的黑暗，和那继骚闹喧嚣而来的沉寂，都在弗兰兹的头脑里留下了某种不安的抑郁之感。所以，尽管店主向他表示过分殷勤的关切，并几次三番亲自来问他还需要什么，他用餐的时候还是非常沉静。 \\n\\n 弗兰兹决定尽可能的等一等阿尔贝。吩咐马车在十一点钟的时候准备好，并希望到那时派里尼老板来通报说阿尔贝回来了。到了十一点钟，阿尔贝仍没有回来。弗兰兹就穿上衣服出去了。告诉店主说他到勃拉西诺公爵府去了，今晚不回来了。勃拉西诺公爵府是罗马最令人愉快的家庭之一，他的夫人是哥伦纳斯王国最后一支的继承人之一，她把公爵府布置得十分雅致优美，他们的宴会是在全欧洲闻名的。弗兰兹和阿尔贝曾带着介绍信来拜会过他们，所以弗兰兹一到，第一个问题便是他的同伴到哪儿去了。弗兰兹回答说，他是在长生烛快熄灭的时候离开他的，后来就混到玛西罗街的人群里不见了。 \\n\\n “那么他还没有回来吗？”公爵问。 \\n\\n “我一直等他到现在。”弗兰兹答道。 \\n\\n “您不知道他去哪儿吗？” \\n\\n “不，不十分清楚，但，我想大概是去赴幽会了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n “见鬼！”公爵说道，“今天这样的日子，或说得更确切些，在今晚上，深夜出门，实在是很不妙的呀，是不是，伯爵夫人？” \\n\\n 这几句话是对Ｇ伯爵夫人说的，她刚刚到，正倚着公爵的弟弟托洛尼亚先生的肩膀走过来。 \\n\\n “恰恰相反，我认为今天晚上很有趣，”伯爵夫人答道，“这儿的人只恨一件事——恨夜晚过得太快。” \\n\\n “我不是说这儿的人。”公爵微笑着说道，“这儿唯一的危险在于男人，他们爱上了您，而在于女人，她们看到您这样可爱就不免妒嫉生气。我是指那些在罗马街上奔波的人而言。” \\n\\n “啊！”伯爵夫人问道，“这个时候谁还会在罗马街道上奔波，除非是去赴舞会的？” \\n\\n “伯爵夫人，我们那位朋友阿尔贝·马尔塞夫，今天晚上七点钟左右离开了我，追他那位无名美人去了，”弗兰兹说道，“直到现在我还没看见他。” \\n\\n “您不知道他在哪儿吗？” \\n\\n “一点都不知道。” \\n\\n “他有没有带武器去？” \\n\\n “他是穿着小丑的服装去的。” \\n\\n “您不该让他去的，”公爵对弗兰兹说道，“您对于罗马的情况知道得比他清楚的多呀。” \\n\\n “想要他不去，就等于要拉住今天赛马夺标的那匹三号马，”弗兰兹说道，“而且，他会有什么危险呢？” \\n\\n “那谁敢说？今天晚上天色很阴沉，而玛西罗街离狄伯门又非常近。” \\n\\n 弗兰兹看到公爵和伯爵夫人的感觉和他自己的焦虑这样一致，就觉得一阵寒颤透过了他的全身。“公爵，我曾告诉旅馆里的人，说我今天很荣幸能在这儿过夜，”弗兰兹说，“我叫他们等他一回来就来通知我。” \\n\\n “啊！”公爵答道，“我想，我这个仆人大概是来找您的。” \\n\\n 公爵没有猜错，因为那个仆人一看见弗兰兹，就向他走过来。“大人，”他说道，“伦敦旅馆的老板派人来禀告您，说有一个给马尔塞夫子爵送信的人在那儿等您。” \\n\\n “给马尔塞夫子爵送信的！”弗兰兹惊叫道。 \\n\\n “是的。” \\n\\n “那人是谁？” \\n\\n “我不知道。” \\n\\n “他为什么不把信给我送到这儿来？” \\n\\n “那个信差没有说。” \\n\\n “信差在哪儿？” \\n\\n “他一看到我进舞厅来找您，就马上走了。” \\n\\n “噢！”伯爵夫人对弗兰兹说，“赶快去吧！可怜的小伙子！或许他遇到什么意外了吧。” \\n\\n “我得赶紧去。”弗兰兹答道。 \\n\\n “要是事情并不严重，我会回来的，不然的话，我自己也不知道我该做些什么呢。” \\n\\n “不管发生什么事，要慎重呀。”伯爵夫人说道。 \\n\\n “噢！放心好了。” \\n\\n 弗兰兹拿起他的帽子，急忙走了出去。他已经把他的马车打发走了，原吩咐叫他们在两点钟来接他的。幸亏勃拉西诺府一边靠高碌街，一边临圣·阿彼得广场，离伦敦旅馆不到十分钟的路。当弗兰兹走近旅馆的时候，他看见有一个人正站在街中心。他相信这一定是阿尔贝派来的信差。那个人全身裹在一件大披风里。弗兰兹向他走过去，但使他极其惊讶的是，那个人反而先向他开口了。“大人找我干吗？”他一边问，一边后退了一步，象是很戒备的样子。 \\n\\n “你是马尔塞夫子爵派来的送信给我的那个人吗？”弗兰兹问道。 \\n\\n “大人是住在派里尼的旅馆里的吗？” \\n\\n “是的。” \\n\\n “大人是子爵的同伴吗？” \\n\\n “不错。” \\n\\n “大人的尊称是——” \\n\\n “弗兰兹·伊皮奈男爵。” \\n\\n “那么这封信是送给大人的了。” \\n\\n “要不要回信？”弗兰兹一边从他手里接过那封信，一边问。 \\n\\n “要的，至少您的朋友希望如此。” \\n\\n “跟我上楼来吧，我写回信给你。” \\n\\n “我还是等在这儿的好。”那信差微笑着说。 \\n\\n “为什么？” \\n\\n “大人读了信就知道了。” \\n\\n “那么，我一会儿还能在这儿找到你吗？” \\n\\n “当然啦。” \\n\\n 弗兰兹往旅馆里走去。他在楼梯上遇到了派里尼老板。 \\n\\n “怎么样？”旅馆老板问。 \\n\\n “什么怎么样？”弗兰兹反问道。 \\n\\n “您见到您的朋友派来找您的那个人了吗？”他问弗兰兹。 \\n\\n “是的，我见到他了，”他答道。“他把这封信给了我。请把我房间里的蜡烛点上好吗？” \\n\\n 旅馆老板吩咐点一支蜡烛来拿到弗兰兹的房间里去。这个年轻人看到派里尼老板的神色非常惊惶，就更急于要看阿尔贝的来信，所以他立刻走到蜡烛前面，拆开了那封信。信是阿尔贝写的，底下有他的签名。弗兰兹读了两遍才明白信里的意思。 \\n\\n 信的内容如下： \\n\\n “我亲爱的朋友，收到此信时，务请劳神立刻在我的皮夹里找出那张汇票（皮夹子在写字台的大抽屉里），如数目不够，把你的也加上。赶快到托洛尼亚那儿，在他那儿当场点出四千毕阿士特，将款子交与来人。我急于要这笔钱，不能拖迟。我不多说了，一切信托你了，象你可以信托我一样。 \\n\\n ——你的朋友阿尔贝·马尔塞夫 \\n\\n 附笔我现在相信意大利的确有强盗了。” \\n\\n 在这几行字之下，还有两行笔迹陌生的意大利文：“那四千毕阿士特假如在早晨六点钟到不了我的手里，阿尔贝马尔塞夫子爵在七点钟就活不成了。——罗吉·万帕” \\n\\n 弗兰兹一看这第二个签名，就一切都明白了，他现在懂得那个信差为什么不肯到他的房间里来的原因了：街上对他要比较安全一些。这么说，阿尔贝是落在那个大名鼎鼎的强盗头子手里了，而那个强盗头子的存在是他一向拒绝相信的。不能再浪费时间了。他急忙打开写字台，从抽屉里拿出皮夹子，从皮夹子里拿出汇票，那张汇票的总数是六千毕阿士特；而在这六千之中，阿尔贝已花去了三千。至于弗兰兹，他根本没有汇票，因为他原住在佛罗伦萨，到罗马来只玩七八天的，他只带了一百路易来，现在剩下的已不足五十了。所以两个人的钱加起来，距阿尔贝所要的那笔数目还差七八百毕阿士特。不错，在这种情形之下，他相信托洛尼亚先生一定肯帮忙的。他不敢浪费时间，正想回到勃拉西诺府去，突然他的脑子里闪过了一个念头。他想起了基督山伯爵。弗兰兹正要拉铃叫派里尼老板，那可敬的人却自己来了。“我的好先生，”他急急地说，“你知道伯爵是否在家？” \\n\\n “在家，大人，他已经回来了。” \\n\\n “他上床了没有？” \\n\\n “我想还没有吧。” \\n\\n “那么请你去敲一下他的门，问他能不能见我一下。” \\n\\n 派里尼老板遵命而去，五分钟以后，他回来了，说：“伯爵恭候大人。” \\n\\n 弗兰兹顺着走廊走，一个仆人把他领到了伯爵那儿。他正在一间小书房里，这个房间四周都是靠背长椅，弗兰兹以前没见过，伯爵向他迎上来。“哦，是什么风把您在这个时候吹到这儿来了？”他说，“您是来和我一同用晚餐的吧？您真太赏脸了。” \\n\\n “不，我是来跟您谈一件非常严重的事情的。” \\n\\n “一件严重的事情！”伯爵说道，并带着他那一贯的真挚的态度望着弗兰兹，“是什么事？” \\n\\n “这儿只有我们两个人吗？” \\n\\n “是的。”伯爵回答，一面走到了门口去看了看又回来。弗兰兹把阿尔贝的那封信交给了他。 \\n\\n “您看一下这封信吧。”他说道。 \\n\\n 伯爵看了一遍。“哦，哦！”他说道。 \\n\\n “您看到那批注了吗？” \\n\\n “看到了，的确。” \\n\\n “那四千毕阿士特假如在早晨六点钟到不了我的手里，阿尔贝·马尔塞夫子爵在七点钟就活不成了。——罗吉·万帕’” \\n\\n “您觉得这件事该怎么办？”弗兰兹问道。 \\n\\n “您有没有他要的那笔钱？” \\n\\n “有，但还差八百毕阿士特。” \\n\\n 伯爵走到他的写字台前，打开一只满装金币的抽屉，对弗兰兹说：“我希望您不会不给面子抛开我而向别人去借钱。” \\n\\n “您瞧，恰恰相反，我第一个就立刻来找您了。” \\n\\n “为此我谢谢您，请您自己过去拿吧。”于是他向弗兰兹做了一个手势，表示随便他拿多少。 \\n\\n “那么，我们必需送钱给罗吉·万帕罗？”那青年人问道，这次轮到他来目不转眼地望着伯爵了。 \\n\\n “您自己决定吧，”他答道，“那批注说得很明白。” \\n\\n “我想，假如您肯劳神动一动脑筋，您可以想出一个办法来简化这一场谈判的。”弗兰兹说。 \\n\\n “怎么会呢？”伯爵带着惊奇的神色回答说。 \\n\\n “假如我们一同到罗吉·万帕那儿去，我相信他一定会答应您释放阿尔贝的。” \\n\\n “我有什么力量可以指使一个强盗呢？” \\n\\n “您不是才帮了他一次永世难忘的大忙吗？” \\n\\n “帮了什么忙？” \\n\\n “您不是才帮他救了庇皮诺的命吗？” \\n\\n “什么！”伯爵说道，“是谁告诉您的？” \\n\\n “别管了，我知道就是了。” \\n\\n 伯爵皱紧眉头沉默了一会儿。“假如我去找万帕，您肯陪我一起去吗？” \\n\\n “只要我同去不惹人讨厌的话。” \\n\\n “就这么办吧。今晚的夜色很美，在罗马郊外散一散步对我们都是很有益的。” \\n\\n “我要不要带什么武器去？” \\n\\n “带去做什么？” \\n\\n “钱呢？” \\n\\n “钱带去也没用。来送这封信的人在哪儿？” \\n\\n “在街上。” \\n\\n “他在等回信吗？” \\n\\n “是的。” \\n\\n “我必须先知道我们究竟要到哪儿去。我去叫他到这儿来。” \\n\\n “那是白费力的，他不会上来的。” \\n\\n “到您的房间或许不肯，但到我这儿来，他是不会为难的。” \\n\\n 伯爵走到面向街的窗口前面，怪声怪气地吹了一声口哨。 \\n\\n 那个穿披风的人就离开了墙壁，走到街中心来。“上来！”伯爵说道，他的语气就象吩咐他的仆人一样，那信差竟毫不犹豫地服从了这个命令，而且还显得很高兴的样子，他蹦蹦跳跳地奔上台阶，窜进了旅馆。五秒钟以后，他已出现在书房的门口了。 \\n\\n “啊，是你呀，庇皮诺。”伯爵说道。庇皮诺并没回答，只是扑身跪了下来，拿起伯爵的手，在手上印了无数个吻。 \\n\\n “啊，”伯爵说道，“这么说你还没有忘了是我救了你的命，这真奇怪，因为那是一星期以前的事了呀！” \\n\\n “不，大人，我是永远不会忘记的。”庇皮诺回答说，语气间流露出十分感激的样子。 \\n\\n “永远！那是一个很长的时间啊，你大概是这样相信的。起来吧。”庇皮诺不安地瞟了一眼弗兰兹。“噢，在这位大人面前，你尽说无妨，”伯爵说道，“他是我的朋友。您允许我给您这个头衔吗？”伯爵又用法语说道，“要想获得这个人的信任，必需这样做。” \\n\\n “你当着我的面说好了，”弗兰兹说道，“我是伯爵的朋友。” \\n\\n “好吧！”庇皮诺答道，“大人随便问我什么问题，我都可以回答。” \\n\\n “阿尔贝子爵是怎么落到罗吉手里的？” \\n\\n “大人，那个法国人的马车几次经过德丽莎所坐的那辆车子。” \\n\\n “就是首领的那位情人吗？” \\n\\n “是的。那个法国人抛了一个花球给她，德丽莎还了他一个，这是得到首领同意的，他当时也在车子里。” \\n\\n “什么！”弗兰兹不禁失声叫道，”罗吉·万帕也在罗马农民的那辆马车里？” \\n\\n “那赶车的就是他，他化装成了车夫。”庇皮诺答道。 \\n\\n “嗯？”伯爵说。 \\n\\n “嗯，后来，那个法国人摘下了他的面具，德丽莎，经首领的同意，也照样做了一次。那个法国人便要求和她见一次面，德丽莎答应了他，只是，等在圣·甲珂摩教堂台阶上的不是德丽莎，而是俾波。” \\n\\n “什么！”弗兰兹惊叫道，那个抢掉他长生烛的农家姑娘？” \\n\\n “是一个十五岁的男孩，”庇皮诺回答说。“您的朋友这次上当算不得什么丢脸，把俾波认错的人多得很呢。” \\n\\n “于是俾波就领他出了城，是不是？”伯爵问道。 \\n\\n “一点不错，一辆马车已等候在玛西罗街街尾。俾波钻进马车里，请那个法国人跟他来，那个法国人没等他请第二次就殷勤地把右手的座位让给了俾波，自己则坐在他的旁边。俾波告诉他说，他要带他到离罗马三哩外的一座别墅去。那个法国人向他保证说，就是要他跟到世界的尽头他都愿意去。车子经立庇得街出了圣·保罗门。当他们出了城的两百码以后，由于那个法国人未免多少有点过份了，所以俾波就摸出一支手枪顶住了他的脑袋。车夫勒住车子，也照样来了一套。同时，那躲在阿尔摩河岸边的两个队员也跳出来把马车围住了。那个法国人抵抗了一会儿，差一点勒死了俾波，但毕竟无法抗拒五个有武装的人，最后只能屈服了。他们把他拖出来，沿着河岸走，带他到了德丽莎和罗吉那儿，他们正在圣·塞巴斯蒂安的陵墓里等他呢。” \\n\\n “哦，”伯爵转过脸去对弗兰兹说，“依我看，这倒是一个非常动人的故事。您觉得怎么样？” \\n\\n “嘿，我会觉得这个故事非常有趣，”弗兰兹答道，“假如它的主角是别人而不是可怜的阿尔贝。” \\n\\n “老实说，假如您在这儿找不到我，”伯爵说，“这件风流艳遇可得使您的朋友大大地破费了。但现在，放心吧，他唯一严重的后果只是受一场虚惊而已。” \\n\\n “我们要不要亲自去找他？”弗兰兹问。 \\n\\n “噢，当然罗。他现在所在的地方风景非常优美。您知不知道圣·塞巴斯蒂安的陵墓？” \\n\\n “我从来没去过，但我总想去玩一次。” \\n\\n “好了，这是一个送上门来的机会，而且也很难再找到一个更好的时机了。您的马车在不在？” \\n\\n “不在。” \\n\\n “那没关系，我总不分昼夜准备着一辆的。” \\n\\n “总是准备着的？” \\n\\n “是呀。我是一个相当任性的人，我告诉您吧，有时候，我刚起身，或是用过午餐以后，或是在半夜里，我忽然决定要动身到某个地方去，于是我就去了。”伯爵拉了一下铃，一个跟班应声而至。“备车，”他说道，“把枪袋里的手枪取掉。不必叫醒车夫，叫阿里驾车好了。” \\n\\n 不一会儿就听到了车轮的声音，马车在门口停了来。伯爵掏出表来一看。“才十二点半，”他说。“我们本来可以在五点钟动身也来得及的，但去晚了会使您的朋友一夜不安的，所以我们还是赶快去把他从异教徒的手里救出来吧。您还是决心要陪我去吗？” \\n\\n “决心更大了。” \\n\\n “好，那么，走吧。” \\n\\n 弗兰兹和伯爵一同下了楼，庇皮诺在后面跟着他们。马车已停在了门口。阿里高踞在座位上，弗兰兹认出他就是基督山岩洞里的那个哑奴。弗兰兹和伯爵钻进车厢里。庇皮诺坐在了阿里的旁边，他们快步出发了。阿里已得到了指示，他驱车经高碌街横过凡西诺广场，穿到圣·格黎高里街，直达圣·塞巴斯蒂安门。到了那里，守城门的哨兵找了不少麻烦，但基督山伯爵拿出了一张罗马总督的特许证，凭证可以不管白天黑夜何时出城或入城都可以，所以铁格子的城门闸吊了上去，守城的哨兵得到一个路易作酬劳，于是他们继续前进了。马车现在所经过的路是古代的阿匹爱氏大道，两旁都是坟墓，月亮现在已开始升起来了，月光之下，弗兰兹好象时时看见一个哨兵从废墟中闪身出来，但庇皮诺一做手势，便又突然退回到黑暗里去了。快在到卡拉卡拉况技场的时候，马车停住了，庇皮诺打开车门，伯爵和弗兰兹跳下车来。 \\n\\n “十分钟之内，”伯爵对他的同伴说，“我们就可以看到那儿了。” \\n\\n 他把庇皮诺拉到一边，低声吩咐了他几句话，庇皮诺就拿着一支马车里带来的火把走开了。五分钟过去了，弗兰兹眼看着那个牧羊人顺着一条小径在罗马平原高低不平的地面上向前走，在长长的红色的牧草中消失了，那些牧草就象一只大狮子背颈上竖起的长毛。“现在，”伯爵说，“我们跟他走吧。”弗兰兹和伯爵也顺着这条小径向前走去，走了约一百步，他们就到了一片通到一个小谷底去的斜坡上。他们发觉有两个人正在阴影星谈话。 \\n\\n “我们应不应该再向前走了？”弗兰兹问伯爵，“还是停一停再说呢？” \\n\\n “我们还是继续向前走吧，庇皮诺大概已把我们要来的事通报了哨兵。” \\n\\n 那两个人之中一个正是庇皮诺，另外那个是一个望风的强盗。弗兰兹和伯爵向前走着，那个强盗向他们行了个礼。 \\n\\n “大人，”庇皮诺对伯爵说，“请跟我来，墓地就要到了。” \\n\\n “那么走吧。”伯爵答道。 \\n\\n 他们走到了一丛灌木后面，在一堆石块中间，有一个仅可容身的入口。庇皮诺第一个从这条石缝里钻了进去，但走了几步之后，地道就开阔起来了。然后他停下来，点着他的火把，转身看看他们有没有跟进来。伯爵先钻进了一个四方形的洞，弗兰兹紧跟着进来，这条狭径微向下倾，愈下愈宽；但弗兰兹和伯爵依旧不得不弯着腰前进，而且仅能容两个人并排走。他们就这样走了约一百多步，突然听到一声谁的喝声。他们立刻停了下来。同时在火把的反光之中，他们看到了一支马枪的枪筒。 \\n\\n “一个朋友！”庇皮诺应声回答，他独自向那个哨兵走去，向他低声说了几句什么话，于是象第一个哨兵一样，他也向两位午夜访客行了个礼，并做了一个手势，表示他们可以继续前进了。 \\n\\n 那个哨兵的后面有一座二十级的台阶。弗兰兹和伯爵拾级而下，发觉他们已站在了一个坟场的交叉路口。五条路象星星的光芒似的散射出去，墙壁上挖有棺材形的壁龛，这说明他们终于到了陵墓里面。有一处凹进去的地方非常深，看不见里面有什么光。伯爵用他的手扶着弗兰兹的肩头。“您想不想看一座在睡梦中的强盗营？” \\n\\n “当然罗。”弗兰兹回答说。 \\n\\n “那么，跟我来。庇皮诺，把火把弄灭了吧。” \\n\\n “庇皮诺遵命，于是，弗兰兹和伯爵突然陷入了无边的黑暗之中。但在他们前面五十步远的地方，墙上似乎有一种暗红色的光在抖动，自从庇皮诺把火把熄灭以后，那个光就看得比较清楚了。他们默默地前进着，伯爵扶着弗兰兹，好象他有一种奇特的本领似的，能在黑暗里看见东西。但弗兰兹自己也能把那光当作他的向导，而且愈向前走，也就愈看得清楚。他们的前面是三座连环的拱廊，中间那一座就成了出入口。这三座拱廊一面通到伯爵和弗兰兹来时的那条地道，一面通到一间四方形的大房间里，房间的四壁上布满了我们以前所说过的那种同样的壁龛。在这个房间的中央，有四块大石头，这显然以前是当祭坛用的，因为那个十字架依旧还在上面。廊柱脚下放着一盏灯，它那青白色的颤抖的光照亮了这一幕奇特的场面，把它呈现在这两位躲在阴影里的来客眼前。房间里坐着一个人，用手肘靠着廊柱，正在看书，他背向着拱廊，不知道有两位新来者正透过拱廊的门洞注视着他。这个人就是队里的首领罗吉·万帕。在他的四周，可以看到二十多个强盗，都裹在他们的披风里，横七竖八一堆堆地躺在地上，或用背靠着这墓穴四周的石凳。在房间里端，隐隐约约可以看到一个哨兵，默默地，象个幽灵似地，在一个洞口前面踱来踱去，至于何以能辨别出那里有一个洞口，是因为那个地方似乎更黑暗。当伯爵觉得弗兰兹已看够了这一幅生动的画面时，他就用手在嘴唇上按了按，示意他不要出声，然后走下那通入墓穴去的三级台阶，从中间的那座拱门进到了房间，向万帕走去，后者正看书看得出神，以致竟没听到他的脚步声。 \\n\\n “是谁？”哨兵可不象他的首领那样出神，他在灯光之下看到一个人影向他的首领走过去，就吆喝起来。听到这一声吆喝，万帕立刻站了起来，并同时从他的腰带里拔出了一支手枪。一霎时，所有的强盗都跳了起来，二十支马枪平举着对准了伯爵。“喂，”他说道，他的声音十分镇定，脸上的肌肉一点儿都不颤动，“喂，我亲爱的万帕，我看，你接待朋友的礼节倒很隆重呀！” \\n\\n “枪放下！”首领一边喊，一边作了一个威严的手势，并和其余那些人一样恭恭敬敬地摘下了他的帽子，然后转向造成这幕场面的那位奇人，说道，“请您恕罪，伯爵阁下，我因绝没想到大人的光临，所以才没有认出您来。” \\n\\n “你的记忆力在所有的事上似乎都同样的短暂，万帕，”伯爵说道，“你不但忘记了别人的脸，而且还忘记了你和他们互定的诺言。” \\n\\n “我忘记了什么诺言，伯爵阁下？”那强盗问道，神色很惊恐，象一个人做错了事急于想加以弥补的样子。 \\n\\n “我们不是约定，”伯爵说道，“不仅我个人，连我的朋友在内，你也应该加以尊敬的吗？” \\n\\n “我哪件事破坏了这个约定，大人？” \\n\\n “你今天晚上把阿尔贝·马尔塞夫子爵绑票绑到了这里。”伯爵用一种使弗兰兹发抖的语气继续说道。“这位年轻的先生是我的一个‘朋友’。这位年轻的先生和我同住在一家旅馆里，他曾坐我的私人马车在高碌街来来去去的兜了八天圈子。可是，我再向你说一遍，你把他绑票绑到这儿来了，并且，”伯爵从他的口袋里拿出了那封信，又说道，“你还向他勒索一笔赎金，好象他是一个无关紧要的人似的。” \\n\\n “你们为什么不把这些事告诉我？”匪首转身问他的部下，那些人都被他的目光逼得往后退。“你们为什么让我对象伯爵这样一位我们的性命都捏在他手里的先生食言？我以基督的血发誓！我要是知道了你们中的哪一个知道那位年轻的先生是大人的朋友，我会亲手把他的脑髓打出来的！” \\n\\n “是吧，”伯爵转身对弗兰兹说道，“我告诉您这件事是个误会吧。” \\n\\n “您不是一个人来的？”万帕不安地问道。 \\n\\n “我是和接到这封信的人一起来的，我想向他证明，罗吉·万帕是一个信守的人。来吧，大人这是罗吉·万帕，他会因这次误会亲自向您表示他深切的歉意的。” \\n\\n 弗兰兹走过去，首领也走上前几步来迎接他。“欢迎光临，大人！”他说道，“您已经听到伯爵刚才说的话了，也听到了我的答复。让我再说一句，我是不愿意为了我对您朋友所定的那笔四千毕阿士特的赎金而发生这样一件事的。” \\n\\n “可是，”弗兰兹不安地环顾着四周说道，“子爵在哪儿呢？我没看见他呀。” \\n\\n “我希望他没出什么事吧？”伯爵皱着眉头说道。 \\n\\n “肉票在那边，”万帕指着前面有强盗把守着的那个凹进去的地方回答说，“我当亲自去告诉他，他已经自由了。”首领向他所指的那个作为阿尔贝的牢房的地方走去，弗兰兹和伯爵跟在他的后面。 \\n\\n “肉票在干什么？”万帕问那个哨兵。 \\n\\n “说实话！队长，”哨兵答道，“我不知道，我有一个钟头没听到他的动静了。” \\n\\n “请进来吧，大人。”万帕说道。 \\n\\n “伯爵和弗兰兹跟着那个强盗头儿走上了七八级台阶，后者拔开门闩，打开了门。于是，在一盏和照亮前面那个墓穴同样的油灯的微光之下，他们看见阿尔贝裹着一件一个强盗借给他的披风，正躺在一个角落里呼呼地大睡呢。“嗨！”伯爵带着他那种奇特的微笑说道，“一个明天早晨七点钟就要被枪毙的人，现在大睡一觉倒实在是不错呀！” \\n\\n 万帕带着一种很钦佩的神色望着阿尔贝，对于这样勇敢的表现，他显然也是很感动的。 \\n\\n “您说得不错，伯爵阁下，”他说，“这位一定是您的朋友。” \\n\\n 于是他走到阿尔贝面前，摇一摇他的肩头，说，请大人醒一醒。” \\n\\n 阿尔贝伸了个懒腰，擦了擦眼皮，然后睁开眼睛。“啊，啊！”他说，“是你吗，队长？你应该让我睡觉的呀。我做了一个很有趣的梦：梦中我正在托洛尼亚府里和Ｇ伯爵夫人跳极乐舞呢。”说完他从口袋里掏出表来看了一下，这只表他一直保存着，为的是可以知道时间究竟飞驰得有多快。 \\n\\n “才一点半！”他说，“你见了什么鬼，竟在这个时候来叫醒我？” \\n\\n “我是来告诉您已经自由了，大人。” \\n\\n “亲爱的，”阿尔贝十分镇定地答道，“还记得拿破仑的那句格言吗？‘除非报告坏消息，否则切勿吵醒我’，要是你能让我多睡一会儿，我就可以把我的极乐舞跳完了，那我就要对你终生感激不尽啦。哦，这么说，他们把我的赎金付清了是吗？” \\n\\n “没有，大人。” \\n\\n “咦，那么我怎么会自由了呢？” \\n\\n “有一个我万事都不能拒绝的人来向我要您来了。” \\n\\n “来这儿吗？” \\n\\n “是的，来这儿。” \\n\\n “真的！那个人可真算是一个最最慈悲的人了。”阿尔贝四面环顾了一下，看到了弗兰兹。“什么！”他说道，“是你吗，亲爱的弗兰兹，谁还曾对朋友表示过这样真挚的友谊呢？” \\n\\n “不，不是我，”弗兰兹答道，“是我们的邻居，基督山伯爵。” \\n\\n “啊，啊！伯爵阁下，”阿尔贝高兴地说道，并整理了一下他的领结和衣袖，“您真的太好啦，我希望您能知道我是永远感激您的。第一，为了马车，第二，为这件事。”于是他把他的手伸给了伯爵，伯爵在把他的手伸出来的时候，全身打了一个寒颤，但他终于还是把手伸了出来。那个强盗呆愣愣地望着这个场面，感到非常惊奇。显然他是看惯了他的俘虏在他的面前发抖的，可是这个人却一刻都不曾改变他那愉快幽默的态度。至于弗兰兹，他看到阿尔贝在强盗面前能维护民族的尊严，心里非常高兴。“我亲爱的阿尔贝，”他说道，“假如你肯赶紧走，我们还来得及到托洛尼亚府上去过夜。你可以结束你那一曲被打断的极乐舞，那样，你心里就不会再怨恨罗吉先生了，他在这件\\n\\n
