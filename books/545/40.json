{"id":43908,"no":40,"title":"Chapter 44 The Vendetta","content":"\"AT WHAT POINT shall I begin my story, your excellency?\" asked Bertuccio. \"Where you please,\" returned Monte Cristo, \"since I know nothing at all of it.\" \"I thought the Abbé Busoni had told your excellency.\" \"Some particulars, doubtless, but that is seven or eight years ago, and I have forgotten them.\" \"Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excellency.\" \"Go on, M. Bertuccio; you will supply the want of the evening papers.\" \"The story begins in 1815.\" \"Ah,\" said Monte Cristo, \"1815 is not yesterday.\" \"No, monsieur, and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but then. I had a brother, an elder brother, who was in the service of the emperor; he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of Corsicans. This brother was my only friend; we became orphans--I at five, he at eighteen. He brought me up as if I had been his son, and in 1814 he married. When the emperor returned from the Island of Elba, my brother instantly joined the army, was slightly wounded at Waterloo, and retired with the army beyond the Loire.\" \"But that is the history of the Hundred Days, M. Bertuccio,\" said the count; \"unless I am mistaken, it has been already written.\" \"Excuse me, excellency, but these details are necessary, and you promised to be patient.\" \"Go on; I will keep my word.\" \"One day we received a letter. I should tell you that we lived in the little village of Rogliano, at the extremity of Cape Corso. This letter was from my brother. He told us that the army was disbanded, and that he should return by Chateauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy, and N?mes; and, if I had any money, he prayed me to leave it for him at N?mes, with an inn-keeper with whom I had dealings.\" \"In the smuggling line?\" said Monte Cristo. \"Eh, your excellency? Every one must live.\" \"Certainly; go on.\" \"I loved my brother tenderly, as I told your excellency, and I resolved not to send the money, but to take it to him myself. I possessed a thousand francs. I left five hundred with Assunta, my sister-in-law, and with the other five hundred I set off for N?mes. It was easy to do so, and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea, everything favored my project. But, after we had taken in our cargo, the wind became contrary, so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the Rhone. At last, however, we succeeded, and worked up to Arles. I left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, and took the road to N?mes.\" \"We are getting to the story now?\" \"Yes, your excellency; excuse me, but, as you will see, I only tell you what is absolutely necessary. Just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of France. Three brigands, called Trestaillon, Truphemy, and Graffan, publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of Bonapartism. You have doubtless heard of these massacres, your excellency?\" \"Vaguely; I was far from France at that period. Go on.\" \"As I entered N?mes, I literally waded in blood; at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers, who killed, plundered, and burned. At the sight of this slaughter and devastation I became terrified, not for myself--for I, a simple Corsican fisherman, had nothing to fear; on the contrary, that time was most favorable for us smugglers--but for my brother, a soldier of the empire, returning from the army of the Loire, with his uniform and his epaulets, there was everything to apprehend. I hastened to the inn-keeper. My misgivings had been but too true. My brother had arrived the previous evening at N?mes, and, at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality, he had been assassinated. I did all in my power to discover the murderers, but no one durst tell me their names, so much were they dreaded. I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so much, and which feared nothing, and I went to the king\u0027s attorney.\" \"And this king\u0027s attorney was named Villefort?\" asked Monte Cristo carelessly. \"Yes, your excellency; he came from Marseilles, where he had been deputy-procureur. His zeal had procured him advancement, and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the Island of Elba.\" \"Then,\" said Monte Cristo \"you went to him?\" \"\u0027Monsieur,\u0027 I said, \u0027my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of N?mes, I know not by whom, but it is your duty to find out. You are the representative of justice here, and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect.\u0027--\u0027Who was your brother?\u0027 asked he.--\u0027A lieutenant in the Corsican battalion.\u0027--\u0027A soldier of the usurper, then?\u0027--\u0027A soldier of the French army.\u0027--\u0027Well,\u0027 replied he, \u0027he has smitten with the sword, and he has perished by the sword.\u0027--\u0027You are mistaken, monsieur,\u0027 I replied; \u0027he has perished by the poniard.\u0027--\u0027What do you want me to do?\u0027 asked the magistrate.--\u0027I have already told you--avenge him.\u0027--\u0027On whom?\u0027--\u0027On his murderers.\u0027--\u0027How should I know who they are?\u0027--\u0027Order them to be sought for.\u0027--\u0027Why, your brother has been involved in a quarrel, and killed in a duel. All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor, but which are not suffered now, for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct.\u0027--\u0027Monsieur,\u0027 I replied, \u0027it is not for myself that I entreat your interference--I should grieve for him or avenge him, but my poor brother had a wife, and were anything to happen to me, the poor creature would perish from want, for my brother\u0027s pay alone kept her. Pray, try and obtain a small government pension for her.\u0027 \"\u0027Every revolution has its catastrophes,\u0027 returned M. de Villefort; \u0027your brother has been the victim of this. It is a misfortune, and government owes nothing to his family. If we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king, when, in their turn, they were in power, your brother would be to-day, in all probability, condemned to death. What has happened is quite natural, and in conformity with the law of reprisals.\u0027--\u0027What,\u0027 cried I, \u0027do you, a magistrate, speak thus to me?\u0027--\u0027All these Corsicans are mad, on my honor,\u0027 replied M. de Villefort; \u0027they fancy that their countryman is still emperor. You have mistaken the time, you should have told me this two months ago, it is too late now. Go now, at once, or I shall have you put out.\u0027 \"I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty. But he was a man of stone. I approached him, and said in a low voice, \u0027Well, since you know the Corsicans so well, you know that they always keep their word. You think that it was a good deed to kill my brother, who was a Bonapartist, because you are a royalist. Well, I, who am a Bonapartist also, declare one thing to you, which is, that I will kill you. From this moment I declare the vendetta against you, so protect yourself as well as you can, for the next time we meet your last hour has come.\u0027 And before he had recovered from his surprise, I opened the door and left the room.\" \"Well, well,\" said Monte Cristo, \"such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things, M. Bertuccio, and to a king\u0027s attorney at that! But did he know what was meant by the terrible word \u0027vendetta\u0027?\" \"He knew so well, that from that moment he shut himself in his house, and never went out unattended, seeking me high and low. Fortunately, I was so well concealed that he could not find me. Then he became alarmed, and dared not stay any longer at N?mes, so he solicited a change of residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was nominated to Versailles. But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it went, was never above half a day\u0027s journey before me, who followed him on foot. The most important thing was, not to kill him only--for I had an opportunity of doing so a hundred times--but to kill him without being discovered--at least, without being arrested. I no longer belonged to myself, for I had my sister-in-law to protect and provide for. For three months I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took not a step out-of-doors without my following him. At length I discovered that he went mysteriously to Auteuil. I followed him thither, and I saw him enter the house where we now are, only, instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street, he came on horseback, or in his carriage, left the one or the other at the little inn, and entered by the gate you see there.\" Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio alluded. \"As I had nothing more to do at Versailles, I went to Auteuil, and gained all the information I could. If I wished to surprise him, it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him. The house belonged, as the concièrge informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-Méran, Villefort\u0027s father-in-law. M. de Saint-Méran lived at Marseilles, so that this country house was useless to him, and it was reported to be let to a young widow, known only by the name of \u0027the baroness.\u0027 \"One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not overlooked by any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de Villefort. When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features, I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair. As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure, I saw she would ere long become a mother. A few moments after, the little door was opened and a man entered. The young woman hastened to meet him. They threw themselves into each other\u0027s arms, embraced tenderly, and returned together to the house. The man was M. de Villefort; I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone.\" \"And,\" asked the count, \"did you ever know the name of this woman?\" \"No, excellency,\" returned Bertuccio; \"you will see that I had no time to learn it.\" \"Go on.\" \"That evening,\" continued Bertuccio, \"I could have killed the procureur, but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood, I was fearful of not killing him on the spot, and that if his cries were overheard I might be taken; so I put it off until the next occasion, and in order that nothing should escape me, I took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden. Three days after, about seven o\u0027clock in the evening, I saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop, and take the road to Sèvres. I concluded that he was going to Versailles, and I was not deceived. Three hours later, the man returned covered with dust, his errand was performed, and two minutes after, another man on foot, muffled in a mantle, opened the little door of the garden, which he closed after him. I descended rapidly; although I had not seen Villefort\u0027s face, I recognized him by the beating of my heart. I crossed the street, and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall, and by means of which I had once before looked into the garden. This time I did not content myself with looking, but I took my knife out of my pocket, felt that the point was sharp, and sprang over the wall. My first care was to run to the door; he had left the key in it, taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock. Nothing, then, preventing my escape by this means, I examined the grounds. The garden was long and narrow; a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle, and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage, that made a background for the shrubs and flowers. In order to go from the door to the house, or from the house to the door, M. de Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees. \"It was the end of September; the wind blew violently. The faint glimpses of the pale moon, hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky, whitened the gravel walks that led to the house, but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies, in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery. I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must take, and scarcely was I there when, amidst the gusts of wind, I fancied I heard groans; but you know, or rather you do not know, your excellency, that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears. Two hours passed thus, during which I imagined I heard moans repeatedly. Midnight struck. As the last stroke died away, I saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended. The door opened, and the man in the mantle reappeared. The terrible moment had come, but I had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least. I drew my knife from my pocket again, opened it, and made ready to strike. The man in the mantle advanced towards me, but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in his hand. I was afraid, not of a struggle, but of a failure. When he was only a few paces from me, I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a spade. I was still unable to divine for what reason M. de Villefort had this spade in his hands, when he stopped close to the thicket where I was, glanced round, and began to dig a hole in the earth. I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle, which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely. Then, I confess, curiosity mingled with hatred; I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there, and I remained motionless, holding my breath. Then an idea crossed my mind, which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box, two feet long, and six or eight inches deep. I let him place the box in the hole he had made, then, while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation, I rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast, exclaiming,--\u0027I am Giovanni Bertuccio; thy death for my brother\u0027s; thy treasure for his widow; thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than I had hoped.\u0027 I know not if he heard these words; I think he did not, for he fell without a cry. I felt his blood gush over my face, but I was intoxicated, I was delirious, and the blood refreshed, instead of burning me. In a second I had disinterred the box; then, that it might not be known I had done so, I filled up the hole, threw the spade over the wall, and rushed through the door, which I double-locked, carrying off the key.\" \"Ah,\" said Monte Cristo \"it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery.\" \"No, your excellency,\" returned Bertuccio; \"it was a vendetta followed by restitution.\" \"And was the sum a large one?\" \"It was not money.\" \"Ah, I recollect,\" replied the count; \"did you not say something of an infant?\" \"Yes, excellency; I hastened to the river, sat down on the bank, and with my knife forced open the lock of the box. In a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new-born child. Its purple visage, and its violet-colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation, but as it was not yet cold, I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet. After a moment I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart, and as I had been assistant at the hospital at Bastia, I did what a doctor would have done--I inflated the lungs by blowing air into them, and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it began to breathe, and cried feebly. In my turn I uttered a cry, but a cry of joy. \u0027God has not cursed me then,\u0027 I cried, \u0027since he permits me to save the life of a human creature, in exchange for the life I have taken away.\u0027\" \"And what did you do with the child?\" asked Monte Cristo. \"It was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape.\" \"I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it, but I knew that at Paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures. As I passed the city gates I declared that I had found the child on the road, and I inquired where the asylum was; the box confirmed my statement, the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents, the blood with which I was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from any one else. No objection was raised, but they pointed out the asylum, which was situated at the upper end of the Rue d\u0027Enfer, and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces, so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child, while the other remained in my possession, I rang the bell, and fled with all speed. A fortnight after I was at Rogliano, and I said to Assunta,--\u0027Console thyself, sister; Israel is dead, but he is avenged.\u0027 She demanded what I meant, and when I had told her all,--\u0027Giovanni,\u0027 said she, \u0027you should have brought this child with you; we would have replaced the parents it has lost, have called it Benedetto, and then, in consequence of this good action, God would have blessed us.\u0027 In reply I gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich.\" \"What letters were marked on the linen?\" said Monte Cristo. \"An H and an N, surmounted by a baron\u0027s coronet.\" \"By heaven, M. Bertuccio, you make use of heraldic terms; where did you study heraldry?\" \"In your service, excellency, where everything is learned.\" \"Go on, I am curious to know two things.\" \"What are they, your excellency ?\" \"What became of this little boy? for I think you told me it was a boy, M. Bertuccio.\" \"No excellency, I do not recollect telling you that.\" \"I thought you did; I must have been mistaken.\" \"No, you were not, for it was in reality a little boy. But your excellency wished to know two things; what was the second?\" \"The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor, and the Abbé Busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at N?mes.\" \"The story will be very long, excellency.\" \"What matter? you know I take but little sleep, and I do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either.\" Bertuccio bowed, and resumed his story. \"Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me, partly to supply the wants of the poor widow, I eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler, which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution. The southern districts were ill-watched in particular, in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in Avignon, N?mes, or Uzés. We profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere. Since my brother\u0027s assassination in the streets of N?mes, I had never entered the town; the result was that the inn-keeper with whom we were connected, seeing that we would no longer come to him, was forced to come to us, and had established a branch to his inn, on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire, at the sign of the Pont du Gard. We had thus, at Aigues-Mortes, Martigues, or Bouc, a dozen places where we left our goods, and where, in case of necessity, we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom-house officers. Smuggling is a profitable trade, when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed; as for myself, brought up in the mountains, I had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom-house officers, as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry, and an inquiry always looks back into the past. And in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars, or barrels of brandy without a permit. So, preferring death to capture, I accomplished the most astonishing deeds, and which, more than once, showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision, and vigorous and determined execution. In reality, when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises, you are no longer the equal of other men, or, rather, other men are no longer your equals, and whosoever has taken this resolution, feels his strength and resources doubled.\" \"Philosophy, M. Bertuccio,\" interrupted the Count; \"you have done a little of everything in your life.\" \"Oh, excellency,\" \"No, no; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late; yet I have no other observation to make, for what you say is correct, which is more than can be said for all philosophy.\" \"My journeys became more and more extensive and more productive. Assunta took care of all, and our little fortune increased. One day as I was setting off on an expedition, \u0027Go,\u0027 said she; \u0027at your return I will give you a surprise.\u0027 I questioned her, but in vain; she would tell me nothing, and I departed. Our expedition lasted nearly six weeks; we had been to Lucca to take in oil, to Leghorn for English cottons, and we ran our cargo without opposition, and returned home full of joy. When I entered the house, the first thing I beheld in the middle of Assunta\u0027s chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture, and in it a baby seven or eight months old. I uttered a cry of joy; the only moments of sadness I had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I had abandoned this child. For the assassination itself I had never felt any remorse. Poor Assunta had guessed all. She had profited by my absence, and furnished with the half of the linen, and having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum, had set off for Paris, and had reclaimed it. No objection was raised, and the infant was given up to her. Ah, I confess, your excellency, when I saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle, I felt my eyes filled with tears. \u0027Ah, Assunta,\u0027 cried I, \u0027you are an excellent woman, and heaven will bless you.\u0027\" \"This,\" said Monte Cristo, \"is less correct than your philosophy,--it is only faith.\" \"Alas, your excellency is right,\" replied Bertuccio, \"and God made this infant the instrument of our punishment. Never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely, and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up. He was a most lovely child, with large blue eyes, of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion; only his hair, which was too light, gave his face a most singular expression, and added to the vivacity of his look, and the malice of his smile. Unfortunately, there is a proverb which says that \u0027red is either altogether good or altogether bad.\u0027 The proverb was but too correct as regarded Benedetto, and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition. It is true that the indulgence of his foster-mother encouraged him. This child, for whom my poor sister would go to the town, five or six leagues off, to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats, preferred to Palma grapes or Genoese preserves, the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor\u0027s orchard, or the dried apples in his loft, when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden. One day, when Benedetto was about five or six, our neighbor Vasilio, who, according to the custom of the country, never locked up his purse or his valuables--for, as your excellency knows, there are no thieves in Corsica--complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse; we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money, but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement. One day, Benedetto, who had been gone from the house since morning, to our great anxiety, did not return until late in the evening, dragging a monkey after him, which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree. For more than a month past, the mischievous child, who knew not what to wish for, had taken it into his head to have a monkey. A boatman, who had passed by Rogliano, and who had several of these animals, whose tricks had greatly diverted him, had, doubtless, suggested this idea to him. \u0027Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees,\u0027 said I; \u0027confess how you obtained this animal.\u0027 Benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said, and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity. I became angry; he began to laugh, I threatened to strike him, and he made two steps backwards. \u0027You cannot beat me,\u0027 said he; \u0027you have no right, for you are not my father.\u0027 \"We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret, which we had so carefully concealed from him; however, it was this answer, in which the child\u0027s whole character revealed itself, that almost terrified me, and my arm fell without touching him. The boy triumphed, and this victory rendered him so audacious, that all the money of Assunta, whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it, was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against, and follies she had not the courage to prevent. When I was at Rogliano everything went on properly, but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became master, and everything went ill. When he was only eleven, he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty, the worst characters in Bastia, or, indeed, in Corsica, and they had already, for some mischievous pranks, been several times threatened with a prosecution. I became alarmed, as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences. I was compelled, at this period, to leave Corsica on an important expedition; I reflected for a long time, and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune, I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me. I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler, with the severe discipline on board, would have a salutary effect on his character, which was now well-nigh, if not quite, corrupt. I spoke to Benedetto alone, and proposed to him to accompany me, endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve. He heard me patiently, and when I had finished, burst out laughing. \"\u0027Are you mad, uncle?\u0027 (he called me by this name when he was in good humor); \u0027do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your mode of existence--my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself, exposed to the bitter frost at night, and the scorching heat by day, compelled to conceal yourself, and when you are perceived, receive a volley of bullets, all to earn a paltry sum? Why, I have as much money as I want; mother Assunta always furnishes me when I ask for it! You see that I should be a fool to accept your offer.\u0027 The arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me. Benedetto rejoined his associates, and I saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool.\" \"Sweet child,\" murmured Monte Cristo. \"Oh, had he been my own son,\" replied Bertuccio, \"or even my nephew, I would have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was striking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me to punish him. I gave my sister, who constantly defended the unfortunate boy, good advice, and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount, I showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future. My mind was already made up. Benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for when the fit seized him, he learned more in a day than others in a week. My intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship, and without letting him know anything of my plan, to convey him some morning on board; by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct. I set off for France, after having fixed upon the plan. Our cargo was to be landed in the Gulf of Lyons, and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 1829. The most perfect tranquillity was restored, and the vigilance of the custom-house officers was redoubled, and their strictness was increased at this time, in consequence of the fair at Beaucaire. \"Our expedition made a favorable beginning. We anchored our vessel--which had a double hold, where our goods were concealed--amidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhone from Beaucaire to Arles. On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night, and to convey it into the town, by the help of the inn-keeper with whom we were connected. Whether success rendered us imprudent, or whether we were betrayed, I know not; but one evening, about five o\u0027clock, our little cabin-boy came breathlessly, to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom-house officers advancing in our direction. It was not their proximity that alarmed us, for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the Rhone, but the care, according to the boy\u0027s account, that they took to avoid being seen. In an instant we were on the alert, but it was too late; our vessel was surrounded, and amongst the custom-house officers I observed several gendarmes, and, as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was brave at the sight of any other, I sprang into the hold, opened a port, and dropped into the river, dived, and only rose at intervals to breathe, until I reached a ditch that had recently been made from the Rhone to the canal that runs from Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes. I was now safe, for I could swim along the ditch without being seen, and I reached the canal in safety. I had designedly taken this direction. I have already told your excellency of an inn-keeper from N?mes who had set up a little tavern on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire.\" \"Yes,\" said Monte Cristo \"I perfectly recollect him; I think he was your colleague.\" \"Precisely,\" answered Bertuccio; \"but he had, seven or eight years before this period, sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles, who, having almost ruined himself in his old trade, wished to make his fortune in another. Of course, we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old; and it was of this man that I intended to ask shelter.\" \"What was his name?\" inquired the count, who seemed to become somewhat interested in Bertuccio\u0027s story. \"Gaspard Caderousse; he had married a woman from the village of Carconte, and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village. She was suffering from malarial fever, and seemed dying by inches. As for her husband, he was a strapping fellow of forty, or five and forty, who had more than once, in time of danger, given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage.\" \"And you say,\" interrupted Monte Cristo \"that this took place towards the year\"-- \"1829, your excellency.\" \"In what month?\" \"June.\" \"The beginning or the end?\" \"The evening of the 3d.\" \"Ah,\" said Monte Cristo \"the evening of the 3d of June, 1829. Go on.\" \"It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter, and, as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road, I resolved not to break through the rule, so climbing over the garden-hedge, I crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees, and fearing that Caderousse might have some guest, I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed the night, and which was only separated from the inn by a partition, in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence. My intention was, if Caderousse was alone, to acquaint him with my presence, finish the meal the custom-house officers had interrupted, and profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rhone, and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew. I stepped into the shed, and it was fortunate I did so, for at that moment Caderousse entered with a stranger. \"I waited patiently, not to overhear what they said, but because I could do nothing else; besides, the same thing had occurred often before. The man who was with Caderousse was evidently a stranger to the South of France; he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the Beaucaire fair, and who during the month the fair lasts, and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of Europe, often have dealings to the amount of 100,000 to 150,000 francs. Caderousse entered hastily. Then, seeing that the room was, as usual, empty, and only guarded by the dog, he called to his wife, \u0027Hello, Carconte,\u0027 said he, \u0027the worthy priest has not deceived us; the diamond is real.\u0027 An exclamation of joy was heard, and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step. \u0027What do you say?\u0027 asked his wife, pale as death. \"\u0027I say that the diamond is real, and that this gentleman, one of the first jewellers of Paris, will give us 50,000 francs for it. Only, in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us, he wishes you to relate to him, as I have done already, the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession. In the meantime please to sit down, monsieur, and I will fetch you some refreshment.\u0027 The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince. \u0027Relate your story, madame,\u0027 said he, wishing, no doubt, to profit by the absence of the husband, so that the latter could not influence the wife\u0027s story, to see if the two recitals tallied. \"\u0027Oh,\u0027 returned she, \u0027it was a gift of heaven. My husband was a great friend, in 1814 or 1815, of a sailor named Edmond Dantès. This poor fellow, whom Caderousse had forgotten, had not forgotten him, and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him.\u0027--\u0027But how did he obtain it?\u0027 asked the jeweller; \u0027had he it before he was imprisoned?\u0027--\u0027No, monsieur; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich Englishman, and as in prison he fell sick, and Dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother, the Englishman, when he was set free, gave this stone to Dantès, who, less fortunate, died, and, in his turn, left it to us, and charged the excellent abbé, who was here this morning, to deliver it.\u0027--\u0027The same story,\u0027 muttered the jeweller; \u0027and improbable as it seemed at first, it may be true. There\u0027s only the price we are not agreed about.\u0027--\u0027How not agreed about?\u0027 said Caderousse. \u0027I thought we agreed for the price I asked.\u0027--\u0027That is,\u0027 replied the jeweller, \u0027I offered 40,000 francs.\u0027--\u0027Forty thousand,\u0027 cried La Carconte; \u0027we will not part with it for that sum. The abbé told us it was worth 50,000 without the setting.\u0027 \"\u0027What was the abbé\u0027s name?\u0027 asked the indefatigable questioner.--\u0027The Abbé Busoni,\u0027 said La Carconte.--\u0027He was a foreigner?\u0027--\u0027An Italian, from the neighborhood of Mantua, I believe.\u0027--\u0027Let me see this diamond again,\u0027 replied the jeweller; \u0027the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone.\u0027 Caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen, opened, and gave it to the jeweller. At the sight of the diamond, which was as large as a hazel-nut, La Carconte\u0027s eyes sparkled with cupidity.\" \"And what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?\" said Monte Cristo; \"did you credit it?\" \"Yes, your excellency. I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man, and I thought him incapable of committing a crime, or even a theft.\" \"That did more honor to your heart than to your experience, M. Bertuccio. Had you known this Edmond Dantès, of whom they spoke?\" \"No, your excellency, I had never heard of him before, and never but once afterwards, and that was from the Abbé Busoni himself, when I saw him in the prison at N?mes.\" \"Go on.\" \"The jeweller took the ring, and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales, he took the stone out of its setting, and weighed it carefully. \u0027I will give you 45,000,\u0027 said he, \u0027but not a sou more; besides, as that is the exact value of the stone, I brought just that sum with me.\u0027--\u0027Oh, that\u0027s no matter,\u0027 replied Caderousse, \u0027I will go back with you to fetch the other 5,000 francs.\u0027--\u0027No,\u0027 returned the jeweller, giving back the diamond and the ring to Caderousse--\u0027no, it is worth no more, and I am sorry I offered so much, for the stone has a flaw in it, which I had not seen. However, I will not go back on my word, and I will give 45,000.\u0027--\u0027At least, replace the diamond in the ring,\u0027 said La Carconte sharply.--\u0027Ah, true,\u0027 replied the jeweller, and he reset the stone.--\u0027No matter,\u0027 observed Caderousse, replacing the box in his pocket, \u0027some one else will purchase it.\u0027--\u0027Yes,\u0027 continued the jeweller; \u0027but some one else will not be so easy as I am, or content himself with the same story. It is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond. He will inform against you. You will have to find the Abbé Busoni; and abbes who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare. The law would seize it, and put you in prison; if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty, the ring will be lost, or a false stone, worth three francs, will be given you, instead of a diamond worth 50,000 or perhaps 55,000 francs; from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing.\u0027 Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other.--\u0027No,\u0027 said Caderousse, \u0027we are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs.\u0027--\u0027As you please, my dear sir,\u0027 said the, jeweller; \u0027I had, however, as you see, brought you the money in bright coin.\u0027 And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold, and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper, and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes. \"There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse; it was plain that the small shagreen case, which he turned over and over in his hand, did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze. He turned towards his wife. \u0027What do you think of this?\u0027 he asked in a low voice.--\u0027Let him have it--let him have it,\u0027 she said. \u0027If he returns to Beaucaire without the diamond, he will inform against us, and, as he says, who knows if we shall ever again see the Abbé Busoni?--in all probability we shall never see him.\u0027--\u0027Well, then, so I will!\u0027 said Caderousse; \u0027so you may have the diamond for 45,000 francs. But my wife wants a gold chain, and I want a pair of silver buckles.\u0027 The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box, which contained several samples of the articles demanded. \u0027Here,\u0027 he said, \u0027I am very straightforward in my dealings--take your choice.\u0027 The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis, and the husband a pair of buckles. worth perhaps fifteen francs.--\u0027I hope you will not complain now?\u0027 said the jeweller. \"\u0027The abbé told me it was worth 50,000 francs,\u0027 muttered Caderousse. \u0027Come, come--give it to me! What a strange fellow you are,\u0027 said the jeweller, taking the diamond from his hand. \u0027I give you 45,000 francs--that is, 2,500 livres of income,--a fortune such as I wish I had myself, and you are not satisfied!\u0027--\u0027And the five and forty thousand francs,\u0027 inquired Caderousse in a hoarse voice, \u0027where are they? Come--let us see them.\u0027--\u0027Here they are,\u0027 replied the jeweller, and he counted out upon the table 15,000 francs in gold, and 30,000 francs in bank-notes. \"\u0027Wait while I light the lamp,\u0027 said La Carconte; \u0027it is growing dark, and there may be some mistake.\u0027 In fact, night had come on during this conversation, and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half-hour. The thunder growled in the distance; but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller, Caderousse, or La Carconte, absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain. I myself felt; a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these bank-notes; it seemed to me that I was in a dream, and, as it always happens in a dream, I felt myself riveted to the spot. Caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes, then handed them to his wife, who counted and counted them again in her turn. During this time, the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight, and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those which--precursors of the storm--began to play in at the windows. \u0027Well,\u0027 inquired the jeweller, \u0027is the cash all right?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 said Caderousse. \u0027Give me the pocket-book, La Carconte, and find a bag somewhere.\u0027 \"La Carconte went to a cupboard, and returned with an old leathern pocket-book and a bag. From the former she took some greasy letters, and put in their place the bank-notes, and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each, which, in all probability, formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple. \u0027There,\u0027 said Caderousse; \u0027and now, although you have wronged us of perhaps 10,000 francs, will you have your supper with us? I invite you with good-will.\u0027--\u0027Thank you,\u0027 replied the jeweller, \u0027it must be getting late, and I must return to Beaucaire--my wife will be getting uneasy.\u0027 He drew out his watch, and exclaimed, \u0027Morbleu! nearly nine o\u0027clock--why, I shall not get back to Beaucaire before midnight! Good-night, my friends. If the Abbé Busoni should by any accident return, think of me.\u0027--\u0027In another week you will have left Beaucaire.\u0027 remarked Caderousse, \u0027for the fair ends in a few days.\u0027--\u0027True, but that makes no difference. Write to me at Paris, to M. Joannes, in the Palais Royal, arcade Pierre, No. 45. I will make the journey on purpose to see him, if it is worth while.\u0027 At this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder, accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid, that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp. \"\u0027See here,\u0027 exclaimed Caderousse. \u0027You cannot think of going out in such weather as this.\u0027--\u0027Oh, I am not afraid of thunder,\u0027 said the jeweller.--\u0027And then there are robbers,\u0027 said La Carconte. \u0027The road is never very safe during fair time.\u0027--\u0027Oh, as to the robbers,\u0027 said Joannes, \u0027here is something for them,\u0027 and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols, loaded to the muzzle. \u0027Here,\u0027 said he, \u0027are dogs who bark and bite at the same time, they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond, Friend Caderousse.\u0027 \"Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look. It seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought. \u0027Well, then, a good journey to you,\u0027 said Caderousse.--\u0027Thanks,\u0027 replied the jeweller. He then took his cane, which he had placed against an old cupboard, and went out. At the moment when he opened the door, such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished. \u0027Oh,\u0027 said he, \u0027this is very nice weather, and two leagues to go in such a storm.\u0027--\u0027Remain,\u0027 said Caderousse. \u0027You can sleep here.\u0027--\u0027Yes; do stay,\u0027 added La Carconte in a tremulous voice; \u0027we will take every care of you.\u0027--\u0027No; I must sleep at Beaucaire. So, once more, good-night.\u0027 Caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold. \u0027I can see neither heaven nor earth,\u0027 said the jeweller, who was outside the door. \u0027Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?\u0027--\u0027To the right,\u0027 said Caderousse. \u0027You cannot go wrong--the road is bordered by trees on both sides.\u0027--\u0027Good--all right,\u0027 said a voice almost lost in the distance. \u0027Close the door,\u0027 said La Carconte; \u0027I do not like open doors when it thunders.\u0027--\u0027Particularly when there is money in the house, eh?\u0027 answered Caderousse, double-locking the door. \"He came into the room, went to the cupboard, took out the bag and pocket-book, and both began, for the third time, to count their gold and bank-notes. I never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances. The woman, especially, was hideous; her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified, her countenance had become livid, and her eyes resembled burning coals. \u0027Why,\u0027 she inquired in a hoarse voice, \u0027did you invite him to sleep here to-night?\u0027--\u0027Why?\u0027 said Caderousse with a shudder; \u0027why, that he might not have the trouble of returning to Beaucaire.\u0027--\u0027Ah,\u0027 responded the woman, with an expression impossible to describe; \u0027I thought it was for something else.\u0027--\u0027Woman, woman--why do you have such ideas?\u0027 cried Caderousse; \u0027or, if you have them, why don\u0027t you keep them to yourself?\u0027--\u0027Well,\u0027 said La Carconte, after a moment\u0027s pause, \u0027you are not a man.\u0027--\u0027What do you mean?\u0027 added Caderousse.--\u0027If you had been a man, you would not have let him go from here.\u0027--\u0027Woman!\u0027--\u0027Or else he should not have reached Beaucaire.\u0027--\u0027Woman!\u0027--\u0027The road takes a turn--he is obliged to follow it--while alongside of the canal there is a shorter road.\u0027--\u0027Woman!--you offend the good God. There--listen!\u0027 And at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder, while the livid lightning illumined the room, and the thunder, rolling away in the distance, seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode. \u0027Mercy!\u0027 said Caderousse, crossing himself. “我的故事从什么地方讲起呢，伯爵阁下？”贝尔图乔问道。 “随便你好了，”基督山回答，“反正我什么都不知道。” “我想布沙尼神甫可能已告诉过大人了吧。” “是的，说过一点，但那是七八年以前的事了，我都忘记啦。” “那么我可以随意地讲，不必担心大人听了会厌倦” “说吧，贝尔图乔先生，你可以补充晚报的不足。” “事情要从一八一五年开始讲起。” “啊，”基督山说，“一八一五年可不是昨天。” “不，大人，可是这一切我都记得清清楚楚，就象是昨天刚发生的一样。我曾有一个哥哥，他在皇帝［指拿破仑——译注］手下服务，曾升到了中尉。他那一团全都是科西嘉人。这个哥哥是我唯一的朋友。我们都是孤儿，那时我五岁，他十八岁。他抚养我长大，把我当作他的儿子般看待，一八一四年，他结了婚。当皇帝从厄尔巴岛回来的时候，我的哥哥立刻就去参了军，在滑铁卢受了轻伤，随军退到了卢瓦尔。” “但这是‘百日’政变的历史，贝尔图乔先生，”伯爵说道，“要是我没记错的话，这些事都已记载在史书上了。” “请原谅我，大人，但这些细节都必须讲一下的，而您答应过我肯耐心听的呀。” “说下去吧，我一定信守诺言。” “有一天，我们收到了一封信。我应该先告诉你，我们住的地方是一个名叫洛格里亚诺的小村子，就在科西嘉海峡的头上。他告诉我们说，军队已经解散了，他要取道经夏托鲁，克莱蒙费朗，蒲伊和尼姆回来，假如我有钱，他叫我托人带到尼姆去留给他，交给一个和我有交往的客栈老板。” “是走私线上的人吗？”基督山问道。 “伯爵阁下，人总得活下去呀。” “当然啦，继续讲吧。” “我深爱我的哥哥，这我已告诉过大人了，我决定不托人带钱去，而是亲自带去给他。我有一千法郎，我留下了五百给我的嫂嫂爱苏泰，就带着其余那五百动身到尼姆去了。这是很容易办到的，因为我自己有一条船，而恰巧有一船货要运出去，一切都对我的计划很有利。但当我们把货装好以后，风向却逆转了，以致于我们四五天都进不了罗纳河。最后，我们终于成功了，就逆流向阿尔驶去。我在比里加答和布揆耳之间下船，取陆路向尼姆走去。” “我们现在快要讲到故事的本身了是吧？” “是的，大人，请原谅我，但是，您一会儿就会知道的，我所讲的话，都是省得不能再省的了。正在这个时候，那次著名的法国南部大屠杀发生了。有两三支流寇，叫什么德太龙，杜希蛮和格拉番的，公开地暗杀人，凡是被他们认为有拿破仑党嫌疑的，都有被杀的危险。您一定也听说过这次大屠杀吧，伯爵阁下？” “隐约听说过，那时候我正在离法国很远的地方。往下说吧。” “我一进尼姆，真可谓一脚踏进了血泊里，因为每走一步我都会遇到几个死尸，而那些杀人的强盗还在到处杀人，掳掠，纵火。一看到这种到处杀戮和破坏的景象，我吓慌了——不是为我自己（我不过是个老老实实的科西嘉渔夫，没有什么可害怕的，正巧相反，那正是我们走私贩子最有利的时机），而是为了我的哥哥，他是帝国时代的军人，刚从卢瓦尔军队里回来，凭他的制服和他的肩章，就够让人处处担心的了。我赶紧去找客栈老板。我的推测实在太准啦：我的哥哥是前一天傍晚到尼姆的，刚走到他想借宿的那间房子门口，就被人刺死了，我费尽心机地去寻找凶手，但谁都不敢把他们的名字告诉我，他们实在是吓坏啦。于是我想起了常常听人说起的法国司法机关，据说它是什么都不怕的，我就去要求见检察官。” “这位检察官的名字叫维尔福？”基督山随随便便地问道。 “是的，大人，他是从马赛来的，曾做过马赛的代理检察官。他因为对王室忠心，所以升了一级，据说他就是最先把拿破仑从厄尔巴岛出走这个消息通知政府的人之一。” “那么，”基督山说道，“你们去见他了？” “‘先生，’我对他说，‘我的哥哥昨天在尼姆街上被人暗杀了，我不知道是谁杀死他的，但查究这件事是您的责任。您是这儿的法院院长，法院应该为它以前不能保护的人复仇。’‘你的哥哥是什么人？’他问道。‘科西嘉步兵大队的一个中尉。’‘那么说，是逆贼手下的一个军人罗？’‘是法国陆军里的一个军人。’‘哦，’他回答说，‘他用剑杀人，就在剑下亡身。’‘您错啦，先生，’我答道，‘他是被匕首刺死的。’‘你要我怎么办？’那个法官问道。‘我已经告诉过您啦，为他报仇。’‘去拿谁来报仇？’‘拿他的凶手呀。’‘我怎么知道谁是凶手呢？’‘吩咐他们去找呀。’‘为什么？你的哥哥和人吵架，是在一场决斗中被杀死的。所有这些老军人都无法无天的，皇帝时代，大家还能容忍他们，但现在可不同啦，因为我们南方人是不喜欢军人或混乱状态的。’“‘先生，’我回答说，‘我来请您干预这件事，不是为我自己，至于我，我痛哭一场，或为他报仇就行了，但我那可怜的哥哥有一个老婆，要是我万一发生了什么事，那个可怜的人就会饿死的，因为她一向靠我哥哥的薪水生活的。请为她在政府里弄一笔小小的抚恤金吧。’‘每一次革命总是有灾难的，’维尔福先生回答说。‘你的哥哥是这次灾难里的牺牲品。这是天灾，政府对他的家庭是毫无义务的。假如我们从各种复仇法上来判断，逆贼的追随者以前曾处处迫害王党，现在轮到他们当权，你的哥哥在今天多半会被判处死刑的。这种事情是很自然的，这是报应的定律嘛。’‘什么！’我大声叫道，‘你做法官的也对我这样说？’‘这些科西嘉人简直都疯了，我敢断定，’维尔福先生回答说，‘他们以为他们的老乡还依旧在做皇帝呢。你看错了时代啦，你应该在两个月之前来告诉我的，现在太晚了。赶快走吧，不然我就要用强迫手段了。’我望了他一会儿，想看看要是再向他请求会不会有什么收获，但这个人是石头做的。我走近他，低声说道，‘好吧，既然你把科西嘉人看得这样清楚，你就一定该知道，他们是绝不食言的。你以为杀死我哥哥是件好事，因为他是个拿破仑党，而你是一个保皇党！好吧，我，我也是一个拿破仑党，我现在向你宣布一件事，就是我要杀死你！从我向你宣布为亲人复仇的这个时候起，你就赶紧想法保护你自己吧，因为下一次我再碰见你的时候，你死期就到了！’就在他惊魂未定的时候，我打开门逃了出去。” “啊，啊！”基督山说道，“看你的外表很老实，贝尔图乔先生，想不到你竟会对一位检察官做出这样的事来！他知不知道‘为亲人复仇’这几个可怕的字是什么意思？” “他知道得非常清楚，所以从那个时候起，他不带卫队就决不敢外出，总把自己关在家里，并派人到处抓我。幸亏，我躲藏得非常好，他找不到我，于是他心慌了，不敢再住在尼姆了。他要求调职，而他确实也极其神通广大，他调到了凡尔赛。但是，您是知道的，一个科西嘉人既已发誓要为自己的亲人报仇，是不管路途远近的。所以，他的马车尽管走得快，却从来不曾超过我半天的路程，我步行跟踪着他。最要紧的事情是不但要杀死他，因为这种机会我有过不下一百次了，并且要杀死他而又不被人发觉，至少不被人捉住。我已不再是属于我自己了，因为我得保护自己和想法养活我的嫂嫂。接连三个月，我盯住了维尔福先生，那三个月里，只要他一出门，我就跟着他。终于，我发觉他偷偷摸摸地到欧特伊去了。我就跟着他到了那儿，我看他走进了我们现在的这所房子，只是，他并不从朝街的大门进来，他原是骑马或是乘车来的，但他却把车子或马留在小客栈里，从那扇门进来，您看，就是那边儿的那扇门！” 基督山点了一下头，表示他能在黑暗中看到贝尔图乔所指的那扇门。 “我在凡尔赛既然无事可做，就到欧特伊来竭力探听消息。假如我想偷袭他，最合适的地点显然就是躲在这儿等候他了。这年房子，正如门房告诉大人的，是属于维尔福的岳父圣·梅朗先生的。圣·梅郎先生住在马赛，所以他用不着这所乡村别墅。据说房子已租给了一个青年寡妇，大家只知道她叫‘男爵夫人’。 “有一天傍晚，我正从墙外向里探望的时候，看见一个年轻而美丽的女人独自在花园里散步，花园里的情形不论从哪一个窗口都是望得到的，我猜测她是在等维尔福先生。当她走近时，能够辩别出她的面貌了，我便看出她才十八九岁，身材高挑，非常漂亮。而由于她穿着一件很松的绸衣，又没有什么东西挡住她的身体，所以我看出她不久就要做母亲了。过了一会儿，小门开了，进来了一个男人，那个青年女人就急忙向他迎上去。他们互相拥抱，亲密地接吻，一同回到了屋子里。这个男人就是维尔福。我当时想，当他回去的时候，尤其是假如他在晚上回去的话，他就会独自在花园里走一大段路的。” “你知不知道这个女人的名字？”伯爵问道。 “不知道，大人，”贝尔图乔回答说，“你一会儿就会知道我当时没有时间去打听这件事。” “说下去”。 “那天晚上，”贝尔图乔继续说道，“我本来可以杀死那个检察官的，但我对于地形还不够熟悉。我深恐不能立刻杀死他，要是他一喊，我可就逃不掉了。我把这件事拖到了他下次再来的时候。而为了不使这些逃过我的眼睛，我弄了一个窗子对着街道的房间，以便随时窥视花园里的情形。三天以后，约莫晚上七点钟的时候，我看见一个仆人骑着马疾驰着离开了房子，踏上了通往塞夫勒去的大道。我推测他是到凡尔赛去的，我没猜错。三个钟头之后，那个人满身灰尘地人回来了，他的使命已经完成了。十分钟之后，又来了一个男人，是徒步来的，裹着一件披风，他打开了花园的小门，一进去就把门关上了，我赶紧下来，虽然我还没看清维尔福的脸，但从我剧烈的心跳上就可以认出是他。我穿过街道，奔到了墙角上的一个邮筒前面。我以前就是用了这个邮筒的帮助朝花园里窥探的，这一次，只是望望已不能使我满足了，我从口袋里拿出小刀来，自己先试了一下，刀尖的确很锋利，然后就从墙上翻了过来。我做的第一件事就是跑去看看那扇门，原来他把钥匙留在了门上，但为小心起见，他把钥匙在锁孔里连转了两次。那么，没问题我可以从这扇门逃出去的。我把地形仔细地观察了一遍。花园是个长方形的，中间有一片光滑的草坪，四角有枝叶茂密的树丛，树丛中夹杂着矮树和花草。要从那扇门走到屋子里或从屋子里走到那扇门，维尔福先生必须经过一处树丛。 “当时九月底，风很猛烈。大块的乌云扫过了天空，不时地把那苍白的月亮遮住了，这时，微弱的月光染白了那条通到屋子里去的石子路，但却无法穿透那黑压压的树丛，人要是躲在这茂密的树丛里，是决不会被发现的。我就躲在离维尔福必经之路最近的一个树丛里。我刚一躲进去，就好象听到在呼呼的风声里有呻吟声，您知道，或说得更确切些，您不知道，伯爵阁下，一个快要犯暗杀罪的人，总好象听到空中有低低的哭泣声。就这样过了两个钟头，在这期间，我好象觉得又有几次听到了这种呻吟的声音。后来午夜的钟声响了。当最后那一下钟声消逝的时候，我看到我刚才下来的那座秘密楼梯的窗口上透出了一点微弱的灯光。不久门开了，那个穿披风的人又出现了。那可怕的时机终于到啦，为这个时机我已准备了很久，所以我毫不心慌。我把小刀从口袋里摸出来，准备出击。那个穿披风的人向我走过来，但当他走近一些的时候，我看到他手里拿着一件武器。我是怕了，不是怕搏斗，而是怕失败。当他离我只有几步远的时候，我才看清那武器原来是一把铲子，这时他已在树丛边上停了下来，先向周围望了望，然后开始在地上掘起坑来。为了便于挖土，他把披风脱下来放在了草地上，我这才发觉在他的披风下面蒙着一样东西。当时，我承认，好奇心和我的仇恨混在了一起，我想看看维尔福究竟要在那儿干什么，所以我屏住呼吸，一动不动地站着，我的脑子里闪过了一个念头，而当我看到那检察官从他的披风底下抽出一个两呎长七八时深的木箱的时候，那个念头就更明确了。我等他把那只箱子放在坑里，然后，当他用脚把土踩结实，想消除一切痕迹的时候，我就冲了上去，把我的小刀一下插进了他的胸膛，一面大声说道：“我是琪奥凡尼·伯都西粤，拿你的命抵偿我哥哥的命，拿你的财宝给他的寡妇！你看见了吧，我这次报的仇比我所希望的还圆满！”我不知道他当时有没有听到这些话，我想他大概没有听到，因为他喊都没喊一声就倒了下去。我只觉得他的血喷了我一脸，我当时如醉如狂，而那血并没有使我更糊涂，却反而使我清醒过来。不一会儿，我便挖出了那只箱子，然后，为了不让人知道，我又填满了那个坑，把那把铲子抛到了墙外，冲到门口，把门牢牢地锁上，带走了那把钥匙。” “啊！”基督山说，“依我看，这是一桩小小的暗杀抢劫案。” “不，大人，”贝尔图乔答道，“这是为亲人复仇，外加赔偿损失。” “是笔不小的数目吧？” “那不是钱。” “啊！我记起来了，”伯爵回答说，“你不是说到过一个什么婴儿吧？” “是的，大人，我当时急忙奔到河边，在河堤上坐下来，用我的小刀撬开了箱子上的锁。在一块质地很好的纱布里，包着一个初生的婴儿。他的脸发紫，小手发青，显然是被人闷死的，但他的身体还没有冷，所以我有点犹豫不决，不敢把他扔到我脚边的河里。过了会儿，我好象觉得他的心脏微微地跳了一下，因为我曾在巴斯蒂亚的一家医院里当过助手，所以我就照医生的办法做起来——我把气吹到了他的肺里，使他的肺部膨胀起来。一刻钟之后，我看到他呼吸了，并且听到了一声微弱的喊叫。”于是我也喊了一声，但那是一声高兴的喊叫。“那么，上帝没有责骂我，”我喊道，“因为他允许我救活一条人命来抵偿我夺掉的那条命。” “你把那孩子怎么样了？”基督山问道。“对于一个想逃走的人，他无疑是个负担。” “我一点没想收留他，但我知道巴黎有一家医院是接受这种可怜虫的。当我经过关卡的时候，我便说这个孩子是我在路上捡到的，并问那家医院在什么地方。那只箱子证实了我的话，那块纱布也证明他的父母是有钱的人，我身上的血可以解释是从别人身上弄来的，也可以解释是从那孩子身上弄来的。他们没有刁难我，就把那家医院指给了我，原来医院就在恩弗街的头上。我先把那块布撕成两片，布上原先写着两个字，这样一来，一个字仍留在包孩子的那片布上，一个字便留在了我的手里，我来到医院门口，拉了拉铃，便飞也似的赶快逃走了。两个星期之后，我便回到了洛格里亚诺，我对爱苏泰说，‘你可以安心了，嫂嫂，伊斯雷死了，但他的仇已经报了。’她问我这句话是什么意思，我就把经过的一切都讲给她听了，‘琪奥凡尼，’她说道，‘你应该把那个孩子带回来。我们可以取代他失去的父母，给他取名叫贝尼代托［意大利文，意思是“祝福。——译注］，上帝看到我们做了这件好事，会祝福我们。’我把我藏着的半片布给了她，回答说，等我们的境况宽裕一点的时候，再去把他要回来。” “那片布绣的是什么字？”基督山问道。 “Ｈ和Ｎ，上面有一个男爵的花环图纹。” “天哪，伯都西粤先生，你竟用起家谱学的术语来了！你是在哪儿研究家谱学的？” “就在您这儿，大人，在您手下当差是什么都学得到的。” “讲下去吧，我很想知道两件事。” “什么事，大人？” “这个小男孩后来怎么样了？因为我记得你告诉过我他是一个男孩子，贝尔图乔先生。” “没有，大人，我不记得曾告诉过您这一点。” “我以为你说过的，是我弄错了。” “不，您没有错，他的确是个男孩儿。但大人想知道两件事情，那第二件事是什么？” “第二件是你被人控告的那件罪案的经过，就是后来","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/72/3963.html","bookId":545,"book":{"id":545,"title":"The Count of
