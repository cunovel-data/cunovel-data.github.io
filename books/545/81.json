{"id":43949,"no":81,"title":"Chapter 86 The Trial","content":"AT EIGHT o\u0027clock in the morning Albert had arrived at Beauchamp\u0027s door. The valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once. Beauchamp was in his bath. \"Here I am,\" said Albert. \"Well, my poor friend,\" replied Beauchamp, \"I expected you.\" \"I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance. Your having sent for me is another proof of your affection. So, without losing time, tell me, have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds?\" \"I think I have some clew.\" \"But first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot.\" Beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man, who was overwhelmed with shame and grief, the following facts. Two days previously, the article had appeared in another paper besides the Impartial, and, what was more serious, one that was well known as a government paper. Beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph. He sent immediately for a cabriolet, and hastened to the publisher\u0027s office. Although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper, Beauchamp--as it sometimes, we may say often, happens--was his intimate friend. The editor was reading, with apparent delight, a leading article in the same paper on beet-sugar, probably a composition of his own. \"Ah, pardieu,\" said Beauchamp, \"with the paper in your hand, my friend, I need not tell you the cause of my visit.\" \"Are you interested in the sugar question?\" asked the editor of the ministerial paper. \"No,\" replied Beauchamp, \"I have not considered the question; a totally different subject interests me.\" \"What is it?\" \"The article relative to Morcerf.\" \"Indeed? Is it not a curious affair?\" \"So curious, that I think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character.\" \"Not at all; we have received with the information all the requisite proofs, and we are quite sure M. de Morcerf will not raise his voice against us; besides, it is rendering a service to one\u0027s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them.\" Beauchamp was thunderstruck. \"Who, then, has so correctly informed you?\" asked he; \"for my paper, which gave the first information on the subject, has been obliged to stop for want of proof; and yet we are more interested than you in exposing M. de Morcerf, as he is a peer of France, and we are of the opposition.\" \"Oh, that is very simple; we have not sought to scandalize. This news was brought to us. A man arrived yesterday from Yanina, bringing a formidable array of documents; and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article, he told us it should be inserted in some other paper.\" Beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit, and left the office to despatch a courier to Morcerf. But he had been unable to send to Albert the following particulars, as the events had transpired after the messenger\u0027s departure; namely, that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the House of Peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly. Every one had arrived almost before the usual hour, and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues. Some were perusing the article, others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more. The Count of Morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues. Like all upstarts, he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position. The true nobility laughed at him, the talented repelled him, and the honorable instinctively despised him. He was, in fact, in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice; the finger of God once pointed at him, every one was prepared to raise the hue and cry. The Count of Morcerf alone was ignorant of the news. He did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article, and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse. He arrived at his usual hour, with a proud look and insolent demeanor; he alighted, passed through the corridors, and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door-keepers or the coolness of his colleagues. Business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered. Every one held the accusing paper, but, as usual, no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack. At length an honorable peer, Morcerf\u0027s acknowledged enemy, ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived. There was an impressive silence; Morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency. The count did not notice the introduction, in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the House; but at the mention of Yanina and Colonel Fernand, he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him. Moral wounds have this peculiarity,--they may be hidden, but they never close; always painful, always ready to bleed when touched, they remain fresh and open in the heart. The article having been read during the painful hush that followed, a universal shudder pervaded the assembly. and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks. He stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case; it was the honor of M. de Morcerf, and that of the whole House, he proposed to defend, by provoking a debate on personal questions, which are always such painful themes of discussion. He concluded by calling for an investigation, which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread, and restore M. de Morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion. Morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly. This timidity, which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt, conciliated some in his favor; for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred. The president put it to the vote, and it was decided that the investigation should take place. The count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence. Morcerf\u0027s courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow. \"My lords,\" answered he, \"it is not by time I could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me, and, doubtless, hidden in obscurity; it is immediately, and by a thunderbolt, that I must repel the flash of lightning which, for a moment, startled me. Oh, that I could, instead of taking up this defence, shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that I am their equal in worth.\" These words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused. \"I demand, then, that the examination shall take place as soon as possible, and I will furnish the house with all necessary information.\" \"What day do you fix?\" asked the president. \"To-day I am at your service,\" replied the count. The president rang the bell. \"Does the House approve that the examination should take place to-day?\" \"Yes,\" was the unanimous answer. A committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by Morcerf. The investigation would begin at eight o\u0027clock that evening in the committee-room, and if postponement were necessary, the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour. Morcerf asked leave to retire; he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm, which his sagacity had foreseen. Albert listened, trembling now with hope, then with anger, and then again with shame, for from Beauchamp\u0027s confidence he knew his father was guilty, and he asked himself how, since he was guilty, he could prove his innocence. Beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative. \"What next?\" asked Albert. \"What next? My friend, you impose a painful task on me. Must you know all?\" \"Absolutely; and rather from your lips than another\u0027s.\" \"Muster up all your courage, then, for never have you required it more.\" Albert passed his hand over his forehead, as if to try his strength, as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword. He thought himself strong enough, for he mistook fever for energy. \"Go on,\" said he. \"The evening arrived; all Paris was in expectation. Many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him; many others said he would not appear; while some asserted that they had seen him start for Brussels; and others went to the police-office to inquire if he had taken out a passport. I used all my influence with one of the committee, a young peer of my acquaintance, to get admission to one of the galleries. He called for me at seven o\u0027clock, and, before any one had arrived, asked one of the door-keepers to place me in a box. I was concealed by a column, and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place. At eight o\u0027clock all were in their places, and M. de Morcerf entered at the last stroke. He held some papers in his hand; his countenance was calm, and his step firm, and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform, which was buttoned completely up to the chin. His presence produced a good effect. The committee was made up of Liberals, several of whom came forward to shake hands with him.\" Albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars, but gratitude mingled with his sorrow: he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked. \"At this moment one of the door-keepers brought in a letter for the president. \u0027You are at liberty to speak, M. de Morcerf,\u0027 said the president, as he unsealed the letter; and the count began his defence, I assure you, Albert, in a most eloquent and skilful manner. He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence, since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor. He produced the ring, his mark of authority, with which Ali Pasha generally sealed his letters, and which the latter had given him, that he might, on his return at any hour of the day or night, gain access to the presence, even in the harem. Unfortunately, the negotiation failed, and when he returned to defend his benefactor, he was dead. \u0027But,\u0027 said the count, \u0027so great was Ali Pasha\u0027s confidence, that on his death-bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care.\u0027\" Albert started on hearing these words; the history of Haidée recurred to him, and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring, and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave. \"And what effect did this discourse produce?\" anxiously inquired Albert. \"I acknowledge it affected me, and, indeed, all the committee also,\" said Beauchamp. \"Meanwhile, the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him; but the first lines aroused his attention; he read them again and again, and fixing his eyes on M. de Morcerf, \u0027Count,\u0027 said he, \u0027you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care?\u0027--\u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 replied Morcerf; \u0027but in that, like all the rest, misfortune pursued me. On my return, Vasiliki and her daughter Haidée had disappeared.\u0027--\u0027Did you know them?\u0027--\u0027My intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them, and I had seen them above twenty times.\u0027 \"\u0027Have you any idea what became of them?\u0027--\u0027Yes, sir; I heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow, and, perhaps, to their poverty. I was not rich; my life was in constant danger; I could not seek them, to my great regret.\u0027 The president frowned imperceptibly. \u0027Gentlemen,\u0027 said he, \u0027you have heard the Comte de Morcerf\u0027s defence. Can you, sir, produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?\u0027--\u0027Alas, no, monsieur,\u0027 replied the count; \u0027all those who surrounded the vizier, or who knew me at his court, are either dead or gone away, I know not where. I believe that I alone, of all my countrymen, survived that dreadful war. I have only the letters of Ali Tepelini, which I have placed before you; the ring, a token of his good-will, which is here; and, lastly, the most convincing proof I can offer, after an anonymous attack, and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life.\u0027 A murmur of approbation ran through the assembly; and at this moment, Albert, had nothing more transpired, your father\u0027s cause had been gained. It only remained to put it to the vote, when the president resumed: \u0027Gentlemen and you, monsieur,--you will not be displeased, I presume, to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness, and who has just presented himself. He is, doubtless, come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague. Here is a letter I have just received on the subject; shall it be read, or shall it be passed over? and shall we take no notice of this incident?\u0027 M. de Morcerf turned pale, and clinched his hands on the papers he held. The committee decided to hear the letter; the count was thoughtful and silent. The president read:-- \"\u0027MR. PRESIDENT,--I can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the Lieutenant-General the Count of Morcerf in Epirus and in Macedonia with important particulars.\u0027 \"The president paused, and the count turned pale. The president looked at his auditors. \u0027Proceed,\u0027 was heard on all sides. The president resumed:-- \"\u0027I was on the spot at the death of Ali Pasha. I was present during his last moments. I know what is become of Vasiliki and Haidée. I am at the command of the committee, and even claim the honor of being heard. I shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you.\u0027 \"\u0027And who is this witness, or rather this enemy?\u0027 asked the count, in a tone in which there was a visible alteration. \u0027We shall know, sir,\u0027 replied the president. \u0027Is the committee willing to hear this witness?\u0027--\u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 they all said at once. The door-keeper was called. \u0027Is there any one in the lobby?\u0027 said the president. \"\u0027Yes, sir.\u0027--\u0027Who is it?\u0027--\u0027A woman, accompanied by a servant.\u0027 Every one looked at his neighbor. \u0027Bring her in,\u0027 said the president. Five minutes after the door-keeper again appeared; all eyes were fixed on the door, and I,\" said Beauchamp, \"shared the general expectation and anxiety. Behind the door-keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil, which completely concealed her. It was evident, from her figure and the perfumes she had about her, that she was young and fastidious in her tastes, but that was all. The president requested her to throw aside her veil, and it was then seen that she was dressed in the Grecian costume, and was remarkably beautiful.\" \"Ah,\" said Albert, \"it was she.\" \"Who?\" \"Haidée.\" \"Who told you that?\" \"Alas, I guess it. But go on, Beauchamp. You see I am calm and strong. And yet we must be drawing near the disclosure.\" \"M. de Morcerf,\" continued Beauchamp, \"looked at this woman with surprise and terror. Her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death. To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious, that the interest they had felt for the count\u0027s safety became now quite a secondary matter. The president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady; but she declined availing herself of it. As for the count, he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs refused to support him. \"\u0027Madame,\u0027 said the president, \u0027you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at Yanina, and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the event.\u0027--\u0027I was, indeed,\u0027 said the stranger, with a tone of sweet melancholy, and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East. \"\u0027But allow me to say that you must have been very young then.\u0027--\u0027I was four years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single detail has escaped my memory.\u0027--\u0027In what manner could these events concern you? and who are you, that they should have made so deep an impression on you?\u0027--\u0027On them depended my father\u0027s life,\u0027 replied she. \u0027I am Haidée, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of Vasiliki, his beloved wife.\u0027 \"The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly important communication, produced an indescribable effect on the assembly. As for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him. \u0027Madame,\u0027 replied the president, bowing with profound respect, \u0027allow me to ask one question; it shall be the last: Can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated?\u0027--\u0027I can, sir,\u0027 said Haidée, drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed; \u0027for here is the register of my birth, signed by my father and his principal officers, and that of my baptism, my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother\u0027s faith,--this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus; and lastly (and perhaps the most important), the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by the French officer, who, in his infamous bargain with the Porte, had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor, whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs.\u0027 A greenish pallor spread over the count\u0027s cheeks, and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations, which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence. \"Haidée, still calm, but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been, handed to the president the record of her sale, written in Arabic. It had been supposed some of the papers might be in the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of the House was in attendance. One of the noble peers, who was familiar with the Arabic language, having studied it during the famous Egyptian campaign, followed with his eye as the translator read aloud:-- \"\u0027I, El-Kobbir, a slave-merchant, and purveyor of the harem of his highness, acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor, from the French lord, the Count of Monte Cristo, an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand francs; as the ransom of a young Christian slave of eleven years of age, named Haidée, the acknowledged daughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of Vasiliki, his favorite; she having been sold to me seven years previously, with her mother, who had died on arriving at Constantinople, by a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali Tepelini, named Fernand Mondego. The above-mentioned purchase was made on his highness\u0027s account, whose mandate I had, for the sum of four hundred thousand francs. \"\u0027Given at Constantinople, by authority of his highness, in the year 1247 of the Hegira. \"\u0027Signed EL-KOBBIR.\u0027 \"\u0027That this record should have all due authority, it shall bear the imperial seal, which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it.\u0027 \"Near the merchant\u0027s signature there was, indeed, the seal of the sublime emperor. A dreadful silence followed the reading of this document; the count could only stare, and his gaze, fixed as if unconsciously on Haidée, seemed one of fire and blood. \u0027Madame,\u0027 said the president, \u0027may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo, who is now, I believe, in Paris?\u0027--\u0027Sir,\u0027 replied Haidée, \u0027the Count of Monte Cristo, my foster-father, has been in Normandy the last three days.\u0027 \"\u0027Who, then, has counselled you to take this step, one for which the court is deeply indebted to you, and which is perfectly natural, considering your birth and your misfortunes?\u0027--\u0027Sir,\u0027 replied Haidée, \u0027I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief. Although a Christian, may God forgive me, I have always sought to revenge my illustrious father. Since I set my foot in France, and knew the traitor lived in Paris, I have watched carefully. I live retired in the house of my noble protector, but I do it from choice. I love retirement and silence, because I can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days. But the Count of Monte Cristo surrounds me with every paternal care, and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world. I learn all in the silence of my apartments,--for instance, I see all the newspapers, every periodical, as well as every new piece of music; and by thus watching the course of the life of others, I learned what had transpired this morning in the House of Peers, and what was to take place this evening; then I wrote.\u0027 \"\u0027Then,\u0027 remarked the president, \u0027the Count of Monte Cristo knows nothing of your present proceedings?\u0027--\u0027He is quite unaware of them, and I have but one fear, which is that he should disapprove of what I have done. But it is a glorious day for me,\u0027 continued the young girl, raising her ardent gaze to heaven, \u0027that on which I find at last an opportunity of avenging my father!\u0027 \"The count had not uttered one word the whole of this time. His colleagues looked at him, and doubtless pitied his prospects, blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman. His misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance. \u0027M. de Morcerf,\u0027 said the president, \u0027do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina?\u0027--\u0027No,\u0027 said Morcerf, attempting to rise, \u0027it is a base plot, contrived by my enemies.\u0027 Haidée, whose eyes had been fixed on the door, as if expecting some one, turned hastily, and, seeing the count standing, shrieked, \u0027You do not know me?\u0027 said she. \u0027Well, I fortunately recognize you! You are Fernand Mondego, the French officer who led the troops of my noble father! It is you who surrendered the castle of Yanina! It is you who, sent by him to Constantinople, to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor, brought back a false mandate granting full pardon! It is you who, with that mandate, obtained the pasha\u0027s ring, which gave you authority over Selim, the fire-keeper! It is you who stabbed Selim. It is you who sold us, my mother and me, to the merchant, El-Kobbir! Assassin, assassin, assassin, you have still on your brow your master\u0027s blood! Look, gentlemen, all!\u0027 \"These words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth, that every eye was fixed on the count\u0027s forehead, and he himself passed his hand across it, as if he felt Ali\u0027s blood still lingering there. \u0027You positively recognize M. de Morcerf as the officer, Fernand Mondego?\u0027--\u0027Indeed I do!\u0027 cried Haidée. \u0027Oh, my mother, it was you who said, \"You were free, you had a beloved father, you were destined to be almost a queen. Look well at that man; it is he who raised your father\u0027s head on the point of a spear; it is he who sold us; it is he who forsook us! Look well at his right hand, on which he has a large wound; if you forgot his features, you would know him by that hand, into which fell, one by one, the gold pieces of the merchant El-Kobbir!\" I know him! Ah, let him say now if he does not recognize me!\u0027 Each word fell like a dagger on Morcerf, and deprived him of a portion of his energy; as she uttered the last, he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom, and fell back on his seat, overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair. This scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count. \"\u0027Count of Morcerf,\u0027 said the president, \u0027do not allow yourself to be cast down; answer. The justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of God; it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself. Shall further inquiries be made? Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina? Speak!\u0027 Morcerf did not reply. Then all the members looked at each other with terror. They knew the count\u0027s energetic and violent temper; it must be, indeed, a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself. They expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery outburst. \u0027Well,\u0027 asked the president, \u0027what is your decision?\u0027 \"\u0027I have no reply to make,\u0027 said the count in a low tone. \"\u0027Has the daughter of Ali Tepelini spoken the truth?\u0027 said the president. \u0027Is she, then, the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead \"Not guilty\"? Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused?\u0027 The count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers, but which could not disarm his judges. Then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling, but withdrew then, immediately, as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven, and that other judge named God. Then, with a hasty movement, he tore open his coat, which seemed to stifle him, and flew from the room like a madman; his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor, then the rattling of his carriage-wheels as he was driven rapidly away. \u0027Gentlemen,\u0027 said the president, when silence was restored, \u0027is the Count of Morcerf convicted of felony, treason, and conduct unbecoming a member of this House?\u0027--\u0027Yes,\u0027 replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice. 早晨八点钟，阿尔贝象一个霹雳似的落到波尚的门前。仆人早已受到吩咐，领他到他主人的寝室里，主人正在洗澡。 “怎么样？”阿尔贝说。 “怎么样？我可怜的朋友，？波尚答道，“我正在等待你。” “我一到就过来了。不用告诉我，波尚，我相信你是守信义讲交情的，决不会向任何人谈及那件事，——不会的，我的朋友。而且，你派人来找我，就是你关心我的一个最好的证明。所以，不要浪费时间了，告诉我吧，你能不能猜到这个可怕的打击是从哪儿来的？” “我可以立刻用两个字告诉你。” “但先把这个可耻阴谋的一切细节讲给我听吧。” 波尚于是向那被羞辱和痛苦折磨着的青年开始叙述下面这些事实：两天以前，那则消息在另一家报纸——并不是在《大公报》上——出现，而更严重的是，那家报纸是大家都知道的政府机关报。波尚读到那段新闻的时候正在用早膳，他立刻派人叫了一辆轻便马车，不等吃完早餐，就赶到报馆去。 波尚的主张虽然与那家报纸的编辑正好相反，可是他们倒是亲密的朋友，这原是常有的事。那位编辑正在津津有味地读报上一篇论甜菜问题文章，那篇文章大概是他自己写的。 “啊，真好！”波尚说，“既然你手里拿着报纸，我的朋友，我就不必告诉你我这次拜访的原因。” “难道你也关心食糖问题了吗？”那家政府报纸的编辑问道。 “不，”波尚回答，“对这个问题，我完全是个外行，我所关心的是一个性质完全不同的问题。” “什么问题？” “那篇关于马尔塞夫的文章。” “真的！那不是一件怪事吗？” “我认为你冒着很大的危险，因为很有可能被控为破坏名誉罪。” “决不会的，我们除了那则消息以外，还同时拿到一切必需的证据，我们确信马尔塞夫先生不会向我们抗议。此外，把那些不值得享受国家所赐尊荣的奸恶歹徒揭露出来，也算是报效祖国。” 波尚犹如五雷轰顶，“那末，是谁来这样正式地通知你的呢？”他问道。“这件事情是我的报纸先发动的，但由于证据不足，不得不停止刊载，其实对揭露马尔塞夫先生这件事，更感兴趣的应该是我们，因为他是法国贵族院的一个议员，而我们是反对派。” “噢！这是非常简单的，那则诽谤消息不是我们去找来的，而是它自己上门来的。昨天一个从从亚尼纳来的人，带来了那些可怕的东西，当我们对于发表那篇告发性的文章表示犹豫时，他对我们说，假如我们拒绝，那篇文章就会在别家报纸上出现。” 波尚知道除了忍气吞声以外再没有别的办法，就离开报馆派人去找马尔塞夫。但他却不能把下面这些事情通知阿尔贝，因为这些事情是信差离开以后才发生的：那天，一向冷清的贵族院里也显出了很大的骚动。每一个人都比往常到得早，纷纷谈论着这不祥的事情，因为这件事会使大众的注意力全都集中到他们这个显赫机构里的一个最著名的议员。有些人在细读那则消息，有些人在发表议论，追述附和这种攻击的往事。伯爵与他的同僚们并不融洽。象一切暴发户一样，他以前经常装出一种过份的骄傲以维持他的地位。老贵族嘲笑他；才智之士排斥他；德高望重的人本能地厌恶他。伯爵陷入了祭坛上的牺牲品似的惨境。一旦被上帝的手指为牺牲品，每一个人便都要攻击他了。 只有马尔塞夫伯爵不知道当日所发生的事情。他没有看到那份登载诽谤消息的报纸，以写信和骑马度过了早晨的时光。所以他在往常的时间到达议会，仍带着一种骄横的神色和傲慢的态度：他下车，经过走廊，进入议院，并没有注意到听差的迟疑和他同僚的冷淡。会议在他到达半小时前就已经开始了。虽然伯爵的神态和举止都未改变，——我们已经说过，他对于当日的事情毫不知情，——但在旁人看来，他的态度和举止似乎比往常更显得傲慢不逊；他的出席被视作对议会的一种挑衅，以致全体议员都为议院的尊严受到侮辱而深感愤怒；有些人认为这是一种失礼；有些人认为这是一种目中无人；有些人则认为是一种侮辱。整个议院虽然都急于想开始辩论；但象往常一样，谁都不愿意担起为难的责任。 最后，一个令人尊敬的议员，马尔塞夫的知名敌人，带着庄严的神色跨上讲台。这表示预期的时间已经到了，议院里顿时鸦雀无声；只有马尔塞夫不知道这个一向并不如此受重视的演讲者会受到这样重视的原因。发言者宣称他有非常重要的消息要报告，要求全场一致注意，伯爵对这一段开场白并未予以特别注意；但当听到亚尼纳和弗尔南多上校的时候，他的脸色就变得那令人可怕地苍白，以致每一个议员都打了一个寒颤，所有眼光都集中到他身上。精神上的创伤就有这种特性，——它可以被掩盖起来，但却决不会收口；它是永远痛苦的，被触及就会流血，永远鲜血淋漓地留在心头。 他的演说在鸦雀无声的会场里进行下去，只偶尔被一阵阵叹息声所打断，当他继续讲下去时，全场又肃静下来，他讲到他为这件事感到不安，查明这件案子，任务相当艰巨。他之所以要引起一场私人问题的辩论，是为了要保全马尔塞夫先生的个人名誉和整个议院的名誉。他的结论是要求立即进行一次审查，以使谣传尽快被挫败，不令其散布出去，借此恢复马尔塞夫先生在舆论界所长期建立的地位。 这个意想不到的横祸是这样的打倒了马尔塞夫，以致当他带着一种迷惑不解的表情环顾全场的时候，他简直说不出一句话来，这种胆怯的表情既可以看做是无辜者过分受惊，也可以说是自愧有罪者的表现，这种态度为他赢得了一部分同情，——因为真正宽厚仁义的人当见到他们敌人的不幸超过他们仇恨的范围时，总是会发生同情的。主席把这件事付诸表决，结果决定应该进行审查。主席问伯爵需要多少时间来准备他的辩护。马尔塞夫发现在经受这个可怕的打击以后居然还活着，他的勇气便恢复了。“诸位勋爵，”他答说，“对于这由敌人暗中指使的攻击，是不能靠时间来反击的，我必须立刻用一个霹雳来答复那曾暂时使我吓了一跳的闪电。噢！我不但能辩护，而且将流近我最后的一滴血，向我高贵的同僚们证明我无愧于与他们为伍！”这番话使人产生了一种对被告有利的印象。“所以，我要求审查应该尽可能赶快举行，我应当把一切必需的资料提供给院方参考。” “您指定哪一天？”主席问。 “从今天起，我悉听院方处置。”伯爵回答。 主席摇了摇铃。“是否全体同意今天就举行审查？” “同意！”全场一致回答。 议院选出了一个十二人委员会来审查马尔塞夫所提出的证据。审查委员会决定当天晚上八点在小组会议室里开会：如果有必要继续，每天晚上在同样时间开会。马尔塞夫要求退席，他得去搜集那些他早就准备着以便应付这种风波的证据，他的机警使他预料到这种风暴的可能性。 波尚把我们现在所叙述的这一切事情详详细细地讲给那阿尔贝听；他的叙述当然更比我们富于生气，因为当时事件正在演变中，而现在则已事过境迁。阿尔贝浑身都在颤抖着，有时抱着希望，有时愤怒，有时又羞愧，——因为凭他对波尚的信任，他知道他的父亲是有罪的；而他自问，既然他是有罪的，他又如何能证明他的无辜。波尚迟疑着不再叙述下去。 “以后呢？”阿尔贝问。 “以后？我的朋友，你给了我一件痛苦的工作了。你一定要全部知道吗？” “绝对要，与其从别人的嘴里知道，还不如从你的嘴里知道的好。” “那末，请你做好精神准备，因为这是需要勇气的时候了。” 阿尔贝伸手摸一摸自己的额头，象是在证明自己的精力，象一个人在准备防卫他生命的时候试一试他的盾和弯一弯他的剑一样。他以为自己很强壮，因为他把自己的激动情绪误认作力量了。“讲下去。”他说。 “那天晚上，”波尚继续说，“全巴黎在等待消息。许多人说，只有你的父亲出面才能使指控不攻自破，许多人说他不会出席，有些人斩钉截铁地说，他们亲眼看见他动身到布鲁塞尔去了，也有人到警察局去查问他有没有去领护照。我认识一个年轻的贵族，他也是审查委员之一，我竭力恳求他给我一个旁听的机会。他在七点钟的时候来找我，在趁开会的人还没来，要求一个听差把我藏在一间边厢里。我躲在一根圆柱后面，希望能全部目击这一切。八点正，大家都已到齐了，马尔塞夫先生在时钟敲到最后一下的时候走了进来。他的手里拿着一些文件，看上去脸色平静，脚步坚定，衣服漂亮而不浮华。根据老军人的习惯，他的上装一直扣到颈下。他的出场产生了一个良好的效果。审查委员会是由中立人士组成的，其中有几个上前来与他握手。” 阿尔贝在听这些事情的时候，觉得他的心快要爆炸了，但在他的忧伤之中混杂着感情。他很愿意能拥抱一下那些在他父亲的名誉受到这样一些攻击的时候还能给他这种敬意的人。 “这时，一个听差拿了一封信来交给主席。‘您可以发言了，马尔塞夫先生，’主席一面说，一面拆开那封信，于是伯爵开始为自己辩护起来。我敢向你保证，阿尔贝，他的辩护是最雄辩和最有技巧的。拿出文件证明亚尼纳总督到最后一刻是对他全部信任的，因为他曾要派他去和土耳其皇帝作一次生死攸关的谈判。他拿出那只戒指，这是阿里总督的权威的像征，他常常用这只戒指来作为他的信物，阿里总督给他这只戒指的用意，就是为了当他回来的时候，不论日夜，不论任何时间，可以凭此直接去见他，甚至到他的寝室去见他。不幸的是，他说，那次谈判失败了，而当他回来保卫他的恩主的时候，他已经死了。‘但是，’伯爵说，‘阿里总督对我是这样的信任，甚至在他临死的时候，他还把他的宠妾和他的女儿托我照顾。’” 阿尔贝听到这几句话，不觉吃了一惊。他想起海黛的身世来了，他还记得她讲述那个使者和那只戒指时所说的话，以及她被出卖和变成一个奴隶的经过。“这一段话产生了什么影响呢？”阿尔贝急切地问。 “我承认这段话感动了我，也的确感动了全体委员，”波尚说。“这时，主席漫不经心地阅读那封送来的信，开头那几行就引起了他的注意。他把那几行读了读，然后眼睛盯住马尔塞夫先生。‘伯爵阁下，’他说，‘您说亚尼纳总督曾把他的妻女托付给了你照顾？’‘是的，阁下，’马尔塞夫答道，‘但在那件事情上，象在其他一切事情上一样，不幸总追赶着我，当我回去的时候，凡瑟丽姬和她的女儿海黛已失踪了。’‘你认识她们吗？’‘我和总督的密切关系以及他对我的忠诚的无限信任使我见过她们二十多次。’‘您知道她们后来的下落吗？’‘是的，阁下，我听说她们已很忧伤，或许是沦为贫穷的牺牲品。我并不富有，我的生命经常在危险中。我不能去寻找她们，这是我非常遗憾的。’主席让人难以觉察地皱了皱眉头。‘诸位，’他说，‘你们已听到马尔塞夫伯爵阁下的解释了。伯爵阁下，您能提供出证人来证实您所说的话吗？’‘唉！不能，阁下，’伯爵答道，总督周围的人物，或是朝廷里认识我的人，不是过世就是走散了。我相信，在我的同胞人之中，只有我一个人经历了那场可怕的战争还依旧活着。我只有阿里·铁贝林的信件，现在已经呈交在您面前了，随那只作为信物的戒指，也在这儿了。最后，我所能提供的最有力的证据，就是：在一次匿名的攻击以后，并没有一个证人可以站出来否定我是一个正直和诚实的人以及一个纯洁的军人。全场发出一阵低低赞许声。这时，阿尔贝，假如再没有别的事情发生，只要经过最后一次表决，你的父亲便可以胜利了。但主席又说：‘诸位，还有您，伯爵阁下，我想，你们大概不会反对听取一个自称为非常重要的证人的证词。这个证人是他自己找上门来的，而在听了伯爵刚才的一番话以后，我们知道他是为证明我们这位同僚是无辜而来的。这封刚才收到的信就是关于那件事的。我们是否应该把它读一读呢，还是应该把它搁在一边，只当没有那回事？’马尔塞夫先生的脸色变得苍白了，抓住文件的那只手紧紧地捏成了拳头。委员会决定听一听那封信的内容，伯爵默不出声，装出沉思的样子。主席读道：‘主席阁下：我能向审查委员会提供非常确实的资料来证实马尔塞夫中将伯爵在伊皮鲁斯和马其顿的行为。’主席顿了一顿，伯爵的脸更苍白了。主席望了一眼他的听众们。‘念下去。’四面八方都是这样说。主席继续道：‘阿里总督临终的时候我也在场；我亲眼看到他临终时的情形，我知道凡瑟丽姬和海黛的结果。我可以悉听委员会的吩咐，甚至要求赐我作证的光荣。当这封信交到您手里的时候，我已在外厅等候了。’“‘这个证人，或说得更准确些，这个敌人究竟是谁呢？’伯爵问道，他的语气明显地改变了。‘我们就要知道的，阁下，’主席答道，‘委员会愿意听这位证人的陈述吗？’‘要听，要听。’他们都同时说。主席把听差叫来，问他：‘外厅里有没有人！’‘有的，先生。’‘是什么人？’‘一个女人，有一个仆人陪着。’每一个人都面面相觑。‘领那个女人来。’主席说。五分钟以后，听差又出现了。所有的眼睛都盯住了门口，包括我，”波尚说，“也跟大家一样的期望和焦急。在听差的后面，走进来一位遮着一张大面纱的女人。那张面纱完全遮住了她的脸，但从她的身材和她身上的香气判断，她显然是一个年轻而高雅的女人。主席要求她揭开面纱，到那时，大家才看到她穿着希腊人的装束，而且极其美丽。” “啊！”阿尔贝说，“这是她。” “她？谁？” “海黛。” “谁告诉你的？” “唉！我知道了。说下去吧，波尚。你看得出我很镇定坚强，我们一定很快就可以知道真相的。” “马尔塞夫先生惊奇而恐怖地望着这个女人。”波尚继续说。“她说出来的话将要关系他的生或死了。全体委员觉得这个插曲是这样的离奇，以致他们现在把伯爵的安危问题看作了次要的事情。主席亲自端了一把椅子给那青年女子，但她并没有坐下。至于伯爵，他早已经跌倒在他的椅子里了，显然他的两腿已经支持不住了。 “‘夫人，’主席说，‘您自称能向委员会提供关于亚尼纳事件的资料，并声称您是亲眼目击那些事件的证人。’‘我的确是的！’那陌生女子用一种甜蜜而抑郁的口气和那种专门属于东方人的悦耳的声音说。‘请允许我说，您那时一定还非常年幼吧。’我那时才四岁，但因为那些事情和我有密切的关系，所以没有一件事情会逃出我的记忆。’‘那些事情跟您是怎样的关系呢？你是谁，怎么会对那些事情有这样深刻的印象呢？’‘那些事情关系着我父亲的生死，’她答道。‘我是海黛，是亚尼纳总督阿里·铁贝林和他的爱妻凡瑟丽姬的女儿。’“交杂着骄傲和谦逊的红晕顿时涨满了那位青年女子的两颊，再加上她那明亮的眼睛和她那充满尊严的一段话，在全场上产生了一种难以形容的影响。至于伯爵，即使一个霹雳打在他的脚下和深裂开在他的面前，也不能使他更惶惑了。‘夫人，’是主席非常恭敬地鞠了一躬说道，‘允许我提出一个问题，——这是最后的一个问题了：您能证明您现在所说的这一番话的真实性吗？’‘我能的，阁下，’海黛说，从她的面纱底下摸出一只异香扑鼻的小包来，‘这儿是我的出生证明书，是我父亲亲笔写并且由他的高级官吏签署的，还有我的受洗证书，因为我的父亲同意我可以信我母亲的宗教。这张受洗证上有马其顿和伊皮鲁斯大主教的签署。最后——而这无疑地是最主要的——，还有那个法国军官把我和我的母亲卖给亚美尼亚奴隶商艾尔考柏的卖身文契，那个法国军官在他与土耳其政府的无耻的交易中，竟把他恩主的妻子和女儿作为他的一部分战利品，把她们卖了，得到四十万法郎。’全场在一种可怕的寂静中倾听这一番惊心动魄的谴责，伯爵的两颊泛出青白色，他的眼睛充满了血丝。海黛依旧很镇定，但这宁静却比别人的愤怒更可怕，她把那张用阿拉伯文写的卖身契交给主席。在这些证件之中，有些大概是用阿拉伯文、罗马文或土耳其文写的，因为议院的译员已被传唤了上去。有一个议员曾在伟大的埃及战争中研究过阿拉伯语，在他的监视之下，那译员高声读道： “我，艾尔考柏，一个奴隶商人，皇帝陛下的纳妃使者，承认代皇帝陛下从自由贵族基督山伯爵手里收到一颗价值二千袋钱中的绿宝石，作为一个十一岁的幼年基督徒奴隶的赎金。这个奴隶名叫海黛，是故亚尼纳总督阿里·铁贝林勋爵及其宠妾凡瑟丽姬的女儿。她是七年以前和她的母亲一起卖给我的，但她的母亲在到达君士坦丁堡的时候即已去世。原售是一个代阿里·铁贝林总督手下服务的法国上校，名叫弗尔南多·蒙台哥。上述的交易由我代表皇帝陛下付出一千袋钱币。本约已经皇帝陛下批准，地点君士坦丁堡，时间回教纪元一二四七年——签字艾尔考柏。‘此约应办齐一切批准手续，应由售主备盖皇帝御玺。’“在那奴隶贩子的签字旁边，的确有土耳其大皇帝的御玺的印记。这个文件读完以后，会议室内接着就陷入一种可怕的沉默里。伯爵完全楞住了。他那象是下意识地盯住海黛的眼睛已经变成了一团火与血。‘夫人，’主席说，‘我们能向基督山伯爵去调查一下吗？我相信他现在也在巴黎吧。’‘阁下，’海黛答道，‘我的再生之父基督山伯爵在三天以前已到诺曼底去了。’那样是谁建议采取这个步骤的呢？——当然罗，对于您这个步骤本庭深表感谢，而且，对于您的身世和您的不幸遭遇来说，这原是十分自然的。’‘阁下，’海黛回答，‘这个步骤是我的自尊心和我的悲哀促使我采取的。相信上帝宽恕我，虽然我是一个基督徒，但我却老是想为我那英名显赫的父亲复仇。自从我来到法国，并且知道那叛徒住在巴黎以来，我就时时小心地注意着。我隐居在我那高贵的保护人家里，但这是我自愿的。我喜欢静居和寂寞，因为我能靠我的思想和我对过去的日子的回忆生活。基督山伯爵象慈父般地对我爱护备至，我对于外界的事情无所不知，虽然我是在我的卧室里观看这一切。比方说，我看每一种报纸、每一种期刊和每一个新歌剧。就在这样注视旁人生活的时候，我知道了今天早晨贵族院里所发生的事情，以及今天晚上将要发生的事情，于是我就写了那封信。’‘那末，’主席说，‘基督山伯爵对于您现在的行为毫不知情的吗？’‘他完全不知道，我只怕一件事，就是怕他会不赞成我现在所做的一切。但今天是我感到最高兴的一天，’那女郎用那火热的眼睛凝视着天空，继续说，‘今天，我终于找到一个机会来为我的父亲复仇了！’” “在这期间，伯爵没有出过一次声，说过一句话。他的同僚们望着他，对他那被一个女人的芬芳的气息所打破的好景感到有些怜悯。他脸上那种阴险的皱纹勾勒出了他的痛苦。‘马尔塞夫阁下，’主席说，‘你认识这位太太吗？她是不是亚尼纳总督阿里·铁贝林的女儿？’‘不，’马尔塞夫说，他挣扎着站起来，‘这是一个卑鄙的阴谋，是我的敌人设计出来的。’海黛本来用眼睛盯住门口，象是在期待着一个人进来似的，这时急忙转过头来，看到伯爵站在那儿，便发出一声恐怖的喊叫。‘你不认识我？’她说。‘哼，幸亏我还认识你！你是弗尔南多·蒙台哥，那个指挥我那高贵父亲部下军队的法国军官！是你出卖了亚尼纳堡！是你受命到君士坦相堡去和土耳其皇帝谈判关系到你恩主的生死问题而带回来一个假造的赦免状！是你骗取总督戒指去获得了守火者西立姆的信任！是你刺杀了西立姆！是你把我们，我的母亲和我，出卖给奴隶贩子艾尔考柏！凶手！凶手！凶手！你的额头上还沾着你主子的血呢。看，诸位，大家看！’“这些话产生了巨大的说服力，每一双眼睛都盯着伯爵的额头上。他自己竟也用手去抹了一抹，好象自己也觉得阿里的血依旧还粘在上面似的。‘您确实认定马尔塞夫先生就是那个军官弗尔南多·蒙台哥吗？’‘我确实认得！’海黛喊道。‘噢，我的母亲呀！曾经告诉我说：“你本来是自由的，你有一个疼爱你的爹爹，你本来可以成为一个皇后。仔细看清楚那个人。是他使你变成了一个奴隶，是他把你父亲的头颅挑在枪尖上，是他出卖了我们，是他把我们交给那个奴隶贩子！仔细看看他的右手，那只手上有一个大伤疤，假如你忘记了他的面貌，你一看那只手就可以认识他，奴隶贩子艾尔考柏的金洋便是一块一块地落到那只带有伤疤的手里！“我认不认识他？啊！现在让他说说看，他怎么能说不认识我！’每一个字都象一把匕首似的插入马尔塞夫的心，每一个字都推毁他的一部分精力。当她说出最后那一句话的时候，他急忙把他的手藏在胸怀里（他的手上的确有一个大伤疤），满脸绝望地跌回到他的座位上，这情景改变了全场对伯爵的意见。‘马尔塞夫伯爵阁下，’主席说，‘您就难道被压倒了吗？答辩吧。本庭大公无私，并且具有最高的权力，就象上帝的法庭一样，本庭决不能使你横受敌人的践踏而不给您一个反抗的机会。要不要再继续进行调查？要不要派两位议员到亚尼纳去？说呀！’马尔塞夫不回答。于是全体议员都带着一种惊恐的表情面面相觑。他们知道伯爵的脾气暴戾强横。必须是一个致命的打击才能剥夺他反抗的勇气。他们以为这个沉默象是一次暴风雨的前兆，预示将接着出现一个霹雳似的惊醒。‘唉’主席问道，‘您决定怎么样？’‘我没有话回答。’伯爵站起来低声说。‘那末，阿里·铁贝林的女儿所说的都是实情吗？’主席说。‘看来，她是一个有利的证人，甚至使您不敢再说“无罪”吗？您真的犯了所控的那些罪吗？’伯爵环顾四周，他那种万般绝望的表情就是老虎看了也会心软，但却不能感动他的法官。于是，他抬头看天花板，但立刻又收回那种眼光，象是怕那屋顶裂开，使他痛苦地看到那被称为天庭的另一个法庭和那名叫上帝的另一位法官似的。于是，他以急促的动作撕开那件似乎要使他快要窒息的上衣，象一个可悲的疯子似的冲出房间。他的脚步声在走廊里响了一阵，然后他的马车隆隆地响起急速离开的声音。‘诸位，’当房间里恢复肃静的时候，主席说，‘马尔塞夫伯爵阁下是犯了叛逆罪和暴行迫害罪吗？’‘是的。’审查委员会的全体委员异口同声地回答。 “海黛一直等候到结束。当她听到宣判的时候，她并未露出十分高兴或怜悯的表情，然后，她用面纱遮住面孔，庄严地向委员们鞠了一躬，迈着象女神般庄严的步伐离开了会场。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/72/4004.html","bookId":545,"book":{"id":545,"title":"The Count of
