{"id":43956,"no":88,"title":"Chapter 93 Valentine","content":"WE MAY easily conceive where Morrel\u0027s appointment was. On leaving Monte Cristo he walked slowly towards Villefort\u0027s; we say slowly, for Morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps, but he had hastened to take leave of Monte Cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts. He knew his time well--the hour when Valentine was giving Noirtier his breakfast, and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty. Noirtier and Valentine had given him leave to go twice a week, and he was now availing himself of that permission. He had arrived; Valentine was expecting him. Uneasy and almost crazed, she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather. This uneasiness, amounting almost to frenzy, arose from the report Morcerf\u0027s adventure had made in the world, for the affair at the opera was generally known. No one at Villefort\u0027s doubted that a duel would ensue from it. Valentine, with her woman\u0027s instinct, guessed that Morrel would be Monte Cristo\u0027s second, and from the young man\u0027s well-known courage and his great affection for the count, she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him. We may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for, given, and received; and Morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved, when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected. \"Now,\" said Valentine, motioning to Morrel to sit down near her grandfather, while she took her seat on his footstool,--\"now let us talk about our own affairs. You know, Maximilian, grandpapa once thought of leaving this house, and taking an apartment away from M. de Villefort\u0027s.\" \"Yes,\" said Maximilian, \"I recollect the project, of which I highly approved.\" \"Well,\" said Valentine, \"you may approve again, for grandpapa is again thinking of it.\" \"Bravo,\" said Maximilian. \"And do you know,\" said Valentine, \"what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house.\" Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence, but she did not notice him; her looks, her eyes, her smile, were all for Morrel. \"Oh, whatever may be M. Noirtier\u0027s reason,\" answered Morrel, \"I can readily believe it to be a good one.\" \"An excellent one,\" said Valentine. \"He pretends the air of the Faubourg St. Honoré is not good for me.\" \"Indeed?\" said Morrel; \"in that M. Noirtier may be right; you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight.\" \"Not very,\" said Valentine. \"And grandpapa has become my physician, and I have the greatest confidence in him, because he knows everything.\" \"Do you then really suffer?\" asked Morrel quickly. \"Oh, it must not be called suffering; I feel a general uneasiness, that is all. I have lost my appetite, and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something.\" Noirtier did not lose a word of what Valentine said. \"And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint?\" \"A very simple one,\" said Valentine. \"I swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather. When I say one spoonful, I began by one--now I take four. Grandpapa says it is a panacea.\" Valentine smiled, but it was evident that she suffered. Maximilian, in his devotedness, gazed silently at her. She was very beautiful, but her usual pallor had increased; her eyes were more brilliant than ever, and her hands, which were generally white like mother-of-pearl, now more resembled wax, to which time was adding a yellowish hue. From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirtier. The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl, absorbed by her affection, and he also, like Morrel, followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of every one but the grandfather and the lover. \"But,\" said Morrel, \"I thought this mixture, of which you now take four spoonfuls, was prepared for M. Noirtier?\" \"I know it is very bitter,\" said Valentine; \"so bitter, that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same taste.\" Noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter. \"Yes, grandpapa,\" said Valentine; \"it is so. Just now, before I came down to you, I drank a glass of sugared water; I left half, because it seemed so bitter.\" Noirtier turned pale, and made a sign that he wished to speak. Valentine rose to fetch the dictionary. Noirtier watched her with evident anguish. In fact, the blood was rushing to the young girl\u0027s head already, her cheeks were becoming red. \"Oh,\" cried she, without losing any of her cheerfulness, \"this is singular! I can\u0027t see! Did the sun shine in my eyes?\" And she leaned against the window. \"The sun is not shining,\" said Morrel, more alarmed by Noirtier\u0027s expression than by Valentine\u0027s indisposition. He ran towards her. The young girl smiled. \"Cheer up,\" said she to Noirtier. \"Do not be alarmed, Maximilian; it is nothing, and has already passed away. But listen! Do I not hear a carriage in the court-yard?\" She opened Noirtier\u0027s door, ran to a window in the passage, and returned hastily. \"Yes,\" said she, \"it is Madame Danglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us. Good-by;--I must run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather, farewell till I see you again. Stay with grandpapa, Maximilian; I promise you not to persuade them to stay.\" Morrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to Madame de Villefort\u0027s apartments and to hers. As soon as she was gone, Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take the dictionary. Morrel obeyed; guided by Valentine, he had learned how to understand the old man quickly. Accustomed, however, as he was to the work, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words, \"Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from Valentine\u0027s room.\" Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois\u0027s situation, and in Noirtier\u0027s name gave that order. The servant soon returned. The decanter and the glass were completely empty. Noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak. \"Why are the glass and decanter empty?\" asked he; \"Valentine said she only drank half the glassful.\" The translation of this new question occupied another five minutes. \"I do not know,\" said the servant, \"but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle Valentine\u0027s room: perhaps she has emptied them.\" \"Ask her,\" said Morrel, translating Noirtier\u0027s thought this time by his look. The servant went out, but returned almost immediately. \"Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de Villefort\u0027s,\" said he; \"and in passing, as she was thirsty, she drank what remained in the glass; as for the decanter, Master Edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks.\" Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke. From that moment the old man\u0027s eyes were fixed on the door, and did not quit it. It was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen; they had been ushered into Madame de Villefort\u0027s room, who had said she would receive them there. That is why Valentine passed through her room, which was on a level with Valentine\u0027s, and only separated from it by Edward\u0027s. The two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication. Among worldly people manner is contagious. Madame de Villefort received them with equal solemnity. Valentine entered at this moment, and the formalities were resumed. \"My dear friend,\" said the baroness, while the two young people were shaking hands, \"I and Eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalcanti.\" Danglars kept up the title of prince. The popular banker found that it answered better than count. \"Allow me to present you my sincere congratulations,\" replied Madame de Villefort. \"Prince Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities.\" \"Listen,\" said the baroness, smiling; \"speaking to you as a friend I can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be. He has about him a little of that foreign manner by which French persons recognize, at first sight, the Italian or German nobleman. Besides, he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition, much keenness of wit, and as to suitability, M. Danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic--that is his word.\" \"And then,\" said Eugénie, while turning over the leaves of Madame de Villefort\u0027s album, \"add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man.\" \"And,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"I need not ask you if you share that fancy.\" \"I?\" replied Eugénie with her usual candor. \"Oh, not the least in the world, madame! My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares, or the caprices of any man, but to be an artist, and consequently free in heart, in person, and in thought.\" Eugénie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to Valentine\u0027s cheeks. The timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman. \"At any rate,\" said she, \"since I am to be married whether I will or not, I ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with M. Albert de Morcerf, or I should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man.\" \"It is true,\" said the baroness, with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies, and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive them,--\"it is very true that had not the Morcerfs hesitated, my daughter would have married Monsieur Albert. The general depended much on it; he even came to force M. Danglars. We have had a narrow escape.\" \"But,\" said Valentine, timidly, \"does all the father\u0027s shame revert upon the son? Monsieur Albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general.\" \"Excuse me,\" said the implacable young girl, \"Monsieur Albert claims and well deserves his share. It appears that after having challenged M. de Monte Cristo at the Opera yesterday, he apologized on the ground to-day.\" \"Impossible,\" said Madame de Villefort. \"Ah, my dear friend,\" said Madame Danglars, with the same simplicity we before noticed, \"it is a fact. I heard it from M. Debray, who was present at the explanation.\" Valentine also knew the truth, but she did not answer. A single word had reminded her that Morrel was expecting her in M. Noirtier\u0027s room. Deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation, Valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation. She would, indeed, have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes, when suddenly Madame Danglars\u0027 hand, pressed on her arm, aroused her from her lethargy. \"What is it?\" said she, starting at Madame Danglars, touch as she would have done from an electric shock. \"It is, my dear Valentine,\" said the baroness, \"that you are, doubtless, suffering.\" \"I?\" said the young girl, passing her hand across her burning forehead. \"Yes, look at yourself in that glass; you have turned pale and then red successively, three or four times in one minute.\" \"Indeed,\" cried Eugénie, \"you are very pale!\" \"Oh, do not be alarmed; I have been so for many days.\" Artless as she was, the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave, and besides, Madame de Villefort came to her assistance. \"Retire, Valentine,\" said she; \"you are really suffering, and these ladies will excuse you; drink a glass of pure water, it will restore you.\" Valentine kissed Eugénie, bowed to Madame Danglars, who had already risen to take her leave, and went out. \"That poor child,\" said Madame de Villefort when Valentine was gone, \"she makes me very uneasy, and I should not be astonished if she had some serious illness.\" Meanwhile, Valentine, in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand, had crossed Edward\u0027s room without noticing some trick of the child, and through her own had reached the little staircase. She was within three steps of the bottom; she already heard Morrel\u0027s voice, when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes, her stiffened foot missed the step, her hands had no power to hold the baluster, and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor. Morrel bounded to the door, opened it, and found Valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs. Quick as a flash, he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair. Valentine opened her eyes. \"Oh, what a clumsy thing I am,\" said she with feverish volubility; \"I don\u0027t know my way. I forgot there were three more steps before the landing.\" \"You have hurt yourself, perhaps,\" said Morrel. \"What can I do for you, Valentine?\" Valentine looked around her; she saw the deepest terror depicted in Noirtier\u0027s eyes. \"Don\u0027t worry, dear grandpapa,\" said she, endeavoring to smile; \"it is nothing--it is nothing; I was giddy, that is all.\" \"Another attack of giddiness,\" said Morrel, clasping his hands. \"Oh, attend to it, Valentine, I entreat you.\" \"But no,\" said Valentine,--\"no, I tell you it is all past, and it was nothing. Now, let me tell you some news; Eugénie is to be married in a week, and in three days there is to be a grand feast, a betrothal festival. We are all invited, my father, Madame de Villefort, and I--at least, I understood it so.\" \"When will it be our turn to think of these things? Oh, Valentine, you who have so much influence over your grandpapa, try to make him answer--Soon.\" \"And do you,\" said Valentine, \"depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa?\" \"Yes,\" cried Morrel, \"make haste. So long as you are not mine, Valentine, I shall always think I may lose you.\" 我们很容易推测到莫雷尔所说的事情以及他将要去见的人。离开基督山伯爵以后，他慢慢地向维尔福的家里走去；我们说“慢慢地”，因为他有半个多钟头的时间去走五百多步路，但他刚才之所以急于要离开基督山，是因为他希望要独自思索一会儿。他对于自己的时间知道得很清楚，——现在正是瓦朗蒂娜伺候诺瓦蒂埃用早餐的时候，而这种孝顺的行为当然不愿被人打扰的。诺瓦蒂埃和瓦朗蒂娜允许他每星期去两次，他现在正是利用那份权利。他到了，瓦朗蒂娜正在等着他。她不安地，几乎狂乱地抓住他的手，领他去见她的祖父。 这种几乎近于狂乱的不安是由马尔塞夫事件引起的；歌剧院里的那件事大家都已知道。维尔福家里的人谁都不会怀疑那件事情将引起一场决斗。瓦朗蒂娜凭着她那女性的直觉，猜到莫雷尔将做基督山的陪证人；而由于那青年的勇敢和他对伯爵的友谊，她恐怕他不会当个证人，袖手旁观。我们很容易想象得到，瓦朗蒂娜如何急切地问决斗的详细情形以及莫雷尔如何向她解释那一切，当瓦朗蒂娜知道这件事情得到这样一个意外可喜的结果时，莫雷尔从他爱人的眼睛里看一种无法形容的欢喜。 “现在，”瓦朗蒂娜示意请莫雷尔坐在她祖父的旁边，她自己也在祖父面前的小矮凳上坐下来，说，——“现在来谈谈我们之间的事情吧。你知道，马西米兰，爷爷有一阵了，曾经打算离开这座房子，与维尔福先生分开住。” “是的，”马西米兰说，“我记得那个计划，而且当时非常赞同那个计划。” “嗯，”瓦朗蒂娜说，“你现在又可以赞成了，因为爷爷又想到那个计划啦。” “好得很！”马西米兰说。 “你可知道爷爷要离开这座房子的理由吗？”瓦朗蒂娜说。 诺瓦蒂埃望着瓦朗蒂娜，意思是叫她不要说出来，但她并没有注意到这一切，她的表情，她的眼光，她的微笑，一切都为了莫雷尔。 “噢！不论诺瓦蒂埃先生是什么原因搬出去，”莫雷尔答道，“我相信一定是很有道理的。” “非常有道理！”瓦朗蒂娜说。“他的理由是圣·奥诺路的空气对我很适宜。” “说实话！”莫雷尔说，“那一点，诺瓦蒂埃先生或应该是对的，我发现两个星期以来你的身体变坏了。” “对，有点不好，这是真的，”瓦朗蒂娜说。“爷爷现在已成了我的私人医生了，我非常信任他，因为他什么都知道。” “那末你真的病了？”莫雷尔关心地问。 “哦，那不能说是病，我只是觉得周身不舒服。我没有食欲，我的胃象是在翻腾，象要消化什么食物似的。” 诺瓦蒂埃对瓦朗蒂娜所说的话一个字都没有漏过。 “你用什么方法来治疗这种怪病呢？” “非常简单，”瓦朗蒂娜说，“我每天早晨吃一匙羹给我祖父吃的那种药。我说一匙羹，——是说我开始的时候吃一匙羹，现在我吃四匙羹了。爷爷说那是一种万灵药。”瓦朗蒂娜微笑了一下，但她显然很忧郁和痛苦。 沉醉在爱情中的马西米兰默默地注视着她。她非常美丽，但她往常苍白的脸色现在更苍白了；她的眼睛比以前更明亮，而她的双手，本来象珍珠那样白的，现在则象陈年的白蜡那样有点泛黄了。马西米兰把眼光从瓦朗蒂娜移到诺瓦蒂埃身上。他正带着一种非常关切的神色望着他的青年女郎，他也象莫雷尔一样看出了这种病态的证状，这种病症虽然非常轻微，但却逃不过祖父和爱人的眼睛。 “但是，”莫雷尔说，“我想这种药，就是你现在吃四匙羹的那种药，本来是开给诺瓦蒂埃先生服用的吧？” “我知道它非常苦，”瓦朗蒂娜说，“苦得我以后不论喝什么东西似乎都带有这种苦涩。”诺瓦蒂埃疑问地望着他的孙女儿。“是的，爷爷，”瓦朗蒂娜说，“的确是这样。刚才，在我到你这来以前，我喝了一杯糖水，我只喝了一半，因为它似乎太苦了。” 诺瓦蒂埃的脸色变得苍白起来，示意他想说话。瓦朗蒂娜站起来去拿字典。诺瓦蒂埃带着显而易见的神色注视着她。 的确，血冲到那青年女郎的头部来了；她的两颊开始发红。 “噢！”她喊道，但还是很高兴，“这就怪了！一道亮光！是太阳照到我的眼睛了吗？”她靠在窗口。 “没有太阳。”莫雷尔说，诺瓦蒂埃的表情要比瓦朗蒂娜的身体不舒服更使他更惊慌。他向她奔过去。 瓦朗蒂娜那青年女郎微笑了一下。“放心吧！”她对诺瓦蒂埃说。“别惊慌，马西米兰，没有什么，已经过去了。听！ 我听到前院里有马车的声音。”她打开诺瓦蒂埃的房门，走到走廊的窗口前，又急忙转回来。“是的，”她说，“是腾格拉尔夫人和她的女儿，她们来拜访我们了。告别了！我必须赶快去，因为她们会派人到这儿来找我的，我不要说，再见。陪着爷爷，马西米兰，我答应你，不去留她们。” 莫雷尔目送她离开房间，他听她走上那座通到维尔福夫人的房间和她的房间去的小楼梯。她一走，诺瓦蒂埃便向莫雷尔作了一个要那本字典的表示。莫雷尔遵命，他在瓦朗蒂娜的指导之下，已很快地学会如何懂得那老人的意思。他虽然已经熟练，但因为要背诵字母，要把每一个字从字典里找来，所以花了十分钟才把老人的思想译成这几个字：“把瓦朗蒂娜房间里的那杯水和玻璃瓶拿来给我看一看。” 莫雷尔立刻按铃招呼进那个接替巴罗斯的仆人，按照诺瓦蒂埃的意思作了那个吩咐。仆人不久就回来了。玻璃瓶和玻璃杯都已完全空了。诺瓦蒂埃表示他想说话。“玻璃杯和玻璃瓶怎么会空？”他问，“瓦朗蒂娜说她只喝了一半。”这个新问题的翻译又花了五分钟。 “我不知道，”仆人说，“但婢女在瓦朗蒂娜小姐的房间里。或许是她倒空的。” “去问她。”莫雷尔说，这一次，他从诺瓦蒂埃的眼光读懂了他的思想了。 仆人出去，但几乎马上就回来。“瓦朗蒂娜小姐到维尔福夫人那儿去的时候经过卧房，”他说，“经过的时候，因为口渴，她喝干了那杯糖水。至于玻璃瓶，爱德华先生把它倒给他的鸭子做池塘了。”诺瓦蒂埃抬头望天，象是一个赌徒在孤注一掷时的表情一样。从那时起，老人的眼睛便始终盯住门口，不再移动。 瓦朗蒂娜所接见的的确是腾格拉尔夫人和她的女儿；她们已被领进维尔福夫人的房间里，因为维尔福夫人说要在那儿接见她们。那就是瓦朗蒂娜为什么会经过她房间的缘故。她的房间和她继母的房间同在一排上，中间就隔着爱德华的房间。腾格拉尔夫人母女进入客厅的时候，脸上带着要报告一个正式消息的那种神气。在上流社会中，察颜观色是每一个人的本领，维尔福夫人便也用庄严的神色来接待。这个时候，瓦朗蒂娜进来了，那种庄严的仪式便又扮演了一遍。 “我亲爱的朋友，”当那两位青年姑娘在握手的时候，男爵夫人说，“我带欧热妮来向你宣布一个消息：我的女儿与卡瓦尔康蒂王子的婚期快要到了。” 腾格拉尔保持着“王子”的衔头。那位平民化的银行家觉得这个衔头比“子爵”更顺口。 “允许我先衷心地祝贺你，”维尔福夫人答道。“卡瓦尔康蒂王子阁下看来是一个性情高雅的青年人。” “听着，”男爵夫人微笑着说，“从朋友的立场来讲，我就要说，这位王子在外表上似乎还看不出他的未来。他带有一点外国人的风度，法国人一见就认得出他是意大利或德国贵族。但是，他的本性非常仁厚，资质十分敏慧，腾格拉尔先生曾向我说过，他的财产真是‘壮观’——那可是他的话。” “那末，”欧热妮一面翻看维尔福夫人的纪念册，一面说，“再加一句吧，妈，说你对那个青年人存着很大的希望。” “不用我问，”维尔福夫人说，“你不是也抱有同样的希望吗？” “我！”欧热妮仍以她往常那果断恣肆的口气答道。“噢，丝毫没有，夫人！我的天性不愿意把自己拴在家庭琐事或应付任何一个男子，而希望成为一名艺术家，求得心灵、身体和思想的自由。” 欧热妮说这些话的口气是那样的坚决，以致瓦朗蒂娜的脸红了起来。那个胆怯的姑娘不能了解这种好象不属于女性的强硬的个性。 “但是，”欧热妮继续说，“既然不论是否我愿意都得结婚，我就应该感谢上帝解除了我与阿尔贝先生的婚约，要不是他的干涉，我今天或许是一个声名狼藉的人的妻子了。” “不错，”男爵夫人直率地说，这种率直的口气在平民的谈话中是常见的，在贵妇人之间的谈话中有时也是可以见到的——“一点不错，要不是马尔塞夫犹豫不决，我的女儿就嫁给阿尔贝先生啦。将军自以为很有把握，他甚至来胁迫腾格拉尔先生。我们幸免了一劫。” “但是，”瓦朗蒂娜怯生生地说，“难道父亲的一切耻辱都要转移到儿子身上的吗？在我看来，将军的叛逆罪与阿尔贝先生是完全没有关的呀。” “原谅我，”欧热妮深恶痛绝地说，“阿尔贝先生应该逃脱不了那种羞耻。听说昨天在歌剧院里向基督山先生挑战以后，今天他在决斗场上道歉了。” “不可能的！”维尔福夫人说。 “啊，我亲爱的朋友，”腾格拉尔夫人用象刚才同样直率口气说，“这是事实！我是听德布雷先生说的，今天道歉的时候他也在场。” 瓦朗蒂娜也知道事实的全部真相，但她并不回答。她只记得莫雷尔还在诺瓦蒂埃先生的房间里等候她。由于内心在这样踌躇思索，瓦朗蒂娜暂时没有参加他们谈话。刚才她们所说的话，她实在没有听清楚；突然地，腾格拉尔夫人的手抓住她的臂膀，把她从精神恍惚状态中摇醒过来。 “怎么了？”他说，腾格拉尔夫人的手把她吓了一跳，象是触了电一样。 “我亲爱的瓦朗蒂娜，”男爵夫人说，“你一定病了。” “我？”瓦朗蒂娜姑娘说，一面用手摸一摸她那滚烫的额头。“是的，到对面镜子里去看看你自己吧。你的脸色一阵白一阵红，一分钟要变三四次。” “是的，”欧热妮喊道，“你的脸色非常苍白！” “噢，不用着慌！我这样已经好几天了。” 她虽然不善外交辞令，但也知道这是一个离开的机会；而且，维尔福夫人也来帮她忙了。“休息去吧，瓦朗蒂娜，”她说，“你真的病了，她们会体谅你的。去喝一杯清水，它可以恢复你的精神。” 瓦朗蒂娜吻了一下欧热妮，向腾格拉尔夫人深深鞠了一躬，走出房间；腾格拉尔夫人这时已站起身来告辞。 “那可怜的孩子！”瓦朗蒂娜去后，维尔福夫人说，“她使我非常不安，我恐怕她要生一场大病了。” 这时，瓦朗蒂娜在一种莫名的兴奋中，已走过爱德华的房间和她自己的房间，到达那座小楼梯口。她走下楼梯，当还只有三级楼梯未走完的时候，她已经听到莫雷尔的声音，但突然地，她眼前一阵发黑，她的脚摇摇晃晃地踩不到踏级，她的手无力握住栏杆，她撞到墙上。莫雷尔跑到门口，打开门，发现瓦朗蒂娜躺在地板上。他一把抱起她来，把她放到一张椅子里。瓦朗蒂娜张开了她的眼睛。 “噢，我多笨哪！”她解释说，“我认不得路啦。我忘了还有三级才到地。” “你跌伤了吗？”莫雷尔说，“我能为你做些什么呢，瓦朗蒂娜？” 瓦朗蒂娜向四周环顾了一下；她看到了诺瓦蒂埃眼睛里那种使人害怕的表情。“你放心吧，亲爱的爷爷，”她说，并极力想微笑。“没有什么——没有什么，我只是有点头晕而已。” “又头晕了！”莫雷尔搓着双手说。“噢，要注意呀，瓦朗蒂娜，我求求你。” “不，”瓦朗蒂娜说，——“不，我告诉你那一切都已过去了，没有什么了。现在，让我来告诉你一个好消息吧。欧热妮在一星期内要结婚了，三天之后，就要有一场盛大的宴会，一个订婚宴会。我们都被邀了，我父亲、维尔福夫人和我，——至少我猜想是如此。” “那末，什么时候轮到我们准备我们自己的事情呢？噢，瓦朗蒂娜，你，你的爷爷这样听你话，设法使他回答说‘快了’吧。” “而你，”瓦朗蒂娜说，“要靠我来督促爷爷，唤醒他的记忆吗？” “是的，”莫雷尔喊道，“要快！在你还不完全属于我的时候，瓦朗蒂娜，我老是以为我不久就会失掉你。” “噢！”瓦朗蒂娜带着一个痉挛的动作答道，“噢，真的，马西米兰，你太胆小了，不配做军官，因为，他们说，一个军人是从不知道害怕的呀。哈！哈！哈！” 她爆发出一阵阵痛苦的大笑声；她的手臂僵硬地抽搐；她的头仰在椅背上，接着她就一动不动了。那冻结在诺瓦蒂埃嘴唇上恐怖的喊叫似乎从他的眼睛里发了出来。莫雷尔懂得那种眼光的意思；他知道必须找人来帮助。他猛烈地拉铃，在瓦朗蒂娜小姐房间里的女婢和那个代替巴罗斯的男仆同时奔进来。瓦朗蒂娜那苍白，冷冰冰地缺少生气的脸，使他们不必听什么话，就已感到弥漫在那座房子里的恐怖气氛，于是就飞奔到走廊里去呼救。腾格拉尔夫人和欧热妮那时正在出来，她们听见了慌乱的原因。 “我对你们说过了的！”维尔福夫人喊道。“可怜的孩子！”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/72/4011.html","bookId":545,"book":{"id":545,"title":"The Count of Monte Cristo基督山伯爵","description":"简介：
