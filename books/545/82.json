{"id":43950,"no":82,"title":"Chapter 87 The Challenge","content":"\"THEN,\" continued Beauchamp, \"I took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen. The usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door, and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the Rue de Vaugirard. I left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight. Excuse me, Albert,--sorrow on your account, and delight with that noble girl, thus pursuing paternal vengeance. Yes, Albert, from whatever source the blow may have proceeded--it may be from an enemy, but that enemy is only the agent of providence.\" \\n\\n Albert held his head between his hands; he raised his face, red with shame and bathed in tears, and seizing Beauchamp\u0027s arm, \"My friend,\" said he, \"my life is ended. I cannot calmly say with you, \u0027Providence has struck the blow;\u0027 but I must discover who pursues me with this hatred, and when I have found him I shall kill him, or he will kill me. I rely on your friendship to assist me, Beauchamp, if contempt has not banished it from your heart.\" \\n\\n \"Contempt, my friend? How does this misfortune affect you? No, happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father\u0027s actions. Review your life, Albert; although it is only just beginning, did a lovely summer\u0027s day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career? No, Albert, take my advice. You are young and rich--leave Paris--all is soon forgotten in this great Babylon of excitement and changing tastes. You will return after three or four years with a Russian princess for a bride, and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago.\" \\n\\n \"Thank you, my dear Beauchamp, thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice; but it cannot be. I have told you my wish, or rather my determination. You understand that, interested as I am in this affair, I cannot see it in the same light as you do. What appears to you to emanate from a celestial source, seems to me to proceed from one far less pure. Providence appears to me to have no share in this affair; and happily so, for instead of the invisible, impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments, I shall find one both palpable and visible, on whom I shall revenge myself, I assure you, for all I have suffered during the last month. Now, I repeat, Beauchamp, I wish to return to human and material existence, and if you are still the friend you profess to be, help me to discover the hand that struck the blow.\" \\n\\n \"Be it so,\" said Beauchamp; \"if you must have me descend to earth, I submit; and if you will seek your enemy, I will assist you, and I will engage to find him, my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then, you understand, Beauchamp, that we begin our search immediately. Each moment\u0027s delay is an eternity for me. The calumniator is not yet punished, and he may hope that he will not be; but, on my honor, it he thinks so, he deceives himself.\" \\n\\n \"Well, listen, Morcerf.\" \\n\\n \"Ah, Beauchamp, I see you know something already; you will restore me to life.\" \\n\\n \"I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you, but it is, at least, a ray of light in a dark night; by following it we may, perhaps, discover something more certain.\" \\n\\n \"Tell me; satisfy my impatience.\" \\n\\n \"Well, I will tell you what I did not like to mention on my return from Yanina.\" \\n\\n \"Say on.\" \\n\\n \"I went, of course, to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries. At the first word, before I had even mentioned your father\u0027s name\"-- \\n\\n \"\u0027Ah,\u0027 said he. \u0027I guess what brings you here.\u0027 \\n\\n \"\u0027How, and why?\u0027 \\n\\n \"\u0027Because a fortnight since I was questioned on the same subject.\u0027 \\n\\n \"\u0027By whom?\u0027--\u0027By a Paris banker, my correspondent.\u0027 \\n\\n \"\u0027Whose name is\u0027-- \\n\\n \"\u0027Danglars.\u0027\" \\n\\n \"He!\" cried Albert; \"yes, it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred. He, the man who would be popular, cannot forgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a peer; and this marriage broken off without a reason being assigned--yes, it is all from the same cause.\" \\n\\n \"Make inquiries, Albert, but do not be angry without reason; make inquiries, and if it be true\"-- \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, if it be true,\" cried the young man, \"he shall pay me all I have suffered.\" \\n\\n \"Beware, Morcerf, he is already an old man.\" \\n\\n \"I will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family; if my father had offended him, why did he not attack him personally? Oh, no, he was afraid to encounter him face to face.\" \\n\\n \"I do not condemn you, Albert; I only restrain you. Act prudently.\" \\n\\n \"Oh, do not fear; besides, you will accompany me. Beauchamp, solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness. Before this day closes, if M. Danglars is guilty, he shall cease to live, or I shall die. Pardieu! Beauchamp, mine shall be a splendid funeral!\" \\n\\n \"When such resolutions are made, Albert, they should be promptly executed. Do you wish to go to M. Danglars? Let us go immediately.\" They sent for a cabriolet. On entering the banker\u0027s mansion, they perceived the phaeton and servant of M. Andrea Cavalcanti. \"Ah, parbleu, that\u0027s good,\" said Albert, with a gloomy tone. \"If M. Danglars will not fight with me, I will kill his son-in-law; Cavalcanti will certainly fight.\" The servant announced the young man; but the banker, recollecting what had transpired the day before, did not wish him admitted. It was, however, too late; Albert had followed the footman, and, hearing the order given, forced the door open, and followed by Beauchamp found himself in the banker\u0027s study. \"Sir,\" cried the latter, \"am I no longer at liberty to receive whom I choose in my house? You appear to forget yourself sadly.\" \\n\\n \"No, sir,\" said Albert, coldly; \"there are circumstances in which one cannot, except through cowardice,--I offer you that refuge,--refuse to admit certain persons at least.\" \\n\\n \"What is your errand, then, with me, sir?\" \\n\\n \"I mean,\" said Albert, drawing near, and without apparently noticing Cavalcanti, who stood with his back towards the fireplace--\"I mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes; that will be sufficient--where two men having met, one of them will remain on the ground.\" Danglars turned pale; Cavalcanti moved a step forward, and Albert turned towards him. \"And you, too,\" said he, \"come, if you like, monsieur; you have a claim, being almost one of the family, and I will give as many rendezvous of that kind as I can find persons willing to accept them.\" Cavalcanti looked at Danglars with a stupefied air, and the latter, making an effort, arose and stepped between the two young men. Albert\u0027s attack on Andrea had placed him on a different footing, and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed. \\n\\n \"Indeed, sir,\" said he to Albert, \"if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because I have preferred him to you, I shall resign the case to the king\u0027s attorney.\" \\n\\n \"You mistake, sir,\" said Morcerf with a gloomy smile; \"I am not referring in the least to matrimony, and I only addressed myself to M. Cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us. In one respect you are right, for I am ready to quarrel with every one to-day; but you have the first claim, M. Danglars.\" \\n\\n \"Sir,\" replied Danglars, pale with anger and fear, \"I warn you, when I have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog, I kill it; and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime, I believe I do society a kindness. Now, if you are mad and try to bite me, I will kill you without pity. Is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, miserable wretch!\" cried Morcerf, \"it is your fault.\" Danglars retreated a few steps. \"My fault?\" said he; \"you must be mad! What do I know of the Grecian affair? Have I travelled in that country? Did I advise your father to sell the castle of Yanina--to betray\"-- \\n\\n \"Silence!\" said Albert, with a thundering voice. \"No; it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us, but you hypocritically provoked it.\" \\n\\n \"I?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; you! How came it known?\" \\n\\n \"I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina?\" \\n\\n \"Who wrote to Yanina?\" \\n\\n \"To Yanina?\" \\n\\n \"Yes. Who wrote for particulars concerning my father?\" \\n\\n \"I imagine any one may write to Yanina.\" \\n\\n \"But one person only wrote!\" \\n\\n \"One only?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; and that was you!\" \\n\\n \"I, doubtless, wrote. It appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man, it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family; it is not only a right, but a duty.\" \\n\\n \"You wrote, sir, knowing what answer you would receive.\" \\n\\n \"I, indeed? I assure you,\" cried Danglars, with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man, \"I solemnly declare to you, that I should never have thought of writing to Yanina, did I know anything of Ali Pasha\u0027s misfortunes.\" \\n\\n \"Who, then, urged you to write? Tell me.\" \\n\\n \"Pardieu! it was the most simple thing in the world. I was speaking of your father\u0027s past history. I said the origin of his fortune remained obscure. The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property? I answered, \u0027In Greece.\u0027--\u0027Then,\u0027 said he, \u0027write to Yanina.\u0027\" \\n\\n \"And who thus advised you?\" \\n\\n \"No other than your friend, Monte Cristo.\" \\n\\n \"The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; and I wrote, and will show you my correspondence, if you like.\" Albert and Beauchamp looked at each other. \"Sir,\" said Beauchamp, who had not yet spoken, \"you appear to accuse the count, who is absent from Paris at this moment, and cannot justify himself.\" \\n\\n \"I accuse no one, sir,\" said Danglars; \"I relate, and I will repeat before the count what I have said to you.\" \\n\\n \"Does the count know what answer you received?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; I showed it to him.\" \\n\\n \"Did he know my father\u0027s Christian name was Fernand, and his family name Mondego?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, I had told him that long since, and I did only what any other would have done in my circumstances, and perhaps less. When, the day after the arrival of this answer, your father came by the advice of Monte Cristo to ask my daughter\u0027s hand for you, I decidedly refused him, but without any explanation or exposure. In short, why should I have any more to do with the affair? How did the honor or disgrace of M. de Morcerf affect me? It neither increased nor decreased my income.\" \\n\\n Albert felt the blood mounting to his brow; there was no doubt upon the subject. Danglars defended himself with the baseness, but at the same time with the assurance, of a man who speaks the truth, at least in part, if not wholly--not for conscience\u0027 sake, but through fear. Besides, what was Morcerf seeking? It was not whether Danglars or Monte Cristo was more or less guilty; it was a man who would answer for the offence, whether trifling or serious; it was a man who would fight, and it was evident Danglars\u0027s would not fight. And, in addition to this, everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection. Monte Cristo knew everything, as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Yanina. The answer known, he had yielded to Albert\u0027s wish to be introduced to Haidée, and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali, and had not opposed Haidée\u0027s recital (but having, doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few Romaic words he spoke to her, not to implicate Morcerf\u0027s father). Besides, had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father\u0027s name before Haidée? Lastly, he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near. There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged; Monte Cristo then was in league with his father\u0027s enemies. Albert took Beauchamp aside, and communicated these ideas to him. \\n\\n “这时，”波尚继续说，“我趁着沉静和黑暗离开会议厅，因此没人看见我。那个放我进来的听差在房门口等我，他领我穿过走廊，到达一个通凡琪拉路的暗门。我是带着一种悲喜交加的情绪离开的。原谅我，阿尔贝，悲是为了你，喜是喜那个高贵的姑娘竟能这样为她的父母复仇。是的，阿尔贝，不论那次揭发的消息出自谁的手，是从哪儿来的，我要说：虽然它是从一个敌人那儿来的，但那个敌人一定是充当了上帝的使者。” \\n\\n 阿尔贝用两手抱着他的头，他抬起他那羞得通红的、流满泪水的脸，一直抓住波尚的手臂。“我的朋友，”他说，“我的生命结束了。我不能心平气和地对你说，‘这是上帝的报应’，我必须去找出是谁在用这种手段迫害我，而当我找到他的时候，不是他杀死我，或是我杀死他。我要依赖你的友谊来帮助我来完成这件事，波尚，假如你对我的蔑视还不曾驱走我们之间友谊的话。” \\n\\n “蔑视，我的朋友！这件不幸的事情与你有什么关系呢？不，幸亏儿子要为父亲的行为负责充满公正的偏见时代已经过去了。回顾一下你的生活，阿尔贝，你的生活还仅仅只是开始，每一个黎明都都会给你的生涯带来更纯洁的希望。不，阿尔贝，接受我的忠告吧。你又年轻而又富有，离开法国吧。在这寻求刺激和时时改变口味的伟大的巴比伦，一切不久就会被忘记的。你在三四年以后娶一位俄国公主当作新娘带回来，谁都不会把昨天所发生的事情看作比十六年前所发生的事情更严重了。” \\n\\n “谢谢你，我亲爱的波尚，谢谢你那想使我放弃这种念头的好意，但我是不能这样做的。我已经把我的打算告诉你了，假如有可能的话，好，也可以说那就是我的决心。你知道，以我跟这件事情的关系而论，我不能采取与你一样的态度。在你看来纯粹是天意的事情，在我看来却远没有那样简单。我觉得上帝跟这件事情毫无关系。也幸亏是这样，因为只有这样，我这一个月来所忍受的痛苦，才能不以那摸不到看不见的惩恶天使为对象，而可以向一个既摸得到又看得见的人去寻求报复。现在，我再说一遍，波尚，我愿意回到人和物质的世界，而假如你还象你说的我们还是朋友的话，就帮助我来找出那只击出拳的手吧！ \\n\\n “这样也好，”波尚说，“假如你一定要拉我回到现实，我就屈服了，假如你一定要查出你的敌人，我就来帮助你，这件事情对我的名誉几乎也一样有同样相连的关系。” \\n\\n “嗯，那好，你知道，波尚，我们立刻开始搜索吧。每一瞬间的拖迟在我来说都象很长的时间。那个诽谤者到现在还没有受到任何惩罚，他或许希望他可以不受惩罚。但是，以我的名誉提保，假如他那样想的话，他就在欺骗他自己了。” \\n\\n “好吧，听我说，马尔塞夫。” \\n\\n “啊，波尚，我看你已经明白这一点了，你恢复了我的生命。” \\n\\n “我并没有说事情真是那样，但它至少是黑夜中的一道光芒，沿着这道光芒，我们或许可以达到我们的目的。” \\n\\n “告诉我吧，我都等得不耐烦了。” \\n\\n “嗯，我把我从亚尼纳回来的时候设想对您说的那件事告诉你。” \\n\\n “说吧。” \\n\\n “我到了那里，当然先到当地的大银行家那儿去调查。一开始，甚至我还没有提及你父亲的名字，他就说：‘啊，我猜道你为什么来的了。’‘怎么猜到的呢？’‘因为两星期以前，也有人来问我这同样的问题。’‘谁？’‘巴黎的一个银行家，我的业务伙伴。’他的名字是——’‘腾格拉尔。’” \\n\\n “他！”阿尔贝喊道，“是的，他的确早就对我的父亲嫉恨得不得了。他常以平民自居，不甘心看到马尔塞夫伯爵被任为贵族院的议员，而这次婚姻又是毫无理由破裂的，——对了，一切都是为了那个理由。” \\n\\n “去调查一下，阿尔贝，但不要无缘无故地发火。调查一下，假如是真的话——” \\n\\n “噢，是的，假如是真的，”那青年人喊道，“他就要偿还我所忍受的一切痛苦。” \\n\\n “要小心，马尔塞夫，他已经是一个老年人了。” \\n\\n “我尊敬他的年龄就象他尊敬我的家庭一样。假如他恨我的父亲，他为什么不打死我父亲呢？噢，他是怕跟一个人当面作对的。” \\n\\n “我并不是在责备你，阿尔贝，我只是要跟你说不要感情用事，要慎重一些。” \\n\\n “噢，不用怕，而且，你要陪我去的，波尚。严肃的事情应该当着证人来做的。今天，假如腾格拉尔先生是有罪的，不是他死，就是我死。嘿！波尚，我将以一次庄严的葬礼来维护我的名誉。” \\n\\n “既然你已下了这样的决心，阿尔贝，那就应该立刻去执行。你想立即到腾格拉尔先生那儿去吗？我们走吧。” \\n\\n 他们派人去叫一辆轻便马车。一进那家银行家的院子，他们便看到安德烈·卡瓦尔康蒂的四轮马车和他的仆人在门口。 \\n\\n “啊，太好了！很好，”阿尔贝用一种阴郁的口吻说。“假如腾格拉尔先生不和我决斗，我就杀死他的女婿，他应该是愿意决斗的，——一个卡瓦尔康蒂！” \\n\\n 仆人通知说阿尔贝来访，但那位银行家想起昨天的事情，吩咐仆人关门。可惜已经太迟了，阿尔贝跟着那听差进来了，听到他这样吩咐仆人，便硬推开门，径自闯入那位银行家的书房里，波尚跟在他的后面。 \\n\\n “阁下，”那银行家喊道，“难道我没有权力在我的家里拒绝不想接见的人了吗？你看来是忘乎所以了。” \\n\\n “不，阁下，”阿尔贝冷冷地说，“在这种状况下，如果不是由于懦怯，——这是我给你的托词，——一个人就不能拒绝接见某些人。” \\n\\n “那末，你对我有什么要求呢，阁下？” \\n\\n “我要求，”阿尔贝一面说，一面走近他，似乎并未注意到那背着壁炉站着的卡瓦尔康蒂，——“我要求让我们在一个没有人来打扰的地方交谈十分钟，我对你只有这一点要求，仇人相遇，必定是一死一生。” \\n\\n 腾格拉尔的脸色变得苍白了，卡瓦尔康蒂向前动了一步，阿尔贝就转向他。“还有你，”他说，“假如你高兴的话，你也来吧，子爵阁下，你也有资格这样，因为你几乎已经是这个家庭的一份子了，只要有人愿意接受这种约会，多约几个也无妨。” \\n\\n 卡瓦尔康蒂带着一种愕然的神情望着腾格拉尔，腾格拉尔竭力振作了一下，站起来走到那两个青年人的中间。阿尔贝对安德烈的攻击使他有了一种不同的立场，他希望这次拜访别有缘故，不是他最初所假定的那个原因。 \\n\\n “老实说，阁下，”他对阿尔贝说，“假如你因为我喜欢而陪你，所以到这儿来找这位先生吵架，我就要把这件事情交给检察官去处理。” \\n\\n “你弄错了，阁下，”马尔塞夫带着一个阴郁的微笑说，“这与婚事毫无关系，我所以要对卡瓦尔康蒂先生那样说，是因为他刚才似乎要来干涉我们的企图。在一方面，你说对了，我今天准备要跟每一个人吵架，但你有优先权，腾格拉尔先生。” \\n\\n “阁下，”腾格拉尔回答，愤怒和恐惧使他的脸色变得非常苍白，“我警告你，当我遇到一只疯狗的时候，我会杀了它，但我决不认为自己犯了罪，而是认为我为社会做了一件好事。假如你发了疯，要来咬我，我就要毫不留情地杀死你。难道你父亲的受辱是我的过错？” \\n\\n “是的，你这坏蛋！”马尔塞夫喊道，“是你的过错。” \\n\\n 腾格拉尔后退了一步。“我的错！”他说，“你一定疯了！我怎么知道希腊的历史？我到那些国家去旅行了吗？是我劝告你的父亲出卖亚尼纳堡，背叛——” \\n\\n “住口！”阿尔贝用一种窒息的声音说。“不，你并没有直接揭露这件事情，并没有直接来伤害我们，但这件事情是你暗中唆使的。” \\n\\n “我？” \\n\\n “是的，你！那则消息是从哪儿来的？” \\n\\n “咦，我想报纸已经告诉你了，当然是从亚尼纳来的！” \\n\\n “谁写信到亚尼纳去的？” \\n\\n “写信到亚尼纳？” \\n\\n “是的。是谁写信去打听关于我父亲的消息的？” \\n\\n “我想谁都可以写信到亚尼纳去的吧。” \\n\\n “但只有一个人写了那封信！” \\n\\n “只有一个人？” \\n\\n “是的，而那个人就是你！” \\n\\n “我当然要写。没错，我觉得，当自己的女儿快要嫁给一个青年人的时候，应该去打听一下他的家庭。这不但是一种权利，而且是我的一种责任。” \\n\\n “你写那封信的时候，阁下，是已经知道你会得到什么回答的。” \\n\\n “我！真的，我可以保证，”腾格拉尔用一种信任而且放心的神情喊道，这也许并不完全是吓出来的，而多半是因为他对那个可怜的青年真正感到了关切，“我庄严地向你保证，我本来决想不到要写信到亚尼纳去。我怎知道阿里总督的遭难呢，——我知道吗？” \\n\\n “那肯定是有人煽动你写的了？” \\n\\n “是的” \\n\\n “那个人是谁？说说呀” \\n\\n “啊！这事很简单。我谈到你父亲的过去。我说，他的财产由来还不大清楚。那个人就问我，你父亲的财产是哪儿弄来的？我回答说：在希腊呗。他就对我说：‘好呀！写信到亚尼纳去就是了。’” \\n\\n “劝你的那个人是谁？” \\n\\n “不是别人，就是你的朋友基督山伯爵。” \\n\\n “基督山伯爵叫你写信到亚尼纳去的？” \\n\\n “是的，于是我就写了，假如你高兴的话我可以把回信给你看。” \\n\\n 阿尔贝和波尚对望了一眼。“阁下，”波尚说，“你似乎在指责伯爵，而你知道伯爵此刻不在巴黎，无法为他自己辩护。” \\n\\n “我没有指责任何人，阁下，”腾格拉尔说，“我只是实话实说，即使在伯爵面前。” \\n\\n “伯爵知道回信的内容吗？ \\n\\n “知道，我给他看过回信。” \\n\\n “他知道我父亲的教名叫弗尔南多，姓蒙台哥吗？” \\n\\n “知道，我早就告诉他了。除此以外，我所做的每件事情，任何人处于我的处境，都会这么做的，甚至比我做得更多一些。在我收到回信的第二天，你父亲在基督山的怂勇下，正式来为你提亲，我坚决地拒绝了他，没有作任何解释。我没有必要去揭他的老底，马尔塞夫先生露脸还是丢脸，管我什么事？我既不会因此多赚些钱，也不会因此少赚些。” \\n\\n 阿尔贝觉得自己连额头都涨红了，没有什么可怀疑的了。 \\n\\n 腾格拉尔卑鄙地为自己辩解，但说话的神气却不象在为自己辩解，好象他说的每句话都是千真万确的，当然他的吐露真情并不是由于良心发现而多半是由于害怕的缘故。但马尔塞夫不是要证实腾格拉尔和基督山谁的罪大；而是要寻求一个肯答复侮辱的人，一个肯和自己决斗的人，而腾格拉尔显然是不肯决斗的。这时那些被遗忘或当初并未留意的事情都在他的记忆中呈现出来了。基督山既然买了阿里总督的女儿，当然知道一切；知道了一切，他才劝腾格拉尔写信到亚尼纳去，完全是有预谋的。他知道了回信的内容，所以顺从阿尔贝的愿望，介绍他会见海黛，又有意使谈话转移到阿里之死，不去反对海黛讲述这个故事（但当他用罗马语对那个青年女郎说话的时候，无疑地曾警告了她，叫她不要指明马尔塞夫的父亲）。而且，他不是还要求马尔塞夫不要在海黛的面前提及他父亲的名字吗？最后，当他得知决定性的打击就要到临的时候，他就带阿尔贝去了诺曼底。这一切无疑都经过精心安排好的。，那么基督山也是他父亲的敌人之一了。阿尔贝把波尚拉到一边，把这些想法告诉了他。 \\n\\n “你说得有理，”，波尚说，“腾格拉尔先生在这件事情上只是做得鲁莽俗气一些，而这位基督山先生，你倒是应该要求他解释清楚。” \\n\\n 阿尔贝转过身来。“阁下，”他对腾格拉尔说，“我得证实你的推诿是否成立，我现在就去问基督山伯爵。”他向那位银行家鞠了一躬，和波尚一同向外走，丝毫不在意卡瓦尔康蒂。 \\n\\n 腾格拉尔一直陪他到门口，他在门口又向阿尔贝申明他对马尔塞夫伯爵并无个人恩怨，并不想去得罪他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/72/4005.html","bookId":545,"book":{"id":545,"title":"The Count of Monte
