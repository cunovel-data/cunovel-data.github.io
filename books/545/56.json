{"id":43924,"no":56,"title":"Chapter 60 The Telegraph","content":"M. AND MADAME de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte Cristo, who had come to visit them in their absence, had been ushered into the drawing-room, and was still awaiting them there. Madame de Villefort, who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately, retired to her bedroom, while the procureur, who could better depend upon himself, proceeded at once to the salon. Although M. de Villefort flattered himself that, to all outward view, he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind, he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow, so much so that the count, whose smile was radiant, immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air. \"Ma foi,\" said Monte Cristo, after the first compliments were over, \"what is the matter with you, M. de Villefort? Have I arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime?\" Villefort tried to smile. \"No, count,\" he replied, \"I am the only victim in this case. It is I who lose my cause, and it is ill-luck, obstinacy, and folly which have caused it to be decided against me.\" \\n\\n \"To what do you refer?\" said Monte Cristo with well-feigned interest. \"Have you really met with some great misfortune?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, no, monsieur,\" said Villefort with a bitter smile; \"it is only a loss of money which I have sustained--nothing worth mentioning, I assure you.\" \\n\\n \"True,\" said Monte Cristo, \"the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess, and to one of your philosophic spirit.\" \\n\\n \"It is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me,\" said Villefort, \"though, after all, 900,000 francs are worth regretting; but I am the more annoyed with this fate, chance, or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune, and may blast the prospects of my child also, as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood.\" \\n\\n \"What do you say?\" said the count; \"900,000 francs? It is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher. And who is the cause of all this annoyance?\" \\n\\n \"My father, as I told you.\" \\n\\n \"M. Noirtier? But I thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed, and that all his faculties were completely destroyed?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, his bodily faculties, for he can neither move nor speak, nevertheless he thinks, acts, and wills in the manner I have described. I left him about five minutes ago, and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries.\" \\n\\n \"But to do this he must have spoken?\" \\n\\n \"He has done better than that--he has made himself understood.\" \\n\\n \"How was such a thing possible?\" \\n\\n \"By the help of his eyes, which are still full of life, and, as you perceive, possess the power of inflicting mortal injury.\" \\n\\n \"My dear,\" said Madame de Villefort, who had just entered the room, \"perhaps you exaggerate the evil.\" \\n\\n \"Good-morning, madame,\" said the count, bowing. Madame de Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles. \"What is this that M. de Villefort has been telling me?\" demanded Monte Cristo \"and what incomprehensible misfortune\"-- \\n\\n \"Incomprehensible is not the word,\" interrupted the procureur, shrugging his shoulders. \"It is an old man\u0027s caprice.\" \\n\\n \"And is there no means of making him revoke his decision?\" \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Madame de Villefort; \"and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will, which is now in prejudice of Valentine, to be altered in her favor.\" The count, who perceived that M. and Madame de Villefort were beginning to speak in parables, appeared to pay no attention to the conversation, and feigned to be busily engaged in watching Edward, who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird\u0027s water-glass. \"My dear,\" said Villefort, in answer to his wife, \"you know I have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family, nor have I ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod. Nevertheless, it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family, and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which I have entertained for so many years. The Baron d\u0027Epinay was my friend, as you know, and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged.\" \\n\\n \"Do you think,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"that Valentine is in league with him? She has always been opposed to this marriage, and I should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them.\" \\n\\n \"Madame,\" said Villefort, \"believe me, a fortune of 900,000 francs is not so easily renounced.\" \\n\\n \"She could, nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir, since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent.\" \\n\\n \"Never mind,\" replied Villefort; \"I say that this marriage shall be consummated.\" \\n\\n \"Notwithstanding your father\u0027s wishes to the contrary?\" said Madame de Villefort, selecting a new point of attack. \"That is a serious thing.\" Monte Cristo, who pretended not to be listening, heard however, every word that was said. \"Madame,\" replied Villefort \"I can truly say that I have always entertained a high respect for my father, because, to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority. The name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey. But, under the present circumstances, I am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who, because he hated the father, vents his anger on the son. It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices. I shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward M. Noirtier; I will suffer, without complaint, the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me; but I shall remain firm in my determination, and the world shall see which party his reason on his side. Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz d\u0027Epinay, because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make, and, in short, because I choose to bestow my daughter\u0027s hand on whomever I please.\" \\n\\n \"What?\" said the count, the approbation of whose eye Villefort had frequently solicited during this speech. \"What? Do you say that M. Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry M. le Baron Franz d\u0027Epinay?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, sir, that is the reason,\" said Villefort, shrugging his shoulders. \\n\\n \"The apparent reason, at least,\" said Madame de Villefort. \\n\\n \"The real reason, madame, I can assure you; I know my father.\" \\n\\n \"But I want to know in what way M. d\u0027Epinay can have displeased your father more than any other person?\" \\n\\n \"I believe I know M. Franz d\u0027Epinay,\" said the count; \"is he not the son of General de Quesnel, who was created Baron d\u0027Epinay by Charles X.?\" \\n\\n \"The same,\" said Villefort. \\n\\n \"Well, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.\" \\n\\n \"He is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M. Noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in their affection,\" said Madame de Villefort. \\n\\n \"But,\" said Monte Cristo \"do you not know any cause for this hatred?\" \\n\\n \"Ah, ma foi! who is to know?\" \\n\\n \"Perhaps it is some political difference?\" \\n\\n \"My father and the Baron d\u0027Epinay lived in the stormy times of which I only saw the ending,\" said Villefort. \\n\\n \"Was not your father a Bonapartist?\" asked Monte Cristo; \"I think I remember that you told me something of that kind.\" \\n\\n \"My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else,\" said Villefort, carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; \"and the senator\u0027s robe, which Napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him. When my father conspired, it was not for the emperor, it was against the Bourbons; for M. Noirtier possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any Utopian schemes which could never be realized, but strove for possibilities, and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of The Mountain,--theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result.\" \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Monte Cristo, \"it is just as I thought; it was politics which brought Noirtier and M. d\u0027Epinay into personal contact. Although General d\u0027Epinay served under Napoleon, did he not still retain royalist sentiments? And was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor?\" Villefort looked at the count almost with terror. \"Am I mistaken, then?\" said Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"No, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,\" said Madame de Villefort; \"and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M. de Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies.\" \\n\\n \"It was a sublime and charitable thought,\" said Monte Cristo, \"and the whole world should applaud it. It would be noble to see Mademoiselle Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz d\u0027Epinay.\" Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered. But the count completely baffled the procureur, and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming. \"Although,\" said Villefort, \"it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose her grandfather\u0027s fortune, I do not think that M. d\u0027Epinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss. He will, perhaps, hold me in greater esteem than the money itself, seeing that I sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him. Besides, he knows that Valentine is rich in right of her mother, and that she will, in all probability, inherit the fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran, her mother\u0027s parents, who both love her tenderly.\" \\n\\n \"And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,\" said Madame de Villefort; \"besides, they are to come to Paris in about a month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with M. Noirtier.\" The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love and defeated ambition. \"But it seems to me,\" said Monte Cristo, \"and I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am about to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested, he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear Edward.\" \\n\\n \"True,\" said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe; \"is it not unjust--shamefully unjust? Poor Edward is as much M. Noirtier\u0027s grandchild as Valentine, and yet, if she had not been going to marry M. Franz, M. Noirtier would have left her all his money; and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather, she will still be three times richer than he.\" The count listened and said no more. \"Count,\" said Villefort, \"we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes. It is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions, and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so, but I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and feeling. M. d\u0027Epinay, to whom I had promised the interest of this sum, shall receive it, even if I endure the most cruel privations.\" \\n\\n \"However,\" said Madame de Villefort, returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind, \"perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to M. d\u0027Epinay, in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de Villefort.\" \\n\\n \"Ah, that would be a great pity,\" said Villefort. \\n\\n \"A great pity,\" said Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"Undoubtedly,\" said Villefort, moderating the tones of his voice, \"a marriage once concerted and then broken off, throws a sort of discredit on a young lady; then again, the old reports, which I was so anxious to put an end to, will instantly gain ground. No, it will all go well; M. d\u0027Epinay, if he is an honorable man, will consider himself more than ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort, unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice, but that is impossible.\" \\n\\n \"I agree with M. de Villefort,\" said Monte Cristo, fixing his eyes on Madame de Villefort; \"and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice, I would persuade him, since I have been told M. d\u0027Epinay is coming back, to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation. I will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on M. de Villefort.\" The procureur arose, delighted with the proposition, but his wife slightly changed color. \"Well, that is all that I wanted, and I will be guided by a counsellor such as you are,\" said he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo. \"Therefore let every one here look upon what has passed to-day as if it had not happened, and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans.\" \\n\\n \"Sir,\" said the count, \"the world, unjust as it is, will be pleased with your resolution; your friends will be proud of you, and M. d\u0027Epinay, even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry, which he will not do, would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty.\" At the conclusion of these words, the count rose to depart. \"Are you going to leave us, count?\" said Madame de Villefort. \\n\\n \"I am sorry to say I must do so, madame, I only came to remind you of your promise for Saturday.\" \\n\\n \"Did you fear that we should forget it?\" \\n\\n \"You are very good, madame, but M. de Villefort has so many important and urgent occupations.\" \\n\\n \"My husband has given me his word, sir,\" said Madame de Villefort; \"you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose, and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain.\" \"And,\" said Villefort, \"is it at your house in the Champs-Elysées that you receive your visitors?\" \\n\\n \"No,\" said Monte Cristo, \"which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious,--it is in the country.\" \\n\\n \"In the country?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"Where is it, then? Near Paris, is it not?\" \\n\\n \"Very near, only half a league from the Barriers,--it is at Auteuil.\" \\n\\n \"At Auteuil?\" said Villefort; \"true, Madame de Villefort told me you lived at Auteuil, since it was to your house that she was taken. And in what part of Auteuil do you reside?\" \\n\\n \"Rue de la Fontaine.\" \\n\\n \"Rue de la Fontaine!\" exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone; \"at what number?\" \\n\\n \"No. 28.\" \\n\\n \"Then,\" cried Villefort, \"was it you who bought M. de Saint-Méran\u0027s house!\" \\n\\n \"Did it belong to M. de Saint-Méran?\" demanded Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied Madame de Villefort; \"and, would you believe it, count\"-- \\n\\n \"Believe what?\" \\n\\n \"You think this house pretty, do you not?\" \\n\\n \"I think it charming.\" \\n\\n \"Well, my husband would never live in it.\" \\n\\n \"Indeed?\" returned Monte Cristo, \"that is a prejudice on your part, M. de Villefort, for which I am quite at a loss to account.\" \\n\\n \"I do not like Auteuil, sir,\" said the procureur, making an evident effort to appear calm. \"But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company, sir,\" said Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"No, count,--I hope--I assure you I shall do my best,\" stammered Villefort. \\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Monte Cristo, \"I allow of no excuse. On Saturday, at six o\u0027clock. I shall be expecting you, and if you fail to come, I shall think--for how do I know to the contrary?--that this house, which his remained uninhabited for twenty years, must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it.\" \\n\\n \"I will come, count,--I will be sure to come,\" said Villefort eagerly. \\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Monte Cristo; \"now you must permit me to take my leave of you.\" \\n\\n \"You said before that you were obliged to leave us, monsieur,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject.\" \\n\\n \"Indeed madame,\" said Monte Cristo: \"I scarcely know if I dare tell you where I am going.\" \\n\\n \"Nonsense; say on.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then, it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for hours together.\" \\n\\n \"What is it?\" \\n\\n \"A telegraph. So now I have told my secret.\" \\n\\n \"A telegraph?\" repeated Madame de Villefort. \\n\\n \"Yes, a telegraph. I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every direction, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and I assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it, for I could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message. I began to think of genii, sylphs, gnomes, in short, of all the ministers of the occult sciences, until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination. Now, it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects, with their long black claws, for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals, factions, and government intrigues. But one fine day I learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch, hired for twelve hundred francs a year, and employed all day, not in studying the heavens like an astronomer, or in gazing on the water like an angler, or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him, but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied, black-clawed fellow insect, four or five leagues distant from him. At length I felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely, and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect-actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string.\" \\n\\n \"And are you going there?\" \\n\\n \"I am.\" \\n\\n \"What telegraph do you intend visiting? that of the home department, or of the observatory?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, no; I should find there people who would force me to understand things of which I would prefer to remain ignorant, and who would try to explain to me, in spite of myself, a mystery which even they do not understand. Ma foi, I should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired; it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I had formed of my fellow-creatures. I shall, therefore, not visit either of these telegraphs, but one in the open country where I shall find a good-natured simpleton, who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work.\" \\n\\n \"You are a singular man,\" said Villefort. \\n\\n \"What line would you advise me to study?\" \\n\\n \"The one that is most in use just at this time.\" \\n\\n \"The Spanish one, you mean, I suppose?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you\"-- \\n\\n \"No,\" said Monte Cristo; \"since, as I told you before, I do not wish to comprehend it. The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me; it will he nothing more than a sign from M. Duchatel, or from M. Montalivet, transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne, mystified by two Greek words, tele, graphein. It is the insect with black claws, and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance.\" \\n\\n \"Go then; for in the course of two hours it will be dark, and you will not be able to see anything.\" \\n\\n \"Ma foi! you frighten me. Which is the nearest way? Bayonne?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; the road to Bayonne.\" \\n\\n \"And afterwards the road to Chatillon?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"By the tower of Montlhéry, you mean?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n 维尔福先生夫妇回去后，知道基督山伯爵已在客厅里等候他们了。伯爵来访的时候，他们正在诺瓦蒂埃的房间里，仆人就领他到客厅等候。维尔福夫人很兴奋，不便马上见客，所以就回她的卧室休息去了，检察官比较能自制，所以立刻就到客厅里去了。但不管他抑制感情的功夫多么老练，不管他是如何想竭力控制他脸部的表情，他额头上仍布满了阴云，所以当伯爵笑容可掬地向他迎上来的时候，看到他如此阴沉和若有所思的样子，不禁大吃一惊。 \\n\\n “啊哟！”基督山在一番寒暄过后说道，“您怎么啦，维尔福先生？我来的那个时候，您正在那儿起草极重要的公诉书吗？” \\n\\n 维尔福竭力地装出一个微笑。“不，伯爵阁下，”他答道，“在此案中，我是唯一的牺牲者。我被打败了，而攻击我的是恶运、固执和愚蠢。” \\n\\n “您指的是什么事呀？”基督山以一种装得很巧妙的关切的口吻说道。“您真的遭遇到什么很大的不幸吗？” \\n\\n “噢，伯爵阁下，”维尔福苦笑着说，“我只不过损失了一笔钱而已——不值一提的事。” \\n\\n “不错，”基督山说，“象您这样家境富裕，明智博达的人，损失一点钱是无关痛痒的。” \\n\\n “使我烦恼的倒不全是因为金钱的损失，”维尔福说，“尽管，说起来，九十万法郎倒也是很值得遗憾一下的，但我更恼恨的是这种命运、机遇，或不论你怎样称之为的那种力量，它破坏了我的希望和我的财产，而且也许还会摧毁我孩子的前途，而这一切都是由一个陷入第二次儿童时期的老人所造成的。” \\n\\n “您说什么！”伯爵说，“九十万法郎？这个数目的确是值得令人遗憾的，即使对一位哲学家来说。这件令人不愉快的事是谁造成的？” \\n\\n “家父，我已经跟您谈起过他了。” \\n\\n “诺瓦蒂埃先生！我好象记得您告诉我说，他已经全身瘫痪，已全身都不能动了？” \\n\\n “是的，他的确是已全身不能动，也不能说话，但是，您知道，他还有思想和意志。我刚离开他不到五分钟，他现在正忙着在两位公证人面前立他的遗嘱呢。” \\n\\n “要做到这一点，他不是一定得说话吗？” \\n\\n “他有更好的办法——他可以使人家懂得他的意思。” \\n\\n “那怎么可能呢？” \\n\\n “用他的那双眼睛。您也看得出，那双眼睛还是很有生气的，甚至仍有足以致人死地力量。” \\n\\n “亲爱的，”维尔福夫人这时刚刚走进来，就说，“也许你把灾祸太夸大了吧。” \\n\\n “早上好，夫人！”伯爵鞠躬说道。 \\n\\n 维尔福夫人以最殷勤的微笑接受了他的敬意。 \\n\\n “维尔福先生所说的究竟是怎么回事呀！”基督山问道，“那种不可思议的不幸——” \\n\\n “不可思议这几个字说得太对了！”检查官耸耸肩插进来说，“那纯粹是一个老头子的怪念头。” \\n\\n “难道没有办法能使他取消他的决定吗？” \\n\\n “有的，”维尔福夫人说，“这件事仍完全掌握在我丈夫的手里，那份遗嘱现在对瓦朗蒂娜是不利的，但他有力量可以使其对她有利。” \\n\\n 伯爵觉察到维尔福夫妇已开始在转弯抹角的说话了，就显示出一副对他们的谈话并不注意的样子，假装在看爱德华，而爱德华此时正在恶作剧地把一些墨水倒进鸟的水盂里。 \\n\\n “亲爱的，”维尔福对他妻子说道，“你知道，我一向不习惯在家里玩弄家长特权，我也从不认为天命可以由我点一点头就能决定了的。可是，在我的家里，我的意愿必须受到尊重，我酝酿了这么多年的一个计划，不应该毁在一个老人的愚蠢和一个孩子的怪念头里。你也知道，伊皮奈男爵是我的朋友，我们跟他的儿子联婚是再合适不过的了。” \\n\\n “你说瓦朗蒂娜是不是和他串通的？”维尔福夫人说，“她一直不同意这门亲事。假如我们刚才所见到的那一切只是他们在实现一项早就商量好了的计划，那我一点都不觉得奇怪。” \\n\\n “夫人，”维尔福说，“相信我好了，一笔九十万法郎的财产可不是就这样轻易地被放弃的。” \\n\\n “可她甚至连放弃世界都舍得呀，一年前，她不是自己提出要进修道院的吗？” \\n\\n “不管怎样，”维尔说，“一定要促成这门亲事，我主意已定。” \\n\\n “不顾你父亲的反对吗？”维尔福夫人挑选了一个新的进攻点，说道，“那是后果很严重的事呀！” \\n\\n 基督山假装并没在听他们的谈话，但实际上却字字都听进了耳朵里。 \\n\\n “夫人，”维尔福回答，“说句老实话，我一向很尊重我的父亲，一方面是出于天性，一方面是敬重他高尚的道德。父亲这一名义在两种意义上是神圣的，即他赋予了我们以生命，但同时又是我们应该服从的主人，因此应该受到尊重。但现在，由于他恨那个父亲，竟迁怒到了儿子身上，在这种状况下，我有充分的理由怀疑老人的智力，如果我按照他的怪念头去行事，那就未免太可笑了。我当依旧敬重诺瓦蒂埃先生。他虽使我遭受了金钱上的损失，但我当毫无怨言地忍受，可我一定要坚持我的决定，社会上将来总会明了事非的。所以我要把女儿嫁给弗兰兹·伊皮奈男爵，因为我认为这门亲事对她很合适，总之，是因为我高兴把女儿赐给谁就可以赐给谁。” \\n\\n “什么！”伯爵说道。在讲这番话的过程中，维尔福常常把目光投向他，以求得他的赞许。“什么！您说诺瓦蒂埃先生不立维尔福小姐做他的继承人，就是因为她要嫁给弗兰兹·伊皮奈男爵吗？” \\n\\n “是的，阁下，就是为这个原因。”维尔福耸耸肩说道。 \\n\\n “至少表面上是这个原因。”维尔福夫人说。 \\n\\n “是真正的原因，夫人，我可以向你保证，我了解我父亲的为人。” \\n\\n “这就不可思议了，”那年轻的夫人说。“但我倒很想知道，伊皮奈先生有什么不好，竟会使你父亲讨厌他？” \\n\\n “我想我认识弗兰兹·伊皮奈男爵先生，”伯爵说，“他不是由查理王十世封为伊皮奈男爵的奎斯奈尔将军的儿子吗？” \\n\\n “就是他。”维尔福说道。 \\n\\n “哦，依我看，他倒是一个很可爱的青年呀。” \\n\\n “本来就是嘛，所以我相信诺瓦蒂埃先生只是想找个借口来阻止他孙女儿结婚罢了。老年人对于他们自己所喜爱的事物，总很自私的。” \\n\\n “但是，”基督山说，“您是否知道这种憎恨是从何而来的吗？” \\n\\n “啊，真是！谁知道呢？” \\n\\n “也许那是某种政治上的分歧造成的吧？” \\n\\n “家父和伊皮奈男爵都是大风暴时代的人物，但我对于那个时代只见识了最后几天。”维尔福说道。 \\n\\n “令尊不是一个拿破仑党吗？”基督山问，“我好象记得您这样对我说过。” \\n\\n “家父是个十足的雅各宾派，”维尔福说，他的情绪不自觉地脱离了审慎含蓄的范围。“拿破仑曾在他身上披上了一件上议院议员的长袍，但那只不过改变了他老人家的外表而已，他的内心丝毫没变。当家父蓄谋某个计划的时候，他倒不是在为皇帝着想，而是为了要打击波旁王朝。因为诺瓦蒂埃先生有这么一种特点——他从来不作任何无法实现的乌托邦式的计划，而总是力争其可能性，他依据山岳党那种可怕的原则来使那些可能的事得以实现，山岳党做起事来是从不畏缩的。” \\n\\n “嗯，”基督山说，“我也有同感，诺瓦蒂埃和伊皮奈先生的个人恩怨是出于政治原因。伊皮奈将军虽曾在拿破仑手下干过，但他不是仍保存着保皇党人的思想吗？尽管大家认为他是忠于皇帝的，但他不是有一天晚上在离开拿破仑党分子集会的时候被人暗杀了吗？” \\n\\n “维尔福带着一种近乎恐怖的表情望着伯爵。 \\n\\n “怎么，是我弄错了吗？”基督山问。 \\n\\n “不，阁下，事实正如您所说的，”维尔福夫人说道，“维尔福先生正是为了防止死灰复燃，才想到要用爱的纽带把这两个冤家对头的孩子联合在一起的。” \\n\\n “这真是个崇高仁慈的念头，”基督山说，“全世界的人都应该赞美这种思想。瓦朗蒂娜·维尔福小姐成为弗兰兹·伊皮奈夫人实在是一件可喜的事情。” \\n\\n 维尔福打了一个寒颤。他望着基督山，象是要从他脸上读懂他刚才那番话的真实含意似的。但伯爵完全击败了检察官那种具有穿透力的目光，不让对方在他习惯性的微笑底下发现任何东西。 \\n\\n “瓦朗蒂娜失去了她祖父的遗产，虽然这事严重，”维尔福说，“但我并不认为那桩婚事会因此而受挫。我不相信伊皮奈先生会计较这点金钱上的损失。那笔钱是牺牲了，可我将克守自己的诺言，他将来就会知道，我这个人也许比那笔钱更有价值一些。而且，他知道瓦朗蒂娜有了她母亲留下的那份财产本来已很富有了。她的外祖父母圣·梅朗先生和夫人又很钟爱她，他们的财产将来十拿九稳地也是由她来继承的。” \\n\\n “瓦朗蒂娜这样爱护诺瓦蒂埃先生，其实她的外祖父母倒也应该值得这样爱护，”维尔福夫人说，“他们一个月之内就要到巴黎来了。瓦朗蒂娜在经过了这番羞辱之后，实在犯不上再继续把她自己当半个死人似的和诺瓦蒂埃先生捆在一起了。” \\n\\n 伯爵听了这番自私心受伤和野心失败的话，感到很满意。 \\n\\n “可依我看，”他说——“在讲下面这几句话以前，我必须先请求您的原谅——假如诺瓦蒂埃先生是因为瓦朗蒂娜小姐要嫁给一个他所厌恶的人的儿子而取消了她的继承权的话，那么他不该以同样的理由怪罪那可爱的爱德华吧。” \\n\\n “对呀，”维尔福夫人用一种无法形容的音调说道，“这难道不是很不公正——可耻地不公正吗？可怜的爱德华也象瓦朗蒂娜一样是诺瓦蒂埃先生的孙子，可是假如她不嫁给弗兰兹先生，诺瓦蒂埃先生就会把他的钱全都留给她，再说，尽管爱德华是这一家族传宗接代的人，可是瓦朗蒂娜即使得不到她祖父的遗产，她还是比他富有三倍。” \\n\\n 这一下突击成功了，伯爵听了，没再多说什么。 \\n\\n “伯爵阁下，”维尔福说，“以我们家庭的不幸来这样款待您实在太不应该了。不错，我家的财产要送给慈善机关了，家父要毫无理由地剥夺我的法定继承权。但我依然很满意，因为我知道，我的行为是合情合理的。我以前曾答应过伊皮奈先生可以从这笔钱获取利息，我仍然要兑现这句话，哪怕我因此而把自己弄得穷困到了极点。” \\n\\n “但是，”维尔福夫人又把话头拉回到她脑子里不断转着的一个念头上来了，“我们可以把这不幸的事告诉伊皮奈先生，给他一个机会，让他自动解除他和维尔福小姐的婚约，那也许会更好一些的。” \\n\\n “啊，那样可就太糟了！”维尔福说。 \\n\\n “太糟了！”基督山说。 \\n\\n “当然喽，”维尔福说，语气缓和了下来。“一桩婚事，谈妥以后再破裂，对女方的名誉总是不利的。而且，我本很希望消除先前的那些的谣言，这样一来，它就立刻又会活跃起来的。不，不行。假如伊皮奈先生是一个光明磊落的男人，他想得到维尔福小姐的心只能比以前更坚决——除非他被欲望所左右，但那是不可能的。” \\n\\n “我同意维尔福先生的看法，”基督山目光盯住维尔福夫人说道，“假如交情上讲我有资格给他忠告的话，我会劝他把这件事立刻办妥的，使它绝无反悔的余地，因为我听说伊皮奈先生就要回来了。我敢保证，假如这件事成功了，维尔福先生的名誉一定会大振的。” \\n\\n 检察官站起身来，很高兴听到这个建议，可他的妻子却微微有点变色。“嗯，我正是这样想的，我一定接受象您这样的一位顾问的指导，”他伸手给基督山说道。“所以对于今天所发生的这事我们只当它没有发生过好了。我们的原先的计划不变。” \\n\\n “阁下，”伯爵说道，“这个世界虽不公平，但对您如此意志坚决一定会很高兴的。您的朋友将为您感到骄傲的。而伊皮奈先生，即使维尔福小姐嫁过去的时候一点嫁妆都没有——当然不会是那样的——他也会很高兴的，因为他知道从此进入了一个能不惜牺牲信守诺言的家庭。”说完这几句话，伯爵就站起身来，准备告辞了。 \\n\\n “您要走了吗，伯爵阁下？”维尔福夫人问。 \\n\\n “很抱歉，我必须得走了，夫人，我此来的目的只是为要提醒你们星期六的那个约会。” \\n\\n “您怕我们会忘了是吗？” \\n\\n “您太好了，夫人，可维尔福先生常常有这么多紧急的事要办。” \\n\\n “我丈夫已经答应过了，阁下，”维尔福夫人说。“您知道，凡是他说过的话，即使在百失而无一得的时候，也从不肯失信的。况且现在他是百得而无一失，那当然会更坚守诺言了。” \\n\\n “您是在香榭丽舍大道的府上请客吗？” \\n\\n “不，”基督山说道，“所以您更得赏脸才行，因为是在乡下请客。” \\n\\n “在乡下？” \\n\\n “是的。” \\n\\n “在哪儿？离巴黎很近吗？” \\n\\n “非常近，出城只一哩半路——在欧特伊。” \\n\\n “在欧特伊？”维尔福说道。“不错，夫人曾告诉过我您住在欧特伊，因为她就是在府上的门前得救的。您住在欧特伊的哪个地方？” \\n\\n “芳丹街。” \\n\\n “芳丹街？”维尔福呼吸有点急促地大声说道，“几号门牌？” \\n\\n “二十八号。” \\n\\n “呀！”维尔福大声说道，“那么说，圣·梅朗先生的房子就是您买下的了？” \\n\\n “它原属于圣·梅朗先生吗？”基督山问道。 \\n\\n “是的，”维尔福夫人答道，“您信不信，伯爵阁下——” \\n\\n “信什么？” \\n\\n “您觉得那所房子很迷人，是不是？” \\n\\n “我觉得它很可爱。” \\n\\n “嗯，我丈夫却从不愿意到那里去住。” \\n\\n “真的！”基督山答道，“那就是您的偏见了，阁下，那对我可是不利的。” \\n\\n “我不喜欢欧特伊那个地方，阁下。”检察官竭力控制住他自己说道。 \\n\\n “我希望您的成见不至于影响到我和您聚会吧，阁下。”基督山说道。 \\n\\n “不，伯爵阁下，我希望，我向您保证，我会尽力想法去的。”维尔福结结巴巴地说道。 \\n\\n “噢，”基督山说道，“我不是听任何借口的。星期六，六点钟，我等着您，假如您不来，我就会以为，唉，我怎么能这样想呢？我会认为这座二十年没人住的房子一定曾有过某种阴森可怕的传说。” \\n\\n “我会来的，伯爵阁下，我一定来！”维尔福急忙说道。 \\n\\n “谢谢您，”基督山说道，“现在勿请你们谅解，我要告辞了。” \\n\\n “啊，对了，伯爵阁下，”维尔福夫人说，“您刚才说非走不可，我想，您大概会告诉我们是什么原因吧，只是后来讲到了别的事，才把您的话打断了。” \\n\\n “老实说，夫人，”基督山说道，”我自己也弄不清我究竟敢不敢把我要去的那个地方告诉您。” \\n\\n “哧！告诉我吧，没什么关系的。” \\n\\n “哦，那么，我要去——我本来是一个游手好闲的人——看一件有时候我会对它沉思默想几个钟头的东西。” \\n\\n “是什么东西？” \\n\\n “一所急报站。现在我已经泄露这个秘密啦。” \\n\\n “一所急报站！”维尔福夫人重复道。 \\n\\n “是的，一所急报站！我常常在小丘顶上看到它。在阳光下，它那黑色的手臂伸向四面八方，总使人联想到那是一只甲虫的脚爪。实话告诉你们，我每次注视它的时候，总不免要有很多感触，因为我总在心里想：在急报线的一端，有一个人坐在一张桌子前面，他靠一种万能的意志力，使那些古怪的信号划破长空，把他的意思传达到九百哩外坐在另张桌子前面的人。我幻想着在那由灰色的云或蓝色的天空所衬扎的背景上，可以看得到那些破空前进的怪信号。于是我又联想到天神、地灵、鬼仙——总之，想到了种种玄妙神秘的力量——直到我自己对这种胡思乱想的念头也放声大笑起来。我从不想去对这些有黑色长脚爪的大昆虫作较近的观察，因为我老是害怕会在它那石头翅膀底下碰到一个极其严肃、极其迂阔、脑子里装满了科学、玄奥和魔法，充当守护神的小人。可是有一天，有人对我说，每一所急报站里的工作人员都是一个年俸仅一千二百法郎的可怜虫，他成天地，不象天文学家那种研究天象，也不象渔翁那样凝视水波，甚至连观望四周田野的权利都没有，而只是注视着离他十四五哩远的另一个人。所以我就产生了好奇心，想去仔细看看这种活着的蛹，去观察一下它是怎样从它的茧壳底下扯动这一条丝或那一条丝来和其他的蛹联络。” \\n\\n “所以您要到那儿去一次？” \\n\\n “是的。” \\n\\n “您要去参观哪一个急报站，是内政部的，还是天文台的？” \\n\\n “噢，不！我对这事倒情愿不知道的好，要是到那儿去，就会有人强迫我来了解它，把他们自己都不了解的东西勉强解释给我听。不，真的！我希望完整地保存我那个有关昆虫的幻想。我只要去见一见那些一知半解、跟我自己差不多的人就行了。所以我不去参观内政部或天文台的急报站。我所要找的，是旷野上的一个站房，在那儿我可以找到一个蛰伏在他的窝的老实人。” \\n\\n “您真是一位奇人。”维尔福说道。 \\n\\n “您觉得我去研究哪一条线好呢？” \\n\\n “现在最忙碌的那一条线吧。” \\n\\n “您是指西班牙线吗？” \\n\\n “是的，您要不要弄一封给部长的介绍信，让他们解释给您听？” \\n\\n “不必了，”基督山说道，“因为，我刚才已经告诉过您了，我并不想了解它。一旦我了解了它，我印象中急报这两个字就不复存在了，它将只是一种自甲地到乙地的秘密信号通信法而已，可我却很想保全我对那只黑脚爪大蜘蛛的全部崇敬。” \\n\\n “那么，去吧，因为两小时以内，天就要黑了，您就什么都看不到了。” \\n\\n “糟糕！您说得我着急起来啦！哪一个站房最近？” \\n\\n “到巴荣纳去的那条路上的那个吗？” \\n\\n “是的，是到巴荣纳去的那条路上的那个。” \\n\\n “夏蒂荣的那一站最近。” \\n\\n “再过去夏蒂荣的那一站呢？” \\n\\n “我想就是蒙得雷塔的了。” \\n\\n “谢谢您。再会。星期六我会把我的观察告诉你们的。” \\n\\n 伯爵在门口遇到了那两位公证人，他们刚刚完成那件剥夺瓦朗蒂娜继承权的工作，自以为已经干成了一件一定可以提高他们声望的大事。 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/72/3979.html","bookId":545,"book":{"id":545,"title":"The Count of
