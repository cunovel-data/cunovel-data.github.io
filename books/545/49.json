{"id":43917,"no":49,"title":"Chapter 53 Robert le Diable","content":"THE PRETEXT of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible, as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the Académie Royale. Levasseur, who had been suffering under severe illness, made his reappearance in the character of Bertrand, and, as usual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience. Morcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his orchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance; he had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus box. Chateau-Renaud rented a stall beside his own, while Beauchamp, as a journalist, had unlimited range all over the theatre. It happened that on this particular night the minister\u0027s box was placed at the disposal of Lucien Debray, who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf, who again, upon his mother\u0027s rejection of it, sent it to Danglars, with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening, in the event of their accepting the box in question. The ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal. To no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera-box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire, who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king\u0027s ransom in his waistcoat pocket. \\n\\n Danglars had, however, protested against showing himself in a ministerial box, declaring that his political principles, and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself; the baroness had, therefore, despatched a note to Lucien Debray, bidding him call for them, it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with Eugénie to the opera. There is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort, while the addition of a third, in the person of her mother\u0027s admitted lover, enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to defy malice and ill-nature. One must take the world as one finds it. \\n\\n The curtain rose, as usual, to an almost empty house, it being one of the absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance, so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it, that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals, while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors, and the buzz of conversation. \\n\\n \"Surely,\" said Albert, as the door of a box on the first circle opened, \"that must be the Countess G----.\" \\n\\n \"And who is the Countess G----?\" inquired Chateau-Renaud. \\n\\n \"What a question! Now, do you know, baron, I have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it; as if all the world did not know who the Countess G----was.\" \\n\\n \"Ah, to be sure,\" replied Chateau-Renaud; \"the lovely Venetian, is it not?\" \\n\\n \"Herself.\" At this moment the countess perceived Albert, and returned his salutation with a smile. \"You know her, it seems?\" said Chateau-Renaud. \\n\\n \"Franz introduced me to her at Rome,\" replied Albert. \\n\\n \"Well, then, will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in Rome?\" \\n\\n \"With pleasure.\" \\n\\n There was a cry of \"Shut up!\" from the audience. This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music, produced not the slightest effect on the two young men, who continued their conversation. \"The countess was present at the races in the Champ-de-Mars,\" said Chateau-Renaud. \\n\\n \"To-day?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"Bless me, I quite forgot the races. Did you bet?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, merely a paltry fifty louis.\" \\n\\n \"And who was the winner?\" \\n\\n \"Nautilus. I staked on him.\" \\n\\n \"But there were three races, were there not?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; there was the prize given by the Jockey Club--a gold cup, you know--and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race.\" \\n\\n \"What was it?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, shut up!\" again interposed some of the audience. \\n\\n \"Why, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course.\" \\n\\n \"Is that possible?\" \\n\\n \"True as day. The fact was, nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of Vampa, or that of a jockey styled Job, when, at the last moment, a splendid roan, mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist, presented themselves at the starting-post. They were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider\u0027s pockets, to make him weight; but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare, against whom he ran, by at least three whole lengths.\" \\n\\n \"And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged?\" \\n\\n \"No.\" \\n\\n \"You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa?\" \\n\\n \"Exactly; that was the title.\" \\n\\n \"Then,\" answered Albert, \"I am better informed than you are, and know who the owner of that horse was.\" \\n\\n \"Shut up, there!\" cried the pit in chorus. And this time the tone and manner in which the command was given, betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived, for the first time, that the mandate was addressed to them. Leisurely turning round, they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them, as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the challenge, the friends turned again to the front of the theatre, and affected to busy themselves with the stage. At this moment the door of the minister\u0027s box opened, and Madame Danglars, accompanied by her daughter, entered, escorted by Lucien Debray, who assiduously conducted them to their seats. \\n\\n \"Ha, ha,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"here comes some friends of yours, viscount! What are you looking at there? don\u0027t you see they are trying to catch your eye?\" Albert turned round, just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness; as for Mademoiselle Eugénie, she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage. \"I tell you what, my dear fellow,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"I cannot imagine what objection you can possibly have to Mademoiselle Danglars--that is, setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank, which by the way I don\u0027t think you care very much about. Now, barring all that, I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl!\" \\n\\n \"Handsome, certainly,\" replied Albert, \"but not to my taste, which I confess, inclines to something softer, gentler, and more feminine.\" \\n\\n \"Ah, well,\" exclaimed Chateau-Renaud, who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend, \"you young people are never satisfied; why, what would you have more? your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of Diana, the huntress, and yet you are not content.\" \\n\\n \"No, for that very resemblance affrights me; I should have liked something more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua; but this chase-loving Diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of Act?on.\" \\n\\n And, indeed, it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to comprehend the justness of Morcerf\u0027s remark--she was beautiful, but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste; her hair was raven black, but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious; her eyes, of the same color as her hair, were surmounted by well-arched brows, whose great defect, however, consisted in an almost habitual frown, while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex--her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled Juno. Her mouth, which might have been found fault with as too large, displayed teeth of pearly whiteness, rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips, contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion. But that which completed the almost masculine look Morcerf found so little to his taste, was a dark mole, of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are, placed just at the corner of her mouth; and the effect tended to increase the expression of self-dependence that characterized her countenance. The rest of Mademoiselle Eugénie\u0027s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described; she, indeed, reminded one of Diana, as Chateau-Renaud observed, but her bearing was more haughty and resolute. As regarded her attainments, the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty, that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person. She was a perfect linguist, a first-rate artist, wrote poetry, and composed music; to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted, following it with an indefatigable perseverance, assisted by a schoolfellow,--a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer. It was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day, who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice, which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence. But this counsel effectually decided Mademoiselle Danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life; and acting upon this principle, the banker\u0027s daughter, though perfectly willing to allow Mademoiselle Louise d\u0027Armilly (that was the name of the young virtuosa) to practice with her through the day, took especial care not to be seen in her company. Still, though not actually received at the Hotel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend, Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess. \\n\\n The curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame Danglars into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half-hour\u0027s interval allowed between the acts, and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes. Morcerf and Chateau-Renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission. For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party, and she whispered her expectations to her daughter, that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them. Mademoiselle Eugénie, however, merely returned a dissenting movement of the head, while, with a cold smile, she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle, in which sat the Countess G----, and where Morcerf had just made his appearance. \"So we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?\" cried the countess, extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance; \"it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly, and still more so to bestow your first visit on me.\" \\n\\n \"Be assured,\" replied Albert, \"that if I had been aware of your arrival in Paris, and had known your address, I should have paid my respects to you before this. Allow me to introduce my friend, Baron de Chateau-Renaud, one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France, and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the Champ-de-Mars, yesterday.\" Chateau-Renaud bowed to the countess. \\n\\n \"So you were at the races, baron?\" inquired the countess eagerly. \\n\\n \"Yes, madame.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then,\" pursued Madame G----with considerable animation, \"you can probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes?\" \\n\\n \"I am sorry to say I cannot,\" replied the baron; \"and I was just asking the same question of Albert.\" \\n\\n \"Are you very anxious to know, countess?\" asked Albert. \\n\\n \"To know what?\" \\n\\n \"The name of the owner of the winning horse?\" \\n\\n \"Excessively; only imagine--but do tell me, viscount, whether you really are acquainted with it or no?\" \\n\\n \"I beg your pardon, madame, but you were about to relate some story, were you not? You said, \u0027only imagine,\u0027--and then paused. Pray continue.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then, listen. You must know I felt so interested in the splendid roan horse, with his elegant little rider, so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap, that I could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake; and when I saw them outstrip all the others, and come to the winning-post in such gallant style, I actually clapped my hands with joy. Imagine my surprise, when, upon returning home, the first object I met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket! I concluded that, by some singular chance, the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself; but, as I entered my apartments, I beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider. Inside the cup was a small piece of paper, on which were written these words--\u0027From Lord Ruthven to Countess G----.\u0027\" \\n\\n \"Precisely; I was sure of it,\" said Morcerf. \\n\\n \"Sure of what?\" \\n\\n \"That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself.\" \\n\\n \"What Lord Ruthven do you mean?\" \\n\\n \"Why, our Lord Ruthven--the Vampire of the Salle Argentino!\" \\n\\n \"Is it possible?\" exclaimed the countess; \"is he here in Paris?\" \\n\\n \"To be sure,--why not?\" \\n\\n \"And you visit him?--meet him at your own house and elsewhere?\" \\n\\n \"I assure you he is my most intimate friend, and M. de Chateau-Renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance.\" \\n\\n \"But why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club prize?\" \\n\\n \"Was not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa?\" \\n\\n \"What of that?\" \\n\\n \"Why, do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I was made prisoner?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, yes.\" \\n\\n \"And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner?\" \\n\\n \"To be sure, I remember it all now.\" \\n\\n \"He called himself Vampa. You see. it\u0027s evident where the count got the name.\" \\n\\n \"But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?\" \\n\\n \"In the first place, because I had spoken much of you to him, as you may believe; and in the second, because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success.\" \\n\\n \"I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him?\" \\n\\n \"I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not. Besides, his presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven\"-- \\n\\n \"Oh, but that is dreadful! Why, the man must owe me a fearful grudge.\" \\n\\n \"Does his action appear like that of an enemy?\" \\n\\n \"No; certainly not.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then\"-- \\n\\n \"And so he is in Paris?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"And what effect does he produce?\" \\n\\n \"Why,\" said Albert, \"he was talked about for a week; then the coronation of the queen of England took place, followed by the theft of Mademoiselle Mars\u0027s diamonds; and so people talked of something else.\" \\n\\n \"My good fellow,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly. Do not believe what Albert is telling you, countess; so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated, I take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever. His first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth 32,000 francs, to Madame Danglars; his second, the almost miraculous preservation of Madame de Villefort\u0027s life; now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club. I therefore maintain, in spite of Morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment, but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which, after all, may be his ordinary mode of existence.\" \\n\\n \"Perhaps you are right,\" said Morcerf; \"meanwhile, who is in the Russian ambassador\u0027s box?\" \\n\\n \"Which box do you mean?\" asked the countess. \\n\\n \"The one between the pillars on the first tier--it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh.\" \\n\\n \"Did you observe any one during the first act?\" asked Chateau-Renaud. \\n\\n \"Where?\" \\n\\n \"In that box.\" \\n\\n \"No,\" replied the countess, \"it was certainly empty during the first act;\" then, resuming the subject of their previous conversation, she said, \"And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte Cristo that gained the prize?\" \\n\\n \"I am sure of it.\" \\n\\n \"And who afterwards sent the cup to me?\" \\n\\n \"Undoubtedly.\" \\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t know him,\" said the countess; \"I have a great mind to return it.\" \\n\\n \"Do no such thing, I beg of you; he would only send you another, formed of a magnificent sapphire, or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby. It is his way, and you must take him as you find him.\" At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act. Albert rose to return to his place. \"Shall I see you again?\" asked the countess. \"At the end of the next act, with your permission, I will come and inquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris?\" \\n\\n \"Pray take notice,\" said the countess, \"that my present residence is 22 Rue de Rivoli, and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday evening. So now, you are both forewarned.\" The young men bowed, and quitted the box. Upon reaching their stalls, they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian ambassador. A man of from thirty-five to forty years of age, dressed in deep black, had just entered, accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern style. The lady was surpassingly beautiful, while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her. \"Hullo,\" said Albert; \"it is Monte Cristo and his Greek!\" \\n\\n The strangers were, indeed, no other than the count and Haidée. In a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house, and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds. The second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices--one deep whisper--intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred; all eyes, all thoughts, were occupied with the young and beautiful woman, whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle. Upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated her desire to see Albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act, and neither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given. At the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness. Having bowed to the two ladies, he extended his hand to Debray. By the baroness he was most graciously welcomed, while Eugénie received him with her accustomed coldness. \\n\\n \"My dear fellow,\" said Debray, \"you have come in the nick of time. There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count; she insists upon it that I can tell her his birth, education, and parentage, where he came from, and whither he is going. Being no disciple of Cagliostro, I was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of getting out of the scrape, I said, \u0027Ask Morcerf; he has got the whole history of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers\u0027 ends;\u0027 whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you.\" \\n\\n \"Is it not almost incredible,\" said Madame Danglars, \"that a person having at least half a million of secret-service money at his command, should possess so little information?\" \\n\\n \"Let me assure you, madame,\" said Lucien, \"that had I really the sum you mention at my disposal, I would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte Cristo, whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob. However, I have turned the business over to Morcerf, so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you; for my own part, I care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings.\" \\n\\n \"I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32,000 francs, wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000 francs each.\" \\n\\n \"He seems to have a mania for diamonds,\" said Morcerf, smiling, \"and I verily believe that, like Potemkin, he keeps his pockets filled, for the sake of strewing them along the road, as Tom Thumb did his flint stones.\" \\n\\n \"Perhaps he has discovered some mine,\" said Madame Danglars. \"I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron\u0027s banking establishment?\" \\n\\n \"I was not aware of it,\" replied Albert, \"but I can readily believe it.\" \\n\\n \"And, further, that he stated to M. Danglars his intention of only staying a year in Paris, during which time he proposed to spend six millions. \\n\\n \"He must be the Shah of Persia, travelling incog.\" \\n\\n \"Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, M. Lucien?\" inquired Eugénie. \\n\\n \"I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself,\" responded Lucien, raising his lorgnette to his eye. \"A most lovely creature, upon my soul!\" was his verdict. \\n\\n \"Who is this young person, M. de Morcerf?\" inquired Eugénie; \"does anybody know?\" \\n\\n \"Mademoiselle,\" said Albert, replying to this direct appeal, \"I can give you very exact information on that subject, as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing--the young woman is a Greek.\" \\n\\n \"So I should suppose by her dress; if you know no more than that, every one here is as well-informed as yourself.\" \\n\\n \"I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone,\" replied Morcerf, \"but I am reluctantly obliged to confess, I have nothing further to communicate--yes, stay, I do know one thing more, namely, that she is a musician, for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting with the count, I heard the sound of a guzla--it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own.\" \\n\\n \"Then your count entertains visitors, does he?\" asked Madame Danglars. \\n\\n \"Indeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, I can assure you.\" \\n\\n \"I must try and persuade M. Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner, or something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in return.\" \\n\\n \"What,\" said Debray, laughing; \"do you really mean you would go to his house?\" \\n\\n \"Why not? my husband could accompany me.\" \\n\\n \"But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?\" \\n\\n \"You have ample proof to the contrary, if you look opposite,\" said the baroness, as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek. \\n\\n \"No, no!\" exclaimed Debray; \"that girl is not his wife: he told us himself she was his slave. Do you not recollect, Morcerf, his telling us so at your breakfast?\" \\n\\n \"Well, then,\" said the baroness, \"if slave she be, she has all the air and manner of a princess.\" \\n\\n \"Of the Arabian Nights?\" \\n\\n \"If you like; but tell me, my dear Lucien, what it is that constitutes a princess. Why, diamonds--and she is covered with them.\" \\n\\n \"To me she seems overloaded,\" observed Eugénie; \"she would look far better if she wore fewer, and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists.\" \\n\\n \"See how the artist peeps out!\" exclaimed Madame Danglars. \"My poor Eugénie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts.\" \\n\\n \"I admire all that is beautiful,\" returned the young lady. \\n\\n \"What do you think of the count?\" inquired Debray; \"he is not much amiss, according to my ideas of good looks.\" \\n\\n \"The count,\" repeated Eugénie, as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner; \"the count?--oh, he is so dreadfully pale.\" \\n\\n \"I quite agree with you,\" said Morcerf; \"and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out. The Countess G----insists upon it that he is a vampire.\" \\n\\n \"Then the Countess G----has returned to Paris, has she?\" inquired the baroness. \\n\\n \"Is that she, mamma?\" asked Eugénie; \"almost opposite to us, with that profusion of beautiful light hair?\" \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Madame Danglars, \"that is she. Shall I tell you what you ought to do, Morcerf?\" \\n\\n \"Command me, madame.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then, you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to us.\" \\n\\n \"What for?\" asked Eugénie. \\n\\n \"What for? Why, to converse with him, of course. Have you really no desire to meet him?\" \\n\\n \"None whatever,\" replied Eugénie. \\n\\n \"Strange child,\" murmured the baroness. \\n\\n \"He will very probably come of his own accord,\" said Morcerf. \"There; do you see, madame, he recognizes you, and bows.\" The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner. \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Morcerf, \"I may as well be magnanimous, and tear myself away to forward your wishes. Adieu; I will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him.\" \\n\\n \"Go straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan.\" \\n\\n \"But I have never been presented.\" \\n\\n \"Presented to whom?\" \\n\\n \"To the beautiful Greek.\" \\n\\n \"You say she is only a slave?\" \\n\\n \"While you assert that she is a queen, or at least a princess. No; I hope that when he sees me leave you, he will come out.\" \\n\\n \"That is possible--go.\" \\n\\n \"I am going,\" said Albert, as he made his parting bow. Just as he was passing the count\u0027s box, the door opened, and Monte Cristo came forth. After giving some directions to Ali, who stood in the lobby, the count took Albert\u0027s arm. Carefully closing the box door, Ali placed himself before it, while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nubian. \\n\\n \"Upon my word,\" said Monte Cristo, \"Paris is a strange city, and the Parisians a very singular people. See that cluster of persons collected around poor Ali, who is as much astonished as themselves; really one might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever beheld. Now I can promise you, that a Frenchman might show himself in public, either in Tunis, Constantinople, Bagdad, or Cairo, without being treated in that way.\" \\n\\n \"That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either. However, as far as Ali is concerned, I can assure you, the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant--you, who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris.\" \\n\\n \"Really? and what has procured me so fluttering a distinction?\" \\n\\n \"What? why, yourself, to be sure! You give away horses worth a thousand louis; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty; under the name of Major Brack you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots; then, when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the first handsome woman you think of!\" \\n\\n \"And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?\" \\n\\n \"Why, in the first place, I heard it from Madame Danglars, who, by the by, is dying to see you in her box, or to have you seen there by others; secondly, I learned it from Beauchamp\u0027s journal; and thirdly, from my own imagination. Why, if you sought concealment, did you call your horse Vampa?\" \\n\\n \"That was an oversight, certainly,\" replied the count; \"but tell me, does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera? I have been looking for him, but without success.\" \\n\\n \"He will be here to-night.\" \\n\\n \"In what part of the house?\" \\n\\n \"In the baroness\u0027s box, I believe.\" \\n\\n \"That charming young woman with her is her daughter?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"I congratulate you.\" Morcerf smiled. \"We will discuss that subject at length some future time,\" said he. \"But what do you think of the music?\" \\n\\n \"What music?\" \\n\\n \"Why, the music you have been listening to.\" \\n\\n \"Oh, it is well enough as the production of a human composer, sung by featherless bipeds, to quote the late Diogenes.\" \\n\\n \"From which it would seem, my dear count, that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise?\" \\n\\n \"You are right, in some degree; when I wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to, I go to sleep.\" \\n\\n \"Then sleep here, my dear count. The conditions are favorable; what else was opera invented for?\" \\n\\n \"No, thank you. Your orchestra is too noisy. To sleep after the manner I speak of, absolute calm and silence are necessary, and then a certain preparation\"-- \\n\\n \"I know--the famous hashish!\" \\n\\n \"Precisely. So, my dear viscount, whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me.\" \\n\\n \"I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you,\" said Morcerf. \\n\\n \"Do you mean at Rome?\" \\n\\n \"I do.\" \\n\\n \"Ah, then, I suppose you heard Haidée\u0027s guzla; the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land.\" Morcerf did not pursue the subject, and Monte Cristo himself fell into a silent reverie. The bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain. \"You will excuse my leaving you,\" said the count, turning in the direction of his box. \\n\\n \"What? Are you going?\" \\n\\n \"Pray, say everything that is kind to Countess G----on the part of her friend the Vampire.\" \\n\\n \"And what message shall I convey to the baroness!\" \\n\\n \"That, with her permission, I shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening.\" \\n\\n The third act had begun; and during its progress the Count of Morcerf, according to his promise, made his appearance in the box of Madame Danglars. The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement; his presence, therefore, was wholly unnoticed, save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself. The quick eye of Monte Cristo however, marked his coming; and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips. Haidée, whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage, like all unsophisticated natures, delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear. \\n\\n The third act passed off as usual. Mesdemoiselles Noblet, Julie, and Leroux executed the customary pirouettes; Robert duly challenged the Prince of Granada; and the royal father of the princess Isabella, taking his daughter by the hand, swept round the stage with majestic strides, the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle. After which the curtain again fell, and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon. The count left his box, and a moment later was saluting the Baronne Danglars, who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise. \"You are welcome, count!\" she exclaimed, as he entered. \"I have been most anxious to see you, that I might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express.\" \\n\\n \"Surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your remembrance. Believe me, madame, I had entirely forgotten it.\" \\n\\n \"But it is not so easy to forget, monsieur, that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend, Madame de Villefort, which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me.\" \\n\\n \"This time, at least, I do not deserve your thanks. It was Ali, my Nubian slave, who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort.\" \\n\\n \"Was it Ali,\" asked the Count of Morcerf, \"who rescued my son from the hands of bandits?\" \\n\\n \"No, count,\" replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general; \"in this instance I may fairly and freely accept your thanks; but you have already tendered them, and fully discharged your debt--if indeed there existed one--and I feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject. May I beg of you, baroness, to honor me with an introduction to your daughter?\" \"Oh, you are no stranger--at least not by name,\" replied Madame Danglars, \"and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you. Eugénie,\" continued the baroness, turning towards her daughter, \"this is the Count of Monte Cristo.\" The Count bowed, while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly. \"You have a charming young person with you to-night, count,\" said Eugénie. \"Is she your daughter?\" \\n\\n \"No, mademoiselle,\" said Monte Cristo, astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question. \"She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my care.\" \\n\\n \"And what is her name?\" \\n\\n \"Haidée,\" replied Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"A Greek?\" murmured the Count of Morcerf. \\n\\n \"Yes, indeed, count,\" said Madame Danglars; \"and tell me, did you ever see at the court of Ali Tepelini, whom you so gloriously and valiantly served, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?\" \\n\\n \"Did I hear rightly, monsieur,\" said Monte Cristo \"that you served at Yanina?\" \\n\\n \"I was inspector-general of the pasha\u0027s troops,\" replied Morcerf; \"and it is no secret that I owe my fortune, such as it is, to the liberality of the illustrious Albanese chief.\" \\n\\n \"But look!\" exclaimed Madame Danglars. \\n\\n \"Where?\" stammered Morcerf. \\n\\n \"There,\" said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count, and leaning with him over the front of the box, just as Haidée, whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian, perceived his pale features close to Morcerf\u0027s face. It was as if the young girl beheld the head of Medusa. She bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw, then, uttering a faint cry, threw herself back in her seat. The sound was heard by the people about Ali, who instantly opened the box-door. \"Why, count,\" exclaimed Eugénie, \"what has happened to your ward? she seems to have been taken suddenly ill.\" \\n\\n \"Very probably,\" answered the count. \"But do not be alarmed on her account. Haidée\u0027s nervous system is delicately organized, and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers--nay, there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence. However,\" continued Monte Cristo, drawing a small phial from his pocket, \"I have an infallible remedy.\" So saying, he bowed to the baroness and her daughter, exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count, and left Madame Danglars\u0027 box. Upon his return to Haidée he found her still very pale. As soon as she saw him she seized his hand; her own hands were moist and icy cold. \"Who was it you were talking with over there?\" she asked. \\n\\n \"With the Count of Morcerf,\" answered Monte Cristo. \"He tells me he served your illustrious father, and that he owes his fortune to him.\" \\n\\n \"Wretch!\" exclaimed Haidée, her eyes flashing with rage; \"he sold my father to the Turks, and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery! Did not you know that, my dear lord?\" \\n\\n \"Something of this I heard in Epirus,\" said Monte Cristo; \"but the particulars are still unknown to me. You shall relate them to me, my child. They are, no doubt, both curious and interesting.\" \\n\\n \"Yes, yes; but let us go. I feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man.\" So saying, Haidée arose, and wrapping herself in her burnoose of white cashmire embroidered with pearls and coral, she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act. \\n\\n 和人约定要去看戏这个借口倒是很能令人相信的，因为碰巧那天晚上皇家戏院比平时更具吸引力。生了一场大病之后的李凡塞［李凡塞（一七九一—一八七一），法国歌剧演员——译注］重登舞台，扮演伯脱兰一角，而象往常一样，只要一宣布上演当代走红的作曲家最受崇拜的作品，就可以吸引来大批观众，包括巴黎上流社会的“精华”在内。象大多数有钱有地位的青年人一样，马尔塞夫在正厅前座有一个座位。此外，他还有权可以进“狮子”包厢。夏多·勒诺也买了一张前座票，座位就在他的旁边，而波尚凭着他那报馆编辑的资格，是可以在戏院里自由地满场飞的。那天晚上部长的包厢碰巧交给吕西安·德布雷去自由地支配，德布雷就把它送给了马尔塞夫伯爵，而马尔塞夫伯爵因为美塞苔丝不肯去，就转赠给了腾格拉尔，并暗示说，假如他们接受了那个包厢，他那天晚上或许会来和男爵夫人及她的女儿一同观剧的。腾格拉尔夫人和小姐接到这项赠送简直太高兴了，怎么也不会谢绝的。世界上再没有人比一位百万富翁更乐于接受一个不花钱的戏院包厢了。 \\n\\n 但腾格拉尔宣称，他的政治主张和他作为一个反对派议员是不允许他使用部长的包厢的，所以男爵夫人就写了一个条子给吕西安·德布雷，要他来拜访她们，因为她是不能单独带着欧热妮上戏院去的。的确，假如这两个女人不带一个护送者到戏院里去，社会上就会对此加以恶意的曲解的。但如果腾格拉尔小姐跟着她的母亲和她母亲的情人上戏院去，社会人士就无懈可击了。我们对于社会上的事情是只能随众同俗的。 \\n\\n 大幕拉开的时候，象往常一样，戏院几乎是空的，这也是巴黎上流社会的荒唐风气之一，戏不开始是决不肯在戏院里出现的，所以第一幕的演出通常是丝毫没人注意的，那些已经到场的观众也都在忙着在观察新到的看客，那开门关门的闹声，再加上谈话的嗡嗡声，简直使人无法再听到一些别的什么。 \\n\\n “瞧，”当第一排一个包厢的门打开的时候，阿尔贝说道，“Ｇ伯爵夫人来了。” \\n\\n “请问，她是谁呀？”夏多·勒诺问道。 \\n\\n “噢，伯爵！这句话问得可太不能原谅了，你竟问我Ｇ伯爵夫人是谁？” \\n\\n “啊，真的！”夏多·勒诺说道，“我现在记起来了，是你那位可爱的威尼斯人，是不是？” \\n\\n “正是她。” \\n\\n 这时，伯爵夫人已看到了阿尔贝，并用一个微笑回答了他的致敬。 \\n\\n “看来你好象认识她？”夏多·勒诺说道。 \\n\\n “是的。是弗兰兹在罗马把我介绍给她的。”阿尔贝说道。 \\n\\n “好，那么，你愿不愿意在巴黎为我做那件他在罗马为你做的事？” \\n\\n “乐意之至。” \\n\\n “不要讲话了！”观众喊道。 \\n\\n 这表明有一部分观众很想享受一下当时从舞台上和乐队里传出来的美妙的音乐，但那种表明示这两个青年并没有产生什么作用，他们继续谈着话，象是根本没听见似的。 \\n\\n “马尔斯跑马场的赛马伯爵夫人也去看了的。”夏多·勒诺说。 \\n\\n “今天？” \\n\\n “是的。” \\n\\n “糟糕！我把赛马都给忘了。你下赌注了没有？” \\n\\n “噢，小数目——五十个路易。” \\n\\n “哪一匹赢了？” \\n\\n “诺铁路斯。我赌的就是它。” \\n\\n “一共有三场赛马，是不是？” \\n\\n “是的，骑士俱乐部送了一个锦标——一只金杯。你知道，那场赛马会上发生了一件非常稀奇的事。” \\n\\n “什么事？” \\n\\n “不要讲话了！”爱音乐的那一部分观众又怒吼了起来。 \\n\\n “嘿，那锦标竟被大家完全不熟悉的一匹马和一个骑师夺了去。” \\n\\n “有这样的事？” \\n\\n “一点都不假。谁也没注意到参赛的马中有一匹名叫万帕的马和一个名叫贾布的骑师。突然地，出发地点来了一匹枣骝马和一个象你的拳头差不多大的骑师。他们至少得在那个小骑师的口袋里塞一个二十磅重的铅丸才能使他够重量，但尽管如此，他还是超出了和他竞争的阿里尔和巴柏，至少整整超出了三个马身。” \\n\\n “后来有没有查明那匹马和那个骑师是属于谁的？” \\n\\n “没有。” \\n\\n “你说那匹马的名字是叫” \\n\\n “万帕。” \\n\\n “那么，”阿尔贝答道，“我的消息要比你灵通了，我知道那匹马的主人是谁了！” \\n\\n “那边不要讲话了！”观众里面又有人喊道。而这一次，由于那种命令的口吻里含着明显的敌意，这两个青年人才初次觉察到那个命令原来是冲着他们发的。他们转过头来，向人群里搜索着，究竟是谁敢对那种他们认为无礼的行为负责，但没有一个人来应答这种挑衅，于是这两位朋友就又把脸转到了舞台上。这时，部长包厢的门开了，腾格拉尔夫人，她的女儿和吕西安·德布雷进来入座了。 \\n\\n “哈，哈！”夏多·勒诺说，“那儿又来了你的几个朋友啦，子爵！你在那儿看什么呀？你没看见他们想引起你的注意吗？” \\n\\n 阿尔贝及时转过头来，刚巧看到男爵夫人对他和蔼地摇了摇扇子，至于欧热妮小姐，她是很少给恩赐她那一对黑色大眼睛的秋波的，甚至对舞台上望一眼都难得。 \\n\\n “我告诉你，亲爱的，”夏多·勒诺说，“我想象不出腾格拉尔小姐有什么使你不满意的地方。就是说，暂且不管她的门第，在那方面她自然低了一点，但我想你也不见得会十分计较的。倒是我觉得她是一个非常漂亮的姑娘。” \\n\\n “要说漂亮，那当然罗，”阿尔贝回答说，“但她不合我的口味，我承认我喜欢一个比她更柔弱更温顺和更女性化的人。” \\n\\n “啊唷唷！”夏多·勒诺大声说道，他因为自己是一个三十岁的人，所以就对马瑟夫做出了一种父辈的神气，“你们年轻人是从来不知满足的。你还想要好到什么程度呀？你父母给你选的这位新娘就是把她当作一位活的狩猎女神也满可以说得过去的，可是你还不满足。” \\n\\n “不，就因为她象狩猎女神我才害怕呢。我倒喜欢五谷女神或畜牧女神的那种风度。至于这位性喜狩猎的女神，她的身边老是围绕着山灵水妖，我可有点心慌，深恐有一天她会使我落得个蚌壳精的下场。” \\n\\n 的确，你只要向腾格拉尔小姐看一眼，就可以发现马尔塞夫所说的她身上所有的那种特征。她很漂亮，但是，正如阿尔贝所说的，美得未免有点太锋芒毕露了。她的头发象炭一般黑，但在它那种很自然的波浪之中，可以观察到它拒绝受别人摆布的某种抗拒力。她的眼睛和她的头发同色，睫毛很浓密，上面有两条弯弯的眉毛，但她的眉毛有一个大缺点，就是几乎老是习惯蹙皱着，她的整个脸上总带着一种刚毅坚决的表情，颇不具备女性的那种温柔。她的鼻子的形状很适合做雕刻家塑朱诺［希腊神话中宇宙大神之妻——译注］的模特儿，她的嘴里一口珍珠般雪白的牙齿，嘴巴的缺点或许是太大了一些，而且，由于她的嘴唇过分的红，就更引人注目，也使得她那苍白的皮肤似乎显得更缺少血色。在这个几乎象男人的脸（就是马尔塞夫觉得极不合他口味的脸）上更加重了男性气味的，是一颗比一般雀斑大得多的黑痣，正巧长在她的嘴角上，这更加强了她脸上那种坚定不移和倔强独立的表情。欧热妮小姐身体上其余的部分和刚才形容过的那个头部十分相称，正如夏多·勒诺所说的，她的确会使你想到狩猎女神，只是她的美更富于阳刚之气，更近于男性的美罢了。论到她的学识，唯一可能找到的缺点，和一个苛求的鉴赏家在她的美貌上所能找到的一样，就是那些学识象是属于男性的。她能讲两三种语言，是一个很好的艺术家，能写诗，会作曲。她公开宣称要终生献身于音乐这门艺术，正和她的一位同学在共同研究它，她那位同学没有钱，却具备各种条件可以成为——她确信她可以成为——一个出色的歌唱家。据说有一位鼎鼎大名的作曲家对在此提到的这位青年女子抱有一种几乎近于慈父般的关切，他鼓励她要勤勉地学习，希望她可以凭她的嗓子致富。由于罗茜·亚密莱小姐将来或许会上舞台，所以腾格拉尔小姐虽然仍把她收留在家里，却不便和她一同在公共场所露面。虽然罗茜在那位银行家的家里享受不到一个朋友的独立地位，但她的地位却比一个普通的女家庭教师要优越得多。 \\n\\n 腾格拉尔夫人进了她的包厢以后，大幕几乎立刻就落了下来。在幕落幕启之间，照例有一段休息时间，乐队离开了舞台前面半圆形的乐池，观众也可以自由地到休息室或前厅里去散步，在他们的包厢里接待客人或去拜访他们朋友的包厢。 \\n\\n 马尔塞夫和夏多·勒诺也是最先利用这种机会的人之一。腾格拉尔夫人最初以为那位年轻的子爵急急地起身是要到她这儿来，便向她的女儿耳语说，阿尔贝正急匆匆地要来拜访她们了。但后者却微笑着摇了摇头。正在这时，象是要证明她的怀疑的确是很有根据似的，马尔塞夫已在第一排的一个包厢里出现了，那是Ｇ伯爵夫人的包厢。 \\n\\n “啊！您来啦，阁下，”伯爵夫人大声说道，并极其亲热地把手伸给了他，象老朋友似的，“您这样快就认出了我真是太好啦，尤其是您竟先来看我。” \\n\\n “您完全可以相信这一点”阿尔贝答道，“假如我知道您已经到了巴黎，并且知道您的住址，我早就来向您问候啦。请允许我介绍一下我的这位朋友，夏多·勒诺伯爵，是目前在法国难得找到的几位世家子弟之一。我刚才从他那儿得知，您昨天到马尔斯跑马场去看赛马了。” \\n\\n 夏多·勒诺向伯爵夫人了一躬。 \\n\\n “啊！你也去看赛马了吗，阁下？”伯爵夫人急切地问道。 \\n\\n “是的，夫人。” \\n\\n “哦，那么，”Ｇ伯爵夫人很兴奋地追问道，“您也许能告诉我，夺得骑士俱乐部锦标的那匹马是属于谁的？” \\n\\n “真是抱歉得很，我只能说不知道，”伯爵回答说，“我刚才也正在向阿尔贝问这个问题。” \\n\\n “您急于想知道吗，伯爵夫人？”阿尔贝问道。 \\n\\n “知道什么？” \\n\\n “那匹夺标的马的主人？” \\n\\n “想极啦，你们且想想看，怎么，子爵阁下，您知道他是谁吗？” \\n\\n “夫人，您刚才好象正要讲一个故事。因为您说“你们且想想看。’” \\n\\n “哦，那么，听着！你们一定知道，我很关心那匹漂亮的的枣骝马和那个别有风味地穿着一件粉红色绸短衫，戴粉红色软缎便帽的风流的小骑师，我当时禁不住热切地祈祷他们能获胜，就象是我有一半家产押在他们身上似的，当看到他们超过了所有其他的马，以那样漂亮的姿态向终点跑来的时候，我兴奋得拍起手来。回家的时候，我在楼梯上遇到了那个穿粉红短衫的骑师，想想看，当时我是多么的惊奇的啊！我还以为那匹获胜的马的主人一定碰巧，和我住在同一家旅馆里呢。但不是的！我一走进我的客厅，就看到了那只奖给那来历不明的马和骑师的金杯，杯子里有一张小纸条，上面写着：‘Ｇ——伯爵夫人惠存，罗思文勋爵敬赠。’” \\n\\n “一点不错，我早就料到了。”马尔塞夫说道。 \\n\\n “料到了什么？” \\n\\n “那匹马的主人是罗思文勋爵。” \\n\\n “您指的是哪一位罗思文勋爵？” \\n\\n “咦，我们所说的那位罗思文勋爵呀——爱根狄诺戏院的那个僵尸！” \\n\\n “真的？”伯爵夫人大声说道，“那么，他也在这儿吗？” \\n\\n “当然罗，为什么不呢？” \\n\\n “您去拜访过他吗？在您府上和别处都见过他吗？” \\n\\n “实话告诉您，他是我最亲密的朋友，夏多·勒诺先生也有幸拜识过他。” \\n\\n “但您凭什么认为那夺标的就是他呢？” \\n\\n “那匹获胜的马不是以‘万帕’这个名字来参赛的吗？” \\n\\n “那又怎么样？” \\n\\n “咦，难道您不记得那个把我绑去的大名鼎鼎的强盗叫什么名字了吗？” \\n\\n “啊！不错。” \\n\\n “而伯爵又是怎么极其神妙地把我从他的手里救出来的了吗？” \\n\\n “当然记得。” \\n\\n “他的名字就叫万帕。所以，您瞧，就是他。” \\n\\n “但他为什么要把那奖杯送给我呢？” \\n\\n “第一，因为我对他常常谈起您，这是您可以意料得到的；第二，因为他很高兴看到一位女同胞，并且很高兴看到她这样热心地关切他的胜利。” \\n\\n “我希望您从没有把我们常常评论他的那些傻话都背给他听吧？” \\n\\n “我不想发誓说我没有讲过。而且，他以罗思文勋爵的名义把奖杯送给您，证明他已经知道有人在把他比作那个人了。” \\n\\n “噢，那简直太可怕啦！那人一定恨死我了。” \\n\\n “可他这个举动很难说是出于敌意的呀。” \\n\\n “不，当然不。” \\n\\n “嗯，那么” \\n\\n “那么他到巴黎来吗？” \\n\\n “是的。” \\n\\n “他在社会上产生了什么影响？” \\n\\n “嘿，“阿尔贝说道，“他被整整地谈论了一个星期。接着就来了英国王后的加冕典礼和马尔斯小姐的钻石失窃案，而那两件极有趣的大事就把大众的注意力转移到别的地方上去了。” \\n\\n “亲爱的，”夏多·勒诺说道，“这分明因为伯爵是你的朋友，所以你对他才不免有点袒护。别相信阿尔贝对您说的话，伯爵夫人，我敢负责地说一句：自从基督山伯爵出现以来，他在巴黎社交界一直轰动到现在，始终没有平息过。他来到以后的第一桩惊人之举便是送一对价值三万法郎的马给了腾格拉尔夫人；第二件，他奇迹般地保全了维尔福夫人的性命；现在似乎又是他夺去了骑士俱乐部所赠的锦标！所以不管我认为马尔塞夫怎么说，伯爵不但在目前这个时候是大家所瞩目的焦点，而且假如他继续表演那种在他似乎是家常便饭，而在在我们却觉得稀奇古怪的举动，他让可以再轰动一个月的。” \\n\\n “也许你说得不错，”马尔塞夫说道，“但先告诉我，俄国大使的那个包厢让给谁啦？” \\n\\n “您是指哪个包厢？”伯爵夫人问道。 \\n\\n “第一排两根柱子之间的那一个，它似乎已全部改装过了。” \\n\\n “的确改装过了，”夏多·勒诺说道。“第一幕的时候那儿有人吗？” \\n\\n “哪儿？” \\n\\n “那个包厢里。” \\n\\n “没有，”伯爵夫人答道，“第一幕的时候当然是空着的。” \\n\\n 说完这句话，她又回到他们刚才的那个话题上，说道，“那么您真的相信夺标的就是那位基督山伯爵了？” \\n\\n “对这一点我敢肯定。” \\n\\n “而后来他又把那只奖杯送给了我？” \\n\\n “那是毫无疑问的了。” \\n\\n “可我并不认识他呀，”伯爵夫人说道，“我很想把它退回去。” \\n\\n “我求您别那么干，那样的话，他只会再送您一只用翡翠或极大的红宝石雕成的杯子。这是他的一贯作风，您只能迁就他一下了。” \\n\\n 这时，铃声宣布第二幕就要开始了。阿尔贝站起来准备回到他自己的座位上去。 \\n\\n “我还能再见到你们吗？”伯爵夫人问道。 \\n\\n “假如允许我在下一次休息的时候再来拜访您的话，我一定要请问一下在巴黎有没有我能为您效劳的地方？” \\n\\n “请注意，”伯爵夫人说道，“我目前的住处是在黎伏莱路二十二号，每星期六晚上我总是在家招待朋友们的。所以你们二位现在可不能再说不知道啦。” \\n\\n 两个青年鞠了一躬，便离开了那个包厢。当他们回到自己的座位上的时候，他们才发觉正厅里的全部观众都已经站了起来，正目光一致地望着以前俄国大使包用的那个包厢。那儿刚进来了一个年约三十五至四十岁，身穿深黑衣服的男子，和他在一起的，还有一位穿东方式服装的女人。那个女人很年轻，而且非常美，她那身华丽的打扮把所有的目光都吸引到了她的身上。 \\n\\n “哎呀！”阿尔贝说道，“那正是基督山和他的那个希腊女人呀！” \\n\\n 这两位陌生人的确就是伯爵和海黛。后者的美丽和她那种眩目的装束所引起的轰动不久就传遍了戏院的每一个角落，太太小姐们都从她们的包厢里探出身来，观看那闪闪发光的繁星般的钻石。在第二幕演出期间，戏院里一直充满着嗡嗡的声音，在一个拥挤的集会场所里，这种声音就是表示已发生了一件惊人的大事，谁都想不到要人们安静下来。因为那个女人是这样的年轻，这样的美丽，这样的眩目，她就是眼前最动人的一幕。这时，腾格拉尔夫人作了一个不容误会的表示，示意她很希望第二幕的幕一落就在她的包厢里看到阿尔贝，且不要说马尔塞夫本来就很愿意，单是从礼貌上讲，也不允许他漠视一个表示得这样明显的邀请。所以在那一幕之后，他就走到了男爵夫人的包厢里。他先向太太和小姐鞠了一躬，然后便把手伸给了德布雷。男爵夫人极其殷勤地欢迎他，而瓦朗蒂娜则照常对他很冷淡。 \\n\\n “亲爱的！”德布雷说道，“你来了太好了，正巧可以来救救一个走投无路的人。夫人没头没脑地向我提出了许多有关伯爵的问题，她坚持以为我能够把他的出身、教育、门第、从哪儿来、要到哪儿去等种种事情都告诉她。由于没有撒谎的本领，我就推托说：去问马尔塞夫吧，基督山的全部身世都源源本本地在他肚子里呢。’所以男爵夫人就向你示意，叫你过来了。” \\n\\n “一个至少有五十万秘密钱财可以动用的人，”腾格拉尔夫人说道，“他的消息竟会这样不灵通，这不是简直令人难以相信吗？” \\n\\n “我向您发誓，夫人，”吕西安说道，“假如我真的有您所说的那笔款子可以动用的话，我也会把它用到较有益的地方，而不会自找麻烦地打听基督山伯爵的种种细节的。在我的眼里，他唯一的长处就是他比一个印度王公还要富有一倍而已。但是，我已经把这事转交给马尔塞夫了，所以请您去和他解决吧，现在不再关我的事了。” \\n\\n “我敢绝对肯定没有哪一个印度王公会送我一对价值三万法郎的马，还给马头戴上四颗每颗价值五千法郎的钻石。” \\n\\n “他好象是有钻石癖，”马尔塞夫微笑着说道，“我确信他象俄国亲王波亭金一样，一定在口袋里装满了钻石，沿路抛撒，就象小孩子撒打火石似的。” \\n\\n “也许他发现了一个矿，”腾格拉尔夫人说道，”我想您大概已经知道了，他在男爵的银行里开具了无限期货款担保。” \\n\\n “我倒不知道这事，”阿尔贝回答说，“但我完全可以相信。” \\n\\n “他对腾格拉尔先生说，他只准备在巴黎住一年，在那段时间里，他准备花掉六百万，他一定是那位微服出游的波斯国王。” \\n\\n “您有没有注意到那个陪他来的年轻女人长得美极了，吕西安先生？”瓦朗蒂娜问道。 \\n\\n “我的确从来没见过这样一个可以和您媲美的女人。”吕西安把观剧望远镜凑到了他的眼睛上。“真可爱！”他说道。 \\n\\n “这个年轻的女人是谁，马尔塞夫先生？”瓦朗蒂娜问道，“有谁知道吗？” \\n\\n “小姐，”阿尔贝对这一句直接的问话答复说。“关于这一点，象许多有关我们现在所谈到的这位奇人的事情一样，我也是只知道一点儿。那个年轻的女人是个希腊人。” \\n\\n “这一点我从她的着装上就可以看得出来，假如您除了那一件明摆着的事实以外别无所知的话，这个戏院里的全部观众都可以说得上和您同样消息灵通的了。” \\n\\n “我很抱歉使您觉得我竟是一个这样无知的‘向导’，”马尔塞夫答道，“但我不得不承认，我实在再没什么别的事情可以奉告的了。噢，不，有了，我还知道一件事，就是，她是位音乐演奏家，因为有一天，当我在伯爵家里用早餐的时候，碰巧听到一架ｇｕｚｌａ琴的声音，那种琴声当然只有她才能弹得出来的。” \\n\\n “那么您那位伯爵也招待客人了？”腾格拉尔夫人问道。 \\n\\n “他的确是招待的，而且以最高贵的方式，这一点我可以向您担保。” \\n\\n “我一定要劝腾格拉尔先生邀请他过来吃一顿饭或跳一次舞什么的，好使他不得不回请我们。” \\n\\n “什么！”德布雷大笑着说道，“您真的要到他家里去吗！” \\n\\n “为什么不呢，我丈夫可以陪我去的。” \\n\\n “但您不知道这位神秘的伯爵是一个单身汉吗？” \\n\\n “假如您向对面望一望，”男爵夫人带笑指了指那个美丽的希腊女人说道，“您就可以充分得到相反的证据啦。” \\n\\n “不，不！”德布雷大声说话，“那个女人不是他的太太。他曾亲自告诉我们说她是他的奴隶。马尔塞夫，你记不记得他在你那里吃早餐的时候曾这样告诉过我们？” \\n\\n “嗯，那么，”男爵夫人说道，“假如说她是个奴隶，可她的神态和气质却完全象是一位公主。” \\n\\n “是《一千零一夜》里的吗？” \\n\\n “随便您怎么说好了，但是告诉我，亲爱的吕西安，什么是一位公主的标志？论钻石，她可全身都是钻石啊。” \\n\\n “我觉得她似乎戴得太多了一点，”瓦朗蒂娜说道。“假如她戴得少一点，她就会好看得多了，那样我们就可以看到她那秀丽细腻的脖颈和手腕了。” \\n\\n “看！多象艺术家的门吻！”腾格拉尔夫人大声说道，“我可怜的瓦朗蒂娜，你还是把你对于美术的热情收起来吧。” \\n\\n “我对于人工或自然的美都都同样地能欣赏。”那位小姐回答说。 \\n\\n “那么，您觉得伯爵怎么样？”德布雷问道，“他倒不全违背我心目中所谓好看的标准。” \\n\\n “伯爵？”瓦朗蒂娜把这两个字重复了一遍，象是她还没有观察过他似的，“伯爵？噢，他的脸色苍白得太可怕了。” \\n\\n “我很同意您的看法，”马尔塞夫说道，“而就在那种苍白下面，正隐藏着我们想知道的秘密。Ｇ伯爵夫人坚持说他是一具僵尸。” \\n\\n “那么说伯爵夫人已回到巴黎来了？”男爵夫人问道。 \\n\\n “她在那边哪，妈妈，”瓦朗蒂娜说道，“几乎就在我们的对面，你没瞧见那一头浓密的浅色的漂亮头发吗？” \\n\\n “是的，是的，她在那边！”腾格拉尔夫人大声说道，“我可以对您说您应该做的事吗，马尔塞夫？” \\n\\n “请给我下命令吧，夫人，我在这儿洗耳恭听呢。” \\n\\n “嗯，那么，您应该去把那位基督山伯爵带到我们这儿来。” \\n\\n “为什么？”瓦朗蒂娜问道。 \\n\\n “为什么？咦，当然是和他说说话呀，看看他的谈吐是否和别人一样，假如你没有这种好奇心，老实说我倒是有。你真的不想见他吗？” \\n\\n “一点都不想。”瓦朗蒂娜回答说。 \\n\\n “怪丫头！”男爵夫人低声说道。 \\n\\n “他多半会自动过来的，”马尔塞夫说道。“嘶，您瞧见了吗，夫人？ \\n\\n “他认出了您，正在向您鞠躬呢。” \\n\\n 男爵夫人满脸堆笑地以最殷勤的态度回复了那个礼。 \\n\\n “好吧，”马尔塞夫说道，“我就是牺牲自己好了。再会，我去瞧瞧有没有机会可以跟他讲话。” \\n\\n “径直到他的包厢里去，这是最简单的办法。” \\n\\n “但我从没有经过介绍呀。” \\n\\n “介绍给谁？” \\n\\n “那个希腊美人。” \\n\\n “您不是说她只是一个奴隶吗？” \\n\\n “可您却坚持说她是一位公主呀。不，不，我不敢进他的包厢，但我希望他看见我离开了你们，就会从他的包厢走出来。” \\n\\n “这是很可能的，去吧。” \\n\\n 马尔塞夫鞠躬以后就走了出去。正当他经过伯爵的包厢，门开了，基督山走了出来。他先向那站在休息室里的阿里吩咐了几句话，然后就招呼了一声阿尔贝，并挽着他的手臂向前走去。阿里小心地把包厢门关上，自己站在门前，一群好奇的观众在这个黑人周围聚拢着。 \\n\\n “说老实话。”基督山说道，“巴黎真是一个奇怪的城市，而巴黎人也是非常奇怪的人民。就好象他们生平第一次看到一个黑人似的。瞧，他们都挤在可怜的阿里周围，弄得他莫名其妙的。我向您保证，一个法国人不论到突尼斯、君士坦丁堡、巴格达或开罗去，他尽可以在公众场所露面，而他的周围决不会有人围观的。” \\n\\n “这证明东方人的头脑是很清醒的，他们决不会把他们的时间和注意力浪费到不值得注意的目标上。然而，单就阿里来说，我敢对您说，他之所以能引起别人的兴趣，就是因为他是属于您的，而您目前可是巴黎最红的人物啊。” \\n\\n “真的吗？我怎么会幸运地得到这样一种荣誉呢？” \\n\\n “怎么会？咦，当然是您自己造成的呀！您拿价值一千路易的马来送人；您救了一位既有地位又漂亮的太太的性命；您以布莱克参谋先生的名义去参加赛马，派去了纯种的骏马和并不比土拨鼠大多少的骑师；当您夺得了奖杯以后，却毫不珍惜它，把它送给了您所想得到的第一个漂亮女人。” \\n\\n “这些荒唐的念头是谁拿来放在您脑子里的？” \\n\\n “咦。第一件，我是从腾格拉尔夫人那儿听来的，顺便提一句，她极盼望您能到她的包厢里去，那儿还有别的人也想见您；第二件，我是从波堂的报纸上看到的；第三件，是我自己想出来的。咦，假如您想不被人知道的话，您干嘛要把那匹马叫作万帕呢？” \\n\\n “那的确是一个漏洞，”伯爵答道，“但请告诉我，马尔塞夫伯爵难道从来不上戏院的吗？我刚才望了一遍，但始终没能看到他。” \\n\\n “他今天晚上会来的。”
