{"id":43940,"no":72,"title":"Chapter 77 Haidée","content":"SCARCELY HAD the count\u0027s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard, than Albert, turning towards the count, burst into a loud fit of laughter--much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural. \"Well,\" said he, \"I will ask you the same question which Charles IX. put to Catherine de Medicis, after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew, \u0027How have I played my little part?\u0027\" \"To what do you allude?\" asked Monte Cristo. \"To the installation of my rival at M. Danglars\u0027.\" \"What rival?\" \"Ma foi! what rival? Why, your protege, M. Andrea Cavalcanti!\" \"Ah, no joking, viscount, if you please; I do not patronize M. Andrea--at least, not as concerns M. Danglars.\" \"And you would be to blame for not assisting him, if the young man really needed your help in that quarter, but, happily for me, he can dispense with it.\" \"What, do you think he is paying his addresses?\" \"I am certain of it; his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his intentions. He aspires to the hand of the proud Eugénie.\" \"What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?\" \"But it is not the case, my dear count: on the contrary. I am repulsed on all sides.\" \"What!\" \"It is so indeed; Mademoiselle Eugénie scarcely answers me, and Mademoiselle d\u0027Armilly, her confidant, does not speak to me at all.\" \"But the father has the greatest regard possible for you,\" said Monte Cristo. \"He? Oh, no, he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart, tragedy-weapons, I own, which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles, but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly.\" \"Jealousy indicates affection.\" \"True; but I am not jealous.\" \"He is.\" \"Of whom?--of Debray?\" \"No, of you.\" \"Of me? I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me.\" \"You are mistaken, my dear viscount.\" \"Prove it to me.\" \"Do you wish me to do so?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the Comte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron.\" \"By whom are you charged?\" \"By the baron himself.\" \"Oh,\" said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable. \"You surely will not do that, my dear count?\" \"Certainly I shall, Albert, as I have promised to do it.\" \"Well,\" said Albert, with a sigh, \"it seems you are determined to marry me.\" \"I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody, at all events,\" said Monte Cristo. \"But apropos of Debray, how is it that I have not seen him lately at the baron\u0027s house?\" \"There has been a misunderstanding.\" \"What, with the baroness?\" \"No, with the baron.\" \"Has he perceived anything?\" \"Ah, that is a good joke!\" \"Do you think he suspects?\" said Monte Cristo with charming artlessness. \"Where have you come from, my dear count?\" said Albert. \"From Congo, if you will.\" \"It must be farther off than even that.\" \"But what do I know of your Parisian husbands?\" \"Oh, my dear count, husbands are pretty much the same everywhere; an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race.\" \"But then, what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and Debray? They seemed to understand each other so well,\" said Monte Cristo with renewed energy. \"Ah, now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis, in which I am not initiated. When M. Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of the family, you can ask him that question.\" The carriage stopped. \"Here we are,\" said Monte Cristo; \"it is only half-past ten o\u0027clock, come in.\" \"Certainly I will.\" \"My carriage shall take you back.\" \"No, thank you; I gave orders for my coupé to follow me.\" \"There it is, then,\" said Monte Cristo, as he stepped out of the carriage. They both went into the house; the drawing-room was lighted up--they went in there. \"You will make tea for us, Baptistin,\" said the count. Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer, and in two seconds reappeared, bringing on a waiter all that his master had ordered, ready prepared, and appearing to have sprung from the ground, like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales. \"Really, my dear count,\" said Morcerf. \"what I admire in you is, not so much your riches, for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself, nor is it only your wit, for Beaumarchais might have possessed as much,--but it is your manner of being served, without any questions, in a moment, in a second; it is as it they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing, and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness.\" \"What you say is perhaps true; they know my habits. For instance, you shall see; how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea-time?\" \"Ma foi! I should like to smoke.\" Monte Cristo took the gong and struck it once. In about the space of a second a private door opened, and Ali appeared, bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia. \"It is quite wonderful,\" said Albert. \"Oh no, it is as simple as possible,\" replied Monte Cristo. \"Ali knows I generally smoke while I am taking my tea or coffee; he has heard that I ordered tea, and he also knows that I brought you home with me; when I summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so, and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking, he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company, and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one--and now the mystery is solved.\" \"Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation, but it is not the less true that you--Ah, but what do I hear?\" and Morcerf inclined his head towards the door, through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar. \"Ma foi! my dear viscount, you are fated to hear music this evening; you have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars\u0027 piano, to be attacked by Haidée\u0027s guzla.\" \"Haidée--what an adorable name! Are there, then, really women who bear the name of Haidée anywhere but in Byron\u0027s poems?\" \"Certainly there are. Haidée is a very uncommon name in France, but is common enough in Albania and Epirus; it is as it you said, for example, Chastity, Modesty, Innocence,--it is a kind of baptismal name, as you Parisians call it.\" \"Oh, that is charming,\" said Albert, \"how I should like to hear my countrywomen called Mademoiselle Goodness, Mademoiselle Silence, Mademoiselle Christian Charity! Only think, then, if Mademoiselle Danglars, instead of being called Claire-Marie-Eugénie, had been named Mademoiselle Chastity-Modesty-Innocence Danglars; what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage!\" \"Hush,\" said the count, \"do not joke in so loud a tone; Haidée may hear you, perhaps.\" \"And you think she would be angry?\" \"No, certainly not,\" said the count with a haughty expression. \"She is very amiable, then, is she not?\" said Albert. \"It is not to be called amiability, it is her duty; a slave does not dictate to a master.\" \"Come; you are joking yourself now. Are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name?\" \"Undoubtedly.\" \"Really, count, you do nothing, and have nothing like other people. The slave of the Count of Monte Cristo! Why, it is a rank of itself in France, and from the way in which you lavish money, it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year.\" \"A hundred thousand francs! The poor girl originally possessed much more than that; she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the Thousand and One Nights would seem but poverty.\" \"She must be a princess then.\" \"You are right; and she is one of the greatest in her country too.\" \"I thought so. But how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave?\" \"How was it that Dionysius the Tyrant became a schoolmaster? The fortune of war, my dear viscount,--the caprice of fortune; that is the way in which these things are to be accounted for.\" \"And is her name a secret?\" \"As regards the generality of mankind it is; but not for you, my dear viscount, who are one of my most intimate friends, and on whose silence I feel I may rely, if I consider it necessary to enjoin it--may I not do so?\" \"Certainly; on my word of honor.\" \"You know the history of the pasha of Yanina, do you not?\" \"Of Ali Tepelini?* Oh, yes; it was in his service that my father made his fortune.\" \"True, I had forgotten that.\" * Ali Pasha, \"The Lion,\" was born at Tepelini, an Albanian village at the foot of the Klissoura Mountains, in 1741. By diplomacy and success in arms he became almost supreme ruler of Albania, Epirus, and adjacent territory. Having aroused the enmity of the Sultan, he was proscribed and put to death by treachery in 1822, at the age of eighty.--Ed. \"Well, what is Haidée to Ali Tepelini?\" \"Merely his daughter.\" \"What? the daughter of Ali Pasha?\" \"Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasiliki.\" \"And your slave?\" \"Ma foi! yes.\" \"But how did she become so?\" \"Why, simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day, as I was passing through the market at Constantinople.\" \"Wonderful! Really, my dear count, you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned; when I listen to you, existence no longer seems reality, but a waking dream. Now, I am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request, but\"-- \"Say on.\" \"But, since you go out with Haidée, and sometimes even take her to the opera\"-- \"Well?\" \"I think I may venture to ask you this favor.\" \"You may venture to ask me anything.\" \"Well then, my dear count, present me to your princess.\" \"I will do so; but on two conditions.\" \"I accept them at once.\" \"The first is, that you will never tell any one that I have granted the interview.\" \"Very well,\" said Albert, extending his hand; \"I swear I will not.\" \"The second is, that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers.\" \"I give you my oath that I will not.\" \"Enough, viscount; you will remember those two vows, will you not? But I know you to be a man of honor.\" The count again struck the gong. Ali reappeared. \"Tell Haidée,\" said he, \"that I will take coffee with her, and give her to understand that I desire permission to present one of my friends to her.\" Ali bowed and left the room. \"Now, understand me,\" said the count, \"no direct questions, my dear Morcerf; if you wish to know anything, tell me, and I will ask her.\" \"Agreed.\" Ali reappeared for the third time, and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door, to signify to his master and Albert that they were at liberty to pass on. \"Let us go in,\" said Monte Cristo. Albert passed his hand through his hair, and curled his mustache, then, having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance, followed the count into the room, the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves. Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard, and the door was kept by the three French attendants, commanded by Myrtho. Haidée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments, which was the drawing-room. Her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation, for it was the first time that any man, except Monte Cristo, had been accorded an entrance into her presence. She was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room, with her legs crossed under her in the Eastern fashion, and seemed to have made for herself, as it were, a kind of nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped her. Near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing; it was elegantly fashioned, and worthy of its mistress. On perceiving Monte Cristo, she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself, expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love. Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand, which she as usual raised to her lips. Albert had proceeded no farther than the door, where he remained rooted to the spot, being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty, beheld as it was for the first time, and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea. \"Whom do you bring?\" asked the young girl in Romaic, of Monte Cristo; \"is it a friend, a brother, a simple acquaintance, or an enemy.\" \"A friend,\" said Monte Cristo in the same language. \"What is his name?\" \"Count Albert; it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the banditti at Rome.\" \"In what language would you like me to converse with him?\" Monte Cristo turned to Albert. \"Do you know modern Greek,\" asked he. \"Alas, no,\" said Albert; \"nor even ancient Greek, my dear count; never had Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than myself.\" \"Then,\" said Haidée, proving by her remark that she had quite understood Monte Cristo\u0027s question and Albert\u0027s answer, \"then I will speak either in French or Italian, if my lord so wills it.\" Monte Cristo reflected one instant. \"You will speak in Italian,\" said he. Then, turning towards Albert,--\"It is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern Greek, both of which Haidée speaks so fluently; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian, which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation.\" The count made a sign to Haidée to address his visitor. \"Sir,\" she said to Morcerf, \"you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master.\" This was said in excellent Tuscan, and with that soft Roman accent which makes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of Homer. Then, turning to Ali, she directed him to bring coffee and pipes, and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to her. Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew their seats towards a small table, on which were arranged music, drawings, and vases of flowers. Ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques; as to M. Baptistin, this portion of the building was interdicted to him. Albert refused the pipe which the Nubian offered him. \"Oh, take it--take it,\" said the count; \"Haidée is almost as civilized as a Parisian; the smell of an Havana is disagreeable to her, but the tobacco of the East is a most delicious perfume, you know.\" Ali left the room. The cups of coffee were all prepared, with the addition of sugar, which had been brought for Albert. Monte Cristo and Haidée took the beverage in the original Arabian manner, that is to say, without sugar. Haidée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes. At this moment two women entered, bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet, which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose. \"My dear host, and you, signora,\" said Albert, in Italian, \"excuse my apparent stupidity. I am quite bewildered, and it is natural that it should be so. Here I am in the heart of Paris; but a moment ago I heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade-sellers, and now I feel as if I were suddenly transported to the East; not such as I have seen it, but such as my dreams have painted it. Oh, signora, if I could but speak Greek, your conversation, added to the fairy-scene which surrounds me, would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget.\" \"I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you, sir,\" said Haidée quietly; \"and if you like what is Eastern, I will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here.\" \"On what subject shall I converse with her?\" said Albert, in a low tone to Monte Cristo. \"Just what you please; you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences, or if you like it better you can talk of Rome, Naples, or Florence.\" \"Oh,\" said Albert, \"it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if one converses just in the same style as with a Parisian; let me speak to her of the East.\" \"Do so then, for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste.\" Albert turned towards Haidée. \"At what age did you leave Greece, signora?\" asked he. \"I left it when I was but five years old,\" replied Haidée. \"And have you any recollection of your country?\" \"When I shut my eyes and think, I seem to see it all again. The mind can see as well as the body. The body forgets sometimes--but the mind never forgets.\" \"And how far back into the past do your recollections extend?\" \"I could scarcely walk when my mother, who was called Vasiliki, which means royal,\" said the young girl, tossing her head proudly, \"took me by the hand, and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed, we went out, both covered with veils, to solicit alms for the prisoners, saying, \u0027He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.\u0027 Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace, and without saying a word to my father, we sent it to the convent, where it was divided amongst the prisoners.\" \"And how old were you at that time?\" \"I was three years old,\" said Haidée. \"Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old?\" said Albert. \"Everything.\" \"Count,\" said Albert, in a low tone to Monte Cristo, \"do allow the signora to tell me something of her history. You prohibited my mentioning my father\u0027s name to her, but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital, and you have no idea how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips.\" Monte Cristo turned to Haidée, and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words, he said in Greek,--\"Tell us the fate of your father; but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason.\" Haidée sighed deeply, and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow. \"What are you saying to her?\" said Morcerf in an undertone. \"I again reminded her that you were a friend, and that she need not conceal anything from you.\" \"Then,\" said Albert, \"this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance; what is the next?\" \"Oh, then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamore-trees, on the borders of a lake, in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror. Under the oldest and thickest of these trees, reclining on cushions, sat my father; my mother was at his feet, and I, childlike, amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle, or with the diamond-hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle. Then from time to time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which I paid no attention, but which he always answered in the same tone of voice, either \u0027Kill,\u0027 or \u0027Pardon.\u0027\" \"It is very strange,\" said Albert, \"to hear such words proceed from the mouth of any one but an actress on the stage, and one needs constantly to be saying to one\u0027s self, \u0027This is no fiction, it is all reality,\u0027 in order to believe it. And how does France appear in your eyes, accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes?\" \"I think it is a fine country,\" said Haidée, \"but I see France as it really is, because I look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my own country, which I can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere, which is luminous or otherwise, according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous.\" \"So young,\" said Albert, forgetting at the moment the Count\u0027s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself, \"is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name?\" Haidée turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo, who, making at the same time some imperceptible sign, murmured,--\"Go on.\" \"Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood, and with the exception of the two scenes I have just described to you, all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness.\" \"Speak, speak, signora,\" said Albert, \"I am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say.\" Haidée answered his remark with a melancholy smile. \"You wish me, then, to relate the history of my past sorrows?\" said she. \"I beg you to do so,\" replied Albert. \"Well, I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened by my mother. We were in the palace of Yanina; she snatched me from the cushions on which I was sleeping, and on opening my eyes I saw hers filled with tears. She took me away without speaking. When I saw her weeping I began to cry too. \u0027Hush, child!\u0027 said she. At other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats, I had with a child\u0027s caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as I felt inclined; but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother\u0027s voice when she enjoined me to silence, that I ceased crying as soon as her command was given. She bore me rapidly away. \"I saw then that we were descending a large staircase; around us were all my mother\u0027s servants carrying trunks, bags, ornaments, jewels, purses of gold, with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction. \"Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols, and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation. You may imagine there was something startling and ominous,\" said Haidée, shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene, \"in this long file of slaves and women only half-aroused from sleep, or at least so they appeared to me, who was myself scarcely awake. Here and there on the walls of the staircase, were reflected gigantic shadows, which trembled in the flickering light of the pine-torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above. \"\u0027Quick!\u0027 said a voice at the end of the gallery. This voice made every one bow before it, resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat, by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance. As for me, it made me tremble. This voice was that of my father. He came last, clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him. He was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite Selim, and he drove us all before him, as a shepherd would his straggling flock. My father,\" said Haidée, raising her head, \"was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and before whom Turkey trembled.\" Albert, without knowing why, started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent; it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of Haidée at this moment; she appeared like a Pythoness evoking a spectre, as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man, to the news of which all Europe had listened with horror. \"Soon,\" said Haidée, \"we halted on our march, and found ourselves on the borders of a lake. My mother pressed me to her throbbing heart, and at the distance of a few paces I saw my father, who was glancing anxiously around. Four marble steps led down to the water\u0027s edge, and below them was a boat floating on the tide. \"From where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass; it was the kiosk to which we were going. This kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance, perhaps on account of the darkness of the night, which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned. We stepped into the boat. I remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water, and when I leaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our Palikares.* Besides the rowers, the boat contained only the women, my father, mother, Selim, and myself. The Palikares had remained on the shore of the lake, ready to cover our retreat; they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps, and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others, in case of pursuit. Our bark flew before the wind. \u0027Why does the boat go so fast?\u0027 asked I of my mother. * Greek militiamen in the war for independence.--Ed. \"\u0027Silence, child! Hush, we are flying!\u0027 I did not understand. Why should my father fly?--he, the all-powerful--he, before whom others were accustomed to fly--he, who had taken for his device, 　 \u0027THEY HATE ME; THEN THEY FEAR ME!\u0027 It was, indeed, a flight which my father was trying to effect. I have been told since that the garrison of the castle of Yanina, fatigued with long service\"-- Here Haidée cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo, whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative. The young girl then continued, speaking slowly, like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating. \"You were saying, signora,\" said Albert, who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital, \"that the garrison of Yanina, fatigued with long service\"-- \"Had treated with the Serasker Koorshid, who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father; it was then that Ali Tepelini--after having sent to the sultan a French officer in whom he reposed great confidence--resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself, and which he called kataphygion, or the refuge.\" \"And this officer,\" asked Albert, \"do you remember his name, signora?\" Monte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl, which was quite unperceived by Albert. \"No,\" said she, \"I do not remember it just at this moment; but if it should occur to me presently, I will tell you.\" Albert was on the point of pronouncing his father\u0027s name, when Monte Cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach; the young man recollected his promise, and was silent. \"It was towards this kiosk that we were rowing. A ground-floor, ornamented with arabesques, bathing its terraces in the water, and another floor, looking on the lake, was all which was visible to the eye. But beneath the ground-floor, stretching out into the island, was a large subterranean cavern, to which my mother, myself, and the women were conducted. In this place were together 60,000 pouches and 200 barrels; the pouches contained 25,000,000 of money in gold, and the barrels were filled with 30,000 pounds of gunpowder. \"Near the barrels stood Selim, my father\u0027s favorite, whom I mentioned to you just now. He stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand, and he had orders to blow up everything--kiosk, guards, women, gold, and Ali Tepelini himself--at the first signal given by my father. I remember well that the slaves, convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives, passed whole days and nights in praying, crying, and groaning. As for me, I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier, and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world, I am quite sure I shall recognize Selim. I cannot tell you how long we remained in this state; at that period I did not even know what time meant. Sometimes, but very rarely, my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace; these were hours of recreation for me, as I never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and Selim\u0027s fiery lance. My father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon, examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake, while my mother, reclining by his side, rested her head on his shoulder, and I played at his feet, admiring everything I saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves, but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance. The heights of Pindus towered above us; the castle of Yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake, and the immense masses of black vegetation which, viewed in the distance, gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks, were in reality gigantic fir-trees and myrtles. \"One morning my father sent for us; my mother had been crying all the night, and was very wretched; we found the pasha calm, but paler than usual. \u0027Take courage, Vasiliki,\u0027 said he; \u0027to-day arrives the firman of the master, and my fate will be decided. If my pardon be complete, we shall return triumphant to Yanina; if the news be inauspicious, we must fly this night.\u0027--\u0027But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so?\u0027 said my mother. \u0027Oh, make yourself easy on that head,\u0027 said Ali, smiling; \u0027Selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter. They would be glad to see me dead, but they would not like themselves to die with me.\u0027 \"My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my father\u0027s heart. She prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking,--for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever,--after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil, and lighted his chibouque, which he sometimes smoked for hours together, quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere. Presently he made such a sudden movement that I was paralyzed with fear. Then, without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention, he asked for his telescope. My mother gave it him. and as she did so, looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned. I saw my father\u0027s hand tremble. \u0027A boat!--two!--three!\u0027 murmured my, father;--\u0027four!\u0027 He then arose, seizing his arms and priming his pistols. \u0027Vasiliki,\u0027 said he to my mother, trembling perceptibly, \u0027the instant approaches which will decide everything. In the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor\u0027s answer. Go into the cavern with Haidée.\u0027--\u0027I will not quit you,\u0027 said Vasiliki; \u0027if you die, my lord, I will die with you.\u0027--\u0027Go to Selim!\u0027 cried my father. \u0027Adieu, my lord,\u0027 murmured my mother, determining quietly to await the approach of death. \u0027Take away Vasiliki!\u0027 said my father to his Palikares. \"As for me, I had been forgotten in the general confusion; I ran toward Ali Tepelini; he saw me hold out my arms to him, and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips. Oh, how distinctly I remember that kiss!--it was the last he ever gave me, and I feel as if it were still warm on my forehead. On descending, we saw through the lattice-work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view. At first they appeared like black specks, and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves. During this time, in the kiosk at my father\u0027s feet, were seated twenty Palikares, concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats. They were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother-of-pearl and silver, and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor. My father looked at his watch, and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish. This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last kiss. My mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern. Selim was still at his post, and smiled sadly on us as we entered. We fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern, and sat down by Selim. In great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other; and, young as I was, I quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads.\" Albert had often heard--not from his father, for he never spoke on the subject, but from strangers--the description of the last moments of the vizier of Yanina; he had read different accounts of his death, but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl, and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him. As to Haidée, these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment, for she ceased speaking, her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm; and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the Pindus and the blue waters of the lake of Yanina, which, like a magic mirror, seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched. Monte Cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity. \"Go on,\" said the count in the Romaic language. Haidée looked up abruptly, as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristo\u0027s voice had awakened her from a dream; and she resumed her narrative. \"It was about four o\u0027clock in the afternoon, and although the day was brilliant out-of-doors, we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern. One single, solitary light was burning there, and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness; it was Selim\u0027s flaming lance. My mother was a Christian, and she prayed. Selim repeated from time to time the sacred words: \u0027God is great!\u0027 However, my mother had still some hope. As she was coming down, she thought she recognized the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople, and in whom my father placed so much confidence; for he knew that all the soldiers of the French emperor were naturally noble and generous. She advanced some steps towards the staircase, and listened. \u0027They are approaching,\u0027 said she; \u0027perhaps they bring us peace and liberty!\u0027--\u0027What do you fear, Vasiliki?\u0027 said Selim, in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud. \u0027If they do not bring us peace, we will give them war; if they do not bring life, we will give them death.\u0027 And he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of Dionysus of Crete.* But I, being only a little child, was terrified by this undaunted courage, which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless, and I recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us. * The god of fruitfulness in Grecian mythology. In Crete he was supposed to be slain in winter with the decay of vegetation and to revive in the spring. Haidée\u0027s learned reference is to the behavior of an actor in the Dionysian festivals.--Ed. \"My mother experienced the same sensations, for I felt her tremble. \u0027Mamma, mamma,\u0027 said I, \u0027are we really to be killed?\u0027 And at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations. \u0027My child,\u0027 said Vasiliki, \u0027may God preserve you from ever wishing for that death which to-day you so much dread!\u0027 Then, whispering to Selim, she asked what were her master\u0027s orders. \u0027If he send me his poniard, it will signify that the emperor\u0027s intentions are not favorable, and I am to set fire to the powder; if, on the contrary, he send me his ring, it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him, and I am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched.\u0027--\u0027My friend,\u0027 said my mother, \u0027when your master\u0027s orders arrive, if it is the poniard which he sends, instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread, you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard, will you not?\u0027--\u0027Yes, Vasiliki,\u0027 replied Selim tranquilly. \"Suddenly we heard loud cries; and, listening, discerned that they were cries of joy. The name of the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares; it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor, and that it was favorable.\" \"And do you not remember the Frenchman\u0027s name?\" said Morcerf, quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator. Monte Cristo made a sign to him to be silent. \"I do not recollect it,\" said Haidée. \"The noise increased; steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer: they were descending the steps leading to the cavern. Selim made ready his lance. Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat. \u0027Who are you?\u0027 cried Selim. \u0027But whoever you may be, I charge you not to advance another step.\u0027--\u0027Long live the emperor!\u0027 said the figure. \u0027He grants a full pardon to the Vizier Ali, and not only gives him his life, but restores to him his fortune and his possessions.\u0027 My mother uttered a cry of joy, and clasped me to her bosom. \u0027Stop,\u0027 said Selim, seeing that she was about to go out; you see I have not yet received the ring,\u0027--\u0027True,\u0027 said my mother. And she fell on her knees, at the same time holding me up towards heaven, as if she desired, while praying to God in my behalf, to raise me actually to his presence.\" And for the second time Haidée stopped, overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow, and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance, so parched and dry were her throat and lips. Monte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and presented it to her, saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command,--\"Courage.\" Haidée dried her eyes, and continued: \"By this time our eyes, habituated to the darkness, had recognized the messenger of the pasha,--it was a friend. Selim had also recognized him, but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty, which was to obey. \u0027In whose name do you come?\u0027 said he to him. \u0027I come in the name of our master, Ali Tepelini.\u0027--\u0027If you come from Ali himself,\u0027 said Selim, \u0027you know what you were charged to remit to me?\u0027--\u0027Yes,\u0027 said the messenger, \u0027and I bring you his ring.\u0027 At these words he raised his hand above his head, to show the token; but it was too far off, and there was not light enough to enable Selim, where he was standing, to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view. \u0027I do not see what you have in your hand,\u0027 said Selim. \u0027Approach then,\u0027 said the messenger, \u0027or I will come nearer to you, if you prefer it.\u0027--\u0027I will agree to neither one nor the other,\u0027 replied the young soldier; \u0027place the object which I desire to see in the ray of light which shines there, and retire while I examine it.\u0027--\u0027Be it so,\u0027 said the envoy; and he retired, after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by Selim. \"Oh, how our hearts palpitated; for it did, indeed, seem to be a ring which was placed there. But was it my father\u0027s ring? that was the question. Selim, still holding in his hand the lighted match, walked towards the opening in the cavern, and, aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave, picked up the token. \"\u0027It is well,\u0027 said he, kissing it; \u0027it is my master\u0027s ring!\u0027 And throwing the match on the ground, he trampled on it and extinguished it. The messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands. At this signal four soldiers of the Serasker Koorshid suddenly appeared, and Selim fell, pierced by five blows. Each man had stabbed him separately, and, intoxicated by their crime, though still pale with fear, they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire, after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold. At this moment my mother seized me in her arms, and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves, she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk, where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion. The lower rooms were entirely filled with Koorshid\u0027s troops; that is to say, with our enemies. Just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door, we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone. My mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards; I luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within. \u0027What do you want?\u0027 said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold. \u0027What we want,\u0027 replied one, \u0027is to communicate to you the will of his highness. Do you see this firman?\u0027--\u0027I do,\u0027 said my father. \u0027Well, read it; he demands your head.\u0027 \"My father answered with a loud laugh, which was more frightful than even threats would have been, and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard; he had fired them himself, and had killed two men. The Palikares, who were prostrated at my father\u0027s feet, now sprang up and fired, and the room was filled with fire and smoke. At the same instant the firing began on the other side, and the balls penetrated the boards all round us. Oh, how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment, in the midst of the flying bullets, his scimitar in his hand, and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies! and how he terrified them, even then, and made them fly before him! \u0027Selim, Selim!\u0027 cried he, \u0027guardian of the fire, do your duty!\u0027--\u0027Selim is dead,\u0027 replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth, \u0027and you are lost, Ali!\u0027 At the same moment an explosion was heard, and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms--the troops were firing from underneath. Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds. \"My father howled aloud, plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made, and tore up one of the planks entire. But immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired, and the flame, rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano, soon reached the tapestry, which it quickly devoured. In the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries, two reports, fearfully distinct, followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all, froze me with terror. These two shots had mortally wounded my father, and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries. However, he remained standing, clinging to a window. My mother tried to force the door, that she might go and die with him, but it was fastened on the inside. All around him were lying the Palikares, writhing in convulsive agonies, while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows. At this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way. my father fell on one knee, and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth, armed with sabres, pistols, and poniards--twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man, and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons, and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet. I felt myself fall to the ground, my mother had fainted.\" Haidée\u0027s arms fell by her side, and she uttered a deep groan, at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands. Monte Cristo arose and approached her, took her hand, and said to her in Romaic, \"Calm yourself, my dear child, and take courage in remembering that there is a God who will punish traitors.\" \"It is a frightful story, count,\" said Albert, terrified at the paleness of Haidée\u0027s countenance, \"and I reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request.\" \"Oh, it is nothing,\" said Monte Cristo. Then, patting the young girl on the head, he continued, \"Haidée is very courageous, and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes.\" \"Because, my lord.\" said Haidée eagerly, \"my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness.\" Albert looked at her with curiosity, for she had not yet related what he most desired to know,--how she had become the slave of the count. Haidée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors; she exclaimed, \u0027When my mother recovered her senses we were before the serasker. \u0027Kill,\u0027 said she, \u0027but spare the honor of the widow of Ali.\u0027--\u0027It is not to me to whom you must address yourself,\u0027 said Koorshid. \"\u0027To whom, then?\u0027--\u0027To your new master.\u0027 \"\u0027Who and where is he?\u0027--\u0027He is here.\u0027 \"And Koorshid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father,\" said Haidée, in a tone of chastened anger. \"Then,\" said Albert, \"you became the property of this man?\" \"No,\" replied Haidée, \"he did not dare to keep us, so we were sold to some slave-merchants who were going to Constantinople. We traversed Greece, and arrived half dead at the imperial gates. They were surrounded by a crowd of people, who opened a way for us to pass, when suddenly my mother, having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention, uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground, pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates, and beneath which were inscribed these words: 　 \u0027THIS IS THE HEAD OF ALI TEPELINI, PASHA OF YANINA.\u0027 I cried bitterly, and tried to raise my mother from the earth, but she was dead! I was taken to the slave-market, and was purchased by a rich Armenian. He caused me to be instructed, gave me masters, and when I was thirteen years of age he sold me to the Sultan Mahmood.\" \"Of whom I bought her,\" said Monte Cristo, \"as I told you, Albert, with the emerald which formed a match to the one I had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills.\" 伯爵的马刚驶到街道的拐角上，阿尔贝突然转身向伯爵放声大笑起来——的确，他笑得声音如此之大，好象是故意做作出来的。“喂！”他说，“叫查理九世［查理九世（一五五○—一五七四），法国国王，一五七二年以圣·巴索罗谬日，即八月二十四日。对新教徒进行大屠杀。——译注］在圣·巴索罗谬日进行大屠杀以后，曾向凯塞琳·梅迪契问过一句话，我现在也要用那句话来问问您：‘我那个小角色扮演得怎么样？’” “您指的是哪件事？”基督山问。 “指在腾格拉尔先生家里对付我那位对手的样子。” “嘿，问得太好了！什么对手？咦，您的被保护人安德烈·卡瓦尔康蒂先生呀。” “啊！请您别开玩笑，子爵，安德烈先生并不归我保护。起码，在他和腾格拉尔先生的关系上没有这种情况。” “如果那个青年人真的在这个方面要您帮助的时候，您不帮他，就得让他怨了。可所幸对手是我，他可以不必作那种请求。” “什么！您认为他在准备求婚吗？” “这一点我可以肯定，他对腾格拉尔小姐讲话时那种情意浓浓的眼光和矫揉造作的语气完全暴露了他的心意。他显然想向那骄傲的欧热妮求婚。” “那又有什么了不起的，只要他们喜欢您。” “可事实并非如此，我亲爱的伯爵，刚好相反，我是前后遭夹击。” “前后遭夹击？” “没错，欧热妮小姐难得和我搭个腔，而她的密友亚密莱小姐就根本不跟我说话。” “可她的父亲非常敬重您。”基督山说。 “他！噢，不！他在我的心头上扎了不知多少刀——我承认那不过是演悲剧时所用的武器，它不会刺伤人，刀尖会缩回到刀柄里去，可他却相信那是能致人命的真家伙呢。” “妒忌就是爱情。” “不错，可我并不妒忌。” “他恰恰在妒忌。” “妒忌谁——妒忌德布雷吗？” “不，妒忌您。” “妒忌我？我们可以打个赌，用不了一个星期，我就要被拒之门外了。” “您错了，我亲爱的子爵。” “请证明。” “您希望我给您证明吗？” “是的。” “好！我现在受托要竭力设法使马尔塞夫伯爵去和男爵把事情确定地安排一下。” “谁委托您的。” “男爵本人。” “噢！”阿尔贝极尽谄谀地说，“您当然不愿意干这种差使了，我亲爱的伯爵？” “我当然要干，阿尔贝，因为我已经答应了。” “唉！”阿尔贝叹了口气说，“看来您是下决心要我结婚了。” “我下决心要设法不论在什么事情上都和每一个人保持友好的关系，”基督山说。“但说到德布雷，我最近怎么没有在男爵的家里看到他呢？” “吵了一次架。” “什么，跟男爵夫人？” “不，跟男爵。” “难道他觉察到什么了吗？” “啊！这句话问得倒挺幽默！” “您以为他起了疑心吗？”基督山很天真地问。 “您是从哪儿来的，我亲爱的伯爵？”阿尔贝说。 “从刚果来的，如果您想问这个问题的话。” “一定比刚果还要远得多。” “可我怎么知道巴黎人做丈夫的作风呢？” “噢，我亲爱的伯爵，天下的丈夫大概处处都是一样，不管哪个国家的丈夫都可以作全人类的好标本。” “那么腾格拉尔和德布雷之间有什么可争吵的呢？他们好象很能互相了解。”基督山用同样的天真口气说。 “啊！您现在想来打听阿塞丝的秘仪［阿塞丝是埃及神话里的蕃殖女神，参加女神的秘仪，据说可以窥测人们的隐私并预知未来，但只有忠实的信徒才能参加此种秘仪。——译注］了，可惜我不是当事人。安德烈·卡瓦尔康蒂先生成为那一家的一名成员的时候，您可以拿这个问题去问他。” 马车停住了。“我们到了，”基督山说。“现在才十点半，进去坐坐吧。” “十分愿意。” “我的马车可以送您回去。” “不，谢谢您，我吩咐叫我的车子跟着来的。” “哦，到了，”基督山一面说，一面从马车里出来。他们进了屋。客厅里已烛台高照；他们走进去。“给我们煮些茶来，巴浦斯汀。”伯爵说，巴浦斯汀不等客人回答，转身就走，两秒钟之内，他又回来了，手里捧着一只放得整整齐齐的茶盘，象是我们在童话里读到的从地底下蹦出来的食物一样。 “真的，我亲爱的伯爵，”马尔塞夫说，“我崇拜您的倒不是您有钱——因为也许有人比您更加富有，也不仅是您的智慧——因为博马舍也许跟您差不多——而是在于您的仆人服侍您的那种方式，不用多说话，一会儿，甚至一秒钟，立刻可以办到。好象在您拉铃的时候，他们就已经猜到您想要什么了，而且凡是您可能想要的东西，都随时准备妥当了似的。” “您这段话也许是真的，他们知道我的习惯。譬如说，我举个例子给您，您在喝茶的时候喜欢干什么？” “嗯，我非常喜欢抽烟。” 基督山在铜锣上敲了一下。没出一秒钟，一扇暗门打开了，阿里拿着两支长烟筒进来、烟筒上已装好了上等的土耳其烟丝。 “真是神了！”阿尔贝说。 “噢，没什么，这其实非常简单，”基督山回答。“阿里知道我平常在喝茶或喝咖啡的时候总要抽烟，他知道我吩咐备茶，他也知道我带您一起回家。我招呼他的时候，他知道我为什么要招呼他，而且由于他的国家都用烟筒待客，所以他拿了两支长烟筒来而不是只拿一支。” “您的解释当然很在理，不过确实也只有您——啊！那是什么声音呀！”马尔塞夫于是把他的头歪向门口，里面传出一种吉他般的声音。 “说实话，我亲爱的子爵，您今天晚上是命中注定是要听音乐的，您刚才从腾格拉尔小姐的钢琴那儿逃开，又遭到海黛的月琴的攻击。” “海黛！好可爱的一个名字！那么，除了在拜伦的诗里以外，世界上真有女人叫海黛这个名字的吗？” “当然有。海黛这个名字在法国很不多见，但在阿尔巴尼亚和伊皮鲁斯却普通得很。这种名字就象你们称为纯洁·谦恭·天真·腾格拉尔小姐，那么印在结婚请帖上该有多好呀！” “轻点儿，”伯爵说，“别这么大声，海黛也许会听到的。” “您觉着她会不高兴吗？” “不，当然不。”伯爵以一种倨傲的表情说。 “那么，她为人非常和善了，是不是？”阿尔贝说。 “那不叫和善，而是她的本分，一个奴隶不能拂逆她的主人。” “喏，您现在自己又开起玩笑来了。现在还有奴隶吗？” “当然喽，因为海黛就是我的奴隶。” “真的，伯爵，您的所作所为都跟别人不一样。基督山伯爵阁下的奴隶！咦，这在法国倒是一种爵位了。据您花钱的标准来算，这个职位起码得值十万艾居一年。” “十万艾居！那个可怜的姑娘本来不止那个价钱。她出生在珠宝堆，《一千零一夜》里记载的那些财宝和她所拥有的一比，就显得微乎其微了。” “那么她一定是一位公主了？” “您猜对了，而且是她祖国最显赫的公主之一。” “我原也这么想。可这么显赫的一位公主怎么会变成一个奴隶呢？” “达翁苏斯［古代叙拉古的达翁苏斯王之子，失位后，流亡于可林斯，成为该地的学校教师。——译注］这个暴君怎么会变成一个小学教师呢？那是战神的安排，我亲爱的子爵——是造化捉弄人的结果。” “她的姓名是需要保密吗？” “对别人要保密，对您却用不着，我亲爱的子爵，您是我的朋友，您不会张扬出去——您愿不愿意？——如果您答应不张扬出去——” “噢！我用人格担保。” “您知道亚尼纳总督的身世吗？” “阿里·铁贝林吗？当然喽，家父就是在他手下服役的时候起家的呀。” “不错，我倒忘记那回事了。” “嗯！海黛是阿里·铁贝林的什么人？” “就是他的女儿。” “什么？阿里总督的女儿？” “阿坦克总督和美人凡瑟丽姬的女儿。” “给您作奴隶？” “是的，当然是的。” “但她怎么会落得这个样子呢？” “嗯，有一天我经过君士坦丁堡市场把她买下来的。” “真神了！我亲爱的伯爵，谁跟您在一起，谁就不是在生活而是在做梦了。现在，我也许可以提出一个轻率莽撞的要求，但是——” “请说。” “但是既然您和海黛一起外出过，有几次甚至带她上过戏院——” “怎么？” “我想我也许可以冒昧地请您赏我个脸。” “您什么都可以向我要求。” “好，那么，我亲爱的伯爵，介绍我见见您的公主好吗？” “可以照办。但有两个条件。” “我马上接受。” “第一是您绝不能告诉任何人说我允许过您和她会面。” “好极了，”阿尔贝举起一只手说，“我发誓绝不告诉人。” “第二是您绝不能告诉她，说令尊曾经在她父亲手下服役过。” “这一点我也可以发誓。” “这就行了，子爵，您会记住这两个誓言的，对不对？我知道您是一个很讲信用的人。” 伯爵又敲了一下铜锣。阿里又进来了。“告诉海黛，”他说，“我马上就去和她一起喝咖啡，告诉她，我希望她允许我介绍我的一位朋友和她见面。”阿里鞠躬退出。 “现在，请小心，”伯爵说，“提问题别太直接，我亲爱的马尔塞夫。如果您想知道什么事情，告诉我，我去问她。” “行。” 阿里第三次进屋，掀开那张掩着门的幕，向他的主人和阿尔贝示意他们可以进去。 “我们进去吧。”基督山说。 阿尔贝用手理了理他的头发，卷卷他的胡子，对自己的仪表觉着满意了之后，就跟着伯爵走进那个房间；伯爵则在进屋前已重新戴上他的帽子和手套。阿里象一个前卫似的驻守在门外；门口由三个法国侍女在梅多的指挥下把守着。海黛在她那一套房间的第一个屋子里等候她的客人，这是她的客厅。她的大眼睛睁得圆圆的，露出冷静和期待的神情，因为除了基督山以外，这是她第一次跟男人见面。她坐在房间一隅的一张沙发上，按照东方人的习惯，交叉着两腿，舒舒服服地象一只小鸟躺在窠里一样，这窠用的是东方最华贵的镶花绸缎搭构成的。她的身边放着那只她刚才抚弄过的乐器；那种仪态，以及那种环境，让她显得可爱非常。一见到基督山，她就站起身来，用她所特有的那种爱和顺从的微笑迎接他。基督山朝她走过去，伸出一只手，她把那只手捧到她的嘴上。 阿尔贝仍然站在门口，被那种罕见的美迷住了，这是他平生第一次看到这样的美，在法国，这种美是无法想象的。 “您带来的是什么人？”那位年轻女郎用现代希腊语问基督山，“是兄弟，朋友，生疏的相识，还是仇敌？” “一位朋友。”基督山也用相同语言说。 “他叫什么名字？” “阿尔贝子爵。就是我在罗马从强盗手里救出来的那个人。” “您想让我用哪一种语言和他说话？” 基督山转向阿尔贝。“您懂现代希腊语吗？”他问。 “唉！不懂，”阿尔贝说，“古代希腊语也不懂，我亲爱的伯爵。荷马和柏拉图的学生之中，再也找不到比我更懒惰，甚至都可以说更可鄙的了。” “那么，”海黛说，她说这话显然她很明白基督山和阿尔贝之间在说什么——“那么我说法语或意大利语吧，如果老爷不反对的话。” 基督山想了一想。“你说意大利语吧，”他说。然后，又转身对阿尔贝说“可惜您不懂古代或现代希腊语，这两种语言海黛都讲得非常流利。这个可怜的孩子不得不用意大利话和您交谈了，这大概会让您对她产生一种错觉。”伯爵向海黛作了一个示意“阁下，”她对马尔塞夫说，“您既然是我主人的朋友，当然对您再欢迎不过了。”这句话是用典型的托斯卡纳土语说出的，而且带着那种柔和的罗马口音，令但丁的语言听起来跟荷马的语言一样明快悦耳。然后，她又转向阿里，吩咐他把咖啡和烟筒拿来；在阿里离开房间去执行他的年轻主妇吩咐的时候，她示意请阿尔贝走近一些。基督山和马尔塞夫把他们的椅子拖到一张小茶几前面，茶几上放着曲谱、图画和花瓶。这时阿里拿着咖啡和长烟筒进来了；至于巴浦斯汀先生，这个地方是禁止他进来的。阿尔贝不肯接受那个黑奴递给他的那支烟筒。 “噢，接着吧，接着吧！”伯爵说。“海黛差不多也跟巴黎人一样文明，她讨厌雪茄的气味，而东方的烟草是一种香料，您知道。” 阿里退出房间。咖啡杯都已备好，而且还有一只灰缸，是为阿尔贝特设的。基督山和海黛便按照阿拉伯人的方式喝起阿拉伯饮料，也就是不加糖。海黛用她那纤纤细手端起瓷杯，带着天真的愉快举到她的嘴边，象个小孩子吃到喝到某种她喜欢的东西似的。这时两个女人每人端着一只茶盘进来，茶盘里放着冰块和果子露，他们把茶盘放在两只特制的小桌子上。 “我亲爱的主人，还有您，夫人，”阿尔贝用意大利语说，请别见怪我这副傻头傻脑的样子。我简直是糊涂了。我身处巴黎市中心，就在刚才，我还听到公共马车的哗哗声和卖柠檬水的小贩铃铛的响声，可这会儿我觉得我如同突然被送到了东方——并不是我见到过的东方，而是我在梦中想象出来的东方。噢，夫人，如果我能说希腊语，那么您的谈话，加上我身边这种仙境般的环境，就可以让我度过终生永不忘记的一夜了。” “我可以用意大利语和您谈话，阁下，”海黛平静地说，“如果您喜欢东方，我可以尽量让您在这儿找到东方的气息。” “我跟她谈些什么呢？”阿尔贝小声对基督山说。 “随便什么都行。您可以跟她谈她的祖国和她幼时的回忆，或者，如果您愿意的话，也可以谈谈罗马、那不勒斯或佛罗伦萨。” “噢！”阿尔贝说，“跟一个希腊人谈巴黎人的话题未免太没意思了，我还是跟她谈谈东方的情况吧。” “那么请谈吧，您要谈的这个话题，最合她的口味不过了。” 阿尔贝转向海黛。“您几岁的时候离开希腊的，夫人？”他问。 “我离开希腊的时候只有五岁。”海黛回答。 “您还有点关于您的祖国的记忆吗？” “在我闭上眼睛冥想的时候，我仿佛又看到了那一切，灵魂跟肉体一样也有它的视觉器官；肉眼看到的东西有时会遗忘，而灵魂见过的东西则是永远牢记的。” “您对于往事的回忆能追溯到多久呢？” “我刚能走路的时候，我的母亲——她的名字叫凡瑟丽姬，那就是‘忠贞’的意思，”这位年轻女郎自豪地昂起头说——“我的母亲，携着我的手，先把我们所有的钱都倒进钱袋里，戴上面纱，然后出去为囚犯募捐，一路走，一路说，‘谁施舍钱给穷人，就等于还债给主，’在我们的钱袋装满的时候，我们就回到宫里，对我父亲只字不提，派人送到修道院，发放给囚犯。” “您那时候几岁？” “我那时三岁。”海黛说。 “那么您在三岁的时候，就把当时那么多事情记住了吗？” 阿尔贝说。 “都记得。” “伯爵，”阿尔贝小声对基督山说，“请允许夫人把她的身世给我讲一些听，您不许我向她提起家父的名字，可也许她在追忆往事的过程中，会不自觉地提到他，如果我们的姓能从两片这么美丽的嘴唇里说出来，您绝对想象不到我会多么的高兴。” 基督山转向海黛，脸上以一种提醒她格外小心的表情，用希腊语说：“把你父亲的遭遇告诉我们，但不要说出那个出卖你们的人的名字，也不要讲他出卖你们的经过。” “您在跟她说什么？”马尔塞夫小声说。 “我又提醒了她一次，说您是一位朋友，","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/72/3995.html","bookId":545,"book":{"id":545,"title":"The Count of Monte Cristo基督山伯爵","description":"简介：
