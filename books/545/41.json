{"id":43909,"no":41,"title":"Chapter 45 The Rain of Blood","content":"\"AS THE JEWELLER returned to the apartment, he cast around him a scrutinizing glance--but there was nothing to excite suspicion, if it did not exist, or to confirm it, if it were already awakened. Caderousse\u0027s hands still grasped the gold and bank-notes, and La Carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest. \u0027Well, well,\u0027 said the jeweller, \u0027you seem, my good friends, to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money, by counting it over so carefully directly I was gone.\u0027--\u0027Oh, no,\u0027 answered Caderousse, \u0027that was not my reason, I can assure you; but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected, as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune, and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream.\u0027 The jeweller smiled.--\u0027Have you any other guests in your house?\u0027 inquired he.--\u0027Nobody but ourselves,\u0027 replied Caderousse; \u0027the fact is, we do not lodge travellers--indeed, our tavern is so near the town, that nobody would think of stopping here.--\u0027Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you.\u0027--\u0027Inconvenience us? Not at all, my dear sir,\u0027 said La Carconte in her most gracious manner. \u0027Not at all, I assure you.\u0027--\u0027But where will you manage to stow me?\u0027--\u0027In the chamber overhead.\u0027--\u0027Surely that is where you yourselves sleep?\u0027--\u0027Never mind that; we have a second bed in the adjoining room.\u0027 Caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment. \n \"The jeweller, meanwhile, was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire La Carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest; and this done, she next occupied herself in arranging his supper, by spreading a napkin at the end of the table, and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner, to which she added three or four fresh-laid eggs. Caderousse had once more parted with his treasure--the banknotes were replaced in the pocket-book, the gold put back into the bag, and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard. He then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air, glancing from time to time at the jeweller, who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes, and merely changing his place on the warm hearth, to enable the whole of his garments to be dried. \n \"\u0027There,\u0027 said La Carconte, as she placed a bottle of wine on the table, \u0027supper is ready whenever you are.\u0027--\u0027And you?\u0027 asked Joannes.--\u0027I don\u0027t want any supper,\u0027 said Caderousse.--\u0027We dined so very late,\u0027 hastily interposed La Carconte.--\u0027Then it seems I am to eat alone,\u0027 remarked the jeweller.--\u0027Oh, we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you,\u0027 answered La Carconte, with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took. \n \"From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen, searching glances, but rapid as the lightning flash. The storm still continued. \u0027There, there,\u0027 said La Carconte; \u0027do you hear that? upon my word, you did well to come back.\u0027--\u0027Nevertheless,\u0027 replied the jeweller, \u0027if by the time I have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated, I shall make another start.\u0027--\u0027It\u0027s the mistral,\u0027 said Caderousse, \u0027and it will be sure to last till to-morrow morning.\u0027 He sighed heavily.--\u0027Well,\u0027 said the jeweller, as he placed himself at table, \u0027all I can say is, so much the worse for those who are abroad.\u0027--\u0027Yes,\u0027 chimed in La Carconte, \u0027they will have a wretched night of it.\u0027 \n \"The jeweller began eating his supper, and the woman, who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her, was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess. Had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her, so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind, or at least have greatly astonished him. Caderousse, meanwhile, continued to pace the room in gloomy silence, sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest; but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast, the agitated inn-keeper went eagerly to the door and opened it. \u0027I believe the storm is over,\u0027 said he. But as if to contradict his statement, at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation, while a sudden gust of wind, mingled with rain, extinguished the lamp he held in his hand. Trembling and awe-struck, Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest, while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth. \u0027You must be tired,\u0027 said she to the jeweller; \u0027I have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed; go up when you are ready, and sleep well.\u0027 \n \"Joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury, but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that, instead of diminishing, the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased; resigning himself, therefore, to what seemed inevitable, he bade his host good-night, and mounted the stairs. He passed over my head and I heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps. The quick, eager glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended, while Caderousse, on the contrary, turned his back, and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him. \n \"All these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done; in fact, all that had happened (with the exception of the story of the diamond, which certainly did wear an air of improbability), appeared natural enough, and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust; but, worn out as I was with fatigue, and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated, I determined to obtain a few hours\u0027 sleep. Overhead I could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller, who, after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night, threw himself on his bed, and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight. Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having no suspicion of anything wrong, I sought not to shake it off. I looked into the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs; his back was turned towards me, so that I could not see the expression of his countenance--neither should I have been able to do so had he been placed differently, as his head was buried between his two hands. La Carconte continued to gaze on him for some time, then shrugging her shoulders, she took her seat immediately opposite to him. At this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near, and a bright light flashed over the room. La Carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband, but as he made no sign of changing his position, she extended her hard, bony hand, and touched him on the forehead. \n \"Caderousse shuddered. The woman\u0027s lips seemed to move, as though she were talking; but because she merely spoke in an undertone, or my senses were dulled by sleep, I did not catch a word she uttered. Confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually I fell into a deep, heavy slumber. How long I had been in this unconscious state I know not, when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol, followed by a fearful cry. Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me, and the next instant a dull, heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase. I had not yet fully recovered consciousness, when again I heard groans, mingled with half-stifled cries, as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle. A cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy. Hastily raising myself on one arm, I looked around, but all was dark; and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above, for some kind of moisture appeared to fall, drop by drop, upon my forehead, and when I passed my hand across my brow, I felt that it was wet and clammy. \n \"To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silence--unbroken, save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above. The staircase creaked, he descended into the room below, approached the fire and lit a candle. The man was Caderousse--he was pale and his shirt was all blood. Having obtained the light, he hurried up-stairs again, and once more I heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps. A moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the small shagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained the diamond,--seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in, then, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he deposited it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round his head. After this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold he had put there, thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers, and the other into that of his waistcoat, hastily tied up a small bundle of linen, and rushing towards the door, disappeared in the darkness of the night. \n \"Then all became clear and manifest to me, and I reproached myself with what had happened, as though I myself had done the guilty deed. I fancied that I still heard faint moans, and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead, I determined to go to his relief, by way of atoning in some slight degree, not for the crime I had committed, but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent. For this purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining room. The poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts, and I found myself in the house. Hastily snatching up the lighted candle, I hurried to the staircase; about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs. It was that of La Carconte. The pistol I had heard had doubtless been fired at her. The shot had frightfully lacerated her throat, leaving two gaping wounds from which, as well as the mouth, the blood was pouring in floods. She was stone dead. I strode past her, and ascended to the sleeping chamber, which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder. The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there, and the sheets, to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung, were dragged across the room. The murdered man lay on the floor, his head leaning against the wall, and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast; there was a fourth gash, in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle. \n \"I stumbled over some object; I stooped to examine--it was the second pistol, which had not gone off, probably from the powder being wet. I approached the jeweller, who was not quite dead, and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor, he opened his eyes, fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze, moved his lips as though trying to speak, then, overcome by the effort, fell back and expired. This appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses, and finding that I could no longer be of service to any one in the house, my only desire was to fly. I rushed towards the staircase, clutching my hair, and uttering a groan of horror. Upon reaching the room below, I found five or six custom-house officers, and two or three gendarmes--all heavily armed. They threw themselves upon me. I made no resistance; I was no longer master of my senses. When I strove to speak, a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips. \n \"As I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood-stained garments, I involuntarily surveyed myself, and then I discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as I lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte. I pointed to the spot where I had concealed myself. \u0027What does he mean?\u0027 asked a gendarme. One of the officers went to the place I directed. \u0027He means,\u0027 replied the man upon his return, \u0027that he got in that way;\u0027 and he showed the hole I had made when I broke through. \n \"Then I saw that they took me for the assassin. I recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me, while I managed to stammer forth--\u0027I did not do it! Indeed, indeed I did not!\u0027 A couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast.--\u0027Stir but a step,\u0027 said they, \u0027and you are a dead man.\u0027--\u0027Why should you threaten me with death,\u0027 cried I, \u0027when I have already declared my innocence?\u0027--\u0027Tush, tush,\u0027 cried the men; \u0027keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at N?mes. Meanwhile, come along with us; and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly.\u0027 Alas, resistance was far from my thoughts. I was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse\u0027s tail, and thus they took me to N?mes. \n \"I had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near the tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he had returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of beseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the Abbé Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of the Pont du Gard on that morning. If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond, and there existed no such person as the Abbé Busoni, then, indeed, I was lost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung upon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth. Two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part, while I must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he would. Caderousse still evaded all pursuit, and I had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate. My trial was to come on at the approaching assizes; when, on the 8th of September--that is to say, precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life--the Abbé Busoni, whom I never ventured to believe I should see, presented himself at the prison doors, saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him; he added, that having learned at Marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment, he hastened to comply with my desire. You may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him, and how minutely I related the whole of what I had seen and heard. I felt some degree of nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond, but, to my inexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every particular, and to my equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief in all I said. And then it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country, and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind, I besought him to receive my confession, under the seal of which I recounted the Auteuil affair in all its details, as well as every other transaction of my life. That which I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation. My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil proved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused. When he quitted me, he bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence. \n \"I had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf, for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held. In the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of Caderousse, who was discovered in some distant country, and brought back to France, where he made a full confession, refusing to make the fact of his wife\u0027s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt. The wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life, and I was immediately set at liberty.\" \n \"And then it was, I presume,\" said Monte Cristo \"that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the Abbé Busoni?\" \n \"It was, your excellency; the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me. \n \"\u0027Your mode of life as a smuggler,\u0027 said he to me one day, \u0027will be the ruin of you; if you get out, don\u0027t take it up again.\u0027--\u0027But how,\u0027 inquired I, \u0027am I to maintain myself and my poor sister?\u0027 \n \"\u0027A person, whose confessor I am,\u0027 replied he, \u0027and who entertains a high regard for me, applied to me a short time since to procure him a confidential servant. Would you like such a post? If so, I will give you a letter of introduction to him.\u0027--\u0027Oh, father,\u0027 I exclaimed, \u0027you are very good.\u0027 \n \"\u0027But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason to repent my recommendation.\u0027 I extended my hand, and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate, but he stopped me. \u0027It is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow,\u0027 said he; \u0027I know and admire the Corsican nature too well to fear you. Here, take this,\u0027 continued he, after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to your excellency, and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service, and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so?\" \n \"No,\" replied the count; \"I take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully, Bertuccio; but you might have shown more confidence in me.\" \n \"I, your excellency?\" \n \"Yes; you. How comes it, that having both a sister and an adopted son, you have never spoken to me of either?\" \n \"Alas, I have still to recount the most distressing period of my life. Anxious as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear sister, I lost no time in hastening to Corsica, but when I arrived at Rogliano I found a house of mourning, the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day. Acting by my advice, my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of Benedetto, who was continually tormenting her for money, as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession. One morning that he had demanded money, threatening her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired, he disappeared and remained away all day, leaving the kind-hearted Assunta, who loved him as if he were her own child, to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence. Evening came, and still, with all the patient solicitude of a mother, she watched for his return. \n \"As the eleventh hour struck, he entered with a swaggering air, attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions. She stretched out her arms to him, but they seized hold of her, and one of the three--none other than the accursed Benedetto exclaimed,--\u0027Put her to torture and she\u0027ll soon tell us where her money is.\u0027 \n \"It unfortunately happened that our neighbor, Vasilio, was at Bastia, leaving no person in his house but his wife; no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling. Two held poor Assunta, who, unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her, smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners. The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows, then returned, and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations, and then dragged Assunta feet foremost towards the brazier, expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted. In the struggle her clothes caught fire, and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate. Covered with flames, Assunta rushed wildly to the door, but it was fastened; she flew to the windows, but they were also secured; then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks; it was Assunta calling for help. The cries died away in groans, and next morning, as soon as Vasilio\u0027s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad, she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities, when Assunta, although dreadfully burnt, was found still breathing; every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open, and the money stolen. Benedetto never again appeared at Rogliano, neither have I since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him. \n \"It was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on your excellency, to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned Benedetto, since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my sister, since she was dead.\" \n \"And in what light did you view the occurrence?\" inquired Monte Cristo. \n \"As a punishment for the crime I had committed,\" answered Bertuccio. \"Oh, those Villeforts are an accursed race!\" \n \"Truly they are,\" murmured the count in a lugubrious tone. \n \"And now,\" resumed Bertuccio, \"your excellency may, perhaps, be able to comprehend that this place, which I revisit for the first time--this garden, the actual scene of my crime--must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature, and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency, who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause. At this instant a shudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now standing on the very grave in which lies M. de Villefort, by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child.\" \n \"Everything is possible,\" said Monte Cristo, rising from the bench on which he had been sitting; \"even,\" he added in an inaudible voice, \"even that the procureur be not dead. The Abbé Busoni did right to send you to me,\" he went on in his ordinary tone, \"and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history, as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future. As for that Benedetto, who so grossly belied his name, have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone, or what has become of him?\" \n \"No; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, I should shun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast. Thank God, I have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and believe he is dead.\" \n \"Do not think so, Bertuccio,\" replied the count; \"for the wicked are not so easily disposed of, for God seems to have them under his special watch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance.\" \n \"So be it,\" responded Bertuccio, \"all I ask of heaven is that I may never see him again. And now, your excellency,\" he added, bowing his head, \"you know everything--you are my judge on earth, as the Almighty is in heaven; have you for me no words of consolation?\" \n \"My good friend, I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the Abbé Busoni. Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you, and, perhaps, to others. Benedetto, if still living, will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly punished in his turn. As far as you yourself are concerned, I see but one point in which you are really guilty. Ask yourself, wherefore, after rescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it to its mother? There was the crime, Bertuccio--that was where you became really culpable.\" \n \"True, excellency, that was the crime, the real crime, for in that I acted like a coward. My first duty, directly I had succeeded in recalling the babe to life, was to restore it to its mother; but, in order to do so, I must have made close and careful inquiry, which would, in all probability, have led to my own apprehension; and I clung to life, partly on my sister\u0027s account, and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance. Perhaps, too, the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own. And then, again, I am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother.\" Bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words, while Monte Cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning. After a brief silence, rendered still more solemn by the time and place, the count said, in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner, \"In order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination (the last we shall ever hold upon this subject), I will repeat to you some words I have heard from the lips of the Abbé Busoni. For all evils there are two remedies--time and silence. And now leave me, Monsieur Bertuccio, to walk alone here in the garden. The very circumstances which inflict on you, as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here, such painful emotions, are to me, on the contrary, a source of something like contentment, and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation. The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs, while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade. Here I have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination, and furnished with thickly grown trees, beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will. This to me, who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall, is, I assure you, a most agreeable surprise. I have no fear of ghosts, and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day. Retire within, Bertuccio, and tranquillize your mind. Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the Abbé Busoni, send for me, if I am still on earth, and I will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity.\" \n Bertuccio bowed respectfully, and turned away, sighing heavily. Monte Cristo, left alone, took three or four steps onwards, and murmured, \"Here, beneath this plane-tree, must have been where the infant\u0027s grave was dug. There is the little door opening into the garden. At this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment. There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars, for there, before my eyes, beneath my feet, all around me, I have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth.\" After making the tour of the garden a second time, the count re-entered his carriage, while Bertuccio, who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master\u0027s features, took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word. The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris. \n That same evening, upon reaching his abode in the Champs Elysées, the Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner. Nor, although preceding the party, did he once mistake one door for another, or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit. Ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey. Having given various orders to Bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house, the Count, drawing out his watch, said to the attentive Nubian, \"It is half-past eleven o\u0027clock; Haidée will soon he here. Have the French attendants been summoned to await her coming?\" Ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair Greek, which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance, that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence. Ali, having pointed to the apartments, held up three fingers of his right hand, and then, placing it beneath his head, shut his eyes, and feigned to sleep. \"I understand,\" said Monte Cristo, well acquainted with Ali\u0027s pantomime; \"you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping-chamber.\" Ali, with considerable animation, made a sign in the affirmative. \n “当珠宝商回到房间里来的时候，他小心地向四周环顾了一下，但房间里没什么可疑之处，即使他这时心里已有所怀疑，这种怀疑也是无法存在的，或无法证实的。卡德鲁斯的两手依旧紧紧地抓着他的金洋和钞票，而卡康脱女人则极力向客人装出一副善意的微笑。‘啊！’珠宝商说，‘你对于钱的数目似乎还有点不放心，我走了以后你又数过了吧。’‘不，不是的，’卡德鲁斯答道，‘只是这笔钱财来得这样突然，我们简直难以相信自己的好运气，所以只有把实实在在的物证放在眼前，我们才能相信自己不是在做梦。’珠宝商微笑了一下。‘你们家还有别的客人吗？’他问道。‘没有，’卡德鲁斯回答道，‘我们这儿不住旅客的，我们离镇子太近了，谁都不会想到要在这儿投宿。’‘那我恐怕会打扰你们了吧？’‘噢，老天爷，不！亲爱的先生，一点儿也不，’卡康脱女人说道，‘一点儿也不，我向你保证。’‘但你们让我睡在哪儿好呢？’‘楼上有房间。’‘可那不是你们的房间吗？’‘放心好了！我们的后房还有一张床。’卡德鲁斯带着惊奇的神情看着他的妻子。”这时，卡康脱女人已生起了壁炉里的火，以便客人把湿衣服烤干，那珠宝商一边背向着火取暖，一边哼着小曲。卡康脱女人还在桌子的一端铺上了一块餐巾，把他们吃剩的晚餐放在了上面，另外又加了三四只新鲜鸡蛋。卡德鲁斯这时已把他的钞票装进了皮夹子，金洋装进了钱袋里，全部财宝都小心地锁进了钱箱里。然后他面带忧郁，心事重重地开始在房间里踱来踱去，时不时地瞟一眼那珠宝商，珠宝商这时仍站在火炉前面，身上直冒热气，烤干了一面，又转身烤另一面。“‘喏，’卡康脱女人拿来一瓶酒放到了桌子上，说道，‘晚餐已经准备好了，随便你什么时候吃好了。’‘你们不和我一起坐下来吃一点吗？’珠宝商问道。‘我今天晚上不吃饭了。’卡德鲁斯说道。‘我们午饭吃得很晚。’卡康脱女人急忙插嘴说。‘那么看来我要一个人吃罗？’珠宝商说道。‘噢，我们可以陪你坐坐。’卡康脱女人回答说，态度非常殷勤，即使对于付钱吃饭的客人，她也是不常表现出这种态度的。”

“卡德鲁斯锐利的目光不时地射向他的妻子，但只象电光一闪那样的短暂。暴风雨依旧咆啸着。‘喏！喏，’卡康脱女人说道，‘你听到了没有？说实话，你真回来对了。’‘可是，’珠宝商答道，‘要是我吃完饭以后暴风雨已经停了，我还是要去尝试一次的，看看能否完成我的旅程。’‘噢，’卡德鲁斯摇摇头说道，‘暴风雨是决不会停的，现在刮的是西北风，肯定要到明天早晨才会停下来，说完他重重地叹了一口气。’‘哎！’那珠宝商一边在桌子前面坐下来，一边说道，‘说来说去那些在船上的人可算倒霉了。’‘啊！’卡康脱女人附和着说道，‘碰到这样恶劣天气的晚上他们可真够苦的了。’“珠宝商开始吃起饭来，卡康脱女人则继续向他献小殷勤，象个小心的主妇一样。她平常是那样的古怪别扭，而这时却变成了一位关心他人的有礼貌的模范家庭主妇了。要是那珠宝商以前曾和她相处过，对于她这样明显的变化一定会表示惊奇的，因而也就一定会产生某种怀疑。这时，卡德鲁斯继续在房间里来回地走着，似乎不愿去看他的客人，当那个外乡人一吃完饭的时候，他就走到门口，把门打开。‘暴风雨好象过去了。’他说道。但似乎上天故意要驳斥他的话似的，就在这时突然打下了一个很响的霹雳，几乎要把房子连根拔起似的，同时突然地刮进来一阵夹带着雨水的狂风，忽地一下扑灭了他手里的那盏灯。卡德鲁斯急忙关上门，又回到了他的客人那里，而卡康脱女人则在壁炉里快要熄灭的炭火上点起了一支蜡烛。‘你一定很累了，’她向珠宝商说道，‘我已经在你的床上铺好了白床单。你去你的卧室休息吧，晚安！’“那珠宝商又等了一会儿，看看那暴风雨有没有平息下去，但他看到的是雷声和雨点都愈来愈大，于是便向两位主人道了晚安，上楼去了。他当时正从我的头顶上经过，他每上一级楼梯，我就听到楼梯格吱地叫一声。卡康脱女人那焦灼的目光跟随着他，而卡德鲁斯却正相反，他甚至连看都不朝那个方向看一眼。 \n “这一切，虽然从那以后一直深深地印在我的脑海里，但当时却并没给我留下多大的印象。的确，所发生的这一切（除了那个有关钻石的故事听起来有点令人难以相信以外）似乎都是很自然的。当时我虽然很疲倦，但心里仍很想等暴风雨一停就继续上路，所以我决定利用这比较安静的时间来睡上几个钟头，以恢复我的体力和精力。那珠宝商的房间就在我的头顶上，他的一举一动我都能辩别出来，他先尽力布置了一番，准备舒舒服服地过一夜，然后就往床上一倒，我听到了床在他的重压之下发出的格吱格吱地响声。我的眼皮在不知不觉中变得沉重起来，我困极了，我当时并没怀疑会出什么事，所以也就不想去摆脱睡意的侵袭了。当我最后一次向房间里张望的时候，卡德鲁斯和他的妻子已经坐了下来，前者坐在一张木头的小矮登上，那种小矮凳在乡下常常是当作椅子用的。他背朝着我，所以我无法看到他脸上的表情，但即使他换个方向坐，我也是看不到的，因为他正把头埋在两手之间。卡康脱女人则带着一种藐视的眼神默默地望了他一会儿，然后她耸了耸肩，过去坐在了他的对面。正当这时，那快熄灭的炉火引着了旁边的一片木头，壁炉里又重新吐出个火苗，于是一片火光一瞬间照亮了房间里的一切。卡康脱女人的目光依旧在她丈夫的身上，由于他毫无改变姿势的样子，她就伸出她那只瘦骨嶙嶙的硬手，在他的前额上点了一下。 \n “卡德鲁斯猛地打了个寒颤。那女人的嘴巴似乎在动，好象在讲话，但不知是因为她讲话的声音太低了，还是因为我的听觉已因浓浓的睡意而变迟钝了，总之她讲的话我一个字也没听清楚。甚至连我所看到的东西也都象隔了一重雾似的，自己也不知道究竟是醒着还是在做梦。最后，我合上了眼睛，失去了知觉。究竟我在这种毫无知觉的状态中睡了多久，自己也不知道，总之，我突然被一声枪声和可怕的惨叫声惊醒了。房间的地板上响起了踉跄的脚步声，接着，楼梯上重重地发出了一个响声，象是有样笨重的东西无力地倒下去似的。我的神志还没有完全清醒时就又听到了呻吟声和半窒息的叫喊声混成了一片，象是有人在进行一场垂死的挣扎。最后的那一声喊叫拖得很长，后来就愈来愈弱，渐渐地变成了呻吟，这一声喊叫一下子把我从迷迷糊糊的昏睡状态中唤醒了。我急忙用一只胳脯撑起身子，环顾周围，但见周围一片漆黑，我感觉到头顶上好象雨水已经渗透了楼上房间的地板，因为有一种潮湿的东西正一滴滴地落在我的前额上，我用手抹了一把，确觉得它湿粘糊糊的。 \n “在那一阵可怕的声响之后，便是一片死一般的沉寂，只剩一个男人在我头顶上走动的声音。楼梯在他的脚下格吱格吱地响着。那个人走到楼下的房间里，走近壁炉前面，点起了一支蜡烛。那是卡德鲁斯，只见他脸色苍白，衬衫被鲜血染成了一片红色。点亮了灯以后，他急急忙忙地又上楼去了，于是我头顶上的房间里又响起了他那急促不安的脚步声。不久，他手里拿着那只鲛皮小盒子下来了，他打开盒子，看清楚了钻石的确仍旧在里面，然后，似乎又犹豫不定，不知该把它藏在哪个口袋里才好，他好象觉得哪个口袋都不够安全似的，最后他把它夹在了一条红手帕里，把手帕小心地盘在了他的头上。接着，他又从碗柜里拿出钞票和金洋，一包塞进了他的裤子口袋里，一包塞进了他的背心口袋里，匆匆地拿了两三件内衣捆成了一个小包袱，就冲到门口，消失在夜的黑暗里。 \n “当时我一切都明白了。我为刚才所发生的事而责备自己，好象这桩罪案是我自己干的似的。我觉得似乎听到了一点微弱的呻吟声，就满心以为那不幸的珠宝商还没断气，我决定去救他，希望借此略微赎一下我的罪过，不是赎我自己所犯的那个罪，而是赎我刚才没有设法去阻止的那个罪。心里这么想着，我便使出了全身的力气从我所蜷伏的地方撞进了隔壁房间里去，我和里面的那房间原本就是隔着一块参差不齐的木板，经我用力一撞，木板就倒了下去，我发觉自己已进到了屋子里面。我赶快抓起那支点着的蜡烛，急忙奔上楼梯，才上到一半，我便踩着了一个横卧在楼梯上的人，几乎跌了一交。那是卡康脱女人的尸体！我听到的那声枪响无疑地是冲这个倒霉的女人开的，子弹可怕地撕裂了她的喉咙，留下了一个裂开的伤口，从那伤口里，从她的嘴里，血象泉水似的汩汩地冒了出来。看到这个可怜的人已救不活了，我便一步跨过去，走到了卧室里。卧室里乱得一塌糊涂，那场殊死搏斗无疑就是在这儿进行的，家具都打得东倒西歪的，床单拖到了地板上，无疑那是不幸的珠宝商紧紧地抱住了它的缘故。那被害的人正躺在地板上，头靠着墙壁，浑身鲜血淋淋，血从他胸部的三个伤口里直喷出来，在第四个伤口里，插着一把厨房里用的切菜刀，只剩刀把还露在外面。 \n “我的脚踩到了一把手枪，这把手枪没有用过，大概是火药湿了的缘故。我向那珠宝商走去，他还没最后咽气，我的脚步也在格吱格吱地响，听到了我的脚步声，他睁开了眼，盯我一会儿，嘴唇动了几下，象是想说什么话，但立刻就断了气。这一幕凄惨的景象几乎使我失去了知觉，既然对这屋里的任何人我都无能为力了，我惟一的念头便是逃走，我冲到了楼梯口，两手紧捂着我那火烧般的太阳穴，嘴里惊恐地喊叫着，一到楼下的房间里，我就看见五六个海关关员和两三个宪兵已在那儿了。他们一下子就抓住了我，而我当时甚至连抵抗都不想抵抗，因为我的神志已经不清了，我想说话，却只能发出一些含糊不清的声音。我看见其中几个人冲我指了指，于是我低头一看才发现自己浑身都是血。原来从楼梯缝里漏到我身上的那一滴滴温热的雨是卡康脱女人的血。我用手指了一下我刚才躲藏的地方。‘他是什么意思？’一个宪兵问道。一个税务员走到了我所指的那个地方。‘他的意思是说，’他回来的时候说道，‘他是从这个洞里钻进来的，’一面指着我撞破板壁进来的那个地方。 \n “直到这时我才明白他们原来把我当作杀人犯了。现在我的声音和体力都恢复了。我挣扎着想摆脱那抓住我的两个人，嘴里大喊道，‘不是我杀的！不是我杀的！’两个宪兵用他们马枪的枪口顶住了我的胸部，‘再动一动，’他们说，‘就崩了你！’‘你们为什么要用死来恐吓我，’我大喊道，‘我不是已经说过我是无罪的了吗？’‘你到尼姆去对法官讲你这个小小的故事吧。现在先跟我们走吧，我们所能给你的最好的忠告就是不要抵抗。’抵抗我是想都没想到的。我已经给吓坏了，我一言不发地让人给带上了手铐，绑在了一匹马的尾巴上，然后就在这种情景下到了尼姆。 \n “按当时的情形推测，大概有一个官员一直尾随着我，跟到客栈附近便失掉了我的踪迹，他想我一定准备在那儿过夜的，就回去召集了他的人来，他们到达的时候，恰巧听到了那一声枪响，在这种罪证确凿的情形下捉住了我，所以我立刻明白了，要证明我的无辜已是很困难的了。我唯一的希望就是请求审问我的那位法官能去查询一位名叫布沙尼的神甫，因为他曾在凶杀案发生的前一天早晨到过杜加桥客栈。假如有关钻石的那个故事的，确是卡德鲁斯自己瞎编的，而世界上根本就没有布沙尼神甫这么个人，那么，我就没救了，除非能把卡德鲁斯本人捉到，而且能使他自己招供一切。 \n “这样过了两个月，我应该感谢那位法官，因为他派人到处去寻找我想见的那个人。我已经放弃了一切希望。卡德鲁斯没有捉到，而秋季大审却一天天的迫近了，忽然，在九月八日那天，也就是说，正巧在事件发生后的三个月零五天，那位我认为已没希望再见到的布沙尼神甫，主动地到监狱里来了，说他知道有一个犯人想和他说话。他说，他在马赛时听说了那件事，所以就赶快来了却我的心愿了。您很容易想象得到，我是带着多么感激的情绪欢迎他的，我把我的所见所闻全都讲给了他听。当我讲到有关钻石的事，我觉得有点后怕，但使我万分惊奇的是，他竟加以证实了，认为一点不假，而使我同样惊奇的是，他对于我所讲的一切似乎全都相信。于是，我被他的仁爱感动了，同时看到他很熟悉我故乡的一切风俗习惯，又想到，我唯一真正的罪过就是那一个罪恶，只有从这样仁慈和博爱的人嘴里才能得到有力的宽恕，于是我就请他接受我的忏悔，而就在忏悔的封缄之下，我把阿都尔的事从头到尾详详细细地讲了出来。我这样作虽然是因为良心发现一时的冲动，但所产生的后果却如同经过冷静的思考以后的举动一样。我主动地承认阿都尔暗杀案证明了我这次的确没有犯罪。当他离开我的时候，叮嘱我不要气馁，他将竭力使法官相信我是无事的。 \n “我很快就感觉到了那位好心的神甫为我出力已经见效了，因为牢里对我的严格看管已逐渐放松了，他们告诉我，我的审判已经延期，不参加当时举行的大审了，而延迟到下一次巡回审判时再开庭。在这期间，上天保佑卡德鲁斯终于被捉到了，他们在国外一个很远的地方发现了他，把他押回了法国，他全部招供了，并推诿着说那件事是他妻子的主意并怂恿他干的。他被判处终生到奴隶船［一种帆桨并用的船，船上的苦工都是囚犯，用铁链锁在一起，在舱底划船。——译注］上去当苦役，而我则立刻释放了。” \n “这以后，我想，”基督山说道，“你就拿了布沙尼神甫的那封推荐信到我这儿来了，是不是？” \n “是的，大人，那位仁慈的神甫显然很关心我的一切。‘你干走私贩子这一行当，’有一天他对我说道，‘假如再一个劲儿干下去，将来总有一天你会毁掉自己的，我劝你，出狱以后，还是选一个比较安全也比较令人尊敬的行业干干吧。’‘但是’，我问道，‘我怎么能养活我自己和我那可怜的嫂嫂呢？’‘有一个人，我是他的忏悔师，’他回答说，‘他相当尊敬我，不久以前，他请我给他找一个可靠的仆人。你愿不愿意去？假如愿意，我可以为你写一封推荐信你去投奔我那位朋友吧。’‘噢，神甫，’我喊道，‘那太好了！’‘但你必须向我发誓，将来决不会使我后悔我的这次推荐。’我正要举手发誓。‘不必了，’他说道，‘我了解科西嘉人，而且也很喜欢科西嘉人，我就依赖这一点！喏，拿着这个去吧，’他迅速地写了几行字以后说道。于是我就带了那封信来见大人，您接到信以后，就收下了我，我现在斗胆地问一下大人，您究竟觉得我有什么做得不好的地方没有？” \n “正巧相反，贝尔图乔，我始终觉得你很忠心，诚实，称职。我只发觉你有一个缺点，就是你还不够信任我。” \n “真的，大人，我不明白您这句话是什么意思！” \n “我的意思是：你既然有一个嫂嫂和一个继子，为什么却从来没对我提起过他们呢？” \n “唉！我又得追述我生平那个最痛苦的阶段。您大概想象得到，我出狱后急于想去探望和安慰我那亲爱的嫂嫂，于是便不再浪费时间，马上回科西嘉去了，但当我到达洛格里亚诺的时候，我发觉那所屋子里在办丧事，那儿曾发生过一幕极其可怕的事情，邻居们到今天都还记得它，并一直在谈论它。我那可怜的嫂嫂遵照我的忠告行事，拒绝再满足贝尼代托的不合理的要求，但他只要相信她还剩一个铜板，就不断地逼迫她，向她要钱。有一天早晨，他又向她要钱，并恐吓她，要是她不把他要的数目给他，就会发生极其严重的后果，说完，他就走了，一整天也不回来，让那心地善良的爱苏泰独自去悲伤痛苦。爱苏泰是真心真意地爱他，就和自己亲生的孩子一样的，想到他的这些行为，就不禁恸哭了一番，看到他还不回来，又不免伤心落泪，夜晚来临了，可是，她还是怀着一颗母亲的心在那儿挂念着他，耐心地等候他回来。 \n “钟敲十一点了，他终于带着两个和他一路货色的同伴回来了。当可怜的爱苏泰站起来正要上前去拥抱她的浪子的时候，这三个恶棍捉住了她，其中的一个，或许就是那个混小子，我现在想起来还不免心惊胆战的，他大声说道，‘我们来让她吃点苦头，那样她就会乖乖地告诉我们钱在哪儿啦。’“不幸我们的邻居瓦西里奥当时碰巧到巴斯蒂亚去了，只留下他的妻子一人在家，除她以外，再没有别人能看到或听到我们家里所发生的任何事情了。贝尼代托的那两个残忍的同伴捉住了可怜的爱苏泰，爱苏泰决想不到他们会伤害她的，所以仍笑脸望着这些不久就要成为残害她的刽子手的人。另外那个恶棍开始把门窗都堵了起来，然后回到他无耻的帮凶那儿，三个人合力堵住了爱苏泰的嘴，那可怜的女人一看到这种可怕的情形，就大声喊叫起来。做完这一步以后，他们就用火盆去烙爱苏泰的脚，以为这样做就可以逼她说出我们那笔小小的积蓄究竟藏在什么地方。我那可怜的嫂嫂在挣扎的时候衣服着了火，他们为了要保全自己的性命，不得不放开了她。爱苏泰浑身着了火，她发疯般地冲到门口，门已经被反扣住了。她又飞奔到窗口，但窗户也已被堵住了。于是她的邻居听到了可怕的喊声，是爱苏泰在喊救命。但后来她的声音便窒息了，她的喊叫声渐渐地低了下去变成呻吟，第二天早晨，经过了一夜的焦急和恐怖，瓦西里奥的妻子终于鼓起勇气冒险出来，叫地方当局的人来打开了我们家的门，爱苏泰，尽管已被烧灼得体无完肤，却还没有断气。屋里的每一只抽屉和暗柜都被撬开了，凡是值得带走的东西都被劫走了。贝尼代托以后就再也没有在洛格里亚诺出现过，我也再没有见到过他，也不曾听人说起过有关他的任何事情。 \n “在这些可怕的事发生以后，我就来侍奉大人了，我觉得再向大人提起他们未免太愚蠢了，因为贝尼代托已毫无下落，而我的嫂嫂也已经死了。” \n “你对那件事怎么看？”基督山问道。 \n “这是一种惩罚，罚我所犯下的罪。”贝尔图乔答道。“噢，维尔福这一家人真都该天诛地灭！” \n “我相信会的。”伯爵用一种郁闷的口吻喃喃的说道。 \n “现在，”贝尔图乔又说，“大人或许该明白了吧，我曾在这座花园里杀过一个人，而我又再回到这个地方，因此我的情绪很不好，以致劳您过问这其中的原因。因为，简单地说，我不敢肯定维尔福先生是不是就躺在我脚前那个他为自己孩子所掘的坟墓里。” \n “的确，一切事情都是可能的，”基督山离开了他所坐的长凳，站起身来，“甚至”，他低声接着说道，“或许那位检察官并没有死。布沙尼神甫说得不错，你应该把你的身世讲给我听的，因为这可以使我将来不至于对你再发生误会了。至于贝尼代托，他既然这样罪大恶极，你后来有没有设法去打听一下，他究竟到哪儿去了，在干些什么？” \n “没有！要是我知道他在哪儿，非但不会去找他，而且会赶紧逃开，象看见妖魔一般。我从没听人提到过他的名字，我真希望他已经死了。” \n “别那么希望，贝尔图乔，”伯爵说道。“恶人是不会就那样死的，因为上帝似乎还要关照他们，他要用他们来作他报复的工具。” \n “希望如此，”贝尔图乔说道。“我只求今生今世再也不要看见他。伯爵阁下，”管家卑下地躬身向前，又说道，“现在您一切都知道了。万能的主是我在天上的裁判官，而您就是我地上的裁判官。您难道不说几句安慰我的话吗？” \n “我的好朋友，我所能对你说的和布沙尼神甫对你说的一样。维尔福，你所杀的那个人，是应该受到你对他的那种惩罚的，这是公正的做法，因为他不该那样对待你，或许，他另外还犯过别的罪。贝尼代托，假如他还活着的话，会在某件事上变成上天报应的工具，他也会受到惩罚的，至于说到你，我看有一点上你是真正有罪的。你且自问一下，你把那婴儿从活埋他的坟墓里救出来以后，为什么不把他送还给他的母亲。这是罪过啊，贝尔图乔。” \n “没错，大人，这一点，正如您所说的，我干得很不对，在这一点上我简直象个懦夫。我把那个孩子救活以后，我最应尽的责任就是应当马上把他送还给他的母亲，但那样做，我就免不了要被人细细地盘问，而一经盘问，我自己多半就会被人捉住。而我当时却非常想活命，一半是为了我的嫂嫂，一半是出于我心里天生的那种傲性，我在报仇成功以后，总希望能干干净净地脱身。或许，也是那种贪生怕死的本能使我想避免冒险吧。噢！我真不如我那可怜的哥哥勇敢。” \n 贝尔图乔说这几句话的时候用双手捂住了他的脸，而基督山则用一种无法描述的目光凝视着他。伯爵暂时沉默了一会儿，这短暂的沉默使周围的气氛更加严肃起来，尤其是在这样的时间，这样的地点。一会儿之后，他用一种完全不同于他平时那抑郁的口吻说道：“我们今天的游览就到此为止吧，为了正式结束这番谈话，我可以把布沙尼神甫亲口对我说过的几句话复述给你听：‘一切罪恶只有两帖药——时间和沉默。’贝尔图乔先生，现在让我一个人在这个花园里散一会儿步吧。你在那幕可怕的场景里是一个演员，旧地重游会引起你痛苦的回忆，但我却几乎可以说很高兴，觉得这处产业已增值不少了。你知道，贝尔图乔先生，树木之年之所以能使人觉得可爱就是因为它们能遮成树荫，而树荫之所以使人觉得可爱，就是因为它让人充满了幻想。我在这儿买了一座花园，原以为只是买了一块四面有围墙的地方而已，但现在这个地方却突然变成了一个鬼影憧憧的花园，而在契约上却不曾提到过。我喜欢鬼，我从没听说过死人用六千年时间所做的恶事能超过活人在一天之内所犯的罪过。去休息吧，贝尔图乔，安心去睡觉好了。在你临终的时候，假如你的忏悔师没有布沙尼神甫那样宽容，要是我还活着，你可以派人来找我，我可以找些话来安慰你的灵魂，使你安心地踏上那‘永恒’的崎岖的旅程。” \n 贝尔图乔恭恭敬敬地鞠了一躬，便转身叹着气走了。当他走出了视线的时候，基督山就站起身来，向前走了几步，轻轻地说：“这儿，就在这棵梧桐底下，是那婴儿的坟墓。那个是通花园的小门。这个角上是通卧室的暗梯。这些情节我用不着记录在本子上，因为它们就在我眼前，就在我的脚下，就在我的周围，种种活生生的事实已给我勾出了一个轮廓。” \n 伯爵又在花园里转了一遍，然后，重新登上他的马车，贝尔图乔看到他的主人面带深思的表情，就默默地去坐在了车夫旁边。马车迅速地向巴黎奔去。 \n 当天晚上，到达香榭丽舍大道的寓所以后，基督山伯爵到全房子各处去巡视了一遍，看起来象是对于每个转弯抹角都早已摸熟了似的。尽管他领头在前面走，却不曾摸错一扇门，走错一条走廊或楼梯，他总能一点不错地走到他想看的地方或房间。阿里陪着他作这次夜间视察。伯爵先向贝尔图乔吩咐了一番，告诉他房间里应如何改进和变换，然后又摸出表来看了一眼，对那在一旁恭候着的黑奴说道：“现在已经十一点半了，海黛就快到了。你有没有去通知一声那些法国女佣人？” \n 阿里用手指了指留给希腊美人用的那几个房间，那些房间可说是和全屋的其他房间隔离的，当房门被帘子遮住的时候，人即使走遍全屋也不会发现那个地方还有一间客厅和两个房间。阿里在指过房间以后，又伸出了左手的三个手指，然后，把手垫在他的头下，闭上眼睛，做出一副睡觉的样子。 \n “我懂了，”基督山说道，他很熟悉阿里的手势，“你的意思是告诉我有三个女佣人等在卧室里。” \n 阿里连连点头。 \n “夫人今天晚上一定很累了，”基督山又说道，“她一到立刻就会想休息的。叫那些法国女佣人不要问这问那地去打扰她，叫她们请安以后就退出去。你也防着一点儿，别让那些希腊女佣人和这些法国女佣有什么往来。” \n 阿里鞠了一躬。正在这时，他们听到了喊门房的声音。大门开了，一辆马车驶进了车道，在门廊的台阶前停了下来。伯爵走下台阶，走到那已经打开的车门前面。他把他的手伸给了一个青年女子。那个青年女子全身都裹在一件绿色绣金的披风里，她把伯爵的手放到她的唇边，爱慕和崇敬地吻了一下。他们又用荷马写史诗的那种音调铿锵的语言交谈了几句话。 \n 那女人说话的时候表情非常亲切，而伯爵答话的时候神气也很温和庄重。这个女的不是别人，就是在意大利陪伴基督山那个可爱的希腊女人。阿里手里拿着一支玫瑰色的蜡烛在前领路，引她到了她的房间里，而伯爵也回到了他自己的房间里去休息了。一小时之后，屋子里的每一盏灯都熄灭了，也许府里所有的人都已经入睡了。 \n \n
