{"id":43941,"no":73,"title":"Chapter 78 We hear From Yanina","content":"IF VALENTINE could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of Franz when he quitted the chamber of M. Noirtier, even she would have been constrained to pity him. Villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences, and then retired to his study, where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter:-- \\n\\n \"After all the disclosures which were made this morning, M. Noirtier de Villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of M. Franz d\u0027Epinay. M. d\u0027Epinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that M. de Villefort, who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning, should not have anticipated him in this announcement.\" \\n\\n No one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance; although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor, or rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history. And in justice to Villefort, it must be understood that M. Noirtier, who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject, had always omitted to explain the affair to Villefort, so that he had all his life entertained the belief that General de Quesnel, or the Baron d\u0027Epinay, as he was alternately styled, according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name, or by the title which had been conferred on him, fell the victim of assassination, and not that he was killed fairly in a duel. This harsh letter, coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful, struck a mortal blow at the pride of Villefort. Hardly had he read the letter, when his wife entered. The sudden departure of Franz, after being summoned by M. Noirtier, had so much astonished every one, that the position of Madame de Villefort, left alone with the notary and the witnesses, became every moment more embarrassing. Determined to bear it no longer, she arose and left the room; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance. \\n\\n M. de Villefort\u0027s communications on the subject were very limited and concise; he told her, in fact, that an explanation had taken place between M. Noirtier, M. d\u0027Epinay, and himself, and that the marriage of Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken off. This was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were awaiting her return in the chamber of her father-in-law. She therefore contented herself with saying that M. Noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit, the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer. This news, false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred, evidently astonished the auditors, and they retired without a word. During this time Valentine, at once terrified and happy, after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable, asked leave to retire to her own room, in order to recover her composure. Noirtier looked the permission which she solicited. But instead of going to her own room, Valentine, having once gained her liberty, entered the gallery, and, opening a small door at the end of it. found herself at once in the garden. \\n\\n In the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other, an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of Valentine\u0027s mind. She expected every moment that she should see Morrel appear, pale and trembling, to forbid the signing of the contract, like the Laird of Ravenswood in \"The Bride of Lammermoor.\" It was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate, for Maximilian had long awaited her coming. He had half guessed what was going on when he saw Franz quit the cemetery with M. de Villefort. He followed M. d\u0027Epinay, saw him enter, afterwards go out, and then re-enter with Albert and Chateau-Renaud. He had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference; he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover-patch, prepared to hear the result of the proceedings, and very certain that Valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should he set at liberty. He was not mistaken; peering through the crevices of the wooden partition, he soon discovered the young girl, who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier. The first glance which Maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him, and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight. \\n\\n \"We are saved!\" said Valentine. \"Saved?\" repeated Morrel, not being able to conceive such intense happiness; \"by whom?\" \\n\\n \"By my grandfather. Oh, Morrel, pray love him for all his goodness to us!\" Morrel swore to love him with all his soul; and at that moment he could safely promise to do so, for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father. \"But tell me, Valentine, how has it all been effected? What strange means has he used to compass this blessed end?\" \\n\\n Valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed, but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather, and she said, \"At some future time I will tell you all about it.\" \\n\\n \"But when will that be?\" \\n\\n \"When I am your wife.\" \\n\\n The conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to Morrel, that he was ready to accede to anything that Valentine thought fit to propose, and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day. However, he would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine again the next night. Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her, and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry Franz. During the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed, Madame de Villefort had gone to visit M. Noirtier. The old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her. \\n\\n \"Sir,\" said she, \"it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentine\u0027s marriage is broken off, since it was here that the affair was concluded.\" Noirtier\u0027s countenance remained immovable. \"But one thing I can tell you, of which I do not think you are aware; that is, that I have always been opposed to this marriage, and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation.\" Noirtier regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring an explanation. \"Now that this marriage, which I know you so much disliked, is done away with, I come to you on an errand which neither M. de Villefort nor Valentine could consistently undertake.\" Noirtier\u0027s eyes demanded the nature of her mission. \"I come to entreat you, sir,\" continued Madame de Villefort, \"as the only one who has the right of doing so, inasmuch as I am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction,--I come to entreat you to restore, not your love, for that she has always possessed, but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter.\" \\n\\n There was a doubtful expression in Noirtier\u0027s eyes; he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not succeed in doing so. \"May I hope, sir,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"that your intentions accord with my request?\" Noirtier made a sign that they did. \"In that case, sir,\" rejoined Madame de Villefort, \"I will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes.\" She then bowed to M. Noirtier and retired. \\n\\n The next day M. Noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was torn up and a second made, in which he left the whole of his fortune to Valentine, on condition that she should never be separated from him. It was then generally reported that Mademoiselle de Villefort, the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of Saint-Méran, had regained the good graces of her grandfather, and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300,000 livres. \\n\\n While all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriage-contract were being carried on at the house of M. de Villefort, Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf, who, in order to lose no time in responding to M. Danglars\u0027 wishes, and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society, donned his uniform of lieutenant-general, which he ornamented with all his crosses, and thus attired, ordered his finest horses and drove to the Rue de la Chausse d\u0027Antin. \\n\\n Danglars was balancing his monthly accounts, and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor. At the first sight of his old friend, Danglars assumed his majestic air, and settled himself in his easy-chair. Morcerf, usually so stiff and formal, accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner, and, feeling sure that the overture he was about make would be well received, he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manoeuvres in order to gain his end, but went at once straight to the point. \\n\\n \"Well, baron,\" said he, \"here I am at last; some time has elapsed since our plans were formed, and they are not yet executed.\" Morcerf paused at these words, quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars, and which he attributed to his silence; but, on the contrary, to his great surprise, it grew darker and darker. \"To what do you allude, monsieur?\" said Danglars; as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general\u0027s words. \\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Morcerf, \"I see you are a stickler for forms, my dear sir, and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted. Ma foi! I beg your pardon, but as I have but one son, and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him, I am still serving my apprenticeship, you know; come, I will reform.\" And Morcerf with a forced smile arose, and, making a low bow to M. Danglars, said: \"Baron, I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars for my son, the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf.\" \\n\\n But Danglars, instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which Morcerf had expected, knit his brow, and without inviting the count, who was still standing, to take a seat. he said: \"Monsieur, it will be necessary to reflect before I give you an answer.\" \\n\\n \"To reflect?\" said Morcerf, more and more astonished; \"have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us?\" \\n\\n \"Count,\" said the banker, \"things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions, or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances, which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them.\" \\n\\n \"I do not understand you, baron,\" said Morcerf. \\n\\n \"What I mean to say is this, sir,--that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred\"-- \\n\\n \"Excuse me,\" said Morcerf, \"but is it a play we are acting?\" \\n\\n \"A play?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, for it is like one; pray let us come more to the point, and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other.\" \\n\\n \"That is quite my desire.\" \\n\\n \"You have seen M. de Monte Cristo have you not?\" \\n\\n \"I see him very often,\" said Danglars, drawing himself up; \"he is a particular friend of mine.\" \\n\\n \"Well, in one of your late conversations with him, you said that I appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage, did you not?\" \\n\\n \"I did say so.\" \\n\\n \"Well, here I am, proving at once that I am really neither the one nor the other, by entreating you to keep your promise on that score.\" \\n\\n Danglars did not answer. \"Have you so soon changed your mind,\" added Morcerf, \"or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled?\" Danglars, seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it, the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage, turned to Morcerf, and said: \"Count, you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve, and I assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you; but, believe me when I say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me.\" \\n\\n \"These are all so many empty words, my dear sir,\" said Morcerf: \"they might satisfy a new acquaintance, but the Comte de Morcerf does not rank in that list; and when a man like him comes to another, recalls to him his plighted word, and this man fails to redeem the pledge, he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing.\" Danglars was a coward, but did not wish to appear so; he was piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just assumed. \"I am not without a good reason for my conduct,\" replied the banker. \\n\\n \"What do you mean to say?\" \\n\\n \"I mean to say that I have a good reason, but that it is difficult to explain.\" \\n\\n \"You must be aware, at all events, that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me; but one thing at least is clear, which is, that you decline allying yourself with my family.\" \\n\\n \"No, sir,\" said Danglars; \"I merely suspend my decision, that is all.\" \\n\\n \"And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your caprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces?\" \\n\\n \"Then, count, if you will not wait, we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained.\" The count bit his lips till the blood almost started, to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain; understanding, however, that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him, he turned from the door, towards which he had been directing his steps, and again confronted the banker. A cloud settled on his brow, evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness, instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there. \"My dear Danglars,\" said Morcerf, \"we have been acquainted for many years, and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each other\u0027s failings. You owe me an explanation, and really it is but fair that I should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor.\" \\n\\n \"It is from no personal ill-feeling towards the viscount, that is all I can say, sir,\" replied Danglars, who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and calmed down. \"And towards whom do you bear this personal ill-feeling, then?\" said Morcerf, turning pale with anger. The expression of the count\u0027s face had not remained unperceived by the banker; he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before, and said: \"You may, perhaps, be better satisfied that I should not go farther into particulars.\" \\n\\n A tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count, and making a violent effort over himself, he said: \"I have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation. Is it Madame de Morcerf who has displeased you? Is it my fortune which you find insufficient? Is it because my opinions differ from yours?\" \\n\\n \"Nothing of the kind, sir,\" replied Danglars: \"if such had been the case, I only should have been to blame, inasmuch as I was aware of all these things when I made the engagement. No, do not seek any longer to discover the reason. I really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self-examination; let us drop the subject, and adopt the middle course of delay, which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement. Ma foi! there is no hurry. My daughter is only seventeen years old, and your son twenty-one. While we wait, time will be progressing, events will succeed each other; things which in the evening look dark and obscure, appear but too clearly in the light of morning, and sometimes the utterance of one word, or the lapse of a single day, will reveal the most cruel calumnies.\" \\n\\n \"Calumnies, did you say, sir?\" cried Morcerf, turning livid with rage. \"Does any one dare to slander me?\" \\n\\n \"Monsieur, I told you that I considered it best to avoid all explanation.\" \\n\\n \"Then, sir, I am patiently to submit to your refusal?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, sir, although I assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive, for I had reckoned on the honor of your alliance, and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman.\" \\n\\n \"Enough, sir,\" said Morcerf, \"we will speak no more on the subject.\" And clutching his gloves in anger, he left the apartment. Danglars observed that during the whole conversation Morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that Danglars recalled his word. That evening he had a long conference with several friends; and M. Cavalcanti, who had remained in the drawing-room with the ladies, was the last to leave the banker\u0027s house. \\n\\n The next morning, as soon as he awoke, Danglars asked for the newspapers; they were brought to him; he laid aside three or four, and at last fixed on the Impartial, the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief editor. He hastily tore off the cover, opened the journal with nervous precipitation, passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings, and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence, stopped with a malicious smile, at a paragraph headed \"We hear from Yanina.\" \\n\\n \"Very good,\" observed Danglars, after having read the paragraph; \"here is a little article on Colonel Fernand, which, if I am not mistaken, would render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary.\" \\n\\n At the same moment, that is, at nine o\u0027clock in the morning, Albert de Morcerf, dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin, might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of Monte Cristo\u0027s house in the Champs Elysées. When he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about half an hour previously. \"Did he take Baptistin with him?\" \\n\\n \"No, my lord.\" \\n\\n \"Call him, then; I wish to speak to him.\" The concièrge went to seek the valet de chambre, and returned with him in an instant. \\n\\n \"My good friend,\" said Albert, \"I beg pardon for my intrusion, but I was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not.\" \\n\\n \"He is really out, sir,\" replied Baptistin. \\n\\n \"Out, even to me?\" \\n\\n \"I know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte,\" said Baptistin; \"and I should therefore never think of including him in any general order.\" \\n\\n \"You are right; and now I wish to see him on an affair of great importance. Do you think it will be long before he comes in?\" \\n\\n \"No, I think not, for he ordered his breakfast at ten o\u0027clock.\" \\n\\n \"Well, I will go and take a turn in the Champs Elysées, and at ten o\u0027clock I will return here; meanwhile, if the count should come in, will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me?\" \\n\\n \"You may depend on my doing so, sir,\" said Baptistin. \\n\\n Albert left the cab in which he had come at the count\u0027s door, intending to take a turn on foot. As he was passing the Allée des Veuves, he thought he saw the count\u0027s horses standing at Gosset\u0027s shooting-gallery; he approached, and soon recognized the coachman. \"Is the count shooting in the gallery?\" said Morcerf. \\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" replied the coachman. While he was speaking, Albert had heard the report of two or three pistol-shots. He entered, and on his way met the waiter. \"Excuse me, my lord,\" said the lad; \"but will you have the kindness to wait a moment?\" \\n\\n \"What for, Philip?\" asked Albert, who, being a constant visitor there, did not understand this opposition to his entrance. \\n\\n \"Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone, and never practices in the presence of any one.\" \\n\\n \"Not even before you, Philip? Then who loads his pistol?\" \\n\\n \"His servant.\" \\n\\n \"A Nubian?\" \\n\\n \"A negro.\" \\n\\n \"It is he, then.\" \\n\\n \"Do you know this gentleman?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, and I am come to look for him; he is a friend of mine.\" \\n\\n \"Oh, that is quite another thing, then. I will go immediately and inform him of your arrival.\" And Philip, urged by his own curiosity, entered the gallery; a second afterwards, Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold. \"I ask your pardon, my dear count,\" said Albert, \"for following you here, and I must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that I did so; I alone am to blame for the indiscretion. I went to your house, and they told me you were out, but that they expected you home at ten o\u0027clock to breakfast. I was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o\u0027clock, when I caught sight of your carriage and horses.\" \\n\\n \"What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me.\" \\n\\n \"No, thank you, I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now; perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company.\" \\n\\n \"What on earth are you talking of?\" \\n\\n \"I am to fight to-day.\" \\n\\n \"For what?\" \\n\\n \"I am going to fight\"-- \\n\\n \"Yes, I understand that, but what is the quarrel? People fight for all sorts of reasons, you know.\"- \\n\\n \"I fight in the cause of honor.\" \\n\\n \"Ah, that is something serious.\" \\n\\n \"So serious, that I come to beg you to render me a service.\" \\n\\n \"What is it?\" \\n\\n \"To be my second.\" \\n\\n \"That is a serious matter, and we will not discuss it here; let us speak of nothing till we get home. Ali, bring me some water.\" The count turned up his sleeves, and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting. \"Come in, my lord,\" said Philip in a low tone, \"and I will show you something droll.\" Morcerf entered, and in place of the usual target, he saw some playing-cards fixed against the wall. At a distance Albert thought it was a complete suit, for he counted from the ace to the ten. \"Ah, ha,\" said Albert, \"I see you were preparing for a game of cards.\" \\n\\n \"No,\" said the count, \"I was making a suit.\" \\n\\n \"How?\" said Albert. \\n\\n \"Those are really aces and twos which you see, but my shots have turned them into threes, fives, sevens, eights, nines, and tens.\" Albert approached. In fact, the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied, the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil. \\n\\n \"Diable!\" said Morcerf. \\n\\n \"What would you have, my dear viscount?\" said Monte Cristo, wiping his hands on the towel which Ali had brought him; \"I must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other. But come, I am waiting for you.\" Both men entered Monte Cristo\u0027s carriage, which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at No. 30. Monte Cristo took Albert into his study, and pointing to a seat, placed another for himself. \"Now let us talk the matter over quietly,\" said the count. \\n\\n \"You see I am perfectly composed,\" said Albert. \\n\\n \"With whom are you going to fight?\" \\n\\n \"With Beauchamp.\" \\n\\n \"One of your friends!\" \\n\\n \"Of course; it is always with friends that one fights.\" \\n\\n \"I suppose you have some cause of quarrel?\" \\n\\n \"I have.\" \\n\\n \"What has he done to you?\" \\n\\n \"There appeared in his journal last night--but wait, and read for yourself.\" And Albert handed over the paper to the count, who read as follows:-- \\n\\n \"A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance. The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand, in whom the grand vizier, Ali Tepelini, had reposed the greatest confidence.\" \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Monte Cristo, \"what do you see in that to annoy you?\" \\n\\n \"What do I see in it?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given up by a French officer?\" \\n\\n \"It signifies to my father, the Count of Morcerf, whose Christian name is Fernand!\" \\n\\n \"Did your father serve under Ali Pasha?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; that is to say, he fought for the independence of the Greeks, and hence arises the calumny.\" \\n\\n \"Oh, my dear viscount, do talk reason!\" \\n\\n \"I do not desire to do otherwise.\" \\n\\n \"Now, just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person? and who cares now about Yanina, which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or 1823?\" \\n\\n \"That just shows the meanness of this slander. They have allowed all this time to elapse, and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal, in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position. I inherit my father\u0027s name, and I do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it. I am going to Beauchamp, in whose journal this paragraph appears, and I shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses.\" \\n\\n \"Beauchamp will never retract.\" \\n\\n \"Then he must fight.\" \\n\\n \"No he will not, for he will tell you, what is very true, that perhaps there were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same name.\" \\n\\n \"We will fight, nevertheless. I will efface that blot on my father\u0027s character. My father, who was such a brave soldier, whose career was so brilliant\"-- \\n\\n \"Oh, well, he will add, \u0027We are warranted in believing that this Fernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf, who also bears the same Christian name.\u0027\" \\n\\n \"I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation.\" \\n\\n \"And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses, do you?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"You do wrong.\" \\n\\n \"Which means, I suppose, that you refuse the service which I asked of you?\" \\n\\n \"You know my theory regarding duels; I told you my opinion on that subject, if you remember, when we were at Rome.\" \\n\\n \"Nevertheless, my dear count, I found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain.\" \\n\\n \"Because, my dear fellow, you understand one must never be eccentric. If one\u0027s lot is cast among fools, it is necessary to study folly. I shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp, who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with Beauchamp; he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other, he will bring his witnesses, or will insult me in some public place, and I am expected to kill him for all that.\" \\n\\n \"You admit that you would fight, then? Well, if so, why do you object to my doing so?\" \\n\\n \"I do not say that you ought not to fight, I only say that a duel is a serious thing, and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection.\" \\n\\n \"Did he reflect before he insulted my father?\" \\n\\n \"If he spoke hastily, and owns that he did so, you ought to be satisfied.\" \\n\\n \"Ah, my dear count, you are far too indulgent.\" \\n\\n \"And you are far too exacting. Supposing, for instance, and do not be angry at what I am going to say\"-- \\n\\n \"Well.\" \\n\\n \"Supposing the assertion to be really true?\" \\n\\n \"A son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father\u0027s honor.\" \\n\\n \"Ma foi! we live in times when there is much to which we must submit.\" \\n\\n \"That is precisely the fault of the age.\" \\n\\n \"And do you undertake to reform it?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, as far as I am personally concerned.\" \\n\\n \"Well, you the indeed exacting, my dear fellow!\" \\n\\n \"Yes, I own it.\" \\n\\n \"Are you quite impervious to good advice?\" \\n\\n \"Not when it comes from a friend.\" \\n\\n \"And do you account me that title?\" \\n\\n \"Certainly I do.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then, before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses, seek further information on the subject.\" \\n\\n \"From whom?\" \\n\\n \"From Haidée.\" \\n\\n \"Why, what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair?--what can she do in it?\" \\n\\n \"She can declare to you, for example, that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier; or if by chance he had, indeed, the misfortune to\"-- \\n\\n \"I have told you, my dear count, that I would not for one moment admit of such a proposition.\" \\n\\n \"You reject this means of information, then?\" \\n\\n \"I do--most decidedly.\" \\n\\n \"Then let me offer one more word of advice.\" \\n\\n \"Do so, then, but let it be the last.\" \\n\\n \"You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?\" \\n\\n \"On the contrary, I request it.\" \\n\\n \"Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchamp--visit him alone.\" \\n\\n \"That would be contrary to all custom.\" \\n\\n \"Your case is not an ordinary one.\" \\n\\n \"And what is your reason for advising me to go alone?\" \\n\\n \"Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauchamp.\" \\n\\n \"Explain yourself.\" \\n\\n \"I will do so. If Beauchamp be disposed to retract, you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will,--the satisfaction to you will be the same. If, on the contrary, he refuses to do so, it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret.\" \\n\\n \"They will not be strangers, they will be friends.\" \\n\\n \"Ah, but the friends of to-day are the enemies of to-morrow; Beauchamp, for instance.\" \\n\\n \"So you recommend\"-- \\n\\n \"I recommend you to be prudent.\" \\n\\n \"Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp?\" \\n\\n \"I do, and I will tell you why. When you wish to obtain some concession from a man\u0027s self-love, you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it.\" \\n\\n \"I believe you are right.\" \\n\\n \"I am glad of it.\" \\n\\n \"Then I will go alone.\" \\n\\n \"Go; but you would do better still by not going at all.\" \\n\\n \"That is impossible.\" \\n\\n \"Do so, then; it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed.\" \\n\\n \"But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight, will you not be my second?\" \\n\\n \"My dear viscount,\" said Monte Cristo gravely, \"you must have seen before to-day that at all times and in all places I have been at your disposal, but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you.\" \\n\\n \"Why?\" \\n\\n \"Perhaps you may know at some future period, and in the mean time I request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons.\" \\n\\n \"Well, I will have Franz and Chateau-Renaud; they will be the very men for it.\" \\n\\n \"Do so, then.\" \\n\\n \"But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?\" \\n\\n \"That, too, is impossible.\" \\n\\n \"What a singular being you are!--you will not interfere in anything.\" \\n\\n \"You are right--that is the principle on which I wish to act.\" \\n\\n \"We will say no more about it, then. Good-by, count.\" Morcerf took his hat, and left the room. He found his carriage at the door, and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp, who was in his office. It was a gloomy, dusty-looking apartment, such as journalists\u0027 offices have always been from time immemorial. The servant announced M. Albert de Morcerf. Beauchamp repeated the name to himself, as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright, and then gave orders for him to be admitted. Albert entered. Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room. \"This way, this way, my dear Albert!\" said he, holding out his hand to the young man. \"Are you out of your senses, or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me? Try and find a seat--there is one by that geranium, which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper.\" \\n\\n \"Beauchamp,\" said Albert, \"it is of your journal that I come to speak.\" \\n\\n \"Indeed? What do you wish to say about it?\" \\n\\n \"I desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified.\" \\n\\n \"To what do you refer? But pray sit down.\" \\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Albert, with a cold and formal bow. \\n\\n \"Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you?\" \\n\\n \"An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family.\" \\n\\n \"What is it?\" said Beauchamp, much surprised; \"surely you must be mistaken.\" \\n\\n \"The story sent you from Yanina.\" \\n\\n \"Yanina?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here.\" \\n\\n \"Such is really the case, I assure you, upon my honor! Baptiste, give me yesterday\u0027s paper,\" cried Beauchamp. \\n\\n \"Here, I have brought mine with me,\" replied Albert. \\n\\n Beauchamp took the paper, and read the article to which Albert pointed in an undertone. \"You see it is a serious annoyance,\" said Morcerf, when Beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph. \"Is the officer referred to a relation of yours, then?\" demanded the journalist. \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Albert, blushing. \\n\\n \"Well, what do you wish me to do for you?\" said Beauchamp mildly. \\n\\n \"My dear Beauchamp, I wish you to contradict this statement.\" Beauchamp looked at Albert with a benevolent expression. \\n\\n \"Come,\" said he, \"this matter will want a good deal of talking over; a retractation is always a serious thing, you know. Sit down, and I will read it again.\" Albert resumed his seat, and Beauchamp read, with more attention than at first, the lines denounced by his friend. \"Well,\" said Albert in a determined tone, \"you see that your paper his insulted a member of my family, and I insist on a retractation being made.\" \\n\\n \"You insist?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, I insist.\" \\n\\n \"Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber, my dear Viscount.\" \\n\\n \"Nor do I wish to be there,\" replied the young man, rising. \"I repeat that I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted. You have known me long enough,\" continued Albert, biting his lips convulsively, for he saw that Beauchamp\u0027s anger was beginning to rise,--\"you have been my friend, and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this point.\" \\n\\n \"If I have been your friend, Morcerf, your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that title. But wait a moment, do not let us get angry, or at least not yet. You are irritated and vexed--tell me how this Fernand is related to you?\" \\n\\n \"He is merely my father,\" said Albert--\"M. Fernand Mondego, Count of Morcerf, an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace.\" \\n\\n \"Is it your father?\" said Beauchamp; \"that is quite another thing. Then can well understand your indignation, my dear Albert. I will look at it again;\" and he read the paragraph for the third time, laying a stress on each word as he proceeded. \"But the paper nowhere identifies this Fernand with your father.\" \\n\\n \"No; but the connection will be seen by others, and therefore I will have the article contradicted.\" \\n\\n At the words I will, Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to Albert\u0027s countenance, and then as gradually lowering them, he remained thoughtful for a few moments. \"You will retract this assertion, will you not, Beauchamp?\" said Albert with increased though stifled anger. \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied Beauchamp. \\n\\n \"Immediately?\" said Albert. \\n\\n \"When I am convinced that the statement is false.\" \\n\\n \"What?\" \\n\\n \"The thing is worth looking into, and I will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly.\" \\n\\n \"But what is there to investigate, sir?\" said Albert, enraged beyond measure at Beauchamp\u0027s last remark. \"If you do not believe that it is my father, say so immediately; and if, on the contrary, you believe it to be him, state your reasons for doing so.\" Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him, and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind. \"Sir,\" replied he, \"if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction, you should have gone at once to the point, and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which I have been patiently listening for the last half hour. Am I to put this construction on your visit?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny.\" \\n\\n \"Wait a moment--no threats, if you please, M. Fernand Mondego, Vicomte de Morcerf; I never allow them from my enemies, and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends. You insist on my contradicting the article relating to General Fernand, an article with which, I assure you on my word of honor, I had nothing whatever to do?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, I insist on it,\" said Albert, whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings. \\n\\n \"And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?\" said Beauchamp in a calm tone. \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied Albert, raising his voice. \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Beauchamp, \"here is my answer, my dear sir. The article was not inserted by me--I was not even aware of it; but you have, by the step you have taken, called my attention to the paragraph in question, and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by some one who has a right to do so.\" \\n\\n \"Sir,\" said Albert, rising, \"I will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you, and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons.\" \\n\\n \"Certainly, my dear sir.\" \\n\\n \"And this evening, if you please, or to-morrow at the latest, we will meet.\" \\n\\n \"No, no, I will be on the ground at the proper time; but in my opinion (and I have a right to dictate the preliminaries, as it is I who have received the provocation)--in my opinion the time ought not to be yet. I know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword, while I am only moderately so; I know, too, that you are a good marksman--there we are about equal. I know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair, because you are brave, and I am brave also. I do not therefore wish either to kill you, or to be killed myself without a cause. Now, I am going to put a question to you, and one very much to the purpose too. Do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if I do not make it, although I have repeated more than once, and affirmed on my honor, that I was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me, and although I still declare that it is impossible for any one but you to recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand?\" \\n\\n \"I maintain my original resolution.\" \\n\\n \"Very well, my dear sir; then I consent to cut throats with you. But I require three weeks\u0027 preparation; at the end of that time I shall come and say to you, \u0027The assertion is false, and I retract it,\u0027 or \u0027The assertion is true,\u0027 when I shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath, or the pistols from the case, whichever you please.\" \\n\\n \"Three weeks!\" cried Albert; \"they will pass as slowly as three centuries when I am all the time suffering dishonor.\" \"Had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me, I should have said, \u0027Patience, my friend;\u0027 but you have constituted yourself my enemy, therefore I say, \u0027What does that signify to me, sir?\u0027\" \\n\\n \"Well, let it be three weeks then,\" said Morcerf; \"but remember, at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in\"-- \\n\\n \"M. Albert de Morcerf,\" said Beauchamp, rising in his turn, \"I cannot throw you out of window for three weeks--that is to say, for twenty-four days to come--nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed. To-day is the 29th of August; the 21st of September will, therefore, be the conclusion of the term agreed on, and till that time arrives--and it is the advice of a gentleman which I am about to give you--till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other.\" When he had concluded his speech, Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert, turned his back upon him, and went to the press-room. \\n\\n 如果瓦朗蒂娜能看到弗兰兹离开诺瓦蒂埃先生房间时的那种的脚步和神色，她甚至也会对他产生怜悯。维尔福说了几句前言不搭后语的话，就回到他自己的书房，大约过了两小时，他收到下面的这封信：“今晨的那一番揭露以后，诺瓦蒂埃·维尔福先生一定已经看出了：他的家庭和弗兰兹·伊皮奈先生的家庭联姻是不可能的了。弗兰兹·伊皮奈先生感到维尔福先生好像早已经知道今天早晨所讲的那件事，但毕竟没有料到会出现这么一种宣布，弗兰兹先生深表震惊。” \\n\\n 而这时谁要是看见这位法官大人，见到他被搞得垂头丧气的模样，他就会相信维尔福没预料到会出现这种结局；的确，他怎么也想不到他父亲竟会坦白或冒失到讲出这么一段历史来。说句公道话，维尔福一直相信奎斯奈尔将军或伊皮奈男爵——这两种称呼都有人用，那个说话的人愿意称呼他的家名或者称呼他的爵衔而定——是被人暗杀掉的而不是在一场公平的决斗中被对手杀死的；因为诺瓦蒂埃先生不论做什么事情上都从来不顾及儿子的意见，那件事他从来没有向维尔福说明过。这封措词严厉的信对维尔福的自尊心是一个致命的打击，因为在此之前，写这封信的人从来都是如此之温文尔雅。 \\n\\n 维尔福刚回到他的书房，他的妻子就进来了。弗兰兹在诺瓦蒂埃先生召见之后的不辞而别使每一个人都非常吃惊，维尔福夫人一个人和公证人以见证人在一起，她此时愈来愈觉着迷惑不解。她再也忍受不了，便起身离开，说她要去问问理由。维尔福先生对这件事只是说诺瓦蒂埃先生向伊皮奈先生和他作了一番解释，瓦朗蒂娜和弗兰兹的婚姻即将因此破裂了。用这件理由去向那些等着她回去的人汇报未免太说不过去了。所以她只说诺瓦蒂埃先生在开始商讨的时候突然昏了过去，签约仪式要推迟几天才能举行。这个消息虽然是编造的，但是紧跟着那两件同样的不幸事件之后宣布出来的，显然把听的人惊呆了，他们一言不发地告退了，此时此刻，瓦朗蒂娜真是又惊又喜，她拥抱着那个衰弱的老人，感谢他这么一下子就解除了那条她以前一直认为无法摆脱的枷锁，然后请求让她回到自己的屋里去休息一下；诺瓦蒂埃表示他可以答应她的要求。但瓦朗蒂娜一但获得自由，却并没有回到她自己的屋里去，她转进一条走廊里，打开走廊一头的一扇小门，马上就到了花园里。在这种种接连来到的怪事发生的过程中，瓦朗蒂娜的脑子里老是存有一个极为不安的念头。她感觉莫雷尔随时都能带着苍白的脸色和颤抖的身子出现，来阻止婚约的签订，象《拉马摩尔的新娘》［英国十九世纪小说家司各特的历史小说。——译注］一书中的莱文斯乌德爵士一样。瓦朗蒂娜此时的确也应该到后门口去一下了。马西米兰看到弗兰兹和维尔福先生一起离开了坟场，就已经料到了他们的心境。他跟着伊皮奈先生，见他进去，出来，然后又带着阿尔贝和夏多·勒诺进去。事情已经再明白不过了。 \\n\\n 他急忙赶到他的菜园里去等候消息——因为瓦朗蒂娜一有脱身的机会，一定就会赶来见他。他的料想没有错，他从木板缝里瞧见那位年轻女郎摆脱了往常那种小心严严的样子，风风火火向他奔来。马西米兰一见到她，就完全放了心；而她说出第一句话又使他的心喜悦得猛跳起来。 \\n\\n “我们得救啦！”瓦朗蒂娜说。 \\n\\n “得救啦！”莫雷尔随声说，他想象不到竟能有这样的快乐。“谁救我们？” \\n\\n “我的祖父。噢，莫雷尔！爱他吧，是他给了我们这种种好运！” \\n\\n 莫雷尔发誓要用全部的灵魂去爱他。他做这个誓言毫不勉强，因为他此时觉着爱诺瓦蒂埃超过了朋友和父亲——他把他崇拜得如同一位天神。 \\n\\n “不过告诉我，瓦朗蒂娜，这事是怎么弄成的呢？他用的是什么奇特的方法呢？” \\n\\n 瓦朗蒂娜正想把一切经过讲出来，但忽然又意识到，如果那么做，就必须泄露一个可怕的秘密，而这个秘密不但牵连到别人，而且也牵涉到她的祖父，于是她就说：“这件事我将来可以源源本本地跟你说。” \\n\\n “可那得什么时候呢？” \\n\\n “在我成为你的妻子以后。” \\n\\n 话题现在已转到莫雷尔最喜欢的这一方面了，在这时他愿意接受所有的让步；他觉得他所得知的这些消息已足以让自己满意了。一天能听到这么多的消息已不算少了。可是，在瓦朗蒂娜没有答应他第二天傍晚再和他见面以前，他还是不肯离开。瓦朗蒂娜答应丁莫雷尔向她提出的一切要求了，一小时以前，如果有人对她说她可以不嫁给弗兰兹，实在感到难以相信，但现在如果有人向她说她可以和马西米兰结婚，她自然就不会那么觉着相信了。 \\n\\n 在刚才描写过的那场会见进行的过程中，维尔福夫人已去拜访过了诺瓦蒂埃先生。老人象往常见到她的时候一样，用严厉和厌恶的神情看着她。 \\n\\n “阁下，”她说，“瓦朗蒂娜的婚事已经无可挽回了，我跟您说这个是多余的，因为破裂就发生在这儿。 \\n\\n 诺瓦蒂埃依然毫不动色。 \\n\\n “但我可以跟您说一件事情，这件事儿我想您也许还不知道。就是，对于这门亲事，我从来都是反对的，最初而谈这项婚约的时候，根本没有得到过我的同意或赞许。” \\n\\n 诺瓦蒂埃用一种希望对方解释的目光望着他的儿媳妇。 \\n\\n “我知道您非常讨厌这门亲事，现在它已经完结了，我来向您提出一个维尔福先生或瓦朗蒂娜不好提出的请求。” \\n\\n 诺瓦蒂埃的眼光问那个请求是什么。 \\n\\n “我要求您，阁下，”维尔福夫人继续说，“因只有我一个人可以有资格这么做，因为只有我在这件事情上毫无私人的利害关系——我要求您赐回，不是您的爱，因为那是她始终享有着的，而是您的财产给您的孙女儿。” \\n\\n 诺瓦蒂埃的眼光里露出一种不信任的表情。他显然想了解这个请求的动机，但并没有成功。 \\n\\n “阁下，”维尔福夫人说。“我可以希望您符合我的要求吗？” \\n\\n 诺瓦蒂埃表示可以。 \\n\\n “那么，阁下，”维尔福夫人又说，“我就告退了，我此时很感激，也很快活。”她向诺瓦蒂埃先生鞠躬告退。 \\n\\n 第二天，诺瓦蒂埃先生派人去请公证人：把以前的那张遗嘱销毁，重新另立一份，在那份遗嘱里，他把他的全部财产都遗赠给了瓦朗蒂娜，条件是她永远不能离开他。于是大家都传说：维尔福小姐本来就是圣·梅朗侯爵夫妇的继承人，现在又获得了她祖父的欢心，将来每年可以得到一笔三十万里弗的收入。 \\n\\n 与维尔福先生家里解除婚约的同时，基督山已去拜访过一次马尔塞夫伯爵；然后，马尔塞夫伯爵为了表示他对腾格拉尔的尊敬，他穿上了中将制服，挂上了他的全部勋章，这样打扮好以后，就吩咐人备上他最健壮的马匹，赶到安顿大马路。腾格拉尔正核算他的月帐，如果有人想在他高兴的时候去找他，现在恰好不是最好的时机。一看到他的老朋友，腾格拉尔就做出他那种庄重的神气，四平八稳地在他的安乐椅里摆好架子。马尔塞夫平时十分骄矜拘执，这一次却面带笑容，以殷勤的态度向银行家问候；由于确信他的提议对方一定肯接受，他就省去一切外交辞令，开门见山地说起下文。 \\n\\n “嗯，男爵，”他说，“我总算来了，自从我们的计划议定以后，已经过去相当多的时间了，可那些计划到现在还没有实行呢。” \\n\\n 马尔塞夫以为对方那种冷淡的态度是因为他自己不开口造成的，而现在他说了这句话，银行家的面孔一定会放松起来；然而恰好相反，让他大感惊奇的是，那张面孔竟然更加严肃无情了。 \\n\\n “您指的是哪一件事情，伯爵阁下？”腾格拉尔说，好象他一直没猜出将军话里的含义似的。 \\n\\n “啊！”马尔塞夫说，“看来您是一个很讲究形式的人，我亲爱的先生，您提醒我不应该免除古板的仪式。我请您原谅，但因为我只有一个儿子，而且又是我生平第一次打算给他娶亲，所以我还是个学徒的生手，好吧，我愿意加以改进。”于是马尔塞夫带着一个勉强的微笑站起身来，向腾格拉尔深深地鞠躬，说：“男爵阁下，我很荣幸地为我儿子阿尔贝·马尔塞夫子爵来向您请求与欧热妮·腾格拉尔小姐结亲。” \\n\\n 然而腾格拉尔不仅不象马尔塞夫所期望的那样以热情的态度来接受这次求婚，反而眉头紧皱，仍然让伯爵站着，不请他落座，说：“伯爵阁下，在我给您一个答复以前，这件事情必须得考虑考虑。” \\n\\n “考虑考虑！”马尔塞夫说，愈加感到惊愕了，“自从我们一开始谈起这桩婚事以来，已经有八个年头了，在这八年时间里，您难道考虑得还不够吗？” \\n\\n “伯爵阁下，”银行家说，“有些事情我们原以为是决定了，但每天发生的事使我们不得不随机应变。” \\n\\n “我不明白您的意思，男爵阁下。”马尔塞夫说。 \\n\\n “我的意思是，阁下——在最近这两星期里，发生了一些我料想不到的事情——” \\n\\n “请原谅，”马尔塞夫说，“但我们是在演戏吗？” \\n\\n “演戏？” \\n\\n “是的，因为很象在演戏，我们把话说得更直截了当点儿吧，尽量互相了解对方的意思。” \\n\\n “那正是我所希望的。” \\n\\n “您见过基督山先生了，是不是？” \\n\\n “我常常见到他，”腾格拉尔挺直了身子说。“他是我非常亲密的朋友。” \\n\\n “在您和他最近谈话的时候，您说，我对这件婚事的态度不够坚决，好象把它淡忘了。” \\n\\n “我确实这么说过。” \\n\\n “好吧，我现在来了。您看，我既没有淡忘，也没有不坚决的意思，因为我现在来提醒您的诺言了。” \\n\\n 腾格拉尔不作答。 \\n\\n “难道您这么快就改变了主意，”马尔塞夫又说，“或者您是想让我再三向您恳求，以我的屈辱来取乐吗？” \\n\\n 腾格拉尔觉得谈话继续这样进行下去，与他就不再有利了，于是就改变口吻，对马尔塞夫说：“伯爵阁下，您有权对我的含蓄表示吃惊——这一点我承认——而我向您保证，我用这种态度对待您，于我也觉得十分别扭。但相信我，在我说那句话的时候，我实在也是由于万不得已。” \\n\\n “这些话都听上去空空洞洞的，我亲爱的先生，”马尔塞夫说。“这些话也许可以让一个萍水相逢的朋友感到满足，但马尔塞夫伯爵却并不是一个萍水相逢的朋友。他以这样的身份去拜访另外一个人，要求对方履行诺言的时候，如果这个人不能履行他自己的诺言，那么他起码应该提出一个充分的理由。” \\n\\n 腾格拉尔是一个懦夫，但他在表面上却不愿意显得如此；马尔塞夫刚才使用的那种口吻把他惹怒了。“我的举动并不是没有充分的理由。”他答道。 \\n\\n “您的意思是什么呢？” \\n\\n “我的意思是，我有一个很充分的理由，但却不好明说。” \\n\\n “总而言之，您一定要明白，我对于你的沉默不会感到满意，但至少有一点显而易见的——就是您不想和我的家庭联姻。” \\n\\n “不，阁下，”腾格拉尔说，“我只是想推迟我的决定而已。” \\n\\n “而您真的这么自以为是，以为我竟可以随着您反复无常，低三下四地等您回心转意吗？” \\n\\n “那么，伯爵阁下，如果您不愿意等待的话，我们就只好就算从来没有谈到过这些事情好了。” \\n\\n 伯爵的脾气本来就傲慢急躁，为了阻止自己爆发出怒气，他紧紧把嘴唇咬住，直到咬出血，可是，他明白在目前这种状态下，遭嘲笑的一定是他，所以他本来已向客厅门口跨出了几步，但一转念，又回来。一片阴云掠过他的额头，抹去了脑门上的怒气，剩下一种淡淡的不安的痕迹。“我亲爱的腾格拉尔，”他说，“我们相识已经很多年了，所以我们应该互相尊重对方的脾气。您应该向我说明一下，我也应该知道我的儿子为什么失去了您的欢心，这本来是很公平的。” \\n\\n “那并不是因为对子爵本人有什么恶感，我能告诉您的仅此而已，阁下。”腾格拉尔回答，他一看到马尔塞夫软下来了一点，就马上又恢复了他那种傲慢的态度。 \\n\\n “那么您对谁产生了恶感呢？”马尔塞夫脸色发白，音调都变了。 \\n\\n 伯爵脸上的表情并没有瞒过银行家的眼睛；他用比以前更加坚定的眼神盯住对方，说：“您最好还是不要勉强我说得更明白吧。” \\n\\n 伯爵气得浑身颤抖，他极力克制住自己的狂怒，说：“我有权要您必须向我解释清楚。是不是马尔塞夫夫人不讨你喜欢？是不是您觉得我的财产不够，是不是因为我的政见和您不一致？” \\n\\n “绝不是那一类的事，阁下，”腾格拉尔答道，“如果是那样，那就只能怪我自己了，因为这些事情在一开始讨论婚约的时候我就知道。不，不要再追究原因了吧。我真感到很惭愧，让您这样作严格的自我检讨。我们暂且先不提这件事，采取中和的办法——就是，放一放再说，不算破裂也不算成约，用不着忙。我的女儿才十七岁，令郎才二十一岁。在我们等待的过程中，时间自然会促使事情不断地发展。晚上看东西只觉得一片黑暗模糊，但在晨光中看却就太清楚了。有的时候，一天之间，最残酷的诽谤会突然从天而降。” \\n\\n “诽谤，这是您说的吗，阁下？”马尔塞夫脸色顿时灰白，喊道。“难道有人敢造我谣？” \\n\\n “伯爵阁下，我已经告诉过您了，我认为最好是不要做什么解释。” \\n\\n “那么，阁下，我就耐心地忍受遭您拒绝的屈辱吗？” \\n\\n “这件事在我更是痛苦，阁下——是的，我比您感到更加痛苦，因为别人都知道我要跟您高攀，而一次婚约的破裂，女方所受的损害总比男方要大。” \\n\\n “行了，阁下，”马尔塞夫说，“这件事情我们不必再说了。” \\n\\n 于是他气冲冲地紧抓着他的手套走出房间。 \\n\\n 腾格拉尔注意到：在这次谈话的过程中，马尔塞夫自始至终不敢问是不是因为他自己，腾格拉尔才放弃他的诺言。 \\n\\n 那天晚上，腾格拉尔和几位朋友商量了很长时间；卡瓦尔康蒂先生则在客厅里陪着太太小姐，他最后一个离开那位银行家的家。 \\n\\n 第二天早晨，腾格拉尔一醒过来就找来报纸。报纸拿来了。他把其他三四份放在一边，拿起《大公报》，也就是波尚主编的那份报。他急忙忙地撕掉封套，慌慌张张地打开那份报纸，不屑一顾地掀过“巴黎大事”版，翻到杂项消息栏，带着一个恶毒的微笑把目光停驻在一段以“亚尼纳通讯”开始的消息上。“好极了！”腾格拉尔在看完那一段消息后说，“这儿有一小段关于弗尔南多上校的文字，这一段文字，如果我没有弄错的话，可以省掉我一番劲儿，免得再跟马尔塞夫伯爵来解释了。” \\n\\n 与此同时——就是说，在早晨九点钟，阿尔贝·马尔塞夫穿上一套笔挺的黑制服，激动地来到香榭丽舍大道去拜访基督山，但当他草草地问伯爵在不在家的时候，门房告诉他说，大人已经在半小时前出去了。 \\n\\n “他带没带巴浦斯汀去？” \\n\\n “没有，子爵阁下。” \\n\\n “那么，叫他来，我要跟他说几句话。” \\n\\n 门房去找那位贴身跟班，一会儿就跟他一起回来了。 \\n\\n “我的好朋友，”阿尔贝说，“请原谅我的冒昧，但我很想从你这儿知道你的主人是不是真出去了。” \\n\\n “他真的出去了，阁下。”巴浦斯汀答道。 \\n\\n “出去了？既使对我也是这样说？” \\n\\n “我知道主人一向十分高兴地见到子爵阁下，”巴浦斯汀说，“所以我绝不会把您当作普通客人看待。” \\n\\n “你说得对，我现在有一件非常要紧的事情想见见他。你说他是不是要很久才能回来？” \\n\\n “不，我想不会，因为他吩咐在十点钟给他备好早餐。” \\n\\n “好吧，我在香榭丽舍大道上转一转，十点钟的时候再回来。在这个期间，如果伯爵阁下回来了，你请他不要再出去，等着见我，行不行？” \\n\\n “我一定代为转达，阁下。”巴浦斯汀说。 \\n\\n 阿尔贝把他的马车留在伯爵门口，准备徒步去转圈儿。当他经过浮维斯巷的时候，他好象看到伯爵的马停在高塞射击房的门口，他走过去，认出了那个车夫。“伯爵阁下在里面射击吗？”马尔塞夫说。 \\n\\n “是的，先生。”车夫回答。 \\n\\n 他正说着，阿尔贝听到两三下手枪响声。他往里面走，遇到一位射击房里的侍者。“对不起，子爵阁下，”那个孩子说，“您等一下好不好？” \\n\\n “为什么，菲力？”阿尔贝问。他是那儿的老顾客，不明白为什么这次要阻止他进去。 \\n\\n “因为现在房子里的那位先生不愿意有人打扰他，他从来不在外人面前练枪的。” \\n\\n “连你也不许去吗？那么谁给他上子弹？” \\n\\n “他的仆人。” \\n\\n “一个努力比亚人吗？” \\n\\n “一个黑人。” \\n\\n “那么，是他了。” \\n\\n “你认识这位先生的吗？” \\n\\n “是的，我就是来找他的，他是我的朋友。” \\n\\n “噢！那又是一回事了。我马上去告诉他，说您来了。”于是菲力在他自己好奇心的驱动下走进射击房，没过一会儿后，基督山出现在门槛上了。 \\n\\n “我亲爱的伯爵，”阿尔贝说，“请原谅我跟踪您到了这里，我必须先跟您说，这种失礼的行为不是您仆人的过错，只怪我自己。我到您府上，他们告诉我说，您出去了，但十点钟回来吃早餐。我打算散步散到十点钟，不想，看见了您的车马。” \\n\\n “您刚才说这一通，让我倒希望你是准备来和我一起吃早餐的。” \\n\\n “不，谢谢您，我现在想的不是早餐，而是别的事情。那顿饭我们也许可以迟一些，等心情更恶劣了再吃。” \\n\\n “您在说些什么错话呀？” \\n\\n “我今天要跟人决斗。” \\n\\n “您？为什么？” \\n\\n “我要去跟人决斗——” \\n\\n “好了，我明白。可为什么事吵起来的呢？决斗的原因多得很，您知道。” \\n\\n “我决斗是为了名誉。” \\n\\n “哎呀！那可是一件很严重的事情了。” \\n\\n “严重得我来请求您帮我一个忙。” \\n\\n “帮什么忙？” \\n\\n “做我的陪证人。” \\n\\n “这是件非寻常的事情，我们不要在这儿说了，回家以后再说吧。阿里，给我拿一点水来。” \\n\\n 伯爵卷起袖子，走进那间专供练习射击的先生们练习完后洗手的小耳房里。 \\n\\n “请进，子爵阁下，”菲力小声说，“我给您看一件滑稽事儿。”马尔塞夫进去，见到墙上钉着的不是普通的靶子，而是几张纸牌。阿尔贝远看以为那是一整套的纸牌，因为他可以从Ａ数到十。 \\n\\n “啊！啊！”阿尔贝说，“我看您是在准备玩纸牌了。” \\n\\n “不，”伯爵说，“我是在制造一套纸牌。” \\n\\n “怎么回事？”阿尔贝说。 \\n\\n “您看到的那些牌实际上都是Ａ和二，但我的枪弹把它们变成三、五、七、八、九和十。” \\n\\n 阿尔贝走近去看。果然，纸牌上子弹穿过的地方极其准确，行次的距离都符合规定。马尔塞夫朝靶子走过去的时候，半路上又拾到两三只燕子，它们是被伯爵打死的，因为它们鲁莽地飞进伯爵的手枪射程。 \\n\\n “哎呀！”马尔塞夫说。 \\n\\n “您叫我有什么办法呢？，我亲爱的子爵？”基督山一面用阿里递来的毛巾擦手，一面说。“我总得在空闲的时间找些事儿做做呀。过来吧，我等着您呢。” \\n\\n 于是他们一起走进基督山的双轮马车。几分钟后，那辆马车就把他们拉到三十号门口。基督山领着阿尔贝到他的书斋里，指着一个位子让他坐下，他自己也找了一个位子坐下来。“现在我们平心静气地把事情来说一说吧，”他说。 \\n\\n “您也看得出，我是相当平心静气的了。”阿尔贝说。 \\n\\n “您想跟谁决斗？” \\n\\n “波尚。” \\n\\n “你们不是朋友吗？” \\n\\n “当然喽，决斗的对手总是朋友。” \\n\\n “我想你们这次发生争吵总有原因的吧？” \\n\\n “当然有！” \\n\\n “他把您怎么了？” \\n\\n “昨天晚上，他的报纸上——还是等一等，您自己去看吧。”于是阿尔贝把那份报纸递给伯爵。伯爵念道：“亚尼纳通讯：我们现在听说到一件至今大家还不知道，或者至少还没有公布过的事实。防护本市的城堡，是被阿里·铁贝林总督非常信任的法国军官弗尔南多出卖给土耳其人的。” \\n\\n “嗯，”基督山说，“这段消息有什么值得你恼怒的呢？” \\n\\n “有什么值得我恼怒的吗？” \\n\\n
