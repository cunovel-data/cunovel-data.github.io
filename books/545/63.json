{"id":43931,"no":63,"title":"Chapter 68 A Summer Ball","content":"THE SAME DAY during the interview between Madame Danglars and the procureur, a travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed through the gateway of No. 27, and stopped in the yard. In a moment the door was opened, and Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her son\u0027s arm. Albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his toilet, drove to the Champs Elysées, to the house of Monte Cristo. The count received him with his habitual smile. It was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man\u0027s favor. Those who would, as it were, force a passage to his heart, found an impassable barrier. Morcerf, who ran towards him with open arms, was chilled as he drew near, in spite of the friendly smile, and simply held out his hand. Monte Cristo shook it coldly, according to his invariable practice. \"Here I am, dear count.\" \n \"Welcome home again.\" \n \"I arrived an hour since.\" \n \"From Dieppe?\" \n \"No, from Tréport.\" \n \"Indeed?\" \n \"And I have come at once to see you.\" \n \"That is extremely kind of you,\" said Monte Cristo with a tone of perfect indifference. \n \"And what is the news?\" \n \"You should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.\" \n \"I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for me?\" \n \"Had you commissioned me?\" said Monte Cristo, feigning uneasiness. \n \"Come, come,\" said Albert, \"do not assume so much indifference. It is said, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at Tréport, I felt the electric shock; you have either been working for me or thinking of me.\" \n \"Possibly,\" said Monte Cristo, \"I have indeed thought of you, but the magnetic wire I was guiding acted, indeed, without my knowledge.\" \n \"Indeed? Pray tell me how it happened?\" \n \"Willingly. M. Danglars dined with me.\" \n \"I know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and I left town.\" \n \"But he met here M. Andrea Cavalcanti.\" \n \"Your Italian prince?\" \n \"Not so fast; M. Andrea only calls himself count.\" \n \"Calls himself, do you say?\" \n \"Yes, calls himself.\" \n \"Is he not a count?\" \n \"What can I know of him? He calls himself so. I, of course, give him the same title, and every one else does likewise.\" \n \"What a strange man you are! What next? You say M. Danglars dined here?\" \n \"Yes, with Count Cavalcanti, the marquis his father, Madame Danglars, M. and Madame de Villefort,--charming people,--M. Debray, Maximilian Morrel, and M. de Chateau-Renaud.\" \n \"Did they speak of me?\" \n \"Not a word.\" \n \"So much the worse.\" \n \"Why so? I thought you wished them to forget you?\" \n \"If they did not speak of me, I am sure they thought about me, and I am in despair.\" \n \"How will that affect you, since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the number here who thought of you? Truly, she might have thought of you at home.\" \n \"I have no fear of that; or, if she did, it was only in the same way in which I think of her.\" \n \"Touching sympathy! So you hate each other?\" said the count. \n \"Listen,\" said Morcerf--\"if Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families, I am ready to agree to the arrangement. In a word, Mademoiselle Danglars would make a charming mistress--but a wife--diable!\" \n \"And this,\" said Monte Cristo, \"is your opinion of your intended spouse?\" \n \"Yes; it is rather unkind, I acknowledge, but it is true. But as this dream cannot be realized, since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my lawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and music within ten paces of me, and that for my whole life, it frightens me. One may forsake a mistress, but a wife,--good heavens! There she must always be; and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful.\" \n \"You are difficult to please, viscount.\" \n \"Yes, for I often wish for what is impossible.\" \n \"What is that?\" \n \"To find such a wife as my father found.\" Monte Cristo turned pale, and looked at Albert, while playing with some magnificent pistols. \n \"Your father was fortunate, then?\" said he. \n \"You know my opinion of my mother, count; look at her,--still beautiful, witty, more charming than ever. For any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at Tréport, it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom, while I return, more contented, more peaceful--shall I say more poetic!--than if I had taken Queen Mab or Titania as my companion.\" \n \"That is an overwhelming demonstration, and you would make every one vow to live a single life.\" \n \"Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars. Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it? The diamond which glittered in the window at Marle\u0027s or Fossin\u0027s shines with more splendor when it is our own; but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another, and still must retain the one that is inferior, do you not know what we have to endure?\" \n \"Worldling,\" murmured the count. \n \"Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugénie perceives I am but a pitiful atom, with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions.\" Monte Cristo smiled. \"One plan occurred to me,\" continued Albert; \"Franz likes all that is eccentric; I tried to make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars; but in spite of four letters, written in the most alluring style, he invariably answered: \u0027My eccentricity may be great, but it will not make me break my promise.\u0027\" \n \"That is what I call devoted friendship, to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself.\" Albert smiled.--\"Apropos,\" continued he, \"Franz is coming soon, but it will not interest you; you dislike him, I think?\" \n \"I?\" said Monte Cristo; \"my dear Viscount, how have you discovered that I did not like M. Franz! I like every one.\" \n \"And you include me in the expression every one--many thanks!\" \n \"Let us not mistake,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I love every one as God commands us to love our neighbor, as Christians; but I thoroughly hate but a few. Let us return to M. Franz d\u0027Epinay. Did you say he was coming?\" \n \"Yes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to get Mademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle Eugénie settled. It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise one\u0027s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done.\" \n \"But M. d\u0027Epinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently.\" \n \"Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white tie, and speaks of his family. He entertains a very high opinion of M. and Madame de Villefort.\" \n \"Which they deserve, do they not?\" \n \"I believe they do. M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man.\" \n \"There is, then, one,\" said Monte Cristo, \"whom you do not condemn like poor Danglars?\" \n \"Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps,\" replied Albert, laughing. \n \"Indeed, my dear sir,\" said Monte Cristo, \"you are revoltingly foppish.\" \n \"I foppish? how do you mean?\" \n \"Yes; pray take a cigar, and cease to defend yourself, and to struggle to escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars. Let things take their course; perhaps you may not have to retract.\" \n \"Bah,\" said Albert, staring. \n \"Doubtless, my dear viscount, you will not be taken by force; and seriously, do you wish to break off your engagement?\" \n \"I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so.\" \n \"Then make yourself quite easy. M. Danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end.\" \n \"Am I, indeed, so happy?\" said Albert, who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow. \"But, my dear count, has M. Danglars any reason?\" \n \"Ah, there is your proud and selfish nature. You would expose the self-love of another with a hatchet, but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle.\" \n \"But yet M. Danglars appeared\"-- \n \"Delighted with you, was he not? Well, he is a man of bad taste, and is still more enchanted with another. I know not whom; look and judge for yourself.\" \n \"Thank you, I understand. But my mother--no, not my mother; I mistake--my father intends giving a ball.\" \n \"A ball at this season?\" \n \"Summer balls are fashionable.\" \n \"If they were not, the countess has only to wish it, and they would become so.\" \n \"You are right; You know they are select affairs; those who remain in Paris in July must be true Parisians. Will you take charge of our invitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti?\" \n \"When will it take place?\" \n \"On Saturday.\" \n \"M. Cavalcanti\u0027s father will be gone.\" \n \"But the son will be here; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti?\" \n \"I do not know him, viscount.\" \n \"You do not know him?\" \n \"No, I never saw him until a few days since, and am not responsible for him.\" \n \"But you receive him at your house?\" \n \"That is another thing: he was recommended to me by a good abbé, who may be deceived. Give him a direct invitation, but do not ask me to present him. If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars, you would accuse me of intrigue, and would be challenging me,--besides, I may not be there myself.\" \n \"Where?\" \n \"At your ball.\" \n \"Why should you not be there?\" \n \"Because you have not yet invited me.\" \n \"But I come expressly for that purpose.\" \n \"You are very kind, but I may be prevented.\" \n \"If I tell you one thing, you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments.\" \n \"Tell me what it is.\" \n \"My mother begs you to come.\" \n \"The Comtesse de Morcerf?\" said Monte Cristo, starting. \n \"Ah, count,\" said Albert, \"I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely to me, and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I spoke just now thrill within you, you must be entirely devoid of them, for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else.\" \n \"You have talked of me?\" \n \"Yes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!\" \n \"Then I am also a puzzle to your mother? I should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination.\" \n \"A problem, my dear count, for every one--for my mother as well as others; much studied, but not solved, you still remain an enigma, do not fear. My mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved. I believe, while the Countess G----takes you for Lord Ruthven, my mother imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain. The first opportunity you have, confirm her in her opinion; it will be easy for you, as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other.\" \n \"I thank you for the warning,\" said the count; \"I shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions.\" \n \"You will, then, come on Saturday?\" \n \"Yes, since Madame de Morcerf invites me.\" \n \"You are very kind.\" \n \"Will M. Danglars be there?\" \n \"He has already been invited by my father. We shall try to persuade the great d\u0027Aguesseau, [1] M. de Villefort, to come, but have not much hope of seeing him.\" \n \"\u0027Never despair of anything,\u0027 says the proverb.\" \n \"Do you dance, count?\" \n \"I dance?\" \n \"Yes, you; it would not be astonishing.\" \n \"That is very well before one is over forty. No, I do not dance, but I like to see others do so. Does Madame de Morcerf dance?\" \n \"Never; you can talk to her, she so delights in your conversation.\" \n \"Indeed?\" \n \"Yes, truly; and I assure you. You are the only man of whom I have heard her speak with interest.\" Albert rose and took his hat; the count conducted him to the door. \"I have one thing to reproach myself with,\" said he, stopping Albert on the steps. \"What is it?\" \n \"I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars.\" \n \"On the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him.\" \n \"I am glad to be reassured on that point. Apropos, when do you aspect M. d\u0027Epinay?\" \n \"Five or six days hence at the latest.\" \n \"And when is he to be married?\" \n \"Immediately on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran.\" \n \"Bring him to see me. Although you say I do not like him, I assure you I shall be happy to see him.\" \n \"I will obey your orders, my lord.\" \n \"Good-by.\" \"Until Saturday, when I may expect you, may I not?\" \n \"Yes, I promised you.\" The Count watched Albert, waving his hand to him. When he had mounted his phaeton, Monte Cristo turned, and seeing Bertuccio, \"What news?\" said he. \"She went to the Palais,\" replied the steward. \n \"Did she stay long there?\" \n \"An hour and a half.\" \n \"Did she return home?\" \n \"Directly.\" \n 就在腾格拉尔夫人去见检察官那天，一辆旅行马车驶进了海尔达路，穿过了二十七号大门，在园子里停了下来。不一会儿，车门打开，马尔塞夫夫人扶着她儿子的肩膀下车。阿尔贝不久就离开了她，吩咐套马，在打扮了一番之后，就驱车到了香榭丽舍大道，基督山的家里。伯爵带着他那种习惯性的微笑出来迎接他。说来奇怪，伯爵这个人，似乎谁都无法进一步和他密切关系。凡是想和他结成所谓‘知己’的人，会遇到一重无法逾越的障碍。马尔塞夫本来是张开着双臂向他奔过去的，但一到跟前，他的心就冷了，尽管对方的脸上挂着友好的微笑，他却只敢伸出一只手去。基督山以他那不变的习惯，把那只手冷淡地握了一下。 \n “唉！”阿尔贝说，“我来啦，亲爱的伯爵。” \n “欢迎你回来！” \n “我是一个钟头以前才到的。” \n “是从迪埃普来的吗？” \n “不，从的黎港来。” \n “啊，真的！” \n “我第一个就来拜访您了。” \n “您真太好了。”基督山用一种完全无所谓的口吻说道。 \n “唉！情况怎么样？” \n “您不该向一个客居他乡的外国人打听消息。” \n “我知道，但所谓的打听消息，我的意思是您有没有为我办了什么事？” \n “您曾委托过我办什么事吗？”基督山装出一种很不安的样子说。 \n “嘿，嘿！”阿尔贝说，“别假装不知道了。人家说，人隔两地，情通一脉——嗯，在的黎港的时候，我曾感到一阵触电似的麻木。您不是为我办了一些什么事，便是在想念我。” \n “可能吧，”基督山说，“我的确曾想念过您，但我必须承认，那股电流虽然或许是我发出去的，但我自己却并不知道。” \n “真的！请告诉我是怎么回事？” \n “事情很简单，腾格拉尔先生到我这里来吃了一次饭。” \n “这我知道，正是为了避免遇到他，家母和我才离开巴黎的。” \n “但同席的还有安德烈·卡瓦尔康蒂先生。” \n “您那位意大利王子吗？” \n “别那么夸大，安德烈先生还在自称子爵呢。” \n “他自称，您说？” \n “是的，他自称。” \n “那么他不是个子爵喽？” \n “哦！我怎么知道？他这样自称，我当然也就这样称呼他，人人也都这样称呼他。” \n “您这个人真是怪！还有什么？您说腾格拉尔先生在这儿吃过饭？” \n “是的。” \n “还有您那位安德烈·卡瓦尔康蒂子爵？” \n “还有卡瓦尔康蒂子爵，他的侯爵父亲，腾格拉尔夫人，维尔福先生夫妇——难得的贵宾——德布雷，马西米兰·莫雷尔，还有谁，等一等——啊！夏多·勒诺先生。” \n “他们提到过我吗？” \n “丝毫没有。” \n “那真糟。” \n “为什么？我好象记得您是希望他们忘记您的？” \n “假如他们没有提到过我，我便可以确定他们曾想到我，我很失望。” \n “只要那些想念您的人里面没有腾格拉尔小姐，对您又有什么影响呢？不错，她或许在家里想念您。” \n “那我倒不怕，假如她的确想念我的话，那也只是象我对她一样的想念而已。” \n “心心相印！那么你们是互相讨厌罗？”伯爵说。 \n “听我说！”马尔塞夫说。“假如腾格拉尔小姐能不使我受殉道者的痛苦，不必经过我们两家的正式婚姻手续来报答我的情谊，那对我可就再好不过了。一句话，腾格拉尔小姐可以做个可爱的情妇，但做太太，糟透了！” \n “您就是这样看待您那位未来的太太的吗，”基督山问道。 \n “是的，说得更残酷些，这是真的，至少是实情。可是这个梦是无法实现的，因为腾格拉尔小姐必定要作我的太太的。也就是说，一定会和我住在一起。在离我十步路之内对我唱歌、作曲或玩乐器的。我想起来就怕。我们可以抛弃一个情妇，但对于一位太太，老天爷！那就是一回事了。那是永久性的。不管她在身边或在远处，总是永久的东西。一想到腾格拉尔小姐要永远和我在一起，即使大家隔得远远的那也够可怕的。” \n “您真难讨好，子爵。” \n “是的，因为我希望能实现不可能的事情。” \n “什么事？” \n “找到一位象家母那样的妻子。” \n 基督山的脸色顿时变白了，他望着阿尔贝，手里在玩弄着那支华丽的手枪。 \n “那么令尊很幸福罗？”他说道。 \n “您知道我对家母的看法，伯爵。您看看她，还很美丽，很有活力，象以前一样。要是别的当儿子的陪他的母亲到的黎港去住四天，他肯定会觉得枯燥，厌烦，但我陪了她四天，却比陪伴玛琵仙后［民间传说中的仙女，莎士比亚戏剧《罗密欧与朱丽叶》中有详细描写。——译注］或狄达尼亚仙后［莎士比亚戏剧《仲夏夜之梦》中人物。——译注］更满意，更宁静，更——我可以这样说吗？——富于诗意。” \n “那真是十全十美到了极点，您会使人人都发誓要过独身生活啦。” \n “正是为这个原因，”马尔塞夫又说，“由于知道世界上确有十全十美的女子，所以我才并不急于娶腾格拉尔小姐。您有没有注意到，一件东西，当我们得到它的时候，它的价值就会增加？在珠宝店的橱窗里闪闪发光的钻石，当它到了我们自己手里的时候，光彩就更灿烂了，但假如我们不得不承认还有更好的，却依旧保留着较次点的，您知不知道那会让人多么痛苦？” \n “真是欲海无边哪！”伯爵喃喃地说道。 \n “所以，假如欧热妮小姐能理解人只是个可怜的小东西，她有几百万，而我连几十万都没有，那我就高兴了。” \n 基督山微笑了一下。 \n “我曾经想到过一个计划，”阿尔贝继续说，“凡是怪癖的东西，弗兰兹都喜欢。我想设法使他爱上腾格拉尔小姐，但尽管写了四封最具诱惑力的信，他都仍一成不变地回答：‘我的怪癖虽大，但她却不能使我破坏我的诺言。’” \n “这就是我所谓的那真诚的友谊，您自己不愿意娶的人，却拿来推荐给别人。” \n 阿尔贝微笑了一下。“顺便告诉您一下，”他又说，“弗兰兹就要来了。但您对那个消息是会感兴趣的。您不喜欢他是吗？” \n “我！”基督山说，“我亲爱的子爵，您怎么会想到我不喜欢弗兰兹先生呢？我喜欢每一个人。” \n “您把我也包括在这‘每一个人’面里了吗？谢谢！” \n “请不要误会，”基督山说，“我爱每一个人就象上帝要我们爱我们的邻居那样。那是基督教意义上的爱，但我也有少数几个极其痛恨的人。我们还是回过头来谈弗兰兹·伊皮奈先生吧。您说他就要回来了？” \n “是的，是维尔福先生召他回来的，维尔福先生显然是急于要把瓦朗蒂娜小姐嫁出去，正如腾格拉尔先生想看到欧热妮小姐早日出阁一样。有一个长大了的女儿在家里，做父亲的一定非常为难，不把她们弄走，他们就象是会发烧一样，每分钟脉搏要跳九十下。” \n “但伊皮奈先生不象您，他耐心地承受了他的不幸。” \n “岂止如此，他谈起那件事来时很严肃，正襟危坐，好象在谈论他自己的家里人似的。而且，他极其尊敬维尔福先生夫妇。” \n “他们是值得尊敬的，是不是？” \n “我相信是的。维尔福先生总是被人看作是一个严厉但却公正的人。” \n “那么，”基督山说，“总算有一个人不象那个可怜的腾格拉尔那样受您责难了。” \n “或许那是因为我不必被迫娶他女儿的缘故吧。”阿尔贝回答，大笑起来。 \n “真的，我亲爱的先生，”基督山说，“您太自负了。” \n “我自负？” \n “是的，抽一支雪茄吧。” \n “很愿意。我怎么自负呢？” \n “咦，因为您在这儿拼命为自己辩护，要避免腾格拉尔小姐。但让事情去自然发展吧，或许首先撤退的并不是您。” \n “什么！”阿尔贝瞪着眼睛说道。 \n “毫无疑问，子爵阁下，他们是不会强迫您就范的。来吧，正正经经地说吧，您不想废除你们的婚约？” \n “假若能够，我愿意为此付出十万法郎。” \n “那么您可以大大地高兴一番。腾格拉尔先生愿意出双倍于那个数目的钱来达到这一目的。” \n “难道我真的这样幸福吗？”阿尔贝说，他的脸上依旧浮过了一片几乎难以觉察的阴云。“但是，我亲爱的伯爵，腾格拉尔先生有理由这样做吧？” \n “啊！您的骄傲和自私的心里显露出来啦。您可以用一把斧头去攻击别人的自尊心，但假如您自己的自尊心被一根小针刺了一下，您就畏缩了起来。” \n “不是的，但依我看，腾格拉尔先生似乎——” \n “应该喜欢您，是不是，嗯？他的鉴赏能力不高，他好象喜欢另外一个人。” \n “是谁？” \n “我也不知道，您自己去研究和判断吧。” \n “谢谢您，我懂了。听着：家母——不，不是家母，我弄错了——家父准备要开一次舞会。” \n “在这个季节开舞会？” \n “夏季跳舞会是很时兴的。” \n “即使不然，只要一经伯爵夫人提侣，就会时兴起来的。” \n “您说得不错。您知道，这是清一色的舞会——凡是七月里留在巴黎的人，一定是真正的巴黎人。您可不可以代我们邀请两位卡瓦尔康蒂先生？” \n “哪天举行？” \n “星期六。” \n “老卡瓦尔康蒂到那时就已经走了。” \n “但他的儿子还在这儿。您可不可以邀请一下小卡瓦尔康蒂先生？” \n “我不熟悉他，子爵。” \n “您不熟悉他？” \n “不，我是在几天前才和他初次见面的，对于他的事不论从哪方面讲我都没有把握。” \n “但您请他到您的家里来吃过饭的？” \n “那是另一回事，他是一位好心肠的神甫介绍给我的，神甫或许受骗了。你直接去请他吧，别让我代替你去邀请了，假如他将来娶了腾格拉尔小姐，您就会说是我搞的阴谋，要来和我决斗的。再说，我自己也可能不去。” \n “不去哪儿？” \n “你们的舞会。” \n “您为什么不去？” \n “只有一个理由，因为您还没有邀请我。” \n “但我是特地为那项使命才来的呀。” \n “您太赏脸了，但我或许会因事受阻的。” \n “假如我告诉您一件事情，您就会排除一切障碍屈驾光临了。” \n “告诉我什么事。” \n “家母恳请您去。” \n “马尔塞夫伯爵夫人？”基督山吃了一惊。 \n “啊，伯爵，”阿尔贝说，“我向您保证，马尔塞夫夫人跟我说得很坦白，假如您没有那种我刚才提到过的远地交感的感触，那一定是您身体里根本没有这种神经，因为在过去的这四天里，我们除了你没谈论到任何别人。” \n “你们在谈论我？多谢厚爱！” \n “是的，那是您的特权，您是一个活的话题。” \n “那么，在令堂眼中，我也是一个问题吗？我还以为她很理智，不会有这种幻想呢。” \n “我亲爱的伯爵，您是每一个的问题——家母的，也是别人的，很多人研究你，但没有得出结论，您依旧还是一个谜，所以您尽管放心好了。家母老是问，您怎么这样年轻。我相信，Ｇ伯爵夫人虽然把您比做罗思文勋爵，而家母却把您看作了卡略斯特洛［卡略斯特洛（一七四三—一七九五），意大利著名骗子，后被判终身监禁。——译注］或圣日尔曼伯爵［圣日尔曼伯爵（一七八四卒），法国冒险家，为法王路易十五从事各种政治阴谋活动。——译注］。您一有机会就可以证实她的看法，这在您是很容易做到的，因为您有前者的点金石和后者的智慧。” \n “我谢谢您的提醒，”伯爵说，“我尽力去应付来自各方面的对我的揣测就是了。” \n “那么，星期六您来？” \n “来的，既然马尔塞夫夫人邀请我。” \n “您太赏脸了。” \n “腾格拉尔先生去不去？” \n “家父已经邀请他了。我们当设法去劝请那位大法官维尔福先生也来，但他可能会使我们失望的。” \n “俗话说，‘永远不要失望。’” \n “您跳舞吗，伯爵？” \n “跳舞？” \n “是的，您。这有什么可大惊小怪的？” \n “跳舞对于未满四十岁的人来说真是最合适不过了。不，我是不跳舞的，但我喜欢看别人跳。马尔塞夫夫人跳舞吗？” \n “从没跳过，您可以和她聊聊天，她非常希望能和您谈一谈。” \n “真的！” \n “是的，的确是真的，我向您保证，您是她唯一曾显示过那种好奇心的人。” \n 阿尔贝起身拿起了他的帽子，伯爵陪他到了门口。“我有一件事很后悔。”走到台阶前，他止住阿尔贝说道。 \n “行，什么事？” \n “我跟您讲到腾格拉尔的时候，有点失礼了。” \n “恰恰相反，关于他，永远用同样的态度跟我讲好了。” \n “那好！这我就放心了。顺便问一句，您认为伊皮奈先生何时候能到？” \n “最迟五六天可到。” \n “他什么时候结婚？” \n “圣·梅朗先生夫妇一到，就立刻结婚。” \n “带他来见我。尽管您说我不喜欢他，但我向您保证，我倒是高兴能见见他。” \n “遵命，爵爷。” \n “再会。” \n “星期六再会，届时我一定恭候您，希望不会落空。” \n “好的，我一定来。” \n 伯爵目送着阿尔贝上了车，阿尔贝连连向他挥手道别。当他踏上他的轻便四轮马车以后，基督山转过身来，看到了贝尔图乔。“有什么消息？”他问。 \n “她到法院去了一次。”管家回答。 \n “在那儿停留了多久？” \n “一个半钟头。” \n “她有没有回家？” \n “直接回家去了。” \n “好，我亲爱的贝尔图乔，”伯爵说，“我现在劝你去寻找一下我对你说过的诺曼底的那处小产业。” \n 贝尔图乔鞠了一躬，他所得到的这个命令正中他的下怀，所以他当天晚上就出发了。” \n \n
