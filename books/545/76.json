{"id":43944,"no":76,"title":"Chapter 81 The Room of the Retired Baker","content":"THE EVENING of the day on which the Count of Morcerf had left Danglars\u0027 house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance, M. Andrea Cavalcanti, with curled hair, mustaches in perfect order, and white gloves which fitted admirably, had entered the courtyard of the banker\u0027s house in La Chaussée d\u0027Antin. He had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing-room before he drew Danglars aside into the recess of a bow-window, and, after an ingenious preamble, related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father\u0027s departure. He acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker\u0027s family, in which he had been received as a son, and where, besides, his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in Mademoiselle Danglars. Danglars listened with the most profound attention; he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days, and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to Morcerf. He would not, however, yield immediately to the young man\u0027s request, but made a few conscientious objections. \"Are you not rather young, M. Andrea, to think of marrying?\" \n \"I think not, sir,\" replied M. Cavalcanti; \"in Italy the nobility generally marry young. Life is so uncertain, that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach.\" \n \"Well, sir,\" said Danglars, \"in case your proposals, which do me honor, are accepted by my wife and daughter, by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled? So important a negotiation should, I think, be conducted by the respective fathers of the young people.\" \n \"Sir, my father is a man of great foresight and prudence. Thinking that I might wish to settle in France, he left me at his departure, together with the papers establishing my identity, a letter promising, if he approved of my choice, 150,000 livres per annum from the day I was married. So far as I can judge, I suppose this to be a quarter of my father\u0027s revenue.\" \n \"I,\" said Danglars, \"have always intended giving my daughter 500,000 francs as her dowry; she is, besides, my sole heiress.\" \n \"All would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing. We should command an annuity of 175,000 livres. Supposing, also, I should persuade the marquis to give me my capital, which is not likely, but still is possible, we would place these two or three millions in your hands, whose talent might make it realize ten per cent.\" \n \"I never give more than four per cent, and generally only three and a half; but to my son-in-law I would give five, and we would share the profit.\" \n \"Very good, father-in-law,\" said Cavalcanti, yielding to his low-born nature, which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it. Correcting himself immediately, he said, \"Excuse me, sir; hope alone makes me almost mad,--what will not reality do?\" \n \"But,\" said Danglars,--who, on his part, did not perceive how soon the conversation, which was at first disinterested, was turning to a business transaction,--\"there is, doubtless, a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you?\" \n \"Which?\" asked the young man. \n \"That you inherit from your mother.\" \n \"Truly, from my mother, Leonora Corsinari.\" \n \"How much may it amount to?\" \n \"Indeed, sir,\" said Andrea, \"I assure you I have never given the subject a thought, but I suppose it must have been at least two millions.\" Danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure, or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up. \n \"Well, sir,\" said Andrea, bowing to the banker respectfully, \"may I hope?\" \n \"You may not only hope,\" said Danglars, \"but consider it a settled thing, if no obstacle arises on your part.\" \n \"I am, indeed, rejoiced,\" said Andrea. \n \"But,\" said Danglars thoughtfully, \"how is it that your patron, M. de Monte Cristo, did not make his proposal for you?\" Andrea blushed imperceptibly. \"I have just left the count, sir,\" said he; \"he is, doubtless, a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas. He esteems me highly. He even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property. He has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me; but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another, and he never would. I must, however, do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion, because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one. Besides, if he will do nothing officially, he will answer any questions you propose to him. And now,\" continued he, with one of his most charming smiles, \"having finished talking to the father-in-law, I must address myself to the banker.\" \n \"And what may you have to say to him?\" said Danglars, laughing in his turn. \n \"That the day after to-morrow I shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs; but the count, expecting my bachelor\u0027s revenue could not suffice for the coming month\u0027s outlay, has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs. It bears his signature, as you see, which is all-sufficient.\" \n \"Bring me a million such as that,\" said Danglars, \"I shall be well pleased,\" putting the draft in his pocket. \"Fix your own hour for to-morrow, and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs.\" \n \"At ten o\u0027clock then, if you please; I should like it early, as I am going into the country to-morrow.\" \n \"Very well, at ten o\u0027clock;, you are still at the H?tel des Princes?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n The following morning, with the banker\u0027s usual punctuality, the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man\u0027s hands as he was on the point of starting, after having left two hundred francs for Caderousse. He went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy, and returned as late as possible in the evening. But scarcely had be stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand. \"Sir,\" said he, \"that man has been here.\" \n \"What man?\" said Andrea carelessly, apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected. \n \"Him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity.\" \n \"Oh,\" said Andrea, \"my father\u0027s old servant. Well, you gave him the two hundred francs I had left for him?\" \n \"Yes, your excellency.\" Andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed. \"But,\" continued the porter, \"he would not take them.\" Andrea turned pale, but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible. \"What? he would not take them?\" said he with slight emotion. \n \"No, he wished to speak to your excellency; I told him you were gone out, and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter, which he had brought with him already sealed.\" \n \"Give it me,\" said Andrea, and he read by the light of his carriage-lamp,--\"You know where I live; I expect you tomorrow morning at nine o\u0027clock.\" \n Andrea examined it carefully, to ascertain if the letter had been opened, or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents; but it was so carefully folded, that no one could have read it, and the seal was perfect. \"Very well,\" said he. \"Poor man, he is a worthy creature.\" He left the porter to ponder on these words, not knowing which most to admire, the master or the servant. \"Take out the horses quickly, and come up to me,\" said Andrea to his groom. In two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt Caderousse\u0027s letter. The servant entered just as he had finished. \"You are about my height, Pierre,\" said he. \n \"I have that honor, your excellency.\" \n \"You had a new livery yesterday?\" \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \"I have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening, and do not wish to be known; lend me your livery till to-morrow. I may sleep, perhaps, at an inn.\" Pierre obeyed. Five minutes after, Andrea left the hotel, completely disguised, took a cabriolet, and ordered the driver to take him to the Cheval Rouge, at Picpus. The next morning he left that inn as he had left the H?tel des Princes, without being noticed, walked down the Faubourg St. Antoine, along the boulevard to Rue Ménilmontant, and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for some one of whom to make inquiry in the porter\u0027s absence. \"For whom are you looking, my fine fellow?\" asked the fruiteress on the opposite side. \n \"Monsieur Pailletin, if you please, my good woman,\" replied Andrea. \n \"A retired baker?\" asked the fruiteress. \n \"Exactly.\" \n \"He lives at the end of the yard, on the left, on the third story.\" Andrea went as she directed him, and on the third floor he found a hare\u0027s paw, which, by the hasty ringing of the bell, it was evident he pulled with considerable ill-temper. A moment after Caderousse\u0027s face appeared at the grating in the door. \"Ah, you are punctual,\" said he, as he drew back the door. \n \"Confound you and your punctuality!\" said Andrea, throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host. \n \"Come, come, my little fellow, don\u0027t be angry. See, I have thought about you--look at the good breakfast we are going to have; nothing but what you are fond of.\" Andrea, indeed, inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him, hungry as he was; it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provincial kitchens of an inferior order, added to that of dried fish, and above all, the pungent smell of musk and cloves. These odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove, and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot. In an adjoining room Andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two, two bottles of wine sealed, the one with green, the other with yellow, a supply of brandy in a decanter, and a measure of fruit in a cabbage-leaf, cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate. \n \"What do you think of it, my little fellow?\" said Caderousse. \"Ay, that smells good! You know I used to be a famous cook; do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers? You were among the first who tasted any of my dishes, and I think you relished them tolerably.\" While speaking, Caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions. \n \"But,\" said Andrea, ill-temperedly, \"by my faith, if it was only to breakfast with you, that you disturbed me, I wish the devil had taken you!\" \n \"My boy,\" said Caderousse sententiously, \"one can talk while eating. And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend? I am weeping with joy.\" He was truly crying, but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old inn-keeper of the Pont-du-Gard. \"Hold your tongue, hypocrite,\" said Andrea; \"you love me!\" \n \"Yes, I do, or may the devil take me. I know it is a weakness,\" said Caderousse, \"but it overpowers me.\" \n \"And yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick.\" \n \"Come,\" said Caderousse, wiping his large knife on his apron, \"if I did not like you, do you think I should endure the wretched life you lead me? Think for a moment. You have your servant\u0027s clothes on--you therefore keep a servant; I have none, and am obliged to prepare my own meals. You abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d\u0027h\u0026ocitc;te of the H?tel des Princes, or the Café de Paris. Well, I too could keep a servant; I too could have a tilbury; I too could dine where I like; but why do I not? Because I would not annoy my little Benedetto. Come, just acknowledge that I could, eh?\" This address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand. \"Well,\" said Andrea, \"admitting your love, why do you want me to breakfast with you?\" \n \"That I may have the pleasure of seeing you, my little fellow.\" \n \"What is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements?\" \n \"Eh, dear friend,\" said Caderousse, \"are wills ever made without codicils? But you first came to breakfast, did you not? Well, sit down, and let us begin with these pilchards, and this fresh butter; which I have put on some vine-leaves to please you, wicked one. Ah, yes; you look at my room, my four straw chairs, my images, three francs each. But what do you expect? This is not the H?tel des Princes.\" \n \"Come, you are growing discontented, you are no longer happy; you, who only wish to live like a retired baker.\" Caderousse sighed. \"Well, what have you to say? you have seen your dream realized.\" \n \"I can still say it is a dream; a retired baker, my poor Benedetto, is rich--he has an annuity.\" \n \"Well, you have an annuity.\" \n \"I have?\" \n \"Yes, since I bring you your two hundred francs.\" Caderousse shrugged his shoulders. \"It is humiliating,\" said he, \"thus to receive money given grudgingly, ---an uncertain supply which may soon fail. You see I am obliged to economize, in case your prosperity should cease. Well, my friend, fortune is inconstant, as the chaplain of the regiment said. I know your prosperity is great, you rascal; you are to marry the daughter of Danglars.\" \n \"What? of Danglars?\" \n \"Yes, to be sure; must I say Baron Danglars? I might as well say Count Benedetto. He was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding, seeing he came to mine. Yes, yes, to mine; gad, he was not so proud then,--he was an under-clerk to the good M. Morrel. I have dined many times with him and the Count of Morcerf, so you see I have some high connections and were I to cultivate them a little, we might meet in the same drawing-rooms.\" \n \"Come, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light.\" \n \"That is all very fine, Benedetto mio, but I know what I am saying. Perhaps I may one day put on my best coat, and presenting myself at the great gate, introduce myself. Meanwhile let us sit down and eat.\" Caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite, praising each dish he set before his visitor. The latter seemed to have resigned himself; he drew the corks, and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat. \"Ah, mate,\" said Caderousse, \"you are getting on better terms with your old landlord!\" \n \"Faith, yes,\" replied Andrea, whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling. \n \"So you like it, you rogue?\" \n \"So much that I wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living.\" \n \"Do you see,\" said Caderousse, \"all my happiness is marred by one thought?\" \n \"What is that?\" \n \"That I am dependent on another, I who have always gained my own livelihood honestly.\" \n \"Do not let that disturb you, I have enough for two.\" \n \"No, truly; you may believe me if you will; at the end of every month I am tormented by remorse.\" \n \"Good Caderousse!\" \n \"So much so, that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs.\" \n \"Yes, you wished to speak to me; but was it indeed remorse, tell me?\" \n \"True remorse; and, besides, an idea had struck me.\" Andrea shuddered; he always did so at Caderousse\u0027s ideas. \"It is miserable--do you see?--always to wait till the end of the month.--\"Oh,\" said Andrea philosophically, determined to watch his companion narrowly, \"does not life pass in waiting? Do I, for instance, fare better? Well, I wait patiently, do I not?\" \n \"Yes; because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs, you expect five or six thousand, perhaps ten, perhaps even twelve, for you take care not to let any one know the utmost. Down there, you always had little presents and Christmas-boxes which you tried to hide from your poor friend Caderousse. Fortunately he is a cunning fellow, that friend Caderousse.\" \n \"There you are beginning again to ramble, to talk again and again of the past! But what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again?\" \n \"Ah, you are only one and twenty, and can forget the past; I am fifty, and am obliged to recollect it. But let us return to business.\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"I was going to say, if I were in your place\"-- \n \"Well.\" \n \"I would realize\"-- \n \"How would you realize?\" \n \"I would ask for six months\u0027 in advance, under pretence of being able to purchase a farm, then with my six months I would decamp.\" \n \"Well, well,\" said Andrea, \"that isn\u0027t a bad idea.\" \n \"My dear friend,\" said Caderousse, \"eat of my bread, and take my advice; you will be none the worse off, physically or morally.\" \n \"But,\" said Andrea, \"why do you not act on the advice you gave me? Why do you not realize a six months\u0027, a year\u0027s advance even, and retire to Brussels? Instead of living the retired baker, you might live as a bankrupt, using his privileges; that would be very good.\" \n \"But how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs?\" \n \"Ah, Caderousse,\" said Andrea, \"how covetous you are! Two months ago you were dying with hunger.\" \n \"The appetite grows by what it feeds on,\" said Caderousse, grinning and showing his teeth, like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling. \"And,\" added he, biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread, \"I have formed a plan.\" Caderousse\u0027s plans alarmed Andrea still more than his ideas; ideas were but the germ, the plan was reality. \"Let me see your plan; I dare say it is a pretty one.\" \n \"Why not? Who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of M ----! eh? was it not I? and it was no bad one I believe, since here we are!\" \n \"I do not say,\" replied Andrea, \"that you never make a good one; but let us see your plan.\" \n \"Well,\" pursued Caderousse, \"can you without expending one sou, put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs? No, fifteen thousand are not enough,--I cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs.\" \n \"No,\" replied Andrea, dryly, \"no, I cannot.\" \n \"I do not think you understand me,\" replied Caderousse, calmly; \"I said without your laying out a sou.\" \n \"Do you want me to commit a robbery, to spoil all my good fortune--and yours with mine--and both of us to be dragged down there again?\" \n \"It would make very little difference to me,\" said Caderousse, \"if I were retaken, I am a poor creature to live alone, and sometimes pine for my old comrades; not like you, heartless creature, who would be glad never to see them again.\" Andrea did more than tremble this time, he turned pale. \n \"Come, Caderousse, no nonsense!\" said he. \n \"Don\u0027t alarm yourself, my little Benedetto, but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance, and I will contrive it.\" \n \"Well, I\u0027ll see--I\u0027ll try to contrive some way,\" said Andrea. \n \"Meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs, my little fellow? I have a fancy, and mean to get a housekeeper.\" \n \"Well, you shall have your five hundred francs,\" said Andrea; \"but it is very hard for me, my poor Caderousse--you take advantage\"-- \n \"Bah,\" said Caderousse, \"when you have access to countless stores.\" One would have said Andrea anticipated his companion\u0027s words, so did his eye flash like lightning, but it was but for a moment. \"True,\" he replied, \"and my protector is very kind.\" \n \"That dear protector,\" said Caderousse; \"and how much does he give you monthly?\" \n \"Five thousand francs.\" \n \"As many thousands as you give me hundreds! Truly, it is only bastards who are thus fortunate. Five thousand francs per month! What the devil can you do with all that?\" \n \"Oh, it is no trouble to spend that; and I am like you, I want capital.\" \n \"Capital?--yes--I understand--every one would like capital.\" \n \"Well, and I shall get it.\" \n \"Who will give it to you--your prince?\" \n \"Yes, my prince. But unfortunately I must wait.\" \n \"You must wait for what?\" asked Caderousse. \n \"For his death \" \n \"The death of your prince?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"How so?\" \n \"Because he has made his will in my favor.\" \n \"Indeed?\" \n \"On my honor.\" \n \"For how much?\" \n \"For five hundred thousand.\" \n \"Only that? It\u0027s little enough \" \n \"But so it is.\" \n \"No it cannot be!\" \n \"Are you my friend, Caderousse?\" \n \"Yes, in life or death.\" \n \"Well, I will tell you a secret.\" \n \"What is it?\" \n \"But remember\"-- \n \"Ah, mute as a carp.\" \n \"Well, I think\"--Andrea stopped and looked around. \n \"You think? Do not fear; pardieu, we are alone.\" \n \"I think I have discovered my father.\" \n \"Your true father?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"Not old Cavalcanti?\" \n \"No, for he has gone again; the true one, as you say.\" \n \"And that father is\"-- \n \"Well, Caderousse, it is Monte Cristo.\" \n \"Bah!\" \n \"Yes, you understand, that explains all. He cannot acknowledge me openly, it appears, but he does it through M. Cavalcanti, and gives him fifty thousand francs for it.\" \n \"Fifty thousand francs for being your father? I would have done it for half that, for twenty thousand, for fifteen thousand; why did you not think of me, ungrateful man?\" \n \"Did I know anything about it, when it was all done when I was down there?\" \n \"Ah, truly? And you say that by his will\"-- \n \"He leaves me five hundred thousand livres.\" \n \"Are you sure of it?\" \n \"He showed it me; but that is not all--there is a codicil, as I said just now.\" \n \"Probably.\" \n \"And in that codicil he acknowledges me.\" \n \"Oh, the good father, the brave father, the very honest father!\" said Caderousse, twirling a plate in the air between his two hands. \n \"Now say if I conceal anything from you?\" \n \"No, and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion; and your princely father, is he rich, very rich?\" \n \"Yes, he is that; he does not himself know the amount of his fortune.\" \n \"Is it possible?\" \n \"It is evident enough to me, who am always at his house. The other day a banker\u0027s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate; yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold.\" Caderousse was filled with wonder; the young man\u0027s words sounded to him like metal, and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis. \"And you go into that house?\" cried he briskly. \n \"When I like.\" \n Caderousse was thoughtful for a moment. It was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind. Then suddenly,--\"How I should like to see all that,\" cried he; \"how beautiful it must be!\" \n \"It is, in fact, magnificent,\" said Andrea. \n \"And does he not live in the Champs-Elysées?\" \n \"Yes, No. 30.\" \n \"Ah,\" said Caderousse, \"No. 30.\" \n \"Yes, a fine house standing alone, between a court-yard and a garden,--you must know it.\" \n \"Possibly; but it is not the exterior I care for, it is the interior. What beautiful furniture there must be in it!\" \n \"Have you ever seen the Tuileries?\" \n \"No.\" \n \"Well, it surpasses that.\" \n \"It must be worth one\u0027s while to stoop, Andrea, when that good M. Monte Cristo lets fall his purse.\" \n \"It is not worth while to wait for that,\" said Andrea; \"money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard.\" \n \"But you should take me there one day with you.\" \n \"How can I? On what plea?\" \n \"You are right; but you have made my mouth water. I must absolutely see it; I shall find a way.\" \n \"No nonsense, Caderousse!\" \n \"I will offer myself as floor-polisher.\" \n \"The rooms are all carpeted.\" \n \"Well, then, I must be contented to imagine it.\" \n \"That is the best plan, believe me.\" \n \"Try, at least, to give me an idea of what it is.\" \n \"How can I?\" \n \"Nothing is easier. Is it large?\" \n \"Middling.\" \n \"How is it arranged?\" \n \"Faith, I should require pen, ink, and paper to make a plan.\" \n \"They are all here,\" said Caderousse, briskly. He fetched from an old secretary a sheet of white paper and pen and ink. \"Here,\" said Caderousse, \"draw me all that on the paper, my boy.\" Andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began. \"The house, as I said, is between the court and the garden; in this way, do you see?\" Andrea drew the garden, the court and the house. \n \"High walls?\" \n \"Not more than eight or ten feet.\" \n \"That is not prudent,\" said Caderousse. \n \"In the court are orange-trees in pots, turf, and clumps of flowers.\" \n \"And no steel-traps?\" \n \"No.\" \n \"The stables?\" \n \"Are on either side of the gate, which you see there.\" And Andrea continued his plan. \n \"Let us see the ground floor,\" said Caderousse. \n \"On the ground-floor, dining-room, two drawing-rooms, billiard-room, staircase in the hall, and a little back staircase.\" \n \"Windows?\" \n \"Magnificent windows, so beautiful, so large, that I believe a man of your size should pass through each frame.\" \n \"Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows?\" \n \"Luxury has everything.\" \n \"But shutters?\" \n \"Yes, but they are never used. That Count of Monte Cristo is an original, who loves to look at the sky even at night.\" \n \"And where do the servants sleep?\" \n \"Oh, they have a house to themselves. Picture to yourself a pretty coach-house at the right-hand side where the ladders are kept. Well, over that coach-house are the servants\u0027 rooms, with bells corresponding with the different apartments.\" \n \"Ah, diable--bells did you say?\" \n \"What do you mean?\" \n \"Oh. nothing! I only say they cost a load of money to hang, and what is the use of them, I should like to know?\" \n \"There used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night, but it has been taken to the house at Auteuil, to that you went to, you know.\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"I was saying to him only yesterday, \u0027You are imprudent, Monsieur Count; for when you go to Auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected.\u0027 Well,\u0027 said he, \u0027what next?\u0027 \u0027Well, next, some day you will be robbed.\u0027\" \n \"What did he answer?\" \n \"He quietly said, \u0027What do I care if I am?\u0027\" \n \"Andrea, he has some secretary with a spring.\" \n \"How do you know?\" \n \"Yes, which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune. I was told there were such at the last exhibition.\" \n \"He has simply a mahogany secretary, in which the key is always kept.\" \n \"And he is not robbed?\" \n \"No; his servants are all devoted to him.\" \n \"There ought to be some money in that secretary?\" \n \"There may be. No one knows what there is.\" \n \"And where is it?\" \n \"On the first floor.\" \n \"Sketch me the plan of that floor, as you have done of the ground floor, my boy.\" \n \"That is very simple.\" Andrea took the pen. \"On the first story, do you see, there is the anteroom and the drawing-room; to the right of the drawing-room, a library and a study; to the left, a bedroom and a dressing-room. The famous secretary is in the dressing-room.\" \n \"Is there a window in the dressing-room?\" \n \"Two,--one here and one there.\" Andrea sketched two windows in the room, which formed an angle on the plan, and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom. Caderousse became thoughtful. \"Does he often go to Auteuil?\" added he. \n \"Two or three times a week. To-morrow, for instance, he is going to spend the day and night there.\" \n \"Are you sure of it?\" \n \"He has invited me to dine there.\" \n \"There\u0027s a life for you,\" said Caderousse; \"a town house and a country house.\" \n \"That is what it is to be rich.\" \n \"And shall you dine there?\" \n \"Probably.\" \n \"When you dine there, do you sleep there?\" \n \"If I like; I am at home there.\" Caderousse looked at the young man, as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart. But Andrea drew a cigar-case from his pocket, took a havana, quietly lit it, and began smoking. \"When do you want your twelve hundred francs?\" said he to Caderousse. \n \"Now, if you have them.\" Andrea took five and twenty louis from his pocket. \n \"Yellow boys?\" said Caderousse; \"no, I thank you.\" \n \"Oh, you despise them.\" \n \"On the contrary, I esteem them, but will not have them.\" \n \"You can change them, idiot; gold is worth five sous.\" \n \"Exactly; and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse, lay hands on him, and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold. No nonsense, my good fellow; silver simply, round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them. Anybody may possess a five-franc piece.\" \n \"But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me? I should want a porter.\" \n \"Well, leave them with your porter; he is to be trusted. I will call for them.\" \n \"To-day?\" \n \"No, to-morrow; I shall not have time to day.\" \n \"Well, to-morrow I will leave them when I go to Auteuil.\" \n \"May I depend on it?\" \n \"Certainly.\" \n \"Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it.\" \n \"Now see here, will that be all? Eh? And will you not torment me any more?\" \n \"Never.\" Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change. He redoubled his gayety and carelessness. \"How sprightly you are,\" said Caderousse; \"One would say you were already in possession of your property.\" \n \"No, unfortunately; but when I do obtain it\"-- \n \"Well?\" \n \"I shall remember old friends, I can tell you that.\" \n \"Yes, since you have such a good memory.\" \n \"What do you want? It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?\" \n \"I? What an idea! I, who am going to give you another piece of good advice.\" \n \"What is it?\" \n \"To leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger. We shall both get into trouble. You will ruin both yourself and me by your folly.\" \n \"How so?\" said Andrea. \n \"How? You put on a livery, you disguise yourself as a servant, and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs.\" \n \"You guess well.\" \n \"I know something of diamonds; I have had some.\" \n \"You do well to boast of it,\" said Andrea, who, without becoming angry, as Caderousse feared, at this new extortion, quietly resigned the ring. Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect. \n \"It is a false diamond,\" said Caderousse. \n \"You are joking now,\" replied Andrea. \n \"Do not be angry, we can try it.\" Caderousse went to the window, touched the glass with it, and found it would cut. \n \"Confiteor!\" said Caderousse, putting the diamond on his little finger; \"I was mistaken; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worth while to rob a jeweller\u0027s shop--it is another branch of industry paralyzed.\" \n \"Have you finished?\" said Andrea,--\"do you want anything more?--will you have my waistcoat or my hat? Make free, now you have begun.\" \n \"No; you are, after all, a good companion; I will not detain you, and will try to cure myself of my ambition.\" \n \"But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold.\" \n \"I shall not sell it--do not fear.\" \n \"Not at least till the day after to-morrow,\" thought the young man. \n \"Happy rogue,\" said Caderousse; \"you are going to find your servants, your horses, your carriage, and your betrothed!\" \n \"Yes,\" said Andrea. \n \"Well, I hope you will make a handsome wedding-present the day you marry Mademoiselle Danglars.\" \n \"I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head.\" \n \"What fortune has she?\" \n \"But I tell you\"-- \n \"A million?\" Andrea shrugged his shoulders. \n \"Let it be a million,\" said Caderousse; \"you can never have so much as I wish you.\" \n \"Thank you,\" said the young man. \n \"Oh, I wish it you with all my heart!\" added Caderousse with his hoarse laugh. \"Stop, let me show you the way.\" \n \"It is not worth while.\" \n \"Yes, it is.\" \n \"Why?\" \n \"Because there is a little secret, a precaution I thought it desirable to take, one of Huret \u0026 Fitchet\u0027s locks, revised and improved by Gaspard Caderousse; I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist.\" \n \"Thank you,\" said Andrea; \"I will let you know a week beforehand.\" They parted. Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen Andrea go down the three stories, but also cross the court. Then he returned hastily, shut his door carefully, and began to study, like a clever architect, the plan Andrea had left him. \n 就在马尔塞夫伯爵受了腾格拉尔的冷遇、含羞带怒地离开银行家的府邸的那天晚上，安德烈·卡瓦尔康蒂先生带着鬈曲的头发、式样美观的胡须以及松紧合宜的白手套，走进了安顿大马路腾格拉尔爵府的前庭。他在客厅里坐了还不到十分钟，就把腾格拉尔拉到一边，拖他到了一个凸出的窗口前面。他先说了一篇机巧的序言，说自从他那高贵的父亲离开以后，他是多么的想念和挂虑他；然后他就向那位银行家道谢，说他一家人待他真是太好了，简直把他当作自己的侄子一样看待；然后，他承认地的热情已找到了一个归宿，而那个归宿点便是腾格拉尔小姐。腾格拉尔极其注意地倾听着，最近这几天来，他一直期待着这一番表白，现在终于听到了，他的眼睛里闪出兴奋的光芒，和听马尔塞夫讲话时那种低头沉思的神气成了鲜明的对比。但他还不愿意立刻就答应那个青年的要求，表面上略微犹像了一下。“您现在考虑结婚不是太年轻一点儿了吗，安德烈先生。” \n “不，的确不，阁下，”卡瓦尔康蒂先生答道，“在意大利，贵族一般都很早就结婚。这是一种很合理的风俗。人生是这样易于变幻，当快乐来到我们前面的时候，我们应该及时地抓住它。” \n “嗯，阁下，”腾格拉尔说，“您的建议使我很感光荣，假如我太太和女儿也同意的话，那些初步的手续由谁来办理呢？我想，这样重要的一次商谈，应该由双方的父亲出面才好。” \n “阁下，家父是一个极有先见之明和非常审慎的人。他正想到我或许愿意在法国成家立业，所以在他离开的时候，把那些证明我身分的文件都留交给了我，并且还留下一封信，说假如我的选择符合他的心愿，就答应从我结婚的那天起，可以让我每年有十五万里弗的收入。这笔款子，我估计，约占家父每年收入的四分之一。” \n “我，”腾格拉尔说，“我早已准备给我的女儿五十万法郎作嫁妆，而且，她还是我的独生女儿。” \n “嗯，”安德烈说，“您看，这样就已经很好了。假如腾格拉尔男爵夫人和欧热妮小姐不拒绝我的求婚的话。我们每年就可以有十七万五千里弗任意支配。要是我能劝动侯爵把我的本金给我，这当然不见得能实现，但还是可能的，我们就把这两三百万交给您，而这两三百万一旦到了一个老手的手里，至少可以赚到一个一分利。” \n “我给别人的利息从不超过四厘，普通的只有三厘半，但对我的女婿，我可以给五厘，我们大家可以分享赢利。” \n “好极了，岳父大人，”卡瓦尔康蒂说，这句话暴露了他那下贱的本性，他虽极力想巧用贵族的派头掩饰那种本性，但有时却仍不免要流露出来。他立刻校正自己说道，“原谅我，阁下。您看，单是希望就已使我快要发疯了，假如希望真的实现了，我还不知要成什么样了呢！” \n “但是，”腾格拉尔说，他并没发觉这番最初毫不涉及金钱的谈话，变成了一场商业谈判，“在你的财产当中，有一部分令尊无疑是不能拒绝您的罗？” \n “哪一笔？”青年问。 \n “就是您从令堂那儿继承来的那一笔。” \n “是的，的确。我从家母奥丽伐·高塞奈黎那儿继承了一笔财产。 \n “那笔财产有多少？” \n “说老实话，阁下，”安德烈说，“我向您保证，我从没去想过，但据我猜测，那笔财产至少肯定有两百万。” \n 腾格拉尔喜不自胜，犹如守财奴找到了一笔失踪的财宝，或沉船的海员在精疲力尽的时候忽然感觉脚踏到实地了一样。 \n “嗯，阁下，”安德烈说，毕恭毕敬地向银行家鞠了一躬，“我可以希望吗？” \n “安德烈先生，”腾格拉尔说，“您不但可以希望，而且或许可以认为这件事情已是确定无疑的了，假如您这方面没什么阻碍的话。只是，”他若有所思地又加上了一句话，“您的保护人基督山先生这次怎么不来代您提亲呢？” \n 安德烈略微涨红了脸。“我刚从伯爵那儿来，阁下，”他说，“他无疑是个很风趣的人，但他有些念头却古怪得难以想象。他对我估计得很高，他甚至告诉我说，他绝对相信家父不会仅仅让我收用利息，而会把那笔本金也给我的。他答应为我设法办到这一点。但他又说，他从不代人提亲，将来也决不做这种事。但是，我必须为他说句公道话，他说道，假如他生平对自己的这种态度曾表示过遗憾的话，那么就是这一次了，因为他认为这桩婚姻将来一定会很美满的。而且，他还告诉我，尽管他不公开出面，但假如您有什么问题去问他，他一定会答复您的。” \n “啊！好极了！” \n “现在，”安德烈带着他那种最可爱的微笑说道，“我跟岳父谈过了，我必须还得跟银行家来谈一谈。” \n “您有什么事要跟他谈？”腾格拉尔也微笑着说道。 \n “就是后天我就可以从您这儿提取四千法郎了。伯爵怕我的经常收入不够下个月的开支，给了我一张两万法郎的支票。您看，这上面有他的签字，您可以接受吗？” \n “这样的支票，”腾格拉尔说，“就是一百万票面的我也很乐于接受，”他把那张支票塞进了口袋里。“您定个时间吧，明天什么时候要，我的出纳将带着一张两万四千法郎的支票来拜访您。” \n “那么，十点钟吧，假如您方便的话。我希望能早一点，因为明天我要到乡下去。” \n “很好，十点钟。您还住在太子旅馆吗？” \n “是的。” \n 那位银行家的确很守时，第二天早晨，正当那个年轻人要出门的时候，那两万四千法郎就交到了他的手里，于是他就出门去了，留下了两百法郎给卡德鲁斯。他这次出门主要是为躲避这个危险的敌人的，所以尽可能地在外逗留到很晚才回来。但他刚从马车里跨出来，门房就手里拿着一包东西来见他了。“先生，”他说，“那个人已经来过了。” \n “什么人？”安德烈态度很随便地说，表面上似乎已经把他时刻害怕着的那个人给忘了。 \n “就是大人给了他那一小笔养老金的那个人。” \n “哦！”安德烈说，“我父亲的老乡。嗯，你把我留给他的那两百法郎交给他了吧？” \n “是的，大人。”安德烈曾表示过希望人家这样称呼他，“但是，”门房继续说道，“他不肯拿。” \n 安德烈的脸色顿时变白了；由于天黑，所以别人没注意到那一点。“什么！他不肯拿？”他用一种略带焦急的口吻问道。 \n “不，他想见见大人，我告诉他说您出门去了。他坚持说要见您，但最后似乎相信了我的话，就交了这封信给我，这封信是他随身带来的，本来已经封好口的了。” \n “给我，”安德烈说。于是他借着车灯的光拆开了那封信：“你知道我住的地方。明天早晨九点钟，我等你来。” \n 安德烈仔细地检查了一下那封信，看是否曾被人拆开过，是否被人偷看过里面的内容：但这封信的封口非常缜密，假如有人想偷看，则必须撕破封口，可封口却原封未动。“好极了，”他说，“可怜！他真是一个老好人。”他丢下门房，让他去细细地咀嚼这几句话，后者被弄得莫名其妙的，不知道这主仆二人究竟哪一个更值得钦佩。“赶快卸马，上来见我，”安德烈对他的马夫说。这个青年几步跳进了他的房间，立刻烧掉了卡德鲁斯的信。刚一完事，仆人就进来了。“你的身材和我差不多，庇利。”他说。 \n “我很荣幸，大人。” \n “你昨天做了一套新制服？” \n “是的，大人。” \n “我今晚上要跟一位漂亮的小姐约会，我不想让人知道。把你那套制服借给我用一下，你的证件也拿来，假如需要的话，我就可以在一家客栈里过夜了。”庇利遵命照办。五分钟之后，安德烈就全身化装妥当，离开了旅馆，叫了一辆双轮马车，吩咐车夫驶往洛基旅馆。第二天早晨，他象离开太子旅馆那样毫不引人注意地离开了那家小客栈，穿过圣·安多尼路，顺着林荫大道走到密尼蒙旦街，在左边第三座房子门口停了下来，当时门房正巧不在，他四下里看了一下，想找个人问一下。 \n “你找谁呀，我的好小伙子？”对面卖苹果的女人问。 \n “找派里登先生，我的胖大妈。”安德烈回答。 \n “是那个退休的面包师吗？”卖苹果的女人问。 \n “一点不错。” \n “他住在院子尽头左边的四层楼上。” \n 安德烈顺着她的指示去找。在四楼的房间门外，他找到了一只兔子脚掌，铃声立刻急促地响起来，由此显然可见他拉这只脚掌的时候脾气坏极了。一会儿之后，卡德鲁斯的脸在门上的小洞里出现了。“啊，你很守时。”他一边说，一边拔开了门闩。 \n “当然！”安德烈说，他走了进去，使劲把帽子一摔，但没摔到椅子上，那顶硬边的制服帽在地板上骨碌碌地转了一个圈。 \n “喂，喂，我的小家伙，别生气呀。瞧，我很挂念你呢。看看我们这顿丰盛的早餐吧。都是你爱吃的东西。” \n 安德烈的确嗅到了饭菜的香味，他对于这种气味倒并非不欢迎，因为他实在饿极了，他所闻到的，是下等乡下厨房里所特有的那种马肉和大蒜的混合味；此外，还有红烧鱼的香味，而最强烈的，则是那刺鼻的茴香味。这些气味是从两只炉子上的两只盖着的菜碟和一只放在铁炉上的一只锅里散发出来的。在隔壁房间里，安德烈看到有一张相当干净的桌子，上面摆着两副餐具，两瓶酒，一瓶的封口是绿色的，一瓶的封口是黄色的，一只玻璃杯里装着很多白兰地，一只瓦盆里巧妙地堆叠着几种水果，水果底下垫着一叶椰菜。 \n “你觉得如何，我的小家伙？”卡德鲁斯说。“呀，味道很好，你知道我是一个烧菜的好手。还记得你以前常常舔手指头的那回事吗？凡是我能烧的菜，你都尝过，我想你对它们大概很喜欢的吧。”卡德鲁斯一边说，一边继续剥洋葱。 \n “但是，”安德烈发火了，“哼！假如你这次打扰我的目的只是要我来和你吃一顿早餐，那真是活见鬼了！” \n “我的孩子，”卡德鲁斯咬文嚼字地说，“我们可以边吃边谈嘛。喏，又忘恩负义啦！你不高兴见见一位老朋友吗？我可是高兴得直流眼泪啦。” \n 他的确正在流眼泪，但究竟那是高兴的结果还是洋葱对邦杜加客栈老店主的泪腺起了作用，很难说。 \n “闭上你的嘴吧，伪君子！”安德烈说，“你爱我？” \n “是的，我真的爱你，说假话就天诛地灭！我知道这是我的弱点，”卡德鲁斯说，“但是我自己无法克制。” \n “可是那却并没有阻止你把我叫来，跟我玩鬼把戏。” \n “喏！”卡德鲁斯说，把他那把很长的小刀在围裙上抹了几下，“要不是我喜欢你，你以为我会忍受你赐给我的这种可怜的生活吗？你且想想看。你身上穿的是你仆人的衣服。由此可知你雇着一个仆人。而我则没有仆人，我不得不自己烧饭。你瞧不起我烧的菜，因为你可以在巴黎酒家或太子旅馆的餐厅里吃饭。嗯，我也可以雇个仆人。我也可以有一辆轻便马车，我也可以爱到哪儿吃饭就在哪儿去吃饭，但我为什么不这样呢？因为我不愿意使我的小贝尼代托不高兴。来！我这番话你总得承认是对的吧，嗯！”说这篇话的时候，他目光中的含义是决不难懂的。 \n “嗯！”安德烈说，“就算承认你是爱我的，但你为什么要我来和你吃早餐呢？” \n “就是为了能见见你呀，我的小家伙。” \n “我们一切都商量好了的嘛，又何必再见我呢？” \n “咦！好朋友，”卡德鲁斯说，“立遗嘱难道竟没有附言吗？你主要是来吃早餐的，不是吗？嗯，请坐吧，我们先来吃这些鲱鱼，还有新鲜的奶油，你看，我把它放在葡萄叶子上，就是为了要讨你喜欢，你这混蛋。啊，是的！你在观察我的房间，看我这四张蹩脚椅子，看我这三个法郎一张的画片。但你还想能看到什么好东西呢？这里可不是太子旅馆。” \n “喏！你愈来愈不知满足了，你又不快乐啦。你本来只想扮演一个退休的面包师的。” \n 卡德鲁斯叹了一口气。 \n “嗯！你还有什么话要说？你已经看到你的梦想实现啦。” \n “我只能说那仍只是一个梦想。我可怜的贝尼代托，一个退休的面包师是很有钱的，他可以拿年金。” \n “嗯，你也可以拿年金呀。” \n “我有吗？” \n “是的，因为我已经把你那两百法郎带来了。” \n 卡德鲁斯耸了耸他的肩。“象这样勉强向人讨钱用，实在太丢脸了，”他说，“一笔不稳定的收入不久或许就会断绝的。你看，我不得不省吃俭用，以防你的倒运。唉，我的朋友，命运是变化无常的，这是那个——那个军队里的教士说的话。我知道你的运气很好，你这混蛋，你就要娶腾格拉尔的女儿了。” \n “什么！腾格拉尔！” \n “是的，当然是的！难道要我一定得说腾格拉尔男爵吗？老实告诉你，贝尼代托伯爵，他是我的老朋友。假如他的记忆力不那么糟的话，他应该来请我去喝你的喜酒。因为他曾参加了我的婚礼。是的，是的，参加了我的！当然！他以前可不象现在这样骄傲，他那时只是那好心肠的莫雷尔先生手下的一个小职员。我跟他和马尔塞夫伯爵曾一起吃过好多次饭。所以你看，我也有一些体面的关系，要是我把那种关系略加发展，我们或许还能在同一个客厅里见面哪。” \n “哼，您的妒忌心现在简直使你异想天开了，卡德鲁斯。” \n “异想天开也很不错呀，我的贝尼代托，我知道自己在说什么话。或许有一天我会穿上象样的衣服，走到他们家的大门口，说：‘请开门！’但现在，我们且坐下来吃东西吧。” \n 卡德鲁斯自作榜样，胃口极好地吃起那顿早餐来，每端一样菜到他的客人面前，就称赞一番。后者似乎屈服了；他拔开了酒瓶塞子，割了一大块鱼以及大蒜和肥肉。“啊，伙伴！” \n 卡德鲁斯说，“你同你的老东家慢慢地和好起来了吧！” \n “是的，的确。”安德烈回答，他那年轻强健的胃口暂时压倒了其他的一切。 \n “那么你很喜欢这些菜了，乖儿子？” \n “很喜欢，我奇怪一个人能吃到这么好的东西，怎么还要抱怨说生活太苦。” \n “你难道看不出来吗？”卡德鲁斯说，“我虽然快乐，但脑子里却老放不下一个念头。” \n “什么念头？” \n “就是：我是靠朋友过活的——我，我一向都是自己养活自己的。” \n “你不必为这点不安，我还养得起一个人。” \n “不，真的，信不信由你，每到一个月的月底，我心里就懊丧极了。” \n “善良的卡德鲁斯！” \n “以至昨天我不肯接受那两百法郎。” \n “是的，你想跟我说说话。但告诉我，你真的很悔恨吗？” \n “真的很悔恨，而且，我忽然想起了一个念头。” \n 安德烈不禁打了个寒颤；卡德鲁斯每起一个念头，他总是要打寒颤的。 \n “这真痛苦。你看可不是吗？老是要等到每个月的月底。” \n “噢！”安德烈决定严密注意他的同伴，就以哲学家的口吻说，“人生不就是在等待中过去的吗？举个例子来说，我的情形难道比你好吗？嗯，我很耐心地等待着，可不是吗？” \n “是的，因为你所等待的不只是区区两百法郎，而是五六千，或许一万，一万二千，因为你是个狡猾的家伙。过去，你老是藏着一个小钱袋，想瞒过你这可怜的朋友卡德鲁斯。幸亏这个朋友有一个很灵敏的鼻子。” \n “你又来噜苏了，谈来谈去总是谈过去的事情！你拿那种事来打扰我有什么用呢？” \n “啊！你才二十一岁，可以忘记过去。可我我已经是五十岁的人了，我不得不想念那些往事。但我们且回到正经事上来吧。” \n “好的。” \n “我想说，假如我处于你的位置——” \n “怎么样？” \n “我就得设法实现——” \n “你想实现什么？” \n “我会以买农场为借口，要求预支六个月的钱，有了六个月的收入，我就可以溜之大吉了。” \n “嗯，嗯，”安德烈说，“那个念头倒不坏。” \n “我的好朋友，”卡德鲁斯说，“吃了我的面包，就接受了我的忠告吧。不论从肉体或精神上讲，你都决不会吃亏的。” \n “但是，”安德烈说，“你为什么不按你给我的忠告去做呢？你为什么不预支六个月或甚至一年的收入，然后隐退到布鲁塞尔去呢？你不必装退休的面包师，你可以装成一个破产者，那也很不错呀。” \n “只有一千二百法郎，你叫我怎么退休呢？” \n “啊，卡德鲁斯，”安德烈说，“你多贪心呀！一个月以前，你还在饥饿中挣扎。” \n “胃口是愈吃愈大的呀，”卡德鲁斯说，他狞笑了一下，象猴子大笑或老虎咆哮时那样露出了他的牙齿。“而且，”他用那些又大又白的牙齿咬下了一大块面包，又说道，“我想出了一个计划。”安德烈对卡德鲁斯的计划比好的念头更害怕，念头只是胚胎，计划却是现实了。 \n “让我来看看你的计划吧，我敢说那一定很不错。” \n “为什么不呢？我们离开那个——那个地方的计划是谁想出来的，嗯？不是我吗？我相信那个计划就很不错。因为我们现在已经到了这儿了。” \n “我并没有说你从来不曾想出过一个好计划，”安德烈回答，“但且让我们来看看你现在的这个计划吧。” \n “嗯，”卡德鲁斯说，“你能不花一个子儿就使我得到一万五千法郎吗？不，一万五千还不够，要是少了三万法郎，我就无法再做一个规规矩矩的人。” \n “不，”安德烈不感兴趣地答道，“不，我不能。” \n “我想你大概还没弄懂我的意思，”卡德鲁斯平心静气地回答说，“我是说你自己不必掏一个子儿。” \n “你要我去偷去抢，把我的好运——我们两个人的好运——就此断送掉，让我们两个人再被拖进那个地方去吗？” \n “我倒一点儿不在乎，”卡德鲁斯说，“即使再被捉去也无所谓，我是一个孤零零的可怜虫，有时候很怀念我那些老同伴。我可不象你，你是一个没心没肺的人，只指望永远不再见到他们。” \n 安德烈这次不仅打了一个寒颤，而且脸色都变苍白了。 \n “得了，卡德鲁斯，别说废话了！”他说。 \n “你不要急，我的小贝尼代托，我并不要你帮我去弄那五万法郎，而只要你给我说明一些情形，我自能设法。” \n “那么，我来看看吧！我来给你考虑考虑！”安德烈说。 \n “目前，你可以把我的月薪提高到五百法郎吧，我的小家伙？我有个想法，很想雇一个管家。” \n “好吧，就给你五百法郎，”安德烈说，“但在我这方面，这已经是非常为难的了，我可怜的卡德鲁斯。你利用——” \n “嘿！”卡德鲁斯说，“你的身边就有取之不尽、用之不竭的宝库哪。” \n 或许有人会说安德烈正期待他的同伴说这句话，因为他的眼睛顿时亮了起来，但那种光立刻就消失了。 \n “不错，”他答道，“我的保护人待我非常亲切。” \n “可爱的保护人！”卡德鲁斯说。“他每月给你多少钱？” \n “五千法郎。” \n “你给我五百，他给你五千！真是的，只有私生子才能交到这样的好运。五千法郎一个月！那么多钱你可怎么用呢？” \n “噢，那很快就会花光的，所以我象你一样，也需要一笔本金。” \n “一笔本金！是的，我懂，人人都望有一笔本金呀。” \n “嗯！我可以弄到一笔。” \n “谁给你呢？是你那位王爷吗？” \n “是的，我那位王爷。” \n “但你必须等一下罗？”卡德鲁斯问。 \n “等到他死的时候。” \n “等到你那位王爷死的时候？” \n “是的。” \n “为什么呢？” \n “因为他在遗嘱里写明遗赠给我一笔钱。” \n “真的？” \n “以人格担保。” \n “给你多少？” \n “五十万。” \n “就这么个数目！够少的啦！” \n “但事实如此。” \n “不，不可能的！” \n “你是我的朋友吗，卡德鲁斯？” \n “当然是的，是生死之交。” \n “那么，我来告诉你一个秘密。” \n “什么秘密？” \n “要记住——” \n “啊，当然罗！绝不泄漏。” \n “嗯！我想——” \n 安德烈住了嘴，四下里望了一下。 \n “你在想什么？别怕，真的！只有我们两个人。” \n “我想我已经发现了我的父亲。” \n “你的真父亲？” \n “是的。” \n “不是老卡瓦尔康蒂？” \n “不，因为他已经走了，而是你所说的真的。” \n “而那个父亲就是——” \n “嗯，卡德鲁斯，就是基督山。” \n “什么！” \n “是的，你也明白，一切都很明白。看来他不能公开承认我。所以他通过卡瓦尔康蒂先生来达到那个目的，他为这件事给了他五万法郎。” \n “五万法郎做你的父亲！只要一半我就干了，有两万，有一万五千，我也肯干的。你为什么不想见我呢，你这个忘恩负义的家伙？” \n “这件事我事先怎么知道？我们还在那个地方的时候就一切都安排好了。” \n “啊，这倒也是！而你说，在他的遗嘱里——” \n “留给了我五十万里弗。” \n “你能确定吗？” \n “他给我看过的。事情还不仅止于此，遗嘱里还有一笔附言。” \n “可能的。” \n “在那笔附录里，他承认了我。” \n “噢，善良的父亲！勇敢的父亲！万分忠实的父亲呀！”卡德鲁斯一边说，一边把一只菜碟抛到空中，又用双手将它接住。 \n “现在你自己说吧，我有没有瞒你什么事？” \n “没有，依我来看，你对我的信任也为你增光不少，你那位富甲王侯的父亲是很有钱、非常有钱的罗？” \n “是的，那倒是事实，他自己也不知道他的财产究竟有多少。” \n “竟有这种事？” \n “我看那是够明显的了。我常常呆在他的家里。有一天，银行里的一个职员用一只和你的菜碟差不多大小的文书夹给他带来了五万法郎。昨天，我银行里的人又给他带来了十六法郎的金洋。” \n 卡德鲁斯吃惊极了。在他听来，这个青年人的话简直象金属那样响亮；他好象已听到了金路易玎玲当啷的声音。“你能走进那座房子？”他直率地喊道。 \n “只要我高兴，随时都能进去。” \n 卡德鲁斯想了一会儿。他脑了里正在转一个重要的念头，这是很容易看得出来的。然后他突然大声说道：“我多想去看看呀！那一定很美吧！” \n “是的，的确，美极了。”安德烈说。 \n “他不是住在香榭丽舍大道吗？” \n “是的，门牌三十号。” \n “啊！“卡德鲁斯说，“三十号。” \n “是的，一座很漂亮的孤立的房子，正面有前庭，后面有花园，你一定认得的。” \n “可能的，但我所关心的并不是它的外表，而是它的内部。里面的家具一定美丽极了！” \n “你见过土伊勒里宫没有？” \n “没有。” \n “嗯，它胜过了那座王宫。” \n “安德烈，不知那位好心肠的基督山先生要什么时候才能扔下一个钱袋来？” \n “噢！不必等他扔下一个钱袋来，”安德烈说，“那座房子里的钱就象果园里的果子一样多。” \n “你应该找个时候带我到那儿去一次。” \n “我怎么能这样呢？以什么借口呢？” \n “你说得不错，但你已经使我流口水。当然罗，我一定要去看看，我可以想出一个办法的。” \n “别说废话了，卡德鲁斯！” \n “我可以装成一个擦地板工人，找上门去。” \n “所有的房间都是铺地毯的。” \n “嗯，那么，我只能在想象中看看那一切来聊以自慰了。” \n “那再好不过了，相信我吧。” \n “它究竟是个什么样？至少也得给我一个印象呀。” \n “我怎么形容呢？” \n “那是再容易不过的事了。那房子大不大？” \n “中等。” \n “位置如何？” \n “真的，我得要支笔、墨水和纸来画幅图了。” \n “这儿都有，”卡德鲁斯连忙说。他从一只旧写字台里拿出了一张白纸、笔和墨水。“喏，”他说，“都给我画在这张纸上吧，我的孩子。” \n 安德烈带着一个难以觉察的微笑拿起笔，开始画起来。 \n “那座房子，我已经说过，前后都有庭园，是这个样子的，你懂了吗？”安德烈把花园、房屋和前庭都画了出来。 \n “墙头很高吗？” \n “最多不过八到十呎。” \n “真谨慎呀。”卡德鲁斯说。 \n “前庭里有子树盆景、草地和花丛。” \n “没有铁丝网吗？” \n “没有。” \n “马厩呢？” \n “在大门的两侧，就在这个地方。”安德烈继续画他的草图。 \n “我们来看看楼下的情形吧。”卡德鲁斯说。 \n “楼下那一层是餐厅、两间客厅、弹子房，大厅里有一座楼梯，后面有一座小楼梯。” \n “窗子呢？” \n “窗户也华丽得很，很漂亮，很大，我相信象你这样身材的人，从每个窗眼里钻进去是不成问题的。” \n “有了这么大的窗户，他们干吗还要装楼梯呢？” \n “阔人家里是什么都有的。” \n “百叶窗呢？” \n “有的，但却从来不用。基督山伯爵是一个很特别的人，他甚至爱在夜里看天空。” \n “仆人们住在什么地方呢？” \n “噢，他们自己有一座房子。右边这儿有一间小小的车房，里面有梯子。嗯！那间车房楼上就是仆人的房间，里面有拉铃，可以和正屋里的房间通消息。” \n “啊，见鬼！你说有拉铃？” \n “你这话是什么意思？” \n “噢，没什么。我只是说，装那些拉铃要花很大一笔钱，而它们的用途我倒也很想知道。” \n “以前晚上有一只狗在园子里巡逻，但它已被带到欧特伊别墅去了。就是你去过的那个地方，你知道的。” \n “是的。” \n “我昨天还对他说：‘你太大意了，伯爵阁下，因为当您带着您的仆人到欧特伊去的时候，这座房子就空着的。’‘嗯，’他说，‘那又怎么样？’‘那样，您总有一天就会被人偷去东西的。’” \n “他怎么回答？” \n “他说：‘即使有人来偷我，我又何必在意呢？’” \n “安德烈，他的写字台是有机关的。” \n “你这话是什么意思？” \n “是的，那机关能捉贼和发警报。我听人说，上次的博览会上就有那东西。” \n “他只有一个桃花心木的写字台，钥匙老是插在抽屉上。” \n “他没有失窃过吗？” \n “没有，他的仆人都对他很忠心。” \n “那写字台里应该有点钱的吧？” \n “或许有。谁都不知道那里面是些什么东西。” \n “那写字台在什么地方？” \n “在二楼。” \n “把二楼也给我画个图看看，就象你画楼下的那张一样，我的孩子。” \n “那非常简单。”安德烈拿起笔来。“二楼上，你看，这是候见室和客厅，客厅的右面，一间藏书室和一间书房，左面，一间卧室和一间更衣室。那只值得注意的写字台就在更衣室里。” \n “更衣室里有窗子吗？” \n
