{"id":43923,"no":55,"title":"Chapter 59 The Will","content":"AS SOON AS Barrois had left the room, Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious expression that said many things. The young girl perfectly understood the look, and so did Villefort, for his countenance became clouded, and he knitted his eyebrows angrily. He took a seat, and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary. Noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference, at the same time giving a side look at Valentine, which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room. Three-quarters of an hour after, Barrois returned, bringing the notary with him. \"Sir,\" said Villefort, after the first salutations were over, \"you were sent for by M. Noirtier, whom you see here. All his limbs have become completely paralysed, he has lost his voice also, and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning.\" Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine, which look was at once so earnest and imperative, that she answered immediately. \"Sir,\" said she, \"I perfectly understand my grandfather\u0027s meaning at all times.\" \n \"That is quite true,\" said Barrois; \"and that is what I told the gentleman as we walked along.\" \n \"Permit me,\" said the notary, turning first to Villefort and then to Valentine--\"permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility. The first thing necessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act. Now I cannot be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me, on account of his want of speech, my services here would be quite useless, and cannot be legally exercised.\" The notary then prepared to retire. An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur. Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full of grief, that she arrested the departure of the notary. \"Sir,\" said she, \"the language which I speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt, and I can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it almost as well as I can myself. Will you tell me what you require, in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject?\" \n \"In order to render an act valid, I must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client. Illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite.\" \n \"Well, sir, by the help of two signs, with which I will acquaint you presently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties. M. Noirtier, being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify \u0027yes,\u0027 and to wink when he means \u0027no.\u0027 You now know quite enough to enable you to converse with M. Noirtier;--try.\" Noirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself. \"You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying, sir, have you?\" asked the notary. Noirtier closed his eyes. \"And you approve of what she said--that is to say, you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"It was you who sent for me?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"To make your will?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions?\" The old man winked violently. \"Well, sir,\" said the young girl, \"do you understand now, and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject?\" But before the notary could answer, Villefort had drawn him aside. \"Sir,\" said he, \"do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock, such as M. Noirtier has received, without any detriment to his mental faculties?\" \n \"It is not exactly that, sir,\" said the notary, \"which makes me uneasy, but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so as to be able to get his answers.\" \n \"You must see that to be an utter impossibility,\" said Villefort. Valentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look. \n \"Sir,\" said she, \"that need not make you uneasy, however difficult it may at first sight appear to be. I can discover and explain to you my grandfather\u0027s thoughts, so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject. I have now been six years with M. Noirtier, and let him tell you if ever once, during that time, he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand.\" \n \"No,\" signed the old man. \n \"Let us try what we can do, then,\" said the notary. \"You accept this young lady as your interpreter, M. Noirtier?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"Well, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up?\" Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to W. At this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop. \"It is very evident that it is the letter W which M. Noirtier wants,\" said the notary. \"Wait,\" said Valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she repeated, \"Wa--We--Wi\"--The old man stopped her at the last syllable. Valentine then took the dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages. She passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when she came to the word \"Will,\" M. Noirtier\u0027s eye bade her stop. \"Will,\" said the notary; \"it is very evident that M. Noirtier is desirous of making his will.\" \n \"Yes, yes, yes,\" motioned the invalid. \n \"Really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,\" said the astonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort. \"Yes,\" said the procureur, \"and I think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary, for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of Valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.\" \n \"No, no, no,\" replied the eye of the paralytic. \n \"What?\" said Villefort, \"do you mean to say that Valentine is not interested in your will?\" \n \"No.\" \n \"Sir,\" said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene, \"what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may be a perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses. As to the time, it will not require very much more than the generality of wills. There are certain forms necessary to be gone through, and which are always the same. As to the details, the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having had the management of them, can doubtless give full information on the subject. But besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be contested, I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity, therefore, one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom, will assist in the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?\" continued the notary, addressing the old man. \n \"Yes,\" looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning. \n \"What is he going to do?\" thought Villefort, whose position demanded much reserve, but who was longing to know what his father\u0027s intentions were. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent, but Barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his master\u0027s wishes, and had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his wife to come up. In the course of a quarter of an hour every one had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also arrived. A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law. They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will, in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched; then, in order to test the capacity of the testator, the first notary said, turning towards him,--\"When an individual makes his will, it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person.\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation; you will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions?\" \n \"Yes.\" There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation. Never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now, and if it was not a sublime, it was, at least, a curious spectacle. They had formed a circle round the invalid; the second notary was sitting at a table, prepared for writing, and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded. \"Your fortune exceeds 300,000 francs, does it not?\" asked he. Noirtier made a sign that it did. \"Do you possess 400,000 francs?\" inquired the notary. Noirtier\u0027s eye remained immovable. \"Five hundred thousand?\" The same expression continued. \"Six hundred thousand--700,000--800,000--900,000?\" Noirtier stopped him at the last-named sum. \"You are then in possession of 900,000 francs?\" asked the notary. \"Yes.\" \n \"In landed property?\" \n \"No.\" \n \"In stock?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"The stock is in your own hands?\" The look which M. Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find. The old servant left the room, and presently returned, bringing with him a small casket. \"Do you permit us to open this casket?\" asked the notary. Noirtier gave his assent. They opened it, and found 900,000 francs in bank scrip. The first notary handed over each note, as he examined it, to his colleague. \n The total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated. \"It is all as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor.\" Then, turning towards the paralytic, he said, \"You possess, then, 900,000 francs of capital, which, according to the manner in which you have invested it, ought to bring in an income of about 40,000 livres?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?\" \n \"Oh,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"there is not much doubt on that subject. M. Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter, Mademoiselle de Villefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years, and has, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, I had almost said the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion.\" The eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by Madame de Villefort\u0027s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain. \"Is it, then, to Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort that you leave these 900,000 francs?\" demanded the notary, thinking he had only to insert this clause, but waiting first for the assent of Noirtier, which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene. Valentine, when her name was made the subject of discussion, had stepped back, to escape unpleasant observation; her eyes were cast down, and she was crying. The old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness, then, turning towards the notary, he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent. \n \"What,\" said the notary, \"do you not intend making Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee?\" \n \"No.\" \n \"You are not making any mistake, are you?\" said the notary; \"you really mean to declare that such is not your intention?\" \n \"No,\" repeated Noirtier; \"No.\" Valentine raised her head, struck dumb with astonishment. It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief, but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act. But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed, \"Oh, grandpapa, I see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me; you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed.\" \n \"Ah, yes, most assuredly,\" said the eyes of the paralytic, for he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake. \"Thank you, thank you,\" murmured she. The old man\u0027s declaration that Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort; she gradually approached the invalid, and said: \"Then, doubtless, dear M. Noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson, Edward de Villefort?\" The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible, and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred. \n \"No?\" said the notary; \"then, perhaps, it is to your son, M. de Villefort?\" \n \"No.\" The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator. Villefort and his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other from anger. \n \"What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?\" said Valentine; \"you no longer seem to love any of us?\" The old man\u0027s eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife, and rested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fondness. \"Well,\" said she; \"if you love me, grandpapa, try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment. You know me well enough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune; besides, they say I am already rich in right of my mother--too rich, even. Explain yourself, then.\" Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentine\u0027s hand. \"My hand?\" said she. \n \"Yes.\" \n \"Her hand!\" exclaimed every one. \n \"Oh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my father\u0027s mind is really impaired,\" said Villefort. \n \"Ah,\" cried Valentine suddenly, \"I understand. It is my marriage you mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?\" \n \"Yes, yes, yes,\" signed the paralytic, casting on Valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning. \n \"You are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?\" \n \"Yes?\" \n \"Really, this is too absurd,\" said Villefort. \n \"Excuse me, sir,\" replied the notary; \"on the contrary, the meaning of M. Noirtier is quite evident to me, and I can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind.\" \n \"You do not wish me to marry M. Franz d\u0027Epinay?\" observed Valentine. \n \"I do not wish it,\" said the eye of her grandfather. \"And you disinherit your granddaughter,\" continued the notary, \"because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"So that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?\" \n \"Yes.\" There was a profound silence. The two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair. Valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude, and Villefort was biting his lips with vexation, while Madame de Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy, which, in spite of herself, appeared in her whole countenance. \"But,\" said Villefort, who was the first to break the silence, \"I consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question. I am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter\u0027s hand. It is my wish that she should marry M. Franz d\u0027Epinay--and she shall marry him.\" Valentine sank weeping into a chair. \n \"Sir,\" said the notary, \"how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying M. Franz?\" The old man gave no answer. \"You will, of course, dispose of it in some way or other?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"In favor of some member of your family?\" \n \"No.\" \n \"Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?\" pursued the notary. \n \"Yes.\" \n \"But,\" said the notary, \"you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?\" Noirtier made no answer. \"Do you still wish to dispose of all?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"But they will contest the will after your death?\" \n \"No.\" \n \"My father knows me,\" replied Villefort; \"he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands that in my position I cannot plead against the poor.\" The eye of Noirtier beamed with triumph. \"What do you decide on, sir?\" asked the notary of Villefort. \n 巴罗斯一走出房间，诺瓦蒂埃便意味深长地望着瓦朗蒂娜。那姑娘完全懂得这种目光的含意，维尔福也是懂得的，见他的脸阴沉沉的，两道眉因恼怒而紧皱到了一起。他在一张椅子上坐下来，静候那公证人到来。诺瓦蒂埃看到他坐下，表面上虽显得毫不在意，但却向瓦朗蒂娜瞟了一眼，她明白这是在说要她留在房间里不要走。半个多钟头后，巴罗斯带着那公证人回来了。 \n “阁下，”维尔福在寒暄过以后说道，“是诺瓦蒂埃先生请您来的，就是这位。他已全身瘫痪，不能讲话，我们常常要费很大的劲才能略懂一点他的意思。”诺瓦蒂埃向瓦朗蒂娜投去了一个恳求的目光，这目光中充满了焦急和迫切，她赶紧回答说：“阁下，我随时都能完全懂得我祖父的意思。” \n “这倒是真的，”巴罗斯说道，“我们一路走来的时候，我已经对这位先生这样说过了。” \n “请允许我，”公证人说道，“他先转向维尔福，然后又转向瓦朗蒂娜，“请允许我说一句话，我是位公职人员，目前这件案子，假如轻率处理的话，必然会发生危险的责任问题。公证要想有效的一个必备条件，就是公证人须完全确信他已忠实地按照委托人的意愿行事。现在，对一位不能讲话的委托人，我无法确定他准确意思，由于他失去语言能力，不能清楚地向我表明他的好恶，所以我在这儿所做了一切都不能算是合法的，即使做了也是无效的。” \n 说完那位公证人便准备告辞了。检察官的嘴角上浮过一个令人难以觉察的胜利的微笑，诺瓦蒂埃则是一副悲哀的表情望着瓦朗蒂娜，所以她急忙拦住了那位公证人，不让他离开。“阁下，”她说道，“我和我祖父进行交流的语言是很容易学会的。我可以在几分钟之内教会您的，而且可以使您几乎象我一样明白他的确切意思。您能否告诉我，您在这方面的要求是什么？” \n “为了使公证有效，我必须能明白无误地确定我的委托人对某些事是表示同意还是表示反对。身体上的病症并不影响契约的有效性，但头脑则必须绝对清醒才行。” \n “哦，阁下，仅从两个表示上您就可以完全确定我祖父的脑力依旧是十分健全的。诺瓦蒂埃先生由于不能讲话和行走，所以老是用闭眼睛来表示‘是’，用眨眼睛表示’不。您现在就可以跟诺瓦蒂埃谈话了。请试试吧。” \n 诺瓦蒂埃向瓦朗蒂娜投去了一个非常亲切和感激的目光，甚至连公证人都明白了。“您已经听到并且懂得您孙女刚才所说的话了吧？阁下？”公证人问道。诺瓦蒂埃闭了一下眼睛。“那您同意她所说的话——就是说，您一向的是象她刚才所说的那样来表达您的想法的，是吗？” \n “是的。” \n “是您要找我来的吗？” \n “是的。” \n “来给您立遗嘱吗？” \n “是的。” \n “您愿不愿意我在还没了却您原先的心愿以前就离开？” \n 老人拼命地眨着眼睛。 \n “阁下，”那姑娘说道，“您现在懂了吧，您可以完全放心了吧？” \n 公证人还没等回答，维尔福就把他拉到了一边。 \n “阁下，”他说道，“您想想看，象诺瓦蒂埃先生身体状况变成这个样子的人，他的脑力能丝毫不受影响吗？” \n “我倒不是担心那一点，先生，”公证人说道，“而是要先弄清他的思想才能引出他的回答，困难在这里。” \n “您也看出这是没法办到的事了。” \n 瓦朗蒂娜和老人都听到了这一段谈话；诺瓦蒂埃又目光急切地看着瓦朗蒂娜，以致她觉得必须挺身而出。 \n “阁下，”她说道，“这件事乍看起来似乎是很困难，但您尽管放心好了。我可以弄清我祖父的思想，并可以解释给您听，以消除您的一切疑虑。我和诺瓦蒂埃先生相处已六年了，让他对您说吧，在那段期间里，有没有过哪次我不清楚他脑子里是怎么想的。 \n “没有。”老人表示。 \n “那么好吧，我们且来试试看吧，看我们能做些什么，”公证人说道，“您接受这位小姐为您做解释吗，诺瓦蒂埃先生？” \n 那瘫子老人作了一个肯定的表示。 \n “好吧，先生，您要我来做什么，您想立什么字据吗？” \n 瓦朗蒂娜又打开了字母，当背到Ｔ这个母时，诺瓦蒂埃以目光示意她停止。 \n “诺瓦蒂埃先生所要的东西显然是以Ｔ字母打头的。”公证人说道。 \n “等一等，”瓦朗蒂娜说道，她转向她的祖父，继续背道，“Ｔａ—Ｔｅ。” \n 老人听到她背到第二组字母时就止住了她。于是瓦朗蒂娜拿过字典，在公证人的目光下翻动着。她用手指慢慢地一行一行地在书页上移过去，当指到“Ｔｅｓｔａｍｅｎｔ（遗嘱）”这个字时，诺瓦蒂埃先生的以目光吩咐她停住。“遗嘱！”公证人大声说道，“这已经很明白了，诺瓦蒂埃先生要立他的遗嘱。” \n “是的，是的，是的！”那不中用的老人表示。 \n “真的，阁下，您得承认这实在是太奇特了。”那惊诧不已的公证人转身对维尔福先生说道。 \n “是的，”检察官说道，“我想那份遗嘱一定会更奇特的，因为依我看，这份遗嘱要是没有瓦朗蒂娜的参与，简直就无法起草，而她与遗嘱的内容又有着急切的利害关系，所以由她来解释她祖父那种模糊不清的意思，该不能算作是个合适的人选吧。” \n \n \n “不，不，不！”那瘫子老人的目光回答。 \n “什么！”维尔福说道，“瓦朗蒂娜不能在你的遗嘱里得到利益吗？” \n “不。” \n “阁下，”公证人说道，这件事已引起了他极大的兴趣，他已决定要极大地扩展这个奇特的场面，“我在一小时已前还以为极不可能的事，现在已是很容易实现的。这份遗嘱，只要在七个证人面前宣读过以后，经遗言人的确认，再由公证人当着证人的面密封起来，就可以完全奏效了。至于时间，它当然要比立两份普通的遗嘱更费时一些。立遗嘱必须经过某些程序，但那些程序总是千篇一律的。至于细节，我们可以根据遗言人的事业状况来拟订，在这方面，您以前曾亲自经手过，无疑的还可以为我们提供帮助。除了这些以外，为了免得将来为手续问题再起争论，我们应当使它尽可能的准确无误，所以我当请一位同僚来帮助我。立遗嘱本来一向都不必有人协助的，但这次不妨破一次例。”公证人继续向老人说道，“您满意了吗，阁下？” \n “是的。”那老人的目光在说，他很高兴别人能懂得他的意思。 \n “他要想干什么呀？”维尔福心里在想，按他的地位，他原是不能过问的，但他却极想知道他父亲的心思。他走了出去吩咐再找一个公证人来，却不知巴罗斯早已经找去了，因为他听到了公证人的那番话，并早已猜中了他主人的心思。检察官于是叫他的妻子前来。不到一刻钟，所召的人都聚集到那瘫子老人的房间里来了。第二个公证人也来到了。两位公证人只讲了几句话就互相明白了对方。他们拿出一份正式遗嘱的副本读给诺瓦蒂埃听，以便他对这类文件的一般条款有个大致的概念，然后，为了测验一个遗言人的能力，那第一位公证人就对他说道：“当一个人立遗嘱的时候，一般来说，总是有利或有损于某一个人的。” \n “是的。”诺瓦蒂埃表示。 \n “您对于您财产的数目有没有一个确切的数字？” \n “有的。” \n “我向您提几个数目，然后逐渐增加。当我讲到您的财产的那个数目的时，您就止住我，好不好？” \n “好的。” \n 在这一段对话期间，房间里的气氛很庄严。精神与物质之间的斗争，再也没有比现在这样更明显的了；这种情景即使不能称之为崇高，至少也够得上称为稀奇。他们在老人周围围成了一个圆圈；第二位公证人坐在一张桌子前面，准备笔录，他的同僚则站在遗言人的前面，准备问他刚才说过的那个问题。“您的财产超过了三十万法郎，是不是？”他说。诺瓦蒂埃表示的确是的。“是四十万法郎吗？”公证人问。诺瓦蒂埃的目光没动。“五十万？”仍旧没动。“六十万？七十万？八十万？九十万？”当他提到最后那个数目的时候，诺瓦蒂埃止住了他。 \n “那么您有九十万法郎罗？”公证人问。 \n “是的。” \n “是地产？” \n “不是。” \n “证券？” \n “是的。” \n “证券在您手里吗？” \n “诺瓦蒂埃先生向巴罗斯望了一眼，表示他需要某种东西，而那个东西他知道可以到哪儿去找。那老仆人走出了房间，立刻带着一只小箱子回来了。 \n “您允许我们打开这只箱子吗？”公证人问。诺瓦蒂埃表示可以。他们打开了箱子，找到了写有九十万法郎的银行存单。第一位公证人一边逐张察看，一边递给他的同僚。总数与诺瓦蒂埃所说的完全相符。 \n “他说得一点不错，”第一位公证人说道，“他的脑子看来根本没问题，这是显而易见的了。”于是他转过身去对那老人说道，“那么，您有九十万法郎的原始资金，根据您的投资方式，它应该能产生四万里弗左右的收入是吗？” \n “是的。” \n “您愿意把这笔财产给谁？” \n “噢！”维尔福夫人说道，“这事再清楚不过了。诺瓦蒂埃先生极疼爱他的孙女儿维尔福小姐，她服侍了他六年，她很孝顺地照顾他，所以她的祖父很爱她，甚至几乎可以说很感激她，现在她可以享受孝顺所带来的好处了，这原是很公平的。” \n 诺瓦蒂埃眼睛里的表情清楚地表明他并没有被维尔福夫人那一篇虚情假意的话所欺骗。 \n “那么，您要把这九十万法郎遗赠给瓦朗蒂娜·维尔福小姐是吗？”公证人问道，他以为这一条马上就可以填上去了，只等诺瓦蒂埃的认可了，而这必须在全体证人面前得以确认。 \n 瓦朗蒂娜在他们提到她的名字时早已退到了后面以逃避那些向她投来的令人不愉快的注视；她的眼睛低垂着，她在嘤嘤地哭泣。老人带着一种极亲切的表情望了她一会儿，然后他转向公证人，深意地眨眨睛，表示不对。 \n “什么！”公证人说道，“您并不想立瓦朗蒂娜·维尔福小姐做您的遗产继承人是吗？” \n “是的。” \n “您没弄错吗？”公证人说道，“您的意思真的是‘不立她’吗？” \n “是的！”诺瓦蒂埃再次表示，“是的！” \n 瓦朗蒂娜抬起头来，惊愕得目瞪口呆。她倒并非因得不到遗产而悲伤，而是因为她根本想不出有什么地方触怒了她的祖父，以致他竟做出这样的举动来；诺瓦蒂埃满含亲切温柔的情意望着她，她一下子明白了，大声说道：“噢，爷爷！ \n 我明白了，您只是不把您的财产给我罢了，但我一向享受的爱，您还是给我的。” \n “啊，是的，那是当然的！”那老人的眼睛说，因为他闭眼睛时的那种表情瓦朗蒂娜是不会弄错的。 \n “谢谢您！谢谢您！”她轻轻地说道。 \n 老人宣布不立瓦朗蒂娜做他的财产继承人引起了维尔福夫人的希望。她走到老人的身旁，说道：“那么，亲爱的诺瓦蒂埃先生，您无疑的是准备把您的财产留给您的孙子爱德华·维尔福的了。” \n 回答她这一番话的是一阵最坚决可怕的眨眼，他所表示的那种情感几乎已近于憎恨。 \n “不是，”公证人说道，“那么大概是给您儿子维尔福先生的了？” \n “不。”老人回答。 \n 两位公证人都惊愕得哑口无言，面面相觑。此时维尔福和他的妻子都面红耳赤，前者是由于羞，后者由于恨。 \n “那么，我们大家究竟做错了什么事，亲爱的爷爷？”瓦朗蒂娜说，“您好象对我们谁都不爱啦。”老人的目光急速地从维尔福转到他的妻子，然后带着一种无恨钟爱的表情停留在瓦朗蒂娜身上。“哦，”她说道，“假如您爱我的话，爷爷，就在现在这个时候请用您的行动来证明吧。您对我很了解，您知道我从未想过您的财产，而且，他们说我继承我母亲的财产以后就已经很富有了——甚至太富有了。请您解释一下吧。” \n 诺瓦蒂埃把那聪慧的目光盯住了瓦朗蒂娜的手。 \n “我的手？”她说道。 \n \n “是的。” \n “她的手！”每个人都大声叫道。 \n “噢，诸位！你们看，这一切都是在白费心思，我父亲的脑筋实在是有问题了。”维尔福说道。 \n “啊！”瓦朗蒂娜突然大声说道，“我懂啦！你的意思是指我的婚事，是吗，亲爱的爷爷？” \n “是的，是的，是的。”那老人表示，并高兴地向瓦朗蒂娜投去一个感谢的目光，感谢她猜出了他的意思。 \n “您为这桩婚事生我们大家的气，是不是？” \n “是的。” \n “真的，这太荒唐了。”维尔福说道。 \n “原谅我，阁下，”公证人答道，“依我看，正巧相反，诺瓦蒂埃先生的意思很清楚，我可以很容易地把他脑子里的那些想法串起来。” \n “您不愿意我嫁给弗兰兹·伊皮奈先生是吗？”瓦朗蒂娜说。 \n “我不愿意。”她祖父的目光说。 \n “所以您才不把遗产留给您的孙女儿，”公证人又说，“就是因为她结了一门违背您心愿的亲事，是不是？” \n “是的。” \n “所以要不是为了这门亲事，她本来是可以做您的继承人的是吧？” \n “是的。” \n 房间里顿时雅雀无声。两位公证人凑在一起商量着，瓦朗蒂娜紧扭着双手，带着感激的微笑望着她的祖父；维尔福则烦恼地咬着嘴唇；维尔福夫人则抑制不住内心的欢喜，不自觉地现出得意神态。 \n “可是，”维尔福首先打破沉寂说道，“我认为那桩婚事的好与坏，我是最好的判断者。我是唯一有权可以决定我女儿婚事的人。我想要她嫁给弗兰兹·伊皮奈先生，她就一定要嫁给他！” \n 瓦朗蒂娜哭着倒在了一张椅子上。 \n “先生，”公证人说，“假如维尔福小姐仍然决定要嫁给弗兰兹先生，您准备如何处置您的财产呢？” \n 老人不回答。 \n “您肯定要用某种方式来处置它罗？” \n “是的。” \n “是传给您家里的某一个人吗？” \n “不是。” \n “那么，您是预备把它专用在慈善事业上吗？”公证人追问。 \n “是的。” \n “但是，”公证人说，“您知道吗，法律是不允许一个儿子的继承权全部被剥夺的？” \n “是的。” \n “那么，您准备只送掉法律允许您转让的那部分财产吗？” \n 诺瓦蒂埃没回答。 \n “您仍然是希望把全部都送掉吗？” \n “是的。” \n “但在您去世以后，那份遗嘱会引起争论的。” \n “不。” \n “家父是了解我的，”维尔福说道，“他很清楚我会神圣地去实现他的希望。我是死了心的了。这九十万法郎应当脱离这个家，随便让哪家医院去发财好了，我决不愿向一个老人的怪想法让步。我当根据我的良心行事。” \n 说完了这一番话，维尔福就和他的妻子走出了房间，让他的父亲称心如意地去处理他自己的事情。那份遗嘱当天就立好了，公证人把证人找来，经老人认可，当众把它封好，交给了家庭律师狄思康先生保管。 \n \n
