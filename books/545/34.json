{"id":43902,"no":34,"title":"Chapter 38 The Compact","content":"THE FIRST WORDS that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following morning, contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit to the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged. Franz, who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count, in which terror was strangely mingled, felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him, and therefore made no objection to Albert\u0027s request, but at once accompanied him to the desired spot, and, after a short delay, the count joined them in the salon. \"My dear count,\" said Albert, advancing to meet him, \"permit me to repeat the poor thanks I offered last night, and to assure you that the remembrance of all I owe to you will never be effaced from my memory; believe me, as long as I live, I shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me; and also to remember that to you I am indebted even for my life.\" \"My very good friend and excellent neighbor,\" replied the count, with a smile, \"you really exaggerate my trifling exertions. You owe me nothing but some trifle of 20,000 francs, which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses, so that there is not much of a score between us;--but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate, and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take.\" \"Upon my word,\" said Albert, \"I deserve no credit for what I could not help, namely, a determination to take everything as I found it, and to let those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world, there is no nation but the French that can smile even in the face of grim Death himself. All that, however, has nothing to do with my obligations to you, and I now come to ask you whether, in my own person, my family, or connections, I can in any way serve you? My father, the Comte de Morcerf, although of Spanish origin, possesses considerable influence, both at the court of France and Madrid, and I unhesitatingly place the best services of myself, and all to whom my life is dear, at your disposal.\" \"Monsieur de Morcerf,\" replied the count, \"your offer, far from surprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;--nay, I will go still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands.\" \"Oh, pray name it.\" \"I am wholly a stranger to Paris--it is a city I have never yet seen.\" \"Is it possible,\" exclaimed Albert, \"that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world? I can scarcely credit it.\" \"Nevertheless, it is quite true; still, I agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach to me in every way, and calls for immediate correction; but, in all probability, I should have performed so important, so necessary a duty, as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital, had I known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world, but unfortunately I possessed no acquaintance there, and, of necessity, was compelled to abandon the idea.\" \"So distinguished an individual as yourself,\" cried Albert, \"could scarcely have required an introduction.\" \"You are most kind; but as regards myself, I can find no merit I possess, save that, as a millionaire, I might have become a partner in the speculations of M. Aguado and M. Rothschild; but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks, I stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution. Your offer, however, smooths all difficulties, and I have only to ask you, my dear M. de Morcerf\" (these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile), \"whether you undertake, upon my arrival in France, to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a Huron or a native of Cochin-China?\" \"Oh, that I do, and with infinite pleasure,\" answered Albert; \"and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to Paris, in consequence of a treaty of marriage (my dear Franz, do not smile, I beg of you) with a family of high standing, and connected with the very cream of Parisian society.\" \"Connected by marriage, you mean,\" said Franz, laughingly. \"Well, never mind how it is,\" answered Albert, \"it comes to the same thing in the end. Perhaps by the time you return to Paris, I shall be quite a sober, staid father of a family! A most edifying representative I shall make of all the domestic virtues--don\u0027t you think so? But as regards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear count, I can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please.\" \"Then it is settled,\" said the count, \"and I give you my solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that I have long meditated.\" Franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and while the Count was speaking the young man watched him closely, hoping to read something of his purpose in his face, but his countenance was inscrutable especially when, as in the present case, it was veiled in a sphinx-like smile. \"But tell me now, count,\" exclaimed Albert, delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as Monte Cristo; \"tell me truly whether you are in earnest, or if this project of visiting Paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives, but which, like a house built on the sand, is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind?\" \"I pledge you my honor,\" returned the count, \"that I mean to do as I have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit Paris.\" \"When do you propose going thither?\" \"Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?\" \"Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks\u0027 time, that is to say, as fast as I can get there!\" \"Nay,\" said the Count; \"I will give you three months ere I join you; you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties. \"And in three months\u0027 time,\" said Albert, \"you will be at my house?\" \"Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?\" inquired the count; \"only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.\" \"Day for day, hour for hour,\" said Albert; \"that will suit me to a dot.\" \"So be it, then,\" replied the count, and extending his hand towards a calendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, \"to-day is the 21st of February;\" and drawing out his watch, added, \"it is exactly half-past ten o\u0027clock. Now promise me to remember this, and expect me the 21st of May at the same hour in the forenoon.\" \"Capital,\" exclaimed Albert; \"your breakfast shall be waiting.\" \"Where do you live?\" \"No. 27, Rue du Helder.\" \"Have you bachelor\u0027s apartments there? I hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience.\" \"I reside in my father\u0027s house, but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the court-yard, entirely separated from the main building.\" \"Quite sufficient,\" replied the count, as, taking out his tablets, he wrote down \"No. 27, Rue du Helder, 21st May, half-past ten in the morning.\" \"Now then,\" said the count, returning his tablets to his pocket, \"make yourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time-piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself.\" \"Shall I see you again ere my departure?\" asked Albert. \"That depends; when do you leave?\" \"To-morrow evening, at five o\u0027clock.\" \"In that case I must say adieu to you, as I am compelled to go to Naples, and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday morning. And you, baron,\" pursued the count, addressing Franz, \"do you also depart to-morrow?\" \"Yes.\" \"For France?\" \"No, for Venice; I shall remain in Italy for another year or two.\" \"Then we shall not meet in Paris?\" \"I fear I shall not have that honor.\" \"Well, since we must part,\" said the count, holding out a hand to each of the young men, \"allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey.\" It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him, and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch, for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse. \"Let us understand each other,\" said Albert; \"it is agreed--is it not?--that you are to be at No. 27, in the Rue du Helder, on the 21st of May, at half-past ten in the morning, and your word of honor passed for your punctuality?\" \"The 21st of May, at half-past ten in the morning, Rue du Helder, No. 27,\" replied the Count. The young men then rose, and bowing to the count, quitted the room. \"What is the matter?\" asked Albert of Franz, when they had returned to their own apartments; \"you seem more than commonly thoughtful.\" \"I will confess to you, Albert,\" replied Franz, \"the count is a very singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions.\" \"My dear fellow,\" exclaimed Albert, \"what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness? Why, you must have lost your senses.\" \"Whether I am in my senses or not,\" answered Franz, \"that is the way I feel.\" \"Listen to me, Franz,\" said Albert; \"I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you, for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count, while he, on the other hand, has always been courtesy itself to us. Have you anything particular against him?\" \"Possibly.\" \"Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?\" \"I have.\" \"And where?\" \"Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to tell you?\" \"I promise.\" \"Upon your honor?\" \"Upon my honor.\" \"Then listen to me.\" Franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there, and the two Corsican bandits with them. He dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count, and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the Thousand and One Nights. He recounted, with circumstantial exactitude, all the particulars of the supper, the hashish, the statues, the dream, and how, at his awakening, there remained no proof or trace of all these events, save the small yacht, seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward Porto-Vecchio. Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum, between the count and Vampa, in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit Peppino,--an engagement which, as our readers are aware, he most faithfully fulfilled. At last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night, and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required, and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed. Albert listened with the most profound attention. \"Well,\" said he, when Franz had concluded, \"what do you find to object to in all you have related? The count is fond of travelling, and, being rich, possesses a vessel of his own. Go but to Portsmouth or Southampton, and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the English as can afford the expense, and have the same liking for this amusement. Now, by way of having a resting-place during his excursions, avoiding the wretched cookery--which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months, while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years,--and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber, Monte Cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him; but, to prevent the possibility of the Tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace, and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital, he has wisely enough purchased the island, and taken its name. Just ask yourself, my good fellow, whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of?\" \"But,\" said Franz, \"the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel?\" \"Why, really the thing seems to me simple enough. Nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or thieves, but purely and simply fugitives, driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village, and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma; for my own part, I protest that, should I ever go to Corsica, my first visit, ere even I presented myself to the mayor or prefect, should be to the bandits of Colomba, if I could only manage to find them; for, on my conscience, they are a race of men I admire greatly.\" \"Still,\" persisted Franz, \"I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person. How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?\" \"My good friend, as in all probability I own my present safety to that influence, it would ill become me to search too closely into its source; therefore, instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws, you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection; not altogether for preserving my life, for my own idea was that it never was in much danger, but certainly for saving me 4,000 piastres, which, being translated, means neither more nor less than 24,000 livres of our money--a sum at which, most assuredly, I should never have been estimated in France, proving most indisputably,\" added Albert with a laugh, \"that no prophet is honored in his own country.\" \"Talking of countries,\" replied Franz, \"of what country is the count, what is his native tongue, whence does he derive his immense fortune, and what were those events of his early life--a life as marvellous as unknown--that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy? Certainly these are questions that, in your place, I should like to have answered.\" \"My dear Franz,\" replied Albert, \"when, upon receipt of my letter, you found the necessity of asking the count\u0027s assistance, you promptly went to him, saying, \u0027My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger; help me to deliver him.\u0027 Was not that nearly what you said?\" \"It was.\" \"Well, then, did he ask you, \u0027Who is M. Albert de Morcerf? how does he come by his name--his fortune? what are his means of existence? what is his birthplace! of what country is he a native?\u0027 Tell me, did he put all these questions to you?\" \"I confess he asked me none.\" \"No; he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa, where, I can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern, I did not very particularly care to remain. Now, then, Franz, when, for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered, he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian prince or Italian nobleman who may pass through Paris--merely to introduce him into society--would you have me refuse? My good fellow, you must have lost your senses to think it possible I could act with such cold-blooded policy.\" And this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective arguments were all on Albert\u0027s side. \"Well,\" said Franz with a sigh, \"do as you please my dear viscount, for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation. Still, in spite of all, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular personage.\" \"He is a philanthropist,\" answered the other; \"and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity. If my vote and interest can obtain it for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the other. And now, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else. Come, shall we take our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to St. Peter\u0027s?\" Franz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five o\u0027clock, the young men parted. Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, and Franz d\u0027Epinay to pass a fortnight at Venice. But, ere he entered his travelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo, on which, beneath the name of Vicomte Albert de Morcerf, he had written in pencil: 第二天早晨，阿尔贝一见到他的朋友，就要求他陪他去拜访伯爵。不错，前一天晚上，他已经恳切有力地谢过他一次了，但他帮了这么大的忙，是值得再去谢第二次的。弗兰兹觉得伯爵似乎有某种看不见的力量在吸引着他，而且其间还奇怪地夹杂着一种害怕的感觉，他极不愿意让他的朋友单独去这个人那里，于是便答应陪他去了。他们被引入客厅，五分钟之后，伯爵出现了。 “伯爵阁下，”阿尔贝迎向他说道，“请允许我今天上午向您重述一遍，昨天晚上我表达的谢意太笨劣了，我向您保证，我永远也不会忘记您给予我的所有帮助。我将永远记住您的恩德，甚至我的生命可以说也是您赐予的。” “亲爱的邻居，”伯爵微笑着回答说，“您把您欠我的情意未免太夸大了些吧。我除了为您在旅费里省下了约莫两万法郎以外，并没做什么别的事值得您如此感激。请接受我的祝贺，您昨天是那样的安闲自在。听天由命，我很敬佩。” “老实说，”阿尔贝说，“我对于自己无能为力的事是从不去枉费心机的，也就是说，随遇而安吧，我是要让那些强盗看看，虽然全世界各地都有人会遭遇到棘手的困境，却只有法兰西民族既便在狰狞的死神面前还能微笑。但那一切，与我所欠您的恩情毫无关系，我这次来是想来问问您，不论我个人，我的家庭，或我的其它方面的关系，能否有什么可以为您效劳的。家父马尔塞夫伯爵，虽然原籍是西班牙人，但在法国和马德里两个宫廷里都有相当的势力，我可以向您保证，我和所有那些爱我的人，都愿意尽力为您效劳。 “马尔塞夫先生，”伯爵答道，“您的好意我心领了，我真心实意地接受了，您既然提出这样真诚恳切的请求，我倒是真的决定要请您帮一个大忙呢。” “什么事？” “我从未到过巴黎，我到现在还很不熟悉这个都市。” “这怎么可能呢？”阿尔贝惊叫道，“您生活到现在居然从未去过巴黎？我简直难以相信。” “可是这的确是真的，我同意您的想法，我到现在还不曾去见识一下这个欧洲的第一大都市，确是一件不可饶恕的事。只是我和那个社会毫无关系，要是以前我能认识一个可以给我引荐的人，我或许早就作一次重要的旅行了。” “噢！象您这样的人！”阿尔贝大声说道。 “您太过奖了，但我觉得自己除了能和阿加多先生或罗斯希尔德先生这些百万富翁一争高低以外，别无所长，我到巴黎又不是去做投机生意的，所以迟迟未去。现在您的好意使我下了决心。这样吧，我亲爱的马尔塞夫先生（这几个字是带着一个极古怪的微笑说的），我一到法国，就由您负责为我打开那个时髦社会的大门，因为我对于那个地方，象对印第安人或印度支那人一样知之甚少。” “噢，那一点我完全可以办得到，而且非常高兴！”阿尔贝回答说，“更巧的是，今天早晨我接到家父的一封信，召我回巴黎，是关于我与一个可爱的家庭结合的事情（我亲爱的弗兰兹，请你别笑），而那个家庭也是地位很高，是那种所谓巴黎社会的精华。” “婚姻关系吗？”弗兰兹大笑着说。 “上帝保佑，是的！”阿尔贝回答说，“所以当你回到巴黎的时候，你会发觉我已经安顿下来，或许已成了一家之主了。那很符合我严肃的天性，是不是？但无论如何，伯爵，我再说一遍，我和我的家人都会全身心地为您效劳的。” “我接受了，”伯爵说道，“因为我可以向您发誓，我早就想好了几个计划，就等这样一个机会的到来使之实现了。” “弗兰兹怀疑这些计划是否和他在基督山的岩洞里所透露出的那一点口风有关，所以当伯爵说话的时候，这位青年仔细地观察着他，希望能从他脸上看到一点蛛丝马迹，究竟是什么计划促使他到巴黎去。但要看透那个人的心是非常困难的，尤其当他用一个微笑来掩饰着的时候。 “请告诉我，伯爵，”阿尔贝大声说道，他想到能介绍一位象基督山伯爵这样出色的人物，心里高兴，“请实话告诉我，您访问巴黎的这个计划，究竟是出于真心呢，还是那种我们在人生旅途中逢场作戏常许的空愿，象一座建筑在沙堆上的房屋一样，被风一吹就倒了？” “我以人格向您担保，”伯爵答道，“我说过的话的确是要实行的。我到巴黎去，一方面是出于心愿，一方面也是由于绝对的必要，所以不得不去。” “您有没有决定您自己什么时候回到那儿？” “我当然决定了，两三个星期之内。就是说，能多快就多快回到那儿！” “好的，”伯爵说道，“我给您三个月的时间。您瞧，我给您的期限是很宽的。” “三个月之内，”阿尔贝说道，“您就可以到我的家里？” “我们要不要确确实实地来定一个日子和时间呢？”伯爵问道，“只是我得先警告您，我是极其遵守时间的哪。” “妙极了，妙极了！“阿尔贝大声说道，“准时守约那最合我的胃口了。” “那么，就这么一言为定了，”伯爵答道，然后他用手指着挂在壁炉架旁边的一个日历，说道，“今天是二月二十一日，”又掏出他的表来，说道，“恰巧十点半钟。现在，请答应我记着这一点：请在五月二十日上午十点半钟等着我。” “太好了！”阿尔贝说道，“我到时一定准备好早餐恭候您。” “您住在什么地方？” “海尔达路二十七号。” “您在那儿住单身吗？我希望我的到来不会妨碍您。” “我住在家父的府邸里，独占庭园侧边一座楼，和正屋是完全隔离的。” “很好，”伯爵回答，一面摸出他怀中的记事册来，写下了“五月二十一日早晨十点半，海尔达路二十七号”。“现在，”他一边把记事册放回到口袋里，一边说道，“您只管放心吧，您的挂钟的针是不会比我更加准时的。” “我离开之前还能再见到您吗？”阿尔贝问道。 “那得看情形而定，您什么时候动身？” “明天傍晚五点钟。” “那样，我必须跟您告别了，因为我不得不到那不勒斯去一趟，星期六晚上或星期天早晨以前不会回来。您呢，男爵阁下，”伯爵又向弗兰兹说道，“您也明天离开吗？” “是的。” “到法国去？” “不，去威尼斯，我在意大利还得呆一两年。” “那么我们不能在巴黎相会了？” “恐怕我不能有那个荣幸了。” “好吧，既然我们必须分离了，”伯爵伸手和两个青年每人握了一次，“请允许我祝愿你们二位旅途平安愉快。” 弗兰兹的手是第一次和这个神秘的人接触，当两手相触的时候，他下意识地打了一个寒颤，因为他觉得那只手冰冷冰冷的，象是一具尸身上的手似的。 “我们把话已讲明了，”阿尔贝说道，“说定了，是不是？您在五月二十一日早晨十点半钟到海尔达路，而且您是以人格担保一定守时的？” “讲定的这一切都以人格担保，”伯爵回答说，“放心好了，您一定可以在约定的时间和地点看到我的。” 两个青年于是站起身来，向伯爵鞠了一躬，离开了那个房间。 “怎么啦？”当他们回到自己的房间里以后，阿尔贝问弗兰兹，“你似乎心事重重的。” “我坦白地告诉你吧，阿尔贝，”弗兰兹答道，“我正在费尽心机地想搞清楚这位古怪的伯爵的真正来历，而你和他订期在巴黎相见的那个约会真使我非常担忧。” “我亲爱的，”阿尔贝惊道，“那件事有什么使你不安呢？咦，你疯啦！” “随便你怎么说吧，”弗兰兹说道，“疯不疯，事实如此。” “听我说，弗兰兹，”阿尔贝说道，“我很高兴借这个机会来告诉你，我注意到了，你对伯爵的态度显然很冷淡，但从另一方面讲，他对我们的态度可说是十全十美的了。你为什么不喜欢他呢？” “这必有原因的。” “你在到这儿来以前，曾遇到过他吗？” “遇到过。” “在什么地方？” “你能不能答应我，我讲给你听的事，一个字都不要传出去？” “我答应。” “以人格担保？” “以人格担保。” “那我就满意了，那么听着。” 弗兰兹于是向他的朋友叙述了那次到基督山岛去游历的经过，以及如何在那儿发现了一群走私贩子，如何有两个科西嘉强盗和他们在一起等等。他很卖力地叙述了如何得到伯爵那次几乎象变魔术似的款待，如何在那《一千零一夜》的岩洞里受到他富丽堂皇的房宅里的招待。他毫无保留地详述了那一次晚餐——大麻，石像，梦和现实；如何在他醒来的时候所发生的一切都不曾留下一丝痕迹，而只见那艘小游艇在远远的地平线上向韦基奥港驶去。接着他又详述了他在斗兽场里偷听到伯爵和万帕的那一席谈话，伯爵如何在那次谈话里许诺为庇皮诺那个强盗设法弄到赦罪令。这个协定，读者当然明白，他是最忠实地完成了的。最后，他讲到前一天晚上的那个奇遇，他为了六七百毕阿士特，如何感到为难，如何想起请伯爵帮忙的那个念兴所带来的圆满结果。 阿尔贝全神贯注地倾听着。“嗯，”他等弗兰兹讲完后说道，“就从你所讲的这种种事情上来看，他又有什么可讨厌的地方呢？伯爵喜欢旅行，因为有钱，所以自己买了条船。你到朴茨茅斯或索斯安普敦瞧瞧去吧，你会发现港口里挤满了游艇，都是属于这种有同样癖好的英国富翁的。而为了在他旅行的途中有一个休息的地方，为了逃避那种毒害我们的可怕的饭菜——我吃了四个月，你吃了四年，这了避免睡这种谁都无法入睡的讨厌的床铺，他在基督山安置了一个窝。然后，当他把地方安排好以后，他又怕托斯卡纳政府会把他赶走，使他白白损失那一笔安置费，所以他买下了那个岛，并袭用了小岛的名字。你且自问一下，亲爱的人，在我们相识的人里面，不是也有用地名或产业的名字命名的吗？而那些地方或产业，他们生平不是从来不曾拥有过的吗？” “但是，”弗兰兹说道，“科西喜强盗和他的船员混在一起，这件事你又怎么解释呢？” “哎，那件事有什么可大惊小怪的呢？谁都没有你知道得更清楚啦，科西嘉强盗并不是流氓或贼，而纯粹是为亲友复仇才被本乡赶出来的亡命者，和他们交朋友没什么见不得人的；因为以我自己而论，我可以明目张胆地说，假如我一旦去访问科西嘉，那么我在拜访总督或县长之前，一定先去拜访一下哥伦白的强盗，当然要是我能设法和他们相会的话。我觉得他们是很有趣的。” “可是，”弗兰兹坚持说，“我想你大概也承认，象万帕和他的喽罗们这种人，可都是些流氓恶棍，当他们把你抢去的时候，除了绑票勒索以外，该没有别的动机了吧。而伯爵竟能有力量左右那些暴徒，这一点你又怎么解释啊？” “我的好朋友，我现在的平安多半得归功于那种力量，这件事我不应该太刨根问底。所以，你不能要求我来责备他和不法之徒之间的这种密切关系，而应该让我原谅他在这种关系上越礼的细节，这倒决非是因为他保全了我的性命，而因为依我看，我的性命是不会有什么危险的，倒是给我省下了四千毕阿士特，四千毕阿特，换成我国的钱，要相当于两万四千里弗。这笔数目，要是我在法国被绑票是肯定不会被估的这么高的，这完全证实了那句俗话，”阿尔贝大笑着说，“没有一个预言家能在他的本国受到尊崇。” “谈到国籍，”弗兰兹答道，“伯爵究竟是哪国人呢？他的本族语又是哪一种语言呢？他靠什么生活？他这种庞大的财产是从哪儿得来的呢？他的生活是这样的神秘莫测，在他的前期生活中，曾发生过什么大事，以致使他在后来岁月中抱有这样黑暗阴郁的一种厌世观呢？假如我处在你的位置，这些问题我当然是希望能得到解答的。” “我亲爱的弗兰兹，”阿尔贝回答说，“当你收到我那封信，觉得必须请伯爵帮忙的时候，你就立刻到他那儿去了，说，‘我的朋友阿尔贝·马尔塞夫遇险了，请帮助我去救他出来吧。’你是否是这样说的？” “是的。” “好了，那么，他有没有问你，‘阿尔贝·马尔塞夫先生是谁，他的爵位，他的财产是从哪儿来的，他靠什么生活，他的出生地点在什么地方，他是哪国人？’请告诉我，他有没有问你这种种问题？” “我承认他一点都没有问我。” “不，他只是把我从万帕先生的手里救了出来，我老实告诉你，虽然当时我在表面上极其安闲自在，但我实在是很不愿意久留在那种地方。现在，弗兰兹，他既然这样毫不犹豫迅速地为我效劳，而他所求的报酬，只是要我尽一种很平常的义务，象我对经过巴黎的任何俄国亲王或意大利贵族所效的微劳一样，只要我介绍他进入社交界就行了，你能忍心让我拒绝他吗？我的老朋友，要是你以为我可能实行这种冷血动物的政策，你一定是神经有问题啦。”这一次，我必须承认，竟一反往常，有力的论据都在阿尔贝这一边。 “好吧，”弗兰兹叹了一口气说道，“你随便吧，我亲爱的子爵，因为我无力反驳你的论据，但无论如何，这位基督山伯爵总是一个怪人。” “他是一个博爱主义者，”对方答道，“他访问巴黎的动机无疑是要去争取蒙松奖章。假如我有投票权而且能左右选举的话，我一定投他一票，并答应替他活动其他的选票。现在，亲爱的弗兰兹，我们来谈些别的吧。来，我们先吃了午餐，然后到圣·彼得教堂去做最后一次的访问好不好？”弗兰兹默默地点头答应了；第二天下午五点半，两个青年分手了。阿尔贝·马尔塞夫回巴黎，而弗兰兹·伊皮奈则到威尼斯去，准备到那儿去住两个星期。但阿尔贝在钻进他的旅行马车之前，由于怕那位客人忘记了他的约定，又递了一张名片给旅馆的侍从，托他转交给基督山伯爵，在那张名片上，他在阿尔贝·马尔塞夫的名字底下用铅笔写着：“五月二十一日上午十时半，海尔达路二十七号。”
