{"id":43938,"no":70,"title":"Chapter 75 A Signed Statement","content":"NOIRTIER was prepared to receive them, dressed in black, and installed in his arm-chair. When the three persons he expected had entered, he looked at the door, which his valet immediately closed. \"Listen,\" whispered Villefort to Valentine, who could not conceal her joy; \"if M. Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage, I forbid you to understand him.\" Valentine blushed, but did not answer. Villefort, approaching Noirtier--\"Here is M. Franz d\u0027Epinay,\" said he; \"you requested to see him. We have all wished for this interview, and I trust it will convince you how ill-formed are your objections to Valentine\u0027s marriage.\" Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villefort\u0027s blood run cold. He motioned to Valentine to approach. In a moment, thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather, she understood that he asked for a key. Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows. She opened the drawer, and found a key; and, understanding that was what he wanted, again watched his eyes, which turned toward an old secretary which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents. \"Shall I open the secretary?\" asked Valentine. \"Yes,\" said the old man. \"And the drawers?\" \"Yes.\" \"Those at the side?\" \"No.\" \"The middle one?\" \"Yes.\" Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers. \"Is that what you wish for?\" asked she. \"No.\" She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty. \"But there are no more,\" said she. Noirtier\u0027s eye was fixed on the dictionary. \"Yes, I understand, grandfather,\" said the young girl. \"He pointed to each letter of the alphabet. At the letter S the old man stopped her. She opened, and found the word \"secret.\" \"Ah, is there a secret spring?\" said Valentine. \"Yes,\" said Noirtier. \"And who knows it?\" Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out. \"Barrois?\" said she. \"Yes.\" \"Shall I call him?\" \"Yes.\" Valentine went to the door, and called Barrois. Villefort\u0027s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead, and Franz was stupefied. The old servant came. \"Barrois,\" said Valentine, \"my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretary, but there is a secret spring in it, which you know--will you open it?\" Barrois looked at the old man. \"Obey,\" said Noirtier\u0027s intelligent eye. Barrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string. \"Is that what you wish for?\" said Barrois. \"Yes.\" \"Shall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?\" \"No.\" \"To Mademoiselle Valentine?\" \"No.\" \"To M. Franz d\u0027Epinay?\" \"Yes.\" Franz, astonished, advanced a step. \"To me, sir?\" said he. \"Yes.\" Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover, read:-- \"\u0027To be given, after my death, to General Durand, who shall bequeath the packet to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document.\u0027 \"Well, sir,\" asked Franz, \"what do you wish me to do with this paper?\" \"To preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless,\" said the procureur. \"No,\" replied Noirtier eagerly. \"Do you wish him to read it?\" said Valentine. \"Yes,\" replied the old man. \"You understand, baron, my grandfather wishes you to read this paper,\" said Valentine. \"Then let us sit down,\" said Villefort impatiently, \"for it will take some time.\" \"Sit down,\" said the old man. Villefort took a chair, but Valentine remained standing by her father\u0027s side, and Franz before him, holding the mysterious paper in his hand. \"Read,\" said the old man. Franz untied it, and in the midst of the most profound silence read: \"\u0027Extract from the Report of a meeting of the Bonapartist Club in the Rue Saint-Jacques, held February 5th, 1815.\u0027\" Franz stopped. \"February 5th, 1815!\" said he; \"it is the day my father was murdered.\" Valentine and Villefort were dumb; the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly, \"Go on.\" \"But it was on leaving this club,\" said he, \"my father disappeared.\" Noirtier\u0027s eye continued to say, \"Read.\" He resumed:-- \"\u0027The undersigned Louis Jacques Beaurepaire, lieutenant-colonel of artillery, Etienne Duchampy, general of brigade, and Claude Lecharpal, keeper of woods and forests, Declare, that on the 4th of February, a letter arrived from the Island of Elba, recommending to the kindness and the confidence of the Bonapartist Club, General Flavien de Quesnel, who having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to be devoted to the interests of the Napoleon dynasty, notwithstanding the title of baron which Louis XVIII had just granted to him with his estate of Epinay. \"\u0027A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel, begging him to be present at the meeting next day, the 5th. The note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held; it bore no signature, but it announced to the general that some one would call for him if he would be ready at nine o\u0027clock. The meetings were always held from that time till midnight. At nine o\u0027clock the president of the club presented himself; the general was ready, the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting, and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged, swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage. General de Quesnel accepted the condition, and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took. The general\u0027s carriage was ready, but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it, since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went. \"What must be done then?\" asked the general.--\"I have my carriage here,\" said the president. \"\u0027\"Have you, then, so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know?\" \"\u0027\"Our coachman is a member of the club,\" said the president; \"we shall be driven by a State-Councillor.\" \"\u0027\"Then we run another risk,\" said the general, laughing, \"that of being upset.\" We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting, but that he came willingly. When they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged, to which he made no opposition. On the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief, and reminded him of his oath. \"Sure enough,\" said the general. The carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue Saint-Jacques. The general alighted, leaning on the arm of the president, of whose dignity he was not aware, considering him simply as a member of the club; they went through the alley, mounted a flight of stairs, and entered the assembly-room. \"\u0027\"The deliberations had already begun. The members, apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening, were all in attendance. When in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage, he did so immediately, and was surprised to see so many well-known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant. They questioned him as to his sentiments, but he contented himself with answering, that the letters from the Island of Elba ought to have informed them\u0027\"-- Franz interrupted himself by saying, \"My father was a royalist; they need not have asked his sentiments, which were well known.\" \"And hence,\" said Villefort, \"arose my affection for your father, my dear M. Franz. Opinions held in common are a ready bond of union.\" \"Read again,\" said the old man. Franz continued:-- \"\u0027The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly, but M. de Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him. He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of Elba, in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party. One paragraph spoke of the return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further details, on the arrival of the Pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder Morrel, of Marseilles, whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor. During all this time, the general, on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother, manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance. When the reading was finished, he remained silent, with knitted brows. \"\u0027\"Well,\" asked the president, \"what do you say to this letter, general?\" \"\u0027\"I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XVIII to break my vow in behalf of the ex-emperor.\" This answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments. \"General,\" said the president, \"we acknowledge no King Louis XVIII, or an ex-emperor, but his majesty the emperor and king, driven from France, which is his kingdom, by violence and treason.\" \"\u0027\"Excuse me, gentlemen,\" said the general; \"you may not acknowledge Louis XVIII, but I do, as he has made me a baron and a field-marshal, and I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his happy return to France.\" \"\u0027\"Sir,\" said the president, rising with gravity, \"be careful what you say; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the Island of Elba, and have deceived us! The communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you, and which does you honor. Now we discover our error; a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn. We will not constrain you to help us; we enroll no one against his conscience, but we will compel you to act generously, even if you are not disposed to do so.\" \"\u0027\"You would call acting generously, knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you, that is what I should call becoming your accomplice. You see I am more candid than you.\"\u0027\" \"Ah, my father!\" said Franz, interrupting himself. \"I understand now why they murdered him.\" Valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man, whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold. Villefort walked to and fro behind them. Noirtier watched the expression of each one, and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude. Franz returned to the manuscript, and continued:-- \"\u0027\"Sir,\" said the president, \"you have been invited to join this assembly--you were not forced here; it was proposed to you to come blindfolded--you accepted. When you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XVIII, or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police. It would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret, and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you. No, no, you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns, or for his majesty the emperor.\" \"\u0027\"I am a royalist,\" replied the general; \"I have taken the oath of allegiance to Louis XVIII, and I will adhere to it.\" These words were followed by a general murmur, and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness. \"\u0027The president again arose, and having imposed silence, said,--\"Sir, you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation, and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you.\" The general, putting his hand on his sword, exclaimed,--\"If you talk of honor, do not begin by disavowing its laws, and impose nothing by violence.\" \"\u0027\"And you, sir,\" continued the president, with a calmness still more terrible than the general\u0027s anger, \"I advise you not to touch your sword.\" The general looked around him with slight uneasiness; however he did not yield, but calling up all his fortitude, said,--\"I will not swear.\" \"\u0027\"Then you must die,\" replied the president calmly. M. d\u0027Epinay became very pale; he looked round him a second time, several members of the club were whispering, and getting their arms from under their cloaks. \"General,\" said the president, \"do not alarm yourself; you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity, but as you have said, you are among conspirators, you are in possession of our secret, and you must restore it to us.\" A significant silence followed these words, and as the general did not reply,--\"Close the doors,\" said the president to the door-keeper. \"\u0027The same deadly silence succeeded these words. Then the general advanced, and making a violent effort to control his feelings,--\"I have a son,\" said he, \"and I ought to think of him, finding myself among assassins.\" \"\u0027\"General,\" said the chief of the assembly, \"one man may insult fifty--it is the privilege of weakness. But he does wrong to use his privilege. Follow my advice, swear, and do not insult.\" The general, again daunted by the superiority of the chief, hesitated a moment; then advancing to the president\u0027s desk,--\"What is the form, said he. \"\u0027\"It is this:--\u0027I swear by my honor not to reveal to any one what I have seen and heard on the 5th of February, 1815, between nine and ten o\u0027clock in the evening; and I plead guilty of death should I ever violate this oath.\u0027\" The general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor, which prevented his answering for some moments; then, overcoming his manifest repugnance, he pronounced the required oath, but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members, who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly, which he did. \"\u0027\"Now am I at liberty to retire?\" said the general. The president rose, appointed three members to accompany him, and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes. One of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there. The other members silently dispersed. \"Where do you wish to be taken?\" asked the president.--\"Anywhere out of your presence,\" replied M. d\u0027Epinay. \"Beware, sir,\" replied the president, \"you are no longer in the assembly, and have only to do with individuals; do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible.\" But instead of listening, M. d\u0027Epinay went on,--\"You are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one.\" The president stopped the coach. They were at that part of the Quai des Ormes where the steps lead down to the river. \"Why do you stop here?\" asked d\u0027Epinay. \"\u0027\"Because, sir,\" said the president, \"you have insulted a man, and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation.\" \"\u0027\"Another method of assassination?\" said the general, shrugging his shoulders. \"\u0027\"Make no noise, sir, unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards, who take their weakness for a shield. You are alone, one alone shall answer you; you have a sword by your side, I have one in my cane; you have no witness, one of these gentlemen will serve you. Now, if you please, remove your bandage.\" The general tore the handkerchief from his eyes. \"At last,\" said he, \"I shall know with whom I have to do.\" They opened the door and the four men alighted.\u0027\" Franz again interrupted himself, and wiped the cold drops from his brow; there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father\u0027s death, which had hitherto been a mystery. Valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer. Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride. Franz continued:-- \"\u0027It was, as we said, the fifth of February. For three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice. The general was stout and tall, the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down. The two witnesses followed. It was a dark night. The ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost, the water of the river looked black and deep. One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal-barge near, and by its light they examined the weapons. The president\u0027s sword, which was simply, as he had said, one he carried in his cane, was five inches shorter than the general\u0027s, and had no guard. The general proposed to cast lots for the swords, but the president said it was he who had given the provocation, and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms. The witnesses endeavored to insist, but the president bade them be silent. The lantern was placed on the ground, the two adversaries took their stations, and the duel began. The light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning; as for the men, they were scarcely perceptible, the darkness was so great. \"\u0027General d\u0027Epinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army, but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell. The witnesses thought he was dead, but his adversary, who knew he had not struck him, offered him the assistance of his hand to rise. The circumstance irritated instead of calming the general, and he rushed on his adversary. But his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken. He received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged, and then returned to the charge. At the third he fell again. They thought he slipped, as at first, and the witnesses, seeing he did not move, approached and endeavored to raise him, but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood. The general, who had almost fainted, revived. \"Ah,\" said he, \"they have sent some fencing-master to fight with me.\" The president, without answering, approached the witness who held the lantern, and raising his sleeve, showed him two wounds he had received in his arm; then opening his coat, and unbuttoning his waistcoat, displayed his side, pierced with a third wound. Still he had not even uttered a sigh. General d\u0027Epinay died five minutes after.\u0027\" Franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible, and then stopped, passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud; but after a moment\u0027s silence, he continued:-- \"\u0027The president went up the steps, after pushing his sword into his cane; a track of blood on the snow marked his course. He had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water--it was the general\u0027s body, which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead. The general fell, then, in a loyal duel, and not in ambush as it might have been reported. In proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts, lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor. \"\u0027Signed, BEAUREPAIRE, DESCHAMPS, and LECHARPAL.\u0027\" When Franz had finished reading this account, so dreadful for a son; when Valentine, pale with emotion, had wiped away a tear; when Villefort, trembling, and crouched in a corner, had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man,--\"Sir,\" said d\u0027Epinay to Noirtier, \"since you are well acquainted with all these details, which are attested by honorable signatures,--since you appear to take some interest in me, although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow, refuse me not one final satisfaction--tell me the name of the president of the club, that I may at least know who killed my father.\" Villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door; Valentine, who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather\u0027s answer, and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm, drew back a few steps. \"Mademoiselle,\" said Franz, turning towards Valentine, \"unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age.\" Valentine remained dumb and motionless. \"Hold, sir,\" said Villefort, \"do not prolong this dreadful scene. The names have been purposely concealed; my father himself does not know who this president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you; proper names are not in the dictionary.\" \"Oh, misery,\" cried Franz: \"the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing, at least, the name of him who killed my father! Sir, sir,\" cried he, turning to Noirtier, \"do what you can--make me understand in some way!\" \"Yes,\" replied Noirtier. \"Oh, mademoiselle,--mademoiselle!\" cried Franz, \"your grandfather says he can indicate the person. Help me,--lend me your assistance!\" Noirtier looked at the dictionary. Franz took it with a nervous trembling, and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively, until he came to M. At that letter the old man signified \"Yes.\" \"M,\" repeated Franz. The young man\u0027s finger, glided over the words, but at each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign. Valentine hid her head between her hands. At length, Franz arrived at the word MYSELF. \"Yes!\" \"You?\" cried Franz, whose hair stood on end; \"you, M. Noirtier--you killed my father?\" 诺瓦蒂埃身穿黑衣服，坐在他的圈椅里准备接见他们。当他期待着的三个人进来以后，他看看门，他的跟班就立刻把门关上。 瓦朗蒂娜掩饰不住内心的喜悦。“记住，”维尔福对她耳语说，“如果诺瓦蒂埃先生想推迟你的婚事，我不许你弄清楚他的意思。” 瓦朗蒂娜红了红脸，但没有说什么。维尔福走近到诺瓦蒂埃跟前。“您要求见见弗兰兹·伊皮奈先生，”他说，“现在他来了。我们都希望他来拜见您一次，我相信在这次拜见以后，您就会理解您反对瓦朗蒂娜的婚事多么没有根据。” 诺瓦蒂埃只用目光作回答，他那种目光使维尔福的血液立时冷却下来。他用他的眼睛向瓦朗蒂娜给了一个示意，要她走过去。幸而她和她的祖父向来是谈得开的，所以没过多久她就明白了他要的东西是一把钥匙。然后他的眼光落到放在两个窗口之间的一只小柜子的抽屉上。她打开那抽屉，找到一把钥匙。她知这就是他所要的东西，她接下又去注意他的眼睛，他的目光转到一张旧写字台上，这只写字台早已为人忽视，以为里面不过藏着一些无用的文件。 “要我打开写字台吗？”瓦朗蒂娜问。 “是的。”老人说。 “开抽屉？” “对。” “边上的那些吗？” “不。” “中间的那个？” “是的。” 瓦朗蒂娜打开抽屉，拿出一卷文件。“您要的是这个吗？” 她问。 “不。” 她把其他所有文件都一样一样拿出来，直到抽屉都拿空了。“抽屉全都空了。”她说。 诺瓦蒂埃的眼光盯到字典上。 “好的，我懂了，爷爷。”那青年女郎说。 她一个一个字母的指着找。指到Ｓ这个字母上，老人就止住她。她翻开字典，一直到“暗隔”这个字。 “啊！抽屉里有暗隔吗？”瓦朗蒂娜说。 “是的。”诺瓦蒂埃表示。 “有谁知道这事？” 诺瓦蒂埃望着仆人出去的那扇门。 “巴罗斯？”她说。 “是的。” “我去把他叫来吗？” “是的。” 瓦朗蒂娜到门口去叫巴罗斯。维尔福看得不耐烦极了，汗珠从他的前额滚下来，弗兰兹呆在一边。那个仆人来了。 “巴罗斯，”瓦朗蒂娜说，“祖父叫我打开写字台的那个抽屉，里面有一层暗隔，你知道怎么打开它，请你弄开好吗？” 巴罗斯望着那个老人。 “听她的。”诺瓦蒂埃聪明的眼光说。 巴罗斯在一暗扭上按动了一下，抽屉的假底脱落了下来，他们见到里面有一卷用黑线缠着的文件。 “您要的是这样东西吗，老爷？”巴罗斯问。 “是的。” “让我把这些文件交给维尔福先生？” “不。” “给瓦朗蒂娜小姐？” “不。” “给弗兰兹·伊皮奈先生？” “是的。” 弗兰兹很是吃惊，他向前了一步。“给我，阁下？”他说。 “是的。” 弗兰兹从巴罗斯的手里把文件接过来，眼光落到包皮纸上，念道：我过世之后，把这包东西交给杜兰特将军，再由杜兰特将军传给他的儿子，嘱其妥善保存，为其中藏有一份最最重要的文件。” “噢，阁下，”弗兰兹问道，“您想让我怎么处理这卷文件呢？” “肯定是要您原封不动地保管起来。”检察官说。 “不！”诺瓦蒂埃急切地说。 “您想让他把它念一遍吗？”瓦朗蒂娜说。 “是的。”老人回答。 “您懂了吗，男爵阁下，家祖父希望您把这卷文件念一遍。”瓦朗蒂娜说。 “那么我们就坐下来吧，”维尔福不耐烦地说，“这可要花一些时间。” “坐。”老人的眼光说。 维尔福在一张椅子上坐下来，但瓦朗蒂娜仍然站在她祖父旁边，弗兰兹站在他前面。“念吧，”老人的眼睛说。弗兰兹撕开封套，在无比深沉的静寂中，念道：“摘自一八一五年二月五日圣·杰克司街拿破仑党俱乐部会议录。” 弗兰兹顿了一顿。“一八一五年二月五日！”他说，“这是家父被害的日子。” 瓦朗蒂娜和维尔福都一时哑口无言，只有老人的目光似乎明明白白地说道：“往下念。” “可是，”他说：“家父是在离开这个俱乐部以后才失踪的。” 诺瓦蒂埃的眼光继续说：“念呀。” 他又继续念道：署名证人炮兵中校路易士·杰克·波尔贝、陆军准将艾蒂安·杜香比及森林水利部长克劳特·李卡波声明：二月四日，接到厄尔巴岛送来的一封函件，向拿破仑党俱乐部推荐弗莱文·奎斯奈尔将军，略谓自一八○四年到一八一四年间，将军始终在圣上麾下服务，路易十八最近虽封他为男爵，并赐以伊皮奈采邑一处，但据说他仍旧对拿破仑皇朝忠心不二。因此有了一张条子送给了奎斯奈尔将军，邀他出席第二天（五日）的会议。条子上没有明写开会地点的街名及门牌号码，也没有署名，只是通知将军，要他在九点钟的时候作好准备开会，有人自会来拜访他。历次的会议都在那个时候开始，一直到午夜。九点钟的时候，俱乐部主席亲自前去拜访，将军已经准备好了。主席告知他，这次邀请他赴会，有一个条件，就是他绝不能知道开会的地点，他的眼睛得蒙起来，保证绝不扯开绑带。奎斯奈尔将军接受了这个条件，并以人格担保绝不想去知道他们所经的路线。将军的马车已经备好，但主席告诉他不能用那辆车子，因为如果车夫可以睁大眼睛认他所经过的街道，那么蒙住主人的眼睛就是多余了。‘那么得怎么办才好呢？’将军问。‘我的马车在这儿，’主席说。‘那么，您却这样信任您的仆人，甚至可以把一个不能让我知道的秘密交托给他吗？’‘我们的车夫是俱乐部的一个会员，’主席说，‘给我们驾车的是一位国务顾问呢。’‘那么我们还有一个危险，’将军大笑着说，‘可能翻车。’我们认为这种玩笑的态度证明将军出席这次会议绝无被迫的嫌疑，而是他自愿前往的。他们坐进马车以后，主席向将军提醒他做的誓言，要把眼睛蒙起来，他并不加以反对。路上，主席看见将军好象有移动那条手帕的念头，就提醒他的誓言。‘没错。’将军说。马车在一条通往圣·杰克司街去的小弄前面停住。将军扶着主席的胳臂下了车，他不清楚主席的身分，还以为他不过是俱乐部的一个会员；他们穿过那条小弄，上了二楼，走进会议厅。讨论已经开始。会员们由于知道那天晚上要介绍一个新会员，所以全体出席。到了屋子中间，他们请将军解开他的手帕，他立刻照办。直到现在，这个社交团体他才知道它的存在，但他却在这个团里见到那么多熟悉的面孔，所以他好象很显得惊讶。他们询问他的政治见解，他只是回答说，那封厄尔巴岛来的信应该已经告知他们了——” 弗兰兹中断他自己朗读，说：“家父是一个保皇党，他们毫无必要询问他的政见，这个大家都知道。” “我敬重令尊也正因为这一点，我亲爱的弗兰兹先生。”维尔福说，“观点相同的人很容易成为朋友。” “念呀。”老人的眼光继续说。 弗兰兹继续念道：“于是主席就让他说得更明确一点，但奎斯奈尔先生回答说，他希望先知道他们要他做些什么事情。于是他们就把厄尔巴岛来的那封信的内容告诉他，那封信将他推荐给俱乐部，认为他也许可以加强他们党的利益。其中有一段讲到波拿巴的返回，并且说另有一封更详细的信托埃及王号带回来，那艘船属于马赛船商莫雷尔，船长对圣上十分忠心。在这期间，这位他们把他当作一个可以信赖的如兄弟一样带来的将军，始终隐约现出厌恶不满的态度。当那封信读完的时候，他依然紧皱着眉头，默默地一言不发。‘唉，’主席问道，‘您对于这封信有什么话要说吗，将军？’‘我说，我在不久以前刚刚宣誓效忠路易十八，现在要我为了废皇来破坏自己的誓言，那未免太唐突了。’这个答复再明显不过了，他的政见已经没有丝毫可怀疑的余地。‘将军’，主席说，‘我们不承认有国王路易十八，也不承认有一位废皇，只承认被暴力和叛逆驱逐出他的法兰西帝国的圣上陛下。’‘原谅我，诸位’，将军说，‘你们或许可以不承认路易十八，但是我却承认，因为他封我做了男爵和元帅，我永远不会忘记我能获得这两项殊荣，归功于他的荣归法国。’‘阁下，’主席用一种严肃不过的口吻说，一边说，一边站起身来，‘您说话得小心点儿，您的话明白无误地告诉我们：在您的事情上，厄尔巴岛上的人是给骗了，而且我们也给骗了。我们对您的这番交往，证明我们很信任您，而且以为您拥有着一种足可以使您留光的政见。现在我们发觉我们错了。一个衔头和一次晋级已使您忠于我们想要推翻的那个政府。我们并不强迫您帮我们什么——我们绝不勉强拉人参加我们中间来，但我们要强迫您作光明正大的行为，即使您本意不情愿那么做。’您所谓光明正大的行为，就是知道了你们的阴谋而不把它泄漏出去，但我认为这样做，就成了你们的同谋犯。您看，我可比您坦诚。’” “啊，我的父亲！”弗兰兹又中断下来说。“我现在明白他们为什么要谋害他了。” 瓦朗蒂娜情不自禁地朝那个青年人瞥了一眼，那个青年的脸上正洋溢着热情的孝思，看上去十分可爱。维尔福在他的背后走过来走过去。诺瓦蒂埃注视着每一个人的表情，仍保持着他那种凛然威严的神气。弗兰兹的目光又回落到原稿上，继续念道：“‘阁下，’主席说，‘您参加这次集会，是我们请来的，不是强迫你来的。我们建议您蒙住眼睛，您接受了。您在答应这两个要求的时候，心里很清楚：我们并不愿意保留路易十八的王位，不然，我们就用不着这样小心以躲避警务部的监视了。您戴着一个假面具来这里发现了我们的秘密，然后又把那个假面具撕下来，要毁掉信任您的那些人，如果我们让您那么去做，那未免太宽大无边了。不行，不行，您必须首先起誓，究竟您是效忠于现在当政的那个短命国王，还是效忠于皇帝陛下。’‘我是一个保皇党，’将军答道，‘我曾宣誓尽忠于路易十八，我决心信守这个誓言。’这几句话引起了全场骚动；有几个会员显然已经开始用什么办法来让将军后悔他自己的鲁莽。主席又站了起来，在恢复了肃静以后，说：‘阁下，您是一个严肃智慧的人，决不会不明白我们眼前这种状况的后果，您的诚实已经告诉我们应该向您提出什么条件。所以，您必须以您的人格发誓，绝不泄漏您所听到的一切。’将军用手握着剑柄，喊道：‘如果你们要讲人格，首先就不要破坏人格的基本条件，不要用暴力来强求任何东西。’‘而您，阁下，’主席很镇定地说，他的镇定比将军的愤怒更加可怕、‘不要用手动您的剑，我忠告您。’将军略感不安地向四周环顾：他并不让步，而汇集了他的全部力量。‘我不发誓。’他说。‘那么您必须死。’主席平静地回答。伊皮奈先生的脸色变得十分苍白。又一次环顾四周；有几个俱乐部的会员在交头接耳，窃窃私议，在大氅底下摸他们的武器。‘将军，’主席说，‘您不用慌。这里的人都是有人格的，我们在采取不得已的极端手段以前，先要尽量说服您；但您说过，这儿的人都是叛徒，您掌握着我们的秘密，您必须把它交给我们。’这几句话之后，是一片意义深长的寂静，因为将军并没有答复。‘把门关上。’主席对守门的人说。这句话跟着的还是死一样的静寂。之后将军往前跨几步，竭力控制他自己的情感。‘我有一个儿子，’他说，在我发觉只身处在一群暗杀者中间的时候，我必须为他考虑。’‘将军，’大会的主人用一种高贵的神情说，‘一个人可以侮辱五十个人，是弱者的特权。但他使用这种特权是不妥当的。听从我的忠告，起誓吧，不要再侮辱。’将军的锐气又给主席的威仪挫败了，他迟疑了一下儿，然后走到主席台前。‘用什么形式？’他说。‘我想这样：“我以我的人格发誓，我于一八一五年二月五日晚上九时至十时间所闻的一切，绝不向任何人泄露，如违此誓，甘愿身死。”’将军神经质地打了一个寒颤，好象大为感动，一时说不出话；然后他克制住那种很明显表露出来的厌恶感，道出那个他所要立的誓言，但他的声音如此之低，简直难以听清。大多数会员都坚持要他清清楚楚地重复一遍，他也照办了。‘现在可以允许我退席了吗？”他说。主席站起身来，指派三个会员陪着他，先是蒙上将军的眼睛，然后和他一起走进马车。那三名会员之中，其中一个就是为他们赶车到那儿去的车夫。‘您要我们送您到什么地方？’主席问。‘随便什么地方都可以，只要不再见到你们就行。伊皮奈先生回答。‘请您放明白点，阁下，’主席答道，“您现在不是在会场里了，现在大家都各人是各人，不要侮辱他们，否则您要后果自负。’但伊皮奈先生不听这些话，继续说：‘你们在你们的马车里还是跟在你们的会场里一样勇敢，因为你们还是四对一。’主席喊住马车。他们这时已到奥米斯码头，那儿有石级通到河边。‘你们为什么在这儿停车？’伊皮奈问。‘因为，阁下，’主席说，‘您侮辱了一个人，而那个人在没有得到体面的补偿以前，不想再往前走一步了。’‘又想进行暗杀吗？’将军耸耸肩说。‘别嚷，阁下，您是希望我把您看作一个懦夫，而用弱者的身分当挡箭牌吗。您只身一人，对付您的也只一个人。您身上有一把剑，我的手杖里也有一把。您没人作证；这几位先生中有一位可以听您吩咐。现在，如果您愿意的话，请摘掉您的蒙眼带吧。’将军把他眼睛上的手帕扯下来。‘我终于可以看清我的对手是谁了。’他说。他们打开车门，四个人都走了出来。” 弗兰兹再一次停下来，擦一把额头上的冷汗；他父亲死时的详细情形直到那时为止仍然还是一个谜，现在让这个做儿子的浑身颤抖、脸色苍白地把它大声念出来，的确产生使人感到一种动人心魄的气氛。瓦朗蒂娜紧攥着她的双手，象是在祈祷。诺瓦蒂埃带着一极其轻视和高傲的神情看着维尔福。弗兰兹继续念道：“前面我们说过，那天是二月五日。三天以来，天气却非常寒冷，石级上结着一层冰。将军身材高大结实，主席把有栏杆的那一边让给他，以便他可以扶栏走下去。两个证人跟在后面。这是一个没有月亮的夜晚。从石级到河边的这一段路面上盖满了雪和霜。其中一个证人到附近的一艘煤船上去借了一盏灯笼，他们在灯光下检验武器。主席的那把剑很简单，就象他所说的，就是套在他手杖里的那一把；他的剑比将军的短五叶，而且没有护手把。将军建议拿两把剑来抽签，但主席说，他是挑战一方，而且在他挑战的时候，本来想每人都用他自己的武器。两个证人却极力要求抽签，但主席命令他们不要多说话。灯笼放到地上，两方敌手站好步位，决斗便告开始。灯光令两把剑看起来象是闪耀电光的，至千人，他们几乎看不清楚，黑暗实在太浓了。伊皮奈将军原被公认为陆军中最好的剑手之一，但他在攻击的时候由于让对方逼得太紧，所以没能刺中他的目标，而跌了一交。证人们以为他死了，但他的对手知道自己的剑没有刺中他，便伸手扶他起来。这种情形非但没有让将军平静下来，反倒激怒了他，他向他的敌手冲过去。但他的对手一剑都不曾虚击。将军三次中剑，三次倒退；他觉得自己给逼得太被动，就再一次采取攻势。击到第三剑时，他又跌倒了。他们以为他又是象一次那样滑倒的。证人们见到他倒下不动，就走过去想扶他起来，但去抱他身体的那一位证人觉得他的手上粘到一种温热潮湿的东西——那是血。将军本来几乎已给昏死过去，这时又苏醒过来。‘啊！’他说，‘他们派了一个剑术大师来和我决斗。’主席并不作声，走近那个提灯笼的证人，撩起他的衣袖，把他手臂上受的两处伤亮给他看；然后解开他的上装，打开背心的纽扣，露出身侧受到的第三处剑伤。可他连哼都没有哼一声。五分钟后，伊皮奈将军死了。” 弗兰兹读到最后这几句的时候，他的声音已经哽咽，他们几乎听不清楚念了些什么，于是他顿了顿，用手在眼睛上抹了一下，好象要驱散掉一片云；静寂一会儿以后，他继续念道：“主席将剑插进他的手杖，转身走下石级；一道血迹顺着他的脚步滴到白雪上。他刚走上石级顶，忽然听到河水里发出一阵沉重的浅水声，那是扔将军的尸体所发出来的声音，证人们验实他确已死亡，就把他抛入河中。所以，将军是在一场高尚的决斗中被杀死而不是被冷箭所暗杀。为证明这一点，我们签署这宗文件，以明真相，深恐将来传闻失实，这幕可怕的场面里的参与者可能会被诬蔑为蓄意谋杀或者别的不名誉的行为。 波尔贝杜香比李卡波” 弗兰兹读完这宗可怕的文件，瓦朗蒂娜感动得脸色发白，擅去了一滴眼泪，维尔福浑身发抖，它缩在一个角落里，以哀求的目光看着那个意志坚强的老人。“阁下，”伊皮奈对诺瓦蒂埃说，“这卷文件上的证人都是很有名望的人士，既然您对于这些情况知道得这么详细，既然您好象很关心我——虽然直到目前为止，您带给我的只有悲痛——请不要拒绝满足我唯一的要求，请告诉我那个俱乐部的主席的名字，我起码也应该知道杀死我可怜父亲的到底是谁。” 维尔福不知所措地去摸门把手，瓦朗蒂娜往后倒退了几步，她比谁都更早地料想到她祖父的答案，因为她常常看见他的右臂上有两块疤痕。 “小姐，”弗兰兹转向瓦朗蒂娜说，“您和我一块儿找出来究竟是谁让我两岁的时候就成了一个孤儿。” 瓦朗蒂娜仍然无言以答，一动也不动。 “拉倒吧，阁下！”维尔福说，“这幕可怕的场面别再没完没了。那个名字是有意隐蔽掉的。家父自己也不知道这个主席究竟何人，即便知道，他也没有告诉您，字典里可没有专用名词。” “噢，我真痛苦呀！”弗兰兹喊道，“我所以还有勇气读到底，就是希望起码可以知道是谁杀死我父亲的！阁下！阁下！” 他朝诺瓦蒂埃喊道，“看在上帝面上，想想办法！想一个办法来让我知道吧！” “是的。”诺瓦蒂埃回答。 “噢，小姐！小姐！”弗兰兹喊道，“您的祖父说他能够说出——那个人。帮帮我！帮帮我的忙！” 诺瓦蒂埃看着那本字典。弗兰兹浑身神经质地颤抖，拿过字典，把字母一个接一个背下去，一直背到Ｍ。背到那个字母，老人示意说：“是的。” “Ｍ，”弗兰兹说。那个青年人的手指一个字一个字地往下移，但诺瓦蒂埃对每一个字作出一个否定的表示。瓦朗蒂娜把她的头埋在自己的双手里。最后，弗兰兹指到“我”那个字。 “是的。”老人示意说。 “你？”弗兰兹喊道，他的头发一下子竖起来，“你，诺瓦蒂埃先生？——是你把我父亲杀死的？” “是的。”诺瓦蒂埃用威严的目光盯住那个青年答道。 弗兰兹瘫软地倒在一张椅子上；维尔福打开门溜之大吉了，因为他的脑子里产生起了一个念头，竟想消灭那老人心里残留的一点生命。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/72/3993.html","bookId":545,"book":{"id":545,"title":"The Count of Monte
