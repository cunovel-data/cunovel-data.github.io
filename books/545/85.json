{"id":43953,"no":85,"title":"Chapter 90 The Meeting","content":"AFTER MERCéDèS had left Monte Cristo, he fell into profound gloom. Around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped; his energetic mind slumbered, as the body does after extreme fatigue. \"What?\" said he to himself, while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out, and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom; \"what? this edifice which I have been so long preparing, which I have reared with so much care and toil, is to be crushed by a single touch, a word, a breath! Yes, this self, of whom I thought so much, of whom I was so proud, who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the Chateau d\u0027If, and whom I had succeeded in making so great, will be but a lump of clay to-morrow. Alas, it is not the death of the body I regret; for is not the destruction of the vital principle, the repose to which everything is tending, to which every unhappy being aspires,--is not this the repose of matter after which I so long sighed, and which I was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when Faria appeared in my dungeon? What is death for me? One step farther into rest,--two, perhaps, into silence. \\n\\n \"No, it is not existence, then, that I regret, but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out, so laboriously framed. Providence is now opposed to them, when I most thought it would be propitious. It is not God\u0027s will that they should be accomplished. This burden, almost as heavy as a world, which I had raised, and I had thought to bear to the end, was too great for my strength, and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career. Oh, shall I then, again become a fatalist, whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence? And all this--all this, because my heart, which I thought dead, was only sleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again, because I have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman\u0027s voice. Yet,\" continued the count, becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow, which Mercédès had accepted, \"yet, it is impossible that so noble-minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in the prime of life and strength; it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love, or rather delirium. There are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration. No, she must have conceived some pathetic scene; she will come and throw herself between us; and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous.\" The blush of pride mounted to the count\u0027s forehead as this thought passed through his mind. \"Ridiculous?\" repeated he; \"and the ridicule will fall on me. I ridiculous? No, I would rather die.\" \\n\\n By thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill-fortune of the next day, to which he had condemned himself by promising Mercédès to spare her son, the count at last exclaimed, \"Folly, folly, folly!--to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at. He will never believe that my death was suicide; and yet it is important for the honor of my memory,--and this surely is not vanity, but a justifiable pride,--it is important the world should know that I have consented, by my free will, to stop my arm, already raised to strike, and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others I have struck myself. It must be; it shall be.\" \\n\\n Seizing a pen, he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk, and wrote at the bottom of the document (which was no other than his will, made since his arrival in Paris) a sort of codicil, clearly explaining the nature of his death. \"I do this, O my God,\" said he, with his eyes raised to heaven, \"as much for thy honor as for mine. I have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance, and other wretches, like Morcerf, Danglars, Villefort, even Morcerf himself, must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy. Let them know, on the contrary, that their punishment, which had been decreed by providence, is only delayed by my present determination, and although they escape it in this world, it awaits them in another, and that they are only exchanging time for eternity.\" \\n\\n While he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties,--wretched waking dreams of grief,--the first rays of morning pierced his windows, and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence. It was just five o\u0027clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear. He turned his head, looked around him, and saw no one; but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality. \\n\\n He arose, and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room, saw Haidée, who had fallen on a chair, with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back. She had been standing at the door, to prevent his going out without seeing her, until sleep, which the young cannot resist, had overpowered her frame, wearied as she was with watching. The noise of the door did not awaken her, and Monte Cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret. \"She remembered that she had a son,\" said he; \"and I forgot I had a daughter.\" Then, shaking his head sorrowfully, \"Poor Haidée,\" said he; \"she wished to see me, to speak to me; she has feared or guessed something. Oh, I cannot go without taking leave of her; I cannot die without confiding her to some one.\" He quietly regained his seat, and wrote under the other lines:-- \\n\\n \"I bequeath to Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis,--and son of my former patron, Pierre Morrel, shipowner at Marseilles,--the sum of twenty millions, a part of which may be offered to his sister Julia and brother-in-law Emmanuel, if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness. These twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at Monte Cristo, of which Bertuccio knows the secret. If his heart is free, and he will marry Haidée, the daughter of Ali Pasha of Yanina, whom I have brought up with the love of a father, and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me, he will thus accomplish my last wish. This will has already constituted Haidée heiress of the rest of my fortune, consisting of lands, funds in England, Austria, and Holland, furniture in my different palaces and houses, and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants, may still amount to sixty millions.\" \\n\\n He was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start, and the pen fell from his hand. \"Haidée,\" said he. \"did you read it?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, my lord,\" said she, \"why are you writing thus at such an hour? Why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me? Are you going to leave me?\" \\n\\n \"I am going on a journey, dear child,\" said Monte Cristo, with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy; \"and if any misfortune should happen to me\" \\n\\n The count stopped. \"Well?\" asked the young girl, with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before, and which startled him. \"Well, if any misfortune happen to me,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"I wish my daughter to be happy.\" Haidée smiled sorrowfully, and shook her head. \"Do you think of dying, my lord?\" said she. \\n\\n \"The wise man, my child, has said, \u0027It is good to think of death.\u0027\" \\n\\n \"Well, if you die,\" said she, \"bequeath your fortune to others, for if you die I shall require nothing;\" and, taking the paper, she tore it in four pieces, and threw it into the middle of the room. Then, the effort having exhausted her strength, she fell not asleep this time, but fainting on the floor. The count leaned over her and raised her in his arms; and seeing that sweet pale face, those lovely eyes closed, that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless, the idea occurred to him for the first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father. \\n\\n \"Alas,\" murmured he, with intense suffering, \"I might, then, have been happy yet.\" Then he carried Haidée to her room, resigned her to the care of her attendants, and returning to his study, which he shut quickly this time, he again copied the destroyed will. As he was finishing, the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard. Monte Cristo approached the window, and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel alight. \"Good,\" said he; \"it was time,\"--and he sealed his will with three seals. A moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing-room, and went to open the door himself. Morrel was there; he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed. \"I am perhaps come too soon, count,\" said he, \"but I frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night, nor has any one in my house. I need to see you strong in your courageous assurance, to recover myself.\" Monte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection; he not only extended his hand to the young man, but flew to him with open arms. \"Morrel,\" said he, \"it is a happy day for me, to feel that I am beloved by such a man as you. Good-morning, Emmanuel; you will come with me then, Maximilian?\" \\n\\n \"Did you doubt it?\" said the young captain. \\n\\n \"But if I were wrong\"-- \\n\\n \"I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday; I have been thinking of your firmness all night, and I said to myself that justice must be on your side, or man\u0027s countenance is no longer to be relied on.\" \\n\\n \"But, Morrel, Albert is your friend?\" \\n\\n \"Simply an acquaintance, sir.\" \\n\\n \"You met on the same day you first saw me?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, that is true; but I should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me.\" \\n\\n \"Thank you, Morrel.\" Then ringing the bell once, \"Look.\" said he to Ali, who came immediately, \"take that to my solicitor. It is my will, Morrel. When I am dead, you will go and examine it.\" \\n\\n \"What?\" said Morrel, \"you dead?\" \\n\\n \"Yes; must I not be prepared for everything, dear friend? But what did you do yesterday after you left me?\" \\n\\n \"I went to Tortoni\u0027s, where, as I expected, I found Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud. I own I was seeking them.\" \\n\\n \"Why, when all was arranged?\" \\n\\n \"Listen, count; the affair is serious and unavoidable.\" \\n\\n \"Did you doubt it!\" \\n\\n \"No; the offence was public, and every one is already talking of it.\" \\n\\n \"Well?\" \\n\\n \"Well, I hoped to get an exchange of arms,--to substitute the sword for the pistol; the pistol is blind.\" \\n\\n \"Have you succeeded?\" asked Monte Cristo quickly, with an imperceptible gleam of hope. \\n\\n \"No; for your skill with the sword is so well known.\" \\n\\n \"Ah?--who has betrayed me?\" \\n\\n \"The skilful swordsman whom you have conquered.\" \\n\\n \"And you failed?\" \\n\\n \"They positively refused.\" \\n\\n \"Morrel,\" said the count, \"have you ever seen me fire a pistol?\" \\n\\n \"Never.\" \\n\\n \"Well, we have time; look.\" Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when Mercédès entered, and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate, with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club. At each shot Morrel turned pale. He examined the bullets with which Monte Cristo performed this dexterous feat, and saw that they were no larger than buckshot. \"It is astonishing,\" said he. \"Look, Emmanuel.\" Then turning towards Monte Cristo, \"Count,\" said he, \"in the name of all that is dear to you, I entreat you not to kill Albert!--the unhappy youth has a mother.\" \\n\\n \"You are right,\" said Monte Cristo; \"and I have none.\" These words were uttered in a tone which made Morrel shudder. \"You are the offended party, count.\" \\n\\n \"Doubtless; what does that imply?\" \\n\\n \"That you will fire first.\" \\n\\n \"I fire first?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, I obtained, or rather claimed that; we had conceded enough for them to yield us that.\" \\n\\n \"And at what distance?\" \\n\\n \"Twenty paces.\" A smile of terrible import passed over the count\u0027s lips. \"Morrel,\" said he, \"do not forget what you have just seen.\" \\n\\n \"The only chance for Albert\u0027s safety, then, will arise from your emotion.\" \\n\\n \"I suffer from emotion?\" said Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"Or from your generosity, my friend; to so good a marksman as you are, I may say what would appear absurd to another.\" \\n\\n \"What is that?\" \\n\\n \"Break his arm--wound him--but do not kill him.\" \\n\\n \"I will tell you, Morrel,\" said the count, \"that I do not need entreating to spare the life of M. de Morcerf; he shall be so well spared, that he will return quietly with his two friends, while I\"-- \\n\\n \"And you?\" \\n\\n \"That will be another thing; I shall be brought home.\" \\n\\n \"No, no,\" cried Maximilian, quite unable to restrain his feelings. \\n\\n \"As I told you, my dear Morrel, M. de Morcerf will kill me.\" Morrel looked at him in utter amazement. \"But what has happened, then, since last evening, count?\" \\n\\n \"The same thing that happened to Brutus the night before the battle of Philippi; I have seen a ghost.\" \\n\\n \"And that ghost\"-- \\n\\n \"Told me, Morrel, that I had lived long enough.\" Maximilian and Emmanuel looked at each other. Monte Cristo drew out his watch. \"Let us go,\" said he; \"it is five minutes past seven, and the appointment was for eight o\u0027clock.\" A carriage was in readiness at the door. Monte Cristo stepped into it with his two friends. He had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door, and Maximilian and Emmanuel, who had considerately passed forward a few steps, thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within. As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting. \"We are first,\" said Morrel, looking out of the window. \"Excuse me, sir,\" said Baptistin, who had followed his master with indescribable terror, \"but I think I see a carriage down there under the trees.\" \\n\\n Monte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage, and offered his hand to assist Emmanuel and Maximilian. The latter retained the count\u0027s hand between his. \"I like,\" said he, \"to feel a hand like this, when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause.\" \\n\\n \"It seems to me,\" said Emmanuel, \"that I see two young men down there, who are evidently, waiting.\" Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two behind his brother-in-law. \"Maximilian,\" said he, \"are your affections disengaged?\" Morrel looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment. \"I do not seek your confidence, my dear friend. I only ask you a simple question; answer it;--that is all I require.\" \\n\\n \"I love a young girl, count.\" \\n\\n \"Do you love her much?\" \\n\\n \"More than my life.\" \\n\\n \"Another hope defeated!\" said the count. Then, with a sigh, \"Poor Haidée!\" murmured he. \\n\\n \"To tell the truth, count, if I knew less of you, I should think that you were less brave than you are.\" \\n\\n \"Because I sigh when thinking of some one I am leaving? Come, Morrel, it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage. Do I regret life? What is it to me, who have passed twenty years between life and death? Moreover, do not alarm yourself, Morrel; this weakness, if it is such, is betrayed to you alone. I know the world is a drawing-room, from which we must retire politely and honestly; that is, with a bow, and our debts of honor paid.\" \\n\\n \"That is to the purpose. Have you brought your arms?\" \\n\\n \"I?--what for? I hope these gentlemen have theirs.\" \\n\\n \"I will inquire,\" said Morrel. \\n\\n \"Do; but make no treaty--you understand me?\" \\n\\n \"You need not fear.\" Morrel advanced towards Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud, who, seeing his intention, came to meet him. The three young men bowed to each other courteously, if not affably. \\n\\n \"Excuse me, gentlemen,\" said Morrel, \"but I do not see M. de Morcerf.\" \\n\\n \"He sent us word this morning,\" replied Chateau-Renaud, \"that he would meet us on the ground.\" \\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Morrel. Beauchamp pulled out his watch. \"It is only five minutes past eight,\" said he to Morrel; \"there is not much time lost yet.\" \\n\\n \"Oh, I made no allusion of that kind,\" replied Morrel. \\n\\n \"There is a carriage coming,\" said Chateau-Renaud. It advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled. \"You are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen? M. de Monte Cristo yields his right of using his.\" \\n\\n \"We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count,\" said Beauchamp, \"and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten days since, thinking to want them on a similar occasion. They are quite new, and have not yet been used. Will you examine them.\" \\n\\n \"Oh, M. Beauchamp, if you assure me that M. de Morcerf does not know these pistols, you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient.\" \\n\\n \"Gentlemen,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"it is not Morcerf coming in that carriage;--faith, it is Franz and Debray!\" The two young men he announced were indeed approaching. \"What chance brings you here, gentlemen?\" said Chateau-Renaud, shaking hands with each of them. \"Because,\" said Debray, \"Albert sent this morning to request us to come.\" Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud exchanged looks of astonishment. \"I think I understand his reason,\" said Morrel. \\n\\n \"What is it?\" \\n\\n \"Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from M. de Morcerf, begging me to attend the opera.\" \\n\\n \"And I,\" said Debray. \\n\\n \"And I also,\" said Franz. \\n\\n \"And we, too,\" added Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud. \\n\\n \"Having wished you all to witness the challenge, he now wishes you to be present at the combat.\" \\n\\n \"Exactly so,\" said the young men; \"you have probably guessed right.\" \\n\\n \"But, after all these arrangements, he does not come himself,\" said Chateau-Renaud. \"Albert is ten minutes after time.\" \\n\\n \"There he comes,\" said Beauchamp, \"on horseback, at full gallop, followed by a servant.\" \\n\\n \"How imprudent,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols, after all the instructions I had given him.\" \"And besides,\" said Beauchamp, \"with a collar above his cravat, an open coat and white waistcoat! Why has he not painted a spot upon his heart?--it would have been more simple.\" Meanwhile Albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men. He jumped from his horse, threw the bridle on his servant\u0027s arms, and joined them. He was pale, and his eyes were red and swollen; it was evident that he had not slept. A shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance, which was not natural to him. \"I thank you, gentlemen,\" said he, \"for having complied with my request; I feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship.\" Morrel had stepped back as Morcerf approached, and remained at a short distance. \"And to you also, M. Morrel, my thanks are due. Come, there cannot be too many.\" \\n\\n \"Sir,\" said Maximilian, \"you are not perhaps aware that I am M. de Monte Cristo\u0027s friend?\" \\n\\n \"I was not sure, but I thought it might be so. So much the better; the more honorable men there are here the better I shall be satisfied.\" \\n\\n \"M. Morrel,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"will you apprise the Count of Monte Cristo that M. de Morcerf is arrived, and we are at his disposal?\" Morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission. Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage. \"Stop, gentlemen,\" said Albert; \"I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Cristo.\" \\n\\n \"In private?\" asked Morrel. \\n\\n \"No, sir; before all who are here.\" \\n\\n Albert\u0027s witnesses looked at each other. Franz and Debray exchanged some words in a whisper, and Morrel, rejoiced at this unexpected incident, went to fetch the count, who was walking in a retired path with Emmanuel. \"What does he want with me?\" said Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"I do not know, but he wishes to speak to you.\" \\n\\n \"Ah?\" said Monte Cristo, \"I trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult!\" \\n\\n \"I do not think that such is his intention,\" said Morrel. \\n\\n The count advanced, accompanied by Maximilian and Emmanuel. His calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to Albert\u0027s grief-stricken face, who approached also, followed by the other four young men. When at three paces distant from each other, Albert and the count stopped. \\n\\n \"Approach, gentlemen,\" said Albert; \"I wish you not to lose one word of what I am about to have the honor of saying to the Count of Monte Cristo, for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it, strange as it may appear to you.\" \\n\\n \"Proceed, sir,\" said the count. \\n\\n \"Sir,\" said Albert, at first with a tremulous voice, but which gradually because firmer, \"I reproached you with exposing the conduct of M. de Morcerf in Epirus, for guilty as I knew he was, I thought you had no right to punish him; but I have since learned that you had that right. It is not Fernand Mondego\u0027s treachery towards Ali Pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you, but the treachery of the fisherman Fernand towards you, and the almost unheard-of miseries which were its consequences; and I say, and proclaim it publicly, that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father, and I, his son, thank you for not using greater severity.\" \\n\\n Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene, it would not have surprised them more than did Albert\u0027s declaration. As for Monte Cristo, his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. He could not understand how Albert\u0027s fiery nature, of which he had seen so much among the Roman bandits, had suddenly stooped to this humiliation. He recognized the influence of Mercédès, and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless. \"Now, sir,\" said Albert, \"if you think my apology sufficient, pray give me your hand. Next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess, I rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault. But this confession concerns me only. I acted well as a man, but you have acted better than man. An angel alone could have saved one of us from death--that angel came from heaven, if not to make us friends (which, alas, fatality renders impossible), at least to make us esteem each other.\" \\n\\n Monte Cristo, with moistened eye, heaving breast, and lips half open, extended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear. \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"M. de Monte Cristo receives my apology. I had acted hastily towards him. Hasty actions are generally bad ones. Now my fault is repaired. I hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated. But if any one should entertain a false opinion of me,\" added he, drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies, \"I shall endeavor to correct his mistake.\" \\n\\n \"What happened during the night?\" asked Beauchamp of Chateau-Renaud; \"we appear to make a very sorry figure here.\" \\n\\n \"In truth, what Albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble,\" replied the baron. \\n\\n \"What can it mean?\" said Debray to Franz. \"The Count of Monte Cristo acts dishonorably to M. de Morcerf, and is justified by his son! Had I ten Yaninas in my family, I should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times.\" As for Monte Cristo, his head was bent down, his arms were powerless. Bowing under the weight of twenty-four years\u0027 reminiscences, he thought not of Albert, of Beauchamp, of Chateau-Renaud, or of any of that group; but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son\u0027s life, to whom he had offered his, and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret, capable of destroying forever in that young man\u0027s heart every feeling of filial piety. \\n\\n 美塞苔丝离开基督山先生以后，一种凄凉的阴影笼罩了一切。在他的身体和在他的内心，一切的思想全都停滞了，他那强有力的头脑和他的身体都已在极端的疲倦以后隐入了微睡状态。“什么！”当灯油和蜡烛都将燃烧的时候，仆人们在外厅里等得不耐烦了，他对他自己说，——“什么！这座我准备了这么久，那小心和辛苦地建立起来的大厦，竟这样被手指一点，说一句话，一口气，就毁于一旦吗？呃，什么！这个身躯，这个我曾为它费了那么多心机，这样引以自豪，在伊夫堡的黑牢里一文不值而现在我已经把它造成这样伟大的身躯，明天就要变成一堆泥土了吗？唉！我所惋惜的不是肉体的死亡。生命的毁灭使一切都可得到安息，这不正是每一个不幸的人所祈求的吗？肉体的安息不是我所长久盼望的，当法利亚在我的黑牢里出现的时候，我不是也想用痛苦的绝食方法来达到那种目的吗？死只是向安息跨进一步，那对我有什么意义呢？不，生命的终结并不可怕，而是我这样辛辛苦苦长年累月设计出来的计划就这样毁了。我原以为上帝是赞成这些计划的，现在看来实际上他是反对的了！上帝不同意这些计划完成。这个负担，这个几乎象一个世界一样沉重的负担，我曾肩负了，并且以为能负到终点，但实际上它是太沉重了，使我不得不在半路上把它放了下来。噢！十四年的绝望和十年的希望把我造成了一个上帝的信徒，难道我现在又要再成为听凭命运摆布的人？而这一切——这一切都只因为那颗我自以为已经死掉的心其实只是麻木而已，因为它已醒过来又开始跳动，因为一个女人的声音在我的胸膛里跳动所激起的痛苦使我屈从了！可是，”伯爵继续说，他对于美塞苔丝所接受的明天他将为她而忍受那场残酷决斗的恶运感到苦恼，——“可是，一个心地如此高贵的女人，是不可能这样自私地在我身强力壮的时候就让我这样死的呀，母爱，或有母性的疯狂决不会使她走到这一地步！有些美德在过分夸大以后便变成了罪恶。不，她一定已经想好了某种动人的场面，她会插身到我们中间来阻止我们的决斗，而在这时看来是非常崇高的举动，决斗场上便会变得荒诞可笑。”想这一切时，自尊的红晕浮上了伯爵的脸。“荒诞可笑，”他又说，“而那种耻笑将落到我的身上。我将被人耻笑！不，我还是死了的好！” \\n\\n 伯爵以为他在答应美塞苔丝饶恕她儿子的时候已经判了自己的死刑，而这种厄运被他自己夸大地那么可怕！这样的自怨自艾终于使伯爵大声喊叫起来：“蠢！蠢！蠢！竟慷慨到把自己的身体作为那个青年打靶的目标。他决不会相信我的死只是一种自杀；可是，为了我的荣誉，这当然不是虚荣，而是一种正当的自尊心，我必须让全世界知道，我是自愿放弃了那只已经高举起来准备反击的手，用那只本来准备反击旁人的强有力的手来打击我自己。这是必须的，这是应该的！” \\n\\n 他抓起一支笔，从书桌的一只秘密抽屉里抽出一张纸来，现在他又附加了很多东西，清清楚楚地解释他死的原因。“噢，我的上帝！”他抬头向天说，“我这样做，是为了我的光荣，也为了您的光荣。十年来，我一向把自己看作复仇的天使。而寻些坏蛋，象马尔塞夫、腾格拉尔、维尔福这种人，不要让他们以为他们的敌人已没有复仇的机会。相反，要让他们知道，他们受罚是上帝的意思，我现在的决定只是延期执行而已。他们虽然在这个世界里逃避了惩罚，但惩罚正在另一个世界里等待他们，这只是时间早晚的问题！” \\n\\n 当他正在被这些伤心可怕的幻景煎熬的时候，晨曦染白了窗上的玻璃，照亮了他手下的那张淡蓝色的纸。突然，一种轻微的声音传到他耳朵里，听来象是一声窒息的叹息声。他转过头来，向四周环视，看不见人。但那种声音又清晰地传来，使他确信这不是自己的幻觉。他站起身来，静悄悄地打开客厅的门，看见海黛坐在一把椅子上，两手垂下，她那美丽的头无力地向后仰着。她本来是站在门口，准备在伯爵出来的时候见他一面，但因为守等了这么长时间，也那虚弱的身体再也支持不住了，就倒在椅子上睡着了，开门的响声并没有把她惊醒，基督山带着一种充满爱怜的目光凝视她。“她记得她有一个儿子，”他说，“而我却忘记了我有一个女儿。” \\n\\n 于是，他伤心地摇摇头，“可怜的海黛！”他说，”她想见我，想和我说话，她提心某种事情要发生，已经猜到了明天某种事情要发生。噢！我不能就这样和她告别，我不能不把她托给一个人就这样死掉。”他又回到他的座位上，接下去写道： \\n\\n “我把两千万遗赠给我的旧东家马赛船商比埃尔·莫雷尔的儿子驻阿尔及利亚骑兵队长马西米兰·莫雷尔，他可以将其中的一部分转赠给他的妹妹尤莉和妹夫艾曼纽，如果他不认为这种财产的增加会减少他们的快乐的话。这两千万财产藏在我基督山的岩窟里，伯都西奥知道那个岩窟的秘密。如果他还没有心上人的话，他可以和亚尼纳总督阿里的女儿海黛结婚，这样，他就实现了我最后的希望了。海黛是我用一个父亲的爱来抚养她的，而她也象一个女儿一样的爱我。这份遗书已写明海黛继承我其余的财产，——包括我在英国、奥地利与荷兰的土地和资金，以及我各处大夏别墅里的家具；这笔财产，除了那两千万和赠给我仆人的遗产以外，依旧还值六千万。” \\n\\n 正当他写完最后一行的时候，他身后的一声尖叫把他吓了一跳，笔吓得松手掉了下去。“海黛，”他说，“你都看到了吗？” \\n\\n 原来海黛早已被照到脸上的曙光唤醒，起身走到伯爵身后，但伯爵并没有听到地毯上那轻微的脚步声。“噢，我的大人，”她说，“你为什么要在这个时候写这种东西呢？你为什么要把你的财产全部遗赠给我呢？难道你要离开我了吗？” \\n\\n “我要去旅行一次，好孩子，”基督山带着一种忧郁、充满无限温情地神色说，“如果我遭到任何的不幸——”伯爵停下来。 \\n\\n “什么？”那青年女郎用一种庄严的语气问，伯爵以前从未见过她用这种口气，这使他吃了一惊。 \\n\\n “嗯，假如我遇到了任何的不幸，”基督山答道，“我希望我的女儿幸福。” \\n\\n 海黛苦笑了一下，摇摇头。“你想到死了吗，大人？”她说。 \\n\\n “那么，如果你死了，”她说，“把你的财产遗赠给别人吧。” \\n\\n 他把这份遗嘱撕成四片，抛到房子中央。然后，接着精疲力尽了，跌倒在地板上，但这一次不是睡了过去，而是昏了过去。伯爵俯下身去，把她抱起来；望着那个纯净而苍白的面孔，那一双可爱的闭拢的眼睛，那个窈窕的、一动不动的、外表上似乎毫无生气的身体，他忽然有了一个念头；或许她对他的爱并不是一个女儿对一个父亲的爱。 \\n\\n “唉！”他万分沮丧地喃喃地说，“那末，我本来也许可以得到的。”于是他把海黛抱到她的房间里，吩咐她的待女照顾她，再回到他的书房里；这一次他立刻把门关上，然后把那撕毁的遗嘱重新抄写一遍。当他快要抄完的时候，他听到前院里驶进一辆马车。基督山走到窗口，看见马西米兰和艾曼纽走下车来。“好！”他说，“时间到了。”于是他用三颗火漆封住他的遗嘱。过了一会儿了，他听到客厅里有声音了，就走过去亲自打开门。 \\n\\n 莫雷尔已等在客厅里了，他比约定的时间早来了二十分钟。“我或许来得太早了，伯爵，”他说，“但我坦率地承认，我整夜未眠，我家里的人也都和我一样。我要看到您精力充沛，才能放下心。” \\n\\n 基督山无法不被感动；但他并不伸手给那青年，却是去拥抱他。“莫雷尔，”他说，“今天是一个快乐的日子，能得到象你这样一个人真挚的爱。早安，艾曼纽，那末你们和我一起去吗，马西米兰？” \\n\\n “你还怀疑吗？”那青年队长说。 \\n\\n “但假如是我错了呢？” \\n\\n “在昨天那场挑衅中，我始终注视着你，昨天晚上我整夜地回想你那种坚定的表情，于是我对自己说，正义一定是在你这边的，不然，你是不会那样镇静。” \\n\\n “但是，莫雷尔，阿尔贝不是你的朋友吗？” \\n\\n “我们只是相识而已，伯爵。” \\n\\n “你不是初次见到我的那一天见到他的吗？” \\n\\n “是的，不错，要不是你提醒我，我已记不得了。” \\n\\n “谢谢你，莫雷尔。”然后按了一下门铃，“喂，”他对进来的阿里说，“把这个拿去送给我的律师。这是我的遗嘱，莫雷尔。我死了以后，打开看。” \\n\\n “什么！”莫雷尔说，“你死？” \\n\\n “是的，我不是应该先准备好吗？亲爱的朋友？你昨天离开我以后又去做些什么呢？” \\n\\n “我到托多尼俱乐部去，那儿，正如我所预料那样，我找到了波尚和夏多·勒诺。我向你坦白承认我是去找他们的。” \\n\\n “为什么，不是一切都安排好了吗？” \\n\\n “听我说，伯爵，这件事很严重，而且无法避免的。” \\n\\n “你还怀疑什么呢？” \\n\\n “不，那次挑战是在大庭广众这下进行的，现在每一个人都已经在谈论这件事了。” \\n\\n “怎么样？” \\n\\n “嗯，我希望换一种武器，用长剑代替手枪，手枪是不长眼睛的。” \\n\\n “他们同意了吗？”基督山急切地问，他的心里怀着一种令人无法觉察的希望之光。 \\n\\n “没有，因为你的剑术是太好了。” \\n\\n “啊！是谁出卖了我？” \\n\\n “那个被你击败的剑术教师。” \\n\\n “而你失败了。” \\n\\n “他们断然拒绝。” \\n\\n “莫雷尔，”伯爵说，“从来没有见过我打枪吧？” \\n\\n “从来没有。” \\n\\n “嗯，我们还有时间，瞧。”基督山拿起那支美塞苔丝进来时握在手里的手枪，把每一张梅花爱司钉在靶板上，他接连开了四枪打掉了梅花的四边。 \\n\\n 每射一枪，莫雷尔的脸就苍白一次。他察看基督山用来造成这种神妙奇术的弹丸比绿豆还小。“真是太令人吃惊了” \\n\\n 他说，“看，艾曼纽。”然后，他转过去对基督山说，“伯爵，看在上帝的面上，我求你不要杀死阿尔贝！他有一个可怜母亲。” \\n\\n “你说得对，”基督山说，“而我却没有。”说这句话的口气使莫雷尔打了一个寒颤。 \\n\\n “你是受挑衅的一方，伯爵。” \\n\\n “当然，这是什么意思呢？” \\n\\n “就是你将先开枪。” \\n\\n “我先开枪？” \\n\\n “噢！这是我极力要求得来的：我们对他们的让步已经够多了，他们应该在那一点上对我们让步了。” \\n\\n “相隔几步？” \\n\\n “二十步。” \\n\\n 一个可怕的微笑掠过伯爵的嘴唇。“莫雷尔，”他说，“不要忘记你刚才所看到的一切。” \\n\\n “看来，阿尔贝唯一能逃命的机会，就只有在你临时情绪激动的情况下了。” \\n\\n “我会激动？”基督山说。 \\n\\n “或许是出于你的宽容，我的朋友，你是非常杰出的一位射手，我或许想说一句对旁人说就显得荒谬可笑的话。” \\n\\n “什么话？” \\n\\n “打断他的手臂，打伤他，但不要打死他。” \\n\\n “我可以告诉你，莫雷尔，”伯爵说，“你不必向我恳求饶恕马尔塞夫先生的生命，他一定可以保全生命，可以平安地和他的两位朋友回去，而我——” \\n\\n “而你？” \\n\\n “那就是另外一回事了，我将被扛回家来。” \\n\\n “不，不。”马西米兰情不自禁地喊起来。” \\n\\n “就象我对您说的，亲爱的莫雷尔，马尔塞夫先生会杀死我的。” \\n\\n 莫雷尔迷惑不解地望着伯爵。“昨天晚上发生了什么事，伯爵？” \\n\\n “象布鲁特斯在菲利普之战的前夜一样，我看见了一个鬼。” \\n\\n “而那个鬼——” \\n\\n “他告诉我，莫雷尔，说我已经活得太长久了。” \\n\\n 马西米兰和艾曼纽面面相觑。基督山拿出他的表来看了一下。“我们去吧，”他说，“七点五分了，我们约定的时间是八点钟。” \\n\\n 一马车已等在门口。基督山和他的两个朋友跨进车厢。他在经过走廊时停了一下，听了一下门内的声音；马西米兰和艾曼纽已经向前走了几步，他们好象听到了他的叹息声，象是从内心深处发出来的一种无声哭泣。 \\n\\n 八点正，他们驶到约会的地点。“我们到了，”莫雷尔从车窗里探出头来，“而且是我们先到。” \\n\\n “请主人原谅，”跟着他主人同来的巴浦斯汀带着难以形容的恐怖神色说，“我好象看见那边树林底下有一辆马车。” \\n\\n “可不是，”艾曼纽说，“我也看到好象也有两个青年人，他们显然是在等人。” \\n\\n 基督山轻快地跳下车子，伸手扶下艾曼纽和马西米兰。马西米兰把伯爵的手握在自己的双手之间。“啊，太好了，”他说，“我很高兴看到一个面临生死决斗的人，他的手依旧还是这样的坚定。” \\n\\n 基督山拉了莫雷尔一下，不是把他拉到旁边，而是把他拉到他妹夫后边一两步的地方。“马西米兰，”他说，“你有心上人了吗？”莫雷尔惊奇地望着基督山。“我并不是要打听你的私事，我亲爱的朋友。我只是问你一个简单的问题，回答吧，——我只有这么一个请求。” \\n\\n “我爱着一位年轻姑娘，伯爵。” \\n\\n “你很爱她吗？” \\n\\n “甚于爱我的生命。” \\n\\n “又一个希望成了泡影！”伯爵说。然后，叹了一口气，“可怜的海黛！”他轻声地说道。 \\n\\n “老实说，伯爵，假如我不是这样熟悉你，真会以为您没有那么勇敢呢？” \\n\\n “我叹息是因为我想到我要离开一个人。来，莫雷尔，难道一个军人不懂得什么是真正的勇敢吗？生命吗？我曾在生与死之间生活了二十年，生死对我有什么关系？所以，不要惊慌，莫雷尔，假如这是一种软弱的话，这种软弱也只是向你一个人泄露了。我知道世界是一个客厅，我们必须客客气气地退出，——那是说，鞠躬退出，这样才算体面。” \\n\\n “本来就是如此。你可把你的武器带来了吗？” \\n\\n “我？何必呢？我希望那几位先生把武器带来。” \\n\\n “我去问一下。”莫雷尔说。 \\n\\n “去问吧，但不要去请求什么，你明白我的意思吗？” \\n\\n “你不用担心。” \\n\\n 莫雷尔朝波尚和夏多·勒诺走过去，他们看见莫雷尔走来，便上前迎了过去。三位青年客客气气地（即使不是殷勤地）鞠了一躬。 \\n\\n “原谅我，二位，”莫雷尔说，“我怎么没有看见马尔塞夫先生。” \\n\\n “他今天早晨派人来告诉我们，”夏多·勒诺答道，“说到这儿来和我们相会。” \\n\\n “啊！”莫雷尔说。 \\n\\n 波尚掏出他的表。“才八点过五分，”他对莫雷尔说，“还不算太晚。” \\n\\n “哦！我不是这个意思。”莫雷尔回答。 \\n\\n “啊，”夏多·勒诺插话说，“有一辆马车驶过来啦。” \\n\\n 这时，一辆马车正从大路上向他们所在的这块空地上疾驰而来。 \\n\\n “二位，”莫雷尔说，“你们一定带着手枪罗。基督山先生已经放弃了使用他的武器的权利。” \\n\\n “我们预料到伯爵一定会这样客气，”波尚说，“我带来了几支手枪，这都是我八九天以前买的，本来也以为要用它们来做同样的事。它们还是新的，还没有用过。要不要试一试？” \\n\\n “哦，波尚先生，”莫雷尔鞠了一躬说，“既然你已经向我保证马尔塞夫先生没有碰过这些武器，我相信你说话是算数的。” \\n\\n “二位，”夏多·勒诺说，在“那辆马车里的不是马尔塞夫，——我敢保证，那是弗兰兹和德布雷！”他们所指出的那两个青年正朝这边走过来。“是什么风把你们吹到这儿来的，二位？”夏多·勒诺一面说，一面与他们逐一握手。 \\n\\n “因为，”德布雷说，“阿尔贝今天早晨派人请我们来的。” \\n\\n 波尚和夏多·勒诺诧异地对望了一下。 \\n\\n “我想我懂得他的意思。”莫雷尔说。 \\n\\n “什么意思？” \\n\\n “昨天下午我接到马尔塞夫先生的一封信，请我到歌剧院去。” \\n\\n “我也收到。”德布雷说。 \\n\\n “我也收到过。”弗兰士说。 \\n\\n “我们也收到过。”波尚和夏多·勒诺也说。 \\n\\n “但是希望你们目睹那场挑衅以后，现在又希望你们来观看这场。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “一点不错，”那几个青年说，“一定是这么回事。” \\n\\n “但怎么回事，他自己怎么还没有来，”夏多·勒诺说，” \\n\\n 阿尔贝已经晚了十分钟了。” \\n\\n “喏，他来啦，”波尚说，“那个骑马疾驰而来的就是，后面跟着一个仆人。” \\n\\n “多粗心！”夏尔·勒诺说，“我那样叮嘱关照他以后，竟还骑着马来决斗。” \\n\\n “而且，”波尚说，“戴着大领圈，穿上一件敞胸上装和白背心。他为什么不干脆在胸上做一个记号呢？——那不是更简单啦。” \\n\\n 这时，阿尔贝已经驶到距离那五个青年十步以内的地方。 \\n\\n 他跳下马来，把缰绳扔给他的仆人，向他们走来。他脸色苍白，眼睛红肿，显然他一夜没有睡过觉。在他的脸上布满一种忧郁庄重的阴影，这种哀情在他脸上是不多见的。“诸位，” \\n\\n 他说，“谢谢你们接受了我的要求，我也非常感激你们给予我们这种友谊。”当马尔塞夫走近时候，莫雷尔已往后退去，但仍站在不远的地方。“还有您，莫雷尔先生，我也感谢您。来吧，朋友是不嫌多的。” \\n\\n “阁下，”马西米兰说，“您或许不明白，我是基督山先生的证人吧？” \\n\\n “我冒然不敢确定，但也已经猜想到了。那就更好，这里可尊敬的人愈多，我就愈满意。” \\n\\n “莫雷尔先生，”夏多·勒诺说，“请你去通知基督山伯爵先生好吗？说马尔塞夫先生已经到了，我们在等候他的吩咐。” \\n\\n 莫雷尔走出去去告诉伯爵先生。同时，波尚从马车里取出装手枪的盒来。 \\n\\n “等一下，诸位！”阿尔贝说，“我有两句话要对基督山伯爵说。” \\n\\n “私下里说吗？”莫雷尔问。 \\n\\n “不，阁下，当着大家的面说。” \\n\\n 阿尔贝的证人们都惊奇地面面相觑；弗兰兹和德布雷低声低声交谈了几句话；莫雷尔很喜欢这个意料之外的小插曲，便走去找伯爵，伯爵正和艾曼纽在一条僻静的小路上散步。 \\n\\n “他找我去做什么？”基督山说。 \\n\\n “噢！”基督山说，“我相信他不会再有新的花样去激怒上帝吧！” \\n\\n “我看他没有这种意思。”莫雷尔说。 \\n\\n 伯爵由马西米兰和艾曼纽陪着走了过去；他那平静而充满从容的脸与阿尔贝那张愁容满面的脸构成一个鲜明的对照；阿尔贝这时也已走了过来，后面跟着那四个青年。 \\n\\n 当他们相距三步远的时候，阿尔贝和伯爵都停下来。 \\n\\n “来吧，诸位，”阿尔贝说，“我希望你们不要漏听我现在有幸向基督山伯爵所说的每一句话，。因为这番话或许你们听来会感到很奇怪，但只要有人愿意，你们必须讲给他们听。” \\n\\n “请说，阁下。”伯爵说。 \\n\\n “阁下。”阿尔贝说，他的声音最初有些颤抖，但很快就要安定下来，“我以前责备你不应该揭现马尔塞夫先生在伊皮奈的行为，因为在我认为，不论他有什么罪，你是没有任何权利去惩罚他的，但后来我才知道你有那种权利。使我这样认为的，不是弗尔南多·蒙台哥出卖阿里总督这件事，而是渔夫弗尔南多出卖您，这件事以及那次出卖所引起的那种种加在你身上的痛苦。所以我说，而且我公开宣布，您有权利向我父复仇，而我，他的儿子，现在感谢您没有用更狠毒的手段。” \\n\\n 即使打一个霹雳，也不会有人想到出现这种场面，也没有比阿尔贝的宣布更使他们惊诧的事了。至于基督山，他的眼眼慢慢地望着天空，脸上露出无限感激的表情。他在罗马强盗中间已听说过阿尔贝那暴烈的脾气，所以很惊奇他会突然这样忍辱负重。他在其中看到了美塞苔丝的影响，这时，他这才明白昨天晚上她那高贵的心为什么没有反对他的牺牲，因为她早料到那是决不会发生的。 \\n\\n “现在，阁下，”阿尔贝说，“假使您以为我的歉意已经够了，就请您把手伸给我。我认为一个人象您这样没有过错，但一旦有了过错能坦白承认，或许这种美德只可以用我一个人身上。我只是一个好人，而您却比任何人都好。只有一个天使能让我们之中的一个人免于死亡，那个天使是从天上来的，她即使不能使我们成为朋友（那一点，唉！命中注定是不可能的了），至少可以使我们互相尊重些。” \\n\\n 基督山的眼睛湿润了，嘴微微张出，伸出一只手给阿尔贝，阿尔贝带着一种类似敬畏的神情把它握了一下。“诸位，” \\n\\n 他说，“基督山先生已经接受了我的道歉，昨天我的举动很鲁莽，鲁莽之中总是很容易做错事情的。我做错了事情，但现在我的过错已经弥补了。我的良心要求我这样做的，我希望外界不要称我是一个懦夫。但如果每个人都对我有了错误的认识，”他挺起胸膛，象是在向朋友和仇敌同时挑战似的，“我也愿意纠正他们的。” \\n\\n “那末，昨天晚上发生了什么事呢？”波尚问夏多·勒诺，“我们在这里觉得尴尬极了。” \\n\\n “的确，阿尔贝刚才的举动不是十分可鄙，就是十分高尚。” \\n\\n 夏多·勒诺回答。 \\n\\n “这是什么事？”德布雷对弗兰士说。“基督山伯爵损坏马尔塞夫先生的名誉，而他的儿子竟认为那是应该的！要是我的家庭里也发生过十次亚尼纳事件，我认为自己只有一种义务，那就是——决斗十次。” \\n\\n 再看基督山，他的头低着，两臂软弱无力垂着。在二十四年回忆的重压之下，他没有想到阿尔贝、波尚、夏多·勒诺，或那群人里面的任何一个；但他想了那个勇敢的女人；那个女人曾来乞求他放过她儿子，他用自己的生命献给了她，而她现在则又以吐露一个家庭秘密来拯救了他。这个青年人心里的那片孝心可能因此就全部毁灭了，作为代价。 \\n\\n “上帝还是有的！”他轻声地说，“今天我才相信我是上帝的使者了！” \\n\\n
