{"id":43933,"no":65,"title":"Chapter 70 The Ball","content":"IT WAS in the warmest days of July, when in due course of time the Saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at M. de Morcerf\u0027s. It was ten o\u0027clock at night; the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count\u0027s house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven, which was studded with golden stars, but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered. From the apartments on the ground-floor might be heard the sound of music, with the whirl of the waltz and galop, while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the Venetian blinds. At this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants, who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper, the serenity of the weather continuing to increase. Until now, it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining-room, or under a long tent erected on the lawn, but the beautiful blue sky, studded with stars, had settled the question in favor of the lawn. The gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns, according to the Italian custom, and, as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table--the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form--are well understood, the supper-table was loaded with wax-lights and flowers. At the time the Countess of Morcerf returned to the rooms, after giving her orders, many guests were arriving, more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count; for, owing to the good taste of Mercédès, one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing, or even copying in case of need. Madame Danglars, in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety, had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerf\u0027s, when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort. The latter made a sign, and when the carriages had drawn close together, said,--\"You are going to Madame de Morcerf\u0027s, are you not?\" \"No,\" replied Madame Danglars, \"I am too ill.\" \"You are wrong,\" replied Villefort, significantly; \"it is important that you should be seen there.\" \"Do you think so?\" asked the baroness. \"I do.\" \"In that case I will go.\" And the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations. Madame Danglars therefore came, not only beautiful in person, but radiant with splendor; she entered by one door at the time when Mercédès appeared at the door. The countess took Albert to meet Madame Danglars. He approached, paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet, and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat. Albert looked around him. \"You are looking for my daughter?\" said the baroness, smiling. \"I confess it,\" replied Albert. \"Could you have been so cruel as not to bring her?\" \"Calm yourself. She has met Mademoiselle de Villefort, and has taken her arm; see, they are following us, both in white dresses, one with a bouquet of camellias, the other with one of myosotis. But tell me\"-- \"Well, what do you wish to know?\" \"Will not the Count of Monte Cristo be here to-night?\" \"Seventeen!\" replied Albert. \"What do you mean?\" \"I only mean that the count seems the rage,\" replied the viscount, smiling, \"and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same question. The count is in fashion; I congratulate him upon it.\" \"And have you replied to every one as you have to me?\" \"Ah, to be sure, I have not answered you; be satisfied, we shall have this \u0027lion;\u0027 we are among the privileged ones.\" \"Were you at the opera yesterday?\" \"No.\" \"He was there.\" \"Ah, indeed? And did the eccentric person commit any new originality?\" \"Can he be seen without doing so? Elssler was dancing in the Diable Boiteux; the Greek princess was in ecstasies. After the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet, and threw it to the charming danseuse, who, in the third act, to do honor to the gift, reappeared with it on her finger. And the Greek princess,--will she be here?\" \"No, you will be deprived of that pleasure; her position in the count\u0027s establishment is not sufficiently understood.\" \"Wait; leave me here, and go and speak to Madame de Villefort, who is trying to attract your attention.\" Albert bowed to Madame Danglars, and advanced towards Madame de Villefort, whose lips opened as he approached. \"I wager anything,\" said Albert, interrupting her, \"that I know what you were about to say.\" \"Well, what is it?\" \"If I guess rightly, will you confess it?\" \"Yes.\" \"On your honor?\" \"On my honor.\" \"You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived, or was expected.\" \"Not at all. It is not of him that I am now thinking. I was going to ask you if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz.\" \"Yes,--yesterday.\" \"What did he tell you?\" \"That he was leaving at the same time as his letter.\" \"Well, now then, the count?\" \"The count will come, of that you may be satisfied.\" \"You know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo?\" \"No, I did not know it.\" \"Monte Cristo in the name of an island, and he has a family name.\" \"I never heard it.\" \"Well, then, I am better informed than you; his name is Zaccone.\" \"It is possible.\" \"He is a Maltese.\" \"That is also possible. \"The son of a shipowner.\" \"Really, you should relate all this aloud, you would have the greatest success.\" \"He served in India, discovered a mine in Thessaly, and comes to Paris to establish a mineral water-cure at Auteuil.\" \"Well, I\u0027m sure,\" said Morcerf, \"this is indeed news! Am I allowed to repeat it?\" \"Yes, but cautiously, tell one thing at a time, and do not say I told you.\" \"Why so?\" \"Because it is a secret just discovered.\" \"By whom?\" \"The police.\" \"Then the news originated\"-- \"At the prefect\u0027s last night. Paris, you can understand, is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor, and the police have made inquiries.\" \"Well, well! Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond, on the pretext of his being too rich.\" \"Indeed, that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable.\" \"Poor count! And is he aware of the danger he has been in?\" \"I think not.\" \"Then it will be but charitable to inform him. When he arrives, I will not fail to do so.\" Just then, a handsome young man, with bright eyes, black hair, and glossy mustache, respectfully bowed to Madame de Villefort. Albert extended his hand. \"Madame,\" said Albert, \"allow me to present to you M. Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis, one of our best, and, above all, of our bravest officers.\" \"I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil, at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo,\" replied Madame de Villefort, turning away with marked coldness of manner. This answer, and especially the tone in which it was uttered, chilled the heart of poor Morrel. But a recompense was in store for him; turning around, he saw near the door a beautiful fair face, whose large blue eyes were, without any marked expression, fixed upon him, while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips. The salutation was so well understood that Morrel, with the same expression in his eyes, placed his handkerchief to his mouth; and these two living statues, whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect, separated from each other by the whole length of the room, forgot themselves for a moment, or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation. They might have remained much longer lost in one another, without any one noticing their abstraction. The Count of Monte Cristo had just entered. We have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared. It was not the coat, unexceptional in its cut, though simple and unornamented; it was not the plain white waistcoat; it was not the trousers, that displayed the foot so perfectly formed--it was none of these things that attracted the attention,--it was his pale complexion, his waving black hair, his calm and serene expression, his dark and melancholy eye, his mouth, chiselled with such marvellous delicacy, which so easily expressed such high disdain,--these were what fixed the attention of all upon him. Many men might have been handsomer, but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant, if the expression may be used. Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning, for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face, and even to the most trifling gesture, scarcely to be understood. Yet the Parisian world is so strange, that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune. Meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf, who, standing before a mantle-piece ornamented with flowers, had seen his entrance in a looking-glass placed opposite the door, and was prepared to receive him. She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her. No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her, while on his side the count thought she was about to address him; but both remained silent, and after a mere bow, Monte Cristo directed his steps to Albert, who received him cordially. \"Have you seen my mother?\" asked Albert. \"I have just had the pleasure,\" replied the count; \"but I have not seen your father.\" \"See, he is down there, talking politics with that little group of great geniuses.\" \"Indeed?\" said Monte Cristo; \"and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent. I should not have guessed it. And for what kind of talent are they celebrated? You know there are different sorts.\" \"That tall, harsh-looking man is very learned, he discovered, in the neighborhood of Rome, a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have, and he immediately laid his discovery before the Institute. The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided in his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion of Honor, was made an officer.\" \"Come,\" said Monte Cristo, \"this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they would have made him a commander.\" \"Very likely,\" said Albert. \"And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?\" \"Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic\u0027s, which deputed David* to devise a uniform for the Academicians.\" * Louis David, a famous French painter. \"Indeed?\" said Monte Cristo; \"so this gentleman is an Academician?\" \"Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.\" \"And what is his especial talent?\" \"His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he makes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whalebone.\" \"And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?\" \"No; of the French Academy.\" \"But what has the French Academy to do with all this?\" \"I was going to tell you. It seems\"-- \"That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science, doubtless?\" \"No; that his style of writing is very good.\" \"This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?\" Albert laughed. \"And the other one?\" demanded the count. \"That one?\" \"Yes, the third.\" \"The one in the dark blue coat?\" \"Yes.\" \"He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was very successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal papers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an ambassador.\" \"And what are his claims to the peerage?\" \"He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five articles in the Siecle, and voted five or six years on the ministerial side.\" \"Bravo, Viscount,\" said Monte Cristo, smiling; \"you are a delightful cicerone. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?\" \"What is it?\" \"Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish it, you will warn me.\" Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He turned round; it was Danglars. \"Ah, is it you, baron?\" said he. \"Why do you call me baron?\" said Danglars; \"you know that I care nothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title, do you not?\" \"Certainly,\" replied Albert, \"seeing that without my title I should be nothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the millionaire.\" \"Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,\" replied Danglars. \"Unfortunately,\" said Monte Cristo, \"one\u0027s title to a millionaire does not last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or Academician; for example, the millionaires Franck \u0026 Poulmann, of Frankfort, who have just become bankrupts.\" \"Indeed?\" said Danglars, becoming pale. \"Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a million in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month ago.\" \"Ah, mon Dieu,\" exclaimed Danglars, \"they have drawn on me for 200,000 francs!\" \"Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per cent.\" \"Yes, but it is too late,\" said Danglars, \"I have honored their bills.\" \"Then,\" said Monte Cristo, \"here are 200,000 francs gone after\"-- \"Hush, do not mention these things,\" said Danglars; then, approaching Monte Cristo, he added, \"especially before young M. Cavalcanti;\" after which he smiled, and turned towards the young man in question. Albert had left the count to speak to his mother, Danglars to converse with young Cavalcanti; Monte Cristo was for an instant alone. Meanwhile the heat became excessive. The footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices. Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead, but drew back when the waiter was presented to him; he took no refreshment. Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo; she saw that he took nothing, and even noticed his gesture of refusal. \"Albert,\" she asked, \"did you notice that?\" \"What, mother?\" \"That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of M. de Morcerf.\" \"Yes; but then he breakfasted with me--indeed, he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion.\" \"But your house is not M. de Morcerf\u0027s,\" murmured Mercédès; \"and since he has been here I have watched him.\" \"Well?\" \"Well, he has taken nothing yet.\" \"The count is very temperate.\" Mercédès smiled sadly. \"Approach him,\" said she, \"and when the next waiter passes, insist upon his taking something.\" \"But why, mother?\" \"Just to please me, Albert,\" said Mercédès. Albert kissed his mother\u0027s hand, and drew near the count. Another salver passed, loaded like the preceding ones; she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count, but he obstinately refused. Albert rejoined his mother; she was very pale. \"Well,\" said she, \"you see he refuses?\" \"Yes; but why need this annoy you?\" \"You know, Albert, women are singular creatures. I should like to have seen the count take something in my house, if only an ice. Perhaps he cannot reconcile himself to the French style of living, and might prefer something else.\" \"Oh, no; I have seen him eat of everything in Italy; no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening.\" \"And besides,\" said the countess, \"accustomed as he is to burning climates, possibly he does not feel the heat as we do.\" \"I do not think that, for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated, and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows.\" \"In a word,\" said Mercédès, \"it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended.\" And she left the room. A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open, and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns, and the supper laid under the tent. Dancers, players, talkers, all uttered an exclamation of joy--every one inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in. At the same time Mercédès reappeared, paler than before, but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore. She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre. \"Do not detain those gentlemen here, count,\" she said; \"they would prefer, I should think, to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here, since they are not playing.\" \"Ah,\" said a gallant old general, who, in 1809, had sung Partant pour la Syrie!--\"we will not go alone to the garden.\" 这几天正是七月里最炎热的日子，马尔塞夫伯爵如期在星期六举行舞会。晚上十点钟。在伯爵府的花园里，高大的树木清晰地衬托着缀满金色星星的天空。今天象要下暴雨的样子，天空上现在还浮荡着一层薄雾。楼下的大厅里传出华尔兹和极乐舞的乐曲，百叶窗的窗缝里透出灿烂的灯光。这时，花园里有十来个仆人在那儿准备晚餐，他们刚刚接到主妇的命令，因为天气好转。已决定晚餐在草坪上的天幕下举行，那缀满星星的美丽的蓝空已使草坪占了决定的优势。花园里挂满了彩色的灯笼，这是按照意大利的风俗布置的，席面上布满了蜡烛和鲜花，这种排场世界各国豪华的席面上处处都一样，不必多讲。 马尔塞夫伯爵夫人吩咐过仆人以后，又回到屋里去，这时宾客们陆续到来，吸引他们来的多半不是由于伯爵的地位显赫，而是由于伯爵夫人优雅风度，因为由于美塞苔丝的高雅的情趣，他们一定可以在她的宴会上找到一些值得叙述，甚至值得模仿的布置方法。腾格拉尔夫人本来不想到马尔塞夫夫人那儿去，因为前面说过的那几件事使她心神不宁，但那天早晨，她的马车碰巧在路上和维尔福先生的马车相遇。两部马车很自然地并拢来，他说：“马尔塞夫夫人家的舞会您去不去？” “不想去，”腾格拉尔夫人回答，“我的身体太不舒服。” “您错了，”维尔福意味深长地回答，“您应该在那儿露面，这是很重要的。” “那么我就去。”说完两部马车就分道而驶了。 所以腾格拉尔夫人这会儿也来了。她不但长得美，而且周身上下打扮得珠光宝气；她从一扇门走进客厅，美塞苔丝正好也从另一扇门出现在客厅，伯爵夫人当即派阿尔贝去迎接腾格拉尔夫人。他迎上前去，对男爵夫人的打扮讲了几句恰如其分的恭维话，然后让她挽住他的胳膊引她入座。阿尔贝向四下里望望。 “您在找我的女儿，是不是？”男爵夫人含笑说。 “我承认是的，”阿尔贝回答。“难道您竟忍心没有带她来吗？” “别着急。她遇到了维尔福小姐，她们两个就走在一起了。瞧，她们来了，两个都穿着白衣服，一个捧着一束山茶花，一个捧着一束毋忘我花。哎，怎么” “这回您找什么？” “基督山伯爵今天晚上来不来？” “十七个了！”阿尔贝答道。 “您这是什么意思？” “我是说，伯爵似乎是一团烈火，”子爵微笑着回答，“你是第十七个问我这个问题的人了。伯爵有多走红，我可真得祝贺他” “您对每一个人都是象对我这样回答的吗？” “啊！真是的，我还没有回答您。请放心，我们可以看到这位大人物。我们的运气够好的。” “昨晚您去歌剧院了吗？” “没有。” “他也在那儿。” “啊，真的！那位怪人有没有什么惊人之举？” “他能没有惊人之举吗？”昨天演的是《瘸腿魔鬼》 ［法国作家勒萨日（一六八八—一七四七）的作品，这里可能指根据原作改编的舞剧。——译注］，伊丽莎跳舞的时候，那位希腊公主看得出了神。伊丽莎跳完舞以后，他把一只珍贵的戒指绑在一束花球上，抛给那个可爱的舞星，那个舞星为了表示珍视这件礼物，在第三幕的时候，就把它戴在手指上出场，向伯爵致意。那位希腊公主呢？她来不来？” “不来，可能使您失望了，她在伯爵家里的地位没人知道。” “行了，让我留在这儿吧，去陪维尔福夫人吧，她很想跟您谈话呢。” 阿尔贝对腾格拉尔夫人鞠了一躬，向维尔福夫人走过去。 当他走近的时候，她张开嘴巴刚要说话。“我敢跟你打赌，”阿尔贝打断她说，“我知道您要说的是什么事。” “什么事？” “如果我猜对了，您承不承认？” “承认。” “用人格担保？” “用人格担保。” “您要问我基督山伯爵到了没有，或者会不会来。” “一点也不对。我现在想的不是他。我要问您有没有接到弗兰兹先生的什么消息？” “有的，昨天收到了一封信。” “他信里说些什么？” ”他发封信时正启程回来。” “好，现在，告诉我伯爵会不会来。” “伯爵会来的，不会使您失望。” “您知道他除了基督山以外还有一个名字吗？” “不，我不知道。” “基督山是一个岛的名字，他有一个族姓。” “我从来没听说过。” “好，那么，我比您消息灵通了，他姓柴康。” “有可能。” “他是马耳他人。” “也可能的。” “他是一个船主的儿子。” “真的，您应该把这些事情大声宣布出来，您就可以大出风头了。” “他在印度服过兵役，在塞萨利发现了一个银矿，到巴黎来是想在欧特伊村建立一所温泉疗养院。” “哦！马尔塞夫说，“我敢断言，这实在是新闻！允许我讲给别人听吗？” “可以，但不要一下子捅出去，每次只讲一件事情，别说是我告诉您的。” “为什么？” “因为这是偶然发现的秘密。” “谁发现的。” “警务部。” “那么这些消息的来源——” “是昨天晚上从总监那里听来的。您当然也明白，巴黎对于这样不寻常的豪华人物总是有戒备的，所以警务部去调查了一下。” “好！现在手续齐备，可以借口伯爵太有钱，把他当作流民抓起来了。” “可不是，如果调查到的情况不是那么对他有利的话，这种事情无疑是会发生的。” “可怜的伯爵！他知道自己处境这么危险吗？” “我想不知道吧。” “那么应该发发慈悲心去通知他。他来的时候，我一定这样做。” 这时，一个眼睛明亮、头发乌黑、髭须光润的英俊年轻人过来向维尔福夫人恭恭敬敬地鞠了一躬。阿尔贝和他握握手。“夫人，”阿尔贝说，“允许我向您介绍马西米兰·莫雷尔先生，驻阿尔及利亚的骑兵上尉，是我们最出色、最勇敢的军官之一。” “我在欧特伊基督山伯爵的家里已经有幸见过这位先生了。”维尔福夫人回答，带着不用掩饰的冷淡态度转身离去。 这句话语，尤其是说这句话的那种口气，使可怜的莫雷尔的心揪紧了。可是有一种补偿正在等候他。他转过身来，正巧看到一张美丽白皙的面孔，上面那一对蓝色的大眼睛正注视着他，那对眼睛里并没有什么明显的表情，但她把手里的那一束毋忘我花慢慢地举到她唇边。 莫雷尔对这种无声的问候心领神会，他也望着她，把他手帕举到嘴唇上。他们象两尊活的雕像，已佇立大厅两端，默默地互相凝视着，一时忘掉了他们自己，甚至忘掉了世界，但在他们那种大理石似的外表底下，他们的心却在剧烈地狂跳。 即使他们再多望很多时候，也不会有人注意到他们，可是基督山伯爵进来了。我们已经说过，伯爵不论在哪儿出现，他总能吸引大家的注意力。那并不是因为他的衣着，他的衣服简单朴素，剪裁也没有什么新奇怪诞的地方；更不是因为那件纯白的背心；也不是因为那条衬托出一双有模有样的脚的裤子——吸引旁人注意的不是这些东西，而是他那苍白的肤色和他那漆黑的卷发，他安详清纯的脸容；是那一双深邃、表情抑郁的眼睛；是那一张轮廓清楚、这样易于表达高度轻蔑表情的嘴巴。比他更漂亮的人或许还有很多，谁也不会有他这么富有表现力，如可以用这个词来形容的话。伯爵身上的一切似乎都有其含义，因为他有常作有益思索的习惯，所以无关紧要的动作，也会在他的脸上表现出无比的精明和刚强。 可是，巴黎社会的社交界是这样的不可思议，如果除此以外他没有一笔巨大的财产染上神秘色彩，这一切或许还是不能赢得他们的注意。 这时，他在无数好奇的眼光的注视之下，一面和熟人略作招呼，一面向马尔塞夫夫人走过去，马尔塞夫夫人正站在摆着几只花瓶的壁炉架子前面，已经从一面与门相对的镜子里看见他进来，已经准备好和他相见。伯爵向她鞠躬的时候，她带着一个开朗的微笑向他转过身来。她以为伯爵会和她讲话，而伯爵，也以为她会和自己说话，但两人都没有开口。于是，在鞠躬之后，基督山就迈步向阿尔贝迎过去，阿尔贝正张着双臂向他走来。 “您见过我母亲了吗？”阿尔贝问。 “见过了，”伯爵回答，“但我还没有见过令尊。” “瞧，他就在那面，正在和那群社会名流谈论政治呢。” “是吗？”基督山说，“那么，那面的那些先生都是社会名流。我倒没有想到。他们是哪一类方面的？您知道社会名流也有各种各样的。” “首先，是一位学者就是那位瘦高个儿，他在罗马附近发现一种蜥蜴，那种蜥蜴的脊椎骨比普通的多一节，他立刻把他的发现在科学院提出。对那件事一直有人持异议，但他取得了胜利。那节脊椎骨在学术界引起了轰动了，而那位先生，他本来只是荣誉军团的一个骑士，就此晋封为军官。” “哦，”基督山说，“据我看，这个十字章是该给的，我想，要是他再找到一节脊椎骨的话，他们就会封他做司令官了吧？” “极有可能。”阿尔贝说。 “那个穿蓝底绣绿花礼服的人是谁？他怎么竟想出穿这样一件怪衣服？” “噢，那件衣服不是他自己想出来的，那是法兰西共和国的象征。共和政府委托大画家大卫［大卫（一七四八—一八二五），法国著名画家，同情法国大革命。——译注］给法兰西科学院院士设计的一种制服。” “真的吗！”基督山说，“那么这位先生是一位科学院院士吗？” “他在一星期前刚被推举为一位学者。” “他的特殊才能是什么？” “他的才能我相信他能够用小针戳兔子的头，他能让母鸡吃茜草，他能够用鲸须挑出狗的脊髓。” “为了这些成绩，他成为科学院的院士了吗？” “不，是法兰西学院的院士。” “但法兰四学院跟这一切有什么关系呢？” “我就要告诉您了。看来似乎是因为——” “一定因为他的实验大大地促进了科学的发展罗？” “不，是因为他的书法非常挺秀。” “这句话要是被那些让他用针戳过的兔子，那些骨头被他用茜草染成红色的鸡以及那些被他挑过脊髓的狗听到，它们一定要伤心死了。” 阿尔贝大笑起来。 “那一位呢？”伯爵问。 “哪一位？” “是的，第三位。” “啊！穿暗蓝色衣服的那位？” “对。” “他是伯爵的一个同僚，前一阵子极力反对贵族院的议员穿制服，他是自由主义派报纸的死对头，但因为他在制服问题上所做的抨击朝廷的高尚行动，自由派报纸大大为他捧场，这使他们言归于好，而且据说就要派他做大使了。” “他是凭什么资格入贵族院的？” “他曾编过两三部喜剧，在《世纪》报上写过四五篇文章，为部长大人当选捧了五六次场。” “说得妙，子爵！”基督山微笑着说，“您是一位很有趣的导游。现在请您帮我一个忙，可不可以？” “什么事？” “别介绍我认识这几位先生，如果他们有这个意思，请您为我挡驾。” 这时，伯爵觉得有人抓住了他的胳膊。他转过身来，原来是腾格拉尔。“啊！是您，男爵！” “您为什么要称呼我男爵呢？”腾格拉尔说，“您知道我对于我的头衔并不重视。我不象您，子爵，您很看重爵位是不是？” “当然罗，”阿尔贝回答，“我要是没有了头衔，就一无所有了，而您，既使放弃男爵的头衔，却依旧不失为百万富翁。” “不幸的是，”基督山说，“百万富翁这个头衔可不象男爵、法国贵族或科学院院士那样可以终身保持的，譬如说，法兰克福的百万富翁，法波银行的大股东法郎克和波尔曼，最近就宣告破产了。” “真的吗？”腾格拉尔说，脸色顿时变得苍白。 “不会有错，我是今天傍晚才得到的消息，我有一百万存在他们银行，但及时得到警告，在一个月以前就提出来了。” “啊，我的上帝！”腾格拉尔喊道，“他们开了一张二十万法郎的汇票给我！” “您可得小心一点，他们的签字只剩百分之五的信用了。” “是的，但太迟啦，”腾格拉尔说，“我看到签字的票据就照付了。” “得！”基督山说，“又是二十万法郎，加上以前“嘘！别提这些事情，”腾格拉尔说，然后，他向基督山凑近一步，又说，“尤其是在小卡瓦尔康蒂先生面前。”说完以后，他微笑了一下，转身向他所指的那个年轻人走去。 阿尔贝离开伯爵去和他的母亲说话，腾格拉尔也已去和小卡瓦尔康蒂谈天，暂时只剩下基督山独自一个。这当儿，大厅里非常热。仆人托着摆满冷饮品的茶盘在人群里穿梭往来。 基督山不时擦着额头上的汗珠，但当仆人把盘子端到他面前来的时候，他却退后一步，不吃解热的东西。马尔塞夫夫人的眼光始终没有离开基督山，她看到他什么都没有吃过，甚至还注意到了他往后退的那个动作。 “阿尔贝，”她问道，“你注意到没有？” “什么事，母亲？” “我们请伯爵来赴宴，他从来没有接受过。” “是的，但他在我那儿吃过午饭，真的，那次他还是初次在巴黎社交界露面呢。” “但你的家并不是马尔塞夫先生的家，”美塞苔丝喃喃说，“他来这儿以后，我一直在观察他。” “是吗？” “是的，他没有吃过任何东西。” “伯爵的饮食是很节制的。” 美塞苔丝抑郁地微笑了一下。“你再过去，”她说，“等下一次托盘送来的时候，务必请他吃些东西。” “为什么，母亲？” “听我的话，阿尔贝。”美塞苔丝说。 阿尔贝拿起他母亲的手吻了一下，踱到伯爵身边。又有一只摆满冷饮品的盘子送了来，她看到阿尔贝想劝伯爵吃些东西，但他却坚决地拒绝了。阿尔贝回到母亲那儿，她的脸色非常苍白。 “是吧，”她说，“你看到他拒绝了吗！” “是的，但您何必因此难过呢？” “你知道，阿尔贝，女人的心是很奇怪的，我喜欢看到伯爵在我的家里吃些东西，即使一粒石榴也好。也许他不习惯法国的饮食，喜欢吃别的东西吧。” “哦，不会的。在意大利的时候，我看他是什么都吃的，显然他今天晚上不想吃东西。” “也许是”伯爵夫人说，“他是在热带过惯了的，他可能不象我们这样怕热。” “我想不见得，因为他刚才还向我诉苦说，他感到热得几乎要窒息了，还问我为什么不把百叶窗也象玻璃那样打开。” “可不是，”美塞苔丝说，“这倒是个好办法，可以试试他是否故意不肯吃东西。”于是她离开大厅。一分钟以后，百叶窗全部打开了，透过那些垂下素馨花和女萎草的窗口，可以看到点缀着各色灯笼的花园和摆列在帐幕底下的宴席。跳舞的，玩牌的，谈话的所有的客人都发出了欢快的喊声。每一个人都欢欢喜喜地享受着微风。这时，美塞苔丝重新出现，她的脸色比以前更苍白了，但神色很镇定。她一直向以她丈夫为中心的那群人走过去。“别把这几位先生拖在这儿，伯爵，” 她说，“我想，他们大概都愿意到花园里透透气，太闷了，他们不是在玩牌。” “啊，”一个风流的老将军说，“我们不愿意单独到花园里去。” “那么，”美塞苔丝说，“我来领路。”她转向基督山，又说，“伯爵，您可以陪我去走走吗？”
