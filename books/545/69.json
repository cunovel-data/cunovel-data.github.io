{"id":43937,"no":69,"title":"Chapter 74 The Villefort Family Vault","content":"TWO DAYS after, a considerable crowd was assembled, towards ten o\u0027clock in the morning, around the door of M. de Villefort\u0027s house, and a long file of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré and the Rue de la Pepiniere. Among them was one of a very singular form, which appeared to have come from a distance. It was a kind of covered wagon, painted black, and was one of the first to arrive. Inquiry was made, and it was ascertained that, by a strange coincidence, this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de Saint-Méran, and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two. Their number was great. The Marquis de Saint-Méran, one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII and King Charles X, had preserved a great number of friends, and these, added to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a claim on, formed a considerable body. \n Due information was given to the authorities, and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time. A second hearse, decked with the same funereal pomp, was brought to M. de Villefort\u0027s door, and the coffin removed into it from the post-wagon. The two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of Père-la-Chaise, where M. de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family. The remains of poor Renée were already deposited there, and now, after ten years of separation, her father and mother were to be reunited with her. The Parisians, always curious, always affected by funereal display, looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy--the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles. In one of the mourning-coaches Beauchamp, Debray, and Chateau-Renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness. \"I saw Madame de Saint-Méran only last year at Marseilles, when I was coming back from Algiers,\" said Chateau-Renaud; \"she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old, from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body. How old was she?\" \n \"Franz assured me,\" replied Albert, \"that she was sixty-six years old. But she has not died of old age, but of grief; it appears that since the death of the marquis, which affected her very deeply, she has not completely recovered her reason.\" \n \"But of what disease, then, did she die?\" asked Debray. \n \"It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which is the same thing, is it not?\" \n \"Nearly.\" \n \"It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,\" said Beauchamp. \"Madame de Saint-Méran, whom I once saw, was short, of slender form, and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de Saint-Méran.\" \n \"At any rate,\" said Albert, \"whatever disease or doctor may have killed her, M. de Villefort, or rather, Mademoiselle Valentine,--or, still rather, our friend Franz, inherits a magnificent fortune, amounting, I believe, to 80,000 livres per annum.\" \n \"And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin, Noirtier.\" \n \"That is a tenacious old grandfather,\" said Beauchamp. \"Tenacem propositi virum. I think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed. He resembles the old Conventionalist of \u002793, who said to Napoleon, in 1814, \u0027You bend because your empire is a young stem, weakened by rapid growth. Take the Republic for a tutor; let us return with renewed strength to the battle-field, and I promise you 500,000 soldiers, another Marengo, and a second Austerlitz. Ideas do not become extinct, sire; they slumber sometimes, but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely.\u0027 Ideas and men appeared the same to him. One thing only puzzles me, namely, how Franz d\u0027Epinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his wife. But where is Franz?\" \n \"In the first carriage, with M. de Villefort, who considers him already as one of the family.\" \n Such was the conversation in almost all the carriages; these two sudden deaths, so quickly following each other, astonished every one, but no one suspected the terrible secret which M. d\u0027Avrigny had communicated, in his nocturnal walk to M. de Villefort. They arrived in about an hour at the cemetery; the weather was mild, but dull, and in harmony with the funeral ceremony. Among the groups which flocked towards the family vault, Chateau-Renaud recognized Morrel, who had come alone in a cabriolet, and walked silently along the path bordered with yew-trees. \"You here?\" said Chateau-Renaud, passing his arms through the young captain\u0027s; \"are you a friend of Villefort\u0027s? How is it that I have never met you at his house?\" \n \"I am no acquaintance of M. de Villefort\u0027s.\" answered Morrel, \"but I was of Madame de Saint-Méran.\" Albert came up to them at this moment with Franz. \n \"The time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.\" said Albert; \"but we are not superstitious. M. Morrel, allow me to present to you M. Franz d\u0027Epinay, a delightful travelling companion, with whom I made the tour of Italy. My dear Franz, M. Maximilian Morrel, an excellent friend I have acquired in your absence, and whose name you will hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection, wit, or amiability.\" Morrel hesitated for a moment; he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing, but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory; he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz. \"Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow, is she not?\" said Debray to Franz. \n \"Extremely,\" replied he; \"she looked so pale this morning, I scarcely knew her.\" These apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the heart. This man had seen Valentine, and spoken to her! The young and high-spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath. He took the arm of Chateau-Renaud, and turned towards the vault, where the attendants had already placed the two coffins. \"This is a magnificent habitation,\" said Beauchamp, looking towards the mausoleum; \"a summer and winter palace. You will, in turn, enter it, my dear d\u0027Epinay, for you will soon be numbered as one of the family. I, as a philosopher, should like a little country-house, a cottage down there under the trees, without so many free-stones over my poor body. In dying, I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron: \u0027Eo rus, and all will be over.\u0027 But come, Franz, take courage, your wife is an heiress.\" \n \"Indeed, Beauchamp, you are unbearable. Politics has made you laugh at everything, and political men have made you disbelieve everything. But when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men, and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment, try to find your affectionate heart, which you leave with your stick when you go to the Chamber.\" \n \"But tell me,\" said Beauchamp, \"what is life? Is it not a hall in Death\u0027s anteroom?\" \n \"I am prejudiced against Beauchamp,\" said Albert, drawing Franz away, and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with Debray. The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones, about twenty feet high; an interior partition separated the two families, and each apartment had its entrance door. Here were not, as in other tombs, ignoble drawers, one above another, where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum; all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy-looking room, separated by a wall from the vault itself. The two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall, and enclosed the Villefort and Saint-Méran coffins. There grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit Père-la-Chaise, or by lovers who make it their rendezvous. \n The two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the right-hand crypt belonging to the Saint-Méran family. Villefort, Franz, and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary. \n As the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door, and there was no address given, the party all separated; Chateau-Renaud, Albert, and Morrel, went one way, and Debray and Beauchamp the other. Franz remained with M. de Villefort; at the gate of the cemetery Morrel made an excuse to wait; he saw Franz and M. de Villefort get into the same mourning coach, and thought this meeting forboded evil. He then returned to Paris, and although in the same carriage with Chateau-Renaud and Albert, he did not hear one word of their conversation. As Franz was about to take leave of M. de Villefort, \"When shall I see you again?\" said the latter. \n \"At what time you please, sir,\" replied Franz. \n \"As soon as possible.\" \n \"I am at your command, sir; shall we return together?\" \n \"If not unpleasant to you.\" \n \"On the contrary, I shall feel much pleasure.\" Thus, the future father and son-in-law stepped into the same carriage, and Morrel, seeing them pass, became uneasy. Villefort and Franz returned to the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. The procureur, without going to see either his wife or his daughter, went at once to his study, and, offering the young man a chair,--\"M. d\u0027Epinay,\" said he, \"allow me to remind you at this moment,--which is perhaps not so ill-chosen as at first sight may appear, for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb,--allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by Madame de Saint-Méran on her death-bed, that Valentine\u0027s wedding might not be deferred. You know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order, and her will bequeaths to Valentine the entire property of the Saint-Méran family; the notary showed me the documents yesterday, which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately. You may call on the notary, M. Deschamps, Place Beauveau, Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and you have my authority to inspect those deeds.\" \n \"Sir,\" replied M. d\u0027Epinay, \"it is not, perhaps, the moment for Mademoiselle Valentine, who is in deep distress, to think of a husband; indeed, I fear\"-- \n \"Valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmother\u0027s last injunctions; there will be no obstacle from that quarter, I assure you.\" \n \"In that case,\" replied Franz, \"as I shall raise none, you may make arrangements when you please; I have pledged my word, and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it.\" \n \"Then,\" said Villefort, \"nothing further is required. The contract was to have been signed three days since; we shall find it all ready, and can sign it to-day.\" \n \"But the mourning?\" said Franz, hesitating. \n \"Don\u0027t be uneasy on that score,\" replied Villefort; \"no ceremony will be neglected in my house. Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of Saint-Méran; I say hers, for she inherits it to-day. There, after a few days, if you like, the civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony. Madame de Saint-Méran wished her daughter should be married there. When that in over, you, sir, can return to Paris, while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her mother-in-law.\" \n \"As you please, sir,\" said Franz. \n \"Then,\" replied M. de Villefort, \"have the kindness to wait half an hour; Valentine shall come down into the drawing-room. I will send for M. Deschamps; we will read and sign the contract before we separate, and this evening Madame de Villefort; shall accompany Valentine to her estate, where we will rejoin them in a week.\" \n \"Sir,\" said Franz, \"I have one request to make.\" \n \"What is it?\" \n \"I wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de Chateau-Renaud to be present at this signature; you know they are my witnesses.\" \n \"Half an hour will suffice to apprise them; will you go for them yourself, or shall you send?\" \n \"I prefer going, sir.\" \n \"I shall expect you, then, in half an hour, baron, and Valentine will be ready.\" Franz bowed and left the room. Scarcely had the door closed, when M. de Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawing-room in half an hour, as he expected the notary and M. d\u0027Epinay and his witnesses. The news caused a great sensation throughout the house; Madame de Villefort would not believe it, and Valentine was thunderstruck. She looked around for help, and would have gone down to her grandfather\u0027s room, but on the stairs she met M. de Villefort, who took her arm and led her into the drawing-room. In the anteroom, Valentine met Barrois, and looked despairingly at the old servant. A moment later, Madame de Villefort entered the drawing-room with her little Edward. It was evident that she had shared the grief of the family, for she was pale and looked fatigued. She sat down, took Edward on her knees, and from time to time pressed this child, on whom her affections appeared centred, almost convulsively to her bosom. Two carriages were soon heard to enter the court yard. One was the notary\u0027s; the other, that of Franz and his friends. In a moment the whole party was assembled. Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples, round her eyes and down her cheeks. Franz was deeply affected. Chateau-Renaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement; the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin. Madame de Villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain, and as she constantly bent over her child, it was difficult to read the expression of her face. M. de Villefort was, as usual, unmoved. \n The notary, after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table, taken his place in an armchair, and raised his spectacles, turned towards Franz: \n \"Are you M. Franz de Quesnel, baron d\u0027Epinay?\" asked he, although he knew it perfectly. \n \"Yes, sir,\" replied Franz. The notary bowed. \"I have, then, to inform you, sir, at the request of M. de Villefort, that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed the feeling of M. Noirtier towards his grandchild, and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her. Let me hasten to add,\" continued he, \"that the testator, having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune, and having alienated it all, the will will not bear scrutiny, and is declared null and void.\" \n \"Yes.\" said Villefort; \"but I warn M. d\u0027Epinay, that during my life-time my father\u0027s will shall never be questioned, my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained.\" \n \"Sir,\" said Franz, \"I regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine; I have never inquired the amount of her fortune, which, however limited it may be, exceeds mine. My family has sought consideration in this alliance with M. de Villefort; all I seek is happiness.\" Valentine imperceptibly thanked him, while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks. \"Besides, sir,\" said Villefort, addressing himself to his future son-in-law, \"excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes, this unexpected will need not personally wound you; M. Noirtier\u0027s weakness of mind sufficiently explains it. It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is going to marry you that he is angry, but because she will marry, a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow. Old age is selfish, sir, and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to M. Noirtier, which she cannot be when she becomes the Baroness d\u0027Epinay. My father\u0027s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects, which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding, and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time, although, he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married, M. Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson.\" M. de Villefort had scarcely said this, when the door opened, and Barrois appeared. \n \"Gentlemen,\" said he, in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances,--\"gentlemen, M. Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M. Franz de Quesnel, baron d\u0027Epinay;\" he, as well as the notary, that there might be no mistake in the person, gave all his titles to the bride-groom elect. \n Villefort started, Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees, Valentine rose, pale and dumb as a statue. Albert and Chateau-Renaud exchanged a second look, more full of amazement than the first. The notary looked at Villefort. \"It is impossible,\" said the procureur. \"M. d\u0027Epinay cannot leave the drawing-room at present.\" \n \"It is at this moment,\" replied Barrois with the same firmness, \"that M. Noirtier, my master, wishes to speak on important subjects to M. Franz d\u0027Epinay.\" \n \"Grandpapa Noirtier can speak now, then,\" said Edward, with his habitual quickness. However, his remark did not make Madame de Villefort even smile, so much was every mind engaged, and so solemn was the situation. Astonishment was at its height. Something like a smile was perceptible on Madame de Villefort\u0027s countenance. Valentine instinctively raised her eyes, as if to thank heaven. \n \"Pray go, Valentine,\" said; M. de Villefort, \"and see what this new fancy of your grandfather\u0027s is.\" Valentine rose quickly, and was hastening joyfully towards the door, when M. de Villefort altered his intention. \n \"Stop,\" said he; \"I will go with you.\" \n \"Excuse me, sir,\" said Franz, \"since M. Noirtier sent for me, I am ready to attend to his wish; besides, I shall be happy to pay my respects to him, not having yet had the honor of doing so.\" \n \"Pray, sir,\" said Villefort with marked uneasiness, \"do not disturb yourself.\" \n 两天以后，早晨十点钟的光景，维尔福先生的门前聚集着很大的一群人。一长列丧车和私家马车从圣·奥诺路一直伸展到庇比尼路。在诸多马车里，有一辆车子的样式非常古怪，看来象是从外地来的。那是一种带蓬的大车，车身是黑色的，是最先来参加送葬的车子之一。有人问这是怎么一回事。据打听的结果，原来真是巧合得出奇：圣·梅朗侯爵的遗体就在这辆车子里，人们最初以为只来为一个人送丧，现在却要跟在两具尸体后面走了。圣·梅朗侯爵是国王路易十八和查理王十世最忠实的大臣之一，他的朋友很多；这些，再加上应维尔福的社会声望而来的一批人，就成了很大的一群。 \n 当局得到通知，准许两件丧事同时举行，第二辆柩车装饰得极其华丽，车一驶到维尔福先生门口，里面的那口棺材就搬进那辆柩车里。维尔福先生早就在拉雪兹神父墓地选好了家墓，准备安葬他的家属，这两具遗体就葬在那儿。可怜的蕾妮早已等在那儿，十年的分别以后，现在她又可以和她的父母相聚在一起了。巴黎人永远是好奇的，看见大出丧老是很爱激动，他们带着宗教的虔敬，目送着那壮观的行列陪伴着这两个老贵族到他们最后的安息地去。两个以最忠实可靠、最坚守传统习惯和信仰最坚定著称的老贵族。在一辆丧车里，波尚、阿尔贝和夏多·勒诺在谈论侯爵夫人的猝死。 \n “去年我还在马赛见过圣·梅朗夫人，”夏多·勒诺说，“我还以为她可以活到一百岁呢，因为她身体极好，头脑很活跃，身子骨也很棒，她有多大年龄了？” \n “弗兰兹告诉我，”阿尔贝答道，“她有七十岁了。她不是死于年老衰弱而是愁死的，侯爵的死她非常悲痛，自从侯爵死后，她的理智似乎始终没有完全恢复过。” \n “但她是生什么病死的呢？”波尚问道。 \n “据说是脑充血，也许是中风，那两种病症差不多的，是不是？” \n “差不多。” \n “中风是不大可能，”波尚说，“我曾见过圣·梅朗夫人一两次，身材很矮很瘦，是一个神经质而不是多血质的人。象圣·梅朗夫人这样的体质，不可能因悲哀过度而中风的。” \n “总而言之，”阿尔贝说，“不论杀死她的是疾病还是医生，维尔福先生，说得确切些，我们的朋友弗兰兹，是要继承一笔很可观的遗产，我相信他因此每年可以增加八万里弗的收入。” \n “等到那个老雅各宾党徒诺瓦蒂埃去世的时候，他的财产还可以再加一倍。” \n “那真是一个意志顽强的老爷爷，”波尚说——“就象贺拉斯说的‘意志坚强的人’。我想，他一定和死神有协定，要看到所有的子女落葬。他很象一七九三年的那个老国民议会议员，这人在一八一四年对拿破仑说：‘您之所以失败，是因为您的帝国一是棵年轻的花草，由于生长得太快，所以茎子特别脆弱。请把共和国作为一个支柱，让我们养好了气力再回到战场上去，我保证您可以拥有五十万军队，再来一次马伦戈大捷和第二次的奥斯特利茨战役。观念是会绝灭的，陛下，它们有时会打一个嗑睡，但在完全睡醒以后，比睡着以前更强劲有力。” \n “在他看来，”阿尔贝说，“观念和人似乎是一样的东西。有一件事情我不理解——弗兰兹·伊皮奈怎么能守着一位不能和他的妻子分离的太岳父？日子可怎么过？但弗兰兹在哪儿？” \n “在最前面的那辆车子里，跟维尔福先生在一起，维尔福先生已经把他当作家庭的一员了。” \n 在所有的车子里，人们的谈话几乎都是一样的。这两个人死得这样突然，而且这样迅速地接连到来，所以每一个人都很奇怪，但谁都没有怀疑过什么，阿夫里尼先生在黑夜里告诉维尔福先生的那种可怕的秘密，更没有人想过，大约一小时他们到达了坟场。天气温和而晦暗，很适宜于举行葬礼。 \n 在那一群向家墓拥过去的人堆里，夏多·勒诺认出了莫雷尔，他是独自乘着一辆轻便马车来的。他的脸色很苍白，正在无言地沿着那条两旁水松夹持的小径走着，“你在这儿！”夏多·勒诺挽住那青年上尉的胳膊说。“你是维尔福的朋友吗？我怎么从来没有在他的家里碰到过你呢？” \n “我并不认识维尔福先生，”莫雷尔答道，“但我认识圣·梅朗夫人。” \n 这时，阿尔贝和弗兰兹上来了。“时间和地点实在并不适宜于作介绍，”阿尔贝说，“但我们不是迷信的人。莫雷尔先生，允许我给您介绍弗兰兹·伊皮奈先生。他是一位有趣的旅伴，我曾和他一同周游过意大利。我亲爱的弗兰兹，这位是马西米兰·莫雷尔先生。当我不认识你的时候，我们就是好朋友了，很快你就会知道，凡是我要说到友爱、机智、和蔼的时候，都会提及他的名字。” \n 莫雷尔犹豫了一会儿。对方是他暗中的仇敌，如果他用热情的态度向他招呼，这未免太虚伪了；但他又想起他的诺言和眼前的形势，他勉强掩饰住他的情绪，向弗兰兹鞠了一躬。 \n “维尔福小姐很悲伤吧，是不是？”德布雷问弗兰兹说。 \n “悲伤极了，”他答道，“今天早晨她的脸色非常的苍白，我简直认不出她了。” \n 这几句表面上很简单的话刺痛了莫雷尔的心。那么这个人见过瓦朗蒂娜，而且还和她说过话！这位高傲的年轻军官用了他的全部意志力才阻止了破坏自己的诺言。他挽起夏多·勒诺的胳膊向坟墓走去，送丧的人已经把那两具棺材抬进墓室里面去了。 \n “这个‘住处’很富丽堂皇，”波尚望着那座大坟说，“这是一座冬夏兼宜的宫殿。将来，到适当的时候，你也是要进去的，我亲爱的伊皮奈，因为你不久就要成为那个家庭的一员了。而我，象一个哲学家，喜欢有一间小小的乡下房子，在那些树底下盖一间茅庐，我不愿意在我自己的身体上面压上这么许多大石头。临死的时候，我要把伏尔泰写给庇隆［庇隆（一六八九—一七七三），法国诗人和剧作家。——译注］的那句话，‘到乡下去吧，一了百了。’说给我周围的人听。不过别去考虑这些，弗兰兹，横竖继承财产的是你的太太。” \n “波尚，”弗兰兹说，“你这个人真叫人受不了。政治使你对一切都采取嘲笑的态度，而操纵这些事务的人都有什么都不相信的习惯。当你有幸和普通人在一起，并且有幸能暂时离开政治的时候，设法去找回你那颗友爱的心吧，你在到众议院或贵族院去的时候，大概把它和你的手杖一同丢什么地方了。” \n “哦！我的上帝！”波尚说，“生命是什么？是在通向死神的候见室里短暂的停留。” \n “我讨厌波尚。”阿尔贝说，说着就拉着弗兰兹走开了，让波尚去和德布雷讲完他那篇看破红尘的议论。 \n 维尔福的家墓由白色的大理石筑成，是一座正方形的建筑物，高约二十呎，内部是隔开的，分别属于圣·梅朗和维尔福两个家庭，每一间都有一扇门同外面相通。有些人家的坟墓象是那种下等的五斗柜，墓穴象抽屉似的堆叠着。每一隔墓穴的前面刻上几行字，活象是一张铭牌。但维尔福的家墓却不然，从那青铜的墓门里望进去，先看见一间肃穆的前厅，墓室和前庭之间还隔了一堵墙，一扇门通入维尔福家的墓穴，一扇门通圣·梅朗家的墓穴。在那里面，他们可以尽情宣泄悲哀，即使有无聊的游客到拉雪兹神父墓地来举行野餐，即使情人们来这儿幽会，也不会打扰他们。 \n 两具棺材抬进了右边的墓室，放在事先准备好的抬架上，只有维尔福、弗兰兹和少数几个近亲进入那个墓穴。 \n 宗教的仪式都已在墓前举行，而且也没有举行什么演讲，所以送葬的人群很快就散了开；夏多·勒诺、阿尔贝和莫雷尔走一条路，德布雷和波尚走另外一条路。弗兰兹和维尔福先生在坟场门口等着莫雷尔借口逗留了一会儿，他看到弗兰兹和维尔福先生一同走进一辆马车，心里就觉得他们将进行一场密谈对他来说这是一个不祥的预兆。在回巴黎去的道路上而虽然与夏多·勒诺和阿尔贝同坐在一车马车里，但他们一路谈了些什么他却不知道。 \n 当弗兰兹快向维尔福先生告辞的时候，维尔福说：“我什么时候可以再见到您？” \n “随便您什么时候都可以，阁下。”弗兰兹回答。 \n “愈早愈好。” \n “我悉听您吩咐，阁下。我们一起回去好吗？” \n “如果那不会扰乱您的计划的话。” \n “绝对不会。” \n 于是这一对未来的翁婿就跨进同一辆马车，莫雷尔看着他们经过，心里非常烦燥、这种烦躁是有理由的。维尔福和弗兰兹回到圣·奥诺路。检察官不去看他的妻子和女儿，急急地走进他的书房，让年轻人坐在椅子上。“伊皮奈先生，”他说，“允许我提醒你，虽然乍一看也许会觉得现在这个时间选择得非常不合适，但我们是应该服从死者的旨意。圣·梅朗夫人在她的灵床上所表示的旨意，就是，瓦朗蒂娜的婚事不要耽搁。您知道，死者的一切事务都已办理得井井有条，在她的遗嘱里，她把圣·梅朗家的全部财产都留给了瓦朗蒂娜；律师昨天把那些文件给我看过了，我们可以凭此详详细细地草拟婚约。公证人就是圣·奥诺路波伏广场的狄思康先生。” \n “阁下，”伊皮奈先生答道，“瓦朗蒂娜小姐现在正非常悲痛，也许她还没有想到出嫁的事情，真的，我担心——” \n “瓦朗蒂娜最愉快的事情，”维尔福先生插进来说，“莫过于完成她外婆的遗训，那方面不会有什么阻碍，我向您保证。” \n “既然如此，”弗兰兹答道，“我这一方面也不会有什么阻碍，时间尽可以随您安排，这件事情我已经答应过，我很高兴能履行我自己的诺言。” \n “那么，”维尔福说，“一切都准备好了，婚约本来在三天以前就可以签订。不用再等了，我们今天就可以签订婚约。 \n “但现在是在服丧期呀！”弗兰兹迟疑地说。 \n “请放心，”维尔福回答。“舍下对于礼制决不会疏忽。在那三个月服丧期里，维尔福小姐可以到圣·梅朗去，住在她的庄园里，我说‘她的庄园’，因为那处产业已经属于她了。 \n 在一个星期之内，如果您愿意的话，就可以在那儿成婚，我们不铺张，也不请客。圣·梅朗夫人希望她的外孙女儿在那里结婚。婚礼完毕以后，阁下，您就可以回到巴黎来，而您的妻子则由她的继母陪她一同度过她的服丧期。” \n “就按您的意见吧，阁下。”弗兰兹说。 \n “那么，”维尔福先生答道，“请稍候，半小时以后，瓦朗蒂娜就可以到客厅里来。我派人去请狄思康先生，我们在分手以前先把婚约读一遍，签字以后，今天晚上维尔福夫人就陪瓦朗蒂娜到她的庄园去，我们在一星期之内去那儿，给你们完婚。” \n “阁下，”弗兰兹说，“我有一点请求。” \n “什么请求？” \n “我希望阿尔贝·马尔塞夫和莱罗尔·夏多·勒诺能参加这次的签约仪式，您知道他们是我的证人。” \n “半个钟头的时间已尽够通知他们了，您亲自去找他们还是派人去？” \n “我愿意自己走一趟，阁下。” \n “那么我希望您在半小时内回来，男爵，瓦朗蒂娜那时也可以准备好了。” \n 弗兰兹鞠了一躬，走了出去。房门刚关上，维尔福先生就派人去叫瓦朗蒂娜，要她在半小时内到客厅去，他希望公证人、伊皮奈先生和他的证人也能在那个时间以内赶到。这个消息顿时轰动了全家，维尔福夫人不肯相信，瓦朗蒂娜犹如遭了雷击，她回下张望寻找救兵。她本来想下楼去找她的祖父，但她在楼梯上遇到维尔福先生，维尔福挽住她的胳膊，把领她到客厅里去。在候见室里，瓦朗蒂娜遇到巴罗斯，她绝望地望着那个老仆人。一会儿，维尔福夫人带着小爱德华进客厅来了。她显然也分尝了家庭的悲哀，她的脸色苍白，看上去很疲倦。她坐下来，把爱德华抱在膝头上，不时痉挛地把这个孩子紧抱在她的胸前，似乎她的整个生命都已集中在儿子身上了。不久，他们听到有两辆马车驶进前庭。一辆是公证人的，一辆则载着弗兰兹和他的朋友。这会儿，人都到齐了，瓦朗蒂娜的脸色苍白，浅蓝色太阳穴上的青筋隐约可见，不仅环绕了她的眼圈，而且延伸到了她的脸颊，弗兰兹也深深被感动了。夏多·勒诺和阿尔贝互相惊愕地望着对方；刚才结束的葬礼似乎并不比快要开始的这一场更凄惨。维尔福夫人坐在一幅天鹅绒帷幕的阴影里，而且因为她一直俯身朝向坐在膝上的孩子，所以从她脸上的表情很难看她在想什么。维尔福先生跟平常一样，毫不动容。 \n 公证人按照惯例，把文件摆在桌子上，在一张圈椅里坐下来，举起他的单眼镜，转向弗兰兹。“您是不是弗兰兹·奎斯奈尔先生，伊皮奈男爵？”他问道，尽管他知道而且知道得十分清楚。 \n “是的，阁下。”弗兰兹回答。 \n 公证人欠了欠身。“那么，阁下，我应维尔福先生的请求，得通知您一声：您和维尔福小姐的婚事，改变了诺瓦蒂埃先生对他孙女儿的情感，已把他本来预备遗赠给她的财产进行了让与。但我有必要补充，现在既已全部赠让，所以那份遗嘱在法律上可以宣判无效。” \n “是的，”维尔福说，“但我要提醒伊皮奈先生，在我在世的期间，家父的遗嘱是不能更改。因为我的地位绝对不容许招惹一丝谗谤。” \n “阁下，”弗兰兹说，“这样的一个问题竟当着瓦朗蒂娜小姐的面提出，我深表遗憾，我从来没有问过她的财产数目，而且不论她的财产多少，总要比我的多。我以能和维尔福先生联姻为幸，我所寻求的只是幸福。” \n 瓦朗蒂娜暗地里很感谢他，两滴眼泪无声地滚下她的脸颊。 \n “而且，阁下，”维尔福对他的未来女婿说，“您除了在这方面受了一部分损失以外，这一份出人意料的遗嘱对您个人并没什么恶意，这完全是诺瓦蒂埃先生脑力不济的缘故。他所不高兴的，并不是因为瓦朗蒂娜小姐要嫁给您，而是因为她要嫁人，不论她嫁给哪一个人，他都会同样伤心的。老年人是自私的，阁下，维尔福小姐一向是诺瓦蒂埃先生忠实的侣伴，当她成为伊皮奈男爵夫人的时候，就不能再时时陪他了。家父的处境很不幸，由于他的脑力不济，理解力贫乏，所以许多事情我们无法和他谈，我确信在目前这个时候，虽然诺瓦蒂埃先生知道他的孙女快要结婚，但她一定把他未来孙女婿的名字都忘记了。” \n 维尔福先生说完这篇话，弗兰兹鞠了一躬，但他的话还没有出口，房门忽然打开，巴罗斯出现了。“诸位，”他说，他的语气异常坚决，在这种情况下，他不象是一个仆人在对他的主人说话——“诸位，诺瓦蒂埃先生希望立刻和弗兰兹·奎斯奈尔先生、伊皮奈男爵谈一次话。”他也象公证人一样，为避免找错了人，把入选的新郎的全部头衔都背了出来。 \n 维尔福吃了一惊，维尔福夫人让她的儿子从他的膝头上溜下来。瓦朗蒂娜站起身来，脸色苍白，哑口无言，象是一尊石像。阿尔贝和夏多·勒诺互相对望着，比第一次更惊愕。 \n 公证人也呆望着维尔福。 \n “这是不可能的，”检察官说，“这个时候伊皮奈男爵不能离开客厅。” \n “我的主人诺瓦蒂埃先生就是在这个时候希望和弗兰兹·伊皮奈先生谈一件重要的事情。”巴罗斯用同样坚决的语气回答。 \n “那么，诺瓦蒂埃爷爷现在能够讲话啦。”爱德华说，还是象往常那样肆无忌惮。可是，就连维尔福夫人听到他这句话都没有笑一下，每一个人的脑子里都杂乱无章，客厅里的气氛变得异常严肃。 \n “对诺瓦蒂埃先生说，”维尔福说，“他的要求无法满足。” \n “那么诺瓦蒂埃先生向这几位先生宣布，”巴罗斯说，“他要叫人抬他到客厅里来。” \n 大家惊讶到了极点。维尔福夫人的脸上露出一丝难以觉察的微笑。瓦朗蒂娜本能地抬起头来，看着天花板，心里在感谢上帝。 \n “你去看一看，瓦朗蒂娜，”维尔福先生说，“去看看你的祖父这次又有什么新花样。”瓦朗蒂娜急忙向门口走去。但维尔福先生忽然又改变主意。 \n “等一下！”他说，“我和你一起去。” \n “原谅我，阁下，”弗兰兹说，“据我看，既然诺瓦蒂埃先生派人来找我，就应该由我满足他的要求。而且，我还没有拜见过他，我很高兴能向他表达我的敬意。” \n “阁下，”维尔福说，态度显然很不安，“请不必劳驾。” \n “宽恕我，阁下，”弗兰兹用一种坚决的口气说。“我很想向诺瓦蒂埃先生证明，他对我的反感是大错特错的，而且不论他对我的成见有多深，我决心要用我恳挚的情意来打消它，所以我不愿意丧失这个解释的机会。”他不理会维尔福的话，站起来跟着瓦朗蒂娜走了出去；瓦朗蒂娜飞也似地跑下楼梯，高兴得象一个落海的水手发现了一块可以攀附的岩石一样。 \n 维尔福先生跟在他们的后面。夏多·勒诺和马尔塞夫又一次交换眼光，愈来愈感到莫名其妙了。 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/72/3992.html","bookId":545,"book":{"id":545,"title":"The Count of Monte
