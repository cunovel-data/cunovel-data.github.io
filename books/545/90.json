{"id":43958,"no":90,"title":"Chapter 96 The Contract","content":"THREE DAYS after the scene we have just described, namely towards five o\u0027clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti,--whom the banker persisted in calling prince,--a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the Count of Monte Cristo\u0027s house, and the count was preparing to go out. While his horses were impatiently pawing the ground,--held in by the coachman, who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box,--the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance-gate, and cast out on the doorsteps M. Andrea Cavalcanti, as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess. He inquired after the count with his usual familiarity, and ascending lightly to the second story met him at the top of the stairs. The count stopped on seeing the young man. As for Andrea, he was launched, and when he was once launched nothing stopped him. \"Ah, good morning, my dear count,\" said he. \"Ah, M. Andrea,\" said the latter, with his half-jesting tone; \"how do you do.\" \\n\\n \"Charmingly, as you see. I am come to talk to you about a thousand things; but, first tell me, were you going out or just returned?\" \\n\\n \"I was going out, sir.\" \\n\\n \"Then, in order not to hinder you, I will get up with you if you please in your carriage, and Tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow.\" \\n\\n \"No,\" said the count, with an imperceptible smile of contempt, for he had no wish to be seen in the young man\u0027s society,--\"no; I prefer listening to you here, my dear M. Andrea; we can chat better in-doors, and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation.\" The count returned to a small drawing-room on the first floor, sat down, and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also. Andrea assumed his gayest manner. \"You know, my dear count,\" said he, \"the ceremony is to take place this evening. At nine o\u0027clock the contract is to be signed at my father-in-law\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \"Ah, indeed?\" said Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"What; is it news to you? Has not M. Danglars informed you of the ceremony?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" said the count; \"I received a letter from him yesterday, but I do not think the hour was mentioned.\" \\n\\n \"Possibly my father-in-law trusted to its general notoriety.\" \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Monte Cristo, \"you are fortunate, M. Cavalcanti; it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting, and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome girl.\" \\n\\n \"Yes, indeed she is,\" replied Cavalcanti, in a very modest tone. \\n\\n \"Above all, she is very rich,--at least, I believe so,\" said Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"Very rich, do you think?\" replied the young man. \\n\\n \"Doubtless; it is said M. Danglars conceals at least half of his fortune.\" \\n\\n \"And he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions,\" said Andrea with a look sparkling with joy. \\n\\n \"Without reckoning,\" added Monte Cristo, \"that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United States and in England, but quite novel in France.\" \\n\\n \"Yes, yes, I know what you mean,--the railway, of which he has obtained the grant, is it not?\" \\n\\n \"Precisely; it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair.\" \\n\\n \"Ten millions! Do you think so? It is magnificent!\" said Cavalcanti, who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words. \"Without reckoning,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"that all his fortune will come to you, and justly too, since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only daughter. Besides, your own fortune, as your father assured me, is almost equal to that of your betrothed. But enough of money matters. Do you know, M. Andrea, I think you have managed this affair rather skilfully?\" \\n\\n \"Not badly, by any means,\" said the young man; \"I was born for a diplomatist.\" \\n\\n \"Well, you must become a diplomatist; diplomacy, you know, is something that is not to be acquired; it is instinctive. Have you lost your heart?\" \\n\\n \"Indeed, I fear it,\" replied Andrea, in the tone in which he had heard Dorante or Valere reply to Alceste* at the Theatre Fran?ais. \\n\\n \"Is your love returned?\" \\n\\n * In Molière\u0027s comedy, Le Misanthrope. \\n\\n \"I suppose so,\" said Andrea with a triumphant smile, \"since I am accepted. But I must not forget one grand point.\" \\n\\n \"Which?\" \\n\\n \"That I have been singularly assisted.\" \\n\\n \"Nonsense.\" \\n\\n \"I have, indeed.\" \\n\\n \"By circumstances?\" \\n\\n \"No; by you.\" \\n\\n \"By me? Not at all, prince,\" said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress on the title, \"what have I done for you? Are not your name, your social position, and your merit sufficient?\" \\n\\n \"No,\" said Andrea,--\"no; it is useless for you to say so, count. I maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name, my social position, and my merit.\" \\n\\n \"You are completely mistaken, sir,\" said Monte Cristo coldly, who felt the perfidious manoeuvre of the young man, and understood the bearing of his words; \"you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained; for, after all, who procured for me, who had never seen either you or your illustrious father, the pleasure of your acquaintance?--two of my good friends, Lord Wilmore and the Abbé Busoni. What encouraged me not to become your surety, but to patronize you?--your father\u0027s name, so well known in Italy and so highly honored. Personally, I do not know you.\" This calm tone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was, for the moment, restrained by a more muscular hand than his own, and that the restraint could not be easily broken through. \\n\\n \"Oh, then my father has really a very large fortune, count?\" \\n\\n \"It appears so, sir,\" replied Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?\" \\n\\n \"I have been advised of it.\" \\n\\n \"But the three millions?\" \\n\\n \"The three millions are probably on the road.\" \\n\\n \"Then I shall really have them?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, well,\" said the count, \"I do not think you have yet known the want of money.\" Andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment. Then, arousing from his revery,--\"Now, sir, I have one request to make to you, which you will understand, even if it should be disagreeable to you.\" \\n\\n \"Proceed,\" said Monte Cristo. \\n\\n \"I have formed an acquaintance, thanks to my good fortune, with many noted persons, and have, at least for the moment, a crowd of friends. But marrying, as I am about to do, before all Paris, I ought to be supported by an illustrious name, and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar; now, my father is not coming to Paris, is he? He is old, covered with wounds, and suffers dreadfully, he says, in travelling.\" \\n\\n \"Indeed?\" \\n\\n \"Well, I am come to ask a favor of you.\" \\n\\n \"Of me?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, of you.\" \\n\\n \"And pray what may it be?\" \\n\\n \"Well, to take his part.\" \\n\\n \"Ah, my dear sir! What?--after the varied relations I have had the happiness to sustain towards you, can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing? Ask me to lend you half a million and, although such a loan is somewhat rare, on my honor, you would annoy me less! Know, then, what I thought I had already told you, that in participation in this world\u0027s affairs, more especially in their moral aspects, the Count of Monte Cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the East. I, who have a seraglio at Cairo, one at Smyrna, and one at Constantinople, preside at a wedding?--never!\" \\n\\n \"Then you refuse me?\" \\n\\n \"Decidedly; and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the same way.\" \\n\\n \"But what must be done?\" said Andrea, disappointed. \\n\\n \"You said just now that you had a hundred friends.\" \\n\\n \"Very true, but you introduced me at M. Danglars\u0027.\" \\n\\n \"Not at all! Let us recall the exact facts. You met him at a dinner party at my house, and you introduced yourself at his house; that is a totally different affair.\" \\n\\n \"Yes, but, by my marriage, you have forwarded that.\" \\n\\n \"I?--not in the least, I beg you to believe. Recollect what I told you when you asked me to propose you. \u0027Oh, I never make matches, my dear prince, it is my settled principle.\u0027\" Andrea bit his lips. \\n\\n \"But, at least, you will be there?\" \\n\\n \"Will all Paris be there?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, certainly.\" \\n\\n \"Well, like all Paris, I shall be there too,\" said the count. \\n\\n \"And will you sign the contract?\" \\n\\n \"I see no objection to that; my scruples do not go thus far.\" \\n\\n \"Well, since you will grant me no more, I must be content with what you give me. But one word more, count.\" \\n\\n \"What is it?\" \\n\\n \"Advice.\" \\n\\n \"Be careful; advice is worse than a service.\" \\n\\n \"Oh, you can give me this without compromising yourself.\" \\n\\n \"Tell me what it is.\" \\n\\n \"Is my wife\u0027s fortune five hundred thousand livres?\" \\n\\n \"That is the sum M. Danglars himself announced.\" \\n\\n \"Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?\" \\n\\n \"This is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly: Your two solicitors appoint a meeting, when the contract is signed, for the next or the following day; then they exchange the two portions, for which they each give a receipt; then, when the marriage is celebrated, they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance.\" \\n\\n \"Because,\" said Andrea, with a certain ill-concealed uneasiness, \"I thought I heard my father-in-law say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now.\" \\n\\n \"Well,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"it will be the way, everybody says, of trebling your fortune in twelve months. Baron Danglars is a good father, and knows how to calculate.\" \\n\\n \"In that case,\" said Andrea, \"everything is all right, excepting your refusal, which quite grieves me.\" \\n\\n \"You must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances.\" \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Andrea, \"let it be as you wish. This evening, then, at nine o\u0027clock.\" \\n\\n \"Adieu till then.\" Notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of Monte Cristo, whose lips turned pale, but who preserved his ceremonious smile, Andrea seized the count\u0027s hand, pressed it, jumped into his phaeton, and disappeared. \\n\\n The four or five remaining hours before nine o\u0027clock arrived, Andrea employed in riding, paying visits,--designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker\u0027s in their gayest equipages,--dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain, and in which Danglars was just taking the initiative. In fact, at half-past eight in the evening the grand salon, the gallery adjoining, and the three other drawing-rooms on the same floor, were filled with a perfumed crowd, who sympathized but little in the event, but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen. An Academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies, famished bees, and buzzing drones. \\n\\n No one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated; the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings; and all the bad taste of decorations, which had only their richness to boast of, shone in its splendor. Mademoiselle Eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress, and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament, unaccompanied by a single jewel. Her eyes, however, betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire. Madame Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray, Beauchamp, and Chateau-Renaud. \\n\\n Debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony, but on the same plane with every one else, and without any particular privilege. M. Danglars, surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue, was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry. Andrea, on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera, was explaining to him rather cleverly, since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease, his future projects, and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to Parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy-five thousand livres per annum. \\n\\n The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises, rubies, emeralds, opals, and diamonds. As usual, the oldest women were the most decorated, and the ugliest the most conspicuous. If there was a beautiful lily, or a sweet rose, you had to search for it, concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban, or an aunt with a bird of paradise. \\n\\n At each moment, in the midst of the crowd, the buzzing, and the laughter, the door-keeper\u0027s voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department, respected in the army, or illustrious in the literary world, and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups. But for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves, how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain! At the moment when the hand of the massive time-piece, representing Endymion asleep, pointed to nine on its golden face, and the hammer, the faithful type of mechanical thought, struck nine times, the name of the Count of Monte Cristo resounded in its turn, and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door. \\n\\n The count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity; his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face. His only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat. A circle was immediately formed around the door. The count perceived at one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawing-room, M. Danglars at the other, and Eugénie in front of him. He first advanced towards the baroness, who was chatting with Madame de Villefort, who had come alone, Valentine being still an invalid; and without turning aside, so clear was the road left for him, he passed from the baroness to Eugénie, whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms, that the proud artist was quite struck. Near her was Mademoiselle Louise d\u0027Armilly, who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for Italy, which she intended immediately to make use of. On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars, who had advanced to meet him. \\n\\n Having accomplished these three social duties, Monte Cristo stopped, looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class, which seems to say, \"I have done my duty, now let others do theirs.\" Andrea, who was in an adjoining room, had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of Monte Cristo, and now came forward to pay his respects to the count. He found him completely surrounded; all were eager to speak to him, as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty. The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature; it was a gilt table supported on lions\u0027 claws. One of the notaries sat down, the other remained standing. They were about to proceed to the reading of the contract, which half Paris assembled was to sign. All took their places, or rather the ladies formed a circle, while the gentlemen (more indifferent to the restraints of what Boileau calls the \"energetic style\") commented on the feverish agitation of Andrea, on M. Danglars\u0027 riveted attention, Eugénie\u0027s composure, and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair. \\n\\n The contract was read during a profound silence. But as soon as it was finished, the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing-rooms; the brilliant sums, the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people, and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young lady\u0027s diamonds, which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose, had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly. Mademoiselle Danglars\u0027 charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men, and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor. As for the ladies, it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions, they thought they did not need them for themselves, as they were beautiful enough without them. Andrea, surrounded by his friends, complimented, flattered, beginning to believe in the reality of his dream, was almost bewildered. The notary solemnly took the pen, flourished it above his head, and said, \"Gentlemen, we are about to sign the contract.\" \\n\\n The baron was to sign first, then the representative of M. Cavalcanti, senior, then the baroness, afterwards the \"future couple,\" as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents. The baron took the pen and signed, then the representative. The baroness approached, leaning on Madame de Villefort\u0027s arm. \"My dear,\" said she, as she took the pen, \"is it not vexatious? An unexpected incident, in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of Monte Cristo\u0027s, in which he nearly fell a victim, deprives us of the pleasure of seeing M. de Villefort.\" \\n\\n \"Indeed?\" said M. Danglars, in the same tone in which he would have said, \"Oh, well, what do I care?\" \\n\\n \"As a matter of fact,\" said Monte Cristo, approaching, \"I am much afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his absence.\" \\n\\n \"What, you, count?\" said Madame Danglars, signing; \"if you are, take care, for I shall never forgive you.\" Andrea pricked up his ears. \\n\\n \"But it is not my fault, as I shall endeavor to prove.\" Every one listened eagerly; Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips, was about to speak. \"You remember,\" said the count, during the most profound silence, \"that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house; the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice, on attempting to leave it.\" \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Danglars. \\n\\n \"In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed, and his clothes were thrown into a corner, where the police picked them up, with the exception of the waistcoat, which they overlooked.\" Andrea turned pale, and drew towards the door; he saw a cloud rising in the horizon, which appeared to forebode a coming storm. \\n\\n \"Well, this waistcoat was discovered to-day, covered with blood, and with a hole over the heart.\" The ladies screamed, and two or three prepared to faint. \"It was brought to me. No one could guess what the dirty rag could be; I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man. My valet, in examining this mournful relic, felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out; it was a letter addressed to you, baron.\" \\n\\n \"To me?\" cried Danglars. \\n\\n \"Yes, indeed, to you; I succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained,\" replied Monte Cristo, amid the general outburst of amazement. \\n\\n \"But,\" asked Madame Danglars, looking at her husband with uneasiness, \"how could that prevent M. de Villefort\"-- \\n\\n \"In this simple way, madame,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence; I therefore sent them to the king\u0027s attorney. You understand, my dear baron, that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was, perhaps, some plot against you.\" Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo and disappeared in the second drawing-room. \\n\\n \"Possibly,\" said Danglars; \"was not this murdered man an old galley-slave?\" \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied the count; \"a felon named Caderousse.\" Danglars turned slightly pale; Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing-room. \\n\\n \"But go on signing,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I perceive that my story has caused a general emotion, and I beg to apologize to you, baroness, and to Mademoiselle Danglars.\" The baroness, who had signed, returned the pen to the notary. \"Prince Cavalcanti,\" said the latter; \"Prince Cavalcanti, where are you?\" \\n\\n \"Andrea, Andrea,\" repeated several young people, who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name. \\n\\n \"Call the prince; inform him that it is his turn to sign,\" cried Danglars to one of the floorkeepers. \\n\\n But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments, quaerens quem devoret. There was, indeed, reason to retreat, to be alarmed, and to scream. An officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing-room, and was advancing towards Danglars, preceded by a commissary of police, girded with his scarf. Madame Danglars uttered a scream and fainted. Danglars, who thought himself threatened (certain consciences are never calm),--Danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror. \\n\\n \"What is the matter, sir?\" asked Monte Cristo, advancing to meet the commissioner. \\n\\n \"Which of you gentlemen,\" asked the magistrate, without replying to the count, \"answers to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti?\" A cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room. They searched; they questioned. \"But who then is Andrea Cavalcanti?\" asked Danglars in amazement. \\n\\n \"A galley-slave, escaped from confinement at Toulon.\" \\n\\n \"And what crime has he committed?\" \\n\\n 在我们上文讲述过的那幕场面发生后的三天，——也就是说，在欧热妮·腾格拉尔小姐和被那位银行家坚持称为王子的安德烈·卡瓦尔康蒂将要和腾格拉尔签订婚约的那天下午五点钟左右，——一阵清新的微风吹过了基督山伯爵屋前的小花园，伯爵正准备出去，他的马在焦躁不安地踢着地面，车夫在控制着马，他已经在他的座位上等了一刻钟了。正当这时，我们所熟悉的那辆漂亮的轻便马车已经来到了大门口。 \\n\\n 那打扮得十分整齐，高兴得象快要去娶一位公主为妻的安德烈·卡瓦尔康蒂先生走下车来。他照常用熟悉的口气问一问伯爵是否在家，然后轻捷地蹿上二楼，在楼梯顶上遇到了伯爵。伯爵一看见那青年就停住了脚步。至于安德烈，他正在往前冲，当他一旦往前冲的时候，是什么都挡不住他的。“啊，早安，我亲爱的伯爵。”他说。 \\n\\n “啊，安德烈先生！”伯爵用他那种半带戏弄的口气说，“您好吗？” \\n\\n “好得很，这是您可以看得出来的，我有许多许多事情得跟您谈。您是刚回来？” \\n\\n “我正要出去，阁下。” \\n\\n “那末，为了不耽误您的时间，我可以跟您一起去，我坐在您的车子里，叫汤姆驾着我的轻便马车并排跟着。” \\n\\n “不，”伯爵说，脸上露出一个难以觉察的轻蔑的微笑，因为他并不想让人看见他和这个青年人在一起，——“不，我情愿在这儿跟您谈，我亲爱的安德烈先生。我们在屋子里谈话会更好些，这儿没有车夫来窃听我们的谈话。” \\n\\n 伯爵回到二楼的一间小客厅里，坐下来，跷起腿，示意那个青年人也坐下来。安德烈拿出他最高兴的态度。“您知道，我亲爱的伯爵，”他说，“我今天晚上要订婚了。九点钟在我岳父家里签约。” \\n\\n “呀！真的？”基督山说。 \\n\\n “什么！您把它当作新闻吗？腾格拉尔先生难道没有把这个消息告诉您吗？” \\n\\n “噢，告诉我了，”伯爵说，“我昨天收到他的一封信，但我没有记清具体的时间。” \\n\\n “可能的，我的岳父大概以为这件事大家都知道的了。” \\n\\n “嗯，”基督山说，“您很幸运，卡瓦尔康蒂先生，这是一个最门当户对的婚姻了，再说，腾格拉尔小姐又很漂亮。” \\n\\n “是的，她的确很漂亮。”卡瓦尔康蒂用谦虚的口气说。 \\n\\n “尤其是，她非常有钱，——至少，我相信是如此。”基督山说。 \\n\\n “非常有钱，您以为是吗？”那青年回答。 \\n\\n “当然罗，据说腾格拉尔先生至少隐瞒了他的一半财产。” \\n\\n “而他自己说有一千五百万至二千万。”安德烈说，他的眼睛里闪耀着喜悦的火花。 \\n\\n “而且，”基督山又说，“他很快又要开始一种新的投机事业了，这种副业在英美已很流行，但在法国却还很新奇。” \\n\\n “是的，是的，我知道您所指的是什么，是铁路，对不对？他已获得了铁路的承股权。” \\n\\n “一点不错，大家都相信他在那件事情上可以赚到一千万。” \\n\\n “一千万？您这样想吗？真是太有意思了。”卡瓦尔康蒂说，他被这些无懈可击的花言巧语冲昏了头脑。 \\n\\n “而且，”基督山继续说，“他的全部财产将来都要归您，这是天经地义的事，因为腾格拉尔小姐是一位独生女儿。再说，您自己的财产，令尊告诉我的，几乎也和您的未婚妻一样多。现在先把钱的事稍为搁一搁吧。您知道吗，安德烈先生，我以为您这件事情办得巧妙。” \\n\\n “至少还不算太坏，”那青年说，“我天生是一个外交家。” \\n\\n “嗯，您一定要成为一位外交家，外交辞令，您知道，不是学得的，——它是一种本能。这么说，您的心已被征服了吗？” \\n\\n “真的，我想是的。”安德烈模仿法兰西戏院里杜郎特或梵丽丽回答阿尔西斯提回时那种腔调说道。 \\n\\n “她也有些喜欢您吗？” \\n\\n “我想是的，”安德烈带着一个得意的微笑说，“因为我已经被她接受了。但我不能忘记很重要的一点。” \\n\\n “那是什么？” \\n\\n “就是我曾得到过奇怪的帮助。” \\n\\n “瞎说。” \\n\\n “真是的。” \\n\\n “是环境帮助了您！” \\n\\n “不，是您。” \\n\\n “我？决不是的，王子，”基督山说，并故意加重说了那个头衔，“我对您有什么帮助？单凭您的名望，您的社会地位和您的品貌，就已经足够了吗？” \\n\\n “不，”安德烈说，——“不，您那样说是没有用的，伯爵。我一直认为我的名望、我的社会地位和我的学问不及您的一分帮助。” \\n\\n “您完全弄错了，阁下，”基督山冷冷地说，他从青年的那种无赖态度上知道了他话里的意思，“您是在我了解了令尊的权利和财产情况以后才获得我的保护。我从来不曾见过您或您那显赫的父亲。归根结蒂究竟是谁使我有幸认识你们的呢？是我的两个好朋友，威玛勋爵和布沙尼神甫。究竟我为什么要成为您的——不是担保人，而是——保护人呢？那是因为令尊的名望，因为令尊在意大利无人不知，十分受人尊崇。从您个人来说，我可并不认识您。”这种平静的口气和十分安祥的态度使安德烈知道他这时已遭遇到一只比自己更有力的手，并且知道从那只手的压力下逃出来是不容易的。 \\n\\n “噢，那么家父真的有一笔非常大的财产吗，伯爵？” \\n\\n “看来是如此，阁下。”基督山回答。 \\n\\n “您知道家父答应我的结婚费用是否到了吗？” \\n\\n “令尊已通知过我。” \\n\\n “但那三百万现款呢？” \\n\\n “那三百万大概已经在路上了。” \\n\\n “那么我真能得到它吗？” \\n\\n “吓！”伯爵说，“我想您还不至于这么缺钱用吧。” \\n\\n 安德烈是这样的惊奇，好一会他不知道该说些什么。然后，他从迷糊状中醒来，说：“现在，阁下，我对您只有一项请求了，那件事，即使您不愿意，也一定能谅解我的。” \\n\\n “请说。”基督山说。 \\n\\n “因为我的好运，我已经结识了许多知名的人士，同时，至少在目前，还有着一群朋友。但是，既然我要在巴黎举行盛大的结婚典礼，就应该有一个鼎鼎大名的人来主持。如果父亲不在场，就应该有一位有地位的人领我到圣坛［欧洲风俗：在教堂里结婚，新郎新娘须在圣坛前受神父祝福。——译注］前面。现在家父看来是不能来巴黎了，是吗？” \\n\\n “他年岁已老，浑身满是伤疤，他说，每一次旅行都使他痛苦难捱。” \\n\\n “我明白。嗯，所以我来请您给我一个面子。” \\n\\n “什么请求？” \\n\\n “哦，就是代替他的位置。” \\n\\n “啊，我亲爱的先生！什么！在我有幸跟您作过那么多的接触以后，您竟还这样不明白我的为人，竟然来要求我做这样的一种事情？要我借五十万给您，老实说，虽然这样的借款是非常少见，但您也未必会让我如此为难。我记得我曾经告诉过您，在参与世事方面，——尤其是伦理道德方面的事情，——基督山伯爵从未参预忌讳的事，说得更明白一点，这是东方人的迷信。我在开罗士麦拿、君士坦丁堡都有藏娇的迷宫，可是我为人主持过一次婚礼吗？——绝对没有！” \\n\\n “那么您拒绝我了？” \\n\\n “坚决拒绝，即使您是我的儿子或我的兄弟，我也会同样拒绝您。” \\n\\n “那我该么办呢？”安德烈失望地说。 \\n\\n “您自己刚才不是说，您的朋友多得很。” \\n\\n “不错，但介绍我到腾格拉尔先生家里去的却是您。” \\n\\n “决不是的！让我们来回忆一下那个事实。您在我家里的一次宴会席上遇见他，您自己到他家里去拜访，那是一件与我毫无关系的事情。” \\n\\n “是的，关于我的婚姻，却是您促成的。” \\n\\n “我！丝毫不是，您记得的。请回忆一下当您要我为您去做媒的时候，我对您说了些什么。噢，我是决不会去为别人促成婚事的，我亲爱的王子，这是我坚定不移的原则。” \\n\\n 安德烈咬了咬他的嘴唇。“但至少，”他说，“您总会去参加的吧。” \\n\\n “全巴黎的人都去吗？” \\n\\n “噢，当然罗。” \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n “嗯，我跟全巴黎的人一样，我也会去的。”伯爵说。 \\n\\n “您会在婚约上签名吗？” \\n\\n “我看这一点没什么值得反对的，我还不至于忌讳到那种程度。” \\n\\n “好吧，既然您不肯给我面子，我也只能凭您给我的这点就满足了。但还有两个字，伯爵。” \\n\\n “是什么？” \\n\\n “忠告。” \\n\\n “请小心，忠告比效劳更坏。” \\n\\n “但您可以给我这个忠告而不会连累您自己。” \\n\\n “告诉我那是什么。” \\n\\n “我太太的财产有五十万里弗吗？” \\n\\n “那是腾格拉尔先生亲自告诉我的数目。” \\n\\n “我应该收下这笔款子呢，还是让它留在公证人的手里？” \\n\\n “这种事情通常总是按一定的惯例来办理的：在签订婚约的时候，你们男女双方的律师约好一个聚会的时间，或在第二天，或在第三天。然后，他们交换嫁资和聘金，各给一张收据。然后，在举行婚礼的时候他们把钱转到你们的名下，因为那时你是一家之主了。” \\n\\n “我这样问，是因为，”安德烈带着某种不加掩饰的不安说，“我好象听我的岳父说，他准备把我们的财产全投资在您刚才说过的那种赚钱的铁路事业上。” \\n\\n “嗯，”基督山答道，“每一个人都说那种投资可以使你的财产在十二月之内翻三倍。腾格拉尔男爵是一位好岳父，而且挺会算计的。” \\n\\n “嗯，那好，”安德烈说，“一切都好，只是您的拒绝使我很伤心。” \\n\\n “您只能把这点归罪于在某种情况下的非常自然的清规戒律。” \\n\\n “嗯，”安德烈说，“就说这些吧，那么今天晚上，九点钟。” \\n\\n “到时再见。” \\n\\n 安德烈抓起伯爵的手，紧紧地握了一下，跳进他的轻便马车里很快就驶远了。当握手的时候，基督山曾想抗拒，他的嘴唇苍白起来，但却仍保持着他那彬彬有礼的微笑。 \\n\\n 在九点以前的那四五个钟头里，安德烈乘着马车到处拜访，想结交那些曾在他岳父那儿会过的富豪们做朋友，把腾格拉尔快要开始投资的铁路股票的惊人利润向他们夸耀了一番。当晚八点半，那大客厅，与客厅相连的走廊，还有楼下的另外三间客厅里，都挤满了香气扑鼻的人群。这些人并不是为交情而来，而是被一种不可抗拒的欲望吸引来的，是想来看看有没有什么新鲜的事物。一位院士曾说：上流社会的宴会等于是名花的汇集，它会吸引轻浮的蝴蝶、饥饿的贪婪的蜜蜂和嗡嗡营营的雄蜂。 \\n\\n 各个房间里当然都灯火辉煌。墙壁镀金的嵌线上密密地排着灯火；那些除了夸富以外别无用处的家具大放光彩。欧热妮小姐的穿饰文雅朴素，穿看一件合身的白绸长袍。她唯一的装饰品是一朵半插在她那乌玉般黑的头发里的白玫瑰，并无任何一颗珠宝。她的打扮虽然显得纯洁高尚，她眼睛里却流露出一种与之相反的傲慢神气。在距她不远的地方，腾格拉尔夫人正在与德布雷、波尚和夏多·勒诺闲谈。德布雷被邀请来参加这次盛大的典礼，但象每一个人一样，他并没有得到任何特权。腾格拉尔先生正被包围在一群财政部官员和与财政部有关的人士中间，正在向他们解释一种新的税收原则，等到将来当形势迫使政府不得不邀他入部参与大计的时候再来实施。安德烈的手臂上挽着一个歌剧里那种洋味十足的花花公子，装出一种很随便的神气——但多少有点尴尬——向他解释将来的计划，描述凭着他那每年十七万五千里弗的收入，他将怎样向巴黎的时髦上层社会介绍新的奢侈品。 \\n\\n 人群拥来拥去，象是一道由蓝宝石、红宝石、翡翠、猫眼石和金刚石组成的涡流一样。象平常一样，年龄最老的女人打扮得最华丽，而最丑的女人最引人注目。假如当时有一颗美丽水仙花，或一朵甜的玫瑰，你得仔细搜索才能找到，因为她总是躲在一个角落里，或者藏在一个戴面巾的母亲或戴孔雀毛帽子的姑母后面的。 \\n\\n 在这喧哗笑闹的人群中，随时可以听到司仪的声音，通报一位金融巨头、军界要员或文学名士的姓名；那时，各个人群里便会随着那个姓名的喊声发一阵轻微的骚动。虽然你有权利可以在这儿激起人海的波浪，但多数人却只得到了漠视的一瞥或轻蔑的一笑！当金面大时钟上的时针指到九点，当机械的钟锤敲打了九下的时候，司仪报出了基督山伯爵的名字，象触了电一样，全场的人都把他们的视线转向了门口。基督山伯爵穿着黑衣服，象他往常一样的简单朴素。他唯一的装饰虽是一条极其精致的金链，挂在他白背心上让人难以觉察。伯爵一眼就看到了坐在客厅一端的腾格拉尔夫人，在客厅另一端的腾格拉尔先生，以及在他对面的欧热妮。他首先向男爵夫人走过去，男爵夫人这时正与维尔福夫人聊天（维尔福夫人是独自来的，因为瓦朗蒂娜依旧还不能走动）；然后，他从男爵夫人那儿一直走到——人群中间早已给他让出了一条路——欧热妮那儿，用非常急速而含蓄的话语向她道贺，使这位骄傲的女艺术家也不得不表示惊奇。亚密莱小姐就站在她的身边，她感谢伯爵这样慨然答应她给意大利剧院写封介绍信，并表示她立刻就要用到那封介绍信。离开了这些女太太们以后，基督山走近了腾格拉尔，因为腾格拉尔已向他迎上来。 \\n\\n 完成了这三项社交义务以后，基督山停下来，用充满自信的目光环顾四周，象是在说：“我已完成了我的责任，现在让旁人去完成他们的责任吧。”安德烈本来在隔壁房间里，这时也已感觉到基督山的到达所引起的骚动，起来向伯爵致意。 \\n\\n 他发现伯爵已被大家包围得水泄不通；大家都盼望与他讲话，这是一个不轻易说话而每次说话必有份量的人能经常遇到的事情。这时，双方的律师到了，他们把拟定好了的文件放在那张签字用的桌子上；那是一张描金的桌子，四条桌腿雕成狮爪形，桌面上铺着绣金的天鹅绒台毯。律师之中有一位坐下来，其余的都站着。他们快要宣读那份来参加这个典礼的半数巴黎人都要签字的婚约了。大家都在为自己找一个好的位置，太太小姐们围成一个圆圈，先生们则采取比较远的位置，评论着安德烈的紧张不安，腾格拉尔先生的全神贯注、欧热妮的从容自若以及男爵夫人在处理整个大厅这类重要事情时的雍容大度而又敏捷的态度。 \\n\\n 读婚约的时候四处鸦雀无声。但婚约一读完，那几间客厅里便更加喧闹起来；那即将属于未婚夫妇的几百万巨款，那些放在一个大房间里的礼物以及那位未来新娘的钻石，到处都充满了羡慕的声音。在青年男子的脸上，腾格拉尔小姐的可爱又增加了几倍，她光彩夺目。至于太太小姐们，不用说，她们当然嫉妒那几百万，但心里却以为她们自己的美丽可以不用金钱点缀。安德烈被他的朋友包围了起来，在一片道喜和赞美声中，他开始相信他的梦想已变成现实，简直飘飘然了。律师庄严地拿起笔，举过的头顶，说：“诸位，婚约开始签字了。” \\n\\n 按照仪式，第一个签字的是男爵；然后是老卡瓦尔康蒂先生的代表签字；然后是男爵夫人；男爵夫人之后，才是婚约上的所谓未婚夫妇。男爵接过笔来签了字，然后代表也签了字。男爵夫人扶着维尔福夫人的膀子走近来。“亲爱的，”她一面说，一面接过笔来，“这太令人恼火了？一件意想不到的事情，就是为了上次基督山伯爵几乎险遭不测的那件谋杀案和偷窃案，竟使我们不能让维尔福先生来这儿观礼。” \\n\\n “真的！”腾格拉尔说，他的口气象是在说，“哼，我根本不在乎！” \\n\\n “啊！”基督山走近来说，“我怕这件事情是我无意中造成的。” \\n\\n “什么！您，伯爵？”腾格拉尔夫人一面说，一面签字，“假如是您，可得小心，我可永远不能宽恕您的呀。”安德烈竖起他的耳朵。 \\n\\n “但那不是我的错，我应当努力来向您证明。” \\n\\n 每一个都在留心听着，平时极少说话的基督山快要说话了。 \\n\\n “您记得，”伯爵在一片寂静中开口说，“想来偷东西的那个刻毒的恶棍是死在我家里的，据当时推测，他是在企图离开我家里的时候被他的同谋犯刺死的。” \\n\\n “是的。”腾格拉尔说。 \\n\\n “嗯，为了检查他的伤口，他的衣服被脱了下来，扔在一个角落里，后来由法院方面的警官把它捡了回去，但他们却漏下了他的一件背心。” \\n\\n 安德烈脸色变得发白，向门口走过去；他看见天上忽然上升起了一朵乌云，似乎预示一场暴风雨即将来临。 \\n\\n “嗯！这件背心今天被我发现了，上面满是血迹，心口处有一个洞。”太太小姐失声尖叫起来，有两三个装出要晕倒的样子。“仆人拿那件背心给我看。准都猜不出那块弄脏的破东西是什么，只有我猜想到它是那个死者的背心。我的仆人在检查这阴森可怕的遗物的时候，摸到口袋里有一张纸，抽出来一看，原来是一封写给您的信，男爵。” \\n\\n “给我的！”腾格拉尔喊道。 \\n\\n “是的，的确写给您的，那封信虽然沾满了血迹，但我却从血迹底下辨认出您的名字。”基督山在一片惊讶声中回答道。 \\n\\n “但是，”腾格拉尔夫人恐惧不安地望着她的丈夫问道，“那件事怎么会阻止维尔福先生——” \\n\\n “非常简单，夫人，”基督山答道，“那件背心和那封信都是确凿的证据。所以我就把它们都送到检察官那儿去了。您知道，我亲爱的男爵，遇到案件，依法办理是最妥当的了，那也许是一种攻击您的阴谋。” \\n\\n 安德烈两眼直直望着基督山，偷偷溜进了隔壁的那间客厅里。 \\n\\n “可能的，”腾格拉尔说，“这个被杀的人不是一个苦役犯吗？” \\n\\n “是的，”伯爵答道，“是一个名叫卡德鲁斯的凶犯。” \\n\\n 腾格拉尔脸色微微变得苍白；安德烈离开第二间客厅，溜进候见室里。 \\n\\n “请继续签字吧，”基督山说，“我看我的故事让大家都惊呆啦，我向您、男爵夫人和腾格拉尔小姐表示歉意。” \\n\\n 男爵夫人这时已签过字，把笔交回给律师。“卡瓦尔康蒂王子！”后者说，“卡瓦尔康蒂王子，您在哪儿呀？” \\n\\n “安德烈！安德烈！”有几个青年人连连喊道，他们已够亲密到能称呼他的教名了。 \\n\\n “去叫王子来！通知他现在已经轮到他签字了！”腾格拉尔大声对一个司仪说。 \\n\\n 就在这时，大客厅里的宾客们忽然惊惶地向后退去，象是一个吓人的妖怪闯进屋来要吞食某一个人似的。他们的后退、惊惶和喊叫是有理由的。一个军官在客厅的每一个门口派了两个兵看守，他自己则跟在一个胸佩绶带的警官后面，向腾格拉尔走过来。腾格拉尔以为他们的对象就是他（有些人的良心是永远不安的），在他的宾客面前展露出一个恐怖的面孔。“什么事，阁下？”基督山迎上去问那个警官。 \\n\\n “诸位，”那位法官不回答伯爵，问道，“你们之中哪一位叫安德烈·卡瓦尔康蒂？” \\n\\n 房间里到处可以听到惊慌的喊叫声。他们四处搜寻，他们互相探问。 \\n\\n “安德烈·卡瓦尔康蒂究竟是什么人呀？”腾格拉尔在极度惊愕中问。 \\n\\n “是从土伦监狱里逃出来的苦役犯。” \\n\\n “他犯了什么罪？” \\n\\n “他被控，”那执事官用他冷漠的声音说，“杀害了那个名叫卡德鲁斯的人。那个人当初是跟他一条链上的同伴，被告在他从基督山伯爵家里逃出来的时候杀害了他。” \\n\\n 基督山向四周急速地瞥视了一眼。安德烈已经不见了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n
