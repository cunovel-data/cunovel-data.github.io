When he finally calls, he says he needs \"space.\" Furious, Sutton does what any jilted girl would doâ€”she gets over her last boyfriend by finding a new one. And luckily Garrett Austin is happy to step up and be her new leading man. The only catch: Garrett used to date Sutton\u0027s best friend Charlotte. Now an annoyed Charlotte is insisting that Sutton\u0027s younger sister, Laurel, be admitted to the Lying Game clique. If Sutton wants to keep Laurel out, she\u0027ll need to outdo her in a series of prank challenges. Defeating Laurel should be a no-brainer, but little sis has some tricks up her sleeve... Will Sutton prove she\u0027s the only Mercer fit for the club? Or is the Lying Game queen about to get overthrown by her not-so-loyal subjects?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/true-lies-the-lying-game-0.jpg","author":"Sara Shepard","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":13,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
