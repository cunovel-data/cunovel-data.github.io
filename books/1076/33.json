{"id":40924,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV WE OUTSTRIP OUR FORTUNE","content":"Next morning I packed a small valise and paid the landlord, telling him we were going on a shooting expedition to a district some twenty miles off, whence the time of our return might be uncertain. Then we set off for Carlzig. Our first business there was to buy a carriage and a pair of fast horses. This was not an easy matter, and it was some hours before we found just what we wanted. But at last we got hold of two good strong-winded animals and a serviceable light carriage, somewhat like an old-fashioned calèche, our pretext being that we intended them for a driving tour through the country. We then laid in a stock of provisions, bought another revolver each, with a good supply of cartridges, and having provided ourselves with the necessary tools for the removal of the bars, we were ready. We had an early dinner, and afterwards drove quietly out of the town. Strode, who was going to be coachman, had mounted the box, and I drove inside so as to avoid observation as much as possible. By an indirect route and at an easy pace we made our way to a spot we had settled upon, perhaps a quarter of a mile from the entrance to the underground passage. Here, in a wild piece of woodland approached by a rough grass road, the carriage [Pg 210]could stay with very little chance of attracting attention even from the Count’s spies. We had agreed that I should go through to the Monastery alone, for if the prisoner should be in the same room there would probably, unless we were interrupted, be no difficulty in my effecting her release single-handed; if, on the other hand, I could not find her, or any unexpected difficulty should arise, I was to hurry back for Strode. It was now dusk—almost dark. I put the tools in my pocket and hastened impatiently to the entrance of the passage. I had bought a small lantern in Carlzig, and with this protection for my light was able to make much quicker progress, especially as the way was now familiar. I reached the steps and trap-door; left my lantern at the bottom and passed through. Then, as I drew near, a horrible fear came upon me that a few steps would show me the disappointment to which I might be doomed. I scarcely dared approach the doorway where my worst fears might in an instant be confirmed. The momentary weakness was overcome and I peered out into the passage. To my intense joy and relief a faint glimmer of light fell across it at half its length. In a few seconds I was by the window. Approaching cautiously, I heard no sound of voices; the curtains were drawn slightly apart, I peeped through and saw Fr?ulein Asta sitting there alone. A tap on the glass brought her joyfully to the window. In reply to my sign of inquiry she nodded that all was safe, so without delay I set to work on the screws that held the bars. They had evidently been recently put in and yielded readily to the wrench. One after another the bars were turned down while the prisoner kept watch by the door. In a few minutes every obstacle was removed; I beckoned, and the Fr?ulein ran to the window and opened it. [Pg 211] \"Is all safe?\" were my first words. \"Yes,\" she answered. “I do not think Telka will return, and the Count”—she gave a little shudder—“is away. Oh, I have feared!” “And I too. But we will talk of that presently when you are safe. Quick, now; bring a chair. So. Now let me lift you through.” Her arms were round my neck, and I had little difficulty in drawing her through the open window. “So far good,” I said; “let me replace the bars to throw them off the track.” The delay was risky, but I judged it worth while to prevent the prisoner’s manner of escape from being too obvious. Pursuit would be certain in any case, and this precaution might gain us time. The bars were soon in position. “Now, Fr?ulein, quick! Let me hold your arm and guide you. The way is not easy.” I led her along the dark passage and so to the trap-door. “Once down here I trust we shall be safe,” I said, lifting it. The girl hesitated a moment—the descent was not inviting—then, holding my hand, crept down. I took up my lantern and went on in front, for there was no room for us to walk abreast. The dark, dripping, noisome gallery must have seemed horrible to the girl, but she kept bravely on at my heels, I guiding and encouraging her as best I could, considering how hurried our progress had to be. “We are nearly at the end now,” I was able at length to say, and then we began the ascent which brought us to the entrance. Bidding her stay a moment while I reconnoitred, I scrambled warily up till my head was just enough above ground to look about. All seemed safe, so pulling myself out of the hole, I lifted my companion after me, and we set off for the place where the carriage was waiting. [Pg 212] As we came in sight of Strode he waved his hand joyfully. “This is better than I dared to hope,” was his excited greeting. The girl gave him a grateful nod and smile—there was no time for words as we hurried into the carriage—the good fellow sprang up and set his horses going as fast as he dared down the bumpy lane. In ten minutes, however, the jolting ceased; we had struck the high road, along which we began to bolt at a rare pace. I now had time to notice that my companion was evidently feeling the unusual exertions and excitement she had just gone through. She lay back half-fainting. I hastily opened a flask of wine; this revived her. She was a plucky girl, and in a few minutes had so far recovered as to be able to laugh at her weakness and begin to chat. “I was in the Monastery again last night,” I said. “Again! Why did you come?” she asked. “I could not keep away. The feeling that you were in such danger was too strong for me, and I wanted, in case of accidents, to show Strode the way.” Perhaps she felt intuitively that there had been a more strongly impelling reason behind the others. Anyhow her look was more than grateful as she said: “It was rash of you to venture again. If I had known you were there I should have been terribly anxious. For they took me away to a distant part of the building.” “You know why?” “Rallenstein had come unexpectedly.” “I know.” “You know?” she cried in surprise. “Yes. I saw him.” [Pg 213] “Herr Tyrrell! What fearful risks you run.” “I admit, Fr?ulein, it was foolish, since it was scarcely fair to you. But at least I heard some interesting news.” “Tell me.” “That Prince Theodor cannot marry your Princess.” “Cannot?” “For he is secretly married already. So it follows that these ghastly political murders have all been unnecessary. There is every reason now why you should live.” “Ah!” “But unfortunately you died three days ago.” “I died—three days ago!” “So Count Furello told his Excellency.” She thought a moment. “Ah, yes, I understand.” “So it seems to me, Fr?ulein, that now it is only the Count you have to fear.” She gave a little shudder. “And that is bad enough. But at least I would rather a million times have his hate than his love. Ah, I cannot bear to think of it, yet I must tell you. About half an hour after you had gone yesterday the Count came to my prison room. He told me that to let me live was as much as his life was worth. His own risk was so great that only upon one condition would he face it. Of course you guess the condition; that I would marry him; otherwise that day must be my last. ‘Remember,’ he urged in his smooth hateful voice, ‘you are already dead in theory. The grave is dug for you in the wood outside; in ten minutes from the moment I give the word you will be lying in it. It is painful for me to have to tell you this, but my life is precious too; I cannot afford to risk it unless I have a stake to play for.’ “I pretended to be in great fear and distress, [Pg 214]which perhaps was not all pretence—but for your brave discovery what should I have felt? I begged for time; I could not die, I was too young for that, and yet—how could I love him at once? You see what a hypocrite I can be. He was rejoiced, when he saw signs of my yielding, at the success of his appeal. He went down on his knees and vowed he would gladly risk his life for one loving look from me, that he would be my slave—I need not recapitulate the hateful scene. Happily it was interrupted, just as I was beginning to fear I could not stave off his love-making without arousing his suspicions. The girl Telka came in; he turned upon her, furious at the interruption. She said to him under her breath, yet loud enough in her flurry for me to catch the words, ‘Rallenstein is here!’ He turned grey at the news, and his face changed to the index of the man he really is.” “I can well imagine it,” I said. “It was a critical moment for you.” “Yes. He turned upon me in panic with such a look in his eyes, a look in which fear, desperation, irresolution, cruelty, and what he would call love were all mingled. Ah! it was horrible. Then he took Telka out of the room, and the suspense of the next few minutes, when I was left alone, was so fearful that I almost fainted with terror. At last the door opened and Telka came back, followed by a wretch named Bleisst——” “I know. The Count’s head villain.” “If you know him you will realize what my feelings were at the sight. Then, indeed, I was sure that my last moment had come. My heart almost stopped with terror; oh, it was awful, the thought of having to die like that, there in that horrible place, and just as the hope of life and liberty had come to me. Telka came close up and spoke to me. I was so sick and [Pg 215]beside myself with fear that at first I did not comprehend her words. I cried out in my agony for mercy, for the Count—fancy my wishing his presence! The girl spoke again, entreating more plainly, and I understood her then. I was to be removed to a hiding-place in another part of the Monastery, for the Chancellor was to suppose me dead. No harm would befall me unless he discovered my whereabouts; everything would depend upon my keeping quiet and obeying orders. I mistrusted them——” “Naturally. No other feeling in that place could be possible.” “No, and Bleisst is the very incarnation of treachery. Still I could only obey. He told me pleasantly he had orders to shoot me on the spot if I resisted. So I went with them, Telka leading the way, Bleisst following me, pistol in hand. I felt like a condemned prisoner on my way to the scaffold, but it was not to be as bad as I feared. We went on for a long while, through dark passages, across vault-like chambers, till at length we ascended to a room on an upper floor. Here Bleisst went to the fire-place and unscrewed one of a row of knobs in the woodwork. Into the hole thus discovered he inserted a key. On turning this the jamb of the mantel revolved, disclosing a narrow aperture just wide enough for a person to pass through. Telka entered this, bidding me follow. I went in and found myself in a small chamber not much larger than this carriage. “‘You are to stay here till the Chancellor is safely gone,’ Telka said. ‘We shall bring you your meals as usual. It is uncomfortable, but it is necessary, and you have nothing to fear.’ “I had a great deal to fear; my imagination told me that this might be my living grave. What better way to get rid of me than to leave me here to starve [Pg 216]and die? The girl went, warning me that any attempt to escape would seal my fate. She is an extraordinary creature, of a nationality unknown even to herself; the daughter of a spy; she seems to have lived everywhere and to know everything. I have always thought she has hated me under her pretence of sympathy. So the door shut upon me and I was left alone with my thoughts; you may fancy how anxious and bitter they were.” “In the idea that our plan was rendered futile.” “Yes; I thought of you, and of all your courage, and the danger you had faced, and how they were to go for nothing. But there I was, helpless, well-nigh hopeless again. I would have given anything to have been able to send you a message, but that was impossible. Here was a prison within a prison. I stayed there in darkness for a long while—hours, it seemed; at last the muffled sound of the slowly opening door brought my terrors back to me. It was Telka with a lantern and some refreshments. The sight of this rejoiced me as evidence that the fear of starvation was groundless. I could even eat a morsel and drink some wine. “‘His Excellency is still here,’ she said. ‘Directly he is well on his way you shall be released.’ “She gave me one of her cunning smiles and disappeared. “So I passed the night trying to get sleep on some rugs which had been provided for my bed. In the morning Telka brought my breakfast. “‘Courage!’ she said. ‘His Excellency is about to start, and your release will come soon. It is lucky he did not suspect you were lying here so snug.’ She laughed, and left me without another word. But in about an hour she returned and beckoned me to come out. Bleisst was waiting, and they conducted me back to my former prison room. My joy at getting there [Pg 217]with the hope of escape was so great that I feared Telka’s sharp eyes might notice it. I feigned to be so upset and ill by the night I had passed that I could only go to bed. By this I hoped to avoid a visit from the Count, and certainly I was left to myself all day. Towards evening Telka came in and told me that the Count had accompanied Rallenstein from the Geierthal that morning, but was expected back that night. I still pretended to be very ill, and could see that the girl was quite unsuspicious of any idea of escape being so near at hand. I kept her with me for some time, then, as the critical hour approached, begged her to leave me for a good long sleep. Left alone I made ready for my departure, and the rest you know. Ah, those terrible days! Can I ever thank my preserver enough for all you have risked for me?” In listening to her story I had not noticed that for some time past a storm had been gathering. It now burst over us with a violence peculiar to those regions of mountainous woodland. The words deprecating her gratitude, which was, however, delightful enough to me, were drowned in a terrific thunderclap which burst over us. The rain came down so violently, the wind swept round us in such gusts, that we became concerned for Strode’s welfare, exposed as he was to their full fury. But he returned a cheery, “All right! Don’t worry about me,” to my entreaty that he would come into shelter. There was one thing, however, that the plucky fellow could hardly battle with, and that was the intense darkness that had enveloped us. Not to be stopped altogether, he jumped down from his seat, ran to the horses’ heads and led them on as well as he could. Our progress was now necessarily slow, but it was something to keep moving at all, and Strode was resolved that we should not stop. We watched anxiously for some indication [Pg 218]of a break in the storm, but its fury continued unabated, indeed it seemed to increase. “This is madness, Strode!” I shouted. “Make the horses fast and come inside.” Not he. The rain would not melt him, he was determined to get us across the frontier by the morning, and we were yet miles from the little town where we had planned to change horses. So we went on for a while in the full pelting of the storm. Suddenly a great flash of lightning seemed to sweep the road just in front of us. The horses reared in terror, then swerved, and, before Strode could prevent it, one side of the carriage sank into a ditch at the roadside. “Sit still!” Strode cried. But I had jumped out to lighten the vehicle. Each taking a horse’s head, we soon had the carriage on the level again. “We can’t go on in this,” I expostulated. As I spoke another great flash showed us a house standing near the road a few yards farther on. I called Strode’s attention to it, and insisted that we should seek refuge there till the storm was over; and, as the result proved, it was lucky I overruled him. Between us we led the horses up to the building, which proved to be a deserted and dilapidated wayside lodge. “At least there is perfect shelter here,” I said as I assisted the Fr?ulein to alight and hurried her into the tumble-down place. A ruinous shed stood beside the house and this afforded some sort of shelter for the horses. We gave them corn and made them as comfortable as we could. Then I took some food and a bottle of wine from the carriage, and ran back to the house. By the aid of the lantern we were just preparing to make the best of our wretched quarters when Strode rushed in with a more perturbed look than I had [Pg 219]thought him capable of. He caught up the lantern and extinguished it, checking my exclamation with,— “Quick! Help me to bar the door. They are after us! Hark! They are outside!”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2943/80892.html","bookId":1076,"book":{"id":1076,"title":"The Red Chancellor","description":"简介： Of what?
