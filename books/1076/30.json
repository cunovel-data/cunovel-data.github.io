{"id":40921,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI THE DARK WAY","content":"I had not been mistaken; it was a subterranean passage that I had come upon. The floor seemed to be on a considerable incline, and on groping my way a few yards in the ascending direction I found a short flight of stone steps. Certain light-admitting fissures in the earth above enabled me to see that these steps led to a sort of trap-door formed by a stone flag, giving exit, no doubt, to the surface above. Had I but suspected this I might have saved myself half an hour’s hard work; however, it was done now, and I turned to begin the descent of the passage. After passing my rough entrance I found myself faced, as the way ran deeper into the earth, by absolute darkness. Feeling in my pocket for my matchbox, I happily came upon the piece of candle which I had slipped into it the night before when the holder had served me so effectually for a weapon. This on being lighted seemed but to intensify the blackness in front of me, but at least it would keep my feet from pit-falls. The passage, damp, mouldy, and foul-smelling from the confined atmosphere, led downwards, and then having reached a certain depth, its course became level. On and on I went, the candle burning dimly in the vitiated air. But the way was clear, and, putting aside the influence of the dismal surroundings one could walk on without much discomfort. The passage seemed never ending, yet the farther it led [Pg 192]me on, the higher was my curiosity raised to find the end of it. Suddenly the ground began to dip again and a fairly long descent followed. This again was succeeded by a level stretch, but here the aspect of the tunnel changed. The roof and sides were covered with a slimy green ooze, the air became dank and chill, the darkness, if possible, more impenetrable. Clusters of nitre hung in fantastic shapes from the roof; the sensation of being buried alive was almost overpowering. But an idea which during my progress had gradually been taking shape in my head was now practically confirmed. The mysterious passage I calculated led direct towards the Monastery. This was the only conceivable explanation of its existence. The reason of the sudden dive and the reeking walls was that it was now running under the moat. If so, and there was scarcely room for doubt, it must lead to some part of the Monastery. This thought spurred me on to pursue my way through about as abominable a bolt-hole as man ever devised. But I was now at the end. The tunnel stopped abruptly at a winding flight of stone steps. Up these I climbed, laboriously enough, for no pains had been wasted on convenience; ascent was just practicable, and no more. When at length the top was reached I found my head against a wooden trap-door. I expected that this would be the end of that afternoon’s exploration, but to my joy I found that it was not fastened. Very cautiously I pushed it upwards, the shower of dust which was dislodged being almost welcome after the damp, noisome air I had been breathing. I found myself emerging into what seemed a cellar, anyhow a good-sized room in the basement of the Monastery. Nothing was to be heard; so far I was safe enough. I came up out of the stairway and [Pg 193]set about discovering where it had landed me. I had judged it expedient to put out my candle, for only just enough remained to take me back again, and the light might betray me. So I had to grope about in semi-darkness. The first thing was to feel round the walls for an outlet, and presently my touch told me the door was reached. This yielded to a push and I passed through. I was now in a passage at the farther end of which a faint light shone. Very, very cautiously now I stole along, stopping between each long, wary step to listen. As I drew near the light I could see that it came from a doorway which opened upon the passage. My position seemed risky in the extreme; gradually I neared the light, scarce daring to breathe. Nothing was to be heard, anxiously as I listened. At last I had crept to the doorway, and, after a pause, ventured to peep in. Then I saw that the light came through the barred window of an inner room. Having made certain of this and that the outer chamber was empty, I moved across till I could look through the window. The first glance showed me a sight which amply repaid all my toil and danger.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2943/80889.html","bookId":1076,"book":{"id":1076,"title":"The Red Chancellor","description":"简介： Of what?
