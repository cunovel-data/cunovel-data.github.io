{"id":15550,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. — SAM FINDS A ROOMMATE.","content":"Looking up, Sam\u0027s glance rested on a young man, of rustic dress and manners, which made him seem quite out of place in a fashionable hotel. \"No,\" answered Sam. \"I am a stranger in Boston. I came from New York.\" \"You don\u0027t say! It\u0027s an all-fired big city, isn\u0027t it?\" said the countryman. \"It is very large,\" said Sam, patronizingly. \"I live in the country,\" said the other—quite needlessly, so Sam thought—\"up in New Hampshire. I\u0027ve come down here to get a job.\" \"So have I,\" responded Sam, with new interest in his companion. \"Are you boardin\u0027 here?\" asked the countryman. \"No; I am going to try to find a boarding-place. The prices are too steep here.\" \"Let me go with you,\" said the young man, eagerly. Sam thought, on the whole, it would be pleasanter to have company, and accepted this proposal. They bought a copy of the Boston Herald and picked out a list of boarding-houses which appeared to come within their means. Among these were two on Harrison Avenue. One of these was the very house which had already been mentioned to Sam by his boy acquaintance of the morning. \"Do you know your way round the city?\" asked Sam of his companion. \"A little,\" said the other. \"Do you know how to go to Harrison Avenue?\" \"Yes, I know that.\" \"Is it far?\" \"Not very far. We can walk easy enough.\" \"That\u0027s all right, then. Let us go.\" The two set out on their expedition, walking up Washington Street as far as Essex, and, turning there, soon entered Harrison Avenue. They beguiled the time on the way by conversation. \"What, was you calc\u0027latin\u0027 to find to do?\" asked the countryman. \"I was clerk in a store in New York,\" said Sam; \"I\u0027d like to get into a store here.\" \"So should I.\" Sam privately thought him too countrified in appearance for the position he desired, but did not say so. \"Have you had any experience?\" he asked, curiously. \"Oh, yes; I used to drive the wagon for a grocery store, to hum.\" Sam privately doubted whether this experience would be of any particular value to his new acquaintance. However, he had not much faith in his own qualifications, and this concerned him more. \"What\u0027s your name?\" inquired Sam. \"Abner Blodgett,\" was the reply. \"What\u0027s yours?\" \"Sam Barker.\" \"You don\u0027t say! There\u0027s a doctor in our town by the name of Barker; any relation?\" \"I guess not. I never heard of a doctor in our family.\" Presently they reached the number indicated. Sam rang the bell. \"You are looking for a boarding-place,\" he explained. \"We saw your advertisement in the Herald.\" \"Walk in,\" said the servant. \"I\u0027ll tell Mrs. Campbell.\" Mrs. Campbell presently appeared; a shrewd-looking Scotch lady, but kindly in expression. \"You are looking for a boarding place, gentlemen?\" she inquired. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"I have one single room and one double one. For the single room I have eight dollars a week; for the double one fourteen, that is, seven dollars for each gentleman. Do you two gentlemen wish to room together?\" \"Yes,\" answered Blodgett, immediately; \"if you are willing,\" he added aside, to Sam. \"Let us look at the rooms,\" said Sam, \"and then we can tell better.\" \"Walk up this way, gentlemen,\" said Mrs. Campbell. She led the way first to the double room. It was a square room, the second floor back, and looked quite neat and comfortable. Sam liked the appearance of it, and so apparently did Abner Blodgett. \"Ain\u0027t it scrumptious, though?\" he said, admiringly. \"We ain\u0027t got many rooms like that to hum.\" \"I suppose you are from the country, sir?\" said Mrs. Campbell, with a good-natured smile. \"Yes,\" said Blodgett, \"I\u0027m from New Hampshire; away up near Mount Washington.\" \"Let me see the single room,\" requested Sam. The single room was shown; but it was, of course, much smaller, and the furniture was inferior. \"We\u0027d better take the big room together,\" said Abner. Sam hesitated a moment. He was not very particular, but he did not altogether fancy the appearance of Mr. Blodgett. \"How much do you charge for the large room for a single person?\" he asked. \"I couldn\u0027t take less than eleven dollars,\" said the landlady. It was, of course, impossible for Sam to pay any such sum, and he reluctantly agreed to occupy the room jointly with Mr. Blodgett. \"When will you move in?\" asked Mrs. Campbell. \"To-day,\" said Sam. \"I must ask you to pay something in advance, to secure the room, gentlemen.\" Sam had no luggage beyond a small bundle, and he answered at once, \"I\u0027ll pay a week in advance.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" Sam handed the landlady ten dollars and received in return three. \"I\u0027ll pay you to-morrow,\" said Blodgett. \"I\u0027ve got to get the money from my cousin.\" \"I\u0027ll wait till to-morrow to oblige you,\" said the landlady, \"but no longer.\" \"Oh, I\u0027ll have the money then,\" said Abner, confidently. \"Will you be here to dinner, gentlemen?\" \"When do you have dinner?\" \"At six o\u0027clock. We used to have it in the middle of the day, but it was inconvenient to some of our boarders, and we changed it.\" \"We have dinner to hum, where I live, at noon,\" said Abner. \"We have lunch at half-past twelve, if you choose to come.\" \"I guess we will,\" said Abner. \"We\u0027ll go out and take a walk, Mr. Barker, and come back in time.\" \"Just as you say,\" answered Sam. After a walk they returned to lunch. Sam was usually possessed of a good appetite, but he stared in astonishment when he saw Blodgett eat. That young man appeared to have fasted for a week, and ate accordingly. \"What\u0027s the matter with you, Mr. Barker? You don\u0027t eat nothin\u0027,\" he said. \"I had a late breakfast,\" said Sam. \"I guess you\u0027ll get your money\u0027s worth.\" \"I mean to. Seven dollars is an awful lot to pay for board. Up to hum they don\u0027t charge but three.\" \"Then I wish they\u0027d open a branch boarding-house here.\" \"Suppose we go over to Bunker Hill?\" said Sam, after lunch. \"I want to see the monument.\" \"Just as you say,\" said Abner. \"We can ask the way.\" \"There\u0027s some cars go over that way, I\u0027ve heerd,\" said Abner. As they were walking down Washington Street a young man, rather flashily attired, stopped Blodgett, whom he appeared to recognize. \"What\u0027s in the wind now?\" he asked. \"Who have you got in tow?\" \"It\u0027s my friend, Mr. Barker.\" \"How do you do, Mr. Barker?\" said the young man, who appeared very much amused about something. \"How\u0027s your father, the deacon?\" he inquired of Blodgett, and laughed again. \"Pretty smart,\" said Blodgett. \"Just give him my respects when you write, will you?\" \"I won\u0027t forget,\" The new acquaintance winked, and went his way. Sam was rather surprised at his manner, and also at the fact of his countrified companion being apparently on intimate terms with a person so different in appearance. \"Who is that?\" he asked. \"That\u0027s a young man from our town,\" said Mr. Blodgett. \"He\u0027s been living in Boston for five or six years. He\u0027s got a good place in Milk Street.\" \"What sort of a fellow is he?\" \"You don\u0027t say nothin\u0027 about it,\" said Abner, looking about him as if fearing to be overheard; \"but I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s a fast young man.\" \"Shouldn\u0027t wonder,\" said Sam. \"I\u0027ve heard that he plays cards!\" added Abner, in a horrified whisper. \"Very likely,\" said Sam, amused. He had had some suspicions of his companion, occasioned by the apparent good understanding between him and the young man they had met, but this remark dissipated them. He felt amused by the verdancy of Abner Blodgett, and anticipated a good deal of entertainment from his remarks. They took the horse cars to Bunker Hill; Sam paid the fare both ways, as his companion did not expect to have any money till tomorrow. He did not relish lending, his own stock of money being so scanty; but Abner was so confident of being in funds the next day that he did not refuse. He was interested in the view from the summit of the monument, and spent an additional hour in exploring Charlestown. When the two got back to Boston they found the afternoon well advanced and the dinner hour near. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82851.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
