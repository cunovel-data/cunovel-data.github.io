{"id":15538,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XI. — HENRY BECOMES A MERCHANT.","content":"While Sam was impatiently awaiting the drawing of the Havana lottery, Henry; too, made an investment, but of an entirely different character. He was in the employ of a shipping house, which dispatched vessels to different parts of the world with assorted cargoes. The head of the firm was James Hamilton, a man who stood deservedly high, not only in the mercantile world, but as a citizen. He had served his native city as an alderman, and had been offered the nomination for mayor by the party to which he belonged, but had declined, on account of the imperative claims of his private business. Mr. Hamilton had long noticed, with a feeling of approval, Henry Martin\u0027s faithful performance of duty. Though he had not promoted him rapidly, he was observing him carefully, fully determined to serve him in the future if he should deserve it. This Henry did not know. His employer was not a man of many words, and he was not aware that he had attracted his attention. Sometimes even he felt depressed by the thought that he was getting on so slowly. But it did not so affect him as to make him careless or neglectful of his duties. Even if he did not obtain promotion, he meant to deserve it. One morning, about this time, a clerk came to Henry, and said: \"Mr. Hamilton wishes to see you in his private office.\" Henry was a little startled. The idea came to him that he might have done something which had displeased his employer, and that he was to be reprimanded, perhaps discharged. This would be so disastrous to him that the thought of it made him turn pale. Still, think as he might, he could not call to mind any error he had committed, and this somewhat encouraged him. He entered the office, saying, respectfully: \"Did you wish to see me, sir?\" \"Yes,\" said the merchant, looking up from his writing; \"sit down, please.\" It may be remarked that it was Mr. Hamilton\u0027s custom to be as polite to his subordinates as to his social equals. Henry sat down. \"How long have you been in my employ, Henry?\" asked the merchant. \"I am now on my fourth year.\" \"How old are you?\" \"Nearly sixteen, sir.\" \"You entered upon your business career very early.\" \"Yes, sir, earlier than I wished, but I was obliged to earn my living, and had no choice.\" \"Have you parents living?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Are you entirely dependent upon what I pay you for your support?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I hope you don\u0027t get into debt?\" \"No, sir; I have even saved a little money.\" \"Indeed!\" said his employer, with interest. \"What have you done with it?\" \"Deposited it in the Sixpenny Savings Bank.\" \"That is well. How much have you saved?\" \"Thirty-five dollars. It isn\u0027t much, but it is a beginning.\" \"It is a good deal for a boy in your circumstances to save,\" said Mr. Hamilton, with emphasis. \"How much do I pay you?\" \"Five dollars a week.\" \"I suppose you consider that small pay?\" Henry smiled. \"Any addition will be acceptable,\" he answered; \"but I don\u0027t complain of it.\" \"It shall be raised to seven at once,\" said the merchant. \"Thank you, sir,\" said Henry, his face showing the delight he felt. \"You are very kind. I shall feel quite rich now.\" \"I suppose you will now live in a little better style,\" suggested Mr. Hamilton. \"I don\u0027t think I shall, sir. I shall increase my savings.\" \"That is well. I commend your self-denial and prudence. How much interest does the savings-bank pay you?\" \"Six per cent., sir.\" \"I will propose a different investment. I am about to send a cargo of goods to Rotterdam. The venture will, I think, prove a paying one. Would you like to join in it?\" Henry stared at his employer in surprise. How could he, a boy with thirty-five dollars capital, join in such an enterprise? \"I don\u0027t see how I can,\" he replied. \"I am afraid you take me for a capitalist.\" \"So you are,\" said his employer. \"Have you not money in the bank?\" Henry smiled. \"I don\u0027t think that will go very far,\" he said. \"Perhaps not, and, therefore, if you are going to take part in my venture, I suggest that you borrow five hundred dollars.\" Henry was surprised once more. He began to think Mr. Hamilton was out of his head. Yet he did not look so. On the contrary, as he smiled kindly upon Henry, he looked what he was, a shrewd, kindly, long-headed man of business. Still, he had just advised an almost penniless boy to borrow five hundred dollars. \"I don\u0027t know anybody that would lend me so much money,\" said Henry. \"Why don\u0027t you apply to me?\" suggested his employer. \"Would you lend me five hundred dollars?\" asked the boy, in surprise. \"Am I to regard that as an application?\" inquired Mr. Hamilton. \"Yes, sir,\" said Henry, \"if you think it well for me to borrow it.\" \"Then I answer yes, upon conditions. First, let me explain why I advise you to borrow. I have little doubt that you will find the venture a profitable one. Next, you may place your savings-bank book in my hands as security. Thirty-five dollars will pay a year\u0027s interest on the five hundred dollars I lend you; so my interest is secure.\" \"But suppose the speculation shouldn\u0027t pay, Mr. Hamilton?\" \"As to that, I know so much about it that I am willing to take the risk. I do not scruple to say that if the money were to be placed in your hands for investment, according to your own judgment, I should have some doubts as to your being able to repay it to me at the end of the year.\" \"Probably you are right, sir,\" said Henry. \"But, as it is, I am willing to take the risk. Do you think of any objections?\" \"I was only thinking,\" said Henry, \"that I might want to save up more money from my wages; but if you have the book I could not have them entered.\" \"There will be no trouble about that. Though you leave this book with me, you can start another account in another savings-bank. Indeed, I would advise you to do so. There is an old saying: \u0027Never put all your eggs in one basket.\u0027 So it may be as well to divide your money between two banks.\" \"I didn\u0027t think of that, sir. I will follow your advice.\" \"I don\u0027t know that I have any more to say to you. We understand each other now. I will put you down on my books as a partner, to the extent of five hundred dollars, in my Rotterdam shipment, and you may place the savings-bank book in my hands tomorrow.\" \"Thank you, sir. I am very grateful to you for your kind interest in me.\" \"That is a good boy one of the right stamp,\" soliloquized the merchant. \"A boy who has the prudence and self-denial to save money out of a weekly income of five dollars is bound to succeed in life. I will push him as he deserves.\" \"Well, Henry,\" asked the clerk, curiously, \"have you been receiving a lecture from the boss?\" \"Yes,\" answered Henry, smiling. \"Did he blow you up?\" \"Not very high.\" \"You\u0027ve been with him full twenty minutes.\" \"We were discussing important business,\" said Henry. \"I hope it was satisfactory to you.\" \"Very much so.\" \"You haven\u0027t had your pay raised, have you?\" \"Yes.\" \"How much?\" \"From five to seven dollars a week.\" \"That\u0027s a good raise. I wonder whether I\u0027m to be raised, too.\" \"Perhaps so.\" \"I hope so, for I\u0027m fifty dollars in debt, and don\u0027t see how I am to pay it.\" \"You get twelve dollars a week, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes; but what\u0027s twelve dollars?\" \"I have been living on five.\" \"And you don\u0027t owe anything?\" \"Not a cent.\" \"Blessed if I see how you do it! I need fifteen, and I ought to have it.\" \"He\u0027s like Sam,\" thought Henry. \"If Mr. Hamilton finds out that he is in debt, he won\u0027t stand much chance of having his wages raised. I\u0027m glad I\u0027ve got something ahead. It makes me feel independent. I hope I shall make something on my borrowed money.\" So Henry and Sam have both made investments. It remains to be seen how they will come out.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82839.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
