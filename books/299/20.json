{"id":15546,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. — MUTUAL CONFIDENCES.","content":"The reader who has followed Sam\u0027s fortunes closely may wonder how a boy so shabbily dressed as Sam, could be treated as an equal by a young lady of good family. This leads me to explain that about a month before Sam had been presented with a neat suit of clothes, originally made for a nephew of his employer, but which had proved too small. Thus it happened that, with the exception of his hat, which was rather the worse for wear, our hero presented quite a respectable appearance. Julia Stockton remained outside with Sam till the boat rounded the Battery, and for three-quarters of an hour longer. Sam was very well qualified to answer her numerous questions about the different places they passed. \"What is that island?\" asked Julia. \"That is Blackwell\u0027s Island,\" answered Sam. \"Is that where the penitentiary is?\" she inquired, with interest. \"Yes, it is that long stone building.\" \"How gloomy it is!\" said Julia, with a shudder. \"How can people be so wicked as to need to go to such a place?\" Sam winced. He knew very well that he had done things, or, at any rate, planned them, which would have entitled him to a place in the prison they were now passing. \"How ashamed I should be if I were ever sent there, and Julia should know it!\" he thought. \"What makes you look so sober?\" asked Julia. \"I was pitying the poor people who are confined there.\" \"It must be horrid, but I suppose it can\u0027t be helped. I don\u0027t see how anybody can want to steal.\" Sam thought he could understand. It was not so long since he himself had tried to appropriate the property of another; but he only determined that this should not happen again. He could not consent to forfeit the good opinion of Julia Stockton, and the class to which she belonged. A new ambition began to stir in Sam\u0027s soul—the ambition to lead a thoroughly respectable life, and to rise to some creditable position. \"I will turn over a new leaf, I really will,\" he said to himself. \"I\u0027ll be a very different boy from what I have been.\" They remained outside a while longer, till the steamer had passed through the channel into the broader waters of the Sound, and then re-entered the cabin. The gong for supper had already sounded. \"Won\u0027t you go down to supper?\" asked Sam. \"Yes, I think I will. You will come, too?\" \"Yes, I will go, too,\" answered Sam, feeling complimented by the invitation. As they were approaching the stairs, Julia dropped a scarf from her neck. It was picked up by a gentleman, who handed it to Sam, with the remark, \"Your sister has dropped her scarf.\" \"He takes you for my sister,\" said Sam, turning to Julia with evident pleasure. \"I am afraid you wouldn\u0027t own me for a sister,\" said Julia, smiling coquettishly. \"I should be proud to have such a sister,\" said Sam, earnestly. \"Would you, really?\" \"Yes, I would.\" \"I am afraid you only say so to compliment me.\" \"I mean it; but I am sure you would not want me for a brother.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Julia, with a roguish glance. \"Do you always behave well?\" \"I am afraid I don\u0027t always.\" \"Nor I either,\" returned Julia, in a burst of confidence. \"I used to play tricks on my governess sometimes.\" \"I don\u0027t think that is so very wicked,\" said Sam. \"Won\u0027t you tell me about some of them?\" \"After supper I will; but I wouldn\u0027t like to have anybody else hear.\" They sat down to the table side by side, and made a satisfactory repast. Sam tried to pay for Julia\u0027s, but here the young lady was firm. She insisted on paying her own bill, as indeed propriety required. When the supper was over, they returned to the saloon. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82847.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
