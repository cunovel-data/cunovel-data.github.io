{"id":15530,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III. — SAM FINDS A ROOM.","content":"\"Here\u0027s the letters,\" said Sam, as he entered the office on his return. \"You may carry them in to Mr. Dalton,\" said William Budd. \"Now for it!\" thought Sam, as he entered the counting-room with reluctant step. \"Here\u0027s the letters, Mr. Dalton,\" said our hero, looking embarrassed. Mr. Dalton took them, and glanced at the superscription. \"What\u0027s all this?\" he demanded. \"This letter is for Ferguson \u0026 Co. And so are the rest. What does it mean?\" \"I guess there\u0027s some mistake,\" said Sam, uncomfortably. \"Why did you take these letters? Did you think my name was Ferguson?\" demanded Mr. Dalton. \"No, sir.\" \"Didn\u0027t you know they were not for me, then?\" \"They gave them to me at the post office,\" stammered Sam. \"Did you give the number of my box?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"What number did you call for?\" \"I don\u0027t remember,\" answered Sam, abashed. \"Then you don\u0027t remember the number of my box?\" \"I don\u0027t remember now,\" Sam admitted. \"Did you call for No. 776?\" \"Yes,\" said Sam, promptly. \"That\u0027s not the number,\" said the merchant, quietly. \"You must return these letters instantly, and call for my mail. I will give you the number of my box on a card, and then you can\u0027t make any mistake. You have made a blunder, which must not be repeated.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Sam, glad to get off with no sharper admonition. He returned to the post office, and this time he did his errand correctly. At three o\u0027clock Sam was permitted to leave the office and look out for a boarding-place. He had managed to scrape acquaintance during the day with Henry Martin, an errand boy in the next store, and went to consult him. \"Where do you board?\" he asked. \"Near St. John\u0027s Park,\" answered Henry. \"Is it a good place?\" \"It will do.\" \"I want to find a place to board. Is there room where you are?\" \"Yes; you can come into my room, if you like.\" \"What\u0027ll I have to pay?\" \"I pay a dollar and seventy-five cents a week for my room, and get my meals out; but the old lady will let the two of us have it for two fifty.\" \"That\u0027ll make seventy-five cents for me,\" said Sam. \"How do you make that out?\" \"You pay just the same as you do now, and I\u0027ll make it up to two fifty.\" \"Look here, young fellow, you\u0027re smart, but that won\u0027t go down,\" said the other boy. \"Why not?\" asked Sam, innocently. \"You won\u0027t have to pay any more, will you?\" \"I would have to pay more than you, and I don\u0027t mean to do it. If we pay two fifty, that will be just one twenty-five apiece. That\u0027s better than you can do alone.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll try it,\" said Sam. \"When are you goin\u0027 round?\" \"As soon as I get through work—at five o\u0027clock.\" \"I\u0027ll wait for you.\" Sam might have gone back and finished out his afternoon\u0027s work, but it did not occur to him as desirable, and he therefore remained with his new friend, till the latter was ready to go with him. \"How much wages do you get?\" asked Sam, as they were walking along. \"Five dollars a week.\" \"So do I.\" \"Haven\u0027t you just gone into your place?\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027ve been in mine two years. I ought to get more than you.\" \"Why don\u0027t you ask for more?\" \"It wouldn\u0027t be any use. I have asked, and they told me to wait.\" \"When I\u0027ve been at work two years I expect to get ten dollars a week,\" said Sam. \"You\u0027ll have to take it out in expecting, then.\" \"Will I?\" asked Sam, rather crestfallen. \"The fact is, we boys don\u0027t get paid enough,\" said Henry. \"No, I guess not,\" said Sam, assenting readily. \"Do you have to work pretty hard?\" he inquired. \"As hard as I want to.\" \"It must be jolly to be a boss, and only have to read letters, and write \u0027em,\" said Sam, who had rather an inadequate notion of his employer\u0027s cares. \"I\u0027d like to be one.\" \"I\u0027ve got a rich uncle,\" said Henry Martin. \"I wish he\u0027d set me up in business when I\u0027m twenty-one.\" \"How much is he worth?\" \"About a hundred thousand dollars; I don\u0027t know but more.\" \"Do you think he will set you up?\" asked Sam, rather impressed. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"If he does, you might take me in with you.\" \"So I will, if your rich uncle will give you a lot of money, too.\" \"I haven\u0027t got no rich uncle,\" said Sam. \"I only wish I had.\" \"Mine is more ornamental than useful, so far,\" said Henry. \"Well, here we are at my place.\" They stood before a shabby, brick dwelling, which bore unmistakable marks of being a cheap lodging-house. \"It isn\u0027t very stylish,\" said Henry, apologetically. \"I ain\u0027t used to style,\" said Sam, with perfect truth. \"It\u0027ll do for me.\" \"I\u0027ll call Mrs. Brownly,\" said Henry, after opening the front door with a latchkey. \"We\u0027ll ask her about your coming in.\" Mrs. Brownly, being summoned, made her appearance. She was a tall, angular female, with the worn look of a woman who has a hard struggle to get along. \"Mrs. Brownly,\" said Henry Martin, \"here\u0027s a boy who wants to room with me. You said you\u0027d let the room to two for two dollars and a half a week.\" \"Yes,\" said she, cheered by the prospect of even a small addition to her income. \"I have no objection. What is his name?\" \"Same Barker,\" answered our hero. \"Have you got a place?\" asked Mrs. Brownly, cautiously. \"Yes, he\u0027s got a place near me,\" answered Henry Martin for him. \"I expect to be paid regularly,\" said Mrs. Brownly. \"I\u0027m a widow, dependent on what I get from my lodgers.\" \"I settle all my bills reg\u0027lar,\" said Sam. \"I ain\u0027t owin\u0027 anything except for the rent of a pianner, last quarter.\" Mrs. Brownly looked surprised, and so did Henry Martin. \"The room you will have here isn\u0027t large enough for a piano,\" she said. \"I ain\u0027t got no time to play now,\" said Sam; \"my business is too pressing.\" \"Will you pay the first week in advance?\" asked the landlady. \"I don\u0027t think it would be convenient,\" said Sam. \"Then can you give me anything on account?\" asked Mrs. Brownly. \"Half a dollar will do.\" Sam reluctantly drew out fifty cents and handed to her. \"Now, we\u0027ll go up and look at the room,\" said Henry. It was a hall bedroom on the second floor back which was to be Sam\u0027s future home. It appeared to be about six feet wide by eight feet long. There was a pine bedstead, one chair, and a washstand, which would have been improved by a fresh coat of paint. Over the bed hung a cheap print of Gen. Washington, in an equally cheap frame. A row of pegs on the side opposite the bed furnished conveniences for hanging up clothes. \"How do you like it?\" asked Henry Martin. \"Tiptop,\" answered Sam, with satisfaction. \"Well, I\u0027m glad you like it,\" said his companion. \"There\u0027s six pegs; you can use half of them.\" \"What for?\" asked Sam. \"To hang up your extra clothes, of course.\" \"I haven\u0027t got any except what I\u0027ve got on,\" said Sam. \"You haven\u0027t?\" \"No.\" \"I suppose you\u0027ve got some extra shirts and stockings?\" \"No, I haven\u0027t. I\u0027ve been unfortunate, and had to sell my wardrobe to pay my debts.\" Henry Martin looked perplexed. \"You don\u0027t expect to wear one shirt all the time, do you?\" he asked. \"I\u0027ll buy some more when I\u0027ve got money enough.\" \"You\u0027d better. Now let\u0027s go out, and get some supper.\" Sam needed no second invitation.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82831.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
