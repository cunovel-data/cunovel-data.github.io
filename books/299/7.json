{"id":15533,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. — SAM\u0027S LUCK.","content":"When towns and cities find their income insufficient to meet their expenditures, they raise money by selling bonds. Sam would gladly have resorted to this device, or any other likely to replenish his empty treasury; but his credit was not good. He felt rather bashful about applying to his roommate for money, being already his debtor, and, in his emergency, thought of the senior clerk, William Budd. \"Mr. Budd,\" he said, summoning up his courage, \"will you lend me a dollar?\" \"What for?\" inquired the young man, regarding him attentively. \"I haven\u0027t got anything to pay for my meals the rest of the week,\" said Sam. \"How does that happen?\" \"I can\u0027t live on five dollars a week.\" \"Then suppose I lend you a dollar, I don\u0027t see that you will be able to repay me.\" \"Oh, I\u0027ll pay you back,\" said Sam, glibly. \"Have you got any security to offer me?\" \"Any security?\" asked Sam, who was inexperienced in business. \"Yes. Have you got any houses or lands, any stocks or bonds, which you can put in my hands as collateral?\" \"I guess not,\" said Sam, scratching his head. \"If I had any houses, I\u0027d sell \u0027em, and then I wouldn\u0027t have to borrer.\" \"So you can\u0027t get along on five dollars a week?\" \"No.\" \"The boy that was here before you lived on that.\" \"I\u0027ve had to pay a lot of money for clothes,\" Sam explained, brightening up with the idea. \"How much?\" \"Well, I had to buy the suit I have on, and then I had to get some shirts the other day.\" \"How much does it cost you for billiards?\" asked William Budd, quietly. Sam started and looked embarrassed. \"Billiards?\" he stammered. \"Yes, that\u0027s what I said.\" \"Who told you I played billiards?\" \"No one.\" \"I guess you\u0027re mistaken, then,\" said Sam, more boldly, concluding that it was only a conjecture of his fellow clerk. \"I don\u0027t think I am. I had occasion to go into French\u0027s Hotel, to see a friend in the office, and I glanced into the billiard room. I saw you playing with another boy of about your age. Did he beat you?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you had to pay for the game. Don\u0027t you think, as your income is so small, that you had better stop playing billiards till you get larger pay?\" \"I don\u0027t play very often,\" said Sam, uneasily. \"I advise you not to let Mr. Dalton know that you play at all. He would be apt to think that you were receiving too high pay, since you could afford to pay for this amusement.\" \"I hope you won\u0027t tell him,\" said Sam, anxiously. \"No, I don\u0027t tell tales about my fellow clerks.\" \"Then won\u0027t you lend me a dollar?\" inquired Sam, returning to the charge. \"I would rather not, under the circumstances.\" Sam was disappointed. He had five cents left to buy lunch with, and his appetite was uncommonly healthy. \"Why wasn\u0027t I born rich?\" thought Sam. \"I guess I have a pretty hard time. I wish I could find a pocket-book or something.\" Sam was a juvenile Micawber, and trusted too much to something turning up, instead of going to work and turning it up himself. However, strangely enough, something did turn up that very afternoon. Restricted to five cents, Sam decided to make his lunch of apples. For this sum an old woman at the corner would supply him with three, and they were very \"filling\" for the price. After eating his apples he took a walk, being allowed about forty minutes for lunch. He bent his steps toward Wall Street, and sauntered along, wishing he were not obliged to go back to the office. All at once his eye rested on a gold ring lying on the sidewalk at his feet. He stooped hurriedly, and picked it up, putting it in his pocket without examination, lest it might attract the attention of the owner, or some one else who would contest its possession with him. \"That\u0027s almost as good as a pocket-book,\" thought Sam, elated. \"It\u0027s gold—I could see that. I can get something for that at the pawnbroker\u0027s. I\u0027ll get some supper to-night, even if I can\u0027t borrer any money.\" Some boys would have reflected that the ring was not theirs to pawn; but Sam, as the reader has found out by this time, was not a boy of high principles. He had a very easy code of morality, and determined to make the most of his good fortune. When he got a chance he took a look at his treasure. There was a solitary diamond, of considerable size, set in it. Sam did not know much about diamonds, and had no conception of the value of this stone. His attention was drawn chiefly to the gold, of which there was considerable. He thought very little of the piece of glass, as he considered it. \"I\u0027d orter get five dollars for this,\" he thought, complacently. \"Five dollars will be a great help to a poor chap like me. I\u0027ll go round to the pawnbroker\u0027s just as soon as I get out of the store.\" William Budd was rather puzzled by Sam\u0027s evident good spirits. Considering that he was impecunious enough to require a loan which he had been unable to negotiate, it was rather remarkable. \"Have you succeeded in borrowing any money, Sam?\" he asked, with some curiosity. \"No,\" answered Sam, with truth; \"I haven\u0027t asked anybody but you.\" \"You don\u0027t seem to mind it much.\" \"What\u0027s the use of fretting?\" said Sam. \"I\u0027m expecting a legacy from my uncle.\" \"How much?\" \"Five dollars.\" \"That isn\u0027t very large. I hope you won\u0027t have to wait for it too long.\" \"No, I hope not. I guess I\u0027ll get along.\" \"Did you get any lunch?\" \"Yes, I bought three apples.\" \"Did they fill you up?\" asked Budd, with a smile. \"There\u0027s a little room left,\" answered Sam, \"if you\u0027d like to try the experiment.\" \"There\u0027s a peanut, then.\" \"Thankful for small favors. I\u0027m afraid it\u0027ll be lonely if you don\u0027t give me another.\" \"Take that, then; it\u0027s the last one I have.\" \"He\u0027s a good-natured boy, after all,\" thought the young clerk. \"Some boys would have been offended with me for having refused to lend.\" He did not understand the cause of Sam\u0027s good spirits, but thought him unusually light hearted. When the office closed, and Sam was released from duty, he took his way at once to a small pawn office with which he had become familiar in the course of his varied career, though he had not often possessed anything of sufficient value to pawn. The pawnbroker, a small old man, a German by birth, scanned Sam attentively, regarding him as a possible customer. \"How do you do, my boy?\" he said, politely. \"Oh, I\u0027m tiptop. Have you got any money to give away?\" \"What shall I give it for?\" asked the old man. \"I\u0027ve got a ring here,\" said Sam, \"that I want to pawn.\" \"Show it to me.\" The pawnbroker started in surprise and admiration when his eye fell on the sparkling brilliant. \"Where did you get it?\" he asked. \"It was left by my grandmother,\" said Sam, promptly. The pawnbroker shrugged his shoulders, not believing a word of the story. \"Isn\u0027t it a nice ring?\" asked Sam. \"So so,\" answered the old man. \"I have seen much better. How much do you want for it?\" \"How much will you give me?\" \"Two dollars,\" answered the old man. \"Then you won\u0027t get it,\" said Sam. \"You won\u0027t get it for a cent under five.\" \"That is too much,\" said the old man, from force of habit. \"I\u0027ll give you four.\" \"No, you won\u0027t. You\u0027ll give me five; and I won\u0027t sell it for that, neither. I may want to get it back, as it was my aunt\u0027s.\" \"You said your grandmother left it to you,\" said the old man, shrewdly. \"So she did,\" answered Sam, unabashed; \"but she left it to my aunt first. When my aunt died it came to me.\" Without dwelling upon the efforts which the pawnbroker made to get the ring cheaper, it is sufficient to say that Sam carried his point, and marched out of the store with five dollars and a pawn ticket in his pocket. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82834.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
