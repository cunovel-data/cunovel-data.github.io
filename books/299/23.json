{"id":15549,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. — FIRST EXPERIENCES IN BOSTON.","content":"\"Mamma,\" said Julia, after the first greeting was over, \"this young gentleman is Mr. Sam Barker, who has been very polite to me.\" \"I am much indebted to you, Mr. Barker,\" said Mrs. Stockton, cordially extending her hand, \"for your kindness to my daughter.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s nothing,\" said Sam, embarrassed. \"I didn\u0027t do anything.\" \"I met him on the boat, mamma, and he saw me on the train, and when there was nobody to meet me he came home with me in the hack.\" \"Your father was at the depot on the arrival of the first train,\" said Mrs. Stockton. \"As you did not come then, he concluded you did not start yesterday afternoon. He was surprised that you did not telegraph him.\" \"I did come, mamma; but, would you believe it, I slept so sound I didn\u0027t hear the gong, nor Sam either. Did you, Sam?\" \"We both slept pretty sound,\" said Sam. \"Well, Julia, I am glad you got through without accident. Have you had any breakfast?\" \"Not a mouthful, mamma. I\u0027m as hungry as a bear.\" \"I will have some sent up at once. Mr. Barker, I hope you will join my daughter at breakfast.\" \"Thank you,\" said Sam, not without satisfaction, for he certainly did feel frightfully hungry. A substantial breakfast was brought up, and, unromantic as it may seem, both Sam and Julia made great havoc among the eatables. \"I don\u0027t think I ever felt so hungry in the whole course of my life,\" said Julia. \"Did you, Sam?\" \"I never did, either,\" said Sam, with his mouth full. \"My dear,\" said Mrs. Stockton, \"Mr. Barker will think you very familiar. It is not the custom to use a gentleman\u0027s first name on such short acquaintance.\" \"I feel as if I had known Sam ever so long. He asked me to call him by his first name.\" Mrs. Stockton smiled. Considering Sam\u0027s youth, she did not think it necessary to press the matter. \"Is this your first visit to Boston, Mr. Barker?\" she inquired. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"I hope you will like it.\" \"I think I shall, ma\u0027am.\" \"Are you a New Yorker?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"I know something of New York. In what part of the city do you live?\" Sam was rather embarrassed. He did not like to mention the unfashionable street where he had lodged. \"I boarded downtown,\" he answered, indefinitely; \"to be near my business.\" \"You are young to have been in business.\" \"I was a clerk in a Pearl Street store,\" said Sam. \"Are you visiting Boston on business?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am. I shall try to find a place here.\" \"I hope you may succeed.\" \"Thank you, ma\u0027am.\" By this time breakfast was over, and Sam rose. \"I think I\u0027ll be going,\" he said. Julia did not seek to detain him. The fact was, that after her absence there were quite a number of things she wanted to do, among others to unpack her trunk. \"What hotel are you going to stop at?\" she inquired. \"I haven\u0027t made up my mind,\" answered Sam, embarrassed. He well knew that it would be very foolish for him to engage board at a first-class hotel. \"Parker\u0027s is a good hotel,\" suggested Julia. \"It\u0027s on School Street, not far from here.\" \"I would recommend a boarding-house,\" said Mrs. Stockton. \"The Parker House is expensive, and, if Mr. Barker is going to stay for some time he may wish to get along more economically.\" \"I think I shall,\" said Sam. \"Be sure and call again,\" said Julia, extending her hand. \"We shall be glad to see you again, Mr. Barker,\" said Mrs. Stockton, cordially. \"Mr. Stockton will wish to thank you for your attention to Julia.\" Sam thanked her, and went out into the street. He had enjoyed a good breakfast, and been cordially received by a lady who evidently stood high socially; and these circumstances contributed to put him in good spirits. \"I like Boston,\" he thought. \"The people take more notice of a fellow than they do in New York.\" Sam was generalizing upon his very limited experience, and perhaps might be led hereafter to change his views. \"Julia spoke of Parker\u0027s Hotel,\" he said to himself. \"I guess I\u0027ll inquire where it is, and take a look at it.\" \"Where is Parker\u0027s Hotel?\" he asked of a boy who overtook him near the State House. \"It\u0027s on School Street. I\u0027m going as far as Tremont Street myself, and you can come along with me,\" answered the boy. \"Thank you,\" said Sam. \"I am a stranger in Boston, and don\u0027t know my way.\" \"Are you going to stop at Parker\u0027s?\" \"I don\u0027t think I shall; I am afraid they will charge too much.\" \"It\u0027s pretty high-priced,\" said his new acquaintance. \"Do you know what they charge for a room?\" \"A dollar and a half and two dollars a day—that is, for the common rooms.\" \"That\u0027s too much for me.\" \"Then you\u0027ve got your meals to pay for besides.\" \"I shall try to find a boarding-house,\" said Sam. \"Do you know of any?\" \"There\u0027s an acquaintance of mine, a clerk, who boards on Harrison Avenue.\" \"Where is that?\". \"Not far from Washington Street—up near the Boston and Albany depot.\" \"Is it near the depot where I came in from New York?\" \"How did you come?\" \"By the Fall River line.\" \"Then it isn\u0027t far away. I\u0027ll give you the number if you want it.\" \"I wish you would.\" \"Here\u0027s Tremont Street,\" said the guide, \"and that is the Parker House.\" \"Thank you,\" said Sam. He went into the hotel, and, ascending a short staircase, found himself in the office. On one side was a writing-room, on the other a reading-room. \"It looks like a good hotel,\" thought Sam. \"I should like it if I could afford to stay here.\" Sam went into the reading-room, and saw lying on a chair a file of a New York paper. It seemed in this strange place like a familiar friend. He was reading the local news, when some one addressed him in a nasal voice: \"I say, yeou, do yeou live round here?\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82850.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
