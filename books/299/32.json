{"id":15558,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI. — TWO YEARS LATER.","content":"More than two years have elapsed. In the fine old home at Brookline, Sam and Arthur are sitting out on the lawn. Both have changed. Arthur looks stronger and better than when Sam first made his acquaintance, His thin face is more full, his pallor has been succeeded by a faint tinge of color, and he looks contented and happy. But the greatest change has come over Sam. He is now a young man of eighteen, well-formed and robust, handsomely dressed, with a face not only attractive, but intelligent. These two years have improved him greatly, as we shall see. \"I can hardly realize that Charlie is to graduate next week,\" said Arthur. \"He was a sophomore when I first met him,\" said Sam. \"How little I thought that the meeting would be so important to me!\" \"And to me!\" said Arthur. \"You have up idea how lonely I felt before you came.\" \"You have an idea how ignorant I was at that time,\" said Sam. \"You didn\u0027t know much, to be sure,\" said Arthur, smiling. \"I remember how I had to drill you in the multiplication table.\" \"My spelling was rather weak,\" said Sam. \"I should say it was; it was original, at least,\" said Arthur. \"To tell the truth, I was rather dismayed when I found how little you knew. But you have made it up bravely.\" \"Yes,\" said Sam, complacently, \"I think have; but still you are ahead of me.\" \"Not in all things. You write a much better hand than I.\" \"I am afraid it is my only accomplishment,\" said Sam. \"But not your only acquisition. You are a good English scholar. I don\u0027t mind telling you, however, that in the first three months I never expected you would be.\" \"I used to have the headache pretty often about that time,\" said Sam. \"Yes; I sympathized with you at first, till I began to suspect that it was all put on.\" \"It was harder for me to apply myself than you, Arthur. My street life made it so. It was only by degrees that I got the habit of application.\" \"It was a good thing for me that I had to assist you. It gave me an object in life. Besides, it made me work harder myself in order to continue able to do it. I used to get low-spirited, and feel that I was of no use in the world.\" \"You don\u0027t feel so now,\" said Sam, with a look of affection; for Arthur seemed to him like a dear, younger brother, whom it was his duty to care for and protect. \"Oh, no,\" said Arthur, cheerfully. \"I am much better and stronger now. And that leads me to a little secret which affects both you and me. Would you like to hear it?\" \"Yes, Arthur.\" \"Father is going to take both of us into the office, to learn business. I shall only be there about half the day, but you will have full hours. How will you like that?\" \"It is the very thing I would like above all others,\" said Sam, with animation. \"I want to be doing something. I want to earn my own living. When are we to go into the office?\" \"On the first of September.\" \"Not till then?\" \"No; we are to spend the summer at the White Mountains. Late in August Charlie will sail for Europe, where he is to travel for a year, and we two are to be disposed of as I have told you.\" \"It was a lucky day for me, Arthur, when I became your companion. But for that I might have been the same shiftless fellow I was before, fit for nothing except to run errands or sell newspapers.\" \"Are you sure you are fit for anything better now?\" asked Arthur, mischievously. \"I hope so,\" said Sam. \"Time will show.\" The arrangement indicated was carried out. Sam, through his bright, sunny disposition, had become a favorite with all the Browns, who, besides, felt grateful to him for the good effect his companionship had had upon Arthur\u0027s health and happiness. It had long been understood between Charlie and his father that Sam was eventually to be taken into the office, and promoted as rapidly as his abilities would justify. He was allowed a liberal salary, and continued a member of Mr. Brown\u0027s family. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82859.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
