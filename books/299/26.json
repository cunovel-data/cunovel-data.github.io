{"id":15552,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. — IN PURSUIT OP A PLACE.","content":"Sam was more angry than discouraged when he reflected upon the imposition which had been practiced upon him. His indignation was excited when he considered how his confidence had been betrayed. Presently it occurred to him that Abner had served him no worse than he intended to serve his roommate in New York. The thought made him ashamed. \"I didn\u0027t think I was acting so mean,\" he said to himself. \"I am glad Henry didn\u0027t lose anything by me.\" Another thought followed, and one which inspires confidence in Sam\u0027s reformation: \"I\u0027d rather have the money stolen from me than steal it from somebody else.\" It was quite true that Sam\u0027s conscience had become more sensitive than formerly. His meeting with Julia Stockton on board the Fall River boat had kindled in him a new and honorable ambition to attain a respectable position in society. In a strange city, separated from his street acquaintances, it really seemed as if he stood some chance of realizing his hope, when he was met at the outset with this discouraging loss. But Sam was not discouraged. He had been dependent upon his own resources for too many years to give up easily. Moreover, he was hopeful and sanguine by temperament, and determined to make the best of his position. There was this to encourage him. He had paid a week\u0027s board in advance, and therefore was sure of regular meals, and a comfortable lodging for six days to come. In that time he might get a situation. \"As you are alone, Mr. Barker,\" said Mrs. Campbell, \"I am afraid I must put you into the single room. I may have opportunities to let this to two persons.\" \"All right,\" said Sam, \"but I have only paid seven dollars. You said you should expect eight for the small room.\" \"No matter about that for this week,\" said the landlady. \"You have been unfortunate, and I will take that into consideration.\" \"Thank you. When I\u0027m a rich merchant I\u0027ll make it up to you.\" \"I hope you will become one, for your own sake,\" said Mrs. Campbell, smiling. When breakfast was over, Sam strolled out into the streets. He felt that the sooner he got something to do the better. Certainly in his situation there was no time to lose. He had found out that the leading retail stores were on Washington Street, and it seemed to him a good plan to begin there. The first he selected was a dry-goods store. He entered, and looked about him, inquiringly. A salesman asked him, briskly: \"What can I show you to-day?\" \"If you\u0027ll show me a situation where I can make a living, you\u0027ll oblige me,\" answered Sam. \"We don\u0027t keep such goods for sale,\" said the salesman, smiling. \"Then perhaps you give them away. Can I speak to the boss?\" \"There he is,\" said the young man—\"at the end of the store.\" \"What is his name?\" \"Hunter.\" Sam was not bashful. He went up to Mr. Hunter and called him by name. \"Can I speak to you on business?\" he asked. \"What kind of business?\" \"I want a place,\" said Sam, bluntly. \"We are not engaging any new clerks at present. Where do you live?\" \"I have just come from New York.\" \"Did you have any experience there in the dry-goods line?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Then you know nothing about it.\" \"Oh, yes, sir; I can tell calico from silk.\" \"That\u0027s more than I can always do,\" said Mr. Hunter, jocosely. \"I took you for silk, and I find you to be calico.\" \"You\u0027ve got me there,\" said Sam. \"Then you can\u0027t give me anything to do?\" \"I don\u0027t think it would be for my advantage to engage you. Do you think so?\" \"I think it would be for mine,\" said Sam. \"I guess I will look further.\" \"I am afraid I don\u0027t know much about business,\" thought Sam. \"I wish I knew what I am fit for, and I\u0027d go for it.\" He kept on his way down Washington Street, and entered the next large store, where he repeated his request for a place. Here he was not so well treated. \"Clear out, you young loafer!\" was the rude response. \"Thank you,\" said Sam, coolly. \"You\u0027re extremely polite.\" \"I don\u0027t waste my politeness on such fellows as you,\" said the clerk, disagreeably. \"I wouldn\u0027t,\" retorted Sam. \"You don\u0027t seem to have any to spare.\" \"I guess I don\u0027t stand much chance there,\" he considered. \"I wouldn\u0027t want to be in the same store with that hog, anyway.\" The next store was devoted to millinery. Just outside was a small piece of paper on which Sam read \"Little Girl Wanted.\" He went in. Those in charge of the store he found to be females. \"You\u0027ve got a notice in the window for help,\" said Sam. \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"Do you want it for your sister?\" \"I think not,\" replied Sam. \"I haven\u0027t any sister, to begin with.\" \"Then what is your business?\" \"I want a place for myself.\" \"Did you read the notice? It says \u0027Little Girl Wanted.\u0027 Are you a little girl?\" \"Not that I am aware of,\" said Sam; \"but I can do a little girl\u0027s work.\" \"Perhaps you would not be willing to take a little girl\u0027s pay.\" \"How much is the pay?\" \"Two dollars a week.\" \"Declined with thanks,\" said Sam, promptly. \"I don\u0027t like to disappoint you, but that wouldn\u0027t pay for my wardrobe.\" The lady smiled. \"I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t do anything for you,\" she said, amused. \"So am I,\" said Sam. Presently he discovered a sign, \"Boy Wanted,\" and this inspired in him some hope. He entered, and made known his wishes. \"You are altogether too large,\" said a brisk-looking man, eying him rapidly. \"We want a boy of twelve.\" \"Can\u0027t I do as much as a boy of twelve?\" asked Sam. \"Probably you can. Do you reside with your parents?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Where do you live?\" \"I board on Harrison Avenue.\" \"How much do you pay for board?\" \"Seven dollars a week.\" \"Have you any means of your own?\" \"No.\" \"Then you don\u0027t want a situation with us. We give only three dollars a week.\" By this time Sam began to feel a little despondent. There were situations for small girls and small boys, but none for him. \"Why didn\u0027t I stay a small boy?\" he reflected. But, after all, it is a question whether three dollars would defray the expenses of even a small boy. \"Boston don\u0027t seem to be much of a business place, after all,\" thought Sam; but, perhaps, it was hardly fair to draw such a conclusion from his own failure to procure a situation. Sam made one or two more ineffectual applications, which did not tend to improve his spirits. As he came out of the last one, he saw, to his great joy, Julia Stockton passing by. She recognized him at the same moment. \"Good-morning, Mr. Barker,\" she said, frankly, holding out her hand. \"Are you out shopping this morning?\" \"It\u0027ll be some time before I go shopping,\" said Sam. \"Why so?\" \"I had all my money stolen last night.\" \"You did! What a shame! Tell me all about it,\" said Julia, sympathizingly. Sam told his story, the young lady showing her warm sympathy in her expressive face. \"How will you get along without money?\" she asked. \"I must get a place right off,\" said Sam. \"If—if you wouldn\u0027t mind,\" said Julia, in an embarrassed tone, \"I have five dollars that I have no use for. Won\u0027t you let me lend it to you?\" Sam, to his credit be it spoken, declined the tempting proposal. \"I am just as much obliged to you, Miss Julia,\" he said, \"but I can get along somehow. I have got my board paid for a week in advance, and something will turn up in that time, I am sure.\" \"Won\u0027t you take it, then? I really don\u0027t need it,\" said Julia, earnestly. \"If I get very hard up, I\u0027ll remember your kind offer,\" said Sam. \"You\u0027ll be sure to do it, Sam?\" \"Yes, I\u0027ll be sure.\" \"I must bid you good-morning now,\" said Julia. \"I\u0027m going into Loring\u0027s Library to get a new book. Here it is, close by. I am glad I met you.\" \"Thank you,\" said Sam. \"Don\u0027t forget to call at the house. Mamma will be glad to see you.\" \"I would feel more like calling, if I had a place,\" thought Sam, soberly. \"She\u0027s a bully girl and no mistake, but I wouldn\u0027t like to take money from her. It\u0027s the first time I ever refused five dollars that I can remember.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82853.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
