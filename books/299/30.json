{"id":15556,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. — ARTHUR BROWN.","content":"At half-past five Sam and his companion reached the home of the latter in Brookline. It was a handsome mansion, with ample grounds, standing some rods back from the street. \"That\u0027s where I live, Sam,\" said the young student. \"It\u0027s an elegant place,\" said Sam, admiringly \"I hope your father\u0027ll take me. I\u0027d like to live here ever so much.\" \"There\u0027s my brother the one I spoke to you about.\" Brown pointed out a boy considerably smaller than Sam, who was hurrying to the gate as fast as his lameness would admit. His thin, pale face was lighted up with joy, as he espied his brother. \"I am glad you have come, Charlie,\" he said. \"It\u0027s so lonely here during the week.\" \"And how are you feeling, Arthur?\" asked his brother, laying his hand caressingly on the shoulder of the younger boy. \"Oh, I\u0027m all right; only lonely.\" \"I\u0027ve brought you some company—don\u0027t you see?\" For the first time Arthur\u0027s attention was drawn to Sam. \"I am glad to see you,\" he said, politely extending his hand. \"Are you a friend of Charlie\u0027s?\" \"Yes, Arthur,\" the student replied, anticipating our hero. \"This is my friend, Sam Barker.\" \"Are you in college, Mr. Barker?\" asked Arthur. \"Please call me Sam,\" said our hero. \"I am only a boy, and I don\u0027t begin to know enough to be in college.\" \"Nor I, either,\" said Arthur. \"Come into the house,\" said the elder brother. \"Has father got back from the city?\" \"No; he sent word that he should not be back till evening. We are to take supper without him. You are going to stop over Sunday, I hope, Charlie?\" \"Yes, till to-morrow evening. Sam will stay, too. Won\u0027t you take him up to the little room next to yours? He will want to wash before supper.\" Sam did not know that he needed to wash, but accepted this as a hint. \"Won\u0027t it be too much trouble for you?\" he asked, thinking of Arthur\u0027s lameness. \"Oh, no,\" said the lame boy. \"I can go upstairs almost as quick as if I wasn\u0027t lame. Come this way, please.\" Sam followed him upstairs. He was shown to a small, but handsomely furnished chamber. \"You\u0027ll find everything you need, I think,\" said Arthur. \"That room,\" pointing to one adjoining, \"is mine; so we shall be near neighbors.\" \"I am glad of that. If burglars get in in the night, I\u0027ll come to you for protection.\" \"I am afraid I couldn\u0027t do you much good. You are a great deal stronger than I.\" \"Then I\u0027ll protect you.\" \"Do you live in Boston, Sam?\" \"I only came to Boston a few days ago. I came from New York.\" \"Did you live in the city?\" \"Yes. Were you ever there?\" \"I have passed through New York on my way to Saratoga. I went up the Hudson River on a steamboat.\" \"We call it the North River there.\" \"We stopped at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.\" \"That\u0027s a tiptop hotel. I\u0027ve been in there often.\" \"Are you going to live in Boston?\" \"If I can find anything to do. I am not rich like you.\" \"No,\" said Arthur; \"but you are something better.\" \"What is better than being rich?\" asked Sam, incredulously. \"You are strong and healthy. You are not an invalid like me.\" \"How long have you been lame, Arthur?\" inquired Sam, who had naturally a kind heart, and was already beginning to feel an interest in his new friend. \"Ever since I was a very small boy.\" \"Your brother is strong enough.\" \"Yes, Charlie\u0027s got muscle,\" said Arthur, proudly. \"He\u0027s one of the strongest fellows in his class. He goes to gymnasium regularly. You ought to feel his arm. He\u0027s going to belong to the boat club next year.\" By this time Sam had finished his ablutions. \"Come downstairs, and I\u0027ll show you the stable,\" said Arthur. \"I guess there\u0027ll be time before supper.\" \"How many horses have you got?\" \"Three carriage horses. Father would buy me a pony, but he\u0027s afraid I might fall, and not be able to help myself.\" \"Do you go to school?\" \"No; my health is not good enough. The doctor says I must be out in the open air a good deal, and must not overtax my brain. I suppose you have been to school a good deal.\" \"Well, no,\" said Sam; \"I am afraid of overtaxing my brain, too.\" Arthur laughed. \"I don\u0027t think, from your looks, that you need feel afraid,\" he said. \"You\u0027ve no idea how delicate I am,\" said Sam, humorously. \"I should think you might be,\" said Arthur, merrily; \"but you are very successful in not showing it.\" \"That\u0027s why I don\u0027t get any sympathy. What do you do all day long if you don\u0027t go to school?\" \"I study some, and recite to a tutor who comes out from Boston; but I have a good deal of time to myself. I\u0027ve been very lonely since my mother died,\" he added, soberly. \"How long ago was that?\" Sam inquired, with sympathy. \"A year ago. Her death was a great loss to me, as Charlie has been away from home so much, and father is all day in the city.\" \"Are there no boys round here that you can play with?\" \"There are boys, but I can\u0027t join in their sports, on account of my lameness.\" \"I wonder whether he will like the idea of my staying with him,\" thought Sam. \"We could have good times together.\" They went out to the stable, and looked about till the supper-bell rang. Everything was well arranged, and on a scale which indicated that Mr. Brown was a man of wealth. More and more Sam though he would like to live there. Entering the dining-room, where the supper was provided, they found the older brother already present. \"Have you two boys got acquainted?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" said Arthur; \"it didn\u0027t take us long. I\u0027ve been showing Sam the stable.\" \"How do you like what you have seen?\" asked the sophomore. \"Tiptop,\" said Sam. \"Take a seat there, Sam; Arthur, you know your place. I must preside in father\u0027s absence.\" They talked together socially during the meal, Sam getting to feel better and better acquainted as time went on. After supper they took another walk, and then Arthur asked: \"Do you play backgammon, Sam?\" \"I never learned.\" \"Shall I show you?\" \"I wish you would.\" The backgammon board was brought out, and the two boys had a pleasant evening. As the older brother heard their lively laughter, and noticed how Arthur seemed brightened up by Sam\u0027s companionship, he felt more and more that it would be a good plan to keep him there. When his father reached home, a little before nine o\u0027clock, he made the proposal to him. \"I am convinced,\" he said, \"that Arthur needs a young companion, of a cheerful temperament, who will brighten him up, and keep him in good spirits. \"Do you know anything of this boy?\" asked Mr. Brown, cautiously. \"Not much, except that Arthur appears to fancy him. His education has been neglected.\" \"That would not matter. He could study regularly with Arthur, and recite to his tutor.\" \"That occurred to me.\" \"Has he any bad habits?\" \"No confirmed bad habits. If it should prove so, he can be dismissed.\" \"Would he like to come?\" \"Of that I am sure. Indeed it would be a great thing for him, as he is poor, and has no friends to help him along.\" \"Then he may stay a month on trial. You may speak to him about it.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82857.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
