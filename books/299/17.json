{"id":15543,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. — SAM LOSES HIS PLACE.","content":"\"Mr. Dalton wants you to go to the bank, and make a deposit,\" said William Budd, to Sam, on the forenoon of the same day. \"All right,\" said Sam. \"Be particularly careful, as the deposit is unusually large.\" \"Oh, yes, I\u0027ll be careful.\" Sam received the checks and drafts, amounting to several thousand dollars, and started for the Fourth National Bank, on Nassau Street. When he had accomplished a part of the distance, he met an old acquaintance, whom he had known in his boot-blacking days. \"How are you, Sam?\" said Tim Brady. \"I haven\u0027t seen you for a long time.\" \"I\u0027m all right, Tim. I haven\u0027t seen you, either. Where have you been?\" \"To Boston,\" answered Tim, briefly. \"You have!\" exclaimed Sam, interested. \"How did you like it?\" \"I don\u0027t like it as well as York.\" \"Why not? Ain\u0027t it a nice place?\" \"\u0027Tisn\u0027t half as big as York. Besides, there ain\u0027t half so much fun. There ain\u0027t no Old Bowery there, nor Tony Pastor\u0027s. I didn\u0027t know what to do with myself nights.\" \"What were you doing? Did you black boots?\" \"No,\" answered Tim. \"I was in a store on Dock Square.\" \"What sort of a store?\" \"Clothing store.\" \"How did you get the place?\" \"It is kept by a cousin of the old woman. He wrote that he\u0027d take me if I\u0027d come on. So I went; but I didn\u0027t like it.\" \"Where did you live?\" \"With him. He had a house in Chelsea, just over the river, like Brooklyn is. I got my board and a dollar a week.\" \"That ain\u0027t much,\" said Sam. \"No, I should say not. I had to pay my way over the ferry out of it, too. It didn\u0027t leave me no money for cigars nor nothing.\" \"How long were you there?\" \"About three months. I would not have stayed so long, only I couldn\u0027t get money to get back.\" \"You got it at last; or did you walk back?\" \"Walk? I guess not. It\u0027s three or four hundred miles.\" This was not quite exact, but near enough for a guess. \"How much did it cost you to come back?\" \"Five dollars.\" \"That\u0027s a good deal. Where did you get so much?\" \"I found it in the street one day,\" answered Tim, with a little hesitation. \"How long have you been back?\" \"About a week. I\u0027ve been looking round for you. Where do you hang out?\" \"I\u0027ve got a room of my own,\" answered Sam, with an air of importance. \"You have! You\u0027re in luck. What are you doin\u0027?\" \"I\u0027ve got a place with Dalton \u0026 Co., on Pearl Street.\" \"What business? \"Merchant. He\u0027s awful rich. Just look at that!\" Sam displayed his bundle of checks. \"I don\u0027t see nothin\u0027 particular except some bits of paper.\" \"You don\u0027t know anything about business, Tim. Them\u0027s checks.\" \"Are they?\" \"They\u0027re good for a lot of money. Here\u0027s a check for twelve hundred dollars, and there\u0027s others besides.\" \"That piece of paper worth twelve hundred dollars!\" said Tim, incredulously. \"Yes.\" \"What are you going to do with it?\" \"Take it to the bank.\" \"What bank?\" \"Fourth National Bank.\" Tim looked at Sam with respect. He must certainly occupy a responsible business position if he was trusted with such a large amount of money. Sam, in putting back his checks, was careless enough to drop the twelve-hundred-dollar check. He hurried off, unconscious of his loss, and Tim quietly secured it. He ought to have restored it to Sam, as he easily might have done; but an idea struck him. He would instead carry it round to Mr. Dalton, and in all probability secure a reward for his honesty. This was sharp practice, and hardly consistent with friendship for Sam; but Tim was a boy not particularly scrupulous, who cared more for number one than for any friend. He went into a store near by, ascertained the number of Mr. Dalton\u0027s place of business, and hurried down there. \"Is the boss in?\" he asked of William Budd, whom he first encountered. \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027d like to see him.\" \"What for?\" \"Important business,\" answered Tim. Budd looked at him rather incredulously. \"If you want to apply for a place, it\u0027s no use. We\u0027ve got a boy already.\" \"That ain\u0027t my business. I\u0027ve picked up something in the street that belongs to Mr. Dalton, I\u0027m thinkin\u0027.\" \"What is it?\" \"A check.\" \"Sam must have dropped it,\" thought William, instantly. \"Let me see it,\" he said, aloud. \"I\u0027ll show it to the boss,\" said Tim, obstinately. \"Come on, then.\" \"Here is a boy, Mr. Dalton, who thinks he has found something belonging to you,\" said the young man. Mr. Dalton looked up. \"What is it, my boy?\" he said. \"It\u0027s a check,\" said Tim, and, taking off his ragged hat, he handed the paper to Mr. Dalton. \"It\u0027s Nesbitt\u0027s check for twelve hundred dollars!\" exclaimed the merchant. \"Where did you find it?\" \"In Nassau Street.\" \"How could it be there, Mr. Budd?\" asked Mr. Dalton. \"I sent Sam to the bank not long since. He must have dropped it. It is not the first time he has been careless.\" \"I am afraid we shall have to discharge him. How does he perform his duties generally?\" \"Not very satisfactorily, sir.\" \"Send him to me as soon as he returns. Now, my boy, what is your name?\" \"Tim Brady, sir.\" \"Did you know the value of this check?\" \"Yes, sir; it\u0027s worth twelve hundred dollars.\" \"How did you know where to bring it?\" \"I saw the name, and looked in the \u0027Directory\u0027 to find your place of business.\" \"You are a good and honest boy.\" \"Thank you, sir; I try to be,\" said Tim, meekly. \"You have done me a service. Here are ten dollars.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Tim, joyfully. \"You\u0027re a gentleman.\" Mr. Dalton smiled. \"Always keep honest. \u0027Honesty is the best policy.\u0027\" \"I think so myself, sir,\" said Tim. Tim retired quite elated. From a corner nearly opposite he watched for Sam\u0027s return. \"He looks sober,\" said Tim to himself. \"It\u0027s likely he\u0027ll get \u0027bounced.\u0027 I wonder will I stand a chance for his place.\" \"Sam,\" said William Budd, on his entrance, \"Mr. Dalton wants to see you.\" Sam looked startled. He had ascertained his loss, and was perplexed and troubled about it. Mr. Dalton looked up as he entered. \"Have you been to the bank, Samuel?\" he asked. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Did you deposit all the checks given you?\" \"I lost one check some way,\" stammered Sam. \"You must have been very careless,\" said his employer, in a tone of reproof. \"I don\u0027t think I was,\" said Sam. \"You must have been. Did you not know that you had charge of a large amount?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Then, knowing this, you should have been particularly careful.\" \"I\u0027ll go back and look for it, sir.\" \"Fortunately there is no need of this, as it was picked up and brought here by an honest boy. It was a check for twelve hundred dollars.\" \"Then, you\u0027ve got it again?\" said Sam, relieved. \"Shall I go round to the bank and carry it?\" \"No, I shall not again trust you to go to the bank. Indeed, I am sorry to say that I cannot retain you in my employ.\" \"I hope you\u0027ll keep me,\" said Sam, alarmed. \"I cannot do it in justice to myself. Call Mr. Budd.\" William Budd entered. \"Mr. Budd,\" said Mr. Dalton, \"I think you told me you had a cousin who desired a place.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Tell him to come here to-morrow. I have discharged Sam.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"I do not forget, Sam,\" continued the merchant, \"that you once rendered me a service in bringing home my little boy. I regret that I cannot keep you in my employ. To compensate you for the disappointment, I will give you twenty-five dollars, and you are at liberty to go at once if you desire it.\" Sam\u0027s eyes sparkled with pleasure. He felt so rich that he cared little for the loss of his place. \"Thank you, sir,\" he said. \"I wish you good luck, Samuel,\" said Mr. Dalton, good-naturedly. Again Sam thanked him, and left the store looking so cheerful that Tim, who was watching for his appearance, was quite bewildered. \"He seems glad he\u0027s \u0027bounced,\u0027\" thought Tim. \"I\u0027ll go and ask him about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82844.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
