{"id":15534,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII. — TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS REWARD.","content":"Henry Martin was rather surprised at not receiving from Sam another application for a loan that evening. He had watched Sam\u0027s rate of expenditure, and decided that he must be at the bottom of his purse. He was surprised, therefore, to find that his roommate ordered an unusually expensive supper, and paid for the same out of a two-dollar bill. \"I didn\u0027t think you were so rich, Sam,\" he remarked. \"I can manage better than you think I can,\" said Sam, with an important air. \"I am glad to hear it. I want you to get along.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll get along. Here\u0027s the fifty cents I was to pay you this week.\" \"You were not to pay it till Saturday.\" \"Never mind. I\u0027ll pay it now.\" Henry Martin was surprised, but his surprise was of an agreeable character. He was convinced that Sam must have obtained money from some other quarter, but decided not to inquire about it. He would wait till Sam chose to tell him. \"Are you going back to the room, Sam?\" he inquired. \"No; I\u0027m going to the theater. Won\u0027t you go, too?\" \"No; I don\u0027t want to give up my studies.\" \"One evening won\u0027t matter.\" \"Perhaps not, but I will wait till some other time.\" \"You must have a sweet time working all day, and studying all night,\" said Sam, rather contemptuously. \"Not quite all night,\" answered Henry, smiling. \"You don\u0027t take any time for amusement.\" \"I am looking forward to the future. I want to rise in the world.\" \"So do I; but I ain\u0027t going to kill myself with work.\" \"I don\u0027t think you ever will, Sam. I\u0027ll be willing to insure you from dying in that way.\" Sam laughed. \"I guess you\u0027re right there,\" he said. \"Well, if you won\u0027t go, I\u0027ll leave you. I s\u0027pose you\u0027ll be asleep when I get home, so good-night.\" \"Good-night, Sam,\" said Henry, good-humoredly. \"I wonder how soon he\u0027ll be wanting to borrow money again?\" he thought. The next morning, when Sam reached the office, he found William Budd glancing at the Herald. \"You are late,\" said the young clerk. \"I was out late last evening,\" said Sam, apologetically. \"At a fashionable party, I suppose?\" \"Not exactly. I was at the theater.\" \"I thought you were out of money yesterday.\" \"Oh, I raised a little.\" \"It seems to me you are rather extravagant for your means.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll come out right,\" said Sam, carelessly. \"By the way, you haven\u0027t found a diamond ring, have you?\" asked Budd, his eyes fixed upon the paper. Sam was startled, but his fellow clerk was scanning the paper, and did not observe his embarrassment. \"What makes you ask that?\" Sam inquired. \"Nothing; only you\u0027d be in luck if you did.\" \"Why would I?\" \"Here\u0027s an advertisement from a man who has lost such a ring, offering twenty-five dollars reward to the finder.\" \"Twenty-five dollars!\" ejaculated Sam, in excitement. \"Does he say where he lost it?\" \"Supposed to have been lost in Wall Street.\" \"Wall Street!\" repeated Sam. \"It must be the one I found,\" he thought. \"Yes; I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s much chance of his getting it back again.\" \"Let me see the advertisement,\" said Sam. \"There it is,\" said Budd, handing him the paper. Sam read it carefully, and impressed the address upon his memory—No. 49 Wall Street. The advertiser was John Chester. \"Are you going out to look for it?\" asked William, in joke. \"I guess there wouldn\u0027t be much show for me. Probably somebody has picked it up already.\" \"No doubt.\" \"Shall I go to the post office?\" \"Of course not till after you have swept the office. Did you expect me to do that?\" Sam probably never swept so quickly before. He was anxious to get out, and see what chance he had of earning the twenty-five dollars, for he was convinced that the ring advertised for was the one he had found. He was provoked to think he had been so quick in pawning it. If he only had it in his possession now he would have nothing to do but to call on Mr. Chester and receive twenty-five dollars. With that amount he would feel as rich as a millionaire. Now the problem was to get hold of the ring, and this, in Sam\u0027s circumstances, was not an easy problem to solve. Of the five dollars he had received from the pawnbroker he had but three left, and it was idle to expect to recover it unless he should pay the full price and the commission besides. \"What shall I do?\" thought Sam, perplexed. \"Here is a chance to make twenty dollars extra if I only had three dollars more.\" A bright idea dawned upon him. If he would only get his week\u0027s wages in advance he would be able to manage. He would broach the subject. \"Do you think, Mr. Budd, Mr. Dalton would be willing to pay me my week\u0027s wages to-day instead of Saturday?\" he inquired. \"I know he wouldn\u0027t. It\u0027s contrary to his rule.\" \"But it is important for me to have the money to-day,\" pleaded Sam. \"Don\u0027t you think he would do it if I told him that?\" Budd shook his head. \"It wouldn\u0027t be a good plan to ask him,\" he said. \"He would conclude that you were living beyond your means, and that he doesn\u0027t like.\" \"Couldn\u0027t you lend me the money?\" asked Sam. \"I told you yesterday I couldn\u0027t, that is, I am not willing to. I don\u0027t approve of the way you spend your money.\" \"It\u0027s only for this time,\" said Sam. \"I\u0027ll never ask you again.\" \"I may as well be frank with you,\" said the young man. \"If you were economical, and were short o money from sickness, or any other cause which you could not control, I would say \u0027Yes\u0027; but while you complain of your salary as insufficient, you play billiards, and spend the evening at the theater; and these things I don\u0027t approve. I didn\u0027t do that when I was in your position. How do I know but you want your money in advance to spend in the same way?\" \"I don\u0027t,\" said Sam. \"What do you want of it, then?\" \"The fact is,\" said Sam, \"it\u0027s to get something out of the pawnbroker\u0027s.\" \"What is it?\" \"It\u0027s—a coat,\" said Sam, forced to tell a lie. \"When did you pledge it?\" \"Yesterday.\" \"And you spent the money going to the theater,\" said Budd, sarcastically. \"Yes,\" said Sam, confused. \"Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\" \"I won\u0027t do it again, if you will lend me money to get it out.\" \"You can wait till Saturday, when you receive your wages. You have a coat on, and certainly cannot need the other. I didn\u0027t know that you had another, by the way.\" Sam was beginning to see that he had only got himself into a scrape by his false statement, and he did not know how to extricate himself. \"I need it before Saturday,\" he said. \"Why do you? Won\u0027t this do?\" \"The fact is,\" said Sam, \"there\u0027s a fellow wants to buy it from me, and he wants it to-day, or he won\u0027t take it.\" \"Why do you want to sell your clothes, Sam?\" \"Because I need the money.\" \"It seems to me you are managing very poorly. Rather than economize, you pawn your coat, and then try to sell it. So you are continually getting yourself into trouble.\" \"I know it,\" said Sam, \"but I don\u0027t mean to do it again.\" \"If you\u0027ll take my advice you will leave your coat where it is till you are able to redeem it. Don\u0027t think of selling it, for a new one would cost you more than you will get for it.\" This advice was good, but it did not apply to Sam\u0027s case, since he had no coat to pawn. It will easily be understood, therefore, that it proved unsatisfactory to him. He didn\u0027t reply, but finished his sweeping, and then, putting on his hat, he went to the post office for letters. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82835.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
