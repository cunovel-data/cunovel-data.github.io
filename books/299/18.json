{"id":15544,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. — TIM IS UNMASKED.","content":"Before Sam had gone far Tim Brady managed to throw himself in his way. \"Where are you goin\u0027, now?\" he asked. \"Have you been to the bank?\" \"Yes,\" answered Sam. \"I lost one of them checks.\" \"You don\u0027t say!\" said hypocritical Tim. \"It was the twelve-hundred-dollar one.\" \"What did the boss say? Did he blow you up?\" inquired Tim, puzzled by Sam\u0027s cheerful manner. \"Yes; I\u0027m \u0027bounced.\u0027\" \"You don\u0027t seem to care much,\" said Tim, watching him curiously. \"No, I don\u0027t. I\u0027m tired of the old place.\" \"What are you goin\u0027 to do? Are you goin\u0027 back to boot blackin\u0027?\" \"No,\" answered Sam, scornfully; \"I should say not.\" \"You ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to retire on a fortune, are you?\" \"Look here, Tim,\" said Sam, displaying a roll of bills. \"What do you say to that?\" \"Did you save all that?\" asked Tim, in great astonishment. \"No; Mr. Dalton just gave it to me.\" \"Give it to you when he \u0027bounced\u0027 you?\" \"Yes; you see, I found his little boy in the street one day, and took him home. He give me a place for that, and now that I\u0027m sacked he\u0027s give me this money.\" \"I say, Sam, you\u0027re in luck. How much is there?\" \"Twenty-five dollars.\" \"You couldn\u0027t lend a feller five dollars?\" said Tim, insinuatingly. \"Yes, I could,\" answered Sam, cooly; \"but I won\u0027t.\" \"Why not?\" \"I want it all myself.\" \"You might let me have a little,\" pleaded Tim. \"I\u0027ll give you a square meal,\" said Sam, \"but I can\u0027t do no more. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to Boston.\" \"What\u0027s put in into your head to go to Boston?\" \"You have.\" \"Well, I hope you\u0027ll like it better than I do.\" \"Which way would you go?\" asked Sam. \"Fall River line. They\u0027re got nice steamers.\" \"When do they go?\" \"Five o\u0027clock.\" \"All right. I\u0027ll go this afternoon.\" \"You\u0027ll be comin\u0027 back soon,\" said Tim. \"Maybe I will, but I want to see the place. I ain\u0027t never traveled much, and now I\u0027m goin\u0027.\" \"You\u0027d better stay, and take me to Tony Pastor\u0027s to-night.\" Sam shook his head. \"Oh, yes, you\u0027d like me to spend all my money on you; but I don\u0027t see it.\" \"You needn\u0027t be so afraid. I\u0027ve got some money, too,\" said Tim, nettled. \"You\u0027ve got fifty cents, I s\u0027pose.\" \"Does that look like fifty cents?\" Tim displayed the ten dollars he had received from Mr. Dalton for restoring the lost check. Sam was astonished beyond measure. \"Where did you get that money?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s some I had over when I failed,\" \"And with all that money in your pocket you asked me for five dollars!\" exclaimed Sam, with justifiable indignation. \"Why shouldn\u0027t I? Haven\u0027t you got more than I have?\" Tim began to see that he had made a mistake in proclaiming his riches; especially when Sam added that he might buy his own dinner—that he wasn\u0027t going to treat him. \"You promised you would,\" said Tim. \"I didn\u0027t know you had so much money. I thought you was hard up. You\u0027re a fraud.\" \"So are you,\" said Tim, resentfully. \"I don\u0027t want no more to do with you.\" Tim was nettled. He wanted to be revenged, and his secret slipped out. \"You needn\u0027t feel so big,\" he said. \"I got you \u0027bounced.\u0027\" Here was much cause for astonishment. \"You got me \u0027bounced\u0027?\" repeated Sam, in surprise. \"Yes, I did. I found that check you dropped, and took it round to your boss. He give me this ten dollars, and \u0027bounced\u0027 you.\" This was too much for Sam\u0027s equanimity. That a boy who had so injured him should try to wheedle money and a treat out of him struck him as so atrocious, that he felt action to be imperative. A sudden movement of the foot upset Tim; and Sam, without waiting to see how he relished his downfall, fled round a corner before Tim could retaliate. \"He\u0027s the meanest boy I ever knew!\" thought our retreating hero. \"He got me sacked, and then wanted me to treat him. I guess he won\u0027t ask me again.\" Sam was still determined to go to Boston that afternoon. Before he went he wanted to say good-by to Henry Martin, and, as the boat would sail before business hours was over, he decided to go round to the store where he was employed. Henry was just leaving the store on an errand when Sam came up. It was the first time they had met since Henry\u0027s discovery of Sam\u0027s attempt to appropriate his savings. He could hardly be expected to feel very friendly toward him. \"I\u0027ll walk along with you, Henry,\" said Sam; \"I want to talk with you.\" \"And I want to talk with you,\" said Henry, coldly. \"I\u0027ve found out all about my bankbook.\" \"Have you?\" replied Sam, disconcerted. \"Yes; I\u0027ve found out that you opened my trunk and took it out, then went to the bank and tried to get twenty dollars on it. And all the while you were rooming with me, and pretending to be my friend.\" Sam felt conscience-stricken. The enormity of his act flashed upon him. Still, he wanted to extenuate his conduct. \"It\u0027s true, Henry,\" he admitted, \"and I ought to be ashamed of myself. But I didn\u0027t get any money, after all, and I returned the book to you.\" \"I know that; but it was only because they wouldn\u0027t let you have anything on it.\" \"Don\u0027t think too hard of me, Henry,\" said Sam. \"I can\u0027t help thinking hard of you. You wanted to rob me.\" \"I only wanted to borrow the money.\" \"Without my leave.\" \"I meant to return it to you as soon as I could. The fact is, Henry, I was awful hard up.\" \"That\u0027s your own fault. As for returning the money, I hope you don\u0027t think me quite such a fool as to believe that.\" Sam was really disturbed. He saw that Henry was perfectly justified in being angry, and that his representation was the correct one. \"I\u0027m very sorry I did it,\" he said. \"I hope you\u0027ll forgive me.\" \"I\u0027ll forgive you, but we can no longer occupy the same room. I will move out and leave the room to you, or you can move out and leave the room to me.\" \"I\u0027ll move, Henry. That\u0027s what I came to speak to you about. I came to bid you good-by.\" \"There is no need of saying good-by. We shall see each other again.\" \"No, we shan\u0027t—for a good while, anyway. I\u0027m just goin\u0027 to Boston.\" \"What?\" exclaimed Henry in astonishment. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 on this afternoon.\" \"Why, Sam, what\u0027s up?\" Sam explained. \"I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s a good plan,\" said Henry, when he had ended. \"Nor I,\" said Sam; \"but I\u0027m goin\u0027, anyway. If I don\u0027t like it, I\u0027ll come back somehow. Good-by!\" \"Good-by, and good luck, Sam!\" said Henry, offering his hand. \"Sam\u0027s a strange boy!\" he said to himself, as he pursued his way alone. \"It\u0027s hard to tell how he\u0027s coming out. I hope he\u0027ll get wiser as he grows older.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82845.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
