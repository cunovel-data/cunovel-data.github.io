{"id":15553,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. — ABNER BLODGETT AGAIN.","content":"The next day in his wanderings Sam entered the Parker House. He had no definite object in view, but, feeling tired, thought he would sit down a few minutes in the reading-room. \"This is where that fellow roped me in,\" he thought. \"I wish I could get hold of him.\" After sitting for quarter of an hour, he strolled downstairs into the billiard room. He stood on the threshold for a moment, when a familiar voice struck his ear. His heart beat rapidly with excitement, for he recognized it as the voice of Abner Blodgett. He glanced eagerly about to find him, but he could see no one resembling the young man from the country who had victimized him. \"I don\u0027t believe two voices can be so much alike,\" he said to himself. \"I must look more carefully.\" The voice was heard again, and this time Sam perceived that the speaker was playing billiards on the second table to the right. But it did not appear to be Abner. His personal appearance was very different, and he had a black mustache. But when Sam scanned the upper part of the face, he saw a strong resemblance. He suspected the truth at once, Abner was disguised. \"He\u0027s spending my money,\" said Sam to himself, indignantly. \"No wonder he can afford to play billiards when he gets his money so easy. I won\u0027t lose sight of him.\" By this time Abner—for it was he—had finished his game, and laid down his cue. He had no money to pay, for he had beaten his adversary. He sauntered up to the door, and was about to pass Sam, whom he had not noticed, when our hero laid his hand upon his arm. \"I want to speak to you, Mr. Blodgett,\" he said, \"on very particular business.\" Abner started when he recognized Sam, and changed color slightly, but immediately his disguise occurred to him, and he decided to brazen it out. \"Excuse me, sir,\" he answered, coolly. \"Did you address me?\" He changed his voice as well as he could in uttering these words, and this confirmed Sam\u0027s previous suspicion. \"I said I should like to speak to you on business, Mr. Blodgett,\" Sam repeated, in an emphatic tone. \"You have made a mistake in the person,\" said Abner, shrugging his shoulders. \"My name is not Blodgett.\" \"And I suppose your first name is not Abner?\" said Sam. \"Certainly not.\" \"Well, all I can say is, you have changed your name within two days.\" \"Come out into the street, and I will talk to you,\" said Abner, not wishing the conversation to be heard. Sam followed him upstairs, and they went into School Street together. \"What did you say my name was?\" asked Abner, with an air of amusement. \"Abner Blodgett.\" \"Ha, ha! that\u0027s a capital joke—the best I\u0027ve heard lately.\" \"You told me you were from the country,\" Sam continued. \"Really, I should think you must be from the country yourself, to make such a mistake.\" \"I am from the city of New York, if you call that the country,\" said Sam, in rather an important tone. \"I am sorry for you, but you\u0027ve made a great mistake about me, my dear young friend. My name is John Warburton, and I am a student of Harvard College, in Cambridge. I only just came into Boston this morning. I haven\u0027t been here before for a week.\" He spoke so volubly and confidently that Sam was staggered for a minute. Was it possible that he was mistaken, after all? Was this really a Harvard student, whose voice happened to resemble that of Abner Blodgett? Abner saw that he was mystified, and a gleam of exultation appeared in his face. When Sam detected this, he felt sure that he had got the right man, after all. Abner even ventured to ask: \"Why do you wish to see this Abner Blodgett, whom I have the honor of resembling?\" \"Because,\" said Sam, bluntly, \"he stole my money.\" \"Stole your money!\" repeated Abner, with mock indignation. \"Do you dare to take me for a thief—me, a Harvard student, belonging to one of the first families! Why, it is an insult and an outrage! I have a great mind to chastise you.\" \"I don\u0027t know whether you belong to one of the first or one of the second families,\" answered Sam, unterrified; \"and I don\u0027t believe you are a Harvard student at all. Just give me back them ten dollars you stole out of my pocket or I\u0027ll make it hot for you.\" \"You young scamp!\" said Abner, now really angry; \"you\u0027ve insulted me long enough. Now, clear out, or I\u0027ll kick you!\" \"Kick away,\" said Sam; \"but first give me my money.\" \"This is an outrage,\" said Abner, who noticed the approach of a policeman; \"but if you are really in want I\u0027ll give you fifty cents, though you don\u0027t deserve it.\" \"I don\u0027t want your fifty cents, I want the money you stole from me,\" persisted Sam, who was not to be bought so cheap. \"For Heaven\u0027s sake, hush!\" said Abner, nervously. \"One of the professors is inside, and I am afraid he\u0027ll come out and hear you. Here\u0027s the fifty cents.\" \"That won\u0027t go down, Mr. Blodgett,\" said Sam. \"How much of my money have you got left?\" By this time the policeman was within hearing distance. Sam saw him now, and determined to press his claim vigorously. \"I\u0027ll complain to that policeman,\" he said, \"if you don\u0027t give up my money.\" \"Hush!\" said Abner. \"Wait till he goes by, and we\u0027ll arrange it.\" \"No, we won\u0027t,\" said Sam, stoutly. \"Do you want me to call him?\" The policeman was now passing them. He glanced casually at the pair, rather to the discomfort of Abner, whose face was not wholly unknown to the force. \"What do you say?\" demanded Sam, in a significant tone. \"I\u0027ll lend you five dollars,\" said Abner, desperately. \"It\u0027s all I\u0027ve got now.\" \"Hand it over, then,\" said Sam, who had not expected to get back so much of the stolen property. Abner drew out a bill from his pocket, and passed it over. \"Is that all you\u0027ve got left, Mr. Blodgett?\" asked Sam. \"Don\u0027t call me Blodgett. It isn\u0027t my name. I told you my name was John Wharton, of Harvard College.\" \"You said Warburton five minutes since,\" said Sam, dryly. \"You didn\u0027t understand me,\" said Abner, rather embarrassed. \"The names sound alike.\" \"I don\u0027t believe any of the names belong to you. Now, when are you going to pay the rest of that money?\" \"I told you I knew nothing of your money,\" said Abner. \"Then why did you give me that five dollars back?\" \"Out of charity.\" \"Then I wish you\u0027d give me a little more out of charity.\" \"I have only enough to get me back to Cambridge.\" \"By the way, Mr. Blodgett,\" said Sam, slyly, \"what do you use to make your mustache grow so quick?\" \"Nothing at all. What makes you ask?\" \"When I saw you two days ago you had none. It\u0027s grown pretty well for so short a time.\" \"I can\u0027t stop talking with you any longer. I must go out to Cambridge. I have a recitation in Latin in two hours.\" \"May I go out with you? I would like to see the college.\" \"Can\u0027t see it to-day,\" said Abner. \"It isn\u0027t open to the public on Saturday.\" \"That\u0027s strange. I can go to Cambridge, can\u0027t I?\" \"If you want to; but there isn\u0027t anything to see except the college.\" \"He don\u0027t want me to find him out,\" thought Sam. \"I\u0027m bound to go if he goes.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll go,\" he said, quietly. \"Come along.\" Abner unwillingly started with his unwelcome companion, and walked slowly to Bowdoin Square. \"There\u0027s the cars,\" he said, \"just in front of the Revere House. Jump in, and I\u0027ll be with you in a minute.\" As he said this he dodged round a corner and Sam found himself alone. \"Just as I expected,\" thought he. \"That fellow isn\u0027t a Harvard student any more than I am. I\u0027m lucky to get back part of my money. Perhaps I\u0027ll get the rest out of him some time.\" He got into the car which had been pointed out to him and inquired of the driver: \"Does this car go to Harvard College?\" \"It is a Mount Auburn car, but you can get out at Harvard Square.\" \"I guess it\u0027s all right,\" said Sam to himself. \"I might as well go out and see Harvard, as I\u0027ve got nothing else to do.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82854.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
