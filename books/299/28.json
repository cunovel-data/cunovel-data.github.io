{"id":15554,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. — SAM IS INITIATED INTO A COLLEGE SOCIETY.","content":"Before Sam reached Harvard Square he caught sight of the college yard and the numerous buildings of brick and stone which had been erected within it for the accommodations of the students. \"It\u0027s a pretty big place,\" thought Sam. His ideas of a college were very vague. He had fancied that it consisted of one large brick building, like the New York public schools. \"I wonder what they want of so many buildings, anyway?\" said Sam to himself. \"There must be a lot of students.\" He got out at Harvard Square, and crossing the street entered the college yard, or campus, as it is sometimes more ambitiously called. There were very few students about, for it was Saturday, when there was a morning exercise only, and, the rest of the day being a holiday, many of the students were accustomed to go to Boston, or to visit their friends elsewhere. Sam knew nothing of this, and was surprised to see so few young men about. Now it happened that three sophomores, having nothing more important to occupy their attention, had made up their minds, by way of a lark, to play a trick on some freshman, who, from inexperience, looked like an easy victim. For convenience\u0027s sake I will call them Brown, Jones and Robinson. As these three young men were walking arm-in-arm in front of University Hall, they saw Sam approaching. Of course, where the classes are so large, it is impossible for all to be personally acquainted, which accounts for their instantly mistaking Sam for a freshman. \"There\u0027s a fresh,\" said Brown. \"He looks green enough for our purpose. Suppose we take him?\" \"All right,\" said Jones. \"He\u0027ll do.\" Sam was rather surprised when the three college boys stopped and Brown addressed him. \"What is your name, sir?\" \"Barker,\" answered Sam. \"All right!\" said Robinson, in a low voice. \"There\u0027s a Barker in the freshman class. I\u0027ve noticed his name in the catalogue.\" \"I believe, Mr. Barker,\" said Brown, \"that you belong to the freshman class.\" \"That\u0027s a good joke,\" said Sam to himself. \"I\u0027ll see it through.\" He was not a little flattered at being mistaken for a collegian, and nodded assent. \"We have heard of you, Mr. Barker,\" said Jones, in the most favorable manner. \"We belong to the senior class, and at our last meeting we elected you unanimously a member of the Alpha Zeta Society.\" \"You don\u0027t say so!\" exclaimed Sam, really astonished. \"We have inquired of the faculty concerning your scholarship, and have been told that you are one of the best scholars in the class.\" \"If that\u0027s so,\" thought Sam, \"the class don\u0027t know much.\" \"There are plenty that know more than me,\" said Sam, aloud. \"All your modesty, Mr. Barker,\" said Robinson. \"We are convinced that you are a first-class man, and will be an acquisition to our society.\" \"What does it all mean?\" Sam began to wonder. \"We are a committee of the society appointed to initiate you by the usual impressive ceremonies,\" said Brown. \"It is very fortunate we have met with you, for Saturday is our day for initiations.\" \"Is it?\" \"Yes; have you any particular engagement for the next hour?\" \"Not as I know of.\" \"Then we will at once proceed to the society room and take you to the initiation. Are you ready?\" \"I haven\u0027t made my will yet,\" said Sam, humorously. The three sophomores looked at each other doubtfully. Perhaps their intended butt was not as verdant as they supposed. \"That formality is not necessary,\" said Jones, after a pause, \"unless you desire to leave any money to the society.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll join first, and see how I like it,\" said Sam. \"Quite reasonable,\" said Brown, in a tone of satisfaction. \"We\u0027d better not lose any time,\" said Robinson. \"Follow us, Mr. Barker,\" said Brown. \"All right, gentlemen.\" Robinson offered his arm, and the four proceeded to one of the older college halls, and ascended to a room on the third floor. \"Ain\u0027t they sold, though!\" thought Sam, with an inward chuckle. \"They think I\u0027m a student, and I\u0027ll find out all about their society—I can\u0027t think of the outlandish name.\" The door was locked, and then Brown said: \"Mr. Barker, you will not object to be blindfolded, of course.\" \"Go ahead,\" said Sam. \"If that\u0027s the regular thing, I\u0027m agreeable.\" He was blindfolded by Brown and seated in the center of the room. He heard various movements, lasting for perhaps five minutes. Then the bandage was removed, and Sam saw that his three companions were metamorphosed. All wore masks. The light of day had been shut out, and four candles were burning on the table. In the center was a skull, and beside it was a large book, a photograph book, by the way. \"Barker,\" said one of the masked figures in a sepulchral voice, \"do you desire to join our mystic band?\" \"You bet!\" answered Sam. \"No levity,\" was the stern reply. \"Before you are admitted you must swear solemnly not to divulge the secrets of the association.\" \"I won\u0027t,\" said Sam. \"\u0027Tis not enough. You must swear!\" \"All right, I swear.\" \"Kiss this book, and swear with uplifted hand.\" Sam did so. \"Do you know what will be the penalty if you violate the oath?\" \"I\u0027ll be \u0027bounced,\u0027 I expect.\" \"Worse than that. Do you see this skull?\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"It is the skull of a freshman who joined our society five years since, and divulged the secrets.\" \"What did he die of?\" asked Sam. \"He disappeared,\" said Brown, impressively. \"He was found dead in his bed one morning, with a dagger in his heart.\" \"You don\u0027t say so!\" said Sam, impressed in spite of himself. \"It was a fitting punishment. Don\u0027t incur it.\" \"I won\u0027t,\" said Sam. \"I don\u0027t know anything to tell anyway.\" \"You shall know all. Our society was founded hundreds of years ago by the emperor Charlemagne.\" This didn\u0027t impress Sam as much as was expected, since he had never heard of the Emperor Charlemagne. \"Kings, nobles, prime ministers have belonged to our mystic ranks,\" proceeded Brown. \"Then I wonder they elected me in?\" thought Sam. \"That book,\" indicating the photograph album, \"contains the records of the society.\" \"May I look into it?\" \"No,\" said Jones, hurriedly, laying his hand upon the book. \"The time may come, but not yet.\" \"Just as you say,\" said Sam, submissively. \"I\u0027m in no hurry.\" \"Bandage his eyes once more,\" said Brown. Robinson advanced, and tied a handkerchief over our hero\u0027s eyes. \"Now stand up.\" Sam stood up. Brown proceeded to read a chorus from Euripides, which impressed Sam as much as anything yet, for the Greek seemed but a strange and barbarous jargon to his unaccustomed ears. \"Do you understand what I have said?\" asked Brown, at the close of his reading. \"Not entirely,\" said Sam, \"Then your education has been neglected. But it matters not. Raise him.\" Jones and Robinson proceeded to lift Sam, one by the head, the other by the heels, rather to his alarm. \"What\u0027s your game?\" he demanded, resisting. \"No harm is intended. It is one of the necessary formalities.\" \"Go ahead, then.\" The two students bore Sam about the room, chanting discordantly as they went. At length they set him down again in a chair. Then Brown passed his hand several times over Sam\u0027s face, explaining that this was one of the necessary formalities also. Then the bandage was taken off, and a Greek book was handed to Sam. \"We will test your scholarship,\" said Brown. \"Read.\" Sam stared at the Greek page in bewilderment, turning the book upside down, but not finding it any more intelligible. \"I can\u0027t read this stuff,\" he said. \"You need not render it into English,\" said Brown. \"Pronounce it in the original.\" \"I can\u0027t,\" said Sam, helplessly. The three looked at each other. \"You can\u0027t read Greek?\" said Brown. \"Of course I can\u0027t.\" \"Then how did you get into college?\" \"I walked in.\" \"I mean, how could you be admitted without knowing Greek?\" \"I wasn\u0027t admitted. I never was here in my life before.\" \"What! Are you not Barker, of the freshman class?\" asked the three sophomores in chorus. \"My name is Barker—Sam Barker—but I don\u0027t belong to any class.\" \"What made you say you did?\" \"Just for fun.\" \"Sold!\" exclaimed the three in concert. \"I guess this has gone far enough,\" said Brown. \"Let\u0027s unmask.\" Masks were removed, the curtains raised, Sam was invited to wash his face, which Brown, in his manipulations, had blacked, and there was a hearty laugh all round. Sam was invited to tell his story and did so. The three students were wealthy, and took up a contribution for his benefit, amounting to ten dollars. \"I\u0027ll come round another day for half price,\" said Sam, humorously. \"The next time we initiate a freshman, it\u0027ll be the genuine article. All the same, we\u0027ve had some fun. Won\u0027t you stay and dine with us? We shall have dinner in an hour.\" \"Thank you,\" said Sam, \"I\u0027m agreeable.\" \"We\u0027ll take you round to see the college before dinner. We can\u0027t do less by a member of the Alpha Zeta Society.\" Sam laughed. \"I guess you\u0027ll have to put down the name on a piece of paper,\" he said, \"or I\u0027ll forget what society I belong to.\" Sam\u0027s good humor and droll observations made him a favorite with the three students. He learned, to his surprise, that Brown was a cousin of Julia Stockton, whose acquaintance he had made on the Fall River boat. \"I was in town yesterday, and Julia mentioned you—said you were very polite to her. It is very strange we should run across each other so soon after.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" said Sam, and, calling to mind the ten dollars in his pocket, he could not help adding to himself: \"It\u0027s mighty lucky, too.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82855.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
