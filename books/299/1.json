{"id":15527,"no":1,"title":"PREFACE.","content":"\"Sam\u0027s Chance\" is a sequel to the \"Young Outlaw,\" and is designed to illustrate the gradual steps by which that young man was induced to give up his bad habits, and deserve that prosperity which he finally attains. The writer confesses to have experienced some embarrassment in writing this story. The story writer always has at command expedients by which the frowns of fortune may be turned into sunshine, and this without violating probability, or, at any rate, possibility; for the careers of many of our most eminent and successful men attest that truth is often-times stranger than fiction. But to cure a boy of radical faults is almost as difficult in fiction as in real life. Whether the influences which led to Sam\u0027s reformation were adequate to that result, must be decided by the critical reader. The author may, at any rate, venture to congratulate Sam\u0027s friends that he is now more worthy of their interest and regard than in the years when he was known as the \"Young Outlaw.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82828.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
