{"id":15547,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XX. — TOO LATE FOR THE TRAIN.","content":"A stateroom had been engaged for Julia, but Sam did not feel justified in paying a dollar extra for such a luxury, when he was already entitled to a comfortable berth. \"Do you know when we reach Fall River?\" asked the young lady. \"About half-past four in the morning, and the cars start by five.\" \"That\u0027s awful early!\" exclaimed Julia, in dismay. \"How shall I wake up in time?\" \"The gong will sound,\" answered Sam; \"but if that don\u0027t wake you, I\u0027ll pound on your door.\" \"I wish you would. What should I do if I were left?\" \"You could wait for the next train.\" \"But I should not have you to go with me, Sam—Mr. Barker, I mean.\" \"I wish you would call me Sam. I like it better than Mr. Barker.\" \"Then I will,\" said Julia, frankly. \"It does seem stiff to call you Mr. Barker.\" \"If you should be too late for the first train, I will wait, too,\" said Sam, answering what she had said before. \"Will you? I should like that; but won\u0027t it put you out?\" \"Oh, no,\" said Sam, laughing; \"there isn\u0027t any very important business to call me early to Boston. I had just as lieve wait as not.\" \"But you won\u0027t have to. I am sure the gong will wake me up. But you\u0027ll come to the door, and go into the cars with me.\" \"Oh, yes, I\u0027ll be on hand.\" \"Then, good-night, Sam. I hope you\u0027ll have a good sleep.\" \"I shall sleep like a top; I always do. Good-night, Julia.\" So they parted. \"He seems to be a real nice boy, and very polite,\" thought Julia. \"I should feel very lonely without him.\" \"She\u0027s a tiptop girl,\" thought Sam. \"I never saw one I liked so well before.\" Sam had never had a sister, and his acquaintance with girls had been exceedingly limited. This was necessarily the case in the rough street life he had led in New York. Julia was a new revelation to him. He was quite too young to be in love, but he certainly liked Julia very much, and thought how pleasant it would be to have such a sister. \"She says she\u0027s got a brother,\" thought Sam. \"I wonder what sort of a boy he is, and whether he will like me? I suppose I never shall see him though, or Julia either, after we get to Boston.\" This thought was rather disheartening, and made Sam feel sober. But he brightened up at the thought that he should be in the same city, and should, therefore, have some chance of meeting his pretty traveling acquaintance. The berth Sam was to occupy was on one side of the dining-room. The tables were now cleared, and there was nothing to prevent his retiring. He took off his shoes and his coat, and, without undressing himself any further, got into the berth. It was not long before he was asleep. He did not wake until morning, and then not voluntarily. On opening his eyes he saw one of the attendants on the boat at his bedside. \"You must sleep pretty sound,\" said the attendant. \"Did you wake me up?\" asked Sam. \"Yes; but I had hard work to do it.\" \"Is it time to get up?\" \"I should think it was. Didn\u0027t you hear the gong?\" \"No.\" \"It sounded loud enough. Well, you\u0027d better hurry, or you\u0027ll be too late for the cars.\" This roused Sam. He thought of Julia, and jumped out of the birth. He quickly put on his coat and shoes, and went up two flights of stairs to the saloon, on either side of which were the staterooms. He went to Julia\u0027s—No. 11—near the forward end of the boat, and found the door shut. He knocked, but was not immediately answered. \"Julia must have overslept herself, too,\" he thought. He knocked again, and presently he heard her ask, in the tone of one just waking up, \"Who\u0027s there?\" \"It\u0027s I—it\u0027s Sam,\" he answered. \"Are you dressed?\" \"No. What time is it?\" \"It\u0027s very late. Didn\u0027t you hear the gong?\" \"No; is it morning?\" \"The cars are almost ready to start.\" \"Oh, dear; what shall I do?\" exclaimed Julia, in dismay. \"Dress as quick as you can, and we may be in time.\" After the lapse of five minutes the door opened, and the young lady appeared. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Sam,\" she said, excusing herself. \"Shall we be in time?\" \"We\u0027ll go down and see,\" said Sam. They went below, and out over the gangway, but were only just in time to see the long train speeding on its way. \"We are left!\" said Julia, mournfully. \"Well,\" said Sam, philosophically, \"it can\u0027t be helped, can it?\" \"Shall we have to stay here all day?\" inquired the young lady, alarmed. \"Oh, no; there is another train at half-past six, but it is a slower train than this.\" \"When will it reach Boston?\" \"At nine o\u0027clock. I asked the steward just now. It won\u0027t make very much difference. We\u0027ll get to the city pretty early.\" \"Father will be down to the depot, and when he doesn\u0027t see me he\u0027ll think I am not coming. Then how am I to get home?\" \"I\u0027ll be with you,\" said Sam, valiantly. \"I\u0027ll see that you get home all right.\" \"Will you?\" said Julia, brightly. \"Then I don\u0027t mind so much. How stupid I was not to wake up!\" \"I didn\u0027t wake up either. One of the men woke me up. I ran up as quick as I could, but it was too late.\" \"I got very tired yesterday,\" said Julia, apologetically. \"That was what made me sleep so sound. When did you say the next train went?\" \"At six-thirty.\" \"What shall we do till then?\" \"You can lie down if you want to, and I will call you in time.\" \"I don\u0027t dare to,\" said Julia. \"Besides, I don\u0027t feel sleepy now.\" They decided to sit down and while away the time, and were not at a loss for topics of conversation. At half-past six they had taken their places in the cars, in the full anticipation of a pleasant journey.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82848.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
