{"id":15536,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX. — RESTORING THE RING.","content":"\"Now,\" said Henry, \"we had better go down to Wall Street and see the advertiser at once. If we can restore the ring to-night we shall avoid the risk of losing it.\" \"What makes you say we?\" asked Sam, uneasily. \"You don\u0027t expect any of the reward, do you?\" \"I only expect you to pay me back what you owe me, Sam. The ring was found by you, and you are entitled to the reward.\" Sam looked relieved. \"Of course I\u0027ll pay you all I owe you, as soon as I get the twenty-five dollars,\" he said. \"Have you got the advertisement? Can you tell the name and number of the advertiser?\" \"Yes, his name is John Chester, and his office is at No. 49 Wall Street.\" \"Good. We must go down directly, or he will be gone.\" The boys hurried to the office, which was on the third floor of the building. A young man, of eighteen or nineteen, was in sole possession. It may be remarked, by the way, that Mr. Chester was a lawyer, and this young man had just entered the office as student. \"That can\u0027t be Mr. Chester,\" said Henry, in a low voice, as the young man turned upon their entrance, and fixed his eyes inquiringly upon them. \"I\u0027ll ask,\" said Sam. \"Are you Mr. Chester?\" he inquired. The youth looked flattered at being mistaken for his employer. \"Mr. Chester has gone home,\" he answered, consequentially; \"but, perhaps, I can do well. Do you come on business?\" \"Yes,\" said Sam. \"Ahem! law business, I suppose,\" said the lawyer\u0027s assistant, looking wise. \"State your case, and I may be able to assist you. Is it a case of trespass, or do you wish to obtain a habeas corpus, or a caveat, or a nisi prius?\" \"What a lot he knows!\" thought Sam, respectfully. \"I don\u0027t want none of those things.\" \"Perhaps you want to obtain a divorce,\" said the budding barrister, in a jocular tone. \"I am afraid we can\u0027t manage that for you.\" \"We want to see Mr. Chester on particular business,\" said Henry Martin. \"Well, you can\u0027t see him to-night. He\u0027s gone home.\" \"Where does he live?\" \"He don\u0027t see clients at his house. It won\u0027t be any use going there.\" \"I guess he\u0027ll see us. We\u0027ll take the risk.\" \"What is your business about?\" asked the young man, with curiosity. \"It\u0027s private,\" said Henry. \"Very important, no doubt,\" said the disappointed neophyte. \"Mr. Chester will think so,\" said Sam. \"Where did you say he lived?\" \"Did you come about the ring?\" asked the young man, with a sudden thought. \"What ring?\" asked Sam, cunningly. \"Mr. Chester lost a ring in Wall Street yesterday and advertised it in the Herald. I didn\u0027t know but you had found it.\" \"Suppose we had?\" said Sam. \"Then you can give it to me, and I\u0027ll take it up to Mr. Chester.\" \"Thank you, but if I\u0027ve found it I\u0027ll carry it up myself.\" \"Have you got it?\" \"You can ask Mr. Chester about it to-morrow morning. Where does he live?\" \"I\u0027ve a great mind not to tell you,\" said the law student, resentfully. \"Then I\u0027ll find out in the \u0027Directory\u0027 and let Mr. Chester know you wouldn\u0027t tell us.\" Upon this Sam got the desired information. He was told that Mr. Chester lived in West Thirty-fifth Street. \"Let us go,\" said Henry. Sam followed him out. \"Shall we go up there to-night?\" he asked. \"Yes; it is no doubt very valuable, and the sooner we get it into the hands of the owner, the better.\" They took the University Place cars, and in a little more than half an hour reached Thirty-fifth Street. They heard the neighboring clocks strike six as they rang the bell. The door was opened by a colored man. \"Does Mr. Chester live here?\" asked Sam. \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"Can I see him?\" \"He\u0027s just gone in to dinner.\" \"I only want to see him a minute.\" \"Mr. Chester don\u0027t like to be disturbed when he\u0027s at dinner. You can come round again in an hour.\" Sam looked at Henry for advice. \"Tell Mr. Chester,\" said Henry, \"that we have found something belonging to him, and wish to return it to him.\" \"You haven\u0027t found his ring?\" said the servant, excited. \"Yes, we have; but we will only deliver it into his hands.\" \"Come right in. Just stand here in the hall, and I\u0027ll tell him.\" Presently a pleasant-looking man of middle age came from the dining-room, and looked inquiringly from one to the other. \"Which is the boy that has my ring?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m the one,\" said Sam, promptly. \"Show it to me, if you please.\" \"You promised a reward of twenty-five dollars,\" said Sam, with anxiety. \"Certainly. If the ring is mine, you shall have the reward.\" Thereupon Sam produced the ring. Mr. Chester received it with great satisfaction. \"Yes, it is the one,\" he said. \"Where did you find it?\" Sam described the place as well as he could. \"So you saw my advertisement?\" \"Yes, sir; a friend of mine read it to me this morning.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you bring it to my office before?\" Sam hesitated, but Henry said, in a low voice: \"Tell the truth, Sam.\" \"The fact is,\" said he, \"I pawned it, and it was some trouble for me to get it again.\" \"You pawned it! How much did you get on it?\" \"Five dollars.\" \"Five dollars! Why, the ring cost six hundred dollars!\" Henry and Sam looked at each other in blank astonishment. How could that little ring be worth so much? \"I am glad we didn\u0027t know how much it was worth,\" said Henry. \"It would have made us feel nervous.\" \"I am surprised that the pawnbroker gave it back to you at all,\" said Mr. Chester. \"He must have known something of its value.\" \"He didn\u0027t want to give it up. He said it was stolen, and he would call the police.\" \"What did you say, then?\" \"Henry asked him if he thought it was stolen when I brought it to him, and he said yes. Then Henry threatened to have him taken up for receiving stolen goods.\" \"Good!\" said Mr. Chester, laughing. \"Your friend would make a good lawyer. At any rate, I am glad I have got it back. Have you had dinner, boys?\" \"No, sir,\" answered Henry. \"Then come in and dine with me. My family are all away except my wife, and there is plenty of room.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Henry Martin. \"We will accept your invitation.\" \"You can hang your hats up, and follow me.\" Sam began to feel bashful, but he obeyed directions, and followed Mr. Chester into a handsome dining-room in the rear extension, where a lady was already sitting at one end of the table. \"I bring you two guests, Mrs. Chester,\" said her husband. \"These two young gentlemen have brought me my diamond ring.\" \"You are, indeed, fortunate in recovering it,\" said his wife. \"Young gentlemen, you can sit, one on this side, the other opposite. I think, John, you will have to introduce them by name.\" \"Really, that is more than I can do,\" said the lawyer, laughing. \"My name is Henry Martin,\" said Henry, who was perfectly self-possessed. \"Mine is Sam Barker,\" said the young outlaw. \"Shall I send you some soup, Mr. Martin?\" \"Yes, thank you.\" \"And you, Mr. Barker?\" Sam stared and wanted to laugh. It seemed so droll to be called \"Mr. Barker,\" but he managed to answer properly. Mr. Chester was a man of some humor, and he enjoyed Sam\u0027s evident embarrassment. He took pains to be ceremoniously polite. Sam, who was used to the free and easy ways of a restaurant, hardly knew how to act. Henry Martin, though now thrown upon his own exertions, had been well brought up, and betrayed no awkwardness. At the close of the meal, to which Sam, despite his bashfulness, did full justice, Mr. Chester opened his pocket-book and produced twenty-five dollars in bills. \"Is this to be divided between you?\" he inquired. \"No, sir,\" said Henry; \"Sam found the ring. It is all for him.\" \"Allow me to offer you five dollars, also,\" said the lawyer, who was pleased with Henry\u0027s manner. \"Thank you, sir, I would rather not take it.\" \"At all events, if I can ever be of any service to you, let me know.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" Soon afterward the boys left the house. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82837.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
