{"id":15557,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. — HOW IT WAS ARRANGED.","content":"\"Sam,\" said the young student, the next morning, \"I have spoken to my father about your remaining here as a companion to Arthur.\" \"What did he say?\" asked Sam, anxiously. \"That you may stay a month on trial. If the arrangement proves satisfactory, you can remain longer.\" \"I\u0027m ever so much obliged to you,\" said Sam, overjoyed. \"I hope I\u0027ll suit.\" \"I hope you will, too, for Arthur\u0027s sake. You must bear in mind that we expect you to lay aside all your bad habits, and try to become refined and gentlemanly.\" \"I\u0027ll try,\" said Sam, earnestly. \"You will take lessons of Arthur\u0027s tutor, and study with him. Though considerably younger than you are he is much more advanced in his studies, and will be able to help you in any difficulties.\" \"Perhaps he won\u0027t want to be bothered with me.\" \"On the contrary, it will interest and amuse him to be so occupied. There is no reason why you should not improve fast.\" \"I want to know something,\" said Sam. \"Ever since I met that girl on the boat I\u0027ve been ashamed of being such a know-nothing.\" \"I am glad to hear you say that. It is encouraging to find that you are sensible of your deficiencies. It is the first step toward remedying them.\" \"Will the tutor lick me if I don\u0027t know my lessons?\" asked Sam, anxiously. The student smiled. \"He wouldn\u0027t do that,\" he answered, \"but he will inform my father—that is, if you persist in neglecting your lessons—and that might lead to your being dismissed.\" \"I\u0027ll study,\" said Sam. \"You see if I don\u0027t, even if it makes my head ache awful.\" \"You look as if you could stand a mode amount of study,\" said the sophomore, smiling good-naturedly. \"If your head aches very bad we can give you some pills.\" \"I guess it won\u0027t,\" said Sam, hastily, for he had a distinct remembrance of having been dosed with some very nauseous pills in his early days. \"My father will see that you are provided with suitable clothes,\" proceeded Brown; \"and you shall have a little spending money also; but you must not spend any of it for cigars.\" \"I won\u0027t,\" said Sam, virtuously. \"It seems almost like a dream,\" he added, \"to think of my having a private tutor, with nice clothes and spending money. I wonder what Henry Martin would say.\" \"Who is Henry Martin?\" \"I used to room with him in New York. He is a nice boy, Henry is, a good deal better\u0027n me. He used to save his money and put it in the bank, and study evenings.\" \"And you didn\u0027t, I suppose?\" \"No. I was a fool; but I won\u0027t be any longer. I\u0027m going to turn over a new leaf.\" \"If you do, I shall not regret having engaged you as a companion for Arthur.\" Here Arthur\u0027s voice was heard, as he entered the room. \"What are you two talking about?\" he inquired. \"I was telling Sam you would miss him when he went away.\" \"So I shall. Why can\u0027t he stay a little longer?\" Arthur had not yet been told of the plan for giving him a companion. \"You would get tired of me,\" said Sam. \"No, I wouldn\u0027t.\" \"Not if I stayed a month?\" \"Will you, really?\" asked Arthur, his pale face brightening up with evident pleasure. \"He shall stay if you would like to have him,\" said his brother, \"and study with you every day. I think Prof. Taylor will be willing to take one additional pupil.\" \"Will he live here in this house?\" asked Arthur, with animation. \"Certainly,\" \"Then I shan\u0027t feel lonely any more,\" said Arthur. \"I\u0027ve been wanting company.\" \"I am sorry to say Sam\u0027s studies have been neglected, and he may require some assistance in getting his lessons.\" \"I\u0027ll help him,\" said Arthur, eagerly. So it was arranged, and so it was that Sam; after drifting about for years, found at last a good home. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82858.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
