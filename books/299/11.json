I didn\u0027t find the ring. I had no claim to it.\" \"No matter, if he was willing to give it to you. He can afford it.\" \"I have no doubt of it; but I didn\u0027t want to take it.\" \"You ain\u0027t much like me, Henry. You wouldn\u0027t catch me refusing.\" \"I presume not,\" said Henry, smiling. \"I say, wasn\u0027t that a tiptop dinner?\" said Sam, smacking his lips as he thought of it. \"It beats the restaurant all hollow. We\u0027d have had to pay a dollar apiece for such a lot of things, and then they wouldn\u0027t have been so good.\" \"That\u0027s so, Sam. We can\u0027t expect to live like that every day.\" \"There\u0027s one thing seems funny, Henry—them bowls of water they bring on at the end to wash your hands in. I was just goin\u0027 to drink mine when I saw Mr. Chester wash his fingers in his. It don\u0027t seem nice to have wash bowls on the dinner-table.\" \"We never have been much into fashionable society, Sam. I\u0027ve no doubt there are a good many things that would seem strange to us if we did.\" \"When I am rich, I\u0027ll live just like Mr. Chester,\" said Sam, enthusiastically. \"We have never been much into fashionable society, Sam. I\u0027ve no doubt there are a good many things that would seem strange to us if we did.\" \"When I am rich, I\u0027ll live just like Mr. Chester,\" said Sam, enthusiastically. \"If you ever want to be rich, you must save up money.\" \"I can\u0027t now.\" \"Why can\u0027t you save up part of these twenty-five dollars?\" \"I owe part of it to you.\" \"Only about five dollars.\" \"I\u0027ve got to get along till the end of the week.\" \"You ought to be able to save fifteen dollars, at any rate. I\u0027ll go with you to the savings-bank, and you can put it in to-night, I know a bank that keeps open till eight o\u0027clock.\" Sam hesitated, and looked reluctant. \"I guess I\u0027ll wait and see how much I need to carry me through the week,\" he said. \"At any rate, pay me what you owe me, and I\u0027ll deposit a part of it on my own account.\" Settlement was made, and Henry, accompanied by Sam, went round to the Sixpenny Savings-Bank, then established on Astor Place, in a part of the Mercantile Library Building. It is kept open every day in the week from 10 A. M. till 8 P. M., thus affording better accommodation to depositors than most institutions of the kind. Sam had never been in a savings-bank before, and he looked about him with curiosity. Henry took the five-dollar bill which Sam had paid him, and handed it with his bankbook to the receiving clerk, saying: \"I want to deposit three dollars of this.\" An entry was made in the book, which was returned to him, with two dollars change. Henry turned away. \"Is that all?\" asked Sam. \"Yes, that is all.\" \"Supposin\u0027 you wanted to draw out money, what would you do, then?\" \"Go to that other clerk, and tell him how much you wanted to draw. He would give you a paper to sign, and then he\u0027d give you the money.\" \"How much money have you got here now, Henry?\" \"Thirty-five dollars,\" answered his companion, with pardonable pride. \"That\u0027s about twice as much as I have got here.\" \"Yes; don\u0027t you think you had better take out a book?\" \"I guess I will come next week,\" said Sam, hesitating. \"You have no idea how independent it makes me feel,\" said Henry. \"Now, if I am sick I know I shan\u0027t have to suffer, for a time at least. I could live for seven or eight weeks on what I\u0027ve got here in the bank.\" \"That\u0027s so. I wish I had thirty-five dollars.\" \"You may have it after a while if you\u0027ll do as I do—be economical and saving.\" \"I\u0027ll think about it,\" said Sam. \"I\u0027d like to have something to fall back upon in my old age.\" Henry commended this plan, though he knew Sam too well to have much hope of his carrying it out. As it turned out, not a dollar of the reward which he had been paid found its way to the savings-bank. How it was disposed of we shall see. The next day, as Sam was going to the office, he met a young man with whom he had lately become acquainted. \"How are you, Sam?\" he asked. \"Tiptop,\" answered Sam. \"How does the world use you?\" \"Pretty well. I\u0027ve just made some money.\" \"How much?\" \"Twenty-five dollars.\" \"That isn\u0027t bad. How did you do it?\" \"I found a diamond ring in Wall Street, and got the money for a reward.\" \"Have you got it now?\" \"Most of it.\" \"What are you going to do with it?\" \"Henry Martin advises me to put it in the savings-bank.\" \"Who is Henry Martin?\" \"He is a boy that rooms with me.\" \"Take my advice, and don\u0027t do it.\" \"Why not? Would the bank break?\" \"I don\u0027t know as it would; but what good would it do?\" \"They give you interest, don\u0027t they?\" \"Yes, but it\u0027s only six per cent. The interest on twenty-five dollars would only come to a dollar and a half in a year. That\u0027s too slow for me.\" \"What would you advise me to do, then?\" asked Sam. \"Is there any way of making money?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027d do if I were you. I\u0027d buy part of a ticket in the Havana lottery.\" \"Could I make money that way?\" \"Say you bought a fifth of a ticket; that would come to ten dollars. Now the biggest prize is a hundred thousand dollars!\" It almost took away Sam\u0027s breath to think of such a large sum. \"I couldn\u0027t draw that, could I?\" he asked, eagerly. \"You might draw a fifth of it; that would be twenty thousand dollars.\" \"Why, that would make me rich!\" exclaimed Sam, in excitement. \"I\u0027d never have to work no more.\" \"Besides, there are other prizes a great many, only smaller.\" \"I\u0027d be pretty sure to draw something, wouldn\u0027t I?\" \"You\u0027d stand just as good a chance as anybody.\" \"Have you got any tickets in the lottery?\" \"Yes, I bought a fifth of a ticket yesterday.\" \"Where do they sell? \u0027em?\" asked Sam. His companion told him. \"I guess I\u0027ll go round and buy one,\" he said. \"It must be better than putting the money in the savings-bank.\" \"That\u0027s what I think. You may not get a big prize the first time, to be sure, but it\u0027s worth waiting for.\" Sam was not much of a financier, nor did he know how little real chance there was of drawing the large prize he desired. He did not know that it was about the most foolish use he could make of his money. He was deceived by the consideration that somebody would win the prize, and that his chance was as good as anybody. It is always unlucky for a boy or young man when he yields for the first time to the fatal fascination of the lottery. He may fail time after time, but continue to hug the delusion that the next time will bring him luck. There are clerks in New York and other large cities who have not only squandered all their own savings, but abstracted money from their employers, led on by this ruinous passion. During his noon intermission Sam went round to the lottery office, and returned with the coveted ticket. He put it away with great complacency, and gave himself up to dreams of future wealth. If he could only win that twenty thousand dollars, how rich he would be! How he would triumph over Henry, with his poor thirty-five dollars in the savings-bank! \"Poor Henry! I\u0027ll do something for him, if I only win the prize,\" he thought. \"Maybe I\u0027ll buy out some big business, and make him my clerk, with a good salary. Won\u0027t it be jolly?\" No doubt it would, but Sam was counting chickens that were not very likely to be hatched. There was another bad consequence of his purchase. It made him lavish of the money he had left. It amounted to nine dollars and some odd cents. Had he followed Henry\u0027s advice, a part of this would have been deposited in the bank; but Sam\u0027s dreams of wealth led him to look upon it as a mere trifle, hardly worth taking into account. So day by day it melted away till there was none left.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82838.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
