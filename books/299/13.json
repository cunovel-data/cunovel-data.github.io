{"id":15539,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII. — HOW SAM SUCCEEDED.","content":"Sam did not tell Henry of his purchase of a lottery ticket, being well aware that his roommate would not approve such an investment. \"I\u0027ll wait till the lottery is drawn, and then if I get a prize I\u0027ll tell him about it. He can\u0027t say anything, then.\" Such were Sam\u0027s thoughts. He knew, of course, that he might draw a blank; but he did not take much account of that. He lived in a dream of wealth till the day when the result was to be made known. On a certain day the lucky numbers were to be published in the Herald, and for this issue Sam was anxiously waiting. The number of his ticket was 7,567. \"Seven is a lucky number,\" said the acquaintance who induced him to buy. \"Your number begins and ends with a seven. It\u0027s likely to draw something.\" Sam listened to this prediction with complacency. He did not reflect upon the absurdity of one number being luckier than another, and congratulated himself that he had been so fortunate as to get a number containing two sevens. Sam was not usually an early riser. As a general thing he lay in bed as late as he dared to; but on the particular morning which was to terminate his suspense he jumped out of bed at half-past five o\u0027clock. \"What are you going to do, Sam?\" inquired Henry, opening his eyes. \"I\u0027m going to get up,\" answered Sam. \"What\u0027s up? Do you have to go to work earlier than usual?\" \"No, that isn\u0027t it,\" answered Sam, evasively. \"I\u0027m tired of lying abed.\" \"Rather strange!\" thought Henry. \"Can it be possible that Sam is turning over a new leaf?\" He did not give much credence to this, but concluded that Sam had a particular reason, which he would learn in due time. Sam dressed hastily, and walked round to the Herald office, and purchased a copy of the paper, which he unfolded eagerly. He did not immediately find the list of lucky numbers, but at length his eye rested on them. He looked eagerly through the long list, hoping to see number 7,567 in it, but in vain. A prize of fifty dollars was drawn by 7,562; but that was the nearest approach to good fortune. Poor Sam! His heart sank within him. He had been dreaming golden dreams of fortune for a week past, but now he was brought down to the cold and barren reality. All his money was gone except a dollar, on which he must live for two days and a half, till his weekly wages were due. \"It\u0027s a shame!\" muttered Sam, in bitter disappointment. \"I was sure my ticket would win something. Wasn\u0027t there two sevens in it? I believe they cheated.\" It was too early yet for breakfast, and he sauntered about idle and purposeless. Suddenly he came upon the young man upon whose advice he had purchased his ticket. He, too, had a Herald in his hand, but was not looking particularly elated. \"He hasn\u0027t got anything, either,\" thought Sam, shrewdly. Just then he caught sight of Sam. \"Did you draw a prize?\" he asked. \"No, I did not,\" said Sam, gloomily. \"I wish I hadn\u0027t bought a ticket. That ten dollars is just throwed away. I wish I had it back.\" \"Better luck next time.\" \"What good\u0027ll that do me?\" inquired Sam. \"I\u0027m dead broke. I haven\u0027t got money enough to buy another ticket. Didn\u0027t you tell me I was sure to win with two sevens in my number?\" \"I didn\u0027t say you were sure. I only said it was a lucky number.\" \"Well, I wish I had my money back, that\u0027s all. I\u0027ve only got a dollar to last me till Saturday night.\" \"I ain\u0027t much better off myself, Sam; but it\u0027s no use giving up. Of course a feller can\u0027t be sure to win a big prize the first time. It\u0027s worth trying five or six times.\" \"Where\u0027s the money coming from? Ten dollars don\u0027t grow on every bush.\" \"Can\u0027t you borrow?\" \"My credit ain\u0027t good.\" \"Then, save up till you have enough money.\" \"How am I to save when I only get five dollars a week?\" \"Well, I am sorry for you, Sam; but I\u0027m just as bad off as you are.\" \"Are you going to buy another ticket?\" \"As soon as I can.\" The two parted, and Sam began to reflect. \"Perhaps he is right. I couldn\u0027t expect to draw a prize the very first time. I wish I could get money enough to buy another ticket. Henry could lend me it as well as not; but I know he wouldn\u0027t. He\u0027d just give me a lecture for buying a ticket at all. I wonder if there is any way.\" There seemed to be none except to try Henry, and, small as the chance was, he decided to do it. Henry was just thinking of getting up when Sam returned. \"Back so soon, Sam?\" he said. \"Have you had breakfast?\" \"Not yet.\" \"I see you have the Herald there. What\u0027s the news?\" \"I haven\u0027t looked to see.\" \"You don\u0027t generally buy a morning paper.\" \"No; but there was something I wanted to look at this morning.\" \"You haven\u0027t found another ring, and bought the Herald to see whether it\u0027s advertised?\" \"No; I wish I could find something.\" \"Have you thought about putting part of your money in the savings-bank, Sam?\" \"How can I, when it\u0027s all gone?\" \"Twenty dollars gone in little more than a week!\" exclaimed Henry, in genuine amazement. \"Yes,\" answered Sam, rather confused. \"What on earth did you do with it all?\" \"I guess I must have spent about ten dollars going to the theater, and so on.\" \"What has become of the other ten dollars then?\" \"I bought a lottery ticket,\" said Sam, little uncomfortably. \"Well, you were foolish!\" said Henry. \"What made you do it?\" \"A friend of mine advised me to. He had one himself.\" \"He couldn\u0027t have been much of a friend of yours. I suppose you didn\u0027t draw anything?\" \"No.\" \"I didn\u0027t expect you would.\" \"Other people did, though,\" said Sam, inclined to uphold the lottery system. \"Do you see that long list of prizes?\" \"I never knew anybody that drew a prize,\" said Henry, quietly, \"though I\u0027ve known a good many who bought tickets.\" \"Forbes tells me if I buy another ticket I\u0027m pretty sure to get something.\" \"Then, you\u0027d better not mind what Forbes says.\" \"Of course somebody must draw prizes,\" said Sam, obstinately. \"It\u0027s a poor way to get money, even if you could win one.\" \"I\u0027d risk that. I\u0027d like to buy another ticket.\" Henry shrugged his shoulders. \"I don\u0027t think you are very wise, Sam. It is well you haven\u0027t any more money to throw away.\" This was not promising, but Sam did not mean to give it up. \"Henry,\" he said, \"I wish you\u0027d lend me ten dollars.\" \"What for?\" \"I want to buy one more ticket.\" \"I can\u0027t lend it.\" \"I should think you might. If I don\u0027t get anything this time I\u0027ll never buy again.\" \"I can\u0027t oblige you, Sam.\" \"You mean you won\u0027t,\" said Sam, sulkily. \"No; it happens to be true that I can\u0027t.\" \"Haven\u0027t you thirty-five dollars in the savings-bank?\" \"I had.\" \"You haven\u0027t spent the money?\" \"I have invested it.\" \"How?\" \"I\u0027ve given the book to my employer as security to pay interest on a loan.\" Then, seeing that Sam\u0027s curiosity was aroused, he proceeded to explain that he had borrowed five hundred dollars of his employer to pay for a share in a mercantile venture. \"Do you think you\u0027ll make any money out of it?\" asked Sam, eagerly. \"I hope to.\" \"About how much?\" \"Perhaps I may make a hundred dollars.\" \"I wish I had that much.\" \"I suppose you would buy ten lottery tickets,\" suggested Henry, smiling. Sam admitted he should invest a part that way. \"I prefer to invest my money in legitimate business,\" said Henry. \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" said Sam. \"I might have drawn the twenty-thousand-dollar prize. That\u0027s better than a hundred dollars.\" \"So it is; but if I keep on I have a good deal better chance of getting up to twenty thousand dollars than you.\" \"I wish my boss would lend me five hundred dollars,\" said Sam. \"I wouldn\u0027t advise him to,\" said Henry, smiling. \"Now let us go to breakfast.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3002/82840.html","bookId":299,"book":{"id":299,"title":"Sam\u0027s Chance And How He Improved It","description":"简介： He was a boy of fifteen, who, for three years, had been drifting about the streets of New York, getting his living as he could; now blacking boots, now selling papers, now carrying bundleseverything by turns, and nothing long.
