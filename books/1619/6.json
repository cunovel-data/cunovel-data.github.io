{"id":94505,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Mata Hari The prisoner had welcomed Beauregard\u0027s request that he be allowed to see her. Even were he not continuing the Malinbois investigation, he would have been inclined to pay a call. He had given evidence at her trial but they had never been introduced. To step out of the staff car on to the parade ground was to set foot in a cemetery. The condemned woman was held in a barracks near Paris, long out of regular use, tenants gone to feed the war. The uncurtained windows of the long halls were dusty. Only one dormitory was inhabited. Eight men, pulled from the front to serve as a firing squad, slept in peace and comfort. To them, this must be a relief. The night was black as ink. Like a warm convict, the prisoner was to be shot at dawn. Sunset would be a more appropriate execution hour for a vampire. A lone light burned in an office. Beauregard rapped on a door. Lantier, a veteran with half a face, opened up and invited him in. Without a hint of insubordination, the turnkey made it clear he resented having his night disturbed by visitors pandering to the whims of an enemy of France. Lantier looked over Beauregard\u0027s authorisation papers, clucking at each distinguished signature. At length, he decided in Beauregard\u0027s favour and ordered that the Englishman be allowed into the cell. A lecture was delivered in rapid French about the degree of intercourse allowed with the woman. There was to be no physical contact, no object was to be passed from one to the other. The vampire\u0027s reputation was bound to outlive her. This fuss fed the greatly exaggerated stories they were telling. It was in the interests of the lady\u0027s \u0027victims\u0027 that she be considered irresistible, lest it be decided they had a degree of culpability in her feats of espionage. Surely, no ordinary woman could extract secrets from so many of the great and good. This was an extreme case of the brand of fascination vampires were popularly supposed to be able to exert over their helpless prey. Of the officers whose names had come up in testimony at her closed trial, most who still lived remained on active service. Only a few insignificant lieutenants had been swept down with her. Even now, the odious General Mireau planned his next offensive. It had been seriously suggested that the soldiers assigned to this detail be maimed veterans unmanned by the war. Following Lantier\u0027s slow progress to the cells, he wondered if the crackpot notion had been implemented. If so, it displayed an alarming ignorance of the physical act of vampirism. Lantier opened a stout door and stood aside, allowing him into the cell. It was an unpainted room with barely the atmosphere of a cupboard. The prisoner sat by a small window, looking at the last of the moon. With her hair roughly cropped and in a shapeless cotton dress, she did not resemble the jewelled seductress who had carried all Paris with her. She turned to look at him and was indeed beautiful. She claimed to be half-Javanese, but Beauregard knew she was the daughter of a Dutch hatter and his provincial wife. After turning, her eyes had changed. She had slit pupils like a cat. The effect was enormously striking. \u0027Madame Zelle?\u0027 he enquired, politely but without need. She stood graciously and acknowledged him. \u0027Mr Beauregard.\u0027 He considered her extended, pale hand and shrugged. \u0027Regulations,\u0027 he explained, weakly. The prisoner attempted a smile. \u0027Of course. Touch me and you would be my slave. You would overpower the guards and fight to the death to aid my escape.\u0027 \u0027Something like that.\u0027 \u0027How silly.\u0027 A chair was brought for him by the turnkey. She resumed her own chair and he sat down. \u0027So you are the clever Englishman who caught me?\u0027 \u0027I am afraid so.\u0027 \u0027Why afraid? Did you not do your duty?\u0027 Before the war, he had seen her famous Javanese Dance of Death. She was no Isadora and whoever schooled her was no Diaghilev, but the powerful effect she had on an audience, whether general or private, General or Private, could not be denied. \u0027You are an honourable English patriot and I am an unprincipled Dutch adventuress. Is that not true?\u0027 \u0027It is not for me to say, Madame.\u0027 Her eyes were growing larger. There was cold, undirected anger in them. But also something else. \u0027You are a warm man?\u0027 Had she expected him to be a vampire like her? Some nosferatu believed only their own kind could match them for brain-power. \u0027How old are you, Mr Beauregard?\u0027 That was an unusual question. \u0027I am sixty-four.\u0027 \u0027I would have thought younger. By five or ten years. Some vampire taint has crept into you, retarding the processes of aging. It does not matter. It is not too late for you to turn. You might live forever, grow young again.\u0027 \u0027Is that such a pleasant prospect?\u0027 She smiled genuinely, not for effect. A tiny, shining fang peeped between her red lips. \u0027Not, I confess, at this immediate moment. I am immortal and you are not, but you shall see tomorrow\u0027s sunset.\u0027 He tried to look at his wrist-watch without being too obvious. The dawn was two hours away. \u0027There may yet be a reprieve.\u0027 \u0027Thank you for considering that possibility, Englishman. I am given to understand you personally pleaded for my life. You could only do that at risk to your own reputation.\u0027 Unless she really could suck secrets from a mind with a single glance, she could not possibly know he had recommended lenience. Her fang became more prominent as her smile broadened. \u0027I still have sources of information. Secrets are not hard to come by.\u0027 \u0027As you have proved.\u0027 \u0027And so have you. My poor secrets have been yours as many men\u0027s were mine. Simply by sitting in a room and thinking, you saw through my veils and schemes. I admire that.\u0027 He tried not to feel flattered. It was one of her greatest weapons. Elderly officers had been her favoured prey. \u0027I have had fine tutors in the whole art of detection,\u0027 Beauregard admitted. \u0027You are a senior member of the Ruling Cabal of the Diogenes Club, the second or third most important man in the British Secret Service.\u0027 She knew even more than was determined at her trial. \u0027Do not worry, Charles. I shall take to my poor grave those few of your secrets to which I am a party.\u0027 Suddenly, she was using his Christian name. I am sincerely sorry, Gertrud,\u0027 he replied in kind. \u0027Gertrud?\u0027 she said, rolling the unfamiliar name around her pointed tongue. \u0027Gertrud,\u0027 she confessed, at last. Her slim shoulders slumped with disappointment. \u0027So ugly, so sad, so dumpy. Almost German. But it is the name I was born with, the name I shall die under.\u0027 \u0027But not the name of your immortality,\u0027 he said. She dramatically framed her pretty face with long fingers, fluttering her nails in moonlight. \u0027No, I shall eternally be Mata Hari: She was parodying the American, Theda Bara. If they made a film about Mata Hari (certainly, they would make many) then Theda Bara, a professional vampire whose name was an anagram of \u0027Arab Death\u0027, was the only actress for the role. She was of a bloodline which took to photography. Many vampires showed up on film as a species of blurry smudge. \u0027They will remember me, won\u0027t they?\u0027 she asked, suddenly vulnerable. \u0027My reputation will not melt like snow in the sun, surpassed by some new temptress.\u0027 It was possible this woman had acted all her life; underneath the veils, there was perhaps no reality. Or maybe there was a secret self she would take with her into true death. \u0027There will be no pardon, Charles. No mercy at the last moment. This is true? They will kill me?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m afraid a certain person has insisted,\u0027 he admitted, sadly. \u0027General Mireau,\u0027 she spat. \u0027His blood was thin, you know. Like English soup. I mean no offence. Do you know how many men died through his actions? He was more lethal to his troops on his own than under my influence.\u0027 There had been a mutiny in the general\u0027s command. Mireau was one of the worst of the uniformed fools who thought the war a firepit that could be extinguished by pouring in living men. The general believed this woman\u0027s death would cleanse the blood from his record. \u0027The other side are no better,\u0027 she said. \u0027It was as easy to gull Germans.\u0027 Early in the war, Gertrud Zelle had been in the employ of the French secret service. It had not been proved, but he knew she had worked for the Russians, the Hungarians, the Turks and the Italians. Even the British. \u0027At court, I was presented to the Kaiser. I was turned by the Graf von Dracula.\u0027 In this cold new century, the Graf was careful with his bloodline. More than any other vampire elder, he was responsible for the spread of the condition through Europe. Now he controlled rigidly the selection of those he turned. Even warm, Gertrud Zelle had been a remarkable woman. \u0027I see I do not surprise you.\u0027 She held up her hand. It was pale in the moonlight, blue veins distinct. In an instant, it was a webbed gargoyle\u0027s claw, thorny barbs tipping thumb and fingers. Then it was human again. \u0027Formidable,\u0027 he said. \u0027Only someone close to the bloodline could manage that trick.\u0027 \u0027Maybe not,\u0027 she said, mysterious but teasing. \u0027But in my case, it is so. As I have played the generals of Europe as puppets, so have I been played.\u0027 It occurred to Beauregard that she could transform herself entirely. She could find the strength to tear through the walls. Something kept her here. \u0027At the last, I shall be free of him.\u0027 So that was it. He felt a certain disappointment. \u0027I did not give myself up deliberately, Charles. Your victory stands as an achievement of note. It is just that I\u0027m not necessarily despondent. It is a commonplace that many things are worse than death.\u0027 From experience, Beauregard knew those of the Dracula bloodline often came to believe that. \u0027He is a monster. Dracula.\u0027 Beauregard nodded. \u0027We have met.\u0027 \u0027You British,\u0027 she continued, \u0027you were right to throw him out.\u0027 \u0027It was not so simple.\u0027 \u0027Maybe not. Yet Britain would not long tolerate Dracula and Germany has become his paradise.\u0027 \u0027The Graf has the knack of gaining influence at courts. He\u0027s been at the business for five hundred years.\u0027 Gertrud Zelle leaned forward and reached out. The turnkey rumbled. The pistol in his belt was loaded with silver. The prisoner\u0027s hand halted, inches away from Beauregard\u0027s arm. She fixed his eye. \u0027He will make of this century a killing ground,\u0027 she said, seriously. \u0027In his warm days, he murdered one-third of his own subjects. Imagine what he would do to those he considers his enemies.\u0027 \u0027Germany is nearly broken,\u0027 he said, echoing the official position, wishing he did not know better. \u0027It\u0027s hard to deceive a deceiver, Charles.\u0027 She sat back, straightening. A fringe of pre-dawn light haloed her cropped head. She looked more like Joan of Arc than a vampire spy. \u0027Your war is over,\u0027 he said, trying to be kind. \u0027You know much about us, Charles. Vampires. You must have had a remarkable teacher.\u0027 He adjusted his collar, sure he was flushing. \u0027Who was she?\u0027 \u0027You would not know the lady\u0027s name.\u0027 \u0027She was old? An elder?\u0027 Beauregard nodded. Genevieve Dieudonne was older even than the Graf. A fifteenth-century girl. \u0027She is still alive?\u0027 \u0027The last I heard, she was very well. In America, I believe.\u0027 \u0027Do not be vague, Charles. You know precisely where she is. You would make it your business to keep track of things.\u0027 Gertrud Zelle had caught him out. Genevieve was in California, growing blood oranges. \u0027She was a fool to let you grow old and die, Charles. No, I take that back. That was your decision, not hers. If I had been her, I would have made you want to turn. I would have used my powers.\u0027 \u0027Your \"powers\"? Madame Zelle, it would seem you have been reading too many of your notices.\u0027 \u0027We do have powers, you know. It\u0027s not all conjuring.\u0027 Dawn pinked the sky. Her face was paler than ever. They had been starving her in captivity. She must be in considerable discomfort. Many new-borns would by now have been maddened by red thirst. \u0027I suppose it makes her better than me, that she would not change a man\u0027s mind through underhand means, even if it were for the best.\u0027 \u0027Believe me, Genevieve would not claim to be better than anyone.\u0027 \u0027Genevieve? A pretty name. I hate her already.\u0027 Beauregard remembered pain. And more pleasant things. There was a fan of red in the sky. \u0027We don\u0027t have much time left,\u0027 Gertrud Zelle said, businesslike. \u0027It is regrettable,\u0027 he agreed. \u0027Very well. For the sake of your vampire lady, I shall pass on to you my surviving secret. You have been kind when you need not have been, and this is my gift to you. Use it as you will. Win the war, if it can be won.\u0027 Was this some trick? \u0027No, Charles,\u0027 she said, either reading the surface of his mind or following his obvious thought process, \u0027I am not the Scheherezade of the age. I shall not delay my final appointment.\u0027 He tried to think around this development. \u0027Convince me, Gertrud. Convince me I am not to be your last victim.\u0027 \u0027That is not unfair, Charles. I shall mention a place and a name. If you are interested, I shall continue.\u0027 Beauregard nodded. Gertrud Zelle smiled again, as if laying down face cards. \u0027Chateau du Malinbois,\u0027 she said. \u0027Professor Ten Brincken.\u0027 This was what he had hoped for. Another strand of the spiderweb. I\u0027m convinced,\u0027 he said, trying not to let his eagerness show. \u0027See,\u0027 she said, fang glistening, \u0027a vampire always knows. I\u0027ll make it brief and simple. You can take notes, if you wish. The world has made of me what it would, and I make no excuses for myself. I have followed the dictates of my heart, even when such courses were patently unwise ...\u0027 A small crowd of journalists and interested parties huddled around a brazier on the parade ground. The last snowfall was gone, though patches of gritty ice would have made actual parade hazardous. Beauregard looked at faces. None of Gertrud Zelle\u0027s \u0027admirers\u0027 thought it worth while attending this performance. Was her story another farewell performance? It was possible she hoped in death to spread some misleading lie, distracting him from whatever the Germans were really about at Malinbois. He was inclined to believe her. The Graf von Dracula was a Gothic thinker and her narrative was a Gothic tale, with castles and crypts and blood and doomed noblemen. He had filled the remainder of his notebook with shorthand. The soldiers of the firing squad stood as if for inspection. Boys with ancient eyes. After four years, not only the undead looked older than their faces. Beauregard wondered if these poilus would be happier if the prisoner at the stake were Mireau. In the ranks, the general was hated more than the Kaiser. \u0027Charles,\u0027 a woman\u0027s voice cut through his musings. \u0027We meet in the most odd places.\u0027 The small vampire was dressed in jodhpurs and a Norfolk jacket, reddish hair done up under an oversized tweed cap, eyes shielded by thick blue-tinted glasses. Her clear voice retained a little Irish. \u0027Kate,\u0027 he said, surprised and pleased. \u0027Good morning.\u0027 She slipped off her glasses and squinted at the fading blush in the dingy grey sky. \u0027It\u0027s morning, at least.\u0027 Kate Reed was ten years his junior, turned at twenty-five. In thirty years of the vampire life, her eyes hadn\u0027t aged. The journalist had been something of a heroine in the Terror, editing an underground periodical, two hops ahead of the Carpathian Guard. She was no less critical of authority in the age of Good King Victor. A Fabian Socialist and advocate of Home Rule, she wrote for the New Statesman and the Cambridge Magazine. Since hostilities had commenced, she had been twice expelled from France and once imprisoned in Ireland. \u0027I thought you were recalled to London,\u0027 he observed. She gave a smart, sharp little smile, eyes twinkling. \u0027I retired from Grub Street, then volunteered as an ambulance driver. Our old friend Mina Harker is on the committee, still trying to make things right. I was shipped back on the next boat.\u0027 \u0027So you\u0027re not a reporter?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m an observer, always. It is a thing we vampires are good at. It comes from a long life and too much spare time.\u0027 Dawnlight speared across the ground and she put her glasses back on. He shared a history with Kate Reed. They were both creatures of another century. She was fitter by far to survive this new era. \u0027I have always admired you,\u0027 he said. \u0027You talk as if it were yourself they wanted to shoot.\u0027 \u0027Maybe they should. I\u0027m tired, Kate.\u0027 She took his hand and squeezed. He tried not to let her see she was hurting him. Like many vampires of comparatively recent vintage, she did not know her own strength. \u0027Charles, you are perhaps the last decent man in Europe. Do not be disheartened, no matter what. The \"War to End War\" talk may be rot, but we can make a truth of it. This is our world as much as it is Ruthven\u0027s or Dracula\u0027s.\u0027 \u0027And hers?\u0027 He pointed with his head. As the sun cleared the barracks, Gertrud Zelle was led out by the turnkey and two guards. At her own request she was veiled to protect her sensitive face from the light. She refused the blindfold and insisted no priest be present. \u0027Madame Mata Hari has been silly,\u0027 Kate snapped. \u0027I\u0027ve little enough sympathy for her. Good men died wholesale because of her wiles.\u0027 \u0027You are a Fabian patriot.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s nothing wrong with Britain that impaling the Prime Minister wouldn\u0027t cure.\u0027 \u0027Now you sound like Vlad Tepes.\u0027 \u0027Another gentleman who would be much improved by the addition of a length of stout hawthorne.\u0027 \u0027I read your piece on the trial, Kate.\u0027 She fluttered a little, trying to swallow vanity. \u0027And ...?\u0027 \u0027You said what had to be said.\u0027 \u0027But the warm-blooded, cold-souled General Mireau still struts like a scarfaced peacock and rattles his medals at vampire fillies, kneeling at Mass with a conscience as clear as Vichy water.\u0027 \u0027You should know by now that commanders-in-chief make it a point of honour not to follow the advice of mere journalists. I am sure General Petain read your articles with interest.\u0027 \u0027I have more to write. Mireau must be brought to book.\u0027 \u0027And Sir Douglas Haig?\u0027 \u0027Him too, and the bloody lot of them.\u0027 Gertrud Zelle stood against a pole as a guard tied her hands. She held her veiled head high, unafraid. \u0027Queen of the May,\u0027 Kate commented. The sergeant of the execution party read out the verdict of the court. His thin voice was lost in the bitter wind. At least ten counts merited death. With the sentence read, the sergeant rolled up the paper and stuck it in his belt. He drew and raised his sword; eight soldiers lifted rifles and took aim. Seven silver bullets and one plain lead. Any man could have the dud and tell himself he had not fired a killing shot. The sword wavered and fell. Shots clustered in the prisoner\u0027s torso. A stray pocked the ground a dozen yards behind the pole. Gertrud Zelle\u0027s head hung and the veil slipped from her like a scarf, wisping away on the wind. Early-morning sun fell on her face, browning it quickly. Smoke seeped from her mouth and eyes. \u0027That\u0027s that, then,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027Beastly business.\u0027 Beauregard knew it was not finished. The sergeant walked across the parade ground and stood by the truly dead woman, sword like a scythe. \u0027Good Lord,\u0027 Kate said. With a stroke, the sergeant sank his sword into Gertrud Zelle\u0027s neck. The blade bit bone. He had to press gauntleted hands against hilt and point, forcing the silver-steel edge clear through into the post. The head fell to the ground and the sergeant picked it up by the hair, holding it for all to see. The face burned black, cat eyes shrunk like peas.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-6.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
