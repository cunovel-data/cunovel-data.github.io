{"id":94515,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Twice Bitten\n The rule of \"once bitten, twice shy\" seems to have no currency with you,\u0027 said Major Cundall.\n \u0027Under the circumstances, you might say \"once bitten\" means we\u0027re on to something.\u0027\n Cundall sighed but his blood was up. Winthrop saw past the mask now. Behind the cynicism, the flight commander was a tiger. He had not won his DSO and Bar with wittily cutting remarks.\n \u0027So Diogenes insists we have another bash at Malinbois?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s the general thought,\u0027 Winthrop explained.\n Through an enchantment, Albright\u0027s cracked plates had been developed. Jagged white lines streaked across the photographs and areas were blank, but the castle could be seen. Winthrop laid out the photographs on the farmhouse table. The vampire pilots gathered round.\n \u0027This is the tower we\u0027re interested in,\u0027 he said.\n Cundall considered the indicated area. \u0027Looks like a diving board. Do the air pirates of JG1 make prisoners walk the plank?\u0027\n The top of the tower was sheared off. A board affair jutted out of it. The area of interest corresponded with the most damage to the plate.\n \u0027What\u0027s that shadow?\u0027 Bigglesworth asked, \u0027mostly under the blotch? Is that an observer? A gun position?\u0027\n Diogenes had also thought it a puzzle. Winthrop tapped the scale marks at the edge of the photograph.\n \u0027If it\u0027s an observer, he must be a giant,\u0027 he said. \u0027Fifteen feet tall.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a gargoyle, old thing,\u0027 put in Courtney. \u0027Devilish fond of gargoyles, the Hun.\u0027\n \u0027Malinbois was French until JG1 moved in.\u0027\n \u0027Plus de gargoyles en France, too,\u0027 said Courtney. \u0027You should have clocked the mademoiselle from Armentieres I sported on my last leave.\u0027\n Some pilots laughed bitterly. Winthrop suffered less ragging on this visit. Nobody mentioned Spenser or Albright. He noticed the odd new face and tried not to think which old ones were absent. There was an army show on, readying for the enemy push everyone expected before spring. Cundall\u0027s Condors had spent the last few days knocking spotters out of the sky.\n \u0027Looks like we\u0027re in for a twilight patrol,\u0027 Lacey said, almost keen. \u0027If we flit over en masse, we\u0027ll ruffle the red fighting eagle\u0027s feathers.\u0027\n \u0027Baron von Richthofen,\u0027 Roy Brown said, miserably. \u0027Someone has to kill him some time.\u0027\n \u0027Someone has to kill everyone some time,\u0027 said Cundall, thinking it over. At bottom, he was a cautious sort. It was probably why he had survived this long.\n \u0027Diogenes suggests a full patrol this time,\u0027 Winthrop said, knowing the flight commander was entitled to be annoyed with the change of policy.\n \u0027Fair enough,\u0027 Cundall said, mildly. \u0027Courtney, pick an observer and take the Harry Tate.\u0027\n The pilot - a Tasmanian, Winthrop had learned - groaned. The RE8 was not a popular kite. They were called \u0027flapping ducks\u0027, close relatives of the sitting variety.\n \u0027I\u0027ll fly the tip of the formation. Don\u0027t fret so, Courtney. I\u0027ll baby you through.\u0027\n Courtney theatrically clutched his heart. For his part, Winthrop was pleased the flight commander was choosing the men for this patrol rather than delegating the task.\n \u0027Since we had such little fortune with the As last time,\u0027 Cundall said, cruelly, \u0027we\u0027ll put the Bs in the air this show. Bigglesworth, Ball, Brown, you\u0027re up. And, to add a little alphabetical variety, let us, by all means, have a Williamson to balance things out.\u0027\n The pilots began climbing into their Sidcots and hauling on fleece-lined boots. Albert Ball, bent the wrong way in several places, wriggled into flying kit by unorthodox but efficient means. Roy Brown, the sour little Canadian, drank from a pitcher of milk and cow\u0027s blood.\n \u0027Tummy trouble,\u0027 Ginger explained. \u0027Brown\u0027s soothing his ulcer.\u0027\n Brown looked pained but kept drinking. Winthrop understood how a man in this line of work could nurture an ulcer.\n \u0027I say,\u0027 Courtney said, \u0027my usual dance partner in the Harry Tate is Curtiss Stryker and he\u0027s off sick. Ate someone who disagreed with him, I fear.\u0027\n Allard looked grim, expecting to be volunteered. Instead, Cundall turned to Winthrop, smiling evilly.\n \u0027Winthrop, my precious prince, have you ever fired a Lewis gun in anger?\u0027\n \u0027I know which end to hold.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027ll do you.\u0027 He thumbed towards the ceiling. \u0027Ever been up?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve been given a lift across the Channel a couple of times. I\u0027ve even held the stick and not plunged to earth.\u0027\n \u0027A veteran,\u0027 Courtney snorted.\n \u0027Topping,\u0027 Cundall said, \u0027you won\u0027t puke or anything. Care to come along on this jaunt? After all, it is Diogenes\u0027 show. Not mandatory, or anything. Just thought you might like the trip. The scenery is terribly picturesque at sunset.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d love to come,\u0027 Winthrop said, evenly. He was not entitled to be afraid.\n \u0027Good man,\u0027 said Cundall. \u0027Ginger, find our friend some kit, would you? He\u0027s a warm one, so we\u0027d best keep him that way.\u0027\n Whatever the patrol was like, it could not be as bad as hanging around waiting for it to come back. If it came back. He had the impulse to jot a few lines. He pulled out his pocketbook and a stub of pencil.\n Last will and testament?\u0027 Courtney asked.\n No, just notes. Gathering intelligence is a matter of making notes.\"\n \u0027Whatever you say, old son. I always cheer myself up thinking of people I owe money to. If I go west, plenty will be mightily browned off.\u0027\n Winthrop thought hard, and wrote \u0027Dear Cat, if you get this, I\u0027ve run into serious bother. Don\u0027t let it knock you too much. Love you desperately. Edwin.\u0027\n It was feeble but it would have to do. He begged an envelope from Algy Lissie and gummed the letter in. It was a duty done.\n Ginger returned with full flying kit. Winthrop did not ask who had last worn it. Like a discreet valet, the vampire helped him dress. First, he was required to empty his pockets of documents which might interest the Boche if he were captured. A couple of enigmatic despatches from the Diogenes Club went into a shoebox. He chose to keep his matches, cigarette case and a picture of Catriona.\n \u0027Pretty girl,\u0027 Ginger commented. \u0027Swanny neck.\u0027\n Winthrop shivered a little and signed a form pasted to the top of the box. \u0027I swear on my honour that I do not have on my person or on my machine any letters or papers of use to the enemy.\u0027\n Over his khaki shirt and trousers, Winthrop put on two ragged wool pullovers and a pair of Arctic pyjama bottoms. Then he clambered into his Sidcot, a loose gaberdine one-piece lined with lamb\u0027s wool. Paying careful attention, Ginger practically mummified Winthrop\u0027s head: applying first a silk scarf to the neck, then a liberal smearing of cold whale oil to the cheeks and forehead, a thick balaclava helmet, a non-absorbent Nuchwang dogskin face mask and, finally, triplex goggles tinted for night-flying. The outfit was completed by thigh-high boots and muskrat gauntlets. With everything buckled together, Winthrop was completely swaddled, a rotund snowman, his arms stuck out and he waddled rather than walked.\n \u0027It\u0027s getting hottish in here,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027It\u0027ll get cold sharpish up there,\u0027 Ginger said. \u0027Now put your cross on this.\u0027\n Ginger presented an FS20 for signature. Winthrop glanced at the form as he scribbled his name. After a list of the gear issued to him, it stated These are property of the public. Losses due to the exigencies of campaign must be certified by the officer commanding.\u0027\n \u0027Grand,\u0027 Ginger said. \u0027Now, if you go down in flames, the RFC will dun your widow and orphans for the cost of your underwear.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not married,\u0027 Winthrop said, thinking of Catriona.\n \u0027That\u0027s probably for the best.\u0027\n \u0027Good old bloody old Harry Tate,\u0027 Courtney said, patting the side of the RE8. The two-seater spotter was supposed to be sheepish in the air, which was why Cundall was putting up five Sop with Snipe fighters as guard dogs.\n Winthrop gave Dravot his letter and told him to forward it to the addressee if anything untoward happened. The sergeant nodded, understanding, and did not try to tell him he was certain everything would be all right.\n Courtney helped Winthrop climb into the rear cockpit. It was not easy to slip his clothes-expanded bulk past the ring-mounted Lewis. Once he was in the wicker seat, the handles of the machine-gun stuck uncomfortably into his chest.\n The pilot hauled himself up and hung on the machine\u0027s side, peering into Winthrop\u0027s cockpit. He showed him how to fasten the Sutton safety harness: four straps for shoulders and thighs, fixed together with a central pin held by a spring clip. If struck just right, the whole thing came apart allowing swift escape. Not that there was anywhere safe to go at 6,500 feet.\n \u0027A tip, old thing, if you see anything flitting past with a Maltese cross on its planes, fire about fifty yards in front of it. If you point at its side, it\u0027ll be gone by the time the bullets get there.\u0027\n \u0027What if it\u0027s coming straight at me?\u0027 Winthrop asked.\n Then empty your drum into its nose and pray. Because there\u0027ll be a Hun behind a pair of Spandaus with exactly the same idea.\u0027\n \u0027Where\u0027s the camera lever?\u0027\n Courtney tapped a toggle.\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you when I\u0027m taking pictures so you can steady the aeroplane.\u0027\n \u0027You can tell me what you like but I doubt I\u0027ll hear a thing. It\u0027s noisy up there.\u0027\n He remembered his Channel flights. Even on a still day, the rush of wind was a roar. And even in mid-summer, the thermometer quickly fell below freezing. Recalling the stabs of colicky abdominal pain that had made a howling misery of his first flight, he summoned a mighty burp. At height, intestinal gases swelled to double their volume on the ground. Courtney did not pass comment on the big belch, but looked a fraction less worried about Winthrop.\n \u0027How\u0027s our new ace?\u0027 Cundall asked. The flight commander, helmet in hand, was looking over the RE8.\n \u0027He\u0027ll be the Hawker of 1918.\u0027\n The pilot was ragging him. In November 1916, Major Lanoe Hawker, VC, DSO, was Britain\u0027s highest-scoring pilot. Shot down and killed by Manfred von Richthofen, he was the Red Baron\u0027s eleventh victory.\n \u0027Just look after him, Courtney.\u0027\n \u0027Not a hair on his head will be harmed. This I pledge on the honour of Cundall\u0027s Condors.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m a lost cause then.\u0027\n Winthrop no more truly felt brittle bravado than Courtney. It was how pilots were supposed to act, so they all did their best.\n Courtney ducked under the wing and dropped into the forward cockpit, jostling the stick. The movable feast of Winthrop\u0027s Lewis was augmented by the pilot\u0027s fixed Vickers.\n Winthrop found himself facing backwards, but twisted in the cockpit to follow Courtney\u0027s procedure. The pilot checked his Aldis sight and the engine gauges, humming \u0027Up in a Balloon, Boys\u0027 to himself. After tapping the compass to see if the needle moved freely, he confirmed that the height indicator was set to zero and the bubble was central in the spirit-level that showed if the machine was flying on an even keel. When Courtney slipped goggles over his eyes, Winthrop followed suit.\n The Snipes taxied down the field in arrow formation, Cundall at the point. Courtney turned his engine a couple of times to check its air-worthiness, then let the petrol flood in. Most machine failure in the air was due to interruption of the flow of fuel. A ground man clunkily spun the RE8\u0027s propeller\n \u0027Contact, sir?\u0027 the mechanic asked.\n \u0027Contact, Jiggs,\u0027 Courtney agreed, flicking switches as the groundman gave the propeller a whirl. The air-cooled Daimler engine caught at once, belching black smoke and raising a slipstream whirlwind that tore at Jiggs\u0027s hair and whipped everyone standing within fifty yards. The pilot advanced the throttle for two minutes, upping the revolutions, as mechanics got a hold on the strings attached to the wooden chocks jammed under the RE8\u0027s wheels.\n Satisfied with the engine sound, Courtney waved his hand like a swimming fish. The mechanics pulled the chocks free and Jiggs gave the pilot a smart salute. Courtney replied with a wave and manoeuvred the ungainly aircraft into formation with the fighters, which were taking off at intervals of about a minute. All the Snipes were aloft by the time the RE8 got under way.\n There was a lurch and Winthrop was forced to turn round by the rush of wind. A cold blast shot straight down the back of his neck, icy air ballooning inside his Sidcot. He looked down the field at Dravot and the ground crew, their long shadows stretched in front of them. He remembered to clamp his jaw shut to avoid biting his tongue. The RE8 bumped a couple of times on the iron-hard field, then lifted off.\n The jogging shudder stopped and he was excited by the smoothness of the ride. There were no pot-holes in the air. He felt a thrill in his water as Courtney gunned the engine and the machine picked up speed and gained altitude.\n The farmhouse and the people on the field receded. The sun was not yet down and stretches of unmelted snow shone grey. Hat, dreary ground sped by below them. Despite the wrapping, Winthrop was completely chilled. If he relaxed his jaw muscles a fraction, his teeth would chatter forever.\n He moved steadily, swivelling his seat inside his cockpit, bringing the Lewis round with him. The gun was fixed to a scarf-ring, a rail rimming the hole in the fuselage. He wanted to see where they were going. Up ahead, Cundall\u0027s Snipe was a fixed point, streamers on his struts marking him as squadron leader. The other machines flew in perfect formation to either side. Ball and Bigglesworth were at the extremes of the arrowhead, flying only a little forward of Courtney. It must be a trial to keep the nippy little fighters in pace with the lumbering Harry Tate.\n He got more used to the cold. Flying was easier for vampires but a warm man could bear it. The exhilaration was undeniable. In this century, the skies would call to the adventurous as the sea had to their forefathers. It was a shame such romance was wasted in war.\n Down below, in a wasteland where there had been a country lane, a sexless figure leaned on a bicycle and waved up. An unknown friend, though somehow familiar. Winthrop felt kindly towards the anonymous bundle and tried to get an arm out of the cockpit to wave back. The wind fell on his arm like a blow.\n They passed a deep scar across the landscape. He realised it was the Allied lines. They were over No Man\u0027s Land. The ground below was pocked and ravaged as if a dozen earthquakes had struck at once, just as a hundred volcanoes were erupting and a thousand meteors pounding the landscape. Tons of shells had fallen on every square yard. After another scar, the German trenches, they were in enemy territory, Hunland. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-16.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) \n Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
