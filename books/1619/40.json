The new-born Cundall hands were playing cards. Some elders were toying with a plump French girl, exciting tiny squeals from her. She called herself Cigarette, and was shared like a smoke in the trenches, passed from mouth to mouth.\\n\\n Since Ginger had passed on the rumour that Richthofen was truly dead, Winthrop felt like an exorcised ghost. There was no earthly reason for him to remain with Condor Squadron, but he was bound here. Ball and Kate were with him still, and his red thirst - worse, his red hunger- was rising, making him feel like a drunkard for raw meat.\\n\\n His stomach was not improving. He could keep down only small amounts of very undercooked beef, swimming in blood. When sick, he disgorged alarming amounts of ground-up red meat.\\n\\n The scabby necks of filles de joie like Cigarette had a fascination for him but he knew he could not drink warm human blood. He wished profoundly to be free of the dizzying taint that swarmed inside him, colouring his mind red.\\n\\n If only he could kiss Kate again and set things right.\\n\\n A shadow fell on him. Allard had appeared.\\n\\n \u0027Confirmation of our victory. The Germans have made an announcement.\u0027\\n\\n Your victory,\u0027 Winthrop admitted. \u0027You finished the Boche.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was a Richthofen but not the Richthofen.\u0027\\n\\n Winthrop\u0027s blood leaped.\\n\\n \u0027We killed Lothar, Manfred von Richthofen\u0027s brother. No insignificant ace. Forty victories.\u0027\\n\\n The Bloody Red Baron lived. The job for which he had transformed himself was not finished.\\n\\n \u0027I see what lurks in your heart, Winthrop. You are pleased. You want this prize for yourself.\u0027\\n\\n Winthrop did not try to blind the American with talk of all for one and one for all and winning the war and seeing it through.\\n\\n \u0027You may yet have your chance at the eagle,\u0027 said Allard. \u0027And maybe at greater prey.\u0027\\n\\n Winthrop was stricken with shivers.\\n\\n Cigarette yelped through giggles. Allard glanced at the girl, not approving. She was in the lap of Alex Brandberg. His mouth was fixed to her breast.\\n\\n Winthrop excused himself and got up, reaching for stirrups fixed to the timbers for Albert Ball.\\n\\n \u0027I need air,\u0027he said.\\n\\n It was March the 20th, official spring. In France, the weather was wintery. Winthrop stood outside the farmhouse, breathing cold air, concentrating. He still needed his vampire blood. The sense of purpose filled him again. But he was ailing. Every time he tried mentally to get above himself, to sort out Ball and Kate and the rest of it, he was paralysed. His mind was shrinking, intent merely on survival and murder. There was more, but a red mist hung over it. What separated him from the troglodytes? Or from old killers impressed into uniform?\\n\\n Two orderlies struggled through the kitchen door, a long bundle between them. Winthrop smelled blood. The men carried Cigarette, drained unconscious. They left the girl in a lump against a fence by her bicycle.\\n\\n Winthrop went over to see. The orderlies withdrew, wiping their hands as if they had disposed of something messy. The girl\u0027s shawl was wrapped about her. Banknotes rolled into a cigarette-like tube were tucked into her bosom. A spatter of rain, like tears, brushed Cigarette\u0027s face. Red-rimmed eyes sprang open. She reached for the money and pushed it deeper into her bodice.\\n\\n He made no motion to help her. She would not thank him.\\n\\n With experienced fingers, Cigarette felt the bites on her throat and bosom, wincing as she probed ragged tears. She wrapped her shawl about her throat like a field dressing. The wool was spotted with old bleeding. She got deliberately to her feet, strangely dignified, like a drunkard doing his best to seem sober. She held the fence with one hand until she steadied. Her contemptuous gaze took in Winthrop, the farmhouse and the airfield. She was not squealing and giggling now. This girl could not hate the Boche more than she hated the Allied pilots who bled her for money.\\n\\n He tasted blood in the rain.\\n\\n Cigarette mounted her bicycle and pedalled off, leaning low over her handlebars, skirts tucked away out of the spokes. Did she have a family to feed? A husband? Children? Or was she a camp-follower, going wherever there were soldiers?\\n\\n His sudden concern for the girl troubled him, then he realised it was the Kate in him. The rain washed it away. Only a fool stood outside in the rain when he didn\u0027t have to.\\n\\n At sunset, Allard called a briefing. Winthrop knew at once that it was a serious matter. The board with details of the squadron\u0027s disposition was wiped clean. A large-scale map of the region hung from the wall. And Mr Croft sat by the captain, face unreadable.\\n\\n Winthrop sat in Ball\u0027s chair, near Bertie and Ginger.\\n\\n \u0027Mr Croft would like to talk with you,\u0027 Allard said.\\n\\n This was unusual. Winthrop could not recall the intelligence man actually saying a word.\\n\\n Croft stood, bowing slightly to the room, and began, Gentlemen, conflicts of which you were not aware are taking place. A secret war, if you will. We have gulled the enemy. We have allowed him his knights of the air. We have helped build up the legends of men like Richthofen, have encouraged the enemy to trust in them, to prize them above their worth. It has been costly, but - as you will soon understand - a vital strategy.\u0027\\n\\n As Croft rasped, Winthrop burned. It was impossible to like this man. What he seemed to be suggesting was dreadful, that the Allies sacrificed good men like Albert Ball and Tom Cundall simply to lull the Boche into overvaluing their shape-shifting killers.\\n\\n \u0027You know that JG1 are stationed in Schloss Adler. On your last patrol, you brought back intelligence that a Zeppelin was moored above the castle.\u0027\\n\\n A great fuss had been made of that tid-bit.\\n\\n \u0027It is unusual for such machines to venture near the front. This is the flagship of the enemy\u0027s aerial fleet, the Attila. It is the position from which their commander-in-chief will observe their planned offensive.\u0027\\n\\n Winthrop remembered the black bulk of the thing.\\n\\n \u0027Are you saying Dracula\u0027s in that Zep?\u0027 Lacey asked.\\n\\n Croft, annoyed to be questioned, continued. \u0027This is the endgame we have been manoeuvring. We have drawn Dracula out of his lair. We have brought him within our reach.\u0027\\n\\n Winthrop understood what Allard had meant by \u0027greater prey\u0027. There were eagles in the sky, almost as common as sparrows. But there was also a dragon, the dracul.\\n\\n \u0027When the attack comes, it will be the purpose of this squadron to bring down the Zeppelin. Once the head has been cut off the beast, the body will wither. This single stroke will mean victory.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All very well, old thing,\u0027 said Algy, \u0027but we\u0027ve nothing that can climb as high as a jolly Zep. One\u0027s eyes turn to iceballs in the upper climes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He will come down to us. Lord Ruthven understands his arrogance. The Graf von Dracula loves this toy, this flying machine. He will want to be close enough to see his armies sweep across the lines. He feels secure in his guards, his shape- shifter aces. That childish overreaching will be the end of him. You men will assassinate Dracula.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve always fancied a spot of Zep-busting,\u0027 Bertie said. \u0027Damned unsporting things, the Zeps. Bombing civilians and that sort of show.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is not sport,\u0027 Croft said. \u0027This is war. In this instance, this is murder. Make no mistake.\u0027 \u0027What about dear old JG1?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Kill them if you must and if you can, but do not pursue any private campaign against them. The priority is the Zeppelin and Graf von Dracula.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Once Dracula\u0027s killed, will it be over?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is his war. Without him, the Central Powers will collapse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Without Dracula, who\u0027ll there be to surrender?\u0027\\n\\n Croft shrugged. \u0027There will still be the Kaiser. Without Dracula, he will be a lost child.\u0027\\n\\n Ruthven\u0027s man was convincing but his voice was hollow, his focus narrow. Croft said this was not sport but talked of endgames as if a continent of mud were a chess-board. From the air, in the air, Winthrop knew there was no order. Without its head, the beast might thrash until nothing was left alive in the jungle. All Europe might become a country of troglodytes. Winthrop could not think of that. He could think only of hunting hunters, of stalking eagles and dragons.\\n\\n The telephone rang and was in Allard\u0027s hand. The captain listened, nodded, and hung up.\\n\\n \u0027It has begun,\u0027 he announced. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-40.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) \\n Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
