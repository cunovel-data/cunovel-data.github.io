{"id":94528,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"Watching the Hawk\\n\\n \u0027There is nothing here,\u0027 Ewers said, tapping the folder of notes. \u0027Nothing at all.\u0027\\n\\n At Malinbois, a tiny room had been found for him, a cubic bubble in stone. He was issued with a desk and chair, paper and pens. Each night, he was required to sign a requisition form and exhibit a burned-down stub before he could receive a fresh candle.\\n\\n Poe sat, collar loose. Ewers stood, bowed by the low ceiling.\\n\\n \u0027I had hoped for an opening chapter,\u0027 Ewers said sniffily, \u0027and a plan of the entire work.\u0027\\n\\n Poe had hoped for a great deal more. By now, he should have half-completed the slim book Dr Mabuse required of him.\\n\\n \u0027Have you enjoyed much opportunity to converse with the Baron?\u0027\\n\\n Ewers was surprised by the question. Unnerved by fliers, he avoided them.\\n\\n \u0027He is not communicative,\u0027 Poe elaborated.\\n\\n If it were allowed, Ewers would have been angry.\\n\\n \u0027The Baron has not co-operated? Have you been denied interviews?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, it\u0027s that... as you say, there is nothing there.\u0027\\n\\n When he looked at a blank sheaf of paper, Poe saw the grey- blue eyes of Manfred von Richthofen.\\n\\n \u0027You are purportedly noted for imagination. Where there is nothing, you must make something.\u0027\\n\\n This commission was proving damnable. Wonders and marvels were eternally out of reach.\\n\\n \u0027The Baron is, I should say, a cold man,\u0027 Poe ventured. \u0027His reserve is an obstacle to progress.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell Karnstein. Richthofen will be ordered to be forthcoming.\u0027\\n\\n I doubt if orders will help. It is not that the Baron is unwilling but that he is unable. He is not much in the habit of thinking. I sense he wishes not to ponder the darks of his life. Perhaps this is how he has been able to survive. On an unexpressed level, he fears that if he looks down, he will fall ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Alienist nonsense, Poe. The man\u0027s a hero. Heroes have stories. Find his story.\u0027\\n\\n Ewers stood straight to look down on Poe. As he left, he bumped his head on the lintel.\\n\\n Poe was enough of a fixture at the castle to pass unnoticed in the hall where the fliers gathered to pass the hours of daylight. Perhaps he could find the Baron\u0027s life from his comrades. Each must have some story, some insight, which could colour the narrative.\\n\\n \u0027As recording officer, I must be strict with myself,\u0027 Hermann Goring declaimed. \u0027My victory is confirmed but I may not claim a kill. Ball did not die in the crash but at dawn. The British are sparing with details. It seems he was injured. The sunlight finished him off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The kill should be mine,\u0027 claimed Lothar von Richthofen. \u0027If I had not crippled him in our earlier engagement, he\u0027d have been safely home by sun-up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just be glad Ball is gone,\u0027 Erich von Stalhein said. \u0027He was a dangerous man. The skies are safer without him in them.\u0027\\n\\n Poe could not imagine the skies being dangerous for these creatures. In their shapeshifted forms, they were masters of the jungle of the air.\\n\\n \u0027I am afraid there is no confirmation of your kill yet either,\u0027 Goring told Stalhein. \u0027We have found the Snipe but the pilot\u0027s body escapes us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bigglesworth fell separately. I am satisfied our debt is cancelled.\u0027\\n\\n Pilots on both sides were ranked by their score. Some fliers affected indifference but Poe noted how attention revolved around Goring\u0027s chalked display of engagements, victories and kills. None of the fliers of JG1 could match Richthofen\u0027s line of cups, but all had impressive records.\\n\\n \u0027The Baron\u0027s bag is increased again,\u0027 Goring announced, not surprising anyone. \u0027Another useful victory. Captain Courtney.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about the observer?\u0027 asked Theo von Kretschmar-Schuldorff.\\n\\n \u0027The British do not list him as lost.\u0027\\n\\n The intelligence officer was perturbed. The point of the dogfight, from Theo\u0027s point of view, had been to keep intelligence from the allies.\\n\\n \u0027He cannot have survived No Man\u0027s Land. Like Albert Ball, he must be dead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t understand the British, Hermann. Too gentlemanly to lie, they omit information. Who was this observer?\u0027\\n\\n Goring shrugged. \u0027He is not listed as lost, therefore he is not listed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If he made it home then they know all about you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nobody knows all about us,\u0027 Lothar commented.\\n\\n Theo smoked furiously, thinking. \u0027Since they do not claim the observer as a survivor, the British may simply wish us to believe he passed on his intelligence, encouraging us to show our hand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About time,\u0027 Stalhein said. \u0027We should be let loose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Soon, soon ...\u0027 Theo said. \u0027It\u0027s a clever game, and requires a cool hand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I passed over the wreck of the Baron\u0027s RE8,\u0027 Goring said. \u0027There could be no survivor. The British wish to pretend they know our secrets. Typical of them.\u0027\\n\\n Poe saw shapes in the smoke-streams around Theo. The officer was disappearing in literal clouds of thought. Poe tried to follow his reasoning. Pleased his old knack for conundra had not deserted him, he penetrated the mystery just as Theo solidified his own conclusion.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Theo decided. \u0027The observer survived the crash and returned. It is the only possible interpretation of the facts.\u0027\\n\\n The fliers were mystified.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve lost me, Theo,\u0027 Lothar said.\\n\\n \u0027The observer must have perished,\u0027 Goring insisted.\\n\\n Theo allowed a smoke ring to escape his mouth and smiled. \u0027Poe, would you care to explain our reasoning to these schoolchildren?\u0027\\n\\n Poe was surprised Theo realised he too had seen the answer. Fliers hauled their chairs around, very like children waiting for a story.\\n\\n \u0027The key is the fate of Ball,\u0027 Poe stated. \u0027The British claim he did not die in the crash of his aeroplane but later, some way from the wreck, at dawn. In No Man\u0027s Land, between the lines, during a bombardment.\u0027\\n\\n Going snorted. \u0027This I have told you. It is in the record.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who saw the crash?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Only myself. I would have finished Ball by drinking his blood, but there was fire. I judged it unwise to touch ground.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You have not recently been in communication with British Military Intelligence?\u0027\\n\\n Goring snarled, pig-like tusks sharp. \u0027You upstart cur, I\u0027ll have you whipped ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s right, Hermann,\u0027 Theo said, calming the recording officer. \u0027Someone gave the British an accurate account of your victory over Albert Ball. It could only have been the observer of the Baron\u0027s RE8.\u0027\\n\\n Poe, vindicated, continued, \u0027if he gave his account to his superiors, he must ergo have survived and returned to his lines.\u0027\\n\\n The completed puzzle hung in the air. Theo waved his cigarette holder and his cloud drifted apart.\\n\\n Lothar whistled. \u0027Manfred will not be pleased. It\u0027s rare that his little jokes backfire.\u0027\\n\\n The fliers seemed cheered that Baron von Richthofen had made a mistake. Maybe it proved the Red Battle Flier was made of the same stuff as they. Human stuff, after all,\\n\\n \u0027The Baron should have killed pilot and observer,\u0027 Theo agreed. \u0027It may be a great error on his part.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There is still no proof the observer survived, Theo,\u0027 Goring said. \u0027It is most unlikely.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There is no proof, but I am satisfied. And so is Herr Edgar Poe.\u0027\\n\\n The fliers regarded him with a mix of admiration and contempt.\\n\\n \u0027I understand you find my brother hard going? Can you imagine what it has been like having Manfred as an example for a whole lifetime?\u0027\\n\\n Lothar von Richthofen leaned against the battlements. The breeze riffled an aviator\u0027s scarf away from his casually worn Pour le Merite. With white grin, shiny-peaked cap, black leather boots and breeches and loose crimson blouse in the Russian style, he looked far more the dashing hero than his brother.\\n\\n \u0027Even if the gods of battle will it and Manfred falls, I will never be the Red Baron. I will always be the Red Baron\u0027s brother. I have my medals. I have my score. But I fly in his shadow.\u0027\\n\\n The afternoon was overcast but Poe wore tinted spectacles with side-panels. He heard the minute sounds of distant birds more acutely than the nearby din of war. To his ears, the castle was a living thing of creaking stone and breathing wood.\\n\\n \u0027We are very different, he and I,\u0027 Lothar declared. \u0027Even when warm, Manfred was not \"warm\". Given that I have chosen a life of service which will, in all probability, not last long, I feel entitled to take my pleasures to excess. As a poet, you will understand what I mean. But I doubt Manfred has ever been with a woman except for feeding. Even then, he prefers his dogs. And his fallen foes.\u0027\\n\\n Lothar was his brother\u0027s opposite. He described exploits in embroidered detail, making an uneventful patrol one of Sinbad\u0027s voyages. In the Great Hall, he would give thrilling accounts of his battles, performing rather than reciting. Other fliers hung on every word, every turn of combat. It would be a simple matter to make of Lothar von Richthofen\u0027s reminiscences a heroic autobiography.\\n\\n \u0027He is a good soldier,\u0027 Poe suggested. \u0027He flies by the rules, fights by the rules . .\\n\\n \u0027The sacred dicta of Boelcke?\u0027 Lothar said, eyebrows arching.\\n\\n \u0027Manfred has made them his Bible, a manual for survival, for victory. As for the soldiering, it\u0027s hard to say. I fly close to the wind. I was always the boy who got in trouble while Manfred did his duty, or enough of it to get by. But it\u0027s open to debate whether he is really the better soldier.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027\\n\\n Lothar watched a hawk wheel and circle over pigeons. Perhaps he was studying the tactics of aerial predators?\\n\\n \u0027Ask Theo if Manfred is a good soldier. That business with the RE8. You know what he did?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He took the pilot in mid-air and drained him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And he left the observer. The man could not possibly have got control of the aircraft. Imagine his panic, his fear, as the RE8 went into a spin. Consider his frustration, his powerlessness.\u0027\\n\\n Poe thought it must be like being buried alive. Having written of the condition while warm, he had experienced it upon his turning. The stinking closeness still tormented his imaginings. No, that was a more protracted fate. To go down in an aeroplane must be like waking in a coffin as it is conveyed into the furnace of a crematorium.\\n\\n \u0027To Manfred, that man\u0027s fear was almost as rich as the pilot\u0027s blood. He feeds on that as he feeds on the fawning of his admirers. Secretly, he is delighted you are to write this book.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That is not my impression.\u0027\\n\\n Lothar\u0027s grin was wolfish. \u0027Make no mistake. He has heard of you, Poe. If only for The Battle of St Petersburg. You\u0027ve been well chosen.\u0027\\n\\n One of the hawks took one of the pigeons. Poe heard the tiny neck snap. The sensations of the world crowded in on him. Little sounds from the countryside all around. The water lapping in the lake. Footsteps on frozen grass.\\n\\n \u0027It was impossible that the British observer could survive, but in war the impossible is commonplace. It is customary to kill one\u0027s foe as many times as possible, to be sure. It was important the observer be killed. It was the primary objective of the flight. Yet Manfred took delight in torturing him rather than going for a clean, certain kill. His pleasure, his feeding, his score... these were more important to him than executing his mission. In this case, that may have consequences we shall all regret.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This must be a constant complaint against heroes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am a hero too, Poe,\u0027 Lothar said, hands on hips, a deadly Adonis. \u0027I concede you are right. This is a part of all of us. Certainly, all of us in JG1. But it is all of Manfred. He is not a man, he is a weapon. I love him for he is my brother, but I would not trade hearts with him, not for his score, not for his fame.\u0027\\n\\n The hawk soared higher. Poe and Lothar both followed its path, turning to keep the bird in in their sights.\\n\\n \u0027Manfred kills, Poe. That is what he does. That is what he is.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-29.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) \\n Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
