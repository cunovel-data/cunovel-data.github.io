{"id":94502,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Past Midnight\n Courtney kept winding the gramophone and setting the needle back to the beginning. \u0027Poor Butterfly\u0027 was the only record in the billet. Winthrop wondered if the choice struck anyone else as unhealthy. Butterfly kept waiting but Pinkerton never came back, the swine. Every three minutes, the unfortunate Cio-Cio-San wasted away, drained cold and abandoned by her vampire lover. The story always upset Winthrop, and this version, distilled to a few verses, was the most concentratedly upsetting.\n \u0027We used to have a rare selection,\u0027 Williamson claimed, when Winthrop voiced a complaint at the limited repertoire. \u0027The Bohemian Girl, Chu Chin Chow, \"Take a Pair of Crimson Eyes\"...\u0027\n \u0027But there was a binge and they all got smashed,\u0027 said Bertie.\n \u0027I miss The Vampyres of Venice,\u0027 said Ginger.\n \u0027Heroic binge, though,\u0027 Courtney said. \u0027A veritable binge of binges. The demoiselles can still feel the bites.\u0027\n The record finished and the gramophone stuttered, hissing. Courtney lifted the needle. \u0027Poor Butterfly\u0027 started again.\n The bridge game had evaporated. The pilots lounged in the mess, not talking of Red Albright, regarding Winthrop with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. He fancied some of the vampires looked at him hungrily.\n \u0027Will you be permanent?\u0027 Bigglesworth asked.\n \u0027Nothing\u0027s permanent,\u0027 Courtney got in. \u0027Not even immortality.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m given to understand that I\u0027m to be your liaison with Diogenes in place of Captain Spenser.\u0027\n \u0027Oh joy,\u0027 said Brown, a sour Canadian.\n \u0027Mind your head then,\u0027 said Williamson.\n \u0027I intend to.\u0027\n \u0027Deuced mysterious, Diogenes,\u0027 Courtney commented. \u0027It\u0027s hard to see a pattern in what they ask of us. Photograph a road here, bomb a bridge there, bring down a balloon, convey a silent passenger over the lines ...\u0027\n \u0027\"Ours not to reason why\",\u0027 Bertie said.\n Courtney snarled humorously.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know any more than you do,\u0027 Winthrop felt obliged to say. \u0027It\u0027s intelligence. It\u0027s supposed to be mysterious. *\n \u0027Sometimes I think we\u0027re split-arsing around just to confuse the Hun,\u0027 said Courtney. \u0027Playing some complicated practical joke.\u0027\n \u0027Then why isn\u0027t it funny?\u0027 asked Williamson.\n Winthrop looked at his watch three or four times a minute. Midnight did not seem to get nearer. He overcame an instinct to hold the timepiece to his ear to make sure it still ticked.\n The record started again. Lacey returned from a trip upstairs to visit \u0027mademoiselle\u0027. The Englishman, one of the Bigglesworth clique, was quickened after feeding, eyes darting, sharp fingers fidgeting.\n Allard laughed again, like glass scraping bone.\n \u0027First name on the list,\u0027 he mused. \u0027Last week, that would have been me. I\u0027d be flying out to the chateau.\u0027\n \u0027You were right to complain,\u0027 said Cundall.\n Allard was silent. He leaned into a nook, disappearing in shadow.\n \u0027They used to misspell Allard\u0027s name,\u0027 Cundall explained. \u0027They\u0027d miss an L and he\u0027d be A-L-A-R-D. Put him ahead of Albright on the roster. He threw a squawk and Lieutenant- Colonel Raymond issued a stern notice to the fool typists at Wing. They\u0027ve started spelling it properly.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps you\u0027ll make it to the top again,\u0027 said Courtney. Nobody laughed.\n \u0027You ought to be a pilot,\u0027 Cundall said to Winthrop. \u0027Begins with a W. You\u0027d never have to go up. Williamson would be in the air before you.\u0027\n Picking the first name on the list was a fatuous idea. But any other choice would have been as arbitrary. Cundall\u0027s ragging irked Winthrop. It was the flight commander\u0027s responsibility, no matter that he had manipulated someone else into making the decision.\n Even the vampires were restless, jittery. Conversation took silly turns. Bertie and Lacey compared eccentric, fearsome aunts.\n Winthrop thought of Spenser, wondering what made a man drive nails into his own brain. As he was taken away, Spenser was smiling. He seemed not to be in pain.\n There was a long-case clock in the room, face cracked across, stopped at ten to seven. Winthrop alternated looking at the broken clock and his watch. It was twenty to midnight.\n The Chateau du Malinbois was forty miles off. An SE5a could make a hundred and twenty miles an hour but flying above the cloud, navigating by the stars, Albright would go slower. It might take several dips to look at the land before he found the objective. Captain Midnight was only human, even if a vampire.\n If Albright wasn\u0027t back by twelve, it didn\u0027t mean he wasn\u0027t coming home.\n \u0027Poor Butterfly\u0027 slowed and Courtney wound her up again. After a comically sped-up squeak, she settled into her usual rut.\n Waiting, waiting. Wasting, wasting.\n Winthrop thought of Catriona. He must write and tell her his duties had changed. He could not mention Diogenes, of course. Also, the censors would blank anything about Spenser. No wonder the army provided form postcards; fill in the gaps, strike out anything that didn\u0027t apply and sign your name. He missed being able to talk things through with Cat. She had a keen intellect and usually found a different way of looking at a thing.\n \u0027Two minutes to,\u0027 Williamson said.\n Winthrop checked his watch. Time had lurched forward. After a moment lasting a quarter of an hour, a quarter of an hour had gone in a moment.\n \u0027I think I hear him,\u0027 Bertie said.\n Courtney, swift as a snake, lifted the needle from the record, cutting off \u0027Poor Butterfly\u0027 in mid-waste. Winthrop heard noises in his head and the everlasting shelling, but nothing more. Then, perhaps, something.\n With exaggeratedly casual gait, Cundall ambled over and opened the door. There was definitely a distant sound, a whine or a rumble.\n \u0027He\u0027ll be on the dot,\u0027 Courtney said. \u0027Captain Midnight returns.\u0027\n Cundall stepped outside and everyone followed, elated. Light strayed across the field from the open door. A tall figure stared into the sky. Dravot had stayed at his post all the time. Winthrop would not have been surprised if an icicle had hung from the sergeant\u0027s nose.\n Nobody had said they thought Albright would not make it home, so they couldn\u0027t now be relieved when he did.\n \u0027It\u0027s an SE5a all right,\u0027 Williamson said. \u0027No mistaking that cough.\u0027\n Winthrop saw the black bubble outlines of the clouds. He strained to see more.\n \u0027There, look,\u0027 Ball said, extending an arm that kinked at the elbow and wrist.\n Something dipped out of cloud. Winthrop heard the engine clearly. He realised he was holding his breath and exhaled a plume of condensation.\n \u0027Can he see the field?\u0027 he asked.\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 Cundall snapped. \u0027Eyes like an owl. But there\u0027s no harm in giving him a flare. Allard, pop one off, would you, there\u0027s a dear.\u0027\n The American, wrapped in a cape, produced a Verey pistol and fired upwards. A purple shell burst high, colouring cloud! from within, bathing the field in violet.\n The SE5a rounded to approach the field. Winthrop had seen pilots stunt to impress fellows on the ground (some who survived dog-fights broke their silly necks trying to look heroes to pretty nurses) but Albright was better than that. Cundall\u0027s Condors probably couldn\u0027t be much impressed by stunting.\n Winthrop saw what excited the press about aviators. They were lone eagles, not anonymous masses. The only knightly heroes in the gash of bloody mud that stretched across Europe from Belgium to northern Italy.\n Violet light failed as the flare came down. Allard sent up another.\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 Winthrop asked.\n Above the SE5a was a winged shape, indistinct in the purple cloud. He heard only Albright\u0027s engine. The shape swooped down, more like a huge bird than an aircraft. Albright put a burst up into its belly. From the ground, the gunfire was a tiny sparkling. The shape fastened on to the SE5a and hauled it upwards. Entwined, they climbed into cloud. Allard sent up two more flares, one after the other.\n Major Cundall\u0027s face, outlined by the violet glow, was hard.\n Engine drone continued for seconds, then choked into silence. The cloud seemed to part. Something fell, whining. Albright\u0027s aeroplane spiralled tightly towards the ground, wind screaming in its wires. One set of wings tore loose. The SE5a ploughed nose-down and crumpled like a box-kite. Winthrop waited for an explosion.\n People ran towards the wreck. The fizzling purple bonfires of fallen flares lit the mess. The tail was snapped off, the remaining wings shredded. Parallel slashes in the canvas looked like clawmarks.\n Winthrop reached the SE5a just after Cundall. They skidded to a halt a few yards away, cautious. The fuel tank might explode. Burning petrol killed vampires as nastily as it did a warm man.\n A crowd ringed the crumpled aircraft. The Lewis gun, barrel still smoking, poked out of twisted metal and fabric. Dravot pressed forward and rooted through the wreck, ripping apart the remains. He found one of the cameras and checked the plate. It was smashed.\n \u0027Where is he?\u0027 Bigglesworth asked.\n The cockpit was empty. No one had seen the pilot fall.\n Had Albright taken a parachute? If so, it was against regulations. It was thought parachutes encouraged cowardice. They were issued only to balloon observers.\n \u0027Look,\u0027 Allard said.\n Winthrop followed the American\u0027s gaze upwards. The last purple faded in the clouds. The flying shape was still faintly visible, weaving this way and that on the currents. It could be some strange sort of batwing kite. Then it was gone.\n \u0027Something\u0027s falling,\u0027 Ginger said.\n There was a whistling and everyone scattered. It was just his luck to be under a bomb when he had a promotion in the offing. He flung himself on cold grass, covering his head with his arms, thinking briefly of Catriona.\n An object thumped into the field, a dozen yards from the wreck, and did not explode. Winthrop gathered himself and stood up, brushing grass and ice-chips from his coat.\n \u0027Good God,\u0027 Cundall said. \u0027It\u0027s Red.\u0027\n The vampires stood in a circle around the fallen man. Winthrop was allowed through to look.\n The twisted thing wore a midnight black Sidcot, ripped open from neck to crotch. A human face was shrivelled on to the skull, lids shrunk from staring eyes. It was a caricature of Albright\u0027s solid features, bled white. In the throat was a sucked- dry wound the size of an orange, exposing vertebrae, pale sinew and the underside of the jawbone. The body was insubstantial, a scarecrow of sticks wrapped in thin linen. Albright had been emptied, leeched of all substance.\n Cundall and the others looked up at impenetrable skies. Winthrop fumbled his watch out of his pocket. It must have cracked when he threw himself down, for it had stopped at midnight precisely. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-3.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) \n Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
