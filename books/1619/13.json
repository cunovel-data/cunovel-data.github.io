The top layer was frozen but boot-shaped holes showed where others had sunk to the knee in viscid filth.\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t see many civilians parading through here,\u0027 said Lieutenant Templar, a handsome new-born with a quizzical eyebrow. The breed prefer to fight their wars from armchairs in Boodle\u0027s.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Boodle\u0027s is not my club,\u0027 Beauregard said, treading carefully.\\n\\n \u0027No offence meant. It shows pluck to come this far when you don\u0027t have to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are right. Would it were that I was possessed of such spirit. Sadly, I do have to be here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Worse luck, then.\u0027\\n\\n The slip-trench was ten feet deep. Its higgledy-piggledy sandbag walls were mortared with frozen mud.\\n\\n A projectile overshot the line, sailed above at a decent altitude, and exploded a hundred yards off, where fields were patched with the last of the snow. Earth rained down. Templar shook like a dog, raising a halo of loose dirt. Beauregard brushed the shoulders of his Astrakhan coat.\\n\\n \u0027A whizz-bang,\u0027 said the lieutenant. \u0027Nasty beasts. Fritz has been lobbing the little devils all week. We think they\u0027re trying to fill in this thoroughfare.\u0027\\n\\n The slip-trench fed men and materiel to the front line. If breached, the blockage would have to be cleared.\\n\\n Another shell whizzed over and banged in the abused field.\\n\\n \u0027Fritz\u0027s calibrations are off. That\u0027s two they\u0027ve laid back there.\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard looked up. The late-afternoon sky was grey, dotted with wind-whipped earth fragments, trailed across with smoke. Faint in the low cloud were the buzzing black shapes of flying machines.\\n\\n \u0027If those bats report back to Hunland, the gunners will make a few twiddles and drop whizz-bangs right where we stand. It won\u0027t be pretty.\u0027\\n\\n Early in the war, a reporter wrote up such a situation in The Times, boosting home front morale with a picture of cheery Tommies capering in the knowledge that the enemy\u0027s heavy guns consistently missed their positions. Devoted readers in Berlin passed on information to the German artillery, who made adjustments with devastating upshot. Journalism was now strictly regulated. Well-intentioned boobs did more harm with jingo puff than iconoclasts like Kate Reed with trenchant criticism. Beauregard would rather have the white cliffs of Dover defended by Kate than by a regiment of Northcliffe\u0027s flag-waving grubs.\\n\\n \u0027Hurray,\u0027 Templar exclaimed, \u0027the Camels are coming.\u0027\\n\\n A triangular formation of British aeroplanes closed on the German spotters. The gunfire was a tiny sound, like the chattering of insects. The aerial battle was fought in and above the clouds.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s one down,\u0027 Templar said.\\n\\n A winged fireball burst through cloud, wind shrieking around it, and streamed towards No Man\u0027s Land. It ploughed noisily into the ground.\\n\\n Air supremacy meant preventing the enemy from using his aeroplanes to gather strategic intelligence. The Germans, and to some extent the Allies, wasted column inches on daring deeds of the knights of the sky, but it was a nasty, bloody business. As things stood, a British observer, unless he ran into Richthofen, was more likely than his German opposite number to bring back details of troop dispositions and gunnery emplacements.\\n\\n Another German came down, slowly as if approaching an airfield. The machine went into a spiral and crumpled in the air as if colliding with an invisible wall. The pilot must have been dead in his cockpit.\\n\\n \u0027The slip-trench stays open to fight another day.\u0027\\n\\n Looking about, it did not seem a particularly notable achievement.\\n\\n It was a fairly quiet afternoon at the front. Both sides bombarded non-committally, but there were no big shows on. Rumours flew that enemy divisions from the Eastern Front were filtering through Europe, freed by the peace negotiated with the new Russia. Naturally, the rumours were true. Beauregard had reports from the Diogenes Club\u0027s associates in Berlin that that Hindenburg and Dracula were preparing for Kaiserschlacht. In a last push to victory, the remaining resources of the Central Powers would be thrown into a costly stab at Paris. \u0027Schlacht\u0027 could be translated as \u0027attack\u0027, but also meant \u0027slaughter\u0027. Knowing what was to come might not be enough to put a stop to it, especially if carefully gathered intelligence was ignored by the likes of Mireau and Haig.\\n\\n Now they were near the front itself. The impact of shells was a permanent low-level earthquake. Everything shivered or rattled: tin hats, duckboards, mess kits, equipment, cracking ice, teeth. Beauregard was interested not in forward positions but in an odd, underground emplacement just to the rear of the line.\\n\\n Some months ago, he had learned Dr Moreau was supervising a front-line hospital, presumably ministering to the sorely wounded. This was the same researcher whose vivisections had earned him repeated expulsions from learned bodies and exposure in the popular press. Beauregard had run across the scientist before, in the thick of another bloody business. By his estimate of Moreau\u0027s character, it seemed unlikely the man harboured a patriotic or philanthropic impulse in his breast. Yet here he was, in the worst place in the world, ostensibly risking his own skin to ease appalling suffering.\\n\\n In consideration of Gertrud Zelle\u0027s narrative, he wished to consult Dr Moreau. If anyone this side of the lines could shed light on the darkness of the Chateau du Malinbois, he was the man.\\n\\n Towards the front, the trench narrowed. More sandbags were exploded. Major earthworks showed where breaches had been shored up. Templar whistled a little tune, a strange chirrup. Beauregard had heard the new-born was a good officer, concerned for the men under him.\\n\\n Three Tommies sat at a wonky table, smoking and playing cards. A hand stuck out of the packed-earth wall, cards fanned in a frozen white grip. After a few visits to the front, Beauregard was not shocked by the grim humour. The unknown soldier was too well embedded to be dug free without causing a collapse. His release would have to wait till after the war.\\n\\n Beauregard remembered a cartoon of two British soldiers chatting in a shell-hole. \u0027I\u0027m enlisted for twenty-five more years,\u0027 one says. \u0027You\u0027re lucky,\u0027 replies his comrade, \u0027I\u0027m duration.\u0027\\n\\n Two men threw in their cards and the third consulted the hand dealt the dead man. If able to bet, he would have won. Aces and eights.\\n\\n \u0027Moreau\u0027s show is down here, sir,\u0027 Templar said, lifting a stiff canvas flap.\\n\\n It was like the entrance to a mine. A tunnel sloped down, shored up with bags, floored with boards, roofed with corrugated iron. An electric light was strung up about twenty feet in, but there was darkness beyond. Treacly mud ran slowly from the trench into the tunnel, but was diverted into sluices. Beauregard could not imagine where the liquid filth ended up.\\n\\n A high-pitched scream came from the tunnel, followed by lesser yelps and groans. The cries sounded more animal than human.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s always like that,\u0027 said Templar, eyebrow raised. \u0027Dr Moreau says pain is healthy. A person in pain can still feel. It\u0027s when you can\u0027t feel anything that you have to worry.\u0027\\n\\n Another shriek was cut through by a rasp like the downstroke of a saw.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s unusual to have a clinic this close to the line, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n Templar nodded, it\u0027s practical, I suppose. But not good for morale. The situation is fearful enough without all this. Some of the men are spooked by the confounded din. They\u0027re more scared of being taken into the hole than of being wounded in the first place. Silly stories go around about the doctor using the wounded as experimental subjects.\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard could imagine. Given Moreau\u0027s reputation, the stories might not be all silliness.\\n\\n \u0027As if there were anything to be learned from torturing wounded men. It\u0027s absurd.\u0027\\n\\n Templar was a decent sort, for a vampire; perhaps too decent. Such saintliness often overlooked man\u0027s capacity for pointless cruelty.\\n\\n Beauregard stepped into the tunnel. A curious miasma filled the enclosed space, a strong sulphurous smell. Wavering electric light made the walls reddish.\\n\\n The lieutenant stayed outside, like an old-world vampire at the edge of consecrated ground.\\n\\n \u0027You can go on without me, sir. You can\u0027t miss it.\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard wondered if Templar were as immune from superstition as he claimed. He shook the young man\u0027s firm hand and walked past the light into the dark.\\n\\n The tunnel ended at a solid iron door. Getting it down here and set into stony earth must have been a herculean task. An extraordinary soldier stood guard. Stooped almost double, he barely came up to Beauregard\u0027s waist. His arms were six inches longer than his sleeves, most of his brown face was matted with hair, large teeth pushed lips out in an apish grin and red marks, like healed wounds, showed in loose folds of skin around neck and wrists. His uniform bagged in some places and stretched in others.\\n\\n Beauregard took the guard for a savage, perhaps indigenous to a South Sea corner of Empire. He might be a pygmy afflicted with gigantism. The war called upon all manner of King Victor\u0027s subjects.\\n\\n At Beauregard\u0027s approach, the guard wrapped long fingers around a rifle and did his best to stand straight. He bared remarkable teeth, yellow bone-spurs in an acre of bright- pink gum.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m here to see Dr Moreau,\u0027 Beauregard said.\\n\\n The guard\u0027s tiny eyes glittered. He snorted, nose moving as if free of his skull. More screams sounded from behind the door. The guard, who might be expected to be used to the noise, shrank in terror, cowering into an alcove.\\n\\n \u0027Dr Moreau,\u0027 Beauregard said, again.\\n\\n The guard\u0027s furry brows knit with extreme concentration. He unwound his fingers from the rifle and took hold of a ring set in the door. He hauled the iron portal open in a succession of creaking lurches.\\n\\n A draught of bloody stink belched out. Beauregard stepped into a chamber hewn out of earth and rock. A row of cots took up fully half the space. On most were patients with terrible wounds, strapped to bloody mattresses. Some stared silently through bandage masks, others keened in idiot pain. A bin overflowed with cut-up uniforms and sawn-through boots. Electric lights pulsed in time with an unreliable generator grumbling in another room. The walls glistened with fresh blood. Everything was speckled. Even the light-bulbs were spotted, blood drops cooked to brown moles.\\n\\n He saw Dr Moreau at once, a powerfully built old man in a vilely streaked tunic, with a leonine mane of white hair. The doctor bent over the living remains of a soldier, prising apart exposed ribs with a steel implement. The patient was a skeleton clad in wet scraps of muscle and meat. Hurt eyes shone in the red wreck of a face. Exposed fangs clashed in a devil\u0027s grin. Beside Moreau, holding down the patient\u0027s shoulders, was a smaller man. Moreau gave a cry of triumph as bones parted. A squirt of purple blood shot into the assistant\u0027s face, smearing his thick spectacles.\\n\\n \u0027There, West,\u0027 Moreau said. \u0027The heart still beats.\u0027\\n\\n West, the assistant, tried to find a clean stretch of sleeve to wipe off his glasses.\\n\\n \u0027I am right again and you owe me half-a-crown.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Certainly, doctor,\u0027 West said. He had a flat accent, American or Canadian. \u0027I\u0027ll add it to the tally.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are a witness,\u0027 Moreau said to Beauregard, the first time he had acknowledged the intrusion. \u0027Mr West wagered it was impossible for the heart to continue to function under such conditions, yet the resilient organ beats still.\u0027\\n\\n Moreau lifted his arm to give Beauregard a view of the heart. It pumped like a squeezing fist, though most of its tubes were severed.\\n\\n \u0027This man could live,\u0027 Moreau declared.\\n\\n \u0027Surely not,\u0027 West countered.\\n\\n \u0027Your debt will mount, my man. Observe, how tenacious these little snakes prove.\u0027\\n\\n The cut tubes writhed swiftly. An artery probed like a blind worm and reattached itself, blood flowing through it, the break healing. Layers of tissue clustered, swarming over the heart, burying it. The pulled-back ribs closed like a trap, assuming their normal formation. A wash of musculature flowed over the bones.\\n\\n \u0027The resilience of the vampire corpus may well be infinite,\u0027 Moreau said. \u0027Only human despair permits death and a man whose brain has been halved can know no despair. Instinct takes over the animal.\u0027\\n\\n The patient\u0027s head was severely pulped at the back. Flesh swarmed strangely around the eyes. Every scrap of the soldier lived tenaciously. Beauregard remembered Isolde\u0027s sad performance. In thirty years\u0027 research, Moreau and his like had not set a limit on the vampire power of regeneration.\\n\\n \u0027But without the brain,\u0027 West said, tapping the area of activity, \u0027the creature has no purpose, no coherence . .\\n\\n Muscle strands hungrily lapped West\u0027s fingertip. He pulled his hand away and watched smugly as a cheeklike slab of flesh formed over a startled eye.\\n\\n \u0027This is not a living man,\u0027 said West, \u0027just a collection of disparate, individually mobile, parts and functions. The template of human form is held in the brain. Without that template, this senseless creature can only flow in a random search for freakish shape.\u0027\\n\\n Skin formed over the patient\u0027s mouth, ripping on teeth and healing again.\\n\\n Moreau\u0027s huge face reddened with anger. \u0027This man is guilty of a failure of will. He has surrendered his grip on human shape.\u0027\\n\\n Moreau stood away from the cot, disappointed and angry. The patient\u0027s jaw hinged open, fangs extending like poignards, rending the new skin. A croaking exhalation emerged from the bloody hole.\\n\\n \u0027The voice is entirely lost,\u0027 Moreau said. \u0027This is merely an animal. It cannot be saved.\u0027\\n\\n He took a scalpel from his tunic pocket. Its blade shone silver.\\n\\n \u0027Stand back, West. This could be messy.\u0027\\n\\n Moreau knelt on the patient\u0027s abdomen, thrusting his scalpel down, cutting warty skin that had already grown thick. He sliced between the knitting ribs and punctured the heart. The patient convulsed and died. Moreau\u0027s fist sank entirely into the chest cavity. He pulled his gory hand free and wiped it on the patient\u0027s bedding.\\n\\n it was a mercy,\u0027 he said, perfunctorily. \u0027Now, sir, who might you be and why have you ventured into my domain?\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard forced himself to look away from the ragged corpse. It putrefied fast, settling liquidly on the cot, dripping over the edges. The very old ones turned to dust. The patient had been a vampire for less than the lifespan of a normal man.\\n\\n \u0027Dr Moreau, you will probably not remember me. My name is Charles Beauregard. We met once, many years ago, in the laboratory of Dr Henry Jekyll.\u0027\\n\\n Moreau did not care to be reminded of his late colleague. Irritation boiled in his deep-set eyes.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m attached to military intelligence,\u0027 Beauregard said.\\n\\n \u0027Only \"attached\"?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Quite so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Congratulations.\u0027\\n\\n West was sorting through the detritus on the cot, picking out bullets and shrapnel. He wore black rubber gloves.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not yet ready to present my findings,\u0027 said Moreau, gesturing to direct attention to his array of strapped-down patients. \u0027I have not had enough vampires to work with.\u0027 \u0027You mistake my purpose, doctor. I\u0027m not here in connection with your current work ...\u0027\\n\\n (whatever that might be) . . but to solicit information which may be of service. It is with regard to another researcher in your field, Professor Ten Brincken.\u0027\\n\\n At the mention of the name, Moreau looked up, alert.\\n\\n \u0027A charlatan,\u0027 he spat. \u0027Practically an alchemist.\u0027\\n\\n According to Beauregard\u0027s sources, Moreau and Ten Brincken had come to blows at a congress held at the University of Ingolstadt in 1906. That suggested the professor was not a man of insignificant stature.\\n\\n \u0027We believe Ten Brincken is the director of a secret project given the highest priority by the enemy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Too much mysticism in the German mind. The Gothic imagination perverts their brains. I don\u0027t deny Ten Brincken is a daring thinker. But none of his results are verifiable. He surrounds himself with Teuton blood ritual. No control group, no hygienic conditions, no proper records.\u0027\\n\\n Judging from this clinic, Moreau had a singular definition of \u0027hygienic conditions\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Moreau said, definitely. \u0027Whatever Ten Brincken works on will prove worthless.\u0027\\n\\n The assistant fluttered around, getting his nerve up to interrupt the great man.\\n\\n \u0027What direction was he taking in his researches?\u0027 Beauregard asked.\\n\\n \u0027Before the war? Crackpot studies of lycanthropy. Arrant nonsense. The old wives\u0027 tale that werewolves have reversible skin, hairy on the inside. Twaddle about animal spirits mingling with those of men. He seemed to suggest shape-shifters are subject to a form of demonic possession. It was all tied to bloodlines. Germans are obsessed with blood, with racial purity, with the strength of ancient vampire lines.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like that of Count Dracula?\u0027\\n\\n Moreau snarled. \u0027There\u0027s an elder who has done his worst to sow confusion. In his superstition, he encourages fools to think of vampires as supernatural creatures. That\u0027s a sure way to stay in the dark.\u0027\\n\\n West finished his probings and peeled off wet gloves.\\n\\n \u0027I heard Professor Ten Brincken lecture at Miskatonic University in \u002709,\u0027 he said. Behind his spectacles, he had watery, nervous eyes.\\n\\n \u0027This is Mr Herbert West of Massachusetts,\u0027 Moreau introduced his colleague. \u0027He has been of some minor help to me. In time, he might have the makings of a scientist.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What was the subject of the professor\u0027s lecture?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The effects of blending bloodlines. Like breeding cattle for more meat and less string. He claimed to be able to induce shape- shifting in vampires whose line does not entail the facility. Also, he suggested his methods could \"cure\" many common conditions and limitations of the undead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Conditions and limitations?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The extreme sensitivity to sunlight. Fear of religious artefacts. Allergic reaction to garlic or other wolfsbane. Even the universal vulnerability to silver.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tchah,\u0027 spat Moreau. \u0027Blood, blood, blood. To the Germans, it\u0027s all in the blood. It\u0027s as if the corpus was constituted of nothing but blood.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did the professor produce any of his improved specimens?\u0027 Beauregard asked. \u0027A vampire who could survive being pierced by a silver arrow, for instance?\u0027\\n\\n West shrugged and looked at the dead puddle on the cot. \u0027It was all theory.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To call it \"theory\", is to dignify muddle-headedness,\u0027 Moreau said, angry. \u0027Only I am doing anything like real work in the field. Ten Brincken is a dunderhead and a dullard.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Langstrom of Gotham University claimed results with Ten Brincken\u0027s methods,\u0027 West put in, \u0027but his experiment ended badly. They still haven\u0027t caught him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I remember you now,\u0027 Moreau said to Beauregard. \u0027You were with that elder girl.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you for your co-operation,\u0027 Beauregard said. \u0027You have been most helpful.\u0027\\n\\n For a moment, he was afraid Moreau would ask him for news of Genevieve. Thirty years ago, he had seemed ready to exercise a scientific interest in her. And his scientific interests always appeared to run in the direction of taking a scalpel to the subject and peering into the works of life.\\n\\n \u0027If you come by them, I\u0027d be grateful for a look at Ten Brincken\u0027s experimental logs,\u0027 Moreau said, in an exaggeratedly offhand manner that told Beauregard how seriously he really took his rival\u0027s work. \u0027Drivel, I\u0027m sure, but even fools can stumble over the odd truth. In Germany there are fewer legal checks to pure research.\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard turned to leave. The guard lurked beyond the open door, his shadow distorted on the floor.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t mind Ouran,\u0027 Moreau said. \u0027He\u0027s been with me for many years. A good and faithful servant.\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard wondered if the red marks on Ouran\u0027s neck were surgical scars. Before the war, Dr Moreau had been forced to leave England and continue his work elsewhere. But this close to the killing ground \u0027legal checks\u0027 were not in operation. Humanity was suspended for the duration.\\n\\n Half-way to the surface, the screaming resumed as Dr Moreau and Mr West turned their attentions to the next wounded vampire. After a few minutes in the clinic, Beauregard felt he should strip off every item of clothing and have it thoroughly cleaned. Better yet, burned.\\n\\n When he emerged from the tunnel, Lieutenant Templar was waiting. Cigarette in hand, he watched a fresh-blown smoke ring drift upwards and apart. Evening crept near. Even the smell of the trench was better than the foulness of Moreau\u0027s dissecting chamber. The staccato chatter of machine-guns cut through the droning thuds of the usual mortar fire.\\n\\n \u0027Getting busy,\u0027 Templar remarked. \u0027How did you like the doc?\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard said nothing but the lieutenant got the idea.\\n\\n \u0027I tell you I credit no stories, but if any of my lads cop one, I\u0027d rather have them dragged through the wire and driven in a bumpy lorry to Amiens than let them be taken down there.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-13.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) \\n Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
