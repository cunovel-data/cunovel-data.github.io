{"id":94532,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"The Killer \u0027My father discriminates between a sportsman and a shooter. A shooter hunts for fun. My brother is, at heart, a shooter. Lothar loves to fly, to take risks. A sportsman hunts for the kill. I find my prey and I kill him, quickly. Each makes me stronger.\u0027 Baron von Richthofen, going against instinct, made a genuine attempt to explain. Theo lagged behind them, saying nothing. Poe knew he remembered the instance when the Baron had chosen to play with his prey rather than kill, quickly. Albert Ball\u0027s observer still rankled with Theo. \u0027When I have killed an Englishman,\u0027 Richthofen continued, \u0027my hunting passion is satisfied for a quarter of an hour. Then, the urge returns ...\u0027 They walked by the lake shore. The day was overcast. All three vampires wore heavily peaked caps and dark glasses. Replete from a night\u0027s stalking, the Baron was more expansive than in earlier interviews. Theo had suggested Poe might find Richthofen more forthcoming outside the castle. To a huntsman, being within walls is like premature burial. An animal was following. Poe heard its quiet rustle in the long grass. It was some sort of small dog. The Baron had also noticed their hanger-on and darted the occasional hungry glance at its position. Last night, Richthofen had stalked and killed four times during a three hour flight. His bag was an RE8 spotter, a French Spad, a Sopwith Camel and a British observation balloon. Six men were truly dead, four of them vampires. The Baron\u0027s score was increased by three victories. Balloons were reckoned separately. The Frenchman, Nungesser, had had a high score. This victory, which the Baron gave equal weight in his official report, would be remembered as one of his greatest. \u0027How would you rate your night\u0027s work?\u0027 \u0027It was good hunting. I drank from all but one of my kills.\u0027 \u0027Which is more important to you, the feeding or the killing?\u0027 Poe regretted the question. It prompted Richthofen to throw up his guards. At first, Poe had thought the Baron genuinely baffled by such probing; now, he realised Richthofen merely measured his words, taking care to say nothing that might alert an Air Service censor. The dog, a sad-eyed white beagle, emerged from the grass and padded over towards them. The cur must be surviving on dead men\u0027s scraps. \u0027The victory counts,\u0027 Richthofen said, at last. \u0027And what is a victory to you?\u0027 Richthofen turned away and looked out over still water. \u0027And what is a lake to you, poet?\u0027 It was an indifferent lake. Murky but not reeking, unbeautiful but not grotesque. A British fighter had come down in it the night Richthofen let Ball\u0027s observer away. Wreckage had been dredged out and fixed to the trophy wall in the castle. The body of the pilot had not been found. \u0027I can\u0027t tell you, but I can tell you what feeding is to me, what the blood of women means . . \u0027Women,\u0027 Richthofen snorted. Theo looked up, killing a smile. \u0027I do not apologise for my nature,\u0027 Poe said. \u0027Though I have been, of necessity, a soldier, I am not a killer by inclination.\u0027 \u0027My brother claims he would prefer to be a lover than a fighter. But he lies to himself.\u0027 \u0027To me, the act of vampirism is a tender communion, an assuagement of solitude, a reaffirmation in death of life ...\u0027 \u0027You lose me, poet. Do you not kill?\u0027 Poe was ashamed. White, dead women haunted him. Teeth and eyes and long, long hair. \u0027I have killed,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027When I was a new-born, especially. I did not understand the nature of my condition.\u0027 I am a new-born. I have been a vampire for only eight years. Professor Ten Brincken tells me I change constantly.\u0027 \u0027But you become more a killer?\u0027 Richthofen nodded once. He drew a pistol from a leather holster and fired once, smartly. The beagle, surprised, was pierced through the head. It kicked, gouting blood from its ears, and lay dead. \u0027Absurd dog,\u0027 Richthofen said, suppressing a shudder. For some unknown reason, he found the harmless animal as repulsive as a plague rat. Theo was alarmed by the casual kill. The shot resounded, assaulting Poe\u0027s sensitive eardrums. A flight of ducks burst from a clump of reeds. The dog-blood smell pricked Poe\u0027s red thirst. The animal was repulsive, but he remembered the sweetness of Gigi. At Malinbois, warm women were sometimes provided for the fliers. Poe hungered. \u0027My country requires I be a killer,\u0027 Richthofen said. \u0027I do my duty.\u0027 in centuries to come, you may change greatly. Your country\u0027s requirements may change, freeing you from duties. You may become a lover too.\u0027 Richthofen, mild and cold and pale, looked directly at Poe. \u0027I have no centuries to come. I am a dead man.\u0027 Poe looked at Theo, puzzled. \u0027I was given to understand that you turned without passing through death? You yourself told me so.\u0027 The Baron looked disgusted. \u0027I do not mean that, poet. I am a truly dead man. All of us in JG1, we are dead men with temporary use of our corpses. It is likely that we will not survive the war.\u0027 Theo\u0027s lips pressed in a serious line. He exhaled smoke and tossed the last of a cigarette into the lake. \u0027It\u0027s Nungesser. You drank his blood. You think his thoughts.\u0027 The tiny coal of the cigarette hissed. I think my own thoughts, Kretschmar-Schuldorff. But you are right. The Frenchman was like me. He knew he was dead. Each victory for him was a reprieve. When I killed him, he was not surprised. He had known death would catch up with him eventually. I knew that as I tore his throat out and drank his hot blood.\u0027 \u0027Do you deem those you defeat your comrades?\u0027 Poe asked. \u0027The tragedy of war is the pitting of like against like. We fliers have more in common with those we fight than with those for whom we fight. I shall most likely die in the air. Oswald Boelcke, my teacher, died in the stupidest of accidents. All of us, us so-called heroes, die. We fall from the sky in flames. Only the plodding dogs will survive.\u0027 Poe thought of Goring totting up everyone\u0027s score, of Ewers pestering officials for advancement, of Ten Brincken taking measurements, of Kurten and Haarmann tending their master\u0027s guns. He thought of Edgar Poe stooping to the writing of propaganda. \u0027Professor Ten Brincken claims he will make you invincible.\u0027 \u0027He follows us with callipers and a stop-watch, prattling of measurements and science. He has never been in the air. He cannot know. There is no science up there.\u0027 \u0027What is there?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re the poet. You tell me.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t make poetry of what I don\u0027t know.\u0027 Richthofen took off his dark glasses. His eyes did not shrink in the sunlight. His face was set like marble. \u0027Up there, in the night sky, is war. Eternal war. Not only with the British and French, but with the air. The sky does not wish us in it. Us, the presumptuous ones, it kills. It takes the Boelckes and the Immelmanns, the Balls and the Nungessers, and dashes them to the earth. We shall never be its creatures.\u0027 He did not look up as he spoke. \u0027After the war, then what?\u0027 For the first time in Poe\u0027s experience, Richthofen laughed. It was a brief bark, like a branch snapping. \u0027\"After the war\"? There is no \"after the war\".\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-33.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
