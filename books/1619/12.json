{"id":94511,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Bloodlines\n \u0027The world has made of me what it would, and I make no excuses for myself. I have followed the dictates of my heart, even when such a course was unwise. I am to be shot as a spy but, in truth, I have scant talent for espionage. You, above all, know that, Charles. I am a courtesan, simply. I am kindly called the last of the grandes horizontales. I suppose that in this cruel century I must be considered a prostitute, merely...\u0027\n The document was the holograph confession of Gertrud Zelle, known to the popular press by her stage name, Mata Hari. Winthrop had intended to defer studying the manuscript but found himself on the train to Amiens, confined in a compartment with a Captain Drummond whose win-the-war tirade was unutterably irksome. The red-faced, beefy vampire was a fine specimen of the bulldog breed, which is to say he was barking mad. An advocate of the \u0027one-big-push\u0027 strategy, Drummond insisted the blueprint for victory was that all the Allied armies should go over the top at the same time.\n \u0027The sausage-eaters will turn tail and scarper,\u0027 Drummond said, grin displaying interlocking fangs in his square jaw. \u0027Your dratted Germ-Hun doesn\u0027t have the stomach for a proper scrap.\u0027\n After four years of murderous, costly squabbling over a few muddy miles, Drummond struck him as insane. A pair of lieutenants, fresh from training, were converts to the captain\u0027s way of thinking. Winthrop doubted they would survive a week in the lines. The Hun might not have the stomach of the Tommy, but he certainly had entrenched machine-gun positions.\n \u0027It\u0027s the only cursed way,\u0027 Drummond said, as passionately thick-headed as a campaigning politician. \u0027One big push to Victory.\u0027\n The lieutenants agreed, swearing to be in the first wave. Drummond had just killed them, and probably all the men under their command.\n \u0027If the fathead politicians would let us out of the trenches, we\u0027d give the swine of Saxony and the poltroons of Prussia the sound biffing they so richly deserve. With the Kaiser hoisted on a sturdy stake, we should shove on into the Russias and sort out the blasted Bolshies.\u0027\n Winthrop imagined the tide of war surging around the world, sweeping through continents like a dreadful winter.\n \u0027Mark my words, the real enemy is the clique of homicidal, alien Jews that has done for the weak-blooded Romanovs.\u0027\n Drummond concluded his editorial and got down to gory stories of Germans killed with bare hands and teeth. Winthrop pleaded urgent business and read on.\n I am Dracula\u0027s get. I was one of his mistresses. When the Graf settled at the Kaiser\u0027s court, he turned several of us. In life, he was an Eastern potentate. Always, he must have a harem. He would fiercely deny it, but his habits are Ottoman. Fortunately, I was a passing diversion. He is uncomfortable with women of this century. We are difficult to bend to his will. He prefers the pliable, superstitious fools of his own time. The favourites, the ones he calls wives, have been with him for centuries. They have child minds and beast appetites, all \u0027I want\u0027 and \u0027give me\u0027 and \u0027now\u0027. I am not of that breed, but I fear degeneration is inevitable. Now I shall never learn whether my bloodline harbours the taint.\n When he turned me, I was his property. His slave to use as was his whim. Even now, Dracula owns me. Dawn will set me free. After a few eternal months in the summer of 1910, the Graf loosened the collar. First, he yielded exclusive rights. I was obliged to serve the pleasure of his Carpathian cronies. Many elders drink only the blood of new-borns. They regard the warm with disgust. I was the consort of Armand Tesla. Before his fall, Dr Tesla was chief of Dracula\u0027s secret police. A cruel elder, his amusement was to drip holy water on to the flesh of newborns. It doesn\u0027t work on every line, but for some this is disfiguring. There is no explanation in science. The admission is unfashionable, but we are not creatures of nature. Vampires are\n monsters.\n When angered, Tesla would threaten my face. Even if I survived, my life as a courtesan would end. But the doctor came to value me, so I was spared.\n Tesla schooled me as a spy and introduced me to diplomatic circles in Berlin, London and Paris. He became second only to the Graf in influence and power, which is why Dracula killed him. You knew that, too. I can tell by your face. A woman doesn\u0027t need to be able to read minds, though some vampires can. It is his weakness, Charles. Anyone about him who shows himself too able, he will become suspicious of. And he will destroy. He is a proud descendent of Attila but nations can no longer be ruled like barbarian tribes. Germany and Austria-Hungary\n the capable men Dracula has assassinated. Only fools and the slyest of traitors survive. One man, even Dracula, cannot hold together such an empire. He failed in Britain and he will fail in Germany. Your responsibility is to ensure that enough of Europe survives his fall to start again.\n Captain Drummond was still chuckling over his personal plans for \u0027Lenin, Trotsky and their unwashed shower\u0027. Winthrop shivered. Dracula was hardly Europe\u0027s last monster.\n \u0027When Tesla fell, I became an inconvenience and was sent to Paris. I was set up in apartments and resumed my life as a dancer. Mabuse, Tesla\u0027s successor, ordered me to ensnare as many dignitaries as I could.\u0027\n The woman was accused of prising the plans for a French offensive out of General Mireau, another advocate of the Drummond way to mass suicide. This was the charge upon which she had been executed.\n The truth is I was delayed and passed on the information only minutes before the attack. If my report reached the German High Command, I would think them too busy gloating over dead Frenchmen to take notice. Mireau\u0027s colossal plan was to attack at dawn. That was it. He ordered twenty minutes\u0027 bombardment to clear the barbed wire and wake the German gunners, then breakfasted on cognac, snug in his field headquarters while a hundred thousand brave\n climbed from the trenches to be chopped up by concentrated mortar and machine-gun fire. I\u0027m a whore with no more notion of military tactics than a goose, but even I saw the plan was astonishingly obvious. Attack at dawn, I ask you! Why not a token feint to draw fire, duping the enemy into signalling guns positions, then specific bombardments to eliminate defensive positions,\n then\n the big attack? Does it not seem strange\n I\n can come up with a sounder plan than the fabulous General Mireau? It is no wonder the ass is insistent I be executed (at dawn, of course), for fear Hindenburg might call upon my services as a strategist. Then again, I\u0027m sure Germany has a surfeit of five-year-old schoolboys who could draw up battle plans that would baffle and overwhelm the good general.\n Kate Reed had said as much in her articles on L\u0027affaire Mireau.\n \u0027Hit \u0027em hard,\u0027 Drummond said, \u0027at dawn! Wake the blighters up with cold silver.\u0027 This was a war fought by ferocious idiots.\n Charles, you want to hear about the Chateau du Malinbois. Very well. It is the current headquarters of\n Jagdgeschwader 1,\n the group commanded by Baron von Richthofen. The press is full of their daring deeds. The expression \u0027Flying Circus\u0027 arose because of the unit\u0027s manoeuvrability. They have the knack of packing everything on to a train and moving to new positions. Early in the war, the Baron defied orders that his aircraft be painted\n en camouflage\n and insisted the machine be bright scarlet. Actually, as anyone who has tried to find a red ball in green grass will tell you, a red aeroplane blends surprisingly with the landscape. And by night, even to vampire eyes, red is black. It may be a surprise to you, but Germany\u0027s sky-high heroes are not universally beloved by their muddier comrades. The press blathers about the aerial feats of Richthofen\u0027s Flying Circus, but ground troops, and even fliers not assigned to JG1, call the squadron \u0027the Flying Freak Show\u0027. The term is not inappropriate.\n Malinbois is also a centre for research, under the directorship of Professor Ten Brincken. From my nights as a bride of Dracula, I recall this scientist as a supplicant at the court. The palace was always full of crackpots of one stripe or another. The Graf is a fiend for modernity, as bedazzled by trains and flying machines as a small boy. The professor, one of a parade of geniuses, was granted a private audience with the Graf. I saw him then, a broad-shouldered warm brute, glowering as he paced outside Dracula\u0027s office. I understood he was not an inventor but a biological researcher. My instant judgement was that I did not like the man. His face was storm-clouded and about him was a creepy aura. At that time, there was a craze among some of the living for injecting themselves with extremely dilute doses of silver salts. Having thus polluted their blood, they felt safe from the thirsty undead. Even had Ten Brincken not taken such precautions, I doubt I should have cared to taste his greasy blood.\n When ordered to pay a visit to Malinbois, I assumed I was to be an ornament. Fliers are notorious for their parties. Germany indulges its heroes, and what greater indulgence could there be than Mata Hari?\n I arrived late in the afternoon and was greeted by Ten Brincken, who had me strip in his surgery. He subjected me to an intimate examination, as if I were a horse destined for the auctioneer\u0027s block. Yes, he graded my teeth. With all manner of callipers and probes, he noted even the minutest measurements. I have no qualms about being naked in public, but I was not comfortable with the professor\u0027s prying fingers. He took a sample of my blood for analysis and placed the phial in a cool cabinet with many other labelled specimens. He asked me to shape- shift, to become a wolf or a bat. I refused. I do not perform magic tricks. He again demanded. In the examination room also was a uniformed officer, General Karnstein. He kindly ordered me to accede to Ten Brincken\u0027s request.\n The Karnstein bloodline, which had its source in Styria, was one of the most distinguished in Europe. The General, one of Dracula\u0027s devoted allies in Austria-Hungary, was elder chieftain of his family-in-darkness. His involvement implied the Central Powers considered Malinbois a big show.\n I changed, completely. I cannot\n explain.\n I simply\n think\n of one of my shapes and my body becomes malleable. I flow into another form. Like most of Dracula\u0027s get, I can take the shape of what I am told is a dire wolf, prehistoric terror of Europe. In Java, I learned the snake dance. I was the lover of a Malay elder, a\n pontianak.\n I have some of his blood in me. It sets me apart from the common\n nosferatu.\n For Ten Brincken and the general, I assumed snake-shape then sloughed the new skin. Ten Brincken caressed the cast-off as if it gave him pleasure, holding it to the light and admiring rainbows in the scales. All men, Charles, are putty in my jewelled fingers, so they say.\u0027\n Winthrop tried to envision Mata Hari\u0027s snake-shape. He had never seen her famous Javanese Snake Dance, but had heard accounts from besotted devotees.\n Karnstein said I reminded him of some lost daughter-in-darkness who could become a large black cat. He likes new-born girls, that one. I knew if I turned my attention to the general, I could enslave him. Few elders are complicated. They may be powerful, but subtlety is beyond them. Ten Brincken filled out his charts and I was dismissed.\n \u0027A wing of the chateau was set aside for those like me, courtesans. Rooms were stocked with unguents and face- paints. There were trunks of costumes. Much of the finery was rotted. I could tell this revel had been planned by men with little knowledge of or interest in debauchery.\n \u0027I was not the only delight at this banquet. Other women and one youth, all vampires, were provided. In the dressing room, I found Lady Marikova, one of the wife creatures who served Dracula in his Transylvanian exile. She had to be attended by Lola-Lola - a sharp, fat new-born minx - lest she get into a snit and murder an admirer. Old vampire bitches are terrible things, but pathetic. Also on the guest list were Sadie Thompson, an American adventuress with dead black eyes; the Baron Meinster, a golden-haired, girlish rake; Faustine, leading ornament of a Venetian brothel; and an elegant elder, Lemora. All whores of no little skill, we had another thing in common between us. We were all Dracula\u0027s get.\u0027\n Dawn broke outside. Trees lined the railway track, many bent and broken. The fields were grey, thin snow layered over mud. The train neared Amiens. Winthrop heard the eternal muttering of the guns. Drummond flinched in the thin light and hauled down a blind.\n Every schoolboy knew the spread of vampirism throughout the civilised world was almost entirely Dracula\u0027s responsibility. Before the 1880s, only a few superstitious souls believed in the undead. Dracula upset the board and set out the pieces in a new configuration. Vampirism spread from him, but his immediate get were fewer than some imagined. During his residence in England, he turned only three: Lucy Westenra, Wilhelmina Harker and Queen Victoria. Mrs Harker, now entirely forgiven and penitent, was his chosen conduit, extending the bloodline wholesale.\n Many claimed to be Dracula\u0027s get but were usually merely of his line, many times removed from the source. So many of the breed gathered in one place was significant.\n Baron Meinster and Lady Lemora, at least, were at the chateau against their wishes. Only one could have so much power over elders. As I said, our father-in-darkness never lets his get go free. We are all his slaves.\n It seemed strange we should have been assembled. I was under the impression most, if not all, fliers were vampires themselves. Surely, a fitter reward for their valiant deeds would be a cattle-cart of strong-hearted, sweet-blooded warm wenches. They are not hard to find. I am sure the allies feed their own heroes in the same manner ...\n So far as Winthrop knew, this was not true.\n At the stroke of midnight - another predictable melodramatic touch - we were escorted down to the Great Hall by liveried attendants. The men of JG1 stood to attention in full uniform before the vast fireplace. Lit from behind by pure flame, the fliers did seem the demigods the press would have them. Many a broad chest was insufficient to accommodate an accumulation of decorations. In this hall, Pour le Merites were as common as brass buttons. The odd thing was that the Circus seemed turned out for a parade inspection, rather than, as I frankly expected, an orgy.\n We were presented individually, announced to the company by General Karnstein. Then Ten Brincken passed among us, one of his infernal lists clipped to a board. Like a dance director, he paired us off. Thompson was assigned to a predator named Bruno Stachel; Faustine with Erich von Stalhein; Meinster with a sad flier who preferred boys, Friedrich Murnau; Lemora with von Emmelman. Ten Brincken conducted business like a pig-farmer supervising a scientific breeding experiment.\n When my turn came, I was offered to Manfred von Richthofen. I believe this suggests my status as Germany\u0027s premiere harlot. Strange as it seems, the Baron did not find the prospect of my attentions especially appealing. Other fliers passed comments or made enthusiastic noises when paired off. One or two couples - including Meinster and his flittery flyboy - were already embracing, drawing gentle blood. Ten Brincken was irritated by this immodest abandon but more tolerant of it than of the Baron\u0027s flat refusal. I confess I was somewhat surprised, even hurt. Any of these fliers could be dead within the night. In such a situation, a man is entitled to what pleasures may come within his grasp.\n Winthrop thought of Cundall\u0027s Condors and \u0027mademoiselle\u0027.\n The Baron\u0027s brother, Lothar von Richthofen, was delighted to be given the Lady Marikova\n her maid Lola-Lola, but distracted himself to try to jolly the Baron into going with me. As Lothar cajoled, I looked closely at Baron von Richthofen. I had imagined a giant but he is of moderate stature. His eyes are ice-blue and something is lacking in them. He is devoted, I understand, to hunting and has little interest in other pursuits. The hall is decorated with trophies of his kills but he is not as boastful as others with lesser scores. My impression is that he is not even a great patriot, merely a pure-bred hunting dog.\n Winthrop remembered Albright\u0027s dry corpse and tried to envision the thing which had emptied him in mid-air.\n Ten Brincken was agitated when one of his associates, a Dr Krueger, pointed out some were getting ahead of themselves. Stalhein\u0027s head was thrown back, eyes glazing as Faustine nibbled him. An attendant pulled the girl away and held her back. Her eyes were red and she had a full set of fangs. She panted like a cat, tiny blood dribbles on her chin.\n \u0027You must not drink from these men,\u0027 Ten Brincken ordered, \u0027you must let them drink from you. This is of vital importance. Those who disobey will be punished.\u0027\n The stress Ten Brincken laid on the word \u0027punished\u0027 was curiously sickening. I did not wish to discover what punishment he had conceived for us immortals.\n Stalhein adjusted his collar and shook his head. Lothar was still trying to coax the Baron, who stood with arms resolutely crossed, Blue Max glinting on his breast.\n As I said, many elders drink only the blood of other vampires. It is a way of taking on the strength of new lines. But the diet does not suit most new-borns. The Circus are, mainly, young in darkness, barely a year or two out of their graves. It is common in Germany and Austria-Hungary for the sons of the aristocracy to be turned in their eighteenth or nineteenth year. The blood of Dracula\u0027s immediate get is strong. The merest pinprick, squeezed onto your tongue, would be enough to turn you ...\n Winthrop had the impression Mata Hari was flirting with Beauregard. He wished he had been present at the interview; so much meaning was lost without the inflection.\n ... and a taste would be enough to madden most new-borns. When\n nosferatu\n go mad, they lose control of their shape-shifting talents. It is not a pleasant way to die. Ten Brincken was playing a very dangerous game. Either he cared not for the survival of these heroes, or else he was confident of their qualities. I have no doubt the first condition is in some measure true: Ten Brincken strikes me as a warm man fascinated and terrified by vampires. But I also think it a fair bet that any flier who had earned a place in JG1 would have the right stuff to taste the blood of Dracula\u0027s get and profit from the infusion.\n \u0027Drink their blood,\u0027 Ten Brincken ordered, \u0027it is important.\u0027\n Lothar opened his mouth, transforming it into a snout bristling with teeth, and fastened himself to Marikova\u0027s swan-neck, chewing flesh, lapping spurting blood with a long tongue. The elder\u0027s wounds healed instantly, so Lothar tore again, smearing his face with precious gore.\n \u0027See, Manfred,\u0027 he said, voice surprisingly human through wolfish lips, \u0027it is not so difficult.\u0027\n Lothar\u0027s clawed hands rent Marikova\u0027s ball-gown, and his jaws tore her breasts and belly. He pushed the elder on to a divan and licked her open wounds. Lola-Lola held her mistress down, whispering soothing words into her ear, gripping her hand like a midwife helping a woman through childbirth. Marikova\u0027s face was frozen in indignation, but she was strong with the strength of centuries. I did not know if I could survive the rough treatment Lothar von Richthofen was meting out to Dracula\u0027s wife.\n \u0027Baron von Richthofen,\u0027 General Karnstein addressed the flier, \u0027it is necessary. For the war.\u0027\n The Baron looked at me without passion, without contempt, without interest. I cannot convey the emptiness of his eyes. Some\n nosferatu\n have a deadness in their heart that has nothing to do with true death. We vampires exaggerate the qualities of our warm days. You can imagine the traits I have carried over and amplified from life. In Richthofen, there .must have been a coldness, a need to retreat from physical and emotional contact. For such a man to be a vampire, to be eternally dependent on such contact, must be very like perdition.\n Winthrop could not bring himself to pity the Bloody Red Baron.\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 Manfred said, the good soldier obeying an order. He stepped forwards, close to me. I saw healed scars on his handsome, square face. Under his cropped hair was a fading red weal. He had recently been shot in the head.\n \u0027Madame,\u0027 he held out his hand. I took it. A queerly boyish look passed across his face, as if he did not know what to do next. I believe he had never before been with a woman.\n Ten Brincken nodded to one of the attendants, who slipped my peignoir from my shoulders.\n \u0027You appear to be in excellent health,\u0027 he remarked.\n Other fliers followed Lothar\u0027s example. Stalhein had Faustine pinned down, and drank from her slit wrist as from a public water fountain. Meinster opened his dressing gown like batwings and moaned in a species of pleasure as Murnau knelt before him, sucking intimate wounds.\n Manfred dipped his head and touched a sharp tongue to my neck. When I say sharp, I mean it literally. Some vampires have barbed points in their tongues, to pierce their companions\u0027 skin. The Baron clamped his mouth to my wound and sucked, ferociously. I felt points of pain and an ocean of pleasure. I was near swooning. The experience had not been this intense since Dracula took me for the first time. I was warm again, alive.\n \u0027Not too much, Baron,\u0027 said Ten Brincken, tapping Manfred\u0027s shoulder. \u0027It can be dangerous.\u0027\n I wanted to push him away but I had to hold him to me. I felt myself dwindling.\n \u0027Baron,\u0027 Ten Brincken nearly shouted, fear lost in his devotion to science, \u0027enough!\u0027\n I shook. My vision clouded red. I was dying again. We can kill each other, Charles. I have seen Dracula do it, and contemptuously spit out in a great stream the blood he has taken. That was how he murdered Armand Tesla. This is true death, from which there is no returning. This is the death I shall meet at dawn.\n Two attendants held Manfred\u0027s arms, wrenching him away from me. His mouth was still attached to my neck like the sucker of a carnivorous plant. With a wet snap, it came free. Manfred shook his head, my blood dripping from his lips. Unsupported, I crumpled. Ten Brincken\u0027s stepped over me to examine the Baron. That told me where I was in his priorities.\n The Professor clapped his hands and called for the fliers to leave off their drinking. For those who had lost control, attendants had wooden-handled devices like tongue- depressors. A touch of a silver spatula causes enough pain to shock a vampire free of red thirst.\n I felt myself lifted into a sitting position. I was as pliable as a broken doll. General Karnstein had taken notice of me. With a pointed forefinger, he slit his wrist and raised blood to my lips like water to a wounded man. I had not the strength to swallow but Karnstein let blood dribble into me. His line is pure and strong, but it was hours before I was fully recovered.\n From the floor, I looked up at Baron von Richthofen. He turned away from me, but I could see the flush of my blood in his shaved hackles. Then, I fainted.\n That night, Meinster\u0027s flier died. Murnau\u0027s skull became that of a huge rat, but his flesh did not change. Bone burst through his skin. The next day, we were sent from the chateau, duty done. That is all I know. You must think of this, for I believe it to be the important kernel of my story:\n has shaped them,\n has given them his blood,\n has made them into something new.\u0027\n Winthrop must have asked her to be more specific.\n I mean Dracula. He is the ringmaster of the Flying Circus, and the Red Baron is his star act.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-12.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) \n Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
