{"id":94535,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"Dark-Adapted\n \u0027It is as if I were about to be dressed down by my parents. You both look so earnest, so cross.\u0027\n \u0027I am your mother in a way you don\u0027t yet understand,\u0027 Kate told Edwin, \u0027and Charles is your father. He brought you into this secret world. It is your duty to honour that.\u0027\n Edwin grinned, not understanding. His smile was easy but his eyes were hard. He was a wall to her mind; given their communion, he must work hard to be so impenetrable.\n \u0027Perhaps I shouldn\u0027t have peppered Rutledge\u0027s backside but I\u0027ve likely saved his life. He was lax up there, careless. He\u0027ll be less so in future. The next fighter on his tail won\u0027t be a Camel. Lockwood got the point.\u0027\n They stood in the shed, between lines of aircraft. Charles leaned heavily on his stick. Jiggs worked nearby, patching the tail of the Camel Edwin had \u0027tagged\u0027. The oily machine smell was strong.\n Penned close between the aeroplanes, Kate saw the beginnings of the turn in Edwin. His movements were quicker. His face was colder. His sibilants hissed slightly, over sharpening teeth.\n \u0027You\u0027ve taken from Kate,\u0027 Charles said.\n Edwin, shame pricking minutely, looked down at the beaten earth of the shed. Then, flaring, he looked up and met their eyes.\n \u0027And I\u0027ve taken from you, Beauregard. And Albert Ball. And others. We all take. That is how we grow, adapt.\u0027\n He would be eating steak nearly raw, swimming in red juice. And he would have an appetite, burning fuel like a rotary engine. He would be always hungry.\n \u0027Don\u0027t you feel the danger, Edwin?\u0027 \u0027Miss Reed, without wishing to be offensive, you\u0027re a vampire. That hardly puts you in a position to lecture me about taking blood, taking anything, from another.\u0027\n The cut in her throat, made with her own claw, stung. Healed over entirely, the phantom wound throbbed, pregnant with blood.\n \u0027Edwin, you misunderstand the condition. You aren\u0027t a vampire.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t wish to turn, Kate. I don\u0027t wish to die. I have a duty and I can best do my bit with your blood in me. I apologise if I hurt or upset you, but there is a greater cause than us both.\u0027\n He looked up through the open shed doors to the sky.\n \u0027Up there lives a monster. I am pledged to destroy it. I owe it to Ball.\u0027\n \u0027Either purge yourself or turn altogether. I\u0027ve seen what happens to people caught half-way between warmth and undeath. You don\u0027t appreciate the risks to your mind and body.\u0027\n Edwin appealed to Charles. \u0027Beauregard, you understand the risks are secondary. We don\u0027t matter. Duty does.\u0027\n Kate squirmed inside. Her blood-links with Edwin and Charles were stirring. She sensed what was going on beneath their conversation.\n \u0027It\u0027s not duty, Edwin. It\u0027s revenge.\u0027\n Edwin\u0027s face closed shut.\n \u0027My blood in you. It\u0027s fogged your mind, twisted your intentions.\u0027\n \u0027Richthofen must fall.\u0027\n \u0027Richthofen will fall. Eventually. Dracula will fall. But it can\u0027t be just you. It has to be all of us. A consensus. You\u0027re becoming like the worst of them. This isn\u0027t a game for a few mighty knights and a million expendable pawns. This is about huge numbers of people, vampire and warm.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re editorialising, Miss Mouse.\u0027\n She was angry. \u0027I\u0027m trying to save you from a great misapprehension. Probably from madness and true death. You\u0027ve been through something very like hell and have focused the blame on one young Hun, when you should blame the old men on both sides who have slaughtered millions because it was easier than living. The getting and keeping of power for a tiny minority in all countries has killed us all, is killing us all.\u0027\n \u0027You sound like a Bolshevik.\u0027\n \u0027If that\u0027s what it takes. I\u0027ve been a Revolutionist, as has Charles.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t see what this has to do with me.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s just it. It has to do with everyone. You see yourself apart from us all.\u0027\n There was a quiet, angry pause. Kate was flushed. Edwin, whom she had almost reached, retreated into the armour growing around his skull.\n \u0027Is this leading anywhere important, Beauregard? I have an offensive patrol to fly.\u0027\n After deliberation, Charles - older now than his years, slower and sadder - said, \u0027I believe you have returned to active duty too soon after your injuries.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m fit. I\u0027m better than fit.\u0027\n Edwin did a deep knee-bend and sprang. He leaped twenty feet, grasping a cross-beam. His boots dangled above their heads. This was the sort of showing-off Kate expected from callous new-borns. The ones who wanted to distance themselves from the warm. The ones who wanted the living penned as cattle, who felt vampirism made them Darwinian aristocrats, princes of the earth. The monsters. Edwin dropped like a cat and stood straight and cool, boyishly proud of his feat.\n \u0027In the first stages, it\u0027s like a drug,\u0027 Kate explained to Charles. \u0027There\u0027s a euphoria. Over-confidence.\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s wrong, Beauregard. I have been careful. I have made of myself a weapon.\u0027\n Charles was tempted to believe him, Kate knew. It would suit the purposes of the Diogenes Club to have this ruthless, agile creature on the books. But Charles was too good a man not to understand.\n I can\u0027t risk you, my boy. Kate has lived with her condition for thirty years. I have to listen to her.\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s so silly,\u0027 Edwin said, turning away. His wide smile was almost hysterical. \u0027I can do so much. We have to destroy JG1. We have to persuade the Boche to stop making those creatures.\u0027\n Kate\u0027s ears pricked up. Making those creatures?\n \u0027You see my point. You are losing caution. You just told me something you shouldn\u0027t have.\u0027\n Edwin\u0027s eyes rolled, in irritation.\n \u0027Why are we having this argument? We want the same things, don\u0027t we?\u0027\n Charles was thinking. \u0027Kate, I want your word that you won\u0027t write anything about JG1 without clearing it with me first. Under DORA, you could be imperilled.\u0027\n She was on a hook now. \u0027Very well, but what is the story?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re shape-shifters,\u0027 he said. \u0027Richthofen and his battle comrades. They don\u0027t fly aircraft. They grow wings.\u0027\n \u0027Good lord!\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re Dracula\u0027s get. By proxy. His blood has made monsters of them.\u0027\n It was Kate\u0027s turn to keep secrets. She understood the import of Mata Hari\u0027s confession.\n Edwin did not apologise for letting the wildcat out of the bag.\n \u0027I shall recommend you be relieved of your duties, Edwin. You need more doctoring,\u0027 Charles said.\n Edwin did not protest.\n \u0027He is thinking of your interests, Edwin.\u0027\n He looked at her and kept his thoughts to himself.\n \u0027Very impressive,\u0027 she said. \u0027It took me years to master that trick.\u0027\n \u0027Your face still gives you away. You blush like litmus paper.\u0027\n That was almost the old Edwin.\n \u0027I still have confidence in you,\u0027 Charles said. \u0027You\u0027ll be one of our best. When you\u0027ve recovered from this taint.\u0027\n They left him in the shed. As Kate helped Charles out into the open, Edwin went to confer with Jiggs, casually poking about in a Camel\u0027s engine, debating mechanical arcana.\n She worried that Edwin had not argued his corner as fiercely as she would expect. Vampire blood was stubborn stuff.\n Especially hers. Perhaps the strain was growing weak?\n In the sun, Charles cringed like a vampire. She hoped she had not made an invalid of him.\n \u0027Let me turn you, Charles. It\u0027s the least I can do.\u0027\n He shook his head. \u0027Not now, Kate.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re not like Edwin. You have the character, the backbone. You could be one of us and not go mad. Unless people like us are vampires, the monsters will win.\u0027\n \u0027This is dizzying, Kate. You argue your blood is poison, then you try to get me to drink.\u0027\n \u0027You are like Edwin. Your mind is made up beyond reason and you\u0027ll stick by it until death.\u0027\n \u0027Pot, kettle, black.\u0027\n Each word was an effort.\n \u0027Idjits, the lot of you.\u0027\n \u0027The warm?\u0027\n \u0027Men.\u0027\n Charles laughed.\n They were outside the farmhouse. Charles pushed the door open with his stick and allowed Kate to step in. He followed.\n Captain Allard, wearing a face-shading hat, sat at a desk, looking over papers. In an armchair nearby was a fish-eyed grey-suited civilian. With a razor chill, Kate recognised Mr Caleb Croft.\n \u0027You\u0027ll have to take Winthrop off the roster, Captain Allard,\u0027 Charles said. \u0027He\u0027s not right yet.\u0027\n Allard looked sideways, to Croft.\n \u0027Diogenes will find you another bright boy.\u0027\n Croft swivelled his eyes from side to side, an implicit headshake.\n \u0027We can\u0027t spare Winthrop, Mr Beauregard.\u0027\n Charles was startled by the refusal. He was on the point of blustering.\n \u0027It\u0027s too dangerous, Croft. The lad\u0027s a peril to himself and those who serve with him.\u0027\n Croft said nothing. His skin was lizardy. Brutality boiled off him like steam.\n \u0027This is too important to take the risk.\u0027\n A contest of wills took place. Croft exuded a damp, invisible cloud. He could sap the lives of others by breathing in. He was late eighteenth century. It was whispered he was once hanged. He wore high collars to hide the rope-burn. Now he was the iron instrument of Lord Ruthven\u0027s law.\n \u0027I fear I have sad news, Mr Beauregard,\u0027 said Croft, each syllable a hollow croak. \u0027Mycroft Holmes is dead. Your Ruling Cabal is inquorate.\u0027\n Charles was stricken. Mycroft had been his sponsor in the Diogenes Club.\n \u0027As a consequence, your operations here are suspended.\u0027\n Croft produced a document from his inside breast pocket.\n \u0027I have the Prime Minister\u0027s authority to take over. You have earned leave.\u0027\n Charles\u0027s face was as grey as Croft\u0027s coat. His heartbeat faltered. Kate had a stab of concern for his health.\n \u0027At least listen to me about Winthrop,\u0027 he pleaded.\n \u0027He is a valuable man. Captain Allard would find it difficult to run this show without him. Your concern is noted but the Lieutenant will remain on active service.\u0027\n \u0027His promotion is coming through,\u0027 Allard said.\n \u0027On your recommendation, I understand,\u0027 Croft said.\n Charles was shattered. Kate did not know whether to step in and hold him up lest he fall. No. He would not thank her.\n \u0027One further matter, Beauregard,\u0027 Croft said. \u0027It would reflect well on your unparalleled record if the last order you gave before you were relieved was to place Maranique airfield off-limits to journalists.\u0027\n Croft turned deep, dead eyes to her, and cracked open his lips in a scary smile, showing green-furred fangs. During the Terror, when the Prime Minister wavered between the Revolutionists and the standard of Dracula, Croft had issued orders that she be summarily executed on apprehension. Another woman, mistaken for her by the Carpathian Guard, was impaled in Great Portland Street.\n \u0027Why don\u0027t you personally escort - Miss Reed, isn\u0027t it? - to Amiens, Beauregard?\u0027\n Charles turned, hands useless fists about his stick. Kate picked up a strong impression: Charles saw himself drawing the silver-coated blade and sinking it into Caleb Croft\u0027s heart.\n \u0027Good day, Miss Reed,\u0027 Croft croaked. \u0027And good bye, Mr Beauregard.\u0027\n Together, they left. Outside the farmhouse, the morning air was chill. The clouds threatened. A flight of Camels rushed noisily past, rising into dangerous skies. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-36.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) \n Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
