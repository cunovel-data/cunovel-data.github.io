{"id":94503,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Grey Eminences \u0027I would appreciate it if Diogenes could enlighten us about the Chateau du Malinbois,\u0027 said Lord Ruthven, admiring his diamond-shaped fingernails. His expressionless monotone always set Beauregard\u0027s teeth grinding. Smith-Cumming, who had doffed his disguise, deferred to Beauregard. He cleared his throat and began, \u0027There\u0027s a definite air of mystery, Prime Minister. We have Condor Squadron on the problem just now. You\u0027re familiar with Jagdgeschwader 1, the Richthofen Circus. At first, we assumed the fuss around the castle was what you\u0027d expect of such a valued unit. The Germans are fond of their fliers.\u0027 \u0027As are we of ours, sir,\u0027 declared Lloyd George. \u0027They are the knighthood of this war, without fear and without reproach. They recall the legendary days of chivalry, not merely by the daring of their exploits, but by the nobility of their spirit.\u0027 \u0027Quite so,\u0027 Beauregard agreed, assuming the Minister was quoting one of his own speeches. \u0027But our heroes are, on the whole, modest men. We do not require the battery of press agents and portrait photographers the German Imperial Air Service employs to puff a Max Immelmann, an Oswald Boelcke or a Manfred von Richthofen.\u0027 The name of the Bloody Red Baron hung in the air. \u0027It would be a good thing if this Richthofen were shot down,\u0027 said Sir William Robertson. The warm general disapproved of new-fangled contraptions like aeroplanes and tanks. \u0027It would show there are no short cuts in war. No substitute for a good horse and a better man.\u0027 \u0027There is indubitably something to be said for the position,\u0027 admitted Beauregard, not stating what precisely could be said for it. \u0027But what concerns Diogenes is that the Circus have been unnaturally quiet since they put up tents at Malinbois. They log victories with monotonous regularity but the thrilling details so beloved of the German press and public have grown scarce. And JG1 has seconded unusual personnel.\u0027 \u0027Unusual?\u0027 Ruthven prompted. \u0027The commandant of the chateau is General Karnstein, an Austrian elder known to be close to the councils of Graf von Dracula.\u0027 Ruthven\u0027s cold eyes evinced interest. The Prime Minister kept abreast of the doings of fellow elders. Among his kind, he was an outcast; his attitude to the better-known bloodlines was not untainted by envy. \u0027I know the vampire. The head of a blood-clan. Hasn\u0027t been the same since his dreadful daughter was destroyed.\u0027 Almost surreptitiously, the Minister for Munitions pulled a large, insensible rabbit from a satchel. Churchill was overfond of his tipple. His particular quirk was to inject Madeira into the blood of animals. He fixed chubby lips on the rabbit\u0027s throat, sucking discreetly. \u0027Drink ... good,\u0027 he mumbled. The rest of the room pointedly did not pass comment. Asquith, no mean imbiber himself, looked thirsty. \u0027General Karnstein has been arranging conferences and parties near the front,\u0027 Beauregard said. \u0027Besides expected names, like Anthony Fokker, we have heard the odd vampire elder has been included. And some unusual new-borns. Gertrud Zelle has been mentioned.\u0027 \u0027Your temptress, Beauregard,\u0027 Ruthven said. \u0027The mysterious and malign Mata Hari.\u0027 \u0027She is hardly mine.\u0027 \u0027You are responsible for catching her.\u0027 Beauregard modestly showed open hands. Though she had featured in many newspaper articles, Gertrud Zelle was not the spy she was made out to be. After all, she had been caught and was awaiting execution. Her \u0027victims\u0027 were mainly high-ranking French officers, most notably the ill-favoured General Mireau. Petain insisted on her ceremonial destruction, though Beauregard had asked the Prime Minister to plead for clemency. It was unlikely: as Ruthven reasoned, the Germans had burned Nurse Edith Cavell at the stake, so the Allies had to even things up and shoot Mata Hari. \u0027We are all men of the world here,\u0027 said the Prime Minister. \u0027I, for one, can think of a reason why the German High Command would see a need for the skills of a Mata Hari at Malinbois. The Graf always likes to reward his valiant warriors.\u0027 Churchill, bloody rabbit back in the game bag, gurgled a laugh. With Madeira in his veins, his eyes pinked at the corners. His great face was otherwise powder-white except for the carmine of his flabby mouth. \u0027There is more to it than a debauch, Prime Minister,\u0027 Beauregard said, tactfully. \u0027The Germans would not be so secretive about simple hell-raising. Indeed, they take pains to inflate the amorous reputations of air aces, contriving romances with famous beauties which last only as long as a pose for the rotogravure.\u0027 Ruthven looked at his advisers and tapped a foretooth with a fingernail. He made a great show of thinking. \u0027Smith-Cumming,\u0027 he said. \u0027What of our old friend, the Graf von Dracula?\u0027 The spymaster consulted a notebook, where everything was kept in a cipher of his own devising. \u0027He has been seen in Berlin. He is to meet with the Bolsheviki at Brest-Litovsk next month. We assume the Russkies will confirm their withdrawal from the war.\u0027 \u0027A pity. I\u0027ve always believed we should defend the British Empire to the last drop of Russian blood.\u0027 The generals and ministers attempted laughter at Ruthven\u0027s joke. Even the dead-faced Mr Croft flashed a manufactured smile. Smith-Cumming flipped a page. \u0027There is a suspicious consensus among our Berlin agents that the Graf has no intention of paying a visit next month to the Chateau du Malinbois. If true, it\u0027s curious such a fact should be so consistently available. After all, no one troubles to tell us when the Kaiser does not plan to visit his barber to have his moustache-tips waxed.\u0027 \u0027Next month?\u0027 Churchill growled. \u0027That is when the Graf will not be at Malinbois,\u0027 Smith-Cumming confirmed. \u0027Has Dracula ever visited this chateau before?\u0027 \u0027Not in this last century, Prime Minister.\u0027 \u0027Do we draw conclusions?\u0027 Smith-Cumming shrugged. \u0027Some convoluted scheme is afoot, without doubt. We are matching wits with masters.\u0027 \u0027With the Russians out of the game, the Hun will launch an all-out attack on the Western Front,\u0027 said Churchill. \u0027It\u0027s the juggernaut strategy Count Dragulya has always practised.\u0027 Churchill favoured a curious pronunciation of \u0027Dracula\u0027. It was not the least of his eccentricities. \u0027Ridiculous notion,\u0027 blustered General Sir Henry Wilson. \u0027The Kaiser don\u0027t have the men or the means or the guns or the guts. Haig will tell you Germany is an arrant paper tiger. The Huns are beaten badly, their heads are off. They can only flounder in dirt and bleed to death.\u0027 \u0027It would be pleasant to concur,\u0027 said Ruthven, \u0027but we do not just fight Wicked Willi. There are others in this business. Winston is quite right. A concerted attack will come. I know the Transylvanian brute of old. He is a veritable Piltdown Man, an unchecked Eoanthropus. He will not stop until stopped. Even then, he must be destroyed. We made the mistake once before of letting Dracula live.\u0027 \u0027I agree with the Prime Minister,\u0027 said Lloyd George. \u0027Dracula commands the Central Powers. It is his will that must be broken.\u0027 Beauregard, wearily, had to concede he too believed a big push was in the offing. \u0027With the cessation of hostilities on the Eastern Front, a million men will be freed to fight in the west. Steel forged in the fire of battle, not green recruits.\u0027 \u0027And Malinbois?\u0027 Ruthven asked. \u0027Might this be his forward post? He\u0027ll want to be in the field. He has a barbarian vanity about such things. He has not entered the lists, yet he must lust to do so.\u0027 \u0027The castle would make a suitable HQ,\u0027 Beauregard said. \u0027If a ground push is to succeed, he would wish to wrest from us our superiority in the air. Therefore, he would want JG1 with him.\u0027 Ruthven slapped his desk, excited. His monotone became a grating whine. \u0027I have it! He wants to spread his black wings and fly. He\u0027ll be up in that dirigible of his, the Attila. He, and I, we know this war comes down to the two of us. We face each other over the chessboard of Europe. To him, I am the Britain that humiliated and scorned him. To me, he is the past vampirekind must outlive. It is a philosophical and aesthetic battle ...\u0027 Churchill\u0027s belly rumbled and Lloyd George examined the cuffs of his striped trousers. Beauregard wondered if millions of truly dead thought it a war of philosophy and aesthetics. \u0027This is our duel. My brain and his. He has cunning, I\u0027ll give him that. And valour, for what it\u0027s worth. And he so loves his toys: his trains, his flying machines, his big guns. He\u0027s like a monstrous child. If he can\u0027t get his way, he will ravage the world.\u0027 Ruthven stood and gestured dramatically, as if posing for a portrait: the Prime Minister in Full Flight. \u0027I see a way to trip the fiend, though. Beauregard, keep worrying at this Malinbois business. I want details, facts, figures. Mr Croft, this would seem a project suited to your skills. You will take Beauregard\u0027s reports and digest them.\u0027 The hatchet man narrowed his dead eyes. Ruthven continued, \u0027We can use Dracula\u0027s nursery enthusiasms against him, draw him into our trap and close our hands around his cursed throat.\u0027 Ruthven strangled the air.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-4.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
