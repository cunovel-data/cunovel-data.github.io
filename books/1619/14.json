{"id":94513,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Kate and Edwin Opposite Wing HQ in Amiens was a small cafe where Kate sat in wait for her prey. Fortuitously, there was a small cafe opposite every site of military significance in France. By now, Kate was on familiar terms with them all. She sipped blood-laced anis, unable to tell from which animal the blood might have come, and kept an eye on comings and goings across the road. There was much activity; Wing was busier after dark than in the afternoon. The HQ was solidly built, a converted municipal building. The trail had led her this far. \u0027Bone jaw, mamzel,\u0027 said an American. \u0027Je m\u0027apple Eddie Bartlett. Private, First-Class.\u0027 She looked at the doughboy over the tops of her blue glasses. The short, grinning, impossibly young warmfellow was confident of an eager reception. The gratitude of French girls was a major incentive to army recruitment in the United States. \u0027You\u0027ve certainly learned to \"parley-voo\" mighty fine, Mr Yank.\u0027 Private Bartlett was downcast. He must have been practising his line of chat ever since his troopship left New York. His comrades brayed with laughter. She smiled and her fangs peeped out. Bartlett apologised incoherently and returned to his friends\u0027 table. She hoped he found a willing mademoiselle before a bullet found him. He was a nice-looking fellow and she regretted being cool towards him. It was not often she was mistaken for an alluring French siren. She liked the taste of Americans. Mr Frank Harris, of course, had been an American, a former cowboy. Unburdened by history, there was a lightness to their blood. She was sorely thirsty. Blood-in-\u003ciMi5 did little more than prick her appetites. Sometimes, she got so concentrated on one of her crusades that she misremembered necessities. She flicked her tongue over sharpening teeth. Amiens was near enough the lines for everything to shudder constantly. The surface of her drink wobbled slightly as she felt each bombardment in her gums. Edwin Winthrop strolled out of Wing HQ, pausing on the steps to return the salute of a dusty sergeant. Kate pretended not to notice, but was so placed that Edwin could not help but spot her. The approach struck her as subtler than making a futile attempt to stay out of his sight. Pleased by his own perspicacity, he might in a burst of male confidence let something slip. For a moment, she thought he might add her presence to his report to Charles and pass by about his business. She tried to send out waves of vampire fascination by mental telepathy. It was all nonsense, at least in her bloodline, but it could not hurt. Edwin made a decision. He crossed the street, dodging a motorcycle despatch rider, and bore down on her. She froze her face, suppressing a smile that might betoken a certain smugness and expectation of victory. \u0027Miss Mouse, is it not?\u0027 She made casual play of noticing and recognising him. \u0027Edwin, good evening. You have not your guard dog about you?\u0027 He looked about. Dravot was nowhere in sight. Even Edwin was not always aware of the presence of his protector. \u0027I dare say the sergeant might be concealed in a haystack somewhere nearby. In disguise, of course.\u0027 \u0027I should not be at all surprised.\u0027 \u0027He tells me you and he are old friends.\u0027 Kate remembered the Terror. Stories circulated about Daniel Dravot\u0027s role in affairs of great moment, stories she had never quite pinned down. The sergeant did his duty by the angels, but when an omelette was to be made he was the sort who willingly broke the eggs. He also tells me you are not as silly as you seem.\u0027 She laughed to cover annoyance. \u0027No one could be as silly as I seem, surely?\u0027 Edwin laughed too, genuinely. He was still puzzled by her. That was good. If he was puzzled, he was interested. As he tried to find out about her, she could learn from him. \u0027Are you chasing some poor general? Intent on wrecking yet another martial reputation?\u0027 \u0027On the contrary, I am composing an encomium to the steadfast qualities of our gallant staff officers.\u0027 He sat opposite her. There was comment from Private Bartlett\u0027s table. \u0027Watch out, pal,\u0027 Bartlett shouted. \u0027She bites.\u0027 \u0027You have acquired a claque?\u0027 Kate twitched her nose. \u0027You are blushing. It brings out your freckles.\u0027 For a moment, she thought the bombardment was oddly regular, then she realised she was listening to Edwin\u0027s heartbeat, lulled by his strong pulse. Her glass was empty. \u0027Might I buy you a drink, Kate?\u0027 \u0027No thank you. I\u0027m not thirsty.\u0027 \u0027I should have thought you were always thirsty.\u0027 Her heart ached sharply. She would like a drink but not the sort Edwin might buy for her. \u0027My associate Charles Beauregard speaks highly of you, too. Though he made sure to remind me you were old enough to be my mother.\u0027 \u0027I am barely out of the cradle. I haven\u0027t been dead for thirty years yet.\u0027 He was going to ask her what it was like. All young men did, eventually. It was a two-fold question: what was it like being a vampire, and what was it like to be bitten by a vampire? The patron came over. Edwin ordered brandy giving her the chance to reconsider his offer. \u0027I\u0027ll take vanilla,\u0027 she said, like a silly girl in a Paris street cafe Edwin hadn\u0027t heard the expression before. She moderated her request to another blood-in-\u003cmi5. When he had sipped his drink, he looked at her and began, \u0027Kate \u0027 \"What is it like?\"\u0027 He was astounded she had read his mind, convinced of her supernatural powers. She was amused and a little triumphant. \u0027It is hard to explain. It is one of those matters one has to experience for oneself. Like war and love.\u0027 Edwin considered her answer and looked her square in the face. Her tinted spectacles were no shield against his gaze. \u0027You are after me, Kate Reed. I\u0027m not sure to what end, but I\u0027m certain you are after me.\u0027 She shrugged. \u0027You have a sweetheart at home?\u0027 He weighed the possibilities and nodded. \u0027Catriona Kaye. We\u0027re engaged. She\u0027s very modern.\u0027 \u0027Unlike myself, a cobwebbed relic of another age.\u0027 \u0027She is a century baby. I call her Cat.\u0027 \u0027And so might I.\u0027 The tang of Edwin\u0027s brandy was in her nose. The anis taste on her tongue did not dull her sense of him. \u0027Does your fiancee want you to turn?\u0027 \u0027We haven\u0027t discussed the matter.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll have to.\u0027 \u0027I like being warm.\u0027 \u0027Not a foolish thought.\u0027 \u0027You are no propagandist for the undead state, then?\u0027 Edwin\u0027s breath misted. There was a February evening chill. The warm wore scarves and gloves. \u0027I\u0027ll take vanilla.\u0027 \u0027Pardon?\u0027 \u0027I am the only one of my sisters-in-darkness to survive. It is a thorny thing, this condition, not predictable. After thirty years, the doctors don\u0027t fully understand it. To turn is to gamble on one\u0027s own strengths. Most new-borns die unpleasantly.\u0027 She had no doubt Edwin would turn magnificently. Even as a warm man, he had a vampire sharpness about him. \u0027Catriona is my name in Scots. Katharine. Are we alike?\u0027 He was surprised by the question. You must have something in common. She wants to be a journalist.\u0027 \u0027Will you let her follow a profession?\u0027 \u0027My inclination would be to insist on it. Her father takes a different view. He\u0027s a clergyman. She\u0027s an agnostic. They\u0027re always rowing.\u0027 Annoyingly, she felt sympathy for Edwin\u0027s inconvenient attachment. Catriona Kaye sounded like an exact copy of her younger, warm self. Only prettier. Kate would not be able to win him away from the other woman and make of him a docile informant. Her career as a Mata Hari was ended before it could begin. \u0027Why the interest in my personal arrangements? I thought you ran more to politics and matters of great moment?\u0027 \u0027Journalism needs the human touch. Tiny insights to illuminate dry facts.\u0027 Edwin finished his drink. His blood would be warmed by the brandy, flavoured strongly. An envelope edge peeped out of his jacket. He demurely pushed it out of sight. \u0027Sealed orders?\u0027 He grinned. \u0027I couldn\u0027t possibly say.\u0027 \u0027I would be prepared to make a wager with you,\u0027 she said. \u0027That I know where you are to be sent.\u0027 \u0027If you could do that, you would indeed be a sorceress. I\u0027ve no idea what is in these orders.\u0027 She knew from his heartbeat that he was lying but let it pass. \u0027What would you be prepared to wager?\u0027 She shrugged. \u0027A kiss?\u0027 he suggested. Her eyeteeth lengthened minutely. She felt little pains, not unpleasant, in the nerves of her fangs. \u0027Very well,\u0027 she said. \u0027You are recalled to London.\u0027 He took out his envelope and opened it. He read his orders, keeping them close to his chest, chuckling. \u0027You have lost your wager.\u0027 \u0027Am I to take your word for it?\u0027 \u0027As an officer and something reasonably approaching a gentleman?\u0027 \u0027Officers and gentlemen make the best liars. Especially intelligence officers. Lying is their profession, just as the truth is mine.\u0027 l\\ could name the odd journalist not unacquainted with mendacity.\u0027 \u0027Touche.\u0027 \u0027You accept you have lost?\u0027 \u0027I suppose I shall have to.\u0027 They stood, awkwardly, and looked at each other. He was not a tall man, within a few inches of her five foot four. He kissed her on the lips. His warmth shocked her, jolting fire through her veins. There was no blood but she had the contact she knew from feeding. It was not a long kiss. Bartlett\u0027s table cheered and jeered. She could not draw anything much from Edwin\u0027s mind. Just a drop of blood and she would know things. Edwin drew away. His hands opened and his orders drifted down past the table. \u0027That\u0027d curl your hair,\u0027 he said, eyes wide. With the swiftness of the undead, she bent down and picked up the paper, presenting it to Edwin. He was in a brief reverie, befuddled by the press of her lips. The paper passed only briefly through her glance but she knew Edwin was ordered to return to the airfield at Maranique and arrange another reconnaissance flight to the Chateau du Malinbois. \u0027Now that wasn\u0027t what you expected?\u0027 Kate said. \u0027I\u0027ll say not. You\u0027re electric, aren\u0027t you. Like an eel?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-14.html","bookId":1619,"book":{"id":1619,"title":"The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2)","description":"Storyline: The Bloody Red Baron (Anno Dracula #2) Continuing the series begun with his novel Anno Dracula, Newman recounts the bizarre events of yet another alternative vampire history and introduces a terrifying new anti-hero--the feared flying monster of the Great War, Baron Manfred von Richtofen.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.jpg","author":"Kim Newman","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}}
