Hope…Hope has been gone several years now. No one has ever forgotten her. No one should ever forget her.” “No one suspected that…” “That I killed my wife?” Jay asked. Thor lifted his hands. “I loved her,” Jay said. He rolled back his sleeves. Thor saw the scars on his arms. “I loved her.” “You tried to commit suicide—and the department let you stay?” Thor asked skeptically. “Don’t be ridiculous. I had an accident. I was on medical leave for a few months.” Thor nodded. “I’m a good cop,” Jay said quietly, and with conviction. Thor nodded, rising. “Are you off? Want a drink? There are some questions I’d like to ask you about some of what I found.” “Sure.” They walked out of the building. Thor felt as if the picture of Hope Gonzalez had been emblazoned in his mind. Because she, too, had been blond. And very beautiful. 10 “D o you have enough ketchup?” Bethany asked. Genevieve hadn’t really needed help shopping, but after having disposed of the mannequin with Victor, she had found herself at the tiki bar where talk had turned to her planned barbecue, and that in turn had reminded her that she had to have something to put on the barbecue. She, Bethany, Victor and Alex had wound up at the grocery store together. “I’ve got ketchup,” she said. “Lots of it, I hope,” Alex said, grinning. “Victor puts ketchup on everything in sight. Including grilled fish.” “Hey, it’s an American vegetable, remember?” Victor said defensively. “Whatever, I have ketchup,” Genevieve assured them. She swept out a hand, indicating the cart. “Beer, wine, soda, water. Ribs, chicken, hamburger, and we’ll stop at the fish market for whatever’s fresh. Fruit salad, coleslaw…” “Salad salad,” Victor said. “Without any of that weird grassy stuff the restaurants all seem to think is gourmet now.” “French fries, corn on the cob, onion rings,” Genevieve continued. “What else?” “Hey, where’s dessert?” Alex demanded. “And appetizers.” “Bethany is baking a Key lime pie. And making conch fritters.” “And we’re having conch chowder,” Bethany put in. “You’re cooking?” Victor said dubiously. “Want to grab some cookies or ice cream, just in case?” Bethany slugged him lightly on the upper arm. He grinned. “We’ll stop at that new pastry shop, too, how’s that? It’s not like we’ll have to throw a bunch of stuff away. We can bring it all back to the cottages if we have leftovers. Pack up some ice chests to take out on the water Monday,” Genevieve said. Alex groaned. “Ugh. Monday.” “I’ll actually be glad to go back in the water,” Genevieve said. She meant it, and she was actually surprised. Was the ghost going to show again? she wondered. The ghost who was not the unearthly remains of the poor woman found on the beach. She was also anxious to find out why she kept seeing the vision—and just what the vision wanted from her. She wasn’t sure how she knew it, but she felt sure the ghost had some kind of message for her. A trade-off? If she helped the ghost, the ghost would help her find the treasure? But she wasn’t in this business for the riches, though naturally she wanted to make a living, just like everyone else. Still… I’m being haunted, she thought. And it was better to face it than to…what? Be terrified, time and time again. “I’m going to be happy to get back out in the water, too,” Victor said. “Me, too,” Alex agreed. He made a face. “But first we’re getting another of the professor’s lectures Monday morning. The one we didn’t get on Friday. Could he possibly be more boring? His students must be ready to jump out the window. And when we’re trying to find an old wooden ship that’s decayed and covered with sand and coral, is it really going to matter if we know exactly what she originally looked like? Wait a minute! We already know that. We’ve seen pictures.” He shook his head in disgust. “It matters,” Bethany said. “Why?” Alex demanded. Victor clamped a hand on his shoulder. “State financing, buddy. State financing.” Genevieve wound up in line with Alex, while Victor and Bethany headed out to bring Victor’s truck around front so they could pile the groceries into the back. She started stacking their purchases on the conveyor belt. She was startled when she turned to see Alex watching her with concern. “What?” she said. “Are you okay?” he asked her. “Yes…why?” He shook his head. “None of my business.” She sighed. “What?” “No, no…nothing.” “Okay.” “But….” “Damn it, Alex, spit it out.” “You’re scared, right?” he asked softly. She frowned. “In what way?” “In a ‘you freaked out in the water’ kind of way, and it’s not like I’m the one you usually spill your guts to, but I’m here and I care about you and…well, hell. Gen, you’re not sleeping with that guy just because you’re scared, are you?” Genevieve felt her jaw clench in anger and shock. “It’s none of my business, except that…hell. It is my business. We’re like family. You could sleep on my couch without me so much as making a bad joke if you need to. Hell, I’d give you the bed and take the futon.” She couldn’t stay angry. His eyes were so filled with concern. She started to smile, but a niggling suspicion still teased at her. If Victor hadn’t played the joke with the mannequin, the next best suspect was Alex. “If you don’t want me to be scared, why did you play the joke with the mannequin?” she asked bluntly. He didn’t flush or betray the slightest guilt. “What?” he demanded. Then he did flush slightly. “Hey, we talked about it, but we nixed the idea.” She stared back at him, wishing she had the skill to know if he was telling her the absolute truth. The clerk cleared her throat to get their attention. “Credit card, debit or cash?” “Debit,” Alex said, producing his card. “No, this is my invite,” Genevieve said. “You’re supplying the house.” “But it was my idea.” “Doesn’t matter to me,” the clerk said, popping her gum, “but there is a line.” “Let me, please,” Alex said. “All right. Thank you,” Genevieve said. Victor and Bethany hopped out of the truck when Alex and Genevieve reached the street, and the loading went quickly. As planned, they stopped at the pastry shop to pick up dessert—just in case. “Even though I’ve actually been making Key lime pie all my life?” Bethany asked indignantly. “Doesn’t hurt to have extra munchies when we’re diving,” Victor told her. “Although I have, um, complete faith this is going to be the best Key lime pie I’ve ever had.” “He doesn’t get any,” Bethany said huffily. “You know I can actually cook,” Victor said. “Never mind, we’re not putting you to the test. The kitchen is too small, and Bethany has already called dibs on the baking,” Genevieve said, lifting a hand as if she were interceding in an argument between siblings. At her house, with the four of them unloading, the kitchen was soon filled with bags. Victor, who, as one of her oldest friends, felt totally at home in her house, mumbled some excuse and lazed on the sofa, flicking the television on. He was looking for sports, she knew. Alex quickly joined him. “We’ll have to get ice tomorrow,” Bethany commented, lining up the bottles of soda and beer on the counter. “This stuff won’t all fit in the fridge.” “Hey!” Alex called. “What?” Genevieve responded. “Come out here. They’ve identified the body on the beach.” “Where is everyone?” Thor asked. He’d headed straight for the tiki bar when he got back to the resort. Jack sat alone, looking depressed as he nursed a beer. He looked up like a puppy when Thor talked to him. “Don’t know. Thought I’d find someone to talk to here,” he said. He pointed across the tables. “New couple at the resort. They’re here on their honeymoon.” He lowered his voice. “The guy is some kind of an Indian, I think.” Thor glanced at the attractive couple across the way and sank into a chair opposite Jack. He waved to Clint for a beer. “Where have you been?” Jack asked. “Around,” Thor replied vaguely. “You haven’t seen anyone?” “You’re really asking if I’ve seen Genevieve, right?” “I’m really asking if you’ve seen anyone,” Thor said levelly. Jack grinned. “All right. I think Zach and Lizzie went up to the Dolphin Research Center on Grassy Key. You know how Lizzie loves dolphins. They were talking about doing that at one point, anyway. And Marshall…his boat is gone, so I’m assuming he’s out on the water, somewhere. The Conch kids and Alex? I don’t know.” Thor’s beer arrived, and he smiled his thanks, wondering why he felt so on edge. Why? How about because there was a murderer on the loose in Key West. He had barely taken a sip of his beer when Jack slammed a fist on the table and laughed. “Hell, I’m an idiot. I know where they are!” “Where?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vision-harrison-investigation-3/page-27.html","bookId":2269,"book":{"id":2269,"title":"The Vision (Harrison Investigation #3)","description":"Storyline: The Vision (Harrison Investigation #3) The gift of sight comes at a dangerous price When Deep Down Salvage begins the hunt for the \"Josephine Marie, \" it seems like any other dive...until Genevieve Wallace sees the vision of a dead woman in the water, her vacant eyes boring into Genevieve\u0027s very soul.
