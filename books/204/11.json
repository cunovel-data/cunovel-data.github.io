The more importantpart of his expedition was partly over when he was able to write a carefulletter to the king and queen, which is still preserved. It is lighted up bybursts of the religious enthusiasm which governed him from the beginning.\\n\\n 　　All the more does it show the character of the man, and it impresses uponus, what is never to be forgotten, the mixture in his motive of theenthusiasm of a discoverer, the eager religious feeling which might havequickened a crusader, and the prospects of what we should call businessadventure, by which he tries to conciliate persons whose views are lessexalted than his own.\\n\\n 　　In addressing the king and queen, who are called \"very high and verypowerful princes,\" he reminds them that his undertaking to discover theWest Indies began in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, which appointedhim as a messenger for this enterprise. He asks them to remember that hehas always addressed them as with that intention.\\n\\n 　　He reminds them of the seven or eight years in which he was urginghis cause and that it was not enough that he should have showed thereligious side of it, that he was obliged to argue for the temporal view aswell. But their decision, for which he praises them indirectly, was made,he says, in the face of the ridicule of all, excepting the two priests,Marcheza and the Archbishop of Segovia. \"And everything will pass awayexcepting the word of God, who spoke so clearly of these lands by thevoice of Isaiah in so many places, affirming that His name should bedivulged to the nations from Spain.\" He goes on in a review of the earlier voyages, and after this preface gives his account of the voyage of 1498.\\n\\n 　　They sailed from Santa Lucca the thirtieth of May, and went down toMadeira to avoid the hostile squadron of the French who were awaitinghim at Cape St. Vincent. In the history by Herrara, of another generation,this squadron is said to be Portuguese. From Maderia, they passed to theCanary Islands, from which, with one ship and two caravels, he makes hisvoyage, sending the other three vessels to Hispaniola. After making theCape de Verde Islands, he sailed southwest. He had very hot weather foreight days, and in the hope of finding cooler weather changed his course tothe westward.\\n\\n 　　On the thirty-first of July, they made land, which proved to be the capenow known as Galeota, the southeastern cape of the island of Trinidad.\\n\\n 　　The country was as green at this season as the orchards of Valencia inMarch. Passing five leagues farther on, he lands to refit his vessels andtake on board wood and water. The next day a large canoe from the east,with twenty-four men, well armed, appeared.\\n\\n 　　The Admiral wished to communicate with them, but they refused,although he showed them basins and other things which he thought wouldattract them. Failing in this effort, he directed some of the boys of the crewto dance and play a tambourine on the poop of the ship. But thisconciliatory measure had as little success as the other. The natives strungtheir bows, took up their shields and began to shoot the dancers. Columbusstopped the entertainment, therefore, and ordered some balls shot at them,upon which they left him. With the other vessel they opened more friendlycommunication, but when the pilot went to Columbus and asked leave toland with them, they went off, nor were any of them or theirs seen again.\\n\\n 　　On his arrival at Punta de Icacocos, at the southern point of Trinidad,he observes the very strong currents which are always noticed by voyagers,running with as much fury as the Guadalquiver in time of flood. In thenight a terrible wave came from the south, \"a hill as high as a ship,\" so thateven in writing of it he feels fear. But no misfortune came from it.\\n\\n 　　Sailing the next day, he found the water comparatively fresh. He is, infact, in the current produced by the great river Orinoco, which affects, in aremarkable way, all the tide-flow of those seas. Sailing north, he passes different points of the Island of Trinidad, and makes out the Punta de laPena and the mainland. He still observes the freshness of the water and theseverity of the currents.\\n\\n 　　As he sails farther westward, he observes fleets, and he sends hispeople ashore. They find no inhabitants at first, but eventually meet peoplewho tell him the enemy of this country is Paria. Of these he took on boardfour. The king sent him an invitation to land, and numbers of the peoplecame in canoes, many of whom wore gold and pearls. These pearls cameto them from the north. Columbus did not venture to land here because theprovisions of his vessels were already failing him.\\n\\n 　　He describes the people, as of much the same color as those who havebeen observed before, and were ready for intercourse, and of goodappearance. Two prominent persons came to meet them, whom he thoughtto be father and son. The house to which the Spaniards were led was large,with many seats. An entertainment was brought forward, in which therewere many sorts of fruits, and wine of many kinds. It was not made fromgrapes, however, and he supposed it must be made of different sorts offruits.\\n\\n 　　A part of the entertainment was of maize, \"which is a sort of cornwhich grows here, with a spike like a spindle.\" The Indians and theirguests parted with regret that they could not understand each other\u0027sconversation. All this passed in the house of the elder Indian. The youngerthen took them to his house, where a similar collation was served, andthey then returned to the ship, Columbus being in haste to press on, bothon account of his want of supplies and the failure of his own health. Hesays he was still suffering from diseases which he had contracted on thelast voyage, and with blindness. \"That then his eyes did not give him asmuch pain, nor were they bloodshot as much as they are now.\"He describes the people whom they at first visited as of fine stature,easy bearing, with long straight hair, and wearing worked handkerchiefson their heads. At a little distance it seemed as if these were made of silk,like the gauze veil with which the Spaniards were familiar, from Moorishusage.\\n\\n 　　\"Others,\" he says, \"wore larger handkerchiefs round their waists, like the panete of the Spaniards.\" By this phrase he means a full garmenthanging over the knees, either trousers or petticoats. These people werewhiter in color than the Indians he had seen before. They all woresomething at the neck and arms, with many pieces of gold at the neck. Thecanoes were much larger than he had seen, better in build and lighter; theyhad a cabin in the middle for the princes and their women.\\n\\n 　　He made many inquiries for gold, but was told he must go farther on,but he was advised not to go there, because his men would be in danger ofbeing eaten. At first, Columbus supposed that this meant that theinhabitants of the gold-bearing countries were cannibals, but he satisfiedhimself afterwards that the natives meant that they would be eaten bybeasts. With regard to pearls, also, he got some information that he shouldfind them when he had gone farther west and farther north.\\n\\n 　　After these agreeable courtesies, the little fleet raised its anchors andsailed west. Columbus sent one caravel to investigate the river. Findingthat he should not succeed in that direction, and that he had no availableway either north or south, he leaves by the same entrance by which he hadentered. The water is still very fresh, and he is satisfied, correctly as weknow, that these currents were caused by the entrance of the great river ofwater.\\n\\n 　　On the thirteenth of August he leaves the island by what he calls thenorthern mouth of the river [Boca Grande], and begins to strike salt wateragain.\\n\\n 　　At this part of Columbus\u0027s letter there is a very curious discussion oftemperature, which shows that this careful observer, even at that time,made out the difference between what are called isothermal curves and thecurves of latitude. He observes that he cannot make any estimate of whathis temperature will be on the American coast from what he has observedon the coast of Africa.\\n\\n 　　He begins now to doubt whether the world is spherical, and is disposedto believe that it is shaped like a pear, and he tries to make a theory of thedifference of temperature from this suggestion. We hardly need to followthis now. We know he was entirely wrong in his conjecture. \"Pliny andothers,\" he says, \"thought the world spherical, because on their part of it it was a hemisphere.\" They were ignorant of the section over which he wassailing, which he considers to be that of a pear cut in the wrong way. Hisdemonstration is, that in similar latitudes to the eastward it is very hot andthe people are black, while at Trinidad or on the mainland it is comfortableand the people are a fine race of men, whiter than any others whom he hasseen in the Indies. The sun in the constellation of the Virgin is over theirheads, and all this comes from their being higher up, nearer the air thanthey would have been had they been on the African coast.\\n\\n 　　With this curious speculation he unites some inferences from Scripture,and goes back to the account in the Book of Genesis and concludes thatthe earthly Paradise was in the distant east. He says, however, that if hecould go on, on the equinoctial line, the air would grow more temperate,with greater changes in the stars and in the water. He does not think itpossible that anyone can go to the extreme height of the mountain wherethe earthly Paradise is to be found, for no one is to be permitted to enterthere but by the will of God, but he believes that in this voyage he isapproaching it.\\n\\n 　　Any reader who is interested in this curious speculation of Columbusshould refer to the \"Divina Comedia\" of Dante, where Dante himself helda somewhat similar view, and describes his entrance into the terrestrialparadise under the guidance of Beatrice. It is a rather curious fact, whichdiscoverers of the last three centuries have established, that the point, onthis world, which is opposite the city of Jerusalem, where all theseenthusiasts supposed the terrestrial Paradise would be found, is in truth inthe Pacific Ocean not far from Pitcairn\u0027s Island, in the very region whereso many voyagers have thought that they found the climate and soil whichto the terrestrial Paradise belong.\\n\\n 　　Columbus expresses his dissent from the recent theory, which was thatof Dante, supposing that the earthly Paradise was at the top of a sharpmountain. On the other hand, he supposes that this mountain rises gently,but yet that no person can go to the top.\\n\\n 　　This is his curious \"excursion,\" made, perhaps, because Columbus hadthe time to write it.\\n\\n 　　The journal now recurs to more earthly affairs. Passing out from the mouth of the \"Dragon,\" he found the sea running westward and the windgentle. He notices that the waters are swept westward as the trade windsare. In this way he accounts for there being so many islands in that part ofthe earth, the mainland having been eaten away by the constant flow of thewaves. He thinks their very shape indicates this, they being narrow fromnorth to south and longer from east to west. Although some of the islandsdiffer in this, special reasons maybe given for the difference. He brings inmany of the old authorities to show, what we now know to be entirelyfalse, that there is much more land than water on the surface of the globe.\\n\\n 　　All this curious speculation as to the make-up of the world encourageshim to beg their Highnesses to go on with the noble work which they havebegun. He explains to them that he plants the cross on every cape andproclaims the sovereignty of their Majesties and of the Christian religion.\\n\\n 　　He prays that this may continue. The only objection to it is the expense,but Columbus begs their Highnesses to remember how much more moneyis spent for the mere formalities of the elegancies of the court. He begsthem to consider the credit attaching to plans of discovery and quickenstheir ambition by reference to the efforts of the princes of Portugal.\\n\\n 　　This letter closes by the expression of his determination to go on withhis three ships for further discoveries.\\n\\n 　　This letter was written from San Domingo on the eighth of October.\\n\\n 　　He had already made the great discovery of the mainland of SouthAmerica, though he did not yet know that he had touched the continent.\\n\\n 　　He had intentionally gone farther south than before, and had thereforestruck the island of Trinidad, to which, as he had promised, he gave thename which it still bears. A sailor first saw the summits of three mountains,and gave the cry of land. As the ships approached, it was seen that thesethree mountains were united at the base. Columbus was delighted by theomen, as he regarded it, which thus connected his discovery with the vowwhich he had made on Trinity Sunday.\\n\\n 　　As the reader has seen, he first passed between this great island andthe mainland. The open gulf there described is now known as the Gulf ofParia. The observation which he made as to the freshness of the watercaused by the flow of the Orinoco, has been made by all navigators since.\\n\\n 　　It may be said that he was then really in the mouth of the Orinoco.\\n\\n 　　Young readers, at least, will be specially interested to remember that itwas in this region that Robinson Crusoe\u0027s island was placed by Defoe; andif they will carefully read his life they will find discussions there of theflow of the \"great River Orinoco.\" Crossing this gulf, Columbus hadtouched upon the coast of Paria, and thus became the first discoverer ofSouth America. It is determined, by careful geographers, that thediscovery of the continent of North America, had been made before thistime by the Cabots, sailing under the orders of England.\\n\\n 　　Columbus was greatly encouraged by the discovery of fine pearlsamong the natives of Paria. Here he found one more proof that he was onthe eastern coast of Asia, from which coast pearls had been brought by thecaravans on which, till now, Europe had depended for its Asiatic supplies.\\n\\n 　　He gave the name \"Gulf of Pearls\" to the estuary which makes the mouthof the River Paria.\\n\\n 　　He would gladly have spent more time in exploring this region; but thesea-stores of his vessel were exhausted, he was suffering from a difficultywith his eyes, caused by overwatching, and was also a cripple from gout.\\n\\n 　　He resisted the temptation, therefore, to make further explorations on thecoast of Paria, and passed westward and northwestward. He made manydiscoveries of islands in the Caribbean Sea as he went northwest, and hearrived at the colony of San Domingo, on the thirtieth of August. He hadhoped for rest after his difficult voyage; but he found the island inconfusion which seemed hopeless.\\n\\n 　　His brother Bartholomew, from all the accounts we have, would seemto have administered its affairs with justice and decision; but the problemhe had in hand was one which could not be solved so as to satisfy all thecritics. Close around him he had a body of adventurers, almost all ofwhom were nothing but adventurers. With the help of these adventurers,he had to repress Indian hostilities, and to keep in order the natives whohad been insulted and injured in every conceivable way by the settlers.\\n\\n 　　He was expected to send home gold to Spain with every vessel; heknew perfectly well that Spain was clamoring with indignation because hedid not succeed in doing so. But on the island itself he had to meet, from day to day, conspiracies of Spaniards and what are called insurrections ofnatives. These insurrections consisted simply in their assertion of suchrights as they had to the beautiful land which the Spaniards were takingaway from them.\\n\\n 　　At the moment when Columbus landed, there was an instant oftranquility. But the natives, whom he remembered only six years ago as sohappy and cheerful and hospitable, had fled as far as they could. Theyshowed in every way their distrust of those who were trying to becometheir masters. On the other hand, soldiers and emigrants were eager toleave the island if they could. They were near starvation, or if they did notstarve they were using food to which they were not accustomed. Theeagerness with which, in 1493, men had wished to rush to this land ofpromise, was succeeded by an equal eagerness, in 1498, to go home fromit.\\n\\n 　　As soon as he arrived, Columbus issued a proclamation, approving ofthe measures of his brother in his absence, and denouncing the rebels withwhom Bartholomew had been contending. He found the difficulties whichsurrounded him were of the most serious character. He had not forceenough to take up arms against the rebels of different names. He offeredpardon to them in the name of the sovereigns, and that they refused.\\n\\n 　　Columbus was obliged, in order to maintain any show of authority, topropose to the sovereigns that they should arbitrate between his brotherand Roldan, who was the chief of the rebel party. He called to the minds ofFerdinand and Isabella his own eager desire to return to San Domingosooner, and ascribed the difficulties which had arisen, in large measure, tohis long delay. He said he should send home the more worthless men byevery ship.\\n\\n 　　He asked that preachers might be sent out to convert the Indians and toreform the dissolute Spaniards. He asked for officers of revenue, and for alearned judge. He begged at the same time that, for two years longer, thecolony might be permitted to employ the Indians as slaves, but hepromised they would only use such as they captured in war andinsurrections.\\n\\n 　　By the same vessel the rebels sent out letters charging Columbus and his brother with the grossest oppression and injustice. All these letterscame to court by one messenger. Columbus was then left to manage asbest he could, in the months which must pass, before he could receive ananswer.\\n\\n 　　He was not wholly without success. That is to say, no actual battlestook place between the parties before the answer returned. But when itreturned, it proved to be written by his worst enemy, Fonseca. It was agenuine Spanish answer to a letter which required immediate decision.\\n\\n 　　That is to say, Columbus was simply told that the whole matter must beleft in suspense till the sovereigns could make such an investigation asthey wished. The hope, therefore, of some help from home was whollydisappointed.\\n\\n 　　Roldan, the chief of the rebels, was encouraged by this news to takehigher ground than even he had ventured on before. He now proposed thathe should send fifteen of his company to Spain, also that those whoremained should not only be pardoned, but should have lands grantedthem; third, that a public proclamation should be made that all chargesagainst him had been false; and fourth, that he should hold the office ofchief judge, which he had held before the rebellion.\\n\\n 　　Columbus was obliged to accede to terms as insolent as these, and therebels even added a stipulation, that if he should fail in fulfilling either ofthese articles, they might compel him to comply, by force or any othermeans. Thus was he hampered in the very position where, by the king\u0027sorders, and indeed, one would say, by the right of discovery, he was thesupreme master.\\n\\n 　　For himself, he determined to return with Bartholomew to Spain, andhe made some preparations to do so. But at this time he learned, from thewestern part of the island, that four strange ships had arrived there. Hecould not feel that it was safe to leave the colony in such a condition oflatent rebellion as he knew it to be in; he wrote again to the sovereigns,and said directly that his capitulation with the rebels had been extorted byforce, and that he did not consider that the sovereigns, or that he himself,were bound by it. He pressed some of the requests which he had madebefore, and asked that his son Diego, who was no longer a boy, might be sent out to him.\\n\\n 　　It proved that the ships which had arrived at the west of the islandwere under the command of Ojeda, who will be remembered as a boldcavalier in the adventures of the second voyage. Acting under a generalpermission which had been given for private adventurers, Ojeda hadbrought out this squadron, and, when Columbus communicated with him,was engaged in cutting dye-woods and shipping slaves.\\n\\n 　　Columbus sent Roldan, who had been the head of the rebels, to inquireon what ground he was there. Ojeda produced a license signed by Fonseca,authorizing him to sail on a voyage of discovery. It proved thatColumbus\u0027s letters describing the pearls of Paria had awakened curiosityand enthusiasm, and, while the crown had passed them by so coldly, Ojedaand a body of adventurers had obtained a license and had fitted out fourships for adventure. The special interest of this voyage for us, is that it issupposed that Vespucci, a Florentine merchant, made at this time his firstexpedition to America.\\n\\n 　　Vespucci was not a professional seaman, but he was interested ingeography, and had made many voyages before this time. So soon as itwas announced that Ojeda was on the coast, the rebels of San Domingoselected him as a new leader. He announced to Columbus, rather coolly,that he could probably redress the grievances which these men had. Heundoubtedly knew that he had the protection of Fonseca at home.\\n\\n 　　Fortunately for Columbus, Roldan did not mean to give up his place as\"leader of the opposition;\" and it may be said that the difficulty betweenthe two was a certain advantage to Columbus in maintaining his authority.\\n\\n 　　Meanwhile, all wishes on his part to continue his discoveries werefutile, while he was engaged in the almost hopeless duty of reconcilingvarious adventurers and conciliating people who had no interests but theirown. In Spain, his enemies were doing everything in their power toundermine his reputation. His statements were read more and more coldly,and at last, on the twenty-first and twenty-sixth of May, 1499, letters werewritten to him instructing him to deliver into the hands of Bobadilla, a newcommandant, all the fortresses any ships, houses and other royal propertywhich he held, and to give faith and obedience to any instructions given by Bobadilla. That is to say, Bobadilla was sent out as a commander who wasto take precedence of every one on the spot. He was an officer of the royalhousehold, probably a favorite at court, and was selected for the difficulttask of reconciling all difficulties, and bringing the new colony into loyalallegiance to the crown. He sailed for San Domingo in the middle of July,1500, and arrived on the twenty-third of August.\\n\\n 　　On his arrival, he found that Columbus and his brother Bartholomewwere both absent from the city, being in fact engaged in efforts to set whatmay be called the provinces in order. The young Diego Columbus wascommander in their absence. The morning after he arrived, Bobadillaattended mass, and then, with the people assembled around the door of thechurch, he directed that his commission should be read. He was toinvestigate the rebellion, he was to seize the persons of delinquents andpunish them with rigor, and he was to command the Admiral to assist himin these duties.\\n\\n 　　He then bade Diego surrender to him certain prisoners, and orderedthat their accusers should appear before him. To this Diego replied that hisbrother held superior powers to any which Bobadilla could possess; heasked for a copy of the commission, which was declined, until Columbushimself should arrive. Bobadilla then took the oath of office, and produced,for the first time, the order which has been described above, orderingColumbus to deliver up all the royal property. He won the popular favorby reading an order which directed him to pay all arrears of wages due toall persons in the royal service.\\n\\n 　　But when he came before the fortress, he found that the commanderdeclined to surrender it. He said he held the fortress for the king by thecommand of the Admiral, and would not deliver it until he should arrive.\\n\\n 　　Bobadilla, however, \"assailed the portal;\" that is to say, he broke open thegate. No one offered any opposition, and the commander and his first-lieutenant were taken prisoners. He went farther, taking up his residence inColumbus\u0027s house, and seizing his papers. So soon as Columbus receivedaccount of Bobadilla\u0027s arrival, he wrote to him in careful terms,welcoming him to the island. He cautioned him against precipitatemeasures, told him that he himself was on the point of going to Spain, and that he would soon leave him in command, with everything explained.\\n\\n 　　Bobadilla gave no answer to these letters; and when Columbus receivedfrom the sovereigns the letter of the twenty-sixth of May, he made nolonger any hesitation, but reported in person at the city of San Domingo.\\n\\n 　　He traveled without guards or retinue, but Bobadilla had made hostilepreparations, as if Columbus meant to come with military force. Columbuspreferred to show his own loyalty to the crown and to remove suspicion.\\n\\n 　　But no sooner did he arrive in the city than Bobadilla gave orders that heshould be put in irons and confined in the fortress. Up to this moment,Bobadilla had been sustained by the popular favor of those around him;but the indignity, of placing chains upon Columbus, seems to have made achange in the fickle impressions of the little town.\\n\\n 　　Columbus, himself, behaved with magnanimity, and made nocomplaint. Bobadilla asked him to bid his brother return to San Domingo,and he complied. He begged his brother to submit to the authority of thesovereigns, and Bartholomew immediately did so. On his arrival in SanDomingo he was also put in irons, as his brother Diego had been, and wasconfined on board a caravel. As soon as a set of charges could be made upto send to Spain with Columbus, the vessels, with the prisoners, set sail.\\n\\n 　　The master of the caravel, Martin, was profoundly grieved by thesevere treatment to which the great navigator was subjected. He wouldgladly have taken off his irons, but Columbus would not consent. \"I wascommanded by the king and queen,\" he said, \"to submit to whateverBobadilla should order in their name. He has put these chains on me bytheir authority. I will wear them until the king and queen bid me take themoff. I will preserve them afterwards as relics and memorials of the rewardof my services.\" His son, Fernando, who tells this story, says that he did so,that they were always hanging in his cabinet, and that he asked that theymight be buried with him when he died.\\n\\n 　　From this expression of Fernando Columbus, there has arisen, whatMr. Harrisse calls, a \"pure legend,\" that the chains were placed in thecoffin of Columbus. Mr. Harrisse shows good reason for thinking that thiswas not so. \"Although disposed to believe that, in a moment of justindignation, Columbus expressed the wish that these tokens of the ingratitude of which he had been the victim should be buried, with him, Ido not believe that they were ever placed in his coffin.\"It will thus be seen that the third voyage added to the knowledge of thecivilized world the information which Columbus had gained regardingParia and the island of Trinidad. For other purposes of discovery, it wasfruitless.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/245/341.html","bookId":204,"book":{"id":204,"title":"哥伦布传 The Life Of Christopher Columbus","description":"简介： 　　This book contains a life of Columbus, written with the hope ofinteresting all classes of readers. 　　His life has often been written, and it has sometimes been well written. 　　The great book of our countryman, Washington ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/245","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:23 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:23 AM"}}
