{"id":6316,"no":18,"title":"Appendix C","content":"　　It would have been so natural to give the name of Columbus to thenew world which he gave to Castile and Leon, that much wonder has beenexpressed that America was not called Columbia, and many efforts havebeen made to give to the continent this name. The District of Columbiawas so named at a time when American writers of poetry, were determinedthat \"Columbia\" should be the name of the continent. The ship Columbia,from which the great river of the West takes that name, had received thisname under the same circumstances about the same time. The city ofColumbia, which is the capital of South Carolina, was named with thesame wish to do justice to the great navigator.\\n\\n 　　Side by side with the discussion as to the name, and sometimesmaking a part of it, is the question whether Columbus himself was reallythe first discoverer of the mainland. The reader has seen that he first sawthe mainland of South America in the beginning of August, 1498. It wason the fifth, sixth or seventh day, according to Mr. Harrisse\u0027s accuratestudy of the letters. Was this the first discovery by a European of themainland?\\n\\n 　　It is known that Ojeda, with whom the reader is familiar, also saw thiscoast. With him, as passenger on his vessel, was Alberico Vespucci, and atone time it was supposed that Vespucci had made some claim to be thediscoverer of the continent, on account of this voyage. But in truth Ojedahimself says that before he sailed he had seen the map of the Gulf of Pariawhich Columbus had sent home to the sovereigns after he made thatdiscovery. It also seems to be proved that Alberico Vespucci, as he wasthen called, never made for himself any claim to the great discovery.\\n\\n 　　Another question, of a certain interest to people proud of Englishmaritime science, is the question whether the Cabots did not see themainland before Columbus. It is admitted on all hands that they did notmake their first voyage till they knew of Columbus\u0027s first discoveries; butit is supposed that in the first or second voyage of the Cabots, they saw themainland of North America. The dates of the Cabots\u0027 voyages areunfortunately badly entangled. One of them is as early as 1494, but this is generally rejected. It is more probable that the king\u0027s letters patent,authorizing John Cabot and his three sons to go, with five vessels, underthe English flag, for the discovery of islands and countries yet unknown,\"was dated the fifth of March, 1496. Whether, however, they sailed in thatyear or in the next year is a question. The first record of a discovery is inthe account-book of the privy purse of Henry VII, in the words, \"August10th, 1497. To him who discovered the new island, ten pounds.\" This isclearly not a claim on which the discovery of the mainland can be based.\\n\\n 　　A manuscript known as the Cotton Manuscript says that John Cabothad sailed, but had not returned, at the moment when the manuscript waswritten. This period was \"the thirteenth year of Henry VII.\" The thirteenthyear of Henry began on the twenty-second of August, 1497, and ended in1498. On the third of February, 1498, Henry VII granted permission toCabot to take six English ships \"to the lands and islands recently found bythe said Cabot, in the name of the king and by his orders.\" Strictlyspeaking, this would mean that the mainland had then been discovered;but it is impossible to establish the claim of England on these terms.\\n\\n 　　What is, however, more to the point, is a letter from Pasqualigo, aVenetian merchant, who says, writing to Venice, on the twenty-third ofAugust, 1497, that Cabot had discovered the mainland at seven hundredleagues to the west, and had sailed along it for a coast of three hundredleagues. He says the voyage was three months in length. It was made, then,between May and August, 1497. The evidence of this letter seems to showthat the mainland of North America was really first discovered by Cabot.\\n\\n 　　The discussion, however, does not in the least detract from the merit dueto Columbus for the great discovery. Whether he saw an island or whetherhe saw the mainland, was a mere matter of what has been called landfallby the seamen. It is admitted on all hands that he was the leader in allthese enterprises, and that it was on his success in the first voyage that allsuch enterprises followed.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/245/348.html","bookId":204,"book":{"id":204,"title":"哥伦布传 The Life Of Christopher Columbus","description":"简介： 　　This book contains a life of Columbus, written with the hope ofinteresting all classes of readers. 　　His life has often been written, and it has sometimes been well written. 　　The great book of our countryman, Washington ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/245","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:23 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:23 AM"}}
