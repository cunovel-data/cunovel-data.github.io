But as Taryn stormed out through the five-star restaurant, half-aware of curious patrons\u0027 heads turning, that more volatile side of her nature was glad she\u0027d let Cole Hunter know precisely what she\u0027d thought. Sandbox, indeed!\\n\\n He was lucky a glass of wine was all she\u0027d thrown.\\n\\n Outside, the fresh air hit. Stopping at the bottom of the restaurant\u0027s half-dozen stone steps, she glanced around with stinging eyes before the realization struck. Cole had driven her here. To collect her sedan, she\u0027d need to grab a cab back to Hunters.\\n\\n And tomorrow? Cole had as good as said her idea sucked and she was through. Hopefully Guthrie would have something to say about that. But if she went to the senior Hunter about this situation, she\u0027d feel like a tattletale whining to daddy about her bullying big brother. How she longed to circle her hands around Cole\u0027s big tanned neck and squeeze until he turned blue. Lord how she wished she\u0027d never met the man.\\n\\n She noticed a concerned-looking doorman crossing over at the same time a low, smooth voice wrapped around to startle and disarm her from behind.\\n\\n \"Would you kindly tell me what that was about?\"\\n\\n She swung around and glared into Cole Hunter\u0027s flashing green eyes. She hated that her voice was shaky.\\n\\n \"Kindly leave me alone.\"\\n\\n \"You came with me - \"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027ll leave without you.\" She directed her next words to the fidgety doorman. \"Can you organize a cab, please?\"\\n\\n Waving a hand, Cole sent the poor doorman back to his corner. \"I\u0027ll drive you to the station, or home, if you like.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d prefer you didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d prefer that I did.\"\\n\\n \"So you can goad me into doing something else I might regret?\"\\n\\n He stepped closer until his shadow consumed her and his lidded gaze dropped to her lips. \"And just what is it you\u0027re afraid you\u0027ll do?\"\\n\\n When his eyes met hers again, she felt the stakes between them change and swell. Was it her imagination or had he just propositioned her?\\n\\n She ought to be outraged. She should want to slap his face. But the heat racing over her skin, snatching her breath and warming her insides, suddenly felt less like anger and a whole lot more like anticipation.\\n\\n She croaked out, \"I never asked to come here tonight.\"\\n\\n \"No. You were only jumping around like a Christmas puppy, wanting me to see your idea right away.\"\\n\\n \"You said you wanted to see it.\"\\n\\n \"When it was good and cooked.\"\\n\\n She hitched her carryall strap higher on her shoulder. \"Admit it. You never had any intention of giving me a chance.\"\\n\\n \"Whoa. Don\u0027t put this back on me.\"\\n\\n \"No. I should be overjoyed with needing to jump through your hoops after I\u0027ve already landed the job.\"\\n\\n He blinked at that then absently readjusted the platinum watchband on his wrist. \"I\u0027m yet to speak to my father about signing you without consulting me first.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps you should have done that before putting me through that charade.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry for doing you a favor.\"\\n\\n \"Forgive me if I don\u0027t shower you with thanks.\"\\n\\n A cab rolled up the lantern-lit drive while a valet brought Cole\u0027s car around at the same time. Shaking with rage - with hurt and frustration - she made a beeline for the cab with Cole hot on her tail.\\n\\n That doorman came forward to open the passenger door. With one sharp look, Cole sent him packing again. Then, refocusing, he crossed his arms over that stained damp shirt.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry you can\u0027t handle the truth about the premise of your show.\"\\n\\n \"Your version of the truth,\" she pointed out.\\n\\n \"Like it or not, mine\u0027s the only version that counts.\"\\n\\n She crossed her arms, too. \"Has anyone ever suggested that your ego might be a trifle oversize?\"\\n\\n \"My temper, too - particularly, but not excluding, when I\u0027m soaked through and smelling like a barroom floor.\"\\n\\n Her conscience pricked. She looked him up and down. Then, although it pained, she offered up what her aunt might consider polite and fair.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll pay for dry cleaning.\"\\n\\n \"Shirt, trousers and tie.\" He pretended to wring the strip of royal-blue silk. \"You didn\u0027t miss much.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with my pitching arm. I was captain of my school softball team five years running.\"\\n\\n \"Remind me to stay out of your way if you try to swing a bat.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll make sure none of my home runs land in your sandbox.\"\\n\\n Cole looked at her harder, his gaze penetrating - judgmental - and yet she got the impression that a different, less hostile emotion churned just below his surface. Maybe a miniscule touch of grudging respect? She crossed her arms tighter. Too little, too late.\\n\\n Finally he shrugged back both shoulders and tucked in his chin. \"Maybe I was a little over-the-top with the sandbox line.\"\\n\\n She pretended to tug her ear. \"Was that Cole Hunter apologizing?\"\\n\\n \"Merely an observation.\"\\n\\n His brows lifted as if he were waiting for her to return the sentiment. No way would she give another inch.\\n\\n Except...\\n\\n She didn\u0027t need for Cole to walk away from this confrontation thinking he was the better man. She might be right, but she wasn\u0027t stupid.\\n\\n With the cabbie and doorman hanging back, waiting, she eased out that pent-up breath and let her arms unravel.\\n\\n \"Well, maybe,\" she ground out, \"I didn\u0027t need to toss that second drink over your lap.\"\\n\\n The intensity of his gaze gradually lifted and, after another deliberative moment, he tilted his head at his car. \"So you up for a lift back to the station?\"\\n\\n \"Only if I choose the topic of conversation.\"\\n\\n He clutched at his chest. \"You\u0027ll even talk to me?\"\\n\\n \"Not about anything personal. And I\u0027d prefer not to discuss my project with you any more at this time.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure that\u0027s wise.\" He started off then stopped, waiting for her to join him, which - after making him stand there wondering for another five full beats - she did.\\n\\n \"Maybe we could discuss vegetarian cuisine,\" she said as they reached his car.\\n\\n He grunted. \"What about sports?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in charge, remember?\"\\n\\n After she\u0027d slid in, but before he shut the door, she heard him mutter, \"Enjoy it while it lasts.\"\\n\\n Cole drove back to the station listening to Taryn share her secrets on the abundance of ways one could combine pumpkin with pine nuts. Fascinating.\\n\\n But now, as he made his third stop for the evening - at his father\u0027s Pott\u0027s Point mansion - he could admit he\u0027d almost enjoyed the final stint of his evening with this persistent producer. Even as the wine dried on his clothes, he surrendered a smile remembering the poised timbre of her voice and glorious lines of her legs as she\u0027d chatted on.\\n\\n One moment spitting fire, the next a consummate ice queen. He didn\u0027t know which intrigued him more. From the moment he\u0027d laid eyes on her, sitting demurely in his father\u0027s reception lounge, he\u0027d been struck by those lips, her hair, that barely subdued sexuality. After her spectacular meltdown at the restaurant tonight, perverse though it might sound, his attraction for her had only grown.\\n\\n By the time he pulled up beneath his father\u0027s extravagant granite forecourt, Cole was trying to shake the image of Taryn twining her arms around his neck and searching out his kiss - not because he felt guilty necessarily, but because he didn\u0027t need any added aggravation when he visited this place. Guthrie he could handle. His father\u0027s wife, Cole didn\u0027t want to touch.\\n\\n He\u0027d fortified himself and was about to slip out of the car when his cell sounded. Two callers - Dex and Wynn combined. Cole connected and Wynn spoke first.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s Dad holding up?\"\\n\\n Then Dex. \"Do the authorities have any clue who\u0027s behind it all?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll get the guy,\" Cole told them. \"Don\u0027t worry.\"\\n\\n Cole hadn\u0027t been able to get a hold of either brother this morning, or Teagan, for that matter. They had their differences but, beyond and above all else, they were a family. Cole wasn\u0027t certain which brother had organized this conference call, but he was grateful to have the opportunity to fill them in. Dex and Wynn had a right, an obligation, to know about this second attempt on their father\u0027s life, and Guthrie would never tell them. He wouldn\u0027t want any of his children to worry.\\n\\n When Cole finished passing on the incident\u0027s details, Wynn cursed under his breath.\\n\\n \"Cole, what\u0027s the plan? You\u0027ll put some safety measures in place, right? Get a P.I. on board?\"\\n\\n Dex\u0027s deep laugh rumbled down the line. \"As if Cole could stop himself from taking charge.\"\\n\\n Cole huffed. \"I don\u0027t hear either of you offering to fly back and help man the fort.\"\\n\\n \"As a matter of fact - \" Wynn started at the same time Dex said, \"I\u0027ll be right out - \"\\n\\n But Cole cut them both off. \"Stay where you are.\" Wynn couldn\u0027t spare time away from his seat in New York and Dex\u0027s smugness would only drive his older brother nuts. \"I can handle whatever has to be done.\"\\n\\n Dex said, \"Well, if you need anything...\"\\n\\n Flicking a glance toward the house, Cole thought of his stepmother. \"Maybe a leash,\" he muttered.\\n\\n Wynn asked, \"What was that?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing.\" Cole opened the car door. \"I\u0027ll keep you guys in the loop.\" He hung up, and a moment later rang the bell. A woman he\u0027d never seen before fanned open the tall timber door. His expression must have looked as confused as hers. Drab, overweight. Was that a mustache? Shrinking back, he thrust his hands into his pockets.\\n\\n \"Who the devil are you?\"\\n\\n \"I work for the Hunters.\"\\n\\n Cole examined the woman\u0027s garb: a dreary gray old-fashioned uniform. \"What happened to Silvia?\" And her vibrant colors and big friendly smile.\\n\\n The woman shrugged a pair of round shoulders. \"Think the madam said she\u0027d been here too long.\"\\n\\n He grunted. Obviously Silvia had become an annoyance for dear Eloise. He\u0027d seen the calculating look in the younger woman\u0027s eye whenever the Hunters\u0027 much-loved housekeeper had entered a room or dared to have a laugh with Guthrie. Silvia knew this house, the history and its characters inside and out. And like the Hunter boys, Silvia hadn\u0027t approved of the master\u0027s new bride one scrap. Seemed it\u0027d taken Eloise five years to weed their old friend out. So, who was next on the ambitious second Mrs. Hunter\u0027s hit list?\\n\\n The new help wiped a worn hand down her starched apron and asked, \"Who shall I say is calling?\"\\n\\n \"Name\u0027s Cole.\"\\n\\n Dull hazel eyes rounded. \"Mr. Hunter\u0027s eldest?\"\\n\\n As she studied the wine drying on his shirt, he wove around her. \"Where can I find him?\"\\n\\n In the cavernous double-story foyer, another voice joined in. One Cole recognized - and loathed.\\n\\n \"Cole, honey, come on through.\"\\n\\n Decked out in a full-length silk robe the color of ripe strawberries, Eloise beckoned him from beneath the decorative arch that led into the front sitting room. He wondered if she were vain enough to wear all that makeup to bed. So different from his naturally beautiful mother. He wouldn\u0027t start on the difference between poise and class.\\n\\n Dismissing the stirring in the pit of his gut, Cole strode forward. \"I wanted to check in and see how he was doing.\"\\n\\n \"After that terrible business this morning, you mean.\"\\n\\n Cole was already inside and glancing around that sitting room. An empty room. He ran a hand through his hair. He really didn\u0027t have time for hide-and-seek.\\n\\n \"Where is he?\"\\n\\n He spun around. Eloise was standing so close behind, he almost knocked her over. Theatrical, as usual, she emitted a small cry of surprise and swayed, no doubt hoping he\u0027d physically prevent her fall.\\n\\n Cole only stepped well back then asked, \"Is he in the study?\"\\n\\n Filing long graceful fingers back through her disrupted fire-red mane, Eloise pretended to gather herself before heading for the liquor cabinet and holding up a decanter.\\n\\n \"Can I tempt you?\"\\n\\n Cole shuddered. Not on your life.\\n\\n He made a civil excuse. \"I\u0027m tight on time.\"\\n\\n Examining his shirt, she set down the decanter and strolled back over. \"Looks like you\u0027ve already indulged.\"\\n\\n \"My father, Eloise. Where is he?\"\\n\\n \"Your father\u0027s not here. He went out with that new bodyguard of his.\" Looking inward, she frowned. \"Tall. Brooding. Not a friendly type at all.\"\\n\\n Cole grinned. Good. Last thing Guthrie needed was the man meant to protect him succumbing to the mistress\u0027s so-called charm.\\n\\n Retrieving his cell, Cole speed dialed his father. When Guthrie didn\u0027t pick up, Cole left a text message: Call CH ASAP. Then he headed for the door, muttering to Eloise on his way out, \"I won\u0027t keep you.\"\\n\\n But, in her sweeping strawberry robe, she was already scooting around him like her rear end was on fire. When she faced him again, a generous amount of cleavage was showing. Guthrie said she made him happy, and Cole could imagine Eloise doing just about anything to maintain her allowance. Then again, if her older husband was out of the picture, she wouldn\u0027t have to please anyone but herself.\\n\\n \"Before you go, I was hoping you could help me out,\" she was saying. \"Or rather help your little brother.\"\\n\\n About to push on around her, Cole stopped. Dates indicated that Guthrie had married Eloise when she was already pregnant with a boy the whole family had instantly taken into their hearts. Whenever Cole visited, his little brother would talk about becoming a fireman, or, if he wasn\u0027t brave enough for that, one of Santa\u0027s elves. Oh, to be that innocent.\\n\\n Cole asked, \"What\u0027s Tate want?\"\\n\\n Eloise collected an electronic gadget off a nearby sideboard. \"Tate was a horror this evening when he couldn\u0027t get this to work. I had to send him to bed early.\"\\n\\n Cole almost reached for the children\u0027s e-tablet then thought better of it. He wanted to help, but it was wiser to leave.\\n\\n \"Dad can fix it when he gets home.\"\\n\\n She laughed. \"You\u0027re funny. Your father working something like this out.\"\\n\\n Cole scowled. \"He\u0027s an intelligent man.\"\\n\\n \"But, honey, he isn\u0027t a young man.\" Her gaze stroked the expanse of his chest. \"What we need here is someone who\u0027s up-to-date with all the latest.\" She held the gadget out again. \"Tate will be so proud when I tell him big brother Cole took the time to fix this.\"\\n\\n Cole set his jaw. He had no time for Eloise, but he loved Tate. Cole pitied him too for having a mother who placed the importance of painting her nails above anything her son might like to share. Last Christmas, while Tate had ripped open his presents and pored over the bike and Rollerblades Santa had left, Eloise had been a big no-show. When she\u0027d finally scraped herself out of bed around noon, bloodshot eyes told the story of a boozy Christmas Eve. At the time Cole had wondered with whom. His father had looked fit enough to run a marathon, even if he didn\u0027t quite meet his eldest son\u0027s unimpressed gaze.\\n\\n Reminding himself to think only of Tate, Cole took the device and perused the program keys. When, pretending to be curious, Eloise and her claws tipped too close for comfort, Cole lifted his gaze and issued a pointed look. Back off. At the same time, he caught movement near the archway. That woman - the new housekeeper - stood halfway hidden behind the connecting wall. Eloise followed Cole\u0027s line of vision and, taken aback, drew her robe\u0027s opening shut.\\n\\n \"Nancy, you go on to your quarters,\" Eloise said. \"I won\u0027t be needing you anymore tonight.\"\\n\\n With a curt nod, Nancy and her mustache slunk away. If Eloise wanted female help that her husband would find not the least attractive, she\u0027d creamed the top shelf. And Cole didn\u0027t restrict that to looks. Nancy was downright creepy.\\n\\n Attention on the tablet again, Cole fiddled until the screen lit up. After making certain the applications worked, he slid the device back on the sideboard. As he headed out through the foyer, a disappointed Eloise called out in her annoying Southern drawl.\\n\\n \"Your daddy will be back soon. Sure you don\u0027t want to stay awhile?\"\\n\\n Cole opened the door and kept right on walking.\\n\\n Taryn Quinn didn\u0027t like to discuss family. He didn\u0027t particularly like discussing his, either. An out-of-control playboy brother, a big bad stepmom and a father someone wanted dead.\\n\\n As Cole slid back into his car then ignited the turbo engine, he wondered again who was the mastermind behind the bullets this morning. His father was absent tonight. Did that mean this bodyguard he\u0027d hired was on someone\u0027s trail? When this ugly situation was done with and the perpetrator behind prison bars, he\u0027d certainly sleep a lot better. But for now...\\n\\n It was late and he was sticky.\\n\\n Keeping the revs down so as not to wake Tate, he rolled down the drive as his thoughts swung again to Taryn Quinn. She\u0027d denied any romantic connections with her former boss and he believed her. But a woman like Ms. Quinn wasn\u0027t long without an intimate relationship, and after witnessing the fiery side of her nature tonight, it\u0027d be easier if the terms \"Taryn Quinn\" and \"supersexy\" weren\u0027t tangled up together in his head.\\n\\n Accelerating, Cole swung onto the wide tree-lined Pott\u0027s Point road and wondered. Was Taryn \"taken\" or was she \"taking a break\"? Could be she was a new age woman who, too busy for connections, preferred the advantages of a friend with benefits. If he wasn\u0027t certain she\u0027d hurl something heavy at his head, he\u0027d set aside his business-only-with-employees rule and ask.\\n\\n Giving in to a grin, he shot onto the expressway.\\n\\n Hell, he just might ask anyway. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/losing-control-the-hunter-pact-1/page-5.html","bookId":1866,"book":{"id":1866,"title":"Losing Control (The Hunter Pact #1)","description":"Storyline: Losing Control \\n The Hunter Pact #1) \\n \"You\u0027ll be working for me.\"Taking charge comes naturally to workaholic media mogul Cole Hunter.
