{"id":82312,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Taryn usually enjoyed seeing her aunt. But tonight\u0027s visit she could have done without. Not because Vi had done anything disagreeable. They hadn\u0027t had an argument since high school when Taryn had decided she had more important things to do than keep her room halfway clean and suffer regular homework.\n But when Vi had rung and invited herself over for dinner, Taryn wanted to postpone. She wouldn\u0027t make good company. She only wanted to sit around alone and keep rehashing in her mind whether or not she ought to have forgiven Cole for his recent behavior.\n Her stronger self wanted to tell him to take a hike. Who needed to feel like a convenience? She also wanted to give Cole the benefit of the doubt. Maybe when this particularly tough time in his life was over, he would miraculously revert to the charming, at times sensitive man she\u0027d discovered on that island.\n Passion. Desire. A constant need to be close. Until now she\u0027d never been able to comprehend how a woman could get so caught up in those kinds of emotions that she could act in ways that would normally make her retch. She understood better now. It was as if she were infected by him. Her blood, her heart, her mind.\n When she\u0027d confronted him yesterday, she\u0027d held out hope that he would at least make a small effort and drop by her office today. He hadn\u0027t. And tomorrow...? Hell, he had to talk to her sometime. They worked together, for Pete\u0027s sake.\n As Taryn sat with her aunt in her living room, with Vi nattering on about how gorgeous the new kittens were, she realized her aunt had asked a question. Realigning her thoughts, Taryn smiled over.\n \"Sorry. What was that?\"\n \"I was asking if that man at your work had gotten any closer to letting you know whether your show will go ahead.\"\n \"He made his decision yesterday. We start production next week.\"\n Vi jumped in her seat then grabbed her niece to give her a big hug.\n \"I\u0027m so proud of you. Not that I ever had a doubt. That other lot was mad to let you go. But, see, it\u0027s all worked out for the best. You\u0027re with a company who respect who you are and what you can give.\" Reaching down, Vi preened Muffin\u0027s head where the mother cat lay in her big open box by their feet. \"I must say, I was beginning to wonder when your boss would get around to making it official. It\u0027s been over two weeks since you got back from that survey. Was he very difficult while you were away? You\u0027d told me he was a bit of a tyrant at the office.\"\n \"We...came to an understanding.\"\n Vi stopped stroking and tilted her head. \"An understanding, darling?\"\n \"Or I thought we had.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure I understand.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure I understand, either.\"\n Vi\u0027s voice and shoulders dropped. \"He took advantage of you, didn\u0027t he?\"\n As that sick ache spread in her chest, Taryn shut her eyes. She could say that she had no idea what her aunt was talking about. She could tell Vi that she wasn\u0027t in high school anymore. She didn\u0027t have to clean her room if she didn\u0027t want to, and she could sleep with a man - this man - if she chose. But Vi wasn\u0027t attacking her. Her aunt loved her, had always taken care of her and never failed to give the best advice.\n \"He didn\u0027t take advantage of me,\" Taryn finally said. \"I wanted it to happen. He\u0027s an extremely charismatic man.\"\n Vi\u0027s brows sloped as if she\u0027d figured that out.\n \"From the moment we met,\" Taryn went on, \"there\u0027s been a thing between us. You know. A connection.\"\n \"An attraction.\"\n \"It would have happened eventually whether we went away together or not.\"\n \"So you don\u0027t regret it?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t think I would.\"\n Taryn explained about the attempt on Guthrie Hunter\u0027s life. She told Vi how much Cole seemed to have appreciated her support when they\u0027d called into the Hunter home that night. She also told her about all the trouble at Hunters in L.A. and of Cole\u0027s concerns regarding that big sporting contract.\n While she talked on, Vi listened, nodding at certain points, scowling when it was appropriate. Taryn ended by saying that over the past week, Cole\u0027s affections and attention toward her had cooled. Actually, other than that token brush of his lips over her cheek yesterday before leaving her alone in that empty office, his dealings with her verged on chilly.\n \"But when he explained what was behind his being so distant, I understood. Or I tried to.\" When her aunt remained quiet, Taryn asked, \"Don\u0027t you have any advice?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure you want to hear it.\"\n \"Other than suggesting I should lower my hem or not leave assignments till the last minute, I can\u0027t remember a time I didn\u0027t take your advice.\"\n Vi\u0027s attention dropped again to Muffin and her week-old litter of three.\n \"You\u0027d spoken about this cat for months,\" she said. \"How you\u0027d call to her, lay food trails for her, how you\u0027d even tried to pounce on her a couple of times. You figured that once you got her inside, she\u0027d want to stay.\"\n Taryn wasn\u0027t certain where this was headed. \"She looks happy enough now she\u0027s here.\"\n \"Do you think she would have been if you\u0027d caught her and locked her up in this house?\"\n Taryn blinked. \"I was trying to help.\"\n \"You wanted to give her a home here with you. But if you\u0027d forced her, chances are she\u0027d only want to escape.\"\n \"You\u0027re saying I should let Cole do what he wants - let him go - and maybe, one day, he\u0027ll come back to me.\" Taryn shrank back. \"I can\u0027t do that.\"\n \"You can\u0027t force someone to act a certain way, either.\"\n \"Like be halfway decent?\"\n Why should Cole have it all his way? By nature, she was a reserved person who tolerated much, but she did not like to be used - taken for granted - and Vi\u0027s advice seemed to insinuate that she do and accept just that.\n Vi stood. \"I\u0027ll get dinner on. I brought blueberry pastries for a treat afterward.\"\n Vi was heading toward the kitchen when Taryn said, \"I remember when I was very young, you dated a man. He was nice from what I recall. You were happy. But one night I heard a disagreement and we never saw him again.\"\n Vi nodded as if she remembered it well. \"That was a long time ago.\"\n \"I\u0027d hoped that you two would get married,\" Taryn confessed.\n \"I\u0027d hoped for that, too. Marty was a wonderful man, married before with three children all around your age.\"\n \"What went wrong, Vi? What was the argument about?\"\n \"Marty was a family man. He would\u0027ve liked nothing more than to have made his family with us.\"\n \"And he loved you.\"\n \"I believe he did. I most certainly loved him.\"\n Taryn held her swooping stomach. \"It wasn\u0027t because of me, was it? The reason you broke up.\"\n Vi laughed and crossed back over. \"You were an angel. Still are. Marty said often what a good girl you were. That you and I were lucky to have each other. It tore him up that he could only see his own children every other weekend.\"\n \"So his wife hadn\u0027t passed away.\"\n \"They were divorced. He said it was the hardest thing in the world to pack his bags and know that from that moment on his family would be forever fractured. We\u0027d been seeing each other for six months when he asked his children if they\u0027d like to meet a special lady and her niece. They\u0027d innocently told their mother. Suddenly she wanted him back.\"\n \"So no one else could have him.\"\n \"He didn\u0027t contact me for a few days after that. Then, that night you remember, he tried to explain how cornered he felt. I didn\u0027t understand. Or didn\u0027t want to. If he loved me, he wouldn\u0027t consider going back to live with another woman, even the mother of his children.\" Vi\u0027s eyes began to glisten. \"I couldn\u0027t bear the thought of his sleeping in the same bed with her, of her kissing him good-night when I was the one who loved him, not her.\"\n Feeling sick for her all these years later, Taryn reached up to hold her aunt\u0027s hands. \"But you said you\u0027d wait for him, right?\"\n \"I told him that if he was even considering that, he could go now. Or he could do the decent thing and tell me, then and there, that he was staying where he was, with us.\" She sighed. \"He left. I was so upset. As far as I could see, he mustn\u0027t have loved me. Or, at least, not enough.\"\n \"Maybe you did the right thing.\"\n Vi\u0027s resigned look returned. \"Three months later, his ex kicked him out again. I saw his photo in the back pages of a paper three years later. He\u0027d married a woman with a big bright smile. I wondered if they\u0027d be happy together. I wondered if she loved him as much as I still did.\"\n Taryn slowly got to her feet. \"I never knew.\"\n Never had any idea. Vi was a person who rolled up her sleeves and got on with things. But she was also a woman, with emotions, passions, like everyone else.\n When her aunt inhaled deeply, Taryn knew she was willing back tears.\n \"So, you see,\" Vi said, \"you can\u0027t force someone to stay. You have to let them make up their own mind. And there are no rules to say that decisions that might seem easy for one aren\u0027t incredibly difficult for another. When I look back now, if I\u0027d been him, I would have gone back to her, too.\"\n Taryn thought about that, but it was obvious. \"Because of the children.\"\n Muffin let out a loud meow and Vi brought herself back. \"I think she\u0027s telling us dinner is long overdue.\"\n Wanting to cry for her, Taryn wrapped her arms around her aunt. \"I\u0027m so glad you came today. So thankful you\u0027ve always been there for me.\"\n Vi hugged her back, stroked her hair. \"I wouldn\u0027t have had it any other way.\"\n Cole glanced at the time on his laptop screen then rubbed a hand over his stinging eyes. He was beat. Time to knock off. Time he ate. But he still had so much to do trying to figure out how to shuffle the figures in L.A. so Hunter Productions could enter the next season as strongly as possible.\n What he\u0027d much rather do is drop by Taryn\u0027s place and take her out to dinner. Only, like the rest of the East Coast, given the time, she would already have eaten. And, besides, he wasn\u0027t good for her right now. Or was that she wasn\u0027t good for him? Either way, a man could only have one mistress, and his was Hunter Enterprises. He couldn\u0027t let the company - his family and mother\u0027s memory - down again. Not for a woman. Even a woman like Taryn.\n His cell phone buzzed. Cole read the ID. A rush of heat filled his neck, his head, his chest. Two deep breaths and he connected. His brother\u0027s smooth baritone echoed down the line.\n \"Hope I didn\u0027t wake you,\" Dex said.\n \"I don\u0027t get the luxury of much sleep these days.\"\n \"In a happy mood as usual, I see.\"\n Cole bit down. What must it be like to go through life pretending you had nothing more to worry about than which starlet you were going to sleep with next?\n He ground out, \"What do you want?\"\n \"To brighten your day. The revenue figures are in on our latest release. After a huge opening weekend, we\u0027re solid, sitting well on top of the black.\"\n Cole let the line hang.\n \"Cole, you there?\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you even slightly pleased?\"\n \"I\u0027m waiting.\"\n \"What for?\"\n \"The bad news.\"\n Dex laughed, a deep and carefree sound. He\u0027d been the same since they were kids. Dex was the charmer, who managed to wiggle in and out of trouble without getting so much as a scratch, while Cole was busy learning the business, making sure someone of integrity would one day take over what their grandfather and father had worked so hard to build. Dex didn\u0027t seem to worry too much about any of that.\n Eyeing Brandon and Jeremy Judge\u0027s latest report lying read twice on his desk, Cole asked, \"Want the latest on Dad?\"\n \"What\u0027s happening there? Tate all right now?\"\n \"He\u0027s fine.\"\n Cole gave a rundown on security measures and the fact Brandon was working hard with Judge to uncover new leads.\n Dex got back to Tate. \"Well, if the little guy wants to come over for a visit...\"\n \"That\u0027s funny. Take a five-year-old away from kidnapping troubles to put him with a man who is the target of a blackmail campaign.\"\n \"I told you not to worry about that.\" Dex grunted. \"I must have been raving mad letting that slip in the first place.\"\n \"If I don\u0027t worry, who will?\"\n Dex pushed out a breath. \"All I\u0027m saying is that Tate is welcome anytime.\"\n \"Who have you got lined up to babysit? Some Hollywood starlet you\u0027re screwing?\"\n The line went deathly quiet. \"Be careful, bro. You might find reward in your near monklike lifestyle, the fact you get off on telling everyone how hard you work and how no one appreciates what you do, but I intend to go on enjoying what a man is meant to enjoy.\"\n \"That would be an endless string of empty affairs.\"\n \"You\u0027re a sanctimonious son of a - \"\n The conversation went downhill from there.\n Cole was still fuming when he left the building an hour later. How could two brothers be so different? Birth order? A swap at the hospital the day Dex was born? Although, Cole could admit, Dex had got the tail end of his latest foul mood. At least that new release was doing well. There was still the problem of Tate. Hopefully his little brother wouldn\u0027t be involved in any future incidents, but should Tate happen to get hurt in any way because of this murder attempt mess, Cole would feel directly responsible. He didn\u0027t want Tate to get mixed up in Dex\u0027s blackmail business, if it came to anything. Then again, what could be worse than living with Eloise as a mother? The answer was the possibility of being shoved in a van never to be seen or heard from again.\n Cole was driving on autopilot when he noticed the sign announcing the arterial route to Taryn\u0027s neighborhood. She might think he hadn\u0027t thought much about her lately. Truth was he\u0027d thought about her a great deal. Way too much. Another reason he wasn\u0027t getting much sleep.\n This past week he\u0027d had to put up a barrier between them. Not that he\u0027d wanted to, but, frankly, she\u0027d been interfering with his responsibilities. And, to be fair, he\u0027d let himself get sidetracked. Taryn\u0027s company was always preferable to flogging himself with budget and technical reports, proposals and financial crises. But if he didn\u0027t cover all the bases, who would? Admittedly, Roman Lyons was proving to be a big ongoing help. His father, however, barely came into the office anymore, which, Cole supposed, meant less likelihood of decisions needing to be reversed.\n That brought him back to Taryn.\n He couldn\u0027t risk distractions. While she was employed by Hunter Broadcasting, he would know little relief. He\u0027d okayed her show out of obligation more than anything. A sense of loyalty, or maybe expectation. And while that may be understandable, given the nature of the time they\u0027d spent together, he wasn\u0027t looking forward to the anticipated hit to the company. Hell, he\u0027d just chastised Dex for not thinking with his head. Recently, had he been any better?\n Setting his jaw, Cole stepped on the gas and drove past that turnoff.\n Grandpa Hunter used to say, There\u0027s no better time for change than the present.\n No smarter time than now to move on. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/losing-control-the-hunter-pact-1/page-17.html","bookId":1866,"book":{"id":1866,"title":"Losing Control (The Hunter Pact #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Losing Control \n The Hunter Pact #1) \n \"You\u0027ll be working for me.\"Taking charge comes naturally to workaholic media mogul Cole Hunter.
