{"id":82298,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"Guthrie would\u0027ve mentioned we\u0027ll be working together.\"\\n\\n When his statement received no reply, Cole wasn\u0027t entirely surprised. Taryn Quinn was attractive and charming. She was also aloof. Mysterious. As they walked together down the eastern wing of the Hunter Broadcasting building, Cole admitted he was intrigued, as his father knew he would be.\\n\\n Rod Walker\u0027s call was an excuse Guthrie had pounced upon to bring his son and new producer together, despite the fact that Cole was, one, hard-pressed for time and, two, obviously opposed to investing in Ms. Quinn\u0027s proposal. Money was too darn tight and Guthrie knew it. But when she\u0027d seemed so indifferent toward him - sitting there demurely with those shapely legs crossed, engrossed in that glossy magazine - blast it, he\u0027d been intrigued all the more. Against better judgment, he\u0027d decided to escort Taryn to her office and see if he couldn\u0027t prick that haughty shell.\\n\\n So far, no good.\\n\\n Passing an interested group of employees, and still awaiting a response, Cole risked a glance. Taryn was staring at him as if he\u0027d announced science had proven that the moon was indeed made of green cheese. Perhaps she was hard of hearing.\\n\\n He spoke louder. \"I said as long as you\u0027re with Hunter Broadcasting, you\u0027ll be working under me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\" Shrugging back slender shoulders draped in an elegant black jacket, she looked dead ahead. \"But you\u0027re wrong.\"\\n\\n Cole\u0027s step faltered. Not deaf. Nor had she misunderstood. He threw a suspect glance around. Was there a hidden camera or was she purposely ruffling his feathers?\\n\\n \"You must be aware of my position here - CEO as well as Executive Producer - and that\u0027s for every show that comes out of Hunters. I give the nod on budgets, sponsor deals - \" his gaze sharpened on her perfect profile \" - as well as the overall vision of any given project.\"\\n\\n The peaks of her dark blond brows arched as she met his gaze square on. \"Guthrie and I have discussed all that. I\u0027ll be working directly beneath him.\"\\n\\n Cole didn\u0027t hide his smirk. He disliked cruelty in any form but he might enjoy setting sassy Ms. Quinn back, flat on her pretty behind. Whatever Guthrie had said, he hadn\u0027t worked in that kind of hands-on capacity for years.\\n\\n Or maybe he should look at this collusion from a different angle. What had Taryn Quinn said or done to get this close to his father? And exactly how close was that?\\n\\n Suddenly a dozen other questions sprang to mind, like where did Taryn hail from? What was her personal background? Did she have a criminal record? Did she know anything about those murder attempts?\\n\\n Up ahead, London-born Head of Comedy, Roman Lyons, was strolling out of his office, whistling that same Cockney tune that grated on Cole\u0027s nerves like nails down a chalkboard. When Roman first joined Hunters, the two had a disagreement over the direction of a series. Cole had terminated his contract. Guthrie, however, had persuaded Cole to give Lyons another chance. After two years, Cole would concede that Roman did a good job. He\u0027d even stepped in to oversee things a few times when Cole had been called away. But they\u0027d never be best buds.\\n\\n Now as he and Taryn approached, Lyons issued a casual salute to Cole, but his focus was fixed on Taryn. From the awareness sparkling in Lyons\u0027s dark hooded gaze, anyone might think that he knew her.\\n\\n \"This must be the new girl. Taryn, is it?\" Lyons offered a knowing wink as well as his hand. \"Word gets around.\"\\n\\n Cole\u0027s jaw jutted. Word hadn\u0027t gotten around to him.\\n\\n \"Thanks for the welcome,\" Taryn said as her hand dropped away. \"And you are?\"\\n\\n \"Name\u0027s Roman Lyons.\"\\n\\n \"Looks like we\u0027ll be neighbors, Mr. Lyons. I drew the office next to yours.\"\\n\\n \"I was about to grab a cuppa,\" Lyons went on. \"Can I tempt you?\"\\n\\n Taryn\u0027s face lit. \"I\u0027d kill for coffee.\"\\n\\n \"Let me guess,\" Lyons said. \"White, one sugar.\"\\n\\n Cole growled. Oh, give me a break.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll leave you two to get acquainted.\" He started off. \"I have work to do.\"\\n\\n \"With Liam Finlay? I saw him headed toward your office a minute ago.\" Roman straightened the knot of his tie as if he were loosening a noose. \"He didn\u0027t look happy, if you don\u0027t mind me saying.\"\\n\\n Cole bit back a curse. Liam Finlay wasn\u0027t a man to keep waiting, particularly today. Finlay was CEO for Australia\u0027s most popular football league. Hunter Broadcasting had held the cable broadcast rights to the majority of that league\u0027s games until five years ago, when Guthrie and Finlay had suffered a major falling-out. This year those coveted rights were back up for grabs. Cole had had a hard time getting Finlay to even talk. At this juncture, he couldn\u0027t afford any perceived insults, like letting his guest sit around twiddling his thumbs.\\n\\n In a near-sincere tone, Taryn said, \"Thanks for taking the time, Mr. Hunter. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll be fine from here.\"\\n\\n A pulse point in Cole\u0027s temple began to throb. He had to get to that meeting. But, dammit, he wasn\u0027t finished with Ms. Quinn just yet.\\n\\n As Roman sauntered off, Taryn entered her new office, which was decked out with teak furniture and the latest tech equipment, including visual and audio state of the art. But she moved directly to the floor-to-ceiling windows. He imagined he heard her sigh as she drank in the billion-dollar harbor view, complete with iconic coat-hanger bridge and multistory-high Opera House shells.\\n\\n Letting his gaze rake over the silken fall of her hair and the tantalizing curves concealed beneath that smart blue skirt, Cole leaned a shoulder against the doorjamb.\\n\\n \"You have qualifications other than in television production, Ms. Quinn?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve worked in TV since attaining my Arts Business degree.\"\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027d have experience - held positions - in other areas within the industry, correct?\"\\n\\n \"I started out as a junior production assistant and worked up through the ranks.\"\\n\\n \"And my father was - \" he scanned her skirt again \" - suitably impressed by your credentials?\"\\n\\n When she angled around, her smile was lazy, assured. \"As a matter of fact, Guthrie was more than impressed.\"\\n\\n \"I make a point of having all my employees\u0027 backgrounds screened, management particularly.\"\\n\\n \"Heavens, you must have skeletons jumping out of closets all over the place.\"\\n\\n His mouth hooked up at one side. Cute.\\n\\n He crossed his arms. \"Any skeletons in your closet, Ms. Quinn?\"\\n\\n \"We all have secrets, although they\u0027re rarely of interest to anyone else.\"\\n\\n \"I have a feeling I\u0027d be interested in yours.\"\\n\\n Those big blue eyes narrowed then she strolled up to him, the deliberate sway in her walk meant to challenge. When she was close enough for the scent of her perfume to tease his nostrils, she stopped and set her hands on her hips. Cole exhaled. Poor Ms. Quinn. Didn\u0027t she know he ate novices like her for breakfast?\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve taken up enough of your time,\" she told him. \"Don\u0027t keep your guest waiting. I\u0027m sure your father will be along soon.\"\\n\\n He grinned. Damn, he could play with her all day, if only he had the time - which he didn\u0027t. He pushed off the jamb.\\n\\n \"My father might have employed you, but I\u0027m the one in charge of the books, and if your show doesn\u0027t perform, production stops. That is, if I allow it to get off the ground in the first place.\"\\n\\n A shadow darkened her eyes. \"My show will not only launch, it will be a new season smash. We\u0027re bringing in A-list guests.\"\\n\\n \"Been done.\"\\n\\n \"Choosing destinations that are considered rough as well as luxurious.\"\\n\\n \"Old.\"\\n\\n \"The host I have in mind is the most popular in the country. Voted Australia\u0027s most eligible with a string of hits under his belt.\"\\n\\n Cole\u0027s gaze flicked to her naturally bee-stung lips. \"That\u0027s the best you can offer?\"\\n\\n He imagined her quiver, as if a bolt of red-tipped annoyance had zapped straight up her spine. \"I have a signed copy of the approved proposal as well as a contract setting my salary.\"\\n\\n \"A contract which will be paid out unless your pilot is fresher than tomorrow\u0027s headline news.\"\\n\\n An emotion akin to hatred flashed in her eyes. \"Perhaps I should put a call through to my lawyer.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps you should.\"\\n\\n Any space separating them seemed to shrink while the awareness simmering in that steamy void began to crackle and smoke. Taryn Quinn whipped up his baser instincts to a point where he could forget she was an employee. In fact, right now he was evaluating her through the crosshairs of a vastly different lens. She pretended to be cool, in control. Would she be so restrained in the bedroom? Instinct said she\u0027d set the sheets on fire.\\n\\n She was saying, \"And if I were to come up with something you hadn\u0027t seen before?\"\\n\\n He gifted her with a slow smile. \"Then, Ms. Quinn, I\u0027d be happy to visit it.\"\\n\\n He asked that she get the original and revised proposal to him as soon as she had something that would knock his socks off. But as Cole made his way down the corridor toward his office and Liam Finlay, he berated himself. Normally in these kinds of situations he wasn\u0027t distracted by sex appeal; that was playboy Dex\u0027s vice. But the challenging blue depths of Taryn Quinn\u0027s eyes, the impudent tilt of her slightly upturned nose, the fact he knew in his gut she was hiding something...\\n\\n Thinking of those flaming sheets, Cole admitted, he was looking forward to prying open her closets.\\n\\n \"What do you think of the Commander?\"\\n\\n Familiarizing herself with her office LCD TV, Taryn glanced up. Roman Lyons had returned with two steaming cups in tow. Remote control in one hand, she accepted the coffee he offered while she grinned at Roman\u0027s nickname for Cole.\\n\\n \"Cole obviously likes to run a tight ship,\" she conceded.\\n\\n \"As much as he likes introducing newcomers to his infamous plank.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds as if you speak from experience.\"\\n\\n \"Cole has his fans - \" bringing the cup to his mouth, Roman arched a brow \" - as well as his foes.\"\\n\\n \"Which side do you fall on?\"\\n\\n \"On the \u0027keeping my job\u0027 side. To survive in this industry, you need to roll with the punches. But you\u0027ve been around. You\u0027d know all that.\" He nodded at the static on the screen and gestured at the control. \"This office was vacant for a while. I\u0027ll tweak the settings.\"\\n\\n She handed over the control and watched as he concentrated to tune in channels, including internal feeds. Roman Lyons was good-looking in a saucy Hugh Grant kind of way. Certainly friendly, helpful and with a sense of humor, too. No wonder he rubbed \"Trouble\" the wrong way.\\n\\n \"Tell me how you came to be at Hunters,\" Roman said, as his thumb danced over the remote\u0027s keys.\\n\\n \"I had a long stint at the last network I worked for.\" She mentioned the name and recited a few of their shows. \"Last year, one of the executive producers asked for ideas for new series. He was interested in a couple of mine but ultimately passed. In the meantime another network approached me.\"\\n\\n \"The industry does like to poach.\"\\n\\n \"I declined their offer of an interview. I was happy where I was. But management heard about the communication and when information about a new show was leaked, they questioned my loyalty.\" Remembering the scene when that EP had dressed her down, she shuddered and blew out a breath. Her direct boss was livid at his protegee\u0027s treatment, but he had a family to feed. She\u0027d insisted he not get involved. \"That afternoon, my desk was packed up and I was out on the curb.\"\\n\\n Roman collected a second control off the stand. \"TV is not for the faint of heart.\"\\n\\n \"I could have filed a suit for unfair dismissal. But I decided to rise above it, take the payout and move on.\"\\n\\n \"What happened to the network that wanted to poach you?\"\\n\\n \"That position was already filled. But I knew my ideas would fly somewhere else. After wallowing for a couple of weeks, I plucked up the nerve to call here and speak to Guthrie directly.\"\\n\\n As she took a sip from her cup, Roman handed back the first control. \"Good for you.\"\\n\\n \"Frankly, I almost fell off my chair when he asked me to come in for an interview. I was even more blown away when he gave my show the green light straightaway.\" Thoughtful, she ran a thumb over the remote\u0027s keys. \"I was on such a high, so convinced I\u0027d do a great job, but after meeting Cole, I have to wonder if that green light is fast turning red.\" She set the remote down on the corner of her desk. \"Roman, can you set me straight on something? Because I\u0027m a little confused. Which Hunter is in charge here? I know control of the branches of the company was split a few years ago between the three sons, but I assumed Guthrie still pulled all the strings.\"\\n\\n Beneath a flop of dark sandy hair, Roman\u0027s high brow creased. Then he held up a cautionary hand and, although they\u0027d been speaking quietly, he crossed to close the door.\\n\\n \"Word is that after his wife\u0027s death,\" Roman said, moving back, \"Guthrie lost all heart. No one knows for sure, but if you put it to a vote, most will say he gave up all control.\"\\n\\n \"You mean Guthrie has no say? What\u0027s he doing then, hiring me?\"\\n\\n \"Guthrie was down for a while but when he married again, he got his wind back. Staff here were chuffed. It was as if he\u0027d got another chance at life and he didn\u0027t intend to waste a minute. The wedding was big, expensive - \" he hiked a brow \" - and fast.\"\\n\\n Of course Taryn remembered the publicity surrounding that big day, a huge celebrity bash with a bride who had looked thirty years the groom\u0027s junior - which was nobody\u0027s business but their own.\\n\\n \"At my interview, Guthrie seemed genuinely excited and behind my show,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Then he must believe in it.\"\\n\\n \"While his son\u0027s hand is twitching on the guillotine rope. He told me unless I can come up with an extraordinary twist, I\u0027m out.\"\\n\\n Roman thought for a long moment before giving a mischievous smile. He purposefully set down his empty cup. \"Right-o. We need sketch pads. Markers. A plan.\"\\n\\n She blinked and then brightened. \"As in you and me \u0027we\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Two heads, and all that. What say we come up with a twist that hits Cole right where he bloody well lives? He\u0027ll either love it or...\"\\n\\n \"Or he\u0027ll love it.\" He had to. Taryn moved to scoop her laptop out from its bag. \"Let\u0027s get started.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/losing-control-the-hunter-pact-1/page-2.html","bookId":1866,"book":{"id":1866,"title":"Losing Control (The Hunter Pact #1)","description":"Storyline: Losing Control \\n The Hunter Pact #1) \\n \"You\u0027ll be working for me.\"Taking charge comes naturally to workaholic media mogul Cole Hunter.
