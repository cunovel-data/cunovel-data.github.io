{"id":19170,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. A ROOM IN CENTRE STREET.","content":"In a room on the third floor of a miserable tenement house in Centre street two men were sitting. Each had a forbidding exterior, and neither was in any danger of being mistaken for a peaceful, law-abiding citizen. One, attired in a red shirt and pants, was leaning back in his chair, smoking a clay pipe. His hair was dark and his beard nearly a week old. Over his left eye was a scar, the reminder of a wound received in one of the numerous affrays in which he had been engaged. This was Jack Morgan, already referred to as the guardian of the boy Julius. He was certainly a disreputable-looking ruffian, and his character did not belie his looks. The other man was taller, better dressed, and somewhat more respectable in appearance. But, like Jack, he, too, was a social outlaw, and the more dangerous that he could more easily assume an air of respectability, and pass muster, if he chose, as an honest man. \"Well, Marlowe,\" said Jack Morgan to the latter, who had just entered, \"how\u0027s business?\" \"Not very good,\" said Marlowe, shaking his head. \"I haven\u0027t been so hard up for a long time. You haven\u0027t lost much by being shut up.\" \"I\u0027ve had my board and lodging free,\" said Morgan; \"but I\u0027d rather look out for myself. I don\u0027t like free hotels.\" Marlowe smiled. \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re right, Jack. I never tried it but once, and then I didn\u0027t like it any better than you.\" \"You\u0027re a sharp one. You always cover your tracks.\" \"The cops don\u0027t often get hold of me,\" said Marlowe, with pride. \"You remember that big bond robbery a year ago?\" \"Yes. You wasn\u0027t in that?\" \"Yes, I was.\" \"The rest of the fellows got trapped.\" \"That\u0027s so; but I heard in time and got off.\" \"Did you make anything out of it?\" \"I made sure of a thousand-dollar bond.\" \"Did you put it off?\" \"Yes; I sold it for half price.\" \"Where is the money?\" \"It lasted me a month,\" said Marlowe, coolly. \"I lived then, you can bet. But I haven\u0027t done much since. Do you see that?\" He took from his vest pocket a dollar greenback. \"What of it?\" \"It\u0027s my last dollar.\" \"Then you\u0027ve got to do something.\" \"Yes.\" \"Haven\u0027t you thought of anything?\" \"I\u0027ve got a plan that may work.\" Here Julius entered, and his entrance produced a brief interruption. \"What luck, Julius?\" asked Morgan. \"Nothing much. I got a bundle to carry for a quarter.\" \"Have you got the money?\" \"There\u0027s ten cents. I bought my supper with the rest.\" \"Give it to me.\" Jack Morgan took the ten cents and thrust it into his pocket. \"You ain\u0027t smart, Julius,\" he said. \"You ought to have brought more than that.\" \"Buy me a blacking-box and I will,\" said Julius. \"I\u0027ll see about it. But, Marlowe, you were just goin\u0027 to tell me of your plan.\" \"Shall I tell before him?\" asked Marlowe, indicating the boy. \"Drive ahead. He\u0027s one of us.\" \"There\u0027s a house on Madison avenue that I\u0027ve heard about. It belongs to a man that\u0027s gone to Europe.\" \"Then there isn\u0027t much left in it worth taking.\" \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong. I\u0027ve found out that he has left all his plate locked up in a safe on the second floor and some bonds, too, it\u0027s most likely.\" \"Has he got much?\" \"So I hear.\" \"Who told you?\" \"A man that was in his service. He was discharged for drunkenness, and he owes this Mr. Talbot a grudge.\" \"Is he a thief himself?\" \"No, but he is willing to help us, out of revenge.\" \"Then you can depend on his information.\" \"Yes; there is no doubt of it.\" \"Is the house empty?\" \"No; there\u0027s a family in charge.\" \"That\u0027s bad.\" \"Not so bad; it\u0027s a widow, with two children—one a little boy of eight or thereabouts, the other sixteen.\" \"Do you know anything about them?\" \"The oldest boy is a street peddler. He keeps a necktie stand below the Astor House.\" Hitherto Julius had not taken much interest in the conversation. That his disreputable guardian should be planning a burglary did not strike him with surprise. It seemed only a matter of course. But the last remark of Marlowe put a different face upon the matter. The description was so exact that he felt almost certain the boy spoken of must be his new friend, to whom he had been indebted for the best dinner he had eaten for many a day. He began to listen now, but not too obtrusively, as that might awaken suspicion. \"A boy of sixteen may give trouble,\" said Jack Morgan. \"He is easily disposed of,\" said Marlowe, indifferently. \"I wish it were only the woman and little boy we had to deal with.\" \"We can easily secure the boy\u0027s absence for that night.\" \"How?\" \"I can\u0027t tell yet, but there\u0027s plenty of ways. He might be arrested on a false charge and kept over night in the station-house. Or there\u0027s other ways. But I can\u0027t tell till I know more about him. A letter might be sent him, asking him to go over to Brooklyn.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t do. His mother would get somebody else in his place.\" \"We must find out all about him. How\u0027s that boy of yours? Is he sharp?\" \"He ought to be. He\u0027s knocked about for himself long enough.\" \"We can try him. Come here, my son.\" Julius rose from his seat and walked up to the pair. \"Hark you, my lad, can you do as you\u0027re told?\" Julius nodded. \"We\u0027ve got something for you to do. It\u0027ll lead to money—do you hear?\" \"I hear,\" said Julius. \"Have you heard what we were talking about?\" \"I heard, but I didn\u0027t mind.\" \"Then I want you to hear, and mind, too, now. Have you ever seen a necktie stand between Dey and Cortlandt streets?\" \"Yes.\" \"There\u0027s a boy keeps it.\" \"I\u0027ve seed him.\" \"So far so good, then. Do you know anything about him?\" Julius shook his head. \"Then I want you to find out all you can about him. Find out if he\u0027s got any friends in Brooklyn, or just outside of the city. I\u0027ll tell you what I know about him, and then you must learn as much more as possible. Do you know his name?\" \"No.\" \"It is Paul Hoffman. He and his mother live in a house that they take care of on Madison avenue. We want to break into that house some night next week and carry off some plate and bonds that are in the safe. If we make the haul we\u0027ll do well by you.\" \"I understand,\" said Julius, nodding intelligently. \"What we want,\" pursued Marlowe, \"is to have the boy sleep out of the house the night we make the attempt. That will leave the coast clear. If the woman wakes up and discovers us, we\u0027ll threaten to kill her if she makes any fuss. Do you hear?\" Julius nodded again. \"Do you think you can do what we want?\" \"Yes.\" \"That\u0027s well. We\u0027ll wait for the boy\u0027s report before we lay our plans, Jack. Now that\u0027s settled, we\u0027ll send out for some whisky and drink success to the job.\" \"Then you must find the money, Marlowe, for I\u0027m dead broke.\" \"Here, boy, take this,\" said Marlowe, handing Julius the bill he had recently displayed, \"and bring back a pint of whisky.\" \"All right,\" said Julius. \"And mind you bring back the change, or I must go without breakfast to-morrow morning.\" \"I\u0027ll remember,\" said Julius. When he had gone out, Marlowe said: \"Where did you pick up that boy, Jack? He isn\u0027t your son, is he?\" \"No; I have no son. I picked him up one day when he was a little chap. He didn\u0027t seem to belong to nobody; so I took him home, and he\u0027s been with me ever since.\" \"Where does he go when you are shut up, Jack? That\u0027s a good part of the time, you know.\" \"Into the streets. He picks up a living there somehow. I don\u0027t ask how.\" \"And he always comes back to you when you get out again?\" \"Yes.\" \"Loves you like a father, eh?\" said Marlowe, laughing. \"He\u0027s used to me,\" said Jack, indifferently. Not being sentimental, he never troubled himself to expect affection from his young ward, and would not have felt very deeply afflicted if he had deserted him. Still, he, too, had got used to the society of Julius, who was the only living thing that clung to him, and probably would have felt a degree of regret at his loss. There are few, however callous, who do not feel some satisfaction in companionship. Marlowe laughed. \"What are you laughing at?\" said Jack. \"I was thinking, Jack, that you wasn\u0027t exactly the right sort to train up a boy in the way he should go, and all that. If he takes pattern by you, it\u0027s easy to tell where he\u0027ll fetch up.\" \"He ain\u0027t a bad sort,\" said Jack. \"Has he ever been over to the island?\" \"No.\" \"Then he hasn\u0027t followed your teaching, that\u0027s all I can say.\" \"Never mind about the boy,\" said Jack, who had grown weary of the subject. \"He can take care of himself.\" Here Julius reappeared with the whisky. Both men brightened up at the sight of their favorite beverage. \"Have you got a pack of cards?\" asked Marlowe. \"Are there any cards?\" asked Jack, appealing to Julius. The boy found some hidden away in the cupboard, and the men taking them were soon intent upon a game of poker. Julius looked on for a time, for he, too, knew something of the game; but after a time he became drowsy, and threw himself upon a pallet in the corner, which he shared with his guardian. He didn\u0027t sleep immediately, however, for now that his attention was drawn away from the game, he began to consider how he should act in the matter which had been confided to him. Should he prove true to his guardian and treacherous to Paul, or should he repay the latter for the kindness he had received at his hands? It was a difficult question. While he was pondering it his eyes closed and he fell asleep. The men continued to play for about two hours, for penny stakes. The game had no interest for them unless something was staked upon it, and the winner pocketed his winnings with as much satisfaction as if it had been a thousand times as large.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82870.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
