{"id":19183,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. A TIMELY RESCUE.","content":"Julius was filled with a terrible fear, when in the man who stood over him menacingly he recognized Tom Marlowe. He knew the man\u0027s brutal disposition, and that he was very much incensed against him. He looked wildly around him for help, but he could see no one. The sailor had hidden behind a large tree, and was not visible. \"You\u0027re looking for help, are you?\" sneered Marlowe. \"Look all you want to. You\u0027re in my power. Now tell me, you treacherous young dog, why shouldn\u0027t I kill you?\" Julius regarded him in silent terror. \"You didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get away from the cops you set on my track, did you? You thought you\u0027d get rid of me, did you? Where\u0027s that money you got for selling us, eh?\" \"I didn\u0027t sell you,\" said Julius, trembling. \"Don\u0027t lie to me. I know all about it. I followed you when you went with that boy that keeps the necktie stand. I know how much you got. It was fifty dollars.\" Julius was bewildered. He did not understand how Marlowe could have gained this information. \"Do you deny this?\" demanded Marlowe. \"I didn\u0027t know I was to get any money,\" stammered Julius. \"I wouldn\u0027t have told of you, but Paul had been kind to me.\" \"So you forgot all about Jack Morgan and me. You were ready to sell your best friends. But you didn\u0027t count the cost, my chicken! We generally pay up for such favors. I promised Jack I\u0027d settle our account, and I\u0027m goin\u0027 to do it.\" \"Is Jack took?\" asked Julius, shrinking under the man\u0027s fierce glance. \"Yes, he is, curse you! If it hadn\u0027t been for your blabbing tongue we\u0027d both have got off with the swag. Now hand over that money, and be quick about it.\" \"What money?\" faltered Julius. \"You know well enough—the fifty dollars.\" Julius felt thankful now that he had deposited the greater part with Paul. \"I haven\u0027t got it.\" \"You lie!\" exclaimed Marlowe, brutally. \"I gave it to Paul, all except five dollars.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you. Empty your pockets.\" Julius did so, but only five dollars were found. Marlowe was badly disappointed. Fifty dollars would have been of essential service to him, and they had dwindled to five. \"What business had you to give the money to him?\" he demanded, harshly. \"I was afraid I might lose it.\" \"Give me the five dollars.\" Julius reluctantly handed the bill to his enemy, who thrust it into his pocket. \"Now,\" said he, seizing Julius by the shoulder with a dark and menacing look, \"I\u0027ll give you a lesson you\u0027ll remember to the last day of your life.\" He threw Julius upon the ground, and was about savagely to kick the helpless boy, who would in all probability have died from the brutal treatment he was likely to receive, when he was seized by the collar, and sent whirling backward by a powerful hand. \"Avast there, you lubber!\" said the sailor, who had felt it time to interfere. \"What are you about?\" Marlowe turned furiously upon his unexpected assailant. \"I\u0027ll soon let you know, if you don\u0027t leave here pretty sudden. What business is it of yours?\" he said, furiously. \"It\u0027s always my business,\" said the sailor, manfully, \"when I see a big brute pitching into a youngster like that. I ain\u0027t the man to stand by and see it done.\" \"He wants to kill me. Don\u0027t let him,\" implored Julius. \"That I won\u0027t, my lad. He\u0027ll have to kill me, too, if that\u0027s what he\u0027s after. He\u0027ll find me a tough customer, I reckon.\" \"This is my boy. I shall beat him as I please,\" said Marlowe, angrily. \"I am not his boy,\" said Julius, fearing the sailor would credit the statement. \"Don\u0027t you be afraid, my lad. If you were his boy ten times over, he shouldn\u0027t beat you while I am by.\" Marlowe was terribly enraged. He saw his victim slipping from his grasp just as he was about to glut his vengeance upon him. He was a man of violent passions, and they got the better of his prudence. \"Stand back!\" he shouted, advancing toward the intrepid sailor, \"or I will serve you and the boy alike.\" \"I\u0027m ready,\" said the other, coolly, squaring off scientifically. Marlowe aimed a heavy blow at his head, which, had it taken effect, would have prostrated and perhaps stunned him. But it was warded off, and a counter blow returned, which took better effect. Marlowe staggered under it, but it only maddened him. Half-blinded, he rushed once more upon his opponent, but received a well-directed blow full in the chest, which stretched him at the sailor\u0027s feet. The latter forbore to take an unmanly advantage of his foe\u0027s position, but calmly waited for him to rise. \"Do you want more?\" he asked, coolly. Marlowe, had he been wise, would have desisted, but he was filled with a blind, unreasoning rage, and advanced again to the attack. But he was no match for the stout sailor. He fared this time no better than before, but again was stretched at the sailor\u0027s feet. By this time the conflict had attracted attention. Several men came running up, among them a member of the local police. \"What\u0027s the meaning of all this?\" demanded the latter. \"Ask the boy,\" said the sailor. Julius, thus appealed to, answered: \"That man wanted to kill me, but the sailor stopped him.\" \"It\u0027s a lie!\" growled Marlowe. \"He\u0027s my boy, and I was punishing him.\" \"Are you his boy?\" asked the policeman, turning to Julius. \"No.\" \"Where do you live?\" \"In New York.\" \"Do you know him?\" \"Yes.\" \"Who is he?\" Marlowe saw that it was getting dangerous for him, and was anxious to get away. \"The boy may shift for himself,\" he said. \"If you take so much interest in him you can take care of him.\" These last words were addressed to the sailor. He turned on his heel, and hoped to get away without further trouble. \"Stop, there!\" said the officer. \"We haven\u0027t done with you yet.\" \"What do you want?\" demanded Marlowe, endeavoring to conceal his alarm under an air of surly bravado. \"I want to know who you are.\" \"I\u0027m a sailor.\" \"Then you\u0027re a land sailor,\" retorted the true son of Neptune. \"Is he a sailor?\" asked the officer of Julius. \"No, sir.\" \"What is his name?\" \"His name is Marlowe,\" answered Julius, in spite of the black and menacing looks of his enemy, intended to intimidate him. \"Marlowe? The man implicated in the burglary in Madison avenue?\" Julius was not required to answer this, for at the question, showing that he was known, Marlowe with an oath took to flight, closely pursued by all present. He had run half a mile before he was secured. But his pursuers at length caught up with him, and after a sharp struggle, in which they were materially assisted by the powerful sailor, he was taken and bound. \"If I ever get free, I\u0027ll kill you!\" he muttered, between his teeth, to Julius. \"You\u0027ll rue this day\u0027s work.\" Julius, secure as he was at present, could not help shuddering as he heard these threatening words. But he felt thankful that he had escaped the present danger. The peril was over for the time; but Julius could not help feeling that he was not wholly safe as long as Marlowe was at large. I may as well add here that the burglar was delivered to the New York authorities, and in due time had his trial, was convicted and sentenced to ten years\u0027 imprisonment in the prison at Sing Sing. This adventure, and the excitement attending it, spoiled the enjoyment of Julius for the afternoon. He returned to the pier and took passage on the boat bound for the city. He called on Paul at his stand, and surprised him with the news of Marlowe\u0027s capture, and his own narrow escape. \"I am glad to hear it, Julius,\" said Paul. \"So that sailor that followed you was Marlowe.\" \"Yes. Did you see him?\" \"I noticed him two or three times, but had no idea he was following us.\" \"I never should have known him, he looked so different.\" \"He might have got away if he hadn\u0027t been so anxious to revenge himself on you.\" \"He\u0027s got my five dollars,\" said Julius, regretfully. \"It might have been much worse. You\u0027ve got forty-five dollars left yet. Do you want any of it?\" \"You may give me five more.\" Paul drew a five-dollar bill from his pocket and handed it to Julius. \"By the way, Julius,\" he said \"where do you expect to sleep to-night?\" \"In the lodgin\u0027 house.\" \"Come up and stop with me. We can find room for you. Besides, my mother will give you a good supper.\" \"You are very kind to me, Paul,\" said Julius, gratefully. \"I ought to be. You did us all a great service. You must stay with us till it is time for you to go out West.\" Julius made some faint objections, out of bashfulness; but he was so pleasantly received by Mrs. Hoffman, and treated with so much kindness, that he came to feel quite at home, and needed no urging after the first night. Jimmy asked him a multitude of questions about the burglars, how they looked and how they lived, to which Julius answered patiently. \"When you are out West, you must write to us how you are getting along, Julius,\" said Mrs. Hoffman, kindly. Julius blushed, and did not answer. He seemed much embarrassed. \"Won\u0027t you?\" asked Jimmy. \"I don\u0027t know how to write!\" said Julius at last, feeling suddenly ashamed of his ignorance. \"Such a big boy as you can\u0027t write?\" said Jimmy, in amazement. \"There is plenty of time to learn,\" said Paul, cheerfully. \"Julius has had no chance to learn yet, but after he gets to the West he will make it up.\" The mortification which Julius felt at his ignorance made him determine to study hard whenever he could. He felt that if he wanted to occupy a respectable position in society, he must, at least, know how to read and write. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82883.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
