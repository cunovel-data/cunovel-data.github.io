{"id":19180,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. THE DISGUISED LISTENER.","content":"On the Monday morning succeeding the attempt at burglary so happily defeated, Paul thought he ought to go round to the counting-room of Mr. Preston and acquaint him with the particulars. He accordingly deferred opening his place of business—if I may use so ambitious a phrase of the humble necktie stand over which he presided—and bent his steps toward Mr. Preston\u0027s counting-room. The latter had just arrived. \"Good-morning, Paul,\" said Mr. Preston, smiling. \"I know all about it.\" \"About what, sir?\" inquired Paul, surprised. \"About the burglary.\" \"Who told you?\" our hero asked, in astonishment. \"Didn\u0027t you know it was in the papers?\" \"No, sir.\" \"I read it on my way downtown. These reporters get hold of everything. Read that.\" Mr. Preston put into Paul\u0027s hands a morning paper, pointing to the following paragraph: \"On Saturday evening an attempt was made to rob the house of Nathaniel Talbot, No. — Madison avenue. The attempt was made by two well-known burglars, familiarly known as Jack Morgan and Tom Marlowe. The enterprise promised to be successful, as Mr. Talbot is absent in Europe with his family. During his absence the house is taken care of by a Mrs. Hoffman, whose son Paul, a boy of sixteen, keeps a necktie stand below the Astor House. Paul, who seems to be possessed of courage and coolness, learned that the attempt was about to be made, and determined not only to frustrate it, but to get hold of the burglars. He gave information at police headquarters, and when the brace of worthies arrived they met a reception as unexpected as it was unwelcome. They were permitted to effect an entrance, and met with no drawback till they reached the second story. Then the police made their appearance on the scene and effected the capture of Morgan. Marlowe succeeded in effecting his escape, but the police are on his track, and his haunts in the city being known, there is every reason to believe that he will be captured. Great credit is due to the boy Paul, through whose bravery and good judgment Mr. Talbot\u0027s house has been saved from robbery, and probably two noted desperadoes captured.\" Paul read this paragraph with pleasure, as may readily be supposed. He was glad to find that his efforts in Mr. Talbot\u0027s behalf were likely to secure recognition. \"I never thought of getting into the papers,\" he said, looking up. \"I don\u0027t see how the reporters found out about it.\" \"Oh, the reporters are everywhere. Probably they call every evening at police quarters and obtain information of all such cases. You see, Paul, you are getting famous.\" \"I only did what I ought to do,\" said Paul, modestly. \"I agree to that, but that is more than many of us can say. If we all could say it with justice, we should have a very different world from what we have at present.\" \"Besides,\" said Paul, who, though he liked praise, wanted to be just, \"there is some one else, a boy, too, who had more to do with the affair than I.\" \"Who was that?\" \"The boy who told me the house was to be entered.\" \"Tell me all about it. I told you I knew all about it, but there is one thing the paper does not explain how you found out the plans of those villains.\" \"I will tell you, sir. One day I saw a boy in front of the eating-house where I usually dine, who looked hungry. I have known what it was to be hungry myself, and I pitied him. So I asked him in and gave him some dinner. I think it was the next day that he came round and asked me if I did not live in Mr. Talbot\u0027s house on Madison avenue. He said the man he lived with and another were intending to break into it and rob the safe. They seemed to know that my mother and myself were the only ones who occupied it.\" \"How old a boy was he?\" \"I don\u0027t know his age. He looks about twelve, but he may be older.\" \"What do you suppose made him bring you the information?\" \"I think he felt grateful for the dinner I gave him.\" \"Did you see him more than once?\" \"Yes, several times. It seems the two men intended at first to make the attempt this evening, but for some reason they came to distrust the boy, who was acquainted with their plans, and fixed it for Saturday. They didn\u0027t intend to let him know of their change of plan, but he overheard one of them talking in his sleep. He came and told me. This was lucky, as otherwise I should not have been ready for them.\" \"What is the name of this boy?\" \"Julius.\" \"He has certainly done you and Mr. Talbot great service. What is your opinion of him? Has he been spoiled by living with thieves?\" \"I don\u0027t think he has. If he could have a chance to do better, I think he would.\" \"He shall have a chance. I suppose you will see him soon.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder if he would come round to my stand to-day.\" \"If he does, bring him here.\" \"Yes, sir, I will.\" \"What you have told me, Paul,\" continued Mr. Preston, \"does not lessen your own merits. But for your kindness to this poor boy you would have heard nothing of the intended burglary, and been unable to take the measures which have proved so happily successful.\" \"You are determined to praise me, Mr. Preston,\" said Paul. \"Because you deserve it. I shall take care to write particulars to Mr. Talbot, who will doubtless have seen the paragraph you have just read, and will be interested to hear more. I shall not forget your part in the affair.\" \"Thank you, sir. I shall be glad to have Mr. Talbot know that I am faithful to his interests.\" \"He shall know it.\" A boy entered the office at this point, with a number of letters from the post office, and Mr. Preston began to read them. Paul saw that it was time to go, and bade him good-morning. \"Good-morning, Paul,\" said his patron. \"Don\u0027t forget to bring me the boy, Julius.\" \"I won\u0027t forget, sir.\" Paul was not likely to forget, for he, too, felt grateful to Julius, and was glad to think the poor boy was likely to receive a reward for his services. Through the arrest of Jack Morgan he would be thrown upon his own exertions, and aid would doubtless be welcome. Paul felt an honorable satisfaction in knowing that he was rising in the world, and he was unselfish enough to desire to see others prosper also. He was not mistaken in supposing Julius would call upon him. About eleven o\u0027clock he came up to the stand. \"Good-morning, Julius,\" said Paul, cordially. \"Good-morning,\" said the smaller boy. \"Was Jack and Marlowe round to your house last night?\" \"Yes.\" \"Was they took?\" asked Julius, anxiously. \"Morgan was captured, but Marlowe escaped.\" The boy\u0027s countenance fell, and he looked alarmed. \"Do you think they\u0027ll take him?\" \"They are on his track. I don\u0027t think that he can escape.\" \"If he does he\u0027ll kill me,\" said Julius; \"he suspected me afore. Now he\u0027ll know I let out about him and Jack.\" \"He won\u0027t dare to come near you.\" \"Why won\u0027t he?\" \"He knows the police are after him; he\u0027ll hide somewhere.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Julius, thoughtfully. \"He\u0027ll be awful mad with me. He\u0027ll try to do me some harm if he can.\" \"I should be sorry to have any harm come to you, Julius,\" said Paul, earnestly. \"If Marlowe is arrested it will be all right.\" \"He shut me up last night before he went away; Jack and he did.\" \"How was that?\" Julius gave an account of his confinement, and how he escaped through the help of Mrs. O\u0027Connor. He did not know of Marlowe\u0027s subsequent visit to the room, and his disappointment at finding the bird flown. He did not know of this, not having dared to go round there since, lest he should come upon Jack or Marlowe. Now he knew it was only the latter he had to fear. \"You managed it pretty well about getting away,\" said Paul. \"It reminds me of something that happened to me—I was locked up in a hotel once the same way,\" and he gave Julius a little account of his adventure at Lovejoy\u0027s Hotel, with the jeweler from Syracuse, as narrated in an earlier volume of this series, \"Paul the Peddler.\" Julius was interested in the story. \"Have you got any money, Julius?\" asked Paul, when he had finished. \"I\u0027ve got ten cents. I didn\u0027t have much luck this mornin\u0027. I left my blackin\u0027-box in the room, and I didn\u0027t dare to go after it, as I thought I might meet Marlowe or Jack.\" \"Haven\u0027t you had any breakfast, then?\" \"Yes, I went down to the Long Branch boat and got a chance to carry a carpet-bag. The gentleman gave me a quarter; I spent fifteen cents for breakfast, and I\u0027ve got ten left.\" \"You must stop and go to dinner with me, Julius. It is twenty minutes to eleven already. I shall go at twelve.\" \"You spend too much money on me,\" said Julius. \"Never mind that. Where would I be if you hadn\u0027t told me about this burglary? I should have known nothing about it, and I might have been murdered. I\u0027ve told about you to Mr. Preston, a friend of Mr. Talbot, whose house I live in, and he wants me to bring you round to his counting-room. He is going to do something for you.\" Julius brightened up. He had never had any friend excepting Jack Morgan, and the reader can form some idea of the value of such a friend as Jack. \"When does he want me to come to his room?\" he asked. \"I\u0027ll go round with you after dinner. You want to rise in the world, don\u0027t you, Julius?\" \"I\u0027d like to, but I ain\u0027t had any chance.\" \"I think Mr. Preston will give you a chance. You can be thinking what you would like to do, and he will help you to it.\" \"I would like to go out West. I\u0027m afraid to stay here. Marlowe might find me.\" \"I don\u0027t know but you are right, Julius. Out West there is more of a chance to rise. You can tell Mr. Preston what you wish.\" While the boys were talking a man stood near by, who listened attentively to what was said, hearing every word. Neither Paul nor Julius remarked him. He was a tall man, with red hair, and a face marked by the smallpox. He was dressed in the garb of a sailor. Of course this was Marlowe. It was imprudent for him to post himself in so public a place, but he trusted to his disguise, and he wanted to hear for himself the conversation between the two boys. He learned, what he suspected before, that to the boy, Julius, he was indebted for the failure of his attempt at burglary. When the two boys went to dinner he followed them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82880.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
