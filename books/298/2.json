{"id":19162,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. BARNUM\u0027S MUSEUM.","content":"Barnum\u0027s Museum now lives only in the past. Its successor, known as Wood\u0027s Museum, is situated at the corner of Twenty-ninth street and Broadway. But at the time of my story the old Barnum\u0027s stood below the Astor House, on the site now occupied by those magnificent structures, the Herald building and the Park Bank. Hither flowed daily and nightly a crowd of visitors who certainly got the worth of their money, only twenty-five cents, in the numberless varied curiosities which the unequaled showman had gathered from all quarters of the world. Jimmy had often seen the handbills and advertisements of the museum, but had never visited it, and now anticipated with eagerness the moment when all its wonders should be revealed to him. In fact, he waked up about two hours earlier than usual to think of the treat in store for him. Paul, as he had promised, closed up his business at twelve o\u0027clock and came home. At half-past one the three were on their way to the museum. The distance was but short, and a very few minutes found them in the museum. Jimmy\u0027s eyes opened wide as they took in the crowded exhibition room, and he hardly knew what to look at first, until the approach of a giant eight feet high irresistibly attracted him. It is a remarkable circumstance that Barnum\u0027s giants were always eight feet high on the bill, though not always by measure. Sometimes the great showman lavishly provided two or three of these Titans. Where they came from nobody knew. It has been conjectured by some that they were got up to order; but upon this point I cannot speak with certainty. As a general thing they are good-natured and harmless, in spite of their formidable proportions, and ready to have a joke at their own expense. \"Oh, see that big man!\" exclaimed Jimmy, struck with awe, as he surveyed the formidable proportions of the giant. \"He\u0027s bigger than you will ever be, Jimmy,\" said Paul. \"I wouldn\u0027t like to be so tall,\" said the little boy. \"Why not? You could whip all the fellows that tried to tease you.\" \"They don\u0027t tease me much, Paul.\" \"Do they tease you at all?\" asked his brother quickly. \"Not very often. Sometimes they call me Limpy, because I am lame.\" \"I\u0027d like to catch any boy doing it,\" said Paul energetically. \"I\u0027d make him see stars.\" \"I don\u0027t mind, Paul.\" \"But I do. Just let me catch the next fellow that calls you Limpy, and he won\u0027t do it again.\" By this time a group had gathered round the giant. Paul and Jimmy joined it. \"Was you always so large?\" asked a boy at Paul\u0027s side. \"I was rather smaller when I was a baby,\" said the giant, laughing. \"How much do you weigh?\" \"Two hundred and seventy-five pounds.\" \"That beats you, Jimmy,\" said Paul. \"Were you big when you were a boy?\" \"I was over seven feet high on my fifteenth birthday,\" said the giant. \"Did the teacher lick you often?\" asked one of the boys shyly. \"Not very often. He couldn\u0027t take me over his knee very well.\" \"What an awful lot of cloth you must take for your clothes!\" said the last boy. \"That\u0027s so, my lad. I keep a manufactory running all the time to keep me supplied.\" \"Do you think that\u0027s true, Paul?\" asked Jimmy, doubtfully. \"Not quite,\" answered Paul, smiling. \"Don\u0027t you need to eat a good deal?\" was the next question. \"Oh, no, not much. Half a dozen chickens and a couple of turkeys are about all I generally eat for dinner. Perhaps I could eat more if I tried. If any of you boys will invite me to dinner I\u0027ll do my best.\" \"I\u0027m glad you ain\u0027t my son,\" said one of the boys. \"I shouldn\u0027t like to keep you in food and clothes.\" \"Well, now, I shouldn\u0027t mind having you for a father,\" said the giant, humorously looking down upon his questioner, a boy of twelve, and rather small of his age, with a humorous twinkle in his eye. \"You wouldn\u0027t whip me very often, would you?\" Here there was a laugh at the expense of the small boy, and the group dispersed. \"Now, you\u0027ve seen a large man, Jimmy,\" said Paul. \"I\u0027m going next to show you a small one.\" They moved on to a different part of the building, and joined another crowd, this time surrounding the illustrious Tom Thumb, at that time one of the attractions of the museum. \"There\u0027s a little man, smaller than you are, Jimmy,\" said Paul. \"So he is,\" said Jimmy. \"Is that Tom Thumb?\" \"Yes.\" \"I didn\u0027t think he was so small. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m not so little.\" \"No, it might not be very comfortable, though you could make a good deal of money by it. Tom is said to be worth over a hundred thousand dollars.\" \"I guess it doesn\u0027t cost him so much for clothes as the giant.\" \"Probably not. I don\u0027t think he would need to run a manufactory for his own use.\" But there were multitudes of curiosities to be seen, and they could not linger long. Jimmy was particularly interested in the waxwork figures, which at first he thought must be real, so natural was their appearance. There were lions and tigers in cages, who looked out from between the gratings as if they would like nothing better than to make a hearty meal from one or more of the crowd who surrounded the cages. Jimmy clung to Paul\u0027s hand timidly. \"Couldn\u0027t they get out, Paul?\" he asked. \"No, the cages are too strong. But even if they could, I don\u0027t think they would attack you. You would only be a mouthful for them.\" \"I don\u0027t see how Mr. Barnum dared to put them in the cages.\" \"I don\u0027t think Barnum would dare to come very near them. But he has keepers who are used to them.\" But it was time for the afternoon performance to commence. The play was Uncle Tom\u0027s Cabin, which no doubt many of my readers have seen. They got very good seats, fronting the stage, though some distance back. When the curtain rose Jimmy\u0027s attention was at once absorbed. It was the first time he had ever seen a play, and it seemed to him a scene of rare enchantment. To Paul, however, it was much less of a novelty. He had frequently been to Barnum\u0027s and the Old Bowery, though not as often as those boys who had no home in which to spend their evenings. Mrs. Hoffman was scarcely less interested than Jimmy in the various scenes of the play. It was not particularly well acted, for most of the actors were indifferent in point of talent; but then none of the three were critics, and could not have told the difference between them and first-class performers. Both laughed heartily over the eccentricities of Topsy, probably the most original character in Mrs. Stowe\u0027s popular story, and Jimmy was affected to tears at the death of little Eva. To his unaccustomed eyes it seemed real, and he felt as if Eva was really dying. But, taking it altogether, it was an afternoon of great enjoyment to Jimmy, whose pleasures were not many. \"Well, Jimmy, how did you like it?\" asked Paul, as they were working their way out slowly through the crowd. \"It was beautiful, Paul. I am so much obliged to you for taking me.\" \"I am glad you liked it, Jimmy. We will go again some time.\" They were stepping out on the sidewalk, when a boy about Paul\u0027s size jostled them rudely. \"There\u0027s Limpy!\" said he, with a rude laugh. \"You\u0027d better not say that again, Peter Blake,\" he said menacingly. \"Why not?\" demanded Peter defiantly. \"It won\u0027t be safe,\" said Paul significantly. \"I\u0027ll call you Limpy if I like.\" \"You may call me so, and I won\u0027t mind it. But don\u0027t you call my little brother names.\" \"I don\u0027t mind, Paul,\" said Jimmy. \"But I do,\" said Paul. \"No boy shall call you names when I am near.\" Paul\u0027s resolute character was well understood by all the boys who knew him, and Peter would not have ventured to speak as he did, but he did not at first perceive that Jimmy was accompanied by his brother. When he did discover it he slunk away as soon as he could. They were walking up Park Row, when Jim Parker, once an enemy, but now a friend of Paul, met them. He looked excited, and hurried up to meet them. \"When were you home, Paul?\" he asked abruptly. \"Two or three hours since. I have just come from Barnum\u0027s.\" \"Then you don\u0027t know what\u0027s happened?\" Paul turned instantly. \"No. What is it?\" \"Your house has caught fire, and is burning down. The engines are there, but I don\u0027t think they can save it.\" \"Let us hurry home, brother,\" said Paul. \"It\u0027s lucky I\u0027ve got my bank-book with me, so if we are burned out, we can get another home at once.\" Excited by this startling intelligence, they quickened their steps, and soon stood in front of the burning building. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82862.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
