{"id":19178,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. THE VALUE OF A CLOTHES-LINE.","content":"When Julius found himself alone and understood that his companions had actually started on their illegal expedition, he felt that there was pressing need of action. He must escape by some means. While the prospect was that they would be captured, and so prevented from returning, on the other hand, one or both might escape, and in that case he knew enough of their savage and brutal character to realize that he would be in the greatest danger. He rose from his bed, and began to devise ways and means of escape. The first and most obvious outlet, of course, was the door. But this was locked, and the key was in Marlowe\u0027s possession. Then there was the solitary window. It was on the third floor, and looked out into a court. It was too high to jump from, and the only other way was by a rope, but there was no rope in the room. Had there been a bedstead of the right kind, the bedcord would have served his purpose, but there was no bedstead at all. With a democratic contempt for such a luxury, all three slept on the floor. The prospect was not encouraging. \"I wonder if I could hang out of the window?\" thought Julius. He looked out, and decided that he would run the risk of breaking a limb if he attempted it. So that plan had to be given up. Julius sat down and reflected. It occurred to him that perhaps Mrs. O\u0027Connor\u0027s key (she roomed just beneath) would open the door. At any rate it was worth trying. He stamped on the floor with such force that, as he expected, it attracted the attention of those beneath. Listening intently, he heard the woman ascending the staircase. He began to jump up and down with renewed vigor. \"What\u0027s the matter wid ye?\" called Mrs. O\u0027Connor through the keyhole. \"Are you drunk?\" \"I\u0027m sick,\" returned Julius. \"Is it the jumpin\u0027 toothache ye have?\" asked the Irish woman. \"I\u0027m awful sick. I don\u0027t know what it is.\" \"Open the door, and I\u0027ll come in.\" \"I can\u0027t. The door\u0027s locked, and Jack has gone away.\" Here Julius began to groan again. \"Poor bye!\" said the compassionate woman. \"What will I do for ye?\" \"Try the door with your key. Perhaps it will open it.\" \"I\u0027ll do that same.\" She drew out a key, and tried to put it in the lock, but to no purpose. It would not fit. \"I can\u0027t open it,\" she said. This was a severe disappointment to Julius, who saw his chances of success fade away one by one. \"Have you got a clothes-line, Mrs. O\u0027Connor?\" he asked, suddenly. \"Yes,\" said the good woman, rather astonished, with a vague idea that Julius expected to cure himself by means of it. \"And what for do you want it?\" \"If you will go down to the court and throw it up to me, I\u0027ll get out of the window.\" \"And what good will that do you?\" \"I will go for the doctor.\" \"I\u0027ll go meself, and save you the trouble.\" \"But he can\u0027t get through the keyhole.\" \"Thrue for you. Wait a bit, and I\u0027ll do it.\" Mrs. O\u0027Connor descended, and, obtaining from her room a well-worn clothes-line, went below, and, after two or three futile attempts, succeeded in throwing it up so that Julius could seize it. \"Thank you, Mrs. O\u0027Connor,\" said the boy in exultation. \"I\u0027ll come down directly.\" He soon had it secured, and then boldly got out of the window and swung off. In a minute he was by the side of his friend. \"How do ye feel now?\" asked the good woman, in a tone of sympathy. \"Better,\" said Julius. \"What made them lock ye up?\" \"They didn\u0027t think I\u0027d want to go out till mornin\u0027. Good-bye, Mrs. O\u0027Connor; I\u0027m goin\u0027 for the doctor. You can get your line in the mornin\u0027.\" He left the house with a quick, alert step, showing no further evidence of pain. Mrs. O\u0027Connor noticed it, and wondered that he should have got over his sickness so soon. Julius had been tempted to take her into his confidence and explain the real state of the case, but in the uncertain issue of the burglary he decided that it would not be best. \"Good-bye, old house!\" he said, looking back to it in the indistinct light; \"I shall never come back and live here again. I\u0027ll go down to the wharves and find a place to sleep the rest of the night.\" He turned his steps in the direction of the East River. He found an out-of-the-way corner on one of the piers, where he disposed himself for sleep. It was nothing new to him. Scores of times he had spent the night in similar places, and never found fault with the accommodations. They might be poor, but the best of it was there was nothing to pay, and he must be indeed unreasonable who could complain under such circumstances. He fell asleep, but the shadow of recent events was upon him. He dreamed that Marlowe had him by the throat, and woke up in terror to find a dock-hand shaking him by the shoulder. \"Avast there!\" said the man, who had caught some phrases from the sailors; \"wake up and pay for your lodgin\u0027s.\" \"All my money\u0027s in the bank,\" said Julius. \"I can\u0027t get at it till the bank opens.\" \"Not then, either,\" said the dock-hand, good-humoredly. \"Well, I\u0027ll let you off this time. Your wife\u0027s expectin\u0027 you home.\" \"Are you sure of that?\" said Julius. \"I told her I was goin\u0027 to a party, and she needn\u0027t expect me home till mornin\u0027.\" \"Well, the party\u0027s broke up, and you\u0027d better be going,\" returned the other, good-naturedly. Meanwhile let us go back to Marlowe, whom we left hurrying home a little past midnight, intent upon wreaking his vengeance on Julius for his treachery. Had he found the boy it would have gone hard with him. The ruffianly instinct of the burglar was predominant, and he might have killed him in the intensity of his blind rage. But the foresight and prudent caution of Julius defeated his wrathful purpose, and when he reached the shabby room which he called home his intended victim had escaped. Marlowe did not at once discover the boy\u0027s flight. He unlocked the door, but it was dark within, for the window looked out upon an inclosed court, and permitted only a scanty light to enter. Before striking a light he locked the door again and put the key in his pocket. This was to prevent the boy\u0027s escape on the one hand, and any outside interference on the other. Then he drew a match from his pocket and lighted a fragment of candle upon the table. This done he turned his eyes toward the bed with stern exultation. But this was quickly turned into angry surprise. \"The boy\u0027s gone!\" he exclaimed, with an oath. \"How could he have got out, with the door locked?\" The open window and the rope hanging from it revealed the method of escape. Marlowe strode to the window with a feeling of keen disappointment. Was he to be robbed of his revenge, after all? He had depended upon this with certainty, and meant to have it, though he should be arrested the next minute, and he knew that, though he had escaped from the house of his meditated crime, he was still in great peril. Doubtless Julius had given full information to the police of his name and residence, and even now they might be in pursuit of him. He ground his teeth when he thought of this, and clinched his fist in the impotent desire for vengeance. \"If I had him here,\" he muttered, \"I\u0027d crush him as I would a spider,\" and he stamped angrily upon the floor. But where could he have got the rope? that was the next question. He knew that there was none in the room, and how one could have been smuggled in with the door locked was something that puzzled him. Julius himself could not very well have brought one in, as on account of its bulk it would have attracted the attention either of Jack Morgan or himself. Perhaps the woman downstairs might know something about it, he reflected, and this led him to go down and knock at Mrs. O\u0027Connor\u0027s door. After a little pause Mrs. O\u0027Connor came to the door and opened it. \"What\u0027s wanted?\" she asked. Then, recognizing her visitor as one of the lodgers in the room above, she added, \"Is it the boy?\" \"Yes; where is he?\" demanded Marlowe, abruptly. \"It\u0027s gone to the doctor he is.\" \"Gone to the doctor!\" repeated Marlowe, mystified. \"What do you mean?\" \"He was taken sick jist after you wint away, and as he couldn\u0027t open the door which was locked, he pounded on the floor. My key wouldn\u0027t fit, so he asked me to throw up a clothes-line, which I did, and the poor crayther got out of the winder, and wint for the doctor. He\u0027ll be back soon, I\u0027m thinkin\u0027.\" \"No, he won\u0027t,\" growled Marlowe. \"He\u0027s a thief and a villain, and he\u0027s run away.\" \"Did I iver hear the likes?\" exclaimed Mrs. O\u0027Connor. \"Who\u0027d have thought it, shure?\" \"I\u0027ve a good mind to wring your neck, for helping him off,\" said Marlowe, forgetting in his anger the politeness due to the fair sex. \"Would you, thin?\" exclaimed Mrs. O\u0027Connor, incensed. \"Then my husband would do the same to you, you brute! I am glad the boy\u0027s gone, so I am, and I hope he\u0027ll never get into your clutches again, you monster! Tim, wake up there, and defind yer wife from the thafe that\u0027s insulted her!\" Before Tim O\u0027Connor aroused from his sleep at his wife\u0027s call, Marlowe, with a smothered execration, retreated to his own room, and began to consider his position. He must fly. There was no doubt of that. Remaining in his old haunts, he would, unquestionably, fall into the hands of the police, now probably on his track. He must get away, and that very night. Any delay would be dangerous. He must leave the city and remain in hiding for the present. While he was making hurried preparations steps were heard on the stairs, and there was a loud knocking on the door. \"Who\u0027s there?\" demanded Marlowe. \"Open, in the name of the law!\" was the reply of the officers, who had tracked him to his lair. \"Wait a minute,\" said Marlowe. He rushed to the window and descended swiftly by the same rope which had given Julius deliverance (it had escaped the attention of the officers, on account of the darkness), and while the officers were waiting for the door to be opened he eluded their vigilance and made his escape.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82878.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
