{"id":19182,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. MARLOWE OVERTAKES HIS VICTIM.","content":"On emerging into the street the two boys parted company. It was time for Paul to go back to his business. Julius was more indifferent to employment. He had five dollars in his pocket, and forty-five dollars deposited with Paul. Accustomed to live from hand to mouth, this made him feel very rich. It was a bright, pleasant day, and it occurred to him that it would be very pleasant to make an excursion somewhere, it made little difference to him where. The first place that occurred to him was Staten Island. It is six miles from the city or half an hour by water. The boats start from a pier near the Battery. \"Where\u0027s he going, I wonder?\" thought Marlowe, following at a little distance. As no conversation had passed between the boys about the excursion, he was quite in the dark; but he was determined to follow where-ever it might be. He soon ascertained. Julius met a street acquaintance—Tom Barker, a newsboy—and accosted him. \"Tom, come with me.\" \"Where you goin\u0027?\" \"To Staten Island.\" \"What\u0027s up?\" \"Nothin\u0027. I\u0027m goin\u0027 for the benefit of my health. Come along.\" \"I can\u0027t come.\" \"Haven\u0027t you got the stamps? I\u0027ll pay.\" \"I\u0027ve got to go to Twenty-seventh street on an errand. I\u0027ll go with you to-morrow.\" \"Can\u0027t wait,\" said Julius. \"I must go alone.\" \"Goin\u0027 to Staten Island,\" thought Marlowe, in exultation. \"I\u0027ll get a chance at him there.\" Marlowe had not much money with him, but he had enough to pay the fare to Staten Island—ten cents. So he kept on the track of Julius, and passed the wicket just behind him. The boat was approaching the pier, and they had not long to wait. Julius went to the forward part of the boat, and took a seat just in front of the boiler. Marlowe took a position near, but not too near. He had considerable confidence in his disguise, but did not want to run any unnecessary risk of recognition. It so happened that a few steps from him was a genuine specimen of the profession he was counterfeiting. With the sociability characteristic of a sailor, he undertook to open a conversation with Marlowe. \"Hollo, shipmate!\" he said. \"Hollo, yourself!\" said the counterfeit, not over pleased with the salutation. \"I thought I\u0027d hail you, seein\u0027 we both foller the sea. Have you been long ashore?\" \"Not long,\" answered Marlowe. \"Where was your last v\u0027y\u0027ge?\" \"To Californy,\" answered Marlowe, hesitating. \"What craft?\" Here was an embarrassing question. Marlowe wished his questioner at the North Pole, but felt compelled to answer. \"The—Sally Ann,\" he answered. \"You don\u0027t say!\" said the other, with animation. \"I was aboard the Sally Ann myself, one v\u0027y\u0027ge.\" \"Confound you, I\u0027m sorry to hear it!\" thought the impostor. \"There\u0027s more than one Sally Ann, it\u0027s likely,\" he said. \"Who was your captain?\" \"Captain Rice.\" \"Mine was Captain Talbot.\" \"How long was your v\u0027y\u0027ge, shipmate?\" Now Marlowe had no knowledge of the number of days such a voyage ought to take. He knew that the California steamers came in in three or four weeks, and the difference of speed did not occur to him, not to speak of the vastly greater distance round Cape Horn. \"Thirty days,\" he answered, at random. \"Thirty days!\" exclaimed the sailor, in amazement. \"Did you go round the Horn in thirty days?\" \"Yes, we had favorable winds,\" explained Marlowe. \"He must be crazy, or he\u0027s no sailor,\" thought the true son of Neptune. He was about to ask another question, when Marlowe, who suspected that he had made a blunder, turned abruptly, and walked away. \"He ain\u0027t no sailor,\" said the questioner to himself. \"He never lived in the forecastle, I know by his walk.\" Marlowe had not the rolling gait of a seaman, and the other detected it at once. \"Went round the Horn in thirty days!\" soliloquized the sailor. \"That yarn\u0027s too tough for me to swallow. What\u0027s he got on that rig for?\" Meanwhile, Julius looked around him with enjoyment. Cheap as the excursion was, he had but once made it before. It had been seldom that he had even twenty cents to spare, and when he had money, he had preferred to go to the Old Bowery or Tony Pastor\u0027s for an evening\u0027s entertainment. Now he felt the refreshing influence of the sea breeze. He was safe from Marlowe, so he thought. He had left danger behind him in the great, dusty city. Before him was a vision of green fields, and the delight of an afternoon without work and without care. He was sure of a good supper and a comfortable bed; for had he not five dollars in his pocket? Julius felt as rich as Stewart or Vanderbilt, and so he was for the time being. But he would have felt anxious, could he have seen the baleful glance of the disguised sailor; for Marlowe, though he had changed his seat, still managed to keep Julius in sight. But there was another who in turn watched him, and that was the genuine sailor. The latter was bent on finding out the meaning of the disguise, for disguise he knew it to be. He was not long in discovering that Marlowe was watching Julius with a malignant glance. \"He hates the lad,\" thought the sailor. \"Does he mean him harm?\" He was making an excursion of pleasure, but he had another object in view. He had a cousin living on Staten Island, and he was intending to make him a call; but this business was not imperative, and he resolved to follow out the present adventure. \"If he tries to harm the lad,\" said the kindhearted sailor, \"he\u0027ll have to take me too.\" So while Marlowe watched Julius, he was watched in turn. The boat reached the first landing, and some of the passengers got off. But Julius made no motion to disembark, and of course Marlowe did not. Shortly afterward the second landing was reached; but it was not until the boat touched the third that Julius rose from his seat and descended the stairs to the lower deck. The two sailors followed. Julius walked up the road that leads to the pier. He had no particular destination. He cared little where he went, his main object being to get back into the country. The sailor soon perceived that Marlowe had no object except to follow Julius. All his movements depended upon the boy\u0027s. When Julius turned, he turned also. \"What has he got ag\u0027in the boy?\" thought the sailor. \"He shan\u0027t harm him if Jack Halyard can prevent it.\" Marlowe was tall and strong, and a formidable opponent. The sailor was three inches shorter, but he was broad-shouldered, and had an immense chest. It was clear that he was very powerful. He was thoroughly brave also. Fear was a stranger to him, and he did not hesitate for a moment to encounter Marlowe in the boy\u0027s defense. Julius kept on. At one place he stopped to watch two boys who were pitching ball to each other. He asked them if he might join in the game; but the boys looked contemptuously at his shabby clothes, and one of them said, rudely: \"We don\u0027t play with ragamuffins.\" \"I ain\u0027t a ragamuffin!\" said Julius. \"Perhaps you\u0027re a gentleman in disguise,\" said one, with a sneer. \"I\u0027m as much of a gentleman as you are,\" retorted Julius, angrily. \"Clear out, you beggar! We don\u0027t want you here,\" said the second boy, arrogantly. Julius walked on indignantly. \"They insult me because I am poor,\" he said to himself. \"I\u0027ll be rich some time, perhaps.\" The possibility of becoming rich had never occurred to him before to-day; but Mr. O\u0027Connor\u0027s words, and the fifty dollars which had been given him, made him hopeful and ambitious. He had heard that some of the rich men who owned warehouses in the great city had once been poor boys like himself. Might he not rise like them? For the first time in his life he seemed to be having a chance. Marlowe saw him leave the boys with satisfaction. Had Julius stopped to play with them his scheme of vengeance would have been delayed, perhaps frustrated. It would not do for him to attack the boy in the presence of others. But Julius w r as walking away from the village into the interior. If he only went far enough he would be at his mercy. What should he do to him? He might kill him, but killing is rather a dangerous game to play at in a civilized community. \"I\u0027ll take his money,\" thought Marlowe, \"and beat him within an inch of his life. I\u0027ll teach him to betray me!\" At length Julius wandered to a spot solitary enough to suit his purpose. Strange to say, the boy had not turned, or noticed his pursuer. Marlowe was quite out of his thoughts. Who would think of finding him in this quiet scene? But he was destined to be rudely awakened from his dream of security. All at once he felt a hand upon his shoulder. Turning quickly, he saw one whom he supposed to be a sailor. \"What\u0027s wanted?\" he asked. \"You\u0027re wanted.\" \"What for?\" asked Julius, not yet recognizing his enemy. \"Don\u0027t you know me?\" asked Marlowe. \"No.\" \"But I know you, you young villain!\" exclaimed Marlowe, unable longer to repress his fury. \"I\u0027m the man you sold along with Jack Morgan. I\u0027ve got a reckoning with you, my lad, and it\u0027s goin\u0027 to be a heavy one. I haven\u0027t followed you all the way from New York for nothing.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82882.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
