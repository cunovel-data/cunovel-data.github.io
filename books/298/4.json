{"id":19164,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. THE POLICEMAN\u0027S HOME.","content":"It was not till later in the evening that Mr. Norton came in. He had been on duty all day, and to-night he was free. Though one of the constituted guardians of the public peace, he was by no means fierce or formidable at home, especially after he had doffed his uniform, and put on an old coat. \"Edward,\" said his wife, \"this is Paul\u0027s mother, who was burned out to-day. So I have asked her to stay here till she can find a place of her own.\" \"That is right,\" said the policeman. \"Mrs. Hoffman, I am glad to see you. Paul has been here before. He is one of Sam\u0027s friends.\" \"Paul likes to keep in with father,\" said Sam slyly, \"considering he is on the police.\" \"If he is to be known by the company he keeps,\" said Mr. Norton, \"he might have to steer clear of you.\" Here I may explain why Sam was a newsboy, though his father was in receipt of a salary as a policeman. He attended school regularly, and only spent about three hours daily in selling papers, but this gave him two or three dollars a week, more than enough to buy his clothes. The balance he was allowed to deposit in his own name at a savings-bank. Thus he was accumulating a small fund of money, which by and by might be of essential use to him. The group that gathered around the supper-table was a lively one, although half the party had been burned out. But Paul knew he was in a position to provide a new home for his mother, and thus was saved anxiety for the future. \"You have very pleasant rooms, Mrs. Norton,\" said Mrs. Hoffman. \"Yes, we have as good as we can afford. Twenty dollars a month is a good deal for us to pay, but then we are comfortable, and that makes us work more cheerfully.\" \"How do you like being a policeman, Mr. Norton?\" asked Paul. \"I don\u0027t like it much, but it pays as well as anything I can get.\" \"I sometimes feel anxious about him,\" said Mrs. Norton. \"He is liable to be attacked by ruffians at any time. The day he came home with his face covered with blood, I was frightened then, I can tell you.\" \"How did it happen?\" \"I was called in to arrest a man who was beating his wife,\" said the policeman. \"He was raging with drink at the time. He seized one of his wife\u0027s flatirons and threw it at me. It was a stunner. However, I managed to arrest him, and had the satisfaction of knowing that he would be kept in confinement for a few months. I have to deal with some tough customers. A policeman down in this part of the city has to take his life in his hand. He never knows when he\u0027s going to have a stormy time.\" \"I wish my husband were in some other business,\" said Mrs. Norton. \"There are plenty of men that would like my position,\" said her husband. \"It\u0027s sure pay, and just as good in dull times as in good. Besides, some people think it\u0027s easy work, just walking around all day. They\u0027d better try it.\" \"There\u0027s one part Mr. Norton likes,\" said his wife slyly. \"It\u0027s showing ladies across the street.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" rejoined the policeman. \"It gets rather monotonous crossing the street continually, and there\u0027s some danger in it too. Poor Morgan was run over only three months ago, and injured so much that he\u0027s been obliged to leave the force. Then some of the ladies get frightened when they\u0027re halfway over, and make a scene. I remember one old woman, who let go my arm, and ran screaming in among the carriages, and it was a miracle that she didn\u0027t get run over. If she had clung to me, she\u0027d have got over all right.\" \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be a policeman,\" said Sam. \"I might have to take you up, Paul, and I shouldn\u0027t like to do that.\" \"Paul isn\u0027t bad,\" said Jimmy, who was very apt to take a joke seriously, and who always resented any imputation upon his brother. \"He never got took up in his life.\" \"Then he wasn\u0027t found out, I suppose,\" said Sam. \"He never did anything bad,\" retorted Jimmy indignantly. \"Thank you, Jimmy,\" said Paul, laughing. \"I\u0027ll come to you when I want a first-class recommendation. If I never did anything bad, I suppose you won\u0027t call that horse bad that I drew the other day.\" \"It was a bad picture,\" said the little boy; \"but people don\u0027t get took up for making bad pictures.\" \"That\u0027s lucky,\" said Sam, \"or I shouldn\u0027t stand much chance of keeping out of the station-house. I move Jimmy gives us a specimen of his skill. I\u0027ve got a comic paper here somewhere. He can copy a picture out of that.\" \"Where is it?\" asked Jimmy eagerly. The paper was found, and the little boy set to work with great enthusiasm, and soon produced a copy of one of the pictures, which was voted excellent. By that time he was ready to go to bed. Paul and he had to take up with a bed on the floor, but this troubled them little. They felt thankful, under the circumstances, to have so comfortable a shelter. Indeed, Jimmy troubled himself very little about the future. He had unbounded faith in Paul, to whom he looked up with as much confidence as he would have done to a father. Early the next morning Mr. Norton was obliged to enter upon his daily duties. The poor must be stirring betimes, so they all took an early breakfast. \"Mother,\" said Paul, \"it won\u0027t be much use to look up new rooms before the middle of the forenoon. I think I will open my stand as usual, and return at ten, and then we can go out together.\" \"Very well, Paul. I will help Mrs. Norton, if she will let me, till then.\" \"There is no need of that, Mrs. Hoffman.\" \"I would rather do it. I want to make some return for your kindness.\" So the two women cleared away the breakfast dishes and washed them, and then Mrs. Hoffman sewed for two hours upon a shirt which his mother had commenced for Sam. Jimmy amused himself by copying another picture from the comic paper before mentioned. Meantime Paul got out his stock in trade, and began to be on the watch for customers. He bought a copy of the Herald of his friend Sam, and began to pore over the advertisements headed \"FURNISHED ROOMS AND APARTMENTS TO LET.\" \"Let me see,\" soliloquized Paul; \"here are four elegantly furnished rooms on Fifth avenue, only fifty dollars a week, without board. Cheap enough! But I\u0027m afraid it would be rather too far away from my business.\" \"I suppose that\u0027s the only objection,\" said Sam slyly. \"There might be one or two others, Sam. Suppose you pick out something for me.\" \"What do you say to this, Paul?\" said Sam, pointing out the following advertisement: \"FURNISHED NEATLY FOR HOUSEKEEPING. Front parlor, including piano, with front and back bedrooms on second floor; front basement; gas, bath, hot and cold water, stationary tubs; rent reasonable. West Twenty-seventh street.\" \"That would be very convenient, especially the piano and the stationary tubs,\" observed Paul. \"If I decide to take the rooms, you can come round any time and practice on the tubs.\" \"Thank you, Paul, I think I\u0027d rather try the piano.\" \"I thought you might be more used to the tubs. However, that\u0027s too far up town for me.\" \"Are you going to get furnished rooms?\" \"I haven\u0027t spoken to mother about it, but as we have had all our furniture burned up, we shall probably get furnished rooms at first.\" \"Perhaps this might suit you, then,\" said Sam, reading from the paper: \"TO LET—FOR HOUSEKEEPING, several nicely furnished rooms; terms moderate. Apply at — Bleecker street.\" \"That must be near where Barry used to live.\" \"Would it be too far?\" \"No, I don\u0027t think it would. It isn\u0027t far to walk from Bleecker street. But it will depend a little on the terms.\" \"Terms moderate,\" read off Sam. \"They might call them so, even if they were high.\" \"I wish there were some rooms to let in our building.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t mind taking them if they were as nice as yours. How long have you lived there?\" \"We only moved on the first day of May.\" \"How much do you charge for your neckties, boy?\" asked a female voice. Looking up, Paul beheld a tall, hard-visaged female, who had stopped in front of his stand. \"Twenty-five cents,\" answered Paul. \"Seems to me they\u0027re rather high,\" returned the would-be customer. \"Can\u0027t you sell me one for twenty cents?\" \"I never take less than twenty-five, madam.\" \"I am looking for a nice birthday present for my nephew,\" said the hard-visaged lady, \"but I don\u0027t want to spend too much. If you\u0027ll say twenty cents, I\u0027ll take two.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, but I have only one price,\" said the young merchant. \"I\u0027ll give you twenty-two cents.\" \"I shall have to charge twenty-five.\" \"I suppose I must pay it then,\" said the lady in a dissatisfied tone. \"Here, give me that blue one.\" The necktie was wrapped up, and the money reluctantly paid. \"How would you like to be her nephew, Sam?\" asked Paul, as soon as she was out of hearing. \"You might get a nice birthday present now and then.\" \"Shouldn\u0027t wonder if that twenty-five cents bust the old woman! Do you often have customers like that?\" \"Not very often. The other day a young man, after wearing a necktie for a week, came back, and wanted to exchange it for one of a different color.\" \"Did you exchange it?\" \"I guess not. I told him that wasn\u0027t my style of doing business. He got mad, and said he\u0027d never buy anything more of me.\" \"That reminds me of a man that bought a Tribune of me early in the morning, and came back after reading it through and wanted to exchange it for a Times. But I must be goin\u0027, or I\u0027ll be stuck on some of my papers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82864.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
