{"id":19176,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. LOCKED UP FOR THE NIGHT.","content":"About nine o\u0027clock, after a comfortable breakfast, for which he had paid out of his morning\u0027s earnings, Julius went round again to Paul\u0027s necktie stand. He had just opened for business when the boy came up. \"You\u0027re late this mornin\u0027,\" said Julius. \"I was here before.\" \"Yes; I was detained at home. Is there anything new?\" \"Yes, there is,\" said Julius. \"What is it?\" \"They suspect somethin\u0027.\" \"Who?\" \"Jack and Marlowe. They think I ain\u0027t to be trusted.\" \"How do you know? Did they tell you so?\" inquired Paul, with interest. \"No; Marlowe talked in his sleep.\" \"What did he say?\" \"\u0027Don\u0027t trust the boy! Make it Saturday night.\u0027\" \"Saturday night!\" repeated Paul in excitement. \"Why, that\u0027s to-morrow night.\" Julius nodded. \"Do they know you overheard?\" \"No.\" \"So you came and told me. You\u0027re a good fellow, Julius. You have done me a great favor.\" \"You\u0027ve been good to me,\" said Julius. \"That\u0027s why I did it.\" \"I shall be ready for them to-morrow night, then,\" said Paul. This conference was watched, though neither Julius nor Paul was aware of it. Marlowe, on leaving the room some time after Julius, had come into the vicinity with the design of getting a view of Paul and ascertaining whether he was the boy whom he had seen purchasing the coat. He came up a moment after Julius reached the stand. Of course he identified Paul, and his suspicions as to the good understanding between him and Julius were confirmed by seeing them together. He listened intently, hoping to catch something of their conversation, but though not far off, the street noises were such as to render this impossible. \"The young viper!\" he said to himself. \"He\u0027s sold us, as sure as my name\u0027s Marlowe. I\u0027ll wring his neck for him. He\u0027ll find he\u0027s got into dangerous business.\" He went back and reported to Jack what he had seen. \"If I thought the boy was playin\u0027 us a trick,\" growled Jack, \"I\u0027d strangle him; but I ain\u0027t sure. You didn\u0027t hear what he said?\" \"No; I couldn\u0027t hear, but it stands to reason that he\u0027s sold us.\" \"What do you want me to do?\" \"Nothing yet. The boy don\u0027t know that we have changed our plans. He thinks we trust him. Let him think so, and when we get ready to go out Saturday night, we\u0027ll tie him hand and foot, so he can\u0027t stir. Then we\u0027ll go up to the house and take \u0027em unprepared.\" \"All right,\" said Jack. \"Your head\u0027s longer than mine, Marlowe. You know best.\" \"Of course I do,\" said Marlowe. \"You\u0027ve got the strength and I\u0027ve got the brain.\" Jack Morgan extended his arms, and watched his muscular development with satisfaction. He was not sensitive about the slight to his understanding. He was content to be thought what he was, a strong and dangerous animal. What preparations were necessary to be made were made during that day and the next by the two confederates. They were made during the absence of Julius, that he might know nothing of what was going on. Further to mislead him, the two spoke two or three times on the previous evening of their expedition of Monday night. Julius fathomed their design, and was sharp enough not to appear particularly interested. So Saturday night came. At six o\u0027clock Julius entered the room and found the two seated together. He had had half a mind not to appear at all, but to cut loose from them forever; but this would lead to suspicion, and he changed his mind. Though he had not seen Paul since, he had reason to believe that he had made preparations to receive the two burglars. In all probability they would be arrested, and this would be their last meeting. \"How are you, Jack?\" he said, as he entered the room, with a little qualm at the thought that this man, bad as he was, was so near falling into the hands of justice, and by his means. Jack looked at him, but did not answer. His expression was menacing, as Julius perceived, and his heart beat more quickly, as he thought, \"Has he found out anything?\" But luckily for him neither Jack nor Marlowe knew anything definite. Had it been so, the boy\u0027s life would have been in peril. \"Have you seen young Hoffman to-day?\" asked Marlowe. \"No.\" \"He don\u0027t know we\u0027re going to call Monday night, does he?\" \"No,\" said Julius, and he answered truly. \"Where could he find out?\" \"You might say something to let him know.\" \"What would make me do that?\" said Julius boldly. \"You might think he\u0027d pay you for telling him.\" \"He ain\u0027t rich,\" said Julius. \"Do you know what I\u0027d do to you if I found out as you\u0027d sold us,\" here broke in Jack Morgan, his dull eyes gleaming fiercely. \"I\u0027d kill you.\" \"What makes you say that to me, Jack?\" said Julius, not showing the fear he felt. \"Oh, it ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to you, then?\" \"No, it isn\u0027t.\" Of course this was a falsehood, but it would have been idle to expect the truth from one like Julius, under such circumstances. He knew Jack well enough to understand that he was quite capable of carrying out his threat, and it decided him, when the two went out, to go out himself and not to return. They might find out that he had been dealing falsely with them, and if so his life was in danger. It was yet early, and he decided to go out at once, as he usually did, for it was not very agreeable to pass an entire evening in the miserable tenement rooms. \"Where are you going?\" asked Marlowe, as he lifted the latch of the door. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 out. I haven\u0027t had any supper.\" \"You can do without supper to-night, eh, Jack?\" \"Yes, he can do without supper to-night.\" \"Why? What\u0027s up?\" demanded the boy. \"Never mind what\u0027s up,\" answered Marlowe. \"You ain\u0027t goin\u0027 out to-night.\" \"I\u0027m hungry.\" \"We\u0027ll bring you some supper. We\u0027re goin\u0027 out ourselves.\" \"You never kept me in before,\" said Julius, who felt that it was best to show surprise at the action of the confederates, though it did not surprise him. \"That\u0027s neither here nor there. You ain\u0027t goin\u0027 out to-night.\" \"All right,\" said Julius, \"if you say so; only bring a feller some grub.\" \"We\u0027ll bring you some,\" said Jack, who was not as fully convinced as his comrade of Julius\u0027 treachery. They left the room, carefully locking the door behind them. Julius sat down on the bed, and began to review the situation. Evidently he was to be locked up in the room through the night, while Jack and Marlowe were robbing the house on Madison avenue. In all probability they would be arrested, and prevented from returning. But suppose one or both escaped from the trap in which they were expected to fall. If their suspicions of his fidelity were aroused now they would be confirmed by the discovery of the police. Knowing the desperate character of both, Julius reflected with a shudder that his life would possibly be sacrificed. It would not do for him to remain here. He must escape by some means. But how? This was a difficult question to answer. The room was on the third floor, with a solitary window looking out into a small, dirty court. It was too high up to jump with safety, and there was nothing in the room by which he could descend. He was still considering this question an hour later, when the two returned. Jack had in his hand a couple of apples. \"There,\" said he, tossing them to Julius. \"That\u0027ll do you till mornin\u0027.\" \"Thank you,\" said Julius. It was true that he had had no supper, and he ate the apples with a good appetite. The two men sat down, and, producing the same old, greasy pack of cards which they had before used, began to play. It was not until a late hour that they could go about the business which they had planned. Twelve o\u0027clock was as early as they could venture to attempt entering the house. To prime them for the task, they had brought in with them a plentiful supply of whisky, of which they partook at frequent intervals. They offered none to Julius. By and by Julius went to bed. He knew they would not go out till eleven, probably, and he would like to have kept awake till then. But this would have been unusual, and perhaps have increased suspicion. So after awhile he lay quiet, and pretended to be asleep. The men kept on playing cards till half-past ten. Then Marlowe spoke: \"We\u0027ll hold up now. It\u0027s time to be goin\u0027.\" \"What time is it?\" \"Most eleven.\" \"The boy\u0027s asleep.\" \"Is he?\" Marlowe went to the bed and leaned over. Julius felt his breath on his face, but gave no sign that he was still awake. He was filled with curiosity to know whether Marlowe and Jack meant to carry out their plan this evening. \"He seems to be asleep,\" said Marlowe, \"but we\u0027ll lock him in, to make sure. In three hours we\u0027ll be back, if all goes well, with plenty of swag.\" \"I hope so, Marlowe. I\u0027ve got tired of livin\u0027 this way; we\u0027ll go to California if we come out right.\" \"I\u0027m with you, Jack, on that. A pal of mine went out to the mines and got rich. Then he swore off and turned respectable.\" \"So would I, if I had plenty of tin.\" \"I\u0027ve no objection myself, with plenty of money to back me. Money\u0027s what makes the difference between people in this world. Give me a hundred thousand, and instead of bein\u0027 Tom Marlowe I would be Thomas Marlowe, Esq., our eminent fellow-citizen, and you would be the Hon. John Morgan, eh, Jack?\" Jack laughed at the unfamiliar title, though possibly he was no more undeserving of it than some who flaunt it in the face of society. \"I\u0027m the figger for an Honorable,\" he said. \"But it\u0027s time to be goin\u0027. Here\u0027s good luck!\" and he poured down a glass of the whisky at one gulp. They carefully locked the door behind them, and their heavy steps were heard descending the rickety stairs. Julius listened till the sound was no longer heard. Then he jumped up from the pallet on which he had been counterfeiting sleep, and said to himself, \"It ain\u0027t safe to stay here any longer. How shall I get out?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82876.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
