{"id":19174,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. THE SPOT UPON THE COAT.","content":"When Julius went home at six o\u0027clock he found Marlowe and his guardian (if Jack Morgan deserves the title) sitting over a game of cards. They looked up as he entered the room. \"Well, Julius, how are you getting on?\" asked Jack. \"Have you found out anything more?\" \"Not yet, Jack.\" \"Then it\u0027s time you did.\" \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 up to the house to-night.\" \"Does he know it?\" \"Yes; he told me to come.\" \"What made him do that?\" \"I axed him for some old clothes. He told me to come up to-night and he\u0027d give me some.\" \"That\u0027s good,\" said Jack, approvingly. \"Mind you keep your eyes open when you\u0027re there. Find out where the swag is kept. It\u0027ll save me and Marlowe some trouble.\" Julius nodded. \"I\u0027ll do my best,\" he said. \"What time are you going up?\" \"In an hour or so.\" \"I hope we\u0027ll make a haul, Marlowe,\" said Jack. \"I haven\u0027t been in luck lately. If I could raise a thousand or so I\u0027d clear out of these diggings. The cops know me too well.\" \"Where would you go, supposin\u0027 you got the money?\" asked his companion. \"I\u0027d go to California. They don\u0027t know me there. Something might turn up for me.\" \"I\u0027ll go with you, Jack, if you go. I\u0027ve got tired of New York, and, as you say, they know me too well hereabouts. Will you take the boy?\" \"No,\" said Jack carelessly. \"He knows how to take care of himself. He\u0027ll be better off here.\" Julius listened to this conversation, thoughtfully watching the speaker as he spoke, and it helped him to a decision in a matter that had troubled him somewhat. He could not help seeing that Jack Morgan cared nothing for him, except so far as it suited his convenience to have his companionship. Looking back, he could not see that he owed him any gratitude. The balance of favors was on the other side. He had done more for Jack than Jack for him. He asked himself if he wanted to go with Jack Morgan on this journey, and he answered his own question in the negative. It was better that he should leave him now forever. With him he could only look forward to a future of shame and disgrace. \"What are you thinking about, boy?\" asked Marlowe. \"Do you want to go to California with Jack and me?\" \"No,\" answered Julius. \"Why not?\" \"I\u0027d rather stay here,\" answered Julius shortly. \"When I was a lad I\u0027d have liked to go off on a journey like that.\" \"I like stayin\u0027 here.\" \"He\u0027s used to the streets,\" said Jack. \"He likes \u0027em. That\u0027s best, as he can\u0027t go.\" \"Can you take care of yourself?\" asked Marlowe. \"I always has,\" said Julius. \"That\u0027s so,\" said Jack, laughing. \"You ain\u0027t given me much trouble, Julius.\" The men resumed their game, and the boy looked on silently. After awhile seven o\u0027clock struck, and Julius rose from his seat. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027,\" he said. \"All right, Julius. Keep your eyes open.\" \"I know,\" said the boy. He had saved enough money to pay for a ride uptown. He took the Fourth avenue cars, and in half an hour found that he had reached the cross street nearest to his destination. Five minutes later he rang the basement bell of the house in Madison avenue. Paul saw him enter the area, and went himself to open the door. \"Come in, Julius,\" he said. \"I have been expecting you. Have you had any supper?\" \"I bought some coffee and cakes.\" \"I think you can eat a little more,\" said Paul, smiling. \"Mother, can\u0027t you give Julius some dinner?\" \"Is this the boy you expected, Paul?\" \"Yes, mother.\" \"I saved some for him. Sit down at the table, Julius,\" she said hospitably. Julius did as he was told, and directly Mrs. Hoffman took from the oven a plate of meat and vegetables, which had thus been kept warm, and poured out a cup of tea also. These were placed before the young Arab. His eyes lighted up with pleasure at the tempting feast, and the vigor of his assaults showed that the coffee and cakes which he had partaken had by no means destroyed his appetite. Mrs. Hoffman and Paul looked on with pleasure, glad that they had been able to give pleasure to their young visitor. Jimmy, who had heard them speak of Julius, hovered near, surveying him with curiosity. He wanted to \"interview\" Julius, but hardly knew how to begin. Finally he ventured to ask: \"Are you the boy that lives with the robbers?\" \"Jimmy!\" said his mother reprovingly. But Julius was not sensitive. \"Yes,\" he answered. \"Ain\u0027t you afraid of them?\" continued Jimmy. \"What for?\" asked Julius. \"Because robbers are bad men.\" \"They wouldn\u0027t hurt me,\" said the young Arab indifferently. \"You ain\u0027t a robber, are you?\" \"No,\" said Julius in a matter-of-fact tone. \"What makes you live with them?\" \"I haven\u0027t got anybody else to live with,\" said Julius. \"Are they going to rob this house?\" \"Jimmy, you are talking too much,\" said Paul reprovingly. \"I suppose they haven\u0027t changed their plans, have they, Julius?\" \"No.\" \"They mean to come next Monday?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did they know you were coming up here this evening?\" \"Yes; I told \u0027em you were goin\u0027 to give me some clo\u0027es.\" \"Yes,\" said Paul. \"I\u0027ve got a coat for you.\" He opened a bundle and displayed the purchase he had made that afternoon in Chatham street. \"Try it on, Julius,\" he said. Julius took off the ragged coat he had on and tried on the one Paul had purchased. \"It is an excellent fit,\" said Mrs. Hoffman. \"Look at yourself in the glass,\" said Paul. Julius surveyed himself with satisfaction. Though second-hand, the coat was decidedly superior to the one he had taken off. \"It\u0027s a bully coat,\" he said. \"Thank you.\" \"You are quite welcome, Julius. You may as well wear it. You can put your old one in a paper and take it back with you.\" \"Jack wanted me to find out where the money was kept,\" said Julius. \"You may tell him it is in a safe in the front room on the second floor. But how did he expect you would find out?\" \"He left that to me.\" \"And what will you tell him?\" \"I dunno. I\u0027ll think of something.\" \"He won\u0027t suspect you, will he?\" \"I guess not.\" \"Suppose he did?\" \"He\u0027d kill me,\" said Julius. \"What a dreadful man he must be!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hoffman, shuddering. \"How do you dare to live with him?\" \"I shan\u0027t live with him much longer,\" said Julius. \"He said to-night he\u0027d go to Californy if he got swag enough here.\" \"What is swag?\" asked Mrs. Hoffman, bewildered. \"He means money, or articles of value,\" explained Paul. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll go to California, Julius. I think he\u0027ll go somewhere else.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll go,\" said Julius, moving toward the door. \"You need not be in a hurry. We should like to have you stay longer.\" \"He\u0027ll expect me,\" said Julius. \"Go, then, if you think it best. But it is a long distance downtown, and you must be tired. Here is money to pay your fare in the cars.\" \"Thank yer,\" said Julius. He accepted the money, and went out, first, however, promising to call upon Paul the next day at his stand and let him know whether there was any change in Jack Morgan\u0027s plans. \"I pity the poor boy,\" said Mrs. Hoffman, after he went out. \"What a dreadful thing it is to live with such a desperate man!\" \"I will see what I can do to help him next week,\" said Paul. \"We shall owe him something for letting us know of the robbery.\" \"I shudder to think what might have happened if we had been taken by surprise. We might have been murdered in our beds.\" Jimmy looked so frightened at this suggestion that Paul laughed. \"It is no laughing matter, mother,\" he said; \"but Jimmy looked so thoroughly scared that I couldn\u0027t help being amused. Don\u0027t be alarmed, Jimmy. We\u0027ll take good care of you.\" Meanwhile Julius was returning to the miserable room which he called home. He was thinking how he could communicate the information agreed upon without arousing the suspicions of the two confederates. Finally he decided upon a story which seemed to him satisfactory. It was nine o\u0027clock when he entered the room where Jack Morgan and Marlowe, having got tired of playing cards, were leaning back against the wall in their chairs, smoking clay pipes. The room was full of the odor of a villainous quality of cheap tobacco when Julius reappeared. \"Well, Julius,\" said Jack, removing his pipe from his mouth and regarding him eagerly, \"what luck?\" \"Good,\" said Julius briefly \"What have you found out?\" \"I found out that the swag is in a safe upstairs on the second floor.\" \"Good!\" exclaimed Jack, admiringly. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you he was a sharp one, Marlowe?\" \"How did you find that out?\" asked Marlowe keenly. \"You didn\u0027t ask, did you?\" \"I ain\u0027t a fool,\" answered Julius. \"You haven\u0027t answered my question.\" \"They give me some supper,\" said Julius, who had got his story ready, \"and while I was eatin\u0027 I heard Mrs. Hoffman tell Paul that she had got some men to move the safe from the front room on the second floor into the bathroom. She didn\u0027t say what was in it, but it\u0027s likely the money\u0027s there.\" \"The boy\u0027s right, Marlowe,\" said Jack. \"Did they give you anything else besides supper?\" asked Marlowe. \"Yes; they give me this coat,\" answered Julius, indicating the coat he had on. \"Ain\u0027t it a bully fit?\" \"Maybe they\u0027d like to adopt you,\" said Jack jocosely. \"If me and Marlowe go to Californy, you can go there.\" Meanwhile Marlowe\u0027s attention had been drawn to the coat. It struck him that he had seen it before. He soon remembered. Surely it was the one that he had seen purchased in Chatham street the same afternoon. Coats in general are not easily distinguishable, but he had noticed a small round spot on the lapel of that, and the same reappeared on the coat which Julius brought home. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82874.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
