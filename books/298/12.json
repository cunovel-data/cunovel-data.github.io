{"id":19172,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. A GOOD ACTION MEETS ITS REWARD.","content":"Paul Hoffman was standing beside his stock in trade, when all at once he heard the question, so common in that neighborhood, \"Shine yer boots?\" \"I guess not,\" said Paul, who felt that his income did not yet warrant a daily outlay of ten cents for what he could easily do himself. \"I\u0027ll shine \u0027em for nothin\u0027,\" said the boy. Such a novel proposition induced Paul to notice more particularly the boy who made it. \"Why for nothing?\" he asked, in surprise, not recognizing Julius. \"You gave me a dinner yesterday,\" said Julius. \"Are you the boy?\" asked Paul, with interest. \"I\u0027m the one,\" answered Julius. \"Will you have a shine?\" \"I don\u0027t want any pay for the dinner,\" said Paul. \"You\u0027re welcome to it.\" \"I\u0027d rather give you a shine,\" persisted Julius. \"All right,\" said Paul, pleased by his grateful spirit, and he put out his foot. \"Won\u0027t you let me pay for it?\" asked Paul, when the job was finished and his boots were resplendent with a first-class polish. \"No,\" said Julius, hastily drawing back. \"Thank you, then. Have you had good luck this morning?\" \"I got four shines,\" said Julius. \"I once blacked boots myself, for a little while,\" said Paul. \"You\u0027re doin\u0027 better now.\" \"Yes, I\u0027m doing better now. So will you some day, I hope.\" \"Do you live in a house on Madison avenue?\" asked Julius, abruptly. \"Yes,\" said Paul, surprised. \"Who told you?\" \"You take care of the house for a gentleman as has gone to Europe, don\u0027t you?\" \"How do you know it?\" demanded Paul. \"I want to tell you something\" said Julius, \"only don\u0027t you never let on as I told you.\" \"All right. Go ahead!\" said Paul, more and more mystified. \"Ain\u0027t there some gold and bonds kept in the house?\" \"Why do you ask?\" demanded Paul, eying the boy with suspicion. \"There\u0027s a couple of chaps that\u0027s plannin\u0027 to rob the house,\" said Julius, sinking his voice almost to a whisper, and looking cautiously about him to guard against being overheard. \"Who are they? How do you know it?\" asked Paul, startled. \"One is Jack Morgan, the man I live with; the other is a friend of his, Tom Marlowe.\" \"Did you hear them talking about it?\" \"Yes; last night.\" \"Did they tell you about it?\" \"They wanted me to find out all about you—if you\u0027d got any friends in Brooklyn, or anywheres round. They want to get you off the night they\u0027re goin\u0027 to break in.\" \"When is that?\" \"Next Monday.\" \"What made you tell me all this?\" \"\u0027Cause you was good to me and give me a dinner when I was hungry.\" \"Give me your hand,\" said Paul, his heart warming toward the boy who exhibited so uncommon a feeling as gratitude. \"It\u0027s dirty,\" said Julius, showing his hand stained with blacking. \"Never mind,\" said Paul, grasping it warmly. \"You\u0027re a good fellow, and I\u0027d rather take your hand than a good many that\u0027s cleaner.\" Julius, rough Arab as he was, looked gratified, and his face brightened. He felt that he was appreciated, and was glad he had revealed the plot. \"Now,\" said Paul, \"you have told me about this man\u0027s plans; are you willing to help me further? Are you willing to let me know anything more that you find out about the robbery?\" \"Yes, I will,\" said Julius, unhesitatingly. \"Then I\u0027ll depend upon you. What sort of a man is this that you live with? What\u0027s his name?\" \"His name is Jack Morgan. He\u0027s a bad sort, he is. He\u0027s shut up most of the time.\" \"What makes you stay with him?\" \"I\u0027m used to him. There ain\u0027t nobody else I belong to.\" \"Is he your father?\" \"No, he ain\u0027t.\" \"Any relation?\" \"Sometimes he says he\u0027s my uncle, but maybe it ain\u0027t so—I dunno.\" \"Is he a strong man?\" \"Yes; he\u0027s a hard customer in a fight.\" \"How about the other man?\" \"That\u0027s Marlowe. He\u0027s the same sort. I like Jack best.\" \"Do you think they will try to break in next Monday night?\" \"If they think you are away.\" \"What will you tell them?\" \"What do you want me to tell them?\" asked Julius, looking at him earnestly. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Paul, thoughtfully. \"If you should say I was going to be away, they\u0027d want to know where, and how you found out. They might suspect something.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" said Julius. \"Suppose they heard that I would remain in the house, what would they do to prevent it?\" \"They might get you took up on a false charge and put in the station-house over night, or maybe they\u0027d seize you if they got a chance and lock you up somewhere.\" \"How could they have heard that Mr. Talbot left any valuables in the house?\" Julius shook his head. On that point he could give no information. \"You may tell them,\" said Paul, after a moment\u0027s thought, \"that I have an aunt, Mrs. Green, living in Brooklyn.\" \"Whereabouts in Brooklyn?\" \"No. 116 Third avenue,\" said Paul, at a venture. \"Can you remember?\" \"Yes.\" \"They will probably send a message from her late Monday evening for me to go over there.\" \"Will you go?\" \"I will leave the house, for they will probably be watching; but I shall not go far, and I shall leave the house well guarded.\" Julius nodded. \"I\u0027ll tell \u0027em,\" he said. He was about to go, when Paul called him back. \"Won\u0027t you get yourself into trouble?\" he said. \"I should not want to have any harm come to you.\" \"They won\u0027t know I\u0027m in the game,\" answered Julius. \"Will you come to-morrow and let me know what they say?\" \"Yes.\" Julius crossed Broadway and turned into Fulton street, leaving Paul full of thought. He felt what a great advantage it was to be forewarned of the impending danger, since being forewarned was forearmed, as with the help of the police he could prepare for his burglarious visitors. He saw that the money he had paid for a dinner for a hungry boy was likely to prove an excellent investment, and he determined that this should not be the last favor Julius received from him. Meanwhile Julius returned to business. With the help of his blacking materials he succeeded in earning a dollar before the close of the day. Unluckily, half of this was to be given to the young capitalist who had supplied him with a box and brush; but still fifty cents was more than he would probably have earned if he had been compelled to depend upon chance jobs. At six o\u0027clock he met his young employer and handed over fifty cents, which the other pocketed with much satisfaction. \"Do you want to take the box ag\u0027in to-morrow?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" said Julius. \"All right. You can keep it then. You can take it home with you and bring me the stamps to-morrow night at this same hour.\" So the contract was continued, and Julius, having treated himself to some supper, went home. Jack Morgan was already there. He looked up as Julius entered. \"Where\u0027d you get that box?\" he asked. \"I borrored it.\" \"Of a boy?\" \"Yes; I give him half I makes.\" \"How much did you make to-day?\" \"Ten shines. That was a dollar.\" \"And half of it went to you?\" \"Yes, Jack.\" \"Where is it?\" \"I had to get my dinner and supper. There\u0027s all that\u0027s left.\" He handed Jack ten cents. \"Why didn\u0027t you keep the whole of the money?\" grumbled Jack. \"You needn\u0027t have paid the boy.\" \"He\u0027d have licked me.\" \"Then I\u0027d lick him.\" Julius shook his head. \"That would be cheatin\u0027,\" he said. \"I wouldn\u0027t want to cheat him when he give me the box.\" \"Oh, you\u0027re gettin\u0027 mighty particular,\" sneered Jack, not very well satisfied at having so large a portion of the boy\u0027s earnings diverted from himself. \"If I had a box and brush of my own I could keep all the stamps I made,\" said Julius. \"I\u0027m dead broke. I can\u0027t give you no money to buy one. Did you go to see that boy I told you of?\" \"Paul Hoffman?\" \"Yes, if that\u0027s his name.\" \"Yes, I went to see him.\" \"And did you find out anything?\" asked Jack, with eagerness. \"Yes.\" \"Well, out with it, then. Don\u0027t let me do all the talking.\" \"He\u0027s got an aunt as lives in Brooklyn.\" \"Whereabouts?\" \"No. 116 Third avenue.\" \"How did you find out?\" \"I got \u0027him to talkin\u0027.\" \"That\u0027s good. And did he suspect you?\" \"No,\" said Julius. \"No. 116 Third avenue,\" repeated Jack. \"I must put that down. Did he tell you the name?\" \"Mrs. Green.\" \"That\u0027s good. We\u0027ll trump up a message from her late Monday evening. I wish I knew how things was arranged in the house.\" \"Maybe I could go there,\" said Julius. \"What, to the house?\" \"Yes. I could go there in the evenin\u0027 and ask him if he\u0027d let me have some old clothes. Maybe he\u0027d invite me upstairs, and—\" \"You could use your eyes. That\u0027s a good idea, but I don\u0027t believe you\u0027d get a chance to go up.\" \"Shall I try?\" \"Yes; you may try to-morrow night. If we make a haul, you shall have your share. Halloo, Marlowe!\" These last words were addressed to Marlowe, who entered unceremoniously without knocking. \"I\u0027m in luck,\" said Marlowe. \"Here\u0027s a fiver,\" and he displayed a five-dollar greenback. \"Come out and we\u0027ll have a jolly supper.\" Jack accepted the invitation with alacrity, communicating to his companion as they walked along the information Julius had picked up. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82872.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
