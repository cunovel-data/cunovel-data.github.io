{"id":19166,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. PAUL TAKES A HOUSE ON MADISON AVENUE.","content":"Paul kept on his way to the office of Mr. Preston. Those who have read the previous volume will remember him as a gentleman whose acquaintance Paul had made accidentally. Attracted by our hero\u0027s frank, straightforward manner and manly bearing, he had given him some work for his mother, and on other occasions had manifested an interest in his welfare. He now held one hundred and fifty dollars belonging to Paul, or rather to Mrs. Hoffman, for which he allowed legal interest. On entering the mercantile establishment, of which Mr. Preston was at the head, Paul inquired for him of one of the salesmen. \"He is in his office,\" said the latter. \"Can I see him?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Do you want to see him personally?\" \"Yes, if he has time to see me.\" \"From whom do you come?\" \"I come on my own business.\" \"Then I don\u0027t think you can see him,\" said the clerk, judging that a boy\u0027s business couldn\u0027t be very important. \"If you will be kind enough to carry in my name,\" said Paul, \"Mr. Preston will decide that.\" Paul happened to have in his pocket a business card of the firm from which he bought the silk used in making up his neckties. He wrote on the back his name, PAUL HOFFMAN, and presented it to the clerk. The latter smiled a little superciliously, evidently thinking it rather a joke that a boy of Paul\u0027s age should think himself entitled to an interview with Mr. Preston during business hours, and on business of his own. However, he took the card and approached the office. \"There\u0027s a boy outside wishes to see you, Mr. Preston,\" he said. \"From whom does he come?\" asked his employer, a portly, pleasant-looking gentleman. \"On business of his own, he says. Here is his card.\" \"Oh, to be sure. Paul Hoffman!\" repeated Mr. Preston, glancing at the card. \"Tell him to come in.\" \"I wonder what business he can have with Mr. Preston,\" thought the clerk, considerably surprised. \"You can go in,\" he said on his return. Paul smiled slightly, for he observed and enjoyed the other\u0027s surprise. \"Well, my young friend,\" said Mr. Preston cordially, \"how are you getting on?\" \"Pretty well in business, sir,\" answered Paul. \"But we got burned out yesterday.\" \"How burned out?\" \"I mean the tenement house in which we lodged was burned down.\" \"No one injured, I hope.\" \"No, sir; but we lost what little we had there.\" \"Were you at home at the time?\" \"No, sir; my mother and little brother and myself were at Barnum\u0027s Museum. But for that we might have saved some of our clothing.\" \"Well, have you got a new place?\" \"No, sir; we are stopping at the rooms of some friends. I am looking out for some furnished rooms, as I don\u0027t want to buy any new furniture. As all our clothes are burned, I may have to draw fifty dollars of the money in your hands.\" \"How much rent do you expect to pay?\" \"I suppose we must pay as much as twenty dollars a month for comfortable furnished rooms.\" \"Can you afford that?\" \"My business brings me in as much as fifty dollars a month.\" \"You haven\u0027t engaged rooms yet?\" \"No, sir; my mother and I went out to look at some this morning. We only saw one place that suited us. That we could have got for twenty-two dollars and a half rent, but when they heard of my little brother they wouldn\u0027t take us.\" \"I see. Some persons object to young children. I am glad you have not engaged a place yet.\" Paul looked at Mr. Preston inquiringly. \"A gentleman of my acquaintance,\" proceeded the merchant, \"is about sailing to Europe with his family. He is unwilling to let his house, fearing that his furniture would be injured. Besides, the length of his stay is uncertain, and he would want to go into it at once if he should return suddenly. What I am coming to is this. He wants some small family to go in and take care of the house while he is away. They would be allowed to live in the basement and use the chambers on the upper floor. In return they would receive the rent free. How would your mother like to make such an arrangement?\" \"Very much,\" answered Paul promptly. He saw at a glance that it would be a great thing to save their rent, amounting, at the sum they expected to pay, to more than two hundred and fifty dollars a year. \"Where is the house?\" \"It is in Madison avenue, between Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth streets.\" This was a considerable distance uptown, about three miles away from his place of business; but then Paul reflected that even if he rode up and down daily in the cars the expense would be trifling, compared with what they would save in house-rent. Besides, it would be rather agreeable to live in so fashionable a street. \"Do you think my mother can get the chance?\" he asked. \"I think so. The gentleman of whom I spoke, Mr. Talbot, expects to sail for Europe next Wednesday, by the Cunard Line. So the matter must be decided soon.\" \"Shall I call upon Mr. Talbot,\" asked Paul, \"or shall you see him?\" \"Here he is, by good luck,\" said Mr. Preston, as the door opened and an elderly gentleman entered. \"Talbot, you are just the man I want to see.\" \"Indeed! I am glad to hear that. What is it?\" \"Have you arranged about your house yet?\" \"No; I came in partly to ask if you knew of any trustworthy family to put in while I am away.\" \"I can recommend some one who will suit you, I think,\" returned Mr. Preston. \"The young man at your side.\" \"He hasn\u0027t got a family already?\" inquired Mr. Talbot, with a humorous glance at our hero. \"It seems to me he is rather forward.\" \"I believe not,\" said Mr. Preston, smiling; \"but he has a mother, a very worthy woman, and a little brother. As for my young friend himself, I can recommend him from my own knowledge of his character. In fact, he has done me the honor of making me his banker to the extent of a hundred and fifty dollars.\" \"So that you will go bail for him. Well, that seems satisfactory. What is his name?\" \"Paul Hoffman.\" \"Are you in a counting-room?\" asked Mr. Talbot, turning to Paul. \"No, sir; I keep a necktie stand below the Astor House.\" \"I must have seen you in passing. I thought your face looked familiar. How much can you make now at that?\" \"From twelve to fifteen dollars a week, sir.\" \"Very good. That is a good deal more than I made at your age.\" \"Or I,\" added Mr. Preston. \"Paul was burned out yesterday,\" he added, \"and is obliged to seek a new home. When he mentioned this to me, I thought at once that you could make an arrangement for your mutual advantage.\" \"I shall be glad to do so,\" said Mr. Talbot. \"Your recommendation is sufficient, Mr. Preston. Do you understand the terms proposed?\" he continued, addressing Paul. \"Yes, sir, I think so. We are to have our rent free, and in return are to look after the house.\" \"That is right. I don\u0027t wish the house to remain vacant, as it contains furniture and articles of value, and an empty house always presents temptations to rogues. You will be free to use the basement and the upper floor. When the rest of the house needs cleaning, or anything of that kind, as for instance when I am about to return, it will be done under your or your mother\u0027s oversight, but I will pay the bills. Directions will be sent you through my friend Mr. Preston.\" \"All right, sir,\" said Paul. \"How soon would you wish us to come?\" \"I would like you and your mother to call up this evening and see Mrs. Talbot. You can move in next Tuesday, as we sail for Europe on the following day.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Paul in a tone of satisfaction. \"I will expect you and your mother this evening. My number is ——.\" \"We will be sure to call, sir.\" Mr. Talbot now spoke to Mr. Preston on another topic. \"Oh, by the way, Paul,\" said Mr. Preston in an interval of the conversation, \"you said you wanted fifty dollars.\" \"I don\u0027t think I shall need it now, Mr. Preston,\" answered Paul. \"I have some other money, but I supposed I might have to pay a month\u0027s rent in advance. Now that will not be necessary. I will bid you good-morning, sir.\" \"Good-morning, Paul. Call on me whenever you need advice or assistance.\" \"Thank you, sir; I will.\" \"That\u0027s what I call a good day\u0027s work,\" said Paul to himself in a tone of satisfaction. \"Twenty dollars a month is a good deal to save. We shall grow rich soon at that rate.\" He determined to go home at once and announce the good news. As he entered the room his mother looked up and inquired: \"Well, Paul, what news?\" \"I\u0027ve engaged a house, mother.\" \"A house? Where?\" \"On Madison avenue.\" \"You are joking, Paul.\" \"No, I am not, or if I am, it\u0027s a good joke, for we are really to live in a nice house on Madison avenue and pay no rent at all.\" \"I can\u0027t understand it, Paul,\" said his mother, bewildered. Paul explained the arrangement which he had entered into. It is needless to say that his mother rejoiced in the remarkable good luck which came to them just after the misfortune of the fire, and looked forward with no little pleasure to moving into their new quarters. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82866.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
