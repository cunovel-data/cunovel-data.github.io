{"id":19177,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. TRAPPED.","content":"It was close upon midnight when Marlowe and Jack approached the house in Madison avenue. There was one thing connected with the position of the house, not before mentioned, which favored their attempt. It was a corner house, and in the rear a high wall separated the area from the street. The two confederates judged that this would be the most feasible way of entrance. \"Boost me up, Marlowe, first,\" said Jack Morgan. \"You\u0027re lighter\u0027n me, and can get up alone. I\u0027m fat and clumsy, and I couldn\u0027t \u0027go it alone\u0027 to save my neck.\" \"All right, Jack. Are you ready?\" \"Yes. Shove away.\" Jack, raised by his companion, got firm hold of the top of the wall, and by an effort clambered over. \"I\u0027m over, all right,\" he said, in a low voice. \"Get over yourself.\" Marlowe looked cautiously up and down the street, till he was satisfied no policeman was in sight, then, making a leap, seized the wall, and, by the exercise of his strength, drew himself up, and then, of course, easily descended into the area. \"Here we are,\" said Jack, in a tone of satisfaction. \"Now for work.\" \"The lights are all out,\" said Marlowe, softly. \"I hope they are all asleep.\" \"It\u0027s likely they are.\" \"Did Julius say whether any of them slept in the basement?\" \"He didn\u0027t find out.\" \"Well, we must risk it. We\u0027ll reconnoiter a little and see what\u0027s the best way to get in.\" At length it was decided that a particular window afforded the easiest ingress. Of course it was fastened inside; but they were not novices, and this presented not the slightest difficulty to their practiced hands. With an instrument pointed with a diamond, they cut out the pane of glass just beneath, and, thrusting in a hand, Marlowe turned back the fastening. Then the window was softly raised, and both entered. They were now in the kitchen. It was dangerous to grope about in the dark, for some article of furniture might be overturned, and that would probably create an alarm which would be fatal to their plans. The first thing, therefore, was to strike a light. They had a dark lantern with them, and this was speedily lighted. Then both removed their shoes, and one after the other filed into the entry. \"Take care, Jack,\" said Marlowe. \"The woman may be sleeping in the front basement, and might hear you if you make the least noise.\" \"Suppose she does?\" \"We must gag her. If it\u0027s the boy, I\u0027ll dispose of him pretty quick.\" All was still as death. Neither had the slightest idea that their plan was known, and that preparations of a most unwelcome character had been made for their reception—that, in fact, they had ventured into a trap. But on the previous evening Paul had called at the nearest police station, and, communicating what he knew in regard to the intended attack, had asked for a guard. One of the force had been instructed to go back with him and carefully examine the house, the better to provide, not only for defense, but for the capture of the burglars. \"They will enter through the back area window,\" said the officer at once. \"Where do you sleep?\" \"My mother and little brother sleep in the front basement. I sleep upstairs.\" \"The basement must be left vacant.\" \"Certainly. I wouldn\u0027t trust mother and Jimmy there such a night.\" \"You had better all go upstairs—to the upper floor, if you like—and we will conceal ourselves on the second floor.\" \"We will do as you think best. I will stay with you.\" \"No, Paul,\" said Mrs. Hoffman, terrified. \"I can\u0027t think of your exposing yourself to so much danger.\" \"I\u0027m not afraid, mother. I think it is my duty.\" \"You can do no good,\" said the officer. \"There will be enough of us to take care of them.\" With some reluctance Paul gave up his plan. He was bold and courageous, and, like most boys of his age, he was fond of adventure. An encounter with burglars promised no little excitement, and he wanted to be present, and have his share in it. But when he saw how uneasy and alarmed his mother was, he yielded his desire, as I am sure you, my boy reader, would have done in his place, even had your wish been as strong as his. Jimmy was now fast asleep; but neither Mrs. Hoffman nor Paul could so readily compose themselves to slumber under the circumstances. They were standing at the head of the attic stairs, listening intently for the slightest sound from below which might indicate the arrival of the expected visitors. At length they heard a pistol shot, then a shriek, then confused noises of feet and voices, and they knew that the encounter had taken place. We must go back and explain what had happened. Carrying their shoes in their hands, the two burglars crept up the basement stairs. Their hopes were high. Their entrance had not yet been observed, and even if it were, they were two strong men against a woman and two boys, the oldest only half-grown. There seemed nothing to fear. \"Now for the safe,\" said Marlowe. \"It\u0027s somewhere on the second floor.\" \"The door of the room may be locked.\" \"Then it\u0027ll take us longer, that\u0027s all.\" But the door was not locked, and the safe was in the front room on the second floor. In the back room the police were concealed, and were listening intently to the movements of the burglars. Should the latter discover them they were ready for an immediate attack, but they hoped the visitors would get to work first. In this hope they were gratified. By chance the two confederates entered the front room first. \"Here\u0027s the safe, Marlowe,\" whispered Jack, in tones of satisfaction. \"Now, if luck\u0027s on our side, we\u0027ll make a raise.\" \"You talk too much,\" cautioned his companion. \"Work first, and talk afterward.\" They approached the safe, and Jack kneeled down before it and prepared to effect an entrance. Marlowe was about to follow his example, when his ear, made acute by necessity, distinguished a footstep outside. \"Jack,\" said he in a sharp whisper, \"I hear a step outside.\" Instantly Jack Morgan was on his feet. \"Do you think we are heard?\" \"Perhaps so. If we are we must secure ourselves. It may be the boy. If it is, we\u0027ll quiet him pretty quickly.\" They never dreamed of any opposition which they would be unable to withstand. Paul was, of course, no match for them, and as to Mrs. Hoffman, she might go into a fit of hysterics, or might give the alarm. It would be easy to dispose of her. Since, therefore, there was nothing to fear, the two confederates thought it best to face the enemy at once and put him hors de combat. Thereupon Marlowe opened the door at once, and, to his dismay, found himself confronted by four stalwart policemen. \"The game\u0027s up, Jack!\" he shouted. \"Save yourself!\" He made a spring, eluding the grasp of the officers, and plunged downstairs at a breakneck rate. Meanwhile Jack had snapped a pistol at one of the policemen, but it missed fire. By a return shot he was wounded in the shoulder, and his right arm hung useless. He broke into a volley of execrations. \"Do you surrender?\" demanded the officer, at whom he had fired. \"I must,\" said Jack, in a surly tone. \"You\u0027re four to one.\" Only one policeman had followed Marlowe downstairs. Circumstances favored the escape of this, the more dangerous villain of the two. At the foot of the basement stairs was a door, and on the outside was a bolt. This Marlowe had noticed on going up, and the knowledge stood him in good stead. He got downstairs sufficiently in advance of the policeman to bolt the door and so obstruct his progress. This gave him time, and time was all-important to him. While the officer was kicking at the door and trying to burst it open, as he finally did, Marlowe dashed through the kitchen and got out at the open window. Then he had to scale the wall; but this was easy to do on the inside, for there was a narrow ledge midway. In less than a minute he was on the pavement outside, and fleeing from the danger under cover of the darkness. When he had got far enough to dare to slacken his pace time also came for thought, and he was able to consider how it happened that four officers were concealed in the house. There was but one possible explanation. \"It was that cursed boy!\" he muttered, grinding his teeth in a fierce rage. \"He betrayed us. He upset the likeliest plan I\u0027ve joined in for years. He shall suffer for it, curse it! Before I go to sleep this night I\u0027ll give him a lesson. He won\u0027t need but one.\" His soul thirsting for revenge, he hurried back to the miserable room in which Julius was confined. He had no doubt of finding him, for he was satisfied the boy could not get out. Meanwhile Jack Morgan was compelled, by superior force, to surrender at discretion. The blood was trickling from the wound in his shoulder, and on the whole, he looked the burglar to perfection. While they were slipping on the handcuffs the officer who had pursued Marlowe returned and reported that he had escaped. \"Bully for him!\" said Jack. \"He\u0027s smart, Marlowe is!\" \"So his name is Marlowe, is it?\" \"You knew it before,\" said Jack, in a surly tone. \"Who told you about our coming here to-night?\" \"Never mind!\" said the officer. \"It was our business to find out, and we found out.\" \"I know well enough who blabbed,\" growled Jack. \"Curse him! I\u0027d like to strangle him.\" \"I don\u0027t know whom you suspect, my man,\" said the officer; \"but I think it\u0027ll be some time before you\u0027ll have a chance to carry out your benevolent purpose.\" \"Perhaps it will,\" returned Jack; \"but Marlowe ain\u0027t took yet. He\u0027ll attend to the business for both of us;\" and there wis a look of malignant joy on his face as he thought of the sure retribution that would overtake Julius.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82877.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
