{"id":19179,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. A CURIOSITY SHOP.","content":"Marlowe realized that he had made the city too hot to hold him. The police, with whom he had a more intimate acquaintance than he desired, were already on his track, and it was doubtful if he could escape. The affair in which he was implicated was a serious one, and if arrested and tried he could hardly hope for less than ten years\u0027 imprisonment. This is rather a long term of confinement to be taken out of a man\u0027s life, and must be avoided if possible. But one way of escape seemed feasible, and this Marlowe tried, as a desperate experiment. He made his way swiftly through the darkness to a tumble-down building not far from Baxter street. The front door was unlocked. He opened it, and feeling his way up—for there were no lights—knocked in a peculiar way at a door just at the head of the stairs. His knock was evidently heard, for shuffling steps were heard within, a bolt was drawn, and Marlowe confronted a little old man, of feeble frame and deeply furrowed face, who scanned the face of his visitor by the light of a candle which he held above his head. \"Why, it\u0027s Marlowe!\" he said. \"Hush, Jacob! don\u0027t mention my name! I\u0027m in trouble.\" \"What\u0027s in the wind now?\" \"Shut the door and I\u0027ll tell you.\" I may as well say that the conversation which ensued was interlarded with expressions common to the lawless class which Marlowe represented, but I prefer to translate them into common speech. The room which they entered seemed full of odds and ends of wearing apparel, and might have been taken for a pawnbroker\u0027s shop, or second-hand clothing store. Or it might have been taken for a dressing-room to a theatre, but that the articles displayed had long since seen their best days, with few exceptions. \"What have you been up to?\" asked Jacob, varying the form of his question. \"Jack Morgan and I tried to break into a house on Madison avenue to-night.\" \"Couldn\u0027t you get in?\" \"Yes; but the police were in waiting for us. They nabbed Jack, but I got away. They followed me to Jack\u0027s room, but I got out of the window. They\u0027re on my track now.\" \"They didn\u0027t see you come in here?\" asked the old man, alarmed. \"No, I have given them the slip. But they\u0027ll have me unless you help me.\" \"My son, I\u0027ll do what I can. What is your plan?\" \"To disguise myself so that my own mother wouldn\u0027t know me. See what you can do for me.\" My reader will now understand the character of the old man\u0027s business. Thieves, and others who had rendered themselves amenable to the law, came to him for disguises, paying heavily for the use of what articles he supplied them. In many cases he was obliged to give them credit, but the old adage, \"There is honor among thieves,\" was exemplified here, for he seldom failed, sooner or later, to receive full payment. It might be, and probably was, from motives of policy that his customers were so honorable; for if unfaithful to their agreements they could hardly expect to be accommodated a second time, and this was a serious consideration. When appealed to by Marlowe, Jacob understood that the details of the disguise were left to his judgment. He raised his candle, and took a good look at his customer. Then he dove under a heap of clothing on the floor, and fished out a dirty sailor\u0027s dress. \"Try it on,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" said Marlowe, hesitating. \"I don\u0027t know any sailor\u0027s lingo.\" \"That\u0027s no matter. You can say, \u0027shiver \u0027my timbers,\u0027 can\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, I can do that.\" \"That\u0027s enough. It\u0027s all I know myself. But it won\u0027t do any harm to pick up something else; the police won\u0027t never think of you as a sailor.\" \"I don\u0027t know but you\u0027re right, Jacob, shiver my timbers if I don\u0027t!\" and he laughed as he used the expression. \"Try it on. I guess it\u0027ll be about right,\" said the old man. Marlowe quickly stripped off the suit he wore, and arrayed himself in the strange and unfamiliar garb presented. By good luck it had originally been made for a man of about his size, and there was no discrepancy likely to excite suspicion. \"Let me look at myself,\" said he. Jacob produced a small cracked glass, and the ex-burglar surveyed his transformed figure. \"What do you think of it?\" asked the dealer. \"The dress is well enough, but they\u0027ll know my face.\" \"Sit down.\" \"What for?\" \"I must cut your hair.\" \"What then?\" \"I\u0027ll give you a red wig. There\u0027s nothing will disguise you so quick as different colored hair.\" \"Have you got a wig?\" \"Yes, here it is.\" \"It\u0027s ugly enough.\" \"Better wear it than your own hair at Sing Sing.\" \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re right, old man! Go ahead. You understand your business. I\u0027ll put myself in your hands.\" Marlowe sat down in a wooden chair with a broken back, and the old man proceeded, with trembling hands, to cut his black locks with a pair of large shears, which he kept for this and other purposes. \"You\u0027re cutting it pretty close, Jacob. I shall look like a scarecrow.\" \"All the better,\" said the old man, laconically. When the operation was over, Marlowe surveyed his closely-cropped head in the cracked mirror with some disgust. \"You\u0027ve made a beauty of me,\" he said. \"However, it had to be done. Now where\u0027s that wig?\" He was adjusting it awkwardly, when Jacob took it from his hands and put it on properly. \"Now look at yourself,\" he said. Marlowe did look, and, as the old man had predicted, found his looks so transformed that he hardly knew himself. \"That\u0027s good,\" he said, in a tone of satisfaction. \"It don\u0027t improve my beauty, but then I ain\u0027t vain. I care more for my liberty. If it hadn\u0027t been for that cussed boy there wouldn\u0027t have been any need of this.\" \"What boy?\" \"Jack Morgan\u0027s boy—Julius.\" \"What did he do?\" \"He split on us—gave warning of our attempt. That\u0027s how we came to be taken. I\u0027d give something to get at him.\" \"Maybe you will.\" \"I\u0027ll try, at any rate. If not now, my revenge will keep. Is that all?\" \"Not quite. Sit down again.\" The old man stained the face of his visitor so adroitly that he appeared to be deeply pitted with smallpox. \"Your own mother wouldn\u0027t know you now,\" he said with pride. \"That\u0027s so, Jacob! you\u0027re a regular genius,\" replied Marlowe. \"I ain\u0027t sure about it\u0027s being me. You\u0027re sure about it?\" \"Shiver your timbers!\" said the old man. \"Shiver my timbers, but I forgot about it! Do you think I\u0027ll do?\" \"Yes; but you mustn\u0027t wash your face till it is dry.\" \"I sometimes forget to do it now. I guess I can get along without it for a day or two. Now, how much are you going to ask for all this?\" \"Seventy-five dollars.\" \"It\u0027s a good deal.\" \"How long would you get if you got took?\" asked Jacob, significantly. \"You\u0027re right. It\u0027s worth the money. But I can\u0027t pay you now, Jacob.\" \"You won\u0027t forget it,\" said the old man, composedly, for he expected this, since Marlowe\u0027s attempt at burglary had been unsuccessful. \"You\u0027ll pay me when you can.\" \"Shiver my timbers, messmate, but I will!\" \"Good!\" said the old man. \"You\u0027re getting it.\" \"I don\u0027t think those landlubbers—the cops—will know me in this rig-out.\" \"Better. You\u0027ll do.\" \"Well, Jacob, I\u0027ll pay you as soon as I can. By the way, haven\u0027t you any place where you can stow me for the night? It won\u0027t do for me to go back to Jack\u0027s room; it\u0027s too hot for me.\" \"Lay down anywhere,\" said Jacob. \"I haven\u0027t got any bed; I lie down on the clothes.\" \"That\u0027ll do; I ain\u0027t used to bridal-chambers or silk counterpanes. I am as tired as a dog. Here goes!\" He flung himself down in a corner on an indiscriminate pile of clothing, and in five minutes was breathing deeply, and fast asleep. Had he been a novice in his illegal profession, the two narrow escapes he had just had, and the risk which, in spite of his disguise he at present run, would have excited him and prevented his sleeping; but he was an old hand and used to danger. It was not the first time he had eluded the authorities, and was not likely to be the last, so he fell asleep upon his strange couch, and slept as unconcernedly as an infant. The old man did not immediately lie down. He held up and examined attentively the suit Marlowe had thrown oft, which, according to custom, became his perquisite, in addition to the cash payment demanded, and was gratified to find it in good condition. He next plunged his hands into the pockets, but Marlowe had transferred their contents to his new attire. However, Jacob would have been little richer had his visitor neglected to do so. Having finished his scrutiny the old man blew out the candle and lay down in the corner opposite Marlowe.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82879.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
