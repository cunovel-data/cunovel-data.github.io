{"id":19173,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. PAUL MAKES A PURCHASE.","content":"It is not very pleasant to be informed that your house is to be entered by burglars. Still, if such an event is in prospect, it is well to know it beforehand. While Paul felt himself fortunate in receiving the information which Julius gave him, he also felt anxious. However well he might be prepared to meet the attack, he did not like to have his mother and Jimmy in the house when it was made. Burglars in nearly every case are armed, and if brought to bay would doubtless use their arms, and the possible result of a chance shot was to be dreaded. On Monday night, therefore, if that should be the one decided upon by the burglars, he made up his mind that his mother and Jimmy should sleep out of the house. He lost no time in proposing this plan to his mother. \"Mother,\" said he on reaching home, \"I have had some news to-day.\" \"Not bad, I hope?\" said Mrs. Hoffman. \"I leave you to judge,\" answered Paul, with a smile. \"We are to have visitors next Monday evening.\" \"Visitors, Paul? Who are they?\" \"Mr. Jack Morgan and Mr. Marlowe.\" \"Are they friends of yours? I never heard you mention them.\" \"I never saw them that I know of.\" \"Then why did you invite them here?\" \"They invited themselves.\" \"I don\u0027t understand it, Paul. If you don\u0027t know them, why should they invite themselves here?\" \"Perhaps you\u0027ll understand me better, mother, when I tell you their business.\" \"What is it?\" \"They are burglars.\" \"Burglars!\" repeated Mrs. Hoffman, turning suddenly pale and sinking back into a chair, for she had been standing. \"Yes, mother. They have found out, though I can\u0027t tell how, that there are some bonds and plate in the safe upstairs, and that is their reason for coming.\" \"How did you find out, Paul? What a dreadful thing!\" gasped Mrs. Hoffman. \"It will be worse for them than for us, I am thinking,\" said Paul. \"It was a boy told me—a boy that lives with them. I\u0027ll tell you about it.\" He gave his mother an account of what had already been communicated to him. \"Oh, dear, we shall be murdered in our beds!\" exclaimed his mother, in dismal accents. Upon this Jimmy began to cry, but Paul only laughed. \"I thought you were braver, Jimmy,\" he said. \"If I buy you a pistol, will you promise to use it?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Jimmy, dubiously. \"I should be afraid to shoot a great big man. Would he have a pistol, too?\" \"Probably.\" At this Jimmy began to cry again, and Paul hastened to say: \"Don\u0027t be afraid; I don\u0027t mean to have you sleep in the house that night.\" \"Where can we go?\" \"I think Mrs. Norton will let you stop with her that night.\" \"And you will come, too, Paul?\" said Mrs. Hoffman. \"And let the house be robbed, mother? What would Mr. Talbot think of that?\" \"But you will be killed. What can you do against such bad men?\" \"What would you recommend, mother?\" asked Paul. \"You might write a letter to them, telling them you knew all about their plan and you would have them arrested if they came.\" \"I don\u0027t think, mother,\" said Paul, laughing, \"that that would be the best course. I want to get them here and catch them. Then they can be shut up, and we shall be safe from any further attempts. I am going to police headquarters, and they will tell me what to do. Probably two or three officers will be concealed in the house, and when the burglars are fairly in will arrest them.\" \"You needn\u0027t stay, Paul.\" \"It is my duty, mother. We are left by Mr. Talbot in charge of the house and what it contains. Some of us ought to be here at such a time. I will take care not to get into danger.\" Mrs. Hoffman was a woman and a mother, and it was with difficulty that Paul could convince her that it was his duty to remain. At length, however, she acquiesced, and agreed to go and see Mrs. Norton the next day and ask permission to remain with her on Monday night. The next day Julius came to Paul\u0027s stand. \"Is there any news, Julius?\" asked Paul. \"Nothin\u0027 much,\" said Julius. \"Jack wants me to call up to your house and find out where the gold is kept.\" \"How does he think you are going to do it without my suspecting?\" \"He told me to go up and ask for some old clothes. Then, if you didn\u0027t let me into the house, I was to ask for something to eat.\" \"A good plan.\" said Paul. \"When are you coming?\" \"To-night.\" \"Very well; I\u0027ll be ready for you. Is there any change in the evening?\" \"No. They\u0027re comin\u0027 Monday night.\" \"I\u0027ll be ready for them,\" said Paul. \"What are you goin\u0027 to do?\" asked Julius, and he fixed a pair of sharp, black eyes on Paul. \"Can I trust you, Julius?\" demanded Paul, with a keen glance at the boy. \"Yes,\" said Julius. \"Then,\" said Paul, \"I mean to have them arrested. They\u0027ll walk into a trap.\" Julius looked thoughtful. \"Don\u0027t you like it, Julius?\" \"I dunno,\" said the boy, slowly. \"Do you like this man Morgan?\" \"I don\u0027t like him. I\u0027m used to him.\" \"And you don\u0027t like the idea of his being arrested through your means?\" Julius nodded. \"I know how you feel, but I don\u0027t see how it can be helped. If he didn\u0027t rob us he would rob somebody else. Did he ever do any honest work?\" \"Not as I knows on.\" \"How does he live?\" \"By stealin\u0027 and gamblin\u0027.\" \"I hope he won\u0027t teach you to follow his example, Julius.\" \"I don\u0027t want to be like him.\" \"Why not?\" \"I want to be respectable, like you.\" \"You know it\u0027s wrong to steal.\" \"Yes,\" said Julius, but without any great depth of conviction. The fact is, stealing was too familiar to his observation to excite in him detestation or horror. But he was a sharp boy. He knew that his guardian for the last five years had spent more than half the time in confinement. Even when free he lived from hand to mouth. Julius had made up his mind that it did not pay. He saw that an honest mechanic got a good deal more comfort and enjoyment out of life than Jack, and he had a vague wish to become respectable. This was encouraging, as far as it went. Higher considerations might come by and by. \"If you want to be respectable, Julius, I\u0027ll help you,\" said Paul. \"Will you?\" said Julius. \"Yes; you are doing me a great favor. I shall be in your debt, and that\u0027s the way I will pay you. You mustn\u0027t grow up like the man you live with.\" \"I don\u0027t want to.\" \"We\u0027ll talk about that after Monday. We shall have more time then.\" \"Shall I come up to-night, then?\" \"Yes, come.\" Julius strolled away with his blacking-box, and Paul was left to his reflections. \"He\u0027ll make a good boy if he\u0027s only encouraged,\" said Paul to himself. \"I don\u0027t know what would have become of me if I\u0027d been brought up by burglars like him. There\u0027s nothing like having a good mother. There ain\u0027t any excuse for a boy going wrong if he\u0027s got a good mother.\" Paul was right. Our destinies are decided more than we know by circumstances. If the street boys, brought up to a familiarity with poverty, and often with vice and crime, go astray, we should pity as well as condemn, and if we have it in our power to make the conditions of life more favorable for any, it is our duty, as the stewards of our common Father, to do what we can. It occurred to Paul that he had no old clothes to give Julius, all his wardrobe, not very extensive at the best, having been burned up in the fire which consumed his old home. As he had told Julius to come up, it was necessary that he should have something to give him, and he therefore decided to provide himself at a second-hand clothing store. He knew well enough where they were to be found. His old street companions used to go to Chatham street and Baxter street in search of clothing, and these localities, though not distinguished for fashion, are at least reasonable in their scale of prices. A little earlier than usual Paul closed his stand, and walked across the City Hall Park and up Chatham street to a store he had frequently seen. Like most of its class, it had a large portion of its stock displayed outside, where the proprietor stood, keen-eyed and watchful, on the lookout for customers. \"Can I sell you something this afternoon?\" he asked, obsequiously, as Paul halted in front of his store. \"That depends upon whether I see anything that suits me,\" answered Paul. Before he had finished, the dealer had seized his arm, and, hurrying him into the store, pulled down a coat, on the merits of which he began to expatiate with voluble tongue. \"I don\u0027t want anything for myself,\" said Paul. \"I want to buy a coat for a boy of twelve. Have you got anything of the right size?\" Paul need not have asked. The trader was keen at a sale, and if Barnum\u0027s giant had called for a second-hand suit, would have sworn boldly that he had the very thing. In the present case Paul found a coat which, as well as he could judge, would about fit Julius. At any rate, the street boy was not likely to be fastidious as to the quality or exact fit of a coat, which, at all events, would be a decided improvement upon the one he was now wearing. \"What is the price of this?\" asked Paul. \"Five dollars,\" was the reply. Paul was too well accustomed to the ways of Chatham street to pay the first price demanded, or the second or third. Finally he succeeded in getting the coat for one dollar and a half, which was cheap, although the dealer made a fair profit even at this price. Before the bargain was concluded, a tall man strayed in, and watched the bargaining with slight interest. Paul would have been not a little surprised had he known that this man was one of the burglars against whom he was contriving measures of defense. It was, indeed, Marlowe, who, having dexterously picked the pocket of a passenger on the Third avenue cars an hour before, found himself thirty dollars richer by the operation, and being himself out at elbows, had entered this shop on an errand similar to Paul\u0027s. \"What can I sell you?\" asked the shopkeeper, to his new customer. \"I want a coat,\" said Marlowe, roughly; \"good and cheap. Don\u0027t try any of your swindling tricks on me, for I won\u0027t stand them.\" With the details of the negotiation that followed we have nothing to do. It is enough to say that this chance meeting between Paul and Marlowe was not without its results, though neither knew the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82873.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
