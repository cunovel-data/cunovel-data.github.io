{"id":19168,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. A GIFT.","content":"The next forenoon Paul called at Mr. Preston\u0027s place of business. On entering the office he found Mr. Talbot conversing with him. \"Talbot,\" said Mr. Preston, \"this is your new tenant, Paul Hoffman.\" \"Good-morning, Paul,\" said Mr. Talbot pleasantly. \"Mrs. Talbot tells me that you and your mother called last evening.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I was called away by an engagement, but I am glad to say that Mrs. Talbot approves my choice.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"I hear from Mr. Preston that you have been unfortunate in being burned out.\" \"Yes, sir, we have been burned out, but we hadn\u0027t much to lose.\" \"Were you able to save any of your clothing?\" \"My mother saved a new dress she had just bought.\" \"Was that all?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"It will cost you considerable to replace what was destroyed.\" \"Considerable for me, sir. I called this morning to ask Mr. Preston for fifty dollars, from the money he has of mine, to spend for clothes for my mother, and brother, and myself.\" \"Will fifty dollars be sufficient?\" \"I have some money on hand. That will be all I shall need to draw.\" \"It will be a pity to disturb your savings. Your care of my house will be worth more than the rent. I will give you fifty dollars besides.\" Suiting the action to the word, Mr. Talbot took out his pocketbook and drew therefrom five ten-dollar bills, which he placed in Paul\u0027s hands. \"You are very kind,\" said Paul, in grateful surprise. \"We felt well paid by having our rent free.\" \"You are quite welcome, but I ought to tell you that it is to Mrs. Talbot you are indebted rather than to myself. She suggested my giving you the money, having been much pleased with your mother\u0027s appearance.\" \"I am very much obliged to her also, then,\" said Paul, \"and so will be my mother when I tell her. We will try to give you satisfaction.\" \"I feel sure you will,\" said Mr. Talbot kindly. \"That is a fine boy,\" he said, after Paul had bidden them good-morning and left the office. \"He is an excellent boy,\" said Mr. Preston warmly. \"He is straightforward, manly, and honest.\" \"How did you fall in with him?\" \"He fell in with me,\" said Mr. Preston, laughing. \"How is that?\" \"As I was turning the corner of a street downtown one day he ran into me and nearly knocked the breath out of me.\" \"Which prepossessed you in his favor?\" inquired Mr. Talbot, smiling. \"Not at first. However, it led to a little conversation, by which I learned that he was a street candy merchant, and that some young thief had run off with all his stock in trade. He was then in hot pursuit. Learning that his mother was a seamstress and a worthy woman, I employed her to make me some shirts. I have followed the fortunes of the family, and have been Paul\u0027s adviser since then, and latterly his banker. He is now proprietor of a street-stand, and making, for a boy of his age, quite a fair income.\" \"Your account interests me. If I am as well satisfied as I hope to be with the family I will hereafter seek out some way of serving him.\" \"I am certain you will be satisfied.\" The two gentlemen now conversed of other things, with which the reader has no concern. Paul went home in high spirits, and delighted his mother and Jimmy with the gift he had received. \"Now, mother,\" he said, \"get on your bonnet and shawl, and we\u0027ll go out shopping.\" \"Won\u0027t you take me too, Paul?\" asked Jimmy. \"To be sure I will. I am going to buy you a suit of clothes, Jimmy.\" The little boy clapped his hands. New clothes were a rarity to him, and the purchase of a new suit, therefore, would be a memorable event. I do not propose to detail Paul\u0027s purchases. They consisted of new suits for Jimmy and himself, and a complete outfit of under garments, closing with the purchase of two plain, substantial trunks. Mrs. Hoffman deferred her own shopping till Monday. When, later in the day, the various articles arrived, Paul regarded them with much complacency. \"It looks as if we were getting up in the world,\" he said. \"You deserve to succeed, Paul,\" said his mother. \"You have been industrious and faithful, and God has prospered you.\" \"I have had a good mother to encourage me,\" said Paul, \"or I should not have done so well.\" \"You are right to say that, Paul,\" said Mrs. Norton. \"It isn\u0027t every boy that has a good mother.\" \"That is true. There are some boys I know who would do well if their mothers were not shiftless and intemperate. You remember Tommy O\u0027Connor, mother, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, Paul.\" \"I met him in Nassau street yesterday. He was lounging about in rags, doing nothing. He asked me to lend him five cents. I asked him why he was not at work. He said his mother took all his money and spent it for drink. Then she got quarrelsome and beat him.\" \"How can any mother behave in that way?\" said Mrs. Hoffman, shuddering. \"I don\u0027t know, but there is more than one mother that does it, though it\u0027s more likely to be the father.\" The next day dawned bright and pleasant. \"Can I put on my new clothes, Paul?\" asked Jimmy. \"Yes,\" said Paul. \"It\u0027s Sunday, and we\u0027ll all put on our best clothes and go to church.\" \"I should like that,\" said the little boy, delighted. Mrs. Hoffman readily agreed to the plan. If of late the family had remained at home on Sunday, it was at first for want of good clothing, not from any want of respect for religious institutions. During Mr. Hoffman\u0027s life they had attended regularly, and Paul had belonged to a Sunday-school, Jimmy being too young. The church they had formerly attended being in Harlem, they could not of course go so far, but dropped into one not far from union Square. They were shown seats by the sexton, and listened attentively to the services, though it must be confessed that Jimmy\u0027s attention was occasionally diverted to his new clothes, of which he was not a little proud. Mrs. Hoffman felt glad once more to find herself enjoying religious privileges, and determined henceforth to attend regularly. As they were leaving the church, Paul suddenly found himself, to his surprise, next to Mr. and Mrs. Talbot, whom he had not before observed. \"Good-morning, Mr. Talbot,\" he said. Mr. Talbot turned on being addressed and said: \"What, Paul, are you here?\" \"Mr. Talbot, this is my mother,\" said Paul. \"Mrs. Hoffman,\" said Mr. Talbot, with as much courtesy as if he were addressing his social equal, \"I am glad to make your acquaintance. My dear, this is Mrs. Hoffman.\" Mrs. Talbot greeted both cordially, and made some inquiries about Jimmy. She observed with pleasure the neat appearance of the entire family, feeling sure that those who were so careful about their own appearance would be equally careful of her house. She also thought more favorably of them for their attendance at church, having herself a high respect for religious observances. Of course Paul and his mother thanked her in fitting terms for the gift which had enabled them to replace their losses by the fire. After a brief conversation they parted, Mr. and Mrs. Talbot going uptown, while Paul and his mother had nearly two miles to walk in a different direction. \"Next Sunday we shall be walking uptown also,\" said Paul. \"It will look well in the Directory, \u0027Paul Hoffman, merchant; house, Madison avenue,\u0027 won\u0027t it?\" \"Yes,\" said his mother, \"so long as it doesn\u0027t mention that you live in the basement.\" \"Some time I hope to occupy a whole house of my own.\" \"In Madison avenue?\" \"Perhaps so; who knows?\" \"I see, Paul, you are getting ambitious.\" \"Where shall I be, Paul?\" asked Jimmy, who felt that his future prospects deserved consideration. \"Oh, you\u0027ll be a famous artist, and have a studio on Fifth avenue.\" \"Do you think so, Paul?\" asked the little fellow seriously. \"I hope so. All you want is a little help from me now and then. If I had time I would give you a course of lessons in drawing.\" \"You draw awfully, Paul.\" \"Do you draw any better?\" \"Of course I do.\" \"Mother,\" said Paul, with much gravity, \"that boy\u0027s self-conceit is unbounded. You ought to talk to him about it.\" But though Paul liked to joke Jimmy, he had already decided, after they moved uptown, to give him an opportunity of developing his talent by engaging a drawing teacher for him. The large saving in their expenses from not being obliged to pay rent would allow him to do this easily. He had not yet mentioned this to Jimmy, for he meant to surprise him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82868.html","bookId":298,"book":{"id":298,"title":"Slow and Sure","description":"简介： I wonder how he will like my new picture, said Jimmy, a delicate boy of eight, whose refined features, thoughtful look, and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body.
