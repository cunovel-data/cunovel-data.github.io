{"id":42366,"no":44,"title":"THE FOX AND THE CAT","content":"It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to herself: \u0027He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world,\u0027 she spoke to him in a friendly way. \u0027Good day, dear Mr Fox, how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard times?\u0027 The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not. At last he said: \u0027Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How many arts do you understand?\u0027 \u0027I understand but one,\u0027 replied the cat, modestly. \u0027What art is that?\u0027 asked the fox. \u0027When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.\u0027 \u0027Is that all?\u0027 said the fox. \u0027I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will teach you how people get away from the hounds.\u0027 Just then came a hunter with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. \u0027Open your sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,\u0027 cried the cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast. \u0027Ah, Mr Fox,\u0027 cried the cat. \u0027You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1520/45351.html","bookId":659,"book":{"id":659,"title":"Grimms\u0027 Fairy Tales","description":"简介： A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples.
