{"id":42351,"no":29,"title":"FREDERICK AND CATHERINE","content":"There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said. \u0027Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.\u0027 \u0027Very well,\u0027 said she, \u0027it shall all be ready.\u0027 When dinner-time drew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she said to herself, \u0027The steak is almost ready, I may as well go to the cellar for the ale.\u0027 So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her head, \u0027The dog is not shut up—he may be running away with the steak; that\u0027s well thought of.\u0027 So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with it. Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. \u0027It\u0027s all gone, and \"what can\u0027t be cured must be endured\",\u0027 said Catherine. So she turned round; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to cool herself. Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had happened. \u0027My stars!\u0027 said she, \u0027what shall I do to keep Frederick from seeing all this slopping about?\u0027 So she thought a while; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair, and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale nicely. \u0027What a lucky thing,\u0027 said she, \u0027that we kept that meal! we have now a good use for it.\u0027 So away she went for it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. \u0027Ah! well,\u0027 said she, \u0027when one goes another may as well follow.\u0027 Then she strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said, \u0027How very neat and clean it looks!\u0027 At noon Frederick came home. \u0027Now, wife,\u0027 cried he, \u0027what have you for dinner?\u0027 \u0027O Frederick!\u0027 answered she, \u0027I was cooking you a steak; but while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!\u0027 \u0027Kate, Kate,\u0027 said he, \u0027how could you do all this?\u0027 Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?\u0027 \u0027Why, Frederick,\u0027 said she, \u0027I did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.\u0027 The husband thought to himself, \u0027If my wife manages matters thus, I must look sharp myself.\u0027 Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he said to Catherine, \u0027What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go near or meddle with them.\u0027 \u0027No, Frederick,\u0027 said she, \u0027that I never will.\u0027 As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy. \u0027Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.\u0027 \u0027Yellow buttons!\u0027 said they: \u0027let us have a look at them.\u0027 \u0027Go into the garden and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare not go myself.\u0027 So the rogues went: and when they found what these yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out, \u0027Kate, what have you been doing?\u0027 \u0027See,\u0027 said she, \u0027I have bought all these with your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves and dug them up.\u0027 \u0027Wife, wife,\u0027 said Frederick, \u0027what a pretty piece of work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you to do such a thing?\u0027 \u0027Why,\u0027 answered she, \u0027I did not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me.\u0027 Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband, \u0027Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after the thieves.\u0027 \u0027Well, we will try,\u0027 answered he; \u0027but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.\u0027 \u0027Very well,\u0027 said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the fastest, he left his wife some way behind. \u0027It does not matter,\u0027 thought she: \u0027when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.\u0027 Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side as they passed. \u0027Ah, see now,\u0027 said she, \u0027how they have bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.\u0027 So she took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she said, \u0027Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he has younger legs than I have.\u0027 Then she rolled the other cheese after it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she could not stay there all day waiting for them. At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. \u0027Where are the butter and cheese?\u0027 said he. \u0027Oh!\u0027 answered she, \u0027I used the butter to grease those poor trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on the road together somewhere.\u0027 \u0027What a goose you are to do such silly things!\u0027 said the husband. \u0027How can you say so?\u0027 said she; \u0027I am sure you never told me not.\u0027 They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, \u0027Kate, I hope you locked the door safe when you came away.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 answered she, \u0027you did not tell me.\u0027 \u0027Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,\u0027 said Frederick, \u0027and bring with you something to eat.\u0027 Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way, \u0027Frederick wants something to eat; but I don\u0027t think he is very fond of butter and cheese: I\u0027ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar, for I have often seen him take some.\u0027 When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she took off the hinges, and said, \u0027Frederick told me to lock the door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.\u0027 So she took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out, \u0027There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as carefully as you please.\u0027 \u0027Alas! alas!\u0027 said he, \u0027what a clever wife I have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so that everybody may go in and out as they please—however, as you have brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.\u0027 \u0027Very well,\u0027 answered she, \u0027I\u0027ll carry the door; but I\u0027ll not carry the nuts and vinegar bottle also—that would be too much of a load; so if you please, I\u0027ll fasten them to the door.\u0027 Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there. Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired; so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said, \u0027It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down.\u0027 Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired; but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said softly, \u0027Frederick, I must let the nuts go.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 answered he, \u0027not now, they will discover us.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t help that: they must go.\u0027 \u0027Well, then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.\u0027 Then away rattled the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, \u0027Bless me, it is hailing.\u0027 A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy: so she whispered to Frederick, \u0027I must throw the vinegar down.\u0027 \u0027Pray don\u0027t,\u0027 answered he, \u0027it will discover us.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t help that,\u0027 said she, \u0027go it must.\u0027 So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves said, \u0027What a heavy dew there is!\u0027 At last it popped into Catherine\u0027s head that it was the door itself that was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, \u0027Frederick, I must throw the door down soon.\u0027 But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he was sure it would betray them. \u0027Here goes, however,\u0027 said she: and down went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried out \u0027Murder!\u0027 and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there they found all their money safe and sound.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1520/45336.html","bookId":659,"book":{"id":659,"title":"Grimms\u0027 Fairy Tales","description":"简介： A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples.
