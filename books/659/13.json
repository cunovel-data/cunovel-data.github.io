{"id":42335,"no":13,"title":"CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP","content":"A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. \u0027But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger,\u0027 said the cat; \u0027and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.\u0027 The good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: \u0027I know no place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it.\u0027 So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: \u0027I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 answered the mouse, \u0027by all means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.\u0027 All this, however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home. \u0027Well, here you are again,\u0027 said the mouse, \u0027no doubt you have had a merry day.\u0027 \u0027All went off well,\u0027 answered the cat. \u0027What name did they give the child?\u0027 \u0027Top off!\u0027 said the cat quite coolly. \u0027Top off!\u0027 cried the mouse, \u0027that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?\u0027 \u0027What does that matter,\u0027 said the cat, \u0027it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to the mouse: \u0027You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.\u0027 The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. \u0027Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,\u0027 said she, and was quite satisfied with her day\u0027s work. When she went home the mouse inquired: \u0027And what was the child christened?\u0027 \u0027Half-done,\u0027 answered the cat. \u0027Half-done! What are you saying? I never heard the name in my life, I\u0027ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The cat\u0027s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. \u0027All good things go in threes,\u0027 said she, \u0027I am asked to stand godmother again. The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only happens once every few years, you will let me go, won\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Top-off! Half-done!\u0027 answered the mouse, \u0027they are such odd names, they make me very thoughtful.\u0027 \u0027You sit at home,\u0027 said the cat, \u0027in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that\u0027s because you do not go out in the daytime.\u0027 During the cat\u0027s absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat. \u0027When everything is eaten up one has some peace,\u0027 said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child. \u0027It will not please you more than the others,\u0027 said the cat. \u0027He is called All-gone.\u0027 \u0027All-gone,\u0027 cried the mouse \u0027that is the most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone; what can that mean?\u0027 and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: \u0027Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves—we shall enjoy that.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 answered the cat, \u0027you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.\u0027 They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. \u0027Alas!\u0027 said the mouse, \u0027now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First top off, then half-done, then—\u0027 \u0027Will you hold your tongue,\u0027 cried the cat, \u0027one word more, and I will eat you too.\u0027 \u0027All-gone\u0027 was already on the poor mouse\u0027s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of the world. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1520/45320.html","bookId":659,"book":{"id":659,"title":"Grimms\u0027 Fairy Tales","description":"简介： A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples.
