{"id":42330,"no":8,"title":"THE DOG AND THE SPARROW","content":"A shepherd\u0027s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, \u0027Why are you so sad, my friend?\u0027 \u0027Because,\u0027 said the dog, \u0027I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.\u0027 \u0027If that be all,\u0027 answered the sparrow, \u0027come with me into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.\u0027 So on they went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher\u0027s shop, the sparrow said to the dog, \u0027Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat.\u0027 So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. \u0027Well,\u0027 said the sparrow, \u0027you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.\u0027 When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, \u0027Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?\u0027 \u0027I have had plenty of meat,\u0027 answered he, \u0027but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.\u0027 \u0027Come with me then,\u0027 said the sparrow, \u0027and you shall soon have that too.\u0027 So she took him to a baker\u0027s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said he; \u0027and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.\u0027 So they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone far before the dog said, \u0027I am very much tired—I should like to take a nap.\u0027 \u0027Very well,\u0027 answered the sparrow, \u0027do so, and in the meantime I will perch upon that bush.\u0027 So the dog stretched himself out on the road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called out, \u0027Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.\u0027 But the carter, grumbling to himself, \u0027You make it the worse for me, indeed! what can you do?\u0027 cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. \u0027There,\u0027 cried the sparrow, \u0027thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.\u0027 \u0027Do your worst, and welcome,\u0027 said the brute, \u0027what harm can you do me?\u0027 and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty. \u0027What an unlucky wretch I am!\u0027 cried he. \u0027Not wretch enough yet!\u0027 said the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse\u0027s head with such force, that he fell down dead. \u0027Unlucky wretch that I am!\u0027 cried he. \u0027Not wretch enough yet!\u0027 said the sparrow. And as the carter went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, \u0027Miserable wretch that I am!\u0027 But the sparrow answered, \u0027Not wretch enough yet!\u0027 and perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the spot. \u0027Unlucky wretch that I am!\u0027 said he. \u0027Not wretch enough yet!\u0027 said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two. \u0027Alas! miserable wretch that I am!\u0027 cried he. \u0027Not wretch enough yet!\u0027 answered the sparrow as she flew away; \u0027now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.\u0027 The carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation. \u0027Alas!\u0027 said he to his wife, \u0027what ill luck has befallen me!—my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three dead.\u0027 \u0027Alas! husband,\u0027 replied she, \u0027and a wicked bird has come into the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it up at such a rate!\u0027 Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the midst of them. \u0027Unlucky wretch that I am!\u0027 cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was almost all gone. \u0027Not wretch enough yet!\u0027 said the sparrow; \u0027thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!\u0027 and away she flew. \\n\\n \\n\\n The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat on the outside of the window, and cried \u0027Carter! thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life!\u0027 With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and cried, \u0027Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!\u0027 Then he became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the wife said, \u0027Shall I kill her at once?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 cried he, \u0027that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat her.\u0027 But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck and cried, \u0027Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!\u0027 With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, \u0027Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.\u0027 And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1520/45315.html","bookId":659,"book":{"id":659,"title":"Grimms\u0027 Fairy Tales","description":"简介： A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples.
