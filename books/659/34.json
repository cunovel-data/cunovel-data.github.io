{"id":42356,"no":34,"title":"THE MISER IN THE BUSH","content":"A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came into the man\u0027s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master, and said, \u0027I have worked hard for you a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble.\u0027 The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year\u0027s service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have, and said to himself, \u0027Why should I work hard, and live here on bad fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself merry.\u0027 With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming over hill and valley. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry. \u0027Why, what should make me down-hearted?\u0027 said he; \u0027I am sound in health and rich in purse, what should I care for? I have saved up my three years\u0027 earnings and have it all safe in my pocket.\u0027 \u0027How much may it come to?\u0027 said the little man. \u0027Full threepence,\u0027 replied the countryman. \u0027I wish you would give them to me,\u0027 said the other; \u0027I am very poor.\u0027 Then the man pitied him, and gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, \u0027As you have such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes—one for every penny; so choose whatever you like.\u0027 Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, \u0027I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.\u0027 The dwarf said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went his way. \\n\\n \\n\\n Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush singing away most joyfully. \u0027Oh, what a pretty bird!\u0027 said the miser; \u0027I would give a great deal of money to have such a one.\u0027 \u0027If that\u0027s all,\u0027 said the countryman, \u0027I will soon bring it down.\u0027 Then he took up his bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree. The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down. \u0027Oh, for heaven\u0027s sake!\u0027 cried the miser, \u0027Master! master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?\u0027 \u0027Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,\u0027 said the other; \u0027thou art only meeting thy reward\u0027: so he played up another tune. Then the miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to the musician\u0027s price for some time, and he danced him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse, and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman saw so much money, he said, \u0027I will agree to your proposal.\u0027 So he took the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his bargain. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and brought up to be tried. \\n\\n \\n\\n The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his money. \u0027No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.\u0027 said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows. \\n\\n \\n\\n So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, \u0027My Lord Judge, grant me one last request.\u0027 \u0027Anything but thy life,\u0027 replied the other. \u0027No,\u0027 said he, \u0027I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon my fiddle for the last time.\u0027 The miser cried out, \u0027Oh, no! no! for heaven\u0027s sake don\u0027t listen to him! don\u0027t listen to him!\u0027 But the judge said, \u0027It is only this once, he will soon have done.\u0027 The fact was, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf\u0027s third gift. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the miser said, \u0027Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity\u0027s sake.\u0027 But the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together—judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him the hundred florins. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he called to the miser, and said, \u0027Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,\u0027 \u0027I stole it,\u0027 said the miser in the presence of all the people; \u0027I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.\u0027 Then the countryman stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1520/45341.html","bookId":659,"book":{"id":659,"title":"Grimms\u0027 Fairy Tales","description":"简介： A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples.
