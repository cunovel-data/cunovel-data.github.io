{"id":42378,"no":56,"title":"THE WEDDING OF MRS FOX","content":"FIRST STORY There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it became known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves. The maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said: \u0027What may you be about, Miss Cat? Do you sleep or do you wake?\u0027 She answered: \u0027I am not sleeping, I am waking, Would you know what I am making? I am boiling warm beer with butter, Will you be my guest for supper?\u0027 \u0027No, thank you, miss,\u0027 said the fox, \u0027what is Mrs Fox doing?\u0027 The maid replied: \u0027She is sitting in her room, Moaning in her gloom, Weeping her little eyes quite red, Because old Mr Fox is dead.\u0027 \u0027Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her.\u0027 \u0027Certainly, young sir.\u0027 The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap, The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap, \u0027Mistress Fox, are you inside?\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes, my little cat,\u0027 she cried. \u0027A wooer he stands at the door out there.\u0027 \u0027What does he look like, my dear?\u0027 \u0027Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?\u0027 \u0027Oh, no,\u0027 answered the cat, \u0027he has only one.\u0027 \u0027Then I will not have him.\u0027 Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat: \u0027Now open the gates and doors all wide, And carry old Mr Fox outside.\u0027 But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs Fox out of the house. SECOND STORY When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The wolf greeted her, and said: \u0027Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit, How comes it that alone you sit? What are you making good?\u0027 The cat replied: \u0027In milk I\u0027m breaking bread so sweet, Will you be my guest, and eat?\u0027 \u0027No, thank you, Mrs Cat,\u0027 answered the wolf. \u0027Is Mrs Fox not at home?\u0027 The cat said: \u0027She sits upstairs in her room, Bewailing her sorrowful doom, Bewailing her trouble so sore, For old Mr Fox is no more.\u0027 The wolf answered: \u0027If she\u0027s in want of a husband now, Then will it please her to step below?\u0027 The cat runs quickly up the stair, And lets her tail fly here and there, Until she comes to the parlour door. With her five gold rings at the door she knocks: \u0027Are you within, good Mistress Fox? If you\u0027re in want of a husband now, Then will it please you to step below? Mrs Fox asked: \u0027Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed mouth?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 answered the cat. \u0027Then he won\u0027t do for me.\u0027 When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young fox. Then Mrs Fox said: \u0027Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a little pointed mouth?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the cat, \u0027he has.\u0027 \u0027Then let him come upstairs,\u0027 said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast. \u0027Sweep me the room as clean as you can, Up with the window, fling out my old man! For many a fine fat mouse he brought, Yet of his wife he never thought, But ate up every one he caught.\u0027 Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1520/45363.html","bookId":659,"book":{"id":659,"title":"Grimms\u0027 Fairy Tales","description":"简介： A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples.
