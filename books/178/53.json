{"id":5485,"no":53,"title":"Chapter 53","content":"53:1 [hgb] 我 们 所 传 的 ， （ 或 作 所 传 与 我 们 的 ） 有 谁 信 呢 ？ 耶 和 华 的 膀 臂 向 谁 显 露 呢 ？ [kjv] Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? [bbe] Who would have had faith in the word which has come to our ears, and to whom had the arm of the Lord been unveiled? 53:2 [hgb] 他 在 耶 和 华 面 前 生 长 如 嫩 芽 ， 像 根 出 于 干 地 。 他 无 佳 形 美 容 ， 我 们 看 见 他 的 时 候 ， 也 无 美 貌 使 我 们 羡 慕 他 。 [kjv] For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. [bbe] For his growth was like that of a delicate plant before him, and like a root out of a dry place: he had no grace of form, to give us pleasure; 53:3 [hgb] 他 被 藐 视 ， 被 人 厌 弃 ， 多 受 痛 苦 ， 常 经 忧 患 。 他 被 藐 视 ， 好 像 被 人 掩 面 不 看 的 一 样 。 我 们 也 不 尊 重 他 。 [kjv] He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. [bbe] Men made sport of him, turning away from him; he was a man of sorrows, marked by disease; and like one from whom men\u0027s faces are turned away, he was looked down on, and we put no value on him. 53:4 [hgb] 他 诚 然 担 当 我 们 的 忧 患 ， 背 负 我 们 的 痛 苦 。 我 们 却 以 为 他 受 责 罚 ， 被 神 击 打 苦 待 了 。 [kjv] Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. [bbe] But it was our pain he took, and our diseases were put on him: while to us he seemed as one diseased, on whom God\u0027s punishment had come. 53:5 [hgb] 哪 知 他 为 我 们 的 过 犯 受 害 ， 为 我 们 的 罪 孽 压 伤 。 因 他 受 的 刑 罚 我 们 得 平 安 。 因 他 受 的 鞭 伤 我 们 得 医 治 。 [kjv] But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. [bbe] But it was for our sins he was wounded, and for our evil doings he was crushed: he took the punishment by which we have peace, and by his wounds we are made well. 53:6 [hgb] 我 们 都 如 羊 走 迷 ， 各 人 偏 行 己 路 。 耶 和 华 使 我 们 众 人 的 罪 孽 都 归 在 他 身 上 。 [kjv] All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. [bbe] We all went wandering like sheep; going every one of us after his desire; and the Lord put on him the punishment of us all. 53:7 [hgb] 他 被 欺 压 ， 在 受 苦 的 时 候 却 不 开 口 。 （ 或 作 他 受 欺 压 却 自 卑 不 开 口 ） 他 像 羊 羔 被 牵 到 宰 杀 之 地 ， 又 像 羊 在 剪 毛 的 人 手 下 无 声 ， 他 也 是 这 样 不 开 口 。 [kjv] He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. [bbe] Men were cruel to him, but he was gentle and quiet; as a lamb taken to its death, and as a sheep before those who take her wool makes no sound, so he said not a word. 53:8 [hgb] 因 受 欺 压 和 审 判 他 被 夺 去 。 至 于 他 同 世 的 人 ， 谁 想 他 受 鞭 打 ， 从 活 人 之 地 被 剪 除 ， 是 因 我 百 姓 的 罪 过 呢 ？ [kjv] He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. [bbe] They took away from him help and right, and who gave a thought to his fate? for he was cut off from the land of the living: he came to his death for the sin of my people. 53:9 [hgb] 他 虽 然 未 行 强 暴 ， 口 中 也 没 有 诡 诈 ， 人 还 使 他 与 恶 人 同 埋 。 谁 知 死 的 时 候 与 财 主 同 葬 。 [kjv] And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. [bbe] And they put his body into the earth with sinners, and his last resting-place was with the evil-doers, though he had done no wrong, and no deceit was in his mouth. 53:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 却 定 意 （ 或 作 喜 悦 ） 将 他 压 伤 ， 使 他 受 痛 苦 。 耶 和 华 以 他 为 赎 罪 祭 。 （ 或 作 他 献 本 身 为 赎 罪 祭 ） 他 必 看 见 后 裔 ， 并 且 延 长 年 日 ， 耶 和 华 所 喜 悦 的 事 ， 必 在 他 手 中 亨 通 。 [kjv] Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. [bbe] And the Lord was pleased ... see a seed, long life, ... will do well in his hand. ... 53:11 [hgb] 他 必 看 见 自 己 劳 苦 的 功 效 ， 便 心 满 意 足 。 有 许 多 人 ， 因 认 识 我 的 义 仆 得 称 为 义 。 并 且 他 要 担 当 他 们 的 罪 孽 。 [kjv] He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. [bbe] ... made clear his righteousness before men ... had taken their sins on himself. 53:12 [hgb] 所 以 我 要 使 他 与 位 大 的 同 分 ， 与 强 盛 的 均 分 掳 物 。 因 为 他 将 命 倾 倒 ， 以 致 于 死 。 他 也 被 列 在 罪 犯 之 中 。 他 却 担 当 多 人 的 罪 ， 又 为 罪 犯 代 求 。 [kjv] Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. [bbe] For this cause he will have a heritage with the great, and he will have a part in the goods of war with the strong, because he gave up his life, and was numbered with the evil-doers; taking on himself the sins of the people, and making prayer for the wrongdoers.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1898.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
