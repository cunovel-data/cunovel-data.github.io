{"id":5461,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"29:1 [hgb] 唉 ， 亚 利 伊 勒 ， 亚 利 伊 勒 ， 大 卫 安 营 的 城 。 任 凭 你 年 上 加 年 ， 节 期 照 常 周 流 。 [kjv] Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices. [bbe] Ho! Ariel, Ariel, the town against which David made war; put year to year, let the feasts come round: 29:2 [hgb] 我 终 必 使 亚 利 伊 勒 困 难 。 他 必 悲 伤 哀 号 ， 我 却 仍 以 他 为 亚 利 伊 勒 。 [kjv] Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel. [bbe] And I will send trouble on Ariel, and there will be weeping and cries of grief; and she will be to me as Ariel. 29:3 [hgb] 我 必 四 围 安 营 攻 击 你 ， 屯 兵 围 困 你 ， 筑 垒 攻 击 你 。 [kjv] And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee. [bbe] And I will make war on you like David, and you will be shut in by earthworks, and I will make towers round you. 29:4 [hgb] 你 必 败 落 ， 从 地 中 说 话 。 你 的 言 语 必 微 细 出 于 尘 埃 。 你 的 声 音 必 像 那 交 鬼 者 的 声 音 出 于 地 。 你 的 言 语 低 低 微 微 出 于 尘 埃 。 [kjv] And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust. [bbe] And you will be made low, and your voice will come out of the earth, and your words will be low out of the dust; and your voice will come out of the earth like that of a spirit, making bird-like noises out of the dust. 29:5 [hgb] 你 仇 敌 的 群 众 ， 却 要 像 细 尘 ， 强 暴 人 的 群 众 ， 也 要 像 飞 糠 。 这 事 必 顷 刻 之 间 忽 然 临 到 。 [kjv] Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly. [bbe] And the army of your attackers will be like small dust, and all the cruel ones like dry stems gone before the wind; suddenly it will come about. 29:6 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 必 用 雷 轰 ， 地 震 ， 大 声 ， 旋 风 ， 暴 风 ， 并 吞 灭 的 火 焰 ， 向 他 讨 罪 。 [kjv] Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire. [bbe] The Lord of armies will come in with thunder and earth-shaking and great noise, with rushing wind and storm, and the flame of burning fire. 29:7 [hgb] 那 时 ， 攻 击 亚 利 伊 勒 列 国 的 群 众 ， 就 是 一 切 攻 击 亚 利 伊 勒 和 他 的 保 障 ， 并 使 他 困 难 的 ， 必 如 梦 景 ， 如 夜 间 的 异 象 。 [kjv] And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision. [bbe] And all the nations making war on Ariel, and all those who are fighting against her and shutting her in with their towers, will be like a dream, like a vision of the night. 29:8 [hgb] 又 必 像 饥 饿 的 人 ， 梦 中 吃 饭 ， 醒 了 仍 觉 腹 空 。 或 像 口 渴 的 人 ， 梦 中 喝 水 ， 醒 了 仍 觉 发 昏 ， 心 里 想 喝 。 攻 击 锡 安 山 列 国 的 群 众 ， 也 必 如 此 。 [kjv] It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion. [bbe] And it will be like a man desiring food, and dreaming that he is feasting; but when he is awake there is nothing in his mouth: or like a man in need of water, dreaming that he is drinking; but when he is awake he is feeble and his soul is full of desire: so will all the nations be which make war on Mount Zion. 29:9 [hgb] 你 们 等 候 惊 奇 吧 。 你 们 宴 乐 昏 迷 吧 。 他 们 醉 了 ， 却 非 因 酒 。 他 们 东 倒 西 歪 ， 却 非 因 浓 酒 。 [kjv] Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. [bbe] Be surprised and full of wonder; let your eyes be covered and be blind: be overcome, but not with wine; go with uncertain steps, but not because of strong drink. 29:10 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 将 沉 睡 的 灵 ， 浇 灌 你 们 ， 封 闭 你 们 的 眼 ， 蒙 盖 你 们 的 头 。 你 们 的 眼 ， 就 是 先 知 。 你 们 的 头 ， 就 是 先 见 。 [kjv] For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. [bbe] For the Lord has sent on you a spirit of deep sleep; and by him your eyes, the prophets, are shut, and your heads, the seers, are covered. 29:11 [hgb] 所 有 的 默 示 你 们 看 如 封 住 的 书 卷 。 人 将 这 书 卷 交 给 识 字 的 ， 说 ， 请 念 吧 。 他 说 ， 我 不 能 念 ， 因 为 是 封 住 了 。 [kjv] And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: [bbe] And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book which is shut, which men give to one who has knowledge of writing, saying, Make clear to us what is in the book: and he says, I am not able to, for the book is shut: 29:12 [hgb] 又 将 这 书 卷 交 给 不 识 字 的 人 ， 说 ， 请 念 吧 。 他 说 ， 我 不 识 字 。 [kjv] And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. [bbe] And they give it to one without learning, saying, Make clear to us what is in the book: and he says, I have no knowledge of writing. 29:13 [hgb] 主 说 ， 因 为 这 百 姓 亲 近 我 ， 用 嘴 唇 尊 敬 我 ， 心 却 远 离 我 。 他 们 敬 畏 我 ， 不 过 是 领 受 人 的 吩 咐 。 [kjv] Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: [bbe] And the Lord said, because this people come near to me with their mouths, and give honour to me with their lips, but their heart is far from me, and their fear of me is false, a rule given them by the teaching of men; 29:14 [hgb] 所 以 我 在 这 百 姓 中 要 行 奇 妙 的 事 ， 就 是 奇 妙 又 奇 妙 的 事 。 他 们 智 慧 人 的 智 慧 ， 必 然 消 灭 ， 聪 明 人 的 聪 明 ， 必 然 隐 藏 。 [kjv] Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. [bbe] For this cause I will again do a strange thing among this people, a thing to be wondered at: and the wisdom of their wise men will come to nothing, and the sense of their guides will no longer be seen. 29:15 [hgb] 祸 哉 ， 那 些 向 耶 和 华 深 藏 谋 略 的 ， 又 在 暗 中 行 事 ， 说 ， 谁 看 见 我 们 呢 ？ 谁 知 道 我 们 呢 ？ [kjv] Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? [bbe] Cursed are those who go deep to keep their designs secret from the Lord, and whose works are in the dark, and who say, Who sees us? and who has knowledge of our acts? 29:16 [hgb] 你 们 把 事 颠 倒 了 ， 岂 可 看 窑 匠 如 泥 吗 ？ 被 制 作 的 物 ， 岂 可 论 制 作 物 的 说 ， 他 没 有 制 作 我 。 或 是 被 创 造 的 物 论 造 物 的 说 ， 他 没 有 聪 明 ？ [kjv] Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter\u0027s clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding? [bbe] You are turning things upside down! Is the wet earth the same to you as the one who is forming it? will the thing made say of him who made it, He made me not: or the thing formed say of him who gave it form, He has no knowledge? 29:17 [hgb] 利 巴 嫩 变 为 肥 田 ， 肥 田 看 如 树 林 ， 不 是 只 有 一 点 点 时 候 吗 ？ [kjv] Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? [bbe] In a very short time Lebanon will become a fertile field, and the fertile field will seem like a wood. 29:18 [hgb] 那 时 ， 聋 子 必 听 见 这 书 上 的 话 。 瞎 子 的 眼 ， 必 从 迷 蒙 黑 暗 中 得 以 看 见 。 [kjv] And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. [bbe] And in that day those whose ears are stopped will be hearing the words of the book; and the eyes of the blind will see through the mist and the dark. 29:19 [hgb] 谦 卑 人 ， 必 因 耶 和 华 增 添 欢 喜 。 人 间 贫 穷 的 ， 必 因 以 色 列 的 圣 者 快 乐 。 [kjv] The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. [bbe] And the poor will have their joy in the Lord increased, and those in need will be glad in the Holy One of Israel. 29:20 [hgb] 因 为 强 暴 人 已 归 无 有 。 亵 慢 人 已 经 灭 绝 。 一 切 找 机 会 作 孽 的 ， 都 被 剪 除 。 [kjv] For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: [bbe] For the cruel one has come to nothing; and those who make sport of the Lord are gone; and those who are watching to do evil are cut off: 29:21 [hgb] 他 们 在 争 讼 的 事 上 ， 定 无 罪 的 为 有 罪 ， 为 城 门 口 责 备 人 的 ， 设 下 网 罗 ， 用 虚 无 的 事 ， 屈 枉 义 人 。 [kjv] That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought. [bbe] Who give help to a man in a wrong cause, and who put a net for the feet of him who gives decisions in the public place, taking away a man\u0027s right without cause. 29:22 [hgb] 所 以 救 赎 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 耶 和 华 ， 论 雅 各 家 如 此 说 ， 雅 各 必 不 再 羞 愧 ， 面 容 也 不 至 变 色 。 [kjv] Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. [bbe] For this reason the Lord, the saviour of Abraham, says about the family of Jacob, Jacob will not now be put to shame, or his face be clouded with fear. 29:23 [hgb] 但 他 看 见 他 的 众 子 ， 就 是 我 手 的 工 作 ， 在 他 那 里 ， 他 们 必 尊 我 的 名 为 圣 ， 必 尊 雅 各 的 圣 者 为 圣 ， 必 敬 畏 以 色 列 的 神 。 [kjv] But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. [bbe] But when they, the children of Jacob, see the work of my hands among them, they will give honour to my name; yes, they will give honour to the Holy One of Jacob, and go in fear of the God of Israel. 29:24 [hgb] 心 中 迷 糊 的 ， 必 得 明 白 ， 发 怨 言 的 ， 必 受 训 诲 。 [kjv] They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine. [bbe] Those whose hearts were turned away from him will get knowledge, and those who made an outcry against him will give attention to his teaching.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1874.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
