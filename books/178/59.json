{"id":5491,"no":59,"title":"Chapter 59","content":"59:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 膀 臂 ， 并 非 缩 短 不 能 拯 救 。 耳 朵 ， 并 非 发 沉 不 能 听 见 。 \n [kjv] Behold, the LORD\u0027s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: \n [bbe] Truly, the Lord\u0027s hand has not become short, so that he is unable to give salvation; and his ear is not shut from hearing: \n 59:2 [hgb] 但 你 们 的 罪 孽 使 你 们 与 神 隔 绝 ， 你 们 的 罪 恶 使 他 掩 面 不 听 你 们 。 \n [kjv] But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. \n [bbe] But your sins have come between you and your God, and by your evil doings his face has been veiled from you, so that he will give you no answer. \n 59:3 [hgb] 因 你 们 的 手 被 血 沾 染 ， 你 们 的 指 头 被 罪 孽 沾 污 。 你 们 的 嘴 唇 说 谎 言 ， 你 们 的 舌 头 出 恶 语 。 \n [kjv] For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. \n [bbe] For your hands are unclean with blood, and your fingers with sin; your lips have said false things, and your tongue gives out deceit. \n 59:4 [hgb] 无 一 人 按 公 义 告 状 ， 无 一 人 凭 诚 实 辨 白 。 都 倚 靠 虚 妄 ， 说 谎 言 。 所 怀 的 是 毒 害 ， 所 生 的 是 罪 孽 。 \n [kjv] None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. \n [bbe] No one puts forward an upright cause, or gives a true decision: their hope is in deceit, and their words are false; they are with child with sin, and give birth to evil. \n 59:5 [hgb] 他 们 抱 毒 蛇 蛋 ， 结 蜘 蛛 网 。 人 吃 这 蛋 必 死 。 这 蛋 被 踏 ， 必 出 蝮 蛇 。 \n [kjv] They hatch cockatrice\u0027 eggs, and weave the spider\u0027s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. \n [bbe] They give birth to snake\u0027s eggs, and make spider\u0027s threads: whoever takes their eggs for food comes to his death, and the egg which is crushed becomes a poison-snake. \n 59:6 [hgb] 所 结 的 网 ， 不 能 成 为 衣 服 ， 所 作 的 ， 也 不 能 遮 盖 自 己 。 他 们 的 行 为 都 是 罪 孽 ， 手 所 作 的 都 是 强 暴 。 \n [kjv] Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. \n [bbe] Their twisted threads will not make clothing, and their works will give them nothing for covering themselves: their works are works of sin, and violent acts are in their hands. \n 59:7 [hgb] 他 们 的 脚 奔 跑 行 恶 ， 他 们 急 速 流 无 辜 人 的 血 。 意 念 都 是 罪 孽 。 所 经 过 的 路 都 荒 凉 毁 灭 。 \n [kjv] Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths. \n [bbe] Their feet go quickly to evil, and they take delight in the death of the upright; their thoughts are thoughts of sin; wasting and destruction are in their ways. \n 59:8 [hgb] 平 安 的 路 ， 他 们 不 知 道 。 所 行 的 事 没 有 公 平 。 他 们 为 自 己 修 弯 曲 的 路 。 凡 行 此 路 的 ， 都 不 知 道 平 安 。 \n [kjv] The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace. \n [bbe] They have no knowledge of the way of peace, and there is no sense of what is right in their behaviour: they have made for themselves ways which are not straight; whoever goes in them has no knowledge of peace. \n 59:9 [hgb] 因 此 公 平 离 我 们 远 ， 公 义 追 不 上 我 们 。 我 们 指 望 光 亮 ， 却 是 黑 暗 。 指 望 光 明 ， 却 行 幽 暗 。 \n [kjv] Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness. \n [bbe] For this cause our right is far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us: we are looking for light, but there is only the dark; for the shining of the sun, but our way is in the night. \n 59:10 [hgb] 我 们 摸 索 墙 壁 ， 好 像 瞎 子 。 我 们 摸 索 如 同 无 目 之 人 。 我 们 晌 午 绊 脚 ， 如 在 黄 昏 一 样 。 我 们 在 肥 壮 人 中 ， 像 死 人 一 般 。 \n [kjv] We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men. \n [bbe] We go on our way, like blind men feeling for the wall, even like those who have no eyes: we are running against things in daylight as if it was evening; our place is in the dark like dead men. \n 59:11 [hgb] 我 们 咆 哮 如 熊 ， 哀 鸣 如 鸽 。 指 望 公 平 ， 却 是 没 有 。 指 望 救 恩 ， 却 远 离 我 们 。 \n [kjv] We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us. \n [bbe] We make noises of grief, like bears, and sad sounds like doves: we are looking for our right, but it is not there; for salvation, but it is far from us. \n 59:12 [hgb] 我 们 的 过 犯 在 你 面 前 增 多 ， 罪 恶 作 见 证 告 我 们 。 过 犯 与 我 们 同 在 。 至 于 我 们 的 罪 孽 ， 我 们 都 知 道 。 \n [kjv] For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them; \n [bbe] For our evil doings are increased before you, and our sins give witness against us: for our evil doings are with us, and we have knowledge of our sins: \n 59:13 [hgb] 就 是 悖 逆 不 认 识 耶 和 华 ， 转 去 不 跟 从 我 们 的 神 ， 说 欺 压 和 叛 逆 的 话 ， 心 怀 谎 言 ， 随 即 说 出 。 \n [kjv] In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. \n [bbe] We have gone against the Lord, and been false to him, turning away from our God, our words have been uncontrolled, and in our hearts are thoughts of deceit. \n 59:14 [hgb] 并 且 公 平 转 而 退 后 ， 公 义 站 在 远 处 。 诚 实 在 街 上 仆 倒 ， 正 直 也 不 得 进 入 。 \n [kjv] And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. \n [bbe] And the right is turned back, and righteousness is far away: for good faith is not to be seen in the public places, and upright behaviour may not come into the town. \n 59:15 [hgb] 诚 实 少 见 。 离 恶 的 人 反 成 掠 物 。 那 时 ， 耶 和 华 看 见 没 有 公 平 ， 甚 不 喜 悦 。 \n [kjv] Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. \n [bbe] Yes, faith is gone; and he whose heart is turned from evil comes into the power of the cruel: and the Lord saw it, and he was angry that there was no one to take up their cause. \n 59:16 [hgb] 他 见 无 人 拯 救 ， 无 人 代 求 ， 甚 为 诧 异 。 就 用 自 己 的 膀 臂 施 行 拯 救 。 以 公 义 扶 持 自 己 。 \n [kjv] And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. \n [bbe] And he saw that there was no man, and was surprised that there was no one to take up their cause: so his arm gave salvation, and he made righteousness his support. \n 59:17 [hgb] 他 以 公 义 为 铠 甲 ， （ 或 作 护 心 镜 ） 以 拯 救 为 头 盔 ， 以 报 仇 为 衣 服 ， 以 热 心 为 外 袍 。 \n [kjv] For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak. \n [bbe] Yes, he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and salvation as a head-dress; and he put on punishment as clothing, and wrath as a robe. \n 59:18 [hgb] 他 必 按 人 的 行 为 施 报 ， 恼 怒 他 的 敌 人 ， 报 复 他 的 仇 敌 ， 向 众 海 岛 施 行 报 应 。 \n [kjv] According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. \n [bbe] He will give them the right reward of their doings, wrath to his attackers, punishment to his haters, and even on the sea-lands he will send punishment. \n 59:19 [hgb] 如 此 ， 人 从 日 落 之 处 ， 必 敬 畏 耶 和 华 的 名 。 从 日 出 之 地 ， 也 必 敬 畏 他 的 荣 耀 。 因 为 仇 敌 好 像 急 流 的 河 水 冲 来 ， 是 耶 和 华 之 气 所 驱 逐 的 。 \n [kjv] So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him. \n [bbe] So they will see the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the east: for he will come like a rushing stream, forced on by a wind of the Lord. \n 59:20 [hgb] 必 有 一 位 救 赎 主 ， 来 到 锡 安 雅 各 族 中 转 离 过 犯 的 人 那 里 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] And as a saviour he will come to Zion, turning away sin from Jacob, says the Lord. \n 59:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 至 于 我 与 他 们 所 立 的 约 ， 乃 是 这 样 。 我 加 给 你 的 灵 ， 传 给 你 的 话 ， 必 不 离 你 的 口 ， 也 不 离 你 后 裔 与 你 后 裔 之 后 裔 的 口 ， 从 今 直 到 永 远 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed\u0027s seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever. \n [bbe] And as for me, this is my agreement with them, says the Lord: my spirit which is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, will not go away from your mouth, or from the mouth of your seed, or from the mouth of your seed\u0027s seed, says the Lord, from now and for ever. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1904.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
