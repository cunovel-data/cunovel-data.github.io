as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him. \n [bbe] And it will be the same for the people as for the priest; for the servant as for his master; and for the woman-servant as for her owner; the same for the one offering goods for a price as for him who takes them; the same for him who gives money at interest and for him who takes it; the same for him who lets others have the use of his property as for those who make use of it. \n 24:3 [hgb] 地 必 全 然 空 虚 ， 尽 都 荒 凉 。 因 为 这 话 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word. \n [bbe] The earth will be completely waste and without men; for this is the word of the Lord. \n 24:4 [hgb] 地 上 悲 哀 衰 残 ， 世 界 败 落 衰 残 ， 地 上 居 高 位 的 人 也 败 落 了 。 \n [kjv] The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish. \n [bbe] The earth is sorrowing and wasting away, the world is full of grief and wasting away, the high ones of the earth come to nothing. \n 24:5 [hgb] 地 被 其 上 的 居 民 污 秽 。 因 为 他 们 犯 了 律 法 ， 废 了 律 例 ， 背 了 永 约 。 \n [kjv] The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. \n [bbe] The earth has been made unclean by those living in it; because the laws have not been kept by them, the orders have been changed, and the eternal agreement has been broken. \n 24:6 [hgb] 所 以 地 被 咒 诅 吞 灭 ， 住 在 其 上 的 显 为 有 罪 。 地 上 的 居 民 被 火 焚 烧 ， 剩 下 的 人 稀 少 。 \n [kjv] Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. \n [bbe] For this cause the earth is given up to the curse, and those in it are judged as sinners: for this cause those living on the earth are burned up, and the rest are small in number. \n 24:7 [hgb] 新 酒 悲 哀 ， 葡 萄 树 衰 残 ， 心 中 欢 乐 的 ， 俱 都 叹 息 。 \n [kjv] The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh. \n [bbe] The new wine is thin, the vine is feeble, and all the glad-hearted make sounds of grief. \n 24:8 [hgb] 击 鼓 之 乐 止 息 ， 宴 乐 人 的 声 音 完 毕 ， 弹 琴 之 乐 也 止 息 了 。 \n [kjv] The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth. \n [bbe] The pleasing sound of all instruments of music has come to an end, and the voices of those who are glad. \n 24:9 [hgb] 人 必 不 得 饮 酒 唱 歌 。 喝 浓 酒 的 ， 必 以 为 苦 。 \n [kjv] They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. \n [bbe] There is no more drinking of wine with a song; strong drink will be bitter to those who take it. \n 24:10 [hgb] 荒 凉 的 城 拆 毁 了 。 各 家 关 门 闭 户 ， 使 人 都 不 得 进 去 。 \n [kjv] The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in. \n [bbe] The town is waste and broken down: every house is shut up, so that no man may come in. \n 24:11 [hgb] 在 街 上 因 酒 有 悲 叹 的 声 音 。 一 切 喜 乐 变 为 昏 暗 。 地 上 的 欢 乐 归 于 无 有 。 \n [kjv] There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone. \n [bbe] There is a crying in the streets because of the wine; there is an end of all delight, the joy of the land is gone. \n 24:12 [hgb] 城 中 只 有 荒 凉 ， 城 门 拆 毁 净 尽 。 \n [kjv] In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction. \n [bbe] In the town all is waste, and in the public place is destruction. \n 24:13 [hgb] 在 地 上 的 万 民 中 ， 必 像 打 过 的 橄 榄 树 ， 又 像 已 摘 的 葡 萄 所 剩 无 几 。 \n [kjv] When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done. \n [bbe] For it will be in the heart of the earth among the peoples, like the shaking of an olive-tree, as the last of the grapes after the getting-in is done. \n 24:14 [hgb] 这 些 人 要 高 声 欢 呼 。 他 们 为 耶 和 华 的 威 严 ， 从 海 那 里 扬 起 声 来 。 \n [kjv] They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea. \n [bbe] But those will be making sounds of joy; they will be crying loudly from the sea for the glory of the Lord. \n 24:15 [hgb] 因 此 你 们 要 在 东 方 荣 耀 耶 和 华 ， 在 众 海 岛 荣 耀 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 名 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea. \n [bbe] Give praise to the Lord in the east, to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, in the sea-lands. \n 24:16 [hgb] 我 们 听 见 从 地 极 有 人 歌 唱 ， 说 ， 荣 耀 归 于 义 人 。 我 却 说 ， 我 消 灭 了 ， 我 消 灭 了 ， 我 有 祸 了 。 诡 诈 的 行 诡 诈 ， 诡 诈 的 大 行 诡 诈 。 \n [kjv] From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. \n [bbe] From the farthest part of the earth comes the sound of songs, glory to the upright. But I said, I am wasting away, wasting away, the curse is on me! The false ones go on in their false way, yes, they go on acting falsely. \n 24:17 [hgb] 地 上 的 居 民 哪 ， 恐 惧 ， 陷 坑 ， 网 罗 ， 都 临 近 你 。 \n [kjv] Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth. \n [bbe] Fear, and death, and the net, are come on you, O people of the earth. \n 24:18 [hgb] 躲 避 恐 惧 声 音 的 必 坠 入 陷 坑 。 从 陷 坑 上 来 的 必 被 网 罗 缠 住 。 因 为 天 上 的 窗 户 都 开 了 ， 地 的 根 基 也 震 动 了 。 \n [kjv] And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. \n [bbe] And it will be that he who goes in flight from the sound of fear will be overtaken by death; and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net: for the windows on high are open, and the bases of the earth are shaking. \n 24:19 [hgb] 地 全 然 破 坏 ， 尽 都 崩 裂 ， 大 大 地 震 动 了 。 \n [kjv] The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. \n [bbe] The earth is completely broken, it is parted in two, it is violently moved. \n 24:20 [hgb] 地 要 东 倒 西 歪 ， 好 像 醉 酒 的 人 。 又 摇 来 摇 去 ， 好 像 吊 床 。 罪 过 在 其 上 沉 重 ， 必 然 塌 陷 ， 不 能 复 起 。 \n [kjv] The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again. \n [bbe] The earth will be moving uncertainly, like a man overcome by drink; it will be shaking like a tent; and the weight of its sin will be on it, crushing it down so that it will not get up again. \n 24:21 [hgb] 到 那 日 耶 和 华 在 高 处 必 惩 罚 高 处 的 众 军 ， 在 地 上 必 惩 罚 地 上 的 列 王 ， \n [kjv] And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. \n [bbe] And in that day the Lord will send punishment on the army of the high ones on high, and on the kings of the earth on the earth. \n 24:22 [hgb] 他 们 必 被 聚 集 ， 像 囚 犯 被 聚 在 牢 狱 中 ， 并 要 囚 在 监 牢 里 ， 多 日 之 后 便 被 讨 罪 。 （ 或 作 眷 顾 ） \n [kjv] And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited. \n [bbe] And they will be got together, like prisoners in the prison-house; and after a long time they will have their punishment. \n 24:23 [hgb] 那 时 月 亮 要 蒙 羞 ， 日 头 要 惭 愧 。 因 为 万 军 之 耶 和 华 必 在 锡 安 山 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 。 在 敬 畏 他 的 长 老 面 前 ， 必 有 荣 耀 。 \n [kjv] Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously. \n [bbe] Then the moon will be veiled, and the sun put to shame; for the Lord of armies will be ruling in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his judges he will let his glory be seen. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1869.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
