{"id":5463,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 31","content":"31:1 [hgb] 祸 哉 ， 那 些 下 埃 及 求 帮 助 的 ， 是 因 仗 赖 马 匹 ， 倚 靠 甚 多 的 车 辆 ， 并 倚 靠 强 壮 的 马 兵 ， 却 不 仰 望 以 色 列 的 圣 者 ， 也 不 求 问 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD! [bbe] Cursed are those who go down to Egypt for help, and who put their faith in horses; looking to war-carriages for salvation, because of their numbers; and to horsemen, because they are very strong; but they are not looking to the Holy One of Israel, or turning their hearts to the Lord; 31:2 [hgb] 其 实 耶 和 华 有 智 慧 。 他 必 降 灾 祸 ， 并 不 反 悔 自 己 的 话 ， 却 要 兴 起 攻 击 那 作 恶 之 家 ， 又 攻 击 那 作 孽 帮 助 人 的 。 [kjv] Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. [bbe] Though he is wise, and able to send evil, and his purpose will not be changed; but he will go against the house of the evil-doers, and against those to whom they are looking for help. 31:3 [hgb] 埃 及 人 不 过 是 人 ， 并 不 是 神 。 他 们 的 马 不 过 是 血 肉 ， 并 不 是 灵 。 耶 和 华 一 伸 手 ， 那 帮 助 人 的 必 绊 跌 ， 那 受 帮 助 的 也 必 跌 倒 ， 都 一 同 灭 亡 。 [kjv] Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together. [bbe] For the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses are flesh, and not spirit: and when the Lord\u0027s hand is stretched out, the helper and he who is helped will come down together. 31:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 我 如 此 说 ， 狮 子 和 少 壮 狮 子 ， 获 食 咆 哮 ， 就 是 喊 许 多 牧 人 来 攻 击 它 ， 它 总 不 因 他 们 的 声 音 惊 惶 ， 也 不 因 他 们 的 喧 哗 缩 伏 。 如 此 万 军 之 耶 和 华 ， 也 必 降 临 在 锡 安 山 冈 上 争 战 。 [kjv] For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof. [bbe] For the Lord has said to me, As a lion, or a young lion, makes an angry noise over his food, and if a band of herdsmen come out against him, he will not be in fear of their voices, or give up his food for their noise: so the Lord of armies will come down to make war against Mount Zion and its hill. 31:5 [hgb] 雀 鸟 怎 样 扇 翅 覆 雏 ， 万 军 之 耶 和 华 也 要 照 样 保 护 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 他 必 保 护 拯 救 ， 要 越 门 保 守 。 [kjv] As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it. [bbe] Like birds with outstretched wings, so will the Lord of armies be a cover to Jerusalem; he will be a cover and salvation for it, going over it he will keep it from danger. 31:6 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 哪 ， 你 们 深 深 地 悖 逆 耶 和 华 ， 现 今 要 归 向 他 。 [kjv] Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted. [bbe] Come back to him who has been so deeply sinned against by the children of Israel. 31:7 [hgb] 到 那 日 各 人 必 将 他 金 偶 像 ， 银 偶 像 ， 就 是 亲 手 所 造 陷 自 己 在 罪 中 的 ， 都 抛 弃 了 。 [kjv] For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin. [bbe] For in that day they will all give up their images of silver and of gold, the sin which they made for themselves. 31:8 [hgb] 亚 述 人 必 倒 在 刀 下 ， 并 非 人 的 刀 。 有 刀 要 将 他 吞 灭 ， 并 非 人 的 刀 。 他 必 逃 避 这 刀 ， 他 的 少 年 人 ， 必 成 为 服 苦 的 。 [kjv] Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited. [bbe] Then the Assyrian will come down by the sword, but not of man; the sword, not of men, will be the cause of his destruction: and he will go in flight from the sword, and his young men will be put to forced work. 31:9 [hgb] 他 的 磐 石 ， 必 因 惊 吓 挪 去 ， 他 的 首 领 ， 必 因 大 旗 惊 惶 。 这 是 那 有 火 在 锡 安 ， 有 炉 在 耶 路 撒 冷 的 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem. [bbe] And his rock will come to nothing because of fear, and his chiefs will go in flight from the flag, says the Lord, whose fire is in Zion, and his altar in Jerusalem.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1876.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
