Then said I, Here am I; send me. \n [bbe] And the voice of the Lord came to my ears, saying, Whom am I to send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I, send me. \n 6:9 [hgb] 他 说 ， 你 去 告 诉 这 百 姓 说 ， 你 们 听 是 要 听 见 ， 却 不 明 白 。 看 是 要 看 见 ， 却 不 晓 得 。 \n [kjv] And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. \n [bbe] And he said, Go, and say to this people, You will go on hearing, but learning nothing; you will go on seeing, but without getting wiser. \n 6:10 [hgb] 要 使 这 百 姓 心 蒙 脂 油 ， 耳 朵 发 沉 ， 眼 睛 昏 迷 。 恐 怕 眼 睛 看 见 ， 耳 朵 听 见 ， 心 里 明 白 ， 回 转 过 来 ， 便 得 医 治 。 \n [kjv] Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. \n [bbe] Make the hearts of this people fat, and let their ears be stopped, and their eyes shut; for fear that they may see with their eyes, and be hearing with their ears, and their heart may become wise, and they may be turned to me and made well. \n 6:11 [hgb] 我 就 说 ， 主 阿 ， 这 到 几 时 为 止 呢 ？ 他 说 ， 直 到 城 邑 荒 凉 ， 无 人 居 住 ， 房 屋 空 闲 无 人 ， 地 土 极 其 荒 凉 。 \n [kjv] Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, \n [bbe] Then I said, Lord, how long? And he said in answer, Till the towns are waste and unpeopled, and the houses have no men, and the land becomes completely waste, \n 6:12 [hgb] 并 且 耶 和 华 将 人 迁 到 远 方 ， 在 这 境 内 撇 下 的 地 土 很 多 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. \n [bbe] And the Lord has taken men far away, and there are wide waste places in the land. \n 6:13 [hgb] 境 内 剩 下 的 人 ， 若 还 有 十 分 之 一 ， 也 必 被 吞 灭 。 像 栗 树 ， 橡 树 ， 虽 被 砍 伐 ， 树 ？ ？ 子 ， 却 仍 存 留 。 这 圣 洁 的 种 类 在 国 中 也 是 如 此 。 \n [kjv] But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof. \n [bbe] And even if there is still a tenth part in it, it will again be burned, like a tree of the woods whose broken end is still in the earth after the tree has been cut down (the holy seed is the broken end). \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1851.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
