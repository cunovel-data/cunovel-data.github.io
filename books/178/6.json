{"id":5438,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"6:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 王 崩 的 那 年 ， 我 见 主 坐 在 高 高 的 宝 座 上 。 他 的 衣 裳 垂 下 ， 遮 满 圣 殿 。 [kjv] In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. [bbe] In the year of King Uzziah\u0027s death I saw the Lord seated in his place, high and lifted up, and the Temple was full of the wide skirts of his robe. 6:2 [hgb] 其 上 有 撒 拉 弗 侍 立 。 各 有 六 个 翅 膀 。 用 两 个 翅 膀 遮 脸 ， 两 个 翅 膀 遮 脚 ， 两 个 翅 膀 飞 翔 。 [kjv] Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. [bbe] Over him were the winged ones: every one had six wings; two for covering his face, two for covering his feed, and two for flight. 6:3 [hgb] 彼 此 呼 喊 说 ， 圣 哉 ， 圣 哉 ， 圣 哉 ， 万 军 之 耶 和 华 。 他 的 荣 光 充 满 全 地 。 [kjv] And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. [bbe] And one said in a loud voice to another, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of armies: all the earth is full of his glory. 6:4 [hgb] 因 呼 喊 者 的 声 音 ， 门 槛 的 根 基 震 动 ， 殿 充 满 了 烟 云 。 [kjv] And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. [bbe] And the bases of the door-pillars were shaking at the sound of his cry, and the house was full of smoke. 6:5 [hgb] 那 时 我 说 ， 祸 哉 ， 我 灭 亡 了 。 因 为 我 是 嘴 唇 不 洁 的 人 ， 又 住 在 嘴 唇 不 洁 的 民 中 。 又 因 我 眼 见 大 君 王 万 军 之 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts. [bbe] Then I said, The curse is on me, and my fate is destruction; for I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of armies. 6:6 [hgb] 有 一 撒 拉 弗 飞 到 我 跟 前 ， 手 里 拿 着 红 炭 ， 是 用 火 剪 从 坛 上 取 下 来 的 。 [kjv] Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: [bbe] Then a winged one came to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from off the altar with the fire-spoon. 6:7 [hgb] 将 炭 沾 我 的 口 ， 说 ， 看 哪 ， 这 炭 沾 了 你 的 嘴 。 你 的 罪 孽 便 除 掉 ， 你 的 罪 恶 就 赦 免 了 。 [kjv] And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. [bbe] And after touching my mouth with it, he said, See, your lips have been touched with this; and your evil is taken away, and you are made clean from sin. 6:8 [hgb] 我 又 听 见 主 的 声 音 ， 说 ， 我 可 以 差 遣 谁 呢 ？ 谁 肯 为 我 们 去 呢 ？ 我 说 ， 我 在 这 里 ， 请 差 遣 我 。 [kjv] Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. [bbe] And the voice of the Lord came to my ears, saying, Whom am I to send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I, send me. 6:9 [hgb] 他 说 ， 你 去 告 诉 这 百 姓 说 ， 你 们 听 是 要 听 见 ， 却 不 明 白 。 看 是 要 看 见 ， 却 不 晓 得 。 [kjv] And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. [bbe] And he said, Go, and say to this people, You will go on hearing, but learning nothing; you will go on seeing, but without getting wiser. 6:10 [hgb] 要 使 这 百 姓 心 蒙 脂 油 ， 耳 朵 发 沉 ， 眼 睛 昏 迷 。 恐 怕 眼 睛 看 见 ， 耳 朵 听 见 ， 心 里 明 白 ， 回 转 过 来 ， 便 得 医 治 。 [kjv] Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. [bbe] Make the hearts of this people fat, and let their ears be stopped, and their eyes shut; for fear that they may see with their eyes, and be hearing with their ears, and their heart may become wise, and they may be turned to me and made well. 6:11 [hgb] 我 就 说 ， 主 阿 ， 这 到 几 时 为 止 呢 ？ 他 说 ， 直 到 城 邑 荒 凉 ， 无 人 居 住 ， 房 屋 空 闲 无 人 ， 地 土 极 其 荒 凉 。 [kjv] Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, [bbe] Then I said, Lord, how long? And he said in answer, Till the towns are waste and unpeopled, and the houses have no men, and the land becomes completely waste, 6:12 [hgb] 并 且 耶 和 华 将 人 迁 到 远 方 ， 在 这 境 内 撇 下 的 地 土 很 多 。 [kjv] And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. [bbe] And the Lord has taken men far away, and there are wide waste places in the land. 6:13 [hgb] 境 内 剩 下 的 人 ， 若 还 有 十 分 之 一 ， 也 必 被 吞 灭 。 像 栗 树 ， 橡 树 ， 虽 被 砍 伐 ， 树 ？ ？ 子 ， 却 仍 存 留 。 这 圣 洁 的 种 类 在 国 中 也 是 如 此 。 [kjv] But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof. [bbe] And even if there is still a tenth part in it, it will again be burned, like a tree of the woods whose broken end is still in the earth after the tree has been cut down (the holy seed is the broken end).","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1851.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
