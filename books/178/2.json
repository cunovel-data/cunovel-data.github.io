{"id":5434,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"2:1 [hgb] 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. [bbe] The word which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem. 2:2 [hgb] 末 后 的 日 子 ， 耶 和 华 殿 的 山 必 坚 立 ， 超 乎 诸 山 ， 高 举 过 于 万 岭 。 万 民 都 要 流 归 这 山 。 [kjv] And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD\u0027s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. [bbe] And it will come about in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord will be placed on the top of the mountains, and be lifted up over the hills; and all nations will come to it. 2:3 [hgb] 必 有 许 多 国 的 民 前 往 ， 说 ， 来 吧 ， 我 们 登 耶 和 华 的 山 。 奔 雅 各 神 的 殿 。 主 必 将 他 的 道 教 训 我 们 ， 我 们 也 要 行 他 的 路 。 因 为 训 诲 必 出 于 锡 安 ， 耶 和 华 的 言 语 ， 必 出 于 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. [bbe] And the peoples will say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob: and he will give us knowledge of his ways, and we will be guided by his word; for out of Zion the law will go out, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 2:4 [hgb] 他 必 在 列 国 中 施 行 审 判 ， 为 许 多 国 民 断 定 是 非 。 他 们 要 将 刀 打 成 犁 头 ， 把 枪 打 成 镰 刀 。 这 国 不 举 刀 攻 击 那 国 ， 他 们 也 不 再 学 习 战 事 。 [kjv] And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. [bbe] And he will be the judge between the nations, and the peoples will be ruled by his decisions: and their swords will be turned into plough-blades, and their spears into vine-knives: no longer will the nations be turning their swords against one another, and the knowledge of war will be gone for ever. 2:5 [hgb] 雅 各 家 阿 ， 来 吧 ， 我 们 在 耶 和 华 的 光 明 中 行 走 。 [kjv] O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD. [bbe] O family of Jacob, come, and let us go in the light of the Lord. 2:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 ， 你 离 弃 了 你 百 姓 雅 各 家 ， 是 因 他 们 充 满 了 东 方 的 风 俗 ， 作 观 兆 的 ， 像 非 利 士 人 一 样 ， 并 与 外 邦 人 击 掌 。 [kjv] Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers. [bbe] For you, O Lord, have given up your people, the family of Jacob, because they are full of the evil ways of the east, and make use of secret arts like the Philistines, and are friends with the children of strange countries. 2:7 [hgb] 他 们 的 国 满 了 金 银 ， 财 宝 也 无 穷 ， 他 们 的 地 满 了 马 匹 ， 车 辆 也 无 数 。 [kjv] Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots: [bbe] And their land is full of silver and gold, and there is no end to their stores; their land is full of horses, and there is no end to their carriages. 2:8 [hgb] 他 们 的 地 满 了 偶 像 。 他 们 跪 拜 自 己 手 所 造 的 ， 就 是 自 己 指 头 所 作 的 。 [kjv] Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made: [bbe] Their land is full of images; they give worship to the work of their hands, even to that which their fingers have made. 2:9 [hgb] 卑 贱 人 屈 膝 ， 尊 贵 人 下 跪 。 所 以 不 可 饶 恕 他 们 。 [kjv] And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not. [bbe] And the poor man\u0027s head is bent, and the great man goes down on his face: for this cause there will be no forgiveness for their sin. 2:10 [hgb] 你 当 进 入 岩 穴 ， 藏 在 土 中 ， 躲 避 耶 和 华 的 惊 吓 ， 和 他 威 严 的 荣 光 。 [kjv] Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty. [bbe] Go into a hole in the rock, covering yourselves with dust, in fear of the Lord, before the glory of his power. 2:11 [hgb] 到 那 日 ， 眼 目 高 傲 的 必 降 为 卑 ， 性 情 狂 傲 的 都 必 屈 膝 。 惟 独 耶 和 华 被 尊 崇 。 [kjv] The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. [bbe] The high looks of man will be put to shame, and the pride of men will be made low, and only the Lord will be lifted up in that day. 2:12 [hgb] 必 有 万 军 耶 和 华 降 罚 的 一 个 日 子 ， 要 临 到 骄 傲 狂 妄 的 ， 一 切 自 高 的 ， 都 必 降 为 卑 。 [kjv] For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low: [bbe] For the day of the Lord of armies is coming on all the pride of men, and on all who are high and lifted up; 2:13 [hgb] 又 临 到 利 巴 嫩 高 大 的 香 柏 树 ， 和 巴 珊 的 橡 树 。 [kjv] And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, [bbe] And on all the high trees of Lebanon, and on all the strong trees of Bashan; 2:14 [hgb] 又 临 到 一 切 高 山 的 峻 岭 。 [kjv] And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, [bbe] And on all the high mountains, and on all the hills which are lifted up; 2:15 [hgb] 又 临 到 高 台 和 坚 固 城 墙 。 [kjv] And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, [bbe] And on every high tower, and on every strong wall; 2:16 [hgb] 又 临 到 他 施 的 船 只 ， 并 一 切 可 爱 的 美 物 。 [kjv] And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. [bbe] And on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all the fair boats. 2:17 [hgb] 骄 傲 的 必 屈 膝 ， 狂 妄 的 必 降 卑 。 在 那 日 ， 惟 独 耶 和 华 被 尊 崇 。 [kjv] And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. [bbe] And the high looks of man will be put to shame, and the pride of men will be made low: and only the Lord will be lifted up in that day. 2:18 [hgb] 偶 像 必 全 然 废 弃 [kjv] And the idols he shall utterly abolish. [bbe] And the images will never be seen again. 2:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 兴 起 使 地 大 震 动 的 时 候 ， 人 就 进 入 石 洞 ， 进 入 土 穴 ， 躲 避 耶 和 华 的 惊 吓 ， 和 他 威 严 的 荣 光 。 [kjv] And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. [bbe] And men will go into cracks of the rocks, and into holes of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and before the glory of his power, when he comes out of his place, shaking the earth with his strength. 2:20 [hgb] 到 那 日 ， 人 必 将 为 拜 而 造 的 金 偶 像 ， 银 偶 像 ， 抛 给 田 鼠 和 蝙 蝠 。 [kjv] In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; [bbe] In that day men will put their images of silver and of gold, which they made for worship, in the keeping of the beasts of the dark places; 2:21 [hgb] 到 耶 和 华 兴 起 使 地 大 震 动 的 时 候 ， 人 好 进 入 磐 石 洞 中 ， 和 岩 石 穴 里 ， 躲 避 耶 和 华 的 惊 吓 ， 和 他 威 严 的 荣 光 。 [kjv] To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. [bbe] To take cover in the cracks of the rocks, and in the holes of the hills, for fear of the Lord, and before the glory of his power, when he comes out of his place, shaking the earth with his strength. 2:22 [hgb] 你 们 休 要 倚 靠 世 人 ， 他 鼻 孔 里 不 过 有 气 息 。 他 在 一 切 事 上 可 算 什 么 呢 ？ [kjv] Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of ? [bbe] Have no more to do with man, whose life is only a breath, for he is of no value.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1847.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
