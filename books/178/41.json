I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he. \n [bbe] Whose purpose and work was it? His who sent out the generations from the start. I the Lord, the first, and with the last, I am he. \n 41:5 [hgb] 海 岛 看 见 就 都 害 怕 ， 地 极 也 都 战 兢 ， 就 近 前 来 。 \n [kjv] The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came. \n [bbe] The sea-lands saw it, and were in fear; the ends of the earth were shaking: they came near. \n 41:6 [hgb] 他 们 各 人 帮 助 邻 舍 ， 各 人 对 弟 兄 说 ， 壮 胆 吧 。 \n [kjv] They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage. \n [bbe] They gave help everyone to his neighbour; and everyone said to his brother, Take heart! \n 41:7 [hgb] 木 匠 勉 励 银 匠 ， 用 锤 打 光 的 勉 励 打 砧 的 ， 论 焊 工 说 ， 焊 得 好 。 又 用 钉 子 钉 稳 ， 免 得 偶 像 动 摇 。 \n [kjv] So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved. \n [bbe] So the metal-worker put heart into the gold-worker, and he who was hammering the metal smooth said kind words to the iron-worker, saying of the plate, It is ready: and he put it together with nails, so that there might be no slipping. \n 41:8 [hgb] 惟 你 以 色 列 我 的 仆 人 ， 雅 各 我 所 拣 选 的 ， 我 朋 友 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， \n [kjv] But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend. \n [bbe] But as for you, Israel, my servant, and you, Jacob, whom I have taken for myself, the seed of Abraham my friend: \n 41:9 [hgb] 你 是 我 从 地 极 所 领 （ 原 文 作 抓 ） 来 的 ， 从 地 角 所 召 来 的 ， 且 对 你 说 ， 你 是 我 的 仆 人 ， 我 拣 选 你 并 不 弃 绝 你 。 \n [kjv] Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away. \n [bbe] You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and sent for from its farthest parts, saying to you, You are my servant, whom I have taken for myself, and whom I have not given up: \n 41:10 [hgb] 你 不 要 害 怕 ， 因 为 我 与 你 同 在 。 不 要 惊 惶 ， 因 为 我 是 你 的 神 。 我 必 坚 固 你 ， 我 必 帮 助 你 ， 我 必 用 我 公 义 的 右 手 扶 持 你 。 \n [kjv] Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. \n [bbe] Have no fear, for I am with you; do not be looking about in trouble, for I am your God; I will give you strength, yes, I will be your helper; yes, my true right hand will be your support. \n 41:11 [hgb] 凡 向 你 发 怒 的 ， 必 都 抱 愧 蒙 羞 。 与 你 相 争 的 ， 必 如 无 有 ， 并 要 灭 亡 。 \n [kjv] Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish. \n [bbe] Truly, all those who are angry with you will be made low and put to shame: those desiring to do you wrong will come to nothing and never again be seen. \n 41:12 [hgb] 与 你 争 竞 的 ， 你 要 找 他 们 也 找 不 着 。 与 你 争 战 的 ， 必 如 无 有 ， 成 为 虚 无 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. \n [bbe] You will make search for your haters but they will not be there; those who make war against you will be as nothing and will come to destruction. \n 41:13 [hgb] 因 为 我 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 必 搀 扶 你 的 右 手 ， 对 你 说 ， 不 要 害 怕 ， 我 必 帮 助 你 。 \n [kjv] For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee. \n [bbe] For I, the Lord your God, have taken your right hand in mine, saying to you, Have no fear; I will be your helper. \n 41:14 [hgb] 你 这 虫 雅 各 ， 和 你 们 以 色 列 人 ， 不 要 害 怕 。 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 必 帮 助 你 。 你 的 救 赎 主 ， 就 是 以 色 列 的 圣 者 。 \n [kjv] Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. \n [bbe] Have no fear, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will be your helper, says the Lord, even he who takes up your cause, the Holy One of Israel. \n 41:15 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 我 已 使 你 成 为 有 快 齿 打 粮 的 新 器 具 ， 你 要 把 山 岭 打 得 粉 碎 ， 使 冈 陵 如 同 糠 秕 。 \n [kjv] Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff. \n [bbe] See, I will make you like a new grain-crushing instrument with teeth, crushing the mountains small, and making the hills like dry stems. \n 41:16 [hgb] 你 要 把 他 簸 扬 风 要 吹 去 ， 旋 风 要 把 他 刮 散 。 你 倒 要 以 耶 和 华 为 喜 乐 ， 以 以 色 列 的 圣 者 为 夸 耀 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel. \n [bbe] You will send the wind over them, and it will take them away; they will go in all directions before the storm-wind: you will have joy in the Lord, and be glad in the Holy One of Israel. \n 41:17 [hgb] 困 苦 穷 乏 人 寻 求 水 却 没 有 ， 他 们 因 口 渴 ， 舌 头 干 燥 。 我 耶 和 华 必 应 允 他 们 ， 我 以 色 列 的 神 必 不 离 弃 他 们 。 \n [kjv] When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. \n [bbe] The poor and crushed are looking for water where no water is, and their tongue is dry for need of it: I the Lord will give ear to their prayer, I the God of Israel will not give them up. \n 41:18 [hgb] 我 要 在 净 光 的 高 处 开 江 河 ， 在 谷 中 开 泉 源 ， 我 要 使 沙 漠 变 为 水 池 ， 使 干 地 变 为 涌 泉 。 \n [kjv] I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. \n [bbe] I will make rivers on the dry mountain-tops, and fountains in the valleys: I will make the waste land a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. \n 41:19 [hgb] 我 要 在 旷 野 种 上 香 柏 树 ， 皂 荚 树 ， 番 石 榴 树 ， 和 野 橄 榄 树 。 我 在 沙 漠 要 把 松 树 ， 杉 树 ， 并 黄 杨 树 ， 一 同 栽 植 。 \n [kjv] I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together: \n [bbe] I will put in the waste land the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive-tree; and in the lowland will be planted the fir-tree, the plane, and the cypress together: \n 41:20 [hgb] 好 叫 人 看 见 ， 知 道 ， 思 想 ， 明 白 ， 这 是 耶 和 华 的 手 所 作 的 ， 是 以 色 列 的 圣 者 所 造 的 。 \n [kjv] That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it. \n [bbe] So that they may see and be wise and give their mind to it, and that it may be clear to them all that the hand of the Lord has done this, and that the Holy One of Israel has made it. \n 41:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 假 神 说 ， 你 们 要 呈 上 你 们 的 案 件 ， 雅 各 的 君 说 ， 你 们 要 声 明 你 们 确 实 的 理 由 。 \n [kjv] Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob. \n [bbe] Put forward your cause, says the Lord; let your strong argument come out, says the King of Jacob. \n 41:22 [hgb] 可 以 声 明 ， 指 示 我 们 将 来 必 遇 的 事 ， 说 明 先 前 的 是 什 么 事 ， 好 叫 我 们 思 索 ， 得 知 事 的 结 局 ， 或 者 把 将 来 的 事 指 示 我 们 。 \n [kjv] Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come. \n [bbe] Let the future be made clear to us: give us news of the past things, so that we may give thought to them; or of the things to come, so that we may see if they are true. \n 41:23 [hgb] 要 说 明 后 来 的 事 ， 好 叫 我 们 知 道 你 们 是 神 ， 你 们 或 降 福 ， 或 降 祸 ， 使 我 们 惊 奇 ， 一 同 观 看 。 \n [kjv] Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together. \n [bbe] Give us word of what will be after this, so that we may be certain that you are gods: yes, do good or do evil, so that we may all see it and be surprised. \n 41:24 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 你 们 属 乎 虚 无 ， 你 们 的 作 为 也 属 乎 虚 空 。 那 选 择 你 们 的 是 可 憎 恶 的 。 \n [kjv] Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination is he that chooseth you. \n [bbe] But you are nothing, and your work is of no value: foolish is he who takes you for his gods. \n 41:25 [hgb] 我 从 北 方 兴 起 一 人 ， 他 是 求 告 我 名 的 ， 从 日 出 之 地 而 来 。 他 必 临 到 掌 权 的 ， 好 像 临 到 灰 泥 ， 仿 佛 窑 匠 踹 泥 一 样 。 \n [kjv] I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth clay. \n [bbe] I have sent for one from the north, and from the dawn he has come; in my name he will get rulers together and go against them; they will be like dust, even as the wet earth is stamped on by the feet of the potter. \n 41:26 [hgb] 谁 从 起 初 指 明 这 事 ， 使 我 们 知 道 呢 ？ 谁 从 先 前 说 明 ， 使 我 们 说 ， 他 不 错 呢 ？ 谁 也 没 有 指 明 ， 谁 也 没 有 说 明 。 谁 也 没 有 听 见 你 们 的 话 。 \n [kjv] Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that heareth your words. \n [bbe] Who has given knowledge of it from the first, so that we may be certain of it? and from the start, so that we may say, His word is true? There is no one who gives news, or says anything, or who gives ear to your words. \n 41:27 [hgb] 我 首 先 对 锡 安 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 要 将 一 位 报 好 信 息 的 赐 给 耶 路 撒 冷 。 \n [kjv] The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings. \n [bbe] I was the first to give word of it to Zion, and I gave the good news to Jerusalem. \n 41:28 [hgb] 我 看 的 时 候 并 没 有 人 ， 我 问 的 时 候 他 们 中 间 也 没 有 谋 士 ， 可 以 回 答 一 句 。 \n [kjv] For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word. \n [bbe] And I saw that there was no man, even no wise man among them, who might give an answer to my questions. \n 41:29 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 他 们 和 他 们 的 工 作 ， 都 是 虚 空 ， 且 是 虚 无 。 他 们 所 铸 的 偶 像 都 是 风 ， 都 是 虚 的 。 \n [kjv] Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion. \n [bbe] Truly they are all nothing, their works are nothing and of no value: their metal images are of no more use than wind. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1886.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
