{"id":5482,"no":50,"title":"Chapter 50","content":"50:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 休 你 们 的 母 亲 ， 休 书 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 我 将 你 们 卖 给 我 哪 一 个 债 主 呢 ？ 你 们 被 卖 ， 是 因 你 们 的 罪 孽 。 你 们 的 母 亲 被 休 ， 是 因 你 们 的 过 犯 。 \n [kjv] Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother\u0027s divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away. \n [bbe] This is the word of the Lord: Where is the statement which I gave your mother when I put her away? or to which of my creditors have I given you for money? It was for your sins that you were given into the hands of others, and for your evil-doing was your mother put away. \n 50:2 [hgb] 我 来 的 时 候 ， 为 何 无 人 等 候 呢 ？ 我 呼 唤 的 时 候 ， 为 何 无 人 答 应 呢 ？ 我 的 膀 臂 岂 是 缩 短 ， 不 能 救 赎 吗 ？ 我 岂 无 拯 救 之 力 吗 ？ 看 哪 ， 我 一 斥 责 ， 海 就 干 了 ， 我 使 江 河 变 为 旷 野 。 其 中 的 鱼 因 无 水 腥 臭 ， 干 渴 而 死 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst. \n [bbe] Why, then, when I came, was there no man? and no one to give answer to my voice? has my hand become feeble, so that it is unable to take up your cause? or have I no power to make you free? See, at my word the sea becomes dry, I make the rivers a waste land: their fish are dead for need of water, and make an evil smell. \n 50:3 [hgb] 我 使 诸 天 以 黑 暗 为 衣 服 ， 以 麻 布 为 遮 盖 。 \n [kjv] I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering. \n [bbe] By me the heavens are clothed with black, and I make haircloth their robe. \n 50:4 [hgb] 主 耶 和 华 赐 我 受 教 者 的 舌 头 ， 使 我 知 道 怎 样 用 言 语 扶 助 疲 乏 的 人 。 主 每 早 晨 提 醒 ， 提 醒 我 的 耳 朵 ， 使 我 能 听 ， 像 受 教 者 一 样 。 \n [kjv] The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned. \n [bbe] The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are experienced, so that I may be able to give the word a special sense for the feeble: every morning my ear is open to his teaching, like those who are experienced: \n 50:5 [hgb] 主 耶 和 华 开 通 我 的 耳 朵 ， 我 并 没 有 违 背 ， 也 没 有 退 后 。 \n [kjv] The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. \n [bbe] And I have not put myself against him, or let my heart be turned back from him. \n 50:6 [hgb] 人 打 我 的 背 ， 我 任 他 打 。 人 拔 我 腮 颊 的 胡 须 ， 我 由 他 拔 。 人 辱 我 吐 我 ， 我 并 不 掩 面 。 \n [kjv] I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting. \n [bbe] I was offering my back to those who gave me blows, and my face to those who were pulling out my hair: I did not keep my face covered from marks of shame. \n 50:7 [hgb] 主 耶 和 华 必 帮 助 我 ， 所 以 我 不 抱 愧 。 我 硬 着 脸 面 好 像 坚 石 ， 我 也 知 道 我 必 不 至 蒙 羞 。 \n [kjv] For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed. \n [bbe] For the Lord God is my helper; I will not be put to shame: so I have made my face like a rock, and I am certain that he will give me my right. \n 50:8 [hgb] 称 我 为 义 的 与 我 相 近 。 谁 与 我 争 论 ， 可 以 与 我 一 同 站 立 。 谁 与 我 作 对 ， 可 以 就 近 我 来 。 \n [kjv] He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me. \n [bbe] He who takes up my cause is near; who will go to law with me? let us come together before the judge: who is against me? let him come near to me. \n 50:9 [hgb] 主 耶 和 华 要 帮 助 我 。 谁 能 定 我 有 罪 呢 ？ 他 们 都 像 衣 服 渐 渐 旧 了 ， 为 蛀 虫 所 咬 。 \n [kjv] Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up. \n [bbe] See, the Lord God is my helper; who will give a decision against me? truly, all of them will become old like a robe; they will be food for the worm. \n 50:10 [hgb] 你 们 中 间 谁 是 敬 畏 耶 和 华 听 从 他 仆 人 之 话 的 。 这 人 行 在 暗 中 ， 没 有 亮 光 ， 当 倚 靠 耶 和 华 的 名 ， 仗 赖 自 己 的 神 。 \n [kjv] Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God. \n [bbe] Who among you has the fear of the Lord, giving ear to the voice of his servant who has been walking in the dark and has no light? Let him put his faith in the name of the Lord, looking to his God for support. \n 50:11 [hgb] 凡 你 们 点 火 用 火 把 围 绕 自 己 的 。 可 以 行 在 你 们 的 火 焰 里 ， 并 你 们 所 点 的 火 把 中 。 这 是 我 手 所 定 的 。 你 们 必 躺 在 悲 惨 之 中 。 \n [kjv] Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow. \n [bbe] See, all you who make a fire, arming yourselves with burning branches: go in the flame of your fire, and among the branches you have put a light to. This will you have from my hand, you will make your bed in sorrow. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1895.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
