{"id":5495,"no":63,"title":"Chapter 63","content":"63:1 [hgb] 这 从 以 东 的 波 斯 拉 来 ， 穿 红 衣 服 ， 装 扮 华 美 ， 能 力 广 大 ， 大 步 行 走 的 是 谁 呢 ？ 就 是 我 ， 是 凭 公 义 说 话 ， 以 大 能 施 行 拯 救 。 [kjv] Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. [bbe] Who is this who comes from Edom, with blood-red robes from Bozrah? he whose clothing is fair, stepping with pride in his great strength? I whose glory is in the right, strong for salvation. 63:2 [hgb] 你 的 装 扮 为 何 有 红 色 ， 你 的 衣 服 为 何 像 踹 酒 榨 的 呢 ？ [kjv] Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? [bbe] Why is your clothing red, and why are your robes like those of one who is crushing the grapes? 63:3 [hgb] 我 独 自 踹 酒 榨 。 众 民 中 无 一 人 与 我 同 在 。 我 发 怒 将 他 们 踹 下 ， 发 烈 怒 将 他 们 践 踏 。 他 们 的 血 溅 在 我 衣 服 上 ， 并 且 污 染 了 我 一 切 的 衣 裳 。 [kjv] I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. [bbe] I have been crushing the grapes by myself, and of the peoples there was no man with me: in my wrath and in my passion, they were crushed under my feet; and my robes are marked with their life-blood, and all my clothing is red. 63:4 [hgb] 因 为 报 仇 之 日 在 我 心 中 ， 救 赎 我 民 之 年 已 经 来 到 。 [kjv] For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. [bbe] For the day of punishment is in my heart, and the year for the payment of the price for my people has come. 63:5 [hgb] 我 仰 望 ， 见 无 人 帮 助 。 我 诧 异 ， 没 有 人 扶 持 。 所 以 我 自 己 的 膀 臂 为 我 施 行 拯 救 。 我 的 烈 怒 将 我 扶 持 。 [kjv] And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. [bbe] And I saw that there was no helper, and I was wondering that no one gave them support: so my arm did the work of salvation, and my wrath was my support. 63:6 [hgb] 我 发 怒 ， 踹 下 众 民 ， 发 烈 怒 ， 使 他 们 沉 醉 ， 又 将 他 们 的 血 倒 在 地 上 。 [kjv] And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth. [bbe] And in my passion the peoples were crushed under my feet, and broken in my wrath, and I put down their strength to the earth. 63:7 [hgb] 我 要 照 耶 和 华 一 切 所 赐 给 我 们 的 ， 提 起 他 的 慈 爱 ， 和 美 德 ， 并 他 向 以 色 列 家 所 施 的 大 恩 ， 这 恩 是 照 他 的 怜 恤 和 丰 盛 的 慈 爱 赐 给 他 们 的 。 [kjv] I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. [bbe] I will give news of the mercies of the Lord, and his great acts, even all the things the Lord has done for us, in his great grace to the house of Israel; even all he has done for us in his unnumbered mercies. 63:8 [hgb] 他 说 ， 他 们 诚 然 是 我 的 百 姓 ， 不 行 虚 假 的 子 民 。 这 样 ， 他 就 作 了 他 们 的 救 主 。 [kjv] For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour. [bbe] For he said, Truly they are my people, children who will not be false: so he was their saviour out of all their trouble. 63:9 [hgb] 他 们 在 一 切 苦 难 中 ， 他 也 同 受 苦 难 。 并 且 他 面 前 的 使 者 拯 救 他 们 。 他 以 慈 爱 和 怜 悯 救 赎 他 们 。 在 古 时 的 日 子 ， 常 保 抱 他 们 ， 怀 搋 他 们 。 [kjv] In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old. [bbe] It was no sent one or angel, but he himself who was their saviour: in his love and in his pity he took up their cause, and he took them in his arms, caring for them all through the years. 63:10 [hgb] 他 们 竟 悖 逆 ， 使 主 的 圣 灵 担 忧 。 他 就 转 作 他 们 的 仇 敌 ， 亲 自 攻 击 他 们 。 [kjv] But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them. [bbe] But they went against him, causing grief to his holy spirit: so he was turned against them, and made war on them. 63:11 [hgb] 那 时 ， 他 们 （ 原 文 作 他 ） 想 起 古 时 的 日 子 摩 西 和 他 百 姓 ， 说 ， 将 百 姓 和 牧 养 他 全 群 的 人 从 海 里 领 上 来 的 ， 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 将 他 的 圣 灵 降 在 他 们 中 间 的 ， 在 哪 里 呢 ？ [kjv] Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him? [bbe] Then the early days came to their minds, the days of Moses his servant: and they said, Where is he who made the keeper of his flock come up from the sea? where is he who put his holy spirit among them, 63:12 [hgb] 使 他 荣 耀 的 膀 臂 在 摩 西 的 右 手 边 行 动 ， 在 他 们 前 面 将 水 分 开 ， 要 建 立 自 己 永 远 的 名 ， [kjv] That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name? [bbe] He who made the arm of his glory go at the right hand of Moses, by whom the waters were parted before them, to make himself an eternal name; 63:13 [hgb] 带 领 他 们 经 过 深 处 ， 如 马 行 走 旷 野 ， 使 他 们 不 至 绊 跌 的 ， 在 哪 里 呢 ？ [kjv] That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble? [bbe] He who made them go through the deep waters, like a horse in the waste land? 63:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 灵 使 他 们 得 安 息 ， 仿 佛 牲 畜 下 到 山 谷 ， 照 样 ， 你 也 引 导 你 的 百 姓 ， 要 建 立 自 己 荣 耀 的 名 。 [kjv] As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name. [bbe] Like the cattle which go down into the valley, they went without falling, the spirit of the Lord guiding them: so you went before your people, to make yourself a great name. 63:15 [hgb] 求 你 从 天 上 垂 顾 ， 从 你 圣 洁 荣 耀 的 居 所 观 看 。 你 的 热 心 和 你 大 能 的 作 为 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 你 爱 慕 的 心 肠 和 怜 悯 向 我 们 止 住 了 。 [kjv] Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained? [bbe] Let your eyes be looking down from heaven, from your holy and beautiful house: where is your deep feeling, the working of your power? do not keep back the moving of your pity and your mercies: 63:16 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 虽 然 不 认 识 我 们 ， 以 色 列 也 不 承 认 我 们 ， 你 却 是 我 们 的 父 。 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 是 我 们 的 父 。 从 万 古 以 来 ， 你 名 称 为 我 们 的 救 赎 主 。 [kjv] Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting. [bbe] For you are our father, though Abraham has no knowledge of us, and Israel gives no thought to us: you, O Lord, are our father; from the earliest days you have taken up our cause. 63:17 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 为 何 使 我 们 走 差 离 开 你 的 道 ， 使 我 们 心 里 刚 硬 不 敬 畏 你 呢 ？ 求 你 为 你 仆 人 为 你 产 业 支 派 的 缘 故 转 回 来 。 [kjv] O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants\u0027 sake, the tribes of thine inheritance. [bbe] O Lord, why do you send us wandering from your ways, making our hearts hard, so that we have no fear of you? Come back, because of your servants, the tribes of your heritage. 63:18 [hgb] 你 的 圣 民 不 过 暂 时 得 这 产 业 。 我 们 的 敌 人 已 经 践 踏 你 的 圣 所 。 [kjv] The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary. [bbe] Why have evil men gone over your holy place, so that it has been crushed under the feet of our haters? 63:19 [hgb] 我 们 好 象 你 未 曾 治 理 的 人 ， 又 像 未 曾 得 称 你 名 下 的 人 。 [kjv] We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name. [bbe] We have become as those who were never ruled by you, on whom your name was not named.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127/1908.html","bookId":178,"book":{"id":178,"title":"以赛亚书 Isaiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 ， 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 得 默 示 ， 论 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Je...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
