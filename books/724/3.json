{"id":13659,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER THREE","content":"\"Well,\" I thought, \"if I\u0027m in for an adventure I may as well be spry about it. Andrew\u0027ll be home by half-past twelve and if I\u0027m going to give him the slip I\u0027d better get a start. I suppose he\u0027ll think I\u0027m crazy! He\u0027ll follow me, I guess. Well, he just shan\u0027t catch me, that\u0027s all!\" A kind of anger came over me to think that I\u0027d been living on that farm for nearly fifteen years—yes, sir, ever since I was twenty-five—and hardly ever been away except for that trip to Boston once a year to go shopping with cousin Edie. I\u0027m a home-keeping soul, I guess, and I love my kitchen and my preserve cupboard and my linen closet as well as grandmother ever did, but something in that blue October air and that crazy little red-bearded man just tickled me. \"Look here, Mr. Parnassus,\" I said, \"I guess I\u0027m a fat old fool but I just believe I\u0027ll do that. You hitch up your horse and van and I\u0027ll go pack some clothes and write you a check. It\u0027ll do Andrew all the good in the world to have me skip. I\u0027ll get a chance to read a few books, too. It\u0027ll be as good as going to college!\" And I untied my apron and ran for the house. The little man stood leaning against a corner of the van as if he were stupefied. I dare say he was. I ran into the house through the front door, and it struck me as comical to see a copy of one of Andrew\u0027s magazines lying on the living-room table with \"The Revolt of Womanhood\" printed across it in red letters. \"Here goes for the revolt of Helen McGill,\" I thought. I sat down at Andrew\u0027s desk, pushed aside a pad of notes he had been jotting down about \"the magic of autumn,\" and scrawled a few lines: DEAR ANDREW, Don\u0027t be thinking I\u0027m crazy. I\u0027ve gone off for an adventure. It just came over me that you\u0027ve had all the adventures while I\u0027ve been at home baking bread. Mrs. McNally will look after your meals and one of her girls can come over to do the housework. So don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m going off for a little while—a month, maybe—to see some of this happiness and hayseed of yours. It\u0027s what the magazines call the revolt of womanhood. Warm underwear in the cedar chest in the spare room when you need it. With love, HELEN. I left the note on his desk. Mrs. McNally was bending over the tubs in the laundry. I could see only the broad arch of her back and hear the vigorous zzzzzzz of her rubbing. She straightened up at my call. \"Mrs. McNally,\" I said, \"I\u0027m going away for a little trip. You\u0027d better let the washing go until this afternoon and get Andrew\u0027s dinner for him. He\u0027ll be back about twelve-thirty. It\u0027s half-past ten now. You tell him I\u0027ve gone over to see Mrs. Collins at Locust Farm.\" Mrs. McNally is a brawny, slow-witted Swede. \"All right Mis\u0027 McGill,\" she said. \"You be back to denner?\" \"No, I\u0027m not coming back for a month,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going away for a trip. I want you to send Rosie over here every day to do the housework while I\u0027m away. You can arrange with Mr. McGill about that. I\u0027ve got to hurry now.\" Mrs. McNally\u0027s honest eyes, as blue as Copenhagen china, gazing through the window in perplexity, fell upon the travelling Parnassus and Mr. Mifflin backing Pegasus into the shafts. I saw her make a valiant effort to comprehend the sign painted on the side of the van—and give it up. \"You going driving?\" she said blankly. \"Yes,\" I said, and fled upstairs. I always keep my bank book in an old Huyler box in the top drawer of my bureau. I don\u0027t save very quickly, I\u0027m afraid. I have a little income from some money father left me, but Andrew takes care of that. Andrew pays all the farm expenses, but the housekeeping accounts fall to me. I make a fairish amount of pin money on my poultry and some of my preserves that I send to Boston, and on some recipes of mine that I send to a woman\u0027s magazine now and then; but generally my savings don\u0027t amount to much over $10 a month. In the last five years I had put by something more than $600. I had been saving up for a Ford. But just now it looked to me as if that Parnassus would be more fun than a Ford ever could be. Four hundred dollars was a lot of money, but I thought of what it would mean to have Andrew come home and buy it. Why, he\u0027d be away until Thanksgiving! Whereas if I bought it I could take it away, have my adventure, and sell it somewhere so that Andrew never need see it. I hardened my heart and determined to give the Sage of Redfield some of his own medicine. My balance at the Redfield National Bank was $615.20. I sat down at the table in my bedroom where I keep my accounts and wrote out a check to Roger Mifflin for $400. I put in plenty of curlicues after the figures so that no one could raise the check into $400,000; then I got out my old rattan suit case and put in some clothes. The whole business didn\u0027t take me ten minutes. I came downstairs to find Mrs. McNally looking sourly at the Parnassus from the kitchen door. \"You going away in that—that \u0027bus, Mis\u0027 McGill?\" she asked. \"Yes, Mrs. McNally,\" I said cheerfully. Her use of the word gave me an inspiration. \"That\u0027s one of the new jitney \u0027buses we hear about. He\u0027s going to take me to the station. Don\u0027t you worry about me. I\u0027m going for a holiday. You get Mr. McGill\u0027s dinner ready for him. After dinner tell him there\u0027s a note for him in the living-room.\" \"I tank that bane a queer \u0027bus,\" said Mrs. McNally, puzzled. I think the excellent woman suspected an elopement. I carried my suit case out to the Parnassus. Pegasus stood placidly between the shafts. From within came sounds of vigorous movement. In a moment the little man burst out with a bulging portmanteau in his hand. He had a tweed cap slanted on the back of his head. \"There!\" he cried triumphantly. \"I\u0027ve packed all my personal effects—clothes and so on—and everything else goes with the transaction. When I get on the train with this bag I\u0027m a free man, and hurrah for Brooklyn! Lord, won\u0027t I be glad to get back to the city! I lived in Brooklyn once, and I haven\u0027t been back there for ten years,\" he added plaintively. \"Here\u0027s the check,\" I said, handing it to him. He flushed a little, and looked at me rather shamefacedly. \"See here,\" he said, \"I hope you\u0027re not making a bad bargain? I don\u0027t want to take advantage of a lady. If you think your brother....\" \"I was going to buy a Ford, anyway,\" I said, \"and it looks to me as though this parcheesi of yours would be cheaper to run than any flivver that ever came out of Detroit. I want to keep it away from Andrew and that\u0027s the main thing. You give me a receipt and we\u0027ll get away from here before he comes back.\" He took the check without a word, hoisted his fat portmanteau on the driver\u0027s seat, and then disappeared in the van. In a minute he reappeared. On the back of one of his poetical cards he had written: Received from Miss McGill the sum of four hundred dollars in exchange for one Travelling Parnassus in first class condition, delivered to her this day, October 3rd, 19—. Signed ROGER MIFFLIN. \"Tell me,\" I said, \"does your Parnassus—my Parnassus, rather—contain everything I\u0027m likely to need? Is it stocked up with food and so on?\" \"I was coming to that,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll find a fair supply of stuff in the cupboard over the stove, though I used to get most of my meals at farmhouses along the road. I generally read aloud to people as I go along, and they\u0027re often good for a free meal. It\u0027s amazing how little most of the country folk know about books, and how pleased they are to hear good stuff. Down in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania....\" \"Well, how about the horse?\" I said hastily, seeing him about to embark on an anecdote. It wasn\u0027t far short of eleven o\u0027clock, and I was anxious to get started. \"It might be well to take along some oats. My supply\u0027s about exhausted.\" I filled a sack with oats in the stable and Mr. Mifflin showed me where to hang it under the van. Then in the kitchen I loaded a big basket with provisions for an emergency: a dozen eggs, a jar of sliced bacon, butter, cheese, condensed milk, tea, biscuits, jam, and two loaves of bread. These Mr. Mifflin stowed inside the van, Mrs. McNally watching in amazement. \"I tank this bane a queer picnic!\" she said. \"Which way are you going? Mr. McGill, is he coming after you?\" \"No,\" I insisted, \"he\u0027s not coming. I\u0027m going off on a holiday. You get dinner for him and he won\u0027t worry about anything until after that. Tell him I\u0027ve gone over to see Mrs. Collins.\" I climbed the little steps and entered my Parnassus with a pleasant thrill of ownership. The terrier on the bunk jumped to the floor with a friendly wag of the tail. I piled the bunk with bedding and blankets of my own, shook out the drawers which fitted above the bunk, and put into them what few belongings I was taking with me. And we were ready to start. Redbeard was already sitting in front with the reins in hand. I climbed up beside him. The front seat was broad but uncushioned, well sheltered by the peak of the van. I gave a quick glance around at the comfortable house under its elms and maples—saw the big, red barn shining in the sun and the pump under the grape arbour. I waved good-bye to Mrs. McNally who was watching us in silent amazement. Pegasus threw her solid weight against the traces and Parnassus swung round and rolled past the gate. We turned into the Redfield road. \"Here,\" said Mifflin, handing me the reins, \"you\u0027re skipper, you\u0027d better drive. Which way do you want to go?\" My breath came a little fast when I realized that my adventure had begun! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3212/87690.html","bookId":724,"book":{"id":724,"title":"Parnassus on Wheels","description":"简介： I wonder if there isn\u0027t a lot of bunkum in higher education?
