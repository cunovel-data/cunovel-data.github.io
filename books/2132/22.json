{"id":94570,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"The little creature scrambled over the rocks, descending the steep slope as if death itself were chasing it. With an outraged Wulfgar close behind, roaring in pain from his reopened shoulder wound, the goblin would\u0027ve had better odds against death. The trail ended at a fifteen-foot drop, but the goblin\u0027s run didn\u0027t end there as it leaped with hardly a thought. Landing with a thump and a rather sorry attempt at a roll, it got back up, bloody but still moving. Wulfgar didn\u0027t follow; he couldn\u0027t afford to take himself so far from the cave entrance where Morik was still battling. The barbarian skidded to a stop and searched about for a rock. Snatching one up, he heaved it at the fleeing goblin. He missed, the goblin too far away, but satisfied that it wouldn\u0027t return, Wulfgar turned and sprinted back to the cave. Long before he arrived there, though, he saw that the battle had ended. Morik was perched on a rock at the base of a jagged spur of stones, huffing and puffing. \"The little rats run fast,\" Morik remarked. Wulfgar nodded and fell into a sitting position on the ground. They had gone out to scout the pass earlier. Upon returning, they\u0027d found a dozen goblins determined to take the cave home as their own. Twelve against two-the goblins hadn\u0027t had a chance. Only one of the goblins was dead, one Wulfgar had caught first by the throat and squeezed. The others had been sent running to the four winds, and both men knew that none of the cowardly creatures would return for a long, long time. \"I did get its purse, if not its heart,\" Morik remarked holding up a little leather bag. He blew into his empty hand for luck (and also because the mountain wind whistled chilly this day) then emptied the bag, his eyes wide. Wulfgar, too, leaned in eagerly. A pair of silver pieces, several copper, and three shiny stones-not gemstones, just stones-tumbled out. \"Our luck that we did not encounter a merchant on the path,\" Wulfgar muttered sarcastically, \"for this is a richer haul by far.\" Morik flung the meager treasure to the ground. \"We still have plenty of gold from the raid on the coach in the west,\" he remarked. \"So nice to hear you admit it,\" came an unexpected voice from above. The pair looked up the rocky spur to see a man in flowing blue robes and holding a tall oaken staff staring down at them. \"I would hate to believe I\u0027d found the wrong thieves, after all.\" \"A wizard,\" Morik muttered with disgust, tensing. \"I hate wizards.\" The robed man lifted his staff and began chanting. Wulfgar moved quicker, skidding down to scoop a fair-sized stone, then coming up fast and launching it. His aim proved perfect. The rock crashed against the wizard\u0027s chest, though it harmlessly bounced away. If the man even noticed it, he showed no sign. \"I hate wizards!\" Morik yelled again, diving out of the way. Wulfgar started to move, but he was too late, for the lightning bolt firing from the staff clipped him and sent him flying. Up came Wulfgar, rolling and cursing, a rock in each hand. \"How many hits can you take?\" he cried to the wizard, letting fly one that narrowly missed. The second one went spinning into the obviously amused wizard\u0027s blocking arm and bounced away as surely as if it had hit solid stone. \"Does everybody in all of Faerun have access to a wizard?\" Morik cried, picking his trail from cover to cover as he tried to ascend the spur. Morik believed he could get away from, outwit, or outfight (particularly with Wulfgar beside him) any bounty hunter or warrior lord in the area. However, wizards were an entirely different manner, as he had learned so many painful times before, most recently in his capture on the streets of Luskan. \"How many can you take?\" Wulfgar yelled again, hurling another stone that also missed its mark. \"One!\" the wizard replied. \"I can take but one.\" \"Then hit him!\" Morik yelled to Wulfgar, misunderstanding. The wizard was not talking about taking hits on his magical stoneskin, but about taking prisoners. Even as Morik cried out, the robed man pointed at Wulfgar with his free hand. A black tendril shot from his extended fingers, snaking down the spur at tremendous speed to wrap around Wulfgar, binding him fast to the mage. \"I\u0027ll not leave the other unscathed!\" the wizard cried to no one present. He clenched his fist, his ring sparkled, and he stamped his staff on the stone. A blinding light, a puff of smoke, and Wulfgar and the mage were gone amid a thunder ous rumble along the spur. \"Wizards,\" Morik spat with utter contempt, just before the spur, with Morik halfway up it, collapsed. He was in the audience hall of a castle. The incessant black tendril continued to wrap him stubbornly in its grip, looping his torso several times, trying to pin his powerful arms. Wulfgar punched at it, but it was a pliable thing, and it merely bent under the blows, absorbing all the energy. He grabbed at the tendril, tried to twist and tear it, but even as his hands worked one area, the long end of the tendril, released from the wizard\u0027s hand, looped his legs and tripped him up, bringing him crashing to the hard floor. Wulfgar rolled and squirmed and wriggled to no avail. He was caught. The barbarian used his arms to keep the thing from wrapping his neck, and when he was at last sure that it could not harm him, he turned his attention more fully to the area around him. There stood the wizard before a pair of chairs, wherein sat a man in his mid-twenties and a younger, undeniably beautiful woman-a woman Wulfgar recognized all too well. Beside them stood an old man, and in a chair to the side sat a plump woman of perhaps forty winters. Wulfgar also noted that several soldiers lined the room, grim-faced and wellarmed. \"As I promised,\" the wizard said, bowing before the man on the throne. \"Now, if you please, there is the small matter of my payment.\" \"You will find the gold awaiting you in the quarters I provided,\" the man replied. \"I never doubted you, good sir. Your merchant mentor Galway recommended you most highly.\" The wizard bowed again. \"Are my services further required?\" he asked. \"How long will it last?\" the man asked, indicating the tendril holding Wulfgar. \"A long time,\" the wizard promised. \"Long enough for you to question and condemn him, certainly, then to drag him down to your dungeon or kill him where he lies.\" \"Then you may go. Will you dine with us this night?\" \"I fear that I have pressing business at the Hosttower,\" the wizard replied. \"Well met, Lord Feringal.\" He bowed again and walked out, chuckling as he passed the prone barbarian. To everyone\u0027s surprise, Wulfgar growled and grabbed the tendril in both hands and tore it apart. He had just managed to gain his feet, many voices screaming about him, when a dozen soldiers descended, pounding him with mailed fists and heavy clubs. Still fighting against the tendril, Wulfgar managed to free his hand for one punch, sending a soldier flying, and to grab another by the neck and slam him facedown on the floor. Wulfgar went down, dazed and battered. As the wizard magically dispelled the remnants of the tendril, the barbarian\u0027s arms were brought behind him and looped with heavy chains. \"If it were just me and you, wizard, would you have anything left with which to stop me?\" the stubborn barbarian growled. \"I would have killed you out in the mountains,\" snapped the mage, obviously embarrassed by the failure of his magic. Wulfgar launched a ball of spit that struck the man in the face. \"How many can you take?\" he asked. The enraged wizard began waggling his fingers, but before he could get far Wulfgar plowed through the ring of soldiers and shoulder-slammed the man, sending him flying away. The barbarian was subdued again almost immediately, but the shaken wizard climbed up from the floor and skittered out of the room. \"Impressive display,\" Lord Feringal said sarcastically, scowling. \"Am I to applaud you before I castrate you?\" That got Wulfgar\u0027s attention. He started to respond, but a guard slugged him to keep him quiet. Lord Feringal looked to the young woman seated beside him. \"Is this the man?\" he asked, venom in every word. Wulfgar stared hard at the woman, at the woman he had stopped Morik from harming on the road, at the woman he had released unscathed. He saw something there in her rich, green eyes, some emotion he could not quite fathom. Sorrow, perhaps? Certainly not anger. \"I ... don\u0027t think so,\" the woman said and looked away. Lord Feringal\u0027s eyes widened, indeed. The old man standing beside him gasped openly, as did the other woman. \"Look again, Meralda,\" Feringal commanded sharply. \"Is it him?\" No answer, and Wulfgar could clearly see the pain in the woman\u0027s eyes. \"Answer me!\" the lord of Auckney demanded. \"No!\" the woman cried, refusing to meet any gaze. \"Fetch Liam,\" Lord Feringal yelled. Behind Wulfgar, a soldier rushed out of the room, returning a moment later with an old gnome. \"Oh, be sure it is,\" the gnome said, coming around to stare Wulfgar right in the eye. \"You thinking I won\u0027t know you?\" he asked. \"You got me good, with your little rat friend distracting my eyes and you swinging down. I know you, thieving dog, for I seen you afore you hit me!\" He turned to Lord Feringal. \"Aye,\" he said. \"He\u0027s the one.\" Feringal eyed the woman beside him for a long, long time. \"You are certain?\" he asked Liam, his eyes still on the woman. \"I\u0027ve not been bested often, my lord,\" Liam replied. \"You\u0027ve named me as the finest fighter in Auckney, which\u0027s why you entrusted me with your lady. I failed you, and I\u0027m not taking that lightly. He\u0027s the one, I say, and oh, but what I\u0027d pay you to let me fight him fairly.\" He turned back and glared into Wulfgar\u0027s eyes. Wulfgar matched that stare, and though he had no doubt he could snap this gnome in half with hardly an effort, he said nothing. Wulfgar couldn\u0027t escape the fact that he had wronged the diminutive fellow. \"Have you anything to say for yourself?\" Lord Feringal asked Wulfgar. Before the barbarian could begin to reply, the young lord rushed forward, brushing Liam aside to stand very close. \"I have a dungeon for you,\" he whispered harshly. \"A dark place, filled with the waste and bones of the previous occupants. Filled with rats and biting spiders. Yes, fool, I have a place for you to fill until I decide the time has come to kill you most horribly.\" Wulfgar knew the procedure well by this point in his life and merely heaved a heavy sigh. He was promptly dragged away. In the corner of the audience hall, Steward Temigast watched it all very carefully, shifting his gaze from Wulfgar to Meralda and back again. He noted Priscilla, sitting quietly, no doubt taking it all in, as well. He noted the venom on Priscilla\u0027s face as she regarded Meralda. She was thinking that the woman had enjoyed being ravished by the barbarian, Temigast realized. She was thinking that, perhaps, it hadn\u0027t really been a rape. Given the size of the man, Temigast couldn\u0027t agree with that assessment. The cell was everything Lord Feringal had promised, a wretched, dark and damp place filled with the awful stench of death. Wulfgar couldn\u0027t see a thing, not his own hand if he held it an inch in front of his face. He scrabbled around in the mud and worse, pushing past sharp bones in a futile attempt to find some piece of dry ground upon which he might sit. And all the while he slapped at the spiders and other crawling things that scurried in to learn what new meal had been delivered to them. To most, this dungeon would have seemed worse than Luskan\u0027s prison tunnels, mostly because of its purest sense of emptiness and solitude, but Wulfgar feared neither rats nor spiders. His terrors ran much deeper than that. Here in the dark he found he was somewhat able to fend off those horrors. And so the day passed. Sometime during the next one, the barbarian awoke to torchlight and the sound of a guard slipping a plate of rotten food through the small slit in the half-barred, half-metal hatch that sealed the filthy burrow cell from the wet tunnels beyond. Wulfgar started to eat but spat it out, thinking he might be better off trying to catch and skin a rat. That second day a turmoil of emotions found the barbarian. Mostly he was angry at all the world. Perhaps he deserved punishment for his highwayman activities-he could accept responsibility for that-but this went beyond justice concerning his actions on the road with Lord Feringal\u0027s coach. Also, Wulfgar was angry at himself. Perhaps Morik had been right all along. Perhaps he did not have the heart for this life. A true highwayman would have let the gnome die or at least finished him quickly. A true highwayman would have taken his pleasures with the woman, then dragged her along either to be sold as a slave or kept as a slave of his own. Wulfgar laughed aloud. Yes, indeed, Morik had been right. Wulfgar hadn\u0027t the heart for any of it. Now here he was, the wretch of wretches, a failure at the lowest level of civilized society, a fool too incompetent to even be a proper highwayman. He spent the next hour not in his cell, but back in the Spine of the World, that great dividing line between who he once was and what he had become, that physical barrier that seemed such an appropriate symbol of the mental barrier within him, the wall he had thrown up like an emotional mountain range to hold back the painful memories of Errtu. In his mind\u0027s eye he was there now, sitting on the Spine of the World, staring out over Icewind Dale and the life he once knew, then turning around to face south and the miserable existence he now suffered. He kept his eyes closed, though he wouldn\u0027t have seen much in the dark anyway, ignored the many crawling things assaulting him, and got more than a few painful spider bites for his inattentiveness. Sometime later that day, a noise brought him from his trance. He opened his eyes to see the flickers of another torch in the tunnel beyond his door. \"Living still?\" came a question from the voice of an old man. Wulfgar shifted to his knees and crawled to the door, blinking repeatedly as his eyes adjusted to the light. After a few moments he recognized the man holding the torch as the advisor Wulfgar had seen in the audience hall, a man who physically reminded him of Magistrate Jharkheld of Luskan. Wulfgar snorted and squeezed one hand through the bars. \"Burn it with your torch,\" he offered. \"Take your perverted pleasures where you will find them.\" \"Angry that you were caught, I suppose,\" the man called Temigast replied. \"Twice imprisoned wrongly,\" Wulfgar replied. \"Are not all prisoners imprisoned wrongly by their own recounting?\" the steward asked. \"The woman said that it wasn\u0027t me.\" \"The woman suffered greatly,\" Temigast countered. \"Perhaps she cannot face the truth.\" \"Or perhaps she spoke correctly.\" \"No,\" Temigast said immediately, shaking his head. \"Liam remembered you clearly and would not be mistaken.\" Wulfgar snorted again. \"You deny that you were the thief who knocked over the carriage?\" Temigast asked bluntly. Wulfgar stared at him unblinking, but his expression spoke clearly that he did not deny the words. \"That alone would cost you your hands and imprison you for as many years as Lord Feringal decided was just,\" Temigast explained. \"Or that alone could cost you your life.\" \"Your driver, Liam, was injured,\" Wulfgar replied, his voice a growl. \"Accidentally. I could have let him die on the road. The girl was not harmed in any way.\" \"Why would she say differently?\" Temigast asked calmly. \"Did she?\" Wulfgar came back, and he tilted his head, beginning to catch on, beginning to understand why the young lord had been so completely outraged. At first he had thought mere pride to be the source-the man had failed to properly protect his wife, after all-but now, in retrospect, Wulfgar began to suspect there had been something even deeper there, some primal outrage. He remembered Lord Feringal\u0027s first words to him, a threat of castration. \"I pray that Lord Feringal has a most unpleasant death prepared for you, barbarian,\" Temigast remarked. \"You cannot know the agony you have brought to him, to Lady Meralda, or to the folk of Auckney. You are a scoundrel and a dog, and justice will be served when you die, whether in public execution or down here alone in the filth.\" \"You came down here just to deliver this news?\" Wulfgar asked sarcastically. Temigast struck him in the hand with the lit torch, forcing Wulfgar to quickly retract his arm. With that the old man turned and stormed away, leaving Wulfgar alone in the dark and with some very curious notions swirling about in his head. Despite his final outburst and genuine anger, Temigast didn\u0027t walk away with his mind made up about anything. He had gone to see the barbarian because of Meralda\u0027s reaction to the man in the audience hall, because he had to learn the truth. Now that truth, seemed fuzzier by far. Why wouldn\u0027t Meralda identify Wulfgar if she had, indeed, recognized him? How could she not? The man was remarkable, after all, being near to seven feet in height and with shoulders as broad as a young giant\u0027s. Priscilla was wrong, Temigast knew, for he recognized that she was thinking that Meralda had enjoyed the rape. \"Ridiculous,\" the steward muttered, verbalizing his thoughts that he might make some sense of them. \"Purely and utterly ridiculous. \"But would Meralda protect her rapist?\" he asked himself quietly. The answer hit him as clearly as the image of an idiotic young man slipping off a cliff.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-22.html","bookId":2132,"book":{"id":2132,"title":"The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2)","description":"Storyline: The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2) Spending time in the unimaginable torture chambers of the Abyss for even a day would be enough to break even the heartiest soul, and the barbarian Wulfgar was there for years.
