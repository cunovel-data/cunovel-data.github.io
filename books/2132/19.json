{"id":94567,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\"Our first customers,\" Morik announced. He and Wulfgar stood on a high ridge overlooking the pass into Icewind Dale. A pair of wagons rolled down the trail, headed for the break in the mountains, their pace steady but not frantic.\\n\\n \"Travelers or merchants?\" Wulfgar asked, unconvinced.\\n\\n \"Merchants, and with wealth aboard,\" the rogue replied. \"Their pace reveals them, and their lack of flanking guardsmen invites our presence.\"\\n\\n It seemed foolish to Wulfgar that merchants would make such a dangerous trek as this without a heavy escort of soldiers, but he didn\u0027t doubt Morik\u0027s words. On his own last journey from the dale beside his former friends, they had come upon a single merchant wagon, riding alone and vulnerable.\\n\\n \"Surprised?\" Morik asked, noting his expression.\\n\\n \"Idiots always surprise me,\" Wulfgar replied.\\n\\n \"They cannot afford the guards,\" Morik explained. \"Few who make the run to Icewind Dale can, and those who can usually take the safer, western pass. These are minor merchants, you see, trading pittances. Mostly they rely on good fortune, either in finding able warriors looking for a ride or an open trail to get them through.\"\\n\\n \"This seems too easy.\"\\n\\n \"It is easy!\" Morik replied enthusiastically. \"You understand, of course, that we are doing this caravan a favor.\" Wulfgar didn\u0027t appear convinced of that.\\n\\n \"Think of it,\" prompted the rogue. \"Had we not killed the giants, these merchants would likely have found boulders raining down on them,\" Morik explained. \"Not only would they be stripped of their wealth, but their skin would be stripped from their bones in a giant\u0027s cooking pot.\" He grinned. \"So do not fret, my large friend,\" he went on. \"All we want is their money, fair payment for the work we have done for them.\"\\n\\n Strangely, it made a bit of sense to Wulfgar. In that respect, the work to which Morik referred was no different than Wulfgar had been doing for many years with Drizzt and the others, the work of bringing justice to a wild land. The difference was that never before had he asked for payment, as Morik was obviously thinking to do now.\\n\\n \"Our easiest course would be to show them our power without engaging,\" the rogue explained. \"Demand a tithe in payment for our efforts, some supplies and a perhaps a bit of gold, then let them go on their way. With only two wagons, though, and no other guards evident, we might be able to just knock them off completely, a fine haul, if done right, with no witnesses.\" His smile as he explained that latter course disappeared when he noted Wulfgar\u0027s frown.\\n\\n \"A tithe then, no more,\" Morik compromised. \"Rightful payment for our work on the road.\"\\n\\n Even that sat badly with the barbarian, but he nodded his head in agreement.\\n\\n He picked a section of trail littered with rocks where the wagons would have to slow considerably or risk losing a wheel or a horse. A single tree on the left side of the trail provided Wulfgar with the prop he would need to carry out his part of the attack, if it came to that.\\n\\n Morik waited in clear view along the trail as the pair of wagons came bouncing along.\\n\\n \"Greetings!\" he called, moving to the center of the trail, his arms held high. Morik shrank back just a bit, seeing the man on the bench seat beside the driver lifting a rather large crossbow his way. Still, he couldn\u0027t back up too much, for he had to get the wagon to stop on the appropriate mark.\\n\\n \"Out o\u0027 the road, or I\u0027ll shoot ye dead!\" the crossbowman yelled.\\n\\n In response, Morik reached down and lifted a huge head, the head of a slain giant, into the air. \"That would be ill-advised,\" he replied, \"both morally and physically.\"\\n\\n The wagon bounced to a stop, forcing the one behind it to stop as well.\\n\\n Morik used his foot, nearly straining his knee in the process, to move a second severed giant head out from behind a rock \"I am happy to inform you that the trail ahead is now clear.\"\\n\\n \"Then get outta me way,\" the driver of the first wagon replied, \"or he\u0027ll shoot ye down, and I\u0027ll run ye into ruts.\"\\n\\n Morik chuckled and moved aside the pack he had lain on the trail, revealing the third giant head. Despite their bravado, he saw that those witnessing the spectacle of the heads were more than a little impressed-and afraid. Any man who could defeat three giants was not one to take lightly.\\n\\n \"My friends and I have worked hard all the week to clear the trail,\" Morik explained.\\n\\n \"Friends?\"\\n\\n \"You think I did this alone?\" Morik said with a laugh. \"You flatter me. No, I had the help of many friends.\" Morik cast his gaze about the rocky outcroppings of the pass as if acknowledging his countless \"friends.\" \"You must forgive them, for they are shy.\"\\n\\n \"Ride on!\" came a cry from inside the wagon, and the two men on the bench seat looked at each other.\\n\\n \"Yer friends hide like thieves,\" the driver yelled at Morik. \"Clear the way!\"\\n\\n \"Thieves?\" Morik echoed incredulously. \"You would be dead already, squashed flat under a giant\u0027s boulder, were it not for us.\"\\n\\n The wagon door creaked open and an older man leaned out standing with one foot inside and the other on the running board. \"You\u0027re demanding payment for your actions,\" he remarked, obviously knowing this routine all too well (as did most merchants of the northern stretches of Faerun).\\n\\n \"Demand is such a nasty word,\" Morik replied.\\n\\n \"Nasty as your game, little thief,\" the merchant replied.\\n\\n Morik narrowed his eyes threateningly and glanced pointedly down at the three giant heads.\\n\\n \"Very well, then,\" the merchant conceded. \"What is the price of your heroism?\"\\n\\n \"We need supplies that we might maintain our vigil and keep the pass safe,\" Morik explained reasonably. \"And a bit of gold, perhaps, as a reward for our efforts.\" It was the merchant\u0027s turn to scowl. \"To pay the widows of those who did not survive our raid on the giant clan,\" Morik improvised.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d hardly call three a clan,\" the merchant replied dryly, \"but I\u0027ll not diminish your efforts. I offer you and your hiding friends a fine meal, and if you agree to accompany us to Luskan as guards, I will pay each of you a gold piece a day,\" the merchant added, proud of his largesse and obviously pleased with himself for having turned the situation to his advantage.\\n\\n Morik\u0027s eyes narrowed at the weak offer. \"We have no desire to return to Luskan at this time.\"\\n\\n \"Then take your meal and be happy with that,\" came the curt response.\\n\\n \"Idiot,\" Morik remarked under his breath. Aloud he countered the merchant\u0027s offer. \"We will accept no less than fifty gold pieces and enough food for three fine meals for seven men.\"\\n\\n The merchant laughed. \"You will accept our willingness to let you walk away with your life,\" he said. He snapped his fingers, and a pair of men leaped from the second wagon, swords drawn. The driver of that wagon drew his as well.\\n\\n \"Now be gone!\" he finished, and he disappeared back into the coach. \"Run him down,\" he cried to his driver.\\n\\n \"Idiots!\" Morik screamed, the cue for Wulfgar.\\n\\n The driver hesitated, and that cost him. Holding the end of a strong rope, Wulfgar leaped from his concealment along the lefthand rock wall and swooped in a pendulum arc with a bloodcurdling howl. The crossbowman spun and fired but missed badly. Wulfgar barreled in at full speed, letting go of the rope and swinging his mighty arms out wide to sweep both crossbowman and driver from the bench, landing atop them in a pile on the far side. An elbow to the face laid the driver low. Reversing his swing, Wulfgar slammed the crossbowman on the jaw, surely breaking it as blood gushed forth.\\n\\n The three swordsmen from the trailing wagon came on, two to the left of the first wagon, the third going to the right. Morik went right, a long and slender sword in one hand, a dagger in the other, intercepting the man before he could get to Wulfgar.\\n\\n The man came at the rogue in a straightforward manner. Morik put his sword out beside the thrusting blade but rolled it about, disengaging. He stepped ahead, looping his dagger over the man\u0027s sword and pulling it harmlessly aside while he countered with a thrust of his own sword, heading for the man\u0027s throat. He had him dead, or would have, except that Morik\u0027s arm was stopped as surely as if he were trying to poke his sword through solid stone.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" he demanded of Wulfgar as the barbarian stepped up and slugged the guard, nearly losing his ear to the thrashing sword and dagger. The man got his free hand up to block, but Wulfgar\u0027s heavy punch went right through the defense, planting his fist and the man\u0027s own forearm into his face and launching him away. But it was a short-lived victory.\\n\\n Though staggered by Wulfgar\u0027s elbow, the driver was up again with blade in hand. Worse still, the other two swordsmen had found strong positions, one atop the bench, the other in front of the wagon. If that weren\u0027t bad enough, the merchant burst from the door, a wand in hand.\\n\\n \"Now we are the idiots!\" Morik yelled to Wulfgar, cursing and spinning out from the attack of the swordsman on the bench. From the man\u0027s one thrust-and-cut routine, Morik could tell that this one was no novice to battle.\\n\\n Wulfgar went for the merchant. Suddenly he was flying backward, his hair dancing on end, his heart palpitating wildly.\\n\\n \"So that\u0027s what the wand does,\" Morik remarked after the flash. \"I hate wizards.\"\\n\\n He went at the swordsman on the ground, who defeated his initial attempt at a quick kill with a circular parry that almost had the rogue overbalancing. \"Do hurry back!\" Morik called to Wulfgar, then he ducked and thrust his sword up frantically as the swordsman from the bench leaped atop the horse team and stabbed at his head.\\n\\n The driver came at Wulfgar, as did the man he had just slugged, and the barbarian worked fast to get the hammer off his back. He started to meet the driver\u0027s charge but stopped fast and reversed his grip and direction, spinning the hammer the merchant\u0027s way instead, having no desire to absorb another lightning bolt.\\n\\n The hammer hit the mark perfectly, not on the merchant, but against the coach door, slamming it on the man\u0027s extended arm just as he was about to loose yet another blast. Fire he did, though, a sizzling bolt that just missed the other man rushing Wulfgar.\\n\\n \"All charge!\" Morik called, looking back to the rocky cliff on the left. The bluff turned his opponents\u0027 heads for just an instant. When they turned back, they found the rogue in full flight, and Morik was a fast runner indeed when his life was on the line.\\n\\n The driver came in hesitantly, respectful of Wulfgar\u0027s strength. The other man, though, charged right in, until the barbarian turned toward him with a leap and a great bellow. Wulfgar reversed direction almost immediately, going back for the driver, catching the man by surprise with his uncanny agility. He accepted a stinging cut along the arm in exchange for grabbing the man\u0027s weapon hand. Pulling him close with a great tug, Wulfgar bent low, clamped his free hand on the man\u0027s belt, and hoisted the flailing fool high over his head. A turn and a throw sent the driver hard into his charging companion.\\n\\n Wulfgar paused, to note Morik skittering by in full flight. A reasonable choice, given the course of the battle, but the barbarian\u0027s blood was up, and he turned back to the wagons and the two swordsmen, just in time to get hammered by another lightning stroke. With his long legs, Wulfgar passed Morik within fifty yards up the rocky climb.\\n\\n Another bolt slammed in near to the pair, splintering rocks.\\n\\n A crossbow quarrel followed soon after, accompanied by taunts and threats, but there came no pursuit, and soon the pair were running up high along the cliffs. When they dared to stop and catch their breath, Wulfgar looked down at the two scars on his tunic, shaking his head.\\n\\n \"We would have won if you had gone straight for the merchant after your sweep of the driver and crossbowman as planned,\" Morik scolded.\\n\\n \"And you would have cut out that man\u0027s throat,\" charged Wulfgar.\\n\\n Morik scowled. \"What of it? If you\u0027ve not the heart for this life, then why are we out here?\"\\n\\n \"Because you chose to deal with murderers in Luskan,\" Wulfgar reminded him, and they shared icy stares. Morik put his hand on his blade, thinking that the big man might attack him.\\n\\n Wulfgar thought about doing just that.\\n\\n They walked back to the cave separately. Morik beat him there and started in. Wulfgar changed his mind and stayed outside, moving to a small stream nearby where he could better tend his wounds. He found that his chest wasn\u0027t badly scarred, just the hair burned away from what was a minor lightning strike. However, his shoulder wound had reopened rather seriously. Only then, with his heavy tunic off, did the barbarian understand how much blood he had lost.\\n\\n Morik found him out there several hours later, passed out on a flat rock. He roused the barbarian with a nudge. \"We did not fare well,\" the rogue remarked, holding up a pair of bottles, \"but we are alive, and that is cause for celebration.\"\\n\\n \"We need cause?\" Wulfgar replied, not smiling, and he turned away.\\n\\n \"First attacks are always disastrous,\" Morik explained reasonably. \"We must become accustomed to each other\u0027s fighting style, is all.\"\\n\\n Wulfgar considered the words in light of his own experience, in light of the first true battle he and Drizzt had seen together. True, at one point, he had almost clobbered the drow with a low throw of Aegis-fang, but from the start there had been a symbiosis with Drizzt, a joining of heart that had brought them to a joining of battle routines. Could he say the same with Morik? Would he ever be able to?\\n\\n Wulfgar looked back at the rogue, who was smiling and holding out the bottles of potent liquor. Yes, he would come to terms with Morik. They would become of like heart and soul. Perhaps that was what bothered Wulfgar most of all.\\n\\n \"The past no longer exists, and the future does not yet exist,\" Morik reasoned. \"So live in the present and enjoy it, my friend. Enjoy every moment.\"\\n\\n Wulfgar considered the words, a common mantra for many of those living day-to-day on the streets. He took the bottle. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-19.html","bookId":2132,"book":{"id":2132,"title":"The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2)","description":"Storyline: The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2) \\n Spending time in the unimaginable torture chambers of the Abyss for even a day would be enough to break even the heartiest soul, and the barbarian Wulfgar was there for years.
