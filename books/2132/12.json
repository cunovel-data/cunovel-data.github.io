{"id":94560,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"You will tell me of the poison,\" said Prelate Vohltin, an associate of Camerbunne. He was sitting in a comfortable chair in the middle of the brutally hot room, his frame outlined by the glow of the huge, blazing hearth behind him. \"Never good,\" Morik replied, drawing another twist of the thumbscrew from the bulky, sadistic, one-eyed (and he didn\u0027t even bother to wear an eyepatch) gaoler. This one had more orcish blood than human. \"Poison, I mean,\" the rogue clarified, his voice going tight as waves of agony shot up his arm. \"It was not the same as the poison in the vial,\" Vohltin explained, and he nodded to the gaoler, who walked around the back of Morik. The rogue tried to follow the half-orc\u0027s movements, but both his arms were pulled outright, shackled tight at the wrists. One hand was in a press, the other in a framework box of strange design, its panels holding the hand open, fingers extended so that the gaoler could \"play\" with them one at a time. The prelate shrugged, held his hands up, and when Morik didn\u0027t immediately reply a cat-o\u0027-nine-tails switched across the rogue\u0027s naked back, leaving deep lines that hurt all the more for the sweat. \"You had the poison,\" Vohltin logically asserted, \"and the insidious weapons, but it was not the same poison in the vial we recovered. A clever ruse, I suspect, to throw us off the correct path in trying to heal Captain Deudermont\u0027s wounds.\" \"A ruse indeed,\" Morik said dryly. The gaoler hit him again with the whip and raised his arm for a third strike. However, Vohltin raised his arm to hold the brutal thug at bay. \"You admit it?\" Vohltin asked. \"All of it,\" Morik replied. \"A ruse perpetrated by someone else, delivering to me and Wulfgar what you consider the evidence against us, then striking out at Deudermont when he came over to speak-\" \"Enough!\" said an obviously frustrated Vohltin, for he and all of the other interrogators had heard the same nonsense over and over from both Morik and Wulfgar. The prelate rose and turned to leave, shaking his head. Morik knew what that meant. \"I can tell you other things,\" the rogue pleaded, but Vohltin just lifted his arm and waved his hand dismissively. Morik started to speak out again, but he lost his words and his breath as the gaoler slugged him hard in the kidney. Morik yelped and jumped, which only made the pain in his hand and thumb all the more exquisite. Still, despite all self-control, he jumped again when the gaoler struck him another blow, for the thug was wearing a metal strip across his knuckles, inlaid with several small pins. Morik thought of his drow visitors that night long ago in the small apartment he kept near the Cutlass. Did they know what was happening? Would they come and rescue Wulfgar, and if they did, would they rescue Morik as well? He had almost told Wulfgar about them in those first hours when they had been chained in the same room, hesitating only because he feared that Wulfgar, so obviously lost in agonizing memories, wouldn\u0027t even hear him and that somebody else might. Wouldn\u0027t it be wonderful if the magistrates could pin on him, as well a charge that he was an associate of dark elves? Not that it mattered. Another punch slammed in, then the gaoler wont for the whip again to cut a few new lines on his back. If those drow didn\u0027t come, his fate, Morik knew, was sealed in a most painful way. Robillard had only been gone for a few minutes, but when he returned to Deudermont\u0027s room he found half a dozen priests working furiously on the captain. Camerbunne stood back, directing the group. \"He is on fire inside,\" the priest explained, and even from this distance Robillard could see the truth of that statement from the color of the feverish Deudermont and the great streaks of sweat that trailed down his face. Robillard noticed, too, that the room was growing colder, and he realized that a pair of the six working on Deudermont were casting spells, not to heal, but to create cold. \"I have spells that will do the same,\" Robillard offered. \"Powerful spells on scrolls back at Sea Sprite. Perhaps my captain would be better served if your priests were able to focus on healing.\" \"Run,\" Camerbunne said, and Robillard did him one better, using a series of dimensional doors to get back to Sea Sprite in a matter of moments. The wizard fished through his many components and scroll tubes, magical items and finely crafted pieces he meant to enchant when he found the time, at last coming upon a scroll with a trio of spells for creating ice, along with the necessary components. Cursing himself for not being better prepared and vowing that he would devote all his magical energies the next day to memorizing such spells, Robillard gated back to the chamber in the chapel. The priests were still working frenetically, and the old herb woman was there as well, rubbing a creamy, white salve all over Deudermont\u0027s wet chest. Robillard prepared the components-a vial of ice troll blood, a bit of fur from the great white bear-and unrolled the scroll, flattening it on a small table. He tore his gaze from the dying Deudermont, focusing on the task at hand, and with the discipline only a wizard might know he methodically went to work, chanting softly and waggling his fingers and hands. He poured the cold ice troll blood on his thumb and index finger, then clasped the fur between them and blew onto it, once, twice, thrice, then cast the fur to the floor along a bare wall at the side of the room. A tap-tapping began there, hail bouncing off the floor, louder as the chunks came larger and larger, until, within a matter of seconds, Captain Deudermont was laid upon a new bed, a block of ice. \"This is the critical hour,\" Camerbunne explained. \"His fever is too great, and I fear he may die of it. Blood as thin as water pours from his orifices. I have more priests waiting to step in when this group has exhausted their healing spells, and I have sent several to other chapels, even of rival gods, begging aid.\" Camerbunne smiled at the wizard\u0027s surprised expression. \"They will come,\" he assured Robillard. \"All of them.\" Robillard was not a religious man, mainly because in his days of trying to find a god that fit his heart, he found himself distressed at the constant bickering and rivalries of the many varied churches. So he understood the compliment Camerbunne had just paid to the captain. What a great reputation Deudermont had built among the honest folk of the northern Sword Coast that all would put aside rivalries and animosity to join in for his sake. They did come as Camerbunne promised, priests of nearly every persuasion in Luskan, flocking in six at a time to expend their healing energies over the battered captain. Deudermont\u0027s fever broke around midnight. He opened a weary eye to find Robillard asleep next to him. The wizard\u0027s head was cradled on his folded arms on the captain\u0027s small bed, next to Deudermont\u0027s side. \"How many days?\" the weak captain asked, for he recognized that something was very wrong here, very strange, as if he had just awakened from a long and terrible nightmare. Also, though he was wrapped in a sheet, he knew that he was on no normal bed, for it was too hard and his backside was wet. Robillard jumped up at the sound, eyes wide. He put his hand to Deudermont\u0027s forehead, and his smile widened considerably when he felt that the man was cool to the touch. \"Camerbunne!\" he called, drawing a curious look from the confused captain. It was the most beautiful sight Robillard had ever seen. \"Three circuits,\" came the nasally voice of Jharkheld the Magistrate, a thin old wretch who took far too much pleasure in his tasks for Morik\u0027s liking. Every day the man walked through the dungeon caverns, pointing out those whose time had come for Prisoner\u0027s Carnival and declaring, based on the severity of their crime, or, perhaps, merely from his own mood, the preparation period for each. A \"circuit,\" according to the gaoler who regularly beat Morik, was the time it took for a slow walk around the plaza where the Prisoner\u0027s Carnival was held, roughly about ten minutes. So the man Jharkheld had just labeled for three circuits would be brought up to carnival and tortured by various nonmortal means for about half an hour before Jharkheld even began the public hearing. It was done to rouse the crowd, Morik understood, and the old wretch Jharkheld liked the hearty cheers. \"So you have come to beat me again,\" Morik said when the brutish gaoler walked into the natural stone chamber where the rogue was chained to the wall. \"Have you brought the holy man with you? Or the magistrate, perhaps? Is he to join us to order me up to the carnival?\" \"No beatin\u0027 today, Morik the Rogue,\" the gaoler said. \"They\u0027re not wantin\u0027 anything more from ye. Captain Deudermont\u0027s not needin\u0027 ye anymore.\" \"He died?\" Morik asked, and he couldn\u0027t mask a bit of concern in his tone. If Deudermont had died, the charge against Wulfgar and Morik would be heinous murder, and Morik had been around Luskan long enough to witness more than a few executions of people so charged, executions by torture that lasted the better part of a day, at least. \"Nah,\" the gaoler said with obvious sadness in his tone. \"Nah, we\u0027re not so lucky. Deudermont\u0027s livin\u0027 and all the better, so it looks like yerself and Wulfgar\u0027ll get killed quick and easy.\" \"Oh, joy,\" said Morik. The brute paused for a moment and looked around, then waded in close to Morik and hit him a series of wicked blows about the stomach and chest. \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 that Magistrate Jharkheld\u0027ll be callin\u0027 ye up to carnival soon enough,\" the gaoler explained. \"Wanted to get in a few partin\u0027s, is all.\" \"My thanks,\" the ever-sarcastic rogue replied, and that got him a left hook across the jaw that knocked out a tooth and filled his mouth with warm blood. Deudermont\u0027s strength was fast returning, so much so that the priests had a very difficult task in keeping the man in his bed. Still they prayed over him, offering spells of healing, and the old herbalist woman came in with pots of tea and another soothing salve. \"It could not have been Wulfgar,\" Deudermont protested to Robillard, who had told him the entire story since the near tragedy in front of the Cutlass. \"Wulfgar and Morik,\" Robillard said firmly. \"I watched it, Captain, and a good thing for you that I was watching!\" \"It makes no sense to me,\" Deudermont replied. \"I know Wulfgar.\" \"Knew,\" Robillard corrected. \"But he is a friend of Drizzt and Catti-brie, and we both know that those two would have nothing to do with an assassin-nothing good, at least.\" \"Was a friend,\" Robillard stubbornly corrected. \"Now Wulfgar makes friends the likes of Morik the Rogue, a notorious street thug, and another pair, I believe, worse by far.\" \"Another pair?\" Deudermont asked, and even as he did, Waillan Micanty and another crewman from Sea Sprite entered the room. They went to the captain first, bowed and saluted, both smiling widely, for Deudermont seemed even better than he had earlier in the day when all the crew had come running to Robillard\u0027s joyous call. \"Have you found them?\" the wizard asked impatiently. \"I believe we have,\" a smug-looking Waillan replied. \"Hiding in the hold of a boat just two berths down from Sea Sprite.\" \"They haven\u0027t come out much of late,\" the other crewman offered, \"but we talked to some men at the Cutlass who thought they knew the pair and claimed that the one-eyed sailor was dropping gold coins without regard.\" Robillard nodded knowingly. So it was a contracted attack, and those two were a part of the plan. \"With your permission, Captain,\" the wizard said, \"I should like to take Sea Sprite out of dock.\" Deudermont looked at him curiously, for the captain had no idea what this talk might be about. \"I sent Mister Micanty on a search for two other accomplices in the attack against you,\" Robillard explained. \"It appears that we may have located them.\" \"But Mister Micanty just said they were in port,\" Deudermont reasoned. \"They\u0027re aboard Bowlegged Lady, as paying passengers. When I put Sea Sprite behind them, all weapons to bear, they will likely turn the pair over without a fight,\" Robillard reasoned, his eyes aglow. Now Deudermont managed a chuckle. \"I only wish that I could go with you,\" he said. The three took that as their cue and turned immediately for the door. \"What of Magistrate Jharkheld?\" Deudermont asked quickly before they could skitter away. \"I bade him to hold on the justice for the pair,\" Robillard replied, \"as you requested. We shall need them to confirm that these newest two were in on the attack, as well.\" Deudermont nodded and waved the trio away, falling into his own thoughts. He still didn\u0027t believe that Wulfgar could be involved, though he had no idea how he might prove it. In Luskan, as in most of the cities of Faerun, even the appearance of criminal activity could get a man hanged, or drawn and quartered, or whatever unpleasant manner of death the presiding magistrate could think up. \"An honest trader, I be, and ye got no proof otherways,\" Captain Pinnickers of Bowlegged Lady declared, leaning over the taffrail and calling out protests against the appearance of the imposing Sea Sprite, catapult and ballista and ranks of archers trained on his decks. \"As I have already told you, Captain Pinnickers, we have come not for your ship, nor for you, but for a pair you harbor,\" Robillard answered with all due respect. \"Bah! Go away with ye, or I\u0027ll be callin\u0027 out the city guard!\" the tough, old sea dog declared. \"No difficult task,\" Robillard replied smugly, and he motioned to the wharves beside Bowlegged Lady. Captain Pinnickers turned to see a hundred city soldiers or more lining the dock, grim-faced and armed for battle. \"You have nowhere to run or hide,\" Robillard explained. \"I ask your permission one more time as a courtesy to you. For your own sake, allow me and my crew to board your ship and find the pair we seek.\" \"My ship!\" Pinnicker said, poking a finger into his chest. \"Or I shall order my gunners to have at it,\" Robillard explained, standing tall and imposing at Sea Sprite\u0027s rail, all pretense of politeness flown. \"I shall join in with spells of destruction you cannot even begin to imagine. Then we will search the wreckage for the pair ourselves.\" Pinnicker seemed to shrink back just a bit, but he held fast his grim and determined visage. \"I offer you the choice one last time,\" Robillard said, his mock politeness returning. \"Fine choice,\" Pinnicker grumbled. He gave a helpless little wave, indicating that Robillard and the others should cross to his deck. They found Creeps Sharky and Tee-a-nicknick in short order, with Robillard easily identifying them. They also found an interesting item on a beam near the tattooed man-creature: a hollow tube. \"Blowgun,\" Waillan Micanty explained, presenting it to Robillard. \"Indeed,\" said the wizard, examining the exotic weapon and quickly confirming its use from the design. \"What might someone shoot from it?\" \"Something small with an end shaped to fill the tube,\" Micanty explained. He took the weapon hack, pursed his lips, and blew through the tube. \"It wouldn\u0027t work well if too much wind escaped around the dart.\" \"Small, you say. Like a cat\u0027s claw?\" Robillard asked, eyeing the captured pair. \"With a pliable, feathered end?\" Following Robillard\u0027s gaze at the miserable prisoners, Waillan Micanty nodded grimly. Wulfgar was lost somewhere far beyond pain, hanging limply from his shackled wrists, both bloody and torn. The muscles on the back of his neck and shoulders had long ago knotted, and even if he had been released and dropped to the floor, only gravity would have changed his posture. The pain had pushed too far and too hard and had released Wulfgar from his present prison. Unfortunately for the big man, that escape had only taken him to another prison, a darker place by far, with torments beyond anything these mortal men could inflict upon him. Tempting, naked, and wickedly beautiful succubi flew about him. The great pincer-armed glabrezu came at him repeatedly, snapping, snapping, nipping pieces of his body away. All the while he heard the demonic laughter of Errtu the conqueror. Errtu the great balor who hated Drizzt Do\u0027Urden above all other mortals and played out that anger continually upon Wulfgar. \"Wulfgar?\" The call came from far away, not a throaty, demonic voice like Errtu\u0027s, but gentle and soft. Wulfgar knew the trap, the false hopes, the feigned friendship. Errtu had played this one on him countless times, finding him in his moments of despair, lifting him from the emotional valleys, then dropping him even deeper into the pit of black hopelessness. \"I have spoken with Morik,\" the voice went on, but Wulfgar was no longer listening. \"He claims innocence,\" Captain Deudermont stubbornly continued, despite Robillard\u0027s huffing doubts at his side. \"Yet the dog Sharky has implicated you both.\" Trying to ignore the words, Wulfgar let out a low growl, certain that it was Errtu come again to torment him. \"Wulfgar?\" Deudermont asked. \"It is useless,\" Robillard said flatly. \"Give me something, my friend,\" Deudermont went on, leaning heavily on a cane for support, for his strength had far from returned. \"Some word that you are innocent so that I might tell Magistrate Jharkheld to release you.\" No response came back other than the continued growl. \"Just tell me the truth,\" Deudermont prodded. \"I don\u0027t believe that you were involved, but I must hear it from you if I am to demand a proper trial.\" \"He can\u0027t answer you, Captain,\" Robillard said, \"because I here is no truth to tell that will exonerate him.\" \"You heard Morik,\" Deudermont replied, for the two had just come from Morik\u0027s cell, where the little thief had vehemently proclaimed his and Wulfgar\u0027s innocence. He explained that Creeps Sharky had offered quite a treasure for Deudermont\u0027s head, but that he and Wulfgar had flatly refused. \"I heard a desperate man weave a desperate tale,\" Robillard replied. \"We could find a priest to interrogate him,\" Deudermont said. \"Many of them have spells to detect such lies.\" \"Not allowed by Luskan law,\" Robillard replied. \"Too many priests bring their own agendas to the interrogation. The magistrate handles his questioning in his own rather successful manner.\" \"He tortures them until they admit guilt, whether or not the admission is true,\" Deudermont supplied. Robillard shrugged. \"He gets results.\" \"He fills his carnival.\" \"How many of those in the carnival do you believe to be innocent, Captain?\" Robillard asked bluntly. \"Even those innocent, of the particular crime for which they are being punished have no doubt committed many other atrocities.\" \"That is a rather cynical view of justice, my friend,\" Deudermont said. That is reality,\" Robillard answered. Deudermont sighed and looked back to Wulfgar, hanging and growling, not proclaiming his innocence, not proclaiming anything at all. Deudermont called to the man again, even moved over and tapped him on the side. \"You must give me a reason to believe Morik,\" he said. Wulfgar felt the gentle touch of a succubus luring him into emotional hell. With a roar, he swung his hips and kicked out, just grazing the surprised captain, but clipping him hard enough to send him staggering backward to the floor. Robillard sent a ball of sticky goo from his wand, aiming low to pin Wulfgar\u0027s legs against the wall. The big man thrashed wildly, but with his wrists firmly chained and his legs stuck fast to the wall, the movement did little but reinvigorate the agony in his shoulders. Robillard was before him, hissing and sneering, whispering some chant. The wizard reached up, grabbed Wulfgar\u0027s groin, and sent a shock of electricity surging into the big man that brought a howl of pain. \"No!\" said Deudermont, struggling to his feet. \"No more.\" Robillard gave a sharp twist and spun away, his face contorted with outrage. \"Do you need more proof, Captain?\" he demanded. Deudermont wanted to offer a retort but found none. \"Let us leave this place,\" he said. \"Better that we had never come,\" Robillard muttered. Wulfgar was alone again, hanging easier until Robillard\u0027s wand material dissipated, for the goo supported his weight. Soon enough, though, he was hanging by just the shackles again, his muscles bunching in renewed pain. He fell away, deeper and darker than ever before. He wanted a bottle to crawl into, needed the burning liquid to release his mind from the torments.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-12.html","bookId":2132,"book":{"id":2132,"title":"The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2)","description":"Storyline: The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2) Spending time in the unimaginable torture chambers of the Abyss for even a day would be enough to break even the heartiest soul, and the barbarian Wulfgar was there for years.
