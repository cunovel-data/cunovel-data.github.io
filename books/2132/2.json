{"id":94550,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Part 1\\n\\n THE PRESENT\\n\\n In my homeland of Menzoberranzan, where demons play and drow revel at the horrible demise of rivals, there remains a state of necessary alertness and wariness. A drow off-guard is a drow murdered in Menzoberranzan, and thus few are the times when dark elves engage in exotic weeds or drinks that dull the senses.\\n\\n Few, but there are exceptions. At the final ceremony of Melee-Magthere, the school of fighters that I attended, graduated students engage in an orgy of mind-blurring herbs and sensual pleasures with the females of Arach-Tinilith, a moment of the purest hedonism, a party of the purest pleasures without regard to future implications.\\n\\n I rejected that orgy, though I knew not why at the time. It assaulted my sense of morality, I believed (and still do), and cheapened so many things that I hold precious. Now, in retrospect, I have come to understand another truth about myself that forced rejection of that orgy. Aside from the moral implications, and there were many, the mere notion of the mind-blurring herbs frightened and repulsed me. I knew that all along, of course as soon as I felt the intoxication at that ceremony, I instinctively rebelled against it but it wasn\u0027t until very recently that I came to understand the truth of that rejection, the real reason why such influences have no place in my life.\\n\\n These herbs attack the body in various ways, of course, from slowing reflexes to destroying coordination altogether, but more importantly, they attack the spirit in two different ways. First, they blur the past, erasing memories pleasant and unpleasant, and second, they eliminate any thoughts of the future. Intoxicants lock the imbiber in the present, the here and now, without regard for the future, without consideration of the past. That is the trap, a defeatist perspective that allows for attempted satiation of physical pleasures wantonly, recklessly. An intoxicated person will attempt even foolhardy dares because that inner guidance, even to the point of survival instinct itself, can be so impaired. How many young warriors foolishly throw themselves against greater enemies, only to be slain? How many young women find themselves with child, conceived with lovers they would not even consider as future husbands?\\n\\n That is the trap, the defeatist perspective, that I cannot tolerate. I live my life with hope, always hope, that the future will be better than the present, but only as long as I work to make it so. Thus, with that toil, comes the satisfaction in life, the sense of accomplishment we all truly need for real joy. How could I remain honest to that hope if I allowed myself a moment of weakness that could well destroy all I have worked to achieve and all I hope to achieve? How might I have reacted to so many unexpected crises if, at the time of occurrence, I was influenced by a mind-altering substance, one that impaired my judgment or altered my perspective?\\n\\n Also, the dangers of where such substances might lead cannot be underestimated. Had I allowed myself to be carried away with the mood of the graduation ceremony of Melee-Magthere, had I allowed myself the sensual pleasures offered by the priestesses, how cheapened might any honest encounter of love have been?\\n\\n Greatly, to my way of thinking. Sensual pleasures are, or should be, the culmination of physical desires combined with an intellectual and emotional decision, a giving of oneself, body and spirit, in a bond of trust and respect. In such a manner as that graduation ceremony, no such sharing could have occurred; it would have been a giving of body only, and more so than that, a taking of another\u0027s offered wares. There would have been no higher joining, no spiritual experience, and thus, no true joy.\\n\\n I cannot live in such a hopeless basking as that, for that is what it is: a pitiful basking in the lower, base levels of existence brought on, I believe, by the lack of hope for a higher level of existence.\\n\\n And so I reject all but the most moderate use of such intoxicants, and while I\u0027ll not openly judge those who so indulge, I will pity them their empty souls.\\n\\n What is it that drives a person to such depths? Pain, I believe, and memories too wretched to be openly faced and handled. Intoxicants can, indeed, blur the pains of the past at the expense of the future. But it is not an even trade.\\n\\n With that in mind, I fear for Wulfgar, my lost friend. Where will he find escape from the torments of his enslavement?\\n\\n Chapter 1 INTO PORT\\n\\n \"I do so hate this place,\" remarked Robillard, the robed wizard. He was speaking to Captain Deudermont of Sea Sprite as the three-masted schooner rounded a long jettie and came in sight of the harbor of the northern port of Luskan.\\n\\n Deudermont, a tall and stately man, mannered as a lord and with a calm, pensive demeanor, merely nodded at his wizard\u0027s proclamation. He had heard it all before, and many times. He looked to the city skyline and noted the distinctive structure of the Hosttower of the Arcane, the famed wizards\u0027 guild of Luskan. That, Deudermont knew, was the source of Robillard\u0027s sneering attitude concerning this port, though the wizard had been sketchy in his explanations, making a few offhand remarks about the \"idiots\" running the Hosttower and their inability to discern a true wizardly master from a conniving trickster. Deudermont suspected that Robillard had once been denied admission to the guild.\\n\\n \"Why Luskan?\" the ship\u0027s wizard complained. \"Would not Waterdeep have better suited our needs? No harbor along the entire Sword Coast can compare with Waterdeep\u0027s repair facilities.\"\\n\\n \"Luskan was closer,\" Deudermont reminded him.\\n\\n \"A couple of days, no more,\" Robillard retorted.\\n\\n \"If a storm found us in those couple of days, the damaged hull might have split apart, and all our bodies would have been food for the crabs and the fishes,\" said the captain. \"It seemed a foolish gamble for the sake of one man\u0027s pride.\"\\n\\n Robillard started to respond but caught the meaning of the captain\u0027s last statement before he could embarrass himself further. A great frown shadowed his face. \"The pirates would have had us had I not timed the blast perfectly,\" the wizard muttered after he took a few moments to calm down.\\n\\n Deudermont conceded the point. Indeed, Robillard\u0027s work in the last pirate hunt had been nothing short of spectacular. Several years before, Sea Sprite-the new, bigger, faster, and stronger Sea Sprite-had been commissioned by the lords of Waterdeep as a pirate hunter. No vessel had ever been as successful at the task, so much so that when the lookout spotted a pair of pirateers sailing the northern waters off the Sword Coast, so near to Luskan, where Sea Sprite often prowled, Deudermont could hardly believe it. The schooner\u0027s reputation alone had kept those waters clear for many months.\\n\\n These pirates had come looking for vengeance, not easy merchant ship prey, and they were well prepared for the fight, each of them armed with a small catapult, a fair contingent of archers, and a pair of wizards. Even so, they found themselves outmaneuvered by the skilled Deudermont and his experienced crew, and out-magicked by the mighty Robillard, who had been wielding his powerful dweomers in vessel-to-vessel warfare for well over a decade. One of Robillard\u0027s illusions had given the appearance that Sea Sprite was dead in the water, her mainmast down across her deck, with dozens of dead men at the rails. Like hungry wolves, the pirates had circled, closer and closer, then had come in, one to port and one to starboard, to finish off the wounded ship.\\n\\n In truth, Sea Sprite hadn\u0027t been badly damaged at all, with Robillard countering the offensive magic of the enemy wizards. The small pirate catapults had little effect against the proud schooner\u0027s armored sides.\\n\\n Deudermont\u0027s archers, brilliant bowmen all, had struck hard at the closing vessels, and the schooner went from battle sail to full sail with precision and efficiency, the prow of the ship verily leaping from the water as she scooted out between the surprised pirateers.\\n\\n Robillard dropped a veil of silence upon the pirate ships, preventing their wizards from casting any defensive spells, then plopped three fireballs-Boom! Boom! Boom!-in rapid succession, one atop each ship and one in between. Then came the conventional barrage from ballista and catapult, Sea Sprite\u0027s gunners soaring lengths of chain to further destroy sails and rigging and balls of pitch to heighten the flames.\\n\\n De-masted and drifting, fully ablaze, the two pirateers soon went down. So great was the conflagration that Deudermont and his crew managed to pluck only a few survivors from the cold ocean waters.\\n\\n Sea Sprite hadn\u0027t escaped unscathed, though. She was under the power of but one full sail now. Even more dangerous, she had a fair-sized crack just above the waterline. Deudermont had to keep nearly a third of his crew at work bailing, which was why he had steered for the nearest port-Luskan.\\n\\n Deudermont considered it a fine choice, indeed. He preferred Luskan to the much larger port of Waterdeep, for while his financing had come from the southern city and he could find dinner at the house of any lord in town, Luskan was more hospitable to his common crew members, men without the standing, the manners, or the pretensions to dine at the table of nobility. Luskan, like Waterdeep, had its defined classes, but the bottom rungs on Luskan\u0027s social ladder were still a few above the bottom of Waterdeep\u0027s.\\n\\n Calls of greeting came to them from every wharf as they neared the city, for Sea Sprite was well known here and well respected. The honest fishermen and merchant sailors of Luskan, of all the northern reaches of the Sword Coast, had long ago come to appreciate the work of Captain Deudermont and his swift schooner.\\n\\n \"A fine choice, I\u0027d say,\" the captain remarked.\\n\\n \"Better food, better women, and better entertainment in Waterdeep,\" Robillard replied. \"But no finer wizards,\" Deudermont couldn\u0027t resist saying. \"Surely the Hosttower is among the most respected of mage guilds in all the Realms.\"\\n\\n Robillard groaned and muttered a few curses, pointedly walking away.\\n\\n Deudermont didn\u0027t turn to watch him go, but he couldn\u0027t miss the distinctive stomping of the wizard\u0027s hard-soled boots.\\n\\n \"Just a short ride, then,\" the woman cooed, twirling her dirty blonde hair in one hand and striking a pouting posture. \"A quick one to take me jitters off before a night at the tables.\"\\n\\n The huge barbarian ran his tongue across his teeth, for his mouth felt as if it were full of fabric, and dirty cloth at that. After a night\u0027s work in the tavern of the Cutlass, he had returned to the wharves with Morik for a night of harder drinking. As usual, the pair had stayed there until after dawn, then Wulfgar had crawled back to the Cutlass, his home and place of employment, and straight to his bed.\\n\\n But this woman, Delly Curtie, a barmaid in the tavern and Wulfgar\u0027s lover for the past few months, had come looking for him. Once, he had viewed her as a pleasurable distraction, the icing on his whisky cake, and even as a caring friend. Delly had nurtured Wulfgar through his first difficult days in Luskan. She had seen to his needs, emotional and physical, without question, without judgment, without asking anything in return. But of late the relationship had begun to shift, and not even subtly. Now that he had settled more comfortably into his new life, a life devoted almost entirely to fending the remembered pain of his years with Errtu, Wulfgar had come to see a different picture of Delly Curtie.\\n\\n Emotionally, she was a child, a needful little girl. Wulfgar, who was well into his twenties, was several years older than she. Now, suddenly, he had become the adult in their relationship, and Delly\u0027s needs had begun to overshadow his own.\\n\\n \"Oh, but ye\u0027ve got ten minutes for me, me Wulfgar,\" she said, moving closer and rubbing her hand across his cheek.\\n\\n Wulfgar grabbed her wrist and gently but firmly moved her hand away. \"A long night,\" he replied. \"And I had hoped for more rest before beginning my duties for Arumn.\"\\n\\n \"But I\u0027ve got a tingling-\"\\n\\n \"More rest,\" Wulfgar repeated, emphasizing each word.\\n\\n Delly pulled away from him, her seductive pouting pose becoming suddenly cold and indifferent. \"Good enough for ye, then,\" she said coarsely. \"Ye think ye\u0027re the only man wanting to share me bed?\"\\n\\n Wulfgar didn\u0027t justify the rant with an answer. The only answer he could have given was to tell her he really didn\u0027t care, that all of this-his drinking, his fighting-was a manner of hiding and nothing more. In truth, Wulfgar did like and respect Delly and considered her a friend-or would have if he honestly believed that he could be a friend. He didn\u0027t mean to hurt her.\\n\\n Delly stood in Wulfgar\u0027s room, trembling and unsure. Suddenly, feeling very naked in her slight shift, she gathered her arms in front of her and ran out into the hall and to her own room, slamming the door hard.\\n\\n Wulfgar closed his eyes and shook his head. He chuckled helplessly and sadly when he heard Delly\u0027s door open again, followed by running footsteps heading down the hall toward the outside door. That one, too, slammed, and Wulfgar understood that all the ruckus had been for his benefit Delly wanted him to hear that she was, indeed, going out to find comfort in another\u0027s arms.\\n\\n She was a complicated one, the barbarian understood, carrying more emotional turmoil than even he, if that were possible. He wondered how it had ever gone this far between them. Their relationship had been so simple at the start, so straightforward: two people in need of each other. Recently, though, it had become more complex, the needs having grown into emotional crutches. Delly needed Wulfgar to take care of her, to shelter her, to tell her she was beautiful, but Wulfgar knew he couldn\u0027t even take care of himself, let alone another. Delly needed Wulfgar to love her, and yet the barbarian had no love to give. For Wulfgar there was only pain and hatred, only memories of the demon Errtu and the prison of the Abyss, wherein he had been tortured for six long years.\\n\\n Wulfgar sighed and rubbed the sleep from his eyes, then reached for a bottle, only to find it empty. With a frustrated snarl, he threw it across the room, where it shattered against a wall. He envisioned, for just a moment, that it had smashed against Delly Curtie\u0027s face. The image startled Wulfgar, but it didn\u0027t surprise him. He vaguely wondered if Delly hadn\u0027t brought him to this point on purpose; perhaps this woman was no innocent child, but a conniving huntress. When she had first come to him, offering comfort, had she intended to take advantage of his emotional weakness to pull him into a trap? To get him to marry her, perhaps? To rescue him that he might one day rescue her from the miserable existence she had carved out for herself as a tavern wench?\\n\\n Wulfgar realized that his knuckles had gone white from clenching his hands so very hard, and he pointedly opened them and took several deep, steadying breaths. Another sigh, another rub of his tongue over dirty teeth, and the man stood and stretched his huge, nearly seven-foot, frame. He discovered, as he did nearly every afternoon when he went through this ritual, that he had even more aches in his huge muscles and bones this day. Wulfgar glanced over at his large arms, and though they were still thicker and more muscular than that of nearly any man alive, he couldn\u0027t help but notice a slackness in those muscles, as if his skin was starting to hang a bit too loosely on his massive frame.\\n\\n How different his life was now than it had been those mornings years ago in Icewind Dale, when he had worked the long day with Bruenor, his adoptive dwarven father, hammering and lifting huge stones, or when he had gone out hunting for game or giants with Drizzt, his warrior friend, running all the day, fighting all the day. The hours had been even more strenuous then, more filled with physical burden, but that burden had been just physical and not emotional. In that time and in that place, he felt no aches.\\n\\n The blackness in his heart, the sorest ache, was the source of it all.\\n\\n He tried to think back to those lost years, working and fighting beside Bruenor and Drizzt, or when he had spent the day running along the wind-blown slopes of Kelvin\u0027s Cairn, the lone mountain in Icewind Dale, chasing Catti-brie. . . .\\n\\n The mere thought of the woman stopped him cold and left him empty and in that void, images of Errtu and the demon\u0027s minions inevitably filtered in. Once, one of those minions, the horrid succubus, had assumed the form of Catti-brie, a perfect image, and Errtu had convinced Wulfgar that he had managed to snare the woman, that she had been taken to suffer the same eternal torment as Wulfgar, because of Wulfgar.\\n\\n Errtu had taken the succubus, Catti-brie, right before Wulfgar\u0027s horrified eyes and had torn the woman apart limb from limb, devouring her in an orgy of blood and gore.\\n\\n Gasping for his breath, Wulfgar fought back to his thoughts of Catti-brie, of the real Catti-brie. He had loved her. She was, perhaps, the only woman he had ever loved, but she was lost to him now forever, he believed. Though he might travel to Ten-Towns in Icewind Dale and find her again, the bond between them had been severed, cut by the sharp scars of Errtu and by Wulfgar\u0027s own reactions to those scars.\\n\\n The long shadows coming in through the window told him that the day neared its end and that his work as Arumn Gardpeck\u0027s bouncer would soon begin. The weary man hadn\u0027t lied to Delly when he had declared that he needed more rest, though, and so he collapsed back onto his bed and fell into a deep sleep.\\n\\n Night had settled thickly about Luskan by the time Wulfgar staggered into the crowded common room of the Cutlass.\\n\\n \"Late again, as if we\u0027re to be surprised by that,\" a thin, beady-eyed man named Josi Puddles, a regular at the tavern and a good friend of Arumn Gardpeck, remarked to the barkeep when they both noticed Wulfgar\u0027s entrance. \"That one\u0027s workin\u0027 less and drinkin\u0027 ye dry.\"\\n\\n Arumn Gardpeck, a kind but stern and always practical man, wanted to give his typical response, that Josi should just shut his mouth, but he couldn\u0027t refute Josi\u0027s claim. It pained Arumn to watch Wulfgar\u0027s descent. He had befriended the barbarian those months before, when Wulfgar had first come to Luskan. Initially, Arumn had shown interest in the man only because of Wulfgar\u0027s obvious physical prowess-a mighty warrior like Wulfgar could indeed be a boon to business for a tavern in the tough dock section of the feisty city. After his very first conversation with the man, Arumn had understood that his feelings for Wulfgar went deeper than any business opportunity. He truly liked the man.\\n\\n Always, Josi was there to remind Arumn of the potential pitfalls, to remind Arumn that, sooner or later, mighty bouncers made meals for rats in gutters.\\n\\n \"Ye thinkin\u0027 the sun just dropped in the water?\" Josi asked Wulfgar as the big man shuffled by, yawning.\\n\\n Wulfgar stopped, and turned slowly and deliberately to glare at the little man.\\n\\n \"Half the night\u0027s gone,\" Josi said, his tone changing abruptly from accusational to conversational, \"but I was watchin\u0027 the place for ye. Thought I might have to break up a couple o\u0027 fights, too.\"\\n\\n Wulfgar eyed the little man skeptically. \"You couldn\u0027t break up a pane of thin glass with a heavy cudgel,\" he remarked, ending with another profound yawn.\\n\\n Josi, ever the coward, took the insult with a bobbing head and a self-deprecating grin.\\n\\n \"We do have an agreement about yer time o\u0027 work,\" Arumn said seriously.\\n\\n \"And an understanding of your true needs,\" Wulfgar reminded the man. \"By your own words, my real responsibility comes later in the night, for trouble rarely begins early. You named sundown as my time of duty but explained that I\u0027d not truly be needed until much later.\"\\n\\n \"Fair enough,\" Arumn replied with a nod that brought a groan from Josi. He was anxious to see the big man-the big man whom he believed had replaced him as Arumn\u0027s closest friend-severely disciplined.\\n\\n \"The situation\u0027s changed,\" Arumn went on. \"Ye\u0027ve made a reputation and more than a few enemies. Every night, ye wander in late, and yer . . . our enemies take note. I fear that one night soon ye\u0027ll stagger in here past the crest o\u0027 night to find us all murdered.\"\\n\\n Wulfgar put an incredulous expression on his face and turned away with a dismissive wave of his hand.\\n\\n \"Wulfgar,\" Arumn called after him forcefully.\\n\\n The barbarian turned about, scowling.\\n\\n \"Three bottles missing last night,\" Arumn said calmly, quietly, a note of concern evident in his tone.\\n\\n \"You promised me all the drink I desired,\" Wulfgar answered.\\n\\n \"For yerself,\" Arumn insisted. \"Not for yer sculking little friend.\"\\n\\n All about widened their eyes at that remark, for not many of Luskan\u0027s tavernkeepers would speak so boldly concerning the dangerous Morik the Rogue.\\n\\n Wulfgar lowered his gaze and chuckled, shaking his head. \"Good Arumn,\" he began, \"would you prefer to be the one to tell Morik he is not welcome to your drink?\"\\n\\n Arumn narrowed his eyes, and Wulfgar returned the glare for just a moment.\\n\\n Delly Curtie entered the room just then, her eyes red and still lined with tears. Wulfgar looked at her and felt a pang of guilt, but it was not something he would admit publicly. He turned and went about his duties, moving to threaten a drunk who was getting a bit too loud.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s playing her like he\u0027d pick a lute,\" Josi Puddles remarked to Arumn.\\n\\n Arumn blew a frustrated sigh. He had become quite fond of Wulfgar, but the big man\u0027s increasingly offensive behavior was beginning to wear that fondness thin. Delly had been as a daughter to Arumn for a couple of years. If Wulfgar was playing her without regard for her emotions, he and Arumn were surely heading for a confrontation.\\n\\n Arumn turned his attention from Delly to Wulfgar just in time to see the big man lift the loudmouth by the throat, carry him to the door, and none too gently heave him out into the street.\\n\\n \"Man didn\u0027t do nothing,\" Josi Puddles complained. \"He keeps with that act, and you\u0027ll not have single customer.\"\\n\\n Arumn merely sighed.\\n\\n A trio of men in the opposite corner of the bar also studied the huge barbarian\u0027s movements with more than a passing interest. \"Cannot be,\" one of them, a skinny, bearded fellow, muttered. \"The world\u0027s a wider place than that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m telling ye it is,\" the middle one replied. \"Ye wasn\u0027t aboard Sea Sprite back in them days. I\u0027d not forget that one, not Wulfgar. Sailed with him all the way from Waterdeep to Memnon, I did, then back again, and we fought our share o\u0027 pirates along the way.\"\\n\\n \"Looks like a good one to have along for a pirate fight,\" remarked Waillan Micanty, the third of the group.\\n\\n \"So \u0027tis true!\" said the second. \"Not as good as his companion, though. Ye\u0027re knowin\u0027 that one. A dark-skinned fellow, small and pretty lookin\u0027, but fiercer than a wounded sahuagin, and quicker with a blade-or a pair o\u0027 the things-than any I ever seen.\"\\n\\n \"Drizzt Do\u0027Urden?\" asked the skinny one. \"That big one traveled with the drow elf?\"\\n\\n \"Yep,\" said the second, now commanding their fullest attention. He was smiling widely, both at being the center of it all and in remembering the exciting voyage he had taken with Wulfgar, Drizzt, and the drow\u0027s panther companion.\\n\\n \"What about Catti-brie?\" asked Waillan, who, like all of Deudermont\u0027s crew, had developed a huge crush on the beautiful and capable woman soon after she and Drizzt had joined their crew a couple of years before. Drizzt, Catti-brie, and Guenhywvar had sailed aboard Sea Sprite for many months, and how much easier scuttling pirates had been with that trio along!\\n\\n \"Catti-brie joined us south o\u0027 Baldur\u0027s Gate,\" the storyteller explained. \"She came in with a dwarf, King Bruenor of Mithral Hall, on a flying chariot that was all aflame. Never seen anything like it, I tell ye, for that wild dwarf put the thing right across the sails o\u0027 one o\u0027 the pirate ships we was fighting. Took the whole danged ship down, he did, and was still full o\u0027 spit and battle spirit when we pulled him from the water!\"\\n\\n \"Bah, but ye\u0027re lyin\u0027,\" the skinny sailor started to protest.\\n\\n \"No, I heard the story,\" Waillan Micanty put in. \"Heard it from the captain himself, and from Drizzt and Catti-brie.\"\\n\\n That quieted the skinny man. All of them just sat and studied Wulfgar\u0027s movements a bit longer.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re sure that\u0027s him?\" the first asked. \"That\u0027s the Wulfgar fellow?\"\\n\\n Even as he asked the question, Wulfgar brought Aegis-fang off of his back and placed it against a wall.\\n\\n \"Oh, by me own eyes, that\u0027s him,\" the second answered. \"I\u0027d not be forgettin\u0027 him or that hammer o\u0027 his. He can split a mast with the thing, I tell ye, and put it in a pirate\u0027s eye, left or right, at a hunnerd long strides.\"\\n\\n Across the room, Wulfgar had a short argument with a patron. With one mighty hand the barbarian reached out and grabbed the man\u0027s throat and easily, so very easily, hoisted him from his seat and into the air. Wulfgar strode calmly across the inn to the door and tossed the drunk into the street.\\n\\n \"Strongest man I ever seen,\" the second sailor remarked, and his two companions weren\u0027t about to disagree. They drained their drinks and watched a bit longer before leaving the Cutlass for home, where they found themselves running anxiously to inform their captain of who they\u0027d seen.\\n\\n Captain Deudermont rubbed his fingers pensively across his neatly trimmed beard, trying to digest the tale Waillan Micanty had just related to him. He was trying very hard, for it made no sense to him. When Drizzt and Catti-brie had sailed with him during those wonderful early years of chasing pirates along the Sword Coast, they had told him a sad tale of Wulfgar\u0027s demise. The story had had a profound effect on Deudermont, who had befriended the huge barbarian on that journey to Memnon years before.\\n\\n Wulfgar was dead, so Drizzt and Catti-brie had claimed, and so Deudermont had believed. Yet here was one of Duedermont\u0027s trusted crewmen claiming that the barbarian was very much alive and well and working in the Cutlass, a tavern Deudermont had frequented.\\n\\n The image brought Deudermont back to his first meeting with the barbarian and Drizzt in the Mermaid\u0027s Arms tavern in Waterdeep. Wulfgar had avoided a fight with a notorious brawler by the name of Bungo. What great things the barbarian and his companions had subsequently accomplished, from rescuing their little halfling friend from the clutches of a notorious pasha in Calimport to the reclamation of Mithral Hall for Clan Battlehammer. The thought, of Wulfgar working as a brawler in a seedy tavern in Luskan seemed preposterous.\\n\\n Especially since, according to Drizzt and Catti-brie, Wulfgar was dead.\\n\\n Deudermont thought of his last voyage with the duo when Sea Sprite had put onto a remote island far out at sea. A blind seer had accosted Drizzt with a riddle about one he thought he had lost. The last time Deudermont had seen Drizzt and Catti-brie was at their parting, on an inland lake, no less, where Sea Sprite had been inadvertently transported.\\n\\n So might Wulfgar be alive? Captain Deudermont had seen too much to dismiss the possibility out of hand.\\n\\n Still, it seemed likely to the captain that his crewmen had been mistaken. They had little experience with northern barbarians, all of whom seemed huge and blond and strong. One might look like another to them. The Cutlass had taken on a barbarian warrior as a bouncer, but it was not Wulfgar.\\n\\n He thought no more of it, having many duties and engagements to attend at the more upscale homes and establishments in the city. Three days later, however, when dining at the table of one of Luskan\u0027s noble families, the conversation turned to the death of one of the city\u0027s most reknowned bullies.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re a lot better off without Tree Block Breaker,\" one of the guests insisted. \"The purest form of trouble ever to enter our city.\"\\n\\n \"Just a thug and nothing more,\" another replied, \"and not so tough.\"\\n\\n \"Bah, but he could take down a running horse by stepping in front of the thing,\" the first insisted. \"I saw him do so!\"\\n\\n \"But he couldn\u0027t take down Arumn Gardpeck\u0027s new boy,\" the other put in. \"When he tried to fight that fellow, our Tree Block Breaker flew out of the Cutlass and brought the frame of a door with him.\"\\n\\n Deudermont\u0027s ears perked up.\\n\\n \"Yeah, that one,\" the first agreed. \"Too strong for any man, from the stories I am hearing, and that warhammer! Most beautiful weapon I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\\n\\n The mention of the hammer nearly made Deudermont choke on his food, for he remembered well the power of Aegis-fang. \"What is his name?\" the captain inquired.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s name?\"\\n\\n \"Arumn Gardpeck\u0027s new boy.\"\\n\\n The two men looked at each other and shrugged. \"Wolf-something, I believe,\" the first said.\\n\\n When he left the noble\u0027s house, a couple of hours later, Captain Deudermont found himself wandering not back to Sea Sprite, but along infamous Half-Moon Street, the toughest section of Luskan, the home of the Cutlass. He went in without hesitation, pulling up a chair at the first empty table. Duedermont spotted the big man before he even sat down. It was, without doubt, Wulfgar, son of Beornegar. The captain hadn\u0027t known Wulfgar very well and hadn\u0027t seen him in years, but there could be no question about it. The sheer size, the aura of strength, and the piercing blue eyes of the man gave him away. Oh, he was more haggard-looking now, with an unkempt beard and dirty clothes, but he was Wulfgar.\\n\\n The big man met Duedermont\u0027s stare momentarily, but there was no recognition in the barbarian\u0027s eyes when he turned away. Deudermont became even more certain when he saw the magnificent warhammer, Aegis-fang, strapped across Wulfgar\u0027s broad back.\\n\\n \"Ye drinking or looking for a fight?\"\\n\\n Deudermont turned about to see a young woman standing beside his table, tray in hand.\\n\\n \"Well?\"\\n\\n \"Looking for a fight?\" the captain repeated dully, not understanding.\\n\\n \"The way ye\u0027re staring at him,\" the young woman responded, motioning toward Wulfgar. \"Many\u0027s the ones who come in here looking for a fight. Many\u0027s the ones who get carried away from here. But good enough for ye if ye\u0027re wanting to fight him, and good enough for him if ye leave him dead in the street.\"\\n\\n \"I seek no fight,\" Deudermont assured her. \"But, do tell me, what is his name?\"\\n\\n The woman snorted and shook her head, frustrated for some reason Deudermont could not fathom. \"Wulfgar,\" she answered. \"And better for us all if he never came in here.\" Without asking again if he wanted a drink, she merely walked away.\\n\\n Deudermont paid her no further heed, staring again at the big man. How had Wulfgar wound up here? Why wasn\u0027t he dead? And where were Drizzt, and Catti-brie?\\n\\n He sat patiently, watching the lay of the place as the hours passed, until dawn neared and all the patrons, save he and one skinny fellow at the bar, had drifted out.\\n\\n \"Time for leaving,\" the barkeep called to him. When Duerdermont made no move to respond or rise from his chair, the man\u0027s bouncer made his way over to the table.\\n\\n Looming huge, Wulfgar glared down upon the seated captain. \"You can walk out, or you can fly out,\" he explained gruffly. \"The choice is yours to make.\"\\n\\n \"You have traveled far from your fight with pirates south of Baldur\u0027s Gate,\" the captain replied. \"Though I question your direction.\"\\n\\n Wulfgar cocked his head and studied the man more closely. A flicker of recognition, just a flicker, crossed his bearded face.\\n\\n \"Have you forgotten our voyage south?\" Deudermont prompted him. \"The fight with pirate Pinochet and the flaming chariot?\"\\n\\n Wulfgar\u0027s eyes widened. \"What do you know of these things?\"\\n\\n \"Know of them?\" Deudermont echoed incredulously. \"Why, Wulfgar, you sailed on my vessel to Memnon and back. Your friends, Drizzt and Catti-brie, sailed with me again not too long ago, though surely they thought you dead!\"\\n\\n The big man fell back as if he had been slapped across the face. A jumbled mixture of emotions flashed across his clear blue eyes, everything from nostalgia to loathing. He spent a long moment trying to recover from the shock.\\n\\n \"You are mistaken, good man,\" he replied at last to Deudermont\u0027s surprise. \"About my name and about my past. It is time for you to leave.\"\\n\\n \"But Wulfgar,\" Deudermont started to protest. He jumped in surprise to find another man, small and dark and ominous, standing right behind him, though he had heard not a footfall of approach. Wulfgar looked to the little man, then motioned to Arumn. The barkeep, after a moment\u0027s hesitation, reached behind the bar and produced a bottle, tossing it across the way where sure-fingered Morik caught it easily.\\n\\n \"Walk or fly?\" Wulfgar asked Deudermont again. The sheer emptiness of his tone, not icy cold, but purely indifferent, struck Deudermont profoundly, told him that the man would make good on the promise to launch him out of the tavern without hesitation if he didn\u0027t move immediately.\\n\\n \"Sea Sprite is in port for another week at the least,\" Deudermont explained, rising and heading for the door. \"You are welcomed there as a guest or to join the crew, for I have not forgotten,\" he finished firmly, the promise ringing in his wake as he slipped from the inn.\\n\\n \"Who was that?\" Morik asked Wulfgar after Deudermont had disappeared into the dark Luskan night.\\n\\n \"A fool,\" was all that the big man would answer. He went to the bar and pointedly pulled another bottle from the shelf. Turning his gaze from Arumn to Delly, the surly barbarian left with Morik.\\n\\n Captain Duedermont had a long walk ahead of him to the dock. The sights and sounds of Luskan\u0027s nightlife washed over him-loud, slurred voices through open tavern windows, barking dogs, clandestine whispers in dark corners-but Duedermont scarcely heard them, engrossed as he was in his own thoughts.\\n\\n So Wulfgar was alive, and yet in worse condition than the captain could ever have imagined the heroic man. His offer to the barbarian to join the crew of Sea Sprite had been genuine, but he knew from the barbarian\u0027s demeanor that Wulfgar would never take him up on it.\\n\\n What was Deudermont to do?\\n\\n He wanted to help Wulfgar, but Deudermont was experienced enough in the ways of trouble to understand that you couldn\u0027t help a man who didn\u0027t want help.\\n\\n \"If you plan to leave a dinner engagement, kindly inform us of your whereabouts,\" came a reproachful greeting as the captain approached his ship. He looked up to see both Robillard and Waillan Micanty staring down at him from the rail.\\n\\n \"You shouldn\u0027t be out alone,\" Waillan Micanty scolded, but Deudermont merely waved away the notion.\\n\\n Robillard frowned his concern. \"How many enemies have we made these last years?\" the wizard demanded in all seriousness. \"How many would pay sacks of gold for a mere chance at your head?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why I employ a wizard to watch over me,\" Deudermont replied calmly, setting foot up the plank.\\n\\n Robillard snorted at the absurdity of the remark. \"How am I to watch over you if I don\u0027t even know where you are?\"\\n\\n Duedermont stopped in his tracks, and a wide smile creased his face as he gazed up at his wizard. \"If you can\u0027t locate me magically, what faith should I hold that you could find those who wish me harm?\"\\n\\n \"But it is true, Captain,\" Waillan interjected while Robillard flushed darkly. \"Many would love to meet up with you unguarded in the streets.\"\\n\\n \"Am I to bottle up the whole crew, then?\" Deudermont asked. \"None shall leave, for fear of reprisals by friends of the pirates?\"\\n\\n \"Few would leave Sea Sprite alone,\" Waillan argued.\\n\\n \"Fewer still would be known enough to pirates to be targets!\" Robillard spouted. \"Our enemies would not attack a minor and easily replaced crewman, for to do so would incur the wrath of Deudermont and the lords of Waterdeep, but the price might be worth paying for the chance to eliminate the captain of Sea Sprite.\" The wizard blew a deep sigh and eyed the captain pointedly. \"You should not be out alone,\" he finished firmly.\\n\\n \"I had to check on an old friend,\" Deudermont explained.\\n\\n \"Wulfgar, by name?\" asked the perceptive wizard.\\n\\n \"So I thought,\" replied Deudermont sourly as he continued up the plank and by the two men, going to his quarters without another word.\\n\\n It was too small and nasty a place to even have a name, a gathering hole for the worst of Luskan\u0027s wretches. They were sailors mostly, wanted by lords or angry families for heinous crimes. Their fears that walking openly down a street in whatever port their ship entered would get them arrested or murdered were justified. So they came to holes like this, back rooms in shanties conveniently stocked near to the docks.\\n\\n Morik the Rogue knew these places well, for he\u0027d got his start on the streets working as lookout for one of the most dangerous of these establishments when he was but a young boy. He didn\u0027t go into such holes often anymore. Among the more civilized establishments, he was highly respected and regarded, and feared, and that was probably the emotion Morik most enjoyed. In here, though, he was just another thug, a little thief in a nest of assassins.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t resist entering a hole this night, though, not with the captain of the famed Sea Sprite showing up to have a conversation with his new friend, Wulfgar.\\n\\n \"How tall?\" asked Creeps Sharky, one of the two thugs at Morik\u0027s table. Creeps was a grizzled old sea dog with uneven clumps of dirty beard on his ruddy cheeks and one eye missing. \"Cheap Creeps,\" the patrons often called him, for the man was quick with his rusty old dagger and slow with his purse. So tight was Creeps with his booty that he wouldn\u0027t even buy a proper patch for his missing eye. The dark edge of the empty socket stared out at Morik from beneath the lowest folds of the bandana Creeps had tied about his head.\\n\\n \"Head and a half taller than me,\" Morik answered. \"Maybe two.\"\\n\\n Creeps glanced to his pirate companion, an exotic specimen, indeed. The man had a thick topknot of black hair and tattoos all about his face, neck, and practically every other patch of exposed flesh-and since all he wore was a kilt of tiger skin, there was more than a little flesh exposed. Just following Creeps\u0027s glance to the other sent a shudder along Morik\u0027s spine, for while he didn\u0027t know the specifics of Creeps\u0027s companion, he had certainly heard the rumors about the \"man,\" Tee-a-nicknick. This pirate was only half human, the other half being qullan, some rare and ferocious warrior race.\\n\\n \"Sea Sprite\u0027s in port,\" Creeps remarked to Morik. The rogue nodded, for he had seen the three-masted schooner on his way to this drinking hole.\\n\\n \"He wore a beard just about the jawline,\" Morik added, trying to give as complete a description as he could.\\n\\n \"He sit straight?\" the tattooed pirate asked.\\n\\n Morik looked at Tee-a-nicknick as if he did not understand.\\n\\n \"Did he sit straight in his chair?\" Creeps clarified, assuming a pose of perfect posture. \"Lookin\u0027 like he had a plank shoved up his arse all the way to his throat?\"\\n\\n Morik smiled and nodded. \"Straight and tall.\"\\n\\n Again the two pirates shared a glance.\\n\\n \"Soundin\u0027 like Deudermont,\" Creeps put in. \"The dog. I\u0027d give a purse o\u0027 gold to put me knife across that one\u0027s throat. Put many o\u0027 me friends to the bottom, he has, and cost all o\u0027 us prettily.\"\\n\\n The tattooed pirate showed his agreement by hoisting a bulging purse of coins onto the table. Morik realized then that every other conversation in the hole had come to an abrupt halt and that all eyes were upon him and his two rakish companions.\\n\\n \"Aye, Morik, but ye\u0027re likin\u0027 the sight,\" Creeps remarked, indicating the purse. \"Well, it\u0027s yer own to have, and ten more like it, I\u0027m guessin\u0027.\" Creeps jumped up suddenly, sending his chair skidding back across the floor. \"What\u0027re ye sayin\u0027, lads?\" he cried. \"Who\u0027s got a gold coin or ten for the head o\u0027 Deudermont o\u0027 Sea Sprite?\"\\n\\n A great cheer went up throughout the rathole, with many curses spoken against Deudermont and his pirate-killing crew.\\n\\n Morik hardly heard them, so focused was he on the purse of gold. Deudermont had come to see Wulfgar. Every man in the place, and a hundred more like them, no doubt, would pitch in a few more coins. Deudermont knew Wulfgar well and trusted him. A thousand gold pieces. Ten thousand? Morik and Wulfgar could get to Deudermont, and easily. Morik\u0027s greedy, thieving mind reeled at the possibilities. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-2.html","bookId":2132,"book":{"id":2132,"title":"The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2)","description":"Storyline: The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2) \\n Spending time in the unimaginable torture chambers of the Abyss for even a day would be enough to break even the heartiest soul, and the barbarian Wulfgar was there for years.
