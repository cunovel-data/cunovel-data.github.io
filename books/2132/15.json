{"id":94563,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Wulfgar stood outside of Luskan, staring back at the city where he had been wrongly accused, tortured, and publicly humiliated. Despite all of that, the barbarian held no anger toward the folk of the town, even toward the vicious magistrate. If he happened upon Jharkheld, he would likely twist the man\u0027s head off, but out of a need for closure on that particular incident and not out of hatred. Wulfgar was past hatred, had been for a long time. As it was when Tree Block Breaker had come hunting him at the Cutlass, and he had killed the man. As it was when he happened upon the Sky Ponies, a barbarian tribe akin to his own. He had taken vengeance upon their wicked shaman, an oath of revenge he had sworn years before. It was not for hatred, not even for unbridled rage, but simply Wulfgar\u0027s need to try to push forward in a life where the past was too horrible to contemplate.\n Wulfgar had come to realize that he wasn\u0027t moving forward, and that point seemed obvious to him now as he stared back at the city. He was going in circles, small circles, that left him in the same place over and over, a place made tolerable only through use of the bottle, only by blurring the past into oblivion and putting the future out of mind.\n Wulfgar spat on the ground, trying for the first time since he had come to Luskan months before to figure out how he had entered this downward spiral. He thought of the open range to the north, his homeland of Icewind Dale, where he had shared such excitement and joy with his friends. He thought of Bruenor, who had beaten him in battle when he was but a boy, but had shown him such mercy. The dwarf had taken him in as his own, then brought Drizzt to train him in the true ways of the warrior. What a friend Drizzt had been, leading him on grand adventures, standing by him in any fight, no matter the odds. He\u0027d lost Drizzt.\n He thought again of Bruenor, who had given Wulfgar his greatest achievement in craftsmanship, the wondrous Aegis-fang. The symbol of Bruenor\u0027s love for him. And now he\u0027d lost not only Bruenor, but Aegis-fang as well.\n He thought of Catti-brie, perhaps the most special of all to him, the woman who had stolen his heart, the woman he admired and respected above all. Perhaps they could not be lovers, or husband and wife. Perhaps she would never bear his children, but she was his friend, honest and true. When he thought of their last encounter he came to understand the truth of that friendship. Catti-brie would have given anything to help him, would have shared with him her most intimate moments and feelings, but Wulfgar understood that her heart was truly for another.\n The fact didn\u0027t bring anger or jealousy to the barbarian. He felt only respect, for despite her feelings, Catti-brie would have given all to help him. Now Catti-brie was lost to him, too.\n Wulfgar spat again. He didn\u0027t deserve them, not Bruenor, Drizzt, nor Catti-brie. Not even Regis, who, despite his diminutive size and lack of fighting prowess, would leap in front of Wulfgar in time of crisis, would shield the barbarian, as much as he could, from harm. How could he have thrown all that away?\n His attention shifted abruptly back to the present as a wagon rolled out of Luskan\u0027s western gate. Despite his foul mood, Wulfgar could not hold back a smile as the wagon approached. The driver, a plump elderly woman, came into view.\n Morik. The two had been banished only days before, but they had hung about the city\u0027s perimeter. The rogue explained that he was going to have to secure some supplies if he was to survive on the open road, so he\u0027d reentered the city alone. Judging from the way the pair of horses labored, judging from the fact that Morik had a wagon and horses at all, Wulfgar knew his sneaky little friend had succeeded.\n The rogue turned the wagon off the wide road and onto a small trail that wove into the forest where Wulfgar waited. He came right up to the bottom of the bluff where Wulfgar sat, then stood up and bowed.\n \"Not so difficult a thing,\" he announced.\n \"The guards didn\u0027t notice you?\" Wulfgar asked.\n Morik snorted, as if the notion were preposterous. \"They were the same guards as when we were escorted out,\" he explained, his tone full of pride.\n Their experience at the hands of Luskan\u0027s authorities had reminded Wulfgar that he and Morik were just big players in a small pond, insignificant when measured against the larger pond that was the backdrop of the huge city-but what a large player Morik was in their small corner! \"I even lost a bag of food at the gate,\" Morik went on. \"One of the guards ran to catch up to me so that he could replace it on the wagon.\"\n Wulfgar moved down the bluff to the side of the wagon and pulled aside the canvas that covered the load. There were bags of food at the back, along with rope and material for shelter, but most prominent to Wulfgar\u0027s sensibilities were the cases of bottles, full bottles of potent liquor.\n \"I thought you would be pleased,\" Morik remarked, moving beside the big man as he stared at the haul. \"Leaving the city doesn\u0027t have to mean leaving our pleasures behind. I was thinking of dragging Delly Curtie along as well.\"\n Wulfgar snapped an angry glare at Morik. The mention of the woman in such a lewd manner profoundly offended him.\n \"Come,\" Morik said, clearing his throat and obviously changing the subject. \"Let us find a quiet place where we may quench our thirst,\" The rogue pulled off his disguise slowly, wincing at the pain that still permeated his joints and his ripped stomach. Those wounds, particularly in his knees, would be slow to heal. He paused again a moment later, holding up the wig to admire his handiwork, then climbed onto the driving bench, taking the reins in hand.\n \"The horses are not so fine,\" Wulfgar noted. The team seemed an old, haggard pair.\n \"I needed the gold to buy the drink,\" Morik explained.\n Wulfgar glanced back at the load, thinking that Morik should have spent the funds on a better team of horses, thinking that his days in the bottle had come to an end. He started up the bluff again, but Morik stopped him with a call.\n \"There are bandits on the road,\" the rogue announced, \"or so I was informed in town. Bandits on the road north of the forest, and all the way to the pass through the Spine of the World.\"\n \"You fear bandits?\" Wulfgar asked, surprised.\n \"Only ones who\u0027ve never heard of me,\" Morik explained, and Wulfgar understood the deeper implications. In Luskan, Morik\u0027s reputation served him well by keeping most thugs at bay.\n \"Better that we are prepared for trouble,\" the rogue finished. Morik reached under the driver\u0027s bench and produced a huge axe. \"Look,\" he said with a grin, obviously quite proud of himself as he pointed to the axe head. \"It\u0027s still stained with Creeps Sharky\u0027s blood.\"\n The headsman\u0027s own axe! Wulfgar started to ask Morik how in the Nine Hells he\u0027d managed to get his hands on that weapon but decided he simply didn\u0027t want to know.\n \"Come along,\" Morik instructed, patting the bench beside him. The rogue pulled a bottle from the closest case. \"Let\u0027s ride and drink and plot our defense.\"\n Wulfgar stared long and hard at that bottle before climbing onto the bench. Morik offered him the bottle, but he declined with gritted teeth. Shrugging, the rogue took a healthy swallow and offered it again. Again Wulfgar declined. That brought a puzzled look to Morik\u0027s face, but it fast turned into a smile as he decided that Wulfgar\u0027s refusal would leave more for him.\n \"We needn\u0027t live like savages just because we\u0027re on the road,\" Morik stated.\n The irony of that statement from a man guzzling so potent a drink was not lost on Wulfgar. The barbarian managed to resist the bottle throughout the afternoon, and Morik happily drained it. Keeping the wagon at a swift pace, Morik tossed the empty bottle against a rock as they passed, then howled with delight when it shattered into a thousand pieces.\n \"You make a lot of noise for one trying to avoid highwaymen,\" Wulfgar grumbled.\n \"Avoid?\" Morik asked with a snap of his fingers. \"Hardly that. Highwaymen often have well-equipped campsites where we might find some comfort.\"\n \"Such well-equipped campsites must belong to successful highwaymen,\" Wulfgar reasoned, \"and successful highwaymen are likely very good at what they do.\"\n \"As was Tree Block Breaker, my friend,\" Morik reminded. When Wulfgar still didn\u0027t seem convinced, he added, \"Perhaps they will accept our offer to join with them.\"\n \"I think not,\" said Wulfgar.\n Morik shrugged, then nodded. \"Then we must chase them off,\" he said matter-of-factly.\n \"We\u0027ll not even find them,\" Wulfgar muttered.\n \"Oh?\" Morik asked, and he turned the wagon down a side trail so suddenly that it went up on two wheels and Wulfgar nearly tumbled off.\n \"What?\" the barbarian growled as they bounced along. He just barely ducked a low branch, then got a nasty scratch as another whipped against his arm. \"Morik!\"\n \"Quiet, my large friend,\" the rogue said. \"There\u0027s a river up ahead with but one bridge across it, a bridge bandits would no doubt guard well.\" They burst out of the brush, bouncing to the banks of the river. Morik slowed the tired horses to a walk, and they started across a rickety bridge. To the rogue\u0027s dismay they crossed safely with no bandits in sight.\n \"Novices,\" a disappointed Morik grumbled, vowing to go a few miles, then turn back and cross the bridge again. Morik abruptly stopped the wagon. A large and ugly man stepped onto the road up ahead, pointing a sword their way.\n \"How interesting that such a pair as yourselves should be walking in my woods without my permission,\" the thug remarked, bringing the sword back and dropping it across his shoulder.\n \"Your woods?\" Morik asked. \"Why, good sir, I had thought this forest open for travel.\" Under his breath to Wulfgar, he added, \"Half-orc.\"\n \"Idiot,\" Wulfgar replied so that only Morik could hear. \"You, I mean, and not the thief. To look for this trouble. . . .\"\n \"I thought it would appeal to your heroic side,\" the rogue replied. \"Besides, this highwayman has a camp filled with comforts, no doubt.\"\n \"What\u0027re you talking about?\" the thug demanded.\n \"Why, you, good sir,\" Morik promptly replied. \"My friend here was just saying that he thought you might be a thief and that you do not own this forest at all.\"\n The bandit\u0027s eyes widened, and he stuttered over several responses unsuccessfully. He wound up spitting on the ground. \"I\u0027m saying it\u0027s my wood!\" he declared, poking his chest. \"Togo\u0027s wood!\"\n \"And the cost of passage through, good Togo?\" Morik asked.\n \"Five gold!\" the thug cried and after a pause, he added, \"Each of you!\"\n \"Give it to him,\" Wulfgar muttered.\n Morik chuckled, then an arrow zipped past, barely an inch in front of his face. Surprised that this band was so well organized, the rogue abruptly changed his mind and started reaching for his purse.\n However, Wulfgar had changed his mind as well, enraged that someone had nearly killed him. Before Morik could agree on the price, the barbarian leaped from the wagon and rushed at Togo barehanded, then suddenly changed his mind and direction. A pair of arrows cut across his initial path. He turned for the monstrous archer he\u0027d spotted perched high in a tree a dozen feet back from the road. Wulfgar crashed through the first line of brush and slammed hard into a fallen log. Hardly slowing, he lifted the log and threw it into the face of another crouching human, then continued his charge.\n He made it to the base of the tree just as an arrow thunked into the ground beside him, a near miss Wulfgar ignored. Leaping to a low branch, he caught hold and hauled himself upward with tremendous strength and agility, nearly running up it. Bashing back small branches, scrambling over others, he came level with the archer. The creature, a gnoll bigger than Wulfgar, was desperately trying to set another arrow.\n \"Keep it!\" the cowardly gnoll yelled, throwing the bow at Wulfgar and stepping off the branch, preferring the twenty-foot drop to Wulfgar\u0027s rage.\n Escape wasn\u0027t that easy for the gnoll. Wulfgar thrust out a hand and caught the falling creature by the collar. Despite all the wriggling and punching, the awkward position and the gnoll\u0027s weight, Wulfgar had no trouble hauling it up.\n Then he heard Morik\u0027s cry for help.\n Standing on the driver\u0027s bench, the rogue worked furiously with his slender sword to fend off the attacks from both Togo and another human swordsman who had come out from the brush. Worse, he heard a third approaching from behind, and worse still, arrows regularly cut the air nearby.\n \"I\u0027ll pay!\" he cried, but the monstrous thugs only laughed.\n Out of the corner of his eye Morik spotted an archer taking aim. He leaped backward as the missile came on, dodging both it and the thrust from the surprisingly deft swordsman in front of him. The move cost him, though, for he tumbled over the back of the bench, crashing into a case of bottles, shattering them. Morik leaped up and shrieked his outrage, smashing his sword impotently across the chair back.\n On came Togo, gaining the bench position, but angry Morik matched his movements, coming ahead powerfully without regard for the other swordsman or archers. Togo retracted his arm for a swing, but Morik, quick with the blade, stabbed first, scoring a hit on Togo\u0027s hand that cost the thug his grip. Even as Togo\u0027s sword clanged against the wooden bench Morik closed in, turning his sword out to fend off the attacks from Togo\u0027s partner. He produced a dagger from his belt, a blade he promptly and repeatedly drove into Togo\u0027s belly. The half-orc tried desperately to fond off the attacks, using his bare hands, but Morik was too quick and too clever, stabbing around them even as his sword worked circles about Togo\u0027s partner\u0027s blade.\n Togo fell back from the bench to the ground. He managed only a single running step before he collapsed, clutching his torn guts.\n Morik heard the third attacker coming in around the side of the wagon. He heard a terrified scream from above, then another from the approaching enemy. The rogue glanced that way just in time to see Wulfgar\u0027s captured gnoll archer flying down from on high, arms flailing, screaming all the way. The humanoid missile hit the third thug, a small human woman, squarely, smashing both hard against the wagon in a heap. Groaning, the woman began trying to crawl away; the archer lay very still.\n Morik pressed the attack on the remaining swordsman, as much to get down from the open driver\u0027s bench as to continue the fight. The swordsman, though, apparently had little heart remaining in the battle with his friends falling all around him. He parried Morik\u0027s thrust, backing all the while as the man leaped down to the road.\n On Morik came, his sword working the thug\u0027s blade over and under. He thrust ahead and retracted quickly when the swordsman blocked, then came forward after a subtle roll of his slender sword that disengaged the thug\u0027s blade. Staggering, the man retreated, blood running from one shoulder. He started to turn and flee, but Morik kept pace, forcing him to work defensively.\n Morik heard another cry of alarm behind him, followed by the crack of breaking branches. He smiled with the knowledge that Wulfgar continued to clear out the archers.\n \"Please, mister,\" Morik\u0027s prey grunted as more and more of the rogue\u0027s attacks slipped through with stinging results and it became clear that Morik was the superior swordsman. \"We was just needing your money.\"\n \"Then you wouldn\u0027t have harmed me and my friend after you took our coin?\" Morik asked cynically.\n The man shook his head vigorously, and Morik used the distraction to slip through yet again, drawing a line of red on the man\u0027s cheek. Morik\u0027s prey fell to his knees with a yelp and tossed his sword to the ground, begging for mercy.\n \"I am known as a merciful sort,\" Morik said with mock sympathy, hearing Wulfgar approaching fast, \"but my friend, I fear, is not.\"\n Wulfgar stormed by and grabbed the kneeling man by the throat, hoisting him into the air and running him back into a tree. With one arm-the other tucked defensively with a broken arrow shaft protruding from his shoulder-Wulfgar held the highwayman by the throat off the ground, choking the life out of him.\n \"I could stop him,\" Morik explained, walking over and putting his hand on his huge friend\u0027s bulging forearm. Only then did he notice Wulfgar\u0027s serious wound. \"You must lead us to your camp.\"\n \"No camp!\" the man gasped. Wulfgar pressed and twisted.\n \"I will! I will!\" the thug squealed, his voice going away as Wulfgar tightened his grip, choking all sounds and all air. His face locked in an expression of the purest rage, the barbarian pressed on.\n \"Let him go,\" Morik said.\n No answer. The man in Wulfgar\u0027s grasp wriggled and slapped but could neither break the hold nor draw breath.\n \"Wulfgar!\" Morik called, and he grabbed at the big man\u0027s arm with both hands, tugging fiercely. \"Snap out of it, man!\"\n Wulfgar wasn\u0027t hearing any of it, didn\u0027t even seem to notice the rogue.\n \"You will thank me for this,\" Morik vowed, though he was not so sure as he balled up his fist and smashed Wulfgar on the side of the head.\n Wulfgar did let go of the thug, who slumped unconscious at the base of the tree, but only to backhand Morik, a blow that sent the rogue staggering backward, with Wulfgar coming in pursuit. Morik lifted his sword, ready to plunge it through the big man\u0027s heart if necessary, but at the last moment Wulfgar stopped, blinking repeatedly, as if he had just come awake. Morik recognized that Wulfgar had returned from wherever he had gone to this time and place.\n \"He\u0027ll take us to the camp now,\" the rogue said.\n Wulfgar nodded dumbly, his gaze still foggy. He looked dispassionately at the broken arrow shaft poking from his wounded shoulder. The barbarian blanched, looked to Morik in puzzlement, then collapsed face down in the dirt.\n Wulfgar awoke in the back of the wagon on the edge of a field lined by towering pines. He lifted his head with some effort and nearly panicked. A woman walking past was one of the thugs from the road. What happened? Had they lost? Before full panic set in, though, he heard Morik\u0027s lighthearted voice, and he forced himself up higher, wincing with pain as he put some weight on his injured arm. Wulfgar looked at that shoulder curiously; the arrow shaft was gone, the wound cleaned and dressed.\n Morik sat a short distance away, chatting amiably and sharing a bottle with another of the gnollish highwaymen as if they were old friends. Wulfgar slid to the end of the wagon and rolled his legs over, climbing unsteadily to his feet. The world swam before his eyes, black spots crossing his field of vision. The feeling passed quickly, though, and Wulfgar gingerly but deliberately made his way over to Morik.\n \"Ah, you\u0027re awake. A drink, my friend?\" the rogue asked, holding out the bottle.\n Frowning, Wulfgar shook his head.\n \"Come now, ye gots to be drinkin\u0027,\" the dog-faced gnoll sitting next to Morik slurred. He spooned a glob of thick stew into his mouth, half of it falling to the ground or down the front of his tunic.\n Wulfgar glared at Morik\u0027s wretched new comrade.\n \"Rest easy, my friend,\" Morik said, recognizing that dangerous look. \"Mickers here is a friend, a loyal one now that Togo is dead.\"\n \"Send him away,\" Wulfgar said, and the gnoll dropped his jaw in surprise.\n Morik came up fast, moving to Wulfgar\u0027s side and taking him by the good arm. \"They are allies,\" he explained. \"All of them. They were loyal to Togo, and now they are loyal to me. And to you.\"\n \"Send them away,\" Wulfgar repeated fiercely.\n \"We\u0027re out on the road,\" Morik argued. \"We need eyes, scouts to survey potential territory and swords to help us hold it fast.\"\n \"No,\" Wulfgar said flatly.\n \"You don\u0027t understand the dangers, my friend,\" Morik said reasonably, hoping to pacify his large friend.\n \"Send them away!\" Wulfgar yelled suddenly. Seeing he\u0027d make no progress with Morik, he stormed up to Mickers. \"Be gone from here and from this forest!\"\n Mickers looked past the big man. Morik gave a resigned shrug.\n Mickers stood up. \"I\u0027ll stay with him,\" he said, pointing to the rogue.\n Wulfgar slapped the stew bowl from the gnoll\u0027s hand and grabbed the front of his shirt, pulling him up to his tiptoes. \"One last chance to leave of your own accord,\" the big man growled as he shoved Mickers back several steps.\n \"Mister Morik?\" Mickers complained.\n \"Oh, be gone,\" Morik said unhappily.\n \"And the rest of us, too?\" asked another one of the humans of the bandit band, standing amidst a tumble of rocks on the edge of the field. He held a strung bow.\n \"Them or me, Morik,\" Wulfgar said, his tone leaving no room for debate. The barbarian and the rogue both glanced back to the archer to see that the man had put an arrow to his bowstring.\n Wulfgar\u0027s eyes flared with simmering rage, and he started toward the archer. \"One shot,\" he called steadily. \"You will get one shot at me. Will you hit the mark?\"\n The archer lifted his bow.\n \"I don\u0027t think you will,\" Wulfgar said, smiling. \"No, you will miss because you know.\"\n \"Know what?\" the archer dared ask.\n \"Know that even if your arrow strikes me, it will not kill me,\" Wulfgar replied, and he continued his deliberate stalk. \"Not right away, not before I get my hands around your throat.\"\n The man drew his bowstring back, but Wulfgar only smiled more confidently and continued forward. The archer glanced around nervously, looking for support, but there was none to be found. Realizing he had taken on too great a foe, the man eased his string, turned, and ran off.\n Wulfgar turned back. Mickers, too, had sprinted away.\n \"Now we\u0027ll have to watch out for them,\" Morik observed glumly when Wulfgar returned to him. \"You cost us allies.\"\n \"I\u0027ll not ally myself with murdering thieves!\" Wulfgar said simply.\n Morik jumped back from him. \"What am I, if not a thief?\"\n Wulfgar\u0027s expression softened. \"Well, perhaps just one,\" he corrected with a chuckle.\n Morik laughed uneasily. \"Here, my big and not so smart friend,\" he said, reaching for another bottle. \"A drink to the two of us. Highwaymen!\"\n \"Will we find the same fate as our predecessors?\" Wulfgar wondered aloud.\n \"Our predecessors were not so smart,\" Morik explained. \"I knew where to find them because they were too predictable. A good highwayman strikes and runs on to the next target area. A good highwayman seems like ten separate bands, always one step ahead of the city guards, ahead of those who ride into the cities with information enough to find and defeat him.\"\n \"You sound as if you know the life well.\"\n \"I have done it from time to time,\" Morik admitted. \"Just because we\u0027re on the wild road doesn\u0027t mean we must live like savages,\" the rogue repeated what was fast becoming his mantra. He held the bottle out toward Wulfgar.\n It took all the willpower he could muster for Wulfgar to refuse that drink. His shoulder ached, and he was still agitated about the thugs. Retreat into a swirl of semiconsciousness was very inviting at that moment.\n But he did refuse by walking away from a stunned Morik. Moving to the other end of the field, he scrambled up a tree, settled into a comfortable niche, and sat back to survey the outlying lands.\n His gaze was drawn repeatedly to the mountains in the north, the Spine of the World, the barrier between him and that other world of Icewind Dale, that life he might have known and might still know. He thought of his friends again, mostly of Catti-brie. The barbarian fell asleep to dreams of her close in his arms, kissing him gently, a respite from the pains of the world.\n Suddenly Catti-brie backed away, and as Wulfgar watched, small ivory horns sprouted from her forehead and great bat wings extended behind her. A succubus, a demon of the Abyss, tricking him again in the hell of Errtu\u0027s torments, assuming the guise of comfort to seduce him.\n Wulfgar\u0027s eyes popped open wide, his breath coming in labored gasps. He tried to dismiss the horrible images, but they wouldn\u0027t let him go. Not this time. So poignant and distinct were they that the barbarian wondered if all of this, his last months of life, had been but a ruse by Errtu to bring him hope again so that the demon might stomp it. He saw the succubus, the horrid creature that had seduced him . . .\n \"No!\" Wulfgar growled, for it was too ugly a memory, too horrible for him to confront it yet again.\n I stole your seed, the succubus said to his mind, and he could not deny it. They had done it to him several times in the years of his torment, had taken his seed and spawned alu-demons, Wulfgar\u0027s children. It was the first time Wulfgar had been able to consciously recall the memory since his return to the surface, the first time the horror of seeing his demonic offspring had forced itself through the mental barriers he had erected.\n He saw them now, saw Errtu bring to him one such child, a crying infant, its mother succubus standing behind the demon. He saw Errtu present the infant high in the air, and then, right before Wulfgar\u0027s eyes, right before its howling mother\u0027s eyes, the great demon bit the child\u0027s head off. A spray of blood showered Wulfgar, who was unable to draw breath, unable to comprehend that Errtu had found a way to get at him yet again, the worst way of all.\n Wulfgar half scrambled and half tumbled out of the tree, landing hard on his injured shoulder, reopening the wound. Ignoring the pain, he sprinted across the field and found Morik resting beside the wagon. Wulfgar went right to the crates and frantically tore one open.\n His children! The offspring of his stolen seed!\n The potent liquid burned all the way down, the heat of it spreading, spreading, dulling Wulfgar\u0027s senses, blurring the horrid images. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-15.html","bookId":2132,"book":{"id":2132,"title":"The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2) \n Spending time in the unimaginable torture chambers of the Abyss for even a day would be enough to break even the heartiest soul, and the barbarian Wulfgar was there for years.
