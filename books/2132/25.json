{"id":94573,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"\"This is our chance,\" Wulfgar explained to Morik. The pair were crouched behind a shielding wall of stone on a mountainside above one of the many small villages on the southern side of the Spine of the World.\n Morik looked at his friend and shook his head, giving a less-than-enthusiastic sigh. Not only had Wulfgar refrained from the bottle in the three weeks since their return from Auckney, but had forbidden either of them to engage in any more highwayman activities. The season was getting late, turning toward winter, which meant a nearly constant stream of caravans as the last merchants returned from Icewind Dale. The seasonal occupants of the northern stretches left then as well, the men and women who went to Ten-Towns to fish for the summers then rolled their wagons back to Luskan when the season ended.\n Wulfgar had made it clear to Morik that their thieving days were over. So here they were, overlooking a small, incredibly boring village they\u0027d learned was expecting some sort of orc or goblin attack.\n \"They will not attack from below,\" Wulfgar remarked, pointing to a wide field east of the village on the same height as the higher buildings. \"From there,\" Wulfgar explained.\n \"That\u0027s where they\u0027ve constructed their wall and best defenses,\" Morik replied, as if that should settle it all. They believed that the coming band of monsters numbered less than a score, and while there weren\u0027t more than half that number in the town, Morik didn\u0027t see any real problems here.\n \"More may come down from above,\" Wulfgar reasoned. \"The villagers might be sorely pressed if attacked from two sides.\"\n \"You\u0027re looking for an excuse,\" Morik accused. Wulfgar stared at him curiously. \"An excuse to get into the fight,\" the rogue clarified, which brought a smile to Wulfgar\u0027s face. \"Unless it\u0027s against merchants,\" Morik glumly added.\n Wulfgar held his calm and contented expression. \"I wish to battle deserving opponents,\" he said.\n \"I know many peasants who would argue that merchants are more deserving than goblinkind,\" Morik replied.\n Wulfgar shook his head, in no mood and with no time to sit and ponder the philosophical points. They saw the movement beyond the village, the approach of monsters Wulfgar knew, of creatures the barbarian could cut down without remorse or regard. A score of orcs charged wildly across the field, rushing past the ineffective arrow volleys from the villagers.\n \"Go and be done with it,\" Morik said, starting to rise.\n Wulfgar, a student of such attacks, held him down and turned his gaze up the slopes to where a huge boulder soared down, smashing the side of one building.\n \"There\u0027s a giant above,\" Wulfgar whispered, already starting his circle up the mountain. \"Perhaps more.\"\n \"So that is where we shall go,\" Morik grumbled with resignation, though he obviously doubted the wisdom of such a course.\n Another rock soared down, then a third.The giant was lifting a fourth when Wulfgar and Morik turned a bend in the trail and slipped between a pair of boulders, spotting the behemoth from behind.\n Wulfgar\u0027s hand axe bit into the giant\u0027s arm, and it dropped the boulder onto its own head. The giant bellowed and spun about to where Morik stood shrugging, slender sword in hand. Bellowing, the giant came at him in one long stride. Morik yelped and turned to flee back through the boulders. The giant came on in swift pursuit, but as it reached the narrow pass Wulfgar leaped atop one of the boulders and brought his ordinary hammer in hard against the side of the behemoth\u0027s head, sending it staggering. By the time the dazed giant managed to look to the boulder Wulfgar was already gone. Back on the ground, the barbarian rushed at the giant\u0027s side to smash its kneecap hard, then dashed back into the boulders.\n The giant ran in pursuit, clutching its bruised head, then its aching knee, then looking at the axe deep into its forearm. It changed direction suddenly, having had enough of this fight, and ran up the mountainside instead, back into the wilds of the Spine of the World.\n Morik stepped from the boulders and offered his hand to Wulfgar. \"A job well done,\" he congratulated him.\n Wulfgar ignored the hand. \"A job just begun,\" he corrected, sprinting down the mountainside toward the village and the battle being waged at the eastern barricade.\n \"You do love the fighting,\" Morik commented dryly after his friend. Sighing, he loped behind.\n Below, the battle at the barricade was practically at a standoff, with no orcs yet breaching the shielding wall, but few had taken any solid hits, either. That changed abruptly when Wulfgar came down from on high, running full out across the field, howling at the top of his lungs. Leaping, soaring, arms outstretched, he crashed into four of the creatures, bearing them all to the ground. A frenzy of clubbing and stabbing, punching and kicking ensued. More orcs moved to join the fight but in the end, bloody, battered, but smiling widely, Wulfgar was the only one to emerge alive.\n Rallied by his amazing assault and by the appearance of Morik, who had struck down another orc on his way down the slope, the villagers poured into the remaining raiding party. The routed creatures, the dozen who still could run, fled back the way they had come.\n By the time Morik got near Wulfgar, the barbarian was surrounded by villagers, patting him, cheering him, promising eternal friendship, offering him a place to live for the coming winter.\n \"You see,\" Wulfgar said to Morik with a happy smile. \"Easier than any work at the pass.\"\n Wiping off his blade, the rogue eyed his friend skeptically. The fight had been easy, even more so than an optimistic Wulfgar had predicted. Morik, too, was quickly surrounded by appreciative villagers, including a couple of young and attractive women. A quiet winter of relaxation in front of a blazing hearth might not be so bad a thing. Perhaps he would hold off on his plans to return to Luskan after all.\n Meralda\u0027s first three months of married life had been wonderful. Not blissful, but wonderful, as she watched her mother grow strong and healthy for the first time in years. Even life at the castle was not as bad as she had feared. Priscilla was there, of course, never more than casually friendly and often glowering, but she\u0027d made no move against Meralda. How could she with her brother so obviously enamored of his wife?\n She, too, had grown to love her husband. That combined with the sight of her healthy mother had made it a lovely autumn for the young woman, a time of things new, a time of comfort, a time of hope.\n But as winter deepened about Auckney, ghosts of the past began to creep into the castle.\n Jaka\u0027s child growing large and kicking reminded Meralda in no uncertain terms of her terrible lie. She found herself thinking more and more about Jaka Sculi, of her own moments of foolishness regarding him, and there had been many. She pondered the last moments of Jaka\u0027s life when he had cried out her name, had risked his entire existence for her. At the time, Meralda had convinced herself that it was out of jealousy for Lord Feringal and not love. Now, with Jaka\u0027s child kicking in her womb and the inevitable haze brought by the passage of time, she wasn\u0027t so sure. Perhaps Jaka had loved her in the end. Perhaps the tingling they\u0027d felt on their night of passion had also planted the seeds of deeper emotions that had only needed time to find their way through the harsh reality of a peasant\u0027s existence.\n More likely her mood was just the result of winter\u0027s gloom playing on her thoughts, and on her new husband\u0027s as well. It didn\u0027t help that their lovemaking decreased dramatically as Meralda\u0027s belly increased in size. He came to her one morning when the snow was deep about the castle and the wind howled through the cracks in the stone. Even as he began kissing her, he stopped and stared hard at her, then he\u0027d asked her an unthinkable question.\n What had it been like with the barbarian?\n If he had kicked her in the head, it would not have hurt so much, yet Meralda was not angry at her husband, could surely understand his doubts and fears given her distant mood and the tangible evidence that she had been with another man.\n The woman told herself repeatedly that once the child was born and taken away, she and Feringal would settle into a normal existence. In that time when the obvious pressures were gone, they would come to love each other deeply. She could only hope that it all would not disintegrate in the months she had left carrying the child.\n Of course, as the tension grew between Feringal and Meralda, so too did the scowls Priscilla shot Meralda\u0027s way. Power wrought of having Lord Feringal wrapped around her little finger had given Meralda the upper hand in the constant silent war Priscilla waged against her. Growing thick with another man\u0027s child, she found that power waning.\n She didn\u0027t understand it, though, considering Priscilla\u0027s initial response to learning that she had been raped. Priscilla had even mentioned taking the child as her own, to raise away from the castle, as was often done in such situations.\n \"You are uncommonly large for so early in the pregnancy,\" Priscilla remarked to her on the same winter day that Feringal had asked her about Wulfgar. It occurred to Meralda that the shrewish woman had obviously sensed the palpable tension between the couple. Priscilla\u0027s voice was uncommonly thick with suspicion and venom, which told Meralda that her sister-in-law was keeping close track of the passage of time. There would be trouble, indeed, when Meralda delivered a healthy, full-term baby only seven months after the incident on the road. Yes, Priscilla would have questions.\n Meralda deflected the conversation by sharing her fears about the barbarian\u0027s size, that perhaps the child would tear her apart. That had silenced Priscilla briefly, but Meralda knew the truce wouldn\u0027t last and the questions would return.\n Indeed, as winter waned and Meralda\u0027s belly swelled, the whispers began throughout Auckney. Whispers about the child\u0027s due date. Whispers about the incident on the road. Whispers about the tragic death of Jaka Sculi. No fool, Meralda saw people counting on their fingers, saw the tension in her mother\u0027s face, though the woman wouldn\u0027t openly ask for the truth.\n When the inevitable happened, predictably, Priscilla proved the source of it.\n \"You will birth the child in the month of Ches,\" the woman said rather sharply as she and Meralda dined with Steward Temigast one cold afternoon. The equinox was fast approaching, but winter hadn\u0027t released its grip on the land yet, a howling blizzard whipping the snow deep around the castle walls. Meralda looked at her skeptically.\n \"Mid-Ches,\" Priscilla remarked. \"Or perhaps late in the month, or even early in the Month of the Storms.\"\n \"Do you sense a problem with the pregnancy?\" Steward Temigast intervened.\n Once again Meralda recognized that the man was her ally. He too knew, or at least he suspected as much as Priscilla, yet he\u0027d shown no hostility toward Meralda. She\u0027d begun to regard Temigast as a father figure, but the comparison seemed even more appropriate when she thought back to the morning after her night with Jaka, when Dohni Ganderlay had suspected the truth but had forgiven it in light of the larger sacrifice, the larger good.\n \"I sense a problem, all right,\" Priscilla replied brittly, somehow managing to convey through her tone that she meant no problem with the physical aspects of the pregnancy. Priscilla looked at Meralda and huffed, then threw down her napkin and rushed away, heading right up the stairs.\n \"What\u0027s she about?\" Meralda asked Temigast, her eyes fearful. Before he could respond, she had her answer, when shouts rang out from upstairs. Neither of them could make out any distinct words, but it was obvious Priscilla had gone to speak with her brother.\n \"What should I do-\" Meralda started to say, but Temigast hushed her.\n \"Eat, my lady,\" he said calmly. \"You must remain strong, for you\u0027ve trials ahead.\" Meralda understood the double meaning in those words. \"I\u0027m certain you\u0027ll come through them as long as you keep your wits about you,\" the old steward added with a comforting wink. \"When it is all past, you will find the life you desire.\"\n Meralda wanted to run over and bury her head on the man\u0027s shoulder, or to run out of the castle altogether, down the road to the warm and comfortable house Lord Feringal had given to her family and bury her face on her father\u0027s shoulder. Instead, she took a deep breath to steady herself, then did as Temigast suggested and ate her meal.\n The snow came early and deep that year. Morik would have preferred Luskan, but he\u0027d come to see Wulfgar\u0027s point in bringing them to this village refuge. There was plenty of work to do, particularly after snowfalls when the grounds had to be cleared and defensible berms built, but Morik managed to avoid most of it by feigning an injury from the battle that had brought them here.\n Wulfgar, though, went at the work with relish, using it to keep his body so occupied he hadn\u0027t time to think or dream. Still, Errtu found him in that village as he had in every place Wulfgar went, every place he would ever go. Now, instead of hiding in a bottle from the demon, the barbarian met those memories head-on, replayed the events, however horrible, and forced himself to admit that it had happened, all of it, and that he had faced moments of weakness and failure. Many times Wulfgar sat alone in the dark corner of the room he had been given, trembling, wet with cold sweat, and with tears he could hold back no longer. Many times he wanted to run to Morik\u0027s inexhaustible supply of potent liquor, but he did not.\n He growled and he cried out, and yet he held fast his resolve to accept the past for what it was and to somehow move beyond it. Wulfgar didn\u0027t know where he had found the strength and determination, but he suspected it had laid dormant within him, summoned when he\u0027d witnessed the courage Meralda had displayed to free him. She\u0027d had so much more to lose than he, and yet she had rejuvenated his faith in the world. He knew now that his fight with Errtu would continue until he had honestly won, that he could hide in a bottle, but not forever.\n They fought another battle around the turn of the year, a minor skirmish with another band of orcs. The villagers had seen the attack coming and had prepared the battlefield, pouring melted snow over the field of approach. When the orcs arrived they came skidding in on sheets of ice that left them floundering in the open while archers picked them off.\n The unexpected appearance of a group of Luskan soldiers who had lost their way on patrol did more to distress Wulfgar and Morik and shatter their idyllic existence than that battle. Wulfgar was certain at least one of the soldiers recognized the pair from Prisoner\u0027s Carnival, but either the soldiers said nothing to the villagers or the villagers simply didn\u0027t care. The pair heard no tremors of unrest after the soldiers departed.\n In the end, it was the quietest winter Wulfgar and Morik had ever known, a needed respite. The season turned to spring, though the snow remained thick, and the pair began to lay their future plans.\n \"No more highwaymen,\" Wulfgar reminded Morik one quiet night halfway through the month of Ches.\n \"No,\" the rogue agreed. \"I don\u0027t miss the life.\"\n \"What, then, for Morik?\"\n \"Back to Luskan, I\u0027m afraid,\" the rogue said. \"My home. Ever my home.\"\n \"And your disguise will keep you safe?\" Wulfgar asked with genuine concern.\n Morik smiled. \"The folk have short memories, my friend,\" he explained, silently adding that he hoped that drow had short memories, as well, for returning to Luskan meant abandoning his mission to watch over Wulfgar. \"Since we were . . . exported they have no doubt sated their bloodthirst on a hundred unfortunates at Prisoner\u0027s Carnival. My disguise will protect me from the authorities, and my true identity will again grant me the respect needed on the streets.\"\n Wulfgar nodded, not doubting Morik in the least. Out here in the wilds the rogue was not nearly as impressive as on the streets of Luskan, where few could match his wiles.\n \"And what for Wulfgar?\" Morik asked, surprised by the honest concern on his own voice. \"Icewind Dale?\" Morik asked. \"Friends of old?\"\n The barbarian shook his head, for he simply didn\u0027t know the road ahead of him. He would have dismissed that possibility with hardly a thought, but he considered it now. Was he ready to return to the side of the companions of the hall, as he, Drizzt, Bruenor, Catti-brie, Guenhwyvar and Regis had once been called? Had he escaped the demon and the demon bottle? Had he come to terms with Errtu and the truth of his imprisonment?\n \"No,\" he answered, and left it at that, wondering if he would ever again meet the gazes of his former friends.\n Morik nodded, though a bit dismayed for his own reasons. He didn\u0027t want Wulfgar to return to Luskan with him. Disguising the huge man would be difficult enough, but it was more than that. Morik didn\u0027t want Wulfgar to be caught by the dark elves.\n \"She is playing you for a fool, and all of Auckney knows it, Feri!\" Priscilla screamed at her brother \"Don\u0027t call me that!\" he snapped, pushing past her, looking for distraction from the subject. \"You know I hate it.\"\n Priscilla would not let it go. \"Can you deny the stage of her pregnancy?\" she pressed. \"She will give birth within two weeks.\"\n \"The barbarian was a large man,\" Feringal growled. \"The child will be large, and that is what is deceiving you.\"\n \"The child will be average,\" Priscilla retorted, \"as you shall learn within the month.\" Her brother started to walk away. \"I\u0027ll wager he\u0027ll be a pretty thing with the curly brown hair of his father.\" That brought Feringal spinning about, glaring at her. \"His dead father,\" the woman finished, not backing down an inch.\n Lord Feringal crossed the few feet separating them in one stride and slapped his sister hard across the face. Horrified by his own actions, he fell back, holding his face in his hands.\n \"My poor cuckolded brother,\" Priscilla replied to that slap, glaring at him above the hand she had brought to her bruise. \"You will learn.\" With that, she stalked from the room.\n Lord Feringal stood there, motionless for a long, long time, trying hard to steady his breathing.\n Three days after their discussion, the weather had warmed enough to bring about a thaw, allowing Morik and Wulfgar to depart the village. The villagers were unhappy to see them go, especially because the thaw signaled the time of renewed monster attacks. The pair, particularly impatient Morik, would hear none of their pleas.\n \"Perhaps I will return to you,\" Wulfgar remarked, and he was thinking that he might indeed, once he and Morik had gone their own ways outside of Luskan. Where else might the barbarian go, after all?\n The road out of the foothills was slow and so muddy and treacherous that the pair often had to walk, leading their horses carefully. Once the mountains gave way to the flatter plain just north of Luskan they found the going relatively easy.\n \"You still have the wagon and the supplies we left at the cave,\" Morik remarked.\n Wulfgar realized the rogue was beginning to feel a pang of guilt about leaving him. \"The cave did not remain empty throughout the winter I\u0027m sure,\" the barbarian remarked. \"Not so many supplies left, I would guess.\"\n \"Then take the belongings of the present occupants,\" Morik replied with a wink. \"Giants, perhaps, nothing for Wulfgar to fear.\" That brought a smile to both their faces, but they didn\u0027t hold.\n \"You should have stayed in the village,\" Morik reasoned. \"You can\u0027t go back to Luskan with me, so the village seems as good a place as any while you decide your course.\"\n They\u0027d come to a fork in the road. One path headed south to Luskan, the other to the west. When Morik turned to regard Wulfgar, he found the man staring out that second course, back toward the small fiefdom where he had been imprisoned, where Morik (to hear Morik tell it) had rescued him from a torturous death.\n \"Plotting revenge?\" the rogue asked.\n Wulfgar looked at him curiously, then caught on. \"Hardly,\" he replied. \"I am wondering the fate of the lady of the castle.\"\n \"The one who wrongly accused you of raping her?\" Morik asked.\n Wulfgar shrugged, as if not wanting to concede that point. \"She was with child,\" he explained, \"and very much afraid.\"\n \"You believe she cuckolded her husband?\" Morik asked.\n Wulfgar wrinkled his lips and nodded.\n \"So she offered your head to protect her reputation,\" Morik said derisively. \"Typical noble lady.\"\n Wulfgar didn\u0027t reply, but he wasn\u0027t seeing things quite that way. The barbarian understood that she had never intended for him to be caught, but rather, that he should remain a distant and mysterious solution to her personal problems. It was understandable, if not honorable.\n \"She must have had the babe by now,\" he mumbled to himself. \"I wonder how she faired when they saw it and realized the child couldn\u0027t be mine.\"\n Morik recognized Wulfgar\u0027s tone, and it worried him. \"I\u0027ll not have to wonder your fate if you go back to determine hers,\" Morik dryly remarked. \"You couldn\u0027t get into that town without being recognized.\"\n Wulfgar nodded, not disagreeing, but he was smiling all the while, a look that was not lost on Morik. \"But you could,\" he said.\n Morik spent a long while studying his friend. \"If my road was not Luskan,\" he replied.\n \"A road of your own making, and with no appointments needing prompt attention,\" said Wulfgar.\n \"Winter is not yet gone. We took a chance in coming down from the foothills. Another storm might descend at any time, burying us deep.\" Morik continued to protest, but Wulfgar could tell by the rogue\u0027s tone that he was considering it.\n \"The storms are not so bad south of the mountains.\"\n Morik scoffed.\n \"This last favor?\" Wulfgar asked.\n \"Why do you care?\" Morik argued. \"The woman nearly had you killed, and in a manner horrible enough to have satisfied the crowd at Prisoner\u0027s Carnival.\"\n Wulfgar shrugged, not honestly sure of that answer himself, but he wasn\u0027t about to back down. \"A last act of friendship between us two,\" he prodded, \"that we might properly part in the hopes of seeing each other again.\"\n Morik scoffed again. \"One last fight with me at your side is all you\u0027re after,\" he said half humorously. \"Admit it, you\u0027re nothing as a fighter without me!\" Even Wulfgar had to laugh at Morik\u0027s irony, but he followed it up with a plaintive expression.\n \"Oh, lead on,\" Morik grumbled, conceding as Wulfgar knew he would. \"I will play the part of Lord Brandeburg yet again. I only hope that Brandeburg was not connected with your escape and that our common departure times were seen by Feringal as pure coincidence.\"\n \"If captured, I will honestly tell Lord Feringal that you played no part in my escape,\" Wulfgar said, a crooked smile showing under his thick winter beard.\n \"You have no idea how the promise comforts me,\" Morik said wryly as he pushed his friend ahead of him toward the west, toward trouble in Auckney. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-25.html","bookId":2132,"book":{"id":2132,"title":"The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2) \n Spending time in the unimaginable torture chambers of the Abyss for even a day would be enough to break even the heartiest soul, and the barbarian Wulfgar was there for years.
