{"id":94558,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Robillard scratched his chin when he saw the pair, Wulfgar and Morik, moving down the alley toward the front door of the Cutlass. Deudermont was still inside, a fact that did not sit well with the divining wizard, given all the activity he had seen outside the tavern\u0027s door. Robillard had watched a seedy character come out and pay off a street urchin. The wizard understood the uses of such children. That same character, an unusual figure indeed, had exited the Cutlass again and moved off into the shadows.\\n\\n Wulfgar appeared with a small, swarthy man. Robillard was not surprised when the same street urchin peeked out from an alley some distance away, no doubt waiting for his opportunity to return to his chosen place of business.\\n\\n Robillard realized the truth after putting the facts together and adding a heavy dose of justifiable suspicion. He turned to the door and chanted a simple spell, grabbing at the air and using it to blast open the portal. \"Mister Micanty!\" he called, amplifying his voice with yet another spell.\\n\\n \"Go out with a pair of crewmen and alert the town guard,\" Robillard demanded. \"To the Cutlass on Half-Moon Street with all speed.\"\\n\\n With a growl the wizard reversed his first spell and slammed the door shut again, then fell back intently into the images within the crystal ball, focusing on the front door of the Cutlass. He moved inside to find Deudermont leaning calmly against the bar.\\n\\n A few uneventful minutes passed; Robillard shifted his gaze back outside just long enough to note Wulfgar and his small friend lurking in the shadows, as if waiting for something.\\n\\n Even as the wizard\u0027s roving magical eye moved back through the tavern\u0027s door, he found Deudermont approaching the exit.\\n\\n \"Hurry, Micanty,\" Robillard mouthed quietly, but he knew that the town guard, well-drilled as they were, wouldn\u0027t likely arrive in time and that he would have to take some action. The wizard plotted his course quickly: a dimensional door to the other end of the docks, and a second to the alley that ran beside the Cutlass. One final look into the crystal ball showed Deudermont walking out and Wulfgar and the other man moving toward him. Robillard let go his mental connection with the ball and brought up the first dimensional door.\\n\\n Creeps Sharky and Tee-a-nicknick crouched in the shadows on the rooftop. The tattooed man brought the blowgun up to his lips the second Deudermont exited the tavern.\\n\\n \"Not yet,\" Creeps instructed, grabbing the barrel and pulling the weapon low. \"Let him talk to Wulfgar and Morik, and get near to my stone that\u0027ll kill any magical protections he might be wearin\u0027. And let others see \u0027em together, afore and when Deudermont falls dead.\"\\n\\n The wretched pirate licked his lips in anticipation. \"They gets the blame, we gets the booty,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Wulfgar,\" Captain Deudermont greeted him when the barbarian and his sidekick shifted out of the shadows and steadily approached. \"My men said you came to Sea Sprite.\"\\n\\n \"Not from any desire,\" Wulfgar muttered, drawing an elbow from Morik.\\n\\n \"You said you want your warhammer back,\" the little man quietly reminded him.\\n\\n What Morik was really thinking, though, was that this might be the perfect time for him to learn more about Deudermont, about the man\u0027s protections and, more importantly, his weaknesses. The street urchin had found the barbarian and the rogue down by the docks, handing over the small bag and its curious contents and explaining that Captain Deudermont desired their presence in front of the Cutlass on Half-Moon Street. Again, Morik had spoken to Wulfgar about the potential gain here, but he backed off immediately as soon as he recognized that dangerous scowl. If Wulfgar would not go along with the assassination, then Morik meant to find a way to do it on his own. He had nothing against Deudermont, of course, and wasn\u0027t usually a murderer, but the payoff was just too great to ignore. Good enough for Wulfgar, Morik figured, when he was living in luxury, the finest rooms, the finest food, the finest booze, and the finest whores.\\n\\n Wulfgar nodded and strode right up to stand before Deudermont, though he did not bother accepting the man\u0027s offered hand. \"What do you know?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Only that you came to the docks and looked up at Waillan Micanty,\" Deudermont replied. \"I assumed that you wished to speak with me.\"\\n\\n \"All that I want from you is information concerning Aegis-fang,\" he said sourly.\\n\\n \"Your hammer?\" Deudermont asked, and he looked curiously at Wulfgar, as if only then noticing that the barbarian was not wearing the weapon.\\n\\n \"The boy said you had information,\" Morik clarified.\\n\\n \"Boy?\" the confused captain asked.\\n\\n \"The boy who gave me this,\" Morik explained, holding up the bag.\\n\\n Deudermont moved to take it but stopped, seeing Robillard rushing out of the alley to the side.\\n\\n \"Hold!\" the wizard cried.\\n\\n Deudermont felt a sharp sting on the side of his neck. He reached up instinctively with his hand to grab at it, but before his fingers closed around the cat\u0027s claw, a great darkness overcame him, buckling his knees. Wulfgar leaped ahead to grab him.\\n\\n Robillard yelled and reached out magically for Wulfgar, extending a wand and blasting the huge barbarian square in the chest with a glob of sticky goo that knocked him back against the Cutlass and held him there. Morik turned and ran.\\n\\n \"Captain! Captain!\" Robillard cried, and he let fly another glob for Morik, but the agile thief was too quick and managed to dodge aside as he skittered down another alley. He had to reverse direction almost immediately, for entering the other end came a pair of city guard, brandishing flaming torches and gleaming swords. He did keep his wits about him enough to toss the satchel the boy had given him into a cubby at the side of the alley before he turned away.\\n\\n All of Half-Moon Street seemed to erupt in a frenzy then, with guardsmen and crewmen of Sea Sprite exiting from every conceivable angle.\\n\\n Against the wall of the Cutlass, Wulfgar struggled mightily to draw breath. His mind whirled back to the grayness of the Abyss, back to some of the many similar magics demon Errtu had put on him to hold him so, helpless in the face of diabolical minions. That vision lent him rage, and that rage lent him strength. The frantic barbarian got his balance and pulled hard, tearing planking from the side of the building.\\n\\n Robillard, howling with frustration and fear as he knelt over the scarcely breathing Deudermont, hit Wulfgar with another glob, pasting him to the wall again.\\n\\n \"They\u0027ve killed him,\" the wizard yelled to the guardsmen. \"Catch the little rat!\"\\n\\n \"We go,\" Tee-a-nicknick said as soon as Deudermont\u0027s legs buckled.\\n\\n \"Hit him again,\" Creeps begged.\\n\\n The tattooed man shook his head. \"One enough. We go.\"\\n\\n Even as he and Creeps started to move, the guards descended upon Half-Moon Street and all the other avenues around the area. Creeps led his friend to the shadows by a dormer on the building, where they deposited the blowgun and poison. They moved to another dormer across the way and sat down with their backs against the wall. Creeps took out a bottle, and the pair started drinking, pretending to be oblivious, happy drunks.\\n\\n Within a few minutes, a trio of guardsmen came over the lip of the roof and approached them. After a cursory inspection and a cry from below revealing that one of the assassins had been captured and the other was running loose through the streets, the guards turned away in disgust.\\n\\n Morik spun and darted one way, then another, but the noose was closing around him. He found a shadow in the nook of a building and thought he might wait the pursuit out, when he began glowing with magical light.\\n\\n \"Wizards,\" the rogue muttered. \"I hate wizards!\"\\n\\n Off he ran to a building and started to climb, but he was caught by the legs and hauled down, then beaten and kicked until he stopped squirming.\\n\\n \"I did nothing!\" he protested, spitting blood with every word as they hauled him roughly to his feet.\\n\\n \"Shut your mouth!\" one guard demanded, jamming the hilt of his sword into Morik\u0027s gut, doubling the rogue over in pain. He half-walked and was half-dragged back to where Robillard worked feverishly over Deudermont.\\n\\n \"Run for a healer,\" the wizard instructed, and a guard and a pair of crewmen took off.\\n\\n \"What poison?\" the wizard demanded of Morik.\\n\\n Morik shrugged as if he did not understand.\\n\\n \"The bag,\" said Robillard. \"You held a bag.\"\\n\\n \"I have no-\" Morik started to say, but he lost the words as the guard beside him slammed him hard in the belly yet again.\\n\\n \"Retrace his steps,\" Robillard instructed the other guards \"He carried a small satchel. I want it found.\"\\n\\n \"What of him?\" one of the guards asked, motioning to the mound of flesh that was Wulfgar. \"Surely he can\u0027t breath under that.\"\\n\\n \"Cut his face free, then,\" Robillard hissed. \"He should not die as easily as that.\"\\n\\n \"Captain!\" Waillan Micanty cried upon seeing Deudermont.\\n\\n He ran to kneel beside his fallen captain. Robillard put a comforting hand on the man\u0027s shoulder, turning a violent glare on Morik.\\n\\n \"I am innocent,\" the little thief declared, but even as he did a cry came from the alley. A moment later a guardsman ran out with the satchel in hand.\\n\\n Robillard pulled open the bag, first lifting the stone from it and sensing immediately what it might be. He had lived through the Time of Troubles after all, and he knew all about dead magic regions and how stones from such places might dispel any magic near them. If his guess was right, it would explain how Morik and Wulfgar had so easily penetrated the wards he\u0027d placed on the captain.\\n\\n Next Robillard lifted a cat\u0027s claw from the bag. He led Morik\u0027s gaze and the stares of all the others from that curious item to Deudermont\u0027s neck, then produced another, similar claw, the one he had pulled from the captain\u0027s wound.\\n\\n \"Indeed,\" Robillard said dryly, eyebrows raised.\\n\\n \"I hate wizards,\" Morik muttered under his breath.\\n\\n A sputter from Wulfgar turned them all around. The big man was coughing out pieces of the sticky substance. He started roaring in rage almost immediately and began tugging with such ferocity that all the Cutlass shook from the thrashing.\\n\\n Robillard noted then that Arumn Gardpeck and several others had exited the place and stood staring incredulously at the scene before them. The tavernkeeper walked over to consider Wulfgar, then shook his head.\\n\\n \"What have ye done?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"No good, as usual,\" remarked Josi Puddles.\\n\\n Robillard walked over to them. \"You know this man?\" he asked Arumn, jerking his head toward Wulfgar.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s worked for me since he came to Luskan last spring,\" Arumn explained. \"Until-\" the tavernkeeper hesitated and stared at the big man yet again, shaking his head.\\n\\n \"Until?\" Robillard prompted.\\n\\n \"Until he got too angry with all the world,\" Josi Puddles was happy to put in.\\n\\n \"You will be summoned to speak against him before the magistrates,\" Robillard explained. \"Both of you.\"\\n\\n Arumn nodded dutifully, but Josi\u0027s head bobbed eagerly. Perhaps too eagerly, Robillard observed, but he had to privately admit his gratitude to the little wretch.\\n\\n A host of priests came running soon after, their numbers and haste alone a testament to the great reputation of the pirate-hunting Captain Deudermont. In mere minutes, the stricken man was born away on a litter.\\n\\n On a nearby rooftop, Creeps Sharky smiled as he handed the empty bottle to Tee-a-nicknick.\\n\\n Luskan\u0027s gaol consisted of a series of caves beside the harbor, winding and muddy, with hard and jagged stone walls. Perpetually stoked fires kept the place brutally hot and steamy. Thick veils of moisture erupted wherever the hot air collided with the cold, encroaching waters of the Sword Coast. There were a few cells, reserved for political prisoners mostly, threats to the ruling families and merchants who might grow stronger if they were made martyrs. Most of the prisoners, though, didn\u0027t last long enough to be afforded cells, soon to be victims of the macabre and brutally efficient Prisoner\u0027s Carnival.\\n\\n This revolving group\u0027s cell consisted of a pair of shackles set high enough on the wall to keep them on the tips of their toes, dangling agonizingly by their arms. Compounding that torture were the mindless gaolers, huge and ugly thugs, half-ogres mostly, walking slowly and methodically through the complex with glowing pokers in their hands.\\n\\n \"This is all a huge mistake, you understand,\" Morik complained to the most recent gaoler to move in his and Wulfgar\u0027s direction.\\n\\n The huge brute gave a slow chuckle that sounded like stones grating together and casually jabbed the orange end of a poker at Morik\u0027s belly. The nimble thief leaped sidelong, pulling hard with his chained arm but still taking a painful burn on the side. The ogre gaoler just kept on walking, approaching Wulfgar, and chuckling slowly.\\n\\n \"And what\u0027ve yerself?\" the brute said, moving his smelly breath close to the barbarian. \"Yerself as well, eh? Ne\u0027er did nothin\u0027 deservin\u0027 such imprisonin\u0027?\"\\n\\n Wulfgar, his face blank, stared straight ahead. He barely winced when the powerful brute slugged him in the gut or when that awful poker slapped against his armpit, sending wispy smoke from his skin.\\n\\n \"Strong one,\" the brute said and chuckled again. \"More fun\u0027s all.\" He brought the poker up level with Wulfgar\u0027s face and began moving it slowly in toward the big man\u0027s eye.\\n\\n \"Oh, but ye\u0027ll howl,\" he said.\\n\\n \"But we have not yet been tried!\" Morik complained.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re thinkin\u0027 that matters?\" the gaoler replied, pausing long enough only to turn a toothy grin on Morik. \"Ye\u0027re all guilty for the fun of it, if not the truth.\"\\n\\n That struck Wulfgar as a profound statement. Such was justice. He looked at the gaoler as if acknowledging the ugly creature for the first time, seeing simple wisdom there, a viewpoint come from observation. From the mouths of idiots, he thought.\\n\\n The poker moved in, but Wulfgar set the gaoler with such a calm and devastating stare, a look borne of the barbarian\u0027s supreme confidence that this man-that all these foolish mortal men-could do nothing to him to rival the agonies he had suffered at the clawed hands of the demon Errtu.\\n\\n The gaoler apparently got that message, or a similar one, for he hesitated, even backed the poker up so he could more clearly view Wulfgar\u0027s set expression.\\n\\n \"Ye think ye can hold it?\" the brutal torturer asked Wulfgar. \"Ye think ye can keep yer face all stuck like that when I pokes yer eye?\" And on he came again.\\n\\n Wulfgar gave a growl that came from somewhere very, very deep within, a feral, primal sound that stole the words from Morik\u0027s mouth as the little thief was about to protest. A growl that came from his torment in the pits of the Abyss.\\n\\n The barbarian swelled his chest mightily, gathered his strength, and drove one shoulder forward with such ferocity and speed that the shackle anchor exploded from the wall, sending the stunned gaoler skittering back.\\n\\n \"Oh, but I\u0027ll kill ye for that!\" the half-ogre cried, and he came ahead brandishing the poker like a club.\\n\\n Wulfgar was ready for him. The barbarian coiled about, almost turning to face the wall, then swung his free arm wide, the chain and block of metal and stone fixed to its other end swishing across to clip the glowing poker and tear it from the gaoler\u0027s hand. Again the brute skittered back, and this time Wulfgar turned back on the wall fully, running his legs right up it so that he had his feet planted firmly, one on either side of the remaining shackle.\\n\\n \"Knock all the walls down!\" Morik cheered.\\n\\n The gaoler turned and ran.\\n\\n Another growl came from Wulfgar, and he pulled with all his strength, every muscle in his powerful body straining. This anchor was more secure than the last, the stone wall more solid about it, but so great was Wulfgar\u0027s pull that a link in the heavy chain began to separate.\\n\\n \"Pull on!\" Morik cried.\\n\\n Wulfgar did, and he was sailing out from the wall, spinning into a back somersault. He tumbled down, unhurt, but then it hit him, a wave of anguish more powerful than any torture the sadistic gaoler might bring. In his mind he was no longer in the dungeon of Luskan but back in the Abyss, and though no shackles now held him he knew there could be no escape, no victory over his too-powerful captors. How many times had Errtu played this trick on him, making him think he was free only to snare him and drag him back to the stench and filth, only to beat him, then heal him, and beat him some more?\\n\\n \"Wulfgar?\" Morik begged repeatedly, pulling at his own shackles, though with no results at all. \"Wulfgar!\"\\n\\n The barbarian couldn\u0027t hear him, couldn\u0027t even see him, so lost was he in the swirling fog of his own thoughts. Wulfgar curled up on the floor, trembling like a babe when the gaoler returned with a dozen comrades.\\n\\n A short while later, the beaten Wulfgar was hanging again from the wall, this time in shackles meant for a giant, thick and solid chains that had his feet, dangling several feet from the floor and his arms stretched out straight to the side. As an extra precaution a block of sharpened spikes had been set behind the barbarian so if he pulled hard he would impale himself rather than tug the chains from their anchors. He was in a different chamber now, far removed from Morik. He was all alone with his memories of the Abyss, with no place to hide, no bottle to take him away.\\n\\n \"It should be working,\" the old woman grumbled. \"Right herbs fer de poison.\"\\n\\n Three priests walked back and forth in the room, one muttering prayers, another going from one side of Captain Deudermont to the other, listening for breath, for a heartbeat, checking for a pulse, while the third just kept rubbing his hand over his tightly cropped hair.\\n\\n \"But it is not working,\" Robillard argued, and he looked to the priests for some help.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" said Camerbunne, the ranking cleric among the trio. \"It resists our spells and even a powerful herbal antidote.\"\\n\\n \"And wit some o\u0027 de poison in hand, it should be workin\u0027,\" said the old woman.\\n\\n \"If that is indeed some of the poison,\" Robillard remarked.\\n\\n \"You yourself took it from the little one called Morik,\" Camerbunne explained.\\n\\n \"That does not necessarily mean . . .\" Robillard started to reply. He let the thought hang in the air. The expressions on the faces of his four companions told him well enough that they had caught on. \"What do we do, then?\" the wizard asked.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027no be promisin\u0027 anything,\" the old woman claimed, throwing up her hands dramatically. \"Wit none o\u0027 de poison, me herbs\u0027ll do what dey will.\"\\n\\n She moved to the side of the room, where they had placed a small table to act as her workbench, and began fiddling with different vials and jars and bottles. Robillard looked to Camerbunne. The man returned a defeated expression. The clerics had worked tirelessly over Deudermont in the day he had been in their care, casting spells that should have neutralized the vicious poison flowing through him. Those spells had provided temporary relief only, slowing the poison and allowing the captain to breath more easily and lowering his fever a bit, at least. Deudermont had not opened his eyes since the attack. Soon after, the captain\u0027s breathing went back to raspy, and he began bleeding again from his gums and his eyes. Robillard was no healer, but he had seen enough death to understand that if they did not come up with something soon, his beloved Captain Deudermont would fade away.\\n\\n \"Evil poison,\" Camerbunne remarked.\\n\\n \"It is an herb, no doubt,\" Robillard said. \"Neither evil nor malicious. It just is what it is.\"\\n\\n Camerbunne shook his head. \"There is a touch of magic about it, do not doubt, good wizard,\" he declared. \"Our spells will defeat any natural poison. No, this one has been specially prepared by a master and with the help of dark magic.\"\\n\\n \"Then what can we do?\" the wizard asked.\\n\\n \"We can keep casting our spells over him to try and offer as much comfort as possible and hope that the poison works its way out of him,\" Camerbunne explained. \"We can hope that old Gretchen finds the right mixture of herbs.\"\\n\\n \"Easier it\u0027d be if I had a bit o\u0027 the poison,\" old Gretchen complained.\\n\\n \"And we can pray,\" Camerbunne finished.\\n\\n The last statement brought a frown to the atheistic Robillard. He was a man of logic and specified rules and did not indulge in prayer.\\n\\n \"I will go to Morik the Rogue and learn more of the poison,\" Robillard said with a snarl.\\n\\n \"He has been tortured already,\" Camerbunne assured the wizard. \"I doubt that he knows anything at all. It is merely something he purchased on the street, no doubt.\"\\n\\n \"Tortured?\" Robillard replied skeptically. \"A thumbscrew, a rack? No, that is not torture. That is a sadistic game and nothing more. The art of torture becomes ever more exquisite when magic is applied.\" He started for the door, but Camerbunne caught him by the arm.\\n\\n \"Morik will not know,\" he said again, staring soberly into the outraged wizard\u0027s hollowed eyes. \"Stay with us. Stay with your captain. He may not survive the night, and if he does come out of the sleep before he dies, it would be better if he found a friend waiting for him.\"\\n\\n Robillard had no argument against that heavy-handed comment, so he sighed and moved back to his chair, plopping down.\\n\\n A short while later, a city guardsman knocked and entered the room, the routine call from the magistrate.\\n\\n \"Tell Jerem Boll and old Jharkheld that the charge against Wulfgar and Morik will likely be heinous murder,\" Camerbunne quietly explained.\\n\\n Robillard heard the priest, and the words sank his heart even lower. It didn\u0027t matter much to Wulfgar and Morik what charge was placed against them. Either way, whether it was heinous murder or intended murder, they would be executed, though with the former the process would take much longer, to the pleasure of the crowd at the Prisoner\u0027s Carnival.\\n\\n Watching them die would be of little satisfaction to Robillard, though, if his beloved captain did not survive. He put his head in his hands, considering again that he should go to Morik and punish the man with spell after spell until he broke down and revealed the type of poison that had been used.\\n\\n Camerbunne was right, Robillard knew, for he understood city thieves like Morik the Rogue. Certainly Morik hadn\u0027t brewed the poison but had merely gotten some of it from a well-paid source.\\n\\n The wizard lifted his head from his hands, a look of revelation on his haggard face. He remembered the two men who had been in the Cutlass before Wulfgar and Morik had arrived, the two men who had gone to the boy who had subsequently run off to find Wulfgar and Morik, the grimy sailor and his exotic, tattooed companion. He remembered Leaping Lady, sailing out fast from Luskan\u0027s harbor. Had Wulfgar and Morik traded the barbarian\u0027s marvelous warhammer for the poison to kill Deudermont?\\n\\n Robillard sprang up from his chair, not certain of where to begin, but thinking now that he was on to something important. Someone, either the pair who had signaled Deudermont\u0027s arrival, the street urchin they had paid to go get Wulfgar and Morik, or someone on Leaping Lady, knew the secrets of the poison.\\n\\n Robillard took another look at his poor, bedraggled captain, so obviously near to death. He stormed out of the room, determined to get some answers. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-10.html","bookId":2132,"book":{"id":2132,"title":"The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2)","description":"Storyline: The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2) \\n Spending time in the unimaginable torture chambers of the Abyss for even a day would be enough to break even the heartiest soul, and the barbarian Wulfgar was there for years.
