{"id":94552,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"He knew you,\" Morik dared to say after he had rejoined Wulfgar very late that same night following his venture to the seedy drinking hole. By the time the rogue had caught up to his friend on the docks the big man had drained almost all of the second bottle. \"And you knew him.\"\n \"He thought he knew me,\" Wulfgar corrected, slurring each word.\n He was hardly able to sit without wobbling, obviously more drunk than usual for so early an hour. He and Morik had split up outside the Cutlass, with Wulfgar taking the two bottles. Instead of going straight to the docks the barbarian had wandered the streets and soon found himself in the more exclusive section of Luskan, the area of respectable folk and merchants. No city guards had come to chase him off, for in that area of town stood the Prisoner\u0027s Carnival, a public platform where outlaws were openly punished. A thief was up on the stage this night, asked repeatedly by the torturer if he admitted his crime. When he did not, the torturer took out a pair of heavy shears and snipped off his little finger. The thief\u0027s answer to the repeated question brought howls of approval from the scores of people watching the daily spectacle.\n Of course, admitting to the crime was no easy way out for the poor man. He lost his whole hand, one finger at a time, the mob cheering and hooting with glee.\n But not Wulfgar. No, the sight had proven too much for the barbarian, had catapulted him back in time, back to Errtu\u0027s Abyss and the helpless agony. What tortures he had known there! He had been cut and whipped and beaten within an inch of his life, only to be restored by the healing magic of one of Errtu\u0027s foul minions. He\u0027d had his fingers bitten off and put back again.\n The sight of the unfortunate thief brought all that back to him vividly now.\n The anvil. Yes, that was the worst of all, the most agonizing physical torture Errtu had devised for him, reserved for those moments when the great demon was in such a fit of rage that he could not take the time to devise a more subtle, more crushing, mental torture.\n The anvil. Cold it was, like a block of ice, so cold that it seemed like fire to Wulfgar\u0027s thighs when Errtu\u0027s mighty minions pulled him across it, forced him to straddle it, naked and stretched out on his back.\n Errtu would come to him then, slowly, menacingly, would walk right up before him, and in a single, sudden movement, smash a small mallet set with tiny needles down into Wulfgar\u0027s opened eyes, exploding them and washing waves of nausea and agony through the barbarian.\n And, of course, Errtu\u0027s minions would heal him, would make him whole again that their fun might be repeated.\n Even now, long fled from Errtu\u0027s abyssal home, Wulfgar often awoke, curled like a baby, clutching his eyes, feeling the agony. Wulfgar knew of only one escape from the pain. Thus, he had taken his bottles and run away, and only by swallowing the fiery liquid had he blurred that memory.\n \"Thought he knew you?\" Morik asked doubtfully.\n Wulfgar stared at him blankly.\n \"The man in the Cutlass,\" Morik explained.\n \"He was mistaken,\" Wulfgar slurred.\n Morik flashed him a skeptical look.\n \"He know who I once was,\" the big man admitted. \"Not who I am.\"\n \"Deudermont,\" Morik reasoned.\n Now it was Wulfgar\u0027s turn to look surprised. Morik knew most of the folk of Luskan, of course-the rogue survived through information-but it surprised Wulfgar that he knew of an obscure sailor (which is what Wulfgar thought Deudermont to be) merely visiting the port.\n \"Captain Deudermont of the Sea Sprite,\" Morik explained. \"Much known and much feared by the pirates of the Sword Coast. He knew you, and you knew him.\"\n \"I sailed with him once . . . a lifetime ago,\" Wulfgar admitted.\n \"I have many friends, profiteers of the sea, who would pay handsomely to see that one eliminated,\" Morik remarked, bending low over the seated Wulfgar. \"Perhaps we could use your familiarity with this man to some advantage.\"\n Even as the words left Morik\u0027s mouth, Wulfgar came up fast and hard, his hand going about Morik\u0027s throat. Staggering on unsteady legs, Wulfgar still had the strength in just that one arm to lift the rogue from the ground. A fast few strides, as much a fall as a run, brought them hard against the wall of a warehouse where Wulfgar pinned Morik the Rogue, whose feet dangled several inches above the ground.\n Morik\u0027s hand went into a deep pocket, closing on a nasty knife, one that he knew he could put into the drunken Wulfgar\u0027s heart in an instant. He held his thrust, though, for Wulfgar did not press in any longer, did not try to injure him. Besides, there remained those nagging memories of drow elves holding an interest in Wulfgar. How would Morik explain killing the man to them? What would happen to the rogue if he didn\u0027t manage to finish the job?\n \"If ever you ask that of me again, I will-\" Wulfgar left the threat unfinished, dropping Morik. He spun back to the sea, nearly overbalancing and tumbling from the pier in his drunken rush.\n Morik rubbed a hand across his bruised throat, momentarily stunned by the explosive outburst. When he thought about it, though, he merely nodded. He had touched on a painful wound, one opened by the unexpected appearance of Wulfgar\u0027s old companion, Deudermont. It was the classic struggle of past and present, Morik knew, for he had seen it tear men apart time and again as they went about their descent to the bottom of a bottle. The feelings brought on by the sight of the captain, the man with whom he had once sailed, were too raw for Wulfgar. The barbarian couldn\u0027t put his present state in accord with what he had once been. Morik smiled and let it go, recognizing clearly that the emotional fight, past against present, was far from finished for his large friend.\n Perhaps the present would win out, and Wulfgar would listen to Morik\u0027s potentially profitable proposition concerning Deudermont. Or, if not, maybe Morik would act independently and use Wulfgar\u0027s familiarity with the man to his own gain without Wulfgar\u0027s knowledge.\n Morik forgave Wulfgar for attacking him. This time. . . .\n \"Would you like to sail with him again, then?\" Morik asked, deliberately lightening his tone.\n Wulfgar plopped to a sitting position, then stared incredulously through blurry eyes at the rogue.\n \"We must keep our purses full,\" Morik reminded him. \"You do seem to be growing bored with Arumn and the Cutlass. Perhaps a few months at sea-\"\n Wulfgar waved him to silence, then turned about and spat into the sea. A moment later, he bent low over the dock and vomited.\n Morik looked upon him with a mixture of pity, disgust, and anger. Yes, the rogue knew then and there he would get to Deudermont, whether Wulfgar went along with the plan or not. The rogue would use his friend to find a weakness in the infamous captain of Sea Sprite. A pang of guilt hit Morik as he came to that realization. Wulfgar was his friend, after all, but this was the street, and a wise man would not pass up so obvious an opportunity to grab a pot of gold.\n \"You stink Morik get done it?\" the tattooed pirate, Tee-a-nicknick, asked first thing when he awoke in an alley.\n Next to him among the trash, Creeps Sharky looked over curiously, then deciphered the words. \"Think, my friend, not stink,\" he corrected.\n \"You stink him done it?\"\n Propped on one elbow, Creeps snorted and looked away, his one-eyed gaze drifting about the fetid alley.\n With no answer apparently forthcoming, Tee-a-nicknick swatted Creeps Sharky hard across the back of his head.\n \"What\u0027re you about?\" the other pirate complained, trying to turn around but merely falling face down on the ground, then slowly rolling to his back to glare at his exotic half-qullan companion.\n \"Morik done it?\" Tee-a-nicknick asked. \"Kill Deudermont?\"\n Creeps coughed up a ball of phlegm and managed, with great effort, to move to a sitting position. \"Bah,\" he snorted doubtfully. \"Morik\u0027s a sneaky one, to be sure, but he\u0027s out of his pond with Deudermont. More likely the captain\u0027ll be taking that one down.\"\n \"Ten thousand,\" Tee-a-nicknick said with great lament, for he and Creeps, in circulating the notion that Deudermont might be taken down before Sea Sprite ever left Luskan, had secured promises of nearly ten thousand gold pieces in bounty money, funds they knew the offering pirates would gladly pay for the completed deed. Creeps and Tee-a-nicknick had already decided that should Morik finish the task, they would pay him seven of the ten, keeping three for themselves.\n \"I been thinking that maybe Morik\u0027ll set up Deudermont well enough,\" Creeps went on. \"Might be that the little rat\u0027ll play a part without knowing he\u0027s playing it. If Deudermont\u0027s liking Morik\u0027s friend, then Deudermont might be letting down his guard a bit too much.\"\n \"You stink we do it?\" Tee-a-nicknick asked, sounding intrigued.\n Creeps eyed his friend. He chuckled at the half-qullan\u0027s continuing struggles with the language, though Tee-a-nicknick had been sailing with humans for most of his life, ever since he had been plucked from an island as a youth. His own people, the savage eight-foot-tall qullans were intolerant of mixed blood and had abandoned him as inferior.\n Tee-a-nicknick gave a quick blow, ending in a smile, and Creeps Sharky didn\u0027t miss the reference. No pirate in any sea could handle a certain weapon, a long hollow tube that the tattooed pirate called a blowgun, better than Tee-a-nicknick. Creeps had seen his friend shoot a fly from the rail from across a wide ship\u0027s deck. Tee-a-nicknick also had a substantial understanding of poisons, a legacy of his life with the exotic qullans, Creeps believed, to tip the cat\u0027s claws he sometimes used as blowgun missiles. Poisons human clerics could not understand and counter.\n One well-placed shot could make Creeps and Tee-a-nicknick wealthy men indeed, perhaps even wealthy enough to secure their own ship.\n \"You got a particularly nasty poison for Mister Deudermont?\" Creeps asked.\n The tattooed half-qullan smiled. \"You stink we do it,\" he stated.\n Arumn Gardpeck sighed when he saw the damage done to the door leading to the guest wing of the Cutlass. The hinges had been twisted so that the door no longer stood straight within its jamb. Now it tilted and wouldn\u0027t even close properly.\n \"A foul mood again,\" observed Josi Puddles, standing behind the tavernkeeper. \"A foul mood today, a foul mood tomorrow. Always a foul mood for that one.\"\n Arumn ignored the man and moved along the hallway to the door of Delly Curtie\u0027s room. He put his ear against the wood and heard soft sobbing from within.\n \"Pushed her out again,\" Josi spat. \"Ah, the dog.\"\n Arumn glared at the little man, though his thoughts weren\u0027t far different. Josi\u0027s whining didn\u0027t shake the tavernkeeper in the least. He recognized that the man had developed a particular sore spot against Wulfgar, one based mostly on jealousy, the emotion that always seemed to rule Josi\u0027s actions. The sobs of Delly Curtie cut deeply into troubled Arumn, who had come to think of the girl as his own daughter. At first, he had been thrilled by the budding relationship between Delly and Wulfgar, despite the protests of Josi, who had been enamored of the girl for years. Now those protests seemed to hold a bit of truth in them, for Wulfgar\u0027s actions toward Delly of late had brought a bitter taste to Arumn\u0027s mouth.\n \"He\u0027s costin\u0027 ye more than he\u0027s bringin\u0027 in,\" Josi went on, skipping to keep up with Arumn as the big man made his way determinedly toward Wulfgar\u0027s door at the end of the hall, \"breakin\u0027 so much, and an honest fellow won\u0027t come into the Cutlass anymore. Too afraid to get his head busted.\"\n Arumn stopped at the door and turned pointedly on Josi. \"Shut yer mouth,\" he instructed plainly and firmly. He turned back and lifted his hand as if to knock, but he changed his mind and pushed right through the door. Wulfgar lay sprawled on the bed, still in his clothes and smelling of liquor.\n \"Always the drink,\" Arumn lamented. The sadness in his voice was indeed genuine, for despite all his anger at Wulfgar, Arumn couldn\u0027t dismiss his own responsibility in this situation. He had introduced the troubled barbarian to the bottle, but he hadn\u0027t recognized the depth of the big man\u0027s despair. The barkeep understood it now, the sheer desperation in Wulfgar to escape the agony of his recent past.\n \"What\u0027re ye thinking to do?\" Josi asked.\n Arumn ignored him and moved to the bed to give Wulfgar a rough shake. After a second, then a third shake the barbarian lifted his head and turned it to face Arumn, though his eyes were hardly open.\n \"Ye\u0027re done here,\" Arumn said plainly and calmly, shaking Wulfgar again. \"I cannot let ye do this to me place and me friends no more. Ye gather all yer things tonight and be on yer way, wherever that road might take ye, for I\u0027m not wanting to see ye in the common room. I\u0027ll put a bag o\u0027 coins inside yer door to help ye get set up somewhere else. I\u0027m owin\u0027 ye that much, at least.\"\n Wulfgar didn\u0027t respond.\n \"Ye hearin\u0027 me?\" Arumn asked.\n Wulfgar nodded and grumbled for Arumn to go away, a request heightened by a wave of the barbarian\u0027s arm, which, as sluggish as Wulfgar was, still easily and effectively pushed Arumn back from the bed.\n Another sigh, another shake of his head, and Arumn left. Josi Puddles spent a long moment studying the huge man on the bed and the room around him and particularly the magnificent warhammer resting against the wall in the far corner.\n \"I owe it to him,\" Captain Deudermont said to Robillard, the two standing at the rail of the docked, nearly repaired Sea Sprite.\n \"Because he once sailed with you?\" the wizard asked skeptically.\n \"More than sailed.\"\n \"He performed a service for your vessel, true enough,\" Robillard reasoned, \"but did you not reciprocate? You took him and his friends all the way to Memnon and back.\"\n Deudermont bowed his head in contemplation, then looked up at the wizard. \"I owe it to him not out of any financial or business arrangement,\" he explained, \"but because we became friends.\"\n \"You hardly knew him.\"\n \"But I know Drizzt Do\u0027Urden and Catti-brie,\" Deudermont argued. \"How many years did they sail with me? Do you deny our friendship?\"\n \"But-\"\n \"How can you so quickly deny my responsibility?\" Deudermont asked.\n \"He is neither Drizzt nor Catti-brie,\" Robillard replied.\n \"No, but he is a dear friend of both and a man in great need.\"\n \"Who doesn\u0027t want your help,\" finished the wizard.\n Deudermont bowed his head again, considering the words. They seemed true enough. Wulfgar had, indeed, denied his offers of help. Given the barbarian\u0027s state, the captain had to admit, privately, that chances were slim he could say or do anything to bring the big man from his downward spiral.\n \"I must try,\" he said a moment later, not bothering to look up.\n Robillard didn\u0027t bother to argue the point. The wizard understood, from the captain\u0027s determined tone, that it was not his place to do so. He had been hired to protect Deudermont, and so he would do just that. Still, by his estimation, the sooner Sea Sprite was out of Luskan and far, far from this Wulfgar fellow, the better off they would all be.\n He was conscious of the sound of his breathing, gasping actually, for he was as scared as he had ever been. One slip, one inadvertent noise, would wake the giant, and he doubted any of the feeble explanations he\u0027d concocted would save him then.\n Something greater than fear prodded Josi Puddles along. More than anything, he had come to hate this man. Wulfgar had taken Delly from him-from his fantasies, at least. Wulfgar had enamored himself of Arumn, replacing Josi at the tavernkeeper\u0027s side. Wulfgar could bring complete ruin to the Cutlass, the only home Josi Puddles had ever known.\n Josi didn\u0027t believe that the huge, wrathful barbarian would take Arumn\u0027s orders to leave without a fight, and Josi had seen enough of the brawling man to understand just how devastating that fight might become. Josi also understood that if it came to blows in the Cutlass, he would likely prove a prime target for Wulfgar\u0027s wrath.\n He cracked open the door. Wulfgar lay on the bed in almost exactly the same position as he had been when Josi and Arumn had come there two hours earlier.\n Aegis-fang leaned against the wall in the far corner. Josi shuddered at the sight, imagining the mighty warhammer spinning his way.\n The little man crept into the room and paused to consider the small bag of coins Arumn had left to the side of the door beside Wulfgar\u0027s bed. Drawing out a large knife, he put his fingertip to the barbarian\u0027s back, just under the shoulder-blade, feeling for a heartbeat, then replaced his fingertip with the tip of the knife. All he had to do was lean on it hard, he told himself. All he had to do was drive the knife through Wulfgar\u0027s heart, and his troubles would be at their end. The Cutlass would survive as it had before this demon had come to Luskan, and Delly Curtie would be his for the taking.\n He leaned over the blade. Wulfgar stirred, but just barely, the big man very far from consciousness.\n What if he missed the mark? Josi thought with sudden panic. What if his thrust only wounded the big man? The image of a roaring Wulfgar leaping from the bed to corner a would-be assassin sapped the strength from Josi\u0027s knees, and he nearly fell over the sleeping barbarian. The little man skittered back from the bed and turned for the door, trying not to cry out in fright.\n He composed himself and remembered his fears for the expected scene of that night, when Wulfgar would come down to confront Arumn, when the barbarian and that terrible warhammer would take down the Cutlass and everyone in the place.\n Before he could even consider the action, Josi rushed across the room and, with great effort, hoisted the heavy hammer, cradling it like a baby. He ran out of the room and out the inn\u0027s back door.\n \"Ye shouldn\u0027t\u0027ve brought \u0027em,\" Arumn scolded Josi Puddles again. Even as he finished, the door separating the common room from the private quarters swung open and a haggard-looking Wulfgar walked in.\n \"A foul mood,\" Josi remarked, as if that was vindication against Arumn\u0027s scolding. Josi had invited a few friends to the Cutlass that night, a thick-limbed rogue named Reef and his equally tough friends, including one thin man with soft hands-not a fighter, to be sure-whom Arumn believed he had seen before but in flowing robes and not breeches and a tunic. Reef had a score to settle against Wulfgar, for on the first day the barbarian arrived in the Cutlass Reef and a couple of his friends were working as Arumn\u0027s bouncers. When they tried to forcefully remove Wulfgar from the tavern, the barbarian had slapped Reef across the room.\n Arumn\u0027s glare did not diminish. He was somewhat surprised to see Wulfgar in the tavern, but still he wanted to handle this with words alone. A fight with an outraged Wulfgar could cost the proprietor greatly.\n The crowd in the common room went into a collective hush as Wulfgar made his way across the floor. Staring suspiciously at Arumn, the big man plopped a bag of coins on the bar.\n \"It\u0027s all I can give to ye,\" Arumn remarked, recognizing the bag as the one he had left for Wulfgar.\n \"Who asked for it?\" Wulfgar replied, sounding as if he had no idea what was going on.\n \"It\u0027s what I told ye,\" Arumn started, then stopped and patted his hands in the air as if trying to calm Wulfgar down, though in truth, the mighty barbarian didn\u0027t seem the least bit agitated.\n \"Ye\u0027re not to stay here anymore,\" Arumn explained. \"I can\u0027t be having it.\"\n Wulfgar didn\u0027t respond other than to glare intensely at the tavernkeeper.\n \"Now, I\u0027m wanting no trouble,\" Arumn explained, again patting his hands in the air.\n Wulfgar wouldn\u0027t have given him any, though the big man was surely in a foul mood. He noticed a movement from Josi Puddles, obviously a signal, and half a dozen powerful men, including a couple Wulfgar recognized as Arumn\u0027s old crew, formed a semicircle around the huge man.\n \"No trouble!\" Arumn said more forcefully, aiming his remark more at Josi\u0027s hunting pack than at Wulfgar.\n \"Aegis-fang,\" Wulfgar muttered.\n A few seats down the bar, Josi stiffened and prayed that he had placed the hammer safely out of Wulfgar\u0027s magical calling range.\n A moment passed; the warhammer did not materialize in Wulfgar\u0027s hand.\n \"It\u0027s in yer room,\" Arumn offered.\n With a sudden, vicious movement, Wulfgar slapped the bag of coins away, sending them clattering across the floor. \"Are you thinking that to be ample payment?\"\n \"More than I owe ye,\" Arumn dared to argue.\n \"A few coins for Aegis-fang?\" Wulfgar asked incredulously.\n \"Not for the warhammer,\" Arumn stuttered, sensing that the situation was deteriorating very fast. \"That\u0027s in yer room.\"\n \"If it were in my room, then I would have seen it,\" Wulfgar replied, leaning forward threateningly. Josi\u0027s hunting pack closed in just a bit, two of them taking out small clubs, a third wrapping a chain about his fist. \"Even if I did not see it, it would have come to my call from there,\" Wulfgar reasoned, and he called again, yelling this time, \"Aegis-fang!\"\n Nothing.\n \"Where is my hammer?\" Wulfgar demanded of Arumn.\n \"Just leave, Wulfgar,\" the tavernkeeper pleaded. \"Just be gone. If we find yer hammer, we\u0027ll get it brought to ye, but go now.\"\n Wulfgar saw it coming, so he baited it in. He reached across the bar for Arumn\u0027s throat, then pulled up short and snapped his arm back, catching the attacker coming in at his right flank, Reef, square in the face with a flying elbow. Reef staggered and wobbled, until Wulfgar pumped his arm and slammed him again, sending him flying away.\n Purely on instinct, the barbarian spun back and threw his left arm up defensively. Just in time as one of Reef\u0027s cronies came in hard, swinging a short, thick club that smashed Wulfgar hard on the forearm.\n All semblance of strategy and posturing disappeared in the blink of an eye, as all five of the thugs charged at Wulfgar. The barbarian began kicking and swinging his mighty fists, yelling out for Aegis-fang repeatedly and futilely. He even snapped his head forward viciously several times, connecting solidly with an attacker\u0027s nose, then again, catching another man on the side of the head and sending him staggering away.\n Delly Curtie screamed, and Arumn cried \"No!\" repeatedly.\n But Wulfgar couldn\u0027t hear them. Even if he could, he could not have taken a moment to heed the command. He had to buy some time and some room, for he was taking three hits for every one he was delivering in these close quarters. Though his punches and kicks were heavier by far, Reef\u0027s friends were no novices to brawling.\n The rest of the Cutlass\u0027s patrons stared at the row in amusement and confusion, for they knew that Wulfgar worked for Arumn. The only ones moving were skidding safely out of range of the whirling ball of brawlers. One man in the far corner stood up, waving his arms wildly and spinning in circles.\n \"They\u0027re attacking the Cutlass crew!\" the man cried. \"To arms, patrons and friends! Defend Arumn and Wulfgar! Surely these thugs will destroy our tavern!\"\n \"By the gods,\" Arumn Gardpeck muttered, for he knew the speaker, knew that Morik the Rogue had just condemned his precious establishment to devastation. With a shake of his head and a frustrated groan, the helpless Arumn ducked down behind the bar.\n As if on cue, the entire Cutlass exploded into a huge brawl. Men and women, howling and taking no time to sort out allegiance, were just punching at the nearest potential victim.\n Still at the bar, Wulfgar had to leave his right flank exposed, taking a brutal slug across the jaw, for he was focusing on the left, where the man with the club came at him yet again. He got his hands up to deflect the first strike and the second, then stepped toward the man, accepting a smack across the ribs, but catching the attacker by the forearm. Holding tightly Wulfgar shoved the man away, then yanked him powerfully back in, ducking and snapping his free hand into the staggering man\u0027s crotch. The man went high into the air, Wulfgar pressing him up to the limit of his reach and turning a quick circle, seeking a target.\n The man flew away, hitting another, both of them falling into poor Reef and sending the big man sprawling once again.\n Yet another attacker came hard at Wulfgar, arm cocked to punch. The barbarian steeled his gaze and his jaw, ready to trade hit for hit, but this ruffian had a chain wrapped around his fist. A flash of burning pain exploded on Wulfgar\u0027s face, and the taste of blood came thick in his mouth. Out pumped the dazed Wulfgar\u0027s arm, his fist just clipping the attacker\u0027s shoulder.\n Another man dipped his shoulder in full charge, slamming Wulfgar\u0027s side, but the braced barbarian didn\u0027t budge. A second chain-wrapped punch came at his face-he saw the links gleaming red with his own blood-but he managed to duck the brunt of this one, though he still got a fair-sized gash across his cheek.\n The other man, who had bounced off him harmlessly, leaped onto Wulfgar\u0027s side with a heavy flying tackle, but Wulfgar, with a defiant roar, held fast his footing. He twisted and wriggled his left arm up under the clinging man\u0027s shoulder and grabbed him by the hair on the back of his head.\n Ahead strode the barbarian, roaring, punching again and again with his free right hand, while tugging with his left to keep the clinging man in check. The chain-fisted ruffian backed defensively, using his left arm to deflect the blows. He saw an opening he couldn\u0027t resist and came forward hard to land another solid blow on Wulfgar, clipping the barbarian\u0027s collar bone. The ruffian should have continued retreating, though, for Wulfgar had his footing and his balance now, enough to put all his weight behind one great hooking right.\n The chain-fisted ruffian\u0027s blocking arm barely deflected the heavy blow. Wulfgar\u0027s fist smashed through the defenses and came crashing down against the side of the ruffian\u0027s face, spinning him in a downward spiral to the floor.\n Morik sat at his table in the far corner, every now and then dodging a flying bottle or body, unperturbed as he sipped his drink. Despite his calm facade, the rogue was worried for his friend and for the Cutlass, for he could not believe the brutality of the row this night. It seemed as if all of Luskan\u0027s thugs had risen up in this one great opportunity to brawl in a tavern that had been relatively fight-free since Wulfgar had arrived, scaring off or quickly beating up any potential ruffians.\n Morik winced as the chain slammed into Wulfgar\u0027s face, splattering blood. The rogue considered going to his friend\u0027s aid, but he quickly dismissed the notion. Morik was a clever information gatherer, a thief who survived through his wiles and his weapons, neither of which would help him in a common tavern brawl.\n So he sat at his table, watching the tumult around him. Nearly everyone in the common room was into it now. One man came by, dragging a woman by her long, dark hair, heading for the door. He had hardly gone past Morik, though, when another man smashed a chair over his head, dropping him to the floor.\n When that rescuer turned to the woman, she promptly smashed a bottle across the smile on his face, then turned and ran back to the melee, leaping atop one man and bearing him down, her fingernails raking his face.\n Morik studied the woman more intently, marking well her features and thinking that her feisty spirit might prove quite enjoyable in some future private engagement.\n Seeing movement from his right, Morik moved fast to slide his chair back and lift both his mug and bottle as two men came sailing across his table, smashing it and taking away the pieces with their brawl.\n Morik merely shrugged, crossed his legs, leaned against the wall, and took another sip.\n Wulfgar found a temporary reprieve after dropping the chain-fisted man, but another quickly took his place, pressing in harder, hanging on Wulfgar\u0027s side. He finally gave up trying to wrestle away the powerful barbarian\u0027s arm. Instead he latched onto Wulfgar\u0027s face with two clawing hands and tried to pull the barbarian\u0027s head toward him, biting at his ear.\n Yelping with pain, roaring with outrage, Wulfgar yanked hard on the man\u0027s hair, jerking his head and a small piece of Wulfgar\u0027s ear away. Wulfgar brought his right hand under the man\u0027s left arm, rolled it over and out, twisting the arm until breaking the hold on Wulfgar\u0027s shirt. He grabbed hard to the inside of the man\u0027s biceps. A twist turned Wulfgar square to the bar, and he drove both his arms down toward it hard, slamming the man\u0027s head against the wood so forcefully that the planking cracked. Wulfgar pulled the man back up. Hardly noticing that all struggling had abruptly ceased, Wulfgar slammed him facedown into the wood again. With a great shrug followed by a greater roar, Wulfgar sent the unconscious thug flying away. He spun about, preparing for the next round of attacks.\n Wulfgar\u0027s blood-streaked eyes focused briefly. He couldn\u0027t believe the tumult. It seemed as if all the world had gone mad. Tables and bodies flew. Practically everyone in the place, near to a hundred patrons this night, was into the brawl. Across the way Wulfgar spotted Morik where he sat quietly leaning against the far wall, shifting his legs now and then to avoid whatever flew past them. Morik noticed him and lifted his glass cordially.\n Wulfgar ducked and braced. A man, chopping a heavy board down at Wulfgar\u0027s head, went rolling over the barbarian\u0027s back.\n Wulfgar spotted Delly then, rushing across the room, ducking for cover where she could and calling out for him. She was halfway across the inn from him when a flying chair cracked across the side of her head, dropping her straight down.\n Wulfgar started for her, but another man came at the distracted barbarian hard and low, crunching him across the knees. The barbarian fought to hold his balance, staggered once, then another man leaped onto his back. The man below him grabbed an ankle in a two-armed hug and rolled around, twisting Wulfgar\u0027s leg. A third man rammed him full speed, and over they all went, falling down in a jumble of flailing arms and kicking legs.\n Wulfgar rolled atop the last attacker, slamming his forearm down across the man\u0027s face and using that as leverage to try to rise, but a heavy boot stomped on his back. He went down hard, his breath blasted away. The unseen attacker above him tried to stomp him again, but Wulfgar kept the presence of mind to roll aside, and the attacker wound up stepping on his own comrade\u0027s exposed belly.\n The abrupt shift only reminded Wulfgar that he still had a man hanging tough onto his ankle. The barbarian kicked at him with his free leg, but he had no leverage, lying on his back as he was, and so he went into a jerking, thrashing frenzy, trying desperately to pull free.\n The man held on stubbornly, mostly because he was too scared to let go. Wulfgar took a different tact, drawing his leg up and taking the man along for the slide, then kicking straight out again, bringing his trapped foot somewhat below his opponent\u0027s grasp. At the same time, the barbarian snapped his other leg around the back of the man and managed to hook his ankles together.\n A second thug jumped atop the barbarian, grabbing one arm and bringing it down under his weight while a third did likewise to the other arm. Wulfgar fought them savagely, twisting his arms. When that didn\u0027t work, he simply growled and pushed straight up, locking his arms in right angles at the elbows and drawing them up and together above his massive chest. At the same time, Wulfgar squeezed with his powerful legs. The man fought frantically against the vice and tried to cry out, but the only sound that came from him was the loud snap as his shoulder popped out of its socket.\n Feeling the struggling ended down below, Wulfgar wriggled his legs free and kicked and kicked until the groaning man rolled away. The barbarian turned his attention to the two above who were punching and scratching him. With strength that mocked mortal men, Wulfgar extended his arms, lifting both the ruffians up to arms\u0027 length, then pulling them up above his head suddenly, at the same time rolling his legs up with a jerk. The momentum sent Wulfgar right over backward, and he managed to push off with his hands as he came around, landing unsteadily on his feet, facing the two prone and scrambling men.\n Instinct alone spun the barbarian around to meet the latest charge, his fist flying. He caught the attacker, the chain-fisted man, square in the chest. It was a tremendous collision, but Wulfgar hadn\u0027t turned fast enough to get any defense in place against the man\u0027s flying fist, which hit him square in the face at the same time. The two shuddered to a stop, and the chain-fisted man fell over into Wulfgar\u0027s arms. The barbarian brushed him aside to land heavily, facedown, far, far from consciousness.\n The blow had hurt Wulfgar badly, he knew, for his vision spun and blurred, and he had to keep reminding himself where he was. He got an arm up suddenly, but only partially deflected a flying chair, one leg spinning about to poke him hard in the forehead, which only heightened his dizziness. The fight around him was slowing now, for more men were down and groaning than still standing and punching, but Wulfgar needed another reprieve, a temporary one at least. He took the only route apparent to him, rushing to the bar and rolling over it, landing on his feet behind the barricade.\n He landed face-to-face with Arumn Gardpeck. \"Oh, but ye\u0027ve done a wonderful thing this night, now haven\u0027t ye?\" Arumn spat at him. \"A fight every night for Wulfgar, or it\u0027s not a fun one.\"\n Wulfgar grabbed the man by the front of his tunic. He pulled him up roughly from his crouch behind the bar, lifted him with ease, and slammed him hard against the back wall above the bottle shelving, destroying more than a bit of expensive stock in the process.\n \"Be glad your face is not at the end of my fist,\" the unrepentant barbarian growled.\n \"Or more, be glad ye\u0027ve not toyed with me own emotions the way ye\u0027ve burned poor Delly,\" Arumn growled right back.\n His words hurt Wulfgar profoundly, for he had no answers to Arumn\u0027s accusation, could not rightly argue that he had no blame where Delly Curtie was involved. Wulfgar gave Arumn a little jerk, then set him down and took a step back, glaring at the tavernkeeper unblinkingly. He noticed a movement to the side, and he glanced over to see a huge, disembodied fist hovering in the air above the bar.\n Wulfgar was hit on the side of the head, harder than he ever remembered being struck. He reeled, grabbing another shelf of potent whisky and pulling it down, then staggered and spun, grabbing the bar for support.\n Across from him, Josi Puddles spat in his face. Before Wulfgar could respond, he noted the magical floating hand coming at him hard from the side. He was hit again, and his legs went weak. He was hit yet again, lifted right from his feet and slammed hard into the back wall. All the world was spinning, and he felt as if he were sinking into the floor.\n He was half-carried, half-dragged, out from behind the bar and across the floor, all the fighting coming to an abrupt end at the sight of mighty Wulfgar finally defeated.\n \"Finish it outside,\" Reef said, kicking open the door. Even as the man turned for the street, he found a dagger point at his throat.\n \"It\u0027s already finished,\" Morik casually explained, though he betrayed his calm by glancing back inside toward the thin wizard who was packing up his things, apparently unconcerned by any of this. Reef had hired him as a bit of insurance. Since the wizard apparently held no personal stake in the brawl, the rogue calmed a bit and muttered under his breath, \"I hate wizards.\" He turned his attention back to Reef and dug the knife in a bit more.\n Reef looked to his companion, holding Wulfgar\u0027s other arm, and together they unceremoniously threw the barbarian into the mud.\n Wulfgar climbed back to his feet, sheer willpower alone forcing him back into a state of readiness. He turned back toward the closed door, but Morik was there, grabbing his arm.\n \"Don\u0027t,\" the rogue commanded. \"They don\u0027t want you in there. What will you prove?\"\n Wulfgar started to argue, but he looked Morik in the eye and saw no room for debate. He knew the rogue was right. He knew that he had no home. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-4.html","bookId":2132,"book":{"id":2132,"title":"The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2) \n Spending time in the unimaginable torture chambers of the Abyss for even a day would be enough to break even the heartiest soul, and the barbarian Wulfgar was there for years.
