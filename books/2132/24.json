{"id":94572,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\"Here\u0027s your last meal, dog,\" said one of the two guards standing outside Wulfgar\u0027s cell. The man spat on the food and slipped the tray in through the slot. Wulfgar ignored them and made no move for the food. He could hardly believe that he had escaped execution in Luskan, only to be killed in some nondescript fiefdom. It struck him, then, that perhaps he had earned this. No, he hadn\u0027t harmed the woman, of course, but his actions of the last months, since he had left Drizzt and the others in Icewind Dale-since ho had slapped Catti-brie across the face-were not those of a man undeserving of such a grim fate. Hadn\u0027t Wulfgar and Drizzt killed monsters for the same crimes that Wulfgar had committed? Had the pair not gone into the Spine of the World in pursuit of a giant band that had been scouting out the trail, obviously planning to waylay merchant wagons? What mercy had they shown the giants? What mercy, then, did Wulfgar deserve? Still, it bothered the big man more than a little, shook what little confidence he had left in justice and humanity, that both in Luskan and in Auckney he had been convicted of crimes for which he was innocent. It made no sense to him. If they wanted to kill him so badly, why not just do it for those crimes he had committed? There were plenty of those from which to chose. He caught the last snatches of the guards\u0027 conversation as they walked away down the tunnel. \"A wretched child it\u0027ll be, coming from such loins as that.\" \"It\u0027ll tear Lady Meralda apart, with its da so big!\" That gave Wulfgar pause. He sat in the dark for a long while, his mouth hanging open. Now it began to make a little more sense to him as he put the pieces of the puzzle together. He knew from the guards\u0027 previous conversations that Lord Feringal and Lady Meralda were only recently married, and now she was with child, but not by Lord Feringal. Wulfgar nearly laughed aloud at the absurdity of it all. He had become a convenient excuse for an adulterous noblewoman, a balm against Lord Feringal\u0027s cuckolding. \"What luck,\" he muttered, but he understood that more than bad luck had caused his current predicament. A series of bad choices on his part had landed him here in the dark with the spiders and the stench and the visits of the demon. Yes, he deserved this, he believed. Not for the crimes accused, but for those committed. She couldn\u0027t sleep, couldn\u0027t even begin to close her eyes. Feringal had left her early and returned to his own room, for she had claimed discomfort and begged him to give her a reprieve from his constant amorous advances. It wasn\u0027t that she minded the man\u0027s attention. In fact, her lovemaking with Feringal was certainly pleasant, and were it not for the child and the thought of the poor man in the dungeon, it would go far beyond pleasant. Meralda had come to know that her change of heart concerning Feringal was well founded, that he was a gentle and decent man. She had little trouble looking at Feringal in a I fresh way, recognizing his handsome features and his charm, though that was somewhat buried by his years under the influences of his shrewish sister. Meralda could unearth that charm, she knew, could bring out the best in Feringal and live in bliss with the good man. However, the woman found that she could not tolerate herself. How her foolishness had come back to haunt her in the form of the baby in her womb, in the simmering anger within her husband. Perhaps the most bitter blow of all to Meralda was the forthcoming execution of an innocent man, a man who had saved her from the very crime for which he was to be horribly killed. After Wulfgar had been dragged away, Meralda tried to rationalize the sentence, reminding herself that the man was, indeed, a highwayman, going so far as to tell herself that the barbarian had victimized others, perhaps even raped other women. But those arguments hadn\u0027t held water, for Meralda knew better. Though he had robbed her carriage, she\u0027d gotten a fair glimpse into the man\u0027s character. Her lie had caused this. Her lie would bring the brutal execution to a man undeserving. Meralda lay late into the night, thinking herself the most horrible person in all the world. She hardly realized that she was moving sometime later, padding barefoot along the castle\u0027s cold stone floor with the guiding light of a single candle. She went to Temigast\u0027s room, pausing at the door to hear the reassuring sounds of the old man\u0027s snoring, and in she crept. As the steward, Temigast kept the keys to every door in the castle on a large wrought iron ring. Meralda found the ring on a hook above the steward\u0027s Dresser, and she took it quietly, glancing nervously at Temigast with every little noise. Somehow she got out of the room without, waking the man, then skittered across the audience hall, past the servant\u0027s quarters, and into the kitchen. There she found the trap door leading to the levels below, bolted and barred so strongly that no man, not even a giant, could hope to open it. Unless he had the keys. Meralda fumbled with them, trying each until she had finally thrown every lock and shifted every bar aside. She paused, collecting herself, trying to form a more complete plan. She heard the guards then, laughing in a side room, and paced over to peer inside. They were playing bones. Meralda went to the larder door, a hatch really, that led to the outside wall of the castle. There wasn\u0027t much room among the rocks out there, especially if the tide was in, which it was, but it would have to do. Unlocking it as well, the woman went to the trap door and gently pulled it open. Slipping down to the dirty tunnels, she walked barefoot in the slop, hiking her dressing gown up so that it would carry no revealing stains. Wulfgar awoke to sounds of a key in the lock of his cell door, and a thin, flickering light outside in the corridor. Having lost all track of time in the dark, he thought the morning of his torture had arrived. How surprised he was to find Lady Meralda staring in at him though the bars of his locked cell. \"Can you forgive me?\" she whispered, glancing over her shoulder nervously. Wulfgar just gaped at her. \"I didn\u0027t know he\u0027d come after you,\" the woman explained. \"I thought he\u0027d let it go, and I\u0027d be-\" \"Safe,\" he finished for her. \"You thought that your child would be safe.\" Now it was Meralda\u0027s turn for an incredulous stare. \"Why have you come?\" Wulfgar asked. \"You could\u0027ve killed us,\" she replied. \"Me and Liam on the road, I mean. Or done as they said you done.\" \"As you said I did,\" Wulfgar reminded. \"You could\u0027ve let your friend have his way on the road, could\u0027ve let Liam die,\" Meralda went on. \"I\u0027m owing you this much at least.\" To Wulfgar\u0027s astonishment she turned the key in the lock. \"Up the ladder and to the left, then through the larder,\" she explained. \"The way\u0027s clear.\" She lit another candle and left it for him, then turned and ran off. Wulfgar gave her a lead, not wanting to catch up to her, for he didn\u0027t want her implicated if he were caught. Outside his cell, he pulled a metal sconce from the wall and used it to batter the lock as quietly as he could to make it look as though he had broken out of his own accord. Then he moved down the corridors to the ladder and up into the kitchen. He, too, heard the guards arguing and rolling bones in a nearby room, so he couldn\u0027t similarly destroy the locks and bars up here. He re-locked and barred the trap door. Let them think he\u0027d found some magical assistance. Going straight through the larder, as Meralda had bade him, Wulfgar squeezed through the small door, a tight fit indeed, and found a precarious perch on wet rocks outside at the base of the castle. The stones were worn and smooth. Wulfgar couldn\u0027t hope to scale it, nor was there any apparent way around the corner, for the tide was crashing in. Wulfgar leaped into the cold water. Hiding in the kitchen, Meralda nodded as Wulfgar heightened her ruse by securing the trap door. She similarly locked the larder, washed all signs of her subterranean adventure from her feet, and padded quietly back to return the keys to Steward Temigast\u0027s room without further incident. Meralda was back in her bed soon after, the terrible demons of guilt-some of them, at least-banished at last. The breeze off the water was chill, but Morik was still sweating under the heavy folds of his latest disguise as an old washerwoman. He stood behind a stone wall near the entrance to the short bridge leading to Castle Auck. \"Why did they put the thing on an island?\" the rogue muttered disgustedly, but of course, his own current troubles answered the question. A lone guard leaned on the wall above the huge castle gate. The man was very likely half asleep, but Morik could see no way to get near to him. The bridge was well lit, torches burning all the night long from what he had heard, and it offered no cover whatsoever. He would have to swim to the castle. Morik looked at the dark waters doubtfully. He wouldn\u0027t have much of a disguise left after crossing through that, if he even made it. Morik wasn\u0027t a strong swimmer and didn\u0027t know the sea or what monsters might lurk beneath the dark waves. Morik realized then and there that his time with Wulfgar was at its end. He would go to the place of torture in the morning, he decided, but probably only to say farewell, for it was unlikely he could rescue the man there without jeopardizing himself. No, he decided, he wouldn\u0027t even attend. \"What good might it bring?\" he muttered. It could even bring disaster for Morik if the wizard who had caught Wulfgar was there and recognized him. \"Better that I remember Wulfgar from our times of freedom. \"Farewell, my big friend,\" Morik said aloud sadly. \"I go now back to Luskan-\" Morik paused as the water churned at the base of the wall. A large, dark form began crawling from the surf. The rogue\u0027s hand went to his sword. \"Morik?\" Wulfgar asked, his teeth chattering from the icy water. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I could ask the same of you!\" the rogue cried, delighted and astounded all at once. \"I, of course, came to rescue you,\" the cocky rogue added, bending to take Wulfgar\u0027s arm and help pull the man up beside him. \"This will require a lot of explaining, but come, let us be fast on our way.\" Wulfgar wasn\u0027t about to argue. \"I shall have every guard in this place executed!\" Lord Feringal fumed when he learned of the escape the next morning, the morning he was planning to exact his revenge upon the barbarian. The guard shrank back, fearing Lord Feringal would attack him then and there, and indeed, it seemed as if the young man would charge him from his chair. Meralda grabbed him by the arm, settling him. \"Calm, my lord,\" she said. \"Calm?\" Lord Feringal balked. \"Who failed me?\" he yelled at the guard. \"Who shall pay in Wulfgar\u0027s stead?\" \"None,\" Meralda answered before the stammering guard could begin to reply. Feringal looked at her incredulously. \"Anyone you harm will be because of me,\" the woman explained. \"I\u0027ll have no blood on my hands. You\u0027d only be making things worse.\" The young lord calmed somewhat and sat back, staring at his wife, at the woman he wanted, above all else, to protect. After a moment\u0027s thought, a moment of looking into that beautiful, innocent face, Feringal nodded his agreement. \"Search all the lands,\" he instructed the guard, \"and the castle again from dungeon to parapet. Return him to me alive.\" Beads of sweat on his forehead, the guard bowed and ran out of the room. \"Fear not, my love,\" Lord Feringal said to Meralda. \"I shall recall the wizard and begin the search anew. The barbarian shall not escape.\" \"Please, my lord,\" Meralda begged. \"Don\u0027t summon the wizard again, or any other.\" That raised a few eyebrows, including Priscilla\u0027s and Temigast\u0027s. \"I\u0027m wanting it all done,\" she explained. \"It\u0027s done, I say, and on the road behind me. I\u0027m not wanting to look back ever again. Let the man go and die in the mountains, and let us look ahead to our own life, to when you might be siring children of our own.\" Feringal continued to stare, unblinking. Slowly, very slowly, his head nodded, and Meralda relaxed back in her chair. Steward Temigast watched it all with growing certainty. He knew, without doubt, that Meralda was the one who had freed the barbarian. The wise old man, suspicious since seeing the woman\u0027s reaction when Wulfgar had first been dragged before her, had little trouble in understanding why. He resolved to say nothing, for it was not his place to inflict unnecessary pain on his lord. In any event, the child would be put out of the way and in no line of ascension. But Temigast was far from easy with it all, especially after he looked at Priscilla and saw her wearing an expression that might have been his own. She was always suspicious, that one, and Temigast feared she was harboring his same doubts about the child\u0027s heritage. Though Temigast felt it not his place to inflict unnecessary pain, Priscilla Auck seemed to revel in just that sort of thing. The road to which Meralda had referred was far from clear in either direction.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-24.html","bookId":2132,"book":{"id":2132,"title":"The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2)","description":"Storyline: The Spine of the World (Paths of Darkness #2) Spending time in the unimaginable torture chambers of the Abyss for even a day would be enough to break even the heartiest soul, and the barbarian Wulfgar was there for years.
