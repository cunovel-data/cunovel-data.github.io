He was trying to pay attention to the client seated across the desk from him, but he was having trouble. The client was a nerd named Diehl who ran some biotech company. The guy talked abstractly, no emotion, practically no expression on his face, even though he was telling how his wife was screwing around on him. Diehl must have been a terrible husband. But Barry wasn\u0027t sure how much money there was in this case. It seemed the wife had all the money.\\n\\n Diehl droned on. How his first suspicions arose when he called her from Las Vegas. How he discovered the charge slips for the hotel that she went to every Wednesday. How he waited in the lobby and caught her checking in with a local tennis pro. Same old California story. Barry had heard it a hundred times. Didn\u0027t these people know they were walking cliches? Outraged husband catches wife with the tennis pro. They wouldn\u0027t even use that one onDesperate Housewives.\\n\\n Barry gave up trying to listen. He had too much on his mind this morning. He had lost the Kirkorivich case, and it was all over town. Just because DNA tests had shown that it wasn\u0027t the billionaire\u0027s baby. And then the court wouldn\u0027t award him his fees, even though he had cut them to a measly $1.4 mil. The judge gave him a quarter of that. Every damn lawyer in town was gloating, because they all had it in for Barry Sindler. He had heard thatL.A. Magazine was doing a big story on the case, sure to be unfavorable to Barry. Not that he gave a crap about that. The truth was, the more he got portrayed as an unprincipled, ruthless prick, the more clients flocked to him. Because when it came to a divorce, people wanted a ruthless prick. They lined up for one. And Barry Sindler was without a doubt the most ruthless, unscrupulous, publicity-hungry, self-aggrandizing, stop-at-nothing son-of-a-bitch divorce lawyer in Southern California. And proud of it!\\n\\n No, Barry didn\u0027t worry about any of those things. He didn\u0027t even worry about the house he was building in Montana for Denise and her two rotten kids. He didn\u0027t worry about the renovations on their house in Holmby Hills, even though the kitchen alone was costing $500K, and Denise kept changing the plans. Denise was a serial renovator. It was a disease.\\n\\n No, no, no. Barry Sindler worried about just one thing - the lease. He had one whole floor in an office building on Wilshire and Doheny, twenty-three attorneys in his office, none of them worth a shit, but seeing all of them at their desks impressed the clients. And they could do the minor stuff, like take depositions and file delaying motions - stuff Barry didn\u0027t want to be bothered with. Barry knew that litigation was a war of attrition, especially in custody cases. The goal was to run the costs as high as you could and stretch the proceedings out as long as you could, because that way Barry earned the largest possible fees, and the spouse eventually got tired of the endless delays, the new filings, and of course the spiraling costs. Even the richest of them eventually got tired.\\n\\n By and large, husbands were sensible. They wanted to get on with their lives, buy a new house, move in with the new girlfriend, get a nice blow job. They wanted custody issues settled. But the wives usually wanted revenge - so Barry kept things from being settled, year after year, until the husbands caved. Millionaires, billionaires, celebrity assholes - it didn\u0027t matter. They all caved in the end. People said it wasn\u0027t a good strategy for the kids. Well, screw the kids. If the clients cared anything about the kids, they wouldn\u0027t get divorced in the first place. They\u0027d stay married and miserable like everybody else, because -\\n\\n The nerd had said something that jogged him back to attention.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Barry Sindler said. \"Run that by me again, Mr. Diehl. What did you just say?\"\\n\\n \"I said, \u0027I want my wife tested.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"I can assure you, these proceedings will test her to the limit. And of course we\u0027ll put a detective on her, see how much she drinks, whether she does drugs, stays out all night, has lesbian affairs, all that. Standard procedure.\"\\n\\n \"No, no,\" Diehl said. \"I want her tested genetically.\"\\n\\n \"For what?\"\\n\\n \"For everything,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Ah,\" Barry said, nodding wisely. What the hell was the guy talking about? Genetic testing? In a custody case? He glanced down at the papers in front of him, and the business card.RICHARD \"RICK\" DIEHL, PH.D. Barry frowned unhappily. Only assholes put a nickname on the card. The card said he was CEO of BioGen Research Inc., some company out in Westview Village.\\n\\n \"For example,\" Diehl said, \"I\u0027ll bet my wife has a genetic predisposition to bipolar illness. She certainly acts erratic. She might have the Alzheimer\u0027s gene. If she does, psychological tests could show early signs of Alzheimer\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Good, very good.\" Barry Sindler was nodding vigorously now. This was making him happy. Fresh, new disputed areas. Sindler loved disputed areas. Administer the psychological test. Did the test show early Alzheimer\u0027s or not? Who the fuck could say for sure? Wonderful, wonderful - whatever the test results, they would be disputed. More days in court, more expert witnesses to interview, battles of the doctorates, dragging on for days. Days in court were especially lucrative.\\n\\n And best of all, Barry realized that this genetic testing could become standard procedure for all custody cases. Sindler was breaking new ground here. He\u0027d get publicity for this! He leaned forward eagerly. \"Go on, Mr. Diehl...\"\\n\\n \"Test her for the diabetes gene, breast cancer from theBRCA genes, and all the rest. And,\" Diehl continued, \"my wife might also have the gene for Huntington\u0027s disease, which causes fatal nerve degeneration. Her grandfather had Huntington\u0027s, so it\u0027s in her family. Both her parents are still young, and the disease only shows up when you\u0027re older. So my wife could be carrying the gene and that would mean a death sentence from Huntington\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Umm, yes,\" Barry Sindler said, nodding. \"That could render her unfit to be the primary caregiver to the children.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m surprised she hasn\u0027t been tested already.\"\\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t want to know,\" Diehl said. \"There\u0027s a fifty-fifty chance she may have the gene. If she does, she\u0027ll eventually develop the disease and die writhing in dementia. But she\u0027s twenty-eight. The disease might not appear for another twenty years. So if she knew about it now...it could ruin the rest of her life.\"\\n\\n \"But it could also relieve her, if she didn\u0027t have the gene.\"\\n\\n \"Too big a risk. She won\u0027t test.\"\\n\\n \"Any other tests you can think of?\"\\n\\n \"Hell yes,\" Diehl said. \"That\u0027s just the beginning. I want her tested with all the current panels. There are twelve hundred gene tests now.\"\\n\\n Twelve hundred! Sindler licked his lips at the prospect. Excellent! Why had he never heard of this before? He cleared his throat. \"But you realize that if you do this, she will demand you be tested, as well.\"\\n\\n \"No problem,\" Diehl said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve already been tested?\"\\n\\n \"No. I just know how to fake the lab results.\"\\n\\n Barry Sindler sat back in his chair.\\n\\n Perfect.\\n\\n CHapter 004\\n\\n Beneath thehigh canopy of trees, the jungle floor was dark and silent. No breeze stirred the giant ferns at shoulder height. Hagar wiped sweat from his forehead, glanced back at the others, and pushed on. The expedition moved deep into the jungles of central Sumatra. No one spoke, which was the way Hagar liked it.\\n\\n The river was just ahead. A dugout canoe on the near bank, a rope stretched across the river at shoulder height. They crossed in two groups, Hagar standing up in the dugout, pulling them across on the rope, then going back for the others. It was silent except for the cry of a distant hornbill.\\n\\n They continued on the opposite bank. The jungle trail grew narrower, and muddy in spots. The team didn\u0027t like that; they made a lot of noise trying to scramble around the wet patches. Finally, one said, \"How much farther is it?\"\\n\\n It was that kid. The whiny American teenager with spots on his face. He was looking to his mother, a largish matron in a broad straw hat.\\n\\n \"Are we almost there?\" the kid whined.\\n\\n Hagar put his finger to his lips. \"Quiet!\"\\n\\n \"My feet hurt.\"\\n\\n The other tourists were standing around, a cluster of bright-colored clothing. Staring at the kid.\\n\\n \"Look,\" Hagar whispered, \"if you make noise, you won\u0027t see them.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see them anyhow.\" The kid pouted, but he fell into line as the group moved on. Today they were mostly Americans. Hagar didn\u0027t like Americans, but they weren\u0027t the worst. The worst, he had to admit, were the -\\n\\n \"There!\"\\n\\n \"Look there!\"\\n\\n The tourists were pointing ahead, excited, chattering. About fifty yards up the trail and off to the right, a juvenile male orangutan stood upright in the branches that swayed gently with his weight. Magnificent creature, reddish fur, roughly forty pounds, distinctive white streak in the fur above his ear. Hagar had not seen him in weeks.\\n\\n Hagar gestured for the others to be quiet, and moved up the trail. The tourists were close behind him now, stumbling, banging into one another in their excitement.\\n\\n \"Ssssh!\" he hissed.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the big deal?\" one said. \"I thought this was a sanctuary.\"\\n\\n \"Ssssh!\"\\n\\n \"But they\u0027re protected here - \"\\n\\n \"Ssssh!\"\\n\\n Hagar needed it quiet. He reached into his shirt pocket and pressed the Record button. He unclipped his lapel mike and held it in his hand.\\n\\n They were now about thirty yards from the orang. They passed a sign along the trail that saidBUKUT ALAM ORANGUTAN SANCTUARY . This was where orphaned orangs were nursed to health, and reintroduced into the wild. There was a veterinary facility, a research station, a team of researchers.\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s a sanctuary, I don\u0027t understand why - \"\\n\\n \"George, you heard what he said. Be quiet.\"\\n\\n Twenty yards, now.\\n\\n \"Look, another one! Two! There!\"\\n\\n They were pointing off to the left. High in the canopy, a one-year-old, crashing through branches with an older juvenile. Swinging gracefully. Hagar didn\u0027t care. He was focused on the first animal.\\n\\n The white-streaked orang did not move away. Now he was hanging by one hand, swinging in the air, head cocked to one side as he looked at them. The younger animals in the canopy were gone. White-streak stayed where he was, and stared.\\n\\n Ten yards. Hagar held his microphone out in front of him. The tourists were pulling out their cameras. The orang stared directly at Hagar and made an odd sound, like a cough.\"Dwaas.\"\\n\\n Hagar repeated the sound back. \"Dwaas.\"\\n\\n The orang stared at him. The curved lips moved. A sequence of guttural grunts:\"Ooh stomm dwaas, varlaat leanme.\"\\n\\n One of the tourists said, \"Is he making those sounds?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Hagar said.\\n\\n \"Is he...talking?\"\\n\\n \"Apes can\u0027t talk,\" another tourist said. \"Orangs are silent. It says so in the book.\"\\n\\n Several snapped flash pictures of the hanging ape. The juvenile male showed no surprise. But the lips moved:\"Geen lichten dwaas.\"\\n\\n \"Does he have a cold?\" a woman asked nervously. \"Sounds like he\u0027s coughing?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not coughing,\" another voice said.\\n\\n Hagar glanced over his shoulder. A heavyset man at the back, a man who had struggled to keep up, red-faced and puffing, now held a tape recorder in his hand, pointing it toward the orang. He had a determined look on his face. He said to Hagar, \"Is this some kind of trick you play?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Hagar said.\\n\\n The man pointed to the orang. \"That\u0027s Dutch,\" he said. \"Sumatra used to be a Dutch colony. That\u0027s Dutch.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t know,\" Hagar said.\\n\\n \"I would. The animal said, \u0027Stupid, leave me alone.\u0027 And then it said, \u0027No lights.\u0027 When the camera flashes went off.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what those sounds were,\" Hagar said.\\n\\n \"But you were recording them.\"\\n\\n \"Just out of curiosity - \"\\n\\n \"You had your microphone out long before the sounds began. You knew that animal would speak.\"\\n\\n \"Orangs can\u0027t speak,\" Hagar said.\\n\\n \"That one can.\"\\n\\n They all stared at the orangutan, still swinging from one arm. It scratched itself with the free arm. It was silent.\\n\\n The heavyset man said loudly,\"Geen lichten.\"\\n\\n The ape just stared, blinked slowly.\\n\\n \"Geen lichten!\"\\n\\n The orang gave no sign of comprehension. After a moment, he swung to a nearby branch, and began to climb into the air, moving easily, arm on arm.\\n\\n \"Geen lichten!\"\\n\\n The ape kept climbing. The woman in the big straw hat said, \"I think it was just coughing or something.\"\\n\\n \"Hey,\" the heavyset man yelled.\"M\u0027sieu! Comment ?a va?\"\\n\\n The ape continued up through the branches, swinging in an easy rhythm with its long arms. It did not look down.\\n\\n \"I thought maybe it speaks French,\" the man said. He shrugged. \"Guess not.\"\\n\\n A light rain began to drip from the canopy. The other tourists put their cameras away. One shrugged on a light, transparent raincoat. Hagar wiped the sweat from his forehead. Up ahead, three young orangs were scampering around a tray of papayas on the ground. The tourists turned their attention to them.\\n\\n From high in the canopy came a growling sound:\"Esp��ce de con.\" The phrase came to them clearly, surprisingly distinct in the still air.\\n\\n The heavyset man spun around.\"What?\"\\n\\n Everyone turned to look upward.\\n\\n \"That was a swear word,\" the teenager said. \"In French. I know it was a swear word. In French.\"\\n\\n \"Hush,\" his mother said.\\n\\n The group stared up at the canopy, searching the dense mass of dark leaves. They could not see the ape up there.\\n\\n The heavyset man yelled,\"Qu\u0027est-ce que tu dis?\"\\n\\n There was no answer. Just the crash of an animal moving through branches, and the distant cry of a hornbill.\\n\\n CHEEKY CHIMP CHEWS OFF TOURISTS\\n\\n (News of the World)\\n\\n AFFE SPRICHT IM DSCHUNGEL, FL��CHE GEORGE BUSH\\n\\n (Der Spiegel)\\n\\n ORANG PARLE FRAN?AIS?!!\\n\\n (Paris Match,beneath a picture of Jacques Derrida)\\n\\n MUSLIM MONKEY BERATES WESTERNERS\\n\\n (Weekly Standard)\\n\\n MONKEY MOUTHS OFF, WITNESSES AGAPE\\n\\n (National Enquirer)\\n\\n TALKING CHIMPANZEE REPORTED IN JAVA\\n\\n (New York Times,subsequent correction printed)\\n\\n POLYGLOT PRIMATES SIGHTED IN SUMATRA\\n\\n (Los Angeles Times)\\n\\n \"And, finally, a group of tourists in Indonesia swear they were abused by an orangutan in the jungles of Borneo.

The sound was turned off, but he was reading the crawl beneath. \"It says, \u0027Talking Ape Cited in Sumatra.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"You mean it got a speeding ticket?\" his wife said, glancing at the screen. She was making breakfast.\\n\\n \"No,\" Huggins said. \"They must mean the ape was \u0027sighted.\u0027 With an \u0027s.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"The ape was sighted? Meaning the ape could see?\" His wife was a high school English teacher. She liked these jokes.\\n\\n \"No, honey. The story says...some people in Sumatra encountered an ape in the jungle that talked.\"\\n\\n \"I thought apes can\u0027t talk,\" his wife said.\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s what the story says.\"\\n\\n \"So it has to be a lie.\"\\n\\n \"You think? Uh, now...Britney Spears is not getting divorced. I\u0027m relieved. She may be pregnant again. From the pictures it looks like it. And Posh Spice wore a nice green dress to a gala. And Sting says he can have sex for eight hours without stopping.\"\\n\\n \"Scrambled or over easy?\" his wife said.\\n\\n \"Tantric, apparently.\"\\n\\n \"I mean your eggs.\"\\n\\n \"Scrambled.\"\\n\\n \"Call the kids, will you?\" she said. \"Everything\u0027s almost ready.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" Charlie got up from the table and headed for the stairs. When he got to the living room, the phone rang. It was the lab.\\n\\n In the laboratories of Radial Genomics Inc., in the eucalyptus groves of the University of California at San Diego, Henry Kendall drummed his fingers on the countertop while he waited for Charlie to pick up. The phone rang three times. Where the fuck was he? Finally, Charlie\u0027s voice: \"Hello?\"\\n\\n \"Charlie,\" Henry said. \"Did you hear the news?\"\\n\\n \"What news?\"\\n\\n \"The ape in Sumatra, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n \"That has to be bullshit,\" Charlie said.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Come on, Henry. You know it\u0027s bullshit.\"\\n\\n \"They said the ape spoke Dutch.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s bullshit.\"\\n\\n \"It might have been Uttenbroek\u0027s team,\" Kendall said.\\n\\n \"Nah. The ape was big, two or three years old.\"\\n\\n \"So? Uttenbroek could have done it a few years ago. His team\u0027s advanced enough. Besides, those guys from Utrecht are all liars.\"\\n\\n Charlie Huggins sighed. \"It\u0027s illegal in the Netherlands to do that research.\"\\n\\n \"Right. Which is why they would go to Sumatra to do it.\"\\n\\n \"Henry, the technology\u0027s much too difficult. We\u0027re years away from making a transgenic ape. You know that.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that. You hear what Utrecht announced yesterday? They harvested bull stem cells and cultured them in mouse testicles. I would saythat is difficult. I would say that is fucking cutting edge.\"\\n\\n \"Especially for the bulls.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see anything funny here.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you imagine the poor mice, dragging around giant purple bulls\u0027 balls?\"\\n\\n \"Still not laughing...\"\\n\\n \"Henry,\" Charlie said. \"Are you telling me you see one report on television about a talking ape, and you actually believe it?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid I do.\"\\n\\n \"Henry.\" Charlie sounded exasperated. \"It\u0027s television. This story\u0027s right up there with the two-headed snake. Pull yourself together.\"\\n\\n \"The two-headed snake was real.\"\\n\\n \"I have to get the kids to school. I\u0027ll talk to you later.\" And Charlie hung up.\\n\\n Fucker. His wife always took the kids to school.\\n\\n He\u0027s avoiding me.\\n\\n Henry Kendall walked around the lab, stared out the window, paced some more. He took a deep breath. Of course he knew Charlie was right. It had to be a fake story.\\n\\n But...what if it wasn\u0027t?\\n\\n It was truethat Henry Kendall had a tendency to be high-strung; his hands sometimes shook when he spoke, especially when he was excited. And he was a bit of a klutz, always stumbling, banging into things at the lab. He had a nervous stomach. He was a worrier.\\n\\n But what Henry couldn\u0027t tell Charlie was that the real reason he was worried now had to do with a conversation that had taken place a week ago. It seemed meaningless at the time.\\n\\n Now it took on a more ominous quality.\\n\\n Some ditsy secretary from the National Institutes of Health had called the lab and asked for Dr. Kendall. When he answered the phone, she said, \"Are you Dr. Henry A. Kendall?\"\\n\\n \"Yes...\"\\n\\n \"Is it correct that you came to the NIH on a six-month sabbatical four years ago?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I did.\"\\n\\n \"Was that from May until October?\"\\n\\n \"I think it was. What\u0027s this about?\"\\n\\n \"And did you conduct part of your research at the primate facility in Maryland?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"And is it correct that when you came to the NIH in May of that year, you underwent the usual testing for communicable diseases, because you were going to do primate research?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Henry said. They had done a battery of tests, everything from HIV to hepatitis to flu. They\u0027d drawn a lot of blood. \"May I ask what this is about?\"\\n\\n \"I am just filling out some additional paperwork,\" she said, \"for Dr. Bellarmino.\"\\n\\n Henry felt a chill.\\n\\n Rob Bellarmino was the head of the genetics section of NIH. He hadn\u0027t been there four years before, when Henry was there, but he was in charge of things now. And he was no particular friend of either Henry or Charlie.\\n\\n \"Is there some problem?\" Henry asked. He had the distinct feeling there was.\\n\\n \"No, no,\" she said. \"We\u0027ve just misplaced some of our paperwork, and Dr. Bellarmino is a stickler about records. While you were at the primate facility, did you do any research involving a female chimpanzee named Mary? Her lab number was F-402.\"\\n\\n \"You know, I don\u0027t remember,\" Henry said. \"It\u0027s a long time back. I worked with several chimps. I don\u0027t recall specifically.\"\\n\\n \"She was pregnant during that summer.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, I just don\u0027t remember.\"\\n\\n \"That was the summer we had an outbreak of encephalitis, and they had to quarantine most of the chimps. Is that right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I remember the quarantine. They sent chimps all around the country to different facilities.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Dr. Kendall. Oh - while I have you on the phone, can I verify your address? We have 348 Marbury Madison Drive, La Jolla?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it is.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks for your time, Dr. Kendall.\"\\n\\n That wasthe entire conversation. All Henry really thought, at the time, was that Bellarmino was a tricky son of a bitch; you never knew what he was up to.\\n\\n But now...with this primate in Sumatra...\\n\\n Henry shook his head.\\n\\n Charlie Huggins could argue all he wanted, but it was a fact that scientists had already made a transgenic monkey. They\u0027d done it years ago. There were all kinds of transgenic mammals these days - dogs, cats, everything. It was not out of the question that the talking orang was a transgenic animal.\\n\\n Henry\u0027s work at NIH had been concerned with the genetic basis of autism. He\u0027d gone to the primate facility because he wanted to know which genes accounted for the differences in communication abilities between humans and apes. And he had done some work with chimp embryos. It didn\u0027t lead anywhere. In fact, he had hardly gotten started before the encephalitis outbreak halted his research. He ended up back at Bethesda and working in a lab for the duration of his sabbatical.\\n\\n That was all he knew.\\n\\n At least, all he knew for sure.\\n\\n HUMANS AND CHIMPS INTERBRED UNTIL RECENTLY\\n\\n Species Split Did Not End Sex, Researchers Find a Controversial Result from Genetics\\n\\n Researchers at Harvard and MIT have concluded that the split between humans and chimpanzees occurred more recently than previously thought. Gene investigators had long known that apes and human beings both derived from a common ancestor, who walked the earth some 18 million years ago. Gibbons split off first, 16 million years ago. Orangutans split about 12 million years ago. Gorillas split 10 million years ago. Chimpanzees and human beings were the last to split, about 9 million years ago.\\n\\n However, after decoding the human genome in 2001, geneticists discovered that human beings and chimps differed in only 1.5% of their genes - about 500 genes in all. This was far fewer than expected. By 2003, scientists had begun to catalog precisely which genes differed between the species. It is now clear that many structural proteins, including hemoglobin and cytochrome c proteins, are identical in chimps and humans. Human and chimp blood are identical. If the species split 9 million years ago, why are they still so alike?\\n\\n Harvard geneticists believe humans and chimpanzees continued to interbreed long after the species split. Such interbreeding, or hybridization, puts evolutionary pressure on the X chromosome, causing it to change more rapidly than normal. The researchers found that the newest genes on the human genome appear on the X chromosome.\\n\\n From this, researchers argue that ancestral humans continued to breed with chimps until 5.4 million years ago, when the split became permanent. This new view stands in sharp contrast to the consensus view that once speciation occurs, hybridization is \"a negligible influence.\" But according to Dr. David Reich of Harvard, the fact that hybridization has rarely been seen in other species \"may simply be due to the fact that we have not been looking for it.\"\\n\\n The Harvard researchers caution that interbreeding of humans and chimpanzees is not possible in the present day. They point out that press reports of hybrid \"humanzees\" have invariably proven false. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/next/page-3.html","bookId":1713,"book":{"id":1713,"title":"Next","description":"Storyline: Welcome to our genetic world. \\n Fast, furious, and out of control. \\n This is not the world of the future --- it\u0027s the world right now. \\n Is a loved one missing some body parts?
