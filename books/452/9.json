{"id":27701,"no":9,"title":"II THE VOICE IN THE NIGHT","content":"Captain Francis Newcombe, from the dock where he had been making fast a line, surveyed for a moment the deck of the Talofa below. His eyes rested speculatively on Howard Locke, who, with sleeves rolled up and grimy to the elbows, was busy over the yacht\u0027s engine; then his glance passed to Runnells on the forward deck of the little vessel, who was assiduously engaged in making shipshape coils of a number of truant ropes. Captain Francis Newcombe permitted a flicker to cross his lips. It was a new experience for Runnells, this playing at sailorman—and Runnells had earned ungrudging praise from Locke all the way down from New York. Runnells had taken to the job even as a child takes to a new toy. Well, so much the better! Runnells and Locke had hit it off together from the start. Again, so much the better! He lit a cigarette and stared shoreward along the dock. Manwa Island! Well, in the moonlight at least it was a place of astounding beauty, and if its appearance was any criterion of its material worth, it was a— He laughed softly, and languidly exhaled a cloud of cigarette smoke. There was a lure about the place—or was it the moonlight that, stealing with dreamy treachery upon the senses, carried one away to a land of make-believe? That stretch of sand there like a girdle between sea and shore, as fleecy as driven snow; the restless shimmer of the moonbeams on the water like the play of clustered diamonds in a platinum setting; the trees and open spaces etched against myriad stars; the smell of semi-tropical growing things, just pure fragrance that made the nostrils greedy with insatiable desire. He drew his hand suddenly across his eyes. \"What a night!\" he exclaimed aloud. \"It\u0027s like the eyes and the lips of a dream woman; like a goblet of wine of the vintage of the gods! No song of the sirens could compare with this! I\u0027m going ashore, Locke. What do you say?\" Locke looked up with a grunt, as he swabbed his arms with a piece of waste. \"I\u0027m done in with this damned engine!\" he said irritably. \"It\u0027s too late to go ashore. They\u0027ll all be asleep.\" \"I\u0027m not going to ring the doorbell,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe pleasantly. \"I\u0027m simply going to stroll in paradise. You don\u0027t mind, do you?\" \"Go to it!\" said Locke. \"I\u0027m going to bed.\" \"Right!\" said Captain Francis Newcombe. He turned and walked shoreward along the dock. Over his shoulder he saw Runnells pause in the act of coiling rope to stare after him—and again an ironical little flicker crossed his lips. Runnells was no doubt prompted to call out and ask what this midnight excursion was all about, but Runnells in the eyes of Howard Locke was a valet, and Runnells must therefore be dumb. Runnells on occasions knew his place! He nodded in a sort of self-commendatory fashion to himself, as, reaching the shore, he started forward along a roadway that opened through the trees. He was well satisfied with his decision to bring Runnells along on the trip. \"Captain Francis Newcombe and man\" looked well, sounded well, and was well—since Runnells, for once in his life, even though it was due to no moral regeneration on the part of Runnells, but due entirely to Runnells\u0027 belief that he was on an innocent holiday, could be made exceedingly useful in bolstering up his master\u0027s social standing without bagging any of the game! \"Blessed is he who expects little,\" murmured Captain Francis Newcombe softly to himself, \"for he shall receive—still less!\" He paused abruptly, and stared ahead of him. Curious road, this! Like a great archway of trees! And all moon-flecked underfoot! Where did it lead? To the house probably! This was Manwa Island—the home of the mad millionaire! Queer freak of nature, these Florida Keys—if what he had been able to read up about them was true. Almost a continuous bow of islands, some fruitful, some barren, some big, some small—such a heterogeneous mess!—stretching along off the coast, some near, some far, for two hundred miles. Nothing but rocks on one; tropical fruits and verdure in profusion on another! Well, the mad millionaire, if the night revealed anything, had picked the gem of them all! He walked on again. The road wound tortuously through what appeared to be a glade of great extent. It seemed to beckon, to lure, to intrigue him the farther he went, to promise something around each moon-flecked turning. He laughed aloud softly. Promised what? Where was he going? Why was he here ashore at all? Was it possible that he had no ulterior motive in this stroll, that for once the sheer beauty of anything held him in thrall? Well, even so, it at least afforded him a laugh at himself then. This road, for instance, was like an enchanted pathway, and there was magic in the night. Or was it Polly? Captain Francis Newcombe shook his head. Hardly! Not at this hour! Thanks to the engine trouble that had delayed them, she would long since have given up expecting him to-night, even though he had written her that he would be here. The house, then? A surreptitious inspection; an entry even?—there were half a million dollars there! Again he shook his head. He was not so great a fool as to invite disaster. To-morrow, and for days thereafter, he would be an inmate of the house when he would have opportunities of that nature without number, and without entailing any risk or suspicion—and time was no object. He smiled complacently to himself. Things were shaping up very well—very well indeed. The seed so carefully planted years ago was to bear fruit at last. The greatest coup of his life was just within his grasp; and, if he were not utterly astray, that very coup in itself should prove but the stepping stone to still greater ones. Polly! Yes, quite true! The future depended very materially upon Polly. How amenable would she be to influence?—granting always that the said influence be delicately and tactfully enough applied! He fell to whistling very softly under his breath. He had plans for Polly. And if they matured the future looked very bright—for himself. He wondered what she was like—particularly as to character and disposition. Was she affectionate, romantic—what? A great deal, a very great deal, depended on that. Not in the present instance—Polly had fully served her purpose in so far as a certain half million dollars in cash was concerned, and being innocent of any connivance must remain so—but thereafter. England was an exploited field; it had become dangerous; the net there was drawing in. Oh, yes, he had had all that in mind on the day he had first sent Polly to America, but only in a general way then, while to-day it had become concrete. Locke would make a most admirable \"open sesame\" to the New Land—if Locke married Polly. Polly, as Mrs. Locke, would step at once into a social sphere than which there was no higher—or wealthier—and, ipso facto, Captain Francis Newcombe would do likewise. And given a half million as stake money, Captain Francis Newcombe, if he knew Captain Francis Newcombe at all, would not fail in his opportunities! He had expected Polly in due course to make a place for herself in social America; that was what he had paid money for—but Howard Locke was a piece of luck. Locke conserved time; Locke opened the safety vault of possibilities immediately. He frowned suddenly. Suppose Polly did not prove amenable? Nonsense! Why shouldn\u0027t she—if the man weren\u0027t flung at her head! Locke was the kind of chap a girl ought to like, and all girls were more or less romantic, and the element of romance had just the right spice to it here—the guardian she has not seen in years who is accompanied by a young man, who, from any standpoint, whether of looks, physique, manner or position, would measure up to the most exacting of young ladies\u0027 ideals! And to say nothing of the magic spells that seemed to have their very home in this garden isle—a veritable wooer\u0027s bower! There would be other moonlight nights. Bah! There was nothing to it—save to put a few minor obstacles in the way of the turtle doves! Where the devil did this road lead to? Well, no matter! It was like a tunnel, dreamy black with its walls of leaves, dreamy with its sweet-smelling odours. In itself it was well worth while. It continued to invite him. And he accepted the invitation. His thoughts roved farther afield now. Locke ... the trip down on the fifty-foot Talofa ... not an incident to mar the days—nothing since the night that shot had been fired on shipboard through his cabin window. His face for a moment grew dark—then cleared again. If, as through the hours thereafter when he had sat there in the cabin, it had seemed as though the shot had come from some ghostly visitor out of the past, there was no reason now why it should bother him further; for, granting such a diagnosis as true, Locke and the Talofa had thrown even so acute a stalker as a supernatural spirit off the trail. As a matter of fact, it had probably been some maniacal or drug-crazed idiot running for the moment amuck. To-night, with these soft, whispering airs around him, and serenity and loveliness everywhere in contrast with that night of storm, the incident did not seem so virulent a thing anyway; it seemed to be smoothed over, to be relegated definitely to where it belonged—to the realm of things ended and done with. Certainly, since that night nothing had happened. And yet, now, his lips tightened. It was unfortunate he had not caught the man. He would have liked to have seen the other\u0027s face; to have exchanged memory with memory—and to have slammed forever shut that particular door of the bygone days if by any chance he found he had been careless enough to have left one, in passing, ajar. He swore sharply under his breath; but the next moment shrugged his shoulders. The incident was too immeasurably far removed from Manwa Island to allow it to intrude itself upon him now. Why think of things such as that when the very night itself here with its languor, its beauty, and—yes, again—its magic, sought to bring to the senses the gift of delightful repose and contentment? When the— He stood suddenly still, and in sheer amazement rubbed his eyes. He had come to the end of the tree-arched road, and it seemed as though he gazed now on the imaginative painting of a master genius, daring, bold in its conception, exquisite in its execution. Either that, or there was magic in the night, and he had been transported bodily through enchantment into the very land of the Arabian Nights! A few yards away, he faced what looked in the moonlight like a great marble balustrade, and rising above this, painted into a hue of softest white against the night, towered what might well have been a caliph\u0027s palace. It stretched away in lines unusual in their beauty and design; columns above the balustrade; little domes like minarets against the sky line; quaint latticed windows. And the effect of the whole was that of a mirage on a sea of emerald green; for, sweeping away from the balustrade, wondrous in its colour under the moonlight, was a wide expanse of lawn, level, unbroken until the eye met again the horizon rim beyond in the wall of encircling trees, a wall of inky blackness. He moved forward out on to the lawn—and as suddenly halted again, as there seemed to float into his line of vision from around the corner of the balustrade, like some nymph of the moonlight, the slim, graceful figure of a girl in white, clinging draperies, whose clustering masses of dark hair crowned a face that in the soft light was amazingly beautiful. And he caught his breath as he gazed. And the girl, with a low cry, stood still—and then came running toward him. \"Oh, guardy! Guardy! Guardy!\" she cried. \"I knew you\u0027d come! I knew it!\" It was Polly\u0027s voice. It hadn\u0027t changed. Was the nymph Polly? She was running with both hands outstretched. He caught them in his own as she came up to him, and stared into her face almost unbelievingly. Polly! This wasn\u0027t Polly! Polly\u0027s photographs were of a very pretty girl—this girl was glorious! She stirred the pulses. Damn it, she made the blood leap! She hung back now a little shyly, the colour coming and going in her face. He laughed. He meant it to be a laugh of one entirely in command both of himself and the situation; but it sounded in his ears as a laugh forced, unnatural, a poor effort to cover a suddenly routed composure. \"And is this all the welcome I get?\" he demanded. He drew her closer to him. Gad, why not take his rights? She was worth it! She held up her cheek demurely. \"I—I wasn\u0027t quite sure,\" she said coyly. \"One\u0027s deportment with one\u0027s guardian wasn\u0027t in the school curriculum, you know—guardy!\" \"Then I should have been more particular in my selection of the school,\" he said. It was strange, unaccountable! His voice seemed to rasp. He kissed her—then held her off at arm\u0027s-length. Polly! This bewitching creature was Polly! How the colour came and fled; and something glistened in the great, dark eyes—like the dew glistening in the morning sunlight. \"Oh, guardy!\" she murmured. \"It\u0027s so good to see you!\" \"You waited up for me, Polly?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"Dora was sure you wouldn\u0027t come to-night because it was so late, and on account of it being low tide; but I was equally sure you would.\" \"Of course, I would!\" said Captain Francis Newcombe glibly. \"And I\u0027m here. We\u0027re just in. I was afraid it was hopelessly late; but I didn\u0027t want to disappoint you in case you might still be clinging to what must have seemed a forlorn hope, and so I came ashore on the chance.\" \"Guardy,\" she said delightedly, \"you\u0027re the only guardy in the world! But what happened? You were to have left the mainland to-day, and it\u0027s only five hours across.\" \"You\u0027ll have to ask Locke,\" he smiled. \"That is, as to details—when he\u0027s in a better humour. In a general way, however, the engine broke down. We\u0027ve been since one o\u0027clock this afternoon getting over.\" \"Oh!\" she exclaimed. \"What perfectly wretched luck! And where\u0027s Mr. Locke now? And—no—first, you must tell me about mother. Is she changed any? Is she well, and quite, quite happy? And does she like her home? Is it pretty? And how—\" \"Good heavens, Polly!\" expostulated Captain Francis Newcombe with assumed helplessness. \"What a volley!\" But his mind was at work swiftly, coldly, judicially. To preface his visit with the announcement of Mrs. Wickes\u0027 untimely—or was it timely?—end, would create an atmosphere that would not at all harmonise with his plans. Polly in mourning and retirement! Locke! Impossible! Nor did it suit him to explain that Mrs. Wickes was not her mother. He was not yet sure when that particular piece of information might best be used to advantage. And so Captain Francis Newcombe laughed disengagingly. \"I can\u0027t possibly answer all those questions to-night—we\u0027d be here until daylight. The mother\u0027s quite all right, Polly—quite all right. You can pump me dry to-morrow.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m so glad—and so happy!\" she cried. She clapped her hands together. \"All right, to-morrow! We\u0027ll talk all day long. Well, then, about Mr. Locke—where is he? And how did you come to make such a trip? You know, you just wrote that you were coming down from New York on his yacht. Who is he? Tell me about him.\" Locke! Damn it, the girl was incredibly beautiful—the figure of a young goddess! What hair! Those lips! Fool! What was the matter with him? Polly was only a tool to be used; not to turn his head just because she had proved to be a bit of a feminine wonder. Fool! The downfall of every outstanding figure in his profession had been traceable to a woman. It was a police axiom. It did not apply to Shadow Varne! A girl—bah—the world was full of them! And yet— His hand at his side clenched, while his lips smiled. \"That\u0027s something else for to-morrow,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll meet him then, and\"—what was it he had said to himself a little while ago about slight obstacles in the way of the turtle doves?—\"I hope you\u0027ll like him, though I\u0027ve an idea that perhaps you won\u0027t.\" \"Why won\u0027t I?\" demanded Polly instantly. \"Well, I don\u0027t know—upon my word, I don\u0027t,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe with a quizzical grin. \"He certainly isn\u0027t strikingly handsome; and I\u0027ve an idea he\u0027s anything but a ladies\u0027 man—though not altogether a bad sort in spite of that, you know.\" \"Oh!\" said Polly Wickes, with a little pout that might have meant anything. \"Well, who is he, then—and where did you meet him?\" \"I met him at the club in London, and we chummed up on the way over. It\u0027s quite simple. He was off for a holiday with no choice as to where he went, whereas I wanted to come here—so we came down in his motor cruiser. As to who he is, he\u0027s just young Howard Locke, the son of Howard Locke, senior, the American financier.\" \"Oh!\" said Polly Wickes again. What a ravishing little pout! Where had the girl learned the trick? Was it a trick? Those eyes were wonderfully frank, steady, ingenuous—wonderfully deep and self-reliant. He wondered if he looked old in those eyes? Young Locke! Fool again! Go on, tempt the gods! Ask her if thirty-three fell within her own category of youth, or— \"Don\u0027t make a sound!\" she cautioned suddenly. \"Quick! Here!\" He found himself, obedient to the pressure on his arm, standing back again within the shadows of the tree-arched road. \"What is it, Polly?\" he asked in surprise. \"Look!\" she whispered, and pointed out across the lawn. A figure was emerging from the trees some hundred yards away, and, in the open now, began to approach the house. Captain Francis Newcombe stared. It was a bare-headed, white-haired old man in a dressing gown that reached almost to his heels. The man walked quickly, but with a queer, bird-like movement of his head which he cocked from side to side at almost every step, darting furtive glances in all directions around him. Captain Francis Newcombe felt the girl\u0027s hand tighten in a tense grip on his arm. Rather curious, this! The figure was making for that hedge of bushes that seemed to enclose the verandah from below. And now, reaching the hedge, and pausing for an instant to look around him again in every direction, the man parted the bushes and disappeared under the verandah. \"My word!\" observed Captain Francis Newcombe tersely. \"What\u0027s it about? A thief in the night—or what? I\u0027ll see what the beggar\u0027s up to anyway!\" He took a step forward, but Polly held him back. \"Keep quiet!\" she breathed. \"It\u0027s—it\u0027s only Mr. Marlin.\" Captain Francis Newcombe whistled low under his breath. \"As bad as that, is he?\" Polly nodded her head. \"Yes,\" she said a little miserably. \"I\u0027m afraid so; though it\u0027s the first time I ever saw anything like this.\" \"But what is he doing under the verandah there at this hour?\" demanded Captain Francis Newcombe. Polly shook her head this time. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said; \"but I think there must be some way in and out of the house under there, for I am certain he was in bed less than an hour ago, because when Dora left me she was going to see that her father was all right for the night, and if she hadn\u0027t found him in his room, I am sure she would have been alarmed and would have come back to me. I—I saw him come out of there a little while ago. I was sitting on the verandah waiting for you. I started to follow him across the lawn, and then I thought I had no right to do so, and then I saw you, and—and I forgot all about him.\" Captain Francis Newcombe was a master of facial expression. He became instantly grave and concerned. \"Well, I should say then,\" he stated thoughtfully, \"that, from what I\u0027ve just seen, and from what you wrote in your letter about the fabulous sum of money he keeps about him, he ought to have a good deal of medical attention, and the money taken from him and put in some safe place. Don\u0027t you know Miss Marlin well enough to suggest something like that?\" Polly Wickes shook her head quickly. \"Oh, you don\u0027t understand, guardy!\" she said anxiously. \"He has had medical attention. The very best specialist from New York has been here since I wrote you. And he says there is really absolutely nothing that can be done. Mr. Marlin is just the dearest old man you ever knew. It\u0027s just on that one subject, not so much money as finance, though I don\u0027t quite understand the difference, that he is insane. If he were taken away from here and shut up anywhere it would kill him. And, as Doctor Daemer said, what better place could there be than this? And anyway Dora wouldn\u0027t hear of it. And as for taking the money away from him, nobody knows where it is.\" Captain Francis Newcombe was staring at the bushes that fringed the verandah. \"Oh!\" he said quietly. \"That puts quite a different complexion on the matter. I didn\u0027t understand. I gathered from your letter that the money was more or less always in evidence. In fact, I think you said he showed it to you—a half million dollars in cash.\" \"So he did,\" Polly answered; \"but that\u0027s the only time I ever saw it; and I don\u0027t think even Dora has ever seen it more than once or twice. He has got it hidden somewhere, of course; but as it would be the very worst thing in the world for him to get the idea into his head that any one was watching him in an effort to discover his secret, Dora has been very careful to show no signs of interest in it. Doctor Daemer warned her particularly that any suspicions aroused in her father\u0027s mind would only accentuate the disease. Oh, guardy, it\u0027s a terribly sad case; and insanity is such a horribly strange thing! He never seems to—\" Polly was still talking. Captain Francis Newcombe inclined his head from time to time in assumed interest. He was no longer listening. Polly, the beauty of the night, his immediate surroundings, were, for the moment, extraneous things. His mind was at work. Incredible luck! The problem that had troubled him, that he had never really solved, that he had, indeed, finally decided must be left to circumstances as he should find them here and be then governed thereby, was now solved in a manner that far exceeded anything he could possibly have hoped for. To obtain the actual possession of the money from a fuddle-brained old idiot had never bothered him—that was a very simple matter. But to get away with the money after the robbery had been committed had not appeared so simple. Some one on the island must be guilty. The circle would be none too wide. He must emerge without a breath of suspicion having touched him. Not so simple! There would have been a way, of course; wits and ingenuity would have supplied it—but that had been the really intricate part of the undertaking. And now—incredible luck! He had naturally assumed that the household knew where the old madman kept his money; naturally assumed that there would be a beastly fuss and uproar over its disappearance—but now there would be nothing of the kind. It might take a few days to solve the old fool\u0027s secret, but in the main that would be child\u0027s play; after that, if by any unfortunate chance an accident happened to Mr. Jonathan P. Marlin, the whereabouts of the money would forever remain a mystery—save to one Captain Francis Newcombe. No one could, or would, be accused of having taken it! \"... Guardy, you quite understand, don\u0027t you?\" ended Polly Wickes. Captain Francis Newcombe smiled at the upturned, serious face. \"Quite, Polly! Quite!\" he answered earnestly. \"Very fully, I might say. It must be very hard indeed on Miss Marlin. I am so sorry for her. I wish there were something we might do. Your being here must have been a blessing to her.\" The colour stole into Polly Wickes\u0027 cheeks. \"Guardy, you\u0027re a dear!\" she whispered. \"Am I?\" he said—and took possession of her hand. What a soft, cool little palm it was! What an entrancing little figure! Who would have dreamed that Polly would develop into so lovely—no, not lovely—damn it, she was divine! Polly and a half million! Why Locke? Curse Locke! The eyes and lips of a dream woman, he had said; a half million—both his for the taking! Did he ask still more? He was not so sure about Locke having her. No, it wasn\u0027t the night drugging his senses and steeping his soul in fanciful possession of desires. It was real. If it pleased him, he had only to take, to drink his fill to satiation of this goblet of the gods. There was nothing to stay him. He had builded for it, and he was entitled to it; it wasn\u0027t chance. Chance! There was strange laughter in his heart. Chance was the playground of fools! Why shouldn\u0027t he laugh, aye, and boastingly! Who was to deny him what he would; this woman if he wanted her, the— He stood suddenly like a man dazed and stunned. He let fall the girl\u0027s hand. Was he mad, insane, his mind unbalanced; was reason gone? It had come out of the night, a mocking thing, a voice that jeered and rocked with wild mirth. His eyes met Polly\u0027s. She was frightened, startled; her face had gone a little white. Imagination? As he had imagined that night in his cabin on board ship? A voice of his own creation? No; it came again now, jarring, crashing, jangling through the stillness of the night: \"Shadow Varne! Shadow Varne! Ha, ha! Ha, ha!\" It rose and fell; now almost a scream; now hoarse with wild, untrammelled laughter. \"Shadow Varne! Shadow Varne! Ha, ha! Ha, ha!\" And then like a long, drawn-out eerie call: \"Shad-ow Va-arne!\" And then the soft whispering of the leaves through the trees, and no other sound. \"What is it? What is it?\" Polly cried out. \"What a horrible voice!\" Captain Francis Newcombe\u0027s hand, hidden in his pocket, held a revolver. To get rid of the girl now! The voice had come from the woods in the direction of the shore. A voice! Shadow Varne! Who called Shadow Varne here on this island where Shadow Varne had never been heard of? He was cold as ice now; cold with a merciless fury battering at his heart. He did not know—but he would know! And then— \"You run along into the house, Polly.\" He forced a cool sang-froid into his voice. \"It\u0027s probably nothing more than some of the negroes you spoke of in your letter cat-calling out there on the water; or else some one with a perverted sense of humour in the woods here trying to spoof us—and in that case a lesson is needed. Quick now, Polly! It\u0027s time you were in bed anyway. And say nothing about it—there\u0027s no use raising an alarm over what probably amounts to nothing. I\u0027ll tell you all about it in the morning.\" She was still staring at him in a frightened, startled way. \"But, guardy,\" she faltered, \"you—\" Damn the girl! She was wasting precious moments! But he could not explain that he had a personal interest in that cursed voice, could he? He smiled reassuringly. \"I\u0027ll tell you all about it in the morning—if there\u0027s anything to tell,\" he repeated. \"Now, run along. Good-night, dear!\" \"Good-night, guardy,\" she said hesitatingly. He watched her start toward the house; then he swung quickly from the road into the woods. He swore savagely to himself. She had kept him too long. There was very little chance now of finding the owner of that voice. Had there ever been? What did it matter, the moment or so it had taken to get rid of Polly? The odds were all with the voice, and had been from the start. He was not only metaphorically, but literally, stabbing in the dark. What did it mean? Again he swore, and swore now through clenched teeth. He knew well enough what it meant. It meant what he knew now that shot through his cabin window had meant. It meant that he was known to some one as he should be known to no one. It meant that of two men on this island, there was room for only one; otherwise it promised disaster, exposure—the end. A strangling, horrible end—on the end of a rope. A door of the past ajar! Who? Who? He was making too much noise! Rather than stalking his game, he was more likely to be stalked. He had been stalked—when that voice had cried out. He halted—listened. Nothing! But it was somewhere in here that the voice had come from. He could swear to that. He worked forward again. Damn the trees and foliage! How could one go quietly when one had to fight one\u0027s way through? And it was soggy and wet underfoot—one\u0027s feet made squeaky, oozy noises. He came out on the beach—a long, curving stretch of sand, glistening white in the moonlight. He was amazed that he had travelled so far. How far had he travelled? His mind, like his soul, was in a state of fury, of fear; there was upon him a frenzy, the urge of self-preservation, to kill. A structure of some kind, extending out into the sea, loomed up a distance away over to the right. He stared at it. It was a boathouse; and its ornate, exaggerated size stamped it at once as an adjunct to the mad millionaire\u0027s mansion. But the voice had not come from the boathouse—it had come from the woods back in here behind him. Captain Francis Newcombe retraced his steps into the woods again, but now with far greater caution than before; and presently, his revolver in his hand, he sat down upon the stump of a tree. He held his hand up close before his eyes. It was steady, without sign of tremor. That was better! He was cooler now—no, cool; not cooler—quite himself. If he could not move here in the woods without making a noise, neither could any one else. And from the moment that voice had flung its threat and jeer through the night there had been no sound in the underbrush. He had listened, straining his ears for that very thing, even while he had manoeuvred to get Polly out of the road without arousing suspicion anent himself in her mind. He was listening now. It was the only chance. True, whoever it was might have been close to the beach, or close to the road, and had already escaped, and in that case he was done in; but on the other hand, the man, if it were a man and not a devil, might very well have done what he, Captain Francis Newcombe, was doing now, remained silent and motionless, secure in the darkness. If that were so then, sooner or later, the other must make a move. Silly? Impossible? A preposterous theory? Perhaps! But there was no alternative hope of catching the other to-night. Why hadn\u0027t he adopted this plan from the start? How sure was he after all that, covered by the noise he himself had made, the other had not got away? The minutes passed—five, ten of them. There was no sound. The silence itself became heavy. It began to palpitate. It grew even clamorous, thundering ghastly auguries, threats and gibes in his ears. And then it began to take up a horrible sing-song refrain: \"Who was it? Who was it? Who was it?\" What would to-morrow bring? Shadow Varne! It was literally a death sentence, wasn\u0027t it?—unless he could close forever those bawling lips! He felt the grey come creeping into his face. He, who laughed at fear, who had laughed at it all his life, save through that one night on board the ship, was beginning to fight over again his battle for composure. Shadow Varne! Shadow Varne! Hell itself seemed striving to shake his nerve. Well, neither hell nor anything else could do it! There were those who had learned that to their cost! And, it seemed, there was another now who was yet to learn it! His teeth clamped suddenly together in a vicious snap, and suddenly he was on his feet. Faintly there came the rustle of foliage—it came again. He could not place its direction at first. It might be an animal. No! The rustling ceased. Some one was running now on the road in the direction of the dock—but a long way off. He lunged and tore his way through trees and undergrowth, and broke into the clear of the road. He raced madly along it. He could see nothing ahead because of those infernal moon-flecked turnings that he had been fool enough to rave over on his way to the house. Nothing! He drew up for a second and listened. Nothing! He spurted on again. A game of blindman\u0027s-buff—and he was blindfolded! He came out into the clearing with the dock in sight. Again he stopped and listened. Still nothing! His lips tightened. It was futile. He would only be playing the fool to grope further around in the darkness in what now could be but the most aimless fashion, robbed even of a single possible objective. He could not search the island! There was nothing left to do but go on board. He started out along the dock—and then suddenly, as his eyes narrowed, his stride became nonchalant, debonair. He fell to whistling softly a catchy air from a recent musical comedy. Runnells had not gone to bed. Runnells was stretched out on his back on the deck of the yacht smoking a pipe, his head propped up on a coil of rope. Captain Francis Newcombe dropped lightly from the wharf to the deck. \"Hello, Runnells,\" he observed, as he halted in front of the other, \"the artistry of the night got you, too? Well, I must say, it\u0027s too fine to waste all of it at any rate in sleep.\" \"You\u0027re bloody well right, it is!\" said Runnells. \"Strike me pink, if it ain\u0027t! I\u0027ve heard of these here places from the time I was born, but I wouldn\u0027t have believed it if I hadn\u0027t laid here smoking my pipe and saying to myself, this here\u0027s you, Runnells, and that there\u0027s it. London! I can do without London for a bit!\" \"Quite so!\" said Captain Francis Newcombe. He leaned over and ran his fingers along the sole of Runnells\u0027 upturned boot. Runnells sat up with a jerk. \"What the \u0027ell are you doing?\" he ejaculated. \"Striking a match,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe, as he lighted a cigarette. \"You don\u0027t mind, do you? It saves the deck.\" Runnells, with a grunt, returned his head to the comfort of the coiled rope. \"Locke turned in?\" inquired Captain Francis Newcombe casually. \"About ten minutes after you left,\" said Runnells. \"That engine did him down, if you ask me. I mixed him a peg, and he was off like a shot.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know of anything better to do myself,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe. He turned and walked slowly toward the cabin companionway; but aft by the rail he paused for a moment, and, flinging his cigarette overboard, watched it as it struck the water, and listened as it made a tiny hiss—like a serpent\u0027s hiss. His face for an instant became distorted, then set in hard, deep lines. Who was it? The sole of Runnells\u0027 boot was dry—quite dry. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3299/90253.html","bookId":452,"book":{"id":452,"title":"The Four Stragglers","description":"简介： The crash of guns.
