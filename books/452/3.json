{"id":27695,"no":3,"title":"II AN IRON IN THE FIRE","content":"It was a neighbourhood of alleyways and lanes of ferocious darkness; of ill-lighted, baleful streets, of shadows; and of doorways where no doors existed, black, cavernous and sinister openings to inner chambers of misery, of squalid want, of God-knows-what. It was the following evening, and still early—barely eight o\u0027clock. Captain Francis Newcombe turned the corner of one of these gloomily lighted streets, and drew instantly back to crouch, as an animal crouches before it springs, in the deep shadows of a wretched tenement building. Light footfalls sounded; came nearer. Two forms, skulking, yet moving swiftly, came into sight around the corner. Captain Francis Newcombe sprang. His fist crashed with terrific force to the point of an opposing jaw. A queer grunt—and one of the two men sprawled his length on the pavement and lay quite still. Captain Francis Newcombe\u0027s movements were incredibly swift. His left hand was at the second man\u0027s throat now, and a revolver was shoved into the other\u0027s face. The tableau held for a second. \"A bit of a \u0027cushing\u0027 expedition, was it?\" said the ex-captain of territorials calmly. \"I looked a likely victim, didn\u0027t I? Just the usual bash on the head with a neddy, and then the usual stripping even down to the boots if they were good enough—and mine were good enough, eh? And I might get over that bash on the head, or my skull might be cracked; I might wake up in one of your filthy passageways here, or I might never wake up! What would it matter? It\u0027s done every night. You make your living that way. And who\u0027s to know who did it?\" His grip tightened suddenly on the other\u0027s throat. \"Your kind are better dead,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe, and there was something of horrible callousness in his conversational tones. \"You lack art; you have no single redeeming feature.\" It was as though now he were debating in cold precision with himself. \"Yes, you are much better dead!\" \"Gor\u0027 blimy, guv\u0027nor, let me go,\" half choked, half whined the other. \"We wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to touch you. No fear! Me an\u0027 me mate was just goin\u0027 round to the pub for an \u0027arf-pint—\" \"It would make a noise,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe unemotionally. \"That is the trouble. I should have to clear out of here, and be put to the annoyance of waiting a half hour or so before I could come back and attend to my own affairs. That\u0027s the only reason I haven\u0027t fired this thing off in your face, and I\u0027m not sure that reason\u0027s good enough. But it\u0027s a bit of a fag to argue it out, so—don\u0027t move, you swine, or that\u0027ll settle it quicker still!\" His fingers, from the other\u0027s throat, searched his own waistcoat pocket, and produced a silver coin. \"Heads or tails?\" he inquired casually. \"You call it.\" \"My Gawd, guv\u0027nor,\" whimpered the man, \"yer don\u0027t mean that! Yer wouldn\u0027t shoot a cove down like that, would yer? My Gawd, yer wouldn\u0027t do that!\" \"Heads or tails?\" The ex-captain of territorial\u0027s voice was bored. \"I shan\u0027t ask you again.\" The light was poor. The man\u0027s features, save that they were dirty and unshaven, were almost indistinguishable; but the eyes roved everywhere in hunted fear, and he lumped the fingers of one hand together and plucked with them in an unhinged way at his lips. \"I—no!\" gurgled the man. \"My Gawd!\" His words were thick. His fingers, plucking, clogged his lips. \"I carn\u0027t—I—\" The mechanism of the revolver intruded itself—as unemotional as its owner—an unemotional click. The man screamed out. \"No, no—wait, guv\u0027nor! Wait!\" he screamed. \"\u0027Eads! Gawd! \u0027Eads!\" Captain Francis Newcombe examined the coin; the sense of touch, as he rubbed his fingers over it, helping out the bad light. \"Right, you are!\" he said indifferently. \"Heads it is! You\u0027re in luck!\" He tossed the coin on the pavement. \"I\u0027d keep that, if I were you.\" His voice was still level, still bored. \"You haven\u0027t got anything, of course, to do any sniping with, for anything as valuable as that would never remain in the possession of your kind for more than five minutes before you would have pawned it.\" He glanced at the prostrate form of the thug\u0027s companion, who was now beginning to show signs of returning consciousness. \"I fancy you\u0027ll find his jaw\u0027s broken. Better give him a leg up,\" he said, and, turning on his heel, walked on down the street. Captain Francis Newcombe did not look back. He traversed the murky block, turned a corner, turned still another, and presently made his way through an entrance, long since doorless, into the hallway of a tenement house. It was little better than a pit of blackness here, but his movements were without hesitation, as one long and intimately familiar with his surroundings. He mounted a rickety flight of stairs, and, without ceremony, opened the door of a room on the first landing, entered, and closed the door behind him. The room had no light in it. \"Who\u0027s there?\" demanded a weak, querulous, female voice. The visitor made no immediate reply. The place reeked with the odour of salt fish; the air was stale, and an offence that assaulted the nostrils. Captain Francis Newcombe crossed to the window, wrenched at it, and flung it viciously open. A protracted fit of coughing came from a corner behind him. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you never to send for me?\" he snapped out in abrupt menace. \"\u0027Ow, it\u0027s you, is it?\" said the woman\u0027s voice. \"Well, I ain\u0027t never done it afore, \u0027ave I? Not in three years I ain\u0027t.\" \"You\u0027ve done it now; you\u0027ve done it to-night—and that\u0027s once too often!\" returned Captain Francis Newcombe savagely. \"And before I\u0027m through with you, I\u0027ll promise you you\u0027ll never do it again!\" \"No,\" she answered out of the darkness, \"I won\u0027t never do it again, an\u0027 that\u0027s why I done it to-night—\u0027cause I won\u0027t never \u0027ave another chance. The doctor \u0027e says I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to be \u0027ere in the mornin\u0027.\" Captain Francis Newcombe lit a match. It disclosed a tallow dip and a piece of salt fish on a battered chair—and, beyond, the shadowy outline of a bed. He swept the piece of fish to the floor out of his way, lighted the candle, and, leaning forward, held it over the bed. A woman\u0027s face stared back at him in the flickering light; a curiously blotched face, and one that was emaciated until the cheek bones seemed the dominant feature. Her dull, almost glazed, grey eyes blinked painfully in even the candle rays; a dirty woollen wrap was fastened loosely around a scrawny neck, and over this there straggled strands of tangled and unkempt grey hair. \"Well, I fancy the diagnosis isn\u0027t far wrong,\" said the ex-captain of territorials critically. \"I\u0027ve been too good to you—and prosperity\u0027s let you down. For three years you haven\u0027t lifted a finger except to carry a glass of gin to your lips. And now this is the end, is it?\" The woman did not answer. She breathed heavily. The hectic spots on her cheeks burned a little wider. Captain Francis Newcombe set the candle back on the chair, and, with his hands in his pockets, stood looking at her. His face exhibited no emotion. \"I haven\u0027t heard yet why you sent for me,\" he said sharply. \"Polly,\" she said thickly. \"I wanter know wot abaht Polly?\" Captain Francis Newcombe smiled without mirth. \"My dear Mrs. Wickes,\" he said evenly, \"you know all about Polly. I distinctly remember bringing you the letter she enclosed for you in mine ten days ago, because I distinctly remember that after you had read it I watched you tear it up. And as your education is such that you cannot write in return, I also distinctly remember that you gave me messages for her which I was to incorporate in my own reply. Since then I have not heard from Polly.\" The woman raised herself suddenly on her elbow, and, her face contorted, shook her fist. \"My dear Mrs. Wickes!\" she mimicked furiously through a burst of coughing. \"Yer a cool \u0027un, yer are. That\u0027s wot yer says, yer stands there an\u0027 smiles like a bloomin\u0027 hangel, an\u0027 yer says, my dear Mrs. Wickes! Curse yer, I knows more abaht yer than yer thinks for. Three years I\u0027ve watched yer, an\u0027 hif I\u0027ve kept my tongue to meself that don\u0027t say I don\u0027t know wot I knows.\" \"Indeed!\" Captain Francis Newcombe shrugged his shoulders. He smiled slightly. \"Then I should say, if it were true, that it is sometimes dangerous, Mrs. Wickes—to know even a little about some things.\" The woman rocked in the bed, and hugged her thin bosom against a spasm of coughing that came near to strangulation. \"Bah!\" she shouted, when she could get her breath. \"I ain\u0027t afraid of yer any more. Damn yer, I\u0027m dyin\u0027 anyhow! It\u0027s nothin\u0027 to you wiv yer smug smile, except yer glad I\u0027ll be out of the wye—an\u0027—an\u0027, Gawd, it ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to me either. I\u0027m sick, of it all, an\u0027 I\u0027m glad, I am; but afore I goes I wanter know wot abaht Polly. Wot\u0027d yer tyke her awye for three years ago?\" \"For the price of two quid paid weekly to a certain Mrs. Wickes, who is Polly\u0027s mother,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe composedly; \"and with which the said Mrs. Wickes has swum in gin ever since.\" Mrs. Wickes fell back exhausted on her pillow. \"Wot for?\" she whispered in fierce insistence. \"I wanter know wot for?\" \"Well,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe, \"even at fifteen Polly was an amazingly pretty little girl—and she showed amazing promise. I\u0027m wondering how she has developed. Extremely clever youngster! Don\u0027t see, in fact, Mrs. Wickes, where she got it from! Not even the local desecration of the king\u0027s English—in spite of the board schools! Amazing! We couldn\u0027t let a flower like that bloom uncultivated, could we?\" The woman was up in the bed again. \"A gutter brat!\" she cried out. \"An\u0027 you says send \u0027er to school wiv the toffs in America, \u0027cause there wouldn\u0027t be no chance of doin\u0027 that \u0027ere at \u0027ome; an\u0027 I says the toffs don\u0027t tyke \u0027er kind there neither. An\u0027 you says she goes as yer ward, an\u0027 yer can get \u0027er in, only she \u0027as to forget abaht these \u0027ere London slums. An\u0027 she ain\u0027t to write no letters to me except through you, \u0027cause hif any was found down \u0027ere they\u0027d turn their noses up over there an\u0027 give Polly the bounce.\" \"Quite right, Mrs. Wickes!\" said Captain Francis Newcombe imperturbably. \"And for three years Polly has been in one of the most exclusive girls\u0027 seminaries in America—and incidentally I might say I am arranging to go over there shortly for a little visit. If her photographs are to be relied upon, she has more than fulfilled her early promise. A very beautiful young woman, educated, and now, Mrs. Wickes—a lady. She has made a circle of friends among the best and the wealthiest. Why, even now, with the summer holidays coming on, you know, I understand she is to be the guest of a school friend in a millionaire\u0027s home. Think of that, Mrs. Wickes! What more could any woman ask for her daughter? And why should you, for instance, ask more to-night? Why this eleventh hour curiosity? You agreed to it all three years ago, Mrs. Wickes—for two quid a week.\" \"Yes,\" said the woman passionately, \"an\u0027 I\u0027m probably goin\u0027 to \u0027ell for it now! I knowed then yer wasn\u0027t doin\u0027 this for Polly\u0027s sake, an\u0027 in the three years I kept on knowin\u0027 yer more an\u0027 more for the devil you are. But I says to meself that I\u0027m \u0027ere to see Polly don\u0027t come to no harm, but—but I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to be \u0027ere no more, an\u0027 that\u0027s wot I wants to know to-night. An\u0027 I asks yer, wot\u0027s yer game?\" \"Really!\" Captain Francis Newcombe shrugged his shoulders again. \"This isn\u0027t very interesting, Mrs. Wickes. And in any case, I fail to see what you are going to do about it, or what lever you could possibly bring to bear to make me divulge what you are pleased to imagine is some base and ulterior motive in what I have done. It is quite well known among Captain Newcombe\u0027s circle that he is educating a ward in America. It is—er—rather to his credit, is it not?\" \"Gawd curse yer wiv yer smooth tongue!\" said Mrs. Wickes wildly. \"I knows! I knows yer got a game—some dirty game wiv Polly in it. Yer clever, yer are—an\u0027 yer ain\u0027t human. But yer won\u0027t win, an\u0027 all along \u0027o Polly. She won\u0027t do nothin\u0027 that ain\u0027t straight, she won\u0027t. Polly ain\u0027t that kind.\" \"Oh, as to that, and granting my wickedness,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe indifferently, \"I shouldn\u0027t worry. Having you in mind, Mrs. Wickes, I fancy even that would be quite all right—blood always tells, you know.\" \"Blood! Blood\u0027ll tell, will it?\" The woman was rocking in the bed again. She burst into harsh laughter. It brought on another, and even more severe, strangling fit of coughing. \"Blood\u0027ll tell, will it?\" she choked, as she gasped for breath. \"Well, so it will! So it will!\" Captain Francis Newcombe stared at her from narrowed eyes. \"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded sharply. But Mrs. Wickes had fallen back upon her pillow in utter exhaustion. She lay fighting painfully, pitifully now for every breath. \"What do you mean by that?\" repeated Captain Francis Newcombe still more sharply. And then suddenly, as though some strange premonition were at work, all fight gone from her, the woman threw out her arms in a broken gesture of supplication. \"I\u0027m a wicked woman, a bloody wicked \u0027un I\u0027ve been. Gawd forgive me for it!\" she whispered. \"Polly ain\u0027t no blood of mine.\" Captain Francis Newcombe rested his elbows on the back of the chair, and smiled coolly. \"I think,\" he said evenly, \"it\u0027s my turn now to ask what the game is? That\u0027s a bit thick, isn\u0027t it—after three years?\" The hectic spots had faded from the woman\u0027s face, and an ominous greyness was taking their place. She was crying now. \"It\u0027s Gawd\u0027s truth,\" she said. \"I was afraid yer wouldn\u0027t \u0027ave give me the two quid a week hif yer\u0027d known I \u0027adn\u0027t no \u0027old on \u0027er. Polly don\u0027t know. No one knows but me, an\u0027—\" Her voice trailed off through weakness. Captain Francis Newcombe, save that his eyes had narrowed a little more, made no movement. He watched her without comment as she struggled for her breath again. \"I didn\u0027t mean to \u0027ave no fight wiv yer, Gawd knows I didn\u0027t. Gawd knows I didn\u0027t send for yer for that. I only wanted to ask yer wot abaht Polly, an\u0027 to ask yer to be good to \u0027er, an\u0027—an\u0027 tell yer wot I\u0027m tellin\u0027 yer now afore it\u0027s too late. An\u0027—an\u0027—\" She raised herself with a sudden convulsive effort to her elbow. \"Gawd, I—I\u0027m goin\u0027 now.\" With a swift movement Captain Francis Newcombe whipped a flask from his pocket, and held it to the woman\u0027s lips. She swallowed a few drops with difficulty, and lay still. Presently Mrs. Wickes\u0027 lips moved. Captain Francis Newcombe, close beside the bed now, leaned over her. \"A lydy \u0027er mother was, an\u0027 \u0027er father \u0027e was a gentleman born \u0027e was. I—I don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 abaht \u0027em except she was a guverness an\u0027 \u0027e \u0027adn\u0027t much money. Neither of \u0027em \u0027adn\u0027t no family accordin\u0027 to \u0027er, an\u0027 countin\u0027 wot \u0027appened she told the truth, poor soul.\" Again Mrs. Wickes lay silent. Her lips continued to move, but they were soundless. She seemed suddenly to become conscious of this, and motioned weakly for the flask. And again with difficulty she swallowed a few drops. \"Years ago this was.\" Mrs. Wickes forced the words with long pauses between. \"\u0027Ard times came on \u0027em. \u0027E got killed in a haccident. An\u0027 she took sick after Polly came, an\u0027 the money went, an\u0027 she wouldn\u0027t \u0027ave charity, an\u0027 she got down to this, like us \u0027uns \u0027ere, tryin\u0027 to keep body an\u0027 soul together on the bit she \u0027ad left. An\u0027 she died, an\u0027 I took Polly. Two years old Polly was then. There wasn\u0027t no good of tellin\u0027 Polly an\u0027 \u0027ave \u0027er give \u0027erself airs when she \u0027ad to go out an\u0027 do \u0027er bit an\u0027 earn something. An\u0027, wot\u0027s more, if she\u0027d known I wasn\u0027t \u0027er mother she might \u0027ave stopped workin\u0027 for me—an\u0027 I couldn\u0027t \u0027ave made \u0027er, \u0027avin\u0027 lost my hold on \u0027er—an\u0027 I wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to \u0027ave anything like that. Polly Wickes—Polly Wickes—the flower girl. Flowers—posies—pretty posies—that\u0027s where yer saw \u0027er—\" The woman\u0027s voice had thickened; her words, in snatches, were incoherent: \"Polly Wickes—Polly Wickes—Polly Gray—Polly Gray \u0027er name is—Polly Gray. I got the lines an\u0027 the birth paper. I kept \u0027em all these years. \u0027Ere! I got \u0027em \u0027ere.\" \"Where?\" said Captain Francis Newcombe tersely. \"\u0027Ere!\" Mrs. Wickes plucked feebly at the edge of the bed clothing. \"\u0027Ere!\" Captain Francis Newcombe thrust his hand quickly in under the mattress. After a moment\u0027s search he brought out a soiled envelope. It bore a faded superscription in a scrawling hand. He picked up the candle from the chair and read it: \"Polly\u0027s papers which is God\u0027s truth, Mrs. Wickes X her mark.\" He tore the envelope open rather carefully at the end. It contained two papers that were turned a little yellow with age. Yes, it was quite true! His eyes travelled swiftly over the names: \"Harold Morton Gray.... Elizabeth Pauline Forbes. Pauline Gray....\" There was a sudden sound from the bed—like a long, fluttering sigh. Captain Francis Newcombe swung sharply about. The woman\u0027s arm was stretched out toward him; dulled eyes seemed to be striving desperately in their fading vision to search his face. \"Polly!\" Mrs. Wickes whispered. \"For—for for Christ\u0027s sake—be—be good to Polly—be good to—\" The outstretched arm fell to the bed covering—and Mrs. Wickes lay still. Captain Francis Newcombe leaned forward, holding the candle, searching the form on the bed critically with his eyes. After a moment he straightened up. Mrs. Wickes was dead. Captain Francis Newcombe replaced the papers in the envelope, and placed the envelope in his pocket. He set the candle back on the chair, blew it out, and walked across the room to the door. \"Gray, eh?\" said Captain Francis Newcombe under his breath, as he closed the door behind him. \"Polly Gray, eh? Well, it doesn\u0027t matter, does it? It\u0027s just as good an iron in the fire whether it\u0027s—Wickes or Gray!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3299/90247.html","bookId":452,"book":{"id":452,"title":"The Four Stragglers","description":"简介： The crash of guns.
