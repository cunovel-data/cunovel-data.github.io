{"id":27697,"no":5,"title":"IV GOLD PLATE","content":"A motor ran swiftly along a country road. Two men sat in the front seat. \"My friend, Runnells,\" said one of the two quizzically, after a silence that had endured for miles, \"what in hell is the matter with you to-night?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Runnells, who drove the car. \"What the captain was talking about last night, maybe—the things you feel in the air.\" \"Bah!\" said Paul Cremarre composedly. \"If it is only the air! For three years we have found nothing in the air but good fortune.\" \"That\u0027s all right,\" Runnells returned sullenly. \"But just the same that\u0027s the way I feel, and I can\u0027t help it. We\u0027re going to lay low for a spell after to-night, and maybe that\u0027s what\u0027s wrong too—kind of as though we were pushing our luck over the edge by sticking it just one night too many.\" The Frenchman whistled a bar lightly under his breath. \"I should be delighted—delighted,\" he said, \"to leave to-night alone—but not the Earl of Cloverley\u0027s gold plate! Have you forgotten that I told you I had made a promise to our little Père Mouche—to eat rago?t from a gold plate? I have never eaten from a gold plate. It is a dream!\" \"You\u0027re bloody well right, it is!\" said Runnells gruffly. \"And I only hope it ain\u0027t going to be anything worse\u0027n a dream to-night.\" \"It is evident,\" said Paul Cremarre, with a low laugh, \"that, whatever you have eaten from, and whatever you have eaten of, to-night, my Runnells, it has not agreed with you! Is it not so?\" \"Look here!\" said Runnells suddenly. \"If you want to know, I\u0027ll tell you. I know everything\u0027s fixed for to-night, maybe better than it\u0027s ever been fixed before—it ain\u0027t that. It\u0027s last night. It\u0027s damned queer, that bloke from Scotland Yard showing up in our rooms!\" \"Ah!\" murmured Paul Cremarre. \"Yes, my Runnells, I too have thought of that. But you were at home the night before, when Sir Harris Greaves was murdered, you and the captain, were you not? It is nothing, is it? A mere little coincidence—yes? You should know better than I do.\" \"There\u0027s nothing to know,\" said Runnells shortly. \"It\u0027s just the idea of a Scotland Yard man coming to our diggings. Like a warning, somehow, it looks.\" \"Yes,\" said Paul Cremarre. \"Quite so! And the headlights now—hadn\u0027t you better switch them off? And run a little slower, Runnells. It is not far now, if I have made no mistake in my bearings.\" Darkness fell upon the road; the motor slackened its speed. \"You were speaking of the visit from Scotland Yard,\" resumed the Frenchman calmly. \"You were at home, of course, when Captain Newcombe returned from the club the night before last at—what time was it, he said?\" \"Oh, that\u0027s straight enough!\" grunted Runnells. \"He came in about half past eleven, and we were both in bed by twelve. I\u0027ve told you it ain\u0027t that. What would he have to do with sticking an old toff like Sir Harris that never done him any harm?\" \"Nothing,\" said Paul Cremarre. \"I was simply thinking that Sergeant Mullins\u0027 theory reminded me of something that you, too, may perhaps remember.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" inquired Runnells. \"A rifle shot that was fired one night in a thicket when the Boche had us on the run,\" said Paul Cremarre. Runnells swung sharply in his seat. \"Gawd!\" he said hoarsely. \"What d\u0027you want to bring that up for to-night? I—damn it—I can see it out there in the black of the road now!\" The Frenchman remained silent. Runnells spoke again after a moment. \"He\u0027s a rare \u0027un, all right, he is, is the captain,\" he said slowly; \"but it wasn\u0027t him that did in Sir Harris Greaves. I\u0027d take my oath on that. We was both in bed by twelve, as I told you, and he was still sleeping like a babe when I got up in the morning.\" \"And you, Runnells,\" inquired the Frenchman softly, \"you too slept well?\" \"You mean,\" said Runnells quickly, \"that he slipped out again during the night?\" \"Not at all!\" said Paul Cremarre quietly. \"How should I know? I mean nothing, except that Captain Francis Newcombe is a man like no other man in the world; that he is, as I once had the honour to remark—incomparable.\" Runnells grunted over the wheel. \"I shan\u0027t ask him,\" he said tersely. \"Nor I,\" said Paul Cremarre. Again there was silence; then the Frenchman spoke abruptly: \"Slower, Runnells. If I am not mistaken, we are arrived. The lodge gates can\u0027t be more than a quarter of a mile on, and the bit of lane that borders the park ought to be just about here—yes, there it is!\" Runnells stopped the motor; and then, with the engine running softly, backed it for a short distance from the main road down an intensely black, tree-lined lane. \"That\u0027s far enough,\" said Paul Cremarre. \"We can\u0027t take any risk of being heard from the Hall. Now edge her in under the trees.\" \"What for?\" grumbled Runnells. \"It\u0027s so bloody dark, I\u0027d probably smash her. She\u0027s right enough as she is. There\u0027s a fat chance of any one coming along this here lane at two o\u0027clock in the morning, ain\u0027t there?\" \"Runnells,\" said the Frenchman smoothly, \"I quote from the book of Captain Francis Newcombe: \u0027Chance is the playground of fools.\u0027 Edge her in, my Runnells.\" \"Oh, all right!\" said Runnells—and a moment later the lane was empty. Still another moment, and the two men, each carrying two rather large-sized, empty travelling bags, began to make their way silently and cautiously through the thickly wooded park of the estate. It was not easy going in the darkness. Now and then they stumbled. Once or twice Runnells cursed fiercely under his breath; once or twice the Frenchman lost his urbanity and swore softly in his native tongue. Five, ten minutes passed. And now the two reached the farther edge of the wooded park, and halted here, drawn back a little in the shadow of the trees. Before them was a narrow breadth of lawn; and, beyond, a great, rambling, turreted pile lay black even against the darkness, its castellated roof and points making a jagged fringe against the sky line. Runnells appeared suddenly to find vent for his ill humour in a savage chuckle. \"What is it, Runnells?\" demanded the Frenchman. \"I was just thinking that in the five or six years since I was here with Lord Seeton, you know, I ain\u0027t forgotten his nibs the Earl of Cloverley. I\u0027d like to see his face in the morning! He\u0027s a crabbed old bird. My word! He\u0027ll die of apoplexy, he will! And if he don\u0027t, he won\u0027t be so keen on his \u0027ouse parties to visiting nabobs and cabinet ministers. He didn\u0027t send into London and get his gold service out of the bank for us when we were here.\" \"Perhaps,\" said the Frenchman gently, \"he did not know that you were valeting Lord Seeton at the time—or perhaps it was because he did!\" \"Aw, chuck it!\" said Runnells gruffly. He stared at the black, shadowy building for a minute. Then abruptly: \"It\u0027s two o\u0027clock, ain\u0027t it? You looked, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Yes,\" said Paul Cremarre. \"I looked when we left the motor. The time\u0027s right. It was just ten minutes of two.\" \"Well, what the blinking \u0027ell\u0027s the matter now, then?\" complained Runnells. \"The place is as black as a cat. They\u0027re all in bed, aren\u0027t they?\" \"That is not for me to say,\" replied the Frenchman calmly. \"We will wait, Runnells.\" Runnells, with another grunt, sat down on one of the bags, his back against a tree. The Frenchman remained standing, his eyes glued on the great house across the lawn. \"Aye,\" said Runnells after a moment, and chuckled savagely to himself again, \"I\u0027d give a bob or two, I would, to see the old boy in the morning! A fussy, nosey, old fidge-budget, that\u0027s what he is! A-poking of his sharp little nose into everything, and always afraid some \u0027un won\u0027t earn the measly screw he\u0027s paying for work he\u0027d ought to pay twice as much for! It\u0027s no wonder he\u0027s rich!\" \"You seem to have very pleasant recollections of your visit, Runnells,\" said the Frenchman slyly. \"I wonder what he caught you at?\" \"He didn\u0027t catch me!\" said Runnells defiantly. \"Though I\u0027ll say this, that if I\u0027d known then that I was ever coming back now, I\u0027d have kept my eyes peeled, and he\u0027d be going into mourning for more\u0027n his blessed gold plate to-night! He didn\u0027t bother me none, me being Lord Seeton\u0027s man, but at that I saw enough of him so that the talk that went on in the servants\u0027 hall wasn\u0027t in any foreign language that I couldn\u0027t tumble to. My eye!\" said Runnells. \"A rare state he\u0027ll be in!\" The Frenchman said nothing. The minutes dragged along. Runnells too had relapsed into silence. A quarter of an hour passed. Then Runnells commenced to mutter under his breath and move restlessly on his improvised seat; and then, getting up suddenly, he moved close over beside the Frenchman. \"I say!\" whispered Runnells uneasily. \"I don\u0027t like this, I don\u0027t! What d\u0027you suppose is up?\" \"A great deal, I have no doubt, my Runnells,\" said the Frenchman imperturbably. \"More perhaps than you and I could overcome in the same time—if at all.\" \"That\u0027s all right!\" returned Runnells. \"I\u0027m not saying it ain\u0027t, but it\u0027s getting creepy standing here and staring your eyes out. I\u0027m beginning to see the trees moving around and coming at you, and in every bit of breeze the leaves are like a lot of bloody voices whispering in your ears. I wish to Gawd you hadn\u0027t said anything about that night! It gives me the—\" \"Look!\" said the Frenchman suddenly. From an upper window, out of the blackness of the building across the lawn, there showed a faint spot of light that held for a few seconds—and then, in quick succession, a series of little flashes came from the room within. The two men stood motionless, intent, staring at the window. The flashes ceased. The Frenchman reached out and laid his hand on Runnells\u0027 arm. \"No need for a repeat,\" he said quickly. \"You got it, didn\u0027t you?\" \"My word!\" exclaimed Runnells. \"Two guards—butler\u0027s pantry—all clear! Strike me pink!\" The Frenchman laughed purringly under his breath. \"Did I not say he was incomparable? Come on, then, Runnells—quickly now!\" And now it was as though two shadows moved, flitting swiftly across the lawn, and along the edge of the building and around to the rear. And here they crouched before a doorway, and the Frenchman whispered: \"Don\u0027t be delicate about it, Runnells. This isn\u0027t any inside job! Nick it up badly enough so\u0027s a blind man could see where we got in.\" \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m doing,\" said Runnells mechanically. His mind seemed obsessed with other things. \"Two guards!\" he muttered. And again: \"Strike me pink!\" And after a moment, with both door and frame eloquent of the rough surgery that had been practised upon them, the door opened. The two men entered, and closed the door silently behind them. An electric torch stabbed suddenly through the blackness and played for a moment inquisitively over its surroundings. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t changed a bit, as I said when I saw the plan,\" commented Runnells. They went on quickly. But where before there had been a steady play of the electric torch it winked now through the darkness only at intervals. A door opened here and there noiselessly; the footsteps of the men were cautious, wary, almost without sound. And then, as they halted finally, and the torch shot out its ray again, Runnells drew in his breath with a low, catchy, whistling sound. The torch disclosed a narrow serving pantry, and, on the floor at one side, a great metal box or chest—obviously the object of their visit. But Runnells for the moment was apparently not interested in the chest. \"Look at that!\" he breathed hoarsely—and pointed to the farther end of the pantry where a swinging door was ajar, and through which an upturned foot protruded. The Frenchman set his bags down beside the metal chest, moved swiftly forward, pushed the swinging door open, and stepped silently through into what was obviously the dining room. And Runnells, beside him, whispered hoarsely again, but this time with a sort of amazed admiration in his voice. \"Gawd!\" said Runnells. \"Neat, I calls that! Neat! What?\" Two men lay upon the floor, gagged, bound and apparently unconscious. One, from his livery, was a servant in the house; the other was in civilian clothes. Paul Cremarre pointed to the latter. \"The man that came out from London with the box from the bank,\" he observed complacently. He pushed Runnells back through the swinging door into the pantry. \"Well, my Runnells, you were grumbling over a few minutes\u0027 delay, let us see if we can be equally as expeditious and efficient with infinitely less to do.\" He reached the chest and examined it. \"Padlocks, eh? Let me see if I can persuade them!\" He bent over the chest, and from his pocket came a little kit of tools. Runnells stood silently by. There was no sound now save the breathing of the two men, and, as the minutes passed, an occasional faint, metallic rasp and click from Paul Cremarre at work. And then the Frenchman flung back the lid, and straightened up. \"Quick now, Runnells—to work!\" he said briskly. \"Père Mouche is waiting for his rago?t!\" \"My eye!\" said Runnells with enthusiasm, as the electric torch bored into the interior of the box. \"Pipe it! I\u0027ve served with the swells, I have, and Lord Seeton was one of the biggest of \u0027em, but I never saw the likes of this before. Gold plate to eat off of! My eye!\" \"They are very beautiful,\" said the Frenchman judicially; \"but it would be a sacrilege against art to appraise them in haste and in a poor light. Work quickly, Runnells! And do not fill any one of the bags too full. You will find it heavy. The four will hold it all comfortably.\" \"Gawd!\" said Runnells eagerly, as he bent to his task. The men worked swiftly now, without words, transferring the Earl of Cloverley\u0027s priceless service of gold plate to the four travelling bags. The Frenchman, the quicker of the two, completed his task first, and locked his two bags. And then suddenly he touched Runnells on the shoulder. \"Listen!\" he whispered. \"What\u0027s that?\" Faintly, scarcely audible, there came a curiously padded, swishing sound—like slippered feet. It came from the direction, not of the swing door where the two guards lay, but from beyond the door through which Runnells and the Frenchman had entered the pantry. \"It\u0027s some one coming, all right,\" Runnells whispered back. \"But only one,\" said the Frenchman instantly. \"Quick! Finish your job—but don\u0027t make a sound.\" There was a sudden, vicious snarl in his whisper. \"Pull that hat of yours down over your eyes. I\u0027ll answer the door, as you English say!\" He moved back along the pantry with the noiseless tread of a cat, and took up his position against the wall at the edge of the closed door. From his pocket he drew a revolver. It was quite black, quite silent now—save for the approaching footsteps. Perhaps a minute passed. And then the door opened, and a light went on. A grey-whiskered little man in a dressing gown, with bare feet thrust into slippers, stood on the threshold. He cast startled eyes on a crouching figure in the centre of the pantry, the tell-tale travelling bags, the gaping treasure chest, and wrenched a revolver from the pocket of his dressing gown. But the Frenchman, reaching out, struck from the edge of the doorway. The revolver sailed ceilingwards from the other\u0027s hand, and exploded in mid-air. And coincidently the Frenchman struck again—with the butt of his own weapon—and the man went limply to the floor. Runnells came staggering forward under the load of the bags. \"Strike me dead!\" he gasped, \"if it ain\u0027t the nosey old bird himself! Serves him proper—sneaking around to make sure he ain\u0027t paying money for nothing, and hoping he\u0027ll catch \u0027em asleep on sentry-go!\" The Frenchman snatched up two of the bags. \"Quick!\" he said tersely. Captain Francis Newcombe raised his head from his pillow, and propped himself up on his elbow. A door nearby suddenly opened. Other doors were being rapped upon. Voices came. The ex-captain of territorials sprang from his bed, thrust his feet into slippers, threw a bathrobe over his pajamas, opened his door and stepped out into the hall. Some one had already turned on a light. He found himself amongst a group of fellow guests, whose number was being constantly augmented. From other doorways, wary of their extreme dishabille, women\u0027s faces peered out timidly—their voices, less restrained, demanding to know what was the matter, added an hysterical note to the scene. \"A shot was certainly fired somewhere in the house, though I couldn\u0027t place where it came from,\" declared some one. \"I am quite sure of it.\" \"There is no question about it,\" corroborated another. \"It woke me up, and I ran out here into the hall.\" \"The Earl is not in his room!\" announced a third excitedly. \"I\u0027ve just been there.\" \"Ring for the servants!\" screeched an elderly female voice. \"Some one may be killed!\" \"For God\u0027s sake!\" snapped a man gruffly. \"I didn\u0027t hear it myself, but if a shot was fired it\u0027s fairly obvious by now that it wasn\u0027t fired up here! What are you standing around like a pack of sheep for?\" \"That\u0027s what I was wondering,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe softly to himself—and joined the now concerted rush down the stairway. Lights were going on all over the house now, and the men servants began to appear. The rush scurried from one room to another. A cry went up from some one ahead. It turned the rush into the dining room, and there, in their motley garbs, chorusing excited exclamations, the crowd surrounded the two gagged and bound guards. Then some one else shouted from the pantry that the metal chest had been broken open, and that the gold service was gone. There was another rush in that direction. Captain Francis Newcombe accompanied this rush. On the floor lay a revolver. The ex-captain of territorials picked it up. \"Hello!\" he ejaculated. \"It\u0027s rather queer this has been left behind—or perhaps it belongs to one of the two out there in the dining room.\" \"No, sir,\" said one of the servants at his elbow. \"It\u0027s the Earl\u0027s, sir. I\u0027d know it anywhere. And, begging your pardon, sir, it\u0027s a bit strange that he hasn\u0027t been seen since—\" \"Here he is!\" cried a voice from beyond the farther pantry door. \"Here, lend a hand! The Earl\u0027s been hurt.\" Captain Francis Newcombe aiding, the Earl was carried back to the dining room, and restoratives hastily applied. Here, the man in livery, released now, his voice weak and unsteady, was telling his story; his companion was still unconscious. \"... Gawd knows,\" the man was saying. \"We was in the pantry, and Brown there \u0027e thought \u0027e \u0027eard a sound out \u0027ere in the dining room. And \u0027e gets up and pushes the swinging door open and goes through, and a minute later I \u0027ears what I thinks is \u0027im calling me. \u0027\u0027Ere, quick, Johnston!\u0027 \u0027e says. And I goes through the door, and something bashes me over the \u0027ead, and I goes out. What \u0027appened though is as clear as daylight now. Brown goes through the door and gets hit on the \u0027ead, and I goes through the door and gets hit on the \u0027ead. And it wasn\u0027t Brown as called to me, it was the blighter that did us in, and—\" The Earl\u0027s voice broke in suddenly. \"I\u0027m all right, I tell you!\" he insisted weakly. \"There were two of them ... one behind the door knocked the revolver out of my hand as I fired, and smashed me over the head with something ... bags, travelling bags for the plate ... that\u0027s the way they\u0027re carrying it ... I—\" The Earl\u0027s voice trailed off. \"It can\u0027t have been more than five minutes ago then,\" said the man with the gruff voice, \"for they were therefore in the house when the shot was fired. They can\u0027t have got very far carrying that load. Quick now! We\u0027ll search the park.\" \"But they wouldn\u0027t attempt to carry it very far anyway,\" objected some one. \"They\u0027d have a motor, of course.\" \"Exactly!\" retorted the other. \"But not near enough to the house to be heard. Did any one hear a motor after that shot was fired? Of course, not! We may get them before they get their motor. Also, we\u0027ll use a motor too! Any one of the chauffeurs here?\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered a man. \"Good! Any one armed?\" \"I\u0027ve got the Earl\u0027s revolver,\" said Captain Francis Newcombe. \"Well, there\u0027s the gun room,\" said the man who had assumed command. \"And you servants get lanterns and things. Look lively, now! Sharp\u0027s the word!\" And for some reason Captain Francis Newcombe smiled grimly to himself, as he attached his person to the chauffeur, and, accompanied by three other pajama-clad guests, raced from the house. At the garage Captain Francis Newcombe appropriated the front seat beside the chauffeur, his fellow guests scrambled into the tonneau, and a moment later the big car shot around the end of the house and began to sweep down the driveway. The ex-captain of territorials screwed around in his seat for a backward glance as they tore along. Every window in the great, rambling, castle-like edifice appeared to be alight; this caused a filmy, lighted zone without, and through this raced ghostly figures in bathrobes and dressing gowns that were almost instantly swallowed up in the shadows of the trees; and from amongst the trees, dancing in and out, like huge fireflies in their effect, there showed in constantly increasing numbers the glint of lanterns. But now the motor was at the lodge gates, nosing the main road, and the chauffeur pulled up. \"Which way would you say, sir?\" he asked anxiously. \"I\u0027d vote for whichever is the shortest way to London—that\u0027s to the left, isn\u0027t it?\" Captain Francis Newcombe responded promptly. He turned to his fellow guests. \"I don\u0027t know what you think about it?\" \"Yes,\" one of the others answered, \"I\u0027d say that\u0027s the way they\u0027d most likely take.\" \"Very good, sir!\" said the chauffeur. \"Left, it is, and—\" He broke short off. \"There they are!\" he cried excitedly. \"Listen! They\u0027re coming out of that lane there, over to the right!\" He swung the motor sharply into the straight of the main road. \"There they are! See \u0027em!\" he cried again, as the headlights brought the rear of a speeding motor into view. \"The old general back there in the house was right. They didn\u0027t bring their motor any nearer for fear it would be heard. That\u0027s where it has been—up the lane there. But we\u0027ve got \u0027em now! This old girl\u0027ll touch seventy and never turn a hair.\" \"Corking!\" contributed Captain Francis Newcombe enthusiastically. \"You\u0027re sure of the seventy, are you?\" \"Rather!\" exclaimed the chauffeur. \"Look for yourself, sir. We\u0027re overhauling them now like one o\u0027clock.\" The ex-captain of territorials for a moment stared intently along the headlights\u0027 rays to where, gradually, the other motor was coming more and more into focus. \"By Jove, I believe you\u0027re right!\" he agreed heartily—and from the pocket of his dressing gown produced the Earl\u0027s revolver. The motor was lurching now with the speed. A hundred yards intervening between the flying cars diminished to seventy-five—to fifty. Still closer! The men in the tonneau clung to their seats. Twenty-five yards! Captain Francis Newcombe shouted to his companions over the roar and sweep of the wind. \"I\u0027ll take a pot at the beggars, and see if that\u0027ll stop \u0027em!\" he yelled. \"Better chance over the top of the windshield, what?\" Captain Francis Newcombe stood up, swayed with the car, fired twice in quick succession and once after a short pause over the top of the windshield—but the ex-captain of territorials\u0027 mark seemed curiously comprehensive in expanse, for his eyes were at the same time searching the side of the road ahead. And now there showed at the end of the headlight\u0027s path a hedgerow bordering close against the side of the road. Captain Francis Newcombe fired again, but as the car lurched now the ex-captain of territorials seemed momentarily to lose his balance, and with the lurch swayed heavily against the chauffeur\u0027s arm. There was a startled yell from the chauffeur; a vicious swerve—and the big motor leaped at the hedge. Came a crash of splintering glass as Captain Francis Newcombe was pitched head first against the windshield; a rip and rend and tear as the motor bucked and plunged and twisted in its conflict with the thick, heavy hedge; and then a terrific jolt that in its train brought a full stop. And Captain Francis Newcombe, flung back and half out of the car, put his hands to his eyes and brought them away wet from a great gush of blood. \"Carry on! Carry on!\" he cried weakly. \"You\u0027ll never have a better chance to get them.\" \"My God!\" screamed the chauffeur. \"Carry on? We\u0027re a bally wreck!\" \"What beastly luck!\" murmured Captain Francis Newcombe—and lost consciousness.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3299/90249.html","bookId":452,"book":{"id":452,"title":"The Four Stragglers","description":"简介： The crash of guns.
