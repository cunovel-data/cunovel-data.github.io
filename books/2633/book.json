{"id":2633,"title":"The Perfect Christmas","description":"Storyline: WHAT WOULD MAKE YOUR CHRISTMAS PERFECT? \\n For Cassie Beaumont, it\u0027s meeting her perfect match. Cassie, at thirty-three, wants a husband and kids, and so far, nothing\u0027s worked. Not blind dates, not the Internet and certainly not leaving love to chance. \\n What\u0027s left? A professional matchmaker. He\u0027s Simon Dodson, and he\u0027s very choosy about the clients he takes on. Cassie finds Simon a difficult, acerbic know-it-all, and she\u0027s astonished when he accepts her as a client. \\n Claiming he has her perfect mate in mind, Simon assigns her three tasks to complete before she meets him. Three tasks that are all about Christmas: being a charity bell ringer, dressing up as Santa\u0027s elf at a children\u0027s party and preparing a traditional turkey dinner for her neighbors (whom she happens to dislike). Despite a number of comical mishaps, Cassie does it all --- and she\u0027s finally ready to meet her match.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-perfect-christmas.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Christian","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":17,"name":"Christian","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
