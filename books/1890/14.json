Since I wasn’t being paid and had a gag reflex, I decided to take that as my opportunity to teach him a lesson. I pulled away, wiped my mouth and jumped off the bed. I waved back at him, \"Don\u0027t start shit with me, France. You won\u0027t win. I\u0027m not one of your toys.\" I slammed the bathroom door and locked it.\n I heard him scramble off the bed, \"J.D., get the hell out here.\" He pounded on the door, \"What the hell was that?\"\n I smiled, \"That was what you get for messing with me. You started this and then you started talking about Phil.\"\n He pounded on the door, \"Guys can die from that, Jack. Open the door.\"\n I started to laugh, \"No way. Go finish by yourself. I\u0027m taking a shower.\" I started the shower and dropped my bra and underwear to the floor. As I was stepping in, he busted through the door. He looked like a bull in a china shop as he seethed. He looked positively malicious as he grabbed my hand and dragged me into the shower. He slammed my back against the tiles but dropped to his knees.\n Gently, he parted my lips and buried his wooly face between my legs. His warm mouth kissed and sucked as his tongue slid up and down my slit. The beard felt amazing against the delicate flesh there. I cried out as he slid one of his thick fingers up inside of me. The hot water splashed down on us, as my knees weakened. I felt it building inside of me. He must have too. He pumped faster and sucked my clit. I tried to grip the tile but I couldn’t. I was slipping. He wrapped my legs onto his shoulders and pushed them farther apart.\n I mumbled something like, \"Mike, I\u0027m gonna cum.\" But it was a mess with the water, orgasm and awkward positioning.\n \"I know baby, cum for me. Cum on my face.\" He tickled me with his beard and mustache.\n And I did.\n I twitched and came, and when he brought me down into his lap, he sat me on his cock. I eased it inside of myself. Instantly, the orgasm started to come back.\n He knelt back a bit on his heels as I rode him. He cupped my ass, working me on him. His huge hands, gripping my ass and moving me in a circular motion under the spray of the water, was hot.\n Not as hot as the things he whispered into my ears.\n \"I love fucking you, J.D.\" He pushed me back and licked my nipple, sucking it and biting lightly. His beard against my breast tickled. \"You feel so good, baby.\"\n He rocked us back and forth. My feet no longer held me, they wrapped around him, clinging to each other. He lifted and lowered my body on his cock, bouncing me on him. I felt the buildup again. He sucked harder, bit harder. I barely registered as I clenched around his cock; he maintained the momentum for me. I orgasmed again. He bit down hard, making me cry out, not from the pain of it. When I came out of the haze, he laid me on the tiles, lifted my legs and placed my feet on his shoulders. He grabbed my hips and fucked me hard. It was everything I remembered, and yet, so much better. We hadn\u0027t done it since we were twenty-five but it felt the same.\n \"Goddamn, J.D. You love it, don\u0027t you? You love my cock.\"\n I tried to nod. I tried to do anything beyond moan and drool on myself, but that wasn’t possible.\n \"My cock loves you. Goddamn, you have a sweet pussy.\"\n My head started bouncing on the tiles, I barely registered that. He ran his thumb over my clit as he slowed the pace again. I shook my head, \"No. Fuck me.\" I looked up to see the wild look in his eyes and grin on his lips. He lifted me up farther. I pushed with my feet on his shoulders and he pounded me until I screamed again.\n He came into me, exploding. I felt it fill me. He collapsed on me, kissing my shoulders and muttering things I didn’t understand.\n I patted his shoulder, \"France, you have to get off of me. You’re squishing me into the tiles.\" I swear I heard a rib crack. He shook his head and rolled on his back. We both lay there for a minute with the water spraying down on us.\n I glanced at him, aware of the swollen mouth, satisfied look on my face, and blush covering my cheeks. \"That was amazing.\"\n He nodded, \"No one fucks you like I do. You know you want to stay with me.\"\n I laughed, \"That\u0027s not a reason to stay with someone. Almost, but no.\"\n He grabbed my hand and kissed it, \"Jack, you’re mine. You always were.\"\n I had no argument for that.\n We dried and made our way to the bed. He was snuggled around me, like he always did and snoring before I even got comfortable.\n I watched him sleeping, mesmerized by the size of him and the way his lips curled. I wondered if I would ever be able to just be strong like him, for him, and run away from it all.\n Thursday Night\n We got into the elevator after dinner. He dropped to his knees instantly and lifted my skirt. He pulled my underwear to the side and licked me before I realized what was happening. My eyes shot open, \"Again? Not in here.\"\n He ran a finger up and down my slit, \"Why not? You\u0027re wet.\"\n I shook my head, looking around for a surveillance camera. \"It’s because you keep kissing my neck. Stop this.\"\n “You haven’t asked me to kiss your lips so I have to kiss somewhere.” He lowered his face again, brushing his beard against the soft part of my thigh, \"You want me again, Jack. Admit it.\"\n I whimpered a little.\n He dipped a finger inside of my pussy and dragged the moisture up to my clit. His bearded face made its way up between my legs. He dragged his tongue the whole way up to my clit. He sucked and flicked.\n When the elevator got to our floor, he tossed me over his shoulder and carried me to the room. He laid me on the bed and buried his face between my legs again.\n I moaned, pulling at my dress. When I got the buttons open, exposing my breasts, he sat up on his knees and unbuttoned his pants. He dragged them down, bouncing his huge cock between my legs.\n \"You ready for me, Jack? ‘Cause I can\u0027t wait a second longer.\"\n I nodded, pulling at his dress shirt. He pulled it off and bent his face down to my nipple. He sucked as he slowly moved the head of his cock between my legs. He dragged it up and down my slit, getting me ready. I held my breath as he entered me. He moaned into my chest as he made a second plunge, getting all the way in.\n His beard dragged against my nipple as he breathed into the top of my chest.\n \"Fuck me. Jack, you see what you do to me?\" he pumped into me hard once. I cried out, “Please kiss me, Mike.”\n Finally, he put his mouth on mine and pumped hard. My legs were spread as wide as they would go to accommodate his thick body. They bounced in the air as he thrust wildly. He rolled on his back, dragging me with him, no doubt too close to finishing. I slid up his cock as he moved my hips the way he wanted them to. His hands moved to my breasts. I leaned forward so he could suck one and roll the other. I worked his cock, sliding up and down it, making it hit the right spot until I felt it. The buildup hit. I moaned as he felt me climaxing and increased his sucking and flicking. I clenched down on him, riding his cock rapidly as I came.\n Sounds escaped my mouth that I didn’t know I could make. I felt him get into position to roll again. I finished orgasming and he rolled on top of me. He sat up, holding my thighs and pumped hard until he came in a series of groans and ball slapping. He collapsed on me. I couldn\u0027t stop smiling or trying to pull him farther into me.\n We finished and I smiled into the spattering of hair on his chest, “You have a one-track mind, I swear.”\n He shook his head, “No, it’s just you.” We laid there half dressed and panting, until I realized I’d left my purse in the restaurant. “Shit. I have to go downstairs and get my purse.”\n He sighed, “I’ll go.”\n I kissed his cheek, “That’s okay. You go get some water and some snacks and we can watch another movie.”\n He laughed, “So much for a road trip. All we’ve done is stay here and have sex.”\n I laughed and walked to the bathroom.\n By the time I cleaned up, he was already gone. I hurried down and grabbed it from the front desk where it had been turned in. I walked across the foyer, lost in thought and smiles. I think I might have recognized him sitting across from the elevator, but my brain didn’t register Phil being there. I walked past but he got up quickly. He looked rough.\n Fuck him.\n I frowned when I saw him walking to me. My heart was pounding and my stomach was clenched. I just needed to get away from him. All I saw was the cape and the lies. Devastation and foolishness filled me as he shouted, \"Jacqueline, wait.\"\n I pressed the button for the elevator, \"No.\"\n He grabbed my wrist, but I stepped into the elevator, forcing him to come with me.\n Being in the small elevator alone was a bad idea. He stepped towards me, \"Baby, I\u0027m so sorry.\"\n I shook my head indignantly, almost wishing I could curl into a ball but I needed Mike. \"No you\u0027re not. You’re sorry you got caught—in a fucking cape, no less. You aren’t sorry you fucked the hell out of that child on my sheets and bed in my shoes!\" Anger and rage were fueling my hatred.\n He winced, \"I\u0027m getting counseling. I have a sickness. Please, come home.\"\n I looked at him like he had three heads, \"Are you high right now? Because you have to be, to think I would go anywhere with you.\"\n He handed me a bag, \"I replaced your shoes.\"\n I snatched the bag. Fuck him, I loved those shoes. The elevator landed and I stepped off. I walked to the door with him at my heels.\n I slid the key in, stepped inside the room and slammed the door in his face, but he caught it. He stepped in and closed it.\n \"I know I screwed up, but I love you. Please, give me a second chance.\"\n I tossed the shoe bag onto the bed I had slept in with France and crossed my arms, \"I want you gone. I\u0027m going to call security.\"\n \"Your father is here with me.\"\n I felt a sickening twist inside of me. My eyes almost watered because I knew what it meant. “How could you? How could you involve him? Did you tell him what you did?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-14.html","bookId":1890,"book":{"id":1890,"title":"The Long Way Home","description":"Storyline: \n How lucky can one girl get? \n Just ask Jacqueline Croix. \n She has it all. \n The right fiancé, money, looks, and connections. \n But everything comes at a cost. \n Sometimes that cost is looking the other way when the imperfections of your world start to show themselves. \n When something happens she can\u0027t look away from, she ends up drunk in a Chanel dress at a pity party on the beach in SC. \n There on the beach, she finally sees the cost of having everything is too high. \n Luckily, Jacqueline has one thing most girls like her do not, somewhere to run when she leaves it all behind. \n That somewhere happens to be to the open arms of the New York Rangers\u0027 right wing, Mike France. \n He has always been there through thick and thin, waiting for his chance to make her his. \n But how do you go from being best friends to lovers, when you know all the dirty details?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-long-way-home.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:35 PM"}}
