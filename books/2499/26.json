{"id":106338,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"Text of a summons from Idelfonzuz I, known as The Warrior, King of Aragon and Navarre, son-in-law of Adelfonzuz VI, King of Leon and Castile, to Germanno, Comide Ragoczy at Burgoz.\n To the most excellent foreigner, Germanno, the Comide Ragoczy, currently resident at Burgoz, the felicitations of Idelfonzuz called The Warrior, who bids you leave Burgoz and travel to Toledom, for such is my pleasure.\n I have been informed that you have experience with Moors and Jews, that you speak their languages and know something of their ways. Those from Burgoz who know you and have given you high praise have said you have conducted various negotiations with Moorish traders on behalf of Christians, and that neither the Christians nor the Moors have had reason to complain of your dealings. I am also told that you have been in the lands to the east of Egypt, and therefore have seen the heart of the followers of Mohammed; many of the Moors in this land cannot say as much, which surely should earn the respect of those Moors with whom you have contact here.\n Now that Toledom is once again in Christian hands, it behooves me to put all the knowledge I possess to bringing this place to order with as little new disruption as may be managed, for now that this city is mine, I seek to have peace restored here so that I may continue the great work of Adelfonzuz of Leon and Castile, and secure all of the Spanish territory for Christians.\n You may aid me in this effort, and to that end, I ask you to make your skills and knowledge available to me as shortly after your arrival as is practical. I have included the order of safe passage to ensure you are not delayed in your travels. I will authorize you funds to purchase any reasonable supplies for the journey, and give you the right to requisition quarters with any Christian between here and Burgoz. You are to retain soldiers to escort you. You may be relieved of all anxiety that anyone will deny you service, for it is given to my benefit. Should you encounter any opposition to my commands, discover the instigator of that opposition and inform me of the miscreant after you are come.\n When you have arrived in this city, you may select from many fine houses where you may begin a household. As a member of my Court, you will be allowed to choose from any of the houses left empty by the Moors who have fled Toledom; the only cost for you will be the cost of occupancy-the house itself will be my pledge of support to you. I will not require you to have servants accompany you, for that would slow your travels and give you more risks of losses and delays. There are slaves in plenty here, and experienced servants eager for new masters now that the Moors no longer rule there.\n Once you have made yourself a life to your liking, then I will ask that you help me to deal with serving out justice to the people of Toledom, and so that the Moors and Jews do not suffer overmuch, I will designate you to attend to them, and to be certain that their needs are met and they are given every chance to conduct themselves appropriately in a Christian court of judgment. Surely it must not be said of us that we came only to end the upholding of the right.\n I want to give them no occasion to rise against me now that this city is secure. At the same time, I want to be certain that the laws of the city are enforced with all rigor. Let the Moors and Jews show themselves willing to accept Christian rule, and let them give fealty to me, and they will go as honorably as any Christian priest. My soldiers are under order to leave the women of Toledom alone-they will have opportunities aplenty for venting their lusts when we begin the campaign for Zaraguza in the spring. It should ease our occupation of this city if the Jews and Moors know they need not fear for their women.\n My later plans will demand more effort from you; Zaraguza is just the beginning of my plans to see Spain free of Moors from Aragon to Gadiz. The Comide of Barzeluna is willing to aid us in driving the Moors from all of Gotalunya, and the new Comide of Portugal will also lend support to this cause. I will explain all to you upon your arrival here. Suffice it to say that I am not going to rest content until I am certain that I have done all that may be done to secure these lands. Once all of Spain is again in Christian hands, the divisions of the lords may be settled in a mutually satisfactory manner. In this, I have the support of the Comide of Barzeluna, who defends all of Gotalunya from the Moors, as well as other enemies.\n In the name of Santiago, amen. Do not linger upon receiving this, but hasten to obey. You are not my vassal, but you are a nobleman and you live or die at my desire. It is to our mutual benefit that you serve me in this; if you are prompt in your coming, I will uphold my promise and reward you handsomely for it, beyond what I have already pledged to you. Therefore, with the prospect of such favor awaiting you, I look to see you here before the Nativity.\n Idelfonzuz the Warrior\n King of Aragon and Navarre\n By the hand of Fre Jimeno\n Carried by Toedonadoz, Knight\n at Toledom on the 21st day of September in the 1116th year of Christian Salvation\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/come-twilight-saint-germain-13/page-26.html","bookId":2499,"book":{"id":2499,"title":"Come Twilight (Saint-Germain #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Come Twilight (Saint-Germain #13) \n Beginning in the 600s, Spain\u0027s old blood rituals of animal sacrifice were replaced by the new gods of Christianity and Islam, who demanded no less obedience and allegiance.
