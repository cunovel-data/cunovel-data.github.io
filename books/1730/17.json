{"id":68945,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Part 4\n Impact Minus Ten\n 16\n CINTA MELLOY WALKED down the chaotic streets of Depot, dodging the traffic that seemed to be roaring past in every direction at once. There he was again, just up ahead. She ducked around a corner as her man glanced around behind himself. She was fairly sure he had not spotted her. Fairly. The man was suspicious, no doubt of that. But he was also an amateur, and that cut into his effectiveness a lot. Cinta watched as Davlo Lentrall stopped to put another of his ridiculous posters up. Cinta hadn\u0027t even bothered to examine any of them, choosing instead to keep her eye on her man. Besides, she knew, more or less, what they had to say. STOP THE COMET! STOP THE MADNESS! PROTEST NOW! LEAVE THE PLANET ALONE! MASS MEETING TONIGHT!\n Pointless. All of it. Much as she agreed with the sentiments on the posters, she knew damned well it was far too late. The deed was done. Cinta permitted herself no such delusions. She knew the comet was coming. And presumably, so did Lentrall. The populace certainly knew it. The only ones showing up at the meetings were Lentrall, a few whacked-out loners, and a collection of spies and informants-some of them from the SSS, and the others easily identified off the surveillance photos.\n So why was Lentrall bothering? Or was all this nonsense a cover for something else-and if so, what?\n Lentrall looked behind himself again, and Cinta ducked out of sight again, or at least tried to do so. She wasn\u0027t even quite sure why she was following him. She had simply spotted him on the street, and started trailing him.\n Up went another poster. Cinta shook her head and gave it up. She turned around and started back the way she had come. She was tempted to order a formal watch kept on Lentrall, assign the job to less obvious and more skillful watchers than herself. If she wasn\u0027t so badly short-handed, she would have done just that. But there were so damned many others to watch.\n At least the evacuation itself seemed to proceeding in an orderly and sensible fashion. The heavy lifters, the construction crews, the seemingly endless series of auxiliary services-emergency medical, motor pool repair, preimpact cartography, provisions, accommodation and sanitation for all the extra bodies-somehow, incredibly, it all seemed to be dropping into place. Those Dee and Dum units Kresh was nursemaiding clearly knew their stuff.\n But there was plenty else happening-and none of it seemed even remotely promising to Melloy. She had loaned a detachment of SSS personnel to the evacuation effort, as per Tonya Welton\u0027s orders, and Cinta had even flown to Depot to take personal charge of it herself. But none of it was doing any good. The SSS was here, doing its overt job-but they also had a covert agenda. They were supposed to watch the other players in the game-and the others were giving them plenty to watch.\n The CIP had its own security people out, and they were watching the SSS-as they should have been. There was still the Government Tower Plaza fiasco on the books, after all. The Ironheads seemed to be everywhere, out in force, the black uniform visible on every street, in every shop. One of the SSS watch teams had even spotted their old friend Norlan Fiyle, quite openly going into and out of the local Ironhead HQ. And then there were the hordes of New Law robots, frantically conducting their own evacuation out of their undersized offices over on Shipping Street. The SSS had stacks of images of Caliban, the No Law robot, going in and out of there, and a fair collection of shots of Prospero too-though he seemed to come in less often, and stay for shorter periods.\n Maybe every last one of them had nothing but sweetness and light on their minds. Maybe all of them had nothing but thoughts of doing good deeds and building the planet Inferno into the Paradise it had been meant to be. Cinta doubted it, but such a thing was possible.\n But disaster could follow on even the best of intentions. And Cinta Melloy was sure that at least someone in this town had less than the best of intentions.\n SIMCOR BEDDLE SMILED as he looked out the viewport of the aircar. There was a fair-sized crowd there to welcome him to Depot. Indeed, quite a large crowd, considering the small size of Depot and its distance from civilization. Simcor Beddle had spent most of the last three weeks shuttling back and forth between Hades and Depot. But every time he returned to Depot, the crowds were still there.\n Thank Gildern for that, Beddle told himself. Thank Gildern for everything. The man was indispensable.\n But it would be best not to keep the crowd waiting. He would have to hurry in order to get ready. Or, more accurately, for the robots to get him ready.\n The pilot robot completed the standard landing safety crosscheck. An attendant robot released Simcor\u0027s seat restraint system for him while a second helped him to his feet. Simcor got up and moved around behind his seat. He stood in the center of the largest piece of open flat deck in the car while the two attendant robots stripped him out of his rumpled travel coveralls. He stepped into the car\u0027s compact refresher unit, and waited for the first attendant to reach in and activate the system. The water jets came to life around him.\n There was no time for a full-length needle shower, and, indeed, the aircar\u0027s refresher did not include many of the amenities Beddle took for granted in the first place, but one did have to rough it, now and again. Besides, even a few seconds under the refresher\u0027s spray arms proved most reviving. He allowed the hot-air jets to dry him, and then stepped back outside to the main cabin.\n It was the work of a moment for the attendant robots to dress Beddle in the jet-black formal uniform of the Ironheads. Almost before he was aware of it, he was ready, all his decorations gleaming, his boots shined to mirror brightness, his perfectly combed hair under his perfectly placed cap.\n One attendant robot held up a mirror, and Beddle nodded in satisfaction at his own reflection. It was always important to make a good appearance. He gestured for the second robot to open the side hatch of the car. It swung open, and Beddle stepped forward to face the cheering crowd.\n There was Gildern, standing on a low platform, leading the applause. And there were the cameras at the back of the crowd, recording it all, feeding it to every outlet the Ironheads could get their hands on. Beddle smiled, stepped down from the car and crossed to the speaker\u0027s platform, his two attendant robots behind him.\n He nodded his thanks to Gildern, and then turned to the crowd. \"Well,\" he began in a loud, carrying voice. \"Here I am again.\" That drew the good-natured laugh he had intended. He gestured in the vague direction of the sky. \"But on the other hand there\u0027s someone else-or rather something else-on the way. Comet Grieg is going to be here in another ten days. By then we all need to be out of here. All of us in the Ironhead party understand how much all of you here in the Utopia region are being asked to give up. We all know how great the reward for the whole planet will be-but no matter how great that reward for others, it is not right that you people here should be expected to pay the price for it. And we\u0027ll see to it that you do not.\n \"I don\u0027t think Governor Alvar Kresh quite sees things that way. And just by the way, has Kresh paid a call to Utopia yet? Is he going to come here at all, before Utopia isn\u0027t here anymore? He\u0027s promised a certain amount of relocation funding for each of you. Well, that\u0027s all well and good, as far as it goes. But it does not go far enough! We Ironheads are prepared to go a lot further. We\u0027ll see to it that all of you are properly resettled. We\u0027ll see to it that your temporary accommodation is as good as it can be. We\u0027ll see to it that all of your movable property goes with you-and not just the \u0027essential\u0027 property Alvar Kresh has promised you can keep!\"\n And that brought the round of cheers that Beddle had expected. Never mind that keeping half of the promises he had been making would bankrupt the Ironhead party. Never mind that the Ironhead contribution to transport and shelter and all the rest of it was barely measurable. By the time all of that became clear, people would be far too busy putting their lives back together to worry about the details of political promisesand Beddle would have laid in a endless stock of political capital as the man who remembered the ordinary citizen while the government was too busy with its grand projects to bother.\n Beddle waited until just before the cheers would have died out on their own, and then raised his hands for silence. \"But friends, if there\u0027s one thing we all know, it\u0027s that time is short. So while I thank you for coming out, I hope you won\u0027t mind if I keep this brief. We all have work to do. Now let\u0027s all go do it!\"\n That last bit didn\u0027t really have much in the way of meaning, but the crowd cheered anyway. Beddle smiled for the cameras, and waved to the crowd, then let Gildern lead him to a small open-body runcart.\n \"A very nice little speech, sir,\" Gildern said.\n \"Good enough for the purpose at hand,\" Beddle replied evenly. Somehow praise from Gildern threw him off stride. It seemed out of character. \"Let\u0027s get where we\u0027re going, shall we?\"\n \"Yes, sir. There\u0027s some news that might well interest you.\"\n The two men climbed into the back of the runcart and the robot driver started the vehicle up. Beddle looked around with interest as they made their way through the small town. He was surprised to see how slowly they made progress. Traffic was in a hopeless snarl. Depot was as frantically busy as an overturned ant-heap-to use the sort of nature-based imagery that was so suddenly popular these days, now that terraforming was all the rage.\n Simcor Beddle shook his head thoughtfully. It was strange to think of, but five years ago, the image of comparison would have been based on robots in some way. \"Busy as a robot,\" or some such. Times had changed, not only in big ways, but in strange and subtle small ones.\n He and Gildern had plotted endlessly over ways to eliminate the New Law robots and get rid of the Settlers. Ways to get rid of the disturbing influences, so that life could get back to normal, back to the way Spacers were meant to live.\n But in recent days it occurred to Beddle that it might be the small things that would be hardest to change back. Perhaps the Ironheads could rebuild a world that had no Settlers, had no New Law robots, had no robotic labor shortage. But how could they wipe the memory of those things from people\u0027s minds?\n In the old days, the people of Inferno had only known of one way to do things, one way of living life: have the robots do it. That was the answer to everything. And it was an answer that had worked. Now they had been exposed not just to other possibilities, but also to the notion that there were other possibilities, other answers that might work as well. Before a few years ago, no one on this planet had been able even to conceive of another way of living. Now a way of life based solely on robotic labor was merely one option among many. How could that be changed back? Especially when some misguided souls had such poor taste and lack of judgment that they actually preferred doing things for themselves, and enjoyed the company of Settlers?\n Even the revival of interest in the natural world was disruptive. Robots, the service of robots, were supposed to provide a cushion, a cocoon, that kept the outside world at bay-quite literally at times. One could easily live a wholly satisfactory life without ever setting foot outside, if one\u0027s robots did their jobs properly. With even the most basic of comm systems, no one ever needed to travel, even to do business or visit with friends.\n But now people were being exposed to nature-not just the idea of nature, but the fact of it. And some of them-a lot of them-seemed to like it.\n It occurred to Simcor Beddle that he had not been outside, except to get from one place to another, for years. He never went to the outside. Some tiny part of him, some all-but-forgotten, all-but-stifled part of him suddenly longed to get out of the groundcar, longed to get on his own feet, start walking and just keep going, to the horizon and beyond. The wind shifted and brought the cool, sweet scent of some nearby stream to him. Suddenly he wanted to find that stream, slip off his boots and dangle his feet in the water.\n The runcart went over a bump in the road, and Simcor Beddle blinked and came back to himself. Nonsense! Utter nonsense. The very idea of his sitting barefoot by a stream was absolutely absurd. Beddle thrust the strange notions, the bizarre impulses, from his mind. He had not come all this way to indulge in such foolishness.\n But if even a brief ride from a landing pad to a field office was enough to inspire such a reaction in him, then how surprised should he be if others were tempted to look out at the wide world outside? \"Come on,\" Beddle said to the driver robot. \"Let\u0027s get moving. What the devil is taking so long?\"\n \"Too much traffic on the road,\" said Gildern. \"There\u0027s a lot more work to do than you might expect. Lots of transport operations going on in the Utopia region, and Depot\u0027s the focal point for all of it. The evacuation is a huge undertaking. Considering this is supposed to be the undeveloped side of the planet, there\u0027s an awful lot of hardware and household effects and Space knows what to pack up and ship out.\"\n Beddle could see that for himself as he looked around. On every side it was the same story. Robots were disassembling and packing up all sorts of machinery and equipment, taking apart whole buildings, packing ground trucks and aircars and every other kind of vehicle.\n \"You wouldn\u0027t believe the changes in this place in the last month,\" Gildern said. \"You\u0027ve only been in and out quickly, a few times. I\u0027ve been here right along, and watched it all happen. It\u0027s incredible all the work they\u0027ve done.\"\n Beddle could see that. There was as much equipment coming in as going out-or at least, so it seemed. Transporters had to be flown to Depot in pieces and then assembled. They had to build living quarters for human overseers and repair and maintenance centers for the army of robots and the swarm of aircars that had descended on the place. A huge groundcrawler roared past, and Beddle had to lean in close to Gildern and shout into his ear in order to make himself heard. \"What of the other matter?\" he shouted.\n \"In the field office,\" Gildern shouted back. \"Noise isn\u0027t enough cover. There might be lipreaders.\"\n Beddle nodded his agreement. It would not be the first time skilled lipreaders had been used against one side or another in the endless, complicated political skirmishes of the last few years.\n A break opened up in the traffic, and the small open vehicle slowly started to move, gradually gathering speed. They crossed the outskirts of town and moved through the bustling, busy, organized chaos that was downtown Depot.\n A squad of robots moved past, marching quickly, each carrying a crate nearly as large as it was. A technical team was working on a battery of probe launchers, part of the scientific research effort attached to the comet impact. Strange, Beddle thought, to look at such a massive cataclysm as a mere test subject. But there would no doubt be a great deal to learn from the impact. There were plans afoot to deploy any number of flying, orbiting, and buried sensors. Many of them would, of course, be destroyed by the impact-but even the pattern of their destruction would tell the scientists a great deal.\n The runcart went through the center of town and out the other side. It slowed to a halt outside a cheerful-looking portable building, a bright orange hemisphere about ten meters high and twenty across. By the look of it, the building had not so much been erected as unfolded. Beddle looked around, and saw that the whole area was dotted with similar structures in every color of the rainbow. The Ironheads weren\u0027t the only ones who had needed a temporary headquarters in Depot.\n Gildern and Beddle got down out of the runcart and stepped to the door of the building. There was the briefest of pauses while the scanning system confirmed both Gildern and Beddle\u0027s identities. They heard the heavy-duty locking mechanism unlatch, and the robot standing inside the door opened it and let them in.\n Simcor looked toward the scanning device on its stand. It was a sleek, gleaming cube of gun-metal gray, its controls and displays well laid out and well-labeled. An armored cable ran from it to the armored box that held the body of the exterior camera.\n \"A Settler-made device,\" said Beddle, the disapproval clear in his voice.\n \"Yes, sir, it is,\" said Gildern, quite unapologetic. \"I do not trust sentry systems based on robots. There is always the possibility that a person skilled in manipulation of robots will be able to convince the robot that there was a good First Law reason to let that person in.\"\n Beddle glared at his subordinate in annoyance. In other words, Gildern was willing to commit heretical acts in the name of security, and trading with the enemy was not beneath him. There was a great deal Beddle could have said, but this was not the time or place. There were other issues to deal with. He did not speak, but instead followed his chief of security through an inner door and into a bare field office.\n The room was completely undecorated, utterly cheerless. There was nothing personal there. No photocube of a family member, no decoration, nothing that would give the slightest clue to Gildern\u0027s personality. It was the office of someone who was camping here, not someone who lived here.\n Of course, Beddle reflected, Gildern\u0027s office back at Ironhead HQ was no less spartan. A disordered office, a cluttered office, was an insecure office.\n There was nothing in the room at present except a table and two chairs-comfortable-looking ones by most standards, quite spartan by Beddle\u0027s.\n \"I personally performed a bug sweep of this room one hour ago,\" said Gildern. \"We ought to be secure enough here to discuss the other matter.\"\n \"\u0027The other matter,\u0027 \" Beddle repeated. \"If we are all that secure here, I see no reason to waste time with euphemisms. Let us call things by their proper name and discuss the destruction of the New Law robots.\"\n If there was any thing that the Ironheads regarded as dangerous, it was the continued existence of the New Law robots. Robots that did not have the true Three Laws were a far more serious heresy than the use of Settler machinery, or contact with Settlers. Settlers were foreigners, aliens, the enemy. Even if someone like Gildern did deal with them, he knew the dangers, the risks when he did so. But robots were supposed to be the bulwark of the Spacer way of life, the cornerstone of the Ironhead philosophy. If the people of Inferno grew even slightly accustomed to dealing with robots that would not unquestioningly endanger themselves, sacrifice themselves, for the good of a human, if they got used to robots who might debate an order, or follow their own agendas, then, Beddle had no doubt, the rot would have set in. If people could not trust robots absolutely, they would not trust them at all. After all, robots were stronger, faster, harder to injure than humans. Some robots, in many ways, were more intelligent. Without the barrier, the protection, of the Three Laws, people would have good reason to fear robots. At least such were the official reasons for wishing to be rid of the New Law robots, whenever Beddle made a speech on the subject.\n But there was another, more private reason. The New Law robots were, plain and simple, a threat to the Ironheads\u0027 power. The doctrine of more and better robots was endangered so long as anyone ever saw an alternative to it.\n But if there were no New Law robots, there would be no New Law robot problem. Toward that end, Gildern and his people had been searching for Valhalla, the New Law robot city, for quite some time, since long before anyone had ever heard of Comet Grieg. Nothing had ever come of the effort.\n But now-now things were different. And Beddle was eager to find out precisely how different. \"All right,\" he said to Gildern. \"What have you got for me?\"\n \"More pieces of the puzzle, sir. As you know, a direct search for Valhalla has never been possible. The minute anyone tried a search, the New Law robots would simply shut everything down. Besides which, the New Law robots encrypt their long-range hyperwave traffic, and we have not had much luck in reading it. Hyperwave signals are also difficult to track with any precision. But with enough signals, it is possible to do statistical analysis. And there has been enough traffic in recent days to let us do some pretty fair work. And more physical traffic as well. The New Law robots are working as hard and as fast as anyone to evacuate in time. That means more signal traffic, more aircars and land cars and transports and so forth. And they are being less careful. There is less point in concealing a hidden city that is about to be destroyed.\n \"The long and the short of it is that we have had a lot more data to work with, and we have been able to work from a lot closer in than we were in times past. We can get equipment and robots in here, right on top of things.\"\n \"With what result?\" Beddle asked.\n \"The best possible result,\" Gildern replied. \"Absolute confirmation that Valhalla is somewhere inside the primary impact site for the first and largest of the comet fragments. It will be utterly destroyed.\"\n \"But we were virtually certain of that before. And as the New Laws are clearly preparing to evacuate, what good will it do for the comet to destroy them after they have all gone?\"\n \"None whatsoever. But look around yourself. Look at Depot.\"\n \"What about it?\"\n \"Depot is being evacuated as well-and there have never been so many people here. The people here all know this place is going to be wiped out, but there is no danger in being here now. However, in the meantime, there is a great deal of work to be done, so they have pulled in all sorts of people to do it\"\u0027\n \"What are you saying?\"\n \"I\u0027m saying that our sources confirm that New Law robots are vanishing from all the places they usually are. They are buying out their labor contracts, closing up the shops they run in the smaller settlements. We\u0027ve seen a large number of them pass through Depot and estimate that ninety percent of the existing New Law robots are in the vicinity.\"\n \"And so you think they are rushing home to Valhalla to help and salvage what they can. What of it? They will be gone before the comet hits.\"\n \"Quite true. But all we need to do is locate Valhalla before the comet strikes, and destroy it while they are still there. And I believe both goals are more achievable than you would think. I also believe it is highly likely that you can accomplish them both, yourself, personally.\"\n \"How?\" Beddle demanded, a world of eagerness and ambition bound up in that one little word.\n \"As for the first part, the question of locating Valhalla, we are able to track a great deal of the increased air, ground, and hyperwave traffic from here, but our ability to triangulate and backtrack is highly limited. If we had a mobile tracking station, equipped with the proper detection equipment, we would soon be able to sort through all the deliberate false trails and extraneous signals.\"\n \"What do I have to do with a mobile tracking station?\"\n Gildern leaned forward eagerly. \"It\u0027s quite simple. We have installed the proper tracking gear on my long-range aircar. I can provide you with robots trained to operate the system, who know how to coordinate the work with the base station here. In short, we would tell your aircar where to go, your aircar would obtain readings from that position, and then move on to the next location. You are planning to visit several of the small outlying settlements on this trip. That would suit us perfectly. Land one place and give a speech while your robots do a detection sweep, then fly on to the next spot, and the next, and the next. We\u0027d rapidly accumulate enough data to establish a very good fix on Valhalla. With enough data, I expect we ought to be able to get within an error radius of only five or eight kilometers. And that should be quite good enough.\"\n \"Good enough for what?\" Beddle asked.\n Gildern was about to reply when the ground suddenly gave a strange, sharp little shudder and the building rattled and shook hard enough that it seemed close to folding itself back up. The air was suddenly full of dust, seemingly thrown up from out of nowhere. There was a distant rumbling and a muted boom! that seemed to come from somewhere far off.\n Gildern gestured reassuringly. \"There\u0027s no danger,\" he said. \"Notice that none of our robots even bothered to rush in to our rescue. But to answer your question-good enough for one of those. For a burrow bomb-a seismic sounder.\"\n \"A burrow bomb?\"\n \"They\u0027ve set off any number of them around here. The scientists want to understand the underlying geology of this area as thoroughly as possible before the impact, so they can better interpret the results of the impact. The explosions cause seismic shock. The bombs themselves are carefully calibrated. They can burrow themselves deep into the earth and set themselves off at a predetermined time and depth. By measuring the vibrations produced by the explosions from various receiving stations, and seeing how they have been changed, the scientists can determine what sort of strata the vibrations have gone through. It\u0027s an unusually destructive way of doing geology, but it gets the job done fast-and what difference does it make when the comet is going to destroy everything anyway? We are virtually certain that Valhalla is underground. If we set off a burrow bomb close enough to Valhalla, the shock waves should collapse the entire city, killing or trapping everyone inside.\n \"There are four or five researcher agencies setting off these devices. I have taken steps to establish a real seeming, research group myself. Everything is being done in such a frantic hurry, with the comet bearing down, that it was easy to get all the various approvals. Our little operation has already set off three sounders, all duly reported ahead of time and properly recorded and so on. In order to stay legal, there need only be an hour or two\u0027s notice of your explosion. You will not be violating any law at all.\"\n \"How could that be?\"\n \"The New Law robots have no legal standing. Technically, they are abandoned property themselves, and they certainly can\u0027t own property. They have never registered any title to Valhalla-how could they, when no one knows where it is?\"\n Beddle nodded impatiently. The arguments were all familiar to him. \"Yes, yes, you don\u0027t have to convince me of anything. But don\u0027t be naive. Those legal arguments have never been settled. Some lower courts have ruled that they can own land. Even if the laws had been settled, and in our favor, a thing does not have to be illegal before it causes us trouble.\" Beddle paused for a moment, and then smiled. \"However, if it means the destruction of nearly all the New Law robots, I am willing to contend with a whole world of trouble. The price might be high, but, even so, it would be a bargain. \" Beddle leaned back in his chair and thought for a moment. \"And you believe all this is feasible? That it has a reasonable chance of success?\"\n \"Yes, sir. I won\u0027t insult your intelligence by pretending it\u0027s a sure thing. But I think it can be done.\"\n Simcor Beddle looked at his second-in-command thoughtfully. It was a risky scheme. There was no doubt about that. It was all but a certainty that they would be found out.\n But would that be such a bad thing? There were plenty of people, everywhere on the political spectrum, who would be quite relieved to be rid of the New Law robots. Even if the Ironheads took some heat for it, they would earn a lot of credit as well.\n Besides, how could he possibly turn his back on this opportunity? This was a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Gildern was offering him his dreams on a silver platter. How could he say no? Why would he say no?\n He leaned forward across the table and smiled at Gildern. \"Not only can it be done, Gildern. It will be. It will be.\"\n NORLAN FIYLE SMILED as well, as he listened through the thin partition. Jadelo Gildern rarely made mistakes, but when he did make one, it was of the largest size. The room on the other side of the partition might well have been swept for electronic bugs only a hour before, but that was of no use. Not against an underling with a good pair of ears and a reason to bear a grudge, not against an underling on the other side of a wall made for portability rather than soundproofing.\n He had heard it all. And he was a man with more reasons to speak, and to act, than to keep quiet.\n Simcor Beddle took off on his good-will tour the next morning. Over the next two days, he made his first four appearances, at four little towns, arriving at each town right on schedule.\n But he never arrived at the fifth. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/utopia-isaac-asimov-s-caliban-3/page-17.html","bookId":1730,"book":{"id":1730,"title":"Utopia (Isaac Asimov\u0027s Caliban #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Utopia (Isaac Asimov\u0027s Caliban #3) \n Third in a powerful trilogy that examines Asimov\u0027s Three Laws of Robotics--a challenge welcomed and sanctioned by Isaac Asimov, and written with his cooperation.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/utopia-isaac-asimov-s-caliban-3.jpg","author":"Roger MacBride Allen","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/utopia-isaac-asimov-s-caliban-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:12 AM"}}
