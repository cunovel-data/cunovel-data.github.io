{"id":38506,"no":22,"title":"XXI. Of Kriemhild’s journeying to the Land of the Huns","content":"Let us suffer those heralds onward to ride:—let the minstrel sing How rode that Daughter of Princes through the land far-journeying, And where at the last she parted from Gernot and Giselher. In loyalty and honour had these twain holpen her. When they came where looks over Danube Bergen’s citadel, Then at the last those heroes must bid the Queen farewell, For that backward unto the Rhineland now must they turn the rein. When the near and dear so parted could none from tears refrain. Then Giselher to his sister spake one parting word: “Sister, if ever thou needest help of my counsel or sword, What peril soever threatens, send thou word unto me; Into the land of Etzel will I straightway ride unto thee.” Then kissed she the lips of her kinsfolk, and they parted in love and grief; And with kindly word and with hand-clasp friend of friend took leave, The valiant men of Burgundia and Rüdiger’s cavalcade. Then with the Queen rode onward many a high-born maid, Even four and a hundred fair ones: in bright hues rainbow-dyed Glistened their lovely vesture: broad shields upon either side Went flashing down the highways on the arms of the Hun-queen’s train. Then turned, after fair leave-taking, Volker the valiant thane. Into the land of Bavaria over the Danube they won, And fast and far went the tidings of the long lines riding on, And the many unknown faces. Where stand a cloister’s walls, And where the broad Inn-river into the Danube falls, There in the city of Passau a great prince-bishop abode. From their homes, yea, forth from the palace the folk streamed out to the road {p. 177} Whereby those guests through Bavaria-land came riding in. There met was Kriemhild the lovely by the bishop Pilgerin. Glad were the knights Bavarian to look on that winsome sight, That Queen of Beauty followed by many a maiden bright; And with loving glances and longing those daughters of earls did they greet. Fair harbourage full swiftly was found for guests so sweet. (C) At Pledeling resting-places were prepared for the slumber-tide. All people came forth riding to meet them from every side; And they gave to them whatso they needed with willing hands and free There and elsewhere, and they took it with princely courtesy. Back rode the bishop to Passau with his niece the royal dame; And so soon as unto the burghers of the city the tidings came, That the child of their prince’s sister, Kriemhild the Queen, drew nigh, The merchants greeted her entry with stately pageantry. Now the bishop had looked that a little there should his guests stay on; But Eckwart, Lord of the Marches, said: “Nay, it may nowise be done. We needs must still ride onward to the land of Rüdiger: Many knights unto whom our coming hath been heralded wait for us there.” Now by this known too unto Gotlind the fair one the tidings were; And with diligent haste did the lady and her high-born daughter prepare: For a message had Rüdiger sent her that he held it a seemly thing That to cheer the heart of Kriemhild she should ride to meet her, and bring With her for a guard of honour all her vassal-array So far as Ems the river. Then hasted she to obey; And straightway thronged were the highways with folk that onward pressed, Afoot, or riding, eager to meet that queenly guest. Now was the Queen in her journey come unto Everding. They had passed through the land Bavarian unvexed of the plundering Of the robber barons which haunted the ways, as their wont was aye. Well might they have done a mischief unto so rich a prey; But Rüdiger the noble from peril warded them still: With a thousand knights, yea, haply yet more, had he fenced them from ill. {p. 178} And now was the Lady Gotlind, Rüdiger’s wife, at hand, And with her a host of good knights, a great and gallant band. Now when they had crossed Traun-river by Ems, in the river-mead green, There many a booth fair-builded and many a tent was seen Wherein those guests through the night-tide sweet rest and slumber should win, Ready-reared at the Margrave’s charges to honour his guests therein. From the palace prepared for the lodging of those guests Gotlind the fair Rode forward to meet her Lady: along the highways were Long lines of goodly horses with jingling bridle-reins:— Fair welcome! Fain was the Margrave of all their loving pains. The knights that from eastward and westward along the highway rode Spurred gallantly forth to the meeting: brave horsemanship they showed, Those charging ranks of heroes of many a fair maid seen! In sooth was the good knights’ service well-pleasing to the Queen. When clashed Lord Rüdiger’s vassals with the guests in the mimic war, Many a splintered lance-shaft went upward soaring far From the hands of the gallant heroes as they tilted in knightly wise; And ladies’ smiles were their guerdon, and the light in ladies’ eyes. Now stayed is the tide of combat, and the laughing warriors greet Right courteously the strangers; and forward riding, to meet The Queen, the glorious Kriemhild, doth the Lady Gotlind go. Now knights that in ladies’ service be perfect, have work enow. To meet and to greet his lady rode on Bechlaren’s Lord: Right glad was the noble Gotlind to hail the lost restored Whole and unharmed from the Rhineland and from peril of the way. Vanished her fear and her sorrow as a dream at the dawning of day. So when she had given him welcome, “I pray thee light,” said he, “On the grass with thy bower-maidens, all these which have followed thee.” Then in knightly courtesy busy was many a high-born thane Which waited with eager service on the ladies of her train. {p. 179} Then looked the Lady Kriemhild, and beheld the Margravine Stand in the midst of her ladies. No further rode the Queen; But she checked with bit and bridle the onward-pacing steed, And she bade them from the saddle lift her to earth with speed. Leading the child of his sister the princely bishop strode, With Eckwart beside him, where Lady Gotlind their coming abode. To right and to left all people fell back as onward they came; And the stranger Queen kissed sweetly the lips of the noble dame. With words all lowly-loving did the wife of Rüdiger say: “Now happy am I, dear mistress, and a blessing on this day That in this our land hath given to mine eyes thy face to see! No sight so heart-rejoicing could now have appeared unto me.” “O noble Gotlind,” said Kriemhild, “God guerdon thee for this! If I with the son of Botlung see days of weal and bliss, Well may it be for thee truly that I have been seen of thee.” —Ah, neither of these foreboded the things that were yet to be! Then met with courteous greeting the maidens of either land, And around them tendering service did many a good knight stand; And they sat down after the greeting on earth’s clover-mantled floor. So were they made acquainted which were strangers theretofore, As they poured the wine for the ladies. By this the sun was high, Nor longer lingered thereafter that noble company. On rode they, and came to pavilions broad and fair-arrayed Wherein might perfect service to the noble guests be paid. There till the new day’s dawning they rested through the night. Now the folk of Bechlaren bestirred them that all should be ordered aright, That guests so many and worthy should be welcomed with honour due: Such heed had Rüdiger taken, that nothing lacked thereto. There thrown wide open for welcome were the windows in the walls; Through the castle of Bechlaren flung wide were the doors of her halls. There amid welcoming faces the guests through the gateway rode, And in many a fair-dight chamber by Rüdiger were they bestowed. {p. 180} The Margravine’s fair daughter drew with her maidens nigh To the palace-portal, and welcomed the Queen right lovingly, And there by her side did her mother, the wife of Rüdiger, stand; And maidens to bower-maidens outstretched the welcoming hand, And two by two they drew them with fingers that lovingly clung To a wide hall stately-builded, with tapestries fair-hung. Afront of the windows the Danube-river flowed below. There sat they in merry converse, and felt the cool breeze blow. Of all that befell as they tarried the minstrel may not sing: Yet certes the knights of Kriemhild at such long tarrying Murmured, for now were they chafing that so slowly the goal was won. What gallant knights from Bechlaren thereafter escorted them on! Service the Margrave tendered most loving and manifold. Then gave that Daughter of Princes twelve armlets of red gold Unto the daughter of Gotlind, and raiment lovely-wrought. Into the land of Etzel none fairer had Kriemhild brought. Albeit the gold of the Niblungs out of her hand had been reft, Yet with the little treasure that still unto her was left She won the hearts of all folk that looked upon her face. Great gifts unto Rüdiger’s household she gave of her royal grace. And for her part Lady Gotlind to the guests from Rhineland showed Such high and bounteous honour in the gifts that she bestowed, That hard had it been mid the strangers to find so much as one Who had not of her hands fair-woven vesture or precious stone. So when these guests had eaten, and would forth on their journey again, Her loyal service commended that noble chatelaine In speech most lowly-loving unto great Etzel’s Queen; And Kriemhild embraced at parting the fair young Margravine. Then spake unto Kriemhild the damsel: “If this my Queen content, Well know I, my dear-loved father thereto would gladly consent To send me to thee into Hunland, to wait on my Lady there.” How loyal could be that maiden, full well was Kriemhild ware. {p. 181} All bridled waited the horses before the castle-port, When the noble Queen had taken her leave in gracious sort Of the wife of the Lord of the Marches and the fair young child at her side; And with many a farewell spoken thence did the maidens ride. Seldom indeed thereafter from that day forth met they! Out of Medelick came the people, and stood beside the way With many a golden goblet rich-wrought filled high with wine That the guests might drink, and “Welcome!” they bade them by word and sign. The Lord of the place in his castle dwelt there, Astolf hight: On the road to the Easterlings’ country he set their feet aright: Over against Mautaren by the Danube runs that road. There worshipful observance to the great Queen all folk showed. Of his sister’s daughter the bishop took loving farewell there. That long she might live and prosper how earnest was his prayer, And might for herself earn honour as Helka of yore had done! Ha, what high honour and worship in the hearts of the Huns she won! So they came in a little season unto the Traisem’s flow, And still did the knights of the Margrave heedfully guarding them go, Till far off riding to meet them was a host of the Hunfolk seen. Ha, then was fulness of honour rendered unto the Queen! On the Traisem’s bank did a castle of the Lord of the Hunfolk stand, A passing-stately fortress, well known through all the land; And the same hight Traisenmauer: there Helka dwelt of old, A lady beyond all other exceeding bounteous-souled, Except that other were Kriemhild, for her bounty withal was free. Well might she be henceforth happy after all her misery, For all the people of Etzel her kindness extolled and her grace; Yea, in abundant measure she won the heroes’ praise. Now the majesty of King Etzel was grown so world-renowned, That at every time and season about his court were found All knights on earth most valiant that ever man had known Mid Christian nations and heathen: all gathered round his throne. {p. 182} Year in, year out, around him—such sight none now may see— Were Christian knights and heathen dwelling in amity, Each after his own land’s custom, even as such might fall. So full and so free was his bounty, that aye it sufficed for all. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90348.html","bookId":422,"book":{"id":422,"title":"The Lay of the Nibelung Men","description":"简介： If we accept as our definition of an Epic:(a) A long poem, (b) of an interest not less than national[1], describing (c) in noble language (d) a series of naturally and organically connected actions (e) of heroic actors, we shall find that, while we m...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
