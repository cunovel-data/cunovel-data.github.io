How they bore them at Mass and Tourney","content":"“So chill now groweth mine harness,” said Volker unto his friend, “That I trow in no long season will the night-tide draw to an end. Yea, and I feel by the dawn-breeze that hard at hand is the day.” Then waked they many a hero that still in slumber lay. Now on the guests in the great hall the morning light shone fair, And Hagen fell to question the good knights gathered there If they would go to the minster the chanting of mass to hear; For now after Christian custom the bells of prime rang clear. The chanting was but a discord: sooth, marvel therein was none That Christian men and heathen sang not in unison. Yet minded to go to the minster were they of Gunther’s train; And they rose up all from the couches whereon through the night they had lain. {p. 253} Then did the warriors clothe them in such royal-rich array That to no king’s kingdom ever in any after-day Brought heroes goodlier vesture. But wroth waxed Hagen thereat, And he cried: “It were well ye arrayed you in other raiment than that! Ye know too well of a surety how doth the matter stand. Therefore instead of roses take ye weapons in hand, And instead of caps bejewelled your helmets gleaming bright, Forasmuch as we have full warning of wicked Kriemhild’s spite. This day for our lives must we battle: this unto you I say. Instead of silken tunics ye must wear steel hauberks to-day; And instead of costly mantles must bear shields massy and broad, That if any rage against you ye may nowise be overawed. My well-belovèd masters, kinsmen and liegemen mine, With hearts of sincere repentance draw nigh to the holy shrine, And lay before God Almighty your burden of need and fear; For know ye this of a surety, that death to us all is near. Forget not past transgressions, the sins wherein ye had part, And stand in your God’s presence with humble and contrite heart. Yea, hearken ye all to the warning, every valiant thane— If God in Heaven help not, ye shall hear no mass again.” Onward then to the minster princes and liegemen passed. In the holy outer precinct were they bidden all stand fast By Hagen, that each from other might so be sundered by none; For he said: “As yet none knoweth what by the Huns shall be done. Set down, O ye my kinsmen, your shields before your feet; And, if any in insolent fashion us stranger guests shall greet, With deadly wounds requite it. Lo, Hagen’s rede is this; And thereby shall ye prove by trial that so for your honour it is.” Those comrades, Volker and Hagen, planted them side by side In front of the wide-walled minster: there fixed did they abide; For they did it of this set purpose, that the Queen might enter not Unjostled by their shoulders—unto such stern mood were they wrought. {p. 254} Then came the Lord of the Hunland, and beside him his fair Queen paced. With royal-rich apparel was Kriemhild’s beauty graced. And valiant warriors many in the train of these drew nigh. ’Neath the tramp of the feet of the vassals of the Queen the dust rose high. When the great King beheld them all mail-clad as for fight, Those princes and their liegemen, he cried unto them forthright: “What meaneth this?—behold I my friends in battle-gear? By my troth, it should vex me sorely if any harmed them here! All wrong, whatsoever atonement they asked, would I requite. If to their heart and their spirit any have done despite, I will show unto them and to all men what indignation have I. What redress they demand soever, nothing do I deny.” To the King made answer Hagen: “None doeth despite unto us. It is ever the wont of my masters to go in armour thus, Whose guests they be soever, till three full days have run. We would make our complaint unto Etzel, if a wrong unto us had been done.” Now the word that Hagen answered full well was heard of the Queen. How flashed ’twixt her half-closed eyelids her hate’s glance bitter-keen! But as touching her fatherland’s custom not she would utter the truth, Albeit Burgundia’s daughter had known it full well from her youth. How grim and stern soever was the Queen’s mood unto her foe, Had any revealed her purpose unto Etzel the King, I trow, He had verily prevented the thing that thereafter befell; But their pride thought scorn of complaining, and nought unto him would they tell. To the minster-door paced Kriemhild with a multitude in her train; Yet to step aside at her coming they two would nowise deign Two handbreadths: wroth were the Hunfolk, as men that chafe being wronged, For in passing the stalwart heroes their Queen was jostled and thronged. Wroth with their reckless defiance were Etzel’s chamberlains: Full fain from the path had they thrust them, and angered those insolent thanes, Had they but dared in the presence of the great King to do aught. So then there was thronging and pressing, but more than this was there nought. {p. 255} When again they turned them homeward from holy chant and prayer, High-borne upon goodly chargers hosts of the Hunfolk were. In Kriemhild’s train moreover was many a winsome maid, And warriors full seven thousand in the Queen’s war-band were arrayed. Amidst of her ladies Kriemhild at the casement sat on high At Etzel’s side: that pageant well-pleased he saw sweep by. They would fain see the far-famed heroes ride in the tourney-ring. What gallant Burgundian barons were in presence of the King! Now came Burgundia’s marshal bringing the mighty steeds, And came with Dankwart the valiant to minister unto their needs The squires of the princes and barons, the lords of Burgundia-land; And they brought out the good steeds saddled for the Niblung warrior-band. So soon as they all were mounted, the Princes and their men, Volker the fearless captain gave them his counsel then After their own land’s fashion to close in the wild mellay. Then into the lists the heroes rode in gallant array. That which the minstrel counselled, was none that against it spake. Then in the lists did the clashing and clanging of arms awake. Into the spacious tilt-yard thronged many a thane to the strife: And high over all sat gazing King Etzel and his wife. Unto the place of the tourney six hundred warriors came— Knights were they all of Dietrich—to meet those guests of fame. They would clash in the mimic battle with the sons of Burgundy: Had their lord but given them licence, they had done it joyfully. Ha, they were goodly warriors that rode to the barriers! But tidings of their purpose were borne unto Dietrich’s ears: Forthright their clashing in tourney with Gunther’s men he forbade. He feared for his vassals, lest mischief befall them—good cause he had! And so, when the knights of Dietrich were thus withheld from the fray, On came the men of Bechlaren, even Rüdiger’s array; Five hundred in front of the palace rode under buckler-fence. Well pleased had been the Margrave, afar had they tarried thence. {p. 256} On through the press fast riding he came to his retinue, And he spake unto all his liegemen: “It must needs be known unto you How chafed and ungentle of spirit the warriors of Rhineland be. Ye therefore refrain from the tourney, and so shall ye pleasure me.” So when these war-fain heroes had turned from the lists away, Then came Thuringia’s champions, as telleth the ancient lay, And valiant men from Daneland a thousand with these there were. Then the shards of the shivered lances went leaping high through the air. Into the ringing tourney Irnfried and Hawart rode, But the champions of the Rhineland their onset proudly abode; And they clashed with the knights Thuringian in the hero-sport of spears: Full many a goodly shield-rim did the lightening lances pierce. Then came the good knight Bl?del, and followed him thousands three. Etzel the King and Kriemhild watched full eagerly The meeting of charging squadrons, the gallant glorious fray: But in fierce joy Kriemhild waited till her hate should have its way. (C) On a vision she dreamed, the fulfilment whereof ere long was seen— “If haply any be wounded, then, ah then, I ween, This sport may grow into earnest: then over my scornful foe Should I stand in revenge triumphant—small were my grief, I trow!” Then clashed Gibeke and Schrutan with the strangers front to front, And with them Hornbog and Ramung, after the Hunnish wont: Yet stayed by the knights Burgundian were the onsets of them all. The splintered spear-shafts whirling flew over the palace-wall. Yet, how featly they rode soever, it was nought but empty sound. With clanging of smitten bucklers rang wide echoes round From mansion and hall, as the champions of Gunther clashed with the Hun. High praise and glorious honour by his mighty men were won. So strenuous was their pastime as in grapple of giants they met, That drenched were the saddle-housings with foam-flakes and with sweat From the goodly chargers dripping, as in gentle and joyous sport The heroes against the Hunfolk matched them in chivalrous sort. {p. 257} Then the noble viol-minstrel, Volker the aweless, said: “I trow these knights be faint-hearts; to meet us fairly they dread. Yet hear I talk of their hatred, how bitter against us it is. Sooth, never a better season may they find to prove it than this! Now once more unto the stables,” again Lord Volker cried, “Let the squires lead back the horses. Peradventure again will we ride When draweth the day unto even, if haply the time suffice. Perchance to the knights Burgundian will the Queen give valour’s prize!” Then into the lists came riding one of such lordly mien That in all the host of the Hunfolk no goodlier man was seen. Perchance from a casement a dear one gazed on his pomp and his pride: Like a maid was he richly apparelled, yea, like a young knight’s bride. Then again in his scorn spake Volker: “Who now can forbear to smite? He must needs take a buffet, yon minion of women, yon carpet-knight. He hath set his life on the hazard: not I will be turned from my path! As for yon wife of King Etzel, nothing I reck of her wrath.” “Now nay, by my love I charge thee,” said Gunther, “do not thus! All folk will blame if the first blood be wantonly shed by us. Let the Huns be the first wrong-doers: it were more for our honour, I ween.” —And all this while King Etzel at the casement sat with the Queen. “I make one more in the tourney,” cried Hagen instantly. “We will let yon dames at their casements and the knights that throng us see How knightly is our jousting: yea, it were right well done. In any wise, from our foemen small praise shall by us be won.” Volker the battle-eager again rode into the strife: That onset to many a woman with sore heart-anguish was rife. From breast to back his lance-head hath pierced that noble Hun. That stroke wept many a maiden and matrons many an one. Straightway returning Hagen came with his hero-train; With his own threescore warriors he rode the lists again. On pricked they to where the minstrel had shown them such grim sport. —Etzel the while and Kriemhild gazed down on the stormy court. {p. 258} Now also Burgundia’s princes would leave not void of aid In the midst of unnumbered foemen that minstrel unafraid. With a thousand heroes behind them, the flower of chivalry, They rode the lords of the tourney, and their hearts were proud and high. Now when that knight of the Hunfolk in death had been thus laid low, A cry brake forth from his kinsmen of lamentation and woe. All through the throng were they shouting, “Now who hath done this thing?” Men answered, “Volker the dauntless, the lord of the viol-string.” They shouted, “Take ye the bucklers, and grip ye the sword in hand!” Those friends of the slaughtered Margrave, the lords of the Hunfolk’s land. Fain were they to smite the minstrel to death for that grim deed; But down from the casement hasted the King with eager speed. Then rose from the midst of the Hunfolk uproar that on all sides rang. Down to the earth from their saddles the Kings with their liegemen sprang: Behind them they put their horses, the men of Gunther’s array. Now cometh in haste King Etzel, with intent to part the fray. From a man of the slain Hun’s kinsmen, who chanced anigh him to stand, He gat him a sword keen-whetted, yea, tore it out of his hand, And therewith beat back his people, and he cried in exceeding wrath: “May I not keep faith with the heroes? Must I break my plighted troth? If ye had slain this minstrel in revenge for the deed he hath done, On the word of a king, I had hanged you—I had hanged you every one! As touching the spear-thrust given to the Hun—I marked him ride:— It was not of his will, but his charger stumbled in his stride. These be my guests: ye shall suffer that in peace they all go hence.” So himself became their escort. Led were the horses thence To the stalls, for squires there waited, and henchmen not a few, With swift obedience ready to render them service due. So back to the hall of the palace his guests did the host-king lead: He suffered in his presence no wrathful word or deed. They set the tables in order, the water the pages bare: —Yet many a most stern foeman had the Rhineland warriors there. {p. 259} (C) Albeit it irked King Etzel, a great throng into the hall Followed the lords Burgundian, and weapons had they all. On the guests they scowled their hatred, as they passed to the feastful board; For they burned to avenge their kinsman when time and place should accord. (C) “That ye come to the banquet in armour clad and with sword on thigh,” Spake the lord of the land to his people, “is foul discourtesy Now whoso dareth to offer an insult to any guest Shall atone with his head for the outrage. Huns, ye have heard mine hest.” Long was it, ere at the banquet seated were all those chiefs, The while the heart of Kriemhild was racked with manifold griefs. “O Prince of Bern,” she pleaded, “this day must I of thee Entreat both help and counsel in my sore perplexity.” Then unto her the good knight Hildebrand answer made: “Whosoever slayeth the Niblungs doth it without mine aid. What treasures tempt him soever, he taketh his death with the gold. Never yet have they been vanquished, those warriors aweless-bold.” (C) “This toucheth none save Hagen, who hath done foul wrong unto me: Siegfried, my lord, my belovèd, he murdered treacherously. Who severeth him from his fellows, my gold shall guerdon him well. My spirit should inly sorrow, if hurt to the rest befell.” (C) But the old lord Hildebrand answered: “Nay, how might such thing be That one should slay him only? Surely thyself mayst see That if any beset him, his fellows with him will live or die. Yea, small and great together, if he fell, in death would lie.” Then added and spake Lord Dietrich with knightly courtesy: “O mighty Queen, I pray thee, put all such pleading by. Never to me have thy kinsmen done any deed of wrong That I should defy to battle such valiant thanes and strong. For thy prayer, O noble Lady, small honour to thee is therein That so thou devisest mischief against the lives of thy kin. They came under pledge of friendship hither to Etzel’s land. It must needs be that Siegfried remaineth unavenged by Dietrich’s hand.” {p. 260} So when in the Bernese champions no treachery might be found, Unto Bl?del her faith she plighted, by oath and by handclasp bound To give him a fair wide lordship, which Nudung possessed of yore— But ere long, smitten of Dankwart, he remembered her gift no more. She said: “O Bl?del my brother, unto thee for help I call. My deadliest foes be gathered in yonder palace-hall, Even they which murdered Siegfried, my belovèd lord, time was. Unto him were I bounden for ever who now would avenge my cause.” Unto her made answer Bl?del: “Know thou, O Lady and Queen, In Etzel’s presence I dare not let this hatred be seen So long as unto thy kinsmen he showeth his favour still. Never the King would forgive me, if I wrought them aught of ill.” “Nay, fear not thou, Lord Bl?del; thy friend evermore will I stand, And with guerdon of my silver and my gold will I fill thine hand, And will give thee to wife that fair-one who was plighted Nudung’s bride, And in cherishing her beauty shall thine heart be satisfied. Her land withal and her castles will I give to be thine of right; So shalt thou live in joyance evermore, O noble knight, When thou shalt be lord of the marches that were Nudung’s in days gone by: Yea, all that to-day I promise will I then do faithfully.” Then seemed unto Bl?del the castles and the gold a guerdon fair, And the witchery of beauty to his heart became a snare. Fain was he by battle-prowess to win that fair-one to wife: But foredoomed thereby was the warrior to cast away his life. He spake to the Queen: “To the feast-hall pass thou unto thy place. Ere these be ware of the peril, a tumult will I upraise. For the wrong he hath done thee shall Hagen make atonement at last, When this King Gunther’s liegeman in bonds at thy feet I cast. Now arm you all, my liegemen!” to his vassals did Bl?del cry. “We will forth against our foemen where in harbourage they lie. My Lady, the wife of King Etzel, constrains me to this assay. We must needs all set on the hazard life and limb this day!” {p. 261} So when from Bl?del the warrior the Queen had wrung consent To make beginning of conflict, to the feast-hall thence she went Beside the great King Etzel, and their knights behind them pressed. A terrible doom for the strangers she purposed within her breast. (C) In what order they passed to the banquet unto you shall the song declare: Men saw great kings and mighty the crown before her bear; Yea, high-born princes many and thanes of high degree Before the Queen did service in great humility. (C) The King to his guests appointed their seats through the feast-hall wide, And the chiefest and noblest among them were nearest set to his side. For Christian knights and heathen were diverse meats prepared, Yet all to the full were feasted, for all in his wisdom he cared. (C) Apart in the place of their lodging for the squires was a feast arrayed, And there before them the sewers all things in order laid With diligent heed that nothing of all they lacked should fail:— Too soon were revel and joyance turned into woe and wail! Now since the flame of battle could be lit in none other way,— For the old pain crying for vengeance in Kriemhild’s heart still lay,— She caused that her child and Etzel’s to the banquet-board should be brought. How by a vengeful woman could fearfuller deed be wrought? Forth four men went from the feast-hall of Etzel’s following, And returned with the young prince Ortlieb, the little child of the King; And they set him before the princes—and Hagen sat thereby, He through whose murderous hatred that child was doomed to die. So then when the great King Etzel beheld his son brought in, In faith and in lovingkindness he spake unto Kriemhild’s kin: “Behold, my friends and my kinsmen, mine only son is this, And the child of Kriemhild your sister: your friend that shall be he is. If he favour his Rhineland kinsmen, a stalwart man shall he be, Mighty withal and noble, valiant and comely to see. {p. 262} If I live, I will make him ruler of lordships twelve in my land: So service fair shall be rendered to you of Ortlieb’s hand. Therefore I fain would pray you, belovèd kinsmen mine, Whensoe’er again ye be riding homeward unto the Rhine, That ye take him, the child of your sister, in that day home with you, And show all lovingkindness to my son as kinsmen true. Train him in ways of honour, till unto man he shall grow; Then, if to your land a mischief be done of any foe, And he to his strength be waxen, his aid unto you shall he bring.” —And all this speech heard Kriemhild, the wife of Etzel the King. “Yea, well may all these warriors in his loyal faith confide, If ever he grow unto manhood,” grimly Hagen replied; “But the young king is but a weakling, I trow, in outward show. Not oft to the court of Ortlieb shall folk behold me go.” Then the King looked sharply at Hagen, for stung by the word was he, Albeit he answered nothing, of his kingly courtesy; Yet his soul was chafed and indignant, for he deemed it nowise good. Yea, also was Hagen’s spirit nowise in jesting mood. No less than the King were his servants indignant, a princely band, That so evilly Hagen had spoken of the child of the lord of the land. To sit and endure such insult as gall to their spirit seemed; But of that which ere long by the warrior should be done, ah, little they dreamed! (C) Full many that heard it, whose hatred of him already was hot, Would fain have fallen upon him—yea, that would the King, I wot, Had his honour permitted; the hero had then been in evil plight. More cruelly soon did he wrong him, that he slew his child in his sight. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90358.html","bookId":422,"book":{"id":422,"title":"The Lay of the Nibelung Men","description":"简介： If we accept as our definition of an Epic:(a) A long poem, (b) of an interest not less than national[1], describing (c) in noble language (d) a series of naturally and organically connected actions (e) of heroic actors, we shall find that, while we m...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
