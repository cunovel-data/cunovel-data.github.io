{"id":38503,"no":19,"title":"XVIII. How Kriemhild would not return to the Lowland with Siegmund","content":"Then went the old King Siegmund where Kriemhild sat in her woe, And he spake to the Queen: “To our own land homeward now let us go. Guests are we all-unwelcome, I trow well, here by the Rhine. Come with us, Kriemhild belovèd, to our country, thine and mine. That thy kin in the land Burgundian have so evil entreated us In slaying thy noble husband by murder most treacherous, It shall not be remembered against thee: my love shall cherish thy life, For the sake of my son and the noble child he hath left to his wife. Thou, Lady, shalt have dominion, shalt have over all the control That Siegfried gave to thee ever, that lord of the noble soul. The crown shalt thou wear, and the kingdom shall bow beneath thy sway. Thee shall the vassals of Siegfried with willing heart obey,” Then the word to the squires was given, “Home ride we ere eventide!” Out of the field they gathered in haste the steeds they should ride. To dwell mid their deadly foemen was now to their souls as gall. For the journey prepared was raiment of the dames and the handmaids all. But now when the old King Siegmund was at point to ride away, Drew nigh the kinsmen of Kriemhild to plead with her and to pray That still she would stay with her mother in the land of Burgundy. Made answer the joyless-hearted: “Now nay, it can never be! How could I endure it, that ever I should look upon him with mine eyes Who hath dealt with me, the hapless, in such despiteful wise?” But the young Prince Giselher answered: “Sister belovèd, now By a child’s true love I adjure thee, abide with thy mother thou! For them which have darkened thy spirit, for them which have wounded thine heart, No need hast thou of their service; in all that is mine thou hast part.” {p. 147} But she to the knight made answer: “How can it be? Ah no! If I look on the face of Hagen, I must die for utter woe.” “Now nay, O sister belovèd, from this will I guard thee well. With Giselher thy brother here sheltered shalt thou dwell. My love for the death of thy dear lord shall atone in very deed.” And the joyless made answer: “Kriemhild thereof hath bitter need!” Now when in such loving fashion pleaded with her the lad, Their prayers unto his supplication did Uta and Gernot add. Yea, all her loyal kinsfolk entreated her there to stay. “Among all the people of Siegfried no kinsman thou hast,” said they. “They be all unto thee as strangers, as aliens,” Gernot said. “Though the living may love thee, the strongest must needs at the last lie dead. Bethink thee thereof, dear sister: to thine heart speak comfortably. Here tarry with thine own kinsfolk: so shall it be well with thee.” So she gave to her brother the promise, to abide with them in the land. Now by this were the horses gathered for the men of Siegmund’s band; And all to the land of the Niblungs were ready to ride away, And laden upon the horses was the good knights’ war-array. Then unto the bower of Kriemhild went grey-haired Siegmund the King, And he spake to the Lady: “The warriors of Siegfried’s following Stand waiting beside their horses. Forth and away let us ride. The hours unto me are bitter while with Burgundy’s folk I abide.” But the Lady Kriemhild made answer: “My kinsmen have wrought on my will, Even my nearest and dearest, here to abide with them still. None in the land of the Niblungs, say they, of my blood can I find.” Then sore aggrieved was Siegmund that such should be Kriemhild’s mind. And answered and spake the old King: “Lest any deceive thee beware. Thou before all my kinsfolk the royal crown shalt wear, Yea, wear it by right of kingship, even as heretofore. For this shalt thou nowise suffer, that thy lord is beside thee no more. {p. 148} Nay, forth with us do thou journey unto thine home and thy child; Let him not be an orphan, his father dead, his mother exiled. When thy son is grown unto manhood, thy comfort shall he be then: Till then shalt thou have true service of many valiant men.” But she answered: “My dear lord Siegmund, with thee I may not ride. Nay, here with mine own must I tarry, what issue soever betide. In my grief and my wrong to my kinsfolk for comfort and help must I look.” When this was told them, the tidings ill could the good knights brook. With one voice cried they against it: “Our plight may we surely deplore That on us hath affliction lighted now as never before! If here in the land Burgundian thou with our foes wilt abide, Never have heroes ridden to an eviller festal-tide!” But she answered: “In God’s good keeping shall ye fearlessly journey home. I will get for you trusty escort for your warding until ye be come Unto your own dear country. Good knights, farewell each one. Unto your love and compassion I commend my little son.” So when they knew of a surety that they could not in any wise shake Her purpose, the men of Siegfried into bitter weeping brake. Ah, with what deep heart-anguish King Siegmund took farewell Of Kriemhild! Renewal of sorrow on the childless father fell. “A curse on that festal high-day!” the King in bitterness cried: “Never to king and his dear ones did such foul fortune betide As here upon us hath fallen—and that at a feast, good sooth! In Burgundy here shall they see us never again, of a truth!” Then in fierce anger shouted the thanes of Siegfried’s band: “Nay, once more yet may we journey unto this accursèd land, If we find, if we prove of a surety who laid our dear lord low. Amidst his friends have they won them deadly foes enow!” For the last time kissed he Kriemhild. He spake in sorrow’s despair, When he saw her steadfastly purposed to abide with her people there: “Now ride we forth all joyless, as home to our people we go! Now first my depth of affliction and all my sorrow I know!” {p. 149} So rode they without all escort from Worms on Rhine away. Well might they go all-fearless: so stern of mood were they, That if haply foemen in malice had set upon them then, Their heads had their own hands warded, those aweless Niblung men. No leave would they take of any: they shook off the dust of their feet. Yet Giselher and Gernot full lovingly came to greet The old king at his departing; for they sorrowed in his heart-pain, And thereof did they give clear witness, those valiant heroes twain. For to Siegmund spake Prince Gernot exceeding courteously: “Now God in Heaven be witness, of the death of Siegfried am I Wholly and utterly guiltless! Never I heard this said, That any bare him malice. From mine heart do I mourn for thy dead.” Then Giselher the young prince provided them escort fair. So led he unvexed of any the hearts overburdened with care, Even the King and his good knights, back to their Netherland home. Ah, with how little rejoicing their kinsmen beheld them come! Touching all that befell them thereafter the old song holdeth its peace: But at Worms was the plaining of Kriemhild heard without surcease That her heart and her wounded spirit had no comforter, Save one, the loving and faithful, her brother Giselher. But there sat Brunhild the lovely enthroned in her arrogant pride. Little she recked of Kriemhild as from depths of despair she cried. Never in kindness or pity she stooped to the stricken again. But the years stole on, till Kriemhild wrung her heart too with pain. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90345.html","bookId":422,"book":{"id":422,"title":"The Lay of the Nibelung Men","description":"简介： If we accept as our definition of an Epic:(a) A long poem, (b) of an interest not less than national[1], describing (c) in noble language (d) a series of naturally and organically connected actions (e) of heroic actors, we shall find that, while we m...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
