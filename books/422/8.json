{"id":38492,"no":8,"title":"VII. How the Warrior-maid was won to be Gunther’s Bride","content":"Now while thus they communed, their galley fled onward, and drew nigh To that seaward-fronting castle; and now did the King espy High up at the open casements full many a maiden fair, And his spirit within him was troubled that he wist not who they were. Then of his comrade Siegfried straightway questioned he: “Look upon yonder maidens, and say, be they known unto thee, Even they which be downward gazing o’er the sea as we draw anigh? Whosoe’er be their lord, of a surety is their bearing proud and high.” Then spake the valiant Siegfried: “Look keenly and closely now On the faces of yonder maidens, and then confess to me thou Which wouldst thou take, were the choosing accorded to thee as of right.” “Yea, that will I,” answered Gunther, that keen and valiant knight. “I mark, of all those fair ones, at yonder casement one; It is she in the snow-white raiment: like unto her is there none. She of mine eyes is the chosen: so sweet is her beauty’s pride, That, an I might have the decision, it is she that should be my bride.” “By the sight of the eyes hast thou chosen, and a fair choice have they found! Even she is the noble Brunhild, of the beauty world-renowned, {p. 54} The Star of thine heart’s strong yearning, the choice of thy mind and thy will.” King Gunther gazed, and he deemed her ever sweeter and fairer still. Then that Daughter of Kings commanded that her winsome maidens should go From the casements: she would not suffer that there they stand for a show And a feast for the eyes of strangers. Was none dared disobey; Yet that which they did thereafter is told in the ancient lay. They arrayed them in fairest adorning for the stranger knights to see— As fair maids have done ever, since time began to be;— Thereafter through half-drawn curtains they peered, those dainty spies, At the heroes, to feed fair woman’s immemorial desire of the eyes. There were four, and none other heroes which came unto that land. Bold Siegfried led a war-steed from the galley’s side to the strand. And the lovely ladies peering through the casements saw that thing, And they deemed that exceeding worship was rendered to the King. There in their sight was he holding that gallant steed by the rein, That stately battle-trampler, strong and of noble strain; Yea, he held it till King Gunther firm in the saddle sat. So served him Siegfried—service that thereafter he wholly forgat! Then brought he forth of the galley his own good steed withal. Never ere then had he rendered the service done by a thrall, That he should stand by the stirrup while heroes mounted the selle! And those fair ones from the casements that gazed saw all full well. In the selfsame fashion accoutred were those princely heroes twain; For white as snow were their horses, and their raiment white without stain. As the one was, so was the other; and lovely the shield-rims shone On the arms of the heroes hanging, flashing brightness like to the sun. Gleaming with precious gemstones were saddle and breast-band strait. So rode they in princely fashion before Brunhild’s palace-gate; And a chiming of bells all-golden that hung from their trappings was heard As they came into that far country by their princely hearts on-stirred. {p. 55} With spear-head newly-whetted, with goodly-fashioned sword Which hung even down to the spur-tips, on rode each kingly lord. Yea, the glaives of the mighty-hearted were broad of blade and keen. And all was marked of Brunhild, that noble maiden-queen. And with these two princes Dankwart and his brother Hagen came; And these were arrayed, as telleth the tale of olden fame, In raiment of raven blackness, with rich work broidered o’er. New, long and broad and goodly withal were the shields that they bore. From the far land of India came many a precious stone From the which up and down their vesture was a starry splendour thrown. Their galley all unwarded they left, in the surf as it swayed. So they rode to the castle-porchway, those heroes unafraid. They marked towers six and eighty that crowned that fortress-wall, Three palaces wide-builded, and a goodly feasting-hall: It was wrought of the lordly marble, as the lealand grass it was green; And therein amidst of her people sat a child of kings, the Queen. Bars clanged and bolts shot backward, the gates of the burg swung wide. Forth running to meet the strangers the knights of Brunhild hied, And received them as guests be welcomed, into their Lady’s land; And they took in charge the war-steed, and received the shield from the hand. And a chamberlain bespake them: “Yield up your swords unto us, And withal your gleaming hauberks.” “We will nowise suffer it thus; Ourselves be minded to bear them!” cried Hagen of Troneg the grim. Then Siegfried turned, and the manner of the kingdom set forth unto him: “In this burg is it ever the custom according to that I say, That the Queen’s guests go unweaponed within her courts alway. Hence from our hands let them bear them, so all shall be done aright.” Grudging and loth was the yielding of Hagen, Gunther’s knight. They poured them the wine of welcome, they led them to chambers fair. Knights many swift in service in the halls of the palace there were That to and fro were hasting clad all in goodly array; Yet, for all their splendour, their glances to those goodlier four would stray. {p. 56} Now word is brought unto Brunhild, and the tale to her ears hath come Of those unknown knights-errant which have fared to her island-home Sailing over the sea-flood, and attired each man like a king. Then the Maiden royal and lovely fell to questioning: And thus spake the Maid-queen Brunhild: “Now shall ye tell unto me Who the unknown knights-errant may peradventure be Whom yonder I see in my castle, each man like a kingdom’s lord; And for love of whom these heroes have journeyed hitherward.” Then of her train one answered: “I needs must own, O Queen, That of yonder company no man heretofore have I seen; Yet amidst them is one man standing who beareth Siegfried’s guise; And in loyal love I counsel, receive him in gracious wise. And the second his comrade appeareth so worship-worthy to me, That if haply he wield power royal, a king may he verily be Over princely domains far-stretching, if he hold such sway indeed; For he stands mid the rest, meseemeth, as one of royal seed. For the third of these faring-fellows, he seemeth stern of mien, Yet none the less of stateliest stature, O mighty Queen. Swift, keen be his glances as lightning, and flash still to and fro: Dour and quick unto anger his spirit shall be, I trow. For the youngest, of all praise worthy he seemeth in mine eyes. A gallant knight we account him, yet withal of such winsome guise That the grace of a maiden shineth through all his mien high-born; Yet verily might all tremble to deal to him scathe or scorn. For all his gentle bearing and his goodlihead withal, Yet many a comely woman should weep for her lover’s fall, If his wrath to the battle were kindled: right sinewy-shapen is he, In all manner of knightly virtues a flower of chivalry.” Then spake that Daughter of Princes: “Bring royal raiment to me. Now if yon mighty Siegfried to my country be come oversea To seek my love in his wooing, he imperilleth his life. Nowise I dread him so sorely as to stoop to be his wife!” {p. 57} So Brunhild the passing lovely full soon was splendour-arrayed; And there in her train paced hallward many a winsome maid: Five-score, nay more peradventure, all costly-vestured came: And to look on the guests with Brunhild went many a noble dame. To right and to left went marching strong thanes of Isenland, Vassal-knights of Brunhild, each man with his sword in his hand, Five hundred, yea more, it may be—for the guests an evil sight! Then rose from their seats at her coming the Four, those men of might. Now when that Daughter of Princes looked upon Siegfried’s face— Would ye know of her greeting?—she bespake him with cold and stately grace: “Now welcome be thou, O Siegfried, in thy coming to this my land. What meaneth this your journey?—prithee, cause me to understand.” “Exceeding thank do I render, O Daughter of Princes, to thee, That thou deignest to greet me, Brunhild, Lady of Courtesy, Before this knight hath been greeted, who standeth before me in place, For that he is my liege-lord:—Siegfried could well have foregone such grace! He is the King of Rhineland—what need I say of him more? All for thy love have we voyaged far overseas to thy shore. Fixed is his heart to woo thee, whatsoever thereof betide. While yet there is time, bethink thee:—my lord turns never aside. He hath to name King Gunther; wide is his royal domain. For thy love he comes hitherward wooing; nought else he desireth to gain. Forasmuch as he hath commanded, on this journey have I too come. If so be he were not my liege-lord, sooth, I had forborne therefrom.” She answered: “If thou be his vassal, and he thy suzerain, Then must he abide the trial, the tests that I ever ordain. If he stand at the end the victor, I yield myself his wife; But if I overcome—bethink you, ye all have staked your life.” Then out spake Hagen of Troneg: “Suffer us, Queen, to see To what manner of play thou dost challenge. Ere Gunther my lord unto thee Shall yield up the mastery, surely he shall strive with bitter strain. A maiden so passing lovely full well to his wife might he gain.” {p. 58} “He shall cast the massy quoit-stone, and far as it flies shall he leap, And shall hurl against me the javelin—hold not this trial cheap! Ye may lose not honour only: your life and limb be at stake. Therefore, I rede you, bethink you!” So that fair woman spake. Then Siegfried the battle-helper drew the King apart, And he prayed him to speak out boldly all that was in his heart Unto the Queen replying—“Fear not for the end,” he said; “By my cunning devices against her full well will I shield thine head.” Then answered and spake King Gunther: “O child of a royal line, Lay on me what task thou pleasest: were it harder than this of thine, Yet for the sake of thy beauty I abide all willingly. If thou be not won by my wooing, then smite mine head from me.” So soon as the words had been spoken, straightway that Amazon-maid Commanded, as meet she deemed it, that the trial be not delayed; And she caused them to bring her armour, and array for the contest grim, Even a golden hauberk and a shield of ample rim. A silk-lined battle-tunic about her that maiden drew— Nor point nor edge of weapon in fight might pierce it through— Of fine-dressed fells of lions from the land of Libya brought, With broidery round its borders flashing radiant-wrought. Meanwhile her knights were galling those guests with threat and jeer: And there stood Dankwart and Hagen exceeding heavy of cheer; For their souls foreboded the issue that might to their lord betide; And they said in their hearts: “This journey shall we knights dearly abide!” But Siegfried the while, the resourceful, hath hasted swiftly away, Ere any was ware of his going, unto where the galley lay; And he found the Hood of Darkness in its secret hiding-place there, And with speed he did it upon him, and none thereof was ware. With speed he returned: of her warriors found he a great array In the place by the Queen appointed for the wooer’s perilous play: {p. 59} But he passed through the midst of them stealthwise, and still was beheld of none Of the multitude there thronging: by magic thus was it done. For the lists a wide ring drew they where that grim sport should be In the presence of knights of Brunhild, that the trial all might see, Bold warriors full seven hundred; and their weapons of war all bare; And whoso prevailed in the contest, the truth should these declare. Now in the lists stood Brunhild, in her mail of the adamant rings, As though she would straight do battle for the land of all earth’s kings. And all her silken vesture was with gold bands lapped about; But thereunder the lilies and roses of her lovely flesh shone out. Now came to the lists her henchmen, and unto her hands they brought A goodly shield of battle: of the ruddy gold was it wrought With bands of steel hard-welded, a thing for a giant to sway: And under that mighty heart-fence would the fair one play the play. From left unto right within it did a goodly arm-brace pass With emeralds set thereover, green as the lealand grass; And their sight-bewildering sparklings flashed o’er the gold thereof. Sooth, valour he needed and prowess who would win that maiden’s love! Stood a boss out in front of the buckler, as the olden bard hath sung; It was three whole spans in thickness, yet lightly its mass she swung. With burnished steel and with gleaming gold full rich was the shield; And scarce could her chamberlain, holpen of three, bear this to the field. Now soon as Hagen the stalwart beheld that Targe of Dread, Muttered the Lord of Troneg sorely disquieted: “How is it with thee, King Gunther?—thou hazardest limb and life! She whom thou fain wouldst be wooing were a very demon-wife!” Now telleth the song of the raiment of that fair-clad Amazon. With glistering silk of the Orient her battle-doublet shone— Ah, it was costly and queenly!—flashed in beholders’ eyes From the vest of that Daughter of Princes full many a stone of price. {p. 60} A mighty spear broad-headed then brought they unto the Queen, Which she hurled evermore in the Contest of Wooers, a javelin keen, Gigantic, stubborn-shafted, heavy and long, and wide Were the fierce death-whetted edges thereof on either side. Of the weight of that fearful javelin be marvellous stories told. Of five-score pounds of iron was forged its massy mould: Three of the warriors of Brunhild staggering bare that spear. Then the heart of the noble Gunther grew heavy with his fear. Under his breath he whispered: “What task have I now in hand? Though the Foul Fiend rose out of Hell’s Pit, against her how should he stand? Were I, with my life delivered, once more beside the Rhine, Long should she bide untroubled by any wooing of mine!” (C) Well may ye deem what burden of disquiet his spirit bare. Then all his harness of battle they set before him there: And soon the mighty Rhine-lord lapped in his war-mail stood. But the spirit of Hagen was darkened, and he chafed in bitter mood. Then out spake Hagen’s brother. Dankwart the valiant: “I rue— Yea, my inmost soul repenteth that hither we came to woo! Good knights, time was, men called us! Shall we tamely yield our breath? Here in the land of the stranger shall a woman do us to death? Sore vexed am I for our folly, that ever we came to her land! Ha, if that my brother Hagen but grasped his sword in hand, And I had also my war-glaive, soon these should abate their pride, And should droop the eyes of scorning, yon vassals at Brunhild’s side! I would teach them to go softly, full well I ween!—O yea, Though oaths had I sworn a thousand to keep the peace this day!— Ere I saw my belovèd liege-lord lie trapped in a foul death-snare, Doomed to forsake life—quotha!—because this woman is fair!” “Ay, and we would unshackled from this land win forth clear,” Answered his brother Hagen, “had we but the armour here That we lack for the clash of the onset, and the trusty battle-blade; Then soon should the pride be humbled of yonder stalwart maid!” {p. 61} Full well overheard were his murmurs of the Lady royally born. She cast back over her shoulder a smile of careless scorn:— “And he deemeth himself so valiant?—e’en bring them hitherward Their armour, and give to the heroes each his keen-edged sword! (C) As little I reck of them whether their harness and swords they bear,” Spake that Daughter of Princes, “or weaponless stand there. I fear the strength of no man that is known of me unto this day; Yea, and I look to o’ermaster yon king in the battle-play.” When, after the Maid’s commandment, unto these were their weapons brought, The face of the valiant Dankwart for very joy flushed hot. “Play now what play ye be minded!” he cried, that goodly thane; “Unfettered now is Gunther: we have our swords again!” Once more of the might of Brunhild terrible proof is shown: Men into the ring come bearing an exceeding massy stone, Most huge, a quoit for a Titan, broad withal and round. Scarce twelve of her thanes could bear it into love’s strange battle-ground. Even this ever hurled she in contest, when the flight had been sped of the spear. Thereat were the lords Burgundian thrilled with foreboding fear. “Who is this that my lord would be wooing?—Beshrew her!” Hagen cried: “In the nethermost hell might she fitly be plighted the Foul Fiend’s bride!” On her snow-white arms the Maiden her tunic-sleeves uprolled, And she stretched forth her hand to the arm-brace of the shield, and took fast hold: She hath swung up on high the javelin—lo, the banners of battle unfold!— Then the hearts of those two heroes at the fire in her eyes waxed cold. And except in that moment Siegfried to his friend’s help had drawn nigh, She had reft the life from Gunther the King right certainly: But he stole to his side all viewless, and softly touched his hand; Then, as at a spirit’s presence, well-nigh was the King unmanned; For the bold knight thought: “Who touched me?—do I stand on enchanted ground?” For, look as he would all round him, no man thereby he found. {p. 62} Then a whisper came—“It is Siegfried: I, thy companion, am here. Thou therefore in yon Queen’s presence be wholly void of fear. Yield up from thy grasp the buckler, and let me bear it for thee, And lay up in thine heart the counsel which now thou hearest of me:— Be thine all feigning of action, by me shall the work be done.” Then leapt his heart for gladness, when he knew it was Siegmund’s son. “Ever hide thou my cunning devices, speak word thereof unto none: So by the proud King’s Daughter shall little enow be won, Through thee and thine overthrowing, of the glory she thinketh to glean. Behold her, how yonder she standeth with scornful-arrogant mien!” Then, then that royal maiden hurled across the field With her uttermost strength the javelin at the mighty and broad new shield Which braced on his left arm firmly the son of Siegelind bore: Leapt sparks from the steel, as the wind-blast sweepeth the chaff from a floor. The fang of the mighty javelin through the shield’s whole thickness crashed; And it glanced from the warrior’s armour, that the fire from the ring-mail flashed. Back from the shock went reeling either stalwart thane:— Except for the Hood of Darkness, of a surety had both been slain! Yea, from the mouth of Siegfried the valiant burst forth blood; But he sprang full-height in a moment; then gripped that war-thane good The selfsame spear which the maiden through the rim of the shield had sped. Then Siegfried’s strong hand backward swung it above his head. But he said in his heart: “I will pierce not the maiden sweet to see.” Backward therefore the deadly point of the lance turned he; Then hurled he the spear butt-foremost full at the rings of her mail: Loudly they rang at the smiting of the hand that was strong to prevail. Flashed out the fire from her hauberk, as flies dust caught by the wind. Ha, that was a cast most mighty of the son of Siegelind! For all her strength, she prevailed not against that shock to stand. In veriest truth, such spear-cast came never from Gunther’s hand! {p. 63} But the Fairest of fair ones, Brunhild, leapt to her feet forthright:— “For thy good spear-cast I thank thee, O Gunther, noble knight!” She cried; for she weened that the hero by his own strength this had done, Nor dreamed she how that behind him had stolen a mightier one. Sped she from that place swiftly, for her fury stung her as flame: She grasped the stone, she upheaved it, that royal Amazon dame. Far thence from her hand that boulder with her uttermost might she swung, Then after the cast far leapt she, that her mail-rings clashed and rung. Twelve fathoms away from the caster crashed that stone to the ground; But farther yet than the quoit-flight did the high-born maiden bound. Then strode that swift war-helper, Siegfried, where lay the stone:— Men saw but the arm of Gunther, the speeder thereof saw none. Mighty of limb was Siegfried, valiant and tall was he; Farther than Brunhild he hurled it, he leapt yet farther than she; And he added thereto a marvel, a deed of magic might, That he bore in his leap King Gunther, by the power of the Hood of Night. Lo, now is the great leap taken; behind on the earth lay the stone. Gunther it was, the war-thane, whom men saw there alone. Then the face of Brunhild the lovely with helpless anger burned. —Lo, Siegfried from King Gunther the imminent death hath turned! Then unto the host of her vassals Queen Brunhild looked, and she cried, When she saw that hero standing safe on the lists’ far side: “O ye my friends and liegemen, hitherward come straightway! Ye be all unto this King Gunther vassals from this day.” Down laid each valiant warrior his weapons from his hand, And low at the feet they bowed them of the Lord of Burgundia-land; Yea, unto Gunther the mighty bent many a valiant knight, For they weened he had won that contest by his own unaided might. With chivalrous grace and in loving wise he greeted the maid; And now that Queen of Beauty her hand in his hath laid, And to him all rule she yielded over all her wide domain. Then glad in his heart was Hagen, that bold and knightly thane. {p. 64} She besought that noble chieftain to her palace builded wide With her to return, and thither strode Gunther at her side. There all men fearing before him in homage lowly bent. So the brethren, Dankwart and Hagen, thereat were well content. Now Siegfried, the swift war-helper, in all deep craft was wise: Back bare he the Hood of Darkness, and hid it from all men’s eyes. Then he passed to the hall, where fair ones sat in their bravery; And he spake unto King Gunther, and cunningly dealt he:— “Now why, Lord King, dost thou tarry, that the games not yet begin Whereof this Queen made promise, and challenged thee herein? Let us now full soon behold them, and know of the trial’s stress.” —As nothing knowing of all things he spake in his wiliness. Then spake that Daughter of Princes: “How might this marvel befall That thou of the games, Lord Siegfried, hast witnessed nought at all, Wherein was the victory given unto this King Gunther’s hand?” Out spake and answered Hagen, the knight of Burgundia-land: “Thou, Queen,” he said, “didst trouble our spirit exceedingly: Therefore was Siegfried the good knight abiding by ship and sea In the hour when the Lord of Rhineland overcame in the wooer’s play; So nought thereof he knoweth,” did Gunther’s liegeman say. “Now welcome to me be the tidings,” Siegfried the hero replied, “That here in such wise a wooer hath humbled thy tameless pride, And that some one lives to be master at last over thee and thine! Now shalt thou, noble maiden, fare with us to the Rhine.” Made answer that high-born Lady: “Not yet may this thing be, Ere I have summoned my kinsmen and them of my vassalry. It is all unmeet that so lightly I depart from this my land: Ere then must my nearest and dearest be bidden from every hand.” Through the length and the breadth of her kingdom she made her messengers ride; And all her friends and her vassals she gathered from every side. {p. 65} Wherefore in swift obedience unto Isenstein came they; And to each and to all of them gave she most royal-rich array. Yea, day after day came riding from far, came early and late, The best of the folk of Brunhild in throngs to her fortress-gate. “Beshrew our folly,” cried Hagen, “in consenting to this thing! To our own undoing await we Queen Brunhild’s following. If these with all their war-might throng into this land thus— Queen Brunhild’s secret purpose is all unknown unto us,— What if she be wroth against us? Then were our plight forlorn: So were the noble maiden for our utter discomfiture born!” Then answered Siegfried the mighty: “This will I countervail. So will I deal, that the purpose that disquieteth you shall fail. Them that shall help I will bring you hitherward unto this shore, Even chosen knights, such a war-host as ye have not seen heretofore. Ye shall ask not concerning mine absence: I will journey away from this place. God have your honour in keeping, and guard it safe for a space! Soon shall ye see me returning: a thousand men will I bring, And these the mightiest war-thanes that ever followed king.” “Only not long do thou linger,” the King made answer again, “Forasmuch as we of thine helping be most exceeding fain.” He said, “Ere ye see me returning of a truth shall the days be few: And this shall ye tell Queen Brunhild, that hence I was sent of you.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90334.html","bookId":422,"book":{"id":422,"title":"The Lay of the Nibelung Men","description":"简介： If we accept as our definition of an Epic:(a) A long poem, (b) of an interest not less than national[1], describing (c) in noble language (d) a series of naturally and organically connected actions (e) of heroic actors, we shall find that, while we m...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
