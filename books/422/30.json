{"id":38514,"no":30,"title":"XXIX. How Hagen refused to rise up in Presence of the Queen","content":"Now did those thanes far-famous each from other turn, Hagen the Lord of Troneg, and Dietrich the Hero of Bern. Then over his shoulder glancing did Gunther’s liegeman gaze Keenly around for a comrade, and he marked him in little space. For anigh Prince Giselher standing Volker he straightway espied, Volker the viol-minstrel; and he prayed him, “Stand by my side!” For well had he proved his spirit, how grim he was in fight, And in all that a knight beseemeth a fearless warrior wight. The lords Burgundian left they standing amidst of the court; But the twain in the sight of all men strode with lion-port Alone across the bailey, and in front of a palace wide. They cared not who should withstand them, they faced all dauntless-eyed. They sat them down on a settle before the palace-wall Over against the windows and the doors of the Queen’s own hall. On their mighty limbs was gleaming their royal-rich array; And many an one who beheld them much marvelled who were they. Many an one of the Hunfolk, as on wild beasts of the wold, Gazed open-mouthed upon them, on the heroes haughty-souled. And Etzel’s Queen through a casement beheld that terrible twain, And the heart of Kriemhild the comely was darkened afresh with pain. She thought upon all her sorrows, and she wept for grief and shame. Then on the thanes, the liegemen of Etzel, amazement came, As they marvelled what should have troubled the royal heart of the Queen; And she answered, “The deed was Hagen’s, O good knights battle-keen.” Hotly they answered their Lady: “What deed hath of him been done? Lo, of good cheer we beheld thee and blithe but a little agone. {p. 241} Whosoever hath done thee a mischief, be he never so valorous, So thou but bid us avenge thee, with his life shall he answer to us.” “Unto him for aye were I bounden who avenged me on my foe. What boon he may ask soever ready am I to bestow. I bow at your feet in suppliance!” cried King Etzel’s wife. “Avenge me upon this Hagen! Let him forfeit limb and life!” Then armed them the valiant champions; sixty by tale they were: For love of their Lady Kriemhild forth of the hall would they fare And fall upon Hagen and smite him, the battle-dauntless lord, And with him the viol-minstrel: all they were of one accord. But the Queen looked on her champions, and marked their slender array, And in wrathful indignation to the heroes did she say: “From such manner of desperate emprise, I counsel you, refrain! Ye be all too few to grapple with Hagen in battle-strain. How valiant and mighty soever the Hero of Troneg be, The man that sitteth beside him is mightier far than he, Volker the viol-minstrel: a very fiend he is. Ye may nowise meet yon heroes with so scanty a band as this.” So when they had heard that warning, four hundred warriors more Clad them in battle-harness. With longing exceeding sore Was the heart of the Queen a-hungered for vengeance for her wrong. Therefrom were the valiant champions into grim straits brought ere long. And so soon as armed for the onset she saw her vassal-train, To the warriors battle-eager the Queen spake yet again: “Now tarry ye here for a season; stand ye still for a space. With my crown on mine head yon foemen will I first meet face to face. Hearken as I reproach him for the wrongs he hath done unto me, This Hagen of Troneg, vassal of Gunther of Burgundy. I know him so high-hearted, that his crime he will scorn to deny. What shall befall him thereafter from avengers nought care I.” Then the valiant viol-minstrel, the lord of the strings, was ware Of the high-born Daughter of Princes, as her feet came down the stair {p. 242} That led from the palace-portal. Soon as he saw that sight, Unto his warrior-comrade spake Volker the dreadless knight: “Behold now, O friend Hagen, and mark as she draweth nigh Who as guests hath bidden us hither with purpose of treachery. Never so many warriors saw I follow a queen With sword in hand drawing nigh me, and with faces battle-keen. Of this art thou ware, friend Hagen, that to thee are they foemen fell: Wherefore I give thee counsel, take heed that thou guard well Thy life and thy knightly honour. I trow such rede is good; For in very deed meseemeth they come in angry mood. There is many a man amongst them broad-chested and stalwart of frame. Whoso would keep life scatheless, betimes let him see to the same! I mark how under their vesture glittering hauberks they wear: What deed thereby they purpose I know not, neither care.” Made answer in scornful anger Hagen the aweless man: “Well know I, for my destruction is all their plot and plan; And for this are the gleaming weapons that yon men bear in hand. But for all they may do, shall I yet ride back into Burgundy-land. Now tell unto me, friend Volker, by me art thou minded to stand If these be fain to beset me, yon men of Kriemhild’s band? Lo, by thy love I adjure thee, tell me thy mind herein, And my love and my loyal service for ever shalt thou win.” “Yea, of a surety I help thee,” the minstrel made reply; “And though I beheld against us a king of the earth draw nigh With all his knights about him, so long as endureth my life, Through fear will I ne’er draw backward one foot from thy side in the strife.” “Now God in Heaven reward thee, Volker, thou peerless of worth! Though all these rise up against us, what need I more on earth? If thou but stand mine helper, as now thou hast said in mine ear, These knights have need to be wary of coming a step more near.” “Now,” said the viol-minstrel, “rise we up from our seat In presence of this King’s Daughter, as before us pass her feet; {p. 243} So render we due honour unto a high-born queen, And by courtesy do we honour unto ourselves, I ween.” “Nay,” Hagen replied, “if thou love me, in no wise do this thing. Yon knights will be puffed up haply with vain imagining That I did it of failing courage, and were minded to flinch from her face. But I,—for no soul among them will I rise up from my place. From such honour to her refrain we; it better beseemeth us so. What, should I render her homage who hath set her to be my foe? No, that will I do never so long as endureth my life! What reck I of the malice of this King Etzel’s wife?” Across his knees did Hagen in haughty defiance lay A flashing glaive of battle, and with restless splendour-ray A jasper shone on the pommel—spring grass were not so green. Full well did Kriemhild know it, for Siegfried’s sword had it been. She saw the brand, and remembered, and anguish it was to see. Of gold were the hilts, and the scabbard all crimson broidery. The olden grief was rewakened, and fast did the hot tears flow. In sooth, with none other purpose had Hagen done it, I trow. Then close to his side on the settle Volker the unafraid Drew a viol-bow strange-fashioned, a mighty and long steel blade: Yea, as a sword was it shapen, and keen it was and broad. Thus sat these knights in the presence of a throng of their foes unawed. Of such high worth they accounted themselves, that fearless twain, For dread of any foeman never a whit would they deign To rise from the place of their session. Now stood before them there That high-born Daughter of Princes, and a bitter greeting she bare; For she spake: “Now say, Lord Hagen, who sent a bidding to thee That thou darest hither to journey to my land thus hardily, Albeit full well thou knewest what deeds unto me thou hast done? Hadst thou been prudent of spirit, into peril thou hadst not run.” “Me?—no man hath bidden me hither,” with careless scorn he replied. “Hither to this thy kingdom were three knights bidden to ride, {p. 244} And these same knights be my liege-lords, and I am their liegeman true. Whensoever they wend to a high-tide, my wont is to be there too.” She said: “This also tell me—why diddest thou that deed For the which the hatred I bear thee is but thy rightful meed? Thou, thou didst murder Siegfried!—my lord and my love didst thou slay For whom I must needs mourn ever unto my latest day.” “Tush! this sufficeth,” he answered. “Why idly waste thy breath? I still am the same—that Hagen who dealt unto Siegfried death, To the mighty-handed hero. Dearly he paid at last For the flouts that the Lady Kriemhild upon Brunhild the fair had cast. Dream not, O Queen most mighty, that I will conceal or deny That of all the scathe and the mischief done to thee guilty am I. Let whoso dareth avenge it!—let woman or man essay! I have heaped thee the measure of sorrow, if I be not a liar this day.” “Ye hear him, knights! He confesseth all shamelessly,” she cried, “This crime that was cause of mine anguish! What unto him may betide In requital for this, I care not, O vassals of Etzel the King!” But her thanes looked each upon other with glances wavering. Had they closed that instant in conflict, those two companions, I trow, Right soon had exacted homage to their prowess from the foe, As oft in the days passed over they had proved in battle-storm. The thing they had undertaken now feared those men to perform. Then spake a knight to his fellows: “Why look ye so upon me? The deed that erewhile I promised, fulfilled may it nowise be. No mortal’s gifts shall beguile me to barter away my life. To our own destruction hither were we lured by Etzel’s wife!” Then spake and answered another: “As thou art, so am I. If one would give to me towers with the ruddy gold heaped high, Against yon viol-minstrel in battle I would not stand. I have marked his eagle-glances, and I fear the might of his hand. Yea, and I knew yon Hagen in his youth long years ago. It needs not that any should tell me of the prowess that I know: {p. 245} In battles two-and-twenty have I seen him play his part. Unto many a wife made widow hath he given sorrow of heart. Yea, he and Walter the Spaniard upon many a foray fared; And here under Etzel’s banner full many a deed they dared For the King’s renown: they have proved them so oft in foughten field, That men must needs unto Hagen the palm of honour yield. Yet a child in years was the warrior what time he won such praise, And now are they men grey-headed which were boys in those far days; But now hath he gained war-cunning, and grimmer than he is none, And he beareth the great sword Balmung by a deed of darkness won.” So ended their vaunting, for no man dared battle with such stern foes. In the heart of the Daughter of Princes the anguish-tide high rose, As backward recoiled her champions: ay, death seemed all too near At the hands of the viol-minstrel—good cause had they for fear! How oft do men’s hearts fail them, that they shrink from an emprise aghast When faced by friend that standeth at friend’s side loyal and fast! Ay, intermeddlers in quarrels, if wisdom they have to refrain And to take heed unto their goings, may deliver themselves from bane. Then spake the dreadless Volker: “Now for ourselves have we found The truth whereof we had warning, that here foes swarm all round. Let us pass on then to the Princes, where in the palace they are, That none may beset our masters unawares with array of war.” “Good; lead thou on, I follow,” did Hagen answering say. And thence went those two comrades; and there in the hall saw they Those knights, and the Hunfolk greeting thronged them all about. Then the voice of Volker the dreadless like a trumpet-blast rang out, As he cried to his lords the Princes: “How long are ye minded to stay To be thronged and pressed thus tamely? Ye should to the King straightway, And hear in his presence-chamber what is his mood unto you.” Then the good knights and valiant set forward two by two. For the champion of Bern, Lord Dietrich, in fellowship took by the hand The mighty ruler Gunther, the King of Burgundia-land; {p. 246} And with Gernot the valiant hero was Irnfried handed there; And with Giselher to the palace went the noble Rüdiger. But, howsoe’er companioned were the rest, to the hall as they hied, Never did Volker and Hagen leave one another’s side, Save only in one grim conflict, until on their death they came, Which was cause of sorrow and weeping unto many a noble dame. On passed to the hall of the presence with the Princes a gallant train, A thousand of their vassals, each man a valiant thane. There were threescore knights moreover of that royal company, Warriors whom Hagen the dauntless had brought from his seignory. Hawart and Iring, chieftains of Etzel’s own war-band, Went with Burgundia’s Princes to the palace hand in hand. Dankwart withal, and Wolfhart, an earl of high degree, Bare them amidst of the concourse with knightly courtesy. So now when the Lord of Rhineland passed through the palace-door, Etzel the King wide-ruling would tarry no whit more: He leapt adown from his high-seat when he saw him standing there. Never was welcoming given by king unto king more fair. “Welcome be thou, Lord Gunther! Lord Gernot, welcome to thee, And to Giselher your brother! I bade you Princes three, With greeting and all true service, from Worms beyond the Rhine. Welcome to me, King Gunther, be all these vassals of thine. Be ye twain also welcome, good knights, to my festival, Volker the valiant champion, and thou, Lord Hagen withal. Unto me and my wife be ye welcome here in the land of the Hun: Messages unto Rhineland hath she sent you many an one.” Made answer Hagen of Troneg: “Her words of love have I heard. Had I not in my masters’ service hither to Hunland spurred, O King, to render thee honour had I come unto thy land.” Then the host right noble and royal took each dear guest by the hand; {p. 247} And he led them unto the high-seat, and set them at his own board. For the guests the drink of welcome the cupbearers hasted and poured, Mead, wine, and mulberry-brewis, into golden goblets wide; So they hailed with gladsome welcome those thanes, Burgundia’s pride. Then spake the great King Etzel: “O guests, I needs must avow That nought on the earth more welcome to mine heart could befall me now Than cometh, O knights, by your presence, for to see you here am I fain; And thereby hath the Queen’s heart gotten relief from yearning pain. Sooth, oftentimes had I marvelled wherein I had haply transgressed, In that, though I had won to my feast-hall many a noble guest, Yet ye, the chiefest, have never deigned to my land to ride: But now at the last I behold you, and mine heart is satisfied.” Answered a knight great-hearted, and Rüdiger made reply: “Well may ye rejoice to behold them, for their knightly honour is high; And this can my Mistress’ kinsmen in the face of the world maintain. And they bring to thy palace-portals full many a hero-thane.” On a fair Midsummer even they came, those guests renowned, To the court of Etzel the mighty. Full seldom hath it been found That the guests of a king had greeting so fair as the heroes won. And by this was the hour of feasting, and the King to the board led on. In the midst of his guests sat never a host more gracious-willed. There were meats in abundant measure, and with wine were the cups aye filled. Whatsoever a guest might crave for, straightway it lay at his side, For honour to heroes whose prowess had been published far and wide. (C) Ere this had the great King Etzel on a mansion spacious and fair Spent measureless toil and trouble, and nought for the cost did he care. Palace and tower rose stately, with chambers therein untold, And a lordly-fashioned feast-hall, in the midst of a great stronghold. (C) He had caused his wrights to uprear it long and wide and high, To lodge the knights unnumbered that sought to him ceaselessly, And all the host of his liegemen: for twelve kings mighty of sway, And warriors worship-worthy, had he in his war-band aye, {p. 248} (C) Yea, more than king had ever whose name to the minstrel is known. So lived he blithely with kinsmen and vassals about his throne; And the good King’s halls with thronging and gladsome tumult were loud That rose from his valiant warriors, and his heart was high and proud. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90356.html","bookId":422,"book":{"id":422,"title":"The Lay of the Nibelung Men","description":"简介： If we accept as our definition of an Epic:(a) A long poem, (b) of an interest not less than national[1], describing (c) in noble language (d) a series of naturally and organically connected actions (e) of heroic actors, we shall find that, while we m...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
