{"id":38515,"no":31,"title":"XXX. How Hagen and Volker kept Watch while Men slept","content":"By this was the daylight ended, and nearer the night-tide drew. But perplexed were the way-worn heroes, for as yet they nowise knew Where they should find them couches for the rest of the slumber-tide. Then Hagen put it to question, and by him were they certified. For unto their host spake Gunther: “God prosper you of his grace! We would fain go hence to our slumber: thou have us excused for a space. Tomorn we return right early, if this to the King seem best.” Then the host with blithe leave-taking let all depart to their rest. But the Queen’s folk thronged and beset them, and pressed on every side. Then out spake Volker the dreadless, and unto the Huns he cried: “What mean ye to bar and to cumber our feet, discourteous crew? If ye from our path avoid not, mischief shall light upon you! Upon some this bow of my viol so heavily shall smite, That whoso there be that love them shall weep for their woeful plight. Hence from our path! Meseemeth it were best that ye block not our way! Knights these name them—but little enow of the knight have they!” The while that the viol-minstrel spake thus angerly, Around him Hagen the dauntless cast a scornful eye; And he said: “Ye have heard good counsel from the minstrel battle-keen. Get you hence to your lodging, ye men of Kriemhild the Queen! Whatsoe’er be your purpose of malice, now shall it nowise speed. Come early to us to-morrow, if ye fain would essay some deed, {p. 249} And leave us way-worn warriors to rest in peace this night. It was ever the wont of true men to do their deeds in the light.” Then brought they the guests Burgundian to a hall both great and wide; For all that throng of warriors was it dight for the slumber-tide With couches exceeding splendid: long and broad they were. —There trusted Kriemhild to tangle their feet in murder’s snare. With tapestries of Arras were the couches overspread. Wrought all of radiant loomwork, and strown was every bed With glistering silks Arabian, the richest that eye hath seen, And coverlets lay thereover that gleamed with lordly sheen. And rich rugs, some of ermine fashioned, lay in sight, And some of the dusky sable, whereunder through the night They should rest them lying softly till shone the light of day. Sooth, never a king with his vassals in state more lordly lay. “Alas for the place of our resting!” the young Prince Giselher cried, “And alas for our friends and our kinsmen that hither with us have hied! With what fair words soever my sister hath bidden us come, We have won, I sorely fear me, through her hate to the Net of Doom!” “Nay then, put by misgivings,” said Hagen, “and rest you well. Myself will to-night be your watchman and slumber-sentinel, And faithfully will I guard you till morning bringeth the day. Fear nought till then: thereafter let him keep his head who may.” Low bowed them unto him all men, and thanked him courteously; Then on their beds they cast them. Few moments fleeted by Ere hero by goodly hero untroubled rest had won. And now ’gan Hagen the dreadless his harness of battle to don. Then answered the viol-minstrel, and the good thane Volker spake: “If thou scorn my request not, Hagen, with thee will I undertake This night the watching in armour, till the shadows flee away.” Then heartily thanked he Volker, and thus did the warrior say: {p. 250} “Now God from his Heaven reward thee, Volker, of men most dear! In all my sorest peril would I have none other near Than thee alone, whensoever into hard straits I were brought. Full well will I requite thee, so death forestall me not.” Then did these twain array them in mail bright-glittering; And over his arm his buckler did either warrior sling. Forth of the great hall went they afront of the door to stand, And they guarded the guests there lying with loyal heart and hand. Then Volker the battle-eager unclasped his buckler good From his arm, and upright set it, that propped by the wall it stood. Then unto where was his viol he turned him back again, And rendered his tired friends service worthy of such a thane. For under the great hall’s doorway he sat on the threshold-stone— More valiant viol-harper never hath mortal known. When the strings thrilled under his fingers and the soul of the viol woke, Low murmured their thanks unto Volker the proud, the homeless folk. The walls and the rafters echoed as the chords pealed loud and clear— In might and in music-cunning was the hero without a peer:— Then sweeter and softer they whispered like the ripple of murmuring streams, And so were the heavy-hearted lulled into happy dreams. So when all slumbered, and Volker was ware that their cares were stilled, Then over his arm the warrior drew once more his shield; And forth he strode from the portal, and afront of the door he stood To ward his friends and kinsmen from Kriemhild’s avengers of blood. Now hard on the hour of midnight, or earlier perchance, He marked, this Volker the dreadless, the gleam of a helmet glance Far away through the darkness. The vassals of Kriemhild were there, Full fain to have done some mischief to the sleepers unaware. (C) Now ere these were sent of Kriemhild to take the prey in the snare, She said: “If ye come on them sleeping, in God’s name have a care That of all this company one man, and only he, be slain, Hagen the faithless traitor: your hands from the rest refrain.” {p. 251} Then spake the viol-minstrel: “Friend Hagen, see to it now That we bear this burden of peril together, I and thou. Lo, in front of the hall in armour I see folk gathered near. If I may divine their purpose, they come to fall on us here.” “Hush!” answered Hagen: “suffer that they come unto us full close. Ere they be ware of our presence, shall the helms of yonder foes With these good swords be cloven that shall swing in the hands of twain. In evil plight unto Kriemhild will we send them back again!” Then ware was one of the warriors of the Hunfolk suddenly How that the door was guarded. In haste to the rest spake he: “The deed that we had purposed, now doth fate forestall. I behold the viol-minstrel stand guard afront of the hall. He wears on his head a helmet whose splendour flames through the dark, As adamant hard and burnished, dintless withal and stark. Bright glow the rings of his hauberk, as fire that flashes afar; And beside him standeth Hagen. Well warded the strangers are!” Then backward they faltered: when Volker marked how they turned to flee, Straightway unto his comrade he spake full angerly: “Now suffer me from the hall-way to go to yon men in mail: I will speak with the vassals of Kriemhild, and ask of the night-tide’s tale.” “Now nay, an thou lovest me,” Hagen answered, “thou shalt not so! If once thou leave this portal, yon battle-eager foe With onset of swords may bring thee right soon into such hard strait, That I needs must help, though our kinsmen thereby met an evil fate. For if we twain in battle were compassed by yon false crew, Haply some two of their comrades, or four, or ever we knew, Into the great hall rushing, therein might work such scathe On our slumbering friends, that we surely should rue it unto our death.” And again made answer Volker: “At the least let us do this then, To cause them to know of a surety that we have espied yon men. {p. 252} Then they, those vassals of Kriemhild, can nowise lie unto us That they sought not to do to the King’s guests a deed most treacherous.” Then cried the viol-minstrel, and the throng of the Huns he hailed: “How cometh it, valiant heroes, that ye come thus armour-mailed? Be ye fain, O vassals of Kriemhild, to ride in quest of spoil? Then take ye me and my comrade to help in your knightly toil.” But no man rendered him answer. Then wrathful waxed his mood. “Out on you, caitiff dastards!” cried that warrior good. “To murder us in our slumber—for this be ye prowling nigh? Never yet to such noble heroes was done such treachery!” Right soon thereafter the story unto the Queen was told How the men she had sent had failed her: then waxed she heavy-souled. New plots she devised, for her hatred was cruel as the grave. Destined thereby to perish was many a hero brave. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90357.html","bookId":422,"book":{"id":422,"title":"The Lay of the Nibelung Men","description":"简介： If we accept as our definition of an Epic:(a) A long poem, (b) of an interest not less than national[1], describing (c) in noble language (d) a series of naturally and organically connected actions (e) of heroic actors, we shall find that, while we m...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
