{"id":38505,"no":21,"title":"XX. How Queen Kriemhild was Wooed for the King of the Huns","content":"It befell in the selfsame season, when the Lady Helka had died, And Etzel the King would be wooing another woman for bride, That his kinsmen in council assembled spake unto him of the fame Of a certain proud queen widowed, that Kriemhild had to name. Since Helka the Queen, the lovely, was taken from him and from life, They said: “If haply thou thinkest on another noble wife, In blood and in virtue the highest that ever prince hath won, Take Kriemhild: Siegfried the Hero was her lord in days bygone.” {p. 157} But the mighty King made answer: “Nay, how may this thing be? A heathen am I; baptismal waters have touched not me; And she is a Christian woman—the thing may never befall. If ever she came, this surely a miracle might one call!” But the valiant knights made answer: “Perchance may she do that same For the sake of thy great dominions, for the sake of thy glorious name. In any wise might one seek her to be thy noble queen. She is worthy, O King, thy wooing; never lovelier woman was seen.” And the noble King made answer: “Unto whom of you all be known The people that dwell in Rhineland, and the realm their princes own?” Answered the Lord of Bechlaren, the knightly Rüdiger: “Known be its princely rulers unto me from my birth-tide year. Lo, these be Gunther and Gernot, valiant knights and true, And of these is Giselher youngest, and ever the Princes do What sorteth wholly with honour and chivalry high-souled: Yea, they walk in the steps of their fathers, the stainless heroes of old.” Answered and spake King Etzel: “Friend, unto me declare If indeed it well beseemeth that the crown at my side she wear. If indeed she hath such beauty as flieth on rumour’s wing, Mine high-born kinsmen shall never repent their counselling.” “She is such as was once my Lady: in beauty is she no less Than thy Queen the noble Helka; she is peerless in loveliness Through all the wide world’s compass, a bride for a king to wed. Who winneth her love, of a surety may his heart be comforted.” Said the King: “By my love I charge thee, Rüdiger, win me this bride; And if ever to me fair Kriemhild shall be joined at the marriage-tide, To the uttermost of my power shalt thou have guerdon of me; And thou shalt have fulfilled my pleasure in faith and in fealty. I will bid my treasure-keepers freely to give unto thee Horses and goodly raiment, whatsoever thy need shall be, That thou and thy journeying-fellows in joyance ever may live. Yea, as a great king giveth, for thine ambassage so will I give.” {p. 158} Answered the Lord of the Marches, the mighty Rüdiger: “If I sought of thee aught of thy bounty, not for mine honour it were: Blithe will I go unto Rhineland at my good Lord’s command, Of mine own wealth full-furnished: I received it all of thine hand.” Made answer the great King Etzel: “When think ye forth to fare To the wooing of the winsome? God take you into his care, And crown with honour mine envoys unto her, my wife that shall be, Let fortune but aid us, and Kriemhild incline to us graciously.” And Rüdiger made answer: “Ere we ride from thy land away, We must needs provide us with armour and royal-rich array, To stand in the presence of princes with honour worthy of thee. I think to lead into Rhineland five hundred knights with me; So when in the realm Burgundian men look on me and mine, With one voice all the people shall cry in the land of Rhine: ‘Never so far from his kingdom was such a goodly band Sent forth by a king, as Etzel hath sent to Burgundia-land!’ Know thou, O King most mighty,—let the thing not give thee pause— The wife of the chiefest hero on earth, of Siegfried, she was, Of Siegmund’s son: that champion aforetime here didst thou see. Right worship-worthy might all men account him verily.” Answered and spake King Etzel: “If she was his worthy mate, That noble prince’s glory is so exceeding great That wholly it were for mine honour to call her my queen, I trow. So great is the fame of her beauty that mine heart goeth out to her now.” Answered the Lord of the Marches: “This then remaineth to say— Hence will we take our departing on the four-and-twentieth day. Unto Gotlind the well-belovèd, my wife, will I send the word That I for the wooing of Kriemhild am on ambassage sent of my Lord.” To his wife at Bechlaren tidings sent that knightly thane. Joyful at once and sorry was that high-born chatelaine That her lord should be sent forth seeking another bride for his King; For unto the dear dead Helka did the love of her heart still cling. {p. 159} So when the messengers’ tidings to the Margravine were told, Unwelcome it came in a measure, and the Lady was sorrowful-souled; For she feared she should see no mistress like her of the days of yore. Ever she thought on Helka, and her heart within her was sore. Seven days had passed, and the Margrave rode from the land of the Hun. Greatly rejoiced King Etzel that his hest so swiftly was done. In the city Vienna already was prepared their festal array, And from setting forth on his journey would the knight no longer delay. Gotlind his wife in Bechlaren for his coming eagerly stayed; And the Margravine, Rüdiger’s daughter, a young and winsome maid, Was fain to behold her father and them of his vassal-throng. Sooth, that was a loving waiting of ladies fair and young. Ere Rüdiger the noble forth of Vienna’s gate Rode to Bechlaren, ready for him did all things wait On the sumpter-beasts full laden, the raiment and warrior-gear. So strongly guarded they journeyed, no spoiler dared draw near. So when they were come to Bechlaren, and had passed through the gates thereof, For all his warrior-fellows that knightly host of his love Bade lodging fair be provided, and all was done as he willed. And the Lady Gotlind hailed him with eyes with gladness filled, Even she and her dear-loved daughter, the fair young Margravine. No sweeter sight than the coming of her father had she seen. When came out of Hunland the heroes, she saw them joyful-eyed, And with smiling lips of greeting the high-born maiden cried: “Welcome be now my father, and ye his vassal-train!” Thereat to their lord’s young daughter many a gallant thane In knightly courtesy bent him, and rendered thank unto her. Well knew the Lady Gotlind the mind of Rüdiger; For when in the hush of the night-tide by Rüdiger’s side she lay, With loving speech she questioned, and the Margravine bade him say {p. 160} Whither away from Hunland by his lord the King he was sent. “Gotlind my wife,” he answered, “I will tell to thee all his intent: This charge my lord hath given, that I woo him another bride, Inasmuch as Helka the lovely, the wife of his youth, hath died. Therefore to win for him Kriemhild now to the Rhine ride I; And she, if she will, mid the Hunfolk shall be throned in empery.” “God grant it may fall,” said Gotlind, “according to this thy word! A tale of such glory and honour of that lady have we heard, She might comfort our hearts for Helka whom we lost in the days bygone: We might well mid the Hunfolk gladly behold her set on the throne.” Answered the Lord of the Marches: “Heart’s dearest, lady mine, These friends that with me be riding from this land on to the Rhine— I would have thee with hand all-bounteous on these of thy wealth bestow; For when heroes be rich-appointed, with hearts uplifted they go.” “No man of them all,” she answered, “so he at my request Take all that I freely offer, but shall have what suiteth him best, Ere thou from Bechlaren departest with all thy vassal-train.” Answered the Lord of the Marches, “Of thy bounty am I full fain.” O me, what costly loom-work from her treasures forth she bare! Thereof had the noble warriors raiment enough and to spare. With diligence did she array them wholly, from neck to spur. What vesture soever pleased him was chosen of Rüdiger. On the seventh morning thereafter rode from Bechlaren away That host with his train of warriors: weapons of war had they And store of costly raiment, through Bavaria-land as they pressed. Such steel-clad strong wayfarers no spoiler dared molest. So then on the twelfth day’s morning to the land of Rhine they came. Swiftly the tale of their coming flew on the wings of fame. Full soon to the King and his kinsmen did the city-warders show That guests were come from a far land. And now would Gunther know— “Doth any man know yon strangers? If it be so, let him declare.” Men looked on the sumpter-horses, and the heavy loads they bare; {p. 161} How rich were the alien heroes might all discern thereby: Then all through the wide-wayed city they lodged them royally. So soon as men saw these strangers through the streets of the city ride, They gazed on the long procession with wonder eager-eyed, Sore marvelling whence these barons to the land of the Rhine had come. “Know’st thou,” the King asked Hagen, “who these shall be, and wherefrom?” Answered the Lord of Troneg: “Not yet have I looked on them well. So soon as mine eyes have marked them, doubt not but I shall tell From what far country hither hath ridden their knightly array. They must needs be far-off dwellers if I know them not straightway.” So when into many a hostel those guests of a king were brought, King Etzel’s herald arrayed him in vesture richly wrought, Even he and all his fellows, and they rode to the palace thus; And the fashion of their raiment was exceeding glorious. Then spake the valiant Hagen: “As I call up things long past,— For in sooth many days have fleeted since I saw yon baron last,— Such are they in semblance, methinketh, as Rüdiger now might be, Out of the land of the Hunfolk, in port and in valiancy.” “Meseems it is past believing,” the King made answer again, “That unto this far country should journey Bechlaren’s thane!” Yet scarce had the word of misgiving from the lips of Gunther flown, Than by Hagen of a surety was the knightly Rüdiger known. Then Troneg’s lord and his kinsmen to meet that stranger stept, As valiant thanes five hundred down from the saddle leapt. Courteous greeting and loving those Hunland envoys had. Sooth, never a great king’s heralds had come so royally clad. Then Hagen of Troneg lifted his voice, and he cried aloud: “Now unto us be welcome these gallant thanes and proud! Welcome the Lord of Bechlaren and all his valiant ones!” Yea, hailed with abundant honour in truth were the warrior Huns. King Gunther’s nearest kinsmen with welcoming hands drew nigh, And to Rüdiger did Ortwein, fair Metz’s warder, cry: {p. 162} “No guests so passing welcome to our hearts for many a day Have we looked upon in Rhineland: sheer truth is that I say.” Then one and all for his greeting they thanked that princely thane; And into the Hall of the Presence paced Rüdiger and his train. There they beheld King Gunther begirt with barons bold; And he rose from his throne to greet them, like a great king courteous-souled. With welcome how royal-courteous those heralds did he meet! How eagerly did Gunther and Gernot his brother greet That stately guest and his good knights! Worthy thereof they were. Then by the hand did Gunther the King lead Rüdiger: He brought him unto the high-seat whence himself had risen but now; And he bade pour out for his guest-friends—and with joy they obeyed, I trow— The sparkling mead of welcome, and the choicest of all wine That man might find by searching in the lands that fringe the Rhine. Came Giselher and Gere to bid the guests all-hail; Dankwart withal and Volker, for these too heard the tale Of the strangers worship-worthy. Blithe were they all of mood As they greeted in Gunther’s presence that noble knight and good. And now to his liege-lord Gunther did Hagen of Troneg say: “With loving service ever should these thine earls repay The kindness the Lord of the Marches showed unto us of old. Now let the husband of Gotlind be requited manifold.” Then spake King Gunther: “From asking will I no more delay:— How fare thy Lord and thy Lady tell unto me straightway, Etzel and Queen Helka, which rule the Hunfolk’s land.” Answered the Margrave: “Gladly will I do my Lord’s command.” Then rose he up from the high-seat; uprose his vassals all; And he answered and spake unto Gunther: “If this indeed may befall That thou givest me, King, free licence, without more tarrying With willing lips will I utter the message that I bring.” {p. 163} And the King said: “Whatsoever the charge of thy message be, With friends do I take not counsel ere I grant thee liberty To speak out all thy message unto me and my friends, O guest. All honour shall be accorded thy petition and thy request.” Spake that true-hearted herald: “Unto you by Rhine which dwell In all manner of loyal service my King commendeth him well And to all thy friends and kinsmen, the vassals of thy throne. In faithfulness utter-loyal is this my message done. The noble King requesteth that ye mourn his hapless lot; For his people be sitting joyless: our Lady and Queen is not. The wife of my good Lord, Helka the mighty, low is laid, Whereby are young lives orphaned, even many a tender maid, Children of noble princes, whom she fostered in bower and hall, Whereby the whole land sitteth dark-shrouded in sorrow’s pall; For now, ah me, have they no one whose love shall bless them and ward. Long shall it be ere assuaging come to the grief of my Lord!” “God guerdon him,” said Gunther, “that so graciously he commends His loving and courteous service unto me and these my friends! Gladly I hearken the greeting borne this day unto me, And willing service I tender from me and mine by thee.” Outspake a Prince Burgundian, and the good knight Gernot said: “Well may the world sit mourning that Helka the fair is dead; For in her did princely virtues and the law of kindness reign.” “This witness is true: I have seen it,” said Hagen the high-born thane. But again that noble herald, Lord Rüdiger, spake on: “Lord King, now suffer me further: mine errand not yet is done. I would utter the word of my dear Lord, the which by my mouth he saith. He liveth in sorrow exceeding since the Lady Helka’s death. They have told my Lord that Kriemhild sitteth a widow alone, Now that Siegfried is dead. If it be so, if the truth unto him hath been shown, Then if thou, O King, accord it, beneath the crown shall she stand Before the knights of Etzel. I have spoken my Lord’s command.” {p. 164} Answered and spake King Gunther of his princely-courteous mind: “She shall hear my will in the matter, if her heart be so inclined. Thereof will I certify you in three days from this day. Or ever I prove her heart’s wish, why should I say thee nay?” Thereafter they gave fair lodging unto all their guests straightway. So kindly were they entreated that Rüdiger needs must say That amid King Gunther’s liegemen good friends had he found enow. Glad service did Hagen render for his kindness of long ago. There did the Lord of Bechlaren till the third day’s dawning abide; And the King dealt prudently, calling his counsellors to his side; And he asked of his friends and his kinsmen if good in their sight this thing Seemed, that his sister Kriemhild should wed with Etzel the King. “Yea, good in our eyes it seemeth,” said they with one accord Save Hagen alone: unto Gunther he spake, that valiant lord: “If thou be wise and prudent, hereof take thou good heed, That, be she never so willing, thou never consent to the deed.” “Wherefore,” made answer Gunther, “should I his wooing withstand? What kindness soever or blessing the Queen may have of mine hand, That will I grant her gladly. Sister she is unto me. Yea, ourselves might seek such alliance, if such for her honour be.” But again made answer Hagen: “Nay, put this counsel by! Did ye but know this Etzel and his might so well as I— If thou, as thou saidst in mine hearing, unto hers add thy consent, Above all men thou most surely shalt have chief cause to repent.” “Wherefore?” said Gunther. “Lightly may I ward me against this, To come so nigh to his presence that through any malice of his Hurt I should be or imperilled, although she be wedded to him.” “Never will I approve it!” made answer Hagen the grim. Then the King bade summon Gernot to his presence and Giselher, And he asked of these two princes if good in their eyes it were That the Lady Kriemhild be wedded to the mighty Lord of the Hun: And of these, save Hagen only, there spake against it none. {p. 165} Then answered the Prince Burgundian, Giselher the knight: “Now surely shouldst thou, friend Hagen, deal by her according to right. Make good unto her that sorrow thou hast brought upon her ere now. Whatsoever shall be for her profit, ungrudging suffer thou. Yea, thou hast brought on my sister such passing bitter pain”— So Giselher, peerless hero, unto Hagen spake again— “That, how stern soe’er were her hatred, thy due hast thou but received. Never by man hath woman of joy been so bereaved!” “O yea, full well I know it: who knows it, nought care I! But, if she take this Etzel, and see her hour draw nigh Wherein she may compass her vengeance, she will do us what hurt she can: And verily then in her service shall be many a mighty man!” Made answer Gernot the dauntless, and unto Hagen he said: “Nay then, long time may we tarry, yea, till these twain be dead, Ere unto the land of Etzel the Hun-king journey we. Let us deal with my sister truly: for our honour this shall be.” Thereto made answer Hagen: “I say—gainsay it who dare— If once the high-born Kriemhild the crown of Helka wear, Whatsoever she may of mischief, that unto us will she do. Ye knights, let be, I counsel: better shall this be for you.” Then Giselher spake in his anger, the fair Queen Uta’s son: “We be not in any wise minded to be traitors every one! Whatsoe’er may befall her of honour, let us be glad thereof. Whatsoever thou sayest, Hagen, I serve her in faith and love.” When Hagen heard that saying, he was wroth and bitter of mood. But Giselher and Gernot, the haughty knights and good, And the King, the mighty Gunther—in one mind stood these three: If this should be Kriemhild’s pleasure, they would grant it ungrudgingly. Spake Gere, Lord of the Marches: “This word unto her will I bring That none shall let her from yielding her love unto Etzel the King Unto whom in fear and in homage many a good knight bends. For all her past wrongs suffered unto her may he make amends.” {p. 166} Then into the presence of Kriemhild passed that gallant knight. She gave to him gracious welcome, and he spake the word forthright: “Well mayst thou blithely greet me, and give me the messenger’s meed For tidings of good fortune and days from sorrow freed! One seeketh thy love, O Lady: lo, here his heralds be. He is noble among the noblest that in honour and majesty Have ruled over royal dominions, or a knightly crown have worn. Proud knights be his suitors. This message from thy brother to thee have I borne.” Then answered the sorrow-burdened: “Now God forbid that ye, Even thou and all my kinsmen, should make a mockery Of me in mine affliction! How should I shadow the life Of a man that hath known the heart’s love of a true and faithful wife?” Earnestly she gainsaid it. Then came in twain unto her, Gernot the knight her brother, and the young prince Giselher; And lovingly did they pray her to be comforted from her woe, And to take the King to her husband, for that this to her profit should grow. Yet howsoever they pleaded, was none could turn aside The heart of that Queen of Sorrow to be another’s bride. So they ceased, but they prayed her, “Suffer in any wise this thing, An thou wilt nought else, to look on the herald of Etzel the King.” “Yea,” answered the noble Lady, “this thing will I not deny. Upon Rüdiger the knightly, the flower of chivalry, Will I look with heart ungrudging: had another the messenger been, Yea, any save this man only, my face should he ne’er have seen.” And she said: “Unto this my bower let the friend of the King draw near At morning-tide to-morrow; mine answer then shall he hear: Yea all that mine heart hath determined with mine own lips will I tell.” Then she turned her again to her mourning, and the tears of her sorrow fell. Now Rüdiger the noble desired none other grace So much as this, to be suffered to see her face to face; {p. 167} For he knew the all-prevailing power of a wise man’s tongue; And he thought, “If the thing may be compassed, the Queen shall consent ere long.” At early morn scarce ended was holy prayer and song, When the heralds drew near: around them pressed a mighty throng To gaze on the knights to the palace which rode with Rüdiger there: In the splendour of their raiment right gallant thanes they were. Kriemhild the while, the high-born, in sorrow-stricken mood For Rüdiger sat waiting, that noble knight and good, Not decked as a queen, but in raiment that served her day by day; But clad were her bower-maidens in royal-rich array. At his coming she rose, and to meet him to the bower-door she went, And with gracious greeting welcomed the herald of Etzel sent. With none save comrades eleven he came before the Queen, And with worshipful honour was welcomed: never princelier envoys were seen. They bade them unto the high-seats, even him and his knightly train. The while in the presence of Kriemhild stood the margraves twain, The noble knights and valiant, Eckwart and Gere withal. But by reason of Kriemhild’s sorrow heavy of cheer were they all. Sat in their Lady’s presence many a comely maid; But never the flood of the weeping and mourning of Kriemhild was stayed. Her raiment over her bosom was wet with the hot tears’ flow. And the noble Lord of the Marches beheld, and grieved in her woe. Then spake that courteous herald: “O Daughter of Kings, I pray For myself and my fellow-farers which have come from far away, That thou of thy grace wilt suffer that now in thy presence we stand And utter to thee the message that we bring from our fatherland.” “This grace do I freely accord thee,” the sad Queen made reply; “Speak whatsoe’er thou desirest, for purposed now am I Gladly to hear that message: good herald and true thou art.” Yet all through the courteous bidding discerned the reluctant heart. {p. 168} Then the Knight of Bechlaren, the Margrave Rüdiger, spake the word: “Unto thee, O Lady, Etzel the mighty King my Lord In love and in faith doth commend him; his greeting I bear to thy land; And good knights many he sendeth, his suitors for thine hand. He maketh thee faithful proffer of love that shall banish pain; All constancy of affection from his true heart shalt thou gain, Even such as had Helka, who nearest lay to his heart of old— The heart that remembers her goodness in lone grief manifold.” Then spake unto him Queen Kriemhild: “Lord Margrave Rüdiger, If of mine heart’s affliction any man were ware, He would counsel me never to hearken if another man should woo, Who have lost the best and the dearest that ever woman knew.” “Wherein is there comfort for sorrow,” answered the valiant thane, “More than in love of a true heart? Whoso this treasure may gain, And hath won whom his heart hath chosen, and filled the void thereof, He proveth that for sorrow there is no salve like unto love. And if thou to my noble master wilt yield thy love, and wed, Twelve crowns of mighty kingdoms will he set upon thine head, Yea, and of thirty princes my Lord shall give thee the lands; Subject are they, overmastered by his all-conquering hands. Thou shalt be withal liege-lady of many a warrior bold Which were vassals to my mistress Helka in days of old, And of many a high-born lady from princely lineage sprung That to her once rendered service”—spake on that winning tongue— “This also the King shall give thee, he bade me say unto thee, So thou yield to wear beside him the crown of royalty, Power, even the highest that ever in the hands of Helka lay; All the warrior-vassals of Etzel thee also shall obey.” “Ah me! how could I ever,” Queen Kriemhild mournfully cried, “Incline mine heart hereafter to be any hero’s bride, Even I, whom death hath stricken through one with such bitter grief That unto my life’s end never from pain shall I find relief?” {p. 169} “O mighty Queen,” the Hunfolk unto Kriemhild made reply, “Their life who dwell with Etzel so royally fleeteth by, That a dream of delight shall thy days be, if thou hearken our counselling. O, many a gallant baron doeth homage to Etzel the King. And the bower-maidens of Helka and they that be here with thee Shall wait upon thy pleasure in one bright company; And many a knight beholding these shall be glad of heart. For thy good shall it fall, O Lady, if thou choose the better part.” Then she spake like a courteous lady: “Awhile from speech refrain Till the morning-tide of to-morrow; then come ye to me again. So touching this your petition will I tell you mine intent.” And the valiant barons of Hunland thereto must needs consent. So when in hall and hostel lodged and feasted they were, That noble Lady commanded to send to her Giselher, And withal her mother Uta; and to these twain did she say: “No life save weeping and mourning remaineth to me for aye!” Spake Giselher her brother: “Sister, mine heart foresees— And I count it herein true prophet—that thy pangs and thy miseries In King Etzel’s love shall vanish: if thou share his life and his throne, Let who will speak against it, meseems it shall well be done. For all thou hast lost,” said her brother, “can he make amends unto thee. From the River Rhone to the Rhine-stream, from the Elbe to the uttermost sea, There is no king so mighty that men have known or seen. Well might thine heart be gladdened that he chooseth thee for his Queen.” She answered: “O brother belovèd, counsel not this, I implore! Meeter for me are weeping and wailing evermore. What have I to do with a palace, in the presence of knights to shine? Long since my beauty hath faded, if beauty ever was mine.” Now speaketh the Lady Uta to the daughter she loveth, and saith: “Nay, do thou, daughter belovèd, as thy brother counselleth. Hearken the voice of thy kinsfolk, and good days so shalt thou know. Too long have I seen thee sitting in lamentation and woe.” {p. 170} Unto God then earnestly prayed she the path of her feet to show; For, albeit hers should be raiment and silver and gold to bestow, As of yore when she dwelt with her husband, when his life within him was whole, The glorious hours of the old time could no more gladden her soul. Aye in her heart was she musing: “And can I link my life With a husband that is a heathen—and I, a Christian wife? Reproach must then be my portion through all the earth, and shame. Though he gave the whole world’s riches, not so could I stain my name!” So even there did she leave it. The livelong night till the day With deep heart-searchings haunted on her bed that lady lay; And her eyes, the starry-shining, from tears were never dry, Till she rose, and passed to the mass-tide when the morning sun was high. Now also unto the mass-tide were come those princes three; And they took the hand of their sister, and spake to her lovingly, Still counselling her unto marriage with the Lord of the Hunland folk: But never the light of smiling o’er the face of sadness broke. Then sent they for Etzel’s heralds once more to her presence to come— For now from the land of Gunther would they fain be faring home Bearing consent or denial, as Kriemhild’s mind might be. Then Rüdiger came to the palace. Now his fellows instantly Urged him to seek decision of the mind of the noble King, And betimes to end their doubting: such was the counselling Of all; for a weary journey to their land before them lay. So into the presence of Kriemhild Rüdiger brought they. With words exceeding courteous that gallant knight drew nigh To the lady sorrow-stricken, and prayed her to make reply For the message wherewith she would charge him, to bear to the land of the Hun. But the herald with all his pleading nought but denial won:— “Never man will I love hereafter, nor another husband wed!” “Nay, Lady,” answered the Margrave, “is the word so wisely said? Wherefore to sorrow’s blasting this glory of beauty ban, When thou mayest become with honour the bride of a good true man?” {p. 171} Yet nothing availed their pleading, till Rüdiger drew near, And murmured a word in secret in the Lady Kriemhild’s ear That for all the wrongs she had suffered should requital be made unto her. Now sinketh the storm of her sorrow as the new thoughts inly stir. Yet again to the Queen he whispered: “Let be thy mourning and moan; For, though thou hadst mid the Hunfolk none save me alone, Even me and my loyal kinsmen, and my vassals stout and true, Whosoever had wronged thee, Lady, we would make him bitterly rue.” Then the face of the lady lightened, her eyes like steel flashed keen— “Swear unto me,” she answered, “whatsoever my wrong hath been, That, Rüdiger, thou wilt be foremost to avenge me with heart and hand.” Made answer to her the Margrave: “Unto this, Queen, will I stand.” For himself and for all his vassals Rüdiger sware to her then To the death evermore to serve her, and that he and his mighty men Would deny or delay her nothing afar in Etzel’s land, Whatsoever her honour demanded; and to this he gave his hand. Then thought the Faithful-hearted: “Since I thus lightly have won Friends so many and steadfast, I will e’en let folk say on What things they list of ‘the Heathen’! O sorrow-laden wife!— What and if I at last win vengeance for my lost belovèd’s life?” She thought: “Since this King Etzel is served of many a knight Over whom shall I be mistress, I may do as seemeth me right. He hath such stintless treasures, I may yet give bounteously:— All that was mine hath Hagen the ruthless torn from me!” Again unto Rüdiger spake she: “Except I had heard folk say That the King is a heathen, gladly my feet should tread the way Whither the great King biddeth, and him for my lord would I take.” “Fret not thyself, O Lady,” he answered, “for such words’ sake. (C) Not wholly is he a heathen; this know thou for very sooth. For my belovèd master was indeed baptized in his youth, Though haply he since have turned him unto ancient altar and fane. But, Lady, if thou wilt wed him, his heart may be turned yet again. {p. 172} So many good knights serve him which be thanes of Christ the Lord, That no ill may betide thee with the King, or in deed or word. And what if thine holy converse thy lord to the font should bring? Then proud wert thou and happy to be wife of Etzel the King!” Then spake unto her her brethren: “Belovèd sister, consent, And all thy tribulation shall be swallowed up in content.” So long and so instantly prayed they, that the Queen of the Sorrowful Life Pledged her at last to the heroes to be King Etzel’s wife. She spake: “I needs must yield me, a crown of sorrow who wear, With you to go to the Hunfolk when ye bid me thither to fare, If I find friends trusty and loyal to lead me hence to your land.” And thereto in the heroes’ presence fair Kriemhild gave her hand. Answered the Lord of the Marches: “Though thou have but liegemen twain, Thereto can I add full many. With all these in thy train Of a surety in safety and honour shalt thou be brought over Rhine. Lady, tarry no longer in the land that is no more thine! Knights have I here five hundred, and kinsmen, a warrior-band. Lo, these be all thy servants, both here and in Etzel’s land, Sworn to do all thy bidding. I stand by my plighted troth. I will shame mine honour never when thou biddest remember mine oath. Prepare then journeying-raiment and the trappings of the steed. As touching Rüdiger’s counsel, thou never shalt rue his rede. And bid thy maidens who journey with thee that they swiftly prepare. Many a chosen hero shall meet us as onward we fare.” Still had they the trappings and housings wherewith they wont to ride In Siegfried’s days, so that maidens many in pomp and pride Might fare in the train of Kriemhild, what time she would be gone. How goodly the jewelled saddles for those fair ladies shone! What lovely raiment soever they had e’er worn theretofore, Thereof for this wondrous journey they brought forth all their store. {p. 173} From casket and bolted coffer they drew forth vesture and gem— Such marvels of the splendour of Etzel were told unto them. Busy they were and eager till the eve of the fifth bright day. Out of the presses sought they all things therein that lay. And Kriemhild now bestirred her to unlock her treasury Of purpose to load with riches all Rüdiger’s company. Still had she somewhat remaining of the gold of the Niblung Land; And this to the Hunnish heroes would she deal with lavish hand. Scarce could a hundred horses bear thence that precious load. But some talebearer to Hagen the purpose of Kriemhild showed. “Never,” he said, “will Kriemhild forgive me that ancient wrong: Therefore the gold of Siegfried must needs here bide full long. Should I leave so mighty a treasure to my bitterest foes, and rue? Right well do I know what Kriemhild with all this wealth would do! If forth of the land she convey it, I know this certainly That with champions she will but share it, to stir up foes against me:— And she hath not so much as horses of number to bear it away! Hagen for her will keep it: to Kriemhild thus let them say.” When the thing was told unto Kriemhild, she was stung with indignant pain. Of the tyrannous wrong of Hagen to the three Kings did she complain. His will were they fain to have thwarted, but his purpose none could shake. Then Rüdiger the noble lightly to Kriemhild spake: “O high-born Daughter of Princes, wherefore lament for the gold? Unto thee is my Lord King Etzel so loving and bounteous-souled, That, soon as his eyes have beheld thee, he will give thee such rich store That never thine hands may spend it: I pledge my faith therefor.” Unto him the Queen made answer: “O noble Rüdiger, Never had Daughter of Princes such treasure bequeathed unto her As that whereof Hagen hath stripped me with neither ruth nor shame!” Then to the treasury royal her brother Gernot came: In the door did he set the great key with authority as of a king, And all the treasure of Kriemhild forth of the place did they bring, {p. 174} Marks full thirty thousand—yea, more, it may haply be— That the guests might take it; and Gunther rejoiced that deed to see. But out spake he of Bechlaren, the fair Gotlinda’s lord: “Nay, though ’neath the hand of Kriemhild lay all the treasure-hoard That ever was brought aforetime out of the Niblungs’ land, Nor I nor the Queen my Lady would touch the same with a hand. Back let them take, let them keep it; for I thereof will naught. Of mine own wealth out of my country such plenty have I brought, That of this no whit for our journey shall we need, through the land as we fare. Even we for our own wayfaring have gotten enough and to spare.” Yet had her maidens already therefrom filled coffers twelve Of gold the finest and purest that miner ever may delve. And with these they bare from the city many a precious thing, Even jewels and gems, that the maidens would wear in their journeying; —Yet still by the dread overshadowed of Hagen’s might were they;— And a thousand marks for masses yet by Kriemhild lay: For the peace of the soul of Siegfried she gave them as love’s last due. And Rüdiger thought: “This woman is faithful and loving and true.” Then spake that Lady of Sorrows: “Who love me yet so well That for me they be willing as strangers in a strange land to dwell? Who now will companion my journey, unto Etzel’s land as I ride? Let them take of my gold, and purvey them horses, and raiment provide.” Then Eckwart, Lord of the Marches, drew nigh, and thus spake he: “Since the day when I was appointed to wait, O Queen, upon thee, Faithfully and truly have I served thee,” said that thane; “Now also to my life’s ending in my fealty will I remain. Good knights withal five hundred of mine own will I take with me, And I tender to thee their service in faith and fealty. We will ever abide unsundered, except death make an end.” Low bowed her Kriemhild, and thanked him, that loving and loyal friend. {p. 175} Then led they out the horses, since forth of the land they must fare. Then brake forth bitter weeping of dear friends gathered there. There was the great Queen Uta, with many a comely maid; And they showed what burden of sorrow upon their hearts was laid. With a hundred high-born maidens she rode from the land away, All as beseemed their station attired in costly array. Ah then with tears upwelling were many bright eyes drowned: Yet many a day of joyance in Etzel’s land they found. Lord Giselher, and Gernot, with their vassal-company, Came on that parting-morning, as bidden of courtesy, To escort their belovèd sister to the uttermost part of the land, And they led a thousand warriors in that their gallant band. Came Gere the swift war-helper, came Ortwein therewithal, Nor tarried behind them Rumold, arrayer of feasts in hall[10]; And of these was prepared night-lodging for the ladies all through the way: And Volker was marshal, and hostels he found for the knights’ array. (C) When they kissed at that last leave-taking, the hot tears fell like rain Ere they won through the gates of the castle to the highway through the plain. Unbidden did many escort them afar on Burgundia’s ways: But beside them rode King Gunther from the town but a little space. Ere from the Rhine they departed, they had sent on far before Swift messengers unto Hunland that joyful tidings bore, Even to tell King Etzel that Rüdiger would bring The noble Lady Kriemhild, won to be wife to the King. (C) Swiftly the heralds onward rode; ay, well was their need, Alike for the winning of honour and the good-news’ bearer’s meed; And when they came to the home-land, and that glad word was told, Never, I ween, had Etzel been so joyful-souled. (C) In guerdon for these fair tidings Etzel the King bade give Such costly gifts to the heralds, that they might thereafter live Through all their days in joyance, yea, to the hour of their death, For afar had his trouble and anguish been driven upon love’s breath.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90347.html","bookId":422,"book":{"id":422,"title":"The Lay of the Nibelung Men","description":"简介： If we accept as our definition of an Epic:(a) A long poem, (b) of an interest not less than national[1], describing (c) in noble language (d) a series of naturally and organically connected actions (e) of heroic actors, we shall find that, while we m...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
