How they came to Bechlaren","content":"Thence hasted him the Margrave to where in the Ladies’ Bower Were sitting his wife and his daughter: unto these in the selfsame hour Told he the joyful tidings that but now had gladdened his ear, That the brethren of her Lady and Queen to their halls drew near. “Now therefore, O my belovèd,” spake Rüdiger earnestly, “Graciously shalt thou receive them, these noble princes three, When they and their train come hither as they fare unto Etzel’s court. And Hagen, Gunther’s liegeman, shalt thou greet in friendly sort. With these cometh also another, and Dankwart he hath to name, And another withal, named Volker, of knightly honour and fame. Upon these six thou and my daughter shall the greeting-kiss bestow, And the grace of courteous kindness unto all the knights shall ye show.” All this did the ladies promise, and nothing loth were they. Then sought they out of the coffers their goodliest array, That so they might greet the warriors in worthy bravery. So with eager haste they bestirred them, those ladies fair to see. {p. 226} Of false-feigned bloom of roses on their cheeks was little enow; But shining golden chaplets they bare upon each white brow Fashioned as rich-wrought garlands, that so their braided hair By the wind might not be ruffled: all dainty and fresh they were. In the labours of women busied those courtly dames leave we, The while went swiftly riding far over the river-lea Rüdiger’s friends and kinsmen, till they spied that princely band; Then heartiest welcome they gave them into the Margrave’s land. So when to the castle the Margrave beheld that company ride, How blithely hailing their presence the eager Rüdiger cried, “Welcome to me, ye princes, and all in your vassal-train! Here in mine own fair country I behold you exceeding fain.” Then bowed them to him the heroes in friendship and faith unfeigned. Well proved he with what gladness by their host were they entertained. Unto Hagen special greeting, as a friend known long agone, He gave, and withal unto Volker, Burgundia’s hero-son. Dankwart withal he greeted; then spake that valiant thane: “If thou care for us here in thy castle, who then will see to our train, Unto all the array which hath followed from Worms beyond the Rhine?” Straightway answered the Margrave: “Put by this fear of thine; For all thy vassal-companions, and what possessions soe’er Ye have brought into this my country—steeds, silver, and raiment fair— I will cause them to have such warding that nought therefrom shall be lost. By a single spur no poorer shall be any man of your host. Pitch the pavilions therefore, ye squires, on yonder lea. Whatsoe’er from your store shall be missing shall be all made good by me. Cast off the bit and bridle, and let the steeds range wide.” Never had men such welcome from any host beside! Glad were the guests when they heard it. So then when his bidding was done, And the lords rode thence to the castle, the squires all one after one Stretched them at ease on the greensward. Sweet rest at last had they: Nought like it before nor after found they in all the way. {p. 227} To the front of the castle-gateway did the noble Margravine haste With her beauteous daughter; and many a lady lovely-faced Upon this side and that was standing, and many a winsome maid In carcanet and bracelet and queenly apparel arrayed. Gleamed many a precious gemstone casting afar its sheen Forth of their costly vesture—ah, fair were they to be seen! Forward the guests came riding; from selle sprang they to the earth,— What knightly grace and courteous showed they of Burgundian birth! There were six-and-thirty maidens, and many a dame beside. Fair to all heart’s desiring were the women lovely-eyed That with many a valiant warrior to meet the strangers came: Yea, fairest greeting was tendered of noble damsel and dame. Then the Margravine welcomed the princes with the kiss of courtesy, The like did also her daughter. Now Hagen stood thereby, And her father bade her kiss him: but the maiden looked upon him, And fain would she have refrained her, for his favour was passing grim. Yet as their host her father commanded needs must she do: But came and went her colour, she was pale and red of hue. Thereafter Dankwart kissed she, and the lord of the viol-string, For his might and his valour won him the greeting due to a king. Then, to usher him into the castle, the maiden stretched her hand Unto Giselher the courteous, the Prince of Burgundia-land. And the hand of the valiant Gunther the Margravine hath ta’en. So blithely into the castle with the heroes passed these twain. The host gave hand unto Gernot: to the great hall so they came. There sat they down on the high-seats, brave knight and comely dame. Then poured they the wine of welcome, and bare to the guests all round. Never more gracious greeting have heroes-errant found! With eyes of admiration looked many a warrior there On the damsel, Rüdiger’s daughter, for the maiden was passing fair. In his heart did many a good knight her loveliness embrace: Well might they, her queenly spirit made a splendour of her face. {p. 228} Ah, they might dream as they listed!—’twas a dream no morn should fulfil! Hither and thither the glances of the heroes wandered still To the faces and forms of maidens and of dames that thronged the hall. But the heart of the noble minstrel warmed to their host above all. Then was the company sundered: the knights and the dames straightway Passed into several feast-halls, as the wont of the land was aye. In the great hall of the castle for the knights were the tables arrayed, And there to the friends from a far land was eager service paid. For a grace to her guests Burgundian the noble Margravine Sat in their midst at the table; but there was her child not seen, For apart she abode with the maidens, as the land’s wont was from of old; And the brave knights sighed for the beauty they might no longer behold. So when with the meats and the wine-cup the guests were satisfied, Back to the feast-hall led they the ladies lovely-eyed. Then a murmur of admiration and of worship from all men broke, And chiefly the valiant Volker the praise of beauty spoke; For that same viol-minstrel spake freely and openly: “O noble Lord of the Marches, God hath bestowed upon thee All gifts of his gracious bounty: he hath given to thee for wife A lady exceeding lovely, he hath crowned with bliss thy life. Now if I were the heir to a kingdom,” that viol-minstrel said, “And if I bare crown and sceptre, then would I choose to wed None other than thy fair daughter—in all sincerity I speak:—she is lovely to look on, noble and good is she.” But the Margrave spake in answer: “How might it befall, this thing, That my daughter should be the chosen and the heart’s delight of a king? Here I and my wife be homeless, nor demesne nor castle we own: No lands can we give for her portion—what availeth beauty alone?” Answered and spake to him Gernot, the royal-natured knight: “Might I choose for my bride a maiden in whom my soul should delight, Such wife as she should gladden ever mine heart and mine eyes.” Spake Hagen withal and answered in knightly-courteous wise: {p. 229} “For my young lord Giselher’s spousals a fitting time were this: And of such right noble lineage the child of the Margrave is, That with joy would we render her homage, I and his liegemen all, When crowned mid the folk Burgundian she paceth in purple and pall.” Good in the eyes of the Margrave was the word of the princes found, And sweet in the ears of Gotlind did the counsel of Hagen sound. So of one accord were the heroes that the noble Giselher Should take to wife that maiden—meet bride for a king she were! Who may withstand the issue that is doomed by fate to befall? They summoned the Margrave’s daughter to appear before them in hall: Then sware the father to give him the lovely damsel to wife, And the Prince for his part hath pledged him to cherish her all his life. To the maiden the Kings for her portion allotted castles and land; And with oaths of confirmation by the noble Gunther’s hand Was it sealed unto her, and by Gernot, that all should so be done. Then spake her father: “Albeit castles have I none, And I can but loyally prove me your friend for evermore, Yet shall my daughter’s dower be silver and gold good store So much as a hundred sumpters fully laden may bear, That his kin may with honour content them with the bride of Giselher.” Into the midst of a circle led they the plighted twain After the ancient custom. Full many a strong young thane Stood there and gazed upon them with laughter-litten eyes, Thinking such thoughts as ever in young hearts wont to rise. So then when her kin put question unto the winsome maid— “Wilt thou take this knight to thine husband?” awhile was she loth and afraid: Yet her heart within her was pleading for him, that goodly one; But for shame she hung on her answer, as many a maiden hath done. Then Rüdiger her father spake saying, “Answer yea, And gladly for husband take him.” How swiftly did he straightway With loving white hands clasping to his heart his belovèd press; Even Giselher the young prince!—how brief was their happiness! {p. 230} Then spake once more the Margrave: “O kings of lineage high, What time to the realm Burgundian returning ye pass hereby, Then will I give you my daughter, even as is meet and right, To bear her with you to the home-land.” Unto this their troth did they plight. The tumult of feasting and joyance at last must have an end; And then did the new-wed maiden to her bridal-chamber wend, And the guests through the castle rested and slept till the day shone clear. Then brake they the bread of the morning, and the host made abundant cheer. And now when the feasting was ended, they addressed them thence to go Journeying on to the Hunland—“I pray you, do not so,” Said the Margrave noble-hearted; “awhile yet tarry here. Long is it since in my castle I have harboured guests so dear.” Answered and spake to him Dankwart: “Now nay, this may not be. Whence should provision of victual and of wine be gotten of thee Enough to suffice for the feasting of so great a company?” But the host made answer: “I pray you, put all such vain words by! My lords and dearly beloved, ye may not say me nay. With meat and drink can I feast you till endeth the fourteenth day, And all that with you came hither, both lords and vassal-train. Little enow of my substance King Etzel from me hath ta’en.” How sorely soe’er they excused them, yet there perforce they abode Till dawned the fourth day’s morning. Such lavish gifts were bestowed Of their host’s free-handed bounty, that the fame thereof spread wide, How he gave to his guests rich raiment and gallant steeds to ride. No longer now might they tarry: they must needs press on to the goal. But of all his mighty possessions would Rüdiger’s princely soul Spare nought in his lavish bounty: whatsoever any might crave, Unto none he denied or begrudged it; to the heroes gladly he gave. Before the gate of the castle the squires brought harness-dight Long lines of goodly horses: then came forth many a knight Unto where the steeds stood waiting. Their shields on their arms they bare, For thence would they now be riding unto Etzel’s land to fare. {p. 231} But, or ever the high-born strangers forth of the feast-hall strode, Freely the host on the heroes the gifts of his love had bestowed. He could live wealth-crowned with honour, how largely he gave soe’er. His daughter, a gift all-priceless, had he given to Giselher; But to Gunther the peerless hero Rüdiger gave a thing That well might add new honour to the majesty of a king. Right seldom the King took presents, but he bowed him courteously As he took from the hand all-courteous the hauberk goodly to see. And a sword, a light of battle, unto Gernot the princely he gave; Ere long in the wild war-tempest mightily flashed that glaive. Smiled on him the wife of the Margrave as he took that gift from his hand. —Ah me, but her noble husband was to die by that same brand! Then, as well beseemed such a lady, unto Hagen Gotlind brought Gifts of her lovingkindness: since the King had refused them not, She prayed he would fare not forward unto Etzel’s festal-tide Unholpen of her bounty; but the hero refused, and replied: “Of all things that ever,” said Hagen, “I have seen unto this day, Nought I desire so sorely to bear with me hence away As the shield that hangeth yonder against your palace-wall: That same would I bear right gladly unto Etzel’s festival.” When heard of the wife of the Margrave was the word that Hagen spake, It wakened her sleeping sorrow: no marvel her tears outbrake! With anguish she called to remembrance the death of Nudung, her son, Whom Wittich had slain; and rekindled was the olden grief and moan. To the thane made answer the mother: “O yea, the shield will I give. Ah, would to God in Heaven that yet on the earth he might live Who bare it of old! In battle he slept the iron sleep. I must needs evermore lament him: sore cause have I to weep.” Then the noble wife of the Margrave rose up from her carven chair, And she took down the shield of the dear dead with her own white hands, and bare And gave it, her gift unto Hagen: he received in his hands the same; Ay, and he won for the buckler new glory of deathless fame! {p. 232} A cover of bright-hued loomwork enfolded its blazonries. Never hath shone the daylight on better shield than this. So richly with precious gemstones bordered was its device, That, if any were fain to buy it, a thousand marks were its price. His squires bare forth at his bidding that shield for the mighty thane. Then came his brother Dankwart before the chatelaine, And on him rich-broidered vesture did the Margrave’s daughter bestow Which thereafter he wore glad-hearted in the halls of the Hunland foe. But of all gifts Rüdiger gave them, how great soever of worth, Unto none had the haughty princes stretched a finger forth, Were it not for his courteous kindness, and the love it begat that day— Yet ere long were they foes so bitter that they needs must smite him and slay! Then Volker the battle-eager, with his viol in his hand, Stepped forth with courtly bearing before Gotlind to stand; And the sweet notes rang through the feast-hall as he chanted the lovely lay. So took he leave of the Lady ere he passed from Bechlaren away. Then the wife of the Margrave commanded that her maids unto her should bring A casket—of gifts love-sweetened now shall the minstrel sing:— Twelve armlets she took from the coffer, and she slid them over his hand: “These bear thou, Volker, I pray thee, into King Etzel’s land; And there for my sake shalt thou wear them in presence of King and thane, That folk may tell me the story, when hither thou comest again, Of the courtly service rendered unto me of Etzel’s guest.” And the bold knight did thereafter according to all her request. Then spake to his guests the Margrave: “For your safe journeying hence Myself will be your escort: so strong shall be your defence, That none shall set upon you to do you hurt by the way.” Then was his sumpter-palfrey saddled without delay. Arrayed he stood for the journey, and, furnished with raiment and steed Good knights with him five hundred; and all these thence did he lead {p. 233} Bound for the Hunfolk’s high-tide with merry hearts and light— There returned again to Bechlaren of them all no single knight! Then did their host with kisses of love from his dear wife part; With kisses was Giselher sundered from his bride; with yearning heart They held in their arms fond-clasping their wives, the passing fair. Ah, soon bewept full sorely by many a maiden they were! All through that stately castle they flung the casements wide To see the Lord of the Marches with all his men forth ride. Their hearts with mournful boding whispered to them, I trow: Wept many a winsome lady and maiden to see them go. For beloved friends and for kinsmen all these were sorrowing sore Whom the watchers should see returning to Bechlaren never more. Yet rode that company blithely down to the river-strand, And far through the Danube-valley away to the Hunfolk’s land. Then to the thanes Burgundian the princely Margrave cried, Even Rüdiger the noble: “We may now no longer hide From the lords of the realm the tidings that to Hunland we draw near. Sooth, never hath King Etzel heard aught to his heart so dear.” Then rode swift heralds many to the land of the Easterling, And so full soon did the tidings through all the country ring That from Worms-over-Rhine the heroes were coming thitherward. Welcomer news heard never the vassals of Hunland’s Lord. (C) And when to the Daughter of Princes the tidings thereof was told, From her stricken heart in a measure the burden of grief was rolled, Since now from the land of her fathers came they which had done her a wrong— Ay, they through whom King Etzel had sorrow enow ere long! Fast, fast pressed onward the heralds as the tale to the King they bare How that the Niblung chieftains nigh unto Hunland were. Kriemhild the Queen from a casement watched with eager eye For her kinsmen, as friends sore-yearning look forth as friends draw nigh. At last she beheld those thousands from the ancient home that came; And ware was the King of their coming, and he laughed with joy for the same:— {p. 234} “See to it, O dear wife, Kriemhild, thou receive them worthily. To be crowned with exceeding honour thy brethren come unto thee.” “Glad am I for these good tidings,” spake Kriemhild her heart within. “Ha, many a bright new buckler they bring, my faithless kin, And hauberks gleaming and glancing!—now whoso will take of my gold, And think on my wrongs, such champion my friend for aye will I hold.” (C) In her soul was she thinking—thinking—“The day of reckoning is this! He who hath utterly emptied my life of all its bliss Shall drink, if I may but contrive it, to the dregs the cup of pain At this guest-greeting! Ready am I and exceeding fain. (C) O yea, I will so devise it, that on this festal day My vengeance shall stand triumphant, betide thereof what may, Over his hateful body who bereaved me utterly Of love, of the joy of living—but the hour of requital is nigh!” \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90354.html","bookId":422,"book":{"id":422,"title":"The Lay of the Nibelung Men","description":"简介： If we accept as our definition of an Epic:(a) A long poem, (b) of an interest not less than national[1], describing (c) in noble language (d) a series of naturally and organically connected actions (e) of heroic actors, we shall find that, while we m...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
