A cloud of Chanel No. 5 always preceded her mom—even though she spent the whole day working around horses—and Spencer was certain she was allergic. She considered announcing her PSAT news, but a twinkly voice from the foyer stopped her. “Mom?” Melissa called. She and Wren strolled into the kitchen. Spencer pretended to study Middlemarch’s boring back cover. “Hey,” Wren said above her. “Hey,” she answered coolly. “Whatcha reading?” Spencer hesitated. It was better to steer clear of Wren, especially now that he was moving in. Melissa brushed by without saying hello and began to unpack purple pillows from a Pottery Barn bag. “These are for the couch in the barn,” she practically yelled. Spencer cringed. Two could play at this game. “Oh, Melissa!” Spencer cried. “I forgot to tell you! Guess who I ran into!” Melissa continued to unpack the pillows. “Who?” “Ian Thomas! He’s coaching my field hockey team now!” Melissa froze. “He…what? He is? He’s here? Did he ask about me?” Spencer shrugged and pretended to think. “No, I don’t think so.” “Who’s Ian Thomas?” Wren asked, leaning against the marble island counter. “No one,” Melissa snapped, turning back to the pillows. Spencer slapped her book shut and skipped off to the dining room. There. That felt better. She sat down at the long, mission-style farmhouse table, running her finger around the stemless wineglass Candace, the family’s housekeeper, had just filled with red wine. Her parents didn’t care if their kids drank while they were at home as long as no one was driving, so she grabbed the glass with both hands and greedily took a large gulp. When she looked up, Wren was smirking at her from across the table, his spine very straight in his dining chair. “Hey,” he said. She raised her eyebrows in answer. Melissa and Mrs. Hastings sat down, and Spencer’s father adjusted the chandelier lights and took a seat as well. For a moment everyone was quiet. Spencer felt for the PSAT score papers in her pocket. “So guess what happened to me,” she began. “Wren and I are so happy you’re letting us stay here!” Melissa said at the same time, grabbing Wren’s hand. Mrs. Hastings smiled at Melissa. “I’m always happy when the family’s all here.” Spencer bit her lip, her stomach nervously gurgling. “So, Dad. I got my—” “Uh-oh,” Melissa interrupted, staring down at the plates Candace had just brought in from the kitchen. “Do we have anything other than chicken? Wren’s trying not to eat meat.” “It’s all right,” Wren said hastily. “Chicken is perfect.” “Oh!” Mrs. Hastings stood up halfway. “You don’t eat meat? I didn’t know! I think we may have some pasta salad in the fridge, although it might have ham in it….” “Really, it’s okay.” Wren rubbed his head uncomfortably, making his messy black hair stand up in peaks. “Oh, I feel terrible,” Mrs. Hastings said. Spencer rolled her eyes. When the whole family was together, her mom wanted all meals—even sloppy cereal breakfasts—to be perfect. Mr. Hastings eyed Wren suspiciously. “I’m a steak man, myself.” “Absolutely.” Wren lifted his glass so forcefully that a little wine spilled on the tablecloth. Spencer was considering a good segue into her big announcement when her father laid down his fork. “I’ve got a brilliant idea. Since we’re all here, why don’t we play Star Power?” “Oh, Daddy.” Melissa grinned. “No.” Her father smiled. “Oh yes. I had a terrific day at work. I’m going to kick your butt.” “What’s Star Power?” Wren asked, his eyebrows arched. A nervous glow grew in Spencer’s stomach. Star Power was a game her parents had made up when Spencer and Melissa were little kids that she’d always suspected they’d pilfered from some company power-retreat. It was simple: Everyone shared their biggest achievement of the day, and the family would select one Star. It was supposed to make people feel proud and accomplished, but in the Hastings family, people just got ruthlessly competitive. But if there was one perfect way for Spencer to announce her PSAT results, Star Power was it. “You’ll catch on, Wren,” Mr. Hastings said. “I’ll start. Today, I prepared a defense so compelling for my client, he actually offered to pay me more money.” “Impressive,” her mother said, taking a tiny bite of a golden beet. “Now me. This morning, I beat Eloise at tennis in straight sets.” “Eloise is tough!” her father cried before taking another sip of wine. Spencer peeked at Wren across the table. He was carefully peeling the skin off his chicken thigh, so she couldn’t catch his eye. Her mother dabbed her mouth with her napkin. “Melissa?” Melissa laced her stubby-nailed fingers together. “Well, hmm. I helped the builders tile the entire bathroom—the only way it’d be perfect is if I did it myself.” “Good for you, dear!” her father said. Spencer jiggled her legs nervously. Mr. Hastings finished sipping his wine. “Wren?” Wren looked up, startled. “Yes?” “It’s your turn.” Wren fiddled with his wineglass. “I don’t know what I should say….” “We’re playing Star Power,” Mrs. Hastings chirped, as if Star Power were as common a game as Scrabble. “What wonderful thing did you, Mr. Doctor, achieve today?” “Oh.” Wren blinked. “Well. Um, nothing, really. It was my day off from school and the hospital, so I went down to the pub with some hospital friends and watched the Phillies game.” Silence. Melissa shot Wren a disappointed look. “I think that’s awesome,” Spencer offered. “The way they’ve been playing, it’s a feat to watch the Phillies all day.” “I know, they’re kind of crap, aren’t they?” Wren smiled at her gratefully. “Well, anyway,” her mother interrupted. “Melissa, when do you start class?” “Wait a minute,” Spencer piped up. They were not about to forget her! “I have something for Star Power.” Her mother’s salad fork hung in the air. “I’m sorry.” “Oops!” her father agreed jocularly. “Go ahead, Spence.” “I got my PSAT results,” she said. “And, well…here.” She pulled out the scores and shoved them at her father. As soon as he took them, she knew what would happen. They wouldn’t care. What did PSATs matter, anyway? They’d go back to their Beaujolais and to Melissa and Wharton and that would be that. Her cheeks felt hot. Why did she even bother? Then her dad put down his wineglass and studied the paper. “Wow.” He motioned Mrs. Hastings over. When she saw the paper, she gasped. “You can’t get much higher than this, can you?” Mrs. Hastings said. Melissa craned her neck to look too. Spencer could hardly breathe. Melissa glared at her over the lilac and peony centerpiece. It was a look that made Spencer think that maybe Melissa had written that creepy e-mail yesterday. But when Spencer met her eye, Melissa broke into a smile. “You really studied, didn’t you?” “It’s a good score, yeah?” Wren asked, glancing at the page. “It’s a fantastic score!” Mr. Hastings bellowed. “This is wonderful!” cried Mrs. Hastings. “How would you like to celebrate, Spencer? Dinner in the city? Is there something you’ve had your eye on?” “When I got my SAT scores, you got me a Fitzgerald first edition at that estate auction, remember?” Melissa beamed. “That’s right!” Mrs. Hastings trilled. Melissa turned to Wren. “You would’ve loved it. It was so amazing to bid.” “Well, why don’t you give it some thought.” Mrs. Hastings said to Spencer. “Try to think of something memorable, like what we got for Melissa.” Spencer slowly sat up. “Actually, there is something that I have in mind.” “What’s that?” Her father leaned forward in his chair. Here goes, Spencer thought. “Well, what I’d really, really, really love, right now, not a few months from now, would be to move into the barn.” “But—,” Melissa started, before stopping herself. Wren cleared his throat. Her father furrowed his brow. Spencer’s stomach made a loud, hungry growl. She covered it with her hand. “Is that what you really want?” her mother asked. “Uh-huh,” Spencer answered. “Okay,” Mrs. Hastings said, looking at her husband. “Well…” Melissa loudly laid down her fork. “But, um, what about Wren and me?” “Well, you said yourself the renovations wouldn’t take too long.” Mrs. Hastings put her hand to her chin. “You guys could stay in your old bedroom, I suppose.” “But it has a twin bed,” Melissa said in an uncharacteristically childish voice. “I don’t mind,” Wren said quickly. Melissa scowled sharply at him. “We could move the queen bed from the barn to Melissa’s room and put Spencer’s bed out there,” Mr. Hastings suggested. Spencer couldn’t believe her ears. “You would do that?” Mrs. Hastings raised her eyebrows. “Melissa, you can survive, can’t you?” Melissa pushed her hair back from her face. “I guess,” she said. “I mean, I personally got much more out of the auction and the first edition, but that’s just me.” Wren discreetly took a sip of his wine. When Spencer caught his eye, he winked. Mr. Hastings turned to Spencer. “Done, then.” Spencer jumped up and hugged her parents. “Thank you, thank you, thank you!” Her mother beamed. “You should move in tomorrow.” “Spencer, you’re certainly the Star.” Her father held up her scores, now slightly stained with red wine. “We should frame this as a memento!” Spencer grinned. She didn’t need to frame anything. She’d remember this day for as long as she lived. 13 ACT ONE: GIRL MAKES BOY WANT HER “Want to come with me to an artist reception at the Chester Springs studio next Monday night?” Aria’s mother, Ella, asked. It was Thursday morning, and Ella was sitting across from Aria at the breakfast table, doing the New York Times crossword puzzle with a leaky black pen and eating a bowl of Cheerios. She had just returned to her part-time job at the Davis contemporary art gallery on Rosewood’s main drag, and she was on the mailing list for all the benefits. “Isn’t Dad going to go with you?” Aria asked. Her mom pursed her lips together. “He has a lot of work to do for his classes.” “Oh.” Aria picked at a loose strand of wool on the fingerless gloves she’d knitted during a long train ride to Greece. Was that suspicion she detected in her mom’s voice? Aria always worried Ella would find out about Meredith and never forgive her for keeping the secret.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-little-liars-pretty-little-liars-1/page-15.html","bookId":2378,"book":{"id":2378,"title":"Pretty Little Liars (Pretty Little Liars #1)","description":"Storyline: Pretty Little Liars (Pretty Little Liars #1) Three years ago, Alison disappeared after a slumber party, not to be seen since.
