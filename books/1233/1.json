{"id":19389,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. AWAITING THE TRAVELLER.","content":"With all the pomp and ceremony that should accompany the dying hours of a great lady of France, the Princesse de Rochebazon--Marquise du Gast d\u0027An?illy, Comtesse de Montrachet, Baronne de Beauvilliers, and possessor of many other titles, as well as the right to the tabouret--drew near her end. \\n\\n \\n\\n A great lady of France, yet a woman against whom scandal had never breathed a word; a woman whose name had never been coupled with that of any courtier in a manner disadvantageous to her fame, but who instead, since first she came into the family a bride, had always been spoken highly of. As a saint by some--nay, by many; as a Christian by all; as a good servant of the Church. Now, the priests said, she was about to reap her reward in another existence, where her exalted rank would count as nothing and the good deeds of her life as everything. \\n\\n \\n\\n Below, in the courtyard of her great hotel--which was situated in the Rue Champfleury, still called by many La Rue Honteuse because of what had gone on in that street hundreds of years before--the huge Suisse stood at the open gateway, leaning on his silver-headed cane, which he no longer dared to thump vigorously on the ground for fear of disturbing his dying mistress, stood and gazed forth into the long though narrow street. Perhaps to see that none intruded within the crimson cord set in front of the porte-cochère of the H?tel de Rochebazon; perhaps to observe--with that pride which the menial takes in the greatness of his employers--how all the noble and illustrious callers on his mistress had to leave their coaches and their chairs outside of that barrier, and advance on foot for some yards along the filthy chaussée ere they could enter the courtyard; also, perhaps, to tell himself, with a warm glow of satisfaction, that none below royalty who had ever approached their end in Paris had been inquired after by more illustrious visitors. \\n\\n \\n\\n Above, in the room where the princess lay dying--yet with all her faculties about her, and with, though maybe she hardly thought so, a great deal of vitality still left in her body--everything presented the appearance of belonging to one of wealth and position. The apartment was the bed chamber in which none but the chiefs of the house of de Rochebazon were ever permitted to lie; the bed, of great splendour and vast antiquity, was the bed in which countless de Beauvilliers and Montrachets and du Gast d\u0027An?illys and de Rochebazons had been born and died. A bed with a ruelle around it as handsome in its velvet and gold lace and gilt pilasters as the ruelle of Le Dieudonné himself--for the de Rochebazons assumed, and were allowed to assume without protest, many of the royal attributes and peculiarities--a bed standing upon a raised platform, or rostrum, as though the parquet floor was not exalted enough to come into contact with the legs of the couch on which the rulers of the house stretched their illustrious limbs. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the room itself all was done that could be done to make it a fitting apartment for those heads of this great family. Arras and tapestry hung on the walls, representing religious scenes, battle scenes, hawking and hunting scenes; upon the uncovered portions of the wainscot were paintings of members who had borne at different times the different names of the family; on plaques in other places were miniatures and pictures by Bordier and Petitot, Mignard and Le Brun. Also, although \u0027twas autumn now, all about the great chamber were placed bowls of flowers and ferns and grasses. These brightened not only the room, but sweetened it as well, and mingled their pure perfume with the less pure Pulvilio and Bouquet du Roi with which the air was impregnated. \\n\\n \\n\\n In silvery tones a masterpiece of Fromantil\u0027s struck far down the room, over the mantelshelf of the huge fireplace, by the side of which a monk sat reading his breviary, and as it did so the princess, lying on her bed, opened her eyes--large, blue-gray eyes, the brightness of which age had no power to quench, nor would have till she was dead--and spoke to a girl seated outside the ruelle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What hour was that, Manon? Three or four?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Three, Madame la Princesse,\" the other answered, rising and passing under the bar to her mistress. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The day is fair,\" the dying aristocrat said, letting her eyes glance toward the windows, through the heavy lace curtains of which the sun\u0027s rays strayed. \"Fair. There is nothing to impede his journey. He should be here to-night. He must have crossed from England yesterday, must he not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should suppose so, madame. This is Friday. Your courier left for London last Sunday. It is certain Monsieur Ashurst must be very near Paris now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, Manon! Monsieur Ashurst! Monsieur Ashurst! I would, instead, he were Monsieur de Beauvilliers. Then--then----\" She broke off in what she had been about to say and bade the girl go tell the holy father he might leave the room, might walk in the garden if he chose, and see if there were any roses left. His services were not now required; if she could judge by her feelings, her death was not to be yet. Send him away, she gave order. \\n\\n \\n\\n Obedient to her commands--was she not a patroness of all the religious foundations in and around Paris, as well as a magnificent benefactress?--the monk departed. Then the Princesse de Rochebazon continued: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If he were not Monsieur Ashurst, but were instead of my husband\u0027s side, the de Rochebazons would not have come to an end--to an end. My God! why is he not a de Beauvilliers? Yet, had he been, I might not have loved him as I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tis pity, madame,\" the girl said. \"Yet even as it is----\" then paused, breaking off. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Even as it is,\u0027 you would say, \u0027he will inherit much--much of the de Rochebazon fortune.\u0027 Yes, \u0027tis true. He will be well provided for. After the Church--that first. Also you, Manon, are remembered.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame!\" the girl exclaimed softly, gratefully. Then went on, while as she spoke the tears stood in her eyes. \"You have been always very good to me, oh! so good, so good, as ever and to all. What shall we do? What shall we do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay, weep not. And--and--\u0027Good!\u0027 Never say that. I----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A tap, gentle as became the sick room, was heard at the door, whereupon the girl, drying her eyes, went down to where it opened, and after a whispered word with some domestic outside, returned to the bed and, standing outside the ruelle, said, \"Madame is here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Again! To-day! She is very thoughtful. Let her be brought to me at once. And, Manon, we will be alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Madame la Princesse,\" whereupon, bowing, she left her mistress, going once more toward the door, at which she waited until steps were heard outside, when she opened it wide and courtesied lowly and reverently before the woman who had been spoken of as \"Madame,\" and who now came in. \\n\\n \\n\\n A lady well advanced in years, having the appearance of being about seventy, yet looking almost more, since the sumptuous black in which she was arrayed seemed by its fashion to be suitable to an older woman than even she was--a lady stately enough, though not tall, with a white complexion and worn features, eyes that were piercing though not dark, a mouth in which there were few teeth left, those that still remained being black and discoloured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aurore,\" she said, advancing to the bedside and passing within the ruelle, a bar of which had been lifted by the attendant ere she went out, \"Aurore, I thank our Heavenly Father that he has not yet thought fit to take you to himself. I--I--was very desirous of seeing you again before we meet in Heaven--as I pray we shall ere long.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame,\" the princess said, her voice calm and, for one reaching her end, marvellously clear and distinct, \"to see you must always be a gratification to me, even in my extremity. Madame----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cease this form of address,\" the other said, seating herself as she did so in a low chair by the side of the great bed. \"There is no necessity for ceremony. We have always been friends, going hand in hand in God\u0027s work since--long ago--since you were wife to the Baron de Beauvilliers and with a greater position still to come; since I was Madame Scarron only, with little thought of ever being a----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Queen!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay! Never that. A king\u0027s wife--but no queen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It rested with you. The acknowledgment might have been forthcoming had you desired it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Even so. Only it was best to--to--let matters remain as they are.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So far as one so feeble as the princess now was could do so, she bent her head acquiescingly; doubtless she knew also that it was best that this woman should never be an acknowledged queen. She had not been a brilliant figure of the court of France for fifty years without being aware of all that was said, all that was whispered of Fran?oise d\u0027Aubigné ere she found religion--as well as favour in the eyes of the king! Also, all that was whispered after that favour was found. There were a thousand tongues for ever wagging, as well as innumerable pens--the pen of De Sevignés to hint, the pens of Rabutins and Tallement des Réaux to speak plainly. Also her first lover was remembered and spoken of with many a courtier\u0027s tongue thrust in his, or her, cheek. \\n\\n \\n\\n But now--now! she posed as God\u0027s vicegerent in France. Religion, even God himself, as some said bitterly, had been taken under her patronage; the king trembled for his soul as she worked on the fears of his mind, and Jansenists, Calvinists, Huguenots had been driven forth by hundreds of thousands to other lands, or, remaining in France, had been dragooned, sent to the galleys, the wheel, and the flames. The \"femme fameuse et funeste\" was the greatest living saint in Europe. \\n\\n \\n\\n And as a saint, a patroness of the Holy Roman Church, she came now to visit the Princesse de Rochebazon once more ere she died. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aurore,\" she said, a moment later, \"I have come to you again, hoping to find you not yet gone before me; because--because--oh, Aurore! to--to plead once more for the sacred cause of our Church; to beseech you to consider what you are about to do. Think! Think! You have worked so much good for that Church--yet you may do more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"More!\" the dying woman said, her clear, bright eyes fixed full blaze upon the other. \"Madame--well, Fran?oise, since you insist--what more can I do? There is no de Rochebazon succeeding to title or estate, the power to will the latter, and--and all the movables, the argent comptant, is mine. And it is done. Beyond a few gifts to those who have served me, beyond what I have saved from that which is not justly mine, the Church will have all--all! Can it demand further?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tis that, \u0027tis that, Aurore! What you have saved from that which is most justly yours? \u0027Tis that! You told me,\" and now her voice, never loud, sank almost to a whisper, as though she feared that even in this vast room there might still be some who could overhear her, \"that to this young man, this Martin Ashurst--this Anglais--you have left those savings. A noble heritage, five hundred thousand pistoles. Oh, Aurore! Aurore! think, think! it is French money, and he is--English----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is my own flesh and blood,\" the other interjected. \"My brother\u0027s child! And he is of our Church!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That alone redeems it. Yet think of all our Church, here in this France of ours, needs. Money to extirpate the heretics--some can even be bought with money, they say; in the Midi there are those who will adopt our religion for a handful of Louis d\u0027ors----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They must have changed since their grandfather\u0027s days!--since La Rochelle!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They have changed, though--Vengeance confound and crush them!--some are still obstinate. But, Aurore, listen. This young man, this nephew, needs not the money. He is provided for, will be provided for in his own land. He will do well--go far under the heretic, Anne. Oh, Aurore, he is your flesh and blood, I know. \u0027Tis but nature that you should benefit him--yet not so much, not so much. God is before man--before all earthly relations.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is my brother\u0027s child,\" the Princesse de Rochebazon repeated. \"And I loved that brother. Also this one has been my care----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know, I know! Supported, educated by you, given money hourly to squander in waste. Yet I speak not against that; he is of your race. But now you will give him all this--so great a sum! And France needs money. Aurore,\" she cried, \"do you know that our--that Louis\u0027--coffers are empty? The wars, the buildings, the pomps and vanities, the awful prodigalities of the court have left those coffers bare. And money is needed so, needed so--especially for the work of the Church--needed so much!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And she almost wrung her hands as thus she pleaded. Yet again the dying aristocrat murmured: \"My own flesh and blood. Also of our faith.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Exhausted by her own efforts, the De Maintenon--the Curse of France! as many had termed her--seemed now to desist, to be beaten back by the words of the princess. Then suddenly seemed also roused to fresh excitement as the other spoke again--excitement mixed this time with anger, as testified by the glances her eyes shot forth. For the dying woman had continued: \"Though I provide for him I must tell him the truth--tell all. I can not die with a lie on my lips--in my heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aurore!\" she exclaimed--had she not been a king\u0027s wife, had this not been a sick-room, it might almost have seemed that she screamed at the other--\"Aurore, your brain is gone. You are mad. Tell him all, and lead to further evil to our Church. Aurore, for God\u0027s sake say this is a fantasy of your mind. Why,\" she exclaimed, her passion mounting with her thoughts, \"why should you, a stranger to France, a woman raised by marriage to your high position, bring scandal on the name of a noble family--reveal secrets that have slumbered for years?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can not die,\" the other repeated, \"with the truth hidden.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The truth,\" Madame de Maintenon muttered through her discoloured teeth, \"the truth! What has the truth to do with--what account is it when set against our faith! Aurore, in the name of that faith, recall your words, your resolve.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But the dying woman was unshaken. Even the other, whose influence terrified all France, could not affright her--perhaps because the princess knew that henceforth she had to answer to a greater than she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must confess it to him--I must--I must!\" she murmured faintly. \"I must. I can not die with such a secret in my heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1617/47853.html","bookId":1233,"book":{"id":1233,"title":"The Scourge of God","description":"简介： With all the pomp and ceremony that should accompany the dying hours of a great lady of France, the Princesse de Rochebazon--Marquise du Gast d\u0027An?illy, Comtesse de Montrachet, Baronne de Beauvilliers, and possessor of many other titles, as well as t...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1617","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:40 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:40 AM"}}
