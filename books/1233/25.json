Entered by the Porte des Carmes, to find himself in the midst of a seething mass of people who shouted and gesticulated while pushing each other to and fro, some doing so in their anxiety to escape from out the city, others endeavouring to force themselves farther into it and toward the Canal de la Gau, which was near the gate. A mass of people who seemed infuriated, beyond the bounds of reason, to frenzy, who shouted and screamed, \"Au glaive, au glaive avec les héritéques. Kill all! Burn all! Now is the time.\" While others shrieked, \"To the mill, to the mill!\" as onward they went in the direction of the canal. He had put his horse up in a stall behind the gate, tethering it to a peg alongside one or two other animals which, by their trappings, evidently belonged to some dragoons; and now, borne on by the crowd, Martin went the same way, keeping his feet with difficulty yet still progressing, progressing toward where he saw the flames ascending, darting through dense masses of black smoke, roaring as a vast furnace roars. Toward the mill that, all said, was the place which was on fire; the mill in which there were three hundred people--women, children, and old, decrepit, useless men, old, aged Protestants who could not take to the mountains--being burned to death; the mill in which they had been worshipping God in their own fashion. \"Tell me,\" Martin besought a bystander, big, brawny, and muscular, whom he found by his side and who, in spite of his splendidly developed manhood, wept, dashing the tears fiercely away from his eyes every moment. \"Tell me what has happened. Tell me, I beg you.\" \"Murder! Butchery! A crime that will ring down the ages. Montrevel is burning three hundred helpless ones in Mercier\u0027s mill.\" Then he paused, casting his eyes over Martin\u0027s riding dress (stained now with the dust of his long rides) and upon his lace at breast and throat, smirched and dirty from continued wear. Paused to say: \"What are you? a seigneur, I see. But of which side? The butchers or the slaughtered?\" \"I am of the Reformed faith.\" \"Of N?mes?\" the man asked. \"If so, God help you. Your mother or your babe may be burning there and you powerless to succour them. Montrevel\u0027s wolves surround the mill. He is there too, mad with wine and lust of blood. If there is any woman or child you love in N?mes at this moment, God help you.\" \"She whom I love is not here. But, alas! can we do nothing? You wear a sword as I do? We can strike a blow----\" \"Do! What can we do? There are two hundred dragoons there. What will our blades avail, though we were the best ferrailleurs in France?\" Then suddenly he cried, \"See, there is the slaughter-house!\" He spoke truly. The burning mill was before them. A sight to freeze one\u0027s blood, to turn that blood to ice even beneath the sky of brass, even before the hot flames that darted forth, licking up, devouring all. It stood, an ancient building of stone foundations and wooden superstructure. They said the former dated back to C?sar\u0027s day, the latter to that of Charles le Bel, upon the banks of the canal as it would never stand again, since now it was nothing but a mass of burning fuel. Also a human hecatomb, there being within it the ashes of three hundred human beings whose bodies had that morning been consumed. And Martin blessed God that he had not been there to hear their piercing shrieks, their cries for mercy and their supplications. Around the nearly destroyed mill, except on one side where it adjoined an inn, \"La Rose de Provence,\" the front of which was all singed and scarred, he saw the executioners, the men who had been soldiers, fierce yet valiant, until this morning, but who were now worthy of no nobler name than that of cowardly murderers. Dragoons, Croatian Cravates, now Prance\u0027s most bloody swashbucklers with one exception, the Miquelets, those fierce Pyrenean tigers, as well as chevaux-légers and countless numbers of the milice. And near them, his sword drawn, his face inflamed with drink and fury, his breast a mass of ribbons and orders, was Montrevel upon his horse, a scandal to the baton he had lately gained. \"Murderer! Assassin! Brave butcher of women and babes,\" howled many in the crowd, one half of which was Protestant, \"noble papist! you have done your work well. Yet beware of Cavalier and Roland!\" And even as they so shouted, from more than one window high up in the roofs there came little puffs of smoke and spits of flame, showing that he was aimed at. Only the devil protected him. His time was not yet come. He was mad now with fury or drink, or thirst for human blood. Mad, stung to frenzy by resistance and contempt, even in spite of all that he had done that morning, of having glutted his ire on the helpless, which should have sufficed, all heard him roar: \"Finissons! N?mes is heretic to the core. Make an end of it. Avancez, mes soldats. Burn, destroy, slaughter. Kill all.\" And he turned his horse toward where the crowd was thickest and bade the carnage begin, marshalling his troops into companies the better to distribute them about the doomed city. But now there stepped forth one--Sandricourt, Governor of N?mes--who forbade him to do that which he threatened; warned him that if one more house or street was injured he would himself that night set forth for Paris, and tell Louis that Montrevel was unworthy of the command he held in this distracted province. \"Ha! Sandricourt, \u0027tis Sandricourt,\" whispered one in a knot of Protestants standing near to where Martin and the man he had accosted were. \"He is the best, he and Fléchier, bishop though he is. If all were like them--if Baville were--then--then we might live in peace, not see nor know the awful terrors we have seen this day. Oh, the horror of it! the horror of it!\" and he buried his face in his hands as though to hide some sight that he feared might blast him. Baville! The name recalled the man to Martin\u0027s memory. Nay, it did more, far more than that. Recalled his love, Urbaine. Set him wondering, too, if by any chance this holocaust had taken place at the Intendant\u0027s suggestion; if this was a vengeance on those who had destroyed her. For he must deem her dead by now; weeks had passed since she disappeared. Had he set the shambles fresh running with blood to avenge her loss? He must see Baville at once, must tell him she was safe. Thereby, perhaps, more slaughter might be averted. \"Where is Baville?\" he asked, turning to the group of terrified Protestants by his side. \"Is he in this carnage?\" \"God, he knows,\" one replied. \"Yet he has not appeared. Not since this commenced. Were you here at the beginning?\" \"Nay, I arrived but now. Is it true, can it be true there are three hundred destroyed within that?\" and he glanced toward the débris of the mill, the superstructure now nothing but ashes and charred beams, with, lying above them, the red tiles of what had been a roof ere it fell in, burying beneath it--what? \"It is true, it is true,\" the man wailed. Then, composing himself, he told of all that had gone before. \"They were at prayer,\" he said, \"in there, in Mercier\u0027s mill. I myself and Prosper Roumilli,\" indicating one of the men by his side. \"Also Antoine La Quoite and Pierre Delamer,\" nodding to two others near him, \"were hastening to join them; all grieved that we were too late. Late, grand Dieu! What have we not escaped?\" \"Death and destruction,\" whispered La Quoite, trembling. \"Ay, death and destruction. Hélas! they raised their songs of thanksgiving too loud. Their cantiques told where they were, reached the ears of that murderer there who was at his breakfast----\" \"He was,\" again interrupted La Quoite, \"with the woman, Léonie Sabbat. A fitting companion. She can drink even him beneath the table.\" \"Furious he left that table, summoned a battalion, passed swiftly here, surrounded the mill. Furious, too, because as they passed the cathedral he heard the organ blow, knew that Fléchier worshipped too, mad and savage because during such time we should also worship God in our own way.\" \"Yet our day will come,\" murmured Pierre Delamer, \"it will come. I am old, yet shall I not die until it comes.\" \"The soldiers burst open the door,\" went on the original speaker, \"rushed in among them sabres in hand, slew many. Yet this was too slow for him----\" \"It was,\" exclaimed La Quoite. \"He said they would be three hundred minutes slaying three hundred people thus. Too slow! He drew off his men, closed the doors, set fire to the mill. You see the end,\" and he pointed to the ashes of the ruined place, ashes that were also something else besides the remains of the mill. Again the first speaker took up the story, Martin feeling sick unto death as he stood by and heard. \"From within there came the shouts of the lost, the piercing cries, the heartrending shrieks. Midst burst walls, at windows, upon the roof, we saw the death-doomed appear. Flying spectres, phantoms, upon them the wounds the soldiers had made, black, singed by the flames. And then, O God! the sight passed man\u0027s endurance.\" \"What next?\" asked Martin, white to the lips. \"What next? This: With their new weapons, the accursed ba?onnettes, the soldiers thrust back into the flames those whom the could get at; those whom they could not reach they fired at. We saw them fall back shrieking. Yet in God\u0027s mercy their shrieks ceased soon--there were none left.\" \"But one,\" exclaimed the man called La Quoite, \"a girl, pauvre petite fillette! She escaped so far as to reach the ground unhurt, to escape their blades, although they held them up as she jumped from the window, so that thereby she might be impaled. But they missed her, and, running toward Montrevel, she shrieked for mercy. Poor child, poor child! not more than fifteen--than fifteen!\" \"His lackey,\" struck in Delamer, \"had more mercy than the master. He helped her to escape from out the hands of the soldiers.\" \"Thank God there was a man, a human heart, among them,\" murmured Martin. \"Ay, yet it availed little. The brigand ordered her to the hangman\u0027s hands, also the lackey. The gibbet was prepared. Both would have died but that a Catholic woman, une s?ur de la miséricorde, upon her knees--Heaven\u0027s blessings light upon her!--besought him by the God whom all worship equally to give them their lives.\" \"And he yielded?\" \"He yielded. He spared these two, though an hour later the lackey was thrown outside the gate of N?mes, his master bidding him go hang or drown himself, or join his friends, les Protestants, whereby once more he might fall into his hands.\" \"There is one good piece of news yet to be told,\" whispered La Quoite, who was a man of fiercer mood than the others. \"In the mêlée the soldiers sabred many of the Catholics unwittingly. God be praised!\" and he laughed harshly. And now the end of this day\u0027s work had come. Montrevel had left the spot. Behind him went the dragoons and milices. The butchery was over. He should have been well satisfied with his morning. Yet it scarcely looked as though he were so. His eyes glared around him as he rode off, his hand clutched convulsively the sword laid across his horse\u0027s mane. No wonder that they said afterward, when his recall came and the noble and merciful Villars replaced him, that on that day he was mad as the long-chained and infuriated panther is mad. He had met with nothing but defeat and disaster since he had marched into Languedoc tambours battants; nothing but scorn and contempt and derision from the mountaineers whom he had sworn to crush beneath his heel; had received nothing but reproof from headquarters. \"Baville must be somewhere near,\" Martin said to La Quoite as they watched him ride forth from the scene of carnage. \"Where is he?\" \"I know not; yet, doubtless, not far. And he too is mad for the death of his loved one. God grant he is not close at hand; that none of us fall into his clutches. He would spur Montrevel on to fresh attempts.\" Yet La Quoite\u0027s prayer found no echo in Martin\u0027s heart. He wished to find Baville, desired to see him, to stand face to face with him and tell him that Urbaine was safe. For safe she must be even after this massacre, safe even though in Cavalier\u0027s hands. Had he not said that he knew for certain she too was a Protestant, as they were--une Huguenote! Note.--Justice requires it to be said that, of all the Roman Catholic writers who have described and written upon the slaughter at the mill in N?mes, not one has approved of it, or attempted to exonerate Montrevel. In truth, this awful outrage was the brutality of a rude, ungovernable soldier and not of a priest; and Fléchier, Bishop of N?mes, was loud in its condemnation. It led to Montrevel\u0027s recall and to the arrival of Marshal Villars, who at last restored peace to Languedoc by the use of clemency and mercy. Such peace was not, however, to take place for some time. Also it should be stated that Baville was quite free from any part in this matter, and that Louis XIV knew nothing of what had happened, nor indeed of any of the terrible events which occurred about the same time, it being the system of Madame de Maintenon and of Chamillart to keep him in ignorance of what was being enacted so far away from Versailles. It has been told that when he heard of the massacre at the mill he was observed to weep for the first and only time in his life. He might well do so!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1617/47886.html","bookId":1233,"book":{"id":1233,"title":"The Scourge of God","description":"简介： With all the pomp and ceremony that should accompany the dying hours of a great lady of France, the Princesse de Rochebazon--Marquise du Gast d\u0027An?illy, Comtesse de Montrachet, Baronne de Beauvilliers, and possessor of many other titles, as well as t...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1617","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:40 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:40 AM"}}
