{"id":19400,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII.","content":"\"I AM A PROTESTANT.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n An hour later the meeting in the H?tel de Ville had broken up, yet not before Buscarlet had said words such as he had better have bitten out his tongue than have uttered; for, after he had told his tale truthfully (as nothing would have prevented him from telling it) and had described all that had taken place from the moment when, singing their psalms, the men of the mountains had passed down the village street, bidding all the inhabitants keep within doors--narrating, too, how he had besought them to spare the abbé and return good for evil--the Intendant had remarked almost angrily to him: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yet, in spite of all you say, the rebellion against the king\u0027s authority, the murder, and all other violence has happened, as it always happens, in a place of strong heretical leanings. Oh, you Protestants, as you term yourselves; oh, you of the Reformed faith, as you blasphemously name yourselves--ever are you at the root of all rebellion, of all eruption, all attacks upon those who are God\u0027s anointed. Yet you can never triumph. Never--here in France.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As he spoke he revealed to those around him what were his true feelings in regard to all that had taken place, though indeed some of them knew or suspected those feelings; revealed that it was the resistance to the king\u0027s power, the constituted authority, which he was determined to crush more than the resistance to the ancient and, in this place at least, cruel faith of the land. These were indeed his feelings, this his guiding motive. He was above all things a courtier, a king\u0027s man; and though for thirty-three years he never quitted Languedoc for a single day, he becoming its Intendant in 1685 and retiring from it in 1718, Versailles with its powerful master was the star on which his eyes were ever fixed. Nay, he himself had said that Le roi était son Dieu, and that to do him service was all he lived for. As for the outraged Romish faith, let Rome repay that outrage. His duty was to crush rebellion, and he did it well. When he finally left the province, he had caused twelve thousand Protestants to suffer either death, imprisonment, or transportation to the galleys. \\n\\n \\n\\n But now from Buscarlet there came a denial of Baville\u0027s charges against his creed. Rising from his seat by Martin\u0027s side he spoke, while all in the room gazed in astonishment at the old man, never expecting to hear the words he uttered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your Excellency,\" he said, \"have you weighed well your words ere you uttered them? Scarcely, I think. All rebellion comes from us, the Protestants, you have said, all attack upon those who are God\u0027s anointed. Is this so? Pause, sir, and reflect. Who was it who first uttered the maxim that bad kings should be deposed? Who were those whom Henri of Valois saw force their way into his palace of the Louvre, carry off his furniture, reverse his arms, destroy his portrait, break his great seal, style him Lache, Hérétique, Tyran? Was it not the Sorbonne who declared the people absolved from their vow to him, erased his name from the prayers of the Romish Church? Who slew him at St. Cloud? Jacques Clement, the monk--was he a Protestant?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Henri de Valois was himself a murderer,\" the bishop made answer. \"Himself slew the Guises at Blois.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How many Protestants have been murdered by orders of our present king? Yet there is not one in France who would raise his hand against him,\" the pastor continued. Then, as though carried away by one of those ecstasies which caused men, especially men among the refugees of the mountains, to seem almost inspired, he continued: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your Excellency has said we attack those who are God\u0027s anointed. Do we so? Who formed the rebel league to exclude Henry of Navarre from the succession? Who was it struck that great king to the heart in the Rue de la Ferronnerie? Ravillac! Was he of the Reformed faith? Who would have turned Louis off the throne he now sits securely on, have set up the Prince of Condé in his place? Who? Who? Not Protestants for sure! Name one who has slain a king or attempted to slay one in all our land.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur Buscarlet,\" Baville replied, still containing himself, \"there is no accusation against those of your faith as to their desiring to slay King Louis. But they have revolted against all constituted authority, against all who here rule for the king, against his priests. Your statement as to what misguided men of our own faith have done helps you not. Two wrongs do not make one right. And because it is by the Protestants that the sacred soil of France is threatened, the Protestants must go. Nay, more: those who rebel must pay the penalty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n * * * * * * * \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur,\" said Baville, coming in two hours later to another room in which Martin sat, he and Buscarlet having been requested to leave the apartment in which the council were, after they had both testified to all that had happened at Montvert on the night when the abbé was slain, \"Monsieur, I have heard strange news of you. I wonder you did not see fit to tell me with whom I had the honour of conversing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With whom you had the honour of conversing!\" Martin replied, looking at him in astonishment. \"I think, sir, you forget. I told you my name, also where my property is--in France.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pardon me, you did so tell me.\" And, even as he spoke, Martin observed, to his still further astonishment, that the Intendant\u0027s manner had become one of almost deference, certainly of increased courtesy, though he had never been in any way impolite to him since they had met at Montvert. \"You did tell me that. What you omitted to inform me of, quite within your perfect right, doubtless, was that you were of the de Rochebazon family. Sir, permit me to congratulate you. There is no nobler house in all France, in Europe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your Excellency, I have not the honour to be of the house of de Rochebazon----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, instead, a relative of the late Princesse de Rochebazon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And as he spoke he did not doubt, nay, he felt sure, that he had given himself into this man\u0027s power. If he knew so much of the de Rochebazons as he seemed to do, he must know that the late princess had been an Englishwoman. Baville would also be aware, therefore, what his nationality was. Yet, still strong in the honour which lay deep within his heart; strong, too, in his determination to profit by no evasion of the truth when the telling of it was absolutely necessary, he announced his kinsmanship with her, looking straight into the Intendant\u0027s eyes as he did so. \\n\\n \\n\\n In an instant he recognised that he stood in no peril at present. Whatever Baville might know of the family of de Rochebazon, it was evident he did not know that the princess was not a Frenchwoman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur,\" Baville replied, \"it is the same thing. And, sir, I welcome you to Languedoc, you, a member of a great family which has stood ever by the throne, the Church. I hope you will make my house--it is at Montpellier--your resting place while you remain in the Midi. You will be very welcome.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thank your Excellency, but it is impossible I should accept. You will remember I told you I have a mission here--one that I can not put aside even amid the troublous times which have now arisen in the neighbourhood. I must prosecute my mission to the end.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To find the lost man you spoke of?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To find him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is he a de Rochebazon? If so, he should be very near to a great inheritance--an inheritance which, the Franciscan tells me (the monk who recognised you as the gentleman who attended the last moments of Madame la Princesse), the Church has fallen heir to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The monk! What monk? Yet--I remember. There were two at her bedside: one who watched continuously, another who came at the last moment. Which is he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can not say. Yet I will bring you into intercourse with him if you desire it. He is here to assist in stamping out this accursed Protestantism, in helping to convert them to the true faith.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your Excellency hates bitterly these Protestants.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hate the king\u0027s enemies. And all Protestants are such.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As the Intendant uttered these words Martin told himself the time had come. He must speak now or be henceforth a coward in his own esteem. It was for nothing that his father had cast off forever his allegiance to James, had openly acknowledged that henceforth he abjured the religion to which James belonged. Not for nothing, since by so doing he had stood his trial before Sir Francis Wytham and Sir Creswell Levinz, narrowly escaping Jeffreys himself. Not for nothing, since he had been fined and imprisoned, he who had followed the Stuarts into exile, almost ruined. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yet all would be for nothing--his father\u0027s tribulations, his own repudiation of the wealth his aunt had amassed for him--all would be worth nothing if now he stood here before this man and, hearing the cause reviled for which both father and son had sacrificed so much, held his peace like a coward. \\n\\n \\n\\n The time had come. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your Excellency,\" he said quietly, \"stigmatizes Protestants as accursed; also as the king\u0027s enemies. Well, as to being accursed I know not; it may be even as you say. But I do know that I am no enemy of King Louis. Yet--I am a Protestant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You!\" Baville exclaimed, taking a step back in sheer astonishment. \"You! Yet a kinsman by marriage of the de Rochebazons. It is impossible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nevertheless it is true.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Baville shrugged his shoulders, then suddenly turning round on him, he said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your sympathies, then, are with these rebels here. You approve, perhaps, of what you saw on the bridge at Montvert two nights ago. Are here, it may be, to foment further troubles.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mistake. I utterly disapprove of what I saw. Would indeed have saved the priest had it been in my power. It is not by cruelty that wrongs are righted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In Heaven\u0027s name, then, if these are your sentiments what makes you a Protestant?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Conviction. As conviction made that de Rochebazon a Protestant whom I am here to find some traces of, alive or dead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They had remained standing face to face with one another since the Intendant had come into the room; they were face to face still as Martin told how the missing heir to the de Rochebazon name and wealth had himself changed his religion, and, being face to face, he saw a strange look, a shade of startled perplexity, come into the countenance of Baville. Also he noticed that he paled perceptibly. Then the latter said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"De Rochebazon, the de Rochebazon, turned a Protestant! turned Protestant!--c\u0027est incroyable!--and came here to Languedoc. When--how long ago?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not know. Possibly forty years ago. Your Excellency,\" and now the clear blue eyes of the young man looked into the equally clear dark eyes of the ruler of the province, \"do you know aught of him? Can you put me in the way of finding him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I--no. Why do you ask? I came not here till \u002785. And--and--alas! that it should be so. It is their own doing. The Protestants and I have been at enmity ever since. They have made my rule a bitter one. It is their own doing, I repeat. Their own fault.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They have not risen until now. Done no overt act!\" Martin exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Unfortunately, they have done many. You do not know. And they have resisted the king\u0027s ordinances.\" Then changing the subject swiftly, he said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur Martin, you tell me you are here to seek this missing man; that you have no intention of aiding these rebels. I am glad to hear it. Yet, remember, if you remain here you do so at dire peril to yourself. If you take part in any act of rebellion, if you join in any way in their uprisings, proclaim yourself in the least as an opponent of the law and order which must be re-established at all costs here, then you too must be responsible for whatever may befall you. Do you think you can stay here and also remain neutral?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are there not others in France who, being of my faith, are doing so? Are there not still De Colignys, De Rohans, De la Trémoilles, De Sullys in France, surrounding the king\u0027s person? Yet they are loyal to him and he molests them not; accept their service; lets them worship God in their own way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They are not in Languedoc,\" Baville said briefly yet very pertinently. \"And the day will come when they will all return to their own faith. Otherwise France is not for them.[1] Nor will it be for you or yours.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Martin shrugged his shoulders at the latter part of this speech, since no answer was possible. France was not for him under any circumstances when he had once carried out his dead kinswoman\u0027s request, had found and done justice to Cyprien de Beauvilliers or his children, if he had left any, or, failing to find them, had at last discontinued his search. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Meanwhile,\" continued Baville, \"I would counsel you to reside at Montpellier. There, for the present at least, your co-religionists are not troublesome, and up to now I have not had to exercise the strong hand. Also,\" and now he bowed with the easy grace which had never forsaken him though he had been absent from Versailles for seventeen years, \"if you will permit me, if you will accept of any courtesy at my hands--at the hands of Baville, the hated Intendant--I shall be pleased to be of service to you. As a connection of the house of de Rochebazon I may do that, while as a private gentleman, who does not obtrude his religious belief upon me, I shall be happy to assist you in your quest. Though I warn you I do not think you will succeed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You think the man I seek for never came here, or, coming, is dead?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment the other paused ere answering, his handsome face indicating that he was lost in thought, his clear eyes gazing searchingly into the eyes of the other. \"I do not know. I can not say. It is most probable that if he ever came he is dead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Leaving no children?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can I say? At least--if--if he is dead he must have died and left no trace or sign. Died without divulging who he was.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Baville turned to the door as though to go; yet ere he did so he spoke again, repeating his words: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should counsel you to make Montpellier your resting place. If aught is to be learned I may help you to learn it there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thank you. Doubtless it would be best. Yet there is one request I must make to you; it is to--to deal gently with Buscarlet. On my word of honour as a gentleman, he has had no hand in these recent troubles. He besought those mountaineers who descended on Montvert to spare the abbé.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is nothing against Monsieur Buscarlet at present which calls for severity. Yet if he does not change his faith I know not what may be the end. If these Cévenoles do not desist, or are not stamped out, the retribution will be terrible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On all?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I fear on all. The Church never forgives. The Church will cry for vengeance against the Huguenots, and I, the ruler, must hear that cry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And answer it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And answer it; for their resistance is rebellion, and rebellion must be crushed. Warn him, therefore, to be on his guard. To preach, above all, obedience to the king. Otherwise there is no hope. The prisons are already full of his brethren. Bid him beware, I say. They term Louis the \u0027Scourge of God,\u0027 and they speak truly. He will scourge the land of all who oppose him. And if not he--then his wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1617/47873.html","bookId":1233,"book":{"id":1233,"title":"The Scourge of God","description":"简介： With all the pomp and ceremony that should accompany the dying hours of a great lady of France, the Princesse de Rochebazon--Marquise du Gast d\u0027An?illy, Comtesse de Montrachet, Baronne de Beauvilliers, and possessor of many other titles, as well as t...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1617","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:40 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:40 AM"}}
