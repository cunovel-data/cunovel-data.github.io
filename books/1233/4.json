{"id":19392,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. LES ATTROUPéS.","content":"It was October in the year 1701 when she who had borne the title for so long of Princesse de Rochebazon was laid in the family vault in the Church of St. Sépulcre. It was July of the next year when a gentleman, looking somewhat travel-stained and weary, halted his horse at the foot of the Mont de Lozère, in Languedoc--the same man who had travelled from England eight months ago as Martin Ashurst, to attend his aunt\u0027s death-bed, but who since then had been known as Monsieur Martin. \n \n There were more reasons than one why this change of name should be made--primarily because war having been declared by England in conjunction with Austria and Holland against Louis, no subject of Queen Anne was permitted within France, or, being in, would be safe if known and identified as such. But with an assumed name, or rather with part of his own name discarded--Martin being common to both countries--and with his knowledge of the French language perfect, owing to his long residence in the country as a child, the identification of Martin Ashurst with England was, if he held his peace, almost impossible. Also there were other reasons. He believed that at last he had found traces of the missing man, of him to whom by right fell all the vast wealth of the de Rochebazons, accumulated for centuries. \n \n \"Yet even now,\" he said to himself, \"God knows if I shall succeed in finding him, or even should I do so, if I shall persuade him to claim what is his own. And, though he should still be willing, will that scourge of God, Louis, that curse of France, his wife, let one penny ever come to his hands? A Huguenot, and with the Huguenots in open rebellion, what chance would he have? I must be careful, more careful than ever, now that I am in the hotbed of revolution.\" \n \n As he pondered thus he turned his wrist and urged his horse forward at a walk, making his way on slowly through the mountains to the village of Montvert. \n \n \"Three months,\" he said, \"three months since I set out for Switzerland--for Geneva and Lausanne--and now, even now, but little nearer to the end than before. Coming here, I was told that it was almost impossible that Cyprien de Beauvilliers could have settled in the Cévennes without being known; travelling on to Savoy and to Lausanne, I learn at last that he did most undoubtedly come here from Geneva years ago. Shall I ever know--ever find out?\" \n \n A league or so accomplished at a walking pace, for his poor beast was almost exhausted now, it having been ridden across the mountains from St. Victor de Gravière since daybreak, and from Geneva within the last three weeks, and the banks of a river named Le Tarn being slowly followed, the rider entered Montvert, and passing across the bridge, proceeded slowly up the village street. Yet even as he did so he cast his eyes on a house at the side of that bridge and on the small trim garden between it and the stream, muttering to himself: \n \n \"Ah! Monsieur l\u0027abbé! Monsieur l\u0027abbé! you are one of the firebrands who stir up dissension in these valleys--you and your familiar spirit, Baville. Also your evil fame has travelled far. You are known and hated in Geneva, Lausanne, Vevey--maybe in Holland by now. \u0027Tis best you pray to Heaven to avert your fate. \u0027Tis threatened! And, if all the stories of you be true, it is almost deserved, no matter in what form it comes.\" \n \n Proceeding still farther along the little main street of the bourg, he came to a wooden house also standing in a small trimly-kept garden, in which there grew all kinds of simple flowers that made the place gay with their colours, and here he dismounted, while calling to a boy who was raking the crushed shells on the path, he bade him take his horse to the stable in the rear. \n \n \"For you see, Armand,\" he said with a pleasant smile, \"here I am back again, after a long while--yet still back.\" \n \n The boy smiled a greeting and said all would be glad to welcome him, then did as he was bid and led the animal away, while Martin, going up to the door, knocked lightly on it and asked, as he threw his voice into the passage, if the pasteur was within. \n \n To which, in answer, there came down toward the door an elderly gray-haired man, who held out both his hands and shook those of the younger one cordially. \n \n \"Back! Back!\" he exclaimed joyously. \"Ah! this is good. Come in. Come in. The room is always ready, the bed kept aired, the lavender in the drawers. Welcome! Welcome!\" Then, after looking at him and saying that his journey had not harmed him, he exclaimed: \"Well, what news? Or--is it disappointment again?\" \n \n \"But little news; scarcely, in truth, more than before. Yet something. I met a man at Geneva who had known Cyprien de Beauvilliers, but he was very old and, alas! it is forty years and more since he set eyes on him.\" \n \n \"Forty years! A lifetime!\" \n \n \"Ay, a lifetime--long enough for him to have disappeared from all human knowledge, to have died. That, I fear, is what has happened. Otherwise, this man says, they of the reformed faith would almost surely have heard of him.\" \n \n \"Not of necessity,\" the pastor answered. \"If he so hated his kin and their religion that he was determined to break off forever from them and their customs, he may have resolved to obliterate every clew. He told the princess\u0027s husband that he renounced his name, his birthright. Other men have resolved on that, and kept their resolution.\" \n \n While they had been speaking the pastor had led Martin Ashurst into his little salon, and he called now to an elderly woman to prepare the evening meal. \n \n \"And a good one to-night, Margot; a good one to-night to welcome back the wanderer.\" \n \n Whereon the old servant smiled upon that wanderer and murmured also some words of greeting, while she said it should be a good one. Fichtre, but it should! \n \n \"Soit! Let us see,\" went on her master. \"First for the solids. Now, there is a trout, caught this morning and brought me by Leroux--oh, such a trout! Two kilos if an ounce, and with the true deep speckles. Ma foi! he was a fool, he clung too much to the neighbourhood of the lower bridge, derided Leroux with his wicked eye; yet, observe, Leroux has got him. Si! Si! Half an hour hence he will be truite au vin blanc, a thing not half so wholesome for him as the stream and the rushes. Hein!\" \n \n Martin smiled to himself, yet gravely, as always now since his aunt\u0027s dying revelation. How far off seemed to him the merry days, or nights, at Locket\u0027s and Pontac\u0027s, and the jokes and jeers and flashes of wit of Betterton and Nokes, Vanburgh and gentle Farquhar!--while still the good old pastor prattled on, happy at preparing his little feast. \n \n \"Truite au vin blanc. Ha! And the right wine, too, to wash it down. Ha! The Crépi, in the long, tapering glasses that the Chevalier de Fleuville brought me from Villefranche. Poor de Fleuville! Poor, poor de Fleuville! Then, Margot, the rago?t and the white chipped bread, and, forget not these, clean serviettes to-night, if we never have others, and the cheese from Joyeuse. Oh! we will faire la noce to-night, mon brave. God forgive me,\" he broke off suddenly, his voice changing, \"that even your return should make me think of feasts and noces at such a time as this--a time of blood and horror and cruelty!\" \n \n Over the meal, the trout being all that was expected of him, and the Crépi a fitting accompaniment thereto, they talked on what had been the object of \"Monsieur Martin\u0027s\" journey into Switzerland, then neutral in both religion and politics, and offering, consequently, a home for refugees of all classes and denominations; talked also of what results that journey had had, or had failed to have. But all ended, or was comprised, in what the young man had already told the other--namely, that it seemed certain that Cyprien de Beauvilliers had at first gone to Geneva and Lausanne after he renounced his family and his religion, and that from there he had come to Languedoc, meaning to settle in the one spot in France where Protestantism was in its strongest force. \n \n \"He would thereby,\" the pastor said, as now they reached the fromage de Joyeuse, nestling white and creamy in the vine leaves, \"be able to enjoy his religion in peace for many years, until--until the unhappy events of \u002785. Alas! that revocation! That revocation, born of that fearful woman! What--what will be the outcome of all, for even now it is but beginning to bear its worst fruits. Martin,\" he continued, \"Martin, mon ami, we are but at the commencement. I fear for what will happen here ere long. I fear, I fear, I fear.\" \n \n \"Here! Is it as bad as that?\" \n \n \"It is dreadful, appalling. My friend, they will suffer no longer. They can support neither Baville\u0027s tyranny, which extends over all the district, nor--here, in this little village once so happy--the monstrous cruelties of the abbé.\" \n \n \"The abbé! Du Chaila! What is he doing now?\" \n \n \"Tongue scarce dare tell for fear of not being believed. In after years, in centuries to come, when religion is free and tolerant, as some day it must be--it must! it must!--those who read of what we have suffered will deem the story false. O Martin! there, in that house by the bridge, are done things that would almost excite the envy of the Inquisition, ay! of Torquemada himself, were he still in existence. And he, this abbé, is the man who will light the flame in this tranquil spot. I pray God it may be extinguished almost ere lit.\" And Martin Ashurst saw that even as he spoke his hands were folded under the table, as though in prayer, and that his lips moved. \n \n \"But what,\" he said, \"what do you fear? Also to what extremes does he now proceed?\" \n \n \"\u0027Proceed!\u0027 Ah, Martin, listen. There in that house by the bridge, once Fleuville\u0027s, who was hung by De Genne upon the bridge itself, so that his wife might see the thing each morning when she rose, he tortures us, the Protestants. Keeps prisoners confined, too, in the cellars deeper than the river itself. In stocks some, naked some, some with food only twice a week. He boasts he is God\u0027s appointed, then jeers and says, \u0027Appointed, too, by Baville under Louis.\u0027\" \n \n \"And Louis knows this?\" \n \n \"Some say not, some say yes. For myself, I do not know. But things are near the end.\" And again the good pastor murmured, \"I fear, I fear, I fear.\" Then went on, his voice lowered now and his eyes glancing through the windows, opened to let in the soft autumn air, cool and luscious as though it had passed over countless groves of flowers: \"Listen. Masip--you have heard of him, Masip, the guide, he who shows the way to Switzerland and freedom--he is now there, in the cellars, in the stocks, bent double, his hands through two holes above the two where his feet are.\" \n \n \"For what?\" \n \n \"He showed the Demoiselles Sexti the road to Chambery--they went dressed as boys. The girls escaped into the mountains. Masip is doomed. He dies to-morrow.\" \n \n \"God help him!\" \n \n \"Him! God help all, Martin. He hunts us everywhere. Some of my brother preachers have been executed; I myself am suspended, my hour may come--to-night--to-morrow. Sooner or later it must come. Then for me the wheel or the flames or the gibbet--there.\" And he pointed down the street toward where the bridge was on which Fleuville\u0027s body had been hanged. \n \n \"Never! Never!\" Martin exclaimed, touching the old man\u0027s arm. \"Never, while I have a sword by my side.\" Then added, a moment later: \n \n \"My friend, I must declare myself. While all are so brave, all going to, or risking, their doom, I am but a craven hound to wear a mask. To-morrow I announce--or rather denounce--myself as a Protestant. My aunt died ere I could tell the secret which would have caused her to curse me instead of leaving me her heir. Here, I will shelter myself under that secret no more. To-morrow I see this abbé in his own house, to-morrow I defy him to do his worst on me as on others. I proclaim myself.\" \n \n \"No, no, no!\" the old pastor cried, springing at him, placing his hand upon his lips to prevent further words from being heard or from penetrating outside. \"No, no! In God\u0027s name, no! I forbid you. If you do that, how will you ever find de Beauvilliers--de Rochebazon, as he is if alive--or, he being dead, find his children? I forbid you,\" he reiterated again and again in his agitation. \"I forbid you.\" \n \n \"Forbid me? Force me to live a coward in my own esteem? To see those of my own faith slaughtered like oxen in the shambles and stand by, a poltroon, afraid to declare myself?\" \n \n \"I forbid you. Not yet, at least. Remember, too, you are an Englishman, of France\u0027s deepest, most hated foes; your doom is doubly threatening. Yet, oh, oh, my son,\" he exclaimed in a broken voice, \"how I love, how I reverence you! Brave man, brave, honest Protestant, I love--my God!\" he exclaimed, changing his tone suddenly, desisting in his speech, \"My God! what is that?\" \n \n Desisted, turning a stricken, blanched face upon the younger man, who had reached for his sword and sash and was already donning them, while he whispered through white lips, \"It has come! It has come! The storm has burst,\" while even as he spoke he fell on his knees by the table, and sinking his head into his hands, commenced to pray long and silently. \n \n Prayed long and silently, while from outside the bourg--yet advancing, approaching nearer every moment--there came a deep sound. At first a hum, then, next, a clearer, more definite noise, and next, they being distinguishable, the words of a hymn sung by many voices. \n \n Upon the soft night air, so calm and peaceful a moment earlier, those words rolled, the cadence falling and rising until it seemed as though it must reach the mountain tops o\u0027erhanging the village. Rolled up and swelled, and sunk and rose again, telling how the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who came against Judah; telling how, when they had made an end of one of their particular foes, each helped to destroy another. \n \n Again the pastor moaned: \"They have risen. They have risen. God help us all!\" \n \n \"Who?\" asked Martin. \"Who? Our own faith? The Protestants? The Camisards? Risen at last.\" \n \n \"At last! At last!\" the old man said, glancing up from his prayers. And he began to pray aloud to God to avert the horrors of battle and murder and sudden death. \n \n The tramp of many men came nearer. Past the foot of the garden those men went, a compact mass; in their hands and belts, and borne also upon their shoulders, swords, old halberds, musketoons and pistols, in some cases scythes and reaping hooks. And ahead of all marched three gaunt, weird men, the inspired ones, the prophets of the Cevennes, of the Camisards. \n \n \"Keep all within doors,\" a deep-toned voice exclaimed from out the throng, \"on pain of death. Disturb not the children of God, his persecuted ones. No harm is meant to those who interfere not. Keep within doors, also appear not at the windows. All will thereby be well.\" \n \n And again the psalm uprose, though now there were some who shouted: \"To the vile abbé\u0027s! To the murderer\u0027s! To the house on the bridge! On! On! The soldiers first, the abbé next! On! On! To avenge the Lord!\" \n \n Then from farther ahead there rang the report of musketry, and one man fell dead pell-mell among the moving crowd, and was left lying in the white dust of the roadway, as from the window Martin could well see. But still the others shouted: \"On! On! God\u0027s will be done!\" \n \n And again the pastor lifted his hands from where he knelt and cried aloud, \"From battle, murder, and sudden death, good Lord deliver us.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1617/47856.html","bookId":1233,"book":{"id":1233,"title":"The Scourge of God","description":"简介： With all the pomp and ceremony that should accompany the dying hours of a great lady of France, the Princesse de Rochebazon--Marquise du Gast d\u0027An?illy, Comtesse de Montrachet, Baronne de Beauvilliers, and possessor of many other titles, as well as t...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1617","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:40 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:40 AM"}}
