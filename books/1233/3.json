{"id":19391,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. A PARTING SOUL.","content":"Looking down upon her as she lay in the great bed whereon had reposed so many of the de Rochebazons for generations--when they had been the head of the house--Martin Ashurst told himself how, except for the reason that he was about to lose the kindest benefactress and kinswoman any man had ever had, there was no cause for the tears to rise to his eyes. For never was a more peaceful parting about to be made, to all external appearances; never could a woman have trod more calmly the dark road that, sooner or later, all have to pass along, than was now treading Aurora, Princesse de Rochebazon. Also it seemed as if death was smoothing away every wrinkle that time had brought to her face, changing back that face to the soft, innocent one which, in the spring of life, had been Aurora Ashurst\u0027s greatest charm; the face that had been hers when, as a winsome child, she played in the meadows round her father\u0027s old home in Worcestershire--demolished by Lambert; the face that, but a few years later, had won Henri de Beauvilliers away from the intoxicating charms of Mancinis, of Clerembaults, of Baufremonts, and Chatillons, and a hundred other beauties who then revolved round the court of the young king, now grown so old. \"You do not suffer, dear and honoured one,\" Martin said, bending over her and gazing into the eyes that were still so bright--the last awful glazed look and vacant stare, which tell of the near end being still some hours off; \"you do not suffer, dear one. That I can see, and thank God for so seeing.\" \"No,\" the princess said, \"I have no pain. I am dying simply of what comes to all--decay. I am seventy years of age, and it has come to me a little earlier than it does sometimes. That is all. But, Martin, we have no time to talk of this. Time is short--I know that.\" Then, suddenly lifting the clear eyes to his own, she said, \"Do you know why I sent a special courier to London for you?\" \"To bid me hurry to you, I should suppose, dear one. To give me your blessing. Oh!\" he exclaimed, bending a little nearer to her, \"you are a saint. You would not part from me without giving me that. Therefore bless me now!\" and he made as though he would kneel by her side betwixt the bed and the ruelle. \"Wait,\" she said, \"wait. I have something to tell you. After I have done so I know not if you will still deem me a saint, still desire my blessing. Bring that chair within the ruelle; sit down and listen.\" Because he thought that already her mind was beginning to enter that hazy approach to death in which the senses lose all clearness, and the dying, when they speak at all, speak wanderingly, he neither showed nor felt wonderment at her words. Instead, because he desired to soothe and calm her, he did as she bade him, drawing the chair within the rail and holding her hand as he did so. \"Whatever,\" he said softly, \"you may tell me can make no difference in my love and reverence for you--make me desire your blessing less or deem you less a saint. Yet--yet--if it pleases you to speak, if you have aught you desire to say, say on. Still, I beseech you, weary not yourself.\" At first she did not answer him, but lay quite still, her eyes fixed on his face; lay so still that from far down the room he heard the ticking of the clock, heard the logs fall softly together with a gentle clash now and again, even found himself listening to a bird twittering outside in the garden. Then, suddenly, once more her voice sounded clearly in the silence of the room; he heard her say: \"What I tell you now will make me accursed in the eyes of all the Church--our Church. I am about to confide to you a secret that all in that Church have ordered me never to divulge, or I would have done it long since. Yet now I must tell it.\" \"A secret,\" he repeated silently to himself, \"a secret!\" Therefore he knew that her mind must indeed be wandering. What secret could this saintly woman have to reveal? Ah! yes, she was indeed wandering! Yet, even as he thought this, he reflected how strange a thing it was that, while he had actually a revelation to make to her--one that his honour prompted him to make--she, in the delirium of coming death, should imagine that she had something which it behooved her to disclose. Once more he heard her speaking. Heard her say: \"All deem that with me perishes the last bearer, man or woman, of the de Rochebazon name. It is not so. There is probably one in existence.\" \"Madame!\" the young man exclaimed very quietly, yet startled, almost appalled. \"Madame! A de Rochebazon in existence! Are you conscious of what you are saying?\" and he leaned a little over the coverlet and gazed into her eyes as he spoke. Surely this was wandering. \"As conscious as that I am dying here, as that you, Martin Ashurst, are sitting by my side.\" \"I am astounded. How long has what you state been known--supposed--by you?\" \"Known--not supposed--since I became Henri de Beauvillier\u0027s wife, forty-six years ago.\" \"My God! What does it mean? A de Rochebazon alive! Man or woman?\" \"Man!\" Again Martin exclaimed, \"My God!\" Then added: \"And this man, therefore, is, has been since the death of your husband, the Prince de Rochebazon?\" \"Before my husband\u0027s death,\" the other answered quietly, calmly, as though speaking on the most trivial subject. \"My husband never was the prince.\" Unintentionally, without doubt--perhaps, too, unnoticed by her--his hand released hers, slipping down from the bedside to his knee, where it lay, while he, his eyes fixed full on her now and still seeking to read in her face whether that which she uttered was the frenzy of a dying woman or an absolute truth, said slowly and distinctly: \"Nor you, therefore--that I must utter the words!--the princess?\" \"Nor I the princess.\" \"It is incredible. Beyond all belief.\" \"It is true.\" Again there was a pause; filled up on Martin Ashurst\u0027s part with a hurtling mass of thoughts which he could not separate one from the other, though above all others there predominated one--the thought that this was the derangement of a mind unhinged by the weakness of approaching death, clouded by the gradual decay of nature. And, thinking thus, he sat silent, wondering if in very truth--since all she had said seemed so utterly beyond the bound of possibility--it were worth disturbing her with questions. Yet her next words seemed uttered as though with a determination to force him to believe that what she had said was no delusion. \"There are others who know it--only they will never tell.\" \"Others! Who?\" \"Madame knows it\"--he was well enough aware what \"Madame\" she referred to, and that it was to neither her of Orleans nor any of the daughters of the house of France--\"so, too, does La Chaise, and also Chamillart. Also,\" and now her voice sank to a whisper, \"Louis.\" \"Louis!\" he repeated, also whisperingly, yet not recognising that his voice was lowered instinctively. \"The king! knows and permits. My God!\" \"He must permit, seeing that she--De Maintenon--holds him in a grasp of steel.\" \"Knowing--herself?\" \"I have said.\" Again over the room there fell a silence, broken only by the ticking of the distant clock; also now the shadows of evening were drawing on, soon the night would be at hand--a silence caused by the dying woman having ceased to speak, by the man at her side forbearing to ask more questions. Yet he was warned by signs which even he, who had as yet but little acquaintance with death, could not misinterpret; that what more was to be told must be declared at once, or--never. For the dying woman made no further effort to divulge more, or to explain aught which should elucidate the strange statement she had startled him with; instead, lay back upon her pillows, her eyes open, it was true, but staring vacantly upon the embossed and richly-painted ceiling, her breathing still regular but very low. \"She will speak no more,\" he said to himself, \"no more. Thank God, the secret does not die with her. Yet will those whom she has mentioned--this woman who is the king\u0027s wife; the king himself; La Chaise, who, if all accounts are true, is a lying, crafty priest; the minister Chamillart--will they assist to right a wrong? Alas, I fear not! Ah, if she could but speak again--tell all!\" As thus he thought, the door opened and the waiting maid came in, accompanied by a gentleman clad in sombre black, his lace being, however, of the whitest and most costly nature, and his face as white as that lace itself. And the girl, advancing down the room, followed by the other, explained to Martin, when she had reached the bed, that the gentleman accompanying her was Monsieur Fagon, premier Médecin du Roi. Bowing to him with much courtliness, the physician passed within the ruelle and stood gazing down upon the dying woman in what was now no better than twilight, but going through, as the other observed, none of the usual ceremonies of feeling the pulse or listening to the breathing. Then once he nodded his head, after which he turned away, stepping outside the ruelle. \"What may we hope, monsieur?\" the young man asked, following Fagon down the room. \"What,\" answered Fagon in return, \"does monsieur hope?\" \"That she may be spared for yet some hours--more, I fear, can scarcely be expected. Also that she may be able to speak again and clearly. I am her nephew, and, in a manner of speaking, am--was to be--her heir.\" From under his bushy eyebrows Fagon shot a glance out of his small twinkling eyes. Then he said: \"So I have heard. Yet monsieur, if he will pardon me, phrases his statement strangely, in spite of his having the French extremely well. \u0027Was to be her heir!\u0027 Has monsieur reason to apprehend that Madame la Princesse has made any alteration in her testamentary dispositions?\" \"Monsieur has no reason to apprehend that such is the case. Yet,\" changing the subject, \"he would be very glad if he could know that some hours of life will still be granted to--to--Madame la Princesse; that he might hope she will be able to converse again.\" \"Sir,\" Fagon said, with still the little twinkling eyes upon him, \"she may live two or three more hours. I doubt her ever speaking again. There is no more to be done. Sir, I salute you.\" With which words he departed, escorted by the maid servant Manon. It seemed, however, to Martin as though even should his aunt recover consciousness and be able to throw any further light upon the strange story which she had commenced, no opportunity would arise for her to do so, for Fagon had not been gone a quarter of an hour, during which time she lay so motionless in her bed that more than once he gazed down upon her, wondering if already the soul had parted from the body, before the monk who had previously been in attendance came in, and going toward the great fireplace drew forth his missal and began to read it. Nor was it without some difficulty that Martin was able to induce him to quit the room. \"Depart!\" this holy man said, glancing up at the tall form of the other as he whispered his request to him. \"Depart, my son! Alas! do you not know that the end is near--that at any moment the last services of the Church may be required to speed the passing soul?\" \"I know, nor do I intend that she shall be deprived of those services. But, reverend sir, it is necessary I should be alone with my kinswoman; if she recovers her intelligence even at the last moment we have much to say to one another. I beg you, therefore, to leave us together; be sure you shall not be debarred from ministering to her when she desires you. I request you to remain outside--yet within call.\" Because he knew not how to resist, because also he was but a humble member of the Théatine confraternity who, in Paris at least, owed much to the wealth and support of the Rochebazons, also because in his ignorance he thought he stood in the presence of him who was, he imagined in his simplicity, the next possessor of that great name and the vast revenues attached to it, he went as bidden, begging only that he might be summoned at the necessary moment. Then for a little while kinsman and kinswoman were alone once more. \"Will she ever speak again, tell me further?\" Martin mused again, gazing down on the silent woman lying there, her features now lit up a little by the rays of a shaded veilleuse that had been brought into the chamber by Manon and placed near the great bed. \"I pray God she may.\" Then murmured to himself: \"As well as I can see--\u0027tis but darkly, Heaven knows--yet so far as I can peer into the future, on me there falls the task of righting a great wrong, done, if not by her, at least by those to whose house she belongs. But, to do so much, I must have light.\" It seemed to him, watching there, as though the light was coming--was at hand. For now the occupant of the bed by which he sat stirred; her eyes, he saw, were fixed on him; a moment later she spoke. But the voice was changed, he recognised--was hoarse and harsh, hollow and toneless. \"Henri,\" she murmured, with many pauses \u0027twixt her words, \"Henri was not the eldest. There was--another--son--a--a--Protestant--a Huguenot----\" \"Great God! what sin is here?\" the startled watcher muttered; then spoke more loudly: \"Yes, yes, oh, speak, speak! Continue, I beseech you. Another son--a Huguenot--and the eldest!\" \"That a de Rochebazon should be--a--Huguenot,\" the now dry voice muttered raucously, \"a Huguenot! And fierce--relentless--strong, even to renouncing all--all--his rank, his name, his birthri----\" Again she ceased; he thought the end had come. Surely the once clear eyes were glazing now, surely this dull glare at vacancy which expressed indefinitely that, glare how they might, they saw nothing, foretold death--near, close at hand. \"Some word, some name, madame, dear one,\" the listener whispered. \"Speak, oh! speak, or else all effort must fail. His name--that which his brother called him--that which he took, if he renounced his rightful one. The name--or--God help us all! naught can be done.\" \"His name,\" the dying woman whispered through white lips, in accents too low to reach the listener\u0027s ears, \"was----\" If she uttered it he did not hear it. Moreover, at this supreme moment there came another interruption--the last! The door opened again. Down the room, advancing toward the bed, came a priest, a man thin to attenuation, dry and brown as a mummy, with eyes that burned like coals beneath an eyebrowless forehead, yet one who told his beads even as he advanced, his lips quivering and moving while he prayed. Do the dying know, even as we bend over them, seeking to penetrate beneath that glassy stare which suggests so deep an oblivion, of the last word we would have them speak, the last question we would have answered ere the veil of dense impenetrable darkness falls forever between them and us? Almost it seemed as if she, this sinking woman who had lived for years a great princess, yet, by her own avowal, was none, did in truth know what her kinsman sought to drag from her--the clew which should lead to the righting of a great wrong, as he had said. For, as the priest came through the lurking shadows of the room and out of the darkness of the farther end, toward where the small night lamp cast its sickly shadow, the hand which Martin Ashurst held closed tighter upon his own, and with a quivering grasp drew his toward her body, placing it upon a small substance that had lain sheltering \u0027twixt her arm and side. And even as thus his hand closed over hers, while that other quivered warm and damp within it, the priest knelt and, over his crucifix, uttered up prayers for the passing soul.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1617/47855.html","bookId":1233,"book":{"id":1233,"title":"The Scourge of God","description":"简介： With all the pomp and ceremony that should accompany the dying hours of a great lady of France, the Princesse de Rochebazon--Marquise du Gast d\u0027An?illy, Comtesse de Montrachet, Baronne de Beauvilliers, and possessor of many other titles, as well as t...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1617","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:40 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:40 AM"}}
