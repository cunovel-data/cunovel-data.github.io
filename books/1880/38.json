I\u0027m gonna kill her.\" And then my mind really starts jumping to conclusions, like how hard it would be for him to turn down a naked woman in the shower when he\u0027s so hard up after almost three months without sex. \"Did you fuck her?\"\\n\\n \"Hell, no! I can\u0027t believe you just asked me that.\"\\n\\n I see from his expression that I\u0027ve hurt him. \"I\u0027m sorry. I was just thinking of how long it\u0027s been since we were together, and I know you must be incredibly frustrated.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care how long it\u0027s been. My balls will never be blue enough to want a piece of that.\"\\n\\n \"What did you say to her?\"\\n\\n \"That I\u0027d never be with her again because I loved you and we were going to get married. I know you haven\u0027t given me an answer, but my heart tells me you\u0027re going to come and I\u0027m marrying you when you do.\"\\n\\n He hasn\u0027t given up on us. Or me. But I don\u0027t have a choice anymore. It\u0027s time for me to get my ass down there and be with my man before I let him slip away. Eleven weeks down. One week to go. But I\u0027m done with this shit! Adios!\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-Eight\\n\\n Laurelyn\u0027s tour comes to an end next week and I hope it marks the beginning of a new start for our future together. She has continued to be mysterious about her plans and hasn\u0027t verbally committed to anything one way or another. It concerns me, but I haven\u0027t wanted to push the envelope for fear of blowing it with her.\\n\\n Originally, she was scheduled two weeks off once the tour ended and then she\u0027d be back in the studio to begin working on the next album, but things have changed since then. I gave her a ring and told her I wanted to marry her.\\n\\n It\u0027s been three months, and although it is per my request, she hasn\u0027t given me an official answer. Not knowing is beginning to wear on me. I pretend to be patient, but I\u0027m not. I want her here and every day is a battle to not demand she come immediately so we can begin our forever.\\n\\n Frankly, it\u0027s a little depressing that she didn\u0027t drop her entire life the moment I put that ring on her finger. In the back of my mind, I\u0027d hoped she would, but then I remember that her strong will and independence are some of the things I love so much about her. I like that she has a life and it doesn\u0027t solely revolve around me. But then the selfish part of me despises it at the same time.\\n\\n It\u0027s been a long day and I\u0027m exhausted when I come home for the evening. It\u0027s a little late for Mrs. Porcelli to still be here, but I find her in the kitchen. \"Perfect timing, Mr. McLachlan. I was just taking dinner out of the oven.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s a familiar smell but one I don\u0027t usually associate with Mrs. Porcelli\u0027s cooking. It smells just like my girl\u0027s lasagna. \"That smells just like Laurelyn\u0027s been in here cooking.\"\\n\\n \"It should. It\u0027s her lasagna.\"\\n\\n I\u0027ve missed her cooking a lot, so this is a nice token to remind me of what a good cook she is. \"Thank you. I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be delicious.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Porcelli gathers her things and is on her way out the door. \"A package came for you today. I put it in your bedroom.\"\\n\\n I haven\u0027t placed any kind of order that I can recall and I\u0027m not expecting a parcel. \"What kind of package is it?\"\\n\\n She grins as she says, \"I believe it\u0027s something from Laurelyn. Have a good evening, sir.\" She goes out the door before I can respond.\\n\\n Like a child at Christmas, I can\u0027t get to my bedroom quick enough to see what Laurelyn might\u0027ve sent me. My mind reels with all kinds of expectations as I walk—or maybe dash—down the hallway.\\n\\n The door to my bedroom is closed but I don\u0027t have time to sort out why because I\u0027m anxiously swinging it open with the expectation of seeing a box on my bed. What I find lying there tops any possible expectations I could\u0027ve had.\\n\\n It\u0027s my beautiful Laurelyn.\\n\\n She\u0027s lying on her side facing me when I enter my bedroom. Her head is propped in her hand, her elbow pressing into the mattress, her long legs slightly bent, one more so than the other. Her brunette locks hang in loose curls and she\u0027s wearing one of my button-downs—unbuttoned. It\u0027s opened just enough for me to see that she\u0027s naked beneath and I\u0027m instantly hard.\\n\\n My brain turns to complete and utter mush because all of my blood is pumping straight to the organ my body thinks is most vital at the moment—my cock—and I go stupid. I can\u0027t say anything. All I can do is stare at her stretched across my bed.\\n\\n \"Hello, Jack Henry,\" she says while she smirks and moves to sit up on the bed. \"Surprised much?\"\\n\\n There\u0027s a disconnect between my brain and mouth but luckily, the connection to my feet is working. I close the distance between us and she rises to her knees to meet me in the middle of the bed.\\n\\n My heart pounds as I take her face in my hands and hold it as I kiss her mouth. It feels new even after having done it so many times. I\u0027m vigorous because I don\u0027t have a choice. I haven\u0027t tasted her in months and I\u0027m in withdrawals.\\n\\n I\u0027m still holding her face when I stop kissing her and press my forehead to hers. \"I\u0027ve missed you so much. There hasn\u0027t been a single minute when you weren\u0027t on my mind.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I\u0027ve missed you too. I wanted to come months ago, but I couldn\u0027t leave Charlie and the guys hanging after they were so good to me.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what that means, but I\u0027m not beating around the bush. \"Is this just a visit or have you come to me so we can start our lives together?\"\\n\\n \"This is the beginning of our forever.\"\\n\\n \"Then there\u0027s something I\u0027m supposed to do.\"\\n\\n I take her hands and pull her with me as I slide off the bed. She\u0027s standing in front of me as I drop to my knee the way she told me she would expect me to do when I properly asked her to marry me. I take her left hand and she\u0027s wearing the ring I gave her months ago. I bring it to my lips and kiss it. \"I love you with every fiber of my being.\" She beams and I\u0027m certain she knows what\u0027s coming next. \"I never want to be separated from you again. It\u0027s my heart\u0027s only desire that you become my wife and the mother of my children. Will you marry me?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" It\u0027s one word. Simple. And it\u0027s all I need.\\n\\n I push the shirt covering her stomach away and press my face against her bareness beneath it. \"I swear I\u0027ll make you happy.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t doubt that for a second,\" she says as she runs her hand through my hair. \"I don\u0027t want to wait. I want to be your wife as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n I kiss her stomach and then look up at her from where I am now on both of my knees. \"God, I\u0027m so glad to hear you say that. I don\u0027t want to wait, either.\" She\u0027s still running her fingers through my hair as she smiles down at me and I slide my hands around to her bottom. \"There\u0027s something else I can\u0027t wait to do.\"\\n\\n \"What \u0027cha wanna bet it\u0027s the same something I have on my mind?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think we have to do any kind of betting.\" She reaches for my hands on her bum and uses them to pull me up from the floor. \"We both know I\u0027m always your sure thing—any way you want me.\"\\n\\n She pulls the button of my jeans free and quickly gets my fly open so she can slide her hand inside. She wraps it around me and begins sliding it up and down. \"I\u0027ve missed this too.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s been too long since I was inside her and I feel like I\u0027ll come just from her touch on my cock. \"Whoa, baby. I\u0027m gonna come in your hand if you keep doing that.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027d rather do it inside me, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Abso-fucking-lutely.\"\\n\\n She turns around and peels the shoulders of the shirt back and lets it fall to her feet. She steps back and her bottom meets my crotch. She rubs it against me as she says, \"I know how you want to do this.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m about to explode but I don\u0027t want the first time of our forever to be like that. I want to make love to her and see her face while I do it. \"Not this time,\" I say as I grasp her hips and turn her around. \"I want to see my wife-to-be\u0027s face when I make love to her.\"\\n\\n \"If I were wearing panties, that would\u0027ve melted them right off.\" She sits on the bed and scoots back before putting her feet on the railing and spreading her knees wide. \"Come here and make me scream until everyone on this side of town knows your name.\"\\n\\n \"I can do that.\" I lift her feet and hook her legs over my shoulders. I grasp her hips and lift them until she\u0027s in the perfect position. I take a moment to smell before I taste. \"There\u0027s no telling how many times I\u0027ve sniffed your undies while we\u0027ve been apart, but nothing can replace this.\" I bury my nose against her and inhale until my lungs feel like they\u0027ll explode. \"There is no substitute for this.\"\\n\\n I can stand it no longer. I\u0027m a starving man dying to taste her. When I do, it\u0027s even better than I remember. Within seconds she\u0027s squirming her hips against my mouth and moaning. \"There is no replacement for that, either.\"\\n\\n She isn\u0027t going to last long at this rate, but it makes me happy to know that I can still make her orgasm so easily. \"Do you want me to slow down to make it last longer?\"\\n\\n She grabs the back of my head and pulls my mouth back down against her. \"No! Don\u0027t you even think about stopping or slowing down. I\u0027m right on the edge and fairly certain I\u0027ll die if you don\u0027t let me come soon.\"\\n\\n I reach up and give her the okay signal to signify my compliance because I\u0027m afraid to try to tell her. As I suspect, it\u0027s maybe fifteen seconds later when she begins to tense and quiver. I hear her breathing increase as she moans, and I\u0027m pretty certain when she pulls my hair that the east side of town hears her scream my name.\\n\\n I don\u0027t dare stop until I feel her relax against me. That\u0027s when I know she\u0027s feeling the euphoria, but I can\u0027t help myself. I\u0027m like a beast as I move fast so I can get inside her. I wanted to make love to her but I can\u0027t because it\u0027s been too long. It\u0027ll have to wait until next time, but I\u0027m not worried because I already know that won\u0027t be long. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-38.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \\n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \\n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
