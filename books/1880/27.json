I lift my hips and she\u0027s careful to avoid snagging my hard-on as she slides them to my feet before tossing them onto the floor.\\n\\n After I\u0027m naked from the waist down, she rises to her knees and runs her hands up my thighs before she rakes her nails slowly down my legs. \"I\u0027m gonna suck you off so good, you\u0027ll forget your own name.\"\\n\\n \"I dare you.\"\\n\\n She grabs me where my legs are bent and gives me a jerk to scoot my body closer to her. Frankly, I\u0027m a little surprised because I didn\u0027t realize she was packing that kind of strength in her tiny body.\\n\\n Her eyes watch mine as her tongue touches the base of my cock and she slides it slowly up the shaft until reaching the tip. She swipes her tongue back and forth across the end before tilting her head and wrapping her mouth around the base from the side. She glides her mouth upward and then covers me as she takes me fully inside her mouth.\\n\\n I love watching her do that. It never gets old.\\n\\n I lace my fingers through her nape and massage the muscles of her neck as each stroke of her mouth brings me closer to ecstasy. I love seeing her head bob up and down as she takes me deeper with each pass. She uses her hand to grasp the void space and it glides up and down in perfect rhythm with her mouth. She does this motion over and over until I feel it building and I\u0027m ready to blow.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting close,\" I warn her because it always needs to be her decision if I come in her mouth.\\n\\n Like always, she doesn\u0027t stop and I can\u0027t believe how lucky I am to have a girl who does any of this for me. She is so fucking hot!\\n\\n I try to hold back so I can make it last longer, but I\u0027m a goner when she squeezes her hand tighter around the base. I flex upward into her mouth and her hands move to wrap around my hips as she gives me one last hard suck. I place my head against the back of the couch and look up at the ceiling. \"You are my dream come true.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s how I stay for several seconds before I lift my head to see her sitting at my feet, her chin resting on my leg as she looks up at me. \"I love seeing you come apart like that. It\u0027s amazing to know I\u0027m able to do that to you.\"\\n\\n I place my hand on the side of her face and rub my thumb over her bruised cheekbone. \"You\u0027re the only one who can.\"\\n\\n She turns her face toward my palm and places her hand on top of mine. \"I think I owed you that after you handled Jolie so well. I know that wasn\u0027t easy for you.\"\\n\\n There\u0027s so much more. \"Baby, you don\u0027t know the half of it.\"\\n\\n \"What else did she do?\"\\n\\n \"She cornered me in the dining room while you were in the kitchen.\"\\n\\n \"What did she say?\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t really even want to go there because I\u0027m afraid Laurelyn might begin to think about it and find some merit in her mum\u0027s words, but I tell her out of my own selfishness because I want to see her reaction. I\u0027ve dropped hints here and there, but we\u0027ve yet to talk about any kind of future together. I hope to read her face for some sign of how she feels about leaving her new successful life. \"She told me I\u0027d be robbing you of great opportunities if I took you away from your career.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, God.\"\\n\\n \"You know I\u0027m not that person. I want you to have everything you\u0027ve dreamed of.\"\\n\\n \"There are two things I dream of, and having one means I don\u0027t get to have the other.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m gonna put it out there. \"The selfish part of me wants to tell you to quit this thing you\u0027re doing and come back with me, but I won\u0027t. It has to be a decision you make on your own. I couldn\u0027t take it if years down the road, you blamed me for robbing you of this life.\"\\n\\n \"And I want to tell you to sell everything and come here to build a life with me, but I understand how leaving behind the vineyards you know for the unknown could be disastrous for your livelihood. You\u0027ve worked too hard to give up all of your success, and I could never ask you to move away from your family. So, where does that leave us? Where do we go from here?\"\\n\\n \"I have no idea. I only know that I want you more than anything I\u0027ve ever wanted in my life.\"\\n\\n \"Ditto.\" She kisses my leg. \"I wish we weren\u0027t so complicated.\" As soon as the word complicated leaves her mouth, we both laugh. \"I know. Complication is exactly what you wanted to avoid and look at what it\u0027s done to your life.\"\\n\\n I hope she\u0027s not suggesting we would\u0027ve been better off not knowing one another because nothing could be further from the truth. \"Come here, love.\"\\n\\n She gets up from the floor and straddles me. I take her face in my hands and hold it so she\u0027s eye to eye with me. \"I don\u0027t regret you for a second. You\u0027re my favorite complication and you always will be.\" I see the tears forming in her eyes as they begin to glass. \"I knew you were the next one the second I laid my eyes on you singing in that club, but you can never imagine my surprise when I realized that you weren\u0027t just the next one—you were the last one.\"\\n\\n Chapter Nineteen\\n\\n He has no idea what it does to me when he says things like that. It tears my heart in two. I know I love him and I want to be with him more than anything in this world, but then I have this life I\u0027ve only barely tasted. What if I give it up and then we don\u0027t work out? Where would I be then?\\n\\n Alone without a career. I\u0027ve been there and done that, and it was terrible. I\u0027m terrified of finding myself in that predicament again.\\n\\n My heart is racing. I know he wants me to tell him I\u0027ll walk away from all this and go back with him, but I can\u0027t. \"I\u0027m scared. Terrified is actually a better word. I wish I weren\u0027t, but I\u0027m the only person in my life who\u0027s ever had my back. This is my way of surviving—to put trust in someone besides myself is to become vulnerable. I\u0027ve never allowed myself to do that. I\u0027m just messed up that way and I\u0027m not sure I can ever be any different.\"\\n\\n \"I know you can. I saw your vulnerability when you told me you loved me for the first time. You broke through those walls you\u0027d built but I let you down. And even though you love me, you\u0027re not ready to trust me wholeheartedly again. But it\u0027s okay because I\u0027m going to prove that you can put all of your faith in me.\"\\n\\n I would love that so much—to have just one person I could always depend on for love and safety. And I\u0027d love nothing more than for it to be Jack Henry. \"Please don\u0027t confuse my lack of security for lack of love. I swear I couldn\u0027t love you more, but I need time.\"\\n\\n \"I want you to have everything you want. If time is what you\u0027re asking for, then I\u0027ll give you all you need.\" He pulls my face to his and kisses my mouth so gently, I almost swoon. \"I\u0027ll always give you anything you want.\"\\n\\n I feel his erection sandwiched between us and I rock my pelvis gently against it. \"Right now, there\u0027s only one thing I want, and you\u0027re definitely the only person who can give it to me.\"\\n\\n In record time, he has us moved to the floor and I\u0027m on my back with him dragging my jeans and panties down my legs. He\u0027s merciless when he drives into me so hard, my back skids across the carpet. \"Sorry,\" he apologizes but doesn\u0027t relent as he pounds inside me. I\u0027m propelled further across the floor with each thrust.\\n\\n I loop my arms around him to hold on. \"Never be sorry for fucking me this good.\"\\n\\n \"God, you\u0027re gonna get carpet burn if I keep on like this.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s up from the floor and pulling me with him. He lifts me and deposits my bottom on the arm of the couch. I fall backwards on the cushions before I lift my feet to his shoulders and he\u0027s at it again. Damn. I\u0027m getting fucked while practically standing on my head, and it\u0027s pretty superb.\\n\\n I should be willing to walk away from my life just so I can have this done to me every day. It\u0027s definitely something to consider.\\n\\n He wraps his hands around my thighs and pulls me up to him as he drives harder with each thrust. \"I meant what I said. I swear you are my fucking dream come true.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s amazing how he can take the sweetest things, throw the word \"fucking\" in the middle of it, and I could melt into a puddle at his feet. If my panties weren\u0027t already off, I\u0027d be dropping them after hearing him say that.\\n\\n I don\u0027t have time to think of a witty response because he\u0027s thrusting into me those last few times. \"There\u0027s nothing I love more than being inside you, Miss McLachlan.\"\\n\\n Okay, that\u0027s a little different. Usually he just groans my name. This time I get a complete sentence, ending with \"Miss McLachlan.\"\\n\\n When he\u0027s finished coming, I slide up the couch and he sinks over on top of me with his body settled between my thighs. \"I swear you don\u0027t miss an opportunity to get between my legs.\"\\n\\n \"No, I certainly do not, and that won\u0027t be changing any time soon.\" He reaches down and grins mischievously as he cups his hand over me. \"This is where I love to be.\"\\n\\n I slap his hand away because sometimes a girl just needs a little break. \"You are an animal.\"\\n\\n \"And you love it.\"\\n\\n He always says that. And it\u0027s true. \"Yeah, I do.\"\\n\\n \"We have six days to ourselves before you\u0027re scheduled back in the studio. Do you want to do something special?\"\\n\\n I\u0027m always up for anything, special or not, with him. \"What do you have in mind?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe take a trip somewhere?\"\\n\\n I\u0027ve been away from home for so long. I\u0027d like to spend some time here instead of being gone all week. \"Maybe if it was a short trip—no more than three days.\"\\n\\n \"What about Vegas?\"\\n\\n I like the thought of a little fun at the casinos. \"I could handle a little R and R. Maybe do some gambling. See a show.\"\\n\\n \"What day works for you?\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t want to come back and have to roll into rehearsals the next day. \"Can we do it soon so I can have a few days to rest before I have to be back in the studio? It\u0027s going to be hell on wheels once we start this new material.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-27.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \\n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \\n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
