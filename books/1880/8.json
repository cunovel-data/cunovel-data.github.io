He should at least have the decency to give you back your songs.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t see the fury on his face. \"That\u0027s not going to happen, but it\u0027s okay. Really. He can hold my songs hostage if he wants. I still own half so he can\u0027t give them to anyone else. And I have new material that\u0027s way better than any of my old stuff.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because all of them are about him.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t have to ask whom she\u0027s referring to. \"They are, but they\u0027re honest and from my heart.\"\\n\\n \"Then they\u0027ll go platinum ten times because fans know when it\u0027s real. They\u0027ll get what he means to you. I just wish he would.\"\\n\\n Me too.\\n\\n \"I have good news.\" Her words are cheerful but her voice lacks its usual pep. \"At least I hope you think it\u0027s good. I\u0027m coming home tomorrow. Cleve has an audition for me and says it\u0027s mandatory that I\u0027m back on Thursday for it.\"\\n\\n Thank goodness. I don\u0027t think I could go on being alone in the apartment. \"I\u0027m thrilled you\u0027re coming home, but you don\u0027t sound excited.\"\\n\\n \"The audition is with a band and I won\u0027t be lead vocalist.\" Not being lead could definitely be a problem for Miss Front and Center. \"I\u0027ll have to share it with a dude.\"\\n\\n \"Those kinds of bands are doing really well in country right now. It\u0027s sounds like a great opportunity,\" I encourage. \"Would I know them?\"\\n\\n \"Southern Ophelia.\"\\n\\n \"Damn, Addie. They\u0027re hot right now. Like, really hot. I can\u0027t believe one of their vocalists walked away in the middle of all that success. That\u0027s crazy.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, but it\u0027s not what I want because it\u0027s not my style. I just don\u0027t see me being happy with sharing the spotlight. You know I love being the center of attention. It sounds like a great gig, but the whole thing is so rushed. Heather quit last week and they\u0027re scheduled to cut an album next month, so it won\u0027t give us long to mesh. After that, we\u0027d be hitting the road for six months to promote the album.\"\\n\\n Addison was no spotlight sharer, but Cleve was right in thinking this was a good move for her. As such, it was my job to encourage her. \"Addie, that sounds like exactly the opportunity you need to give your career a huge jumpstart. Cutting an album and going on the road—that\u0027s huge. And who knows? You could love singing with a guy.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m gonna hate it. I just know it.\"\\n\\n Always the pessimist. \"There are worse things.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Laurie,\" she apologizes. \"It\u0027s really insensitive of me to be whining to you after what happened with Blake.\"\\n\\n Frankly, I\u0027m a little shocked by her consideration. Her relationship with Zac seems to have changed her in a very positive way. \"It\u0027s sucks but I\u0027ll be okay.\"\\n\\n \"I know, but I haven\u0027t been very considerate of your feelings. I\u0027ve been a shitty friend and I\u0027m sorry. I swear I\u0027m gonna make it up to you.\"\\n\\n I accept Addison the way she is and I don\u0027t expect her to make anything up to me. \"You haven\u0027t been a shitty friend. You\u0027ve called every day—sometimes twice—to make sure I\u0027m okay.\"\\n\\n \"We both know I could do a lot better.\"\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t the only one who could improve. \"I\u0027m the one who moved out on you to live with a man I barely knew.\"\\n\\n \"Because of what my brother did to you. And I took his side. I\u0027m so sorry.\"\\n\\n Agreed. She definitely should\u0027ve supported me more on that. \"It\u0027s okay. It all worked out for the best. Living with Ja…Lachlan for those two and a half months was the best experience of my life.\"\\n\\n \"How are we ever gonna get over those Aussie men?\"\\n\\n \"I have no idea, Addie.\" And that is the honest-to-God truth. I don\u0027t know how I\u0027ll ever be able to give up the love of my life.\\n\\n I\u0027m helping Addison sort her laundry—all humpteen bags full—when I see her take a gift bag from her suitcase. \"I bought something for you while I was in Cali—not that you couldn\u0027t get them here—but I knew it was something you wouldn\u0027t buy for yourself.\"\\n\\n Some people are natural-born gift givers. They love giving because it makes them feel good. But Addison isn\u0027t one of them, so I\u0027m interested in seeing what would spurn spontaneous gift-buying. \"You didn\u0027t have to get me a gift.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s beaming, so I see she\u0027s proud of herself. \"I think I did. Because I\u0027m pretty sure you need this. A lot.\"\\n\\n I take the box from the bag and instantly feel heat rise to my face. No she did not. I stare at the purple vibrator through its plastic packaging and I know that she did.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s purple—your favorite color.\" She swipes the package from my hands and takes it out when she sees I\u0027m not going to. \"This thing is fantastic, Laurie. Look what the tip can do. It swirls.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s not natural. \"I\u0027ve never seen a penis that swirls or twirls or has bright-colored beads rotating at the base.\" Of course, I\u0027ve only spent time with a couple of them, but if any man\u0027s dick did tricks, it would\u0027ve been Jack Henry\u0027s. I\u0027m sure of it. \"It looks like it has a gumball machine in it. If it starts lighting up, I gonna swear it\u0027s a kids\u0027 toy.\"\\n\\n She rolls her eyes. \"Trust me—this isn\u0027t child\u0027s play. The swirling and rotating is what makes this rock.\" She points to a phalange-looking probe thing. \"This is the magnificent part.\"\\n\\n I think I\u0027m frightened. \"What the hell is that thing?\"\\n\\n \"A clitoral stimulator.\"\\n\\n Good grief. \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding me.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s laughing as she shakes her head. \"Oh, no. I would not kid of such things. This little beauty will make you come in under a minute. I guarantee it.\"\\n\\n Under a minute? Shit!\\n\\n I see an attached probe and I\u0027m scared to ask, but curiosity has set in. I touch it as I ask, \"And this?\"\\n\\n \"An anal probe.\"\\n\\n I jerk my hand back, as though the probe might have already been used. I make a face, one that tells her I\u0027m grossed out. \"I\u0027m not putting that in my ass!\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to. This baby works just fine without it. I know it\u0027s a bit much, so I bought this beginner for you also. It\u0027s called a Bullet.\" She takes out a shiny little silver gadget and places it in my hand. It looks a lot less intimidating than the purple trick penis with gumballs dancing in the shaft. The Bullet definitely seems more my speed.\\n\\n Addison has never made it a secret that she\u0027s the ultimate sex-toy expert. She\u0027s made a lot of comments in the past about how I should try them, but this is the first time she\u0027s brought me the goods. \"When you had to leave Lachlan, you gave up all those great orgasms cold turkey.\" Yup. \"You need this, Laurie. And trust me—these are the best gadgets out there.\"\\n\\n \"You would know.\"\\n\\n She points the purple vibrator at me. \"There are a lot of reasons you need this, and not all of them have to do with Lachlan.\" It\u0027s still weird hearing her call him that. \"Orgasms keep your girly parts healthy. And having an orgasm will help you sleep, which, by the looks of you, I\u0027m certain you haven\u0027t been doing.\"\\n\\n There\u0027s the old Addison. \"Thanks a lot.\"\\n\\n She shrugs, as if she can\u0027t help herself. And she probably can\u0027t. \"I\u0027m just sayin\u0027…\"\\n\\n At least she doesn\u0027t blow smoke up my ass. \"Thank goodness I can always count on you to say whatever\u0027s on your mind.\" Perhaps I\u0027m a little too sarcastic because she cuts her eyes at me.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a medically proven fact that orgasms release endorphins. That means they can help with migraines. How many did you have when you were in Australia? Migraines, I mean. Not orgasms.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t count the multitude of orgasms I had with Jack Henry if my life depended on it. \"One.\"\\n\\n \"And when did you have it?\"\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t moved in with Jack Henry yet, so it was very early during our visit. \"It wasn\u0027t long after we got there.\"\\n\\n \"See? You started having regular orgasms with Lachlan and your headaches went away.\"\\n\\n Jack Henry! Not Lachlan! I want to scream it out loud.\\n\\n But she\u0027s right. My migraines were happening increasingly more often before I went to Australia. Except for the one, they disappeared entirely while I was with him. I\u0027ve never gone that long in between occurrences. \"You\u0027re right. I didn\u0027t have another migraine after I moved in with him.\"\\n\\n \"See? Orgasms are a physical necessity and should be prescribed by your doctor for good health. There\u0027s no reason you shouldn\u0027t be having at least one a day. Personally, I recommend three. You brush your teeth three times a day to keep them healthy. Shouldn\u0027t your vagina be in tip-top shape too?\"\\n\\n Is she serious? \"You mean to tell me that you use your vibrator three times a day?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. It\u0027s been working overtime since we left Australia,\" she giggles. \"And I bought an extra just in case I wear it out. Damn, I miss Zac.\"\\n\\n Addison and I have been best friends for four years, and I\u0027ve come to know that she will never understand the concept of TMI. \"What\u0027s the plan with him?\"\\n\\n \"Girl, I\u0027m so confused about what I want. I mean, I\u0027m not confused about wanting him. That much I know. I\u0027ve never loved anyone the way I love him.\" She\u0027s biting her perfectly manicured thumbnail. It\u0027s an unfamiliar sight. \"He\u0027s asked me to come back to Australia. Indefinitely.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s crazy about him. I can\u0027t believe she hasn\u0027t hopped a plane headed back to Oz already. \"You came here to audition for this band. Does that mean you\u0027re taking the job and not going back to be with him?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m gonna do. I\u0027m not sure I can up and leave my entire life behind to move to Australia for a guy I\u0027ve known three months. That\u0027s crazy talk, right? My whole life is in the U.S. My parents. My career. You.\" She looks as though she might burst into tears. \"What would you do?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-8.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \\n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \\n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
