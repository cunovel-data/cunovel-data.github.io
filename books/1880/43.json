I see something in his eyes for the first time. I think it\u0027s fear and it most definitely has a basis for being there. He should be afraid because all I can see is red.\\n\\n \"Get me out of here.\" I owe Margaret some kind of apology. \"I\u0027m so sorry for ruining dinner, but I need to go home and lie down. Please tell everyone I apologize for the drama. I hope I haven\u0027t ruined the night for them.\"\\n\\n She places her hands on my face and searches my eyes. I\u0027m certain she\u0027s confused about what\u0027s just happened. \"You haven\u0027t ruined anything, sweetheart. You just go with Jack Henry and feel better soon.\"\\n\\n Fat chance of that happening.\\n\\n She hugs me tightly. \"Thank you, Margaret. It was a lovely dinner.\"\\n\\n She releases me. \"I\u0027ll call in the morning to check on you. If you need anything—I mean anything at all—don\u0027t hesitate to call.\"\\n\\n \"I will. Promise.\"\\n\\n I allow Jack Henry to support me by my upper arm as we walk out of the restaurant. He might take my tolerance as a sign of concession, but it\u0027s anything but. This is far from over. Once we\u0027re in the parking lot out of the family\u0027s sight, I jerk my arm from his grasp. \"Take your fucking hands off of me.\"\\n\\n \"Baby…\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you dare baby me. You don\u0027t get to baby me after fucking that woman and then lying to me about it.\"\\n\\n \"Please, let me…\"\\n\\n I cut him off. \"Explain? No. I don\u0027t want to hear your account of what happened. I heard hers and right now I have a whole lot more faith in her ability to tell the truth.\"\\n\\n \"It didn\u0027t happen the way you think.\"\\n\\n My finger is in his face. \"Shut. Your. Fucking. Mouth. I don\u0027t want to hear a word out of you.\" I stand there debating if I\u0027ll get in the car with him, but who am I kidding? I don\u0027t have much of a choice since I have nowhere else to go. \"Take me to the apartment.\"\\n\\n We remain silent as he drives. I stare out the window watching the streetlights zoom by. I\u0027m grateful he doesn\u0027t make another attempt to explain his actions away because I can\u0027t take talking or thinking about him being with another woman right now.\\n\\n I feel the slight throb of a migraine beginning at the base of my head. It\u0027s been months since I had one, but I\u0027m not shocked to feel it coming on after what just happened. I know this process well and it\u0027s going to get worse until it becomes so painful, I have no choice but to get sick. Perfect. It\u0027s exactly what I need on top of this shit.\\n\\n The flashing of the streetlights is making it worse, so I close my eyes and lean my head back against the seat. By the time we pull into the garage, I\u0027m in a massive amount of pain and highly nauseated. I reach for the handle and get out of the car so I don\u0027t spew in the Sunset. That would be a total shame.\\n\\n Jack Henry unlocks the door and walks in first. Home is the only place he enters ahead of me. It\u0027s his routine and he does it to protect me in case we were to walk in on a burglary.\\n\\n He tosses the keys onto the kitchen counter and then turns to me. \"We have to talk about this.\"\\n\\n I run past him toward our bathroom. I slam the door and barely make it to the toilet before I vomit. I see the door open in my peripheral vision and he comes in without an invitation. \"Go away,\" I order, although I know it\u0027s in vain. He\u0027s never gone away before and I know he won\u0027t now.\\n\\n I hear him turn on the faucet and seconds later, I feel him twist my hair up and off my neck so he can place a cool, wet washcloth against my skin. \"Maybe this will help.\"\\n\\n \"There isn\u0027t help for what I\u0027m feeling.\"\\n\\n \"Laurelyn, please let me tell you what happened.\"\\n\\n \"Seriously?\" I scream and it makes my head pound even harder. \"My head is hanging over the toilet because I\u0027m puking up my guts, and you want to talk about being with another woman.\"\\n\\n He says nothing and walks out of the bathroom. He returns a few minutes later with one of his T-shirts thrown over his shoulder. \"I\u0027m going to help you change and you\u0027re going to let me because you need my help.\"\\n\\n I give him a look that warns him he better not try anything. \"I don\u0027t want to die tonight, Laurelyn. I only want to help you change your clothes.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m still on my knees when I feel my zipper slide down my back to my hips. He helps me stand and my black sheath dress puddles at my feet around my black Italian open-toed pumps that cost a ridiculous sum. I hold his shoulder as I step out of my dress and he moves it from where it fell on the floor.\\n\\n I see his eyes studying my black lace bra, matching panties, and garter belt as I stand in my five-inch heels. I know Jack Henry well, and it pleases me to no end to know seeing me like this is probably giving him a raging hard-on with no relief from me in the near future.\\n\\n I reach behind my back to unfasten my bra and let it fall to the floor. I unhook my nylons and remove them before I slide the belt down my legs. I\u0027m standing in my panties and he studies my near-naked body briefly before taking the shirt from his shoulder and pulling it over my head. \"I\u0027ll have your side of the bed turned back for you when you\u0027re finished in here.\"\\n\\n When I come out of the bathroom, the lights are off with the exception of the bedside lamp. There\u0027s a glass of water and a pill I recognize as my migraine medication on the nightstand. Jack Henry isn\u0027t anywhere in sight, so I take the small white tablet and crawl into bed.\\n\\n Lying in bed without him could never feel lonelier, but he\u0027s wise to give me my space. I\u0027m like an unstable explosive threatening to detonate at any moment.\\n\\n The clock tells me it\u0027s been an hour since I took my medication, so I know sleep will claim me soon. I\u0027m already feeling the drug-induced drowsiness it always brings and I welcome it. I need an escape from this cruel reality.\\n\\n It\u0027s still dark when I open my eyes, so I know I didn\u0027t sleep long. The clock glows 3:39 in the blackness around me and I reach over to find Jack Henry\u0027s side of the bed empty. Smart man.\\n\\n I shouldn\u0027t care where he\u0027s bedded down for the night—but I do—so I slide out of bed and go in search. I don\u0027t find him in the guest bedrooms, so I go to the living room and he\u0027s sleeping in a sitting position on the couch with a glass of dark amber liquid in his hand. There\u0027s fresh ice in his drink, so I know he hasn\u0027t been asleep for long.\\n\\n It isn\u0027t often that I\u0027m able to study his figure while he sleeps, but I come to the same conclusion every time: he\u0027s the most beautiful man I\u0027ve ever seen. And I love him so much it hurts.\\n\\n He stirs in his sleep and his drink tilts to the side, causing some of it to spill down his leg. I reach to take it from his hand and he startles awake. I unwrap his fingers from it. \"You can let go. I\u0027ve got it.\"\\n\\n He stares at me with hazy eyes and I realize he\u0027s shitfaced when he reaches out to grab me a little too hard around the waist. He leans forward and presses his head to my stomach, causing me to stagger backward to maintain my balance. \"I love you, Laurelyn. Please, don\u0027t leave me. I\u0027ll fucking die if you do.\"\\n\\n I love him and I don\u0027t want to leave, but how can I stay with a man who would lie to my face the way he did? I asked him if he\u0027d been with another woman and he told me he hadn\u0027t been inside another one since me. I gave him the perfect opportunity to come clean. It would\u0027ve hurt but I\u0027d have eventually gotten over it. At least it would\u0027ve been the truth. He knows how much I hate lies.\\n\\n I run my fingers through his dark hair. \"We\u0027ll talk about it tomorrow when you\u0027re not hammered.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s still holding me around the waist but he fists the T-shirt I\u0027m wearing and pushes it up to bare my stomach. \"I can just see you with a baby on the way.\"\\n\\n Oh, God. Why does he have to say things like that right now? \"You\u0027re drunk and you need to sleep it off.\"\\n\\n He pokes me with his finger below my navel. \"I want to marry the shit out of you and then I want to put a baby inside you as soon as you\u0027ll let me.\" He puts his finger under my piercing and flicks it up. \"But I don\u0027t know what will happen to this little jewel when your belly grows.\"\\n\\n I feel euphoric hearing him talk about marriage and babies, but then I remember why he\u0027s drunk and saying things like that. \"Be a good boy for me and lie down on the couch.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to sleep here. I want to be in our bed with you.\"\\n\\n \"No! I\u0027m pissed off at you. You\u0027re not going to sleep next to me like nothing happened.\"\\n\\n He pulls me closer and I stumble again. \"Please, Laurelyn. Let me come to bed. I don\u0027t want to sleep apart from you.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n He puts the side of his face against my stomach. \"I\u0027m begging you, baby. Don\u0027t make me sleep here without you.\"\\n\\n Shit! I\u0027m exhausted and don\u0027t have the strength to argue—or wrestle him—so I concede. \"You can come to bed but don\u0027t you dare try to touch me.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t,\" he promises. \"I just want to sleep next to you.\"\\n\\n He lets go of me and is unstable when he stands, so I reach out to steady him. \"You okay?\"\\n\\n \"Yep.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s plastered and is going to feel like shit tomorrow. Serves him right.\\n\\n \"Come on.\" Our roles have reversed. I was the unstable one earlier in the night, but now I\u0027m guiding his drunken ass down the hallway to our bedroom.\\n\\n I pull the covers back on his side of the bed and order him to climb inside. He crawls in and his eyes are shut when he says, \"I love you, Laurelyn.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m hurt by what he\u0027s done, and although I love him, I can\u0027t make myself say the words in return.\\n\\n I climb in on my side and I already hear him snoring. It\u0027s incredible but after being apart for three months, I can\u0027t even hate that annoying sound.\\n\\n When I wake again, I\u0027m lying on my side and Jack Henry\u0027s arm is around my waist. He\u0027s pressed against me and I feel his breath on the back of my neck. \"Please don\u0027t make me let you go yet. I just need to savor feeling you like this for a little longer.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-43.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \\n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \\n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
