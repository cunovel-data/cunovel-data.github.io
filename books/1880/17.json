{"id":83734,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\"I don\u0027t know. You tell me,\" she laughs as she begins kissing my mouth. When she stops, she pulls back. \"What do you think?\" \"Hmm. I think I\u0027d go with chicken cordon bleu.\" \"Funny…I was thinking jerk.\" \"Heeey!\" \"Just kidding,\" she says as she leans in for a quick kiss. \"Be right back.\" I put my hands behind my head and my eyes soak up every inch of Laurelyn\u0027s beautiful naked body as she leaves the bed. I don\u0027t know how I\u0027m lucky enough to love this beautiful woman and have her love me back. I never dreamed something so wonderful could be possible. I\u0027m in the middle of enjoying my euphoria when I hear a sound that doesn\u0027t belong to my phone, so I can only assume it\u0027s Laurelyn\u0027s. It\u0027s six o\u0027clock and now I\u0027m the one wondering who would be contacting her at this time of morning. I admit I debate grabbing her phone from the nightstand to see who it is and what it says, but I don\u0027t. Instead I tell her about it when she returns to bed. She doesn\u0027t hesitate in reaching for it. She chews her bottom lip as she reads it and I remember that being something she did when she was perplexed. \"It\u0027s from Charlie.\" Great. Another man who\u0027s going to try to come between me and this woman I love. \"He says the bus is leaving at eight instead of nine.\" Suddenly, there\u0027s a huge elephant sitting in the bed between us. We both know the bus leaving means it will take her away from me. We\u0027re finally together after all this time and we\u0027ve admitted how much we love each other, but there are all these complications we haven\u0027t had time to discuss. We have completely different lives, with so much distance between, and I have to wonder where I fit into all this. There\u0027s one thing I know for certain. \"I just found you and I\u0027m not ready to let you go.\" She tosses her phone on the bed. \"I don\u0027t want to go, either, but I don\u0027t have a choice. We have a show in Austin tonight and the band is depending on me.\" I rack my brain for a solution, even if it\u0027s only a temporary one. \"You don\u0027t have to ride with them. I\u0027ll hire a driver with a limo to get us where you need to be.\" She doesn\u0027t hesitate. \"Okay, but all my stuff is on the bus. I need clothes, so I have to run down there before it leaves.\" \"Sure. How far is Austin from Dallas?\" \"Umm…probably three hours or so,\" she says. \"And what time is your show?\" \"I think it\u0027s at eight.\" She picks up her phone and then confirms, \"Yeah. Eight o\u0027clock.\" I\u0027m doing the math in my head. \"You have a show in fourteen hours and it\u0027s a three-hour drive to get you there. I should probably factor in an hour for you to get ready and another hour for you to be there early. If I give you thirty minutes to get down to the bus and back, that should give us at least seven hours in this hotel suite before we have to leave.\" She grins as she leans over to kiss me. \"What in the world could we possibly do for seven hours in this suite with a king-sized bed and our choice of enormous tub or gigantic shower?\" I pull her over on top of me. \"We\u0027re gonna continue making up for lost time, but seven hours won\u0027t come close to covering it, so we\u0027ll pick up again after your show tonight.\" \"I can\u0027t think of anything I\u0027d rather do.\" \"I\u0027ll order room service and have breakfast waiting when you return. You want your usual? An omelet and orange juice?\" Her pleased expression tells me she likes that I remember her favorite breakfast. \"Yeah. I\u0027ll take my usual. Although I\u0027ve yet to find an omelet as good as Mrs. Porcelli\u0027s.\" \"And you won\u0027t until you\u0027re back in Australia with me.\" There it is—a huge complication we\u0027ll have to tackle at some point. But not now. I change the subject quickly. I don\u0027t want her to put too much thought into my statement before we\u0027re able to discuss our plans for the future. \"The quicker you get down to that bus, the quicker you\u0027ll get back so we can start on our seven-hour marathon.\" \"Then I\u0027d better hurry.\" Chapter Eleven Seven hours. I thought it couldn\u0027t be done—and it probably couldn\u0027t with any other man—but who was I kidding? This is Jack Henry we\u0027re talking about. The man is an absolute sex machine. Hmm, lucky me. It\u0027s crazy. We\u0027re riding in the back of the limo on the way to Austin after a seven-hour sex-a-thon and my thirst for him is no more quenched than it was when I rode that elevator up to his suite last night. This man can make me want him just by breathing. I try to distract myself with conversation. \"Addison called this morning when I went to get my things from the bus. I told her the whole story about us—you and me. She wasn\u0027t happy that I\u0027d kept it from her all this time.\" Saying she wasn\u0027t happy is minimizing her reaction. She was downright pissed off. \"She\u0027s your best friend. I would be worried if she weren\u0027t upset.\" \"She\u0027s in Wagga Wagga with Zac. Did you know that?\" He turns his head briskly to look at me. \"Addison Donavon is in Wagga Wagga,\" he laughs. \"I guess that explains why Jim couldn\u0027t find her in the U.S. Incredible. She was in the same town as me all that time.\" He seems to be thinking about something. \"It nearly killed me but I went to Ben\u0027s apartment to beg him for information about you after you were gone. He took great pleasure in withholding those details.\" \"I\u0027m sorry Ben was such an ass.\" \"It\u0027s okay,\" he laughs. \"I had an opportunity to see him again. He applied for an internship at Avalon and I took great pleasure in telling him to fuck off. You can\u0027t imagine the shock on his face when he walked into my office with his résumé in hand. It was priceless.\" \"I bet he could\u0027ve shit his pants. You should hire Zac. Addison told me he hadn\u0027t found an internship yet. They finished in the middle of the school year so all of the positions are taken by the previous class.\" \"I will if it\u0027s what you want.\" He\u0027s holding my hand and his thumb is rubbing the top of mine. \"I\u0027ll do anything you ask of me.\" I watch as it slowly moves back and forth across my skin, and I\u0027m reminded of where it was earlier as it performed a very similar motion. The memory ignites sparks that travel up my arm and down to the core of my groin. I press my legs together and wiggle in my seat to try to relieve the increasing desire, but it\u0027s useless. There\u0027s only one fix for it. The sweet, seductive sound of \"Don\u0027t Forget to Breathe\" by Bitter:sweet begins playing and it only adds to my escalating arousal. Jack Henry takes notice of my growing restlessness. \"Baby, are you all right? Do you need the driver to stop?\" The bathroom is not what I need right now. I\u0027m embarrassed to admit that we made love all day and I still want him. That can\u0027t be normal. I swallow and clear my throat before I croak out, \"I\u0027m fine.\" I try to remain motionless, but it\u0027s one of those sensations where it feels like I have an itch and I\u0027ll lose my mind if I don\u0027t scratch it. He relinquishes hold of my hand and places it on my bare thigh to comfort me, not knowing it\u0027s like an accelerant being tossed onto a wildfire. \"You\u0027re so on edge that you can\u0027t sit still for two seconds. I\u0027m sorry if you\u0027re sore because of me.\" I am a little tender but it has no bearing on the other thing I\u0027m feeling right now. \"I\u0027m not sorry.\" I study the divider between the driver and us. \"He can\u0027t see us at all?\" I think Jack Henry could be catching on. He grins as he answers, \"No, not with the divider up.\" \"And he can\u0027t hear us?\" He\u0027s definitely catching on to where I\u0027m going with this, judging by his face. \"Not unless you scream.\" \"You\u0027ve been known to do that to me.\" I\u0027m taunting him and we both know it. \"Only because it\u0027s what you wanted.\" I put my hand on his thigh and begin massaging the muscle beneath his jeans. \"That\u0027s true. It\u0027s what I always want.\" I lean over to press my lips against the side of his neck below his ear and kiss that special place that drives him crazy. I move my hand up his leg and when I feel how hard he is already, I migrate my mouth upward and hover over his ear, whispering breathlessly, \"I\u0027m going to take off all of my clothes and when I\u0027m finished, I want you to fuck me until I come.\" \"Anything you say.\" I drag my finger over his bottom lip. \"That\u0027s my good boy.\" I increase the music\u0027s volume and unfasten my seatbelt so I can begin the show. I might not have a pole in the back of this limo, but it won\u0027t keep me from giving Jack Henry one hell of a performance. I twist so I\u0027m facing him and reach into my hair to pull out the pins holding it in place. I shake my head as it falls and fluff it with my hands. I just screwed it up for tonight\u0027s show but that\u0027s not the one I\u0027m concerned with at the moment. \"You have beautiful hair.\" He reaches for a lock and I smile as I scoot away from him. There will be no show if he touches me while I\u0027m stripping. \"No touching the back-seat stripper.\" \"Back-seat stripper, huh?\" I wiggle out of my denim jacket and begin to unfasten the buttons on my ivory sleeveless top. He watches as each and every button reveals a little more skin. I do it slowly to tease him while it builds his anticipation for what awaits him beneath the soft cotton of my shirt. I regret that the bra and panties are simple white lace, but I never expected to have a need for sexy lingerie while on tour. Sex was the last thing I thought I\u0027d be having while traveling from town to town, so I\u0027m lucky I managed to have this matching set. Note to self: make a lingerie run ASAP. I remain out of his reach on the other side of the car as I peel my shirt back and drop it to the limo floor. I reach into the elastic waist of my skirt and panties to slide both down my hips until they puddle at my feet around my boots. I slip each off, one at a time, and then add them to my growing collection of clothes on the floorboard.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-17.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
