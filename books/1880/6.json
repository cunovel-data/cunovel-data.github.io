{"id":83723,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\"I\u0027m not sick, Mom.\" \"Then, what has happened to you?\" I walk over and fall onto the couch next to her. I seem to have no grace these days. All I do is fall and plop. I don\u0027t know where to start with everything that\u0027s happened. My life is one big mistake after another—except for Jack Henry. He\u0027s the only thing that\u0027s been right in my life. Ever. \"I guess I should begin by telling you why I went to Australia.\" She doesn\u0027t know about my relationship with Blake. I kept him a secret from her because I knew she\u0027d discourage our relationship. She would\u0027ve told me it was a bad idea to get involved with my producer. And she\u0027d have been right. I can see that she\u0027s not happy when I tell her about our liaison, but she doesn\u0027t say anything, so I move straight on to my trip. And my Jack Henry. My face involuntarily smiles just by saying his name. It\u0027s impossible to not beam at the sound of it coming from my mouth. I think I see her soften as I describe the love of my life and how I feel about him. I leave off most of the details about our arrangement, except the one where we agreed our relationship was over once I left. I add a white lie and tell her the decision was based on the impossibility of a long-distance relationship rather than the fact that he never wants contact with me again. The thought brings tears to my eyes. It was so easy for him to let me walk out of his life. I told him I loved him and he couldn\u0027t tell me the same. Because he didn\u0027t want me. When I finish giving her the PG version of my time with Jack Henry, I move on to my meeting with David and Blake. She seems pleased with what I\u0027m saying, but then it all comes to a screeching halt when I get to the part where I undescended Blake\u0027s testicles for him. I get up from the couch and pace the floor. I totally expect her reprimand for my actions—the ones that will likely kill my career—but she surprises me. \"That bastard threatened to ruin your career while he pinned you to your car? Kicking him in the nuts is the least of what he deserves to have done to him. What he tried to do to you is blackmail, which is illegal, so don\u0027t you worry about a thing. We\u0027ll take care of this.\" Who\u0027s we? Is she referring to me and her, or her and the sperm donor? I suddenly hear a man\u0027s voice, and it\u0027s angry. \"Who pinned you against your car and threatened to ruin your career?\" I jump from the sovereignty in the voice. When I look toward the commanding speaker, I see Jake Beckett standing in the doorway. I know my eyes must be huge by the bizarre way he\u0027s looking back at me. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to scare you.\" I don\u0027t say anything as he cautiously walks toward me, like I\u0027m a skittish animal ready to run at any moment. He doesn\u0027t take his eyes from me, staring at my face. He looks mesmerized. As badly as I want to, I can\u0027t take my eyes from his, either. It\u0027s like staring into a mirror. I never knew we were this similar. He reaches out to place his hands on each side of my face. My initial reaction is to pull away, but I can\u0027t. I crave this man\u0027s affectionate touch for a reason I can\u0027t identify. \"My God, you look just like my sister. It\u0027s amazing.\" I\u0027ve spent most of my life hating this man for what he did to my mother and me. He got her pregnant while he was married to another woman and then pretended we didn\u0027t exist. He threw us away like trash. I hate him for it and every moment he could\u0027ve made my life easier but chose not to. I hate you. The words dance on the tip of my tongue. I want to say them—or maybe scream them—so I can see the look on his face. I want to hurt him the way he\u0027s hurt me all of these years. When he finishes looking at me, he takes his hands away and uses them to pull me into a tight embrace. My face is pressed into his shoulder but it doesn\u0027t stop the words I\u0027m determined to say. \"I hate you,\" I weakly whisper as I halfheartedly push against him, but he only grips me tighter. \"You can tell me you hate me as much as you like, but it won\u0027t change how much I love you, Laurelyn.\" I want to tell him how painful it\u0027s been to feel unloved and unwanted by him my whole life and how it directly affects the way I view every man I interact with. Instead, I\u0027m shocked by what I\u0027m feeling. This isn\u0027t at all the reunion I\u0027d planned in my head. All the years of anger I\u0027ve felt for this man melt away because he\u0027s my father and he\u0027s holding me for the first time. I regress to that little girl who dreamed and prayed he\u0027d want me because I was worth loving. \"I can never tell you how sorry I am for being absent from your life. But I promise you that it will never happen again. The world is going to know that you\u0027re my daughter because I love you.\" I never needed the world to know I was Jake Beckett\u0027s daughter. And I sure don\u0027t need them to know now. I don\u0027t want his free pass into the music industry. \"No. I don\u0027t want anyone to know.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t. Most people wouldn\u0027t. \"I don\u0027t want my success based on the fact that I\u0027m Jake Beckett\u0027s daughter. I want to make it because I\u0027m a damn good musician. If you announce that you\u0027re my father, I\u0027ll never know if I was good enough to succeed on my own.\" I can tell he doesn\u0027t like it, but that\u0027s really too bad. \"I\u0027ll do whatever you want, Laurelyn. Just promise me I can announce it after you\u0027ve proven yourself.\" I\u0027m not in a place where I\u0027m anxious to make promises. \"Let me make it first, and then we\u0027ll go from there.\" Chapter Four I\u0027ve spent the last week at my apartment in Sydney because I thought I\u0027d lose my mind if I stayed another day at Avalon. Laurelyn\u0027s memory haunts me every place I look. There isn\u0027t a place on the vineyard that I don\u0027t see her, but my bed is the worst. I won\u0027t let Mrs. Porcelli wash the sheets because I want to lie in them and still smell Laurelyn next to me. How desperate is that? My decision to come to Sydney was ultimately a good one. Although the whole number-fourteen thing was a huge mistake, it opened my eyes to what needed to be done, so I can\u0027t regret it in that aspect. But in every other way, it was the stupidest decision I\u0027d ever made. I don\u0027t know why I thought anything could drive Laurelyn out of my head. Amnesia couldn\u0027t erase her from my brain. She\u0027s etched there forever. My time hiding out at my apartment has come to an end. It\u0027s time for me to return to Avalon. I can\u0027t neglect the vineyard during the harvest any longer. I\u0027m almost ready to leave when my phone rings, my brother\u0027s name on the screen. It\u0027s early yet. I immediately worry something has happened to Dad because Evan would never call me so early otherwise. \"What is it?\" \"Nothing\u0027s wrong. I, uh…was just wondering if I could come by and talk to you for a minute before I go to work?\" This is strange—not like my brother at all. And he doesn\u0027t have to be at work until much later, so I know something\u0027s up. \"Sure.\" \"I\u0027m leaving the house now so I\u0027ll be there in about fifteen minutes.\" I take one look at Evan after he arrives and I return the compliment he gave me a week ago when he picked me up at The Langford. \"You look like shit.\" He doesn\u0027t retaliate and that\u0027s when I know that whatever is up with him is serious. \"What\u0027s going on, bro?\" \"I just need to talk to somebody.\" \"Okay. I\u0027m somebody, so shoot.\" Evan rubs his hand across his chin and that\u0027s when I notice he hasn\u0027t shaved—in a while—which isn\u0027t like him at all. But it isn\u0027t like me, either, and I\u0027m sporting the same unkempt look on my face right now. \"It\u0027s Em. She\u0027s pregnant again.\" I don\u0027t know what I was expecting, but that definitely wasn\u0027t it. From the looks of him, I thought it would be something more dire. \"Oh. Well, I guess congratulations are in order, but I\u0027m a little surprised. I didn\u0027t think you were planning on more kids.\" He laughs but doesn\u0027t appear at all amused. \"We weren\u0027t. She left her birth control pills at the house when we went away on that little weekender a couple of months ago. We thought we\u0027d be okay if she caught up on them after we got back. We were wrong.\" \"How does Em feel about it?\" \"She\u0027s happy—and already talking about it like it\u0027s a boy. She\u0027s always thought I wanted a son, but I never cared if we had one or not. I\u0027m crazy about my girls.\" He doesn\u0027t have to tell me how much he loves his daughters and Emma; they\u0027re his world. He could\u0027ve had all the money and luxuries I have, but he turned his back on it for his family. \"So you\u0027re not happy about a new baby?\" \"No, I\u0027m not. And I\u0027m a selfish motherfucker for feeling the way I do.\" He draws a deep breath and releases it slowly before he begins to pace my living room floor, hands on each side of his head. This is a new look for him and it has me worried about the reason behind his conflict. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll be able to help him, but I can listen, even if I can\u0027t offer advice. \"You can tell me what\u0027s on your mind and I won\u0027t judge you. I mean, hell…look at what I\u0027ve been up to for the last four years. It\u0027s not like I\u0027ve been tightening my halo. I\u0027m in no position to pass judgment.\" He sits on the couch and leans over, head in his hands. \"I feel like I just got Emma back. Mila has practically been attached to her tits for the past year. Twelve damn months is a long time for your wife to have a kid milking her day and night. Bro, it\u0027s the worst kind of cockblock. I feel like a bastard for wanting my kid to lay off her food source so I can get a fuck.\" Wow. Those are some words I\u0027ll never get out of my head. I could\u0027ve done without hearing that. \"Two months. That\u0027s how long Mila\u0027s been weaned, and it\u0027s been great. Both kids are out of our bed and in their own rooms. I\u0027ve finally been able to fuck my wife in our bed instead of sneaking off to do it quietly on the couch when she doesn\u0027t have a kid sucking on her like a leech. But now there\u0027s going to be another one coming along to get between us.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-6.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
