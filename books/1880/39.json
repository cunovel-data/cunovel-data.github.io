It\u0027s like my dick is trying to make up for lost time.\\n\\n I feel her hand patting me on my arm. \"Jack Henry. Stop. I have to tell you something.\"\\n\\n Stop? Is she fucking kidding me? I am like a fast-moving train without brakes. \"What is it?\" I ask as I continue moving inside her.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want to run into a problem finding a doctor down here to remove my IUD, so I had it taken out before I left.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I reply, unconcerned because I\u0027m not certain what she\u0027s talking about and I can\u0027t bring myself to care at the moment.\\n\\n She pecks me on the arm again. \"That means we\u0027re having unprotected sex right now.\"\\n\\n \"Are you telling me I gotta stop?\" I think the prospect of her saying yes has me moving even faster.\\n\\n \"No, but I\u0027m not on birth control. I was going to tell you I had condoms for us to use, but you moved so fast, I didn\u0027t get to tell you before you were inside me.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I can stop. I mean, I guess I could if I had to but…fuck…I don\u0027t want to.\" I\u0027m so close to coming and my dick isn\u0027t the least bit concerned with consequences for his actions. My head is battling my penis for dominance but right now, the one getting the action is sitting in the driver\u0027s seat and isn\u0027t prepared to move over. \"Baby, I\u0027ll quit if you want me to, but you better decide fast because I\u0027m close to blasting my swimmers into your cockpit.\"\\n\\n \"First it was a snatch and now it\u0027s a cockpit?\"\\n\\n \"You better tell me what I need to do,\" I grit through my teeth. I\u0027m trying to hold back but it\u0027s damn near impossible after going so long without having her. \"I\u0027m about to blow my load.\"\\n\\n \"Pull out and come on my stomach.\" Her words aren\u0027t spoken a second too early because as soon as I withdraw, I immediately explode all over her. \"Oh, Laurelyn…that was so…fucking…good.\"\\n\\n When I finish, I collapse to the side of her and lie on my back, looking at the ceiling. Now, I\u0027m the one with the postcoital euphoria. I catch my breath after a moment and reach for her hand to bring it up for a kiss. \"I love you, baby. I\u0027ve missed you so much and I can\u0027t tell you how happy I am to have you back here.\"\\n\\n She rolls from her back to her side and hitches her leg over me. \"I know. I feel the same. It\u0027s good to be home.\"\\n\\n \"I love hearing you say that.\" I reach for her face and pull her close for a kiss. \"Now, let\u0027s start over with this birth control conversation. I\u0027m not sure I understood a word you said.\"\\n\\n \"Did you hear the part about me not being on any?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t at first but I guess it sunk in after a minute. \"Sort of.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted the IUD removed before I left because I wasn\u0027t sure if I\u0027d have a problem finding a doctor here to take it out.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know anything about that stuff. \"We have properly trained medical doctors here. We\u0027re not barbarians.\"\\n\\n \"I know that, but we never discussed how long it would be before we wanted to start a family. I don\u0027t really know if it takes a while to conceive after an IUD is removed and I didn\u0027t want it to cause any problems when we\u0027re ready, so it seemed like the smart thing to do. I\u0027m sorry. I was going to talk to you about it, but things moved so fast. While you were proposing didn\u0027t seem like the right time to bring it up, and then your mouth was between my legs and I definitely wasn\u0027t interrupting that to talk about it. You just moved so fast. You went from having your mouth on me one second to being inside me the next.\"\\n\\n \"Baby, it\u0027s okay. If it happened, then we\u0027ll just have a baby. We\u0027re getting married soon anyway. Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not mad?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027ve told you how I feel about us having a baby. I\u0027d be happy if it happened just now. If it didn\u0027t, then that\u0027s just more time to practice until we decide to try.\"\\n\\n \"I think we\u0027re okay because I\u0027m supposed to start my period in a few days. I\u0027d be happy too if it happened, but I\u0027d prefer to be married for a little while first, if given the choice.\"\\n\\n \"Agreed.\" I roll her to her back and hold her arms above her head as I straddle her legs. \"Because I want to do all kinds of explicit things to you before we have a baby, Mrs. McLachlan.\" I lower my mouth to her breast and take her nipple in my mouth. I roll my tongue around it until it hardens. \"You know a baby would be disturbing us every few hours wanting to do this.\"\\n\\n \"You love the thought of that, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n I do, despite what Evan told me about it. \"What makes you say that?\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t the first time you\u0027ve brought up nursing.\"\\n\\n What? \"I don\u0027t remember ever talking about that.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t expect you to because you were drunk as shit—although you somehow remember the drunken proposal.\"\\n\\n \"So, I proposed while I was drunk in Vegas and talked about having kids—that you would breastfeed?\" That\u0027s weird. I must\u0027ve been drunker than I thought.\\n\\n \"Yeah, you told me you couldn\u0027t wait to see me nurse our babies.\" I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll be adding this to my list of weirdo behaviors.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember saying that, but it\u0027s true. You\u0027ve triggered something in me I thought I\u0027d never feel or desire. All I can think about is making you mine and starting a family.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because you\u0027re a caveman,\" she laughs. \"You have a desire to procreate, and I\u0027m agreeable, but you need to marry me first.\"\\n\\n No argument here. \"Just tell me when and where and I\u0027ll be there. Mum will be ecstatic to help you plan everything. She, Chloe, and Emma will probably plan the whole thing if you\u0027ll let them.\"\\n\\n \"None of my family will come, so I don\u0027t need a big wedding, unless it\u0027s what you want.\"\\n\\n It makes me sad every time she mentions that her family won\u0027t come. \"I just want you. I don\u0027t need anything else, but why don\u0027t we go to Sydney so you can start making plans since we don\u0027t want to wait long? Does Thursday sound okay? We\u0027ll make a long weekend of it.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. That sounds good. I can\u0027t wait to see everyone.\"\\n\\n \"Would you mind terribly if I don\u0027t tell my family you\u0027re here? I\u0027d like to surprise them. If Mum knows you\u0027re with me, she\u0027ll be on her way here within the hour, and I\u0027d like to have you to myself for a little while before the vultures descend.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m perfectly fine with a little alone time.\"\\n\\n I roll her to her back. \"Can I practice being your husband?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d be mighty disappointed if you didn\u0027t. Practice makes perfect, you know?\"\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-Nine\\n\\n I\u0027ve been in Australia for three days and Jack Henry has practiced being my husband until my stuff is tired—it\u0027s just completely worn out. I didn\u0027t think it could be done, but I was wrong. I guess that\u0027s what happens when you try to make up for three months in a seventy-two-hour time frame.\\n\\n I think I\u0027m grateful for the five-hour drive so I can have a break from our almost nonstop sex. He won\u0027t admit it, but I think Jack Henry may have had enough for a while too.\\n\\n We go to his apartment before driving out to his parents\u0027. The place seems so foreign to me. We didn\u0027t spend time here before because Margaret insisted we stay at her house. Just like at Avalon, right away I notice the pictures of us—and me. They\u0027re everywhere. I pick one up adorned by a heavy silver frame. In it, I look like I\u0027m daydreaming about something, completely unaware that my picture is being taken. I have no recollection of when he took it or where we were because it\u0027s a close-up and I can\u0027t make out any part of the fuzzy background.\\n\\n \"Is this from when I was in Australia before or when you were in the States with me?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s from when you were here. I have lots of pictures like that.\"\\n\\n I know he\u0027s right when I take notice of the honey highlights in my hair. I don\u0027t have those anymore, but I think I need them back. I look brighter and more cheerful with them. \"You mean pictures where I\u0027m staring off into space looking like a goofball?\"\\n\\n \"No. I mean pictures when you\u0027re natural and candid because you didn\u0027t know I was taking them. I like those best—it\u0027s how you look most of the time.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s weird to think of him taking my picture when I don\u0027t know it. \"I was already convinced but now you\u0027re a confirmed freak: ass-biter. Sweaty-back licker. Obsessed giver from behind. Sneaky photographer. What other kind of rabbits are you hiding in that hat of yours?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a long list. You make me sound like I need therapy or something.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s highly possible,\" I laugh.\\n\\n \"The only reason I\u0027d need therapy would be if I didn\u0027t have you in my life. I admit I may have bordered on the need while we were apart.\" I completely get that.\\n\\n He pulls me to him and kisses the top of my head. It\u0027s a gesture of the pure way I know he loves me—nothing sexual about it—and there\u0027s never a time when I feel more cherished than when he does this simple act. \"I love you.\"\\n\\n He squeezes me and plants another kiss on the crown of my head. \"I love you, babe—more than anyone or anything else in this world.\"\\n\\n I adore this man and I don\u0027t doubt his love. Trust doesn\u0027t come easy, but I believe him when he says he will never hurt me. My ability to feel safe enough to give myself entirely is a true miracle within itself. He has changed me—just as I have changed him. These moments mark a new beginning for us—one we will begin as husband and wife.\\n\\n Jack Henry parks in front of his parents\u0027 house, and I\u0027m anxious. I don\u0027t know why but my heart is pounding a million beats a minute. \"Why am I nervous?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, but I am too. It feels weird, doesn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Totally.\"\\n\\n He looks at the cars in the driveway. \"Everyone\u0027s here. Are you ready to make your surprise appearance?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-39.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \\n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \\n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
