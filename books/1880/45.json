Maybe I can bring her next weekend.\" That is, if she hasn\u0027t left me by then. \"Why don\u0027t you go on back and I can drive her home in a few days after we\u0027ve worn her out shopping?\" I don\u0027t think Laurelyn\u0027s gonna go for that. She isn\u0027t going to want to spend the next few days shopping for our wedding, but I don\u0027t have a reasonable excuse to give my mum. \"I\u0027ll ask her when she gets out of the shower and have her call you back.\" \"Okay.\" I end the call but dread telling Laurelyn about Mum\u0027s suggestion because I don\u0027t want to hear her response—my reality check for how she\u0027s considering calling off our wedding. I sit motionless on the bed until I hear the shower turn off. I consider knocking on the door but decide it\u0027s best if I wait until she comes out. She emerges wrapped in a towel to get her things from her bag because she doesn\u0027t have clothes here at the apartment yet. Yet. It occurs to me that after last night\u0027s encounter with that woman, she may never keep her things here. \"My mum called to check on you. She asked if I\u0027d leave you here to wedding shop while I go back to Avalon.\" She stops in front of her suitcase and looks at me. \"What did you tell her?\" \"I couldn\u0027t come up with a reason to tell her you wouldn\u0027t.\" She digs through her suitcase. \"I guess you didn\u0027t want to tell her I was having issues because you screwed around with another woman a week after I left.\" She isn\u0027t going to forgive me for this. I already know it. I\u0027ve hurt her too badly and now I fall into that category of assholes with the others—her mum, her dad, Blake. She chooses her clothes and then looks at me. \"I need my best friend right now.\" I don\u0027t know Addison well and I have no idea how she\u0027ll advise Laurelyn. I\u0027m inclined to think she won\u0027t encourage her to cut me any slack based on the brief conversation we had when she warned me about not hurting her best friend. \"I know, and I\u0027ll make it happen if that\u0027s what you want.\" \"I\u0027ll call Addison. If she\u0027s willing to come, we\u0027ll stay here instead of Avalon and I\u0027ll do the shopping thing with your family. I can\u0027t afford to lose a day of preparation if I decide to go through with marrying you.\" I cannot believe she is going to stay and continue to make plans for our wedding. Surely, that is a good sign—the first one I\u0027ve gotten. \"I\u0027ll have Daniel drive her over.\" \"I\u0027ll call Margaret and make plans for today, but I expect you to be gone when I get back.\" Damn! That was cold enough to cancel out any perceived positive vibe. \"Don\u0027t worry. I will be.\" Chapter Thirty-Three It\u0027s an utterly miserable day for me. What should be the happiest moments of my life are overshadowed by the discovery of what Jack Henry did with that woman. I can\u0027t get it out of my head because I have a face for her. I wish I didn\u0027t. Aside from crazy Audrey, I have the luxury of not knowing what the others look like, and I\u0027m fine with that. I\u0027m not naïve. I realize this will probably happen again if I marry him. I could possibly run into the others who came before me, but I\u0027m prepared to handle the priors. I can even deal with the crazy shit Audrey dishes out, but this one who came after me is a kick in the ass. And a stab in the heart. Chloe is holding two bridesmaids gowns for me to look at and I realize I completely spaced out when I hear Margaret ask, \"Honey, do you not feel well?\" No. I don\u0027t feel well at all, but it has nothing to do with being sick. I just can\u0027t handle being here picking out things for a wedding that might not happen. \"I\u0027m sorry. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m quite over that migraine. Would it be all right if we postponed today\u0027s shopping until another day? And Chloe…maybe we can do the sampling next weekend?\" \"Of course. Please don\u0027t apologize.\" She returns the dresses to the rack. \"We\u0027ll come back when you\u0027re feeling better, and it\u0027s not a problem to wait about the food. That will give me a little longer to think about the cake.\" I feel so guilty for lying to these precious women. The thought of not being Margaret\u0027s daughter-in-law, along with Chloe and Emma\u0027s sister-in-law, absolutely kills me. I almost wonder if I\u0027d marry Jack Henry just to be part of his wonderful family. I truly love them as my own—more than my own. \"I should feel better tomorrow.\" Margaret and Chloe drop me off at the apartment and Jack Henry\u0027s car isn\u0027t in the garage, so I know he\u0027s gone as I requested. Okay, demanded. At least he\u0027s smart enough to listen. I go inside and immediately see the ginormous bouquet of white roses and the letter beside them on the coffee table. I sigh, inhaling their beauty. I want to pick them up and chuck them in the trash. Or at Jack Henry\u0027s head. The latter would probably give me far more satisfaction. I hold the letter in my hands. I dread opening it. I know it\u0027s going to say things that will tear my heart out—that\u0027s the intention, right? To get me to stay and marry him. I plop down on the couch and pull out the single folded piece of paper and look at his lovely penmanship, comparable to calligraphy. It shouldn\u0027t belong to a man but it does—a beautiful one who I love. I\u0027m crying before the end of the first sentence and sobbing by the third. In my heart I know he didn\u0027t mean to hurt me, but that does nothing to stop the pain or the images I see in my head—the ones where he\u0027s in bed naked with that woman. I wish it would stop, but I don\u0027t know how to make that happen. That\u0027s how I spend the next couple of hours until Addison arrives—sitting on the couch, strumming my guitar in hopes of getting it all out of my head. \"You didn\u0027t ask me here for a girls\u0027 excursion. What\u0027s happened?\" I don\u0027t want to say the words because they\u0027re so painful, but I manage to spit them out in between my sniveling. \"There was another woman after I left.\" \"Another…companion?\" She\u0027s makes a confused face as she says the word. \"No. It wasn\u0027t like that. He was drunk and propositioned a woman about being the next one. He took her upstairs to a hotel room and got naked with her. He was going to fuck her because he said he thought it would get me out of his head.\" Addison lets that sink into her brain for several moments. \"You say he was going to. Does that mean he didn\u0027t do the deed?\" \"He says he couldn\u0027t. Because of me.\" \"Do you believe him?\" I don\u0027t have a reason not to. \"I do, but he still had the intention, even if he didn\u0027t go through with it.\" \"And this would be after you left without telling him your name or giving him a goodbye?\" I sometimes conveniently forget that part. \"Yes, but only a week later. He said he was in love with me, but I don\u0027t understand how a person goes out to find another companion to sleep with if he\u0027s so in love with me.\" I can already tell I\u0027m probably not going to like what she\u0027s about to say. That\u0027s how well I know Addison. \"I\u0027m sorry, Laurie. You know I love you and always have your back, but I can\u0027t really take your side on this one. You left Jack without telling him your name or giving him a goodbye, so I\u0027m certain he thought he\u0027d never see you again. And he wouldn\u0027t have if he hadn\u0027t hired a detective to search for you. You know I\u0027ve always said the only way to get over someone is to get under someone else. You were gone, and I think he probably was of the same mentality but couldn\u0027t go through with it. That proves way more to me than the part about him being with another woman. When faced with getting a piece of ass, he couldn\u0027t do it because of how much he loves you.\" Even if I can manage to get past that part, he didn\u0027t come clean when I flat out asked him. \"But he lied to me about it. I only found out because we ran into the woman. She cornered me in a bathroom to warn me about him. It was humiliating to stand there with his ring on my finger and have another woman tell me about going up to a hotel room with him.\" \"That\u0027s who he was—not who he is now—and it sounds like you need to decide if you can deal with what he used to do.\" She isn\u0027t getting my issue here. \"I can deal with the others but this one is different because she happened after me. It feels like our relationship is tainted.\" \"Think about this. I know you had a little something trying to get started with Charlie when Jack found you. Would you want him to hold that against you?\" It\u0027s apples and oranges. \"But that was almost three months after we were over. Not a week.\" \"You have an argument for everything I say, so I don\u0027t know what you want to hear. Do you want me to tell you to throw away everything with him because he almost screwed someone else? Think about this, Laurie. Could you really walk away from him forever, not because of something he did but because of something he almost did?\" I didn\u0027t expect her to take his side, but she\u0027s making some good arguments in his defense. \"It just hurts so much. How can I love him with all my heart but want to kick him in the nuts at the same time?\" \"It\u0027s because there are three guys in a girl\u0027s life: one she loves, one she hates, and one she can\u0027t get enough of. The three have one thing in common. They\u0027re all the same guy, and right now, Jack is the one you hate. You want to kick his nut sack into his gut, but you have to remember that he\u0027s also the one you love and can\u0027t get enough of.\" I consider Addison to be so shallow—and she can be—but not today. \"You\u0027re right. I know I\u0027d be miserable without him.\" \"You know I\u0027d tell you to drop him if he was a sleaze, but he\u0027s not. Yes, he\u0027s been a manwhore in the past, but what guy hasn\u0027t been when you really think about it? The real question here is if you can get over this and move on. Will you be able to forgive this and not hold it against him and bring it up every time you have a fight or a problem?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-45.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
