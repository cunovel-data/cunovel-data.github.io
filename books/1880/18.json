I want you wearing them while you ride me.\"\n His insinuation doesn\u0027t go unnoticed as I reach for the back of my bra. \"Anything you want.\" I\u0027m down to nothing but my boots—just the way he wants me. As I\u0027m crawling across the seat to him, he unfastens his seatbelt and slides over to meet me in the middle.\n I lift my leg and swing it over to straddle him. He grasps my naked bottom and pulls me against his raging hard-on. He grinds into me as he kisses my neck before moving to my breasts. \"Anyone who makes my fantasies come true the way you do can\u0027t be real.\"\n I take his hands and place them on my breasts. \"Everything about me is real.\"\n \"I love you, Laurelyn.\" Nothing sounds sweeter than those words.\n \"I love you too. But you\u0027re wearing way too many clothes for me to make this fantasy come true,\" I tell him as I unbutton his shirt. When it falls open, I slide my hands inside and feel his nipples harden beneath my touch.\n I glide my hands down to his jeans and give the button a pull until it\u0027s unfastened. He lifts his hips from the seat and I give his pants several good tugs until I have them down to his knees.\n I feel his erection against my stomach and I wrap my hand around it. \"I\u0027m about to make you feel so good.\" I rise up on my knees and position his tip at my wet entrance. He holds his breath with anticipation. I touch my free hand to his mouth. \"Don\u0027t forget to breathe.\"\n I feel his warm breath on my fingers and then he sucks them inside his mouth with his sharp intake of air as I slide down onto his length. \"Ohh…I don\u0027t know how you can feel so tight after everything we did earlier.\"\n I rise onto my knees until he\u0027s almost out of me before I slide back down. \"Our bodies mesh together perfectly.\"\n \"That\u0027s because you and I belong together. Always.\"\n Always. It\u0027s not a word I\u0027m used to hearing from Jack Henry, at least not in reference to our relationship, but I love the sound of it. It makes me want this man even more, so I decide the old saying is true. The brain is the biggest sex organ for a woman because hearing him say that one little word sends my body into a desperate whirlwind.\n I press my hands against the ceiling and lean back so I can slide him in deeper. It feels like I can never have him close enough. He\u0027s meeting me thrust for thrust when I feel his fingers between my legs stroking me in the most wonderful way. All of the sensations combined do me in and I feel the muscles deep within my core take over as I ride out the waves of pleasure.\n When I climax, he isn\u0027t there with me, so I move up and down faster to give him what he needs. He loops his arms under mine and hooks his hands over my shoulders. Each time I lower myself, he uses his hands to jerk me down harder as he lifts his hips. It doesn\u0027t take long before I feel him spasm inside me and know he\u0027s found his release as well.\n When we both finish coming, I don\u0027t move because these are the moments I savor—just having Jack Henry inside me without any clear line of where either of us ends or begins. These times when we\u0027re quiet and simply holding one another afterward are when I feel the closest to him.\n He puts his arms around me and pulls me close so he can place the side of his face between my breasts. \"Your heart is racing.\"\n \"As it should be after that. I think you need to travel with me to keep me in tip-top shape since I can\u0027t work out on my pole.\"\n \"Your pole at Avalon misses you. And so have I.\"\n \"I miss Avalon. It sort of felt like home to me.\"\n He lifts his face from my chest and looks up at me. \"It hasn\u0027t gone anywhere. Avalon can be your home again. With me.\"\n What is he saying? \"You want me to go back with you?\"\n \"I know it hasn\u0027t even been a full day since I walked back into your life, but having you in Australia with me is what I want more than anything.\"\n I\u0027m being pulled in two directions. This man is in my heart and that part of me wants to drop everything and board an Australia-bound plane with him right this second. But then there\u0027s another part—the one screaming at me to remember the eight years of hard work I\u0027ve invested in my music career. I\u0027m finally achieving success and it\u0027s come at a terribly high price. I\u0027m not prepared to throw my career away.\n But neither am I prepared to let Jack Henry walk out of my life. And I\u0027m afraid telling him I can\u0027t go to Australia will end with me losing him all over again. I\u0027m not sure I could survive that a second time.\n I think he sees the war raging inside me and places two fingers against my lips. \"Don\u0027t say anything yet. I don\u0027t expect you to make a decision right now. You need time to consider what moving nine thousand miles away would mean for your life—not only now, but years down the road.\"\n Last night he told me that he never wants to be apart from me again. Today he\u0027s saying we belong together. Always. It feels like he\u0027s suggesting we\u0027ll be married, but he isn\u0027t actually saying the words.\n \"I\u0027ve managed to make arrangements to be away from the vineyards for the next four weeks. I really want us to spend that time together deciding where to go from here.\"\n A whole month together. I can\u0027t imagine a better way to spend my time. \"Of course. I want to be with you every minute of the next four weeks.\"\n \"Good. I was hoping you\u0027d say that.\"\n He puts his forehead against my chest. \"We have a lot of discussions ahead of us over the next several weeks, but I won\u0027t be the one to initiate them. I\u0027ll wait for you to decide you\u0027re ready to talk.\"\n I kiss the top of his dark hair. \"Thank you for being patient with me.\"\n \"I\u0027ve known for three months I was coming for you. You\u0027ve known for a day. I realize my arrival was unanticipated and you\u0027ve been making all these plans that didn\u0027t include me showing up out of the blue.\"\n \"Jack Henry.\" I put my hands on each side of his head and force it up so I can see his face. \"Your arrival is unexpected but more than welcomed. You, caveman, are the best surprise I\u0027ve had in…my entire life.\"\n Chapter Twelve\n The driver must have sped because the limo pulls up at the hotel long before our estimated arrival, and Laurelyn\u0027s still stark naked. She scrambles for her clothes and underwear as she curses, \"Shit. We\u0027re already here and I\u0027m not wearing a stitch.\" She looks over at her reflection in the mirrored wall. \"I look like I\u0027ve been rode hard and put up wet.\"\n I can\u0027t resist. \"There\u0027s definitely been some hard riding and I must say that you were pretty wet each time.\"\n \"Not funny. The guys are going to take one look at me and know exactly what I\u0027ve been up to.\"\n I\u0027m perfectly fine with them knowing. \"I sure hope so. At least that Charlie bloke will back off.\"\n \"Charlie knows how much I love you and he\u0027s glad to see me happy—even if that means there can never be anything between us. He\u0027s that kind of guy, so please, don\u0027t give him a hard time. He\u0027s not like Ben at all.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not going to embarrass you by going all Neanderthal.\" Maybe. It might not involve me beating on my chest or dragging Laurelyn around by her hair, but I will stake my claim on my girl so there\u0027s no misunderstanding.\n \"Thank you.\"\n She takes another look at herself in the mirror and attempts to smooth her hair. \"Oh, hell. It\u0027s a good thing we\u0027re here earlier than expected because I\u0027m going to have to start from scratch.\"\n \"Baby, you look beautiful.\"\n \"This makes you happy, doesn\u0027t it? You like having me look a mess with all of my makeup rubbed off by your scruff and my hair looking like I\u0027ve been rolling around in the back seat.\"\n I playfully push her down onto the seat and lie on top of her. We\u0027re eye to eye when I tell her, \"You\u0027re damn right. I want them to know I fucked you all the way here and that my spunk is still inside you so they won\u0027t even think about trying to sniff around you.\" I reach under her skirt to rub my hand between her legs. I feel the wet spot where my load has leaked out onto her undies. \"Do you remember what I told you about this part of your body?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Say it.\" I want to hear the proof that she hasn\u0027t forgotten.\n \"No one else touches me there.\"\n I love hearing her say that. \"And why can no one else touch you like this?\"\n \"Because I\u0027m yours and no one else\u0027s.\" I covet those words from her.\n I push her knickers to the side and slip my finger inside her. \"Which makes this mine.\"\n She rolls her eyes, smiling, and that tells me that she likes the possessive nature I feel for her. \"You can be downright crude sometimes.\"\n \"But you love every dirty thing I do or say.\"\n She huffs dramatically. \"Yeah, I do. So there…I admit it. Happy now?\"\n She has no idea. \"Yes. Very.\"\n \"Good. Now, let me up because I have to go get ready for the show.\"\n I give her a peck on the mouth. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\n This venue is different from the auditorium Laurelyn and her band played last night. It looks like an old theatre, the seating a horseshoe shape and an open floor for standing room only directly in front of the stage. The crowd on the floor is growing fast, so I choose a seat on the first riser closest to the stage so I\u0027ll be able to see the show without fighting the crowd.\n It\u0027s time for the show to begin and I\u0027m amazed by the congestion of people who\u0027ve gathered to hear Southern Ophelia. These people are waiting to hear my girl sing, and it dawns on me just how fast she\u0027s risen to the top. She isn\u0027t becoming a star; she already is one.\n I\u0027m not sure where that leaves me in her life. I\u0027m certain it must\u0027ve been much easier to love me and toy with the idea of staying in Australia when she had nothing waiting on her at home, but that\u0027s not the case now. She has all of this—a band with people depending on her and a career with fans.\n I watch the floor crowd as Laurelyn and her band members perform, and something becomes very clear to me: this is still only a small portion of the stardom in her future, and it scares the hell out of me. I\u0027m terrified she\u0027ll love the glitz and glamour of this life and ultimately choose it over me. I want Laurelyn to have every bit of success she deserves because I love her, but not at the expense of our life together. That\u0027s why I must use the next month to show her why she should choose us over this life. If that makes me a selfish bastard, then it just does. I can live with that as long as she\u0027s with me and not nine thousand miles away. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-18.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
