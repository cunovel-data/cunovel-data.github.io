{"id":83764,"no":47,"title":"Page 47","content":"\n \"We\u0027re getting married tomorrow. You remember that, right?\"\n \"We have an hour until it\u0027s our wedding day and I want to spend every minute of it with you.\" Her face looks like she\u0027s considering it, so I make a move to seal the deal. \"Please, L. I\u0027ll make it worth your while, but you\u0027ll have to let me cover your mouth when I make you scream my name.\"\n She shakes her head but grins. I know that means I\u0027m good to go before she says a word. \"Get your ass in here before my mother-in-law catches you, but I\u0027m warning you now—I\u0027m screaming if you don\u0027t make this worth my while.\"\n \"Not a chance.\"\n I hoist myself up through the window and fall inside. \"Shh…they\u0027re going to hear you and come running to see what\u0027s going on.\"\n \"I\u0027m not scared,\" I boast.\n \"Yeah. And that\u0027s why you\u0027re sneaking in through the window—because you\u0027re so brave.\"\n I grab her around the waist and pull her against me. \"Stop talking and kiss me. We don\u0027t have long. We\u0027re probably down to fifty-five minutes now, and I don\u0027t know if I can do all the things I want to do in under an hour.\"\n I bring my lips to hers and she laces her fingers through the back of my hair to pull me closer. She might not say it, but she has missed being with me just as much the last few days. I can feel it in the urgency of her kiss. \"I think my girl is a little bit horny.\"\n She wastes no time working the buttons down the front of my shirt. \"I\u0027m maybe a little bit sexually frustrated. You\u0027re not the only one used to gettin\u0027 it every day.\" She gets it open and pushes it away from my shoulders until it falls to the floor. She runs her palms up my chest and then down until she\u0027s reaching for my fly. \"After all this time I should be over feeling butterflies in my stomach when we\u0027re together, but I\u0027m not and I don\u0027t think I ever will be.\"\n \"Good.\" I don\u0027t want her to ever be over it.\n I reach for my T that she\u0027s wearing and pull it over her head. \"You\u0027re wearing my shirt.\"\n \"I put it on because I wanted to smell you when I got into bed. But having the real thing here with me is so much better.\" I agree with that.\n She pushes my jeans and boxer briefs down and I kick them off the rest of the way. When I pull her close, my hard-on presses against her stomach and she brushes her fingers up and down my shaft. \"I think my boy is a little bit horny.\"\n \"Maybe I\u0027m a little bit sexually frustrated. Isn\u0027t that what you called it?\"\n I put my hands on her hips and push her knickers down her legs until she steps out of them. \"I believe I did.\" When she puts her arms up on my shoulders, I grab the backs of her thighs and lift her to wrap her legs around my waist. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever get tired of doing that.\n I carry my almost-bride to our bed and gently lower her to the mattress. I push stray hair from her face before I rain kisses over it. \"You are so beautiful. I\u0027m a lucky bastard to have you to look at the rest of my life.\"\n \"I consider myself the lucky one.\"\n I run my thumbs over her cheeks. \"I\u0027m going to spend the rest of my life proving to you that I\u0027m worthy of your love.\"\n \"You\u0027ve already proved your worthiness. That\u0027s why I\u0027m becoming your wife tomorrow.\"\n \"My wife.\" It still hasn\u0027t quite soaked in that I\u0027ll become Laurelyn\u0027s husband tomorrow. \"I love hearing you say that.\"\n I take my time kissing her mouth and then migrate down her neck to her chest, between her breasts. I palm one as I suck her hard nipple into my mouth and swipe my tongue over it. I graze the tip with my teeth and she moans as her breath increases, so I do it again because she likes it.\n I drift lower until my mouth is over her pubic arch. \"And I get to have this for the rest of my life.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you supposed to be in panic mode about never being with another woman?\"\n I\u0027ve always heard that, but it\u0027s not true. \"Never. The thought of not having you for the rest of my life is what puts me in panic mode.\"\n \"Then you should be fine because I\u0027m not going anywhere.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m going somewhere, and it\u0027s down,\" I tell her as I push her legs apart. \"That\u0027s what you want, isn\u0027t it?\"\n Her hand rests on the top of my head, stroking my hair. I laugh to myself because I know without a doubt that the gentle stroking she\u0027s doing now will soon turn into her grabbing a handful and giving it a yank. \"Yes! You have no idea how much I want your mouth on me.\"\n \"I bet I have a good idea.\"\n I drop lower and give her that one long, slow stroke up the middle. Her body jerks like she\u0027s been seared. \"You always taste so good, L. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll ever be able to get enough of you.\" She drops her legs farther apart and rocks against my mouth. I push two fingers inside her while I use my tongue to circle her most sensitive spot. She\u0027s propped on her elbows watching me and she\u0027s wearing the face—the one I see when I know I\u0027m doing everything right.\n I think she likes seeing me do this to her because it seems to be the norm these days. I still remember when she watched the first time. We were so new to each other then, and I think she was embarrassed by even the thought of it, but she did it anyway. Now, look at the little erotic vixen. She isn\u0027t afraid to tell me what she wants or needs, and I love that. It\u0027s a huge turn-on to hear her tell me how to make her come. \"Tell me what you want.\"\n She bites her bottom lip and slowly lets it slide from between her teeth. \"I want you to put the Dyson on me right here,\" she says as she touches the spot above my fingers. I love the name she has assigned to my suction move. \"And while you do that, I want your fingers sliding in and out of me but try your hand turned liked this,\" she directs as she reaches down.\n \"Anything you want, babe.\"\n I put my mouth on her and begin to slowly alternate between applying suction and releasing it as I slide my fingers in and out of her the way she wants. She beats the mattress with her hand and falls back against the bed as her legs tense. \"Damn!…Shit!\" I look up and see her grasp the sheets in her fists. \"Fuck!\" she shouts as she arches her back from the bed and her legs quiver around me. \"Ohh…ohh…I\u0027m coming.\" This is one of the rare times she doesn\u0027t yank on my hair and I\u0027m glad, judging by the force I see her using on the bed linens.\n There\u0027s no question about the moment her orgasm ends because she goes limp. I sit back on my haunches and look at her sprawled out in her exultant state. It thrills me to no end that I\u0027m able to do this for her—and that she wants me to. It\u0027s something she\u0027s come to expect, and I\u0027ll always be happy to comply.\n Her legs have slid down because she\u0027s so relaxed. I push them up until her feet are planted flat on the bed. I stay on my haunches and pull her down until our bodies meet. She moves her feet from the mattress to my shoulders and bends her knees until they\u0027re positioned firmly. Her toes dig into my skin. Huh. That\u0027s a new one. \"You must think you need to hang on.\"\n \"I\u0027m betting it\u0027s not a bad idea.\"\n There\u0027s a knock on the door and we give each other the oh-shit look but whoever it is can forget it. No way, no how am I leaving L. with this kind of hard-on.\n \"Are you okay, Laurelyn? I thought I heard you yell.\" Shit, it\u0027s my mum.\n \"I knew you\u0027d scream too loud. You were supposed to cover your mouth.\"\n \"You were supposed to cover my mouth.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s a little hard to do when my head is getting compressed between your legs.\"\n She points her finger at me and I suspect that when she opens her mouth, it\u0027s to argue but that\u0027s not what comes out. Instead she giggles, \"Yeah, you\u0027re right.\"\n \"Just a minute,\" she calls out as she streaks from the bed to grab my shirt so she can put it on. \"Go into the bathroom while I reassure Margaret that everything is okay,\" she whispers.\n \"This is ridiculous. You\u0027re going to be my wife in sixteen hours. I shouldn\u0027t have to sneak around like a teenager—especially in my own home.\"\n \"This isn\u0027t about you. It\u0027s about the idea your mother has for our perfect wedding day, so quit your whining and get your ass in there.\"\n I growl as I throw back the covers so my raging erection and I can go hide in the bathroom. She puts her finger over her mouth. \"Shh.\"\n I hide out in the bathroom for a minute before she opens the door and comes in. \"I told her I stubbed my toe and that\u0027s what the yelling was about. I\u0027m not sure she believed me. I think she may have seen your clothes scattered on the floor. If she did, we\u0027re totally busted because she knows you\u0027re entirely too anal to have left a mess like that.\"\n \"She\u0027s probably at the guest house right now checking on me.\" I lift her onto the bathroom countertop and pull her to the edge. \"She\u0027s gonna know the rooster\u0027s in the henhouse when she doesn\u0027t find me there, so we\u0027d better hurry.\"\n I push inside her and she gasps before she slaps me across my back. \"What the fuck is that for?\" I ask.\n \"You know my new birth control hasn\u0027t had time to start working and you keep doing this.\"\n I forgot. \"We both know you\u0027re the gambling kind. You like to roll the dice for your fate. I saw that when we were in Vegas.\"\n I don\u0027t stop and she doesn\u0027t make me. \"I think you\u0027re the one who likes to gamble when it comes to this.\"\n \"Maybe.\"\n I grasp her hips and pound into her with as much force as she can stand. She brings her legs up and wraps them around my waist as she leans back against the mirror. I watch my reflection give it to her and I wish she could see it because it\u0027s so damn hot.\n I pull out of her and step back. \"Get down and turn around. I want you to watch this with me.\"\n She slides off the countertop and spins around before leaning forward, just the way I want her. I place my cock at her wet entrance and I watch her eyes in the mirror as I slide inside her. I never get to see her face when I\u0027m giving it to her from behind, so this is new. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-47.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
