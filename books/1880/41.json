{"id":83758,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"\"That\u0027ll only prolong us getting home.\" \"We\u0027re in no hurry.\" He releases my hand and slides his up my skirt between my legs until he\u0027s rubbing my panties over my most sensitive spot, and I let him. \"Hmm…I thought you said this was hands-off tonight—something about me wearing out my welcome.\" His fingers feel exquisite and I\u0027m certain he can feel the moisture collecting on my underwear. \"I think someone might be changing her mind according to how wet she\u0027s getting.\" \"Maybe.\" I don\u0027t know where we are or how much longer it\u0027ll be until we\u0027re at the apartment, but unless he\u0027s parking in the garage, it\u0027s too damn far away to suit me. \"Are we almost home?\" \"No. Do I need to pull over?\" He wags his eyebrows at me. Is he completely nuts? \"You can\u0027t pull over on the side of the road for sex.\" \"Says who?\" \"I don\u0027t know who actually says it, but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s frowned upon.\" He uses his finger to push the crotch of my panties to the side. He slides his fingers up and down through the slick moisture pooling there. \"Somebody is turned on! Do you want me to pull over yet?\" I put my hands on the seat and push myself up. When I lift my bottom, he grasps the crotch of my panties and pulls them down. \"I\u0027m taking that as a yes.\" We\u0027re on what I consider a rural road. There\u0027s little to no traffic so I\u0027m not worried about being seen or disturbed. That\u0027s a good thing because in the blink of an eye, he pulls to the side of the road and slams the car into park. He opens his door and races around to my side—not what I expected at all. What is he doing? He opens my door and I\u0027m a little dumbfounded because I don\u0027t know what\u0027s on his mind. He pulls my panties down my legs and over my shoes. \"Out. Now.\" \"What are you…,\" I say before trailing off when he touches his finger to my lips. \"Shh…no talking.\" He grabs my hands and helps me out before leading me to the back of the car. He puts his hands around my waist and hoists me up onto the trunk. He slips my sandals off and places my feet on the bumper before he pushes my knees apart. \"I want to fuck on the bonnet, but it might be a little warm for that bum of yours.\" He pops his button and unzips. \"So I\u0027m gonna fuck you on the boot and save the bonnet for another time.\" Will I ever get used to these Aussie phrases? Good thing he\u0027s tall and this car is low or this wouldn\u0027t work out at all. \"You still think we\u0027re good since you\u0027re supposed to start soon?\" \"Yeah, we should be.\" I feel him at my entrance one moment and then inside me the next. I put my hands on the trunk and scoot my bottom closer to him while I lean back so he can go in deeper. He wraps his hands around my hips and holds me firm as he slams into me over and over. \"I\u0027d hate to know we conceived a baby on the trunk of the Sunset.\" \"That\u0027s what\u0027s on your mind right now? Let me give you something else to think about.\" He moves his hand from my hip to between my legs and begins to rub his thumb just above our union. \"What are you thinking about now?\" My mind quickly shifts to other thoughts. \"How good that feels and how you always make sure I get mine too.\" \"I always want to make you feel good.\" He\u0027s circling my clit slowly with the perfect amount of pressure and the tingling waves of pleasure grow in my pelvis. \"I can feel it starting.\" My legs are trembling and I lie back against the car as he does his thing. \"I\u0027m right there.\" \"Me too, babe.\" And then I squeeze my eyes shut as my body does its own magical thing. I have no control over it and it\u0027s sensational when I feel those rhythmic contractions deep inside. \"I\u0027m coming.\" As if my words trigger him, I know the moment he joins me and his body synchronizes with mine. \"I love you, L.\" L.? That\u0027s a new one but I like it. \"You sort of have to love a girl who would let you do this to her on the side of the road.\" \"I\u0027d still love you if you didn\u0027t, but I admit your ability to match me in the kink department is the icing on my cake.\" He pulls out and then slips my sandals back onto my feet before helping me down from the trunk. When we walk to the passenger side of the car, he takes my panties from where he tossed them on the seat and holds them out for me to step into. \"Do you remember the first time I did this?\" \"How could I forget? You had just spread me out on a banquet table and had your own little buffet.\" He pats my bottom when he finishes as he always does. \"That was a very good day.\" It was the beginning of us—not at all a traditional start—and what an unexpected surprise it has been to fall in love with this man. He will forever be my heart, my love, my life. How lucky am I? Chapter Thirty Laurelyn is wedding dress shopping with Mum, Emma, and Chloe, so I have the day to myself—or so I thought. Evan blames me for getting stuck taking care of the kids all day while Em is shopping for my wedding and insists I come over to help him. Little prick. Yeah, I guess I am the reason behind it, but they\u0027re his kids, not mine. I don\u0027t mind hanging out with them, though. It might be good practice and I\u0027m sure it\u0027s better to experiment on someone else\u0027s kids before ruining your own. I walk into Evan\u0027s and Aidan is throwing one hell of a fit. \"Bro, what did you do to your kid to make him scream like that?\" He gives me that look that says he\u0027d kill me if he could. \"You did this.\" Oh, hell no, I didn\u0027t. \"What did I do to make him scream like that? All I did was walk through the door.\" \"He\u0027s mad as hell because he wants Em\u0027s tits. He doesn\u0027t want to take a bottle.\" He\u0027s a McLachlan—enough said. \"I don\u0027t blame him.\" \"Shut up. I can\u0027t wait until this shit happens to you. Won\u0027t be quite so funny then, buddy.\" \"Sorry. Anything I can do to help?\" He holds a screaming Aidan out for me. \"Take him and see if you can do anything with him while I get the girls some lunch. And me too. I\u0027m starving.\" I take my screaming nephew from Evan and I have no idea what to do with him, so I sit in the recliner and begin to rock. I try his bottle again and Evan is right. He does not want an impostor. \"Little man, you\u0027re gonna get really hungry if you don\u0027t wise up and take this bottle. I\u0027m betting your buffet won\u0027t be back until late.\" I continue trying his bottle and he eventually gives in, but I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s pissed off about it. \"I get it, Aidan. You like the real thing. We all do, but you gotta cut your mum some slack.\" He finishes off the whole bottle and is asleep before I can burp him, but I prop him over my shoulder and pat his back anyway. Doesn\u0027t bother him—he\u0027s out cold and never budges. Evan\u0027s both pleased and shocked when he returns from feeding Celia and Mila. \"How the hell did you do that?\" I didn\u0027t really do anything. He caved. \"He wasn\u0027t the least bit happy about it, but he\u0027s a man. His stomach eventually won out over his anger issues.\" \"Thank God. I didn\u0027t want to listen to that all day. I was ready to send him home with you.\" Evan plops on the couch across from me. Mila crawls onto his lap. \"Is it nappy time for you now, little girl?\" She begins to twirl a lock of hair around her finger and I recognize that as her ritual for when she\u0027s sleepy. \"She has the hair-twirling thing going on. It shouldn\u0027t be long until she\u0027s knocked out. If you can get Celia down, you might have a chance at getting a break.\" \"Celia\u0027s good to go. She\u0027s watching a movie in her bedroom, so she\u0027ll be asleep in three minutes.\" Evan has this down pat. \"I don\u0027t guess I\u0027ve ever told you, but you\u0027re a great dad.\" \"Well, I never thought I could see you with kids, but I gotta admit, you look like a natural over there holding my boy.\" I like the way holding this baby makes me feel. \"If I\u0027m not a natural, I hope I\u0027m a fast learner. Laurelyn wants babies. At least two or three. Maybe more. I\u0027ll be thirty-one in a couple of months and I don\u0027t want to still be having kids when I\u0027m forty, so I figure we won\u0027t wait long before we start trying.\" Mila is already out cold but Evan continues holding her instead of putting her down on the couch. \"My brother, the rich playboy, is getting married and talking about having kids. You did it, bro. You got your cake and you get to eat it too. I\u0027m happy for you. Laurelyn\u0027s a special girl and she\u0027ll make you really happy.\" This is the first serious moment I\u0027ve shared with my brother since the day he came over and told me about Aidan coming. They\u0027re few and far between because that\u0027s not the kind of brotherhood we have, but now feels like the right time to ask him what\u0027s been on my mind. \"I need a best man. You think you\u0027re up for the job?\" \"You think I can\u0027t keep up with a ring and make a toast?\" \"I think you have the capability to do both, or I wouldn\u0027t have asked.\" \"Does this mean I\u0027m your best friend?\" He\u0027s provoking me. \"No.\" \"Yeah, it does. Say it.\" I should\u0027ve known he\u0027d pull some kind of shit like this. \"It doesn\u0027t mean anything.\" \"Say it, or I won\u0027t do it,\" he threatens. Even at twenty-eight years old, he\u0027s such a little prick. \"I have plenty of friends I could ask.\" \"But you didn\u0027t. You asked me, so admit it. I\u0027m your best friend.\" \"Yeah, you\u0027re my best friend. Happy?\" I feel defeated. \"Yeah, BFF,\" he laughs. \"Damn. Your kids are more mature than you are.\" And that\u0027s how my day is spent while the girls are out shopping for the wedding. My brother gets me up to speed on marriage and fatherhood. I would\u0027ve once thought such a conversation would be boring as hell, but not today. I\u0027m excited about it and can\u0027t wait to experience it for myself.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-41.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
