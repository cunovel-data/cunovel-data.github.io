{"id":83749,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\"Well, it\u0027s a little late for that.\" The way Jolene says it almost makes me think she\u0027s happy about this. Laurelyn holds the bridge of her nose and I suspect she\u0027s racking her brain for every other possible alternative. But she comes up empty because, by morning, this is going to be a wildfire raging out of control. \"I guess I don\u0027t have a choice since it\u0027s coming out anyway. Just let me know when and where I need to be for the interview.\" Chapter Twenty-Three The last several days have spun out of control. It\u0027s gone public now—Jake Beckett is my father—and the vultures have descended. I can hardly push my way through the media gathered at my front door, so I\u0027m forced to sneak out the back to my car parked a block down the street. Jack Henry insists on accompanying me everywhere I go now. He hasn\u0027t said it, but I think he\u0027s worried about my safety. It\u0027s Friday night. We\u0027re down to two days. How did that happen? It feels like it was only yesterday when I saw him get out of that taxi in the midst of the pouring rain. We\u0027re lying on the sofa face to face, my leg hitched over his. \"You\u0027re leaving on Sunday and we still don\u0027t have a plan.\" He draws a breath and blows it out slowly. \"I can\u0027t stay. And unless something has changed, you\u0027re not ready to leave with me.\" He hasn\u0027t come out and said it, but I have to give up everything for us to be together. \"You\u0027re making me choose.\" \"No. Making you choose would be telling you to come with me or forget the whole thing. I\u0027m telling you I love you and I want you more than anything in this world but that I can\u0027t stay.\" Is there really any difference in the two? I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll survive being apart. Those kinds of relationships rarely ever make it. \"I don\u0027t know how we\u0027ll make this work if we\u0027re not together.\" He\u0027s rubbing my arm. I think it\u0027s his way of trying to comfort me, but it doesn\u0027t because nothing will at this point. \"I guess we\u0027ll wing it. We\u0027ll talk every day and see each other when we can. We\u0027ll video chat and you can do a striptease for me in your showgirl costume.\" I feel like I will burst into tears any minute. \"It\u0027s not funny. I\u0027m going to be miserable without you.\" \"Then come home with me so you don\u0027t have to be.\" I want to but I can\u0027t walk away. Not now. \"I can\u0027t.\" \"You mean you won\u0027t.\" His livelihood is dependent upon his knowledge of the grapes he harvests. He\u0027s spent his life learning what each variety requires to prosper. I get that. Leaving the known for the unknown could potentially ruin him, but it\u0027s not fair to make me sound like I\u0027m the only one unwilling to make a sacrifice. \"Just like you won\u0027t stay.\" He takes his hand from my arm and looks up at the ceiling. \"Then I guess it\u0027s settled. You\u0027re staying here. I\u0027m going back. We\u0027re no better off than we were when you slipped away from me four months ago. Except now, I love you so fucking much, it\u0027s going to rip my heart out to be away from you.\" He\u0027s pissed off. I can tell. \"You\u0027re mad?\" \"Hell, yeah, I\u0027m furious that our circumstances are what they are. I want to be with you and you want to be with me. Why can\u0027t we find a way to make this work?\" We lie silently for a while, the tension thick. He finally breaks through it. \"How long is your next tour?\" I\u0027ve purposely been avoiding thinking about it. \"Three months. It starts in August and won\u0027t be over until the end of October. I only get two weeks off before we\u0027re back in the studio to work on the next album.\" \"Can you come spend the holidays with me?\" That\u0027s not going to work. \"We already have Christmas shows booked.\" \"I\u0027m trying to make plans to see you six months in advance, and you can\u0027t work me in. This is going to be a huge problem.\" He says he isn\u0027t making me choose, but he is. He\u0027s not saying it but if I don\u0027t go with him, we\u0027re done. I am as certain of it as I\u0027ve ever been of anything in my life. But why can\u0027t he understand that he\u0027s made me no promises? He hasn\u0027t asked me to marry him—not a serious proposal. I\u0027d be nuts to walk away when I have absolutely no guarantee of anything. He could decide he\u0027s done with me three months from now. I don\u0027t know what else to say. \"Can we try it long distance and see how it goes?\" \"I guess we don\u0027t have much of a choice if you\u0027re not coming with me.\" Is he trying to make me feel worse than I already do? \"Don\u0027t say it like that. You\u0027re making me feel guilty.\" \"If that\u0027s what it takes, then I want you to feel guilty—so much so that you\u0027ll pack all your shit and come home where you belong.\" He says home and I immediately think of Avalon instead of this apartment or that tour bus. It\u0027s where I see myself when I think of him as my husband and I envision the family he wants to give me. My mind is exhausted from rolling this around over and over, trying to come up with a solution that quite honestly doesn\u0027t exist. I\u0027ve thought and worried about our relationship for almost a month, and I\u0027m tired. If only for a little while, I need an escape from the dread of being separated again. \"Take me to bed and make me forget that you\u0027re leaving.\" I sound desperate, but I don\u0027t care. \"If I do, it won\u0027t be to make you forget. I\u0027m gonna show you all the reasons you should go with me.\" \"Whatever. Either works for me.\" He takes my hand and I follow him down the hall to my bedroom. He stops before we reach the bed and kisses me—just a simple, sweet, romantic kiss. When he finishes, I can\u0027t stop myself from sighing heavily. \"You won\u0027t get soft kisses on your lips when I\u0027m gone.\" He moves to my neck and hits that spot just below my ear, the one that always sends chills down my spine. \"Or here.\" He grasps the hem of my shirt and pulls it over my head. He palms my breasts as he continues kissing my neck and then slowly moves down over my shoulder. He reaches around to unfasten my bra as his mouth migrates to the space between my breasts. When I feel the release of my bra, he slides the straps down my arms and it drops to the floor. He kisses my abdomen all the way down as he drops to his knees in front of me. I feel his tongue swipe my belly button as he unfastens my jeans. I hear the sound of my zipper as he slowly slides it down and everything from my nipples down to the tips of my toes tingles. He normally hooks his fingers inside the band of my jeans and underwear to push them down, but not this time. He slides one finger inside the front of my panties and turns his hand over so that his fingertip can softly stroke my clit in a come-hither motion. I feel my panties dampen, that sticky, wet feeling, and every bit of it is for him—this man I love with all my heart. This man I don\u0027t know how to let go of. He stops what he\u0027s doing and grasps my jeans and panties. He pulls them to my ankles and I hold onto his shoulders as I step out, one foot at a time. After he moves them out of the way, he wraps his hands around each of my hipbones and kisses my stomach before his mouth moves in a southerly direction. This is never the best position for what he\u0027s about to do, so I\u0027m glad when he pushes me to sit on the edge of the bed. He reaches for each of my legs and hooks them over his shoulders before he buries his nose against me. \"I wish I could bottle this and take it with me. I\u0027d spray it all over my sheets and roll around in it.\" I giggle as I lace my fingers through his hair and stroke the top of his head. I\u0027m going to miss hearing him say such highly inappropriate things. I reach for the pillows on the bed and place them behind me so I can prop up and watch what he does. He\u0027s turned me into some kind of sex freak; I like to see his mouth between my legs. The dirty bastard has ruined me. Not that I ever want to have sex with another man, but no other could ever come close to bringing me the ecstasy I feel with him. I jerk when his tongue touches me. Not because I\u0027m scared or surprised but because my nerve endings are on fire, calling out to his mouth. It\u0027s sensory overload when they finally feel the sensation they desire so badly. He pushes my legs back with his hands as he moves his tongue faster against me, and I feel that pressure rising, those magnificent waves that begin deep inside and rise until they burst through the surface. \"Ohhh…right there\u0027s the spot. That feels so good.\" He always follows my direction so well. When I tell him he\u0027s in the right spot, he doesn\u0027t stop until he makes me scream. He uses his tongue to apply more pressure to that pleasurable site and I feel my orgasm rushing toward the surface. I grasp his hair as I always do and tug. \"Right there. Just like that.\" And a moment later, my entire body tenses as it escapes my mouth…the scream he knew he\u0027d get out of me. When I release his hair, I still feel his mouth against me as he says, \"And she crosses the finish line, ladies and gentlemen.\" I shove the pillows behind me and scoot backward on the bed. \"This race isn\u0027t over yet.\" He starts at my ankles and kisses his way up my legs. \"Oh, this next part isn\u0027t going to be a race. I plan on taking my time with you, Miss McLachlan. Who knows? This could take all night.\" \"Promise?\" He grins as he continues up each of my legs. When he reaches the apex of my thighs, he stops to kiss the top of my pubic bone. \"Always so smooth. You\u0027ll never know how much I like that.\" He continues up my stomach until he reaches my breasts. His mouth hovers in the center of my chest and he pushes them together to make a Jack Henry sandwich. The thought makes me giggle inwardly. He moves up to my neck and pushes my hands over my head. \"Turn over.\" I roll to my stomach, my hands still over my head, and he begins kissing my neck. He slowly moves his way down and doesn\u0027t leave a single spot neglected. I\u0027m covered in goosebumps—what he\u0027s doing drives me crazy, and he knows it. And then he\u0027s at my lower back—the spot he covets—and he begins licking me. I don\u0027t know what it is about it that he loves so much, but I don\u0027t care if it means he does this to me. It\u0027s a turn-on like no other.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-32.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
