{"id":83730,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"I don\u0027t want to have this conversation right now. And even though I want him to take me to bed and make up for all the time we\u0027ve lost, I know we have to talk about what he saw. \"I\u0027ve spent the last three months in agony believing that you cared nothing for me. I just needed an escape from this emotional roller coaster. I thought Charlie might help me forget you for a little while.\" He drops his head back against the couch and squeezes his eyes shut. I can see he\u0027s about to say something and his expression tells me it isn\u0027t going to come easy for him. And that terrifies me. Chapter Eight Shit! Am I too late? Has she let this Charlie guy into her bed so she could forget me? I am a selfish bastard, and undeniably a possessive one, when it comes to Laurelyn. I don\u0027t want her happier with another man and I\u0027m petrified that she is. I fear he\u0027s giving her the things I didn\u0027t. And telling her the words I should have but refused to say because I was too stubborn to see the truth. I squeeze my eyes shut as I brace myself for her answer to the question I\u0027m bloody terrified to ask. \"Did you let him fuck you?\" Laurelyn won\u0027t lie to me, but that\u0027s only one of the reasons I\u0027m scared to death. I stare into the blackness behind my lids. I won\u0027t be able to bear it if she tells me she let him get inside her. I don\u0027t know how to handle that. I feel her hands on my face. \"Look at me.\" I don\u0027t know if I can until I know she hasn\u0027t been with another man. \"Please, look at me.\" I\u0027ve never been more frightened in my life, but I open my eyes because it\u0027s what she\u0027s asking me to do. Her face is so serious. I think she\u0027s contemplating how to say the words, how to break my heart gently and kill me slowly. I stare at her caramel eyes and wait for the verdict as she strokes her hands down my face. \"Jack Henry.\" I hear her say my name and I\u0027m ready to fall at her feet. \"There\u0027s been no other man since you—not inside my head, my heart, or my body.\" She reaches for my hand and brings it to rest over her heart. \"No other man will ever reside here. It\u0027s reserved for you alone.\" I hear the breath I\u0027m holding escape in relief. Words don\u0027t have a way of describing the solace I\u0027m experiencing. I feel her heart speeding beneath my hand where she\u0027s holding it. It\u0027s keeping pace with mine perfectly. I bring my other hand to her chest and stroke my fingertips across her skin to push the robe away from her shoulders. I lean forward and inhale deeply after I place a single kiss between her bared breasts. She has her own feminine fragrance—despite the scent of my body wash—and it drives me crazy. I can\u0027t get enough of it; I\u0027ve missed it so much. I reach for the velour belt around her waist and pull. I part the lush fabric and push it away so I can see her bareness, but simply gazing at her could never suffice. Looking has never been enough when it comes to Laurelyn. I have to touch her. And I do. \"You\u0027re even more beautiful than I remember.\" I grasp her thighs straddling me and run my hands up until I reach her hips and squeeze. My palm flat against her stomach, I slide it to her chest and back down again. I lean forward and take her rosy pink nipple into my mouth and I feel it grow hard as I circle it with the tip of my tongue. She puts her hand behind my head and pulls me closer as she arches her back and drops her head. I hear a moan escape her lips. She\u0027s naked beneath her robe and squirming against my hard cock. Only the fabric of my pants and undies separates us, but I don\u0027t think that will last much longer since it feels like I could potentially split my pants at any moment. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever wanted her this badly. In an instant, I\u0027m off the couch and carrying her to the bed, her legs wrapped around my waist as she holds tightly around my shoulders. During our travel from the living room to the bedroom, she pulls her arms out of the robe and lets it drop to the floor. I deposit her on the bed and she\u0027s entirely naked—except for the diamond star pendant around her neck—and I can\u0027t stop the smile that spreads across my face. \"You\u0027re wearing your birthday gift.\" She reaches up to touch it where it\u0027s resting against the dip of her throat. \"I haven\u0027t taken it off once since the last time you put it on me.\" Bloody hell I love this girl. I\u0027m pleases me to no end that she has always kept this piece of me with her while we were apart. I think knowing she wore my gift so close to her heart makes me love her even more—if that\u0027s a possibility. I lower myself down against Laurelyn and bring our mouths together. I\u0027m desperate to feel her tongue against mine and taste my American girl\u0027s sweet lips. She opens her mouth to invite me in and it\u0027s better than I remember. Her tongue rolls in waves against mine as they reunite to share an intimate dance they\u0027ve not experienced in a while. My kiss is aggressive because it\u0027s been far too long since I\u0027ve felt Laurelyn. I don\u0027t know how to be anything but vigorous when it comes to her. She retreats to catch her breath and I glide my mouth down her neck toward her shoulder. \"I love these little patches of freckles. I\u0027ve missed kissing them.\" She giggles softly and I move my mouth down her chest. Her laughter stops and I hear a sharp intake of air as I suck her breast into my mouth. I hear her groan, \"Ohh,\" as I pull on her nipple until it\u0027s hard and elongated. I use my teeth to scrape it gently because I know how sensitive her nipples are and how easily she\u0027s turned on when I do that. I\u0027m not playing favorites so I move to the other one and give it the same treatment before I migrate lower. She\u0027s stretched out on the bed and I can\u0027t resist looking at her stomach. I rub my hand over her abdomen below her piercing and the memory of her half-taken birth control pack forces its way to the front of my thoughts. I can\u0027t stop myself from wondering—or maybe even hoping—there\u0027s a part of me growing inside her. It\u0027s unbelievable that I can picture her with my baby on the way and be okay with that. I lower my mouth to her belly to place kisses against it and I feel Laurelyn\u0027s hand glide through my hair. I peer up at her. She\u0027s lifted her head so she can look at me. \"What\u0027s with the special interest there?\" I\u0027m not bringing it up now; it\u0027s not the right time. I don\u0027t want anything to stand in the way of me being inside her. \"Nothing,\" I whisper as I move lower but skip the place I know she wants my mouth most. I want to make this last for as long as possible. I\u0027m kneeling between her legs and I lift her foot to kiss it when I notice something that wasn\u0027t there three months earlier—black script lettering wrapping around the inside of her ankle. \"What is this?\" She props up on her elbows and gives me her patented smart-arse look that says what do you think it is? She doesn\u0027t have to say the words because I can read them on her face. Some things never change, but I must admit I\u0027m glad. I\u0027ve missed her attitude. It\u0027s refreshing. No other woman has ever given me hell like Laurelyn—except Margaret McLachlan. I\u0027ve always heard men marry women like their mothers. Maybe that\u0027s why I love my American girl so much. My thoughts return to the question at hand and I tilt my head so I\u0027m able to see what the tattoo says as I read it aloud. \"He is always the song I sing.\" I look up at her. \"When did you have this done?\" \"A couple weeks after I returned from Australia.\" I think her tattoo refers to me—at least I hope it does—but I want to know for sure. I can\u0027t assume anything at this point. \"Tell me who he is.\" She sighs as she shakes her head. \"Do I have to say the words for you to know?\" Yes. \"Shit, yeh. I want to hear you say it.\" \"It\u0027s you, Jack Henry. It will always be you in every song I sing.\" \"I love it.\" She watches me kiss the spot where she has marked me on her body forever. \"I want to be your song, Laurelyn.\" I move up her leg and kiss the inside of her thigh. \"Always.\" Without breaking eye contact, I move my mouth to the inside of her other thigh. \"And forever.\" She closes her eyes and falls back against the bed. I hear her panting as I inch my mouth closer to the spot where she wants it—where she needs it most. Her legs are trembling as I push them apart. I press my nose against the smooth skin there and inhale deeply. \"I love the way you smell.\" She\u0027s writhing beneath me. I lower my mouth until I\u0027m hovering between her legs, but I don\u0027t touch her. I make certain she can feel my warm breath. I hear her whisper, \"Please…Jack Henry…don\u0027t make me beg,\" as she lifts her hips closer to my mouth. Her shifting tells me that she\u0027s dying for my soft, wet tongue to lick her. I bet I could make her come without even touching her, but we\u0027ll save that little trick for another time. I kiss her across the top of her pubic bone. \"Do you remember how easy it is for me to make you come with my mouth?\" \"No. Remind me,\" she whispers, lifting her hips again. \"Let me see if I can jog your memory a little.\" I butterfly kiss her drenching wet center before I slide my tongue up the middle. I hear her moan, \"Ohh…ohh…don\u0027t you dare stop.\" She tastes so fucking good, I wouldn\u0027t dream of stopping. She\u0027s breathing deep and loud as she rocks her pelvis up and down against my mouth. I can tell how much she\u0027s missed this. And I have too. Words can\u0027t express how much but her sounds of satisfaction are giving me a pretty good indication of the degree. I\u0027m feeling sure that I haven\u0027t forgotten her favorite way to get off. I flatten my tongue against her and slowly lick her core up and down. I know how much she loves it that way. I\u0027m reassured she\u0027s getting exactly what she needs from me when she begins to rock her hips harder. I want to give her the best orgasm of her life, so I slide one finger inside her—and then a second—as I continue to use my tongue above the entry of my fingers. The stimulation of my warm, moist tongue combined with my fingers sliding in and out has Laurelyn screaming my name as she fists my hair to pull me closer.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-13.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
