I\u0027m just having fun doing something that\u0027s new to me.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah—while every man in this casino is blowing his load just looking at you every time you bend over.\" They\u0027re all thinking about how they\u0027d give it to her in that position. I know what the fuckers are thinking because I have the same thing on my mind.\\n\\n \"Come on. You\u0027re being a little dramatic, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n Hell, no, I\u0027m not being dramatic. She isn\u0027t sitting back watching these bastards eye-fuck her. \"No. They\u0027re all watching you, even the ones here with women.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027re the only one who gets to be with me.\" She takes her chips from the table. \"Let me cash in and we\u0027ll go upstairs so we can get busy.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, hey. Now you\u0027re talking.\"\\n\\n Yeah. I just acted like a toddler throwing a fit, but it totally worked so I don\u0027t give a fuck. I put my drink down on the lower shelf of the craps table because I don\u0027t need another drop of alcohol. I\u0027m not wasted but I definitely have had more to drink than I should have. Laurelyn still has a surprise for me when we get in the room—I\u0027ll bet it\u0027s hot lingerie. She loves to dress up for me.\\n\\n When we\u0027re back in the room, Laurelyn takes a bag from the top of the closet and tells me to sit in the chair in the living room to wait while she changes. She seems to be taking a long time. \"Everything okay in there?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Just give me another minute. This is trickier than I thought.\"\\n\\n Hmm…that sounds interesting.\\n\\n She opens the door an inch or two and peeks out through the crack. \"Close your eyes.\"\\n\\n I love it when she makes me do that. That means this is going to be fan-fucking-tastic. \"Okay. They\u0027re closed.\"\\n\\n I hear the start of slow, seductive music I don\u0027t recognize and she tells me I can open my eyes. I\u0027m more than a little surprised to see her standing in front of me dressed in her sexiest ensemble yet—a black and red showgirl costume. \"Fuck me running! You look so damn fine in that, baby.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you like it.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I more than like it.\"\\n\\n She begins to move to the music. \"I don\u0027t have my pole so I\u0027ll have to improvise.\"\\n\\n I put my hand on the crotch of my pants. \"There\u0027s only one pole that counts and I\u0027ve got it right here.\"\\n\\n \"That mouth of yours…\"\\n\\n \"You love this mouth of mine and everything it does to make you come.\"\\n\\n She lifts the back of her hair from her neck and bites her lower lip as she bends at her knees, swaying her hips. \"Yes, I do.\"\\n\\n She turns her back to me and slowly swings her bum from side to side in my face. The feathers forming a skirt oscillate back and forth and I think about what I\u0027m going to do to that arse when I get her out of that costume. She doesn\u0027t know, or maybe she does, how it\u0027s killing me to see her look so damn hot without being able to pounce on top of her.\\n\\n \"Talk dirty to me,\" she purrs.\\n\\n That won\u0027t be a problem. \"I\u0027m so fucking hard for you right now. When I get you out of that costume, I\u0027m gonna bend you over and fuck you from behind because you\u0027re a dirty girl and I know you love it.\"\\n\\n She bends at her waist and shakes her bum in my face. \"Mmm-hmm. I love it when you do me like that.\"\\n\\n Oh, hell! She hasn\u0027t even touched me and I think I may be close to blowing my load just by hearing her talk dirty. \"Come here and give me a lap dance.\"\\n\\n She shimmies her way over and sits on my lap with her legs wide apart. She lightly rubs her bottom back and forth across my hard-on and then leans closer until her back is against my chest. She drops her head back and my mouth hovers over her ear. I nip at her earlobe and she moans, \"Say something else dirty.\"\\n\\n I suck her earlobe and then release it as I move my hands to her proud breasts standing up in her bustier. I don\u0027t know where it comes from but I suddenly feel this intense emotion overtake me, and it\u0027s not lust. It\u0027s love. And it makes me brave.\\n\\n I feel my heart racing as I prepare to say the words that just popped into my head. I reach for her face and turn it so she can see me over her shoulder. \"Marry me.\"\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-One\\n\\n Jack Henry just asked me to marry him. Sort of. Maybe. I\u0027m not really sure if that was supposed to be a real proposal. I don\u0027t know if I can take him seriously; he\u0027s drunk as hell. Who knows if tomorrow he\u0027ll remember bringing it up?\\n\\n I spin around so I\u0027m sitting sideways across his lap. I need to see his eyes. \"What did you just say?\"\\n\\n His blue eyes are hazy but they don\u0027t leave mine. \"I said, marry me.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re drunk.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I am a little wasted, so you have a good argument there, but I still know what I\u0027m saying. I\u0027ve been thinking about it for a while—a long while, actually. I love you and I want you to be my wife.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t say I\u0027m really all that excited about a drunk proposal.\"\\n\\n \"I get that this is really bad. I know my proposal is terrible, but don\u0027t say no. I can do better when I haven\u0027t been drinking. I\u0027ll have some flowers and a ring and I\u0027ll say things to make you swoon.\" At least he recognizes the problem.\\n\\n I can\u0027t put too much thought into the things he\u0027s saying. I\u0027d be a fool to get my hopes up but I must admit I love hearing those words come from his mouth. I\u0027m not fool enough to encourage this talk while he\u0027s shitfaced, so I take him by the hand and tug until he\u0027s up from the chair. I lead him toward the bedroom and we stop beside the bed. I loosen the knot of his tie before I lift it over his head and fling it to the chair in the corner of the room. I unbutton his shirt and pants to remove them before he lies down. I figure it\u0027ll be much easier than trying to undress a drunk, oversized toddler in the bed.\\n\\n When I have him naked, I barely push my finger against his chest and he falls backwards. \"Tim…ber.\"\\n\\n He chuckles at my reference. \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ve got some wood for you.\"\\n\\n Even drunk, he\u0027s still witty.\\n\\n He scoots up in the bed until his head is propped on a pillow. \"Strip for me.\"\\n\\n The music has moved on to another sexy tune, so I begin my slow seduction of removing my showgirl outfit. He watches me with heavy, hooded eyes and I wonder if I\u0027ll be able to get naked before he passes out. I decide I probably shouldn\u0027t tarry too long in removing my costume.\\n\\n When I\u0027m free of the getup, I crawl up the bed and straddle him. I don\u0027t figure I should expect a lot of extracurricular activities since he\u0027s a bit saturated with whiskey, so I sink down on him. He watches me as I ride him and moves his hands to my breasts. He squeeze them as I move up and down his length. \"I love your tits so much. They\u0027re fucking perfect.\"\\n\\n He rises and flips me onto my back. He\u0027s kissing down my shoulder onto my chest and then takes one of the rosy pink tips into his mouth. \"I can\u0027t wait to see you nurse our babies.\"\\n\\n Whoa. That\u0027s not dirty talk. It\u0027s serious when you start bringing babies into the mix.\\n\\n I\u0027m not even drunk and my head is spinning.\\n\\n And he said babies—as in more than one. This Jack Henry is so different than the man I met six months ago. This one tells me he wants things that the other one was hell-bent on never having a part of. Maybe I\u0027ll regret it, but I decide I want to explore this a little more while his tongue is loose. \"You changed your mind about wanting babies?\"\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t answer so I grab the top of his hair to pull his mouth from my nipple. \"You changed your mind about getting married and wanting kids?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n I grab his face to make him look at me. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because I love you and I want to be your husband.\" He slides down and kisses my stomach. \"And I want to see your belly grow with a part of me in it.\" He rubs me there. \"I wanted you to be pregnant when I found you, but you didn\u0027t know that, did you?\"\\n\\n \"I sort of suspected it based on how you acted and the things you said.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s probably better to be married for a while without a kid on the way.\"\\n\\n \"I think that\u0027s highly recommended.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. \u0027Cause I\u0027m gonna want to fuck you a lot.\" He enters me and groans, \"Oh, this is so good. I\u0027m gonna do this every day after I marry you.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s all drunken talk so I probably can\u0027t pay it any attention, but it still sends shivers down my spine to hear him say things about marrying me and having babies. I have to question if he means what he\u0027s saying. After all, he is wasted. How sincere can he possibly be when he\u0027s in this kind of shape? There\u0027s only one way to tell—see what he says when he\u0027s sober.\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t mention marriage or babies the next day. Or the next. I\u0027m beginning to think he doesn\u0027t remember our discussion at all. Sure. I have no idea what I\u0027d say if he asked me for real, but it pisses me off that he hasn\u0027t brought it up once. It\u0027s like the whole conversation didn\u0027t happen.\\n\\n Maybe he doesn\u0027t have a recollection. He was definitely wasted. But I want him to remember saying those things to me. I want him to say them again when he\u0027s not shitfaced—even if I\u0027m not sure what my response would be.\\n\\n We\u0027re back in Nashville and I have two days before I return to the studio with the band. That means we only have two weeks before Jack Henry goes home. I don\u0027t want him to go. I wish he could stay here with me forever, but time isn\u0027t our friend. It never has been. Our moments together are always the grains of sand falling through the hourglass. A few months here. Another month there. I\u0027m sick of having time restraints placed on this relationship like we have an expiration date.\\n\\n It\u0027s Saturday morning and we\u0027re lounging on the couch. Jack Henry\u0027s head is in my lap while I\u0027m reading my latest romance novel and I\u0027m running my fingers through his hair. I know how much he loves it. He\u0027s relaxed, eyes closed, and I suspect he may have drifted off until he asks, \"What do you want to do today?\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t want to do anything but be here with him without any distractions. \"This.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-30.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \\n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \\n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
