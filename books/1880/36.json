{"id":83753,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"\"What do you mean?\" I\u0027m pretty sure I didn\u0027t stutter. \"Exactly what I said—she stayed in the States.\" \"I don\u0027t understand. I thought things were going well with the two of you.\" \"They were—they are—but her career really took off and now she\u0027s a big country superstar. Her fans love her and her music. She\u0027s worked really hard to get where she is and she just isn\u0027t ready to leave it behind yet.\" I see her disappointment. \"You\u0027re telling me she chose her career over you?\" \"Don\u0027t think poorly of her over this, Mum. I\u0027m doing the same thing to her.\" She looks shocked. \"But I was so certain she\u0027d give up all of that for you—especially after spending the whole month together.\" \"I\u0027m confident she will in time, but Laurelyn needs a little longer so she can figure that out on her own. I won\u0027t have her hating or blaming me for a life she thinks she missed out on. She needs to experience it all so she can be certain of what she really wants.\" \"But what if she never wants to leave that life? Glitz and glamour can be very deceiving. You know that from experience.\" I do, and Laurelyn isn\u0027t going to love it for long because she\u0027s not that kind of person. \"Trust me, Mum…I know Laurelyn and what she really wants. Right now, she may think it\u0027s a dazzling career, but that life won\u0027t keep her satisfied. She wants a husband…and babies. Those are things she can\u0027t have if she\u0027s constantly traveling.\" \"So, you\u0027re going to sit around and wait on her and your life together until God only knows when?\" Yes. That\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m going to do. \"I don\u0027t really have much of a choice at this point, but I\u0027m not worried. It isn\u0027t going to take long for her to get enough of that life because it\u0027s not all glitz and glamour. Traveling on a tour bus from city to city and sleeping in a different hotel every night isn\u0027t going to make her happy. I did it with her for a little while, and I got sick of it pretty fast, so I\u0027m not concerned. She\u0027ll be here with me before the holidays. I\u0027m certain of it.\" \"How can you be so sure?\" I can see that she needs further convincing. \"I gave her a ring.\" This returns the smile to my mum\u0027s face. \"You asked her to marry you?\" \"Sort of.\" There goes the smile. \"What did you say when you gave it to her?\" \"I told her she needed time to experience everything that life could hold for her and when she felt like she\u0027d had all she needed, I wanted her to come to me and I\u0027d ask her to be my wife. I asked her to wear the ring as a reminder that I was waiting for her.\" She looks a little more hopeful. \"Was she surprised?\" \"Surprised is probably a good word to describe what she was feeling—among others. I waited too long and panicked, so I did the only thing I could. I gave it to her about two minutes before I boarded my plane.\" She looks disgusted with me. \"Oh, Jack Henry! Why did you do it that way? That\u0027s so unromantic.\" \"I was waiting for the perfect moment but it never came. I just wanted it to be special—something she\u0027d remember. But then I ran out of time.\" I try to defend my actions but it\u0027s in vain. \"Well, that\u0027s one she\u0027s never going to forget. Have you spoken to her since you dropped it on her like a bomb?\" Like a bomb—that\u0027s the perfect description. \"I spoke with her during my stopover in Los Angeles. She was pretty pissed off but I could hear her smiling.\" \"You can hear Laurelyn\u0027s smile over the phone?\" I don\u0027t think she believes me. \"Of course, I can. Her voice sounds different when she\u0027s smiling. It almost sounds like a giggle when she\u0027s talking.\" I think my mum is laughing at me. \"What?\" \"You. You\u0027re so in love with that girl. I can see it on your face and hear it in your voice. It makes me happy to see you this way. And I agree with you. I think she\u0027ll come soon because she loves you too.\" \"I hope so. I\u0027m going to do everything I can to persuade her from afar.\" One week apart and I\u0027m surviving—but not well. Laurelyn and I talk every day. It gets me by but that\u0027s about all I can say for our conversations. She\u0027s so obscure, giving me no indication of where her head is where we\u0027re concerned. I\u0027ve thrown myself into work as a distraction, much like I did after she left in March. It\u0027s very early in the season but things are looking great at all the vineyards. My right-hand men have proven themselves worthy in my absence. I moved from my apartment in Sydney back to Avalon because it\u0027s where I feel closest to her. I pulled one of her little tricks and stole some of her clothes so I could have her smell with me. I might have even stolen some of her knickers as well. I wonder what she\u0027d say about that if she knew. I imagine her calling me a dirty bastard. That\u0027s what she usually does when I\u0027m inappropriate—but she loved every filthy thing I did to her. And she will again. I hope soon. It\u0027s time for our daily call so I text to let her know I want to video chat. I want to see and hear her. I\u0027m waiting in my office to give her time to get set up and I take out the undies I\u0027ve been keeping in the top drawer of my desk. I have a pair for here and another pair I keep in my nightstand. These are the black lace knickers. I bring them to my nose and inhale deeply. They still smell just like her. I hope she gets her arse down here before these lose her scent or I\u0027ll be going back for more. When I feel like she\u0027s had long enough to get ready, I contact her. When I see her beautiful face, I\u0027m ruined all over again. I want to drop everything here and run back to her so I can throw her over my shoulder and haul her down here like the caveman she calls me. \"Hey, baby. It\u0027s so good to see you.\" \"I miss you.\" \"I miss you too. How was work today?\" I ask this every time we speak so I can hopefully get some indication on what her plan is, but she\u0027s always so vague. \"Same ol\u0027 thing as always. We practiced all day in the studio to get ready for the tour.\" That\u0027s the first time she\u0027s mentioned going back on the road. I shouldn\u0027t be surprised she\u0027s planning to do it since she hasn\u0027t mentioned coming here. For a moment, I\u0027m disappointed but then I remember that traveling on that bus and sleeping in hotels is exactly what Laurelyn needs to make her realize she should be here with me. \"Will you try to get a little time off for the holidays to visit? My family really wants to see you again. Mum is having a fit for you to come back, and you might as well know that she wasn\u0027t incredibly enthused by the way I left things with you.\" She\u0027s already told me she\u0027ll be busy during the holidays, but I ask again anyway—it\u0027s a good way to point out how her job with the band is going to keep us from being together at Christmas. \"Has she given you a hard time?\" Such a Laurelyn reply—her way of avoiding answering my question. \"She hasn\u0027t been easy on me. I have my orders to have you here for the holidays so the whole family can be together.\" She\u0027s smiling. \"The whole family, huh?\" She\u0027s a part of the McLachlan clan, even if she doesn\u0027t realize it yet. \"You\u0027re part of this family whether you\u0027re here or there.\" \"How is Emma this week?\" Why does she do that—switch to a different subject just when I think I\u0027m going to get something out of her? \"She started having contractions yesterday after we spoke, so she had to be admitted to the hospital last night to get the medicine to stop them.\" She looks alarmed. \"Is it serious?\" \"It is, but it happens every time, so we don\u0027t get excited like we did when it happened with Celia. Her doctor wants to keep her pregnant another month, but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s going to happen. It started a lot earlier this time. The baby would be fine if he was born now. He\u0027d just be small and have to grow in the hospital for a while.\" It\u0027s my turn to change the subject, and I\u0027m not holding back. \"We haven\u0027t talked about what kind of wedding you\u0027d want.\" I think talking about these things will make her more inclined to accept sooner. \"I don\u0027t know. What kind do you want?\" Men don\u0027t care about those things. \"The kind that would make me your husband. That\u0027s my only requirement. Big or small?\" \"Something small. It would only be your family and friends attending.\" She looks sad. \"Why do you say that?\" \"My mom told me she wouldn\u0027t come to Australia. I assume that would include seeing me get married.\" That bitch. It\u0027s a ploy to get Laurelyn to stay so she won\u0027t leave her or her career. I see the pain in Laurelyn\u0027s eyes and I want nothing more than to hold her. But I can\u0027t, and it\u0027s frustrating as hell. \"I would marry you in the States if you want her to be there. I\u0027ll come tomorrow if you want me to and my family would drop everything to be there.\" \"I love you for your willingness to do anything to make me happy, but I couldn\u0027t ask that of you or your family. It wouldn\u0027t be right to have all of them come here.\" That seems promising. \"It sounds like you\u0027re saying yes.\" \"Let\u0027s call it a non-no.\" It\u0027s a yes, even if she won\u0027t come out and say it. \"A non-no. I can live with that for now, but it won\u0027t get you by forever.\" \"I know.\" There is something she can do to get me by. \"Would you be willing to do something for me?\" \"You know I will.\" She\u0027s going to think I\u0027m a filthy bastard for sure when I ask her but I can\u0027t help it; I\u0027m so hard up for her. It\u0027s terrible going from sex every day to nothing at all. \"I really need to get off and I\u0027d love to see you naked while I do it.\" \"Jack Henry!\" She thought I was kidding when I mentioned it before I left. I wasn\u0027t. \"Come on, baby. Do a striptease for me. Please.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-36.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
