He does his nibbling thing where he bites my ass, but then he moves his mouth down between my thighs. He uses his knee to push my legs apart and shoves the pillows under me. I\u0027m bent over them and…oh, fuck! He licks my girlie parts. From behind. He\u0027s never done it from that angle before and it feels…kinky. And I like it. A lot.\\n\\n He grabs the back of my thighs and pushes them up and apart so my bottom is up in the air. I think being positioned like this would be mortifying as hell if what he was doing didn\u0027t feel so amazing.\\n\\n He astonishes me the way he can always pull a different rabbit out of his hat.\\n\\n He suddenly stops and says, \"No, you\u0027re not coming like this again. I want to be inside you next time you get off.\" He cues me to roll over by tugging on my hip.\\n\\n When I\u0027m on my back again, he lies down on top of me. We\u0027re eye to eye. He runs his hands down the length of my arms until he finds my hands and lifts them over my head. He laces his fingers through mine and squeezes them. He doesn\u0027t take his eyes from mine—and doesn\u0027t even blink—as he enters me. But I see the look, the one that tells me how good it feels to be inside me. I can never mistake that look of pleasure for any other.\\n\\n I bring my legs up and around him so I can feel him deeper. With Jack Henry, close is never close enough. I always want him nearer.\\n\\n He props his weight on his elbows and cradles my head inside his lower arms. He showers kisses all across my face. \"I love you so much. You are everything to me.\" Our hands are still fisted above my head and he squeezes them tighter as he continues slowly moving inside me. He presses his forehead against mine. \"You kissed my heart awake.\"\\n\\n Now it\u0027s me squeezing his hands tighter. \"God, I love you.\"\\n\\n He shifts his hips so he\u0027s putting friction against my sweet spot as he moves in and out of me. There\u0027s nothing like having a man who can make me come so many different ways, even with slow, gentle lovemaking. But there\u0027s especially nothing like hearing him tell me he loves me as it happens. From what I hear, I\u0027m in the minority. I don\u0027t think most women orgasm with intercourse alone. But not all women have Jack Henry for a lover.\\n\\n When it\u0027s over, he relaxes against me. I take my legs from around him and let them fall apart so he can nestle between them while he\u0027s still inside me. I cherish these moments, when we\u0027re still joined as one.\\n\\n \"Promise me you won\u0027t let another man do these things to you after I\u0027m gone.\"\\n\\n Wow. That sounds so final, like we\u0027re going to say goodbye and never see one another again. \"No man will touch me like this or any other way. You\u0027re the only one.\"\\n\\n \"Swear to me.\"\\n\\n \"I swear.\"\\n\\n He wraps his arms around me and I do the same. We squeeze one another to the point that it\u0027s almost painful. \"I\u0027m terrified of losing you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m terrified of losing you too.\"\\n\\n He presses his forehead to mine again. \"I can\u0027t stand it. I said I wouldn\u0027t do this, but I can\u0027t help myself. Please, come home with me. I know you can\u0027t have the career you want in Australia, but you know I can take care of you. You\u0027ll have anything your heart desires and you\u0027ll never have to work.\"\\n\\n I consider it for a moment, but he still hasn\u0027t asked me to marry him. \"I can\u0027t. I don\u0027t know how we\u0027ll make it work, but we\u0027ll find a way. We have to because the alternative isn\u0027t an option.\"\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-Four\\n\\n Laurelyn and I have spent the last two days either in bed or in the shower so we could go back to bed together. I\u0027d say these were the best days of my life except for the reason behind why we\u0027ve been nymphos for the last forty-eight hours.\\n\\n I\u0027m leaving today, and she\u0027s not coming with me.\\n\\n We\u0027re standing at the security checkpoint and the sickening feeling I have in my stomach is far worse than I\u0027d imagined it would be. I feel short of breath and my chest aches from my heart being torn out. The pain is even worse than when I found Laurelyn\u0027s goodbye letter.\\n\\n I\u0027m not a man who cries—ever—yet I feel it right there about to happen. It\u0027s foreign and I\u0027m fighting it, but it\u0027s getting harder and harder with each passing minute. Our separation is imminent, and inevitable.\\n\\n I\u0027m holding her in my arms. I\u0027m squeezing her harder than I should. I\u0027m probably hurting her, but it\u0027s my attempt at meshing us into one so I don\u0027t leave her behind. And it isn\u0027t working.\\n\\n I hear her soft, sweet voice against my ear and feel her trembling in my arms. \"Don\u0027t leave,\" she whispers.\\n\\n I feel the tears when they come and I bury my face in her hair. \"Don\u0027t let me leave without you.\"\\n\\n And we\u0027re back to that place I hate. She won\u0027t come and I can\u0027t stay.\\n\\n Our time together is winding down. We don\u0027t have much time left and I pull away from her so I can see her face. \"This is not at all the way I wanted to do this.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I didn\u0027t want you to leave with things between us feeling so…unsettled.\"\\n\\n She doesn\u0027t understand I\u0027m referring to something entirely different. \"That\u0027s not what I mean, baby.\" I reach into my pocket and take out the black leather box I\u0027ve carried everywhere with me for the last two weeks. I waited for the perfect moment, but it never presented itself. Now I get to do it this way only minutes before I\u0027m about to leave her for God knows how long.\\n\\n I hold it out so she can see it. I want her to have a moment to absorb where I\u0027m about to go. She looks at it briefly before her eyes dart up to meet mine. She looks like she wants to say something but can\u0027t quite spit the words out.\\n\\n \"Laurelyn, I once asked you to be mine for three months. Now, I\u0027m asking you to be mine forever.\"\\n\\n She opens her mouth to speak and I place my fingers to her lips. \"But I don\u0027t want your answer right now because you\u0027re not ready to say yes. You still need time to spread your wings and fly. I love you with all my heart and I want you to experience everything this life has to offer you because it won\u0027t wait. But I will. I\u0027ll wait for you as long as it takes, and you can come to me after you\u0027ve had enough of this life…when you\u0027re ready to spend forever with me.\"\\n\\n Tears fill her eyes. \"You can not do this to me right before you get on a plane to leave.\"\\n\\n I hear the last call for my flight to LA, so I flip the ring box open. \"When you come to me, I will ask you to be my wife, but until then…\" She cups her mouth when she sees the ring. I take her left hand and slide the diamond engagement ring onto her finger. \"I know you don\u0027t usually wear the ring until you say yes, but I want you to wear this as a reminder that I am waiting for you. Every time you look at it on your finger, know that I\u0027m anxiously looking forward to you coming to me so we can begin our forever together.\"\\n\\n Tears spill down her cheeks. \"I\u0027m so pissed off at you right now that I can\u0027t see straight. I simultaneously love the fuck out of you while I hate your guts. I don\u0027t know if I want to slap your face or get naked with you.\"\\n\\n \"My vote would be for getting naked, but I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll allow that here in the airport.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe you just did this to me.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m flirting with missing my flight. \"I have to go, baby.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Think of the story we\u0027ll be able to tell our kids if you say yes.\"\\n\\n She stands at the security point entrance and is sobbing hysterically when I pass the point where I\u0027ll no longer be able to see her. It breaks my heart. That\u0027s not at all the way I wanted my proposal to happen, but I\u0027m not sorry about it. I know what I\u0027m doing. One way or another, I\u0027m going to have her as my wife.\\n\\n I have two hours until I board my connecting flight to Sydney. I take my mobile from my pocket and I\u0027m pretty sure I stare at it for ten minutes. I dread making this call and having the talk—our first post-sort-of-proposal conversation. It\u0027s only been four hours since I left Laurelyn in Nashville and I\u0027m convinced she\u0027s ready to rip me a new one now that she\u0027s had time to think about what I did.\\n\\n I wait for her to answer and realize I\u0027m nervous—like, really fucking nervous. What if she used the last four hours to think about what an asshat I am and decided there\u0027s no way in hell she\u0027d ever marry me? I want to hang up. I\u0027m even considering it when I hear her voice.\\n\\n \"You are in so much trouble, caveman.\"\\n\\n She called me cavemen. That\u0027s a good sign. She can\u0027t be too mad if she called me that instead of jackhole, which she uses frequently.\\n\\n Should I say I\u0027m sorry? \u0027Cause I\u0027m not, and to do so would be lying. \"I don\u0027t regret what I did, even if you\u0027re angry with me. The only thing I regret is sitting around waiting for the ideal moment to present itself so I could properly ask you to be my wife. That clearly didn\u0027t happen and I\u0027m sorry. I wanted it to be a perfect moment because you\u0027ve not had many of those in your life, but I messed it up like I always do.\"\\n\\n \"I really want to be naked with you right now.\"\\n\\n That sounds promising. \"I\u0027d really like that a lot, but I\u0027m willing to accept your answer in its place. I know I told you that I didn\u0027t want your response right now, but if it\u0027s yes, then you can go ahead and tell me.\"\\n\\n \"What? And ruin the angst you so deserve to feel? I don\u0027t think so, Mr. McLachlan. You give me a proposal like that and you should expect to wait on an answer—for a while.\"\\n\\n Uh-oh. That part doesn\u0027t sound so good. \"So you\u0027re punishing me for wanting to marry you?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m punishing you for that fast one you just pulled on me.\"\\n\\n I was hoping she would be so thrilled about the whole thing that she\u0027d sort of forget the way I did it. \"This isn\u0027t much of a way to begin our union. I don\u0027t think tit-for-tat is the best strategy for making a marriage work.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say I was marrying you.\"\\n\\n But she will. I\u0027ll see to it. \"You didn\u0027t tell me you weren\u0027t, so until you say otherwise, I\u0027ll be waiting anxiously for you to come to me.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-33.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \\n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \\n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
