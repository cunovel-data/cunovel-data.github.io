With a fair amount of certainty, I think you can label me as your sure thing.\"\n \"As much as I love hearing that, I do mean it when I say I love you infinitely.\"\n \"I know you do. And I feel the same about you.\" I hold out my wrist. \"Now, put my bracelet on me so I can show off your love.\"\n He fastens the clasp around my wrist and brings my hand to his lips for a kiss. \"I\u0027ll only be a few minutes getting ready.\"\n \"You never told me where we\u0027re going.\"\n \"I know,\" he says, grinning, but offers no further explanation.\n As promised, he\u0027s ready in little to no time at all. He\u0027s in a suit, something I haven\u0027t seen him wear in a really long time. It\u0027s platinum with a white and silver pinstriped shirt and a brilliant blue tie that brings out the breathtaking beauty of his eyes. Seeing him in it reminds me of the night we met in that blues club in Wagga Wagga.\n \"Mmm…still hotter than the devil\u0027s ass.\"\n \"What\u0027s that, love?\" He heard me. I know he did. He just wants to hear me say it again.\n \"I was just saying you still look hotter than the devil\u0027s ass when you wear a suit.\"\n \"Wow. If I\u0027d known you felt that way, I\u0027d have worn one more often.\"\n \"I like you just fine in your jeans and Indiana Jones hat.\" Especially the hat. I\u0027ll have to ask him to wear nothing but the hat one day since he asked me to wear nothing but my boots.\n \"You find the hat I wear to work sexy?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t bring it with me.\"\n \"That\u0027s okay.\" I catch myself before I blurt out that I can see him wear it when we get back to Australia.\n It\u0027s such an automatic thought, the idea of going back with him. But is that what I need to do? The mystery isn\u0027t in whether I want him or not—it\u0027s if I can leave my career and family for a life with him nine thousand miles away.\n And I still don\u0027t know the answer.\n Chapter Twenty\n I see the look on Laurelyn\u0027s face and I know she\u0027s worrying about where our relationship is going and how we\u0027ll make things work. But I don\u0027t want this getaway to be about stress or angst. I only want us to have fun. And sex. Lots of sex. \"Don\u0027t go there.\"\n She wrinkles her forehead. \"Don\u0027t go where?\"\n She\u0027s being coy. She knows exactly what I mean. \"Wherever it is you go in your head when you get that tense look on your face.\"\n \"Maybe I\u0027m constipated.\"\n That\u0027s my girl. Take a potentially painful subject and turn it into something funny. \"Okay, Miss Comedienne. We\u0027ll pretend you\u0027re constipated instead of worried about our relationship.\" I hold out my hand for her. \"Come on. Let\u0027s go.\"\n We step off the elevator and I lead her toward the restaurant I\u0027ve chosen. We\u0027re seated in a room where we\u0027ll be catered to by our own personal chef. \"Are you hungry, babe?\"\n \"Yes. I\u0027m starving.\"\n \"Craving anything in particular?\"\n She grins mischievously. \"I want meat.\"\n \"That can be arranged. In fact, you can have a little now and a lot later. I know you like your steak cooked medium but what you\u0027ll have later will be done well.\"\n \"I like things that are done well—especially when it\u0027s me.\"\n I bring her hand to my lips for a kiss. \"I intend on doing you quite well, love.\"\n \"You always do,\" she giggles as our server arrives at our table.\n After enjoying a lovely meal with my beautiful girl, we leave the restaurant and I know her curiosity is piqued. \"Are you ready to know what\u0027s next on the agenda?\"\n Her eyes are big with anticipation. \"Of course.\"\n \"There aren\u0027t any good concerts tonight, so I booked a burlesque show.\" She breaks into a huge grin and I have to wonder what it\u0027s all about. \"I thought you might like it since it\u0027s traditional Vegas stuff. We don\u0027t have to go if you don\u0027t want to.\"\n \"Oh, I definitely want to go.\"\n I was afraid she might be pissed off at me for getting tickets to a show where women would be in skimpy costumes, but she clearly isn\u0027t. \"You seem pretty excited about it. I was a little worried you might not want to see near-naked women dancing or that you might be mad at me because you\u0027d think I wanted to see them.\"\n \"I\u0027m not a hater. I\u0027m a congratulator and it\u0027s just a show.\" God, you\u0027ve got to love a woman with that kind of attitude. \"You\u0027re not going to be making out with anyone except me.\"\n \"Damn right. We have private seats, so we might do more than make out.\"\n \"Umm…no.\"\n She knows I hate hearing her tell me no. \"Why not?\" As my words come out, I recognize that I sound like a child.\n \"I have my reasons. You\u0027ll be glad we waited when you see what they are.\"\n My curiosity is at an all-time high. \"You have my mind reeling.\"\n \"Good.\"\n We\u0027re seated in our private section, hidden from view of most everyone at the show. These seats weren\u0027t easy to score and they cost me a fortune, but I was willing to pay any price because I was planning to have some naughty fun with Laurelyn. What does she have up her sleeve?\n At one point during the show, I try to creep my hand up her dress, but she slaps it away and scolds me with her eyes. Literally. \"What?\"\n \"You already know what.\"\n \"No, that\u0027s the problem. I don\u0027t know what.\" I think I could ease off a little if I did know.\n She takes my hand from her leg and cups hers around it. \"I have something special for you later and I\u0027m not serving appetizers. So stop or I\u0027m gonna get mad.\"\n I see there\u0027s no persuading her so I should calm it down. \"I can\u0027t help it. I\u0027m frustrated as fuck because I want you so bad.\"\n \"You\u0027re going to have me tonight but you have to learn some patience.\"\n Easy for her to say when she\u0027s the one withholding sex. \"Why should I be patient when I don\u0027t have to be? No one is stopping us but you.\"\n I see the expression on her face change before she turns to look straight ahead. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve hurt her or pissed her off. \"I\u0027m sorry, babe. I didn\u0027t mean that the way it sounded.\"\n She refuses to look at me. That\u0027s not good. \"I think you did.\"\n \"Yeah, you\u0027re right. I did, but I don\u0027t want to fight about this. If you say we\u0027re waiting, then we\u0027re waiting. Blue balls or not, I swear I won\u0027t pressure you anymore.\"\n She seems to soften. \"We can go back to the room now if you want.\"\n She says it so sweet, I feel like a giant dick. \"No. I can see that this is important to you, so we\u0027ll wait.\"\n We finish the show but all I can think about the whole time is getting her back to the room so I can make her scream, which isn\u0027t helping with my growing case of blue balls.\n We\u0027re walking through the casino and I see her looking at the tables with curiosity. \"Have you ever played?\"\n \"No. I\u0027ve never even been inside a casino.\" She\u0027s twenty-three and she\u0027s never gambled? I thought that was one of the first things you did when you turned twenty-one. \"It looks like a Disney World for adults. Of course, I\u0027ve never been there, either, so what do I know?\"\n \"Ah, baby! I have so many places I want to take you.\" I want to show her the world.\n \"And there\u0027s no one I\u0027d rather go with.\" I don\u0027t doubt her sincerity for a second.\n I gesture toward the tables. \"You want to play? I\u0027ll teach you what you need to know.\"\n She looks around and takes it all in for a moment before she points to a craps table. \"I think I might like to roll dice.\"\n We find a hole and I throw a few fat bills in front of the dealer before several stacks of chips are pushed in our direction. I lift the towers and place them in front of her.\n \"You\u0027ll have to explain it to me because I have no idea what I\u0027m doing.\"\n \"I\u0027m not an expert on all the ins and outs, but I know the basics.\" When it\u0027s time for a fresh roll, I show her where to place her bet. \"You\u0027ll put your chip here. If he rolls a seven or eleven, then you\u0027re a winner. But if he rolls a two, three, or twelve, then you lose. If he gets a number other than two, three, seven, eleven, or twelve, then he must roll that same number again before a seven to be a winner.\"\n \"Oh, shit. That\u0027s complicated.\"\n \"It\u0027s not once you get the hang of it.\"\n She\u0027s scared to make bets at first but begins to warm up to the idea after several rolls. In no time at all, she\u0027s looking like a pro and has even gotten brave enough to roll the dice a few times. She\u0027s actually pretty good at it and has some nice runs when she rolls.\n It\u0027s not surprising she catches the attention of every man at the table, young and old. I see them noticing her, and although I know she isn\u0027t interested, I don\u0027t care for the way they look at her. I especially don\u0027t like the way they look at her tits and arse when she\u0027s leaning forward to grab the dice and place bets.\n I find myself drinking more than I should because I\u0027m feeling a jealous streak. \"Are you ready to go back to the room?\"\n She doesn\u0027t even look at me. \"This is so much fun. Are you not having a good time?\"\n \"I\u0027d be having a much better time if we were in the room naked.\"\n She leans over the table and every guy there is either checking out her cleavage or the rise of her hemline. \"Just a little longer.\"\n Fuck! I\u0027ve created a monster.\n Just a little longer turns into another hour and I\u0027m on the drunk side before I mean to be. The combination of blokes ogling Laurelyn and the whiskey has put me in a particularly bad mood. \"I\u0027m done here. You can come up to the room when you want. Or not. Whatever.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-29.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
