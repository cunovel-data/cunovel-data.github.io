{"id":83722,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Word of my return travels fast and people are in and out of the studio to see if the rumor is true. I\u0027m greeted by those I once saw on a daily basis, but then the dust settles and there\u0027s business to discuss. I count on David to handle the details for me, and he does like the beast of a manager he is. In under an hour, there\u0027s an agreement reached. Things went well—better than I could\u0027ve ever imagined—and tomorrow, we\u0027ll return to recording the album I walked away from four months ago. Perhaps Blake carries some guilt for what he did to me and that\u0027s why he was so willing to negotiate with us. Even I have to admit that he didn\u0027t have to do that; I was the one in breach of our contract. As I\u0027m waiting to catch a ride down, I\u0027m feeling pretty shitty about having just sacrificed myself and everything I believe for the sake of making my dreams come true. But it\u0027s the viciousness of the industry. Sometimes we have to do things we don\u0027t want to do in order to get ahead. I just have to get through this recording and then hope I never have to lay eyes on Blake Phillips\u0027s ass again. I step into the tiny space that\u0027ll take me to the ground floor. Blake follows again, and there\u0027s nothing I can do but ride down with him. We\u0027re alone, but I don\u0027t expect him to stand there and say nothing while he stares at me. He slithered in here for a reason. \"I\u0027m glad to have you back.\" Oh, hell to the no. \"Let\u0027s be crystal clear about one thing. You don\u0027t have me back. Not like that.\" \"I just meant that I\u0027m happy you\u0027re home in Nashville where you belong instead of halfway around the world wherever you were.\" Who is he to think he knows where I belong? \"I was nine thousand miles away and it still wasn\u0027t far enough away from you to suit me.\" He runs his finger down my arm. I used to love when he did that, but now it makes me sick. \"Laurie, don\u0027t be that way. You missed me. I know it and you know it.\" I look him dead in the eyes for the first time. \"You\u0027re wrong.\" He smirks and I want to throat punch him. \"You thought going away would get me off your mind but that didn\u0027t happen, did it?\" I start laughing because there\u0027s no possible way to avoid finding this asshat anything but ridiculous. \"I was only in Australia for six hours before I met a real man. I spent three months with him and I assure you that you weren\u0027t on my mind while he was fucking me hard and making me come over and over.\" I see the lust in his eyes as he closes in on me. He forces me into the corner and presses his body against mine. \"Well, it\u0027ll be impossible for him to fuck you hard and make you come from wherever he is, so it looks like you\u0027ll be needing another man for that job.\" Is he seriously suggesting he\u0027d be the man to do that? \"You have someone you\u0027d like to recommend? Because you sure never fucked me hard or made me come once.\" We reach the ground floor and he\u0027s forced to release me before he can respond—or retaliate. The doors slide open not a second too soon and I quickly scramble out. I don\u0027t have to look to know he\u0027s hot on my heels. His presence behind me is like a bad feeling I can\u0027t shake. I unlock my car with the keyless remote but he\u0027s on me before I can get inside. He grabs me from behind and pulls me against him—just like Jack Henry would, except much rougher. I can feel that he\u0027s hard for me, and it\u0027s sickening. I look around the parking garage, hopeful someone might see what he\u0027s doing. \"Are you crazy, Blake? Anyone could see you doing this. There are cameras everywhere.\" His mouth is at my ear and I feel his breath on my skin. My hair stands on end at the back of my neck; my scalp prickles. \"I don\u0027t care if anyone sees us, Laurie. I\u0027ve missed you so much and I made a decision while we were apart. I\u0027m ready to leave Beth so we can be together.\" The hell he is. \"No, you\u0027re not.\" \"I am. I swear.\" \"No, Blake. You don\u0027t understand. I didn\u0027t say that because I didn\u0027t believe you. I said it because I don\u0027t want you.\" His hold on me tightens and he kisses my neck. \"I want you, Laurie,\" he pleads. \"I didn\u0027t realize how much until I didn\u0027t have you in my life. Please, don\u0027t make the mistake of ending us before we\u0027ve had a chance to be happy together.\" \"This is insane. You\u0027re talking to me like we broke up over a simple indiscretion. You have a wife and she wasn\u0027t the transgression—I was. Not to mention that our whole relationship was based on a lie.\" \"Baby, I have faults. I\u0027m not perfect.\" \"Don\u0027t call me baby.\" Jack Henry is the only one I want calling me that. \"And no husband and father should ever refer to his wife and children as faults.\" He turns me around to face him. \"All of this is about him—that Australian bastard I talked to on your phone. He\u0027s the reason you\u0027re blowing me off—because you still want him.\" \"I will always want him.\" Blake\u0027s face changes and is no longer soft or wanting. It\u0027s angry. \"Do you want him more than you want your career?\" I think he\u0027s threatening me, but I want to hear him say it. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" \"Exactly what you think it means. You know how easily I can end you, so you have two choices: either come back to me or your career is over. Simple as that.\" I stare at him, astonished. I can\u0027t believe he\u0027s capable of such a ruthless threat. He says that he\u0027s giving me two choices but that\u0027s horseshit and we both know it. He\u0027s trying to bully me back into his bed. It infuriates me so much that I have a knee-jerk reaction—as in I jerk my knee up into his balls as hard as I can—and he\u0027s instantly face down on the concrete of the parking garage. I jump into my car and slam my hand down over the lock because I don\u0027t know where his head\u0027s at. My hands are shaking so badly, I fumble to get the key into the ignition. My old Honda roars to life and I feel a streak of something—maybe strength—and decide I\u0027m not finished with Blake yet. I want to run over him but decide that probably isn\u0027t the best idea, so I lower my window instead. \"You can take my songs you\u0027re holding hostage—along with our contract—and shove them all up your ass. And when you get your balls out of your gut, sue me for breach of contract so I can tell the world what a cheating, lying little prick you are. And a fucking lousy-ass lay. As in terrible!\" I leave half the rubber of my tires behind as I spin out and immediately begin to panic. What did I just do? Who am I kidding? There\u0027s no mistaking it—I just killed my career. I thought I\u0027d hit rock bottom before but I couldn\u0027t have been more wrong. This place I now reside is one level of hell below it. I walk like a zombie through my apartment until I reach my bedroom and fall backward onto my bed. I sigh as I stare at the ceiling and watch the oscillating blades of the fan, thinking about how they remind me of my life. Each blade is chasing the one in front of it but it\u0027s a fruitless race. None of them will ever catch up to the one ahead. The story of my life. I chase the happiness right in front of my face but it always outruns me, no matter how fast I am. I lie like that for a while before I eventually drift off. I have no idea how long I\u0027ve been asleep when my phone wakes me with the \"Jolene\" ringtone. Fabulous. Jolie Prescott is exactly what I need right now. I contemplate letting it go to voicemail but I know she\u0027ll only continue to call. Persistence—it\u0027s one of her gifts. \"Hi, Mom.\" \"Laurie, I\u0027ve been waiting all day for you to call with an update on your meeting with David and Blake. Why haven\u0027t I heard from you?\" It was a mistake to tell her I was meeting with them. I don\u0027t want to talk about this right now, but she\u0027s not going to give me a choice. She never does. That\u0027s another one of her talents but it doesn\u0027t mean I won\u0027t try to get out of it. That\u0027s one of my skills. \"It\u0027s a long story and I don\u0027t really want to talk about it right now. Maybe we can get together a little later and discuss it.\" \"That means it didn\u0027t go well. Please come over. We need to talk about this so we can get a game plan on where we should go from here.\" I love that—where we should go from here. She had a real presence in the industry at one time and knows the ins and outs of how things work. Maybe she\u0027ll have some ideas on which direction I should go because I damn sure don\u0027t know which end is up at this point. But I\u0027m not going if her lover boy is hanging around. \"He\u0027s not there, is he?\" \"No, Laurelyn. He\u0027s not here.\" She says it like she\u0027s annoyed I don\u0027t want to be around him. \"Okay. I\u0027ll be over after I change.\" I end my call and pull on jogging pants that read LOVE across the ass—the very same ones Jack Henry enjoyed shoving to my knees when he bent me over the arm of Ben\u0027s couch. I don\u0027t care how old or gray I get, I will always carry that memory with me. But just in case, I\u0027m gonna write it down in a journal so my nurse can read it to me if I get Alzheimer\u0027s. I might not remember it was me in the story, but I\u0027ll think some lady sure got lucky. And yet, I don\u0027t need a journal to record our story. Every song I write from here on out will be about Jack Henry. That\u0027s how our tale will go on and on forever—through my music. He will always be every song I sing. I find my mom in her living room. Her home is humble, its decor simple. Most of her furnishings are from bargain stores, so I wonder what the famous Jake Beckett must think about it while he\u0027s slumming. She takes one look at me and I can tell by her expression that she thinks I look like hell—because I do. She hasn\u0027t seen me in two weeks, so I\u0027m certain my weight loss and the dark circles catch her attention. \"Laurelyn Paige! What\u0027s happened to you? Have you been sick? Did you catch something while you were on your trip?\" I sure did. It\u0027s called being lovesick. I would expect her out of everyone to recognize this look.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-5.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
