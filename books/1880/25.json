He pushes my knees apart and the thought of what he\u0027s seeing strikes me. I\u0027m naked with my legs spread wide apart in the daylight. This is why he wanted me to close my eyes. He knew I\u0027d feel uncomfortable in this position with him staring at my stuff.\\n\\n It\u0027s only a few seconds later when I hear the buzz. I didn\u0027t use the things enough to know if there\u0027s a difference in the sounds they make, so I have no idea which one he\u0027s going to use.\\n\\n I\u0027m shaking with anticipation when I feel the vibration touch me. He starts at the top and slowly drags it down one side before bringing it up again. \"Do you like that?\"\\n\\n I lift the pillow ever so slightly to take a peek at him. \"You know I do.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\"\\n\\n He moves to the other side and repeats the same movement. When he finishes, he slides what I\u0027ve decided is the Bullet through my suddenly drenched center. Every time he brings it up, he directly hits my clit for only the briefest time. It\u0027s not enough to make me come, but it\u0027s enough to make me want to so badly, I\u0027m ready to scream if I don\u0027t. I\u0027m certain he\u0027s aware of this because he knows my body so well and he\u0027s doing it to tease me mercilessly. \"What about that?\"\\n\\n This time I don\u0027t lift the pillow because I\u0027m squeezing it too tightly. \"That feels amazing.\"\\n\\n \"Perfect. I\u0027m going to throw in a little something else to spice things up.\"\\n\\n Good grief! What else could he do to spice this up?\\n\\n I feel him enter me before the question is even completed in my head. He\u0027s moving in and out of me and I feel the vibrations of the Bullet circling my clit over and over. It\u0027s only enough to push me to the edge without falling over, but I know it won\u0027t last much longer. \"I\u0027m gonna beat you there, buddy.\"\\n\\n He pounds into me harder and faster. \"You wanna bet on that? Tell me how close you are.\"\\n\\n \"Pretty close. I can see the finish line.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m right there with you, baby.\"\\n\\n Just when I think it\u0027s going to take a little more to push me over the edge, he cups his fingers over me and the Bullet and presses it so that it vibrates against the whole area from my clit down to where he\u0027s inside me.\\n\\n And that\u0027s when the postman delivers. Oh my God, is it ever magnificent!\\n\\n I feel his hand wrap around one of my hips as he jerks me toward him so he can drive harder inside me those last few times as he comes. When he grits my name out from between his teeth, I want to scream, but I can\u0027t. I\u0027m speechless because the waves and spasms deep within have robbed me of my voice.\\n\\n When it\u0027s over, my arms drop lifelessly to the bed and the pillow remains over my face. He pulls out of me but I feel his hands on my knees continuing to hold them apart. \"You\u0027re so beautiful.\"\\n\\n \"How can you tell? My face is covered,\" I mumble from under the pillow.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m talking about.\"\\n\\n Oh, shit! He\u0027s saying my baby hatcher is beautiful?\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so weird!\"\\n\\n \"Never claimed I wasn\u0027t,\" he laughs.\\n\\n I take the pillow from my face and smack him with it. \"Get your weird ass up and shower so we can go to the grocery store. I\u0027m hungry.\"\\n\\n Jack Henry and I are strolling through the market, both in jeans with T\u0027s, but he\u0027s wearing a ball cap for a team I\u0027ve never heard of so I assume they\u0027re Australian. He\u0027s pushing the cart as I walk beside him. I\u0027m tossing stuff from the shelves into the basket and I can\u0027t remember a time when I\u0027ve ever felt more domestic in my life. And I like it.\\n\\n Mrs. Porcelli continued to do all of the shopping after I moved in, so this is the first time we\u0027ve been in a grocery store together. I suspect it\u0027s the first time Jack Henry has been inside a market in years, but he seems content to be here with me.\\n\\n I\u0027m reaching for something on the shelf when I feel his arms snake around me from behind. \"What\u0027s for dinner tonight?\"\\n\\n He\u0027s obviously not been paying attention to the things I\u0027ve been throwing into the cart or he\u0027d have already figured it out. \"I seem to recall you having a thing for my lasagna.\"\\n\\n \"So good, it brought me to my knees.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t the lasagna that did that,\" I laugh. \"But I\u0027ll cook it for you, if that\u0027s what you want.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, please. And we\u0027ll stop for wine on the way home.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m about to tell him no one in town carries his wine when I hear \"Jolene\" ringing from my back pocket. \"That\u0027s my mom. I haven\u0027t spoken to her in a while. I probably should take it. She\u0027ll keep calling if I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n He kisses the top of my head before releasing me and I reach for my phone. \"Hey, Mom.\"\\n\\n \"I was calling to check on my baby girl. I wanted to see how life on the road was treating you.\"\\n\\n I dread this. \"I\u0027m not on the road. I\u0027m back in Nashville.\"\\n\\n \"Why? Did something happen?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Something bad happened. Blake Phillips attacked me last night. I got banged up a little bit, so Randy thought it would be best to cancel our shows for the rest of the week. We only had a few left anyway.\"\\n\\n \"What did he do to you?\" I hear the horror in her voice.\\n\\n I\u0027m standing in front of Jack Henry in the middle of a grocery store. This is definitely not the time or place I want to have this conversation. \"I\u0027m buying groceries right now. Would it be okay if I call you when I get home?\"\\n\\n \"No. Your dad and I are coming over so you can tell us exactly what that man did to you.\"\\n\\n Dammit. She has a key to my apartment and I don\u0027t want her to beat me there and wander into my bedroom. I\u0027m not sure we put the toys back in my nightstand drawer. \"No, Mom. Don\u0027t do that. Why don\u0027t you wait until a little later? I\u0027ll need to put away the groceries. Maybe you can come for dinner.\" I look at Jack Henry and shrug. \"But I have someone staying with me. Jack Henry is here.\"\\n\\n \"Your Aussie guy?\"\\n\\n I look at Jack Henry and smile as I answer, \"Yeah, Mom. My Aussie guy.\" Hearing me say that makes him beam.\\n\\n \"And I suspect you\u0027re happy about that?\" Something about the way she asks makes me think she\u0027s not pleased to learn that he\u0027s here.\\n\\n Happy is a severe understatement. \"I am. Very much so.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Your dad and I will come for dinner and meet your boyfriend. What time?\"\\n\\n \"Does six o\u0027clock work?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. See you then.\"\\n\\n I end my call and look at Jack Henry. \"We won\u0027t be dining alone.\"\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t look thrilled. \"I gathered as much. I knew I\u0027d have to meet her at some point. Tonight is as good as any.\"\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t sound thrilled, either. \"What do you mean you\u0027d have to meet her at some point? You sound like you already don\u0027t like her.\"\\n\\n \"She treats you poorly. It\u0027s been tolerable from a distance because I didn\u0027t have a choice, but now I\u0027m here. I won\u0027t put up with anyone mistreating you, and that includes her. I don\u0027t care if she is your mum.\"\\n\\n Geez. I\u0027m predicting this night isn\u0027t going to go well. \"It isn\u0027t just her. My dad\u0027s coming too. We haven\u0027t talked about this, but they\u0027re sort of back on again.\" What am I doing? This is Jack Henry. I don\u0027t have to pretend this is anything but what it is. \"He\u0027s still married and they\u0027re sleeping together.\" It sounds so dirty when I say it and I\u0027m not sure which reason makes it that way—if it\u0027s the married part or the fact that they\u0027re my parents.\\n\\n \"Perfect. Another parent to set straight. I can get them both knocked out at the same time.\"\\n\\n This is going to be awful. \"You\u0027re not setting anyone straight tonight. I want them to like you and I highly doubt they will if you tell them what shitty parents they\u0027ve been.\"\\n\\n He looks at me like he wants to argue but doesn\u0027t. \"I won\u0027t tonight, but only because you ask it of me. It\u0027s gonna be hard as hell to keep my mouth shut.\"\\n\\n \"You can do it,\" I encourage. \"I know you can. And every time they say something that pisses you off and you don\u0027t react, I\u0027ll reward you with something special after they leave.\"\\n\\n \"Bribery.\"\\n\\n \"I prefer to call it a reward system.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I do enjoy your rewards, so maybe this will work out well for me after all.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m about to tell him how I figured he\u0027d see things my way when I hear the voice of a young girl. \"Miss McLachlan?\"\\n\\n I turn at the sound of my name—my stage name, that is—and see a young teen girl staring at me. \"Oh. My. God. You\u0027re the singer from Southern Ophelia, aren\u0027t you? I\u0027m a huge fan. Can I get your autograph?\"\\n\\n I\u0027m still not used to this and it\u0027s awkward. \"Umm…sure.\"\\n\\n She digs through her purse and seems to come up empty-handed. \"What about my shirt? Would you sign it?\"\\n\\n It\u0027s not like I\u0027ve never signed a shirt before, but it\u0027s usually after a concert. And it isn\u0027t being worn. It feels a little unnerving to be recognized out like this. \"No problem.\"\\n\\n When I\u0027m finished signing, she passes her phone to Jack Henry. \"Would you mind getting a picture of us?\"\\n\\n He pulls his hands out of his pockets and takes the phone from her. \"Anything for one of Miss McLachlan\u0027s fans.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the round button in the center. But I guess you already know that. I bet you have to do this all the time,\" she giggles.\\n\\n He looks like the cat that swallowed the canary. \"I take some mighty fine pictures of Miss McLachlan, if I do say so myself.\"\\n\\n I try my best to keep from laughing at his sly remark about taking my almost-nudie pictures. He\u0027s such a naughty boy and I\u0027ll get him for it later.\\n\\n \"Thank you so much, Miss McLachlan. My friends aren\u0027t going to believe I ran into you like this.\"\\n\\n When the girl is gone, Jack Henry is grinning from ear to ear. I can\u0027t help but wonder what\u0027s on his mind. \"What\u0027s with the shit-eating grin?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-25.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \\n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \\n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
