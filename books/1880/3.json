Her hands slide up and down my chest. \"I\u0027m glad I stumbled upon you. You are super-hot.\" Her mouth starts at my upper chest and makes its way down to my stomach. She tugs to open the button of my trousers and then pulls the zipper down. I\u0027m drunk as fuck, but I somehow manage to get it up. \"Well, well. It could be a happy birthday for me after all.\" She tugs until all my clothes are a rumpled memory on the floor. After she finishes, she pushes her knickers down and kicks them to where her dress is lying in a puddle. She climbs back on top of me and produces a condom from somewhere. I assume from her own supply since she hasn\u0027t asked me where mine is. I hear her tear it open and then feel her hands rolling it down over me. I reach up to rub my closed eyes because all I can see is Laurelyn in the pitch black behind my lids. Dammit! I want to forget her and I know this is the way, so why is it not working? Why am I still seeing her? Missing her? Loving her? I feel the blonde\u0027s hand around me and know she\u0027s going to slide onto my cock any second if I don\u0027t stop her, so I jerk up in the bed and shove her off. \"I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t do this with you.\" I get up and start dressing as she stares at me. She says nothing and when I\u0027m fully clothed, I don\u0027t glance in her direction. \"The room is paid for. You can stay if you want.\" When I\u0027m outside the door, I take my mobile from my pocket but it isn\u0027t Daniel I call. I want to talk to my brother; I need him. \"Evan, I need you to come get me.\" \"Do you know what time it is?\" he grumbles. \"No, and I don\u0027t give a shit. Come pick me up at the Langford.\" I get into the passenger side of my brother\u0027s kiddie-hauling SUV. He takes one look at me and shakes his head as he begins laughing. \"You look like shit.\" Just what I need to hear. \"Fuck you.\" He looks me over. \"What the hell have you been doing?\" I stare out the window. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\" \"Well, then why did you call me to come get you at this time of night if you didn\u0027t want to talk? It\u0027s not like you don\u0027t have Daniel on salary to drive your drunk arse home.\" I\u0027m starting to regret calling him. I don\u0027t know what I was thinking. \"Maybe I should have.\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s right. Maybe you should have.\" He pulls out onto the street in the direction of my apartment. \"When did you get back into town?\" \"Today.\" \"Mum\u0027s going nuts trying to get you. She\u0027s dying to know what happened with Laurelyn.\" I don\u0027t reply. \"That\u0027s what all of this is about, isn\u0027t it? You asked her to stay and she told you no.\" \"You\u0027re wrong.\" \"Then what happened?\" It hurts to say it. \"She left without telling me goodbye.\" \"Fuck! That bitch is cold.\" \"Don\u0027t call her that,\" I warn my brother. \"You don\u0027t know anything about the way it went down.\" \"Does it matter if she fucked off without telling you so much as kiss my arse?\" \"Yeah, it sort of does matter. It makes all the difference in the world. We had a complicated relationship topped off with a stupid misunderstanding.\" \"How complicated could it be? She was here for three months. You hung out, had a good time, and she went home.\" I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m about to tell him the truth. Maybe it\u0027s because I\u0027m drunk. I don\u0027t know. \"It was much more than that. We had an agreement. She didn\u0027t know my real name. I didn\u0027t know hers. She was supposed to be my companion for three months until she went home. I insisted, and she agreed, we\u0027d never have contact again once she was gone. But things didn\u0027t go according to plan. I found out her first name. She found out my whole name. She told me she loved me but I was too stubborn to hear her because I\u0027m a fucking idiot. She couldn\u0027t tell me goodbye and I let her get away without telling her how I felt.\" \"So, you find her and tell her.\" He thinks it\u0027s so easy. \"That\u0027s sort of hard to do when you don\u0027t know the full name of who you\u0027re searching for.\" \"Bro, that is messed up. Why would you do that?\" Evan doesn\u0027t get what my life is like. He walked away from the vineyards and chose a simple life with a nine-to-five job so he could have Emma. \"Because women love rich men. I grew tired of being used. I\u0027ve been doing this for years and it\u0027s always worked out fine. Until Laurelyn.\" \"She didn\u0027t know who you were or that you had a shitload of money?\" \"Not until I brought her home with me after Dad got sick.\" \"Mum is going to be so pissed off. She was already planning your wedding and naming your kids.\" He didn\u0027t have to remind me. \"I know. She fell as much in love with Laurelyn as I did.\" \"So did my wife and kids. Celia still talks about her. Mila probably would if she could talk.\" I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m about to ask him this. \"How did you know Emma was the one?\" He hesitates and I wonder if he\u0027s going to tell me. I can\u0027t say I\u0027d blame him if he refused. \"You can\u0027t use anything I tell you against me. I mean it. No throwing this shit up in my face later because you think it\u0027s funny.\" \"No, man. You have my word.\" \"We\u0027d dated for several months but had broken up over something stupid. I saw her out with another guy. I don\u0027t know how to describe the way it felt. Hurt. Sick. Pissed off. Desperate. And that\u0027s just the short list. All he had to do was look at her and I wanted to choke the shit out of him with my bare hands.\" I think of how I\u0027d been out of my mind with jealousy the past three months. I wanted to beat the hell out of Ben Donavon, Swinger Chris, and Blake Phillips. \"Yeah, that sounds more than a little bit familiar.\" \"Jack, you don\u0027t always know the true worth of a woman\u0027s love until it becomes a memory.\" That\u0027s pretty deep stuff coming from my little brother. \"Nothing speaks louder than your heart. Listen to what it\u0027s telling you. You don\u0027t need me to tell you how you\u0027ll know if she\u0027s the one.\" \"My heart\u0027s not telling me anything. It\u0027s screaming in desperation to find Laurelyn and tell her how much I love her.\" \"Bro, you\u0027re a rich fucker. Call out the bloodhounds and go get your girl. She can be found for the right amount of money.\" Evan\u0027s right. Laurelyn can be located for a price, and I know just the guy for the job. It\u0027s late, but I don\u0027t care. I take my mobile out and dial the familiar number. \"Callaghan Investigations.\" \"Jim, it\u0027s Jack McLachlan. I have a job for you, and it\u0027s a big one. Do you have a current passport?\" The doorbell rings and I open my eyes, cursing the sunlight that mocks me through the window. I reach my hand out as I\u0027ve done every morning for the last week and find the spot next to me empty. Even after a full week, I\u0027m still not used to finding her gone. My head pounds after getting so smashed last night, and the zealous ringing of the doorbell isn\u0027t helping matters. I want to yell for the person to stop and go away but I know raising my voice will only make things worse. The nightstand clock glows 7:18. Granted, this is sleeping in for me, but who the hell would be at my apartment this early on a Saturday morning? No one knows I\u0027m in Sydney except Evan, so it can only mean one thing. He told Mum, and now she\u0027s here to jump my shit because he still thinks it\u0027s funny as hell to get me in trouble with her. That\u0027s what I get for calling that little fucker. I open the front door and Margaret McLachlan storms past me. Oh, fuck! This isn\u0027t going to go well. \"Please come in, Mum.\" \"Don\u0027t give me your smart-arse mouth. I\u0027ve been trying to reach you all week and you\u0027ve avoided my calls. It\u0027s a shame I had to hunt you down like this just to find out what happened.\" \"It\u0027s harvest time. I don\u0027t have to tell you how busy things can get.\" \"It\u0027s been days since Laurelyn was scheduled to leave and I haven\u0027t heard from you. I\u0027ve been about to lose my mind wanting to know what\u0027s gone on, but since you\u0027ve been avoiding me, I\u0027m fairly certain I can guess. You screwed it up with her, didn\u0027t you?\" And here we go. \"Yes. I messed up.\" She puts her hands on her hips and looks up toward the ceiling as she sighs loudly. \"She told you that she loved you?\" How could she know that? Is she guessing? \"Yes.\" \"And what did you tell her in return?\" She\u0027s giving me that look like she\u0027s going to strangle me if I don\u0027t give her the answer she wants. I hope my neck is prepared for the wringing it\u0027s about to receive. \"I didn\u0027t tell her anything.\" And then I fucked her. She seems surprised by my lack of response for Laurelyn\u0027s confession of love. \"Oh. Then it seems I owe you an apology. I went to see her a few weeks ago at Avalon. She told me she loved you—and I thought you felt the same—so I encouraged her to tell you. I wouldn\u0027t have done that if I\u0027d known you didn\u0027t have feelings for her.\" \"But I do, Mum. I love Laurelyn very much.\" I see the confusion on her face. \"Then I don\u0027t understand. Why did you not tell her and ask her to stay? It would\u0027ve been the perfect opportunity.\" I doubt she\u0027s going to take this well. \"I don\u0027t date women who say those kinds of things so I was caught off guard. I thought about it night and day for a week and I was finally able to admit to myself how I felt. I was on my way to tell her about my feelings, to ask her if she\u0027d stay, when I discovered she was gone without a goodbye. Mum, she left without knowing that I love her.\" Her expression tells me she isn\u0027t pleased. \"I don\u0027t understand. It\u0027s been a week. Why have you not gone after her? Or at least called to declare your love?\" This is it. I can\u0027t lie my way out of what happened with Laurelyn. More importantly, I don\u0027t want to anymore. I despise lies and pretending; they cost me the woman I love.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-3.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
