I wanted to see your beautiful face, but then I sniffed your knickers right before we connected and now I\u0027ve got a massive hard-on I need to do something about. I could really use your assistance here, babe.\" She\u0027s laughing at me. \"You sniffed my panties?\" \"Yeah. I stole some you\u0027d worn because I\u0027m so fucking addicted to the smell of your snatch.\" She\u0027s looking at me with what I think is disbelief because I\u0027ve said those words to her. \"You and I both know I\u0027m a dirty bastard, so you don\u0027t even have to say it.\" \"My snatch?\" she asks. \"Yeah. I love you—and your snatch is part of you—so there\u0027s not a damn thing wrong with me loving it too. And I do. Wholeheartedly.\" I can see that she\u0027s leaving the kitchen table. \"What are you doing?\" \"Well, I can\u0027t very well strip naked in my kitchen. And I need jams. You know I have to have sexy-time music if I\u0027m going to get naked for you.\" Oh, fuck yes! \"Whoa, wait a minute. I\u0027m in my office and I need to lock the door because I will fire anyone who walks in here while we\u0027re getting busy.\" \"You do know we won\u0027t actually be getting busy, right?\" \"Baby, I have an imagination and I\u0027m gonna use it,\" I call out as I get up and walk over to lock the door. I turn the knob and pull on it for reassurance. This is not an occasion when Mrs. Porcelli needs to come in and quiz me about what I want to eat. I\u0027m back at my desk with one raging hard-on and she hasn\u0027t taken off a stitch of clothing yet. \"I\u0027m ready when you are.\" I hear a slow, seductive song begin to play in the background, but I don\u0027t see her. A moment later she reappears and begins to slowly sway to the music as she sheds her shirt over her head. She tosses it somewhere in the room and I recognize the white lace bra she\u0027s wearing. I know the matching knickers—string bikinis with the tiniest scrap of material to cover her. She reaches around to unfasten her bra—something I always do for her—and she lets it drop to the floor. Her tits are so damn beautiful. I haven\u0027t seen or touched them in a week and it\u0027s killing me. \"Touch \u0027em for me.\" She takes her hands and grasps them from the bottom and sides to push them together. Her teeth graze her bottom lip as she uses her thumb and index finger to roll her nipples. \"You like that, don\u0027t \u0027cha?\" \"Indeed I do, but I like it so much better when it\u0027s me doing it.\" This brings a grin to her face. \"Me too.\" She moves her hands slowly down her stomach until she reaches the button on her jeans and pops it open. \"Oops. Look what happened there.\" She slides her zipper down and begins to shimmy out of her pants and undies. \"Tsk. Tsk. I hate when my clothes fall off like that.\" Mmm. She\u0027s so fucking hot standing there naked for my eyes only. I can\u0027t help myself. I have to get some relief so I unzip and start doing what Laurelyn would do for me if she were here. \"Touch yourself and pretend it\u0027s me.\" \"You\u0027re ordering up some extra dirty with a side of kink today,\" she says as she walks backward to sit on the bed. She slides back and spreads her legs so I have a perfectly clear view when she touches herself. \"You want to see me touch this?\" \"Oh, yeah. That\u0027s it.\" I watch her rubbing herself and I remember exactly what it felt like when my fingers did exactly what hers are doing now. \"This has to be the sweetest torment I\u0027ve ever endured.\" I start wanking off faster because I just need it to be over. I never thought I\u0027d feel that way, but I\u0027m in misery. \"I know that face,\" she teases. \"I think my boy is about to come.\" \"I damn sure hope so because I\u0027m about to fucking…die…here.\" It\u0027s only a moment later that I come hard and fast, just the way I need to. I lean my head back against my office chair and enjoy my release. It\u0027s not what I get when I\u0027m with Laurelyn, but it\u0027s the next best thing. I\u0027ll take what I can get at this point. \"The boy has rounded third and…yes! We have a home run, ladies and gentlemen.\" I laugh because I don\u0027t know another woman who would coach her boy on like that. And I definitely don\u0027t know who would get naked and touch themselves so someone else could get off. \"Thank you, babe. You don\u0027t know how much I needed that.\" \"I bet I do. I may or may not be putting the Bullet to a lot of use these days.\" I don\u0027t know how I feel about that. \"The Bullet\u0027s fine, but don\u0027t use the other one. I don\u0027t want anything inside you but me.\" \"You\u0027re being silly. A vibrator could never replace you.\" I hope not but I don\u0027t want to take any chances. \"It won\u0027t if you don\u0027t use it. I hear that women can become desensitized to normal sexual touch when they use those things too much. They can\u0027t orgasm with a man, and I don\u0027t want that to happen because I plan on being the one to make you come. A lot.\" \"I want you to make me come so you shouldn\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not a fan of anything being inside me except you.\" \"Perfect. That\u0027s exactly what I want to hear.\" Chapter Twenty-Seven Six weeks down. Six weeks to go. And it sucks. Major. Life on the road isn\u0027t at all what I thought it would be. I wasn\u0027t naïve. I knew traveling all the time would be brutal, but I imagined the love of the fans would make up for all the negatives. Don\u0027t get me wrong; they\u0027re great, but home isn\u0027t a rolling tour bus or a different hotel each night. This life doesn\u0027t cut it for me. Maybe I wouldn\u0027t feel this way if I didn\u0027t know the love of my life was waiting for me to come to him. But I do know, and it\u0027s making me miserable. It\u0027s getting worse every day and I feel like I could be falling into some kind of depression. We talk every day without fail—and sometimes have a little naughty time via video chat—but it doesn\u0027t make being apart easier. I\u0027m terrified he\u0027s going to grow tired of what we\u0027re doing and decide he doesn\u0027t want to continue with our long-distance relationship because he needs something tangible and I can\u0027t be that from so far away. He seems okay with the way things are—for now. I know that won\u0027t last forever, but I don\u0027t need it to last for much longer. I only need six more weeks—forty-two more days—and we can be together forever. Seven weeks down. Five weeks to go. And it still sucks. Five shows a week, a different city every night. I\u0027m exhausted and I hate what I\u0027m doing, but it\u0027s a commitment I agreed to fulfill. I want to be a rat and walk out on the band, but I won\u0027t because that\u0027s not who I am. I love these guys and I want to see them succeed. If I walk out now without a replacement, it could ruin them. I won\u0027t do that as long as Jack Henry agrees to wait for me. If he says he\u0027s done before I can make it to him, then I\u0027m done here. I won\u0027t sacrifice us or our love for Southern Ophelia or anything else. Eight weeks down. Four weeks to go. Still sucking. I\u0027m worried about Jack Henry and me. He didn\u0027t call last night. When I finally reached him this morning, he said there was a problem at Chalice and he had to leave immediately. But he could\u0027ve called during the drive there. It\u0027s Audrey. She continues to make herself present in his life and that\u0027s a problem for me because I\u0027m not there to know what\u0027s happening. He allowed her to be the reason we didn\u0027t talk, and I\u0027m uneasy about that. I hate this. Nine weeks down. Three weeks to go. And it\u0027s worse this week. I missed Jack Henry\u0027s call last night. I was so exhausted that I fell asleep waiting for his call and didn\u0027t wake when he tried to reach me. His words were cold this morning when we finally talked. He asked me what I was doing last night, as if he suspected I might be up to no good. This isn\u0027t working, and I\u0027m beginning to fear what our future holds if I don\u0027t go to him soon. Ten weeks down. Two weeks to go. And today is the worst yet. Fourteen days. I can hang in there because I know there\u0027s light at the end of the tunnel, but Jack Henry doesn\u0027t. I can tell he\u0027s getting close to being at the end of his rope. I want to walk away from this now, but I remind myself that I can do that soon enough all while keeping my word. I can do this. I just have to keep telling myself that over and over. Eleven weeks down. One week to go. I\u0027m going to make it now and we\u0027re going to be fine. I can\u0027t wait to talk to Jack Henry tonight. He doesn\u0027t know it, but I\u0027ll be back in his arms in seven days. I can\u0027t wait to see his face when he realizes I\u0027m home. For good. I just finished a show but thinking about being with him in a week gets me turned on, so I think it\u0027ll be a video chat night instead of a phone call. I send him a text to let him know I\u0027ll be contacting him in ten minutes and he better be ready for me. When we make a connection, I see he\u0027s in his office—the place that\u0027s become our sexual playroom since it\u0027s usually morning for him when we talk. \"I hope you have the door locked because I\u0027m feeling particularly naughty.\" \"Baby, I need to talk to you about something serious.\" Shit! I don\u0027t like the sound of that. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Something has happened. I don\u0027t know what it is but my mind spins with thoughts of him finding another woman or telling me we\u0027re over because he can\u0027t do this anymore. \"You\u0027re scaring me.\" \"Something happened last night.\" \"What?\" Please don\u0027t let him tell me he tripped and fell into bed with someone else. My heart is racing in my throat and I suddenly feel nauseated. I\u0027m terrified of the path this conversation is heading. \"Audrey was in the house again.\" Oh, hell to the no. \"You are kidding me!\" \"I wish I were. I came home from work yesterday evening and had dinner alone like I always do. I had a couple of coldies while I watched TV and went to take a shower before bed.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-37.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
