{"id":83726,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"I love my family and Addison, but there\u0027s not a shade of doubt in my mind. I\u0027d be on the first Aussie bird I could find if Jack Henry called and asked me to come back. Maybe I feel that way because I no longer have a career, but I wouldn\u0027t even take the time to pack a bag if it meant I could be back in his arms sooner. \"He wouldn\u0027t have to ask me twice.\" \"I wish I had your confidence. I\u0027m just so unsure…of everything.\" It\u0027s easier to be confident in answer to a question I won\u0027t hear. Jack Henry will never ask me to return to Australia. I\u0027ll never have to choose between him and my career because I have neither. And it\u0027s a cruel reality to face. I wake to the sound of a knock on my bedroom door. Addison slowly eases it open. \"Are you awake?\" \"Yeah,\" I lie as I push myself up to a sitting position. Last night was a bad one for me. I tossed and turned most of the night, thinking about Jack Henry. There\u0027s no way I\u0027ve been asleep for more than a couple of hours, but I don\u0027t want Addison to feel bad about waking me. \"What\u0027s up?\" She walks over and sits on the edge of my bed. \"I never went to sleep last night.\" My contacts are out so she looks blurry, but I can see the troubled expression on her face. \"Are you worried about the audition?\" \"No way. I couldn\u0027t care less about that. It\u0027s Zac. I can\u0027t stop thinking about us and how bad I want to go back.\" I can\u0027t believe her. If she loves him the way she says, she shouldn\u0027t stick around here and let him slip away. \"Then do it. Stop being miserable and go.\" \"You really think I should?\" I wouldn\u0027t hesitate. \"Absolutely. You love him and that\u0027s not going to go away.\" I know that much from experience. She reaches for my hand and squeezes it. \"I\u0027m gonna do it, but I want you to go to that audition instead of me.\" Has she lost her mind? That\u0027s not the way things are done in the music industry. I don\u0027t get to decide I\u0027ll go in her place. \"I can\u0027t show up for your audition.\" \"Yes, you can. Get up and get dressed. You have an hour.\" \"No. No. No, I can\u0027t do that.\" Can I? \"They\u0027re expecting a female vocalist. That\u0027s what you are—and a great one. They won\u0027t care about the details after they hear you sing. And it\u0027s actually a pretty perfect situation, if you think about it. They need a singer who can play guitar. You need a job. Problem solved.\" It\u0027s been over two weeks since I sang or played. \"I haven\u0027t rehearsed.\" \"Choose something familiar like…\u0027What Hurts the Most.\u0027 You\u0027ve been performing that song longer than we\u0027ve known each other. It\u0027s one of your best and you can knock it out of the park without even warming up.\" She\u0027s right. It\u0027s always one of my best performances. It could work. Gah! Am I really considering this? \"We both know this stunt is nuts. Even if they like my voice, this is unprofessional. And desperate. They\u0027ll tell me to get lost.\" \"I\u0027ll go with you. We\u0027ll act like I\u0027m there for the audition and you\u0027re there to support me. We\u0027ll swap places at the last minute.\" She makes it sound so easy—and so hard to say no. \"I\u0027m gonna do it. What do I have to lose at this point?\" \"Nothing.\" She\u0027s right. When you have nothing, there\u0027s very little for you to lose. \"I have to get ready.\" We\u0027re called back into a studio and I\u0027m nervous as hell. This isn\u0027t me trying out for some mediocre band playing small clubs. These guys are doing it big time. Addison introduces herself and I stand back as she drops the bomb. \"I won\u0027t be the one auditioning today.\" She gestures over her shoulder. \"She\u0027s here to sing in my place.\" There\u0027s a brief moment of silence before the guy I recognize as the vocalist speaks up. \"I don\u0027t think so—that\u0027s not how things work around here. Addison Donavon is the person we\u0027re expecting. That\u0027s who our agent lined up, so there are no exceptions. We don\u0027t play tag team.\" I knew this was a bad idea. I\u0027m on the verge of turning around to walk out the door but Addison isn\u0027t ready to cave. \"My manager arranged this audition for me before I knew I\u0027d be leaving the country. Doesn\u0027t it seem ridiculous to let this audition go to waste when what you need is standing right here in front of you?\" \"We\u0027re not looking for a second-rate replacement.\" It\u0027s obvious who the leader is here by the spokesperson: Mr. Perfect Blond Locks with earrings and tatted forearms. \"That\u0027s not what you have here. She\u0027s an incredible vocalist and musician. She plays by ear—guitar and piano.\" As much as I appreciate Addison listing my virtues, I\u0027m beginning to feel like something of a charity case. I despise it. \"No. She doesn\u0027t have a scheduled audition so she doesn\u0027t get to play or sing unless her manager arranges it.\" Fat chance of that happening since David dropped me after the Blake incident. The arguing continues like that—back and forth—until I finally interrupt. \"It\u0027s okay, Addison. Let\u0027s go.\" \"No! It\u0027s not okay.\" She turns back to the one she\u0027s been arguing with. \"You\u0027re messing up big time if you let her walk out of here.\" This is humiliating, and I refuse to stand here being discussed like I\u0027m not present while Addison pleads for me. I lift my guitar case from the floor and walk toward the door. \"Gentlemen, I\u0027m sorry for any inconvenience I may have caused and I wish you the best of luck in finding the perfect vocalist.\" It\u0027s my polite way of telling them to kiss my ass as well as code for Addison to shut up and come on. I may be a smidgen on the desperate side, but I\u0027ll be damned if I\u0027m gonna beg. I may not have a job or the man I love, but I still have my pride. This band of nitwits isn\u0027t going to rob me of that. \"Have a wonderful afternoon,\" I say with an edge of venom as I turn for the door. And may your crotches be infested with the crabs of a thousand whores. \"Wait.\" I stop as I\u0027m almost out the door and look back to see which one of these jackoffs is talking to me. It\u0027s the leader again—the tall one with the Keith Urban hair. He\u0027s lounging back in his chair and asks the other band members, \"Should we let the little lady entertain us?\" Damn, he\u0027s smug. \"Don\u0027t do me any favors.\" Yeah, I know. I shouldn\u0027t get smart with these guys but I can\u0027t help myself. They\u0027re pissing me off in a bad way, acting like I\u0027m at their mercy. The guy drumming pencils against the desk starts laughing. \"She\u0027s a feisty one. That could be a good sign.\" Blondie motions for me to come back, but my feet don\u0027t move. \"Come on and show us what you can do.\" I\u0027m not quick to jump at his request. I don\u0027t want to look desperate, so I paste on my best poker face and walk casually back toward them. My guitar case thuds atop the conference table and I take out my mom\u0027s worn guitar. I slide the strap over my head and move to a vacant stool. \"What\u0027s your name?\" I think it\u0027s best that I don\u0027t use my real name since I\u0027m in contact with my father now. There\u0027s no way of knowing what\u0027ll happen when his relationship with my mother goes public—and I\u0027m sure it\u0027s only a matter of time before that happens. Those kinds of things don\u0027t stay buried forever, and I can\u0027t risk an association with him that might identify him as my father. I\u0027m put on the spot to come up with a name—just like the night Jack Henry asked me who I was. I immediately think of using \"Paige Beckett,\" but that alias would defeat the whole purpose of avoiding a connection to my paternity. \"Laurelyn Prescott, but I plan on using Paige McLachlan as my stage name.\" I see Addison jerk her head around to look at me. She has to think I\u0027ve flipped my wig. I\u0027ll have to come up with something to tell her. Later. Right now, I have three guys I have to win over with my voice. \"I\u0027m Charlie.\" He\u0027s the lead vocalist, the one I\u0027d sing with. I strum my guitar as he points to the guy with a slick head slouched in a chair, arms crossed. He appears unenthused by my presence. \"That\u0027s Ryan. He plays keyboards and mandolin.\" He moves to the pencil pecker and I already know what he\u0027s gonna say. \"That\u0027s PJ, our drummer.\" I\u0027m still not feeling like Miss Congeniality after my icy welcome, but I smile as I reply, \"Nice to meet you.\" \"What are you gonna play for us?\" I\u0027m confident in my decision. The Rascal Flatts song is the best choice since it has that crossover country pop sound like Southern Ophelia. \"\u0027What Hurts the Most.\u0027\" \"Nice choice.\" I begin playing, singing with my eyes closed. Most people think I do so because of nerves, but that\u0027s not why. I use the time to feel the music and visualize. I transfer to that place so my audience will feel the genuineness of what I\u0027m singing. Finding that spot in my head isn\u0027t going to be difficult; this song has taken on a whole new meaning for me since parting ways with Jack Henry. I\u0027m keeping tempo with my boot heel on the stool\u0027s support rung when I come to the chorus. And that\u0027s when I open my eyes. The three members of Southern Ophelia are watching me intently but I know it\u0027s do or die; this is where I must go in for the kill, and I choose Charlie as my victim since he\u0027s shown himself to be the head of this trio. My eyes meet his and I expose myself fully, using the lyrics as my emotions. I show him my heart and soul—and the dreadful way it looks without Jack Henry. He sees my dark side but only because I allow it. When I finish, there\u0027s a moment of silence before Ryan and PJ take turns complimenting me. Charlie simply stares. Ryan snaps in front of Charlie\u0027s face, and he finally seems to come out of his daze. \"Charlie. What did you think, man?\" I gesture toward the door. \"I can step out and let you talk in private.\" \"I\u0027m pretty sure that won\u0027t be necessary,\" he says as he grins.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-9.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?
