{"id":83727,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\n That\u0027s when I know there\u0027s no decision to be made. I\u0027ve won over the triad of Southern Ophelia.\n Chapter Six\n Three. Long. Fucking. Months. That\u0027s how long it\u0027s been since I\u0027ve seen Laurelyn. And I don\u0027t think I can take another minute. I die a little more each day she isn\u0027t in my life.\n She\u0027s been damn near impossible to find. Fate has worked against us every step of the way. The hoops Jim has jumped through for the smallest bit of information have been ridiculous. One step forward, two steps back—instead of the other way around. A criminal on the run would\u0027ve been easier to find.\n But I\u0027ve finally found her. Laurelyn Paige Prescott—better known to the public by her stage name as Paige McLachlan—that\u0027s the woman I\u0027m here to see tonight.\n I still smile when I think about her taking my name, but I can\u0027t help but ponder why she\u0027d need to use a stage name. She never mentioned using one before and it makes me wonder if something happened with the sperm donor. Or worse—maybe with Blake Phillips.\n I enter the auditorium lobby and the thick crowd makes it difficult to push through. The Martin I\u0027m carrying adds to my difficult navigation as I bump shoulders through the horde, so I have to apologize with each step.\n I find my assigned seat. Because I\u0027m a creature of habit, I\u0027m happy when I see it\u0027s in a dark corner. I sit and place the Martin by my feet. I\u0027m nervous and adrenalized as evidenced by my rapidly beating heart. I\u0027m about to see the woman I love walk out onto that stage.\n I look at the time and see it\u0027s only a minute until eight. My heart is pounding erratically, throbbing in my ears over the loud crowd. Finally, musicians begin filing onto the stage to take their places. That\u0027s when I see her for the first time in three months. My Laurelyn. All the time and distance that separated us disappears upon finally seeing her face again.\n She looks the same, yet different. Her hair is a little longer and darker. Her honey highlights are missing and she\u0027s slimmer. She\u0027s still beautiful as ever but doesn\u0027t fit the image etched in my mind these last few months.\n She\u0027s wearing brown boots—the same ones she wore the first time I saw her—with stonewashed jeans and a strapless white top. Her bare shoulders make me desperate to touch her exposed skin. And kiss it. Her top is fitted below her breasts while the bottom flows loosely over her jeans. I picture them riding low on her hips so I have easy access to kiss her belly.\n She takes a guitar, which I strongly suspect is the instrument her sperm donor gave to her mother, and lifts its strap over her head. She should be holding her Martin instead of the one hanging on her shoulder right now.\n Her back is to the crowd and again I\u0027m reminded of that night in Wagga Wagga when I watched her do the exact thing. She mesmerized me beyond measure then and that hasn\u0027t changed. She still bewitches me.\n My American girl takes her place behind a mic and then I notice the guy next to her and how crazy all the chicks in the audience seem to be about him. I take notice of the other two band members. Jim didn\u0027t mention this—that she was part of an all-male band—and the little green monster residing within decides he wants to come out to kick arse and take names.\n When each of them is in place, an instrument in hand, the guy beside Laurelyn adjusts his mic. \"How\u0027s everyone in Dallas doing tonight?\"\n The crowd goes crazy with cheers and whistles as the drummer begins beating his largest drum to get the crowd on their feet. It sounds like everyone in the auditorium is clapping in unison with the pounding percussion. \"Anyone in this place ready to party?\" he shouts, and the noise explodes. These people love them.\n He picks out a sound on his guitar that I don\u0027t recognize and announces, \"Ladies always go first and our lovely Paige is gonna start us out with one from our new album called \u0027Let It Go.\u0027\"\n Her name is Laurelyn. Not Paige.\n My beautiful girl closes her eyes and I remember that as her signal—she\u0027s getting ready to sing. It\u0027s her way of shutting out the world and going to that place where she uses music and lyrics to tell her story.\n Music is what feelings sound like. Isn\u0027t that what she says?\n I\u0027m sitting on the edge of my seat. I confess I\u0027m a desperate man only holding on by a thin, thin thread. All I\u0027ve been able to hear in my head for months are the words I wish I\u0027d told her. But I\u0027m here with her now and this is my chance to prove to her how good we are together.\n She told me she loved me once and I pray that hasn\u0027t changed.\n She leans into her microphone as she sings of memories and goodbyes and I know her voice is the only one my heart recognizes. My core lures her sound into my chest and wraps it around the dead walls of my heart so it will have the desire to beat again.\n She opens her eyes when she starts the chorus. Like always. I don\u0027t like hearing her sing these lyrics about letting go. I know she chooses songs that speak from her heart and the thought of her singing those words with us in mind kills me. Maybe it means she\u0027s still thinking of me. Loving me. Holding out hope that I\u0027ll come for her.\n The crowd bursts into cheer and praise when she finishes her song, as they should. She\u0027s a fan-fucking-tastic performer. I already knew that but I don\u0027t think I realized the degree until this moment.\n The other singer steps up to his mic. \"That girl can tear it up, right?\"\n The crowd answers with louder yelling and clapping. \"This next one we\u0027re gonna do is called \u0027Win You Over.\u0027\" He looks at my girl and smiles as he gives her a wink. What the fuck is that about? The guy is looking at Laurelyn as he sings about winning a girl\u0027s heart after it\u0027s been broken. He\u0027s watching her eyes as he sings and that\u0027s when it strikes me—the motherfucker isn\u0027t singing for the crowd. He\u0027s singing to my girl.\n Son of a bitch!\n Don\u0027t look at him, Laurelyn. Don\u0027t fall for that shit—his seductive grin, his smooth voice, his deep dimples. I know those moves and it\u0027s all bullshit so he can fuck you.\n I\u0027m grasping the armrests of my seat so hard, I think I might crush them. What if I\u0027m too late and she\u0027s already with this jerkoff? It\u0027s a real possibility. She wouldn\u0027t have a reason not to be. She has no idea how much I love her or the lengths I\u0027ve gone to to find her. I\u0027m certain she thinks I\u0027ve moved on to my next companion. Why wouldn\u0027t she?\n And then I think of the woman I almost made number fourteen. She gladly went up to a hotel room with me, a complete stranger, only minutes after meeting. She was going to let me fuck her because the man she loved didn\u0027t return her affections. She wanted him out of her head that badly, if only for as long as it took to get off. That\u0027s who I could be to Laurelyn—the man she needs out of her head so badly, she\u0027d let this guy fuck her to erase me.\n This is bad. Very bad.\n I consider leaving my seat and walking toward the stage so she might see me and know I\u0027ve come for her. I want to see her reaction. I need to look into her eyes so I\u0027ll know if I\u0027m still the one she loves. Or if it\u0027s him now.\n I get up but my feet are frozen in place. They won\u0027t obey the commands being sent by my brain. They\u0027re smarter than my head or my heart. As much as I want her to know I\u0027m here, I can\u0027t because I\u0027m certain security would stop me from moving closer to the stage.\n The eye-fucker finishes his song and Laurelyn trades her guitar for another instrument—maybe a mandolin. She never told me she played anything but the piano and guitar, so I\u0027m suddenly jealous that these blokes know something about her that I don\u0027t.\n They begin the next song, a duet called \"Tell Me What I Want to Hear.\" Great. That\u0027s exactly what I want to watch—the two of them sing together. There\u0027s nothing I can do about it, so I might as well take a seat and calm the fuck down.\n They go through the rest of their set and I watch this bloke eye-fuck Laurelyn for almost two hours. It\u0027s brutal to see it happening when I can do nothing about it. I\u0027m mad as hell, but do I really have the right to say anything? I don\u0027t know, but I damn sure plan to find out.\n When it\u0027s time for the last song of the night, Laurelyn takes the stage front and center—as she should\u0027ve done all night—and I recognize the song coming from her bandmate\u0027s keyboard.\n \"This song is one I wrote when my best friend and I traveled out of the country several months back. I found myself with a lot of time on my hands and took the opportunity to do a little songwriting. I began writing it while we were there, but I couldn\u0027t quite make myself finish until about a month ago. It\u0027s called \u0027Without a Goodbye.\u0027\"\n I\u0027m waiting for your heart to wake\n So you will ask me to stay.\n My heart is impatiently waiting around\n To hear the words it\u0027s begging you to say.\n But if I remain and the words never come,\n It\u0027s a pain I don\u0027t think I can take.\n So I should go now without a goodbye\n And you\u0027ll never have to see these tears I cry.\n I should go now without a goodbye\n And I won\u0027t have to hide the pain in my eyes.\n I made the decision to walk away\n And now there\u0027s so much distance between you and me.\n Now you\u0027re so far away, so very far away.\n Will you always remain out of my reach?\n It\u0027s easy to lie myself but\n I fear my stupid heart will never be free.\n So I left without a goodbye\n And you\u0027ll never have to see these tears I cry.\n I left without a goodbye\n And I won\u0027t have to hide the pain in my eyes.\n Now it\u0027s been so long since I touched your face\n I can\u0027t stop thinking of those days.\n I\u0027m looking back at your photos\n And wondering if it\u0027s wrong for me to say.\n I\u0027m here all alone and I feel weak.\n Maybe I made a mistake when I walked away.\n And I was wrong to leave without a goodbye\n Because now you\u0027ll never see I want to try.\n I was wrong to leave without a goodbye\n Because now you\u0027ll never see the love in my eyes.\n It\u0027s a beautiful song, but so sad. The lyrics describe us perfectly, and I know in my heart, she\u0027s singing about us—at least I hope she is since the words describe making a mistake by leaving without a goodbye. It has to be us. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-10.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
