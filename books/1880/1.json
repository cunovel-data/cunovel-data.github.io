{"id":83718,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Chapter One\n Laurelyn Prescott\n Thank God for Valium.\n I feel guilty for taking a mind-altering drug so I can deal with the feelings I\u0027m having about leaving Jack Henry—especially after everything I went through with my mom\u0027s addiction. But I need an escape from the torment in my head. It\u0027s a temporary fix—I knew that when I took it—and I have no idea how I\u0027ll cope with my feelings once I\u0027m home without the effects of the medication to help me.\n It kills me to admit it, but I think I might understand how my mom\u0027s addiction started. I see how the path might be an easy one to follow when all you can see is darkness. This is a huge red flag for me. I\u0027ll love Jack Henry until I draw my last breath, but I won\u0027t allow myself to walk the same path as my mother—no matter how tempting.\n Our grueling flight from Sydney lands at LAX and I immediately notice the distinct smell of Los Angeles—fuel and smog—when our jet bridge attaches. It\u0027s the same odor that caught my attention when we connected here with our flight to Australia three months earlier. Wow. That was such a different time in my life.\n We fight our way out of the crowded terminal and find Addison\u0027s parents waiting for us at baggage claim. She\u0027s going home for two weeks to spend time with them before she comes back to Nashville. This means I\u0027ll be alone in our apartment for the next fourteen days. I\u0027m not so sure that\u0027s a good thing.\n The Donavons welcome their daughter with open arms—and me too. They love me like a daughter and I think about how perfect it could\u0027ve been if I\u0027d fallen in love with their son instead of a man who never wants to see me again. My relationship with Ben could\u0027ve gone much differently. Who knows what might have happened between us had I not stumbled upon Jack Henry McLachlan in that bathroom hallway? But I did, and it isn\u0027t possible for me to be sorry about it. To regret meeting the man I love would be to wish him away, and I can never do that. The excruciating pain I feel in my heart is worth even the briefest time we had together.\n Addison looks at me like we\u0027ll never see one another again. \"I really wish you\u0027d come with me. I hate to see you go home like this.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be fine, Addie.\" She has no idea how experienced I am with finding ways to cope when life has treated me a little too cruelly. \"My mom would be really disappointed if I didn\u0027t come home today.\"\n \"Yeah…but promise me you won\u0027t spend the next two weeks sitting in the apartment thinking about him.\"\n \"I promise I\u0027m not going to do that,\" I lie. I fake a smile to reassure her. \"I\u0027m jumping head first into my music as soon as I\u0027m back. It\u0027ll be a good distraction.\"\n \"You know I don\u0027t believe you.\" She\u0027s wearing that look I hate so much. Pity. Grrr.\n \"I\u0027m not breakable, Addie. I\u0027m a tough cookie. Yes, I\u0027m sad about leaving him but I\u0027ll get over it. It\u0027s not the end of the world.\" Lie. Lie. Lie. There\u0027s something wrong with me. I can\u0027t even tell my best friend how shattered I am. Why am I not able to let anyone in? Except Jack Henry…he\u0027s the only one in this world who has broken through, who knows the real me.\n \"We\u0027ll talk every day while I\u0027m gone.\" She squeezes me tightly as we say goodbye and whispers in my ear, \"I\u0027ll need to know you\u0027re okay.\"\n I hate the way she makes me sound—like I\u0027m self-destructive. It pisses me off. \"Shit, Addie! My life isn\u0027t over because I\u0027m not with him. Yes, I\u0027m going to miss Lachlan.\" I wish I didn\u0027t have to call him that with her. \"Missing him is okay—it\u0027s normal—but it doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m gonna lie down and die.\" The words sound really good coming out of my mouth. I wish they were true.\n She\u0027s smiling. I think that means she\u0027s pleased by my feisty retort but she doesn\u0027t realize she\u0027s poking an unstable beast with her invisible stick. \"Good. That\u0027s exactly what I needed to hear from you.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be okay.\"\n \"I just needed to know post-Lachlan Laurelyn isn\u0027t going to be like post-Blake Laurelyn.\"\n Psst. Post-Blake Laurelyn has nothing on post-Jack Henry Laurelyn but I can\u0027t let her know that so I\u0027ll have to get my shit together before she comes back to Nashville. \"No worries, Addie.\"\n \"I feel marginally better about letting you go home alone now, but I meant what I said about talking every day.\"\n She looks relieved. Did she really buy what I\u0027m selling? Damn, I\u0027m better at this than I thought.\n When we part ways, I\u0027m left by myself. Again. Like always.\n While waiting in the terminal, I decide to check in. \"Hey, Mom.\"\n \"Hey, baby girl.\" Something about those words always puts me at ease.\n \"I just wanted to let you know we made it fine. I\u0027ll be boarding for Nashville in about an hour, so I\u0027ll need you to pick me up around one.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be there. I can\u0027t wait to see you and hear everything about your trip.\" Dammit! Am I going to admit that I went to Australia and fell in love with a man I\u0027ll never see again?\n \"I can\u0027t wait to see you, either.\" I don\u0027t think I have a choice. Every moment of my three months in Australia practically revolved around Jack Henry. I won\u0027t have much to share if I don\u0027t tell her about us. \"We have a lot to talk about, Mom.\"\n \"I have things to tell you too.\" Uh-oh. That statement could only precede what my mom thinks of as good news. I really don\u0027t need more shit at this point in my life and I\u0027m positive I don\u0027t want to hear about whatever it is before I board this flight. \"Okay. You can surprise me after I\u0027m home.\"\n \"Sounds like a plan.\"\n I end the call and my mind immediately spins with all the things she might tell me. She sounded really happy. It\u0027s gonna be something about him. I know it is, without a doubt. She was too giddy for it to be anything else.\n For the first time in my life, I\u0027m not pissed off at her for being so in love with him. I understand it now—how she can still be so consumed by him after all these years. Is that what I can expect the rest of my life to be like? I\u0027ll never forget the love I have for Jack Henry. Never.\n My mom has been forced to look at me—the child she shares with the man she loves—almost every day for twenty-three years. I make it impossible for her to forget him, especially since I\u0027m his mini-me all the way down to his brown hair and light brown eyes. Not an ounce of my mom\u0027s blond and green.\n Maybe living without Jack Henry won\u0027t be as bad for me since I won\u0027t have his child as a daily reminder of what we once had. The thought reminds me of what he told me the first time we talked about birth control. I don\u0027t want you leaving here with my ankle-biter in your belly. That night feels like a million years ago.\n He doesn\u0027t think so now—because he\u0027s trying to be selfless—but one day he\u0027ll marry another woman and give her his children. Margaret will see to it. I\u0027m certain of it. And the thought breaks my heart because I want to be the one to have his babies.\n Oh, shit—my birth control pills. I remember taking them out of the nightstand drawer. Did I leave them on the bed? I was so distracted throwing things into suitcases before Jack Henry could come home for a lunchtime romp. Stupid, you told yourself to not forget them and you did anyway.\n There\u0027s nothing I can do about it now. I\u0027ll run by the pharmacy as soon as I get home. I\u0027ll be two days behind by the time I\u0027m able to get my hands on another pack. Taking more than one at a time is gonna make me feel blah—that extra dose of hormones always does that to me—but it should at least keep me from being pregnant. Maybe.\n I look at my phone in my hand and I can\u0027t help myself—I have to see his face now that I don\u0027t have Addison interpreting my every move. I look at the first picture I ever took of Jack Henry. It\u0027s the one where he\u0027s driving us to Avalon, the top down on the convertible after we went into town for condom shopping. I giggle aloud as I remember my shock at seeing how many he bought. I look around the terminal to see if anyone is looking at me like I\u0027m crazy. I don\u0027t care—maybe I am a little on the mental side. If I\u0027m not today, I have a feeling I will be before much longer.\n I disembark in Nashville and see the top of my mom\u0027s blond head in the distance. She\u0027s tall so she\u0027s easy to spot and I\u0027m relieved to see she\u0027s alone. I almost expected her to have him with her, although deep down, I knew it was an unrealistic possibility.\n She wraps me in her arms and I realize I need her in a way I never have before. I long to tell her everything about Jack Henry. I want her to reassure me that it\u0027s all going to be okay. Even if it\u0027s a lie, I\u0027m desperate for her to tell me I\u0027ll go on and one day be fine without him.\n \"Mmm,\" she groans as she squeezes tightly. \"I\u0027m happy to have my girl back.\"\n \"I missed you, Mom. It\u0027s good to be home.\"\n She steps back but holds on to my hands, stretching my arms to study me. \"You look different, Laurie.\"\n She has no idea how different I am from the girl she saw three months ago. \"I\u0027m tanned.\"\n \"Yes, you got a lot of color, but that\u0027s not it.\"\n I don\u0027t know what she thinks is physically different about me. It\u0027s not possible for her to see the pain in my heart. \"You\u0027re right. There\u0027s a lot that\u0027s different about me now.\"\n \"And I can\u0027t wait to hear all about it. How about a late lunch? You can tell me everything.\"\n \"Sure. Sounds great.\"\n She takes me to my favorite Mexican restaurant and my mouth begins to water when I smell the spicy aroma coming from the kitchen. It\u0027s a hole in the wall but the food is authentic. I\u0027ve missed it. Since it\u0027s midafternoon, they\u0027re not busy and we take our usual booth in the corner. \"Laurie, I have some wonderful news.\"\n I guess that means she\u0027s going first and what I have to say about Australia and Jack Henry will wait until she\u0027s finished. \"Okay. I\u0027m listening.\"\n \"It\u0027s about me and your dad.\" She looks ecstatic so I\u0027m guessing he\u0027s given her some sort of attention or sign of affection. If that\u0027s what this is about, she\u0027s pathetic. And I\u0027m following right in her footsteps. \"You know he came to see me while you were in Australia…\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-1.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
