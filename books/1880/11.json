Before I get up, I take out the single long-stem red rose I tucked away inside the Martin\u0027s case.\n With her guitar in one hand and the rose in the other, I begin the walk that will end my long search to find my beloved. I\u0027m wound tighter than a spring—partly because I\u0027ve watched Don-fucking-Juan make moves on my girl all night—but more so because I\u0027m finally about to see the woman I love with all my heart.\n Once I make my way down to where the stage leads toward the back, a security guard stops me. \"No one is allowed back there except the band and the staff.\"\n \"I have Paige\u0027s extra guitar.\" I hold up the evidence in my hand.\n He crosses his arms and puffs his chest. \"Sorry. If that belongs to one of the musicians, then you should make other arrangements to get it to her.\"\n I can see that muscle man won\u0027t be sweet-talked, so I pull out my wallet to begin our discussion in a manner that may persuade him. I take ten hundred-dollar bills and hold them in front of his face. \"One thousand dollars cash. It\u0027s yours if you let me back so I can give Miss McLachlan her guitar.\"\n His eyes grow large and he looks around. He reaches for and swipes the cash from my hand. \"If you get caught, don\u0027t you fucking tell them it was me that let you back. Got it?\"\n Bingo! \"Absolutely not.\"\n He swings a door open and points down a hall. \"She should be in the lounge while they\u0027re packing up the stage. Third room on the left.\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n He shuts the door behind me. I stand in the corridor for a moment and take a deep breath. My heart slams against my chest, trying to escape to find its mate. It\u0027s drawing me to her because my heart requires her to feel complete again.\n I make my way down the hall. I pass a couple of blokes along the way but they see the guitar case in my hand and say nothing. I stop at the door and hesitate because I\u0027m scared shitless.\n The door is cracked and I see Laurelyn sitting on a couch—with the eye-fucker beside her. His hand is on her leg and he\u0027s rubbing it slowly—just the way I did so many times. Fuck! He\u0027s touching her but even worse, she\u0027s letting him. And it\u0027s breaking my heart. I\u0027m sure I feel it shattering into a million pieces as I stand here witnessing the one thing I was so afraid of.\n I squeeze my eyes shut, hoping I\u0027m seeing this wrong or that my mind is playing tricks on me. When I open my eyes again, he\u0027s leaning over. To kiss her.\n I turn away. Sickened. Devastated. Heartbroken.\n \"Hey. What are you doing back here? Who are you?\" I hear someone call out and I turn to see the band\u0027s drummer.\n I swallow the tortured sounds threatening to escape from my throat. This is my fault. I fucked up and now I\u0027m paying for it.\n I hold up the guitar case for him to see. \"This belongs to Miss McLachlan. Could you please give it to her? And the rose too.\"\n \"A Martin. Cool.\" He takes both from me and asks, \"Do I need to tell her anything?\"\n Yes. Tell her how much I love her and that I\u0027m so sorry for letting her go. \"Just tell her I enjoyed the show and that I said she was fan-fucking-tastic.\"\n He holds up the case and the rose. \"Who should I say these are from?\"\n \"She\u0027ll know who.\"\n Chapter Seven\n Charlie gives me that look most of the time we\u0027re performing, and I\u0027m pretty sure I don\u0027t need anyone to translate its meaning. It reminds me of what I once saw in Jack Henry\u0027s eyes—a forewarning of things to come.\n I still recall the way he could make me tremble when I saw that look from him. I desired all the things my sexy Aussie man had in store for me. And I still do. Desperately.\n I\u0027m not being fair to Charlie. He doesn\u0027t deserve what I\u0027ve put him through the last couple of months. He\u0027s a sweet guy and is so good to me. He\u0027s been incredibly kind and understanding about Jack Henry. He even said that he\u0027s willing to wait for me, but tonight\u0027s there\u0027s something different in his eyes. It\u0027s a fire and it\u0027s new. I consider it a warning that he may be changing his mind about patiently waiting for me to get over a man I\u0027ll never see again. Or never stop loving.\n We wrap up the show and the band heads backstage to the lounge. I\u0027m exhausted as I fall onto the couch. I just want to go back to the hotel, shower, and crawl into bed so I can sleep for a year—or until this ache in my heart has left me. But I can\u0027t. Charlie wants to talk and there\u0027s no way I\u0027m letting that conversation happen in either of our hotel rooms.\n He sits next to me on the couch and I find myself alone with him. He reaches for my hand and cups it inside his while his thumb strokes the top of mine. \"I want to talk about what\u0027s going on between us.\"\n He\u0027s right. We have to talk about whatever this is. I need to tell him we aren\u0027t going to happen, so it\u0027s only right for him to know before he has a chance to say too much. \"Okay, but I need to go first.\"\n Charlie\u0027s hand releases mine and he moves it to my knee. He begins rubbing it the way Jack Henry would when we\u0027d sit on the couch and talk. I catch myself closing my eyes so I can pretend it\u0027s my caveman\u0027s hand I feel—not Charlie\u0027s. \"I already know what you\u0027re going to say and that\u0027s why I\u0027m going first. I need to tell you how I feel before you have the opportunity to shoot me down.\"\n That confirms it. He\u0027s about to make his move.\n \"I know you aren\u0027t over him. I\u0027m not stupid. But I really believe I can make you forget him if you\u0027ll only let me try.\" He moves his hand higher up my thigh and twists his body so he\u0027s facing me. \"Would it be so hard to let me in? Would it be so terrible if you let go of all your pain and found happiness with me?\"\n It\u0027s what I want—to be happy again—and sleep a whole night without seeing him in my dreams. In my sleeping fantasies, he\u0027s cradling my face with his hands and asking me if I want to try to make things work. Then I wake and my heart breaks all over again. It\u0027s a vicious cycle and as hard as I try, I can\u0027t make it stop.\n I don\u0027t say anything—because I can\u0027t—and Charlie doesn\u0027t stop pleading his case. \"Those who can\u0027t forget the past are condemned to relive it. That\u0027s what\u0027s happening to you, and it has to stop. You have to let him go. It\u0027s been three months. He\u0027s in Australia and you\u0027re here. The bastard hasn\u0027t even made an attempt to call you.\" He reaches for my face and his thumb catches the single tear rolling down my cheek. \"I want to be the calm in your storm, not the shipwreck that takes you down. That\u0027s what he is to you.\"\n He reaches for my face and leans over to kiss me. I let him because I\u0027m desperate to feel anything besides this pain that consumes me night and day. It\u0027s smothering me and I die a little more each day.\n Charlie\u0027s lips are soft and his kiss is gentle. There\u0027s nothing demanding about it. Or stimulating. And it\u0027s at this moment that I\u0027m swallowed up by the fear that I may never find a man who makes me feel the way Jack Henry did.\n The lounge door swings open and PJ breezes into the room. I jerk away, embarrassed at being caught kissing Charlie. He stops and looks surprised. \"Sorry. Maybe I should\u0027ve knocked but I had no idea you two were going to be lip-locked.\"\n \"No problem. We all share this lounge. You don\u0027t have to knock.\" I don\u0027t know what else to say.\n He holds out a red rose for me. \"You have an admirer.\"\n I take the rose and bring it to my nose. Being given a bouquet of flowers isn\u0027t unusual after a show but I\u0027ve never been given a single rose before. It seems so intimate. \"A fan, I suppose?\"\n \"I found this dude standing outside the door looking in here just now. I asked him who he was but he didn\u0027t say. He just told me to give you the rose and this guitar. Oh, and tell you he enjoyed the show—that you were \u0027fan-fucking-tastic.\u0027\" He puts the case at my feet and the world around me begins to spin way too fast.\n It\u0027s my Martin. That can only mean Jack Henry was here. Right outside that door—that cracked door—while Charlie was kissing me.\n I dash off the couch and run down the hallway, calling out for him like a maniac. \"Jack Henry! Jack Henry!\"\n I have no idea which way to go, but I run toward the auditorium. It\u0027s empty other than the cleaning staff, so I run toward the lobby and out to the street where I pray I\u0027ll find him standing on the sidewalk.\n It\u0027s storming and the raindrops pelting down sting as they hit my face. I reach up to push my wet hair from my eyes and that\u0027s when I see him. He\u0027s getting into a cab up the street. \"Jack Henry!\" I shout at the top of my lungs but he doesn\u0027t hear me. He\u0027s too far away. \"Jack Henry!\"\n I run toward the car screaming his name and I reach the cab as it\u0027s leaving. I slam my hand across the top of the trunk as hard as I can before watching it pull away, taking him out of my life again.\n \"Nooo!\" I scream so loudly, my vocal cords spasm. I drop to my knees there on the cold, wet concrete. I try to scream, and again, nothing comes out because my breath has been taken from me.\n Please, don\u0027t leave. Please, don\u0027t be gone out of my life forever.\n The cab moves for a moment but then I see the blurry, glowing red lights through the downpour against my face and heavy lens of tears covering my eyes. The cab\u0027s brake lights. The car has stopped, as have I—and then I see the back door open.\n It\u0027s my Jack Henry.\n He gets out of the cab and stands in the heavy rain looking back at me. I don\u0027t know how—because my body has turned to mush—but I\u0027m off my knees and running toward him. I pummel him against the open door when I reach him and squeeze my arms around him tightly, using all the strength I can muster. My knees are far too weak to stand in his arms without falling. I bury my face against his neck and breathe him in. This is where I want to be forever—in Jack Henry\u0027s arms.\n \"Are you in or out, man?\" I hear the driver call from inside the cab.\n Jack Henry doesn\u0027t answer and I ease my tight grip on him so I can look into his eyes. I touch his face because I can\u0027t believe he\u0027s real. \"You sort of have a beard. Almost. I love it. It\u0027s sexy.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-11.html","bookId":1880,"book":{"id":1880,"title":"Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Beauty from Surrender (Beauty #2) \n How do you move on when he’s every song you sing? \n After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left.
