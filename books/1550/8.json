{"id":107595,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u0027Quiet night?\u0027 M had got his pipe going. His hard, healthy eyes regarded Bond attentively. \u0027Pretty quiet, sir. Station H-\u0027 M raised his left hand an inch or two. \u0027Never mind. I\u0027ll read all about it in the log. Here, I\u0027ll take it.\u0027 Bond handed over the Top Secret folder. M put it to one side. He smiled one of his rare, rather sardonic, bitten-off smiles. \u0027Things change, 007. I\u0027m taking you off night duty for the present.\u0027 Bond\u0027s answering smile was taut. He felt the quickening of the pulse he had so often experienced in this room. M had got something for him. He said, \u0027I was just getting into it, sir.\u0027 \u0027Quite. Have plenty of opportunity later on. Something\u0027s come up. Odd business. Not really your line of country, except for one particular angle which\u0027 - M jerked his pipe sideways in a throwaway gesture - \u0027may not be an angle at all.\u0027 Bond sat back. He said nothing, waiting. \u0027Had dinner with the Governor of the Bank last night. One\u0027s always hearing something new. At \u0027least, all this was new to me. Gold - the seamy side of the stuff. Smuggling, counterfeiting, all that. Hadn\u0027t occurred to me that the Bank of England knew so much about crooks. Suppose it\u0027s part of the Bank\u0027s job to protect our currency.\u0027 M jerked his eyebrows up. \u0027Know anything about gold?\u0027 \u0027No, sir.\u0027 \u0027Well, you will by this afternoon. You\u0027ve got an appointment with a man called Colonel Smithers at the Bank at four o\u0027clock. That give you enough time to get some sleep?\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 \u0027Good. Seems that this man Smithers is head of the Bank\u0027s research department. From what the Governor told me, that\u0027s nothing more or less than a spy system. First time I knew they had one. Just shows what watertight compartments we all work in. Anyway, Smithers and his chaps keep an eye out for anything fishy in the banking world - particularly any monkeying about with our currency and bullion reserves and what not. There was that business the other day of the Italians who were counterfeiting sovereigns. Making them out of real gold. Right carats and all that. But apparently a sovereign or a French napoleon is worth much more than its melted-down value in gold. Don\u0027t ask me why. Smithers can tell you that if you\u0027re interested. Anyway, the Bank went after these people with a whole battery of lawyers-it wasn\u0027t technically a criminal offence - and, after losing in the Italian courts, they finally nailed them in Switzerland. You probably read about it. Then there was that business of dollar balances in Beirut. Made quite a stir in the papers. Couldn\u0027t understand it myself. Some crack in the fence we put round our currency. The wide City boys had found it. Well, it\u0027s Smithers\u0027s job to smell out that kind of racket. The reason the Governor told me all this is because for years, almost since the war apparently, Smithers has had a bee in his bonnet about some big gold leak out of England. Mostly deduction, plus some kind of instinct. Smithers admits he\u0027s got damned little to go on, but he\u0027s impressed the Governor enough for him to get permission from the PM to call us in.\u0027 M broke off. He looked quizzically at Bond. \u0027Ever wondered who are the richest men in England?\u0027 â€¢No, sir.\u0027 \"Well, have a guess. Or rather, put it like this: Who are the richest Englishmen?\u0027 Bond searched his mind. There were a lot of men who sounded rich or who were made to sound rich by the newspapers. But who really had it, liquid, in the bank? He had to say something. He said hesitatingly, \u0027Well, sir, there\u0027s Sas-soon. Then that shipping man who keeps to himself - er -Ellerman. They say Lord Cowdray is very rich. There are the bankers - Rothschilds, Barings, Hambros. There was Williamson, the diamond man. Oppenheimer in South Africa. Some of the dukes may still have a lot of money.\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice trailed away. \u0027Not bad. Not bad at all. But you\u0027ve missed out the joker in the pack. Man I\u0027d never thought of until the Governor brought up his name. He\u0027s the richest of the lot. Man called Goldfinger. Auric Goldfinger.\u0027 Bond couldn\u0027t help himself. He laughed sharply. \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 M\u0027s voice was testy. What the hell is there to laugh about?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry, sir.\u0027 Bond got hold of himself. \u0027The truth is, only last night I was building his face up on the Identicast.\u0027 He glanced at his watch. In a strangled voice he said, \u0027Be on its way to CID Records. Asked for a Trace on him.\u0027 M was getting angry. \u0027What the hell\u0027s all this about? Stop behaving like a bloody schoolboy.\u0027 Bond said soberly, \u0027Well, sir, it\u0027s like this...\u0027 Bond told the story, leaving nothing out. M\u0027s face cleared. He listened with all his attention, leaning forward across the desk. When Bond had finished, M sat back in his chair. He said \"Well, well... well\u0027 on a diminishing scale. He put his hands behind his head and gazed for minutes at the ceiling. Bond could feel the laughter coming on again. How would the CID word the resounding snub he would get in the course of the day? He was brought sharply back to earth by M\u0027s next words. \u0027By the way, what happened to that ten thousand dollars?\u0027 \u0027Gave it to the girl, sir.\u0027 \u0027Really! Why not to the White Cross?\u0027 The White Cross Fund was for the families of Secret Service men and women who were killed on duty. \u0027Sorry, sir.\u0027 Bond was not prepared to argue that one. \u0027Humpf.\u0027 M had never approved of Bond\u0027s womanizing. It was anathema to his Victorian soul. He decided to let it pass. He said, \u0027Well, that\u0027s all for now, 007. You\u0027ll be hearing all about it this afternoon. Funny about Goldfinger. Odd chap. Seen him once or twice at Blades. He plays bridge there when he\u0027s in England. He\u0027s the chap the Bank of England\u0027s after.\u0027 M paused. He looked mildly across the table at Bond. \u0027As from this moment, so are you.\u0027 CHAPTER SIX TALK OF GOLD BOND WALKED up the steps and through the fine bronze portals and into the spacious, softly echoing entrance hall of the Bank of England and looked around him. Under his feet glittered the brilliant golden patterns of the Boris Anrep mosaics; beyond, through twenty-feet-high arched windows, green grass and geraniums blazed in the central courtyard. To right and left were spacious vistas of polished Hopton Wood stone. Over all hung the neutral smell of air-conditioned air and the heavy, grave atmosphere of immense riches. One of the athletic-looking, pink frock-coated commissionaires came up to him. \u0027Yes, sir?\u0027 \u0027Colonel Smithers?\u0027 \u0027Commander Bond, sir? This way please.\u0027 The commissionaire moved off to the right between the pillars. The bronze doors of a discreetly hidden lift stood open. The lift rose a few feet to the first floor. Now there was a long panelled corridor ending in a tall Adam window. The floor was close-carpeted in beige Wilton. The commissionaire knocked at the last of several finely carved oak doors that were just so much taller and more elegant than ordinary doors. A grey-haired woman was sitting at a desk. She looked as if she had once taken a double first. The walls of the room were lined with grey metal filing cabinets. The woman had been writing on a quarto pad of yellow memorandum paper. She smiled with a hint of conspiracy, picked up a telephone and dialled a number. \u0027Commander Bond is here.\u0027 She put the telephone back and stood up. \u0027Will you come this way?\u0027 She crossed the room to a door covered with green baize and held it open for Bond to go through. Colonel Smithers had risen from his desk. He said gravely, \u0027Nice of you to have come. Won\u0027t you sit down?\u0027 Bond took the chair. \u0027Smoke?\u0027 Colonel Smithers pushed forward a silver box of Senior Service and himself sat down and began to fill a pipe. Bond took a cigarette and lit it. Colonel Smithers looked exactly like someone who would be called Colonel Smithers. He had obviously been a colonel, probably on the staff, and he had the smooth, polished, basically serious mien that fitted his name. But for his hornrimmed glasses, he might have been an efficient, not very well-fed courtier in a royal household. Bond felt boredom gathering in the corners of the room. He said encouragingly, \u0027It seems that you are to tell me all about gold.\" \u0027So I understand. I had a note from the Governor. I gather I need keep nothing from you. Of course you understand\u0027 -Colonel Smithers looked over Bond\u0027s right shoulder -\u0027that most of what I shall have to say will be confidential.\u0027 The eyes swept quickly across Bond\u0027s face. Bond\u0027s face was stony. Colonel Smithers felt the silence that Bond had intended he should feel. He looked up, saw that he had put his foot in it, and tried to make amends. \u0027Obviously I needn\u0027t have mentioned the point. A man with your training...\u0027 Bond said, \u0027We all think our own secrets are the only ones that matter. You\u0027re probably right to remind me. Other people\u0027s secrets are never quite as important as one\u0027s own. But you needn\u0027t worry. I shall discuss things with my chief but with no one else.\u0027 \u0027Quite, quite. Nice of you to take it that way. In the Bank one gets into the habit of being over-discreet. Now then,\u0027 Colonel Smithers scurried for cover into his subject. \u0027This business of gold. I take it it\u0027s not a matter you\u0027ve thought about a great deal?\u0027 \u0027I know it when I see it.\u0027 \u0027Aha, yes - well now, the great thing to remember about gold is that it\u0027s the most valuable and most easily marketable commodity in the world. You can go to any town in the world, almost to any village, and hand over a piece of gold and get goods or services in exchange. Right?\u0027 Colonel Smithers\u0027s voice had taken on a new briskness. His eyes were alight. He had his lecture pat. Bond sat back. He was prepared to listen to anyone who was master of his subject, any subject. \u0027And the next thing to remember,\u0027 Colonel Smithers held up his pipe in warning, \u0027is that gold is virtually untrace-able. Sovereigns have no serial numbers. If gold bars have Mint marks stamped on them the marks can be shaved off or the bar can be melted down and made into a new bar. That makes it almost impossible to check on the whereabouts of gold, or its origins, or its movements round the world. In England, for instance, we at the Bank can only count the gold in our own vaults,\u0027in the vaults of other banks and at the Mint, and make a rough guess at the amounts held by the jewellery trade and the pawnbroking fraternity.\u0027 \u0027Why are you so anxious to know how much gold there is in England?\u0027 \u0027Because gold and currencies backed by gold are the foundation of our international credit. We can only tell what the true strength of the pound is, and other countries can only tell it, by knowing the amount of valuta we have behind our currency. And my main job, Mr Bond\u0027 - Colonel Smithers\u0027s bland eyes had become unexpectedly sharp - \u0027is to watch for any leakage of gold out of England - out of anywhere in the sterling area. And when I spot a leakage, an escape of gold towards some country where it can be exchanged more profitably than at our official buying price, it is my job to put the CID Gold Squad on to the fugitive gold and try to get it back into our vaults, plug the leak and arrest the people responsible. And the trouble is, Mr Bond\u0027 -Colonel Smithers gave a forlorn shrug of the shoulders -\u0027that gold attracts the biggest, the most ingenious criminals. They are very hard, very hard indeed, to catch.\u0027 \u0027Isn\u0027t all this only a temporary phase? Why should this shortage of gold go on? They seem to be digging it out of Africa fast enough. Isn\u0027t there enough to go round? Isn\u0027t it just like any other black market that disappears when the supplies are stepped up, like the penicillin traffic after the war?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m afraid not, Mr Bond. It isn\u0027t quite as easy as that. The population of the world is increasing at the rate of five thousand four hundred every hour of the day. A small percentage of those people become gold hoarders, people who are frightened of currencies, who like to bury some sovereigns in the garden or under the bed. Another percentage needs gold fillings for their teeth. Others need gold-rimmed spectacles, jewellery, engagement rings. All these new people will be taking tons of gold off the market every year. New industries need gold wire, gold plating, amalgams of gold. Gold has extraordinary properties which are being put to new uses every day. It is brilliant, malleable, ductile, almost unalterable and more dense than any of the common metals except platinum. There\u0027s no end to its uses. But it has two defects. It isn\u0027t hard enough. It wears out quickly, leaves itself on the linings of our pockets and in the sweat of our skins. Every year, the world\u0027s stock is invisibly reduced by friction. I said that gold has two defects.\u0027 Colonel Smithers looked sad. \u0027The other and by far the major defect is that it is the talisman of fear. Fear, Mr Bond, takes gold out of circulation and hoards it against the evil day. In a period of history when every tomorrow may be the evil day, it is fair enough to say that a fat proportion of the gold that is dug out of one corner of the earth is at once buried again in another corner.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/goldfinger-james-bond-7/page-8.html","bookId":1550,"book":{"id":1550,"title":"Goldfinger (James Bond #7)","description":"Storyline: Goldfinger (James Bond (Original Series) #7) Auric Goldfinger, the most phenomenal criminal Bond has ever faced, is an evil genius who likes his cash in gold bars and his women dressed only in gold paint.
