{"id":107598,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"The traffic was thinning through the outskirts of Gilling-ham. Bond started motoring again, but easily now, not hurrying, following his thoughts as the hands and feet went through their automatic responses.\\n\\n So, in\u0027thirty-seven, SMERSH must have sent Goldfinger out With the belt of gold round his young waist. He had shown his special aptitudes, his acquisitive bent, during his training in the spy school in Leningrad. He would have been told there would be a war, that he must dig himself in and start quietly accumulating. Goldfinger must never dirty his hands, never meet an agent, never receive or pass a message. Some routine would have been arranged. \u0027Second-hand \u002739 Vauxhall. First offer of £1000 secures\u0027, \u0027Immaculate Rover, £2000\u0027, \u0027Bentley, £5000\u0027. Always an advertisement that would not attract attention or correspondence. The prices would be just too high, the description inadequate. In the Agony column of The Times, perhaps. And, obediently, Goldfinger would leave the two thousand pounds or the five thousand pounds gold bar at one of a long, a very long series of post-boxes that had been arranged in Moscow before he left. A particular bridge, a hollow tree, under a rock in a stream somewhere, anywhere in England. And he would never, on any account, visit that postbox again. It was up to Moscow to see that the agent got to the hidden treasure. Later, after the war, when Goldfinger was blossoming out, when he had become a big man, the postboxes would no longer be bridges and trees. Now he would be given dates and safety deposit box numbers, left-luggage lockers at stations. But still there would be the rule that Goldfinger must never revisit the scene, never endanger himself. Perhaps he would only get his instructions once a year, at a casual meeting in some park, in a letter slipped into his pocket on a train journey. But always it would be bars of gold, anonymous, untraceable if captured - except for the tiny Z that his vanity had scratched on his handiwork and that a dull dog at the Bank of England called Colonel Smithers had happened upon in the course of his duties.\\n\\n Now Bond was running through the endless orchards of the Faversham growers. The sun had come out from behind, the smog of London. There was the distant gleam of the Thames on his left. There was traffic on the river - long, glistening tankers, stubby merchantmen, antediluvian Dutch Schuyts. Bond left the Canterbury road and switched on to the incongruously rich highway that runs through the cheap bungaloid world of the holiday lands - Whitstable, Herne Bay, Birchington, Margate. He still idled along at fifty, holding the racing wheel on a light rein, listening to the relaxed purr of the exhausts, fitting the bits of his thoughts info the jigsaw as he had done two nights before with Goldfinger\u0027s face on the Identicast.\\n\\n And, Bond reflected, while Goldfinger was pumping a million, two million pounds a year into the bloody maw of SMERSH, he was pyramiding his reserves, working on them, making them work for him whenever the odds were right, piling up the surplus for the day when the trumpets would sound in the Kremlin and every golden sinew would be mobilized. And no one outside Moscow had been watching the process, no one suspected that Goldfinger - the jeweller, the metallurgist, the resident of Reculver and Nassau, the respected member of Blades, of the Royal St Marks at Sandwich - was one of the greatest conspirators of all time, that he had financed the murder of hundreds, perhaps thousands of victims of SMERSH all over the world. SMERSH, Smiert Spionam, Death to Spies - the murder Apparat of the High Praesidium! And only M suspected it, only Bond knew it. And here was Bond, launched against this man by a series of flukes, a train of coincidence that had been started by a plane breaking down on the other side of the world. Bond smiled grimly to himself. How often in his profession had it been the same - the tiny acorn of coincidence that soared into the mighty oak whose branches darkened the sky. And now, once again, he was setting out to bring the dreadful growth down. With what? A bag of golf clubs?\\n\\n A repainted sky-blue Ford Popular with large yellow ears was scurrying along the crown of the road ahead. Mechanically Bond gave the horn ring a couple of short, polite jabs. There was no reaction. The Ford Popular was doing its forty. Why should anyone want to go more than that respectable speed? The Ford obstinately hunched its shoulders and kept on its course. Bond gave it a sharp blast, expecting it to swerve. He had to touch his brakes when it didn\u0027t. Damn the man! Of course! The usual tense figure, hands held too high up on the wheel, and the inevitable hat, this time a particularly hideous black bowler, square on a large bullet head. Oh well, thought Bond, they weren\u0027t his stomach ulcers. He changed down and contemptuously slammed the DB III past on the inside. Silly bastard!\\n\\n Another five miles and Bond was through the dainty tele-world of Herne Bay. The howl of Mansion sounded away on his right. A flight of three Super Sabres came in to land. They skimmed below his right-Hand horizon as if they were diving into the earth. With half his mind, Bond heard the roar of their jets catch up with them as they landed and taxied in to the hangars. He came up with a crossroads. To the left the signpost said RECULVER. Underneath was the ancient monument sign for Reculver church. Bond slowed, but didn\u0027t stop. No hanging about. He motored slowly on, keeping his eyes open. The shoreline was too exposed for a trawler to do anything but beach or anchor. Probably Gold-finger had used Ramsgate. Quiet little port. Customs and police who were probably only on the look-out for brandy coming over from France. There was a thick clump of trees between the road and the shore, a glimpse of roofs and of a medium-sized factory chimney with a thin plume of light smoke or steam. That would be it. Soon there was the gate of a long drive. A discreetly authoritative sign said THANET ALLOYS, and underneath: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON BUSINESS. All very respectable. Bond drove slowly on. There was nothing more to be seen. He took the next right-hand turn across the Manston plateau to Ramsgate.\\n\\n It was twelve o\u0027clock. Bond inspected his room, a double with bathroom, on the top floor of the Channel Packet, unpacked his few belongings and went down to the snack bar where he had one vodka and tonic and two rounds of excellent ham sandwiches with plenty of mustard. Then he got back into his car and drove slowly over to the Royal St Marks at Sandwich.\\n\\n Bond carried his clubs to the professional\u0027s shop and through to the workroom. Alfred Blacking was winding a new grip on to a driver.\\n\\n \u0027Hullo, Alfred.\u0027\\n\\n The professional looked up sharply. His sunburned, leathery face broke into a wide smile. \u0027Why, if it isn\u0027t Mr James!\u0027 They shook hands. \u0027Must be fifteen, twenty years. What brings you down here, sir? Someone was telling me only the other day that you\u0027re in the diplomatic or something. Always abroad. Well, I never! Still the same flat swing, sir?\u0027 Alfred Blacking joined his hands and gave a low, flat sweep.\\n\\n \u0027Afraid so, Alfred. Never had time to get myself out of it. How\u0027s Mrs Blacking and Cecil?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t complain, sir. Cecil was runner-up in the Kent Championship last year. Should win it this year if he can only get out of the shop and on to the course a bit more.\u0027\\n\\n Bond propped his clubs up against the wall. It was good to be back. Everything was just the same. There had been a time in his teens when he had played two rounds a day every day of the week at St Marks. Blacking had always wanted to take him in hand. \u0027A bit of practice, Mr James, and you\u0027d be scratch. No fooling. You really would. What do you want to hang around at six for? It\u0027s all there except for that flat swing and wanting to hit the ball out of sight when there\u0027s no point in it. And you\u0027ve got the temperament. A couple of years, perhaps only one, and I\u0027d have you in the Amateur.\u0027 But something had told Bond that there wasn\u0027t going to be a great deal of golf in his life and if he liked the game he\u0027d better forget about lessons and just play as much of it as he could. Yes, it would be about twenty years since he had played his last round on St Marks. He\u0027d never been back -even when there had been that bloody affair of the Moon-raker at Kingsdown, ten miles down the coast. Perhaps it had been sentimentality. Since St Marks, Bond had got in a good deal of weekend golf when he was at headquarters. But always on the courses round London - Huntercombe, Swinley, Sunningdale, the Berkshire. Bond\u0027s handicap had gone up to nine. But he was a real nine - had to be with the games he chose to play, the ten-pound Nassaus with the tough cheery men who were always so anxious to stand you a couple of double kümmels after lunch.\\n\\n \u0027Any chance of a game, Alfred?\u0027\\n\\n The professional glanced through his back window at the parking space round the tall flag-pole. He shook his head. \u0027Doesn\u0027t look too good, sir. Don\u0027t get many players in the middle of the week at this time of year.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry, sir. I\u0027m booked. Playing with a member. It\u0027s a regular thing. Every day at two o\u0027clock. And the trouble is that Cecil\u0027s gone over to Princes to get in some practice for the championship. What a dashed nuisance!\u0027 (Alfred never used a stronger oath.) \u0027It would happen like that. How long are you staying, sir?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not long. Never mind. I\u0027ll knock a ball round with a caddie. Who\u0027s this chap you\u0027re playing with?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A Mr Goldfinger, sir.\u0027 Alfred looked discouraging.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Goldfinger. I know the chap. Met him the other day in America.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You did, sir?\u0027 Alfred obviously found it difficult to believe that anyone knew Mr Goldfinger. He watched Bond\u0027s face carefully for any further reaction.\\n\\n \u0027Any good?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So-so, sir. Pretty useful off nine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Must take his game damned seriously if he plays with you every day.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes, sir.\u0027 The professional\u0027s face had the expression Bond remembered so well. It meant that Blacking had an unfavourable view of a particular member but that he was too good a servant of the club to pass it on.\\n\\n Bond smiled. He said, \u0027You haven\u0027t changed, Alfred. What you mean is that no one else will play widi him. Remember Farquharson? Slowest player in England. I remember you going round and round with him twenty years ago. Come on. What\u0027s the matter with Goldfinger?\u0027\\n\\n The professional laughed. He said, \u0027It\u0027s you that hasn\u0027t changed, Mr James. You always were dashed inquisitive.\u0027 He came a step closer and lowered his voice. \u0027The truth is, sir, some members think Mr Goldfinger is just a little bit hot. You know, sir. Improves his lie and so forth.\u0027 The professional took the driver he was holding, took up a stance, gazed towards an imaginary hole and banged the head of the club up and down on the floor as if addressing an imaginary ball. \u0027Let me see now, is this a brassie lie? What d\u0027you think caddie?\u0027 Alfred Blacking chuckled. \"Well, of course, by the time he\u0027s finished hammering the ground behind the ball, the ball\u0027s been raised an inch and it is a brassie lie.\u0027 Alfred Blacking\u0027s face closed up again. He said non-committally, \u0027But that\u0027s only gossip, sir. I\u0027ve never seen anything. Quiet-spoken gentleman. He\u0027s got a place at Reculver. Used to come here a lot. But for the last few years he\u0027s only been coming to England for a few weeks at a time. Rings up and asks if anyone\u0027s wanting a game and when there isn\u0027t anyone he books Cecil or me. Rang up this morning and asked if there was anyone about. There\u0027s sometimes a stranger drops in.\u0027 Alfred Blacking looked quizzically at Bond. \u0027I suppose you wouldn\u0027t care to take him on this afternoon? It\u0027ll look odd you being here and short of a game. And you knowing him and all. He might think I\u0027d been trying to keep him to myself or something. That wouldn\u0027t do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nonsense, Alfred. And you\u0027ve got your living to make. Why don\u0027t we play a three-ball?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He won\u0027t play them, sir. Says they\u0027re too slow. And I agree with him. And don\u0027t you worry about my fee. There\u0027s a lot of work to do in the shop and 1\u0027U be glad of an afternoon to get down to it.\u0027 Alfred Blacking glanced at his watch. \u0027He\u0027ll be along any minute now. I\u0027ve got a caddie for you. Remember Hawker?\u0027 Alfred Blacking laughed indulgently. \u0027Still the same old Hawker. He\u0027ll be another that\u0027ll be glad to see you down here again.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/goldfinger-james-bond-7/page-11.html","bookId":1550,"book":{"id":1550,"title":"Goldfinger (James Bond #7)","description":"Storyline: Goldfinger (James Bond (Original Series) #7) \\n Auric Goldfinger, the most phenomenal criminal Bond has ever faced, is an evil genius who likes his cash in gold bars and his women dressed only in gold paint.
