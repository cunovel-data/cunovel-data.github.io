{"id":107589,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"The last light of the day had gone. Below the indigo sky the flare paths twinkled green and yellow and threw tiny reflections off the oily skin of the tarmac. With a shattering roar a DC 7 hurtled down the main green lane. The windows in the transit lounge rattled softly. People got up to watch. Bond tried to read their expressions. Did they hope the plane would crash - give them something to watch, something to talk about, something to fill their empty lives? Or did they wish it well? Which way were they willing the sixty passengers? To live or to die?\\n\\n Bond\u0027s lips turned down. Cut it out. Stop being so damned morbid. All this is just reaction from a dirty assignment. You\u0027re stale, tired of having to be tough. You want a change. You\u0027ve seen too much death. You want a slice of life - easy, soft, high.\\n\\n Bond was conscious of steps approaching. They stopped at his side. Bond looked up. It was a clean, rich-looking, middleaged man. His expression was embarrassed, deprecating.\\n\\n \u0027Pardon me, but surely it\u0027s Mr Bond... Mr - er - James Bond?\u0027\\n\\n CHAPTER TWO\\n\\n LIVING IT UP\\n\\n BOND LIKED anonymity. His \u0027Yes, it is\u0027 was discouraging.\\n\\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s a mighty rare coincidence.\u0027 The man held out his hand. Bond rose slowly, took the hand and released it. The hand was pulpy and unarticulated - like a hand-shaped mud pack, or an inflated rubber glove. \u0027My name is Du Pont. Junius Du Pont. I guess you won\u0027t remember me, but we\u0027ve met before. Mind if I sit down?\u0027\\n\\n The face, the name? Yes, there was something familiar. Long ago. Not in America. Bond searched the files while he summed the man up. Mr Du Pont was about fifty - pink, clean-shaven and dressed in the conventional disguise with which Brooks Brothers cover the shame of American millionaires. He wore a single-breasted dark tan tropical suit and a white silk shirt with a shallow collar. The rolled ends of the collar were joined by a gold safety pin beneath the knot of a narrow dark red and blue striped tie that fractionally wasn\u0027t the Brigade of Guards\u0027. The cuffs of the shirt protruded half an inch below the cuffs of the coat and showed cabochon crystal links containing miniature trout flies. The socks were charcoal-grey silk and the shoes were old and polished mahogany and hinted Peal. The man carried a dark, narrow-brimmed straw Homburg with a wide claret ribbon.\\n\\n Mr Du Pont sat down opposite Bond and produced cigarettes and a plain gold Zippo lighter. Bond noticed that he was sweating slightly. He decided that Mr Du Pont was what he appeared to be, a very rich American, mildly embarrassed. He knew he had seen him before, but he had no idea where or when.\\n\\n \u0027Smoke?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you.\u0027 It was a Parliament. Bond affected not to notice the offered lighter. He disliked held-out lighters. He picked up his own and lit the cigarette.\\n\\n Trance, \u002751, Royale les Eaux.\u0027 Mr Du Pont looked eagerly at Bond. \u0027That Casino. Ethel, that\u0027s Mrs Du Pont, and me were next to you at the table the night you had the big game with the Frenchman.\u0027\\n\\n Bond\u0027s memory raced back. Yes, of course. The Du Ponts had been Nos 4 and 5 at the baccarat table. Bond had been 6. They had seemed harmless people. He had been glad to have such a solid bulwark on his left .on that fantastic night when he had broken Le Chiffre. Now Bond saw it all again - the bright pool of light on the green baize, the pink crab hands across the table scuttling out for the cards. He smelled the smoke and the harsh tang of his own sweat. That had been a night! Bond looked across at Mr Du Pont and smiled at the memory. \u0027Yes, of course I remember. Sorry I was slow. But that was quite a night. I wasn\u0027t thinking of much except my cards.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Du Pont grinned back, happy and relieved. \u0027Why, gosh, Mr Bond. Of course I understand. And I do hope you\u0027ll pardon me for butting in. You see...\u0027 He snapped his ringers for a waitress. \u0027But we must have a drink to celebrate. What\u0027ll you have?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks. Bourbon on the rocks.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And dimple Haig and water.\u0027 The waitress went away.\\n\\n Mr Du Pont leant forward, beaming. A whiff of soap or after-shave lotion came across the table. Lentheric? \u0027I knew it was you. As soon as I saw you sitting there. But I thought to myself, Junius, you don\u0027t often make an error over a face, but let\u0027s just go make sure. Well, I was flying Transamerican tonight and, when they announced the delay, I watched your expression and, if you\u0027ll pardon me, Mr Bond, it was pretty clear from the look on your face that you had been flying Transamerican too.\u0027 He waited for Bond to nod. He hurried on. \u0027So I ran down to the ticket counter and had me a look at the passenger list. Sure enough, there it was, “J. Bond”.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Du Pont sat back, pleased with his cleverness. The drinks came. He raised his glass. \u0027Your very good health, sir. This sure is my lucky day.\u0027\\n\\n Bond smiled non-committally and drank.\\n\\n Mr Du Pont leant forward again. He looked round. There was nobody at the nearby tables. Nevertheless he lowered his voice. \u0027I guess you\u0027ll be saying to yourself, well, it\u0027s nice to see Junius Du Pont again, but what\u0027s the score? Why\u0027s he so particularly happy at seeing me on just this night?\u0027 Mr. Du Pont raised his eyebrows as if acting Bond\u0027s part for him. Bond put on a face of polite inquiry. Mr Du Pont leant still farther across the table. \u0027Now, I hope you\u0027ll forgive me, Mr Bond. It\u0027s not like me to pry into other people\u0027s secre... er - affairs. But, after that game at Royale, I did hear that you were not only a grand card player, but also that you were - er - how shall I put it? - that you were a sort of - er - investigator. You know, kind of intelligence operative.\u0027 Mr Du Font\u0027s indiscretion had made him go very red in the face. He sat back and took out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead. He looked anxiously at Bond.\\n\\n Bond shrugged his shoulders. The grey-blue eyes that looked into Mr Du Font\u0027s eyes, which had turned hard and watchful despite his embarrassment, held a mixture of candour, irony and self-deprecation. \u0027I used to dabble in that kind of thing. Hangover from the.war. One still thought it was fun playing Red Indians. But there\u0027s no future in it in peacetime.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Quite, quite.\u0027 Mr Du Pont made a throwaway gesture with the hand that held the cigarette. His eyes evaded Bond\u0027s as he put the next question, waited for the next lie. (Bond thought, there\u0027s a wolf in this Brooks Brothers clothing. This is a shrewd man.) \u0027And now you\u0027ve settled down?\u0027 Mr Du Pont smiled paternally. \u0027What did you choose, if you\u0027ll pardon the question?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Import and Export. I\u0027m with Universal. Perhaps you\u0027ve come across them.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Du Pont continued to play the game. \u0027Hm. Universal. Let me see. Why, yes, sure I\u0027ve heard of them. Can\u0027t say I\u0027ve ever done business with them, but I guess it\u0027s never too late.\u0027 He chuckled fatly. \u0027I\u0027ve got quite a heap of interests all over the place. Only stuff I can honestly say I\u0027m not interested in is chemicals. Maybe it\u0027s my misfortune, Mr Bond, but I\u0027m not one of the chemical Du Fonts.\u0027\\n\\n Bond decided that the man was quite satisfied with the particular brand of Du Pont he happened to be. He made no comment. He glanced at his watch to hurry Mr Du Font\u0027s play of the hand. He made a note to handle his own cards carefully. Mr Du Pont had a nice pink kindly baby-face with a puckered, rather feminine turn-down mouth. He looked as harmless as any of the middle-aged Americans with cameras who stand outside Buckingham Palace. But Bond sensed many tough, sharp qualities behind the fuddyduddy facade.\\n\\n Mr Du Font\u0027s sensitive eye caught Bond\u0027s glance at his watch. He consulted his own. \u0027My, oh my! Seven o\u0027clock and here I\u0027ve been talking away without coming to the point. Now, see here, Mr Bond. I\u0027ve got me a problem on which I\u0027d greatly appreciate your guidance. If you can spare me the time and if you were counting on stopping over in Miami tonight I\u0027d reckon it a real favour if you\u0027d allow me to be your host.\u0027 Mr Du Pont held up his hand. \u0027Now, I think I can promise to make you comfortable. So happens I own a piece of the Floridiana. Maybe you heard we opened around Christmas time? Doing a great business I\u0027m happy to say. Really pushing that little old Fountain Blue,\u0027 Mr Du Pont laughed indulgently. \u0027That\u0027s what we call the Fontainebleau down here. Now, what do you say, Mr Bond? You shall have the best suite - even if it. means putting some good paying customers out on the sidewalk. And you\u0027d be doing me a real favour.\u0027 Mr Du Pont looked imploring.\\n\\n Bond had already decided to accept - blind. Whatever Mr Du Font\u0027s problem - blackmail, gangsters, women - it would be some typical form of rich man\u0027s worry. Here was a slice of the easy life he had been asking for. Take it. Bond started to say something politely deprecating. Mr Du Pont interrupted. \u0027Please, please, Mr Bond. And believe me, I\u0027m grateful, very grateful indeed.\u0027 He snapped his fingers for the waitress. When she came, he turned away from Bond and settled the bill out of Bond\u0027s sight. Like many very rich men he considered that showing his money, letting someone see how much he tipped, amounted to indecent exposure. He thrust his roll back into his trousers pocket (the hip pocket is not the place among the rich) and took Bond by the arm. He sensed Bond\u0027s resistance to the contact and removed his hand. They went down the stairs to the main hall.\\n\\n \u0027Now, let\u0027s just straighten out your reservation.\u0027 Mr Du Pont headed for the Transamerica ticket counter. In a few curt phrases Mr Du Pont showed his power and efficiency in his own, his American, realm.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Mr Du Pont. Surely, Mr Du Pont. I\u0027ll take care of that, Mr Du Pont.\u0027\\n\\n Outside, a gleaming Chrysler Imperial sighed up to the kerb. A tough-looking chauffeur in a biscuit-coloured uniform hurried to open the door. Bond stepped in and settled down in the soft upholstery. The interior of the car was de-liciously cool, almost cold. The Transamerican representative bustled out with Bond\u0027s suitcase, handed it to the chauffeur and, with a half-bow, went back into the Terminal. \u0027Bill\u0027s on the Beach,\u0027 said Mr Du Pont to the chauffeur and the big car slid away through the crowded parking lots and out on to the parkway.\\n\\n Mr Du Pont settled back. \u0027Hope you like stone crabs, Mr Bond. Ever tried them?\u0027\\n\\n Bond said he had, that he liked them very much.\\n\\n Mr Du Pont talked about Bill\u0027s on the Beach and about the relative merits of stone and Alaska crab meat while the Chrysler Imperial sped through downtown Miami, along Biscayne Boulevard and across Biscayne Bay by the Douglas MacArthur Causeway. Bond made appropriate comments, letting himself be carried along on the gracious stream of speed and comfort and rich small-talk.\\n\\n They drew up at a white-painted, mock-Regency frontage in clapboard and stucco. A scrawl of pink neon said: BILL\u0027S ON THE BEACH. While Bond got out, Mr Du Pont gave his instructions to the chauffeur. Bond heard the words. \u0027The Aloha Suite,\u0027 and \u0027If there\u0027s any trouble, tell Mr Fairlie to call me here. Right?\u0027\\n\\n They went up the steps. Inside, the big room was decorated in white with pink muslin swags over the windows. There were pink lights on the tables. The restaurant was crowded with sunburned people in expensive tropical get-ups . - brilliant garish shirts, jangling gold bangles, dark glasses with jewelled rims, cute native straw hats. There was a confusion of scents. The wry smell of bodies that had been all day in the sun came through.\\n\\n Bill, a pansified Italian, hurried towards them. \u0027Why, Mr Du Pont. Is a pleasure, sir. Little crowded tonight. Soon fix you up. Please this way please.\u0027 Holding a large leather-bound menu above his head the man weaved his way between the diners to the best table in the room, a corner table for six. He pulled out two chairs, snapped his ringers for the maitre d\u0027hotel and the wine waiter, spread two menus in front of them, exchanged compliments with Mr Du Pont and left them.\\n\\n Mr Du Pont slapped his menu shut. He said to Bond, \u0027Now, why don\u0027t you just leave this to me? If there\u0027s anything you don\u0027t like, send it back.\u0027 And to the head waiter, \u0027Stone crabs. Not frozen. Fresh. Melted butter. Thick toast. Right?\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/goldfinger-james-bond-7/page-2.html","bookId":1550,"book":{"id":1550,"title":"Goldfinger (James Bond #7)","description":"Storyline: Goldfinger (James Bond (Original Series) #7) \\n Auric Goldfinger, the most phenomenal criminal Bond has ever faced, is an evil genius who likes his cash in gold bars and his women dressed only in gold paint.
