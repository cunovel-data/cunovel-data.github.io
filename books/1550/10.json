{"id":107597,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u0027The usual nosey parker in the salvage firm gossiped to one of the Dover Customs men and in due course a report filtered up through the police and the CID to me, together with a copy of the cargo clearance papers for each of Goldfinger\u0027s trips to India. These gave all the cargoes as mineral dust base for crop fertilizers - all perfectly credible because these modern fertilizers do use traces of various minerals in their make-up. The whole picture was clear as crystal. Goldfinger had been refining down his old gold, precipitating it into this brown powder and shipping it to India as fertilizer. But could we pin it on him? We could not. Had a quiet look at his bank balance and tax returns. Twenty thousand pounds at Barclays in Ramsgate. Income tax and super tax paid promptly each year. Figures showed the natural progress of a well-run jewellery business. We dressed a couple of the Gold Squad up and sent them down to knock on the door of Mr Goldfinger\u0027s factory at Reculver. “Sorry, sir, routine inspection for the Small Engineering Section of the Ministry of Labour. We have to make sure the Factory Acts are being observed for safety and health.”\\n\\n “Come in. Come in.” Mr Goldfinger positively welcomed them. Mark you, he may have been tipped off by his bank manager or someone, but that factory was entirely devoted to designing a cheap alloy for jewellers\u0027 findings - trying out unusual metals like aluminium and tin instead of the usual copper and nickel and palladium that are used in gold alloys. There were traces of gold about, of course, and furnaces to heat up to two thousand degrees and so forth, but after all Goldfinger was a jeweller and a smelter in a small way, and all this was perfectly above-board. The Gold Squad retired discomfited, our legal department decided the brown dust in the trawler\u0027s timbers was not enough to prosecute on without supporting evidence, and that was more or less that, except\u0027 - Colonel Smithers slowly wagged the stem of his pipe -\u0027that I kept the file open and started sniffing around the banks of the world.\u0027\\n\\n Colonel Smithers paused. The rumble of the City came through the half-open window high up in the wall behind his chair. Bond glanced surreptitiously at his watch. Five o\u0027clock. Colonel Smithers got up from his chair. He placed both hands palm downwards on the desk and leant forward. \u0027It took me five years, Mr Bond, to find out that Mr Goldfinger, in ready money, is the richest man in England. In Zurich, in Nassau, in Panama, in New York, he has twenty million pounds\u0027 worth of gold bars on safe deposit. And those bars, Mr Bond, are not Mint bars. They don\u0027t carry any official marks of origin whatsoever. They\u0027re bars that Mr Goldfinger has melted himself. I flew to Nassau and had a look at the five million pounds\u0027 worth or so he holds there in the vaults of the Royal Bank of Canada. Oddly enough, like all artists, he couldn\u0027t refrain from signing his handiwork. It needs a microscope to see it, but somewhere, on each Goldfinger bar, a minute letter Z has been scratched in the metal. And that gold, or most of it, belongs to England. The Bank can do nothing about it, so we are asking you to bring Mr Gold-finger to book, Mr Bond, and get that gold back. You know about the currency crisis and the high bank rate? Of course. Well, England needs that gold, badly - and the quicker the better.\u0027\\n\\n CHAPTER SEVEN\\n\\n THOUGHTS IN A DB III\\n\\n BOND FOLLOWED Colonel Smithers to the lift. While they waited for it, Bond glanced out of the tall window at the end of the passage. He was looking down into the deep well of the back courtyard of the Bank. A trim chocolate-brown lorry with no owner\u0027s name had come into the courtyard through the triple steel gates. Square cardboard boxes were being unloaded from it and put on to a short conveyor belt that disappeared into the bowels of the Bank.\\n\\n Colonel Smithers came over. \u0027Fivers,\u0027 he commented. \u0027Just come up from our printing works at Loughton.\u0027\\n\\n The lift came and they got in. Bond said, \u0027I\u0027m not very impressed by the new ones. They look like any other country\u0027s money. The old ones were the most beautiful money in the world.\u0027\\n\\n They walked across the entrance hall, now dimly lit and deserted. Colonel Smithers said, \u0027As a matter of fact I agree with you. Trouble was that those Reichsbank forgeries during the war were a darn sight too good. When the Russians captured Berlin, among the loot they got hold of the plates. We asked the Narodni Bank for them, but they refused to give them up. We and the Treasury decided it was just too dangerous. At any moment, if Moscow had been inclined, they could have started a major raid on our currency. We had to withdraw the old fivers. The new ones aren\u0027t much to look at, but at least they\u0027d be hell to forge.\u0027\\n\\n The night guard let them out on to the steps. Thread-needle Street was almost deserted. The long City night was beginning. Bond said goodbye to Colonel Smithers and walked along to the Tube. He had never thought very much about the Bank of England, but now that he had been inside the place he decided that the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street might be old but she still had some teeth left in her head.\\n\\n Bond had been told to report back to M at six. He did so. M\u0027s face was no longer pink and shining. The long day had knocked it about, stressed it, shrunken it. When Bond went in and took the chair across the desk, he noticed the conscious effort M made to clear his mind, cope with the new problem the day was to fling at him. M straightened himself in his chair and reached for his pipe. \u0027Well?\u0027\\n\\n Bond knew the false belligerence of that particular bark. He told the gist of the story in less than five minutes.\\n\\n When he had finished, M said thoughtfully, \u0027Suppose we\u0027ve got to take it on. Don\u0027t understand a thing about the pound and bank rate and all that but everyone seems to be taking it damned seriously. Personally I should have thought the strength of the pound depended on how hard we all worked rather than how much gold we\u0027d got. Germans didn\u0027t have much gold after the war. Look where they\u0027ve got in ten years. However, that\u0027s probably too easy an answer for the politicians - or more likely too difficult. Got any ideas how to tackle this chap Goldfinger? Any way of getting closer to him, offering to do some dirty work for him or something like that?\u0027\\n\\n Bond said thoughtfully, \u0027I wouldn\u0027t get anywhere sucking up to him, asking him for a job or something of that sort, sir. I should say he\u0027s the sort of man who only respects people who are tougher or smarter than he is. I\u0027ve given him one beating and the only message I got from him was that he\u0027d like me to play golf with him. Perhaps I\u0027d better do just that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fine way for one of my top men to spend his time.\u0027 The sarcasm in Ad\u0027s voice was weary, resigned. \u0027All right. Go ahead. But if what you say is right, you\u0027d better see that you beat him. What\u0027s your cover story?\u0027\\n\\n Bond shrugged. \u0027I hadn\u0027t thought, sir. Perhaps I\u0027d better be thinking of leaving Universal Export. No future in it. Having a holiday while I look round. Thinking of emigrating to Canada. Fed up here. Something like that. But perhaps I\u0027d better play it the way the cards fall. I wouldn\u0027t think he\u0027s an easy man to fool.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right. Report progress. And don\u0027t think I\u0027m not interested in this case.\u0027 M\u0027s voice had changed. So had his expression. His eyes had become urgent, commanding. \u0027Now I\u0027ll give you one piece of information the Bank didn\u0027t give you. It just happens that I also know what Mr Goldfinger\u0027s gold bars look Like. As a matter of fact I was handling one today - scratched Z and all. It had come in with that haul we made last week when the Redland Resident Director\u0027s office “caught fire” in Tangier. You\u0027ll have seen the signals. Well, that\u0027s the twentieth of these particular gold bars that have come our way since die war.\u0027\\n\\n Bond interrupted, \u0027But that Tangier bar was out of the SMERSH safe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly. I\u0027ve checked. All the other nineteen bars with the scratched Z have been taken from SMERSH operatives.\u0027 M paused. He said mildly, \u0027D\u0027you know, 007, I wouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if Goldfinger doesn\u0027t turn out to be the foreign banker, the treasurer so to speak, of SMERSH.\u0027\\n\\n James Bond flung the DBIII through the last mile of straight and did a racing change down into third and then into second for the short hill before the inevitable traffic crawl through Rochester. Leashed in by the velvet claw of the front discs, the engine muttered its protest with a mild back-popple from the twin exhausts. Bond went up into third again, beat the lights at the bottom of the hill and slid resignedly up to the back of the queue that would crawl on for a quarter of an hour - if he was lucky - through the sprawl of Rochester and Chatham.\\n\\n Bond settled back into second and let the car idle. He reached for the wide gunmetal case of Morland cigarettes on the neighbouring bucket seat, fumbled for one and lit it from the dashboard.\\n\\n He had chosen the A2 in preference to the A20 to Sandwich because he wanted to take a quick look at Goldfinger-land - Reculver and those melancholy forsaken reaches of the Thames which Goldfinger had chosen for his parish. He would then cross the Isle of Thanet to Ramsgate and leave his bag at the Channel Packet, have an early lunch and be off to Sandwich.\\n\\n The car was from the pool. Bond had been offered the Aston Martin or a Jaguar 3.4. He had taken the DBIII. Either of the cars would have suited his cover - a well-to-do, rather adventurous young man with a taste for the good, the fast things of life. But the DB III had the advantage of an up-to-date triptyque, an inconspicuous colour - battleship grey -and certain extras which might or might not come in handy. These included switches to alter the type and colour of Bond\u0027s front and rear lights if he was following or being followed at night, reinforced steel bumpers, fore and aft, in case he needed to ram, a long-barrelled Colt .45 in a trick compartment under the driver\u0027s seat, a radio pick-up tuned to receive an apparatus called the Homer, and plenty of concealed space that would fox most Customs men.\\n\\n Bond saw a chance and picked up fifty yards, sliding into a ten-yard gap left by a family saloon of slow reactions. The man at the wheel, who wore that infallible badge of the bad driver, a hat clamped firmly on the exact centre of his head, hooted angrily. Bond reached out of the window and raised an enigmatically clenched fist. The hooting stopped.\\n\\n And now what about this theory of M\u0027s? It made sense. The Russians were notoriously incompetent payers of their men. Their centres were always running out of funds - their men complaining to Moscow that they couldn\u0027t afford a square meal. Perhaps SMERSH couldn\u0027t get the valuta out of the Ministry of Home Security. Or perhaps the Ministry of Home Security couldn\u0027t get the money out of the Ministry of Finance. But it had always been the same - endless money troubles that resulted in missed chances, broken promises and waste of dangerous radio time. It would make sense to have a clever financial brain somewhere outside Russia who could not only transmit funds to the centres but also, in this case, make profits large enough to run the SMERSH centres abroad without any financial assistance from Moscow. Not only that. On the side, Goldfinger was appreciably damaging the currency base of an enemy country. If all this was correct, it was typical of SMERSH - a brilliant scheme, faultlessly operated by an outstanding man. And that, reflected Bond as he roared up the hill into Chatham, putting half a dozen cars behind him, would partly explain Goldfinger\u0027s greed for more and still more money. Devotion to the cause, to SMERSH, and perhaps the dangled prize of an Order of Lenin, would be the spur to pick up even ten or twenty thousand dollars when the odds were right or could be favourably adjusted. The funds for Red Revolution, for the discipline by fear that was the particular speciality of SMERSH, could never be big enough. Goldfinger was not making the money for himself. He was making it for the conquest of the world! The minor risk of being found out, as he had been by Bond, was nothing. Why? What could the Bank of England get him if every single one of his past operations could be exposed? Two years? Three? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/goldfinger-james-bond-7/page-10.html","bookId":1550,"book":{"id":1550,"title":"Goldfinger (James Bond #7)","description":"Storyline: Goldfinger (James Bond (Original Series) #7) \\n Auric Goldfinger, the most phenomenal criminal Bond has ever faced, is an evil genius who likes his cash in gold bars and his women dressed only in gold paint.
