{"id":107601,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u0027What\u0027s your speciality?\u0027\n Bond could feel Goldfinger\u0027s eyes on him. He said, \u0027I look after the small arms side. Spend most of my time selling miscellaneous ironmongery to sheiks and rajahs - anyone the Foreign Office decides doesn\u0027t want the stuff to shoot at us with.\u0027\n \u0027Interesting work.\u0027 Goldfinger\u0027s voice was flat, bored.\n \u0027Not very. I\u0027m thinking of quitting. Came down here for a week\u0027s holiday to think it out. Not much future in England. Rather like the idea of Canada.\u0027\n \u0027Indeed?\u0027\n They were past the rough and Bond was relieved to find that his ball had got a forward kick off the hill on to the fairway. The fairway curved slightly to the left and Bond had even managed to pick up a few feet on Goldfinger. It was Goldfinger to play. Goldfinger took out his spoon. He wasn\u0027t going for the green but only to get over the bunkers and through the valley.\n Bond waited for the usual safe shot. He looked at his own lie. Yes, he could take his brassie. There came the wooden thud of a mis-hit. Goldfinger\u0027s ball, hit off the heel, sped along the ground and into the stony wastes of Hell Bunker -the widest bunker and the only unkempt one, because of the pebbles, on the course.\n For once Homer had nodded - or rather, lifted his head. Perhaps his mind had been half on what Bond had told him. Good show! But Goldfinger might still get down in three more. Bond took out his brassie. He couldn\u0027t afford to play safe. He addressed the ball, seeing in his mind\u0027s eye its eighty-eight-millimetre trajectory through the valley and then the two or three bounces that would take it on to the green. He laid off a bit to the right to allow for his draw. Now!\n There came a soft clinking away to his right. Bond stood away from his ball. Goldfinger had his back to Bond. He was gazing out to sea, rapt in its contemplation, while his right hand played \u0027unconsciously* with the money in his pocket.\n Bond smiled grimly. He said, \u0027Could you stop shifting bullion till after my shot?\u0027\n Goldfinger didn\u0027t turn round or answer. The noise stopped.\n Bond turned back to his shot, desperately trying to clear his mind again. Now the brassie was too much of a risk. It needed too good a shot. He handed it to Hawker and took his spoon and banged the ball safely through the valley. It ran on well and stopped on the apron. A five, perhaps a four.\n Goldfinger got well out of the bunker and put his chip dead. Bond putted too hard and missed the one back. Still all square.\n The sixth, appropriately called \u0027The Virgin\u0027, is a famous short hole in the world of golf. A narrow green, almost ringed with bunkers, it can need anything from an eight to a two iron according to the wind. Today, for Bond, it was a seven. He played a soaring shot, laid off to the right for the wind to bring it in. It ended twenty feet beyond the pin with a difficult putt over and down a shoulder. Should be a three. Gold-finger took his five and played it straight. The breeze took it and it rolled into the deep bunker on the left. Good news! That would be the hell of a difficult three.\n They walked in silence to the green. Bond glanced into the bunker. Goldfinger\u0027s ball was in a deep heel-mark. Bond walked over to his ball and listened to the larks. This was going to put him one up. He looked for Hawker to take his putter, but Hawker was the other side of the green, watching with intent concentration Goldfinger play his shot. Gold-finger got down into the bunker with his blaster. He jumped up to get a view of the hole and then settled himself for the shot. As his club went up Bond\u0027s heart lifted. He was going to try and flick it out - a hopeless technique from that buried lie. The only hope would have been to explode it. Down came the club, smoothly, without hurry. With hardly a handful of sand the ball curved up out of the deep bunker, bounced once and lay dead!\n Bond swallowed. Blast his eyes! How the hell had Gold-finger managed that? Now, out of sour grapes, Bond must try for his two. He went for it, missed the hole by an inch and rolled a good yard past. Hell and damnation! Bond walked slowly up to the putt, knocking Goldfinger\u0027s ball away. Come on, you bloody fool! But the spectre of the big swing - from an almost certain one up to a possible one down - made Bond wish the ball into the hole instead of tapping it in. The coaxed ball, lacking decision, slid past the lip. One down!\n Now Bond was angry with himself. He, and he alone, had lost that hole. He had taken three putts from twenty feet. He really must pull himself together and get going.\n At the seventh, five hundred yards, they both hit good drives and Goldfinger\u0027s immaculate second lay fifty yards short of the green. Bond took his brassie. Now for the equalizer! But he hit from the top, his club head came down too far ahead of the hands and the smothered ball shot into one of the right-hand bunkers. Not a good lie, but he must put it on the green. Bond took a dangerous seven and failed to get it out. Goldfinger got his five. Two down. They halved the short eighth in three. At the ninth Bond, determined to turn only one down, again tried to do too much off a poor lie. Goldfinger got his four to Bond\u0027s five. Three down at the turn! Not too good. Bond asked Hawker for a new ball. Hawker unwrapped it slowly, waiting for Goldfinger to walk over the hillock to the next tee. Hawker said softly, \u0027You saw what he did at The Virgin, sir?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, damn him. It was an amazing shot.\u0027\n Hawker was surprised. \u0027Oh, you didn\u0027t see what he did in the bunker, sir?\u0027\n \u0027No, what? I was too far away.\u0027\n The other two were out of sight over the rise. Hawker silently walked down into one of the bunkers guarding the ninth green, kicked a hole with his toe and dropped the ball in the hole. He then stood just behind the half-buried ball with his feet close together. He looked up at Bond. \u0027Remember he jumped up to look at the line to the hole, sir?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Just watch this, sir.\u0027 Hawker looked towards the ninth pin and jumped, just as Goldfinger had done, as if to get the line. Then he looked up at Bond again and pointed to the ball at his feet. The heavy impact of the two feet just behind the ball had levelled the hole in which it had lain and had squeezed the ball out so that it was now perfectly teed for an easy shot - for just the easy cut-up shot which had seemed utterly impossible from Goldfinger\u0027s lie at The Virgin.\n Bond looked at his caddie for a moment in silence. Then he said, \u0027Thanks, Hawker. Give me the bat and the ball. Somebody\u0027s going to be second in this match, and I\u0027m damned if it\u0027s going to be me.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 said Hawker stolidly. He limped off on the short cut that would take him half way down the tenth fairway.\n Bond sauntered slowly over the rise and down to the tenth tee. He hardly looked at Goldfinger who was standing on the tee swishing his driver impatiently. Bond was clearing his mind of everything but cold, offensive resolve. For the first time since the first tee, he felt supremely confident. All he needed was a sign from heaven and his game would catch fire.\n The tenth at the Royal St Marks is the most dangerous hole on the course. The second shot, to the skiddy plateau green with cavernous bunkers to right and left and a steep hill beyond, has broken many hearts. Bond remembered that Philip Scrutton, out in four under fours in the Gold Bowl, had taken a fourteen at this hole, seven of them ping-pong shots from one bunker to another, to and fro across the green. Bond knew that Goldfinger would play his second to the apron, or short of it, and be glad to get a five. Bond must go for it and get his four.\n Two good drives and, sure enough, Goldfinger well up on the apron with his second. A possible four. Bond took his seven, laid off plenty for the breeze and fired the ball off into the sky. At first he thought he had laid off too much, but then the ball began to float to the left. It pitched and stopped dead in the soft sand blown on to the green from the right-hand bunker. A nasty fifteen-foot putt. Bond would now be glad to get a half. Sure enough, Goldfinger putted up to within a yard. That, thought Bond as he squared up to his putt, he will have to hole. He hit his own putt fairly smartly to get it through the powdering of sand and was horrified to see it going like lightning across the skiddy green. God, he was going to have not a yard, but a two-yard putt back! But suddenly, as if drawn by a magnet, the ball swerved straight for the hole, hit the back of the tin, bounced up and fell into the cup with an audible rattle. The sign from heaven! Bond went up to Hawker, winked at him and took his driver.\n They left the caddies and walked down the slope and back to the next tee. Goldfinger said coldly, \u0027That putt ought to have run off the green.\u0027\n Bond said off-handedly, \u0027Always give the hole a chance!\u0027 He teed up his ball and hit his best drive of the day down the breeze. Wedge and one putt? Goldfinger hit his regulation shot and they walked off again. Bond said, \u0027By the way, what happened to that nice Miss Masterton?\u0027\n Goldfinger looked straight in front of him. \u0027She left my employ.\u0027\n Bond thought, good for her! He said, \u0027Oh, I must get in touch with her again. Where did she go to?\u0027\n \u0027I couldn\u0027t say.\u0027 Goldfinger walked away from Bond towards his ball. Bond\u0027s drive was out of sight, over the ridge that bisected the fairway. It wouldn\u0027t be more than fifty yards from the pin. Bond thought he knew what would be in Goldfinger\u0027s mind, what is in most golfers\u0027 minds when they smell the first scent of a good lead melting away. Bond wouldn\u0027t be surprised to see that grooved swing quicken a trifle. It did. Goldfinger hooked into a bunker on the left of the green.\n Now was the moment when it would be the end of the game if Bond made a mistake, let his man off the hook. He had a slightly downhill lie, otherwise an easy chip - but to the trickiest green on the course. Bond played it like a man. The ball ended six feet from the pin. Goldfinger played well out of his bunker, but missed the longish putt. Now Bond was only one down.\n They halved the dog-leg twelfth in inglorious fives and the longish thirteenth also in fives, Goldfinger having to hole a good putt to do so.\n Now a tiny cleft of concentration had appeared on Gold-finger\u0027s massive, unlined forehead. He took a drink of water from the tap beside the fourteenth tee. Bond waited for him. He didn\u0027t want a sharp clang from that tin cup when it was out-of-bounds over the fence to the right and the drive into the breeze favouring a slice! Bond brought his left hand over to increase his draw and slowed down his swing. The drive, well to the left, was only just adequate, but at least it had stayed in bounds, Goldfinger, apparently unmoved by the out-of-bounds hazard, hit his standard shot. They both negotiated the transverse canal without damage and it was another half in five. Still one down and now only four to play.\n The four hundred and sixty yards fifteenth is perhaps the only hole where the long hitter may hope to gain one clear shot. Two smashing woods will just get you over the line of bunkers that lie right up against the green. Goldfinger had to play short of them with his second. He could hardly improve on a five and it was up to Bond to hit a really godlike second shot from a barely adequate drive.\n The sun was on its way down and the shadows of the four men were beginning to lengthen. Bond had taken up his stance. It was a good lie. He had kept his driver. There was dead silence as he gave his two incisive waggles. This was going to be a vital stroke. Remember to pause at the top of the swing, come down slow and whip the club head through at the last second. Bond began to take the club back. Something moved at the corner of his\u0027right eye. From nowhere the shadow of Goldfinger\u0027s huge head approached the ball on the ground, engulfed it and moved on. Bond let his swing take itself to pieces in sections. Then he stood away from his ball and looked up. Goldfinger\u0027s feet were still moving. He was looking carefully up at the sky. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/goldfinger-james-bond-7/page-14.html","bookId":1550,"book":{"id":1550,"title":"Goldfinger (James Bond #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Goldfinger (James Bond (Original Series) #7) \n Auric Goldfinger, the most phenomenal criminal Bond has ever faced, is an evil genius who likes his cash in gold bars and his women dressed only in gold paint.
