{"id":107591,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Directly below Bond, the elegant curve of the Cabana Club swept down to the beach - two storeys of changing-rooms below a flat roof dotted with chairs and tables and an occasional red and white striped umbrella. Within the curve was the brilliant green oblong of the Olympic-length swimming-pool fringed on all sides by row upon row of mattressed steamer chairs on which the customers would soon be getting their fifty-dollar-a-day sunburn. White-jacketed men were working among them, straightening the lines of chairs, turning the mattresses and sweeping up yesterday\u0027s cigarette butts. Beyond was the long, golden beach and the sea, and more men - raking the tideline, putting up the umbrellas, laying out mattresses. No wonder the neat card inside Bond\u0027s wardrobe had said that the cost of the Aloha Suite was two hundred dollars a day. Bond made a rough calculation. If he was paying the bill, it would take him just three weeks to spend his whole salary for the year. Bond smiled cheerfully to himself. He went back into the bedroom, picked up the telephone and ordered himself a delicious, wasteful breakfast, a carton of king-size Chesterfields and the newspapers.\\n\\n By the time he had shaved and had an ice-cold shower and dressed it was eight o\u0027clock. He walked through into the elegant sitting-room and found a waiter in a uniform of plum and gold laying out his breakfast beside the window. Bond glanced at the Miami Herald. The front page was devoted to yesterday\u0027s failure of an American ICBM at the nearby Cape Canaveral and a bad upset in a big race at Hialeah.\\n\\n Bond dropped the paper on the floor and sat down and slowly ate his breakfast and thought about Mr Du Pont and Mr Goldfinger.\\n\\n His thoughts were inconclusive. Mr Du Pont was either a much worse player than he thought, which seemed unlikely on Bond\u0027s reading of his tough, shrewd character, or else Goldfinger was a cheat. If Goldfinger cheated at cards, although he didn\u0027t need the money, it was certain that he had also made himself rich by cheating or sharp practice on a much bigger scale. Bond was interested in big crooks. He looked forward to his first sight of Goldfinger. He also looked forward to penetrating Goldfinger\u0027s highly successful and, on the face of it, highly mysterious method of fleecing Mr Du Pont. It was going to be a most entertaining day. Idly Bond waited for it to get under way.\\n\\n The plan was that he would meet Mr Du Pont in the garden at ten o\u0027clock. The story would be that Bond had flown down from New York to try and sell Mr Du Pont a block of shares from an English holding in a Canadian Natural Gas property. The matter was clearly confidential and Goldfinger would not think of questioning Bond about details. Shares, Natural Gas, Canada. That was all Bond needed to remember. They would go along together to the roof of the Cabana Club where the game was played and Bond would read his paper and watch. After luncheon, during which Bond and Mr Du Pont would discuss their \u0027business\u0027, there would be the same routine. Mr Du Pont had inquired if there was anything else he could arrange. Bond had asked for the number of Mr Goldfinger\u0027s suite and a passkey. He had explained that if Goldfinger was any kind of a professional card-sharp, or even an expert amateur, he would travel with the usual tools of the trade - marked and shaved cards, the apparatus for the Short Arm Delivery, and so forth. Mr Du Pont had said he would give Bond the key when they met in the garden. He would have no difficulty getting one from the manager.\\n\\n After breakfast, Bond relaxed and gazed into the middle distance of the sea. He was not keyed up by the job on hand, only interested and amused. It was just the kind of job he had needed to clear his palate after Mexico.\\n\\n At half past nine Bond left his suite and wandered along the corridors of his floor, getting lost on his way to the elevator in order to reconnoitre the lay-out of the hotel. Then, having met the same maid twice, he asked his way and went down in the elevator and moved among the scattering of early risers through the Pineapple Shopping Arcade. He glanced into the Bamboo Coffee Shoppe, the Rendezvous Bar, the La Tropicala dining-room, the Kittekat Klub for children and the Boom-Boom Nighterie. He then went purposefully out into the garden. Mr Du Pont, now dressed \u0027for the beach\u0027 by Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch, gave him the pass-key to Goldfinger\u0027s suite. They sauntered over to the Cabana Club and climbed the two short flights of stairs to the top deck.\\n\\n Bond\u0027s first view of Mr Goldfinger was startling. At the far corner of the roof, just below the cliff of the hotel, a man was lying back with his legs up on a steamer chair. He was wearing nothing but a yellow satin bikini slip, dark glasses and a pair of wide tin wings under his chin. The wings, which appeared to fit round his neck, stretched out across his shoulders and beyond them and then curved up slightly to rounded tips.\\n\\n Bond said, \"What the hell\u0027s he wearing round his neck?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You never seen one of those?\u0027 Mr Du Pont was surprised. \u0027That\u0027s a gadget to help your tan. Polished tin. Reflects the sun up under your chin and behind the ears - the bits that wouldn\u0027t normally catch the sun.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, well,\u0027 said Bond.\\n\\n When they were a few yards from the reclining figure Mr Du Pont called out cheerfully, in what seemed to Bond an overloud voice, \u0027Hi there!\u0027\\n\\n Mr Goldfinger did not stir.\\n\\n Mr Du Pont said in his normal voice. \u0027He\u0027s very deaf.\u0027 They were now at Mr Goldfinger\u0027s feet. Mr Du Pont repeated his hail.\\n\\n Mr Goldfinger sat up sharply. He removed his dark glasses. \u0027Why, hullo there.\u0027 He unhitched the wings from round his neck, put them carefully on the ground beside him and got heavily to his feet. He looked at Bond with slow, inquiring eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Like you to meet Mr Bond, James Bond. Friend of mine from New York. Countryman of yours. Come down to try and talk me into a bit of business.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Goldfinger held out a hand. \u0027Pleased to meet you, Mr Bomb.\u0027\\n\\n Bond took the hand. It was hard and dry. There was the briefest pressure and it was withdrawn. For an instant Mr Goldfinger\u0027s pale, china-blue eyes opened wide and stared hard at Bond. They stared right through his face to the back of his skull. Then the lids drooped, the shutter closed over the X-ray, and Mr Goldfinger took the exposed plate and slipped it away in his filing system.\\n\\n \u0027So no game today.\u0027 The voice was flat, colourless. The words were more of a statement than a question.\\n\\n \u0027Whaddya mean, no game?\u0027 shouted Mr Du Pont boisterously. \u0027You weren\u0027t thinking I\u0027d let you hang on to my money? Got to get it back or I shan\u0027t be able to leave this darned hotel,\u0027 Mr Du Pont chuckled richly. \u0027I\u0027ll tell Sam to fix the table. James here says he doesn\u0027t know much about cards and he\u0027d like to learn the game. That right, James?\u0027 He turned to Bond. \u0027Sure you\u0027ll be all right with your paper and the sunshine?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d be glad of the rest,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Been travelling too much.\u0027\\n\\n Again the eyes bored into Bond and then drooped. Til get some clothes on. I had intended to have a golf lesson this afternoon from Mr Armour at the Boca Raton. But cards have priority among my hobbies. My tendency to un-cock the wrists too early with the mid-irons will have to wait.\u0027 The eyes rested incuriously on Bond. \u0027You play golf, Mr Bomb?\u0027\\n\\n Bond raised his voice. \u0027Occasionally, when I\u0027m in England.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And where do you play?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Huntercombe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah - a pleasant little course. I have recently joined the Royal St Marks. Sandwich is close to one of my business interests. You know it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have played there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What is your handicap?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That is a coincidence. So is mine. We must have a game one day.\u0027 Mr Goldfinger bent down and picked up his tin wings. He said to Mr Du Pont, \u0027I will be with you in five minutes.\u0027 He walked slowly off towards the stairs.\\n\\n Bond was amused. This social sniffing at him had been done with just the right casual touch of the tycoon who didn\u0027t really care if Bond was alive or dead but, since he was there and alive, might as well place him in an approximate category.\\n\\n Mr Du Pont gave instructions to a steward in a white coat. Two others were already setting up a card table. Bond walked to the rail that surrounded the roof and looked down into the garden, reflecting on Mr Goldfinger.\\n\\n He was impressed. Mr Goldfinger was one of the most relaxed men Bond had ever met. It showed in the economy of his movement, of his speech, of his expressions. Mr Gold-finger wasted no effort, yet there was something coiled, compressed, in the immobility of the man.\\n\\n When Goldfinger had stood up, the first thing that had struck Bond was that everything was out of proportion. Goldfinger was short, not more than five feet tall, and on top of the thick body and blunt, peasant legs, was set almost directly into the shoulders, a huge and it seemed exactly round head. It was as if Goldfinger had been put together with bits of other people\u0027s bodies. Nothing seemed to belong. Perhaps, Bond thought, it was to conceal his ugliness that\\n\\n Goldfinger made such a fetish of sunburn. Without the red-brown camouflage the pale body would be grotesque. The face, under the cliff of crew-cut carroty hair, was as startling, without being as ugly, as the body. It was moon-shaped without being moonlike. The forehead was fine and high and the thin sandy brows were level above the large light blue eyes fringed with pale lashes. The nose was fleshily aquiline between high cheek-bones and cheeks that were more muscular than fat. The mouth was thin and dead straight, but beautifully drawn. The chin and jaws were firm and glinted with health. To sum up, thought Bond, it was the face of a thinker, perhaps a scientist, who was ruthless, sensual, stoical and tough. An odd combination.\\n\\n What else could he guess? Bond always mistrusted short men. They grew up from childhood with an inferiority complex. All their lives they would strive to be big - bigger than the others who had teased them as a child. Napoleon had been short, and Hitler. It was the short men that caused all the trouble in the world. And what about a misshapen short man with red hair and a bizarre face? That might add up to a really formidable misfit. One could certainly feel the repressions. There was a powerhouse of vitality humming in the man that suggested that if one stuck an electric bulb into Goldfinger\u0027s mouth it would light up. Bond smiled at the thought. Into what channels did Goldfinger release his vital force? Into getting rich? Into sex? Into power? Probably into all three. What could his history be? Today he might be an Englishman. What had he been born? Not a Jew - though there might be Jewish blood in him. Not a Latin or anything farther south. Not a Slav. Perhaps a German - no, a Bait! That\u0027s where he would have come from. One of the old Baltic provinces. Probably got away to escape the Russians. Goldfinger would have been warned - or his parents had smelled trouble and they had got him out in time. And what had happened then? How had he worked his way up to being one of the richest men in the world? One day it might be interesting to find out. For the time being it would be enough to find out how he won at cards.\\n\\n \u0027All set?\u0027 Mr Du Pont called to Goldfinger who was coming across the roof towards the card table. With his clothes on - a comfortably fitting dark blue suit, a white shirt open at the neck - Goldfinger cut an almost passable figure.\\n\\n But there was no disguise for the great brown and red football of a head and the flesh-coloured hearing aid plugged into the left ear was net an improvement.\\n\\n Mr Du Pont sat with his back to the hotel. Goldfinger took the seat opposite and cut the cards. Du Pont won the cut, pushed the other pack over to Goldfinger, tapped them to show they were already shuffled and he couldn\u0027t bother to cut, and Goldfinger began the deal.\\n\\n Bond sauntered over and took a chair at Mr Du Font\u0027s elbow. He sat back, relaxed. He made a show of folding his paper to the sports page and watched the deal. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/goldfinger-james-bond-7/page-4.html","bookId":1550,"book":{"id":1550,"title":"Goldfinger (James Bond #7)","description":"Storyline: Goldfinger (James Bond (Original Series) #7) \\n Auric Goldfinger, the most phenomenal criminal Bond has ever faced, is an evil genius who likes his cash in gold bars and his women dressed only in gold paint.
