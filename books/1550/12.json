{"id":107599,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Bond said, \u0027Well thanks, Alfred. I\u0027d be interested to see how this chap plays. But why not leave it like this? Say I\u0027ve dropped in to get a dub made up. Old member. Used to play here before the war. And I need a new number four wood anyway. Your old one has started to give at the seams a bit. Just be casual. Don\u0027t say you\u0027ve told me he\u0027s about. I\u0027ll stay in the shop so it\u0027ll give him a chance to take his choice without offending me. Perhaps he won\u0027t like my face or something. Right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very good, Mr James. Leave it to me. That\u0027s his car coming now, sir.\u0027 Blacking pointed through the window. Half a mile away, a bright yellow car was turning off the road and coming up the private drive. \u0027Funny looking contraption. Sort of motor car we used to see here when I was a boy.\u0027\\n\\n Bond watched the old Silver Ghost sweep majestically up the drive towards the club. She was a beauty! The sun glittered off the silver radiator and off the engine-turned aluminium shield below the high perpendicular glass cliff of the windscreen. The luggage rail on the roof of the heavy coach-built limousine body - so ugly twenty years ago, so strangely beautiful today - was polished brass, as were the two Lucas \u0027King of the Road\u0027 headlamps that stared so haughtily down the road ahead, and the wide mouth of the old boa-constrictor bulb horn. The whole car, except for a black roof and black carrosserie lines and curved panels below the windows, was primrose yellow. It crossed Bond\u0027s mind that the South\\n\\n American president might have had it copied from the famous yellow fleet in which Lord Lonsdale had driven to the Derby and Ascot.\\n\\n And now? In the driver\u0027s seat sat a figure in a cafe-au-lait dust coat and cap, his big round face obscured by black-rimmed driving goggles. Beside him was a squat figure in black with a bowler hat placed firmly on the middle of his head. The two figures stared straight in front of them with a curious immobility. It was almost as if they were driving a hearse.\\n\\n The car was coming closer. The six pairs of eyes - the eyes of the two men and the great twin orbs of the car -seemed to be looking straight through the little window and into Bond\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n Instinctively, Bond took a few paces back into the dark recesses of the workroom. He noticed the movement and smiled to himself. He picked up somebody\u0027s putter and bent down and thoughtfully addressed a knot in the wooden floor.\\n\\n PART TWO: COINCIDENCE\\n\\n CHAPTER EIGHT\\n\\n ALL TO PLAY FOR\\n\\n \u0027GOOD AFTERNOON, Blacking. All set?\u0027 The voice was casual, authoritative. \u0027I see there\u0027s a car outside. Not somebody looking for a game, I suppose?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure, sir. It\u0027s an old member come back to have a club made up. Would you like me to ask him, sir?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who is it? What\u0027s his name?\u0027\\n\\n Bond smiled grimly. He pricked his ears. He wanted to catch every inflection.\\n\\n \u0027A Mr Bond, sir.\u0027\\n\\n There was a pause. \u0027Bond?\u0027 The voice had not changed. It was politely interested. \u0027Met a fellow called Bond the other day. What\u0027s his first name?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027James, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes.\u0027 Now the pause was longer. \u0027Does he know I\u0027m here?\u0027 Bond could sense Goldfinger\u0027s antennae probing the situation.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s in the workshop, sir. May have seen your car drive up.\u0027 Bond thought: Alfred\u0027s never told a lie in his life. He\u0027s not going to start now.\\n\\n \u0027Might be an idea.\u0027 Now Goldfinger\u0027s voice unbent. He wanted something from Alfred Blacking, some information. \u0027What sort of a game does this chap play? What\u0027s his handicap?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Used to be quite useful when he was a boy, sir. Haven\u0027t seen his game since then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hm.\u0027\\n\\n Bond could feel the man weighing it all up. Bond smelled that the bait was going to be taken. He reached into his bag and pulled out his driver and started rubbing down the grip with a block of shellac. Might as well look busy. A board in the shop creaked. Bond honed away industriously, his back to the open door.\\n\\n \u0027I think we\u0027ve met before.\u0027 The voice from the doorway was low, neutral.\\n\\n Bond looked quickly over his shoulder. \u0027My God, you made me jump. Why\u0027 - recognition dawned - \u0027it\u0027s Gold, Goldman... er - Goldfinger.\u0027 He hoped he wasn\u0027t overplaying it. He said with a hint of dislike, or mistrust, \u0027Where have you sprung from?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told you I played down here. Remember?\u0027 Goldfinger was looking at him shrewdly. Now the eyes opened wide. The X-ray gaze pierced through to the back of Bond\u0027s skull.\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did not Miss Masterton give you my message?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. What was it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said I would be over here and that I would like a game of golf with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, well,\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was coldly polite, \u0027we must do that some day.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was playing with the professional. I will play with you instead.\u0027 Goldfinger was stating a fact.\\n\\n There was no doubt that Goldfinger was hooked. Now Bond must play hard to get.\\n\\n \u0027Why not some other time? I\u0027ve come to order a club. Anyway I\u0027m not in practice. There probably isn\u0027t a caddie.\u0027 Bond was being as rude as he could. Obviously the last thing he wanted to do was play with Goldfinger.\\n\\n \u0027I also haven\u0027t played for some time.\u0027 (Bloody liar, thought Bond.) \u0027Ordering a club will not take a moment.\u0027 Goldfinger turned back into the shop. \u0027Blacking, have you got a caddie for Mr Bond?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then that is arranged.\u0027\\n\\n Bond wearily thrust his driver back into his bag. \u0027Well, all right then.\u0027 He thought of a final way of putting Goldfinger off. He said roughly, \u0027But I warn you I like playing for money. I can\u0027t be bothered to knock a ball round just for the fun of it.\u0027 Bond felt pleased with the character he was building up for himself.\\n\\n Was there a glint of triumph, quickly concealed, in Gold-finger\u0027s pale eyes? He said indifferently, \u0027That suits me. Anything you like. Off handicap, of course. I think you said you\u0027re nine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n Goldfinger said carefully, \u0027Where, may I ask?5\\n\\n \u0027Huntercombe.\u0027 Bond was also nine at Sunningdale. Huntercombe was an easier course. Nine at Huntercombe wouldn\u0027t frighten Goldfinger.\\n\\n \u0027And I also am nine. Here. Up on the board. So it\u0027s a level game. Right?\u0027\\n\\n Bond shrugged. \u0027You\u0027ll be too good for me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I doubt it. However,\u0027 Goldfinger was offhand,\u0027tell you what I\u0027ll do. That bit of money you removed from me in Miami. Remember? The big figure was ten. I like a gamble. It will be good for me to have to try. I will play you double or quits for that.\u0027\\n\\n Bond said indifferently, \u0027That\u0027s too much.\u0027 Then, as if he thought better of it, thought he might win, he said - with just the right amount of craft mixed with reluctance - \u0027Of course you can say that was “found money”. I won\u0027t miss it if it goes again. Oh, well, all right. Easy come easy go. Level match. Ten thousand dollars it is.\u0027\\n\\n Goldfinger turned away. He said, and there was a sudden sweetness in the flat voice, \u0027That\u0027s all arranged then, Mr Blacking. Many thanks. Put your fee down on my account. Very sorry we shall be missing our game. Now, let me pay the caddie fees.\u0027\\n\\n Alfred Blacking came into the workroom and picked up Bond\u0027s clubs. He looked very directly at Bond. He said, \u0027Remember what I told you, sir.\u0027 One eye closed and opened again. \u0027I mean about that flat swing of yours. It needs watching - all the time.\u0027\\n\\n Bond smiled at him. Alfred had long ears. He might not have caught the figure, but he knew that somehow this was to be a key game. \u0027Thanks, Alfred. I won\u0027t forget. Four Pen-folds - with hearts on them. And a dozen tees. I won\u0027t be a minute.\u0027\\n\\n Bond walked through the shop and out to his car. The bowler-hatted man was polishing the metal work of the Rolls with a cloth. Bond felt rather than saw him stop and watch Bond take out his zip bag and go into the club house. The man had a square flat yellow face. One of the Koreans?\\n\\n Bond paid his green-fee to Hampton, the steward, and went into the changing-room. It was just the same - the same tacky smell of old shoes and socks and last summer\u0027s sweat. Why was it a tradition of the most famous golf clubs that their standard of hygiene should be that of a Victorian private school? Bond changed his socks and put on the battered old pair of nailed Saxones. He took off the coat of his yellowing black and white hound\u0027s tooth suit and pulled on a faded black wind-cheater. Cigarettes? Lighter? He was ready to go\\n\\n Bond walked slowly out, preparing his mind for the game. On purpose he had needled this man into a high, tough match so that Goldfinger\u0027s respect for him should be increased and Goldfinger\u0027s view of Bond - that he was the type of ruthless, hard .adventurer who might be very useful to Goldfinger - would be confirmed. Bond had thought that perhaps a hundred-pound Nassau would be the form. But ten thousand dollars! There had probably never been such a high singles game in history-except in the finals of American Championships or in the big amateur Calcutta Sweeps where it was the backers rather than the players who had the money on. Goldfinger\u0027s private accounting must have taken a nasty dent. He wouldn\u0027t have liked that. He would be aching to get some of his money back. When Bond had talked about playing high, Goldfinger had seen his chance. So be it. But one thing was certain, for a hundred reasons Bond could not afford to lose.\\n\\n He turned into the shop and picked up the balls and tees from Alfred Blacking.\\n\\n \u0027Hawker\u0027s got the clubs, sir.\u0027\\n\\n Bond strolled out across the five hundred yards of shaven seaside turf that led to the first tee. Goldfinger was practising on the putting green. His caddie stood near by, rolling balk to him. Goldfinger putted in the new fashion - between his legs with a mallet putter. Bond felt encouraged. He didn\u0027t believe in the system. He knew it was no good practising himself. His old hickory Calamity Jane had its good days and its bad. There was nothing to do about it. He knew also that the St Marks practice green bore no resemblance, in speed or texture, to the greens on the course.\\n\\n Bond caught up with the limping, insouciant figure of his caddie who was sauntering along chipping at an imaginary ball with Bond\u0027s blaster. \u0027Afternoon, Hawker.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Afternoon, sir.\u0027 Hawker handed Bond the blaster and threw down three used balls. His keen sardonic poacher\u0027s face split in a wry grin of welcome. \u0027HowVe you been keep in\u0027, sir? Played any golf in the last twenty years? Can you still put them on the roof of the starter\u0027s hut?\u0027 This referred to the day when Bond, trying to do just that before a match, had put two balls through the starter\u0027s window.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s see.\u0027 Bond took the blaster and hefted it in his hand, gauging the distance. The tap of the balls on the practice green had ceased. Bond addressed the ball, swung quickly, lifted his head and shanked the ball almost at right angles. He tried again. This time it was a dunch. A foot of turf flew up. The ball went ten yards. Bond turned to Hawker, who was looking his most sardonic. \u0027It\u0027s all right, Hawker. Those were for show. Now then, one for you.\u0027 He stepped up to the third ball, took his club back slowly and whipped the club head through. The ball soared a hundred feet, paused elegantly, dropped eighty feet on to the thatched roof of the starter\u0027s hut and bounced down.\\n\\n Bond handed back the club. Hawker\u0027s eyes were thoughtful, amused. He said nothing. He pulled out the driver and handed it to Bond. They walked together to the first tee, talking about Hawker\u0027s family.\\n\\n Goldfinger joined them, relaxed, impassive. Bond greeted Goldfinger\u0027s caddie, an obsequious, talkative man called Foulks whom Bond had never liked. Bond glanced at Gold-finger\u0027s clubs. They were a brand new set of American Ben Hogans with smart St Marks leather covers for the woods. The bag was one of the stitched black leather holdalls favoured by American pros. The clubs were in individual cardboard tubes for easy extraction. It was a pretentious outfit, but the best.\\n\\n \u0027Toss for honour?\u0027 Goldfinger flicked a coin.\\n\\n \u0027Tails.\u0027\\n\\n It was heads. Goldfinger took out his driver and unpeeled a new ball. He said, \u0027Dunlop 65. Number One. Always use the same ball. What\u0027s yours?\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/goldfinger-james-bond-7/page-12.html","bookId":1550,"book":{"id":1550,"title":"Goldfinger (James Bond #7)","description":"Storyline: Goldfinger (James Bond (Original Series) #7) \\n Auric Goldfinger, the most phenomenal criminal Bond has ever faced, is an evil genius who likes his cash in gold bars and his women dressed only in gold paint.
