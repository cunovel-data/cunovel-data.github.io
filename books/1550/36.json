{"id":107623,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"The girl\u0027s hand tugged at him. She screamed angrily, \u0027No, No. Stop! I want to stay close to Pussy. I\u0027ll be safe with her.\u0027\\n\\n Bond shouted back, \u0027Shut up, you little fool! Run like hell!\u0027 But now she was dragging at him, checking his speed. Suddenly she tore her hand out of his and made to dart into an open Pullman door. Christ, thought Bond, that\u0027s torn it! He whipped the knife out of his belt and swirled to meet Oddjob.\\n\\n Ten yards away Oddjob hardly paused in his rush. One hand whipped off his ridiculous, deadly hat, a glance to take aim and the black steel half-moon sang through the air. Its edge caught the girl exactly at the nape of the neck. Without a sound she fell backwards on to the platform in Oddjob\u0027s path. The hurdle was just enough to put Oddjob off the flying high kick he had started to launch at Bond\u0027s head. He turned the kick into a leap, his left hand cutting the air towards Bond like a sword. Bond ducked and struck upwards and sideways with his knife. It got home somewhere near the ribs but the momentum of the flying body knocked the knife out of his hand. There was a tinkle on the platform. Now Oddjob was coming back at him, apparently unharmed, his hands outstretched and his feet â€¢ splayed back ready for another leap or a kick. His blood was up. The eyes were red and there was a fleck of saliva at the open, panting mouth.\\n\\n Above the boom and rattle of the guns outside the station, three blasts sounded on the diesel\u0027s windhorn. Oddjob snarled angrily and leapt. Bond dived at full length sideways. Something hit him a gigantic blow on the shoulder and sent him sprawling. Now, he thought as he hit the ground, now the death stroke! He scrambled clumsily to his feet, his neck hunched into his shoulders to break the impact. But no blow came and Bond\u0027s dazed eyes took in the figure of Oddjob flying away from him up the platform.\\n\\n Already the leading diesel was on the move. Oddjob got to it and leapt for the footplate. For a moment he hung, his legs scrabbling for a foothold. Then he had disappeared into the cabin and the huge streamlined engine gathered speed.\\n\\n Behind Bond the door of the quartermaster\u0027s office burst open. There was the hammer of running feet and a yell \u0027Santiago!\u0027 - St James, the battle-cry of Cortez that Leiter had once jokingly allotted to Bond.\\n\\n Bond swivelled. The straw-haired Texan, clad in his wartime Marine Corps battledress, was pounding up the platform followed by a dozen men in khaki. He carried a one-man bazooka by the steel hook he used for a right hand. Bond ran to meet him. He said, \u0027Don\u0027t shoot my fox, you bastard. Give over.\u0027 He snatched the bazooka out of Leiter\u0027s hand and threw himself down on the platform, splaying out his legs. Now the diesel was two hundred yards away and about to cross the bridge over the Dixie Highway. Bond shouted, \u0027Stand clear!\u0027 to get the men out of line of the recoil flash, clicked up the safe and took careful aim. The bazooka shuddered slightly and the ten-pound armour-piercing rocket was on its way. There was a flash and a puff of blue smoke. Some bits of metal flew off the rear of the flying engine. But then it had crossed the bridge and taken the curve and was away.\\n\\n \u0027Not bad for a rookie,\u0027 commented Leiter. \u0027May put the rear diesel out, but those jobs are twins and he can make it on the forward engine.\u0027\\n\\n Bond got to his feet. He smiled warmly into the hawk-like, slate-grey eyes. \u0027You bungling oaf,\u0027 he said sarcastically, \u0027why in hell didn\u0027t you block that line?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listen, shamus. If you\u0027ve got any complaints about the stage management you can tell them to the President. He took personal command of this operation and it\u0027s a honey. There\u0027s a spotter plane overhead now. They\u0027ll pick up the diesel and we\u0027ll have old Goldilocks in the hoosegow by midday. How were we to know he was going to stay aboard the train?\u0027 He broke off and thumped Bond between the shoulderblades. \u0027Hell, I\u0027m glad to see you. These men and I were detailed off to give you protection. We\u0027ve been dodging around looking for you and getting shot at by both sides for our pains.\u0027 He turned to the soldiers. \u0027Ain\u0027t that right, men?\u0027\\n\\n They laughed. \u0027Sure is, Cap\u0027n.\u0027\\n\\n Bond looked affectionately at the Texan with whom he had shared so many adventures. He said seriously, \u0027Bless you, Felix. You\u0027ve always been good at saving my life. It was darn nearly too late this time. I\u0027m afraid Tilly Masterton\u0027s had it.\u0027 He walked off up the train with Felix at his heels. The little figure still lay sprawled where she had fallen. Bond knelt beside her. The broken-doll angle of the head was enough. He felt for her pulse. He got up. He said softly, \u0027Poor little bitch. She didn\u0027t think much of men.\u0027 He looked defensively at Leiter. \u0027Felix, I could have got her away if she\u0027d only followed me.\u0027\\n\\n Leiter didn\u0027t understand. He put his hand on Bond\u0027s arm and said, \u0027Sure kid. Take it easy.\u0027 He turned to his men. \u0027Two of you carry the girl into the QM\u0027s office over there. O\u0027Brien, you go for the ambulance. When you\u0027ve done that, stop over at the Command post and give \u0027em the facts. Say we\u0027ve got Commander Bond and I\u0027ll bring him right over.\u0027\\n\\n Bond stood and looked down at the little empty tangle of limbs and clothes. He saw the bright, proud girl with the spotted handkerchief round her hair in the flying TR3. Now she had gone.\\n\\n High up over his head a whirling speck soared into the sky. It reached the top of its flight and paused. There came the sharp crack of the maroon. It was the cease-fire.\\n\\n CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\\n\\n THE LAST TRICK\\n\\n IT WAS two days later. Felix Leiter was weaving the black Studillac fast through the lanes of dawdling traffic on the Triborough bridge. There was plenty of time to catch Bond\u0027s plane, the evening BOAC Monarch to London, but Leiter enjoyed shaking up Bond\u0027s low opinion of American cars. Now the steel hook that he used for a right hand banged the gear lever into second and the low black car leapt for a narrow space between a giant refrigerator truck and a mooning Oldsmobile whose rear window was almost obscured by holiday stickers.\\n\\n Bond\u0027s body jerked back with the kick of the 300 b.h.p. and his teeth snapped shut. When the manoeuvre was completed, and the angry hooting had vanished behind them, Bond said mildly, \u0027It\u0027s time you graduated out of the Kiddi-car class and bought yourself an express carriage. You want to get cracking. This pedalling along ages one. One of these days you\u0027ll stop moving altogether and when you stop moving is when you start to die.\u0027\\n\\n Leiter laughed. He said, \u0027See that green light ahead? Bet I can make it before it goes red.\u0027 The car leapt forward as if it had been kicked. There was a brief hiatus in Bond\u0027s life, an impression of snipe-like flight and of a steel wall of cars that someone parted before the whiplash of Leiter\u0027s triple klaxons, a hundred yards when the speedometer touched ninety and they were across the lights and cruising genteelly along in the centre lane.\\n\\n Bond said calmly, \u0027You meet the wrong traffic cop arid that Pinkerton card of yours won\u0027t be good enough. It isn\u0027t so much that you drive slowly, it\u0027s holding back the cars behind they\u0027ll book you for. The sort of car you need is a nice elderly Rolls Royce Silver Ghost with big plate-glass windows so you can enjoy the beauties of nature\u0027 - Bond gestured towards a huge automobile junk heap on their right. \u0027Maximum fifty and it can stop and even go backwards if you want to. Bulb horn. Suit your sedate style. Matter of fact there should be one on the market soon - Goldfinger\u0027s. And by the same token, what the hell\u0027s happened to Goldfinger? Haven\u0027t they caught up with him yet?\u0027\\n\\n Leiter glanced at his watch and edged into the outside lane. He brought the car down to forty. He said seriously, \u0027Tell you the truth, we\u0027re all a bit worried. The papers are needling us, or rather Edgar Hoover\u0027s crowd, like hell. First they had a gripe at the security clamp-down on you. We couldn\u0027t tell them that wasn\u0027t our fault and that someone in London, an old limey called M, had insisted on it. So they\u0027re getting their own back. Say we\u0027re dragging our feet and so forth. And I\u0027m telling you, James\u0027 - Leiter\u0027s voice was glum, apologetic - \u0027we just haven\u0027t a clue. They caught up with the diesel. Goldfinger had fixed the controls at thirty and had let it run on down the line. Somewhere he and the Korean had got off and probably this Galore girl and the four hoods as well because they\u0027ve vanished too. We found his truck con voy, of course, waiting on the east-bound highway out of Elizabethville. But never a driver, most probably scattered, but somewhere there\u0027s Goldfinger and a pretty tough team hiding up. They didn\u0027t get to the Sverdlovsk cruiser at Norfolk. We had a plain-clothes guard scattered round the docks and they report that she sailed to schedule without any strangers going aboard. Not a cat\u0027s been near that warehouse on East River and no one\u0027s shown at Idlewild or the frontiers - Mexico and Canada. For my money, that Jed Midnight has somehow got them out to Cuba. If they\u0027d taken two or three trucks from the convoy and driven like hell they could have got down to Florida, somewhere like Daytona Beach, by the early hours of D + l. And Midnight\u0027s darn well organized down there. The Coast Guards and the Air Force have put out all they\u0027ve got, but nothing\u0027s shown yet. But they could have hidden up during the day and got over to Cuba during the night. It\u0027s got everybody worried as hell and it\u0027s no help that the President\u0027s hopping mad.\u0027\\n\\n Bond had spent the previous day in Washington treading the thickest, richest red carpet. There had been speeches at the Bureau of the Mint, a big brass lunch at the Pentagon, an embarrassing quarter of an hour with the President, and the rest of the day had been hard work with a team of stenographers in Edgar Hoover\u0027s suite of offices with a colleague of Bond\u0027s from Station A sitting in. At the end of that, there had been a brisk quarter of an hour\u0027s talk with M on the Embassy transatlantic scrambler. M had told him what had been happening on the European end of the case. As Bond had expected, Goldfinger\u0027s cable to Universal Export had been treated as emergency. The factories at Reculver and Coppet had been searched and extra evidence of the gold smuggling racket had been found. The Indian Government had been warned about the Mecca plane that was already en route for Bombay and that end of the operation was on the way to being cleaned up. The Swiss Special Brigade had quickly found Bond\u0027s car and had got on to the route by which Bond and the girl had been taken to America, but there, at Idlewild, the FBI had lost the scent. M seemed pleased with the way Bond had handled Operation Grand Slam, but he said the Bank of England were worrying him about Goldfinger\u0027s twenty million pounds in gold. Goldfinger had assembled all this at the Paragon Safe Deposit Co in\\n\\n New York but had withdrawn it on D-l. He and his men had driven it away in a covered truck. The Bank of England had ready an Order in Council to impound the gold when it was found and there would then be a case to prove that it had been smuggled out of England, or at least that it was originally smuggled gold whose value had been increased by various doubtful means. But this was now being handled by the US Treasury and the FBI and, since M had no jurisdiction in America, Bond had better come home at once and help tidy things up. Oh yes - at the end of the conversation M\u0027s voice had sounded gruff - there had been a very kind request to the PM that Bond should be allowed to accept the American Medal of Merit. Of course M had had to explain via the PM that the Service didn\u0027t go in for those sort of things-particularly from foreign countries, however friendly they were. Too bad, but M knew that this was what Bond would have expected. He knew the rules. Bond had said yes of course and thank you very much and he\u0027d take the next plane home.\\n\\n Now,, as they motored quietly down the Van Wyck Expressway, Bond was feeling vaguely dissatisfied. He didn\u0027t like leaving ragged ends to a case. None of the big gangsters had been put in the bag and he had failed in the two tasks he had been given, to get Goldfinger and get Goldfinger\u0027s bullion. It was nothing but a miracle that Operation Grand Slam had been broken. It had been two days before the Beechcraft had been serviced and the cleaner who found the note had got to Pinkerton\u0027s only half an hour before Leiter was due to go off to the Coast on a big racing scandal. But then Leiter had really got cracking - to his chief, then to the FBI and the Pentagon. The FBI\u0027s knowledge of Bond\u0027s record, plus contact with M through the Central Intelligence Agency, had been enough to get the whole case up to the President within an hour. After that it had just been a case of building up the gigantic bluff in which all the inhabitants of Fort Knox had participated in one way or another. The two \u0027Japanese\u0027 had been taken easily enough and it was confirmed by Chemical Warfare that the three pints of GB carried as gin in their briefcases would have been enough to slay the entire population of Fort Knox. The two men had been quickly and forcibly grilled into explaining the form of the all clear cable to Goldfinger. The cable had been sent. Then the Army had declared emergency. Road and rail and air blocks had turned back all traffic to the Fort Knox area with the exception of the gangster convoys which had not been hindered. The rest was play-acting right down to the pink froth and the squalling babies which it was thought would add nice touches of verisimilitude. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/goldfinger-james-bond-7/page-36.html","bookId":1550,"book":{"id":1550,"title":"Goldfinger (James Bond #7)","description":"Storyline: Goldfinger (James Bond (Original Series) #7) \\n Auric Goldfinger, the most phenomenal criminal Bond has ever faced, is an evil genius who likes his cash in gold bars and his women dressed only in gold paint.
