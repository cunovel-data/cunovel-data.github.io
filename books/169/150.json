{"id":4970,"no":150,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"Dors Venabili disapproved, as she said to Hari Seldon \"You\u0027ve spent four days at the Galactic Library. Completely out of touch and again you managed to go without me.\" \n Husband and wife stared at each other\u0027s image on their holoscreens. Hari had just returned from a research trip to the Galactic Library in Imperial Sector. He was calling Dors from his Project office to let her know he\u0027d returned to Streeling. Even in anger, thought Hari, Dors is beautiful. He wished he could reach out and touch her cheek. \n \"Dors,\" he began, a placating note in his voice, \"I did not go alone. I had a number of people with me and the Galactic Library, of all places, is safe for scholars, even in these turbulent times. I am going to have to be at the Library more and more often, I think, as time goes on.\" \n \"And you\u0027re going to continue to do it without telling me?\" \n \"Dors, I can\u0027t live according to these death-filled views of yours. Nor Rio I want you running after me and upsetting the librarians. They\u0027re not the junta. I need them and I don\u0027t want to make them angry. But I do think that I-we-should take an apartment nearby.\" \n Dors looked grim, shook her head, and changed the subject. \"Do you know that I had two talks with Yugo recently?\" \n \"Good. I\u0027m glad you did. He needs contact with the outside world.\" \n \"Yes, he does, because something\u0027s wrong with him. He\u0027s not the 1\u0027ugo we\u0027ve had with us all these years. He\u0027s become vague, distant, and -oddly enough-passionate on only one point, as nearly as I can tell-his determination to succeed you on your retirement.\" \n \"That would be natural-if he survives me.\" \n \"Don\u0027t you expect him to survive you?\" \n \"Well, he\u0027s eleven years younger than I am, but the vicissitudes of circumstance-\" \n \"What you really mean is that you recognize that Yugo is in a bad way. He looks and acts older than you do, for all his younger age, and that seems to be a rather recent development. Is he ill?\" \n \"Physically? I don\u0027t think so. He has his periodic examinations. I\u0027ll admit, though, that he seems drained. I\u0027ve tried to persuade him to take a vacation for a few months-a whole year\u0027s sabbatical, if he wishes. I\u0027ve suggested that he leave Trantor altogether, just so that he is as far away from the Project as possible for a while. There would be no problem in financing his stay on Getorin-which is a pleasant resort world not too many light-years away.\" \n Dors shook her head impatiently. \"And, of course, he won\u0027t. I suggested a vacation to him and he acted as though he didn\u0027t know the meaning of the word. He absolutely refused.\" \n \"So what can we do?\" said Seldon. \n Dors said, \"We can think a little. Yugo worked for a quarter of a century on the Project and seemed to maintain his strength without any trouble at all and now suddenly he has weakened. It can\u0027t be age. He\u0027s not yet fifty.\" \n \"Are you suggesting something?\" \n \"Yes. How long have you and Yugo been using this Electro-Clarifier thing on your Prime Radiants?\" \n \"About two years-maybe a little more.\" \n \"I presume that the Electro-Clarifier is used by anyone who uses the Prime Radiant.\" \n \"That\u0027s right.\" \n \"Which means Yugo and you, mostly?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"And Yugo more than you?\" \n \"Yes. Yugo concentrates fiercely on the Prime Radiant and its equations. 1, unfortunately, have to spend much of my time on administrative duties.\" \n \"And what effect does the Electro-Clarifier have on the human body?\" \n Seldon looked surprised. \"Nothing of any significance that I am aware of.\" \n \"In that case, explain something to me, Hari. The Electro-Clarifier has been in operation for over two years and in that time you\u0027ve grown measurably more tired, crotchety, and a little-out of touch. Why is that?\" \n \"I\u0027m getting older, Dors.\" \n \"Nonsense. Whoever told you that sixty is crystallized senility? You\u0027re using your age as a crutch and a defense and I want you to stop it. Yugo, though he\u0027s younger, has been exposed to the Electro-Clarifier more than you have and, as a result, he is more tired, more crotchety, and, in my opinion, a great deal less in touch than you are. And he is rather childishly intense about the succession. Don\u0027t you see anything significant in this?\" \n \"Age and overwork. That\u0027s significant.\" \n \"No, it\u0027s the Electro-Clarifier. It\u0027s having a long-term effect on the two of you.\" \n After a pause, Seldon said, \"I can\u0027t disprove that, Dors, but I don\u0027t see how it\u0027s possible. The Electro-Clarifier is a device that produces an unusual electronic field, but it is still only a field of the type to which human beings are constantly exposed. It can\u0027t do any unusual harm. -In any case, we can\u0027t give up its use. There\u0027s no way of continuing the progress of the Project without it.\" \n \"Now, Hari, I must ask something of you and you must cooperate with me on this. Go nowhere outside the Project without telling me and do nothing out of the ordinary without telling me. Do you understand?\" \n \"Dors, how can I agree to this? You\u0027re trying to put me into a straitjacket.\" \n \"It\u0027s just for a while. A few days. A week.\" \n \"What\u0027s going to happen in a few days or a week?\" \n Dors said, \"Trust me. I will clear up everything.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46807.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
