{"id":4886,"no":66,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"They faced each other in Seldon\u0027s private office, his \"thinking place,\" as he called it. There, he had spent uncounted hours trying to think his way past and through the complexities of Imperial and Trantorian government. \\n\\n He said, \"Have you read much about the recent breakdowns we\u0027ve been having in planetary services, Raych?\" \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Raych, \"but you know, Dad, we\u0027ve got an old planet here. What we gotta do is get everyone off it, dig the whole thing up, replace everything, add the latest computerizations, and then bring everyone back-or at least half of everyone. Trantor would be much better off with only twenty billion people.\" \\n\\n \"Which twenty billion?\" asked Seldon smiling. \\n\\n \"I wish I knew,\" said Raych darkly. \"The trouble is, we can\u0027t redo the planet, so we just gotta keep patching.\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid so, Raych, but there are some peculiar things about it. Now I want you to check me out. I have some thoughts about this.\" \\n\\n He brought a small sphere out of his pocket. \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" asked Raych. \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a map of Trantor, carefully programmed. Do me a favor, Raych, and clear off this tabletop.\" \\n\\n Seldon placed the sphere more or less in the middle of the table and placed his hand on a keypad in the arm of his desk chair. He used his thumb to close a contact and the light in the room went out while the tabletop glowed with a soft ivory light that seemed about a centimeter deep. The sphere had flattened and expanded to the edges of the table. \\n\\n The light slowly darkened in spots and took on a pattern. After some thirty seconds, Raych said in surprise, \"It is a map of Trantor.\" \\n\\n \"Of course. I told you it was. You can\u0027t buy anything like this at a sector mall, though. This is one of those gadgets the armed forces play with. It could present Trantor as a sphere, but a planar projection would more clearly show what I want to show.\" \\n\\n \"And what is it you want to show, Dad?\" \\n\\n \"Well, in the last year or two, there have been breakdowns. As you say, it\u0027s an old planet and we\u0027ve got to expect breakdowns, but they\u0027ve been coming more frequently and they would seem, almost uniformly, to be the result of human error.\" \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that reasonable?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, of course. Within limits. This is true, even where earthquakes are involved.\" \\n\\n \"Earthquakes? On Trantor?\" \\n\\n \"I admit Trantor is a fairly nonseismic planet-and a good thing, too, because enclosing a world in a dome when the world is going to shake itself badly several times a year and smash a section of that dome would be highly impractical. Your mother says that one of the reasons Trantor, rather than some other world, became the Imperial capital is that it was geologically moribund-that\u0027s her unflattering expression. Still, it might be moribund, but it\u0027s not dead. There are occasional minor earthquakes -three of them in the last two years.\" \\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t aware of that, Dad.\" \\n\\n \"Hardly anyone is. The dome isn\u0027t a single object. It exists in hundreds of sections, each one of which can be lifted and set ajar to relieve tensions and compressions in case of an earthquake. Since an earthquake, when one does occur, lasts for only ten seconds to a minute, the opening endures only briefly. It comes and goes so rapidly that the Trantorians beneath are not even aware of it. They are much more aware of a mild tremor and a faint rattling of crockery than of the opening and closing of the dome overhead and the slight intrusion of the outside weather-whatever it is.\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s good, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \"It should be. It\u0027s computerized, of course. The onset of an earthquake anywhere sets off the key controls for the opening and closing of that section of the dome so that it opens just before the vibration becomes strong enough to do damage.\" \\n\\n \"Still good.\" \\n\\n \"But in the case of the three minor earthquakes over the last two years, the dome controls failed in each case. The dome never opened and, in each case, repairs were required. It took some time, it took some money, and the weather controls were less than optimum for a considerable period of time. Now, what, Raych, are the chances that the equipment would have failed in all three cases?\" \\n\\n \"Not high?\" \\n\\n \"Not high at all. Less than one in a hundred. One can suppose that someone had gimmicked the controls in advance of an earthquake. Now, about once a century, we have a magma leak, which is far more difficult to control-and I\u0027d hate to think of the results if it went unnoticed until it was too late. Fortunately that hasn\u0027t happened and isn\u0027t likely to, but consider- Here on this map you will find the location of the breakdowns that have plagued us over the past two years and that seem to be attributable to human error, though we haven\u0027t once been able to tell to whom each might be attributed.\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s because everyone is busy protecting his back.\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re right. That\u0027s a characteristic of any bureaucracy and Trantor\u0027s is the largest in history. -But what do you think of the locations?\" \\n\\n The map had lit up with bright little red markings that looked like small pustules covering the land surface of Trantor. \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Raych cautiously, \"they seem to be evenly spread.\" \\n\\n \"Exactly- and that\u0027s what\u0027s interesting. One would expect that the older sections of Trantor, the longest-domed sections, would have the most decayed infrastructure and would be more liable to events requiring quick human decision and laying the groundwork for possible human error. -I\u0027ll superimpose the older sections of Trantor on the map in a bluish color and you\u0027ll notice that the breakdowns don\u0027t seem to be taking place any oftener on the blue areas.\" \\n\\n \"And?\" \\n\\n \"And what I think it means, Raych, is that the breakdowns are not of natural origin but are deliberately caused and spread out in this fashion to affect as many people as possible, thus creating a dissatisfaction that is as widespread as possible.\" \\n\\n \"It don\u0027t seem likely.\" \\n\\n \"No? Then let\u0027s look at the breakdowns as spread through time rather than through space.\" \\n\\n The blue areas and the red spots disappeared and, for a time, the map of Trantor was blank-and then the markings began to appear and disappear one at a time, here and there. \\n\\n \"Notice,\" said Seldon, \"that they don\u0027t appear in clumps in time, either. One appears, then another, then another, and so on, almost like the steady ticking of a metronome.\" \\n\\n \"Do ya think that\u0027s on purpose, too?\" \\n\\n \"It must be. Whoever is bringing this about wants to cause as much disruption with as little effort as possible, so there\u0027s no use doing two at once, where one will partially cancel the other in the news and in the public consciousness. Each incident must stand out in full irritation.\" \\n\\n The map went out and the lights went on. Seldon returned the sphere, shrunken back to its original size, to his pocket. \\n\\n Raych said, \"Who would be doing all this?\" \\n\\n Seldon said thoughtfully, \"A few days ago I received a report of a murder in Wye Sector.\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s not unusual,\" said Raych. \"Even though Wye isn\u0027t one of your really lawless sectors, there must be lots of murders there every day.\" \\n\\n \"Hundreds,\" said Seldon, shaking his head. \"We\u0027ve had bad days when the number of deaths by violence on Trantor as a whole approaches the million-a-day mark. Generally there\u0027s not much chance of finding every culprit, every murderer. The dead just enter the books as statistics. This one, however, was unusual. The man had been knifed-but unskillfully. He was still alive when found, just barely. He had time to gasp out one word before he died and that word was `Chief.\u0027 \\n\\n \"That roused a certain curiosity and he was actually identified. He works in Anemoria and we don\u0027t know what he was doing in Wye. But some worthy officer managed to dig up the fact that he was an old Joranumite. His name was Kaspal Kaspalov and he is well known to have been one of the intimates of Laskin Joranum. And now he\u0027s deadknifed.\" \\n\\n Raych frowned. \"Do you suspect another Joranumite Conspiracy, Dad? There aren\u0027t any Joranumites around anymore.\" \\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t long ago that your mother asked me if I thought that the Joranumites were still active and I told her that any odd belief always retained a certain cadre, sometimes for centuries. They\u0027re usually not very important, just splinter groups that simply don\u0027t count. Still, what if the Joranumites have kept up an organization, what if they have retained a certain strength, what if they are capable of killing someone they consider a traitor in their ranks, and what if they are producing these breakdowns as a preliminary to seizing control?\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s an awful lot of `what if \u0027s,\u0027 Dad.\" \\n\\n \"I know that. And I might be totally wrong. The murder happened in Wye and, as it so happens, there have been no infrastructure breakdowns in Wye.\" \\n\\n \"What does that prove?\" \\n\\n \"It might prove that the center of the conspiracy is in Wye and that the conspirators don\u0027t want to make themselves uncomfortable, only the rest of Trantor. It also might mean that it\u0027s not the Joranumites at all but members of the old Wyan family who still dream of ruling the Empire once again.\" \\n\\n \"Oh boy, Dad. You\u0027re building all this on very little.\" \\n\\n \"I know. Now suppose it is another Joranumite Conspiracy. Joranum had, as his right-hand man, Gambol Deen Namarti. We have no record of Namarti\u0027s death, no record of his having left Trantor, no record of his life over the last decade or so. That\u0027s not terribly surprising. After all, it\u0027s easy to lose one person among forty billion. There was a time in my life when I tried to do just that. Of course, Namarti may be dead. That would be the easiest explanation, but he may not be.\" \\n\\n \"What do we do about it?\" \\n\\n Seldon sighed. \"The logical thing would be to turn to the security establishment, but I can\u0027t. I don\u0027t have Demerzel\u0027s presence. He could cow people; I can\u0027t. He had a powerful personality; I\u0027m just a-mathematician. I shouldn\u0027t be First Minister at all; I\u0027m not cut out for it. And I wouldn\u0027t be-if the Emperor weren\u0027t fixated on psychohistory to a far greater extent than it deserves.\" \\n\\n \"You\u0027re kinda whipping yourself, ain\u0027t you, Dad?\" \\n\\n \"Yes. I suppose I am, but I have a picture of myself going to the security establishment, for instance, with what I have just shown you on the map\"-he pointed to the now-empty tabletop-\"and arguing that we were in great danger of some conspiracy of unknown consequence and nature. They would listen solemnly and, after I had left, they would laugh among themselves about `the crazy mathematician\u0027-and then do nothing.\u0027 \\n\\n \"Then what do we do about it?\" said Raych, returning to the point. \\n\\n \"It\u0027s what you will do about it, Raych. I need more evidence and I want you to find it for me. I would send your mother, but she won\u0027t leave me under any circumstances. I myself can\u0027t leave the Palace grounds at this time. Next to Dors and myself, I trust you. More than Dors and myself, in fact. You\u0027re still quite young, you\u0027re strong, you\u0027re a better Heliconian Twister than I ever was, and you\u0027re smart. \\n\\n \"Mind you, now, I don\u0027t want you to risk your life. No heroism, no derring-do. I couldn\u0027t face your mother if anything happened to you. Just find out what you can. Perhaps you\u0027ll find that Namarti is alive and operating-or dead. Perhaps you\u0027ll find out that the Joranumites are an active group-or moribund. Perhaps you\u0027ll find out that the Wyan ruling family is active-or not. Any of that would be interesting-but not vital. What I want you to find out is whether the infrastructure breakdowns are of human manufacture, as I think they are, and, far more important still, if they are deliberately caused, what else the conspirators plan to do. It seems to me they must have plans for some major coup and, if so, I must know what that will be.\" \\n\\n Raych said cautiously, \"Do you have some kinda plan to get me started?\" \\n\\n \"Yes indeed, Raych. I want you to go down to the area of Wye where Kaspalov was killed. Find out if you can if he was an active Joranumite and see if you can\u0027t join a Joranumite cell yourself.\" \\n\\n \"Maybe that\u0027s possible. I can always pretend to be an old Joranumite. It\u0027s true that I was pretty young when Jo-Jo was sounding off, but I was very impressed by his ideas. It\u0027s even sorta true.\" \\n\\n \"Well yes, but there\u0027s one important catch. You might be recognized. After all, you\u0027re the son of the First Minister. You have appeared on holovision now and then and you have been interviewed concerning your views on sector equality.\" \\n\\n \"Sure, but-\" \\n\\n \"No buts, Raych. You\u0027ll wear elevated shoes to add three centimeters to your height and we\u0027ll have someone show you how to change the shape of your eyebrows and make your face fuller and change the timbre of your voice.\" \\n\\n Raych shrugged. \"A lotta trouble for nothing.\" \\n\\n \"And,\" said Seldon with a distinct quaver, \"you will shave off your mustache.\" \\n\\n Raych\u0027s eyes widened and for a moment he sat there in appalled silence. Finally he said in a hoarse whisper, \"Shave my mustache?\" \\n\\n \"Clean as a whistle. No one would recognize you without it.\" \\n\\n \"But it can\u0027t be done. Like cutting off your- Like castration.\" \\n\\n Seldon shook his head. \"It\u0027s just a cultural curiosity. Yugo Amaryl is as Dahlite as you are and he wears no mustache.\" \\n\\n \"Yugo is a nut. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s alive at all, except for his mathematics.\" \\n\\n \"He\u0027s a great mathematician and the absence of a mustache does not alter that fact. Besides, it\u0027s not castration. Your mustache will grow back in two weeks.\" \\n\\n \"Two weeks! It\u0027ll take two years to reach this-this-\" \\n\\n He put his hand up, as though to cover and protect it. \\n\\n Seldon said inexorably, \"Raych, you have to do it. It\u0027s a sacrifice you must make. If you act as my spy with your mustache, you may-come to harm. I can\u0027t take that chance.\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather die,\" said Raych violently. \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be melodramatic,\" said Seldon severely. \"You would not rather die and this is something you must do. However\"-and here he hesitated-\"don\u0027t say anything about it to your mother. I will take care of that.\" \\n\\n Raych stared at his father in frustration and then said in a low and despairing tone, \"All right, Dad.\" \\n\\n Seldon said, \"I will get someone to supervise your disguise and then you will go to Wye by air-jet. -Buck up, Raych, it\u0027s not the end of the world.\" \\n\\n Raych smiled wanly and Seldon watched him leave, a deeply troubled look on his face. A mustache could easily be regrown, but a son could not. Seldon knew perfectly well that he was sending Raych into danger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46647.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
