You never hear of anyone, except for the few who obtrude themselves on your notice. With all the computerized information in the world, Trantor remains a planet of anonymities. We can drag up people with their reference numbers and their statistics, but whom do we drag up? Add twenty-five million Outer Worlds and the wonder is that the Galactic Empire has remained a working phenomenon for all these millennia. Frankly I think it has existed only because it very largely runs itself. And now it is finally running down.\" \"So much for philosophizing, Hari,\" said Dors. \"Who is this Andorin?\" \"Someone I admit I ought to have known about. I managed to cajole the security establishment into calling up some files on him. He\u0027s a member of the Wyan Mayoralty family-the most prominent member, in fact -so the security people have kept tabs on him. They think he has ambitions but is too much of a playboy to do anything about them.\" \"And is he involved with the Joranumites?\" Seldon made an uncertain gesture. \"I\u0027m under the impression that the security establishment knows nothing about the Joranumites. That may mean that the Joranumites no longer exist or that, if they do, they are of no importance. It may also mean that the security establishment just isn\u0027t interested. Nor is there any way in which I can force it to be interested. I\u0027m only thankful the officers give me any information at all. And I am the First Minister.\" \"Is it possible that you\u0027re not a very good First Minister?\" said Dors, dryly. \"That\u0027s more than possible. It\u0027s probably been generations since there\u0027s been an appointee less suited to the job than myself. But that has nothing to do with the security establishment. It\u0027s a totally independent arm of the government. I doubt that Cleon himself knows much about it, though, in theory, the security officers are supposed to report to him through their director. Believe me, if we only knew more about the security establishment, we\u0027d be trying to stick its actions into our psychohistorical equations, such as they are.\" \"Are the security officers on our side, at least?\" \"I believe so, but I can\u0027t swear to it.\" \"And why are you interested in this what\u0027s-his-name?\" \"Gleb Andorin. Because I received a roundabout message from Raych.\" Dors\u0027s eyes flashed. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me? Is he all right?\" \"As far as I know, but I hope he doesn\u0027t try any further messages. If he\u0027s caught communicating, he won\u0027t be all right. In any case, he has made contact with Andorin.\" \"And the Joranumites, too?\" \"I don\u0027t think so. It would sound unlikely, for the connection is not something that would make sense. The Joranumite movement is predominantly lower-class-a proletarian movement, so to speak. And Andorin is an aristocrat of aristocrats. What would he be doing with the Joranumites?\" \"If he\u0027s of the Wyan Mayoralty family, he might aspire to the Imperial throne, might he not?\" \"They\u0027ve been aspiring for generations. You remember Rashelle, I trust. She was Andorin\u0027s aunt.\" \"Then he might be using the Joranumites as a stepping-stone, don\u0027t you think?\" \"If they exist. And if they do-and if a stepping-stone is what Andorin wants-I think he\u0027d find himself playing a dangerous game. The Joranumites-if they exist-would have their own plans and a man like Andorin may find he\u0027s simply riding a greti-\" \"What\u0027s a greti?\" \"Some extinct animal of a ferocious type, I think. It\u0027s just a proverbial phrase back on Helicon. If you ride a greti, you find you can\u0027t get off, for then it will eat you.\" Seldon paused. \"One more thing. Raych seems to be involved with a woman who knows Andorin and through whom, he thinks, he may get important information. I\u0027m telling you this now so that you won\u0027t accuse me afterward of keeping anything from you.\" Dors frowned. \"A woman?\" \"One, I gather, who knows a great many men who will talk to her unwisely, sometimes, under intimate circumstances.\" \"One of those.\" Her frown deepened. \"I don\u0027t like the thought of Raych-\" \"Come, come. Raych is thirty years old and undoubtedly has much experience. You can leave this woman-or any woman, I think-safely to Raych\u0027s good sense.\" He turned toward Dors with a look so worn, so weary, and said, \"Do you think I like this? Do you think I like any of this?\" And Dors could find nothing to say.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46661.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
