Actually you don\u0027t see anyone very often, do you?\" \\n\\n Amaryl said, \"I don\u0027t encourage people to visit me, no. They tend to interrupt me and break my line of thought. -Not you, Dors. You\u0027re altogether special, you and Hari. There\u0027s never a day I don\u0027t remember what you two have done for me.\" \\n\\n Dors waved her hand. \"Forget it, Yugo. You\u0027ve worked hard for Hari and any trifling kindness we did for you has long been overpaid. How is the Project going? Hari never talks about it-not to me, anyway.\" \\n\\n Amaryl\u0027s face lightened and his whole body seemed to take on an infusion of life. \"Very well. Very well. It\u0027s difficult to talk about it without mathematics, but the progress we\u0027ve made in the last two years is amazing-more than in all the time before that. It\u0027s as though, after we\u0027ve been hammering away and hammering away, things have finally begun to break loose.\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been hearing that the new equations worked out by Dr. Elar have helped the situation.\" \\n\\n \"The achaotic equations? Yes. Enormously.\" \\n\\n \"And the Electro-Clarifier has been helpful, too. I spoke to the woman who designed it.\" \\n\\n \"Cinda Monay?\" \\n\\n \"Yes. That\u0027s the one.\" \\n\\n \"A very clever woman. We\u0027re fortunate to have her.\" \\n\\n \"Tell me, Yugo- You work at the Prime Radiant virtually all the time, don\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027m more or less constantly studying it. Yes.\" \\n\\n \"And you study it with the Electro-Clarifier.\" \\n\\n \"Certainly.\" \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you ever think of taking a vacation, Yugo?\" \\n\\n Amaryl looked at her owlishly, blinking slowly. \"A vacation?\" \\n\\n \"Yes. Surely you\u0027ve heard the word. You know what a vacation is.\" \\n\\n \"Why should I take a vacation?\" \\n\\n \"Because you seem dreadfully tired to me.\" \\n\\n \"A little, now and then. But I don\u0027t want to leave the work.\" \\n\\n \"Do you feel more tired now than you used to?\" \\n\\n \"A little. I\u0027m getting older, Dors.\" \\n\\n \"You\u0027re only forty-nine.\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s still older than I\u0027ve ever been before.\" \\n\\n \"Well, let it go. Tell me, Yugo-just to change the subject. How is Hari doing at his work? You\u0027ve been with him so long that no one could possibly know him better than you do. Not even I. At least, as far as his work is concerned.\" \\n\\n \"He\u0027s doing very well, Dors. I see no change in him. He still has the quickest and brightest brain in the place. Age is having no effect on him -at least, not so far.\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s good to hear. I\u0027m afraid that his own opinion of himself is not as high as yours is. He\u0027s not taking his age well. We had a difficult time getting him to celebrate his recent birthday. Were you at the festivities, by the way? I didn\u0027t see you.\" \\n\\n \"I attended part of the time. But, you know, parties of that kind are not the sort of thing I feel at home with.\" \\n\\n \"Do you think Hari is wearing out? I\u0027m not referring to his mental brilliance. I\u0027m referring to his physical capacities. In your opinion, is he growing tired-too tired to bear up under his responsibilities?\" \\n\\n Amaryl looked astonished. \"I never gave it any thought. I can\u0027t imagine him growing tired.\" \\n\\n \"He may be, just the same. I think he has the impulse, now and then, to give up his post and hand the task over to some younger man.\" \\n\\n Amaryl sat back in his chair and put down the graphic stylus he had been fiddling with ever since Dors had entered. \"What! That\u0027s ridiculous! Impossible!\" \\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" \\n\\n \"Absolutely. He certainly wouldn\u0027t consider such a thing without discussing it with me. And he hasn\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \"Be reasonable, Yugo. Hari is exhausted. He tries not to show it, but he is. What if he does decide to retire? What would become of the Project? What would become of psychohistory?\" \\n\\n Amaryl\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Are you joking, Dors?\" \\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m just trying to look into the future.\" \\n\\n \"Surely, if Hari retires, I succeed to the post. He and I ran the Project for years before anyone else joined us. He and I. No one else. Except for him, no one knows the Project as I do. I\u0027m amazed you don\u0027t take my succession for granted, Dors.\" \\n\\n Dors said, \"There\u0027s no question in my mind or in anyone else\u0027s that you are the logical successor, but do you want to be? You may know everything about psychohistory, but do you want to throw yourself into the politics and complexities of a large Project and abandon much of your work in order to do so? Actually it\u0027s trying to keep everything moving smoothly that\u0027s been wearing Hari down. Can you take on that part of the job?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, I can and it\u0027s not something I intend to discuss. -Look here, Dors. Did you come here to break the news that Hari intends to ease me out?\" \\n\\n Dors said, \"Certainly not! How could you think that of Hari! Have you ever known him to turn on a friend?\" \\n\\n \"Very well, then. Let\u0027s drop the subject. Really, Dors, if you don\u0027t mind, there are things I must do.\" Abruptly he turned away from her and bent over his work once more. \\n\\n \"Of course. I didn\u0027t mean to take up this much of your time.\" \\n\\n Dors left, frowning. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46803.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
