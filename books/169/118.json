Nothing but interruptions. \"It wasn\u0027t anything important. Wanda\u0027s dream.\" Manella\u0027s lips pursed. \"I knew it. Wanda said Dors was asking her questions about it. Why doesn\u0027t she leave the girl alone? You would think that having a bad dream was some sort of felony.\" \"As a matter of fact,\" said Seldon soothingly, \"it\u0027s just a matter of something Wanda remembered as part of the dream. I don\u0027t know if Wanda told you, but apparently in her dream she heard something about \u0027lemonade death.\u0027 \" \"Hmm!\" Manella was silent for a moment. Then she said, \"That doesn\u0027t really matter so much. Wanda is crazy about lemonade and she\u0027s expecting lots of it at the party. I promised she\u0027d have some with Mycogenian drops in it and she\u0027s looking forward to it.\" \"So that if she heard something that sounded anything like lemonade, it would be translated into lemonade in her mind.\" \"Yes. Why not?\" \"Except that, in that case, what do you suppose it was that was actually said? She must have heard something in order to misinterpret it.\" \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessarily so. But why are we attaching so much importance to a little girl\u0027s dream? Please, I don\u0027t want anyone talking to her about it anymore. It\u0027s too upsetting.\" \"I agree. I\u0027ll see to it that Dors drops the subject-at least with Wanda.\" \"All right. I don\u0027t care if she is Wanda\u0027s grandmother, Hari. I\u0027m her mother, after all, and my wishes come first.\" \"Absolutely,\" said Seldon soothingly and looked after Manella as she left. That was another burden-the unending competition between those two women.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46733.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
