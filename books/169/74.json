{"id":4894,"no":74,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"Raych did his best to size up his new companion, without allowing his own face to lose its smooth naivete. The man had sharp greenish eyes and his right hand clenched almost threateningly into a fist as it rested on the table. \\n\\n Raych looked owlishly at the other and waited. \\n\\n Again, the man said, \"I understand you call yourself a Joranumite.\" \\n\\n Raych did his best to look uneasy. It was not difficult. He said, \"Why do you ask, mister?\" \\n\\n \"Because I don\u0027t think you\u0027re old enough.\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027m old enough. I used to watch Jo-Jo Joranum\u0027s speeches on holovision.\" \\n\\n \"Can you quote them?\" \\n\\n Raych shrugged. \"No, but I got the idea.\" \\n\\n \"You\u0027re a brave young man to talk openly about being a Joranumite. Some people don\u0027t like that.\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027m told there are lots of Joranumites in Wye.\" \\n\\n \"That may be. Is that why you came here?\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027m looking for a job. Maybe another Joranumite would help me.\" \\n\\n \"There are Joranumites in Dahl, too. Where are you from?\" \\n\\n There was no question that he recognized Raych\u0027s accent. That could not be disguised. \\n\\n He said, \"I was born in Millimaru, but I lived mostly in Dahl when I was growing up.\" \\n\\n \"Doing what?\" \\n\\n \"Nothing much. Going to school some.\" \\n\\n \"And why are you a Joranumite?\" \\n\\n Raych let himself heat up a bit. He couldn\u0027t have lived in downtrodden, discriminated-against Dahl without having obvious reasons for being a Joranumite. He said, \"Because I think there should be more representative government in the Empire, more participation by the people, and more equality among the sectors and the worlds. Doesn\u0027t anyone with brains and a heart think that?\" \\n\\n \"And you want to see the Emperorship abolished?\" \\n\\n Raych paused. One could get away with a great deal in the way of subversive statements, but anything overtly anti-Emperor was stepping outside the bounds. He said, \"I ain\u0027t saying that. I believe in the Emperor, but ruling a whole Empire is too much for one man.\" \\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t one man. There\u0027s a whole Imperial bureaucracy. What do you think of Hari Seldon, the First Minister?\" \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t think nothing about him. Don\u0027t know about him.\" \\n\\n \"All you know is that people should be more represented in the affairs of government. Is that right?\" \\n\\n Raych allowed himself to look confused. \"That\u0027s what Jo-Jo Joranum used to say. I don\u0027t know what you call it. I heard someone once call it `democracy,\u0027 but I don\u0027t know what that means.\" \\n\\n \"Democracy is something that some worlds have tried. Some still do. I don\u0027t know that those worlds are run better than other worlds. So you\u0027re a democrat?\" \\n\\n \"Is that what you call it?\" Raych let his head sink, as if in deep thought. \"I feel more at home as a Joranumite.\" \\n\\n \"Of course, as a Dahlite-\" \\n\\n \"I just lived there awhile.\" \\n\\n \"-you\u0027re all for people\u0027s equalities and such things. The Dahlites, being an oppressed group, would naturally think in that fashion.\" \\n\\n \"I hear that Wye is pretty strong in Joranumite thinking. They\u0027re not oppressed.\" \\n\\n \"Different reason. The old Wye Mayors always wanted to be Emperors. Did you know that?\" \\n\\n Raych shook his head. \\n\\n \"Eighteen years ago,\" said the man, \"Mayor Rashelle nearly carried through a coup in that direction. So the Wyans are rebels, not so much Joranumite as anti-Cleon.\" \\n\\n Raych said, \"I don\u0027t know nothing about that. I ain\u0027t against the Emperor.\" \\n\\n \"But you are for popular representation, aren\u0027t you? Do you think that some sort of elected assembly could run the Galactic Empire without bogging down in politics and partisan bickering? Without paralysis?\" \\n\\n Raych said, \"Huh? I don\u0027t understand.\" \\n\\n \"Do you think a great many people could come to some decision quickly in times of emergency? Or would they just sit around and argue?\" \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, but it doesn\u0027t seem right that just a few people should have all the say over all the worlds.\" \\n\\n \"Are you willing to fight for your beliefs? Or do you just like to talk about them?\" \\n\\n \"No one asked me to do any fighting,\" said Raych. \\n\\n \"Suppose someone did. How important do you think your beliefs about democracy-or Joranumite philosophy-are?\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027d fight for them-if I thought it would do any good.\" \\n\\n \"There\u0027s a brave lad. So you came to Wye to fight for your beliefs.\" \\n\\n \"No,\" said Raych uncomfortably, \"I can\u0027t say I did. I came to look for a job, sir. It ain\u0027t easy to find no jobs these days-and I ain\u0027t got no credits. A guy\u0027s gotta live.\" \\n\\n \"I agree. What\u0027s your name?\" \\n\\n The question shot out without warning, but Raych was ready for it. \"Planchet, sir.\" \\n\\n \"First or last name?\" \\n\\n \"Only name, as far as I know.\" \\n\\n \"You have no credits and, I gather, very little education.\" \\n\\n \"Afraid so.\" \\n\\n \"And no experience at any specialized job?\" \\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t worked much, but I\u0027m willing.\" \\n\\n \"All right. I\u0027ll tell you what, Planchet.\" He took a small white triangle out of his pocket and pressed it in such a way as to produce a printed message on it. Then he rubbed his thumb across it, freezing it. \"I\u0027ll tell you where to go. You take this with you and it may get you a job.\" \\n\\n Raych took the card and glanced at it. The signals seemed to fluoresce, but Raych could not read them. He looked at the other man warily. \"What if they think I stole it?\" \\n\\n \"It can\u0027t be stolen. It has my sign on it and now it has your name.\" \\n\\n \"What if they ask me who you are?\" \\n\\n \"They won\u0027t. -You say you want a job. There\u0027s your chance. I don\u0027t guarantee it, but there\u0027s your chance.\" He gave him another card. \"This is where to go.\" Raych could read this one. \\n\\n \"Thank you,\" he mumbled. \\n\\n The man made little dismissing gestures with his hand. \\n\\n Raych rose and left-and wondered what he was getting into. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46655.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
