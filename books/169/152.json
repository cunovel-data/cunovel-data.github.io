{"id":4972,"no":152,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"Hari Seldon knocked gently with an old-fashioned code and Yugo Amaryl looked up. \"Hari, how nice of you to drop around.\" \n \"I should do it more often. In the old days we were together all the time. Now there are hundreds of people to worry about-here, there, and everywhere-and they get between us. Have you heard the news?\" \n \"What news?\" \n \"The junta is going to set up a poll tax-a nice substantial one. It will be announced on TrantorVision tomorrow. It will be just Trantor for now and the Outer Worlds will have to wait. That\u0027s a little disappointing. I had hoped it would be Empire-wide all at once, but apparently I didn\u0027t give the General enough credit for caution.\" \n Amaryl said, \"Trantor will be enough. The Outer Worlds will know that their turn will follow in not too long a time.\" \n \"Now we\u0027ll have to see what happens.\" \n \"What will happen is that the shouting will start the instant the announcement is out and the riots will begin, even before the new tax goes into effect.\" \n \"Are you sure of it?\" \n Amaryl put his Prime Radiant into action at once and expanded the appropriate section. \"See for yourself, Hari. I don\u0027t see how that can be misinterpreted and that\u0027s the prediction under the particular circumstances that now exist. If it doesn\u0027t happen, it means that everything we\u0027ve worked out in psychohistory is wrong and I refuse to believe that.\" \n \"I\u0027ll try to have courage,\" said Seldon, smiling. Then \"How do you feel lately, Yugo?\" \n \"Well enough. Reasonably well. -And how are you, by the way? I\u0027ve heard rumors that you\u0027re thinking of resigning. Even Dors said something about that.\" \n \"Pay no attention to Dors. These days she\u0027s saying all sorts of things. \n She has a bug in her head about some sort of danger permeating the Project.\" \n \"What kind of danger?\" \n \"It\u0027s better not to ask. She\u0027s just gone off on one of her tangents and, as always, that makes her uncontrollable.\" \n Amaryl said, \"See the advantage I have in being single?\" Then, in a lower voice, \"If you do resign, Hari, what are your plans for the future?\" \n Seldon said, \"You\u0027ll take over. What other plans can I possibly have?\" \n And Amaryl smiled. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46809.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
