It\u0027s been over a month mow.\" \n Dr. Endelecki nodded. \"I\u0027m sorry, Professor Seldon but you wanted everything exact and that is what I have tried to do.\" \n \"Well?\" The look of anxiety on Seldon\u0027s face did not disappear. What did you find?\" \n \"A hundred or so defective genes.\" \n \"What! Defective genes. Are you serious, Doctor?\" \n \"Quite serious. Why not? There are no genomes without at least a hundred defective genes; usually there are considerably more. It\u0027s not as bad as it sounds, you know.\" \n \"No, I don\u0027t know. You\u0027re the expert, Doctor, not I.\" \n Dr. Endelecki sighed and stirred in her chair. \"You don\u0027t know anything about genetics, do you, Professor?\" \n \"No, I don\u0027t. A man can\u0027t know everything.\" \n \"You\u0027re perfectly right. I know nothing about this-what do you call it?-this psychohistory of yours.\" \n Dr. Endelecki shrugged, then continued. \"If you wanted to explain anything about it, you would be forced to start from the beginning and I would probably not understand it even so. \"Now, as to genetics-\" \n \"Well?\" \n \"An imperfect gene usually means nothing. There are imperfect genes-so imperfect and so crucial that they produce terrible disorders. These are very rare, though. Most imperfect genes simply don\u0027t work with absolute accuracy. They\u0027re like wheels that are slightly out of balance. A vehicle will move along, trembling a bit, but it will move along.\" \n \"Is that what Wanda has?\" \n \"Yes. More or less. After all, if all genes were perfect, we would all look precisely the same, we would all behave precisely the same. It\u0027s the difference in genes that makes for different people.\" \n \"But won\u0027t it get worse as we grow older?\" \n \"Yes. We all get worse as we grow older. I noticed you limping when you came in. Why is that?\" \n \"A touch of sciatica,\" muttered Seldon. \n \"Did you have it all your life?\" \n \"Of course not.\" \n \"Well, some of your genes have gotten worse with time and now you limp.\" \n \"And what will happen to Wanda with time?\" \n \"I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t predict the future, Professor; I believe that is your province. However, if I were to hazard a guess, I would say that nothing unusual will happen to Wanda-at least, genetically-except the gathering of old age.\" \n Seldon said, \"Are you sure?\" \n \"You have to take my word for it. You wanted to find out about Wanda\u0027s genome and you ran the risk of discovering things perhaps it is better not to know. But I tell you that, in my opinion, I can see nothing terrible happening to her.\" \n \"The imperfect genes-should we fix them? Can we fix them?\" \n \"No. In the first place, it would be very expensive. Secondly, the chances are that they would not stay fixed. And finally, people are against it. \n \"But why?\" \n \"Because they\u0027re against science in general. You should know this as well as anyone, Professor. I\u0027m afraid the situation is such, especially since Cleon\u0027s death, that mysticism has been gaining ground. People don\u0027t believe in fixing genes scientifically. They would rather cure things by the laying on of hands or by mumbo-jumbo of some sort or other. Frankly it is extremely difficult for me to continue with my job. Very little funding is coming in.\" \n Seldon nodded. \"Actually I understand this situation all too well. Psychohistory explains it, but I honestly didn\u0027t think the situation was growing so bad so rapidly. I\u0027ve been too involved in my own work to see the difficulties all around me.\" He sighed. \"I\u0027ve been watching the Galactic Empire slowly fall apart for over thirty years now-and now that it\u0027s beginning to collapse much more rapidly, I don\u0027t see how we can stop it in time.\" \n \"Are you trying to?\" Dr. Endelecki seemed amused. \n \"Yes, I am.\" \n \"Lots of luck. -About your sciatica. You know, fifty years ago it could have been cured. Not now, though.\" \n \"Why not?\" \n \"Well, the devices used for it are gone; the people who could have handled them are working on other things. Medicine is declining.\" \n \"Along with everything else,\" mused Seldon. \"-But let\u0027s get back to Wanda. I feel she is a most unusual young woman with a brain that is different from most. What do her genes tell you about her brain?\" \n Dr. Endelecki leaned back in her chair. \"Professor Seldon do you know just how many genes are involved in brain function?\" \n \"No. \n \"I\u0027ll remind you that, of all the aspects of the human body, the brain Junction is the most intricate. In fact, as far as we know, there is nothing m the Universe as intricate as the human brain. So you won\u0027t be surprised when I tell you that there are thousands of genes that each play a i0ale in brain function.\" \n \"Thousands?\" \n \"Exactly. And it is impossible to go through those genes and see anything specifically unusual. I will take your word for it, as far as Wanda is concerned. She is an unusual girl with an unusual brain, but I see nothing in her genes that can tell me anything about that brain-except, of course, that it is normal.\" \n \"Could you find other people whose genes for mental functioning are like Wanda\u0027s, that have the same brain pattern?\" \n \"I doubt it very much. Even if another brain were much like hers, there would still be enormous differences in the genes. No use looking for similarities. -Tell me, Professor, just what is it about Wanda that makes you think her brain is so unusual?\" \n Seldon shook his head. \"I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s not something I can discuss.\" \n \"In that case, I am certain that I can find out nothing for you. How did you discover that there was something unusual about her brain-this thing you can\u0027t discuss?\" \n \"Accident,\" muttered Seldon. \"Sheer accident.\" \n \"In that case, you\u0027re going to have to find other brains like hers-also by accident. Nothing else can be done.\" \n Silence settled over both of them. Finally Seldon said, \"Is there anything else you can tell me?\" \n \"I\u0027m afraid not. Except that I\u0027ll send you my bill.\" \n Seldon rose with an effort. His sciatica hurt him badly. \"Well then, thank you, Doctor. Send the bill and I\u0027ll pay it.\" \n Hari Seldon left the doctor\u0027s office, wondering just what he would do next. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46829.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
