{"id":5022,"no":202,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"\"Mr. Bindris,\" said Hari Seldon, reaching out his hand to shake the other\u0027s. \"I am so glad to be able to see you. It was good of you to agree to see me.\" \"Why not?\" said Terep Bindris jovially. \"I know you well. Or, rather, I know of you well.\" \"That\u0027s pleasant. I take it you\u0027ve heard of psychohistory, then.\" \"Oh yes, what intelligent person hasn\u0027t? Not that I understand anything about it, of course. And who is this young lady you have with you?\" \"My granddaughter, Wanda.\" \"A very pretty young woman.\" He beamed. \"Somehow I feel I\u0027d be putty in her hands.\" Wanda said, \"I think you exaggerate, sir.\" \"No, really. Now, please, sit down and tell me what it is I can do for you.\" He gestured expansively with his arm, indicating that they be seated on two overstuffed, richly brocaded chairs in front of the desk at which he sat. The chairs, like the ornate desk, the imposing carved doors which had slid back noiselessly at their arrival signal, and the gleaming obsidian floor of Bindris\u0027s vast office, were of the finest quality. And, although his surroundings were impressive-and imposing-Bindris himself was not. The slight cordial man would not be taken, at first glance, for one of Trantor\u0027s leading financial powerbrokers. \"We\u0027re here, sir, at the Emperor\u0027s suggestion.\" \"The Emperor?\" \"Yes, he could not help us, but he thought a man like you might be able to do so. The question, of course, is credits.\" Bindris\u0027s face fell. \"Credits?\" he said. \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"Well,\" said Seldon, \"for nearly forty years, psychohistory has been supported by the government. However, times change and the Empire is no longer what it was.\" \"Yes, I know that.\"\u0027 \"The Emperor lacks the credits to support us or, even if he did have the credits, he couldn\u0027t get the request for funding past the Legislature. He recommends, therefore, that I see businesspeople who, in the first place, still have credits and, in the second place, can simply write out a credit voucher.\" There was a longish pause and Bindris finally said, \"The Emperor, I\u0027m afraid, knows nothing about business. -How many credits do you want?\" \"Mr. Bindris, we\u0027re talking about an enormous task. I\u0027m going to need several million.\" \"Several million!\" \"Yes, sir.\" Bindris frowned. \"Are we talking about a loan here? When do you expect to be able to pay it back?\" \"Well, Mr. Bindris, I can\u0027t honestly say I ever expect to be able to pay it back. I\u0027m looking for a gift.\" \"Even if I wanted to give you the credits-and let me tell you, for some strange reason I very much want to do so-I couldn\u0027t. The Emperor may have his Legislature, but I have my Board members. I can\u0027t make a gift of that sort without the Board\u0027s permission and they\u0027ll never grant it.\" \"Why not? Your firm is enormously wealthy. A few million would mean nothing to you.\" \"That sounds good,\" said Bindris, \"but I\u0027m afraid that the firm is in a state of decline right now. Not sufficiently to bring us into serious trouble, but enough to make us unhappy. If the Empire is in a state of decay, different individual parts of it are decaying, too. We are in no position to Land out a few million. -I\u0027m truly sorry.\" Seldon sat there silently and Bindris seemed unhappy. He shook his Head at last and said, \"Look, Professor Seldon, I would really like to help you out, particularly for the sake of the young lady you have with you. It just can\u0027t be done. -However, we\u0027re not the only firm in Trantor. Try others, Professor. You may have better luck elsewhere.\" \"Well,\" said Seldon, raising himself to his feet with an effort, \"we shall try.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46930.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
