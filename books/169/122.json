Looking up finally, he said, \"What was his excuse?\" \\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t he. Some of our mathematicians arranged a week\u0027s postponement so that it wouldn\u0027t interfere with the birthday celebration. I find all of this to be extremely annoying.\" \\n\\n \"Why did you let them do that?\" \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t. They just went ahead and arranged things.\" Seldon shrugged. \"In a way, it\u0027s my fault. I\u0027ve whined so long about turning sixty that everyone thinks they have to cheer me up with festivities.\" \\n\\n Amaryl said, \"Of course, we can use the week.\" \\n\\n Seldon sat forward, immediately tense. \"Is something wrong?\" \\n\\n \"No. Not that I can see, but it won\u0027t hurt to examine it further. Look, Hari, this is the first time in nearly thirty years that psychohistory has leached the point where it can actually make a prediction. It\u0027s not much of one-it\u0027s just a small pinch of the vast continent of humanity-but it\u0027s t lie best we\u0027ve had so far. All right. We want to take advantage of that, see how it works, prove to ourselves that psychohistory is what we think it is: a predictive science. So it won\u0027t hurt to make sure that we haven\u0027t overlooked anything. Even this tiny bit of prediction is complex and I welcome another week of study.\" \\n\\n \"Very well, then. I\u0027ll consult you on the matter before I go to see the General for any last-minute modifications that have to be made. Meanwhile, Yugo, do not allow any information concerning this to leak out to the others-not to anyone. If it fails, I don\u0027t want the people of the Project to grow downhearted. You and I will absorb the failure ourselves and keep on trying.\" \\n\\n A rare wistful smile crossed Amaryl\u0027s face. \"You and I. Do you remember when it really was just the two of us?\" \\n\\n \"I remember it very well and don\u0027t think that I don\u0027t miss those days. We didn\u0027t have much to work with-\" \\n\\n \"Not even the Prime Radiant, let alone the Electro-Clarifier.\" \\n\\n \"But those were happy days.\" \\n\\n \"Happy,\" said Amaryl, nodding his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46737.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
