{"id":4920,"no":100,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"A blaster, despite its name, does not \"blast\" in the proper sense of the term. It vaporizes and blows out an interior and-if anything-causes an implosion. There is a soft sighing sound, leaving what appears to be a \"blasted\" object. \\n\\n Hari Seldon did not expect to hear that sound. He expected only death. It was, therefore, with surprise that he heard the distinctive soft sighing sound and he blinked rapidly as he looked down at himself, slackjawed. \\n\\n He was alive? (He thought it as a question, not a statement.) \\n\\n Raych was still standing there, his blaster pointing forward, his eyes glazed. He was absolutely motionless, as though some motive power had ceased. \\n\\n Behind him was the crumpled body of Andorin, fallen in a pool of blood, and standing next to him, blaster in hand, was a gardener. The hood had slipped away; the gardener was clearly a woman with freshly clipped hair. \\n\\n She allowed herself a glance at Seldon and said, \"Your son knows me as Manella Dubanqua. I\u0027m a security officer. Do you want my reference number, First Minister?\" \\n\\n \"No,\" said Seldon faintly. Imperial Guard had converged on the scene. \"My son! What\u0027s wrong with my son?\" \\n\\n \"Desperance, I think,\" said Manella. \"That can be washed out eventually.\" She reached forward to take the blaster out of Raych\u0027s hand. \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t act sooner. I had to wait for an overt move and, when it came, it almost caught me napping.\" \\n\\n \"I had the same trouble. We must take Raych to the Palace hospital.\" \\n\\n A confused noise suddenly emanated from the Small Palace. It occurred to Seldon that the Emperor was, indeed, watching the proceedings and, if so, he must be grandly furious, indeed. \\n\\n \"Take care of my son, Miss Dubanqua,\" said Seldon. \"I must see the Emperor.\" \\n\\n He set off at an undignified run through the chaos on the Great Lawns and dashed into the Small Palace without ceremony. Cleon could scarcely grow any angrier over that. \\n\\n And there, with an appalled group watching in stupor-there, on the semicircular stairway-was the body of His Imperial Majesty, Cleon I, smashed all but beyond recognition. His rich Imperial robes now served as a shroud. Cowering against the wall, staring stupidly at the horrified faces surrounding him, was Mandell Gruber. \\n\\n Seldon felt he could take no more. He took in the blaster lying at Gruber\u0027s feet. It had been Andorin\u0027s, he was sure. He asked softly, \"Gruber, what have you done?\" \\n\\n Gruber, staring at him, babbled, \"Everyone screaming and yelling. I thought, Who would know? They would think someone else had killed the Emperor. But then I couldn\u0027t run.\" \\n\\n \"But, Gruber. Why?\" \\n\\n \"So I wouldn\u0027t have to be Chief Gardener.\" And he collapsed. \\n\\n Seldon stared in shock at the unconscious Gruber. \\n\\n Everything had worked out by the narrowest of margins. He himself was alive. Raych was alive. Andorin was dead and the Joranumite Conspiracy would now be hunted down to the last person. \\n\\n The center would have held, just as psychohistory had dictated. \\n\\n And then one man, for a reason so trivial as to defy analysis, had killed the Emperor. \\n\\n And now, thought Seldon in despair, what do we do? What happens next? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46715.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
