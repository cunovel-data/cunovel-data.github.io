{"id":4958,"no":138,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"Seldon had had a bad night also, nor was the new day promising to be much better. There weren\u0027t too many times when Hari felt annoyed with Dors. But this time, he was very annoyed. He said, \"What a foolish thing to do! Wasn\u0027t it enough that we were all staying at the Dome\u0027s Edge Hotel? That alone would have been sufficient to drive a paranoid ruler into thoughts of some sort of conspiracy.\" \"How? We were unarmed, Hari. It was a holiday affair, the final touch of your birthday celebration. We posed no threat.\" \"Yes, but then you carried out your invasion of the Palace grounds. It was unforgivable. You raced to the Palace to interfere with my session with the General, when I had specifically-and several times-made it plain that I didn\u0027t want you there. I had my own plans, you know.\" Dors said, \"Your desires and your orders and your plans all take second place to your safety. I was primarily concerned about that.\" \"I was in no danger.\" \"That is not something I can carelessly assume. There have been two attempts on your life. What makes you think there won\u0027t be a third?\" \"The two attempts were made when I was First Minister. I was probably worth killing then. Who would want to kill an elderly mathematician?\" Dors said, \"That\u0027s exactly what I want to find out and that\u0027s what I want to stop. I must begin by doing some questioning right here at the Project.\" \"No. You will simply be upsetting my people. Leave them alone.\" \"That\u0027s exactly what I can\u0027t do. Hari, my job is to protect you and for twenty-eight years I\u0027ve been working at that. You cannot stop me now.\" Something in the blaze of her eyes made it quite clear that, whatever Seldon\u0027s desires or orders might be, Dors intended to do as she pleased. Seldon\u0027s safety came first.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46795.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
