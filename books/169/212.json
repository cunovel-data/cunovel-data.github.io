{"id":5032,"no":212,"title":"Chapter 27","content":"It was a lovely day, neither too warm nor too cold, not too bright nor too gray. Even though the groundskeeping budget had given out years ago, the few straggly perennials lining the steps leading up to the Galactic Library managed to add a cheerful note to the morning. (The Library, having been built in the classical style of antiquity, was fronted with one of the grandest stairways to be found in the entire Empire, second only to the steps at the Imperial Palace itself. Most Library visitors, however, preferred to enter via the gliderail) Seldon had high hopes for the day. \n Since he and Stettin Palver had been cleared of all charges in their recent assault and battery case, Hari Seldon felt like a new man. Although the experience had been painful, its very public nature had advanced Seldon\u0027s cause. Judge Tejan Popjens Lih, who was considered one of, if not the most influential judge on Trantor, had been quite vociferous in her opinion, delivered the day following Rial Nevas\u0027s emotional testimony. \n \"When we come to such a crossroads in our `civilized\u0027 society,\" the judge intoned from her bench, \"that a man of Professor Hari Seldon\u0027s standing is made to bear the humiliation, abuse, and lies of his peers simply because of who he is and what he stands for, it is truly a dark day for the Empire. I admit that I, too, was taken in-at first. `Why wouldn\u0027t Professor Seldon,\u0027 I reasoned, `resort to such trickery in an attempt to prove his predictions?\u0027 But, as I came to see, I was most grievously wrong.\" Here the judge\u0027s brow furrowed, a dark blue flush began creeping up her neck and into her cheeks. \"For I was ascribing to Professor Seldon motives born of our new society, a society in which honesty, decency, and goodwill are likely to get one killed, a society in which it appears one must resort to dishonesty and trickery merely to survive. \n \"How far we have strayed from our founding principles. We were lucky this time, fellow citizens of Trantor. We owe a debt of thanks to Professor Hari Seldon for showing us our true selves; let us take his example to heart and resolve to be vigilant against the baser forces of our human nature.\" \n Following the hearing, the Emperor had sent Seldon a congratulatory bolo-disc. On it he expressed the hope that perhaps now Seldon would find renewed funding for his Project. \n As Seldon slid up the entrance gliderail, he reflected on the current status of his Psychohistory Project. His good friend-the former Chief Librarian Las Zenow-had retired. During his tenure, Zenow had been a strong proponent of Seldon and his work. More often than not, however, Zenow\u0027s hands had been tied by the Library Board. But, he had assured Seldon, the affable new Chief Librarian, Tryma Acarnio, was as progressive as he himself, and was popular with many factions among the Board membership. \n \"Hari, my friend,\" Zenow had said before leaving Trantor for his home world of Wencory, \"Acarnio is a good man, a person of deep intellect and an open mind. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll do all that he can to help you and the Project. I\u0027ve left him the entire data file on you and your EncyIopedia; I know he\u0027ll be as excited as I about the contribution to humanity it represents. Take care, my friend-I\u0027ll remember you fondly.\" \n And so today Hari Seldon was to have his first official meeting with the new Chief Librarian. He was cheered by the reassurances Las Zenow had left with him and he was looking forward to sharing his plans for the future of the Project and the Encyclopedia. \n Tryma Acarnio stood as Hari entered the Chief Librarian\u0027s office. \n Already he had made his mark on the place; whereas Zenow had stuffed every nook and cranny of the room with holo-discs and tridijournals from the different sectors of Trantor, and a dizzying array of visiglobes representing various worlds of the Empire had spun in midair, Acarnio had swept clear the mounds of data and images that Zenow had liked to keep at his fingertips. A large holoscreen now dominated one wall on which, Seldon presumed, Acarnio could view any publication or broadcast that he desired. \n Acarnio was short and stocky, with a slightly distracted look-from a childhood corneal correction that had gone awry-that belied a fearsome intelligence and constant awareness of everything going on around him at all times. \n \"Well, well. Professor Seldon. Come in. Sit down.\" Acarnio gestured to a straight-backed chair facing the desk at which he sat. \"It was, I felt, quite fortuitous that you requested this meeting. You see, I had intended to get in touch with you as soon as I settled in.\" \n Seldon nodded, pleased that the new Chief Librarian had considered him enough of a priority to plan to seek him out in the hectic early days of his tenure. \n \"But, first, Professor, please let me know why you wanted to see me before we move on to my, most likely, more prosaic concerns.\" \n Seldon cleared his throat and leaned forward. \"Chief Librarian, Las Zenow has no doubt told you of my work here and of my idea for an Encyclopedia Galactica. Las was quite enthusiastic, and a great help, providing a private office for me here and unlimited access to the Library\u0027s vast resources. In fact, it was he who located the eventual home of the Encyclopedia Project, a remote Outer World called Terminus. \n \"There was one thing, however, that Las could not provide. In order to keep the Project on schedule, I must have office space and unlimited access granted to a number of my colleagues, as well. It is an enormous undertaking, just gathering the information to be copied and transferred to Terminus before we can begin the actual work of compiling the Encyclopedia. \n \"Las was not popular with the Library Board, as you undoubtedly are aware. You, however, are. And so I ask you, Chief Librarian: Will you see to it that my colleagues are granted insiders\u0027 privileges so that we may continue our most vital work?\" \n Here Hari stopped, almost out of breath. He was sure that his speech, which he had gone over and over in his mind the night before, would have the desired effect. He waited, confident in Acarnio\u0027s response. \n \"Professor Seldon,\" Acarnio began. Seldon\u0027s expectant smile faded. There was an edge to the Chief Librarian\u0027s voice that Seldon had not expected. \"My esteemed predecessor provided me-in exhaustive detail -an explication of your work here at the Library. He was quite enthusiastic about your research and committed to the idea of your colleagues joining you here. As was I, Professor Seldon\"-at Acarnio\u0027s pause, Seldon looked up sharply-\"at first. I was prepared to call a special meeting of the Board to propose that a larger suite of offices be prepared for you and your Encyclopedists. But, Professor Seldon, all that has now changed.\" \n \"Changed! But why?\" \n \"Professor Seldon, you have just finished serving as principal defendant in a most sensational assault and battery case.\" \n \"But I was acquitted,\" Seldon broke in. \"The case never even made it to trial.\" \n \"Nonetheless, Professor, your latest foray into the public eye has given you an undeniable-how shall I say it?-tinge of ill repute. Oh yes, you were acquitted of all charges. But in order to get to that acquittal, your name, your past, your beliefs, and your work were paraded before the eyes of all the worlds. And even if one progressive right-thinking judge has proclaimed you faultless, what of the millions-perhaps billions-of other average citizens who see not a pioneering psychohistorian striving to preserve his civilization\u0027s glory but a raving lunatic shouting doom and gloom for the great and mighty Empire? \n \"You, by the very nature of your work, are threatening the essential fabric of the Empire. I don\u0027t mean the huge, nameless, faceless, monolithic Empire. No, I am referring to the heart and soul of the Empire-its people. When you tell them the Empire is failing, you are saying that they are failing. And this, my dear Professor, the average citizen cannot face. \n \"Seldon, like it or not, you have become an object of derision, a subject of ridicule, a laughingstock.\" \n \"Pardon me, Chief Librarian, but for years now I have been, to some circles, a laughingstock.\" \n \"Yes, but only to some circles. But this latest incident-and the very public forum in which it was played out-has opened you up to ridicule not only here on Trantor but throughout the worlds. And, Professor, if, by providing you an office, we, the Galactic Library, give tacit approval to your work, then, by inference, we, the Library, also become a laughingstock throughout the worlds. And no matter how strongly I may personally believe in your theory and your Encyclopedia, as Chief Librarian of the Galactic Library on Trantor, I must think of the Library first. \n \"And so, Professor Seldon, your request to bring in your colleagues is denied.\" \n Hari Seldon jerked back in his chair as if struck. \n \"Further,\" Acarnio continued, \"I must advise you of a two-week temporary suspension of all Library privileges-effective immediately. The Board has called that special meeting, Professor Seldon. In two weeks\u0027 time we will notify you whether or not we\u0027ve decided that our association with you must be terminated.\" \n Here, Acarnio stopped speaking and, placing his palms on the glossy, spotless surface of his desk, stood up. \"That is all, Professor Seldon-for now.\" \n Hari Seldon stood as well, although his upward movement was not as smooth, nor as quick, as Tryma Acarnio抯.. \n \"May I be permitted to address the Board?\" asked Seldon. \"Perhaps if I were able to explain to them the vital importance of psychohistory and the Encyclopedia-\" \n \"I\u0027m afraid not, Professor,\" said Acarnio softly and Seldon caught a brief glimmer of the man Las Zenow had told him about. But, just as quickly, the icy bureaucrat was back as Acarnio guided Seldon to the door. \n As the portals slid open, Acarnio said, \"Two weeks, Professor Seldon. Till then.\" Hari stepped through to his waiting skitter and the doors slid shut. \n What am I going to do now? wondered Seldon disconsolately. Is this the end of my work? \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46940.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
