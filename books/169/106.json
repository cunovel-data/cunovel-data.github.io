{"id":4926,"no":106,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"Seldon said, \"Wherever do you think Wanda got such a notion?\" \"Come now, Hari. She had a Salvanian gecko that died, remember? One of her friends had a father who died in an accident and she sees deaths on holovision all the time. It is impossible for any child to be so protected as not to be aware of death. Actually I wouldn\u0027t want her to be so protected. Death is an essential part of life; she must learn that.\" \"I don\u0027t mean death in general, Manella. I mean my death in particular. What has put that into her head?\" Manella hesitated. She was very fond, indeed, of Hari Seldon. She thought, Who would not be, so how can I say this? But how could she not say this? So she said, \"Hari, you yourself put it into her head.\" \"I?\" \"Of course, you\u0027ve been speaking for months of turning sixty and complaining loudly of growing old. The only reason people are setting up this party is to console you.\" \"It\u0027s no fun turning sixty,\" said Seldon indignantly. \"Wait! Wait! You\u0027ll find out.\" \"I will-if I\u0027m lucky. Some people don\u0027t make it to sixty. Just the same, if turning sixty and being old are all you talk about, you end up frightening an impressionable little girl.\" Seldon sighed and looked troubled. \"I\u0027m sorry, but it\u0027s hard. Look at my hands. They\u0027re getting spotted and soon they\u0027ll be gnarled. I can do hardly anything in the way of Twisting any longer. A child could probably force me to my knees.\" \"In what way does that make you different from other sixty-year-olds? At least your brain is working as well as ever. How often have you said that that\u0027s all that counts?\" \"I know. But I miss my body.\" Manella said with just a touch of malice, \"Especially when Dors doesn\u0027t seem to get any older.\" Seldon said uneasily, \"Well yes, I suppose-\" He looked away, clearly unwilling to talk about the matter. Manella looked at her father-in-law gravely. The trouble was, he knew nothing about children-or about people generally. It was hard to think that he had spent ten years as First Minister under the old Emperor and yet ended up knowing as little about people as he did. Of course, he was entirely wrapped up in this psychohistory of his, that dealt with quadrillions of people, which ultimately meant dealing with no people at all-as individuals. And how could he know about children when he had had no contact with any child except Raych, who had entered his life as a twelve-year-old? Now he had Wanda, who was-and would probably remain to him-an utter mystery. Manella thought all this lovingly. She had the incredible desire to protect Hari Seldon from a world he did not understand. It was the only point at which she and her mother-in-law, Dors Venabili, met and coalesced-this desire to protect Hari Seldon. Manella had saved Seldon\u0027s life ten years before. Dors, in her strange way, had considered this an invasion of her prerogative and had never quite forgiven Manella. Seldon, in his turn, had then saved Manella\u0027s life. She closed her eyes briefly and the whole scene returned to her, almost as though it were happening to her right now.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46721.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
