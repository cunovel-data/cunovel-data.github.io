There are quite unbelievable tales of her strength and speed and she was widely spoken of, or perhaps whispered of, as \"The Tiger Woman.\" Still more puzzling than her coming, however, is her going, for after a certain time, we hear of her no more and there is no indication as to what happened. \n Her role as a historian is evidenced by her works on- \n ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA \n \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46717.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
