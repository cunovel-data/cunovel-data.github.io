{"id":4892,"no":72,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"In some respects, Wye could be quite puritanical. (This was true of all the sectors, though the rigidity of one sector might be completely different from the rigidity of another.) Here, the drinks were not alcoholic but were synthetically designed to stimulate in other ways. Raych did not like the taste, finding himself utterly unused to it, but it meant that he could sip his drink slowly and look around. He caught the eye of a young woman several tables away and had difficulty in looking away. She was attractive and it was clear that Wye\u0027s ways were not puritanical in every fashion. After a few moments, the young woman smiled slightly and rose. She drifted toward Raych\u0027s table, while Raych watched her speculatively. He could scarcely (he thought with marked regret) afford a side adventure just now. She stopped for a moment when she reached Raych and then let herself slide smoothly into an adjacent chair. \"Hello,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t look like a regular here.\" Raych smiled. \"I\u0027m not. Do you know all the regulars?\" \"Just about,\" she said, unembarrassed. \"My name is Manella. What\u0027s yours?\" Raych was more regretful than ever. She was quite tall, taller than he himself was without his heels-something he always found attractive-had a milky complexion, and long, softly wavy hair that had distinct glints of dark red in it. Her clothing was not too garish and she might, if she had tried a little harder, have passed as a respectable woman of the not-too-hardworking class. Raych said, \"My name doesn\u0027t matter. I don\u0027t have many credits.\" \"Oh. Too bad.\" Manella made a face. \"Can\u0027t you get a few?\" \"I\u0027d like to. I need a job. Do you know of any?\" \"What kind of job?\" Raych shrugged. \"I don\u0027t have any experience in anything fancy, but I ain\u0027t proud.\" Manella looked at him thoughtfully. \"I\u0027ll tell you what, Mr. Nameless. Sometimes it doesn\u0027t take any credits at all.\" Raych froze at once. He had been successful enough with women, but with his mustache-his mustache. What could she see in his baby face? He said, \"Tell you what. I had a friend living here a couple of weeks ago and I can\u0027t find him. Since you know all the regulars, maybe you know him. His name is Kaspalov.\" He raised his voice slightly. \"Kaspal Kaspalov.\" Manella stared at him blankly and shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know anybody by that name.\" \"Too bad. He was a Joranumite and so am L\" Again, a blank look. \"Do you know what a Joranumite is?\" She shook her head. \"N-no. I\u0027ve heard the word, but I don\u0027t know what it means. Is it some kind of job?\" Raych felt disappointed. He said, \"It would take too long to explain.\" It sounded like a dismissal and, after a moment of uncertainty, Manella rose and drifted away. She did not smile and Raych was a little surprised that she had remained as long as she did. (Well, Seldon had always insisted that Raych had the capacity to inspire affection-but surely not in a businesswoman of this sort. For them, payment was the thing.) His eyes followed Manella automatically as she stopped at another table, where a man was seated by himself. He was of early middle age, with butter-yellow hair, slicked back. He was very smooth-shaven, but it seemed to Raych that he could have used a beard, his chin being too prominent and a bit asymmetric. Apparently Manella had no better luck with this beardless one. A few words were exchanged and she moved on. Too bad, but surely it was impossible for her to fail often. She was unquestionably desirable. Raych found himself thinking, quite involuntarily, of what the upshot would be if he, after all, could- And then Raych realized that he had been joined by someone else. It was a man this time. It was, in fact, the man to whom Manella had just spoken. He was astonished that his own preoccupation had allowed him to be thus approached and, in effect, caught by surprise. He couldn\u0027t very well afford this sort of thing. The man looked at him with a glint of curiosity in his eyes. \"You were just talking to a friend of mine.\" Raych could not help smiling broadly. \"She\u0027s a friendly person.\" \"Yes, she is. And a good friend of mine. I couldn\u0027t help overhearing what you said to her.\" \"Wasn\u0027t nothing wrong, I think.\" \"Not at all, but you called yourself a Joranumite.\" Raych\u0027s heart jumped. His remark to Manella had hit dead-center after all. It had meant nothing to her, but it seemed to mean something to her \"friend.\" Did that mean he was on the road now? Or merely in trouble?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46653.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
