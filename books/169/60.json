{"id":4880,"no":60,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"The Wye Sector had a tradition of opposition to the Entun Dynasty of Cleon I that had been ruling the Empire for over two centuries. The opposition dated back to a time when the line of Mayors of Wye had contributed members who had served as Emperor. The Wyan Dynasty had neither lasted long nor had it been conspicuously successful, but the people and rulers of Wye found it difficult to forget that they had once been-however imperfectly and temporarily-supreme. The brief period when Rashelle, as the self-appointed Mayor of Wye, had challenged the Empire, eighteen years earlier, had added both to Wye\u0027s pride and to its frustration. \\n\\n All this made it reasonable that the small band of leading conspirators should feel as safe in Wye as they would feel anywhere on Trantor. \\n\\n Five of them sat around a table in a room in a run-down portion of the sector. The room was poorly furnished but well shielded. \\n\\n In a chair which, by its marginal superiority in quality to the others, sat the man who might well be judged to be the leader. He had a thin face, a sallow complexion, and a wide mouth with lips so pale as to be nearly invisible. There was a touch of gray in his hair, but his eyes burned with an inextinguishable anger. \\n\\n He was staring at the man seated exactly opposite him-distinctly older and softer, his hair almost white, his plump cheeks tending to quiver when he spoke. \\n\\n The leader said sharply, \"Well? It is quite apparent that you have done nothing. Explain that!\" \\n\\n The older man said, \"I am an old Joranumite, Namarti. Why do I have to explain my actions?\" \\n\\n Gambol Deen Namarti, once the right-hand man of Laskin \"Jo-Jo\" Joranum, said, \"There are many old Joranumites. Some are incompetent, some are soft, some have forgotten. Being an old Joranumite may mean no more than that one is an old fool.\" \\n\\n The older man sat back in his chair. \"Are you calling me an old fool? Me? Kaspal Kaspalov? I was with Jo-Jo when you had not yet joined the party, when you were a ragged nothing in search of a cause.\" \\n\\n \"I am not calling you a fool,\" said Namarti sharply. \"I say simply that some old Joranumites are fools. You have a chance now to show me that you are not one of them.\" \\n\\n \"My association with Jo-Jo-\" \\n\\n \"Forget that. He\u0027s dead!\" \\n\\n \"I should think his spirit lives on.\" \\n\\n \"If that thought will help us in our fight, then his spirit lives on. But to others-not to us. We know he made mistakes.\" \\n\\n \"I deny that.\" \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t insist on making a hero out of a mere man who made mistakes. He thought he could move the Empire by the strength of oratory alone, by words-\" \\n\\n \"History shows that words have moved mountains in the past.\" \\n\\n \"Not Joranum\u0027s words, obviously, because he made mistakes. He hid his Mycogenian origins far too clumsily. Worse, he let himself be tricked into accusing First Minister Eto Demerzel of being a robot. I warned him against that accusation, but he wouldn\u0027t listen-and it destroyed him. Now let\u0027s start fresh, shall we? Whatever use we make of Joranum\u0027s memory for outsiders, let us not ourselves be transfixed by it.\" \\n\\n Kaspalov sat silent. The other three transferred their gaze from Namarti to Kaspalov and back, content to let Namarti carry the weight of the discussion. \\n\\n \"With Joranum\u0027s exile to Nishaya, the Joranumite movement fell apart and seemed to vanish,\" said Namarti harshly. \"It would, indeed, have vanished-but for me. Bit by bit and rubble by rubble, I rebuilt it into a network that extends over all of Trantor. You know this, I take it.\" \\n\\n \"I know it, Chief,\" mumbled Kaspalov. The use of the title made it plain that Kaspalov was seeking reconciliation. \\n\\n Namarti smiled tightly. He did not insist on the title, but he always enjoyed hearing it used. He said, \"You\u0027re part of this network and you have your duties.\" \\n\\n Kaspalov stirred. He was clearly debating with himself internally and finally he said slowly, \"You tell me, Chief, that you warned Joranum against accusing the old First Minister of being a robot. You say he didn\u0027t listen, but at least you had your say. May I have the same privilege of pointing out what I think is a mistake and have you listen to me as Joranum listened to you, even if, like him, you don\u0027t take the advice given you?\" \\n\\n \"Of course you can speak your piece, Kaspalov. You are here in order that you might do so. What is your point?\" \\n\\n \"These new tactics of ours, Chief, are a mistake. They create disruption and do damage.\" \\n\\n \"Of course! They are designed to do that.\" Namarti stirred in his seat, controlling his anger with an effort. \"Joranum tried persuasion. It didn\u0027t work. We will bring Trantor down by action.\" \\n\\n \"For how long? And at what cost?\" \\n\\n \"For as long as it takes-and at very little cost, actually. A power stoppage here, a water break there, a sewage backup, an air-conditioning halt. Inconvenience and discomfort-that\u0027s all it means.\" \\n\\n Kaspalov shook his head. \"These things are cumulative.\" \\n\\n \"Of course, Kaspalov, and we want public dismay and resentment to be cumulative, too. Listen, Kaspalov. The Empire is decaying. Everyone knows that. Everyone capable of intelligent thought knows that. The technology will fail here and there, even if we do nothing. We\u0027re just helping it along a little.\" \\n\\n \"It\u0027s dangerous, Chief. Trantor\u0027s infrastructure is incredibly complicated. A careless push may bring it down in ruins. Pull the wrong string and Trantor may topple like a house of cards.\" \\n\\n \"It hasn\u0027t so far.\" \\n\\n \"It may in the future. And what if the people find out that we are behind it? They would tear us apart. There would be no need to call in the security establishment or the armed forces. Mobs would destroy us.\" \\n\\n \"How would they ever learn enough to blame us? The natural target for the people\u0027s resentment will be the government-the Emperor\u0027s advisers. They will never look beyond that.\" \\n\\n \"And how do we live with ourselves, knowing what we have done?\" \\n\\n This last was asked in a whisper, the old man clearly moved by strong emotion. Kaspalov looked pleadingly across the table at his leader, the man to whom he had sworn allegiance. He had done so in the belief that Namarti would truly continue to bear the standard of freedom passed on by Jo-Jo Joranum; now Kaspalov wondered if this is how Jo-Jo would have wanted his dream to come to pass. \\n\\n Namarti clucked his tongue, much as a reproving parent does when confronting an errant child. \\n\\n \"Kaspalov, you can\u0027t seriously be turning sentimental on us, are you? Once we are in power, we will pick up the pieces and rebuild. We will gather in the people with all of Joranum\u0027s old talk of popular participation in government, with greater representation, and when we are firmly in power we will establish a more efficient and forceful government. We will then have a better Trantor and a stronger Empire. We will set up some sort of discussion system whereby representatives of other worlds can talk themselves into a daze-but we will do the governing.\" \\n\\n Kaspalov sat there, irresolute. \\n\\n Namarti smiled joylessly. \"You are not certain? We can\u0027t lose. It\u0027s been working perfectly and it will continue working perfectly. The Emperor doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s going on. He hasn\u0027t the faintest notion. And his First Minister is a mathematician. He ruined Joranum, true, but since then he has done nothing.\" \\n\\n \"He has something called-called-\" \\n\\n \"Forget it. Joranum attached a great deal of importance to it, but it was a part of his being Mycogenian, like his robot mania. This mathematician has nothing-\" \\n\\n \"Historical psychoanalysis or something like that. I heard Joranum once say-\" \\n\\n \"Forget it. Just do your part. You handle the ventilation in the Anemoria Sector, don\u0027t you? Very well, then. Have it misfunction in a manner of your choosing. It either shuts down so that the humidity rises or it produces a peculiar odor or something else. None of this will kill anyone, so don\u0027t get yourself into a fever of virtuous guilt. You will simply make people uncomfortable and raise the general level of discomfort and annoyance. Can we depend on you?\" \\n\\n \"But what would only be discomfort and annoyance to the young and healthy may be more than that to infants, the aged, and the sick . \" \\n\\n \"Are you going to insist that no one at all must be hurt?\" \\n\\n Kaspalov mumbled something. \\n\\n Namarti said, \"It\u0027s impossible to do anything with a guarantee that no one at all will be hurt. You just do your job. Do it in such a way that you hurt as few as possible-if your conscience insists upon it-but do it!\" \\n\\n Kaspalov said, \"Look! I have one thing more to say, Chief.\" \\n\\n \"Then say it,\" said Namarti wearily. \\n\\n \"We can spend years poking at the infrastructure. The time must come when you take advantage of gathering dissatisfaction to seize the government. How do you intend to do that?\" \\n\\n \"You want to know exactly how we\u0027ll do it?\" \\n\\n \"Yes. The faster we strike, the more limited the damage, the more efficiently the surgery is performed.\" \\n\\n Namarti said slowly, \"I have not yet decided on the nature of this `surgical strike.\u0027 But it will come. Until then, will you do your part?\" \\n\\n Kaspalov nodded his head in resignation. \"Yes, Chief.\" \\n\\n \"Well then, go,\" said Namarti with a sharp gesture of dismissal. \\n\\n Kaspalov rose, turned, and left. Namarti watched him go. He said to the man at his right, \"Kaspalov is not to be trusted. He has sold out and it\u0027s only so that he can betray us that he wants to know my plans for the future. Take care of him \" \\n\\n The other nodded and all three left, leaving Namarti alone in the room. He switched off the glowing wall panels, leaving only a lonely square in the ceiling to provide the light that would keep him from being entirely in the darkness. \\n\\n He thought: Every chain has weak links that must be eliminated. We have had to do this in the past and the result is that we have an organization that is untouchable. \\n\\n And in the dimness, he smiled, twisting his face into a kind of feral joy. After all, the network extended even into the Palace itself-not quite firmly, not quite reliably, but it was there. And it would be strengthened. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46641.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
