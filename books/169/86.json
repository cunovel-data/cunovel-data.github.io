{"id":4906,"no":86,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"Manella said thoughtfully, \"I guess I won\u0027t be seeing you anymore, Planchet.\" Raych was drying himself after his shower. \"Why not?\" \"Gleb Andorin doesn\u0027t want me to.\" \"Why not?\" Manella shrugged her smooth shoulders. \"He says you have important work to do and no more time to fool around. Maybe he means you\u0027ll get a better job.\" Raych stiffened. \"What kind of work? Did he mention anything in particular?\" \"No, but he said he would be going to the Imperial Sector.\" \"Did he? Does he often tell you things like that?\" \"You know how it is, Planchet. When a fellow\u0027s in bed with you, he talks a lot.\" \"I know,\" said Raych, who was always careful not to. \"What else does he say?\" \"Why do you ask?\" She frowned a bit. \"He always asks about you, too. I noticed that about men. They\u0027re curious about each other. Why is that, do you suppose?\" \"What do you tell him about me?\" \"Not much. Just that you\u0027re a very decent sort of guy. Naturally I don\u0027t tell him that I like you better than I like him. That would hurt his feelings-and it might hurt me, too.\" Raych was getting dressed. \"So it\u0027s good-bye, then.\" \"For a while, I suppose. Gleb may change his mind. Of course, I\u0027d like to go to the Imperial Sector-if he\u0027d take me. I\u0027ve never been there.\" Raych almost slipped, but he managed to cough, then said, \"I\u0027ve never been there, either.\" \"It\u0027s got the biggest buildings and the nicest places and the fanciest restaurants-and that\u0027s where the rich people live. I\u0027d like to meet some rich people-besides Gleb, I mean.\" Raych said, \"I suppose there\u0027s not much you can get out of a person like me.\" \"You\u0027re all right. You can\u0027t think of credits all the time, but you\u0027ve got to think of them some of the time. Especially since I think Gleb is getting tired of me.\" Raych felt compelled to say, \"No one could get tired of you,\" and then found, a little to his own confusion, that he meant it. Manella said, \"That\u0027s what men always say, but you\u0027d be surprised. Anyway, it\u0027s been good, you and I, Planchet. Take care of yourself and, who knows, we may see each other again.\" Raych nodded and found himself at a loss for words. There was no way in which he could say or do anything to express his feelings. He turned his mind in other directions. He had to find out what the Namarti people were planning. If they were separating him from Manella, the crisis must be rapidly approaching. All he had to go on was that odd question about gardening. Nor could he get any further information back to Seldon. He had been kept under close scrutiny since his meeting with Namarti and all avenues of communication were cut off-surely another indication of an approaching crisis. But if he were to find out what was going on only after it was done-and if he could communicate the news only after it was no longer news-he would have failed.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46701.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
