{"id":5014,"no":194,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"Seldon was enraged. \"I\u0027ve never been in custody before in my entire life. A couple of months ago eight men assaulted me. I was able to fight them off with the help of my son, but while that was going on was there a security officer in sight? Did people stop to help me? No. This time, I\u0027m better prepared and I knocked a man flat who had been about to assault me. Was there a security officer in sight? Absolutely. She put the collar on me. There were people watching, too, and they were amused at seeing an old man being taken in for assault and battery. What kind of world do we live on?\" Civ Novker, Seldon\u0027s lawyer, sighed and said calmly, \"A corrupt world, but don\u0027t worry. Nothing will happen to you. I\u0027ll get you out on bail and then, eventually, you\u0027ll come back for trial before a jury of your peers and the most you\u0027ll get-the very most-are some hard words from the bench. Your age and your reputation-\" \"Forget my reputation,\" said Seldon, still angry. \"I\u0027m a psychohistorian and, at the present time, that is a dirty word. They\u0027ll be glad to see me in jail.\" \"No, they won\u0027t,\" said Novker. \"There may be some screwballs who have it in for you, but I\u0027ll see to it that none of them gets on the jury.\" Wanda said, \"Do we really have to subject my grandfather to all this? He\u0027s not a young man anymore. Can\u0027t we just appear before the magistrate and not bother with a jury trial?\" The lawyer turned to her. \"It can be done. If you\u0027re insane, maybe. Magistrates are impatient power-mad people who would just as soon put a person into jail for a year as listen to him. No one goes up before a magistrate.\" \"I think we should,\" said Wanda. Seldon said, \"Well now, Wanda, I think we ought to listen to Civ-\" But as he said that, he felt a strong churning in his abdomen. It was Wanda\u0027s \"push.\" Seldon said, \"Well-if you insist.\" \"She can\u0027t insist,\" said the lawyer. \"I won\u0027t allow it.\" Wanda said, \"My grandfather is your client. If he wants something done his way, you\u0027ve got to do it.\" \"I can refuse to represent him.\" \"Well then, leave,\" said Wanda sharply, \"and we\u0027ll face the magistrate alone.\" Novker thought and said, \"Very well, then-if you\u0027re going to be so adamant. I\u0027ve represented Hari for years and I suppose I won\u0027t abandon him now. But I warn you, the chances are he\u0027ll get a jail sentence and I\u0027ll have to work like the devil to get it lifted-if I can do it .at all.\" \"I\u0027m not afraid,\" said Wanda. Seldon bit his lip and the lawyer turned to him. \"What about you? Are you willing to let your granddaughter call the shots?\" Seldon thought a bit, then admitted, much to the old lawyer\u0027s surprise, \"Yes. Yes, I am.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46922.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
