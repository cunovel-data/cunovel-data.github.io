{"id":4848,"no":28,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"Billibotton was Billibotton-dirty, sprawling, dark, sinuous Billibotton-exuding decay and yet full of a vitality that Raych was convinced was to be found nowhere else on Trantor. Perhaps it was to be found nowhere else in the Empire, though Raych knew nothing, firsthand, of any world but Trantor. He had last seen Billibotton when he was not much more than twelve, but even the people seemed to be the same; still a mixture of the hangdog and the irreverent; filled with a synthetic pride and a grumbling resentment; the men marked by their dark rich mustaches and the women by their sacklike dresses that now looked tremendously slatternly to Raych\u0027s older and more worldly wise eyes. How could women with dresses like that attract men? -But it was a foolish question. Even when he was twelve, he had had a pretty clear idea of how easily and quickly they could be removed. So he stood there, lost in thought and memory, passing along a street of store windows and trying to convince himself that he remembered this particular place or that and wondering if, among them all, there were people he did remember who were now eight years older. Those, perhaps, who had been his boyhood friends-and he thought uneasily of the fact that, while he remembered some of the nicknames they had pinned on each other, he could not remember any real names. In fact, the gaps in his memory were enormous. It was not that eight years was such a long time, but it was two fifths of the lifetime of a twenty-year-old and his life since leaving Billibotton had been so different that all before it had faded like a misty dream. But the smells were there. He stopped outside a bakery, low and dingy, and smelled the coconut icing that reeked through the air-that he had never quite smelled elsewhere. Even when he had stopped to buy tarts with coconut icing, even when they were advertised as \"Dahl-style,\" they had been faint imitations-no more. He felt strongly tempted. Well, why not? He had the credits and Dors was not there to wrinkle her nose and wonder aloud how clean-or, more likely, not clean-the place might be. Who worried about clean in the old days? The shop was dim and it took a while for Raych\u0027s eyes to acclimate. There were a few low tables in the place, with a couple of rather insubstantial chairs at each, undoubtedly where people might have a light repast, the equivalent of moka and tarts. A young man sat at one of the tables, an empty cup before him, wearing a once-white T-shirt that probably would have looked even dirtier in a better light. The baker or, in any case, a server stepped out from a room in the rear and said in a rather surly fashion, \"What\u0027ll ya have?\" \"A coke-icer,\" said Raych in just as surly a fashion (he would not be a Billibottoner if he displayed courtesy), using the slang term he remembered well from the old days. The term was still current, for the server handed him the correct item, using his bare fingers. The boy, Raych, would have taken that for granted, but now the man, Raych, felt taken slightly aback. \"You want a bag?\" \"No,\" said Raych, \"I\u0027ll eat it here.\" He paid the server and took the coke-icer from the other\u0027s hand and bit into its richness, his eyes half closing as he did so. It had been a rare treat in his boyhood-sometimes when he had scrounged the necessary credit to buy one with, sometimes when he had received a bite from a temporarily wealthy friend, most often when he had lifted one when nobody was watching. Now he could buy as many as he wished. \"Hey,\" said a voice. Raych opened his eyes. It was the man at the table, scowling at him. Raych said gently, \"Are you speaking to me, bub?\" \"Yeah. What\u0027chuh Join\u0027?\" \"Eatin\u0027 a coke-icer. What\u0027s it to ya?\" Automatically he had assumed the Billibotton way of talking. It was no strain at all. \"What\u0027chuh doin\u0027 in Billibotton?\" \"Born here. Raised here. In a bed. Not in a street, like you.\" The insult came easily, as though he had never left home. \"That so? You dress pretty good for a Billibottoner. Pretty fancy-dancy. Got a perfume stink about ya.\" And he held up a little finger to imply effeminacy. \"I won\u0027t talk about your stink. I went up in the world.\" \"Up in the world? La-dee-da. \" Two other men stepped into the bakery. Raych frowned slightly, for he wasn\u0027t sure whether they had been summoned or not. The man at the table said to the newcomers, \"This guy\u0027s gone up in the world. Says he\u0027s a Billibottoner.\" One of the two newcomers shambled a mock salute and grinned with no appearance of amiability. His teeth were discolored. \"Ain\u0027t that nice? It\u0027s always good to see a Billibottoner go up in the world. Gives \u0027em a chance to help their poor unfor\u0027chnit sector people. Like, credits. You can always spare a credit or two for the poor, hey?\" \"How many you got, mister?\" said the other, the grin disappearing. \"Hey,\" said the man behind the counter. \"All you guys get out of my store. I don\u0027t want no trouble in here.\" \"There\u0027ll be no trouble,\" said Raych. \"I\u0027m leaving.\" He made to go, but the seated man put a leg in his way. \"Don\u0027t go, pal. We\u0027d miss yer company.\" (The man behind the counter, clearly fearing the worst, disappeared into the rear.) Raych smiled. He said, \"One time when I was in Billibotton, guys, I was with my old man and old lady and there were ten guys who stopped us. Ten. I counted them. We had to take care of them.\" \"Yeah?\" said the one who had been speaking. \"Yer old man took care of ten?\" \"My old man? Nah. He wouldn\u0027t waste his time. My old lady did. And I can do it better than she can. And there are only three of you. So, if you don\u0027t mind, out of the way.\" \"Sure. Just leave all your credits. Some of your clothes, too.\" The man at the table rose to his feet. There was a knife in his hand. \"There you are,\" said Raych. \"Now you\u0027re going to waste my time.\" He had finished his coke-icer and he half-turned. Then, as quickly as thought, he anchored himself to the table, while his right leg shot out and the point of his toe landed unerringly in the groin of the man with the knife. Down he went with a loud cry. Up went the table, driving the second man toward the wall and keeping him there, while Raych\u0027s right arm flashed out, with the edge of the palm striking hard against the larynx of the third, who coughed and went down. It had taken two seconds and Raych now stood there with a knife in each hand and said, \"Now which one of you wants to move?\" They glared at him but remained frozen in place and Raych said, \"In that case, I will now leave.\" But the server, who had retreated to the back room, must have summoned help, for three more men had now entered the store, while the server screeched, \"Troublemakers! Nothing but troublemakers!\" The newcomers were dressed alike in what was obviously a uniform-but one that Raych had never seen. Trousers were tucked into boots, loose green T-shirts were belted, and odd semispherical hats that looked vaguely comic were perched on top of their heads. On the front of the left shoulder of each T-shirt were the letters Jc. They had the Dahlite look about them but not quite the Dahlite mustache. The mustaches were black and thick, but they were carefully trimmed at lip level and were kept from luxuriating too widely. Raych allowed himself an internal sneer. They lacked the vigor of his own wild mustache, but he had to admit they looked neat and clean. The leader of these three men said, \"I\u0027m Corporal Quinber. What\u0027s been going on here?\" The defeated Billibottoners were scrambling to their feet, clearly the worse for wear. One was still doubled over, one was rubbing his throat, and the third acted as though one of his shoulders had been wrenched. The corporal stared at them with a philosophic eye, while his two men blocked the door. He turned to Raych-the one man who seemed untouched. \"Are you a Billibottoner, boy?\" \"Born and bred, but I\u0027ve lived elsewhere for eight years.\" He let the Billibotton accent recede, but it was still there, at least to the extent that it existed in the corporal\u0027s speech as well. There were other parts of Dahl aside from Billibotton and some parts with considerable aspirations to gentility. Raych said, \"Are you security officers? I don\u0027t seem to recall the uniform you\u0027re-\" \"We\u0027re not security officers. You won\u0027t find security officers in Billibotton much. We\u0027re the Joranum Guard and we keep the peace here. We know these three and they\u0027ve been warned. We\u0027ll take care of them. You\u0027re our problem, buster. Name. Reference number.\" Raych told them. \"And what happened here?\" Raych told them. \"And your business here?\" Raych said, \"Look here. Do you have the right to question me? If you\u0027re not security officers-\" \"Listen,\" said the corporal in a hard voice, \"don\u0027t you question rights. We\u0027re all there is in Billibotton and we have the right because we take the right. You say you beat up these three men and I believe you. But you won\u0027t beat us up. We\u0027re not allowed to carry blasters-\" And with that, the corporal slowly pulled out a blaster. \"Now tell me your business here.\" Raych sighed. If he had gone directly to a sector hall, as he should have done-if he had not stopped to drown himself in nostalgia for Billibotton and coke-icers- He said, \"I have come on important business to see Mr. Joranum, and since you seem to be part of his organi-\u0027 \"To see the leader?\" \"Yes, Corporal.\" \"With two knives on you?\" \"For self-defense. I wasn\u0027t going to have them on me when I saw Mr. Joranum.\" \"So you say. We\u0027re taking you into custody, mister. We\u0027ll get to the bottom of this. It may take time, but we will.\" \"But you don\u0027t have the right. You\u0027re not the legally const \" \"Well, find someone to complain to. Till then, you\u0027re ours.\" And the knives were confiscated and Raych was taken into custody.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46534.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
