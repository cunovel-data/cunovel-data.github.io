{"id":4844,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"For days thereafter Hari Seldon neglected his departmental duties to use his computer in its news-gathering mode. \n There were not many computers capable of handling the daily news from twenty-five million worlds. There were a number of them at Imperial headquarters, where they were absolutely necessary. Some of the larger Outer World capitals had them as well, though most were satisfied with hyperconnection to the Central Newspost on Trantor. \n A computer at an important Mathematics Department could, if it were sufficiently advanced, be modified as an independent news source and Seldon had been careful to do that with his computer. It was, after all, necessary for his work on psychohistory, though the computer\u0027s capabilities were carefully ascribed to other, exceedingly plausible reasons. \n Ideally the computer would report anything that was out of the ordinary on any world of the Empire. A coded and unobtrusive warning light would make itself evident and Seldon could track it down easily. Such a light rarely showed, for the definition of \"out of the ordinary\" was tight and intense and dealt with large-scale and rare upheavals. \n What one did in its absence was to ring in various worlds at random -not all twenty-five million, of course, but some dozens. It was a depressing and even debilitating task, for there were no worlds that didn\u0027t have their daily relatively minor catastrophes. A volcanic eruption here, a flood there, an economic collapse of one sort or another yonder, and, of course, riots. There had not been a day in the last thousand years that there had not been riots over something or other on each of a hundred or more different worlds. \n Naturally such things had to be discounted. One could scarcely worry about riots any more than one could about volcanic eruptions when both were constants on inhabited worlds. Rather, if a day should come in which not one riot was reported anywhere, that might be a sign of something so unusual as to warrant the gravest concern. \n Concern was what Seldon could not make himself feel. The Outer Worlds, with all their disorders and misfortunes, were like a great ocean on a peaceful day, with a gentle swell and minor heavings-but no more. He found no evidence of any overall situation that clearly showed a decline in the last eight years or even in the last eighty. Yet Demerzel (in Demerzel\u0027s absence, Seldon could no longer think of him as Daneel) said the decline was continuing and he had his finger on the Empire\u0027s pulse from day to day in ways that Seldon could not duplicate-until such time as he would have the guiding power of psychohistory at his disposal. \n It could be that the decline was so small that it was unnoticeable till some crucial point was reached-like a domicile that slowly wears out and deteriorates, showing no signs of that deterioration until one night when the roof collapses. \n When would the roof collapse? That was the problem and Seldon had no answer. \n And on occasion, Seldon would check on Trantor itself. There, the news was always considerably more substantial. For one thing, Trantor was the most highly populated of all the worlds, with its forty billion people. For another, its eight hundred sectors formed a mini-Empire all its own. For a third, there were the tedious rounds of governmental functions and the doings of the Imperial family to follow. \n What struck Seldon\u0027s eyes, however, was in the Dahl Sector. The elections for the Dahl Sector Council had placed five Joranumites into office. This was the first time, according to the commentary, that Joranumites had achieved sector office. \n It was not surprising. Dahl was a Joranumite stronghold if any sector was, but Seldon found it a disturbing indication of the progress being made by the demagogue. He ordered a microchip of the item and took it home with him that evening. \n Raych looked up from his computer as Seldon entered and apparently felt the need to explain himself. \"I\u0027m helping Mom on some reference material she needs,\" he said. \n \"What about your own work?\" \n \"Done, Dad. All done.\" \n \"Good. -Look at this.\" He showed Raych the chip in his hand before slipping it into the microprojector. \n Raych glanced at the news item hanging in the air before his eyes and said, \"Yes, I know.\" \n \"You do?\" \n \"Sure. I usually keep track of Dahl. You know, home sector and all.\" \n \"And what do you think about it?\" \n \"I\u0027m not surprised. Are you? The rest of Trantor treats Dahl like dirt. Why shouldn\u0027t they go for Joranum\u0027s views?\" \n \"Do you go for them also?\" \n \"Well-\" Raych twisted his face thoughtfully. \"I got to admit some things he says appeal to me. He says he wants equality for all people. What\u0027s wrong with that?\" \n \"Nothing at all-if he means it. If he\u0027s sincere. If he isn\u0027t just using it as a ploy to get votes.\" \n \"True enough, Dad, but most Dahlites probably figure: What\u0027s there to lose? We don\u0027t have equality now, though the laws say we do.\" \n \"It\u0027s a hard thing to legislate.\" \n \"That\u0027s not something to cool you off when you\u0027re sweating to death.\" \n Seldon was thinking rapidly. He had been thinking since he had come across this item. He said, \"Raych, you haven\u0027t been in Dahl since your mother and I took you out of the sector, have you?\" \n \"Sure I was, when I went with you to Dahl five years ago on your visit there.\" \n \"Yes yes\"-Seldon waved a hand in dismissal-\"but that doesn\u0027t count. We stayed at an intersector hotel, which was not Dahlite in the least, and, as I recall, Dors never once let you out on the streets alone. After all, you were only fifteen. How would you like to visit Dahl now, alone, in charge of yourself-now that you\u0027re fully twenty?\" \n Raych chuckled. \"Mom would never allow that.\" \n \"I don\u0027t say that I enjoy the prospect of facing her with it, but I don\u0027t intend to ask her permission. The question is: Would you be willing to do this for me?\" \n \"Out of curiosity? Sure. I\u0027d like to see what\u0027s happened to the old place.\" \n \"Can you spare the time from your studies?\" \n \"Sure. I\u0027ll never miss a week or so. Besides, you can tape the lectures and I\u0027ll catch up when I get back. I can get permission. After all, my old man\u0027s on the faculty-unless you\u0027ve been fired, Dad.\" \n \"Not yet. But I\u0027m not thinking of this as a fun vacation.\" \n \"I\u0027d be surprised if you did. I don\u0027t think you know what a fun vacation is, Dad. I\u0027m surprised you know the phrase.\" \n \"Don\u0027t be impertinent. When you go there, I want you to meet with Laskin Joranum.\" \n Raych looked startled. \"How do I do that? I don\u0027t know where he\u0027s gonna be.\" \n \"He\u0027s going to be in Dahl. He\u0027s been asked to speak to the Dahl Sector Council with its new Joranumite members. We\u0027ll find out the exact day and you can go a few days earlier.\" \n \"And how do I get to see him, Dad? I don\u0027t figure he keeps open house.\" \n \"I don\u0027t, either, but I\u0027ll leave that up to you. You would have known how to do it when you were twelve. I hope your keen edge hasn\u0027t blunted too badly in the intervening years.\" \n Raych smiled. \"I hope not. But suppose I do see him. What then?\" \n \"Well, find out what you can. What\u0027s he\u0027s really planning. What he\u0027s really thinking.\" \n \"Do you really think he\u0027s gonna tell me?\" \n \"I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if he does. You have the trick of inspiring confidence, you miserable youngster. Let\u0027s talk about it.\" \n And so they did. Several times. \n Seldon\u0027s thoughts were painful. He was not sure where all this was leading to, but he dared not consult Yugo Amaryl or Demerzel or (most of all) Dors. They might stop him. They might prove to him that his idea was a poor one and he didn\u0027t want that proof. What he planned seemed the only gateway to salvation and he didn\u0027t want it blocked. \n But did the gateway exist at all? Raych was the only one, it seemed to Seldon, who could possibly manage to worm himself into Joranum\u0027s confidence, but was Raych the proper tool for the purpose? He was a Dahlite and sympathetic to Joranum. How far could Seldon trust him? \n Horrible? Raych was his son-and Seldon had never had occasion to mistrust Raych before. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46530.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
