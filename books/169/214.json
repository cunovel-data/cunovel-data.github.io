{"id":5034,"no":214,"title":"Chapter 28","content":"\"Wanda dear, what is it that has you so engrossed?\" asked Hari Seldon as he entered his granddaughter\u0027s office at Streeling University. The room had been the office of the brilliant mathematician Yugo Amaryl, whose death had impoverished the Psychohistory Project. Fortunately, \n Wanda had gradually taken over Yugo\u0027s role in recent years, further refining and adjusting the Prime Radiant. \n \"Why, I\u0027m working on an equation in Section 33A2D17. See, I\u0027ve recalibrated this section\"-she gestured to a glowing violet patch suspended in midair in front of her face- `taking into consideration the standard quotient and- There! Just what I thought-I think.\" She stepped back and rubbed her eyes. \n \"What is it, Wanda?\" Hari moved in closer to study the equation. \"Why, this looks like the Terminus equation and yet . Wanda, this is an inverse of the Terminus equation, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \"Yes, Grandpa. See, the numbers weren\u0027t working quite right in the Terminus equation-look.\" Wanda touched a contact in a recessed wallstrip and another patch sprang to life in vivid red on the other side of the room. Seldon and Wanda walked over to inspect it. \"You see how it\u0027s all hanging together fine now, Grandpa? It\u0027s taken me weeks to get it this way.\" \n \"How did you do it?\" asked Hari, admiring the equation\u0027s lines, its logic, its elegance. \n \"At first, I concentrated on it from over here only. I blocked out all else. In order to get Terminus to work, work on Terminus--stands to reason, doesn\u0027t it? But then I realized that I couldn\u0027t just introduce this equation into the Prime Radiant system and expect it to blend right in smoothly, as if nothing happened. A placement means a displacement somewhere else. A weight needs a counterweight.\" \n \"I think the concept to which you are referring is what the ancients called din and yang. \u0027 \" \n \"Yes, more or less. Yin and yang. So, you see, I realized that to perfect the yin of Terminus, I had to locate its yang. Which I did, over there.\" She moved back to the violet patch, tucked away at the other edge of the Prime Radiant sphere. \"And once I adjusted the figures here, the Terminus equation fell into place as well. Harmony!\" Wanda looked pleased with herself, as if she\u0027d solved all the problems of the Empire. \n \"Fascinating, Wanda, and later on you must tell me what you think it all means for the Project. -But right now you must come with me to the holoscreen. I received an urgent message from Santanni a few minutes ago. Your father wants us to call him immediately.\" \n Wanda\u0027s smile faded. She had been alarmed at the recent reports of fighting on Santanni. As Imperial budget cutbacks went into effect, the citizens of the Outer Worlds suffered most. They had limited access to the richer, more populous Inner Worlds and it became more and more difficult to trade their worlds\u0027 products for much needed imports. Imperial hyperships going in and out of Santanni were few and the distant world felt isolated from the rest of the Empire. Pockets of rebellion had erupted throughout the planet. \n \"Grandfather, I hope everything\u0027s all right,\" said Wanda, her fear revealed by her voice. \n \"Don\u0027t worry, dear. After all, they must be safe if Raych was able to send us a message.\" \n In Seldon\u0027s office, he and Wanda stood before the holoscreen as it activated. Seldon punched a code on the keypad alongside the screen and they waited a few seconds for the intragalactic connection to be established. Slowly the screen seemed to stretch back into the wall, as if it were the entrance to a tunnel-and out of the tunnel, dimly at first, came the familiar figure of a stocky powerfully built man. As the connection sharpened, the man\u0027s features became clearer. When Seldon and Wanda were able to make out Raych\u0027s bushy Dahlite mustache, the figure sprang to life. \n \"Dad! Wanda!\" said Raych\u0027s three-dimensional hologram, projected to Trantor from Santanni. \"Listen, I don\u0027t have much time.\" He flinched, as if startled by a loud noise. \"Things have gotten pretty bad here. The government has fallen and a provisional party has taken over. Things are a mess, as you can imagine. I just put Manella and Bellis on a hypership to Anacreon. I told them to get in touch with you from there. The name of the ship is the Arcadia VII. \n \"You should have seen Manella, Dad. Mad as anything that she had to go. The only way I was able to convince her to leave was to point out that it was for Bellis\u0027s sake. \n \"I know what you\u0027re thinking, Dad and Wanda. Of course I would have gone with them-if I could have. But there wasn\u0027t enough room. You should\u0027ve seen what I had to go through just to get them onto the ship.\" Raych flashed one of his lopsided grins that Seldon and Wanda loved so much, then continued. \"Besides, since I\u0027m here, I have to help guard the University-we may be part of the Imperial University system, but we\u0027re a place of learning and building, not of destruction. I tell you, if one of those hot-headed Santanni rebels comes near our stuff-\" \n \"Raych,\" Hari broke in, \"How bad is it? Are you close to the fighting?\" \n \"Dad, are you in danger?\" asked Wanda. \n They waited a few seconds for their message to travel the nine thousand parsecs across the Galaxy to Raych. \n \"I-I-1 couldn\u0027t quite make out what you said,\" the hologram replied. \"There\u0027s a bit of fighting going on. It\u0027s sort of exciting, actually,\" Raych said, breaking into that grin again. \"So I\u0027m going to sign off now. Remember, find out what happened to the Arcadia III going to Anacreon. I\u0027ll be back in touch as soon as I\u0027m able. Remember, I-\" The transmission broke off and the hologram faded. The holoscreen tunnel collapsed in on itself so that Seldon and Wanda were left staring at a blank wall. \n \"Grandpa,\" said Wanda, \"what do you think he was going to say?\" \n \"I have no idea, dear. But there is one thing I do know and that is that your father can take care of himself. I pity any rebel who gets near enough for a well-placed Twist-kick from your dad! -Come, let\u0027s get back to that equation and in a few hours we\u0027ll check on the Arcadia HI. \" \n \n \"Commander, have you no idea what happened to the ship?\" Hari Seldon was again engaged in intragalactic conversation, but this time it was with an Imperial navy commander stationed at Anacreon. For this communication, Seldon was making use of the visiscreen-much less realistic than the holoscreen but also much simpler. \n \"I\u0027m telling you, Professor, that we have no record of that hypership requesting permission to enter the Anacreonic atmosphere. Of course, communications with Santanni have been broken for several hours and sporadic at best for the last week. It is possible that the ship tried to reach us on a Santanni-based channel and could not get through, but I doubt it. \n \"No, it\u0027s more likely that the Arcadia 1171 changed destination. Voreg, perhaps, or Sarip. Have you tried either of those worlds, Professor?\" \n \"No,\" said Seldon wearily, \"but I see no reason if the ship was bound for Anacreon that it would not go to Anacreon. Commander, it is vital that I locate that ship.\" \n \"Of course,\" the commander ventured, \"the Arcadia 1/71 might not have made it. Out safely, I mean. There\u0027s a lot of fighting going on. Those rebels don\u0027t care who they blow up. They just train their lasers and pretend it\u0027s the Emperor Agis they\u0027re blasting. I tell you, it\u0027s a whole different game out here on the fringe, Professor.\" \n \"My daughter-in-law and granddaughter are on that ship, Commander,\" Seldon said in a tight voice. \n \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry, Professor,\" said an abashed commander. \"I\u0027ll be in touch with you as soon as I hear anything.\" \n Dispiritedly Hari closed the visiscreen contact. How tired I am, he thought. And, he mused, I\u0027m not surprised-I\u0027ve known that this would come for nearly forty years. \n Seldon chuckled bitterly to himself. Perhaps that commander had thought he was shocking Seldon, impressing him with the vivid detail of life \"on the fringe.\" But Seldon knew all about the fringe. And as the fringe came apart, like a piece of knitting with one loose thread, the whole piece would unravel to the core: Trantor. \n Seldon became aware of a soft buzzing sound. It was the door signal. \"Yes?\" \n \"Grandpa,\" said Wanda, entering the office, \"I\u0027m scared.\" \n \"Why, dear?\" asked Seldon with concern. He didn\u0027t want to tell her yet what he had learned-or hadn\u0027t learned-from the commander on Anacreon. \n \"Usually, although they\u0027re so far away, I feel Dad and Mom and Bellis -feel them in here\"-she pointed to her head- `and in here\"-she placed her hand over her heart. \"But now, today, I don\u0027t feel them-it feels less, as if they\u0027re fading, like one of the dome bulbs. And I want to stop it. I want to pull them back, but I can\u0027t.\" \n \"Wanda, I really think this is merely a product of your concern for your family in light of the rebellion. You know that uprisings occur all over the Empire all the time-little eruptions to let off steam. Come now, you know that chances of anything happening to Raych, Manella, or Bellis are vanishingly small. Your dad will call any day to say all is well; your mom and Bellis will land on Anacreon at any moment and enjoy a little vacation. We are the ones to be pitied-we\u0027re stuck here up to our ears in work! So, sweetheart, go to bed and think only good thoughts. I promise you, tomorrow, under the sunny dome, things will look much better.\" \n \"All right, Grandpa,\" said Wanda, not sounding entirely convinced. \"But tomorrow-if we haven\u0027t heard by tomorrow-we\u0027ll have to-to-\" \n \"Wanda, what can we do, except wait?\" asked Hari, his voice gentle. \n Wanda turned and left, the weight of her worries showing in the slope of her shoulders. Hari watched her go, finally allowing his own worries to come to the surface. \n It had been three days since the hologram transmission from Raych. Since then-nothing. And today the naval commander at Anacreon denied ever having heard of a ship called Arcadia VII \n Hari had tried earlier to get through to Raych on Santanni, but all communication beams were down. It was as if Santanni-and the Arcadia VII-had simply broken off from the Empire, like a petal from a flower. \n Seldon knew what he had to do now. The Empire might be down, but it was not out. Its power, when properly wielded, was still awesome. Seldon placed an emergency transmission to Emperor Agis XIV. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46942.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
