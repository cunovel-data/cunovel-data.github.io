He had conducted the Project in the same fashion that he always did: pushing always forward in the development of psychohistory, making plans for the Foundation, studying the Prime Radiant. \\n\\n But he did not smile. All he did was to force himself through his work without any feeling of impending success. Rather, there was a feeling of impending failure about everything. \\n\\n And now, as he sat in his office at Streeling University, Wanda entered. He looked up at her and his heart lifted. Wanda had always been special. Seldon couldn\u0027t put his finger on just when he and the others had started accepting her pronouncements with more than the usual enthusiasm; it just seemed always to have been that way. As a little girl, she had saved his life with her uncanny knowledge of \"lemonade death\" and all through her childhood she had somehow just known things. \\n\\n Although Dr. Endelecki had asserted that Wanda\u0027s genome was perfectly normal in every way, Seldon was still positive that his granddaughter possessed mental abilities far beyond those of average humans. And he was just as sure that there were others like her in the Galaxy-on Trantor, even. If only he could find them, these mentalics, what a great contribution they could make to the Foundation. The potential for such greatness all centered in his beautiful granddaughter. Seldon gazed at her, framed in his office doorway, and he felt as if his heart would break. In a few days, she would be gone. \\n\\n How could he bear it? She was such a beautiful girl-eighteen. Long blond hair, face a little broad but with a tendency to smile. She was even smiling now and Seldon thought, Why not? She\u0027s heading for Santanni and for a new life. \\n\\n He said, \"Well, Wanda, just a few more days.\" \\n\\n \"No. I don\u0027t think so, Grandpa.\" \\n\\n He stared at her. \"What?\" \\n\\n Wanda approached him and put her arms around him. \"I\u0027m not going to Santanni.\" \\n\\n \"Have your father and mother changed their minds?\" \\n\\n \"No, they\u0027re going.\" \\n\\n \"And you\u0027re not? Why? Where are you going?\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to stay here, Grandpa. With you.\" She hugged him. \"Poor Grandpa!\" \\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t understand. Why? Are they allowing this?\" \\n\\n \"You mean Mom and Dad. Not really. We\u0027ve been arguing over this for weeks, but I\u0027ve won out. Why not, Grandpa? They\u0027ll go to Santanni and they\u0027ll have each other-and they\u0027ll have little Bellis, too. But if I go with them and leave you here, you\u0027ll have no one. I don\u0027t think I could stand that.\" \\n\\n \"But how did you get them to agree?\" \\n\\n \"Well, you know-I pushed.\" \\n\\n \"What does that mean?\" \\n\\n \"It\u0027s my mind. I can see what you have in yours and in theirs and, as time goes on, I can see more clearly. And I can push them to do what I want.\" \\n\\n \"How do you do that?\" \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. But after a while, they get tired of being pushed and they\u0027re willing to let me have my way. So I\u0027m going to stay with you.\" \\n\\n Seldon looked up at her with helpless love. \"This is wonderful, Wanda. But Bellis-\" \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry about Bellis. She doesn\u0027t have a mind like mine.\" \\n\\n \"Are you certain?\" Seldon chewed at his lower lip. \\n\\n \"Quite certain. Besides, Mom and Dad have to have someone, too.\" \\n\\n Seldon wanted to rejoice, but he couldn\u0027t do so openly. There were Raych and Manella. What of them? \\n\\n He said, \"Wanda, what about your parents? Can you be so cold-blooded about them?\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not cold-blooded. They understand. They realize I must be with you.\" \\n\\n \"How did you manage that?\" \\n\\n \"I pushed,\" said Wanda simply, \"and eventually they came to see it my way. \\n\\n \"You can do that?\" \\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t easy.\" \\n\\n \"And you did it because-\" Seldon paused. \\n\\n Wanda said, \"Because I love you. Of course. And because-\" \\n\\n \"Yes?\" \\n\\n \"I must learn psychohistory. I know quite a bit of it already.\" \\n\\n \"How?\" \\n\\n \"From your mind. From the minds of others at the Project, especially from Uncle Yugo before he died. But it\u0027s in rags and tatters, so far. I want the real thing. Grandpa, I want a Prime Radiant of my own.\" Her face lit up and her words came quickly, with passion. \"I want to study psychohistory in great detail. Grandpa, you\u0027re quite old and quite tired. I\u0027m young and eager. I want to learn all I can, so I can carry on when-\" \\n\\n Seldon said, \"Well, that would be wonderful-if you could do it-but there is no funding anymore. I\u0027ll teach you all I can, but-we can\u0027t do anything.\" \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll see, Grandpa. We\u0027ll see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46916.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
