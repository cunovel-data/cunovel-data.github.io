{"id":5002,"no":182,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"Las Zenow said with a certain trace of awe in his voice, \"I didn\u0027t know you were so friendly with the Emperor, Professor Seldon.\" \n \"Why not? He\u0027s a very democratic fellow for an Emperor and he was interested in my experiences as a First Minister in Cleon\u0027s time.\" \n \"It made a deep impression on us all. We haven\u0027t had an Emperor in our halls for many years. Generally, when the Emperor needs something from the Library-\" \n \"I can imagine. He calls for it and it is brought to him as a matter of courtesy.\" \n \"There was once a suggestion,\" said Zenow chattily, \"that the Emperor be outfitted with a complete set of computerized equipment in his palace, hooked directly into the Library system, so that he would not need to wait for service. This was in the old days when credits were plentiful, but, you know, it was voted down.\" \n \"Was it?\" \n \"Oh yes, almost the entire Board agreed that it would make the Emperor too much a part of the Library and that this would threaten our independence from the government.\" \n \"And does this Board, which will not bend to honor an Emperor, consent to let me remain at the Library?\" \n \"At the present moment, yes. There is a feeling-and I\u0027ve done my best to encourage it-that if we are not polite to a personal friend of the Emperor, the chance of a rise in appropriations will be gone altogether, so-\" \n \"So credits-or even the dim prospect of credits-talk.\" \n \"I\u0027m afraid so.\" \n \"And can I bring in my colleagues?\" \n Zenow looked embarrassed. \"I\u0027m afraid not. The Emperor was seen walking only with you-not with your colleagues. I\u0027m sorry, Professor.\" \n Seldon shrugged and a mood of deep melancholy swept over him. He had no colleague to bring in, anyhow. For some time he had hoped to locate others like Wanda and he had failed. He, too, would need funding to mount an adequate search. And he, too, had nothing. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46910.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
