{"id":4918,"no":98,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"They were lined up beautifully, feet spread apart, hands behind their hacks, every one in a natty green uniform, loosely fitted and with wide pockets. There was very little gender differential and one could only guess that some of the shorter ones were women. The hoods covered whatever hair they had, but then, gardeners were supposed to clip their hair quite short-either sex-and there could be no facial hair. \n Why that should be, one couldn\u0027t say. The word \"tradition\" covered it all, as it covered so many things, some useful, some foolish. \n Facing them was Mandell Gruber, flanked on either side by an assistant. Gruber was trembling, his wide-opened eyes glazed. \n Hari Seldon\u0027s lips tightened. If Gruber could but manage to say, \"The Emperor\u0027s gardeners greet you all,\" that would be enough. Seldon himself would then take over. \n His eyes swept over the new contingent and he located Raych. \n His heart jumped a bit. It was the mustacheless Raych in the front row, standing more rigid than the rest, staring straight ahead. His eyes did not move to meet Seldon\u0027s; he showed no sign of recognition, however subtle. \n Good, thought Seldon. He\u0027s not supposed to. He\u0027s giving nothing away. \n Gruber muttered a weak welcome and Seldon jumped in. \n He advanced with an easy stride, putting himself immediately before Gruber, and said, \"Thank you, Gardener First-Class. Men and women, gardeners of the Emperor, you are to undertake an important task. You will be responsible for the beauty and health of the only open land on our great world of Trantor, capital of the Galactic Empire. You will see to it that if we don\u0027t have the endless vistas of open undomed worlds, we will have a small jewel here that will outshine anything else in the Empire. \n \"You will all be under Mandell Gruber, who will shortly become Chief Gardener. He will report to me, when necessary, and I will report to the Emperor. This means, as you can all see, that you will be only three levels removed from the Imperial presence and you will always be under his benign watch. I am certain that even now he is surveying us from the Small Palace, his personal home, which is the building you see to the right-the one with the opal-layered dome-and that he is pleased with what he sees. \n \"Before you start work, of course, you will all undertake a course of training that will make you entirely familiar with the grounds and its needs. You will-? \n He had, by this time, moved, almost stealthily, to a point directly in front of Raych, who still remained motionless, unblinking. \n Seldon tried not to look unnaturally benign and then a slight frown crossed his face. The person directly behind Raych looked familiar. He might have gone unrecognized if Seldon had not studied his hologram. Wasn\u0027t that Gleb Andorin of Wye? Raych\u0027s patron in Wye, in fact? What was he doing here? \n Andorin must have noticed Seldon\u0027s sudden regard, for he muttered something between scarcely opened lips and Raych\u0027s right arm, moving forward from behind his back, plucked a blaster out of the wide pocket of his green doublet. So did Andorin. \n Seldon felt himself going into near-shock. How could blasters have been allowed onto the grounds? Confused, he barely heard the cries of \"\u0027Treason!\" and the sudden noise of running and shouting. \n All that really occupied Seldon\u0027s mind was Raych\u0027s blaster pointing directly at him and Raych looking at him without any sign of recognition. Seldon抯 mind filled with horror as he realized that his son was going to shoot and that he himself was only seconds from death. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46713.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
