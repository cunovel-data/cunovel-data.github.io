How\u0027s the job?\" \\n\\n Raych said, \"Ain\u0027t much but better than nothing. Lots better. Did you tell that guy to get me one?\" \\n\\n Manella shook her head slowly. \"You mean Gleb Andorin? I didn\u0027t tell him to do anything. I just said he might be interested in you.\" \\n\\n \"Is he going to be annoyed because you and I-\" \\n\\n \"Why should he? None of his business. And none of yours, either.\" \\n\\n \"What\u0027s he do? I mean, what does he work at?\" \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think he works at anything. He\u0027s rich. He\u0027s a relative of the old Mayors.\" \\n\\n \"Of Wye?\" \\n\\n \"Right. He doesn\u0027t like the Imperial government. None of those old Mayor people do. He says Cleon should-\" \\n\\n She stopped suddenly and said, \"I\u0027m talking too much. Don\u0027t you go repeating anything I say.\" \\n\\n \"Me? I ain\u0027t heard you say nothing at all. And I ain\u0027t going to.\" \\n\\n \"All right.\" \\n\\n \"But what about Andorin? Is he high up in Joranumite business? Is tae an important guy there?\" \\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t know.\" \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t he ever talk about that kind of stuff?\" \\n\\n \"Not to me.\" \\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Raych, trying not to sound annoyed. \\n\\n Manella looked at him shrewdly. \"Why are you so interested?\" \\n\\n \"I want to get in with them. I figure I\u0027ll get higher up that way. Better job. More credits. You know.\" \\n\\n \"Maybe Andorin will help you. He likes you. I know that much.\" \\n\\n \"Could you make him like me more?\" \\n\\n \"I can try. I don\u0027t know why he shouldn\u0027t. I like you. I like you more than I like him.\" \\n\\n \"Thank you, Manella. I like you, too. -A lot.\" He ran his hand down the side of her body and wished ardently that he could concentrate more on her and less on his assignment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46659.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
