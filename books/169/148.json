I\u0027ve sent Manella and Wanda off somewhere.\" \n Dors entered, looked right and left out of sheer habit, and sat down in the nearest chair. \n \"Thanks,\" said Dors. For a while she simply sat there, looking as if the weight of the Empire were on her shoulders. \n Raych waited, then said, \"I never got a chance to ask you about your wild trip into the Palace grounds. It isn\u0027t every guy who has a mom who can do that.\" \n \"We\u0027re not talking about that, Raych.\" \n \"Well then, tell me- You\u0027re not one for giving anything away by facial expressions, but you look sorta down. Why is that?\" \n \"Because I feel, as you say, sorta down. In fact, I\u0027m in a bad mood because I have terribly important things on my mind and there\u0027s no use talking to your father about it. He\u0027s the most wonderful man in the world, but he\u0027s very hard to handle. There\u0027s no chance that he\u0027d take an interest in the dramatic. He dismisses it all as my irrational fears for his life-and my subsequent attempts to protect him.\" \n \"Come on, Mom, you do seem to have irrational fears where Dad\u0027s concerned. If you\u0027ve got something dramatic in mind, it\u0027s probably all wrong.\" \n \"Thank you. You sound just like he does and you leave me frustrated. Absolutely frustrated.\" \n \"Well then, unburden yourself, Mom. Tell me what\u0027s on your mind. From the beginning.\" \n \"It starts with Wanda\u0027s dream.\" \n \"Wanda\u0027s dream! Mom! Maybe you\u0027d better stop right now. I know that Dad won\u0027t want to listen if you start that way. I mean, come on. A little kid has a dream and you make a big deal of it. That\u0027s ridiculous.\" \n \"I don\u0027t think it was a dream, Raych. I think what she thought was a dream were two real people, talking about what she thought concerned the death of her grandfather.\" \n \"That\u0027s a wild guess on your part. What possible chance does this have of being true?\" \n \"Just suppose it is true. The one phrase that remained with her was `lemonade death.\u0027 Why should she dream that? It\u0027s much more likely that she heard that and distorted the words she heard-in which case, what were the undistorted words?\" \n \"I can\u0027t tell you,\" said Raych, his voice incredulous. \n Dors did not fail to catch that. \"You think this is just my sick invention. Still, if I happen to be right, I might be at the start of unraveling a conspiracy against Hari right here in the Project.\" \n \"Are there conspiracies in the Project? That sounds as impossible to me as finding significance in a dream.\" \n \"Every large project is riddled with angers, frictions, jealousies of all sorts.\" \n \"Sure. Sure. We\u0027re talking nasty words and faces and nose thumbing and tale bearing. That\u0027s nothing at all like talking conspiracy. It\u0027s not like talking about killing Dad.\" \n \"It\u0027s just a difference in degree. A small difference-maybe.\" \n \"You\u0027ll never make Dad believe that. For that matter, you\u0027ll never make me believe that.\" Raych walked hastily across the room and back again, \"And you\u0027ve been trying to nose out this so-called conspiracy, have you?\" \n Dors nodded. \n \"And you\u0027ve failed.\" \n Dors nodded. \n \"Doesn\u0027t it occur to you that you\u0027ve failed because there is no conspiracy, Mom?\" \n Dors shook her head. \"I\u0027ve failed so far, but that doesn\u0027t shake my belief that one exists. I have that feeling.\" \n Raych laughed. \"You sound very ordinary, Mom. I would expect more from you than `I have that feeling.\"\u0027 \n \"There is one phrase that I think can be distorted into `lemonade.\u0027 That\u0027s `layman-aided.\u0027 \" \n \"Laymanayded? What\u0027s that?\" \n \"Layman-aided. Two words. A layman is what the mathematicians at the Project call nonmathematicians.\" \n \"Well?\" \n \"Suppose,\" interjected Dors firmly, \"someone spoke of `laymanaided death,\u0027 meaning that some way could be found to kill Hari in which one or more nonmathematicians would play an essential role. Might that not have sounded to Wanda like `lemonade death,\u0027 considering that she had never heard the phrase `layman-aided\u0027 any more than you did, but that she was extraordinarily fond of lemonade?\" \n \"Are you trying to tell me that there were people in Dad\u0027s private office, of all places- How many people, by the way?\" \n \"Wanda, in describing her dream, says two. My own feeling is that one of the two was none other than Colonel Hender Linn of the junta and that he was being shown the Prime Radiant and that there must have been a discussion involving the elimination of Hari.\" \n \"You\u0027re getting wilder and wilder, Mom. Colonel Linn and another man in Dad\u0027s office talking murder and not knowing that there was a little girl hidden in a chair, overhearing them? Is that it?\" \n \"More or less.\" \n \"In that case, if there is mention of laymen, then one of the people, presumably the one that isn\u0027t Linn, must be a mathematician.\" \n \"It would seem to be so.\" \n \"That seems utterly impossible. But even if it were true, which mathematician do you suppose might be in question? There are at least fifty in ilic Project.\" \n \"I haven\u0027t questioned them all. I\u0027ve questioned a few and some laymen, too, for that matter, but I have uncovered no leads. Of course, I can\u0027t be too open in my questions.\" \n \"In short, no one you have interviewed has given you any lead on any dangerous conspiracy.\" \n \"No.\" \n \"I\u0027m not surprised. They haven\u0027t done so, because-\" \n \"I know your `because,\u0027 Raych. Do you suppose people are going to break down and give away conspiracies under mild questioning? I am in no position to try to beat the information out of anyone. Can you imagine what your father would say if I upset one of his precious mathematicians?\" \n Then, with a sudden change in the intonation of her voice, she said, \"Raych, have you talked to Yugo Amaryl lately?\" \n \"No, not recently. He\u0027s not one of your sociable creatures, you know. If you pulled the psychohistory out of him, he\u0027d collapse into a little pile of dry skin.\" \n Dors made a face at the picture and said, \"I\u0027ve talked to him twice recently and he seems to me to be a little withdrawn. I don\u0027t mean just tired. It is almost as though he\u0027s not aware of the world.\" \n \"Yes. That\u0027s Yugo.\" \n \"Is he getting worse lately?\" \n Raych thought awhile. \"He might be. He\u0027s getting older, you know. We all are. -Except you, Mom.\" \n \"Would you say that Yugo had crossed the line and become a little unstable, Raych?\" \n \"Who? Yugo? He has nothing to be unstable about. Or with. Just leave him at his psychohistory and he\u0027ll mumble quietly to himself for the rest of his life.\" \n \"I don\u0027t think so. There is something that interests him-and very strongly, too. That\u0027s the succession.\" \n \"What succession?\" \n \"I mentioned that someday your father might want to retire and it turns out that Yugo is determined-absolutely determined-to be his successor.\" \n \"I\u0027m not surprised. I imagine that everyone agrees that Yugo is the natural successor. I\u0027m sure Dad thinks so, too.\" \n \"But he seemed to me to be not quite normal about it. He thought I was coming to him to break the news that Hari had shoved him aside in favor of someone else. Can you imagine anyone thinking that of Hari?\" \n \"It is surprising-\" Raych interrupted himself and favored his mother with a long look. He said, \"Mom, are you getting ready to tell me that it might be Yugo who\u0027s at the heart of this conspiracy you\u0027re speaking of? That he wants to get rid of Dad and take over?\" \n \"Is that entirely impossible?\" \n \"Yes, it is, Mom. Entirely. If there\u0027s anything wrong with Yugo, it\u0027s overwork and nothing else. Staring at all those equations or whatever they are, all day and half the night, would drive anyone crazy.\" Dors rose to her feet with a jerk. \"You\u0027re right.\" Raych, startled, said, \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"What you\u0027ve said. It\u0027s given me an entirely new idea. A crucial one, I think.\" Turning, without another word, she left. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46805.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
