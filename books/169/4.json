{"id":4824,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"But Seldon, while he did not forget Amaryl\u0027s warning, did not think of it with any great degree of concentration. His fortieth birthday came and went-with the usual psychological blow. \\n\\n Forty! He was not young any longer. Life no longer stretched before him as a vast uncharted field, its horizon lost in the distance. He had been on Trantor for eight years and the time had passed quickly. Another eight years and he would be nearly fifty. Old age would be looming. \\n\\n And he had not even made a decent beginning in psychohistory? Yugo Amaryl spoke brightly of laws and worked out his equations by making daring assumptions based on intuition. But how could one possibly test those assumptions? Psychohistory was not yet an experimental science. The complete study of psychohistory would require experiments that would involve worlds of people, centuries of time-and a total lack of ethical responsibility. \\n\\n It posed an impossible problem and he resented having to spend any time whatever on departmental tasks, so he walked home at the end of the day in a morose mood. \\n\\n Ordinarily he could always count on a walk through the campus to rouse his spirits. Streeling University was high-domed and the campus gave the feeling of being out in the open without the necessity of enduring the kind of weather he had experienced on his one (and only) visit to the Imperial Palace. There were trees, lawns, walks, almost as though he were on the campus of his old college on his home world of Helicon. \\n\\n The illusion of cloudiness had been arranged for the day with the sunlight (no sun, of course, just sunlight) appearing and disappearing at odd intervals. And it was a little cool, just a little. \\n\\n It seemed to Seldon that the cool days came a little more frequently than they used to. Was Trantor saving energy? Was it increasing inefficiency? Or (and he scowled inwardly as he thought it) was he getting old and was his blood getting thin? He placed his hands in his jacket pockets and hunched up his shoulders. \\n\\n Usually he did not bother guiding himself consciously. His body knew the way perfectly from his offices to his computer room and from there to his apartment and back. Generally he negotiated the path with his thoughts elsewhere, but today a sound penetrated his consciousness. A sound without meaning. \\n\\n \"Jo . JJJJJJJJJJo . JJ . \" \\n\\n It was rather soft and distant, but it brought back a memory. Yes, Amaryl\u0027s warning. The demagogue. Was he here on campus? \\n\\n His legs swerved without Seldon\u0027s making a conscious decision and brought him over the low rise to the University Field, which was used for calisthenics, sports, and student oratory. \\n\\n In the middle of the Field was a moderate-sized crowd of students who were chanting enthusiastically. On a platform was someone he didn\u0027t recognize, someone with a loud voice and a swaying rhythm. \\n\\n It wasn\u0027t this man, Joranum, however. He had seen Joranum on holovision a number of times. Since Amaryl\u0027s warning, Seldon had paid close attention JJranum was large and smiled with a kind of vicious camaraderie. He had thick sandy hair and light blue eyes. \\n\\n This speaker was small, if anything-thin, wide-mouthed, dark-haired, and loud. Seldon wasn\u0027t listening to the words, though he did hear the phrase \"power from the one to the many\" and the many-voiced shout in response. \\n\\n Fine, thought Seldon, but just how does he intend to bring this about -and is he serious? \\n\\n He was at the outskirts of the crowd now and looked around far someone he knew. He spotted Finangelos, a pret-math undergraduate. Not a bad young man, dark and woolly-haired. \\n\\n \"Finangelos,\" he called out. \\n\\n \"Professor Seldon\" said Finangelos after a moment of staring as though unable to recognize Seldon without a keyboard at his fingertips he trotted over. \"Did you come to listen to this guy?\" \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t come for any purpose but to find out what the noise was. Who is he?\" \\n\\n \"His name is Namarti, Professor. He\u0027s speaking for Jo-Jo \" \\n\\n \"I hear that, \" said Seldon as he listened to the chant again It began each time the speaker made a telling point, apparently. \"But who is this Namarti? I don\u0027t recognize the name. What department is he in?\" \\n\\n \"He\u0027s not a member of the University, Professor. He\u0027s one of Jo-Jo\u0027s men \" \\n\\n \"If he\u0027s not a member of the University, he has no right to speak here without a permit. Does he have one, do you suppose?\" \\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t know, Professor \" \\n\\n \"Well then, let\u0027s find out \" \\n\\n Seldon started into the crowd, but Finangelos caught his sleeve. \"Don\u0027t start anything, Professor. He\u0027s got goons with him \" \\n\\n There were six young men behind the speaker, spaced rather widely, legs apart, arms folded, scowling. \\n\\n \"Goons?\" \\n\\n \"For rough stuff, in case anyone tries anything funny \" \\n\\n \"Then he\u0027s certainly not a member of the University and even a permit wouldn\u0027t cover what you call his `goons\u0027. -Finangelos, signal through to the University security officers. They should have been here by now without a signal \" \\n\\n \"I guess they don\u0027t want trouble,\" muttered Finangelos. \"Please, Professor, don\u0027t try anything If you want me to get the security officers, I will, but you just wait till they come \" \\n\\n \"Maybe I can break this up before they come \" \\n\\n He began pushing his way through It wasn\u0027t difficult. Some of those present recognized him and all could see the professorial shoulder patch He reached the platform, placed his hands on it, and vaulted up the three feet with a small grunt. He thought, with chagrin, that he could have done it with one hand ten years before and without the grunt. \\n\\n He straightened up. The speaker had stopped talking and was looking at him with wary and ice-hard eyes. \\n\\n Seldon said calmly, \"Your permit to address the students, sir.\" \\n\\n \"Who are you?\" said the speaker. He said it loudly, his voice carrying. \\n\\n \"I\u0027m a member of the faculty of this University,\" said Seldon, equally loudly. \"Your permit, sir?\" \\n\\n \"I deny your right to question me on the matter.\" The young men behind the speaker had gathered closer. \\n\\n \"If you have none, I would advise you to leave the University grounds immediately.\" \\n\\n \"And if I don\u0027t?\" \\n\\n \"Well, for one thing, the University security officers are on their way.\" He turned to the crowd. \"Students,\" he called out, \"we have the right of free speech and freedom of assembly on this campus, but it can be taken away from us if we allow outsiders, without permits, to make unauthorized-\" \\n\\n A heavy hand fell on his shoulder and he winced. He turned around and found it was one of the men Finangelos had referred to as \"goons.\" \\n\\n The man said, with a heavy accent whose provenance Seldon could not immediately identify, \"Get out of here fast. \" \\n\\n \"What good will that do?\" said Seldon. \"The security officers will be here any minute.\" \\n\\n \"In that case,\" said Namarti with a feral grin, \"there\u0027ll be a riot. That doesn\u0027t scare us.\" \\n\\n \"Of course it wouldn\u0027t,\" said Seldon. \"You\u0027d like it, but there won\u0027t be a riot. You\u0027ll all go quietly.\" He turned again to the students and shrugged off the hand on his shoulder. \"We\u0027ll see to that, won\u0027t we?\" \\n\\n Someone in the crowd shouted, \"That\u0027s Professor Seldon! He\u0027s all right! Don\u0027t pound him!\" \\n\\n Seldon sensed ambivalence in the crowd. There would be some, he knew, who would welcome a dust-up with the University security officers, just on general principles. On the other hand, there had to be some who liked him personally and still others who did not know him but who would not want to see violence against a member of the faculty. \\n\\n A woman\u0027s voice rang out. \"Watch out, Professor!\" \\n\\n Seldon sighed and regarded the large young men he faced. He didn\u0027t know if he could do it, if his reflexes were quick enough, his muscles sturdy enough, even given his prowess at Twisting. \\n\\n One goon was approaching him, overconfidently of course. Not quickly, which gave Seldon a little of the time his aging body would need. The goon held out his arm confrontationally, which made it easier. \\n\\n Seldon seized the arm, whirled, and bent, arm up, and then down (with a grunt why did he have to grunt?), and the goon went flying through the air, propelled partly by his own momentum. He landed with a thump on the outer edge of the platform, his right shoulder dislocated. \\n\\n There was a wild cry from the audience at this totally unexpected development. Instantly an institutional pride erupted. \\n\\n \"Take them, Prof!\" a lone voice shouted. Others took up the cry. \\n\\n Seldon smoothed back his hair, trying not to puff. With his foot he shoved the groaning fallen goon off the platform. \\n\\n \"Anyone else?\" he asked pleasantly. \"Or will you leave quietly?\" \\n\\n He faced Namarti and his five henchmen and as they paused irresolutely, Seldon said, \"I warn you. The crowd is on my side now. If you try to rush me, they\u0027ll take you apart. -Okay, who\u0027s next? Let\u0027s go. One at a time.\" \\n\\n He had raised his voice with the last sentence and made small come-hither motions with his fingers. The crowd yelled its pleasure. \\n\\n Namarti stood there stolidly. Seldon leaped past him and caught his neck in the crook of his arm. Students were climbing onto the platform now, shouting \"One at a time! One at a time!\" and getting between the bodyguards and Seldon. \\n\\n Seldon increased the pressure on the other\u0027s windpipe and whispered in his ear, \"There\u0027s a way to do this, Namarti, and I know how: I\u0027ve practiced it for years. If you make a move and try to break away, I\u0027ll ruin your larynx so that you\u0027ll never talk above a whisper again. If you value your voice, do as I say. When I let up, you tell your bunch of bullies to leave. If you say anything else, they\u0027ll be the last words you\u0027ll say normally. And if you ever come back to this campus again, no more Mr. Nice Guy. I\u0027ll finish the job.\" \\n\\n He released the pressure momentarily. Namarti said huskily, \"All of you. Get out.\" They retreated rapidly, helping their stricken comrade. \\n\\n When the University security officers arrived a few moments later, Seldon said, \"Sorry, gentlemen. False alarm.\" \\n\\n He left the Field and resumed his walk home with more than a little chagrin. He had revealed a side of himself he did not want to reveal. He was Hari Seldon, mathematician, not Hari Seldon, sadistic twister. \\n\\n Besides, he thought gloomily, Dors would hear of this. In fact, he\u0027d better tell her himself, lest she hear a version that made the incident seem worse than it really was. \\n\\n She would not be pleased. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46510.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
