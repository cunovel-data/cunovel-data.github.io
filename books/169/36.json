{"id":4856,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"Raych sat in the anteroom of a public building in Dahl into which he had never ventured-never could have ventured-as a ragamuffin youth. He felt, in all truth, a little uneasy about it now, as though he were trespassing. \\n\\n He tried to look calm, trustworthy, lovable. \\n\\n Dad had told him that this was a quality he carried around with him, but he had never been conscious of it. If it came about naturally, he would probably spoil it by trying too hard to seem to be what he really was. \\n\\n He tried relaxing while keeping an eye on the official who was manipulating a computer at the desk. The official was not a Dahlite. He was, in fact, Gambol Deen Namarti, who had been with Joranum at the meeting with Dad that Raych had attended. \\n\\n Every once in a while, Namarti would look up from his desk and glance at Raych with a hostile glare. This Namarti wasn\u0027t buying Raych\u0027s lovability. Raych could see that. \\n\\n Raych did not try to meet Namarti\u0027s hostility with a friendly smile. It would have seemed too artificial. He simply waited. He had gotten this far. If Joranum arrived, as he was expected to, Raych would have a chance to speak to him. \\n\\n Joranum did arrive, sweeping in, smiling his public smile of warmth and confidence. Namarti\u0027s hand came up and Joranum stopped. They spoke together in low voices while Raych watched intently and tried in vain to seem as if he wasn\u0027t. It seemed plain to Raych that Namarti was arguing against the meeting and Raych bridled a bit at that. \\n\\n Then Joranum looked at Raych, smiled, and pushed Namarti to one side. It occurred to Raych that, while Namarti was the brains of the team, it was Joranum who clearly had the charisma. \\n\\n Joranum strode toward him and held out a plump, slightly moist hand. \"Well well. Professor Seldon\u0027s young man. How are you?\" \\n\\n \"Fine, thank you, sir.\" \\n\\n \"You had some trouble getting here, I understand.\" \\n\\n \"Not too much, sir.\" \\n\\n \"And you\u0027ve come with a message from your father, I trust. I hope he is reconsidering his decision and has decided to join me in my great crusade.\" \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so, sir.\" \\n\\n Joranum frowned slightly. \"Are you here without his knowledge?\" \\n\\n \"No, sir. He sent me.\" \\n\\n \"I see. -Are you hungry, lad?\" \\n\\n \"Not at the moment, sir.\" \\n\\n \"Then would you mind if I eat? I don\u0027t get much time for the ordinary amenities of life,\" he said, smiling broadly. \\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right with me, sir.\" \\n\\n Together, they moved to a table and sat down. Joranum unwrapped a sandwich and took a bite. His voice slightly muffled, he said, \"And why did he send you, son?\" \\n\\n Raych shrugged. \"I think he thought I might find out something about you that he could use against you. He\u0027s heart and soul with First Minister Demerzel.\" \\n\\n \"And you\u0027re not?\" \\n\\n \"No, sir. I\u0027m a Dahlite.\" \\n\\n \"I know you are, Mr. Seldon, but what does that mean?\" \\n\\n \"It means I\u0027m oppressed, so I\u0027m on your side and I want to help you. Of course, I wouldn\u0027t want my father to know.\" \\n\\n \"There\u0027s no reason he should know. How do you propose to help me?\" He glanced quickly at Namarti, who was leaning against his desk, listening, with his arms folded and his expression lowering. \"Do you know anything about psychohistory?\" \\n\\n \"No, sir. My father don\u0027t talk to me about that-and if he did, I wouldn\u0027t get it. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s getting anywhere with that stuff.\" \\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" \\n\\n \"Sure I\u0027m sure. There\u0027s a guy there, Yugo Amaryl, also a Dahlite, who talks about it sometimes. I\u0027m sure nothing is happening.\" \\n\\n \"Ah! And can I see Yugo Amaryl sometime, do you suppose?\" \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so. He ain\u0027t much for Demerzel, but he\u0027s all for my father. He wouldn\u0027t cross him.\" \\n\\n \"But you would?\" \\n\\n Raych looked unhappy and he muttered stubbornly, \"I\u0027m a Dahlite.\" \\n\\n Joranum cleared his throat. \"Then let me ask you again. How do you propose to help me, young man?\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got something to tell you that maybe you won\u0027t believe.\" \\n\\n \"Indeed? Try me. If I don\u0027t believe it, I will tell you so.\" \\n\\n \"It\u0027s about First Minister Eto Demerzel.\" \\n\\n \"Well?\" \\n\\n Raych looked around uneasily. \"Can anyone hear me?\" \\n\\n \"Just Namarti and myself.\" \\n\\n \"All right, then listen. This guy Demerzel ain\u0027t a guy. He\u0027s a robot.\" \\n\\n \"What!\" exploded Joranum. \\n\\n Raych felt moved to explain. \"A robot is a mechanical man, sir. He ain\u0027t human. He\u0027s a machine.\" \\n\\n Namarti broke out passionately, \"Jo-Jo, don\u0027t believe that. It\u0027s ridiculous.\" \\n\\n But Joranum held up an admonitory hand. His eyes were gleaming. \"Why do you say that?\" \\n\\n \"My father was in Mycogen once. He told me all about it. In Mycogen they talk about robots a lot.\" \\n\\n \"Yes, I know. At least, I have heard so.\" \\n\\n \"The Mycogenians believe that robots were once very common among their ancestors, but they were wiped out.\" \\n\\n Namarti\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"But what makes you think that Demerzel is a robot? From what little I have heard of these fantasies, robots are made out of metal, aren\u0027t they?\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s so,\" said Raych earnestly. \"But what I heard is that there were a few robots that look just like human beings and they live forever-\" \\n\\n Namarti shook his head violently. \"Legends! Ridiculous legends! JoJo, why are we listening-\" \\n\\n But Joranum cut him off quickly. \"No, G.D. I want to listen. I\u0027ve heard these legends, too.\" \\n\\n \"But it\u0027s nonsense, Jo-Jo.\" \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be in such a rush to say `nonsense.\u0027 And even if it were, people live and die by nonsense. It\u0027s not what is so much as what people think is. -Tell me, young man, putting legends to one side, what makes you think Demerzel is a robot? Let\u0027s suppose that robots exist. What is it, then, about Demerzel that makes you say he is a robot? Did he tell you so?\" \\n\\n \"No, sir,\" said Raych. \\n\\n \"Did your father tell you so?\" asked Joranum. \\n\\n \"No, sir. It\u0027s just my own idea, but I\u0027m sure of it.\" \\n\\n \"Why? What makes you so sure?\" \\n\\n \"It\u0027s just something about him. He doesn\u0027t change. He doesn\u0027t get older. He doesn\u0027t show emotions. Something about him looks like he\u0027s made of metal.\" \\n\\n Joranum sat back in his chair and looked at Raych for an extended time. It was almost possible to hear his thoughts buzzing. \\n\\n Finally he said, \"Suppose he is a robot, young man. Why should you care? Does it matter to you?\" \\n\\n \"Of course it matters to me,\" said Raych. \"I\u0027m a human being. I don\u0027t want no robot in charge of running the Empire.\" \\n\\n Joranum turned to Namarti with a gesture of eager approval. \"Do you hear that, G.D.? `I\u0027m a human being. I don\u0027t want no robot in charge of running the Empire.\u0027 Put him on holovision and have him say it. Have him repeat it over and over till it\u0027s drummed into every person on Trantor-\" \\n\\n \"Hey,\" said Raych, finally catching his breath. \"I can\u0027t say that on holovision. I can\u0027t let my father find out-\" \\n\\n \"No, of course not,\" said Joranum quickly. \"We couldn\u0027t allow that. We\u0027ll just use the words. We\u0027ll find some other Dahlite. Someone from each of the sectors, each in his own dialect, but always the same message: `I don\u0027t want no robot in charge of running the Empire.\u0027\" \\n\\n Namarti said, \"And what happens when Demerzel proves he\u0027s not a robot?\" \\n\\n \"Really,\" said Joranum. \"How will he do that? It would be impossible for him to do so. Psychologically impossible. What? The great Demerzel, the power behind the throne, the man who has twitched the strings attached to Cleon I all these years and those attached to Cleon抯 father before him? Will he climb down now and whine to the public that he is, too, a human being? That would be almost as destructive to him as being a robot. G.D., we have the villain in a no-win situation and we owe it all to this fine young man here.\" \\n\\n Raych flushed. \\n\\n Joranum said, \"Raych is your name, isn\u0027t it? Once our party is in a position to do so, we won\u0027t forget. Dahl will be treated well and you will have a good position with us. You\u0027re going to be Dahl\u0027s sector leader someday, Raych, and you\u0027re not going to regret you\u0027ve done this. Are you, now?\" \\n\\n \"Not on your life,\" said Raych fervently. \\n\\n \"In that case, we\u0027ll see that you get back to your father. You let him know that we intend him no harm, that we value him greatly. You can tell him you found that out in any way you please. And if you find anything else you think we might be able to use-about psychohistory, in particular, you let us know.\" \\n\\n \"You bet. But do you mean it when you say you\u0027ll see to it that Dahl gets some breaks?\" \\n\\n \"Absolutely. Equality of sectors, my boy. Equality of worlds. We\u0027ll have a new Empire with all the old villainies of privilege and inequality wiped out.\" \\n\\n And Raych nodded his head vigorously. \"That\u0027s what I want.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46542.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
