{"id":4924,"no":104,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"Wanda was almost eight years old now, going by Galactic Standard Time -as everyone did. She was quite the little lady-grave in manner, with straight light-brown hair. Her eyes were blue but were darkening and she might well end with the brown eyes of her father. She sat there, lost in thought. -Sixty. That was the number that preoccupied her. Grandfather was going to have a birthday and it was going to be his sixtieth-and sixty was a large number. It bothered her because yesterday she had had a bad dream about it. She went in search of her mother. She would have to ask. Her mother was not hard to find. She was talking to Grandfather-about the birthday surely. Wanda hesitated. It wouldn\u0027t be nice to ask in front of Grandfather. Her mother had no trouble whatever sensing Wanda\u0027s consternation. She said, \"One minute, Hari, and let\u0027s see what\u0027s bothering Wanda. What is it, dear?\" Wanda pulled at her hand. \"Not here, Mother. Private.\" Manella turned to Hari Seldon. \"See how early it starts? Private lives. Private problems. Of course, Wanda, shall we go to your room?\" \"Yes, Mother.\" Wanda was clearly relieved. Hand in hand, they went and then her mother said, \"Now what is the problem, Wanda?\" \"It\u0027s Grandfather, Mother.\" \"Grandfather! I can\u0027t imagine him doing anything to bother you.\" \"Well, he is.\" Wanda\u0027s eyes filled with sudden tears. \"Is he going to die?\" \"Your grandfather? What put that into your head, Wanda?\" \"He\u0027s going to be sixty. That\u0027s so old.\" \"No, it isn\u0027t. It\u0027s not young, but it\u0027s not old, either. People live to be eighty, ninety, even a hundred-and your grandfather is strong and healthy. He\u0027ll live a long time.\" \"Are you sure?\" She was sniffing. Manella grasped her daughter by the shoulders and looked her straight in the eyes. \"We must all die someday, Wanda. I\u0027ve explained that to you before. Just the same, we don\u0027t worry about it till the someday is much closer.\" She wiped Wanda\u0027s eyes gently. \"Grandfather is going to stay alive till you\u0027re all grown up and have babies of your own. You\u0027ll see. Now come back with me. I want you to talk to Grandfather.\" Wanda sniffed again. Seldon looked at the little girl with a sympathetic expression on her return and said, \"What is it, Wanda? Why are you unhappy?\" Wanda shook her head. Seldon turned his gaze to the girl\u0027s mother. \"Well, what is it, Manella?\" Manella shook her head. \"She\u0027ll have to tell you herself.\" Seldon sat down and tapped his lap. \"Come, Wanda. Have a seat and tell me your troubles.\" She obeyed and wriggled a bit, then said, \"I\u0027m scared.\" Seldon put his arm around her. \"Nothing to be scared of in your old grandfather.\" Manella made a face. \"Wrong word.\" Seldon looked up at her. \"Grandfather?\" \"No. Old.\" That seemed to break the dike. Wanda burst into tears. \"You\u0027re old, Grandfather.\" \"I suppose so. I\u0027m sixty.\" He bent his face down to Wanda\u0027s and whispered, \"I don\u0027t like it, either, Wanda. That\u0027s why I\u0027m glad you\u0027re only seven going on eight.\" \"Your hair is white, Grandpa.\" \"It wasn\u0027t always. It just turned white recently.\" \"White hair means you\u0027re going to die, Grandpa.\" Seldon looked shocked. He said to Manella, \"What is all this?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Hari. It\u0027s her own idea.\" \"I had a bad dream,\" said Wanda. Seldon cleared his throat. \"We all have bad dreams now and then, Wanda. It\u0027s good we do. Bad dreams get rid of bad thoughts and then we\u0027re better off.\" \"It was about you dying, Grandfather.\" \"I know. I know. Dreams can be about dying, but that doesn\u0027t make them important. Look at me. Don\u0027t you see how alive I am-and cheerful-and laughing? Do I look as though I\u0027m dying? Tell me.\" \"N-no.\" \"There you are, then. Now you go out and play and forget all about this. I\u0027m just having a birthday and everyone will have a good time. Go ahead, dear.\" Wanda left in reasonable cheer, but Seldon motioned to Manella to stay.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46719.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
