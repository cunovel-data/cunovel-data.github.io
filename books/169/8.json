{"id":4828,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"There was a short silence again, but only because thoughts are silent. Seldon\u0027s were tumultuous enough. \n Yes, it was true. His wife did seem to have an uncanny knowledge of robots. Hari had wondered about this so often over the years that he had finally given up, tucked it away in the back of his mind. If it hadn\u0027t been for Eto Demerzel-a robot-Hari would never have met Dors. For Dors worked for Demerzel; it was Demerzel who \"assigned\" Dors to Hari\u0027s case eight years ago to protect him during his flight throughout the various sectors of Trantor. Even though now she was his wife, his help-meet, his \"\u0027better half,\" Hari still occasionally wondered about Dors\u0027s strange connection with the robot Demerzel. It was the only area of Dors\u0027s life where Hari truly felt he did not belong-nor welcome. And that brought to mind the most painful question of all: Was it out of obedience to Demerzel that Dors stayed with Hari or was it out of love for him? He wanted to believe the latter-and yet . \n His life with Dors Venabili was a happy one, but it was so at a cost, at a condition. The condition was all the more stringent, in that it had been settled not through discussion or agreement but by a mutual unspoken understanding. \n Seldon understood that he found in Dors everything he would have wanted in a wife. True, he had no children, but he had neither expected any, nor, to tell the truth, had greatly wanted any. He had Raych, who was as much a son of his emotionally as if he had inherited the entire Seldonian genome-perhaps more so. \n The mere fact that Dors was causing him to think about the matter was breaking the agreement that had kept them in peace and comfort all these years and he felt a faint but growing resentment at that. \n But he pushed those thoughts, the questions, away again. He had learned to accept her role as his protector and would continue to do so. After all, it was he with whom she shared a home, a table, and a bed-not Eto Demerzel. \n Dors\u0027s voice brought him out of his reverie. \n \"I said- Are you sulking, Hari?\" \n He started slightly, for there was the sound of repetition in her voice, and he realized he had been shrinking steadily deeper into his mind and away from her. \n \"I\u0027m sorry, dear. I\u0027m not sulking. -Not deliberately sulking. I\u0027m just wondering how I ought to respond to your statement.\" \n \"About robots?\" She seemed quite calm as she said the word. \n \"You said I don\u0027t know as much about them as you do. How do I respond to that?\" He paused, then added quietly (knowing he was taking a chance), \"That is, without offense.\" \n \"I didn\u0027t say you didn\u0027t know about robots. If you\u0027re going to quote me, do so with precision. I said you didn\u0027t understand about robots. I\u0027m sure that you know a great deal, perhaps more than I do, but to know is not necessarily to understand.\" \n \"Now, Dors, you\u0027re deliberately speaking in paradoxes to be annoying. A paradox arises only out of an ambiguity that deceives either unwittingly or by design. I don\u0027t like that in science and I don\u0027t like it in casual conversation, either, unless it is meant humorously, which I think is not the case now.\" \n Dors laughed in her particular way, softly, almost as though amusement were too precious to be shared in an overliberal manner. \"Apparently the paradox has annoyed you into pomposity and you are always humorous when you are pompous. However, I\u0027ll explain. It\u0027s not my intention to annoy you.\" She reached over to pat his hand and it was to Seldon\u0027s surprise (and slight embarrassment) that he found that he had clenched his hand into a fist. \n Dors said, \"You talk about psychohistory a great deal. To me, at any rate. You know that?\" \n Seldon cleared his throat. \"I throw myself on your mercy as far as that\u0027s concerned. The project is secret-by its very nature. Psychohistory won\u0027t work unless the people it affects know nothing about it, so I can talk about it only to Yugo and to you. To Yugo, it is all intuition. He\u0027s brilliant, but he is so apt to leap wildly into darkness that I must play the role of caution, of forever pulling him back. But I have my wild thoughts, too, and it helps me to be able to hear them aloud, even\"-and he smiled- \"when I have a pretty good notion that you don\u0027t understand a word I\u0027m saying.\" \n \"I know I\u0027m your sounding board and I don\u0027t mind. -I really don\u0027t mind, Hari, so don\u0027t begin making inner resolutions to change your behavior. Naturally I don\u0027t understand your mathematics. I\u0027m just a historian-and not even a historian of science. The influence of economic change on political development is what is taking up my time now-\" \n \"Yes, and I\u0027m your sounding board on that or hadn\u0027t you noticed? I\u0027ll need it for psychohistory when the time comes, so I suspect you\u0027ll be an indispensable help to me.\" \n \"Good! Now that we\u0027ve settled why you stay with me-I knew it couldn\u0027t be for my ethereal beauty-let me go on to explain that occasionally, when your discussion veers away from the strictly mathematical aspects, it seems to me that I get your drift. You have, on a number of occasions, explained what you call the necessity of minimalism. I think I understand that. By it, you mean-\" \n \"I know what I mean.\" \n Dors looked hurt. \"Less lofty, please, Hari. I\u0027m not trying to explain to you. I want to explain it to myself. You say you\u0027re my sounding board, so act like one. Turnabout is fair play, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \"Turnabout is fine, but if you\u0027re going to accuse me of loftiness when I say one little-\" \n ``Enough! Shut up! -You have told me that minimalism is of the highest importance in applied psychohistory; in the art of attempting to change an undesired development into a desired one or, at any rate, a toss undesired one. You have said that a change must be applied that is as minute, as minimal, as possible-\" \n \"Yes,\" said Seldon eagerly, \"that is because-\" \n \"No, Hari. I\u0027m trying to explain. We both know that you understand it. You must have minimalism because every change, any change, has a myriad of side effects that can\u0027t always be allowed for. If the change is side effects too many, then it becomes certain that the outcome will be far removed from anything you\u0027ve planned and that it would be entirely unpredictable.\" \n \"Right,\" said Seldon. \"That\u0027s the essence of a chaotic- effect. The problem is whether any change is small enough to make the consequence reasonably predictable or whether human history is inevitably and unalterably chaotic in every respect. It was that which, at the start, made me think that psychohistory was not-\" \n \"I know, but you\u0027re not letting me make my point. Whether any change would be small enough is not the issue. The point is that any change greater than the minimal is chaotic. The required minimum may be zero, but if it is not zero, then it is still very small-and it would be a major problem to find some change that is small enough and yet is significantly greater than zero. Now, that, I gather, is what you mean by the necessity of minimalism.\" \n \"More or less,\" said Seldon. \"Of course, as always, the matter is expressed more compactly and more rigorously in the language of mathematics. See here-\" \n \"Save me,\" said Dors. \"Since you know this about psychohistory, Hari, you ought to know it about Demerzel, too. You have the knowledge but not the understanding, because it apparently doesn\u0027t occur to you to apply the rules of psychohistory to the Laws of Robotics.\" \n To which Seldon replied faintly, \"Now I don\u0027t see what you\u0027re getting at. \n \"He requires minimality, too, doesn\u0027t he, Hari? By the First Law of Robotics, a robot can\u0027t harm a human being. That is the prime rule for the usual robot, but Demerzel is something quite unusual and for him, the Zeroth Law is a reality and it takes precedence even over the First Law. The Zeroth Law states that a robot can\u0027t harm humanity as a whole. But that puts Demerzel into the same bind in which you exist when you labor at psychohistory. Do you see?\" \n \"I\u0027m beginning to.\" \n \"I hope so. If Demerzel has the ability to change minds, he has to do so without bringing about side effects he does not wish-and since he is the Emperor\u0027s First Minister, the side effects he must worry about are numerous, indeed.\" \n \"And the application to the present case?\" \n \"Think about it! You can\u0027t tell anyone-except me, of course-that Demerzel is a robot, because he has adjusted you so that you can\u0027t. But how much adjustment did that take? Do you want to tell people that he is a robot? Do you want to ruin his effectiveness when you depend on him for protection, for support of your grants, for influence quietly exerted on your behalf? Of course not. The change he had to make then was a very tiny one, just enough to keep you from blurting it out in a moment of excitement or carelessness. It is so small a change that there are no particular side effects. That is how Demerzel tries to run the Empire generally.\" \n \"And the case of Joranum?\" \n \"Is obviously completely different from yours. He is, for whatever motives, unalterably opposed to Demerzel. Undoubtedly, Demerzel could change that, but it would be at the price of introducing a considerable wrench in Joranum\u0027s makeup that would bring about results Demerzel could not predict. Rather than take the chance of harming Joranum, of producing side effects that would harm others and, possibly, all of humanity, he must leave Joranum alone until he can find some small change-some small change-that will save the situation without harm. That is why Yugo is right and why Demerzel is vulnerable.\" \n Seldon had listened but did not respond. He seemed lost in thought. Minutes passed before he said, \"If Demerzel can do nothing in this matter, then I must.\" \n \"If he can do nothing, what can you do?\" \n \"The case is different. I am not bound by the Laws of Robotics. I need not concern myself obsessively with minimalism. -And to begin with, I must see Demerzel.\" \n Dors looked faintly anxious. \"Must you? Surely it wouldn\u0027t be wise to advertise a connection between the two of you.\" \n \"We have reached a time where we can\u0027t make a fetish of pretending there is no connection. Naturally I won\u0027t go to see him behind a flourish of trumpets and an announcement on holovision, but I must see him.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46514.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
