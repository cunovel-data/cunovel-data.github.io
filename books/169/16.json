{"id":4836,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"Raych looked at Hari Seldon after the two politicians had gone and fingered his mustache. It gave him satisfaction to stroke it. Here in the Streeling Sector, some men wore mustaches, but they were usually thin despicable things of uncertain color-thin despicable things, even if dark. Most men did not wear them at all and suffered with naked upper lips. Seldon didn\u0027t, for instance, and that was just as well. With his color of hair, a mustache would have been a travesty. \n He watched Seldon closely, waiting for him to cease being lost in thought, and then found he could wait no longer. \n \"Dad?\" he said. \n Seldon looked up and said, \"What?\" He sounded a little annoyed at having his thoughts interrupted, Raych decided. \n Raych said, \"I don\u0027t think it was right for you to see those two guys.\" \n \"Oh? Why not?\" \n \"Well, the thin guy, whatever his name is, was the guy you made trouble for at the Field. He can\u0027t have liked it.\" \n \"But he apologized.\" \n \"He didn\u0027t mean it. But the other guy, Joranum-he can be dangerous. What if they had had weapons?\" \n \"What? Here in the University? In my office? Of course not. This isn\u0027t Billibotton. Besides, if they had tried anything, I could have handled both of them together. Easily.\" \n \"I don\u0027t know, Dad,\" said Raych dubiously. \"You\u0027re getting-\" \n \"Don\u0027t say it, you ungrateful monster,\" said Seldon, lifting an admonishing finger. `You\u0027ll sound just like your mother and I have enough of that from her. I am not getting old-or, at least, not that old. Besides, you were with me and you\u0027re almost as skilled a Twister as I am.\" \n Raych\u0027s nose wrinkled. \"Twisting ain\u0027t much good.\" (It was no use. Raych heard himself speak and knew that, even eight years out of the morass of Dahl, he still slipped into using the Dahlite accent that marked him firmly as a member of the lower class. And he was short, too, to the point where he sometimes felt stunted. -But he had his mustache and no one ever patronized him twice.) \n He said, \"What are you going to do about Joranum?\" \n \"For now, nothing.\" \n \"Well, look, Dad, I saw Joranum on TrantorVision a couple of times. I even made some holotapes of his speeches. -Everyone is talking about him, so I thought I would see what he has to say. And, you know, he makes some kind of sense. I don\u0027t like him and I don\u0027t trust him, but he does make some kind of sense. He wants all sectors to have equal rights and equal opportunities-and there ain\u0027t nothing wrong with that, is there?\" \n \"Certainly not. All civilized people feel that way.\" \n \"So why don\u0027t we have that sort of stuff? Does the Emperor feel that way? Does Demerzel?\" \n \"The Emperor and the First Minister have an entire Empire to worry about. They can\u0027t concentrate all their efforts on Trantor itself. It\u0027s easy for Joranum to talk about equality. He has no responsibilities. If he were in the position to rule, he would find that his efforts would be greatly diluted by an Empire of twenty-five million planets. Not only that, but he would find himself stopped at every point by the sectors themselves. Each one wants a great deal of equality for itself-but not much equality for others. Tell me, Raych, are you of the opinion that Joranum ought to have a chance to rule, just to show what he can do?\" \n Raych shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. I wonder. -But if he had tried anything on you, I would have been at his throat before he could move two centimeters.\" \n \"Your loyalty to me, then, exceeds your concern for the Empire.\" \n \"Sure. You\u0027re my dad.\" \n Seldon looked at Raych fondly, but behind that look he felt a trace of uncertainty. How far could Joranum\u0027s nearly hypnotic influence go? \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46522.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
