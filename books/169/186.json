{"id":5006,"no":186,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"They were back at Streeling now and Seldon\u0027s leg was stretched out on a hassock. \n Raych looked at him somberly. \"Dad,\" he began, \"you\u0027re not to go walking around Trantor on your own from now on.\" \n Seldon frowned. \"Why, because of one incident?\" \n \"It was enough of an incident. You can\u0027t take care of yourself any longer. You\u0027re seventy years old and your right leg will not support you in an emergency. And you have enemies-\" \n \"Enemies!\" \n \"Yes, indeed. And you know it. Those sewer rats were not after simply anyone. They were not looking for just any unwary person to rip off. They identified you by calling out, `Psychohistory!\u0027 And they called you a creep. Why do you suppose that was?\" \n \"I don\u0027t know why.\" \n \"That\u0027s because you live in a world all your own, Dad, and you don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on on Trantor. Don\u0027t you suppose the Trantorians know that their world is going downhill at a rapid rate? Don\u0027t you suppose they know that your psychohistory has been predicting this for years? Doesn\u0027t it occur to you that they may blame the messenger for the message? If things go bad-and they are going bad-there are many who think that you are responsible for it.\" \n \"I can\u0027t believe that.\" \n \"Why do you suppose there\u0027s a faction at the Galactic Library that wants you out of there? They don\u0027t want to be in the way when you are mobbed. So-you\u0027ve got to take care of yourself. You can\u0027t go out alone. I\u0027ll have to be with you or you will have to have bodyguards. That\u0027s the way it\u0027s going to be, Dad.\" \n Seldon looked dreadfully unhappy. \n Raych softened and said, \"But not for long, Dad. I\u0027ve got a new job.\u0027 \n Seldon looked up. \"A new job. What kind?\" \n \"Teaching. At a University.\u0027 \"Which University?\" \"Santanni.\" \n Seldon\u0027s lips trembled. \"Santanni! That\u0027s nine thousand parsecs away from Trantor. It\u0027s a provincial world on the other side of the Galaxy.\" \n \"Exactly. That\u0027s why I want to go there. I\u0027ve been on Trantor all my life, Dad, and I\u0027m tired of it. There\u0027s no world in all the Empire that\u0027s deteriorating the way Trantor is. It\u0027s become a haunt of crime with no one to protect us. The economy is limping, the technology is failing. Santanni, on the other hand, is a decent world, still humming along, and I want to be there to build a new life, along with Manella and Wanda and Bellis. We\u0027re all going there in two months.\" \n \"All of you!\" \n \"And you, Dad. And you. We wouldn\u0027t leave you behind on Trantor. You\u0027re coming with us to Santanni.\" \n Seldon shook his head. \"Impossible, Raych. You know that.\" \n \"Why impossible?\" \n \"You know why. The Project. My psychohistory. Are you asking me to abandon my life\u0027s work?\" \n \"Why not? It\u0027s abandoned you.\" \n \"You\u0027re mad.\" \n \"No, I\u0027m not. Where are you going with it? You have no credits. You can\u0027t get any. There\u0027s no one left on Trantor who\u0027s willing to support you.\" \n \"For nearly forty years-\" \n \"Yes, I admit that. But after all that time, you\u0027ve failed Dad. There\u0027s no crime in failing. You\u0027ve tried so hard and you\u0027ve gone so far, but you\u0027ve run into a deteriorating economy, a falling Empire. It\u0027s the very thing you\u0027ve been predicting for so long that\u0027s stopping you at last. So-\" \n \"No. I will not stop. Somehow or other, I will keep going.\" \n \"I tell you what, Dad. If you\u0027re really going to be so stubborn, then take psychohistory with you. Start it again on Santanni. There may be enough credits-and enthusiasm-to support it there.\" \n \"And the men and women who have been working for me so faithfully?\" \n \"Oh bull, Dad. They\u0027ve been leaving you because you can\u0027t pay them. You hang around here for the rest of your life and you\u0027ll be alone. -Oh, come on, Dad. Do you think I like to talk to you this way? It\u0027s because no one has wanted to-because no one has had the heart to-that you\u0027re in your present predicament. Let\u0027s be honest with each other now. When ~. 剈 walk the streets of Trantor and you\u0027re attacked for no reason other than that you\u0027re Hari Seldon, don\u0027t you think it\u0027s time for a little bit of truth?\" \n \"Never mind the truth. I have no intention of leaving Trantor.\" \n Raych shook his head. \"I was sure you\u0027d be stubborn, Dad. You\u0027ve got two months to change your mind. Think about it, will you?\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46914.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
