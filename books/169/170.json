{"id":4990,"no":170,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"It was not an easy task to obtain a complete genome of Wanda. To begin with, the number of biophysicists equipped to handle the genome was small and those that existed were always busy. \\n\\n Nor was it possible for Seldon to discuss his needs openly, in order to interest the biophysicists. It was absolutely essential, Seldon felt, that the true reason for his interest in Wanda\u0027s mental powers be kept secret from all the Galaxy. \\n\\n And if another difficulty was needed, it was the fact that the process was infernally expensive. \\n\\n Seldon shook his head and said to Mian Endelecki, the biophysicist he was now consulting, \"Why so expensive, Dr. Endelecki? I am not an expert in the field, but it is my distinct understanding that the process is completely computerized and that, once you have a scraping of skin cells, the genome can be completely built and analyzed in a matter of days.\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s true. But having a deoxyribonucleic acid molecule stretching out for billions of nucleotides, with every puring and pyrimidine in its place, is the least of it; the very least of it, Professor Seldon. There is then the matter of studying each one and comparing it to some standard. \\n\\n \"Now, consider, in the first place, that although we have records of complete genomes, they represent a vanishingly small fraction of the number of genomes that exist, so that we don\u0027t really know how standard they are.\" \\n\\n Seldon asked, \"Why so few?\" \\n\\n \"A number of reasons. The expense, for one thing. Few people are willing to spend the credits on it unless they have strong reason to think there is something wrong with their genome. And if they have no strong reason, they are reluctant to undergo analysis for fear they will find something wrong. Now, then, are you sure you want your granddaughter genomed?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, I do. It is terribly important.\" \\n\\n \"Why? Does she show signs of a metabolic anomaly?\" \\n\\n \"No, she doesn\u0027t. Rather the reverse-if I knew the antonym of \u0027anomaly.\u0027 I consider her a most unusual person and I want to know just what it is that makes her unusual.\" \\n\\n \"Unusual in what way?\" \\n\\n \"Mentally, but it\u0027s impossible for me to go into details, since I don\u0027t entirely understand it. Maybe I will, once she is genomed.\" \\n\\n \"How old is she?\" \\n\\n \"Twelve. She\u0027ll soon be thirteen.\" \\n\\n \"In that case, I\u0027ll need permission from her parents.\" \\n\\n Seldon cleared his throat. \"That may be difficult to get. I\u0027m her grandfather. Wouldn\u0027t my permission be enough?\" \\n\\n \"For me, certainly. But, you know, we\u0027re talking about the law. I don抰 wish to lose my license to practice.\" \\n\\n It was necessary for Seldon to approach Raych again. This, too, was difficult, as he protested once more that he and his wife, Manella, wanted Wanda to live a normal life of a normal girl. What if her genome did turn out to be abnormal? Would she be whisked away to be prodded and probed like a laboratory specimen? Would Hari, in his fanatical devotion to his Psychohistory Project, press Wanda into a life of all work and no play, shutting her off from other young people her age? But Seldon was insistent. \\n\\n \"Trust me, Raych. I would never do anything to harm Wanda. But this must be done. I need to know Wanda\u0027s genome. If it is as I suspect it is, we may be on the verge of altering the course of psychohistory, of the future of the Galaxy itself!\" \\n\\n And so Raych was persuaded and somehow he obtained Manella\u0027s consent, as well. And together, the three adults took Wanda to Dr. Endelecki\u0027s office. \\n\\n Mian Endelecki greeted them at the door. Her hair was a shining white, but her face showed no sign of age. \\n\\n She looked at the girl, who walked in with a look of curiosity on her face but with no signs of apprehension or fear. She then turned her gaze to the three adults who had accompanied Wanda. \\n\\n Dr. Endelecki said with a smile, \"Mother, father, and grandfather-am I right?\" \\n\\n Seldon answered, \"Absolutely right.\" \\n\\n Raych looked hang-dog and Manella, her face a little swollen and her eyes a little red, looked tired. \\n\\n \"Wanda,\" began the doctor. \"That is your name, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" said Wanda in her clear voice. \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to tell you exactly what I\u0027m going to do with you. You\u0027re right-handed, I suppose.\" \\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \\n\\n \"Very well, then, I\u0027ll spray a little patch on your left forearm with an anesthetic. It will just feel like a cool wind. Nothing else. I\u0027ll then scrape a little skin from you just a tiny bit. There\u0027ll be no pain, no blood, no mark afterward. When I\u0027m done, I\u0027ll spray a little disinfectant on it. The whole thing will take just a few minutes. Does that sound all right to you?\" \\n\\n \"Sure,\" said Wanda, as she held out her arm. \\n\\n When it was over, Dr. Endelecki said, \"I\u0027ll put the scraping under the microscope, choose a decent cell, and put my computerized gene analyzer to work. It will mark off every last nucleotide, but there are billions of them. It will probably take the better part of a day. It\u0027s all automatic, of course, so I won\u0027t be sitting here watching it and there\u0027s no point in your doing so, either. \\n\\n \"Once the genome is prepared, it will take an even longer time to analyze it. If you want a complete job, it may take a couple of weeks. That is why it\u0027s so expensive a procedure. The work is hard and long. I\u0027ll call you in when I have it.\" She turned away, as if she had dismissed the family, and busied herself with the gleaming apparatus on the table in front of her. \\n\\n Seldon said, \"If you come across anything unusual, will you get in touch with me instantly? I mean, don\u0027t wait for a complete analysis if you find something in the first hour. Don\u0027t make me wait.\" \\n\\n \"The chances of finding anything in the first hour are very slim, but I promise you, Professor Seldon that I will be in touch with you at once if it seems necessary.\" \\n\\n Manella snatched Wanda\u0027s arm and led her off triumphantly. Raych followed, feet dragging. Seldon lingered and said, \"This is more important than you know, Dr. Endelecki.\" \\n\\n Dr. Endelecki nodded as she said, \"Whatever the reason, Professor, I\u0027ll do my best.\" \\n\\n Seldon left, his lips pressed tightly together. Why he had thought that somehow the genome would be worked out in five minutes and that a glance at it in another five minutes would give him an answer, he did not know. Now he would have to wait for weeks, without knowing what would be found. \\n\\n He ground his teeth. Would his newest brainchild, the Second Foundation, ever be established or was it an illusion that would remain always just out of reach? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46827.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
