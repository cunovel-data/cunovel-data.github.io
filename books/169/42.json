{"id":4862,"no":42,"title":"Chapter 21","content":"In two days Joranum had swept Trantor, partly by himself, mostly through his lieutenants. As Hari muttered to Dors, it was a campaign that had all the marks of military efficiency. \"He was born to be a war admiral in the old days,\" he said. \"He\u0027s wasted on politics.\" \n And Dors said, \"Wasted? At this rate, he\u0027s going to make himself First Minister in a week and, if he wishes, Emperor in two weeks. There are reports that some of the military garrisons are cheering him.\" \n Seldon shook his head. \"It will collapse, Dors.\" \n \"What? Joranum\u0027s party or the Empire?\" \n \"Joranum\u0027s party. The story of the robot has created an instant stir, especially with the effective use of that flier, but a little thought, a little coolness, and the public will see it for the ridiculous accusation it is.\" \n \"But, Hari,\" said Dors tightly, \"you needn\u0027t pretend with me. It is not a ridiculous story. How could Joranum possibly have found out that Demerzel is a robot?\" \n \"Oh, that.\u0027 Why, Raych told him so.\" \n \"Raych!\" \n \"That\u0027s right. He did his job perfectly and got back safely with the promise of being made Dahl\u0027s sector leader someday. Of course he was believed. I knew he would be.\" \n \"You mean you told Raych that Demerzel was a robot and had him pass on the news to Joranum?\" Dors looked utterly horrified. \n \"No, I couldn\u0027t do that. You know I couldn\u0027t tell Raych-or anyone-that Demerzel was a robot. I told Raych as firmly as I could that Demerzel was not a robot-and even that much was difficult. But I did ask him to tell Joranum that he was. He is under the firm impression that he lied to Joranum.\" \n \"But why, Hari? Why?\" \n \"It\u0027s not psychohistory, I\u0027ll tell you that. Don\u0027t you join the Emperor in thinking I\u0027m a magician. I just wanted Joranum to believe that Demerzel was a robot. He\u0027s a Mycogenian by birth, so he was filled from youth with his culture\u0027s tales of robots. Therefore, he was predisposed to believe and he was convinced that the public would believe with him.\" \n \"Well, won\u0027t they?\" \n \"Not really. After the initial shock is over, they will realize that it\u0027s madcap fiction-or they will think so. I\u0027ve persuaded Demerzel that he must give a talk on subetheric holovision to be broadcast to key portions of the Empire and to every sector on Trantor. He is to talk about everything but the robot issue. There are enough crises, we all know, to fill such a talk. People will listen and will hear nothing about robots. Then, at the end, he will be asked about the flier and he need not answer a word. He need only laugh.\" \n \"Laugh? I\u0027ve never known Demerzel to laugh. He almost never smiles.\" \n \"This time, Dors, he\u0027ll laugh. It is the one thing that no one ever visualizes a robot doing. You\u0027ve seen robots in holographic fantasies, haven\u0027t you? They\u0027re always pictured as literal-minded, unemotional, inhuman- That\u0027s what people are sure to expect. So Demerzel need merely laugh. And on top of that- Do you remember Sunmaster Fourteen, the religious leader of Mycogen?\" \n \"Of course I do. Literal-minded, unemotional, inhuman. He\u0027s never laughed, either.\" \n \"And he won\u0027t this time. I\u0027ve done a lot of work on this Joranum matter since I had that little set-to at the Field. I know Joranum\u0027s real name. I know where he was born, who his parents were, where he had his early training, and all of it, with documentary proof, has gone to Sunmaster Fourteen. I don\u0027t think Sunmaster likes Breakaways.\" \n \"But I thought you said you don\u0027t wish to spark off bigotry.\" \n \"I don\u0027t. If I had given the information to the holovision people, I would have, but I\u0027ve given it to Sunmaster, where, after all, it belongs.\" \n \"And he\u0027ll start off the bigotry.\" \n \"Of course he won\u0027t. No one on Trantor would pay any attention to Sunmaster-whatever he might say.\" \n \"Then what\u0027s the point?\" \n \"Well, that\u0027s what we\u0027ll see, Dors. I don\u0027t have a psychohistorical analysis of the situation. I don\u0027t even know if one is possible. I just hope that my judgment is right.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46623.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
