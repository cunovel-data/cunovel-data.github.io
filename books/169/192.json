Considering that we live under a dome, you would think we would have beautiful weather like this every evening.\" \n Wanda said indifferently, \"We would grow tired of it, Grandpa, if it were beautiful all the time. A little change from night to night is good for us.\" \n \"For you, because you\u0027re young, Wanda. You have many, many evenings ahead of you. I don\u0027t. I want more good ones.\" \n \"Now, Grandpa, you\u0027re not old. Your leg is doing well and your mind m as sharp as ever. I know. \" \n \"Sure. Go ahead. Make me feel better.\" He then said with an air of discomfort, \"I want to walk. I want to get out of this tiny apartment and take a walk to the Library and enjoy this beautiful evening.\" \n \"What do you want at the Library?\" \n \"At the moment, nothing. I want the walk. -But . \" \n \"Yes. But?\" \n \"I promised Raych I wouldn\u0027t go walking around Trantor without a bodyguard.\" \n \"Raych isn\u0027t here.\" \n \"I know,\" mumbled Seldon \"but a promise is a promise.\" \n \"He didn\u0027t say who the bodyguard should be, did he? Let\u0027s go for a walk and I\u0027ll be your bodyguard \" \n \"You?\" Seldon grinned. \n \"Yes, me. I hereby volunteer my services. Get yourself ready and we\u0027ll go for a walk.\" \n Seldon was amused. He had half a mind to go without his cane, since his leg was scarcely painful of late, but, on the other hand, he had a new cane, one in which the head had been filled with lead. It was both heavier and stronger than his old cane and, if he was going to have none other than Wanda as a bodyguard, he thought he had better bring his new cane. \n The walk was delightful and Seldon was terribly glad he had given in to the temptation-until they reached a certain spot. \n Seldon lifted his cane in a mixture of anger and resignation and said, \"Look at that!\" \n Wanda lifted her eyes. The dome was glowing, as it always did in the evening, in order to lend an air of first twilight. It grew darker as night went on, of course. \n What Seldon was pointing at, however, was a strip of darkness along the dome. A section of lights had gone out. \n Seldon said, \"When I first came to Trantor, anything like that was unthinkable. There were people tending the lights at all times. The city worked, but now it is falling apart in all these little ways and what bothers me most is that no one cares. Why aren\u0027t there petitions to the Imperial Palace? Why aren\u0027t there meetings of indignation? It is as though the people of Trantor expect the city to be falling apart and then they find themselves annoyed with me because I am pointing out that this is exactly what is happening.\" \n Wanda said softly, \"Grandpa, there are two men behind us.\" \n They had walked into the shadows beneath the broken dome lights and Seldon asked, \"Are they just walking?\" \n \"No.\" Wanda did not look at them. She did not have to. \"They\u0027re after you \" \n \"Can you stop them-push them?\" \n \"I\u0027m trying, but there are two and they are determined. It\u0027s-it\u0027s like pushing a wall.\" \n \"How far behind me are they?\" \n \"About three meters.\" \n \"Closing in?\" \n \"Yes, Grandpa.\" \n \"Tell me when they\u0027re a meter behind me.\" He slid his hand down his cane till he was holding the thin end, leaving the leaded head swinging free. \n \"Now, Grandpa!\" hissed Wanda. \n And Seldon turned, swinging his cane. It came down hard upon the shoulder of one of the men behind him, who went down with a scream, writhing on the pavement. \n Seldon said, \"Where\u0027s the other guy?\" \n \"He took off.\" \n Seldon looked down on the man on the ground and put his foot on his chest. He said, \"Go through his pockets, Wanda. Someone must have paid him and I\u0027d like to find his credit file-perhaps I can identify where they came from.\" He added thoughtfully, \"I meant to hit him on the head \" \n \"You\u0027d have killed him, Grandpa.\" \n Seldon nodded. \"It\u0027s what I wanted to do. Rather shameful. I\u0027m lucky I missed.\" \n A harsh voice said, \"What is all this?\" A figure in uniform came running up, perspiring. \"Give me that cane, you!\" \n \"Officer,\" said Seldon mildly. \n \"You can give me your story later. We\u0027ve got to call an ambulance for this poor man.\" \n \"Poor man, \" said Seldon angrily. \"He was going to assault me. I acted in self-defense.\" \n \"I saw it happen,\" said the security officer. \"This guy never laid a finger on you. You turned on him and struck him without provocation. That\u0027s not self-defense. That\u0027s assault and battery.\" \n \"Officer, I\u0027m telling you that-\" \n \"Don\u0027t tell me anything. You can tell it in court.\" \n Wanda said in a sweet small voice, \"Officer, if you will just listen to us-\" \n The officer said, \"You go along home, young lady.\" \n Wanda drew herself up. \"I most certainly won\u0027t, Officer. Where my grandfather goes, there go I.\" Her eyes flashed and the security officer muttered, \"Well, come along, then.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46920.html","bookId":169,"book":{"id":169,"title":"基地系列 Forward the Foundation 迈向基地","description":"简介： 《迈向基地》（Forward the Foundation），是美国科幻作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1993年的科幻小说短篇集，基地系列的第七部作品，归于基地前传，阿西莫夫继续以心理史学宗师兼基地之父哈里谢顿为主角的长篇小说。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/30/10-50-01-69-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM"}}
