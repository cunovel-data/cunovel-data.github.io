{"id":38323,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. IN A SIDE PATH","content":"“To sum up all, he has the worst fault-a husband can have, he\u0027s not my choice.” There is something doubtful in a love-making that is in more than two pairs of hands. This is a day of syndicates. The strength that lies in union is cultivated nowadays with much assiduity. But in matters of love the case is not yet altered, and never will be. It is a matter for two people to decide between themselves, and all interference is mistaken and deplorable. It is usually, one notices, those persons who are incapable of the feeling themselves who seek to interfere in the affairs of others. That one of the principals should seek aid in such interference proves without appeal that he does not know his business. Such aid as this Arthur Agar had sought. He had, as Dora suspected, written to his mother, with full particulars of the conversation beneath the Hurlingham trees. He had laid before her many arguments, which, by reason of their effeminacy, appealed to her illogical mind, proving that Dora could not do better than marry him. The arrangement, he argued, was satisfactory from whatever point of view it might be taken; and, finally, he begged his mother to try and succeed where he had failed. He did not propose that Mrs. Agar should appeal to Dora; not because such a course was repellent, but merely because he knew a better. He suggested that Mrs. Agar should sound Mr. Glynde upon the matter. This suggestion was in itself a stroke of diplomacy. The astute have no doubt found out by this time that the Reverend Thomas Glynde loved money; and a man who loves money has not the makings of a good father within him, whatever else he may have. Whether Arthur was aware of this it would be hard to say. Whether he had the penetration to know that, in the nature of things, Mr. Glynde would urge Dora to marry Arthur Agar and Stagholme, without due regard to her own feelings in the matter, is a question upon which no man can give a reliable opinion. Certain it is that such a course was precisely what the Reverend Thomas had marked out for himself. He had an exaggerated respect for money and position—a title was a thing to be revered. Clergymen, like artists, are dependent on patronage, and must swallow their pride. It is therefore, perhaps, only natural that Mr. Glynde should be quite prepared to make some sacrifice of feeling or sentiment (especially the feeling and sentiment of another) in order to secure a position. Arthur Agar simply followed the spirit of the age. He could not succeed alone, and therefore he proceeded to form a syndicate to compel Dora to love him, or in the meantime to marry him. “Of course,” said Sister Cecilia to Mrs. Agar, when the matter was first under discussion, “she would soon learn to care for him. Women always do.” Which shows how much Sister Cecilia knew about it. “And besides, I believe she cares for him already,” added Mrs. Agar, who never did things by halves. Sister Cecilia dropped her head on one side and looked convinced—to order. “Of course,” pursued Mrs. Agar vaguely, “I am very fond of Dora; no one could be more so. But I must confess that I do not always understand her.” Even to Sister Cecilia it would not do to confess that she was afraid of her. The interview was easily brought about. Mrs. Agar wrote a note to the Rector and asked him to luncheon. The Rector, who had not had many legal affairs to settle during his uneventful life, was always pleased to be consulted upon a subject of which he knew absolutely nothing. Besides, they gave one a good luncheon at Stagholme in those days. “I have had a letter from dear Arthur,” said Mrs. Agar, at a moment which she deemed propitious, namely, after a third glass of the Stagholme brown sherry. “Ah! I hope he is well. The boy is not strong.” “Yes, he is quite well, thank you. But of course he has had a great shock, and one cannot expect him to get over it all at once.” The Rector did not hold much by sentiment, so he contented himself with a grave sip of sherry. “And now I am afraid there is fresh trouble,” added Mrs. Agar. “Been running into debt?” suggested Mr. Glynde. “No, it is not that. No, it is Dora.” “Dora! What has Dora been doing?” Mrs. Agar was polishing the rim of a silver salt-cellar with her forefinger. “Of course,” she said, “I have seen it going on for a long time. My poor boy has always—well, he has always admired Dora.”\u0027 “Oh!” “Yes, and of course I should like nothing better. I am sure they would be most happy.” The Rector looked doubtful. “We must not forget,” he said, “that Arthur is constitutionally delicate. That extreme repugnance to active exercise, the love of ease and—er—indoor pursuits, show a tendency to enfeeble the organisation which might—I don\u0027t say it will, but it might—turn to decline.” “But the doctors say that he is quite strong. Everybody cannot be robust and—and massive.” She was thinking of Jem, against whom she had always borne a grudge, because his inoffensive presence alone had the power of making Arthur look puny. “No; and of course with care one may hope that Arthur will live to a ripe old age,” said the Rector, who was only coquetting with the question. Mrs. Agar played with a biscuit. She had a rooted aversion to the query direct. “I should have thought,” she said, “that you or her mother would have seen that such an attachment was likely to form itself.” The truth was that the Reverend Thomas did not devote very much thought to any subject which did not directly influence his own well-being. He had at one time thought that an attachment between Jem and Dora might conveniently result from a childhood\u0027s friendship, but Arthur had not entered into his prognostications at all. He rather despised the youth, as much on his own account as that he was Anna Agar\u0027s son. “Can\u0027t say,” he replied, “that the thing ever entered my head. Of course, if the young people have settled it all between themselves, I suppose we must give them our blessing, and be thankful that we have been saved further trouble.” He thought it rather strange that Dora should have fixed her affections on such an unlikely object as Arthur Agar; but it was part of his earthly creed that the feelings of women are as incomprehensible as they are unimportant. Which, by the way, serves to show how very little the Rector of Stagholme knew of the world. “But,” protested Mrs. Agar, “they have not settled it between themselves. That is just it.” “Just what?” “Just the difficulty.” Immediately Mr. Glynde\u0027s face fell to its usual degree of set depression. “What do they want me to do?” he inquired, with that air of resignation which is in reality no resignation at all. “Well,” said Mrs. Agar volubly, “it appears that Arthur spoke to Dora at Hurlingham, and for some reason she said No. I can\u0027t understand it at all. I am sure she has always appeared to like him very much. It may have been some passing fancy or something, you know. When she is told that it would please us all, perhaps she will change her mind. Poor Arthur is terribly cut up about it. Of course a man in his position does not quite expect to be treated cavalierly like that.” Mr. Glynde smiled. Behind the parson there was somewhat even better; there was a just and honest English gentleman, which, in the way of human species, is very hard to beat. “I am afraid Arthur will have to manage such affairs for himself. When a girl is settling a question involving her whole life she does not usually pause to consider the position of the man who asks her to be his wife. He would have no business to ask her had he no position, and the rest is merely a matter of degrees.” “Then you don\u0027t care about the match?” said Mrs. Agar, to whose mind the earliest rudiments of logic were incomprehensible. “I do not say that,” replied the Rector, with the patience of a man who has had dealings with women all his life; “but I should like it to be understood that Dora is quite free to choose for herself. I am willing to tell her that the match would be satisfactory to me. Arthur is a gentleman, which is saying a good deal in these days. He is affectionate, and, so far as I know, a dutiful son. I have little doubt he would make a good husband.” Mrs. Agar wiped away an obvious tear, which ran off Mr. Glynde\u0027s mental epidermis like water off the back of the proverbial fowl. This also he had learnt in the course of his dealings with the world. “He has been a good son to me,” sniffed the fond and foolish mother. Neither of these persons was capable of understanding that “goodness” is not all we want in husband or wife. These good husbands—heaven help their wives!—break as many hearts as those who are labelled by the world with the black ticket. “Then I may tell Arthur that you will help him?” said Mrs. Agar, with a sudden access of practical energy. “You may tell him that he has my good wishes, and that I will point out to Dora the advantages of—acceding to his desire. There are, of course, advantages on both sides, we know that.” As usual, Mrs. Agar overdid things. The airiness of her indifference might have deceived a child of eight, provided that its intellect was not de première force. “Ye-es,” she murmured, “I suppose Dora would bring her little—eh—subscription towards the household expenses. Sister Cecilia gave me to understand that there was a little something coming to her under her mother\u0027s marriage settlement.” Mrs. Agar was not clever enough to see that she had made a mistake. The mention of Sister Cecilia\u0027s name acted on the Rector like a mental douche. He was just beginning to give way to expansiveness—probably under the suave influence of the brown sherry—and the name of Sister Cecilia pulled him together with a jerk. The jerk extended to his features; but Mrs. Agar was one of those cunning women whom no man need fear. She was so cunning that she deceived herself into seeing that which she wished to see, and nothing else. “All that,” said the Rector gravely, “can be discussed when Arthur has persuaded Dora to say Yes.” He was in the position of an unfortunate person who, having come into controversy with the police, is warned that every word he says may be used in evidence against him. He had been reminded that every detail of the present conversation would be repeated to Sister Cecilia, with embellishments or subtractions as might please the narrator\u0027s fancy or suit her purpose. “A dangerous woman” he called Sister Cecilia in his most gloomy voice, and a parson must perforce fear dangerous women. That is one of the trials of the ministry. Mrs. Agar laughed in a forced manner. “Of course,” she said—she had a habit of beginning her remarks with these two words—“of course, we need not think of such questions yet. I am sure all I want is the happiness of the dear children.” “Umph!” ejaculated Mr. Glynde, who was not always a model of politeness. “That, I am sure,” continued Mrs. Agar, with a dabbing pocket-handkerchief, “is the dearest wish of us all.” “When does the boy come home?” inquired the Rector. “Oh, in a week. I am so longing for him to come. He has to go to town to get some clothes, which will delay his return by one night.” “Is he doing any good this term?” Mrs. Agar looked slightly hurt. “Well, he always works very hard, I am only afraid that he should overdo it. You know, I suppose, that he did not get through his examination this term. Of course it is no good my saying anything, but I am quite convinced that they are not dealing fairly by him. I have seen some of those examination papers, and some of the questions are simply spiteful. They do it on purpose, I know. And Sister Cecilia tells me that that does happen sometimes. For some reason or other—because they have been snubbed, or something like that—the masters, the examiners, or whatever they are called, make a dead set at some men, and simply keep them back. They don\u0027t give them the marks that they ought to have. Why should Arthur always fail? Of course the thing is unfair.” This theory was not quite new to the Rector. He had given up arguing about it, and usually took refuge in flight. He did so on this occasion. But as he walked home across the park, smoking a cigarette, he reflected that to the owner of Stagholme such a small matter as a college career was, after all, of no importance. These broad acres, the stately forests, the grand old house, raised Arthur Agar above such considerations, indeed above most considerations. And Mr. Glynde made up his mind to put it very strongly to Dora.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2871/79439.html","bookId":1177,"book":{"id":1177,"title":"From One Generation to Another","description":"简介： Il faut se garder des premiers mouvements, parce qu\u0027ils sont presque toujours honntes.Dearest Anna,I see from the newspaper before me of March 13, that I am reported dead.
