{"id":41317,"no":342,"title":"Epilogue 1 Chapter 10","content":"NATASHA was married in the early spring of 1813, and by 1820 she had three daughters and a son. The latter had been eagerly desired, and she was now nursing him herself. She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was hard to recognise in the robust-looking young mother the slim, mobile Natasha of old days. Her features had become more defined, and wore an expression of calm softness and serenity. Her face had no longer that ever-glowing fire of eagerness that had once constituted her chief charm. Now, often her face and body were all that was to be seen, and the soul was not visible at all. All there was to be seen in her was a vigorous, handsome, and fruitful mother. Only on rare occasions now the old fire glowed in her again. That happened only when, as now, her husband returned after absence, when a sick child recovered, or when she spoke to Countess Marya of Prince Andrey (to her husband she never spoke of Prince Andrey, fancying he might be jealous of her love for him), or on the rare occasions when something happened to attract her to her singing, which she had entirely laid aside since her marriage. And at those rare moments, when the old fire glowed again, she was more attractive, with her handsome, fully-developed figure, than she had ever been in the past.\\n\\n Since her marriage Natasha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in Petersburg, on their estate near Moscow, and at her mother\u0027s; that is to say, at Nikolay\u0027s. The young Countess Bezuhov was little seen in society, and those who had seen her there were not greatly pleased with her. She was neither charming nor amiable. It was not that Natasha was fond of solitude (she could not have said whether she liked it or not; she rather supposed indeed that she did not); but as she was bearing and nursing children, and taking interest in every minute of her husband\u0027s life, she could not meet all these demands on her except by renouncing society. Every one who had known Natasha before her marriage marvelled at the change that had taken place in her, as though it were something extraordinary. Only the old countess, with her mother\u0027s insight, had seen that what was at the root of all Natasha\u0027s wild outbursts of feeling was simply the need of children and a husband of her own, as she often used to declare, more in earnest than in joke, at Otradnoe. The mother was surprised at the wonder of people who did not understand Natasha, and repeated that she had always known that she would make an exemplary wife and mother.\\n\\n “Only she does carry her devotion to her husband and children to an extreme,” the countess would say; “so much so, that it\u0027s positively foolish.”\\n\\n Natasha did not follow the golden rule preached by so many prudent persons, especially by the French, that recommends that a girl on marrying should not neglect herself, should not give up her accomplishments, should think even more of her appearance than when a young girl, and should try to fascinate her husband as she had fascinated him before he was her husband. Natasha, on the contrary, had at once abandoned all her accomplishments, of which the greatest was her singing. She gave that up just because it was such a great attraction. Natasha troubled herself little about manners or delicacy of speech; nor did she think of showing herself to her husband in the most becoming attitudes and costumes, nor strive to avoid worrying him by being over-exacting. She acted in direct contravention of all those rules. She felt that the arts of attraction that instinct had taught her to use before would now have seemed only ludicrous to her husband, to whom she had from the first moment given herself up entirely, that is with her whole soul, not keeping a single corner of it hidden from him. She felt that the tie that bound her to her husband did not rest on those romantic feelings which had attracted him to her, but rested on something else undefined, but as strong as the tie that bound her soul to her body.\\n\\n To curl her hair, put on a crinoline, and sing songs to attract her husband would have seemed to her as strange as to deck herself up so as to please herself. To adorn herself to please others might perhaps have been agreeable to her—she did not know—but she had absolutely no time for it. The chief reason why she could not attend to her singing, nor to her dress, nor to the careful choice of her words was that she simply had no time to think of those things.\\n\\n It is well known that man has the faculty of entire absorption in one subject, however trivial that subject may appear to be. And it is well known that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to indefinite proportions if concentrated attention be devoted to it.\\n\\n The subject in which Natasha was completely absorbed was her family, that is, her husband, whom she kept such a hold on so that he should belong entirely to her, to his home and her children, whom she had to carry, to bear, to nurse and to bring up.\\n\\n And the more she put, not her mind only, but her whole soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the more that subject seemed to enlarge under her eyes, and the feebler and the more inadequate her own powers seemed for coping with it, so that she concentrated them all on that one subject, and still had not time to do all that seemed to her necessary.\\n\\n There were in those days, just as now, arguments and discussions on the rights of women, on the relations of husband and wife, and on freedom and rights in marriage, though they were not then, as now, called questions. But these questions had no interest for Natasha, in fact she had absolutely no comprehension of them.\\n\\n Those questions, then as now, existed only for those persons who see in marriage only the satisfaction the married receive from one another, that is, only the first beginnings of marriage and not all its significance, which lies in the family.\\n\\n Such discussions and the questions of to-day, like the question how to get the utmost possible gratification out of one\u0027s dinner, then, as now, did not exist for persons for whom the object of dinner is nourishment, and the object of wedlock is the family.\\n\\n If the end of dinner is the nourishment of the body, the man who eats two dinners obtains possibly a greater amount of pleasure, but he does not attain the object of it, since two dinners cannot be digested by the stomach.\\n\\n If the end of marriage is the family, the person who prefers to have several wives and several husbands may possibly derive a great deal of satisfaction therefrom, but will not in any case have a family. If the end of dinner is nourishment and the end of marriage is the family, the whole question is only solved by not eating more than the stomach can digest and not having more husbands or wives than as many as are needed for the family, that is, one wife and one husband. Natasha needed a husband. A husband was given her; and her husband gave her a family. And she saw no need of another better husband, and indeed, as all her spiritual energies were devoted to serving that husband and his children, she could not picture, and found no interest in trying to picture, what would have happened had things been different.\\n\\n Natasha did not care for society in general, but she greatly prized the society of her kinsfolk—of Countess Marya, her brother, her mother, and Sonya. She cared for the society of those persons to whom she could rush in from the nursery in a dressing-gown with her hair down; to whom she could, with a joyful face, show a baby\u0027s napkin stained yellow instead of green, and to receive their comforting assurances that that proved that baby was now really better.\\n\\n Natasha neglected herself to such a degree that her dresses, her untidy hair, her inappropriately blurted-out words, and her jealousy— she was jealous of Sonya, of the governess, of every woman, pretty and ugly—were a continual subject of jests among her friends. The general opinion was that Pierre was tied to his wife\u0027s apron strings, and it really was so. From the earliest days of their marriage Natasha had made plain her claims. Pierre had been greatly surprised at his wife\u0027s view—to him a completely novel idea—that every minute of his life belonged to her and their home. He was surprised at his wife\u0027s demands, but he was flattered by them, and he acquiesced in them.\\n\\n Pierre was so far under petticoat government that he did not dare to be attentive, or even to speak with a smile, to any other woman; did not dare go to dine at the club, without good reason, simply for entertainment; did not dare spent money on idle whims, and did not dare to be away from home for any long time together, except on business, in which his wife included his scientific pursuits. Though she understood nothing of the latter, she attached great consequence to them. To make up for all this Pierre had complete power in his own house to dispose of the whole household, as well as of himself, as he chose. In their own home Natasha made herself a slave to her husband; and the whole household had to go on tiptoe if the master were busy reading or writing in his study. Pierre had only to show the slightest preference, for what he desired to be at once carried out. He had but to express a wish and Natasha jumped up at once and ran for what he wanted.\\n\\n The whole household was ruled by the supposed directions of the master, that is, by the wishes of Pierre, which Natasha tried to guess. Their manner of life and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, Natasha\u0027s pursuits, and the bringing up of the children—all followed, not only Pierre\u0027s expressed wishes, but even the deductions Natasha strove to draw from the ideas he explained in conversation with her. And she guessed very correctly what was the essential point of Pierre\u0027s wishes, and having once guessed it she was steadfast in adhering to it: even when Pierre himself would have veered round she opposed him with his own weapons.\\n\\n In the troubled days that Pierre could never forget, after the birth of their first child, they had tried three wet nurses, one after another, for the delicate baby, and Natasha had fallen ill with anxiety. At the time Pierre had explained to her Rousseau\u0027s views on the unnaturalness and harmfulness of a child being suckled by any woman but its own mother and told her he fully agreed with those views. When the next baby was born, in spite of the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband himself, who had looked on it as something unheard of, and injurious, she insisted on having her own way, and from that day had nursed all her children herself. It happened very often in moments of irritability that the husband and wife quarrelled; but long after their dispute Pierre had, to his own delight and surprise, found in his wife\u0027s actions, as well as words, that very idea of his with which she had quarrelled. And he not only found his own idea, but found it purified of all that was superfluous, and had been evoked by the heat of argument in his own expression of the idea.\\n\\n After seven years of married life, Pierre had a firm and joyful consciousness that he was not a bad fellow, and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in his wife. In himself he felt all the good and bad mingled together, and obscuring one another. But in his wife he saw reflected only what was really good; everything not quite good was left out. And this result was not reached by the way of logical thought, but by way of a mysterious, direct reflection of himself.\\n\\n 娜塔莎婚后同丈夫一起在莫斯科、彼得堡、在莫斯科郊外的村庄和她自己的娘家，也就是尼古拉家里住过。年轻的别祖霍夫伯爵夫人很少在交际场中露面，见到她的人对她也没有好感。她既不可亲，也不可爱。并不是娜塔莎喜欢孤独（她自己也不知道是不是喜欢孤独，她觉得是不喜欢）。她是因为接二连三地怀孕，生育，喂奶，时刻参与丈夫的生活，只得谢绝社交活动。凡是在娜塔莎婚前就认识她的人看到她这种变化，无不像看到一件新奇事那样感到吃惊。只有老伯爵夫人凭着母性的本能懂得，娜塔莎的热情都出于她需要家庭，需要丈夫。她本人在奥特拉德诺耶曾经一本正经地而并非开玩笑地说过这样的话，老伯爵夫人，作为母亲，看到人家不了解娜塔莎，大惊小怪，也感到惊奇，她总是说娜塔莎是个贤妻良母。\\n\\n “她把全部的爱都用到丈夫和孩子们身上，”伯爵夫人说，“爱到极点，简直有点傻了。”\\n\\n 聪明人，特别是法国人，都一直在宣扬：一个姑娘在出嫁后不应当就不修边幅，疏于打扮，埋没自己的才华与丰采，而应该更加注意自己的仪表，使丈夫像婚前一样还对自己倾心。但娜塔莎却没有遵守这条金科玉律。她却恰恰相反，她一出嫁就抛开了原先姑娘时所有的迷人之处，尤其是她最迷人的歌唱。她不再唱歌，就因为唱歌最能使人入迷。她变得满不在乎，既不注意自己的言谈举止，也不向丈夫献媚，更不讲究梳妆打扮，不向丈夫提出种种要求，以免他受拘束，她于是一反常规。她认为以前向丈夫施展魅力是出于本能，目前在丈夫眼里再这样做就会显得可笑，要知道她一开始就将自己整个身心毫无保留地奉献给他。她觉得维系他们夫妻关系的已不是过去那种富于诗意的感情，而是另一种难以说明的、牢固的东西，就像自己的心灵同肉体的结合体。\\n\\n 她认为，梳上蓬松的卷发，穿上时髦的连衣裙，唱着抒情的歌曲，以此来取得丈夫的欢心，就像自得其乐地把自己梳妆打扮一番一样可笑。现在，为讨人喜欢而梳妆打扮，也许会给她带来乐趣，但她实在没有工夫。平时她不唱歌，不注意梳妆打扮，说话时不斟酌词句，主要是因为她根本没有时间去那么做。\\n\\n 当然，人能把全部精力贯注于一件事，不管这件事是多么微不足道。而一旦全神贯注，不论什么微不足道的事就会变成极其重要的大事情了。\\n\\n 娜塔莎全神贯注的就是家庭，也就是她的丈夫和孩子们。她要使丈夫完全属于她，属于这个家。另外，她还要生育、抚养和教育孩子们。\\n\\n 她投身于她所从事的活动，不仅用全部智慧而且用了她整个心灵，她陷得越深，那件事就显得愈大，她就更感到势单力薄，难以胜任，因此，即使她全力以赴，还是来不及做完她应该做的事。\\n\\n 有关妇女权利、夫妻关系、夫妻的自由和权利的议论，当时也已存在。不过，没有像现在一样看成那么重大的问题。不过，娜塔莎对这些问题不仅不感兴趣，而且一点也不能理解。\\n\\n 这些问题在当时也同现在一样，只对那些把夫妇关系纯粹看成某种满足的人才存在。他们只看到婚姻的开端，而没有看到家庭的全部含义。\\n\\n 这些议论和现在存在的一些问题就像从吃饭中获得最大满足一样，但对那些认为吃饭的目的是取得营养，结婚的目的是建立家庭的人来说，当初和现在一样，这种问题是不存在的。\\n\\n 如果吃饭的目的在于使身体得到营养，那么两顿饭一起吃的人也许会感到很大的满足，然而不能达到吃饭的目的，因为胃容纳不了两顿饭的饭量。\\n\\n 如果婚姻的目的是建立家庭，那么希望娶许多妻子或嫁许多丈夫的人也许能获得许多满足，但决不能建立家庭。\\n\\n 如果吃饭的目的在于得到营养，结婚的目的在于建立家庭，那么要达到目的，吃饭就不能超过胃的容量，一个家庭里的夫妻也不能超过需要，就是说只能是一夫一妻。娜塔莎需要一个丈夫，她有了一个丈夫，丈夫给了她一个家庭。另外再找一个更好的丈夫，她不仅认为没有必要，而且由于她全心全意为丈夫和家庭操劳，她不能想象另一种情况，对此也毫无兴趣。\\n\\n 一般说来，娜塔莎不喜欢交际，但她很重视亲戚的来往，珍惜同玛丽亚伯爵夫人、哥哥、母亲和索尼娅的来往。她会穿着睡袍、披头散发、喜形于色地从育儿室大步跑出来，把不再沾着绿色屎斑，而是沾着黄色屎斑的尿布给他们看，听他们安慰地说孩子身体好多了。\\n\\n 娜塔莎不修边幅，她的衣着、她的发型、她那不合时宜的谈吐、她的嫉妒心（她嫉妒索尼娅、嫉妒家庭女教师，嫉妒每一个女人，不论她美或丑）都成了她周围人们的笑柄。大家都认为皮埃尔对他老婆的管教服服贴贴，事实上也是如此。娜塔莎婚后一开始就提出了她的要求。她认为他丈夫的每一分钟都应该属于她和家庭。娜塔莎的这一崭新观点使皮埃尔大吃一惊。皮埃尔对妻子的要求虽然感到不胜惊讶，但也十分得意，完全照她的话去做。\\n\\n 皮埃尔对妻子言听计从，这表现在他不仅不敢向别的女人献殷勤，而且不敢露出笑容同别的女人谈话，不敢去俱乐部吃饭作为消遣，不敢随便花钱，不敢长期出门，除非去办正经事。妻子把皮埃尔的学术活动算作正经事，尽管她对此一窍不通，都很重视。作为交换条件，皮埃尔在家里有权处理自己的事，也可以按照自己的意思安排全家的事。娜塔莎在家里甘当丈夫的奴隶。皮埃尔工作时，也就是当他在书斋里读书写作时，全家人都踮着脚尖走路。只要皮埃尔表示喜欢什么，他的愿望总能得到满足。只要他一提出什么新的要求，娜塔莎立即全力以赴，加以实现。\\n\\n 全家都遵照实际上并不存在的皮埃尔的吩咐，也就是按照娜塔莎竭力猜测的丈夫的愿望行事。全家的生活方式、居住地点、社交活动、娜塔莎的工作、孩子的教育，无不遵照皮埃尔的心意，而且娜塔莎还竭力从皮埃尔的言谈中揣测他的意思。她总是能相当准确地揣摩皮埃尔的真实意图，一旦猜透，她就坚决去办。如果皮埃尔违背自己的意愿，娜塔莎就以他原来的想法反驳他，同他作斗争。\\n\\n 有一个时期，他们生活非常困难，皮埃尔永远不会忘记。当时，娜塔莎生下第一个瘦弱的孩子后，不得不先后换了三个奶妈。娜塔莎都急出病来了。有一天，皮埃尔把他信奉的卢梭思想讲给她听，说请奶妈喂奶违反自然规律，而且对母子都有害。于是娜塔莎在生第二个孩子后不顾母亲、医生和丈夫的反对，违反当时的风俗习惯（这在当时闻所未闻，而且认为有害），坚持自己喂奶，而且从此所有的孩子都由她亲自喂奶。\\n\\n 常常有这样的事：两口子在气头上争吵起来，但在争吵过一段时间后，皮埃尔常常又惊又喜地发现，不仅是妻子的言论，而且是她的行动中都反映出他原来的想法，而这种想法是她原来反对的。在她所讲的话里，皮埃尔不仅发现自己原来的想法，而且发现，她已避而不提他在争吵中说过的偏激话。\\n\\n 过了七年夫妻生活后，皮埃尔高兴地深信自己不是一个坏人，他之所以有这种想法，是因为他从妻子身上看到了自己。他觉得自己内心有善有恶，两者互相遮掩。但在妻子身上只反映出他身上真正善的一面，而那些不完善的东西都被扬弃了。这种情况不是通过逻辑思维，而是通过某种神秘的渠道直接反映出来的。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3640.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
