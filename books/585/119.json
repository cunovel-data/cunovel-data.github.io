{"id":41094,"no":119,"title":"Book 6 Chapter 17","content":"AFTER PRINCE ANDREY, Boris came up to ask Natasha to dance, and he was followed by the dancing adjutant who had opened the ball, and many other young men. Natasha, flushed and happy, passed on her superfluous partners to Sonya, and never ceased dancing all the evening, She noticed nothing and saw nothing of what was absorbing every one else at that ball. She did not notice that the Tsar talked a long time with the French ambassador, that his manner was particularly gracious to a certain lady, that Prince So-and-So and Mr. So-and-So had said and done this and that, that Ellen\u0027s success had been brilliant, and that So-and-So had paid her marked attention. She did not even see the Tsar, and was only aware that he was gone from noticing that the ball became livelier after his departure. In one of the most enjoyable cotillions before supper, Prince Andrey danced again with Natasha. He reminded her of how he had first seen her in the avenue at Otradnoe, and how she could not sleep on that moonlight night, and told her how he had unwittingly listened to her. Natasha blushed at these recollections, and tried as it were to excuse herself, as though there were something to be ashamed of in the emotion to which Prince Andrey had unwittingly played the eavesdropper. Like all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrey liked meeting anything not of the conventional society stamp. And such was Natasha with her wonder, her delight, her shyness, and even her mistakes in talking French. His manner was particularly tender and circumspect as he talked to her. Sitting beside her, and talking of the simplest and most trifling subjects, Prince Andrey admired the radiant brilliance of her eyes and her smile, that had no concern with what was said but was due simply to her own happiness. When Natasha was chosen again, and she got up with a smile and was dancing, Prince Andrey particularly admired her shy grace. In the middle of the cotillion, Natasha went back to her place, breathless at the end of a figure. Another partner again chose her. She was tired and panting, and evidently she thought for an instant of refusing, but immediately she put her hand on her partner\u0027s shoulder and was off again gaily, smiling to Prince Andrey. “I should have been glad to rest and sit by you. I\u0027m tired; but you see how they keep asking me, and I\u0027m glad of it, and I\u0027m happy, and I love every one, and you and I understand all about it,” and more, much more was said in that smile. When her partner left her side, Natasha flew across the room to choose two ladies for the figure. “If she goes first to her cousin and then to another lady, she will be my wife,” Prince Andrey—greatly to his own surprise—caught himself saying mentally, as he watched her. She did go first to her cousin. “What nonsense does sometimes come into one\u0027s mind!” thought Prince Andrey, “but one thing\u0027s certain, that girl is so charming, so original, that she won\u0027t be dancing here a month before she will be married.… She\u0027s a rare thing here,” he thought, as Natasha settled herself beside him, sticking in the rose that was falling out of her bodice. At the end of the cotillion, the old count in his blue frock coat went up to the young people who had been dancing. He invited Prince Andrey to come and see them, and asked his daughter whether she were enjoying herself. Natasha did not at once answer, she only smiled a smile that said reproachfully: “How can you ask such a question?” “Enjoying myself as I never have before in my life!” she said, and Prince Andrey noticed how her thin arms were swiftly raised as though to embrace her father, and dropped again at once. Natasha was happy as she had never been in her life. She was at that highest pitch of happiness, when one becomes completely good and kind, and disbelieves in the very possibility of evil, unhappiness, and sorrow. At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position his wife took in the highest court circle. He was sullen and absent-minded. There was a broad furrow right across his forehead, as he stood in a window, staring over his spectacles and seeing no one. Natasha passed close by him on her way in to supper. Pierre\u0027s gloomy, unhappy face struck her. She stopped, facing him. She longed to come to his aid, to bestow on him some of her own overflowing happiness. “How delightful it is,” she said; “isn\u0027t it?” Pierre smiled an absent-minded smile, obviously not grasping what was said to him. “Yes, I\u0027m very glad,” he said. “How can people be discontented at anything!” thought Natasha. “Especially any one as nice as Bezuhov.” In Natasha\u0027s eyes all the people at the ball were particularly kind, sweet, good people, loving one another; none were capable of wronging one another, and so all must be happy. 安德烈公爵像所有在上流社会成长的人那样，喜欢在上流社会中碰见那种未被打上上流社会共同烙印的东西。娜塔莎也是如此：她流露着惊奇、欣喜和畏葸的神情，说法国话时甚至有许多错误。他很温和地、小心谨慎地对待她并且怀着同样的态度同她谈话。安德烈公爵坐在她身旁，和她谈论到最平凡的、最琐细的事情，他正在欣赏她那眼睛和笑容所焕发的欣悦的光辉，她不是由于他说的话而是由于内心的幸福而流露微笑。当人家挑选娜塔莎，她面带微笑站起来，在大厅中跳舞的时候，安德烈公爵特别欣赏她那羞怯而优雅的姿态。当科季里昂舞跳到半中间的时候，娜塔莎耍完了花样，还在困难地喘气，就向自己的坐位前面走去。新舞伴又邀请她。她疲倦了，喘不过气来，看样子，她想拒绝，但是又马上快活地把手搭在舞伴的肩上，并且面向安德烈公爵微微一笑。 “我很想休息一下，和您坐在一块儿，我疲倦了，可是您知道，他们都在选我作舞伴，我感到高兴，我感到幸运，我喜爱所有的人，我和您都懂得这一切。”这种微笑仿佛说出了许多许多的话。当舞伴把她放开以后，娜塔莎跑着穿过大厅，拖到了两个女伴，一同耍花样。 “如果她首先走到她表姐面前，然后就走到另一个女伴面前，那末她将是我的妻子了。”安德烈公爵望着她，完全出乎意料地对自己说。她首先走到她表姐面前。 “有时候脑子里竟会想到多么荒诞无稽的话啊！”安德烈公爵想了想，“不过有一点倒是千真万确的：这个女郎多么可爱，多么特殊，她在这儿还不消跳满一个月，就会嫁人的……在此地她是稀有的珍宝。”当娜塔莎弄平硬腰带侧边的那朵玫瑰花、在他身旁坐下的时候，他想道。 科季里昂舞跳完之后，老伯爵穿着蓝色燕尾服走到跳舞的人跟前。他邀请安德烈公爵到他家里去做客，又问问女儿，她是否觉得快活？娜塔莎没有回答，只是微微一笑，这样的微笑带有责备的意味，仿佛在说：“这一点怎么可以问呢？” “这一生从来没有这样快活啊！”她说道，安德烈公爵发现，她那双干瘦的手飞快地举起来抱住父亲，旋即低垂下来，娜塔莎在这一生中从来都没有这样幸福。她正处于极度的幸福之中，此时一个人会变得十分仁慈和优秀，他不相信在尘世之中会有恶事、不幸和悲痛。 皮埃尔在这个舞会上头一次感觉到，他的老婆在上层社会所占的地位使他自己蒙受屈辱。他神色郁闷，漫不经心。他的额角上横着一条深深的皱纹，他站在窗口，透过眼镜向前望去，没有望见任何人。 娜塔莎去用晚餐时，经过他身旁。 皮埃尔那副阴沉的忧愁的面孔使她大吃一惊。她在他对面停步了。她很想助他一臂之力，赐予他以剩馀的幸福。 “伯爵，多么快活，”她说，“是吗？” “对，我很高兴。”他说。 “他们怎么会对什么事情表示不满呢？”娜塔莎想道，“尤其是像别祖霍夫这样的好人？”在娜塔莎看来，凡是出席舞会的人都同样是仁慈的、可爱的、优秀的，他们互相爱护，谁也不会使谁难受，因此人人应该是幸运的。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3417.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
