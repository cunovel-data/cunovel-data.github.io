{"id":41016,"no":41,"title":"Book 2 Chapter 16","content":"AFTER MAKING A CIRCUIT round the whole line of the army, from the right flank to the left, Prince Andrey rode up to that battery from which the staff-officer told him that the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted and stood by the end of one of the four cannons, which had been taken off their platforms. An artilleryman on sentinel duty in front of the cannons was just confronting the officer, but at a sign being made to him, he renewed his regular, monotonous pacing. Behind the cannons stood their platforms, and still further behind, the picket-ropes and camp-fires of the artillerymen. To the left, not far from the end cannon, was a little newly rigged-up shanty, from which came the sounds of offices\u0027 voices in eager conversation. From the battery there was in fact a view of almost the whole disposition of the Russian forces, and the greater part of the enemy\u0027s. Directly facing the battery on the skyline of the opposite hill could be seen the village of Sch?ngraben; to the left and to the right could be discerned in three places through the smoke of the camp-fires masses of the French troops, of which the greater number were undoubtedly in the village itself and behind the hill. To the left of the village there was something in the smoke that looked like a battery, but it could not be made out clearly by the naked eye. Our right flank was stationed on a rather steep eminence, which dominated the French position. About it were disposed our infantry regiments, and on the very ridge could be seen dragoons. In the centre, where was placed Tushin\u0027s battery, from which Prince Andrey was surveying the position, there was the most sloping and direct descent to the stream that separated us from Sch?ngraben. On the left our troops were close to a copse, where there was the smoke of the camp-fires of our infantry, chopping wood in it. The French line was wider than ours, and it was obviously easy for the French to outflank us on both sides. Behind our position was a precipitous and deep ravine, down which it would be difficult to retreat with artillery and cavalry. Prince Andrey leaned his elbow on the cannon, and taking out a note-book, sketched for himself a plan of the disposition of the troops. In two places he made notes with a pencil, intending to speak on the points to Bagration. He meant to suggest first concentrating all the artillery in the centre, and secondly drawing the cavalry back to the further side of the ravine. Prince Andrey, who was constantly in attendance on the commander-in-chief, watching the movements of masses of men and man?uvring of troops, and also continually studying the historical accounts of battles, could not help viewing the course of the military operations that were to come only in their general features. His imagination dwelt on the broad possibilities, such as the following: “If the enemy makes the right flank the point of attack,” he said to himself, “the Kiev grenadiers and Podolosky Chasseurs will have to defend their position, till the reserves from the centre come to their support. In that case the dragoons can get them in the flank and drive them back. In case of an attack on the centre, we station on this height the central battery, and under its cover we draw off the left flank and retreat to the ravine by platoons,” he reasoned. … All the while he was on the cannon, he heard, as one often does, the sounds of the voices of the officers talking in the shanty, but he did not take in a single word of what they were saying. Suddenly a voice from the shanty impressed him by a tone of such earnestness that he could not help listening.\\n\\n “No, my dear fellow,” said a pleasant voice that seemed somehow familiar to Prince Andrey. “I say that if one could know what will happen after death, then not one of us would be afraid of death. That\u0027s so, my dear fellow.”\\n\\n Another younger voice interrupted him: “But afraid or not afraid, there\u0027s no escaping it.”\\n\\n ‘Why, you\u0027re always in fear! Fie on you learned fellows,” said a third, a manly voice, interrupting both. “To be sure, you artillerymen are clever fellows, because you can carry everything with you to eat and to drink.”\\n\\n And the owner of the manly voice, apparently an infantry officer, laughed.\\n\\n “Still one is in fear,” pursued the first voice, the one Prince Andrey knew. “One\u0027s afraid of the unknown, that\u0027s what it is. It\u0027s all very well to say the soul goes to heaven … but this we do know, that there is no heaven, but only atmosphere.”\\n\\n Again the manly voice interrupted.\\n\\n “Come, give us a drop of your herb-brandy, Tushin,” it said.\\n\\n “Oh, it\u0027s the captain, who had his boots off in the booth,” thought Prince Andrey, recognising with pleasure the agreeable philosophising voice.\\n\\n “Herb-brandy by all means,” said Tushin; “but still to conceive of a future life …” He did not finish his sentence.\\n\\n At that moment there was a whiz heard in the air: nearer, nearer, faster and more distinctly, and faster it came; and the cannon-ball, as though not uttering all it had to say, thudded into the earth not far from the shanty, tearing up the soil with superhuman force. The earth seemed to moan at the terrible blow. At the same instant there dashed out of the shanty, before any of the rest, little Tushin with his short pipe in his mouth; his shrewd, good-humoured face was rather pale. After him emerged the owner of the manly voice, a stalwart infantry officer, who ran off to his company, buttoning his coat as he ran.\\n\\n 诚然，从那座炮台上庶几展现出俄军和大部分敌军驻地的全貌。在对面山岗的地平线上，正好面对炮台，可以望见申格拉本村，在离本村两侧不远的地方，在法军生起篝火的滚滚黑烟中已有三处可以分辨清一大批法军，显然大部分法军都在本村和山后设营。村子左边，在一股浓烟中似乎可以看见某种形似炮台的东西，可是用肉眼就分辨不清楚了。我军的右翼位于颇为陡峭的高地，它耸立于法军阵地之上。高地上分布着我军的步兵，紧靠边缘的地方可以看见龙骑兵。图申主管的炮台位于中央，安德烈公爵从炮台上观察阵地，中央地带有一条笔直的缓坡路和通往小河的上坡路，这条小河把我们和申格拉本村分隔开来。我军右方与森林毗连，砍伐木柴的步兵生起的篝火冒着一股轻烟。法军的战线比我军的战线更宽，一目了然，法国官兵不难从两面包抄我们。我军阵地后面有一座陡峭的万仞深谷，炮兵和骑兵很难从峡谷退却。安德烈公爵用臂肘支撑着炮身，他取出记事簿，给自己画了一张军队部署图。他用铅笔在两处作了记号，打算向巴格拉季翁汇报一番。他想，首先把全部炮兵集中在中央阵地，其二，朝峡谷方向调回骑兵部队。安德烈公爵常在总司令近侧，注意群众的运作和一般的指令，并经常研究战争史文献，对行将爆发的战斗，情不自禁地想到军事行动进程的梗概。他脑海中只是浮现出如下严重的偶然事件：“如果敌军攻打右翼，”他自言自语地说，“基辅掷弹兵团和波多尔斯克猎骑兵团就要在中央援军尚未抵达之前坚守阵地。在这种情况下，龙骑兵可能要打击侧翼部队，把他们粉碎。敌人一旦进攻中央阵地，我们就要在这个高地上布置中央炮台，并且在炮台掩护下集结左翼部队，列成梯队撤退到峡谷。”他自言自语地评论……\\n\\n 当他在炮台上一门大炮旁边停留的时候，他便像平常那样不断地听见那些在棚子里说话的军官的嗓音，但是他们说什么，他连一个词也不明白。突然棚子里传来几个人的嗓音，这使他感到惊奇，他们说话的声调十分亲切，扣人心弦，以致他情不自禁地倾听起来。\\n\\n “不，亲爱的，”传来一阵悦耳的好像是安德烈公爵熟悉的话语声，“我是说，假如有办法知道未来的事，那末我们之中就没有人会怕死了。亲爱的，的确如此。”\\n\\n 另外一个更加年轻的汉子的嗓音打断了他的话。\\n\\n “怕也好，不怕也好，横竖一样——死是不可避免的。”\\n\\n “不过还是害怕啊！嗨，你们都是很有阅历的人，”又传来一阵勇敢者的话语声，把前二者的话打断了，“真的，你们这些炮兵之所以很有阅历，是因为你们把样样东西随身带来了：伏特加酒呀，小菜呀，要什么有什么。”\\n\\n 嗓音雄厚的汉子显然是步兵军官，他大声笑起来了。\\n\\n “不过还是害怕啊！”头一位带有熟悉的嗓音的人继续说下去，“害怕未知的事事物物，真是如此。无论怎么说，灵魂终有一日要升天……我们本来就知道，上天是不存在的，只有大气层而已。”\\n\\n 勇敢者的嗓音又把炮兵的话打断了。\\n\\n “喂，图申，请我喝点您的草浸酒吧。”他说道。\\n\\n “他就是那个不穿皮靴站在随军商贩身边的上尉。”安德烈公爵思忖了片刻，高兴地听出令人悦意的富有抽象推理意味的发言。\\n\\n “可以请您喝一点草浸酒，”图申说道，“还是要明了未来的人生……”他没有把话说完。\\n\\n 这时候空中传来一片呼啸声。愈来愈近，愈快，愈清晰，愈清晰，愈快，一枚炮弹好像没有把要说的话全部说完，就带着非人的威力炸成了碎片，在离棚子不远的地方轰隆一声落在地上。大地因为遭受到可怖的打击而发出一声叹息。\\n\\n 就在这一刹那间，身材矮小的图申歪歪地叼着一根烟斗第一个从棚子里急忙跑出来，他那善良而聪明的面孔显得有几分苍白。嗓音雄厚的汉子，英姿勃勃的步兵军官跟在他后面走出来，向他自己的连队迅跑而去，跑步时，扣上军衣的钮扣。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3339.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
