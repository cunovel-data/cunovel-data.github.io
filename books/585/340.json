{"id":41315,"no":340,"title":"Epilogue 1 Chapter 8","content":"THE ONE THING that sometimes troubled Nikolay in his government of his serfs was his hasty temper and his old habit, acquired in the hussars, of making free use of his fists. At first he saw nothing blameworthy in this, but in the second year of his married life his views on that form of correction underwent a sudden change.\\n\\n One summer day he had sent for the village elder who had taken control at Bogutcharovo on the death of Dron. The man was accused of various acts of fraud and neglect. Nikolay went out to the steps to see him, and at the first answers the village elder made, shouts and blows were heard in the hall. On going back indoors to lunch, Nikolay went up to his wife, who was sitting with her head bent low over her embroidery frame, and began telling her, as he always did, everything that had interested him during the morning, and among other things about the Bogutcharovo elder. Countess Marya, turning red and pale and setting her lips, sat in the same pose, making no reply to her husband.\\n\\n “The insolent rascal,” he said, getting hot at the mere recollection. “Well, he should have told me he was drunk, he did not see … Why, what is it, Marie?” he asked all at once.\\n\\n Countess Marya raised her head, tried to say something, but hurriedly looked down again, trying to control her lips.\\n\\n “What is it? What is wrong, my darling? …” His plain wife always looked her best when she was in tears. She never wept for pain or anger, but always from sadness and pity. And when she wept her luminous eyes gained an indescribable charm.\\n\\n As soon as Nikolay took her by the hand, she was unable to restrain herself, and burst into tears.\\n\\n “Nikolay, I saw … he was in fault, but you, why did you! Nikolay!” and she hid her face in her hands.\\n\\n Nikolay did not speak; he flushed crimson, and walking away from her, began pacing up and down in silence. He knew what she was crying about, but he could not all at once agree with her in his heart that what he had been used to from childhood, what he looked upon as a matter of course, was wrong. “It\u0027s sentimental nonsense, old wives\u0027 cackle—or is she right?” he said to himself. Unable to decide that question, he glanced once more at her suffering and loving face, and all at once he felt that she was right, and that he had known himself to be in fault a long time before.\\n\\n “Marie,” he said, softly, going up to her: “it shall never happen again; I give you my word. Never,” he repeated in a shaking voice like a boy begging for forgiveness.\\n\\n The tears flowed faster from his wife\u0027s eyes. She took his hand and kissed it.\\n\\n “Nikolay, when did you break your cameo?” she said to change the subject, as she scrutinised the finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of Laocoon.\\n\\n “To-day; it was all the same thing. O Marie, don\u0027t remind me of it!” He flushed again. “I give you my word of honour that it shall never happen again. And let this be a reminder to me for ever,” he said, pointing to the broken ring.\\n\\n From that time forward, whenever in interviews with his village elders and foremen he felt the blood rush to his face and his fists began to clench, Nikolay turned the ring round on his finger and dropped his eyes before the man who angered him. Twice a year, however, he would forget himself, and then, going to his wife, he confessed, and again promised that this would really be the last time.\\n\\n “Marie, you must despise me,” he said to her. “I deserve it.”\\n\\n “You must run away, make haste and run away if you feel yourself unable to control yourself,” his wife said mournfully, trying to comfort him.\\n\\n In the society of the nobility of the province Nikolay was respected but not liked. The local politics of the nobility did not interest him. And in consequence he was looked upon by some people as proud and by others as a fool. In summer his whole time from the spring sowing to the harvest was spent in looking after the land. In the autumn he gave himself up with the same business-like seriousness to hunting, going out for a month or two at a time with his huntsmen, dogs, and horses on hunting expeditions. In the winter he visited their other properties and spent his time in reading, chiefly historical books, on which he spent a certain sum regularly every year. He was forming for himself, as he used to say, a serious library, and he made it a principle to read through every book he bought. He would sit over his book in his study with an important air; and what he had at first undertaken as a duty became an habitual pursuit, which afforded him a special sort of gratification in the feeling that he was engaged in serious study. Except when he went on business to visit their other estates, he spent the winter at home with his family, entering into all the petty cares and interests of the mother and children. With his wife he got on better and better, every day discovering fresh spiritual treasures in her.\\n\\n From the time of Nikolay\u0027s marriage Sonya had lived in his house. Before their marriage, Nikolay had told his wife all that had passed between him and Sonya, blaming himself and praising her conduct. He begged Princess Marya to be kind and affectionate to his cousin. His wife was fully sensible of the wrong her husband had done his cousin; she felt herself too guilty toward Sonya; she fancied her wealth had influenced Nikolay in his choice, could find no fault in Sonya, and wished to love her. But she could not like her, and often found evil feelings in her soul in regard to her, which she could not overcome.\\n\\n One day she was talking with her friend Natasha of Sonya and her own injustice towards her.\\n\\n “Do you know what,” said Natasha; “you have read the Gospel a great deal; there is a passage there that applies exactly to Sonya.”\\n\\n “What is it?” Countess Marya asked in surprise.\\n\\n “ ‘To him that hath shall be given, and to him that hath not shall be taken even that that he hath,\u0027 do you remember? She is the one that hath not; why, I don\u0027t know; perhaps she has no egoism. I don\u0027t know; but from her is taken away, and everything has been taken away. I am sometimes awfully sorry for her. I used in old days to want Nikolay to marry her but I always had a sort of presentiment that it would not happen. She is a barren flower, you know, like what one finds among the strawberry flowers. Sometimes I am sorry for her, and sometimes I think she does not feel it as we should have felt it.”\\n\\n And although Countess Marya argued with Natasha that those words of the Gospel must not be taken in that sense, looking at Sonya, she agreed with the explanation given by Natasha. It did seem really as though Sonya did not feel her position irksome, and was quite reconciled to her fate as a barren flower. She seemed to be fond not so much of people as of the whole family. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to persons but to the house. She waited on the old countess, petted and spoiled the children, was always ready to perform small services, which she seemed particularly clever at; but all she did was unconsciously taken for granted, without much gratitude.…\\n\\n The Bleak Hills house had been built up again, but not on the same scale as under the old prince.\\n\\n The buildings, begun in days of straitened means, were more than simple. The immense mansion on the old stone foundation was of wood, plastered only on the inside. The great rambling house, with its unstained plank floors, was furnished with the simplest rough sofas and chairs and tables made of their own birch-trees by the labor of their serf carpenters. The house was very roomy, with quarters for the house-serfs and accommodation for visitors.\\n\\n The relations of the Rostovs and the Bolkonskys would sometimes come on visits to Bleak Hills with their families, sixteen horses and dozens of servants, and stay for months. And four times a year—on the namedays and birthdays of the master and mistress—as many as a hundred visitors would be put up for a day or two. The rest of the year the regular life of the household went on in unbroken routine, with its round of duties, and of teas, breakfasts, dinners, and suppers, all provided out of home-grown produce.\\n\\n 夏天，有一次他派人把顶替博古恰罗沃已故村长德龙的新村长叫来，因为有人控告他营私舞弊、玩忽职守。尼古拉走到门口去见他，村长刚回答了几句，门厅里就传出了尼古拉大喊大叫、拳打脚踢的声音。尼古拉回家吃早饭，走到低着头正在绣花的妻子跟前，照例把早餐的活动讲给她听，顺便提到博古恰罗伏村长的事。玛丽亚伯爵夫人脸上一阵红，一阵白，抿紧嘴唇，一直低头坐着，对丈夫的话没有答腔。\\n\\n “这个无法无天的混蛋，”尼古拉一想到他就生气。并且说，“他要是对我说喝醉酒倒也罢了，真没见过……你怎么了，玛丽亚？”他突然问。\\n\\n 玛丽亚伯爵夫人抬起头来想说什么，但立刻又低下头，抿紧嘴唇。\\n\\n “你怎么了？你怎么了？亲爱的？……”\\n\\n 玛丽亚伯爵夫人长得并不漂亮，但她一哭起来就显得楚楚动人。她从来不为痛苦和烦恼而哭泣，却常常由于感伤和怜悯而落泪。她一哭，那双明亮的眼睛就具有令人倾倒的魅力。\\n\\n 尼古拉刚拉起她的手，她就忍不住哭起来。\\n\\n “尼古拉，我知道…是他不对，可你，你为什么要那样！\\n\\n 尼古拉……”她说着，用双手捂着脸。\\n\\n 尼古拉不作声、脸涨得通红，从她身旁走开，默默地在房里踱来踱去。他明白她为什么哭，但要他把从小就习惯的事看作错误，他一下还转不过弯来。\\n\\n “这是她热心快肠，习惯于婆婆妈妈，还是她对呢？”尼古拉在心里问自己。他不能解答这个问题，又瞟了一眼她那痛苦而可爱的脸。于是他突然明白她是对的，而他早就错了。\\n\\n “玛丽，”①他走到她面前轻轻地说，“以后再也不这样了，我向你保证。绝不会再发生这种事了。”他像一个请求饶恕的孩子，用颤抖的声音重复地说。\\n\\n 伯爵夫人的泪水流得更多了。她拿起丈夫的手吻了吻。\\n\\n “尼古拉，你什么时候把头像打碎了？”为了改变话题，她望着他戴着拉奥孔②头像戒指的手说。 \\n\\n ①此处原文用爱称—Mapu。\\n\\n ②拉奥孔是希腊神话中普里阿摩斯和赫卡柏的儿子，阿波罗在特洛伊城的祭司。他警告特洛伊人提防水马计，为此而触怒天神雅典娜，结果拉奥孔同其二子被巨蟒缠死。\\n\\n 从那以后，每逢尼古拉同村长和管家发生争执，血往脸上直涌，双手紧攥拳头时，他就转动套在手指上的那枚打碎的戒指，于是，尼古接就在惹他生气的人面前，垂下眼皮。但他一年总有一两次忘记自己的诺言，这时尼古拉就走到妻子面前认错，并保证以后决不再犯。\\n\\n “玛丽，你一定瞧不起我了？”他对她说。“我这是自作自受。”\\n\\n “如果你觉得控制不住自己的情绪，那你就走开，尽快地走开。”伯爵夫人忧愁地说，竭力安慰丈夫。\\n\\n 在本省贵族圈子里，尼古拉受人尊敬，却不讨人喜欢。他对贵族利益不感兴趣，因此有人认为他高傲，有人认为他愚蠢。整个夏天，从春播到秋收，他都忙于农事。秋天，他以从事农务那样的认真精神，带着猎人和猎犬外出打猎，一去就是一两个月。冬天他到各地村庄去看看或者读书。他主要读历史书，每年花钱不少。正如他所说，他收藏了不少书，凡是买来的书照例都要读完。他一本正经地坐在书斋里读书，起初是作为一种任务，后来成为一种习惯，从中体验到特殊的乐趣，并觉得读书是件正经事。冬天除了出门办事之外，他大部分时间都待在家里，同母亲和孩子一起做些杂事，享受天伦之乐。他同妻子的关系越来越亲密，每天都从她身上发现新的精神财富。\\n\\n 尼古拉婚后，索尼娅仍住在他家里。结婚以前，他就把他同索尼娅的关系全都告诉了自己的未婚妻，他一面责怪自己，一面称赞索尼娅。他请求玛丽亚好好对待表妹。玛丽亚伯爵夫人知道自己的丈夫对不起索尼娅，同时自己对索尼娅也感到内心有愧。她明白，是她的家产影响了尼古拉的选择。她丝毫也不能责怪索尼娅，而是应当喜欢她。但事实上她不仅不爱索尼娅心里还常常恨她，而且无法克制这种感情。\\n\\n 有一次，她同她的朋友娜塔莎谈到索尼娅，并谈到自己对她的不公正。\\n\\n “你听我说，”娜塔莎说，“你读了多遍《福音书》，其中有一个地方似乎是针对索尼娅说的。”\\n\\n “你说的是那一节？”玛丽亚伯爵夫人惊讶地问。\\n\\n “‘凡有的，还要加给他，没有的，连他所有的，也要夺过来。\u0027①你记得吗？她是那个没有的，为什么，我不知道，也许因为她没有私心，我不知道，但她所有的，全被夺走了。有时候我十分可怜她，以前我真希望尼古拉同她结婚。但我有一种预感，这件事不能可能实现。她就像草莓上开的一朵不结果的花，你知道吗？有时我很可怜她，可有时候又觉得她不会像我们一样感觉到这一点。” \\n\\n ①见《圣经·新约·路加福音》第十九章第二十六节。\\n\\n 童山庄园又翻修了一番，但规模已大不如前，不能与老公爵在世时相比了。\\n\\n 在经济拮据时翻修房屋，工程总是因陋就简。巨大的房屋就建在原来的石基上，全部木结构，内部抹了灰泥。房子很宽敞，地板没有油漆，家具也很简单：几只硬沙发，几张桌椅，这些都是家里的木匠用自己家里的桦木做的。房子是够宽敞的，有下房也有客房。罗斯托夫家和博尔孔斯基家的亲戚，有时候带着十六匹马和几十个仆人，全身来到童山，一住就是几个月。此外，逢到男女主人的命名日和生日，每年四次就有上百个客人到童山来聚上个一两天。一年中的其他时间，生活则几乎一成不变，有日常的工作，按时饮茶，用庄园自产的食品准备早餐、午餐和晚餐。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3638.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
