{"id":41157,"no":182,"title":"Book 9 Chapter 19","content":"EVER SINCE THE DAY when Pierre had looked up at the comet in the sky on his way home from the Rostovs\u0027, and recalling Natasha\u0027s grateful look, had felt as though some new vista was opening before him, the haunting problem of the vanity and senselessness of all things earthly had ceased to torment him. That terrible question: Why? what for? which had till then haunted him in the midst of every occupation, was not now replaced by any other question, nor by an answer to the old question; its place was filled by the image of her. If he heard or talked of trivialities, or read or was told of some instance of human baseness or folly, he was not cast down as of old; he did not ask himself why people troubled, when all was so brief and uncertain. But he thought of her as he had seen her last, and all his doubts vanished; not because she had answered the questions that haunted him, but because her image lifted him instantly into another bright realm of spiritual activity, in which there could be neither right nor wrong, into a region of beauty and love which was worth living for. Whatever infamy he thought of, he said to himself, “Well, let so and so rob the state and the Tsar, while the state and the Tsar heap honours on him; but she smiled at me yesterday, and begged me to come, and I love her, and nobody will ever know it,” he thought.\\n\\n Pierre still went into society, drank as much, and led the same idle and aimless life, because, apart from the hours he spent at the Rostovs\u0027, he had to get through the rest of his time somehow, and the habits and the acquaintances he had made in Moscow drew him irresistibly into the same life. But of late, since the reports from the seat of war had become more and more disquieting, and Natasha\u0027s health had improved, and she had ceased to call for the same tender pity, he had begun to be more and more possessed by a restlessness that he could not explain. He felt that the position he was in could not go on for long, that a catastrophe was coming that would change the whole course of his life, and he sought impatiently for signs of this impending catastrophe. One of his brother masons had revealed to Pierre the following prophecy relating to Napoleon, and taken from the Apocalypse of St. John.\\n\\n In the Apocalypse, chapter thirteen, verse seventeen, it is written: “Here is wisdom; let him that hath understanding, count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred three-score and six.”\\n\\n And in the fifth verse of the same chapter: “And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.”\\n\\n If the French alphabet is treated like the Hebrew system of enumeration, by which the first ten letters represent the units, and the next the tens, and so on, the letters have the following value:—\\n\\n Turning out the words l\u0027empereur Napoléon into ciphers on this system, it happens that the sum of these numbers equals 666, and Napoleon is thereby seen to be the beast prophesied in the Apocalypse. Moreover, working out in the same way the words quarante-deux, that is, the term for which the beast was permitted to continue, the sum of these numbers again equals 666, from which it is deduced that the terms of Napoleon\u0027s power had come in 1812, when the French Emperor reached his forty-second year. This prophecy made a great impression on Pierre. He frequently asked himself what would put an end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon; and he tried by the same system of turning letters into figures, and reckoning them up to find an answer to this question. He wrote down as an answer, l\u0027empereur Alexandre? La nation russe? He reckoned out the figures, but their sum was far more or less than 666. Once he wrote down his own name “Comte Pierre Bezuhov,” but the sum of the figure was far from being right. He changed the spelling, putting s for z, added “de,” added the article “le,” and still could not obtain the desired result. Then it occurred to him that if the answer sought for were to be found in his name, his nationality ought surely to find a place in it too. He tried Le russe Besuhof, and adding up the figure made the sum 671. This was only five too much; the 5 was denoted by the letter “e,” the letter dropped in the article in the expression l\u0027empereur Napoléon. Dropping the “e” in a similar way, though of course incorrectly, Pierre obtained the answer he sought in L\u0027russe Besuhof, the letters of which on that system added up to 666. This discovery greatly excited him. How, by what connection, he was associated with the great event, foretold in the Apocalypse, he could not tell. But he did not for a moment doubt of that connection. His love for Natasha, Antichrist, Napoleon\u0027s invasion, the comet, the number 666, l\u0027empereur Napoléon, and l\u0027russe Besuhof—all he thought were to develop, and come to some crisis together to extricate him from that spellbound, trivial round of Moscow habits, to which he felt himself in bondage, and to lead him to some great achievement and great happiness.\\n\\n The day before that Sunday on which the new prayer had been read in the churches, Pierre had promised the Rostovs to call on Count Rastoptchin, whom he knew well, and to get from him the Tsar\u0027s appeal to the country, and the last news from the army. On going to Count Rastoptchin\u0027s in the morning, Pierre found there a special courier, who had only just arrived from the army. The courier was a man whom Pierre knew, and often saw at the Moscow balls.\\n\\n “For mercy\u0027s sake, couldn\u0027t you relieve me of some of my burden,” said the courier; “I have a sack full of letters to parents.”\\n\\n Among these letters was a letter from Nikolay Rostov to his father. Pierre took that; and Count Rastoptchin gave him a copy of the Tsar\u0027s appeal to Moscow, which had just been printed, the last announcements in the army, and his own last placard. Looking through the army announcements, Pierre found in one of them, among lists of wounded, killed and promoted, the name of Nikolay Rostov, rewarded with the order of St. George, of the fourth degree, for distinguished bravery in the Ostrovna affair, and in the same announcement the appointment of Prince Andrey Bolkonsky to the command of a regiment of light cavalry. Though he did not want to remind the Rostovs of Bolkonsky\u0027s existence, Pierre could not resist the inclination to rejoice their hearts with the news of their son\u0027s decoration. Keeping the Tsar\u0027s appeal, Rastoptchin\u0027s placard, and the other announcement to bring with him at dinner-time, Pierre sent the printed announcement and Nikolay\u0027s letter to the Rostovs.\\n\\n The conversation with Rastoptchin, and his tone of anxiety and hurry, the meeting with the courier, who had casually alluded to the disastrous state of affairs in the army, the rumours of spies being caught in Moscow, of a sheet circulating in the town stating that Napoleon had sworn to be in both capitals before autumn, of the Tsar\u0027s expected arrival next day—all combined to revive in Pierre with fresh intensity that feeling of excitement and expectation, that he had been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and with even greater force since the beginning of the war.\\n\\n The idea of entering the army had long before occurred to Pierre, and he would have acted upon it, but that, in the first place, he was pledged by his vow to the Masonic brotherhood, which preached universal peace and the abolition of war; and secondly, when he looked at the great mass of Moscow gentlemen, who put on uniforms, and professed themselves patriots, he felt somehow ashamed to take the same step. A cause that weighed with him even more in not entering the army was the obscure conception that he, l\u0027russe Besuhof, had somehow the mystic value of the number of the beast, 666, that his share in putting a limit to the power of the beast, “speaking great things and blasphemies,” had been ordained from all eternity, and that therefore it was not for him to take any step whatever; it was for him to wait for what was bound to come to pass.\\n\\n “就让某人去盗窃国家和沙皇吧，而国家和沙皇赐给他荣誉；可她昨天向我微笑，要我去。我爱她，任何人无论何时都不了解这一点。”他想。\\n\\n 皮埃尔仍是那样出入交际场所，仍是喝很多酒，仍是那样过着悠闲懒散的生活，因为除了他在罗斯托夫家消度时光外，他还要打发剩余的时间，于是习惯和那些他在莫斯科结交的老相识不可抗拒地把他吸引到那种把他据为己有的生活去。但是，最近当从战地传来越来越令人不安的消息时，当娜塔莎逐渐康复且在他心目中她不再唤起他那有所节制的怜悯感情时，一种莫名其妙的烦躁情绪愈益萦绕着他。他感觉到他现在所处状态不能持续多久了，一场必然改变他全部生活的惨剧将要临头，他急不可耐地搜寻这场逐渐逼近的惨剧的全部预兆。共济会的一位道友告诉皮埃尔一个引自圣约翰《启示录》中有关拿破仑的预言。\\n\\n 《启示录》第十三章十八节说：“这里有智慧；拥有聪慧的，可以计算兽的数目：因为这是人的数目，他的数目是六百六十六。”\\n\\n 同一章第五节说：“又赐给他说夸大话亵渎话的口；又有权柄赐予他，可以任意而行四十二个月。”\\n\\n 法文字母按照希伯来文字母数值排列起来，其前九个字母表示个位，而其余字母表示十位，就得出下列意义：\\n\\n abcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789102030405060708090100110120130140150160\\n\\n 根据这个字母表，把词l\u0027empereur　Napoléon①的字母换成数字，其总和为六百六十六，所以，拿破仑就是《启示录》中预言的那只兽。此外，再按此字母表，把那个“说夸大话亵渎话”的兽的限期quarante　deux②写成数字，又正好是六百六十六，由上得出，拿破仑政权到1812年就满期了，该年这位法国皇帝满四十二岁。这个预言使皮埃尔很吃惊，他经常问自己，究竟是什么决定了那只兽也就是拿破仑的权限期，他根据那个字母的数字来计算，极力要找出使他感兴趣的问题的答案。皮埃尔写出这个问题的答案：l\u0027empereur　Alexandre？La　Nation　Russe？③他计算字母的数字，可数字的总和不是大大超过，就是小于六百六十六。有一次，作这种计算时，他写出了自己的名字——Comte　Pierre　BeBsouhoff；数字的总和也差得多。他改变拼法，把Z用S代替，加上de再加上article④，最终也未得出预期的结果。忽然他有一个念头，如果问题的答案在他的名字里，那么答案中一定包括他的民族。他写出Le　russe　Besuhof⑤，又计算数据，得到结果为六百七十一。仅仅多出五这个数；e代表五，而e在l\u0027empereur的词前的冠词中可被省略。他照样去掉e，虽然这不正确，于是皮埃尔得到了答案l\u0027russe　Besuhof（等于六百六十六。这个发现使他激动。怎样把他与《启示录》中预言的这伟大的事件联系在一起，他不知道；但是他毫不怀疑这种联系。他对罗斯托娃的爱情，反基督，拿破仑的入侵，彗星，666，l\u0027empereur　Napoléon和l\u0027russe　Besuhof——所有这一切都必然成熟，必然爆发，把他从那着了魔的、毫无价值的莫斯科习惯充斥的世界中拯救出来——他觉得自己在这习惯中被俘虏了，这一切将都引导他建立丰功伟绩和获得伟大幸福。 \\n\\n ①法语：拿破仑皇帝。\\n\\n ②法语：四十二。\\n\\n ③法语：亚历山大皇帝？俄罗斯民族？\\n\\n ④法语：冠词。\\n\\n ⑤法语：俄罗斯人别祖霍夫。\\n\\n 信使是皮埃尔的一位熟人，莫斯科舞会的常客。\\n\\n “看在上帝的面上，您可不可以帮帮我？”信使说，“我有一满口袋家信。”\\n\\n 这些信中，有一封是尼古拉·罗斯托夫寄给他父亲的信，皮埃尔拿了这封信。另外，拉斯托普钦伯爵把刚印好的皇帝《告莫斯科民众书》，刚发给军队的几项命令和最新告示给了皮埃尔，看了看军队的命令。皮埃尔找到载有伤亡和受奖人员的名单，其中有尼古拉·罗斯托夫因在奥斯特罗夫纳战役中表现英勇而被授予四级圣乔治勋章，同一命令中，还有安德烈·博尔孔斯基公爵被任命为猎骑兵团团长。虽然他不愿向罗斯托夫家提起博尔孔斯基，但是，皮埃尔禁不住想用他们儿子获奖的消息，使他们高兴，于是他留下《告民众书》、告示和其他命令以便午饭前亲自带给他们，而把铅印的命令和信打发人先送到罗斯托夫家。\\n\\n 与拉斯托普钦伯爵的谈话，他的腔调忧心忡忡，慌慌张张，与信使相遇，漠不关心地谈及前方军情是多么糟糕，谣传莫斯科发现间谍及遍撒莫斯科的传单，传单上说，拿破仑到秋天要占领俄罗斯两座都城，关于皇帝明天将要莅临的谈论——所有这一切带着新的力量在皮埃尔心中激起躁动和有所期待的感情，自从出现彗星，特别是从战争爆发以来，皮埃尔一直怀着这种感情。\\n\\n 皮埃尔早就有参军服役的思想，假如没有两件事妨碍他这样做的话，他本来可以实现这个愿望。第一，他是共济会会员，受誓言的约束，共济会是宣扬永久和平和消灭战争的；第二，他看着许多莫斯科人穿着军服，宣传着爱国主义，他不知为什么羞于这样做。他未实现自己参军服役的愿望的主要原因，是因为他怀有一个朦胧有意念：L\u0027Russe　Besuhof，是有兽的666数字的意义的，对于结束那头说夸大话亵渎话的兽的权限的伟大事业，早已注定由他完成，因此，他什么也不必做，只须坐待那必然会实现的事情实现。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3480.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
