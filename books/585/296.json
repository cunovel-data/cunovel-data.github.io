{"id":41271,"no":296,"title":"Book 14 Chapter 3","content":"THE SO-CALLED “PARTISAN” WARFARE had begun with the enemy\u0027s entrance into Smolensk. Before the irregular warfare was officially recognised by our government many thousands of the enemy\u0027s soldiers—straggling, marauding, or foraging parties—had been slain by Cossacks and peasants, who killed these men as instinctively as dogs set upon a stray mad dog. Denis Davydov was the first to feel with his Russian instinct the value of this terrible cudgel which belaboured the French, and asked no questions about the etiquette of the military art; and to him belongs the credit of the first step towards the recognition of this method of warfare.\\n\\n The first detachment of irregulars—Davydov\u0027s—was formed on the 24th of August, and others soon followed. In the latter stages of the campaign these detachments became more and more numerous.\\n\\n The irregulars destroyed the Grande Armée piecemeal. They swept up the fallen leaves that were dropping of themselves from the withered tree, and sometimes they shook the tree itself. By October, when the French were fleeing to Smolensk, there were hundreds of these companies, differing widely from one another in number and in character. Some were detachments that followed all the usual routine of an army, with infantry, artillery, staff-officers, and all the conveniences of life. Some consisted only of Cossacks, mounted men. Others were small bands of men, on foot and also mounted. Some consisted of peasants, or of landowners and their serfs, and remained unknown. There was a deacon at the head of such a band, who took several hundred prisoners in a month. There was the village elder\u0027s wife, Vassilisa, who killed hundreds of the French.\\n\\n The latter part of October was the time when this guerilla warfare reached its height. That period of this warfare, in which the irregulars were themselves amazed at their own audacity, were every moment in dread of being surrounded and captured by the French, and never unsaddling, hardly dismounting, hid in the woods, in momentary expectation of pursuit, was already over. The irregular warfare had by now taken definite shape; it had become clear to all the irregulars what they could, and what they could not, accomplish with the French. By now it was only the commanders of detachments marching with staff-officers according to the rules at a distance from the French who considered much impossible. The small bands of irregulars who had been at work a long while, and were at close quarters with the French, found it possible to attempt what the leaders of larger companies did not dare to think of doing. The Cossacks and the peasants, who crept in among the French, thought everything possible now.\\n\\n On the 22nd of October, Denisov, who was a leader of a band of irregulars, was eagerly engaged in a typical operation of this irregular warfare. From early morning he had been with his men moving about the woods that bordered the high road, watching a big convoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners that had dropped behind the other French troops, and under strong escort—as he learned from his scouts and from prisoners—was making its way to Smolensk. Not only Denisov and Dolohov (who was also a leader of a small band acting in the same district) were aware of the presence of this convoy. Some generals in command of some larger detachments, with staff-officers also, knew of this convoy, and, as Denisov said, their mouths were watering for it. Two of these generals—one a Pole, the other a German—had almost at the same time sent to Denisov an invitation to join their respective detachments in attacking the convoy.\\n\\n “No, friend, I wasn\u0027t born yesterday!” said Denisov, on reading these documents; and he wrote to the German that in spite of his ardent desire to serve under so brilliant and renowned a general, he must deprive himself of that happiness because he was already under the command of the Polish general. To the Pole he wrote the same thing, informing him that he was already serving under the command of the German.\\n\\n Having thus disposed of that difficulty, Denisov, without communicating on the subject to the higher authorities, intended with Dolohov to attack and carry off this transport with his own small force. The transport was, on the 22nd of October, going from the village of Mikulino to the village of Shamshevo. On the left side of the road between Mikulino and Shamshevo there were great woods, which in places bordered on the road, and in places were a verst or more from the road. Denisov, with a small party of followers, had been the whole day riding about in these woods, sometimes plunging into their centre, and sometimes coming out at the edge, but never losing sight of the moving French. In the morning, not far from Mikulino, where the wood ran close to the road, the Cossacks of Denisov\u0027s party had pounced on two French waggonloads of saddles, stuck in the mud, and had carried them off into the wood. From that time right on to evening, they had been watching the movements of the French without attacking them. They wanted to avoid frightening them, and to let them go quietly on to Shamshevo, and then, joining Dolohov (who was to come that evening to a trysting-place in the wood, a verst from Shamshevo, to concert measures with them), from two sides to fall at dawn like an avalanche of snow on their heads, and to overcome and capture all of them at a blow.\\n\\n Six Cossacks had been left behind, two versts from Mikulino, where the wood bordered the road. They were to bring word at once as soon as any fresh columns of French came into sight.\\n\\n In front of Shamshevo, Dolohov was in the same way to watch the road to know at what distance there were other French troops. With the transport there were supposed to be fifteen hundred men. Denisov had two hundred men, and Dolohov might have as many more. But superiority in numbers was no obstacle to Denisov. There was only one thing that he still needed to know, and that was what troops these were; and for that object Denisov needed to take a “tongue” (that is, some man belonging to that column of the enemy). The attack on the waggons in the morning was all done with such haste that they killed all the French soldiers in charge of the waggons, and captured alive only a little drummer-boy, who had straggled away from his own regiment, and could tell them nothing certain about the troops forming the column.\\n\\n To make another descent upon them, Denisov thought, would be to risk alarming the whole column, and so he sent on ahead to Shamshevo a peasant, Tihon Shtcherbatov, to try if he could capture at least one of the French quartermasters from the vanguard.\\n\\n 在游击战尚未被政府正式承认之前，已经有数千名法军士兵——掉队的抢掠兵和征粮士兵——被哥萨克和农民杀掉，他们打死这些法军是不自觉的，就像一群狗咬死一条丧家的疯狗一样。杰尼斯·达维多夫，以其俄罗斯人的敏觉，第一个认识到这件可怕的武器的意义，他不管什么战争艺术规则，使用这种武器消灭法国人，使这种战争合法化的首功应归于他。\\n\\n 八月二十四日达维多夫组建了第一支游击队，紧接着别的游击队也组成了。战争愈向前推进，游击队就愈来愈多。\\n\\n 游击队各个歼灭那支大军。他们歼灭那些就像从枯树上掉下的落叶一样的法国军队，他们时而还要摇晃一下这棵枯树。到了十月，也就是法国人往斯摩棱斯克逃跑时，这些大大小小性质各异的游击队就已经发展到有几百个了。有的游击队完全仿效军队，有步兵、骑兵、司令部，携带着生活用品；有的只有哥萨克骑兵；有些是小股的，步兵和骑兵混杂的，还有些是谁也弄不清是从哪里来的农民和地主。有一个游击队的头头是一所教堂的勤杂工，他在一个月的时间里抓获了几百名俘虏。有一个村长的老婆名叫瓦西里萨，她一个人打死了几百个法国人。\\n\\n 十月下旬，游击战争达到高潮。这是战争的第一阶段，在这一阶段，游击队自己都为他们的胆大而吃惊，他们时刻提防着被法军活捉或者被包围，因此，他们总是马不离鞍，人不离马，隐藏在森林里，俟机袭击敌人，现在，这一阶段已成为过去。战争已明朗化，人人都知道，应当怎样和法国人进行斗争。此刻只有那些建立有司令部的大游击队的头头们把他们的司令部设在离法国人较远的地方，他们仍然认为有许多事情是不可能办得到的。那些早就开始战斗，总是在近处窥视法国人行动的小股游击队，他们认为那些大的游击队队长们连想都不敢想的事情，他们也能办到。哥萨克和农民们潜入法国人之中，他们则认为，现在一切都能办到。\\n\\n 十月二十二日，游击队员杰尼索夫和他的伙伴们斗志昂扬，一大早他们就开始行动。他们全天都在靠近大路的森林中监视一支押运骑兵物资和俄国俘虏的队伍，他们与其余法军距离较远，但加强了掩护，据俘虏的口供和侦察员的报告，证实了是开往斯摩棱斯克的。获悉这支运输队行动的不仅是杰尼索夫和在杰尼索夫附近活动的多洛霍夫（他也率领了一支不大的游击队），而且还有几个建有司令部的大游击队；大家都获悉了这支运输队的行动，正如杰尼索夫所说，大家都磨拳擦掌。这些大游击队中有两个队的头头——一个是波兰人，另一个是德国人——差不多同时给杰尼索夫来信，邀请杰尼索夫与他们联手来袭击这支运输队。\\n\\n “不行呵，老兄，我也是长了胡子的人啦，”杰尼索夫边读来信，边自言自语地说，他给德国人的回信中说，虽然他由衷地愿意在骁勇善战、赫赫有名的将军麾下的服务，但是他不得不放弃这一幸福，因为他已置身于波兰将军的指挥之下。他又写了一封同样的内容的信给波兰将军，告诉他，他已经归德国人指挥了。\\n\\n 杰尼索夫是这样安排的，这次行动不向上级报告，他联合多洛霍夫，以这两支兵力并不多的队伍去袭击并截获这个法国运输队。十月二十二日运输队从米库林纳村出发，当天前方宿营地是沙姆舍沃村。从米库林纳到沙姆舍沃沿途左边是大森林，有的地方森林临近大路旁边，有的地方离大路有一里路或一里多路。杰尼索夫骑着马和同伴们一整天在森林中和法国这支运输队一道往前走，他们时而进入森林中间，有时走到林边，然而他们始终把法国人置于自己监视之下。一早，才离开米库林纳村不远，路边就是森林，有两辆车陷进泥里，车上载的是骑兵用的马鞍，杰尼索夫的游击队轻易就截获了这两辆大车，然后把他们带进林中。在此之后，整个白天，游击队没有发动攻击，只是监视着法国人的行动，并不惊动他们。让他们顺利地抵达沙姆舍沃村，在那里，他和多洛霍夫一道进行袭击。多洛霍夫按约在傍晚时分来到离沙姆舍沃村一里多路的看林人的小屋商谈，预计次日黎明行动，两面夹击，像雪崩一样打他个劈头盖脑，歼灭运输队并缴获全部物资。\\n\\n 游击队在米库林纳和沙姆舍沃的两端布置了监视岗哨，在米库林纳村后两里路，森林靠近大路的地方，布置了六名哥萨克，只要一有法国军队出现，就立刻报告。\\n\\n 同样地，在沙姆舍沃村的前方，多洛霍夫也派人监视着大路，要弄清楚，在离此多远处还有别的法国军队。运输队约有一千五百人，杰尼索夫有二百来人，多洛霍夫也差不多，法国军队在数量上占优势，这并没有使杰尼索夫胆怯。他只需要知道一件事，这就是这支运输队究竟是什么兵种，为此目的，杰尼索夫需要捉一个“舌头”（即活捉一名敌军）。早上袭击那两辆大车时，干得太急促了，把押车的法国人全打死了，只活捉了一个小鼓手，这个像孩子的士兵是掉了队的，他一点也说不清那个运输队是什么兵种。\\n\\n 进行第二次袭击，杰尼索夫认为是危险的。为了不惊动法国人，他派了一名曾在他的游击队当过队员的农民吉洪·谢尔巴特到前面的沙姆舍沃村去，只要有可能，哪怕活捉一个运输队派去打前站的士兵也好。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3594.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
