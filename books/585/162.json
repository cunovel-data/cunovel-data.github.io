{"id":41137,"no":162,"title":"Book 8 Chapter 21","content":"PIERRE drove to Marya Dmitryevna\u0027s to report to her the execution of her commands, as to Kuragin\u0027s banishment from Moscow. The whole house was in excitement and alarm. Natasha was very ill; and as Marya Dmitryevna told him in secret, she had on the night after she had been told Anatole was married, taken arsenic, which she had procured by stealth. After swallowing a little, she had been so frightened that she waked Sonya, and told her what she had done. Antidotes had been given in time, and now she was out of danger; but she was still so weak, that they could not dream of moving her to the country, and the countess had been sent for. Pierre saw the count in great trouble, and Sonya in tears, but he could not see Natasha.\\n\\n That day Pierre dined at the club, and heard on every side gossip about the attempted abduction of the young Countess Rostov, and persistently denied the story, assuring every one that the only foundation for it was that his brother-in-law had made the young lady an offer and had been refused. It seemed to Pierre that it was part of his duty to conceal the whole affair, and to save the young countess\u0027s reputation.\\n\\n He was looking forward with terror to Prince Andrey\u0027s return, and drove round every day to ask for news of him from the old prince.\\n\\n Prince Nikolay Andreitch heard all the rumours current in the town through Mademoiselle Bourienne; and he had read the note to Princess Marya, in which Natasha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits than usual, and looked forward with impatience to seeing his son.\\n\\n A few days after Anatole\u0027s departure, Pierre received a note from Prince Andrey to inform him that he had arrived, and to beg him to go and see him.\\n\\n The first minute of Prince Andrey\u0027s arrival in Moscow, he was handed by his father Natasha\u0027s note to Princess Marya, in which she broke off her engagement (the note had been stolen from Princess Marya, and given to the old prince by Mademoiselle Bourienne). He heard from his father\u0027s lips the story of Natasha\u0027s elopement, with additions.\\n\\n Prince Andrey had arrived in the evening; Pierre came to see him the following morning. Pierre had expected to find Prince Andrey almost in the same state as Natasha, and he was therefore surprised when as he entered the drawing-room he heard the sound of Prince Andrey\u0027s voice in the study, loudly and eagerly discussing some Petersburg intrigue. The old prince and some other voice interrupted him from time to time. Princess Marya came out to meet Pierre. She sighed, turning her eyes towards the door of the room, where Prince Andrey was, plainly intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow; but Pierre saw by Princess Marya\u0027s face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news of his fiancée\u0027s treachery.\\n\\n “He said he had expected it,” she said. “I know his pride will not allow him to express his feelings; but anyway, he has borne it better, far better, than I had expected. It seems it was to be so …”\\n\\n “But is it all really at an end?” said Pierre.\\n\\n Princess Marya looked at him with surprise. She could not understand how one could ask such a question. Pierre went into the study. Prince Andrey was very much changed, and visibly much more robust, but there was a new horizontal line between his brows. He was in civilian dress, and standing facing his father and Prince Meshtchersky, he was hotly arguing, making vigorous gesticulations.\\n\\n The subject was Speransky, of whose sudden dismissal and supposed treason news had just reached Moscow.\\n\\n “Now he” (Speransky) “will be criticised and condemned by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago,” Prince Andrey was saying, “and were incapable of understanding his aims. It\u0027s very easy to condemn a man when he\u0027s out of favour, and to throw upon him the blame of all the mistakes of other people. But I maintain that if anything of value has been done in the present reign, it has been done by him—by him alone …” He stopped, seeing Pierre. His face quivered, and at once assumed a vindictive expression. “And posterity will do him justice,” he finished, and at once turned to Pierre. “Well, how are you, still getting stouter?” he said eagerly, but the new line was still more deeply furrowed on his forehead. “Yes, I\u0027m very well,” he answered to Pierre\u0027s question, and he smiled. It was clear to Pierre that his smile meant, “I am well, but my health is of no use to any one now.”\\n\\n After saying a few words to Pierre of the awful road from the frontiers of Poland, of people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, and of M. Dessalle, whom he had brought back from Switzerland as a tutor for his son, Prince Andrey warmly took part again in the conversation about Speransky, which had been kept up between the two old gentlemen.\\n\\n “If there had been treason, and there were proofs of his secret relations with Napoleon, they would have made them public,” he said, with heat and haste. “I don\u0027t and I didn\u0027t like Speransky personally, but I do like justice.”\\n\\n Pierre recognized now in his friend that desire he knew only too well, for excitement and discussion of something apart from himself, simply in order to stifle thoughts that were too painful and too near his heart.\\n\\n When Prince Meshtchersky had gone, Prince Andrey took Pierre\u0027s arm, and asked him to come to the room that had been assigned him. In that room there was a folding bedstead and open trunks and boxes. Prince Andrey went up to one of them and took out a case. Out of the case he took a packet of letters. He did all this in silence, and very rapidly. He stood up again and cleared his throat. His face was frowning, and his lips set.\\n\\n “Forgive me, if I\u0027m troubling you …” Pierre saw that Prince Andrey was going to speak of Natasha, and his broad face showed sympathy and pity. That expression in Pierre\u0027s face exasperated Prince Andrey. He went on resolutely, clearly, and disagreeably: “I have received a refusal from Countess Rostov, and rumours have reached me of your brother-in-law\u0027s seeking her hand, or something of the kind. Is that true?”\\n\\n “Both true and untrue,” began Pierre; but Prince Andrey cut him short.\\n\\n “Here are her letters and her portrait,” he said. He took the packet from the table and gave it to Pierre.\\n\\n “Give that to the countess … if you will see her.”\\n\\n “She is very ill,” said Pierre.\\n\\n “So she\u0027s still here?” said Prince Andrey. “And Prince Kuragin?” he asked quickly.\\n\\n “He has been gone a long while. She has been at death\u0027s door.”\\n\\n “I am very sorry to hear of her illness,” said Prince Andrey. He laughed a cold, malignant, unpleasant laugh like his father\u0027s.\\n\\n “But M. Kuragin, then, did not deign to bestow his hand on Countess Rostov?” said Prince Andrey. He snorted several times.\\n\\n “He could not have married her, because he is married,” said Pierre.\\n\\n Prince Andrey laughed unpleasantly, again recalling his father.\\n\\n “And where is he now, your brother-in-law, may I ask?” he said.\\n\\n “He went to Peter … but, really, I don\u0027t know,” said Pierre.\\n\\n “Well, that\u0027s no matter,” said Prince Andrey. “Tell Countess Rostov from me that she was and is perfectly free, and that I wish her all prosperity.”\\n\\n Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrey, as though reflecting whether he had not something more to say, or waiting for Pierre to say something, looked at him with a fixed gaze.\\n\\n “Listen. Do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?” said Pierre. “Do you remember about—?”\\n\\n “I remember,” Prince Andrey answered hurriedly. “I said that a fallen woman should be forgiven, but I did not say I could forgive one. I can\u0027t.”\\n\\n “How can you compare it? …” said Pierre.\\n\\n Prince Andrey cut him short. He cried harshly: “Yes, ask her hand again, be magnanimous, and all that sort of thing? … Oh, that\u0027s all very noble, but I\u0027m not equal to following in that gentleman\u0027s tracks. If you care to remain my friend, never speak to me of that … of all this business. Well, good-bye. So you\u0027ll give that? …”\\n\\n Pierre left him, and went in to the old prince and Princess Marya.\\n\\n The old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Marya was the same as usual, but behind her sympathy for her brother, Pierre detected her relief that her brother\u0027s marriage was broken off. Looking at them, Pierre felt what a contempt and dislike they all had for the Rostovs; felt that it would be impossible in their presence even to mention the name of the girl who could give up Prince Andrey for any one in the world.\\n\\n At dinner they talked of the coming war, of which there could now be no doubt in the near future. Prince Andrey talked incessantly, and argued first with his father, and then with Dessalle, the Swiss tutor. He seemed more eager than usual, with that eagerness of which Pierre knew so well the inner cause.\\n\\n 这一天，皮埃尔在俱乐部里吃中饭，他从四面听见众人谈论有人试图拐骗罗斯托娃这一事件，他执拗地驳斥这些闲话，并叫大家相信，这充其量只是他的内兄向罗斯托娃求婚，遭到了拒绝。皮埃尔仿佛觉得，他有责任隐瞒事实真相，并且恢复罗斯托娃的名誉。\\n\\n 他心惊胆战地等待安德烈公爵回来，并且每天到老公爵那里去打听一下他的情况。\\n\\n 尼古拉·安德烈伊奇公爵从布里安小姐处获悉在满城传播的流言飞语，并且读了她写给公爵小姐玛丽亚的便函，在便函中娜塔莎拒绝了她的未婚夫。他看来似乎比平常更愉快，并且迫不及待地等候儿子。\\n\\n 阿纳托利走后过了几天皮埃尔接到一封安德烈公爵写来的便函，在便函中告知皮埃尔说他回来了，并请他便中去看他。\\n\\n 安德烈公爵已经到达莫斯科，他刚刚走进家门，就从他父亲那里接到一封娜塔莎写给公爵小姐玛丽亚的便函，在便函中她要拒绝她的未婚夫（布里安小姐从公爵小姐玛丽亚那里抢到这封便函，并且把它转交公爵），安德烈公爵还听见父亲添枝加叶地叙述有关拐骗娜塔莎的事件。\\n\\n 头一天晚上，安德烈公爵到家了。第二天早晨皮埃尔来看他。皮埃尔预料安德烈公爵几乎也处于娜塔莎同样的境地，因此在他走进客厅、听见书斋中传出安德烈公爵响亮的嗓音、兴奋地谈论某件关于彼得堡的阴谋事件时，他觉得非常惊异。老公爵和另一个什么人的语声有时打断他的话。公爵小姐玛丽娅向皮埃尔迎面走来。她叹了一口气，用目光指示安德烈公爵的房门，显然她对他的忧愁想表示同情，但是皮埃尔从公爵小姐玛丽亚的脸色看出，她对发生的事情感到高兴，并对她哥哥获悉未婚妻变节后的反应也感到高兴。\\n\\n “他说，这一层他预料到了，”她说，“我知道他的骄傲使他没法表露自己的感情，但是他在忍受心灵的痛苦方面，比我所预料的表现得更好，而且好得多。可见，非这样不可……”\\n\\n “难道这一切都完结了吗？”皮埃尔说。\\n\\n 公爵小姐玛丽亚惊异地望望他。她甚至不明白，怎么可以询问这种事。皮埃尔走进书斋。安德烈公爵完全变了，显然变得更加强壮，但是在他的眉毛之间又增添了一条横横的皱纹，他穿着一身便服，站在父亲和梅谢尔斯基公爵对面，做出有力的手势，热烈地争论。\\n\\n 谈话涉及斯佩兰斯基，他忽然被判处流刑以及有人捏造事实指控他叛国的消息甫才传到莫斯科了。\\n\\n “那些在一个月以前钦佩他的人如今都在审讯和指控他（斯佩兰斯基），”安德烈公爵说，“而且那班人没法明了他的意向。审讯一个失宠的人极为容易，别人都归咎于他；所以我要说，如果在目前的君主统治时期建树了什么佳债，那末，这一切佳绩都是他——他一人所建树的……”他看见皮埃尔后便停下来。他的面孔颤动了一下，立刻流露出凶恶的表情。\\n\\n “惟有后代才会赐予他以正义。”他说完这句话，旋即把脸转向皮埃尔。\\n\\n “你很好啊！越来越胖了，”他兴奋地说，但是他的额头上又露出一条更深的皱纹。“是啊！我很健康，”他在回答皮埃尔的问话时冷冷一笑。皮埃尔十分清楚，他的冷笑似乎在说：“很健康，可是我的健康谁也不稀罕。”安德烈公爵三言两语地跟皮埃尔谈到波兰边境后面的一条非常糟糕的道路，他在瑞士遇见几个认识皮埃尔的人，还谈到他从国外带来一个给儿子当教师的德萨尔先生，然后他在两个老头继续谈论斯佩兰斯基时又激昂陈词。\\n\\n “既然他叛国，他与拿破仑秘密勾结已有明证，那么就要公诸于众，“他急躁而且匆忙地说。“我本人过去和现在都不喜欢斯佩兰斯基，不过我喜欢维护正义。”此时皮埃尔从他朋友身上发觉一种他甚为熟悉的强烈愿望——使他自己心潮澎湃、争论和他自己毫无关系的事情，其目的在于压抑过分沉重的心情。\\n\\n 梅谢尔斯基公爵走后，安德烈公爵挽着皮埃尔的手臂，请他到给公爵准备的房间里去。在这个房间里可以看见一张铺好的床和几只打开的手提包和箱笼。安德烈公爵走到一只箱子前面，取出一只小匣子。他从小匣子里拿出一扎用纸包着的东西。他默不作声，动作迅速地做完这件事。之后他欠起身子，咳嗽几声清清嗓子。他的面孔阴郁，闭紧嘴唇。\\n\\n “如果我麻烦你，请原谅我……”皮埃尔明了，安德烈公爵想谈论娜塔莎，他那宽阔的脸上流露着同情和惋惜的神态。皮埃尔的面部表情激怒了安德烈公爵，他坚决地、不高兴地大声说下去：“我遭受到伯爵小姐罗斯托娃的拒绝，此外我还听到你的内兄向她求婚以及诸如此类的流言。是不是真有其事？”\\n\\n “是真又是假。”皮埃尔开口说，但是安德烈公爵打断他的话。\\n\\n “这儿是她的信件和相片，”他说。他从桌上拿起一包东西，递给皮埃尔。\\n\\n “如果你看见伯爵小姐，就把这样东西转交给她……”\\n\\n “她病得很厉害。”皮埃尔说。\\n\\n “这样说，她还在这儿？”安德烈公爵说。“库拉金公爵呢？”\\n\\n 他连忙问道。\\n\\n “他早就走了。她快要死了……”\\n\\n “她生病，我深表遗憾，”安德烈公爵说。他像父亲那样无情地、凶很地、不高兴地冷冷一笑。\\n\\n “这么说，库拉金先生没有赐予伯爵小姐罗斯托娃求婚的殊荣？”安德烈公爵说。他用鼻子呼哧呼哧地嗤了几声。\\n\\n “他不能结婚，因为地结过婚了，”皮埃尔说。\\n\\n 安德烈公爵又像他父亲那样不高兴地大声笑起来。\\n\\n “目前您的内兄在哪里，我可以打听一下吗？”他说。\\n\\n “他到彼得堡去了……其实我并不晓得。”皮埃尔说。\\n\\n “不过，这横竖一样，”安德烈公爵说，“你转告伯爵小姐罗斯托娃，她过去和现在都完全自由，我祝她诸事顺遂。”\\n\\n 皮埃尔拿起一札信件。安德烈公爵仿佛在想，他是否需要再对他说句什么话，或者等待皮埃尔有没有什么话要说，于是他把目光盯住皮埃尔。\\n\\n “您听我说，您还记得我们在彼得堡时的那次争论吧，”皮埃尔说，“您还记得有关……？”\\n\\n “我记得，”安德烈公爵连忙回答，“我说过要原谅淫荡的女人，但是我没有说过我能原谅她。我不能。”\\n\\n “难道可以相提并论吗？……”皮埃尔说。\\n\\n 安德烈公爵打断他的话。他用刺耳的嗓音叫嚷起来：\\n\\n “是啊，又要向她求婚，做个宽宏大量的人，如此等等？……是的，这倒很高尚，但是我不擅长sur　brisées　de　monsieur①。如果你愿意做我的朋友，就永远不要和我谈这个……谈这一切。喂，再见。那末你转交给她，行吗？……”\\n\\n 皮埃尔从房里走出去，到老公爵和公爵小姐玛丽亚那里去了。 \\n\\n ①法语：步这个先生的后尘。\\n\\n 午宴之间的谈话涉及战争，战争的临近逐渐地变得无可争议了。安德烈公爵滔滔不绝地谈话，时而和父亲争论，时而和瑞士籍教师德萨尔争论，看来他比平常为振奋，皮埃尔十分清楚地知道他所以精神振奋的原因。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3460.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
