{"id":41081,"no":106,"title":"Book 6 Chapter 4","content":"PRINCE ANDREY arrived in Petersburg in the August of 1809. It was the period when the young Speransky was at the zenith of his fame and his reforms were being carried out with the utmost vigour. In that very month the Tsar was thrown out of his carriage, hurt his foot, and was laid up for three weeks at Peterhof, seeing Speransky every day and no one else. At that period there were in preparation the two famous decrees that so convulsed society, abolishing the bestowal of grades by court favour and establishing examinations for obtaining the ranks of collegiate assessors and state councillors. But besides these reforms, a whole political constitution was under discussion destined to transform the whole legal, administrative and financial system of government from the Privy Council to the district tribunals. At this time the vague, liberal ideals with which the Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne were taking shape and being carried into practice. Those ideals he had striven to realise with the aid of Tchartorizhsky, Novosiltsov, Kotchubey, and Stroganov, whom he used himself to call in fun his “comité du salut publique.” Now all were replaced by Speransky on the civil side and Araktcheev on the military.\n Soon after his arrival, Prince Andrey, as a kammerherr, presented himself at court and at a levée. The Tsar, meeting him on two occasions, did not deign to bestow a single word upon him. Prince Andrey had fancied even before then that he was antipathetic to the Tsar; that the Tsar disliked his face and his whole personality. In the cold, repellent glance with which the Tsar looked at him, Prince Andrey found further confirmation of this supposition. Courtiers explained the Tsar\u0027s slight to Prince Andrey by saying that his majesty was displeased at Bolkonsky\u0027s having retired from active service since 1805.\n “I know myself that one has no control over one\u0027s likes and dislikes,” thought Prince Andrey, “and so it is of no use to think of presenting my note on army reform in person to the Tsar, but the thing will speak for itself.” He sent word about his note to an old field-marshal, a friend of his father\u0027s. The field-marshal fixed an hour to see him, received him cordially, and promised to lay it before the Tsar. A few days later, Prince Andrey received notice that he was to call upon the minister of war, Count Araktcheev.\n At nine o\u0027clock in the morning on the day appointed, Prince Andrey entered Count Araktcheev\u0027s reception-room.\n Prince Andrey did not know Araktcheev personally and had never seen him, but all that he knew about him had inspired him with little respect for the man.\n “He is the minister of war, a person the Tsar trusts, and no one need have any concern with his personal qualities; he has been commissioned to look at my note, consequently he is the only person who can get it adopted,” thought Prince Andrey, as he waited among many persons of importance and unimportance in Count Araktcheev\u0027s anteroom.\n During the years of his service—for the most part as an adjutant—Prince Andrey had seen the anterooms of many great personages, and the various characteristic types of such anterooms were very readily recognised by him. Count Araktcheev\u0027s anteroom had quite a special character. The faces of the persons of no consequence who were awaiting their turns for an audience with Count Araktcheev betrayed a feeling of humiliation and servility; the faces of those of superior rank all wore an expression of general discomfort, concealed under a mask of ease and ridicule, of themselves and their position and the person they were waiting to see. Some of them walked up and down plunged in thought; others were laughing and whispering together, and Prince Andrey caught the nickname Sila Andreitch (Sila meaning Force or Violence), and the words “the governor\u0027ll give it you,” referring to Count Araktcheev. One general (a person of great consequence), unmistakably chagrined at being kept waiting so long, sat with crossed legs, disdainfully smiling to himself.\n But as soon as the door opened, all faces instantly betrayed one feeling only—terror.\n Prince Andrey asked the adjutant on duty to mention his name again, but he received a sarcastic stare, and was told his turn would come in due course. After several persons had been let in and let out of the minister\u0027s room by the adjutant, an officer was admitted at the dreadful door, whose abject and panic-stricken face had struck Prince Andrey. The officer\u0027s audience lasted a long while. Suddenly the roar of a harsh voice was heard through the door, and the officer, with a white face and trembling lips, came out, and clutching at his head, crossed the anteroom. After that, Prince Andrey was conducted to the door, and the adjutant in a whisper said: “To the right, at the window.”\n Prince Andrey went into a plain, neat study, and saw at the table a man of forty with a long waist, with a long, closely-cropped head, deep wrinkles, scowling brows over brown-green, dull eyes, and a red, over-hanging nose. Araktcheev turned his head towards him, without looking at him.\n “What is it you are petitioning for?” asked Araktcheev.\n “There is nothing that I am…petitioning for, your excellency,” Prince Andrey pronounced softly. Araktcheev\u0027s eyes turned to him.\n “Sit down,” said Araktcheev. “Prince Bolkonsky?”\n “I have no petition to make, but his majesty the Tsar has graciously sent to your excellency a note submitted by me—”\n “Be so good as to see, my dear sir; I have read your note,” Araktcheev interrupted, uttering only the first words civilly, again looking away from him, and relapsing more and more into a tone of grumbling contempt. “Is it new army regulations you propose? There are regulations in plenty; no one will carry out the old ones. Nowadays every one\u0027s drawing up regulations; it\u0027s easier writing than doing.”\n “I have come by the desire of his majesty the Tsar to learn from your excellency how you propose to deal with my project,” said Prince Andrey courteously.\n “I have proposed a resolution in regard to your note, and have forwarded it to the committee. I do not approve,” said Araktcheev, getting up and taking a paper out of the writing-table. “Here.” He gave it to Prince Andrey. Right across the note had been scrawled, without punctuation or capital letters and with words misspelt: “Superficially compiled seeing that it\u0027s drawn up in imitation of the French army regulations and needlessly departing from the standing orders.”\n “To what committee has the note been referred?” asked Prince Andrey.\n “To the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have proposed your honour being enrolled among its members. Only without salary.”\n Prince Andrey smiled.\n “I am not seeking a salary.”\n “A member without salary,” repeated Araktcheev. “I wish you good day. Hey! call! who\u0027s the next?” he shouted, as he bowed to Prince Andrey.\n ①斯佩兰斯基（1772～1839），俄国改良派政治活动家，欲使俄国农奴制度迎合资本主义发展的需要，在封建贵族高压之下，他无法施展个人的才略，备受奚落，遂于一八一二年被逐。\n ②法语：社会救济委员会。\n “我本人知道，人人都会对别人产生好感，或者产生反感，不过我们无可奈何，”安德烈公爵想道，“因此用不着想到关于亲自向国王送交军事条令呈文的事情，但事情本身是会说明问题的。”他把有关他的呈文的内容转告父亲的友人——老元帅。元帅约定了一个时间，亲切地接见他，并且答应把这件事禀告国王。过了几天有人告知安德烈公爵：他应当去见军政大臣阿拉克切耶夫伯爵。\n 在约定的那天，上午九点钟，安德烈公爵来到接待室求见阿拉克切耶夫伯爵。\n 安德烈公爵本人不认识阿拉克切耶夫，从来没有见过他，但是他知道的有关他的一切情形，不太会引起他对这个人的尊敬。\n “他是军政大臣，皇帝陛下的代理人，谁也不应该去管他个人的品质，他接受委托来审理我的呈文，因此只有他一人才能把它送去办理。”安德烈公爵想道，在接待室介乎许多显要的、非显要的官员之间等候阿拉克切耶夫伯爵。\n 安德烈公爵在他担任职务、多半是担任副官职务期间，看见过许多显要官员的接待室，因此这些接待室的各种不同的特征，他一清二楚，了若指掌。阿拉克切耶夫伯爵的接待室是十分特殊的。在阿拉克切耶夫伯爵接待室里，在依次等待接见的非显要官员的脸上，可以看到一种羞愧和恭顺的表情，在较为显要的官员的脸上，可以普遍地看出困窘不安的表情，官员的假像遮盖了不安的表情，他们假装出毫无拘束的样子，假装出嘲笑自己，嘲笑自己的地位，也嘲笑他们所等待的官员。有的人若有所思地踱来踱去，有的人窃窃私语，嘻皮笑脸，安德烈公爵听见那针对阿拉克切耶夫伯爵喊出的“西拉（意指权势）·安德烈伊奇”这个绰号（sobriquet①）和针对他说的“大叔给你点厉害瞧”这句话。有一个将军（显要人物）很明显是因为等候得太久而感到十分委屈，他坐在那里，交替地架起二郎腿，暗自轻蔑地微笑。 \n ①法语：绰号。\n 紧接着，安德烈公爵被领到门口，值班人员轻声地说：\n “右边，向那个窗口走去吧。”\n 安德烈公爵走进一间陈设简单而整洁的办公室，他在桌旁看见一个四十岁的人，长长的腰身，长长的脑袋，头发剪得短短的，脸上的皱纹很深，紧皱的双眉下面露出绿褐色的眼睛，红红的鼻子半悬垂着。阿拉克切耶夫向他转过头来，眼睛却没有看着他。\n “您有何请求？”阿拉克切耶夫问道。\n “大人，我什么都不……请求。”安德烈公爵低声地说。阿拉克切耶夫向他转过脸来。\n “请坐，”阿拉克切耶夫说，“博尔孔斯基公爵。”\n “我什么也不请求，皇帝陛下叫我把递上的呈文转送给大人……”\n “我亲爱的，请注意，我看过您的禀奏了，”阿拉克切耶夫打断他的话，只是头几句话倒说得亲切，他这次又不看他的面孔了，腔调儿显得越来越不满而且轻蔑，“您提出新的军事条令吗？法令多得很，无人可来执行旧法令。目前都在写法令，写比做更为容易。”\n “我遵照陛下的旨意前来向大人打听，您打算怎样处理递上的呈文？”安德烈公爵毕恭毕敬地说。\n “我对您的禀奏作出了批示并转送委员会。我不赞成，”阿拉克切耶夫站立起来，从写字台上拿起一份公文时说道，“瞧。”他把公文递给安德烈公爵。\n 公文纸上用铅笔横着写了一行字，没有大写字母，没有拼写错误，也没有标点符号：“毫无理由抄袭法国军事条令，毋需放弃军法条例。”\n “呈文究竟转交给什么委员会？”安德烈公爵问道。\n “转交给军事条令委员会，我推荐阁下担任委员。只是没有薪金。”\n 安德烈公爵微微一笑。\n “我没有这种愿望。”\n “没有薪金当委员，”阿拉克切耶夫重复地说。“我与阁下结识，深感荣幸。喂！请把名字说声来！还有什么人？”他向安德烈公爵鞠躬行礼时大声喊道。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3404.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
