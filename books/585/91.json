{"id":41066,"no":91,"title":"Book 5 Chapter 10","content":"SHORTLY after his reception into the brotherhood of the freemasons, Pierre set off to the Kiev province, where were the greater number of his peasants, with full instructions written for his guidance in doing his duty on his estates.\\n\\n On reaching Kiev, Pierre sent for all his stewards to his head counting-house, and explained to them his intentions and his desires. He told them that steps would very shortly be taken for the complete liberation of his peasants from serfdom, that till that time his peasants were not to be overburdened with labour, that the women with children were not to be sent out to work, that assistance was to be given to the peasants, that wrong-doing was to be met with admonishment, and not with corporal punishment; and that on every estate there must be founded hospitals, almshouses, and schools. Several of the stewards (among them were some bailiffs barely able to read and write) listened in dismay, supposing the upshot of the young count\u0027s remarks to be that he was dissatisfied with their management and embezzlement of his money. Others, after the first shock of alarm, derived amusement from Pierre\u0027s lisp and the new words he used that they had not heard before. Others again found a simple satisfaction in hearing the sound of their master\u0027s voice. But some, among them the head steward, divined from this speech how to deal with their master for the attainment of their own ends.\\n\\n The head steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre\u0027s projects; but observed that, apart from these innovations, matters were in a bad way and needed thoroughly going into.\\n\\n In spite of Count Bezuhov\u0027s enormous wealth, Pierre ever since he had inherited it, and had been, as people said, in receipt of an annual income of five hundred thousand, had felt much less rich than when he had been receiving an allowance of ten thousand from his father. In general outlines he was vaguely aware of the following budget. About eighty thousand was being paid into the Land Bank as interest on mortgages on his estates. About thirty thousand went to the maintenance of his estate in the suburbs of Moscow, his Moscow house, and his cousins the princesses. About fifteen thousand were given in pensions, and as much more to benevolent institutions. One hundred and fifty thousand were sent to his countess, for her maintenance. Some seventy thousand were paid away as interest on debts. The building of a new church had for the last two years been costing about ten thousand. The remainder—some one hundred thousand—was spent—he hardly knew how—and almost every year he was forced to borrow. Moreover every year the head steward wrote to him of conflagrations, or failures of crops, or of the necessity of rebuilding factories or workshops. And so the first duty with which Pierre was confronted was the one for which he had the least capacity and inclination—attention to practical business.\\n\\n Every day Pierre went into things with the head steward. But he felt that what he was doing did not advance matters one inch. He felt that all he did was quite apart from the reality, that his efforts had no grip on the business, and would not set it in progress. On one side the head steward put matters in their worst light, proving to Pierre the necessity of paying his debts, and entering upon new undertakings with the labour of his serf peasants, to which Pierre would not agree. On the other side, Pierre urged their entering upon the work of liberation, to which the head steward objected the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank, and the consequent impossibility of haste in the matter. The head steward did not say that this was utterly impossible; he proposed as the means for attaining this object, the sale of the forests in the Kostroma province, the sale of the lands on the lower Volga, and of the Crimean estate. But all these operations were connected in the head steward\u0027s talk with such a complexity of processes, the removal of certain prohibitory clauses, the obtaining of certain permissions, and so on, that Pierre lost the thread, and could only say: “Yes, yes, do so then.”\\n\\n Pierre had none of that practical tenacity, which would have made it possible for him to undertake the business himself, and so he did not like it, and only tried to keep up a pretence of going into business before the head steward. The steward too kept up a pretence before the count of regarding his participation in it as of great use to his master, and a great inconvenience to himself.\\n\\n In Kiev he had acquaintances: persons not acquaintances made haste to become so, and gave a warm welcome to the young man of fortune, the largest landowner of the province, who had come into their midst. The temptations on the side of Pierre\u0027s besetting weakness, the one to which he had given the first place at his initiation into the lodge, were so strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days, weeks, and months of his life were busily filled up with parties, dinners, breakfasts, and balls, giving him as little time to think as at Petersburg. Instead of the new life Pierre had hoped to lead, he was living just the same old life only in different surroundings.\\n\\n Of the three precepts of freemasonry, Pierre had to admit that he had not fulfilled that one which prescribes for every mason the duty of being a model of moral life; and of the seven virtues he was entirely without two—morality and love of death. He comforted himself by reflecting that, on the other hand, he was fulfilling the other precept—the improvement of the human race; and had other virtues, love for his neighbour and liberality.\\n\\n In the spring of 1807, Pierre made up his mind to go back again to Petersburg. On the way back he intended to make the tour of all his estates, and to ascertain personally what had been done of what had been prescribed by him, and in what position the people now were who had been entrusted to him by God, and whom he had been striving to benefit.\\n\\n The head steward, who regarded all the young count\u0027s freaks as almost insanity—disastrous to him, to himself, and to his peasants—made concessions to his weaknesses. While continuing to represent the liberation of his serfs as impracticable, he made arrangements on all his estates for the building of schools, hospitals, and asylums on a large scale to be begun ready for the master\u0027s visit, prepared everywhere for him to be met, not with ceremonious processions, which he knew would not be to Pierre\u0027s taste, but with just the devotionally grateful welcomes, with holy images and bread and salt, such as would, according to his understanding of the count, impress him and delude him.\\n\\n The southern spring, the easy, rapid journey in his Vienna carriage and the solitude of the road, had a gladdening influence on Pierre. The estates, which he had not before visited, were one more picturesque than the other; the peasantry seemed everywhere thriving, and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere he was met by welcomes, which though they embarrassed Pierre, yet at the bottom of his heart rejoiced him. At one place the peasants had brought him bread and salt and the images of Peter and Paul, and begged permission in honour of his patron saints, Peter and Paul, and in token of love and gratitude for the benefits conferred on them, to erect at their own expense a new chapel in the church. At another place he was welcomed by women with babies in their arms, who came to thank him for being released from the obligation of heavy labour. In a third place he was met by a priest with a cross, surrounded by children, whom by the favour of the count he was instructing in reading and writing and religion. On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes stone buildings erected, or in course of erection, all on one plan, hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were in short time to be opened. Everywhere Pierre saw the steward\u0027s reckoning of service due to him diminished in comparison with the past, and heard touching thanks for what was remitted from deputations of peasants in blue, full-skirted coats.\\n\\n But Pierre did not know that where they brought him bread and salt and were building a chapel of Peter and Paul there was a trading village, and a fair on St. Peter\u0027s day, that the chapel had been built long ago by wealthy peasants of the village, and that nine-tenths of the peasants of that village were in the utmost destitution. He did not know that since by his orders nursing mothers were not sent to work on their master\u0027s land, those same mothers did even harder work on their own bit of land. He did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants with his exactions, and that the pupils gathered around him were yielded up to him with tears and redeemed for large sums by their parents. He did not know that the stone buildings were being raised by his labourers, and increased the forced labour of his peasants, which was only less upon paper. He did not know that where the steward pointed out to him in the account book the reduction of rent to one-third in accordance with his will, the labour exacted had been raised by one half. And so Pierre was enchanted by his journey over his estates, and came back completely to the philanthropic frame of mind in which he had left Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his preceptor and brother, as he called the grand master.\\n\\n “How easy it is, how little effort is needed to do so much good,” thought Pierre, “and how little we trouble ourselves to do it!”\\n\\n He was happy at the gratitude shown him, but abashed at receiving it. That gratitude reminded him how much more he could do for those simple, good-hearted people.\\n\\n The head steward, a very stupid and crafty man, who thoroughly understood the clever and na?ve count, and played with him like a toy, seeing the effect produced on Pierre by these carefully arranged receptions, was bolder in advancing arguments to prove the impossibility, and even more, the uselessness of liberating the peasants, who were so perfectly happy without that.\\n\\n In the recesses of his own heart, Pierre agreed with the steward that it was difficult to imagine people happier, and that there was no knowing what their future would be in freedom. But though reluctantly, he stuck to what he thought the right thing. The steward promised to use every effort to carry out the count\u0027s wishes, perceiving clearly that the count would never be in a position to verify whether every measure had been taken for the sale of the forests and estates for the repayment of loans from the bank, would never probably even inquire, and would certainly never find out that the buildings, when finished, stood empty, and that the peasants were giving in labour and money just what they gave with other masters, that is, all that could be got out of them.\\n\\n 到达基辅后，皮埃尔便在总办事处召集全体管事人，向他们说明他的意图和愿望。他对他们说，应该即将采取措施，以彻底解放农民，使其摆脱农奴制的依赖关系，届时不应加重农民的劳动负担，不宜将妇女、儿童送去从事劳动，务宜给予农民以帮助，处罚应用以规劝，而不应采用肉刑，于各个领地设立医院、孤儿院、养老院和学校。一些管事人（这里头包括识字不多的管家）吃惊地听他说话，揣测说话的涵义在于，年轻的伯爵对他们管事和隐藏金钱表示不满，另一些管事人感受到初悸之后，认为皮埃尔把“C”、“C”音发得有点像“D”、“E”音、认为那些他们未尝听到的新名词都是挺有趣的，第三种管事人认为听听老爷讲话简直是一件乐事，第四种管事人都是聪明人，其中包括总管事人，他们从这次讲话中明白了，要如何对待老爷，藉以达到自己的目的。\\n\\n 总管事对皮埃尔的意向深表同情，但他注意到，除开这些改革而外，还必须认真从事那些一团糟的业务研究。\\n\\n 别祖霍夫伯爵获得了巨大的财富，据云每年均有五十万卢布的收入，但较诸以前他从已故的老伯爵手上获得一万卢布的时候，反而觉得很不富裕。他模糊地意识到他有如下一笔大致的预算。各领地要向管理局缴纳八万卢布；莫斯科近郊、莫斯科市内的住宅的消费和几位公爵小姐的生活费用约占三万卢布；支付养老金和拨给慈善机关的款项各占一万五千卢布左右；拨给伯爵夫人的生活费占十五万卢布；支付债务的利金约七万卢布；这两年用在业已着手兴建的教堂上的款子约一万卢布；其余十万卢布连他自己也不晓得是怎样开销的，因此他年年不得不借钱。除此而外，每年之内总管事人时而在信中禀告大灾，时而禀告歉收，时而禀告作坊、工厂改进的必要。因此皮埃尔觉得，头一件大事，是他最缺乏志趣和能力去应付的事情——·研·究·业·务。\\n\\n 皮埃尔和总管事人每天都要研究业务。但是他感到，他的研究不能把业务向前推进一步。他也感觉到，他的研究并不以业务为转移，他们没有抓紧业务，没有使它向前推进。一方面，总管事人把业务看得很糟，并向皮埃尔表明，务必要偿清债务，凭藉农奴的劳力从事新活动，皮埃尔却不同意；另一面，皮埃尔要求着手解放农奴，管事人却向他表明，首先要向管理局偿还债务，因此不能从速执行解放农奴的使命。\\n\\n 管事人不说解放农奴是完全不可能的，为了达到此一目的，他建议出售科斯特罗马省的森林，出售洼地和克里木的领地。但是管事人说，这些交易上的手续非常复杂，不仅要撤消禁令，而且要申请，听候批准，等等，以致皮埃尔惘然若失，只有对他说，“是的，是的，您就这么办。”\\n\\n 皮埃尔缺乏那种认真办事的百折不回的实干能力，所以他不喜欢业务，而只是在管事人面前极力装出一副忙着办事的样子。管事人在伯爵面前也竭力装出好像办理这些业务对主人极为有利，而对他自己却是件为难的事。\\n\\n 一些熟人在大城市里碰头了，不认识的人也忙着和他交朋友，热情地欢迎新到的富翁，本省最大的地主。皮埃尔在加入共济会分会时坦白承认他有易受引诱这个主要弱点，而今诱惑力是那样强烈，以致他无力控制住自己。皮埃尔的生涯又如在彼得堡一般，整天整天地、整周整周地、整月整月地在晚会、舞会、早饭和午宴当中度过，好不忙碌，好不心焦，哪里有时间让他醒悟过来。皮埃尔只是在另一种环境中过着从前那样的生活，而不是他希望过的新生活。\\n\\n 共济会的三大宗旨中，皮埃尔意识到，他没有去履行每个共济会员根据规定必须成为精神生活楷模的使命。七条美德中，他本身缺少两条：品行端正、爱献身。他可以安慰自己的是，他履行了另一项使命：改造人类，并且具备有另外两条美德：爱他人，特别是慷慨。\\n\\n 一八○七年春季，皮埃尔决定回到彼得堡。在归途中，他想访遍他的领地，并使他自己确信，按照规定完成了什么使命，检查一下他受托于上帝并力图施以恩泽的良民现在处于何种境地。\\n\\n 总管事人认为年轻的伯爵的各种意图几乎是丧失理智的表现，对自己，对他，对农民都是不利的，但是他还是作出了让步。他仍旧认为解放农奴是办不到的事，他于是吩咐在各领地修建学校、医院、孤儿院、养老院的高大房屋；在各处做好欢迎老爷的准备，他知道皮埃尔不喜欢大肆铺张的隆重仪式，但是照他对老爷的了解，正如献神像、献面包和盐等宗教感恩之类的仪式却能影响伯爵，把他哄骗一阵子。\\n\\n 南方的春天，乘坐维也纳式四轮马车平静的飞奔、旅途的独处，在在都使皮埃尔感到心旷神怡。那些他未曾驻足的领地富有画意，一个比一个优美；他似乎觉得到处的平民都很幸福，对他的恩惠深表谢忱。到处都举行欢迎仪式，虽使皮埃尔觉得不好意思，但是在他的灵魂深处引起一种快感。有个地方的农民向他献出面包、食盐和彼得与保罗圣像，请求他允许他们自筹经费在教堂营建新侧祭坛，藉以纪念他的彼得天使和保罗天使，爱戴皮埃尔并对他的恩典表示感激。在另一领地，携带婴孩的妇女门都来迎接他，因为他使她们摆脱沉重的劳动而向他表示感谢。在第三领地，迎接他的是儿童簇拥的手捧十字架的神甫，他承蒙伯爵宠信，教儿童识字、信奉宗教。在各个领地皮埃尔亲眼看见那些按照一个计划正在兴建和业已兴建的医院、学校、养老院的砖石结构的楼房，它们即将交付使用。皮埃尔处处看到管事人关于减少劳役的报告书，并且听到那些身穿蓝色长衫的农民代表为此而道出的深深感激的话语。\\n\\n 皮埃尔只是不知道，那个向他献面包和盐并且兴建彼得与保罗侧祭坛的地方，是一个商业村镇、每逢圣彼得节开集的市场，这个村镇的富裕农民都去见他，他们老早就在兴建侧祭坛了，而占村镇十分之九的农民却沦为赤贫。他不知道，遵照他的命令已不再把·哺·乳妇女——随带婴孩的妇女送去服劳役，这些哺乳妇女于是在自己屋里承担极其艰苦的家务劳动。他不知道，那个拿着十字架来迎接他的神甫向农民征收苛捐杂税，加重农民的负担，他所招收的学生都是由家长含着泪水把他们送到他跟前，又花掉一大笔钱赎回来的。他不晓得，砖石结构的房屋是由农民自己的劳工按照计划兴建的，因而加重了农民的劳役，减轻劳役只是一纸空文。他不知道，管事人凭本子向他表明，依照他的意志租金已减少三分之一，同时本地的赋役却增加了一半。因此皮埃尔对游历领地一事感到十分满意，完全恢复了他离开彼得堡时那种慈善事业家的心情，于是给他称为会长的师兄写了一封热情洋溢的信。\\n\\n “多么轻易，不太费劲，就做成了这么多善事，”皮埃尔想道，“我们对这种事关心得多么不够啊　”\\n\\n 别人对他表示感谢使他觉得非常幸福，但在接受感谢时，他又觉得汗颜。这种感谢使他想到，他最好能够替这些平凡而善良的人做更多的事。\\n\\n 总管事人是一个极为愚庸而且滑头的人，他完全了解这个既聪颖而又幼稚的伯爵，他就像耍着玩具似的玩弄他，他看到事前筹备的招待对皮埃尔产生了影响，便更加坚决地向他提出种种理由，说什么解放农奴是办不成的，主要是不必要的，因为农奴不解放原来就非常幸福。\\n\\n 皮埃尔在隐秘的内心也同意总管事人的看法，认为难以想象出有比农奴更幸福的人，天晓得什么前程等待着获得自由的农奴，虽然皮埃尔不是有此心愿，但仍然坚持他认为合乎正义的事情。管事人答应使用一切实力去履行伯爵的意志，而且十分明白，伯爵不仅永远无法检查他是否采取措施售出森林和领地，是否已还清管理局的债务，而且十之八九永远不会询问和打听业已兴建的房舍怎么空着不交付使用，农民怎么还像别的农奴一样继续以劳役和金钱的形式交出他们所能提供的一切。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3389.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
