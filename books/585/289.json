{"id":41264,"no":289,"title":"Book 13 Chapter 15","content":"EARLY in October another messenger came to Kutuzov from Napoleon with overtures for peace and a letter, falsely professing to come from Moscow, though Napoleon was in fact not far ahead of Kutuzov on the old Kaluga road. Kutuzov answered this letter as he had done the first one, brought him by Lauriston; he said that there could be no question of peace.\\n\\n Soon after this Dorohov\u0027s irregulars, which were moving on the left of Tarutino, sent a report that French troops had appeared at Fominskoe, that these troops were of Broussier\u0027s division, and that that division, being separate from the rest of the army, might easily be cut to pieces. The soldiers and officers again clamoured for action. The staff generals, elated by the easy victory of Tarutino, urged on Kutuzov that Dorohov\u0027s suggestion should be acted upon.\\n\\n Kutuzov did not consider any action necessary. A middle course, as was inevitable, was adopted; a small detachment was sent to Fominskoe to attack Broussier.\\n\\n By strange chance this appointment, a most difficult and most important one, as it turned out to be later, was given to Dohturov, that modest little general, whom no one has depicted to us making plans of campaign, dashing at the head of regiments, dropping crosses about batteries, or doing anything of the kind; whom people looked on and spoke of as lacking decision and penetration, though all through the Russian wars with the French, from Austerlitz to the year 1813, we always find him in command where the position is particularly difficult. At Austerlitz he was the last to remain at the ford of Augest, rallying the regiments, saving what he could, when all was flight and ruin, and not a single other general was to be found in the rearguard. When ill with fever, he marched with twenty thousand men to Smolensk to defend the town against the whole of Napoleon\u0027s army. In Smolensk he had only just fallen asleep at the Malahovsky gates in a paroxysm of fever when he was waked by the cannonade of Smolensk, and Smolensk held out a whole day. At Borodino when Bagration was killed, and nine-tenths of the men of our left flank had been slain, and the fire of all the French artillery was turned upon it, Kutuzov made haste to recall another general he had sent by mistake, and sent there no other than Dohturov, who was said to be lacking in decision and penetration. And unpretentious little Dohturov went there, and Borodino became the greatest glory of the Russian arms. And many of its heroes have been celebrated in prose and verse, but of Dohturov hardly a word. Again Dohturov was sent to Fominskoe, and from there to Maley Yaroslavets, the place where the last battle was fought with the French, and where it is plain the final destruction of the French army really begun. And again many heroes and men of genius are described to us in accounts of this period of the campaign, but of Dohturov nothing is said, or but few words of dubious praise. This silence in regard to Dohturov is the plainest testimony to his merits.\\n\\n It is natural that a man who does not understand the working of a machine should suppose, when he sees it in action, that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance, and flaps about in it, hindering its progress, is the most important part of the mechanism. Any one who does not understand the construction of the machine cannot conceive that this shaving is only clogging and spoiling it, while the little cog-wheel, which turns noiselessly, is one of the most essential parts of the machine.\\n\\n On the 10th of October Dohturov had marched halfway to Fominskoe, and halted at the village of Aristovo, making every preparation for exactly carrying out the orders given him. On the same day the whole French army, after reaching in its spasmodic rush as far as Murat\u0027s position, seemingly with the object of giving battle, suddenly, with no apparent cause, turned off to the left to the new Kaluga road, and began marching into Fominskoe, where Broussier had before been alone. Dohturov had under his command at the time only Dorohov\u0027s troops and the two small detachments of Figner and Seslavin.\\n\\n On the evening of the 11th of October, Seslavin came to the general at Aristovo with a French prisoner of the guards. The prisoner said that the troops that had reached Fominskoe that day were the advance guard of the whole army; that Napoleon was with them; that the whole army had marched out of Moscow five days before. The same evening a house-serf coming from Borovsk brought word that he had seen an immense army entering that town. Dorohov\u0027s Cossacks reported that they had seen the French guards marching along the road to Borovsk. From all this it was evident that where they had expected to find one division there was now the whole army of the French, marching from Moscow in an unexpected direction—along the old Kaluga road. Dohturov was unwilling to take any action, as it was not clear to him now where his duty lay. He had received instructions to attack Fominskoe. But there had then been only Broussier at Fominskoe, and now the whole French army was there. Yermolov wanted to act on his own judgment, but Dohturov insisted that he must have instructions from his highness the commander-in-chief. It was resolved to send a report to the staff.\\n\\n For this purpose they chose a capable officer, Bolhovitinov, who was to take a written report, and to explain the whole matter verbally. At midnight Bolhovitinov received his despatch and his verbal instructions, and galloped off to headquarters, accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.\\n\\n 在此之后不久，在塔鲁丁诺左侧一带活动的多洛霍夫的游击队送来一份报告，称在福明斯克出现布鲁西埃的一个师，这个师和其他部队失去了联系，很容易被歼灭。士兵们和军官们又要求行动了。参谋部的将军们被在塔鲁丁诺轻易获胜所鼓舞，坚决要求库图佐夫采纳多洛霍夫的建议。但库图佐夫则认为没有必要发动任何进攻，于是采取了折衷办法：做一件应该做的事，派一支不大的部队到福明斯克去袭击布鲁西埃。\\n\\n 由于奇异的巧合，多赫图罗夫接受了这一任务，后来表明这是一件最困难和最重要的任务。多赫图罗夫——就是那个谦虚、矮小的多赫图罗夫。没有任何一个人向我们描述过，他曾制定过作战计划、在团队前跑来跑去，给炮兵连发十字勋章，等等，大家都认为他优柔寡断，没有远见，但是，也就是这个多赫图罗夫，在整个俄法战争中——从奥斯特利茨到一九一三年的历次战争中，只要哪里战况艰难，就都有他在场指挥。在奥斯特利茨战役中，当所有的官兵死的死，逃的逃，后卫连一个将军也没有的时候，他把残部集结起来，拯救那可以拯救的一切，在奥格斯特大坝坚守到最后。他正染上疟疾，还率领两万人马奔赴斯摩棱斯克抗击拿破仑的车队，保卫了这座城市。在斯摩棱斯克，在莫洛霍夫斯基城门，他的疟疾病发作了，刚刚睡着，攻城的炮声惊醒了他，斯摩棱斯克城坚守了整整一天。在波罗底诺战役中，巴格拉季翁阵亡了，我军左翼部队损失了十分之九，法国炮兵全力向那儿进攻，派到那里去的不是别人，正是这个优柔寡断、缺少远见的多赫图罗夫，库图佐夫原来是派另外的人去的，后来他赶快纠正了这一错误。于是这个文静矮小的多赫图罗夫到那儿去了，波罗底诺成为俄国军队的最大光荣。在诗歌和散文中向我们描写了很多英雄，但却没有一句提到多赫图罗夫。\\n\\n 又是多赫图罗夫被派到福明斯克，从那里又到小雅罗斯维茨，在那里同法国人打了最后一仗，显然，法国人的灭亡也就是从这里开始的，在这一期间的若干战役中又向我们描绘了许多天才和英雄，但是，关于多赫图罗夫仍然是一句不提，或者是轻描淡写，或者是含糊其辞。对于多赫图罗夫这样避而不谈，反而更加证实了他的优点。\\n\\n 自然，一个不懂得机器运转原理的人，一看见偶然掉进去的木屑，妨碍了机器运转，老在里面打转，就会误认为，这是那台机器最主要部分。不懂机器构造原理的人不会理解，机器最主要部件不是把事情弄糟的木屑，而是那无声转动的小小的传动齿轮。\\n\\n 十月十日，多赫图罗夫前往福明斯克途中，抵达阿里斯托沃村，停止前进，准备正确执行上级命令的时候，就在这同一天，好像得了疯病一样，全部法国军队开到了缪拉的阵地，好像准备要打一仗，可是突然又无缘无故地向左转到新卡卢日斯卡雅大路，进驻原先只有布鲁西埃驻扎在那里的福明斯克。而此时属于多赫图罗夫指挥的，除了多洛霍夫游击队之外，还有菲格纳和谢斯拉温领导的两支小游击队。\\n\\n 十月十一日晚，谢斯拉温带一名他俘虏的法国近卫军士兵来到阿里斯托沃村来见司令官。俘虏说，当天进入福明斯克的军队是整个大军的前卫部队，拿破仑就在其中，全军离开莫斯科已经是第五天了。就在当天晚上，从博罗夫斯克来了一名杂役，他说，他看到了大批法国军队开进城里。多洛霍夫游击队的哥萨克也报告，他们看到了法国军队顺着大路开往博罗夫斯克。所有这些情报都明显地表明，原先只想到在那里只有一个师，而现在却是全部法国军队，他们从莫斯科出发之后，走的是一条出人意料之外的路线——旧卡卢日斯卡雅大路。多赫图罗夫不愿采取任何行动，因为他现在还不明确他的责任是什么。他接受的任务是袭击福明斯克。但是原先在福明斯克只有布鲁西埃一个师，而现在是全部法国军队。叶尔莫洛夫想要相机而行，但是多赫图罗夫坚持必须等待最高爵爷的命令。于是，决定派人去向总部报告。\\n\\n 为此，选派了一名精明强干的军官博尔霍维季诺夫，他除了呈递书面报告外，还要在口头上能把全部情况报告清楚。夜里十一点多钟，博尔霍维季诺夫接受了书面报告和口头指示，就带领一名哥萨克和几匹可以轮换骑的马，飞快驰往总司令部。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3587.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
