{"id":41006,"no":31,"title":"Book 2 Chapter 6","content":"KUTUZOV fell back to Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over the river Inn (in Braunau) and the river Traun (in Linz). On the 23rd of October the Russian troops crossed the river Enns. The Russian baggage-waggons and artillery and the columns of troops were in the middle of that day stretching in a long string across the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge. The day was warm, autumnal, and rainy. The wide view that opened out from the heights where the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times narrowed by the slanting rain that shut it in like a muslin curtain, then again widened out, and in the bright sunlight objects could be distinctly seen in the distance, looking as if covered with a coat of varnish. The little town could be seen below with its white houses and its red roofs, its cathedral and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed masses of Russian troops, crowded together. At the bend of the Danube could be seen ships and the island and a castle with a park, surrounded by the waters formed by the Enns falling into the Danube, and the precipitous left bank of the Danube, covered with pine forest, with a mysterious distance of green tree-tops and bluish gorges. Beyond the pine forest, that looked wild and untouched by the hand of man, rose the turrets of a nunnery; and in the far distance in front, on the hill on the further side of the Enns, could be seen the scouts of the enemy.\n Between the cannons on the height stood the general in command of the rear-guard and an officer of the suite scanning the country through a field-glass. A little behind them, there sat on the trunk of a cannon, Nesvitsky, who had been despatched by the commander-in-chief to the rear-guard. The Cossack who accompanied Nesvitsky had handed him over a knapsack and a flask, and Nesvitsky was regaling the officers with pies and real doppel-k?mmel. The officers surrounded him in a delighted circle, some on their knees, some sitting cross-legged, like Turks, on the wet grass.\n “Yes, there was some sense in that Austrian prince who built a castle here. It\u0027s a magnificent spot. Why aren\u0027t you eating, gentlemen?” said Nesvitsky.\n “Thank you very much, prince,” answered one of the officers, enjoying the opportunity of talking to a staff-official of such importance. “It\u0027s a lovely spot. We marched right by the park; we saw two deer and such a splendid house!”\n “Look, prince,” said another, who would dearly have liked to take another pie, but was ashamed to, and therefore affected to be gazing at the countryside; “look, our infantry have just got in there. Over there, near the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something. They will clean out that palace nicely,” he said, with evident approval.\n “No doubt,” said Nesvitsky. “No; but what I should like,” he added, munching a pie in his moist, handsome mouth, “would be to slip in there.” He pointed to the turreted nunnery that could be seen on the mountainside. He smiled, his eyes narrowing and gleaming. “Yes, that would be first-rate, gentlemen!” The officers laughed.\n “One might at least scare the nuns a little. There are Italian girls, they say, among them. Upon my word, I\u0027d give five years of my life for it!”\n “They must be bored, too,” said an officer who was rather bolder, laughing.\n Meanwhile the officer of the suite, who was standing in front, pointed something out to the general; the general looked through the field-glass.\n “Yes, so it is, so it is,” said the general angrily, taking the field-glass away from his eye and shrugging his shoulders; “they are going to fire at them at the crossing of the river. And why do they linger so?”\n With the naked eye, looking in that direction, one could discern the enemy and their batteries, from which a milky-white smoke was rising. The smoke was followed by the sound of a shot in the distance, and our troops were unmistakably hurrying to the place of crossing.\n Nesvitsky got up puffing and went up to the general, smiling.\n “Wouldn\u0027t your excellency take some lunch?” he said.\n “It\u0027s a bad business,” said the general, without answering him; “our men have been too slow.”\n “Shouldn\u0027t I ride over, your excellency?” said Nesvitsky.\n “Yes, ride over, please,” said the general, repeating an order that had already once before been given in detail; “and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to burn the bridge, as I sent orders, and that they\u0027re to overhaul the burning materials on the bridge.”\n “Very good,” answered Nesvitsky. He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to pick up the knapsack and flask, and lightly swung his heavy person into the saddle.\n “Upon my word, I am going to pay a visit to the nuns,” he said to the officers who were watching him, smiling, and he rode along the winding path down the mountain.\n “Now then, captain, try how far it\u0027ll carry,” said the general, turning to the artillery officer. “Have a little fun to pass the time.”\n “Men, to the guns!” commanded the officer, and in a moment the gunners ran gaily from the camp fires and loaded the big guns.\n “One!” they heard the word of command. Number one bounded back nimbly. The cannon boomed with a deafening metallic sound, and whistling over the heads of our men under the mountainside, the grenade flew across, and falling a long way short of the enemy showed by the rising smoke where it had fallen and burst.\n The faces of the soldiers and officers lightened up at the sound. Every one got up and busily watched the movements of our troops below, which could be seen as in the hollow of a hand, and the movements of the advancing enemy. At the same instant, the sun came out fully from behind the clouds, and the full note of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine melted into a single inspiriting impression of light-hearted gaiety.\n 时值温和的细雨濛濛的秋天。护卫桥梁的俄国炮台所坐落的高地前所展现的辽阔的远景，时而突被纱幔般的斜雨所遮蔽，时而显得很开阔，艳阳照耀下的景致仿佛涂了一层清油漆，从远处也清晰可辨。脚底下的小市镇里，一幢幢白垩垩的房屋、红彤彤的顶盖、大教堂和桥梁——桥梁两侧川流不息的俄国军队的乌合之众，都已尽收眼底。可以看见多瑙河湾的船舶和孤岛，恩斯河和多瑙河汇合点所围绕的花园城寨，可以看见一片松林覆盖的陡峭的多瑙河左岸和那神秘远方的碧绿的山峰和蔚蓝色的隘口，可以看见突露在仿佛未曾砍伐的野生松林后面的寺院塔楼和恩斯河彼岸的远山前的敌军骑兵侦察分队。\n 在这座高地的几尊大炮之间，一个率领后卫部队的将军随同一名侍从军官在前面站着，并用望远镜观察地形。在他们背后几步路远的地方，由总司令派往后卫部队的涅斯维茨基正坐在炮架尾部。伴随涅斯维茨基的哥萨克把背囊和军用水壶递过来，涅斯维茨基于是用馅饼和纯正的茴香甜酒款待军官们。军官们高高兴兴地把他围在中间，有的人跪着，有的人像土耳其人那样盘着腿儿坐在湿漉漉的草地上。\n “这个奥国公爵不是笨蛋，在这儿修建了一座城寨。这是个顶好的地方。先生们，你们干嘛不吃呢？”涅斯维茨基说道。\n “公爵，十分感谢，”一名军官答道，和这样一位显要的司令部官员谈话，他觉得非常高兴。“优美的地方。我们从公园近侧走过时，看见两只鹿，房子多么华丽啊！”\n “公爵，请您看看吧，”另一位军官说道，他很想再拿一个馅饼，但是觉得不好意思，便装出环顾地形的样子，“请看，我们的步兵已经到达那个地方，走得这么远啊。就是在那个地方，在村庄后面的草地上，有三个人正在拖曳着什么东西，他们要给这座宫殿建筑物除去杂草。”他现出一副明显的称赞的样子，说道。\n “即使是那样，即使是那样，”涅斯维茨基说道。“可是，我很想，”他补充一句话，一面用他那长得好看的湿润的嘴咀嚼着馅饼，“那末，到那个地方去吧。”\n 他指了指在山上望得见的有塔楼的寺院。他微微一笑，眼睛眯起来，炯炯有神光。\n “先生们，这才真是一派秀气啊！”\n 军官们笑了起来。\n “吓一吓尼姑也好。据说有些是意大利的少女哩。说实在的，我宁可豁出五年的时光！”\n “她们本来就够寂寞的哩。”一个更有胆量的军官面露微笑，说道。\n 其时，站在前头的侍从军官正把什么指给将军看，将军便拿着景物望远镜观望。\n “真是这样，真是这样，”将军愤怒地说道，放下望远镜，耸一耸肩，“真是这样的，敌人要打渡头了，他们干嘛在那儿耽误时间呢？”\n 大河彼岸，用肉眼可以看见敌军和他们的炮台，从那炮台中冒出乳白色的硝烟，硝烟后面传来了远方的炮声，可以看见我们的军队急急忙忙地渡河。\n 涅斯维茨基呼哧呼哧喘着气，站起身来，面露微笑地向将军面前走去。\n “大人，要吃点东西么？”他说道。\n “真糟糕，”将军没有回答他的话，说道，“我们的军队磨蹭起来了。”\n “大人，要不要去走一趟呢？”涅斯维茨基说道。\n “对，请您去走一趟，”将军说道，他又把已经详细地吩咐的事重说一遍，“告诉骠骑兵，依照我的吩咐，最后一批渡河，烧毁桥梁，而且还要察看一下桥上引火用的燃料。”\n “很好。”涅斯维茨基答道。\n 他向牵马的哥萨克兵喊了一声，吩咐他收拾背囊和军用水壶，轻巧地把他那沉重的身躯翻上马鞍。\n “说真的，我要找尼姑去了。”他向面露微笑望着他的军官们说道，于是就沿着一条蜿蜒曲折的小道下山去了。\n “喂，上尉，开一炮，看看能射到什么地方去！”将军把脸转向炮兵说道，“真烦闷，开开心吧。”\n “炮手们各就各位！”一名军官发出了口令，须臾之后，炮手们都很快活地从篝火旁边跑出来，装上炮弹。\n “第一号，放！”发出了口令。\n 第一号炮兵迅速地跳开。大炮发出震耳欲聋的隆隆声，一枚榴弹从山下我军官兵头上飞过，发出一阵呼啸，榴弹落下的地方，冒出滚滚的硝烟，爆炸了，榴弹离敌军阵地还有很远一段路。\n 在这隆隆的炮声中，官兵们脸上都流露着愉快的神情；全体都站立起来，观察那了若指掌的山下我军的动态，观察那逐渐靠近的敌军的动态。这时候，太阳完全从云堆里探出头来。这一声单调的好听的炮响和耀眼的阳光汇合在一起了，使人产生一种激励的愉快的印象。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3329.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
