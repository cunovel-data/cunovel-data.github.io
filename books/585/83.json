{"id":41058,"no":83,"title":"Book 5 Chapter 2","content":"“I HAVE THE PLEASURE of speaking to Count Bezuhov, if I am not mistaken,” said the stranger, in a loud deliberate voice. Pierre looked in silence and inquiringly over his spectacles at the speaker. “I have heard of you,” continued the stranger, “and I have heard, sir, of what has happened to you, of your misfortune.” He underlined, as it were, the last word, as though to say: “Yes, misfortune, whatever you call it, I know that what happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.”\n “I am very sorry for it, sir.” Pierre reddened, and hurriedly dropping his legs over the edge of the bed, he bent forward towards the old man, smiling timidly and unnaturally.\n “I have not mentioned this to you, sir, from curiosity, but from graver reasons.” He paused, not letting Pierre escape from his gaze, and moved aside on the sofa, inviting him by this movement to sit beside him. Pierre disliked entering into conversation with this old man, but involuntarily submitting to him, he came and sat down beside him.\n “You are unhappy, sir,” he went on, “you are young, and I am old. I should like, as far as it is in my power, to help you.”\n “Oh, yes,” said Pierre, with an unnatural smile. “Very much obliged to you … where have you been travelling from?” The stranger\u0027s face was not cordial, it was even cold and severe, but in spite of that, both the speech and the face of his new acquaintance were irresistibly attractive to Pierre.\n “But if for any reason you dislike conversing with me,” said the old man, “then you say so, sir.” And suddenly he smiled a quite unexpected smile of fatherly kindliness.\n “Oh, no, not at all; on the contrary, I am very glad to make your acquaintance,” said Pierre, and glancing once more at the stranger\u0027s hands, he examined the ring more closely. He saw the head of Adam, the token of masonry.\n “Allow me to inquire,” he said, “are you a mason?”\n “Yes, I belong to the brotherhood of the freemasons,” said the stranger, looking now more searchingly into Pierre\u0027s eyes. “And from myself and in their name I hold out to you a brotherly hand.”\n “I am afraid,” said Pierre, smiling and hesitating between the confidence inspired in him by the personality of the freemason and the habit of ridiculing the articles of the masons\u0027 creed; “I am afraid that I am very far from a comprehension—how shall I say—I am afraid that my way of thinking in regard to the whole theory of the universe is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another.”\n “I am aware of your way of thinking,” said the freemason, “and that way of thinking of which you speak, which seems to you the result of your own thought, is the way of thinking of the majority of men, and is the invariable fruit of pride, indolence, and ignorance. Excuse my saying, sir, that if I had not been aware of it, I should not have addressed you. Your way of thinking is a melancholy error.”\n “Just as I may take for granted that you are in error,” said Pierre, faintly smiling.\n “I would never be so bold as to say I know the truth,” said the mason, the definiteness and decision of whose manner of speaking impressed Pierre more and more. “No one alone can attain truth; only stone upon stone, with the co-operation of all, by the millions of generations from our first father Adam down to our day is that temple being reared that should be a fitting dwelling-place of the Great God,” said the freemason, and he shut his eyes.\n “I ought to tell you that I don\u0027t believe, don\u0027t … believe in God,” said Pierre regretfully and with effort, feeling it essential to speak the whole truth.\n The freemason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man, holding millions in his hands, might smile to a poor wretch, who should say to him that he, the poor man, has not five roubles that would secure his happiness.\n “Yes, you do not know Him, sir,” said the freemason. “You cannot know Him. You know not Him, that is why you are unhappy.”\n “Yes, yes, I am unhappy,” Pierre assented; “but what am I to do?”\n “You know not Him, sir, and that\u0027s why you are very unhappy. You know not Him, but He is here, He is within me, He is in my words, He is in thee, and even in these scoffing words that thou hast just uttered,” said the mason in a stern, vibrating voice.\n He paused and sighed, evidently trying to be calm.\n “If He were not,” he said softly, “we should not be speaking of Him, sir. Of what, of whom were we speaking? Whom dost thou deny?” he said all at once, with enthusiastic austerity and authority in his voice. “Who invented Him, if He be not? How came there within thee the conception that there is such an incomprehensible Being? How comes it that thou and all the world have assumed the existence of such an inconceivable Being, a Being all powerful, eternal and infinite in all His qualities? …” He stopped and made a long pause.\n Pierre could not and would not interrupt this silence.\n “He exists, but to comprehend Him is hard,” the mason began again, not looking into Pierre\u0027s face, but straight before him, while his old hands, which could not keep still for inward emotion, turned the leaves of the book. “If it had been a man of whose existence thou hadst doubts, I could have brought thee the man, taken him by the hand, and shown him thee. But how am I, an insignificant mortal, to show all the power, all the eternity, all the blessedness of Him to one who is blind, or to one who shuts his eyes that he may not see, may not understand Him, and may not see, and not understand all his own vileness and viciousness.” He paused. “Who art thou? What art thou? Thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter those scoffing words,” he said, with a gloomy and scornful irony, “while thou art more foolish and artless than a little babe, who, playing with the parts of a cunningly fashioned watch, should rashly say that because he understands not the use of that watch, he does not believe in the maker who fashioned it. To know Him is a hard matter. For ages, from our first father Adam to our day, have we been striving for this knowledge, and are infinitely far from the attainment of our aim; but in our lack of understanding we see only our own weakness and His greatness …”\n Pierre gazed with shining eyes into the freemason\u0027s face, listening with a thrill at his heart to his words; he did not interrupt him, nor ask questions, but with all his soul he believed what this strange man was telling him. Whether he believed on the rational grounds put before him by the freemason, or believed, as children do, through the intonations, the conviction, and the earnestness, of the mason\u0027s words, the quiver in his voice that sometimes almost broke his utterance, or the gleaming old eyes that had grown old in that conviction, or the calm, the resolution, and the certainty of his destination, which were conspicuous in the whole personality of the old man, and struck Pierre with particular force, beside his own abjectness and hopelessness,—any way, with his whole soul he longed to believe, and believed and felt a joyful sense of soothing, of renewal, and of return to life.\n “It is not attained by the reason, but by life,” said the mason.\n “I don\u0027t understand,” said Pierre, feeling with dismay that doubt was stirring within him. He dreaded obscurity and feebleness in the freemason\u0027s arguments, he dreaded being unable to believe in him. “I don\u0027t understand,” he said, “in what way human reason cannot attain that knowledge of which you speak.”\n The freemason smiled his mild, fatherly smile.\n “The highest wisdom and truth is like the purest dew, which we try to hold within us,” said he. “Can I hold in an impure vessel that pure dew and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself can I bring that dew contained within me to some degree of purity.”\n “Yes, yes; that\u0027s so,” Pierre said joyfully.\n “The highest wisdom is founded not on reason only, not on those worldly sciences, of physics, history, chemistry, etc., into which knowledge of the intellect is divided. The highest wisdom is one. The highest wisdom knows but one science—the science of the whole, the science that explains the whole creation and the place of man in it. To instil this science into one\u0027s soul, it is needful to purify and renew one\u0027s inner man, and so, before one can know, one must believe and be made perfect. And for the attainment of these aims there has been put into our souls the light of God, called the conscience.”\n “Yes, yes,” Pierre assented.\n “Look with the spiritual eye into thy inner man, and ask of thyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou attained with the guidance of the intellect alone? What art thou? You are young, you are wealthy, you are cultured, sir. What have you made of all the blessings vouchsafed you? Are you satisfied with yourself and your life?”\n “No, I hate my life,” said Pierre, frowning.\n “Thou hatest it; then change it, purify thyself, and as thou art purified, thou wilt come to know wisdom. Look at your life, sir. How have you been spending it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, taking everything from society and giving nothing in return. You have received wealth. How have you used it? What have you done for your neighbour? Have you given a thought to the tens of thousands of your slaves, have you succoured them physically and morally? No. You have profited by their toil to lead a dissipated life. That\u0027s what you have done. Have you chosen a post in the service where you might be of use to your neighbour? No. You have spent your life in idleness. Then you married, sir, took upon yourself the responsibility of guiding a young woman in life, and what have you done? You have not helped her, sir, to find the path of truth, but have cast her into an abyss of deception and misery. A man injured you, and you have killed him, and you say you do not know God, and that you hate your life. There is no wisdom in all that, sir.”\n After these words the freemason leaned his elbow again on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes, as though weary of prolonged talking. Pierre gazed at that stern, immovable, old, almost death-like face, and moved his lips without uttering a sound. He wanted to say, “Yes, a vile, idle, vicious life,” and he dared not break the silence. The freemason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called his servant.\n “How about horses?” he asked, without looking at Pierre.\n “They have brought round some that were given up,” answered the old man. “You won\u0027t rest?”\n “No, tell them to harness them.”\n “Can he really be going away and leaving me all alone, without telling me everything and promising me help?” thought Pierre, getting up with downcast head, beginning to walk up and down the room, casting a glance from time to time at the freemason. “Yes, I had not thought of it, but I have led a contemptible, dissolute life, but I did not like it, and I didn\u0027t want to,” thought Pierre, “and this man knows the truth, and if he liked he could reveal it to me.” Pierre wanted to say this to the freemason and dared not. After packing his things with his practised old hands, the traveller buttoned up his sheepskin. On finishing these preparations, he turned to Bezuhov, and in a polite, indifferent tone, said to him:\n “Where are you going now, sir?”\n “I? … I\u0027m going to Petersburg,” answered Pierre in a tone of childish indecision. “I thank you. I agree with you in everything. But do not suppose that I have been so bad. With all my soul I have desired to be what you would wish me to be; but I have never met with help from any one.… Though I was myself most to blame for everything. Help me, instruct me, and perhaps I shall be able …”\n Pierre could not say more; his voice broke and he turned away.\n The freemason was silent, obviously pondering something.\n “Help comes only from God,” he said, “but such measure of aid as it is in the power of our order to give you, it will give you, sir. You go to Petersburg, and give this to Count Villarsky” (he took out his notebook and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded into four). “One piece of advice let me give you. When you reach the capital, devote your time at first there to solitude and to self-examination, and do not return to your old manner of life. Therewith I wish you a good journey, sir,” he added, noticing that his servant had entered the room, “and all success …”\n “如果我没有出差错，我有幸正在和别祖霍夫伯爵攀谈。”过路客人从容不迫地大声地说。皮埃尔沉默不言，用那疑问的目光透过眼镜注视着他的对话人。 \n “久闻大名，”过路客人继续说，“我也听说阁下遭遇不幸，”他好像强调最后一个词，好像他说了一句：“是的，不幸，不管您是怎样说，我还是知道，您在莫斯科发生的事，是一大不幸，”“阁下，对此我深表遗憾。”\n 皮埃尔面红耳赤，急忙从床上放下一双脚，向老头弯下腰来，不自然地、畏葸地露出微笑。\n “阁下，我不是出于好奇而向您提到这件事情，而是因为更重要的缘由。”他沉默半晌，一直盯着皮埃尔，坐在沙发上向前移动一下身子，用这个姿势请皮埃尔在他身旁坐下来。皮埃尔很不愿意和这个老头谈话，但他情不自禁地顺从他的意思，走过去，在他身旁坐下来。\n “阁下，您很不幸，”他继续说道，“您很年轻，我已经老了。我愿意竭尽全力地帮助您。”\n “哎呀，”皮埃尔面露不自然的微笑说，“我很感谢您……请问您从哪里来？”过路客人的面容显得不和蔼，甚至冷漠而严峻，虽然如此，但是新相识的言谈和面容却对皮埃尔产生强烈的魅力。\n “但是，如果我们之间的谈话因为某种缘故会使您感到不愉快的话，”老头子说，“那末，阁下，就请您率直地说。”于是他忽然出乎意外地流露出父亲般温柔的微笑。\n “啊，不是这么回事，根本不是这么回事，相反地，和您交朋友我很高兴。”皮埃尔说，他又向新相识的手上瞥了一眼，距离更近地仔细瞧了一下他的戒指，他看见了戒指上刻出的骷髅图样——共济会的标志。\n “请您允许我问问，”他说道，“您是共济会员吗？”\n “是的，我属于共济会，”过路客人说，越来越深情地谛视皮埃尔的眼睛。“我代表我自己，并且代表他们向您伸出友谊的手。”\n “我怕，”皮埃尔说，流露出微笑，在共济会员个人对他的信任和他对共济会员信仰的嘲笑这一习惯之间，他摇摆不定，“我怕我头脑简单，难以理解，怎么说呢，我怕我对整个宇宙的观点和您大有径庭，我们是不能相互理解的。”\n “我熟悉您的观点，”共济会员说，“您所说的那种观点对于您仿佛是思维活动的产物，这是大多数人的观点，也就是骄傲、懒惰和愚昧造成的同样的后果。阁下，请您原谅我，如果我不熟悉它，我就不会跟您谈话了。您的观点是一种可悲的谬见。”\n “正如我所能推断的那样，您也陷入了谬误之中。”皮埃尔面露微笑时说。\n “我决不敢说，我洞悉真理，”共济会员说，他以那明确而坚定的言词越来越使皮埃尔感到惊讶。“谁也不能独自一人获得真理，从我们的始祖亚当到我们当代，只有依靠千百万代人的共同参与，才能一砖一瓦地兴建起不愧称为伟大上帝所在地的庙堂。”共济会员把话说完后，闭起了眼睛。\n “我应当对您说，我不信仰，不……信仰上帝。”皮埃尔深感遗憾地、吃力地说，他觉得必须把真情全部说出来。\n 共济会员仔细地瞧瞧皮埃尔，微微一笑，那神态就像拥有百万家财的富翁对一个穷人露出微笑似的，穷人想对富翁说，他这个穷人缺乏能够使他幸福的五个卢布。\n “是的，阁下，您不知道他，”共济会员说，“您不可能知道他。您不知道他，所以您也不幸。”\n “是啊，是啊，我不幸，”皮埃尔承认，“可是，我应该怎么办呢？”\n “您不知道他，阁下，所以您很不幸。您不知道他，不过他就开这儿，他在我心中，他在我的话语中，他在你心中，甚至在你甫才说的那些亵渎的话语中。”共济会员用那严肃的、颤抖的声音说。\n 他沉默片刻，叹了一口气，看来他力图镇静下来。\n “如果他不存在，”他轻声地说，“我和您就不会谈到他，阁下，我们谈到的是什么？是谁？你否定谁呢？”他忽然说道，话音中带有极度兴奋的威严的意味。“既然他不存在，是谁臆想出来的？为什么在你身上会有一个假设；有这么样的不可理解的内心世界？为什么你和全世界已经推测出这种不可思议的内心世界——具有万能、永恒和无限这些特性的内心世界的存在？……”他停下来，很久地沉默不言。\n 皮埃尔不能，也不愿意打破这种沉默。\n “他是存在的，可是难以理解他。”共济会员又说起话来，他的眼睛不是向皮埃尔的面庞，而是向他自己前面望去，那两只老年人的手翻动着书页，由于内心的激动，这双手不能静止不动。“如果他是一个人，你怀疑这个人的存在，我可以把他领到你身边来，一把抓住他的手，给你瞧瞧。但是我这个微不足道的凡人怎么能向那个盲目的、或者熟视无睹的、不去理解他而且有目也看不清也不明了自己的肮脏行为和缺陷的人展示他的万能、永恒和仁慈呢？他沉默一会儿，“你是什么人？你是什么东西？你自命不凡，认为你是个贤人，因为你会道出这些亵渎的话，”他含着阴悒的讥笑说。“你比小孩更愚蠢、更不明事理，小孩玩耍精工钟表零件时，会冒失地说他不信任制造钟表的师傅，其原因是，他不明了钟表的用途。认识上帝是很困难的。从始祖亚当到我们今天，许多个世纪以来，我们一直为这种认识而进行工作，但是我们还远远未能达到目的，我们都认为，不理解上帝只是我们的弱点和他的伟大……”\n 皮埃尔极度紧张，用那明亮的眼睛瞅着共济会员的面孔，听他说下去，没有打断他的话，也不问什么，而是诚心地相信这个陌生人对他说的话。他是否相信共济会员言谈中合乎情理的论据，或者像儿童一样相信共济会员发言的语调、坚强信念和热忱、相信嗓音的颤抖有时几乎会打断共济会员的发言，或者相信老年人这对由于信仰而变得衰老的闪闪发亮的眼睛，或者相信从共济会员整个内心世界中闪耀出光辉的那种沉着和坚定以及对自己使命的认识；与皮埃尔的颓丧和失望相比照，共济会员的这些特点使皮埃尔大为惊讶，他诚心地希望确立自己的信念，而且也这样做了，他体会到一种安泰、更新和复活的快感。\n “上帝不是靠智慧所能理解的，而是要在生活中去理解。”\n 共济会员说。\n “我不明白，”皮埃尔说，他恐惧地感觉到自己心中升起了疑团。他害怕对话人的模糊不清的、难以令人信服的论据，他害怕不相信他，“我不明白，”他说道，“人类的智慧怎么不能领悟您所说的知识。”\n 共济会员流露出慈父般的温顺的微笑。\n “至高的智慧和真理仿佛是我们要吸收的最清洁的水分，”他说，“我是否能把这种清洁的水分装进不清洁的器皿，再来评论它的洁净呢？只有从内心洗涤我自己，才能使吸收的水分达到某种洁净的程度。”\n “是啊，是啊，正是这样！”皮埃尔高兴地说。\n “至高的智慧的根基不光是理性，也不是理性知识所划分的世俗的物理学、历史学、化学及其他。至高的智慧是独一无二的。至高智慧包含有一门科学，即是包罗万象的科学、解释整个宇宙和人类在宇宙中所占地位的科学。为了给自己灌输这门科学，就必须洗净和刷新人的内心，因此在汲取知识之前，务必要有所信仰，对自己加以改造。为了达到这种目的，我们的灵魂中容纳了所谓良心的上帝之光。”\n “对，对。”皮埃尔承认他说的话是对的。\n “请你用精神的眼睛望望自己的内心，问问你自己，你是否满意自己？你单凭智慧获得了什么成就？你是个什么样的人呢？阁下，您非常年轻、您非常富有、您非常聪明而且有学问。您凭赐予您的这些财富做出了什么事业？您是否满意自己和您自己的生活？”\n “不，我仇恨自己的生活。”皮埃尔皱着眉头说。\n “你仇恨生活，那末你就改变它吧，你净化自己吧，在你净化的时候，你就会认识智慧。阁下，您看看自己的生活吧。您是怎样过活的？在狂欢暴饮和淫逸的生活中，您向社会得到一切，却未为它作出任何贡献。您得到了财富。您是怎样花掉的？您为他人作了什么？您是否为几万奴隶着想？您是否在智力和体力上帮了他们的忙？并没有。您享用他们的劳动，过着淫荡的生活。您就是干了这种勾当。您是否已经选择了一个服务地点，在那里您可以给他人带来好处？并没有。您是过着游手好闲的生活。您后来结婚了，阁下，承担了教导年轻妇女的责任，您究竟做了什么呢？您没有帮助她寻找真理的道路，却使她陷入虚伪和不幸的深渊。有个人侮辱您，您竟然把他打死，您说您不知道上帝，您仇视自己的生活。阁下，这里头没有什么不易于了解的东西！”\n 说完这些话之后，共济会员好像由于不停地谈天，谈得太久，谈疲倦了，他又把胳膊肘支撑在沙发背上，合拢了眼睛。皮埃尔注视这个老年人的很严肃的、一动不动的、几乎露出死色的面孔，他的嘴唇不出声地颤动着。他想这样说：是的，这是令人厌恶的、淫荡的、闲逸的生活，——他不敢打破沉默。\n 共济会员老态龙钟地、嗓子嘶哑地咳嗽几声，清清喉咙，又向仆人喊了一声。\n “驿马怎么样了？”他不看皮埃尔一眼，便问道。\n “牵来了驿马，”仆人回答，“您不再休息吗？”\n “不，去吩咐驾马。”\n “他难道真要离开了，不把话说完，也没有答应帮助我，就把我一人留在这儿吗？”皮埃尔一面想道，一面站起来，低下头，有时候看看共济会员，开始在房里踱来踱去。“是的，我未曾想到这一点，但是我过着令人蔑视的淫荡的生活，不过我不喜欢这种生活，也不希望有这种生活。”皮埃尔想道，“这个人知道真理，只要他乐意，他是会向我揭示真理的。”皮埃尔想说这句话，但是不敢把它说给共济会员听。过路客人用那老年人习惯做事的手收拾好东西，扣上皮袄。他做完这几件事以后就向别祖霍夫转过脸去，用那冷淡的恭敬的口吻对他说：\n “阁下，请问您现在到哪里去？”\n “我？……我到彼得堡去，”皮埃尔用童稚的不坚定的嗓音回答。“我对您表示感谢。我在各方面同意您的看法。但是您不要以为我很坏。我诚心地希望做一个您希望我做的那样的人，但是我从来没有获得任何人的帮助……其实，首先要说的是，我本人在各方面都有过错。您帮助我吧，您教教我吧，说不定，我将是……”皮埃尔不能继续说下去，他从鼻子里发出喘息声，转过身去。\n “只有上帝才会助人，”他说，“但是阁下，上帝赐予您的，却是我们共济会有权赐予的帮助。您到彼得堡去，把这样东西交给维拉尔斯基伯爵（他掏出一个公文夹，在一大张四折纸上写了几个字）。请允许我给您一个忠告。到达首都后，初时要闭门幽居，检讨自己，不宜走上从前的生活道路。然后祝您一路福星，事业成功……阁下。”他发觉他的仆人走进房里以后，说了这句话。\n 皮埃尔从驿站长的旅客登记簿上获悉，这个过路客人就是奥西普·阿列克谢耶维奇·巴兹杰耶夫。巴兹杰耶夫早在诺维科夫时期就是最闻名的共济会员和马工派神秘教徒。他走后过了很久，皮埃尔并没有就寝，也没有去要换乘的马匹，就在驿站上的房间里踱来踱去，回想（他自己耽于淫逸的往事，并且怀着革新的喜悦，想象到那个他认为惬意的、安乐的、无瑕可剔的、注重德行的未来。他仿佛觉得，他之所以行为不端，只是因为他偶尔忘却做一个道德高尚的人是多么优秀罢了。他的心灵中不再残存有以前那种怀疑的印迹了。他坚信，人们在通往美德的途中，以互相扶持为目的而和衷共济是切实可行的，他想象中的共济会就是如此的。\n
