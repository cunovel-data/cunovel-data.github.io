{"id":41273,"no":298,"title":"Book 14 Chapter 5","content":"THE RAIN was over, but a mist was falling and drops of water dripped from the branches of the trees. Denisov, the esaul, and Petya, in silence, followed the peasant in the pointed cap, who, stepping lightly and noiselessly in his bast shoes over roots and wet leaves, led them to the edge of the wood.\\n\\n Coming out on the road, the peasant paused, looked about him, and turned toward a thin screen of trees. He stood still at a big oak, still covered with leaves, and beckoned mysteriously to them.\\n\\n Denisov and Petya rode up to him. From the place where the peasant was standing the French could be seen. Just beyond the wood a field of spring corn ran sharply downhill. On the right, across a steep ravine, could be seen a little village and a manor-house with the roofs broken down. In that village and in the house and all over the high ground in the garden, by the wells and the pond, and all along the road uphill from the bridge to the village, not more than five hundred yards away, crowds of men could be seen in the shifting mist. They could distinctly hear their foreign cries at the horses pulling the baggage uphill and their calls to one another.\\n\\n “Give me the prisoner here,” said Denisov, in a low voice, never taking his eyes off the French.\\n\\n A Cossack got off his horse, lifted the boy down, and came with him to Denisov. Denisov, pointing to the French, asked the boy what troops they were. The boy, thrusting his chilled hands into his pockets and raising his eyebrows, looked in dismay at Denisov, and in spite of his unmistakable desire to tell all he knew, he was confused in his answers, and merely repeated Denisov\u0027s questions. Denisov, frowning, turned away from him, and addressing the esaul, told him his own views on the matter.\\n\\n Petya, turning his head rapidly, looked from the drummer to Denisov, and from the esaul to the French in the village and on the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.\\n\\n “Whether Dolohov comes or not, we must take them.… Eh?” said Denisov, his eyes sparkling merrily.\\n\\n “It is a convenient spot,” said the esaul.\\n\\n “We will send the infantry down below, by the marshes,” Denisov went on. “They will creep up to the garden; you dash down with the Cossacks from there”—Denisov pointed to the wood beyond the village—“and I from here with my hussars. And at a shot …”\\n\\n “It won\u0027t do to go by the hollow; it\u0027s a bog,” said the esaul. “The horses will sink in, you must skirt round more to the left.…”\\n\\n While they were talking in undertones, there was the crack of a shot and a puff of white smoke in the hollow below near the pond, and the voices of hundreds of Frenchmen halfway up the hill rose in a ringing shout, as though in merry chorus. At the first minute both Denisov and the esaul darted back. They were so near that they fancied they were the cause of that shot and those shouts. But they had nothing to do with them. A man in something red was running through the marshes below. The French were evidently firing and shouting at him.\\n\\n “Why, it\u0027s our Tihon,” said the esaul.\\n\\n “It\u0027s he! it\u0027s he!”\\n\\n “The rogue,” said Denisov.\\n\\n “He\u0027ll get away!” said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.\\n\\n The man they called Tihon, running up to the little river, splashed into it, so that the water spurted up round him, and disappearing for an instant, scrambled out on all fours, looking dark from the water, and ran on. The French, who had been pursuing him, stopped.\\n\\n “Well, he\u0027s a smart fellow,” said the esaul.\\n\\n “The beast,” said Denisov, with the same expression of vexation. “And what has he been about all this time?”\\n\\n “Who is he?” asked Petya.\\n\\n “It\u0027s our scout. I sent him to catch a ‘tongue\u0027 for us.”\\n\\n “Ah, to be sure,” said Petya, nodding at Denisov\u0027s first word, as though he knew all about it, though he did not understand a word.\\n\\n Tihon Shtcherbatov was one of the most useful men among Denisov\u0027s followers. He was a peasant of the village of Pokrovskoe, near Gzhat. Denisov had come to Pokrovskoe early in his operations as a guerilla leader, and sending, as he always did, for the village elder, asked him what he knew about the French.\\n\\n The village elder had answered, as all village elders always did answer, that he knew nothing about them, and had seen nothing of them. But when Denisov explained to him that his object was to kill the French, and inquired whether no French had strayed into his village, the village elder replied that there had been some miroders certainly, but that the only person who took any heed of such things was Tishka Shtcherbatov. Denisov ordered Tihon to be brought before him, and praising his activity, said in the presence of the elder a few words about the devotion to the Tsar and the Fatherland and the hatred of the French that all sons of the Fatherland must cherish in their hearts.\\n\\n “We don\u0027t do any harm to the French,” said Tihon, evidently scared at Denisov\u0027s words. “It\u0027s only, you know, just a bit of fun for the lads and me. The miroders now—we have killed a dozen or so of them, but we have done no harm else …”\\n\\n Next day, when Denisov was leaving Pokrovskoe, having forgotten all about this peasant, he was told that Tihon was with his followers, and asked to be allowed to remain with them. Denisov bade them let him stay.\\n\\n At first Tihon undertook the rough work of making fires, fetching water, skinning horses, and so on, but he soon showed great zeal and capacity for guerilla warfare. He would go after booty at night, and never failed to bring back French clothes and weapons, and when he was bidden, he would bring back prisoners too. Denisov took Tihon from his menial work, and began to employ him on expeditions, and to reckon him among the Cossacks.\\n\\n Tihon did not like riding, and always went on foot, yet never lagged behind the cavalry. His weapons were a musket, which he carried rather as a joke, a pike, and an axe, which he used as skilfully as a wolf does its teeth—catching fleas in its coat and crunching thick bones with them equally easily. With equal precision Tihon swinging his axe split logs, or, taking it by the head, cut thin skewers or carved spoons. Among Denisov\u0027s followers, Tihon was on a special footing of his own. When anything particularly disagreeable or revolting had to be done—to put one\u0027s shoulder to a waggon stuck in the mud, to drag a horse out of a bog by the tail, to flay a horse, to creep into the midst of the French, to walk fifty versts in a day—every one laughed, and looked to Tihon to do it.\\n\\n “No harm will come to him; the devil; he\u0027s a stalwart beast,” they used to say of him.\\n\\n One day a Frenchman he had captured wounded Tihon with a pistol-shot in the fleshy part of the back. This wound, which Tihon treated only by applications of vodka—internal and external—was the subject of the liveliest jokes through the whole party, and Tihon lent himself readily to their jests.\\n\\n “Well, old chap, you won\u0027t do that again! Are you crook-backed!” laughed the Cossacks; and Tihon, assuming a doleful face, and grimacing to pretend he was angry, would abuse the French with the most comical oaths. The effect of the incident on Tihon was that he rarely afterwards brought prisoners in.\\n\\n Tihon was the bravest and most useful man of the lot. No one discovered so many opportunities of attack, no one captured or killed so many Frenchmen. And consequently he was the favourite subject of all the gibes of the Cossacks and the hussars, and readily fell in with the position.\\n\\n Tihon had been sent overnight by Denisov to Shamshevo to capture a “tongue.” But either because he was not satisfied with one French prisoner, or because he had been asleep all night, he had crept by day into the bushes in the very middle of the French, and, as Denisov had seen from the hill, had been discovered by them.\\n\\n 他走上一道斜坡，停了一下，张望四周，然后朝一处树木稀疏的地方走过去，在一株叶子还没有掉落的大橡树下站住了，神秘地对他们招手。\\n\\n 杰尼索夫一行人走了过去。从农民向导站的地方可以看见法国人。一出森林，斜坡上是一块黑麦地。在右边。在一条陡峭的山谷对面，有一个小村子，村里有一所屋顶已坍塌的地主的住宅。在小村子里，在地主的住宅里，在整个山坡上，在花园里，在水井和池塘边，在从桥头到村庄二百米上坡的大道上，透过飘忽的大雾，可以看见成群结队的人。可以清楚地听见用非俄罗斯语言吆喝用力拉车上坡的马，可以听见他们互相呼应的声音。\\n\\n “把俘虏带过来。”杰尼索夫低声命令，他的眼睛仍然紧盯着那些法国人。\\n\\n 那个哥萨克把孩子抱下马，把他带到杰尼索夫跟前。杰尼索夫指着那些法国军队，向他是什么兵种。那孩子把冻僵的双手插进衣袋，抬起眼睛惊恐地望着杰尼索夫，他显然极力想把所知道的都说出来，他想回答好杰尼索夫的问题，但这孩子总是答非所问。杰尼索夫皱起眉头，转身把自己的推测告诉了哥萨克一等上尉。\\n\\n 彼佳迅速地转动着头，一忽儿看小鼓手，一忽儿看杰尼索夫，一忽儿看哥萨克一等上尉，一忽儿看村里和大路上的法国佬。生怕漏掉什么重要情况。\\n\\n “不管多洛霍夫来不来，应当拿下来！……嗯？”杰尼索夫闪了一闪愉快的目光说。\\n\\n “这个地方很好。”哥萨克一等上尉说。\\n\\n “派步兵下到那片洼地，”杰尼索夫继续说道，“他们可以向那个花园爬过去；您带领哥萨克骑兵从那儿过去，”杰尼索夫指着村后的一片树林，“我带领骠骑兵从这儿走。枪一响就全面出击……”\\n\\n “洼地过不去——有个泥潭，”哥萨克一等上尉说，“马会陷下去，要从左侧绕过去……”\\n\\n 正当他们在低声交谈时，在池塘旁边的洼地上啪的一声响了一枪，冒起一团白烟，接着又响了一枪，山坡上几百名法国人好像很快活地齐声呐喊。枪响时，杰尼索夫和哥萨克一等上尉往后退了一点。因为他们离法国人那么近，他们还以为枪声和呐喊声都是由他们引起的。然而这都与他们无关。在下面，一个身穿红色衣服的人迅速跑过洼地，显然法国人是向他射击和喊叫。“唉！这不是我们的吉洪吗？”哥萨克一等上尉说。\\n\\n “是他！正是他！”\\n\\n “嘿，这个调皮鬼。”杰尼索夫说。\\n\\n “跑掉了！”哥萨克一等上尉挤挤眼说道。\\n\\n 他们叫他做吉洪的那个人跑到河边，扑通一声跳入河中，三下两下爬上岸，成了个泥人，浑身发黑，爬起来又跑。追赶他的法国人在河边停住了脚。\\n\\n “呶，真麻利。”哥萨克一等上尉说。\\n\\n “好一个狡猾家伙，”杰尼索夫仍然带气忿的神情说，“直到现在他都在干些什么？”\\n\\n “他是什么人？”彼佳问。\\n\\n “是我们的侦察员。我派他去捉一个‘舌头\u0027。”\\n\\n “噢，原来这样。”彼佳刚听到了头一句话就点着头说，好像他全懂了，其实他一点也不懂。\\n\\n 吉洪·谢尔巴特是一个全队最有用的人。他原本是格扎特附近波克罗夫斯科耶村的农民。杰尼索夫开始打游击时来到波克罗夫斯科耶村，照例把村长叫来，问一下法国人的情况，这个村长也像所有的村长一样，好像是为了保护自己，一概回答说，闻所未闻。杰尼索夫向他们说明他的目的就是要消灭法国人。当再问及法国人窜来过没有？村长说，洋人确实来过，不过我们村只有季什卡·谢尔巴特①一个人应付他们。杰尼索夫吩咐把吉洪找来，称赞了他的活动，当着村长，说了几句，所有祖国的儿子都应当效忠于沙皇和祖国，都应当仇视法国人的话。 \\n\\n ①季什卡是吉洪的爱称。\\n\\n 吉洪起初只干些粗活，生火、担水、剥死马，等等，很快他对游击战表现出极大的爱好和才能。他常常在夜间去找战利品，经常能弄到法国人的服装和武器，派他去捉俘虏，他也能捉回来。杰尼索夫免去了他干杂活，外出侦察敌情时就把他带在身边，并把他编入哥萨克队伍。\\n\\n 吉洪不喜欢骑马，时常步行，但从来不会落在骑兵后面。他的武器是一支旧式大口径火枪，一根长茅和一把斧子；他带火枪主要是为了好玩，使唤斧子就像狼使唤牙一样，狼用牙很容易从皮毛里找到虱子，还可以啃大块的骨头。吉洪举起斧子劈木头，握着斧背削小撅子或挖刻小勺子，这些活干起来都得心应手，吉洪在杰尼索夫队伍里占有特殊的、独一无二的地位。每当要做某种困难的和讨厌的活的时候，如用肩膀把陷进泥里的大车顶出来，拽着马尾巴把马从泥泽中拉出来，偷偷混入法国人中间去，一天要走上五十俄国（一俄里等于一、六七公里——译者注）等活儿，人们总是笑嘻嘻地指着吉洪。\\n\\n “这个鬼东西，你拿他真的没办法，他健壮得像头牛。”人们都这样谈论他。\\n\\n 有一次吉洪要捉一个法国人，那人朝他打了一枪，子弹打在背上肉多的地方。吉洪只用伏特加酒内吸外擦，就把伤治好了，这件事成为全队打趣的笑话，而吉洪也乐意任大家来取笑。\\n\\n “怎么样，老兄，不干啦？给打趴下了？”哥萨克们对他嘲笑道。这时吉洪故意弯下腰，做个鬼脸，假装生气的样子，用最好笑的话咒骂法国人。这件事对吉洪的唯一的影响是，他在受伤后很少去捉俘虏了。\\n\\n 吉洪是队里最有用、最勇敢的人。没有谁比他找到的袭击机会更多，没有谁比他活捉的和打死的法国人更多；或许是由于这个缘故吧，他成了全体哥萨克和骠骑兵寻开心取笑的人物，而他也心甘情愿地充当这一角色。这一次是杰尼索夫在头一天晚上派他去沙姆舍沃村去捉一个“舌头”。可是，不知他是不满足于只捉一个俘虏呢，还是因为他在夜里睡过了头，他在大白天钻进了灌木林，钻进法国人中间去了，于是，正如杰尼索夫从山上看见的那样，被法国人发现了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3596.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
