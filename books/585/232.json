{"id":41207,"no":232,"title":"Book 11 Chapter 7","content":"ELLEN perceived that the matter was very simple and easy from the ecclesiastical point of view, but that her spiritual counsellors raised difficulties simply because they were apprehensive of the way in which it might be looked at by the temporal authorities.\\n\\n And, consequently, Ellen decided in her own mind that the way must be paved for society to look at the matter in the true light. She excited the jealousy of the old dignitary, and said the same thing to him as she had to her other suitor—that is, gave him to understand that the sole means of obtaining exclusive rights over her was to marry her. The elderly dignitary was, like the young foreign prince, for the first moment taken aback at this proposal of marriage from a wife whose husband was living. But Ellen\u0027s unfaltering confidence in asserting that it was a matter as simple and natural as the marriage of an unmarried girl had its effect on him too. Had the slightest traces of hesitation, shame, or reserve been perceptible in Ellen herself, her case would have been undoubtedly lost. But far from it; with perfect directness and simple-hearted na?veté, she told her intimate friends (and that term included all Petersburg), that both the prince and the dignitary had made her proposals of marriage, and that she loved both, and was afraid of grieving either.\\n\\n The rumour was immediately all over Petersburg—not that Ellen wanted a divorce from her husband (had such a rumour been discussed very many persons would have set themselves against any such illegal proceeding)—but that the unhappy, interesting Ellen was in hesitation which of her two suitors to marry. The question was no longer how far any marriage was possible, but simply which would be the more suitable match for her, and how the court would look at the question. There were, indeed, certain strait-laced people who could not rise to the high level of the subject, and saw in the project a desecration of the sanctity of marriage; but such persons were few in number, and they held their tongues; while the majority were interested in the question of Ellen\u0027s happiness, and which would be the better match for her. As to whether it were right or wrong for a wife to marry when her husband was alive, that was not discussed, as the question was evidently not a subject of doubt for persons “wiser than you and me” (as was said), and to doubt the correctness of their decision would be risking the betrayal of one\u0027s ignorance and absence of savoir faire.\\n\\n Marya Dmitryevna Ahrosimov, who had come that summer to Petersburg to see one of her sons, was the only person who ventured on the direct expression of a contrary opinion. Meeting Ellen at a ball, Marya Dmitryevna stopped her in the middle of the room, and in the midst of a general silence said to her, in her harsh voice:\\n\\n “So you are going to pass on from one husband to another, I hear! You think, I dare say, it\u0027s a new fashion you are setting. But you are not the first, madam. That\u0027s a very old idea. They do the same in all the …” And with these words, Marya Dmitryevna tucked up her broad sleeves with her usual menacing action, and looking severely round her, walked across the ballroom.\\n\\n Though people were afraid of Marya Dmitryevna, yet in Petersburg they looked on her as a sort of buffoon, and therefore of all her words they noticed only the last coarse one, and repeated it to one another in whispers, supposing that the whole point of her utterance lay in that.\\n\\n Prince Vassily had of late dropped into very frequently forgetting what he had said, and repeating the same phrase a hundred times; and every time he happened to see his daughter he used to say:\\n\\n “Ellen, I have a word to say to you,” he would say, drawing her aside and pulling her arm downwards. “I have got wind of certain projects relative to … you know. Well, my dear child, you know how my father\u0027s heart rejoices to know you are … You have suffered so much. But, my dear child, consult only your heart. That\u0027s all I tell you.” And concealing an emotion identical on each occasion, he pressed his cheek to his daughter\u0027s cheek and left her.\\n\\n Bilibin, who had not lost his reputation as a wit, was a disinterested friend of Ellen\u0027s; one of those friends always to be seen in the train of brilliant women, men friends who can never pass into the rank of lovers. One day, in a “small and intimate circle,” Bilibin gave his friend Ellen his views on the subject.\\n\\n “écoutez, Bilibin” (Ellen always called friends of the category to which Bilibin belonged by their surnames), and she touched his coat-sleeve with her white, beringed fingers. “Tell me, as you would a sister, what ought I to do? Which of the two?”\\n\\n Bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows, and pondered with a smile on his lips.\\n\\n “You do not take me unawares, you know,” he said. “As a true friend, I have thought, and thought again of your affair. You see, if you marry the prince”—(the younger suitor) he crooked his finger—“you lose forever the chance of marrying the other, and then you displease the court. (There is a sort of relationship, you know.) But if you marry the old count, you make the happiness of his last days. And then as widow of the great … the prince will not be making a mésalliance in marrying you …” and Bilibin let the wrinkles run out of his face.\\n\\n “That\u0027s a real friend!” said Ellen beaming, and once more touching Bilibin\u0027s sleeve. “But the fact is I love them both, and I don\u0027t want to make them unhappy. I would give my life for the happiness of both,” she declared.\\n\\n Bilibin shrugged his shoulders to denote that for such a trouble even he could suggest no remedy.\\n\\n “Une ma?tresse-femme! That is what\u0027s called putting the question squarely. She would like to be married to all three at once,” thought Bilibin.\\n\\n “But do tell me what is your husband\u0027s view of the question?” he said, the security of his reputation saving him from all fear of discrediting himself by so na?ve a question. “Does he consent?”\\n\\n “Oh, he is so fond of me!” said Ellen, who, for some unknown reason, fancied that Pierre too adored her. “Il fera tout pour moi.”\\n\\n Bilibin puckered up his face in preparation of the coming mot.\\n\\n “Même le divorce?” he said.\\n\\n Ellen laughed.\\n\\n Among the persons who ventured to question the legality of the proposed marriage was Ellen\u0027s mother, Princess Kuragin. She had constantly suffered pangs of envy of her daughter, and now when the ground for such envy was the one nearest to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the idea of it.\\n\\n She consulted a Russian priest to ascertain how far divorce and remarriage was possible for a woman in her husband\u0027s lifetime. The priest assured her that this was impossible; and to her delight referred her to the text in the Gospel in which (as it seemed to the priest) remarriage during the lifetime of the husband was directly forbidden.\\n\\n Armed with these arguments, which seemed to her irrefutable, Princess Kuragin drove round to her daughter\u0027s early one morning in order to find her alone.\\n\\n Ellen heard her mother\u0027s protests to the end, and smiled with bland sarcasm.\\n\\n “You see it is plainly said: ‘He who marryeth her that is divorced…\u0027 ”\\n\\n “O mamma, don\u0027t talk nonsense. You don\u0027t understand. In my position I have duties…” Ellen began, passing out of Russian into French, for in the former language she always felt a lack of clearness about her case.\\n\\n “But, my dear…”\\n\\n “O mamma, how is it you don\u0027t understand that the Holy Father, who has the right of granting dispensations…”\\n\\n At that moment the lady companion, who lived in Ellen\u0027s house, came in to announce that his highness was in the drawing-room, and wished to see her.\\n\\n “No, tell him I don\u0027t want to see him, that I am furious with him for not keeping his word.”\\n\\n “Countess, there is mercy for every sin,” said a young man with fair hair and a long face and long nose.\\n\\n The old princess rose respectfully and curtsied at his entrance. The young man took no notice of her. Princess Kuragin nodded to her daughter, and swam to the door.\\n\\n “Yes, she is right,” thought the old princess, all of whose convictions had been dissipated by the appearance of his highness on the scene. “She is right; but how was it in our youth—gone now for ever—we knew nothing of this? And it is so simple,” thought Princess Kuragin, as she settled herself in her carriage.\\n\\n At the beginning of August Ellen\u0027s affairs were settled, and she wrote to her husband (who, as she supposed, was deeply attached to her) a letter, in which she made known to him her intention of marrying N. N. She informed him also of her conversion to the one true faith, and begged him to go through all the necessary formalities for obtaining a divorce, of which the bearer of the letter would give him further details. “On which I pray God to have you in His holy and powerful keeping. Your friend, Ellen.”\\n\\n This letter was brought to Pierre\u0027s house at the time when he was on the field of Borodino.\\n\\n 所以，海伦决定，应该在社交界使这件事成熟。她激起那显贵的老家伙的醋意，对他说了对第一个追求者说过的同样的话，即摆明问题：得到占有她的权利的唯一途径，是同她结婚。在第一分钟内，这个丈夫还在世而又另嫁他人的建议，使这个年老的达官大为惊讶，那个青年人也有同感；但海伦毫不动摇地相信，这与姑娘家出嫁一样地简单而且自然，这信心便也对要员起了作用。假如有丁点儿的动摇，羞怯或遮掩的痕迹出现在海伦本人身上，事情便肯定输掉；但岂止没有任何遮掩和羞怯的痕迹。相反，她还单纯地、天真无邪地向她的亲密朋友（这也就是告诉了全彼得堡）讲述，亲王和要员均已向她求婚，她则爱他们两人，怕任何一个悲伤。\\n\\n 传闻瞬间传遍彼得堡，但不是海伦要同丈夫分手的传闻（如果流传这样的传闻，则会群起反对这种违背法律的意图），而是不幸的招人爱怜的海伦陷入两难境地，到底嫁给两人中的谁。问题如今已不是这有多大的可能，而是嫁给哪一方更为有利，宫廷又是如何看待。确有一些执迷不悟之人，他们无法上升到问题的高度，在这一意图里看到对婚姻圣礼的亵渎，但这样的人很少，并且他们缄口不言；大多数则对降临于海伦的幸福，对哪一选择更好感到兴趣。至于丈夫在世便另外嫁人是好是坏，则不置一辞，因为这一问题，显然，对于比你我（如常所说）更聪明的人而言，已经解决，拘泥于问题解决是否正确，意味着冒险去暴露自己的愚蠢和不善于在上流社会周旋的弱点。\\n\\n 只有那年夏天来彼得堡看儿子的玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜·阿赫罗西莫娃敢于直率说出与众相反的意见。在舞会与海伦相遇，玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜把她拦在舞厅中央，在周围一片沉默中，粗声粗声地对她说：\\n\\n “你们这儿，老婆开始离开丈夫嫁人了。你大概以为这是你想出的新花样吧？早有人占先了，婆娘。这点子已经老早就想出来了。凡是……都是这样干的。”说罢这些话，玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜，摆出一贯的威严姿势，卷起，宽大的袖口，严厉地扫视了一圈，然后穿堂而过。\\n\\n 至于玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜，彼得堡的人虽然也怕她，却当她是个可笑的人，因此，只注意到了她说话中用的那个粗暴字眼，彼此悄悄地重复它，认为这字眼里包含了全部谈话的精华。\\n\\n 近来特别经常说过就忘的瓦西里公爵，把同样的话重复一百次，每次碰巧见到自己的女儿，他都要说：\\n\\n “Héléne，J\u0027ai　un　mot　á　vous　dire，”他对她说，同时领她到一边去，朝下拽她的手。“J\u0027ai　eu　vent　de　certains　projets　relatifs　à…Vous　savez．Eh　bien，ma　chère　enfant，vous　savez　que　mon　coeur　de　père　se　rèjouit　de　vous　savoir…Vous　avez　tant　souffert…Mais，chère　enfant…ne　consultez　que　votre　coeur．C\u0027est　tout　ce　que　je　vous　dis．”①掩藏着总是相同的激动表情，他的面颊挨一挨女儿的面颊，便走开了。\\n\\n 永远保持绝顶聪明的人名声的比利宾，是海伦无私的朋友，是贵妇人府邸常客中的一位，是绝不会扮演钟情角色的男朋友之一，这个比利宾有次在　petit　comité②对自己的朋友海伦说出了对整个事情的看法。\\n\\n “Ecoutez，Bilibine”（海伦对比利宾这样的朋友总是称呼姓，而不叫名字），她用戴着戒指的白皙的手碰了碰他燕尾服的袖管。“Dites　moi　comme　vous　diriez　à　une　soeur，que　dois－je　faire？Lequel　des　deux？”③ \\n\\n ①法语：海伦，我该同你谈谈。听说你有些打算，是关于……你知道的。呶，我亲爱的孩子，你知道，你父亲心里总是高兴的，因为你…你吃了那么多的苦…但亲爱的孩子……照你的心的指示去作。这就是我全部的忠告。\\n\\n ②法语：亲密的小圈子。\\n\\n ③法语：听我说，比利宾：像告诉姐姐一样告诉我怎么办。挑选两人中的哪一位？\\n\\n “Vous　ne　me　prenez　pas　en　pacnlox，vous　savez，”他说。“Comme　véritable　ami　jai　pensé　et　repensé　a　vorte　affairee．Voyez　vous　épousez　le　prince（这是一位年轻人），”他弯曲一根指头，“Vous　perdez　pour　toujours　la　chance　d\u0027épouser　l\u0027autre，et　puis　vous　mécontentez　la　cour．（Comme　vous　savez，il　y　a　une　espèce　de　parenté）．Mais　si　vous　éposez　le　vieux　comte，vous　faites　le　bonBheur　de　ses　der　niers　jours，et　puis　comme　veuve　du　grand…le　prince　ne　fait　plus　de　mésalliance　en　vous　epousant．”①比利宾这才放松了额头上皱起的皮肤。\\n\\n “Voilá　un　véritable　ami！”海伦容光焕发，再一次用手碰了碰比利宾的衣袖。“Mais　c\u0027est　que　jaime　l\u0027un　et　l\u0027autre，je　ne　voudrais　pas　leur　faire　de　chagrin．Je　donnerais　ma　vie　pour　leur　bonheur　à　tous　deux．”②她说。 \\n\\n ①您的问题并不使我觉得突然，您知道。作为真正的朋友，您的事情我考虑过很久。您瞧，如果嫁给亲王，您将绝无可能成为另一人的妻子，此外，宫廷也会不满。（您知道，谱系搞乱了。）如果嫁给老伯爵，您就是他晚年的幸福，然后……亲王娶显贵的遗孀就不有失身份了。\\n\\n ②这才是真正的朋友！可是我爱他又爱他，不愿使任何一个伤心。为他俩人的幸福我甘愿牺牲生命。\\n\\n “Une　maitresse－femme！Voila　ce　qui　s\u0027appelle　poser　carrément　la　question．Elle　voudrait　epouser　tous　les　à　la　fois．”①比利宾心里想。\\n\\n “请说说您丈夫将会怎样看待这件事情？”他说，由于自己的名声牢不可破，不怕这样天真的问题会贬低自己。“他会同意吗？”\\n\\n “Ah！il　m\u0027aime　tant！”海伦说，不知为何她觉得皮埃尔也爱她。“Il　fera　tout　pour　moi．”②\\n\\n 比利宾收紧头皮，以便发表想好了的mot③。\\n\\n “Même　le　divorce．”④他说。海伦笑了。 \\n\\n ①好厉害的女人！这才叫做坚定地摆出问题。她想同时作所有三个人的妻子。\\n\\n ②啊！他多么爱我！他为我准备做任何事情。\\n\\n ③俏皮话。\\n\\n ④连离婚也在内。\\n\\n 公爵夫人以这些她认为无法驳倒的论据武装起来，一大早，为了要单独和女儿见面，就出发去女儿的家。\\n\\n 听完母亲的反对意见后，海伦温和地调皮地微微一笑。\\n\\n “那可是写得干脆呵：谁要是娶离了婚的妻子……”老公爵夫人说。\\n\\n “Ah，maman，ne　dites　pas　de　bétises．Vous　ne　comprenez　rien．Dans　ma　position　j\u0027ai　des　deBvoirs．”①海伦把她的话从俄语译为法语说，她用俄语总好像说不清她的事。\\n\\n “可是，我的伙伴……”\\n\\n “Ah，maman，comment　est－ce　que　vous　ne　comprenez　pas　que　le　saint　père，qui　a　le　droit　de　donner　des　dispenses……”②\\n\\n 这时，就食于海伦门下的一位夫人的女伴前来通报，说殿下在客厅求见。\\n\\n “Non，dites－lui　que　je　ne　veux　pas　le　voir，que　je　suis　furieuse　contre　lui，parce　qu\u0027il　m\u0027a　manqué　parole．”③\\n\\n “Comtesse，　á　tout　péché　misercorde．”④进来的长脸长鼻子的金发年轻人说。 \\n\\n ①啊，妈咪，别说蠢话。您什么也不懂。我所处的地位有我应尽的义务。\\n\\n ②啊，妈咪，您怎么不懂，神父有权宽恕……\\n\\n ③不，对他说，我不想见他，他气死我了，因为他不信守诺言。\\n\\n ④伯爵夫人，一切罪过都应宽恕。\\n\\n “不，她是对的，”老公爵夫人想。一切信念在殿下出现时被扫荡无遗。“她是对的；我们在一去不复返的青春时代怎么就不懂得这些呢？而这是多么简单啊。”老公爵夫人想着坐上了马车。\\n\\n 八月初，海伦的事情完全确定了，她给丈夫（照她想来，那是非常爱她的丈夫）写了一封信，通知他关于自己要嫁给某某的打算，并告诉他她已信奉了唯一真诚的宗教，同时，她请他履行送信人转告他的必须的离婚手续。\\n\\n “Sur　ce　je　prie　Dieu，mon　ami，de　vous　avoir　sous　sa　sainte　et　puisante　garde．Votre　amie　Hélène．”① \\n\\n ①如此，我祈祷上帝，愿您，我的朋友，受到神圣而有力的保佑。您的朋友海伦。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3530.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
