{"id":41226,"no":251,"title":"Book 11 Chapter 27","content":"THE PROCESS of the absorption of the French into Moscow in a widening circle in all directions did not, till the evening of the 2nd of September, reach the quarter of the town in which Pierre was staying. After the two last days spent in solitude and exceptional conditions, Pierre was in a condition approaching madness. One haunting idea had complete possession of him. He could not have told how or when it had come to him, but that idea had now such complete possession of him that he remembered nothing in the past, and understood nothing in the present; and everything he saw and heard seemed passing in a dream. Pierre had left his own house simply to escape from the complicated tangle woven about him by the demands of daily life, which in his condition at that time he was incapable of unravelling. He had gone to Osip Alexyevitch\u0027s house on the pretext of sorting out the books and papers of the deceased. Simply he was in search of a quiet home of rest from the storm of life, and his memories of Osip Alexyevitch were connected in his soul with a whole world of calm, solemn, and eternal ideals, in every way the reverse of the tangled whirl of agitation into which he felt himself being drawn. He was in search of a quiet refuge, and he certainly found it in Osip Alexyevitch\u0027s study. When, in the deathlike stillness of the study, he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing-table of his deceased friend, there passed in calm and significant succession before his mental vision the impressions of the last few days, especially of the battle of Borodino, and of that overwhelming sense of his own pettiness and falsity in comparison with the truth and simplicity and force of that class of men, who were mentally referred to by him as “they.” When Gerasim roused him from his reverie, the idea occurred to Pierre that he would take part in the defence of Moscow by the people, which was, he knew, expected. And with that object he had asked Gerasim to get him a peasant\u0027s coat and a pistol, and had told him that he intended to conceal his name, and to remain in Osip Alexyevitch\u0027s house. Then during the first day of solitude and idleness (Pierre tried several times in vain to fix his attention on the masonic manuscripts) there rose several times vaguely to his mind the idea that had occurred to him in the past of the cabalistic significance of his name in connection with the name of Bonaparte. But the idea that he, l\u0027russe Besuhof, was destined to put an end to the power of the Beast, had as yet only come to him as one of those dreams that flit idly through the brain, leaving no trace behind. When after buying the peasant\u0027s coat, simply with the object of taking part in the defence of Moscow by the people, Pierre had met the Rostovs, and Natasha said to him, “You are staying? Ah, how splendid that is!” the idea had flashed into his mind that it really might be splendid, even if they did take Moscow, for him to remain, and to do what had been fore-told for him to do. Next day with the simple aim of not sparing himself and not doing less than they would do, he had gone out to the Three Hills barrier. But when he came back, convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he suddenly felt that what had only occurred to him before as a possibility had now become something necessary and inevitable. He must remain in Moscow, concealing his name, must meet Napoleon, and kill him, so as either to perish or to put an end to the misery of all Europe, which was in Pierre\u0027s opinion entirely due to Napoleon alone. Pierre knew all the details of the German student\u0027s attempt on Napoleon\u0027s life at Vienna in 1809, and knew that that student had been shot. And the danger to which he would be exposing his own life in carrying out his design excited him even more violently. Two equally powerful feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to his design. The first was the craving for sacrifice and suffering through the sense of the common calamity, the feeling that had impelled him to go to Mozhaisk on the 25th, and to place himself in the very thick of the battle, and now to run away from his own house, to give up his accustomed luxury and comfort, to sleep without undressing on a hard sofa, and to eat the same food as Gerasim. The other was that vague and exclusively Russian feeling of contempt for everything conventional, artificial, human, for everything that is regarded by the majority of men as the highest good in the world. Pierre had for the first time experienced that strange and fascinating feeling in the Slobodsky palace, when he suddenly felt that wealth and power and life, all that men build up and guard with such effort, is only worth anything through the joy with which it can all be cast away. It was the same feeling that impels the volunteer-recruit to drink up his last farthing, the drunken man to smash looking-glasses and window-panes for no apparent cause, though he knows it will cost him his little all; the feeling through which a man in doing things, vulgarly speaking, senseless, as it were, proves his personal force and power, by manifesting the presence of a higher standard of judging life, outside mere human limitations. Ever since the day when Pierre first experienced this feeling in the Slobodsky palace, he had been continually under the influence of it, but it was only now that it found full satisfaction. Moreover at the present moment Pierre was supported in his design, and prevented from abandoning it, by the steps he had already taken in that direction. His flight from his own house, and his disguise, and his pistol, and his statement to the Rostovs that he should remain in Moscow,—all would have been devoid of meaning, would have been indeed absurd and laughable (a point to which Pierre was sensitive) if after all that he had simply gone out of Moscow like other people. Pierre\u0027s physical state, as is always the case, corresponded with his moral condition. The coarse fare to which he was unused, the vodka he drank during those days, the lack of wine and cigars, his dirty, unchanged linen, and two half-sleepless nights, spent on a short sofa without bedding, all reduced Pierre to a state of nervous irritability bordering on madness. It was two o\u0027clock in the afternoon. The French had already entered Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting, he only brooded over his enterprise, going over all the minutest details of it. In his dreams Pierre never clearly pictured the very act of striking the blow, nor the death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and mournful enjoyment dwelt on his own end and his heroic fortitude. “Yes, one man for all, I must act or perish!” he thought. “Yes, I will approach … and then all at once … with a pistol or a dagger!” thought Pierre. “But that doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s not I but the Hand of Providence punishes you.… I shall say” (Pierre pondered over the words he would utter as he killed Napoleon). “Well, take me, execute me!” Pierre would murmur to himself, bowing his head with a sad but firm expression on his face. While Pierre was standing in the middle of the room, musing in this fashion, the door of the study opened, and Makar Alexyevitch—always hitherto so timid—appeared in the doorway, completely transformed. His dressing-gown was hanging open. His face was red and distorted. He was unmistakably drunk. On seeing Pierre he was for the first minute disconcerted, but observing discomfiture in Pierre\u0027s face too, he was at once emboldened by it; and with his thin, tottering legs walked into the middle of the room. “They have grown fearful,” he said, in a husky and confidential voice. “I say: I will not surrender, I say … eh, sir?” He paused and suddenly catching sight of the pistol on the table, snatched it with surprising rapidity and ran out into the corridor. Gerasim and the porter, who had followed Makar Alexyevitch, stopped him in the vestibule, and tried to get the pistol away from him. Pierre coming out of the study looked with repugnance and compassion at the half-insane old man. Makar Alexyevitch, frowning with effort, succeeded in keeping the pistol, and was shouting in a husky voice, evidently imagining some heroic scene. “To arms! Board them! You shan\u0027t get it!” he was shouting. “Give over, please, give over. Do me the favour, sir, please be quiet. There now, if you please, sir, …” Gerasim was saying, cautiously trying to steer Makar Alexyevitch by his elbows towards the door. “Who are you? Bonaparte!…” yelled Makar Alexyevitch. “That\u0027s not the thing, sir. You come into your room and rest a little. Let me have the pistol now.” “Away, base slave! Don\u0027t touch me! Do you see?” screamed Makar Alexyevitch, brandishing the pistol. “Run them down!” “Take hold!” Gerasim whispered to the porter. They seized Makar Alexyevitch by the arms and dragged him towards the door. The vestibule was filled with the unseemly sounds of scuffling and drunken, husky gasping. Suddenly a new sound, a shrill, feminine shriek, was heard from the porch, and the cook ran into the vestibule. “They! Merciful heavens! … My goodness, here they are! Four of them, horsemen!” she screamed. Gerasim and the porter let Makar Alexyevitch go, and in the hush that followed in the corridor they could distinctly hear several hands knocking at the front door. 皮埃尔离群索居，异乎寻常地度过昨日前两天之后，陷入近乎精神错乱的状态。他的整个身心由一种解不开的思绪支配着。他本人并不知道，这种思绪在何时开始和怎样支配他，但这一思绪牢牢缠住他，以至他丝毫不记得过去，丝毫不明白现在；而他的所见所闻有如梦境。 皮埃尔离开自己的家，仅仅是回避纷繁的人生的苛求，这一团乱麻缠住他，在他当时的情况下又无力将它解开。他藉口清理死者的书籍和文件而到约瑟夫·阿列克谢耶维奇的府上去，仅仅是为摆脱人生的困扰而寻找慰藉，并且，回忆起约瑟夫·阿列克谢耶维奇，就会同一个充满永恒、宁静、庄严思想的世界联系起来，这些思想与他感到自己被缠绕的令人不安的那团乱麻，是截然不同的。他寻求一个静静的庇护所，在约瑟夫·阿列克谢耶维奇的书斋里真的找到了。当他在书斋死一般的沉寂里，用臂肘支撑身体靠着尘封的死者的写字台坐着时，脑子里平静地、意味深长地闪现出一幕接一幕的近日的回忆，尤其是波罗底诺战役的回忆，尤其是他已铭刻在心的名为·他·们的那一类人，与他们的真理、纯朴和实力相比，他无可奈何地感到自己的渺小的虚假。当格拉西姆把他从沉思中唤醒时，他想起了他要去参加预定的——如他所知的——民众保卫莫斯科的战斗。为此目的，他请求格拉西姆给他搞一件农夫穿的长褂子和一支手枪，并向他显露自己要隐姓埋名留在约瑟夫·阿列克谢耶维奇家里的意图。随后，在他孤独地、无所事事地度过的第一天中（皮埃尔几次想集中注意力于共济会的手抄本，但都未能做到），他先前想过的关于他的名字与波拿巴的名字相关联的神秘意义，不止一次模糊地又让他感觉到了。不过，关于他l\u0027Russe　Besuhof①，命定要去取消野兽的权力的想法，只是他心驰神往的、来无踪去无影的幻想之一。 ①俄国人别祖霍夫。 第二天，他怀着一个念头，那就是不惜牺牲自己，绝不落后于他们地走出三山关。但当他回到家里后，确信人们不会保卫莫斯科时，突然感到，以前只认为有可能命定他去干的事，现在成了必然不可避免的事了。他应该隐姓埋名，留在莫斯科，会见拿破仑，杀死他，从而结束照他看来是由拿破仑一人造成的全欧的这场灾难，不成功便成仁。 一八○九年，一名德国学生在维也纳刺杀拿破仑的详情，皮埃尔是知道的，他也知道这名学生被枪毙了。但他在为执行自己的计划所冒的生命危险，却使他情绪更加高涨。 有两种同样强烈的感情难以抗阻地促使皮埃尔去实现他的计划。第一种，是意识到全民灾难后，感到有必要作出牺牲和受苦受难，出于这一种感情，他二十五日去了莫扎伊斯克，投身于战斗最激烈的地方，而现在他又离开自己的家，抛弃习惯了的奢侈而舒适的生活，在硬沙发上和衣卧着，并吃着与格拉西姆相同的食品；第二种，是不可捉摸的非俄国人不会有的感情：蔑视一切虚伪的，矫揉造作的人为的东西，以及所有被多数人认为是世界上最高福祉的东西。皮埃尔是在斯洛博达宫，第一次体会到这一奇怪的富有魅力的感情，当时，他突然感到，无论财富、权力，还是生命——所有人们辛劳地获得和爱护的东西，所有这一切，如果有任何价值的话，仅仅是为了享受一下而随即可以把它抛弃的欢乐罢了。 使一个志愿兵喝光最后一个戈比，使一个喝醉酒的人毫无道理地砸碎镜子和玻璃，而他不是不知道这将赔光他所有的金钱的，就是那种感情；使一个人在做（在坏的意义上的）疯狂的事时，仿佛在尝试他个人的权力和力量。同时声称有一种超于人世之外的、作为生活的最高主宰意识，就是那种感情。 从皮埃尔在斯洛博达宫初次体会到这种感情的那天起，他就不断地受其影响，但只是现在才得到充分的满足。此外，在这一时刻使皮埃尔非实现其意图不可，并使其不能舍而弃之，是他在此途径上已经做了的事情。他的弃家而逃，他的车夫大褂，他的手枪，他向罗斯托夫家声明他要留在莫斯科，——他做了这一切以后，如果仍像其他人那样离开莫斯科，那末，这一切不仅失去意义，而且会遭到蔑视，显得可笑（他对此是敏感的）。 像通常会有的情况那样，皮埃尔的身体状况与心理状态是吻合的。吃不惯的粗粝的食物，他这几天喝的伏特加，没有葡萄酒和雪茄烟，脏兮兮的没换洗的内衣，没有床而在短沙发度过的半失眠的两个夜晚，这一切都使皮埃尔处于亢奋的近乎疯狂的状态。 已经是下午一点过了。法军已开进莫斯科。皮埃尔也知道了，他未采取行动，却只是考虑他要做的这件事并把未来的行动的细微情节都想到了。皮埃尔在沉思遐想时，对刺杀过程和拿破仑之死，倒未作出生动的设想，但对自己的慷慨赴死，对自己的英勇气概想象得异常鲜明，并充满忧郁的自我欣赏。 “是的，一人为大家，我应该不成功便成仁！”他想。“是的，我就去……然后突然……用手枪还是匕首呢？”皮埃尔想。 “其实，都一样。不是我，而是天帝之手要处死你……我将说（皮埃尔想着在杀死拿破仑时要说的话）。好吧，把我抓起来杀了吧。”皮埃尔继续自言自语，脸上挂着忧郁而坚定的表情，垂着头。 正当皮埃尔站在房子中间如此这般地盘算着的时候，门被推开了，门槛上出现了一改往常羞怯模样的马卡尔·阿列克谢耶维奇。他的外套敞开着。脸色发红而木然。他显然醉了。看见皮埃尔，他一瞬间有点不自在，但看出皮埃尔脸上有些困惑时，立即大着胆子，摇晃着细瘦的双腿走到房子中间来。 “他们胆小了，”他沙哑着嗓子用信任的口吻说，“我说：我不投降，我说……是不是这样，先生？”他沉默了，突然，他看见桌子上的手枪，意外迅速地抓起它就往走廊跑去。 跟在马卡尔·阿列克谢耶维奇身后的格拉西姆和看门人，在过厅里拦住他夺他的枪。皮埃尔也走到走廊里来，怜悯和厌烦地看着这个半疯半醒的老人。马卡尔·阿列克谢耶维奇使劲抓住枪不放，皱着眉头，并用沙哑的嗓子叫喊，看样子好像在幻想什么庄严的事情。 “拿起武器哟！冲啊！胡说，你夺不走！”他喊道。 “够了，行行好，够了。给我们个面子，请放下吧，请吧，老爷……”格拉西姆说，小心地抓住马卡尔·阿列克谢维奇的胳膊，用力向房门口推他。 “你是谁？波拿巴！……”马卡尔·阿列克谢耶维奇叫着。 “这不好，主人家。您请到房间里去，请休息一下，把小手枪给我吧。” “滚，讨厌的奴才！别碰！看见吗？”马卡尔·阿列克谢耶维奇摇晃着手枪喊道。“冲啊！” “抓住他，”格拉西姆对看门人小声说。 他们抓住马卡尔·阿列克谢耶维奇的手，把他拖到门口去。 过厅充满了一片乱糟糟的喧嚣和醉汉嘶哑的喘息声。 突然，另一声刺耳的女人的叫喊，从门廊传了过来，接着，厨娘跑进了客厅。 “他们！我的老天爷！……真的，是他们。四个，骑着马！” 她叫喊着。 格拉西姆和看门人松手放了马卡尔·阿列克谢耶维奇，于是，在沉寂下来的走廊里，清晰地听到几只手敲叩大门的声音。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3549.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
