{"id":41168,"no":193,"title":"Book 10 Chapter 7","content":"AT THE TIME when this was taking place in Petersburg, the French had passed through Smolensk, and were moving closer and closer to Moscow. Napoleon\u0027s historian, Thiers, like others of Napoleon\u0027s historians, tries to justify his hero by maintaining that he was drawn on to the walls of Moscow against his will. He is as right as any historians who seek the explanation of historic events in the will of a man; he is as right as the Russian historians, who assert that Napoleon was lured to Moscow by the skilful strategy of the Russian generals. In this case, apart from the law of “retrospectiveness,” which makes all the past appear a preparation for the subsequent facts, the element of mutual interaction, too, comes in, confusing the whole subject. A good chess-player, who has lost a game, is genuinely convinced that his failure is due to his blunders, and he seeks the blunder at the commencement of the game, forgetting that at every move during the whole game there were similar errors, that not one piece has been played as perfectly as possible. The blunder on which he concentrates his attention attracts his notice simply because his opponent took advantage of it. How much more complex is the game of war, which must be played within certain limits of time, in which there is not one will controlling lifeless toys, in which the whole is the resultant of the innumerable collisions of diverse individual wills!\\n\\n After Smolensk, Napoleon tried to force on a battle beyond Dorogobuzh, at Vyazma, and then at Tsarevo-Zaimishtche. But the Russians could not give battle, owing to innumerable combinations of circumstances, till Borodino, one hundred and twelve versts from Moscow. From Vyazma Napoleon gave instructions for an advance straight upon Moscow.\\n\\n “Moscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the holy city of the peoples of Alexander, Moscow, with its innumerable churches in the form of Chinese pagodas!”\\n\\n This Moscow would not let Napoleon\u0027s imagination rest. On the march from Vyazma to Tsarevo-Zaimishtche Napoleon was riding on his cream-coloured English horse, accompanied by his guards, and sentinels, and pages, and adjutants. The commander of the staff, Berthier, had dropped behind to put questions to a Russian prisoner taken by the cavalry. Accompanied by the interpreter, Lelorme d\u0027Ideville, he galloped after Napoleon, and pulled his horse up with an amused expression.\\n\\n “Well?” said Napoleon.\\n\\n “A Cossack of Platov\u0027s detachment says Platov is effecting a junction with the main army, and that Kutuzov has been appointed commander-in-chief. He is very shrewd and talkative.”\\n\\n Napoleon smiled, and bade them give the Cossack a horse and bring him before him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped off, and within an hour Denisov\u0027s serf Lavrushka, whom his master had left with Rostov, rode up to Napoleon, sitting on a French cavalry saddle, wearing an orderly\u0027s short jacket, and looking sly, tipsy, and mirthful. Napoleon bade him ride at his side and began questioning him.\\n\\n “Are you a Cossack?”\\n\\n “Yes; a Cossack, your honour.”\\n\\n “The Cossack, ignorant in whose company he was, since Napoleon\u0027s plain appearance had nothing to suggest to the Oriental imagination the presence of a monarch, talked with extraordinary familiarity of the incidents of the war,” says Thiers, relating this episode. In reality Lavrushka, who had been drunk the previous evening, and had left his master without dinner, had been thrashed for it, and sent to the village in quest of fowls, where he was tempted on by plunder till he got caught by the French. Lavrushka was one of those coarse, impudent lackeys who have seen a good deal of life, look on it as a duty to do nothing without cunning and trickery, are ready to do any kind of service for their masters, and are particularly keen in scenting out the baser impulses of their superiors, especially on the side of vanity and pettiness. On coming into the presence of Napoleon, whom he easily and confidently recognised, Lavrushka was not in the least taken aback, and only did his utmost to win the favour of his new master.\\n\\n He was very well aware that this was Napoleon, and Napoleon\u0027s presence impressed him no more than Rostov\u0027s or the quartermaster\u0027s with the rod in his hand, because he had nothing of which either the quartermaster or Napoleon could not deprive him.\\n\\n He had repeated all the gossip that was talked among the officers\u0027 servants. Much of it was true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the Russians expected to conquer Bonaparte or not, Lavrushka screwed up his eyes and thought a bit.\\n\\n He saw in the question a sharp piece of cunning, as cunning fellows, like Lavrushka, always do in everything. He frowned and paused a minute.\\n\\n “Well, if it does come to a battle,” he said thoughtfully, “and pretty soon, then yours will win. That\u0027s sure thing. But if now, three days and there\u0027s a battle after that, well then, I say, that same battle will be a long job.” This was translated to Napoleon. “If a battle is fought within three days the French will win it, but if later, God knows what will come of it,” Lelorme d\u0027Ideville put it, smiling. Napoleon did not smile, though he was evidently in high good humour, and told him to repeat the words.\\n\\n Lavrushka noticed that, and to entertain him further, said, pretending not to know who he was:\\n\\n “We know, you have got your Bonaparte; he has conquered every one in the world, ay, but with us it will be a different story …” himself hardly aware how and why this bit of bragging patriotism slipped out. The interpreter translated these words without the conclusion; and Bonaparte smiled. “The young Cossack brought a smile on to the lips of his august companion,” says Thiers. After a few paces in silence, Napoleon turned to Berthier, and said he should like to try the effect “sur cet enfant du Don” of learning that the man with whom he was speaking was the Emperor himself, the very Emperor who had carved his immortally victorious name on the Pyramids. The fact was communicated. Lavrushka—discerning that this was done to test him, and that Napoleon expected him to be panic-stricken—tried to gratify his new masters by promptly affecting to be astounded, struck dumb; he opened round eyes, and made the sort of face usual with him when he was being led off to be thrashed. “Hardly,” says Thiers, “had Napoleon\u0027s interpreter spoken, than the Cossack was struck dumb with amazement; he did not utter another word, and walked with his eyes constantly fixed on the great conqueror, whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the East. All his loquacity suddenly vanished, and was replaced by a na?ve and silent awe. Napoleon made the Cossack a present, and ordered him to be set at liberty like un oiseau qu\u0027on rend aux champs qui l\u0027ont vu na?tre.”\\n\\n Napoleon rode on, dreaming of that Moscow that filled his imagination, while the bird returning to the fields that had seen him born, galloped back to the outposts, inventing the tale he would tell his comrades. What had really happened he did not care to relate, simply because it seemed to him not worth telling. He rode back to the Cossacks, inquired where was his regiment, now forming part of Platov\u0027s detachment; and towards evening found his master, Nikolay Rostov, encamped at Yankovo. Rostov was just mounting his horse to ride through the villages near with Ilyin. He gave Lavrushka another horse and took him with them.\\n\\n 继斯摩棱斯克之后，拿破仑先在多罗戈布日以西的维亚济马附近，然后又在察列沃—扎伊米希附近谋求会战，但结果呢，由于情势的无数次冲突，在到达波罗金罗，离莫斯科只剩一百二十俄里处之前，俄军仍不交战。拿破仑从维亚济马下令，直接进军莫斯科。\\n\\n Moscou，la　capitale　asiatique　de　ce　grand　emBpire，la　ville　sacrée　des　peuples　d\u0027Alexandre，Moscou　avec　ses　innombrables　églises　en　forme　de　pagodes　chinoises．①这个莫斯科不让拿破仑的神思安静。拿破仑骑一匹浅栗色的截尾快马，由近卫兵、警卫、少年侍从和副官陪同，从维亚济马到察列沃—扎依米希。参谋长贝蒂埃留下来审问被骑兵抓到的俄军俘虏。他在翻译官Lelorme　d\u0027Ideville（勒洛涅·狄德维勒）的陪同下，纵马追上拿破仑，满脸高兴地勒住了马头。 \\n\\n ①莫斯科，这庞大帝国的亚洲首都，亚历山大臣民的神圣的城市，莫斯科有数不尽的中国塔顶样式的教堂。\\n\\n “Un　cosaque　de　Platow（一个普拉托夫的哥萨克）说，普拉托夫军团正同主力大军会合，库图佐夫就任总司令。Très　in－telligent　et　bavard（他聪明，不过是个饶舌的人）。\\n\\n 拿破仑微微一笑，他吩咐拨一匹马给哥萨克，立即带他来见。他要亲自同他谈谈。几个副官策马前去，一个小时后，杰尼索夫出让给罗斯托夫的农奴拉夫鲁什卡，穿着勤务兵的短上衣，骑在法国骑兵的马上，带着一张狡黠、含有醉意、快活的面孔来见拿破仑。拿破仑吩咐他和自己并辔而行开始问他。\\n\\n “您是哥萨克？”\\n\\n “哥萨克，大人。”\\n\\n “Le　cosaque　ignorant　la　compagnie　dans　laquelle　il　se　trouvait　car　la　simplicité　de　Napoléon　n\u0027avait　rien　qui　put　ré　véler　a　une　imagination　orientale　la　présence　d\u0027un　souverain，s\u0027entretint　avec　la　plus　extreme　familiarité　des　affaires　de　la　guerre　actuelle．”①梯也尔叙述这一情节说。的确，拉夫鲁什卡头天晚上喝醉了，没给主人准备好晚餐，挨了鞭打后被派到乡间去买鸡，在那里醉心于抢劫而被法军俘获。拉夫鲁什卡是那种粗野、无耻、见多识广的奴仆，他们以下流狡猾的手段办事为其天职，他们准备为自己的主人干任何勾当，并且他们狡猾地推测主人的坏心思，尤其是虚荣心和琐碎小事。 \\n\\n ①哥萨克不知道他现在置身于什么人中间，因为拿破仑的简朴丝毫没有给予这个东方人的想象力以发现皇帝在场的可能，所以，他极其自然地讲述当前战争的形势。\\n\\n 他很明白，这就是拿破仑本人，而在拿破仑面前，并不比在罗斯托夫或拿藤条的司务长面前更使他慌张，因为无论是司务长或是拿破仑，都不能夺去他任何东西。\\n\\n 他信口说出在勤务兵之间闲谈的一切。其中有些是真实的。但当拿破仑问他俄国人是怎么想的，他们能否战胜波拿巴时，拉夫鲁什卡眯缝起眼睛，沉思起来。\\n\\n 他在这句话里看出了微妙的狡黠，类似拉夫鲁什卡的人总能在各种事情中看出狡猾的计谋，因而皱紧眉头沉默了一会儿。\\n\\n “是这样的，如果有会战，”他思索地说道，“并且很快的话，那末，这样说就对了。呶，要是再过三天，要是在那天以后，那末，就是说，会战本身会拖下去。”\\n\\n 给拿破仑翻译的话是这样的：Si　la　bataille　est　donnée　avant　trois　jours，les　Francais　la　gagnBeraient，mais　que　si　elle　serait　donnée　plus　tard，Dieu　sait　ce　qui　en　arriverait①，Le　lorme　d\u0027lderBille．（勒洛涅·狄德维勒）微笑着转达了。拿破仑并没有微笑，虽然他心情显然很愉快，并吩咐重说一遍。 \\n\\n ①假如会战在三天前爆发，法国人将赢得会战，如果在三天之后呢，那只有上帝才知道会发生什么情况。\\n\\n “我们知道你们有个波拿巴，他打败了世界上所有的人，但关于我们，情况却不同……”他说，连自己也不知道，说到最后，不知为什么和怎么流露出浮夸的爱国精神来了。翻译官把他的话转述给拿破仑，省掉了结尾，波拿巴于是微笑了。“Le　jeune　cosaque　fit　sourire　son　puisant　inBterlocuteur．”①梯也尔说。拿破仑沉默地走了几步，在马上转身对贝蒂埃说，他想试验一下对这个enfant　du　Don说，他的谈话的对方正是皇帝本人，即是那位把不朽的常胜者的名字书写在埃及金字塔上的皇帝。sur　cet　enfant　du　Don②会产生什么影响，\\n\\n 这番话传达给他了。 \\n\\n ①年轻的哥萨克使自己强大的交谈者微笑起来。\\n\\n ②对这个顿河的孩子。\\n\\n ①拿破仑的翻译官刚把话说完，哥萨克立即惊愕得发呆了，再也说不出一句话来，就这样继续骑马走着，定睛望着征服者，他的名声越过东方草原传到他的耳边。哥萨克的健谈骤然中断，由天真的默默的狂喜所代替。拿破仑赏赐哥萨克，下令给他自由，就像给予小鸟自由，让它飞回家乡的田野一样。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3491.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
