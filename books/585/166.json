{"id":41141,"no":166,"title":"Book 9 Chapter 3","content":"THE RUSSIAN EMPEROR had meanwhile been spending more than a month in Vilna, holding reviews and inspecting man?uvres. Nothing was in readiness for the war, which all were expecting, though it was to prepare for it that the Tsar had come from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The vacillation between all the plans that were proposed and the inability to fix on any one of them, was more marked than ever after the Tsar had been for a month at headquarters. There was a separate commander-in-chief at the head of each of the three armies; but there was no commander with authority over all of them, and the Tsar did not undertake the duties of such a commander-in-chief himself.\\n\\n The longer the Tsar stayed at Vilna, the less ready was the Russian army for the war, which it had grown weary of expecting. Every effort of the men who surrounded the Tsar seemed to be devoted to making their sovereign spend his time pleasantly and forget the impending war.\\n\\n Many balls and fêtes were given by the Polish magnates, by members of the court, and by the Tsar himself; and in the month of June it occurred to one of the Polish generals attached to the Tsar\u0027s staff that all the generals on the staff should give a dinner and a ball to the Tsar. The suggestion was eagerly taken up. The Tsar gave his consent. The generals on the staff subscribed the necessary funds. The lady who was most likely to please the Tsar\u0027s taste was selected as hostess for the ball. Count Bennigsen, who had land in the Vilna province, offered his house in the outskirts for this fête, and the 13th of June was the day fixed for a ball, a dinner, with a regatta and fireworks at Zakreta, Count Bennigsen\u0027s suburban house.\\n\\n On the very day on which Napoleon gave the order to cross the Niemen, and the vanguard of his army crossed the Russian frontier, driving back the Cossacks, Alexander was at the ball given by the generals on his staff at Count Bennigsen\u0027s house.\\n\\n It was a brilliant and festive entertainment. Connoisseurs declared that rarely had so many beauties been gathered together at one place. Countess Bezuhov, who had been among the Russian ladies who had followed the Tsar from Petersburg to Vilna, was at that ball, her heavy, Russian style of beauty—as it is called—overshadowing the more refined Polish ladies. She was much noticed, and the Tsar had deigned to bestow a dance upon her.\\n\\n Boris Drubetskoy, who had left his wife at Moscow, and was living “en gar?on,” as he said, at Vilna, was also at that ball; and although he was not a general on the staff, he had subscribed a large sum to the ball. Boris was now a wealthy man who had risen to high honours. He no longer sought patronage, but was on an equal footing with the most distinguished men of his age. At Vilna he met Ellen, whom he had not seen for a long while. As Ellen was enjoying the good graces of a very important personage indeed, and Boris had so recently been married, they made no allusion to the past, but met as good-natured, old friends.\\n\\n At midnight dancing was still going on. Ellen happening to have no suitable partner had herself proposed a mazurka to Boris. They were the third couple. Boris was looking coldly at Ellen\u0027s splendid bare shoulders, which rose out of her dress of dark gauze and gold, and was talking to her of old acquaintances, and yet though others and himself too were unaware of it, he never for a second ceased observing the Tsar who was in the same room. The Tsar was not dancing; he was standing in the doorway, stopping one person after the other with the gracious words he alone knew how to utter.\\n\\n At the beginning of the mazurka, Boris saw that a general of the staff, Balashov, one of the persons in closest attendance on the Tsar, went up to him, and, regardless of court etiquette, stopped close to him, while he conversed with a Polish lady. After saying a few words to the lady, the Tsar glanced inquiringly at Balashov, and apparently seeing that he was behaving like this only because he had weighty reasons for doing so, he gave the lady a slight nod and turned to Balashov. The Tsar\u0027s countenance betrayed amazement, as soon as Balashov had begun to speak. He took Balashov\u0027s arm and walked across the room with him, unconsciously clearing a space of three yards on each side of him as people hastily drew back. Boris noticed the excited face of Araktcheev as the Tsar walked up the room with Balashov. Araktcheev, looking from under his brows at the Tsar, and sniffing with his red nose, moved forward out of the crowd as though expecting the Tsar to apply to him. (Boris saw that Araktcheev envied Balashov and was displeased at any important news having reached the Tsar not through him.) But the Tsar and Balashov walked out by the door into the lighted garden, without noticing Araktcheev. Araktcheev, holding his sword and looking wrathfully about him, followed twenty paces behind them.\\n\\n Boris went on performing the figures of the mazurka, but he was all the while fretted by wondering what the news could be that Balashov had brought, and in what way he could find it out before other people. In the figure in which he had to choose a lady, he whispered to Ellen that he wanted to choose Countess Pototsky, who had, he thought, gone out on to the balcony, and gliding over the parquet, he flew to the door that opened into the garden, and seeing the Tsar and Balashov coming into the verandah, he stood still there. The Tsar and Balashov moved towards the door. Boris, with a show of haste, as though he had not time to move away, squeezed respectfully up to the doorpost and bowed his head. The Tsar in the tone of a man resenting a personal insult was saying:\\n\\n “To enter Russia with no declaration of war! I will consent to conciliation only when not a single enemy under arms is left in my country,” he said.\\n\\n It seemed to Boris that the Tsar liked uttering these words: he was pleased with the form in which he had expressed his feelings, but displeased at Boris overhearing them.\\n\\n “Let nobody know of it!” the Tsar added, frowning.\\n\\n Boris saw that this was aimed at him, and closing his eyes, inclined his head a little. The Tsar went back to the ballroom, and remained there another half hour.\\n\\n Boris was the first person to learn the news that the French troops had crossed the Niemen; and, thanks to that fact, was enabled to prove to various persons of great consequence, that much that was hidden from others was commonly known to him, and was thereby enabled to rise even higher than before in the opinion of those persons.\\n\\n The astounding news of the French having crossed the Niemen seemed particularly unexpected from coming after a month\u0027s uninterrupted expectation of it, and arriving at a ball! At the first moment of amazement and resentment on getting the news, Alexander hit on the declaration that has since become famous—a declaration which pleased him and fully expressed his feelings. On returning home after the ball at two o\u0027clock in the night, the Tsar sent for his secretary, Shishkov, and told him to write a decree to the army and a rescript to Field-Marshal Prince Saltykov; and he insisted on the words being inserted that he would never make peace as long as one Frenchman under arms remained in Russia.\\n\\n The next day the following letter was written to Napoleon:\\n\\n MONSIEUR MON FRèRE,—I learnt yesterday that in spite of the loyalty with which I have kept my engagements with your Majesty, your troops have crossed the frontiers of Russia, and I have this moment received from Petersburg the note in which Count Lauriston informs me as cause of this invasion that your majesty considers us to be in hostile relations ever since Prince Kurakin asked for his passport. The causes on which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to give these passports would never have led me to suppose that the action of my ambassador could serve as a ground for invasion. And, indeed, he received no authorisation from me in his action, as has been made known by him; and as soon as I heard of it I immediately expressed my displeasure to Prince Kurakin, commanding him to perform the duties entrusted to him as before. If your majesty is not inclined to shed the blood of your subjects for such a misunderstanding, and if you consent to withdraw your troops from Russian territory, I will pass over the whole incident unnoticed, and agreement between us will be possible. In the opposite case, I shall be forced to repel an invasion which has been in no way provoked on my side. Your Majesty has it in your power to preserve humanity from the disasters of another war.—I am, etc.,\\n\\n 皇帝在维尔纳住得越久，人们对应付等待得厌烦的战争的准备却越少。原来，皇帝周围的人所作的一切只是要皇帝过得快活，使他忘掉面临的战争。\\n\\n 波兰的达官贵人、朝臣以及皇帝本人举行了许多大型舞会和庆祝活动后，六月里，皇帝的一位波兰侍从武官想起要代表皇帝的侍从武官（以侍从武官的名义）为皇帝举办宴会和舞会。这个提议被大家愉快地采纳了，皇帝也表示同意。侍从武官们按认捐名单筹集所需经费。一位最受皇帝青睐的女人被邀请来做舞会的女主持人。伯尼格森伯爵，一位维尔纳省的地主，为这次庆祝会提供了他自己郊外的别墅，这样，六月十三日，在伯尼格森伯爵的郊外别野扎克列特举行舞会、宴会、划船赛和焰火晚会的事被定下来。\\n\\n 就在同一天，拿破仑发出横渡涅曼河的命令，他的先头部队逼退哥萨克，越过俄罗斯边界，而亚历山大却在伯尼格森的别野他的侍从武官为他举行的大型舞会上欢度那个夜晚。\\n\\n 那真是一个快乐而辉煌的节日；内行们说在一个地方这么多美人聚在一起是少见的。别祖霍娃伯爵夫人是随皇帝从彼得堡到维尔纳来的俄罗斯贵妇之一，她也参加了这个舞会，她以自己被誉为俄罗斯美的庞大身躯使体态轻盈的波兰夫人们黯然失色，她很出众，连皇帝也与她跳了一曲。\\n\\n 鲍里斯·德鲁别茨科伊，一位把妻子丢在莫斯科而自称单身汉（en　garcon）的人，也参加了这次舞会，他虽然不是侍从武官，却也为舞会认捐了一大笔钱。现在鲍里斯早已成为一位显赫的富翁，他已用不着寻求庇护，而是与那些高贵的同辈们平起平坐了。\\n\\n 午夜十二时，人们还在跳舞。海伦没有合适的舞伴，就自己邀请鲍里斯跳了一曲玛祖尔卡舞。他们选第三对舞伴。鲍里斯冷漠地望着海伦那从绣金黑沙长衫露出的明艳的裸肩，议论着往日的熟人，同时，无论是他自己还是别人都没留意到，他没有一秒钟不在观察同一大厅里的皇帝。皇帝没有跳舞，他站在门边，不时叫住一些跳舞的人，对他们谈只有他一个人才会讲的亲切的话语。\\n\\n 玛祖尔卡舞刚开始时，鲍里斯看见皇帝的亲信之一，侍从武官巴拉瑟夫走向皇帝，他违背宫廷规矩，在正与一位波兰贵妇人谈话的皇帝近旁停下来。皇帝与那位贵妇人说了几句话，疑惑地看了他一眼，看来他明白巴拉瑟夫那样做只可能是有重要原因。他轻轻地向那贵妇人点点头，便转向巴拉瑟夫。巴拉瑟夫刚开始说话，皇帝脸上就露出吃惊的神情。他挽起巴拉瑟夫的手，与他一起穿过大厅，两旁的人不由地为他们让出一条约三俄丈宽的路来。鲍里斯发现，当皇帝同巴拉瑟夫经过时，阿拉克切耶夫脸上露出不安的神情。阿拉克切耶夫皱着眉望着皇帝，酒糟鼻子不时发出呼哧声，从人群中挤出来，仿佛料到皇帝会注意到他。鲍里斯明白了，阿拉克切耶夫嫉妒巴拉瑟夫，不满意那个虽然很重要的消息不经过他就奏知了皇帝。\\n\\n 但是皇帝挽着巴拉瑟夫没有注意阿拉克切耶夫，他们穿过大厅出口走进了灯火辉煌的花园。阿拉克切耶夫手扶佩刀，忿忿地张望着自己的周围，在他们身后跟着走了二十多步。而鲍里斯却继续跳了几轮玛祖尔卡舞，但心里却不住苦苦思索巴拉瑟夫带来的是什么消息，他是用什么方式比别人先探听到这消息的。\\n\\n 在应该他挑选舞伴的那一局，他低声对海伦说，他想请波托茨卡娅小姐跳一曲，这位小姐好像去了阳台，而后他的脚滑过镶木地板，向通往花园的门口跑去，他看见皇帝和巴拉瑟夫走向露台，就站了一会儿。皇帝和巴拉瑟夫一起向门口来。鲍里斯仿佛来不及躲避似的，慌忙恭恭敬敬地紧靠门框低下头来。\\n\\n 皇帝怀着一个身受侮辱的人的激动不安的心情，说出下面的话：\\n\\n “不宣而战就进入俄罗斯！只要还有一个武装的敌人留在我的国土上，我就决不讲和。”他说。正如鲍里斯所感觉的那样，皇帝说出这些话很痛快：他很满意自己表达思想的方式，但是却不满意鲍里斯听到他的话。\\n\\n “不要让任何人知道！”皇帝皱着眉头补充道。鲍里斯明白这是对他说的，于是，就闭上眼睛，微微低下头。皇帝又走进大厅，在舞会上又逗留了近半小时。\\n\\n 鲍里斯第一个了解到法国军队渡过涅曼河的消息，这样，他就有机会向一些要人炫耀别人不知道而他常知道的许多事情，也正如此，他有机会在这些人的心目中抬高自己。\\n\\n 法国军队横渡涅曼河的意外消息在人们原来预期的时间一个月后传来，且是在舞会上听到就更让人感到意外了！最初，接到消息的皇帝由于气愤和屈辱说出了后来成为名言的那句话，这句话他自己也很喜欢，它充分表达了他的感情。从舞会上回去后，皇帝在凌晨两点钟召见秘书希什科夫，吩咐他给军队写了一道命令，并给大元帅萨尔特科夫下了一道圣谕，他要求在命令中一定要加入“只要还有一个武装的法国人还留在俄罗斯土地上，他就决不讲和”这句话。\\n\\n 第二天，他给拿破仑写了下面这封信。\\n\\n （法文：略）① \\n\\n ①皇帝仁兄大人！虽然对陛下所负的义务，我信守不渝，但昨天我得悉您的军队越过了俄国边境，直到现时我才收到从彼得堡送来的通牒，洛里斯东伯爵在谈到这次进犯，引用通牒的话对我说，自从库拉金公爵申请自己的护照时起，陛下就认为您和我彼此都怀有恶感。巴萨那公爵拒发护照所持的种种理由使我万万想不到，我国大使申请护照这一行动竟成为入侵的借口。实际上，正如那位大使所声明的，我并未授权他提出那个申请；我一得悉这个消息，就立即对库拉金公爵表示了我的不满，命令他照旧履行他的职务。如果陛下不愿为这类误会而让两国人民流血，同意从俄罗斯领土撤出贵国军队，我一定不介意过去所发生的一切，我们之间还是可以和解。否则，对于完全不由我方挑起的进攻，我方将被迫奋起反击。陛下，您仍有可能使人类避免新的战争灾难。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3464.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
