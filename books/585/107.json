{"id":41082,"no":107,"title":"Book 6 Chapter 5","content":"WHILE AWAITING THE ANNOUNCEMENT of his name having been put on the committee, Prince Andrey looked up old acquaintances, especially among those persons whom he knew to be in power, and so able to be of use to him. He experienced now in Petersburg a sensation akin to what he had known on the eve of a battle, when he was fretted by restless curiosity and irresistibly attracted to those higher spheres, where the future was in preparation, that future on which hung the fate of millions. From the angry irritability of the elder generation, from the curiosity of the uninitiated and the reserve of the initiated, from the hurry and anxious absorption of every one, from the multiplicity of committees and commissions—he was learning of new ones every day—he felt that now, in the year 1809, there was in preparation here in Petersburg some vast political contest, and the commander-in-chief in it was a mysterious personage whom he did not know, but imagined to be a man of genius—Speransky. And this movement of reform, of which he knew vaguely, and Speransky, the moving spirit of it, began to interest him so keenly that his proposed reform of the army regulations very soon fell into a subordinate position in his mind. Prince Andrey happened to be most favourably placed for obtaining a good reception in the highest and most various circles of the Petersburg society of that day. The reforming party welcomed him warmly, and sought him out, in the first place, because he had the reputation of being clever and very well read, and secondly because he had already gained the reputation of being a liberal by the emancipation of his serfs. The party of the dissatisfied older generation welcomed him simply as the son of his father, and reckoned upon his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms. The feminine world, society, received him cordially because he was a wealthy match of high rank, and a person almost new, encircled by a halo of romance from his narrow escape from death and the tragic loss of his young wife. Moreover the general verdict of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly changed for the better during the last five years, had grown softer and more manly, that he had lost his old affectation, pride, and sarcastic irony, and had gained the serenity that comes with years. People talked of him, were interested in him, and eager to see him The day after his interview with Count Araktcheev, Prince Andrey was at a soirée at Count Kotchubey\u0027s. He described to the latter his interview with Sila Andreitch. (This was the name by which Kotchubey spoke of Araktcheev with that vague note of jeering in his voice which Prince Andrey had noticed in the anteroom of the minister of war.) “Mon cher, even in this affair you can\u0027t do without Mihail Mihalovitch. He has a hand in everything. I\u0027ll speak to him. He promised to come in the evening…” “But what has Speransky to do with the army regulations?” asked Prince Andrey. Kotchubey shook his head, smiling, as though wondering at Bolkonsky\u0027s simplicity. “We were talking to him about you the other day,” Kotchubey continued; “about your free cultivators…” “Yes, so it was you, prince, who freed your serfs?” said an old gentleman of Catherine\u0027s court, turning disdainfully to Bolkonsky. “The little estate brought me no income as it was,” answered Bolkonsky, trying to minimise what he had done to the old gentleman, to avoid irritating him needlessly. “You are afraid of being late,” said the old gentleman, looking at Kotchubey. “There\u0027s one thing I don\u0027t understand,” pursued the old gentleman. “Who is to till the land if they are set free? It\u0027s easy to pass laws, but hard work to govern. It\u0027s just the same as now; I ask you, count, who will preside over the courts when all have to pass examinations?” “Those who pass the examinations, I suppose,” answered Kotchubey, crossing his legs and looking about him. “Here I have Pryanitchnikov in my department, a capital man, a priceless man, but he is sixty; how is he to go in for examinations?…” “Yes, that\u0027s a difficult question, considering that education is so restricted, but…” Count Kotchubey did not finish his sentence; he got up, and taking Prince Andrey by the arm, went to meet a tall, bald, fair-haired man of forty, who had just come in. He had a large, open forehead, and his long face was of a strange, exceptional whiteness; he wore a blue frock coat and had a cross at his neck and a star on the left side of his breast. It was Speransky. Prince Andrey recognised him at once, and that thrill passed through him that comes at the great moments of one\u0027s life. Whether it was a thrill of respect, of envy, of anticipation, he did not know. Speransky\u0027s whole figure had a peculiar character by which he could be distinguished immediately. Never in any one of the circles in which Prince Andrey had moved had he seen such calm and self-confidence as was manifest in this man\u0027s heavy and ungainly movements. Never in any one had he seen a glance so resolute, and yet so soft, as now in those half-closed and moist-looking eyes; never had he seen such firmness as in that smile that meant nothing. Never had he heard a voice so delicate, smooth, and soft; but what struck him most of all was the tender whiteness of the face, and still more the hands, which were rather broad, but extremely plump, soft, and white. Such whiteness and softness Prince Andrey had seen only in the faces of soldiers who had been a long while in hospital. This was Speransky, the secretary of state, the Tsar\u0027s confidential adviser, who had accompanied him to Erfurt, and there had more than once seen and talked with Napoleon. Speransky\u0027s eyes did not shift from one face to another, as one\u0027s eyes unconsciously do on first coming into a large company, and he was in no hurry to speak. He spoke slowly, with conviction that he would be listened to, and looked only at the person to whom he was speaking. Prince Andrey watched every word and gesture of Speransky\u0027s with peculiar intentness. As is often the case with men, particularly with those who criticise their fellows severely, Prince Andrey on meeting a new person, especially one like Speransky, whom he knew by reputation, had always a hope of finding in him a full perfection of human qualities. Speransky said to Kotchubey that he was sorry that he had not been able to come earlier, because he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that the Tsar had kept him. And this affectation of modesty did not escape Prince Andrey. When Kotchubey mentioned Prince Andrey\u0027s name to him, Speransky slowly transferred his eyes to Bolkonsky, with the same smile on his face, and gazed for a moment at him in silence. “I am very glad to make your acquaintance; I have heard of you, as every one has,” said he. Kotchubey said a few words about the reception Araktcheev had given Bolkonsky. Speransky\u0027s smile broadened. “The chairman of the Committee of Army Regulations is a friend of mine—M. Magnitsky,” he said, articulating fully every word and every syllable, “and, if you wish it, I can make you acquainted with him.” (He paused at the full stop.) “I expect that you would meet with sympathy in him and a desire to assist in anything reasonable.” A circle formed at once round Speransky, and the same old gentleman, who had talked of his clerk, Pryanitchnikov, addressed a question to Speransky. Taking no part in the conversation, Prince Andrey watched every gesture of Speransky—this man, only a little time before an insignificant divinity student, who now held in his hands—those plump white hands—the fate of Russia, as Bolkonsky thought. Prince Andrey was struck by the extraordinarily contemptuous composure with which Speransky answered the old gentleman. He seemed to drop him his condescending words from an immeasurable height above him. When the old gentleman began talking too loud, Speransky smiled and said that he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what the Tsar saw fit to command. After talking for a little while in the general circle, Speransky got up, and going to Prince Andrey, drew him away to the other end of the room. It was evident that he thought it well to interest himself in Bolkonsky. “I have not had time for a word with you, prince, in the engrossing conversation into which I was dragged by that excellent old gentleman,” he said, with a smile of bland contempt, by which he seemed to take for granted that Prince Andrey and himself were at one in recognising the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrey. “I have known you for a long while: first from your action with the serfs, the first instance of the kind among us, an example which one would desire to find many following; and, secondly, from your being one of those kammerherrs who have not considered themselves wronged by the new decree in regard to promotion by court favour, that has provoked so much criticism and censure.” “Yes,” said Prince Andrey, “my father did not care for me to take advantage of that privilege; I began the service from the lower grades.” “Your father, a man of the older generation, is undoubtedly above the level of our contemporaries, who condemn this measure, though it is simply an act of natural justice.” “I imagine there is some basis though even for that condemnation,” said Prince Andrey, trying to resist the influence of Speransky, of which he began to be aware. He disliked agreeing with him in everything; he tried to oppose him. Prince Andrey, who usually spoke so well and so readily, felt a difficulty even in expressing himself as he talked with Speransky. He was too much occupied in observing the personality of the celebrated man. “In the interests of personal ambition perhaps,” Speransky slowly put in his word. “And to some extent in the interests of the state,” said Prince Andrey. “How do you mean?…” said Speransky slowly, dropping his eyes. “I am an admirer of Montesquieu,” said Prince Andrey. “And his theory that the principle of monarchies is honour seems to me incontestable. Certain rights and privileges of the nobility appear to me to be means of maintaining that sentiment.” The smile vanished from Speransky\u0027s white face, and his countenance gained greatly by its absence. Probably Prince Andrey\u0027s idea seemed to him an interesting one. “If you look at the question from that point of view,” he began, pronouncing French with obvious difficulty, and speaking even more deliberately than he had done when speaking Russian, but still with perfect composure. He said that honour, l\u0027honneur, cannot be supported by privileges prejudicial to the working of the government; that honour, l\u0027honneur, is either a negative concept of avoidance of reprehensible actions or a certain source of emulation in obtaining the commendation and rewards in which it finds expression. His arguments were condensed, simple, and clear. “The institution that best maintains that honour, the source of emulation, is an institution akin to the Legion of Honour of the great Emperor Napoleon, which does not detract from but conduces to the successful working of the government service, and not a class or court privilege.” “I do not dispute that, but there is no denying that the court privileges did attain the same object,” said Prince Andrey. “Every courtier thought himself bound to do credit to his position.” “But you did not care to profit by it, prince,” said Speransky, showing with a smile that he wished to conclude with civility an argument embarrassing for his companion. “If you will do me the honour to call on Wednesday, then I shall have seen Magnitsky, and shall have something to tell you that may interest you, and besides I shall have the pleasure of more conversation with you.” Closing his eyes, he bowed, and trying to escape unnoticed, he went out of the drawing-room without saying good-bye, à la fran?aise. 安德烈公爵处于至为有利的地位，他在当时的彼得堡上层社会各界都受到厚意的接待。革新派盛情招待他，应酬他，其一是因为他聪颖过人，学识渊博，著称于世，其二是因为他解放农民，博得自由思想者的名声。怀有不满情绪的老人派，谴责其改革措施，干脆要他这个老博尔孔斯基的儿子表示同情。妇女界和交际界盛情接待他，因为他是个未婚男子，既富有，而且显贵，兼以讹传他已阵亡、妻子身罹惨死，他几乎被人视为享有浪漫史荣耀的新颖人物。此外，所有从前认识他的人，都异口同声地说，在这五年间，他已有好转，性格变温和了，更加老练了，他身上已经没有从前那样的虚假、高傲和讪笑的缺点，现在他身上有一种与岁月俱增的宁静的态度。大家都在谈论他，对他表示关心，并且希望和他会面。 第二天，安德烈公爵拜谒阿拉克切耶夫伯爵后，晚间他到过科丘别伊伯爵家中。他把晋谒西拉·安德烈伊奇的情形讲给科丘别伊伯爵听（科丘别伊流露着安德烈公爵在军政大臣接待室里所察觉的那种含蓄的嘲笑时，也这样称呼阿拉克切耶夫）。 “Mon　cher①，甚至在这件事情上，您也不能不牵涉到米哈伊尔·米哈伊洛维奇（斯佩兰斯基的名字和父称）。C\u0027est　le　grand　faiseur②，我告诉他吧。他答应今天晚上到这里来……” “军事条令与斯佩兰斯基何干？”安德烈公爵问道。 科丘别伊微微一笑，摇摇头，好像他对博尔孔斯基的幼稚感到诧异。 “前几天我和他谈到您了，”科丘别伊继续说，“谈到您的自由农民……” “对，您，公爵解放了您的农民吗？”一个叶卡捷琳娜女皇时代的老人轻蔑地把脸转向博尔孔斯基，说道。 “小领地不会有什么收入。”博尔孔斯基回答，力图在他面前使自己的作为不引人瞩目，省得平白地激怒这个老人。 “Vous　craignez　d\u0027eBtre　en　retard．”③老头瞧着科丘别伊时说。 ①法语：我亲爱的。 ②法语：他是个总管。 ③法语：您害怕赶不上去。 “我想，由那些考试及格的人来当首长。”科丘别伊跷起二郎腿，环顾四周时答道。 “瞧，普里亚尼奇尼科夫在我这里供职，是个极好的人，出类拔萃的人，可是他有六十岁了，难道他也要去参加考试吗？……” “对的，这是棘手的，因为教育还很不普及，但是……”科丘别伊伯爵没有把话说完，就一把抓住安德烈公爵的手，走去迎接进来的人，这个人身材魁梧，谢顶，头发浅黄，莫约四十岁，前额宽大而凸出长方脸，脸色雪白，白得出奇。这个走进来的人身穿蓝色燕尾服，脖子上挂着十字架，左胸前佩戴金星勋章。他就是斯佩兰斯基。安德烈公爵立即就认出他了，他的心颤动了一下，这是在他生命的紧要时刻常有的情形。这是否是敬意，妒嫉，或者是期待——他无从知道。斯佩兰斯基的整个身躯属于特殊的类型，从这种体型一下子就能把他认出来。在安德烈公爵所生活的那个社会里，他没有见过谁有这样宁静而自信的笨拙而迟钝的动作，他没有见过谁的那对半开半阖的有点潮湿的眼睛里会流露出这样坚定而且温和的目光，没有见过谁有这样爽朗的毫无含义的微笑，谁也没有这样平静的低沉的尖细的嗓音，主要是没有这样细嫩的雪白的面孔，尤其是没有那双略嫌宽大而异常肥胖的、柔嫩而白净的手臂。安德烈公爵只是看见那些长期住院的士兵才有这样白皙的柔嫩的面孔。这就是斯佩兰斯基，国务大臣，向国王禀告国情的人，国王在埃尔富特的同行者，在那里他不止一次地觐见国王，和国王畅谈。 斯佩兰斯基没有把目光从一个人身上一下子移到另一个人身上，并不像进入大庭广众中时情不自禁地用视线扫视那样，他也不急忙开口说话。他低声地说，心里相信大家都会听他说下去，他只注视交谈者的面孔。 安德烈公爵特别仔细地观察斯佩兰斯基的每句话和每个动作。就像人们常有的情形那样，特别是像那些对别人严加指摘的人那样，安德烈公爵遇见一个新来的人，尤其是遇见这位他所熟知的大名鼎鼎的斯佩兰斯基时，他总是期待在他身上发现完美的人格。 斯佩兰斯基告诉科丘别伊，说他对未能更早抵达一事深表遗憾，因为在皇宫里给耽搁了。他没有说国王把他耽搁了。安德烈公爵看出了这种矫揉造作的谦逊。当科丘别伊向他喊出安德烈公爵的名字时，斯佩兰斯基仍然面露笑容，把目光慢慢地移到博尔孔斯基身上，他开始沉默地打量他。 “我和您认识，感到很高兴，我也像大家一样，久闻大名。” 他说道。 科丘别伊说了几句有关阿拉克切耶夫接见博尔孔斯基的话。斯佩兰斯基又微微一笑。 “军事条令委员会主任是我的一位好朋友——马格尼茨基先生，”他说，他把每个音节和每个词都说得清清楚楚，“若是您愿意，我可以领您去和他认识一下。（他沉默片刻。）我希望，您能得到他的同情，他愿意促进一切合理的事业。” 斯佩兰斯基周围立即形成了一个小圈子。那个讲他的官吏普里亚尼奇尼科夫的老头子也向斯佩兰斯基提出问题。 安德烈公爵没有参加谈话，他在观察斯佩兰斯基的各种动作，这个人不久以前是个微不足道的学员，而今他的这双又白又肥的手掌握着俄国的命运，博尔孔斯基心里思忖着。斯佩兰斯基怀着蔑视他人的、异乎寻常的冷静的态度回答老人的问话，他这种态度竟使安德烈公爵大为惊讶。他好像从那无可估量的高处对他说了一句宽容的话。当这个老头开始大声说话时，斯佩兰斯基微微一笑，并且说他没法评判国王喜欢的事情是有利，或有弊。 斯佩兰斯基在公共小组中讲了一会儿之后，便站立起来，走到安德烈公爵跟前，把他喊到房间的另一头。看来他认为应当应酬应酬博尔孔斯基。 “这个可敬的老头硬把我拖去参与一次令人兴奋的谈话，公爵，在谈话当中我来不及同您谈谈，”他说道，脸上流露着温和而轻蔑的微笑，仿佛在微笑之中承认，他和安德烈公爵都明白，他甫才与之交谈的那些人都是小人物。这种态度使安德烈公爵心里得到满足。“我是老早就知道您的：其一，是因为您在解决您的农民问题上为我们树立第一个典范，希望有更多的追随者拥护这个典范；其二，是因为您是宫廷高级侍从之一，关于宫廷中的官衔的新指示正引起流言闲语，而宫廷高级侍从们不认为他们自己因此而蒙受屈辱。” “是的，”安德烈公爵说，“我父亲不想要我享有这样的权利，我是从低级官阶开始供职的。” “令尊是老一辈的人，显然比极力谴责这种措施的我们同时代人的地位更高，可是这种措施只是恢复原有的正义而已。” “不过我以为，这种谴责也是有理由的。”安德烈公爵说，他开始感觉到斯佩兰斯基对他产生的影响，他于是力图反对它。他不愿意在各个方面赞同他的意见，他意欲反驳。安德烈公爵平时说得很流畅，善于辞令，现在他和斯佩兰斯基谈话时竟然感到难以表达思想。他对这个著名人士的个性的观察太感兴趣了。 “也许是一种维护个人虚荣的理由。”斯佩兰斯基轻言细语地插了一句话。 “一部分是为了国家。”安德烈公爵说道。 “您指的是什么意思？……”斯佩兰斯基悄悄地垂下眼睛，说道。 “我是孟德斯鸠的崇拜者，”安德烈公爵说，“他的思想是le　principe　des　monarchies　est　I\u0027nonneur，me　parait　incontestable．Certains　droits　et　privilèges　de　la　noblesse　me　paraissent　eBtre　des　moyens　de　soutenir　ce　sentiment”。① 斯佩兰斯基白皙的脸上原有的笑容消失了，因此他的脸孔就显得更好看了。也许他觉得，安德烈公爵的思想是很有趣的。 “Si　vous　envisagez　la　question　sous　ce　point　de　vue．”②他开始说，显然，法国话难说，比说俄国话更慢，但是他非常镇静。他说，荣誉，l′honneur，不可能受到对供职有害的优越地位的维护，荣誉，l′honneur，或者是不做应受指责的行为的消极概念，或者是为赢得赞许和奖赏而热心进取的一种源泉。 ①法语：荣誉是帝制的基础，我觉得这是毫无疑义的。我以为贵族的某些权利和优越地位是维护这种虚荣心的手段。 ②法语：如果您从这个观点看问题。 “这个维护荣誉、维护热心进取的源泉的制度，是类似伟大的拿破仑皇帝的Légion　l\u0027honneur①的制度，它不仅无害，而且有助于事业成就，不过它不是阶层或宫廷的优越地位和权力。” “我不争辩，但不能否认，宫廷的优越地位和权力达到了同样的目的，”安德烈公爵说，“每个朝臣都认为自己应当名副其实地履行职务。” “公爵，可是您不想利用优越的职位，”斯佩兰斯基说，面露微笑，借以表示他想客客气气地结束这场使对话人感到尴尬的辩论。“如果您在礼拜三光临敝舍，”他补充说，“我和马格尼茨基磋商之后，便把使您感兴趣的事情告诉您，此外，我将有机会更详细地和您谈谈。”他闭上眼睛，行鞠躬礼，à　la　francaise②，不辞而退，极力不引人注意，走出了大厅。 ①法语：荣誉团。 ②法语：照法国方式。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3405.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy,
