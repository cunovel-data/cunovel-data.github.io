{"id":40984,"no":9,"title":"Book 1 Chapter 9","content":"OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE, not reckoning the countess\u0027s elder daughter (who was four years older than her sister and behaved quite like a grown-up person) and the young lady visitor, there were left in the drawing-room Nikolay and Sonya, the niece. Sonya was a slender, miniature brunette, with soft eyes shaded by long lashes, thick black hair twisted in two coils round her head, and a skin of a somewhat sallow tint, particularly marked on her bare, thin, but shapely, muscular arms and neck. The smoothness of her movements, the softness and flexibility of her little limbs, and something of slyness and reserve in her manner, suggested a lovely half-grown kitten, which would one day be a charming cat. Apparently she thought it only proper to show an interest in the general conversation and to smile. But against her own will, her eyes turned under their thick, long lashes to her cousin, who was going away into the army, with such girlish, passionate adoration, that her smile could not for one moment impose upon any one, and it was clear that the kitten had only perched there to skip off more energetically than ever and to play with her cousin as soon as they could, like Boris and Natasha, get out of the drawing-room.\n “Yes, ma chère,” said the old count, addressing the visitor and pointing to his Nikolay; “here his friend Boris has received his commission as an officer, and he\u0027s so fond of him he doesn\u0027t want to be left behind, and is giving up the university and his poor old father to go into the army, ma chère. And there was a place all ready for him in the archives department, and all. Isn\u0027t that friendship now?” said the count interrogatively.\n “But they do say that war has been declared, you know,” said the visitor.\n “They\u0027ve been saying so a long while,” said the count. “They\u0027ll say so again and again, and so it will remain. There\u0027s friendship for you, ma chère!” he repeated. “He\u0027s going into the hussars.”\n The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.\n “It\u0027s not from friendship at all,” answered Nikolay, flushing hotly, and denying it as though it were some disgraceful imputation. “Not friendship at all, but simply I feel drawn to the military service.”\n He looked round at his cousin and the young lady visitor; both looked at him with a smile of approval.\n “Schubert\u0027s dining with us to-night, the colonel of the Pavologradsky regiment of hussars. He has been here on leave, and is taking him with him. There\u0027s no help for it,” said the count, shrugging his shoulder and speaking playfully of what evidently was a source of much distress to him.\n “I\u0027ve told you already, papa,” said his son, “that if you\u0027re unwilling to let me go, I\u0027ll stay. But I know I\u0027m no good for anything except in the army. I\u0027m not a diplomatist, or a government clerk. I\u0027m not clever at disguising my feelings,” he said, glancing repeatedly with the coquetry of handsome youth at Sonya and the young lady.\n The kitten, her eyes riveted on him, seemed on the point of breaking into frolic, and showing her cat-like nature.\n “Well, well, it\u0027s all-right!” said the old count; “he always gets so hot. Bonaparte\u0027s turned all their heads; they\u0027re all dreaming of how he rose from a lieutenant to be an emperor. Well, and so may it turn out again, please God,” he added, not noticing the visitor\u0027s sarcastic smile.\n While their elders began talking about Bonaparte, Julie, Madame Karagin\u0027s daughter, turned to young Rostov.\n “What a pity you weren\u0027t at the Arharovs\u0027 on Thursday. I was so dull without you,” she said, giving him a tender smile. The youth, highly flattered, moved with a coquettish smile nearer her, and entered into a conversation apart with the smiling Julie, entirely unaware that his unconscious smile had dealt a jealous stab to the heart of Sonya, who was flushing crimson and assuming a forced smile. In the middle of his talk with Julie he glanced round at her. Sonya gave him an intensely furious look, and, hardly able to restrain her tears, though there was still a constrained smile on her lips, she got up and went out of the room. All Nikolay\u0027s animation was gone. He waited for the first break in the conversation, and, with a face of distress, walked out of the room to look for Sonya.\n “How all the young things wear their hearts on their sleeves!” said Anna Mihalovna, pointing to Nikolay\u0027s retreating figure. “Cousinage, dangereux voisinage,” she added.\n “Yes,” said the countess, when the sunshine that had come into the drawing-room with the young people had vanished. She was, as it were, replying to a question which no one had put to her, but which was always in her thoughts: “What miseries, what anxieties one has gone through for the happiness one has in them now! And even now one feels really more dread than joy over them. One\u0027s always in terror! At this age particularly when there are so many dangers both for girls and boys.”\n “Everything depends on bringing up,” said the visitor.\n “Yes, you are right,” the countess went on. “So far I have been, thank God, my children\u0027s friend and have enjoyed their full confidence,” said the countess, repeating the error of so many parents, who imagine their children have no secrets from them. “I know I shall always be first in my children\u0027s confidence, and that Nikolay, if, with his impulsive character, he does get into mischief (boys will be boys) it won\u0027t be like these Petersburg young gentlemen.”\n “Yes, they\u0027re capital children, capital children,” assented the count, who always solved all perplexing questions by deciding that everything was capital. “Fancy now, his taking it into his head to be an hussar! But what can one expect, ma chère?”\n “What a sweet little thing your younger girl is!” said the visitor. “Full of fun and mischief!”\n “Yes, that she is,” said the count. “She takes after me! And such a voice; though she\u0027s my daughter, it\u0027s the truth I\u0027m telling you, she\u0027ll be a singer, another Salomini. We\u0027ve engaged an Italian to give her lessons.”\n “Isn\u0027t it too early? They say it injures the voice to train it at that age.”\n “Oh, no! Too early!” said the count. “Why, our mothers used to be married at twelve and thirteen.”\n “Well, she\u0027s in love with Boris already! What do you say to that?” said the countess, smiling softly and looking at Boris\u0027s mother. And apparently in reply to the question that was always in her mind, she went on: “Why, you know, if I were strict with her, if I were to forbid her…God knows what they might not be doing in secret” (the countess meant that they might kiss each other), “but as it is I know every word she utters. She\u0027ll come to me this evening and tell me everything of herself. I spoil her, perhaps, but I really believe it\u0027s the best way. I brought my elder girl up more strictly.”\n “Yes, I was brought up quite differently,” said the elder girl, the handsome young Countess Vera; and she smiled. But the smile did not improve Vera\u0027s face; on the contrary her face looked unnatural, and therefore unpleasing. Vera was good-looking; she was not stupid, was clever at her lessons, and well educated; she had a pleasant voice, and what she said was true and appropriate. But, strange to say, every one—both the visitor and the countess—looked at her, as though wondering why she had said it, and conscious of a certain awkwardness.\n “People are always too clever with their elder children; they try to do something exceptional with them,” said the visitor.\n “We won\u0027t conceal our errors, ma chère! My dear countess was too clever with Vera,” said the count. “But what of it? she has turned out capitally all the same,” he added, with a wink of approval to Vera.\n The guests got up and went away, promising to come to dinner.\n “What manners! Staying on and on!” said the countess, when she had seen her guests out.\n ①法语：表兄。\n “是呀，有人说已经宣战了。”女客人说。\n “早就有人在说啊，”伯爵说道，“说了一阵子，又说一阵子，就不再说了。machère，这不就是看情面嘛！”他把自己说过的话重说一遍，“尼古拉去当骠骑兵了。”\n 女客摇摇头，不知道要说什么话。\n “根本不是为友情，”尼古拉答道，涨红了脸，好像他受到一种使他羞愧的诋毁似的，他于是要为自己辩护，“根本不是为友情，而只是觉得我有服兵役的天职。”\n 他回头望望表妹，又望望做客的小姐，她们二人都面露称赞的微笑望着他。\n “保罗格勒骠骑兵团上校舒伯特今天在我们这儿吃午饭，他在这儿度假，要把尼古拉带走。这有什么法子呢？”伯爵说道，耸耸肩，诙谐地提起这件显然使他深感痛楚的事情。\n “爸爸，我已经跟您说过，”儿子说道，“如果您不愿意放我走，那么我就留下来。但是我知道，除开服兵役而外，我毫无用场；我不是外交家，不是官员，不善于掩饰自己的感情，”他说道，露出风华正茂之时的轻薄的样子，不时地端详索尼娅和做客的小姐。\n 小猫用眼睛紧紧地盯住他，随时都准备嬉戏一通，表露一下它那猫的本性。\n “嗯，嗯，好极了！”老伯爵说道，“向来就急躁……波拿巴还在冲昏大家的头脑，大家都想到他由中尉摇身一变当上皇帝了。也罢，愿上帝保佑。”他补充一句，并不注意女客嘲讽的微笑。\n 成年人开始谈论波拿巴的事情。卡拉金娜的女儿朱莉把脸转向小罗斯托夫，说道：\n “很遗憾，星期四那天您没有到阿尔哈罗夫家里去。您不在场，我觉得寂寞无聊。”她说道，向他露出温和的微笑。\n 年轻人因受奉承而深感荣幸，脸上呈露出风华正茂之时的轻浮的微笑，他坐得离她更近了，他和那笑容可掬的朱莉单独地闲聊起来，根本没发觉他这情不自禁的微笑竟像一柄醋意的尖刀戳进那面红耳赤、佯装微笑的索尼娅的心窝。闲谈的中间，他回过头来瞥了她一眼，索尼娅愤恨地望望他，好不容易才忍住没有流出眼泪，没有露出假装的微笑，她站起来，从房里走出去。尼古拉的兴奋情绪已经消逝了。他窥伺谈话一中断，就露出扫兴的神态，从房里出来，寻找索尼娅去了。\n “所有这些年轻人的秘密事情真藏不住，会露出马脚啊！”安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜指着正走出门去的尼古拉说道。“CousiBnage－dangereuxvoisinage，”①她补充一句。\n “是的，”伯爵夫人说道，随同这一代年轻人进入客厅带来的一线阳光消失后，她仿佛在回答未曾有人向她提出、但却经常使她全神贯注的问题似的，“她经受了多少苦难、多少烦扰，现在才能从他们身上得到一点欢乐啊！可是现在，说实话，恐惧的比重却大于欢乐。你总是怕这怕那，总是怕这怕那啊！男孩也好，女孩也好，正值这个年龄，就会遇到许多危险的事情。”\n “一切以教育为转移。”女客人说道。\n “是的，您说的是真话，”伯爵夫人继续说道，“谢天谢地，直至现在，我还是我的子女的朋友，我博得他们充分的信赖。”伯爵夫人说，许多父母出过差错，我重蹈覆辙，他们都以为，子女并没有隐瞒他们的秘密，“我知道，我永远是我的几个女儿的第一个confidente②，尼古拉性情急躁，要是他淘气（男孩子哪能不淘气），也不会像彼得堡这些绅士派头的人那样。” \n ①法语：表兄弟、表姐妹这种亲戚真糟糕透了啊。\n ②法语：出主意的人。\n “你的小女儿是个多么可爱的人儿！”女客人说道，“火性子人！”\n “是的，火性子人，”伯爵说道，“她就像我啊！她有一副悦耳的嗓子：虽然她是我的儿女，但我也要如实说来。她将来是个歌唱家，又是一个萨洛莫妮。我们延请了一位意大利人教她唱歌。”\n “不是太早了吗？据说，她这个时候学唱对嗓子不利。”\n “哦，不，哪里太早啊！”伯爵说道，“我们母亲辈十二三岁不就出嫁了吗？”\n “她现在就已爱上鲍里斯了！她怎么样？”伯爵夫人说道，两眼望着鲍里斯的母亲，悄悄地露出微笑，虽然在回答经常使她心神贯注的问题，她继续说下去，“哦，您知道，如果我对她严加管教，如果我禁止她……天知道，他们偷偷地会做出什么事（伯爵夫人心中暗指，他们会接吻），可是现在，她说的每句话我都知道。她晚上自己跑回家来，把一切情形讲给我听。我也许正在惯养她，不过，说实话，这样做似乎更妙。我对大女儿管教得很严。”\n “是的，教育我的方式完全不一样。”长女——漂亮的名叫薇拉的伯爵小姐面带微笑地说道。\n 但是微笑并没有使薇拉的面部变得更加漂亮，这是一件常见的事，恰好适得其反，她的脸色变得不太自然，从而令人生厌。长女薇拉长得俊俏，并不笨拙，学习成绩优良，受到很好的教育，她的嗓子悠扬悦耳，她说的话合情合理，恰如其分，但是，说来令人诧异，女客也好，伯爵夫人也好，大家都竟然回过头来望她一眼，仿佛十分惊讶似的，为什么她要说这番话，大家都觉得尴尬。\n “大家总对年龄较大的儿童自作主张，总想做出什么不平凡的事业。”女客人说道。\n “machère，不用隐瞒，承认好了！伯爵夫人对薇拉的事自作主张，”伯爵说道。“这又有什么关系啊！她毕竟变成一个很好的姑娘。”他补充说道，向薇拉递个眼色，表示赞成的意思。\n 女客们站了起来，答应来吃午饭，便乘马车走了。\n “是什么派头！他们都坐着，坐着不走！”伯爵夫人送走客人后说道。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3296.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
