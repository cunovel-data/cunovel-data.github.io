{"id":41170,"no":195,"title":"Book 10 Chapter 9","content":"UNTIL PRINCE ANDREY\u0027S STAY at Bogutcharovo, the estate had never had an owner in residence, and the Bogutcharovo peasants were of quite a different character from the peasants of Bleak Hills. They differed from them in speech, in dress, and in manners. They said they came from the steppes. The old prince praised them for their industry when they came to Bleak Hills for harvesting, or digging ponds and ditches; but he did not like them because of their savage manners.\n Prince Andrey\u0027s residence at Bogutcharovo, and his innovations—his hospitals and schools and the lowering of their rent—had not softened their manners, but, on the contrary, had intensified their traits of character, which the old prince called their savagery.\n Obscure rumours were always current among them: at one time a belief that they were all to be carried off to be made Cossacks, then that they were to be converted to some new religion, then rumours of some supposed proclamations of the Tsar, or of the oath to the Tsar Pavel Petrovitch in 1797 (which was said to have granted freedom to the peasants, and to have been withdrawn by the gentry later); then of the expected return of the Tsar Peter Fedorovitch, who was to rise again from the dead in seven years, and to bring perfect freedom, and to make an end of the existing order of things. Rumours of the war, and Bonaparte and his invasion, were connected in their minds with vague conceptions of Antichrist, of the end of the world, and perfect freedom.\n In the vicinity of Bogutcharovo were large villages inhabited by Crown serfs, or peasants who paid rent to absentee owners. There were very few resident landowners in the neighbourhood, and consequently very few house-serfs or peasants able to read and write. And among the peasants of that part of the country there could be seen more distinctly and strongly marked than among others those mysterious undercurrents in the life of the Russian peasantry, which are so baffling to contemporaries. Twenty years before, there had been a movement among the peasants of the district to emigrate to certain supposedly warm rivers. Hundreds of peasants, among them those of Bogutcharovo, had suddenly begun selling their cattle and moving away with their families towards the south-west. Like birds flying to unknown realms over the ocean, these men with their wives and children turned towards the south-west, where no one of them had been. They set off in caravans, redeemed their freedom one by one, ran and drove and walked to the unknown region of the warm springs. Many were punished; some sent to Siberia; many died of cold and hunger on the road; many came back of their own accord; and the movement died down as it had begun without obvious cause. But the undercurrents still flowed among the people, and were gathering force for some new manifestation, destined to appear as strangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. In 1812 any one living in close relations with the peasants might have observed that there was a violent ferment working below the surface, and an outbreak of some kind was at hand.\n Alpatitch, who came to Bogutcharovo a little while before the old prince\u0027s death, noticed that there was some excitement among the peasants; and noticed that, unlike Bleak Hills district, where within a radius of sixty versts all the peasants had moved away, abandoning their villages to be wasted by the Cossacks, in the Bogutcharovo steppe country the peasants had entered, it was said, into communication with the French, and were remaining in their homes, and there were some mysterious documents circulating among them. He learned through serfs who were attached to him that the peasant Karp, a man of great influence in the village, had a few days previously accompanied a government transport, and had returned with the news that the Cossacks were destroying the deserted villages, while the French would not touch them. He knew that another peasant had on the previous day even brought from the hamlet of Vislouhovo, where the French were encamped, a proclamation from the French general that no harm would be done to the inhabitants, and that everything taken from them would be paid for, if they would remain. In token of good faith, the peasant brought from Vislouhovo a hundred-rouble note (he did not know it was false), paid him in advance for hay.\n And last, and most important of all, Alpatitch learned that on the day on which he had given the village elder orders to collect carts to move the princess\u0027s luggage from Bogutcharovo, there had been a meeting in the village at which it was resolved to wait and not to move. Meanwhile, time was pressing. On the day of the prince\u0027s death, the 15th of August, the marshal urged Princess Marya to move the same day, as it was becoming dangerous. He said that he could not answer for what might happen after the 16th. He drove away that evening, promising to return next morning for the funeral. But next day he could not come, as he received information of an expected advance of the French, and was only just in time to get his family and valuables moved away from his own estate.\n For nearly thirty years Bogutcharovo had been under the direction of the village elder, Dron, called by the old prince, Dronushka.\n Dron was one of those physically and morally vigorous peasants, who grow a thick beard as soon as they are grown up, and go on almost unchanged till sixty or seventy, without a grey hair or the loss of a tooth, as upright and vigorous at sixty as at thirty.\n Shortly after the attempted migration to the warm rivers, in which he had taken part with the rest, Dron was made village elder and overseer of Bogutcharovo, and had filled those positions irreproachably for twenty-three years. The peasants were more afraid of him than of their master. The old prince and the young one and the steward respected him, and called him in joke the minister. Dron had never once been drunk or ill since he had been appointed elder; he had never after sleepless nights or severe labour shown the slightest signs of fatigue; and though he could not read or write, he never forgot an account of the pounds of flour in the huge waggon-loads he sold, and of the money paid for them, nor missed a sheaf of wheat on an acre of the Bogutcharovo fields.\n This peasant Dron it was for whom Alpatitch sent on coming from the plundered estate at Bleak Hills. He ordered him to get ready twelve horses for the princess\u0027s carriages, and eighteen conveyances for the move which was to be made from Bogutcharovo. Though the peasants paid rent instead of working as serfs, Alpatitch expected to meet no difficulty on their part in carrying out this order, since there were two hundred and thirty efficient families in Bogutcharovo, and the peasants were well-to-do. But Dron, on receiving the order, dropped his eyes and made no reply. Alpatitch mentioned the names of peasants from whom he told him to take the carts.\n Dron replied that the horses belonging to those peasants were away on hire. Alpatitch mentioned the names of other peasants. They too, according to Dron, had no horses available: some were employed in government transport, others had gone lame, and others had died through the shortness of forage. In Dron\u0027s opinion, there was no hope of getting horses enough for the princess\u0027s carriages, not to speak of the transport of baggage.\n Alpatitch looked intently at Dron and scowled. Dron was a model village elder, but Alpatitch had not been twenty years managing the prince\u0027s estates for nothing, and he too was a model steward. He possessed in the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of the peasants, with whom he had to deal, and was consequently an excellent steward. Glancing at Dron, he saw at once that his answers were not the expression of his own ideas, but the expression of the general drift of opinion in the Bogutcharovo village, by which the elder had already been carried away. At the same time, he knew that Dron, who had saved money and was detested by the village, must be hesitating between two camps—the master\u0027s and the peasants\u0027. He detected the hesitation in his eyes, and so frowning he came closer to Dron.\n “Now, Dronushka,” he said, “you listen to me! Don\u0027t you talk nonsense to me. His excellency, Prince Andrey Nikolaevitch, himself gave me orders to move the folk away, and not leave them with the enemy, and the Tsar has issued a decree that it is to be so. Any one that stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you hear?”\n “I hear,” answered Dron, not raising his eyes.\n Alpatitch was not satisfied with his reply.\n “Ay, Dron, there\u0027ll be trouble!” said Alpatitch, shaking his head.\n “It\u0027s for you to command!” said Dron dejectedly.\n “Ay, Dron, drop it!” repeated Alpatitch, taking his hand out of the bosom of his coat, and pointing with a solemn gesture to the ground under Dron\u0027s feet. “I can see right through you; and more than that, I can see three yards into the earth under you,” he said, looking at the ground under Dron\u0027s feet.\n Dron was disconcerted; he looked furtively at Alpatitch, and dropped his eyes again.\n “You drop this nonsense, and tell the folks to pack up to leave their homes and go to Moscow, and to get ready carts to-morrow morning for the princess\u0027s luggage; and don\u0027t you go to the meeting. Do you hear?”\n All at once Dron threw himself at his feet.\n “Yakov Alpatitch, discharge me! Take the keys from me; discharge me, for Christ\u0027s sake!”\n “Stop that!” said Alpatitch sternly. “I can see through you three yards into the earth,” he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his knowledge of the right day to sow the oats, and his success in pleasing the old prince for twenty years had long ago gained him the reputation of a wizard, and that the power of seeing for three yards under a man is ascribed to wizards.\n Dron got up, and would have said something, but Alpatitch interrupted him.\n “What\u0027s this you\u0027ve all got in your head? Eh? … What are you thinking about? Eh?”\n “What am I to do with the people?” said Dron. “They\u0027re all in a ferment. I do tell them …”\n “Oh, I dare say you do,” said Alpatitch. “Are they drinking?” he asked briefly.\n “They\u0027re all in a ferment, Yakov Alpatitch; they have got hold of another barrel.”\n “Then you listen to me. I\u0027ll go to the police-captain and you tell them so, and tell them to drop all this and get the carts ready.”\n “Certainly,” answered Dron.\n Yakov Alpatitch did not insist further. He had much experience in managing the peasants, and knew that the chief means for securing obedience was not to show the slightest suspicion that they could do anything but obey. Having wrung from Dron a submissive “certainly,” Yakov Alpatitch rested content with it, though he had more than doubts—he had a conviction—that the carts would not be provided without the intervention of the military authorities.\n And as a fact when evening came, the carts had not been provided. There had been again a village meeting at the tavern, and at the meeting it had been resolved to drive the horses out into the forest and not to provide the conveyances. Without saying a word of all this to the princess, Alpatitch ordered his own baggage to be unloaded from the waggons that had come from Bleak Hills and the horses to be taken from them for the princess\u0027s carriage, while he rode off himself to the police authorities.\n 安德烈公爵在这一次来博古恰罗沃之前不久，曾来这里住过一段时间，他创办了一些新设施——医院、学校和减轻免役税①，等等，这一切并未能略微改变他们的习俗，而且相反，更加强了他们那些被老公爵称之为野性的性格特点。在他们中间经常流传着一些含含混混的谣言，时而传说要把他们全都编入哥萨克，时而传说要他们改信一种新的宗教，时而传说沙皇颁布了什么告示，时而传说一七九七年保罗·彼得罗维奇的誓词（关于这一誓词的传说是，已经赐给他们自由，但是被地主们剥夺了），时而传说彼得·费奥多罗维奇②过七年要复位，那时一切都很自由，一切都很简单，什么麻烦事情都不会再有了。关于战争和波拿巴，以及他入侵的传闻，在他们的头脑中，跟基督的敌人、世界末日和绝对自由等模糊观念混在一起。 \n ①封建时代为免劳役所交纳的赋税。\n ②彼得三世皇帝，在一七六二年其妻叶卡捷琳娜二世即位的时候，被刺杀或病死了；但是沙皇在农民的头脑中是永生的，他们不相信沙皇会死去。\n 阿尔帕特奇是在老公爵临终前不久来到博古恰罗沃的。他发现，在这里的人当中有一种激动不安的情绪，这里与童山地区的情况则完全相反，在那里方圆六十里内的农民都逃走了，他们把村庄留给哥萨克去破坏。而在博古恰罗沃周围草原地带，听说他们跟法国人有过联系，他们得到过法国人的传单，这些传单在他们当中流传，他们都停留不动。他通过几个心腹家奴获悉，前几天赶官府大车的农民卡尔普（此人在村公社①有很大影响）从外地带回来一个消息，说哥萨克破坏那些居民外逃的村庄，而法国人却不动他们一根毫毛。他知道，还有一个农民昨天从法军占领的维斯洛乌霍沃村带回来一张法国将军颁发的布告，布告上说，一定不会加害居民，只要他们留在原处不动，凡是从他们手里取的东西，都照价付钱。作为这一点的证明，这个农民从维斯洛乌霍沃村带回预先支付的一百卢布的干草款（他不知道这是些假钞票）。 \n ①沙皇时代的农村公社。\n 村长德龙（老公爵叫他德龙努什卡）管理博古恰罗沃已经三十来年了。\n 德龙是这一带有强壮体魄的精神饱满的农民之一，这些壮实汉子一成年就长满脸的大胡子，一直到六、七十岁模样一点不变，头上没有一根白头发，不掉一颗牙，六十岁的人就好像三十岁的人一样刚健有力。\n 德龙也像别的农民一样，参加过向温暖的河流迁徙的运动，回来不久，他被指派为博古恰罗沃的村长，自那时起，他无可指责地在这个职位上坐了二十三年。农民们怕他甚过怕他们的主人。主人们——老公爵、小公爵，以及管家的，都尊重他，并戏称他是“家务大臣”。德龙在全部任职期间没有醉过一次酒，没有生过一次病；不论是一连几天几夜不睡觉，也不论干了多劳累的话，从来没有露出过一丝倦容，他虽然目不识丁，却从来不曾忘记一笔帐，他轻手卖掉无数车的面粉，从来也没有忘掉——普特，他从来没有忘掉在博古恰罗沃的每俄亩土地上收获的任何一堆粮食。\n 在老公爵下葬的那一天，从被破坏了的童山来的阿尔帕特奇把这个德龙叫来，吩咐他为公爵小姐的马车准备十二匹马和十八辆大车，以便从博古恰罗沃动身。虽然，农民都是交免役税户，但在阿尔帕特奇看来，执行这个命令不致于会有什么困难，因为博古恰罗沃有二百三十户交免役税户，他们户户都富裕。然而村长德龙听到这个命令，默默地垂下眼皮。阿尔帕特奇把他知道的农民的名字说给他听，命令他从他们那里征集大车。\n 德龙回答说，这些农户的马都在外面拉脚，阿尔帕特奇又说出另外一些农民。按照德龙的说法，这些农户没有马，有一些马正在替官府运输，另一些马已不中用，还有些马因为缺少饲料给饿死了，照德龙所说，不但找不到拉行李的马，连拉人坐的车所用的马也弄不到了。\n 阿尔帕特奇凝神地看了看德龙，紧锁眉头。正如德龙是一个模范村长一样，阿尔帕特奇并非白白地把公爵的田庄管理了二十年，他是一个模范管家。他凭嗅觉就能了解那些与他打交道的人的需要和本能，他有高度的才能，因此他是一个出色的管家。他看了德龙一眼，立刻就明白，德龙的回答并不代表他本人的思想，而是代表博古恰罗沃村公社那种普遍的情绪，这位村长已经屈从于村公社农户的这种情绪。然而，他同时也知道，发了财的和被全村仇视的德龙，必然在地主和农奴两个阵营之间摇摆不定。他从他的眼神中看出了这种动摇。于是阿尔帕特奇皱起眉头，向他走近了些。\n “你，德龙努什卡，给我听着！你少给我说废话。安德烈·尼古拉伊奇公爵大人亲口向我吩咐过，全体老百姓都得走，不能留在敌占区，沙皇也下了同样的命令。谁留下不走，谁就是沙皇的叛徒。听见没有。”\n “听见了！”德龙连眼皮都没有抬一下，他回答道。\n 阿尔帕特奇对这一回答不满意。\n “哎，德龙，不会有好下场的！”阿尔帕特奇摇着头，说。\n “全由您作主！”德龙悲哀地说。\n “哎，德龙，不用再说了吧！”阿尔帕特奇又重复说，他从怀里抽出手来，庄严地指着德龙脚下的地板。“我不但可以看透你，就是你脚底下三尺都可以看个透。”他看着德龙脚下的地板说。\n 德龙着了慌，偷看了阿尔帕特奇一眼，又搭拉下眼皮。\n “你少说那些废话，去通知老百姓收拾好准备前往莫斯科，明天一大早把运公爵小姐行李的大车准备好，你本人不要去参加会，听见没有？”\n 德龙突然跪了下去。\n “雅科夫·阿尔帕特奇，把我撤职吧，请把钥匙拿去，看在耶稣的份上，把我撤了职吧。”\n “收起你那一套！”阿尔帕特奇严厉地说。“我可以看透你脚下三尺深处，”他又重复着说，熟悉他那养蜂的技巧，他那适时播种燕麦的知识，以及他能一连二十年保持老公爵恩宠这一事实，使他久已获得神巫的名声，人们认为，只有神巫才能看透脚下三尺深的地方。\n 德龙站起身，想要说点什么，但是阿尔帕特奇阻住了他。\n “您怎么会想到这里？咹？……您是怎么想的？咹？”\n “我拿老百姓怎么办呢？”德龙说，“全都疯了，我也是那么对他们说的呀……”\n “我也是那么说，”阿尔帕特奇说，“他们在喝酒？”他简短地问了一句。\n “全都发了狂。雅科夫·阿尔帕特奇；他们又弄来一桶。”\n “你给我听着。我到警察局长那里去，你去管一下老百姓，要他们不要干这种事，把大车都准备好。”\n “我听见了。”德龙回答道。\n 雅科夫·阿尔帕特奇不再坚持了。他在长时期对老百姓的统治中知道，要使人们服从的一个主要手段就是不要向他们流露出对他们有可能会不服从的怀疑。从德龙的口中得到顺从的“是的——您老”这一句回话，雅科夫·阿尔帕特奇感到满意，虽然他不但怀疑，而且差不多相信，不借助军队的力量，根本弄不到大车。\n 果真，到了晚上，大车并未来到。在村中的酒馆旁边又举行了一次集会，在会上决定把马赶到森林中去，并且不出大车。阿尔帕特奇没有把这件事告诉公爵小姐。他吩咐把从童山来的大车上的他的全部行李都卸下来，把那些马套在公爵小姐的马车上，之后，他亲自去找地方官长去了。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3493.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
