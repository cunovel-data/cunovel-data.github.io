{"id":41030,"no":55,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 9","content":"THE DAY AFTER THE REVIEW Boris Drubetskoy put on his best uniform, and accompanied by his comrade Berg\u0027s good wishes for his success, rode to Olmütz to see Bolkonsky, in the hope of profiting by his friendliness to obtain a better position, especially the position of an adjutant in attendance on some personage of importance, a post which seemed to him particularly alluring.\\n\\n “It\u0027s all very well for Rostov, whose father sends him ten thousand at a time, to talk about not caring to cringe to any one, and not being a lackey to any man. But I, with nothing of my own but my brains, have my career to make, and mustn\u0027t let opportunities slip, but must make the most of them.”\\n\\n He did not find Prince Andrey at Olmütz that day. But the sight of Olmütz—where were the headquarters and the diplomatic corps, and where both Emperors with their suites, their households, and their court, were staying—only strengthened his desire to belong to this upper world.\\n\\n He knew no one; and in spite of his smart guardsman\u0027s uniform, all these exalted persons, racing to and fro about the streets in their elegant carriages, plumes, ribbons, and orders, courtiers and military alike, all seemed to be so immeasurably above him, a little officer in the Guards, as to be not simply unwilling, but positively unable to recognise his existence. At the quarters of the commander-in-chief, Kutuzov, where he asked for Bolkonsky, all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as though they wished to impress on him that a great many officers of his sort came hanging about here, and that they were all heartily sick of seeing them. In spite of this, or rather in consequence of it, he went again the following day, the 15th, after dinner, to Olmütz, and going into the house occupied by Kutuzov, asked for Bolkonsky. Prince Andrey was at home, and Boris was ushered into a large room, probably at some time used for dancing. Now there were five bedsteads in it and furniture of various kinds: a table, chairs, a clavichord. One adjutant was sitting in a Persian dressing-gown writing at a table near the door. Another, the stout, red-faced Nesvitsky, was lying on a bed, his arms under his head, laughing with an officer sitting by the bedside. A third was playing a Vienna waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth lay on the clavichord, humming to the tune. Bolkonsky was not in the room. Not one of these gentlemen changed his position on observing Boris. The one who was writing, on being applied to by Boris, turned round with an air of annoyance, and told him that Bolkonsky was the adjutant on duty, and that he should go to the door to the left, into the reception-room, if he wanted to see him. Boris thanked him, and went to the reception-room. There he found some ten officers and generals.\\n\\n At the moment when Boris entered, Prince Andrey dropping his eye-lids disdainfully (with that peculiar air of courteous weariness which so distinctly says, “If it were not my duty, I would not stay talking to you for a minute”), was listening to an old Russian general with many decorations, who, rigidly erect, almost on tiptoe, was laying some matter before Prince Andrey with the obsequious expression of a common soldier on his purple face.\\n\\n “Very good, be so kind as to wait a moment,” he said to the general in Russian, with that French accent with which he always spoke when he meant to speak disdainfully, and noticing Boris, Prince Andrey took no further notice of the general (who ran after him with entreaties, begging him to hear something more), but nodded to Boris with a bright smile, as he turned towards him. At that moment Boris saw distinctly what he had had an inkling of before, that is, that quite apart from that subordination and discipline, which is written down in the drill-book, and recognised in the regiment and known to him, there was in the army another and more actual subordination, that which made this rigid, purple-faced general wait respectfully while Prince Andrey—of captain\u0027s rank—found it more in accordance with his pleasure to talk to Lieutenant Drubetskoy. Boris felt more than ever determined to follow in future the guidance not of the written code laid down in the regulations, but of this unwritten code. He felt now that simply because he had been recommended to Prince Andrey, he had become at one step superior to the general, who in other circumstances, at the front, could annihilate a mere lieutenant in the guards like him. Prince Andrey went up to him and shook hands.\\n\\n “Very sorry you didn\u0027t find me in yesterday. I was busy the whole day with the Germans. We went with Weierother to survey the disposition. When Germans start being accurate, there\u0027s no end to it!”\\n\\n Boris smiled, as though he understood, as a matter of common knowledge, what Prince Andrey was referring to. But it was the first time he had heard the name of Weierother, or even the word “disposition” used in that sense.\\n\\n “Well, my dear boy, you still want an adjutant\u0027s post? I have been thinking about you since I saw you.”\\n\\n “Yes,” said Boris, involuntarily flushing for some reason, “I was thinking of asking the commander-in-chief; he has had a letter about me from Prince Kuragin; and I wanted to ask him simply because,” he added, as though excusing himself, “I am afraid the guards won\u0027t be in action.”\\n\\n “Very good, very good! we will talk it over later,” said Prince Andrey, “only let me report on this gentleman\u0027s business and I am at your disposal.” While Prince Andrey was away reporting to the commander-in-chief on the business of the purple-faced general, that general, who apparently did not share Boris\u0027s views as to the superior advantages of the unwritten code, glared at the insolent lieutenant, who had hindered his having his say out, so that Boris began to be uncomfortable. He turned away and waited with impatience for Prince Andrey to come out of the commander-in-chief\u0027s room.\\n\\n “Well, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,” said Prince Andrey, when they had gone into the big room with the clavichord in it. “It\u0027s no use your going to the commander-in-chief; he will say a lot of polite things to you, will ask you to dine with him” (“that wouldn\u0027t come amiss in the service of that unwritten code,” thought Boris), “but nothing more would come of it; we shall soon have a complete battalion of adjutants and orderly officers. But I tell you what we will do: I have a friend, a general adjutant and an excellent fellow, Prince Dolgorukov. And though you may not be aware of it, the fact is that Kutuzov and his staff and all of us are just now of no account at all. Everything now is concentrated about the Emperor, so we\u0027ll go together to Dolgorukov. I have to go to see him, and I have already spoken of you to him. So we can see whether he may not think it possible to find a post for you on his staff, or somewhere there nearer to the sun.”\\n\\n Prince Andrey was always particularly keen over guiding a young man and helping him to attain worldly success. Under cover of this help for another, which he would never have accepted for himself, he was brought into the circle which bestowed success, and which attracted him. He very readily took up Boris\u0027s cause, and went with him to Prince Dolgorukov.\\n\\n It was late in the evening as they entered the palace at Olmütz, occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.\\n\\n There had been on that same day a council of war, at which all the members of the Hofkriegsrath and the two Emperors had been present. At the council it had been decided, contrary to the advice of the elder generals, Kutuzov and Prince Schwarzenberg, to advance at once and to fight a general engagement with Bonaparte. The council of war was only just over when Prince Andrey, accompanied by Boris, went into the palace in search of Prince Dolgorukov. Every one at headquarters was still under the spell of the victory gained that day by the younger party at the council of war. The voices of those who urged delay, and counselled waiting for something and not advancing, had been so unanimously drowned and their arguments had been confuted by such indubitable proofs of the advantages of advancing, that what had been discussed at the council, the future battle and the victory certain to follow it, seemed no longer future but past. All the advantages were on our side. Our immense forces, undoubtedly superior to those of Napoleon, were concentrated in one place; the troops were encouraged by the presence of the two Emperors, and were eager for battle. The strategic position on which they were to act was to the minutest detail known to the Austrian general Weierother, who was at the head of the troops (as a lucky chance would have it, the Austrian troops had chosen for their man?uvres the very fields in which they had now to fight the French). Every detail of the surrounding neighbourhood was known and put down on maps, while Bonaparte, apparently growing feebler, was taking no measures.\\n\\n Dolgorukov, who had been one of the warmest advocates of attack, had just come back from the council, weary, exhausted, but eager and proud of the victory he had gained. Prince Andrey presented the officer for whom he was asking his influence, but Prince Dolgorukov, though he shook hands politely and warmly, said nothing to Boris. Obviously unable to restrain himself from uttering the thoughts which were engrossing him at that moment, he addressed Prince Andrey in French.\\n\\n “Well, my dear fellow, what a battle we have won! God only grant that the one which will be the result of it may be as victorious. I must own, though, my dear fellow,” he said jerkily and eagerly, “my short-comings compared with the Austrians and especially Weierother. What accuracy, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what foresight of every possibility, every condition, of every minutest detail! No, my dear boy, anything more propitious than the circumstance we are placed in could not have been found, if one had arranged it purposely. The union of Austrian exactitude with Russian valour—what could you wish for more?”\\n\\n “So an attack has been finally decided upon?” said Bolkonsky.\\n\\n “And do you know, I fancy, Bonaparte really has lost his head. You know that a letter came from him to-day to the Emperor.” Dolgorukov smiled significantly.\\n\\n “You don\u0027t say so! What does he write?” asked Bolkonsky.\\n\\n “What can he write? Tradi-ri-di-ra—all simply to gain time. I tell you he\u0027s in our hands; that\u0027s the fact! But the most amusing part of it all,” he said, breaking all at once into a good-natured laugh, “is that they couldn\u0027t think how to address an answer to him. If not ‘consul,\u0027 and of course not ‘emperor,\u0027 it should be ‘general\u0027 Bonaparte, it seemed to me.”\\n\\n “But between not recognising him as emperor and calling him General Bonaparte, there\u0027s a difference,” said Bolkonsky.\\n\\n “That\u0027s just the point,” Dolgorukov interrupted quickly, laughing. “You know Bilibin, he\u0027s a very clever fellow; he suggested addressing it, ‘To the Usurper and Enemy of the Human Race,\u0027 ” Dolgorukov chuckled merrily.\\n\\n “And nothing more?” observed Bolkonsky.\\n\\n “But still it was Bilibin who found the suitable form of address in earnest. He\u0027s both shrewd and witty…”\\n\\n “How was it?”\\n\\n “To the Chief of the French Government: au chef du gouvernement fran?ais,” Dolgorukov said seriously and with satisfaction. “That was the right thing, wasn\u0027t it?”\\n\\n “It was all right, but he will dislike it extremely,” observed Bolkonsky.\\n\\n “Oh, extremely! My brother knows him; he\u0027s dined more than once with him—nowadays the emperor—in Paris, and used to tell me that he\u0027d never seen a subtler and more crafty diplomat; you know, a combination of French adroitness and the Italian actor-faculty! You know the anecdote about Bonaparte and Count Markov? Count Markov was the only person who knew how to treat him. You know the story of the handkerchief? It\u0027s a gem!” And the talkative Dolgorukov turning from Boris to Prince Andrey told the story of how Bonaparte, to test Markov, our ambassador, had purposely dropped his handkerchief before him, and had stood looking at him, probably expecting Markov to pick it up for him, and how Markov promptly dropped his own beside it, and had picked up his own without touching Bonaparte\u0027s.\\n\\n “Capital,” said Bolkonsky. “But, prince, I have come to you as a petitioner in behalf of this young friend. You see …” But before Prince Andrey could finish, an adjutant came into the room to summon Prince Dolgorukov to the Emperor.\\n\\n “Ah, how annoying!” said Dolgorukov, getting up hurriedly and shaking hands with Prince Andrey and Boris. “You know I shall be very glad to do all that depends on me both for you and for this charming young man.” Once more he shook hands with Boris with an expression of good-natured, genuine, heedless gaiety. “But you see … another time!”\\n\\n Boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers, as he felt himself to be at that instant. He was conscious here of being in contact with the springs that controlled all those vast movements of the masses, of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny, humble, and insignificant part. They followed Prince Dolgorukov out into the corridor and met (coming out of the door of the Tsar\u0027s room at which Dolgorukov went in) a short man in civilian dress with a shrewd face and a sharply projecting lower jaw, which, without spoiling his face, gave him a peculiar alertness and shiftiness of expression. This short man nodded to Dolgorukov, as if he were an intimate friend, and stared with an intently cold gaze at Prince Andrey, walking straight towards him and apparently expecting him to bow or move out of his way. Prince Andrey did neither; there was a vindictive look on his face, and the short young man turned away and walked at the side of the corridor.\\n\\n “Who\u0027s that?” asked Boris.\\n\\n “That\u0027s one of the most remarkable men—and the most unpleasant to me. The minister of foreign affairs, Prince Adam Tchartorizhsky.”\\n\\n “Those are the men,” added Bolkonsky with a sigh which he could not suppress, as they went out of the palace, “those are the men who decide the fates of nations.”\\n\\n Next day the troops set off on the march, and up to the time of the battle of Austerlitz, Boris did not succeed in seeing Bolkonsky or Dolgorukov again, and remained for a while in the Ismailov regiment.\\n\\n 是日，他在奥尔米茨没有碰见安德烈公爵。大本营和外交使团驻扎在奥尔米茨，两位皇帝随同侍从——廷臣和近臣均在此地居住。然而奥尔米茨的美景愈益加深了他想属于这个上层世界的心愿。\\n\\n 他不认识什么人，虽然他穿着讲究的近卫军军服，但是那些在街上来来往往的高级官员——廷臣和军人却坐着豪华的马车，佩戴着羽饰、绶带和勋章，他们比这个近卫军的小军官的地位看来要高得多，他们不仅不愿意，而且不会去承认他的存在。他在库图佐夫总司令的住宅打听博尔孔斯基，所有这些副官，甚至连勤务兵都轻蔑地望着他，仿佛向他示意；许多像他这样的军官都到这里来闲逛，他们真厌烦极了。尽管如此，或者毋宁说正因为如此，次日，即是十五日，午膳后他又前往奥尔米茨。当他走进库图佐夫的住宅时，他又打听博尔孔斯基。这时安德烈公爵在家，有人把鲍里斯带进一间大客厅，从前这里大概是跳舞的地方，而今这个大厅里摆着五张床、各种各样的家具、一张桌子、几把椅子和一架击弦古钢琴。一名穿波斯式长衫的副官坐在靠近房门的桌旁写字。另一名副官，面放红光的胖乎乎的涅斯维茨基枕着自己的手臂，躺在床上，正和一名坐在他身边的军官说笑话。第三名副官用击弦古钢琴弹奏维也纳圆舞曲，第四名副官靠在钢琴上随声和唱。博尔孔斯基不在场。这些先生们中谁也没有注意鲍里斯，他们并没有改变自己的姿态。有个人正在写字，鲍里斯向他打听情形，那人厌烦地把脸转向他，说博尔孔斯基正在执勤，如果要见他，就得从左边那道门进去，到接待室去。鲍里斯道一声谢，便朝接待室走去。这时有十来名军官和将军呆在接待室里。\\n\\n 当鲍里斯走进房间时，安德烈公爵正在听取那个胸前戴满了勋章的年老的将军的汇报，他鄙薄地眯缝起眼睛，这种特别谦虚而又疲倦的神态，很明显地表示：“如果不是我的职责所在，我连一分钟也不愿意和您交谈。”那位年老的将军几乎踮着脚尖，挺直着腰身，赤红的脸上流露着军人低三下四的表情，他向安德烈公爵禀告一件什么事。\\n\\n “很好，请等一下吧。”他用他想轻蔑地说话时所带有的法国口音操着俄国话对将军说道。当安德烈公爵看见鲍里斯以后，他就不再听取将军的汇报（那位将军现出苦苦哀求的样子跟在他背后跑，请他再听他汇报），他面露愉快的微笑，点点头，向鲍里斯转过脸来。\\n\\n 这时候鲍里斯已经明白，他从前所预见的正是这种情形：除开操典中明文规定、兵团中人人熟悉他也熟悉的等级服从制度和纪律而外，军队中还有另外一种更为实际的等级服从制度，这种制度能够迫使这个束紧腰带、面露紫色的将军恭敬地等候，而骑兵上尉安德烈公爵认为他可任意同准尉德鲁别茨科伊畅谈一番。鲍里斯比任何时候都更坚决，他拿定主意：今后不必遵照操典中明文规定的等级服从制度，而应遵照这种不成文的等级服从制度服务。如今他觉得，仅仅因为他经由介绍已经认识安德烈公爵，他就立刻凌驾于这位将军之上了，这位将军在其他场合，在前线都有可能迫使他这个近卫军准尉无地自容。安德烈公爵向他面前走去，一把握住他的手。\\n\\n “昨日您没有碰见我，十分抱歉。我整天价和德国人周旋。我同魏罗特尔曾去检查作战部署。德国人若要认真干起来，那就没完没了。”\\n\\n 鲍里斯微微一笑，仿佛他心中明白安德烈暗示的众人之事。不过魏罗特尔这个姓，甚至连“部署”这个词，他还是头一回才听说的。\\n\\n “啊，亲爱的，怎么样？您总是想当副官吗？我近来已经考虑了您的事情。”\\n\\n “是的！”鲍里斯说道，不知怎的不由地涨红了脸，“我想有求于总司令。关于我的事，库拉金给他的信中提到了，我所以想去求他，”他补充地说，仿佛是道歉似的，“只是因为我怕近卫军不会去参战。”\\n\\n “很好，很好！我们来商谈这件事吧，”安德烈公爵说道，“您只要让我把这位先生的情况向上级禀报一下，然后我就听任您的摆布了。”\\n\\n 当安德烈公爵去禀告那个面露紫色的将军的情况的时候，这位将军显然不赞同鲍里斯认为无明文规定的等级从属制度有益的观点，他双眼死死盯着那个妨碍他和副官将话说完的鲁莽的准尉，鲍里斯觉得不好意思。他转过脸来，不耐烦地等待安德烈公爵从总司令办公室回来。\\n\\n “我亲爱的，听我说，关于您的情况，我考虑过了，”当他们走进那间摆着击弦古钢琴的大厅的时候，安德烈公爵说道。“您用不着到总司令那里去了，”安德烈公爵说道，“他会对您说出一大堆客套话来，要您到他那里去吃午饭（就遵照那种等级服从制度供职而论，这算是不错的，鲍里斯想了想），可是到头来这不会有什么进展，我们这些人，副官和传令武官快要凑成一个营了。我们就这样办吧：我有个好友多尔戈鲁科夫公爵，他是一名副官总长，人品蛮好。尽管这一点您没法知道，但是问题却在于，库图佐夫随同他的司令部，还有我们这些人横竖不起什么作用。现在国王包办一切。我们就到多尔戈鲁科夫那里去吧，我也应当上他那儿去。关于您的事，我已经向他谈过了，那末，我们去看看他是否能够把您安插在他自己身边供职，或者在离太阳更近的什么地方谋个职位也行。”\\n\\n 当安德烈公爵有机会指导年轻人并且帮助他们在上流社会取得成就的时候，他就显得特别高兴了。因为高傲自负，他从来不会接受别人的帮助，但却在帮助别人的借口下，去接近那些获得成就并且吸引他的人。他很乐意一手包办鲍里斯的事，于是就和他一起到多尔戈鲁科夫公爵那里去了。\\n\\n 当他们走进二位皇帝及其亲信驻跸的奥尔米茨皇宫的时候，天色已经很晚了。\\n\\n 军事会议就是在这天举行的，军事参议院的全体议员和二位皇帝都参与会议。军事会议反对库图佐夫和施瓦岑贝格公爵两位老人的意见，决定立刻发动进攻，和波拿巴大战一场。安德烈公爵在鲍里斯陪伴下来到皇宫寻找多尔戈鲁科夫公爵的时候，军事会议刚刚结束了。大半营的人员为青年党今天胜利举行的军事会议而陶醉。一些行动迟慢的人员建议等待时机，暂不发动进攻，他们的呼声被人们异口同声地压住了，他们的论据已被进攻有利的无容置疑的证据所驳斥，会议上谈论的行将发生的战斗，无可置疑的凯旋，似乎不是未来的事，而是已经逝去的往事。我方已拥有各种有利的因素。雄厚的兵力，毋可置疑优越于波拿巴的兵力，已经集结于某一地区。两位皇帝亲临督阵。军心受到鼓舞，官兵急切地想投入战斗。指挥部队的奥国将军魏罗特尔对要采取军事行动的战略要地一目了然（旧年奥国军队碰巧在行将与法军交锋的战场举行过演习），对毗连前沿的地形也十分熟悉，而且都一一详载于地图。显然，波拿巴狂怒起来了，但却未采取任何行动。\\n\\n 多尔戈鲁科夫是个最热心地拥护进攻的人，他刚从委员会回来，虽然疲惫不堪，但是精神饱满，为赢得胜利而感到骄傲。安德烈公爵介绍了他所庇护的那个军官，但是多尔戈鲁科夫公爵却装出一副恭敬的样子，紧紧地握了一下鲍里斯的手，什么话也没有对他说。显然他没法忍耐下去，要把这时候使他最感兴趣的想法表白一下，他于是把脸转向安德烈公爵说起法国话来了。\\n\\n “嗬！我亲爱的，我们经受了怎样的战斗考验啊！但愿上帝保佑，日后的战事同样会胜利结束。不过，我亲爱的，”他若断若续地兴致勃勃地说，“我应当在奥国人面前，特别是在魏罗特尔面前承认我的过错。多么精细，多么周密，对地形多么熟悉，对一切可能性，一切条件，一切详情细节都要有先见之明啊！不过，我亲爱的，比我们目前更为有利的条件是无法故意虚构出来的。奥国人的精密和俄国人的勇敢相结合，所向无敌，您还要怎样呢？”\\n\\n “要是这样，发动进攻是最后的决定吗？”博尔孔斯基说道。\\n\\n “您是否知道，我亲爱的，我似乎觉得，波拿巴简直白费口舌。您知道，今日收到他给皇帝寄来的一封信。”多尔戈鲁科夫意味深长地微微一笑。\\n\\n “真有这么回事！他究竟写了什么呢？”博尔孔斯基问道。\\n\\n “他能写什么？还不是老生常谈，其目的只是赢得时间。我对您说，他落在我们手上了，这是真话！可是至为有趣的是，”他忽然和善地笑了起来，说道，“无论怎样也想不出用什么称呼给他回信。如果不把收件人称为执政官，当然也不能称为皇帝，我觉得可以把他称为波拿巴将军。”\\n\\n “但是，不承认波拿巴是皇帝和把他称为将军，这二者之间是有差别的。”博尔孔斯基说道。\\n\\n “问题就在那一点上，”多尔戈鲁科夫飞快地说，他一面发笑，一面打断他的话。“您可认识比利宾，他是个十分聪明的人，他建议这样称呼收件人：‘篡夺王位者和人类的公敌\u0027。”\\n\\n 多尔戈鲁科夫愉快地哈哈大笑。\\n\\n “再没有别的称呼吗？”博尔孔斯基说道。\\n\\n “比利宾毕竟想出了一个用于通信的头衔。他是一个既机智而又敏锐的人……”\\n\\n “可不是？什么头衔？”\\n\\n “法国政府首脑，Auchefdugouvernementfrancais，”多尔戈鲁科夫公爵严肃而又高兴地说。“很妙，是不是？”\\n\\n “很妙，他可真会很不乐意的。”博尔孔斯基说道。\\n\\n “噢，会很不乐意的！我的哥哥认识他，我哥哥不止一次在他（当今的皇上）那里用膳，那时候他们都在巴黎，我哥哥对我说，他没有见过比波拿巴更加机灵而且敏锐的外交家。您知道，他是一个既有法国人的灵活，又有意大利人的虚情假意的外交家！您知道他和马尔科夫伯爵之间的趣闻吗？只有马尔科夫伯爵一人擅长于同他打交道。您知道手绢的故事吗？妙不可言！”\\n\\n 喜欢谈话的多尔戈鲁科夫时而把脸转向鲍里斯，时而把脸转向安德烈公爵，叙述波拿巴试图考验一下我们的公使马尔科夫。波拿巴在他面前故意扔下一条手绢，他停步了，瞪着眼睛望着他，大概是等待马尔科夫帮忙，替他捡起手绢来，马尔科夫马上也在身边扔下一条自己的手绢，他捡起自己的手绢，没有去捡波拿巴的手绢。”\\n\\n “Charmant．”①博尔孔斯基说道，“公爵，请您听我说，我到您这里来是替这个年轻人求情的。您知不知道这是怎么回事吗？……” \\n\\n ①法语：妙不可言。\\n\\n “唉，多么懊恼！”多尔戈鲁科夫连忙站起来，握着安德烈公爵和鲍里斯的手，说，“您知道，我为您和这个可爱的年轻人办到由我决定的一切事情，我感到非常高兴。”他带着温和而诚挚、活泼而轻率的表情，再一次地握握鲍里斯的手。\\n\\n “可是你们都明白，下次再见吧！”\\n\\n 鲍里斯感到，这时候他正处在当权的上层人士的控制下，他想到要和这些当权人士接近，心里十分激动。他意识到他自己在这里要跟那指挥广大群众活动的发条打交道，他觉得他在自己的兵团里只是群众之中的一个唯命是从的微不足道的小零件。他们跟在多尔戈鲁科夫公爵后面来到走廊上，遇见一个从房门里走出来的（多尔戈鲁科夫正是走进国王的这道房门的）身材矮小的穿着便服的人，他长着一副显得聪颖的面孔，颌骨明显地向前突出，不过无损于他的面容，它反而使他赋有一种特别灵活的面部表情。这个身材矮小的人就像对自己人那样，对多尔戈鲁科夫点点头，他用他那冷淡的目光开始凝视安德烈公爵，一面径直地向他走去，看样子他在等待安德烈公爵向他鞠躬行礼，或者给他让路。安德烈公爵既没有鞠躬，也没有让路，他脸上流露着愤恨的表情，于是这个年轻人转过身去，紧靠着走廊边上走过去了。\\n\\n “他是谁呀？”鲍里斯问道。\\n\\n “他是个最出色的，但却是我最厌恶的人。他是外交大臣亚当·恰尔托里日斯基公爵。正是这些人，”他们走出皇宫时，博尔孔斯基禁不住叹了口气，说道，“正是这些人来决定各族人民命运的。”\\n\\n 翌日，部队出征了。在奥斯特利茨战役结束之前，鲍里斯既来不及访问博尔孔斯基，也来不及访问多尔戈鲁科夫，他在伊兹梅洛夫兵团还呆了一段时间。\\n\\n \\n\\n
