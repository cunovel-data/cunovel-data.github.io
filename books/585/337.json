{"id":41312,"no":337,"title":"Epilogue 1 Chapter 5","content":"NATASHA\u0027S MARRIAGE to Bezuhov, which took place in 1813, was the last happy event in the family of the old Rostovs. Count Ilya Andreivitch died the same year; and as is always the case, with the death of the father the family was broken up.\n The events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the flight from that city; the death of Prince Andrey and Natasha\u0027s despair; the death of Petya and the grief of the countess fell like one blow after another on the old count\u0027s head. He seemed not to understand, and to feel himself incapable of understanding, the significance of all these events, and figuratively speaking, bowed his old head to the storm, as though expecting and seeking fresh blows to make an end of him. By turns he seemed scared and distraught, and then unnaturally lively and active.\n Natasha\u0027s marriage for a time occupied him on its external side. He arranged dinners and suppers in honour of it, and obviously tried to be cheerful; but his cheerfulness was not infectious as in old days, but, on the contrary, aroused the commiseration of those who knew and liked him.\n After Pierre and his wife had left, he collapsed and began to complain of depression. A few days later he fell ill and took to his bed. In spite of the doctor\u0027s assurances, he knew from the first days of his illness that he would never get up again. For a whole fortnight the countess sat in a low chair by his pillow, never taking off her clothes. Every time she gave him his medicine, he mutely kissed her hand, weeping. On the last day, sobbing, he begged forgiveness of his wife, and of his absent son, too, for squandering their property, the chief sin that lay on his conscience. After receiving absolution and the last unction, he quietly died; and next day a crowd of acquaintances, come to pay the last debt of respect to the deceased, filled the Rostovs\u0027 hired lodgings. All those acquaintances, who had so often dined and danced in his house, and had so often laughed at his expense, were saying now with the same inward feeling of contrition and self-reproach, as though seeking to justify themselves: “Yes, whatever he may have been, he was a splendid man. One doesn\u0027t meet such men nowadays … And who has not his weaknesses?…”\n It was precisely when the count\u0027s fortunes were so irretrievably embroiled that he could not conceive how, in another year, it would end, that he suddenly died.\n Nikolay was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his father\u0027s death reached him. He at once applied for his discharge, and without waiting for it, obtained leave and went to Moscow. Within a month after the count\u0027s death the financial position had been made perfectly clear, astounding every one by the immense sum of various petty debts, the existence of which no one had suspected. The debts were more than double the assets of the estate.\n The friends and relations advised Nikolay to refuse to accept his inheritance. But Nikolay looked on such a refusal as a slur on the honoured memory of his father; and so he would not hear of such a course, and accepted the inheritance with the obligation of paying the debts.\n The creditors, who had so long been silent, held in check during the old count\u0027s lifetime by the vague but powerful influence of his easy good-nature, all beset Nikolay at once. There seemed, as so often happens, a sort of rivalry among them, which should get paid first; and the very people, such as Mitenka and others, who held promissory notes, not received in discharge of debts, but as presents, were now the most importunate of the creditors. They would give Nikolay no peace and no respite, and those who had shown pity for the old man, who was responsible for their losses (if they really had lost money by him), were now ruthless in their persecution of the young heir, who was obviously guiltless as far as they were concerned, and had voluntarily undertaken to pay them.\n Not one of the plans that Nikolay resorted to was successful: the estate was sold by auction at half its value, and half the debts remained still unpaid. Nikolay accepted a loan of thirty thousand roubles offered him by his brother-in-law Bezuhov; and paid that portion of the debts that he recognised as genuine obligations. And to avoid being thrown into prison for the remainder, as the creditors threatened, he once more entered the government service.\n To return to the army, where at the next promotion he would have been colonel, was out of the question, because his mother now clung to her son as her one hold on life. And so in spite of his disinclination to remain in Moscow, in the midst of a circle of acquaintances who had known him in former days, in spite of his distaste for the civil service, he accepted a civilian post in Moscow, and taking off his beloved uniform, established himself in a little lodging in Sivtsevoy Vrazhok with his mother and Sonya.\n Natasha and Pierre were living at this period in Petersburg, and had no very distinct idea of Nikolay\u0027s position. After having borrowed money from his brother-in-law, Nikolay did his utmost to conceal his poverty-stricken position from him. His situation was rendered the more difficult, as with his twelve hundred roubles of salary he had not only to keep himself, Sonya, and his mother, but to keep his mother in such a way that she would not be sensible of their poverty. The countess could not conceive of life being possible without the luxurious surroundings to which she had been accustomed from her childhood; and without any idea of its being difficult for her son, she was continually insisting on having a carriage, which they had not, to send for a friend, or an expensive delicacy for herself, or wine for her son, or money to buy a present, as a surprise for Natasha, for Sonya, or for Nikolay himself.\n Sonya kept house, waited on her aunt, read aloud to her, bore with her caprices and her secret dislike, and helped Nikolay to conceal from the old countess their poverty-stricken position. Nikolay felt himself under a debt of gratitude to Sonya that he could never repay, for all she did for his mother; he admired her patience and devotion, but he tried to keep himself aloof from her.\n In his heart he seemed to feel a sort of grudge against her for being too perfect, and for there being no fault to find with her. She had all the good qualities for which people are valued, but little of what would have made him love her. And he felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her. He had taken her at her word when she had written to him giving him his freedom, and now he behaved with her as though what had passed between them had been long, long ago forgotten, and could never under any circumstances be renewed.\n Nikolay\u0027s position was becoming worse and worse. His hope of laying by something out of his salary proved to be an idle dream. Far from saving anything, he was even running up some small debts to satisfy his mother\u0027s exigencies. There seemed no means of escape from his position. The idea of marrying a rich heiress, which his female relatives suggested, was repulsive to him. The only other solution of his difficulties—the death of his mother—never entered his head. He desired nothing, and hoped for nothing; and at the bottom of his heart he took a stern and gloomy satisfaction in the unrepining endurance of his position. He tried to avoid his old acquaintances, with their commiseration and their mortifying offers of assistance; shunned every sort of entertainment and amusement; and even at home did nothing but play patience with his mother, pace silently about the room, and smoke pipe after pipe. He seemed studiously to maintain in himself that gloomy temper, which alone enabled him to bear his position.\n 过去一年发生的几件事：莫斯科大火、从莫斯科逃难、安德烈公爵的死、娜塔莎的悲观失望、彼佳的死，以及老伯爵夫人的悲伤，——所有这一切，接二连三地给老伯爵以沉重打击。他似乎不了解也无法了解这些事件的意义，他垂下他那老年人的头，在精神上一蹶不振，好像正在期待和乞求新的打击，以结束自己的生命，他有时惊惶不安，不知所措，有时精神亢奋、雄心勃勃。\n 他为娜塔莎的婚礼表面上忙了一阵子。他预订午宴和晚宴的酒席，显然是想装出快乐的样子；但是他的快乐已不像以前那样感染人，反而使熟悉他和喜爱他的人觉得他可怜。\n 皮埃尔带着妻子走后，他开始沉默下来，同时抱怨，说他感到寂寞、烦闷。几天后，他病倒在床。从他生病时开始，虽经医生一再劝慰，他已自知他再也起不来了。伯爵夫人和衣坐在安乐椅上，在他床头守了两个星期。每次夫人给他递药，他总是抽泣，默默地吻她的手。临终那天，他痛哭失声，请求妻子和不在跟前的儿子宽恕他的主要罪过——荡尽家产。领过圣餐、行过涂敷圣油仪式后，他平静地死去了。第二天，在罗斯托夫家所租用的住宅内，挤满了亲朋好友，向死者的遗体告别。所有这些常在他家吃饭、跳舞，并且时常嘲笑他的人们，现在都怀着悔恨和内疚的心情，仿佛向谁作自我辩解似地说：“不管怎么说，他是一个极好的人。如今再也遇不到这样的人了……再说，为人在世，谁能没有一点缺点呢？……”\n 伯爵此时死去，是在他的经济情况步入山穷水尽之地，已无法想象是否能再熬上一年的时候。正是在这种的情况下，他突然死了。\n 尼古拉接到父亲去世的噩耗时，正随着俄国军队驻在巴黎。他立刻提出辞职，不等批准，就请假回莫斯科。伯爵死后一个月，家里的经济情况就弄清楚了。虽然谁都知道伯爵负债累累，这些零星债务的数额之大令人吃惊。负债的总数比家产大上一倍。\n 亲友们劝尼古拉不要接受遗产。但是尼古拉认为拒绝接受遗产是孝子对亡父的神圣纪念的亵渎，因此没有听取劝告，毅然承担起还债的义务。\n 伯爵在世时，由于他生性善良，人缘较好，债主们慑于他那种难以捉摸的强大影响，以前一直不好开口，如今却蜂拥而至上门要债。就像一般情况那样，债主们争着首先得到债款，像米坚卡等持有赠予期票的人，现在就成为讨债最急的人了。那些原来可怜老伯爵（似乎他使他们受到损失）（就算受过损失）的人，现在却不肯放宽尼古拉的还债期限，也不给他喘息的机会，现在也毫不留情地向那个显然没欠他们帐却自愿承担债务的年轻人逼债。\n 尼古拉所设想的周转办法没有一种获得成功，地产以半价卖出去了，但仍有一半债务未能偿还。尼古拉接受了妹夫别祖霍夫借给他的三万卢布，以偿还他认为欠的是现款的真正的债款，他为了不致为余下的债务而坐牢（债主们以此威胁他），他只有重新去任公职。\n 虽然重返军队可以补上团长的空缺，但他不能去，因为母亲现在把儿子当作她生活中唯一的倚靠，抓住他不放。因此，尽管他不愿留在莫斯科熟人中间，尽管他讨厌文职工作，他还是在莫斯科找了一个文官职务。这样，他就脱下心爱的军服，同母亲和索尼娅搬到西夫采夫·弗拉若克区一所小住宅里。\n 娜塔莎和皮埃尔这时住在彼得堡，不太了解尼古拉的困境。尼古拉向妹夫借了钱，但竭力掩饰他的窘境，尼古拉的处境特别为难，因为他要用一千二百卢布养活自己、索尼娅和母亲，而且还不能让母亲知道他们家已十分穷困。伯爵夫人简直无法想象如果缺乏她从小过惯的奢侈环境怎样生活下去，她不知道儿子有多艰难，还不断提出各种要求：时而要马车去接熟人（此时他们家已没有马车了），时而为自己要佳肴美食或者为儿子要美酒，时而要钱为娜塔莎、索尼雅和尼古拉买一件他们意想不到的高级礼物。\n 索尼娅料理家务，侍奉姑母，念书给她听，忍受她的任性和内心中对她的嫌恶，帮助尼古拉向老公爵夫人隐瞒他们经济上的窘迫。尼古拉因索尼娅尽心尽力照顾母亲，对她感激不尽。他赞赏她的耐心和忠诚，却竭力疏远她。\n 他在心里责怪她，好像就因为她十分完美，几乎无法责怪她，她有一切为人们所珍惜的品德，可是就缺少使他爱的东西。他觉得他越是赞赏她的为人、她的品德，就越是爱不起来。她过去在信中写到她给他自由的诺言，现在他对她的态度，就像过去的一切老早老早就给忘记了，再也无法挽回了。\n 尼古拉的处境每况愈下。从薪金里攒点钱，显然是不切实际的幻想。他不仅攒不了钱，而且为了满足母亲的要求，又借了几笔小债。他找不到摆脱困境的办法。亲戚们劝他娶一位有钱的姑娘，他颇为反感。摆脱困境的另一条出路——母亲去世，他从来没有想到过，他没有任何心愿，不抱任何希望，在逆境中不发牢骚，没有怨言，而在内心深处却享受一种忧郁而严峻的欢乐。他竭力避开过去的熟人，避开他们的同情和令人屈辱的帮助。他摆脱一切娱乐消遣，甚至在家里也不做什么，只和母亲玩玩牌，在室内默默地踱步，一袋接着一袋地吸烟。他似乎竭力保持忧郁的心情，仿佛只有这样才能忍受他的处境。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3635.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
