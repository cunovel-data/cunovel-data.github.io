{"id":41105,"no":130,"title":"Book 7 Chapter 2","content":"IN THE EARLY PART of his time at home Nikolay was serious and even dull. He was worried by the necessity of meddling in the stupid business matters which his mother had sent for him to look after. To be rid of this burden as soon as possible, on the third day after his return, he marched angrily off, making no reply to inquiries where he was going, with scowling brows entered Mitenka\u0027s lodge, and demanded from him an account in full. What he meant by an account in full, Nikolay knew even less than the panic-stricken and bewildered Mitenka. The conversation and Mitenka\u0027s accounts did not last long. The village elder, the deputy, and the village clerk, waiting in the entry of the lodge, heard with awe and delight at first the booming and snapping of the young count\u0027s voice in a constantly ascending scale, then terrible words of abuse, flung one after another. “Robber! Ungrateful brute!…I\u0027ll thrash the dog!…not papa to deal with…plundering us…” and so on. Then, with no less awe and delight, these persons saw the young count, with a red face and bloodshot eyes, dragging Mitenka out by the collar, kicking him with great dexterity at every appropriate moment between his words, and shouting: “Away with you! Never let me set eyes on you, blackguard!” Mitenka flew head first down six steps and ran to the shrubbery. This shrubbery was well known as a haven of refuge for delinquents at Otradnoe. Mitenka had, on coming home drunk from the town, himself hidden in the shrubbery, and many of the residents of Otradnoe had been indebted to the saving power of the shrubbery when anxious to conceal themselves from Mitenka. Mitenka\u0027s wife and sister-in-law, with frightened faces, peeped into the passage from the door of their room, where was a bright samovar boiling, and the bailiff\u0027s high bedstead stood under a quilted patchwork coverlet. The young count walked by, treading resolutely and breathing hard, taking no notice of them, and went into the house. The countess heard at once through her maids of what had been happening in the lodge, and on one side was comforted by the reflection that now their position would be sure to improve, though on the other hand she was uneasy as to the effect of the scene on her son. She went several times on tiptoe to his door, and listened as he lighted one pipe after another. The next day the old count drew his son on one side, and, with a timid smile, said to him, “But you know, my dear boy, you had no reason to be so angry. Mitenka has told me all about it.” “I knew,” thought Nikolay, “that I should never make head or tail of anything in this crazy world.” “You were angry at his not having put down these seven hundred and eight roubles. But you see they were carried forward by double entry, and you didn\u0027t look at the next page.” “Papa, he\u0027s a blackguard and a thief, I am certain. And what I have done, I have done. But if you don\u0027t wish it, I will say nothing to him.” “No, my dear boy!” (The old count was confused. He was conscious that he had mismanaged his wife\u0027s estate and had wronged his children, but he had no notion how to rectify the position.) “No, I beg you to go into things. I am old. I…” “No, papa, forgive me if I have done what you dislike. I know less about it than you do.” “Damn them all, these peasants, and money matters and double entries,” he thought. “I used once to understand scoring at cards, but bookkeeping by the double entry is quite beyond me,” he said to himself, and from that time he did not meddle further with the management of the family affairs. But one day the countess called her son into her room, told him that she had a promissory note from Anna Mihalovna for two thousand roubles, and asked Nikolay what he thought it best to do about it. “Well,” answered Nikolay, “you say that it rests with me. I don\u0027t like Anna Mihalovna, and I don\u0027t like Boris, but they were our friends, and they were poor. So that\u0027s what I would do!” and he tore up the note and by so doing made the countess sob with tears of joy. After this, young Rostov took no further part in business of any sort, but devoted himself with passionate interest to everything to do with the chase, which was kept up on a great scale on the old count\u0027s estate. “强盗啊！忘恩负义的坏蛋！……砍死这条狗……不跟爸爸那样……你偷光了……”等等骂人的话。 然后这些人仍然带着喜悦和恐惧的样子看见年轻的伯爵面红耳赤，眼睛里充血，一把抓住米坚卡的后脖颈，把他拖出来，在咒骂之间，他很轻巧地用腿和膝头顶住他的屁股，用力推他往前走，大声吆喝：“滚开，坏蛋！你这个鬼家伙不要待在这儿吧！” 米坚卡拼命地从六级台阶飞奔下来，跑进了花坛。（这个花坛是奥特拉德诺耶的罪犯们所熟悉的避难的地方。那个喝得烂醉从城里走回来的米坚卡本人就是躲在这个花坛里的，许多躲避米坚卡的奥特拉德诺耶的居民，都熟谙这个花坛的庇护效力。） 米坚卡的妻子和几个小姨子露出惶恐的神态从房门口探出身子向门斗张望，一只精美的茶炊正在沸腾，管事人的一张高床摆在那间房里，床上铺着用那短短的碎布缝缀的、绗过的棉被。 年轻的伯爵上气不接下气，迈着坚定的脚步从她们身旁经过，没有注意她们，向住宅走去。 伯爵夫人从几个婢女那儿立刻打听到耳房里发生的事，一方面，他们目前的景况应当好转，因而放下心来；另一方面，她非常担心儿子经受不起劳累，因而惴惴不安。她接连几次踮着脚尖走到他门前，听见他装一袋烟，又装一袋烟，不停地抽烟。 第二天，老伯爵把他儿子喊到一边，含着胆怯的微笑对他说： “我的心肝，你知不知道，你无缘无故地发了一阵火！米坚卡把什么都讲给我听了。” “我知道，”尼古拉想了想，“在这个愚昧的世界里，无论什么事我永远都不明白。” “他没有把这七百卢布记在帐上，你就生他的气了。要知道，他把这七百卢布记在转欠页上，而另外一页你就没有看了。” “爸爸，我知道他是个坏蛋，小偷儿。我干过了，就算干过了。如果您不希望我这样做，我就不再跟他说什么了。” “不，我的心肝，（伯爵也感到困窘不安。他觉得，他是他妻子的地产的蹩脚主管，他对不起他自己的儿女，可是他并不知道，要怎样去加以改进。）不过，我请你来管理家业，我太老了，而且……” “不，爸爸，如果我做了使您不愉快的事，就请您原谅，我没有您那样内行。” “这些农夫、金钱、转欠页上的帐目统统见鬼去吧，”他想道，“我早就懂得，怎样折起纸牌的一角押上赌注，可是过页转帐的事，我一点也不懂得。”他自言自语地说，从那时起他再也不过问家业了。只是有一回，伯爵夫人把儿子喊到面前，告诉他，她有一张安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜的二千卢布的期票，她问尼古拉，他想怎么办。 “原来是这么回事，”尼古拉回答，“您对我说，这件事取决于我，我不喜欢安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜，也不喜欢鲍里斯，不过他们和我们要好，而且他们的生活很贫苦。那就这么办好了！”于是他撕了这张期票，他这种做法使得老伯爵夫人含着欣喜的泪水大哭了一顿。在此以后，年轻的伯爵不再过问任何家事了，他兴致勃勃地开始干一件对他说来还是新鲜的事情——犬猎，老伯爵正以巨大的规模从事犬猎。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3428.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
