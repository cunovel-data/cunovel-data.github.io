{"id":41086,"no":111,"title":"Book 6 Chapter 9","content":"AT THAT TIME, as always indeed, the exalted society that met at court and at the great balls was split up into several circles, each of which had its special tone. The largest among them was the French circle—supporting the Napoleonic alliance—the circle of Count Rumyantsev and Caulaincourt. In this circle Ellen took a leading position, as soon as she had established herself in her husband\u0027s house in Petersburg. She received the members of the French embassy, and a great number of people, noted for their wit and their politeness, and belonging to that political section.\n Ellen had been at Erfurt at the time of the famous meeting of the Emperors; and had there formed close ties with all the notable figures in Europe belonging to the Napoleonic circle. In Erfurt she had been brilliantly successful. Napoleon himself, seeing her at the theatre, had asked who she was, and admired her beauty. Her triumphs in the character of a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise Pierre, for with years she had become even more beautiful than before. But what did surprise him was that during the last two years his wife had succeeded in gaining a reputation as “a charming woman, as witty as she is beautiful,” as was said of her. The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her letters of eight pages. Bilibin treasured up his mots to utter them for the first time before Countess Bezuhov. To be received in Countess Bezuhov\u0027s salon was looked upon as a certificate of intellect. Young men read up subjects before one of Ellen\u0027s soirées, so as to be able to talk of something in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy, and even ambassadors, confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that Ellen was in a way a power. It was with a strange feeling of perplexity and alarm that Pierre, who knew she was very stupid, sometimes at her dinners and soirées, listened to conversation about politics, poetry, and philosophy. At these soirées he experienced a sensation such as a conjuror must feel who expects every moment that his trick will be discovered. But either because stupidity was just what was needed for the successful management of such a salon, or because those who were deceived took pleasure in the deception, the cheat was not discovered, and the reputation of “a charming woman” clung so persistently to Elena Vassilyevna Bezuhov, that she could utter the vulgarest and stupidest speeches, and every one was just as enthusiastic over every word, and eagerly found in it a profound meaning of which she did not dream herself.\n Pierre was exactly the husband needed by this brilliant society woman. He was that absent-minded, eccentric, grand seigneur of a husband, who got in nobody\u0027s way and far from spoiling the general impression of the highest tone in her drawing-room, formed by his contrast with his wife\u0027s elegance and tact an advantageous foil to her. Pierre\u0027s continual concentration on immaterial interests during the last two years, and his genuine contempt for everything else, gave him in his wife\u0027s circle, which did not interest him, that tone of unconcern, indifference, and benevolence towards all alike, which cannot be acquired artificially, and for that reason commands involuntary respect. He entered his wife\u0027s drawing-room as though it were a theatre, was acquainted with every one, equally affable to all, and to all equally indifferent. Sometimes he took part in conversation on some subject that interested him, and then, without any consideration whether the “gentlemen of the embassy” were present or not, he mumbled out his opinions, which were by no means always in harmony with the received catch-words of the time. But the public estimate of the eccentric husband of “the most distinguished woman in Petersburg” was now so well established that no one took his sallies seriously.\n Among the numerous young men, who were daily to be seen in Ellen\u0027s house, Boris Drubetskoy, who had by now achieved marked success in the service, was, after Ellen\u0027s return from Erfurt, the most intimate friend of the Bezuhov household. Ellen used to call him “mon page,” and treated him like a child. Her smile for him was the same smile she bestowed on all, but it was sometimes distasteful to Pierre to see that smile. Boris behaved to Pierre with a marked, dignified, and mournful respectfulness. This shade of respectfulness too disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so much three years before from the mortification caused him by his wife, that now he secured himself from all possibility of similar mortification; in the first place, by being his wife\u0027s husband only in name, and secondly, by not allowing himself to suspect anything. “No, now she has become a blue-stocking, she has renounced for ever her former errors,” he said to himself. “There has never been an instance of a blue-stocking giving way to tender passions,” he repeated to himself; a maxim he had picked up somewhere and implicitly believed. But, strange to say, the presence of Boris in his wife\u0027s drawing-room (and he was almost always there) had a physical effect on Pierre; it seemed to make all his limbs contract, and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of his movement.\n “Such a strange antipathy,” thought Pierre; “and at one time I really liked him very much.”\n In the eyes of the world, Pierre was a great lord, the rather blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife; a clever eccentric, who did nothing but who was no trouble to any one, a good-natured, capital fellow. In Pierre\u0027s soul all this while a complex and laborious process of inner development was going on that revealed much to him and led him to many spiritual doubts and joys.\n 适值闻名于世的两国皇帝的会晤期间，海伦在埃尔富特，她在那里就和欧洲所有亲拿破仑的著名人物建立了人际关系，从那里带来了一份交情。她在埃尔富特大受欢迎。拿破仑本人在剧院里发现她之后，便问她是谁，并且对她的美貌给予高度评价。她这个姿色优美而文雅的妇女取得的成功不会使皮埃尔感到惊奇，因为随着时间的推移，她比从前变得更美丽了。但是使他感到惊奇的是，在这两年之内她的妻子已享有名声“d\u0027une　femme　charmante，aussi　spirituelle　que　belle”②。大名鼎鼎的prince　de　ligne③用八页纸给她写长信。比利宾正在搜集mots④，目的是要在别祖霍夫伯爵夫人露面时头一次把它说出来。在别祖霍夫伯爵夫人客厅中受到招待，被认为是聪明的证明；在海伦举办晚会前，一些年轻人阅读一本本的书，目的是要在她的客厅中有话可谈；大使馆的秘书们，甚至公使们都把外交上的秘密告诉她，因此海伦在某种程度上是个颇有势力的女人。皮埃尔知道，她非常愚昧，他有时怀有困惑和恐惧的古怪感觉去出席她的晚会和宴会，人们在那里经常谈论政治、诗歌和哲学。在这些晚会上他常常怀有那样的感觉，就像魔术家每次登台总会预料他的骗术眼看要被人揭穿时他理应体会到的那种感觉。然而，是否是因为主持这种客厅活动正需要愚昧无知，或是因为被欺骗的人们自己要在这种骗术中寻找乐趣，欺骗是不会被人揭穿的，海伦·瓦西里耶夫娜·别祖霍娃这个d\u0027une　femme　charmante　et　spirituelle⑤的名声不可动摇地确立起来了，以致她可以说些最庸俗而愚蠢的话，大家还是会赞赏她的每句话，并且从中找到连她自己也意料不到的深刻的涵义。 \n ①科兰库尔（1773～1827），法国贵族，侯爵，拿破仑的追随者，1807～1811年间，驻彼得堡公使。\n ②法语：多么聪明，多么迷人的可爱的女人。\n ③法语：德利涅公爵。\n ④法语：俏皮话。\n ⑤法语：既可爱而又聪明的女人。\n ①法语：贵族大老爷。\n ②法语：大使馆的先生们。\n ③法语：彼得堡的至为杰出的妇女。\n ④法语：认真地。\n “不，她现在已经变成了ba　bleu②，永远抛弃了从前的风流韵事，”他自言自语地说，“女学究醉心于风流韵事，尚无前例。”他自言自语地重复一条不知从哪里摘出的，使他坚信不疑的行为准则。但是，真奇怪，鲍里斯在他妻子客厅中的露面（他几乎经常在那儿露面）对皮埃尔的身体产生了一种影响，他的四肢仿佛被捆绑起来，他的动作被阻碍，变得不自然，也不灵活。 \n ①法语：我的少年侍从官。\n ②法语：我的少年女学究。\n 在上流社会人士的心目中，皮埃尔是个大老爷，是遐迩闻名的妻子的略嫌盲目而且可笑的丈夫，聪颖的怪人，又是个无所事事，但不伤害任何人的大好人。在这段时间里皮埃尔的内心经历着一个复杂而艰苦的智力发展过程，这使他获得许多启示，并且使他产生许多疑惑和快感。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3409.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
