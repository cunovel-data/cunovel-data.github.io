{"id":40982,"no":7,"title":"Book 1 Chapter 7","content":"PRINCE VASSILY kept the promise he had made at Anna Pavlovna\u0027s soirée to Princess Drubetskoy, who had petitioned him in favour of her only son Boris. His case had been laid before the Emperor, and though it was not to be a precedent for others, he received a commission as sub-lieutenant in the Guards of the Semenovsky regiment. But the post of an adjutant or attaché in Kutuzov\u0027s service was not to be obtained for Boris by all Anna Mihalovna\u0027s efforts and entreaties. Shortly after the gathering at Anna Pavlovna\u0027s, Anna Mihalovna went back to Moscow to her rich relatives the Rostovs, with whom she stayed in Moscow. It was with these relations that her adored Borinka, who had only recently entered a regiment of the line, and was now at once transferred to the Guards as a sub-lieutenant, had been educated from childhood and had lived for years. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the 10th of August, and her son, who was remaining in Moscow to get his equipment, was to overtake them on the road to Radzivilov.\\n\\n The Rostovs were keeping the name-day of the mother and the younger daughter, both called Natalya. Ever since the morning, coaches with six horses had been incessantly driving to and from the Countess Rostov\u0027s big house in Povarsky, which was known to all Moscow. The countess and her handsomest eldest daughter were sitting in the drawing-room with their visitors, who came in continual succession to present their congratulations to the elder lady.\\n\\n The countess was a woman with a thin face of Oriental cast, forty-five years old, and obviously exhausted by child-bearing. She had had twelve children. The deliberate slowness of her movements and conversation, arising from weak health, gave her an air of dignity which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mihalovna Drubetskoy, as an intimate friend of the family, sat with them assisting in the work of receiving and entertaining their guests. The younger members of the family were in the back rooms, not seeing fit to take part in receiving visitors. The count met his visitors and escorted them to the door, inviting all of them to dinner.\\n\\n “I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher” or “ma chère,” he said to every one without exception (making not the slightest distinction between persons of higher or of lower standing than his own), “for myself and my two dear ones whose name-day we are keeping. Mind you come to dinner. I shall be offended if you don\u0027t, mon cher. I beg you most sincerely from all the family, my dear.” These words, invariably accompanied by the same expression on his full, good-humoured, clean-shaven face, and the same warm pressure of the hand, and repeated short bows, he said to all without exception or variation. When he had escorted one guest to the hall, the count returned to the gentleman or lady who was still in the drawing-room. Moving up a chair, and with the air of a man fond of society and at home in it, he would sit down, his legs jauntily apart, and his hands on his knees, and sway to and fro with dignity as he proffered surmises upon the weather, gave advice about health, sometimes in Russian, sometimes in very bad but complacent French. Then again he would get up, and with the air of a man weary but resolute in the performance of his duty, he would escort guests out, stroking up his grey hair over his bald patch, and again he would urge them to come to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the hall, he would pass through the conservatory and the butler\u0027s room into a big room with a marble floor, where they were setting a table for eighty guests; and looking at the waiters who were bringing in the silver and china, setting out tables and unfolding damask tablecloths, he would call up Dmitry Vassilyevitch, a young man of good family, who performed the duties of a steward in his household, and would say: “Now then, Mitenka, mind everything\u0027s right. That\u0027s it, that\u0027s it,” he would say, looking round with pleasure at the immense table opened out to its full extent; “the great thing is the service. So, so.” …And he went off again with a sigh of satisfaction to the drawing-room.\\n\\n “Marya Lvovna Karagin and her daughter,” the countess\u0027s huge footman announced in a deep bass at the drawing-room door. The countess thought a moment, and took a pinch from a golden snuff-box with her husband\u0027s portrait on it.\\n\\n “I\u0027m worn out with these callers,” she said; “well, this is the last one I\u0027ll see. She\u0027s so affected. Show her up,” she said in a dejected tone, as though she were saying, “Very well, finish me off entirely!”\\n\\n A tall, stout, haughty-looking lady and her round-faced, smiling daughter walked with rustling skirts into the drawing-room.\\n\\n “Dear countess, it is such a long time…she has been laid up, poor child…at the Razumovskys\u0027 ball, and the Countess Apraxin…I was so glad,” feminine voices chattered briskly, interrupting one another and mingling with the sound of rustling skirts and the scraping of chairs. Conversation began of the sort which is kept up just long enough for the caller to get up at the first pause, rustling her skirts and with a murmur of “I am so charmed; mamma\u0027s health…and the Countess Apraxin…” walk out again with the same rustle to the hall to put on cloak or overcoat and drive away. The conversation touched on the chief items of news in the town, on the illness of the wealthy old Count Bezuhov, a man who had been renowned for his personal beauty in the days of Catherine, and on his illegitimate son, Pierre, who had behaved so improperly at a soirée at Anna Pavlovna\u0027s. “I am very sorry for the poor count,” declared the visitor; “his health in such a precarious state, and now this distress caused him by his son; it will be the death of him!”\\n\\n “Why, what has happened?” asked the countess, as though she did not know what was meant, though she had heard about the cause of Count Bezuhov\u0027s distress fifteen times already.\\n\\n “This is what comes of modern education! When he was abroad,” the visitor pursued, “this young man was left to his own devices, and now in Petersburg, they say, he has been doing such atrocious things that he has been sent away under police escort.”\\n\\n “Really!” said the countess.\\n\\n “He has made a bad choice of his companions,” put in Princess Anna Mihalovna. “Prince Vassily\u0027s son—he and a young man called Dolohov, they say—God only knows the dreadful things they\u0027ve been doing. And both have suffered for it. Dolohov has been degraded to the rank of a common soldier, while Bezuhov\u0027s son has been banished to Moscow. As to Anatole Kuragin…his father managed to hush it up somehow. But he has been sent out of Petersburg too.”\\n\\n “Why, what did they do?” asked the countess.\\n\\n “They\u0027re perfect ruffians, especially Dolohov,” said the visitor. “He\u0027s the son of Marya Ivanovna Dolohov, such a worthy woman, you know, but there! Only fancy, the three of them had got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage with them, and were taking it to some actress\u0027s. The police ran up to stop them. They took the police officer, tied him back to back to the bear, and dropped the bear into the Moika: the bear swam with the police officer on him.”\\n\\n “A pretty figure he must have looked, ma chère,” cried the count, helpless with laughter.\\n\\n “Ah, such a horror! What is there to laugh at in it, count?”\\n\\n But the ladies could not help laughing at it themselves.\\n\\n “It was all they could do to rescue the unlucky man,” the visitor went on. “And that\u0027s the intellectual sort of amusement the son of Count Kirill Vladimirovitch Bezuhov indulges in!” she added. “And people said he was so well educated and clever. That\u0027s how foreign education turns out. I hope no one will receive him here, in spite of his great wealth. They tried to introduce him to me. I gave an absolute refusal: I have daughters.”\\n\\n “What makes you say the young man is so wealthy?” asked the countess, turning away from the girls, who at once looked as though they did not hear. “He has none but illegitimate children. I believe that…Pierre too is illegitimate.”\\n\\n The visitor waved her hand. “He has a score of them, I suppose.”\\n\\n Princess Anna Mihalovna interposed, obviously wishing to show her connections and intimate knowledge with every detail in society.\\n\\n “This is how the matter stands,” she said meaningly, speaking in a half whisper. “Count Kirill Vladimirovitch\u0027s reputation we all know.…He has lost count of his own children, indeed, but this Pierre was his favourite.”\\n\\n “How handsome the old man was,” said the countess, “only last year! A finer-looking man I have never seen.”\\n\\n “Now he\u0027s very much altered,” said Anna Mihalovna. “Well, I was just saying,” she went on, “the direct heir to all the property is Prince Vassily through his wife, but the father is very fond of Pierre, has taken trouble over his education, and he has written to the Emperor…so that no one can tell, if he dies (he\u0027s so ill that it\u0027s expected any moment, and Lorrain has come from Petersburg), whom that immense property will come to, Pierre or Prince Vassily. Forty thousand serfs and millions of money. I know this for a fact, for Prince Vassily himself told me so. And indeed Kirill Vladimirovitch happens to be a third cousin of mine on my mother\u0027s side, and he\u0027s Boris\u0027s godfather too,” she added, apparently attaching no importance to this circumstance.\\n\\n “Prince Vassily arrived in Moscow yesterday. He\u0027s coming on some inspection business, so I was told,” said the visitor.\\n\\n “Yes, between ourselves,” said the princess, “that\u0027s a pretext; he has come simply to see Prince Kirill Vladimirovitch, hearing he was in such a serious state.”\\n\\n “But, really, ma chère, that was a capital piece of fun,” said the count; and seeing that the elder visitor did not hear him, he turned to the young ladies. “A funny figure the police officer must have looked; I can just fancy him.”\\n\\n And showing how the police officer waved his arms about, he went off again into his rich bass laugh, his sides shaking with mirth, as people do laugh who always eat and, still more, drink well. “Then do, please, come to dinner with us,” he said.\\n\\n 罗斯托夫家中有两个叫做娜塔莉娅的女人——母亲和小女儿——过命名日。从清早起，波瓦尔大街上一栋莫斯科全市闻名的叫做罗斯托娃的伯爵夫人的大楼前面，装载着贺客的车辆就来回奔走，川流不息。伯爵夫人和漂亮的大女儿坐在客厅里接待来宾，送走了一批宾客，又迎来了另一批宾客，不停地应接。\\n\\n 这位伯爵夫人长着一副东方型的瘦削的脸盘，四十五岁上下，她为儿女所劳累（有十二个儿女），身体显得虚弱。由于体弱，她的动作和言谈都很迟缓，这却赋予她一种令人肃然起敬的、威严的风貌。叫做安娜·米哈伊洛莫娜·德鲁别茨卡娅的公爵夫人就像他们家里人一样，也坐在那儿，帮助和应酬宾客。年轻人认为不必参与接待事宜，都呆在后面的几个房间里。伯爵迎送着宾客，邀请全部宾客出席午宴。\\n\\n “十分、十分感激您machère或moncher①，（他对待一切人，无论地位高于他，抑或低于他，都毫无例外地、毫无细微差别地称machère或moncher），我个人代替两个过命名日的亲人感激您。请费神，来用午膳。您不要让我生气，moncher。我代表全家人诚挚地邀请您，machère。”他毫无例外地，一字不变地对一切人都说这番话，他那肥胖的、愉快的、常常刮得很光的脸上现出同样的神态，他同样地紧握来宾的手，频频地鞠躬致意。送走一位宾客后，伯爵回到那些尚在客厅未退席的男女宾客面前，他把安乐椅移到近旁，显露出热爱生活、善于生活的人所固有的样子，豪放地摊开两腿，两手搁在膝盖上，意味深长地摇摇摆摆，他预测天气，请教保健的秘诀，有时讲俄国话，有时讲很差劲的、但自以为道地的法国话，后来又现出极度困倦、但却竭尽义务的人所独具的样子去送宾客，一面弄平秃头上稀疏的斑发，又请宾客来用午膳。有时候，他从接待室回来，顺路穿过花斋和堂馆休息室走进大理石大厅，大厅里已经摆好备有八十份餐具的筵席，他望着堂倌拿来银器和瓷器，摆筵席、铺上织花桌布，并把出身于贵族的管家德米特里·瓦西里耶维奇喊到身边来，说道：\\n\\n “喂，喂，米佳，你要注意，把一切布置停妥。好，好，” \\n\\n ①法语：亲爱的女客，亲爱的男客。\\n\\n “玛丽亚·利洛夫娜·卡拉金娜和她的女儿到了！”伯爵夫人的身材魁梧的随从的仆人走进客厅门，用那低沉的嗓音禀告。伯爵夫人思忖了一会，闻了闻镶有丈夫肖像的金质鼻烟壶。\\n\\n “这些接客的事情把我折磨得难受，”她说道，“哦，我来接待她这最后一个女客。她真拘礼，请吧，”她用忧悒的嗓音对仆人说，内心好像是这样说：“哎呀！让你们这些人置我于死命吧！”\\n\\n 一个身段高大、肥胖、样子骄傲的太太和她的圆脸蛋的、微露笑容的女儿，衣裙沙沙作响，走进客厅来。\\n\\n “Chèrecomtesse，ilyasilongtemps…elleaéléalitéelapauvreenfant…aubaldesRazoumowsky…etlacomtesseApraksine…j\u0027aiétésiheureuse……①，听见妇女们互相打断话头、闹哄哄的谈话声，谈话声和连衣裙的沙沙声、移动椅子的响声连成一片了。这场谈话开始了，谈话在头次停顿的时候正好有人站起来，把那连衣裙弄得沙沙作响，有人说：“Jeauisbiencharmée，lasantédlemaman…etlacomtesseApraksine．”②连衣裙又给弄得沙沙作响，有人朝接待室走去，穿上皮袄或披起斗篷，就离开了。谈话中提到当时市内的首要新闻——遐尔闻名的富豪和叶卡捷琳娜女皇当政时的美男子老别祖霍夫伯爵的病情和他的私生子皮埃尔，此人在安娜·帕夫洛夫娜·舍列尔举办的晚会上行为不轨，有失体统。 \\n\\n ①法语：伯爵夫人……已经这样久了……可怜的女孩，她害病了……在拉祖莫夫斯基家的舞会上……伯爵夫人阿普拉克辛娜……我简直高兴极了……\\n\\n ①法语：我非常、非常高兴……妈妈很健康……伯爵夫人阿普拉克辛娜。\\n\\n “是怎么回事？”伯爵夫人问道，好像她不知道那女客在说什么事，不过她已有十五次左右听过关于别祖霍夫伯爵感到伤心的原因。\\n\\n “这就是现在的教育啊！”一位女客说，“现在国外时，这个年轻人就听天由命，放任自流，而今他在彼得堡，据说，他干了不少令人胆寒的事，已经通过警察局把他从这里驱逐出去了。”\\n\\n “您看，真有其事！”伯爵夫人说道。\\n\\n “他很愚蠢地择交，”安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜插嘴了，“瓦西里公爵的儿子，他的那个多洛霍夫，据说，天知道他们干了些什么勾当。二人都受罪了。多洛霍夫被贬为士兵，别祖霍夫的儿子被赶到莫斯科去了。阿纳托利·库拉金呢，他父亲不知怎的把他制服了，但也被驱逐出彼得堡。”\\n\\n “他们究竟干了些什么勾当？”伯爵夫人问道。\\n\\n “他们真是些十足的土匪，尤其是多洛霍夫，”女客人说道，“他是那个备受尊重的太太玛丽亚·伊万诺夫娜·多洛霍娃的儿子，后来怎么样呢？你们都可以设想一下，他们三个人在某个地方弄到了一头狗熊，装进了马车，开始把它运送到女伶人那里去了。警察跑来制止他们。他们抓住了警察分局局长，把他和狗熊背靠背地绑在一起，丢进莫伊卡河里。狗熊在泅水，警察分局局长仰卧在狗熊背上。”\\n\\n “machère，警察分局局长的外貌好看吗？”伯爵笑得要命，高声喊道。\\n\\n “啊，多么骇人呀！伯爵，这有什么可笑的呢？”\\n\\n 可是太太们情不自禁地笑起来。\\n\\n “真费劲才把这个倒霉鬼救了出来，”女客人继续说下去，“基里尔·弗拉基米罗维奇·别祖霍夫伯爵的儿子心眼真多，逗弄人啊！”她补充一句话，“听人家说，他受过良好的教育，脑子也挺灵活。你看，外国的教育结果把他弄到这个地步。虽然他有钱，我还是希望这里没有谁会接待他。有人想介绍他跟我认识一下，我断然拒绝了：我有几个女儿嘛。”\\n\\n “您干嘛说这个年轻人很有钱呢？”伯爵夫人避开少女们弯下腰来问道，少女们马上装作不听她说话的样子，“要知道，他只有几个私生子女。看来……皮埃尔也是个私生子。”\\n\\n 女客人挥动一手下臂。\\n\\n “我想，他有二十个私生子女。”\\n\\n 公爵夫人安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜插话了，她显然是想显示她的社交关系，表示她熟悉交际界的全部情况。\\n\\n “就是这么一回事，”她低声地、意味深长地说道，“基里尔·弗拉基米罗维奇伯爵颇有名声，尽人皆知……他的儿女多得不可胜数，而这个皮埃尔就是他的宠儿。”\\n\\n “旧年这个老头儿还挺漂亮哩！”伯爵夫人说道，“我还未曾见过比他更漂亮的男人。”\\n\\n “现在他变得很厉害了，”安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜说道。“我想这样说，”她继续说下去，“根据妻子方面的关系，瓦西里公爵是他的全部财产的直接继承人，但是他父亲喜爱皮埃尔，让他受教育，还禀告国王……如果他一旦辞世，他的病情加重，每时每刻都有可能断气，罗兰也从彼得堡来了，谁将会得到这一大笔财产，是皮埃尔呢，或者是瓦西里公爵。四万农奴和数百万财产。这一点我了若指掌，瓦西里公爵亲口对我说过这番话。基里尔·弗拉基米罗维奇正是我的表舅哩。而且他给鲍里斯施行洗礼，是他的教父。”她补充一句，好像一点不重视这等事情似的。\\n\\n “瓦西里公爵于昨日抵达莫斯科。有人对我说，他来的用意是实地视察。”女客人说。\\n\\n “是的，但是，entrenous，”①公爵夫人说道，“这是一种藉口，说实话，他是来看基里尔·弗拉基米罗维奇伯爵的，他听到伯爵的病情加重了。” \\n\\n ①法语：这是我们之间的事，不可与外人道也。\\n\\n 他于是想到那个警察分局局长挥动手臂的模样，又哈哈大笑起来，那响亮的嗓子低沉的笑声撼动着他整个肥胖的身躯，他发出这种笑声，就像平素吃得好，特别是喝得好的人所发出的笑声一样。“好吧，请您到我们那里来用午饭。”他说道。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3294.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
