{"id":41075,"no":100,"title":"Book 5 Chapter 19","content":"AFTER GOING BACK to the regiment and reporting to the colonel the position of Denisov\u0027s affairs, Rostov rode to Tilsit with the letter to the Emperor.\n On the 13th of June the French and Russian Emperors met at Tilsit. Boris Drubetskoy had asked the personage of high rank on whom he was in attendance to include him in the suite destined to be staying at Tilsit.\n “I should like to see the great man,” he said, meaning Napoleon, whom he had hitherto, like every one else, always spoken of as Bonaparte.\n “You are speaking of Buonaparte?” the general said to him, smiling.\n Boris looked inquiringly at his general, and immediately saw that this was a playful test.\n “I am speaking, prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,” he replied. With a smile the general clapped him on the shoulder\n “You will get on,” said he, and he took him with him. Boris was among the few present at Niemen on the day of the meeting of the Emperors. He saw the raft with the royal monograms, saw Napoleon\u0027s progress through the French guards along the further bank, saw the pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat silent in the inn on the bank of the Niemen waiting for Napoleon\u0027s arrival. He saw both the Emperors get into boats, and Napoleon reaching the raft first, walked rapidly forward, and meeting Alexander, gave him his hand; then both the Emperors disappeared into a pavilion. Ever since he had entered these higher spheres, Boris had made it his habit to keep an attentive watch on what was passing round him, and to note it all down. During the meeting of the Emperors at Tilsit, he asked the names of the persons accompanying Napoleon, inquired about the uniforms they were wearing, and listened carefully to the utterances of persons of consequence. When the Emperors went into the pavilion, he looked at his watch, and did not forget to look at it again when Alexander came out. The interview had lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes; he noted this down that evening among other facts, which he felt were of historical importance. As the Emperors\u0027 suite were few in number, to be present at Tilsit at the meeting of the Emperors was a matter of great consequence for a man who valued success in the service, and Boris, when he succeeded in obtaining this privilege, felt that his position was henceforth perfectly secure. He was not simply known, he had become an observed and familiar figure. On two occasions he had been sent with commissions to the Emperor himself, so that the Emperor knew him personally, and all the court no longer held aloof from him, as they had done at first, considering him a new man, and would even have noticed his absence with surprise if he had been away.\n Boris was lodging with another adjutant, the Polish count, Zhilinsky. Zhilinsky, a Pole educated in Paris, was a wealthy man, devotedly attached to the French, and almost every day of their stay in Tilsit, French officers of the Guards and of the French head staff were dining and breakfasting with Zhilinsky and Boris.\n On the 24th of June Zhilinsky, with whom Boris shared quarters, was giving a supper to his French acquaintances. At this supper there were present one of Napoleon\u0027s adjutants—the guest of honour—several officers of the French Guards, and a young lad of an aristocratic old French family, a page of Napoleon\u0027s. On the same evening Rostov, taking advantage of the darkness to pass through unrecognised, came to Tilsit in civilian dress, and went to the quarters of Zhilinsky and Boris.\n Rostov, like the whole army indeed, was far from having passed through that revolution of feeling in regard to Napoleon and the French—transforming them from foes into friends—that had taken place at headquarters and in Boris. In the army every one was still feeling the same mingled hatred, fear, and contempt for Bonaparte and the French. Only recently Rostov had argued with an officer of Platov\u0027s Cossacks the question whether if Napoleon was taken prisoner he was to be treated as an emperor or as a criminal. Only a little while previously Rostov had met a wounded French colonel on the road, and had maintained to him with heat that there could be no peace concluded between a legitimate emperor and the criminal Bonaparte. Consequently it struck Rostov as strange to see French officers in Boris\u0027s quarters wearing the uniforms at which he was used to looking with very different eyes from the line of pickets. As soon as he caught sight of a French officer, that feeling of war, of hostility, which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy, came upon him at once. He stood still on the threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetskoy lived there. Boris, hearing a strange voice in the passage, went out to meet him. For the first moment when he recognised Rostov, his face betrayed his annoyance.\n “Ah, that\u0027s you, very glad, very glad to see you,” he said, however, smiling and moving towards him. But Rostov had detected his first impulse.\n “I have come at a bad time, it seems,” said he; “I shouldn\u0027t have come, but it\u0027s on a matter of importance,” he said coldly.…\n “No, I was only surprised at your getting away from the regiment. I will be with you in a moment,” he said in reply to a voice calling him.\n “I see I have come at a bad time,” repeated Rostov.\n The expression of annoyance had by now vanished from Boris\u0027s face; evidently having reflected and made up his mind how to act, he took him by both hands with marked composure and led him into the next room. Boris\u0027s eyes, gazing serenely and unflinchingly at Rostov, seemed as it were veiled by something, as though a sort of screen—the blue spectacles of conventional life—had been put over them. So it seemed to Rostov.\n “Oh, please, don\u0027t talk nonsense, as if you could come at a wrong time,” said Boris. Boris led him into a room where supper was laid, introduced him to his guests, mentioning his name, and explaining that he was not a civilian, but an officer in the hussars, and his old friend. “Count Zhilinsky, Count N. N., Captain S. S.,” he said, naming his guests. Rostov looked frowning at the Frenchmen, bowed reluctantly, and was mute.\n Zhilinsky was obviously not pleased to receive this unknown Russian outsider into his circle, and said nothing to Rostov. Boris appeared not to notice the constraint produced by the newcomer, and with the same amiable composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had welcomed Rostov, he endeavoured to enliven the conversation. With characteristic French courtesy one of the French officers turned to Rostov, as he sat in stubborn silence, and said to him that he had probably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor.\n “No, I came on business,” was Rostov\u0027s short reply. Rostov had been out of humour from the moment when he detected the dissatisfaction on the face of Boris, and as is always the case with persons who are ill-humoured, it seemed to him that every one looked at him with hostile eyes, and that he was in every one\u0027s way. And in fact he was in every one\u0027s way, and he was the only person left out of the general conversation, as it sprang up again. And what is he sitting on here for? was the question asked by the eyes of the guests turned upon him. He got up and went up to Boris.\n “I\u0027m in your way, though,” he said to him in an undertone; “let us have a talk about my business, and I\u0027ll go away.”\n “Oh, no, not the least,” said Boris. “But if you are tired, come to my room and lie down and rest.”\n “Well, really…”\n They went into the little room where Boris slept. Rostov, without sitting down, began speaking at once with irritation—as though Boris were in some way to blame in the matter. He told him of Denisov\u0027s scrape, asking whether he would and could through his general intercede with the Emperor in Denisov\u0027s favour, and through him present the letter. When they were alone together, Rostov was for the first time distinctly aware that he felt an awkwardness in looking Boris in the face. Boris crossing one leg over the other, and stroking the slender fingers of his right hand with his left, listened to Rostov, as a general listens to a report presented by a subordinate, at one time looking away, at the next looking Rostov straight in the face with the same veiled look in his eyes. Every time he did so, Rostov felt ill at ease, and dropped his eyes.\n “I have heard of affairs of the sort, and I know that the Emperor is very severe in such cases. I think it had better not be taken before his majesty. To my mind, it would be better to apply directly to the commander of the corps.… But generally speaking, I believe…”\n “Then you don\u0027t care to do anything, so say so!” Rostov almost shouted, not looking Boris in the face.\n Boris smiled.\n “On the contrary, I will do what I can, only I imagine…”\n At that moment they heard the voice of Zhilinsky at the door, calling Boris.\n 六月十三日，法国皇帝和俄国皇帝在蒂尔西特聚会。鲍里斯·德鲁别茨科伊向他所依附的要人请求将他编入驻扎于蒂尔西特的随员之列。\n “Je　voudrail　voir　le　grand　homme。”①他说到拿破仑，直到目前，他像大伙儿一样，总把拿破仑称为波拿巴。\n “Vous　parlez　de　Buonaparte？”②那位将军面露微笑地对他说。\n 鲍里斯疑惑地望望自己的将军，他立刻明白，这是一种幽默的刺探。\n “Mon　prince，je　parle　de　l\u0027empeneur　\n Napoléon．”③他回答。将军微笑地拍拍他的肩膀。 \n ①法语：我希望会见一位伟人。\n ②法语：您说的是波拿巴吗？\n ③法语：公爵，我是说拿破仑皇帝。\n 在觐见二位皇帝的那天，为数不多的人员到了涅曼，其中包括鲍里斯。他看见带花字头的一排排木筏，看见拿破仑在河对岸从法国近卫军近旁驶过，当亚历山大皇帝在涅曼河岸上的一家酒肆中等候拿破仑驾临的时候，他看见亚历山大皇帝陷入沉思的面容；他看见两位皇帝上了小船，拿破仑首先靠拢木筏，他迈着飞快的脚步前去迎接亚历山大，向他伸出手来，他们二人在幔帐中消失不见了。鲍里斯自从进入上层社会的活动范围以来，他就使他自己养成仔细观察周围的动静并且一一记录的习惯。他在蒂尔西特觐见二位皇帝的时候，详细地打听那些随同拿破仑抵达的人员的名字，打听他们所穿的制服，留心地听取要人的讲话。当二位皇帝走进幔帐的时候，他看看怀表，当亚历山大走出幔帐的时候，他没有忘记再看一次怀表。会见延续一小时零五十三分，当天晚上他把这件事记载在他认为具有历史意义的其他事实中。因为皇帝的侍从寥寥无几，所以对一个珍视事业成就的人来说，二位皇帝见面时能在蒂尔西特逗留是一件十分重要的事，鲍里斯来到蒂尔西特后感觉到，从这个时候起他的地位完全确立了。人人不仅认识他，而且看惯了他。他曾有两回奉命觐见国王，因此国王认识他的面貌，国王的亲信们不仅不像从前那样认为他是个新来的人而怕和他见面，而且，假如他不在场，他们反而会感到惊奇的。\n 鲍里斯和另一名副官、波兰伯爵日林斯基住在一起。日林斯基是在巴黎受过教育的波兰人，很有钱，热爱法国人，法国近卫军和司令部的军官在蒂尔西特逗留期间，几乎每天都在日林斯基和鲍里斯那里集合，共进早餐和午餐。\n 六月二十四日晚上，日林斯基伯爵，和鲍里斯住在一起的人，为他自己的法国熟人举办了一次晚宴。一名贵宾——拿破仑的副官、几名法国近卫军军官、法国老贵族出身的少年，拿破仑的少年侍从出席了这次晚宴。就在这一天，罗斯托夫趁黑夜不被人认出的机会，穿着一身便服，驶至蒂尔西特，走进了日林斯基和鲍里斯的住所。\n 罗斯托夫如同整个军队（他是从军队中来的），在对待由敌人转变成朋友的拿破仑和法国人的态度上，还远未发生大本营和鲍里斯身上所发生的这种巨大变化。军队中仍能体验到仇视、轻蔑和畏惧波拿巴与法国人的掺杂在一起的情绪。还在不久前，罗斯托夫和普拉托夫师的一名哥萨克军官谈话时，这样争论：如果拿破仑被俘，他们不会把他看作国王，而会把他看作罪人。不久以前罗斯托夫在途中遇见一名负伤的法国上校，罗斯托夫急躁起来，他向这名上校证明，在合法的国王和罪犯波拿巴之间不可能有媾和之事。罗斯托夫习惯用迥异的眼光从侧翼防御散兵线上观看法国军官的军装，因此鲍里斯住宅中的法国军官们的外貌竟使罗斯托夫感到惊讶。他一看见从门内探出身子的法国军官，那种看见敌人时经常体验到的战斗的敌对情绪忽然把他控制住了。他在门坎上停步，用俄国话问他，德鲁别茨科伊是不是住在这里。鲍里斯在接待室听见陌生人的嗓音，就走出去迎接他。当他乍见罗斯托夫时，他脸上流露出懊恼的神情。\n “啊，是你，看见你我很高兴，我很高兴。”他说，不过面露微笑，移动脚步，向他走去。但是罗斯托夫发现了他最初的内心活动。\n “我好像来得不是时候，”他说道，“我原想不来，可是我有桩事情。”他冷淡地说……\n “不，我感到惊讶的只是，你怎么从兵团走到这里来了，Dans　un　moment　je　suis　à　vous①。”他听见喊他的声音就转过头来回答。\n “我知道，我来得不是时候。”罗斯托夫重复地说。\n 鲍里斯脸上懊恼的表情已经消失了，显然，经过考虑后决定他该怎么办，他特别沉着地握住他的两只手，把他领到隔壁房里。鲍里斯的眼睛平静而坚定地望着罗斯托夫，它仿佛被什么东西蒙着，仿佛被日常生活所必需的蓝色眼镜遮住了。罗斯托夫好像有这种感觉。\n “噢，真的，得啦，你哪里会来得不是时候。”鲍里斯说道。鲍里斯把他领进房里来，这里摆好了桌子开晚饭，他喊了一声罗斯托夫的姓名并说明他不是文官，而是骠骑兵军官，是他的老友。“这位是日林斯基伯爵。le　comte　N．N．，le　Capitaine　S．S．②。”他说出客人们的姓名。罗斯托夫皱起眉头望着几个法国人，不乐意地鞠躬行礼，一直沉默着。 \n ①法语：我愿意马上为您效劳。\n ②法语：这位是N．N．伯爵，这位是S．S．上尉。\n “不，我有我自己的事。”罗斯托夫简短地回答。\n 罗斯托夫在发现鲍里斯面露不满的神色后，他立刻显得心情不舒畅，他好像觉得，大家恶意地望着他，他正在妨碍大家，这是心绪不佳的人们常有的情形。他确乎妨碍大家。虽然大家又交谈起来，惟独他一人置身于局外。“他干嘛坐在这儿呢？”客人们向他投射的目光仿佛这样说。他站了起来，走到鲍里斯面前。\n “不过，我使你觉得不自在，”他对他轻声地说，“我们同去谈谈一件事儿，谈完之后我就要走了。”\n “不，根本不是这么回事，”鲍里斯说道，“如果疲倦了，就到我房里去吧，躺下来休息休息。”\n “果然是……”\n 他们走进鲍里斯睡觉的一个小房间。罗斯托夫还没有坐下来，就感到非常忿恨，好像鲍里斯对不起他似的，他立刻向他谈起杰尼索夫的事，他问到，他是否愿意，是否能够通过自己的将军替杰尼索夫向国王求情，并且通过将军转交一封信。当他们二人留下的时候，罗斯托夫第一次证实，他不好意思去望鲍里斯的眼睛。鲍里斯跷起二郎腿，一面用左手抚摸右手的纤细的指头，一面细听罗斯托夫讲话，如同将军细听手下人汇报一般，他时而向一旁观看，时而他的目光中也像蒙着一层什么东西，而眼直勾勾地盯着罗斯托夫的眼睛，每当鲍里斯这样注视罗斯托夫的时候，他总觉得不好意思，于是就垂下眼帘。\n “我听过这种案件，并且知道，国王严厉地对待这种案件。我想莫如不让他陛下知道。依我看，最好干脆向军长求情……\n 但一般说来，我想……”\n “那么你什么也不愿意办．你就照直说！”罗斯托夫不望鲍里斯的眼睛，差不多叫喊起来。\n 鲍里斯微微一笑。\n “我倒是要尽力去办，不过我想到……”\n 这时门内传来了日林斯基呼喊鲍里斯的声音。\n “喂，走吧，走吧，走吧……”罗斯托夫说，他拒绝了晚饭，独自一人留在小房间里，他在房间里踱来踱去，踱了很久，倾听隔壁房里法国人的快活的谈话声。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3398.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
