{"id":41122,"no":147,"title":"Book 8 Chapter 6","content":"COUNT ILYA ANDREITCH ROSTOV arrived in Moscow towards the end of January with Natasha and Sonya. The countess was still unwell, and unable to travel, but they could not put off coming till she recovered, for Prince Andrey was expected in Moscow every day. They had, besides, to order the trousseau, to sell the estate in the suburbs of Moscow, and to take advantage of old Prince Bolkonsky\u0027s presence in Moscow to present his future daughter-in-law to him. The Rostovs\u0027 house in Moscow had not been heated all the winter; and as they were coming only for a short time, and the countess was not with them, Count Ilya Andreitch made up his mind to stay with Marya Dmitryevna Ahrostimov, who had long been pressing her hospitality upon the count.\n Late in the evening the four loaded sledges of the Rostovs drove into the courtyard of Marya Dmitryevna in Old Equerrys\u0027 Place. Marya Dmitryevna lived alone. She had by now married off her daughter. Her sons were all in the service.\n She still held herself as erect; still gave every one her opinions in the same loud, outspoken, decided fashion; and her whole bearing seemed a reproof to other people for every sort of weakness, passion, and temptation, of which she would not admit the bare possibility. In the early morning, in a house-jacket, she looked after the management of her household. Then she drove on saints\u0027 days to Mass, and from Mass to the gaols and prisons; and of what she did there, she never spoke to any one.\n On ordinary days she dressed and received petitioners of various classes, of whom some sought her aid every day. Then she had dinner, an abundant and appetising meal, at which some three or four guests were always present. After dinner she played a game of boston; and at night had the newspapers and new books read aloud to her while she knitted. It was only as a rare exception that she went out in the evening; if she did so, it was only to visit the most important people in the town.\n She had not gone to bed when the Rostovs arrived, and the door in the vestibule squeaked on the block, as the Rostovs and their servants came in from the cold outside. Marya Dmitryevna stood in the doorway of the hall, with her spectacles slipping down on her nose, and her head flung back, looking with a stern and irate face at the new-comers. It might have been supposed that she was irritated at their arrival, and would pack them off again at once, had she not at the very time been giving careful instructions to her servants where to install her guests and their belongings.\n “The count\u0027s things? Bring them here,” she said, pointing to the trunks, and not bestowing a greeting on any one. “The young ladies\u0027, this way to the left. Well, what are we pottering about for?” she called to her maids. “Warm the samovar! She\u0027s plumper, prettier,” she pronounced of Natasha, flushed from the frosty air, as she drew her closer by her hood. “Foo! she is cold! You make haste and get your wraps off,” she shouted to the count, who would have kissed her hand. “You\u0027re frozen, I warrant. Rum for the tea! Sonyushka, bonjour,” she said to Sonya, indicating by this French phrase the slightly contemptuous affectionateness of her attitude to Sonya.\n When they had all taken off their outdoor things, set themselves straight after the journey, and come in to tea, Marya Dmitryevna kissed them all in due course.\n “Heartily glad you have come, and are staying with me,” she said. “It\u0027s long been time you were here,” she said, with a significant glance at Natasha.… “The old fellow\u0027s here, and his son\u0027s expected from day to day. You must, you must make their acquaintance. Oh, well, we shall talk of that later on,” she added, with a glance at Sonya, showing that she did not care to talk of it before her. “Now, listen,” she turned to the count, “what do you want to do to-morrow? Whom will you send for? Shinshin?”—she crooked one finger. “The tearful Anna Mihalovna— two. She\u0027s here with her son. The son\u0027s to be married too! Then Bezuhov. He\u0027s here, too, with his wife. He ran away from her, and she has come trotting after him. He dined with me last Wednesday. Well, and I\u0027ll take them”—she indicated the young ladies—“to-morrow to Iversky chapel, and then we shall go to Aubert-Chalmey. You\u0027ll be getting everything now, I expect! Don\u0027t judge by me—the sleeves nowadays are like this! The other day the young princess, Irina Vassilyevna, came to see me, just as though she had put two barrels on her arms, a dreadful fright. Every day there\u0027s a new fashion. And what sort of business is it you have come for yourself?” she said severely, addressing the count.\n “Everything has come together,” answered the count. “There\u0027s the girl\u0027s rags to buy; and now there\u0027s a purchaser turned up for the Moscow estate and the house. If you\u0027ll graciously permit it, I\u0027ll choose an opportunity and drive over to Maryinskoe for a day, leaving my girls on your hands.”\n “Very good, very good, they\u0027ll be safe enough with me. I\u0027m as safe as the Mortgage Bank. I\u0027ll take them where they must go, and scold them and pet them too,” said Marya Dmitryevna, putting her big hand on the cheek of her favourite and god-daughter Natasha.\n Next morning Marya Dmitryevna bore the young ladies off to Iversky chapel and to Madame Aubert-Chalmey, who was so frightened of Marya Dmitryevna that she always sold her dresses at a loss simply to get rid of her as soon as possible. Marya Dmitryevna ordered almost the whole trousseau. On their return, she sent every one out of the room but Natasha, and called her favourite to sit beside her arm-chair.\n “Well, now we can have a chat. I congratulate you on your betrothed. A fine fellow you have hooked! I\u0027m glad of it for your sake, and I have known him since he was that high”—she held her hand a yard from the floor. Natasha flushed joyfully. “I like him and all his family. Now, listen! You know, of course, that old Prince Nikolay was very much against his son\u0027s marrying. He\u0027s a whimsical old fellow! Of course, Prince Andrey is not a child, he can get on without him, but to enter a family against the father\u0027s will is not a nice thing to do. One wants peace and love in a family. You\u0027re a clever girl, you\u0027ll know how to manage things. You must use your wits and your kind heart. And every thing will come right.”\n Natasha was silent, not as Marya Dmitryevna supposed from shyness. In reality Natasha disliked any one\u0027s interfering in what touched her love for Prince Andrey, which seemed to her something so apart from all human affairs, that no one, as she imagined, could understand it. She loved Prince Andrey, and only him, and knew only him; he loved her, and was to arrive in a day or two and carry her off. She did not care about anything else.\n “I have known him a long while, do you see; and Masha, your sister-in-law, I love. Sisters-in-law are said to be mischief-makers, but she— well, she wouldn\u0027t hurt a fly. She has begged me to bring you two together. You must go to see her to-morrow with your father, and be as nice as possible; you are younger than she is. By the time your young man comes back, you\u0027ll be friends with his sister and his father, and they will have learned to love you. Yes or no? It will be better so, eh?”\n “Oh yes!” Natasha responded reluctantly.\n 深夜，罗斯托夫之家的四辆雪橇开进了旧马厩街玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜的庭院。玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜独自一人住在这里。她把女儿嫁出去了。她的几个儿子都在机关里服务。\n 她待人总是那么坦率，在对任何人提出意见时，总是那么爽快，说话的声音洪亮，意志坚定，她仿佛以身作则，诚恳地责备别人的各种弱点、情欲和嗜癖，她不认为自己身上有这些毛病。大清早，她就穿上短棉袄，搞一点家务，之后，每逢节日去做日祷，日祷完毕后便去寨堡和监狱，她在那里从事什么活动，她不向任何人透露，在平日里，她穿好衣裳后，便来招待每天到她家里来的各个不同阶层的向他求援的人，然后用午餐，在味美而丰盛的午餐上，经常有三四位来客，在午餐之后打一圈波士顿牌，晚上叫人给她读报，给她读新书，她一边听，一边做针织活计。她很少破例驱车出门，如果出门，只不过是访问城里的高官显贵而已。\n 当罗斯托夫一家人抵达的时候，她还没有上床睡觉，接待室的门上的滑轮嘎吱嘎吱地响起来，他们让罗斯托夫一家人和女仆从寒冷的户外走进来。玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜把眼镜拉到鼻梁上，头向后仰，站在大厅门口，显露出气势汹汹的严肃而暴躁的神态望着走进来的人。可以设想，她对进来的人不满，假如这时候她不忙碌地吩咐仆人们把来客分别安置好，同时把他们的行李一一放好的话，人们真会以为她立刻要把客人赶出去。\n “是伯爵的行李吗？拿到这里来，”她说道，指着那几只手提箱，但是没有同任何人打招呼，“小姐们，向左转，到这里来。喂，你们干嘛要巴结！”她对几个丫头喊了一声，“热一热茶炊！——你长得更胖了，变得更好看了！”她拽着把脸冻得通红的娜塔莎的风帽，把她拖到身边来。说道，“嘿，觉得冷吧！快点儿宽衣吧，”她对正想走到她跟前来吻吻她的手的伯爵喊了一声，“你冻僵了，是不是？喝茶的时候，你把糖酒端来吧！——索纽什卡，bonjour①。”她对索尼娅说，她用法国话问好，突出她对索尼娅的略嫌藐视的、温和的态度。 \n ①法语：你好。\n “你们光临敝舍，并在我处下榻，我由衷地高兴，”她说道，“早就应该来呀，”她说道，意味深长地看看娜塔莎……“老头子在这里，他儿子一两天内就能回来。应该、应该和他认识一下。哦，这件事我们以后再谈吧。”她补充一句，看了看索尼娅，那目光表明，她不想在她面前谈论这桩事。“现在请听着，”她向伯爵转过脸去说，“——明天你有何贵干？派人去把谁请来呢？把申申请来？她屈起一个指头，把那个哭鬼安娜·米哈伊洛夫娜也请来，两个人啦。她和儿子都在这里。儿子快娶亲啦！然后再请别祖霍夫，是不是？他和妻子也在这里。他躲开她，可是她乘马车来找他了。礼拜三他在我这儿吃了一顿午饭。啊，她们呢，”她指指小姐们说，“明儿我带领她们到伊韦尔小教堂去，然后我们顺路到奥贝尔·夏尔姆时装店去一趟。你们大概都要做新衣裳吧？不要拿我的衣袖来说吧，瞧，就是这个样儿！前几天，年轻的公爵小姐伊琳娜·瓦西里耶夫娜到我这儿来了，看看她，真吓人啊，她手上套着两个大圆桶。如今一日一个新式样。你本人要办什么事儿？”她把脸转向伯爵，严肃地说。\n “各种情形都凑在一起了，”伯爵答道，“要给姑娘们购买各式各样的衣服，这儿还有个买主，他要买莫斯科近郊的田庄和住宅。如果您能够开恩，我就要选择个时间到马林斯科耶去一天，把我两个小姑娘交给您照管。”\n “好，好，她们在我这儿万无一失。在我这儿就像在监护委员会里一样。她们该去什么地方玩，我就带领她们去，我可以骂骂她们，抚爱抚爱她们。”玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜说，她一面用她那只粗大的手触动一下她特别宠爱的姑娘和教女娜塔莎的面颊。\n 第二天早上，玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜把两个小姐带到伊韦尔小教堂去，后来又把她们带到奥贝尔·夏尔姆太太那里去，她很惧怕玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜，所以她常常亏本向她售出自己的衣服，只是想叫她快点儿离开。玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜差不多定购了全部嫁妆。她回家后，便把所有的人从房里赶出去，只留下娜塔莎一个人，叫她特别宠爱的姑娘坐在她的安乐椅上。\n “啊，我们现在谈谈吧。我祝贺你有个未婚夫。你已经找到一个棒小伙子！我替你高兴，他从小时候我就认识（她比划给她看，离地一俄尺那样高）。”娜塔莎高兴得满面通红。\n “我喜欢他，也喜欢他全家人。现在你听着。你要晓得，年老的公爵尼古拉很不想要他儿子娶亲。一个神经质的老人啊！自然，安德烈公爵不是毛孩子，他不过问也能顺利地办成这件事，不过违背家父的旨意进入家门总不太妙。一家人要和睦共处，亲如手足。你是一个聪明人，会应付自如。你要精明能干点，妥善地应付过去。这样，一切都会好起来。”\n 玛丽亚·德米特里耶夫娜想到，娜塔莎由于腼腆而默默不语，但在事实上娜塔莎感到非常不愉快：大家干预她爱安德烈公爵这种事，在她看来，这件事与众人的任何事情迥然不同，按照她的观点，谁也不能理解它。她只知道并且爱慕安德烈公爵，他也爱她，最近几天内要来接她。她再也不需要别的什么了。\n “你要明白，我老早就认识他，我也喜欢你的小姑子玛申卡。小姑子是好争吵的妇女，可是这个小姑子连苍蝇也不会欺侮。她求我让她和你会会面。你明天和你父亲一起到她那里去，你要对她表示亲热，藉以博得欢心，你比她年纪更轻。你的那个人抵达后，你和他妹妹、他父亲都认识了，他们都很喜欢你。对不对呢？这样岂不更妙？”\n “那更好。”娜塔莎不乐意地回答。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3445.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
