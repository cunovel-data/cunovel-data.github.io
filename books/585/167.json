{"id":41142,"no":167,"title":"Book 9 Chapter 4","content":"AT TWO O\u0027CLOCK in the night of the 13th of June, the Tsar sent for Balashov, and, reading him his letter to Napoleon, commanded him to go in person and give the letter to the French Emperor. As he dismissed Balashov, he repeated to him his declaration that he would never make peace as long as a single enemy under arms remained on Russian soil, and told him to be sure to repeat those words to Napoleon. The Tsar had not inserted them in his letter to Napoleon, because, with his characteristic tact, he felt those words would be inappropriate at the moment when the last efforts were being made for conciliation; but he expressly charged Balashov to repeat that message by word of mouth to Napoleon.\n Balashov rode out on the night between the 13th and the 14th, accompanied by a trumpeter and two Cossacks; and at dawn he reached the French outposts at the village of Rykonty on the Russian side of the Niemen. He was stopped by the sentinels of the French cavalry.\n A French subaltern of hussars, in a crimson uniform and a fur cap, shouted to Balashov to stop. Balashov did not immediately obey, but went on advancing along the road at a walking pace.\n The subaltern, with scowls and muttered abuse, swooped down upon Balashov, drew his sword, and shouted rudely to the Russian general: “Was he deaf that he did not hear when he was spoken to?” Balashov gave him his name. The subaltern sent a soldier to his superior officer.\n Paying no further attention to Balashov, the subaltern began talking with his comrades about regimental matters, without looking at the Russian general. It was an exceedingly strange sensation for Balashov, who was used at all times to the dignities of his position, was always in contact with the highest power and authority, and only three hours before had been conversing with the Tsar, to be brought here on Russian soil into collision with this hostile, and still more, disrespectful display of brute force.\n The sun was only beginning to rise behind storm-clouds, the air was fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the village. Larks sprang up trilling one after another in the fields, like bubbles rising to the surface of water.\n Balashov looked about him, awaiting the arrival of the officer from the village. The Russian Cossacks and trumpeter and the French hussars looked at one another now and then in silence.\n A French colonel of hussars, evidently only just out of bed, came riding out of the village on a handsome, sleek, grey horse, accompanied by two hussars. The officers, the soldiers, and the horses all looked smart and well satisfied.\n In this early stage of the campaign the troops were well in a state of good discipline, in good, almost parade, order, and engaged in peaceful pursuits, with a shade of martial swagger in their dress, and a shade of gaiety and spirit of adventure in their temper that always accompanies the commencement of a war.\n The French colonel had much ado to suppress his yawns, but was courteous in his manner, and evidently understood all the importance of Balashov\u0027s position. He led him past the line of outposts, and informed him that his desire to be presented to the Emperor would in all probability immediately be satisfied, as the Emperor\u0027s quarters were, he believed, not far off.\n They rode through the village of Rykonty, past French picket ropes, sentinels, and soldiers, who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at the Russian uniform. They came out on the other side of the village, and the colonel told Balashov that they were only two kilometres from the commander of the division, who would receive him and conduct him to his destination.\n The sun had by now fully risen and was shining cheerfully on the bright green fields.\n They had just passed an inn and were riding uphill when a party of horsemen came riding downhill towards them. The foremost figure was a tall man, in a hat with plumes, mounted on a raven horse, with trappings glittering in the sun. He had a scarlet cloak, and curly black hair, that floated on his shoulders, and he rode in the French fashion, with his long legs thrust out in front. This personage galloped towards Balashov, with his jewels and gold lace and feathers all fluttering and glittering in the bright June sun.\n Balashov was some ten yards from this majestically theatrical figure in bracelets, feathers, necklaces, and gold, when Julner, the French colonel, whispered to him reverentially, “The King of Naples!” It was in fact Murat, who was now styled the “King of Naples.” Though it was utterly incomprehensible that he should be the King of Naples, he was addressed by that title, and was himself persuaded of his royal position, and consequently behaved with an air of greater solemnity and dignity than heretofore. So firmly did he believe that he really was the King of Naples, that when, just before leaving Naples, he was greeted by some Italians with shouts of “Long live the King!” when walking in the streets with his wife, he turned to her with a pensive smile and said, “Poor fellows, they don\u0027t know I am quitting them to-morrow.”\n But though he believed so implicitly that he was King of Naples, and sympathised with his subjects\u0027 grief at losing him, after he had been commanded to return to the service, and especially after his interview with Napoleon at Danzig, when his most august brother-in-law had said, “I have made you king that you may rule in my way, and not in your own,” he had cheerfully resumed his familiar duties; and, like a well-fed, but not over-fed stallion feeling himself in harness, prancing in the shafts, and decked out in all possible motley magnificence, he went galloping along the roads of Poland, with no notion where or why he was going.\n On seeing the Russian general he made a royal, majestic motion of his head with his floating curls, and looked inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel deferentially informed his majesty of the mission of Balashov, whose name he could not pronounce. “De Bal-macheve!” said the King, resolutely attacking and vanquishing the colonel\u0027s difficulty. “Charmed to make your acquaintance, general,” he added, with a gesture of royal condescension. As soon as the King spoke loudly and rapidly, all his royal dignity instantly deserted him, and, without himself being aware of it, he passed into the tone of good-humoured familiarity natural to him. He laid his hand on the forelock of Balashov\u0027s horse. “Well, general, everything looks like war,” he said, as it were regretting a circumstance on which he could not offer an opinion. “Your majesty,” answered Balashov, “the Emperor, my master, does not desire war, and as your majesty sees.” Balashov declined “your majesty” in all its cases, using the title with an affectation inevitable in addressing a personage for whom such a title was a novelty.\n Murat\u0027s face beamed with foolish satisfaction as he listened to “Monsieur de Balacheff.” But royalty has its obligations. He felt it incumbent on him to converse with Alexander\u0027s envoy on affairs of state as a king and an ally. He dismounted, and taking Balashov\u0027s arm, and moving a little away from the suite, who remained respectfully waiting, he began walking up and down with him, trying to speak with grave significance. He mentioned that the Emperor Napoleon had been offended at the demand that his troops should evacuate Prussia, especially because that demand had been made public, and was so derogatory to the dignity of France. Balashov said that there was nothing derogatory in that demand, seeing that…Murat interrupted him.\n “So you consider that the Emperor Alexander is not responsible for the commencement of hostilities?” he said suddenly, with a foolish and good-humoured smile.\n Balashov began to explain why he did consider that Napoleon was responsible for the war.\n “Ah, my dear general,” Murat interrupted him again, “with all my heart I wish that the Emperors would settle the matter between themselves; and that the war, which has been begun by no desire of mine, may be concluded as quickly as possible,” he said in the tone in which servants speak who are anxious to remain on friendly terms though their masters have quarrelled. And he changed the subject; inquiring after the health of the Grand Duke, and recalling the agreeable time he had spent with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as though recollecting his royal dignity, Murat drew himself up majestically, threw himself into the pose in which he had stood at his coronation, and waving his right arm, said: “I will detain you no longer, general; I wish you success in your mission.” And, with a flutter of his scarlet cloak and his feathers, and a flash of his precious stones, he rejoined the suite, who were respectfully awaiting him.\n Balashov rode on further, expecting from Murat\u0027s words that he would be very shortly brought before Napoleon himself. But at the next village he was detained by the sentinels of Davoust\u0027s infantry corps, just as he had been at the outposts. An adjutant of the commander of that corps was sent for to conduct him to the village to see Marshal Davoust.\n 十三日夜里，巴拉瑟夫带一名号手和两名哥萨克出发了，拂晓前到达涅曼河右岸法军前哨阵地雷孔特村，他被法军骑哨拦住了。\n 一位身穿深红色制服，头戴毛茸茸的帽子的骠骑兵士官（军士）喝令走近的巴拉瑟夫站住。巴拉瑟夫并没有马上停下来，而是继续沿着道路缓步行进。\n 军士皱着眉头，嘟嘟囔囔地骂了一句，提马将巴拉瑟夫挡住，他手握军刀，粗暴地喝斥俄罗斯将军，问他：是不是聋子，听不见对他说的话。巴拉瑟夫通报了自己的身份。军士派了一名士兵去找军官。\n 士官再也不理巴拉瑟夫，开始与同事们谈论自己团队的事，看也不看俄罗斯将军。\n 巴拉瑟夫一向接近最高权势，三小时前还与皇帝谈过话，由于自己所处地位，已经习惯于受人尊敬。而现在在俄罗斯领土上，遇到这种敌对的态度，主要的是对他如此粗暴无礼，这使他不胜惊奇。\n 太阳刚一从乌云后升起，空气清新，满含湿露。人们已把畜群从村里赶到大路上。云雀唱着嘹亮的歌，像泉水的泡珠似的一个接一个，扑棱棱地从田野里腾空而起。\n 巴拉瑟夫一边等候着从村里来的军官，一边环顾自己周围。俄罗斯哥萨克和号手与法国骠骑兵也不时默默地互相打量着对方。\n 一位法国骠骑兵上校，看样子刚起床，骑着一匹漂亮的肥壮的大灰马，带着两位骠骑兵从村里出来了。无论是那军官，还是士兵，或是他们的坐骑，都是得意洋洋和炫耀阔绰的样子。\n 军队还有和平时期的整齐的军容，几乎像和平时期准备检阅似的，只是服装上带有耀武扬威和开战之初常有的那种兴奋和精明强干的神情。这便是战争初期。\n 法国上校竭力忍住打哈欠，但却很有礼貌，看来，他明白巴拉瑟夫的全部意思在那里。他领着巴拉瑟夫绕过自己的士兵到散兵线后方，并告知他说，他要得见皇帝的愿望大概马上就会实现，因为，据他所知，皇帝的住处就在不远处。\n 他们从法国骠骑兵的拴马地经过，从向自己的上校敬礼并且好奇地打量俄国军装的哨兵和士兵们旁边穿过雷孔特村庄，走到村子的另一边。据上校说，师长就在两公里远的地方，他会接待巴拉瑟夫，并送他到他要去的地方。\n 太阳已经升高了，欢乐地照耀着鲜绿的草木。\n 他们走到一家小酒馆后面刚要上山时，正好山脚下迎面出现一群骑马的人，为首的是一匹乌黑的马，马具在阳光下闪闪发亮，马上骑者身材高大，帽上插着羽毛，黑发垂肩，身穿红色斗篷状的礼服，像法国人骑马一样向前伸出两条长腿。这人策马疾驰，迎向巴拉瑟夫，帽上的羽毛、宝石、金色的衣饰在六月的阳光下闪亮和飘动。\n 当法国上校尤里涅尔恭恭敬敬地低声说：“Le　roi　de　Naples。”①时，巴拉瑟夫离那位向他奔来的骑马者只有约两马的距离了。那人有一副庄重的舞台面孔，带着手镯，项链，满身珠光宝气。果然，这就是那个称作那不勒斯王的缪拉。虽然为什么他是那不勒斯王完全是一件莫名其妙的事，但人们那样称呼他，而他本人也确信这一点，因此显出一副比以前更庄严和了不起的派头。他相信他真的是那不勒斯王，当他从那不勒斯出发的前一天，他与妻子在街上散步，几个意大利人向他叫喊：“Viva　il　re！”②他含着伤感的微笑转脸对妻子说：“Les　malheureux，il　ne　savent　pas　que　je　les　quitte　demain！”③ \n ①法语：那不勒斯王。\n ②法语：国王万岁！\n ③法语：可怜的人们，他们不知道明天我就要离开他们了。\n 一看见俄罗斯将军，他摆出国王的派头，威严地昂起垂肩黑发的头，疑问地看了看那位法国上校。上校毕恭毕敬地向他的陛下转达了巴拉瑟夫的使命，他对巴拉瑟夫的姓氏说不出来。\n “巴里玛瑟夫！”国王说，用自己的坚决果断克服了上校的困难，“Charmé　de　faire　votre　connaissance，général，”②他又以王者宽厚仁慈的姿态补充道。国王刚一开始很快地大声讲话，他那王者的尊严霎时间消失得无影无踪，他不自觉地换用他固有的亲热的随和的腔调。他把自己的手放在巴拉瑟夫坐骑的鬣毛上。\n “En　bien，général，tout　est　à　la　guerre，à　ce　pu\u0027il　parait．”③他说，仿佛对他不能判断的局势表示遗憾似的。 \n ①法语：我立你为王是为了让你按我的方式而不是按你自己的方式来统治。\n ②法语：认识你，非常高兴，将军。\n ③法语：怎么样，将军，一切都好像要打仗的样子。\n 听巴拉瑟夫先生讲话时，缪拉的脸上露出愚蠢的得意洋洋的神情。但royauté　oblige③，他觉得作为国王和同盟者有必要与亚历山大的使者谈谈国家大事。他翻身下马，挽着巴拉瑟夫的手臂，走到离恭候他的随从几步远的地方，一边漫步，一边尽可能有意义地谈话。他提到拿破仑皇帝对从普鲁士撤出军队的要求感到受了侮辱，特别是这种要求被搞得天下皆知，因此冒犯了法国的尊严。巴拉瑟夫说，这个要求毫无冒犯的地方，因为……缪拉打断了他的话：“那么，你认为主谋不是亚历山大皇帝吗？”他带着温和而愚蠢的微笑突然说道。\n 巴拉瑟夫说了为什么他确实认为拿破仑是战争的发动者。“Eh，mon　cher　général（啊，亲爱的将军）。”缪拉又一次打断他的话，“je　désire　de　tout　mon　coeur　que　les　empereurs　s\u0027arrangent　entre　eux，et　que　la　guerre　commencée　malgré　moi　se　termine　le　plus　foAt　possible．”④他说这话用的是各自的主人们在争吵，却愿意友好相处的仆人谈话的腔调。接着他转而问起大公的情况，问起他的健康，并回忆起与他一起在拿不勒斯度过的愉快而开心的时光。随后，仿佛是猛然悟到自己的国王的尊严，缪拉庄重地挺直身子，摆出举行加冕礼时的姿态，挥动右手说道：“Je　ne　vous　retiens　plus，géneral；je　souhaite　le　succés　de　votre　mission．”⑤于是，他招展着他的绣花红斗篷和漂亮的羽毛，闪耀着全身的珠光宝气，到恭候他的随从那儿去了。 \n ①法语：陛下，俄罗斯皇帝并不希望打仗，陛下是知道的。\n ②法语：陛下。\n ③法语：为王者，有其应尽的义务。\n ④法语：啊，亲爱的将军，我衷心希望两国皇帝能够达成协议，尽早结束违反我意志的战争。\n ⑤法语：我不再耽误您了，将军；祝您顺利完成您的使命。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3465.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
