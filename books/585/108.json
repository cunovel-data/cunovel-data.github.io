{"id":41083,"no":108,"title":"Book 6 Chapter 6","content":"DURING THE FIRST PART of his stay in Petersburg, Prince Andrey found all the habits of thought he had formed in his solitary life completely obscured by the trifling cares which engrossed him in Petersburg.\n In the evening on returning home he noted down in his memorandum-book four or five unavoidable visits or appointments for fixed hours. The mechanism of life, the arrangement of his day, so as to be in time everywhere, absorbed the greater part of his vital energy. He did nothing, thought of nothing even, and had no time to think, but only talked, and talked successfully, of what he had had time to think about in the past in the country.\n He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that it happened to him to repeat the same remarks on the same day to different audiences. But he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to reflect that he was thinking of nothing. Just as at their first meeting at Kotchubey\u0027s, Speransky had a long and confidential talk with Prince Andrey on Wednesday at his own home, where he received Bolkonsky alone and made a great impression on him.\n Prince Andrey regarded the immense mass of men as contemptible and worthless creatures, and he had such a longing to find in some other man the living pattern of that perfection after which he strove himself, that he was ready to believe that in Speransky he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous man. Had Speransky belonged to the same world as Prince Andrey, had he been of the same breeding and moral traditions, Bolkonsky would soon have detected the weak, human, unheroic sides of his character; but this logical turn of mind was strange to him and inspired him with the more respect from his not fully understanding it. Besides this, Speransky, either because he appreciated Prince Andrey\u0027s abilities or because he thought it as well to secure his adherence, showed off his calm, impartial sagacity before Prince Andrey, and flattered him with that delicate flattery that goes hand in hand with conceit, and consists in a tacit assumption that one\u0027s companion and oneself are the only people capable of understanding all the folly of the rest of the world and the sagacity and profundity of their own ideas.\n In the course of their long conversation on Wednesday evening Speransky said more than once: “Among us everything that is out of the common rut of tradition is looked at,” … or with a smile: “But we want the wolves to be well fed and the sheep to be unhurt.” … or: “They can\u0027t grasp that” … and always with an expression that said. “We, you and I, we understand what they are and who we are.”\n This first long conversation with Speransky only strengthened the feeling with which Prince Andrey had seen him for the first time. He saw in him a man of vast intellect and sober, accurate judgment, who had attained power by energy and persistence, and was using it for the good of Russia only. In Prince Andrey\u0027s eyes Speransky was precisely the man—finding a rational explanation for all the phenomena of life, recognising as of importance only what was rational and capable of applying the standard of reason to everything—that he would have liked to be himself. Everything took a form so simple, so clear in Speransky\u0027s exposition of it that Prince Andrey could not help agreeing with him on every subject. If he argued and raised objections it was simply with the express object of being independent and not being entirely swayed by Speransky\u0027s ideas. Everything was right, everything was as it should be, yet one thing disconcerted Prince Andrey. That was the cold, mirror-like eye of Speransky, which seemed to refuse all admittance to his soul, and his flabby, white hand, at which Prince Andrey instinctively looked, as one usually does look at the hands of men who have power. That mirror-like eye and that flabby hand vaguely irritated Prince Andrey. He was disagreeably struck too by the excessive contempt for other people that he observed in Speransky, and by the variety of the lines of argument he employed in support of his views. He made use of every possible weapon of thought, except analogy, and his transitions from one line of defence to another seemed to Prince Andrey too violent. At one time he took his stand as a practical man and found fault with idealists, then he took a satirical line and jeered sarcastically at his opponents, then maintained a strictly logical position, or flew off into the domain of metaphysics. (This last resource was one he was particularly fond of using in argument.) He raised the question into the loftiest region of metaphysics, passed to definitions of space, of time, and of thought, and carrying off arguments to confute his opponent, descended again to the plane of the original discussion. What impressed Prince Andrey as the leading characteristic of Speransky\u0027s mind was his unhesitating, unmovable faith in the power and authority of the reason. It was plain that Speransky\u0027s brain could never admit the idea—so common with Prince Andrey—that one can never after all express all one thinks. It had never occurred to him to doubt whether all he thought and all he believed might not be meaningless nonsense. And that peculiarity of Speransky\u0027s mind was what attracted Prince Andrey most.\n During the first period of his acquaintance with Speransky, Prince Andrey had a passionate and enthusiastic admiration for him, akin to what he had once felt for Bonaparte. The very fact that Speransky was the son of a priest, which enabled many foolish persons to regard him with vulgar contempt, as a member of a despised class, made Prince Andrey peculiarly delicate in dealing with his own feeling for Speransky and unconsciously strengthened it in him.\n On that first evening that Bolkonsky spent with him, they talked of the commission for the revision of the legal code; and Speransky described ironically to Prince Andrey how the commission had been sitting for one hundred and fifty years, had cost millions, and had done nothing, and how Rosenkampf had pasted labels on all the various legislative codes.\n “And that\u0027s all the state has got for the millions it has spent!” said he. “We want to give new judicial powers to the Senate, and we have no laws. That\u0027s why it is a sin for men like you, prince, not to be in the government.”\n Prince Andrey observed that some education in jurisprudence was necessary for such work, and that he had none.\n “But no one has, so what would you have? It\u0027s a circulus viciosus, which one must force some way out of.”\n Within a week Prince Andrey was a member of the committee for the reconstruction of the army regulations, and—a thing he would never have expected—he was also chairman of a section of the commission for the revision of the legal code. At Speransky\u0027s request he took the first part of the civil code under revision; and with the help of the Napoleonic Code and the Code of Justinian he worked at the revision of the section on Personal Rights.\n 晚上回家时，他在记事手册中记下四五次必须出席的拜会，或者是定出时间的rendez－vous①。机械的生活、一日的时间的安排（务求随时随地准时办理应办的事情），耗费了他的大部分精力。他无所事事，甚至不思忖任何事情，而且也没有工夫去思忖，只是一味地叙述，巧妙地叙述他昔日在农村里深思熟虑的事情。 \n ①法语：约会。\n 嗣后于周三，斯佩兰斯基在自己家中单独地接待博尔孔斯基，这次接见也像在科丘别伊家里初次和他会面那样，斯佩兰斯基坦率地和他谈了很久的话，给安德烈公爵留下了强烈的印象。\n 安德烈公爵认为大多数人都是可鄙而渺小的人物，他很想在他人身上发现他所渴求的真正的美德的典范，他轻易地相信，他在斯佩兰斯基身上发现了十分明智的有美德的人的典范。如果斯佩兰斯基出身于安德烈公爵那个社会阶层，具有同样的教养和道德品质，那么博尔孔斯基很快就会发现他这个非英雄人物的、普通人固有的弱点，但现今这个令他惊异的聪明人的气质，因为未被他充分领会，所以更加引起了他的敬意。此外斯佩兰斯基是不是因为他器重安德烈公爵的才能，或者是因为他认为必须把他弄到自己手上来；所以斯佩兰斯基在安德烈公爵面前显示他那冷静而公正的理性，微妙地谄媚安德烈公爵，这种谄媚夹杂着过分的自信，即是说默认，只有对话人和自己才能理解所有其他人的愚昧，才能领会他那明智而深邃的思想。\n 礼拜三晚上，当他们长谈的时候，斯佩兰斯基不止一次地说：“大家都在观察我们的一切超出常轨的积习……”或者微笑着说：“不过，我们既要狼吃饱，又要羊不少……”或者说：“他们不能明白这一点……”总是流露出这样的表情，它仿佛在说：“我们就是：您和我，我们都了解，他们是什么人，我们是什么人。”\n 他头一次和斯佩兰斯基长谈，只会在安德烈公爵身上加强初次看见他时体会到的感觉。他认为他是一个富有理性的善于缜密思考的聪明绝顶的人，他以其全副精力和坚韧不拔的意志获得了权力，并用以仅为俄国谋求福利。斯佩兰斯基在安德烈公爵心目中是个这样的人：他能明智地说明生活中的各种现象，认为合理的现象才是真实的并善于应用理性的准则来衡量一切事物，他自己想要成为这样的人。斯佩兰斯基似乎将一切阐述得简单明了，以致安德烈公爵情不自禁地在各个方面赞同他的看法。若是他表示异议或者争论，那只是因为他想独树一帜，不想完全屈服于斯佩兰斯基的意见。这一切都是对的，一切都挺好，但是只有一点使安德烈公爵困惑不解，这就是斯佩兰斯基的目光——它显得冷漠、镜子一般清澈，使人无法洞察他的心灵，还有他那只洁白而柔嫩的手臂，安德烈公爵情不自禁地注视着它，就像人们通常观赏有权有势的人们的手臂那样。镜子般清澈的目光、这只又白又嫩的手臂不知怎的激怒了安德烈公爵。而且他发现斯佩兰斯基过分地蔑视他人，运用各种手法来论证自己的意见，这使安德烈公爵十分诧异，使他心里不高兴。除开不采用比喻而外，他采用了各种可以采用的思维手段，安德烈公爵仿佛觉得，他过分大胆地变换了一种又一种手段。他时而站在讲求实际的活动家的立场谴责幻想家，时而站在讽刺家的立场嘲笑自己的敌人，时而变得过分严谨，时而突然上升到形而上学领域（最后这一论证手段他尤为常用）。他把这一问题提到形而上学的高度，给空间、时间、思想下定义，从那里得出驳斥的论据，然后从上而下，又回到争论的范畴。\n 总的说来，使安德烈公爵感到惊讶的斯佩兰斯基的智慧的主要特点，是他对智慧的力量和合理性怀有无可置疑的坚定信念。由此可见，斯佩兰斯基的头脑中从来不会出现安德烈公爵认为平凡的思想，你毕竟不能表达你所想到的一切事情，也从来不会怀疑：我所想到的一切和我所相信的一切是否是无稽之谈？正是斯佩兰斯基这种特殊的思维方式最能引起安德烈公爵的注意。\n 安德烈公爵和斯佩兰斯基结识之初，他曾对他怀有强烈的钦佩感，如同以往他对波拿巴怀有的感情一样。斯佩兰斯基是牧师的儿子，一些愚昧的人可能会蔑视他这个替教堂跑腿的牧师的儿子，许多人都是这样的，正是这种情形迫使安德烈公爵特别珍视他对斯佩兰斯基的感情，而且不知不觉地在他内心深处加深了这种感情。\n 博尔孔斯基在斯佩兰斯基那里度过的头一个夜晚，斯佩兰斯基畅谈法律编辑委员会的情形，他带着讥讽的口气向他讲到，法律编辑委员会成立五十年，耗费资财几百万，毫无作为，只有罗森坎普夫在那比较法条文上贴了一张张标签。\n “这就是国家花费几百万卢布所取得的全部成就啊！”他说道，“我们要赐予参政院以新的司法权，可是我们还没有法典。因此像您这种人，公爵，现在不应该不供职了。”\n 安德烈公爵说，干这项工作要受过法律教育，而他都没有这样的教育水准。\n “谁也没有这样的教育水准，那您想怎么办呢？这是一个要费劲才能冲出去的circulus　uviciosus①。”\n 一星期以后，安德烈公爵竟当了军事条令编辑委员会委员，这是一件他根本意料不到的事，而且兼任法律编辑委员会中一个科的科长。根据斯佩兰斯基的要求，编辑民法第一部分，并且借助于Code　Napoléon和Justinian②，编写“人权”这一章的条文。 \n ①法语：魔力圈。\n ②法语：《拿破仑法典》和《查士丁尼法典》。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3406.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
