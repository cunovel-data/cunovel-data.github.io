{"id":41009,"no":34,"title":"Book 2 Chapter 9","content":"PURSUED by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command of Bonaparte, received with hostility by the inhabitants, losing confidence in their allies, suffering from shortness of supplies, and forced to act under circumstances unlike anything that had been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men, under the command of Kutuzov, beat a hasty retreat to the lower ground about the Danube. There they halted, and were overtaken by the enemy, and fought a few rear-guard skirmishes, avoiding an engagement, except in so far as it was necessary to secure a retreat without the loss of their baggage and guns. There were actions at Lambach, at Amsteten, and at Melk; but in spite of the courage and stubbornness—acknowledged even by the enemy—with which the Russians fought, the only consequence of these engagements was a still more rapid retreat. The Austrian troops that had escaped being taken at Ulm, and had joined Kutuzov\u0027s forces at Braunau, now parted from the Russian army, and Kutuzov was left unsupported with his weak and exhausted forces. The defence of Vienna could no longer be dreamed of. Instead of the elaborately planned campaign of attack, in accordance with the principles of the modern science of strategy, the plan of which had been communicated to Kutuzov during his sojourn in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole aim—almost a hopeless one—that remained now for Kutuzov was to avoid losing his army, like Mack at Ulm, and to effect a junction with the fresh troops marching from Russia.\n On the 28th of October, Kutuzov took his army across to the left bank of the Danube, and then for the first time halted, leaving the Danube between his army and the greater part of the enemy\u0027s forces. On the 30th he attacked Mortier\u0027s division, which was on the left bank of the Danube, and defeated it. In this action for the first time trophies were taken—a flag, cannons, and two of the enemy\u0027s generals. For the first time, after retreating for a fortnight, the Russian troops had halted, and after fighting had not merely kept the field of battle, but had driven the French off it. Although the troops were without clothing and exhausted, and had lost a third of their strength in wounded, killed, and missing; although they had left their sick and wounded behind on the other side of the Danube, with a letter from Kutuzov commending them to the humanity of the enemy; although the great hospitals and houses in Krems could not contain all the sick and wounded,—in spite of all that, the halt before Krems and the victory over Mortier had greatly raised the spirits of the troops. Throughout the whole army, and also at headquarters, there were the most cheerful but groundless rumours of the near approach of the columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of the retreat of Bonaparte panic-stricken.\n Prince Andrey had been during the engagement in attendance on the Austrian general Schmidt, who was killed in the battle. His horse had been wounded under him, and he had himself received a slight wound on his arm from a bullet. As a mark of special favour on the part of the commander-in-chief, he was sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court, now at Brünn, as Vienna was threatened by the French. On the night of the battle, excited, but not weary (though Prince Andrey did not look robustly built, he could bear fatigue better than very strong men), he had ridden with a despatch from Dohturov to Krems to Kutuzov. The same night he had been sent on with a special despatch to Brünn. This commission, apart from its reward, meant an important step in promotion.\n The night was dark and starlit; the road looked black in the white snow that had fallen on the day of the battle. With his mind filled with impressions of the battle, joyful anticipations of the effect that would be produced by the news of the victory, and recollections of the farewells of the commander-in-chief and his comrades, Prince Andrey trotted along in a light posting cart, with the sensations of a man who, after long waiting, has at last attained the first instalment of some coveted happiness. As soon as he closed his eyes, the firing of guns and cannons was echoing in his ears, and that sound blended with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory. At one moment he would begin to dream that the Russians were flying, that he was himself slain; but he waked up in haste, and with fresh happiness realised anew that that was all unreal, and that it was the French, on the contrary, who were put to flight. He recalled again all the details of the victory, his own calm manliness during the battle, and, reassured, he began to doze.… The dark, starlit night was followed by a bright and sunny morning. The snow was thawing in the sun, the horses galloped quickly, and new and different-looking forests, fields, and trees flew by on both sides of the road alike.\n At one of the stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded. The Russian officer in charge of the transport lay lolling back in the foremost cart, and was shouting coarse abuse at a soldier. In each of the long German Vorspanns six or more pale, bandaged, and dirty wounded men were being jolted over the stony roads. Some of them were talking (he caught the sound of Russian words), others were eating bread; the most severely wounded gazed dumbly at the posting cart trotting by, with the languid interest of sick children.\n Prince Andrey told the driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what battle they had been wounded.\n “The day before yesterday on the Danube,” answered the soldier. Prince Andrey took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces.\n “For all,” he added, addressing the officer as he came up. “Get well, lads,” he said to the soldiers, “there\u0027s a lot to do yet.”\n “What news?” asked the officer, evidently anxious to get into conversation.\n “Good news! Forward!” he called to the driver, and galloped on.\n It was quite dark when Prince Andrey rode into Br?nn, and saw himself surrounded by high houses, lighted shops, the lighted windows of houses, and street lamps, handsome carriages noisily rolling over the pavement, and all that atmosphere of a great town full of life, which is so attractive to a soldier after camp. In spite of the rapid drive and sleepless night, Prince Andrey felt even more alert, as he drove up to the palace, than he had on the previous evening. Only his eyes glittered with a feverish brilliance, and his ideas followed one another with extreme rapidity and clearness. He vividly pictured again all the details of the battle, not in confusion, but definitely, in condensed shape, as he meant to present them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would make to them. He imagined that he would be at once presented to the Emperor. But at the chief entrance of the palace an official ran out to meet him, and learning that he was a special messenger, led him to another entrance.\n “Turning to the right out of the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren, you will find the adjutant on duty,” the official said to him. “He will conduct you to the minister of war.”\n The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrey, asked him to wait, and went into the war minister. Five minutes later the adjutant returned, and with marked courtesy, bowing and ushering Prince Andrey before him, he led him across the corridor to the private room of the war minister. The adjutant, by his elaborately formal courtesy, seemed to wish to guard himself from any attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian adjutant. The joyous feeling of Prince Andrey was considerably damped as he approached the door of the minister\u0027s room. He felt slighted, and the feeling of being slighted passed instantaneously without his being aware of it himself—into a feeling of disdain, which was quite uncalled for. His subtle brain at the same instant supplied him with the point of view from which he had the right to feel disdain both of the adjutant and the minister of war. “No doubt it seems to them a very simple matter to win victories, never having smelt powder!” he thought. His eyelids drooped disdainfully; he walked with peculiar deliberateness into the war minister\u0027s room. This feeling was intensified when he saw the minister of war sitting at a big table, and for the first two minutes taking no notice of his entrance. The minister of war had his bald head, with grey curls on the temple, held low between two wax candles; he was reading some papers, and marking them with a pencil. He went on reading to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps.\n “Take this and give it him,” said the minister of war to his adjutant, handing him the papers, and taking no notice of the Russian attaché.\n Prince Andrey felt that either the minister of war took less interest in the doings of Kutuzov\u0027s army than in any other subject demanding his attention, or that he wanted to make the Russian attaché feel this. “But that\u0027s a matter of complete indifference to me,” thought he. The minister of war put the other remaining papers together, making their edges level, and lifted his head. He had an intellectual and characteristic head. But the instant he turned to Prince Andrey, the shrewd and determined expression of the war minister\u0027s face changed in a manner evidently conscious and habitual. On his face was left the stupid smile—hypocritical, and not disguising its hypocrisy—of a man who receives many petitioners, one after another.\n “From General—Field Marshal Kutuzov?” he queried. “Good news, I hope? Has there been an engagement with Mortier? A victory? It was high time!”\n He took the despatch, which was addressed to him, and began to read it with a mournful expression.\n “Ah! My God! my God! Schmidt!” he said in German. “What a calamity! what a calamity!” Skimming through the despatch, he laid it on the table and glanced at Prince Andrey, visibly meditating on something.\n “Ah, what a calamity! So the action, you say, was a decisive one?” (“Mortier was not taken, however,” he reflected.) “Very glad you have brought good news, though the death of Schmidt is a costly price for the victory. His majesty will certainly wish to see you, but not to-day. I thank you; you must need repose. To-morrow, be at the levée after the review. But I will let you know.”\n The stupid smile, which had disappeared while he was talking, reappeared on the war minister\u0027s face.\n “Au revoir, I thank you indeed. His majesty the Emperor will most likely wish to see you,” he repeated, and he bowed his head.\n As Prince Andrey left the palace, he felt that all the interest and happiness that had been given him by this victory had been left behind by him now in the indifferent hands of the minister and the formal adjutant. The whole tenor of his thoughts had instantaneously changed. The battle figured in his mind as a remote, far-away memory.\n 十月二十八日，库图佐夫带领军队横渡多瑙河抵达左岸，头一次驻扎下来，与法国人的主力分据于多瑙河两岸。三十日，库图佐夫攻打驻守在多瑙河左岸的莫蒂埃师团，把它击溃了。在这次战役中，头一回赢得了战利品：军旗、大炮和两名敌军将领。在两个星期的撤退之后，俄国军队头一次留驻下来，在一场争斗以后，不仅守住了战地，而且驱逐了法国人。虽然这些军队缺少衣服，疲惫不堪，掉队、伤亡和患病的人员占三分之一，削弱了兵力；虽然一些伤病员持有库图佐夫的手谕留在多瑙河对岸（手谕中暗示：听任敌人赐予他们仁慈的照拂）；虽然克雷姆斯的大病院和住房都已变成军医院，但是仍然容纳不了全部伤病员，尽管如此，在克雷姆斯驻留和对莫蒂埃的胜利在颇大程度上提高了部队的士气。在全军之中和在大本营中都散布着令人喜悦、虽然并非真实的传闻，说什么俄国纵队即将来临、奥国人赢得大捷，吓破胆的波拿巴撤退了。\n 作战期间，安德烈公爵曾在这次战役中捐躯的奥地利将军施米特身边服役。他骑的马负了伤，他本人也被子弹擦伤一只手，伤势轻微。多亏总司令给予特殊照顾，他携带大捷的消息被派至奥国宫廷；法国军队的威胁引起宫廷恐惧，奥国宫廷已经不在维也纳，而在布吕恩。作战的深夜，安德烈公爵激动不安，并不感到困倦，虽然看起来他的身体虚弱，但是他比那些最强壮的人更能经受住劳累，他骑上马，随身带着多赫图罗夫的情报前往克雷姆斯晋谒库图佐夫。当天夜晚安德烈公爵充当信使被派往布吕恩。执行信使这一职务，除获得奖励而外，还意味他向升迁的路上迈出一大步。\n 黑夜里星光点点，白皑皑的积雪中的道路显得更黑了，前一天，即是作战的那天下了一场雪。安德烈公爵时而逐一回溯刚刚结束的战斗留下的印象，时而快活地想象他要传达的胜利消息必将造成的印象，一边回味总司令和战友们饯行的情景，安德烈公爵坐在邮车里飞速地行驶，他心中怀有那种感情，就像某人长久地等待、终于开始获得朝思暮想的幸福。他只要闭上眼睛，耳鼓中就会响起枪声和炮声，这声音正和车轮的响声以及大捷的印象融汇在一起了。他时而仿佛觉得，俄国人正在奔跑，而他自己战死了；但是他很快觉醒过来怀着幸福的心情，仿佛又悟到没有发生什么事，又仿佛觉得法国官兵反而逃跑了。他又回想起大捷的详情细节和他在作战时的镇静和英勇精神，于是他心安理得，打起盹来……在昏暗的星夜之后阳光灿烂的欢乐的早晨来到了。积雪在阳光下融化，马儿飞速奔驰着，道路的左右两侧，闪过了不熟悉的五颜六色的森林、田野和村庄。\n 他在一个车站上赶过了装运俄国伤员的车队。一名押运的俄国军官把手脚伸开懒洋洋地躺在前面的大车上，一面叫喊着什么，一面说着士兵的粗话骂人。几辆德国制造的长车身马车，沿着石板马路颠簸着，每辆都载有六名以上的脸色苍白、缠上绷带、形容污秽的伤员。其中一些人正在谈话（他听见俄国口音），另外一些人在吃面包，伤势至为严重的都默不作声，都带着温顺、痛苦而幼稚的心情望着从他们身旁疾驰而去的信使。\n 安德烈公爵吩咐手下人停步，向一名士兵询问，他们是在什么战役中负伤的。\n “前天在多瑙河上负伤的。”士兵回答。安德烈公爵掏出钱包把三枚金币交给士兵。\n “是给你们大家的，”他向那个朝他跟前走来的军官补充说。“伙伴们，养好伤吧，”他把脸转向士兵们说道，“还有许多仗要打啊。”\n “副官先生，怎么样？有什么消息？”军官问道，看起来，他想畅谈一番。\n “有好消息啊！前进。”他向驿站马车夫喊了一声，便乘车往前奔驰而去。\n 当安德烈公爵乘车驶入布吕恩的时候，天色已经黑了，他看见周围有一栋栋高大的楼房，商店和住宅的窗户里灯火通明，一排排路灯闪烁着耀眼的光辉，豪华的马车沿着石板马路驶行，发出辚辚的响声，这正是热热闹闹的大城市的气氛，对那个度过一段兵营生涯的军人来说，这种气氛真是十分诱人的。虽然安德烈公爵快马加鞭，彻夜不眠，但是在他驶近皇宫时，他觉得自己比前夜精神更加抖擞。只是他那对眼睛闪烁着狂热之光。他的心绪万千，接踵而至，思路极其敏捷而且清晰。他的思想上又很生动地浮现出作战的详细情节，这种想象已经不是模糊的，而是合乎逻辑的。他想简单而扼要地向弗朗茨皇帝禀告实情。他的思想上很生动地浮现出一些偶然提出的问题以及他对这些问题作出的回答。他原以为马上有人带他去觐见皇帝。但在皇宫正门前，有一名官员向他跑来，一眼认出他是信差，就把他领到另一道门前。\n “EuerHochgeboren①，沿着走廊向右转，您可以找到值班的侍从武官，”这名官员对他说，“他会带您去见军政大臣。” \n ①德语：大人。\n “您拿着文件，把它转送出去吧。”军政大臣对他的副官说话，并把文件递给他时，还没有理睬这个信使。\n 安德烈公爵已经感觉到，或者在军政大臣所操心的事务中，他对库图佐夫采取的行动丝毫不感兴趣，或者有必要让俄国信差意识到这么一点。“不过我觉得，这横竖一样。”他想了想。军政大臣把其余的文件推到一边，摆得整整齐齐，随后才抬起头来。他那脑袋瓜子挺聪明，个性很倔强。可是在他把脸转向安德烈公爵的这一瞬间，军政大臣脸上流露的聪明而坚定的表情似乎习惯地有意识地突然改变了。地脸上现出愚笨、虚伪、并不掩饰虚伪的微笑，就像某人接见一大批一大批请愿者时面露微笑似的。\n “您是从库图佐夫元帅那里来的？”他问道，“我希望您带来好消息，是吗？和莫蒂埃发生过军事冲突么？打赢了？正是时候啊！”\n 他拿起一份署有他的名字的急电，带着忧悒的表情开始念电文。\n “哎！我的天！我的天！施米特呀！”他用德国话说道，“多么不幸啊！多么不幸啊！”\n 他走马观花地看了一下电文，把它放在桌上，望了望安德烈公爵，看来他在考虑什么事情。\n “哎，多么不幸啊！您说，这是一场决定性的战役吗？但是莫蒂埃还没有被抓起来（他想了想。）。虽然施米特阵亡是为赢得胜利而付出的高昂代价，但是我非常高兴，您带来了好消息。陛下也许很想和您见面，但是并不是今天。我感谢您，去休息休息。明天阅兵后您来朝拜吧。最好还是我来通知您。”\n 谈话时已经消失的愚蠢的微笑又在军政大臣脸上流露出来。\n “再见，我很感谢您。国王也许很想和您见面。”他重说一遍，低下头去。\n 当安德烈公爵从皇宫里走出来的时候，他觉得，胜利给他带来的一切利益和幸福现今已被他抛弃，并且交给军政大臣和谦恭的副官的冷冰冰的手中了。他的全部思想转瞬之间改变了。他仿佛觉得这场战斗已是久远的往事的回忆。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3332.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
