{"id":41221,"no":246,"title":"Book 11 Chapter 21","content":"THE RUSSIAN TROOPS were crossing Moscow from two o\u0027clock at night to two o\u0027clock in the day, and took with them the last departing inhabitants and wounded soldiers.\n The greatest crush took place on the Kamenny bridge, the Moskvoryetsky bridge, and Yauzsky bridge. While the troops, parting in two about the Kremlin, were crowding on to the Moskvoryetsky and Kamenny bridges, an immense number of soldiers availed themselves of the stoppage and the block to turn back, and slipping stealthily and quietly by Vassily the Blessed, and under the Borovitsky gates, they made their way uphill to the Red Square, where some instinct told them they could easily carry off other people\u0027s property. Every passage and alley of the Gostinny bazaar was filled with a crowd, such as throngs there at sales. But there were no ingratiating, alluring voices of shopmen, no hawkers, no motley, female mob of purchasers—everywherewere the uniforms and overcoats of soldiers without guns, going out in silence with loads of booty, and coming in empty-handed. The shopkeepers and shopmen (they were few) were walking about among the soldiers, like men distraught, opening and shutting their shops, and helping their assistants to carry away their wares. There were drummers in the square before the bazaar beating the muster-call. But the roll of the drum made the pillaging soldiers not run up at the call as of old, but, on the contrary, run away from the drum. Among the soldiers in the shops and passages could be seen men in the grey coats, and with the shaven heads of convicts. Two officers, one with a scarf over his uniform, on a thin, dark grey horse, the other on foot, wearing a military overcoat, stood at the corner of Ilyinka, talking. A third officer galloped up to them.\n “The general has sent orders that they positively must all be driven out. Why, this is outrageous! Half the men have run off.”\n “Why, are you off too? … Where are you fellows off to?” … he shouted to three infantry soldiers, who ran by him into the bazaar without guns, holding up the skirts of their overcoats. “Stop, rascals!”\n “Yes, you see, how are you going to get hold of them?” answered another officer. “There\u0027s no getting them together; we must push on so that the last may not be gone, that\u0027s the only thing to do!”\n “How\u0027s one to push on? There they have been standing, with a block on the bridge, and they are not moving. Shouldn\u0027t a guard be set to prevent the rest running off?”\n “Why, come along! Drive them out,” shouted the senior officer.\n The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with him into the arcade. Several soldiers in a group together made a rush away. A shopkeeper, with red bruises on his cheeks about his nose, with an expression on his sleek face of quiet persistence in the pursuit of gain, came hurriedly and briskly up to the officer gesticulating.\n “Your honour,” said he, “graciously protect us. We are not close-fisted—any trifle now … we shall be delighted! Pray, your honour, walk in, I\u0027ll bring out cloth in a moment—a couple of pieces even for a gentleman —we shall be delighted! For we feel how it is, but this is simple robbery! Pray, your honour! a guard or something should be set, to let us at least shut up …”\n Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.\n “Eh! it\u0027s no use clacking,” said one of them, a thin man, with a stern face; “when one\u0027s head\u0027s off, one doesn\u0027t weep over one\u0027s hair. Let all take what they please!” And with a vigorous sweep of his arm he turned away from the officer.\n “It\u0027s all very well for you to talk, Ivan Sidoritch,” the first shopkeeper began angrily. “If you please, your honour.”\n “What\u0027s the use of talking!” shouted the thin man; “in my three shops here I have one hundred thousand worth of goods. How\u0027s one to guard them when the army is gone? Ah, fellows, God\u0027s will is not in men\u0027s hands!”\n “If you please, your honour,” said the first shopkeeper, bowing.\n The officer stood in uncertainty, and his face betrayed indecision. “Why, what business is it of mine!” he cried suddenly, and he strode on rapidly along the arcade. In one open shop he heard blows and high words, and just as the officer was going into it, a man in a grey coat, with a shaven head, was thrust violently out of the door.\n This man doubled himself up and bounded past the shopkeepers and the officer. The officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shop. But meanwhile fearful screams, coming from an immense crowd, were heard near the Moskvoryetsky bridge, and the officer ran out into the square.\n “What is it? What is it?” he asked, but his comrade had already galloped off in the direction of the screams. The officer mounted his horse and followed him. As he drew near the bridge, he saw two cannons that had been taken off their carriages, the infantry marching over the bridge, a few broken-down carts, and some soldiers with frightened, and some with laughing faces. Near the cannons stood a waggon with a pair of horses harnessed to it. Behind the wheels huddled four greyhounds in collars. A mountain of goods was piled up in the waggon, and on the very top, beside a child\u0027s chair turned legs uppermost, sat a woman, who was uttering shrill and despairing shrieks. The officer was told by his comrades that the screams of the crowd and the woman\u0027s shrieks were due to the fact that General Yermolov had come riding down on the crowd, and learning that the soldiers were straying away in the shops, and crowds of the townspeople were blocking the bridge, had commanded them to take the cannons out of their carriages, and to make as though they would fire them at the bridge. The crowd had made a rush; upsetting waggons, trampling one another, and screaming desperately, the bridge had been cleared, and the troops had moved on.\n 行军时，在石桥、在莫斯科河桥和雅乌兹河桥上，发生了异常拥挤的现象。\n 在军队分两路绕过克里姆林宫，聚集到莫斯科河桥和石桥上时，大量士兵趁那短暂停留、互相拥挤的机会，从桥头折回，偷偷摸摸地窜过瓦西里·布拉任内教堂，经博罗维茨基城门回到红场附近的小山上。他们凭着某种感觉，觉得在那里可以轻而易举地拿走别人的东西。这一群家伙，像买便宜货一样，挤满了商场内的大小各条通道。但已听不到店员甜言蜜语劝购的声音，看不到小贩和五颜六色的女顾客——只有士兵的制服和大衣在晃动，士兵们没带武器，空手进去，默默地走出来时全身已鼓鼓囊囊。商人和掌柜（人不太多）像丢了魂似的在士兵中穿行，打开店铺，进去再拴上门，然后同伙计一道把货物搬往别处。商场附近的广场上站着军鼓队，在敲集合鼓。但是鼓声并不能使抢劫的士兵像从前那样跑步集合，他们反而跑得离军鼓更远了。在士兵中间，在店铺里外和过道上，看得见一些穿灰长褂、剃光头的人①。两名军官，一个制服上扎了腰带，骑一匹灰黑的瘦马，另一个穿大衣徒步，站在伊利英卡街拐角上交谈。第三名军官骑马向他们走来。 \n ①指从监狱释放出来的囚犯。\n “你去哪儿？……你们去哪儿？……”他朝三名步兵大声问，这三人没带武器，提着大衣下摆，正经过这里往市场溜。\n “站住，混蛋！”\n “能让他们集合吗？”另一个军官答话。“你集合不起来的；\n 得快点走，免得剩下的人再跑，只能这样！”\n “怎样走呢？——都停在那里，挤在桥上一动不动的。要末布置一条封锁线阻止剩下的人逃跑，好吗？”\n “行啦，快往那边去！把他们赶出来。”上级军官吼叫着。\n 扎腰带的军官翻身下马，叫来一个鼓手，同他一起走进商场拱门。几个士兵撒腿一齐跑掉了。一个鼻子周围发生了一圈红包丘疹的商人，富态的脸上现着镇定的精明的神气，急忙而潇洒地晃着胳膊来到军官面前。\n “大人，”他说，“行行善吧，保护我们吧。这儿无论什么东西我们都不当一回事，我们乐意奉送。请吧，我现在就抱呢料出来。对您这样高贵的人物，就是送两匹也成，悉叫尊便！因为我们觉得，怎么说呢，简直是抢劫！劳驾了！能不能派个岗哨让我们关上门……”\n 几个商人这时围拢了过来。\n “唉！还瞎扯哩，”其中一个瘦个子板着脸说。“脑袋都掉了，还哭头发。爱拿就拿呗！”他使劲一挥手，转身朝向军官。\n “你，伊万·西多内奇，倒真会说，”刚才那位商人生气地插话，“您请吧，大人。”\n “还说啥呢！”瘦个儿叫了起来，“我有三间铺子，十万卢布的货物。难道军队开走了你还保得住。唉，人哪，上帝的旨意是不可违抗的。”\n “请进吧，大人，”刚才那个商人鞠着躬说。军官困惑地站着，脸止现出迟疑不决的神态。\n “这与我无关！”他突然大声地说，顺着店铺快步走开。在一间开着的铺子里，传出斗殴和相骂的声音，当军官走到时，门里跳出一个被推搡出来的人（他穿着一件灰长褂，剃光了头）。\n 这个人弯着腰从商人和军官身旁溜走了。军官冲向这间店铺里的士兵。这时，传来莫斯科河桥上人堆里的恐怖的喊叫声，军官立即跑出商场，到了广场上。\n “怎么回事？怎么回事？”他问，但他的同伴已策马朝喊声方向去了，他走过瓦西里·布拉任内教堂。从商场跑出的军官骑上马也跟着去了。当他骑马跑到桥边，看到两尊卸下前车架的大炮，正走上桥去的步兵，几辆翻倒的大车，看到几张惊慌的面孔，以及喜笑颜开的士兵们的面孔，大炮旁停着一辆双套车。这辆车的车轮后面，蜷缩着四只戴项圈的猎犬。车上的东西堆积如山，最上面。靠着一把倒置的童椅，坐着一位农妇，在刺耳地绝望地尖叫，同志们对军官说，人群的吼声和农妇的尖叫，是由于叶尔莫洛夫将军碰上这群人后，得知士兵们跑到商店去了，成群的百姓堵塞了大桥，他便命令把大炮从前车架卸下，做出将要向桥上开炮的样子。人群碰翻车辆，大声叫喊，拥挤着疏通了大桥，军队方才向前开动。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3544.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
