{"id":41088,"no":113,"title":"Book 6 Chapter 11","content":"THE ROSTOVS\u0027 PECUNIARY POSITION had not improved during the two years they had spent in the country. Although Nikolay Rostov had kept firmly to his resolution, and was still living in a modest way in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little, the manner of life at Otradnoe, and still more Mitenka\u0027s management of affairs, were such that debts went on unchecked, growing bigger every year. The sole resource that presented itself to the old count as the obvious thing to do was to enter the government service, and he had come to Petersburg to seek a post and at the same time, as he said, to let his poor wenches enjoy themselves for the last time. Soon after the Rostovs\u0027 arrival in Petersburg, Berg made Vera an offer, and his offer was accepted. Although in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to the best society—themselves unaware of the fact, and never troubling themselves to consider what society they belonged to—yet in Petersburg their position was an uncertain and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were provincials; and were not visited by the very people who in Moscow had dined at the Rostovs\u0027 expense without their inquiring to what society they belonged. The Rostovs kept open house in Petersburg, just as they used to do in Moscow; and at their suppers people of the most diverse sorts could be seen together—country neighbours, old and not well-to-do country gentlemen with their daughters, and the old maid-of-honour, Madame Peronsky, Pierre Bezuhov, and the son of their district postmaster, who was in an office in Petersburg. Of the men who were constantly at the Rostovs\u0027 house in Petersburg, the most intimate friends of the family were very soon Boris, Pierre, who had been met in the street by the old count and dragged home by him, and Berg, who spent whole days with the Rostovs, and paid the elder of the young countesses, Vera, every attention a young man can pay who intends to make a proposal. Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand that had been wounded at Austerlitz, and the sword quite unnecessarily held in his left. He had related this episode to everybody so persistently and with such an air of importance, that every one had come to believe in the utility and merit of the feat, and Berg had received two decorations for Austerlitz. In the war in Finland, too, he had succeeded in distinguishing himself. He had picked up a fragment of a grenade, by which an adjutant had been killed close to the commander-in-chief, and had carried this fragment to his commander. Again, as after Austerlitz, he talked to every one at such length and with such persistency about this incident that people ended by believing that this, too, was something that ought to have been done, and Berg received two decorations for the Finnish war too. In 1809 he was a captain in the guards with decorations on his breast, and was filling some particularly profitable posts in Petersburg. Though there were some sceptics who smiled when Berg\u0027s merits were mentioned before them, it could not be denied that Berg was a gallant officer, punctual in the discharge of his duties, in excellent repute with the authorities, and a conscientious young man with a brilliant career before him and a secure position, indeed, in society. Four years before, on meeting a German comrade in the parterre of a Moscow theatre, Berg had pointed out to him Vera Rostov, and said to him in German, “That girl will be my wife.” From that moment he had made up his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, after duly considering the Rostovs\u0027 position and his own, he decided that the time had come and made his offer. Berg\u0027s proposal was received at first with a hesitation by no means flattering for him. It seemed a strange idea at first that the son of an obscure Livonian gentleman should propose for the hand of a Countess Rostov. But Berg\u0027s leading characteristic was an egoism so na?ve and good-natured that the Rostovs unconsciously began to think that it must be a good thing since he was himself so firmly convinced that it would be a good thing, and indeed a very good thing. The Rostovs were, moreover, seriously embarrassed in their pecuniary affairs, a fact of which the suitor could not but be aware; and what was the chief consideration, Vera was now four-and-twenty, and had been brought out everywhere; and, in spite of the fact that she was undeniably good-looking and sensible, no one had hitherto made her an offer. The offer was accepted. “You see,” Berg said to a comrade, whom he called his friend—only because he knew all people do have friends—“you see, I have taken everything into consideration, and I should not have got married if I had not thought it well over, or if it had been unsuitable in any way. But at present my papa and mamma are well provided for, I have secured them the lease of that place in the Ostsee district, and I can live in Petersburg with my pay and her fortune and my careful habits. We can get along nicely. I\u0027m not marrying for money, I consider that ungentlemanly, but the wife ought to bring her share and the husband his. I have my position in the service; she has connections and some small means. That\u0027s worth something nowadays, isn\u0027t it? And what\u0027s the chief consideration, she\u0027s handsome, estimable girl, and she loves me.…” Berg blushed and smiled. “And I love her because she has a character that is reasonable and very nice. Her sister now—though they are of the same family—is utterly different, and her character is disagreeable, and she has none of that intelligence, but something you know … I don\u0027t like. … But my betrothed … You must come and see us; come to …” Berg, went on; he was going to say “to dinner,” but on second thoughts he said “to tea,” and putting out his tongue he blew a little ring of tobacco smoke that embodied for him all his dreams of happiness. The first feeling of hesitation aroused in the parents by Berg\u0027s proposal had been followed by the festivity and rejoicing in the family usual on such occasions, but the rejoicing was apparent and not genuine. A certain embarrassment and shamefacedness could be detected in the feelings of the relations in regard to this marriage. It was as though their conscience smote them for not having been very fond of Vera and of being so ready now to get her off their hands. The old count was more disconcerted over it than any one. He would most likely have been unable to say what made him feel so, but his financial difficulties were at the root of the matter. He absolutely did not know what he had, how much his debts amounted to, and what he would be in a position to give for Vera\u0027s dowry. Each of his daughters had at their birth been assigned a portion, consisting of an estate with three hundred serfs on it. But one of those estates had by now been sold, and the other had been mortgaged, and the interest was so much in arrears that it would have to be sold, so that to give this estate was impossible. There was no money either. Berg had been betrothed more than a month, and it was only a week before the date fixed for the wedding, but the count was still unable to come to a decision on the subject of the dowry, and had not spoken of it to his wife. At one time the count thought of making over the Ryazan estate to Vera, then he thought of selling his forest, then of borrowing money on a note of hand. A few days before the wedding, Berg went early in the morning into the count\u0027s study, and with an agreeable smile, respectfully invited his father-in-law to let him know what fortune would be given with the Countess Vera. The count was so much disconcerted by this long-foreseen inquiry that, without thinking, he said the first thing that came into his head. “I like your being businesslike about it, I like it; you will be quite satisfied…” And clapping Berg on the shoulder, he got up, intending to cut short the conversation. But Berg, smiling blandly, announced that if he were not to know for certain what would be given with Vera, and to receive at least part of the dowry in advance, he would be obliged to break off the marriage. “Because, you must consider, count, if I were to allow myself to marry now without having a definite security for the maintenance of my wife I should be acting like a scoundrel…” The conversation ended by the count, in his anxiety to be generous and to avoid further requests, saying that he would give him a note of hand for eighty thousand. Berg smiled gently, kissed the count on the shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but could not make his arrangements in his new life without receiving thirty thousand in ready money. “Twenty thousand at least, count,” he added, “and then a note of hand simply for sixty thousand.” “Yes, yes, very good,” said the count hurriedly. “Only excuse me, my dear boy, I\u0027ll give you twenty thousand and the note of hand for eighty thousand as well. That\u0027s all right, kiss me.” 虽然尼古拉·罗斯托夫坚持自己的主见，在偏远的兵团里默默无闻地继续供职，花费的金钱比较少了，但是在奥特拉德诺耶过着那么恶劣的生活，特别是米坚卡那样料理事情，以致于债务与年俱增。老伯爵显然以为，唯一的接济家庭的办法，就是在机关供职，于是他来到彼得堡谋求差事，正如他所说的那样，要谋差事，同时要最后一次让姑娘们感到点快慰。 罗斯托夫家来到彼得堡后不久，贝格向薇拉求婚，他的求婚被接受了。 虽然罗斯托夫家在莫斯科属于上层社会，他们自己并不知道，也未曾想到他们属于什么样的社会，但在彼得堡，他们的社会是很混杂的，不稳定的。在彼得堡他们是外省人，那些不探听他们属于何种社会，不屈尊俯就他们的人，在莫斯科都曾受到罗斯托夫家的款待。 罗斯托夫家在彼得堡就像在莫斯科一样殷勤地接待客人，形形色色的人士都在他们的晚宴上集会：奥特拉德诺耶的邻人、不富裕的老地主及其女儿们、宫廷女官佩龙斯卡娅、皮埃尔·别祖霍夫和在彼得堡服务的县邮政支局局长的儿子。在男客之中，鲍里斯·皮埃尔和贝格很快就成了彼得堡的罗斯托夫家中亲密的客人；如果老伯爵在街上遇见皮埃尔，他就会强拉硬拽地把他请到自己家中去做客；贝格在罗斯托夫家中消度整天整天的时光，他对伯爵的大小姐非常关心，通常只有意欲求婚的年轻人才会对她这样关怀备至。 贝格并非平白地让大家看看他那只在奥斯特利茨战役负伤的右手，他用左手握着一柄毫无用途的军刀。他一个劲儿、意味深长地向大家讲述这一事件，以致大家相信，他的作为是合理的、值得称颂的，而贝格因于奥斯特利茨立功而获得两枚奖章。 他在芬兰战争中也立了功。一枚手榴弹炸死了在总司令身边的副官，贝格拣起榴弹的碎片，把它送到长官面前。就像在奥斯特利茨战役后那样，他又长久地、执着地向大家讲这一事件，以致大家同样地相信，贝格必须这样做，他于是又因于芬兰战争中立功而获得两枚奖章。一八○九年，他佩戴勋章荣任近卫军上尉，并且在彼得堡据有特别有利的地位。 虽然有些自由思想家也微露笑容，当人们对他们提起贝格的优点时，他们不得不承认，贝格已改邪归正，是个勇敢的军官，他博得长官的好感，又是个道德高尚的青年，而且具有锦绣前程，甚至在社会上已取得巩固地位。 四年前贝格在莫斯科戏院的池座中遇见一个德国籍同事，他把薇拉·罗斯托娃指给他看，并且说了一句德国话：“Das　soll　mein　Weib　werden．”①从那时起他决定娶她为妻。眼前在彼得堡，他把罗斯托夫家的和他自己的地位加以比照，于是断定，时机到了，就向她求婚。 ①德语：瞧，她将是我的妻子。 “您要知道，”贝格对他的同事说，他称他做朋友只是因为他晓得所有的人都有朋友。“您要知道，我把这一切都考虑到了，假如我不考虑全部情况，假如由于某种原因不应当这样做，假如我不考虑全部情况，那么我就不会娶她了。而今适得其反，我的爹娘生活上已有保障，我给他们在波罗的海东部边区料理了地租这件事，而我自己有一份薪俸，她有一份财产，兼之我兢兢业业，可以在彼得堡活下去了。还可以活得很好。我不是为钱才娶她为妻，我认为贪钱是不高尚的行为，但是总得要妻子把她的一份财产从娘家带来，而丈夫也要拿出他自己的那一份。我有我的一份差事，她有她的人情关系，还有不多的钱财，在我们这个时代，这事儿总会起着一点什么作用，不是么？而主要是她长得非常漂亮，是个令人敬重的姑娘，而且她爱我……” 贝格涨红了脸，微微一笑。 “我之所以爱她，因为她的性格很好，偏重理性。她还有一个同姓的妹妹，就完全不同，她的性格令人厌恶，没有她那样聪明，就是这么一个人，知道么？……令人厌恶……而我的未婚妻……将来您会常常到我这儿来的……”贝格继续说，他本想说一声“吃午饭”，但是改变了主意，他说：“喝茶吧。”他飞快把舌头向前一伸，吐出一个充分体现幸福梦想的圆圆的小烟圈儿。 贝格的求婚使她的双亲头一次产生困窘的感觉之后，家庭中洋溢着常在这种场合出现的节日气氛和欢乐景象，但是这种快乐不是真实的，而是表面的。亲人们对这门婚事显然流露着一种惊惶不安和羞愧的心情。现在他们觉得好像很不好意思，因为他们很少疼爱薇拉，现在竟然甘愿把她从手上丢掉。老伯爵心里觉得最腼腆。他也许还不善于说明他困窘不安的原因，而这个原因就是他在钱财方面的拮据。他压根儿不知道，他有多少钱财，他有多少债务，他能拿出什么给薇拉作妆奁。假如生了几个女儿，按照规定要将一个具有三百农奴的村庄给每个女儿作陪嫁，可是有一个村庄已经卖掉了，另外一个业已典当，而且过了期限，只得把这个村庄卖出去，因此陪送领地的事儿就办不成了，也没有现钞。 贝格已经当了一个多月的未婚夫，离举行婚礼只有一个星期，伯爵还没有解决备办嫁妆的问题，也没有亲自和妻子提及这件事。伯爵时而想把梁赞的领地拨给薇拉，时而想卖出森林，时而想贷进一笔钱。结婚前几天，贝格一清早就走进伯爵的书斋，面露愉快的微笑，恭恭敬敬地请他未来的岳父告诉他，伯爵小姐薇拉可以得到什么妆奁。伯爵一听到这个老早就预感到的问题，觉得不好意思，他未经深思熟虑便说出他头脑首先想到的话。 “你这样关心，我很喜欢，你感到满意，我很喜欢……” 他于是拍拍贝格的肩膀，站起来，想停止谈话。但是贝格面露愉快的微笑，解释说，如果他没法确切地知道他们会拨给薇拉什么财产作嫁妆，如果他不能事先得到他们预定拨给她的陪嫁中的哪怕一部分，他就不得不拒绝这门婚事。 “原因是这样，伯爵，请您考虑一下，如果我现在没有一定数量的钱财来维持妻子的生活，就让自己来结婚，那我就算干了可鄙的勾当……” 谈来谈去，谈到最后，伯爵想对他宽宏大量，不要他一再提出要求，于是开口说，他给贝格八万卢布的期票。贝格温顺地微微一笑，吻吻伯爵的肩头，并且说，他非常感激，但在没有得到三万卢布现款以前，现在决不能安排新生活。 “伯爵，即使给两万卢布也好，”他补充说，“那末，期票只给六万卢布。” “对，对，很好，”伯爵像放连珠炮似的说，“只不过请你原谅，朋友，我给你两万卢布，此外给你八万卢布的期票。那么你吻吻我吧。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3411.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
