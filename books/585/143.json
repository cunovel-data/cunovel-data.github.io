{"id":41118,"no":143,"title":"Book 8 Chapter 2","content":"AT THE BEGINNING of the winter Prince Nikolay Andreitch Bolkonsky and his daughter moved to Moscow. His past, his intellect and originality, and still more the falling off at about that time of the popular enthusiasm for the rule of the Tsar Alexander and the anti-French and patriotic sentiments then prevailing at Moscow, all contributed to make Prince Nikolay Andreitch at once an object of peculiar veneration and the centre of the Moscow opposition to the government.\\n\\n The prince had greatly aged during that year. He had begun to show unmistakable signs of failing powers, sudden attacks of drowsiness, and forgetfulness of events nearest in time, and exact memory of remote incidents, and a childlike vanity in playing the part of leader of the Moscow opposition. But in spite of that, when the old man came into the drawing-room in the evenings to tea, in his wig and fur coat, and on being incited to do so by some one, began uttering abrupt observations on the past, or still more abrupt and harsh criticisms on the present—he aroused the same feeling of esteem and reverence in all his guests. For visitors, that old-fashioned house, with its huge mirrors, pre-revolutionary furniture, and powdered lackeys, and the stern and shrewd old man, himself a relic of a past age, with the gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman, both so reverently devoted to him, made a stately and agreeable spectacle. But those visitors did not reflect that, apart from the couple of hours during which they saw the household, there were twenty-two hours of the day and night during which the secret, private life of the house went on its accustomed way.\\n\\n That inner life had become very hard for Princess Marya of late in Moscow. She was deprived in Moscow of her two greatest pleasures—talks with God\u0027s folk and the solitude which had refreshed her spirit at Bleak Hills, and she had none of the advantages and pleasures of town life. She did not go into society; every one knew that her father would not allow her to go anywhere without him, and owing to his failing health he could go nowhere himself. She was not even invited now to dinner-parties or balls. Princess Marya had laid aside all hopes of marriage. She saw the coldness and hostility with which the old prince received and dismissed the young men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at the house. Friends, Princess Marya now had none; during this stay in Moscow she had lost all faith in the two friends who had been nearest to her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom she had never been able to be perfectly open, she now regarded with dislike, and for certain reasons kept at a distance. Julie, with whom Princess Marya had kept up an unbroken correspondence for five years, was in Moscow. When Princess Marya renewed her personal relations with her, she felt her former friend to be utterly alien to her. Julie, who had become, by the death of her brothers, one of the wealthiest heiresses in Moscow, was at that time engrossed in a giddy whirl of fashionable amusements. She was surrounded by young men, whom she believed to have become suddenly appreciative of her qualities. Julie was at that stage when a young lady is somewhat past her first youth in society and feels that her last chance of marrying has come, and that now or never her fate must be decided. With a mournful smile Princess Marya reflected every Thursday that she had now no one to write to, seeing that Julie was here and saw her every week, though her friend\u0027s actual presence gave her no sort of pleasure. Like the old French émigré, who declined to marry the lady with whom he had for so many years spent his evenings, she regretted that Julie was here and she had no one to write to. In Moscow Princess Marya had no one to speak to, no one to confide her sorrows to, and many fresh sorrows fell to her lot about this time. The time for Prince Andrey\u0027s return and marriage was approaching, and his commission to her to prepare her father\u0027s mind was so far from being successfully carried out that the whole thing seemed hopeless; and any reference to the young Countess Rostov infuriated the old prince, who was for the most part out of humour at all times now. Another trouble that weighed on Princess Marya of late was due to the lessons she gave to her six-year-old nephew. In her relations with little Nikolay she recognised to her consternation symptoms of her father\u0027s irritable character in herself. However often she told herself that she must not let herself lose her temper, when teaching her nephew, almost every time she sat down with a pointer showing him the French alphabet, she so longed to hasten, to make easy the process of transferring her knowledge to the child, who was by now always afraid his auntie would be angry the next moment, that at the slightest inattention she was quivering in nervous haste and vexation, she raised her voice and sometimes pulled him by his little hand and stood him in the corner. When she had stood him in the corner she would begin to cry herself over her evil, wicked nature, and little Nikolay, his sobs vying with hers, would come unbidden out of the corner to pull her wet hands from her face and try to comfort her. But the greatest, far the greatest of the princess\u0027s burdens was her father\u0027s irascibility, which was invariably directed against his daughter, and had of late reached the point of cruelty. Had he forced her to spend the night bowing to the ground, had he beaten her, or made her carry in wood and water, it would never have entered her head that her position was a hard one. But this loving despot—most cruel of all because he loved, and for that very reason tortured himself and her—knew not only how to mortify and humiliate her, but of set purpose, to prove to her that she was always to blame in everything. Of late he had taken a new departure, which caused Princess Marya more misery than anything—that was his closer and closer intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea, that had occurred to him in jest at the first moment of receiving the news of his son\u0027s intentions, that if Andrey got married he, too, would marry Mademoiselle Bourienne, obviously pleased him, and he had of late— simply, as Princess Marya fancied, to annoy her—persisted in being particularly gracious to Mademoiselle Bourienne and manifesting his dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love for the Frenchwoman.\\n\\n One day in Princess Marya\u0027s presence (it seemed to her that her father did it on purpose because she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne\u0027s hand, and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately. Princess Marya flushed hotly and ran out of the room. A few minutes later, Mademoiselle Bourienne went into Princess Marya\u0027s room, smiling and making some cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess Marya hastily wiped away her tears, with resolute steps went up to the Frenchwoman, and obviously unconscious of what she was doing, with wrathful haste and breaks in her voice she began screaming at her:\\n\\n “It\u0027s loathsome, vile, inhuman to take advantage of feebleness…” She could not go on. “Go out of my room,” she cried, and broke into sobs.\\n\\n The next day the old prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed that at dinner he gave orders for the dishes to be handed to Mademoiselle Bourienne first. When towards the end of dinner, the footman from habit handed the coffee, beginning with the princess, the old prince flew into a sudden frenzy of rage, flung his cane at Filipp, and immediately gave orders for him to be sent for a soldier.\\n\\n “He won\u0027t obey…twice I told him!…and he didn\u0027t obey. She\u0027s the first person in this house, she\u0027s my best friend,” screamed the old prince. And if you allow yourself,” he shouted in a fury, for the first time addressing Princess Marya, “ever again, as you dared yesterday … to forget yourself in her presence, I\u0027ll show you who is master in this house. Away! don\u0027t let me set eyes on you! Beg her pardon!”\\n\\n Princess Marya begged Amalia Yevgenyevna\u0027s pardon and also her father\u0027s, both for herself and the footman Filipp, who implored her intervention.\\n\\n At such moments the feeling that prevailed in Princess Marya\u0027s soul was akin to the pride of sacrifice. And all of a sudden at such moments, that father whom she was judging would look for his spectacles, fumbling by them and not seeing them, or would forget what had just happened, or would take a tottering step with his weak legs, and look round to see whether any one had noticed his feebleness, or what was worst of all, at dinner when there were no guests to excite him, he would suddenly fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate. “He is old and feeble, and I dare to judge him!” she thought, revolted by herself.\\n\\n 这一年公爵很显老了。他身上出现急剧衰老的征状：常常忽然入睡、对迩近发生的事体健忘，对久远的往事反而记得很牢，而且具有担任莫斯科的反对派首脑的稚气的虚荣，尽管如此，这个老者，尤其是每逢晚上就穿着一件短皮袄，戴着扑了香粉的假发出来饮茶，这时，只要一被人感动，他就断断续续地谈起往事来，或者更不连贯地、激烈地指责时弊，虽然如此，他仍能使全体客人对他怀有敬重之感。在来客看来，这一整幢旧式楼房，楼房中的偌大的穿衣镜、旧式家具、这些扑过香粉的仆人、这位上一世纪的固执而聪明的老者本人、他那崇敬他的温顺的女儿、貌美的法国女人，这一切构成了壮丽的令人悦意的景象。但是来客并没有想到，除开他们遇见主人们的两三小时而外，一昼夜尚有二十一、二小时，在这段时间，这个家庭正在过着家庭内部的秘密生活。在莫斯科，迩近的这种家庭内部生活对公爵小姐玛丽亚来说已经变得令她十分难受了。在莫斯科，她已经丧失了她的莫大的欢乐——在童山曾经使她精神充满的她与神亲们的谈话和孤独生活；她没有得到都市生活的任何益处和乐趣。她不去交际场所了，大家知道，她家父不让她独自一人外出，而他自己却因身体欠适不能出门，因此就没有人邀请她去出席宴会和晚会。公爵小姐玛丽亚对出阁这件事完全失望。她看见尼古拉·安德烈伊奇公爵流露着冷淡而凶恶的神情接待和送走那些偶尔前来造访的可以作为未婚夫的年轻人。公爵小姐玛丽亚没有朋友，此次抵达莫斯科，她对两个最亲近的朋友大为失望：其中一人是布里安小姐，公爵小姐原来就不能向她倾吐衷肠，现在觉得她十分可憎了，而且出于某些缘由，她开始回避她；另一个朋友就是朱莉，此人住在莫斯科，公爵小姐玛丽亚和她一连通过五年信，当公爵小姐玛丽亚和她重逢时，她觉得她完全生疏了。这时朱莉由于兄弟均已去世，已成为莫斯科最富有的未婚女子之一，她正处于社交界的极度欢乐之中。一些年轻人把她包围起来，她以为他们忽然赏识她的优点。朱莉处在社交界的秋娘半老的时期，她觉得出阁的最后时机已经来临，现在应该决定她的命运，否则就永远不能决定。公爵小姐玛丽亚每逢星期四就流露出忧郁的微笑，想起她现在没有什么人可以互通鱼雁，因为朱莉在这里，每星期和她会面，但是她的出现不能给她带来任何欢乐。她俨像一个拒绝娶那数年与其共度良宵的女人的老侨民，她觉得遗憾的是，朱莉在这里，她没有什么人可以互通鱼雁了。在莫斯科，公爵小姐玛丽亚没有什么人可以商淡，没有什么人可以倾诉自己的忧愁，而在这段时间内又增添了许多忧愁。安德烈公爵回家娶亲的日期临近了，他委托她让父亲作好思想准备这桩事不仅未能办妥，看来这件事反而给她搞糟了，一提及伯爵小姐罗斯托娃，老公爵就感到愠怒，他本来就时常心绪不安。公爵小姐玛丽亚近来又增添了忧愁，就是她给六岁的侄儿教课的事情。在她和尼古卢什卡的相互关系方面，她胆战心惊地发觉她自己也有她父亲那种容易动怒的性情。不管她有多少次对自己说，教侄子时不应该激怒，可是几乎每次当她执着教鞭坐下来教法语字母表时，她很想尽快地、轻易地把她自己的知识灌输给小孩，可是他心里害怕，亲眼看到他姑母就要发火了。每当孩子有点不用心，她就浑身颤栗，心里着急，怒气冲冲，并且提高了嗓门，有时抓着他的手，叫他站到屋角里去。当她叫侄子站到屋角里去了，她自己也由于凶恶的坏性子而大哭起来，尼古卢什卡也模仿她嚎啕大哭，未经她许可就从屋角里溜出来，走到她跟前，从她脸上挪开她那双被眼泪弄湿的手，安慰他姑母。然而她父亲经常对女儿大发雷霆，近来已经达到了残忍的地步，这也就最使公爵小姐感到苦恼。既然他强迫她夜夜作揖叩头，既然他揍她，强迫她搬柴、打水，而她连想也不会想到她的处境非常困难；但是这个疼爱女儿的折磨者之所以至为残忍，是因为他疼爱她而使他自己受折磨，也使她受折磨，他非但故意凌辱她，贬低她，而且向她表明，她在各方面都有过错。近来她身上又出现了一个最使公爵小姐玛丽亚感到苦恼的性格的特点，这就是他更加接近布里安小姐。在他接到儿子打算结婚的消息后，他脑海中开初浮现出一个开玩笑的念头：如果安德烈结婚，那末他就要娶布里安，很明显，这个念头使他感到心欢，公爵小姐玛丽亚仿佛觉得，为了侮辱她，他近来执着地对布里安小姐表示宠爱，而对女儿却表示不满。\\n\\n 有一次，在莫斯科，老公爵当着公爵小姐玛丽亚的面（她仿佛觉得，她父亲在她面前故意这样做）吻了吻布里安小姐的手，把她拉到身边，很亲热地拥抱她。公爵小姐玛丽亚涨红了脸，从房里跑出去了。几分钟以后，布里安小姐走到公爵小姐玛丽亚身边，面露微笑，用她那悦耳的嗓音快活地讲着什么事情。公爵小姐玛丽亚连忙揩掉眼泪，迈开坚定的脚步走到布里安跟前，显然，她自己也不知道是怎么回事，她带着愠怒和冲动的嗓音向法国女人大声喊叫起来：\\n\\n “这真卑鄙，真下流，惨无人道地利用……软弱，”她没有把话说完，“您从我房里走开。”她喊道，放声大哭起来。\\n\\n 第二天，公爵没有对他女儿道出一句话，但是她发现，吃午饭的时候他吩咐先给布里安小姐传菜。午餐结束时，当小吃部主管按照原有习惯又先给公爵小姐递上咖啡，于是公爵勃然大怒，把手杖掷到菲利普身上，并且马上吩咐送他去当兵。\\n\\n “没有听见……我说了两遍啊！……没有听见呀！她是这一家的为首的人，她是我的最好的朋友，”公爵喊道，“假如你胆敢，”他发火了，大声喊道，第一次把脸转向公爵小姐玛丽亚，“胆敢再像昨天那样……在她面前放肆，我就要给点颜色你看，要你知道谁是这家的主人。你滚，我不想见你，向她陪罪！”\\n\\n 公爵小姐玛丽亚为她自己，也为乞求庇护的小吃部主管菲利普向阿马利娅·叶夫根尼耶夫娜①和父亲陪罪。 \\n\\n ①阿马利娅·叶夫根尼耶夫娜是法国女人布里安的俄国名字和父称。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3441.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
