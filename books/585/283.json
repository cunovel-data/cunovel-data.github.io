{"id":41258,"no":283,"title":"Book 13 Chapter 9","content":"ON THE MILITARY SIDE, immediately on entering Moscow, Napoleon gives General Sebastiani strict orders to keep a watch on the movements of the Russian army, sends detachments along the various roads, and charges Murat to find Kutuzov. Then he gives careful instructions for the fortification of the Kremlin; then he makes a plan of the coming campaign over the whole map of Russia; that was a work of genius, indeed. On the diplomatic side, Napoleon summons to his presence Captain Yakovlev, who had been robbed and reduced to rags and did not know how to get out of Moscow, expounds to him minutely his whole policy and his magnanimity; and after writing a letter to the Emperor Alexander, in which he considers it his duty to inform his friend and brother that Rastoptchin had performed his duties very badly in Moscow, he despatches Yakovlev with it to Petersburg.\\n\\n Expounding his views and his magnanimity with equal minuteness to Tutolmin, he despatches that old man too to Petersburg to open negotiations.\\n\\n On the judicial side, orders were issued, immediately after the fires broke out, for the guilty persons to be found and executed. And the miscreant Rastoptchin was punished by the order to set fire to his houses.\\n\\n On the administrative side, Moscow was presented with a constitution. A municipal council was instituted, and the following proclamation was issued:—\\n\\n “CITIZENS OF MOSCOW!\\n\\n “Your misfortunes have been cruel, but his majesty the Emperor and King wishes to put an end to them. Terrible examples have shown you how he punishes crime and breach of discipline. Stern measures have been taken to put an end to disorder and to restore public security. A paternal council, chosen from among yourselves, will compose your municipality or town council. It will care for you, for your needs and your interests. The members of it will be distinguished by a red ribbon, which they will wear across the shoulder, and the mayor will wear a white sash over it. But except when discharging their duties, they will wear only a red ribbon round the left arm.\\n\\n “The city police are established on their former footing, and they are already restoring order. The government has appointed two general commissioners, or superintendents of police, and twenty commissioners, or police inspectors, stationed in the different quarters of the town. You will recognise them by the white ribbon they will wear round the left arm. Several churches of various denominations have been opened, and divine service is performed in them without hindrance. Your fellow-citizens are returning every day to their dwellings, and orders have been given that they should find in them the aid and protection due to misfortune. These are the measures which the government has adopted to restore order and alleviate your position; but to attain that end, it is necessary that you should unite your efforts with them; should forget, if possible, the misfortunes you have suffered; should look hopefully at a fate that is not so cruel; should believe that a shameful death inevitably awaits those guilty of violence against your persons or your deserted property, and consequently leaves no doubt that they will be preserved, since such is the will of the greatest and most just of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens of whatever nation you may be! Restore public confidence, the source of the prosperity of a state; live like brothers, give mutual aid and protection to one another; unite in confounding the projects of the evil-minded; obey the civil and military authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow.”\\n\\n On the commissariat side, Napoleon issued orders for all the troops to enter Moscow in turn, à la maraude, to gather supplies for themselves; so that in that way the army was provided with supplies for the future.\\n\\n On the religious side, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back, and services to be performed again in the churches.\\n\\n With a view to encouraging commerce and providing supplies for the troops, the following notice was placarded everywhere:—\\n\\n “PROCLAMATION.\\n\\n “You, peaceable inhabitants of Moscow, artisans, and working men, who have been driven out of the city by the disturbance, and you, scattered tillers of the soil, who are still kept in the fields by groundless terror, hear! Tranquillity is returning to this capital, and order is being restored in it. Your fellow-countrymen are coming boldly out of their hiding-places, seeing that they are treated with respect. Every act of violence against them or their property is promptly punished. His Majesty the Emperor and King protects them, and he reckons none among you his enemies but such as disobey his commands. He wishes to put an end to your trouble, and to bring you back to your homes and your families. Co-operate with his beneficent designs and come to us without apprehension. Citizens! Return with confidence to your habitations; you will soon find the means of satisfying your needs! Artisans and industrious handicraftsmen! Return to your employment; houses, shops, and guards to protect them are awaiting you, and you will receive the payment due to you for your toil! And you, too, peasants, come out of the forests where you have been hiding in terror, return without fear to your huts in secure reliance on finding protection. Markets have been established in the city, where peasants can bring their spare stores and country produce. The government has taken the following measures to secure freedom of sale for them: (1) From this day forward, peasants, husbandmen, and inhabitants of the environs of Moscow can, without any danger, bring their goods of any kind to two appointed markets—namely, the Mohovaya and the Ohotny Ryad. (2) Goods shall be bought from them at such a price as seller and buyer shall agree upon together; but if the seller cannot get what he asks for as a fair price, he will be at liberty to take his goods back to his village, and no one can hinder his doing so on any pretext whatever. (3) Every Sunday and Wednesday are fixed for weekly market days: to that end a sufficient number of troops will be stationed on Tuesdays and Saturdays along all the high roads at such a distance from the town as to protect the carts coming in. (4) Similar measures will be taken that the peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their homeward way. (5) Steps will be immediately taken to re-establish the ordinary shops.\\n\\n “Inhabitants of the city and of the country, and you workmen and handicraftsmen of whatever nationality you may be! You are called upon to carry out the paternal designs of his majesty the Emperor and King, and to co-operate with him for the public welfare. Lay your respect and confidence at his feet, and do not delay to unite with us!”\\n\\n With a view to keeping up the spirits of the troops and the people, reviews were continually being held, and rewards were distributed.\\n\\n The Emperor rode about the streets and entertained the inhabitants; and in spite of his preoccupation with affairs of state, visited in person the theatre set up by his orders.\\n\\n As regards philanthropy, too—the fairest jewel in the conqueror\u0027s crown—Napoleon did everything that lay within him. On the benevolent institutions he ordered the inscription to be put up, “Maison de ma mère,” thereby combining a touching filial sentiment with a monarch\u0027s grandeur of virtue. He visited the Foundling Home; and as he gave the orphans he had saved his white hands to kiss, he conversed graciously with Tutolmin. Then, as Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers\u0027 pay to be distributed among them in the false Russian notes he had counterfeited:—\\n\\n “Reinforcing the use of these methods by an act worthy of him and of the French army, he had assistance distributed to those who had suffered loss from the fire. But as provisions were too precious to be given to strangers, mostly enemies, Napoleon preferred to furnish them with money for them to provide themselves from without, and ordered paper roubles to be distributed among them.”\\n\\n With a view to maintaining discipline in the army, orders were continually being issued for severely punishing nonfulfilment of military duty and for putting an end to pillaging.\\n\\n ①近卫军上尉雅可夫列夫是著名作家亚历山大·赫尔岑的父亲。\\n\\n 在行政方面，他赐给莫斯科一部宪法，成立市政府，颁发了如下告示：\\n\\n 莫斯科的居民们！\\n\\n 你们的不幸是残酷的，但是皇帝陛下和国王将要制\\n\\n 止这些不幸的发展。可怕的例子已经教训你们，他是怎样惩治那些反抗和违法行为的。采取严厉措施是为了制止骚乱和恢复社会治安。由你们自己人中间选出来的元老们，将组成市政府，或者叫市政管理局。它将要照顾你们，关心你们的需要，关心你们的利益。这些行政人员以肩佩一条红色带子为标记，市长则外加一条白色带子。在公余期间，他们左臂只缠一条红色带子。\\n\\n 市警察局已经按原有规章建立起来，由于它的活动，秩序已经好转，政府已经任命了两个总监，或称警察局长！市内各区任命了二十名区监，或称警察所长，你们看见左臂缠白带子的就是他们。几个不同教派的教堂已经开放，可以自由地做礼拜。你们的同胞每天都有回来的，已经发布命令：由于他们的不幸，他们在家中应当得到保护和帮助。这就是政府为了恢复秩序和改善你们的处境所采取的措施；但是，若要达到这个目的，要紧的是，你们必须和他们联合起来共同努力，如果可能的话，忘掉你们所遭受的不幸，寄希望于较好的命运，应当相信，凡是侵犯你们的身体和你们剩余财产的人，一定逃脱不了可耻的死刑，最后，你们不应当怀疑，你们的生命财产一定会得到保障，因为，这是最伟大最公正的君主的旨意。不论属于哪个民族的士兵们和居民们！作为一个国家幸福源泉的公众的信任要恢复，要像兄弟一般生活，互相帮助和保护，联合起来挫败坏人的企图，服从军政当局，你们不久就可以不再流泪了。\\n\\n 在军队给养方面，拿破仑告示全体官兵，命令全体官兵一路àlamaraude①按次序进入莫斯科，为他们自己取得粮军，以便在未来军队不愁给养。\\n\\n 在宗教方面，拿破仑命令ramenerlespopes②，教堂恢复做礼拜。 \\n\\n ①法语：洗劫。\\n\\n ②法语：召回神甫。\\n\\n 布告\\n\\n 你们，莫斯科的安份守己的居民们，被不幸赶出城外的工匠们和工人们，以及由于无缘无故的恐惧至今仍在野外流离失所的农民们，听着！现在的古都又平静了，秩序也恢复了，你们的同胞见到他们受到尊敬，就勇敢地从他们隐藏的地方出现了。任何侵犯他们人身和他们的财产的暴行，都将立即受到惩罚。皇帝陛下和国王保护他们。认为在你们中间，除了那些违抗他的命令的人，没有一个人是他的敌人。他要结束你们的不幸，使你们返回家园与亲人团聚。因此，遵从他的仁慈的旨意，消除一切顾虑，回到我们这里来吧。居民们！满怀信赖地回到你们的住处：你们的需要很快会得到满足！工匠们和勤劳的工人们，返回你们的工作地点，你们的家，你们的作坊吧，那里有保安措施，都在等待着你们，你们的工作将得到应得的报酬！最后，还有你们，农民们，从你们躲藏的森林里出来吧，你们回家去，不用害怕，你们完全可以相信，你们会得到保护。城里已经设了许多粮店，农民可以把多余的粮食和土产品运到那里。政府已经订出下列措施，保证他们可以自由买卖：（一）自即日起，农民、庄户人以及莫斯科近郊的老百姓，可以将各种产品毫无危险地运到城内两个指定的市场，其中一个在莫霍夫街，另一个在奥霍特内伊市场。（二）产品由买卖双方自由议价，卖方如对价格不合意，可将产品运回农村，任何人不得以任何借口加以阻挠。（三）每逢星期天和星期三定为逢大集，因此，每星期二和星期六将派出足够数量的军队在城外各条大路上保护运货车辆。\\n\\n （四）将采取同样的措施，使农民及其车马在归途中通行无阻。（五）立即采取恢复正常贸易的措施。本市和各村的居民，以及你们，工人们和工匠们，不论你们属于哪个民族，号召你们，实现皇帝陛下和国王的仁慈的旨意，谋求公共的福利。匍伏在他的脚下表示敬意和信任，赶快同我们·联·合起来吧！”\\n\\n 为了鼓舞和提高部队和人民的精神，不断地举行检阅和颁奖。皇帝骑着马巡视街道，安抚居民，他虽然操劳着国家大事，仍然亲临他下令建立的剧院看戏。\\n\\n 在慈善事业方面（慈善事业是君王最高的德政）拿破仑也做了他所能做的一切事情。他吩咐在慈善院的建筑物上书写“Maisondemamère”①几个大字，这样，就把做儿子的孝敬之情和浩荡的皇恩结合起来了。他参观孤儿院，他让他所拯救的孤儿吻他那双白净的手，和蔼地和图托尔明谈话。随后，据梯也尔花言巧语地叙述，他命令把他伪造的俄国钞票发给他的士兵们作为薪饷。Relevantl\u0027emploidecesmoyensparunactedignedeluietdel\u0027arméefrancaise，ilfitdistribuerdessecoursauxincendiés．Maislesvivresétanttropprécieuxpourêtredonnésàdesétrangerslaplupartennemis，Napoléonaimamieuxleurfournirdel\u0027argentàfinqu\u0027ilssefournissentauxdehors，etilleurfitdistribuerdesroublespapiers．② \\n\\n ①法语：吾母之家。\\n\\n ②法语：以无愧于他和法军的行动进一步扩大这些措施，他命令给烧光的人家以补助。但因食品太珍贵，不发给怀有敌意的外国人，拿破仑认为最好把钱发给他们，让他们自己到处去寻找食物，因此他命令发给他们纸卢布。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3581.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
