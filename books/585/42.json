{"id":41017,"no":42,"title":"Book 2 Chapter 17","content":"PRINCE ANDREY mounted his horse but lingered at the battery, looking at the smoke of the cannon from which the ball had flown. His eyes moved rapidly over the wide plain. He only saw that the previously immobile masses of the French were heaving to and fro, and that it really was a battery on the left. The smoke still clung about it. Two Frenchmen on horseback, doubtless adjutants, were galloping on the hill. A small column of the enemy, distinctly visible, were moving downhill, probably to strengthen the line. The smoke of the first shot had not cleared away, when there was a fresh puff of smoke and another shot. The battle was beginning. Prince Andrey turned his horse and galloped back to Grunte to look for Prince Bagration. Behind him he heard the cannonade becoming louder and more frequent. Our men were evidently beginning to reply. Musket shots could be heard below at the spot where the lines were closest. Lemarrois had only just galloped to Murat with Napoleon\u0027s menacing letter, and Murat, abashed and anxious to efface his error, at once moved his forces to the centre and towards both flanks, hoping before evening and the arrival of the Emperor to destroy the insignificant detachment before him. “It has begun! Here it comes!” thought Prince Andrey, feeling the blood rush to his heart. “But where? What form is my Toulon to take?” he wondered. Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere nothing but the same rapid movements of soldiers forming in ranks and getting their guns, and on every face he saw the same eagerness that he felt in his heart. “It has begun! Here it comes! Terrible and delightful!” said the face of every private and officer. Before he reached the earthworks that were being thrown up, he saw in the evening light of the dull autumn day men on horseback crossing towards him. The foremost, wearing a cloak and an Astrachan cap, was riding on a white horse. It was Prince Bagration. Prince Andrey stopped and waited for him to come up. Prince Bagration stopped his horse, and recognising Prince Andrey nodded to him. He still gazed on ahead while Prince Andrey told him what he had been seeing. The expression: “It has begun! it is coming!” was discernible even on Prince Bagration\u0027s strong, brown face, with his half-closed, lustreless, sleepy-looking eyes. Prince Andrey glanced with uneasy curiosity at that impassive face, and he longed to know: Was that man thinking and feeling, and what was he thinking and feeling at that moment? “Is there anything at all there behind that impassive face?” Prince Andrey wondered, looking at him. Prince Bagration nodded in token of his assent to Prince Andrey\u0027s words, and said: “Very good,” with an expression that seemed to signify that all that happened, and all that was told him, was exactly what he had foreseen. Prince Andrey, panting from his rapid ride, spoke quickly. Prince Bagration uttered his words in his Oriental accent with peculiar deliberation, as though impressing upon him that there was no need of hurry. He did, however, spur his horse into a gallop in the direction of Tushin\u0027s battery. Prince Andrey rode after him with his suite. The party consisted of an officer of the suite, Bagration\u0027s private adjutant, Zherkov, an orderly officer, the staff-officer on duty, riding a beautiful horse of English breed, and a civilian official, the auditor, who had asked to be present from curiosity to see the battle. The auditor, a plump man with a plump face, looked about him with a na?ve smile of amusement, swaying about on his horse, and cutting a queer figure in his cloak on his saddle among the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants. “This gentleman wants to see a battle,” said Zherkov to Bolkonsky, indicating the auditor, “but has begun to feel queer already.” “Come, leave off,” said the auditor, with a beaming smile at once na?ve and cunning, as though he were flattered at being the object of Zherkov\u0027s jests, and was purposely trying to seem stupider than he was in reality. “It\u0027s very curious, mon Monsieur Prince,” said the staff-officer on duty. (He vaguely remembered that the title prince was translated in some peculiar way in French, but could not get it quite right.) By this time they were all riding up to Tushin\u0027s battery, and a ball struck the ground before them. “What was that falling?” asked the auditor, smiling na?vely. “A French pancake,” said Zherkov. “That\u0027s what they hit you with, then?” asked the auditor. “How awful!” And he seemed to expand all over with enjoyment. He had hardly uttered the words when again there was a sudden terrible whiz, which ended abruptly in a thud into something soft, and flop—a Cossack, riding a little behind and to the right of the auditor, dropped from his horse to the ground. Zherkov and the staff-officer bent forward over their saddles and turned their horses away. The auditor stopped facing the Cossack, and looking with curiosity at him. The Cossack was dead, the horse was still struggling. Prince Bagration dropped his eyelids, looked round, and seeing the cause of the delay, turned away indifferently, seeming to ask, “Why notice these trivial details?” With the ease of a first-rate horseman he stopped his horse, bent over a little and disengaged his sabre, which had caught under his cloak. The sabre was an old-fashioned one, unlike what are worn now. Prince Andrey remembered the story that Suvorov had given his sabre to Bagration in Italy, and the recollection was particularly pleasant to him at that moment. They had ridden up to the very battery from which Prince Andrey had surveyed the field of battle. “Whose company?” Prince Bagration asked of the artilleryman standing at the ammunition boxes. He asked in words: “Whose company?” but what he was really asking was, “You\u0027re not in a panic here?” And the artilleryman understood that. “Captain Tushin\u0027s, your excellency,” the red-haired, freckled artilleryman sang out in a cheerful voice, as he ducked forward. “To be sure, to be sure,” said Bagration, pondering something, and he rode by the platforms up to the end cannon. Just as he reached it, a shot boomed from the cannon, deafening him and his suite, and in the smoke that suddenly enveloped the cannon the artillerymen could be seen hauling at the cannon, dragging and rolling it back to its former position. A broad-shouldered, gigantic soldier, gunner number one, with a mop, darted up to the wheel and planted himself, his legs wide apart; while number two, with a shaking hand, put the charge into the cannon\u0027s mouth; a small man with stooping shoulders, the officer Tushin, stumbling against the cannon, dashed forward, not noticing the general, and looked out, shading his eyes with his little hand. “Another two points higher, and it will be just right,” he shouted in a shrill voice, to which he tried to give a swaggering note utterly out of keeping with his figure. “Two!” he piped. “Smash away, Medvyedev!” Bagration called to the officer, and Tushin went up to the general, putting three fingers to the peak of his cap with a timid and awkward gesture, more like a priest blessing some one than a soldier saluting. Though Tushin\u0027s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was throwing shells over the village of Sch?ngraben, in part of which immense masses of French soldiers were moving out. No one had given Tushin instructions at what or with what to fire, and after consulting his sergeant, Zaharchenko, for whom he had a great respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the village. “Very good!” Bagration said, on the officer\u0027s submitting that he had done so, and he began scrutinising the whole field of battle that lay unfolded before him. He seemed to be considering something. The French had advanced nearest on the right side. In the hollow where the stream flowed, below the eminence on which the Kiev regiment was stationed, could be heard a continual roll and crash of guns, the din of which was overwhelming. And much further to the right, behind the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed out to Bagration a column of French outflanking our flank. On the left the horizon was bounded by the copse close by. Prince Bagration gave orders for two battalions from the centre to go to the right to reinforce the flank. The officer of the suite ventured to observe to the prince that the removal of these battalions would leave the cannon unprotected. Prince Bagration turned to the officer of the suite and stared at him with his lustreless eyes in silence. Prince Andrey thought that the officer\u0027s observation was a very just one, and that really there was nothing to be said in reply. But at that instant an adjutant galloped up with a message from the colonel of the regiment in the hollow that immense masses of the French were coming down upon them, that his men were in disorder and retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagration nodded to signify his assent and approval. He rode at a walking pace to the right, and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French. But the adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the colonel of the dragoons had already retired beyond the ravine, as a destructive fire had been opened upon him, and he was losing his men for nothing, and so he had concentrated his men in the wood. “Very good!” said Bagration. Just as he was leaving the battery, shots had been heard in the wood on the left too; and as it was too far to the left flank for him to go himself, Prince Bagration despatched Zherkov to tell the senior general—the general whose regiment had been inspected by Kutuzov at Braunau—to retreat as rapidly as possible beyond the ravine, as the right flank would probably not long be able to detain the enemy. Tushin, and the battalion that was to have defended his battery, was forgotten. Prince Andrey listened carefully to Prince Bagration\u0027s colloquies with the commanding officers, and to the orders he gave them, and noticed, to his astonishment, that no orders were really given by him at all, but that Prince Bagration confined himself to trying to appear as though everything that was being done of necessity, by chance, or at the will of individual officers, was all done, if not by his order, at least in accordance with his intentions. Prince Andrey observed, however, that, thanks to the tact shown by Prince Bagration, notwithstanding that what was done was due to chance, and not dependent on the commander\u0027s will, his presence was of the greatest value. Commanding officers, who rode up to Bagration looking distraught, regained their composure; soldiers and officers greeted him cheerfully, recovered their spirits in his presence, and were unmistakably anxious to display their pluck before him. 勒马鲁瓦携带着波拿巴的一封望而生畏的书信刚刚驰至缪拉处，心中有愧的缪拉想痛改前非，于是立刻将部队调至中央阵地，并向左右两翼迂回，希望在傍晚皇帝驾到之前粉碎自己面前的一小股敌军。 “你瞧，战斗开始了！”安德烈公爵想道，他觉得身上的血液开始更急速地涌上心房。“可是在哪里战斗？怎样才能把我的‘土伦\u0027表现出来呢？”他想道。 他从一刻钟以前还在吃稀饭、喝伏特加酒的那几个连队中间经过时，他到处看见正在排队和拿起火枪的士兵们的同样敏捷的动作，他从大家的脸上发觉他心中体察到的那种兴奋的感情。“你瞧，战斗开始了！既可怕，又快活！”每一名士兵和军官的面部表情都证明了这一层。 他还没有走到修筑防御工事的地方，他就在那阴沉沉的秋日的夕照中看见向他迎面走来的几个骑马的人。领头的人披着斗篷，戴着羔皮阔边帽，正骑着一匹白马。他是巴格拉季翁公爵。安德烈公爵停下，等候他。巴格拉季翁公爵勒住马，认出安德烈公爵，向他点头致意。当安德烈公爵把目睹的情形告诉他时，他继续观察前方。 “战斗开始了”这句话甚至在巴格拉季翁那副坚定的棕色的面孔上表露出来了，他的一双不明亮的眼睛半睁半瞌，仿佛没有睡够似的。安德烈公爵焦急不安地好奇地凝视着这副呆板的面孔，他很想弄明白，他是否在思考，是否在体察，这个人在这种时刻会思索什么，产生什么感觉？“总而言之，在这副呆板的面孔后面是否隐藏着什么？”安德烈公爵一面望着他，一面向自己提出这个问题。巴格拉季翁公爵颔颔首，表示赞同安德烈公爵的话，他接着说道：“很好。”这种神态就像这里发生的一切、向他汇报的一切，正是他已经预见到的。安德烈公爵说得很快，但由于急速的骑行，气喘吁吁。巴格拉季翁公爵带着俄国东部的口音说话，说得特别慢，好像向人家暗示，用不着赶到什么地方去。但是他仍向图申主管的炮台策马疾驰。安德烈公爵偕同侍从们跟在他后面骑行。跟随巴格拉季翁公爵身后的有下列人员：侍从武官——公爵的私人副官热尔科夫、传令军官、骑一匹英国式的短尾良驹的值日校官、一名文官——检察官。此人出于好奇而请求参战，奔赴前线。检察官是个肥胖的男子汉，圆圆的脸膛，带着天真而快活的微笑，他环顾四遭，骑着马儿晃晃悠悠，在那辎重兵团的鞍子上露出他的一件有条纹的细丝厚毛军大衣，他正置身于骠骑兵、哥萨克兵和副官之中，现出一副怪模样。 “瞧，他想看看打仗，”热尔科夫指着检察官，对博尔孔斯基说道，“可是他的心窝上痛起来了。” “得啦吧，你甭说了。”检察官面露喜悦、天真而狡黠地微笑，说道，仿佛他感到荣幸的是，他已成为热尔科夫谈笑的对象，仿佛他故意装出一副比他实际上更愚蠢的样子。 “Tresdrole，monmonsieurprince，”①值日校官说道。 ①法语：我的公爵先生，真够开心啊。 这时候他们都已驶近图申主管的炮台，一枚炮弹落在他们前面了。 “什么东西落下来了？”检察官幼稚地微露笑容，问道。 “法国薄饼。”热尔科夫说。 “就是说，用这个东西打吗？”检察官问道，“厉害极了！” 他好像高兴得快要丧失自制力了。他话音刚刚落地，忽然又响起一阵可怕的呼啸，不知撞着什么不结实的东西，呼啸声停止了，在离检察官左后方不远的地方，一名骑马的哥萨克兵扑通一声，连人带马倒在地上了。热尔科夫和值日校官贴近马鞍弯下腰来，调转马头跑开了。检察官在哥萨克兵对面停下来，集中注意力、好奇地审视着他。哥萨克兵死去了，马还在挣扎。 巴格拉季翁公爵眯缝起眼睛，环顾四周，发现了慌乱的原因之后，便漠不关心地转过身去，他仿佛在说：“不值得去干蠢事！”他勒住马，做出善骑者的姿势，微微地弯下身子，把那挂住斗篷的长剑弄正。长剑是古式的，而不是目前军人佩戴的长剑。安德烈公爵想起苏沃洛夫在意大利把长剑赠送巴格拉季翁的故事，这时回想起来他觉得特别高兴。他们向炮台前面驰去，博尔孔斯基甫才瞭望战场时，就站在炮台的近旁。 “是谁的连队？”巴格拉季翁公爵问一个站在炮弹箱旁边的炮兵士官。 他问道：“谁的连队？”其实他要问的是：“你们在这儿是不是胆怯呢？”炮兵士官懂得他的意思。 “大人，这是图申上尉的连队。”棕红色头发、满脸雀斑的炮兵士官挺直胸膛，带着愉快的嗓音喊道。 “好，好。”巴格拉季翁说道，心中琢磨着什么事，经过前车向紧靠边上的那门大炮驰去。 当他快要走到时，这门大炮中传出隆隆的炮声，把他和侍从们震得发聋，在那骤然缭绕大炮的硝烟中，可以看见，几名托着大炮的炮兵，他们急忙地使尽全力，将大炮推回原位。肩膀宽阔的魁梧的一号炮手拿着洗膛杆，两腿叉得很宽，跳到轮子前面；二号炮手伸出巍颤颤的手将火药装入炮筒。身材矮小、有点佝偻的图申军官，在炮尾架上绊了一跤，他向前跑去，没有注意将军用一只小手搭起凉棚，不时地向外张望。 “再加两俄分，这样就恰恰适合了，”他用尖细的嗓音喊道，竭力地使他的嗓音富有与其体型不相称的英雄气概，“第二号，”他尖声地说，“梅德韦杰夫，歼灭敌人！” 巴格拉季翁把那名军官喊过来，图申的动作显得胆怯而且笨拙，根本不像军人那样行礼，却像神甫祝福一般，他将三个指头贴近帽檐，向将军面前走去。虽然图申的大炮是用以扫射细谷的，但是他却用燃烧弹射击前面望得见的申格拉本村，那是因为有大批大批的法军在村前挺进的缘故。 没有人命令图申应向何方射击用什么射击，他只是同他所尊重的上士扎哈尔琴科商量了一下，便拿定主意：焚烧村庄是上策。“很好！”巴格拉季翁听了军官的汇报后说道，他开始仔细地观察在他面前展现的战场，仿佛心中琢磨着什么。法国官兵从右边推进，离他们最近。基辅兵团驻守于高地，高地下面的河谷中可以听见令人心惊胆战的时断时续的噼噼啪啪的枪声，右面很远的地方，在龙骑兵后面，一名侍从军官向公爵指着包抄我军侧翼的法军纵队。左边的地平线上可以望见附近的森林边缘地带。巴格拉季翁公爵命令两个营从中央阵地向右面推进，去救援兄弟部队。一名侍从军官敢于批评公爵，指出两个营队调走之后，大炮势必缺乏掩护了。巴格拉季翁公爵把脸转向侍从军官，用那无神的目光默默地朝他瞥了一眼。安德烈公爵仿佛觉得，侍从军官的意见提得正确，确实无二话可说。但在这时候，一名副官从驻守谷地的团长那里疾驰而至，带来了消息：大批大批的法军从山下推进，一个兵团已经崩溃，正向基辅掷弹兵部队方向撤退。巴格拉季翁公爵颔颔首，表示赞许。他向右方骑马缓行，将一名副官派至龙骑兵部队，并下令进攻法国军队。但是派往那处的副官过了半个小时就回头，传来了信息：龙骑兵团团长已经撤退到峡谷后面去了，因为他面对猛烈的火力，白白地丧失人丁，因此命令步兵下马进入森林中。 “很好！”巴格拉季翁说道。 当他骑马离开炮台时，左边森林中也可以听见枪炮声，因为离左翼太远，连他自己也来不及准时到达，他——巴格拉季翁公爵便派热尔科夫到那里去告知那个在布劳瑙请求库图佐夫给予兵团奖励的老将军，叫他尽快撤退到峡谷后面去，因为右翼大概不能长久地阻击敌军的缘故。图申和掩护他的一个营已被置于脑后了。安德烈公爵仔细地倾听巴格拉季翁公爵和首长们的谈话，倾听他所颁布的命令，值得惊讶的是，他已经发现，没有颁布任何命令，巴格拉季翁公爵只是极力地装出，仿佛这一切事情的发生都是出于必然或偶然，或出于个别首长的意志，这种种事情的发生虽未遵照他的命令，却是符合他的意愿的。因为巴格拉季翁公爵待人接物有分寸，所以安德烈公爵注意到，各种事件的发生都带有偶然性，是不以首长的意志为转移的，但是首长的出席带来了许多裨益。首长们流露出惊惶的面部表情，但是一走到巴格拉季翁公爵面前时，都变得很镇静了。士兵和军官们高高兴兴地向他致意，在他眼前，都变得更有活力了，显然他们都要向他炫示一下自己的勇敢。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3340.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
