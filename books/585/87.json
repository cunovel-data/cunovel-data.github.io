{"id":41062,"no":87,"title":"Book 5 Chapter 6","content":"PIERRE\u0027S DUEL with Dolohov was smoothed over, and in spite of the Tsar\u0027s severity in regard to duels at that time, neither the principals nor the seconds suffered for it. But the scandal of the duel, confirmed by Pierre\u0027s rupture with his wife, made a great noise in society. Pierre had been looked upon with patronising condescension when he was an illegitimate son; he had been made much of and extolled for his virtues while he was the wealthiest match in the Russian empire; but after his marriage, when young ladies and their mothers had nothing to hope from him, he had fallen greatly in the opinion of society, especially as he had neither the wit nor the wish to ingratiate himself in public favour. Now the blame of the whole affair was thrown on him; it was said that he was insanely jealous, and subject to the same fits of blood-thirsty fury as his father had been. And when, after Pierre\u0027s departure, Ellen returned to Petersburg, she was received by all her acquaintances not only cordially, but with a shade of deference that was a tribute to her distress. When the conversation touched upon her husband, Ellen assumed an expression of dignity, which her characteristic tact prompted her to adopt, though she had no conception of its significance. That expression suggested that she had resolved to bear her affliction without complaint, and that her husband was a cross God had laid upon her. Prince Vassily expressed his opinion more openly. He shrugged his shoulders when the conversation turned upon Pierre, and pointing to his forehead, said:\n “Crackbrained, I always said so.”\n “I used to say so even before,” Anna Pavlovna would say of Pierre, “at the time I said at once and before every one” (she insisted on her priority) “that he was an insane young man, corrupted by the dissolute ideas of the age. I used to say so at the time when every one was in such ecstasies over him; and he had only just come home from abroad, and do you remember at one of my soirées he thought fit to pose as a sort of Marat? And how has it ended? Even then I was against this marriage, and foretold all that has come to pass.”\n Anna Pavlovna used still to give soirées on her free days as before, soirées such as only she had the gift of arranging, soirées at which were gathered “the cream of really good society, the flower of the intellectual essence of Petersburg society,” as Anna Pavlovna herself used to say. Besides this fine sifting of the society, Anna Pavlovna\u0027s soirées were further distinguished by some new interesting person, secured by the hostess on every occasion for the entertainment of the company. Moreover, the point on the political thermometer, at which the temperature of loyal court society stood in Petersburg, was nowhere so clearly and unmistakably marked as at these soirées.\n Towards the end of the year 1806, when all the melancholy details of Napoleon\u0027s destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstadt, and the surrender of the greater number of the Prussian forts, had arrived, when our troops were already entering Prussia, and our second war with Napoleon was beginning, Anna Pavlovna was giving one of her soirées. “The cream of really good society” consisted of the fascinating and unhappy Ellen, abandoned by her husband; of Mortemart; of the fascinating Prince Ippolit, who had just come home from Vienna; of two diplomats, of the old aunt; of a young man, always referred to in that society by the designation, “a man of a great deal of merit …”; of a newly appointed maid of honour and her mother, and several other less noteworthy persons.\n The novelty Anna Pavlovna was offering her guests for their entertainment that evening was Boris Drubetskoy, who had just arrived as a special messenger from the Prussian army, and was in the suite of a personage of very high rank.\n What the political thermometer indicated at that soirée was something as follows: All the European rulers and generals may do their utmost to flatter Bonaparte with the object of causing me and us generally these annoyances and mortifications, but our opinion in regard to Bonaparte can undergo no change. We do not cease giving undisguised expression to our way of thinking on the subject, and can only say to the Prussian king and others: “So much the worse for you.” “Tu l\u0027as voulu, George Dandin,” that\u0027s all we can say. This was what the political thermometer indicated at Anna Pavlovna\u0027s soirée. When Boris, who was to be offered up to the guests, came into the drawing-room, almost all the company had assembled, and the conversation, guided by Anna Pavlovna, was of our diplomatic relations with Austria, and the hope of an alliance with her.\n Boris, fresh, rosy, and manlier looking, walked easily into the drawing-room, wearing the elegant uniform of an adjutant. He was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt, and then joined the general circle.\n Anna Pavlovna gave him her shrivelled hand to kiss, introduced him to several persons whom he did not know, and gave him a whispered description of each of them. “Prince Ippolit Kuragin, M. Krug, chargé d\u0027affaires from Copenhagen, a profound intellect and simple, M. Shitov, a man of a great deal of merit …” this of the young man always so spoken of.\n Thanks to the efforts of Anna Mihalovna, his own tastes and the peculiarities of his reserved character, Boris had succeeded by that time in getting into a very advantageous position in the service. He was an adjutant in the suite of a personage of very high rank, he had received a very important commission in Prussia, and had only just returned thence as a special messenger. He had completely assimilated that unwritten code which had so pleased him at Olmütz, that code in virtue of which a lieutenant may stand infinitely higher than a general, and all that is needed for success in the service is not effort, not work, not gallantry, not perseverance, but simply the art of getting on with those who have the bestowal of promotion, and he often himself marvelled at the rapidity of his own progress, and that others failed to grasp the secret of it. His whole manner of life, all his relations with his old friends, all his plans for the future were completely transformed in consequence of this discovery. He was not well off, but he spent his last copeck to be better dressed than others. He would have deprived himself of many pleasures rather than have allowed himself to drive in an inferior carriage, or to be seen in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform. He sought the acquaintance and cultivated the friendship only of persons who were in a higher position, and could consequently be of use to him. He loved Petersburg and despised Moscow. His memories of the Rostov household and his childish passion for Natasha were distasteful to him, and he had not once been at the Rostovs\u0027 since he had entered the army. In Anna Pavlovna\u0027s drawing-room, his entry into which he looked upon as an important step upward in the service, he at once took his cue, and let Anna Pavlovna make the most of what interest he had to offer, while himself attentively watching every face and appraising the advantages and possibilities of intimacy with every one of the persons present. He sat on the seat indicated to him beside the fair Ellen and listened to the general conversation.\n “Vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that not even a continuance of the most brilliant successes would put them within reach, and doubts whether any means could gain them for us. These are the actual words of the ministry in Vienna,” said the Danish chargé d\u0027affaires.\n “It is polite of them to doubt,” said the man of profound intellect with a subtle smile.\n “We must distinguish between the ministry in Vienna and the Emperor of Austria,” said Mortemart. “The Emperor of Austria can never have thought of such a thing; it is only the ministers who say it.”\n “Ah, my dear vicomte,” put in Anna Pavlovna; “Europe will never be our sincere ally.”\n Then Anna Pavlovna turned the conversation upon the courage and firmness of the Prussian king, with the object of bringing Boris into action.\n Boris listened attentively to the person who was speaking, and waited for his turn, but meanwhile he had leisure to look round several times at the fair Ellen, who several times met the handsome young adjutant\u0027s eyes with a smile.\n Very naturally, speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna Pavlovna asked Boris to describe his journey to Glogau, and the position in which he had found the Prussian army. Boris in his pure, correct French, told them very deliberately a great many interesting details about the armies, and the court, studiously abstaining from any expression of his own opinion in regard to the facts he was narrating. For some time Boris engrossed the whole attention of the company, and Anna Pavlovna felt that the novelty she was serving her guests was being accepted by them all with pleasure. Of all the party, the person who showed most interest in Boris\u0027s description was Ellen. She asked him several questions about his expedition, and seemed to be extremely interested in the position of the Prussian army. As soon as he had finished, she turned to him with her habitual smile.\n “You absolutely must come and see me,” she said in a tone that suggested that for certain considerations, of which he could have no knowledge, it was absolutely essential. “On Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.”\n Boris promised to do so, and was about to enter into conversation with her, when Anna Pavlovna drew him aside on the pretext that her aunt wished to hear his story.\n “You know her husband, of course?” said Anna Pavlovna, dropping her eyelids, and with a melancholy gesture indicating Ellen. “Ah, such an unhappy and exquisite woman! Don\u0027t speak of him before her; pray, don\u0027t speak of him. It\u0027s too much for her!”\n “Un　cerveau　fê\u0027lé－je　le　diasais　toujours．①”\n “我事先说了，”安娜·帕夫洛夫娜论及皮埃尔时说，“那时候我最先讲话（她坚决要求领先发言），这是个狂妄的、被时代的淫乱思想毁坏了的青年人。当大家都在赞扬他时，他刚从国外回来，你们还记得，有一天晚上他在我那儿把自己装成马拉（雅各宾派的领袖之一）模样的时候，我就说了这番话。结果怎样呢？我那时还不希望办成这件婚事，我把以后发生的事预先说了。”\n 安娜·帕夫洛夫娜在空闲的日子照旧在自己家里举办晚会，像从前一样，举办那唯独她一人具有才华去举办的晚会，正像安娜·帕夫洛夫娜所说的那样，在晚会上聚会的，首先有：La　creme　de　la　véritalle　bonne　sociéte，la　fine　fleur　de　l\u0027essence　intellectuelle　de　la　société　de　Pétersbourg．②除开人物的细致挑选而外，安娜·帕夫洛夫娜举办的晚会还有一个特点，那就是安娜·帕夫洛夫娜在每次晚会上都要向她的团体介绍一位挺有趣的新人物，在任何场所都不像在这些晚会上那样，政治寒暑表指示的度数极为明晰和准确，在寒暑表上可以观察到彼得堡正统宫廷社会的情绪。 \n ①法语：他是半个疯子，——我总是这样说的。\n ②法语：真正的上流社会的精华，彼得堡社会知识界的优秀人物。\n ①法语：真正的上流社会的精华。\n ②法语：品格高尚的。\n 在这次晚会上，政治寒暑表向这个团体指示的度数如下：\n 无论欧洲的国王和战略家们怎样想方设法地纵容波拿巴给我，总的说来也就是给·我·们制造麻烦和苦恼，但是我们对波拿巴的看法是不会改变的。我们在这方面不会不说出自己的真正的想法，我们对普鲁士国王及其他国王只能这样说：“那样对你们更糟。Tu　l\u0027as　voulu，George　Dandin①，这就是我们所能说的。”这就是政治寒暑表在安娜·帕夫洛夫娜举办的晚会上所能指示的内容。当被献给客人们的新人物鲍里斯走进客厅的时候，出席晚会的全体人员差不多都来齐了，安娜·帕夫洛夫娜引导的谈话涉及到我国和奥国的外交关系，涉及我国与奥国结盟的展望。\n 鲍里斯穿着一身考究的副官制服，他长得健壮、结实，精神充沛，面颊绯红，轻松愉快地走进客厅，照例先去问候姑母，随后又加入交谈的集体。\n 安娜·帕夫洛夫娜让他吻吻她那只干瘦的手，给他介绍了几个他不认识的人，并且轻言细语地把各人的特征描述一番。\n “Le　prince　Hippolyte　Kouraguine－charmant　jeAune　homme．M－r　Krong　chargé　d\u0027affaires　d　Kopenhague－un　esprit　profond，索兴说：M－r　Shitltoff，un　homme　de　beaucoup　de　mérite．②”即指那位有这个称号的人。 \n ①法语：莫里哀引言，已变成谚语，其含义是：你自作自受。\n ②法语：伊波利特·库拉金公爵是一个可爱的青年，克鲁格先生是哥本哈根驻俄使馆代办，一位才智卓越的人……索兴说：希托夫先生是个品格高尚的人。\n “Vienne　trouve　les　bases　du　trait\u0027\n proposétellement　hors　d\u0027atteinte，qu\u0027on　ne　saurait　y　parvenir　même　par　une　continuite　de　succés　les　plus　brillants，et　elle　mêt　en　doute　les　moyens　qui　pourraient　nous　les　procurev，C\u0027est　la　phrase　authentique　du　cabi－net　de　Vienne，”①丹麦使馆代办说。“C\u0027est　le　doute　qui　est　flatteur！”l\u0027homme　a　l\u0027esprit　profond．”②带着含蓄的微笑说。\n “Il　faut　distinguer　entre　le　cabinet　de　ViAenne　et　l\u0027Empereur　d\u0027Autriche，”莫特马尔说。“L\u0027EmApereur　d\u0027Autrichen\u0027a　jamais　pu　penser　à　une　chose　pareille，ce　n\u0027est　que　le　cabinet　qui　le　dit．③”\n “Eh，mon　cher　vicomte，”安娜·帕夫洛夫娜插嘴了，“l\u0027Urope（她不知怎的竟把欧洲读作l\u0027Urope，这是她跟法国人说话时着重强调的法语发音上的细微特点），l\u0027Urope　ne　sera　jamais　notre　alliée　sincère．④” \n ①法语：维也纳认为正拟缔结的条约的根据仍然超出可能限度，只有凭藉一系列的辉煌成就才能获得这些根据，维也纳对我们是否有取得成就的办法表示怀疑，这是维也纳内阁所说的实话。\n ②法语：“这种怀疑值得赞颂！”才智卓越的人说。\n ③法语：务必要把维也纳内阁和奥国皇帝区别开来，”莫特马尔说。“奥国皇帝”决不会这样想，只有内阁才这样说。”\n ④法语：哎呀，我亲爱的子爵，欧洲决不会成为我们忠实的盟邦。\n 鲍里斯谛听旁人说话，等着轮到他发言，但在这时，他有好几次回头看看邻座的美女海伦，海伦面露笑容，她的目光有几次和年轻貌美的副官的目光相遇。\n 很自然，安娜·帕夫洛夫娜在说到普鲁士的局势时，她请鲍里斯谈谈他在格洛高的旅行、谈谈他发现普鲁士军队处于怎样的状态。鲍里斯不慌不忙，用那纯正的法国话讲了许多关于军队和朝廷中的饶有趣味的详情细节，在他讲话的时候，他想方设法避免对他所摆的事实发表各人自己的见解。有一阵子鲍里斯吸引住了大家的注意力，安娜·帕夫洛夫娜心里也觉得，她以新人物飨客受到全体客人的欢迎。海伦比什么人都更聚精会神地听鲍里斯讲话。她有几次问到他旅行中的详细情形，她似乎非常关心普鲁士军队的局势。当他一把话说完，她就带着平常流露的微笑，把脸向他转过来。\n “Il　faut　absolument　que　vous　veniez　me　voir，”①她对他说道，那语调就好像根据那些他没法知道的想法来推敲，这是完全必要的。“Mardi　entre　les　8　et　9　heures．Vous　me　ferez　grand　plaisir．”② \n ①法语：您一定要来跟我见面。\n ②法语：礼拜二，八点钟至九点钟。您将给我带来极大的愉快。\n “您不是知道她的丈夫吗？”安娜·帕夫洛夫娜闭上眼睛，装出一副忧愁的样子，指着海伦说，“哎呀！这是个多么不幸而又迷人的妇女啊！别当着她的面说她丈夫，您不要说吧。她太难受了。”\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53/3385.html","bookId":585,"book":{"id":585,"title":"War And Peace战争与和平","description":"简介： War and Peace , a Russian novel by Leo Tolstoy, is considered one of the most celebrated works of fiction.It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina (1873–1877), as Tolstoy\u0027s finest literary achievement.Epic in scale, War and Peace deline...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12858150784da3b.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/53","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
