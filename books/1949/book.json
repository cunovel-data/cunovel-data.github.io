I think my husband, Dave, might be having an affair. I found an earring in his pocket, and it\u0027s not mine. I\u0027m also worried because some jewelry was recently stolen from an old woman --- and Dave used to visit her a lot. You see, he\u0027s a pastor. And a good man. I can\u0027t believe he\u0027s guilty of anything, but why won\u0027t he tell me where he\u0027s been when he comes home so late? Reader, I\u0027d love to hear what you think. I also want to tell you what\u0027s going on with your other friends in Cedar Cove. Like Sheriff Troy Davis, to mention one. His long-ago love, Faith Beckwith, just moved here! So come on in and join me for a cup of tea.
