Good luck and call me.”\n He gave me a small smile before the elevator doors closed. I took Julia upstairs to change her diaper. Since I couldn’t stop thinking about the trial, I was pissed that Connor wasn’t talking to me about it. I wanted to be there for him, but since Julia had been born, I hadn’t had time to think about anything else but her, and I was exhausted all the time. I changed Julia’s diaper and carried her downstairs to find my phone. As I grabbed it off the kitchen counter, I dialed Peyton.\n “Hello, bestie. Did you and Connor have amazing sex last night?” she asked.\n “Good morning, Peyton, and yes, we did have amazing sex, but that’s not why I’m calling.”\n “Oh, I thought you’d want to talk about it,” she said with a disappointed tone.\n “Are you busy today?” I asked her.\n “I just have a few errands to run. Why?”\n “Connor is at the courthouse because the trial is starting today, and I really want to be there for him.”\n “Did he ask you to go?”\n “No, and he wouldn’t either. You know how he is. I just wanted to know if you could watch Julia for a few hours?”\n “Of course I’ll watch that beautiful goddaughter of mine!” she squealed.\n “Thank you, Peyton. I appreciate it.”\n “No problem. I’ll be over in about thirty minutes.”\n As I was putting Julia in her bouncy seat, Denny walked into the kitchen. “I’m glad you’re back. I need you to drive me to the courthouse,” I said as I looked at him.\n “Elle, I don’t think that’s a good idea. You shouldn’t go there.”\n “It’s not a matter of if I should or shouldn’t. I want to, and I want to be there for my husband.”\n “I understand that, but I don’t think Connor wants you there.”\n I rolled my eyes. “Don’t you know me by now?”\n “Yes. Just let me know when you’re ready.” He sighed.\n I smiled as I walked over and kissed him on the cheek. “Thank you, Denny.”\n “You know he’ll probably yell at me for doing this,” he said.\n “Don’t worry about it. If he says anything, I’ll take care of him.” I smiled.\n I asked Denny if he could keep an eye on Julia while I went to get ready. As I was putting on my black skirt, Peyton came strolling into the bedroom, holding her.\n “Are you sure you want to do this, Elle?” she asked.\n “Of course I’m sure.”\n “You know that bitch is crazy, and you haven’t seen her since you punched her out.”\n “I know I haven’t and that’s why it’s time.”\n I put on my black heels, handed Peyton the diaper bag, and kissed Julia goodbye. “Everything you need is in here. If you’re going to take her with you on errands, then you’ll need the stroller and it’s in the hallway by the elevator.”\n “Don’t worry, Mom. I’ve got this!” She smiled.\n “Denny, I’m ready to leave,” I said as I grabbed by purse and we stepped onto the elevator.\n Chapter 8\n Connor\n I sat outside the courtroom, waiting for the trial to begin. I hadn’t seen Ashlyn since that day at the gym.\n “Don’t worry, Connor,” Phil said. “She’ll get what she deserves.”\n “Let’s just hope the jury finds her guilty.”\n As we walked into the courtroom and sat down, I looked over and saw Ellery walking towards me. I instantly stood up.\n “Ellery, what are you doing here?” I asked.\n “I wanted to be here for you, Connor.”\n “Baby, I’m sorry, but I don’t want you here. I don’t want you involved in this.”\n “It’s too late for that, Connor. I’m your wife, and whatever you’re involved in, involves me. Now if you don’t want me here, that’s too f**king bad, because I’m here to support you whether you want me to or not. So deal with it, buddy!” she exclaimed through gritted teeth.\n I sighed as I looked at her, shook my head, and sat down. She said hello to Phil and then sat down next to me.\n “Where’s Julia?”\n “Peyton is watching her,” she replied.\n The lawyers walked into the courtroom and took their seats up front. The guard opened the door off to the side and escorted Ashlyn into the room.\n “Remind me to tell her how becoming that orange jumpsuit is on her and those chain accessories are to die for,” Ellery whispered.\n “You are to stay away from her,” I warned.\n Ashlyn looked directly at me as she entered the courtroom, and then looked directly at Ellery. I put my hand on her thigh because I was nervous she was going to get pissed and start something. Ellery could have quite a temper. She put her hand on mine and looked over at me.\n “Relax, Connor.”\n I took in a deep breath as the judge entered the courtroom. Ashlyn’s attorney stood up and asked the judge for a postponement due to her change of plea.\n “Your honor, my client is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity due to the mental distress she was put under by Mr. Connor Black.”\n As I gasped, Ellery turned and looked at me. Her eyes were wide and angry. I couldn’t believe what I’d just heard. My heart started racing.\n “Is this true?” the judge asked as he looked at Ashlyn.\n “Yes, it is, your Honor,” she said as she nodded her head.\n “Fine. The trial is postponed until one week from today,” he said as he got up from his seat and went into his chambers.\n As the guard walked Ashlyn out of the courtroom, she looked over at me and blew me a kiss. When Ellery went to get up, I grabbed her arm.\n “Don’t,” I whispered.\n “Connor, this is bullshit!” she yelled.\n “Yes, it is bullshit. I need to meet with my personal attorney,” I said.\n As we got up from our seats, I grabbed Ellery’s hand and led her out of the courtroom. When we reached the hallway, I pulled her into me and held her tight.\n “Everything’s going to be fine, Elle; I don’t want you worrying about this.”\n “I hope you’re right,” she said.\n I kissed her on the head and called Lou, my personal attorney. When I hung up the phone from him, I walked over to the bench where Ellery was sitting and talking on the phone. When she hung up, she looked at me with sadness in her eyes.\n “Who where you talking to?” I asked.\n “Peyton. I was checking on Julia.”\n “Is everything okay?”\n “Yeah. She wants to keep Julia a little while longer and then when Henry gets home from the hospital, they’ll bring her home. I invited them for dinner. I hope you don’t mind.”\n “Not at all, sweetheart,” I said as I took her hand and softly kissed it. “I think we could use some good friends tonight,” she said.\n I helped her up from the bench and put my arm around her as we walked out of the building. As I opened the door to the limo, Ellery climbed in and, instantly, Denny knew something was wrong. I sat down next to her and shut the door.\n “What happened in there?” Denny asked.\n “Ashlyn changed her plea to not guilty by reason of insanity, and she’s blaming it on mental distress caused by me.”\n “What?!” he exclaimed.\n Ellery’s eyes started to swell with tears as she looked out her window. I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her closer as I buried my face into her neck.\n “I don’t want you upset over this. Things are going to work out,” I said.\n “She’s an evil bitch, Connor, and she’ll go to whatever lengths necessary to destroy you.”\n “Ellery, I’m not going to let that happen.”\n “Yeah, well neither am I,” she said.\n I pulled back and looked at her. “You are to stay away from Ashlyn. Do you understand me?” I said in a firm voice.\n She looked at me with those blue eyes. They had a look in them that I knew all too well; the look of defiance and anger. She tilted her head as her lips formed a small smile.\n “Yes, Connor, I understand you.”\n Chapter 9\n Ellery\n When we arrived home, I went upstairs to change. A few minutes later, Connor came into the bedroom.\n “Are you mad at me?” he asked.\n I turned around and looked at him as I slipped off my skirt. “No. Why would you ask that?”\n “Because you’re not saying anything and you have that look.”\n The fact of the matter was that I was a little upset with him for using a firm tone with me in the limo.\n “Connor, I’m not mad at you. I’m just a little—”\n “A little what?” he asked as he walked over to me and started unbuttoning my blouse.\n “Okay, you need to stop,” I said as I put my hand up and backed away.\n He inched closer to me with a smile on his face as he slipped off my blouse.\n “Why do I need to stop? I thought you loved it when I undressed you.”\n “I do. It’s just you’re distracting me from my thoughts. To be honest with you, I’m pissed that you used that tone with me earlier.”\n “You use that tone with me all the time, and I find it sexy,” he whispered as his hot breath on my neck made me quiver.\n I bit down on my bottom lip and closed my eyes. He knew damn well what he was doing.\n “Connor.”\n “Shh, baby. Just enjoy what I’m doing to you,” he whispered as his hand pushed my thong to the side and he slipped in his finger.\n I gasped as pleasure overtook my body. He stared at me while slowly moving his finger in and out of me as a small smile escaped his lips.\n “You were saying?”\n “Damn you,” I moaned as I unbuttoned his pants and slid them down.\n I wrapped my fingers around his c*ck and stroked him up and down. He threw his head back as a groan came from the back of his throat. He removed his fingers and pushed me against the wall. His mouth crashed into mine as I wrapped my legs around him and he buried himself inside me with force. He moved at a fast pace. Our hearts were racing and our breathing was shallow as he moved in and out of me, bringing me to orgasm.\n “Oh God, Connor,” I yelled as my body shook.\n “You feel so good, baby,” he shouted as I felt his warmth shoot inside me.\n He stood there, my legs still wrapped around his waist, and his hands firmly cupping my ass.\n “Now what was it you were saying?” He smiled.\n I tilted my head back as he slid his tongue across my throat. “We better get ready. Peyton and Henry will be here soon.” Connor pulled out of me, kissed me on the lips, and walked to the bathroom. I pulled a pair of jeans from the drawer and got dressed. As I sat on the edge of the bed, I started to cry. Connor came out of the bathroom and kneeled down in front of me. He took my hands in his.\n “Baby, what’s wrong? Did I hurt you?” he asked in a panic. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-us-forever-3/page-5.html","bookId":1819,"book":{"id":1819,"title":"Forever Us (Forever #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The story of Connor and Ellery Black continues in the last installment of the Forever Black Trilogy, Forever Us. \n You took Connor and Ellery’s journey of love, courage, and strength as Ellery’s illness threatened their future in Forever Black.
