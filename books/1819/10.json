He moaned as he took turns sucking each nipple. Reaching one hand behind me, I softly caressed his balls as his body tightened.\\n\\n “That’s it, baby, I can’t hold it anymore,” he whispered.\\n\\n Suddenly, I felt a warm sensation shoot into my body as I dug my nails into him and released myself all over him.\\n\\n “Damn it, Ellery, you’re making me want to come again.” He smiled.\\n\\n As I buried my face into his neck and tried to catch my breath, he whispered, “You’re f**king amazing.”\\n\\n I looked at him and kissed him on the lips as I put my hands on each side of his face. “Now, I can go about my day.” I smiled.\\n\\n He laughed and shook his head as I got off of him. I stood up and quickly pulled on my clothes. As I walked to the door, I put my hand on the handle, stopped, and turned around.\\n\\n “I’ll bill you for services rendered.” I winked as I walked out the door.\\n\\n Chapter 14\\n\\n When I arrived home after my day with Peyton, I was surprised that Mason and Julia weren’t home from the park yet. As I pulled out my phone, a text message from Mason came through.\\n\\n “Princess and I made a Starbucks run. Be home in five.”\\n\\n “You better have an iced latte in hand when you walk through the door,” I replied.\\n\\n When I walked into the kitchen to grab a bottle of water, I saw Denny on the phone, sitting at the table. He instantly hung up when he saw me.\\n\\n “Hi, Denny. What’s up?” I asked casually.\\n\\n “Not much, Ellery. How was your day with Peyton?”\\n\\n “It was fine,” I replied as I took a bottle of water from the refrigerator.\\n\\n He seemed to be nervous. Almost as if he had just gotten caught doing something or he was afraid that I had heard something while he was on the phone. When I heard the elevator doors open, I ran out of the kitchen and straight to Julia. I smiled as I unbuckled her and held her tight.\\n\\n “One iced latte for you, my dear.” Mason smiled as he handed me the cup.\\n\\n “Thank you, darling. How was Julia today?”\\n\\n “Glamorous and perfect, like always. You should have seen the people at the park going crazy over her.”\\n\\n “That’s because she’s her daddy’s girl.” I smiled as I held her and kissed her cheek.\\n\\n I told Mason that Connor and I would be dropping her off at his place around seven o’clock. He smiled, kissed her goodbye, and stepped onto the elevator. As I was walking up the stairs with Julia, Denny emerged from the kitchen.\\n\\n “Did you work things out with Connor?” he asked.\\n\\n “I sure did.” I winked.\\n\\n He rolled his eyes and smiled as he left the penthouse.\\n\\n I laid Julia down in the center of our king-sized bed as I got ready for my date with Connor. While I was in my closet looking for something to wear, I heard Connor walk into the bedroom. He walked over to the bed and sat down next to Julia. The moment she saw him, her little legs started moving all around.\\n\\n “Look at how excited she is to see her daddy.” He smiled.\\n\\n “I don’t blame her. I get excited when I see her daddy too.”\\n\\n “Elle, don’t say things like that,” he warned with a smile.\\n\\n I walked over to him. Julia had her hand clasped around his finger.\\n\\n “I’m still thinking about our little office romp,” I whispered as I wrapped my arms around him and kissed his cheek.\\n\\n “God, baby, I am too.” He smiled as he turned his head and his lips brushed against mine.\\n\\n “Where are we going tonight?”\\n\\n “Anywhere you want to go,” he said. “I’ve been thinking a lot about something lately, and I want to talk to you about it.”\\n\\n As I pulled my jeans from the drawer, a sick feeling overtook me because I was afraid to hear what he’d been thinking about.\\n\\n “I want to get a tattoo, and I was thinking we could go to the place where you got yours.”\\n\\n My eyes lit up as I turned around and looked at him. “Are you serious? What kind of tattoo do you want?”\\n\\n “I can see that you’re pleasantly surprised by the idea.” He smiled. “I want something with yours and Julia’s names on it, but leave enough room in case we have another child.”\\n\\n While pulling up my jeans, I stopped midway and looked at him. “Another child?”\\n\\n “Yeah, why not? Let’s make us a four-person family.”\\n\\n “We can talk about this again in about two years, Connor. I’m not ready to even think about having another baby yet, especially with the problems I had while I was in labor with Julia.”\\n\\n As I finished pulling up my jeans, he got up from the bed, walked over to me, and put his hands on my hips. “Don’t worry; I don’t want a baby now. I was just thinking in the future,” he said as he kissed me on the head.\\n\\n “How about if we go out to dinner first and then we’ll go see Jack about that tattoo you want to get.”\\n\\n “Sounds good, sweetheart. I’m going to take a quick shower and then we’ll go.”\\n\\n Julia started fussing, so I picked her up from the bed and took her downstairs. As I was warming up a bottle, I heard my phone chime. I picked it up from the counter and saw that I had a text message from Cassidy.\\n\\n “I’m going on a date tonight with Ben! I’m so nervous, Elle.”\\n\\n “That’s great, Cass. Don’t be nervous. You’ll have fun.”\\n\\n “It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date.”\\n\\n “Just relax and be yourself. Call me tomorrow and let me know how it went.”\\n\\n Just as I hit the send button, Connor came walking into the kitchen and took Julia from me.\\n\\n “Let me finish feeding her. I missed her today.”\\n\\n Connor sat down in the chair and couldn’t stop smiling at Julia as he held the bottle in her mouth.\\n\\n “Cassidy just texted me, and she’s going on a date with Ben tonight.”\\n\\n “What? Are you serious?” he growled.\\n\\n “Yes, I’m serious, and what’s your problem? Your sister deserves to be happy.”\\n\\n He sighed. “Don’t get me wrong. I want nothing more than for Cassidy to find the man of her dreams that will come in and sweep her off her feet and make her happy, but I’m afraid she’ll get hurt because of Camden.”\\n\\n “Because of Camden? Why?” I asked.\\n\\n “Because of his autism. It’s going to take a pretty special guy to get involved with my sister under those circumstances. Not a lot of guys want to jump into a relationship like that.”\\n\\n “Maybe Ben is that special guy.” I smiled as I got up from the chair and grabbed the diaper bag.\\n\\n “Doubt it.”\\n\\n I sighed as I looked over at Connor. “Are you still being pissy because I said he was hot?”\\n\\n He wouldn’t look at me and he had a smirk on his face. “You’re lucky you’re holding Julia, because if you weren’t—”\\n\\n “If I weren’t, then what, Ellery?”\\n\\n “Oh, nothing.” I smiled as I walked out of the kitchen and into the living room to get Julia’s blanket.\\n\\n Before I knew it, Connor had followed me. He laid Julia down on her blanket, which was on the floor and looked at me.\\n\\n “If I weren’t ... what?” He smiled as he began moving towards me.\\n\\n I started to back up as I bit down on my bottom lip. Once again, his look, his walk, his whole demeanor—I knew all too well. I ran up the stairs, but before I could make it, Connor grabbed me from behind and carried me back down.\\n\\n “Now, tell me again what you were going to do to me if I wasn’t holding Julia?” he whispered in a sexy voice that sent shivers down my spine.\\n\\n His grip on me was tight, and he wouldn’t let me go. I didn’t want him to let me go. When he held me, I felt safe from the world and all my worries disappeared. He put me down, but continued to hold me from behind. I could tell he didn’t want to let go as he buried his face into my neck. Finally, I broke the silence.\\n\\n “Everything’s going to be okay, baby,” I whispered as I freed my arm and brought my hand to the back of his head.\\n\\n Chapter 15\\n\\n Connor\\n\\n I held onto Ellery, and Julia started to fuss on the floor. I removed her hand from the back of my head and placed her palm against my lips.\\n\\n “Let’s get Julia packed up and ready to go,” I said.\\n\\n As I walked over and picked her up, Ellery got the diaper bag ready. I put Julia in the car seat and we stepped onto the elevator. We dropped Julia off with Mason and Landon and headed out for dinner.\\n\\n “Where do you want to go for dinner?” I asked.\\n\\n “The Shake Shack,” she replied.\\n\\n I looked at her as I twisted my face. “The what, what?”\\n\\n “The Shake Shack, silly! We can get burgers and shakes, plus it’s right by Jack’s Tattoo Parlor.”\\n\\n “It sounds dirty and greasy.”\\n\\n Ellery laughed as she cocked her head at me. “You’re so adorable. Now, let’s go. I’m hungry.”\\n\\n I sighed and we headed to the Shake Shack. As I sat there, eating my grilled chicken sandwich, Ellery shoved her burger in my face.\\n\\n “Here, taste this. It’s the best burger in the world.”\\n\\n “No thanks. It looks greasy and disgusting,” I said.\\n\\n “Suit yourself, Mr. Black. I remember a time when you would taste anything I shoved in your face.”\\n\\n I sat there and stared at her as she ate her burger and fries. I was mesmerized by how adorable she was, eating that burger full of grease. I couldn’t resist her, so I gave in.\\n\\n “Bring it here, and let me taste it,” I said as I held out my hand.\\n\\n A smile spread across her face. The one thing that I loved most about her was that the littlest things made her happy. I took a bite as she held it up to me and was pleasantly surprised that it was good.\\n\\n “Well?” She smiled.\\n\\n “It’s not bad.”\\n\\n “I knew it! I knew you’d like it.”\\n\\n We finished up dinner, if that’s what you wanted to call it, and headed out the door. The tattoo parlor was a couple of blocks over, and Ellery wanted to walk. I took her hand in mine and we headed to the parlor. We were walking down the street and looking in the various shop windows as we passed by, when Ellery suddenly stopped.\\n\\n “Hi, Elle.”\\n\\n “Hi, Kyle,” she replied.\\n\\n “Connor.” He nodded his head.\\n\\n “Kyle.” I nodded back.\\n\\n He introduced us to his girlfriend and asked Ellery how she was doing. She pulled out her phone and showed him pictures of Julia. I was uncomfortable and just wanted to get the hell out of there. I could see by the way he looked at her that he still had feelings for her. We said our goodbyes and continued walking down the street.\\n\\n “That was awkward,” I said.\\n\\n “Not really. I’ve run into him before.”\\n\\n “You have? You’ve never mentioned it.”\\n\\n “It was no big deal. Just a quick ‘hi’ in passing.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-us-forever-3/page-10.html","bookId":1819,"book":{"id":1819,"title":"Forever Us (Forever #3)","description":"Storyline: The story of Connor and Ellery Black continues in the last installment of the Forever Black Trilogy, Forever Us. \\n You took Connor and Ellery’s journey of love, courage, and strength as Ellery’s illness threatened their future in Forever Black.
