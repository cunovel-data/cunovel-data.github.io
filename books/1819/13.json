I was just wondering because you were really adamant about going and then you never mentioned it again. I thought that maybe you’d changed your mind. Actually, I was hoping you’d changed your mind.” “No, Peyton, I haven’t changed my mind.” “Okie dokie, Elle. What are you doing?” “Staring at my sexy husband as he’s standing in the doorway. I’ll call you later.” As I hit the end button, Connor walked over, took Julia, and sat in the rocking chair. My greatest love was watching my husband with his daughter. I took the new clothes I bought for Julia and hung them in the closet. My stomach tied itself in knots when Connor asked me a question. “What haven’t you changed your mind about?” I stood facing the inside of the closet as I hung up the clothes one by one. My skin started to feel fiery and nerves set in. I needed to think of something fast. “What?” I innocently asked. “I heard you say to Peyton that you haven’t changed your mind.” “Oh, that. It was about going with her next week to look at flowers for the wedding.” “Why would she think that you’d change your mind?” “She didn’t. She was just making sure that I didn’t change my mind,” I said as I looked at him in confusion. “Shouldn’t Henry be going with her?” he asked. “Did you go with me, Mr. Black?” “Good point.” He smiled. Emerging from the rocking chair, he took Julia downstairs and put her in her swing. I followed behind as I let out a sigh of relief. If he ever found out that I was going to see Ashlyn, I didn’t know what he’d do. I picked up toys around the living room and put them in a basket, then walked to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. Connor came from behind and wrapped his strong arms around me, taking in my scent as his hot breath traveled down my neck. As I put my hands on his arms and tilted my head to the side, his lips began their journey across my skin. “I wish Mason was here right now to take Julia for a while so I could f**k you on this kitchen counter.” “We don’t need Mason. You can still do it. Julia’s being good in her swing. We may not have a lot of time, but we can certainly try.” A low growl developed in the back of his throat as he reached his hand between my thighs and started cupping me below. I quickly turned around to face him. He picked me up and set me on the counter while his hands made their way up my shirt and to my br**sts. I brought my hands to his head and ran my fingers through his hair. Our mouths devoured each other. Suddenly, we heard someone clear their throat. I jumped, and Connor looked across the kitchen. “Am I interrupting something?” Denny asked as he walked to the refrigerator. “Damn it, Denny.” “Relax, Connor. Julia would have made sure you two didn’t get any further.” I couldn’t help but laugh at his comment as I got off the counter and straightened my shirt. Just as I was about to say something, my phone rang. I looked over to where it was sitting. “It’s a call from Chicago. I bet it’s Sal’s brother. I’ll be right back,” I said as I walked out of the kitchen. “Hello.” “Ellery?” a male voice spoke. “Yes, this is Ellery.” “Hi, this is Vinnie, Sal’s brother. He said he was going to call you about my art gallery showing here in Chicago.” “Yes, Vinnie, Sal did call me, and I’m very interested in doing a showing.” “That’s great, Ellery. I’ve seen your work and I think you’re an amazing painter. Is there any way you can fly out to Chicago and we can meet for dinner to discuss the opening?” “Sure. When would you like to meet?” “The sooner, the better. That way, you can get a feel for what I’m expecting.” “I can probably fly out tomorrow,” I said. “That’ll be great. Call me or send me a text to confirm, and I’ll make reservations for dinner. I look forward to meeting you, Ellery.” “Thank you, Vinnie. I’ll be in touch.” Excitedly, I walked back to the kitchen, where Denny was holding Julia and Connor was sitting across from him. “Well?” Connor asked. “I’m flying to Chicago tomorrow to have dinner with Vinnie. So make sure the plane’s ready.” “Yes, ma’am!” Connor smiled. “I’ll clear my schedule for tomorrow and fly with you.” “You don’t have to go, Connor. I know how busy you are.” “You’re not going alone, end of discussion, Ellery,” he said in a serious tone. I looked over at Denny as he raised his eyebrows at me. When I slowly walked over to where Connor sat, he looked up from his phone at me. “What?” “I love you, but if you ever take that tone with me again, I will hurt you. Do you understand?” The corners of his mouth curved up into a sinister smile. “Then I’ll make sure to use that tone more often, especially in the bedroom.” “Or in the kitchen, if that’s what you prefer,” Denny chimed in. I couldn’t help but laugh as I walked over and kissed Denny on the cheek. After having the best sex with Connor, first in bed and then again in the shower, we packed a light bag, grabbed the diaper bag, put Julia in her car seat, and headed to Mason’s loft to pick him up. Opening the door, he slid into the seat across from us and sat down next to Julia. “Hello, princess! We’re going to have so much fun in Chicago. Uncle Mason is going to take you to the American Girl store.” “Don’t you think she’s a little young for that?” Connor asked. “Bite your tongue! You’re never too young for those beautiful and fun dolls.” Once we arrived at the airport, we boarded Connor’s plane and headed to Chicago. Upon arriving in the Windy City, we checked ourselves into the Trump Towers and headed to our rooms. Connor handed Mason a key to his own room. Mason looked at him in confusion. “I have my own room? Aren’t nannies supposed to stay with the couple and their child?” “You have your own room where you can hang out with Julia when we need you to. Your bar is fully stocked with the best liquor, so please enjoy. But not while Julia’s with you.” “Have I told you how much I love you?” Mason winked at him. Stepping into the suite, I threw myself on the luxurious king-sized bed. Connor asked Mason to take Julia to his room while we got ready for dinner. “Dinner isn’t for a few hours,” I said. Connor walked towards the bed, unbuttoning his shirt. He slid it off and laid it across the chair. I stared at his sexy, ripped abs and shivers ran across my skin. He climbed on the bed and hovered over me while he gazed into my eyes. “I want to make love to you, Ellery Black; right here and right now. I want to touch and feel every inch of your bare skin, and I want to feel your excitement all over me. Then I want to take you into the bathtub and soap up your nak*d body while making love to you again.” I gasped. His effect on me was riveting, and I was already wet just from his words. He always made me feel like I was the only woman on Earth, and his constant hunger for me made my body tremble. I stared into his mesmerizing eyes as he slid his hand down my yoga pants, not stopping until he felt how aroused I was. “God, you’re so wet, baby,” he moaned as dipped his finger inside me. I arched my back and threw back my head, begging for more as he ripped off my pants and tossed them on the floor. While I freshened up my makeup and fixed my hair, Connor went and brought Julia and Mason back to the room. Mason walked into the bathroom and looked at me. “Look at your glowing face, Miss Ellery. You must’ve had amazing sex.” I didn’t turn around. I looked at him through the mirror and smiled. “I knew it!” he exclaimed. “Oh, stop it. You knew we were going to when he had you take Julia to your room.” Mason took a few steps forward and leaned in closer to me. “Just tell me one thing: is he as amazing in bed as he looks like he’d be?” I knitted my eyebrows at him and then smiled. “Yes, and amazing doesn’t even describe how skillful he is.” “Damn, I knew it.” He sighed. “Stop dreaming about my husband and help me pick out a dress to wear.” As I walked over to the closet and looked at the four dresses I brought, Connor walked into the bedroom with Julia. He laid her down on the bed and dangled her animal keys in front of her. I looked over and smiled, then pulled the red dress and the blue dress from the closet. “Which one?” I asked as I held both dresses up. “The blue one. The red one,” both Connor and Mason said at the same time. I looked at both of them with a twisted face. “Okay, the black one it is,” I said as I put the red and blue dresses back, and I pulled out the black one. “Thank you, gentlemen. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a dress to put on.” “Okay, black works,” I heard Mason say as I walked into the bathroom and shut the door. When I finished putting on my dress and black heels, I kissed Julia goodbye while Connor had his hand on the small of my back, pushing me out the door. We met Vinnie at a restaurant called Spiaggia. He had already arrived and stood up when the hostess showed us to the table. “Ellery Black. It’s nice to finally meet you,” he said as he kissed me lightly on the cheek. “It’s nice to meet you as well, Vinnie. This is my husband, Connor Black.” The two of them shook hands, then we took our seats and opened our menus. “I took the liberty of ordering us a bottle of their finest Pinot grigio. I hope you don’t mind.” “No, not at all.” Connor smiled. After deciding what I wanted for dinner, I closed the menu and folded my hands on the table. “So, tell me about your art gallery.” “The gallery is about ten thousand square feet. I would like to show you it tomorrow morning, if possible.” “We need to fly back to New York in the morning. How about tonight, after dinner?” Connor said. “Okay, tonight will be fine.” Vinnie smiled. “The opening of the gallery will take place in forty-five days,” Vinnie said. “Is that something you can work with?” I took a sip of my wine and swallowed hard. I didn’t know if I could do it. But I wasn’t going to let him know that. “Of course I can work with that,” I said as I took another sip of wine. “Great. When we go and tour the unfinished gallery, I’ll show you the space I have picked out for your paintings.” As we ate our fine cuisine and drank our wine, Connor and Vinnie mostly talked about the business aspect of the art gallery. I pulled out my phone and sent a text message to Mason.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-us-forever-3/page-13.html","bookId":1819,"book":{"id":1819,"title":"Forever Us (Forever #3)","description":"Storyline: The story of Connor and Ellery Black continues in the last installment of the Forever Black Trilogy, Forever Us.
