I’m just admiring your beauty before we part ways in a couple of hours.” I spit in the sink and rinsed my mouth before walking over to him and placing my hands on his bare and sculpted chest. “I hate the fact that we aren’t going to see each other until tomorrow.” “I know. Me too,” he said as he held my face and kissed my lips. “So, what are your plans?” I asked casually. “I’m not telling you a thing. You’re so secretive about your party, so I’m being secretive too.” “You do realize you sound like a baby, right?” “Yes, but only your baby,” he whispered as he licked behind my ear and then slapped me on the ass. I giggled as I packed the last of the things I needed for the party. When Connor was done showering and getting dressed, he grabbed my bag and we took the elevator down to the parking garage, where two limos were waiting for us. “Your limo, my love,” Connor said as he opened the door. “Thank you, darling.” I smiled. He wrapped his arms around me and pulled me into him. “Be careful, behave, and be safe.” “Don’t worry, Connor, I’ll be fine. You do the same.” “I love you, Ellery.” “I love you, Connor,” I said as I got in the limo and we pulled away. We picked up Mason and Landon, since they lived around the corner, and then we picked up Peyton and the other girls in the wedding party. Peyton was wound up and ready to get the party started. She didn’t have any idea of what I had planned. In fact, nobody did, not even Mason. “Okay, bestie, tell me what’s on the agenda for today and tonight and why we had to pack an overnight bag!” “You’ll see when we get there.” I smiled. The limo pulled up to the curb of the Waldorf Hotel and all eyes grew wide. “Elle, what did you do?” Mason asked. I smiled as the driver opened the door and we all stepped out of the limo. “Our day starts here,” I said. As we walked through the doors of the hotel, we were instantly greeted by the concierge. “Mrs. Black, welcome to the Waldorf.” “Thank you,” I said as the bellhop took our bags and led us to the elevator. When we reached the Presidential Suite, I put the card key in the slot and opened the door. “Look at this f**king place!” Peyton squealed. “I think I’ve died and gone to Heaven,” Mason said as he looked around the suite. “I have hairstylists and makeup artists for each of us coming in to do our hair and make up for tonight.” I smiled. “Shut the f**k up!” Peyton screamed as she threw her arms around me. I grabbed my phone from my purse and looked at the time. “Okay, everyone, we have spa appointments in five minutes. We’re all getting the works. Massage, facial, manicures, and pedicures.” As we walked out of the suite, Mason looped his arm around me. “You sure know how to do it up, girl!” He smiled. We all changed into our luxurious robes and slippers from the spa. I realized that I had left my phone in the suite, and I needed to keep it on me in case there was an emergency with Julia. “I’ll be right back. I left my phone in the room,” I said as I got up and walked out of the spa. While I stood and waited for the elevator, I couldn’t stop thinking about Connor and how I already was starting to miss him. I was beginning to regret not telling him my plans, but I knew he wouldn’t approve of the nightlife with his safety issues and all. When the elevator doors opened, I gasped and I stood there, unable to move. The man inside of the elevator looked at me. I looked at him. As I swallowed hard, my heart began beating rapidly from the way he was staring at me. His mysterious eyes studied me as they looked me up and down. “Which floor, miss?” he asked. “Thirty-fifth, please.” “Spa?” he asked as he stared at the robe I was wearing. “Yes, I’m throwing a bachelorette party for my best friend,” I answered as I bit down on my bottom lip. The elevator stopped at the thirty-fifth floor and we both stepped out. “Have a good time at the bachelorette party. Hopefully, I’ll run into you again.” He smiled as I turned right and he turned left. I smiled and nodded my head as I thanked him and walked to my room. I took the key from the pocket of my robe and, as I slid it in, I turned my head and looked in the direction he went, only to find him six rooms down, staring at me. As I opened the door, I quickly stepped inside the room and shut it. Backing up against the door, I let out deep breaths as my heart pounded rapidly in my chest. What the hell is wrong with me? I walked over to where my phone sat on the table and checked it. There weren’t any messages from my in-laws or Connor. As I lay on the massage table, I couldn’t stop thinking about the elevator, the man in it, and the way he looked at me. My heart began to rapidly pick up pace just from the thought. My mind needed to snap back into reality if I was going to pull this party off. After all of us were finished with our spa appointments, we went back to the room and Peyton screamed when she walked in and saw two hot, buff men wearing nothing but little aprons, cuffs and bow ties. “Oh my God, Ellery! I f**king love you!” As I laughed at her reaction, Landon walked over to me. “Nice touch, Ellery.” He smiled. The buff butlers opened a bottle of champagne and handed each of us a glass. It wasn’t too long after that the stylists arrived. I pulled out a rhinestone studded, silver tiara that said “Bride to be” and handed it to Peyton’s hairstylist. While we were getting ready for our big night out, room service was delivered. The butler answered the door as the trays of sushi, and cheese, and crackers were delivered to the room. Taking the card from the tray, the buff butler handed it to me. It read: “A little gift for you and your girls. I hope you enjoy it. Regards, the man from the elevator.” “Who’s it from?” Peyton asked. “It’s just from the hotel staff,” I lied. “Butlers in the buff, bring those trays over here!” she said. I smiled as I read the note and, once again, my heart started racing at the thought of him. The mystery of him got under my skin. I couldn’t believe he sent the trays and that he was thinking about me. “Hello, Elle! What world are you lost in?” Peyton said as she snapped her fingers. I looked at her in confusion. “What?” “You looked like you were stuck in space or something. What’s going on with you?” “Nothing. I was just thinking about Julia,” I replied as I sipped my champagne. Once my hair and makeup were done, I stepped into my bedroom and took out the dress I had bought. As I slipped it on, I looked in the mirror. The low cut, short silvery beaded dress was perfect for tonight. “Look at you, hot and sexy mama!” Mason said as he walked into the room. “That dress is hot and your up-do hairstyle really complements it. I don’t think Connor would approve of you looking like that without him by your side.” “Connor’s not here, is he?” I smiled. “No, he’s not, but you better be careful because you’re going to have all the guys drooling on the floor.” I laughed as I put on my silver, high-heeled, Jimmy Choos. Everyone looked amazing. Before leaving the suite, I took out the white sash that was embellished with the words “Bride to be” on it and put it on Peyton. “There! Now your outfit’s complete.” I smiled. Peyton hugged me and there was a knock at the door. As I opened it, the bellhop handed me a piece of white paper. I opened it and it read: “I’m sitting at the bar in the hotel. If you can join me, even for a few minutes, I’d appreciate it. Regards, the man from the elevator.” My rapidly beating pulse was about to give away my nervousness as I turned to the group and told them I’d be right back, that the concierge needed to see me downstairs. As I grabbed my small clutch, I told them I’d meet them in the limo in about twenty minutes. I took the elevator down to the lobby and walked to the bar. As I saw him sitting on the bar stool, the nervous butterflies in my stomach were fluttering their wings like crazy. Why was I doing this? How could I do this? He turned his head and his eyes burned through me. I nervously walked over and sat down on the stool next to him. “I wasn’t sure if you’d show,” he said as he picked up his glass. “I wanted to thank you for the sushi and cheese trays you sent to my room. That was very nice of you, but you didn’t have to do that.” “I know I didn’t, but I thought you and your female companions would enjoy it. Did you enjoy it?” he asked as he stared into my eyes. “Yes, very much. Thank you,” I replied as my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest.” “Would you like a drink?” “No, thank you. I have to meet my friends in the limo in about ten minutes.” “Would you object if I told you how stunning you look?” “Thank you,” I said as I looked down. “I see you’re married,” he said as he looked at my ring. “Yes, I am, and I have a baby at home.” I glanced over at his hand to see if he was wearing a ring and he was. “I see you’re married as well.” He looked at me as the corners of his mouth curved slightly upwards. “Yes, I am. But that doesn’t stop me from looking at beautiful women. Apparently, it doesn’t stop you either because you’re sitting here with me.” I gulped as I got up from the stool. He reached over and placed his hand on mine as an electrical shock shot through my body. “Thank you for coming down and meeting me.” “I have to go. Thank you again for the trays,” I said as I walked out of there as fast as I could. Everyone was waiting for me in the limo. As the driver opened the door for me, I slid in next to Mason. “Are you all right? You look flushed,” he said. “I’m fine. Now let’s go and have a good time.” Chapter 26 We arrived at the first club and had dinner up on the rooftop. I couldn’t stop thinking about the man from the elevator and how it had felt when he touched me. Needing to see if I had any missed calls or text messages, I pulled my phone from my clutch and saw nothing. I wondered what Connor was doing and I felt like I needed to text him. “Hi, babe. I just want to make sure you’re having a good time.” A few minutes later, a reply from him came through. “Hey, baby. We’re having a great time. How about you?” “Yeah, I am. I just wanted to tell you that I love you,” I typed with guilt. “I love you too. Remember to stay safe.” “I will.” As I put my phone back in my clutch, I grabbed my glass of wine and drank it as fast as I could. I put all thoughts of the man from the elevator out of my mind so I could enjoy the evening that I had spent months planning. We ate, drank, and had a good time. But the fun didn’t really start until we walked into the club called X. It was a high-class strip club that was divided in half. One side of the club was male strippers and the other half was female strippers.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-us-forever-3/page-20.html","bookId":1819,"book":{"id":1819,"title":"Forever Us (Forever #3)","description":"Storyline: The story of Connor and Ellery Black continues in the last installment of the Forever Black Trilogy, Forever Us.
