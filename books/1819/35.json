I broke our embrace and looked at my beautiful wife. “Have I told you today how absolutely gorgeous you look?” I smiled. “You have, but I won’t complain if you want to tell me again.” I put my hands on her h*ps and leaned in closer as my lips brushed against her exposed neck. “You’re stunning and elegant, and I want to do very bad things with you,” I whispered. Ellery gasped as she tilted her head and allowed me better access. “As much as I want you to do bad things to me, we have to leave now; the limos are waiting for us.” I looked at my watch and saw that she was right. It was time to get our little bride to her groom. The wedding was taking place in the Conservatory Gardens in Central Park; the exact same spot where Ellery and I got married. No expense was spared for this wedding. It had become the event of the year. We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect day. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and the sun was shining brightly. As we pulled up to the Vanderbilt Gates, Ellery kissed me on the cheek and told me she’d see me in a while. I looked out the window at the guests that were already seated and waiting for the ceremony to start. “Are you ready, sweetheart?” I asked Julia as she sat across from me. “Yeah, Dad, I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.” She smiled. The driver opened the door. I stepped out of the limo and held out my hand, helping Julia from her seat. I led her to the entrance of the gates, and we stood on the edge of the white runner. “You better not cry,” Julia said as she looked at me. “You better not cry.” I smiled. “Mom’s going to cry, you know.” “I know she will. She was trying to be strong earlier, but when she sees you walking down the aisle, she’ll break down.” “I caught her crying this morning, but she doesn’t know that I saw her, so please don’t tell her.” The band started to play the “Wedding March” and that was our cue to start walking down the aisle. “Here we go. Are you sure you want to go through with this?” I asked. “Daddy, stop it. Of course I want to.” With Julia’s arm wrapped around mine, I walked my baby girl down the aisle. Jake was grinning from ear to ear. As I looked over at Ellery, I saw a tear fall from her eye. When we reached the end of the aisle, I placed Julia’s hand in Jake’s, kissed her on the cheek, and then wiped the single tear that fell from her eye. I took my seat next to Ellery and held her hand. She was trying so hard to hold back the rest of the tears that wanted to fall. I leaned in closer to her and whispered, “Remember your makeup. We have pictures to take after the ceremony.” She nodded her head as we sat there and watched our daughter get married. The reception was held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel; the same place where Ellery and I had our reception. We arrived before Julia, Jake, and the wedding party did. Peyton and Henry walked in a few moments after us. “Elle, the ceremony was amazing!” Peyton said. “Wasn’t it? Just think, in a couple of years, we could be doing this again with Collin and Hailey.” I looked at Henry and put my hand on his shoulder. “Good, then it’ll be your turn to pay for a wedding like this.” Henry laughed before walking over to the bar to get a drink. I walked over to the table where Denny and Dana were sitting. Both of them were having some health issues, but they wouldn’t miss Julia’s wedding for anything. Ellery was talking to Cassidy when I walked over and told her that Julia and Jake had arrived. The band introduced the newly married couple and then each person in the bridal party. After an exceptional dinner, it was time for the bridal dance. Jake took Julia’s hand and led her to the dance floor. You could see how much he loved her and adored her. He reminded me of myself. We had been down a bit of a rough road with Julia and a couple of her boyfriends, and Ellery and I were so thankful when she’d met Jake. Ellery stood in front of me, and I wrapped my arms around her as we watched our daughter and son in-law share their first dance as husband and wife. “Remember our bridal dance?” Ellery asked. “I sure do. How could I forget? I picked our perfect song.” “I know, and it was perfect. Julia and Jake remind me of us.” Their song had ended, and the song for the bridal party came on. As soon as they introduced Collin and Hailey, everyone cheered. “Do you think they’ll get married?” I asked Ellery. “Yes. I know he loves her very much, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he buys her a ring for her birthday in a few months.” “Poor kids. They don’t stand a chance with you and Peyton involved.” Ellery laughed and reached behind me and smacked my ass. “You better watch it, baby. You’re getting me hard,” I said. The band had called my name and asked me to step out onto the dance floor, as it was time for our father-daughter dance. I smiled as I walked to Julia and took her hand. The song had started and I began to get a little emotional. “How are you, Mrs. Jensen?” I asked her. “I’m great, Dad. How are you?” “I’m okay.” I smiled. “I know I’ve told you this a thousand times, but thank you again for the honeymoon.” She smiled. “You’re welcome, honey. Did I mention that your mom and I are going too?” “Dad!” Julia giggled. “Enjoy yourself, but prepare to work extra hard at the office when you get back.” I winked. “Your dance with Mom is next.” “You didn’t tell her I picked out the song, did you?” “No. I want her to be surprised. It’s such a beautiful song, Dad. You’re such a romantic.” Our song had ended, and I hugged Julia before taking the hand of my beautiful wife as she stepped out onto the dance floor. “I would like to introduce to you, the bride’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Connor Black, dancing to ‘Close Your Eyes,’ handpicked by Mr. Black and dedicated to Mrs. Black,” the singer of the band said. Ellery placed her hand in mine and tears started to form in her eyes as she heard the song that was being sung for her. “I want you to listen to every word, because this song is exactly how I feel about you. You’re the love of my life, the light of my world, and my savior. You’ll be those things to me forever,” I said as I kissed her lips. “Don’t cry. You’ll ruin your mascara, and we have one more picture to take.” “I love you, Connor. Even after all these years, you still make my heart race, and you make me incredibly wet.” Ellery smiled as she whispered in my ear. When she said that, I couldn’t help but let out a soft moan. “You wait until I get you up to the room later, Mrs. Black. Be prepared to be up all night.” “I’m counting on it, Mr. Black.” She grinned from ear to ear. Our dance had ended, and the night went on perfectly. It was time for Julia and Jake to leave because my plane was waiting to take them to Europe for their honeymoon. As we stood outside the Waldorf Astoria, Ellery, Julia, Collin, and me stood together for one last picture before Julia and Jake climbed into the limo and waved goodbye. The next day, Ellery and I drove to the beach house. I stood at the edge of the shoreline, looking out at the beautiful ocean water and reflected on my life. I’d been nothing but a broken man, and Ellery was nothing but a girl with an illness. Love found and saved both of us and we raised a beautiful family because of it. As I was in deep thought, Ellery walked up and put her arm around me. “What are you doing out here?” she asked. “I was just thinking about our life together and how proud I am of us and our children.” She smiled as she placed her hand on my chest. “We’ve been through a lot over the years, but we made it, and we’ll continue to make it. Do you know why?” she asked. “Why?” Because infinity is forever, and that’s what you are to me. You’re my infinity, Mr. Black.” I turned to her and smiled as I traced her lips with my finger before brushing mine against them. “Forever us, baby. It’ll always be forever us.” The End","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-us-forever-3/page-35.html","bookId":1819,"book":{"id":1819,"title":"Forever Us (Forever #3)","description":"Storyline: The story of Connor and Ellery Black continues in the last installment of the Forever Black Trilogy, Forever Us.
