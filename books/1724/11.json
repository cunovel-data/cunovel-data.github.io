What did you see?\"\\n\\n Gillbret grew impatient. \"It wasn\u0027t exactly what I saw at all. They didn\u0027t conduct me on any tours, or anything like that.\" He forced himself to relax. \"Well, look, this is what happened. By the time they got me off the ship, I was in more or less of a bad state. I had been too frightened to eat much-it\u0027s a terrible thing, being marooned in space -and I must have looked worse than I really was.\\n\\n \"I identified myself, more or less, and they took me underground. With the ship, of course. I suppose they were more interested in the ship than in myself. It gave them a chance to study Tyrannian spatio-engineering. They took me to what must have been a hospital.\"\\n\\n \"But what did you see, Uncle?\" asked Artemisia.\\n\\n Biron interrupted, \"Hasn\u0027t he ever told you this before?\"\\n\\n Artemisia said, \"No.\"\\n\\n And Gillbret added, \"I\u0027ve never told anyone till now. I was taken to a hospital, as I said. I passed research laboratories in that hospital that must have been better than anything we have on Rhodia. On the way to the hospital I passed factories in which some sort of metalwork was going on. The ships that had captured me were certainly like none I\u0027ve ever heard about.\\n\\n \"It was all so apparent to me at the time that I have never questioned it in the years since. I think of it as my \u0027rebellion world,\u0027 and I know that someday swarms of ships will leave it to attack the Tyranni, and that the subject worlds will be called upon to rally round the rebel leaders. From year to year I\u0027ve waited for it to happen. Each new year I\u0027ve thought to myself: This may be the one. And, each time, I half hoped it wouldn\u0027t be, because I was longing to get away first, to join them so that I might be part of the great attack. I didn\u0027t want them to start without me.\"\\n\\n He laughed shakily. \"I suppose it would have amused most people to know what was going on in my mind. In my mind. Nobody thought much of me, you know.\"\\n\\n Biron said, \"All this happened over twenty years ago, and they haven\u0027t attacked? There\u0027s been no sign of them? No strange ships have been reported? No incidents? And you still think-\"\\n\\n Gillbret fired at him, \"Yes, I do. Twenty years isn\u0027t too long to organize a rebellion against a planet that rules fifty systems. I was there just at the beginning of the rebellion. I know that too. Slowly, since then, they must have been honeycombing the planet with their underground preparations, developing newer ships and weapons, training more men, organizing the attack.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s only in the video thrillers that men spring to arms at a moment\u0027s notice; that a new weapon is needed one day, invented the next, mass-produced the third, and used the fourth. These things take time, Biron, and the men of the rebellion world must know they will have to be completely ready before beginning. They won\u0027t be able to strike twice.\\n\\n \"And what do you call \u0027incidents\u0027? Tyrannian ships have disappeared and never been found. Space is big, you might say, and they might simply be lost, but what if they were captured by the rebels? There was the case of the Tireless two years back. It reported a strange object close enough to stimulate the massometer, and then was never heard from again. It could have been a meteor, I suppose, but was it?\\n\\n \"The search lasted months. They never found it. I think the rebels have it. The Tireless was a new ship, an experimental model. It would be just what they would want.\"\\n\\n Biron said, \"Once having landed there, why didn\u0027t you stay?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you suppose I wanted to? I had no chance. I listened to them when they thought I was unconscious, and I learned a bit more then. They were just starting, out there, at that time. They couldn\u0027t afford to be found out then. They knew I was Gillbret oth Hinriad. There was enough identification on the ship, even if I hadn\u0027t told them myself, which I had. They knew that if I didn\u0027t return to Rhodia there would be a full-scale search that would not readily come to a halt.\\n\\n \"They couldn\u0027t risk such a search, so they had to see to it that I was returned to Rhodia. And that\u0027s where they took me.\"\\n\\n \"What!\" cried Biron. \"But that must have been an even greater risk. How did they do that?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Gillbret passed his thin fingers through his graying hair, and his eyes seemed to be probing uselessly into the backward stretches of his memory. \"They anesthetized me, I suppose. That part all blanks out. Past a certain point there is nothing. I can only remember that I opened my eyes and was back in the Bloodsucker; I was in space, just off Rhodia.\"\\n\\n \"The two dead crewmen were still attached by the tow magnets? They hadn\u0027t been removed on the rebellion world?\" asked Biron.\\n\\n \"They were still there.\"\\n\\n \"Was there any evidence at all to indicate that you had been on the rebellion world?\"\\n\\n \"None; except for what I remembered.\"\\n\\n \"How did you know you were off Rhodia?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t. I knew I was near a planet; the massometer said so. I used the radio again, and this time it was Rhodian ships that came for me. I told my story to the Tyrannian Commissioner of that day, with appropriate modifications. I made no mention of the rebellion world, of course. And I said the meteor had hit just after the last Jump. I didn\u0027t want them to think I knew that a Tyrannian ship could make the Jumps automatically.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think the rebellion world found out that little fact? Did you tell them?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t tell them. I had no chance. I wasn\u0027t there long enough. Conscious, that is. But I don\u0027t know how long I was unconscious and what they managed to find out for themselves.\"\\n\\n Biron stared at the visiplate. Judging from the rigidity of the picture it presented, the ship they were on might have been nailed in space. The Remorseless was traveling at the rate of ten thousand miles an hour, but what was that to the immense distances of space. The stars were hard, bright, and motionless. They had a hypnotic quality about them.\\n\\n He said, \"Then where are we going? I take it you still don\u0027t know where the rebellion world is?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t. But I have an idea who would. I am almost sure I know.\" Gillbret was eager about it.\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"The Autarch of Lingane.\"\\n\\n \"Lingane?\" Biron frowned. He had heard the name some time back, it seemed to him, but he had forgotten the connection. \"Why he?\"\\n\\n \"Lingane was the last Kingdom captured by the Tyranni. It is not, shall we say, as pacified as the rest. Doesn\u0027t that make sense?\"\\n\\n \"As far as it goes. But how far is that?\"\\n\\n \"If you want another reason, there is your father.\"\\n\\n \"My father?\" For a moment Biron forgot that his father was dead. He saw him standing before his mind\u0027s eye, large and alive, but then he remembered and there was that same cold wrench inside him. \"How does my father come into this?\"\\n\\n \"He was at court six months ago. I gained certain notions as to what he wanted. Some of his talks with my cousin, Hinrik, I overheard.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Uncle,\" said Artemisia impatiently.\\n\\n \"My dear?\"\\n\\n \"You had no right to eavesdrop on Father\u0027s private discussions.\"\\n\\n Gillbret shrugged. \"Of course not, but it was amusing, and useful as well. \"\\n\\n Biron interrupted, \"Now, wait. You say it was six months ago that my father was at Rhodia?\" He felt excitement mount.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me. While there, did he have access to the Director\u0027s collection of Primitivism? You told me once that the Director had a large library of matters concerning Earth. \"\\n\\n \"I imagine so. The library is quite famous and it is usually made available to distinguished visitors, if they\u0027re interested. They usually aren\u0027t, but your father was. Yes, I remember that very well. He spent nearly a day there.\"\\n\\n That checked. It had been half a year ago that his father had first asked his help. Biron said, \"You yourself know the library well, I imagine.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"Is there anything in the library that would suggest that there. exists a document on Earth of great military value?\"\\n\\n Gillbret was blank of face and, obviously, blank of mind.\\n\\n Biron said, \"Somewhere in the last centuries of prehistoric\\n\\n Earth there must have been such a document. I can only tell you that my father thought it to be the most valuable single item in the Galaxy, and the deadliest. I was to have gotten it for him, but I left Earth too soon, and in any case\"-his voice faltered-\"he died too soon.\"\\n\\n But Gillbret was still blank. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand. My father mentioned it to me first six months ago. He must have learned of it in the library on Rhodia. If you\u0027ve been through it yourself, can\u0027t you tell me what it was he must have learned?\"\\n\\n But Gillbret could only shake his head.\\n\\n Biron said, \"Well, continue with your story.\"\\n\\n Gillbret said, \"They spoke of the Autarch of Lingane, your father and my cousin. Despite your father\u0027s cautious phraseology, Biron, it was obvious that the Autarch was the fount and head of the conspiracy.\\n\\n \"And then\"-he hesitated-\"there was a mission from Lingane and the Autarch himself was at its head. I-I told him of the rebellion world.\"\\n\\n \"You said a while ago you told nobody,\" said Biron.\\n\\n \"Except the Autarch. I had to know the truth.\"\\n\\n \"What did he tell you?\"\\n\\n \"Practically nothing. But then, he had to be cautious too. Could he trust me? I might have been working for the Tyranni. How could he know? But he didn\u0027t close the door altogether. It\u0027s our only lead.\"\\n\\n \"Is it?\" Biron said. \"Then we\u0027ll go to Lingane. One place, I suppose, is like another.\"\\n\\n Mention of his father had depressed him, and, for the moment, nothing mattered much. Let it be Lingane.\\n\\n Let it be Lingane! That was easy to say. But how does one go about pointing the ship. at a tiny speck of light thirty-five light-years away. Two hundred trillion miles. A two with fourteen zeros after it. At ten thousand miles an hour (current cruising speed of the Remorseless) it would take well over two million years to get there.\\n\\n Biron leafed through the Standard Galactic Ephemeris with something like despair. Tens of thousands of stars were listed in detail, with their positions crammed into three iigures. There were hundreds of pages of these figures, symbolized by the Greek letters? (rho),? (theta), and f (phi). ? was the distance from the Galactic Center in parsecs;?, the angular separation, along the plane of the Galactic Lens from the Standard Galactic Baseline (the line, that is, which connects the Galactic Center and the sun of the planet, Earth); f the angular separation from the Baseline in the plane perpendicular to that of the Galactic Lens, the two latter measurements being expressed in radians. Given those three figures, one could locate any star accurately in all the vast immensity of space.\\n\\n That is, on a given date. In addition to the star\u0027s position on the standard day for which all the data were calculated, one had to know the star\u0027s proper motion, both speed and direction. It was a small correction. comparatively, but necessary. A million miles is virtually nothing compared with stellar distances, but it is a long way with a ship.\\n\\n There was, of course, the question of the ship\u0027s own position. One could calculate the distance from Rhodia by the reading of the massometer, or, more correctly, the distance from Rhodia\u0027s sun, since this far out in space the sun\u0027s gravitational field drowned out that of any of its planets. The direction they were traveling with reference to the Galactic Baseline was more difficult to determine. Biron had to locate two known stars other than Rhodia\u0027s sun. From their apparent positions and the known distance from Rhodia\u0027s sun, he could plot their actual position.\\n\\n It was roughly done but, he felt sure, accurately enough. Knowing his own position and that of Lingane\u0027s sun, he had only to adjust the controls for the proper direction and strength of the hyperatornic thrust.\\n\\n Biron felt lonely and tense. Not frightened! He rejected the word. But tense, definitely. He was deliberately calculating the elements of the Jump for a time six hours later. He wanted plenty of time to check his figures. And perhaps there might be the chance for a nap. He had dragged the bed makings out of the cabin and it was ready for him now.\\n\\n The other two were, presumably, sleeping in the cabin. He told himself that that was a good thing and that he wanted nobody around bothering him, yet when he heard the small sound of bare feet outside, he looked up with a certain eagerness.\\n\\n \"Hello,\" he said, \"why aren\u0027t you sleeping?\"\\n\\n Artemisia stood in the doorway, hesitating. She said, in a small voice, \"Do you mind if I come in? Will I be bothering you?\"\\n\\n \"It depends on what you do.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try to do the right things.\"\\n\\n She seemed too humble, Biron thought suspiciously, and then the reason for it came out.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m awfully frightened,\" she said. \"Aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n He wanted to say no, not at all, but it didn\u0027t come out that way. He smiled sheepishly, and said, \"Sort of.\"\\n\\n Oddly enough, that comforted her. She knelt down on the floor beside him and looked at the thick volumes opened before him and at the sheets of calculations.\\n\\n \"They had all these books here?\"\\n\\n \"You bet. They couldn\u0027t pilot a ship without them.\"\\n\\n \"And you understand all that?\"\\n\\n \"Not all that. I wish I did. I hope I understand enough. We\u0027ll have to Jump to Lingane, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Is that hard to do?\"\\n\\n \"No, not if you know the figures, which are all here, and have the controls, which are all there, and if you have experience, which I haven\u0027t. For instance, it should be done in several Jumps, but I\u0027m going to try it in one because there\u0027ll be less chance of trouble, even though it means a wasteful use of energy.\"\\n\\n He shouldn\u0027t tell her; there was no point ill telling her; it would be cowardly to frighten her; and she\u0027d be hard to handle if she got really frightened, panicky frightened. He kept telling himself all that and it did no good. He wanted to share it with somebody. He wanted part of it off his own mind.\\n\\n He said, \"There are some things I should know that I don\u0027t. Things like the mass density between here and Lingane affect the course of the Jump, because that mass density is what controls the curvature of this part of the universe. The Ephemeris-that\u0027s this big book here-mentions the curvature corrections that must be made in certain standard Jumps, and from those you\u0027re supposed to be able to calculate your own particular corrections. But then if you happen to have a super giant within ten light-years, all bets are off. I\u0027m not even sure if I used the computer correctly.\"\\n\\n \"But what would happen if you were wrong?\"\\n\\n \"We could re-enter space too close to Lingane\u0027s sun.\"\\n\\n She considered that, then said, \"You have no idea how much better I feel.\"\\n\\n \"After what I\u0027ve just said?\"\\n\\n \"Of course. In my bunk I simply felt helpless and lost with so much emptiness in all directions. Now I know that we\u0027re going somewhere and that the emptiness is under our control.\"\\n\\n Biron was pleased. How different she was. \"I don\u0027t know about it\u0027s being under our control.\"\\n\\n She stopped him. \"It is. I know you can handle the ship.\"\\n\\n And Biron decided that maybe he could at that.\\n\\n Artemisia had tucked her long unclad legs under her and sat facing him. She had only her filmy underclothes for cover, but seemed unconscious of the fact, though Biron was definitely not.\\n\\n She said, \"You know, I had an awfully queer sensation in the bunk, almost as I were floating. That was one of the things that frightened me. Every time I\u0027d turn, I\u0027d give a queer little jump into the air and then flop back slowly as if there were springs in the air holding me back.\"\\n\\n \"You weren\u0027t sleeping in a top bunk, were you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I was. The bottom ones give me claustrophobia, with another mattress six inches over your head.\"\\n\\n Biron laughed. \"Then that explains it. The ship\u0027s gravitational force is directed toward its base, and falls off as we move away from it. In the top bunk you were probably twenty or thirty pounds lighter than on the floor. Were you ever on a passenger liner? A really big one?\"\\n\\n \"Once. When Father and I visited Tyrann last year.\"\\n\\n \"Well, on the liners they have the gravitation in all parts of the ship directed toward the outer hull, so that the long axis of the ship is always \u0027up,\u0027 no matter where you are. That\u0027s why the motors of one of those big babies are always lined up in a cylinder running right along the long axis. No gravity there.\"\\n\\n \"It must take an awful lot of power to keep an artificial gravity going.\"\\n\\n \"Enough to power a small town.\"\\n\\n \"There isn\u0027t any danger of our running short of fuel, is there?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry about that. Ships are fueled by the total conversion of mass to energy. Fuel is the last thing we\u0027ll run out of. The outer hull will wear away first.\"\\n\\n She was facing him. He noted that her face had been cleaned of its make-up and wondered how that had been done; probably with a handkerchief and as little of the drinking water as she could manage. She didn\u0027t suffer as a result, for her clear white skin was the more startlingly perfect against the black of her hair and eyes. Her eyes were very warm, thought Biron.\\n\\n The silence had lasted a little too long. He said hurriedly, \"You don\u0027t travel very much, do you? I mean, you were on a liner only once?\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"Once too often. If we hadn\u0027t gone to Tyrann, that filthy chamberlain wouldn\u0027t have seen me and-I don\u0027t want to talk about that.\"\\n\\n Biron let it. go. He said, \"Is that usual? I mean, not traveling.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid so. Father is always hopping around on state visits, opening agricultural expositions, dedicating buildings. He usually just makes some speech that Aratap writes for him. As for the rest of us, however, the more we stay in the Palace, the better the Tyranni like it. Poor Gillbret! The one and only time he left Rhodia was to attend the Khan\u0027s coronation as Father\u0027s representative. They\u0027ve never let him get into a ship again.\"\\n\\n Her eyes were downcast and, absently, she pleated the material of Biron\u0027s sleeve where it ended at the wrist. She said, \"Biron.\"\\n\\n \"Yes-Arta?\" He stumbled a bit, but it came out.\\n\\n \"Do you think Uncle Oil\u0027s story can be true?\"\\n\\n \"Do you suppose it could be his imagination? He\u0027s been brooding about the Tyranni for years, and he\u0027s never been able to do anything, of course, except to rig up spy beams, which is only childish, and he knows it. He may have built himself a daydream and, over the years, gradually come to believe in it. I know him, you see.\"\\n\\n \"Could be, but let\u0027s follow it up a little. We can travel to Lingane, anyway.\"\\n\\n They were closer to one another. He could have reached out and touched her, held her in his arms, kissed her.\\n\\n And he did so.\\n\\n It was a complete non sequitur. Nothing, it seemed to Biron, had led to it. One moment they were discussing Jumps and gravity and Gillbret, and the next she was soft and silky in his arms and soft silky on his lips.\\n\\n His first impulse was to say he was sorry, to go through all the silly motions of apology, but when he drew away and would have spoken, she still made no attempt at escape but rested her head in the crook of his left arm. Her eyes remained closed.\\n\\n So he said nothing at all but kissed her again, slowly and thoroughly. It was the best thing he could have done, and at the time he knew it.\\n\\n Finally she said, a bit dreamily, \"Aren\u0027t you hungry? I\u0027ll bring you some of the concentrate and warm it for you. Then, if you want to sleep, I can keep an eye on things for you. And-and I\u0027d better put on more of my clothes.\"\\n\\n She turned as she was about to go out the door. \"The food concentrate tastes very nice after you get used to it. Thank you for getting it.\"\\n\\n Somehow that, rather than the kisses, was the treaty of peace between them.\\n\\n When Gillbret entered the control room, hours later, he showed no surprise at finding Biron and Artemisia lost in a foolish kind of conversation. He made no remarks about the fact that Biron\u0027s arm was about his niece\u0027s waist.\\n\\n He said, \"When are we Jumping, Biron?\"\\n\\n \"In half an hour,\" said Biron.\\n\\n The half hour passed; the controls were set; conversation languished and died.\\n\\n At zero time Biron drew a deep breath and yanked a lever the full length of its arc, from left to right.\\n\\n It was not as it had been on the liner. The Remorseless was smaller and the Jump was consequently less smooth. Biron staggered, and for a split second things wavered.\\n\\n And then they were smooth and solid again.\\n\\n The stars in the visiplate had changed. Biron rotated the ship, so that the star field lifted, each star moving in a stately arc. One star appeared finally, brilliantly white and more than a point. It was a tiny sphere, a burning speck of sand. Biron caught it, steadied the ship before it was lost again, and turned the telescope upon it, throwing in the spectroscopic attachment.\\n\\n He turned again to the Ephemeris, and checked under the column headed \"Spectral Characteristics.\" Then he got out of the pilot\u0027s chair and said, \"It\u0027s still too far. I\u0027ll have to nudge up to it. But, anyway, that\u0027s Lingane right ahead.\"\\n\\n It was the first Jump he had ever made, and it was successful. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-like-dust-galactic-empire-1/page-11.html","bookId":1724,"book":{"id":1724,"title":"The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1)","description":"Storyline: The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1) \\n Biron Farrell was young and naïve, but he was growing up fast.
