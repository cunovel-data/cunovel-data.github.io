{"id":68518,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Biron Farrill\u0027s training in spationautics back on Earth had been largely academic. There had been the university courses in the various phases of spatial engineering, which, though half a semester was spent on the theory of the hyperatornic motor, offered little when it came to the actual manipulation of ships in space. The best and most skilled pilots learned their art in space and not in schoolrooms.\n He had managed to take off without actual accident, though that was more luck than design. The Remorseless answered the controls far more quickly than Biron had anticipated. He had manipulated several ships on Earth out into space and back to the planet, but those had been aged and sedate models, maintained for the use of students. They had been gentle, and very, very tired, and had lifted with an effort and spiraled slowly upward through the atmosphere and into space.\n The Remorseless, on the other hand, had lifted effortlessly, springing upward and whistling through the air, so that Biron had fallen backward out of his chair and all but dislocated his shoulder. Artemisia and Gillbret, who, with the greater caution of the inexperienced, had strapped themselves in, weFe bruised against the padded webbing. The Tyrannian prisoner had lain pressed against the wall, tearing heavily at his bonds and cursing in a monotone.\n Biron had risen shakily to his feet, kicked the Tyrannian into a brooding silence, and made his way along the wall rail, hand over hand against the acceleration, back to his seat. Forward blasts of power quivered the ship and reduced the rate of increasing velocity to a bearable quantity.\n They were in the upper reaches of the Rhodian atmosphere by then. The sky was a deep violet and the hull of the ship was hot with air friction, so that warmth could be felt within.\n It took hours thereafter to set the ship into an orbit about Rhodia. Biron could find no way of readily calculating the velocity necessary to overcome Rhodia\u0027s gravity. He had to work it by hit and miss, varying the velocity with puffs of power forward and backward, watching the massometer, which indicated their distance from the planet\u0027s surface by measuring the intensity of the gravitational field. Fortunately, the massometer was already calibrated for Rhodia\u0027s mass and radius. Without considerable experimentation, Biron could not have adjusted the calibration himself.\n Eventually, the massometer held steady and over a period of two hours showed no appreciable drift. Biron allowed himself to relax, and the others climbed out of their belts.\n Artemisia said, \"You don\u0027t have a very light touch, my Lord Rancher.\"\n \"I\u0027m flying, my lady,\" Biron replied curtly. \"If you can do better, you\u0027re welcome to try, but only after I myself disembark.\"\n \"Quiet, quiet, quiet,\" said Gillbret. \"The ship is too cramped for pettishness, and, in addition, since we are to be crushed into an inconvenient familiarity in this leaping prison pen, I suggest we discard the many \u0027lords\u0027 and \u0027ladies\u0027 which will otherwise encrust our conversation to an unbearable degree. I am Gillbret, you are Biron, she is Artemisia. I suggest we memorize those terms of address, or any variation we care to use. And as for piloting the ship, why not use the help of our Tyrannian friend here?\"\n The Tyrannian glared, and Biron said, \"No. There is no way we could trust him. And my own piloting will improve as I get the hang of this ship. I haven\u0027t cracked you up yet, have I?\"\n His shoulder still hurt as a result of the first lurch and, as usual, pain made him peevish.\n \"Well,\" said Gillbret, \"what do we do with him?\"\n \"I don\u0027t like to kill him in cold blood,\" said Biron, \"and that won\u0027t help us. It would just make the Tyranni doubly excited. Killing one of the master race is really the unforgivable sin.\"\n \"But what is the alternative?\"\n \"We\u0027ll land him.\"\n \"All right. But where?\"\n \"On Rhodia.\"\n \"What!\"\n \"It\u0027s the one place they won\u0027t be looking for us. Besides which, we\u0027ve got to go down pretty soon, anyway.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Look, this is the Commissioner\u0027s ship, and he\u0027s been using it for hopping about the surface of the planet. It isn\u0027t provisioned for space voyages. Before we go anywhere, we\u0027ll have to take complete inventory aboard ship, and at least make sure that we have enough food and water.\"\n Artemisia was nodding vigorously. \"That\u0027s right. Good! I wouldn\u0027t have thought of that myself. That\u0027s very clever, Biron.\"\n Biron made a deprecating gesture, but warmed with pleasure, nevertheless. It was the first time she had used his first name. She could be quite pleasant, when she tried.\n Gillbret said, \"But he\u0027ll radio our whereabouts instantly.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" said Biron. \"In the first place, Rhodia has its desolate areas, I imagine. We don\u0027t have to drop him into the business section of a city, or into the middle of one of the Tyrannian garrisons. Besides, he may not be so anxious to contact his superiors as you might think... Say, Private, what would happen to a soldier who allowed the Commissioner of the Khan to have his private cruiser stolen from him?\"\n The prisoner did not answer, but his lip line became, pale and thin.\n Biron would not have wanted to be in the soldier\u0027s place. To be sure, he could scarcely be blamed. There was no reason why he should have suspected trouble resulting from mere politeness to members of the Rhodian royal family. Sticking to the letter of the Tyrannian military code, he had refused to allow them aboard ship without the permission of his commanding officer. If the Director himself had demanded permission to enter, he insisted, he would have to deny it. But, in the meantime, they had closed in upon him, and by the time he realized he should have followed the military code still more closely and had his weapon ready, it was too late. A neuronic whip was practically touching his chest.\n Nor had he given in tamely, even then. It had taken a whip blast at his chest to stop him. And, even so, he could face only court-martial and conviction. No one doubted that, least of all the soldier.\n They had landed two days later at the outskirts of the city of Southwark. It had been chosen deliberately because it lay far from the main centers of Rhodian population. The Tyrannian soldier had been strapped into a repulsion unit and allowed to flutter downward some fifty miles from the nearest sizable town.\n The landing, on an empty beach, was only mildly jerky, and Biron, as the one least likely to be recognized, made the necessary purchases. Such Rhodian currency as Gillbret had had the presence of mind to bring with him had scarcely sufficed for elementary needs, since much of it went for a little biwheel and tow cart, on which he could carry the supplies away piecemeal.\n \"You might have stretched the money farther,\" said Artemisia, \"if you hadn\u0027t wasted so much of it on the Tyrannian mush you bought.\"\n \"I think there was nothing else to do,\" said Biron hotly. \"It may be Tyrannian mush to you, but it\u0027s a well-balanced food, and will see us through better than anything else I could have gotten.\"\n He was annoyed. It had been stevedore\u0027s work, getting all that out of the city and then aboard ship. And it had meant a considerable risk, buying it at one of the Tyrannian-run commissaries in the city. He had expected appreciation.\n And there was no alternative anyway. The Tyrannian forces had evolved an entire technique of supply adapted strictly to the fact that they used tiny ships. They couldn\u0027t afford the huge storage spaces of other fleets which were stacked with the carcasses of whole animals, neatly hung in rows. They had had to develop a standard food concentrate containing what was necessary in the way of calories and food factors and let it go at that. It took up only one twentieth of the space that an equivalent supply of natural animal food would take, and it could be piled up in the low-temperature storeroom like packaged bricks.\n \"Well, it tastes awful,\" said Artemisia.\n \"Well, you\u0027ll get used to it,\" retorted Biron, mimicking her petulance, so that she flushed and turned away angrily.\n What was bothering her, Biron knew, was simply the lack of space and all that accompanied the lack. It wasn\u0027t just a question of using a monotonous food stock because in that way more calories could be packed to the cubic inch. It was that there were no separate sleeping rooms, for instance. There were the engine rooms and the control room, which took up most of the ship\u0027s space. (After all, Biron thought, this is a warship, not a pleasure yacht.) Then there was the storeroom, and. one small cabin, with two tiers of three bunks on either side. The plumbing was located in a little niche just outside the cabin.\n It meant crowding; it meant a complete absence of privacy; and it meant that Artemisia would have to adjust herself to the fact that there were no women\u0027s clothes aboard, no mirrors, no washing facilities.\n Well, she would have to get used to it. Biron felt that he had done enough for her, gone sufficiently out of his way. Why couldn\u0027t she be pleasant about it and smile once in a while? She had a nice smile, and he had to admit that she wasn\u0027t bad, except for her temper. But oh, that temper!\n Well, why waste his time thinking about her?\n The water situation was the worst. Tyrann was a desert planet, in the first place, where water was at a premium and men knew its value, so none was included on board ship for washing purposes. Soldiers could wash themselves and their personal effects once they had landed on a planet. During trips a little grime and sweat would not hurt them. Even for drinking purposes, water was barely sufficient for the longer trips. After all, water could be neither concentrated nor dehydrated, but had to be carried in bulk; and the problem was aggravated by the fact that the water content of the food concentrates was quite low.\n There were distilling devices to re-use water lost by the body, but Biron, when he realized their function, felt sick and arranged for the disposal of waste products without attempt at water recovery. Chemically, it was a sensible procedure, but one has to be educated into that sort of thing.\n The second take-off was, comparatively, a: model of smoothness, and Biron spent time playing with the controls afterward. The control board resembled only in the dimmest fashion those of the ships he had handled on Earth. It had been compressed and compacted frightfully. As Biron puzzled out the action of a contact or the purpose of a dial, he wrote out minute directions on paper and pasted them appropriately on the board.\n Gillbret entered the pilot room.\n Biron looked over his shoulder. \"Artemisia\u0027s in the cabin, I suppose?\"\n \"There isn\u0027t anyplace else she could be and stay inside the ship.\"\n Biron said, \"When you see her, tell her I\u0027ll make up a bunk here in the pilot room. I\u0027d advise you to do the same, and let her have the cabin to herself.\" He muttered the addition, \"Now there\u0027s one childish girl.\"\n \"You have your moments, too, Biron,\" said Gillbret. \"You\u0027ll have to remember the sort of life she\u0027s used to.\"\n \"All right. I do remember it, and so what? What sort of life do you think I\u0027m used to? I wasn\u0027t born in the mine fields of some asteroidal belt, you know. I was born on the biggest Ranch of Nephelos. But if you\u0027re caught in a situation, you\u0027ve got to make the best of it. Damn it, I can\u0027t stretch the hull of the ship. It will hold just so much food and water, and I can\u0027t do anything about the fact that there isn\u0027t any shower bath. She picks on me as if I personally manufactured this ship.\" It was a relief to shout at Gillbret. It was a relief to shout at anybody.\n But the door opened again, and Artemisia stood there. She said, freezingly, \"I would refrain, Mr. Farrill, from shouting, if I were you. You can be distinctly heard all over the ship.\"\n \"That,\" said Biron, \"does not bother me. And if the ship bothers you, just remember that if your father hadn\u0027t tried to kill me off and marry you off, neither one of us would be here.\" c\n \"Don\u0027t talk about my father.\"\n \"I\u0027ll talk about anyone I please.\"\n Gillbret put his hands over his ears. \"Please!\"\n It brought the argument to a momentary halt. Gillbret said, \"Shall we discuss the matter of our destination now? It\u0027s obvious at this point that the sooner we\u0027re somewhere else and out of this ship, the more comfortable we\u0027ll be.\"\n \"I agree with you there, Oil,\" said Biron. \"Just let\u0027s go somewhere where I don\u0027t have to listen to her clacking. Talk about women on space ships!\"\n Artemisia ignored him and addressed Gillbret exclusively. \"Why don\u0027t we get out of the Nebular area altogether?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know about you,\" said Biron at once, \"but I\u0027ve got to get my Ranch back and do a little something about my father\u0027s murder. I\u0027ll stay in the Kingdoms.\"\n \"I did not mean,\" said Artemisia, \"that we were to leave forever; only till the worst of the search was over. I don\u0027t see what you intend doing about your Ranch, anyway. You can\u0027t get it back unless the Tyrannian Empire is broken to pieces, and I don\u0027t see you doing that.\"\n \"You never mind what I intend doing. It\u0027s my business.\"\n \"Might I make a suggestion?\" asked Gillbret mildly.\n He took silence for consent, and went on, \"Then suppose I tell you where we ought to go, and exactly what we ought to do to help break the Empire to pieces, just as Arta said.\"\n \"Oh? How do you propose doing that?\" said Biron.\n Gillbret smiled. \"My dear boy, you\u0027re taking a very amusing attitude. Don\u0027t you trust me? You look at me as though you think that any enterprise I might be interested in was bound to be a foolish one. I got you out of the Palace.\"\n \"I know that. I\u0027m perfectly willing to listen to you.\"\n \"Do so, then. I\u0027ve been waiting for over twenty years for my chance to get away from them. If I had been a private citizen, I could have done it long since; but through the curse of birth, I\u0027ve been in the public eye. And yet. if it hadn\u0027t been for the fact that I was born a Hinriad, I would not have attended the coronation of the present Khan of Tyrann, and in that case I would never have stumbled on the secret which will someday destroy that same Khan.\"\n \"Go on,\" said Biron.\n \"The trip from Rhodia to Tyrann was by Tyrannian warship, of course, as was the trip back. A ship like this, I might say, but rather larger. The trip there was uneventful. The stay on Tyrann had its points of amusements, but, for our purposes now, was likewise uneventful. On the trip back, however, a meteor hit us.\"\n \"What?\"\n Gillbret held up a hand. \"I know quite well it\u0027s an unlikely accident. The incidence of meteors in space-especially in interstellar space-is low enough to make the chances of collision with a ship completely insignificant, but it does happen, as you know. And it did happen in this case. Of course any meteor that does hit, even when it is the size of a pinhead, as most of them are, can penetrate the hull of any but the most heavily armored ship.\"\n \"I know,\" said Biron. \"It\u0027s a question of their momentum, which is a product of their mass and velocity. The velocity more than makes up for their lack of mass.\" He recited it glumly, like a school lesson, and caught himself watching Artemisia furtively.\n She had seated herself to listen to Gillbret, and she was so close to him that they were almost touching. It occurred to Biron that her profile was beautiful as she sat there, even if her hair was becoming a little bedraggled. She wasn\u0027t wearing her little jacket, and the fluffy whiteness of her blouse was still smooth and unwrinkled after forty-eight hours. He wondered how she managed that.\n The trip, he decided, could be quite wonderful if she would only learn to behave herself. The trouble was that no one had ever controlled her properly, that was all. Certainly not her father. She\u0027d become too used to having her own way. If she\u0027d been born a commoner, she would be a very lovely creature.\n He was just beginning to slip into a tiny daydream in which he controlled her properly and brought her to a state of proper appreciation of himself, when she turned her head and met his eye calmly. Biron looked away and fastened his attention instantly on Gillbret. He had missed a few sentences.\n \"I haven\u0027t the slightest idea why the ship\u0027s screen had failed. It was just one of those things to which no one will ever know the answer, but it had failed. Anyway, the meteor struck amidships. It was pebble-sized and piercing the hull slowed it just sufficiently so that it couldn\u0027t blaze its way out again through the other side. If it had done that, there would have been little harm to it, since the hull could have been temporarily patched in no time.\n \"As it was, however, it plunged into the control room, ricocheted off the far wall and slammed back and forth till it came to a halt. It couldn\u0027t have taken more than a fraction of a minute to come to a halt, but at an original velocity of a hundred miles a minute, it must have crisscrossed the room a hundred times. Both crewmen were cut to pieces, and I escaped only because I was in the cabin at the time.\n \"I heard the thin clang of the meteor when it originally penetrated the hull, then the click-clack of its bouncing, and the terrifying short screams of the two crewmen. When I jumped into the control room, there was only the blood everywhere and the torn flesh. The things that happened next I remember only vaguely, although for years I lived it over step by step in my nightmares.\n \"The cold sound of escaping air led me to the meteor hole. I slapped a disk of metal over it and air pressure made a decent seal of it. I found the little battered space pebble on the floor. It was warm to the touch, but I hit it with a spanner and split it in two. The exposed interior frosted over instantly. It was still at the temperature of space.\n \"I tied a cord to the wrist of each corpse and then tied each cord to a towing magnet. I dumped them through the air lock, heard the magnets clank against the hold, and knew that the hard-frozen bodies would follow the ship now wherever it went. You see, once we returned to Rhodia, I knew I would need the evidence of their bodies to show that it had been the meteor that had killed them and not I.\n \"But how was I to return? I was quite helpless. There was no way I could run the ship, and there was nothing I dared try there in the depths of interstellar space. I didn\u0027t even know how to use the sub-etheric communication system, so that I couldn\u0027t SOS. I could only let the ship travel on its own course.\"\n \"But you couldn\u0027t very well do that, could you?\" Biron said. He wondered if Gillbret \u0027were inventing this, either out of simple romantic imaginings or for some severely practical reason of his own. \"What about the Jumps through hyperspace? You must have managed those, or you wouldn\u0027t be here.\"\n \"A Tyrannian ship,\" said Gillbret, \"once the controls are properly set, will make any number of Jumps quite automatically.\"\n Biron stared his disbelief. Did Gillbret take him for a fool? \"You\u0027re making that up,\" he said.\n \"I am not. It\u0027s one of the damned military advances which won their wars for them. They didn\u0027t defeat fifty planetary systems, outnumbering Tyrann by hundreds of times in population and resources, just by playing mumblety-peg, you know. Sure they tackled us one at a time, and utilized our traitors very skillfully, but they had a definite military edge as well. Everyone knows that their tactics were superior to ours, and part of that was due to the automatic Jump. It meant a great increase in the maneuverability of their ships and made possible much more elaborate battle plans than any we could set up.\n \"I\u0027ll admit it\u0027s one of their best-kept secrets, this technique of theirs. I never learned it until I was trapped alone on the Bloodsucker-the Tyranni have the most annoying custom of naming their ships unpleasantly, though I suppose it\u0027s good psychology-and watched it happen. I watched it make the Jumps without a hand on the controls.\"\n \"And you mean to say that this ship can do that too?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised.\"\n Biron turned to the control board. There were still dozens of contacts he had not determined the slightest use for. Well, later!\n He turned to Gillbret again. \"And the ship took you home?\"\n \"No, it didn\u0027t. When that meteor wove its pattern through the control room, it didn\u0027t leave the board untouched. It would have been most amazing if it had. Dials were smashed, the casing battered and dented. There was no way of telling how the previous set of the controls had been altered, but it must have been somehow, because it never took me back to Rhodia.\n \"Eventually, of course, it began deceleration, and I knew the trip was theoretically over. I couldn\u0027t tell where I was, but I managed to maneuver the visiplate so that I could tell there was a planet close enough to show a disk in the ship telescope. It was blind luck, because the disk was increasing in size. The ship was heading for the planet.\n \"Oh, not directly. That would have been too impossible to hope for. If I had just drifted, the ship would have missed the planet by a million miles, at least, but at that distance I could use ordinary etheric radio. I knew how to do that. It was after this was allover that I began educating myself in electronics. I made up my mind that I would never be quite so helpless again. Being helpless is one of the things that isn\u0027t altogether amusing.\"\n Biron prompted, \"So you used the radio.\"\n Gillbret went on: \"Exactly, and they came and got me;\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"The men of the planet. It was inhabited.\"\n \"Well, the luck piles up. What planet was it?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"You mean they didn\u0027t tell you?\"\n \"Amusing, isn\u0027t it? They didn\u0027t. But it was somewhere among the Nebular Kingdoms!\"\n \"How did you know that?\"\n \"Because they knew the ship I was in was a Tyrannian vessel. They knew that by sight, and almost blasted it before I could convince them I was the only one on board alive.\"\n Biron put his large hands on his knees and kneaded them. \"Now hold on and pull back. I don\u0027t get this. If they knew it was a Tyrannian vessel and intending blasting it, isn\u0027t that the best proof that the world was not in the Nebular Kingdoms? that it was anywhere but there?\"\n \"No, by the Galaxy.\" Gillbret\u0027s eyes were shining, and his voice climbed in enthusiasm. \"It was in the Kingdoms. They took me to the surface, and what a world it was! There were men there from allover the Kingdoms. I could tell by the accents. And they had no fear of the Tyranni. The place was an arsenal. You couldn\u0027t tell from space. It might have been a rundown farming world, but the life of the planet was underground. Somewhere in the Kingdoms, my boy, somewhere there is that planet still, and it is not afraid of the Tyranni, and it is going to destroy the Tyranni as it would have destroyed the ship I was on then, if the crewmen had been still alive.\"\n Biron felt his heart bound. For a moment he wanted to believe.\n After all, maybe. Maybe! \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-like-dust-galactic-empire-1/page-10.html","bookId":1724,"book":{"id":1724,"title":"The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1) \n Biron Farrell was young and naïve, but he was growing up fast.
