{"id":68516,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Biron\u0027s throat was growing dry. He could have beaten either of the guards in fair fight. He knew that, and he itched for the chance. He might even have made a satisfactory showing against both together. But they had the whips, and he couldn\u0027t have lifted an arm without having them demonstrate the fact. Inside his mind he surrendered. There was no other way. But Gillbret said, \"Let him take his cloak, men.\" Biron, startled, looked quickly toward the little man and retracted that same surrender. He knew he had no cloak. The guard whose weapon was out clicked his heels as a gesture of respect. He motioned his whip at Biron. \"You heard milord. Get your cloak and snap it up!\" Biron stepped back as slowly as he dared. He retreated to the bookcase and squatted, groping behind the chair for his nonexistent cloak. And as his fingers clawed at the empty space behind the chair, he waited tensely for Gillbret. The visisonor was just a queer knobbed object to the guards. It would mean nothing to them that Gillbret fingered and stroked the knobs gently. Biron watched the muzzle of the whip intensely and allowed it to fill his mind. Certainly nothing else he saw or heard (thought he saw or heard) must enter. But how much longer? The armed guard said, \"Is your cloak behind that chair? Stand up!\" He took an impatient step forward, and then stopped. His eyes narrowed in deep amazement and he looked sharply to his left. That was it! Biron straightened and threw himself forward and down. He clasped the guard\u0027s knees and jerked. The guard was down with a jarring thud, and Biron\u0027s large fist closed over the other\u0027s hand, grasping for the neuronic whip it contained. The other guard had his weapon out, but for the moment it was useless. With his free hand, he was brushing wildly at the space before his eyes. Gillbret\u0027s high-pitched laugh sounded. \"Anything bothering you, Farrill?\" \"Don\u0027t see a thing,\" he grunted, and then, \"except this whip I\u0027ve got now.\" \"All right, then leave. They can\u0027t do anything to stop you. Their minds are full of sights and sounds that don\u0027t exist.\" Gillbret skipped out of the way of the writhing tangle of bodies. Biron wrenched his arms free and heaved upward. He brought his arm down solidly just below the other\u0027s ribs. The guard\u0027s face twisted in agony and his body doubled convulsively. Biron rose, whip in hand. \"Careful,\" cried Gillbret. But Biron did not turn quickly enough. The second guard was upon him, bearing him down again. It was a blind attack. What it was that the guard thought he was grasping, it was impossible to tell. That he knew nothing of Biron at the moment was certain. His breath rasped in Biron\u0027s ear and there was a continuous incoherent gurgle bubbling in his throat. Biron twisted in an attempt to bring his captured weapon into play and was frighteningly aware of the blank and empty eyes that must be aware of some horror invisible to anyone else. Biron braced his legs and shifted weight in an effort to break loose, quite uselessly. Three times he felt the guard\u0027s whip flung hard against his hip, and flinched at the contact. And then the guard\u0027s gurgle dissolved into words. He yelled, \"I\u0027ll get you all!\" and the very pale, almost invisible shimmer of the ionized air in the path of the whip\u0027s energy beam made its appearance. It swept wide through the air, and the path of the beam intersected Biron\u0027s foot. It was as though he had stepped into a bath of boiling lead. Or as if a granite block had toppled upon it. Or as if it had been crunched off by a shark. Actually, nothing had happened to it physically. It was only that the nerve endings that governed the sensation of pain had been universally and maximally stimulated, Boiling lead could have done no more. Biron\u0027s yell tore his throat raw, and he collapsed. It did not even occur to him that the fight was over. Nothing mattered but the ballooning pain. Yet, though Biron did not know it, the guard\u0027s grip had relaxed, and minutes later, when the young man could force his eyes open and blink away the tears, he found the guard backed against the wall, pushing feebly at nothing with both hands and giggling to himself. The first guard was still on his back, arms and legs spread-eagled now. He was conscious, but silent. His eyes were following something in an erratic path, and his body quivered a little. There was froth on his lips. Biron forced himself to his feet. He limped badly as he made his way to the wall. He used the butt of the whip and the guard slumped. Then back to the first, who made no defense either, his eyes moving silently to the very moment of unconsciousness. Biron sat down again, nursing his foot. He stripped shoe and stocking from it, and stared in surprise at the unbroken skin. He chafed it and grunted at the burning sensation. He looked up at Gillbret, who had put down his visisonor and was now rubbing one lean cheek with the back of his hand. \"Thank you,\" said Biron, \"for the help of your instrument.\" Gillbret shrugged. He said, \"There\u0027ll be more here soon. Get to Artemisia\u0027s room. Please! Quickly!\" Biron realized the sense of that. His foot had subsided to a quiet quiver of pain, but it felt swollen and puffy. He put on a stocking and tucked the shoe under his elbow. He already had one whip, and he relieved the second guard of the other. He stuffed it precariously within his belt. He turned at the door and asked, with a sense of crawling revulsion, \"What did you make them see, sir?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t control it. I just gave them all the power I could and the rest depended on their own complexes. Please don\u0027t stand there talking. Do you have the map to Artemisia\u0027s room?\" Biron nodded and set off down the corridor. It was quite empty. He could not walk quickly, since trying to do so made his walk a hobble. He looked at his watch, then remembered that he had somehow never had the time to adjust it to Rhodian local chronometry. It still ran on Standard Interstellar Time as used aboard ship, where one hundred minutes made an hour and a thousand a day. So the figure 876 which gleamed pinkly on the cool metal face of the watch meant nothing now. Still, it had to be well into the night, or into the planetary sleeping period, at any rate (supposing that the two did not coincide), as otherwise the halls would not be so empty and the bas-reliefs on the wall would not phosphoresce unwatched. He touched one idly as he passed, a coronation scene, and found it to be two-dimensional. Yet it gave the perfect illusion of standing out from the wall. It was sufficiently unusual for him to stop momentarily in order to examine the effect. Then he remembered and hurried on. The emptiness of the corridor struck him as another sign of the decadence of Rhodia. He had grown very conscious of all these symbols of decline now that he had become a rebel. As the center of an independent power, the Palace would always have had its sentries and its quiet wardens of the night. He consulted Gillbret\u0027s crude map and turned to the right, moving up a wide, curving ramp. There might have been processions here once, but nothing of that would be left now. He leaned against the proper door and touched the photo-signal. The door moved ajar a bit, then opened wide. \"Come in, young man.\" It was Artemisia. Biron slipped inside, and the door closed swiftly and silently. He looked at the girl and said nothing. He was gloomily conscious of the fact that his shirt was torn at the shoulder so that one sleeve flapped loosely, that his clothes were grimy and his face welted. He remembered the shoe he was still carrying, dropped it and wriggled his foot into it. Then he said, \"Mind if. I sit down?\" She followed him to the chair, and stood before him, a little annoyed. \"What happened? What\u0027s wrong with your foot?\" \"I hurt it,\" he said shortly. \"Are you ready to leave?\" She brightened. \"You\u0027ll take us, then?\" But Biron was in no mood to be sweet about it. His foot still twinged and he cradled it. He said, \"Look, get me out to a ship. I\u0027m leaving this damn planet. If you want to come along, I\u0027ll take you.\" She frowned. \"You might be more pleasant about it. Were you in a fight?\" \"Yes, I was. With your father\u0027s guards, who wanted to arrest me for treason. So much for my Sanctuary Right.\" \"Oh! I\u0027m sorry.\" \"I\u0027m sorry too. It\u0027s no wonder the Tyranni can lord it over fifty worlds with a handful of men. We help them. Men like your father would do anything to keep in power; they would forget the basic duties of a simple gentleman-Oh, never mind!\" \"I said I was sorry, Lord Rancher.\" She used the title with a cold pride. \"Please don\u0027t set yourself up as judge of my father. You don\u0027t know all the facts.\" \"I\u0027m not interested in discussing it. We\u0027ll have to leave in a hurry, before more of your father\u0027s precious guards come. Well, I don\u0027t mean to hurt your feelings. It\u0027s all right.\" Biron\u0027s surliness canceled out any meaning to his apology, but, damn it, he had never been hit by a neuronic whip before and it wasn\u0027t fun. And, by Space, they had owed him Sanctuary. At least that much. Artemisia felt angry. Not at her father, of course, but at the stupid young man. He was so young. Practically a child, she decided, scarcely older than herself, if that. The communicator sounded and she said sharply, \"Please wait a minute and we\u0027ll go.\" It was Gillbret\u0027s voice, sounding faintly. \"Arta? All right at your end?\" \"He\u0027s here,\" she whispered back. \"All right. Don\u0027t say anything. Just listen. Don\u0027t leave your room. Keep him there. There\u0027s going to be a search of the Palace, which there\u0027s no way of stopping. I\u0027ll try to think of something, but, meanwhile, don\u0027t move.\" He waited for no reply. Contact was broken. \"So that\u0027s that,\" said Biron. He had heard also. \"Shall I stay and get you into trouble, or shall I go out and give myself up? There\u0027s no reason to expect Sanctuary anywhere On Rhodia, I suppose.\" She faced him in a rage, crying in a choked whisper, \"Oh, shut up, you big, ugly fool.\" They glared at each other. Biron\u0027s feelings were hurt. In a way, he was trying to help her too. There was no reason for her to be insulting. She said, \"I\u0027m sorry,\" and looked away. \"That\u0027s all right,\" he said coldly, without meaning it. \"You\u0027re entitled to your opinion.\" \"You don\u0027t have to say the things you do about my father. You don\u0027t know what being Director is like. He\u0027s working for his people, whatever you may think.\" \"Oh, sure. He has to sell me to the Tyranni for the sake of the people. That makes sense.\" \"In a way, it does. He has to show them he\u0027s loyal. Otherwise, they might depose him and take over the direct rule of Rhodia. Would that be better?\" \"If a nobleman can\u0027t find Sanctuary-\" \"Oh, you think only of yourself. That\u0027s what\u0027s wrong with you.\" \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s particularly selfish not to want to die. At least for nothing. I\u0027ve got some fighting to do before I go. My father fought them.\" He knew he was beginning to sound melodramatic, but she affected him that way. She said, \"And what good did it do your father?\" \"None, I suppose. He was killed.\" Artemisia felt unhappy. \"I keep saying I\u0027m sorry, and this time I really mean it. I\u0027m all upset.\" Then, in defense, \"I\u0027m in trouble, too, you know.\" Biron remembered. \"I know. All right, let\u0027s start all over.\" He tried to smile. His foot was feeling better anyway. She said, in an attempt at lightness, \"You\u0027re not really ugly.\" Biron felt foolish. \"Oh well-\" Then he stopped, and Artemisia\u0027s hand flew to her mouth. Abruptly, their heads turned to the door. There was the sudden, soft sound of many ordered feet on the semi-elastic plastic mosaic that floored the corridor outside. Most passed by, but there was a faint, disciplined heel-clicking just outside the door, and the night signal purred. Gillbret had to work quickly. First, he had to hide his visisonor. For the first time he wished he had a better hiding place. Damn Hinrik for making up his mind so quickly this once, for not waiting till morning. He had to get away; he might never have another chance. Then he called the captain of the guard. He couldn\u0027t very well neglect a little matter of two unconscious guards and an escaped prisoner. The captain of the guard was grim about it. He had the two unconscious men cleared out, and then faced Gillbret. \"My lord, I am not quite clear from your message exactly what happened,\" he said. \"Just what you see,\" said Gillbret. \u0027They came to make their arrest, and the young man did not submit. He is gone, Space knows where.\" \"That is of little moment, my lord,\" said the captain. \"The Palace is honored tonight with the presence of a personage, so it is well guarded despite the hour. He cannot get out and we will draw the net through the interior. But how did he escape? My men were armed. He was not.\" \"He fought like a tiger. From that chair, behind which I hid-\" \"I am sorry, my lord, that you did not think to aid my men against an accused traitor.\" Gillbret looked scornful. \"What an amusing thought, Captain. When your men, wit{l doubled advantage in numbers and weapons, need help from myself, it is time you recruited yourself other men.\" \"Very well! We will search the Palace, find him, and see if he can repeat the performance.\" \"I shall accompany you, Captain.\" It was the captain \u0027s turn to raise his eyebrows. He said, \"I would not advise it, my lord. There would be some danger.\" It was the kind of remark that one did not make to a Hinriad. Gillbret knew that, but he only smiled and let the wrinkles fill his lean face. \"I know that,\" he said, \"but occasionally I find even danger amusing.\" It took five minutes for the company of guards to assemble. Gillbret, alone in his room during that time, called Artemisia. Biron and Artemisia had frozen at the purring of the little signal. It sounded a second time and then there was the cautious rap upon the door, and Gillbret\u0027s voice was heard. \"Do let me try, Captain,\" it said. Then, more loudly, \"Artemisia!\" Biron grinned his relief and took a step forward, but the girl put a sudden hand upon his mouth. She called out, \"One moment, Uncle Oil,\" and pointed desperately toward the wall. Biron could only stare stupidly. The wall was quite blank. Artemisia made a face and stepped quickly past him. Her hand on the wall caused a portion of it to slide noiselessly aside, revealing a dressing room. Her lips motioned a \"Get inside!\" and her hands were fumbling at the ornamental pin at her right shoulder. The unclasping of that pin broke the tiny force field that held an invisible seam tightly closed down the length of the dress. She stepped out of it. Biron turned around after stepping across what had been the wall, and its closing endured just long enough for him to see her throwing a white-furred dressing gown across her shoulders. The scarlet dress lay crumpled upon the chair. He looked about him and wondered if they would search Artemisia\u0027s room. He would be quite helpless if a search took place. There was no way out of the dressing room but the way he had entered, and there was nothing in it that could serve as a still more confined hiding place. Along one wall there hung a row of gowns, and the air shimmered very faintly before it. His hand passed easily through the shimmer, with only a faint tingling where it crossed his wrist, but then it was meant to repel only dust so that the space behind it could be kept aseptically clean. He might hide behind the skirts. It was what he was doing, really. He had manhandled two guards, with Gillbret\u0027s help, to get here, but, now that he was here, he was hiding behind a lady\u0027s skirts. A lady\u0027s skirts, in fact. Incongruously, he found himself wishing he had turned a bit sooner before the wall had closed behind him. She had quite a remarkable figure. It was ridiculous of him to have been so childishly nasty awhile back. Of course she was not to blame for the faults of her father. And now he could only wait, staring at the blank wall; waiting for the sound of feet within the room, for the wall to pull back once more, for the muzzles facing him again, this time without a visisonor to help him. He waited, holding a neuronic whip in each hand.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-like-dust-galactic-empire-1/page-8.html","bookId":1724,"book":{"id":1724,"title":"The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1)","description":"Storyline: The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1) Biron Farrell was young and naïve, but he was growing up fast.
