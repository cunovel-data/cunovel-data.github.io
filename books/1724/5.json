{"id":68513,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"The directorship of Rhodia is not ancient, when compared with Earth, as a habitat for Homo sapiens. It is not ancient even when compared with the Centaurian or Sirian worlds. The planets of Arcturus, for instance, had been settled for two hundred years when the first space ships circled the Horsehead Nebula to find the nest of hundreds of oxygen-water planets behind. They clustered thickly and it was a real find, for although planets infest space, few can satisfy the chemical necessities of the human organism. There are between one and two hundred billion radiant stars in the Galaxy. Among them are some five hundred billion planets. Of these, some have gravities more than 120 per cent that of Earth, or less than 60 per cent, and are therefore unbearable in the long run. Some are too hot, some too cold. Some have poisonous atmospheres. Planetary atmospheres consisting largely or entirely of neon, methane, ammonia, chlorine-even silicon tetrafluoride-have been recorded. Some planets lack water, one with oceans of almost pure sulphur dioxide having been described. Others lack carbon. Any one of these failings is sufficient, so that not one world in a hundred thousand can be lived on. Yet this still leaves an estimated four million habitable worlds. The exact number of these which are actually occupied is disputable. According to the Galactic Almanac, admittedly dependent on imperfect records, Rhodia was the l098th world settled by man. Ironically enough, Tyrann, eventually Rhodia\u0027s conqueror, was the 1099th. The pattern of history in the Trans-Nebular Region was distressingly similar to that elsewhere during the period of development and expansion. Planet republics were set up in rapid succession, each government confined to its own world. With expanding economy, neighboring planets were colonized and integrated with the home society. Small \"empires\" were established and these inevitably clashed. Hegemony over sizable regions was established by first one, then another of these governments, depending upon the fluctuations of the fortunes of war and of leadership. Only Rhodia maintained a lengthy stability, under the able dynasty of the Hinriads. It was perhaps well on the road to establishing finally a universal Trans-Nebular Empire in a stolid century or two, when the Tyranni came and did the job in ten years. Ironical that it should be the men of Tyrann. Until then, during the seven hundred years of its existence, Tyrann had done little better than maintain a precarious autonomy, thanks largely to the undesirability of its barren landscape, which, because of a planetary water dearth, was largely desert. But even after the Tyranni came, the Directorship of Rhodia continued. It had even grown. The Hinriads were popular with the people, so their existence served as a means of easy control. The Tyranni did not care who got the cheers as long as they themselves received the taxes. To be sure, the Directors were no longer the Hinriads of old. The Directorship had always been elective within the family so that the ablest might be chosen. Adoptions into the family had been encouraged for the same purpose. But now the Tyranni could influence the elections for other reasons, and twenty years earlier, for instance, Hinrik (fifth of that name) had been chosen Director. To the Tyranni, it had seemed a useful choice. Hinrik had been a handsome man at the time of his election, and he still made an impressive appearance when he addressed the Rhodian Council. His hair had grayed smoothly, and his thick mustache remained, startingly enough, as black as his daughter\u0027s eyes. At the moment he faced his daughter, and she was furious. She lacked only two inches of his height, and the Director lacked less than an inch of six feet. She was a smoldering girl, dark of hair and of eyes, and, at the moment, loweringly dark of complexion. She said again, \"I can\u0027t do it! I won\u0027t do it!\" Hinrik said, \"But, Arta, Arta, this is unreasonable. What am I to do? What can I do? In my position, what choice have I?\" \"If Mother were alive, she would find a way out.\" And she stamped her foot. Her full name was Artemisia, a royal name that had been borne by at least one female of the Hinriads in every generation. \"Yes, yes, no doubt. Bless my soul! What a way your mother had with her! There are times when you seem all of her and none of me. But surely, Arta, you haven\u0027t given him a chance. Have you observed his-ah-better points?\" \"Which are those?\" \"The ones which...\" He gestured vaguely, thought a while and gave it up. He approached her and would have put a consoling hand upon her shoulder, but she squirmed away from him, her scarlet gown shimmering in the air. \"I have spent an evening with him,\" she said bitterly, \"and he tried to kiss me. It was disgusting!\" \"But everyone kisses, dear. It\u0027s not as though this were your grandmother\u0027s time-of respected memory. Kisses are nothing-less than nothing. Young blood, Arta, young blood!\" \"Young blood, my foot. The only time that horrible little man has had young blood in him these fifteen years has been immediately after a transfusion. He\u0027s four inches shorter than I am, Father. How can I be seen in public with a pygmy?\" \"He\u0027s an important man. Very important!\" \"That doesn\u0027t add a single inch to his height. He is bowlegged, as they all are, and his breath smells.\" \"His breath smells?\" Artemisia wrinkled her nose at her father. \"That\u0027s right; it smells. It has an unpleasant odor. I didn\u0027t like it and I let him know it.\" Hinrik.dropped his jaw wordlessly for a moment, then said in a hoarse half whisper, \"You let him know it? You implied that a high official of the Royal Court of Tyrann could have an unpleasant personal characteristic?\" \"He did! I have a nose, you know! So when he got too close, I just held it and pushed. A figure of man to admire, that one is. He went flat on his back, with his legs sticking up.\" She gestured with her fingers in illustration, but it was lost on Hinrik, who, with a moan, hunched his shoulders and put his hands over his face. He peered miserably from between two fingers. \"What will happen now? How can you act so?\" \"It didn\u0027t do me any good. Do you know what he said? Do you know what he said? It was the last straw. It was absolutely the limit. I made up my mind then that I couldn\u0027t stand that man if he were ten feet taIl.\" \"But-but-what did he say?\" \"He said-straight out of a video, Father-he said, \u0027Ha! A spirited wench! I like her all the better for that!\u0027 and two servants helped him stagger to his feet. But he didn\u0027t try to breathe in my face again.\" Hinrik doubled into a chair, leaned forward and regarded Artemisia earnestly. \"You could go through the motions of marrying him, couldn\u0027t you? You needn\u0027t be in earnest. Why not merely, for the sake of political expediency-\" \"How do you mean, not in earnest, Father? Shall I cross the fingers of my left hand while signing the contract with my right?\" Hinrik looked confused. \"No, of course not. What good would that do? How would crossing fingers alter the validity of the contract? Really, Arta, I\u0027m surprised at your stupidity.\" Artemisia sighed. \"What do you mean, then?\" \"Mean by what? You see, you\u0027ve disrupted things. I can\u0027t keep my mind on matters properly when you argue with me. What was I saying?\" \"I was merely to pretend I was getting married, or something. Remember?\" \"Oh yes. I mean, you needn\u0027t take it too seriously, you see.\" \"I can have lovers, I suppose.\" Hinrik stiffened and frowned. \"Arta! I brought you up to be a modest, self-respecting girl. So did your mother. How can you say such things? It\u0027s shameful.\" \"But isn\u0027t that what you mean? \" \"I can say it. I am a man, a mature man. A girl like you ought not to repeat it.\" \"Well, I have repeated it and it\u0027s out in the open. I don\u0027t mind lovers. I\u0027ll probably have to have them if I\u0027m forced to marry for reasons of state, but there are limits.\" She placed her hands upon her hips, and the cape-like sleeves of her gown slithered away from her tanned and dimpled shoulders. \"What will I do between lovers? He\u0027ll still be my husband and I just can\u0027t bear that particular thought.\" \"But he\u0027s an old man, my dear. Life with him would be short.\" \"Not short enough, thank you. Five minutes ago he had young blood. Remember?\" Hinrik spread his hands wide and let them drop. \"Arta, the man is a Tyrannian, and a powerful one. He is in good odor at the Khan\u0027s court.\" \"The Khan might think it\u0027s a good odor. He probably would. He probably stinks himself.\" Hinrik\u0027s mouth was an O of horror. Automatically, he looked over his shoulder. Then he said hoarsely, \"Don\u0027t ever say anything like that again.\" \"I will if I feel like it. Besides, the man has had three wives already.\" She forestalled him. \"Not the Khan, the man you want me to marry.\" \"But they\u0027re dead,\" Hinrik explained earnestly. \"Arta, they\u0027re not alive. Don\u0027t think that. How can you imagine I would let my daughter marry a bigamist? We\u0027ll have him produce documents. He married them consecutively, not simultaneously, and they\u0027re dead now, entirely dead, all of them.\" \"It\u0027s no wonder.\" \"Oh, bless my soul, what shall I do?\" He made a last effort at dignity. \"Arta, it is the price of being a Hinriad and a Director\u0027s daughter.\" \"I didn\u0027t ask to be a Hinriad and a Director\u0027s daughter.\" \"That has nothing to do with it. It is just that the history of all the Galaxy, Arta, shows that there are occasions when reasons of state, the safety of planets, the best interests of peoples require that, uh-\" \"That some poor girl prostitute herself.\" \"Oh, this vulgarity! Someday, you\u0027ll see-someday you\u0027ll say something of the sort in public.\" \"Well, that\u0027s what it is, and I won\u0027t do it. I\u0027d rather die. I\u0027d rather do anything. And I will.\" The Director got to his feet and held out his arms to her. His lips trembled and he said nothing. She ran to him in a sudden agony of tears and clung desperately to him. \"I can\u0027t, Daddy. I can\u0027t. Don\u0027t make me.\" He patted her awkwardly. \"But if you don\u0027t, what will happen? If the Tyranni are displeased, they will remove me, imprison me, maybe even exec-\" He gagged on the word. \"These are very unhappy times, Arta-very unhappy. The Rancher of Widemos was condemned last week and I believe he has been executed. You remember him, Arta? He was at court half a year ago. A big man, with a round head and deep-set eyes. You were frightened of him at first. \" \"I remember.\" \"Well, he is probably dead. And who knows? Myself next, perhaps. Your poor, harmless old father next. It is a bad time. He was at our court and that\u0027s very suspicious.\" She suddenly held herself out at arm\u0027s length. \"Why should it be suspicious? You weren\u0027t involved with him, were you?\" \"I? Indeed not. But if we openly insult the Khan of Tyrann by refusing an alliance with one of his favorites, they may choose to think even that.\" Hinrik\u0027s hand wringing was interrupted by the muted buzz of the extension. He started uneasily. \"I\u0027ll take it in my own room. You just rest. You\u0027ll feel better after a nap. You\u0027ll see, you\u0027ll see. It\u0027s just that you\u0027re a little on edge now.\" Artemisia looked after him and frowned. Her\u0027 face was intensely thoughtful, and for minutes only the gentle tide of her breasts betrayed life. There was the sound of stumbling feet at the door, and she turned. \"What is it?\" The tone was sharper than she had intended. It was Hinrik, his face sallow with fear. \"Major Andros was calling.\" \"Of the Outer Police?\" Hinrik could only nod. Artemisia cried, \"Surely, he\u0027s not-\" She paused reluctantly at the threshold of putting the horrible thought into words, but waited in vain for enlightenment. \"There is a young man who wants an audience. I don\u0027t know him. Why should he come here? He\u0027s from Earth.\" He was gasping for breath and staggered as he spoke, as though his mind were on a turntable and he had to follow it in its gyrations. The girl ran to him and seized his elbow. She said sharply, \"Sit down, Father. Tell me what has happened.\" She took him and some of the panic drained out of his face. \"I don\u0027t know exactly,\" he whispered. \"There\u0027s a young man coming here with details concerning a plot on my life. On my life. And they tell me I ought to listen to him.\" He smiled foolishly. \"I\u0027m loved by the people. No one would want to kill me. Would they? Would they?\" He was watching her eagerly, and relaxed when she said, \"Of course no one would want to kill you.\" Then he was tense again. \"Do you think it might be they?\" \"Who?\" He leaned over to whisper. \"The Tyranni. The Rancher of Widemos was here yesterday, and they killed him.\" His voice ascended the scale. \"And now they\u0027re sending someone over to kill me.\" Artemisia gripped his shoulder with such force that his mind turned to the present pain. She said, \"Father! Sit quietly! Not a word! Listen to me. No one will kill you. Do you hear me? No one will kill you. It was six months ago that the Rancher was here. Do you remember? Wasn\u0027t it six months ago? Think!\" \"So long?\" whispered the Director. \"Yes, yes, it must have been so.\" \"Now you stay here and rest. You\u0027re overwrought. I\u0027ll see the young man myself and then I\u0027ll bring him to you if it\u0027s safe;\" \"Will you, Arta? Will you? He won\u0027t hurt a woman. Surely he wouldn\u0027t hurt a woman.\" She bent suddenly and kissed his cheek. \"Be careful,\" he murmured, and closed his eyes wearily.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-like-dust-galactic-empire-1/page-5.html","bookId":1724,"book":{"id":1724,"title":"The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1)","description":"Storyline: The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1) Biron Farrell was young and naïve, but he was growing up fast.
