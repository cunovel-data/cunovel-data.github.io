{"id":68511,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The first hour of a space-ship\u0027s rise from planetary thralldom is the most prosaic. There is the confusion of departure, which is much the same in essence as that which must have accompanied the shoving off of the first hollowed-out tree trunk on some primeval river.\n You have your accommodations; your luggage is taken care of; there is the first stiff moment of strangeness and meaningless hustle surrounding you. The shouted last-moment intimacies, the quieting, the muted clang of the air locks, followed by the slow soughing of air as the locks screw inward automatically, like gigantic drills, becoming airtight.\n Then the portentous silence and the red signs flicking in every room: \"Adjust acceleration suits...Adjust acceleration suits...Adjust acceleration suits.\"\n The stewards scour the corridors, knocking shortly on each door and jerking it open. \"Beg pardon. Suits on.\"\n You battle with the suits, cold, tight, uncomfortable, but cradled in a hydraulic system which absorbs the sickening pressures of the take-off.\n There is the faraway rumble of the atom-driven motors, on low power for atmospheric maneuvering, followed instantly by the giving back against the slow-yielding oil of the suit cradle. You recede almost indefinitely back, then very slowly forward again as the acceleration decreases. If you survive nausea during this period, you are probably safe from space sickness for duration.\n The view-room was not open to the passengers for the first three hours of the flight, and there was a long line waiting when the atmosphere had been left behind and the double doors were ready to separate. There were present not only the usual hundred-percent turnout of all Planetaries (those, in other words, who had never been in space before), but a fair proportion of the more experienced travelers as well.\n The vision of Earth from space, after all, was one of the tourist \"musts.\"\n The view-room was a bubble on the ship\u0027s \"skin,\" a bubble of curved two-foot-thick, steel-hard transparent plastic. The retractile iridium-steel lid which protected it against the scouring of the atmosphere and its dust particles had been sucked back. The lights were out and the gallery was full. The faces peering over the bars were clear in the Earth-shine.\n For Earth was suspended there below, a gigantic and gleaming orange-and-blue-and-white-patched balloon. The hemisphere showing was almost entirely sunlit; the continents between the clouds, a desert orange, with thin, scattered lines of green. The seas were blue, standing out sharply against the black of space where they met the horizon. And all around in the black, undusted sky were the stars.\n They waited patiently, those who watched.\n It was not the sunlit hemisphere they wanted. The polar cap, blinding bright, was shifting down into view as the ship maintained the slight, unnoticed sidewise acceleration that was lifting it out of the ecliptic. Slowly the shadow of night encroached upon the globe and the huge World-Island of Eurasia-Africa majestically took the stage, north side \"down.\"\n Its diseased, unliving soil hid its horror under a night-induced play of jewels. The radioactivity of the soil was a vast sea of iridescent blue, sparkling in strange festoons that spelled out the manner in which the nuclear bombs had once landed, a full generation before the force-field defense against nuclear explosions had been developed so that no other world could commit suicide in just that fashion again.\n The eyes watched until, with the hours, Earth was a bright little half coin in the endless black.\n Among the watchers was Biron Farrill. He sat by himself in the front row, arms upon the railing, eyes brooding and thoughtful. This was not the way he had expected to leave Earth. It was the wrong manner, the wrong ship, the wrong destination.\n His tanned forearm rubbed against the stubble of his chin and he felt guilty about not having shaved that morning. He\u0027d go back to his room after a while and correct that. Meanwhile, he hesitated to leave. There were people here. In his room he would be alone.\n Or was that just the reason he should leave?\n He did not like the new feeling he had, that of being hunted; that of being friendless.\n All friendship had dropped from him. It had shriveled from the very moment he had been awakened by the phone call less than twenty-four hours earlier.\n Even in the dormitory he had become an embarrassment. Old Esbak had pounced upon him when he had returned after his talk with Jonti in the student lounge. Esbak was in turmoil; his voice overshrill.\n \"Mr. Farrill, I\u0027ve been looking for you. It has been a most unfortunate incident. I can\u0027t understand it. Do you have any explanation?\"\n \"No,\" he half shouted, \"I don\u0027t. When can I get into my room and get my stuff out?\"\n \"In the morning, I am sure. We\u0027ve just managed to get the equipment up here to test the room. There is no longer any trace of radioactivity above normal background level. It was a very fortunate escape for you. It must have missed you only by minutes.\"\n \"Yes, yes, but if you don\u0027t mind, I would like to rest.\"\n \"Please use my room till morning and then we\u0027ll get you relocated for the few days remaining you. Umm, by the way, Mr. Farrill, if you don\u0027t mind, there is another matter.\"\n He was being overly polite. Biron could almost hear the egg-shells give slightly beneath his finicky feet.\n \"What other matter?\" asked Biron wearily.\n \"Do you know of anyone who might have been interested in-er-hazing you?\"\n \"Hazing me like this? Of course not.\"\n \"What are your plans, then? The school authorities would, of course, be most unhappy to have publicity arise as a result of this incident.\"\n How he kept referring to it as an \"incident\"! Biron said dryly, \"I understand you. But don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not interested in investigations or in the police. I\u0027m leaving Earth soon, and I\u0027d just as soon not have my own plans disrupted. I\u0027m not bringing any charges. After all, I\u0027m still alive.\"\n Esbak had been almost indecently relieved. It was all they wanted from him. No unpleasantness. It was just an incident to be forgotten.\n He got into his old room again at seven in the morning. It was quiet and there was no murmuring in the closet. The bomb was no longer there, nor was the counter. They had probably been taken away by Esbak and thrown into the lake. It came under the head of destroying evidence, but that was the school\u0027s worry. He threw his belongings into suitcases and then called the desk for assignment to another room. The lights were working again, he noticed, and so, of course, was the visiphone. The one remnant of last night was the twisted door, its lock melted away.\n They gave him another room. That established his intention to stay for anyone that might be listening. Then, using the hall phone, he had called an air cab. He did not think anyone saw him. Let the school puzzle out his disappearance however they pleased.\n For a moment he had caught sight of Jonti at the space port. They met in the fashion of a glancing blow. Jonti said nothing; gave no sign of recognition, but after he had passed by, there were in Biron\u0027s hand a featureless little black globe that was a personal capsule and a ticket for passage to Rhodia.\n He spent a moment upon the personal capsule. It was not sealed. He read the message later in his room. It was a simple introduction with minimum wordage.\n Biron\u0027s thoughts rested for a while upon Sander Jonti, as he watched Earth shrivel with time there in the view-room. He had known the man very superficially until Jonti had whirled so devastatingly into his life, first to save it and then to set it upon a new and untried course. Biron had known his name; he had nodded when they passed; had exchanged polite formalities occasionally, but that was all. He had not liked the man, had not liked his coldness, his overdressed, overmannered personality. But all that had nothing to do with affairs now.\n Biron rubbed his crew cut with a restless hand and sighed. He actually found himself hungering for Jonti\u0027s presence. The man was at least master of events. He had known what to do; he had known what Biron was to do; he had made Biron do it. And now Biron was alone and feeling very young, very helpless, very friendless, and almost frightened.\n Through it all, he studiously avoided thinking of his father. It would not help.\n \"Mr. Malaine.\"\n The name was repeated two or three times before Biron started at the respectful touch upon his shoulder and looked up.\n The robot messenger said again, \"Mr. Malaine,\" and for five seconds Biron stared blankly, until he remembered that that was his temporary name. It had been penciled lightly upon the ticket which Jonti had given him. A stateroom had been reserved in that name.\n \"Yes, what is it? I am Malaine.\" The messenger\u0027s voice hissed very faintly as the spool within whirled off its message. \"I have been asked to inform you that your stateroom has been changed, and that your baggage has already been shifted. If you will see the purser, you will be given your new key. We trust that this will cause no inconvenience for you.\"\n \"What\u0027s all this?\" Biron whirled in his seat, and several of the thinning group of passengers, still watching, looked up at the explosive sound. \"What\u0027s the idea?\"\n Of course, it was no use arguing with a machine that had merely fulfilled its function. The messenger had bowed its metal head respectfully, its gently fixed imitation of a human smile of ingratiation unchanging, and had left.\n Biron strode out of the view-room and accosted the ship\u0027s officer at the door with somewhat more energy than he had planned.\n \"Look here. I want to see the captain.\"\n The officer showed no surprise. \"Is it important, sir?\"\n \"It sure as Space is. I\u0027ve just had my stateroom shifted without my permission and I\u0027d like to know the meaning of it.\"\n Even at the time, Biron felt his anger to be out of proportion to the cause, but it represented an accumulation of resentment. He had nearly been killed; he had been forced to leave Earth like a skulking criminal; he was going he knew not where to do he knew not what; and now they were pushing him around aboard ship. It was the end.\n Yet, through it all, he had the uncomfortable feeling that Jonti, in his shoes, would have acted differently, perhaps more wisely. Well, he wasn\u0027t Jonti.\n The officer said, \"I will call the purser.\"\n \"I want the captain,\" insisted Biron.\n \"If you wish, then.\" And after a short conversation through the small ship\u0027s communicator suspended from his lapel, he said urbanely, \"You will be called for. Please Walt.\"\n Captain Hirm Gordell was a rather short and thickset man, who rose politely and leaned over his desk to shake hands with Biron when the latter entered.\n \"Mr. Malaine,\" he said, \"I am sorry we had to trouble you.\"\n He had a rectangular face, iron-gray hair, a short, well-kept mustache of slightly darker hue, and a clipped smile.\n \"So am I,\" said Biron. \"I had a stateroom reservation to which I was entitled and I feel that not even you, sir, had the right to change it without my permission.\"\n \"Granted, Mr. Malaine. But, you understand, it was rather an emergency. A last-minute arrival, an important man, insisted on being moved to a stateroom closer the gravitational center of the ship. He had a heart condition and it was important to keep ship\u0027s gravity as low as possible for him. We had no choice.\"\n \"All right, but why pick on me as the one to be shifted.\"\n \"It had to be someone. You were traveling alone; you are a young man who we felt would have no difficulty in taking a slightly higher gravity.\" His eyes traveled automatically up and down Biron\u0027s six-feet-two of hard musculature. \"Be. sides, you will find your new room rather more elaborate than your old one. You have not lost by the exchange. No indeed.\"\n The captain stepped from behind his desk. \"May I show you your new quarters personally?\"\n Biron found it difficult to maintain his resentment. It seemed reasonable, this whole matter, and then again, not reasonable either.\n The captain was saying as they left his quarters, \"May I have your company at my table for tomorrow night\u0027s dinner? Our first Jump is scheduled for that time.\"\n Biron heard himself saying, \"Thank you. I will be honored.\"\n Yet he thought the invitation strange. Granted that the captain was merely trying to soothe him, yet surely the method was stronger than necessary.\n The captain\u0027s table was a long one, taking up an entire wall of the salon. Biron found himself near the center, taking an unsuitable precedence over others. Yet there was his place card before him. The steward had been quite firm; there was no mistake.\n Biron was not particularly overmodest. As son of the Rancher of Widemos, there had never been any necessity for the development of any such characteristic. And yet as Biron Malaine, he was quite an ordinary citizen, and these things ought not to happen to ordinary citizens.\n For one thing, the captain had been perfectly correct about his new stateroom. It was more elaborate. His original room had been what his ticket called for, a single, second class, while the replacement was a double room, first. There was a bathroom adjoining, private, of course, equipped with a stall shower and an air dryer.\n It was near \"officer\u0027s country,\" and the presence of uniforms was almost overpowering. Lunch had been brought to his room on silver service. A barber made a sudden appearance just before dinner. All this was perhaps to be expected when one traveled on a luxury space liner, first class, but it was too good for Biron Malaine.\n It was far too good, for by the time the barber had arrived, Biron had just returned from an afternoon walk that had taken him through the corridors in a purposely devious path. There had been crewmen in his path wherever he had turned-polite, clinging. He shook them free somehow and reached 140 D, his first room, the one he had never slept in.\n He stopped to light a cigarette and, in the interval spent thus, the only passenger in sight turned a corridor. Biron touched the signal light briefly and there was no answer.\n Well, the old key had not been taken from him yet. An oversight, no doubt. He placed the thin oblong sliver of metal into its orifice and the unique pattern of leaden opacity within the aluminum sheath activated the tiny phototube. The door opened and he took one step inside.\n It was all he needed. He left and the door closed automatically behind him. He had learned one thing immediately. His old room was not occupied; neither by an important personage with a weak heart nor by anyone else. The bed and furnishings were too neat; no trunks, no toilet articles were in sight; the very air of occupancy was missing.\n So the luxury they were surrounding him with served only to prevent his taking further action to get back his original room. They were bribing him to stay quietly out of the old room. Why? Was it the room they were interested in, or was it himself?\n And now he sat at the captain\u0027s table with the questions unanswered and rose politely with the rest as the captain entered, strode up the steps of the dais on which the long table was set, and took his place.\n Why had they moved him?\n There was music in the ship, and the walls that separated the salon from the view-room had been retracted. The lights were low and tinged with orange-red. The worst of such space sickness as there might have been after the original acceleration or as the result of first exposure to the minor gravity variations between various parts of the ship had passed by now; the salon was full.\n The captain leaned forward slightly and said to Biron, \"Good evening, Mr. Malaine. How do you find your new room?\"\n \"Almost too satisfactory, sir. A little rich for my way of life.\" He said it in a flat monotone, and it seemed to him that a faint dismay passed momentarily over the captain\u0027s face.\n Over the dessert, the skin of the view-room\u0027s glass bubble slid smoothly back into its socket, and the lights dimmed to nearly nothing. Neither sun, earth, nor any planet was in view on that large, dark screen. They were facing the Milky Way, that longwise view of the Galactic Lens, and it made a luminous diagonal track among the hard, bright stars.\n Automatically the tide of conversation ebbed. Chairs shifted so that all faced the stars. The dinner guests had become an audience, the music a faint whisper.\n The voice over the amplifiers was clear and well balanced in the gathered question.\n \"Ladies, gentlemen! We are ready for our first Jump. Most of you, I suppose, know, at least theoretically, what a Jump is. Many of you, however-more than half, in point of fact-have never experienced one. It is to those last I would like to speak in particular.\n \"The Jump is exactly what the name implies. In the fabric of space-time itself, it is impossible to travel faster than the speed of light. That is a natural law, first discovered by one of the ancients, the traditional Einstein, perhaps, except that so many things are credited to him. Even at the speed of light, of course, it would take years, in resting time, to reach the stars.\n \"Therefore one leaves the space-time fabric to enter the little-known realm of hyperspace, where time and distance have no meaning. It is like traveling across a narrow isthmus to pass from one ocean to another, rather than remaining at sea and circling a continent to accomplish the same distance.\n \"Great amounts of energy are required, of course, to enter this \u0027space within space\u0027 as some call it, and a great deal of ingenious calculation must be made to insure re-entry into ordinary space time at the proper point. The result of the expenditure of this energy and intelligence is that immense distances can be traversed in zero time. It is only the Jump which makes interstellar travel possible.\n \"The Jump we are about to make will take place in about ten minutes. You will be warned. There is never more than some momentary minor discomfort; therefore, I hope all of you will remain calm. Thank you.\"\n The ship lights went out altogether, and there were only the stars left.\n It seemed a long while before a crisp announcement filled the air momentarily: \"The Jump will take place in exactly one minute.\" And then the same voice counted the seconds backwards: \"Fifty...forty...thirty...twenty... ten...five...three...two...one...\"\n It was as though there had been a momentary discontinuity in existence, a bump which joggled only the deep inside of a man\u0027s bones.\n In that immeasurable fraction of a second, one hundred light-years had passed, and the ship, which had been on the outskirts of the solar system, was now in the depths of interstellar space.\n Someone near Biron said shakily, \"Look at the stars!\"\n In a moment the whisper had taken life through the large room and hissed itself across the tables: \"The stars! See!\"\n In that same immeasurable fraction of a second the star view had changed radically. The center of the great Galaxy, which stretched thirty thousand light-years from tip to tip, was closer now, and the stars had thickened in number. They spread across the black velvet vacuum in a fine powder, back-dropping the occasional brightness of the nearby stars.\n Biron, against his will, remembered the beginning of a poem he himself had once written at the sentimental age of nineteen, on the occasion of his first space flight; the one that had first taken him to the Earth he was now leaving. His lips moved silently:\n \"The stars, like dust, encircle me\n In living mists of light;\n And all of space I seem to see\n In one vast burst of sight.\"\n The lights went on then, and Biron\u0027s thoughts were snapped out of space as suddenly as they had entered it. He was in a space liner\u0027s salon again, with a dinner dragging to an end, and the hum of conversation rising to a prosaic level again.\n He glanced at his wrist watch, half looked away, then, very slowly, brought the wrist watch into focus again. He stared at it for a long minute. It was the wrist watch he had left in his bedroom that night; it had withstood the killing radiation of the bomb, and he had collected it with the rest of his belongings the next morning. How many times had he looked at it since then? How many times had he stared at it, taken mental note of the time and no note at all of the other piece of information it shouted at him?\n For the plastic wristband was white, not blue. It was white!\n Slowly the events of that night, all of them, fell into place. Strange how one fact could shake an the confusion out of them.\n He rose abruptly, murmuring, \"Pardon me!\" under his breath. It was a breach of etiquette to leave before the captain, but that was a matter of small importance to him then.\n He hastened to his room, striding up the ramps rapidly, rather than waiting for the non-gravity elevators. He locked the door behind him and looked quickly through the bathroom and the built-in closets. He had no real hope of catching anyone. What they had had to do, they must have done hours ago.\n Carefully, he went through his baggage. They had done a thorough job. With scarcely any sign to show that they had come and gone, they had carefully withdrawn his identification papers, a packet of letters from his father, and even his capsular introduction to Hinrik of Rhodia.\n That was why they had moved him. It was neither the old room nor the new that they were interested in; merely the process of moving. For nearly an hour they must have legitimately-legitimately, by Space!-concerned themselves with his baggage, and served their own purposes thereby.\n Biron sank down upon the double bed and thought furiously, but it didn\u0027t help. The trap had been perfect. Everything had been planned. Had it not been for the completely unpredictable chance of his leaving his wrist watch in the bedroom that night, he would not even now have realized how close-meshed the Tyranni\u0027s net through space was.\n There was a soft burr as his door signal sounded.\n \"Come in,\" he said.\n It was the steward, who said respectfully, \"The captain wishes to know if there is anything he can do for you. You seemed ill as you left the table.\"\n \"I\u0027m all right,\" he said.\n How they watched him! And in that moment he knew that there was no escape, and that the ship was carrying him politely, but surely, to his death. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-like-dust-galactic-empire-1/page-3.html","bookId":1724,"book":{"id":1724,"title":"The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1) \n Biron Farrell was young and naïve, but he was growing up fast.
