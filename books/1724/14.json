{"id":68522,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The tableau remained unbroken for a moment. The Autarch had lit another cigarette. He was quite relaxed, his face untroubled. Gillbret had folded into the pilot\u0027s seat, his face screwed up as though he were going to burst into tears. The limp straps of the pilot\u0027s stress-absorbing outfit dangled about him and increased the lugubrious effect.\\n\\n Biron, paper-white, fists clenched, faced the Autarch. Artemisia, her thin nostrils flaring, kept her eyes not on the Autarch, but on Biron only.\\n\\n The radio signaled, the soft clickings crashing with the effect of cymbals in the small pilot room.\\n\\n Gillbret jerked upright, then whirled on the seat.\\n\\n The Autarch said lazily, \"I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ve been more talkative than I\u0027d anticipated. I told Rizzett to come get me if I had not returned in an hour.\"\\n\\n The visual screen was alive now with Rizzett\u0027s grizzled head.\\n\\n And then Gillbret said to the Autarch, \"He would like to speak to you.\" He made room.\\n\\n The Autarch rose from his chair and advanced so that his own head was within the zone of visual transmission.\\n\\n He said, \"I am perfectly safe, Rizzett.\"\\n\\n The other\u0027s question was heard clearly: \"Who are the crew members on the cruiser, sir?\"\\n\\n And suddenly Biron stood next to the Autarch. \"I am Rancher of Widemos,\" he said proudly.\\n\\n Rizzett smiled gladly and broadly. A hand appeared on the screen in sharp salute. \"Greetings, sir.\"\\n\\n The Autarch interrupted. \"I will be returning soon with a young lady. Prepare to maneuver for contact air locks.\" And he broke the visual connection between the two ships.\\n\\n He turned to Biron.\"I assured them it was you on board ship. There was some objection to my coming here alone otherwise. Your father was extremely popular with my men.\"\\n\\n \"Which is why you can use my name.\"\\n\\n The Autarch shrugged.\\n\\n Biron said, \"It is all you can use. Your last statement to your officer was inaccurate.\"\\n\\n \"In what way?\"\\n\\n \"Artemisia oth Hinriad stays with me.\"\\n\\n \"Still? After what I have told you?\"\\n\\n Biron said sharply, \"You have told me nothing. You have made a bare statement, but I am not likely to take your unsupported word for anything. I tell you this without any attempt at tact. I hope you understand me.\"\\n\\n \"Is your knowledge of Hinrik such that my statement seems inherently implausible to you?\"\\n\\n Biron was staggered. Visibly and apparently, the remark had struck home. He made no answer.\\n\\n Artemisia said, \"I say it\u0027s not so. Do you have proof?\"\\n\\n \"No direct proof, of course. I was not present at any conferences between your father and the Tyranni. But I can present certain known facts and allow you to make your own inferences. First, the old Rancher of Widemos visited Hinrik six months ago. I\u0027ve said that already. I can add here that he was somewhat overenthusiastic in his efforts, or perhaps he overestimated Hinrik\u0027s discretion. At any rate, he talked more than he should have. My Lord Gillbret can verify that.\"\\n\\n Gillbret nodded miserably. He turned to Artemisia, who had turned to him with moist and angry eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry, Arta, but it\u0027s true. I\u0027ve told you this. It was from Widemos that I heard about the Autarch.\"\\n\\n The Autarch said, \"And it was fortunate for myself that my lord had developed such long mechanical ears with which to sate his lively curiosity concerning the Director\u0027s meetings of state. I was warned of the danger, quite unwittingly, by Gillbret when he first approached me. I left as soon as I could, but the damage, of course, had been done.\\n\\n \"Now, to our knowledge, it was Widemos\u0027s only slip, and Hinrik, certainly, has no enviable reputation as a man of any great independence and courage. Your father, Farrill, was arrested within half a year. If not through Hinrik, through this girl\u0027s father, then how?\"\\n\\n Biron said, \"You did not warn him?\"\\n\\n \"In our business we take our chances, Farrill, but he was warned. After that he made no contact, however indirect, with any of us, and destroyed whatever proof he had of connection with us. Some among us believed that he should leave the Sector, or, at the very least, go into hiding. He refused to do this.\\n\\n \"I think I can understand why. To alter his way of life would prove the truth of what the Tyranni must have learned, endanger the entire movement. He decided to risk his own life only. He remained in the open.\\n\\n \"For nearly half a year the Tyranni waited for a betraying gesture. They are patient, the Tyranni. None came, so that when they could wait no longer, they found nothing in their net but him.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a lie,\" cried Artemisia. \"It\u0027s all a lie. It\u0027s a smug, sanctimonious, lying story with no truth in it. If all you said were true, they would be watching you too. You would be in danger yourself. You wouldn\u0027t be sitting here, smiling and wasting time.\"\\n\\n \"My lady, I do not waste my time. I have already tried to do what I could toward discrediting your father as a source of information. I think I have succeeded somewhat. The Tyranni will wonder if they ought to listen further to a man whose daughter and cousin are obvious traitors. And then again, if they are still disposed to believe him, why, I am on the point of vanishing into the Nebula where they will not find me. I should think my actions tend to prove my story rather than otherwise.\"\\n\\n Biron drew a deep breath and said, \"Let us consider the interview at an end, Jonti. We have agreed to the extent that we will accompany you and that you will grant us needed supplies. That is enough. Granting that all you have just said is truth, it is still beside the point. The crimes of the Director of Rhodia are not inherited by his daughter. Artemisia oth Hinriad stays here with me, provided she herself agrees.\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" said Artemisia.\\n\\n \"Good. I think that covers everything. I warn you, by the way. You are armed; so am I. Your ships are fighters, perhaps; mine is a Tyrannian cruiser.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be silly, Farrill. My intentions are quite friendly. You wish to keep the girl here? So be it. May I leave by contact air lock?\"\\n\\n Biron nodded. \"We will trust you so far.\"\\n\\n The two ships maneuvered ever closer, until the flexible airlock extensions pouted outward toward one another. Carefully, they edged about, trying for the perfect fit. Gillbret hung upon the radio.\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll be trying for contact again in two minutes,\" he said.\\n\\n Three times already the magnetic field had been triggered, and each time the extending tubes had stretched toward one another and met off-center, gaping crescents of space between them.\\n\\n \"Two minutes,\" repeated Biron, and waited tensely.\\n\\n The second hand moved and the magnetic field clicked into existence a fourth time, the lights dimming as the motors adjusted to the sudden drain of power. Again the airlock extensions reached out, hovered on the brink of instability, and then, with a noiseless jar, the vibration of which hummed its way into the pilot room, settled into place properly, clamps automatically locking in position. An air-tight seal had been formed.\\n\\n Biron drew the back of his hand slowly across his forehead and some of the tension oozed out of him.\\n\\n \"There it is,\" he said.\\n\\n The Autarch lifted his space suit. There was still a thin film of moisture under it.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" he said pleasantly. \"An officer of mine will be right back. You will arrange the details of the supplies necessary with him.\"\\n\\n The Autarch left.\\n\\n Biron said, \"Take care of Jonti\u0027s officer for me for a while, will you, Oil. When he comes in, break the air-lock contact. All you\u0027ll have to do is remove the magnetic field. This is the photonic switch you\u0027ll flash.\"\\n\\n He turned and stepped out of the pilot room. Right now he needed time for himself. Time to think, mostly.\\n\\n But there was the hurried footstep behind him, and the soft voice. He stopped.\\n\\n \"Biron,\" said Artemisia, \"I want to speak to you. \" He faced her. \"Later, if you don\u0027t mind, Arta.\"\\n\\n She was looking up at him intently. \"No, now.\"\\n\\n Her arms were poised as though she would have liked to embrace him but was not sure of her reception. She said, \"You didn\u0027t believe what he said about my father?\"\\n\\n \"It has no bearing,\" said Biron. \"Biron,\" she began, and stopped. It was hard for her to say it. She tried again, \"Biron, I know that part of what has been going on between us has been because we\u0027ve been alone and together and in danger, but-\" She stopped again.\\n\\n Biron said, \"If you\u0027re trying to say you\u0027re a Hinriad, Arta, there\u0027s no need. I know it. I won\u0027t hold you to anything afterward.\"\\n\\n \"No. Oh no.\" She caught his arm and placed her cheek against his hard shoulder. She was speaking rapidly. \"That\u0027s not it at all. It doesn\u0027t matter about Hinriad and Widemos at all. I-I love you, Biron.\"\\n\\n Her eyes went up, meeting his. \"I think you love me too. I think you would admit it if you could forget that I am a Hinriad. Maybe you will now that I\u0027ve said it first. You told the Autarch you would not hold my father\u0027s deeds against me. Don\u0027t hold his rank against me, either.\"\\n\\n Her arms were around his neck now. Biron could feel the softness of her breasts against him and the warmth of her breath on his lips. Slowly his own hands went upward and gently grasped her forearms. As gently, he disengaged her arms and, still as gently, stepped back from her.\\n\\n He said, \"I am not quits with the Hinriads, my lady.\"\\n\\n She was startled. \"You told the Autarch that-\"\\n\\n He looked away. \"Sorry, Arta. Don\u0027t go by what I told the Autarch.\"\\n\\n She wanted to cry out that it wasn\u0027t true, that her father had not done this thing, that in any case-\\n\\n But he turned into the cabin and left her standing in the corridor, her eyes filling with hurt and shame. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-like-dust-galactic-empire-1/page-14.html","bookId":1724,"book":{"id":1724,"title":"The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1)","description":"Storyline: The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1) \\n Biron Farrell was young and naïve, but he was growing up fast.
