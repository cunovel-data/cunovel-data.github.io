{"id":68523,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Tedor Rizzett turned as Biron entered the pilot room again. His hair was gray, but his body was still vigorous and his face was broad, red, and smiling.\n He covered the distance between himself and Biron in a stride and seized the young man\u0027s hand heartily.\n \"By the stars,\" he said, \"I\u0027d need no word from you to tell me that you are your father\u0027s son. It is the old Rancher alive again.\"\n \"I wish it were,\" said Biron, somberly.\n Rizzett\u0027s smile faltered. \"So do we all. Every one of us. I\u0027m Tedor Rizzett, by the way. I\u0027m a colonel in the regular Linganian forces, but we don\u0027t use titles in our own little game. We even say \u0027sir\u0027 to the Autarch. That reminds me!\" He looked grave. \"We don\u0027t have lords and ladies or even Ranchers on Lingane. I hope I won\u0027t offend if I forget to throw in the proper title sometimes.\"\n Biron shrugged.\" As you said, no titles in our little game. But what about the trailer? I\u0027m to make arrangements with you, I take it.\"\n For a flickering moment he looked across the room. Gillbret was seated, quietly listening. Artemisia had her back to him. Her slim, pale fingers wove an abstracted pattern on the photocontacts of the computer. Rizzett\u0027s voice brought him back.\n The Linganian had cast an all-inclusive glance about the room. \"First time I\u0027ve ever seen a Tyrannian vessel from the inside. Don\u0027t care much for it. Now you\u0027ve got the emergency air lock due stern, haven\u0027t you? It seems to me the power thrusters girdle the midsection.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"Good. Then there won\u0027t be any trouble. Some of the old model ships had power thrusters due stern, so that trailers had to be set off at an angle. This makes the gravity adjustment difficult and the maneuverability in atmospheres just about nil.\"\n \"How long will it take, Rizzett?\"\n \"Not long. How big would you want it?\"\n \"How big could you get it?\"\n \"Super deluxe? Sure. If the Autarch says so, there\u0027s no higher priority. We can get one that\u0027s practically a space ship in itself. It would even have auxiliary motors.\"\n \"It would have living quarters, I suppose.\"\n \"For Miss Hinriad? It would be considerably better than you have here-\" He stopped abruptly.\n At the mention of her name, Artemisia had drifted past coldly and slowly, moving out of the pilot room. Biron\u0027s eyes followed her.\n Rizzett said, \"I shouldn\u0027t have said Miss Hinriad, I suppose.\"\n \"No, no. It\u0027s nothing. Pay no attention. You were saying?\"\n \"Oh, about the rooms. At least two sizable ones, with a communicating shower. It\u0027s got the usual closet room and plumbing arrangements of the big liners. She would be comfortable.\"\n \"Good. We\u0027ll need food and water.\"\n \"Sure. Water tank will hold a two months\u0027 supply; a little less if you want to arrange for a swimming pool aboard ship. And you would have frozen whole meats. You\u0027re eating Tyrannian concentrate now, aren\u0027t you?\"\n Biron nodded and Rizzett grimaced.\n \"It tastes like chopped sawdust, doesn\u0027t it? What else?\"\n \"A supply of clothes for the lady,\" said Biron.\n Rizzett wrinkled his forehead. \"Yes, of course. Well, that will be her job.\"\n \"No, sir, it won\u0027t. We\u0027ll supply you with all the necessary measurements and you can supply us with whatever we ask for in whatever the current styles happen to be.\"\n Rizzett laughed shortly and shook his head. \"Rancher, she won\u0027t like that. She wouldn\u0027t be satisfied with any clothes she didn\u0027t pi\"k. Not even if they were the identical items she would have picked if she had been given the chance. This isn\u0027t a guess, now. I\u0027ve had experience with the creatures.\"\n Biron said, \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re right, Rizzett. But that\u0027s the way it will have to be.\"\n \"All right, but I\u0027ve warned you. It will be your argument. What else?\"\n \"Little things. Little things. A supply of detergents. Oh yes, cosmetics, perfume-the things women need. We\u0027ll make the arrangements in time. Let\u0027s get the trailer started.\"\n And now Gillbret was leaving without speaking. Biron\u0027s eyes followed him, too, and he felt his jaw muscles tighten. Hinriads! They were Hinriads! There was nothing he could do about it. They were Hinriads! Gillbret was one and she was another.\n He said, \"And, of course, there\u0027ll be clothes for Mr. Hinriad and myself. That won\u0027t be very important.\"\n \"Right. Mind if I use your radio? I\u0027d better stay on this ship till the adjustments are made.\"\n Biron waited while the initial orders went out. Then Rizzett turned on the seat and said, \"I can\u0027t get used to seeing you here, moving, talking, alive. You\u0027re so like him. The Rancher used to speak about you every once in a while. You went to school on Earth, didn\u0027t you?\"\n \"I did. I would have graduated a little over a week ago, if things hadn\u0027t been interrupted.\"\n Rizzett looked uncomfortable. \"Look, about your being sent to Rhodia the way you were. You mustn\u0027t hold it against us. We didn\u0027t like it. I mean, this is strictly between us, but some of the boys didn\u0027t like it at all. The Autarch didn\u0027t consult us, of course. Naturally, he wouldn\u0027t. Frankly, it was a risk on his part. Some of us-I\u0027m not mentioning names-even wondered if we shouldn\u0027t stop the liner you were on and pull you off. Naturally that would have been the worst thing we could possibly have done. Still, we might have done it, except that in the last analysis, we knew that the Autarch must have known what he was doing.\"\n \"It\u0027s nice to be able to inspire that kind of confidence.\"\n \"We know him. There\u0027s no denying it. He\u0027s got it here.\" A finger slowly tapped his forehead. \"Nobody knows exactly what makes him take a certain course sometimes. But it always seems the right one. At least he\u0027s outsmarted the Tyranni so far and others don\u0027t.\"\n \"Like my father, for instance.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t thinking of him, exactly, but in a sense, you\u0027re right. Even the Rancher was caught. But then he was a different kind of man. His way of thinking was straight. He would never allow for crookedness. He would always underestimate the worthlessness of the next man. But then again, that was what we liked best, somehow. He was the same to everyone, you know.\n \"I\u0027m a commoner for all I\u0027m a colonel. My father was a metalworker, you see. It didn\u0027t make any difference to him. And it wasn\u0027t that I was a colonel, either. If he met the engineer\u0027s \u0027prentice walking down the corridor, he\u0027d step aside and say a pleasant word or two, and for the rest of the day, the \u0027prentice would feel like a master engineman. It was the way he had.\n \"Not that he was soft. If you needed disciplining, you got it, but no more than your share. What you got, you deserved, and you knew it. When he was through, he was through. He didn\u0027t keep throwing it at you at odd moments for a week or so. That was the Rancher.\n \"Now the Autarch, he\u0027s different. He\u0027s just brains. You can\u0027t get next to him, no matter who you are. For instance. He doesn\u0027t really have a sense of humor. I can\u0027t speak to him the way I\u0027m speaking to you right now. Right now, I\u0027m just talking. I\u0027m relaxed. It\u0027s almost free association. With him, you say exactly what\u0027s on your mind with no spare words. And you use formal phraseology, or he\u0027ll tell you you\u0027re slovenly. But then, the Autarch\u0027s the Autarch, and that\u0027s that.\"\n Biron said, \"I\u0027ll have to agree with you as far as the Autarch\u0027s brains are concerned. Did you know that he had deduced my presence aboard this ship before he ever got on?\"\n \"He did? We didn\u0027t know that. Now, there, that\u0027s what I mean. He was going to go aboard the Tyrannian cruiser alone. To us, it seemed suicide. We didn\u0027t like it. But we assumed he knew what he was doing, and he did. He could have told us you were probably aboard ship. He must have known it would be great news that the Rancher\u0027s son had escaped. But it\u0027s typical. He wouldn\u0027t.\"\n Artemisia sat on one of the lower bunks in the cabin. She had to bend into an uncomfortable position to avoid having the frame of the second bunk pry into her first thoracic vertebra, but that was a small item to her at the moment.\n Almost automatically, she kept passing the palms of her hands down the side of her dress. She felt frayed and dirty, and very tired.\n She was tired of dabbing at her hands and face with damp napkins. She was tired of wearing the same clothes for a week. She was tired of hair which seemed dank and stringy by now.\n And then she was almost on her feet again, ready to turn about sharply; she wasn\u0027t going to see him; she wouldn\u0027t look at him.\n But it was only Gillbret. She sank down again. \"Hello, Uncle Oil.\"\n Gillbret sat down opposite her. For a moment his thin face seemed anxious and then it started wrinkling into a smile. \"I think a week of this ship is very unamusing too. I was hoping you could cheer me up.\"\n But she said, \"Now, Uncle Oil, don\u0027t start using psychology on me. If you think you\u0027re going to cajole me into feeling a responsibility for you, you\u0027re wrong. I\u0027m much more likely to hit you.\"\n \"If it will make you feel better-\"\n \"I warn you again. If you hold out your arm for me to hit, I\u0027ll do it, and if you say \u0027Does that make you feel better?\u0027 I\u0027ll do it again.\"\n \"In any case, it\u0027s obvious you\u0027ve quarreled with Biron. What about?\"\n \"I don\u0027t see why there\u0027s any necessity for discussion. Just leave me alone.\" Then, after a pause, \"He thinks Father did what the Autarch said he did. I hate him for that.\"\n \"Your father?\"\n \"No! That stupid, childish, sanctimonious fool!\"\n \"Presumably Biron. Good. You hate him. You couldn\u0027t put a knife edge between the kind of hate that has you sitting here like this and something that would seem to my own bachelor mind to be a rather ridiculous excess of love.\"\n \"Uncle oil,\" she said, \"could he really have done it?\"\n \"Biron? Done what?\"\n \"No! Father. Could Father have done it? Could he have informed against the Rancher?\"\n Gillbret looked thoughtful and very sober. \"I don\u0027t know.\" He looked at her out of the corner of his eyes. \"You know, he did give Biron up to the Tyranni.\"\n \"Because he knew it was a trap,\" she said vehemently. \"And it was. That horrible Autarch meant it as such. He said so. The Tyranni knew who Biron was and sent him to Father on purpose. Father did the only thing he could do. That should be obvious to anybody.\"\n \"Even if we accept that\"-and again that sideways look -\"he did try to argue you into a rather unamusing kind of marriage. If Hinrik could bring himself to do that-\"\n She interrupted. \"He had no way out there, either.\"\n \"My dear, if you\u0027re going to excuse every act of subservience to the Tyranni as something he had to do, why, then, how do you know he didn\u0027t have to hint something about the Rancher to the Tyranni?\"\n \"Because I\u0027m sure he wouldn\u0027t. You don\u0027t know Father the way I do. He hates the Tyranni. He does. I know it. He wouldn\u0027t go out of his way to help them. I admit that he\u0027s afraid of them and doesn\u0027t dare oppose them openly, but if he could avoid it somehow, he would never help them.\",\n \"How do you know he could avoid it?\"\n But she shook her head violently, so that her hair tumbled about and hid her eyes. It hid the tears a bit too.\n Gillbret watched a moment, then spread his hands helplessly and left.\n The trailer was joined to the Remorseless by a waspwaist corridor attached to the emergency air lock in the rear of the ship. It was several dozen times larger than the Tyranni vessel in capacity, almost humorously outsized.\n The Autarch joined Biron in a last inspection. He said, \"Do you find anything lacking?\"\n Biron said, \"No. I think we\u0027ll be quite comfortable.\"\n \"Good. And by the way, Rizzett tells me the Lady Artemisia is not well, or at least that she looks unwell. If she requires medical attention, it might be wise to send her to my ship.\"\n \"She is quite well,\" said Biron curtly.\n \"If you say so. Would you be ready to leave in twelve hours?\"\n \"In two hours, if you wish.\"\n Biron passed through the connecting corridor (he had to stoop a little) into the Remorseless proper.\n He said with a careful evenness of tone, \"You\u0027ve got a private suite back there, Artemisia. I won\u0027t bother you. I\u0027ll stay here most of the time.\"\n And she replied coldly, \"You don\u0027t bother me, Rancher. It doesn\u0027t matter to me where you are.\"\n And then the ships blasted off, and after a single Jump they found themselves at the edge of the Nebula. They waited for a few hours while the final calculations were made on Jonti\u0027s ship. Inside the Nebula it would be almost blind navigation.\n Biron stared glumly at the visiplate. There was nothing there! One entire half of the celestial sphere was taken up with blackness, unrelieved by a spark of light. For the first time, Biron realized how warm and friendly the stars were, how they filled space.\n \"It\u0027s like dropping through a hole in space,\" he muttered to Gillbret.\n And then they Jumped again, into the Nebula.\n Almost simultaneously Simok Aratap, Commissioner of the Great Khan, at the head of ten armed cruisers, listened to his navigator and said, \"That doesn\u0027t matter. Follow them anyway.\"\n And not one light-year from the point at which the Remorseless entered the Nebula, ten Tyranni vessels did likewise. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-like-dust-galactic-empire-1/page-15.html","bookId":1724,"book":{"id":1724,"title":"The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1) \n Biron Farrell was young and naïve, but he was growing up fast.
