{"id":68514,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Biron Farrill waited uneasily in one of the outer buildings on the Palace Grounds. For the first time in his life he experienced the deflating sensation of being a provincial. Widemos Hall, where he had grown up, had been beautiful in his eyes, and now his memory endowed it with merely barbaric glitter. Its curved lines, its filigree work, its curiously wrought turrets, its elaborate \"false windows\"-He winced at the thought of them. But this-this was different. The Palace Grounds of Rhodia were no mere lump of\u0027 ostentation built by the petty lords of a cattle kingdom; nor were they the childlike expression of a fading and dying world. They were the culmination, in stone, of the Hinriad dynasty. The buildings were strong and quiet. Their lines were straight and vertical, lengthening toward the center of each structure, yet avoiding anything as effeminate as a spire effect. They held a bluntness about them, yet lifted into a climax that affected the onlooker without revealing their method of doing so at a casual glance. They were reserved, self-contained, proud. And as each building was, so was the group as a whole, the huge Palace Central becoming a crescendo. One by one, even the few artificialities remaining in the masculine Rhodian style had dropped away. The very \"false windows,\" so valued as decoration and so useless in a building of artificial light and ventilation, were done away with. And that, somehow, without loss. It was only line and plane, a geometrical abstraction that led the eye upward to the sky. The Tyrannian major stopped briefly at his side as he left the inner room. \"You will be received now,\" he said. Biron nodded, and after a while a larger man in a uniform of scarlet and tan clicked heels before him. It struck Biron with sudden force that those who had the real power did not need the outward show and could be satisfied with slate blue. He recalled the splendid formality of a Rancher\u0027s life and bit his lip at the thought of its futility. \"Biron Malaine?\" asked the Rhodian guard, and Biron rose to follow. There was a little gleaming monorail carriage that was suspended delicately by diamagnetic forces upon a single ruddy shaft of metal. Biron had never seen one before. He paused before entering. The little carriage, big enough for five or six at the most, swayed with the wind, a graceful teardrop returning the gleam of Rhodia\u0027s splendid sun. The single rail was slender, scarcely more than a cable, and ran the length of the carriage\u0027s underside without touching. Biron bent and saw blue sky all the length between them. For a moment, as he watched, a lifting gust of wind raised it, so that it hovered a full inch above the rail, as though impatient for flight and tearing at the invisible force field that held it. Then it fluttered back to the rail, closer and still closer, but never touching. \"Get in,\" said the guard behind him impatiently, and Biron climbed two steps into the carriage. The steps remained long enough for the guard to follow, then lifted quietly and smoothly into place, forming no break in the carriage\u0027s even exterior. Biron became aware that the outer opacity of the carriage was an illusion. Once within, he found himself sitting in a transparent bubble. At the motion of a small control, the carriage lifted upward. It climbed the heights easily, buffeting the atmosphere which whistled past. For one moment, Biron caught the panorama of the Palace Grounds from the apex of the arc. The structures became a gorgeous whole (could they -have been originally conceived other than as an air view?), laced by the shining copper threads, along one or two of which the graceful carriage bubbles skimmed. He felt himself pressed forward, and the carriage came to a dancing halt. The entire run had lasted less than two minutes. A door stood open before him. He entered and it closed behind him. There was no one in the room, which was small and bare. For the moment, no one was pushing him, but he felt no comfort because of it. He was under no illusions. Ever since that damned night, others had forced his moves. Jonti had placed him on the ship. The Tyrannian Commissioner had placed him here. And each move had increased the measure of his desperation. It was obvious to Biron that the Tyrannian had not been fooled. It had been too easy to get away from him. The Commissioner might have called the Terrestrial Consul. He might have hyper-waved Earth, or taken his retinal patterns. These things were routine; they could not have been omitted accidentally. He remembered Jonti\u0027s analysis of affairs. Some of it might still be valid. The Tyranni would not kill him outright to create another martyr. But Hinrik was their puppet, and he was as capable as they of ordering an execution. And then he would have been killed by one of his own, and the Tyranni would merely be disdainful onlookers. Biron clenched his fists tightly. He was tall and strong, but he was unarmed. The men who would come for him would have blasters and neuronic whips. He found himself backing against the wall. He whirled quickly at the small sound of the opening door to his left. The man who entered was armed and uniformed but there was a girl with him. He relaxed a bit. It was only a girl with him. At another time he might have observed the girl closely, since she was worth observation and approval, but at the moment she was only a girl. They approached together, stopping some six feet away. He kept his eye on the guard\u0027s blaster. The girl said to the guard, \"I\u0027ll speak to him first, Lieutenant.\" There was a little vertical line between her eyes as she turned to him. She said, \"Are you the man who has this story of an assassination plot against the Director?\" Biron said, \"I was told I would see the Director.\" \"That is impossible. If you have anything to say, say it to me. If your information is truthful and useful, you will be well treated.\" \"May I ask you who you are? How do I know you are authorized to speak for the Director?\" The girl seemed annoyed. \"I am his daughter. Please answer my questions. Are you from outside the System?\" \"I am from Earth.\" Biron paused, then added, \"Your Grace.\" The addition pleased her. \"Where is that?\" \"It is a small planet of the Sirian Sector, Your Grace.\" \"And what is your name?\" \"Biron Malaine, Your Grace.\" She stared at him thoughtfully. \"From Earth? Can you pilot a space ship?\" Biron almost smiled. She was testing him. She knew very well that space navigation was one of the forbidden sciences in the Tyranni-controlled worlds. He said, \"Yes, Your Grace.\" He could prove that when the performance test came, if they let him live that long. Space navigation was not a forbidden science en Earth, and in four years one could learn much. She said, \"Very well. And your story?\" He made his decision suddenly. To the guard alone, he would not have dared. But this was a girl, and if she were not lying, if she really were the Director\u0027s daughter, she might be a persuasive factor on his behalf. He said, \"There is no assassination plot, Your Grace.\" The girl was startled. She turned impatiently to her companion. \"Would you take over, Lieutenant? Get the truth out of him.\" Biron took a step forward and met the cold thrust of the guard\u0027s blaster. He said urgently, \"Wait, Your Grace. Listen to me! It was the only way to see the Director. Don\u0027t you understand?\" He raised his voice and sent it after her retreating form. \"Will you tell His Excellency, at least, that I am Biron Farrill and claim my sanctuary right?\" It was a feeble straw at which to clutch. The old feudal customs had been losing their force with the generations even before the Tyranni came. Now they were archaisms. But there was nothing else. Nothing. She turned, and her eyebrows were arched. \"Are you claiming now to be of the aristocratic order? A moment ago your name was Malaine.\" A new voice sounded unexpectedly. \"So it was, but it is the second name which is correct. You are Biron Farrill indeed, my good sir. Of course you are. The resemblance is unmistakable.\". A small, smiling man stood in the doorway. His eyes, widely spaced and brilliant, were taking in all of Biron with an amused sharpness. He cocked his narrow face upward at Biron\u0027s height and said to the girl, \"Don\u0027t you recognize him, too, Artemisia?\" Artemisia hurried to him, her voice troubled. \"Uncle Oil, What are you doing here?\" \"Taking care of my interests, Artemisia. Remember that if there were an assassination, I would be the closest of the Hinriads to the possible succession.\" Gillbret oth Hinriad winked elaborately, then added, \"Oh, get the lieutenant out of here. There isn\u0027t any danger.\" She ignored that and said, \"Have you been sounding the communicator again?\" \"But yes. Would you deprive me of an amusement? It is pleasant to eavesdrop on them.\" \"Not if they catch you.\" \"The danger is part of the game, my dear. The amusing part. After all, the Tyranni do not hesitate to sound the.Palace. We can\u0027t do much without their knowing. Well, turnabout, you know. Aren\u0027t you going to introduce me?\" \"No, I\u0027m not,\" she said shortly. \"This is none of your business.\" \"Then I\u0027ll introduce you. When I heard his name, I stopped listening and came in.\" He moved past Artemisia, stepped up to Biron, inspected him with an impersonal smile, and said, \"This, is Biron Farrill.\" \"I have said so myself,\" said Biron. More than half his attention was upon the lieutenant, who still held his blaster in firing position. \"But you have not added that you are the son of the Rancher of Widemos.\" \"I would have but for your interruption. In any case, you\u0027ve got the story now. Obviously, I had to get away from the Tyranni, and that without giving them my real name.\" Biron waited. This was it, he felt. If the next move was not an immediate arrest, there was still a trifling chance. Artemisia said, \"I see. This is a matter for the Director. You are sure there is no plot of any sort, then.\" \"None, Your Grace.\" \"Good. Uncle Gil, will you remain with Mr. Farrill? Lieutenant, will you come with me?\" Biron felt weak. He would have liked to sit down, but no suggestion to that effect was made by Gillbret, who still inspected him with an almost clinical interest. \"The Rancher\u0027s son! Amusing!\" Biron brought his attention downward. He was tired of cautious monosyllables and careful phrases. He said abruptly, \"Yes, the Rancher\u0027s son. It is a congenital situation. Can I help you in any other way?\" Gillbret showed no offense. His thin face merely creased further as his smile widened. He said, \"You might satisfy my curiosity. You really came for Sanctuary? Here?\" \"I\u0027d rather discuss that with the Director, sir.\" \"Oh, get off it, young man. You\u0027ll find that very little business can be done with the Director. Why do you suppose you had to deal with his daughter just now? That\u0027s an amusing thought, if you\u0027ll consider it.\" \"Do you find everything amusing?\" \"Why not? As an attitude toward life, it\u0027s an amusing one. It\u0027s the only adjective that will fit. Observe the universe, young man. If you can\u0027t force amusement out of it, you might as well cut your throat, since there\u0027s damned little good in it. I haven\u0027t introduced myself, by the way. I\u0027m the Director\u0027s cousin.\" Biron said coldly, \"Congratulations!\" Gillbret shrugged. \"You\u0027re right. It\u0027s not impressive. And I\u0027m likely to remain just that indefinitely since there is no assassination to be expected after all.\" \"Unless you whip one up for yourself.\" \"My dear sir, your sense of humor! You\u0027ll have to get used to the fact that nobody takes me seriously. My remark was only an expression of cynicism. You don\u0027t suppose the Directorship is worth anything these days, do you? Surely you cannot believe that Hinrik was always like this? He was never a great brain, but with every year he becomes more impossible. I forget! You haven\u0027t seen him yet. But you will! I hear him coming. When he speaks to you, remember that he is the ruler of the largest of the Trans-Nebular Kingdoms. It will be an amusing thought.\" Hinrik bore his dignity with the ease of experience. He acknowledged Biron\u0027s painstakingly ceremonious bow with the proper degree of condescension. He said, with a trace of abruptness, \"And your business with us, sir?\" Artemisia was standing at her father\u0027s side, and Biron noticed, with some surprise, that she was quite pretty. He said, \"Your Excellency, I have come on behalf of my father\u0027s good name. You must know his execution was unjust.\" Hinrik looked away. \"I knew your father slightly. He was in Rhodia once or twice.\" He paused, and his voice quavered a bit. \"You are very like him. Very. But he was tried, you know. At least I imagine he was. And according to law. Really, I don\u0027t know the details.\" \"Exactly, Your Excellency. But I would like to learn those details. I am sure that my father was no traitor.\" Hinrik broke in hurriedly. \"As his son, of course, it is understandable that you should defend your father, but, really, it is difficult to discuss such matters of state now. Highly irregular, in fact. Why don\u0027t you see Aratap?\" \"I do not know him, Excellency.\" \"Aratap! The Commissioner! The Tyrannian Commissioner\"\u0027 \"I have seen him and he sent me here. Surely, you understand that I dare not let the Tyranni-\" But Hinrik had grown stiff. His hand had wandered to his lips, as though to keep them from trembling, and his words were consequently muffled. \"Aratap sent you here, you say?\" \"I found it necessary to tell him-\" \"Don\u0027t repeat what you told him. I know,\" said Hinrik. \"I can do nothing for you, Rancher-uh-Mr. Farrill. It is not in my jurisdiction alone. The Executive Council-stop pulling at me, Arta. How can I pay attention to matters when you distract me?-must be consulted. Gillbret! Will you see that Mr. Farrill is taken care of? I will see what can be done. Yes, I will consult the Executive Council. The forms of law, you know. Very important. Very important.\" He turned on his heel, mumbling. Artemisia lingered for a moment and touched Biron\u0027s sleeve. \"A moment. Was it true, your statement that you could pilot a spaceship?\" \"Quite true,\" said Biron. He smiled at her, and after a moment\u0027s hesitation, she dimpled briefly in return. \"Gillbret,\" she said, \"I want to speak to you later.\" She hurried off. Biron looked after her till Gillbret tweaked at his sleeve. \"I presume you are hungry, perhaps thirsty, would like a wash?\" asked Gillbret. \"The ordinary amenities of life continue, I take it?\" \"Thank you, yes,\" said Biron. The tension had almost entirely washed out of him. For a moment he was relaxed and felt wonderful. She was pretty. Very pretty. But Hinrik was not relaxed; In his own chambers his thoughts whirled at a feverish pace. Try as he might, he could not wriggle out of the inevitable conclusion. It was a trap! Aratap had sent him and it was a trap! He buried his head in his hands to quiet and deaden the pounding, and then he knew what he had to do.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-like-dust-galactic-empire-1/page-6.html","bookId":1724,"book":{"id":1724,"title":"The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1)","description":"Storyline: The Stars, Like Dust (Galactic Empire #1) Biron Farrell was young and naïve, but he was growing up fast.
