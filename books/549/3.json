{"id":33132,"no":3,"title":"AUNT FOUNTAIN\u0027S PRISONER","content":"It is curious how the smallest incident, the most unimportant circumstance, will recall old friends and old associations. An old gentleman, who is noted far and near for his prodigious memory of dates and events, once told me that his memory, so astonishing to his friends and acquaintances, consisted not so much in remembering names and dates and facts, as in associating each of these with some special group of facts and events; so that he always had at command a series of associations to which he could refer instantly and confidently. This is an explanation of the system of employing facts, but not of the method by which they are accumulated and stored away. I was reminded of this some years ago by a paragraph in one of the county newspapers that sometimes come under my observation. It was[99] a very commonplace paragraph; indeed, it was in the nature of an advertisement—an announcement of the fact that orders for \"gilt-edged butter\" from the Jersey farm on the Tomlinson Place should be left at the drugstore in Rockville, where the first that came would be the first served. This businesslike notice was signed by Ferris Trunion. The name was not only peculiar, but new to me; but this was of no importance at all. The fact that struck me was the bald and bold announcement that the Tomlinson Place was the site and centre of trading and other commercial transactions in butter. I can only imagine what effect this announcement would have had on my grandmother, who died years ago, and on some other old people I used to know. Certainly they would have been horrified; and no wonder, for when they were in their prime the Tomlinson Place was the seat of all that was high, and mighty, and grand, in the social world in the neighborhood of Rockville. I remember that everybody stood in awe of the Tomlinsons. Just why this was so, I never could make out. They were very rich;[100] the Place embraced several thousand acres; but if the impressions made on me when a child are worth anything, they were extremely simple in their ways. Though, no doubt, they could be formal and conventional enough when occasion required. I have no distinct recollection of Judge Addison Tomlinson, except that he was a very tall old gentleman, much older than his wife, who went about the streets of Rockville carrying a tremendous gold-headed cane carved in a curious manner. In those days I knew more of Mrs. Tomlinson than I did of the judge, mainly because I heard a great deal more about her. Some of the women called her Mrs. Judge Tomlinson; but my grandmother never called her anything else but Harriet Bledsoe, which was her maiden name. It was a name, too, that seemed to suit her, so that when you once heard her called Harriet Bledsoe, you never forgot it afterward. I do not know now, any more than I did when a child, why this particular name should fit her so exactly; but, as I have been told, a lack of knowledge does not alter facts.[101] I think my grandmother used to go to church to see what kind of clothes Harriet Bledsoe wore; for I have often heard her say, after the sermon was over, that Harriet\u0027s bonnet, or Harriet\u0027s dress, was perfectly charming. Certainly Mrs. Tomlinson was always dressed in the height of fashion, though it was a very simple fashion when compared with the flounces and furbelows of her neighbors. I remember this distinctly, that she seemed to be perfectly cool the hottest Sunday in summer, and comfortably warm the coldest Sunday in winter; and I am convinced that this impression, made on the mind of a child, must bear some definite relation to Mrs. Tomlinson\u0027s good taste. Certainly my grandmother was never tired of telling me that Harriet Bledsoe was blessed with exceptionally good taste and fine manners; and I remember that she told me often how she wished I was a girl, so that I might one day be in a position to take advantage of the opportunities I had had of profiting by Harriet Bledsoe\u0027s example. I think there was some sort of attachment between my grandmother and Mrs.[102] Tomlinson, formed when they were at school together, though my grandmother was much the older of the two. But there was no intimacy. The gulf that money sometimes makes between those who have it and those who lack it lay between them. Though I think my grandmother was more sensitive about crossing this gulf than Mrs. Tomlinson. I was never in the Tomlinson house but once when a child. Whether it was because it was two or three miles away from Rockville, or whether it was because I stood in awe of my grandmother\u0027s Harriet Bledsoe, I do not know. But I have a very vivid recollection of the only time I went there as a boy. One of my play-mates, a rough-and-tumble little fellow, was sent by his mother, a poor sick woman, to ask Mrs. Tomlinson for some preserves. I think this woman and her little boy were in some way related to the Tomlinsons. The richest and most powerful people, I have heard it said, are not so rich and powerful but they are pestered by poor kin, and the Tomlinsons were no exception to the rule.[103] I went with this little boy I spoke of, and I was afraid afterward that I was in some way responsible for his boldness. He walked right into the presence of Mrs. Tomlinson, and, without waiting to return the lady\u0027s salutation, he said in a loud voice: \"Aunt Harriet, ma says send her some of your nicest preserves.\" \"Aunt Harriet, indeed!\" she exclaimed, and then she gave him a look that was cold enough to freeze him, and hard enough to send him through the floor. I think she relented a little, for she went to one of the windows, bigger than any door you see nowadays, and looked out over the blooming orchard; and then after a while she came back to us, and was very gracious. She patted me on the head; and I must have shrunk from her touch, for she laughed and said she never bit nice little boys. Then she asked me my name; and when I told her, she said my grandmother was the dearest woman in the world. Moreover, she told my companion that it would spoil preserves to carry them about in a tin bucket; and[104] then she fetched a big basket, and had it filled with preserves, and jelly, and cake. There were some ginger-preserves among the rest, and I remember that I appreciated them very highly; the more so, since my companion had a theory of his own that ginger-preserves and fruit-cake were not good for sick people. I remember, too, that Mrs. Tomlinson had a little daughter about my own age. She had long yellow hair and very black eyes. She rode around in the Tomlinson carriage a great deal, and everybody said she was remarkably pretty, with a style and a spirit all her own. The negroes used to say that she was as affectionate as she was wilful, which was saying a good deal. It was characteristic of Harriet Bledsoe, my grandmother said, that her little girl should be named Lady. I heard a great many of the facts I have stated from old Aunt Fountain, one of the Tomlinson negroes, who, for some reason or other, was permitted to sell ginger-cakes and persimmon-beer under the wide-spreading China trees in Rockville on public days and during court week.[105] There was a theory among certain envious people in Rockville—there are envious people everywhere—that the Tomlinsons, notwithstanding the extent of their landed estate and the number of their negroes, were sometimes short of ready cash; and it was hinted that they pocketed the proceeds of Aunt Fountain\u0027s persimmon-beer and ginger-cakes. Undoubtedly such stories as these were the outcome of pure envy. When my grandmother heard such gossip as this, she sighed, and said that people who would talk about Harriet Bledsoe in that way would talk about anybody under the sun. My own opinion is, that Aunt Fountain got the money and kept it; otherwise she would not have been so fond of her master and mistress, nor so proud of the family and its position. I spent many an hour near Aunt Fountain\u0027s cake and beer stand, for I liked to hear her talk. Besides, she had a very funny name, and I thought there was always a probability that she would explain how she got it. But she never did. I had forgotten all about the Tomlinsons until the advertisement I have mentioned was[106] accidentally brought to my notice, whereupon memory suddenly became wonderfully active. I am keenly alive to the happier results of the war, and I hope I appreciate at their full value the emancipation of both whites and blacks from the deadly effects of negro slavery, and the wonderful development of our material resources that the war has rendered possible; but I must confess it was with a feeling of regret that I learned that the Tomlinson Place had been turned into a dairy farm. Moreover, the name of Ferris Trunion had a foreign and an unfamiliar sound. His bluntly worded advertisement appeared to come from the mind of a man who would not hesitate to sweep away both romance and tradition if they happened to stand in the way of a profitable bargain. I was therefore much gratified, some time after reading Trunion\u0027s advertisement, to receive a note from a friend who deals in real estate, telling me that some land near the Tomlinson Place had been placed in his hands for sale, and asking me to go to Rockville to see if the land and the situation were all they were described[107] to be. I lost no time in undertaking this part of the business, for I was anxious to see how the old place looked in the hands of strangers, and unsympathetic strangers at that. It is not far from Atlanta to Rockville—a day and a night—and the journey is not fatiguing; so that a few hours after receiving my friend\u0027s request I was sitting in the veranda of the Rockville Hotel, observing, with some degree of wonder, the vast changes that had taken place—the most of them for the better. There were new faces and new enterprises all around me, and there was a bustle about the town that must have caused queer sensations in the minds of the few old citizens who still gathered at the post-office for the purpose of carrying on ancient political controversies with each other. Among the few familiar figures that attracted my attention was that of Aunt Fountain. The old China tree in the shade of which she used to sit had been blasted by lightning or fire; but she still had her stand there, and she was keeping the flies and dust away with the same old turkey-tail fan. I could see no change. If her[108] hair was grayer, it was covered and concealed from view by the snow-white handkerchief tied around her head. From my place I could hear her humming a tune—the tune I had heard her sing in precisely the same way years ago. I heard her scolding a little boy. The gesture, the voice, the words, were the same she had employed in trying to convince me that my room was much better than my company, especially in the neighborhood of her cake-stand. To see and hear her thus gave me a peculiar feeling of homesickness. I approached and saluted her. She bowed with old-fashioned politeness, but without looking up. \"De biggest uns, dee er ten cent,\" she said, pointing to her cakes; \"en de littlest, dee er fi\u0027 cent. I make um all myse\u0027f, suh. En de beer in dat jug—dat beer got body, suh.\" \"I have eaten many a one of your cakes, Aunt Fountain,\" said I, \"and drank many a glass of your beer; but you have forgotten me.\" \"My eye weak, suh, but dee ain\u0027 weak nuff fer dat.\" She shaded her eyes with her fan, and[109] looked at me. Then she rose briskly from her chair. \"De Lord he\u0027p my soul!\" she exclaimed enthusiastically. \"W\u0027y, I know you w\u0027en you little boy. W\u0027at make I ain\u0027 know you w\u0027en you big man? My eye weak, suh, but dee ain\u0027 weak nuff fer dat. Well, suh, you mus\u0027 eat some my ginger-cake. De Lord know you has make way wid um w\u0027en you wuz little boy.\" The invitation was accepted, but somehow the ginger-cakes had lost their old-time relish; in me the taste and spirit of youth were lacking. We talked of old times and old friends, and I told Aunt Fountain that I had come to Rockville for the purpose of visiting in the neighborhood of the Tomlinson Place. \"Den I gwine wid you, suh,\" she cried, shaking her head vigorously. \"I gwine wid you.\" And go she did. \"I been layin\u0027 off ter go see my young mistiss dis long time,\" said Aunt Fountain, the next day, after we had started. \"I glad I gwine deer in style. De niggers won\u0027 know me skacely, ridin\u0027 in de buggy dis away.\" \"Your young mistress?\" I inquired.[110] \"Yes, suh. You know Miss Lady w\u0027en she little gal. She grown \u0027oman now.\" \"Well, who is this Trunion I have heard of?\" \"He monst\u0027ous nice w\u0027ite man, suh. He married my young mistiss. He monst\u0027ous nice w\u0027ite man.\" \"But who is he? Where did he come from?\" Aunt Fountain chuckled convulsively as I asked these questions. \"We-all des pick \u0027im up, suh. Yes, suh; we-all des pick \u0027im up. Ain\u0027 you year talk \u0027bout dat, suh? I dunner whar you bin at ef you ain\u0027 never is year talk \u0027bout dat. He de fus\u0027 w\u0027ite man w\u0027at I ever pick up, suh. Yes, suh; de ve\u0027y fus\u0027 one.\" \"I don\u0027t understand you,\" said I; \"tell me about it.\" At this Aunt Fountain laughed long and loudly. She evidently enjoyed my ignorance keenly. \"De Lord know I oughtn\u0027 be laughin\u0027 like dis. I ain\u0027 laugh so hearty sence I wuz little gal mos\u0027, en dat wuz de time w\u0027en Marse Rowan Tomlinson come \u0027long en ax me my name. I[111] tell \u0027im, I did: \u0027I\u0027m name Flew Ellen, suh.\u0027 Marse Rowan he deaf ez any dead hoss. He \u0027low: \u0027Hey?\u0027 I say: \u0027I\u0027m name Flew Ellen, suh.\u0027 Marse Rowan say: \u0027Fountain! Huh! he quare name.\u0027 I holler en laugh, en w\u0027en de folks ax me w\u0027at I hollerin\u0027 \u0027bout, I tell um dat Marse Rowan say I\u0027m name Fountain. Well, suh, fum dat day down ter dis, stedder Flew Ellen, I\u0027m bin name Fountain. I laugh hearty den en my name got change, en I feared ef I laugh now de hoss\u0027ll run away en turn de buggy upperside down right spang on top er me.\" \"But about this Mr. Trunion?\" said I. \"Name er de Lord!\" exclaimed Aunt Fountain, \"ain\u0027 you never is bin year \u0027bout dat? You bin mighty fur ways, suh, kaze we all bin knowin\u0027 \u0027bout it fum de jump.\" \"No doubt. Now tell me about it.\" Aunt Fountain shook her head, and her face assumed a serious expression. \"I dunno \u0027bout dat, suh. I year tell dat niggers ain\u0027 got no business fer go talkin\u0027 \u0027bout fambly doin\u0027s. Yit dar wuz yo\u0027 gran-mammy. My mistiss sot lots by her, en you been bornded[112] right yer \u0027long wid um. I don\u0027t speck it\u0027ll be gwine so mighty fur out\u0027n de fambly ef I tell you \u0027bout it.\" I made no attempt to coax Aunt Fountain to tell me about Trunion, for I knew it would be difficult to bribe her not to talk about him. She waited a while, evidently to tease my curiosity; but as I betrayed none, and even made an effort to talk about something else, she began: \"Well, suh, you ax me \u0027bout Marse Fess Trunion. I know you bleeze ter like dat man. He ain\u0027 b\u0027long ter we-all folks, no furder dan he my young mistiss ole man, but dee ain\u0027 no finer w\u0027ite man dan him. No, suh; dee ain\u0027. I tell you dat p\u0027intedly. De niggers, dee say he mighty close en pinchin\u0027, but deze is mighty pinchin\u0027 times—you know dat yo\u0027se\u0027f, suh. Ef a man don\u0027 fa\u0027rly fling \u0027way he money, dem Tomlinson niggers, dee\u0027ll say he mighty pinchin\u0027. I hatter be pinchin\u0027 myse\u0027f, suh, kaze I know time I sell my ginger-cakes dat ef I don\u0027t grip onter de money, dee won\u0027 be none lef\u0027 fer buy flour en \u0027lasses fer make mo\u0027. It de Lord\u0027s trufe, suh, kaze I done had trouble dat way[113] many\u0027s de time. I say dis \u0027bout Marse Fess Trunion, ef he ain\u0027 got de blood, he got de breedin\u0027. Ef he ain\u0027 good ez de Tomlinsons, he lots better dan some folks w\u0027at I know.\" I gathered from all this that Trunion was a foreigner of some kind, but I found out my mistake later. \"I pick dat man up myse\u0027f, en I knows \u0027im \u0027most good ez ef he wuz one er we-all.\" \"What do you mean when you say you \u0027picked him up\u0027?\" I asked, unable to restrain my impatience. \"Well, suh, de fus\u0027 time I see Marse Fess Trunion wuz terreckerly atter de Sherman army come \u0027long. Dem wuz hot times, suh, col\u0027 ez de wedder wuz. Dee wuz in-about er million un um look like ter me, en dee des ravage de face er de yeth.

It make me mad fer see de way dat man walk off wid my ginger-cakes. \"I got so mad, suh, dat I foller \u0027long atter him little ways; but dat ain\u0027 do no good, kaze he come ter whar dee wuz some yuther men, en dee \u0027vide up dem cakes till de wa\u0027n\u0027t no cake lef\u0027.

He want no great big man, suh, en he ain\u0027 make much fuss, yit he lef a mighty big hole at de Tomlinson Place, w\u0027en he pulled out fum dar. Yes, suh; he did dat. It look like it lonesome all over de plan\u0027ation. Marster, he \u0027gun ter git droopy, but eve\u0027y time de dinner bell ring he go ter de foot er de sta\u0027rs en call out: \u0027Come on. Trunion!\u0027 Yes, suh.

One day I run up on Miss Lady settin\u0027 down cryin\u0027, en I ax her w\u0027at de name er goodness de matter, en she say nuff de matter. Den I say she better go ask her pappy whar Trunion, en den she git red in de face, en \u0027low I better go \u0027ten\u0027 ter my business; en den I tell her dat ef somebody ain\u0027 tell us whar Trunion is, en dat mighty quick, dee won\u0027t be no business on dat place fer \u0027ten\u0027 ter. Yes, suh. I tol\u0027 her dat right p\u0027intedly, suh. \"Well, suh, one day Marse Fess Trunion come a-drivin\u0027 up in a shiny double buggy, en he look like he des step right out\u0027n a ban\u0027-box; en ef ever I wuz glad ter see anybody, I wuz glad ter see dat man. Marster wuz glad; en dis time, suh, Miss Lady wuz glad, en she show it right plain; but Mistiss, she still sniff de a\u0027r en hol\u0027 her head high. T\u0027wa\u0027n\u0027t long, suh, \u0027fo\u0027 we all knowd dat Marse Fess wuz gwine marry Miss[129] Lady. I ain\u0027 know how dee fix it, kaze Mistiss never is come right out en say she agreeable \u0027bout it, but Miss Lady wuz a Bledsoe too, en a Tomlinson ter boot, en I ain\u0027 never see nobody w\u0027at impatient nuff fer ter stan\u0027 out \u0027g\u0027inst dat gal. It ain\u0027 all happen, suh, quick ez I tell it, but it happen; en but fer dat, I dunno w\u0027at in de name er goodness would er \u0027come er dis place.\" A few hours later, as I sat with Trunion on the veranda of his house, he verified Aunt Fountain\u0027s story, but not until after he was convinced that I was familiar with the history of the family. There was much in that history he could afford to be proud of, modern though he was. A man who believes in the results of blood in cattle is not likely to ignore the possibility of similar results in human beings; and I think he regarded the matter in some such practical light. He was a man, it seemed, who was disposed to look lightly on trouble, once it was over with; and I found he was not so much impressed with his struggle against the positive scorn and contempt of Mrs. Tomlinson—a struggle that was[130] infinitely more important and protracted than Aunt Fountain had described it to be—as he was with his conflict with Bermuda grass. He told me laughingly of some of his troubles with his hot-headed neighbors in the early days after the war, but nothing of this sort seemed to be as important as his difficulties with Bermuda grass. Here the practical and progressive man showed himself; for I have a very vivid recollection of the desperate attempts of the farmers of that region to uproot and destroy this particular variety. As for Trunion, he conquered it by cultivating it for the benefit of himself and his neighbors; and I suspect that this is the way he conquered his other opponents. It was a great victory over the grass, at any rate. I walked with him over the place, and the picture of it all is still framed in my mind—the wonderful hedges of Cherokee roses, and the fragrant and fertile stretches of green Bermuda through which beautiful fawn-colored cattle were leisurely making their way. He had a theory that this was the only grass in the world fit for the dainty Jersey cow to eat.[131] There were comforts and conveniences on the Tomlinson Place not dreamed of in the old days, and I think there was substantial happiness there too. Trunion himself was a wholesome man, a man full of honest affection, hearty laughter, and hard work—a breezy, companionable, energetic man. There was something boyish, unaffected, and winsome in his manners; and I can easily understand why Judge Addison Tomlinson, in his old age, insisted on astonishing his family and his guests by exclaiming: \"Where\u0027s Trunion?\" Certainly he was a man to think about and inquire after. I have rarely seen a lovelier woman than his wife, and I think her happiness helped to make her so. She had inherited a certain degree of cold stateliness from her ancestors; but her experience after the war, and Trunion\u0027s unaffected ways, had acted as powerful correctives, and there was nothing in the shape of indifference or haughtiness to mar her singular beauty. As for Mrs. Tomlinson—the habit is still strong in me to call her Harriet Bledsoe—I think that in her secret soul she had an ineradicable[132] contempt for Trunion\u0027s extraordinary business energy. I think his \"push and vim,\" as the phrase goes, shocked her sense of propriety to a far greater extent than she would have been willing to admit. But she had little time to think of these matters; for she had taken possession of her grandson, Master Addison Tomlinson Trunion, and was absorbed in his wild and boisterous ways, as grandmothers will be. This boy, a brave and manly little fellow, had Trunion\u0027s temper, but he had inherited the Tomlinson air. It became him well, too, and I think Trunion was proud of it. \"I am glad,\" said I, in parting, \"that I have seen Aunt Fountain\u0027s Prisoner.\" \"Ah!\" said he, looking at his wife, who smiled and blushed, \"that was during the war. Since then I have been a Prisoner of Peace.\" I do not know what industrial theories Trunion has impressed on his neighborhood by this time; but he gave me a practical illustration of the fact that one may be a Yankee and a Southerner too, simply by being a large-hearted, whole-souled American. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2802/77484.html","bookId":549,"book":{"id":549,"title":"Free Joe and Other Georgian Sketches","description":"简介： The name of Free Joe strikes humorously upon the ear of memory.
