{"id":34096,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI","content":"Do?a Magdalena only allowed Jeromín two days in which to rest from the fatigue of his journey, and to visit the village and castle; the third day, which was a Monday, she made him begin at once to regulate his hours and studies, according to the plans she had prepared. She had given him a room near hers, and the chaplain García de Morales, who was to be his tutor and instructor in religion and Christian doctrine, was lodged on the other side. The chaplain Guillén Prieto was given the care of his secular education, and the noble squire Juan Galarza undertook to instruct him in the theory and use of arms and also in riding. \n \n Do?a Magdalena for her part reserved the duty of training him in the love of God and of his neighbour, which she easily did by always showing him the good example of her saintly life, rather than by rules and precepts. Charity was the distinguishing virtue of this great woman, made brighter by her discretion. She thought that the duties of her rank consisted in forwarding God\u0027s glory and the good of her neighbour, particularly of her vassals, to whom she felt specially bound by the mere fact of her position. She gave away her ample income, and, later, distributed her fortune, which was not entailed, in this way, to relieve misery and the material wants of the poor, to supply the needs of their souls, and to increase the service of Our Lord and His honour. \n \n In order to further these objects she founded hospitals on her estates and beyond them, in increasing numbers she redeemed captives, and so continuous and copious were her alms, that after her death she was called \"God\u0027s almoner.\" She also founded colleges, schools, missions and catechisings; and was so munificent in what referred to God\u0027s service that, not content with raising sumptuous temples, at one time she ordered 500 silver chalices to be made and distributed among poor parishes which did not possess any worthy of the Blessed Sacrament, the object of her special devotion. \n \n Do?a Magdalena had ordered her accountant, Luis de Valverde, an honourable old man, to ascertain the wants of the poor of Villagarcia, and to give each one a paper signed by him, setting out what in his opinion was lacking to the bearer. \n \n The poor brought the papers at a special time to Do?a Magdalena, which was very early in the morning, not to interfere with their work. She religiously paid them, adding to the alms the balsam of compassion, good advice and respect for misfortune. This was Do?a Magdalena\u0027s hour of recreation, and she had also chosen it to instil in Jeromín charity and respect towards the poor, which after the fear of God is the first duty of the great and powerful. \n \n This lady got up at sunrise at all times, and at once went to Jeromín\u0027s room to wake and dress him. They heard the mass read by García de Morales, and then Jeromín was dispatched to await in the cloisters the arrival of the poor people. He made them sit on two stone benches which ran along the lower cloisters, giving preference to the old and infirm, and then went to tell his aunt, for by this name, according to Quijada\u0027s wish, the child began to call Do?a Magdalena. \"Aunt! There are such a lot of poor,\" he used to announce. \n \n Then she would come down with two big purses, one filled with silver reales for the poor who were proud and had Valverde\u0027s papers, the other one with pence for the ordinary poor who had no papers, to whom she always gave 20 maravedises and upwards. Do?a Magdalena collected the papers, and Jeromín gave the money, very respectfully, kissing it first, cap in hand. \n \n One day, however, there came among the poor a very dirty old man from Tordehumos; it disgusted Jeromín to touch his hand, so he let the money fall, as if by accident, and the old man had to pick it up. But Do?a Magdalena, guessing the reason, stooped down and picked it up herself, and gave it to the old man, first kissing the dirty hand. Jeromín flushed up to the roots of his hair, and full of shame went on with his task. \n \n Three days afterwards the same old man came again. Jeromín turned crimson on seeing him, intentionally dropped the money, stooped and picked it up, and kneeling humbly down, kissed first the money and then the hand of the old man. \n \n Thus the child profited by and understood the lessons given him, and grew and flourished amid the love and blessings of everyone in the castle. There was only one thing which drew on him scoldings from D. Guillén Prieto and severe remarks from Do?a Magdalena—his studies. He could read Spanish fluently, write well in a running hand, and began to stammer in French, which by the express order of Quijada was taught him by a Fleming, who had come to Villagarcia for the purpose, but Latin with its \"ibus\" and \"orum,\" and Greek with its horrible letters like flies\u0027 legs, were uphill work to the boy, which nothing save the wish to please Do?a Magdalena and to earn her approbation would have made him undertake. But the boy had made a complete conquest of Juan Galarza. No one, according to him, had a better eye, a steadier hand, or was more quick and agile, or more daring and brave, and at the same time more calm, \"and when he got astride either the pony or the Roman mule of my lord D. álvaro, God rest his soul,\" wrote the squire to Fr. Domingo de Ulloa, \"a devil seems to enter him and make him more merry and active and a greater romp than ever.\" \n \n And Do?a Magdalena said with deep conviction, \"Let him grow up and he will be another Luis Quijada, my lord.\" \n \n Periodically she wrote about these things to Quijada, who passed them on to a mysterious person, whom we shall often meet in the course of this history. \n \n \"The person who is in my charge,\" she wrote about then, \"is in good health and to my mind is growing and is a good size for his age. He gets on with his lessons with much difficulty, and he does nothing with so much dislike. He is also learning French, and the few words he knows he pronounces well, though to know it as he should will take more time and practice. What he likes best is to go on horseback riding either with a saddle or bareback, and you will see that he seems as if he would use a lance well, though his strength does not help him yet.\" \n \n This news must have proved to Luis Quijada and his mysterious correspondent that Jeromín\u0027s tastes were not those of a cleric, as his unknown father and Quijada desired they should be. Do?a Magdalena had seen it from the first moment with her usual perspicuity. On his arrival at Villagarcia both she and her brother, Fr. Domingo de Ulloa, wished that she should show the boy the castle and its treasures, so as to be able to judge his character from his first impressions. Nothing caused the boy wonder or even surprise. Not the rich Flemish tapestries with which some of the halls were hung, or the sumptuous beds with their columns and canopies; not the plate which shone everywhere, or the embroidered ornaments in the oratory, purposely displayed before his gaze, or the cast-iron stove which had come from Flanders to warm Do?a Magdalena\u0027s parlour, and which was something then unknown in Spain, and so much prized that it was afterwards taken to Yuste, so that the Emperor himself might make use of it. \n \n The boy looked at everything with the simple indifference of one who has grown up among similar objects, and with high-bred ease that pleased as much as it astonished. \n \n But when he came to the armoury and saw the heavy iron armour, the lances four times as tall as himself, the trophies of shining cuirasses, swords, and shields, the sight of these dread weapons filled him with enthusiasm. He ran about looking at all the details, and at each step stretched out his little hand to touch these wonders, and then drew it back as if he was afraid of hurting them. \n \n Till at last admiration overcoming everything, he stopped before a small suit of very beautiful armour, that Quijada had brought from Italy, which was lying on the ground waiting to be cleaned, and he asked Do?a Magdalena\u0027s leave to touch it, with all a child\u0027s shyness. The lady gladly gave him permission, and with trembling respect, as if he was handling something sacred, he fingered the armour all over, examining the joints, working the visor up and down, and ending by putting his fist into the cuirass. This made a metallic sound, and Jeromín lifted his radiant face towards his protectors with a smile on his lips, and a look in his eyes that showed his character. \n \n The lady, half smiling and half astonished, said to her brother, \"Luis Quijada, my lord, will be annoyed. We have here a little soldier and no monk.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1668/49124.html","bookId":1193,"book":{"id":1193,"title":"The Story of Don John of Austria","description":"简介： In one of the addresses delivered at the time of Padre Coloma\u0027s admission to the Real Academia Espa?ola there is a reference to Jeromn, as this Story of Don John of Austria is called in Spanish, which says that it awakes great interest in the reader...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1668","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
