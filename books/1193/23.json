{"id":34112,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER VI","content":"This adventure made D. John the fashion, as we should say now, a thing which existed in the sixteenth century without being so called. He became the spoilt child of the Court and the idol of the people, to such a degree that many of them wished him to be the heir to the crown, in default of D. Carlos. \\n\\n \\n\\n D. John\u0027s good looks had much to do with this; he was then only nineteen, but was already perfectly developed. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was of a good height, slim and altogether graceful, because neatness was as much a part of him as flexibility is of fine-tempered steel. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had fair hair, brushed up to the left in the form of a toupee, a fashion made common by his imitators and called \"à la Austriaca\"; his beard, the same colour as his hair, was thin; his complexion pale, but rather sunburnt, which gave him a pleasing, manly appearance; big blue eyes, always clear and bright, which could be smiling and loving or grave and severe, as he wished. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was debonair and very nice in his person, and ostentatious in his dress, which was always in the extreme of fashion, as may be seen in some of his pictures. \\n\\n \\n\\n That which radiated from him and made him so irresistible was that \"je ne sais quoi\" belonging to very superior men, which attracts, enchants, and subjugates, and, according to a very profound writer, consists in the mysterious combination of grace, talent, and desire to please. \\n\\n \\n\\n Such was the attractive figure of D. John when he began to be a real personage at the much-discussed Court of his brother. \\n\\n \\n\\n Certainly that Court was not then, if it ever was, the gloomy, austere convent, represented to us by those who believe, or seem to believe, in an awesome legendary Philip II, surrounded by holocausts and gallows, and Inquisitors and friars. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor was it either the united family of devout maidens and saintly matrons, venerable old men and immaculate pages, which those make out who would, in all good faith, imprison the colossal Philip II in the rickety form of a devout monk. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Court of Philip II was certainly the strictest of its day, but it was also the most magnificent, sumptuous and full of harmless amusement and the knight errantry of those times, without lacking, as was natural, intrigues, plots and scandals between gallants and ladies. These D. Philip sometimes put down openly with a firm hand, at others corrected secretly, and not a few he pretended not to notice, for reasons which must always remain unknown. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Court was divided, as nearly always happens, into two absolutely different camps—the courtly and the political. \\n\\n \\n\\n The principal personages of the former at that time were two princesses, as remarkable for their virtue as for their beauty, and united by the bonds of the tenderest friendship. They were the Queen Isabel de Valois and the widowed Princess of Portugal, Do?a Juana, the first aged only twenty and the other thirty at this date. \\n\\n \\n\\n Their circle included the numerous ladies of both their suites, belonging to the highest Spanish nobility, although the Queen\u0027s included a few Frenchwomen and the Princess\u0027s several Portuguese, and these foreigners were always at war with the Spanish women. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Queen\u0027s ladies numbered over fifty, all spinsters, and they only remained at the palace until the King had found advantageous alliances for them. \\n\\n \\n\\n There were also ten duennas of honour, all widows and ladies of high rank, and at their head the Camarera Mayor, who had to be a lady of quality, and was, at that time, the Dowager Condesa de Urena, Do?a Maria de la Cueva, a matron of great judgment and experience and the mother of the first Duque de Osuna. \\n\\n \\n\\n Photo Anderson \\n\\n \\n\\n ELIZABETH DE VALOIS. ISABEL DE LA PAZ, \\n\\n THIRD WIFE OF PHILIP II \\n\\n \\n\\n From her picture by Pantoja de La Cruz in Prado Gallery, Madrid \\n\\n \\n\\n Princess Juana also had her ladies, her very respectable duennas, and her Camarera Mayor, Do?a Isabel de Qui?ones. Do?a Elenor Mascarenas, her former and beloved and revered governess, had already retired from the Court, and was then founding, in what is to-day the square of Santo Domingo, the convent of the Angels, where, years afterwards, she ended her holy life. \\n\\n \\n\\n It pleased the Queen to amuse her ladies with riding, hunting, picnics in the groves, balls, masquerades and theatricals in her apartments, in which they all, including the Queen, took part, and where they also played, at times so high, that in one night Prince Carlos, at a game called \"el clavo,\" lost 100 golden crowns, according to the declaration of his barber Ruy Diaz de Quitanilla, who had lent them to the Prince. \\n\\n \\n\\n To these entertainments the Queen was in the habit of inviting also all the great ladies who had no places at Court, but who lived in Madrid, or those who were only passing through, particularly the Princess of évoli, of whom she was always a great friend, and the Duquesa de Alba, Do?a Maria Enríquez, who was afterwards her Camarera Mayor, and at all times deserved the greatest affection and respect. \\n\\n \\n\\n Princess Juana for her part was very fond of the country, and often retired to the Pardo, where she had brilliant concerts which were festivals of real pleasure and enjoyment, with many musicians and singers, whom she kept in her service and paid. \\n\\n \\n\\n In these high circles D. John of Austria sought and found his lady love, and here he performed his first deeds of arms and of gallantry, thinking, in his simplicity, that the loves of youth might be found in the midst of dangers, in the platonic spheres of the fantastic Orianas, Angelicas, and Melisandres of whom his head was full, and who stirred his blood and heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n All that was most select among the youth at the Court naturally grouped itself round D. John, and it was he who set the tone, arranged the tournaments, hunts, cane games, masquerades and \"camisadas\" which then formed the pleasures of the young nobles. \\n\\n \\n\\n But although all sought his favour, only two became intimate with him, and continued so until death, the Conde de Orgaz and D. Rodrigo de Mendoza, second son of the Duque del Infantado. \\n\\n \\n\\n At this time, too, there inserted himself first into D. John\u0027s acquaintance and then into his friendship, a very clever youth of mean birth and great personal charm, who afterwards brought D. John great misfortunes, and who at that time was driving him with great astuteness into one of the two parties which then divided the political camp at Court. His name was Antonio Pérez, the illegitimate son of the ecclesiastic Gonzalo Pérez, secretary first to the Emperor, then to Philip II. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two parties in the Court fought over the little power which the all-absorbing personal government of Philip left to his ministers. At the head of one was the great Duque de Alba, who represented the purely warlike policy of force; the other was led by the Prince of évoli, D. Ruy Gómez, representing the opposite policy of diplomacy, intrigue and peace. \\n\\n \\n\\n The followers of the first were the Prior D. Antonio de Toledo, the Prince of Mélito, the Marqués de Aguilar, and the secretary, Zayas; the partisans of the other were the Archbishop of Toledo, D. Gaspar de Quiroga, the Marqués de los Vélez, Mateo Vázguez, Santoyo and Gonzalo Pérez. \\n\\n \\n\\n It is most extraordinary that the open, generous nature of D. John did not lead him to the side of the Duque de Alba, and that, on the contrary, he joined the Prince of évoli, who rather represented the lawyers and churchmen, but no doubt the explanation must be sought in the cleverness which this party displayed in attracting him, guessing the genuine great qualities of the illustrious youth. \\n\\n \\n\\n They first provided Antonio Pérez, who with adroit flatteries, in which he was a past master, and with studied confidences as between man and man, made D. John understand how much he was appreciated by the coterie of Ruy Gómez, the great hopes they placed in his bravery and influence, and how much they were trying to work on the King to name him Captain-General of the Mediterranean galleys, as he had already promised. \\n\\n \\n\\n All of which, it is unnecessary to say, assumed a great air of truth in the mouth of the son of Gonzalo Pérez, who through this channel might well know what was happening, since it was intended that he should succeed his father in the appointment. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the ground was sufficiently prepared for such an important personage to step in without danger, Ruy Gómez arranged a meeting, as if by accident, with D. John, and repeated the same things in a different way, adding that his appointment was already settled and that it was a magnificent one, as also was the ship \"Capitana,\" which was being got ready at Barcelona, that it would not be long before his desire of fighting the Turks was gratified at the head of a brilliant squadron, and that was a foregone conclusion. \\n\\n \\n\\n Gonzalo Pérez died this year (1566), and Philip II resisted the efforts of Ruy Gómez to obtain his father\u0027s vacant secretaryship for Antonio Pérez, giving as a pretext, not his youth, for he was thirty-two, but the laxity of his life and the depravity of his morals. \\n\\n \\n\\n Taking, however, as a sign of repentance and amendment Antonio Pérez\u0027s marriage with Do?a Juana de Coello Bozmediano, which was celebrated on the 3rd of January, 1567, D. Philip hastened to bestow on him Gonzalo Pérez\u0027s secretaryship, which delighted D. John as much as if it were the summit of his ambitions or the triumph of his interests. \\n\\n \\n\\n Once having caught the Prince on the weak side of his ambitions, they wished to do so on that of his platonic love. The Princess de évoli undertook this, attracting him to her house, giving in his honour balls and banquets, and putting before his eyes, and even within his reach, the lady, the object of his then honest intentions, Do?a Maria de Mendoza, one of the ladies of the Palace, and it is thought a near kinswoman of the restless, intriguing Princess. Such artifices did the Princess use to influence the will and gain the confidence of the grateful D. John, that years afterwards, when she was no longer the intriguing, restless lady of former times, but the shameless, criminal woman who plotted with Antonio Pérez perfidious treasons which were, incidentally, to ruin D. John himself, the latter wrote, nevertheless, to his friend D. Rodrigo de Mendoza with the utmost affection and blind confidence: \"I kiss the hands of my one-eyed lady, and I do not say her eyes until I write it to her, in order that she may remember this her friend, so much her friend now, who cannot do more, nor has anything else to offer her in payment of his debt. And the reason that this message is sent with so much prudence is that, coming from such a distance, it cannot be otherwise.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1668/49140.html","bookId":1193,"book":{"id":1193,"title":"The Story of Don John of Austria","description":"简介： In one of the addresses delivered at the time of Padre Coloma\u0027s admission to the Real Academia Espa?ola there is a reference to Jeromn, as this Story of Don John of Austria is called in Spanish, which says that it awakes great interest in the reader...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1668","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
