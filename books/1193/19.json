{"id":34108,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER II","content":"At length the Court removed to Madrid, very soon after the investiture of D. Carlos, and the King gave D. John of Austria, as his residence, the house of D. Pedro de Porras, which was in front of St. Mary\u0027s and very near the castle. Half a century later the Duque de Uceda erected his magnificent palace on the site of this house, and it forms the edifice occupied by the Military Governor and the Council of State to-day. \n \n In it D. John was installed with Luis Quijada and Do?a Magdalena de Ulloa, and, beyond the respect due to the new position of the son of Charles V, his relations with them were the same as in the six years of quiet, happy intimacy at Villagarcia. D. John went each day to the royal castle with all the pomp of a prince, to study and play with D. Carlos and to pay his respects to the King and the good Queen Do?a Isabel de Valois, who always kept him a long time, and loaded him with attentions and invitations, to the great satisfaction of all her ladies. He also daily visited his sister, Princess Juana, and often accompanied her on her visits to churches and other holy places. This all naturally pleased the new-made prince; but when he got home and met Do?a Magdalena in her room, always occupied about something for his welfare, then it was that he really opened out and showed himself the old Jeromín, loving his aunt as a very dear mother. He would sit on a cushion at Do?a Magdalena\u0027s feet, and, with his head leaning against her knee, according to his custom, would confide to her the impressions of the day, and pour out his soul with the candour and simplicity of his early years. \n \n An unexpected catastrophe came to trouble this quiet life. On the 24th of November, a little before dawn, a peasant of Alcorcón came into the town by the gate of the Vega riding his donkey. He was frightened by the vivid light which illuminated the little square and fa?ade of St. Mary\u0027s, and he then saw that flames were issuing from the roof of D. John of Austria\u0027s house. \n \n It consisted of only two stories, like all the best houses in the town, which in arrangement and architecture were very like that of Valmediano in the square of the Cortes, or that of the Marqués de Corbera in the streets of La Bola, with the only difference that those of the nobles had strong towers at not less than two of their angles. Alarmed that no one in the house was aware of this formidable fire, the boy began to shout and to knock on the door, crying out, \"Fire! Fire! Wake up.\" \n \n They all woke up terrified, and Quijada, as years before at Villagarcia, ran to save Don John of Austria. He met him getting out of bed and hastening to help Do?a Magdalena, but without taking any account of his cries and efforts to run to the room of his aunt, Quijada took him in his arms, dressed as he was in his shirt, and going into the street, deposited him on the steps of St. Mary\u0027s. Then with great calmness Quijada went back among the flames to save Do?a Magdalena, and deposited her, also half dressed, beside D. John. \n \n Then the fire broke out with such tremendous fury, that in spite of the house being so large, in half an hour it was an immense bonfire, and five hours later a mountain of rubbish, among which the only thing that remained standing was the wall of D. John\u0027s bedchamber. \n \n Hanging on this wall the famous crucifix of the Moors, saved by Luis Quijada once before from the flames, which, after D. John came to Villagarcia, Do?a Magdalena had placed at the head of his bed, remained intact. This was thought to be a miracle, and it was certainly, at least, a special providence of God to save such a venerated image. \n \n The neighbours hurried at once to the spot, mostly poor people who with the utmost good-will offered clothes to D. John and to Do?a Magdalena to cover them. All, however, drew aside and formed a respectful path for a pair who emerged from the narrow lane of St. Mary, which existed then between the church of this name and the house which was afterwards that of the Duque de Abrantes. \"Rey Gómez,\" \"Rey Gómez,\" murmured the crowd. And all drew to one side and showed that sort of frightened admiration which takes hold of the lower orders when they have to rub shoulders with the great, whom they usually only see at a distance. \n \n He whom they called Rey Gómez was a man no longer young, of noble bearing and very refined features, with black, curly beard and hair which was already beginning to turn grey. \n \n The lady accompanying him was wrapped up in a short cloak, which did not hide her tall, good figure or her handsome, proud, pale face, sadly disfigured by her right eye being blind. She came to Do?a Magdalena and embraced her with great signs of compassion and affection, as if they were old friends, offering her clothes which her servants brought and shelter in her own house, which was behind that called de Abrantes, and is to-day the Italian Embassy. The gentleman did the same by D. John and Luis Quijada, and they went to the house of the one-eyed lady, escorted by the crowd. \n \n This lady was the very celebrated Princess de évoli, Do?a Ana Mendoza de la Cerda, who later had so much influence over the fate of D. John of Austria; and the gentleman was her husband, the Prince de évoli, Ruy Gómez de Silva, a great favourite, while he lived, of the King, Philip II, for which reason the common people had changed his name from Ruy Gómez to Rey Gómez, to show the great power and favour he enjoyed. \n \n For two long months D. John, Quijada and Do?a Magdalena stayed in the house of the Prince and Princess de évoli, as the King did not have his new house suitably furnished; this house was that of the Conde de Lemus, joining the parish church of Santiago. \n \n Meanwhile the health of Prince Carlos got visibly worse from day to day, making his character strange and gloomy. Philip II, by the advice of the doctors, then determined to give him change of air, and for this purpose sent him to Alcalá de Henares with D. John of Austria and Alexander Farnese, that they might at the same time continue their studies there under the care of Honorato Juan, who had directed them from the first. \n \n So the Prince set out with all his household for Alcalá de Henares on the 31st of October, and three days later D. John of Austria followed with his household, and Alexander Farnese with his humble retinue. The two first lodged in the palace belonging to the Archbishop of Toledo, an airy, healthy dwelling, with big orchards and shady gardens. \n \n King Philip spared no means or expense which could contribute to the brilliant education of the three Princes. \n \n The most famous doctors of the then flourishing University of Alcalá read them their lectures in private, and helped them with every kind of book and manuscript, about which Honorato Juan was extremely learned. Under his direction was copied at that time in Alcalá, solely with a view to the education of the three Princes, the celebrated manuscript of the scientific works compiled by Alfonso the Wise. Diego de Valencia copied the text, and Juan de Herrera went expressly to draw the astronomical figures with which it was illustrated. Philip II himself ordered and wrote with his own hand the arrangement of the hours of study, rest and recreation which the three illustrious students were daily to observe. \n \n They got up at six in the morning in summer, at seven in winter, and after bathing, dressing, and combing their hair, said their prayers in the presence of the Lord Steward and Gentlemen of the Bedchamber, all on their knees. In these prayers they very especially prayed for the Kings of the earth and the souls of the dead. \n \n Then the three Princes breakfasted together, and afterwards heard Mass in D. Carlos\u0027s private chapel. \n \n Two hours of continual study with masters followed, always presided over by Honorato Juan. The lessons invariably began by reciting the Veni Creator, and ended by giving thanks to God. At eleven the three Princes left their room to dine in public; at twelve they had a music and singing lesson till one, and from that hour until four o\u0027clock they returned to their studies, with which were interpolated riding and fencing lessons. \n \n From four to five the Princes amused themselves as they liked with the gentlemen of the bedchamber and the gentlemen whom, with the approval of his tutor, D. García de Toledo, the Prince received. Supper was at six o\u0027clock, and after this, until nine, they went for walks and played games, according to the weather and as they pleased. At nine they said their beads all together, and then each one retired to his room. Sundays and feast-days the hours of study were occupied in pious exercises, walks and games of skill and amusement. The union and intimacy of the three Princes grew owing to this life, though it did not prevent their often having the quarrels natural to their age, which were always caused by D. Carlos\u0027s hasty and ungovernable temper. Playing one day at pelota with D. John of Austria, a discussion arose about a doubtful stroke, and as the Prince had no more reasons to give he turned his back on D. John very rudely, saying that he could not argue with him, as he was not his equal by birth. D. John sprang like a wild beast, and, seizing D. Carlos\u0027s coat, told him proudly that his mother was a German great lady, and that his father had been a much greater man than was that of D. Carlos. The latter was at once frightened, but afterwards, the first time the King came to see them, he referred to the subject. To which D. Philip gravely answered: \n \n \"D. John is right. His mother is a German lady; and his father, the Emperor, my Lord, who was much greater than I am or ever can be. Note well, D. Carlos, the only thing in which he never equals you, is in pride and bad manners.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1668/49136.html","bookId":1193,"book":{"id":1193,"title":"The Story of Don John of Austria","description":"简介： In one of the addresses delivered at the time of Padre Coloma\u0027s admission to the Real Academia Espa?ola there is a reference to Jeromn, as this Story of Don John of Austria is called in Spanish, which says that it awakes great interest in the reader...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1668","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
