How could you survive in a lifeboat with one? It\u0027s – \"\"What you don\u0027t realize is that we are a strange andforbidding species to wild animals. We fill them with fear. Theyavoid us as much as possible. It took centuries to still the fearin some pliable animals – domestication it\u0027s called – but mostcannot get over their fear, and I doubt they ever will. Whenwild animals fight us, it is out of sheer desperation. They fightwhen they feel they have no other way out. It\u0027s a very lastresort.\"\"In a lifeboat? Come on, Mr. Patel, it\u0027s just too hard tobelieve!\"\"Hard to believe? What do you know about hard to believe? You want hard to believe? I\u0027ll give you hard to believe. It\u0027s aclosely held secret among Indian zookeepers that in 1971 Barathe polar bear escaped from the Calcutta Zoo. She was neverheard from again, not by police or hunters or poachers oranyone else. We suspect she\u0027s living freely on the banks of theHugli River. Beware if you go to Calcutta, my good sirs: if youhave sushi on the breath you may pay a high price! If youtook the city of Tokyo and turned it upside down and shookit, you\u0027d be amazed at all the animals that would fall out: badgers, wolves, boa constrictors, Komodo dragons, crocodiles,ostriches, baboons, capybaras, wild boars, leopards, manatees,ruminants in untold numbers. There is no doubt in my mindthat feral giraffes and feral hippos have been living in Tokyofor generations without being seen by a soul. You shouldcompare one day the things that stick to the soles of yourshoes as you walk down the street with what you see lying atthe bottom of the cages in the Tokyo Zoo – then look up! And you expect to find a tiger in a Mexican jungle! It\u0027slaughable, just plain laughable. Ha! Ha! Ha!\"\"There may very well be feral giraffes and feral hippos livingin Tokyo and a polar bear living freely in Calcutta. We justdon\u0027t believe there was a tiger living in your lifeboat.\"\"The arrogance of big-city folk! You grant your metropolisesall the animals of Eden, but you deny my hamlet the merestBengal tiger!\"\"Mr. Patel, please calm down.\"\"If you stumble at mere believability, what are you living for?

God is hard to believe, ask any believer. What is your problemwith hard to believe?\"\"We\u0027re just being reasonable.\"\"So am I! I applied my reason at every moment.

By the way, how doyou explain the meerkat bones in the lifeboat?\"\"Yes, the bones of a small animal were – \"\"More than one!\"\" – of some small animals were found in the lifeboat.

You win. We cannot explain thepresence of meerkat bones, if that is what they are, in thelifeboat. But that is not our concern here.

It made a sound like a monstrous metallicburp. Things bubbled at the surface and then vanished. I foundmyself kicking water in the Pacific Ocean. I swam for thelifeboat. It was the hardest swim of my life. I didn\u0027t seem tobe moving. I kept swallowing water. I was very cold. I wasrapidly losing strength. I wouldn\u0027t have made it if the cookhadn\u0027t thrown me a lifebuoy and pulled me in. I climbedaboard and collapsed. \"Four of us survived. Mother held on to some bananas andmade it to the lifeboat. The cook was already aboard, as wasthe sailor. \"He ate the flies. The cook, that is. We hadn\u0027t been in thelifeboat a full day; we had food and water to last us forweeks; we had fishing gear and solar stills; we had no reasonto believe that we wouldn\u0027t be rescued soon. Yet there he was,swinging his arms and catching flies and eating them greedily. Right away he was in a holy terror of hunger. He was callingus idiots and fools for not joining him in the feast. We wereoffended and disgusted, but we didn\u0027t show it. We were verypolite about it. He was a stranger and a foreigner. Mothersmiled and shook her head and raised her hand in refusal. Hewas a disgusting man. His mouth had the discrimination of agarbage heap. He also ate the rat. He cut it up and dried it inthe sun. I – I\u0027ll be honest – I had a small piece, very small,behind Mother\u0027s back. I was so hungry. He was such a brute,that cook, ill-tempered and hypocritical. \"The sailor was young. Actually, he was older than me,probably in his early twenties, but he broke his leg jumpingfrom the ship and his suffering made him a child. He wasbeautiful. He had no facial hair at all and a clear, shiningcomplexion. His features – the broad face, the flattened nose,the narrow, pleated eyes – looked so elegant. I thought helooked like a Chinese emperor. His suffering was terrible. Hespoke no English, not a single word, not yes or no, hello orthank you. He spoke only Chinese. We couldn\u0027t understand aword he said. He must have felt very lonely. When he wept,Mother held his head in her lap and I held his hand. It wasvery, very sad. He suffered and we couldn\u0027t do anything aboutit. \"His right leg was badly broken at the thigh. The bone stuckout of his flesh. He screamed with pain. We set his leg as bestwe could and we made sure he was eating and drinking. Buthis leg became infected. Though we drained it of pus everyday, it got worse. His foot became black and bloated. \"It was the cook\u0027s idea. He was a brute. He dominated us. He whispered that the blackness would spread and that hewould survive only if his leg were amputated. Since the bonewas broken at the thigh, it would involve no more than cuttingthrough flesh and setting a tourniquet. I can still hear his evilwhisper. He would do the job to save the sailor\u0027s life, he said,but we would have to hold him. Surprise would be the onlyanaesthetic. We fell upon him. Mother and I held his armswhile the cook sat on his good leg. The sailor writhed andscreamed. His chest rose and fell. The cook worked the knifequickly. The leg fell off. Immediately Mother and I let go andmoved away. We thought that if the restraint was ended, sowould his struggling. We thought he would lie calmly. He didn\u0027t. He sat up instantly. His screams were all the worse for beingunintelligible. He screamed and we stared, transfixed. There wasblood everywhere. Worse, there was the contrast between thefrantic activity of the poor sailor and the gentle repose of hisleg at the bottom of the boat. He kept looking at the limb, asif imploring it to return. At last he fell back. We hurried intoaction. The cook folded some skin over the bone. We wrappedthe stump in a piece of cloth and we tied a rope above thewound to stop the bleeding. We laid him as comfortably as wecould on a mattress of life jackets and kept him warm. Ithought it was all for nothing. I couldn\u0027t believe a human beingcould survive so much pain, so much butchery. Throughout theevening and night he moaned, and his breathing was harshand uneven. He had fits of agitated delirium. I expected him todie during the night. \"He clung to life. At dawn he was still alive. He went in andout of consciousness. Mother gave him water. I caught sight ofthe amputated leg. It cut my breath short. In the commotion ithad been shoved aside and forgotten in the dark. It hadseeped a liquid and looked thinner. I took a life jacket andused it as a glove. I picked the leg up. \"‘What are you doing?\u0027 asked the cook. \"I\u0027m going to throw it overboard,‘ I replied. \" ‘Don\u0027t be an idiot. We\u0027ll use it as bait. That was the wholepoint.\u0027 \"He seemed to regret his last words even as they werecoming out, for his voice faded quickly. He turned away. \"‘The whole point? Mother asked. \u0027What do you mean bythat?‘\"He pretended to be busy. \"Mother\u0027s voice rose. ‘Are you telling us that we cut thispoor boy\u0027s leg off not to save his life but to get fishing bait? \"Silence from the brute. \"‘Answer me!\u0027 shouted Mother. \"Like a cornered beast he lifted his eyes and glared at her. ‘Our supplies are running out,\u0027 he snarled. ‘We need morefood or we\u0027ll die.\u0027 \"Mother returned his glare. ‘Our supplies are not runningout! We have plenty of food and water. We have packageupon package of biscuits to tide us over till our rescue.\u0027 Shetook hold of the plastic container in which we put the openrations of biscuits. It was unexpectedly light in her hands. Thefew crumbs in it rattled. ‘What!\u0027 She opened it. ‘Where are thebiscuits? The container was full last night!\u0027 \"The cook looked away. As did I. \"‘You selfish monster!\u0027 screamed Mother. ‘The only reasonwe\u0027re running out of food is because you\u0027re gorging yourself onit!\u0027 \"‘He had some too,\u0027 he said, nodding my way. \"Mother\u0027s eyes turned to me. My heart sank. \"‘Piscine, is that true?\u0027 \"‘It was night, Mother. I was half asleep and I was sohungry. He gave me a biscuit. I ate it without thinking…\u0027 \"‘Only one, was it?\u0027 sneered the cook. \"It was Mother\u0027s turn to look away. The anger seemed togo out of her. Without saying another word she went back tonursing the sailor. \"I wished for her anger. I wished for her to punish me. Only not this silence. I made to arrange some life jackets forthe sailor\u0027s comfort so that I could be next to her. I whispered,‘I\u0027m sorry, Mother, I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 My eyes were brimming withtears. When I brought them up, I saw that hers were too. Butshe didn\u0027t look at me. Her eyes were gazing upon somememory in mid-air. \"‘We\u0027re all alone, Piscine, all alone,\u0027 she said, in a tone thatbroke every hope in my body. I never felt so lonely in all mylife as I did at that moment. We had been in the lifeboat twoweeks already and it was taking its toll on us. It was gettingharder to believe that Father and Ravi had survived. \"When we turned around, the cook was holding the leg bythe ankle over the water to drain it. Mother brought her handover the sailor\u0027s eyes. \"He died quietly, the life drained out of him like the liquidfrom his leg. The cook promptly butchered him. The leg hadmade for poor bait. The dead flesh was too decayed to holdon to the fishing hook; it simply dissolved in the water. Nothingwent to waste with this monster. He cut up everything,including the sailor\u0027s skin and every inch of his intestines. Heeven prepared his genitals. When he had finished with historso, he moved on to his arms and shoulders and to his legs. Mother and I rocked with pain and horror. Mother shrieked atthe cook, ‘How can you do this, you monster? Where is yourhumanity? Have you no decency? What did the poor boy doto you? You monster! You monster!\u0027 The cook replied withunbelievable vulgarity. \"‘At least cover his face, for God\u0027s sake!\u0027 cried my mother. Itwas unbearable to have that beautiful face, so noble andserene, connected to such a sight below. The cook threwhimself upon the sailor\u0027s head and before our very eyesscalped him and pulled off his face. Mother and I vomited. \"When he had finished, he threw the butchered carcassoverboard. Shortly after, strips of flesh and pieces of organswere lying to dry in the sun all over the boat. We recoiled inhorror. We tried not to look at them. The smell would not goaway. \"The next time the cook was close by, Mother slapped himin the face, a full hard slap that punctuated the air with asharp crack. It was something shocking coming from mymother. And it was heroic. It was an act of outrage and pityand grief and bravery. It was done in memory of that poorsailor. It was to salvage his dignity. \"I was stunned. So was the cook. He stood without movingor saying a word as Mother looked him straight in the face. Inoticed how he did not meet her eyes. \"We retreated to our private spaces. I stayed close to her. Iwas filled with a mix of rapt admiration and abject fear. \"Mother kept an eye on him. Two days later she saw himdo it. He tried to be discreet, but she saw him bring his handto his mouth. She shouted, ‘I saw you! You just ate a piece! You said it was for bait! I knew it. You monster! You animal! How could you? He\u0027s human! He\u0027s your own kind!\u0027 If shehad expected him to be mortified, to spit it out and breakdown and apologize, she was wrong. He kept chewing. In fact,he lifted his head up and quite openly put the rest of the stripin his mouth. Tastes like pork,‘ he muttered. Mother expressedher indignation and disgust by violently turning away. He ateanother strip. \u0027I feel stronger already,‘ he muttered. Heconcentrated on his fishing. \"We each had our end of the lifeboat. It\u0027s amazing howwillpower can build walls. Whole days went by as if he weren\u0027tthere. \"But we couldn\u0027t ignore him entirely. He was a brute, but apractical brute. He was good with his hands and he knew thesea. He was full of good ideas. He was the one who thoughtof building a raft to help with the fishing. If we survived anytime at all, it was thanks to him. I helped him as best I could. He was very short-tempered, always shouting at me andinsulting me. \"Mother and I didn\u0027t eat any of the sailor\u0027s body, not thesmallest morsel, despite the cost in weakness to us, but we didstart to eat what the cook caught from the sea. My mother, alifelong vegetarian, brought herself to eat raw fish and rawturtle. She had a very hard time of it. She never got over herrevulsion. It came easier to me. I found hunger improved thetaste of everything. \"When your life has been given a reprieve, it\u0027s impossiblenot to feel some warmth for the one to whom you owe thatreprieve. It was very exciting when the cook hauled aboard aturtle or caught a great big dorado. It made us smile broadlyand there was a glow in our chests that lasted for hours. Mother and the cook talked in a civil way, even joked. Duringsome spectacular sunsets, life on the boat was nearly good. Atsuch times I looked at him with – yes – with tenderness. Withlove. I imagined that we were fast friends. He was a coarseman even when he was in a good mood, but we pretendednot to notice it, even to ourselves. He said that we wouldcome upon an island. That was our main hope. We exhaustedour eyes scanning the horizon for an island that never came. That\u0027s when he stole food and water. \"The flat and endless Pacific rose like a great wall aroundus. I never thought we would get around it. \"He killed her. The cook killed my mother. We werestarving. I was weak. I couldn\u0027t hold on to a turtle. Because ofme we lost it. He hit me. Mother hit him. He hit her back. She turned to me and said, ‘Go!\u0027 pushing me towards the raft. I jumped for it. I thought she was coming with me. I landedin the water. I scrambled aboard the raft. They were fighting. Idid nothing but watch. My mother was fighting an adult man. He was mean and muscular. He caught her by the wrist andtwisted it. She shrieked and fell. He moved over her. The knifeappeared. He raised it in the air. It came down. Next it wasup – it was red. It went up and down repeatedly. I couldn\u0027tsee her. She was at the bottom of the boat. I saw only him. He stopped. He raised his head and looked at me. He hurledsomething my way. A line of blood struck me across the face. No whip could have inflicted a more painful lash. I held mymother\u0027s head in my hands. I let it go. It sank in a cloud ofblood, her tress trailing like a tail. Fish spiralled down towardsit until a shark\u0027s long grey shadow cut across its path and itvanished. I looked up. I couldn\u0027t see him. He was hiding at thebottom of the boat. He appeared when he threw my mother\u0027sbody overboard. His mouth was red. The water boiled withfish. \"I spent the rest of that day and the night on the raft,looking at him. We didn\u0027t speak a word. He could have cutthe raft loose. But he didn\u0027t. He kept me around, like a badconscience. \"In the morning, in plain sight of him, I pulled on the ropeand boarded the lifeboat. I was very weak. He said nothing. Ikept my peace. He caught a turtle. He gave me its blood. Hebutchered it and laid its best parts for me on the middlebench. I ate. \"Then we fought and I killed him. He had no expression onhis face, neither of despair nor of anger, neither of fear nor ofpain. He gave up. He let himself be killed, though it was still astruggle. He knew he had gone too far, even by his bestialstandards. He had gone too far and now he didn\u0027t want to goon living any more. But he never said ‘I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 Why do wecling to our evil ways? \"The knife was all along in plain view on the bench. Weboth knew it. He could have had it in his hands from thestart. He was the one who put it there. I picked it up, Istabbed him in the stomach. He grimaced but remainedstanding. I pulled the knife out and stabbed him again. Bloodwas pouring out. Still he didn\u0027t fall over. Looking me in theeyes, he lifted his head ever so slightly. Did he meansomething by this? I took it that he did. I stabbed him in thethroat, next to the Adam\u0027s apple. He dropped like a stone. And died. He didn\u0027t say anything. He had no last words. Heonly coughed up blood. A knife has a horrible dynamic power;once in motion, it\u0027s hard to stop. I stabbed him repeatedly. Hisblood soothed my chapped hands. His heart was a struggle –all those tubes that connected it. I managed to get it out. Ittasted delicious, far better than turtle. I ate his liver. I cut offgreat pieces of his flesh. \"He was such an evil man. Worse still, he met evil in me –selfishness, anger, ruthlessness. I must live with that. \"Solitude began. I turned to God. I survived.\"[Long silence] \"Is that better? Are there any parts you find hard tobelieve? Anything you\u0027d like me to change?\"Mr. Chiba: [translation] \"What a horrible story.\"[Long silence] Mr. Okamoto: \"Both the zebra and the Taiwanese sailorbroke a leg, did you notice that\"\"No, I didn\u0027t.\"\"And the hyena bit off the zebra leg just as the cook cut offthe sailor\u0027s.\"\"Ohhh, Okamoto-san, you see a lot.\"\"The blind Frenchman they met in the other lifeboat – didn\u0027the admit to killing a man and a woman?\"\"Yes, he did.\"\"The cook killed the sailor and his mother.\"‘Very impressive.\"\"His stories match.\"\"So the Taiwanese sailor is the zebra, his mother is theorang-utan, the cook is … the hyena – which means he\u0027s thetiger!\"\"Yes. The tiger killed the hyena – and the blind Frenchman– just as he killed the cook.\" [/translation] Pi Patel: \"Do you have another chocolate bar?\"Mr. Chiba: \"Right away!\"\"Thank you.\"Mr. Chiba: [translation] \"But what does it mean,Okamoto-san?\"\"I have no idea.\"\"And what about the island? Who are the meerkats?\"\"I don\u0027t know.\"\"And those teeth? Whose teeth were those in the tree?\"\"I don\u0027t know I\u0027m not inside the boy\u0027s head.\" [/translation] [Long silence] Mr. Okamoto: \"Please excuse me for asking, but did thecook say anything about the sinking of the Tsimtsum? \"In this other story?\"\"Yes.\"\"He didn\u0027t.\"\"He made no mention of anything leading up to the earlymorning of July 2nd that might explain what happened?\"\"No.\"\"Nothing of a nature mechanical or structural?\"\"No.\"\"Nothing about other ships or objects at sea?\"\"No.\"\"He could not explain the sinking of the Tsimtsum at all?\"\"No.\"\"Could he say why it didn\u0027t send out a distress signal?\"\"And if it had? In my experience, when a dingy, third-raterustbucket sinks, unless it has the luck of carrying oil, lots of it,enough to kill entire ecosystems, no one cares and no onehears about it. You\u0027re on your own.\"\"When Oika realized that something was wrong, it was toolate. You were too far out for air rescue. Ships in the areawere told to be on the lookout. They reported seeing nothing.\"\"And while we\u0027re on the subject, the ship wasn\u0027t the onlything that was third-rate. The crew were a sullen, unfriendly lot,hard at work when officers were around but ‘doing nothingwhen they weren\u0027t. They didn\u0027t speak a word of English andthey were of no help to us. Some of them stank of alcohol bymid-afternoon. Who\u0027s to say what those idiots did? The officers– \"\"What do you mean by that?\"\"By what?\"\"‘Who\u0027s to say what those idiots did?\u0027\"\"I mean that maybe in a fit of drunken insanity some ofthem released the animals.\"Mr. Chiba: \"Who had the keys to the cages?\"\"Father did.\"Mr. Chiba: \"So how could the crew open the cages if theydidn\u0027t have the keys?\"\"I don\u0027t know. They probably used crowbars.\"Mr. Chiba: \"Why would they do that? Why would anyonewant to release a dangerous wild animal from its cage?\"\"I don\u0027t know. Can anyone fathom the workings of adrunken man\u0027s mind? All I can tell you is what happened. Theanimals were out of their cages.\"Mr. Okamoto: \"Excuse me. You have doubts about thefitness of the crew?\"\"Grave doubts.\"\"Did you witness any of the officers being under theinfluence of alcohol?\"\"No.\"\"But you saw some of the crew being under the influence ofalcohol?\"\"Yes.\"\"Did the officers act in what seemed to you a competentand professional manner?\"\"They had little to do with us. They never came close to theanimals.\"\"I mean in terms of running the ship.\"\"How should I know? Do you think we had tea with themevery day? They spoke English, but they were no better thanthe crew. They made us feel unwelcome in the common roomand hardly said a word to us during meals. They went on inJapanese, as if we weren\u0027t there. We were just a lowly Indianfamily with a bothersome cargo. We ended up eating on ourown in Father and Mother\u0027s cabin. ‘Adventure beckons!\u0027 saidRavi. That\u0027s what made it tolerable, our sense of adventure. Wespent most of our time shovelling excrement and rinsing cagesand giving feed while Father played the vet. So long as theanimals were all right, we were all right. I don\u0027t know if theofficers were competent.\"\"You said the ship was listing to port?\"\"Yes.\"\"And that there was an incline from bow to stern?\"\"Yes.\"\"So the ship sank stern first?\"\"Yes.\"\"Not bow first?\" . \"No.\"\"You are sure? There was a slope from the front of theship to the back?\"\"Yes.\"\"Did the ship hit another ship?\"\"I didn\u0027t see another ship.\"\"Did it hit any other object?\"\"Not that I saw.\"\"Did it run aground?\"\"No, it sank out of sight.\"\"You were not aware of mechanical problems after leavingManila?\"\"No.\"\"Did it appear to you that the ship was properly loaded?\"\"It was my first time on a ship. I don\u0027t know what aproperly loaded ship should look like.\"\"You believe you heard an explosion?\"\"Yes.\"\"Any other noises?\"\"A thousand.\"\"I mean that might explain the sinking.\"\"No.\"\"You said the ship sank quickly.\"\"Yes.\"\"Can you estimate how long it took?\"\"It\u0027s hard to say. Very quickly. I would think less thantwenty minutes.\"\"And there was a lot of debris?\"\"Yes.\"\"Was the ship struck by a freak wave?\"\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\"But there was a storm?\"\"The sea looked rough to me. There was wind and rain.\"\"How high were the waves?\"\"High. Twenty-five, thirty feet.\"\"That\u0027s quite modest, actually.\"\"Not when you\u0027re in a lifeboat.\"\"Yes, of course. But for a cargo ship.\"\"Maybe they were higher. I don\u0027t know. The weather wasbad enough to scare me witless, that\u0027s all I know for sure.\"\"You said the weather improved quickly. The ship sank andright after it was a beautiful day, isn\u0027t that what you said?\"\"Yes.\"\"Sounds like no more than a passing squall.\"\"It sank the ship.\"\"That\u0027s what we\u0027re wondering.\"\"My whole family died.\"\"We\u0027re sorry about that.\"\"Not as much as I am.\"\"So what happened, Mr. Patel? We\u0027re puzzled. Everythingwas normal and then…?\"\"Then normal sank.\"\"Why?\"\"I don\u0027t know. You should be telling me. You\u0027re the experts. Apply your science.\"\"We don\u0027t understand.\"[Long silence] Mr. Chiba: [translation] \"Now what?\"Mr. Okamoto: \"We give up. The explanation for tke sinkingof the tsimtsum is at the bottom of the Pacific.\"[Long silence] Mr. Okamoto: \"Yes, that\u0027s it. Let\u0027s go. [/translation] Well,Mr. Patel, I think we have all we need. We thank you verymuch for your cooperation. You\u0027ve been very, very helpful.\"\"You\u0027re welcome. But before you go, I\u0027d like to ask yousomething.\"\"Yes?\"\"The Tsimtsum sank on July 2nd, 1977.\"\"Yes.\"\"And I arrived on the coast of Mexico, the sole humansurvivor of the Tsimtsum, on February 14th, 1978.\"\"That\u0027s right.\"\"I told you two stories that account for the 227 days inbetween.\"\"Yes, you did.\"\"Neither explains the sinking of the Tsimtsum.\"\"That\u0027s right.\"\"Neither makes a factual difference to you.\"\"That\u0027s true.\"\"You can\u0027t prove which story is true and which is not. Youmust take my word for it.\"\"I guess so.\"\"In both stories the ship sinks, my entire family dies, and Isuffer.\"\"Yes, that\u0027s true.\"\"So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you andyou can\u0027t prove the question either way, which story do youprefer? Which is the better story, the story with animals or thestory without animals?\"Mr. Okamoto: \"That\u0027s an interesting question…\"Mr. Chiba: \"The story with animals.\"Mr. Okamoto: [translation] \"Yes. [/translation] The storywith animals is the better story.\"Pi Patel: \"Thank you. And so it goes with God.\"[Silence] Mr. Okamoto: \"You\u0027re welcome.\"Mr. Chiba: [translation] \"What did he just say?\"Mr. Okamoto: \"I don\u0027t know.\"Mr. Chiba: \"Ok look – he\u0027s crying.\" [/translation] [Long silence] Mr. Okamoto: \"We\u0027ll be careful when we drive away.

And we\u0027re really very sorry aboutwhat happened to you.\"\"Thank you.\"\"What will you be doing now?\"\"I guess I\u0027ll go to Canada.\"\"Not back to India?\"\"No. There\u0027s nothing there for me now. Only sad memories.\"\"Of course, you know you will be getting insurance money.\"\"Oh.\"\"Yes. Oika will be in touch with you.\"[Silence] Mr. Okamoto: \"We should be going.
