{"id":3156,"no":60,"title":"Chapter 60","content":"I awoke once during the night. I pushed the canopy asideand looked out. The moon was a sharply defined crescent andthe sky was perfectly clear. The stars shone with such fierce,contained brilliance that it seemed absurd to call the night dark. \n The sea lay quietly, bathed in a shy, light-footed light, adancing play of black and silver that extended without limits allabout me. The volume of things was confounding – the volumeof air above me, the volume of water around and beneath me. \n I was half-moved, half-terrified. I felt like the sage Markandeya,who fell out of Vishnu\u0027s mouth while Vishnu was sleeping andso beheld the entire universe, everything that there is. Beforethe sage could die of fright, Vishnu awoke and took him backinto his mouth. For the first time I noticed – as I would noticerepeatedly during my ordeal, between one throe of agony andthe next – that my suffering was taking place in a grandsetting. I saw my suffering for what it was, finite andinsignificant, and I was still. My suffering did not fit anywhere,I realized. And I could accept this. It was all right. (It wasdaylight that brought my protest: \"No! No! No! My sufferingdoes matter. I want to live! I can\u0027t help but mix my life withthat of the universe. Life is a peephole, a single tiny entry ontoa vastness – how can I not dwell on this brief, cramped viewI have of things? This peephole is all I\u0027ve got!\") I mumbledwords of Muslim prayer and went back to sleep. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1841/53409.html","bookId":122,"book":{"id":122,"title":"少年派的奇幻漂流 Life of Pi","description":"简介： 少年派遇到一次海难，家人全部丧生，他与一只孟加拉虎在救生小船上漂流了227天，人与虎建立起一种奇特的关系，并最终共同战胜困境获得重生。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/24/15-28-28-36-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1841","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
