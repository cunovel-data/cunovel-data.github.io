{"id":3170,"no":74,"title":"Chapter 74","content":"I practised religious rituals that I adapted to thecircumstances – solitary Masses without priests or consecratedCommunion hosts, darshans without murtis, and pujas withturtle meat for prasad, acts of devotion to Allah not knowingwhere Mecca was and getting my Arabic wrong. They broughtme comfort, that is certain. But it was hard, oh, it was hard. \n Faith in God is an opening up, a letting go, a deep trust, afree act of love – but sometimes it was so hard to love. \n Sometimes my heart was sinking so fast with anger, desolationand weariness, I was afraid it would sink to the very bottom ofthe Pacific and I would not be able to lift it back up. \n At such moments I tried to elevate myself. I would touch theturban I had made with the remnants of my shirt and I wouldsay aloud, \"THIS IS GOD\u0027S HAT!\"I would pat my pants and say aloud, \"THIS IS GOD\u0027SATTIRE!\"I would point to Richard Parker and say aloud, \"THIS ISGOD\u0027S CAT!\"I would point to the lifeboat and say aloud, \"THIS IS GOD\u0027SARK!\"I would spread my hands wide and say aloud, \"THESE AREGOD\u0027S WIDE ACRES!\"I would point at the sky and say aloud, \"THIS IS GOD\u0027SEAR!\"And in this way I would remind myself of creation and ofmy place in it. \n But God\u0027s hat was always unravelling. God\u0027s pants werefalling apart. God\u0027s cat was a constant danger. God\u0027s ark was ajail. God\u0027s wide acres were slowly killing me. God\u0027s ear didn\u0027tseem to be listening. \n Despair was a heavy blackness that let no light in or out. Itwas a hell beyond expression. I thank God it always passed. Aschool of fish appeared around the net or a knot cried out tobe reknotted. Or I thought of my family, of how they werespared this terrible agony. The blackness would stir andeventually go away, and God would remain, a shining point oflight in my heart. I would go on loving. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1841/53423.html","bookId":122,"book":{"id":122,"title":"少年派的奇幻漂流 Life of Pi","description":"简介： 少年派遇到一次海难，家人全部丧生，他与一只孟加拉虎在救生小船上漂流了227天，人与虎建立起一种奇特的关系，并最终共同战胜困境获得重生。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/24/15-28-28-36-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1841","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
