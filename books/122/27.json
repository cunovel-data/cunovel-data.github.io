You referred him to me,\"replied Mother. \n \"Did I?\"\"You did.\"\"I had a very busy day…\"\"You\u0027re not busy now. You\u0027re quite comfortably unemployedby the looks of it. If you want to march into his room andpull the prayer rug from under his feet and discuss thequestion of Christian baptism with him, please go ahead. Iwon\u0027t object.\"\"No, no.\" I could tell from his voice that Father was settlingdeeper into his chair. There was a pause. \n \"He seems to be attracting religions the way a dog attractsfleas,\" he pursued. \"I don\u0027t understand it. We\u0027re a modernIndian family; we live in a modern way; India is on the cuspof becoming a truly modern and advanced nation – and herewe\u0027ve produced a son who thinks he\u0027s the reincarnation of SriRamakrishna.\"\"If Mrs. Gandhi is what being modern and advanced isabout, I\u0027m not sure I like it,\" Mother said. \n \"Mrs. Gandhi will pass! Progress is unstoppable. It is adrumbeat to which we must all march. Technology helps andgood ideas spread – these are two laws of nature. If you don\u0027tlet technology help you, if you -resist good ideas, you condemnyourself to dinosaurhood! I am utterly convinced of this. Mrs. \n Gandhi and her foolishness will pass. The New India willcome.\"(Indeed she would pass. And the New India, or one familyof it, would decide to move to Canada.)Father went on: \"Did you hear when he said, ‘Bapu Gandhisaid, \"All religions are true\"\u0027?\"\"Yes.\"…\"Bapu Gandhi? The boy is getting to be on affectionateterms with Gandhi? After Daddy Gandhi, what next? UncleJesus? And what\u0027s this nonsense – has he really become aMuslim?\"\"It seems so.\"\"A Muslim! A devout Hindu, all right, I can understand. AChristian in addition, it\u0027s getting to be a bit strange, but I canstretch my mind. The Christians have been here for a longtime – Saint Thomas, Saint Francis Xavier, the missionaries andso on. We owe them good schools.\"\"Yes.\"\"So all that I can sort of accept. But Muslim? It\u0027s totallyforeign to our tradition. They\u0027re outsiders.\"\"They\u0027ve been here a very long time too. They\u0027re a hundredtimes more numerous than the Christians.\"\"That makes no difference. They\u0027re outsiders.\"\"Perhaps Piscine is marching to a different drumbeat ofprogress.\"\"You\u0027re defending the boy? You don\u0027t mind it that he\u0027sfancying himself a Muslim?\"\"What can we do, Santosh? He\u0027s taken it to heart, and it\u0027snot doing anyone any harm. Maybe it\u0027s just a phase. It toomay pass – like Mrs. Gandhi.\"\"Why can\u0027t he have the normal interests of a boy his age? \n Look at Ravi. All he can think about is cricket, movies andmusic.\"\"You think that\u0027s better?\"\"No, no. Oh, I don\u0027t know what to think. It\u0027s been a longday.\" He sighed. \"I wonder how far he\u0027ll go with theseinterests.\"Mother chuckled. \"Last week he finished a book called TheImitation of Christ.\"\"The Imitation of Christ! I say again, I wonder how farhe\u0027ll go with these interests!\" cried Father. \n They laughed. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1841/53345.html","bookId":122,"book":{"id":122,"title":"少年派的奇幻漂流 Life of Pi","description":"简介： 少年派遇到一次海难，家人全部丧生，他与一只孟加拉虎在救生小船上漂流了227天，人与虎建立起一种奇特的关系，并最终共同战胜困境获得重生。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/24/15-28-28-36-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1841","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
