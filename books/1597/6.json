My heart is my own, and I’m not looking to share it,” I said finally.\n I felt as if I was standing on a precipice, and I had to take a stand. I had sworn that no man was going to tell me what to do ever again, even if he was just telling me to love him in return.\n “Whatever you think I may eventually feel for you, for right now, you’re going to have to back off.”\n “I don’t like following orders,” he said quietly.\n “Neither do I,” I said.\n 5\n The flute song rose and fell between us, breaking the tension into ripples. I watched him shred the little web of grass he had woven. It fluttered away in the breeze.\n “It would appear we’ve reached an impasse,” he said.\n “So what now?”\n He tossed the last bit of grass to the ground and inspected his green-stained gloves, then shook himself like a dog. When he met my eyes again, the charged power of his gaze was gone, replaced by a mask of bright, manic energy. He leaped to his feet and did a strange little jig, then held out his hand with a flourish. A bouquet of flowers appeared there. When I reached to take it, it disappeared, and a little cloud of confetti burst from his sleeve and settled over me.\n I clapped slowly and sarcastically but couldn’t help grinning at him.\n “We go to Criminy’s Clockwork Caravan,” he said. “We’ll find some clothes for you, feed you, introduce you around. The crew’s about half Bludmen, half Pinky, so you’ll feel at home. And there’s a very strict order of things, in the caravan.”\n He smiled crookedly and held out his arm. “Your blood is safe with us.”\n I didn’t feel safe, neither in body nor in heart. Why was I drawn to this odd, inhuman man? I had felt his tug when I opened the locket, but I had thought it was fancy and romance, the impossible longing for something noble and beautiful from long ago. I thought it was the same sort of harmless yearning I felt for Mr. Darcy. But here, near him, smelling him, I recognized the feeling for what it was. Attraction. And passion. And maybe fear—the exciting kind.\n He was right, though. I had nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to. I found myself committing to the world of Sang, whether as a dream or as an alternative dimension. Maybe I had a head injury and was lying on my bathroom floor in a puddle of blood, dreaming strange dreams as Nana left message after frantic message on my voice mail.\n That thought made me shiver, and he turned to look at me.\n “All right, love? You look as if a goose has walked over your grave.”\n I tried to play it off as a joke. “You have geese here? Or are they bludgeese?”\n “Birds drinking blood?” He chuckled. “Do they have teeth where you come from? Because here, it’s just ruddy little beaks. I suppose they could peck you to death, if you held still long enough.”\n We had reached the caravan again, and I braced myself for further bewilderment. Everything seemed slightly off-kilter, and I was walking into an unfamiliar place full of strangers and people who wanted to drink my blood. Still, nothing moved except for tendrils of smoke on the breeze, and it was eerie. I could see the same monkey in the same fez, sitting perfectly still on the caboose. I was amazed that any animal could sit still that long.\n “What’s with the monkey?” I asked. “He must be really well trained.”\n “Well trained? Love, you’re a riot,” he said, laughing again. I was powerfully drawn to that laugh, and I barely even knew the man. Or inhuman monster. Or apex predator. Whatever he claimed to be.\n “Pemberly, wake!” he called.\n A flash of green light surged over the monkey’s open eyes, and they blinked several times. It leaped into the air and did a little jig on its back legs, its tail forming a perfect question mark.\n “Pemberly, come,” Criminy called, and the monkey swung down to the ground and ran to his outstretched arm, climbing up to sit on his shoulder, tail curling around his bicep.\n The monkey turned to look at me, and I realized that the coppery fur was actually cunningly crafted metal. I could hear a subtle ticking from within, and when the eyes blinked, there was a metallic click.\n “Letitia, my dear, this is Pemberly. Pemberly, this is your new mistress,” Criminy said. The monkey extended a dainty black paw, and Criminy nodded to me, saying, “Mustn’t be rude.”\n I shook the little hand, which was cold and smooth. The monkey’s mouth turned up at the corners in a comical grin, revealing silver teeth.\n “She likes you,” Criminy said.\n “How do you know it’s a she?” I said.\n “Because when Murdoch built her, I specifically requested a female,” he said, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.\n “Is she a pet or part of the caravan?” I asked.\n “Both, of course,” he said. “She’s whatever I need her to be.”\n “Where I come from, we don’t have anything like that.”\n “Well, we’re quite lucky to have an excellent builder and mechanic on staff. A Pinky and a hermit but quite talented. He keeps the clockworks running, although we’re having a spot of trouble lately with the Bolted Burlesque. The redhead keeps shorting out in the middle of a striptease, and then everyone wants their blood back.”\n “But … why?”\n “I expect a patron got too touchy,” he said with a shrug. “Happens.”\n “No, I mean … why don’t you have real animals? A real burlesque? This is a circus, right?”\n He sighed and chucked me under the chin, saying, “I already told you, pet. Almost all of the wild animals are blood drinkers, and no Pinky in her right mind would stand around in her skivvies. Can you imagine what a blood-hungry pachyderm could do to a fragile little body like yours? No one’s seen a living monkey in decades. And most of the city dogs and cats have been drained by blud-rats. The clockworks make good enough pets and guards.”\n “So that’s why she was holding so still,” I said.\n “Guard mode. Can’t be too safe, these days. I’ll have Murdoch build something lovely for you, don’t worry.”\n I looked up and down the caravan, hunting for the Bolted Burlesque, but no sexbots were cavorting in plain sight. We stood for a few heartbeats in front of the wagons, and I felt as if he was waiting for some sort of reaction from me. I honestly didn’t have one. He sighed and held out his hand to sling the monkey to the ground, saying, “Pemberly, guard.”\n She skittered back onto the caboose and sank down on her haunches as I had originally seen her, seemingly bored, her wide eyes gazing into the distance. A red light flashed intermittently in the irises.\n Beyond the metal monkey, the vast, hazy moors stretched, haunted and sad, to the horizon. I still hadn’t seen another person, except for the Coppers. Dream or not, it was unsettling.\n “Where is everyone?”\n “Oh, they’re having breakfast,” he said, checking a pocket watch. “Practice won’t begin until ten.”\n “What do they practice?” I asked. “I guess I don’t really understand what a caravan is. Or what this caravan is.”\n He let go of my hand and blocked my path.\n His lovely, lilting voice rose and took on the tones of an old-fashioned barker, and a cane somehow appeared in one hand, a top hat in the other. He grinned, and his pointed teeth glittered madly.\n “This, my lady, is a traveling circus. Death-defying acts, sideshow freaks, games of chance, and mystifying clockwork exhibitions to fool even the most steadfast Copper. Step right up! Test your mettle! See Veruca the amazing Abyssinian, Torno the strong man, and Herr Sigebert the juggling polanda bear!”\n The top hat flew up into the air, followed by the cane. In a motion so quick I barely saw it, he snatched a sneaky little rabbit from my feet and threw that into the air, too, juggling the three objects effortlessly, his manic eyes never leaving mine.\n Around and around, the hat chased the cane chased the hissing rabbit, in circles, then figure eights. Then the rabbit and the cane disappeared into the hat, which landed delicately on Criminy’s head. He wasn’t even winded, and his eyes were sparkling. I could tell that he loved performing, loved his art. I clapped in admiration.\n He cut a deep bow, and the rabbit fell out of the hat and squatted by his boots, stunned. He stomped on it with a sickening crunch, picked it up by the ears, and lobbed it under the caboose.\n “We make magic, you see. We’re the last of the gypsies, and we keep the world’s treasures safe in jars, masquerading as chicanery.”\n “You’re talking in puzzles,” I said.\n His energy faded to a thoughtful silence, and he bowed to me. “I do that, when I’m maudlin.”\n He led me to a shining wagon of deep burgundy. It reminded me of an old-fashioned Pullman car with brass fittings and hand-painted curlicues, but there were no windows.\n Criminy Stain, Gypsy King was painted along the side in ornate gold script.\n Underneath that, much smaller, it said, Specializing in all sorts of magic and legerdemain.\n “Impressive,” I said.\n “Ah, but we’re not going in there,” he said. “Not until you’ve got some clothes on. Like I said, respectable.”\n I rolled my eyes and tucked my arms into the armpits of the coat. It barely covered my important bits in front but overshot my back end by quite a bit. If I didn’t raise my arms, I could probably pass for respectable.\n We passed several other wagons.\n Torno the Strong Man.\n Abilene The Bearded Lady.\n Eblick the Lizard Boy.\n Catarrh and Quincy the Siamese Twins.\n I must remember not to make anyone angry, I thought. These people sound terrifying.\n The next wagon read, Costuming \u0026 Accounts, Carnivalleros Only.\n Underneath that, in tiny letters, it said, Or else.\n Or else? I took a step back.\n “Here we go, love,” Criminy said, and I stopped him with a hand on his arm before he could open the door. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wicked-as-they-come-blud-1/page-6.html","bookId":1597,"book":{"id":1597,"title":"Wicked as They Come (Blud #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Wicked as They Come (Blud #1) \n When nurse Tish Everett forced open the pesky but lovely locket she found at an estate sale, she had no idea she was answering the call of Criminy Stain, from the far off land of Sang.
