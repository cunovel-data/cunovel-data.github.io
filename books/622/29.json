{"id":34817,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX HOME AGAIN","content":"When Mrs. Harvey Middleton reached England she delayed but a day in London to attend to necessary business. This business was solely connected with her mission to America. Rudolph Rugg accompanied her to the chambers of a well-known lawyer, and testified to having had the charge of Tony, closing with the description of his death. Of course nothing was said of the well, or about his having thrown him in, for Rudolph was not a fool. The details of a probable story had been got up by Mrs. Middleton and Rugg in concert. According to them and the written testimony, Tony had been run over by a train on the Erie Railway, and a newspaper paragraph describing such an accident to an unknown boy was produced in corroboration. \n \n It was an ingenious fabrication, and Mrs. Middleton plumed herself upon it. \n \n Poor boy!” she said, with a hypocritical sigh, “his was a sad fate.” \n \n “It was, indeed,” said the lawyer; “but,” he added, dryly, “you have no cause to regret it, since it secures you the estate.” \n \n “Don’t mention it, Mr. Brief. It is sad to profit by such a tragedy.” \n \n “You don’t take a business view of it, madam. Such things happen, and if we can’t prevent them, we may as well profit by them.” \n \n “Of course I shall not refuse what has fallen in my way,” said Mrs. Middleton; “but I had formed the plan, if I found the boy alive, of bringing him home and educating him for his position. He would not have let me want.” \n \n “Don’t she do it well, though?” thought Rudolph, who heard all this with a cynical admiration for the ex-governess. “If I was a gentleman I’d make up to her, and make her Mrs. Rugg if she’d say the word.” \n \n “You think this man’s evidence will substantiate my claim to the estate?” she asked, after a pause. \n \n I should say there was no doubt on that point, unless, of course, his evidence is impeached or contradicted.” \n \n “That is hardly likely, Mr. Brief. The poor man suffered much at the death of the boy, to whom he was ardently attached.” \n \n “So you loved the boy, Mr. Rugg?” said the lawyer. \n \n Oh, uncommon!” answered Rudolph. “He was my pet, and the apple of my eye. We were always together, Tony and I.” \n \n “And I suppose he loved you?” \n \n “He couldn’t bear me out of his sight. He looked upon me as a father, sir.” \n \n “If he’d come into the estate he would probably have provided for you,” suggested the lawyer, watching him keenly. \n \n It’s likely, sir. I wish he had.” \n \n “So it is a personal loss to you—the death of the boy?” \n \n “Yes, sir.” \n \n “Mrs. Middleton probably will not forget your services to the boy.” \n \n “No, sir. I shall, of course, do something for Mr. Rugg, though, perhaps, not as much as my poor cousin would have done. Mr. Rugg, will you see me to my carriage?” \n \n “Certainly, ma’am.” \n \n Mrs. Middleton was anxious to go away. The conversation had taken a turn which she did not like. It almost seemed as if the lawyer were trying to find out something and she thought it best to get Rudolph away from the influence, lest Mr. Brief might catechise him and draw out something to her disadvantage. \n \n Mr. Rugg,” she said, as they were going downstairs, “I advise you not to go near Mr. Brief again.” \n \n “Why not, ma’am?” \n \n “These lawyers are crafty. Before you knew what he was after he would extract the secret from you, and there would be trouble for both of us.” \n \n “Do you think so, ma’am? I didn’t see nothing of it.” \n \n “I think he suspects something. That matters nothing, if it does not go beyond suspicion. Unless he can impeach your testimony or draw you into contradictions we are safe, and you are sure of an income for life.” \n \n “You needn’t be afraid for me, ma’am. We’re in the same boat.” \n \n She frowned a little at the familiar tone in which he spoke. It was as if he put himself on an equality with her. But it was true, nevertheless, and it was unpleasant for her to think of. \n \n Was there nothing else that was unpleasant? Did she not think of the poor boy, who, as she thought, was killed, and at her instigation? Yes, she thought of him, but as much as she could, she kept the subject away from her thoughts. \n \n He’s better off,” she said to herself. “He didn’t know anything of the property, and he wasn’t fit to possess it. All the troubles of life are over for him.” \n \n “What are your plans, Mr. Rugg?” she asked. \n \n I have a mind to go down to Middleton Hall with you, ma’am. I used to live there years ago, and I might find some of my old cronies.” \n \n “For that very reason you must not go,” she said, hastily. “They would be asking you all sorts of questions, and you’d be letting out something.” \n \n “They wouldn’t get nothing out of me.” \n \n “If you made no answer it would be as bad. They would suspect you.” \n \n “And you, too.” \n \n “Precisely.” \n \n “It’s rather hard, Mrs. Middleton, I can’t see my old friends.” \n \n “You can make new ones. A man with money can always find friends.” \n \n “That’s true, ma’am,” said Rudolph, brightening up. “Then you recommend me to stay in London.” \n \n “In London or anywhere else that you like better. Only don’t come within twenty miles of Middleton Hall.” \n \n “Well, ma’am, you’re wiser than I am, and you know better what it’s best to do.” \n \n “Of course I do. You are safe in being guided by me.” \n \n “But about the money, ma’am. How am I to get that if I don’t see you?” \n \n “Once a quarter I will pay in forty pounds to your account at any bank you choose. You can let me know.” \n \n “All right, ma’am. It’s strange to me to think of having a bank account.” \n \n “It need not be strange henceforth. And now, Mr. Rugg, we must part. I must hasten down to Middleton Hall to look after the estate. I have been absent from it now for nearly three months.” \n \n “I suppose you are in a hurry to see your young man?” said Rudolph, with a grin. \n \n Mr. Rugg,” said the lady, haughtily, “I beg you will make no reference to my private affairs. You speak as if I were a nursery maid.” \n \n “I beg your pardon, ma’am. No offense was meant.” \n \n “Then none is taken. But remember my caution.” \n \n She stepped into the hansom which was waiting for her, and Rudolph remained standing on the sidewalk. \n \n She’s puttin’ on airs,” said the tramp, frowning. “She forgets all about her bein’ a governess once without five pounds in the world. She acts as if she was a lady born. I don’t like it. She may try her airs on others, but not on Rudolph Rugg. He knows a little too much about you, Mrs. Harvey Middleton. Rich as you are, you’re in his power, and if he was so inclined, he could bring you down from your high place, so he could.” \n \n But Rudolph’s anger was only transient. He was too astute not to understand clearly that he could not harm Mrs. Middleton without harming himself quite as much. As things stood, he was securely provided for. No more tramping about the country for him in all weathers. He had enough to lodge and feed him, and provide all the beer and tobacco he could use. This was certainly a comfortable reflection. So he sought out a comfortable lodging and installed himself before night, determined to get what enjoyment he could out of London, and the income he had so foully won. \n \n And Mrs. Middleton, she, too, congratulated herself. \n \n She leaned back in the cab and gave herself up to joyful anticipations of future happiness and security. \n \n Thank Heaven! I have got rid of that low fellow,” she ejaculated, inwardly. “I never want to see the brute again. He was necessary to my purpose, and I employed him, but I should be glad if he would get drowned, or be run over, or end his miserable life in some way, so that I might never see or hear of him again.” \n \n But the thought of Rudolph did not long trouble her. She thought rather of handsome Capt. Lovell, whom she loved, and to marry whom she had committed this crime, and the hard woman’s face softened, and a smile crept over her face. \n \n I shall soon see him, my Gregory!” she murmured. “He will soon be mine, and I shall be repaid for my long, wearisome journey.” \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2019/57614.html","bookId":622,"book":{"id":622,"title":"Tony The Tramp;Or Right is Might","description":"简介： A man and a boy were ascending a steep street in a country town in eastern New York.
