I catch her watching me all the time—when I’m fixing myself a sandwich, when I’m cleaning, when I’m shopping—a secret smile touching her beautiful lips. When I ask her what’s up, she just shakes her head and says, “Kacey’s back.” And she’s happy.\\n\\n Storm and Dan are going strong. I think Storm might be in love, though she won’t admit to it for fear of jinxing it. I can tell that Dan is head over heels in love with her and with Mia by the way he watches them, a tiny smile always touching his lips. And Mia?\\n\\n Well, one morning, Trent and I wake up to Mia hovering over our bed with a gapped tooth grin and two quarters in the palm of her hand. “Look, Trent! I sold my teeth last night!” All I could do is laugh. Laugh and remind myself to get a lock for the door so Mia doesn’t learn more than cuss words from me. She’s the happiest kid I’ve ever seen because she’s surrounded by people who love her.\\n\\n True to Storm’s promise, I’m making more money at Penny’s than I could ever dream of making elsewhere. My bank statement grows considerably each week. Two more years of this, and I’ll be able to pay for Livie’s first year at Princeton. I’m still banking on that scholarship, which is a good possibility. Livie’s so smart and so good. And so deserving.\\n\\n Everything is perfect.\\n\\n “Why do we have to be at Penny’s three hours early?” I moan, pulling my jacket against my body as a light December chill breezes through my body. There’s an unnaturally cool weather front coming through Miami for this time of year, I hear. It’s still balmy compared to Michigan but, all the same, the goose bumps spike on my skin.\\n\\n “Liquor license training. We do it every two years. Anyone who serves needs to go through the course,” Storm explains.\\n\\n “Three hours of how to pour a drink? Seriously?”\\n\\n “Don’t worry,” she says as she bangs on Penny’s back door. “They let you sample too.”\\n\\n “Great. I’ll be slurring before our shift starts,” I grumble with a quick nod to Nate as I pass through. It’s dark and quiet inside. I’ve never been at Penny’s when it’s this quiet. “Where is everyone? This is creeping me out.”\\n\\n “By the bar,” Nate rumbles behind me, his hand prodding me forward. I peer over my shoulder and his mouth splits open to reveal gleaming white teeth. I can’t believe I used to be afraid of this giant teddy bear.\\n\\n We round the corner into the dimly lit main club area.\\n\\n “Surprise! Happy Birthday!”\\n\\n I jump back and slam into Nate, who wraps his trunk-of-an-arm loosely around me while his deep laughter reverberates off the ceiling. Everyone’s there, standing on the stage, under the spot lights. Trent, Livie, Dan, Cain, Ben. Even Tanner.\\n\\n And Mia! She’s off to the side, dancing around in circles with Ginger and a bunch of other fully-clothed dancers I don’t recognize.\\n\\n “Are you surprised?” Storm giggles as she grabs my arm and tugs me forward. “Livie told us you turn twenty-one soon and we wanted to surprise you. Cain offered to throw you a little party here.”\\n\\n As if on cue, Cain wanders over and tosses his arm over my shoulder. “Hope you’re okay with a birthday party at Penny’s. We figured this would be a guaranteed surprise.”\\n\\n I find myself struggling to speak, not sure how to respond as I take in the people. “Of course I am. Thank you.”\\n\\n He hands me an envelope. “Twenty-one only comes once, Sweetheart. You’re a hard worker and you take care of my Storm. Here’s a little something from everyone. Enjoy the food, the wine. Everything. Take the night off.” He pinches my cheek and then turns to Storm. “Keep that little princess of yours away from the stage, you hear me? Don’t want her getting any ideas.”\\n\\n She rolls her eyes. “Of course, Cain.”\\n\\n I shake my head as I watch him walk away. He’s an odd duck. Hearing him say that, given this place is his life, and he employs all these dancers to do just that—be on the stage—his words are just plain weird.\\n\\n That thought vanishes as I watch Trent find his way over to me with a seductive grin and two champagne flutes in his hands. “You know I don’t drink, Trent,” I say as I take one.\\n\\n “And you know I don’t drink, Kacey.”\\n\\n We smile at each other as he curls his free arm around my waist and pulls me into him, kissing my neck. “Has my plan worked? Have I made you happy?” he whispers into my ear.\\n\\n My breath hitches. It always does when Trent’s near. “I can’t even begin to describe how much.”\\n\\n His cool nose grazes my cheek. “Try.”\\n\\n “Well …” I lean forward, pressing myself against him. I don’t know how it’s possible, but those electric sparks zap me every time I do like it’s the first time. “Better yet, how about I show you when we get back home?”\\n\\n I feel his response to my implication dig into my stomach and I giggle, still in shock that this gorgeous, sweet, devilish guy is all mine. He clinks his glass against mine. “Here’s to the next eighty years,” he murmurs and then tips his glass back and takes a sip.\\n\\n “Eighty? God, you’re optimistic. I figured you’re good for another ten, and then I’ll have to trade you in for a younger model.”\\n\\n He leans down and kisses my mouth and I taste the champagne’s sweetness on his tongue. “Good luck with that. I’m not going anywhere.”\\n\\n My fingers weave together as I ride back with Trent, the evening breeze nipping at my cheeks. As tempted as I am to let my hands wander, I know better than to distract Trent while he’s driving. I can wait until we get home, but just barely. Livie and Mia are in Dan’s car, following behind us. Storm decided to work. She promised we’d do a girls’ day tomorrow.\\n\\n Trent parks the bike and I climb off. I don’t get very far though, before he grabs the front of my jeans at the zipper, and yanks me back to him. “Stay in or go out tonight?” His teeth lightly nip my neck.\\n\\n “How about both. First go out, and then stay in.”\\n\\n “That makes no sense.” The sound of his chuckle against my ear sends shivers through my body.\\n\\n I giggle. Then I shove him hard and he tumbles to the grass. I start running. “If you can catch me, you get to choose.” I manage to get the key into the lock before he reaches me. I’m running through the commons toward our apartments, squealing with anticipation, expecting to feel strong hands grab hold of me any second.\\n\\n When they don’t, I slow and glance back. Trent is standing in the middle of the commons, frozen, his face ashen like he’s seen a corpse.\\n\\n “Trent?” I walk back toward him. Following his riveted gaze, I discover an older well-dressed couple standing ten feet away, watching us. In my mad dash, I’d missed them earlier.\\n\\n The man’s appearance strikes me as familiar and I quickly realize what it is. He has Trent’s eyes and mouth. Looking to the woman, her hair pulled into a sophisticated bun, I recognize Trent’s narrow nose.\\n\\n “Trent, are these your parents?”\\n\\n No answer.\\n\\n I’ve secretly been dying to meet his parents. His father is a big shot lawyer in Manhattan; his mother runs a creative agency. She funnels a lot of contract work through to Trent. That’s how he gets his clients. I know that they’re divorced and yet here they are. Together. A spike of fear channels through me. There must be bad news if they travelled all the way here together. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ten-tiny-breaths-ten-tiny-breaths-1/page-48.html","bookId":1854,"book":{"id":1854,"title":"Ten Tiny Breaths (Ten Tiny Breaths #1)","description":"Storyline: Just breathe, Kacey.
