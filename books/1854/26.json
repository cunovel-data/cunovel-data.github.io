From behind his back, Trent produces a bunch of five pink roses. He kneels on one knee to present it to her. I hear the collective sigh from all the grown women in the group, including myself. “Thank you for inviting me,” he says. She clutches the flowers in both her tiny hands, and then gazes at Trent with wide, starry eyes that don’t blink for far too long. Her cheeks flush and I can tell this is the moment where Mia falls in love with him. This tall stranger has just become her life-long prince. The moment passes rapidly, and then she turns around and runs toward Storm. “Mommy! Mommy! Look what that man gave me!” Trent winks as he shuts the door behind him, closing the distance to where I’m standing. “You disappeared this morning,” he whispers. This is so awkward. Thanks, Storm. “I … I know … I’m …” I’m about to say I’m sorry, but he winks. “It’s okay. I figured it was all a bit too much, too fast.” One finger hooks into mine, buckling my knees with waves of excitement. I think I’m going to fall in love with this man. Trent’s gaze drifts over my outfit and I catch the heat in it. Probably the exact same heat as in mine when I look at him. “You look … nice.” We’re still staring awkwardly at each other, when Livie clears her throat. “Dinner’s ready.” Storm’s tiny apartment pulses with a warm current as the five of us devour Storm’s cooking. Somehow the snake fiasco comes up and I become the butt of everyone’s jokes. Even Mia joins in, nibbling on my shoulder like a mock- monster. Except she has no front teeth so it’s more like gumming. And through it all, I can’t help but constantly touch Trent’s face with my eyes to find his on mine just as frequently. By the time dinner is done, and we’re saying our good-byes so Storm and I can head off to work, every fiber of my being craves Trent and I have no interest in pretending otherwise. “Who’s Penny? Clearly someone important.” I gesture to the sign as we pull up in front of the club. Storm’s fingers tap her steering wheel and her perma-smile falters. “Penny was a really nice girl who met a really bad guy.” She turns to look at me. “Five years ago, Cain ran a club downtown. It was a dive compared to this place. Penny was his star attraction. I hear she brought guys in from all over the state and into Alabama. She started dating this guy, and things got serious. He proposed. Everyone was happy for her. He’d come watch her dance sometimes. He’d give her little kisses and hugs throughout the night. Watch over her a bit. You know, really sweet stuff. Of course, he said once they were married, she’d have to quit. She was fine with that.” Storm’s voice turns somber. “One night, something happened. No one knows what exactly. One second this guy has his arm around Penny, the next, he’s dragging her to the backroom by her throat. Nate couldn’t get there in time. He found her on the ground with a cracked skull.” I clutch my throat. “I know. Terrible, right? Cain shut down that place. There was a whole murder investigation. He bought this location and opened under the new name, in honor of her.” We exit the car and head toward the back door. “That’s why the bouncers are so strict about patrons touching the staff. It doesn’t matter if the guy’s your husband. If he touches you, he’s out. More than once, and he’s barred for life.” “Huh …” My thoughts drift back to last night, when Nate kicked Trent out for holding my hand. I thought he was being an ass**le. Now, I want to hug him. Or a part of him, given I’d need a ladder and extendable arms to get around his mammoth size. I follow Storm’s black-clad form to the door. Just before she knocks, she turns and smiles, like she can read my mind. “They’re genuinely good guys, Kacey. I know it’s hard to believe, but it’s true. Cain’s been nothing but amazing with me. He lets me bartend, he set the stage and equipment up for me to do my act once in a while, and that’s all. No rounds, no lap dances, no private stuff. The bouncers collect my tips from my show so I don’t have to crawl around on the ground, collecting it myself. They’ll take care of you. You’ll see.” When Trent shows up at half past eleven and takes a seat at the bar, my brain instantly scatters. The fact that I slept in his bed last night, and had dinner with him earlier doesn’t help me relax around him. I think it’s actually made me more nervous. One … two … three …Ugh! As usual, my mother’s advice doesn’t help. I stroll over, trying to regulate my heart rate as I take in his beautiful features. They really are beautiful. He could grace the cover of any magazine. And that mouth … I bite my lip, trying not to get all flustered. “Triple scotch on the rocks?” I quirk my brow. He flashes those disarming dimples at me. “Hold the scotch and add some soda to the rocks, and you’ve got a deal.” I smile as I throw together his drink, and slide it toward him, our fingertips brushing for a millisecond. With a nervous glance over at Nate, I see his focus elsewhere, and I sigh in relief. “Don’t worry, I know the rules at these places.” “Frequent much?” I ask dryly. He shakes his head with a wry grin. “Standard protocol. Some places are more strict than others, but they’re all the same. I have no interest in getting kicked out again. Once was enough.” I feel a twinge of guilt over that, knowing it was my fault. Trent’s wink dissolves it instantly. I want to stay and talk to him but there’s a gaggle of customers waiting. I’m forced to leave him with a disappointed shrug. I spend the next hour pouring drinks for customers while my nerves prickle under Trent’s undivided attention. “Too bad it’s so busy here,” he says when I get back to where he’s sitting. “Yeah well, some of us have to work to survive,” I quip and I realize I have no clue what he does. I know nothing about him. “And when are you off next?” he asks casually, sliding a coaster around under his index finger. “Monday.” Trent gets to his feet and throws a twenty on the counter. “So you’re free Monday night, say around five?” “Maybe.” His grin widens. “Great.” With a wink, he turns around. I watch him leave the bar, frustration that he’s gone weighing me down. Storm leans in. “What was that about?” I shrug, the lingering feel of his eyes still on my body. “I’m not sure. I think he just asked me on a date.” A rush of adrenaline bursts through me. That sure as hell better be what he just did or I’m going to lose my shit tomorrow. Storm gives my shoulder an affectionate squeeze, and I don’t flinch. I smile at her. I smile at the guy across the bar, waiting for his drink. Heck, I even give Nate a goofy wide grin. I’m not sure, but I think I catch the corner of his mouth twitch upward for a second. I feel like a lightning bolt struck me the second I wake up Monday morning. Not because I had another nightmare. Because I didn’t. That never happens. In the last four years, that has never happened. I don’t know what to make of it, but I feel … free.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ten-tiny-breaths-ten-tiny-breaths-1/page-26.html","bookId":1854,"book":{"id":1854,"title":"Ten Tiny Breaths (Ten Tiny Breaths #1)","description":"Storyline: Just breathe, Kacey.
