{"id":79657,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"And then I remember that I have a date tonight with Trent. All else is forgotten. “Nice nails,” Livie notices two seconds after stepping through the door. She drops her backpack on the couch, her eyes widening with surprise for just a second. I spread my fingers out in front of me, admiring the black polish. “Where’d you get that done?” Her voice is slightly higher than normal and she’s trying not to make a big deal, I can tell. But it is a big deal. Today, I let a complete stranger touch my hands. And I didn’t flinch. It’s like Trent has broken my curse. “A spa down the street. They have a two-for-one manicure special on Thursdays. We should go together next time.” “Uh huh, and what’s the occasion?” Livie strolls toward the cupboard to grab a glass, pacing her steps as if she’s a bridesmaid walking down a church aisle. I want to laugh. She’s trying so hard not to freak out. “Oh, nothing.” I wait until she tips the Brita to her glass “I’m going out with Trent tonight.” Her head shoots up to meet me and she misses the cup, spilling water all over the floor. “Like … on a date?” I tuck my hair behind my ear. “Maybe. I guess you could …” Livie’s irises flash with delight. “Where are you guys going?” I shrug. “Probably the beach. Isn’t that what people do on first dates?” I have no idea. It’s been so long since I’ve done anything remotely date-like. There’s a long pause as Livie’s thoughts wander somewhere, likely trying to process this new Kacey, the one who goes on dates and gets manicures. And cares. “You know, we don’t know much about Trent, do we?” Her head tilts to the side curiously. “What does he do for a living?” I shrug. “No idea.” A darkness passes over Livie’s pretty face. I wait patiently for her to bite her lip for all of two seconds before she blurts out, “what if he’s a psychopath who tries to stuff kittens in ATMs?” “A hot psychopath,” I correct her and she scowls at me. “Come on, Livie. I didn’t get you away from Darla soon enough.” “Maybe you should find out more about Trent before agreeing to go out with him.” “I didn’t agree to go out with him.” “What?” She pauses. “Well then …” I cut her off. “We know nothing about each other. More importantly, he knows nothing about me. Just the way I like it.” Her lips press together tightly. “Oh, Livie, stop acting like the mature one here.” “Someone needs to.” She stoops to wipe the water with a dish towel. “I’ll be at Storm’s for dinner. Can you at least phone her later to let us know he didn’t stuff you into an ATM? And we need to get cell phones if you’re going to start going out with strange men.” I chuckle and nod. She stops and appraises me again with a small smile. “It’s nice to see you like this … again. What time do you think you’ll be home?” I wink. “Oh, Kacey.” she mutters, tossing the dish towel into the sink. By the time five rolls around, I’m pacing in my living room like a caged bear, counting to ten under my breath, over and over. Waves of excitement, nervousness, and fear chuck my insides back and forth, until I’m sure I’ll toss the contents of my lunch onto the hideous carpet. Right on cue, a soft knock sounds on the door. I open it to find Trent standing outside in jeans and a blue and white checkered shirt and aviator sunglasses, leaning against the door frame with one arm above his head. My entire body breaks out in a light sweat. “Nice door,” he says, sliding off his sunglasses. I catch myself staring into those gorgeous blue irises a tad too long before I make a sound. He’s being playful. I like playful. “Thanks. It’s new. We had to replace it after a crazed maniac busted through.” I smirk, proud of myself for managing that, even in Trent’s intensely hot presence. He laughs as he reaches in to hook his index finger around mine. Electricity streams through my limbs with that small amount of contact. He pulls me out into the open, into his chest, so that he towers over me, and I have to tilt my head back to meet his face. “I heard about that. Terrible situation. Did they finally catch that madman?” he murmurs, smirking. I pause to inhale. He smells likes the ocean and the woods. And raw desire. “The last I heard he was lurking around a gentleman’s establishment. Clearly he has deep-seeded issues. I think they’re closing in.” I add breathlessly, “I think they’ll catch him tonight.” Trent’s head tips back and he laughs. “Maybe they will.” He drapes his arm around my shoulder as he leads me out toward the parking lot. “That color looks incredible on you,” he says, gazing down at my emerald green shirt, . “Compliments your hair nicely.” “Thanks.” I smile, silently praising myself for buying it today, for the very reason that I know it looks nice against my dark red hair and ivory skin. People think I dye my hair to make it so dark and rich, but I don’t. That’s one way in which I’m lucky, I guess. Trent leads me to a red and orange Harley in the parking lot. “Have you ever ridden on one of these?” He holds out a helmet. So Trent’s a bike guy. Inspecting the thing, I’m not sure how I feel about that. I think he may have just climbed a few notches in the hot bad boy department. I shake my head as I look down at the bike with hesitation. “Not a lot of protection between me and three tons of moving metal when I’m on this,” I say. Who am I kidding? I’m not safe riding in three tons of metal. I’ve learned that firsthand. A gentle fingertip pushes my chin up until I’m looking at Trent’s earnest eyes. “I’ll keep you safe, Kacey. Just hold on to me. Tight.” I let him place the helmet on my head and gently fasten the strap around my chin, his deft fingers brushing my skin in a way that sends shivers through my body. A ghost of a smile passes his lips. “Or are you too scared?” Now he’s challenging me. Like he knows I’ll react to that. I can’t help but react. I’m like one of those idiots in the movies who slams on their gas pedal and attempts to sail over a two hundred foot gap in the road because someone said the word dare. My dad got hours of entertainment at my expense for that reason. “I’m not scared of anything,” I lie smoothly. I climb on behind Trent and shimmy up until my thighs hug either side of his hips. Heat explodes through the lower half of my body, but I do my best to ignore it, wrapping my arms around his torso. “Nothing, at all? Not even a bit nervous?” his brow quirks as he glances over his shoulder at me. “It’s okay. You can admit it. Most girls are nervous about riding on bikes.” A flash of jealousy sparks inside of me at the thought of him with another girl. I quickly quell it. “Do I seem like most girls?” My hands slide around his chest, running along the contours of his body, my fingers slipping through the seam of his shirt to graze the smooth ridges of his muscles underneath. For added effect, I lean forward and press my teeth against his shoulder. Trent’s chest rises with a quick inhale as his hands lift to grab mine and pull them out, placing them with a pat on the outside of his shirt. “Okay, you win. But don’t do that while I’m driving or we’ll end up in a ditch.” He looks over his shoulder again, adding in a soft, solemn tone, “I’m serious, Kacey. I can’t handle it.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ten-tiny-breaths-ten-tiny-breaths-1/page-27.html","bookId":1854,"book":{"id":1854,"title":"Ten Tiny Breaths (Ten Tiny Breaths #1)","description":"Storyline: Just breathe, Kacey.
