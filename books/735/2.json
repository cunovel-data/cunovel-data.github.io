{"id":40856,"no":2,"title":"BY WAY OF EXPLANATION","content":"The sole object of the following chapters is to tell a young man what is likely to happen to him if he goes into the newspaper business. \\n\\n \\n\\n Many young men think of entering journalism, but journalism is to them a maze of mystery. What does it offer as a profession or a vocation? they ask. What is the nature of the business? What are its rewards? Naturally enough they continue to wonder what kind of preparatory study is desirable. How does a young man make a beginning and how does the beginner make progress? What are the recognized standards of newspaper success? How is news collected and prepared for the public? How is a newspaper conducted? What are the duties of each member of a big newspaper staff? What goes on in a newspaper office, anyway? \\n\\n \\n\\n The book was begun with the intention of answering some of these queries, but it gradually drifted into talk about various phases and features of the business. The original intention has not been lost sight of, however. The purpose is to indicate what journalism offers to a young man as a means of livelihood. It seeks neither to glorify nor to disparage the newspaper. \\n\\n \\n\\n The book is elementary: not intended or expected to interest or inform newspaper editors of experience. \\n\\n C. S.
