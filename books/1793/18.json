He did not open his eyes. \"Dad?\"\\n\\n \"Time to go home.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t make her mad, did you?\"\\n\\n \"I worked very hard not to make her mad.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\" Carson went back to sleep.\\n\\n They all trooped down the hall to the front door and out onto the wide veranda. Winston vanished discreetly into the bushes. Hannah arranged Carson\u0027s black wind-breaker—a miniature version of the one Nick wore—around the boy\u0027s sleeping form.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got some news,\" she said softly.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" Nick asked.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re pregnant.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, that\u0027s great.\" He grinned and kissed her lightly on the forehead. \"Congratulations to both of you.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n Rafe put his arm around Hannah and pulled her close against his side. His pride and happiness were apparent. \"You\u0027re the first to know. We\u0027ll start phoning everyone else in both families tomorrow.\"\\n\\n Nick smiled. \"Nothing else like it, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, sorta figured that,\" Rafe said.\\n\\n Nick looked down at Carson lying securely in his arms. \"You just wish it was this easy to protect them forever.\"\\n\\n They stood there for a moment. No one spoke.\\n\\n After a while Nick hugged his son a little more tightly to him and went down the steps. At the bottom he paused briefly and looked back. \"Almost forgot. I\u0027ve got a little news of my own.\"\\n\\n Hannah smiled encouragingly. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Octavia Brightwell is related to our own local legend, Claudia Banner. Turns out that Claudia was her great-aunt.\"\\n\\n Hannah\u0027s jaw dropped. \"You\u0027re kidding.\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell is she doing here in Eclipse Bay?\" Rafe asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think she knows the answer to that one, herself. She said something about coming here to see if there was anything that could be done to mend the damage her great-aunt did. But I\u0027ve got a feeling it\u0027s more complicated.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" Hannah replied.\\n\\n \"From what I can tell, she\u0027s been drifting since Claudia died a year and a half ago. No close family. No real roots anywhere. Coming here to repair the damage her aunt did gave her a goal. But she tells me that she plans to leave at the end of the summer because it\u0027s clear to her that the Hartes and the Madisons have ended the feud all by themselves.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, the good times never last, do they?\" Rafe said laconically. His expression turned serious. \"Does my grandfather know who she is?\"\\n\\n \"She said Sullivan and Mitchell have known since the night of Lillian\u0027s show. Obviously they chose to keep the information to themselves.\"\\n\\n \"Figures,\" Rafe said.\\n\\n They waited together on the veranda while Winston finished his business in the damp shrubbery. Hannah watched the BMW disappear into the night.\\n\\n \"What do you think is going on here?\" she said after a while.\\n\\n \"Damned if I know.\" Rafe wrapped his hands around the railing. \"Maybe it\u0027s like Nick said. Maybe Octavia came to Eclipse Bay to carry out her aunt\u0027s dying wish and then discovered there was nothing to fix.\"\\n\\n \"Nick is getting serious about her. I can tell. Octavia is different from the other women he\u0027s been seeing in the past few years. He\u0027s acting odd, too. I wonder if he\u0027s given her The Talk yet?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know about that, but one thing we can say for sure. The curse has not yet been lifted. Nick didn\u0027t stay the night at her place.\"\\n\\n \"That business about the curse is absolute nonsense. The reason Nick never spends the night with any of his lady friends is because of Carson. He doesn\u0027t like to leave him alone with a sitter all night.\"\\n\\n \"That excuse doesn\u0027t fly,\" Rafe said flatly. \"It\u0027s true that Nick doesn\u0027t leave Carson with sitters all night, but you know as well as I do that the kid stays overnight with family at times. Trust me, Nick wouldn\u0027t have a serious problem arranging to remain in some woman\u0027s bed until breakfast if that\u0027s what he wanted to do. If you ask me, he\u0027s avoiding it.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose you\u0027re right. Waking up with someone in the morning is a little different. More intimate, somehow. He\u0027s probably afraid that if he spends the night, the lady in question might get the wrong idea in spite of The Talk. He\u0027s done his best to avoid getting entangled in a real relationship since Amelia died.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s one thing to have hot sex and leave while it\u0027s still dark,\" Rafe agreed. \"It\u0027s another thing to face the lady across the breakfast table. Takes the relationship to a whole new level.\"\\n\\n Hannah smiled and patted her tummy. \"Certainly had that effect on our relationship. But then, you can cook. That made a huge difference.\"\\n\\n Winston trotted up the steps and kept going toward the front door. Rafe turned his head to watch the dog disappear inside the hall.\\n\\n \"Uh-oh,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Something wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Just realized that we left the door open.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So Eddie is still at the front desk. He must have over-heard everything we said when we talked to Nick a few minutes ago. Got a feeling he now knows just who Octavia Brightwell really is. Probably can\u0027t wait to tell everyone down at the post office first thing tomorrow morning.\"\\n\\n Hannah groaned. \"You\u0027re right. Uh-oh.\"\\n\\n \"What the heck. It was all bound to come out sooner or later. Not like there\u0027s any way to keep a secret in Eclipse Bay, after all.\"\\n\\n \"True.\" Hannah nibbled on her lower lip for a moment. \"All the same, I think I\u0027ll give Octavia a call first thing in the morning and warn her. She\u0027s an outsider. She won\u0027t be prepared for what she\u0027s going to walk into tomorrow.\"\\n\\n Rafe smiled. He said nothing.\\n\\n She raised her brows. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Just struck me that Octavia isn\u0027t that much of an outsider.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s related to Claudia Banner, remember?\" He tightened his arm around Hannah and steered her back toward the open door. \"Her family has been involved in this thing from the beginning. Just like us Madisons and Hartes.\"\\n\\n Chapter 7\\n\\n All eyes turned toward her when she walked into the Incandescent Body bakery shortly before nine the next morning. And just as quickly shifted away again.\\n\\n Even if Hannah had not been kind enough to give her a wake-up call and a warning, Octavia thought, she had been in Eclipse Bay long enough to know what this peculiar attention meant.\\n\\n There was fresh gossip going around and she was the focus of it.\\n\\n She had been well aware of what would happen if she accepted a date with Nick Harte, she reminded herself. And the fact that everyone now knew that she was related to the infamous Claudia Banner just added a whole lot of very hot spice to the stew that was now brewing in Eclipse Bay. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-18.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
