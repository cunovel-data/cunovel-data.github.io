{"id":79192,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\"What was it doing in her gallery? Never mind. I assume she notified Valentine?\" \"Sure. But he\u0027s got his eye on the Heralds and she doesn\u0027t think he\u0027s looking in the right place. Neither does A.Z. or Virgil.\" \"So she hired Nick.\" Sullivan sank down onto the corner of his desk and digested that information. \"And he agreed to investigate?\" \"Appears that way.\" \"This is bizarre.\" \"Like I said, we\u0027ve got a situation here, Sullivan. I hate to admit it, but I think I\u0027m gonna need some help straightening this one out.\" \"Now, just a minuteâ€” \"I\u0027ll keep you posted.\" Mitchell cut the connection. Very slowly Sullivan reached across the desk and punched in another, very familiar number. He needed advice from the one person whose insight he had come to trust the most over the years. His wife, Rachel, answered on the second ring. \"Something wrong?\" she asked. \"Why do you say that?\" he grumbled. \"Because it\u0027s the middle of the day and you\u0027re supposed to be deep into the intricacies of the merger of Harte Investments and Madison Commercial.\" He could hear birds. Somewhere in the background, water splashed. He knew that she was out by the pool of their desert home with his daughter-in-law, Elaine. The two women were holed up together in Phoenix, keeping each other company, while their menfolk worked the merger details with Gabe Madison. Sullivan summoned up a vision of Rachel in her swimsuit, her body sleek and wet. She was still the only woman for him, he thought. There had never been another since he had met her all those years ago in the wake of the financial disaster of Harte-Madison. He had been a driven man in those days, completely obsessed with the task of rebuilding his business empire. But he had learned the hard way that the great strength in the Harte genes was also a potentially devastating flaw. It was the nature of a Harte to be goal-oriented and so focused that other things, important things, sometimes got pushed aside. If Madisons were driven by their passions, Hartes were sometimes inclined to be cold-blooded and relentless in their pursuit of an objective. Rachel had quietly acted to counter his single-minded obsession with Harte Investments. She had centered him, given him a sense of connection. During the long, hard years when he had thrown himself into the struggle to create H.I., Rachel had been there, sometimes going toe-to-toe with him to remind him that he had other priorities, too. It was Rachel who had taught him the meaning of family. It was Rachel who had saved him from going down a path that would have left him a hollow shell of a man. \"Gabe and Hamilton don\u0027t need my help,\" he said. \"They\u0027ve shunted me off to a corner office on the floor beneath the CEO\u0027s suite and made it clear they\u0027ll call me if they need me.\" \"I take it they don\u0027t call often?\" \"Nope. I\u0027m getting a little bored here, to tell you the truth. I\u0027m thinking of going over to the coast for a couple of days.\" \"What\u0027s wrong in Eclipse Bay?\" she asked instantly. \"Nothing\u0027s wrong.\" \"Nick and Carson are there.\" \"So? Thought I\u0027d spend a little time with my great-grandson. Carson\u0027s got a lot of me in him. Going to run an empire one of these days. He needs my guidance during his early, formative years.\" \"You still haven\u0027t told me what\u0027s wrong.\" The problem with being married to a woman like this for so many decades was that she could read a man\u0027s mind. \"Just had a call from Mitch,\" he said carefully. \"Seems like Nick and Octavia Brightwell are involved. Sort of.\" \"Well, well.\" \"What, exactly, does that mean?\" \"It means it\u0027s about time Nick finally got serious about a woman.\" \"That\u0027s the problem, according to Mitch,\" Sullivan said. \"He doesn\u0027t think Nick is serious about Octavia.\" \"Surely Nick wouldn\u0027t have an affair with her?\" Rachel sounded genuinely concerned now. \"Not there in Eclipse Bay. Think of the gossip.\" \"It\u0027s the thought of Mitch trying to manage the situation on his own that worries me.\" Chapter 12 \"Honest opinion, Octavia.\" Jeremy looked at the five pictures propped against the walls of the bedroom he was using as a studio. \"I can handle it. Really. I think.\" She gazed into the depths of the painting in front of her. It was a portrait of Jeremy\u0027s grandmother. It showed Edith Seaton seated in her antiques shop, a small, purposeful figure surrounded by the clutter of the past. There was an almost surrealistic quality to the old dishes and small relics housed in the glass cabinets and displayed on the tables. The painting showed a room crowded with a lifetime of memories. Edith\u0027s face was a rich tapestry of emotions and determination layered on each other with such a strong, clear vision that it was possible to see the personality of the woman in every stroke. \"It\u0027s really quite wonderful, Jeremy.\" She did not look up from the painting. \"When you said that you wanted to show me some pictures, I had no idea they would be of this quality.\" Jeremy visibly relaxed. He looked pleased. \"I did that one of my grandmother from a photo I took last year. You know, she\u0027s lived her whole life in this town. Hardly ever traveled even as far as Portland. Eclipse Bay is her whole world.\" \"How long has she been alone?\" \"Let\u0027s see, Granddad died eight, maybe nine years ago. That\u0027s him in the framed picture hanging behind the counter. They both grew up here. Got married the day after they graduated from high school. They were together for nearly sixty years.\" She studied the picture-within-a-picture and was able to make out the features of a man with the thin shoulders that often accompanied age. There was a certain self-confident, almost rakish quality to the tilt of the man\u0027s head. The viewer got the impression that at one time the senior Seaton had been a good-looking man and knew it. \"Sixty years is quite a marriage,\" she said. \"No one in my family ever managed to stay together that long.\" \"Mom told me once that Granddad ran around a bit in his younger days. But Grandmother pretended not to know about his little escapades.\" \"Your grandfather had his affairs right here in town?\" \"I guess so. He lived here all of his life and didn\u0027t do any traveling to speak of.\" She shuddered. \"Must have been hard on your grandmother.\" \"I\u0027m sure it was. She\u0027s got a lot of pride in the Seaton name.\" \"Marriages are always mysterious when viewed from the outside.\" She turned away from the painting. \"I\u0027d love to give you a show, Jeremy. But as I explained, to be important to your career, it would have to be held at the Portland gallery, not here in Eclipse Bay.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-35.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
