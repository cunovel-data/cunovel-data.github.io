I can see that you\u0027ve got something else on your mind.\"\n \"Eugene and Dwayne are not the sharpest knives in the drawer, if you know what I mean.\"\n \"I sort of got that impression. So?\"\n \"So, while they are both the type to spread false and malicious rumors, neither of them has the brainpower to concoct the one going around about you.\"\n She elevated her brows. \"I believe I see where you\u0027re going here.\"\n \"When you stop and think about it, that story Eugene and Dwayne were spreading about you is a fairly sophisticated piece of gossip. They gave you motive and opportunity and they\u0027ve added a few inside bits about how the art market works. Eugene even tried to use the word provenance.\"\n \"Not the sort of word you\u0027d expect a guy like him to have in his vocabulary.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"From what I\u0027ve heard about those two, they aren\u0027t likely to know much about the art market, either.\"\n \"Highly doubtful,\" he agreed.\n \"Which means that they are probably not the source of the rumors.\"\n \"Probably not.\"\n She was quiet for a moment. Her expression turned somber. \"What do you propose to do next?\"\n \"I\u0027m going to try to find out who started the gossip about you,\" he said. \"I figure whoever is responsible for the rumors might have had a motive for implicating you.\"\n \"Like, maybe, to cover up his own involvement in the theft of the painting?\"\n \"Yeah.\" He hesitated and then decided to give her the rest of it. \"There\u0027s something else that bothers me about that elaborate story, too.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"It would have been a lot simpler to point the finger of blame at the Heralds. They already seem a little suspicious to most folks. Instead, whoever concocted it chose you for the fall guy.\"\n \"You think this may be personal?\"\n \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I do. I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that someone isn\u0027t just looking for any scapegoat. Whoever took the painting wants to make you, in particular, look guilty.\" Chapter 15\n Anne came into the gallery with Gail the following morning. She clutched a carefully rolled-up sheet of drawing paper in both hands.\n \"I brought you my picture,\" Anne said in her whispery little voice. She held it out to Octavia.\n \"Thank you.\" Delighted, Octavia came around from behind the counter to take the rolled artwork. \"I\u0027m so glad that you decided to enter a drawing in the show, Anne.\"\n Before she could unroll the picture, Nick and Carson walked into the gallery. Nick carried a paper sack bearing the Incandescent Body logo. Carson had a cup of hot chocolate in one hand.\n \"Morning, Gail,\" Nick said. \"Hi, Anne.\"\n \"Hi,\" Gail replied. \"Say hello to Mr. Harte, Anne.\"\n \"Hello, Mr. Harte.\"\n \"This is Carson,\" Nick said.\n \"Hi,\" Carson said cheerfully. He looked at Anne and then at the rolled-up drawing in Octavia\u0027s hand. \"Is that your picture?\"\n \"Yes,\" she said.\n \"I did one, too. Miss Brightwell put mine in a gold frame.\" He looked at Octavia. \"We brought you some coffee and a muffin.\"\n \"Thanks,\" Octavia said. \"That sounds good.\"\n \"Let me see Anne\u0027s picture,\" Carson said.\n \"I was just about to look at it myself, and then Anne can select her frame.\"\n Octavia carefully unrolled the drawing and put it down on a low table. She looked at the picture, ready with admiring words. Then she took a second look, awed by the remarkable talent displayed in crayon.\n The form, color, shading, and expression were astounding, especially given the age of the artist. In some ways it was clearly a child\u0027s picture, but in others it vibrated with the raw power of a gifted and as yet untrained artist.\n \"Anne,\" she said very gently, \"this is a beautiful picture. Incredible.\"\n Anne looked thrilled. \"Do you really like it?\"\n Octavia took her gaze off the picture with some reluctance and looked at her. \"Yes.\" She caught Gail\u0027s attention. \"It is quite remarkable, to be honest.\"\n \"I told you she was good,\" Gail said with quiet pride.\n \"Brilliant is more like it,\" Octavia murmured.\n Carson was alarmed now. \"Let me see.\" He hurried closer and examined the picture with an expression of mounting outrage. \"It\u0027s a dog.\"\n \"It\u0027s Zeb,\" Anne told him. \"He\u0027s my dog. Well, partly mine. He belongs to Grandpa, but Grandpa says I can share him.\"\n Carson rounded on her. \"You can\u0027t do a dog for the art show. I did Winston.\"\n \"Carson.\" Nick spoke quietly. \"That\u0027s enough.\"\n Carson turned to him. \"But, Dad she can\u0027t do a dog. I already did one.\"\n Anne started to look uncertain. She glanced from her mother to Octavia for reassurance and then glowered at Carson. \"Miss Brightwell said I could make any kind of picture I wanted.\"\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Octavia said calmly. \"No two dog pictures are the same, so we can have any number of them in the art show, just like we can have any number of house pictures and flower pictures.\"\n Carson was not appeased, but he obviously knew that he was fighting a losing battle. \"It\u0027s not fair.\"\n \"Take it easy, Carson,\" Nick said. \"You heard Miss Brightwell. No two dog pictures are the same, so there can be lots of them in the show.\"\n \"Each one is special,\" Octavia assured him. \"Each one is unique. Your picture of Winston doesn\u0027t look anything like Anne\u0027s picture of Zeb.\"\n Carson\u0027s face tightened but he did not argue further.\n Octavia smiled at Anne. \"Come with me and we\u0027ll pick out a frame for your picture of Zeb. You have a choice of black, red, or gold.\"\n Anne brightened instantly. \"I want a gold one, please.\"\n Carson clenched his hands into small fists at his sides.\n Nick took Carson out of the gallery. They went across the Street and walked out onto the pier.\n Nick stopped at the end and braced a foot on one of the wooden boards that formed the railing. He peeled the top off his cup of coffee.\n \"You want to tell me what\u0027s wrong?\" he asked.\n \"Nothing\u0027s wrong.\" Carson took a desultory swipe at one of the railing posts with the toe of his right running shoe. \"It\u0027s just not fair.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-44.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
