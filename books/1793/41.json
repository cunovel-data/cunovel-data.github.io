They both watched him, taunting challenge in their faces.\n \"Let me put it to you this way, gentlemen,\" Nick said coolly. \"If you two cannot manage to refrain from further public comment on either Ms. Brightwell\u0027s personal or professional reputation, I have two words of wisdom for you.\"\n \"What two words?\" Eugene demanded, looking ready to pounce in victory.\n \"Lavender and Leather.\"\n Eugene\u0027s face went slack as if he\u0027d just gone completely numb. Maybe he had, Nick thought. With shock.\n Dwayne gaped. He looked frozen with horror.\n Satisfied that he had made his point, Nick turned and walked through the shadowy tavern. He pushed open the door and went out into the sparkling sunlight.\n And immediately collided with Octavia, who had just put her hand on the door to open it.\n \"Excuse me, I—\" She began, stepping hurriedly back out of the way. Then she recognized him. \"Oh, it\u0027s you.\"\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s me.\"\n The transition from night to day dazzled his vision. Or maybe it was the sight of Octavia in a dress that was roughly the color of a tequila sunrise and was splattered with impossibly oversized orchids. He took his sunglasses out of his pocket and put them on.\n She glanced past him toward the door of the tavern. \"What happened in there?\"\n \"I confirmed something that I have long suspected.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"No one in this town reads my books.\"\n Chapter 14\n \"I read them,\" she said.\n \"You don\u0027t count. You\u0027re leaving town in a few weeks, remember?\" He took her arm and steered her away from the entrance. \"What the hell are you doing here? I hope you weren\u0027t planning to eat lunch at the Total Eclipse. You weren\u0027t raised in Eclipse Bay, so you probably lack the necessary immunity to survive Fred\u0027s cooking.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t planning to eat there. I saw you go inside and I knew you had probably gone in to talk to someone about the painting.\"\n \"Brilliant deduction.\" Across the street, Sandy Hickson was watching them with great interest, a dripping squeegee dangling absently from one hand. Nick took Octavia\u0027s arm again. \"Come on, let\u0027s get you out of here. There\u0027s enough talk about you going around as it is.\"\n She skipped a little to keep up with him. \"Did you learn anything in the Total Eclipse?\"\n \"Always something to be learned in the Total Eclipse.\" he said flatly. \"It is never less than an enlightening experience.\"\n She frowned. \"What happened in there?\"\n \"Long story.\"\n \"It\u0027s lunchtime. Why don\u0027t we go somewhere and you can tell me this long story.\"\n He looked at her.\n \"You know,\" she said with a determinedly bright smile. \"You can give me a report.\"\n A report, he thought. First he was therapy and now he was business. This relationship was not improving. On the contrary, it seemed to be going sideways. But an invitation to lunch counted for something.\n \"Okay,\" he said. \"But you\u0027re the client, so you\u0027re buying.\"\n She flushed a little and did not seem amused. \"Certainly. Where shall we go?\"\n \"I assume you have to get back to the gallery right away. We can grab a bite at the Incandescent Body.\"\n \"Well, actually, no, I don\u0027t have to get back to the gallery right away,\" she said smoothly. \"I just hired an assistant for the summer. Gail Gillingham. She said she could handle the place for the afternoon.\"\n \"Gail?\" He thought about that. \"Good choice.\"\n \"I think so. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t offer her anything permanent, but she said that the position will give her some breathing space in which to hunt for a better situation. You know what they say, the best time to look for a job is when you\u0027ve already got one.\"\n \"Yeah, I\u0027ve heard that.\" He kept his grip on her arm and angled her across Bay Street, steering toward the gas station, where his car was still parked at the pump.\n \"Gail has a very professional attitude and she\u0027s smart.\"\n Octavia said, trotting briskly along beside him. \"I think that eventually she\u0027ll turn up something at the institute or at Chamberlain.\"\n \"Probably.\"\n Octavia finally noticed that they were halfway across the street. She frowned. \"Where are we going?\"\n \"To get my car.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n When they reached the BMW, Nick opened the door on the passenger side and stuffed Octavia into the seat. He closed the door and reached for his wallet.\n \"What do I owe you, Sandy?\"\n \"Twenty-three bucks.\" Sandy peered through the windshield, looking at Octavia. \"Everything go okay in the Total Eclipse?\"\n \"Sure.\" Nick handed him the cash and started toward the driver\u0027s side of the car. \"By the way, turns out Eugene and Dwayne were mistaken about that rumor they were spreading around.\"\n Sandy blinked. \"You mean the one about Miss—\" He broke off abruptly when Nick gave him a hard look. He swallowed heavily. \"Wrong, huh?\"\n \"Yeah.\" Nick opened the door. \"Completely false. Be a good idea if you didn\u0027t pass it along. Know what I mean?\"\n \"Right,\" Sandy said quickly and nodded. \"Big mistake.\"\n Nick got behind the wheel. \"You got it,\" he said through the open window. \"Big mistake.\"\n He drove out of the station, aware that Octavia was watching him intently.\n \"What was that all about?\" she asked.\n \"Nothing important.\"\n \"Don\u0027t give me that. You deliberately intimidated Sandy Hickson. I want to know why.\"\n He turned the corner and drove up the street that led away from the waterfront. \"I didn\u0027t do a damn thing to Sandy.\"\n \"Yes, you did. I saw you. Something about the way you looked at him. I call that intimidation. Why did you do it?\"\n He contemplated that question for a while. Then he shrugged. \"Okay, you should probably know what\u0027s going on, seeing as how you\u0027re the client, and all.\"\n \"Absolutely.\" She put on her own dark glasses, settled back into her seat, and folded her arms beneath her br**sts. \"Talk.\"\n \"There\u0027s a rumor going around town that you\u0027re the one who swiped the Upsall.\"\n For a couple of seconds she did not move, just sat there gazing blankly through the windshield. Then she whipped around in the seat.\n \"Someone thinks I stole it?\"\n \"I picked up the story from Sandy. He said he got it from a couple of colorful types who hang out at the Total Eclipse—\"\n \"Mean Eugene and Dickhead Dwayne.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-41.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
