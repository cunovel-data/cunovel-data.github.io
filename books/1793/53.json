I\u0027m working on finding out who started those rumors that are circulating about Octavia.\" \"Oh, yes.\" Marjorie sounded nonplussed, as if she hadn\u0027t intended the conversation to go in this direction. \"Yes, I did hear that you were asking around about the painting. Uh, any luck yet?\" \"Yes, as a matter of fact. I\u0027m getting close.\" \"That\u0027s wonderful,\" Marjorie said vaguely. \"I\u0027m working on this theory, you see. I figure that when I find out who started the rumors, I\u0027ll have the thief.\" Marjorie cleared her throat. \"Is that so? I don\u0027t see why there would be any connection…?\" She let the remainder of the question dangle in thin air. \"There\u0027s a connection, all right,\" Nick assured her with the grave authority of an expert in his field. \"It\u0027s obvious that someone is promoting the gossip in order to divert attention from himself.\" He gave it half a beat before adding very deliberately, \"Or herself, as the case may be. It\u0027s an old tactic.\" \"It is?\" Marjorie asked warily. \"Sure. Thieves and bad guys use it all the time. That\u0027s why the first thing law enforcement types do is check out the rumors surrounding a crime. They call it following leads.\" \"I see.\" Marjorie cleared her throat again. \"I didn\u0027t know that.\" \"Probably because you\u0027ve never read one of my books,\" Nick said very politely. Octavia gritted her teeth. Things were getting nasty out there. She tried to sort more swiftly through the pictures. She was pretty sure Katy had done a drawing of a house. And she thought she recalled a big yellow flower, too. \"I\u0027m making a list of everyone who repeats the gossip,\" Nick explained. \"Checking out the sources. See who\u0027s trying to spread the rumors.\" \"That doesn\u0027t sound very helpful.\" Marjorie sounded a little desperate now. \"When I\u0027m done, I\u0027ll give the list to Sean Valentine so that he can take a closer look at some of the people on it. I figure it\u0027s safe to say that someone on the list will prove to be the guilty party.\" \"I don\u0027t think you can make that assumption.\" Alarm registered in Marjorie\u0027s voice. \"I mean, that\u0027s ridiculous. Everyone in town is spreading that gossip.\" \"Not quite everyone,\" Nick said. \"For instance, I\u0027ll bet Gail, here, hasn\u0027t repeated the rumors.\" \"Nope, not me,\" Gail assured them with ferocious glee. \"I wouldn\u0027t spread that kind of outrageous nonsense. I\u0027ve got my position in the community to consider. After all, my family is third-generation here in Eclipse Bay. Same as yours, Marjorie.\" \"Well, I heard the story from Betty Stiles down at Fulton\u0027s,\" Marjorie said. Defensive now. \"I have no idea where she got it.\" \"Thanks, I\u0027ll talk to Betty,\" Nick said smoothly. \"Why waste your time?\" Marjorie asked. \"It\u0027s Sean Valentine\u0027s job to find that painting.\" \"I\u0027m doing this as a favor,\" Nick said. \"Octavia is what you might call a close friend of the family.\" There was another short pause. \"I see,\" Marjorie said cautiously. Octavia spotted Katy\u0027s picture and snatched it out of the stack of framed drawings. She hurried toward the door. \"Here\u0027s your daughter\u0027s picture.\" She thrust it across the counter toward Marjorie. \"It\u0027s a lovely drawing. Nice feel for color. Tell her she can keep the frame. Compliments of the gallery.\" \"Thank you. I truly do regret this. But I have to consider Gordon\u0027s position.\" Marjorie took the picture somewhat uncertainly and turned back to Nick. \"Good luck with your little investigation.\" \"I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll find out who took the painting,\" he said with astounding confidence. \"My list is almost finished.\" \"Yes, well, I certainly hope you get the situation resolved soon.\" Marjorie summoned up a polished smile. \"By the way, since you\u0027re in town for the summer, I\u0027ll be sure to send an invitation to Katy\u0027s birthday party to Carson. Katy\u0027s turning six in August, you know.\" \"I appreciate the thought,\" Nick said, \"but it would probably be better not to bother with the invitation. I\u0027m sure you can understand my situation here. I can\u0027t allow Carson to attend a birthday party given for a child whose mother\u0027s name is on my list. Got to consider Carson\u0027s position in the community, you see.\" Marjorie\u0027s jaw dropped visibly. Shock and horror blended in her expression. Octavia had a sudden urge to cover her face with both hands. Beside her, Gail did not make any attempt to conceal a satisfied grin. Marjorie pulled herself together with commendable speed. \"How dare you imply that I… that I\u0027m on your list.\" \"Don\u0027t worry about it, Marjorie,\" Nick said. \"When this is all over, I\u0027m sure everyone will eventually forget who was on the list and who wasn\u0027t.\" \"Of all the—\" Marjorie was overcome with outrage. Unable to speak, she simply stood there, glaring helplessly. \"You know,\" Nick went on as if nothing awkward had been said, \"if you\u0027d like to assist in the investigation, I\u0027d be very grateful. In fact, everyone in my family would really appreciate the favor. Given your position in the community, you could be very helpful.\" Marjorie\u0027s mouth worked once or twice before she managed to speak. \"Well, of course, I\u0027d love to help you but I honestly don\u0027t see how I could be of any more assistance. I told you, it was Betty Stiles who is spreading the story.\" \"I\u0027ll be talking to Betty next,\" Nick assured her. \"But, since you\u0027ve offered to help, there is one thing you could do that would go a long way toward narrowing my list.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" Nick glanced at the picture Marjorie clutched in her beringed hands. \"Leave Katy\u0027s drawing here with the others. It will send a strong signal to the community that you don\u0027t think the rumors are true.\" Marjorie was trapped and they all knew it. She shot a fulminating look at Octavia, and then she put the picture down on the counter and turned back to Nick with an earnest smile. \"Well, if you really think it would help—\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Nick said. \"No question about it. Like I said, I really appreciate it.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-53.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
