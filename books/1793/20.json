Octavia and Carson, absorbed in their task, barely noticed.\n Mitchell Madison ambushed him when he walked into the post office.\n \"Heard you had a date with Octavia Brightwell last night,\" Mitchell commented, looming in Nick\u0027s path.\n \"Word gets around.\"\n \"You went out to the Thurgarton place together, picked up some old painting, and then you went to her cottage. That right?\"\n \"Yes, sir. You are well informed.\"\n \"Now, see here.\" Mitchell put his face very close to Nick\u0027s. \"I thought I made it damn clear to Sullivan that I wouldn\u0027t stand by while you fooled around with Octavia.\"\n \"Whatever arrangements you made with my grandfather are your business, naturally, but I should probably tell you that I don\u0027t generally consult with Sullivan before I ask a woman out. I don\u0027t think you can blame him for the fact that I had dinner with Octavia last night.\"\n Mitchell squinted in a malevolent fashion. \"Is that so?\"\n \"Also, just to set the record straight, I don\u0027t call what Octavia and I did last night fooling around.\"\n \"What the devil do you call it?\"\n \"A date. Mature adults not otherwise involved in a committed relationship get to do stuff like that.\"\n \"Sounds like fooling around to me.\" Mitchell\u0027s jaw tightened. \"She tell you Claudia Banner was her great-aunt and that Claudia\u0027s passed on?\"\n \"I think the whole town is aware of those facts by now.\"\n \"I don\u0027t give a damn about the town. I\u0027m only interested in what\u0027s going on between you and Octavia.\"\n Nick lounged against one of the old-fashioned counters, folded his arms, and studied Mitchell with morbid fascination. \"Mind if I ask why you\u0027re so concerned with the subject of my social life?\"\n \"Because you\u0027ve got a reputation for lovin\u0027 \u0027em and leavin\u0027 \u0027em and givin\u0027 your girlfriends The Talk so they know up front that you\u0027re not serious. I\u0027ll be damned if I\u0027ll stand by and let you treat Claudia Banner\u0027s niece that way. That girl\u0027s got no family around to look after her, so I\u0027m gonna do it. You treat her right or you\u0027ll answer to me. We clear on that?\"\n \"Very clear. Can I pick up my mail now?\"\n Mitchell\u0027s brows bristled, but he reluctantly got out of the way. \"You know something, Harte?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"If you had any sense, you\u0027d get married again. Settle down and give that boy of yours a mother.\"\n \"The day I want advice on my personal life from a Madison, I\u0027ll be sure to ask.\"\n In the end they went with the gold metal frame. Octavia privately thought that the black did a better job of accenting Winston\u0027s gray fur, but Carson was entranced with the flashier look.\n When they finished the project, she put the picture together with the others she had prepared for the show.\n \"Winston looks great,\" Carson said, satisfied. \"I can\u0027t wait for the show. I was afraid maybe you wouldn\u0027t want to hang my picture because Dad kept bothering you.\"\n \"Are you kidding?\" She ushered Carson out of the back room into the gallery and closed the door behind them. \"I\u0027d never let my personal feelings get in the way of hanging a beautiful picture like yours. Wouldn\u0027t be good business.\"\n \"Great-Granddad says all business is personal. People just don\u0027t like to admit it.\"\n \"Everyone knows that your great-grandfather is brilliant when it comes to business.\"\n \"Yeah.\" Carson looked proud. \"He says I\u0027m gonna be brilliant at business, too. He says that in a few years I\u0027ll be running my own company.\"\n \"Is that what you want to do?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n She hid a smile. There was not so much as a flicker of doubt in the words. \"Nice to know where you\u0027re going so early in life.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\" Carson\u0027s small brow puckered slightly. \"Thanks for going out with Dad last night.\"\n \"You\u0027re welcome.\"\n \"He\u0027s been acting a little weird lately.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that.\"\n \"It\u0027s not your fault.\" Carson\u0027s expression was intent and very serious now. \"It\u0027s just that everyone keeps telling him that he oughta get a new wife so I can have a new mom.\"\n \"Pressure.\"\n \"Yeah. That\u0027s what Uncle Rafe and Uncle Gabe say. I heard Granddad tell Grandma not to put so much pressure on Dad, but she and Aunt Lillian and Aunt Hannah all say he needs some pressure.\"\n \"Hmm.\"\n \"They think Dad doesn\u0027t want to get married again because he\u0027s still sad about my mom being in heaven and all.\"\n \"Well, that may be true,\" she said gently.\n \"Maybe.\" Carson was clearly dubious. \"I don\u0027t remember her, but Dad does. He says she was really pretty and she loved me a lot.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure she did love you very much, Carson.\"\n \"Yeah, and everyone says Dad loved her. But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the reason he doesn\u0027t want to get married again. He told me once that if you lose someone, it doesn\u0027t mean you won\u0027t fall in love with someone else someday.\"\n This was dangerous territory, she thought. Time to change the subject.\n \"Carson, maybe it would be better if we talked about something else.\"\n He ignored that, intent on making his point. \"I think Dad just hasn\u0027t found a lady he really, really likes, you know?\"\n \"Quite possible.\" She went behind the counter and pulled out a sheet of paper. \"Now, then, I\u0027m trying to decide how to hang the children\u0027s pictures. I\u0027ve made a little map of the gallery. Want to help me choose a good spot for Winston?\"\n \"Okay.\" He scrambled up onto the stool. \"What about you, Miss Brightwell?\"\n That gave her pause. \"Me?\"\n \"Have you ever found a man you really, really like and want to marry?\"\n \"Not yet.\" She picked up a pencil.\n \"Think you will someday?\"\n \"Maybe. I hope so. I\u0027d love to have a son like you someday.\"\n \"Yeah?\" Carson looked pleased. \"You could have a kid of your own if you get married.\"\n \"Yes.\" Way past time to change the subject. She pulled the gallery floor plan closer so that they could both view it. \"Now, then, the first thing we have to keep in mind is that the pictures all have to be hung at the right height so that people your age can see them properly.\"\n He studied the floor plan. \"Not too high.\"\n \"Right.\" She sketched some pictures on a display panel. \"I was thinking of grouping them according to the age of the artists, but I\u0027m wondering if it might be better to arrange them by subject, instead.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-20.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
