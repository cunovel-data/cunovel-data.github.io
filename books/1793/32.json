Mitchell Madison. Bryce was at the wheel. Damn. He did not need another scene with Octavia\u0027s self-appointed guardian, Nick thought. Time to leave. \"You consider it real good,\" Young Boone said. \"Time you found yourself a wife. You\u0027re a Harte. Hartes get married and stay married.\" \"Say, Boone, I\u0027ve got to be on my way. You\u0027ll let me know if you hear anything about that painting, won\u0027t you?\" \"Sure. But it\u0027s probably gone for good.\" That gave Nick pause. He turned back. \"Why do you say that?\" \"Can\u0027t see anyone around here hangin\u0027 a stolen painting in his house. Sooner or later, someone would be bound to notice the damn thing.\" \"Okay, I\u0027ll give you that. And I\u0027ll also admit that this Upsall picture isn\u0027t the sort of fine art that you\u0027d expect would appeal to the connoisseurs among us here in Eclipse Bay.\" \"Heard it looked like something a kindergartner might turn out,\" Young Boone said. \"Hey, I\u0027ve got a kindergartner who can do better-looking art. Yeah, the Upsall is sort of ugly. Sure hard to envision someone like, say, Sandy down at the gas station, going to the trouble to steal it just so he could hang it on the wall of the restroom. And it would look a little out of place in the Total Eclipse, too.\" Boone thought for a moment. \"Still leaves all those fancy types up at the institute and Chamberlain College. They might go for that kinda thing.\" \"Maybe. If that\u0027s the case, we\u0027ll have to let Valentine deal with it. I\u0027m just checking out the possibility that someone local might have taken it as a prank or on a dare. I can see some guy who\u0027d had a couple-three-too-many beers down at the Total Eclipse deciding to swipe the painting as a stunt.\" \"Huh. Hadn\u0027t thought of that.\" \"In which case,\" Nick said in the same casual tone he\u0027d been using all day long, \"if it just shows up again there will be no questions asked.\" Young Boone squinted knowingly and snapped his oily rag. \"Gotcha. I\u0027ll spread the word.\" \"Thanks.\" Mitchell was out of the SUV. He had his cane in one hand and he was making straight for the dock where Nick stood. \"I\u0027d better get going,\" Nick said. \"Places to go, people to see.\" Boone glanced past him toward Mitchell, who was advancing rapidly. \"Good luck. Gonna be hard to avoid Madison. He\u0027s got a bee in his bonnet about you and that Miss Brightwell gal.\" \"I know.\" Nick assessed his chances of escape. He had the advantage of being several decades younger than Mitchell, and he hadn\u0027t developed any arthritis yet. If he moved quickly, he might just make it to the car before Madison intercepted him. \"See you around, Boone.\" \"See ya.\" Nick went swiftly along the gently shifting dock. He made it through the gate and was halfway across the parking lot when he realized he wasn\u0027t going to be able to dodge his pursuer. He could outrun him, of course, but that would have been the coward\u0027s way. Hartes did not run from Madisons. \"Hold up right there, Harte.\" Mitchell thumped his cane on the hard-packed ground as he veered to the right to block Nick\u0027s path. His bushy brows bristled across the bridge of his aggressive nose. \"I want to talk to you.\" Nick halted. Not much choice, he figured. \"\u0027Afternoon, sir,\" he said politely. \"Storm give you any trouble last night?\" \"Storms don\u0027t give me trouble.\" Mitchell planted himself in front of Nick and glowered ferociously. \"Hartes give me trouble. Just what the hell kind of game do you think you\u0027re playing with Octavia Brightwell?\" \"I don\u0027t want to be rude, sir, but I\u0027m in a hurry here. Maybe we should talk about this later.\" \"We\u0027ll talk right now.\" Mitchell banged the cane again for emphasis. \"I heard you spent the night out at Octavia\u0027s place.\" \"That, sir, is a flat-out lie.\" Mitchell was startled into momentary speechlessness. \"You tellin\u0027 me it was someone else? You weren\u0027t the man who was out there last night?\" \"I had dinner with Octavia,\" Nick said evenly. \"I went home afterward. I did not spend the night.\" \"The way I hear it, you were there until nearly one o\u0027clock in the morning.\" \"You\u0027ve got spies on your payroll?\" \"Don\u0027t need any spies. Young Boone saw you drive past the marina late last night. He told everyone at the post office first thing this morning.\" \"You know, sir, I hate to break this to you, but nowadays it\u0027s not all that unusual for a couple of adults to spend an evening together that doesn\u0027t wind up until one in the morning.\" \"Not here in Eclipse Bay, they don\u0027t, not unless they\u0027re foolin\u0027 around. And you two aren\u0027t a couple of adults.\" \"We\u0027re not?\" \"Nope.\" \"Mind if I ask just how you classify us, if not as adults?\" \"You\u0027re a Harte and Octavia is Claudia\u0027s great-niece.\" \"So?\" \"Shoot and damn, son.\" Mitchell raised the cane and waved it in a slashing arc. \"I warned you. If you think I\u0027m gonna just stand by and let you take advantage of that gal, you\u0027reâ€”\" \"Mitch, wait.\" Octavia\u0027s clear voice echoed across the parking lot. \"I can explain everything.\" Nick turned his head and saw Octavia coming toward them at top speed. She left the sidewalk in front of her shop and raced across Bay Street, hair flying behind her. He was amazed that she could actually run in the sexy little slides. They did not look as if they\u0027d provide adequate support or stability for this kind of exercise. But, then, what did he know about ladies\u0027 shoes? A car horn blared. Brakes screeched. Octavia paid no attention. She reached the opposite side of the street and kept moving, heading straight for Mitchell and Nick. \"You don\u0027t understand, Mitch,\" she shouted. \"It\u0027s okay, really it is.\" Mitchell glared at her with concern when she skidded to a halt, breathless and flushed, in front of him. \"See here, you all right?\" he asked. \"Something wrong?\" \"No, no, that\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to tell you.\" Still breathing hard, she shot a quick, unreadable glance at Nick and then turned back to Mitchell. \"I just wanted to assure you that you don\u0027t have to protect me from Nick.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-32.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
