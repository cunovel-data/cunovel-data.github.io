But I\u0027m pretty sure you\u0027ll like the picture of Winston best. I added some extra fur.\" \"Let\u0027s spread them out and take a look.\" Octavia led the way to a long white bench at the far side of the room. She and Carson unrolled the drawings and arranged them side by side. Octavia studied each picture in turn with rapt attention, her expression absorbed and serious—for all the world, Nick thought, as if she were considering the pictures for a real, high-profile, career-making show such as she had given Lillian a while back in Portland. \"The house is very good,\" she said after a moment. \"That\u0027s me and Dad inside,\" Carson said. \"Dad\u0027s the big one.\" Octavia gave Nick a fleeting glance. He could have sworn she turned a rosy shade of pink before hastily returning her attention to the picture. She cleared her throat. \"Yes, I can see that.\" \"This is Dead Hand Cove,\" Carson said, pointing to the next picture. \"Aunt Lillian said I should include it, but I think landscapes are boring. Just rocks and water. Take a look at Winston.\" Obediently Octavia moved to examine the furry gray blob with the pointy ears. \"You\u0027ve certainly captured the essence of his personality very well,\" she said. Carson was pleased. \"I told Dad you\u0027d like this one best. I brought my crayon with me. I can add some more fur if you want.\" \"No, I think he has precisely the right amount of fur,\" Octavia said decisively. \"I\u0027ll hang this one in the show.\" Carson bounced a little with excitement. \"Will you frame it?\" \"Of course. I\u0027m going to frame all of the pictures in the show.\" She looked at him. \"You forgot to sign it.\" \"I\u0027ll do it now.\" Carson whipped out his crayon and went to work inscribing his first name in large block letters in the right-hand corner of the picture. \"I almost forgot,\" he added, not looking up from the task, \"I promised Dad that if you liked my picture, I\u0027d tell you that it was okay to go out with him.\" A stunned hush enveloped the gallery. Nick looked at Octavia. Her veiled expression never flickered, but he saw something that might have been speculation in her eyes. Or was that just his imagination? Oblivious to the electricity he had just generated, Carson concentrated intently on printing the last letters of his name. \"Sorry about that,\" Nick muttered. \"No problem,\" Octavia murmured. There was another short, extremely uncomfortable silence. \"So?\" Octavia said. He frowned. \"So, what?\" \"So, are you going to ask me out again?\" \"Uh—\" He hadn\u0027t been caught this far off guard since high school. He felt like an idiot. He could only hope that he was not turning red. Something had changed in the situation, but he was at a loss to know what had happened. Only one way to find out, he thought. \"Dinner tonight?\" She hesitated; honest regret showed on her face. He\u0027d seen that look before. \"You\u0027re busy, right?\" he said without inflection. A cold feeling coalesced in his gut. He couldn\u0027t believe she\u0027d set him up like that. \"Well, I did promise Virgil Nash that I\u0027d drive out to the Thurgarton house after I close the gallery this afternoon. He and Arizona Snow want my opinion on some paintings that they discovered stashed in one of Thurgarton\u0027s closets. The thing is, I don\u0027t know how long it will take me.\" He relaxed. Maybe she hadn\u0027t set him up, after all. \"Forever,\" he said. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"It\u0027ll take you forever to even find the old Thurgarton place unless Virgil gave you really, really good directions. Thurgarton liked his privacy. There\u0027s no sign on the road leading to the turnoff, and the drive is hidden in the trees.\" \"Oh.\" Her fine, red-brown brows wrinkled delicately in a small frown. \"Virgil gave me a little map.\" \"Forget it,\" he said easily. \"I\u0027ll pick you up after you close the gallery this afternoon and drive you out there. Later we can go to dinner.\" \"I suppose that might work,\" she said. She sounded so damn casual, he thought. As if the decision she had just made weren\u0027t staggering in its implications. As if it weren\u0027t going to alter destinies and change the fate of nations. Okay, he could deal with the world shifting in its orbit. What really worried him was the question of why it had done so. After six turn-downs in a row, the Fairy Queen of Eclipse Bay had agreed to go out with him. Lucky number seven. Be careful what you wish for. Chapter 4 The little girl with the glossy brown hair and the big, dark eyes was back. Octavia was discussing the merits of a charming seascape with a middle-aged tourist couple when she caught sight of the youngster on the sidewalk outside. This was the second time this week that the girl had appeared. On the first occasion she had been accompanied by her mother, a pretty but quietly determined-looking woman who wore the unmistakable cloak of single parenthood. The pair had wandered into the gallery and looked at pictures for a long time. The child had been as absorbed in the works of art as her mother—an unusual event. Most kids found the paintings boring in the extreme. The woman had greeted Octavia politely and made it plain that she was not there to buy, just to look around. She had clearly been braced for a cool reception, but Octavia had assured her that she was welcome to browse. The woman and her daughter had moved from picture to picture, talking seriously in low tones about some of them, showing little interest in others. They had been standing in front of a brilliant abstract when the woman had glanced at her watch, frowned in alarm, and hurried out of the gallery with the little girl. The woman had not returned, but her daughter was here again, standing on the other side of the glass staring at the colorful poster in the window that announced the Children\u0027s Art Show. I\u0027m not going to lose her this time, Octavia thought. \"Excuse me,\" she said to the couple contemplating the purchase of the seascape. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" She hurried behind the sales counter, reached down, and selected a large box of crayons from a carton that was nearly empty. She took a pad of drawing paper from the dwindling pile. Crayons and pad in hand, she straightened quickly and looked out the window. The little girl was still there. Octavia crossed the gallery, opened the front door, and stepped out onto the sidewalk. The child turned, looking a bit startled.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-9.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
