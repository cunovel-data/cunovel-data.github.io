Not yet, at any rate.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t know what to say. \"You know?\"\\n\\n \"Sullivan spotted the likeness the night you hosted that show for Lillian\u0027s paintings down at your little gallery. Soon as he pointed it out, I finally realized why there had always been something sort of familiar about you.\" He smiled faintly. \"You look a lot like Claudia did when she was your age. Same red hair. Something about your profile, too, I think. The way you hold yourself.\"\\n\\n \"But how did you—\"\\n\\n \"Sullivan made some phone calls. Did some checking. Wasn\u0027t hard to find the connection.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\" She was feeling a little stunned, she realized. Maybe a little deflated, too. So much for her big bombshell.\\n\\n \"Not like you tried to hide it,\" Mitchell said.\\n\\n \"No, but I certainly didn\u0027t want to make a big deal about it here in Eclipse Bay, given what happened in the past and all.\"\\n\\n Mitchell reached down and plucked a lush orange-gold bloom. \"Funny thing about the past. The older you get, the less it matters.\"\\n\\n She fell silent for a long moment, shifting gears as she adjusted to the turn of events. \"If Sullivan made some calls, you probably know about Aunt Claudia.\" She took a deep breath. \"That she\u0027s gone, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Mitchell looked up from the rose. His gaze was steady and a little sad. \"Heard she passed on a year and a half ago. Heart problems, Sullivan said.\"\\n\\n She felt the familiar tightening inside. Eighteen months but she still had to fight back the tears. \"She never managed to give up the cigarettes. In the end, the doctor said it was amazing she made it as long as she did.\"\\n\\n \"I remember Claudia and her cigarettes. She was always reaching for the next one. Had herself a fancy little gold lighter. I can still see her taking it out of her purse to light another smoke.\"\\n\\n \"Mitchell, let me get something straight here. Are you telling me that you and Sullivan don\u0027t care that I\u0027m related to Claudia Banner?\"\\n\\n \"Of course we care. But it\u0027s not exactly what you\u0027d call a problem for us.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" She was not sure how to respond to that.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t say we weren\u0027t a bit curious at first, though,\" he added dryly.\\n\\n \"I can imagine. Why didn\u0027t you say something? Ask questions? Demand an explanation? I\u0027ve stopped by here almost every morning or afternoon when I\u0027m in town to say hello. I must have talked to you dozens of times since Lillian\u0027s show. But you never said a word. I\u0027ve seen Sullivan on several occasions, too. He never gave any indication that he knew who I was.\"\\n\\n \"It was your personal business. Sullivan and I talked about it some. Figured we\u0027d let you tell us in your own time.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\" She thought about that for a while. \"Did you, uh, mention your little insight to anyone else?\"\\n\\n \"Nope. Didn\u0027t figure it was anyone else\u0027s affair.\"\\n\\n \"Believe me, I understand.\" She wrinkled her nose. \"If word got out that Claudia Banner\u0027s great-niece was in town and that she had become friends with the Madisons and the Hartes, there would be no end to the wild rumors and speculation. That\u0027s exactly why I kept a low profile.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\"\\n\\n \"It wouldn\u0027t have been fair to you Madisons or to the Hartes. You\u0027ve all suffered enough over the years because of what happened when you got involved with Aunt Claudia.\"\\n\\n Mitchell snorted. \"Madisons and Hartes are used to folks around here talking about us. Claudia may have been the spark that started the feud, but you can\u0027t blame her for the fact that Sullivan and I kept it going all those years. Hell, Madisons and Hartes have been inspiring conversation here in Eclipse Bay all by ourselves for decades. Got a real talent for it. Sometimes I think the good Lord put us on this earth just to keep this town entertained.\"\\n\\n In other words, her concern for discretion and the privacy of the Madison and Harte families had been a complete waste of time and energy on her part. She sighed inwardly. Not only was she not needed here, Mitchell and Sullivan hadn\u0027t even cared enough about her presence in town to ask for explanations.\\n\\n The day was getting more depressing by the minute.\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s that, then, isn\u0027t it?\" She straightened her shoulders, preparing to leave. \"I just wanted you to know, Mitch.\" She took a step back. \"Guess I\u0027ll be going.\" She retreated another step. \"Your roses look incredible, by the way.\"\\n\\n Mitchell rapped his cane on the gravel again. \"Hang on a minute. I\u0027m the first to admit that you\u0027ve got a right to keep your private business private, but now that you\u0027ve mentioned Claudia and what happened in the past, I think maybe I\u0027ve got a right to know why you\u0027ve suddenly decided to pull up stakes.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hard to explain.\"\\n\\n His hawklike eyes gleamed with shrewd comprehension. \"It\u0027s Nick Harte, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n She was dumbfounded. \"I, uh—\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s been pestering you, hasn\u0027t he? I knew it. I saw the way he moved in on you the night of Lillian\u0027s show. When he turned up in town a couple of weeks ago and settled into the Harte cottage for the summer, I got right on the phone to Sullivan.\"\\n\\n \"You what?\"\\n\\n \"I warned him that he\u0027d better keep Nick reined in good and tight. Told him I wouldn\u0027t stand by and let his grandson play any of his love \u0027em and leave \u0027em games with you. I don\u0027t care if Nick is still broken up about losing his wife. That\u0027s no excuse to fool around with you. Time he got over what happened and straightened himself out. Time he started acting like a real Harte again.\"\\n\\n \"A, uh, real Harte?\" she repeated carefully.\\n\\n \"Damn right. Hartes don\u0027t mess around and have affairs. Hartes get married.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard that theory,\" she said dryly. \"But there are exceptions to every rule. In any event, set your mind at rest, Mitch. This has got nothing to do with Nick Harte.\"\\n\\n Even as the words left her lips, she realized she was lying through her teeth. Leaving Eclipse Bay had everything to do with Nick Harte. She just wasn\u0027t sure how to explain the connection, not even to herself, let alone to Mitchell.\\n\\n \"Bullshit.\" Mitchell glowered. \"Pardon my language. But you\u0027ve got to admit that the timing is more than a tad suspicious.\"\\n\\n \"Look, Mitch, we\u0027re getting a little off-topic here. I stopped by to tell you about my link to Claudia Banner.\\n\\n But since you already know about it, maybe I should tell you why I came here to Eclipse Bay in the first place.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-5.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
