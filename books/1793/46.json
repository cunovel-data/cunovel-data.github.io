If she decides to work hard at her drawing and if she has a passion for it, I think she could someday be a fine artist.\"\n \"Yeah.\" He kicked at a clump of grass.\n \"Different people have different kinds of talents,\" she said. \"It\u0027s true that Anne has a gift for drawing. But the fact that you could see that her picture was so good means that you have another kind of talent.\"\n He glanced at her, still scowling but intrigued now. \"What kind?\"\n \"It isn\u0027t everyone who can take one look at a picture and know that it is very good.\"\n \"Big deal.\"\n \"Yes, it is a big deal,\" she said matter-of-factly. \"You have an eye for excellence, and that talent will be an enormous asset to you in the years ahead.\"\n \"How do you know?\" he grumbled.\n \"Because it\u0027s the same talent I\u0027ve got.\"\n That stopped him for a few seconds. Then he looked appalled. \"The same kind?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"But I don\u0027t wanna run an art store. I wanna run a big company like Granddad Hamilton and Great-Granddad Sullivan. Dad says that\u0027s probably what I\u0027ll do on account of it\u0027s in my genes or something.\"\n \"The talent to recognize quality and beauty when you see it will be useful to you no matter what you do with your life,\" she said.\n \"You\u0027re sure?\"\n \"Positive.\"\n \"Cause I don\u0027t wanna have to run a little art gallery like yours.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry, I doubt if you\u0027ll end up doing that for a living. But you may decide to buy art to hang in your home or on the walls of your office someday, and with your talent you\u0027ll be able to buy really excellent art. You won\u0027t have to pay a consultant to tell you what\u0027s good and what\u0027s not so good. You\u0027ll be able to make your own decisions.\"\n \"Huh.\" But he was clearly somewhat mollified by the prospect of making decisions.\n \"Who knows?\" she said. \"Maybe someday you\u0027ll be in a position to buy one of Anne\u0027s paintings.\"\n \"I\u0027m not gonna buy any pictures of her dumb dog, that\u0027s for sure.\"\n Dinner went well, Nick thought later. He was unaccountably relieved, even pleased. It had, after all, been a new experience for him. Not that he couldn\u0027t do salad and boil a pot full of some of Rafe\u0027s ravioli stuffed with gorgonzola cheese, spinach, and walnuts. He had, after all, been cooking for himself and Carson for quite a while now.\n But when he had resumed a social life a year or so after Amelia\u0027s death, he had consciously or unconsciously confined himself to women who, he was fairly certain, would not have been comfortable sitting at a kitchen table with a precocious kid.\n Maybe the women of the Harte family had been right all along, he thought. Maybe he just hadn\u0027t wanted to see any of his dates in a domestic light. You looked at a woman differently after you\u0027d seen her hanging out in your kitchen, carrying on an intelligent conversation about dogs and dinosaurs with your son.\n Whatever the case, one thing was certain. When he looked across the old kitchen table this evening, a wooden table that had been scarred and scuffed with the marks of three generations of Harte family meals, it had hit him with shattering clarity that Octavia looked perfect sitting here with Carson and himself.\n They played all of the ancient board games that had accumulated in the hall closet over the years until Carson reluctantly fell asleep on the sofa. Nick carried him upstairs to bed. When he returned to the living room, Octavia was in her coat, fishing her keys out of her pocket.\n \"It\u0027s getting late,\" she said, smiling a little too brightly. \"I\u0027d better be on my way. Thanks for dinner.\"\n She was the one running away this time, he thought.\n \"I\u0027ll walk you out to your car.\"\n He collected his jacket from the closet and put it on without buttoning it. When he opened the front door he smelled the sea and saw the trailing wisps of a light fog.\n \"Good thing I\u0027m going now,\" Octavia said. She stepped out onto the porch and looked around. \"This stuff looks like it\u0027s going to get heavier.\"\n \"Probably.\" He followed her outside, leaving the door ajar. \"Thanks for what you said to Carson earlier. He\u0027s feeling a lot better now that he knows you\u0027re not going to judge him solely on his art.\"\n \"No problem.\"\n \"The kid\u0027s a Harte, what can I say? He wants you to like him and he\u0027ll do whatever he thinks will work.\"\n \"He doesn\u0027t have to worry. I like him. A lot. He\u0027s a pretty terrific kid.\"\n He gripped the railing with both hands and looked out into the gathering mist. \"What about me?\"\n \"You?\"\n \"I\u0027d better warn you that this is a case of like son, like father.\"\n She went still on the top step and gave him a politely quizzical look. \"You want me to like you?\"\n \"I want you to like me a lot.\"\n She jangled her keys. \"If this is about sleeping with me againâ€”\"\n \"It is about sleeping with you again,\" he said deliberately. \"But it\u0027s also about explaining why I left in such a rush the other night.\"\n \"I know why you left in a rush. You panicked.\"\n He released the railing and swung around abruptly to catch hold of her by the shoulders. \"I did not panic.\"\n \"Sure you did. You\u0027re obviously dealing with a lot of unresolved issues connected to the loss of your wife, and when you get too close to a woman, you panic.\"\n \"Bullshit.\"\n She gave him a gentle, sympathetic pat on the arm. \"It\u0027s all right, I understand. I spent some time going through the grieving process after Aunt Claudia died. I can\u0027t even imagine how hard it would be to lose a beloved spouse.\"\n He tightened his hands on her now. \"It was hard, all right. But not for the reasons you think. I\u0027m going to tell you something that no one else, not even anyone in my family, knows.\"\n She stiffened. \"I\u0027m not sure I want to hear it.\"\n \"Too late, I\u0027m going to tell you, whether you want to hear it or not. You probably know that the man at the controls of that small plane that crashed with Amelia on board was a family friend.\"\n \"Yes. Everyone knows that.\"\n \"Yeah, well hardly anyone else except his wife and me knows just what a very good friend he was of Amelia\u0027s.\"\n \"Nick, please stop.\"\n \"I found out after the funeral that they had been lovers at one time. They\u0027d quarreled and each of them wound up marrying someone else. A couple of months before that plane crash, they had reconnected. It seems they\u0027d both reached the earthshaking conclusion that they had married the wrong people.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-46.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
