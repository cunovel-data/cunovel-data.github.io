{"id":79160,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The collapse of the company decades earlier had ignited a feud between Sullivan and Mitchell that had thrived until recently. The bad blood between the Hartes and the Madisons was legendary in these parts. It had provided fodder for the gossips of Eclipse Bay for three generations. But the first crack in the wall that had separated the two very different families had come last fall when Rafe Madison, the bad boy of the Madison family, had married Nick\u0027s sister Hannah. Several more bricks had crumbled last month when his other sister, Lillian, had wed Gabe Madison. But the earth-shattering news that Harte Investments and Gabe\u0027s company, Madison Commercial, were in the process of merging had been the final blazing straw as far as the good people of Eclipse Bay were concerned. The newly formed corporation, after all, effectively re-created the company that had been ripped apart at the start of the feud. Life had seemingly come full circle. \"You may be right about the Winston picture,\" Nick said. \"But the house is pretty good, too. The green flower is a great touch.\" \"Yeah, but there will be lots of houses and flowers in the art show. All the kids I know like to draw houses and flowers. Probably won\u0027t be any other dogs, though. Hardly anyone can draw a dog, especially not one as good as Winston.\" \"Winston is unique. I\u0027ll give you that.\" Carson looked up at him with a considering expression. \"I\u0027ve been thinking, Dad.\" \"What?\" \"Maybe you shouldn\u0027t come with me when I take my pictures to Miss Brightwell tomorrow.\" Nick raised his brows. \"You want me to wait in the car?\" Carson smiled, clearly relieved. \"Good idea. That way she won\u0027t even see you.\" \"You\u0027re really afraid I\u0027m going to mess up your shot at getting a picture into the gallery show, aren\u0027t you?\" \"I just don\u0027t want to take any chances.\" \"Sorry, pal. I\u0027ve got my own agenda here and I\u0027m not about to waste a perfectly good opportunity to move ahead with it just because you\u0027re worried she won\u0027t hang your picture.\" So he didn\u0027t have a lot of interest in the family business. He was still a Harte, Nick thought: He was just as goal-oriented and capable of focusing on an objective as anyone else in the clan. \"If you wait in the car,\" Carson said ingratiatingly, \"I promise I\u0027ll tell Miss Brightwell that it would be okay to go out with you.\" One of the Harte family mottos in action, Nick thought, not without a degree of sincere admiration. When you find yourself backed into a corner, negotiate your way out of it. \"Let me get this straight.\" He hooked his thumbs in the waistband of his jeans and looked down at his son. \"If I agree to stay out of the way tomorrow, you\u0027ll put in a good word for me?\" \"She likes me, Dad. I think she\u0027d agree to go out with you if I asked her.\" \"Thanks, but no thanks. I may not have followed in the family footsteps like Dad and Granddad, but that doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t know how to get what I want.\" And he definitely wanted Octavia Brightwell. That, he thought, was the real reason he and Carson were in Eclipse Bay for an extended stay. He had come here to lay siege to the castle of the Fairy Queen. \"Well, okay, but promise you won\u0027t wreck things for me.\" \"I\u0027ll do my best.\" Resigned, Carson turned back to the dog picture. \"I think Winston needs more fur.\" He selected a crayon and went to work. She was an out-and-out coward. Octavia sat on the stool behind the gallery sales counter, the heels of her sandals hooked on the top rung, and propped her chin on her hands. She regarded the phone as if it were a serpent. One date. How could it hurt to go out with Nick Harte just once? But she knew the answer to that. If she accepted one invitation, she would probably accept another. And then there would be a third. Maybe a fourth. Sooner or later she would end up in bed with him and that would be the biggest mistake of her life. Some thrill rides were just too risky. They called him Hardhearted Harte back in Portland. Nick had a reputation for confining his relationships to discreet, short-term affairs that ended whenever his partner of the moment started pushing for a commitment. According to the gossip she had heard, Nick never went to bed with a woman without first having delivered what was known as The Talk. The Talk was said to be a clear, concise position statement that made it plain that he was not interested in any long-term arrangements like marriage. Women who chose to sleep with Nick Harte went into the relationship with their eyes wide open. They said that even if you lured him into your bed, he would be gone long before dawn. He never stayed the night, according to the stories that circulated about him. Here in Eclipse Bay, where gossip about the Hartes and the Madisons had been raised to a fine art, folks were certain that they knew the real reason for The Talk. The local mythology held that Nick, being a true Harte, was unable to love again because he was still mourning the loss of his beloved Amelia. He was under a curse, some said, doomed never to find another true love until the right woman shattered the spell that bound him. His reputation for never staying the night with any of his lovers only fanned the flames of that particular legend. Of course, that did not stop shoppers in the narrow aisles at Fulton\u0027s Supermarket from holding forth on the subject of the importance of Nick marrying again in order to provide his son with a mother. They said the same thing at the post office and in the hardware store. But Carson didn\u0027t need a mother, Octavia thought. Nick was doing a fine job of raising him, as far as she could tell. The boy was the most self-assured, well-adjusted, precocious little kid she had ever met in her life. And there was no shortage of feminine influence available to him. Carson enjoyed the warmth of a close-knit, extended family that included a doting grandmother, a great-grandmother, and two aunts, Lillian and Hannah. She unhooked her sandals, rose from the stool, and went to stand at the front window of Bright Visions. The morning fog was thinning, but it had not yet burned off. Across the street she could just make out the pier and the nearby marina. The lights were on in the Incandescent Body bakery down the street, and she could see the erratic snap and pulse of the broken neon sign that marked the Total Eclipse Bar \u0026 Grill. The tavern\u0027s logo, Where the Sun Don\u0027t Shine, was just barely visible. The rest of the world was lost in a sea of gray mist. Just like her life. A shiver went through her. Where had that thought come from? She wrapped her arms around herself. She would not go there, she vowed silently.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-3.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
