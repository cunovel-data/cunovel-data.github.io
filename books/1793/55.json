{"id":79212,"no":55,"title":"Page 55","content":"\"I only read books about serial killers.\"\n \"Figures,\" Nick said.\n \"Who would have thought you\u0027d have made a successful career as a writer? You know, the day I heard you\u0027d quit Harte Investments I told Edith Seaton that you were making a big mistake. \u0027Edith,\u0027 I said,\u0027that young man is going to ruin his life and break his grandfather\u0027s heart\u0027.\"\n \"We all survived, interestingly enough. Mrs. Stiles, I wondered if I could ask you a few questions.\"\n \"You\u0027re trying to find that missing painting, aren\u0027t you?\" Betty sighed. \"Of course you can ask me some questions, but if what I\u0027ve heard is true, I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re wasting your time.\"\n \"Why is that?\"\n She lowered her voice. \"Well, dear, as everyone knows, the most likely suspect is Octavia Brightwell.\"\n \"Funny you should mention that, Mrs. Stiles. I\u0027ve heard the same thing and I\u0027m trying to find out who started that rumor. Thought maybe you could tell me.\"\n \"You want to know who started it?\" Betty asked incredulously.\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"But why does it matter, dear? I mean, it\u0027s perfectly obvious when you think about it that Miss Brightwell is the person most likely to be the thief.\"\n \"It\u0027s not obvious to me,\" Nick said.\n \"Oh.\" Betty seemed baffled by that news. Then she gave him a pitying look and patted his arm. \"Well, I suppose it\u0027s understandable that you would want to think the best of her under the circumstances. But for what it\u0027s worth, my advice is to find another girlfriend.\"\n Nick smiled coldly. The hard part about being a real private eye, he decided, was that sometimes it was extremely difficult to avoid losing your temper. But there was nothing to be gained by telling Betty Stiles that she was an interfering busybody.\n \"I don\u0027t plan to take your advice, Mrs. Stiles. So that leaves me with no choice except to find the real thief.\"\n \"But if Miss Brightwell took the pictureâ€”\"\n \"Octavia didn\u0027t take it.\"\n She made a tut-tut sound. \"You seem very sure of that.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure, Mrs. Stiles.\"\n \"Really, Nicholas, I wouldn\u0027t have thought that you were the type to be so easily taken in by a woman\u0027s wiles.\"\n \"And here I thought you were too smart to be conned by a thief.\"\n Betty bridled. \"I beg your pardon?\"\n \"Isn\u0027t it obvious? Whoever started the rumor is the person who stole the painting.\"\n \"But that\u0027s ridiculous.\"\n \"Where did you hear it first, Mrs. Stiles?\"\n Betty drew herself up with great dignity. \"I heard it right here at the beauty shop.\"\n Nick looked past her through the window and saw two women sitting under the hair dryers. They had magazines on their laps but neither was reading. Both were focused intently on the scene taking place outside the shop. The owner of the salon, Carla Millbank, was watching him in the mirror as she wrapped a client\u0027s hair in little pieces of aluminum foil.\n His conversation with Betty was going to be all over town by nightfall.\n His new problem loomed large. The gender divides in Eclipse Bay were still firmly entrenched. There were some places a man could not go. Carla\u0027s Custom Cut \u0026 Curl was terra incognita for every male in the community.\n Fifteen minutes later he walked into Bright Visions, still fine-tuning the details of his new scheme.\n The place appeared to be empty except for Octavia, who was sitting on the high stool behind the counter. She looked up from some notes she was jotting down on a sheet of paper.\n \"There you are,\" she said. \"I was getting worried. Did you find Betty Stiles?\"\n \"For all the good it did me.\" He studied the two framed paintings leaning against the wall. \"I don\u0027t remember those. Are they new?\"\n An odd expression crossed her face. \"Yes, as a matter of fact.\"\n \"I\u0027m no expert, but I like them.\"\n \"So do I.\"\n \"Nice view of the Arch. The scene of the pier at night is great, too. Sort of moody with the fog and the dark water and that little light on the boat. Who\u0027s the artist?\"\n There was a movement in the doorway behind the counter. Jeremy appeared from the back room. He looked at Nick with a veiled expression.\n \"That would be me,\" Jeremy said.\n Gail came to stand beside him. \"Isn\u0027t he terrific?\" She was bubbling with enthusiasm. \"I\u0027ve already got a client in mind.\"\n Of course it would be Jeremy, Nick thought. What the hell was the matter with him? How could he have forgotten Jeremy and his considerable commercial talent. If he\u0027d been paying attention instead of concentrating on how to get someone inside the beauty shop, he would have put it all together instantly as soon as he saw the pictures. Now he was stuck with doing the polite, civilized thing in front of Octavia and Gail.\n \"Congratulations,\" he said to Jeremy, keeping his voice absolutely level. \"Nice work.\"\n \"Be even nicer work if it pays,\" Jeremy said. His tone was just as level as Nick\u0027s. \"But I\u0027m not going to quit my day job anytime soon. I mean, what are the odds of actually being able to make a living by painting? A million to one, maybe?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure Nick knows exactly how you feel,\" Octavia commented. \"He must have had the same doubts when he put his first manuscript in the mail. Isn\u0027t that right, Nick?\"\n She had him neatly cornered, he thought.\n \"Sure,\" he said. \"And every time I\u0027ve put a manuscript in the mail since that first one. It always feels a lot like jumping off a cliff.\"\n Obviously it had been a mistake to tell her what lay beneath the surface of this little feud he and Jeremy had going. What was it with her, anyway? Why couldn\u0027t she let the two of them conduct their private war without outside interference?\n Jeremy looked serious. \"The jumping-off-the-cliff thing never goes away?\"\n Nick shrugged. \"Not that I\u0027ve noticed. My advice is to get used to it. It\u0027ll give you an edge.\" He switched his gaze to Gail. \"How would you like to play undercover agent?\"\n \"Do I get to wear a trench coat?\" Gail asked.\n \"Not unless you want to get the collar wet in the shampoo bowl.\"\n Octavia hopped off her stool. \"Carla\u0027s Custom Cut \u0026 Curl? You want Gail to see what she can pick up in the way of gossip in the beauty shop?\"\n \"Yeah. Betty Stiles says that\u0027s where she first heard the rumors.\"\n \"You\u0027re really serious about this detective thing, aren\u0027t you?\" Jeremy asked Nick.\n \"No, I just needed something interesting to put down in my journal under the subject of what I did on my summer vacation,\" Nick retorted. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-55.html","bookId":1793,"book":{"id":1793,"title":"Summer in Eclipse Bay (Eclipse Bay #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Word gets around fast in Eclipse Bay.
