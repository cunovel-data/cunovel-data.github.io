{"id":99505,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\"It was just a movie monster,\" Dervish says.\n \"No. It was real. It killed Emmet.\"\n We\u0027re still in the alley. The blood\u0027s being washed away and people are chattering about the big scene with the demon. I grabbed Dervish as soon as I could move. Told him what I thought. He thinks differently.\n \"Grubbs, come on, I said it was going to be realistic. You\u0027re-\"\n \"I know what I saw!\" I retort, voice rising. \"That was a demon, like Lord Loss! It killed Emmet!\"\n Juni looks at me oddly. Bill-E is gawping openly. Dervish smiles crookedly at them, takes hold of my elbow and marches me out of earshot. \"Are you insane?\" he hisses as we turn a corner. \"We\u0027re on a film set. That was a guy in a costume. A very convincing costume, but just-\"\n \"Don\u0027t tell me you thought that wasn\u0027t real,\" I moan. \"Didn\u0027t you feel it in your gut, the same thing you felt when we faced Lord Loss? The magic in the air?\"\n Dervish glares at me. Starts to say something. Stops, his expression softening. \"I\u0027ve been a fool. I thought you\u0027d got over the Lord Loss incident, but I guess you haven\u0027t.\"\n \"Of course I haven\u0027t \u0027got over\u0027 it!\" I snort. \"You don\u0027t \u0027get over\u0027 demons murdering your parents and sister! But I\u0027ve dealt with it. Moved on. This isn\u0027t delayed shock. I know what I saw and that was a real bloody demon.\"\n \"You\u0027re hysterical,\" Dervish says.\n \"No,\" I snarl. \"Look at me. Look into my eyes. I\u0027m not being a big kid. That. Was. A. Demon. Nobody can mimic the look and movements-the aura-of a real demon. I don\u0027t care how many special-effects artists work on it. Some things can\u0027t be replicated, by anybody, ever.\"\n \"Grubbs...\" Dervish can\u0027t think of anything else to add.\n \"Where\u0027s Emmet?\" I challenge him. \"If he was acting, why didn\u0027t he come out when Davida yelled \u0027cut\u0027?\"\n \"They took him away to wash the blood off,\" Dervish says.\n I shake my head. \"I bet you\u0027re wrong. I bet we can\u0027t find him.\"\n Dervish sighs impatiently. \"OK. Let\u0027s go look for Emmet. But!\" He raises a finger. \"When we find him and you see that he\u0027s unharmed, I want you to accept it. I don\u0027t want you saying it\u0027s not really Emmet, it\u0027s a changeling, or any nonsense like that. OK?\"\n \"Fine,\" I smile bitterly.\n Grumbling sourly, Dervish leads me away in search of Emmet Eijit, even though I know in my heart that the only place we\u0027ll find him now is amidst the bones and scattered shreds of skin in some dirty demon\u0027s den.\n Emmet\u0027s not in any of the trailers. Nobody\u0027s seen him. I shoot Dervish a meaningful look, but he waves it away and goes looking for Davida. She\u0027s still in the alley, talking with a technician. We wait for her to finish, then Dervish nudges forward and asks if she knows where Emmet is. Says we want to congratulate him on his performance.\n \"Of course!\" Davida cries. \"Hell, I want to too. I plain forgot about him. That was amazing. I loved the final touch-the scream for help. It worked perfectly. No need for a second take. He\u0027ll be getting the blood cleaned off, so-\"\n \"No,\" I interrupt. \"We checked. He isn\u0027t in make-up.\"\n \"Oh. Then I guess... Hey, Chuda! Where\u0027d Emmet get to?\"\n A tall, thin man without eyebrows steps forward. Chuda Sool, the first assistant director and Davida\u0027s closest confidant. They\u0027ve worked together on her last four films. He\u0027s a quiet sort, keeps to the background, makes sure everything\u0027s running smoothly, tries to head off problems before they bother Davida.\n \"There\u0027s been a flare-up,\" Chuda says softly. \"Perhaps we should speak about it in private.\"\n \"What are you talking about?\" Davida growls. \"What happened?\"\n \"Nora-Emmet\u0027s mother-ran into Tump Kooniart after shooting,\" Chuda says. \"They had a huge argument. Tump said some very nasty things. He upset her. Nora grabbed Emmet, demanded a car, collected their belongings and...\" Chuda shrugs.\n \"They left?\" Davida barks. \"Are you mad? Nobody leaves until shooting finishes. It\u0027s in their contract. Get them back!\"\n \"I can\u0027t,\" Chuda says. \"When Nora calms down, maybe we can convince her to return, but-\"\n \"She has no choice!\" Davida insists. \"She signed the contract. They have to stay on set for the duration.\"\n \"You\u0027re absolutely correct,\" Chuda says patiently. \"But she went anyway. You can withhold Emmet\u0027s payment and maybe force them back that way, but for the time being...\" He shrugs.\n \"Told you,\" I mutter, glancing up at Dervish. Then I turn and walk off, not wanting to waste my time on more ridiculous excuses. Emmet\u0027s dead, slaughtered by a demon. And if his mum\u0027s missing, that means she was probably killed too. Time for Grubbs Grady to make an ultra-quick exit from Slawter!\n \"You can\u0027t just walk off,\" Dervish argues as I pack my bag.\n \"Watch me.\" I turn to Bill-E, who\u0027s standing by his bed, blinking like a startled owl. \"You\u0027re coming too. I\u0027m not leaving you to end up like Emmet.\"\n \"It looks bad, especially as there\u0027s no sign of Emmet,\" Dervish says. \"But we need to make sure. Chuda could have been telling the truth. Emmet\u0027s mother-\"\n \"Bull!\" I snort. \"There was no argument with Tump Kooniart. Chuda made that story up. Emmet was killed by a demon. His mum\u0027s dead too, I guess. Chuda must be working for the demon, since he lied to cover up the truth. And I doubt if he\u0027s the only one.\"\n \"Wait a minute,\" Bill-E splutters. \"You believe that was a real demon? You think Emmet was really killed? Are you mad?\"\n \"Maybe,\" I laugh shortly. \"But if I am, I\u0027m going to be mad far, far away from Slawter. And you\u0027re coming with me. I won\u0027t leave you behind.\" I look hard at Dervish. \"I won\u0027t.\"\n \"OK,\" Dervish sighs. \"I won\u0027t keep you here against your will. But you\u0027re overreacting. Until we know for sure, we should-\"\n There\u0027s a knock at the door. Juni Swan. \"Can I come in?\"\n I go stiff. Is Juni working with Chuda Sool and the demon? Has she been sent to convince me that my imagination has run wild? I like Juni. I\u0027d hate to think that she\u0027s evil. But if she backs up Chuda\u0027s story...\n \"I wanted to check that everything\u0027s all right,\" Juni says, eyeing the bag which I\u0027m in the middle of packing.\n \"Did Chuda send you?\" I ask tightly.\n \"No. I came because I heard you telling Dervish that Emmet had been killed by a real demon. I wanted to know what you meant.\"\n \"I\u0027d have thought that was obvious.\"\n \"You can\u0027t truly believe that was a real demon,\" Juni says. \"Demons don\u0027t exist, do they, Dervish?\"\n Dervish clears his throat. \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t say that exactly.\"\n \"But... we\u0027re making a film about demons. That was just an act. Emmet-\"\n \"-has mysteriously disappeared,\" I cut in.\n Juni frowns. \"Excuse me?\"\n \"Nora had a fight with Tump Kooniart,\" Dervish explains. \"The way we heard it, she lost her temper, grabbed Emmet, demanded a car and took off.\"\n \"But she can\u0027t have,\" Juni says. \"Their contract...\"\n \"They tore it up,\" Dervish says softly. \"Allegedly.\"\n Juni\u0027s frown deepens. Then she looks at me, expression clearing. \"That explains the bag. You think this confirms what you suspected. You\u0027re getting out before the demons kill you too.\"\n \"Damn straight.\"\n Juni nods slowly. \"And if I try to convince you that Emmet hasn\u0027t been killed... that demons aren\u0027t real... would you think I was part of a conspiracy?\"\n I hesitate, not wanting to offend her if she\u0027s innocent.\n \"I don\u0027t know anything about a fight between Nora and Tump, or why Nora would have been allowed to leave,\" Juni says steadily. \"And it\u0027s strange that it happened so quickly, without them saying goodbye to anyone. You might be right. The demon could have been real. Maybe it did kill Emmet.\"\n Juni reaches inside the light jacket that she\u0027s wearing and pulls a pink mobile phone out of a pocket. She holds it towards me. As I take it, suspicious, she says, \"I have contact numbers for everyone connected to the children working on this film. Nora\u0027s number is in there. I\u0027d like you to call her.\"\n I glance up sharply. \"No tricks,\" Juni says. \"I don\u0027t know what will happen when you dial that number. I\u0027m making no promises. I think Nora will answer, or if she doesn\u0027t, you can leave a message and she\u0027ll phone back shortly. But short of us getting a car and tearing after them in hot pursuit, I think this is the only way to determine the truth.\"\n I stare at the buttons. I don\u0027t want to do this. I want to pass the phone back to Juni, finish packing and get the hell out.\n But I can\u0027t. Because maybe-just maybe-I called this wrong. Maybe the fear dates back to my fight with Lord Loss and my mind\u0027s playing tricks on me. I\u0027m pretty sure it isn\u0027t. But if I refuse to dial, I\u0027ll look like a crackpot.\n I unlock the phone. Thumb up the list of names. \"Is it under E or N?\" I ask.\n \"N for Nora,\" Juni says.\n I search for the Ns. There\u0027s a lot of them. I scroll down. There it is-Nora Eijit. I hit the dial button. It rings. Once. Twice. Three times. Four. Fi-\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it!\" a woman\u0027s voice snaps. \"Kooniart can fry in the fires of hell! You tell him-\"\n \"Mrs. Eijit?\" I interrupt.\n A pause. \"Who\u0027s this?\"\n \"Grubbs Grady. Emmet\u0027s friend.\"\n \"Oh. I\u0027m sorry. I saw Juni\u0027s name come up, so I assumed...\"\n \"I\u0027m ringing from her phone.\"\n \"I see. Do you want to speak to Emmet?\"\n \"Yes please.\" Speaking mechanically, figuring this could be any woman-I don\u0027t know Mrs. Eijit\u0027s voice well enough to make a definite identification. Waiting for the kicker, for her to say he\u0027s asleep, or he doesn\u0027t want to talk to me, or-\n \"I\u0027ll pass you over.\"\n The sound of her phone being handed across. The noise of a car engine in the background. Then-Emmet. \"Hi, Grubbs,\" he says quietly, miserably.\n \"Hi,\" I reply weakly.\n \"I can\u0027t talk now. I\u0027m sorry I split without saying goodbye. I\u0027m hoping we can come back later, when-\"\n \"No way!\" Emmet\u0027s mum shrieks. \"Not unless that fat fool Kooniart gets down on his knees and-\"\n \"I\u0027ll have to call you back,\" Emmet says quickly and disconnects.\n I look at the little red button on Juni\u0027s phone. Slowly, reluctantly, I press it. Hand the phone back to Juni. Raise my eyes. And smile like a fool, silently admitting to Juni and the others that I was wrong-even though, inside, part of me still insists the demon was real.\n \"I can\u0027t believe you thought Emmet had been killed,\" Bill-E chuckles. It\u0027s the morning after. We\u0027re on our way to class.\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it,\" I mutter.\n \"I just don\u0027t see how you could-\"\n \"Enough!\" I snap. Then, softly, \"Remember what I told you about my parents? How they died?\"\n \"Oh. Yeah.\" Bill-E\u0027s face drops. \"Grubbs, I didn\u0027t mean-\"\n \"It\u0027s OK. Just don\u0027t say anything about it. Please? To the others?\"\n \"Of course not,\" Bill-E smiles. \"This stays between us. I\u0027ll never breathe a word of it to anyone, especially not Bo Kooniart and her mob. They\u0027d have to torture it out of me.\"\n \"Thanks. Because if they knew...\"\n \"Like I said, your secret\u0027s safe with me,\" Bill-E promises. \"Dervish won\u0027t say anything either, or Juni. Nobody will ever find out. It\u0027ll be coolio.\"\n \"Look out!\" Bo screams as we walk into class. \"It\u0027s a demon!\"\n Bo, Abe, Vanalee, Salit-even Kuk and Kik-howl theatrically, then burst out laughing. Miss Jaun blinks at them, astonished. I groan and raise my eyebrows at Bill-E, who can only shrug, bewildered.\n \"My dad was in the corridor outside your room,\" Bo says smugly. \"He heard you talking. He heard everything.\" She laughs again and I know I\u0027m in for a long few months. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slawter-the-demonata-3/page-6.html","bookId":2177,"book":{"id":2177,"title":"Slawter (The Demonata #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Slawter (The Demonata #3) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
