{"id":99506,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"The joke doesn\u0027t wear thin for Bo. Every day she drags it out, mocking and ridiculing me, keeping the story of my hysterics alive. She tells anyone who\u0027ll listen, the other actors, the crew, Davida. Most smile and dismiss it, too busy to bother about such trivial matters. But knowing they know causes me to blush fiercely every time somebody even glances at me.\n Emmet never rang back and I\u0027m too shamefaced to call him. I doubt if he\u0027ll have heard about my panic attack, but there\u0027s no telling how far Bo might have decided to spread the joke.\n The person I\u0027m angriest with-apart from myself, for being such an idiot-is Tump Kooniart. I can\u0027t blame Bo for wringing such wicked pleasure out of my embarrassment-it would be hard for any kid to ignore such a juicy bit of bait if it fell into their lap. But why was her father sneaking around outside our room? And why didn\u0027t he keep his big mouth shut? If Dervish had heard something like this about Bo, he wouldn\u0027t have told me.\n Tump Kooniart should have kept quiet. He didn\u0027t. So now it\u0027s payback time!\n I spend a lot of hours thinking about ways to get even with Bo\u0027s father. Itching powder in his clothes? Rat droppings in his soup? Human droppings in his stew or chocolate ice cream?!? Shave him bald or glue his lips together while he sleeps?\n All good stuff, but basic. I want something that\u0027ll give him a fright, that I can use to humiliate him. Like, if he\u0027s scared of rats, borrow one of the trained rats which are being used in the film, drop it down the back of his shirt when there\u0027s a crowd around, laugh my head off as he writhes and screams. But to do that, I\u0027ll have to find out more about him and what he\u0027s scared of.\n So I start shadowing him. I do it when I\u0027m not in class. I don\u0027t tell Bill-E. He\u0027d happily join in if he knew what I was up to, but I don\u0027t want him getting into trouble if this backfires. Tump Kooniart\u0027s a powerful player. If I humble him in public, I might end up being booted off the set. I don\u0027t mind that, but there\u0027s no need for Bill-E to suffer too.\n Tump\u0027s easy to follow. Tall and wide, always dressed in a drab brown suit. He walks with a slow waddle, mopping sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief which rarely leaves his hand. He usually talks loudly as he strolls, to himself if no one\u0027s with him. He doesn\u0027t seem to be able to keep silent, except when a scene is being filmed. I bet he even talks in his sleep. If I was blind, I could probably follow him by sound alone.\n I don\u0027t learn much about Tump, except he loves to talk and eat. He has a trailer on the western edge of Slawter, separate trailers beside it for Bo and Abe. Three of the biggest trailers on the set. When he\u0027s not on the prowl, making sure his actors are happy or pigging out in one of the canteens, he spends most of his time in the trailer. He makes lots of phone calls. There are no personal computers allowed in Slawter-no video mobiles either-so he has to work from a huge Filofax in which he keeps all his contact details and other info. I think about stealing the Filofax and burning it, but that\u0027s hardly going to leave him a trembling wreck!\n Close to Tump\u0027s trailer, nearly a week after I began shadowing him. Waiting for him to emerge, sitting in the shade of another trailer, reading a movie magazine-always plenty of those around. Starting to tire of the detective work. Bo\u0027s still annoying me, but her insults have grown stale. Nobody really laughs at her jokes any more. Maybe I should quit this game and forget about vengeance.\n Someone knocks on Tump\u0027s door. I look up and spot Chuda Sool entering the trailer. I haven\u0027t spoken to Chuda since the day of the \"demon\" attack. I\u0027m sure Bo told him about my hysterics. He must think I\u0027m a right nutter. He might even feel insulted that I didn\u0027t believe him when he told me about Nora and Tump.\n \"Look what the cat dragged in,\" someone says behind me. I jump, but it\u0027s only Bo, on her way back from filming. \"Discover any demons today, Grady?\"\n \"No. Discover any new jokes?\"\n \"Don\u0027t need them. Not when the old ones are still funny.\" She flashes her teeth and growls demonically. I yawn and focus on my magazine until she loses interest and goes away. I wait for the sound of her trailer door locking, then get up, angry, sick of hanging around. I could be playing foosball with Bill-E, not sitting here like a third-rate substitute, wasting my-\n Tump steps out of his trailer, followed by Chuda Sool. Tump\u0027s talking loudly, mopping away busily at his forehead. Chuda never seems to sweat, which is handy-without eyebrows, sweat would flow straight into his eyes. The pair set off in a northerly direction, looking a bit like Laurel and Hardy from the rear. Since I\u0027m here, I decide to follow. But this is the last time. I\u0027ve had enough.\n Tump and Chuda head for the D workshops. The huge warehouse dominates the northern part of Slawter. I haven\u0027t spent much time up here-no point, since access to the workshops is strictly prohibited. As Tump and Chuda show their passes to a security guard on the western door-one of four doors leading into the warehouse-I hang back and take a long look at the building.\n Three storeys high, 70 or 80 metres wide, maybe 120 metres long. Large, unplastered block walls. A flat roof. No windows. Grey and featureless, apart from a big red D painted on the wall above the door. A small guard\u0027s hut to the right of the entrance.\n I\u0027d love to have a look inside, at the monster costumes and puppets. A small part of me still believes the demon was real. If I could check out the costumes perhaps it would help convince me of the truth. But hardly anyone is allowed to enter the hallowed halls of the D workshops. Even Dervish has only seen a small section of the complex.\n I wait impatiently for Tump and Chuda to come out. Then I figure, stuff them! I\u0027m through with this crap. I decide to find Bill-E and hang out with him for the rest of the afternoon. But before departing, I wander around the warehouse on the off chance that one of the doors is open, its guard asleep in his hut. That won\u0027t happen, of course, but I might as well give it a shot while I\u0027m here.\n The guard on the southern door studies me suspiciously as I approach. Though he doesn\u0027t openly carry any weapons, it wouldn\u0027t surprise me if he had a gun hidden on him somewhere. I smile politely and don\u0027t stray any closer. Walk to the eastern end and turn left. The door on this side is shut too and although the guard\u0027s in his hut, he isn\u0027t asleep-I spot him through the window as I walk past, leafing through a magazine with pictures of tanks on the cover.\n I reach the northern end and turn left again. The guard here is standing next to the door, leaning against the wall. He smiles as I go past. I think about stopping to chat, maybe try to blag my way inside, but his smile isn\u0027t that inviting.\n Back to the western end. Heading south, thinking about where Bill-E might be. As I come up to the guard\u0027s hut, the door to the workshops opens. I hear Tump\u0027s voice and stop behind the hut, where he and Chuda can\u0027t see me, to wait until they pass.\n \"...not going to like it,\" Tump is booming.\n \"They\u0027re not meant to like it,\" Chuda replies in a much softer voice.\n \"But the boy will be hard to keep quiet. They\u0027re so close to each other. Maybe we should take them both.\"\n \"One will be enough,\" Chuda says. \"Now all we have to...\"\n Their voices fade. I remain where I am, frowning, wondering who and what they were talking about.\n The next day, Kik goes missing.\n Kuk turns up for class by himself, looking lost. \"Have any of you seen Kik?\" he asks, eyes darting around the room as if his twin sister might be hiding behind a desk. \"I can\u0027t find her. I don\u0027t know where she is. Kik? Are you here?\"\n Miss Jaun sits the agitated Kuk down, tries to soothe his nerves and coaxes the story out of him. It\u0027s not complicated. He woke this morning and Kik\u0027s bed was empty. He couldn\u0027t find her. Their dad wasn\u0027t too concerned-said she\u0027d probably gone for a walk-but Kuk smelt a rat immediately.\n \"We don\u0027t go anywhere without telling each other. She wouldn\u0027t have slipped out without saying anything.\"\n \"Maybe she just needed to be alone for a while,\" Miss Jaun suggests.\n \"We don\u0027t like being alone,\" Kuk says, shaking his head vigorously. \"Alone is bad. Alone is scary.\"\n When Miss Jaun fails to calm Kuk\u0027s nerves, she calls security and asks a guard if he can put the word out to look for Kik. \"It\u0027s no big deal,\" she tells him. \"We\u0027d just like to know where she is.\"\n Class proceeds as normal, except for Kuk, who fidgets behind his desk, eyes wide and searching, staring out the window. He unnerves the rest of us. Even Bo is discomfited by him and remains quiet, no jokes or digs.\n Towards the end of class, Miss Jaun summons the guard again. He says nobody has seen Kik but they\u0027re still looking.\n I raise a hand. \"Have you tried the D workshops?\" I ask innocently.\n The guard frowns. \"She wouldn\u0027t be there.\"\n \"She might have snuck in.\"\n The guard grins. \"Into the D? I don\u0027t think so. Even I haven\u0027t been inside-I don\u0027t have clearance.\"\n \"But she might be there,\" I insist. I\u0027m holding a steel ballpoint pen, gripping it tight, remembering the conversation I overheard yesterday, Tump saying \"the boy will be hard to keep quiet\".\n \"I\u0027ll check with the guys who were on duty this morning,\" the guard says, rolling his eyes slightly. \"If they\u0027ve seen her, I\u0027ll let you know.\"\n \"Thanks.\"\n The guard leaves. Class ends. Kuk hurries out to search for his sister.\n \"What was that about the D warehouse?\" Bill-E asks, hanging back.\n \"Nothing. I just thought they might not have looked there.\"\n Bill-E squints suspiciously. \"I know you too well, Grubbs Grady,\" he says in a bad Bela Lugosi accent. \"You wouldn\u0027t have said something like that without a reason. What are you hiding from me?\"\n I consider telling him what I heard Tump Kooniart say. But I\u0027m still smarting from my previous humiliation. I don\u0027t want to reveal my fears, only for Kik to turn up, leaving me looking like a paranoid maniac.\n \"It\u0027s nothing,\" I say, unclenching my fist to lay my pen down. \"Let\u0027s...\"\n Grey liquid drips from my hands on to the table. Bill-E pulls a face. \"What\u0027s that?\" he asks. \"It looks like mercury.\"\n I don\u0027t reply. I\u0027m staring at the liquid, the last few drops dripping from my fingers, black ink bubbling on my palms. It\u0027s the remains of the pen. The steel ballpoint which I was holding.\n I melted it.\n Night falls. Kik hasn\u0027t been seen all day. Kuk\u0027s not the only one worried about her now. Her father\u0027s frantic. The search has intensified. The security forces have been deployed in earnest. Davida even suspended shooting so everyone could join the search parties and help.\n I\u0027m with a group exploring the eastern end of town, going through all the real buildings, checking behind the facades of the fakes. Trying to focus on the search. Trying not to think about the pen and how I melted it. But I can\u0027t not think about it. There could be a scientific explanation. But I\u0027m certain the melting had nothing to do with science. It was magic.\n I\u0027m not a natural magician. Dervish told me that only one or two real magicians are born every century. There are others like Dervish and Meera Flame-mages-with the potential to perform acts of magic, usually with the aid of spells. I could maybe do that. But I never have. I\u0027m not keen on magic. Plus, there hasn\u0027t been time. Dervish was a zombie for more than a year and he\u0027s not been up for teaching duties since he recovered.\n So how did I melt the pen?\n There\u0027s only one answer I can think of. When demons enter our universe, they affect the area where they cross. They\u0027re creatures of magic and that magic infects the world around them. When my parents were killed, I was able to tap into the magical, demonic energy and use it to escape. I did it again later in the secret cellar, when I fought Artery and Vein.\n I think that\u0027s happening now. There\u0027s magic in the air-the magic of demons.\n We don\u0027t find Kik. The search concludes after midnight. Everybody turns in. Most people reckon she ran away. The guards say they\u0027ll search for her beyond Slawter tomorrow, take Kuk and his father with them.\n I haven\u0027t told anyone about my fears. No point-I\u0027d only be laughed at. But I can\u0027t sit back and do nothing. I have to try to help Kik, assuming she can still be helped. So I track down Dervish. He\u0027s been searching with Juni and a few others. Him and Juni aren\u0027t an item yet, but they\u0027ve been spending more and more time together, and she\u0027s with him now. He says she\u0027s helping him cope with his nightmares, that she\u0027s taught him how to control his dreams, to keep the monsters of his subconscious at bay. But I think he\u0027s more lustful than grateful-he\u0027s practically bathing in that new aftershave now!\n I get my story straight before I hit Dervish with it. I say I saw Kik yesterday, near the D workshops. Tell him I think she found a way in, that she\u0027s hiding inside, possibly trapped. \"Maybe something fell on her. She could be pinned to the floor, crying out for help, nobody around to hear.\"\n Dervish doesn\u0027t think she could get in-security\u0027s too tight. But Juni says they should check it out. \"It\u0027s the one place we haven\u0027t explored. If she did somehow sneak in and had an accident...\"\n Neither Juni nor Dervish has the authority to enter the D workshops, so we go to Davida. We find her in her office, discussing the next day\u0027s shoot with Chuda Sool. Davida\u0027s tired and irritable-the delay has put the company behind schedule. She hears us out, then shakes her head. \"We already checked. Grubbs mentioned the D earlier, so the guards who were on duty this morning-and last night-were questioned. They all said they hadn\u0027t seen her.\"\n \"But they wouldn\u0027t have if she snuck in,\" Dervish presses.\n \"Impossible,\" Chuda says and I catch him shooting a glare at me. \"There\u0027s no way into the D warehouse other than through the doors. We constructed it to be impenetrable.\"\n \"But-\" Dervish begins.\n \"No!\" Chuda snaps, staring at Dervish directly.\n Dervish stares back at Chuda, his pupils widening. Then he smiles and shrugs. \"Guess we were wrong.\"\n Chuda nods, his eyes still fixed on Dervish. \"I guess you were.\"\n My stomach tenses. It\u0027s not like Dervish to back down so easily. Is Chuda controlling Dervish\u0027s thoughts? Was I right about the browless assistant director? Is he in league with demonic forces?\n Before I can challenge Chuda, Juni speaks up. \"We need to search there,\" she tells Davida. \"Or, if you won\u0027t allow us in, send in a team of guards and tell them to fine-comb the place. Because if Kik is in there-and a determined child can always find a way in, no matter how tight the security- she might be in trouble. If we ignore that and something bad happens to her...\"\n Davida sighs. \"Chuda, assemble a team of guards and-\"\n \"I think you should oversee this personally, Davida,\" Juni interrupts. She smiles sweetly at the glowering Chuda. \"No offence, Mr. Sool, but you\u0027re too convinced the girl isn\u0027t there. You might just take a cursory glance around, then quit.\"\n Chuda bristles angrily and squares up to Juni. Before he can start an argument, Davida says, \"We\u0027ll have no infighting, thank you. Chuda, please assemble a team for me. I\u0027ll go with them into the D workshops and make sure every room and cupboard is scoured methodically. Is that acceptable, Miss Swan?\"\n \"Perfect,\" Juni smiles and we file out. I walk just behind Dervish, studying him carefully, worried about what might be going on inside his head.\n We wait outside the warehouse while Davida and the guards search for Kik. Juni is concerned about Dervish. She asks if he feels all right, if he has a headache. She saw it too, the exchange between him and Chuda. I doubt if she understood it the way I did, but she knows-or senses- something isn\u0027t right.\n It\u0027s after 2:30 in the morning when a yawning Davida and her guards emerge. She shakes her head, exasperated. \"No sign. We checked everywhere.\"\n \"You\u0027re sure?\" I ask.\n Davida doesn\u0027t answer. \"We\u0027ll search the surrounding countryside tomorrow,\" she tells Juni. \"The girl probably had an argument with one of the other children and took off in a huff. Maybe she\u0027ll turn up by herself.\"\n I smother a snort. \"I doubt it!\"\n I set the alarm back an hour and sleep in late. Stare at the ceiling when I wake, tired and grumpy, finding it hard to get out of bed. Wondering what to do about Kik. Ideally I\u0027d like to tell Dervish what I heard Tump Kooniart and Chuda Sool saying. Insist that Emmet was butchered by a demon, and Kik...\n But I spoke to Emmet. He wasn\u0027t killed. Unless...\n You can do just about anything with movie technology or magic. Maybe Chuda Sool was also eavesdropping with Tump Kooniart when I told Dervish and Juni my fears. Perhaps he intercepted the call and faked Emmet\u0027s voice, using either a mechanical or magical vocal distorter. Difficult-but not impossible.\n I grab my trousers from the chair at the foot of my bed, dig my mobile out of the pocket and dial Emmet\u0027s number. There\u0027s no dial tone at his end. His phone\u0027s turned off or he\u0027s somewhere without a signal.\n I get up, dress and head for class. I think about asking Juni for alternate phone numbers for Emmet and his mum, but she\u0027d probably want to know why I was looking for them now. I don\u0027t want to reveal my suspicions to anyone in case I end up a laughing stock again. So, at the end of lessons, I casually ask Miss Jaun if she has Mrs. Eijit\u0027s number. I say I\u0027ve been trying to contact Emmet on his mobile but haven\u0027t been able to get through. Miss Jaun searches her list of names, then calls the number out to me. I thank her and dial it as I head for lunch. Dead, like Emmet\u0027s. I try his number again-the same as earlier.\n It might not mean anything. Then again, it might.\n I try the two numbers several times over the course of the day. Not a peep out of either. I dial directory enquiries and get their home number. Ring it, only to find that the line has been disconnected.\n One last try. I remember Emmet telling us about his local school. Again I use directory enquiries, then call and ask if I can speak with Emmet Eijit. I say I found his mobile phone and want to return it. The secretary says Emmet\u0027s not at school, he\u0027s making a film. I say I thought he\u0027d finished and returned. No, she says, he hasn\u0027t. I ask if she\u0027s sure, if maybe he\u0027s back home, just not at school. She says definitely not, she knows his mother.\n I stare at my phone a long time after that, certain I\u0027ve been tricked. Emmet and his mum are still here, along with Kik-but not necessarily alive.\n Night. Kik hasn\u0027t been found. The search teams return at seven. Kuk and his father aren\u0027t with them. The searchers say Mr. Kane and his son have gone home, in case Kik heads there. I groan when I hear that. I hope it\u0027s true. I pray that it is. Not just because I don\u0027t want Kuk and his dad to be dead-but because if it\u0027s a lie, it means the guards who were with them are part of a cover-up. It means it isn\u0027t just Chuda Sool and one or two others I have to be wary of. I might not be able to trust anybody in the entire cast and crew.\n Filming resumes in the morning. Davida\u0027s still worried about the missing Kik (or claims to be-who can I trust?), but life must go on. A film costs a fortune to make. Every day is vital. She can\u0027t afford to have her team sitting around idle. So, while a selection of guards took off to search the land around Slawter as the sun rose, the cameras rolled as normal.\n They\u0027re filming the second big demon scene tonight. No carnage or loss of life this time. It\u0027s a scene from the third act, in which a demon appears to Bobby Mint and his friends. It predicts doom, warns them of the destruction to come, then tells them they can\u0027t leave, it\u0027s too late, they\u0027re destined to die, along with everyone they care about and love.\n I\u0027ve lost interest in filming but I have to go watch tonight\u0027s shoot, to check out the demon. I\u0027ve heard it\u0027s different to the one that killed Emmet. I wonder if this creature will be real or a model? I know what I\u0027d put my money on!\n A large crowd gathers for the shoot, but not as many as at the first demon show. This scene\u0027s being shot outside a church, one of the fake buildings in Slawter. In the script, the heroes have gathered inside to discuss the demons and what they can do to alert others to the danger. Those scenes have been filmed-or will be-on an interior set. This scene is set at the end of their debate. They\u0027ve just come out. As they\u0027re heading down the steps, the demon appears out of the church behind them, laughing, saying it\u0027s overheard their entire plan.\n Davida sets the scene, runs the actors through their paces, makes sure all the cameras and lights are correctly positioned, then takes her seat. Action!\n I watch nervously, holding my breath, as Salit Smit and the others spill out of the church, faces bright and determined. There are eight steps down from the doors. As they hit the second from bottom step, laughter echoes from within.\n \"Poor, foolish humans,\" the demon crows. Salit and his crew whirl, gasping. \"You think you know so much. But, like all mortals, your knowledge of the world is pitiful. It would be amusing, were it not so sad.\"\n I start to shiver at the first syllable. There\u0027s no mistaking that voice, the low, mournful tone. I know what\u0027s coming next. I\u0027d give anything to be wrong but I know I\u0027m not.\n The demon appears, gliding out of the shadows. He\u0027s lit perfectly. I hear murmurs of approval from the people around me. They were caught by surprise with Emmet, but they\u0027re ready this time, in control of their emotions. Besides, although this demon is more horrific in appearance than the first, he moves so fluidly and gracefully that they have time to appreciate his design, the months of hard work which must have gone into creating him.\n \"You cannot defeat me or my kind,\" the demon says, looking from one so-called hero to another, then beyond, to the crowd watching the filming. \"We can go anywhere you can and to places where you can\u0027t. We see all, hear all, know all. And we will kill all.\"\n A tall demon, pale red skin with lots of cracks in it, from which blood continually oozes. Dark red eyes. No hair or nose. Grey teeth and tongue. A hole where his heart should be, filled with dozens of tiny snakes. Mangled hands at the ends of eight arms. No feet, just fleshy strips dangling from his waist, giving the appearance of thin, misshapen legs. He doesn\u0027t touch the floor, but hovers a few centimetres above the ground all the time.\n \"This is our town now, or soon will be,\" the demon says. \"There is nothing you can do to stop us.\" His eyes fall on me and he smiles widely. \"There is nothing any of you can do-except be slaughtered.\"\n Then he laughs and drifts back into the church. The doors slam shut. A boy in the group of heroes screams. Davida yells, \"Cut!\"\n Everyone pours forward, cheering, congratulating the actors, remarking on how realistic and creepy the demon was, questioning how the effects team got it to hover so believably, what mechanics were involved.\n But there were no strings or engines. It wasn\u0027t a model or costume. The few doubts I had up to this point vanish. We\u0027re in seriously deep trouble. The demon wasn\u0027t speaking from a script. His words weren\u0027t meant for the fictional characters-but for those of us watching.\n There are real demons here. Emmet has been killed, and probably Kik and her relatives too. And it\u0027s going to get worse. Because the monster who wowed the crowd a minute ago is the one who killed my parents and sister, who vowed to kill Dervish, Bill-E and me... the majestic, terrible demon master himself... lowly Lord Loss. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slawter-the-demonata-3/page-7.html","bookId":2177,"book":{"id":2177,"title":"Slawter (The Demonata #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Slawter (The Demonata #3) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
