{"id":101096,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Dervish has another nightmare. Four nights in a row-he must be going for the record. Luckily I\u0027d been expecting this one. Dervish shut himself off from me after Prae Athim left. Kept to his study, pacing around, muttering, brooding. I guessed nightmares would follow. Stayed awake after he went to bed, alert, prepared for a long, active night. I catch Dervish in the hall of portraits. He snuck past my room without me hearing, even though I\u0027d been listening closely. But a minute ago the screaming started and it was easy to track him down. The walls of this hall are lined with photographs and paintings of dead family members, mostly teenagers who became werewolves. It\u0027s on the first floor, close to my bedroom. When I arrive, Dervish has knocked several photos to the floor and is wrestling with a large portrait, trying to tear it free of its peg. \"Leave me alone!\" he screams. \"It\u0027s not my fault!\" \"Dervish,\" I call, hurrying over to him, grabbing his right hand, trying to prise his fingers loose. \"Derveeshio! Derv on a curve-don\u0027t lose your verve. Don\u0027t roar and bawl-not in this hall.\" He ignores the rhymes and jerks free. \"Get out of my skull! You\u0027re eating my brain!\" He collapses to his knees, grips his head hard with both hands, moans with pain and terror. \"Dervish, easy, it\u0027s OK, it\u0027s coolio, you have to chill. You on the ground-everything\u0027s sound.\" His eyes fix on a nearby photograph. His breath catches. \"I didn\u0027t do it!\" he gasps. \"I didn\u0027t kill you! Leave me alone!\" I sweep the photos away, then grab Dervish\u0027s hands, pull them down from his head and lock gazes with him. \"Wake up, you crazy, bald coot! It\u0027s only a dream-no need to scream. None of it\u0027s real-fantasy\u0027s the deal. You have to snap back. Come on, I know you\u0027re in there, I know...\" His expression clears. He looks like a lost child for a few seconds, pitiful, silently begging me for help. Then the real Dervish surfaces and terror gives way to exhaustion and embarrassment. I release him, nodding slowly and repeatedly to show that everything\u0027s OK, no damage done. Dervish looks around at the photos on the floor. Most are ripped, a couple beyond repair. No glass in the frames. We removed all the glass a few months ago, in case something like this happened. Didn\u0027t want him hurting himself-or me. \"I thought they\u0027d come back to life,\" Dervish says. \"They blamed me. Claimed I was the cause of the curse. They wanted revenge.\" \"It was just a dream.\" \"I know. But still...\" He shivers. \"I could have done without Prae Athim and the Lambs. I didn\u0027t need them now. Not in this state. Why do bad things always come at the worst time?\" \"Forget about her,\" I tell him. \"She\u0027s gone. You ran her off.\" \"Maybe I shouldn\u0027t have. Maybe...\" He coughs, then stands. \"No. That\u0027s the nightmare talking. The Lambs can\u0027t help. They mean well, but in matters like this they\u0027re helpless.\" \"Unlike the Disciples?\" I ask, broaching the mysterious subject for the first time, not sure if it\u0027s the right moment, but curiosity getting the better of me. Dervish shakes his head. \"I\u0027ll tell you about them later. Not now. OK?\" I sniff like it doesn\u0027t matter. Dervish grows thoughtful. \"Billy doesn\u0027t know about the change, Lord Loss, what we did for him. It\u0027s better this way. No point throwing his world into chaos. The Lambs are part of the human world. They\u0027ve no direct experience of the Demonata or magic. They couldn\u0027t learn anything from Billy.\" \"Then don\u0027t worry about it,\" I mutter. \"Go back to bed, get a good night\u0027s sleep, kick the nightmares out the window.\" Dervish laughs. \"If only it was that easy.\" He checks his watch. Yawns. \"But I\u0027ll try to snooze, to keep nurse Grubitsch happy.\" He glances at me. \"If I drop off, I might go walkabout again. You should lock me in.\" \"Nah,\" I smile. \"You\u0027d wreck the room. Don\u0027t worry about it. I\u0027ll sleep with one ear open. I\u0027ll see you don\u0027t come to harm.\" Dervish reaches over, squeezes my hand, then shuffles off for the stairs and bed. I watch until he turns the corner. Stay for a while, thinking about Bill-E, the Lambs, demons, the mysterious Disciples. Then I start clearing up the photos and hanging the less tattered snapshots back on their pegs, knowing I won\u0027t be able to sleep. Tired. Finding it hard to stay awake. My friends want to know if there are any David A. Haym updates, but I only grunt at their questions. Studying Bill-E during lunch. Thinking about him in the hands of the Lambs, strapped to a table, hooked up to banks of electrodes. Can\u0027t let that happen. I faced Lord Loss for my brother. If Prae Athim tries anything with Bill-E, she won\u0027t just have to worry about Dervish and the Disciples-she\u0027ll have to deal with me. Yeah, I know, she\u0027s hardly trembling with terror at the thought of having to go up against a teenager. But I\u0027m big. And I can be nasty. If I have to. A limousine\u0027s parked in the drive when I get home. A chauffeur sits behind the wheel, dozing. No prizes for guessing who the limo belongs to. I hear her as soon as I push open the front doors. She\u0027s in the TV room. A loud voice, high-pitched, very theatrical. She\u0027s talking about one of her earlier movies-it might be Zombie Zest- telling Dervish about the problems she faced trying to get the look of the monsters right. \"...but everybody\u0027s using CGI these days! I don\u0027t like it. The audience can tell. They\u0027re not afraid. It\u0027s psychological. You see a guy in a monster costume, or a cleverly designed puppet, and even though you know it\u0027s not real, you can trick yourself into believing it is. But if you see something that\u0027s the work of a computer, your brain can\u0027t accept it. It doesn\u0027t scare you. I think...\" I walk into the room and cough softly. Davida Haym looks up from where she\u0027s sitting on the couch. A surprisingly normal-looking woman. Fiftyish. Black hair streaked with grey. Pudgy. A warm smile. Purple-rimmed glasses. A bright flowery dress. She looks more like a giggling granny than a horror-movie meister. \"Davida, this is my nephew, Grubbs,\" Dervish introduces us. He\u0027s sitting beside her on the couch, looking a bit overwhelmed-I have the feeling Davida hasn\u0027t stopped talking since she came in. \"Grubbs lives with me.\" \"Hello, Grubbs,\" Davida says, rising to shake my hand. A short woman. Barely comes up to my chest. \"Neat name. Is it short for something?\" \"Grubitsch,\" I mutter. \"I\u0027m a big fan of yours. I thought Night Mayors was the best horror film of the last ten years.\" \"Why, thank you!\" Davida booms, not releasing my hand. \"Although, to be honest, my input wasn\u0027t so great. The director-Liam Fitz-is a real hardhead. Likes to make the creative decisions himself. I set him off, gave him whatever he asked for, but after that...\" She shrugs, still holding my hand. \"And this is June,\" Dervish says, drawing my attention to a third person in the room, sitting in a chair to my left. \"Juni,\" she corrects him, getting up. \"Juni Swan.\" Davida Haym finally releases my fingers and I shake hands with the other woman. She\u0027s small too, but slightly taller than Davida. Thin. Pretty. White hair, very pale skin, pinkish eyes. An albino. Her hair\u0027s tied back in a ponytail. Hard to tell her age because her skin\u0027s so white and smooth. \"Juni is Miss Haym\u0027s assistant,\" Dervish says. \"Davida,\" the producer corrects him. She tuts loudly. \"I don\u0027t stand on ceremony.\" \"And I\u0027m not her assistant,\" Juni says, almost apologetically. She speaks very softly. \"Although I am here to assist.\" \"Let\u0027s sit down,\" Davida says, as if this was her house. She leads us back to the chairs and pats the space on the couch beside her, forcing me to sit with her and Dervish. \"I\u0027ve been telling your uncle about my problems on my other movies. As I\u0027m sure you know-I can tell you\u0027re a horror buff-I love monsters. LOVE them! Fangs, tentacles, bulging eyes, slime... all great stuff, right? Right! But getting them to look real... believable... scare people to the max... that\u0027s hard as hell. But I\u0027m telling you nothing new. You\u0027ve seen loads of terrible monster flicks, I\u0027m sure. Where the creatures are about as scary as a baby in a pram?\" \"Yeah,\" I grin. \"Most horror films are crap. That\u0027s why they\u0027re fun.\" \"I agree!\" Davida shouts. She thumps Dervish\u0027s knee so hard that he gasps. \"I like this kid! He knows his nettles from his roses!\" She turns back to me. \"We all love schlocky horror, where the effects are lame and the monsters tame. I grew up on old Universal and Hammer pictures! And that\u0027s fine. Sometimes you just want to sit down to a corny bit of hokum and have a laugh.\" She raises a finger and lowers her voice. \"But there are times when you don\u0027t want to laugh, right? When you want to be scared, when you want your world turned upside-down, when you want to sit there in the dark and really feel fear bite. Right?\" \"Hell, yeah!\" There was a period, after my battles with Lord Loss and his familiars, when I didn\u0027t enjoy horror. Life was fearful enough. But as the months passed, and the memories of the real horror faded, I rediscovered my love of fictional terror. \"That\u0027s where I want to go with my next movie,\" Davida says, loud again. \"I\u0027ve been off the scene for a while-almost four years since my last film. That\u0027s because I\u0027ve been researching and planning. I want to do something BIG with my next one, not rehash an older story. I want screams, not laughs. I want to go for the jugular and shake audiences up, send them home shivering.\" \"Coolio!\" I exclaim. \"Which is where your uncle comes in.\" Davida smoothes down her skirt and turns her smile on Dervish. \"Will we talk business now or do you want to wait?\" \"Now\u0027s good for me,\" Dervish says. \"OK.\" Davida glances around, to be sure nobody\u0027s eavesdropping. \"I\u0027m about to shoot my new film. Everything\u0027s set. I\u0027m not only producing-I\u0027ve written the script and I\u0027m directing too. Can you imagine? Me-a director!\" She throws her head back and laughs. Dervish and I laugh too, even though we\u0027ve no idea what the joke is. \"I\u0027ve kept the project secret,\" Davida continues. \"I keep quiet about all my films, but I\u0027ve been especially hush-hush on this one. Everyone connected has signed a lips-sealed contract. The monster designs are locked in a state-of-the-art safe, and only two other people beside myself have seen them in their entirety-everybody else gets a small piece to work on. We won\u0027t be shooting in any of the established studios. I\u0027ve created my own, far away from prying eyes. Most people aren\u0027t even aware that I\u0027m at work again-they think I\u0027m sitting on my ass on a beach, twiddling my thumbs, creatively defunct.\" \"Sounds like you\u0027ve given yourself a lot of headaches,\" Dervish says. \"Are you kidding?\" Davida snorts. \"I\u0027m having a ball! It\u0027s the film I\u0027ve always wanted to make. I love intrigue, suspense, secrets. It\u0027s a game, the best in the world, and I\u0027m the only one who knows all the rules. I wouldn\u0027t trade places with anybody right now, not for anything.\" \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re happy,\" Dervish says. \"But I don\u0027t see why...?\" He leaves the question hanging. \"Why I\u0027m telling you?\" Davida looks at me and winks. \"Why I\u0027m telling the two of you.\" She lowers her voice again. I don\u0027t think she\u0027s capable of whispering, but this is as close as she gets. \"What I say now has to remain between us. I haven\u0027t asked you to sign a confidentiality form yet-you\u0027ll have to do it later, if you agree to my offer-but from what I\u0027ve heard, you\u0027re a man of your word. I\u0027m not sure about Grubbs...\" \"I can keep a secret,\" I huff. \"You don\u0027t have to worry about me.\" \"Excellent.\" She gives my right knee a squeeze and almost crushes it. \"So, when I ask you to keep what I\u0027m about to say to yourselves, not tell anybody, even your best friends... can I trust you?\" \"I won\u0027t speak, even under torture,\" Dervish laughs. \"Me neither,\" I back him up. \"Great!\" Davida beams. \"Then listen close and keep it quiet. The film\u0027s called Slawter.\" \"Slaughter!\" I echo. \"Brilliant!\" \"I think so too,\" Davida chuckles. \"Slawter-which is spelt with a \u0027w\u0027 instead of a \u0027ugh\u0027-is the name of the town in the movie. A bit obvious maybe, but I\u0027ve always liked a gruesomely OTT play on words. I think it\u0027ll look great on the posters-\u0027Welcome to Slawter!\u0027 or \u0027Let the Slawter commence!\u0027 \" She squints. \"Maybe we\u0027ll have to work on the tagline, but you get the picture. Now, here\u0027s the good part, the reason I\u0027m here, and the bit I know you\u0027re going to love the best. Slawter is going to be all about... demons!\" She sits back, grinning, and awaits our response, unaware that she\u0027s just dropped the mother of all bombshells. Davida can\u0027t understand why we\u0027re not excited. Doesn\u0027t know what to make of our shifty glances and awkward silence. She keeps talking about the movie. Tells us that demons take over the town of Slawter. She describes some of the characters and scenes. Dervish and I listen stiffly. \"OK,\" Davida finally says, \"what\u0027s wrong?\" She sniffs at her armpits. \"Do I stink?\" Dervish forces a thin smile. \"There\u0027s nothing wrong. It\u0027s just... We\u0027re not fond of demons, are we, Grubbs?\" \"No,\" I grunt. \"Why not?\" Davida asks. \"Demons are the scariest monsters of the lot.\" \"Too scary,\" Dervish mutters, then laughs edgily. Davida frowns. \"But you\u0027re supposed to be a demon expert. The more I research, the more your name crops up. I\u0027ve been told you know all about their ways, their habits, their appearance.\" \"You\u0027re talking about them as if they were real,\" Juni Swan chuckles. \"Of course they\u0027re not real,\" Davida snorts. \"But there have been loads of stories and legends about demons, plenty of descriptions and paintings, and Dervish knows more about them than most. He has some of the hardest-to-find demonic books and manuscripts in the world. Right?\" \"I know more than many, not as much as some,\" Dervish answers cagily. \"What I can say is, demons aren\u0027t to be taken lightly. If you want to make stuff up, go ahead, use your imagination, have fun. But I suspect you want to do more than that.\" \"Damn straight,\" Davida huffs. \"I want the real deal, the fiercest demons on record. I want this to be believable. I\u0027ve got most of what I need-as I said, I\u0027ve been working on this for four years. My demons are ready to go. But I want them to behave realistically. I want to get every last detail right, so even the greatest demon scholar won\u0027t be able to find fault.\" Davida points at Dervish. \"That\u0027s where you come in. I want your expertise, your insight and knowledge. I want you to come on set as an advisor. Tell us when we make mistakes, steer us right, help us pin the images down.\" \"You\u0027ve got the wrong guy,\" Dervish says. \"I know nothing about movies.\" \"There\u0027s a first time for everything,\" Davida insists. \"I\u0027m not saying you look on this as a career move-just a break from the norm. You get to see a film being made... hang out with the actors and crew... tell us what to do when we\u0027re messing up... and the money\u0027s not bad either!\" Juni coughs politely. \"Davida, have you seen this place? I don\u0027t think money is an issue. Correct, Dervish?\" \"I have to admit, I\u0027m not hard up,\" Dervish says, smiling at the pretty albino. \"So don\u0027t do it for the money,\" Davida shrugs. \"Do it for the experience. This is the chance of a lifetime. You could bring Grubbs along too. You\u0027d like to see a movie being made, wouldn\u0027t you, Grubbs?\" \"You bet!\" I reply enthusiastically. Then I remember what the film\u0027s about. \"But demons... they\u0027re... it sounds silly, but...\" I pull a face. \"This is incredible,\" Davida snaps. \"I thought you guys would be dying to get in on this. There are others I can ask if you\u0027re going to be ridiculous about it. I\u0027m not-\" \"Davida,\" Juni interrupts calmly. \"You won\u0027t convince them to get involved by antagonising them. If they don\u0027t want to do it, you\u0027ll have to accept their decision and move on.\" \"I know,\" Davida mutters. \"I just don\u0027t get why they\u0027re turning me down!\" \"It\u0027s nothing personal,\" Dervish says, then looks at Juni. \"What\u0027s your role in this, Miss Swan?\" \"I\u0027m a psychologist. There are lots of children involved in this movie. I\u0027ve been hired to look after them on set.\" \"Do you do a lot of this type of work?\" Dervish asks. Juni shakes her head. \"This is my first time.\" \"I brought Juni along because we\u0027re going to interview a young actor later,\" Davida says. \"I like her to be involved with the kids as early as possible. She can spot a problem child a mile off.\" \"What about problem adults?\" Dervish asks. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027d be any problem,\" Juni responds with a shy smile. \"I\u0027m not so sure about that,\" Davida grumbles. Then she suddenly turns the full force of her smile on Dervish. \"Hellfire, Grady! I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re a problem or not. I want you on my team. What can I do to convince you?\" Dervish starts to say there\u0027s nothing she can do, then hesitates, glances at Juni and frowns. \"Do you have a copy of the script?\" \"No,\" Davida says. \"And I wouldn\u0027t show it to you if I did. But I\u0027ve got some excerpts on disc, along with a rough plot outline and descriptions of some of the demons-I needed something to grab the interest of potential investors. But I don\u0027t like revealing even that much, especially to someone who hasn\u0027t signed a contract.\" \"I understand,\" Dervish says. \"But if I could have a look, I\u0027d be able to tell you whether or not you need me. I don\u0027t want to waste your time or mine. If there\u0027s no reason for me to be there-nothing I can help you with-then...\" Davida doesn\u0027t look happy. \"I have a few copies of the disc,\" she says, nodding at her handbag on the floor. \"They\u0027re digitally protected, so you shouldn\u0027t be able to copy the material or send it to anyone by e-mail. But...\" She thinks it over, then reaches into the bag and produces a boxed disc. \"I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m trusting you with this. You\u0027re not that important to me. But you\u0027re the first person to turn me down on this movie and I don\u0027t like it. People aren\u0027t supposed to say no to the fabulous Davida Haym.\" She laughs shortly, then rises. \"You can have it for twenty-four hours. Juni and I have that interview tonight. We\u0027ll be passing back this way tomorrow. We\u0027ll drop in to collect the disc. I\u0027ll ask-just once-if you\u0027ve changed your mind. If you don\u0027t want to do it, fine.\" She beams at Dervish, nods at me, then heads for the door like a person of noble birth. Juni gets up, smiling. \"She\u0027s a drama queen, isn\u0027t she?\" Juni says when Davida is out of earshot. \"And then some!\" Dervish laughs. \"But she\u0027s sweet,\" Juni says. \"And a natural with the children. She treats them like a mother. Not a bad bone in her body, despite the horrible films she makes.\" Juni starts for the door. Pauses. Looks at Dervish. \"I hope you change your mind. I...\" She stops, clears her throat, smiles quickly and exits. Dervish hurries after her, to see the pair out. I remain in the TV room, staring at the disc on the couch, sensing trouble of the very worst kind, though I\u0027m not sure why.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slawter-the-demonata-3/page-4.html","bookId":2177,"book":{"id":2177,"title":"Slawter (The Demonata #3)","description":"Storyline: Slawter (The Demonata #3) This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
