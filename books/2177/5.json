{"id":99504,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Dervish is humming when he returns. \"Nice people,\" he says.\n \"Especially Juni,\" I note drily.\n \"Yes.\" He picks up the disc and looks at it silently.\n \"What made you change your mind?\" I ask.\n \"I haven\u0027t,\" he says.\n \"But you\u0027re thinking about it, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes. This is probably nothing to worry about, just a filmmaker conjuring up the usual smorgasbord of hysterical fakes. But I got the feeling Davida knows too much for her own good. She wants the film to be realistic. Maybe she plans to dabble where she shouldn\u0027t, use old rites that might backfire. I\u0027m a hard man to find. I\u0027m worried that she was able to root me out. It makes me wonder what else she might know.\"\n \"So you want to check the plot and demon descriptions, make sure there\u0027s nothing dodgy going on?\" I ask. Dervish nods. \"Except I got the impression you only agreed to think it over when Juni smiled at you.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous!\" Dervish protests. \"She had nothing to do with it.\"\n But by the strength of his reaction, and the way he storms out of the room in a huff, I\u0027m sure she did!\n Having shrugged off my foolish sense of unease, I try convincing Dervish to let me have a look at the disc. I want to know what a David A. Haym film looks like at this early stage. But he refuses and locks himself in his study. Back downstairs, I fall asleep on the couch. Wake some time during the night, cold, shivering. Think about hauling myself up to bed, but I\u0027m too lazy. Instead I grab a few pillows and stack them around me for warmth. Starting to drift off to sleep again when I suddenly snap wide awake.\n Dervish is in trouble.\n Not sure how I know-gut instinct. I slide off the couch, scattering the pillows, and race upstairs. Dervish isn\u0027t in his bedroom or study. Nowhere on the second floor. Or the first. I wind up back on the ground floor. A quick scout-no sign of him. That means he either went out... or down to the cellar.\n Before descending, I go to the kitchen and make sure Dervish hasn\u0027t broken into the cutlery cupboard and stocked up on knives. Then I head down the stairs, automatic lights flickering on as I hit the bottom steps. The cellar\u0027s where Dervish stores his wine. I don\u0027t come down here much. Nothing of interest for me.\n Listening to the hum of the lights, watching for shadows, trying to pinpoint Dervish\u0027s position. After a minute I take the final step and explore the rows of wine racks, fists clenched, anticipating an attack.\n I don\u0027t find Dervish in the cellar. Search complete, I want to go back upstairs and try the area outside the house. But there\u0027s one place still to look. It\u0027s the last place I want to try-which makes me suspect that\u0027s where Dervish is.\n One of the walls houses a secret doorway. I make for that now. It\u0027s covered by a giant wine rack, mostly containing normal bottles. But one\u0027s a fake. I find it and press hard on the cork with a finger. It sinks in. The rack splits in two and both halves slide away from each other, revealing a dark, narrow corridor.\n \"Dervish?\" I call. My voice echoes back to me, unanswered.\n I start down the corridor, breathing raggedly. The halves of the wine rack slide back into place. I\u0027m plunged into darkness. But it\u0027s temporary. Moments later, lights flicker on overhead, the glow just strong enough to see by.\n The corridor runs to a secret underground cellar. It\u0027s where Dervish keeps his most magical and dangerous books, where he goes if he wants to practise magic. It\u0027s where we fought Lord Loss all those months ago. Where I almost died.\n I come to a thick wooden door with a gold ring for a handle. The door stands ajar and there\u0027s a pale light coming from within. \"Dervish?\" I call again. No answer. I really don\u0027t want to go in, but I must.\n I push the door all the way open and enter, heart pounding.\n A large room. Wooden beams support the ceiling. Many torches set in the walls, but none are lit. A steel cage in one corner, the bones of a deer lying on the floor within. Two broken tables. A third in good repair. Chess pieces, books, charred pages and other bits of debris brushed up against the walls. A stack of weapons close to the rubbish, lined with dust, riddled with cobwebs.\n And Dervish, squatting in the middle of the room, a candle in one hand, a book in the other.\n I approach cautiously. Freeze when I catch sight of the book. There\u0027s a painting of Lord Loss on the cover. Just his face. And it\u0027s moving. His awful red eyes are widening, his lips spreading. Dervish is muttering a spell, bending closer to the book. Lord Loss\u0027 teeth glint in the light of the candle. His face starts to come off the page, like a 3D image, reaching for Dervish, as though to kiss him.\n I hurl myself at Dervish. Knock him over and punch the book from his hand. The candle goes out. We\u0027re plunged into darkness. Dervish screams. I hear him scrabbling for the book. I thrash around, find Dervish, throw myself on top and pin him to the floor, yelling at him, keeping him away from the book, calling his name over and over, using all my weight to keep him down.\n Finally he stops fighting, pants heavily, then croaks, \"Grubbs?\" I don\u0027t reply. \"You\u0027re squashing me,\" he wheezes.\n \"Are you awake?\" I cry.\n \"Of course. Now get off before...\" A pause. \"Where are we?\n \"The secret cellar.\"\n \"Damn. What was I...?\"\n \"You had a book about Lord Loss. You were chanting a spell. His face was moving. It looked like he was coming alive-coming through.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I... Let\u0027s get some light. I\u0027m awake. Honest. You can get off me. I promise.\"\n Warily I slide aside. Dervish gets to his feet. Stumbles to the nearest wall. I hear him rooting through his pockets. Then he strikes a match, finds the nearest candle and sets it aflame. The room lights up. I see the book, lying facedown. No movement.\n \"Could you have brought him here?\" I ask, not taking my eyes off the book.\n \"No,\" Dervish says. \"But I could have summoned part of his spirit. Given him just enough strength to... hurt me.\"\n \"And me?\"\n \"Absolutely not. You were safe. The spirit couldn\u0027t have got out of this room.\"\n \"But when I came in?\"\n Dervish says nothing. A guilty silence. Then a deep sigh. \"Let\u0027s get out of here. There are things we must discuss.\"\n \"And the book?\" I ask.\n \"Leave it. It can\u0027t do any harm. Not now.\"\n Standing, I stagger out of the room. Dervish follows, leaving the candle burning, shutting the door on the past, trailing me back up the corridor to the safety of the normal world.\n \"The Disciples fight the Demonata and do what we can to keep them out of our universe.\"\n We\u0027re in Dervish\u0027s study. We both have mugs of hot chocolate. Sitting facing one another across the main desk.\n \"We\u0027re all magically inclined,\" Dervish continues. \"Not true magicians, but we have talents and abilities-call us mages if you like. In an area of magic-the Demonata\u0027s universe, or a place where a demon is crossing-our powers are magnified. We can do things you wouldn\u0027t believe. No, scratch that-of course you\u0027d believe. You fought Lord Loss.\"\n \"How many Disciples are there?\" I ask.\n \"Twenty-five, thirty. Maybe a few more.\" Dervish shrugs. \"We\u0027re loose-knit. Our founder is a guy called Beranabus. He is a true magician, but we don\u0027t see a lot of him. He spends most of his time among the Demonata, waging wars the rest of us couldn\u0027t dream of winning.\n \"Beranabus sometimes gives orders, sets one or more of us a specific task. But mostly we do our own thing. That\u0027s why I\u0027m not sure of our exact number. There\u0027s a core group who keep in touch, track the movements of demons and work together to deal with the threats. But there are others we only see occasionally. In an emergency I guess Beranabus could assemble us all, but in the usual run of things we don\u0027t have contact with every member.\"\n \"So that\u0027s your real job,\" I say softly. \"Fighting demons.\"\n He smiles crookedly. \"Don\u0027t misinterpret what I\u0027m telling you. This isn\u0027t an organisation of crack magical heroes who battle demons every week. There are a few Disciples who\u0027ve fought the Demonata several times, but most have never gone up against them, or maybe only once or twice.\"\n \"Then what do they do?\" I frown.\n \"Travel,\" he says. \"Tour the world, watch for signs of demonic activity, try to prevent crossings. Demons can\u0027t swap between universes at will. They need human assistants. Wicked, power-hungry mages who work with them from this side and help them open windows between their realm and ours. Usually there are signs. If you know what to look for, you can stop it before it happens. That\u0027s what we do-watch for evidence of a forming window, find the person working for the demon, stop them before it gets out of hand.\"\n \"You don\u0027t travel around,\" I note. \"Is that because of me?\"\n \"No,\" Dervish smiles. \"I used to travel a lot, but I do most of my work here now, at the command of Beranabus. It s my job to... well, let\u0027s not get into that. It\u0027s not relevant.\"\n Dervish sips from his mug, looking at me over the rim, awaiting my reaction.\n \"What happens when a demon crosses?\" I ask.\n \"It depends on the strength of the demon. Most of the truly powerful Demonata can\u0027t use windows-they\u0027re too big, magically speaking. They need a tunnel to cross-a wider, stronger form of window. They\u0027re much more difficult to open. It\u0027s been centuries since anyone constructed a tunnel.\"\n \"Lord Loss is a demon master,\" I note. \"He crosses.\"\n \"He\u0027s an exception. We don\u0027t know why he can cross when others like him can\u0027t. He just can. There are rules where magic\u0027s concerned, but those rules can be bent. Anything\u0027s possible with magic, even the supposedly and logically impossible.\n \"The other demons who cross are nowhere near as powerful as Lord Loss,\" Dervish continues, \"We drive back the lesser specimens, but we leave the stronger demons alone and try to limit the damage.\"\n \"You let them get away with it?\" I cry. \"You let them kill?\"\n Dervish lowers the mug. \"It\u0027s not as heartless as it sounds. There\u0027s far less magic in our universe than theirs. When they cross, they\u0027re nowhere near as powerful as they are in their own realm. And most can only stay here for a few minutes. Occasionally a window will remain open longer, for an hour or two, but that\u0027s rare. Thankfully. Because if they could cross with all their powers intact, and stay as long as they liked, we\u0027d have been wiped out long ago.\n \"We stop maybe half of all potential crossings,\" Dervish goes on. \"Which is pretty good when you consider how few of us there are. Although we\u0027re only talking six or seven attempts to cross in any given year.\"\n \"So three or four get through?\" I ask.\n \"Approximately. We aren\u0027t always there when one crosses. When we are...\" He sighs. \"If it\u0027s a weaker demon, we try to drive it back. A single Disciple will engage it, occasionally a pair. We don\u0027t like to risk too many in any single venture.\"\n \"And when you don\u0027t think you can stop it?\" I ask quietly.\n Dervish looks away. \"A demon will normally kill no more then ten or twenty people when it crosses.\"\n \"Still!\" I protest. \"Ten people, Dervish! Ten lives!\"\n \"What do you want us to do?\" he snaps. \"There are battles we can\u0027t win. We do what we can- we can\u0027t do any more. We\u0027re not bloody superheroes!\"\n \"Sure,\" I say quickly. \"Sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to sound critical. I just...\"\n \"I know,\" he mutters. \"When I first heard about the Disciples, I was like you. I didn\u0027t want to admit the possibility of defeat or make concessions. But when you see enough people die, you realise life\u0027s not like the movies or comics. You can\u0027t save everyone. It\u0027s not an option.\"\n Dervish falls silent. We never talked much about his past. To be honest, with all the problems I\u0027ve faced over the last couple of years, I haven\u0027t had time to think about anybody else\u0027s troubles. But now that I consider it, I realise my uncle must have seen a lot of bad stuff in his time. We got lucky against Lord Loss. We beat him at his own game and walked away relatively unharmed. But Dervish told me there are more failures than successes when humans battle demons. And if he\u0027s been around for even a few failures... seen people die like I saw my parents and sister die... had to stand by and let it happen because he didn\u0027t have the power to stop it...\n \"I\u0027m telling you this because of Davida Haym,\" Dervish says, interrupting my thoughts. \"I went through her disc earlier. From the outline it sounds like fun-demons run wild and take over a town-but I don\u0027t like it. The few demons she described are very realistic. She mentions rituals you can use to summon them. She\u0027s gathered information cleverly but I don\u0027t think she knows how dangerous that information is.\n \"I\u0027m going to accept her offer to work on set as an advisor. I want to make sure she doesn\u0027t accidentally summon a demon or supply others with the means to. The chances of that happening are slim, and in the normal run of things I wouldn\u0027t bother with her.\n \"But I need to get away from here for a while.\" His eyes are dark, haunted. \"I haven\u0027t been the same since I came back. The nightmares... fear... confusion. Maybe my brain will never properly recover and I\u0027m doomed to live like this until I die. But I\u0027m hoping I can shrug it off. I\u0027ve been living the quiet life-too quiet. I need something to focus my attention. A challenge. Something to sweep away the cobwebs inside my head.\"\n \"But you\u0027re protected by spells here,\" I note. \"You might not be safe outside Carcery Vale. Lord Loss...\"\n \"Remember the book in the cellar?\" Dervish says. \"Unless I dig myself out of this hole, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m safe anywhere.\"\n I nod slowly. \"How long will you be gone?\"\n \"However long the shoot lasts,\" Dervish says. \"I\u0027ll ask Meera to keep an eye on things while I\u0027m away.\"\n \"Meera\u0027s going to be staying with me?\" I ask, not minding the sound of that one little bit-Meera Flame\u0027s hot stuff!\n \"No,\" Dervish says. \"You won\u0027t be here either. Unless you object, I want to take you with me. Billy too.\"\n \"You want to take us on set?\" I yelp.\n \"Davida said I could,\" he reminds me. \"Well, she didn\u0027t mention Billy, but I\u0027m sure that won\u0027t be a problem.\"\n \"Brilliant!\" I gasp, face lighting up. Then doubt crosses my mind. \"But why?\"\n \"Two reasons,\" Dervish says. \"One-I need you to look out for me at night, to help me if the nightmares continue.\" He stops.\n \"And the second reason?\"\n \"I don\u0027t trust Prae Athim and the Lambs. They might pull a fast one if I\u0027m not around.\"\n \"You think they\u0027d kidnap Bill-E?\"\n \"It\u0027s possible. Right now I want Billy where I can protect him, twenty-four seven. I\u0027ll rest easier that way.\"\n \"So we\u0027re going into the movie business,\" I laugh.\n \"Yep.\" Dervish laughs too. \"Crazy, isn\u0027t it?\" He checks his watch. \"Three-thirty in the morning. Ma and Pa Spleen would hit the roof if we phoned Billy at such an ungodly hour.\" He cocks a wicked eyebrow at me. \"Do you want to ring or shall I?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slawter-the-demonata-3/page-5.html","bookId":2177,"book":{"id":2177,"title":"Slawter (The Demonata #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Slawter (The Demonata #3) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
