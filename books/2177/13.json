When I hear that, I know I\u0027m back in the real world-there\u0027s no mimicking a dreadful, pig-choking noise like that! I open my eyes and sit up, groggy, head pounding, utterly confused but no longer ensnared by the dream reality of the laboratory. I\u0027m in a small, dark room, chinks of light sneaking in around the edges of a dusty old set of blinds. Propped up on a bare wooden floor. Dervish and Bill-E spread out next to me. Both asleep. \"Dervish,\" I mumble, shaking him hard. No answer. I shake him again, hissing his name in his ear, not too loud in case anybody\u0027s on the other side of the door. Still no response. I roll up his eyelids with one hand and snap my fingers in front of his eyes with the other. He carries on snoring. You were all dreaming the same thing, the magic part of me whispers. They\u0027re still trapped inside it. They can\u0027t wake themselves. You\u0027ll have to use magic to bring them back. It tells me the words to use. I murmur them softly, feeling magic flow out of me, into my uncle and brother. They stir. Bill-E moans. Dervish grunts something about an armadillo. Their eyelids flicker and they struggle awake. \"What\u0027s happening?\" Bill-E groans. \"Where are we?\" Dervish asks. \"Where\u0027s Prae Athim? Sharmila? Shark? The-\" \"That was bull,\" I cut in, steadying him as he tries to stand. \"Easy. Don\u0027t make any noise. We\u0027re probably under guard.\" \"I don\u0027t understand. What...?\" He stares around, forehead creased. \"It was a dream. The kidnapping, meeting up with the Disciples, the lab. None of that was real. It was all fantasy.\" \"Don\u0027t be crazy!\" Dervish snaps. \"I know the difference between...\" He stops. Thinks about it. His jaw drops. \"Bloody hell. It had me fooled completely.\" \"Me too, for a while. But bits didn\u0027t add up. There were mistakes.\" \"The lab,\" Dervish says slowly. \"It looked familiar. Now I know why-I got the image from Franz Kafka\u0027s book, The Trial.\" \"Kafka?\" I frown. \"It looked like buildings from James Bond movies. And the cells were straight out of Silence of the Lambs.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Bill-E says. \"The cells were like something in a sci-fi flick, all those control panels and lasers.\" \"We provided our own dream variations,\" Dervish says wonderingly. He rises, panting, and leans against a wall until his legs support him. He staggers to the blinds and parts a few slats. Peers out. Then looks at us. \"We\u0027re still in Slawter. We never left. Grubbs is right-it was all an illusion.\" Dervish walks around the room, giving his head time to clear, flexing his legs and arms. \"I forgot how cunning the Demonata are. They\u0027re masters of deception. They found out we were leaving, or they had a barrier in place to stop anyone getting out. Blocked us with magic. Created an insane scenario which seemed logical to us. Since our minds were active and focused on the dream-thinking that was reality-we couldn\u0027t wake up.\" \"Why not simply drug us?\" Bill-E asks. \"They\u0027re demons. They don\u0027t work that way.\" Dervish chuckles. \"I can\u0027t believe I fell for it. Walking on to the planes without tickets. Breezing through customs, nobody asking to see our passports.\" \"I didn\u0027t spot that,\" I wince. \"What about you, Billy?\" Dervish asks. \"Notice anything out of place?\" \"No,\" Bill-E says, scratching his head. \"Although I did think it strange that some of the nurses weren\u0027t wearing any...\" He coughs and blushes. \"They wanted us out of the way,\" Dervish says, \"so they subdued us. They could have killed us, but I guess they want us around for the finale. If Lord Loss is masterminding this, he won\u0027t want to slaughter us while we\u0027re sleeping. He\u0027ll want to make us suffer first, so he can feast on our pain and gloat.\" \"We have to get out of here,\" I pant, getting up, fighting off a wave of dizziness. \"We have to stop them. Get everybody out. Call the Disciples.\" \"What about Juni?\" Bill-E asks, and Dervish and I flinch, only now realising that she isn\u0027t with us. \"They\u0027re probably keeping her in another room,\" Dervish says. \"Why?\" Bill-E frowns. \"I don\u0027t know. It doesn\u0027t matter. There isn\u0027t time to think about it.\" He strides to the door and presses an ear against it. I can tell by Bill-E\u0027s expression that he\u0027s going to push Dervish about Juni. I slip up beside him and whisper, \"Dervish didn\u0027t say it because he didn\u0027t want to freak you out, but Juni\u0027s probably dead. That\u0027s why she isn\u0027t here.\" Bill-E stares at me, ashen-faced. \"But she was in the laboratory...\" \"So were a lot of people. That doesn\u0027t mean anything.\" I squeeze his arm. \"Dervish cares about Juni a lot, but he can\u0027t think about her now. We can\u0027t either. We can hope for the best, and if we\u0027re lucky we\u0027ll find her, sleeping like we were. But if she\u0027s not... if the worst has happened... we have to overlook it. We have ourselves to worry about. And all the others.\" Bill-E trembles, but nods reluctantly. I squeeze his arm again, then help him to his feet. When he\u0027s able to walk, we edge up behind Dervish, who\u0027s still listening intently at the door. \"Anything?\" I ask. \"No. But that doesn\u0027t mean there\u0027s no one there. Or no thing.\" \"We can\u0027t wait in here forever,\" I note. \"True.\" Dervish looks over his shoulder at me. \"Ready to fight?\" I crack my knuckles. \"Damn straight.\" \"Then let\u0027s go for it.\" He turns the handle and slams open the door. Nobody\u0027s outside. We creep along a damp, musky corridor. We\u0027re in one of the town\u0027s original buildings. It hasn\u0027t been renovated. Holes in the walls, rotting floorboards, broken windows. \"How much of that dream world was real?\" I ask Dervish, trying to calm my nerves by focusing on something other than the possibility that we might run into a team of demons any second. \"Sharmila and Shark-do they really exist?\" \"Yes,\" Dervish says. \"And pretty much the way we saw them-or at least the way I saw them. From your viewpoint, was Shark wearing army fatigues? Sharmila a sari? \"Yes.\" \"Then that much we shared.\" Dervish pauses and looks at me. \"How did you know it wasn\u0027t real? What tipped you off?\" \"Lots of little things. But it was when...\" I glance at Bill-E. \"What did you say to Dervish when we broke you out?\" Bill-E thinks a moment. \"I\u0027m not sure. Something like, \u0027Hey, neighbour, what took you so long?\u0027 \" \"I heard you say something else, something you shouldn\u0027t have said. That let me draw the different pieces together.\" \"What did I say?\" Bill-E asks. \"It\u0027s not important,\" I lie, not wanting to tell him that in my version he knew Dervish was his uncle. \"You were clever to break the illusion,\" Dervish says. \"Even if I\u0027d twigged, I\u0027m not sure I could have woken up. A spell like that will normally divert you down another path when you start to suspect something, lead you into the middle of another dream.\" \"Maybe it has,\" I laugh edgily. \"Maybe this isn\u0027t real and we\u0027re still lying on a floor somewhere, asleep.\" Dervish grunts dismissively. \"I\u0027m not that gullible. This is the real world. We\u0027re awake. I\u0027m sure of it.\" But he looks around nervously all the same. Then his gaze settles on me again. \"If we come through this, you and I need to have a talk.\" \"What about?\" \"Magic. You\u0027re doing things you shouldn\u0027t be able to. I want to know how.\" \"No big mystery,\" I shrug. \"I\u0027m just drawing magic out of the air, putting it to good use, like when we fought Artery and Vein.\" \"Hmm,\" Dervish says, unconvinced. He licks his lips and focuses. We\u0027re almost at the back door. I can hear voices outside. But they\u0027re human voices and they fade quickly-people walking past. \"What now?\" Bill-E asks. \"Do we try driving out of town again? \"No,\" Dervish says. \"We have to alert the others. Tell people what they\u0027re up against. They might not believe us, so we\u0027ll have to be firm. Get them out of here, even if we have to force them. Fight if necessary-and I expect it will be. If we\u0027re lucky, we\u0027ll only have to worry about Chuda and his human accomplices.\" \"And if we\u0027re unlucky?\" I murmur. \"Let\u0027s not think about that,\" he says, then opens the door and walks out to face whatever hell awaits.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slawter-the-demonata-3/page-13.html","bookId":2177,"book":{"id":2177,"title":"Slawter (The Demonata #3)","description":"Storyline: Slawter (The Demonata #3) This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
