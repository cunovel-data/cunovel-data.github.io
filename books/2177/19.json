{"id":99517,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"It\u0027s strange, trying to settle back into everyday life, not telling anyone about Slawter, acting like normal people who\u0027ve merely survived a very human tragedy. Bill-E and I lie to our friends, make up stories about the filming, describe the fire and how we were lucky to escape. Not a word about demons.\\n\\n Bill-E stays with us the first few nights, despite the objections of Ma and Pa Spleen. Nightmares galore, both of us. Remembering. Screaming. Crying. Talking with each other and Dervish, trying to cope. Ironically-considering how this all started-Dervish sleeps like a baby. The confrontation with evil was a tonic for him. It blew the cobwebs from his head, helped him out of the bad patch he\u0027d been stuck in. The fighting, the cover-up, getting in touch with the other Disciples, discussing ways to keep the truth secret... All of that was nectar to my uncle. It fired up his engines. He was in his element dealing with the demonic fallout. I\u0027m not saying he enjoyed it, but he needed it. That\u0027s his real work.\\n\\n I wish it was so easy for me, that I could go off, find a demon, have a scrap, purge myself of the bad memories and fears. But I took nothing positive out of what happened in Slawter. I\u0027m just disgusted, tired and afraid. I\u0027m sure it will be years before I can sleep properly. If ever.\\n\\n But the show must go on. The charade has to be maintained. So Bill-E returns to Ma and Pa Spleen. We go back to school. We force ourselves to focus on homework, friends, sports, TV, music, day-to-day life. We pretend that\u0027s all there is to the world, that there\u0027s nothing more frightening in life than a surprise test or saying something stupid in front of your friends and having them laugh at you.\\n\\n And sometimes-just sometimes-I almost believe it, and for a little while I forget about Lord Loss, Davida Haym, Bo Kooniart, Emmet, the demons, the dead. And life is the way it should be, like it is for most people. But the sensation never lasts. It can\u0027t. Because I know the truth. I\u0027ve seen behind the curtain of reality. I know that monsters are hiding underneath a billion beds across the world. And I know that sometimes... more often than we imagine... they come out.\\n\\n \"Time for that talk.\"\\n\\n We\u0027ve been home for nearly three weeks. I\u0027m in the TV room, some comedy show playing on the big screen, not really concentrating. When Dervish sits beside me and speaks, I\u0027m not sure what he\u0027s talking about. Then, as he switches off the TV, I remember. In the middle of the madness he said that if we got out alive, we\u0027d have to have a chat about my magical prowess.\\n\\n \"You were amazing in Slawter,\" Dervish says. \"Magic was pumping through you and you had complete control over it.\"\\n\\n \"I just tapped into the power in the air,\" I shrug uneasily. \"No biggie.\"\\n\\n Dervish smiles. \"Modesty\u0027s becoming, but let\u0027s not bull ourselves-you were on fire. You did things I can\u0027t even comprehend. When I was fighting Lord Loss, I noticed some of the demons trying to get through the hole in the barrier. You kept them back. How?\"\\n\\n \"I established a second barrier around the hole. Demons couldn\u0027t get through it but humans could.\"\\n\\n Dervish chuckles. \"Do you realise how difficult that is? I couldn\u0027t do it. Even when I was in Lord Loss\u0027 realm, at my most powerful, I couldn\u0027t have pulled off something like that. I don\u0027t know many who could.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t like I planned it,\" I say, for some reason feeling edgier the more he praises me. \"I reacted to what was going on around me. The magic told me what to do. I wasn\u0027t in control. I couldn\u0027t do any of it again. I don\u0027t even remember most of what I did.\"\\n\\n Dervish studies me closely, his expression serious. I sense his reluctance to continue-and with a jolt, I guess the reason why and instantly understand why I\u0027ve been so nervous.\\n\\n \"The Disciples are few in number,\" Dervish says quietly. \"We\u0027re always on the lookout for new recruits, but most mages never realise their magical potential. It lies dormant unless they have an encounter with the Demonata. Even then there\u0027s no guarantee that it will develop, that we\u0027ll be able to make use of them.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I say softly.\\n\\n Dervish frowns. \"I haven\u0027t asked you anything.\"\\n\\n \"I know what\u0027s coming. And the answer\u0027s no. Please don\u0027t ask me.\" I look away, trembling, fighting hard not to cry. \"I hate it, Dervish-the demons, the battles, the madness. I don\u0027t want to face Lord Loss or anything like him again. I don\u0027t want to become a Disciple.\"\\n\\n A lengthy silence. Finally Dervish sighs. \"I\u0027d spare you if I could. But there are so few of us and we\u0027re so limited. From what I saw in Slawter, you could be one of the most powerful Disciples ever. You might even...\" He clears his throat. \"You might even be a true magician. Like Bartholomew Garadex.\"\\n\\n \"No way!\" I cry. \"You told me I wasn\u0027t. You said magicians are born that way, that their powers are obvious from birth.\"\\n\\n \"I know. But the way you handled yourself... Maybe I was wrong. Maybe there are late-developing magicians. But even if you\u0027re not a magician,\" he says quickly as I start to protest, \"you are part of the world of magic. No normal person could have done what you did. You have a very powerful, important talent and it would be a crime to deny it. I know you don\u0027t want to involve yourself with the Disciples, but you have to. Some of us believe that the universe creates champions, that a few humans in each generation are given the gift of magic in order to protect this world from the Demonata. If you\u0027ve been chosen by the universe...\" He smiles shakily. \"You can\u0027t say no to a calling like that, can you?\"\\n\\n \"Just watch me,\" I snap.\\n\\n Dervish\u0027s expression darkens. \"You\u0027re acting like a child.\"\\n\\n \"Well, duh! Haven\u0027t you noticed? I am a child! Big for my age, but don\u0027t let size fool you. Try me again when I\u0027m old enough to vote.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t wait that long,\" Dervish says. \"Magic must be nurtured. Every day we hesitate is a day wasted. When you face your next demon, you might-\"\\n\\n \"There won\u0027t be a next!\" I shout. \"Weren\u0027t you listening? I don\u0027t want to join your band of do-gooding Disciples! I said NO!\"\\n\\n \"Unacceptable,\" Dervish replies flatly. \"You have a responsibility. I know it\u0027s hard-I\u0027ve gone through it myself-but you have to be who you are.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know anything!\" I hiss. \"You didn\u0027t lose your family to demons. You didn\u0027t have to fight Lord Loss when you were my age. You haven\u0027t felt the terror of... of...\" I\u0027m breathing hard, hands clenched, tears in my eyes.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t let fear rule your life,\" Dervish says. \"Everyone\u0027s afraid when they face a demon. We learn to mask our fear, but it\u0027s always there, chewing away at us. Fear... doubt... wishes that we weren\u0027t magical, that we didn\u0027t have this cross to bear. I can help you overcome that fear. I can show you the way.\"\\n\\n I stare at him heavily. There\u0027s no point arguing. He really doesn\u0027t understand. I\u0027m not just afraid-I\u0027m horrified. In Slawter I did what I had to. It was an unreal situation and I had no choice but to let the magic wash through me and use it to fight my way out. But I hated the whole experience and I\u0027ve no desire to repeat it. I\u0027m through with the universe of demons. I\u0027ve done more than my fair share. Got the better of them-and saved lives-twice. That\u0027s enough.\\n\\n I start to tell Dervish this, to try to make him see it from my point of view. But all that comes out is a sigh, then a sullen, \"Anyway, it\u0027s irrelevant. I\u0027m not a magician or a mage. It was just a Slawter thing.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wrong. The power is there. We have to develop it. You can\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \"What if it isn\u0027t?\" I interrupt. \"What if I\u0027m just an ordinary kid who did something weird and wild, but is back to normal now? Would you leave me alone then?\"\\n\\n He frowns. \"Yes, of course. If the talent isn\u0027t there, obviously we can\u0027t fan it into life. But it is. It must be.\"\\n\\n \"Look for it,\" I challenge him. \"Can you find out if a person has magic in them or not?\"\\n\\n Dervish nods. \"We can\u0027t in people who haven\u0027t tapped into it, but once someone unleashes their power, it\u0027s always there. I can search for it, find it, prove it to you. I should have done it before, after you fought Vein and Artery, but I wasn\u0027t thinking straight when I returned from my battle with Lord Loss.\"\\n\\n \"Go on then.\" I face him directly. \"You won\u0027t find anything, but if you want to look, feel free.\"\\n\\n Dervish puts his hands on my shoulders. My left arm\u0027s still sore from when it was cut off. I wince, but steel myself and grunt for him to continue. I\u0027m not sure why I\u0027m so confident that he won\u0027t find anything. But I am.\\n\\n Dervish\u0027s eyes close. \"Relax,\" he says. \"You\u0027ll feel a force... an intrusion. Try not to fight it. I\u0027ll get out as quickly as possible.\"\\n\\n I let my eyelids flutter shut. Seconds later I sense a presence, a soft probing, like fingers creeping through the corridors of my brain. I tense against it.\\n\\n \"Relax,\" Dervish murmurs. \"It\u0027s OK. I won\u0027t hurt you. Trust me.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s hard, but I do as Dervish says, opening myself up to him, letting him probe deep... deeper. I feel him closing in on a part of myself which I wasn\u0027t aware of a few months ago. I know that if he finds it, he\u0027ll continue pestering me to become a Disciple. He won\u0027t give up. He\u0027ll keep on and on, and eventually I\u0027ll cave in and let him train me. And that will mean facing the Demonata again. More pain, craziness, terror.\\n\\n Something moves within me. A pulse. A shiver. Hard to define. Like when you think you catch a movement out of the corner of your eye, but you\u0027re not sure, and when you look closely, nothing\u0027s there.\\n\\n My eyes open. Dervish\u0027s forehead is creased, his lips moving. I close my eyes again. Smile faintly and let him continue. Warm now, safe, at ease.\\n\\n Finally Dervish releases me. When I look at him, he\u0027s shaking his head, confused. \"I don\u0027t understand. I was certain. You shouldn\u0027t have been able to... if there was nothing there... if you\u0027re not a mage... It doesn\u0027t make sense!\"\\n\\n \"I assume that means no magic,\" I grin.\\n\\n \"Not even a trace. I thought I was zooming in on it, but then... nothing. I carried on looking, went deeper than necessary, because I was so sure...\"\\n\\n \"You can try again if you want,\" I tell him.\\n\\n \"No point.\" He manages a brief smile. \"It\u0027s either there or it isn\u0027t. I\u0027d have found it if it was. You can\u0027t hide magic, not from those who know what to look for. I was wrong. You were right. You\u0027re clean.\"\\n\\n \"So I don\u0027t have to sign up? The Disciples can struggle on without me?\"\\n\\n Dervish pulls a face. \"I don\u0027t know. The magic isn\u0027t there now, but I suspect, if we placed you in an area of magic again or took you into the universe of the Demonata... Our leader, Beranabus, is more powerful than any of us. He spends a lot of time among demons. Perhaps...\"\\n\\n I feel fear creeping back, but then Dervish scowls. \"No. I\u0027m not going to sign away your life to him. Maybe you\u0027ll choose to go down that path when you\u0027re older. But I haven\u0027t the right to pass that sort of a sentence on you. Beranabus plays rougher than the rest of us. I\u0027ve seen how he treats those closest to him, and I wouldn\u0027t wish it on anyone.\"\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027m free?\" I say hopefully. \"I don\u0027t have to...?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Dervish smiles, warmly this time, pleased for me, even though he\u0027s disappointed not to have found a powerful new recruit. \"Congratulations, Grubbs. You\u0027re ordinary. I hope you enjoy a long, happy, boring life.\"\\n\\n \"Coolio!\" I laugh. Then the pair of us settle back, turn the TV on and spend a few hours surfing channels, chatting about things deliriously unimportant.\\n\\n In my room. Dark. I haven\u0027t turned the light on. Sitting on the end of my bed. Thinking about what happened earlier, Dervish\u0027s probe, what it would have meant if he\u0027d found magic, how awful my life might have been. I should be celebrating the fact that I\u0027m not one of the magical breed. Rejoicing. But I can\u0027t. Because I know that\u0027s a crock.\\n\\n I rise, walk into the bathroom and stand in front of the basin, facing the mirror above it, even though I can\u0027t see it in the darkness. I don\u0027t want to do this. But I have to be sure.\\n\\n I think I outfoxed Dervish. I think there is magic inside me, but it responded to my wishes and hid itself or deflected my uncle\u0027s probe. He said that wasn\u0027t possible, but if you\u0027re powerful enough, maybe it is. I could be wrong-I\u0027m praying that I am-but I\u0027m not sure. And I have to be. Even if nobody else ever knows, I need to.\\n\\n I focus on the light bulb overhead. For a long second nothing happens. The darkness holds. I begin to hope.\\n\\n Then the light comes on. A warm, steady, unnatural light. And the hope dies away as quickly as it was born.\\n\\n I look at my scared reflection in the mirror. Make it disappear, so only the wall behind me is reflected in the glass. Then I let my reflection reappear and the light fade. I stumble back to bed. Lie down on top of the covers. Silent. Shaking. Terrified. Unable to sleep. Certain now-I\u0027m not normal. I tricked Dervish, but I\u0027m part of the world of magic. I can\u0027t escape. The universe of the Demonata will call to the magic within me and suck me back in. I know it will. This isn\u0027t over, not by a long shot.\\n\\n There are no happy endings. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slawter-the-demonata-3/page-19.html","bookId":2177,"book":{"id":2177,"title":"Slawter (The Demonata #3)","description":"Storyline: Slawter (The Demonata #3) \\n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
