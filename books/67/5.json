{"id":1895,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"5:1 [hgb] 不 可 严 责 老 年 人 ， 只 要 劝 他 如 同 父 亲 。 劝 少 年 人 如 同 弟 兄 。 [kjv] Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren; [bbe] Do not say sharp words to one who has authority in the church, but let your talk be as to a father, and to the younger men as to brothers: 5:2 [hgb] 劝 老 年 妇 女 如 同 母 亲 。 劝 少 年 妇 女 如 同 姐 妹 。 总 要 清 清 洁 洁 的 。 [kjv] The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity. [bbe] To the older women as to mothers, to the younger as to sisters, with a clean heart. 5:3 [hgb] 要 尊 敬 那 真 为 寡 妇 的 。 [kjv] Honour widows that are widows indeed. [bbe] Give honour to widows who are truly widows. 5:4 [hgb] 若 寡 妇 有 儿 女 ， 或 有 孙 子 孙 女 ， 便 叫 他 们 先 在 自 己 家 中 学 着 行 孝 ， 报 答 亲 恩 ， 因 为 这 在 神 面 前 是 可 悦 纳 的 。 [kjv] But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God. [bbe] But if any widow has children or children\u0027s children, let these see that it is right to take care of their family and their fathers and mothers: for this is pleasing in the eyes of God. 5:5 [hgb] 那 独 居 无 靠 真 为 寡 妇 的 ， 是 仰 赖 神 ， 昼 夜 不 住 地 祈 求 祷 告 。 [kjv] Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. [bbe] Now she who is truly a widow and without family puts her hope in God, giving herself to prayer day and night. 5:6 [hgb] 但 那 好 宴 乐 的 寡 妇 ， 正 活 着 的 时 候 也 是 死 的 。 [kjv] But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. [bbe] But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she is living. 5:7 [hgb] 这 些 事 你 要 嘱 咐 他 们 ， 叫 他 们 无 可 指 责 。 [kjv] And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless. [bbe] Give orders to this effect, so that no evil may be said of anyone. 5:8 [hgb] 人 若 不 看 顾 亲 属 ， 就 是 背 了 真 道 ， 比 不 信 的 人 还 不 好 。 不 看 顾 自 己 家 里 的 人 ， 更 是 如 此 。 [kjv] But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. [bbe] If anyone has no care for his family and those in his house, he is false to the faith, and is worse than one who has no faith. 5:9 [hgb] 寡 妇 记 在 册 子 上 ， 必 须 年 纪 到 六 十 岁 ， 从 来 只 作 一 个 丈 夫 的 妻 子 ， [kjv] Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, [bbe] Let no woman be numbered among the widows who is under sixty years old, and only if she has been the wife of one man, 5:10 [hgb] 又 有 行 善 的 名 声 ， 就 如 养 育 儿 女 ， 接 待 远 人 ， 洗 圣 徒 的 脚 ， 救 济 遭 难 的 人 ， 竭 力 行 各 样 善 事 。 [kjv] Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints\u0027 feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work. [bbe] And if witness is given of her good works; if she has had the care of children, if she has been kind to travellers, washing the feet of the saints, helping those who are in trouble, giving herself to good works. 5:11 [hgb] 至 于 年 轻 的 寡 妇 ， 就 可 以 辞 她 。 因 为 她 们 的 情 欲 发 动 ， 违 背 基 督 的 时 候 ， 就 想 要 嫁 人 。 [kjv] But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; [bbe] But to the younger widows say No: for when their love is turned away from Christ, they have a desire to be married; 5:12 [hgb] 她 们 被 定 罪 ， 是 因 废 弃 了 当 初 所 许 的 愿 。 [kjv] Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. [bbe] And they are judged because they have been false to their first faith; 5:13 [hgb] 并 且 她 们 又 习 惯 懒 惰 ， 挨 家 闲 游 。 不 但 是 懒 惰 ， 又 说 长 道 短 ， 好 管 闲 事 ， 说 些 不 当 说 的 话 。 [kjv] And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. [bbe] And they get into the way of doing no work, going about from house to house; and not only doing no work, but talking foolishly, being over-interested in the business of others, saying things which they have no right to say. 5:14 [hgb] 所 以 我 愿 意 年 轻 的 寡 妇 嫁 人 ， 生 养 儿 女 ， 治 理 家 务 ， 不 给 敌 人 辱 骂 的 把 柄 。 [kjv] I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. [bbe] So it is my desire that the younger widows may be married and have children, controlling their families, and giving the Evil One no chance to say anything against them, 5:15 [hgb] 因 为 已 经 有 转 去 随 从 撒 但 的 。 [kjv] For some are already turned aside after Satan. [bbe] For even now some are turned away to Satan. 5:16 [hgb] 信 主 的 妇 女 ， 若 家 中 有 寡 妇 ， 自 己 就 当 救 济 她 们 ， 不 可 累 着 教 会 ， 好 使 教 会 能 救 济 那 真 无 倚 靠 的 寡 妇 。 [kjv] If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed. [bbe] If any woman of the faith has relations who are widows, let her give them help, so that the care of them does not come on the church, and so it may give help to those who are truly widowed. 5:17 [hgb] 那 善 于 管 理 教 会 的 长 老 ， 当 以 为 配 受 加 倍 的 敬 奉 。 那 劳 苦 传 道 教 导 人 的 ， 更 当 如 此 。 [kjv] Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. [bbe] Let rulers whose rule is good be honoured twice over, specially those whose work is preaching and teaching. 5:18 [hgb] 因 为 经 上 说 ， 牛 在 场 上 踹 谷 的 时 候 ， 不 可 笼 住 它 的 嘴 。 又 说 ， 工 人 得 工 价 是 应 当 的 。 [kjv] For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward. [bbe] For the Writings say, It is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it. And, The worker has a right to his reward. 5:19 [hgb] 控 告 长 老 的 呈 子 ， 非 有 两 三 个 见 证 就 不 要 收 。 [kjv] Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses. [bbe] Do not take as true any statement made against one in authority, but only if two or three give witness to it. 5:20 [hgb] 犯 罪 的 人 ， 当 在 众 人 面 前 责 备 他 ， 叫 其 余 的 人 也 可 以 惧 怕 。 [kjv] Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. [bbe] Say sharp words to sinners when all are present, so that the rest may be in fear. 5:21 [hgb] 我 在 神 和 基 督 耶 稣 并 蒙 拣 选 的 天 使 面 前 嘱 咐 你 ， 要 遵 守 这 些 话 ， 不 可 存 成 见 ， 行 事 也 不 可 有 偏 心 。 [kjv] I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. [bbe] I give you orders before God and Christ Jesus and the angels of God\u0027s selection, to keep these orders without giving thought to one side more than another. 5:22 [hgb] 给 人 行 按 手 的 礼 ， 不 可 急 促 。 不 要 在 别 人 的 罪 上 有 分 。 要 保 守 自 己 清 洁 。 [kjv] Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men\u0027s sins: keep thyself pure. [bbe] Do not put hands on any man without thought, and have no part in other men\u0027s sins: keep yourself clean. 5:23 [hgb] 因 你 胃 口 不 清 ， 屡 次 患 病 ， 再 不 要 照 常 喝 水 ， 可 以 稍 微 用 点 酒 。 [kjv] Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach\u0027s sake and thine often infirmities. [bbe] Do not take only water as your drink, but take a little wine for the good of your stomach, and because you are frequently ill. 5:24 [hgb] 有 些 人 的 罪 是 明 显 的 ， 如 同 先 到 审 判 案 前 。 有 些 人 的 罪 是 随 后 跟 了 去 的 。 [kjv] Some men\u0027s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after. [bbe] The sins of some men are clearly seen, going before them to be judged; but with others, their sins go after them. 5:25 [hgb] 这 样 ， 善 行 也 有 明 显 的 。 那 不 明 显 的 ， 也 不 能 隐 藏 。 [kjv] Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. [bbe] In the same way, there are good works which are clearly seen; and those which are not so, may not be kept secret.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/177/2326.html","bookId":67,"book":{"id":67,"title":"提摩太前书 1 Timothy","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 奉 我 们 救 主 神 ， 和 我 们 的 盼 望 基 督 耶 稣 之 命 ， 作 基 督 耶 稣 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， [kjv] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is ou...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/177","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
