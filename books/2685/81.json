I have never seen a gibbon before and I don’t particularly want to see one now, so it’s basically a rather unilluminating experience. I sit on another bench and wait for Bruce, the sun beating down through haze, breaking it up, swirling it around, and it dawns on me that Bruce might not leave Grace and it also dawns on me that I might fall in love with someone else and I might even leave college and head for England or at least the East Coast. A lot of things might keep me away from Bruce. In fact, the odds look pretty good that something will. But I can’t help it, I think to myself as we leave the zoo and get back into my red BMW and he starts it up, I have faith in this man.\n The End \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-informers/page-81.html","bookId":2685,"book":{"id":2685,"title":"The Informers","description":"Storyline: \n Set in Los Angeles, in the recent past.
