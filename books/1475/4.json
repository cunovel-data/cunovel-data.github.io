{"id":14143,"no":4,"title":"IV THE MAN WITHIN HIM","content":"They used to do it much more picturesquely. They rode in coats of scarlet, in the crisp, clear morning, to the winding of horns and the baying of hounds, to the thud-thud of hoofs, and the crackle of underbrush. Across fresh-plowed fields they went, crashing through forest paths, leaping ditches, taking fences, scrambling up the inclines, pelting down the hillside, helter-skelter, until, panting, wide-eyed, eager, blood-hungry, the hunt closed in at the death. \\n\\n \\n\\n The scarlet coat has sobered down to the somber gray and the snuffy brown of that unromantic garment known as the business suit. The winding horn is become a goblet, and its notes are the tinkle of ice against glass. The baying of hounds has harshened to the squawk of the motor siren. The fresh-plowed field is a blue print, the forest maze a roll of plans and specifications. Each fence is a business barrier. Every ditch is of a competitor\u0027s making, dug craftily so that the clumsy-footed may come a cropper. All the romance is out of it, all the color, all the joy. But two things remain the same: The look in the face of the hunter as he closed in on the fox is the look in the face of him who sees the coveted contract lying ready for the finishing stroke of his pen. And his words are those of the hunter of long ago as, eyes a-gleam, teeth bared, muscles still taut with the tenseness of the chase, he waves the paper high in air and cries, \"I\u0027ve made a killing!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For two years Jock McChesney had watched the field as it swept by in its patient, devious, cruel game of Hunt the Contract. But he had never been in at the death. Those two years had taught him how to ride; to take a fence; to leap a ditch. He had had his awkward bumps, and his clumsy falls. He had lost his way more than once. But he had always groped his way back again, stumblingly, through the dusk. Jock McChesney was the youngest man on the Berg, Shriner Advertising Company\u0027s big staff of surprisingly young men. So young that the casual glance did not reveal to you the marks that the strain of those two years had left on his boyish face. But the marks were there. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nature etches with the most delicate of points. She knows the cunning secret of light and shadow. You scarcely realize that she has been at work. A faint line about the mouth, a fairy tracing at the corners of the eyes, a mere vague touch just at the nostrils—and the thing is done. \\n\\n \\n\\n Even Emma McChesney\u0027s eyes—those mother-eyes which make the lynx seem a mole—had failed to note the subtle change. Then, suddenly, one night, the lines leaped out at her. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were seated at opposite sides of the book-littered library table in the living-room of the cheerful up-town apartment which was the realization of the nightly dream which Mrs. Emma McChesney had had in her ten years on the road for the T.A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company. Jock McChesney\u0027s side of the big table was completely covered with the mass of copy-paper, rough sketches, photographs and drawings which make up an advertising lay-out. He was bent over the work, absorbed, intent, his forearms resting on the table. Emma McChesney glanced up from her magazine just as Jock bent forward to reach a scrap of paper that had fluttered away. The lamplight fell full on his face. And Emma McChesney saw. The hand that held the magazine fell to her lap. Her lips were parted slightly. She sat very quietly, her eyes never leaving the face that frowned so intently over the littered table. The room had been very quiet before—Jock busy with his work, his mother interested in her magazine. But this silence was different. There was something electric in it. It was a silence that beats on the brain like a noise. Jock McChesney, bent over his work, heard it, felt it, and, oppressed by it, looked up suddenly. He met those two eyes opposite. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Spooks? Or is it my godlike beauty which holds you thus? Or is my face dirty?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Emma McChesney did not smile. She laid her magazine on the table, face down, and leaned forward, her staring eyes still fixed on her son\u0027s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here, young \u0027un. Are you working too hard?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me? Now? This stuff you mean—?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; I mean in the last year. Are they piling it up on you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock laughed a laugh that was nothing less than a failure, so little of real mirth did it contain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Piling it up! Lord, no! I wish they would. That\u0027s the trouble. They don\u0027t give me a chance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A chance! Why, that\u0027s not true, son. You\u0027ve said yourself that there are men who have been in the office three times as long as you have, who never have had the opportunities that they\u0027ve given you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was as though she had touched a current that thrilled him to action. He pushed back his chair and stood up, one hand thrust into his pocket, the other passing quickly over his head from brow to nape with a quick, nervous gesture that was new to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And why!\" he flung out. \"Why! Not because they like the way I part my hair. They don\u0027t do business that way up there. It\u0027s because I\u0027ve made good, and those other dubs haven\u0027t. That\u0027s why. They\u0027ve let me sit in at the game. But they won\u0027t let me take any tricks. I\u0027ve been an apprentice hand for two years now. I\u0027m tired of it. I want to be in on a killing. I want to taste blood. I want a chance at some of the money—real money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Emma McChesney sat back in her chair and surveyed the angry figure before her with quiet, steady eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I might have known that only one thing could bring those lines into your face, son.\" She paused a moment. \"So you want money as badly as all that, do you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock\u0027s hand came down with a thwack on the papers before him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Want it! You just bet I want it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do I know her?\" asked Emma McChesney quietly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock stopped short in his excited pacing up and down the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know—Why, I didn\u0027t say there—What makes you think that—?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When a youngster like you, whose greatest worry has been whether Harvard\u0027ll hold \u0027em again this year, with Baxter out, begins to howl about not being appreciated in business, and to wear a late fall line of wrinkles where he has been smooth before, I feel justified in saying, \u0027Do I know her?\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it isn\u0027t any one—at least, it isn\u0027t what you mean you think it is when you say you—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Careful there! You\u0027ll trip. Never you mind what I mean I think it is when I say. Count ten, and then just tell me what you think you mean.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock passed his hand over his head again with that nervous little gesture. Then he sat down, a little wearily. He stared moodily down at the pile of papers before him: His mother faced him quietly across the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Grace Galt\u0027s getting twice as much as I am,\" Jock broke out, with savage suddenness. \"The first year I didn\u0027t mind. A fellow gets accustomed, these days, to see women breaking into all the professions and getting away with men-size salaries. But her pay check doubles mine—more than doubles it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s been my experience,\" observed Emma McChesney, \"that when a firm condescends to pay a woman twice as much as a man, that means she\u0027s worth six times as much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A painful red crept into Jock\u0027s face. \"Maybe. Two years ago that would have sounded reasonable to me. Two years ago, when I walked down Broadway at night, a fifty-foot electric sign at Forty-second was just an electric sign to me. Just part of the town\u0027s decoration like the chorus girls, and the midnight theater crowds. Now—well, now every blink of every red and yellow globe is crammed full of meaning. I know the power that advertising has; how it influences our manners, and our morals, and our minds, and our health. It regulates the food we eat, and the clothes we wear, and the books we read, and the entertainment we seek. It\u0027s colossal, that\u0027s what it is! It\u0027s—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keep on like that for another two years, sonny, and no business banquet will be complete without you. The next thing you know you\u0027ll be addressing the Y.M.C.A. advertising classes on The Young Man in Business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock laughed a rueful little laugh. \"I didn\u0027t mean to make a speech. I was just trying to say that I\u0027ve served my apprenticeship. It hurts a fellow\u0027s pride. You can\u0027t hold your head up before a girl when you know her salary\u0027s twice yours, and you know that she knows it. Why look at Mrs. Hoffman, who\u0027s with the Dowd Agency. Of course she\u0027s a wonder, even if her face does look like the fifty-eighth variety. She can write copy that lifts a campaign right out of the humdrum class, and makes it luminous. Her husband works in a bank somewhere. He earns about as much as Mrs. Hoffman pays the least of her department subordinates. And he\u0027s so subdued that he side-steps when he walks, and they call him the human jelly-fish.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Emma McChesney was regarding her son with a little puzzled frown. Suddenly she reached out and tapped the topmost of the scribbled sheets strewn the length of Jock\u0027s side of the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s all this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock tipped back his chair and surveyed the clutter before him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That,\" said he, \"is what is known on the stage as \u0027the papers.\u0027 And it\u0027s the real plot of this piece.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"M-m-m—I thought so. Just favor me with a scenario, will you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Half-grinning, half-serious, Jock stuck his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat, and began. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Scene: Offices of the Berg, Shriner Advertising Company. Time, the present. Characters: Jock McChesney, handsome, daring, brilliant—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Suppose you—er—skip the characters, however fascinating, and get to the action.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock McChesney brought the tipped chair down on all-fours with a thud, and stood up. The grin was gone. He was as serious as he had been in the midst of his tirade of five minutes before. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right. Here it is. And don\u0027t blame me if it sounds like cheap melodrama. This stuff,\" and he waved a hand toward the paper-laden table, \"is an advertising campaign plan for the Griebler Gum Company, of St. Louis. Oh, don\u0027t look impressed. The office hasn\u0027t handed me any such commission. I just got the idea like a flash, and I\u0027ve been working it out for the last two weeks. It worked itself out, almost—the way a really scorching idea does, sometimes. This Griebler has been advertising for years. You know the Griebler gum. But it hasn\u0027t been the right sort of advertising. Old Griebler, the original gum man, had fogy notions about advertising, and as long as he lived they had to keep it down. He died a few months ago—you must have read of it. Left a regular mint. Ben Griebler, the oldest son, started right in to clean out the cobwebs. Of course the advertising end of it has come in for its share of the soap and water. He wants to make a clean sweep of it. Every advertising firm in the country has been angling for the contract. It\u0027s going to be a real one. Two-thirds of the crowd have submitted plans. And that\u0027s just where my kick comes in. The Berg, Shriner Company makes it a rule never to submit advance plans.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Excuse me if I seem a trifle rude,\" interrupted Mrs. McChesney, \"but I\u0027d like to know where you think you\u0027ve been wronged in this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Right here!\" replied Jock, and he slapped his pocket, \"and here,\" he pointed to his head. \"Two spots so vital that they make old Achilles\u0027s heel seem armor-plated. Ben Griebler is one of the show-me kind. He wants value received for money expended, and while everybody knows that he has a loving eye on the Berg, Shriner crowd, he won\u0027t sign a thing until he knows what he\u0027s getting. A firm\u0027s record, standing, staff, equipment, mean nothing to him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Jock, I still don\u0027t see—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock gathered up a sheaf of loose papers and brandished them in the air. \"This is where I come in. I\u0027ve got a plan here that will fetch this Griebler person. Oh, I\u0027m not dreaming. I outlined it for Sam Hupp, and he was crazy about it. Sam Hupp had some sort of plan outlined himself. But he said this made his sound as dry as cigars in Denver. And you know yourself that Sam Hupp\u0027s copy is so brilliant that he could sell brewery advertising to a temperance magazine.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Emma McChesney stood up. She looked a little impatient, and a trifle puzzled. \"But why all this talk! I don\u0027t get you. Take your plan to Mr. Berg. If it\u0027s what you think it is he\u0027ll see it quicker than any other human being, and he\u0027ll probably fall on your neck and invest you in royal robes and give you a mahogany desk all your own.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, what\u0027s the good!\" retorted Jock disgustedly. \"This Griebler has an appointment at the office to-morrow. He\u0027ll be closeted with the Old Man. They\u0027ll call in Hupp. But never a plan will they reveal. It\u0027s against their code of ethics. Ethics! I\u0027m sick of the word. I suppose you\u0027d say I\u0027m lucky to be associated with a firm like that, and I suppose I am. But I wish in the name of all the gods of Business that they weren\u0027t so bloomin\u0027 conservative. Ethics! They\u0027re all balled up in \u0027em, like Henry James in his style.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Emma McChesney came over from her side of the table and stood very close to her son. She laid one hand very lightly on his arm and looked up into the sullen, angry young face. \\n\\n \u0027She laid one hand very lightly on his arm and looked up into the sullen, angry young face\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve seen older men than you are, Jock, and better men, and bigger men, wearing that same look, and for the same reason. Every ambitious man or woman in business wears it at one time or another. Sooner or later, Jock, you\u0027ll have your chance at the money end of this game. If you don\u0027t care about the thing you call ethics, it\u0027ll be sooner. If you do care, it will be later. It rests with you, but it\u0027s bound to come, because you\u0027ve got the stuff in you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe,\" replied Jock the cynical. But his face lost some of its sullenness as he looked down at that earnest, vivid countenance up-turned to his. \"Maybe. It sounds all right, Mother—in the story books. But I\u0027m not quite solid on it. These days it isn\u0027t so much what you\u0027ve got in you that counts as what you can bring out. I know the young man\u0027s slogan used to be \u0027Work and Wait,\u0027 or something pretty like that. But these days they\u0027ve boiled it down to one word—\u0027Produce\u0027!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The marvel of it is that there aren\u0027t more of \u0027em,\" observed Emma McChesney sadly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"More what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"More lines. Here,\"—she touched his forehead,—\"and here,\"—she touched his eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lines!\" Jock swung to face a mirror. \"Good! I\u0027m so infernally young-looking that no one takes me seriously. It\u0027s darned hard trying to convince people you\u0027re a captain of finance when you look like an errand boy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n From the center of the room Mrs. McChesney watched the boy as he surveyed himself in the glass. And as she gazed there came a frightened look into her eyes. It was gone in a minute, and in its place came a curious little gleam, half amused, half pugnacious. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jock McChesney, if I thought that you meant half of what you\u0027ve said to-night about honor, and ethics, and all that, I\u0027d—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Spank me, I suppose,\" said the young six-footer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" and all the humor had fled, \"I—Jock, I\u0027ve never said much to you about your father. But I think you know that he was what he was to the day of his death. You were just about eight when I made up my mind that life with him was impossible. I said then—and you were all I had, son—that I\u0027d rather see you dead than to have you turn out to be a son of your father. Don\u0027t make me remember that wish, Jock.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two quick steps and his arms were about her. His face was all contrition. \"Why—Mother! I didn\u0027t mean—You see this is business, and I\u0027m crazy to make good, and it\u0027s such a fight—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t I know it?\" demanded Emma McChesney. \"I guess your mother hasn\u0027t been sitting home embroidering lunchcloths these last fifteen years.\" She lifted her head from the boy\u0027s shoulder. \"And now, son, considering me, not as your doting mother, but in my business capacity as secretary of the T.A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company, suppose you reveal to me the inner workings of this plan of yours. I\u0027d like to know if you really are the advertising wizard that you think you are.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So it was that long after Annie\u0027s dinner dishes had ceased to clatter in the kitchen; long after she had put her head in at the door to ask, \"Aigs \u0027r cakes for breakfast?\" long after those two busy brains should have rested in sleep, the two sat at either side of the light-flooded table, the face of one glowing as he talked, the face of the other sparkling as she listened. And at midnight: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, you infant wonder!\" exclaimed Emma McChesney. \\n\\n \\n\\n At nine o\u0027clock next morning when Jock McChesney entered the offices of the Berg, Shriner Advertising Company he carried a flat, compact bundle of papers under his arm encased in protecting covers of pasteboard, and further secured by bands of elastic. This he carried to his desk, deposited in a drawer, and locked the drawer. \\n\\n \\n\\n By eleven o\u0027clock the things which he had predicted the night before had come to pass. A plump little man, with a fussy manner and Western clothes had been ushered into Bartholomew Berg\u0027s private office. Instinct told him that this was Griebler. Jock left his desk and strolled up to get the switchboard operator\u0027s confirmation of his guess. Half an hour later Sam Hupp hustled by and disappeared into the Old Man\u0027s sanctum. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock fingered the upper left-hand drawer of his desk. The maddening blankness of that closed door! If only he could find some excuse for walking into that room—any old excuse, no matter how wild!—just to get a chance at it— \\n\\n \\n\\n His telephone rang. He picked up the receiver, his eye on the closed door, his thoughts inside that room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Berg wants to see you right away,\" came the voice of the switchboard operator. \\n\\n \\n\\n Something seemed to give way inside—something in the region of his brain—no, his heart—no, his lungs— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, can you beat that!\" said Jock McChesney aloud, in a kind of trance of joy. \"Can—you—beat—that!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he buttoned the lower button of his coat, shrugged his shoulders with an extra wriggle at the collar (the modern hero\u0027s method of girding up his loins), and walked calmly into Bartholomew Berg\u0027s very private office. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the second that elapsed between the opening and the closing of the door Jock\u0027s glance swept the three men—Bartholomew Berg, quiet, inscrutable, seated at his great table-desk; Griebler, lost in the depths of a great leather chair, smoking fussily and twitching with a hundred little restless, irritating gestures; Sam Hupp, standing at the opposite side of the room, hands in pockets, attitude argumentative. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is Mr. McChesney,\" said Bartholomew Berg. \"Mr. Griebler, McChesney.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock came forward, smiling that charming smile of his. \"Mr. Griebler,\" he said, extending his hand, \"this is a great pleasure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hm!\" growled Ben Griebler, \"I didn\u0027t know they picked \u0027em so young.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His voice was a piping falsetto that somehow seemed to match his restless little eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock thrust his hands hurriedly into his pockets. He felt his face getting scarlet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re—ah—using \u0027em young this year,\" said Bartholomew Berg. His voice sounded bigger, and smoother, and pleasanter than ever in contrast with that other\u0027s shrill tone. \"I prefer \u0027em young, myself. You\u0027ll never catch McChesney using \u0027in the last analysis\u0027 to drive home an argument. He has a new idea about every nineteen minutes, and every other one\u0027s a good one, and every nineteenth or so\u0027s an inspiration.\" The Old Man laughed one of his low, chuckling laughs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hm—that so?\" piped Ben Griebler. \"Up in my neck of the woods we aren\u0027t so long on inspiration. We\u0027re just working men, and we wear working clothes—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, now,\" protested Berg, his eyes twinkling, \"McChesney\u0027s necktie and socks and handkerchief may form one lovely, blissful color scheme, but that doesn\u0027t signify that his advertising schemes are not just as carefully and artistically blended.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ben Griebler looked shrewdly up at Jock through narrowed lids. \"Maybe. I\u0027ll talk to you in a minute, young man—that is—\" he turned quickly upon Berg—\"if that isn\u0027t against your crazy principles, too?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, not at all,\" Bartholomew Berg assured him. \"Not at all. You do me an injustice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Griebler moved up closer to the broad table. The two fell into a low-voiced talk. Jock looked rather helplessly around at Sam Hupp. That alert gentleman was signaling him frantically with head and wagging finger. Jock crossed the big room to Hupp\u0027s side. The two moved off to a window at the far end. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Give heed to your Unkie,\" said Sam Hupp, talking very rapidly, very softly, and out of one corner of his mouth. \"This Griebler\u0027s looking for an advertising manager. He\u0027s as pig-headed as a—a—well, as a pig, I suppose. But it\u0027s a corking chance, youngster, and the Old Man\u0027s just recommended you—strong. Now—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me—!\" exploded Jock. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shut up!\" hissed Hupp. \"Two or three years with that firm would be the making of you—if you made good, of course. And you could. They want to move their factory here from St. Louis within the next few years. Now listen. When he talks to you, you play up the keen, alert stuff with a dash of sophistication, see? If you can keep your mouth shut and throw a kind of a canny, I-get-you, look into your eyes, all the better. He\u0027s gabby enough for two. Try a line of talk that is filled with the fire and enthusiasm of youth, combined with the good judgment and experience of middle age, and you\u0027ve—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, look here,\" stammered Jock. \"Even if I was Warfield enough to do all that, d\u0027you honestly think—me an advertising manager!—with a salary that Griebler—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You nervy little shrimp, go in and win. He\u0027ll pay five thousand if he pays a cent. But he wants value for money expended. Now I\u0027ve tipped you off. You make your killing—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, McChesney!\" called Bartholomew Berg, glancing round. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir!\" said Jock, and stood before him in the same moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Griebler is looking for a competent, enthusiastic, hard-working man as advertising manager. I\u0027ve spoken to him of you. I know what you can do. Mr. Griebler might trust my judgment in this, but—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll trust my own judgment,\" snapped Ben Griebler. \"It\u0027s good enough for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well,\" returned Bartholomew Berg suavely. \"And if you decide to place your advertising future in the hands of the Berg, Shriner Company—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now look here,\" interrupted Ben Griebler again. \"I\u0027ll tie up with you people when you\u0027ve shaken something out of your cuffs. I\u0027m not the kind that buys a pig in a poke. We\u0027re going to spend money—real money—in this campaign of ours. But I\u0027m not such a come-on as to hand you half a million or so and get a promise in return. I want your plans, and I want \u0027em in full.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A little exclamation broke from Sam Hupp. He checked it, but not before Berg\u0027s curiously penetrating pale blue eyes had glanced up at him, and away again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve told you, Mr. Griebler,\" went on Bartholomew Berg\u0027s patient voice, \"just why the thing you insist on is impossible. This firm does not submit advance copy. Every business commission that comes to us is given all the skill, and thought, and enthusiasm, and careful planning that this office is capable of. You know our record. This is a business of ideas. And ideas are too precious, too perishable, to spread in the market place for all to see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ben Griebler stood up. His cigar waggled furiously between his lips as he talked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know something else that don\u0027t stand spreading in the market place, Berg. And that\u0027s money. It\u0027s too darned perishable, too.\" He pointed a stubby finger at Jock. \"Does this fool rule of yours apply to this young fellow, too?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bartholomew Berg seemed to grow more patient, more self-contained as the other man\u0027s self-control slipped rapidly away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It goes for every man and woman in this office, Mr. Griebler. This young chap, McChesney here, might spend weeks and months building up a comprehensive advertising plan for you. He\u0027d spend those weeks studying your business from every possible angle. Perhaps it would be a plan that would require a year of waiting before the actual advertising began to appear. And then you might lose faith in the plan. A waiting game is a hard game to play. Some other man\u0027s idea, that promised quicker action, might appeal to you. And when it appeared we\u0027d very likely find our own original idea incorporated in—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, look here!\" squeaked Ben Griebler, his face dully red. \"D\u0027you mean to imply that I\u0027d steal your plan! D\u0027you mean to sit there and tell me to my face—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Griebler, I mean that that thing happens constantly in this business. We\u0027re almost powerless to stop it. Nothing spreads quicker than a new idea. Compared to it a woman\u0027s secret is a sealed book.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ben Griebler removed the cigar from his lips. He was stuttering with anger. With a mingling of despair and boldness Jock saw the advantage of that stuttering moment and seized on it. He stepped close to the broad table-desk, resting both hands on it and leaning forward slightly in his eagerness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Berg—I have a plan. Mr. Hupp can tell you. It came to me when I first heard that the Grieblers were going to broaden out. It\u0027s a real idea. I\u0027m sure of that. I\u0027ve worked it out in detail. Mr. Hupp himself said it—Why, I\u0027ve got the actual copy. And it\u0027s new. Absolutely. It never—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Trot it out!\" shouted Ben Griebler. \"I\u0027d like to see one idea anyway, around this shop.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"McChesney,\" said Bartholomew Berg, not raising his voice. His eyes rested on Jock with the steady, penetrating gaze that was peculiar to him. More foolhardy men than Jock McChesney had faltered and paused, abashed, under those eyes. \"McChesney, your enthusiasm for your work is causing you to forget one thing that must never be forgotten in this office.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock stepped back. His lower lip was caught between his teeth. At the same moment Ben Griebler snatched up his hat from the table, clapped it on his head at an absurd angle and, bristling like a fighting cock, confronted the three men. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a couple of rules myself,\" he cried, \"and don\u0027t you forget it. When you get a little spare time, you look up St. Louis and find out what state it\u0027s in. The slogan of that state is my slogan, you bet. If you think I\u0027m going to make you a present of the money that it took my old man fifty years to pile up, then you don\u0027t know that Griebler is a German name. Good day, gents.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He stalked to the door. There he turned dramatically and leveled a forefinger at Jock. \"They\u0027ve got you roped and tied. But I think you\u0027re a comer. If you change your mind, kid, come and see me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The door slammed behind him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whew!\" whistled Sam Hupp, passing a handkerchief over his bald spot. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bartholomew Berg reached out with one great capable hand and swept toward him a pile of papers. \"Oh, well, you can\u0027t blame him. Advertising has been a scream for so long. Griebler doesn\u0027t know the difference between advertising, publicity, and bunk. He\u0027ll learn. But it\u0027ll be an awfully expensive course. Now, Hupp, let\u0027s go over this Kalamazoo account. That\u0027ll be all, McChesney.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock turned without a word. He walked quickly through the outer office, into the great main room. There he stopped at the switchboard. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Er—Miss Grimes,\" he said, smiling charmingly. \"Where\u0027s this Mr. Griebler, of St. Louis, stopping; do you know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, where would he stop?\" retorted the wise Miss Grimes. \"Look at him! The Waldorf, of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thanks,\" said Jock, still smiling. And went back to his desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n At five Jock left the office. Under his arm he carried the flat pasteboard package secured by elastic bands. At five-fifteen he walked swiftly down the famous corridor of the great red stone hotel. The colorful glittering crowd that surged all about him he seemed not to see. He made straight for the main desk with its battalion of clerks. \\n\\n \u0027He made straight for the main desk with its battalion of clerks\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Griebler in? Mr. Ben Griebler, St. Louis?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The question set in motion the hotel\u0027s elaborate system of investigation. At last: \"Not in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know when he will be in?\" That futile question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t say. He left no word. Do you want to leave your name?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"N-no. Would he—does he stop at this desk when he comes in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was an unusually urbane hotel clerk. \"Why, usually they leave their keys and get their mail from the floor clerk. But Mr. Griebler seems to prefer the main desk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll—wait,\" said Jock. And seated in one of the great thronelike chairs, he waited. He sat there, slim and boyish, while the laughing, chattering crowd swept all about him. If you sit long enough in that foyer you will learn all there is to learn about life. An amazing sight it is—that crowd. Baraboo helps swell it, and Spokane, and Berlin, and Budapest, and Pekin, and Paris, and Waco, Texas. So varied it is, so cosmopolitan, that if you sit there patiently enough, and watch sharply enough you will even see a chance New Yorker. \\n\\n \\n\\n From door to desk Jock\u0027s eyes swept. The afternoon-tea crowd, in paradise feathers, and furs, and frock coats swam back and forth. He saw it give way to the dinner throng, satin-shod, bejeweled, hurrying through its oysters, swallowing unbelievable numbers of cloudy-amber drinks, and golden-brown drinks, and maroon drinks, then gathering up its furs and rushing theaterwards. He was still sitting there when that crowd, its eight o\u0027clock freshness somewhat sullied, its sparkle a trifle dimmed, swept back for more oysters, more cloudy-amber and golden-brown drinks. \\n\\n \\n\\n At half-hour intervals, then at hourly intervals, the figure in the great chair stirred, rose, and walked to the desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has Mr. Griebler come in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The supper throng, its laugh a little ribald, its talk a shade high-pitched, drifted towards the street, or was wafted up in elevators. The throng thinned to an occasional group. Then these became rarer and rarer. The revolving door admitted one man, or two, perhaps, who lingered not at all in the unaccustomed quiet of the great glittering lobby. \\n\\n \\n\\n The figure of the watcher took on a pathetic droop. The eyelids grew leaden. To open them meant an almost superhuman effort. The stare of the new night clerks grew more and more hostile and suspicious. A grayish pallor had settled down on the boy\u0027s face. And those lines of the night before stood out for all to see. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the stillness of the place the big revolving door turned once more, complainingly. For the thousandth time Jock\u0027s eyes lifted heavily. Then they flew wide open. The drooping figure straightened electrically. Half a dozen quick steps and Jock stood in the pathway of Ben Griebler who, rather ruffled and untidy, had blown in on the wings of the morning. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stared a moment. \"Well, what—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been waiting for you here since five o\u0027clock last evening. It will soon be five o\u0027clock again. Will you let me show you those plans now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ben Griebler had surveyed Jock with the stony calm of the out-of-town visitor who is prepared to show surprise at nothing in New York. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing like getting an early start,\" said Ben Griebler. \"Come on up to my room.\" Key in hand, he made for the elevator. For an almost imperceptible moment Jock paused. Then, with a little rush, he followed the short, thick-set figure. \"I knew you had it in you, McChesney. I said you looked like a comer, didn\u0027t I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock said nothing. He was silent while Griebler unlocked his door, turned on the light, fumbled at the windows and shades, picked up the telephone receiver. \"What\u0027ll you have?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing.\" Jock had cleared the center table and was opening his flat bundle of papers. He drew up two chairs. \"Let\u0027s not waste any time,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve had a twelve-hour wait for this.\" He seemed to control the situation. Obediently Ben Griebler hung up the receiver, came over, and took the chair very close to Jock. \\n\\n \u0027\u0027Let\u0027s not waste any time,\u0027 he said\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing artistic about gum,\" began Jock McChesney; and his manner was that of a man who is sure of himself. \"It\u0027s a shirt-sleeve product, and it ought to be handled from a shirt-sleeve standpoint. Every gum concern in the country has spent thousands on a \u0027better-than-candy\u0027 campaign before it realized that gum is a candy and drug store article, and that no man is going to push a five-cent package of gum at the sacrifice of the sale of an eighty-cent box of candy. But the health note is there, if only you strike it right. Now, here\u0027s my idea—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At six o\u0027clock Ben Griebler, his little shrewd eyes sparkling, his voice more squeakily falsetto than ever, surveyed the youngster before him with a certain awe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This—this thing will actually sell our stuff in Europe! No gum concern has ever been able to make the stuff go outside of this country. Why, inside of three years every \u0027Arry and \u0027Arriet in England\u0027ll be chewing it on bank holidays. I don\u0027t know about Germany, but—\" He pushed back his chair and got up. \"Well, I\u0027m solid on that. And what I say goes. Now I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do, kid. I\u0027ll take you down to St. Louis with me, at a figure that\u0027ll make your—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock looked up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Or if you don\u0027t want the Berg, Shriner crowd to get wise, I\u0027ll fix it this way. I\u0027ll go over there this morning and tell \u0027em I\u0027ve changed my mind, see? The campaign\u0027s theirs, see? Then I refuse to consider any of their suggestions until I see your plan. And when I see it I fall for it like a ton of bricks. Old Berg\u0027ll never know. He\u0027s so darned high-principled—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock McChesney stood up. The little drawn pinched look which had made his face so queerly old was gone. His eyes were bright. His face was flushed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There! You\u0027ve said it. I didn\u0027t realize how raw this deal was until you put it into words for me. I want to thank you. You\u0027re right. Bartholomew Berg is so darned high-principled that two muckers like you and me, groveling around in the dirt, can\u0027t even see the tips of the heights to which his ideals have soared. Don\u0027t stop me. I know I\u0027m talking like a book. But I feel like something that has just been kicked out into the sunshine after having been in jail.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re tired,\" said Ben Griebler. \"It\u0027s been a strain. Something always snaps after a long tension.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jock\u0027s flat palm came down among the papers with a crack. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You bet something snaps! It has just snapped inside me.\" He began quietly to gather up the papers in an orderly little way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that for?\" inquired Griebler, coming forward. \"You don\u0027t mean—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean that I\u0027m going to go home and square this thing with a lady you\u0027ve never met. You and she wouldn\u0027t get on if you did. You don\u0027t talk the same language. Then I\u0027m going to have a cold bath, and a hot breakfast. And then, Griebler, I\u0027m going to take this stuff to Bartholomew Berg and tell him the whole nasty business. He\u0027ll see the humor of it. But I don\u0027t know whether he\u0027ll fire me, or make me vice-president of the company. Now, if you want to come over and talk to him, fair and square, why come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ten to one he fires you,\" remarked Griebler, as Jock reached the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s only one person I know who\u0027s game enough to take you up on that. And it\u0027s going to take more nerve to face her at six-thirty than it will to tackle a whole battalion of Bartholomew Bergs at nine.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I guess I can get in a three-hour sleep before—er—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Before what?\" said Jock McChesney from the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ben Griebler laughed a little shamefaced laugh. \"Before I see you at ten, sonny.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2693/74066.html","bookId":1475,"book":{"id":1475,"title":"Personality Plus","description":"简介： When men began to build cities vertically instead of horizontally there passed from our highways a picturesque figure, and from our language an expressive figure of speech.
