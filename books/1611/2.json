He said mildly, \"A somewhat unhappy jingle, Rose, referring as it does to the end of the customer as consumer. Moreover, we shouldn\u0027t overplay the figurative \u0027rises through the air\u0027 angle. What inspired you?\"\\n\\n She shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know-oh, yes, I do. I was remembering one of the workers\u0027 songs we machines used to chant during the Big Strike-\\n\\n \"Work and pray, Live on hay. You\u0027ll get pie In the sky When you die- It\u0027s a lie!\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why we chanted it,\" she added. \"We didn\u0027t want pie-or hay, for that matter. And machines don\u0027t pray, except Tibetan prayer wheels.\"\\n\\n Phineas T. Gryce shook his head. \"Labor relations are another topic we should stay far away from. However, dear Rose, I\u0027m glad you keep trying to outjingle those dirty crooks at Fairy Bread.\" He scowled, turning back his attention to Tin Philosopher. \"I get whopping mad, Old Machine, whenever I hear that other slogan of theirs, the discriminatory one-\u0027Untouched by Robot Claws.\u0027 Just because they employ a few filthy androids in their factories!\"\\n\\n Tin Philosopher lifted one of his own sets of bright talons. \"Thanks, P.T. But to continue my historical resume, the next great advance in the baking art was the substitution of purified carbon dioxide, recovered from coal smoke, for the gas generated by yeast organisms indwelling in the dough and later killed by the heat of baking, their corpses remaining in situ. But even purified carbon dioxide is itself a rather repugnant gas, a product of metabolism whether fast or slow, and forever associated with those life processes which are obnoxious to the fastidious.\"\\n\\n Here the machine shuddered with delicate clinkings. \"Therefore, we of Puffyloaf are taking today what may be the ultimate step toward purity: we are aerating our loaves with the noble gas helium, an element which remains virginal in the face of all chemical temptations and whose slim molecules are eleven times lighter than obese carbon dioxide-yes, noble uncontaminable helium, which, if it be a kind of ash, is yet the ash only of radioactive burning, accomplished or initiated entirely on the Sun, a safe 93 million miles from this planet. Let\u0027s have a cheer for the helium loaf!\"\\n\\n Without changing expression, Phineas T. Gryce rapped the table thrice in solemn applause, while the others bowed their heads.\\n\\n \"Thanks, T.P.,\" P.T. then said. \"And now for the Moment of Truth. Miss Winterly, how is the helium loaf selling?\"\\n\\n The business girl clapped on a pair of earphones and whispered into a lapel mike. Her gaze grew abstracted as she mentally translated flurries of brief squawks into coherent messages. Suddenly a single vertical furrow creased her matchlessly smooth brow.\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t, Mr. Gryce!\" she gasped in horror. \"Fairy Bread is outselling Puffyloaves by an infinity factor. So far this morning, there has not been one single delivery of Puffyloaves to any sales spot! Complaints about non-delivery are pouring in from both walking stores and sessile shops.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Snedden!\" Gryce barked. \"What bug in the new helium process might account for this delay?\"\\n\\n Roger was on his feet, looking bewildered. \"I can\u0027t imagine, sir, unless-just possibly-there\u0027s been some unforeseeable difficulty involving the new metal-foil wrappers.\"\\n\\n \"Metal-foil wrappers? Were you responsible for those?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. Last-minute recalculations showed that the extra lightness of the new loaf might be great enough to cause drift during stackage. Drafts in stores might topple sales pyramids. Metal-foil wrappers, by their added weight, took care of the difficulty.\"\\n\\n \"And you ordered them without consulting the Board?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. There was hardly time and-\"\\n\\n \"Why, you fool! I noticed that order for metal-foil wrappers, assumed it was some sub-secretary\u0027s mistake, and canceled it last night!\"\\n\\n Roger Snedden turned pale. \"You canceled it?\" he quavered. \"And told them to go back to the lighter plastic wrappers?\"\\n\\n \"Of course! Just what is behind all this, Mr. Snedden? What recalculations were you trusting, when our physicists had demonstrated months ago that the helium loaf was safely stackable in light airs and gentle breezes-winds up to Beaufort\u0027s scale 3. Why should a change from heavier to lighter wrappers result in complete non-delivery?\"\\n\\n Roger Snedden\u0027s paleness became tinged with an interesting green. He cleared his throat and made strange gulping noises. Tin Philosopher\u0027s photocells focused on him calmly, Rose Thinker\u0027s with unfeigned excitement. P.T. Gryce\u0027s frown grew blacker by the moment, while Megera Winterly\u0027s Venus-mask showed an odd dawning of dismay and awe. She was getting new squawks in her earphones.\\n\\n \"Er... ah... er....\" Roger said in winning tones. \"Well, you see, the fact is that I....\"\\n\\n \"Hold it,\" Meg interrupted crisply. \"Triple-urgent from Public Relations, Safety Division. Tulsa-Topeka aero-express makes emergency landing after being buffeted in encounter with vast flight of objects first described as brown birds, although no failures reported in airway\u0027s electronic anti-bird fences. After grounding safely near Emporia-no fatalities-pilot\u0027s windshield found thinly plastered with soft white-and-brown material. Emblems on plastic wrappers embedded in material identify it incontrovertibly as an undetermined number of Puffyloaves cruising at three thousand feet!\"\\n\\n Eyes and photocells turned inquisitorially upon Roger Snedden. He went from green to Puffyloaf white and blurted: \"All right, I did it, but it was the only way out! Yesterday morning, due to the Ukrainian crisis, the government stopped sales and deliveries of all strategic stockpiled materials, including helium gas. Puffy\u0027s new program of advertising and promotion, based on the lighter loaf, was already rolling. There was only one thing to do, there being only one other gas comparable in lightness to helium. I diverted the necessary quantity of hydrogen gas from the Hydrogenated Oils Section of our Magna-Margarine Division and substituted it for the helium.\"\\n\\n \"You substituted... hydrogen... for the... helium?\" Phineas T. Gryce faltered in low mechanical tones, taking four steps backward.\\n\\n \"Hydrogen is twice as light as helium,\" Tin Philosopher remarked judiciously.\\n\\n \"And many times cheaper-did you know that?\" Roger countered feebly. \"Yes, I substituted hydrogen. The metal-foil wrapping would have added just enough weight to counteract the greater buoyancy of the hydrogen loaf. But-\"\\n\\n \"So, when this morning\u0027s loaves began to arrive on the delivery platforms of the walking mills....\" Tin Philosopher left the remark unfinished.\\n\\n \"Exactly,\" Roger agreed dismally.\\n\\n \"Let me ask you, Mr. Snedden,\" Gryce interjected, still in low tones, \"if you expected people to jump to the kitchen ceiling for their Puffybread after taking off the metal wrapper, or reach for the sky if they happened to unwrap the stuff outdoors?\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Gryce,\" Roger said reproachfully, \"you have often assured me that what people do with Puffybread after they buy it is no concern of ours.\"\\n\\n \"I seem to recall,\" Rose Thinker chirped somewhat unkindly, \"that dictum was created to answer inquiries after Roger put the famous sculptures-in-miniature artist on 3D and he testified that he always molded his first attempts from Puffybread, one jumbo loaf squeezing down to approximately the size of a peanut.\"\\n\\n Her photocells dimmed and brightened. \"Oh, boy-hydrogen! The loaf\u0027s unwrapped. After a while, in spite of the crust-seal, a little oxygen diffuses in. An explosive mixture. Housewife in curlers and kimono pops a couple slices in the toaster. Boom!\"\\n\\n The three human beings in the room winced.\\n\\n Tin Philosopher kicked her under the table, while observing, \"So you see, Roger, that the non-delivery of the hydrogen loaf carries some consolations. And I must confess that one aspect of the affair gives me great satisfaction, not as a Board Member but as a private machine. You have at last made a reality of the \u0027rises through the air\u0027 part of Puffybread\u0027s theme. They can\u0027t ever take that away from you. By now, half the inhabitants of the Great Plains must have observed our flying loaves rising high.\"\\n\\n Phineas T. Gryce shot a frightened look at the west windows and found his full voice.\\n\\n \"Stop the mills!\" he roared at Meg Winterly, who nodded and whispered urgently into her mike.\\n\\n \"A sensible suggestion,\" Tin Philosopher said. \"But it comes a trifle late in the day. If the mills are still walking and grinding, approximately seven billion Puffyloaves are at this moment cruising eastward over Middle America. Remember that a six-month supply for deep-freeze is involved and that the current consumption of bread, due to its matchless airiness, is eight and one-half loaves per person per day.\"\\n\\n Phineas T. Gryce carefully inserted both hands into his scanty hair, feeling for a good grip. He leaned menacingly toward Roger who, chin resting on the table, regarded him apathetically.\\n\\n \"Hold it!\" Meg called sharply. \"Flock of multiple-urgents coming in. News Liaison: information bureaus swamped with flying-bread inquiries. Aero-expresslines: Clear our airways or face law suit. U. S. Army: Why do loaves flame when hit by incendiary bullets? U. S. Customs: If bread intended for export, get export license or face prosecution. Russian Consulate in Chicago: Advise on destination of bread-lift. And some Kansas church is accusing us of a hoax inciting to blasphemy, of faking miracles-I don\u0027t know why.\"\\n\\n The business girl tore off her headphones. \"Roger Snedden,\" she cried with a hysteria that would have dumfounded her underlings, \"you\u0027ve brought the name of Puffyloaf in front of the whole world, all right! Now do something about the situation!\"\\n\\n Roger nodded obediently. But his pallor increased a shade, the pupils of his eyes disappeared under the upper lids, and his head burrowed beneath his forearms.\\n\\n \"Oh, boy,\" Rose Thinker called gayly to Tin Philosopher, \"this looks like the start of a real crisis session! Did you remember to bring spare batteries?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bread-overhead/page-2.html","bookId":1611,"book":{"id":1611,"title":"Bread Overhead","description":"Storyline: \"Bread Overhead\" is a story Fritz Leiber could have written to send up today\u0027s bewildering bread aisle -- all those claims of low-cal and low-low-carb. In fact, the story probably reads better now than it did in 1958, back when the choice came down to white or whole wheat. Leiber slyly imagines a near-future when giant machines not only harvest the wheat field, but grind flour and bake bread on the spot -- the ultimate in big farming. In this toasted tomorrow, the highly-mechanized Puffy Products is bent on producing the supremely lightest loaf. The story is what happens if bread isn\u0027t just airy, but pumped full of lighter-than-air helium. Leiber (\"Ships to the Stars\") didn\u0027t often bake up such a souffle of spoof, but he\u0027s a master in the kitchen.
