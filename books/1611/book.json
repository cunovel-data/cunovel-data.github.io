{"id":1611,"title":"Bread Overhead","description":"Storyline: \"Bread Overhead\" is a story Fritz Leiber could have written to send up today\u0027s bewildering bread aisle -- all those claims of low-cal and low-low-carb. In fact, the story probably reads better now than it did in 1958, back when the choice came down to white or whole wheat. Leiber slyly imagines a near-future when giant machines not only harvest the wheat field, but grind flour and bake bread on the spot -- the ultimate in big farming. In this toasted tomorrow, the highly-mechanized Puffy Products is bent on producing the supremely lightest loaf. The story is what happens if bread isn\u0027t just airy, but pumped full of lighter-than-air helium. Leiber (\"Ships to the Stars\") didn\u0027t often bake up such a souffle of spoof, but he\u0027s a master in the kitchen. And \"Bread Overhead\" has just enough to say about human nature to be filling, besides.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/bread-overhead.jpg","author":"Fritz Leiber","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":3,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
