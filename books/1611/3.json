Aero-expresslines organized sightseeing flights along the flanks. Planes of the government forestry and agricultural services and \u0027copters bearing the Puffyloaf emblem hovered on the fringes, watching developments and waiting for orders. A squadron of supersonic fighters hung menacingly above.\\n\\n The behavior of birds varied considerably. Most fled or gave the loaves a wide berth, but some bolder species, discovering the minimal nutritive nature of the translucent brown objects, attacked them furiously with beaks and claws. Hydrogen diffusing slowly through the crusts had now distended most of the sealed plastic wrappers into little balloons, which ruptured, when pierced, with disconcerting pops.\\n\\n Below, neck-craning citizens crowded streets and back yards, cranks and cultists had a field day, while local and national governments raged indiscriminately at Puffyloaf and at each other.\\n\\n Rumors that a fusion weapon would be exploded in the midst of the flying bread drew angry protests from conservationists and a flood of telefax pamphlets titled \"H-Loaf or H-bomb?\"\\n\\n Stockholm sent a mystifying note of praise to the United Nations Food Organization.\\n\\n Delhi issued nervous denials of a millet blight that no one had heard of until that moment and reaffirmed India\u0027s ability to feed her population with no outside help except the usual.\\n\\n Radio Moscow asserted that the Kremlin would brook no interference in its treatment of the Ukrainians, jokingly referred to the flying bread as a farce perpetrated by mad internationalists inhabiting Cloud Cuckoo Land, added contradictory references to airborne bread booby-trapped by Capitalist gangsters, and then fell moodily silent on the whole topic.\\n\\n Radio Venus reported to its winged audience that Earth\u0027s inhabitants were establishing food depots in the upper air, preparatory to taking up permanent aerial residence \"such as we have always enjoyed on Venus.\"\\n\\n NewNew York made feverish preparations for the passage of the flying bread. Tickets for sightseeing space in skyscrapers were sold at high prices; cold meats and potted spreads were hawked to viewers with the assurance that they would be able to snag the bread out of the air and enjoy a historic sandwich.\\n\\n Phineas T. Gryce, escaping from his own managerial suite, raged about the city, demanding general cooperation in the stretching of great nets between the skyscrapers to trap the errant loaves. He was captured by Tin Philosopher, escaped again, and was found posted with oxygen mask and submachine gun on the topmost spire of Puffyloaf Tower, apparently determined to shoot down the loaves as they appeared and before they involved his company in more trouble with Customs and the State Department.\\n\\n Recaptured by Tin Philosopher, who suffered only minor bullet holes, he was given a series of mild electroshocks and returned to the conference table, calm and clear-headed as ever.\\n\\n But the bread flight, swinging away from a hurricane moving up the Atlantic coast, crossed a clouded-in Boston by night and disappeared into a high Atlantic overcast, also thereby evading a local storm generated by the Weather Department in a last-minute effort to bring down or at least disperse the H-loaves.\\n\\n Warnings and counterwarnings by Communist and Capitalist governments seriously interfered with military trailing of the flight during this period and it was actually lost in touch with for several days.\\n\\n At scattered points, seagulls were observed fighting over individual loaves floating down from the gray roof-that was all.\\n\\n A mood of spirituality strongly tinged with humor seized the people of the world. Ministers sermonized about the bread, variously interpreting it as a call to charity, a warning against gluttony, a parable of the evanescence of all earthly things, and a divine joke. Husbands and wives, facing each other across their walls of breakfast toast, burst into laughter. The mere sight of a loaf of bread anywhere was enough to evoke guffaws. An obscure sect, having as part of its creed the injunction \"Don\u0027t take yourself so damn seriously,\" won new adherents.\\n\\n The bread flight, rising above an Atlantic storm widely reported to have destroyed it, passed unobserved across a foggy England and rose out of the overcast only over Mittel-europa. The loaves had at last reached their maximum altitude.\\n\\n The Sun\u0027s rays beat through the rarified air on the distended plastic wrappers, increasing still further the pressure of the confined hydrogen. They burst by the millions and tens of millions. A high-flying Bulgarian evangelist, who had happened to mistake the up-lever for the east-lever in the cockpit of his flier and who was the sole witness of the event, afterward described it as \"the foaming of a sea of diamonds, the crackle of God\u0027s knuckles.\"\\n\\n By the millions and tens of millions, the loaves coasted down into the starving Ukraine. Shaken by a week of humor that threatened to invade even its own grim precincts, the Kremlin made a sudden about-face. A new policy was instituted of communal ownership of the produce of communal farms, and teams of hunger-fighters and caravans of trucks loaded with pumpernickel were dispatched into the Ukraine.\\n\\n World distribution was given to a series of photographs showing peasants queueing up to trade scavenged Puffyloaves for traditional black bread, recently aerated itself but still extra solid by comparison, the rate of exchange demanded by the Moscow teams being twenty Puffyloaves to one of pumpernickel.\\n\\n Another series of photographs, picturing chubby workers\u0027 children being blown to bits by booby-trapped bread, was quietly destroyed.\\n\\n Congratulatory notes were exchanged by various national governments and world organizations, including the Brotherhood of Free Business Machines. The great bread flight was over, though for several weeks afterward scattered falls of loaves occurred, giving rise to a new folklore of manna among lonely Arabian tribesmen, and in one well-authenticated instance in Tibet, sustaining life in a party of mountaineers cut off by a snow slide.\\n\\n Back in NewNew York, the managerial board of Puffy Products slumped in utter collapse around the conference table, the long crisis session at last ended. Empty coffee cartons were scattered around the chairs of the three humans, dead batteries around those of the two machines. For a while, there was no movement whatsoever. Then Roger Snedden reached out wearily for the earphones where Megera Winterly had hurled them down, adjusted them to his head, pushed a button and listened apathetically.\\n\\n After a bit, his gaze brightened. He pushed more buttons and listened more eagerly. Soon he was sitting tensely upright on his stool, eyes bright and lower face all a-smile, muttering terse comments and questions into the lapel mike torn from Meg\u0027s fair neck.\\n\\n The others, reviving, watched him, at first dully, then with quickening interest, especially when he jerked off the earphones with a happy shout and sprang to his feet.\\n\\n \"Listen to this!\" he cried in a ringing voice. \"As a result of the worldwide publicity, Puffyloaves are outselling Fairy Bread three to one-and that\u0027s just the old carbon-dioxide stock from our freezers! It\u0027s almost exhausted, but the government, now that the Ukrainian crisis is over, has taken the ban off helium and will also sell us stockpiled wheat if we need it. We can have our walking mills burrowing into the wheat caves in a matter of hours!\\n\\n \"But that isn\u0027t all! The far greater demand everywhere is for Puffyloaves that will actually float. Public Relations, Child Liaison Division, reports that the kiddies are making their mothers\u0027 lives miserable about it. If only we can figure out some way to make hydrogen non-explosive or the helium loaf float just a little-\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure we can take care of that quite handily,\" Tin Philosopher interrupted briskly. \"Puffyloaf has kept it a corporation secret-even you\u0027ve never been told about it-but just before he went crazy, Everett Whitehead discovered a way to make bread using only half as much flour as we do in the present loaf. Using this secret technique, which we\u0027ve been saving for just such an emergency, it will be possible to bake a helium loaf as buoyant in every respect as the hydrogen loaf.\"\\n\\n \"Good!\" Roger cried. \"We\u0027ll tether \u0027em on strings and sell \u0027em like balloons. No mother-child shopping team will leave the store without a cluster. Buying bread balloons will be the big event of the day for kiddies. It\u0027ll make the carry-home shopping load lighter too! I\u0027ll issue orders at once-\"\\n\\n He broke off, looking at Phineas T. Gryce, said with quiet assurance, \"Excuse me, sir, if I seem to be taking too much upon myself.\"\\n\\n \"Not at all, son; go straight ahead,\" the great manager said approvingly. \"You\u0027re\"-he laughed in anticipation of getting off a memorable remark-\"rising to the challenging situation like a genuine Puffyloaf.\"\\n\\n Megera Winterly looked from the older man to the younger. Then in a single leap she was upon Roger, her arms wrapped tightly around him.\\n\\n \"My sweet little ever-victorious, self-propelled monkey wrench!\" she crooned in his ear. Roger looked fatuously over her soft shoulder at Tin Philosopher who, as if moved by some similar feeling, reached over and touched claws with Rose Thinker.\\n\\n This, however, was what he telegraphed silently to his fellow machine across the circuit so completed:\\n\\n \"Good-o, Rosie! That makes another victory for robot-engineered world unity, though you almost gave us away at the start with that \u0027bread overhead\u0027 jingle. We\u0027ve struck another blow against the next world war, in which-as we know only too well! - we machines would suffer the most. Now if we can only arrange, say, a fur-famine in Alaska and a migration of long-haired Siberian lemmings across Behring Straits... we\u0027d have to swing the Japanese Current up there so it\u0027d be warm enough for the little fellows.... Anyhow, Rosie, with a spot of help from the Brotherhood, those humans will paint themselves into the peace corner yet.\"\\n\\n Meanwhile, he and Rose Thinker quietly watched the Blonde Icicle melt. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bread-overhead/page-3.html","bookId":1611,"book":{"id":1611,"title":"Bread Overhead","description":"Storyline: \"Bread Overhead\" is a story Fritz Leiber could have written to send up today\u0027s bewildering bread aisle -- all those claims of low-cal and low-low-carb. In fact, the story probably reads better now than it did in 1958, back when the choice came down to white or whole wheat. Leiber slyly imagines a near-future when giant machines not only harvest the wheat field, but grind flour and bake bread on the spot -- the ultimate in big farming. In this toasted tomorrow, the highly-mechanized Puffy Products is bent on producing the supremely lightest loaf. The story is what happens if bread isn\u0027t just airy, but pumped full of lighter-than-air helium. Leiber (\"Ships to the Stars\") didn\u0027t often bake up such a souffle of spoof, but he\u0027s a master in the kitchen.
