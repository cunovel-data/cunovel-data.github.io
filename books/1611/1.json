{"id":93212,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"As a blisteringly hot but guaranteed weather-controlled future summer day dawned on the Mississippi Valley, the walking mills of Puffy Products (\"Spike to Loaf in One Operation!\") began to tread delicately on their centipede legs across the wheat fields of Kansas.\n The walking mills resembled fat metal serpents, rather larger than those Chinese paper dragons animated by files of men in procession. Sensory robot devices in their noses informed them that the waiting wheat had reached ripe perfection.\n As they advanced, their heads swung lazily from side to side, very much like snakes, gobbling the yellow grain. In their throats, it was threshed, the chaff bundled and burped aside for pickup by the crawl trucks of a chemical corporation, the kernels quick-dried and blown along into the mighty chests of the machines. There the tireless mills ground the kernels to flour, which was instantly sifted, the bran being packaged and dropped like the chaff for pickup. A cluster of tanks which gave the metal serpents a decidedly humpbacked appearance added water, shortening, salt and other ingredients, some named and some not. The dough was at the same time infused with gas from a tank conspicuously labeled \"Carbon Dioxide\" (\"No Yeast Creatures in Your Bread!\").\n Thus instantly risen, the dough was clipped into loaves and shot into radionic ovens forming the midsections of the metal serpents. There the bread was baked in a matter of seconds, a fierce heat-front browning the crusts, and the piping-hot loaves sealed in transparent plastic bearing the proud Puffyloaf emblem (two cherubs circling a floating loaf) and ejected onto the delivery platform at each serpent\u0027s rear end, where a cluster of pickup machines, like hungry piglets, snatched at the loaves with hygienic claws.\n A few loaves would be hurried off for the day\u0027s consumption, the majority stored for winter in strategically located mammoth deep freezes.\n But now, behold a wonder! As loaves began to appear on the delivery platform of the first walking mill to get into action, they did not linger on the conveyor belt, but rose gently into the air and slowly traveled off down-wind across the hot rippling fields.\n The robot claws of the pickup machines clutched in vain, and, not noticing the difference, proceeded carefully to stack emptiness, tier by tier. One errant loaf, rising more sluggishly than its fellows, was snagged by a thrusting claw. The machine paused, clumsily wiped off the injured loaf, set it aside-where it bobbed on one corner, unable to take off again-and went back to the work of storing nothingness.\n A flock of crows rose from the trees of a nearby shelterbelt as the flight of loaves approached. The crows swooped to investigate and then suddenly scattered, screeching in panic.\n The helicopter of a hangoverish Sunday traveler bound for Wichita shied very similarly from the brown fliers and did not return for a second look.\n A black-haired housewife spied them over her back fence, crossed herself and grabbed her walkie-talkie from the laundry basket. Seconds later, the yawning correspondent of a regional newspaper was jotting down the lead of a humorous news story which, recalling the old flying-saucer scares, stated that now apparently bread was to be included in the mad aerial tea party.\n The congregation of an open-walled country church, standing up to recite the most familiar of Christian prayers, had just reached the petition for daily sustenance, when a sub-flight of the loaves, either forced down by a vagrant wind or lacking the natural buoyancy of the rest, came coasting silently as the sunbeams between the graceful pillars at the altar end of the building.\n Meanwhile, the main flight, now augmented by other bread flocks from scores and hundreds of walking mills that had started work a little later, mounted slowly and majestically into the cirrus-flecked upper air, where a steady wind was blowing strongly toward the east.\n About one thousand miles farther on in that direction, where a cluster of stratosphere-tickling towers marked the location of the metropolis of NewNew York, a tender scene was being enacted in the pressurized penthouse managerial suite of Puffy Products. Megera Winterly, Secretary in Chief to the Managerial Board and referred to by her underlings as the Blonde Icicle, was dealing with the advances of Roger (\"Racehorse\") Snedden, Assistant Secretary to the Board and often indistinguishable from any passing office boy.\n \"Why don\u0027t you jump out the window, Roger, remembering to shut the airlock after you?\" the Golden Glacier said in tones not unkind. \"When are your high-strung, thoroughbred nerves going to accept the fact that I would never consider marriage with a business inferior? You have about as much chance as a starving Ukrainian kulak now that Moscow\u0027s clapped on the interdict.\"\n Roger\u0027s voice was calm, although his eyes were feverishly bright, as he replied, \"A lot of things are going to be different around here, Meg, as soon as the Board is forced to admit that only my quick thinking made it possible to bring the name of Puffyloaf in front of the whole world.\"\n \"Puffyloaf could do with a little of that,\" the business girl observed judiciously. \"The way sales have been plummeting, it won\u0027t be long before the Government deeds our desks to the managers of Fairy Bread and asks us to take the Big Jump. But just where does your quick thinking come into this, Mr. Snedden? You can\u0027t be referring to the helium-that was Rose Thinker\u0027s brainwave.\"\n She studied him suspiciously. \"You\u0027ve birthed another promotional bumble, Roger. I can see it in your eyes. I only hope it\u0027s not as big a one as when you put the Martian ambassador on 3D and he thanked you profusely for the gross of Puffyloaves, assuring you that he\u0027d never slept on a softer mattress in all his life on two planets.\"\n \"Listen to me, Meg. Today-yes, today! - you\u0027re going to see the Board eating out of my hand.\"\n \"Hah! I guarantee you won\u0027t have any fingers left. You\u0027re bold enough now, but when Mr. Gryce and those two big machines come through that door-\"\n \"Now wait a minute, Meg-\"\n \"Hush! They\u0027re coming now!\"\n Roger leaped three feet in the air, but managed to land without a sound and edged toward his stool. Through the dilating iris of the door strode Phineas T. Gryce, flanked by Rose Thinker and Tin Philosopher.\n The man approached the conference table in the center of the room with measured pace and gravely expressionless face. The rose-tinted machine on his left did a couple of impulsive pirouettes on the way and twittered a greeting to Meg and Roger. The other machine quietly took the third of the high seats and lifted a claw at Meg, who now occupied a stool twice the height of Roger\u0027s.\n \"Miss Winterly, please-our theme.\"\n The Blonde Icicle\u0027s face thawed into a little-girl smile as she chanted bubblingly:\n \"Made up of tiny wheaten motes And reinforced with sturdy oats, It rises through the air and floats- The bread on which all Terra dotes!\"\n \"Thank you, Miss Winterly,\" said Tin Philosopher. \"Though a purely figurative statement, that bit about rising through the air always gets me-here.\" He rapped his midsection, which gave off a high musical clang.\n \"Ladies-\" he inclined his photocells toward Rose Thinker and Meg-\"and gentlemen. This is a historic occasion in Old Puffy\u0027s long history, the inauguration of the helium-filled loaf (\u0027So Light It Almost Floats Away!\u0027) in which that inert and heaven-aspiring gas replaces old-fashioned carbon dioxide. Later, there will be kudos for Rose Thinker, whose bright relays genius-sparked the idea, and also for Roger Snedden, who took care of the details.\n \"By the by, Racehorse, that was a brilliant piece of work getting the helium out of the government-they\u0027ve been pretty stuffy lately about their monopoly. But first I want to throw wide the casement in your minds that opens on the Long View of Things.\"\n Rose Thinker spun twice on her chair and opened her photocells wide. Tin Philosopher coughed to limber up the diaphragm of his speaker and continued:\n \"Ever since the first cave wife boasted to her next-den neighbor about the superior paleness and fluffiness of her tortillas, mankind has sought lighter, whiter bread. Indeed, thinkers wiser than myself have equated the whole upward course of culture with this poignant quest. Yeast was a wonderful discovery-for its primitive day. Sifting the bran and wheat germ from the flour was an even more important advance. Early bleaching and preserving chemicals played their humble parts.\n \"For a while, barbarous faddists-blind to the deeply spiritual nature of bread, which is recognized by all great religions-held back our march toward perfection with their hair-splitting insistence on the vitamin content of the wheat germ, but their case collapsed when tasteless colorless substitutes were triumphantly synthesized and introduced into the loaf, which for flawless purity, unequaled airiness and sheer intangible goodness was rapidly becoming mankind\u0027s supreme gustatory experience.\"\n \"I wonder what the stuff tastes like,\" Rose Thinker said out of a clear sky.\n \"I wonder what taste tastes like,\" Tin Philosopher echoed dreamily. Recovering himself, he continued:\n \"Then, early in the twenty-first century, came the epochal researches of Everett Whitehead, Puffyloaf chemist, culminating in his paper \u0027The Structural Bubble in Cereal Masses\u0027 and making possible the baking of airtight bread twenty times stronger (for its weight) than steel and of a lightness that would have been incredible even to the advanced chemist-bakers of the twentieth century-a lightness so great that, besides forming the backbone of our own promotion, it has forever since been capitalized on by our conscienceless competitors of Fairy Bread with their enduring slogan: \u0027It Makes Ghost Toast\u0027.\"\n \"That\u0027s a beaut, all right, that ecto-dough blurb,\" Rose Thinker admitted, bugging her photocells sadly. \"Wait a sec. How about?-\n \"There\u0027ll be bread Overhead When you\u0027re dead- It is said.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bread-overhead/page-1.html","bookId":1611,"book":{"id":1611,"title":"Bread Overhead","description":"Storyline: \n \"Bread Overhead\" is a story Fritz Leiber could have written to send up today\u0027s bewildering bread aisle -- all those claims of low-cal and low-low-carb. In fact, the story probably reads better now than it did in 1958, back when the choice came down to white or whole wheat. Leiber slyly imagines a near-future when giant machines not only harvest the wheat field, but grind flour and bake bread on the spot -- the ultimate in big farming. In this toasted tomorrow, the highly-mechanized Puffy Products is bent on producing the supremely lightest loaf. The story is what happens if bread isn\u0027t just airy, but pumped full of lighter-than-air helium. Leiber (\"Ships to the Stars\") didn\u0027t often bake up such a souffle of spoof, but he\u0027s a master in the kitchen. And \"Bread Overhead\" has just enough to say about human nature to be filling, besides.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/bread-overhead.jpg","author":"Fritz Leiber","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/bread-overhead.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:30 PM"}}
