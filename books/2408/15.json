Nordmann frowned. `Maybe they went on the blink.\u0027 `Why?\u0027 Graves asked. `Maybe when we cut the power to the apartment -\u0027 `But they worked before.\u0027 `Yes, that\u0027s true. They did.\u0027 `Why should they break down now?\u0027 At that moment a cop came up the stairs, panting heavily. `Damned elevators are broken down,\u0027 he said. `We checked the circuit breakers in the basement., There was a timer wired in to knock out the elevators exactly at five.\u0027 `At five?\u0027 Graves asked. He looked at Nordmann. Nordmann shrugged. `Probably just a little irritant he threw in.\u0027 `An irritant? But that doesn\u0027t make sense.\u0027 `It\u0027s plenty irritating to me,\u0027 Nordmann said. `I don\u0027t want to walk down nineteen flights of stairs.\u0027 `Of course,\u0027 Graves said. `But why do it now?\u0027 `I don\u0027t get you.\u0027 `Well, if Wright wanted to make things difficult, he would have knocked out the elevators at four PM. And that would have made things very difficult for us. It might even have delayed us until the gas went off.\u0027 `True.\u0027 `But why wait until five? By then we\u0027ve either beaten his system or we haven\u0027t.\u0027 `Listen,\u0027 Nordmann said, `I think you\u0027re tired. You\u0027ve been worrying about Wright for so long -\u0027 `I am not tired,\u0027 Graves said, shaking off Nordmann\u0027s arm. \u0027Wright was a logical man, and there is logic in this move.\u0027 `There are no more moves,\u0027 Nordmann said. `We\u0027ve won.\u0027 `Yes,\u0027 Graves said. `That\u0027s exactly what we\u0027re supposed to think.\u0027 And he turned and walked back to the apartment. `John,\u0027 Nordmann said, running to catch up with him. `John, listen -\u0027 `You listen,\u0027 Graves said. `What\u0027s the point of knocking out the elevators after five?\u0027 `It has no point. It\u0027s a foolish irritation.\u0027 `Wrong,\u0027 Graves said. `It has one important point. It traps everybody on the nineteenth floor. And it traps the tanks as well.\u0027 `That\u0027s true,\u0027 Nordmann said. `But it hardly matters. We\u0027ve disarmed the mechanism.\u0027 `Have we?\u0027 `Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake, of course we have. You did it yourself. You know it\u0027s disarmed.\u0027 `But what if it\u0027s not?\u0027 `How can it not be?\u0027 At that, Graves sighed. `I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he admitted. He reentered the apartment. HE OFTEN FEELS THAT A PROBLEM IS SOLVED WHEN IT IS ONLY HALF FINISHED, OR TWO-THIRDS FINISHED. Graves remembered the psychological report as he paced the apartment, talking out loud. Nordmann watched him and listened. In the background, cops were disassembling the tank mechanisms. `All right,\u0027 Graves said. `Let\u0027s think it through. Wright designed a mechanism.\u0027 `Yes.\u0027 `And the mechanism had a purpose.\u0027 `Yes, to dump nerve gas over the city at five rht.\u0027 Graves nodded. `And we have thwarted that.\u0027 `Yes,\u0027 Nordmann said. `Did he have any other purpose?\u0027 `Well, I don\u0027t know. You could answer that better than anyone. Somebody mentioned something about disagreeing with the President over China -\u0027 `No, no,\u0027 Graves said. `Let\u0027s forget about motivation. Let\u0027s consider only the intent of his system. Did he intend to do anything besides dump the nerve gas?\u0027 `Raise hell, create panic...\u0027 Nordmann shrugged. Graves was silent, frowning at the room. `I mean,\u0027 he said, `did Wright intend his elaborate mechanism to do anything besides dump the gas?\u0027 `No,\u0027 Nordmann said. `I agree,\u0027 Graves said. There was a long pause. Graves considered everything. he knew, from every angle. He could make no sense of it, but he somehow felt certain that pieces were missing. Vital pieces... `He knew about you,\u0027 Graves said suddenly. `What?\u0027 `He knew about you. He knew that I had called you in.\u0027 `So what?\u0027 `Why should he care?\u0027 `He didn\u0027t care.\u0027 Graves began to see. It was coming into focus. `Because,\u0027 he said, \u0027Wright knew about you. He knew your position, and he knew your expertise. He must have known that you could provide an antidote to the binary gas. `If he knew you could provide an antidote, then he also knew his protection - filling this room with gas -would not work. We\u0027d break in. He knew that.\u0027 `Are you sure?\u0027 `Yes, I\u0027m sure. And he didn\u0027t care.\u0027 `Perhaps he was bluffing,\u0027 Nordmann said. `It\u0027s too important for a blur. He must have had another part of his system to cover that eventuality. He must have planned it so that if we did break in, he\u0027d still manage to win.\u0027 Nordmann considered it all very carefully. At length he sighed and shook his head. `I\u0027m sorry, John,\u0027 he said, `I think you\u0027re entirely wrong about this. You\u0027re making hypothetical sand castles in the air -\u0027 `No!\u0027 Graves snapped his fingers. `No, I\u0027m not. Because there was a second purpose to his system.\u0027 `What second purpose?\u0027 \u0027Wright was going. to Jamaica, or somewhere, correct?\u0027 `Correct.\u0027 `And he was not suicidal, correct?\u0027 `Correct. He expected to get there.\u0027 `All right. Then that establishes the need for a second purpose. His mechanism had to do two things.\u0027 `What two things?\u0027 `Look,\u0027 Graves said. He spoke as rapidly as he could, but he was hardly able to keep pace with his racing mind. \u0027Wright planned all this and planned it carefully. If he succeeded, a million people would die, including the President. A major political party would be wiped out. There would be national panic of incredible proportions. And for some reason, he wanted that.\u0027 `He was insane, yes...\u0027 `But not suicidal. He planned an escape. And the question is, what about afterwards?\u0027 \u0027Afterwards?\u0027 `Sure. Wright is on some beach sunning himself and gloating as he reads the headlines. But for how long?\u0027 `Damn,\u0027 Nordmann said, nodding. Phelps was also listening. `I don\u0027t follow you,\u0027 he said. `You never do,\u0027 Graves snapped. `But the point is this. Sooner or later, Navy men in protective suits would enter San Diego. They would determine that people died of nerve gas. They would search for the source. They would find this apartment. They would enter it. They would find the tanks. They would put the pieces together.\u0027 `And they would come after Wright,\u0027 Nordmann said. `Exactly,\u0027 Graves said. `Wherever he went, he wouldn\u0027t be safe. He would be a mass murderer and he would have left a very clear trail behind him.\u0027 He gestured at all the equipment. `Would he really leave such a clear trail for others to follow?\u0027 `It must be true,\u0027 Nordmann said, getting excited. `He had to have two purposes - first to discharge the gas, and second to obliterate the evidence.\u0027 `Obliterate the evidence how?\u0027 Phelps asked. Graves leaned on a tank. He turned to Nordmann. `How long would it take this cylinder of gas to discharge?\u0027 Nordmann shrugged. `Ten or fifteen minutes.\u0027 Then he said, `I see. You want to know exactly.\u0027 `Yes,\u0027 Graves said. `Why exactly?\u0027 Phelps asked. Graves ignored him. Nordmann said, `Normal Army pressure tanks are usually stabilized at five hundred pounds per square inch. So these tanks... Anybody got a tape measure?\u0027 He looked around the room. One of the cops had a tape. Nordmann measured the tank. `Thirty-seven inches in circumference,\u0027 he said. `Eight feet long, that\u0027s ninety-six inches, with a radius of...\u0027 He wrote on a small pad, doing rapid calculations. Phelps said to Graves, `Why do you need it exactly?\u0027 `Because,\u0027 Graves said, \u0027Wright didn\u0027t care if we broke into this room. He had another contingency plan to cover that. And we need to know when it will take effect.\u0027 Phelps looked totally confused. `A radius of six inches,\u0027 Nordmann was saying. `And a length of ninety-six inches gives a volume... well, figure for a cylinder... at five hundred psi... let me check the nozzles...\u0027 He wandered off. Graves said to a cop, `What time is it?\u0027 `Five oh seven, Mr Graves.\u0027 Nordmann finished his calculations and turned to Graves. `At normal discharge rates, it would take these tanks sixteen minutes to empty.\u0027 `That\u0027s it, then,\u0027 Graves said. `At five sixteen, a bomb will go off in this room, destroying everything. We\u0027ve got to find it.\u0027 Everyone paused. They stared at him. Phelps said, `A bomb?\u0027 `Of course. That\u0027s why he knocked out the elevators - to trap us here. In case we managed to disengage the mechanism, he wanted us here when the bomb went off, releasing the gas and eliminating the evidence.\u0027 Phelps said, `But there\u0027s no evidence of a bomb \u0027 `Remember the sniffer?\u0027 Nordmann asked. Phelps frowned. `The sniffer,\u0027 Graves said, `picked up oxides of nitrogen. Plastic explosive.\u0027 `Yes..., \u0027Okay,\u0027 Graves said. `Where is that explosive now?\u0027 Phelps looked around the room. `I don\u0027t see it anywhere,\u0027 he said. `But the sniffer detected it.\u0027 `Yes...\u0027 `There must be a bomb,\u0027 Graves said. `And it must be in plain sight.\u0027 `Five oh eight,\u0027 a cop said. `We better get these tanks out,\u0027 Nordmann said. `We don\u0027t want them damaged by the bomb.\u0027 `Right,\u0027 Graves said. `And let\u0027s get the sniffer in here. It\u0027ll help us find it.\u0027 The sniffer had been taken to the other building. Phelps turned on the walkie-talkie and talked to Lewis. Lewis said he would bring it as soon as he could, but it would take time to climb nineteen flights. Phelps told him to hurry and added a string of expletives. Meanwhile Nordmann supervised the removal of the tanks to the hallway. The cops carried them, four men to a cylinder, grunting under the weight. Graves searched the room - scanning the wall surfaces, the door, the window ledges for any irregularity, any discontinuity that would suggest the location of explosive. Plastic explosive, Compound C, could be shaped and moulded into a variety of forms. That was its advantage. It could be anywhere. Nordmann stuck his head into the room. `Maybe you should get out of here,\u0027 he said. `We can let the room blow if the tanks are far enough away. No sense in risking anything.\u0027 `I\u0027ll stay until we find it,\u0027 Graves said. He walked to the window and looked out. He saw Lewis running across the street with the sniffer on his shoulder. `Five ten,\u0027 Phelps said. It would take Lewis at least two minutes to scramble up all those stairs. Graves stared out the window, wondering what was happening to Wright. Had they managed to cut his body out of the wrecked car yet? Odd, he thought, how the game continues. \u0027Lewis is coming,\u0027 Phelps said. `I saw.\u0027 `How much explosive is supposed to be in this room?\u0027 `Twenty pounds.\u0027 `Christ.\u0027 Graves continued to stare out the window. Where would Wright hide twenty pounds of explosive? What would be the supremely logical hiding place? Nothing less would satisfy Wright, he was sure of that. He shifted his position at the window, careful to avoid the jagged splinters of glass around the sill. As he did so, he looked down at his shirt. There was printing on the shirt; some of the lettering from the tanks had come off on his arms and chest when he had leaned on them. \u0027 \" CHEMI,\" it said, and then faintly, \" DO NOT.\" He looked at his watch. 5:12. `Where the hell is Lewis?\u0027 Lewis appeared, running down the corridor redfaced and out of breath. `Sorry,\u0027 he said. `Came as fast as I could.\u0027 He turned on his sniffer and walked around the room, pointing the gunlike wand, staring at the dial on the shoulder unit. Graves and Nordmann watched him. Lewis began with the door, then turned to the walls. He checked carefully from baseboard to ceiling. In a slow, methodical way he went entirely around the room. Finally he stopped. 5:13. `You get a reading?\u0027 `No,\u0027 Lewis said, checking the machine. `Nothing.\u0027 `Maybe it\u0027s in another room,\u0027 Nordmann said. `I doubt it,\u0027 Graves said. `Let\u0027s check it,\u0027 Lewis said. He disappeared into the bathroom, worked through it and through the adjoining bedroom of the apartment. He came back a moment later. `Maybe the machine\u0027s broken.\u0027 `How can we test it?\u0027 `Give it a smell of some kind.\u0027 `Like what?\u0027 `Anything strong. Cologne, perfume, food...\u0027 Graves went to the refrigerator, but it was empty. When he came back he saw Nordmann strike a match, 5:15. Graves bent over the tank and rubbed the lettering. It streaked on his finger. `Go to the window,\u0027 Graves said to a cop. `Use the bullhorn and clear the street below. Do you understand? Get everybody the hell away from the street.\u0027 The cop looked confused. `Go!\u0027 The cop ran. Graves pushed at the surface of the tank in front of him. His finger left a minute indentation. `That\u0027s where your plastic explosive is,\u0027 he said. `It\u0027s wrapped around the tanks in thin strips - strips pressed through the rollers of an old washing machine. There must be a timer...\u0027 He ran his fingers quickly along the surface, feeling for lumps and irregularities. He couldn\u0027t find it, but he was in a hurry. `Christ,\u0027 Lewis said, pointing his sniffer. `This is it. Plastic explosive.\u0027 `The timer, the timer...\u0027 `It\u0027s after five fifteen,\u0027 Nordmann said. `Get those cops in the stairway away from that tank,\u0027 Graves said. `Tell them to drop it and run.\u0027 His fingers raced along the surface, back and forth. But it was eight feet of tank - too much surface to cover easily. It was probably a small timer, too. Perhaps miniaturized, perhaps the size of a thumbnail. `Damn!\u0027 `I get it,\u0027 Lewis said. `That was why he wanted inflammable plastic for the tanks. It\u0027ll explode and burn without leaving a -\u0027 `Coming up on five sixteen,\u0027 Nordmann said, looking at his watch. Where was the timer? `I can\u0027t find it,\u0027 Graves said. `Come on.\u0027 He picked up the tank by the nozzle and began dragging it back into the apartment. `Help me,\u0027 he said. There were three of them, but the 500-pound tank was bulky. As they entered the apartment, the cop at the window was on the bullhorn saying, `Clear the area, clear the area.\u0027 Graves had a quick glimpse out the window and saw that people were running. He helped lift the tank up to the sill. `Listen,\u0027 Nordmann said, `are you sure you should -\u0027 `No choice,\u0027 Graves said. `We\u0027ve got to get the tanks separated.\u0027 `Five sixteen,\u0027 somebody said. They pushed the tank out the window. The huge cylinder fell slowly, almost lazily, but picked up speed as it went. It was halfway to the street when it exploded in a violent ball of red and black flame. Graves and Nordmann, who had been looking out the window, were knocked back inside. A moment later there was a second explosion inside the building. The walls shook. The men looked at each other. Everyone was pale.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/binary/page-15.html","bookId":2408,"book":{"id":2408,"title":"Binary","description":"Storyline: Binary (Hard Case Crime MC8) by John Lange, Michael Crichton Political radical John Wright is plotting an act of mass destruction – and federal agent John Graves has him under surveillance, trying to figure out what the plot is.
