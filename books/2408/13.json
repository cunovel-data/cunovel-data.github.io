As the Alfa bore down on them,they dropped to their knees, holding their guns stiffarmed before them.\n `Don\u0027t shoot!\u0027 Graves screamed.\n The cops began to fire. The tyres on the Alfa exploded. The front windshield shattered. The car wobbled, flipped on its side, and slammed into a parked car. The horn began to blare.\n Graves ran over to the Alfa and tried to open the door. It was jammed shut. He looked in through the shattered windscreen and saw Wright\u0027s face, a bloody pulp, the features indistinguishable. As he watched, a tiny stream of blood spurted rhythmically from Wright\u0027s neck. Then it became a seeping red stain across his collar.\n He turned away from the car.\n `Is he dead?\u0027 Phelps said, running up.\n `Yes,\u0027 Graves said. `He\u0027s dead.\u0027\n `How can we turn off that fucking horn?\u0027 Phelps said.\n Graves stared at him and walked away.\n HOUR 1\n SAN DIEGO\n 4 PM PDT\n His sense of shock was profound. Of all the alternatives, of all the possibilities and options, he had never expected this. He had never expected Wright to die.\n Graves walked back up the street slowly, trying to gather his thoughts. What did he do next?\n Nordmann came up to him. `That\u0027s a damned shame,\u0027 he said.\n `You bet it is,\u0027 Graves said.\n Nordmann looked at the crowd clustered around the wrecked car. `One thing, though,\u0027 he said.\n `What\u0027s that?\u0027\n `It proves he could make a mistake.\u0027\n `It was a big one,\u0027 Graves said.\n `Yes,\u0027 Nordmann said, in a calm, logical voice. `But it was a mistake.\u0027\n Graves nodded and walked back towards the surveillance building. He thought about what Nordmann had said. The more he thought about it, the more encouraged he was. Because Nordmann was right.\n Wright had erred. And that was encouraging.\n One of the aides came running out of the building, waving Wright\u0027s ticket. `Mr Graves,\u0027 he said. `There\u0027s something very strange going on. We just checked this ticket. He cancelled that reservation yesterday.\u0027\n Protect me from fools, Graves thought. `Of course he did.\u0027\n `Of course?\u0027\n `Look,\u0027 Graves said. `He planned to let us catch him, and he planned his escape. But he couldn\u0027t get far if we knew his real aeroplane reservation, could he?\u0027\n `Well, I guess not...\u0027\n `Keep checking the airlines. Check Los Angeles, too. You\u0027ll find he had a reservation somewhere.\u0027\n Phelps came over. `The sniffer\u0027s arrived.\u0027\n `Has it? Good.\u0027 Graves walked across the street to Wright\u0027s apartment building. Phelps trailed behind him in silence.\n Finally Phelps said, `I hope you know what you\u0027re doing.\u0027\n Graves didn\u0027t answer. Because the fact was that he didn\u0027t know what he was doing. He knew only in a general way what Wright intended. Wright had made Graves a part of the total mechanism, and therefore Graves would have to cancel himself out - inactivate himself - by not doing what was expected of him.\n In order to do that, he had to decipher as many elements of the total staging mechanism as possible. Only then could he determine how he was intended to participate in the staging sequence that controlled the final release of the gas.\n The sniffer was the first step in deciphering the sequence.\n Graves stood outside the door to Wright\u0027s apartment. Next to him Lewis held a gunlike instrument in his hand. The gun was attached to a shoulder pack with a dial. Lewis pointed the instrument at the door and ran it along the cracks and seams.\n Behind them at the far end of the hallway, six people, including Phelps, stood and watched. Graves wanted everyone away from the door so that they wouldn\u0027t accidentally trip the vibration sensors. He didn\u0027t know how sensitively they were tuned, but he wasn\u0027t taking any chances.\n After a moment Lewis turned away with the instrument. `Wow,\u0027 he said.\n `You get a reading?\u0027\n `Yeah,\u0027 he said. `High nitrogen and oxygen content, trace phosphorus.\u0027\n `Meaning?\u0027\n `Plastic explosive, very near.\u0027\n `Near the door?\u0027\n `Probably just on the other side,\u0027 he said.\n Graves said, `Is there any chance you\u0027re wrong?\u0027\n `The sniffer is never wrong,\u0027 he said. `You\u0027ve got oxide of nitrogen fumes, and that\u0027s explosives. You can count on it.\u0027\n `All right,\u0027 Graves said. He walked away from the door. He had to trust the sniffer. It had been developed for use in Vietnam and had been adapted for customs operations, smuggling, and so on. It was incredibly sensitive and incredibly accurate. If the sniffer said plastic explosive was behind the door, he had to believe it. He walked back to Phelps at the end of the hallway.\n `Well?\u0027\n `There\u0027s explosive on the other side of the door.\u0027\n `Nice,\u0027 Phelps said. `What do we do now?\u0027\n `Try to get a better look inside the apartment,\u0027 Graves said. He glanced at his watch.\n `It\u0027s four ten,\u0027 Phelps said. `When did your friend say it would go off?\u0027\n `Five,\u0027 Graves said.\n `I hope you know what you\u0027re doing,\u0027 Phelps said again.\n Graves sighed. He wondered if he could ever explain to Phelps that that wasn\u0027t the problem. The problem was figuring out what Wright expected him to do - and then not doing it.\n Across the street in the surveillance room looking down on Wright\u0027s apartment, he talked to Nordmann. Nordmann had brought a cardboard box full of medical supplies - syringes, needles, bottles of liquid. He was frowning down at it. `This is the best I could manage on short notice,\u0027 he said.\n `Will it work?\u0027 Graves said.\n `It\u0027s the standard therapy,\u0027 Nordmann said. `But we haven\u0027t got much. This quantity will treat two or three people for exposure, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n `Then let\u0027s make sure it doesn\u0027t come to that.\u0027\n Nordmann smiled slightly. `It better not,\u0027 he said. `Because you need somebody alive and well to administer it.\u0027\n `Is it hard to administer?\u0027\n `Tricky,\u0027 Nordmann said. `There are two different chemicals, atropine and parladoxime. They have to be balanced.\u0027\n Graves sighed. `So the antidote is a binary, too.\u0027\n `In a sense. The two chemicals treat different effects of the gas. One treats the peripheral nervous system, the other the central. The chemicals are dangerous in themselves, which makes it all much harder.\u0027\n `Fighting fire with fire?\u0027\n `In a sense,\u0027 Nordmann said.\n The two men stood staring out the window at the apartment opposite. Phelps was in a corner using a walkie-talkie. `You in position?\u0027\n A response crackled back. `In position, sir.\u0027\n `Very good.\u0027 Phelps clicked off the walkie-talkie. `We\u0027ve got two cops stationed outside the door to that apartment,\u0027 he said.\n `Fine,\u0027 Graves said. `Just so they don\u0027t get too close to the door.\u0027\n `I have them ten feet away.\u0027\n `That should be fine.\u0027\n In the hallway outside Wright\u0027s apartment, officers Martin and Jencks of the San Diego Police Department stared at the closed door and leaned against the wall.\n `You understand any of this?\u0027 Jencks said.\n `Nope,\u0027 Martin said.\n `But they said not to get too close to the door.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027\n `You know why?\u0027\n `I don\u0027t know nothing,\u0027 Martin said. He took out a cigarette. `You got a match?\u0027\n `Maybe we shouldn\u0027t smoke...\u0027\n `Who\u0027s going to know?\u0027 Martin said.\n Jencks gave him a match.\n Graves stood with Nordmann in the surveillance room across the street.\n \u0027Wright booby-trapped the apartment?\u0027\n `Elaborately,\u0027 Graves said. `He told me some of it. I\u0027m sure he didn\u0027t tell me everything.\u0027\n `And it goes off at five?\u0027\n `Yes.\u0027\n `Forty-five minutes from now,\u0027 Nordmann said. `Is the Navy sending people with protective suits? Because protected people could just walk right in.\u0027\n `Nobody can walk right in,\u0027 Graves said. `He\u0027s wired the room with explosive. That\u0027s why we\u0027ve got the guards over there.\u0027\n Nordmann grimaced. `Explosive?\u0027\n `Twenty pounds of it.\u0027\n The TV in the corner of the room showed the Convention. A monotonous voice was saying, `Mr Chairman... Mr Chairman, we request the floor... Mr Chairman...\u0027 There was the loud banging of a gavel.\n `Turn that damned thing off,\u0027 Graves said. Someone turned it off.\n At the window two men grunted as they lifted a huge lens onto a heavy-duty tripod. It was screwed into place and adjusted. `Ready, Mr Graves.\u0027\n `Thank you.\u0027 Graves went to the window.\n `What\u0027s that?\u0027 Nordmann said.\n `A fifteen-hundred-millimeter telephoto,\u0027 Graves said. `It\u0027s the best look we can get.\u0027\n He peered through the giant lens. The view was so enormously magnified that at first he didn\u0027t know what he was looking at. Using a fine-knurled knob, he moved the lens and saw he was focused on a crack in the floor. He moved across the floor to the boxes. He shifted the lens upward, examining each box in detail.\n `Take a look at this,\u0027 he said, stepping away.\n Nordmann squinted through the lens. `Three stacked boxes,\u0027 he said. `I can\u0027t make out much...\u0027\n `Neither can L\u0027 Graves folded his arms across his chest and stared out the window. He tried to think logically, but he was having trouble; Wright\u0027s death had unnerved him, whether he wanted to admit it or not.\n And the system seemed so complicated. Staging sequences, timers, vibration sensors, explosives... His head ached. How the hell would he unravel it?\n `Let\u0027s work it backward,\u0027 Nordmann said. `What\u0027s the most important element in the system?\u0027\n `The gas.\u0027\n `How is it controlled?\u0027\n `There are spring-loaded valve mechanisms. They can be tripped by a solenoid.\u0027\n `And they presumably have a timer of some kind.\u0027\n `Presumably.\u0027\n `Battery-powered or line-powered?\u0027\n `Well, he\u0027s plugged one of the boxes into the wall. But the valve mechanisms are probably batterypowered.\u0027\n Nordmann nodded. `That makes sense,\u0027 he said. `He wouldn\u0027t have the most important elements dependent on an external system. So what did he plug into the wall?\u0027\n `I don\u0027t know.\u0027\n `Vibration sensors?\u0027\n `Maybe,\u0027 Graves said. He looked at his watch. It was 4:20. He would have to move soon. What had Wright expected him to do? The psychological report was folded up in his pocket. He took it out and looked at the last few lines.\n IF THERE ARE ANY DEFECTS OR HIDDEN FLAWS IN HIS BEHAVIOUR, THEY ARE HIS IMPULSIVENESS AND HIS DESIRE TO FINISH A TEST SITUATION RAPIDLY.\n Well, he didn\u0027t have much choice now. He was going to have to make a move, and soon.\n `You know,\u0027 Nordmann said thoughtfully, `most of the equipment in that room is defensive. It\u0027s designed to keep people out of there until the gas is ready to be released. But I suspect some of those defences. are meant to be penetrated.\u0027\n `I agree,\u0027 Graves said. `And in any case, we have to start penetrating.\u0027\n `Wall current first?\u0027 Nordmann asked.\n Graves nodded. He glanced at Phelps, who was sitting in a corner of the room literally chewing his nails. Graves sent Lewis across the street to disconnect power to the apartment. Four minutes later, the power was off. Graves watched through the big telephoto lens. He saw a single yellow pilot light in the vibration sensor box go out.\n `Well,\u0027 Nordmann said, `that\u0027s a start. We\u0027ve killed part of the system.\u0027\n `Have we?\u0027 Graves said. He watched through the telephoto as the solenoid mechanism tripped open the tank valves, then a moment later tripped them shut.\n The apartment became filled with whitish gas.\n `What\u0027s happening?\u0027 Phelps said, very agitated.\n `Quick,\u0027 Graves said. `Those cops. Tell the cops.\u0027\n `What cops?\u0027 Phelps said.\n Officer Martin finished his cigarette and ground it out on the floor. His heel squeaked.\n `Sssh,\u0027 Jencks said, suddenly tense.\n `What is it?\u0027\n `Sssssh. Listen.\u0027\n The two men listened in silence. There was a hissing. `You hear that?\u0027 Jencks said.\n `Yeah. It\u0027s coming from the room.\u0027\n `Are you sure?\u0027\n Martin moved closer to the door. `I think so -\u0027\n `Maybe you shouldn\u0027t -\u0027\n Martin began to cough. His nose ran. `Shit,\u0027 he said. `What is this?\u0027 He coughed again.\n Jencks went forward to help him. Then Jencks felt the stinging in his nostrils, and the liquid began to pour over his shirt. He didn\u0027t know a nose could run that way. His eyes ached and stung; he felt dizzy. `What the hell...\u0027 He had a coughing fit.\n The walkie-talkie crackled. `This is Phelps,\u0027 a voice said. `Over.\u0027\n Martin took a step towards the walkie-talkie and fell to the floor. Now he could see the faint wispy whiteness seeping through the door.\n `This is Phelps. Over.\u0027\n Jencks was coughing loudly and groaning.\n Martin stretched out his hand towards the walkietalkie. He was weak. His arm trembled. Then, without warning, he vomited and lost consciousness.\n `I\u0027m not getting an answer,\u0027 Phelps said.\n Graves and Nordmann exchanged glances, then looked back out the window at the opposite apartment. The room now had a faint milky haze.\n `Are they dead?\u0027 Phelps said.\n `Probably.\u0027\n `How can you just stand there?F\n \u0027Because,\u0027 Graves said, `it was just a short burst. The valves are turned off again.\u0027\n Phelps looked puzzled.\n `It wasn\u0027t a full release,\u0027 Graves said. `It\u0027s just a partial release, to fill the room with gas. That\u0027s why Wright carefully closed the windows. Now we really can\u0027t get in there.\u0027\n `You sound so appreciative,\u0027 Phelps said.\n `I\u0027m not. But we understand now what Wright meant by a complex staging sequence.\u0027\n `God damn it, this is not a jigsaw puzzle! Two cops have died and -\u0027\n `We\u0027re all right,\u0027 Nordmann said quietly, `until five PM.,\n \u0027And what do you intend to do between now and then?\u0027 Phelps demanded angrily. `I\u0027m going to call the Navy,\u0027 he said. `Their men were supposed to be here an hour ago. It\u0027s four thirty now.\u0027\n Graves stared at the gas-filled apartment. He had a brief mental image of the two cops staggering drunkenly in the hallway. He pushed it away; he could consider it later.\n Beside him Nordmann said, `It\u0027s really quite clever.\u0027\n Graves said, `How thick is the gas in that room?\u0027\n `Hard to say,\u0027 Nordmann said. `The normal colour of the gas is white. I don\u0027t think the density is very great. Why?\u0027\n `If you shot me full of those antidotes, could I survive the atmosphere in that room?\u0027\n `I don\u0027t know.\u0027\n `Would I have a chance?\u0027\n `A chance? Of course. But even if you could survive, how would you get in? You said yourself it\u0027s wired with explosives. You can\u0027t go in the front door.\u0027\n `I wasn\u0027t thinking of the door,\u0027 Graves said. `I was thinking of the window.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/binary/page-13.html","bookId":2408,"book":{"id":2408,"title":"Binary","description":"Storyline: \n Binary (Hard Case Crime MC8) \n by John Lange, Michael Crichton \n Political radical John Wright is plotting an act of mass destruction – and federal agent John Graves has him under surveillance, trying to figure out what the plot is. \n When a government computer is hacked and a high-security shipment of nerve gas gets hijacked, Graves puts the pieces together – but can he stop Wright from unleashing his weapon before it kills a million people ... including the President of the United States?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/binary.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/binary.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:46 AM"}}
