They were long distance.\u0027\n `Did you hear any of them?\u0027\n `No.\u0027\n `Are you sure?s\n \u0027Well, I heard him ask the operator for area code 801. That\u0027s Washington, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n `Yes,\u0027 Graves said. He knew that it wasn\u0027t, but he could check it later.\n `He was very upset. And then later, he mentioned China. He doesn\u0027t like the President about China, you know.\u0027 She sighed. `He thinks it\u0027s very wrong.\u0027\n `I see. You say you\u0027ve seen my picture -\u0027\n `Only last night,\u0027 she said. `That was the first time. I thought you were related to him or something. Because he has your picture up all over the place.\u0027\n `This happened last night?\u0027\n `Yes. But he was strange last night, anyway. Nervous.\u0027 `I see. What about?\u0027\n `I don\u0027t know. He\u0027s worried about business things. He said something about a shipment he\u0027s expecting.\u0027\n `What else was strange, last night?\u0027\n She hesitated, apparently embarrassed.\n `Go on,\u0027 Graves said gently.\n `Well, it was different last night. He was very. vigorous. He did it three times.\u0027\n `I see,\u0027 Graves said.\n Outside the ballroom Lewis was in a phone booth, checking the area code. He came out and fell into step with Graves. `Eight oh one,\u0027 he said, `is Utah.\u0027\n `Any particular place?\u0027\n `No. The whole state is one area code.\u0027\n `Shit,\u0027 Graves said. `I wish we had a tap on his phone.\u0027 `Well, we did our best to get it,\u0027 Lewis reminded him. `Yeah,\u0027 Graves said. He sighed. `I never thought I\u0027d hear myself complaining because we hadn\u0027t tapped a phone.\u0027\n `Things are different now,\u0027 Lewis said.\n `They sure are.\u0027\n They went outside into the bright hot morning sun and climbed into the car. Lewis started the engine. `Where to?\u0027\n `Miss Lembeck\u0027s new apartment. The one Wright just rented.\u0027\n `Okay,\u0027 Lewis said.\n When they arrived at the apartment building, they saw Wright\u0027s limousine parked in front. Behind the wheel George was reading a newspaper.\n `Are we fully set up across the street?\u0027 Graves said.\n `We should be,\u0027 Lewis said.\n Graves nodded. `Wait here. I\u0027ll go see what they\u0027ve found.\u0027\n The day before, they had set up a surveillance unit in the apartment building facing Wright\u0027s. Graves rode to the nineteenth floor, got out, and walked to Room 1905. He knocked once.\n `Who is it?\u0027\n `Graves.\u0027\n The door was opened for him. He entered the room. It was small and bare except for equipment clustered around the windows. There were two sets of binoculars on tripods and three sets of cameras; four chairs; a directional microphone, also on a tripod; recording equipment; film canisters; heaped ashtrays. And a television set.\n On the TV Walter Cronkite was saying, `- are trying to get a vote from the Alabama delegation, which is apparently still in caucus.\u0027 In the background a booming, echoing mechanical voice was saying, `Alabama\n Alabama... Alabama...\u0027\n Graves ignored the TV. `What\u0027ve you got?\u0027 he asked.\n One of the three men in the room stepped away from the binoculars. `Have a look,\u0027 he said.\n Graves looked.\n From this vantage point he could see directly into one window of Wright\u0027s apartment on the nineteenth floor of the opposite building. There were no drapes on the window, which made it easy to see in. The room was bare except for four peculiar wooden structures standing in the centre of the floor.\n `They had drapes on that window too,\u0027 the man said, `but they took them off half an hour ago.\u0027\n `From all the windows?\u0027\n `No. Just this one.\u0027\n Graves frowned. Why? Did they know they were being observed? Did they want to make it easier? Because that was what they had done. He could see Wright striding around the room, directing two other people. Wright was working in shirtsleeves.\n `The window\u0027s open,\u0027 Graves said. `It must be hot as hell in there.\u0027\n `That\u0027s right,\u0027 the man said. `The window has been open ever since Wright showed up. An hour ago.\u0027\n `What\u0027re those wooden things on the floor?\u0027\n `Sawhorses,\u0027 the man said. `We figure they had paperhangers in there. Paperhangers use sawhorses. But there\u0027s something funny going on.\u0027\n `How do you mean?\u0027\n `Well, look at the sawhorses closely. They have indentations cut in them.\u0027\n Graves looked. He could see a broadly curved, U-shaped cut in each sawhorse.\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n `Beats me. They just cut them a while back.\u0027\n `You mean, specially?\u0027\n `That\u0027s right. They\u0027ve been doing a lot of unusual things in there. Every so often Wright sticks his hand out the window, and he\u0027s got this whirling thing, like a kid\u0027s whirling top... He sticks his hand out there for a minute, then pulls it back.\u0027\n Graves looked away from the window. `Describe it exactly.\u0027\n `It has four arms,\u0027 the man said, `and at the end of each is a cup, to catch the wind. Sort of a weathervane. But there isn\u0027t much wind today.\u0027\n `Anemometer,\u0027 Graves said.\n `A what?\u0027\n `It measures wind velocity.\u0027 Why should Wright want to know the wind velocity outside the window of his girl friend\u0027s apartment?,\n `Why does he care about that?\u0027 the man said.\n Graves shook his head and turned back to the window, examining the sawhorses through the binoculars. Each sawhorse with its single indentation in the crossbar.\n Four sawhorses.\n Two tanks. Of course! The crossbars would have indentations so that the tank wouldn\u0027t roll off. `You seen any tanks in there?\u0027\n `Nothing like that,\u0027 the man said. `All we\u0027ve seen is a lot of mechanical equipment.\u0027\n `What kind of mechanical equipment?\u0027 Graves peered through the binoculars. He didn\u0027t see any equipment at all.\n `It looks like pumps and stuff,\u0027 the man said. `It was right in the middle of the floor.\u0027 He glanced through the binoculars, then shook his head. `They must have moved it to another room. They had some electronic equipment, too.\u0027\n `What kind?\u0027\n `Looked like a hi-fi, maybe.\u0027\n Graves thought of several nasty remarks, but said nothing. A hi-fi, for Christ\u0027s sake.\n `That guy in there must be pretty weird,\u0027 the man said.\n Graves turned on him. `He is not weird. He is a brilliant and a dedicated man. He is engaged in a complicated plot and he is daring -\u0027 He broke off. The man was staring. `He\u0027s not weird,\u0027 Graves finished, and returned to the binoculars.\n As he watched, John Wright stepped to the window and extended his hand. He held an anemometer; the cups spun lazily. After a moment Wright withdrew the instrument and returned to directing the other men in the room.\n Graves turned away from the window and made some calls.\n `Department of Defence.\u0027\n `Public Information, please.\u0027\n `Just a minute, please.\u0027 There was a clicking.\n `Public Information, Miss,Conover speaking.\u0027\n `I\u0027d like to talk to Lieutenant Morrison, please.\u0027\n `One minute, please.\u0027 More clicking.\n `Lieutenant Morrison\u0027s office.\u0027\n `John Graves calling for Lieutenant Morrison.\u0027\n `Just a minute, I\u0027ll see if he\u0027s in.\u0027 Still more clicking. \u0027Morrison here. What is it?\u0027 As usual, Morrison sounded harried.\n `Pete, this is John Graves at State. I\u0027m in San Diego, and I need some information.\u0027\n `Shoot.\u0027\n `Pete, I need to know what a code word represents. The code word is Binary 75 slash 76.\u0027\n Morrison coughed in surprise. `Where\u0027d you hear that?\u0027\n `Pete, just tell me what it means.\u0027\n `Jesus, this is an open line.\u0027\n `I know it\u0027s an open line. Tell me what it means.\u0027\n `Where are you calling from?\u0027\n `San Diego.\u0027\n `Jesus, you must be out of your mind.\u0027\n `I need the information, Pete. And I need it now.\u0027\n `Look,\u0027 Morrison said, `if you don\u0027t mind me saying so, this is pretty irregular. You\u0027ve just popped a -\u0027 He broke off again. `Honestly,\u0027 he said, in his most honest, public-information officer\u0027s voice, `I\u0027d have to obtain clearances and confirmation of need-to-know from your department, and then I\u0027d have to pass it on to the Army, and then -\u0027\n `Okay, fine. Do it.\u0027\n `You have to supply the clearances.\u0027\n `I haven\u0027t got time.\u0027\n `You\u0027re asking me on an open line to define a hot new weapons system and break its code and you haven\u0027t got \u0027\n `Look,\u0027 Graves said. `If I call Phelps, can he call you and requisition this information?\u0027\n \u0027Verbal requisition?\u0027 Morrison seemed shocked. `This is pretty heavy stuff for a verbal. You sure you don\u0027t want specifications on the ABM sites while you\u0027re at it, and maybe Polaris submarine coordinates? Any other minor details?\u0027\n Graves suppressed his anger. Morrison was such a bureaucratic ass. `I need the information,\u0027 he repeated. `I need it now.\u0027\n `Sounds like this may be a matter for Defence to look into,\u0027 Morrison said. `We\u0027d be curious to know how you got that coding in the first place. Why don\u0027t you forward us a complete report along with a requisition AB-212; that\u0027s the green form. I may be able to release the data to you in a day or so, and -\u0027\n Graves hung up.\n `This is Graves.\u0027\n `I know who it is,\u0027 Phelps said. `What do you have to say for yourself?\u0027\n \u0027Binary 75 slash 76,\u0027 Graves said. `It\u0027s a coding - I need to know what it means.\u0027\n `Binary 75 slash 76,\u0027 Phelps said. There was a long pause; faintly, Graves could hear him writing it down. Finally he said, `Are you going to tell me where you came across it?\u0027\n `It\u0027s what Drew tapped from the system,\u0027 Graves said\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 Phelps said.\n `But Drew doesn\u0027t know what it means, either.\u0027\n `How did he happen to tap in?\u0027\n \u0027Wright told him to.\u0027\n `Well, did you ask Wright why?\u0027\n `No.\u0027\n `Why not?\u0027\n `I haven\u0027t picked him up yet,\u0027 Graves said.\n `You haven\u0027t picked him up yet.\u0027\n `That\u0027s right.\u0027\n `What are you waiting for, a divine edict?\u0027\n `I thought I already had that,\u0027 Graves said. `But the situation is complicated. You see, Wright asked for more information from the data banks.\u0027\n `More information?\u0027\n `About a State Department Intelligence officer named John Graves. He pulled my file.\u0027\n `Don\u0027t be an ass,\u0027 Phelps said. `Pick him up immediately. He\u0027s on to you, that\u0027s clear.\u0027\n `Not only is he on to me,\u0027 Graves said, `he\u0027s showing me a puzzle and daring me to work it out.\u0027\n `This is not a fucking poker game,\u0027 Phelps said. `We can convict Wright on the basis of evidence we already have, and -\u0027\n `You can\u0027t touch him,\u0027 Graves said. `When he cools down, Drew won\u0027t testify against him. You haven\u0027t got a prayer of making a case against Wright. Our only chance is to wait - and to get me my own file contents.\u0027\n `You\u0027re joking.\u0027\n `I\u0027m not.\u0027\n `It\u0027s out of the question.\u0027\n `I want to know what he knows.\u0027\n `About yourself?\u0027\n `Yes. Especially psychological test scores.\u0027\n `Out of the question. Unheard of.\u0027\n `You\u0027ve got to do this for me,\u0027 Graves said. `You\u0027ve got to get me that file.\u0027\n `I can\u0027t requisition it,\u0027 Phelps said, `without higher\n authority. You know that. You\u0027re much better off picking Wright up.\u0027\n `Not yet.\u0027\n `I have to go to lunch,\u0027 Phelps said. `Call me later. I think you\u0027re acting like a fool.\u0027\n And Phelps hung up.\n `State Department.\u0027 A singsong voice.\n \u0027Office of the Secretary, please.\u0027\n `Thank you.\u0027 Lilting.\n `Secretary of State, can we help you?\u0027\n `Mr Burnett, please.\u0027 Burnett was one of the Secretary\u0027s advisers. Although young, he had worked himself up from a speech writer to a close and influential position. Graves knew him slightly.\n `Mr Burnett has gone to lunch and is not back yet. He is expected shortly.\u0027\n `Did he leave a number?\u0027\n `No, I\u0027m sorry - just a moment, he\u0027s coming through the door. Whom shall I say is calling?\u0027\n `John Graves. State Intelligence.\u0027\n `One moment please, Mr Graves.\u0027\n There was a very long wait, and a humming sound as Graves was put on `hold\u0027. Then a click.\n \u0027Burnett here.\u0027\n `Tom, this is John Graves calling.\u0027\n `How are you, John? It\u0027s been a long time. When was it? Senator Evans\u0027 party, I think. You had a very cute -\u0027\n `Listen, Tom. I have a problem. I need your help.\u0027\n `I\u0027ll do what I can.\u0027 Said very smoothly, in the manner that all those people adopted sooner or later. No promises, but very smooth.\n Graves paused. `I need my file.\u0027\n `Your file?\u0027\n `Yes. My Department file.\u0027\n `I don\u0027t think - just a minute - no, please hold that, I\u0027ll call him right back - John?\u0027\n `I\u0027m here.\u0027\n `I\u0027ll have to call him right back. Yes, in a few minutes. Absolutely. Five minutes, tell him five minutes. John?\u0027\n `I\u0027m here,\u0027 Graves said again.\n `Now what was it? Your file?\u0027\n `Yes. I need my own file.\u0027\n `I\u0027ve never heard of anyone needing their own file,\u0027 Burnett chuckled. `Curiosity, yes, but -\u0027\n `Tom. Stop being polite. This is Department business and it\u0027s very important.\u0027\n `Perhaps you could stop by the office and -\u0027\n `I can\u0027t stop by the office. I\u0027m not in Washington. I\u0027m in San Diego.\u0027\n `Oh?\u0027 There was hesitation now, the smoothness gone. `San Diego?\u0027\n `I\u0027m doing an SS here. A guy named John Wright. I need my own -\u0027\n \u0027Who?\u0027\n `John Wright.\u0027\n `Well why didn\u0027t you say so before? I\u0027ll get it to you right away. The Secretary has directed everyone to cooperate fully with the San Diego operation.\u0027\n Graves sighed. That was refreshing. He had an enormous sense of relief. What was that joke? It felt so good when he stopped.\n `Let\u0027s see,\u0027 Burnett said. `I\u0027ll have to get an authorization. I can do that with the Undersecretary; I don\u0027t have to bother the boss. Then we have to get it to you. You don\u0027t have access to a photoprinter?\u0027\n `No.\u0027\n `Well, let\u0027s see... I don\u0027t know what sort of facilities are available in San Diego. Look. There\u0027s one sure bet. The police department. They have a printer for sure. I can transmit the file contents to you over that. But it\u0027ll take time to do the whole thing.\u0027\n `I don\u0027t want the whole thing. I just want the psychological test scores.\u0027\n `You do?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 Graves said.\n `Well,\u0027 Burnett said, `I can have that for you right away. They\u0027ll transmit in fifteen or twenty minutes. Okay?\u0027\n `Okay,\u0027 Graves said. `And thanks.\u0027\n `For Christ\u0027s sake, don\u0027t mention it,\u0027 Burnett said.\n Graves hung up.\n Downstairs in the car, Lewis said, `You look like you\u0027ve gargled with Drano.\u0027\n `I have,\u0027 Graves said. He got into the car. `We\u0027re going to the police station.\u0027\n Lewis pulled out into traffic. `Anything interesting happening upstairs?\u0027\n `They\u0027ve found that Wright is preoccupied with weather today.\u0027\n `Weather?\u0027\n `Yes.\u0027\n `I don\u0027t get it,\u0027 Lewis said.\n `Neither do I,\u0027 Graves said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/binary/page-8.html","bookId":2408,"book":{"id":2408,"title":"Binary","description":"Storyline: \n Binary (Hard Case Crime MC8) \n by John Lange, Michael Crichton \n Political radical John Wright is plotting an act of mass destruction – and federal agent John Graves has him under surveillance, trying to figure out what the plot is. \n When a government computer is hacked and a high-security shipment of nerve gas gets hijacked, Graves puts the pieces together – but can he stop Wright from unleashing his weapon before it kills a million people ... including the President of the United States?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/binary.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/binary.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:46 AM"}}
