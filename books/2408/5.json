Normally on Wednesday mornings Wright went to Balboa Park, where he walked in the gardens, fed the pigeons, and relaxed. But he wasn\u0027t doing that today. He was going downtown. `Where\u0027s our other car?\u0027 Graves said. Lewis picked up the car radio receiver. `701 to 702. Where are you?\u0027 There was a hiss of static. \"701, we\u0027re at Third and B, going downtown.\u0027 Lewis glanced at Graves, who nodded. `Very good, 702,\u0027 Lewis said, and clicked off. The second car, the dry cleaning van, was running in advance of the limousine. That was standard procedure - one car tailing from the front, one from behind. In cities on really big jobs, they sometimes used four cars, working all around the suspect car. That made it impossible to lose the suspect. But Graves didn\u0027t want a four-car tail, and in any case Phelps would never have approved the expense. The limousine went down Third to Avenue A, then turned left going west. `702, you have him?F \u0027We still have him.\u0027 Lewis followed the limousine as it went crosstown on A and stopped, pulling up in front of a warehouse. Lewis pulled to the kerb half a block behind. They watched as Wright got out and went inside. Graves lit a cigarette, and they waited. But after only a minute or so, Wright reappeared and got back into his car. The limousine started off. `Wonder what that was about?\u0027 Lewis said. As they passed the warehouse, Graves read the lettering. He was surprised to find it wasn\u0027t a warehouse at all. BURNS BROS PLASTICS VACUUM MOULDING Containers of all sons `Damned if I know,\u0027 Graves said. He made a note of the name and address in his notebook and then looked up at the street. The limousine was going north now. It went two blocks and turned left, then left again. It pulled up in front of another warehouse. `It seems he\u0027s doing some shopping,\u0027 Lewis said. `He\u0027s in the wrong part of town.\u0027 `I\u0027ll drive past,\u0027 Lewis said, and continued smoothly past the warehouse and the parked limousine. Graves looked out of the corner of his eye. He saw George, the chauffeur, lighting a cigarette. He saw the large glass windows of the warehouse, which was also a salesroom of some kind. Inside he saw Wright standing at the counter receiving a package. In the window were displayed various shining pieces of laboratory equipment. SANDERSON SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLY Serving Hospitals and Laboratories Since 1953 Graves had to smile. Only in California would a date like 1953 seem proof of ageless service to the consumer. `We\u0027ll wait for him here,\u0027 he said, and Lewis pulled over at the end of the block and cut the engine. Graves checked his watch. It was 8:39. A moment later the limousine sped past them while he was making a note of the scientific supply company and its address. Lewis followed a short distance behind. The limo again went uptown and pulled over in front of a machine shop. Wright got out and was met at the door by a man carrying a small paper bag. Wright shook hands with the man, who was dressed in dungarees and a blue work shirt. Then Wright opened the paper bag to look inside. He removed one small, shiny metal object, nodded, exchanged a few more words with the man, and got back into his car. The limousine drove off. As they passed the machine shop, Graves noted the address and the name. He stared at his list. `A plastics manufacturer, a scientific supply house, and now a machine shop.\u0027 `He isn\u0027t buying presents for his girls,\u0027 Lewis said, and laughed. `Did you check out that purchase last week?\u0027 The week before, Wright had also visited several small industrial manufacturers. `Yeah,\u0027 Lewis said. `It was two twelve-foot lengths of flexible hosing. Very unusual.\u0027 `What\u0027s unusual about that?\u0027 `It was stainless steel.\u0027 `Meaning?\u0027 Lewis shrugged. `The guy I talked to said that nobody bought flexible stainless steel hosing any more. People use either plastic or something like aluminium. Stainless is only used for piping very corrosive materials.\u0027 `Such as?\u0027 `Concentrated dyes, corrosive gases, that kind of thing. The guy said it was pretty uncommon. Most highly corrosive stuff is pumped through glass piping. But of course, glass isn\u0027t flexible.\u0027 `And Wright bought two lengths of flexible steel?\u0027 `Right. Twelve-foot lengths. At eighty-three dollars a foot.\u0027 Graves nodded and watched the car. `He\u0027s buying a lot of specialized equipment. Why?\u0027 `You mean, why is he doing it?\u0027 `No,\u0027 Graves said. `I mean, why is he doing it himself, in person?\u0027 `I don\u0027t follow you. Why shouldn\u0027t he do it himself?\u0027 `Because he\u0027s too smart for that,\u0027 Graves said. The limousine went uptown twenty blocks and pulled over in front of another building. The sign said HARRELSON GARMENTS AND CUSTOM GOODS. They watched Wright get out of the limo and go inside. `I\u0027ll be goddamned,\u0027 Graves said. `What is it?\u0027 Lewis said. \u0027Harrelson was in the papers a year ago. They made rubber suits and whips and things like that; there was a minor scandal.\u0027 Lewis shook his head: `It really is true, then.\u0027 `What?\u0027 `About your memory.\u0027 Graves shook his head. He\u0027d been through all this before. `I don\u0027t have a photographic memory,\u0027 he said. `I have a better than average memory, that\u0027s all.\u0027 `Are you trying to convince me?\u0027 `No, just telling you.\u0027 `You sound sore.\u0027 `You better understand,\u0027 Graves said, `that I don\u0027t have any special powers. None at all. I just plod along, doing a job.\u0027 `Here he comes,\u0027 Lewis said. He pointed to Wright emerging from the store with an armful of packages wrapped in brown paper. George, the chauffeur, jumped out and came around to help carry the packages. Wright indicated that they were to go into the trunk of the car. George locked them there, then came around, shut Wright\u0027s door, and drove off. `I\u0027d like to know what was in those packages,\u0027 Graves said, making notes in his book. `Bet you anything it\u0027s kinky rubber clothing,\u0027 Lewis said. `What will you bet?\u0027 At that, Lewis laughed. He knew you didn\u0027t bet with Graves. Nobody bet with Graves. He might deny special skills until he was blue in the face, but the fact was that Graves was the best gambler, bettor, poker player that any of them had ever seen. They followed the car for another five minutes. Then it pulled up in front of a sporting goods store. Wright again got out. He said something to George, who nodded and went across the street to a coffee shop. The car was left alone. It could not be seen easily from either the sports store or the coffee shop. `Looks like we have our chance,\u0027 Graves said. `Pull over.\u0027 As Lewis pulled the sedan over, Graves opened the glove compartment and took out a large, circular key ring. On it were keys to Wright\u0027s apartment in New York, his apartment in San Diego, his limousine, his Alfa sportscar, his summer house in Southampton, his winter house irr Jamaica. And several others as well. They were all neatly tagged. Lewis said, `Isn\u0027t this a little risky \u0027 `We\u0027re going to arrest him today,\u0027 Graves said. `It doesn\u0027t matter now.\u0027 He got out of the car, feeling the heat of the morning air. He walked forward to the limousine. It took just a moment to insert his key in the trunk and open it. He raised the trunk lid partway and looked at the brown paper packages. There were three, closed with strips of tape. He opened a c. -aer of one and peered inside. The package contained black rubber belts, about six inches wide, formed into loops of varying diameters. He closed the package and squeezed the others. They all seemed to contain belts. Frowning, he shut the trunk. And then, because he was in a gambling mood, he walked into the sporting goods store. As he went through the door he glanced back at Lewis. Lewis looked horrified. The store was large and spacious; he did not see Wright immediately. Walking among the aisles of equipment, he finally spotted him in the water sports department. Wright was gesturing with his hands, forming a shape in the air. Graves walked over and stood beside him at the counter. To do so gave Graves an immediate burst of excitement. He had never been so close to his subject before. Wright was smaller than he had thought -several inches shorter than Graves himself. And much finer-boned. A delicate man in an English-cut suit, dapper as Phelps, but without the vanity that made Phelps unbearable. The salesman said, `I\u0027ll be right with you, sir,\u0027 and Graves nodded. Wright glanced over at him and smiled vaguely. There was no recognition in the glance. None at all: Graves was sure of it. They were just two customers at the same counter. Graves bent over, peering down at the glass case, which contained depth gauges and underwater watches. He could see Wright\u0027s face reflected in the glass surface. `Is this the one you mean, sir?\u0027 the salesman asked. Graves glanced up and saw the salesman holding a small air tank, painted yellow. `That\u0027s the one,\u0027 Wright said. `Now, do you understand about this tank?\u0027 the salesman said. `It\u0027s not the standard seventy-two cubic foot model. This one only has twenty-five minutes of air at -\u0027 `That\u0027s the one I want.\u0027 Wright said it quietly, but his voice cut the salesman off. Graves was impressed by the understated authority in the voice - and presumably in the man. `Yes, sir. How many was that?\u0027 `Three.\u0027 `I think we have three in the storeroom,\u0027 the salesman said. He turned to Graves: `Was there anything in particular?\u0027 It seemed to Graves that the salesman was much less deferential to him than he was to Wright. But perhaps he was being paranoid. `I need a depth gauge,\u0027 Graves said. `They\u0027re all down there,\u0027 the salesman said, pointing to the case. `Be with you in a minute. Three, was it, sir? I\u0027ll get them.\u0027 The salesman walked off. After a moment Graves said, `I don\u0027t know anything about this.\u0027 There was a short, ambiguous pause. Finally Wright said, `Diving?\u0027 `Yes. It\u0027s a present for my son.\u0027 `He does a lot of diving?\u0027 Wright was being formal, polite, barely interested. Wait until 1 put the handcuffs on, Graves thought. `Oh, he\u0027s a nut about it, but he doesn\u0027t really get much chance. Twice a year during school vacations we go down to Mexico. That\u0027s really all.\u0027 Wright said, `That one there is a good one.\u0027 He pointed to a gauge in the case. Graves nodded. `I really don\u0027t know anything about this,\u0027 he repeated. `You don\u0027t dive yourself?\u0027 `No,\u0027 Graves said. `It always seemed too dangerous to me.\u0027 `There\u0027s a certain thrill in danger, though.\u0027 `Not for me. Not at my age.\u0027 `You prefer golf?\u0027 `Poker,\u0027 Graves said, and looked directly at Wright for the first time. Wright smiled. `Poker can be very challenging,\u0027 he said. `But it\u0027s like any other game. If you get too good, you\u0027re limited in your opponents.\u0027 `Yes, I\u0027ve found that.\u0027 `You\u0027re good?\u0027 There was just the slightest taunt in the voice, the slightest goading. `Yes, I\u0027m good,\u0027 Graves found himself saying. For a moment the two men exchanged a level, appraising look. Wright broke it; he looked down at the counter. `Still,\u0027 he said, `I admire the young, with their exuberance in physical sports. It raises the stakes. You can be hurt, you can be injured. You can even be killed.\u0027 `But when you\u0027re young, you don\u0027t think of that. It doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027 `Oh,\u0027 Wright said, `I think it always matters. Dying always matters.\u0027 The salesman came back. `You\u0027re in luck, Mr Johnson,\u0027 he said cheerfully. `You got the last three tanks. Shall I have them put in your car?\u0027 `That will be fine,\u0027 Wright said, smiling. `You must be out of your mind,\u0027 Lewis said. They were back in the car, following the limousine. `Not at all.\u0027 `I suppose you went up and talked to him.\u0027 `As a matter of fact, I did.\u0027 Lewis smiled. `I know you\u0027ve been doing this a long time, but still...\u0027 `Look,\u0027 Graves said, `we\u0027re picking him up later today.\u0027 `But you\u0027re teasing him, playing a game...\u0027 `Of course,\u0027 Graves said. The limousine went up Avenue D and pulled to a stop in front of a large hotel. A man came out, bent over the limo, and talked to Wright in the back seat. The conversation lasted several minutes. Finally the man turned and went inside. The limousine pulled away from the kerb. Graves snatched up the microphone. `701 to 702.\u0027 `702 here.\u0027 `He\u0027s all yours from now on. Stick to him. Out.\u0027 Lewis looked stunned. `What the -\u0027 Graves pointed to the figure of the man going back into the hotel. `Follow that man and see where he goes. His name is Timothy Drew.\u0027 HOUR 8 SAN DIEGO 9 AM PDT `Hold out your hands.\u0027 Peters held out his hands and waited while the supervisor ran the Geiger counter over them. It made a soft clicking sound in the cavernous warehouse garage. `Stand still.\u0027 He stood and watched as the counter probe was passed over his chest, his abdomen, his legs. It was a little like being frisked. `Turn around.\u0027 He turned. He heard the counter clicking as it was passed down his spine to his feet. `Okay. Next.\u0027 Peters stepped aside, and the driver moved forward. As the driver was being checked by the Geiger counter, the dispatcher said to Peters, `First run?\u0027 `Yes,\u0027 Peters said. `Ever done a DC before?\u0027 Peters pointed to the counter. `Not like this.\u0027 `What\u0027ve you done, explosives?\u0027 `Yes.\u0027 `This is easier than explosives or flammables,\u0027 the dispatcher said. `We\u0027ve got a regulation for two men in the cab, and another for staying under forty-five miles an hour. That\u0027s it. We can take all the roads, all the tunnels and bridges. Much easier than explosives.\u0027 Peters nodded. `What exactly is it?\u0027 The dispatcher consulted his clipboard. `Mostly hospital supplies. Cases of intravenous saline, twelve quarts to the case, thirty cases in all. Cases of pennicillin G, forty-eight ampoules to the case, fifteen cases in all. And two rad cartridges.\u0027 `Rad cartridges?\u0027 `Two bars of plutonium-238 oxide. That\u0027s a radioactive isotope. One thousand grammes each - they\u0027re packed in lead cylinders.\u0027 `That\u0027s our dangerous cargo?\u0027 Peters asked. `You bet,\u0027 the dispatcher said. The driver finished his check and came over to join them. `What was that all about?\u0027 `Insurance,\u0027 the dispatcher said. `You have to be cleared before exposure to the cargo., in order for our coverage to be effective. We should also do a blood test, but we don\u0027t bother.\u0027 He turned to Peters. `Reeves, this is your rider, Peters.
