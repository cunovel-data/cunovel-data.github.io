{"id":74841,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"The film ran out. The screen was white. Phelps turned the room lights back on. `Jesus Christ,\u0027 Graves said. He lit a cigarette and noticed that his hands were shaking. `As I said, that man received five times the minimum lethal dose,\u0027 Nordmann said quietly. `Had he got less, he would still have died - more slowly.\u0027 `How much more slowly?\u0027 `From tests on animals, it may take as long as an hour or two.\u0027 `That same progression?\u0027 `The very same.\u0027 `Jesus Christ,\u0027 Graves said again. He walked back into the living-room, which seemed glaringly bright. Through the windows he could look out over the downtown area of the city. He stood with his back to the television and listened to the familiar voice saying, `My fellow Americans, and my fellow Republicans, we have come to a momentous time for our nation. We face great problems, and we face great challenges. We must act now to -\u0027 The set abruptly clicked off. Graves turned and saw that Phelps had done it. `I hope you understand now,\u0027 Phelps said. \u0027Wright has half a ton of that gas. In the San Diego area there are a million people. Plus some very distinguished visitors. We can\u0027t afford cat-andmouse games any longer.\u0027 `I agree,\u0027 Graves said, staring out at the street below. There were no trees. He wondered why they hadn\u0027t put any trees in downtown San Diego. Trees made a difference. Behind him Phelps picked up the telephone and dialled a number. He said, `Phelps here. I want 702.\u0027 There was a pause. Nordmann came over to stand by Graves and look down at the street. `You know,\u0027 he said, `I told the Army four years ago if they kept transporting this crap all around, it was only a matter of time before somebody -\u0027 `You have?\u0027 Phelps said into the phone. His voice was excited. `Where?\u0027 Graves turned. Phelps was nodding, his head bobbing up and down like a mechanical bird. `Yes, yes... yes... good work. We\u0027ll be there in five minutes.\u0027 He hung up and turned to Graves. `702 followed the limousine back to Wright\u0027s old apartment house. The van split off and went somewhere else, but the limo went back to Avenue B.\u0027 `And?\u0027 `They arrested John Wright as he stepped from his car.\u0027 Graves nodded and tried to feel the same excitement that Phelps so clearly showed. But he still had a nagging sense of defeat, as if he had cheated at the game - or had quit too early. `Come on,\u0027 Phelps said. `You can introduce him to me.\u0027 At the apartment house two men were standing up facing the wall, guarded by the men from car 702. Phelps and Graves hurried over. One of the men was George, the chauffeur. He was muttering something under his breath. Wright was beside him, neatly dressed in his English-cut suit. Graves said, `You can let them turn around now.\u0027 He glanced at Phelps, who had a look of total triumph on his face. George turned and looked at Graves uncomprehendingly. Then Wright turned, and it was Graves who stared. `This isn\u0027t John Wright,\u0027 he said. `What do you mean?\u0027 Phelps demanded. `I\u0027ve never seen this man before,\u0027 Graves said. `He isn\u0027t Wright. I \u0027We checked the wallet,\u0027 one of the 702 men said. `He has his identification -\u0027 `I don\u0027t give a damn about identification,\u0027 Graves said. `This man isn\u0027t John Wright.\u0027 The man in the English suit smirked slightly. `Who the hell is he?\u0027 Phelps said. `That,\u0027 Graves said, `is the least important question we have to answer.\u0027 And he ran for his car. HOUR 3 SAN DIEGO 2 PM PDT `Take it easy,\u0027 Phelps said, grabbing the door handle. Graves took the turn from B onto Third very fast, tyres squealing. `For Christ\u0027s sake.\u0027 `You said it yourself,\u0027 Graves said. `A million people.\u0027 `But we have him, we know the plot, we know how it\u0027s going together -\u0027 `We may not be able to stop it,\u0027 Graves said. `Not stop it? What are you talking about?\u0027 Graves raced down Third, weaving among the traffic. He ran the light at Laurel. Phelps made a gurgling noise. \u0027Wright has been ahead of us all along,\u0027 Graves said. `He must have switched clothes in the airfield hangar and sent somebody else back to San Diego in the limousine. He himself went with the furniture van.\u0027 `Well, if you know where he is now -\u0027 `I know where he is,\u0027 Graves said. `But it may be too late to stop him.\u0027 `How can it be too late?\u0027 Phelps said. Graves didn\u0027t answer. With a squeal of tyres he continued uptown, then turned down the wrong way on Alameda Street. Cars honked at him; he pulled over to the kerb on the wrong side, facing the wrong way, in front of afire hydrant. Phelps didn\u0027t complain. He didn\u0027t have time. Graves was already out of the car and running for the building opposite Wright\u0027s new apartment house. In front of Wright\u0027s building was the furniture van. All the men in the room were clustered around the cameras and binoculars at the window. Graves burst in and said, `Is Wright there?F \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 one of the men said. `We heard he was arrested, but somebody in there sure looks like -\u0027 `Let me see.\u0027 Graves bent over a pair of binoculars. It took only a moment to confirm his worst fears. Wright was there, donning another rubber wet suit. He was pulling rubber loops onto his ankles, his wrists, his waist, and his neck. Of course! Those strips - six strips - protected the seams of his suit from gas. As he watched, Wright put on a full face mask and twisted the valve on the small yellow air tank. The other men in the room cleared out. `What\u0027s he doing?\u0027 Phelps said, watching through another pair of binoculars. Graves looked around Wright\u0027s room. The four sawhorses were still in position. Across them lay two cylinders, each about eight feet long. One was painted black, the other yellow. There were stencilled letters on their sides. As he watched, Wright began connecting hoses from each of the tanks to a central T valve, which joined the hoses into a common outlet. Then he turned his attention to other equipment in the room. `Well, that\u0027s it.\u0027 Phelps said, `Let\u0027s go get him.\u0027 `You\u0027re joking,\u0027 Graves said. `Not at all,\u0027 Phelps said. `We know he\u0027s there, we\u0027ve seen him connect up the hoses so that he can -\u0027 Phelps broke off and stared at Graves. `Exactly,\u0027 Graves said. `But this is terrible!V \u0027It\u0027s not terrible, it\u0027s just a fact,\u0027 Graves said. `There\u0027s no way we can break into that room fast enough to get control before he turns on the valves and releases the gas.\u0027 `If we go in shooting -\u0027 `You risk puncturing the tanks.\u0027 `Well we can\u0027t just sit here and watch.\u0027 Phelps said. Graves lit a cigarette. `At the moment there isn\u0027t much else we can do.\u0027 Phelps set down his binoculars. His face was twisted; the earlier look of triumph was completely gone. `Do you have another cigarette?\u0027 he said. Graves gave him one and then went to the phone. \u0027Morrison here.\u0027 `This is Graves. We\u0027ve found your tanks.\u0027 `Listen, you better tell us -\u0027 `They\u0027re on Alameda Street in San Diego.\u0027 `San Diego!\u0027 `I want you to get me some people from the Navy chemical corps. I don\u0027t care where you find them or what you do to get them, just have them here in an hour. Make sure some of them have gas-protective clothing. And make sure at least one of them knows a hell of a lot about this binary gas.\u0027 Graves gave him the address and hung up. He glanced over at Phelps, who was sitting in a corner. `Has somebody notified the President?\u0027 `The President of the United States,\u0027 Graves said. `I assume so.\u0027 `Let\u0027s not assume,\u0027 Graves said. `Use the other phone.\u0027 And he pointed to a phone near Phelps. Graves started to dial another call. `I don\u0027t know how to get him,\u0027 Phelps said, in a plaintive voice. `Use the prestige of your office,\u0027 Graves said, and turned away. `Dr Nordmann\u0027s office.\u0027 `This is Mr Graves from the State Department. I want to speak to Dr Nordmann.\u0027 `Dr Nordmann had a luncheon conference and is not back yet.\u0027 `When do you expect him?\u0027 `Well, not for several hours. He has a faculty meeting at two thirty to discuss PhD candidates, and -\u0027 `Find him,\u0027 Graves said, `and tell him to call me. Tell him it\u0027s about Binary 75 slash 76. Here\u0027s my number.\u0027 He gave it to the secretary. When he hung up, one of the men at the window said, `Look what he\u0027s doing now.\u0027 Graves peered through the binoculars. He saw that Wright had removed his rubber suit and was now attaching wires to the floor of the room, to the ceiling, to the walls. He plugged the wires into a central metal box the size of a shoe box. `What the hell is that box?\u0027 Graves said. In a corner of the room, Phelps was saying, `Yes, that\u0027s right... That\u0027s what I\u0027m telling you, yes... a half-ton of nerve gas... Of course it\u0027s not a joke...\u0027 Graves saw Wright attach two small mechanical devices to the valves of the two tanks. Then he ran more wires back to the box. Finally he stacked a second metal unit on top of the original box and connected still more wires. Then Wright looked at his watch. `Well, somebody better get through to him,\u0027 Phelps was saying. `Yes, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s hard...\u0027 `What time is it?\u0027 Graves said. `Two forty.\u0027 `The gas is called ZV,\u0027 Phelps was saying. `An Army shipment was stolen in Utah during the early hours this morning. He\u0027s probably already been informed... Well, god damn it, I don\u0027t care if you don\u0027t know anything about it. He does... Yes, it\u0027s here...\u0027 One of the men at the window said, `He must be insane.\u0027 `Of course,\u0027 Graves said. `You\u0027d have to be insane to wipe out a million people and one whole political party. But the fact is that we\u0027ve really been lucky.\u0027 `Lucky?\u0027 `Just see that he gets the message,\u0027 Phelps said. `Sure,\u0027 Graves said. `Those Army shipments have been going on for years. They\u0027re sitting ducks. Anybody with a little money, a little intelligence, and a screw loose somewhere could arrange for a steal. Look: Richard Speck knocked off eight nurses, but he was an incompetent. Charles Whitman was an expert rifleman, and cu that basis could knock off seventeen people. John Wright is highly intelligent and very wealthy. He\u0027s going to go for a million people and one American President. And thanks to the US Army, he has a chance of succeeding.\u0027 `I don\u0027t see how you can blame the Army.\u0027 `You don\u0027t?\u0027 Graves asked. He watched the other apartment through the binoculars. His eyes felt the strain; his vision blurred intermittently, and he swore. Wright appeared to be fooling with the two metal boxes in the centre of the floor. He had been adjusting them for a long time. Graves wasn\u0027t sure what it all meant. It was a control or alarm system of some kind, though - that much was clear. And if it was a control system, it required power. Power. As Graves watched, he had an idea -one possible way to beat the system that Wright was so carefully setting up. A chance, a slim chance... `Do it,\u0027 he whispered, watching Wright. `Do it, do `Do what?\u0027 Phelps asked. He was off the telephone now. Graves did not answer. Wright had finished with the boxes. He turned some dials, made some final adjustments. Then he took the main plug in his hand. `He\u0027s going to do it,\u0027 Graves said. And he plugged it into the wall socket. Very plainly, very clearly, he plugged it into the wall. `He\u0027s done it.\u0027 `Done what?\u0027 Phelps said, angry now. `He\u0027s connected his device to the apartment electricity.\u0027 `So?\u0027 `That\u0027s a mistake,\u0027 Graves said. `He should have used a battery unit.\u0027 `Because we can turn off the electricity in that apartment,\u0027 Graves said. `Remotely.\u0027 `Oh,\u0027 Phelps said. And then he smiled. `That\u0027s good thinking.\u0027 Graves said nothing. His mind raced forward in exhilarating high gear. For the first time all day, he felt that he was not only keeping abreast of Wright but actually moving a few steps ahead. It was a marvellous feeling. `Time?\u0027 `Two fifty-one.\u0027 And then, as he watched, Wright did something very peculiar. He placed a small white box alongside the two other metal boxes. And he closed the windows to the apartment. Then he taped the joints and seams of the windows shut. Then he left. `What the hell does all that mean?\u0027 somebody asked. `I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Graves said. `But I know how we can find out.\u0027 HOUR 2 SAN DIEGO 3 PM PTD Wright emerged from the apartment house lobby wearing a grey suit. He carried a raincoat over his shoulder. Graves was waiting for him, along with two federal marshals carrying drawn guns. Wright did not look surprised. He smiled and said, `Did your son like his gift, Mr Graves?\u0027 Before Graves could reply, one of the marshals had spun Wright around, saying gruffly, `Up against the wall hands wide stand still and you won\u0027t get hurt.\u0027 `Gentlemen,\u0027 Wright said in an offended voice. He looked at Graves over his shoulder. `I don\u0027t think any of this is necessary. Mr Graves knows what he is looking for.\u0027 `Yes, I do,\u0027 Graves said. He had already noticed the raincoat. Nobody carried a raincoat in San Diego in August. It was as out of place as a Bible in a whorehouse. `But I want to know what time it leaves.\u0027 `There\u0027s only one possible flight today,\u0027 Wright said. `Connexions in Miami. Leaves San Diego at four thirty.\u0027 The marshal took Wright\u0027s shoulder wallet and handed it to Graves. The ticket was inside: San Diego to Los Angeles to Miami to Montego Bay, Jamaica. The ticket was made out to Mr A. Johnson. `May I turn around now?\u0027 Wright asked. `Shut up,\u0027 the marshal said. `Let him turn around,\u0027 Graves said. Wright turned, rubbing the grit of the wall from his hands. He smiled at Graves. `Your move.\u0027 In the smile and the slight nod of the head, Graves got a chilling sense of the profound insanity of the man. The eyes gave it away. Wright\u0027s eyes were genuinely amused: a clever chess player teasing an inferior opponent. But this wasn\u0027t chess, not really. Not with stakes like these. Death in 1.7 minutes, Graves thought, and he had a mental image of the prisoner twisting and writhing on the floor, liquid running from his nose in a continuous stream, vomit spewing out. Graves realized then that he had mistaken his opponent for too long. Wright was insane. He was capable of anything. It produced a churning sensation in Graves\u0027 stomach. `Tape him inside,\u0027 Graves said to the marshal. `I want to talk to him.\u0027 The three of them sat in the lobby of the apartment building. It was the kind of lobby that aspired to look like the grossest Miami Beach hotels; there were plastic palms in plastic pots and fake Louis XIV furniture which, apparently out of fear that someone would want to steal it, was bolted to the imitation marble floor. Under other circumstances the artificiality of the surroundings would have annoyed Graves, but now it somehow seemed appropriate. By implication the room suggested that falsehoods were acceptable, even preferable, to the truth.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/binary/page-11.html","bookId":2408,"book":{"id":2408,"title":"Binary","description":"Storyline: Binary (Hard Case Crime MC8) by John Lange, Michael Crichton Political radical John Wright is plotting an act of mass destruction – and federal agent John Graves has him under surveillance, trying to figure out what the plot is.
