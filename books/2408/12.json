{"id":74842,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Graves sat in a chair facing Wright. The marshal sat diagonally facing both of them and the only exit. The marshal held his gun loosely in his lap.\\n\\n Wright looked at the marshal and the position of the gun. `That\u0027s what it\u0027s all about,\u0027 he said, and smiled again. That insane smile.\\n\\n `How do you mean?\u0027 Graves said.\\n\\n Wright sighed patiently. `Do I confuse you?\u0027\\n\\n `Of course. That was your intention.\u0027\\n\\n `I doubt that I\u0027ve confused you much,\u0027 Wright said.\\n\\n `You\u0027ve really done very well, Mr Graves. May I call you John?\u0027\\n\\n The condescending tone was unmistakable, but Graves merely shrugged. He glanced at his watch: 3:05.\\n\\n `Very well, indeed,\u0027 Wright continued. `For the last month or so, John, I\u0027ve had the feeling that you were a worthy adversary. I can\u0027t tell you how reassuring that was.\u0027\\n\\n `Reassuring?\u0027\\n\\n `I prefer to do things well,\u0027 he said. He took a slim cigar from a gunmetal case and lit it. `I mean elegantly, with a certain finesse. In a situation like this, one needs a proper opponent. I was immensely reassured that my opponent was you, John.\u0027 Wright sighed. `Of course, I have another opponent as well,\u0027 he said. `One totally lacking in finesse, elegance, and grace. The sad thing is, he thinks he\u0027s a statesman.\u0027\\n\\n `You mean the President?\u0027\\n\\n `I prefer to think of him,\u0027 Wright said, `as that man who rode the bench for so many years. Why did he ride the bench? Did you ever think of that? The answer is simple enough - because he wasn\u0027t a good player. He was inept. He was incompetent. He was a bumbling fool.\u0027\\n\\n `You feel strongly about him.\u0027\\n\\n `I feel strongly about his policies.\u0027\\n\\n `China?\u0027\\n\\n `Ten years ago,\u0027 Wright said, `if I asked you the name of the American President most likely to institute wage and price controls, welfare reform, and diplomatic relations with Communist China, would you have ever thought of this man? It\u0027s insane, what he\u0027s doing.\u0027\\n\\n `What about what you\u0027re doing?\u0027\\n\\n `Somebody has to stop him,\u0027 Wright said. `It\u0027s as simple as that.\u0027\\n\\n `I wouldn\u0027t call nerve gas a democratic method.\u0027\\n\\n Graves stared at him. `What are those metal boxes in the centre of the floor upstairs?\u0027\\n\\n Wright smiled. `Enough politics, eh?\u0027 He puffed on his cigar, billowing light. smoke. `Very well. Down to business.\u0027 A thought seemed to occur to him. `But if I tell you, how will you know it\u0027s the truth?\u0027\\n\\n `That\u0027s my job.\u0027\\n\\n `True, true. There are actually three boxes, as I\u0027m sure you observed from your surveillance station across the street. I had to get an extension cord in order to place the boxes in clear view of the window.\u0027\\n\\n `Very thoughtful.\u0027\\n\\n `I felt you\u0027d appreciate it,\u0027 Wright said. `The first box is a timer. It controls a rather intricate set of staging sequences for the equipment in the room.\u0027\\n\\n Graves took out a cigarette. His hands shook slightly as he lit it. He hoped Wright wouldn\u0027t notice - but that, of course, was wishful thinking. Wright would notice.\\n\\n But Wright didn\u0027t comment on it. `The second box,\u0027 he said, `is an impedance and vibration sensor. There are contact points located around the room. On the door, on the floor, on the walls. Any excessive vibration - for example, a man walking on the floor of the room - will set off the gas. It\u0027s a commercial unit. I bought it last week.\u0027 He smiled then. `A friend made the purchase, so that you wouldn\u0027t be aware of it.\u0027\\n\\n `The third box?\u0027\\n\\n `The third box is the little white unit alongside the other boxes. It\u0027s a battery. We wouldn\u0027t want to be dependent on electricity in the apartment, after all. You could turn that off remotely.\u0027\\n\\n Graves had a sinking feeling, and it must have showed, because Wright laughed. `Oh, you were planning to do that, were you?\u0027 He shook his head. `Too simple. Much too simple. I wouldn\u0027t make a mistake like that.\u0027\\n\\n `What\u0027s the voltage of the batteries?\u0027 Graves snapped, trying to regain control of the situation.\\n\\n `A very intelligent question,\u0027 Wright said. `I am tempted to lie, but I won\u0027t. It is a twelve-volt unit.\u0027\\n\\n `Amperage?\u0027\\n\\n `I haven\u0027t the faintest idea.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t concern you?\u0027\\n\\n `The amperage is adequate.\u0027\\n\\n `Adequate for what?\u0027\\n\\n Wright smiled. `Really,\u0027 he said, `you don\u0027t expect me to hand you everything on a silver platter.\u0027\\n\\n `Actually, I do.\u0027\\n\\n `Then you\u0027re being naive. How do you expect to extract information from me?\u0027 He glanced at his watch. `There is not a lot of time, and although I am sure you could torture me inventively, you couldn\u0027t get me to talk. Not fast enough.\u0027\\n\\n `Why did you close the apartment windows?\u0027\\n\\n Wright smiled. `Fascinating. I was wondering if you\u0027d catch that. I taped them, too.\u0027\\n\\n `Yes, you did.\u0027\\n\\n `I closed the windows,\u0027 Wright said, `because the mechanism in that room anticipates some action you will take.\u0027\\n\\n `Some action I will take?\u0027\\n\\n `Yes.\u0027\\n\\n `You\u0027re being cryptic.\u0027\\n\\n `I can afford to be cryptic.\u0027\\n\\n `What\u0027s the point of the scintillation counter?\u0027\\n\\n `An interesting problem, but not so interesting as the explosives.\u0027\\n\\n Graves tried to keep his face blank, but it didn\u0027t work.\\n\\n `Ah,\u0027 Wright said. `You don\u0027t know about the explosives? There was a robbery of twenty pounds of plastic explosive - Compound C, I believe it\u0027s called - earlier today, on the freeway. A hijacked truck. I\u0027m surprised you haven\u0027t already been informed.\u0027\\n\\n Graves was beginning to sweat. He resisted the impulse to wipe his forehead. He sat back in his chair and tried to be calm.\\n\\n `You seem nervous,\u0027 Wright said.\\n\\n `Concerned.\u0027\\n\\n `There is no need to be nervous,\u0027 Wright said. `I can assure you right now, it is impossible for you to get into that room alive. I don\u0027t advise you to try.\u0027\\n\\n `You seem quite nonchalant.\u0027\\n\\n `Oh, I am.\u0027 He turned the cigar in his mouth, removed it, stared at the burning tip.\\n\\n `We can hold you, of course.\u0027\\n\\n `You mean, prevent me from leaving San Diego?\u0027\\n\\n `Yes.\u0027\\n\\n `I\u0027d expect that.\u0027\\n\\n `You don\u0027t care?\u0027\\n\\n `Not particularly.\u0027\\n\\n `But you\u0027ll die,\u0027 Graves said.\\n\\n `A great many people will die, in fact,\u0027 Wright said, and his eyes glowed with a sudden mad intensity. `You may have noticed that weather conditions are perfect. There is an inversion layer over the city. Any released gases will be blown west - across the city -and will be trapped there. Do you know much about meteorology?\u0027\\n\\n `A little.\u0027\\n\\n `You know,\u0027 Wright said, `it\u0027s a funny thing about chemical agents. The military makes them, but they don\u0027t have much military use. By their very nature, they work best in high population density situations. And that means civilian populations. That\u0027s where you get the most bangs for your buck, so to speak.\u0027\\n\\n His eyes literally sparkled as he talked. `But the irony goes even farther,\u0027 he said. `Modern city life improves the effectiveness of these weapons. You can imagine a city like San Diego as existing with a giant plastic dome over it. That\u0027s the inversion layer. It blankets the area, holds in all the automobile fumes and exhaust gases that make city air so obnoxious.\\n\\n That inversion layer will hold any released gas - or, in the case of ZV, oil droplet suspension.\u0027\\n\\n Graves snapped his fingers. `The detergent!\u0027\\n\\n `Yes,\u0027 Wright said. `Good for you. The detergent was ordered in case I had an accident in the hangar. Have to cut that oil somehow. Detergent was the best way. But,\u0027 he said, `I didn\u0027t have an accident. Nothing went wrong.\u0027\\n\\n At that moment Phelps stuck his head in the door. `Nordmann\u0027s here.\u0027\\n\\n `All right,\u0027 Graves said.\\n\\n Wright looked appreciative. `Good move,\u0027 he said. `Nordmann\u0027s an excellent man. In fact, it was one of his articles - detailed, scholarly, and complete - that suggested to me the possibility of stealing some gas in the first place.\u0027\\n\\n Again there was that glow in Wright\u0027s eyes. Graves found himself getting angry. He stood up abruptly. `Don\u0027t let him go anywhere,\u0027 he said 2o the marshal.\\n\\n `I wouldn\u0027t think of it, until I\u0027ve finished my cigar,\u0027 Wright said.\\n\\n Graves left the lobby.\\n\\n Nordmann was outside, standing on the sidewalk with Phelps. They were both looking up, talking.\\n\\n Graves said, `The gas is up there. Is there any antidote?\u0027\\n\\n `To ZV? Nothing very good.\u0027\\n\\n `But there is an antidote?\u0027\\n\\n `There\u0027s a sort of theoretical antidote. If a person has a mild exposure, it may be possible to inject chemicals to block the effects of the gas.\u0027\\n\\n `Can you get those chemicals?\u0027\\n\\n `Yes, but not in sufficient quantities to protect very many -\u0027\\n\\n `Get as much as you can,\u0027 Graves said. `Do it immediately.\u0027 He turned to Phelps. `Notify the San Diego\\n\\n police. Evacuate this block and cordon it off. Cordon off the blocks on both sides as well. And I mean a cordon - nobody in and nobody out.\u0027 He paused. `What happened with the President?\u0027\\n\\n `He\u0027s leaving within the hour.\u0027\\n\\n `For sure?\u0027\\n\\n `I assume so.\u0027\\n\\n `Better check again.\u0027\\n\\n Phelps nodded towards the lobby. `Is he talking?\u0027\\n\\n `He\u0027s saying what he wants to say,\u0027 Graves said.\\n\\n `My God, he\u0027s a cool customer.\u0027\\n\\n `What did you expect?\u0027 Graves said, and went back inside.\\n\\n When he returned, he found the marshal smoking one of Wright\u0027s slim cigars. Graves shot him a look; the marshal quickly stubbed it out.\\n\\n `Waste of a good cigar,\u0027 Wright said. `Why can\u0027t we all be friends?\u0027\\n\\n Graves sat down. `What did you paint in the hangar?\u0027 `Paint? amp;\\n\\n \u0027Yes. We found a spray gun and several cans of paint.\u0027\\n\\n `Oh, that.\u0027\\n\\n `What did you paint?\u0027\\n\\n `I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ll answer that.\u0027\\n\\n `What did you paint?\u0027\\n\\n `You show a certain redundancy of mind,\u0027 Wright said. `It\u0027s tiresome, and disappointing. I expected you to be more clever.\u0027 He was silent a moment. `I will tell you one thing,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n `What\u0027s that?\u0027 Graves resented the eagerness that he heard in his own voice.\\n\\n `I have devised a multiple staging system. Actually, several interlocking systems. If one fails or is thwarted, another takes over. It\u0027s quite beyond you, I can assure you of that. However, I will tell you I am dependent on one external system, which is fortunately quite reliable.\u0027\\n\\n `What\u0027s that?\u0027\\n\\n `You,\u0027 Wright said. `Everything has been designed especially for you, so to speak.\u0027\\n\\n Wright\u0027s calmness was infuriating. Graves bit his lip, trying to control his anger.\\n\\n `What time is it?\u0027 Wright asked.\\n\\n `Three forty,\u0027 the marshal said.\\n\\n `Thank you. Do you have any other questions, John?\u0027\\n\\n `One or two,\u0027 Graves said. His anger was so intense that it clouded his judgement. He fought the feeling.\\n\\n `I can see you\u0027re upset,\u0027 Wright said. `And you haven\u0027t asked me some rather obvious questions. One is, when will the gas go off?\u0027\\n\\n Graves stared at him, almost shaking with fury.\\n\\n `The answer,\u0027 Wright said, `is five PM exactly. The gas will go off then. It will begin to drift in a predictable way and will have blanketed the city with good saturation by about five thirty, the peak of the rush hour: maximum number of people on the streets, and so on. Now, it seems to me there was something else I wanted to tell you...\u0027\\n\\n Graves wanted to beat the man to a pulp. He wanted to smash his face, to shatter his nose, his teeth... He had a brief image of himself standing over Wright, pounding him.\\n\\n `Damn,\u0027 Wright said, `it was just on the tip of my tongue. Well, no matter. It couldn\u0027t have been that important.\u0027 He sighed. `I think,\u0027 he said, `this concludes the questions for today. I have nothing else to say.\u0027\\n\\n Graves stared at him for a moment. `You don\u0027t leave us much choice.\u0027\\n\\n Wright smiled. `I believe you call it \"softening up\"; is that right?\u0027\\n\\n `More or less.\u0027\\n\\n `An interesting notion,\u0027 Wright said, `but now I must leave.\u0027\\n\\n And with astonishing speed he jumped from his chair and raced for the door. The marshal crouched down and held his gun stiffly.\\n\\n `Don\u0027t!\u0027 Graves shouted, and knocked the pistol away. The marshal looked stunnL d. `Don\u0027t shoot him!\u0027\\n\\n Wright was out the door. A second marshal stood outside. He wore a look of surprise as Wright slammed him in the groin with one knee. He doubled over. Wright sprinted for the stairs to the basement.\\n\\n `He\u0027s going for the garage,\u0027 Graves said. He pushed the other marshal towards the door to the basement and then ran outside.\\n\\n Phelps was directing a half-dozen marshals and policemen to cordon off the area.\\n\\n \u0027Wright\u0027s escaped!\u0027 Graves shouted. He ran down the street, looking for the underground garage exit.\\n\\n `Where?\u0027\\n\\n `The garage.\u0027\\n\\n `Can he get out?\u0027\\n\\n The marshals and police all drew their guns. A single shot echoed inside the garage.\\n\\n `How did this happen?\u0027 Phelps demanded.\\n\\n Graves looked at the marshals and the cops standing by the ramp from the garage. `Don\u0027t shoot him,\u0027 he said. `Whatever happens, don\u0027t shoot him.\u0027\\n\\n There was a long silence. Nothing further was heard from inside the garage.\\n\\n `I demand to know what happened,\u0027 Phelps said.\\n\\n Graves listened.\\n\\n Nothing.\\n\\n The cops looked at each other.\\n\\n `Hey,\u0027 a cop shouted, from the garage. `He went out the other exit!\u0027\\n\\n Graves instantly realized that he had made a mistake. Wright was too smart to think he could escape from the garage of this building; he would have another plan. Graves started to run. So did the police.\\n\\n `Where\u0027d he go?\u0027\\n\\n `Next building. Other block.\u0027\\n\\n Graves sprinted down the ramp into the garage and towards the other garage exit. He ran up a short flight of stairs through an open door and came out into an alley. The alley connected with the opposite block. He ran down it, the cops following, their footsteps echoing.\\n\\n They saw no one.\\n\\n `Where\u0027d he go?\u0027\\n\\n Graves held up his hand. Everyone paused. They heard the sound of an engine. It was coming from the garage of a building on the adjacent block.\\n\\n `Where\u0027s the exit from that garage?\u0027\\n\\n Graves ran forward. The exit must be on the street. They came out into the next street - deserted, heavily cordoned off at each end, with a police car crosswise blocking the road, cops standing around.\\n\\n The sound of a racing engine. They saw a ramp.\\n\\n `Don\u0027t sh -\u0027\\n\\n Wright\u0027s Alfa came up the ramp, moving very fast. The cops and marshals scrambled out of the way. They fired as they ran.\\n\\n Graves felt sick.\\n\\n But the Alfa was still going. It made a twisting righthand turn, slamming into a parked car. There were more gunshots. The side windows shattered into great spiderwebs, but somehow the car continued, gears grinding as it raced down the street.\\n\\n Wright had planned it well, Graves thought. He would have made his escape by sneaking through the buildings if it hadn\u0027t been for the roadblock. He didn\u0027t expect that; Graves himself had ordered it on the spur of the moment. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/binary/page-12.html","bookId":2408,"book":{"id":2408,"title":"Binary","description":"Storyline: Binary (Hard Case Crime MC8) \\n by John Lange, Michael Crichton \\n Political radical John Wright is plotting an act of mass destruction – and federal agent John Graves has him under surveillance, trying to figure out what the plot is. \\n When a government computer is hacked and a high-security shipment of nerve gas gets hijacked, Graves puts the pieces together – but can he stop Wright from unleashing his weapon before it kills a million people ... including the President of the United States?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/binary.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/binary.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:46 AM"}}
