{"id":33407,"no":21,"title":"Chapter Twenty Black on Pink","content":"Bond whirled round. He looked over to the bed, but his eyes were blind from gazing at the moon. He crossed the room and turned on the pink-shaded light by the bed. There was a long body under the single sheet. Brown hair was spread out on the pillow. The tips of fingers showed, holding the sheet up over the face. Lower down the breasts stood up like hills under snow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond laughed shortly. He leaned forward and gave the hair a soft tug. There was a squeak of protest from under the sheet. Bond sat down on the edge of the bed. After a moment\u0027s silence a corner of the sheet was cautiously lowered and one large blue eye inspected him. \\n\\n \\n\\n `You look very improper.\u0027 The voice was muffled by the sheet. \\n\\n \\n\\n `What about you! And how did you get here?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `I walked down two floors. I live here too.\u0027 The voice was deep and provocative. There was very little accent. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Well, I\u0027m going to get into bed.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The sheet came quickly down to the chin and the girl pulled herself up on the pillows. She was blushing. `Oh no. You mustn\u0027t.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `But it\u0027s my bed. And anyway you told me to.\u0027 The face was incredibly beautiful. Bond examined it coolly. The blush deepened.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `That was only a phrase. To introduce myself.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Well I\u0027m very glad to meet you. My name\u0027s James Bond.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Mine\u0027s Tatiana Romanova.\u0027 She sounded the second A of Tatiana and the first A of Romanova very long. `My friends call me Tania.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a pause while they looked at each other, the girl with curiosity, and with what might have been relief. Bond with cool surmise. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was the first to break the silence. `You look just like your photographs,\u0027 she blushed again. `But you must put something on. It upsets me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `You upset me just as much. That\u0027s called sex. If I got into bed with you it wouldn\u0027t matter. Anyway, what have you got on?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She pulled the sheet a fraction lower to show a quarter-inch black velvet ribbon round her neck. `This.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond looked down into the teasing blue eyes, now wide as if asking if the ribbon was inadequate. He felt his body getting out of control. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Damn you, Tania. Where are the rest of your things? Or did you come down in the lift like that?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Oh no. That would not have been kulturny. They are under the bed.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Well, if you think you are going to get out of this room without . . .\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond left the sentence unfinished. He got up from the bed and went to put on one of the dark blue silk pyjama coats he wore instead of pyjamas. \\n\\n \\n\\n `What you are suggesting is not kulturny.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Oh isn\u0027t it,\u0027 said Bond sarcastically. He came back to the bed and pulled up a chair beside it. He smiled down at her. `Well I\u0027ll tell you something kulturny. You\u0027re one of the most beautiful women in the world.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The girl blushed again. She looked at him seriously. `Are you speaking the truth? I think my mouth is too big. Am I as beautiful as Western girls? I was once told I look like Greta Garbo. Is that so?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `More beautiful,\u0027 said Bond. `There is more light in your face. And your mouth isn\u0027t too big. It\u0027s just the right size. For me, anyway.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `What is that-``light in the face\u0027\u0027? What do you mean?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond meant that she didn\u0027t look to him like a Russian spy. She seemed to show none of the reserve of a spy. None of the coldness, none of the calculation. She gave the impression of warmth of heart and gaiety. These things shone out through the eyes. He searched for a non-committal phrase. `There is a lot of gaiety and fun in your eyes,\u0027 he said lamely. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tatiana looked serious. `That is curious,\u0027 she said. `There is not much fun and gaiety in Russia. No one speaks of these things. I have never been told that before.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Gaiety? she thought, after the last two months? How could she be looking gay? And yet, yes, there was a lightness in her heart. Was she a loose woman by nature? Or was it something to do with this man she had never seen before? Relief about him after the agony of thinking about what she had to do? It was certainly much easier than she had expected. He made it easy-made it fun, with a spice of danger. He was terribly handsome. And he looked very clean. Would he forgive her when they got to London and she told him? Told him that she had been sent to seduce him? Even the night on which she must do it and the number of the room? Surely he wouldn\u0027t mind very much. It was doing him no harm. It was only a way for her to get to England and make those reports. `Gaiety and fun in her eyes.\u0027 Well, why not? It was possible. There was a wonderful sense of freedom being alone with a man like this and knowing that she would not be punished for it. It was really terribly exciting. \\n\\n \\n\\n `You are very handsome,\u0027 she said. She searched for a comparison that would give him pleasure. `You are like an American film star.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She was startled by his reaction. `For God\u0027s sake! That\u0027s the worst insult you can pay a man!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She hurried to make good her mistake. How curious that the compliment didn\u0027t please him. Didn\u0027t everyone in the West want to look like a film star? `I was lying,\u0027 she said. `I wanted to give you pleasure. In fact you are like my favourite hero. He\u0027s in a book by a Russian called Lermontov. I will tell you about him one day.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n One day ? Bond thought it was time to get down to business. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Now listen, Tania.\u0027 He tried not to look at the beautiful face on the pillow. He fixed his eyes on the point of her chin. `We\u0027ve got to stop fooling and be serious. What is all this about? Are you really going to come back to England with me?\u0027 He raised his eyes to hers. It was fatal. She had opened them wide again in that damnable guilelessness. \\n\\n \\n\\n `But of course!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Oh!\u0027 Bond was taken aback by the directness of her answer. He looked at her suspiciously. `You\u0027re sure?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Yes.\u0027 Her eyes were truthful now. She had stopped flirting. \\n\\n \\n\\n `You\u0027re not afraid?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He saw a shadow cross her eyes. But it was not what he thought. She had remembered that she had a part to play. She was to be frightened of what she was doing. Terrified. It had sounded so easy, this acting, but now it was difficult. How odd! She decided to compromise. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Yes. I am afraid. But not so much now. You will protect me. I thought you would.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Well, yes, of course I will.\u0027 Bond thought of her relatives in Russia. He quickly put the thought out of his mind. What was he doing? Trying to dissuade her from coming? He closed his mind to the consequences he imagined for her. `There\u0027s nothing to worry about. I\u0027ll look after you.\u0027 And now for the question he had been shirking. He felt a ridiculous embarrassment. This girl wasn\u0027t in the least what he had expected. It was spoiling everything to ask the question. It had to be done. \\n\\n \\n\\n `What about the machine?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Yes. It was as if he had cuffed her across the face. Pain showed in her eyes, and the edge of tears. \\n\\n \\n\\n She pulled the sheet over her mouth and spoke from behind it. Her eyes above the sheet were cold. \\n\\n \\n\\n `So that\u0027s what you want.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Now listen.\u0027 Bond put nonchalance in his voice. `This machine\u0027s got nothing to do with you and me. But my people in London want it.\u0027 He remembered security. He added blandly. `It\u0027s not all that important. They know all about the machine and they think it\u0027s a wonderful Russian invention. They just want one to copy. Like your people copy foreign cameras and things.\u0027 God, how lame it sounded! \\n\\n \\n\\n `Now you\u0027re lying.\u0027 A big tear rolled out of one wide blue eye and down the soft cheek and on to the pillow. She pulled the sheet up over her eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond reached out and put his hand on her arm under the sheet. The arm flinched angrily away. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Damn the bloody machine,\u0027 he said impatiently. `But for God\u0027s sake, Tania, you must know that I\u0027ve got a job to do. Just say one way or the other and we\u0027ll forget about it. There are lots more things to talk about. \\n\\n \\n\\n We\u0027ve got to arrange our journey and so on. Of course my people want it or they wouldn\u0027t have sent me out to bring you home with it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Tatiana dabbed her eyes with the sheet. Brusquely she pulled the sheet down to her shoulders again. She knew that she had been forgetting her job. It had just been that. . . Oh well. If only he had said that the machine didn\u0027t matter to him so long as she would come. But that was too much to hope for. He was right. He had a job to do. So had she. \\n\\n \\n\\n She looked up at him calmly. `I will bring it. Have no fear. But do not let us mention it again. And now listen.\u0027 She sat up straighter on the pillows. `We must go tonight.\u0027 She remembered her lesson. `It is the only chance. This evening I am on duty from six o\u0027clock. I shall be alone in the office and I will take the Spektor.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond\u0027s eyes narrowed. His mind raced as he thought of the problems that would have to be faced. Where to hide her. How to get her out to the first plane after the loss had been discovered. It was going to be a risky business. They would stop at nothing to get her and the Spektor back. Roadblock on the way to the airport. Bomb in the plane. Anything. \\n\\n \\n\\n `That\u0027s wonderful, Tania.\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was casual. `We\u0027ll keep you hidden and then we\u0027ll take the first plane tomorrow morning.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Don\u0027t be foolish.\u0027 Tatiana had been warned that here would be some difficult lines in her part. `We will take the train. This Orient Express. It leaves at nine tonight. Do you think I haven\u0027t been thinking this thing out? I won\u0027t stay a minute longer in Istanbul than I have to. We will be over the frontier at dawn. You must get the tickets and a passport. I will travel with you as your wife.\u0027 She looked happily up at him. `I shall like that. In one of those coupes I have read about. They must be very comfortable. Like a tiny house on wheels. During the day we will talk and read and at night you will stand in the corridor outside our house and guard it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Like hell I will,\u0027 said Bond. `But look here, Tania. That\u0027s crazy. They\u0027re bound to catch up with us somewhere. It\u0027s four days and five nights to London on that train. We\u0027ve got to think of something else.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `I won\u0027t,\u0027 said the girl flatly. `That\u0027s the only way I\u0027ll go. If you are clever, how can they find out?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Oh God, she thought. Why had they insisted on this train? But they had been definite. It was a good place for love, they had said. She would have four days to get him to love her. Then, when they got to London, life would be easy for her. He would protect her. Otherwise, if they flew to London, she would be put straight into prison. The four days were essential. And, they had warned her, we will have men on the train to see you don\u0027t get off. So be careful and obey your orders. Oh God. Oh God. Yet now she longed for those four days with him in the little house on wheels. How curious! It had been her duty to force him. Now it was her passionate desire. \\n\\n \\n\\n She watched Bond\u0027s thoughtful face. She longed to stretch out a hand to him and reassure him that it would be all right; that this was a harmless konspiratsia to get her to England: that no harm could come to either of them, because that was not the object of the plot. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Well, I still think it\u0027s crazy,\u0027 said Bond, wondering what M\u0027s reaction would be. `But I suppose it may work. I\u0027ve got the passport. It will need a Yugoslav visa,\u0027 he looked at her sternly. `Don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to take you on the part of the train that goes through Bulgaria, or I shall think you want to kidnap me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `I do,\u0027 Tatiana giggled. `That\u0027s exactly what I want to do.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Now shut up, Tania. We\u0027ve got to work this out. I\u0027ll get the tickets and I\u0027ll have one of our men come along. Just in case. He\u0027s a good man. You\u0027ll like him. Your name\u0027s Caroline Somerset. Don\u0027t forget it. How are you going to get to the train!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Karolin Siomerset,\u0027 the girl turned the name over in her mind. `It is a pretty name. And you are Mister Siomerset.\u0027 She laughed happily. `That is fun. Do not worry about me. I will come to the train just before it leaves. It is the Sirkeci Station. I know where it is. So that is all. And we do not worry any more. Yes?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Suppose you lose your nerve? Suppose they catch you?\u0027 Suddenly Bond was worried at the girl\u0027s confidence. How could she be so certain? A sharp tingle of suspicion ran down his spine. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Before I saw you, I was frightened. Now I am not.\u0027 Tatiana tried to tell herself that this was the truth. Somehow it nearly was. `Now I shall not lose my nerve, as you call it. And they cannot catch me. I shall leave my things in the hotel and take my usual bag to the office. I cannot leave my fur coat behind. I love it too dearly. But today is Sunday and that will be an excuse to come to the office in it. Tonight at half-past eight I shall walk out and take a taxi to the station. And now you must stop looking so worried.\u0027 Impulsively, because she had to, she stretched out a hand towards him. `Say that you are pleased.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond moved to the edge of the bed. He took her hand and looked down into her eyes. God, he thought. I hope it\u0027s all right. I hope this crazy plan will work. Is this wonderful girl a cheat? Is she true? Is she real? The eyes told him nothing except that the girl was happy, and that she wanted him to love her, and that she was surprised at what was happening to her. Tatiana\u0027s other hand came up and round his neck and pulled him fiercely down to her. At first the mouth trembled under his and then, as passion took her, the mouth yielded into a kiss without end. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond lifted his legs on to the bed. While his mouth went on kissing her, his hand went to her left breast and held it, feeling the peak hard with desire under his fingers. His hand strayed on down across her flat stomach. Her legs shifted languidly. She moaned softly and her mouth slid away from his. Below the closed eyes the long lashes quivered like humming birds\u0027 wings. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond reached up and took the edge of the sheet and pulled it right down and threw it off the end of the huge bed. She was wearing nothing but the black ribbon round her neck and black silk stockings rolled above her knees. Her arms groped up for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Above them, and unknown to both of them, behind the gold-framed false mirror on the wall over the bed, the two photographers from SMERSH sat close together in the cramped cabinet de voyeur, as, before them, so many friends of the proprietor had sat on a honeymoon night in the stateroom of the Kristal Palas. \\n\\n \\n\\n And the view-finders gazed coldly down on the passionate arabesques the two bodies formed and broke and formed again, and the clockwork mechanism of the cine-cameras whirred softly on and on as the breath rasped out of the open mouths of the two men and the sweat of excitement trickled down their bulging faces into their cheap collars. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563/46368.html","bookId":1277,"book":{"id":1277,"title":"007之俄罗斯之恋 From Russia With Love","description":"简介： 雷迪是魔鬼党的头号杀手，一直从未失手。由于007屡次破坏魔鬼党的好事，魔鬼党决心除掉他，于是放出情报说英国军方一直渴望得到的密码机在俄国。同时，俄国女郎塔迪娜向英国军方提出要求，只要他们协助她逃往西方，即可奉上密码机。英国军方于是派出007前往俄国接应塔迪...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/23/14-58-16-50-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
