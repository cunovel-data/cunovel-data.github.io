{"id":33399,"no":13,"title":"Chapter Twelve A Piece of Cake","content":"As it turned out, Bond never had to make a decision on the Committee\u0027s final report. He had complimented his secretary on a new summer frock, and was half way through the file of signals that had come in during the night, when the red telephone that could only mean M or his Chief-of-Staff gave its soft, peremptory burr. Bond picked up the receiver. `007.\u0027 `Can you come up?\u0027 It was the Chief-of-Staff. `M?\u0027 `Yes. And it looks like a long session. I\u0027ve told Troop you won\u0027t be able to make the Committee.\u0027 `Any idea what it\u0027s about?\u0027 The Chief-of-Staff chuckled. `Well, I have as a matter of fact. But you\u0027d better hear about it from him. It\u0027ll make you sit up. There\u0027s quite a swerve on this one.\u0027 As Bond put on his coat and went out into the corridor, banging the door behind him he had a feeling of certainty that the starter\u0027s gun had fired and that the dog days had come to an end. Even the ride up to the top floor in the lift and the walk down the long quiet corridor to the door of M\u0027s small office seemed to be charged with the significance of all those other occasions when the bell of the red telephone had been the signal that had fired him, like a loaded projectile, across the world towards some distant target of M\u0027s choosing. And the eyes of Miss Moneypenny, M\u0027s private secretary, had that old look of excitement and secret knowledge as she smiled up at him and pressed the switch on the intercom. `007\u0027s here, sir.\u0027 `Send him in,\u0027 said the metallic voice, and the red light of privacy went on above the door. Bond went through the door and closed it softly behind him. The room was cool, or perhaps it was the Venetian blinds that gave an impression of coolness. They threw bars of light and shadow across the dark green carpet up to the edge of the big central desk. There the sunshine stopped so that the quiet figure behind the desk sat in a pool of suffused greenish shade. In the ceiling directly above the desk, a big twin-bladed tropical fan, a recent addition to M\u0027s room, slowly revolved, shifting the thundery August air that, even high up above the Regent\u0027s Park, was heavy and stale after a week of heat-wave. M gestured to the chair opposite him across the red leather desk. Bond sat down and looked across into the tranquil, lined sailor\u0027s face that he loved, honoured and obeyed. `Do you mind if I ask you a personal question, James?\u0027 M never asked his staff personal questions and Bond couldn\u0027t imagine what was coming. `No, sir.\u0027 M picked his pipe out of the big copper ash-tray and began to fill it, thoughtfully watching his fingers at work with the tobacco. He said harshly: `You needn\u0027t answer, but it\u0027s to do with your, er, friend, Miss Case. As you know, I don\u0027t generally interest myself in these matters, but I did hear that you had been, er, seeing a lot of each other since that diamond business. Even some idea you might be going to get married.\u0027 M glanced up at Bond and then down again. He put the loaded pipe into his mouth and set a match to it. Out of the corner of his mouth, as he drew at the jigging flame, he said: `Care to tell me anything about it?\u0027 Now what? wondered Bond. Damn these office gossips. He said gruffly, `Well, sir, we did get on well. And there was some idea we might get married. But then she met some chap in the American Embassy. On the Military Attaché\u0027s staff. Marine Corps major. And I gather she\u0027s going to marry him. They\u0027ve both gone back to the States, as a matter of fact. Probably better that way. Mixed marriages aren\u0027t often a success. I gather he\u0027s a nice enough fellow. Probably suit her better than living in London. She couldn\u0027t really settle down here. Fine girl, but she\u0027s a bit neurotic. We had too many rows. Probably my fault. Anyway it\u0027s over now.\u0027 M gave one of the brief smiles that lit up his eyes more than his mouth. `I\u0027m sorry if it went wrong, James,\u0027 he said. There was no sympathy in M\u0027s voice. He disapproved of Bond\u0027s `womanizing\u0027, as he called it to himself, while recognizing that his prejudice was the relic of a Victorian upbringing. But, as Bond\u0027s chief, the last thing he wanted was for Bond to be permanently tied to one woman\u0027s skirts. `Perhaps it\u0027s for the best. Doesn\u0027t do to get mixed up with neurotic women in this business. They hang on your gun-arm, if you know what I mean. Forgive me for asking about it. Had to know the answer before I told you what\u0027s come up. It\u0027s a pretty odd business. Be difficult to get you involved if you were on the edge of marrying or anything of that sort.\u0027 Bond shook his head, waiting for the story. `All right then,\u0027 said M. There was a note of relief in his voice. He leant back in his chair and gave several quick pulls on his pipe to get it going. `This is what\u0027s happened. Yesterday there was a long signal in from Istanbul. Seems on Tuesday the Head of Station T got an anonymous typewritten message which told him to take a round ticket on the 8 p.m. ferry steamer from the Galata Bridge to the mouth of the Bosphorus and back. Nothing else. Head of T\u0027s an adventurous sort of chap, and of course he took the steamer. He stood up for\u0027ard by the rail and waited. After about a quarter of an hour a girl came and stood beside him, a Russian girl, very good-looking, he says, and after they\u0027d talked a bit about the view and so on, she suddenly switched and in the same sort of conversational voice she told him an extraordinary story.\u0027 M paused to put another match to his pipe. Bond interjected, `Who is Head of T, sir? I\u0027ve never worked in Turkey.\u0027 `Man called Kerim, Darko Kerim. Turkish father and English mother. Remarkable fellow. Been Head of T since before the war. One of the best men we\u0027ve got anywhere. Does a wonderful job. Loves it. Very intelligent and he knows all that part of the world like the back of his hand.\u0027 M dismissed Kerim with a sideways jerk of his pipe. `Anyway, the girl\u0027s story was that she was a Corporal in the M.G.B. Had been in the show since she left school and had just got transferred to the Istanbul centre as a cipher officer. She\u0027d engineered the transfer because she wanted to get out of Russia and come over.\u0027 `That\u0027s good,\u0027 said Bond. `Might be useful to have one of their cipher girls. But why does she want to come over?\u0027 M looked across the table at Bond. `Because she\u0027s in love.\u0027 He paused and added mildly, `She says she\u0027s in love with you.\u0027 `In love with me?\u0027 `Yes, with you. That\u0027s what she says. Her name\u0027s Tatiana Romanova. Ever heard of her?\u0027 `Good God, no! I mean, no, sir.\u0027 M smiled at the mixture of expressions on Bond\u0027s face. `But what the hell does she mean? Has she ever met me? How does she know I exist?\u0027 `Well,\u0027 said M. `The whole thing sounds absolutely ridiculous. But it\u0027s so crazy that it just might be true. This girl is twenty-four. Ever since she joined the M.G.B. she\u0027s been working in their Central Index, the same as our Records. And she\u0027s been working in the English section of it. She\u0027s been there six years. One of the files she had to deal with was yours.\u0027 `I\u0027d like to see that one,\u0027 commented Bond. `Her story is that she first took a fancy to the photographs they\u0027ve got of you. Admired your looks and so on.\u0027 M\u0027s mouth turned downwards at the corners as if he had just sucked at a lemon. `She read up all your cases. Decided that you were the hell of a fellow.\u0027 Bond looked down his nose. M\u0027s face was non-committal. `She said you particularly appealed to her because you reminded her of the hero of a book by some Russian fellow called Lermontov. Apparently it was her favourite book. This hero chap liked gambling and spent his whole time getting in and out of scraps. Anyway, you reminded her of him. She says she came to think of nothing else, and one day the idea came to her that if only she could transfer to one of their foreign centres she could get in touch with you and you would come and rescue her.\u0027 `I\u0027ve never heard such a crazy story, sir. Surely Head of T didn\u0027t swallow it.\u0027 `Now wait a moment,\u0027 M\u0027s voice was testy. `Just don\u0027t be in too much of a hurry simply because something\u0027s turned up you\u0027ve never come across before. Suppose you happened to be a film star instead of being in this particular trade. You\u0027d get daft letters from girls all over the world stuffed with Heaven knows what sort of rot about not being able to live without you and so on. Here\u0027s a silly girl doing a secretary\u0027s job in Moscow. Probably the whole department is staffed by women, like our Records. Not a man in the room to look at, and here she is, faced with your, er, dashing features on a file that\u0027s constantly coming up for review. And she gets what I believe they call a `crush\u0027 on these pictures just as secretaries all over the world get crushes on these dreadful faces in the magazines,\u0027 M waved his pipe sideways to indicate his ignorance of these grisly female habits. `The Lord knows I don\u0027t know much about these things, but you must admit that they happen.\u0027 Bond smiled at the appeal for help. `Well, as a matter of fact, sir, I\u0027m beginning to see there is some sense in it. There\u0027s no reason why a Russian girl shouldn\u0027t be just as silly as an English one. But she must have got guts to do what she did. Does Head of T say if she realized the consequences if she was found out?\u0027 `He said she was frightened out of her wits,\u0027 said M. `Spent the whole time on the boat looking round to see if anybody was watching her. But it seems they were the usual peasants and commuters that take these boats, and as it was a late boat there weren\u0027t many passengers anyway. But wait a minute. You haven\u0027t heard half the story.\u0027 M took a long pull at his pipe and blew a cloud of smoke up towards the slowly turning fan above his head. Bond watched the smoke get caught up in the blades and whirled into nothingness. `She told Kerim that this passion for you gradually developed into a phobia. She got to hate the sight of Russian men. In time this turned into a dislike of the regime and particularly of the work she was doing for them and, so to speak, against you. So she applied for a transfer abroad, and since her languages were very good-English and French-in due course she was offered Istanbul if she would join the Cipher Department, which meant a cut in pay. To cut a long story short, after six months\u0027 training, she got to Istanbul about three weeks ago. Then she sniffed about and soon got hold of the name of our man, Kerim. He\u0027s been there so long that everybody in Turkey knows what he does by now. He doesn\u0027t mind, and it takes people\u0027s eyes off the special men we send in from time to time. There\u0027s no harm in having a front man in some of these places. Quite a lot of customers would come to us if they knew where to go and who to talk to.\u0027 Bond commented: `The public agent often does better than the man who has to spend a lot of time and energy keeping under cover.\u0027 `So she sent Kerim the note. Now she wants to know if he can help her.\u0027 M paused and sucked thoughtfully at his pipe. `Of course Kerim\u0027s first reactions were exactly the same as yours, and he fished around looking for a trap. But he simply couldn\u0027t see what the Russians could gain from sending this girl over to us. All this time the steamer was getting further and further up the Bosphorus and soon it would be turning to come back to Istanbul. And the girl got more and more desperate as Kerim went on trying to break down her story. Then,\u0027 M\u0027s eyes glittered softly across at Bond, `came the clincher.\u0027 That glitter in M\u0027s eyes, thought Bond. How well he knew those moments when M\u0027s cold eyes betrayed their excitement and their greed. `She had a last card to play. And she knew it was the ace of trumps. If she could come over to us, she would bring her cipher machine with her. It\u0027s a brand new Spektor machine. The thing we\u0027d give our eyes to have.\u0027 `God,\u0027 said Bond softly, his mind boggling at the immensity of the prize. The Spektor! The machine that would allow them to decipher the Top Secret traffic of all. To have that, even if its loss was immediately discovered and the settings changed, or the machine taken out of service in Russian embassies, and spy centres all over the world, would be a priceless victory. Bond didn\u0027t know much about cryptography, and, for security\u0027s sake, in case he was ever captured, wished to know as little as possible about its secrets, but at least he knew that, in the Russian secret service, loss of the Spektor would be counted a major disaster. Bond was sold. At once he accepted all M\u0027s faith in the girl\u0027s story, however crazy it might be. For a Russian to bring them this gift, and take the appalling risk of bringing it, could only mean an act of desperation-of desperate infatuation if you liked. Whether the girl\u0027s story was true or not, the stakes were too high to turn down the gamble. `You see, 007?\u0027 said M softly. It was not difficult to read Bond\u0027s mind from the excitement in his eyes. `You see what I mean?\u0027 Bond hedged. `But did she say how she could do it?\u0027 `Not exactly. But Kerim says she was absolutely definite. Some business about night duty. Apparently she\u0027s on duty alone certain nights of the week and sleeps on a camp bed in the office. She seemed to have no doubts about it, although she realized that she would be shot out of hand if anyone even dreamed of her plan. She was even worried about Kerim reporting all this back to me. Made him promise he would encode the signal himself and send it on a one-time-only pad and keep no copy. Naturally he did as she asked. Directly she mentioned the Spektor, Kerim knew he might be on to the most important coup that\u0027s come our way since the war.\u0027 `What happened then, sir?\u0027 `The steamer was coming up to a place called Ortakoy. She said she was going to get off there. Kerim promised to get a signal off that night. She refused to make any arrangements for staying in touch. Just said that she would keep her end of the bargain if we would keep ours. She said good night and mixed in the crowd going down the gang-plank and that was the last Kerim saw of her.\u0027 M suddenly leant forward in his chair and looked hard at Bond. `But of course he couldn\u0027t guarantee that we would make the bargain with her.\u0027 Bond said nothing. He thought he could guess what was coming. `This girl will only do these things on one condition.\u0027 M\u0027s eyes narrowed until they were fierce, significant slits. `That you go out to Istanbul and bring her and the machine back to England.\u0027 Bond shrugged his shoulders. That presented no difficulties. But ... He looked candidly back at M. `Should be a piece of cake, sir. As far as I can see there\u0027s only one snag. She\u0027s only seen photographs of me and read a lot of exciting stories. Suppose that when she sees me in the flesh, I don\u0027t come up to her expectations.\u0027 `That\u0027s where the work comes in,\u0027 said M grimly. `That\u0027s why I asked those questions about Miss Case. It\u0027s up to you to see that you do come up to her expectations.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563/46360.html","bookId":1277,"book":{"id":1277,"title":"007之俄罗斯之恋 From Russia With Love","description":"简介： 雷迪是魔鬼党的头号杀手，一直从未失手。由于007屡次破坏魔鬼党的好事，魔鬼党决心除掉他，于是放出情报说英国军方一直渴望得到的密码机在俄国。同时，俄国女郎塔迪娜向英国军方提出要求，只要他们协助她逃往西方，即可奉上密码机。英国军方于是派出007前往俄国接应塔迪...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/23/14-58-16-50-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
