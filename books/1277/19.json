{"id":33405,"no":19,"title":"Chapter Eighteen Strong Sensations","content":"The head gipsy\u0027s voice cracked out. The girls separated reluctantly and stood facing him. The gipsy began to speak in a tone of harsh denunciation. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kerim put his hand up to his mouth and whispered behind it. `Vevra is telling them that this is a great tribe of gipsies and they have brought dissension among it. He says there is no room for hatred among themselves, only against those outside. The hatred they have created must be purged so that the tribe can live peacefully again. They are to fight. If the loser is not killed she will be banished for ever. That will be the same as death. These people wither and die outside the tribe. They cannot live in our world. It is like wild beasts forced to live in a cage.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n While Kerim spoke, Bond examined the two beautiful, taut, sullen animals in the centre of the ring. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were both gipsy-dark, with coarse black hair to their shoulders, and they were both dressed in the collection of rags you associate with shanty-town negroes-tattered brown shifts that were mostly darns and patches. One was bigger-boned than the other, and obviously stronger, but she looked sullen and slow-eyed and might not be quick on her feet. She was handsome in a rather leonine way, and there was a slow red glare in her heavy lidded eyes as she stood and listened impatiently to the head of the tribe. She ought to win, thought Bond. She is half an inch taller, and she is stronger. \\n\\n \\n\\n Where this girl was a lioness, the other was a panther-lithe and quick and with cunning sharp eyes that were not on the speaker but sliding sideways, measuring inches, and the hands at her sides were curled into claws. The muscles of her fine legs looked hard as a man\u0027s. The breasts were small, and, unlike the big breasts of the other girl, hardly swelled the rags of her shift. She looks a dangerous little bitch of a girl, thought Bond. She will certainly get in the first blow. She will be too quick for the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n At once he was proved wrong. As Vavra spoke his last word, the big girl, who, Kerim whispered, was called Zora, kicked hard sideways, without taking aim, and caught the other girl square in the stomach and, as the smaller girl staggered, followed up with a swinging blow of the fist to the side of the head that knocked her sprawling on to the stone floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Oi, Vida,\u0027 lamented a woman in the crowd. She needn\u0027t have worried. Even Bond could see that Vida was shamming as she lay on the ground, apparently winded. He could see her eyes glinting under her bent arm as Zora\u0027s foot came flashing at her ribs. \\n\\n \\n\\n Vida\u0027s hands flickered out together. They grasped the ankle and her head struck into the instep like a snake\u0027s. Zora gave a scream of pain and wrenched furiously at her trapped foot. It was too late. The other girl was up on one knee, and then standing erect, the foot still in her hands. She heaved upwards and Zora\u0027s other foot left the ground and she crashed full length. \\n\\n \\n\\n The thud of the big girl\u0027s fall shook the ground. For a moment she lay still. With an animal snarl, Vida dived on top of her, clawing and tearing. \\n\\n \\n\\n My God, what a hell-cat, thought Bond. Beside him, Kerim\u0027s breath hissed tensely through his teeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the big girl protected herself with her elbows and knees and at last she managed to kick Vida off. She staggered to her feet and backed away, her lips bared from her teeth and the shift hanging in tatters from her splendid body. At once she went in to the attack again, her arms groping forward for a hold and, as the smaller girl leapt aside, Zora\u0027s hand caught the neck of her shift and split it down to the hem. But immediately Vida twisted in close under the reaching arms and her fists and knees thudded into the attacker\u0027s body. \\n\\n \\n\\n This in-fighting was a mistake. The strong arms clamped shut round the smaller girl, trapping Vida\u0027s hands low down so that they could not reach up for Zora\u0027s eyes. And, slowly, Zora began to squeeze, while Vida\u0027s legs and knees thrashed ineffectually below. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond thought that now the big girl must win. All Zora had to do was to fall on the other girl. Vida\u0027s head would crack down on the stone and then Zora could do as she liked. But all of a sudden it was the big girl who began to scream. Bond saw that Vida\u0027s head was buried deep in the other\u0027s breasts. Her teeth were at work. Zora\u0027s arms let go as she reached for Vida\u0027s hair to pull the head back and away from her. But now Vida\u0027s hands were free and they were scrabbling at the big girl\u0027s body. \\n\\n \\n\\n The girls tore apart and backed away like cats, their shining bodies glinting through the last rags of their shifts and blood showing on the exposed breasts of the big girl. \\n\\n \\n\\n They circled warily, both glad to have escaped, and as they circled they tore oft the last of their rags and threw them into the audience. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond held his breath at the sight of the two glistening, naked bodies, and he could feel Kerim\u0027s body tense beside him. The ring of gipsies seemed to have come closer to the two fighters. The moon shone on glittering eyes and there was the whisper of hot, panting breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still the two girls circled slowly, their teeth bared and their breath coming harshly. The light glinted off their heaving breasts and stomachs and off their hard, boyish flanks. Their feet left dark sweat marks on the white stones. \\n\\n \\n\\n Again it was the big girl, Zora, who made the first move with a sudden forward leap and arms held out like a wrestler\u0027s. But Vida stood her ground. Her right foot lashed out in a furious coup de savate that made a slap like a pistol shot. The big girl gave a wounded cry and clutched at herself. At once Vida\u0027s other foot kicked up to the stomach and she threw herself in after it. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a low growl from the crowd as Zora went down on her knees. Her hands went up to protect her face, but it was too late. The smaller girl was astride her, and her hands grasped Zora\u0027s wrists as she bore down on her with all her weight and bent her to the ground, her bared white teeth reaching towards the offered neck. \\n\\n \\n\\n `BOOM!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The explosion cracked the tension like a nut. A flash of flame lit the darkness behind the dance floor and a chunk of masonry sang past Bond\u0027s ear. Suddenly the orchard was full of running men and the head gipsy was slinking forward across the stone with his curved dagger held out in front of him. Kerim was going after him, a gun in his hand. As the gipsy passed the two girls, now standing wild-eyed and trembling, he shouted a word at them and they took to their heels and disappeared among the trees where the last of the women and children were already vanishing among the shadows. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond, the Beretta held uncertainly in his hand, followed slowly in the wake of Kerim towards the wide breach that had been blown out of the garden wall, and wondered what the hell was going on. \\n\\n \\n\\n The stretch of grass between the hole in the .wall and the dance floor was a turmoil of fighting, running figures. It was only as Bond came up with the fight that he distinguished the squat, conventionally dressed Bulgars from the swirling finery of the gipsies. There seemed to be more of the Faceless Ones than of the gipsies, almost two to one. As Bond peered into the struggling mass, a gipsy youth was ejected from it, clutching his stomach. He groped towards Bond, coughing terribly. Two small dark men came after him, their knives held low. \\n\\n \\n\\n Instinctively Bond stepped to one side so that the crowd was not behind the two men. He aimed at their legs above the knees and the gun in his hand cracked twice. The two men fell, soundlessly, face downwards in the grass. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two bullets gone. Only six left. Bond edged closer to the fight. \\n\\n \\n\\n A knife hissed past his head and clanged on to the dance floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n It had been aimed at Kerim, who came running out of the shadows with two men on his heels. The second man stopped and raised his knife to throw and Bond shot from the hip, blindly, and saw him fall. The other man turned and fled among the trees and Kerim dropped to one knee beside Bond, wrestling with his gun. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Cover me,\u0027 he shouted. `Jammed on the first shot. It\u0027s those bloody Bulgars. God knows what they think they\u0027re doing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n A hand caught Bond round the mouth and yanked him backwards. On his way to the ground he smelled carbolic soap and nicotine. He felt a boot thud into the back of his neck. As he whirled over sideways in the grass he expected to feel the searing flame of a knife. But the men, and there were three of them, were after Kerim, and as Bond scrambled to one knee he saw the squat black figures pile down on the crouching man, who gave one lash upwards with his useless gun and then went down under them. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the same moment as Bond leapt forward and brought his gun butt down on a round shaven head, something flashed past his eyes and the curved dagger of the head gipsy was growing out of a heaving back. Then Kerim was on his feet and the third man was running arid a man was standing in the breach in the wall shouting one word, again and again, and one by one the attackers broke off their fights and doubled over to the man and past him and out on to the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Shoot, James, shoot!\u0027 roared Kerim. `That\u0027s Krilencu.\u0027 He started to run forward. Bond\u0027s gun spat once. But the man had dodged round the wall, and thirty yards is too far for night shooting with an automatic. As Bond lowered his hot gun, there came the staccato firing of a squadron of Lambrettas, and Bond stood and listened to the swarm of wasps flying down the hill. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was silence except for the groans of the wounded. Bond listlessly watched Kerim and Vavra come back through the breach in the wall and walk among the bodies, occasionally turning one over with a foot. The other gipsies seeped back from the road and the older women came hurrying out of the shadows to tend their men. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond shook himself. What the hell had it all been about? Ten or a dozen men had been killed. What for? Whom had they been trying to get? Not him, Bond. When he was down and ready for the killing they had passed him by and made for Kerim. This was the second attempt on Kerim\u0027s life. Was it anything to do with the Romanova business? How could it possibly tie in? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond tensed. His gun spoke twice from the hip. The knife clattered harmlessly off Kerim\u0027s back. The figure that had risen from the dead twirled slowly round like a ballet dancer and toppled forward on his face. Bond ran forward. He had been just in time. The moon had caught the blade and he had had a clear field of fire. Kerim looked down at the twitching body. He turned to meet Bond. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond stopped in his tracks. `You bloody fool,\u0027 he said angrily. `Why the hell can\u0027t you take more care! You ought to have a nurse.\u0027 Most of Bond\u0027s anger came from knowing that it was he who had brought a cloud of death around Kerim. \\n\\n \\n\\n Darko Kerim grinned shamefacedly. `Now it is not good, James. You have saved my life too often. We might have been friends. Now the distance between us is too great. Forgive me, for I can never pay you back.\u0027 He held out his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond brushed it aside. `Don\u0027t be a damn fool, Darko,\u0027 he said roughly. `My gun worked, that\u0027s all. Yours didn\u0027t. You\u0027d better get one that does. For Christ\u0027s sake tell me what the hell this is all about. There\u0027s been too much blood splashing about tonight. I\u0027m sick of it. I want a drink. Come and finish that raki.\u0027 He took the big man\u0027s arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n As they reached the table, littered with the remains of the supper, a niercing, terrible scream came out of the depths of the orchard. Bond put his hand on his gun. Kerim shook his head. `We shall soon know what the Faceless Ones were after,\u0027 he said gloomily. `My friends are finding out. I can guess what they will discover. I think they will never forgive me for having been here tonight. Five of their men are dead.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `There might have been a dead woman too,\u0027 said Bond unsympathetically. `At least you\u0027ve saved her life. Don\u0027t be stupid, Darko. These gipsies knew the risks when they started spying for you against the Bulgars. It was gang warfare.\u0027 He added a dash of water to two tumblers of raki. \\n\\n \\n\\n They both emptied the glasses at one swallow. The head gipsy came up, wiping the tip of his curved dagger on a handful of grass. He sat down and Accepted a glass of raki from Bond. He seemed quite cheerful. Bond had the impression that the fight had been too short for him. The gipsy said something, slyly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kerim chuckled. `He said that his judgment was right. You killed well. Now he wants you to take on those two women.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Tell him even one of them would be too much for me. But tell him I think they are fine women. I would be glad if he would do me a favour and call the fight a draw. Enough of his people have been killed tonight. He will need these two girls to bear children for the tribe.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Kerim translated. The gipsy looked sourly at Bond and said a few bitter words. \\n\\n \\n\\n `He says that you should not have asked him such a difficult favour. He says that your heart is too soft for a good fighter. But he says he will do what you ask.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The gipsy ignored Bond\u0027s smile of thanks. He started talking fast to Kerim, who listened attentively, occasionally interrupting the flow with a question. Krilencu\u0027s name was often mentioned. Kerim talked back. There was deep contrition in his voice and he refused to allow himself to be stopped by protests from the other. There came a last reference to Krilencu. Kerim turned to Bond. \\n\\n \\n\\n `My friend,\u0027 he said drily. `It is a curious affair. It seems the Bulgars were ordered to kill Vavra and as many of his men as possible. That is a simple matter. They knew the gipsy had been working for me. Rather drastic, perhaps. But in killing, the Russians have not much finesse. They like mass death. Vavra was a main target. I was another. The declaration of war against me personally I can also understand. But it seems that you were not to be harmed. You were exactly described so that there should be no mistake. That is odd. Perhaps it was desired that there should be no diplomatic repercussions. Who can tell? The attack was well planned. They came to the top of the hill by a roundabout route and free-wheeled down so that we should hear nothing. This is a lonely place and there is not a policeman for miles. I blame myself for having treated these people too lightly.\u0027 Kerim looked puzzled and unhappy. He seemed to make up his mind. He said, `But now it is midnight. The Rolls will be here. There remains a small piece of work to be done before we go home to bed. And it is time we left these people. They have much to do before it is light. There are many bodies to go into the Bosphorus and there is the wall to be repaired. By daylight there must be no trace of these troubles. Our friend wishes you very well. He says you must return, and that Zora and Vida are yours until their breasts fall. He refuses to blame me for what has happened. He says that I am to continue sending him Bulgars. Ten were killed tonight. He would like some more. And now we will shake him by the hand and go. That is all he asks of us. We are good friends, but we are also gajos. And I expect he does not want us to see his women weeping over their dead.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Kerim stretched out his huge hand. Vavra took it and held it and looked into Kerim\u0027s eyes. For a moment his own fierce eyes seemed to go opaque. Then the gipsy let the hand drop and turned to Bond. The hand was dry and rough and padded like the paw of a big animal. Again the eyes went opaque. He let go of Bond\u0027s hand. He spoke rapidly and urgently to Kerim and turned his back on them and walked away towards the trees. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nobody looked up from his work as Kerim and Bond climbed through the breach in the wall. The Rolls stood, glittering in the moonlight, a few yards down the road opposite the cafe entrance. A young man was sitting beside the chauffeur. Kerim gestured with his hand. `That is my tenth son. He is called Boris. I thought I might need him. I shall.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The youth turned and said, `Good evening, sir.\u0027 Bond recognized him as one of the clerks in the warehouse. He was as dark and lean as the head clerk, and his eyes also were blue. \\n\\n \\n\\n The car moved down the hill. Kerim spoke to the chauffeur in English. `It is a small street off the Hippodrome Square. When we get there we will proceed softly. I will tell you when to stop. Have you got the uniforms and the equipment?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Yes, Kerim Bey.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `All right. Make good speed. It is time we were all in bed.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Kerim sank back in his seat. He took out a cigarette. They sat and smoked. Bond gazed out at the drab streets and reflected that sparse street-lighting is the sure sign of a poor town. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was some time before Kerim spoke. Then he said, `The gipsy said we both have the wings of death over us. He said that I am to beware of a son of the snows and you must beware of a man who is owned by the moon.\u0027 He laughed harshly. `That is the sort of rigmarole they talk. But he says that Krilencu isn\u0027t either of these men. That is good.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Why?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Because I cannot sleep until I have killed that man. I do not know if what happened tonight has any connection with you and your assignment. I do not care. For some reason, war has been declared on me. If I do not kill Krilencu, at the third attempt he will certainly kill me. So we are now on our way to keep an appointment with him in Samarra.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563/46366.html","bookId":1277,"book":{"id":1277,"title":"007之俄罗斯之恋 From Russia With Love","description":"简介： 雷迪是魔鬼党的头号杀手，一直从未失手。由于007屡次破坏魔鬼党的好事，魔鬼党决心除掉他，于是放出情报说英国军方一直渴望得到的密码机在俄国。同时，俄国女郎塔迪娜向英国军方提出要求，只要他们协助她逃往西方，即可奉上密码机。英国军方于是派出007前往俄国接应塔迪...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/23/14-58-16-50-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
