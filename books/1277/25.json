{"id":33411,"no":25,"title":"Chapter Twenty-Four Out of Danger?","content":"The Orient Express steamed slowly into Belgrade at three o\u0027clock in the afternoon, half an hour late. There would be an eight hours\u0027 delay while the other section of the train came in through the Iron Curtain from Bulgaria. Bond looked out at the crowds and waited for the knock on the door that would be Kerim\u0027s man. Tatiana sat huddled in her sable coat beside the door, watching Bond, wondering if he would come back to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n She had seen it all from the window-the long wicker baskets being brought out to the train, the flash of the police photographer\u0027s bulbs, the gesticulating chef de train trying to hurry up the formalities, and the tall figure of James Bond, straight and hard and cold as a butcher\u0027s knife, coming and going. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond had come back and had sat looking at her. He had asked sharp, brutal questions. She had fought desperately back, sticking coldly to her story, knowing that now, if she told him everything, told him for instance that SMERSH was involved, she would certainly lose him for ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now she sat and was afraid, afraid of the web in which she was caught, afraid of what might have been behind the lies she had been told in Moscow-above all afraid that she might lose this man who had suddenly become the light in her life. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a knock on the door. Bond got up and opened it. A tough cheerful india-rubbery man, with Kerim\u0027s blue eyes and a mop of tangled fair hair above a brown face, exploded into the compartment. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Stefan Trempo at your service,\u0027 the big smile embraced them both. `They call me ``Tempo\u0027\u0027. Where is the Chef?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Sit down,\u0027 said Bond. He thought to himself, I know it. This is another of Darko\u0027s sons. \\n\\n \\n\\n The man looked sharply at them both. He sat down carefully between them. His face was extinguished. Now the bright eyes stared at Bond with a terrible intensity in which there was fear and suspicion. His right hand slipped casually into the pocket of his coat. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Bond had finished, the man stood up. He didn\u0027t ask any questions. He said `Thank you, sir. Will you come, please. We will go to my apartment. There is much to be done.\u0027 He walked into the corridor and stood with his back to them, looking out across the rails. When the girl came out he walked down the corridor without looking back. Bond followed the girl, carrying the heavy bag and his little attaché case. \\n\\n \\n\\n They walked down the platform and into the station square. It had started to drizzle. The scene, with its sprinkling of battered taxis and vista of dull modern buildings, was depressing. The man opened the rear door of a shabby Morris Oxford saloon. He got in front and took the wheel. They bumped their way over the cobbles and on to a slippery tarmac boulevard and drove for a quarter of an hour through wide, empty streets. They saw few pedestrians and not more than a handful of other cars. \\n\\n \\n\\n They stopped half way down a cobbled side-street. Tempo led them through a wide apartment-house door and up two flights of stairs that had the smell of the Balkans-the smell of very old sweat and cigarette smoke and cabbage. He unlocked a door and showed them into a two-roomed flat with nondescript furniture and heavy red plush curtains drawn back to show the blank windows on the other side of the street. On a sideboard stood a tray with several unopened bottles, glasses and plates of fruit and biscuits-the welcome to Darko and to Darko\u0027s friends. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tempo waved vaguely towards the drinks. `Please sir, make yourself and Madam at home. There is a bathroom. No doubt you would both like to have a bath. If you will excuse me, I must telephone!\u0027 The hard facade of the face was about to crumble. The man went quickly into the bedroom and shut the door behind him. \\n\\n \\n\\n There followed two empty hours during which Bond sat and looked out of the window at the wall opposite. From time to time he got up and paced to and fro and then sat down again. For the first hour, Tatiana sat and pretended to look through a pile of magazines. Then she abruptly went into the bathroom and Bond vaguely heard water gushing into the bath. \\n\\n \\n\\n At about 6 o\u0027clock, Tempo came out of the bedroom. He told Bond that he was going out. `There is food in the kitchen. I will return at nine and take you to the train. Please treat my flat as your own.\u0027 Without waiting for Bond\u0027s reply, he walked out and softly shut the door. Bond heard his foot on the stairs and the click of the front door and the self-starter of the Morris. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond went into the bedroom and sat on the bed and picked up the telephone and talked in German to the long-distance exchange. \\n\\n \\n\\n Half an hour later there was the quiet voice of M. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond spoke as a travelling salesman would speak to the managing director :°f Universal Export. He said that his partner had gone very sick. Were there any fresh instructions? \\n\\n \\n\\n `Very sick?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Yes, sir, very.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `How about the other firm?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `There were three with us, sir. One of them caught the same thing. The other two didn\u0027t feel well on the way out of Turkey. They left us at Uzunkopru-that\u0027s the frontier.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `So the other firm\u0027s packed up?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond could see M\u0027s face as he sifted the information. He wondered if the fan was slowly revolving in the ceiling, if M had a pipe in his hand, if the Chief of Staff was listening on the other wire. \\n\\n \\n\\n `What are your ideas? Would you and your wife like to take another way home?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `I\u0027d rather you decided, sir. My wife\u0027s all right. The sample\u0027s in good condition. I don\u0027t see why it should deteriorate. I\u0027m still keen to finish the trip. Otherwise it\u0027ll remain virgin territory. We shan\u0027t know what the possibilities are.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Would you like one of our other salesmen to give you a hand?\u0027 `It shouldn\u0027t be necessary, sir. Just as you feel.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Til think about it. So you really want to see this sales campaign through?\u0027 Bond could see M\u0027s eyes glittering with the same perverse curiosity, the same rage to know, as he himself felt. `Yes, sir. Now that I\u0027m half way, it seems a pity not to cover the whole route.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `All right then. I\u0027ll think about giving you another salesman to lend a hand.\u0027 There was a pause on the end of the line. `Nothing else on your mind?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `No, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Goodbye, then.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n `Goodbye, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond put down the receiver. He sat and looked at it. He suddenly wished he had agreed with M\u0027s suggestion to give him reinforcements, just in case. He got up from the bed. At least they would soon be out of these damn Balkans and down into Italy. Then Switzerland, France-among friendly people, away from the furtive lands. \\n\\n \\n\\n And the girl, what about her? Could he blame her for the death of Kerim? Bond went into the next room and stood again by the window, looking out, wondering, going back over everything, every expression and every gesture she had made since he had first heard her voice on that night in the Kristal Palas. No, he knew he couldn\u0027t put the blame on her. If she was an agent, she was an unconscious agent. There wasn\u0027t a girl of her age in the world who could have played this role, if it was a role she was playing, without betraying herself. And he liked her. And he had faith in his instincts. Besides, with the death of Kerim, had not the plot, whatever it was, played itself out? One day he would find out what the plot had been. For the moment he was certain. Tatiana was not a conscious part of it. \\n\\n His mind made up, Bond walked over to the bathroom door and knocked. She came out and he took her in his arms and held her to him and kissed her. She clung to him. They stood and felt the animal warmth come back between them, feeling it push back the cold memory of Kerim\u0027s death. \\n\\n Tatiana broke away. She looked up at Bond\u0027s face. She reached up and brushed the black comma of hair away from his forehead. \\n\\n Her face was alive. `I am glad you have come back, James,\u0027 she said. And then, matter-of-factly, `And now we must eat and drink and start our lives again.\u0027 \\n\\n Later, after Slivovic and smoked ham and peaches, Tempo came and took them to the station and to the waiting express under the hard lights of the arcs. He said goodbye, quickly and coldly, and vanished down the platform and back into his dark existence. \\n\\n Punctually at nine the new engine gave its new kind of noise and took the long train out on its all-night run down the valley of the Sava. Bond went along to the conductor\u0027s cabin to give him money and look through the passports of the new passengers. \\n\\n Bond knew most of the signs to look for in forged passports, the blurred writing, the too exact imprints of the rubber stamps, the trace of old gum round the edges of the photograph, the slight transparencies on the pages where the fibres of the paper had been tampered with to alter a letter or a number, but the five new passports-three American and two Swiss-seemed innocent. The Swiss papers, favourites with the Russian forgers, belonged to a husband and wife, both over seventy, and Bond finally passed them and went back to the compartment and prepared for another night with Tatiana\u0027s head on his lap. \\n\\n Vincovci came and then, against a flaming dawn, the ugly sprawl of Zagreb. The train came to a stop between lines of rusting locomotives captured from the Germans and still standing forlornly amongst the grass and weeds on the sidings. Bond read the plate on one of them-BERLINER MASCHINENBAU GMBH-as they slid out through the iron cemetery. Its long black barrel had been raked with machine gun bullets. Bond heard the scream of the dive-bomber and saw the upflung arms of the driver. For a moment he thought nostalgically and unreasonably of the excitement and turmoil of the hot war, compared with his own underground skirmishings since the war had turned cold. \\n\\n They hammered into the mountains of Slovenia where the apple trees and the chalets were almost Austrian. The train laboured its way through Ljubliana. The girl awoke. They had breakfast of fried eggs and hard brown bread and coffee that was mostly chicory. The restaurant car was full of cheerful English and American tourists from the Adriatic coast, and Bond thought with a lift of the heart that by the afternoon they would be over the frontier into western Europe and that a third dangerous night was gone. \\n\\n He slept until Sezana. The hard-faced Yugoslav plain-clothes men came on board. Then Yugoslavia was gone and Poggioreale came and the first smell of the soft life with the happy jabbering of Italian officials and the carefree upturned faces of the station crowd. The new diesel-electric engine gave a slap-happy whistle, the meadow of brown hands fluttered, and they were loping easily down into Venezia, towards the distant sparkle of Trieste and the gay blue of the Adriatic. \\n\\n We\u0027ve made it, thought Bond. I really think we\u0027ve made it. He thrust the memory of the last three days away from him. Tatiana saw the tense lines in his face relax. She reached over and took his hand. He moved and sat close beside her. They looked out at the gay villas on the Corniche and at the sailing-boats and the people water-skiing. \\n\\n \\n\\n The train clanged across some points and slid quietly into the gleaming station of Trieste. Bond got up and pulled down the window and they stood side by side, looking out. Suddenly Bond felt happy. He put an arm around the girl\u0027s waist and held her hard against him. \\n\\n \\n\\n They gazed down at the holiday crowd. The sun shone through the tall clean windows of the station in golden shafts. The sparkling scene emphasized the dark and dirt of the countries the train had come from, and Bond watched with an almost sensuous pleasure the gaily dressed people pass through the patches of sunshine towards the entrance, and the sunburned people, the ones who had had their holidays, hasten up the platform to get their seats on the train. \\n\\n \\n\\n A shaft of sun lit up the head of one man who seemed typical of this happy, playtime world. The light flashed briefly on golden hair under a cap, and on a young golden moustache. There was plenty of time to catch the train. The man walked unhurriedly. It crossed Bond\u0027s mind that he was an Englishman. Perhaps it was the familiar shape of the dark green Kangol cap, or the beige, rather well-used macintosh, that badge of the English tourist, or it may have been the grey-flannelled legs, or the scuffed brown shoes. But Bond\u0027s eyes were drawn to him, as if it was someone he knew, as the man approached up the platform. \\n\\n \\n\\n The man was carrying a battered Revelation suitcase and, under the other arm, a thick book and some newspapers. He looks like an athlete, thought Bond. He has the wide shoulders and the healthy, good-looking bronzed face of a professional tennis player going home after a round of foreign tournaments. \\n\\n \\n\\n The man came nearer. Now he was looking straight at Bond. With recognition? Bond searched his mind. Did he know this man? No. He would have remembered those eyes that stared out so coldly under the pale lashes. They were opaque, almost dead. The eyes of a drowned man. But they had some message for him. What was it? Recognition? Warning? Or just the defensive reaction of Bond\u0027s own stare? \\n\\n \\n\\n The man came up with the wagon-lit. His eyes were now gazing levelly up the train. He walked past, the crêpe-soled shoes making no sound. Bond watched him reach for the rail and swing himself easily up the steps into the first-class carriage. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly Bond knew what the glance had meant, who the man was. Of course! This man was from the Service. After all M had decided to send along an extra hand. That was the message of those queer eyes. Bond would bet anything that the man would soon be along to make contact. \\n\\n \\n\\n How like M to make absolutely sure! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563/46372.html","bookId":1277,"book":{"id":1277,"title":"007之俄罗斯之恋 From Russia With Love","description":"简介： 雷迪是魔鬼党的头号杀手，一直从未失手。由于007屡次破坏魔鬼党的好事，魔鬼党决心除掉他，于是放出情报说英国军方一直渴望得到的密码机在俄国。同时，俄国女郎塔迪娜向英国军方提出要求，只要他们协助她逃往西方，即可奉上密码机。英国军方于是派出007前往俄国接应塔迪...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/23/14-58-16-50-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
