{"id":33403,"no":17,"title":"Chapter Sixteen The Tunnel of Rats","content":"Back in the cool office, while they waited for the inevitable coffee, Kerim opened a cupboard in the wall and pulled out sets of engineers\u0027 blue overalls. Kerim stripped to his shorts and dressed himself in one of the suits and pulled on a pair of rubber boots. Bond picked out a suit and a pair of boots that more or less fitted him and put them on. With the coffee, the head clerk brought in two powerful flashlights which he put on the desk. When the clerk had left the room Kerim said, `He is one of my sons-the eldest one. The others in there are all my children. The chauffeur and the watchman are uncles of mine. Common blood is the best security. And this spice business is good cover for us all. M set me up in it. He spoke to friends of his in the City of London. I am now the leading spice merchant in Turkey. I have long ago repaid M the money that was lent me. My children are shareholders in the business. They have a good life. When there is secret work to be done and I need help, I choose the child who will be most suitable. They all have training in different secret things. They are clever and brave. Some have already killed for me. They would all die for me-and for M. I have taught them he is just below God.\u0027 Kerim made a deprecating wave. `But that is just to tell you that you are in good hands.\u0027 `I hadn\u0027t imagined anything different.\u0027 `Ha!\u0027 said Kerim non-committally. He picked up the torches and handed one to Bond. `And now to work.\u0027 Kerim walked over to the wide glass-fronted bookcase and put his hand behind it. There was a click and the bookcase rolled silently and easily along the wall to the left. Behind it was a small door, flush with the wall. Kerim pressed one side of the door and it swung inwards to reveal a dark tunnel with stone steps leading straight down. A dank smell, mixed with a faint zoo stench, came out into the room. `You go first,\u0027 said Kerim. `Go down the steps to the bottom and wait. I must fix the door.\u0027 Bond switched on his torch and stepped through the opening and went carefully down the stairs. The light of the torch showed fresh masonry, and, twenty feet below, a glimmer of water. When Bond got to the bottom he found that the glimmer was a small stream running down a central gutter in the floor of an ancient stone-walled tunnel that sloped steeply up to the right. To the left, the tunnel went on downwards and would, he guessed, come out below the surface of the Golden Horn. Out of range of Bond\u0027s light there was a steady, quiet, scuttling sound, and in the blackness hundreds of pinpoints of red light flickered and moved. It was the same uphill and downhill. Twenty yards away on either side, a thousand rats were looking at Bond. They were sniffing at his scent. Bond imagined the whiskers lifting slightly from their teeth. He had a quick moment of wondering what action they would take if his torch went out. Kerim was suddenly beside him. `It is a long climb. A quarter of an hour. I hope you love animals.\u0027 Kerim\u0027s laugh boomed hugely away up the tunnel. The rats scuffled and stirred. `Unfortunately there is not much choice. Rats and bats. Squadrons of them, divisions-a whole air force and army. And we have to drive them in front of us. Towards the end of the climb it becomes quite congested. Let\u0027s get started. The air is good. It is dry underfoot on both sides of the stream. But in winter the floods come and then we have to use frogmen\u0027s suits. Keep your torch on my feet. If a bat gets in your hair, brush him off. It will not be often. Their radar is very good.\u0027 They set off up the steep slope. The smell of the rats and of the droppings of bats was thick-a mixture of monkey house arid chicken battery. It occurred to Bond that it would be days before he got rid of it. Clusters of bats hung like bunches of withered grapes from the roof and when, from time to time, either Kerim\u0027s head or Bond\u0027s brushed against them, they exploded twittering into the darkness. Ahead of them as they climbed there was the forest of squeaking, scuffling red pin-points that grew denser on both sides of the central gutter. Occasionally Kerim flashed his torch forward and the light shone on a grey field sown with glittering teeth and glinting whiskers. When this happened, an extra frenzy seized the rats, and those nearest jumped on the backs of the others to get away. All the while, fighting tumbling grey bodies came sweeping down the central gutter and, as the pressure of the mass higher up the tunnel grew heavier, the frothing rear-rank came closer. The two men kept their torches levelled like guns on the rear ranks until, after a good quarter of an hour\u0027s climb, they reached their destination. It was a deep alcove of newly faced brick in the side of the tunnel. There were two benches on each side of a thick tarpaulin-wrapped object that came down from the ceiling of the alcove. They stepped inside. Another few yards\u0027 climb, Bond thought, and mass hysteria must have seized the distant thousands of rats further up the tunnel. The horde would have turned. Out of sheer pressure for space, the rats would have braved the lights and hurled themselves down on to the two intruders, in spite of the two glaring eyes and the threatening scent. `Watch,\u0027 said Kerim. There was a moment of silence. Further up the tunnel the squeaking had stopped, as if at a word of command. Then suddenly the tunnel was a foot deep in a great wave of hurtling, scrambling grey bodies as, with a continuous high-pitched squeal, the rats turned and pelted back down the slope. For minutes the sleek grey river foamed by outside the alcove until at last the numbers thinned and only a trickle of sick or wounded rats came limping and probing their way down the tunnel floor. The scream of the horde slowly vanished down towards the river, until there was silence except for the occasional twitter of a fleeing bat. Kerim gave a non-committal grunt. `One of these days those rats will start dying. Then we shall have the plague in Istanbul again. Sometimes I feel guilty for not telling the authorities of this tunnel so that they can clean the place up. But I can\u0027t so long as the Russians are up here.\u0027 He jerked his head at the roof. He looked at his watch. `Five minutes to go. They will be pulling up their chairs and fiddling with their papers. There will be the three permanent men-M.G.B., or one of them may be from army intelligence, G.R.U. And there will probably be three others. Two came in a fortnight ago, one through Greece and another through Persia. Another one arrived on Monday. God knows who they are, or what they are here for. And sometimes the girl, Tatiana, comes in with a signal and goes out again. Let us hope we will see her today. You will be impressed. She is something.\u0027 Kerim reached up and untied the tarpaulin cover and pulled it downwards. Bond understood. The cover protected the shining butt of a submarine periscope, fully withdrawn. The moisture glistened on the thick grease of the exposed bottom joint. Bond chuckled. `Where the hell did you get that from, Darko?\u0027 `Turkish Navy. War surplus.\u0027 Kerim\u0027s voice did not invite further questions. `Now Q Branch in London is trying to fix some way of wiring the damn thing for sound. It\u0027s not going to be easy. The lens at the top of this is no bigger than a cigarette-lighter, end on. When I raise it, it comes up to floor level in their room. In the corner of the room where it comes up, we cut a small mousehole. We did it well. Once when I came to have a look, the first thing I saw was a big mousetrap with a piece of cheese on it. At least it looked big through the lens.\u0027 Kerim laughed briefly. `But there\u0027s not much room to fit a sensitive pick-up alongside the lens. And there\u0027s no hope of getting in again to do any more fiddling about with their architecture. The only way I managed to install this thing was to get my friends in the Public Works Ministry to turn the Russians out for a few days. The story was that the trams going up the hill were shaking the foundations of the houses. There had to be a survey. It cost me a few hundred pounds for the right pockets. The Public Works inspected half a dozen houses on either side of this one and declared the place safe. By that time, I and the family had finished our construction work. The Russians were suspicious as hell. I gather they went over the place with a toothcomb when they got back, looking for microphones and bombs and so on. But we can\u0027t work that trick twice. Unless Q Branch can think up something very clever, I shall have to be content with keeping an eye on them. One of these days they\u0027ll give away something useful. They\u0027ll be interrogating someone we\u0027re interested in or something of that sort.\u0027 Alongside the matrix of the periscope in the roof of the alcove there was a pendulous blister of metal, twice the size of a football. `What\u0027s that?\u0027 said Bond. `Bottom half of a bomb-a big bomb. If anything happens to me, or if war breaks out with Russia, that bomb will be set off by radio-control from my office. It is sad [Kerim didn\u0027t look sad] but I fear that many innocent people will get killed besides the Russians. When the blood is on the boil, man is as unselective as nature.\u0027 Kerim had been polishing away at the hooded eyepieces between the two handle-bars that stuck out on both sides of the base of the periscope. Now he glanced at his watch and bent down and gripped the two handles and slowly brought them up level with his chin. There was a hiss of hydraulics as the glistening stem of the periscope slid up into its steel sheath in the roof of the alcove. Kerim bent his head and gazed into the eyepieces and slowly inched up the handles until he could stand upright. He twisted gently. He centred the lens and beckoned to Bond. `Just the six of them.\u0027 Bond moved over and took the handles. `Have a good look at them,\u0027 said Kerim. `I know them, but you\u0027d better get their faces in your mind. Head of the table is their Resident Director. On his left are his two staff. Opposite them are the three new ones. The latest, who looks quite an important chap, is on the Director\u0027s right. Tell me if they do anything except talk.\u0027 Bond\u0027s first impulse was to tell Kerim not to make so much noise. It was as if he was in the room with the Russians, as if he was sitting in a chair in the corner, a secretary perhaps, taking shorthand of the conference. The wide, all-round lens, designed for spotting aircraft as well as surface ships, gave him a curious picture-a mouse\u0027s eye view of a forest of legs below the fore-edge of the table, and various aspects of the heads belonging to the legs. The Director and his two colleagues were clear-serious dull Russian faces whose characteristics Bond filed away. There was the studious, professional face of the Director-thick spectacles, lantern jaw, big forehead and thin hair brushed back. On his left was a square wooden face with deep clefts on either side of the nose, fair hair en brosse and a nick out of the left ear. The third member of the permanent staff had a shifty Armenian face with clever bright almond eyes. He was talking now. His face wore a falsely humble look. Gold glinted in his mouth. Bond could see less of the three visitors. Their backs were held towards him and only the profile of the nearest, and presumably most junior, showed clearly. This man\u0027s skin also was dark. He too would be from one of the southern republics. The jaw was badly shaved and the eye in profile was bovine and dull under a thick black brow. The nose was fleshy and porous. The upper lip was long over a sullen mouth and the beginning of a double chin. The tough black hair was cut very short so that most of the back of the neck looked blue to the level of the tips of the ears. It was a military haircut, done with mechanical clippers. The only clues to the next man were an angry boil on the back of a fat bald neck, a shiny blue suit and rather bright brown shoes. The man was motionless during the whole period that Bond kept watch and apparently never spoke. Now the senior visitor, on the right of the Resident Director, sat back and began talking. It was a strong, crag-like profile with big bones and a jutting chin under a heavy brown moustache of Stalin cut. Bond could see one cold grey eye under a bushy eyebrow and a low forehead topped by wiry grey-brown hair. This man was the only one who was smoking. He puffed busily at a tiny wooden pipe in the bowl of which stood half a cigarette. Every now and then he shook the pipe sideways so that the ash fell on the floor. His profile had more authority than any of the other faces and Bond guessed that he was a senior man sent down from Moscow. Bond\u0027s eyes were getting tired. He twisted the handles gently and looked round the office as far as the blurring jagged edges of the mousehole would allow. He saw nothing of interest-two olive green filing cabinets, a hatstand by the door, on which he counted six more or less identical grey homburgs, and a sideboard with a heavy carafe of water and some glasses. Bond stood away from the eyepiece, rubbing his eyes. `If only we could hear,\u0027 Kerim said, shaking his head sadly. It would be worth diamonds.\u0027 `It would solve a lot of problems,\u0027 agreed Bond. Then, `By the way Darko, how did you come on this tunnel? What was it built for?\u0027 Kerim bent and gave a quick glance into the eyepieces and straightened up. `It\u0027s a lost drain from the Hall of Pillars,\u0027 he said. The Hall of Pillars is now a thing for tourists. It\u0027s up above us on the heights of Istanbul, near St. Sophia. A thousand years ago it was built as a reservoir in case of siege. It\u0027s a huge underground palace, a hundred yards long and about half as broad. It was made to hold millions of gallons of water. It was discovered again about four hundred years ago by a man called Gyllius. One day I was reading his account of finding it. He said it was filled in winter from ``a great pipe with a mighty noise\u0027\u0027. It occurred to me that there might be another ``great pipe\u0027\u0027 to empty it quickly if the city fell to the enemy. I went up to the Hall of Pillars and bribed the watchman and rowed about among the pillars all one night in a rubber dinghy with one of my boys. We went over the walls with a hammer and an echo-sounder. At one end, in the most likely spot, there was a hollow sound. I handed out more money to the Minister of Public Works and he closed the place for a week-``for cleaning\u0027\u0027. My little team got busy.\u0027 Kerim ducked down again for a look through the eyepieces and went on. `We dug into the wall above waterlevel and came on the top of an arch. The arch was the beginning of a tunnel. We got into the tunnel and went down it. Quite exciting, not knowing where we were going to come out. And, of course, it went straight down the hill-under the Street of Books where the Russians have their place, and out into the Golden Horn, by the Galata Bridge, twenty yards away from my warehouse. So we filled in our hole in the Hall of Pillars and started digging from my end. That was two years ago. It took us a year and a lot of survey work to get directly under the Russians.\u0027 Kerim laughed. `And now I suppose one of these days the Russians will decide to change their offices. By then I hope someone else will be Head of T.\u0027 Kerim bent down to the rubber eyepieces. Bond saw him stiffen. Kerim said urgently. `The door\u0027s opening. Quick. Take over. Here she comes.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563/46364.html","bookId":1277,"book":{"id":1277,"title":"007之俄罗斯之恋 From Russia With Love","description":"简介： 雷迪是魔鬼党的头号杀手，一直从未失手。由于007屡次破坏魔鬼党的好事，魔鬼党决心除掉他，于是放出情报说英国军方一直渴望得到的密码机在俄国。同时，俄国女郎塔迪娜向英国军方提出要求，只要他们协助她逃往西方，即可奉上密码机。英国军方于是派出007前往俄国接应塔迪...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/23/14-58-16-50-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
