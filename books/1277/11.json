{"id":33397,"no":11,"title":"Chapter Ten The Fuse Burns","content":"It was the morning of the next day. \n \n Colonel Klebb sat at her desk in the roomy office that was her headquarters in the underground basement of SMERSH. It was more an operations room than an office. One wall was completely papered with a map of the Western Hemisphere. The opposite wall was covered with the Eastern Hemisphere. Behind her desk and within reach of her left hand, a Telekrypton occasionally chattered out a signal en clair, duplicating another machine in the Cipher Department under the tall radio masts on the roof of the building. From time to time, when Colonel Klebb thought of it, she tore off the lengthening strip of tape and read through the signals. This was a formality. If anything important happened, her telephone would ring. Every agent of SMERSH throughout the world was controlled from this room, and it was a vigilant and iron control. \n \n The heavy face looked sullen and dissipated. The chicken-skin under the eyes was pouched and the whites of the eyes were veined with red. \n \n One of the three telephones at her side purred softly. She picked up the receiver. `Send him in.\u0027 \n \n She turned to Kronsteen who sat, picking his teeth thoughtfully with an opened paper clip, in an armchair up against the left-hand wall, under the toe of Africa. `Granitsky.\u0027 \n \n Kronsteen slowly turned his head and looked at the door. Red Grant came in and closed the door softly behind him. He walked up to the desk and stood looking down, obediently, almost hungrily, into the eyes of his Commanding Officer. Kronsteen thought that he looked like a powerful mastiff, waiting to be fed. \n \n Rosa Klebb surveyed him coldly. `Are you fit and ready for work?\u0027 \n \n `Yes, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 \n \n `Let\u0027s have a look at you. Take off your clothes.\u0027 \n \n Red Grant showed no surprise. He took off his coat and, after looking around for somewhere to put it, dropped it on the floor. Then, unselfconsciously, he took off the rest of his clothes and kicked off his shoes. The great red-brown body with its golden hair lit up the drab room. Grant stood relaxed, his hands held loosely at his sides and one knee bent slightly forward, as if he was posing for an art class. \n \n Rosa Klebb got to her feet and came round the desk. She studied the body minutely, prodding here, feeling there, as if she was buying a horse. She went behind the man and continued her minute inspection. Before she came back in front of him, Kronsteen saw her slip something out of her jacket pocket and fit it into her hand. There was a glint of metal. \n \n The woman came round and stood close up to the man\u0027s gleaming stomach, her right arm behind her back. She held his eyes in hers. \n \n Suddenly, with terrific speed and the whole weight of her shoulder behind the blow, she whipped her right fist, loaded with a heavy brass knuckleduster, round and exactly into the solar plexus of the man. \n \n Whuck! \n \n Grant let out a snort of surprise and pain. His knees gave slightly, and then straightened. For a flash the eyes closed tight with agony. Then they opened again and glared redly down into the cold yellow probing eyes behind the square glasses. Apart from an angry flush on the skin just below the breast bone, Grant showed no ill effects from a blow that would have sent any normal man writhing to the ground. \n \n Rosa Klebb smiled grimly. She slipped the knuckle-duster back in her pocket and walked to her desk and sat down. She looked across at Kronsteen with a hint of pride. `At least he is fit enough,\u0027 she said. \n \n Kronsteen grunted. \n \n The naked man grinned with sly satisfaction. He brought up one hand and rubbed his stomach. \n \n Rosa Klebb sat back in her chair and watched him thoughtfully. Finally she said, `Comrade Granitsky, there is work for you. An important task. More important than anything you have attempted. It is a task that will earn you a medal\u0027-Grant\u0027s eyes gleamed-`for the target is a difficult and dangerous one. You will be in a foreign country, and alone. Is that clear?\u0027 \n \n `Yes, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 Grant was excited. Here was a chance for that big step forward. What would the medal be? The Order of Lenin? He listened carefully. \n \n `The target is an English spy. You would like to kill an English spy?\u0027 \n \n `Very much indeed, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 Grant\u0027s enthusiasm was genuine. He asked nothing better than to kill an Englishman. He had accounts to settle with the bastards. \n \n `You will need many weeks of training and preparation. On this assignment you will be operating in the guise of an English agent. Your manners and appearance are uncouth. You will have to learn at least some of the tricks,\u0027 the voice sneered, `of a chentleman. You will be placed in the hands of a certain Englishman we have here. A former chentleman of the Foreign Office in London. It will be his task to make you pass as some sort of an English spy. They employ many different kinds of men. It should not be difficult. And you will have to learn many other things. The operation will be at the end of August, but you will start your training at once. There is much to be done. Put on your clothes and report back to the A.D.C. Understood?\u0027 \n \n `Yes, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 Grant knew not to ask any questions. He scrambled into his clothes, indifferent to the woman\u0027s eyes on him, and walked over to the door, buttoning his jacket. He turned. `Thank you, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 \n \n Rosa Klebb was writing up her note of the interview. She didn\u0027t answer or look up and Grant went out and closed the door softly behind him. The woman threw down her pen and sat back. \n \n `And now, Comrade Kronsteen. Are there any points to discuss before we put the full machinery in motion? I should mention that the Praesidium has approved the target and ratified the death warrant. I have reported the broad lines of your plan to Comrade General Grubozaboyschikov. He is in agreement. The detailed execution has been left entirely in my hands. The combined planning and operations staff has been selected and is waiting to begin work. Have you any last minute thoughts, Comrade?\u0027 \n \n Kronsteen sat looking up at the ceiling, the tips of his fingers joined in front of him. He was indifferent to the condescension in the woman\u0027s voice. The pulse of concentration beat in his temples. \n \n `This man Granitsky. He is reliable? You can trust him in a foreign country? He will not go private?\u0027 \n \n `He has been tested for nearly ten years. He had had many opportunities to escape. He has been watched for signs of itching feet. There has never been a breath of suspicion. The man is in the position of a drug addict. He would no more abandon the Soviet union than a drugger would abandon the source of his cocaine. He is my top executioner. There is no one better.\u0027 \n \n `And this girl, Romanova. She was satisfactory?\u0027 \n \n The woman said grudgingly, `She is very beautiful. She will serve our purpose. She is not a virgin, but she is prudish and sexually unawakened. She will receive instruction. Her English is excellent. I have given her a certain version of her task and its object. She is co-operative. If she should show signs of faltering, I have the addresses of certain relatives, including children. I shall also have the names of her previous lovers. If necessary, it would be explained to her that these people will be hostages until her task is completed. She has an affectionate nature. Such a hint would be sufficient. But I do not anticipate any trouble from her.\u0027 \n \n `Romanova. That is the name of a buivshi-of one of the former people. It seems odd to be using a Romanov for such a delicate task.\u0027 \n \n `Her grandparents were distantly related to the Imperial Family. But she does not frequent buivshi circles. Anyway, all our grandparents were former people. There is nothing one can do about it.\u0027 \n \n `Our grandparents were not called Romanov,\u0027 said Kronsteen dryly. \n \n `However, so long as you are satisfied.\u0027 He reflected a moment. `And this man Bond. Have we discovered his whereabouts?\u0027 \n \n `Yes. The M.G.B. English network reports him in London. During the day, he goes to his headquarters. At night he sleeps in his flat in a district of London called Chelsea.\u0027 \n \n `That is good. Let us hope he stays there for the next few weeks. That will mean that he is not engaged on some operation. He will be available to go after our bait when they get the scent. Meanwhile,\u0027 Kronsteen\u0027s dark, pensive eyes continued to examine a particular point on the ceiling, `I have been studying the suitability of centres abroad. I have decided on Istanbul for the first contact. We have a good apparat there. The Secret Service has only a small station. The head of the station is reported to be a good man. He will be liquidated. The centre is conveniently placed for us, with short lines of communication with Bulgaria and the Black Sea. It is relatively far from London. I am working out details of the point of assassination and the means of getting this Bond there, after he has contacted the girl. It will be either in France or very near it. We have excellent leverage on the French press. They will make the most of this kind of story, with its sensational disclosures of sex and espionage. It also remains to be decided when Granitsky shall enter the picture. These are minor details. We must choose the cameramen and the other operatives and move them quietly into Istanbul. There must be no crowding of our apparat there, no congestion, no unusual activity. We will warn all departments that wireless traffic with Turkey is to be kept absolutely normal before and during the operation. We don\u0027t want the British interceptors smelling a rat. The Cipher Department has agreed that there is no Security objection to handing over the outer case of a Spektor machine. That will be attractive. The machine will go to the Special Devices section. They will handle its preparation.\u0027 \n \n Kronsteen stopped talking. His gaze slowly came down from the ceiling. He rose thoughtfully to his feet. He looked across and into the watchful, intent eyes of the woman. \n \n `I can think of nothing else at the moment, Comrade,\u0027 he said. `Many details will come up and have to be settled from day to day. But I think the operation can safely begin.\u0027 \n \n `I agree, Comrade. The matter can now go forward. I will issue the necessary directives.\u0027 The harsh, authoritative voice unbent. `I am grateful for your co-operation.\u0027 \n \n Kronsteen lowered his head one inch in acknowledgment. He turned and walked softly out of the room. \n \n In the silence, the Telekrypton gave a warning ping and started up its mechanical chatter. Rosa Klebb stirred in her chair and reached for one of the telephones. She dialled a number. \n \n `Operations Room,\u0027 said a man\u0027s voice. \n \n Rosa Klebb\u0027s pale eyes, gazing out across the room, lit on the pink shape on the wall-map that was England. Her wet lips parted. \n \n `Colonel Klebb speaking. The konspiratsia against the English spy Bond. The operation will commence forthwith.\u0027 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563/46358.html","bookId":1277,"book":{"id":1277,"title":"007之俄罗斯之恋 From Russia With Love","description":"简介： 雷迪是魔鬼党的头号杀手，一直从未失手。由于007屡次破坏魔鬼党的好事，魔鬼党决心除掉他，于是放出情报说英国军方一直渴望得到的密码机在俄国。同时，俄国女郎塔迪娜向英国军方提出要求，只要他们协助她逃往西方，即可奉上密码机。英国军方于是派出007前往俄国接应塔迪...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/23/14-58-16-50-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1563","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
