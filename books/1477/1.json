{"id":22729,"no":1,"title":"THE MATERNAL FEMININE","content":"Called upon to describe Aunt Sophy you would have to coin a term or fall back on the dictionary definition of a spinster. \"An unmarried woman,\" states that worthy work, baldly, \"especially when no longer young.\" That, to the world, was Sophy Decker. Unmarried, certainly. And most certainly no longer young. In figure she was, at fifty, what is known in the corset ads as a \"stylish stout.\" Well dressed in blue serge, with broad-toed health shoes and a small, astute hat. The blue serge was practical common sense. The health shoes were comfort. The hat was strictly business. Sophy Decker made and sold hats, both astute and ingenuous, to the female population of Chippewa, Wisconsin. Chippewa\u0027s East-End set bought the knowing type of hat, and the mill hands and hired girls bought the na?ve ones. But whether lumpy or possessed of that indefinable thing known as line, Sophy Decker\u0027s hats were honest hats. \\n\\n \\n\\n The world is full of Aunt Sophys, unsung. Plump, ruddy, capable women of middle age. Unwed, and rather looked down upon by a family of married sisters and tolerant, good-humoured brothers-in-law, and careless nieces and nephews. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor Aunt Soph,\" with a significant half smile. \"She\u0027s such a good old thing. And she\u0027s had so little in life, really.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She was, undoubtedly, a good old thing—Aunt Soph. Forever sending a spray of sweeping black paradise, like a jet of liquid velvet, to this pert little niece in Seattle; or taking Adele, sister Flora\u0027s daughter, to Chicago or New York, as a treat, on one of her buying trips. Burdening herself, on her business visits to these cities, with a dozen foolish shopping commissions for the idle women folk of her family. Hearing without partisanship her sisters\u0027 complaints about their husbands, and her sisters\u0027 husbands\u0027 complaints about their wives. It was always the same. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m telling you this, Sophy. I wouldn\u0027t breathe it to another living soul. But I honestly think, sometimes, that if it weren\u0027t for the children—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There is no knowing why they confided these things to Sophy instead of to each other, these wedded sisters of hers. Perhaps they held for each other an unuttered distrust or jealousy. Perhaps, in making a confidante of Sophy, there was something of the satisfaction that comes of dropping a surreptitious stone down a deep well and hearing it plunk, safe in the knowledge that it has struck no one and that it cannot rebound, lying there in the soft darkness. Sometimes they would end by saying, \"But you don\u0027t know what it is, Sophy. You can\u0027t. I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m telling you all this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But when Sophy answered, sagely, \"I know; I know\"—they paid little heed, once having unburdened themselves. The curious part of it is that she did know. She knew as a woman of fifty must know who, all her life, has given and given and in return has received nothing. Sophy Decker had never used the word inhibition in her life. I doubt if she knew what it meant. When you are busy copying French models for the fall trade you have little time or taste for Freud. She only knew (without in the least knowing she knew) that in giving of her goods, of her affections, of her time, of her energy, she found a certain relief. Her own people would have been shocked if you had told them that there was about this old maid aunt something rather splendidly Rabelaisian. Without being at all what is known as a masculine woman she had, somehow, acquired the man\u0027s viewpoint, his shrewd value sense. She ate a good deal, and enjoyed her food. She did not care for those queer little stories that married women sometimes tell, with narrowed eyes, but she was strangely tolerant of what is known as sin. So simple and direct she was that you wondered how she prospered in a line so subtle as the millinery business. \\n\\n \\n\\n You might have got a fairly true characterization of Sophy Decker from one of fifty people: from a dapper salesman in a New York or Chicago wholesale millinery house; from Otis Cowan, cashier of the First National Bank of Chippewa; from Julia Gold, her head milliner and trimmer; from almost any one, in fact, except a member of her own family. They knew her least of all, as is often true of one\u0027s own people. Her three married sisters—Grace in Seattle, Ella in Chicago, and Flora in Chippewa—regarded her with a rather affectionate disapproval from the snug safety of their own conjugal ingle-nooks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s something—well—common about Sophy,\" Flora confided to Ella. Flora, on shopping bent and Sophy, seeking hats, had made the five-hour run from Chippewa to Chicago together. \"She talks to everybody. You should have heard her with the porter on our train. Chums! And when the conductor took our tickets it was a social occasion. You know how packed the seven fifty-two is. Every seat in the parlour car taken. And Sophy asking the coloured porter about how his wife was getting along—she called him William—and if they were going to send her west, and all about her. I wish she wouldn\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Aunt Sophy undeniably had a habit of regarding people as human beings. You found her talking to chambermaids and delivery boys, and elevator starters, and gas collectors, and hotel clerks—all that aloof, unapproachable, superior crew. Under her benign volubility they bloomed and spread and took on colour as do those tight little Japanese paper water-flowers when you cast them into a bowl. It wasn\u0027t idle curiosity in her. She was interested. You found yourself confiding to her your innermost longings, your secret tribulations, under the encouragement of her sympathetic, \"You don\u0027t say!\" Perhaps it was as well that sister Flora was in ignorance of the fact that the men millinery salesmen at Danowitz \u0026 Danowitz, Importers, always called Miss Decker Aunt Soph, as, with one arm flung about her plump blue serge shoulder, they revealed to her the picture of their girl in the back flap of their bill-folder. \\n\\n \\n\\n Flora, with a firm grip on Chippewa society, as represented by the East-End set, did not find her position enhanced by a sister in the millinery business in Elm Street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course it\u0027s wonderful that she\u0027s self-supporting and successful and all,\" she told her husband. \"But it\u0027s not so pleasant for Adele, now that she\u0027s growing up, having all the girls she knows buying their hats of her aunt. Not that I—but you know how it is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n H. Charnsworth Baldwin said yes, he knew. But perhaps you, until you are made more intimately acquainted with Chippewa, Wisconsin; with the Decker girls of twenty years ago; with Flora\u0027s husband, H. Charnsworth Baldwin; and with their children Adele and Eugene, may feel a little natural bewilderment. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deckers had lived in a sagging old frame house (from which the original paint had long ago peeled in great scrofulous patches) on an unimportant street in Chippewa. There was a worm-eaten russet apple tree in the yard; an untidy tangle of wild-cucumber vine over the front porch; and an uncut brush of sunburnt grass and weeds all about. From May until September you never passed the Decker place without hearing the plunketty-plink of a mandolin from somewhere behind the vines, accompanied by a murmur of young voices, laughter, and the creak-creak of the hard-worked and protesting hammock hooks. Flora, Ella, and Grace Decker had more beaux and fewer clothes than any other girls in Chippewa. In a town full of pretty young things they were, undoubtedly, the prettiest; and in a family of pretty sisters (Sophy always excepted) Flora was the acknowledged beauty. She was the kind of girl whose nose never turns red on a frosty morning. A little, white, exquisite nose, purest example of the degree of perfection which may be attained by that vulgarest of features. Under her great gray eyes were faint violet shadows which gave her a look of almost poignant wistfulness. If there is a less hackneyed way to describe her head on its slender throat than to say it was like a lovely flower on its stalk, you are free to use it. Her slow, sweet smile gave the beholder an actual physical pang. Only her family knew she was lazy as a behemoth, untidy about her person, and as sentimental as a hungry shark. The strange and cruel part of it was that, in some grotesque, exaggerated way, as a cartoon may be like a photograph, Sophy resembled Flora. It was as though Nature, in prankish mood, had given a cabbage the colour and texture of a rose, with none of its fragile reticence and grace. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a manless household. Mrs. Decker, vague, garrulous, and given to ice-wool shawls, referred to her dead husband, in frequent reminiscence, as poor Mr. Decker. Mrs. Decker dragged one leg as she walked—rheumatism, or a spinal affection. Small wonder, then, that Sophy, the plain, with a gift for hat-making, a knack at eggless cake-baking, and a genius for turning a sleeve so that last year\u0027s style met this year\u0027s without a struggle, contributed nothing to the sag in the centre of the old twine hammock on the front porch. \\n\\n \\n\\n That the three girls should marry well, and Sophy not at all, was as inevitable as the sequence of the seasons. Ella and Grace did not manage badly, considering that they had only their girlish prettiness and the twine hammock to work with. But Flora, with her beauty, captured H. Charnsworth Baldwin. Chippewa gasped. H. Charnsworth Baldwin drove a skittish mare to a high-wheeled yellow runabout (this was twenty years ago); had his clothes made at Proctor Brothers in Milwaukee, and talked about a game called golf. It was he who advocated laying out a section of land for what he called links, and erecting a club house thereon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The section of the bluff overlooking the river,\" he explained, \"is full of natural hazards, besides having a really fine view.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Chippewa—or that comfortable, middle-class section of it which got its exercise walking home to dinner from the store at noon, and cutting the grass evenings after supper—laughed as it read this interview in the Chippewa Eagle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A golf course,\" they repeated to one another, grinning. \"Conklin\u0027s cow pasture, up the river. It\u0027s full of natural—wait a minute—what was?—oh, yeh, here it is—hazards. Full of natural hazards. Say, couldn\u0027t you die!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For H. Charnsworth Baldwin had been little Henry Baldwin before he went East to college. Ten years later H. Charnsworth, in knickerbockers and gay-topped stockings, was winning the cup in the men\u0027s tournament played on the Chippewa golf-club course, overlooking the river. And his name, in stout gold letters, blinked at you from the plate-glass windows of the office at the corner of Elm and Winnebago: \\n\\n \\n\\n NORTHERN LUMBER AND LAND COMPANY. \\n\\n H. CHARNSWORTH BALDWIN, PRES. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two blocks farther down Elm Street was another sign, not so glittering, which read: \\n\\n \\n\\n MISS SOPHY DECKER \\n\\n Millinery \\n\\n \\n\\n Sophy\u0027s hat-making, in the beginning, had been done at home. She had always made her sisters\u0027 hats, and her own, of course, and an occasional hat for a girl friend. After her sisters had married Sophy found herself in possession of a rather bewildering amount of spare time. The hat trade grew so that sometimes there were six rather botchy little bonnets all done up in yellow paper pyramids with a pin at the top, awaiting their future wearers. After her mother\u0027s death Sophy still stayed on in the old house. She took a course in millinery in Milwaukee, came home, stuck up a home-made sign in the parlour window (the untidy cucumber vines came down), and began her hat-making in earnest. In five years she had opened a shop on a side street near Elm; had painted the old house, installed new plumbing, built a warty stucco porch, and transformed the weedy, grass-tangled yard into an orderly stretch of green lawn and bright flower-beds. In ten years she was in Elm Street, and the Chippewa Eagle ran a half column twice a year describing her spring and fall openings. On these occasions Aunt Sophy, in black satin, and marcel wave, and her most relentless corsets was, in all the superficial things, not a pleat, or fold, or line, or wave behind her city colleagues. She had all the catch phrases: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is awfully good this year.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here\u0027s a sweet thing. A Mornet model.... Well, but my dear, it\u0027s the style—the line—you\u0027re paying for, not the material.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got the very thing for you. I had you in mind when I bought it. Now don\u0027t say you can\u0027t wear henna. Wait till you see it on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When she stood behind you as you sat, uncrowned and expectant before the mirror, she would poise the hat four inches above your head, holding it in the tips of her fingers, a precious, fragile thing. Your fascinated eyes were held by it, and your breath as well. Then down it descended, slowly, slowly. A quick pressure. Her fingers firm against your temples. A little sigh of relieved suspense. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s wonderful on you!... You don\u0027t! Oh, my dear! But that\u0027s because you\u0027re not used to it. You know how you said, for years, you had to have a brim, and couldn\u0027t possibly wear a turban, with your nose, until I proved to you that if the head-size was only big ... Well, perhaps this needs just a lit-tle lift here. Ju-u-ust a nip. There! That does it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And that did it. Not that Sophy Decker ever tried to sell you a hat against your judgment, taste, or will. She was too wise a psychologist and too shrewd a business woman for that. She preferred that you go out of her shop hatless rather than with an unbecoming hat. But whether you bought or not you took with you out of Sophy Decker\u0027s shop something more precious than any hatbox ever contained. Just to hear her admonishing a customer, her good-natured face all aglow: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear, always put on your hat before you get into your dress. I do. You can get your arms above your head, and set it right. I put on my hat and veil as soon\u0027s I get my hair combed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In your mind\u0027s eye you saw her, a stout, well-stayed figure in tight brassière and scant petticoat, bare-armed and bare-bosomed, in smart hat and veil, attired as though for the street from the neck up and for the bedroom from the shoulders down. \\n\\n \\n\\n The East-End set bought Sophy Decker\u0027s hats because they were modish and expensive hats. But she managed, miraculously, to gain a large and lucrative following among the paper-mill girls and factory hands as well. You would have thought that any attempt to hold both these opposites would cause her to lose one or the other. Aunt Sophy said, frankly, that of the two, she would have preferred to lose her smart trade. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The mill girls come in with their money in their hands, you might say. They get good wages and they want to spend them. I wouldn\u0027t try to sell them one of those little plain model hats. They wouldn\u0027t understand \u0027em, or like them. And if I told them the price they\u0027d think I was trying to cheat them. They want a velvet hat with something good and solid on it. Their fathers wouldn\u0027t prefer caviar to pork roast, would they? It\u0027s the same idea.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her shop windows reflected her business acumen. One was chastely, severely elegant, holding a single hat poised on a slender stick. In the other were a dozen honest arrangements of velvet and satin and plumes. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the spring opening she always displayed one of those little toques completely covered with violets. No one ever bought a hat like that. No one ever will. That violet-covered toque is a symbol. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t expect \u0027em to buy it,\" Sophy Decker explained. \"But everybody feels there should be a hat like that at a spring opening. It\u0027s like a fruit centre-piece at a family dinner. Nobody ever eats it but it has to be there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two Baldwin children—Adele and Eugene—found Aunt Sophy\u0027s shop a treasure trove. Adele, during her doll days, possessed such boxes of satin and velvet scraps, and bits of lace, and ribbon and jet as to make her the envy of all her playmates. She used to crawl about the floor of the shop workroom and under the table and chairs like a little scavenger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What in the world do you do with all that truck, child?\" asked Aunt Sophy. \"You must have barrels of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Adele stuffed another wisp of tulle into the pocket of her pinafore. \"I keep it,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n When she was ten Adele had said to her mother, \"Why do you always say \u0027Poor Sophy\u0027?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because Aunt Sophy\u0027s had so little in life. She never has married, and has always worked.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Adele considered that. \"If you don\u0027t get married do they say you\u0027re poor?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well—yes—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll get married,\" announced Adele. A small, dark, eerie child, skinny and rather foreign looking. \\n\\n \\n\\n The boy, Eugene, had the beauty which should have been the girl\u0027s. Very tall, very blond, with the straight nose and wistful eyes of the Flora of twenty years ago. \"If only Adele could have had his looks,\" his mother used to say. \"They\u0027re wasted on a man. He doesn\u0027t need them but a girl does. Adele will have to be well-dressed and interesting. And that\u0027s such hard work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Flora said she worshipped her children. And she actually sometimes still coquetted heavily with her husband. At twenty she had been addicted to baby talk when endeavouring to coax something out of someone. Her admirers had found it irresistible. At forty it was awful. Her selfishness was colossal. She affected a semi-invalidism and for fifteen years had spent one day a week in bed. She took no exercise and a great deal of baking soda and tried to fight her fat with baths. Fifteen or twenty years had worked a startling change in the two sisters, Flora the beautiful, and Sophy the plain. It was more than a mere physical change. It was a spiritual thing, though neither knew nor marked it. Each had taken on weight, the one, solidly, comfortably; the other, flabbily, unhealthily. With the encroaching fat Flora\u0027s small, delicate features seemed, somehow, to disappear in her face, so that you saw it as a large white surface bearing indentations, ridges, and hollows like one of those enlarged photographs of the moon\u0027s surface as seen through a telescope. A self-centred face, and misleadingly placid. Aunt Sophy\u0027s large, plain features, plumply padded now, impressed you as indicating strength, courage, and a great human understanding. \\n\\n \\n\\n From her husband and her children Flora exacted service that would have chafed a galley-slave into rebellion. She loved to lie in bed, in a lavender bed-jacket with ribbons, and be read to by Adele or Eugene, or her husband. They all hated it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She just wants to be waited on, and petted, and admired,\" Adele had stormed one day, in open rebellion, to her Aunt Sophy. \"She uses it as an excuse for everything and has, ever since \u0027Gene and I were children. She\u0027s as strong as an ox.\" Not a very ladylike or daughterly speech, but shockingly true. \\n\\n \\n\\n Years before a generous but misguided woman friend, coming in to call, had been ushered in to where Mrs. Baldwin lay propped up in a nest of pillows. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t blame you,\" the caller had gushed. \"If I looked the way you do in bed I\u0027d stay there forever. Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re sick, with all that lovely colour!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Flora Baldwin had rolled her eyes ceilingward. \"Nobody ever gives me credit for all my suffering and ill-health. And just because all my blood is in my cheeks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Flora was ambitious, socially, but too lazy to make the effort necessary for success in that direction. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I love my family,\" she would say. \"They fill my life. After all, that\u0027s a profession in itself—being a wife and mother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She showed her devotion by taking no interest whatever in her husband\u0027s land schemes; by forbidding Eugene to play football at school for fear he might be injured; by impressing Adele with the necessity for vivacity and modishness because of what she called her unfortunate lack of beauty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand it,\" she used to say in the child\u0027s very presence. \"Her father\u0027s handsome enough, goodness knows; and I wasn\u0027t such a fright when I was a girl. And look at her! Little, dark, skinny thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boy Eugene grew up a very silent, handsome shy young fellow. The girl dark, voluble, and rather interesting. The husband, more and more immersed in his business, was absent from home for long periods; irritable after some of these home-comings; boisterously high-spirited following other trips. Now growling about household expenses and unpaid bills; now urging the purchase of some almost prohibitive luxury. Any one but a nagging, self-absorbed, and vain woman such as Flora would have marked these unmistakable signs. But Flora was a taker, not a giver. She thought herself affectionate because she craved affection unduly. She thought herself a fond mother because she insisted on having her children with her, under her thumb, marking their devotion as a prisoner marks time with his feet, stupidly, shufflingly, advancing not a step. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sometimes Sophy the clear-eyed and level-headed, seeing this state of affairs, tried to stop it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You expect too much of your husband and children,\" she said one day, bluntly, to her sister. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I!\" Flora\u0027s dimpled hands had flown to her breast like a wounded thing. \"I! You\u0027re crazy! There isn\u0027t a more devoted wife and mother in the world. That\u0027s the trouble. I love them too much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, then,\" grimly, \"stop it for a change. That\u0027s half Eugene\u0027s nervousness—your fussing over him. He\u0027s eighteen. Give him a chance. You\u0027re weakening him. And stop dinning that society stuff into Adele\u0027s ears. She\u0027s got brains, that child. Why, just yesterday, in the workroom she got hold of some satin and a shape and turned out a little turban that Angie Hatton—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you mean to tell me that Angie Hatton saw my Adele working in your shop! Now, look here, Sophy. You\u0027re earning your living, and it\u0027s to your credit. You\u0027re my sister. But I won\u0027t have Adele associated in the minds of my friends with your hat store, understand. I won\u0027t have it. That isn\u0027t what I sent her away to an expensive school for. To have her come back and sit around a millinery workshop with a lot of little, cheap, shoddy sewing girls! Now understand, I won\u0027t have it! You don\u0027t know what it is to be a mother. You don\u0027t know what it is to have suffered. If you had brought two children into the world—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So then, it had come about, during the years between their childhood and their youth, that Aunt Sophy received the burden of their confidences, their griefs, their perplexities. She seemed, somehow, to understand in some miraculous way, and to make the burden a welcome one. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, now, you tell Aunt Sophy all about it. Stop crying, Della. How can Aunt Sophy hear when you\u0027re crying! That\u0027s my baby. Now, then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This when they were children. But with the years the habit clung and became fixed. There was something about Aunt Sophy\u0027s house—the old frame house with the warty stucco porch. For that matter, there was something about the very shop downtown, with its workroom in the rear, that had a cozy, homelike quality never possessed by the big Baldwin house. H. Charnsworth Baldwin had built a large brick mansion, in the Tudor style, on a bluff overlooking the Fox River, in the best residential section of Chippewa. It was expensively and correctly furnished. The hall consol alone was enough to strike a preliminary chill to your heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n The millinery workroom, winter days, was always bright and warm and snug. The air was a little close, perhaps, and heavy, but with a not unpleasant smell of dyes, and stuffs, and velvet, and glue, and steam, and flatiron, and a certain heady scent that Julia Gold, the head trimmer, always used. There was a sociable cat, white with a dark gray patch on his throat and a swipe of it across one flank that spoiled him for style and beauty but made him a comfortable-looking cat to have around. Sometimes, on very cold days, or in the rush reason, the girls would not go home to dinner or supper, but would bring their lunches and cook coffee over a little gas heater in the corner. Julia Gold, especially, drank quantities of coffee. Aunt Sophy had hired her from Chicago. She had been with her for five years. She said Julia was the best trimmer she had ever had. Aunt Sophy often took her to New York or Chicago on her buying trips. Julia had not much genius for original design, or she would never have been content to be head milliner in a small-town shop. But she could copy a fifty-dollar model from memory down to the last detail of crown and brim. It was a gift that made her invaluable. \\n\\n \\n\\n The boy, Eugene, used to like to look at Julia Gold. Her hair was very black and her face was very white, and her eyebrows met in a thick, dark line. Her face, as she bent over her work, was sullen and brooding, but when she lifted her head suddenly, in conversation, you were startled by a vivid flash of teeth, and eyes, and smile. Her voice was deep and low. She made you a little uncomfortable. Her eyes seemed always to be asking something. Around the work table, mornings she used to relate the dream she had had the night before. In these dreams she was always being pursued by a lover. \"And then I woke up, screaming.\" Neither she nor the sewing girls knew what she was revealing in these confidences of hers. But Aunt Sophy, the shrewd, somehow sensed it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re alone too much, evenings. That\u0027s what comes of living in a boarding house. You come over to me for a week. The change will do you good, and it\u0027ll be nice for me, too, having somebody to keep me company.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Julia often came for a week or ten days at a time. Julia, about the house after supper, was given to those vivid splashy kimonos with big flowers embroidered on them. They made her hair look blacker and her skin whiter by contrast. Sometimes Eugene or Adele or both would drop in and the four would play bridge. Aunt Sophy played a shrewd and canny game, Adele a rather brilliant one, Julia a wild and disastrous hand, always, and Eugene so badly that only Julia would take him on as a partner. Mrs. Baldwin never knew about these evenings. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was on one of these occasions that Aunt Sophy, coming unexpectedly into the living room from the kitchen where she and Adele were foraging for refreshments after the game, beheld Julia Gold and Eugene, arms clasped about each other, cheek to cheek. They started up as she came in and faced her, the woman defiantly, the boy bravely. Julia Gold was thirty (with reservations) at that time, and the boy not quite twenty-one. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How long?\" said Aunt Sophy, quietly. She had a mayonnaise spoon and a leaf of lettuce in her hand at the time, and still she did not look comic. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m crazy about her,\" said Eugene. \"We\u0027re crazy about each other. We\u0027re going to be married.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Aunt Sophy listened for the reassuring sound of Adele\u0027s spoons and plates in the kitchen. She came forward. \"Now, listen—\" she began. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I love him,\" said Julia Gold, dramatically. \"I love him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Except that it was very white and, somehow, old looking, Aunt Sophy\u0027s face was as benign as always. \"Now, look here, Julia, my girl. That isn\u0027t love and you know it. I\u0027m an old maid, but I know what love is when I see it. I\u0027m ashamed of you, Julia. Sensible woman like you. Hugging and kissing a boy like that, and old enough to be his mother, pretty near.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, look here, Aunt Soph! I\u0027m fond of you but if you\u0027re going to talk that way—Why, she\u0027s wonderful. She\u0027s taught me what it means to really—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, my land!\" Aunt Sophy sat down, looking, suddenly, very sick and old. \\n\\n \\n\\n And then, from the kitchen, Adele\u0027s clear young voice: \"Heh! What\u0027s the idea! I\u0027m not going to do all the work. Where\u0027s everybody?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Aunt Sophy started up again. She came up to them and put a hand—a capable, firm, steadying hand on the arm of each. The woman drew back but the boy did not. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you promise me not to do anything for a week? Just a week! Will you promise me? Will you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you going to tell Father?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not for a week if you\u0027ll promise not to see each other in that week. No, I don\u0027t want to send you away, Julia, I don\u0027t want to—You\u0027re not a bad girl. It\u0027s just—he\u0027s never had—at home they never gave him a chance. Just a week, Julia. Just a week, Eugene. We can talk things over then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Adele\u0027s footsteps coming from the kitchen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quick!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I promise,\" said Eugene. Julia said nothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, really,\" said Adele, from the doorway, \"you\u0027re a nervy lot, sitting around while I slave in the kitchen. \u0027Gene, see if you can open the olives with this fool can opener. I tried.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There is no knowing what she expected to do in that week, Aunt Sophy; what miracle she meant to perform. She had no plan in her mind. Just hope. She looked strangely shrunken and old, suddenly. But when, three days later, the news came that America was to go into the war she knew that her prayers were answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Flora was beside herself. \"Eugene won\u0027t have to go. He isn\u0027t quite twenty-one, thank God! And by the time he is it will be over. Surely.\" She was almost hysterical. \\n\\n \\n\\n Eugene was in the room. Aunt Sophy looked at him and he looked at Aunt Sophy. In her eyes was a question. In his was the answer. They said nothing. The next day Eugene enlisted. In three days he was gone. Flora took to her bed. Next day Adele, a faint, unwonted colour marking her cheeks, walked into her mother\u0027s bedroom and stood at the side of the recumbent figure. Her father, his hands clasped behind him, was pacing up and down, now and then kicking a cushion that had fallen to the floor. He was chewing a dead cigar, one side of his face twisted curiously over the cylinder in his mouth so that he had a sinister and crafty look. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Charnsworth, won\u0027t you please stop ramping up and down like that! My nerves are killing me. I can\u0027t help it if the war has done something or other to your business. I\u0027m sure no wife could have been more economical than I have. Nothing matters but Eugene, anyway. How could he do such a thing! I\u0027ve given my whole life to my children—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n H. Charnsworth kicked the cushion again so that it struck the wall at the opposite side of the room. Flora drew her breath in between her teeth as though a knife had entered her heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n Adele still stood at the side of the bed, looking at her mother. Her hands were clasped behind her, too. In that moment, as she stood there, she resembled her mother and her father so startlingly and simultaneously that the two, had they been less absorbed in their own affairs, must have marked it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The girl\u0027s head came up, stiffly. \"Listen. I\u0027m going to marry Daniel Oakley.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Daniel Oakley was fifty, and a friend of her father\u0027s. For years he had been coming to the house and for years she had ridiculed him. She and Eugene had called him Sturdy Oak because he was always talking about his strength and endurance, his walks, his golf, his rugged health; pounding his chest meanwhile and planting his feet far apart. He and Baldwin had had business relations as well as friendly ones. \\n\\n \\n\\n At this announcement Flora screamed and sat up in bed. H. Charnsworth stopped short in his pacing and regarded his daughter with a queer look; a concentrated look, as though what she had said had set in motion a whole maze of mental machinery within his brain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When did he ask you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s asked me a dozen times. But it\u0027s different now. All the men will be going to war. There won\u0027t be any left. Look at England and France. I\u0027m not going to be left.\" She turned squarely toward her father, her young face set and hard. \"You know what I mean. You know what I mean.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Flora, sitting up in bed, was sobbing. \"I think you might have told your mother, Adele. What are children coming to! You stand there and say, \u0027I\u0027m going to marry Daniel Oakley.\u0027 Oh, I am so faint ... all of a sudden ... get the spirits of ammonia....\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Adele turned and walked out of the room. She was married six weeks later. They had a regular pre-war wedding—veil, flowers, dinner, and all. Aunt Sophy arranged the folds of her gown and draped her veil. The girl stood looking at herself in the mirror, a curious half-smile twisting her lips. She seemed slighter and darker than ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In all this white, and my veil, I look just like a fly in a quart of milk,\" she said, with a laugh. Then, suddenly, she turned to her aunt who stood behind her and clung to her, holding her tight, tight. \"I can\u0027t!\" she gasped. \"I can\u0027t! I can\u0027t!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Aunt Sophy held her off and looked at her, her eyes searching the girl. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean, Della? Are you just nervous or do you mean you don\u0027t want to marry him? Do you mean that? Then what are you marrying for? Tell me! Tell your Aunt Sophy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Adele was straightening herself and pulling out the crushed folds of her veil. \"To pay the mortgage on the old homestead, of course. Just like the girl in the play.\" She laughed a little. But Aunt Sophy did not laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now look here, Delia. If you\u0027re—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But there was a knock at the door. Adele caught up her flowers. \"It\u0027s all right,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Aunt Sophy stood with her back against the door. \"If it\u0027s money,\" she said. \"It is! It is, isn\u0027t it! Listen. I\u0027ve got money saved. It was for you children. I\u0027ve always been afraid. I knew he was sailing pretty close, with his speculations and all, since the war. He can have it all. It isn\u0027t too late yet. Adele! Della, my baby.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t, Aunt Sophy. It wouldn\u0027t be enough, anyway. Daniel has been wonderful, really. Don\u0027t look like that. I\u0027d have hated being poor, anyway. Never could have got used to it. It is ridiculous, though, isn\u0027t it? Like one of those melodramas, or a cheap movie. I don\u0027t mind. I\u0027m lucky, really, when you come to think of it. A plain little black thing like me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But your mother—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mother doesn\u0027t know a thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Flora wept mistily all through the ceremony but Adele was composed enough for two. \\n\\n \\n\\n When, scarcely a month later, Baldwin came to Sophy Decker, his face drawn and queer, Sophy knew. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How much?\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thirty thousand will cover it. If you\u0027ve got more than that—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought Oakley—Adele said—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He did, but he won\u0027t any more, and this thing\u0027s got to be met. It\u0027s this damned war that\u0027s done it. I\u0027d have been all right. People got scared. They wanted their money. They wanted it in cash.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Speculating with it, were you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, well, a woman doesn\u0027t understand these business deals.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, naturally,\" said Aunt Sophy, \"a butterfly like me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sophy, for God\u0027s sake don\u0027t joke now. I tell you this will cover it, and everything will be all right. If I had anybody else to go to for the money I wouldn\u0027t ask you. But you\u0027ll get it back. You know that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Aunt Sophy got up, heavily, and went over to her desk. \"It was for the children, anyway. They won\u0027t need it now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked up at that. Something in her voice. \"Who won\u0027t? Why won\u0027t they?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what made me say that. I had a dream.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eugene?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, well, we\u0027re all nervous. Flora has dreams every night and presentiments every fifteen minutes. Now, look here, Sophy. About this money. You\u0027ll never know how grateful I am. Flora doesn\u0027t understand these things but I can talk to you. It\u0027s like this—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I might as well be honest about it,\" Sophy interrupted. \"I\u0027m doing it, not for you, but for Flora, and Delia—and Eugene. Flora has lived such a sheltered life. I sometimes wonder if she ever really knew any of you. Her husband, or her children. I sometimes have the feeling that Delia and Eugene are my children—were my children.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When he came home that night Baldwin told his wife that old Soph was getting queer. \"She talks about the children being hers,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, well, she\u0027s awfully fond of them,\" Flora explained. \"And she\u0027s lived her little narrow life, with nothing to bother her but her hats and her house. She doesn\u0027t know what it means to suffer as a mother suffers—poor Sophy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Um,\" Baldwin grunted. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the official notification of Eugene\u0027s death came from the War Department Aunt Sophy was so calm that it might have appeared that Flora had been right. She took to her bed now in earnest, did Flora, and they thought that her grief would end in madness. Sophy neglected everything to give comfort to the stricken two. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can you sit there like that!\" Flora would rail. \"How can you sit there like that! Even if you weren\u0027t his mother surely you must feel something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s the way he died that comforts me,\" said Aunt Sophy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What difference does that make! What difference does that make!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This is the letter that made a difference to Aunt Sophy. You will have to read it to understand, though you are likely to skip letters on the printed page. You must not skip this. \\n\\n \\n\\n AMERICAN RED CROSS \\n\\n (CROIX ROUGE AMéRICAINE) \\n\\n \\n\\n MY DEAR MRS. BALDWIN: \\n\\n \\n\\n I am sure you must have been officially notified, by now, by the U.S. War Dept. of the death of your son Lieut. Eugene H. Baldwin. But I want to write you what I can of his last hours. I was with him much of that time as his nurse. I\u0027m sure it must mean much to a mother to hear from a woman who was privileged to be with her boy at the last. \\n\\n \\n\\n Your son was brought to our hospital one night badly gassed from the fighting in the Argonne Forest. Ordinarily we do not receive gassed patients, as they are sent to a special hospital near here. But two nights before the Germans wrecked this hospital, so many gassed patients have come to us. \\n\\n \\n\\n Your son was put in the officers\u0027 ward where the doctors who examined him told me there was absolutely no hope for him, as he had inhaled the gas so much that it was only a matter of a few hours. I could scarcely believe that a man so big and strong as he was could not pull through. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first bad attack he had, losing his breath and nearly choking, rather frightened him, although the doctor and I were both with him. He held my hand tightly in his, begging me not to leave him, and repeating, over and over, that it was good to have a woman near. He was propped high in bed and put his head on my shoulder while I fanned him until he breathed more easily. I stayed with him all that night, though I was not on duty. You see, his eyes also were badly burned. But before he died he was able to see very well. I stayed with him every minute of that night and have never seen a finer character than he showed during all that dreadful fight for life. He had several bad sinking attacks that night and came through each one simply because of his great will power and fighting spirit. After each attack he would grip my hand and say, \"Well, we made it that time, didn\u0027t we, nurse? And if you\u0027ll only stay with me we\u0027ll win this fight.\" At intervals during the night I gave him sips of black coffee which was all he could swallow. Each time I gave it to him he would ask me if I had had some. That was only one instance of his thoughtfulness even in his suffering. Toward morning he asked me if he was going to die. I could not tell him the truth. He needed all his strength. I told him he had one chance in a thousand. He seemed to become very strong then, and sitting bolt upright in bed and shaking his fist, he said: \"Then by the Lord I\u0027ll fight for it!\" We kept him alive for three days, and actually thought we had won when on the third day.... \\n\\n \\n\\n But even in your sorrow you must be very proud to have been the mother of such a son.... \\n\\n \\n\\n I am a Wisconsin girl—Madison. When this is over and I come home will you let me see you so that I may tell you more than I can possibly write? \\n\\n \\n\\n MARIAN KING. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was in March, six months later, that Marian King came. They had hoped for it, but never expected it. And she came. Four people were waiting in the living room of the big Baldwin house overlooking the river. Flora and her husband, Adele and Aunt Sophy. They sat, waiting. Now and then Adele would rise, nervously, and go to the window that faced the street. Flora was weeping with audible sniffs. Baldwin sat in his chair frowning a little, a dead cigar in one corner of his mouth. Only Aunt Sophy sat quietly, waiting. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was little conversation. None in the last five minutes. Flora broke the silence, dabbing at her face with her handkerchief as she spoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sophy, how can you sit there like that? Not that I don\u0027t envy you. I do. I remember I used to feel sorry for you. I used to say, \u0027Poor Sophy.\u0027 But you unmarried ones are the happiest, after all. It\u0027s the married woman who drinks the cup to the last bitter drop. There you sit, Sophy, fifty years old, and life hasn\u0027t even touched you. You don\u0027t know how cruel life is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly, \"There!\" said Adele. The other three in the room stood up and faced the door. The sound of a motor stopping outside. Daniel Oakley\u0027s hearty voice: \"Well, it only took us five minutes from the station. Pretty good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Footsteps down the hall. Marian King stood in the doorway. They faced her, the four—Baldwin and Adele and Flora and Sophy. Marian King stood a moment, uncertainly, her eyes upon them. She looked at the two older women with swift, appraising glance. Then she came into the room, quickly, and put her two hands on Aunt Sophy\u0027s shoulders and looked into her eyes straight and sure. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must be a very proud woman,\" she said. \"You ought to be a very proud woman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2691/74047.html","bookId":1477,"book":{"id":1477,"title":"Half Portions","description":"简介： Called upon to describe Aunt Sophy you would have to coin a term or fall back on the dictionary definition of a spinster.
