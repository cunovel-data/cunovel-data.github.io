{"id":22730,"no":2,"title":"APRIL 25TH, AS USUAL","content":"Mrs. Hosea C. Brewster always cleaned house in September and April. She started with the attic and worked her purifying path down to the cellar in strict accordance with Article I, Section 1, Unwritten Rules for House Cleaning. For twenty-five years she had done it. For twenty-five years she had hated it—being an intelligent woman. For twenty-five years, towel swathed about her head, skirt pinned back, sleeves rolled up—the costume dedicated to house cleaning since the days of What\u0027s-Her-Name mother of Lemuel (see Proverbs)—Mrs. Brewster had gone through the ceremony twice a year. \n \n Furniture on the porch, woollens on the line, mattresses in the yard—everything that could be pounded, beaten, whisked, rubbed, flapped, shaken, or aired was dragged out and subjected to one or all of these indignities. After which, completely cowed, they were dragged in again and set in their places. Year after year, in attic and in cellar, things had piled up higher and higher—useless things, sentimental things; things in trunks; things in chests; shelves full of things wrapped up in brown-paper parcels. \n \n And boxes—oh, above all, boxes: pasteboard boxes, long and flat, square and oblong, each bearing weird and cryptic pencillings on one end; cryptic, that is, to any one except Mrs. Brewster and you who have owned an attic. Thus \"H\u0027s Fshg Tckl\" jabberwocked one long, slim box. Another stunned you with \"Cur Ted Slpg Pch.\" A cabalistic third hid its contents under \"Sip Cov Pinky Rm.\" To say nothing of such curt yet intriguing fragments as \"Blk Nt Drs\" and \"Sun Par Val.\" Once you had the code key they translated themselves simply enough into such homely items as Hosey\u0027s fishing tackle, canvas curtains for Ted\u0027s sleeping porch, slip covers for Pinky\u0027s room, black net dress, sun-parlour valance. \n \n The contents of those boxes formed a commentary on normal American household life as lived by Mr. and Mrs. Hosea C. Brewster, of Winnebago, Wisconsin. Hosey\u0027s rheumatism had prohibited trout fishing these ten years; Ted wrote from Arizona that \"the li\u0027l\u0027 ol\u0027 sky\" was his sleeping-porch roof and you didn\u0027t have to worry out there about the neighbours seeing you in your pyjamas; Pinky\u0027s rose-cretonne room had lacked an occupant since Pinky left the Winnebago High School for the Chicago Art Institute, thence to New York and those amazingly successful magazine covers that stare up at you from your table—young lady, hollow chested (she\u0027d need to be with that dêcolletage), carrying feather fan. You could tell a Brewster cover at sight, without the fan. That leaves the black net dress and the sun-parlour valance. The first had grown too tight under the arms (Mrs. Brewster\u0027s arms); the second had faded. \n \n Now, don\u0027t gather from this that Mrs. Brewster was an ample, pie-baking, ginghamed old soul who wore black silk and a crushed-looking hat with a palsied rose atop it. Nor that Hosea C. Brewster was spectacled and slippered. Not at all. The Hosea C. Brewsters, of Winnebago, Wisconsin, were the people you\u0027ve met on the veranda of the Moana Hotel at Honolulu, or at the top of Pike\u0027s Peak, or peering into the restless heart of Vesuvius. They were the prosperous Middle-Western type of citizen who runs down to Chicago to see the new plays and buy a hat, and to order a dozen Wedgwood salad plates at Field\u0027s. \n \n Mrs. Brewster knew about Dunsany and georgette and alligator pears; and Hosea Brewster was in the habit of dropping around to the Elks\u0027 Club, up above Schirmer\u0027s furniture store on Elm Street, at about five in the afternoon on his way home from the cold-storage plant. The Brewster place was honeycombed with sleeping porches and sun parlours and linen closets, and laundry chutes and vegetable bins and electric surprises, as your well-to-do Middle-Western house is likely to be. \n \n That house had long ago grown too large for the two of them—physically, that is. But as the big frame house had expanded, so had they—in tolerance and understanding and humanness—until now, as you talked with them, you felt that here was room and to spare of sun-filled mental chambers, and shelves well stored with experience; and pantries and bins and closets for all your worries and confidences. \n \n But the attic! And the cellar! The attic was the kind of attic every woman longs for who hasn\u0027t one and every woman loathes who has. \"If I only had some place to put things in!\" wails the first. And, \"If it weren\u0027t for the attic I\u0027d have thrown this stuff away long ago,\" complains the second. Mrs. Brewster herself had helped plan it. Hardwood floored, spacious, light, the Brewster attic revealed to you the social, ?sthetic, educational, and spiritual progress of the entire family as clearly as if a sociologist had charted it. \n \n Take, for example (before we run down to the cellar for a minute), the crayon portraits of Gran\u0027ma and Gran\u0027pa Brewster. When Ted had been a junior and Pinky a freshman at the Winnebago High School the crayon portraits had beamed down upon them from the living-room wall. To each of these worthy old people the artist had given a pair of hectic pink cheeks. Gran\u0027ma Brewster especially, simpering down at you from the labyrinthian scrolls of her sextuple gold frame, was rouged like a soubrette and further embellished with a pair of gentian-blue eyes behind steel-bowed specs. Pinky—and in fact the entire Brewster household—had thought these massive atrocities the last word in artistic ornament. By the time she reached her sophomore year, Pinky had prevailed upon her mother to banish them to the dining room. Then, two years later, when the Chicago decorator did over the living room and the dining room, the crayons were relegated to the upstairs hall. \n \n Ted and Pinky, away at school, began to bring their friends back with them for the vacations. Pinky\u0027s room had been done over in cream enamel and rose-flowered cretonne. She said the chromos in the hall spoiled the entire second floor. So the gold frames, glittering undimmed, the cheeks as rosily glowing as ever, found temporary resting place in a nondescript back chamber known as the sewing room. Then the new sleeping porch was built for Ted, and the portraits ended their journeying in the attic. \n \n One paragraph will cover the cellar. Stationary tubs, laundry stove. Behind that, bin for potatoes, bin for carrots, bins for onions, apples, cabbages. Boxed shelves for preserves. And behind that Hosea C. Brewster\u0027s bête noir and plaything, tyrant and slave—the furnace. \"She\u0027s eating up coal this winter,\" Hosea Brewster would complain. Or: \"Give her a little more draft, Fred.\" Fred, of the furnace and lawn mower, would shake a doleful head. \"She ain\u0027t drawin\u0027 good. I do\u0027 know what\u0027s got into her.\" \n \n By noon of this particular September day—a blue-and-gold Wisconsin September day—Mrs. Brewster had reached that stage in the cleaning of the attic when it looked as if it would never be clean and orderly again. Taking into consideration Miz\u0027 Merz (Miz\u0027 Merz by-the-day, you understand) and Gussie, the girl, and Fred, there was very little necessity for Mrs. Brewster\u0027s official house-cleaning uniform. She might have unpinned her skirt, unbound her head, rolled down her sleeves, and left for the day, serene in the knowledge that no corner, no chandelier, no mirror, no curlicue so hidden, so high, so glittering, so ornate that it might hope to escape the rag or brush of one or the other of this relentless and expert crew. \n \n Every year, twice a year, as this box, that trunk or chest was opened and its contents revealed, Miz\u0027 Merz would say: \"You keepin\u0027 this, Miz\u0027 Brewster?\" \n \n \"That? Oh, dear, yes!\" Or: \"Well—I don\u0027t know. You can take that home with you if you want it. It might make over for Minnie.\" \n \n Yet, why in the name of all that\u0027s ridiculous did she treasure the funeral wheat wreath in the walnut frame? Nothing is more passéthan a last summer\u0027s hat, yet the leghorn and pink-cambric-rose thing in the tin trunk was the one Mrs. Brewster had worn when a bride. Then the plaid kilted dress with the black velvet monkey jacket that Pinky had worn when she spoke her first piece at the age of seven—well, these were things that even the rapacious eye of Miz\u0027 Merz (by-the-day) passed by unbrightened by covetousness. \n \n The smell of soap and water, and cedar, and moth balls, and dust, and the ghost of a perfumery that Pinky used to use pervaded the hot attic. Mrs. Brewster, head and shoulders in a trunk, was trying not to listen and not to seem not to listen to Miz\u0027 Merz\u0027s recital of her husband\u0027s relations\u0027 latest flagrancy. \n \n \"\u0027Families is nix,\u0027 I says. \u0027I got my own fam\u0027ly to look out fur,\u0027 I says. Like that. \u0027Well,\u0027 s\u0027s he, \u0027w\u0027en it comes to that,\u0027 s\u0027s he, \u0027I guess I got some—\u0027\" Punctuated by thumps, spatterings, swashings, and much heavy breathing, so that the sound of light footsteps along the second-floor hallway, a young, clear voice calling, then the same footsteps, fleeter now, on the attic stairway, were quite unheard. \n \n Pinky\u0027s arms were around her mother\u0027s neck and for one awful moment it looked as if both were to be decapitated by the trunk lid, so violent had been Mrs. Brewster\u0027s start of surprise. \n \n Incoherent little cries, and sentences unfinished: \n \n \"Pinky! Why—my baby! We didn\u0027t get your telegram. Did you—\" \n \n \"No; I didn\u0027t. I just thought I—Don\u0027t look so dazed, mummy—You\u0027re all smudged, too—what in the world!\" Pinky straightened her hat and looked about the attic. \"Why, mother! You\u0027re—you\u0027re house cleaning!\" There was a stunned sort of look on her face. Pinky\u0027s last visit home had been in June, all hammocks, and roses, and especially baked things, and motor trips into the country. \n \n \"Of course. This is September. But if I\u0027d known you were coming—Come here to the window. Let mother see you. Is that the kind of hat they\u0027re—why, it\u0027s a winter one, isn\u0027t it? Already! Dear me, I\u0027ve just got used to the angle of my summer one. You must telephone father.\" \n \n Miz\u0027 Merz, damply calicoed, rose from a corner and came forward, wiping a moist and parboiled hand on her skirt. \"Ha\u0027 do, Pinky. Ain\u0027t forgot your old friends, have you?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s Mrs. Merz!\" Pinky put her cool, sweet fingers into the other woman\u0027s spongy clasp. \"Why, hello, Mrs. Merz! Of course when there\u0027s house cleaning—I\u0027d forgotten all about house cleaning—that there was such a thing, I mean.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s got to be done,\" replied Miz\u0027 Merz, severely. \n \n Pinky, suddenly looking like one of her own magazine covers (in tailor clothes), turned swiftly to her mother. \"Nothing of the kind,\" she said, crisply. She looked about the hot, dusty, littered room. She included and then banished it all with one sweeping gesture. \"Nothing of the kind. This is—this is an anachronism.\" \n \n \"Mebbe so,\" retorted Miz\u0027 Merz with equal crispness. \"But it\u0027s got to be cleaned just the same. Yessir; it\u0027s got to be cleaned.\" \n \n They smiled at each other then, the mother and daughter. They descended the winding attic stairs happily, talking very fast and interrupting each other. \n \n Mrs. Brewster\u0027s skirt was still pinned up. Her hair was bound in the protecting towel. \"You must telephone father. No, let\u0027s surprise him. You\u0027ll hate the dinner—built around Miz Merz; you know—boiled. Well, you know what a despot she is.\" \n \n It was hot for September, in Wisconsin. As they came out to the porch Pinky saw that there were tiny beads of moisture under her mother\u0027s eyes and about her chin. The sight infuriated her somehow. \"Well, really, mother!\" \n \n Mrs. Brewster unpinned her skirt and smoothed it down; and smiled at Pinky, all unconscious that she looked like a plump, pink Sister of Mercy with that towel bound tightly about her hair. With a swift movement Pinky unpinned the towel, unwound it, dabbed with it tenderly at her mother\u0027s chin and brow, rolled it into a vicious wad, and hurled it through the open doorway. \n \n \"Now just what does that mean?\" said Mrs. Brewster, equably. \"Take off your hat and coat, Pinky, but don\u0027t treat them that way—unless that\u0027s the way they\u0027re doing in New York. Everything is so informal since the war.\" She had a pretty wit of her own, Mrs. Brewster. \n \n Of course Pinky laughed then, and kissed her mother and hugged her hard. \"It\u0027s just that it seems so idiotic—your digging around in an attic in this day and age! Why, it\u0027s—it\u0027s—\" Pinky could express herself much more clearly in colours than in words. \"There is no such thing as an attic. People don\u0027t clean them any more. I never realized before—this huge house. It has been wonderful to come back to, of course. But just you and dad.\" She stopped. She raised two young fists high in impotent anger. \"Do you like cleaning the attic?\" \n \n \"Why, no. I hate it.\" \n \n \"Then why in the world—\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve always done it, Pinky. And while they may not be wearing attics in New York, we haven\u0027t taken them off in Winnebago. Come on up to your room, dear. It looks bare. If I\u0027d known you were coming—the slip covers—\" \n \n \"Are they in the box in the attic labelled \u0027Slp Cov Pinky Rm\u0027?\" She succeeded in slurring it ludicrously. \n \n It brought an appreciative giggle from Mrs. Brewster. A giggle need not be inconsistent, with fifty years, especially if one\u0027s nose wrinkles up delightfully in the act. But no smile curved the daughter\u0027s stern young lips. Together they went up to Pinky\u0027s old room (the older woman stopped to pick up the crumpled towel on the hall floor). On the way they paused at the door of Mrs. Brewster\u0027s bedroom, so cool, so spacious, all soft grays and blues. \n \n Suddenly Pinky\u0027s eyes widened with horror. She pointed an accusing forefinger at a large, dark object in a corner near a window. \"That\u0027s the old walnut desk!\" she exclaimed. \n \n \"I know it.\" \n \n The girl turned, half amused, half annoyed. \"Oh, mother dear! That\u0027s the situation in a nutshell. Without a shadow of doubt there\u0027s an eradicable streak of black walnut in your gray-enamel make-up.\" \n \n \"Eradicable! That\u0027s a grand word, Pinky. Stylish! I never expected to meet it out of a book. And, fu\u0027thermore, as Miz\u0027 Merz would say, I didn\u0027t know there was any situation.\" \n \n \"I meant the attic. And it\u0027s more than a situation. It\u0027s a state of mind.\" \n \n Mrs. Brewster had disappeared into the depths of her clothes closet. Her voice sounded muffled. \"Pinky, you\u0027re talking the way they did at that tea you gave for father and me when we visited New York last winter.\" She emerged with a cool-looking blue kimono. \"Here. Put this on. Father\u0027ll be home at twelve-thirty, for dinner, you know. You\u0027ll want a bath, won\u0027t you, dear?\" \n \n \"Yes. Mummy, is it boiled—honestly?—on a day like this?\" \n \n \"With onions,\" said Mrs. Brewster, firmly. \n \n Fifteen minutes later Pinky, splashing in a cool tub, heard the voice of Miz\u0027 Merz high-pitched with excitement and a certain awful joy: \"Miz\u0027 Brewster! Oh, Miz\u0027 Brewster! I found a moth in Mr. Brewster\u0027s winter flannels!\" \n \n \"Oh!\" in choked accents of fury from Pinky; and she brought a hard young fist down in the water—spat!—so that it splashed ceiling, hair, and floor impartially. \n \n Still, it was a cool and serene young daughter who greeted Hosea Brewster as he came limping up the porch stairs. He placed the flat of the foot down at each step instead of heel and ball. It gave him a queer, hitching gait. The girl felt a sharp little constriction of her throat as she marked that rheumatic limp. \"It\u0027s the beastly Wisconsin winters,\" she told herself. Then, darting out at him from the corner where she had been hiding: \"S\u0027prise! S\u0027prise!\" \n \n His plump blond face, flushed with the unwonted heat, went darkly red. He dropped his hat. His arms gathered her in. Her fresh young cheek was pressed against his dear prickly one. So they stood for a long minute—close. \n \n \"Need a shave, dad.\" \n \n \"Well, gosh, how did I know my best girl was coming!\" He held her off. \"What\u0027s the matter, Pink? Don\u0027t they like your covers any more?\" \n \n \"Not a thing, Hosey. Don\u0027t get fresh. They\u0027re decorating my studio—you know—plasterers and stuff. I couldn\u0027t work. And I was lonesome for you.\" \n \n Hosea Brewster went to the open doorway and gave a long whistle with a little quirk at the end. Then he came back to Pinky in the wide-seated porch swing. \"You know,\" he said, his voice lowered confidentially, \"I thought I\u0027d take mother to New York for ten days or so. See the shows, and run around and eat at the dens of wickedness. She likes it for a change.\" \n \n Pinky sat up, tense. \"For a change? Dad, I want to talk to you about that. Mother needs—\" \n \n Mrs. Brewster\u0027s light footstep sounded in the hall. She wore an all-enveloping gingham apron. \"How did you like your surprise, father?\" She came over to him and kissed the top of his head. \"I\u0027m getting dinner so that Gussie can go on with the attic. Everything\u0027s ready if you want to come in. I didn\u0027t want to dish up until you were at the table, so\u0027s everything would be hot.\" She threw a laughing glance at Pinky. \n \n But when they were seated, there appeared a platter of cold, thinly sliced ham for Pinky, and a crisp salad, and a featherweight cheese soufflé, and iced tea, and a dessert coolly capped with whipped cream. \n \n \"But, mother, you shouldn\u0027t have—\" feebly. \n \n \"There are always a lot of things in the house. You know that. I just wanted to tease you.\" \n \n Father Brewster lingered for an unwonted hour after the midday meal. But two o\u0027clock found him back at the cold-storage plant. Pinky watched him go, a speculative look in her eyes. \n \n She visited the attic that afternoon at four, when it was again neat, clean, orderly, smelling of soap and sunshine. Standing there in the centre of the big room, freshly napped, smartly coifed, blue-serged, trim, the very concentrated essence of modernity, she eyed with stern deliberation the funeral wheat wreath in its walnut frame; the trunks; the chests; the boxes all shelved and neatly inscribed with their \"H\u0027s Fshg Tckl\" and \"Blk Nt Drs.\" \n \n \"Barbaric!\" she said aloud, though she stood there alone. \"Medieval! Mad! It has got to be stopped. Slavery!\" After which she went downstairs and picked golden glow for the living-room vases and scarlet salvia for the bowl in the dining room. \n \n Still, as one saw Mrs. Brewster\u0027s tired droop at supper that night, there is no denying that there seemed some justification for Pinky\u0027s volcanic remarks. \n \n Hosea Brewster announced, after supper, that he and Fred were going to have a session with the furnace; she needed going over in September before they began firing up for the winter. \n \n \"I\u0027ll go down with you,\" said Pinky. \n \n \"No, you stay up here with mother. You\u0027ll get all ashes and coal dust.\" \n \n But Pinky was firm. \"Mother\u0027s half dead. She\u0027s going straight up to bed, after that darned old attic. I\u0027ll come up to tuck you in, mummy.\" \n \n And though she did not descend to the cellar until the overhauling process was nearly completed she did come down in time for the last of the scene. She perched at the foot of the stairs and watched the two men, overalled, sooty, tobacco-wreathed, and happy. When, finally, Hosea Brewster knocked the ashes out of his stubby black pipe, dusted his sooty hands together briskly, and began to peel his overalls, Pinky came forward. \n \n She put her hand on his arm. \"Dad, I want to talk to you.\" \n \n \"Careful there. Better not touch me. I\u0027m all dirt. G\u0027night, Fred.\" \n \n \"Listen, dad. Mother isn\u0027t well.\" \n \n He stopped then, with one overall leg off and the other on, and looked at her. \"Huh? What d\u0027you mean—isn\u0027t well? Mother.\" His mouth was open. His eyes looked suddenly strained. \n \n \"This house—it\u0027s killing her. She could hardly keep her eyes open at supper. It\u0027s too much for her. She ought to be enjoying herself—like other women. She\u0027s a slave to the attic and all those huge rooms. And you\u0027re another.\" \n \n \"Me?\" feebly. \n \n \"Yes. A slave to this furnace. You said yourself to Fred, just now, that it was all worn out, and needed new pipes or something—I don\u0027t know what. And that coal was so high it would be cheaper using dollar bills for fuel. Oh, I know you were just being funny. But it was partly true. Wasn\u0027t it? Wasn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"Yeh, but listen here, Paula.\" He never called her Paula unless he was terribly disturbed, \"About mother—you said—\" \n \n \"You and she ought to go away this winter—not just for a trip, but to stay. You\"—she drew a long breath and made the plunge—\"you ought to give up the house.\" \n \n \"Give up—\" \n \n \"Permanently. Mother and you are buried alive here. You ought to come to New York to live. Both of you will love it when you are there for a few days. I don\u0027t mean to come to a hotel. I mean to take a little apartment, a furnished apartment at first, to see how you like it—two rooms and kitchenette, like a playhouse.\" \n \n Hosey Brewster looked down at his own big bulk, then around the great furnace room. \"Oh, but listen—\" \n \n \"No, I want you to listen first. Mother\u0027s worn out, I tell you. It isn\u0027t as if she were the old-fashioned kind; she isn\u0027t. She loves the theatres, and pretty hats, and shoes with buckles, and lobster, and concerts.\" \n \n He broke in again: \"Sure; she likes \u0027em for a change. But for a steady diet—Besides, I\u0027ve got a business to \u0027tend to. My gosh! I\u0027ve got a business to—\" \n \n \"You know perfectly well that Wetzler practically runs the whole thing—or could, if you\u0027d let him.\" Youth is cruel like that, when it wants its way. \n \n He did not even deny it. He seemed suddenly old. Pinky\u0027s heart smote her a little. \"It\u0027s just that you\u0027ve got so used to this great barracks you don\u0027t know how unhappy it\u0027s making you. Why, mother said to-day that she hated it. I asked about the attic—the cleaning and all—and she said she hated it.\" \n \n \"Did she say that, Paula?\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n He dusted his hands together, slowly, spiritlessly. His eyes looked pained and dull. \"She did, h\u0027m? You say she did?\" He was talking to himself, and thinking, thinking. \n \n Pinky, sensing victory, left him. She ran lightly up the cellar stairs, through the first-floor rooms, and up to the second floor. Her mother\u0027s bedroom door was open. \n \n A little mauve lamp shed its glow upon the tired woman in one of the plump, gray-enamel beds. \"No, I\u0027m not sleeping. Come here, dear. What in the world have you been doing in the cellar all this time?\" \n \n \"Talking to dad.\" She came over and perched herself on the side of the bed. She looked down at her mother. Then she bent and kissed her. Mrs. Brewster looked incredibly girlish with the lamp\u0027s rosy glow on her face and her hair, warmly brown and profuse, rippling out over the pillow. Scarcely a thread of gray in it. \"You know, mother, I think dad isn\u0027t well. He ought to go away.\" \n \n As if by magic the youth and glow faded out of the face on the pillow. As she sat up, clutching her nightgown to her breast, she looked suddenly pinched and old. \"What do you mean, Pinky! Father—but he isn\u0027t sick. He—\" \n \n \"Not sick. I don\u0027t mean sick exactly. But sort of worn out. That furnace. He\u0027s sick and tired of the thing; that\u0027s what he said to Fred. He needs a change. He ought to retire and enjoy life. He could. This house is killing both of you. Why in the world don\u0027t you close it up, or sell it, and come to New York?\" \n \n \"But we do. We did. Last winter—\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t mean just for a little trip. I mean to live. Take a little two-room apartment in one of the new buildings—near my studio—and relax. Enjoy yourselves. Meet new men and women. Live! You\u0027re in a rut—both of you. Besides, dad needs it. That rheumatism of his, with these Wisconsin winters—\" \n \n \"But California—we could go to California for—\" \n \n \"That\u0027s only a stop-gap. Get your little place in New York all settled, and then run away whenever you like, without feeling that this great hulk of a house is waiting for you. Father hates it; I know it.\" \n \n \"Did he ever say so?\" \n \n \"Well, practically. He thinks you\u0027re fond of it. He—\" \n \n Slow steps ascending the stairs—heavy, painful steps. The two women listened in silence. Every footfall seemed to emphasize Pinky\u0027s words. The older woman turned her face toward the sound, her lips parted, her eyes anxious, tender. \n \n \"How tired he sounds,\" said Pinky; \"and old. And he\u0027s only—why, dad\u0027s only fifty-eight.\" \n \n \"Fifty-seven,\" snapped Mrs. Brewster, sharply, protectingly. \n \n Pinky leaned forward and kissed her. \"Good-night, mummy dear. You\u0027re so tired, aren\u0027t you?\" \n \n Her father stood in the doorway. \n \n \"Good-night, dear. I ought to be tucking you into bed. It\u0027s all turned around, isn\u0027t it? Biscuits and honey for breakfast, remember.\" \n \n So Pinky went off to her own room (sans slp cov) and slept soundly, dreamlessly, as does one whose work is well done. \n \n Three days later Pinky left. She waved a good-bye from the car platform, a radiant, electric, confident Pinky, her work well done. \n \n \"Au \u0027voir! The first of November! Everything begins then. You\u0027ll love it. You\u0027ll be real New Yorkers by Christmas. Now, no changing your minds, remember.\" \n \n And by Christmas, somehow, miraculously, there were they, real New Yorkers; or as real and as New York as any one can be who is living in a studio apartment (duplex) that has been rented (furnished) from a lady who turned out to be from Des Moines. \n \n When they arrived, Pinky had four apartments waiting for their inspection. She told them this in triumph, and well she might, it being the winter after the war, when New York apartments were as scarce as black diamonds and twice as costly. \n \n Father Brewster, on hearing the price, emitted a long, low whistle and said: \"How many rooms did you say?\" \n \n \"Two—and a kitchenette, of course.\" \n \n \"Well, then, all I can say is the furniture ought to be solid gold for that; inlaid with rubies and picked out with platinum.\" \n \n But it wasn\u0027t. In fact, it wasn\u0027t solid anything, being mostly of a very impermanent structure and style. Pinky explained that she had kept the best for the last. The thing that worried Father Brewster was that, no matter at what hour of the day they might happen to call on the prospective lessor, that person was always feminine and hatted. Once it was eleven in the morning. Once five in the afternoon. \n \n \"Do these New York women wear hats in the house all the time?\" demanded Hosea Brewster, worriedly. \"I think they sleep in \u0027em. It\u0027s a wonder they ain\u0027t bald. Maybe they are. Maybe that\u0027s why. Anyway, it makes you feel like a book agent.\" \n \n He sounded excited and tired, \"Now, father!\" said Mrs. Brewster, soothingly. \n \n They were in the elevator that was taking them up to the fourth and (according to Pinky) choicest apartment. The building was what is known as a studio apartment, in the West Sixties. The corridors were done in red flagstones, with gray-tone walls. The metal doors were painted gray. \n \n Pinky was snickering. \"Now she\u0027ll say: \u0027Well, we\u0027ve been very comfortable here.\u0027 They always do. Don\u0027t look too eager.\" \n \n \"No fear,\" put in Hosey Brewster. \n \n \"It\u0027s really lovely. And a real fireplace. Everything new and good. She\u0027s asking two hundred and twenty-five. Offer her one seventy-five. She\u0027ll take two hundred.\" \n \n \"You bet she will,\" growled Hosea. \n \n She answered the door—hatted; hatted in henna, that being the season\u0027s chosen colour. A small, dark foyer, overcrowded with furniture; a studio living room, bright, high-ceilinged, smallish; one entire side was window. There were Japanese prints, and a baby grand piano, and a lot of tables, and a davenport placed the way they do it on the stage, with its back to the room and its arms to the fireplace, and a long table just behind it, with a lamp on it, and books, and a dull jar thing, just as you\u0027ve see it in the second-act library. \n \n Hosea Brewster twisted his head around and up to gaze at the lofty ceiling. \"Feel\u0027s if I was standing at the bottom of a well,\" he remarked. \n \n But the hatted one did not hear him. \"No; no dining room,\" she was saying, briskly. \"No, indeed. I always use this gate-legged table. You see? It pulls out like this. You can easily seat six—eight, in fact.\" \n \n \"Heaven forbid!\" in fervent sotto voce from Father Brewster. \n \n \"It\u0027s an enormous saving in time and labour.\" \n \n \"The—kitchen!\" inquired Mrs. Brewster. \n \n The hat waxed playful. \"You\u0027ll never guess where the kitchen is!\" She skipped across the room. \"You see this screen?\" They saw it. A really handsome affair, and so placed at one end of the room that it looked a part of it. \"Come here.\" They came. The reverse side of the screen was dotted with hooks, and on each hook hung a pot, a pan, a ladle, a spoon. And there was the tiny gas range, the infinitesimal ice chest, the miniature sink. The whole would have been lost in one corner of the Brewster\u0027s Winnebago china closet. \n \n \"Why, how—how wonderful!\" breathed Mrs. Brewster. \n \n \"Isn\u0027t it? So complete—and so convenient. I\u0027ve cooked roasts, steaks, chops, everything right here. It\u0027s just play.\" \n \n A terrible fear seized upon Father Brewster. He eyed the sink and the tiny range with a suspicious eye. \"The beds,\" he demanded, \"where are the beds?\" \n \n She opened the little oven door and his heart sank. But, \"They\u0027re upstairs,\" she said. \"This is a duplex, you know.\" \n \n A little flight of winding stairs ended in a balcony. The rail was hung with a gay mandarin robe. Two more steps and you were in the bedroom—a rather breathless little bedroom, profusely rose-coloured, and with whole battalions of photographs in flat silver frames standing about on dressing table, shelf, desk. The one window faced a gray brick wall. \n \n They took the apartment. And thus began a life of ease and gayety for Mr. and Mrs. Hosea C. Brewster, of Winnebago, Wisconsin. \n \n Pinky had dinner with them the first night, and they laughed a great deal, what with one thing and another. She sprang up to the balcony, and let down her bright hair, and leaned over the railing, à la Juliet, having first decked Hosey out in a sketchy but effective Romeo costume consisting of a hastily snatched up scarf over one shoulder, Pinky\u0027s little turban, and a frying pan for a lute. Mother Brewster did the Nurse, and by the time Hosea began his limping climb up the balcony, the turban over one eye and the scarf winding itself about his stocky legs, they ended by tumbling in a heap of tearful laughter. \n \n After Pinky left there came upon them, in that cozy little two-room apartment, a feeling of desolation and vastness, and a terrible loneliness such as they had never dreamed of in the great twelve-room house in Winnebago. They kept close to each other. They toiled up the winding stairs together and stood a moment on the balcony, feigning a light-heartedness that neither of them felt. \n \n They lay very still in the little stuffy rose-coloured room, and the street noises of New York came up to them—a loose chain flapping against the mud guard of a taxi; the jolt of a flat-wheeled Eighth Avenue street car; the roar of an L train; laughter; the bleat of a motor horn; a piano in the apartment next door, or upstairs, or down. \n \n She thought, as she lay there, choking, of the great, gracious gray-and-blue room at home, many-windowed, sweet-smelling, quiet. Quiet! \n \n He thought, as he lay there, choking, of the gracious gray-blue room at home, many-windowed, sweet-smelling, quiet. Quiet! \n \n Then, as he had said that night in September: \"Sleeping, mother?\" \n \n \"N-no. Not yet. Just dozing off.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s the strange beds, I guess. This is going to be great, though. Great!\" \n \n \"My, yes!\" agreed Mrs. Brewster, heartily. \n \n They awoke next morning unrefreshed. Pa Brewster, back home in Winnebago, always whistled mournfully, off key, when he shaved. The more doleful his tune the happier his wife knew him to be. Also, she had learned to mark his progress by this or that passage in a refrain. Sometimes he sang, too (also off key), and you heard his genial roar all over the house. The louder he roared, and the more doleful the tune, the happier his frame of mind. Milly Brewster knew this. She had never known that she knew it. Neither had he. It was just one of those subconscious bits of marital knowledge that make for happiness and understanding. \n \n When he sang \"The Dying Cowboy\u0027s Lament\" and came to the passage, \"Oh, take me to the churchyard and lay the sod o-o-over me,\" Mrs. Brewster used to say: \"Gussie, Mr. Brewster\u0027ll be down in ten minutes. You can start the eggs.\" \n \n In the months of their gay life in Sixty-Seventh Street Hosey Brewster never once sang \"The Dying Cowboy\u0027s Lament,\" nor whistled \"In the Sweet By-and-By.\" No; he whistled not at all, or when he did, gay bits of jazz heard at the theatre or in a restaurant the night before. He deceived no one, least of all himself. Sometimes his voice would trail off into nothingness, but he would catch the tune and toss it up again, heavily, as though it were a physical weight. \n \n Theatres! Music! Restaurants! Teas! Shopping! The gay life! \n \n \"Enjoying yourself, Milly?\" he would say. \n \n \"Time of my life, father.\" \n \n She had her hair dressed in those geometrical undulations without which no New York audience feels itself clothed. They saw Pinky less frequently as time went on and her feeling of responsibility lessened. Besides, the magazine covers took most of her day. She gave a tea for her father and mother at her own studio, and Mrs. Brewster\u0027s hat, slippers, gown, and manner equalled in line, style, cut, and texture those of any other woman present, which rather surprised her until she had talked to five or six of them. \n \n She and Hosey drifted together and compared notes. \"Say, Milly,\" he confided, \"they\u0027re all from Wisconsin—or approximately; Michigan, and Minnesota, and Iowa, and around. Far\u0027s I can make out there\u0027s only one New Yorker, really, in the whole caboodle of \u0027em.\" \n \n \"Which one?\" \n \n \"That kind of plain little one over there—sensible looking, with the blue suit. I was talking to her. She was born right here in New York, but she doesn\u0027t live here—that is, not in the city. Lives in some place in the country, in a house.\" \n \n A sort of look came into Mrs. Brewster\u0027s eyes. \"Is that so? I\u0027d like to talk to her, Hosey. Take me over.\" \n \n She did talk to the quiet little woman in the plain blue suit. And the quiet little woman said: \"Oh, dear, yes!\" She ignored her r\u0027s fascinatingly, as New Yorkers do. \"We live in Connecticut. You see, you Wisconsin people have crowded us out of New York; no breathing space. Besides, how can one live here? I mean to say—live. And then the children—it\u0027s no place for children, grown up or otherwise. I love it—oh, yes, indeed. I love it. But it\u0027s too difficult.\" \n \n Mrs. Brewster defended it like a true Westerner. \"But if you have just a tiny apartment, with a kitchenette—\" \n \n The New York woman laughed. There was nothing malicious about her. But she laughed. \"I tried it. There\u0027s one corner of my soul that\u0027s still wrinkled from the crushing. Everything in a heap. Not to speak of the slavery of it. That—that deceitful, lying kitchenette.\" \n \n This was the first woman who Mrs. Brewster had talked to—really talked to—since leaving Winnebago. And she liked women. She missed them. At first she had eyed wonderingly, speculatively, the women she saw on Fifth Avenue. Swathed luxuriously in precious pelts, marvellously coifed and hatted, wearing the frailest of boots and hose, exhaling a mysterious, heady scent, they were more like strange, exotic birds than women. \n \n The clerks in the shops, too—they were so remote, so contemptuous. When she went into Gerretson\u0027s, back home, Nellie Monahan was likely to say: \"You\u0027ve certainly had a lot of wear out of that blue, Mrs. Brewster. Let\u0027s see, you\u0027ve had it two—three years this spring? My land! Let me show you our new taupes.\" \n \n Pa Brewster had taken to conversing with the doorman. That adamantine individual, unaccustomed to being addressed as a human being, was startled at first, surly and distrustful. But he mellowed under Hosey\u0027s simple and friendly advances. They became quite pals, these two—perhaps two as lonely men as you could find in all lonely New York. \n \n \"I guess you ain\u0027t a New Yorker, huh?\" Mike said. \n \n \"Me? No.\" \n \n \"Th\u0027 most of the folks in th\u0027 buildin\u0027 ain\u0027t.\" \n \n \"Ain\u0027t!\" Hosea Brewster was startled into it. \"They\u0027re artists, aren\u0027t they? Most of \u0027em?\" \n \n \"No! Out-of-town folks, mostly, like you. West—Iowa an\u0027 Californy an\u0027 around there. Livin\u0027 here, though. Seem t\u0027 like it better\u0027n where they come from. I dunno.\" \n \n Hosey Brewster took to eying them as Mrs. Brewster had eyed the women. He wondered about them, these tight, trim men, rather short of breath, buttoned so snugly into their shining shoes and their tailored clothes, with their necks bulging in a fold of fat above the back of their white linen collars. He knew that he would never be like them. It wasn\u0027t his square-toed shoes that made the difference, or his gray hat, or his baggy trousers. It was something inside him—something he lacked, he thought. It never occurred to him that it was something he possessed that they did not. \n \n \"Enjoying yourself, Milly?\" \n \n \"I should say I am, father.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s good. No housework and responsibility to this, is there?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s play.\" \n \n She hated the toy gas stove, and the tiny ice chest, and the screen pantry. All her married life she had kept house in a big, bounteous way: apples in barrels; butter in firkins; flour in sacks; eggs in boxes; sugar in bins; cream in crocks. Sometimes she told herself, bitterly, that it was easier to keep twelve rooms tidy and habitable than one combination kitchen-dining-and-living room. \n \n \"Chops taste good, Hosey?\" \n \n \"Grand. But you oughtn\u0027t to be cooking around like this. We\u0027ll eat out to-morrow night somewhere, and go to a show.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re enjoying it, aren\u0027t you, Hosey, h\u0027m?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s the life, mother! It\u0027s the life!\" \n \n His ruddy colour began to fade. He took to haunting department store kitchenware sections. He would come home with a new kind of cream whipper, or a patent device for the bathroom. He would tinker happily with this, driving a nail, adjusting a screw. At such times he was even known to begin to whistle some scrap of a doleful tune such as he used to hum. But he would change, quickly, into something lively. The price of butter, eggs, milk, cream, and the like horrified his Wisconsin cold-storage sensibilities. He used often to go down to Fulton Market before daylight and walk about among the stalls and shops, piled with tons of food of all kinds. He would talk to the marketmen, and the buyers and grocers, and come away feeling almost happy for a time. \n \n Then, one day, with a sort of shock, he remembered a farmer he had known back home in Winnebago. He knew the farmers for miles around, naturally, in his business. This man had been a steady butter-and-egg acquaintance, one of the wealthy farmers in that prosperous Wisconsin farming community. For his family\u0027s sake he had moved into town, a ruddy, rufous-bearded, clumping fellow, intelligent, kindly. They had sold the farm with a fine profit and had taken a box-like house on Franklin Street. He had nothing to do but enjoy himself. You saw him out on the porch early, very early summer mornings. \n \n You saw him ambling about the yard, poking at a weed here, a plant there. A terrible loneliness was upon him; a loneliness for the soil he had deserted. And slowly, resistlessly, the soil pulled at him with its black strength and its green tendrils down, down, until he ceased to struggle and lay there clasped gently to her breast, the mistress he had thought to desert and who had him again at last, and forever. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know what ailed him,\" his widow had said, weeping. \"He just seemed to kind of pine away.\" \n \n It was one morning in April—one soft, golden April morning—when this memory had struck Hosey Brewster. He had been down at Fulton Market. Something about the place—the dewy fresh vegetables, the crates of eggs, the butter, the cheese—had brought such a surge of homesickness over him as to amount to an actual nausea. Riding uptown in the Subway he had caught a glimpse of himself in a slot-machine mirror. His face was pale and somehow shrunken. He looked at his hands. The skin hung loose where the little pads of fat had plumped them out. \n \n \"Gosh!\" he said. \"Gosh, I—\" \n \n He thought, then, of the red-faced farmer who used to come clumping into the cold-storage warehouse in his big boots and his buffalo coat. A great fear swept over him and left him weak and sick. \n \n The chill grandeur of the studio-building foyer stabbed him. The glittering lift made him dizzy, somehow, this morning. He shouldn\u0027t have gone out without some breakfast perhaps. He walked down the flagged corridor softly; turned the key ever so cautiously. She might still be sleeping. He turned the knob gently, gently; tiptoed in and, turning, fell over a heavy wooden object that lay directly in his path in the dim little hall. \n \n A barked shin. A good, round oath. \n \n \"Hosey! What\u0027s the matter? What—\" She came running to him. She led him into the bright front room. \n \n \"What was that thing? A box or something, right there in front of the door. What the—\" \n \n \"Oh, I\u0027m so sorry, Hosey. You sometimes have breakfast downtown. I didn\u0027t know—\" \n \n Something in her voice—he stopped rubbing the injured shin to look up at her. Then he straightened slowly, his mouth ludicrously open. Her head was bound in a white towel. Her skirt was pinned back. Her sleeves were rolled up. Chairs, tables, rugs, ornaments, were huddled in a promiscuous heap. Mrs. Hosea C. Brewster was cleaning house. \n \n \"Milly!\" he began, sternly. \"And that\u0027s just the thing you came here to get away from. If Pinky—\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t mean to, father. But when I got up this morning there was a letter—a letter from the woman who owns this apartment, you know. She asked if I\u0027d go to the hall closet—the one she reserved for her own things, you know—and unlock it, and get out a box she told me about, and have the hall boy express it to her. And I did, and—look!\" \n \n Limping a little he followed her. She turned on the light that hung in the closet. Boxes—pasteboard boxes—each one bearing a cryptic pencilling on the end that stared out at you. \"Drp Stud Win,\" said one; \"Sum Slp Cov Bedrm,\" another; \"Toil. Set \u0026 Pic Frms.\" \n \n Mrs. Brewster turned to her husband, almost shamefacedly, and yet with a little air of defiance. \"It—I don\u0027t know—it made me—not homesick, Hosey. Not homesick, exactly; but—well, I guess I\u0027m not the only woman with a walnut streak in her modern make-up. Here\u0027s the woman—she came to the door with her hat on, and yet—\" \n \n Truth—blinding, white-hot truth—burst in upon him. \"Mother,\" he said—and he stood up, suddenly robust, virile, alert—\"mother, let\u0027s go home.\" \n \n Mechanically she began to unpin the looped-back skirt. \"When?\" \n \n \"Now.\" \n \n \"But, Hosey! Pinky—this flat—until June—\" \n \n \"Now! Unless you want to stay. Unless you like it here in this—this make-believe, double-barrelled, duplex do-funny of a studio thing. Let\u0027s go home, mother. Let\u0027s go home—and breathe.\" \n \n In Wisconsin you are likely to find snow in April—snow or slush. The Brewsters found both. Yet on their way up from the station in \u0027Gene Buck\u0027s flivver taxi they beamed out at it as if it were a carpet of daisies. \n \n At the corner of Elm and Jackson streets Hosey Brewster stuck his head out of the window. \"Stop here a minute, will you, \u0027Gene?\" \n \n They stopped in front of Hengel\u0027s meat market, and Hosey went in. Mrs. Brewster leaned back without comment. \n \n Inside the shop. \"Well, I see you\u0027re back from the East,\" said Aug Hengel. \n \n \"Yep.\" \n \n \"We thought you\u0027d given us the go-by, you stayed away so long.\" \n \n \"No, sir-ree! Say, Aug, give me that piece of bacon—the big piece. And send me up some corned beef to-morrow for corned beef and cabbage. I\u0027ll take a steak along for to-night. Oh, about four pounds. That\u0027s right.\" \n \n It seemed to him that nothing less than a side of beef could take out of his mouth the taste of those fiddling little lamb chops and the restaurant fare of the past six months. \n \n All through the winter Fred had kept up a little heat in the house, with an eye to frozen water pipes. But there was a chill upon the place as they opened the door now. It was late afternoon. The house was very still, with the stillness of a dwelling that has long been uninhabited. The two stood there a moment, peering into the darkened rooms. Then Hosea Brewster strode forward, jerked up this curtain, that curtain with a sharp snap, flap! He stamped his feet to rid them of slush. He took off his hat and threw it high in the air and opened his arms wide and emitted a whoop of sheer joy and relief. \n \n \"Welcome home! Home!\" \n \n She clung to him. \"Oh, Hosey, isn\u0027t it wonderful? How big it looks! Huge!\" \n \n \"Land, yes.\" He strode from hall to dining room, from kitchen to library. \"I know how a jack-in-the-box feels when the lid\u0027s opened. No wonder it grins and throws out its arms.\" \n \n They did little talking after that. By five o\u0027clock he was down in the cellar. She heard him making a great sound of rattling and bumping and shaking and pounding and shovelling. She smelled the acrid odour of his stubby black pipe. \n \n \"Hosey!\"—from the top of the cellar stairs. \"Hosey, bring up a can of preserves when you come.\" \n \n \"What?\" \n \n \"Can of preserves.\" \n \n \"What kind?\" \n \n \"Any kind you like.\" \n \n \"Can I have two kinds?\" \n \n He brought up quince marmalade and her choicest damson plums. He put them down on the kitchen table and looked around, spatting his hands together briskly to rid them of dust. \"Sh\u0027s burning pretty good now. That Fred! Don\u0027t any more know how to handle a boiler than a baby does. Is the house getting warmer?\" \n \n He clumped into the dining room, through the butler\u0027s pantry, but he was back again in a wink, his eyes round. \"Why, say, mother! You\u0027ve got out the best dishes, and the silver, and the candles, and all. And the tablecloth with the do-dads on it. Why—\" \n \n \"I know it.\" She opened the oven door, took out a pan of biscuits and slid it deftly to one side. \"It seems as if I can\u0027t spread enough. I\u0027m going to use the biggest platters, and I\u0027ve put two extra boards in the table. It\u0027s big enough to seat ten. I want everything big, somehow. I\u0027ve cooked enough potatoes for a regiment, and I know it\u0027s wasteful, and I don\u0027t care. I\u0027ll eat in my kitchen apron, if you\u0027ll keep on your overalls. Come on.\" \n \n He cut into the steak—a great, thick slice. He knew she could never eat it, and she knew she could never eat it. But she did eat it all, ecstatically. And in a sort of ecstatic Nirvana the quiet and vastness and peace of the big old frame house settled down upon them. \n \n The telephone in the hall rang startlingly, unexpectedly. \n \n \"Let me go, Milly.\" \n \n \"But who in the world! Nobody knows we\u0027re—\" \n \n He was at the telephone. \"Who? Who? Oh.\" He turned: \"It\u0027s Miz\u0027 Merz. She says her little Minnie went by at six and saw a light in the house. She—Hello! What?... She says she wants to know if she\u0027s to save time for you at the end of the month for the April cleaning.\" \n \n Mrs. Brewster took the receiver from him: \"The twenty-fifth, as usual, Miz\u0027 Merz. The twenty-fifth, as usual. The attic must be a sight.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2691/74048.html","bookId":1477,"book":{"id":1477,"title":"Half Portions","description":"简介： Called upon to describe Aunt Sophy you would have to coin a term or fall back on the dictionary definition of a spinster.
