{"id":40013,"no":5,"title":"THE SONG IN THE NIGHT. BY JAMES BUCKHAM.","content":"Bleak, barren hills and cheerless plain, All soaked and sodden with the rain; No wood to bid the camp-fire glow, No forest roof against the snow;— Drear was the dying winter day When the troops halted at Luray. Not ev\u0027n the draggled tents went up, No chance to sleep, no chance to sup! A few hours\u0027 rest upon their arms, Then—who could tell what wild alarms? \"Halt until midnight,\" orders read; \"Then, if the storm holds, march ahead.\" Tired and disheartened, faint and chill, The soldiers, scattered o\u0027er the hill, Lay in their blankets. Scarce a word In all the width of camp was heard. Out of heart was the great blue host— Out of that which they needed most,— And the General\u0027s heart was a heavy load, For well he knew what that hush must bode. Forth from the town, as if heaven-sent, Passed a child; and as on he went Something moved him to sing a song His mother taught him, while waiting long For the loyal husband, who could not stay When the first blue regiment passed that way! Sweet, and flutelike, and childish clear, The boy\u0027s voice rang through the valley drear:— Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching; Cheer up, comrades, they will come! Every soldier along the hill Felt his heart with the music thrill! All forgotten the dreary night, Hunger, and pillow frosted white. One by one, as the child-voice sang, Others joined, till the chorus rang Deep as a mighty organ tone, By the bellows of the storm-wind blown. At midnight the order passed along:— \"March!\" And they marched with their heart of song! Needless to say how they fought, that day, When the sun rose up over far Luray. And the little singer—the loyal lad Who gave, unconsciously, all he had For his country\u0027s welfare—let none deny His sovereign share in the victory! If not from his song in the dreary night, Whence came the courage to win the fight? THE REMARKABLE ADVENTURES OF SANDBOYS THE TRUE STORY OF THE MOOSE HEAD. For a great many years—for as long, indeed, as either Bob or Jack could remember—there had been over the great fireplace in the office of the Mountain House, as its chief decorative feature, a huge moose-head, from either side of which rose up majestic antlers, concerning which Bob had once remarked that \"they\u0027d make a bully hat-rack.\" [Pg 84] To this sage remark Bob\u0027s father had replied that he thought so too; and he added that he thought it somewhat of a pity that Bob, when he chose his pets, should choose pug-dogs and rabbits, that were of no earthly use, instead of an occasional moose, which might be trained to sit in the hall and allow people to hang their hats on his horns. \"Just to think,\" he said, \"what a convenience a real live walking hat-rack would be! When you wanted your hat, all you would have to do would be to whistle, and up the hat-rack would trot; you\u0027d select the hat you wished to wear, and back would go the moose again to his accustomed place between the front door and the window.\" \"I\u0027m willing,\" Bob had answered. \"You buy me the moose, daddy, and I\u0027ll be glad to make a pet of him.\" But it so happened that at the moment his father had something else to think about, and as a result Bob never got the moose. Curiously enough, up to this particular summer of which I am writing, it had never occurred to either of the boys to inquire into the story of this especial moose, who had been so greatly honored by having his head stuffed and hung up to beautify the office of the hotel. They had both of them often wondered somewhat as to how it came to lose the rear portions of its body—that from its shoulders backward—but at such times it had so happened there had never been anybody about who could be counted upon to enlighten them on the subject. Now, however, it was different. Sandboys seemed always at hand, and considering that he had never failed them when they had asked for an explanation of this, that, or the other thing, they confidently broached the subject to him one afternoon during the music hour, and, as usual, Sandboys was ready with a \"true story\" for their satisfaction. \"Oh, that!\" he said, when Bob had put the question. \"Yes, I know all about it; and why shouldn\u0027t I? Didn\u0027t my father catch him? I guess!\" The boys were not quite sure whether the guess was correct or not, but they deemed it well to suppose that it was, and Sandboys went on. \"Some folks about here will tell you wonderful stories about that moose,\" he said. \"Some will tell you it came from Maine; and some will tell you it came from Canady; and some will tell you they don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 at all about it; an\u0027 generally it\u0027ll be the last ones that tell the whole truth, though it did come from both Canady an\u0027 Maine; and, what\u0027s more, if it hadn\u0027t come, I wouldn\u0027t ha\u0027 been here. Nobody knows that but me, for up to now I haven\u0027t breathed a word about it to a soul, but I don\u0027t mind tellin\u0027 you boys the whole truth.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say it got you your position here as a bell-boy, do you?\" asked Jack. \"Yes, I do—that is, it did in a way, as you\u0027ll see when I\u0027ve told you the whole story,\" returned Sandboys, and he began: \"My father, when he was a boy, used to live up in Canady. I don\u0027t recollect the name of the exact place. He told me its name lots o\u0027 times, but it was one o\u0027 them French-Canadian names with an accent to it I never could get the hang of. Names of English towns, like London or New York, I can always remember without much trouble, because I can spell \u0027em and pronounce \u0027em; but the minute they gets mixed in with a little foreign language, like French or Eyetalian, I can\u0027t spell \u0027em, pronounce \u0027em, or remember \u0027em to save my life. If anybody\u0027d say to me, \u0027Remember the name o\u0027 that town or die,\u0027 I think that I\u0027d simply have to stop breathin\u0027 an\u0027 die. I do remember, though, that it was a great place for salmon and mooses. My daddy used to tell me reg\u0027lar slews of stories about \u0027em. Why, he told me the salmon was so thick in the river back of his father\u0027s barn, that if you took a bean-shooter and shot anywhere into the river, usin\u0027 pebbles instead o\u0027 beans, you couldn\u0027t help hittin\u0027 a salmon on the head and killin\u0027 it—or, rather, knockin\u0027 it unconscious, so\u0027s it would flop over and rise to the surface like it was dead, after which all you had to do was to catch it by the tail, chop its head off as you would a chicken\u0027s, cook it, and have your marketing done for two weeks.\" \"Jiminny!\" said Bob. \"It\u0027s too bad you can\u0027t remember the name of that place. A hotel at a place like that would be good as a mint.\" \"Oh no—it\u0027s all changed now,\" said Sandboys, sadly. \"They\u0027ve put a saw-mill in there now, and the salmon\u0027s mostly all gone. Sometimes they tell me they do catch one or two, and they\u0027re so big they cut \u0027em up in the saw-mill just like planks, and feed on \u0027em all through the winter.\" \"I\u0027ve heard of planked shad,\" put in Bob, very anxious indeed to believe in the truth of Sandboys\u0027s statement, and searching in his mind for something in the way of a parallel which might give it a color of veracity. \"Hyops!\" said Sandboys. \"Planked shad is very good, but it can\u0027t hold a candle to planked salmon. But, as I was tellin\u0027 you, the place was full of moose too. They used to catch \u0027em and train \u0027em to go in harness. I don\u0027t believe anybody up there ever thought of buying a horse or a team of oxen to pull their wagons and plough their fields, moose were so plenty, and, when you could catch \u0027em hungry, so easy to tame. They\u0027d hitch \u0027em to the plough, for instance, with ropes tied to their horns, and drive \u0027em around all day, and when night came they weren\u0027t a bit tired. But sometimes daddy said they\u0027d strike a fearfully wild one, and then there\u0027d be trouble. Pop told me he hitched one up to the harrow once, and the thing got a wild fit on and started across the field prancin\u0027 like a Rocky Mountain goat. He pulled up all the fences in his way with the harrow\u0027s teeth, and before he stopped he\u0027d gone right through my grandfather\u0027s bay-window, into the dinin\u0027-room, out the back door into the kitchen, takin\u0027 all the tables and chiny in the place with him. Where he went to nobody ever knew, though the harrow was found on top o\u0027 one of the mountains about sixty miles away, three years afterwards. I\u0027d tell you the name of the mountain, only it had one o\u0027 those French-Canadian names too, so of course I can\u0027t. \"Time went on, and pop got to be a pretty big boy, and on his thirteenth birthday his father gave him the gun he\u0027d used in the war—the war of the Revylation, I think it was, when George Washington was runnin\u0027 things. With it he gave him a powder-flask and some bullets, and I tell you pop was proud, and crazy to go huntin\u0027. His father wasn\u0027t anxious to let him, though, until he thought pop knew enough about fire-arms to kill something besides himself, and he told him no, he couldn\u0027t. He must wait awhile. So pop tried to be good and obey, but that gun was too much for him. It kept hintin\u0027, \u0027Let\u0027s go huntin\u0027—let\u0027s go huntin\u0027,\u0027 and one night pop could not resist it any longer. So after everybody\u0027d gone to bed, he got up, sneaked down stairs into the parlor, took down the gun from the bricky-brack rack, and set out for the lonely woods. \"\u0027If I don\u0027t kill nothin\u0027,\u0027 he said to himself, \u0027I\u0027ll get home before they wake up; and if I do kill somethin\u0027, pa will be so pleased an\u0027 proud he\u0027ll forgive me.\u0027 He little thought then he was leavin\u0027 home forever. He opened the door softly, an\u0027 in half an hour he was off on the mountain, \u0027longside of a great big lake. Pretty soon he heard a sound, and through the darkness he see two big eyes, flamin\u0027 like fire,[Pg 85] a-lookin\u0027 at where he was. It was that moose up there as was a-lookin\u0027 at him. For a minute he was scart to death, but he soon recovered, upped with his gun, an\u0027 fired—only he was too excited, and he didn\u0027t do any more than graze the moose\u0027s cheek. You can\u0027t see the scar. It\u0027s been mended. It was a tarrable exciting moment, for in a jiffy the moose was after him, head down. Pop tried to run, but couldn\u0027t. He stumbled, an\u0027 just as he stumbled he felt the big moose\u0027s breath hot on the back of his neck. He thought he was a goner for sure; but he wasn\u0027t, as it turned out, for as he rolled over and the moose tried to butt him to death, pop grabbed holt of his horns, and the first toss of his head the moose gave landed pop right between \u0027em, sittin\u0027 down as comfortably fixed as though he was in a rockin\u0027-chair. If you\u0027ll look at the antlers you\u0027ll see how there\u0027s a place in between \u0027em scooped out just right for a small boy to sit in. That\u0027s where pop sat, hangin\u0027 on to those two upper prongs, with, his legs dangling down over the moose\u0027s cheeks.\" \"Phe-e-e-ew!\" whispered Bob. \"He was in a fix, wasn\u0027t he? What did the moose do?\" \"Him?\" said Sandboys. \"He was absolutely flummoxed for a minute, and then he began to run. Pop held on. He had to. He didn\u0027t want to go travellin\u0027, but there warn\u0027t anything else he could do, so he kept holt. That moose run steady for three days, down over the Canadian border into Maine, takin\u0027 a short-cut over Maine into New Hampshire, droppin\u0027 dead with weariness two miles from Littleton, where I cum from. That let pop out. The moose was dead, and he wasn\u0027t afraid any more; so he climbed down, walked into Littleton, and sold the animal\u0027s carkiss to a man there, who cut off its head, and sent it up here to this hotel, an\u0027 it\u0027s been here ever since. Pop took the money and tried to get back home with it; but there wasn\u0027t enough, so he worked about Littleton until he had enough; and just then he met my mother, fell in love with her, married her, and settled down right there; and that\u0027s how it is that that moose-head is responsible for my bein\u0027 here. If the animal hadn\u0027t run away with dad, he\u0027d never have met my mother, and I\u0027d have been nowhere.\" \"It\u0027s very interesting,\" said Bob. \"But I should think he\u0027d have sent word to his father that he was all right.\" \"Oh, he did,\" said Sandboys; \"and a year or two later the whole family came down and joined him, leavin\u0027 Canady and its French names forever.\" And here the narrative, which might have been much longer, stopped, for the cross old lady near the elevator sent word that that \"talkin\u0027 must stop,\" because while it was \"goin\u0027 on\" she \"couldn\u0027t hear what tune it was the trumpeter was blowin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3322/90995.html","bookId":393,"book":{"id":393,"title":"Harper\u0027s Round Table, November 24, 1896","description":"简介： The Editor of the Round Table has asked me to relate some incident of my life which may be of interest to its readers.
