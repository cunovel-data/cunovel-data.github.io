{"id":40018,"no":10,"title":"OLD-TIME THANKSGIVING.","content":"BY M. L. VAN VORST. Come, will you help me harness the bay? Come, will you help me hitch up the gray? Grandfather\u0027s lent us the great big sleigh. Hip hurrah for Thanksgiving-time! Chestnuts and cider and fire\u0027s glow, Five good miles through the woods to go, Clear cold winds and a driving snow. Hip hurrah for the bells achime! Fly by the hedge of the country-side, By the gleaming fields and the farm-lands wide. Hey for the boys and the girls as they ride! Hip hurrah for the gray and the bay! Snow-wreaths hang on the fir and pine, And the bells are ringing like silver fine; Bright cheeks are glowing and bright eyes shine. Hip hurrah for the jolly sleigh! Come, will you go with us, one and all, To the games and romps in the country hall, Where the rafters ring with our shout and call? Hip hurrah for the fun and cheer! Months of the holly and mistletoe We would hold you fast, for we love you so. Thanksgiving and Christmas and sparkling snow Gladden the days of the dying year. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3322/91000.html","bookId":393,"book":{"id":393,"title":"Harper\u0027s Round Table, November 24, 1896","description":"简介： The Editor of the Round Table has asked me to relate some incident of my life which may be of interest to its readers.
