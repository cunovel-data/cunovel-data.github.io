Cassie hurried out of Adam\u0027s house in a panic and headed straight to Diana\u0027s. Diana would know what to do.\\n\\n She banged on the glossy front door of Diana\u0027s lemon-yellow house, but nobody answered. Not again, Cassie thought. She was ready to do another unlocking spell when she tried the nickel handle. It clicked easily beneath her thumb. The door was unlocked. Cassie stepped inside the house\u0027s slick foyer and called Diana\u0027s name. Her voice echoed off the polished mantel and brass knickknacks.\\n\\n There was no answer, but the thumping bass of too-loud music echoed from Diana\u0027s bedroom. That explained why she hadn\u0027t heard Cassie knocking. Cassie made her way up to Diana\u0027s room and pushed open her door.\\n\\n \"Diana?\" she said, as the image before her registered. Diana wasn\u0027t alone. She was on the bed with -\\n\\n \"Oh my God.\" It was Max. And he was kissing Diana. And she was kissing him back.\\n\\n \"Cassie!\" Diana screamed, pulling away from Max hastily. \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n \"The door was open,\" Cassie stuttered. \"I tried knocking, but - I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n Max jumped from the bed to a standing position and in one quick motion turned off the music. \"It\u0027s not what it looks like,\" he said. He was up on the balls of his feet and his tanned calves were flexed, like he was poised to sidestep the rush of a full-on attack.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay.\" Diana looked sympathetically at Max. \"It was only a matter of time before someone found us out. At least it\u0027s Cassie.\"\\n\\n Max settled back on his heels and ran his hands through his hair. Then he dug around on the floor for his socks and sneakers. \"You two probably need to talk,\" he said in a voice that sounded like an apology. \"I should go.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to leave,\" Diana said to him, softly. \"Just give us a minute.\"\\n\\n Cassie stepped aside as Max staggered toward the doorway, avoiding her eyes. \"I\u0027ll be downstairs.\" He closed the door behind him, and Cassie turned to Diana.\\n\\n \"Please let me explain,\" Diana said, without giving Cassie a chance to react.\\n\\n Cassie didn\u0027t know what to say. She needed to tell Diana about Adam going to the Mission House - it was a matter of life and death. But before she could get out even one word, Diana broke into tears.\\n\\n \"This secret has been killing me.\" Diana\u0027s emerald-green eyes grew pink with emotion. \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t tell you. I just ... I knew it would be hard for anyone to understand.\"\\n\\n Cassie sat down on the soft-feathered bedspread across from Diana and let her talk. She\u0027d obviously been holding this in for a while and needed to get a lot off her chest.\\n\\n \"When I started spending time with Max,\" Diana said, \"I found myself really liking him. It might not seem like it, Cassie, but he\u0027s charming, and sweet. And despite how he sometimes acts in school, he doesn\u0027t care what anyone else thinks.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t doubt it.\" Cassie tried to sound objective and unprejudiced. \"But Max is our enemy. He marked Faye himself and his people killed Constance and Portia. He must know you\u0027re a witch, too.\"\\n\\n Diana nodded, starting to sob. \"I know that. I haven\u0027t forgotten all that he\u0027s done to us. But the cord? The connection that you and Adam have? I\u0027ve seen that between me and Max.\"\\n\\n Cassie swallowed the lump in her throat that formed at the mention of the silver cord. They seemed to be popping up everywhere lately. \"Are you sure?\" she asked.\\n\\n Diana was crying so hard, Cassie knew she couldn\u0027t be mistaken.\\n\\n \"You of all people must understand,\" Diana begged. \"You can\u0027t always choose who you fall for.\"\\n\\n Cassie recognized that Diana never would have chosen this path if she\u0027d had a choice. She felt sorry for her in a way. It couldn\u0027t be easy, falling in love with your sworn enemy.\\n\\n Cassie rubbed Diana\u0027s back in gentle circles. \"I don\u0027t blame you for falling for him. He\u0027s gorgeous and he\u0027s loved you since the first time he saw you. But I guess it\u0027s hard for me to understand exactly how this happened.\"\\n\\n Diana reached for a tissue to wipe her tear-muddled face. \"When I was trying to spend time with him, to spy on him, I got to see what it was actually like to be him. How he\u0027s had to move around from place to place his entire life chasing witches with his awful father. How he has no mom, no siblings. Just like so many of us, Cassie.\"\\n\\n Diana plucked a fresh Kleenex from the box and dabbed her eyes. \"It\u0027s so hard for him to trust people. He\u0027s scared and alone. Do you know how that started to feel? To trick this really good guy into believing I had no ulterior motives for spending time with him?\"\\n\\n Diana didn\u0027t wait for Cassie to answer. \"And then one day we were hanging out in his room and his father came home early. The moment the front door slammed, Max turned to me, terrified. He grabbed my hand and led me to the window and I realized it was me he was worried about, not himself. We climbed out his window and dashed for the woods behind his house. We were barefoot, with our shoes in our hands, and rocks and twigs cut up the bottoms of our muddied feet, but we didn\u0027t stop. Long after it was obvious we were safe, Max was still clutching my hand, pulling me along, until finally I couldn\u0027t go on. I stopped, breathless, and asked him why we were still running. And that was when he kissed me for the first time. He leaned in and placed his lips on mine, and a wave of energy passed through me like nothing I\u0027d ever felt before. He said, \u0027I want to keep running until we\u0027re free.\u0027 And it was as if I were suddenly floating outside myself. I could see the two of us standing there in the woods and how we were connected by a band of energy - a silver cord that hummed and sang and bound us heart to heart. And I understood that it could never be broken, that our lives were linked.\"\\n\\n Cassie remained silent, looking at Diana with sympathetic eyes.\\n\\n \"I know it sounds crazy,\" Diana said, \"but I trust him, Cassie. He wouldn\u0027t do anything to hurt me.\"\\n\\n \"If you trust him,\" Cassie said, \"I trust you. But as things progress, it\u0027s likely there will be a battle between us and them. You understand that, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" Diana exhaled deeply. \"It\u0027s practically all I can think about. But until we get to that point, can I ask you to keep this between us?\"\\n\\n Cassie wanted to be supportive, but she worried about the position Diana was now in. She would be torn between her love for Max and her devotion to the Circle, and Cassie knew how powerful the draw of true love could be.\\n\\n \"Let me ask you an important question,\" Cassie said. \"And I need you to tell me the truth. Is there any chance your loyalties will be skewed when it comes time to fight?\"\\n\\n \"There is absolutely no chance of that happening.\" Diana had stopped crying, but her eyes remained puffy and red. \"I assure you. My allegiance will always remain with the Circle, even if it kills me. I\u0027m just not ready for them to hear about this yet. Please.\"\\n\\n Diana sounded pretty convincing. And she was right that the Circle would never understand how she could possibly be in love with Max.\\n\\n \"Your secret is safe with me,\" Cassie said. \"But we\u0027re not done talking about this.\"\\n\\n Then Cassie stood up to leave. All this talk about cords and irresistible connections was making her even more nervous about Adam. But she didn\u0027t want to risk explaining the Adam situation to Diana with Max so close by.\\n\\n \"Wait.\" Diana followed Cassie toward the door when she realized she was leaving. \"Didn\u0027t you need me for something?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing important,\" Cassie said. \"Never mind.\"\\n\\n She would have to go after Adam alone. But she had to go now, before it was too late. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-16.html","bookId":2099,"book":{"id":2099,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Hunt (The Secret Circle #5)","description":"Storyline: For Cassie and her Circle of witches, it\u0027s hard to imagine life in New Salem getting any worse.
