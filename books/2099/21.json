It was an impossibly sunny day, which only made Cassie feel guilty that she could enjoy it when Suzan couldn\u0027t. Suzan had been such a lighthearted person, always able to find the fun in any situation. How was it possible that they could all be standing here now beneath the bright sun, while Suzan would be buried beneath heavy black dirt? It wasn\u0027t fair, and nothing anyone said would make sense of it.\n The graveyard was mostly flat, comprised of a few small ponds and crooked streams. The jagged coastline was visible in the distance to the east. To the west were wooded, rolling hills. And prevailing over all of it were the granite cliffs in the far north. This was a beautiful place. Why were such wonders made so much more visible by death and loss? Was that why tragedies happened? To open our eyes to the miraculous, to force us to appreciate joy?\n Only Deborah had the courage to say a brief eulogy over Suzan\u0027s casket, to reach for a few words that might capture what the whole Circle was feeling. She cleared her throat and looked affectionately at Suzan\u0027s father.\n \"Suzan was easy to underestimate,\" she said, and a few people giggled. \"In fact, Suzan wanted you to underestimate her, so she could later surprise you with her wit and intelligence, her goodness, her generosity, and let\u0027s not forget, her sarcasm. Beneath all her fancy clothes and makeup, Suzan was a pure soul.\" Deborah was choking back tears now. \"She was pure through and through. And we\u0027re all going to miss her very much.\"\n They all began to cry, but Faye was the most distraught of all. She could barely keep herself upright, she was so overcome with grief. To keep her sobbing from disrupting the ceremony, she staggered off to the side to lean against a barren tree.\n Cassie went to her. She approached her the way she would have approached an injured street cat, with carefulness and caution, fully prepared to back off if necessary. She tried putting her arm around her, but Faye immediately pushed her away. \"I don\u0027t want your pity. Just leave me alone.\"\n \"Faye,\" Cassie said. \"None of this is your fault. You can\u0027t be blaming yourself.\"\n Faye stared viciously at the ground. \"It should have been me. I wish it was me in that box right now.\"\n \"Faye.\"\n \"No, Cassie. It\u0027s easy for you to say it\u0027s nobody\u0027s fault. You saved the day. You\u0027re the hero. But I\u0027m the reason Suzan was on that roof to begin with. And then she threw herself in front of the killing curse to save me. So don\u0027t stand there and try to make me feel better. I don\u0027t deserve it.\"\n Cassie could understand the sentiment. She didn\u0027t want to feel better either. And if Faye wished to punish herself, there was nothing Cassie could do to convince her otherwise. She took a step closer to Faye but didn\u0027t attempt to touch her this time. She just stood near her quietly and respectfully, hoping at the very least to make Faye feel less alone in her remorse.\n They watched the remainder of the service together from afar. After the casket was lowered into the ground, there was nothing left for anyone to do but file back to their cars.\n Cassie took Faye\u0027s hand and guided her across the grass to the rest of the group. With her other hand, she reached for Adam. Together, the eleven of them walked solemnly across the graveyard, but Cassie felt as if each step took them further away from one another. This devastation had broken their bond and weakened their allegiance.\n Then Cassie looked down at her and Adam\u0027s intertwined fingers. She willed it to be there. The silver cord. But nothing appeared.\n The town of New Salem oddly came to life around funerals. People Cassie had never even seen before poured into Suzan\u0027s house with flowers and food for Suzan\u0027s dad. He was polite, but dazed. It might take weeks for the reality of Suzan\u0027s death to actually hit him. Cassie wished she could go to him now and offer him some kind of explanation for what had happened to his little girl. He must have so many questions. But Cassie restrained herself. It was probably better to leave those things unsaid. None of it really added up to an explanation anyhow.\n Diana huddled close to Cassie and whispered in her ear. \"See those?\" she said, pointing to a bouquet of lilies. \"They\u0027re from Max.\"\n Cassie could see Diana was hurting. Not having Max nearby when she needed him the most couldn\u0027t have been easy. This day would have been impossible for Cassie to endure without Adam. But then again, Adam wasn\u0027t the Circle\u0027s sworn enemy.\n Diana touched one of the lilies longingly. \"I broke it off with him, you know.\"\n Cassie tried not to appear relieved.\n \"After what happened with Suzan, I realized how dangerous it really was,\" Diana continued. \"I told him I needed to stand with my Circle.\"\n \"And he\u0027s okay with that?\"\n \"He doesn\u0027t have a choice,\" Diana said, but she gazed around the room as if she were still hoping Max might step inside at any moment.\n Cassie could relate. She had given up Adam once for the good of the Circle and her friendship with Diana. She searched her mind for the right thing to say. Max hadn\u0027t been on the roof the night of their battle, so maybe he wasn\u0027t so bad after all - maybe he was having second thoughts about being a hunter. But Cassie still couldn\u0027t ignore the facts: It was Max who\u0027d marked Faye. It was Max\u0027s father who\u0027d killed Suzan - Suzan, who they\u0027d just buried less than an hour before. Cassie couldn\u0027t help but be glad Diana had broken up with him, at least for the time being.\n \"Look, Diana,\" Cassie said. \"None of us knows what the future holds. What\u0027s going to happen between you and Max down the road isn\u0027t something we can predict. But today, you have your friends. And we\u0027re here for you - we have to be, now more than ever.\"\n \"You\u0027re right. And I\u0027m grateful. Believe me, I am.\" Diana paused. \"It\u0027s just that sometimes I wish everything could just be normal. Do you know what I mean?\"\n \"Well,\" Cassie said, looking over at Adam. He was greeting strangers at the door, thanking them for their casseroles and flowers, directing them toward the sitting room. He was always the helper, always the gentle knight. How could Cassie judge Diana harshly for choosing a complicated person to love, when she knew it was hardly a choice at all?\n \"You know what I think?\" Cassie put her arm around Diana and brought her in for a hug. \"I think sometimes, normal is overrated.\"\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-21.html","bookId":2099,"book":{"id":2099,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Hunt (The Secret Circle #5)","description":"Storyline: \n For Cassie and her Circle of witches, it\u0027s hard to imagine life in New Salem getting any worse.
