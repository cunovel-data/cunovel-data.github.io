{"id":90785,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Pink and white banners advertising the spring dance hung on all four walls of the school cafeteria. On a different day, or maybe in a different life, Cassie would have been excited for the dance. But this afternoon\u0027s lunch was going to be all business. Suzan arrived a few minutes after the others and dropped her tray on the table with enthusiasm, seemingly oblivious to the group\u0027s mood. \"Is it that time already? We have to go shopping before all the good dresses disappear.\"\n \"Is that seriously what\u0027s on your mind right now?\" Melanie said, her mouth half full. \"A stupid dance?\"\n Suzan crossed her arms over her cerulean blouse. \"We\u0027re supposed to act normal, right? So we don\u0027t seem suspicious to the principal or anyone else. I\u0027m just acting normal.\"\n \"You can act however you want, as long as you don\u0027t perform any magic,\" Cassie announced. \"The principal knows who we are. We confirmed that this morning.\"\n Suzan took a seat between Faye and Deborah. \"Oh.\" She pushed her tray away dejectedly. \"Nobody told me. I\u0027m always the last to know everything.\"\n Cassie looked around the table at her friends. Of course the hunters had figured them out. Not only were they always together, but none of them seemed average, even when they were alone. Adam and Nick, the Henderson brothers, and even Sean carried themselves with a pride and independence that set them apart from other guys at school. Their fellow students were terrified and awestruck by them. It was no different for the girls. Diana was the most admired, and Faye the most feared - but Laurel, Melanie, Deborah, and Suzan were no less intriguing to their classmates. Something about them sparkled. They were unlike all the other girls in school; their problems were so much larger than boys and clothes. It was stupid of Cassie to assume any of them could have remained unrecognized by the hunters.\n \"After what happened earlier today,\" Diana said quietly, \"school is no longer safe for those of us who\u0027ve been marked.\" She\u0027d directed the comment at Laurel, but Laurel just played with her sandwich, not eating and not looking up. Cassie had never seen her this depressed, even when the hunters first burned their symbol onto her front lawn.\n Faye also pretended not to hear Diana\u0027s warning. She refused to acknowledge that she\u0027d been marked at all. Cassie noticed she was still wearing the opal necklace Max had given her, the one he\u0027d stamped with the hunter symbol.\n \"You can take that off,\" Cassie said, pointing to the necklace. \"You don\u0027t have to keep wearing it like some kind of scarlet letter.\"\n Faye shook her head. \"I\u0027m not about to let on that I know about the mark. He\u0027s not the only one who can pretend to be someone he\u0027s not.\"\n Deborah nodded, pointing her plastic fork at Faye like a spear. \"You should give him a taste of his own medicine. Max played you, and now you have to turn it around on him.\"\n \"There he is.\" Sean shifted his beady eyes across the cafeteria toward Max, and Faye quickly applied a fresh coat of red gloss to her lips.\n \"Do you honestly think revenge is the best idea right now?\" Diana asked. \"We\u0027ve already had one close call with a hunter today. We don\u0027t need another.\"\n \"Relax, D.\" Faye curled her lips into a smile. \"We need information on the hunters and he\u0027s our way to it. I\u0027m going to pump him for intel, double agent - style. Watch and learn.\"\n Without another word, Faye stood up and jogged over to Max, meeting him halfway as he approached. He was dressed to go to lacrosse practice and carried a duffel bag. Faye took the bag from him, dropped it to her side, and pretended to be just as in love with him as ever. She pulled him in close and kissed him passionately on the mouth. \"I\u0027ve missed you,\" she said, loud enough for the Circle to hear.\n Max touched his fingers to his lips, now lightly coated in the same red gloss as Faye\u0027s. \"And I missed you,\" he said.\n Max was tall and muscular with light brown hair. His voice was rugged, and he wore a perpetual cocky grin. He was just the kind of guy that made Faye swoon. It\u0027s no wonder she\u0027d let her guard down enough to get marked by him.\n The rest of the Circle watched as Faye whispered into Max\u0027s ear and he murmured back to her in a soft voice.\n \"Do you think he\u0027s falling for it?\" Sean asked.\n \"Seems like it,\" Doug said, nodding his wild head of blond hair. \"He\u0027s acting the same as before. Like a lovesick wimp.\"\n \"But who knows if she\u0027ll be able to get any information out of him,\" his twin brother said.\n Melanie was dubious, as usual. \"There\u0027s no way he\u0027s going to give up anything on the hunters. Whether he thinks Faye\u0027s on to him or not, he\u0027s not stupid.\"\n \"But Faye might be able to trick him into leading us to more of them,\" Nick said. He was sitting on the cafeteria table, bent over with his feet on a chair. \"There have to be more hunters in town than just Max and his dad.\"\n Melanie rolled her gray eyes. \"Yeah, I\u0027m sure Max will be happy to introduce us to all his hunter buddies. Maybe he\u0027ll even host a cocktail party.\"\n Cassie continued watching Max and Faye\u0027s back-and-forth. It was almost comical, both of them pretending to be into the other when they were actually sworn enemies. But Max\u0027s face betrayed nothing more than he intended it to. He was running this show and Cassie could see he was too good at it to crack under a little pressure.\n After a few minutes of the charade, Faye finally gave up. She leaned in and kissed Max one last time before returning to the group. Max waved as he passed them on his way to the gym, flashing his perfect smile - but Cassie thought it looked like he was grinning at Diana in particular.\n \"Well, that was a bust,\" Faye said. \"He\u0027s either a really good actor or he doesn\u0027t know anything about what happened earlier in the principal\u0027s office. I mentioned my friend Laurel and he asked which one she was.\"\n \"We still shouldn\u0027t push our luck,\" Diana said. \"I think it\u0027s time for you to distance yourself from him and his dad.\"\n \"I think Diana\u0027s right,\" Cassie said. \"We need to lay down some new rules.\"\n \"Just what this Circle needs.\" Faye returned to her seat at the table. \"More rules.\"\n \"What do you propose?\" Diana asked, speaking over Faye. \"We\u0027re listening.\"\n Cassie realized she had the whole group\u0027s attention. They watched her hopefully, like she might have some secret panacea to solve all their problems. She cleared her throat and tried to think of something fast.\n \"Well, we know the hunters can\u0027t mark someone without witnessing them doing magic. But once they\u0027re marked, the next step is the killing curse, which means death. Ultimate death.\"\n \"Is this supposed to be a pep talk?\" Sean called out.\n \"Let her finish.\" Nick glared at Sean with a deep mahogany stare.\n \"I think we need to enact a buddy system. One hunter can\u0027t perform the killing curse on a witch alone. The best thing we can do is make sure we\u0027re not alone either,\" Cassie said.\n Deborah let out a whoop of laughter. \"That\u0027s your big idea? For us to hold hands in the hallway like preschoolers?\"\n \"I never said it was a big idea,\" Cassie said defensively. \"It just makes sense for those of us who are marked to be with another Circle member at all times. Including overnight.\"\n Faye\u0027s honey-colored eyes blazed. \"No way. I won\u0027t agree to having a babysitter. I\u0027d rather die.\"\n \"You just might die if you don\u0027t agree to this,\" Melanie said. \"It\u0027s the only way we can be sure you and Laurel remain safe.\"\n Laurel looked up from her untouched lunch. She didn\u0027t appear any more eager than Faye to accept this new rule. \"But Cassie, you said before that you\u0027ve been talking to your mom about your father, and that you\u0027re learning ancient things that could help us.\"\n Cassie felt herself tense up. She could sense Adam\u0027s cavernous eyes watching her, and she swore she could actually hear Diana\u0027s jaw unhinge before any words escaped her mouth.\n \"What ancient things?\" Diana asked, with a hint of suspicion in her voice.\n The entire cafeteria seemed to fall silent and Cassie shifted uncomfortably. \"I was just telling Laurel that my father once saved someone who was marked. I\u0027m trying to learn more about how he did it.\"\n Diana furrowed her brow at Cassie\u0027s discomfort. She was unwilling to let the matter drop. \"Do you think he used something similar to the witch-hunter curse we memorized from my Book of Shadows?\"\n \"Probably something like that,\" Cassie said, trying to sound nonchalant and upbeat.\n \"Why don\u0027t we just use the witch-hunter curse from Diana\u0027s book now? We know Max and his dad are hunters,\" Suzan said. \"I don\u0027t understand what we\u0027re waiting for.\"\n \"I second that,\" Nick said.\n Diana released a frustrated breath. They\u0027d been over this before. \"Because this is our chance to use the hunters\u0027 ignorance for more information. We still have surprise on our side. They don\u0027t know we know who they are. And we also don\u0027t know for sure how that curse works, or what it\u0027ll do. It\u0027s a very rough translation, so it\u0027s our absolute last resort. If we try it and it doesn\u0027t work, then we\u0027ll all be marked in a matter of seconds.\"\n \"In other words,\" Faye said, \"we have no clue if those words we memorized are a witch-hunter curse or a fairy tale.\"\n Diana was quiet for a few seconds. She chewed on her lip nervously.\n \"We can\u0027t rely on that mediocre, pieced-together translation from Diana\u0027s book,\" Adam said. \"No offense to you, Diana, but whatever curse Black John used, that\u0027s the one we want when we go up against the hunters.\"\n Diana nodded and looked down at her hands. Adam turned to Cassie. She could tell he was struggling to restrain himself from telling the group about Black John\u0027s book, but she also knew he\u0027d never betray her trust, no matter how difficult it was for him.\n \"What about the protection spell?\" Laurel asked. \"Shouldn\u0027t that keep me and Faye safe enough so we can at least continue leading normal lives?\"\n \"It seems to be intact.\" Diana raised her head, hesitantly. \"But we don\u0027t know how long it\u0027ll last. That spell is kind of a one-shot deal, and once it wears off, that\u0027s it.\"\n \"And,\" Melanie said, \"even if it does last, we can\u0027t be sure it\u0027s strong enough against the hunter\u0027s killing curse. It probably isn\u0027t.\"\n Faye stared off into space, for once too upset to argue.\n Cassie momentarily considered her own situation. If the protection spell wore off, she\u0027d really be powerless against Scarlett. As it was, she was jumping at every shadow and freezing up at the sight of every redhead who walked by.\n \"How are you going to do it?\" Faye called out to Cassie, like she\u0027d just snapped out of a daydream. \"How do you plan to figure out the curse Black John used?\"\n Cassie glanced at Adam, but his expression kept her secret safely hidden.\n \"I\u0027m trying to learn what I can from my mother,\" Cassie said. \"She\u0027s blocked out a lot of the past, but when I get her talking sometimes things come to light.\"\n It was a good answer for being put on the spot, and even true. But Cassie knew it would take more to save her friends and defeat the hunters than simply getting her mother to talk about the past. She had to get her father\u0027s book back. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-3.html","bookId":2099,"book":{"id":2099,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Hunt (The Secret Circle #5)","description":"Storyline: \n For Cassie and her Circle of witches, it\u0027s hard to imagine life in New Salem getting any worse.
