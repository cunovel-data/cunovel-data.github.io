{"id":90800,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\"Cassie!\" Adam screamed. \"Your eyes. You have to stop!\"\n Cassie heard Adam\u0027s cries, but couldn\u0027t register their meaning. All she could see was the image of Scarlett in front of her, dead.\n \"You\u0027re going to kill her!\" Adam screamed, just before Cassie could speak the words that would murder her sister.\n Cassie sputtered, confused, as if Adam had finally shaken her awake from a nightmare.\n \"It\u0027s Black John. It\u0027s the darkness controlling you,\" Adam said. \"This isn\u0027t you, Cassie.\"\n Cassie gazed around the room like she\u0027d never seen it before, and then at Scarlett, who was dying at her feet.\n Cassie felt her own insides cave in. Her legs went soft, and she felt light-headed. Adam was right. This wasn\u0027t her.\n She carefully set her father\u0027s Book of Shadows on the table and backed away from it with caution. Then she looked at Adam. \"What have I done?\"\n Some of the color returned to Adam\u0027s face and his shoulders settled. \"Not what you almost did, thank goodness.\" He took a deep breath. \"I thought I\u0027d lost you for good.\"\n Cassie ran to Adam and wrapped her arms around him.\n \"There\u0027s a better way to deal with Scarlett,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll figure out what it is together. But you have to untie me first.\"\n Cassie\u0027s first instinct was to use magic to set Adam free, but then she thought better of it. She untied him the old-fashioned way, tugging and untwisting the ropy threads confining him to the chair until he was free.\n Adam stood up and stretched his legs. He rubbed his sore, rope-burned wrists. \"Where did you learn all those dark spells?\" he asked. \"Have you been able to translate that much of the book?\"\n \"No. I don\u0027t know,\" Cassie said. \"They just came to me.\"\n \"What do you mean, they just came to you? Like from inside you? Your eyes were as black as marbles.\"\n \"Adam, I don\u0027t know. Can we just focus on Scarlett right now?\" Scarlett was still lying motionless on the floor, gray and desiccated.\n \"Will she be okay?\" Adam asked.\n \"I think so,\" Cassie said. \"But I can also do a reversal spell.\"\n Adam considered their options for a minute. \"Before she can move again,\" he said, \"there\u0027s another spell I think we should try. It\u0027ll prevent her from ever returning to New Salem. What do you think? Are you up for it?\"\n \"A magical restraining order,\" Cassie said. \"That sounds great, but I don\u0027t think our regular magic is strong enough to work on her.\"\n \"It will be.\" Adam nodded toward the closet.\n The Master Tools. Of course. In all the commotion, Cassie had almost forgotten about them.\n Cassie stepped around Scarlett to open the closet\u0027s folding doors. She rummaged through some junk on the floor and moved around some boxes on a high shelf, and there they were. Just sitting there for the taking. The silver bracelet, the leather garter, and the sparkling diadem.\n Cassie reached for each one individually. First the bracelet. She fastened it around her upper arm. Its smooth silver felt cool against her skin. Next she secured the soft leather garter on her thigh. Adam came up behind her as she reached for the diadem. He straightened it on her head for her.\n \"Now that\u0027s more like it,\" he said. \"That\u0027s the Cassie I know and love.\"\n Cassie tried to soak up the positive energy from each Tool - to feel like the Cassie Adam knew and loved. She tried her best to smile.\n \"I feel good,\" she said. \"Better.\" Then she looked at Scarlett. \"Let\u0027s try the restraining spell.\"\n \"We\u0027ll need a few things first.\" Adam hurried around the house, searching for supplies, digging through a few different drawers and cabinets. \"I\u0027ll be right back,\" he said, and ran out to the front yard.\n Cassie had a few moments to think about what she\u0027d just been through. She\u0027d come so close to killing her sister. How could Adam ever look at her the same way? How could she wear the Master Tools now, or ever be worthy of them again?\n Adam returned from outside, rosy cheeked and with a fistful of dirt. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s give this spell a try.\"\n He bent down to Scarlett and guided Cassie\u0027s hand to Scarlett\u0027s forehead. \"You hold her here and concentrate. It\u0027s important that your intentions remain clear, Cassie, can you do that?\"\n \"Yes,\" Cassie said easily. But she knew she would really have to try.\n Scarlett\u0027s forehead was cold and hard; it was almost like touching a corpse. Adam lit a candle and swung it above Scarlett\u0027s body, back and forth from the top of her head, down to the bottoms of her feet. Then he recited the chant. \"I banish you from New Salem, Scarlett, with the power of fire.\"\n Cassie imagined a soothing white light. She pictured it growing brighter and more intense until it had enveloped not only Scarlett but herself and Adam as well.\n Adam secured the lit candle in a holder upon the floor, just north of Scarlett\u0027s head. Then he scattered the fistful of dirt he\u0027d collected from the front yard onto the floor, encircling Scarlett within it. He said, \"I banish you from New Salem, Scarlett, with the power of earth.\"\n Cassie could smell the loamy trail of dirt and was reminded of the elemental wholesomeness of the earth, the cleanliness of stark terrain. She imagined the white light filling the whole room, and then the entire house from the inside out.\n Next Adam reached for a cup of water he\u0027d set on the table. He dipped his hand deep into the cup and then sprinkled drops of water, like rain, over Scarlett\u0027s skin. \"I banish you from New Salem, Scarlett, with the power of water,\" he said.\n Finally Adam went to open the front door of the house and a large window on the opposite side, creating a strong cross-breeze in the main room. The rush of air blew out the candle he\u0027d set on the floor. \"I banish you from New Salem, Scarlett, with the power of air,\" he said.\n He placed his hands gently over Cassie\u0027s, joining her in holding Scarlett\u0027s forehead. He closed his eyes and said, \"Fire, earth, water, and air, and the power of the Master Tools, mote it be.\"\n Scarlett stirred and Adam opened his eyes. \"That\u0027s it,\" he said.\n Cassie let her hands drop to her sides. \"Did it work?\"\n \"We\u0027ll find out,\" Adam said. \"But after all this, I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll be much of a threat anymore.\"\n Cassie nodded, but she wasn\u0027t so sure. She couldn\u0027t imagine a time when Scarlett would no longer be a menace.\n Adam picked up Black John\u0027s Book of Shadows and gestured to the door. \"What do you say we get out of here?\"\n Cassie looked Scarlett over one last time and nodded.\n She went to the front door and put one hand on the knob. With her other hand, she waved her fingers at Scarlett. \"I tollere malum incantatores,\" she said, the words of the reversal spell.\n Scarlett\u0027s color came back and she gasped for breath just as Cassie and Adam stepped outside, slamming the door behind them. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-18.html","bookId":2099,"book":{"id":2099,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Hunt (The Secret Circle #5)","description":"Storyline: \n For Cassie and her Circle of witches, it\u0027s hard to imagine life in New Salem getting any worse.
