Suzan and Deborah set up candles on all four cardinal points: north, south, east, and west. Sean lit their wicks one at a time. Chris and Doug cleansed the air with smoking jasmine censers, while Melanie laid out energy-clearing crystals. Cassie allowed a small part of herself to fill with hope. Maybe they did have enough good magic behind them to stand a chance in this fight. Getting the Master Tools back from Scarlett could change everything.\n Diana and Adam returned from outside with a stone cauldron filled to the brim with seawater. They set it down on the floor, and the group joined hands around it, enclosing it in a circle. Just as they had the last time the Circle performed this spell, they all concentrated on the water - on its clarity and depth, its ability to reshape its form to any container, and its utility as a mirror. Then they invoked the elements.\n \"Power of water, I beseech you,\" Diana said. Together the Circle softly repeated the locator chant four times:\n She who is lost shall now be found\n Hiding places come unbound\n They stared into the cauldron as Diana called out, \"Let the water show the location of Scarlett.\"\n Then they watched, waiting for the images to come.\n Cassie focused hard, directing all her yearning and desire onto the water. She bent her mind, begging it to cooperate. When the first image started to form she felt a gust of energy rush through her.\n It was an old house - seventeenth-century old. And it was surrounded by a heavy iron gate. The house looked like it should have been a museum, no longer suitable to live in, but not unlike many houses in New Salem and on the mainland.\n Then Cassie saw a bridge, but not one she recognized. It could have been any bridge anywhere; nothing about it struck her as unique. It disappeared as quickly as it had appeared.\n Finally a strange picture began coming together on the surface of the water. Bit by bit, a startling portrait came to light: a man with his head and feet locked through holes in a wooden board. His hands were chained behind him. Cassie knew what she was looking at - she\u0027d seen one of these before. It was a prisoner in colonial-era stocks. Then the water turned to a disquieting black.\n Cassie wasn\u0027t sure what to make of the strange series of images. It seemed like the spell hadn\u0027t worked nearly as well as it had the last time. But Adam looked up at the others with understanding in his eyes. \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" he said. \"She\u0027s so close to New Salem.\"\n \"I know that place.\" Nick nodded along. \"It\u0027s the old Stockbridge Mission House, just on the other side of the bridge. It\u0027s supposed to be abandoned, but I guess it\u0027s not anymore.\"\n \"Well, what are we waiting for?\" Faye asked. \"Let\u0027s go get her.\"\n \"Hold on.\" Diana blew out all the candles and snuffed out the incense. \"First we should research what spells would be useful against Scarlett. So we\u0027re at least prepared for a face-off.\"\n Laurel pulled out a notebook and began jotting down a list. \"We should study our defense spells,\" she said. \"And definitely remote summoning spells. Melanie, can you look into what crystals might be of use?\"\n Faye flicked Laurel\u0027s pencil from her fingers. \"Forget all that. We\u0027ve got Cassie.\"\n Cassie looked down at the tattered throw rug, not wanting to acknowledge Faye\u0027s comment. Of course Faye was champing at the bit to attack the hunters. All she cared about was breaking her mark, even if it meant Cassie performing dark magic. But what Faye didn\u0027t understand was the more Cassie used dark magic, the darker she became. Or maybe Faye did understand that, but she was still willing to sacrifice Cassie to the dark side for their cause.\n \"Cassie\u0027s not using black magic when we go up against Scarlett,\" Adam said. \"Under any circumstances. But aside from that, I agree with Faye. We need to act right away, even if we don\u0027t have all the research.\"\n Diana gawked at Adam from across the living room table. \"This isn\u0027t something to rush into,\" she said. \"Need I remind you how in our last battle with Scarlett, she made you blind with a single wave of her hand?\"\n Suzan and Deborah, who were sitting side by side on the sofa, chuckled meanly.\n \"I remember,\" Adam said. \"And it wasn\u0027t just me, it was all of us. But thanks for bringing that up.\"\n Adam turned to Nick for support, assuming they might for once fall on the same side of a dispute. \"Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s do-or-die time?\" Adam said to Nick. \"Study period is over. Am I right?\"\n Cassie\u0027s insides were seething. She wanted to go after Scarlett and get the Master Tools back more than any of them, but deep down she knew what they were up against - she was the only one who really understood what they were up against. It was her responsibility to speak up.\n \"Having learned something from the trap I walked into in Cape Cod,\" she said, \"I don\u0027t want to face Scarlett unprepared. She\u0027s stronger than all of us put together. We got lucky last time - we got her to run away, but we couldn\u0027t overpower her. The only way we stand a chance of defeating her now is by outsmarting her.\"\n Cassie directed her attention to Adam. \"That was a great pep talk and all, but a positive attitude and a whole lot of hope aren\u0027t going to cut it. We need to be realistic. We should have an arsenal of spells at our fingertips before we step through the door of that house. One or two more days of preparation is all we need. It\u0027s not much.\"\n \"I\u0027m with her,\" Deborah said. \"Cassie should be the one calling the shots on this mission.\"\n Nick raised his hand. \"I second that.\"\n Adam\u0027s cheeks turned crimson, and Faye let out a begrudging sigh.\n Laurel picked up her notebook and pencil. \"Okay then. Who has something to add to the list?\"\n Adam lingered at Cassie\u0027s front door, waiting for the others to leave her house with their individual assignments. He tilted his head at her and averted his eyes. \"We should talk,\" he said.\n \"About what?\"\n \"Scarlett.\"\n \"It seems like she\u0027s all you want to talk about lately,\" Cassie said.\n Adam\u0027s coy look changed into something more serious. \"I understand why you\u0027re upset, Cassie. But I didn\u0027t suggest we find Scarlett so I could ask her out to dinner.\" He smiled. \"You know that.\"\n Cassie did know that, but she still resented Scarlett for the stress she was putting on her and Adam\u0027s relationship. And that resentment was transferring directly onto Adam.\n \"That\u0027s all I wanted to say.\" Adam leaned in and gave Cassie a stiff hug good-bye.\n Cassie accepted his hug with limp arms. In her mind, she knew Adam hadn\u0027t done anything wrong, but her heart was proving to be more stubborn. Scarlett and the cord were all she could see when she looked at Adam now, all she could feel when he touched her. No matter how hard she tried to rationalize her jealousy away, it was there.\n After Adam left, Cassie did the only thing she could think of to distract herself from her love life: She started cleaning the kitchen. Her mother would be home soon, and it would be nice for her to return to a spotless house.\n As she was sweeping the kitchen floor, enjoying the trivial sense of control that came from defeating household dirt and grime, Nick climbed up from the basement.\n Cassie gripped her broom handle tightly. \"Going somewhere?\" she asked.\n Nick slipped the broom out of Cassie\u0027s hands. \"Not unless you\u0027re volunteering yourself as an escort.\"\n \"I might be.\" Cassie laughed. \"But not until this floor is clean.\"\n \"In that case, consider it done.\" Nick put his head down and began sweeping the floor with even strokes.\n Cassie watched him, admiring the way he could lose himself so effortlessly in a physical task. Rebuilding engines, wrenching pipes, chopping wood - brute force was where Nick excelled. Fixing things that were broken, or muscling a floor clean if that was all he could get. There was a rugged simplicity to him that Cassie envied.\n Nick stopped sweeping and rested both hands on the broom handle. \"A penny for your thoughts,\" he said.\n \"I should be the one paying you if I start talking.\"\n \"Try me.\" Nick grinned. \"First session is free.\"\n Cassie leaned against the kitchen counter. \"Well, for starters, I\u0027ve been having terrible nightmares.\"\n \"From the book, do you think?\" Nick asked.\n \"I guess. I\u0027ve been having a lot of weird feelings since that book came into my life.\" Cassie paused. \"And things with Adam have gotten pretty messy.\"\n Nick usually flinched every time Cassie said Adam\u0027s name, but he didn\u0027t this time. His mahogany eyes were still and clear and his face was calm. Cassie suddenly felt like she could tell Nick anything and he wouldn\u0027t judge her. She took a step closer to him.\n \"You know the cord?\" she asked. \"The one between me and Adam?\"\n \"The infamous silver cord. Do you even have to ask?\"\n \"Well, there\u0027s another one just like it,\" Cassie said. \"Between Adam and Scarlett.\"\n \"Hmm.\" Nick set the broom aside and crossed his thick arms over his chest.\n \"What do you think that means?\" Cassie asked.\n \"The more important question is what do you think it means?\" Nick\u0027s voice was caring and warm.\n Cassie shook her head. \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\n \"Personally,\" Nick said. He looked pointedly at Cassie. \"I think people pick who they love.\"\n There was a beat of silence between them, a charged moment, and Cassie felt something tremble inside her. Something uncontrollable. A heat.\n Without thinking, she took Nick\u0027s face into her hands and kissed him. It was urgent, and passionate, nothing like her soft kisses with Adam. She was hungry in a way she didn\u0027t know she was capable of. But at the same time she felt disconnected, the way she had felt in her bedroom that night with Adam, after touching the book. It was like her mind and her body had split. She wanted to stop, but she couldn\u0027t, so she kept kissing Nick until he pulled away.\n He brought his fingers to his lips in shock. \"What the heck was that?\"\n Cassie was just as stunned as he was. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Don\u0027t do that unless you mean it.\" Nick\u0027s eyes blazed at her, and the air between them still felt charged. Cassie knew if she didn\u0027t walk away now she was going to do something she might really regret. She turned and ran up the stairs to her bedroom, securing the door behind her.\n Cassie wasn\u0027t sure what to make of what had just happened. She hadn\u0027t known she was going to kiss Nick until she was already kissing him. In the moment, the thrill of it had rushed through her whole body. The screaming black hunger from deep in her gut was satiated - it had gotten what it wanted - but now all Cassie felt was empty. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-14.html","bookId":2099,"book":{"id":2099,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Hunt (The Secret Circle #5)","description":"Storyline: \n For Cassie and her Circle of witches, it\u0027s hard to imagine life in New Salem getting any worse.
