{"id":90789,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"For a dance in the school gymnasium, the Spring Fling wasn\u0027t bad. The walls were camouflaged with cheerful decorations and multicolored streamers. Twinkling lights hung from the ceiling like shooting stars. The basketball hoops were tied back and filled with bright, pungent flowers - primroses, tulips, and chrysanthemums - masking the smell of adolescent sweat. The gym had been completely transformed. As promised, Adam had matched his bow tie to Cassie\u0027s pink halter dress perfectly. She fiddled with its knot now, straightening it solely as an excuse to touch him. \"Would you get me a glass of punch?\" she asked. \"Or else I might have to start kissing you.\" Adam grinned. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" Cassie stood alone for a moment and gazed around the gymnasium. Everyone from the Circle had come except for Faye and Laurel, and Melanie, who thought Laurel would need moral support being cooped up with Faye. Cassie thought about giving them a call to check in and see how they were doing, but then Nick appeared before her. \"You look beautiful,\" he said. He\u0027d caught Cassie by surprise, so she laughed, embarrassed. \"Thank you. You don\u0027t look half bad yourself.\" Nick stared down at himself, wearing his regular jeans, T-shirt, and leather jacket. \"I didn\u0027t really dress for the occasion,\" he said. \"But this is a clean shirt, so I guess that\u0027s something.\" Cassie laughed again and a sudden warmth came to her cheeks. \"Do you feel like dancing?\" Nick asked. Cassie hesitated. An air of mischief crept into Nick\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m only asking because I know you, Cassie Blake, came here with a very specific mission to have some fun tonight. I couldn\u0027t let you go home a failure.\" \"Then how could I possibly say no?\" Cassie allowed Nick to lead her onto the dance floor. Whatever song the band was playing was loud and boisterous, nothing Cassie recognized, but it felt good to let her guard down and just enjoy the music - to enjoy the simple pleasure of being a girl at a dance. Nick skipped and bopped about trying to amuse her. She knew he actually hated dancing and that this was all for her benefit. Cassie appreciated the effort and followed his lead, synchronizing her steps to his until together they were making quite a scene. From the dance floor Cassie saw that Adam had returned with her punch, and Diana was behind him with a glass for herself. Nick dashed for them, took the cups from their hands to set them aside, and then pulled them onto the dance floor, too. Deborah and Suzan were quick to join in, and before Cassie knew it, Nick had single-handedly altered the energy of the whole group. They were all being silly, rambunctiously bumping into their classmates on the dance floor, infuriating them in the process. It made Cassie remember when she and Nick were together, and how sometimes his refusal to take anything seriously was just the thing she needed to get out of her own head and start having a good time. Then the music changed to a slow song - one of Cassie\u0027s favorites. She looked at Adam, hoping he would ask her to dance, but she noticed his attention was elsewhere. He was watching someone. \"Max is here,\" he said. \"Act natural.\" \"Whatever that means,\" Nick mumbled under his breath. He turned around and cut through the crowd toward the punch bowl. Their merriment was nothing more than a lingering memory. \"It\u0027s supposed to be our night off,\" Suzan said, pouting. \"Remember? No policing tonight.\" But Cassie knew it was only a matter of time before the Spring Fling became about Circle business, just like everything else. Come to think of it, she was surprised it had taken this long. The group dutifully exited the dance floor and gathered near the back wall. Max sauntered over to them with his usual air of confidence. He was dressed in a black shirt, black pants, and a necktie as brilliantly green as his eyes. \"Hey,\" he said, greeting Diana first, as always. \"Is Faye around? I can\u0027t find her.\" \"Didn\u0027t she tell you?\" Diana said. \"Faye\u0027s got a terrible cold.\" \"Oh,\" Max said, disappointed. \"No, I didn\u0027t know. She hasn\u0027t answered any of my calls.\" When Max pouted, his features softened, bringing out the boyish charm to his face. Diana frowned sympathetically. \"Don\u0027t take it personally. She\u0027s been knocked out on decongestants since yesterday. I bet she turned her phone off.\" Cassie couldn\u0027t tell if Max was buying Diana\u0027s story or not. She thought he looked more confused than skeptical, but Diana must have sensed some suspicion in him because she didn\u0027t stop there. \"Just because Faye\u0027s not here doesn\u0027t mean your night should be ruined,\" Diana said to him. Max cracked a sideways, hopeful smile. \"Dance with me,\" Diana said. And before Max could even react, she grabbed him by the arm and hurried him to the dance floor. The band was still playing a slow song, so Diana clasped her arms around the back of Max\u0027s neck and let him hold her lower back. Max gazed into Diana\u0027s eyes as if he couldn\u0027t believe his good fortune. All his arrogance and swagger had given way to a sturdy modesty, and he held Diana with care. Faye was the furthest thing from his mind, Cassie was sure of that. \"I know we want to keep an eye on Max,\" Adam said. \"But this is ridiculous.\" Cassie noticed Adam\u0027s jaw tighten as he watched the couple dance. Diana was laughing, squeezing Max close, having what appeared to be a pretty good time. Cassie wouldn\u0027t dare say so to Adam, but she couldn\u0027t help but sense Diana wasn\u0027t thinking about the Circle anymore. A few minutes later, Chris, Doug, and Sean turned up at Cassie\u0027s side. \"Do you see what I see?\" Chris asked, and Cassie followed his gaze to the opposite side of the gym. It was Mr. Boylan, standing with his arms crossed in a finely cut dark suit, his gaze locked on Max and Diana on the dance floor. \"He looks like he\u0027s about to kill someone,\" Doug said. \"What should we do?\" Just then Mr. Boylan turned the other way and stormed out of the gym. \"Follow him,\" Cassie said. The three of them - Chris, Doug, and Sean - bolted toward the exit without a moment\u0027s hesitation. Cassie saw from the look on his face that Adam was anxious to join them. \"This is my chance to search Mr. Boylan\u0027s office,\" he said. \"For his relic.\" So much for a night off, Cassie thought. But if Adam could steal Boylan\u0027s relic from him it would be the equivalent of robbing him of his power. He couldn\u0027t perform the killing curse without it. Cassie grazed Adam\u0027s cheek with her hand and nodded. \"It\u0027s a good idea, but you shouldn\u0027t go alone. You\u0027ll need a lookout.\" \"We\u0027ll go,\" Deborah said. She and Suzan stepped forward, a little too anxiously. \"We\u0027ve been itching for something interesting to happen all night. Or at least I have.\" She acknowledged Suzan, who was still sulking about being pulled from the dance floor. \"Be careful,\" Cassie said, as if it were an order. She was still a Circle leader, after all. \"I\u0027ll keep an eye on Diana and Max.\" Adam gave Cassie\u0027s hand a squeeze and then took off. Deborah and Suzan followed him toward the hallway that led to Mr. Boylan\u0027s office. Cassie allowed herself a moment to breathe, to remind herself that though everything was suddenly happening so fast, it was all under control. Her control. Then Nick materialized from the crowd with another glass of punch for Cassie. \"I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s not spiked,\" he said. \"But at this rate I think we can both at least count on a sugar high.\" Then he noticed the expression on Cassie\u0027s face. \"What\u0027s going on?\" His dark brown eyes darted back and forth. \"Where is everyone?\" \"Chris, Doug, and Sean are tailing Boylan. Adam, Deborah, and Suzan are searching his office.\" \"I thought we were here to take it easy,\" Nick said. \"Change of plan.\" Cassie scoped the gymnasium for Diana\u0027s blond hair and Max\u0027s broad shoulders, but they\u0027d gotten lost in the swarm of students. \"Do you see Diana anywhere?\" Nick inspected every couple on the dance floor then shook his head. \"It\u0027s too crowded. But I have an idea.\" He ran to the punch table and, to the dismay of the servers, climbed up on top of it for a better view. He scanned the room back and forth and then he froze in place. His sharp features turned deathly serious. \"Cassie,\" he whispered, and jumped down. But before he could utter another word, Cassie caught sight of a wild mane of dyed-red hair. It was no hallucination this time. No paranoia. Right in the center of the crowd was Scarlett. Nick looked ready to pounce, but he didn\u0027t move a muscle. \"She\u0027s casting a spell,\" he said. Scarlett\u0027s arms were rigid at her sides and her eyes were as black as marbles. She was muttering something under her breath, obviously some kind of dark magic. \"We have to get you out of here,\" Nick said. \"Right now!\" Cassie was smart enough not to argue. She and Nick rushed toward the nearest exit, but suddenly everyone around them started to act odd. Their necks went soft and their heads drooped down. Their classmates had all fallen into a stupor. Nick shot a look at Cassie. \"What the heck is going on?\" He positioned himself between Cassie and the nearest group blocking the exit. Whatever Scarlett was doing seemed to be affecting everyone but Cassie and Nick. But it soon became clear that their classmates were simply collateral damage. With them out of the way, Scarlett now had a clear shot at her intended target. She redirected all her wicked mumbling straight at Cassie: Spirant ultimus spiritus Ultimus spiritus vitae Suddenly all the air rushed out of Cassie\u0027s lungs and she couldn\u0027t inhale any more in. It was like a clamp had fastened around her throat, blocking her breath. She brought her hands to her neck and turned to Nick. There was no breath to enable a scream. Nick ran to her as if it were a simple piece of food lodged in her throat, as if the Heimlich maneuver could save her - but there was nothing he could do. And with their stupefied classmates crowding every exit, there was no way to escape. Cassie\u0027s head spun from the lack of oxygen. She reached out for Nick as she fell to the gymnasium floor.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-7.html","bookId":2099,"book":{"id":2099,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Hunt (The Secret Circle #5)","description":"Storyline: For Cassie and her Circle of witches, it\u0027s hard to imagine life in New Salem getting any worse.
