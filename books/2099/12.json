{"id":90794,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Cassie arrived at the beach for the full moon ceremony just as Diana was drawing a circle in the sand with her pearl-handled knife. It was already five minutes to midnight, when the moon would be at its highest point, so she had to hurry. Diana went around the circle with water she\u0027d collected from the ocean, then with a stick of calamus-scented incense, and finally with a lighted white candle. Pungent, smoky smells filled the air. \"Cassie,\" Adam called out when he spotted her. \"Where\u0027ve you been? I\u0027ve been calling you.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. I know.\" Cassie continued watching Diana. \"I was helping my mom clean up after dinner and I lost track of time.\" \"Uh-oh,\" Faye said, loud enough for everyone to hear. \"Don\u0027t you two know good communication is the foundation of a healthy relationship?\" \"Actually,\" Suzan said, \"I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s trust.\" Faye smirked. \"No, that can\u0027t be it.\" Adam was not amused by their banter. \"I had something important to tell you.\" He made an effort to pull Cassie aside. \"That\u0027s why I kept calling.\" \"You guys! It\u0027s almost midnight, come on!\" Diana held a lit candle in one hand and reached out to grab Cassie with the other. But she clutched Cassie\u0027s pointer and index fingers just where her most recent burns had scabbed over. Cassie cried out softly in pain. Diana looked at her, confused. \"Are you okay?\" Cassie stretched the sleeves of her shirt down over her hands. \"Did I hurt you?\" Diana asked. Faye and the others gathered around Cassie. \"Lift up your sleeves,\" Faye commanded. After a glance at Adam, Cassie did as she was told. Immediately, everyone\u0027s eyes settled on the scars and scabs she\u0027d been working so hard to keep hidden. Cassie looked around and realized the time had come for her to tell them about her father\u0027s book. There was no other way of explaining the burns, and Cassie didn\u0027t want to outright lie to her Circle - they didn\u0027t deserve that. With an encouraging nod from Adam, and with the group\u0027s rapt attention, Cassie made a clear, concise announcement: \"I have Black John\u0027s Book of Shadows,\" she said. \"It\u0027s what gave me these scars.\" \"You found - you mean - are you serious?\" Diana sputtered. Cassie nodded. \"I\u0027ve been searching it for any hint on how to defeat the hunters or Scarlett. But it\u0027s dangerous,\" Cassie continued, holding up her hands as an example. \"You have to understand, I don\u0027t want anyone else to get hurt, not until I know it can help us.\" Faye leaned on Sean to keep from falling over. \"Black John\u0027s book has been in your house this whole time? And you kept it from me?\" She was practically hyperventilating. \"I can\u0027t even imagine the spells that must be in there. Go get it, Cassie. Right now.\" Cassie shook her head. \"I can\u0027t read it, and neither can you. It\u0027s written in an ancient language. And besides, we don\u0027t know what the book is capable of.\" \"Actually, Cassie,\" Adam interrupted, \"that\u0027s why I kept calling you earlier.\" Seagulls squawked in circles overhead as Adam regarded the group, a gloomy look on his face. \"Cassie showed me a portion of the book yesterday, and I was up all night trying to translate it. I compared some of the symbols in the book to the ancient map I used to locate the Master Tools.\" Diana nodded, knowing that map well. \"I remember those inscriptions,\" she said. \"Black John had written them himself.\" Adam fixed his eyes on Cassie again. His voice was a stricken monotone. \"From the little bits and pieces I could figure out, Cassie is now bound to Black John\u0027s book.\" For a few seconds Cassie lost her hearing. The hammering thump of her heartbeat was the only sound in her ears. She could see everyone\u0027s reactions - Diana\u0027s terror, Faye\u0027s apprehension, Adam\u0027s distress - but she felt like she was watching them from somewhere hushed and far away. It was gruesome, the way the faces of her friends altered. Not one of them would ever think of Cassie the same way again. \"Are you sure?\" Diana asked. Her voice hit Cassie\u0027s ears with a pop. \"Bound was definitely the word I translated,\" Adam said. \"And any dark magic involving that word can\u0027t be good.\" Diana took a deep breath. \"No. Not good at all.\" \"What exactly does this mean?\" Suzan asked. \"In the scientific sense,\" Laurel said, \"being bound simply means being held to another element. It\u0027s a union, physical or chemical. And it\u0027s inseparable.\" Melanie cut in to clarify. \"Simply put, it means Cassie\u0027s obligated to the book. As in tied in bonds. Like a prisoner.\" \"Melanie.\" Diana chastised her with a glare. \"It\u0027s an attachment. That\u0027s all. Don\u0027t jump to worst-case scenarios.\" Cassie wanted the group to believe Diana was right: that being bound to the book only meant she was attached to it, nothing more. But Cassie couldn\u0027t deny what she knew to be the truth: The book did have an influence over her. Every time she touched it, it was like darkness took her over. She was beginning to feel like she had a split personality. Cassie began to cry, and Adam walked slowly over to her. He put his arm around her torso. \"Cassie, I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re going through all this. But the Circle can help you now. You\u0027re not in this alone.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" Diana took a step closer and also put her arm around Cassie. \"We can all look into those symbols and help with the translation.\" \"You can copy a few pages at a time for us to study,\" Adam said. \"Using the obsidian crystal, so you\u0027re as safe as possible.\" There were supportive nods around the Circle, except from Faye who crossed her arms over her chest. \"Just to be clear,\" she said. \"We are talking about Cassie being undeniably linked to dark magic, right? That\u0027s what Black John\u0027s book is, and that\u0027s what Cassie\u0027s bound to.\" A heartrending stillness settled over the group like a heavy quilt. There was absolute silence except for the roar and crashing of waves in the distance. Adam nodded grimly. \"Like Scarlett, Cassie does have dark magic in her blood, and the book is obviously reacting to that.\" He turned to Cassie and swallowed hard. \"In fact, as someone who knows dark magic so well, Scarlett might be able to tell us something useful about the book. Maybe she can help.\" Cassie stared down at the sand, unable to speak. \"Adam,\" Nick shouted. \"You do remember that Scarlett is out to kill your girlfriend, right?\" Faye raised an eyebrow. \"Trading off Princess Cassie for Evil Witch Scarlett? That sounds like a great suggestion to me.\" \"And while we\u0027re at it, we can get the Master Tools back,\" Deborah said. \"That\u0027s not what I meant.\" Adam shot Cassie a desperate look. \"I just meant we could confront her. Maybe even bargain with her.\" \"No way,\" Nick said. \"If we find Scarlett, we\u0027re taking her down, not asking her for advice.\" Cassie forced down the bile that had risen in her throat. She staggered back to the center of the group and everyone got quiet again, their faces turned toward her expectantly. \"It\u0027s not a bad idea to try to get information out of Scarlett.\" She looked at Adam with a strained smile, though she was beginning to wonder if he had feelings for Scarlett he wasn\u0027t admitting - even to himself. \"But we\u0027re dealing with two evils here, and at least the book can\u0027t fight back.\" And with that, Cassie had the final word.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-12.html","bookId":2099,"book":{"id":2099,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Hunt (The Secret Circle #5)","description":"Storyline: For Cassie and her Circle of witches, it\u0027s hard to imagine life in New Salem getting any worse.
