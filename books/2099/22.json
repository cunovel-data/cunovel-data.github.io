{"id":90804,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Later that night, after the mourners had gone home, the Circle convened in Diana\u0027s living room. They sat motionless, leaning on one another, staring into space as if waiting for something none of them could name. They listened to the sound of the driving rain on the roof and the savage gusts of wind buffeting the bay window. Outside, the night sky had turned pink in the storm: Suzan\u0027s favorite color. Nobody knew what to say, and there was much not being said. Those unspoken words hung in the air like ghosts in their midst: that it could have been any one of them who\u0027d been killed. That if Cassie hadn\u0027t shown up, they\u0027d all have witch-hunter death symbols glowing on their foreheads. It was a strange mind-set, to be both grieving for the death of their friend while also giving thanks that they\u0027d been spared. Faye sat hugging her knees to her chest on the end of the couch, separate from the others. Her eyes were blank and drooping with exhaustion. Cassie understood it would be a long time before Faye was acting like herself again, and even then, she might never be the same. Diana took a deep breath and looked at the group. \"One of our own is dead,\" she said. \"The Circle has been broken.\" Her Book of Shadows was at her side. She picked it up and brought it into her lap. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about this any more than you do, but we have to find out what happens now that our Circle is incomplete.\" \"It means we\u0027re weak again,\" Deborah said. \"Like we were before we initiated Cassie, before we were whole.\" Melanie nodded. \"This is the worst time for us to have an unbound Circle, with the combined threat of the hunters and Scarlett. I don\u0027t mean to sound cold, but we need to initiate someone in Suzan\u0027s place as soon as possible.\" Laurel\u0027s eyes welled up with tears. Cassie couldn\u0027t blame her. She could hardly stand to think about these technicalities either. She wanted to go home, take a hot bath, and bury her head in her mother\u0027s shoulder. But she had to stand by her friends - she had to try to help in whatever way she could. Cassie offered the Circle the only information she knew. \"Scarlett said whoever dies in a bound Circle has to be replaced by someone of their own bloodline. Whoever\u0027s next in their family lineage. So we\u0027re not going to have much say in the matter of who fills Suzan\u0027s place.\" \"Right,\" Adam said, responding to Cassie. \"But Suzan had no siblings or other family that we know about. So what happens now?\" \"Maybe it becomes a wild card,\" Nick suggested. \"And we get to choose whoever we want.\" \"I wish that were the case, but I\u0027d be shocked if it were that simple.\" Diana flipped through her Book of Shadows, searching for something. Within a few seconds she found the page she was looking for. \"This is a family tree spell,\" she said, holding the book up for all to see and then setting it back down on her lap. \"It could help us fill in any blanks in Suzan\u0027s ancestry.\" Adam read the spell over Diana\u0027s shoulder. \"It can definitely tell us who would be next in line. If there is anyone.\" \"I\u0027m pretty sure Suzan\u0027s bloodline ended with her,\" Deborah said. \"She was the only child of two only children, wasn\u0027t she?\" \"We can\u0027t be too sure.\" Adam looked up from the book. \"Suzan\u0027s family was notoriously tight-lipped. Her father refused to talk about the past with her at all. I think checking her family tree is worth a try.\" Diana read over the detailed instructions. \"It seems simple enough. All we need is some canvas paper and ...\" Her voice trailed off. \"What?\" Sean asked, sounding like he sensed the worst. \"We need something of Suzan\u0027s,\" Diana said quietly. \"Something containing DNA. Like her blood.\" The room fell silent. Awful visions of Suzan\u0027s body buried tightly beneath the cold ground rushed through Cassie\u0027s mind. \"There\u0027s no way,\" she said. \"Forget it.\" But Laurel quickly got up and ran into the other room. She returned carrying Suzan\u0027s soft leather purse. \"I brought this so we could perform a deep peace ritual tonight. As a memorial with some of her favorite things.\" Laurel opened the purse so they could all view its contents. It was a mishmash of makeup, bubble gum, and crumpled up Twinkie wrappers. Cassie felt a lump form in her throat. There was something sacrilegious about going through a deceased person\u0027s personal items. The purse even smelled like Suzan. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to find any blood in there,\" Cassie said. \"At least I hope you don\u0027t.\" \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m looking for.\" Laurel lifted Suzan\u0027s hairbrush out from the bottom of the purse. She pulled a few tangled strands of Suzan\u0027s strawberry-blond hair out of its bristles. \"There\u0027s your DNA,\" she said to Diana. \"It\u0027ll work the same as a blood sample.\" \"Laurel, you\u0027re a genius.\" Diana bolted to her desk drawer to retrieve a canvas art pad. She flipped through the pad, past a number of charcoal drawings and acrylic paintings, until she found a blank page. She tore it out carefully and brought it back to the group. Then she continued reading from her Book of Shadows. \"We\u0027ll still need ink,\" Diana said. \"But it has to come from something Suzan had direct contact with. Is there a pen inside her purse? If she used it recently it might still contain some of her energy.\" Laurel dug through the bag, but she couldn\u0027t find a pen. \"No luck,\" she said. \"But this might work.\" She offered Diana a bottle of Suzan\u0027s nail polish. It was the same color she\u0027d painted her nails earlier that week - sparkle-flecked magenta. Diana took the bottle from Laurel and uncapped it. \"She definitely had contact with this.\" Cassie and the others gathered around Diana, forming a circle, as she prepared the spell. She placed the canvas flat on the floor and scattered Suzan\u0027s hair on it, as her Book of Shadows instructed. Then she trickled a few drops of the nail polish on the center of the page and said: Reveal to us Suzan\u0027s family tree. And who our new Circle member will be. Immediately, pinkish purple lines soaked into the veins of the paper like blood. Up from the bottom of the page, a tree began to draw itself in watery magenta strokes. It was thick at its base and grew upward and out in long stalks, spreading across the entire canvas. Branches formed and then names attached to each branch. \"It\u0027s working,\" Diana said. \"I don\u0027t believe it.\" Cassie watched each generation of Suzan\u0027s family grow from the tree like blossoming fruit. The first names to appear dated back three hundred years, which meant Suzan\u0027s ancestors must have been among New Salem\u0027s founding families. The tree grew fast through the decades and seemed to be picking up speed as it neared the present. By the time Suzan\u0027s parents\u0027 names appeared, almost every inch of paper had been inked over in fine print. \"Linda Forsythe,\" Laurel said. \"That was Suzan\u0027s mother who passed away in the storm. We would have known her as Linda Whittier.\" \"Forsythe?\" Cassie said aloud, but nobody heard her. She hadn\u0027t remembered until now that the surname Whittier came from Suzan\u0027s father\u0027s side. She hadn\u0027t given any thought at all to Suzan\u0027s mother\u0027s bloodline. \"Forsythe?\" Cassie said again. Her stomach twisted at the sight of it. \"That was Suzan\u0027s mother\u0027s maiden name?\" But no one responded. Everyone was too focused on the next line being drawn to the tree. Linda Forsythe\u0027s name connected to her husband\u0027s and then branched out to form Suzan\u0027s name. But then another branch formed from Linda Forsythe\u0027s name: Laura Forsythe. \"Who\u0027s that?\" Melanie asked. \"It looks like Suzan\u0027s mother had a sibling we didn\u0027t know about. A sister. Forsythe ...\" Diana said, turning to Cassie, her face pale. \"Hold on. Isn\u0027t that - \" The final name on the tree brought Diana to a deathly silence. It branched downward from Laura Forsythe\u0027s name and glowed in bright magenta: Scarlett Forsythe. \"No,\" Cassie said. But she watched in horror as one final deep red line connected Suzan\u0027s name to Scarlett\u0027s. \"This can\u0027t be right,\" she said. \"Suzan and Scarlett can\u0027t be related.\" \"Suzan and Scarlett were cousins?\" Adam said. \"Does this mean what I think it means?\" Laurel asked. Cassie broke into a cold sweat. So that was the name of Scarlett\u0027s mother. Laura Forsythe. The woman who\u0027d sparred with Cassie\u0027s own mother over Black John\u0027s affections. She had run away from New Salem, Cassie knew that. Her mother said she\u0027d disappeared, never to be heard from again. But here she was now, long after she\u0027d died, appearing once more as a crucial element to both the past and the future. \"Suzan definitely had no idea she had an aunt,\" Melanie said. \"And Scarlett must not have known either. Or else she would have gone after Suzan the same way she went after Cassie for her spot in the Circle.\" Diana picked up the canvas and stared at Scarlett\u0027s name. \"And now she\u0027s gotten it anyway. She\u0027s our new member, whether we like it or not.\" \"Unless we don\u0027t initiate her,\" Cassie said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-22.html","bookId":2099,"book":{"id":2099,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Hunt (The Secret Circle #5)","description":"Storyline: For Cassie and her Circle of witches, it\u0027s hard to imagine life in New Salem getting any worse.
