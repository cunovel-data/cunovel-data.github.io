He was bent over her, trying to get her to breathe, but Cassie could feel herself losing consciousness with each second that passed. The yellow gymnasium light, their comatose classmates, and even Scarlett\u0027s wicked voice had blended into a soft, shadowy haze. Then Nick stood up and raised his arms with outstretched hands.\\n\\n No! Cassie tried to cry out - the worst thing Nick could do right now was perform magic out in the open - but no sound escaped her gaping mouth.\\n\\n Nick centered his energy, closed his eyes, and made his voice deep:\\n\\n I call on the Power of Air, the element from the East, I call you from the atmosphere to Cassie\u0027s lungs.\\n\\n He repeated the spell three times, louder each moment, but Cassie continued to fade out of consciousness. The whole world diffused; sound ceased. There was nothing. And then all at once she gasped like a drowned woman resuscitated, reclaiming her life with one greedy breath after another.\\n\\n Her vision sharpened with each inhalation, and she climbed to her feet just as Nick raised his hands to call out another spell - this time not at Cassie, but up at the ceiling:\\n\\n Motion of heart, current of soul, spark to my hands, at the speed of light.\\n\\n His face took on a lustrous glow and electricity seemed to pass through him, up from his feet and out of his fingertips.\\n\\n The overhead bulbs flashed and then burst, raining down spectacular long-tailed sparks like fireworks. Then the gym went black as night.\\n\\n \"Run,\" Nick said, grabbing Cassie\u0027s hand.\\n\\n Their stupefied classmates panicked in the sudden darkness. Cassie could no longer see them, but she could hear them grunting and groaning. Their elbows and knees knocked against the gym floor as they tumbled over one another in a massive stampede.\\n\\n Cassie and Nick raced through the maze of bodies, heading for the emergency exit, without once looking back to see what had become of Scarlett. They stormed through the fire door out to the side parking lot, where they ran straight into the rest of the Circle.\\n\\n \"Are you all right?\" Diana asked in alarm. \"What just happened in the gym?\"\\n\\n Nick and Cassie hurriedly explained the situation and Diana\u0027s mouth dropped open. \"Scarlett\u0027s here?\"\\n\\n Both Henderson brothers bolted back to the gym to find her. Cassie screamed for them not to, but they were already gone.\\n\\n \"Someone has to stop them,\" she cried out. \"They\u0027ll get themselves killed.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go,\" Deborah said, taking off in the same direction as the Hendersons. Suzan followed just behind her.\\n\\n Diana searched Cassie for any sign of an injury. \"Are you sure you\u0027re okay? You aren\u0027t hurt?\"\\n\\n Cassie nodded. \"I\u0027m fine. I think we got out just in time. Where\u0027s Adam?\"\\n\\n \"Right here.\" Adam walked up to the group, looking pale. His hands were trembling slightly and they were empty of Mr. Boylan\u0027s relic. \"Cassie,\" he said. \"Have you been out here long?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m okay,\" Cassie said to reassure him.\\n\\n Adam appeared more shaken than she was. His breathing was heavy and his forehead was soaked with sweat. He scanned the surrounding area with apprehension.\\n\\n \"Scarlett\u0027s nowhere to be found,\" Chris called out as he and Doug exited the gym to rejoin the group. Deborah and Suzan were alongside him.\\n\\n \"The lights are still out, but everyone in the gym is back to normal,\" Doug said. \"Which is too bad, really. I kind of liked the idea of them all being zombified.\"\\n\\n Cassie looked at Nick, happy he was okay. He was so quick to react, and he\u0027d saved her life, but she never intended for him to be in danger like that. Especially with Mr. Boylan and Max around.\\n\\n Nick returned her gaze. He seemed to understand exactly what she was thinking and he smiled reassuringly for her. It was just then that Cassie saw something glisten on the sleeve of his leather jacket. It was dim at first, but once she noticed it, it appeared to shine more clearly. It was the hunter symbol.\\n\\n \"Nick,\" she said, but that was the only word she could get out.\\n\\n He registered Cassie\u0027s expression and then watched everyone else\u0027s face fall into the same shock.\\n\\n \"What?\" he asked. \"Why do you all look like you\u0027ve seen a ghost?\"\\n\\n \"Your sleeve,\" Diana said. \"You\u0027ve been marked.\"\\n\\n Cassie went to him, but Nick shook her off. He searched his jacket and located the mark. He concentrated hard on it, squinting as if trying to understand it, but had no other reaction.\\n\\n \"So I have,\" he said, in a voice as still and cold as stone.\\n\\n Adam barely said a word the whole car ride home to Cassie\u0027s. Cassie didn\u0027t take it personally; she didn\u0027t feel much like making conversation either. What was there to say after an evening like this? But when Adam parked in front of her house, he cut the engine and turned to her like he had something to get off his chest.\\n\\n \"Are you sure you don\u0027t want me to stay on your couch for the night?\" he asked. \"Scarlett might still be coming after you.\"\\n\\n There was a chill in the air that made Cassie shiver. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"But I\u0027ll be okay. Faye and Laurel are there, and Faye wouldn\u0027t miss the chance to act on some of her anger if Scarlett showed up.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s true, I guess.\" Adam tapped his fingers on the steering wheel.\\n\\n Cassie was wearing his suit jacket draped over her shoulders to keep warm. She went to take it off and give it back to him, but he stopped her.\\n\\n \"Keep it on a little longer,\" he said. He made no motion to restart the car\u0027s engine. Something else was obviously on his mind.\\n\\n Cassie feared she knew what it was. Adam was concerned that Nick being marked would mean he\u0027d have to start spending the night in Cassie\u0027s basement. The two of them would be sleeping under the same roof.\\n\\n She decided to help him along. \"Adam,\" she said. \"About Nick staying here ...\"\\n\\n Adam stared straight ahead. \"It\u0027s not that,\" he said. \"Can I ask you one more time what happened when the lights went out in the school?\"\\n\\n \"I told you,\" Cassie said. \"Nothing happened with Nick while you were gone that you need to worry about.\"\\n\\n \"I just need to hear it again.\"\\n\\n Cassie had already given Adam a detailed account of her and Nick\u0027s every move from the moment they spotted Scarlett to their escape. But she repeated the story anyway.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just so strange,\" he said, unable to look at her.\\n\\n \"Adam, what are you freaking out about? I know if you had been there when Scarlett showed up, you would have protected me, just like Nick did. I don\u0027t doubt that for a second.\"\\n\\n Finally Adam turned to Cassie, allowing her to see his tearful eyes. \"I felt something,\" he said. \"An arm brushed up against mine in the chaos.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Cassie was confused.\\n\\n \"When the lights went out. I had just come out of Boylan\u0027s office and everyone started running. I was making my way toward the gym when someone grabbed my hand, and it felt like ... I don\u0027t even know.\" Adam could barely continue, and Cassie began to understand just how upset he was.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" she said, trying to coax the full truth out of him. \"What did you feel?\"\\n\\n \"I thought it was you leading me to safety, but then we got separated. I could have sworn it was you. Because of the sparks I felt.\"\\n\\n \"But I was already out of the gym and in the parking lot by that point,\" Cassie said. \"It wasn\u0027t me.\"\\n\\n There was a moment of silence as it all sank in.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" Cassie said, finally comprehending what this meant. Neither of them wanted to say it out loud, but it was obvious. It was Scarlett who\u0027d grabbed Adam\u0027s hand. The sparks he felt were for her.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s you that I love, Cassie. I swear it.\" Adam\u0027s voice rose. \"This doesn\u0027t mean anything.\"\\n\\n \"It means the cord between you and Scarlett must be real after all,\" Cassie said. \"That\u0027s the only explanation.\"\\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t even have told you.\"\\n\\n \"Of course you should have told me!\"\\n\\n \"This doesn\u0027t change anything.\" Adam persisted. But the more he swore and pleaded, the more obvious it was to Cassie that he was just as shaken by this as she was, if not more.\\n\\n \"My hand just got confused,\" he said. \"That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"Your hand got confused?\" Cassie took an immediate breath to recalibrate her emotions. If she wasn\u0027t careful, her hurt and anger would blow up right in Adam\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to feel guilty,\" she said, trying to sound sympathetic. \"It\u0027s not your fault. It just is.\"\\n\\n Adam got quiet then. \"But I don\u0027t want this.\"\\n\\n Cassie reached over to give Adam a kiss good night. She needed to get out of his car as quickly as possible. \"I know,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t worry too much about it. We\u0027ll be okay.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it? Don\u0027t you think we should talk about this?\" Adam asked.\\n\\n Cassie slipped Adam\u0027s suit jacket from her shoulders. It smelled like him, like autumn leaves and ocean wind. She gently folded it and placed it on his lap. Then she put her hand on the door handle.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s going to be okay,\" she said, knowing she had to appear strong for Adam in this moment. Adam could always be relied on to reassure Cassie. Now it was her turn.\\n\\n \"Cassie, please don\u0027t go.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s sleep on it,\" she said, as sweetly as she could. And then borrowing a favorite phrase of her mother\u0027s, she added, \"Everything will look brighter tomorrow.\"\\n\\n She got out of the car and almost made it to the front door before tears filled her eyes and began running down her face. But Adam couldn\u0027t see them, and that was all that mattered. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-8.html","bookId":2099,"book":{"id":2099,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Hunt (The Secret Circle #5)","description":"Storyline: For Cassie and her Circle of witches, it\u0027s hard to imagine life in New Salem getting any worse.
