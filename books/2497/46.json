{"id":106264,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"Text of a letter to Francesco Ragoczy in Venezia from Olivia in Roma: To Sanct\u0027 Germain in Venezia, Olivia of the Eternal City sends loving greetings of the same sort. So Demetrice is going to leave you after all? You may not believe this, but for your sake I am truly sorry. It is unfortunate that she had to make the change before she was prepared. If there had been more time, undoubtedly she would not feel as she does. She is an intelligent and sensitive woman, you tell me, and in time the wounds will heal and she will not be distressed by what you are and what she has become. Yet I know this is painful to you. For so long you have wanted someone who knows you for what you are, understands it and loves you for it. I\u0027m not sure such a woman exists, but if she does, if she ever does, I hope with all my heart that you will find her and love her until the end of time. From what you have told me about the other, Estasia, it may be just as well that she burned. If she had made the change when she died, she would have been the sort of vampire who gives our kind the hideous reputation we have gained. We are like elephants, my dearest friend. Most elephants live happily with people, enjoying them, and help them. But it is not by these that elephants are known, but for the rare one that turns rogue, that rampages through towns, killing all in its path. One with the hunger of Estasia would have been a rogue among us. Because of her death, we are all spared danger and pain. Another one of the cardinals has died and of course the blame is laid at Alessandro\u0027s door. Why he should bother to poison a feeble old man of eighty-six I can\u0027t imagine. But the Borgias have a certain reputation and it haunts them as surely as ours haunts us. When you leave Venezia, come to Roma for a time. I have missed you and with all this fear of poisons and plots, my life is severely circumscribed for the time being. Perhaps we might go to one of the old villas at Ostia, or visit Sicilia. I have a small boat of my own, with provisions for carrying earth, so you need not fear to be sick. I thank you for the painting. As you know, Semele is one of my favorite allegories, though after all this time I am flattered you remember. I will do as you request and not hang the painting where it can be seen. But how can anyone have believed that something that beautiful was evil? Never mind. Even if you could explain, I would never understand. You must excuse me. A very beautiful young man has just arrived and I am most interested in learning more of him. I will write again later, perhaps. Oh, Sanct\u0027 Germain, I wish that you will find what your soul is seeking. And if my love will help or lend you courage, you know that you have it, as you always have. Olivia In Roma, on the Feast of the Blessed Virgin, a horridly hot August 15, 1498","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-palace-saint-germain-2/page-46.html","bookId":2497,"book":{"id":2497,"title":"The Palace (Saint-Germain #2)","description":"Storyline: The Palace (Saint-Germain #2) The anticipated paperback release of the second title in Yarbro\u0027s long-running Saint-Germain series featuring immortal vampire Francesco Ragoczy da San Germano.
