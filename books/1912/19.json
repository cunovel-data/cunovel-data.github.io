He continued kissing Marguerite, moving across her cheek, down to her throat, where he bit. She arched up at the strength of the bite, where Chloe could see teeth marking skin. Tyler squeezed Chloe with his other hand, moving her against Marguerites leg. Oh Goddess, it felt good, and he began a massaging motion that kept her in a slow, subtle rhythm.\n With the two of them drawing her in like this, she couldnt help but obey the motion. She was vibrating all over, just watching, working herself in involuntary, semi-restrained jerks against Marguerites leg as Tyler multi-tasked with riveting efficiency, making sure Chloe kept building that fire in herself even as he moved to Marguerites shoulder, teased at her bra strap beneath the blouse with his teeth. Then he lifted his head, his gaze fixed on Marguerites face with fierce brilliance.\n Move it out of my way.\n Chloes sex spasmed at the authority in his tone, irresistible. In response to his demand, Marguerite slid open a couple of buttons on her shirt and drew the fabric aside then released her front-closing bra. It slid back, giving Chloe a glimpse of the nearly exposed curve. Then Marguerite lifted her hand above her head, clasping the top slat of the lounge chair so there was no impediment to his access to her body, her face.\n A s he bent, Chloe watched his mouth seal over the already aroused nipple at close range. Taking it in, he began to suckle in a way that made her own breasts ache in envy. Tylers hand descended further, took a firm hold of Chloes right buttock at the most sensitive part of the curve and squeezed. With the right pressure and manipulation of fingers, he had Chloe shamelessly working her clit against Marguerites body. Marguerites hand slid up the back of her shirt, playing with her bra strap, and Chloe didnt know how they could even think, let alone coordinate all this. Her mind was just completely immersed in the close-up sensory input. A fter working out in the sun, Tylers biceps were hard and slick under her hand.\n The men working on the stage were just across the lawn, their view impeded only by some light vegetative screening around the patio. They could get a hint of what was going on, but not the full view. While he didnt mind sharing with Chloe, she doubted Tyler was amenable to exposing his wifes body and arousal to other men. Still, the possible voyeuristic glimpse, with Tyler protective and in control, was enough to stir Chloe further.\n A mid her haze of desire, she also realized she didnt fear him. There wasnt that hesitation, that self-sabotage that had occurred with Brendan, perhaps because she wasnt the focus, the bulls eye center of the target. She was only a passerby, a witness so close she was drawn in, in an entirely non-threatening way.\n Tylers other hand had coiled on Marguerites clipped-back tail of hair, wrapping it to hold her head at the angle he desired, keeping it back as he sucked her. Chloes hand slid down his arm and back up, digging into his shoulder. The slow rock of her body against Marguerites leg kept her arousal in a lazy, sweet spiral that mercifully kept her thoughts at bay. Tylers pace on Marguerites breast had likewise slowed, and Chloe found it explosive to watch the way he licked and nibbled, sweet and easy, nuzzling her at his own pace. Obviously showing it was his pleasure he was indulging, to tease and taste his wifes nipple as long as he wished, no matter how much she might shudder or plead beneath him.\n But Marguerite was still, as if she understood what he required. However, her stillness wasnt dispassionate. Chloe felt the heat coming off her skin now, the little involuntary jerks the intense arousal made it impossible to suppress, reflecting the tremendous effort it took to remain motionless under stimulation. If Marguerites desire was as great as Chloes, it had to be building to a combustible level.\n She was amazed she was doing this, but she supposed she shouldnt be. Being around Brendan had left her hormones in chaos, and setting up for a fetish carnival was all about sensual delight. It was more than enough to keep her in a stir. Sexual arousal had the same effect as alcohol, lowering inhibition, making unwise decisions seem completely okay. This wasnt unwise; she trusted Marguerite and Tyler more than she probably trusted anyone, but it was certainly unsettling to find herself swept up in their erotic wake.\n Tylers head lifted. His gaze devoured Marguerites bared upper body. With careful movements, his expression registering every tremor of reaction under his touch, he slid the bra back in place, smoothing it over the aroused nipple. He bit the curve of her breast, eyes going molten as he earned one more suppressed gasp from her before he slipped the buttons closed. He also brought Chloes movements to an effective, shuddering halt by sliding his grip back to her hip, squeezing her there.\n Be still now. Ride the feeling, keep it going, but dont let it go. Not yet. He flashed teeth at her, more tiger than man, showing how he fought his own desire. His voice was a low rumble. Weve found that starting the carnival with unreleased desire is one of the best ways to enjoy it. To ensure the body and heart override the mind.\n Chloe became aware that Marguerites stroke on her back had become more calming and on the outside of her T-shirt, though she vividly remembered the touch of her fingers under her bra strap. Tylers arm was still braced behind her, his body and male heat so close. Oh I think Im there, she said. If I saw a puppy about to be run over, or Brendan naked, that puppy would be a greasy spot. She gave a nervous little laugh. I dont know whether to be embarrassed now, or awkward, or\n What would you like to be? Marguerite dropped her other hand from the top of the chair to rest on Tylers forearm. With Chloes hand still on his biceps, they formed a reassuring, connected circle.\n Id like to not have to say anything. To think about it, or not think about it, and just be kind of worried it happened. A nd flustered, in a good way. Why did you guys do that?\n To help you understand, give you a taste of what it will be like, Marguerite said. So you dont have to worry over it so much. Instead, you can think more about the possibilities.\n Thats her explanation. Tyler shrugged. I saw two beautiful women twined together and went from there.\n Despite herself, Chloe laughed. He gave her a lazy grin. But when he straightened, reaching for the carafe of sweet tea that Sarah, their housekeeper, had left on the side table with the lemonade, Chloe slid off the lounger. I think I will go help with those stuffed bears. Because if she didnt go do something, she was going to melt into a puddle of sexual frustration. Particularly if she hung around the two of them, with those pheromones still zinging like electrons around their nuclei. Her clit was astonishingly swollen, giving her a sense of the discomfort a man felt walking with an erection.\n She wanted Brendan so badly right now she could almost smell his scent on her skin from a few days ago. Whatever other thoughts she might have about the carnival, she knew that she wanted to see him. It could have been a root canal marathon for charity. She would have happily attended if he was going to be here.\n She turned and backpedaled. So the carnival starts at midnight tonight, right? Is there an opening ceremony before we get to play and visit?\n Yes. Tylers gaze held amusement, and a male awareness of her state that had her nipples tightening up almost as much as his wifes had been under his clever, hot mouth. Theres a welcome speech, very brief, and then the unattached submissives, or those willing to be shared by their Masters or Mistresses, are auctioned as the first fundraising event. We even have a couple Doms who will offer their services up for bids, since all the money goes to the battered womens shelter.\n Do you know when Brendan will get here?\n Tyler paused, glanced at Marguerite, then came back to Chloe, meeting her eyes with a steady look. Youll first see him on stage. Hes one of the slaves being auctioned.\n Chapter Nine\n To someone else? Yeah, he said hed be here in the capacity ofa sexual submissive. But hed wanted her to be here. Hed asked M to put her on the guest roll. To watch him have another woman do What the hell would they do to him?\n Marguerite was not a chatty person, so Chloe knew everything shed said earlier had meaning, significance. A s she got ready that night, she thought over those words, her emphasis on simply experiencing.\n Shed have to accept this, see where it was going to go. There was no way she could outbid anyone for him, even if she thought she had the nerve to do that. A s shed told Brendan, just to be here was ten thousand dollars per person, unless you were a special invited guest, like Chloe. Or him. Of course, now she knew what he was doing to pay his way, right?\n Stop it. She closed her eyes. Shed learned that some Zone club regulars, like Brendan, volunteered to be floating slaves for those who attended unattached. Was it like going to a boyfriends job and hoping for the chance to make out with him on breaks? She felt ungrateful and catty for even having the thought, but damn it, the excitement shed felt at seeing him tonight had a big black cloud hanging over it. She wasnt sure if shed rather just go home. Why hadnt Marguerite told her earlier?\n Resigned, she gave herself a look in the guestroom mirror. Shed been told that dress code ranged from anything tonothing. Literally. So shed been encouraged to wear something festive, but whatever made her feel most comfortable. Tonights opening sounded a little dressy, though. Five hundred exclusive guests with ten thousand dollars to blow, plus auction money and whatever else they anticipated spending on the events? The couple of nearby hotels were booked solid, plus temporary private quarters had been set up across the back lawn. Lovely colorful pavilion tents like for a knights tournament, in case guests didnt want to leave over the two nights the carnival would be held.\n Shed worn one of her favorite dresses, made of a soft wine-colored viscose fabric, a Renaissance style creation with a diamond neckline and vine embroidery that flowed down to the first of two satin inlays. There were touches of lace here and there, but the arms were left bare, and then there was a flowing crepe hem. She wore silver upper arm bands with Celtic scrollwork that matched a similar choker style necklace, and shed piled her short set of curls on her head, enhanced her eyes with dark kohl. True to herself, shed left her feet bare except for Indian silver anklets on each foot. They jingled with soft music beneath the flowing hem. Shed also added toe rings with yin and yang symbols on them. If nothing else, her feet would be spiritually balanced. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/branded-sanctuary-nature-of-desire-7/page-19.html","bookId":1912,"book":{"id":1912,"title":"Branded Sanctuary (Nature of Desire #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Branded Sanctuary (Nature of Desire #7) \n Chloe has always been a creature of joy and laughter.
