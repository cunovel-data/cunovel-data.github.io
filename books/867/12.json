{"id":10025,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 11: The Black Fellows.","content":"A few minutes after his conversation with Jim the party started, following the broad track through the grass along the foot of the hill. Reuben informed Mr. Blount of what Jim had told him. \"By Jove, I think he is right,\" the settler said. \"The track is as broad as it was, but it is nothing like so much trampled down; but if your fellow says the main body have gone over the hill, why are you following this track?\" Reuben gave his reasons, and said that his man had, before, had suspicions that the trackers were in communication with the wild blacks. \"He thinks that\u0027s why it is that they have so frequently failed, here, to catch any of these fellows.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t be at all surprised,\" Mr. Blount said savagely. \"The best thing would be to put a bullet into each of the rascals\u0027 heads.\" \"I think Jim\u0027s idea is best,\" Reuben said. \"Now that we have once got our eyes open, they won\u0027t be able to do us any more harm; and my black fellow will see we follow the trail right. I don\u0027t want them to see we have any suspicions of them, as that would put them on their guard; and by keeping our eye upon them, we may be able to turn the tables.\" \"That is so,\" Mr. Blount agreed. \"What are you going to do, then?\" \"I will call to them, in a minute or two, and tell them that it is your opinion that only a small portion of the flock have come this way. Then we will have a consultation and, no doubt, some of your friends will notice that the ground is not much trampled. Then we will decide to ride back to the point from which we started, and will follow the other trail.\" \"Yes, that will do very well,\" the settler agreed. Reuben at once called to the trackers, who were trotting on ahead, and then ordered a halt. The two blacks came back. \"Joe,\" Reuben said, \"Mr. Blount thinks that the main body of the flock have not come this way. He says he thinks only a hundred or two have come. The ground does not look to me anything like so much trampled as it was before we halted.\" \"I tink most of dem hab come along here,\" the tracker said sullenly. \"What do you think?\" Reuben asked the other settlers, who had gathered round. \"I did not notice it before,\" Dick Caister said; \"but now Blount has pointed it out, I agree with him entirely. There are nothing like the full number of sheep have passed along here. I should say that they have not gone along more than two or three deep.\" There was a general chorus of assent. \"You can\u0027t have been keeping your eyes open,\" Reuben said to the trackers, sharply. \"If you don\u0027t look sharp in future, we shall quarrel. \"Come, gentlemen, let us ride back to the halting place, and see if we cannot find out which way the main body have gone.\" Ten minutes\u0027 riding took them back to their starting place. \"They must have gone over the hill,\" Reuben said. \"They certainly have not kept along at the foot, or we should see their tracks in this long grass.\" The trackers had exchanged a few words in a low tone, and they now moved up the hill, and began to examine the ground carefully. \"Some of dem have gone this way, captain.\" \"Of course they have,\" Mr. Blount said. \"A blind man might see that.\" The marks of the sheep were indeed plain enough to all, when their attention had once been drawn to the subject. On getting beyond the crest the trackers turned to the left, and Reuben saw that they felt it would be hopeless to attempt, further, to mislead a party containing several settlers who were perfectly capable of following the trail. Jim had, since speaking to his master, remained in the rear of the troop. After three miles\u0027 riding across the downs, they again came down upon a flat country, thickly covered with brush. Here and there pieces of wool sticking to thorns were visible, and the trackers went steadily on for some little time. Then their pace became slower, and finally they stopped. \"Trail ended, captain.\" \"What do you mean by the trail ended?\" Reuben asked angrily. \"Why, I can see a piece of wool, on there ahead.\" \"Dat so, captain; but only a few sheep hab passed here.\" Some of the settlers dismounted and, having examined the ground carefully, declared that they were of the same opinion as the trackers. \"Very well,\" Reuben said; \"then in that case, we must go back again to the foot of the hill. They were all together there, and we must take up the trail afresh.\" On reaching the foot of the hill, Jim and some of the settlers joined the trackers, and penetrated the bush in all directions. Each returned bringing in pieces of wool. \"It is plain enough,\" Reuben said, \"what they have done. They have broken up into small parties, and have scattered. The question is, \u0027What are we to do now?\u0027 \"What do you think, Mr. Blount? You have had more experience than anyone here, and you are the most interested in our overtaking these rascals. What do you recommend?\" \"I don\u0027t know what to recommend,\" the settler said. \"They have no doubt done it to confuse us, in case we should follow so far, and avoid being thrown off the scent the other side of the hill. The band may really have scattered, and gone off in small parties to different parts of the bush; or again, they may have scattered with the understanding that they will meet again, at some given spot, which may be ten and may be fifty miles ahead.\" \"The worst of it is,\" Reuben said, \"I fear now that there is an end of all chance of coming up with them, today; and now the question of water comes in. If we could have caught them before nightfall, the horses, having had a good drink at that stream, could have done very well till we\u0027d gone another thirty miles; but as that seems hopeless, now, we must consider seriously what we had best do, before we go any further. Does anyone here know anything of the country ahead?\" There was a general silence. \"The horses can do very well, tomorrow, without water,\" Mr. Blount said. \"They will chew the leaves of this scrub; and can, if pressed, hold on for even two or three days upon it.\" \"In that case,\" Reuben said, \"let us go on. We will break up into three parties. One shall go straight forward, the other two moving to the right and left, each following the tracks as well as they can. We will not go much beyond a walk. We have five more hours of daylight yet, and the horses can manage another fifteen miles. I will halt, an hour before it gets dark, and light a fire. The smoke will be a guide to the other two parties, who should not be more than a couple of miles to the right and left, and they will then close in. \"If you can suggest any better plan than that, Mr. Blount, please do so. Of course, I see the objection that the blacks may make out the smoke, and will know that they are being followed.\" \"Yes, that is an objection,\" Mr. Blount said; \"but the chances are that they will know it without your telling them. It is more than probable that some of them have remained behind, on the watch; and that they will have signalled our coming, long ago.\" \"Dey have done that, sar,\" Jim, who was standing close to Reuben\u0027s elbow, put in. \"Jim saw smoke curl up from the top of de hill, just when we turned, when we lost the trail.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me before, Jim?\" Reuben asked. \"De captain didn\u0027t ask Jim any question. Jim thought de captain see it for sure.\" \"I didn\u0027t see it, Jim. I don\u0027t think any of us saw it. We were all too much occupied looking for the trail. Another time, you tell me what you see without my asking. \"Well in that case, Mr. Blount, there can be no harm in my making a smoke, as they know already that they are pursued. Will you take charge of the right hand party? Sergeant O\u0027Connor will take command of the left. Do you each take a tracker with you. I will take my boy. Three constables will go with each of your parties, and four with me. \"Will you gentlemen please to divide up, so as to make seven altogether in each party, without the natives?\" \"I need not tell you to keep a sharp lookout, Captain Whitney. We know the blacks are a very strong party and, now they know that they are pursued they may, as likely as not, make a stand.\" \"Yes, that is quite possible,\" Reuben agreed. \"Will you please be careful that neither of your parties get more than two miles, at the outside, away from mine? We can hear the sound of rifles, at that distance. If either party fires, the others will of course hurry to their assistance. Now, let us move forward.\" With Jim in advance, Reuben\u0027s party moved on, the black carefully examining the ground and bushes as he went; and occasionally, somewhat to Reuben\u0027s surprise, rising from the stooping position in which he was walking, and looking back over his shoulder. The motive was explained when Jim exclaimed: \"Dere, captain, dere are de signals again.\" Reuben turned in the saddle. On the crest of the hill behind him were three columns of smoke. Scarcely had he looked at them when the smoke ceased to ascend, as if the fires had been suddenly put out. \"That\u0027s to tell them that we have divided in three parties?\" Reuben asked the black. Jim nodded, and proceeded on his way again. \"That\u0027s awkward,\" Reuben said, \"I must warn the other two parties.\" So saying, he at once ordered two of the constables to ride right and left and warn the others, who were not as yet more than a quarter of a mile on either hand, that the natives were aware that they had broken up, and that the greatest caution must, therefore, be observed. In ten minutes the two constables returned, having performed their mission. Although he had no reason to believe that the blacks were within ten miles of him, Reuben now took the precaution of sending one constable out on each flank, to a distance of fifty yards. A third was directed to keep with Jim, fifty yards ahead of the main body; consisting of Reuben himself, a constable, and two colonists. Occasionally Reuben rode forward to question Jim. \"How many sheep do you think have gone along the track you are following?\" \"About thirty sheep, and three black fellow.\" \"How do you know there are three black fellows, Jim? I can see marks, sometimes, of the sheep\u0027s feet; but I have not seen a man\u0027s footprint at all.\" \"Jim see \u0027em, captain, plain enough. When dey all follow sheep, not very plain to see; but sometimes, when de sheep want to scatter, Jim see one footmark on one hand and one on the other, and sure to be one man behind.\" \"How far are the sheep ahead, Jim, have you any idea?\" \"Six, eight hours, sar, when dey pass here; but dere\u0027s no saying how far they are, now. May be long way on, may be only little way. Me tink dat they hab not gone so berry far; dat smoke berry thin, not see him more than ten miles.\" \"I wish you had said that before, Jim,\" Reuben said. \"We would have kept together and have galloped on, and taken our chance of finding them.\" \"Might have found four or five of dem,\" Jim replied, \"but de others all scattered. No good to find dem, till dey come together again.\" \"No, you are right there, Jim. We must catch them all together, if we can. There are some twelve hundred sheep, somewhere ahead. Mr. Blount said there were about fifteen hundred driven off. We have come upon a hundred dead ones, and two or three hundred may have taken that turn to the right. As you say, it would be no good coming upon thirty.\" For four hours the party continued their journey. \"It is six o\u0027clock,\" Reuben said, looking at his watch. \"We will halt, now, and light that fire.\" Two of the constables were told off to keep watch, some fifty yards in front; and the others dismounted, and gathered together materials for a fire. This was soon done, and the smoke mounted straight and clear, a signal to the other two parties to close in. Suddenly a cry was heard from one of the sentries. The men stooping round the fire leaped to their feet, just in time to see one of the constables struck from his horse by a boomerang, while a dozen spears whizzed through the air at the other. He fell forward on his horse, which carried him up to the fire; as he fell from the saddle, as it stopped, he was caught by two of the others. Three spears had pierced him. \"Stand to your arms. Steady, for your lives,\" Reuben shouted. \"Jim, throw the horses at once, and fasten their legs. \"We must defend ourselves here,\" he continued, turning to the others, \"until help comes.\" Not a moment was lost. The little party threw themselves down in a circle, each taking shelter behind a bush; and Jim speedily got the eight horses down in the centre, for each party had with it three of the spare animals. The whole time, from the first alarm until all was ready to receive the natives, did not occupy two minutes. The horses of the sentries had galloped wildly on, both having been struck by spears; and Jim had no difficulty with the remainder, which were all standing in a group when the alarm was given, the owners not yet having removed their saddles. All was done without flurry or excitement, although the yells of the natives rose from the bush all round them. The bush was fortunately not very thick at the point where they had halted, Reuben having selected it for that very reason; but the bushes were sufficiently near to each other to enable an enemy to creep up, within thirty yards or so, without being seen. \"Don\u0027t throw away a shot,\" Reuben called out; \"but pick off the blacks, as they stand up to throw their spears. \"Ah!\" The exclamation was accompanied by a shot from his rifle, as a native rose suddenly from the bush and hurled his spear. It missed Reuben by an inch or two only; but, as his rifle flashed out, the black threw up his hands and fell back in the bush. \"Here, sah, dis make good shelter;\" and Jim propped up his saddle, almost in front of him. \"That\u0027s a good idea, Jim; help the others in the same way.\" A Fight with the Black Fellows The five men were all engaged now. The spears whizzed fast over and among them, but most of them were thrown almost at random; for the blacks soon learned that to raise themselves above the bushes, to take aim, was to court sudden death. Jim, after distributing the saddles to their owners, had lain down by the side of his master; and loaded his rifle as fast as he discharged it, Reuben using his pistols as effectually as the rifle, in the intervals. Fortunately all the party were provided with these weapons. Had it not been so, each man would have been liable to be rushed by the blacks every time he discharged his rifle. As far as possible they fired by turns; so that each man, while loading, was covered by the fire of those on his right and left. For half an hour the fight continued. Many of the blacks had fallen, but they continued the assault as vigorously as before, and all the defenders had received more or less serious wounds from the spears. \"The others ought to have been here, long before this,\" Reuben said, \"if they had followed my instructions. I only hope they have not been attacked, too; but as we don\u0027t hear any firing, that can hardly be so.\" \"I hope they will be up before dusk,\" Dick Caister said. \"It will be dark in another half an hour. These fellows are only waiting for that to make a rush. If they do, it is all up with us.\" \"They will find it a tough job, even then,\" Reuben said; \"but the others must be here long before that. I told them to keep within two miles of us. They have had time to ride double that distance, since we made the smoke for them.\" Another ten minutes elapsed. \"Hurrah!\" Reuben exclaimed, \"I can hear the trampling of horse\u0027s hoofs. The moment they arrive, make a rush for your horses and charge.\" \"I am afraid the horses are killed,\" Dick said ruefully. \"In that case,\" Reuben said, \"we must get to our feet, and pick off the blacks as they run. They will get up like a covey of partridge, as the horsemen come among them.\" A loud cheer was heard, and the little party, with an answering shout, sprang to their feet and, rifle to shoulder, stood expecting the blacks to rise; but the ears of the natives were sharper than those of the whites, and they had begun to crawl away before the latter heard the approaching horsemen. Finding this to be the case, the party ran to their horses. Four exclamations of wrath and grief were heard, for seven of the horses were completely riddled with spears. Tartar, however, at his master\u0027s voice, struggled to rise to his feet. Reuben, aided by Jim, quickly threw off the hobbles; and leaped on to its back as it rose to its feet, just as Mr. Blount, with his party, rode up. \"Keep close together,\" Reuben exclaimed, as he dashed forward, \"we may find some of the scoundrels.\" But the chase was in vain. It was already growing dusk, and there was no saying in which direction the natives had crawled away in the bush. After riding for a mile, Reuben reined in his horse. \"It is no use,\" he said; \"we may as well get back to the fire. \"What made you so late, Mr. Blount? We were fighting for three quarters of an hour, before you came up.\" \"I am very sorry,\" Mr. Blount replied; \"somehow or other, we went wrong altogether. There is nothing to guide one in this flat bush, and the tracker who was leading the way said he was certain he was going as you ordered him. Just before six o\u0027clock we halted, and looked in the direction in which we expected to see your smoke, but there were no signs of it. Presently one of the constables exclaimed: \"\u0027There\u0027s the smoke, sir, right behind us.\u0027 \"I looked around and, sure enough, there was a column of smoke, and a long way off it was. \"\u0027What have you been doing, you rascal?\u0027 I said to the black. \u0027There\u0027s the smoke right behind us. You have been leading us wrong, altogether.\u0027 \"The black insisted that he was right, and that the fire must have been made by the black fellows. I didn\u0027t know what to make of it. It was two or three minutes past six; and I noticed, when we halted before, that your watch was exactly with mine. So I said to the men: \"\u0027We will wait five minutes longer and, if we see no other smoke, you may be sure that that is made by Captain Whitney.\u0027 \"We waited the five minutes, and then I gave the word to start, when one of the men exclaimed: \"\u0027The black fellow\u0027s gone.\u0027 \"Sure enough, he had slipped away without being noticed, while we were looking for the smoke. I felt sure, now, that something must be wrong; and we galloped towards your smoke, as fast as the horses could lay their feet to the ground. When we were about half way, we heard the sound of firing, and I can tell you that we didn\u0027t lose a moment on the way, after that. Have you had any losses?\" \"Two of the constables are killed,\" Reuben said, \"and we have all got some more or less ugly scratches. My left arm is useless for a time, I am afraid. A spear went right through it. I fear some of the others have worse hurts.\" \"What can have become of the sergeant\u0027s party?\" Mr. Blount said. \"They must have gone the wrong way, too,\" Reuben replied. \"I told you I suspected those trackers of being in league with the blacks, and I have no doubt your fellow led you purposely astray, in order to give them an opportunity of cutting us off before you could arrive to our assistance. I suppose the other party has been misled in the same way. It is fortunate, indeed, that you made up your mind to ride for our smoke when you did. A quarter of an hour later, and you would have found only our bodies, and would probably have been ambushed in turn.\" \"Yes, it has been a close thing, indeed,\" Mr. Blount said. \"I was wrong, after what you told me, to trust that black scoundrel so entirely; but I own it never entered my mind that he was leading us astray.\" By this time they had reached the fire, which was blazing high. \"How are you all?\" Reuben asked. \"Nobody badly hurt, I hope?\" \"Nothing very bad, captain,\" Dick Caister replied cheerfully. \"We have all had our skin ripped up a bit, but nothing very deep. That dodge of the saddles, of your black fellow, saved us. Mine was knocked over half a dozen times by spears, each of which would have done its business, if it hadn\u0027t been for it. I owe him my life so completely, that I forgive him for making our horses a barricade, to save yours.\" Reuben laughed. He had noticed, when he ran for his horse, that Jim had thrown him in the centre of the others: and their bodies completely sheltered him from the spears of the natives. \"It was not fair, perhaps,\" he said; \"but my horse would have been killed, as well as yours, had he not done so; and Jim loves him almost as well as he does me. He has watched over and guarded him for the last three years.\" \"I am not angry with him,\" Dick said. \"Nothing could have saved our horses from being killed, and if one was to be saved, it is as well it should be Tartar, and not one of the others, as yours was far the most valuable of the five.\" \"Pile on the bushes,\" Reuben said to one of the constables. \"Make as big a blaze as you can. It will act as a beacon to the sergeant and his party.\" Half an hour later the trampling of horses\u0027 hoofs was heard and, a few minutes later, the sergeant and his party rode up. \"I am sorry I am so late, sir,\" the sergeant said. \"Somehow or other we went wrong altogether, and saw nothing of your smoke. I was afraid something was wrong, but did not know what to do; so we halted till it came on dark, and presently made out a fire; but it was miles away, and right in the direction from which we had come. I did not think it could be you but, whether it was you or the blacks, that was the place to ride to.\" \"Have you got the tracker with you, sergeant?\" \"Yes, sir; at least, I saw him trotting ahead, ten minutes ago. Why, where has he got to?\" The tracker was not to be seen. \"He has made off to join the blacks, I expect,\" Reuben said. \"You have been led astray purposely. We have been attacked, and Brown and Simpson are killed.\" An exclamation of rage broke from the men, who were in the act of dismounting. \"I expect,\" Reuben said, turning to Mr. Blount, \"that the fellows noticed the talk I had with Jim, before we turned back from the false trail, and concluded that we had some suspicion that they were in league with the blacks; and so, when the party separated, they determined to lead the two flanking columns astray, so as to give their friends a chance of attacking us, and then to bolt.\" \"I expect that is it,\" Mr. Blount agreed. \"And now, the first thing is to get something to eat. When that is done, we will have a consultation.\" While the meat was cooking over the fire, Reuben told off a party of eight men to bury the bodies of the two constables who had fallen. The task was speedily completed, two holes being easily scraped in the light, sandy soil. After supper was over, the settlers gathered round Reuben. \"Now, captain, what do you mean to do?\" Mr. Blount asked. \"I have given up all hope of seeing my sheep again, so don\u0027t let them influence you, but just do as you think best. The blacks are in strong force, that is evident; and it will be a serious business pursuing them any further, in their own country.\" \"I am going to pursue them till I catch them,\" Reuben said; \"that is to say, as long as there is a sheep track to serve as a guide. I don\u0027t ask you, gentlemen, to go further, for I know it is a serious risk; but it is my duty to hunt those fellows down, and give them a lesson, and I mean to do it. We shall never have safety in the settlements, until those fellows come to understand that, whenever they attack us, they will be hunted down.\" \"I think you are right,\" Dick Caister said, \"and as long as you go on, I go with you for one, whatever comes of it. But how I am to go without my horse, I don\u0027t know.\" \"There are the spare horses,\" Reuben said; \"Fortunately we have still got six of them.\" \"So we have,\" Dick exclaimed joyfully. \"I had forgotten all about them. What luck, our bringing them with us!\" The other settlers all announced their intention of continuing the chase, as long as Reuben was willing to push on. \"I will tell you what my idea is,\" Reuben said. \"The horses are already worn out and, by the end of another day, they will be half mad with thirst. I propose that we take two days\u0027 supply for ourselves, in our water bottles; and that we push forward on foot, sending two of the constables back to the stream, with our horses. I propose that we should push forward tonight. I expect the track we are following is the true one, and the stars will do as a guide. \"At daybreak we will lie down in the bushes. The blacks will probably leave some fellows behind, as scouts. They, seeing nothing of us, will suppose we have given it up and gone home, and they will make but a short journey. At night we will go on again, and the chances are that, before morning, we shall catch sight of their fires, and will fall upon them at daylight. What do you think of the plan?\" \"I think it is a good one,\" Mr. Blount said, warmly. \"A capital plan. Of course we don\u0027t much like leaving our horses, for in this country one almost lives on horseback. Still, it will be the best plan, certainly; for as you say, the poor brutes will be half mad, by tomorrow night, with thirst.\" \"It will be a long tramp back again,\" a settler said dismally. \"We won\u0027t tramp all the way,\" Reuben said with a smile. \"Directly we have overtaken the blacks, and given them a lesson, I will send Jim back again for the horses. He can cover the ground at a wonderful pace, and coming back he will ride one of them, and help the two constables to keep them together. They will have had two days\u0027 rest, and plenty of food and water, and will meet us before we get halfway back. There will be no fear of the blacks attacking them.\" All agreed that the plan was excellent, and half an hour later the whole party—with the exception of the two constables, who were to start at daybreak with the horses, for the river—set out on their march. The sky was cloudless, and the stars would have been a sufficient guide, even had they not had Jim with them. The black, however, took his place at the head of the party, and strode along as unhesitating as if it had been broad daylight.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3167/86894.html","bookId":867,"book":{"id":867,"title":"A Final Reckoning","description":"简介： In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers.
