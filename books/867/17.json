{"id":10030,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 16: Jim\u0027s Report.","content":"\"Jones, what is it?\" \"Your black has just come, sir. I would not let him come in; for the fact is, he ain\u0027t a figure to introduce among ladies.\" \"What\u0027s the matter with him, Jones? Not hurt, I hope?\" \"He has been knocked about a bit, sir; and he is done up with travelling. The poor fellow can hardly crawl, and was half starved; so I set him to work eating, and came off to fetch you.\" By this time they had arrived at the door of the shed. Jim was sitting by a fire, eagerly devouring a hunch of cold meat. The men were standing round, waiting till he had appeased his hunger before they asked any question. He looked up and nodded, when Reuben entered. \"Well, Jim, I am glad to see you back,\" Reuben said heartily. \"I was beginning to be afraid about you. I hope you are not hurt?\"—for the black had a handkerchief tied round his head. Jim gave a grunt, but continued stuffing great lumps of meat into his mouth. Reuben saw that he must wait till the black\u0027s hunger was satisfied, and stood quietly looking on until, having devoured some five pounds of meat, he gave a sigh of contentment, and then took a long draught of rum and water, which Constable Jones handed to him. \"Jim better now,\" he said. \"That\u0027s right, Jim; now tell us all about it.\" Jim\u0027s story was a long one, and it took more than an hour in the telling; for his English was not always distinct, and it often required much questioning, on Reuben\u0027s part, before he could quite make out its meaning. The substance was as follows: On leaving, some ten days before, on the mission of discovering the haunt of the bush rangers, he knew that it was of no use to go among the wild blacks, their allies; as the hostility against their semi-civilized fellows was so great that he would, at once, have been killed. He resolved to go back to the spot where the track had been obliterated, by that of the flock of sheep; to make a wide circuit, and pick it up beyond and, if possible, follow it until he found them. The difficulties were great, for the bush rangers had spared no pains in hiding their trail; keeping always upon hard, high ground, and at one time getting into the bed of a running stream, and following it for two miles before they again struck for their rendezvous. However, step by step Jim had tracked them; sometimes losing the trail altogether, sometimes guided merely by a fresh-made scratch on the surface of a stone, or by a broken twig or bruised blade of grass. At last, he traced it far out into the bush, many miles beyond the furthest range of settlements, and then he lost it altogether. There had been a halt, for some time, at this spot. Beyond this, Jim was entirely at fault. He made circle after circle round the spot, but could find no trace whatever of their passage, and returned to the point where he had missed the trail. He relit the embers of the fire which the bush rangers had made, cooked some food, and laid himself down—first to think it over, then to sleep, for it was now just the close of day. It was clear to him that here, more than anywhere else, the bush rangers had made a great effort to throw anyone who might be pursuing them off the trail. He had no doubt that the bush rangers had muffled their horses\u0027 hoofs with cloth, and had proceeded with the greatest care through the bush, so as to avoid breaking a single twig in their passage; and the only reason for such greater caution could be that it was here, and here only, that they wished to throw the pursuers off the trail. It would have seemed, to a white man, that they had done this before, especially when they had kept in the water course; but to black Jim\u0027s perception, it appeared that they had been more careless than would be expected; and that, while apparently doing their utmost to conceal their tracks, they had really left sufficient indications to allow a practised tracker to follow them. Why then, now that they were far beyond the settlements, and fairly in the country of their native allies, should they, for the first time, so hide their trail that he could not discover it? The result of Jim\u0027s thoughts was that, when he awoke at daybreak, he started back towards the settlements. When he came to the river which the party had passed, in pursuit of the natives, he kept along its bank, scrutinizing the ground with the greatest care. After six miles\u0027 walking he suddenly stopped, at a point where the soft turf near the margin was cut up by the passage of the party of horsemen. Here was the confirmation of his ideas. Arguing the matter out with himself, Jim had arrived at the conclusion that, hitherto, the trail had been a false one, the bush rangers\u0027 object being to lead their pursuers to believe that they had gone far out into the native country; whereas, in fact, their hiding place was somewhere among the settlements. Should this be so, the only way to find them was to search for their back track. This he had now found and, with a shout of triumph at his own cleverness, Jim forded the river and followed the track of the horses. This was now clear enough, the horsemen taking no pains whatever to conceal their traces, feeling perfectly confident that any pursuers must now be thrown off the scent. Jim followed it till sundown, when he had made some thirty miles; and then, withdrawing some little distance from the tracks, he made his fire and camped for the night. He was now inside the line of the outlying stations, and had approached to the edge of a bit of wild and broken country, which offered so few inducements to settlers that it had been passed by for the better land beyond; although occasionally, when herbage was scarce, the settlers in the neighbourhood drove the animals up to feed among its hills. The black had no doubt that the gang, of which he was in pursuit, had their haunt somewhere in the heart of this wild and little-known tract. In the morning he again started and, after travelling several miles, entered a narrow valley with very steep sides, with trees and brushwood growing wherever they could get a foothold. He now adopted a careless and indifferent carriage and, although he kept a sharp lookout, no one who saw him would have supposed that he had any particular object in view. Presently he noticed that the tracks turned sharply off from the line he had followed, in the centre of the valley; and entered the trees, which grew thickly here at the foot of the hills. He made no halt, even for an instant, but walked straight on. Half a mile further he sat down and lit his fire, and began to cook some food. He had no doubt that he was watched for, just after he passed the point where the track turned off, he heard a very low whistle among the trees. As he sat by the fire, he kept his back towards the direction from which he had come; and when he presently heard footsteps, no change in his attitude betrayed that he was conscious of the fact that persons were approaching him, until two men stopped beside him. Then, with a cry as of sudden alarm, he leapt to his feet. \"Lor\u0027 a mussy!\" he exclaimed, \"de white man frighten me bery much. What for dey no say dey come?\" \"Who are you, nigger, and where do you come from, and what are you doing here?\" \"My name Jim,\" he said; \"me going tro\u0027 the country looking for place to tend hosses. Me bery good at hosses. Me look arter de hosses ob Mr. Hudson.\" \"What did you leave him for?\" one of the men asked, sternly. \"Someting lost from de house,\" Jim said quietly. \"Massa Hudson tink me took it. He make bobbery, so Jim ran away and look for nodder place.\" \"Um,\" the man said; \"I wonder whether you are speaking the truth? If I thought you weren\u0027t, I would put a bullet through your head, in double-quick time.\" \"No, sah,\" Jim said in great terror; \"dat de truth, sure \u0027nough. Jim try to get work at Sydney. Couldn\u0027t get; so start away, and ask at all de stations. No one want black boy for hosses, so keep on and tink dere more chance out furder. Does massa want a boy for hoss?\" \"What do you think, Bill?\" the man who had spoken asked his companion. \"Shall we put a bullet in this fellow\u0027s head, at once, or make him useful?\" \"I dussay he is a liar,\" the other replied; \"but then all these black fellows are liars, so that does not make much difference. A black fellow would certainly be useful for the horses, and to look after the fire. We can always shoot him when we have done with him. We shall soon see, by the way he handles the horses, whether he has been accustomed to them.\" \"All right,\" the other said. \"You come along with us then.\" \"What wages massa pay?\" Jim asked. \"Anything you may be worth. Don\u0027t you fret about wages.\" Jim pretended to hold out for a fixed sum; but the man said, in stern tones: \"Come along, we don\u0027t want no more jaw, so you had best hold your tongue.\" No other words passed till they got back to the trees, and then turned off where the horses had previously done so. Two minutes\u0027 walk brought them to a roughly-made shed, built against the almost perpendicular side of the hill. It was built of logs, and there was nothing to show that it was inhabited. No smoke curled up from the chimney. The door and shutters were closed. Anyone who, passing through the valley, had turned among the trees and accidentally come upon it, would have taken it for some hut erected by a wood cutter. One of the men knocked three times at the door, and it was at once opened. Jim was pushed inside, the men followed him, and the door was shut. \"Who have you got here?\" a man, sitting by the side of a large fire some distance inside the cottage, asked angrily. \"It\u0027s a nigger who wants work. He says he is accustomed to horses so, as it was the choice between shooting him and bringing him here, we thought we might as well bring him to you. It would be handy to have a fellow to look after the horses, and cut the wood, and make himself useful. If we find he is of no use, there will be no great trouble in getting rid of him.\" \"That is true enough,\" the other said, \"and I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much risk about it. \"Come here, you fellow, and let me look at you.\" Jim stepped forward towards the fire. He saw now that the hut was built against the entrance to a cave of considerable size. In the centre was a great fire, the smoke of which probably made its way to the surface through crevices in the rock above. Four other men, besides the one who had addressed him, were lying on sheepskins against the wall. There was an opening at the further end of the cave into an inner chamber; and here Jim knew, by an occasional snort or an impatient pawing, the horses were stabled. The chief of the party asked a few more questions as to where Jim had come from, and how he chanced to be passing through so unfrequented a country. As the black had already decided upon his story, the questions were answered satisfactory enough. \"I think he\u0027s all right,\" the man said, at last. \"At any rate here he is, and he\u0027s not likely to go out again. We have been talking of getting a black fellow, for some time; and as here is one ready to hand, we may as well make the best of him. \"Look you here,\" he went on sternly, to the black; \"you come of your own free will, and here you have got to stop. You will have as much to eat as you can stuff, plenty of rum to drink, and \u0027bacca to smoke; and if there\u0027s anything else you fancy, no doubt you can have it. Only look you, if you put your foot outside that door, unless you are ordered to do so, I will put a bullet through your black brain.\" \"All right,\" Jim said. \"Plenty eat, plenty drink, plenty smoke; dat suit Jim bery well. He no want to go out of de house, if massa say no.\" \"That\u0027s settled then. Now, put some more logs on that fire.\" Jim at once assumed his new duty, and the bush rangers, who all hated the slightest work, were soon well satisfied with their new acquisition. There were several carcasses of sheep, hanging from hooks placed in the roof, where they were slowly smoked by the fumes from the wood. A pile of logs were heaped up in one corner, and these had to be cut up into sizes and lengths suitable for the fire. At one end a space was roughly partitioned off, and this was filled with groceries, flour, and cases of wine and spirits which had been taken from waggons going up country. In the stable were several sacks of oats; and a barrel filled with water, which was drawn from a spring, a short distance from the hut. The first time Jim went into the stable the captain accompanied him, and soon saw, by the black\u0027s handling of the horses, that his account was so far accurate, and that he was thoroughly accustomed to stable work. The cooking was also handed over to him, and the gang passed their time in sleeping, drinking, playing cards, and discussing plans of robbery. For the first few days a sharp watch was kept up on the black, and the men went out themselves to chop wood, or bring in water when it was required. After a few days, however, they relaxed their vigilance, and Jim gradually took these tasks also upon himself. He was perfectly aware, although he pretended to be unconscious of it, that the first few times he went out one or other of the bush rangers stole quietly after him, and watched him at work; but as nothing suspicious was observed in his conduct, this supervision was gradually given up. \"It\u0027s time to be moving again,\" the leader of the band said, about a week after Jim had joined them. \"We settled the next job should be Donald\u0027s station. We know for certain that he generally has money by him, and there will be the watches and trinkets of the women. That fellow Thompson, who worked for them at first, says he has got a first-rate cellar of wine; and that the women were both out-and-outers. If they are as pretty as he says, we will have them here, lads, to do the housekeeping. We want something to liven us up; besides, we shall forget our company manners, if we don\u0027t get some ladies to keep us up to the mark a little.\" There was a burst of coarse laughter. \"What do you say, boys; shall we start tomorrow? It\u0027s a long ride, and we had best leave about noon. We must get into the neighbourhood before dark, so as to give the horses twelve hours\u0027 rest before we begin; for we may have to ride for it. \"It ain\u0027t likely. Barker\u0027s is the nearest station, and it would be hours before they could get together men enough who would dare to follow us; but still, it\u0027s just as well to be prepared, and since that confounded new police officer has been on the station, there\u0027s never been no certainty about things. We owe him one for that last affair, which cost Smith, Wilson, and Mulready their lives; but we will pay him out yet. Who would have thought of his being there, just on that very night? I swear, if I ever catch him, I will roast him alive.\" \"He is no fool,\" one of the others said. \"He gave it those black fellows hot, and no mistake. The sooner he\u0027s put out of the way, the better. He\u0027s a different sort of chap than the last fellow. I sha\u0027n\u0027t feel comfortable till he\u0027s got either a spear or a pistol bullet in him.\" Jim Notes the Bush Rangers\u0027 Plans for Mischief Jim, who was squatting in the corner, apparently half asleep, was listening intently to every word. They did not heed his presence in the slightest; for indeed he had, since his arrival, so mixed his talk with native words that the bush rangers had no idea that he could follow their conversations. He was thinking, now, what was his best course to adopt. In the first place, he had gathered from their talk that this was only one of their hiding places, and that they seldom stayed very long in one neighbourhood. The question, therefore, was whether they would return. It was of no use his going to give the alarm, unless he could return before his escape was suspected; or they would have made off before he could get back again. As for the Donalds, whose station was to be attacked, it gave him no concern whatever; for the Australian blacks had little or no regard for life, except those of people to whom they were attached. It was Reuben\u0027s mission to capture the bush rangers and, had it been necessary, Jim would have remained quiet while a dozen families were slain, until he found an opportunity of bringing the police down upon them. He listened now, intently, for any word which might afford an index to their intentions. Presently the question he hoped for came. \"I suppose you will not come back here again, Tom?\" \"No, I thinks it\u0027s getting too hot to hold us, in these parts. We might ride back here, give our horses a rest, and load up with a few things we may want. We can bring two or three spare horses from Donald\u0027s. The weather is pleasant now, and we might very well put in a few weeks with the blacks. That last haul we made of traders\u0027 goods—cottons, and beads, and trumperies for the gins, and brass rings and such like for the men—will put them in the best of humours. You may be sure there will be a hot chase after us, after this business; and I should propose that we try our luck down south, for a bit.\" \"I agree with you,\" one of the others said. \"We have had a very good spell here, for the last ten months; and it don\u0027t do to tempt luck too long. That losing three of our number, last week, looked as if it was going to turn.\" \"What\u0027s it matter?\" the captain laughed. \"So much the more for us to divide. We have got a goodish bit of brass, now, to say nothing of the goods we have got at each of our places. We can fill up their places easy enough, any time; and those who come in are free to their share of what there is, in the way of grub and goods, but they only share in the brass from the time they join.\" Jim had heard what he wanted, and he now lay down and thought it out. They were only coming back for a short time. Possibly they might change their minds, and not return at all. It would be a risky thing to depend upon it; besides, his master might be blamed if this attack on the Donalds succeeded. It would be better, then, to try to get word to him, in time for him to be there before the bush rangers arrived. He himself would return to the hut; so that, if the police arrived too late, he would be able to continue with the bush rangers till some fresh opportunity occurred for bringing his master upon them. It was possible, of course, that one of the men would be left in the hut, in which case he had only to wait. The next morning the men busied themselves examining and cleaning their arms, and after dinner they went to the inner cave, and led out their horses. \"Now, look here,\" the leader said to him, \"we are going away, you see.\" Jim nodded. \"We come back again tomorrow. I lock this place up, you stop quiet till we come back. If anyone comes and knocks, while we away, don\u0027t Jim answer. Let them think place empty.\" \"All right,\" Jim said shortly, and went and sat down by the fire, as if he had no further interest in their proceedings. The windows, he had already noticed, had not only shutters outside; but they were firmly closed within, with massive planks, securely nailed and fastened. Jim heard the last of the party go out, and then the door was shut, and the lock turned. Jim heard the party ride off, and then threw himself on the ground and listened, to assure himself that they kept steadily on their way. The moment he was sure they were gone, he began to search the place for a tool which would fairly suit his purpose. Presently he found a large butcher\u0027s knife, with which they cut up the carcasses; and with this he set to work to dig a hole in the ground, close to the wall of the hut. The bottom log was only sunk a few inches in the soil, and in two hours he had burrowed under it, and made his way out beyond; then he crept back again, scraped the earth into the hole again as tightly as he could, crawling out backwards. He then placed a piece of turf over the outside hole, and stamped it down flat. It was possible that, after he had started, they might change their mind and send one of their number back again; that, however, had to be risked, and at a steady run he set off for the settlements. He did not make for the nearest; for he had gathered, from the talk of the men, that the convict labourers of most of the settlements in the neighbourhood were in league with them. After three hours\u0027 steady running, in which he had covered over twenty miles, he saw a shepherd\u0027s cottage and, making for it, gave the man the message which he had taken to Reuben. He had no sooner done so, and had found that the man was willing to set off with it at once, than he turned and retraced his steps to the hut, as rapidly as he had come. It was already dusk when he reached it. Instead of approaching boldly, he made a circuit and crawled up to it on his belly; and lay for some time, listening intently, with his ear to the door. He felt convinced that no one was there; but to make sure he knocked, and then withdrew among the trees. But all was still and, feeling sure now that the place was untenanted, he removed the piece of turf from the hole and made his way back into the hut again; carefully replacing the piece of turf, and then packing earth under it, so that it would not give way if trodden upon. This, however, was a very unlikely occurrence, as he had made the opening where some bushes screened it from view. He swept up every scrap of soil from the floor inside, filled up the hole there and trampled it down; and then, after indulging his appetite to the fullest, threw himself down and went to sleep. When he awoke, a few streaks of light streaming through the cracks of the door showed that it was day; and he made up the fire, and awaited the return of the bush rangers. It was four or five hours before they returned, and the instant they opened the door and entered, Jim was sure that they had failed; but to his disappointment all were there, and his plan of taking them in a trap had not succeeded. At this he was not surprised; for his own calculations, as to the distance to be traversed, had shown him that it was very questionable whether, even under the most favourable circumstances, Reuben could have got there in time with his men. Without speaking a word to him, the men led their horses through to the inner cave, and then threw themselves down by the fire. Jim at once proceeded to unsaddle the horses, and rub them down; keeping an ear open, all the time, to what was being said by the bush rangers. Their remarks however were, for a time, confined to terrible curses as to their luck. \"How did it come about, that\u0027s what I want to know?\" the leader said. \"This is the second time that accursed police fellow has turned up, and put a spoke in our wheel. Why, it was not more than half an hour after the first shot was fired before they was down upon us; there must have been pretty nigh twenty of them. How could they have got such a lot of men as that together, if they hadn\u0027t known that we were coming? It beats me altogether.\" \"So it does me!\" was the general exclamation. \"They seemed regularly to jump out of the ground, just when all was going pleasant. Never knew such a bit of luck—that is, if it was luck, and not done o\u0027 purpose—and yet, I don\u0027t see as they could have known, possible, as we was going there. Why, we didn\u0027t know ourselves till yesterday, not what day it was to be; and except ourselves, and that black fellow, no one could have known it.\" \"Well, it\u0027s certain none of us blabbed; and I don\u0027t see as how he could have told anyone.\" \"Not exactly,\" the leader said, \"considering he\u0027s been shut up here, ever since we have been away; besides, I don\u0027t believe he knew anything about it. He don\u0027t make out half we say to him and, when we are talking together, he minds us no more than if he had been a black monkey; but if he did, it\u0027s no odds, he could not have passed through these walls and back again; and if he could, who was he to tell it to? The men round here are all our pals, and would have cut his jaw short with a bullet. But there, it\u0027s no use talking about it, he\u0027s not been out, and there\u0027s an end of it. \"Still, it beats me altogether. That police fellow seems to know what we are up to, just as well as we do ourselves. I would give all my share of the swag we have made, for the last six months, for a shot at him.\" \"I don\u0027t like it,\" one of the others said, \"I don\u0027t; blest if I do; and I says as the sooner we are out of here, the better. After what\u0027s happened, I sha\u0027n\u0027t feel safe till I am well out in the blacks\u0027 country. If he knows what we are going to do, there ain\u0027t any reasons why he shouldn\u0027t know where we are.\" \"Why, Johnson,\" his leader sneered, \"you don\u0027t really believe the fellow\u0027s a sort of conjurer, do you?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" the man said doggedly. \"After he has turned up twice as he has, I shouldn\u0027t be surprised at nothing—not if I heard the sound of him and his men galloping up outside, now.\" There was a moment\u0027s silence, as each involuntarily listened. \"We are getting to be like a pack of gals,\" the leader said savagely, \"and I agree with you, the sooner we are out of this, the better. As soon as it gets dark, we will be on the move; but I tell you, directly we get out among the blacks, I shall come back again. I am going to carry off that gal, somehow. I\u0027ve owed her one for years and years, and I always pays my debts—at least, that sort of debt. \"Now then, you black, just leave them horses for the present, and come and cook us some food; the quicker, the better.\" Jim hurried about, but in the bush rangers\u0027 present state of temper, nothing would satisfy them; and when, in his hurry to satisfy their angry orders, he stumbled and upset a glass of spirits and water he was handing to the captain, the latter caught up a brand from the fire; and struck him so violent a blow on the temple, with the glowing end, that he fell senseless on the ground. He must have lain there a long time. He was brought to his senses by a bucket of water being dashed over him; and he found, when he staggered to his feet, that the band were preparing to depart. They had already packed up the bales of presents for the blacks, and placed them on the horses. Some of their more valuable belongings were packed away in a secret hiding place, the rest were left to take their chance till they returned; and indeed, except by their friends among the shepherds, there was little probability of anyone paying a visit to the hut, however long their absence might be. Had it not been that Jim had proved himself a really useful fellow, for the last week, they would have shot him at once and tossed his body in the wood; but they found it so pleasant, having all their work taken off their hands, that after a short discussion they decided to take him with them. The door was locked, and they started at a trot; but evening was closing in, their horses had already performed two long journeys in the last twenty-four hours, and they soon settled into a walk. They travelled for some hours and, it being then evident that the horses could proceed no further, a halt was called. No fire was lighted, for they were scarcely beyond the settlements and, for aught they could tell, an active search might still be carried on for them. So anxious were they, that they agreed to keep watch by turns; but when morning broke, it was discovered that the black was missing. The next quarter of an hour was spent in angry recriminations; but as none could say in whose watch he made his escape, their quarrel ceased. \"It\u0027s no use bothering about it,\" the leader said. \"There\u0027s one thing, he knows nothing, and can tell nothing against us. He may guess what he likes, but people don\u0027t waste time in listening to black fellows\u0027 stories. I expect he has only given us the slip because of that lick across the head I gave him, last night. I admit I was a fool to do it, but I wasn\u0027t in the best of tempers. \"However, if the worst comes to the worst, he can only lead them to the hut; and they won\u0027t find much worth taking, there. When we once get out to the blacks, we can snap our fingers at them.\" It was, indeed, about midnight when Jim had stolen away. He was still faint and giddy, and his face was terribly burned by the blow which had been dealt him; but when once fairly away from the bush rangers, he set out in the direction in which he knew the Donalds\u0027 station lay; and never halted until he arrived there, on the following evening, utterly wearied and worn out, for he had eaten nothing on the previous day. \"Then they have got away after all, Jim,\" Reuben said, when he had listened patiently to the long narration. \"You have done all that was possible, Jim. You have done splendidly, my poor fellow, and although we were just too late to catch the bush rangers, we saved the people here; but it is indeed unfortunate that they should have got off.\" \"Jim knows where dey hab gone,\" the black said. \"Dey hab gone to de country of Bobitu—I heard dem say de name. Jim know dat country well—he come from der.\" Further question showed that Jim had, indeed, belonged to Bobitu\u0027s tribe; and had come with a party of his people down to the settlements, where he was taken ill and left to die, but was picked up and nursed by Mr. Hudson. \"And you could take us there?\" Jim nodded. \"Bery long march, massa. Tree days, with horses. Plenty bad people; much fight.\" \"I don\u0027t care how far it is, or how much fighting we have got to do; I am bound to hunt down that fellow, however far he\u0027s gone. I suppose there is no trouble about water. If they can go there, we can.\" \"Four, six water holes,\" Jim said. \"No trouble about dat—trouble from de black fellow.\" \"Well, we must risk it, anyhow. We can\u0027t start for a day or two. I must send and fetch up all the police, and I daresay some of the colonists will join. The news of this business here has maddened everyone, and as it is not likely that the blacks will give any trouble for some time, and as we know the bush rangers have left for the present, no one need be afraid of leaving their station for a week or two.\" The next day mounted messengers were sent off in all directions, giving notice that the police would start, in three days\u0027 time, for a hunt after the bush rangers; and that there was, this time, every prospect of success, as their hiding place was known. On the day named, no less than thirty settlers assembled; together with the whole of the police force. All were well armed, and had brought several days\u0027 provisions with them. Mr. Donald had made marked progress, and the surgeon had now every hopes of his recovery; but as he could not be moved, and it was just possible the bush ranger might return to carry out his threat, during their absence, two constables were left in the house; and Kate was charged, on no account, to put her foot outside the door. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3167/86899.html","bookId":867,"book":{"id":867,"title":"A Final Reckoning","description":"简介： In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers.
