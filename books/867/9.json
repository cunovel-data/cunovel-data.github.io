{"id":10022,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 8: A Gale.","content":"\"Wilson tells me he thinks we are going to have a gale, Bill.\" \"Ay, ay, Reuben; anyone with half an eye could see that.\" \"Which way is it likely to come?\" \"Most likely from the north or northwest. At least that\u0027s the quarter it\u0027s likely to settle into; but there ain\u0027t no saying which way it may take us. I thought things had been going on too smooth to last. Now you are going to see what a storm is, my lad. You thought it was blowing when we went down the Channel.\" \"Is it likely to be much heavier than that, Bill?\" \"Heavier!\" the sailor repeated scornfully. \"Why, there\u0027s as much difference between a capful of wind in the Channel, and a gale off the Cape, as there is between a newborn baby and me.\" \"Do they last long, generally?\" \"Last! Why they goes on for weeks. There ain\u0027t no end to them. I\u0027ve wondered sometimes to myself where all the wind comes from, and where it goes to, onlass it works round and round.\" \"But it does work round and round, Bill?\" \"Ay, when you are near the centre of it. Why, lad, in three hours I have gone round the compass three times, with the wind dead aft all the time; but that\u0027s only when you are near the centre. When you ain\u0027t it blows straight, and I have known vessels run for days—ay, for weeks—with the wind blowing all the time in the same quarter. Some have been blown down right to the edge of the ice, south. I have been among the icebergs myself, two or three times, and I guess that many a ship has laid her bones down in the ice fields there, and no news ever come back home as to what\u0027s come to them; and what makes it worse is as we have convicts on board.\" \"What difference does that make, Bill?\" \"It don\u0027t make no difference, as long as all goes straight and fair. I have heard, in course, of risings; but that\u0027s only when either the guard are very careless, or the men is so bad treated that they gets desperate, and is ready to die on the off chance of getting free. So far we ain\u0027t had no trouble with them. The ship is kept liberal, and the poor wretches ain\u0027t cheated out of the rations as government allows them. The officer in charge seems a good sort, and there\u0027s no knocking of them about, needless; so there ain\u0027t no fear of trouble, as long as things go square. But when things goes wrong, and a vessel gets cast away or anything of that kind, then there\u0027s well-nigh sure to be trouble. The convicts seize their opportunity, and it ain\u0027t scarce in human nature for them not to take it, and then there ain\u0027t no saying what will happen.\" \"Why, what a croaker you are, Bill! I didn\u0027t expect that from you.\" \"I ain\u0027t no croaker, Reuben, but I knows what I knows. I have been through a job like that I am telling you of, once; and I don\u0027t want to do it again. I will tell you about it, some day. I ain\u0027t saying as I expect any such thing will happen, on board the Paramatta. God forbid. She\u0027s a tight ship, and she\u0027s got as good officers and crew as ever I sailed with. She has as good a chance as ever a ship had; but when I sees that \u0027ere sort of sky in these latitudes, I feels as we are in for a tough job.\" The conversation was broken off, abruptly, by the call of the first mate. \"All hands aloft to shorten sail!\" \"The bells is ringing up for the beginning of the performance, Reuben. Here goes aloft!\" The next minute the whole of the crew were climbing the shrouds, for the watch off duty were all on deck, and the order was expected; for the signs of the weather could, by this time, be read by every sailor on board. Above, the sky was still bright and blue; but around the whole circle of the horizon, a mist seemed to hang like a curtain. \"Smartly, lads, smartly,\" the captain shouted; \"don\u0027t hurry over your work, but do it with a will. \"I hope we have not left it too long, Mr. James. I have held on longer than I ought, for every mile we get away from land is an advantage, and we have been running nearly due south, ever since I noticed the first falling of the glass when we got up in the morning.\" \"I think we shall have time, sir,\" the mate said. \"We are going to have it, and no mistake, presently; but it don\u0027t seem to be coming up fast.\" \"The glass is going down rapidly,\" the captain said. \"It\u0027s down an inch already, and is still falling. \"Mr. Mason,\" he went on, to the officer in command of the detachment of marines, \"will you kindly place your men under the orders of Mr. James? I am going to send down all the upper spars, and they can be useful on deck.\" Never was the Paramatta stripped more rapidly of her sails, for every man was conscious of the urgency of the work. As soon as the sails were furled, the yards were sent down. The upper spars followed them and, in little over half an hour from the time the men began to ascend the shrouds, the Paramatta was metamorphosed. Her tall tapering masts and lofty spread of sail were gone. Every spar above the topmasts had been sent down to the deck; and she lay under close-reefed topsails, a stay sail, and a storm jib. The captain gave a sigh of relief, as the men began to descend the rigging. \"Thank God, that is safely accomplished. Now we are in readiness for whatever may come.\" He dived into his cabin, and returned almost immediately. \"The glass has fallen another half inch, Mr. James,\" he said gravely. \"I have never but once seen it as low. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he went on, addressing the passengers, who were gathered in a group, talking in low tones and anxiously watching the wall of vapour; which now seemed to rise from the water\u0027s edge and reach far up into the sky, the circle of view extending scarce half a mile in any direction; \"I must ask you to go below, at once. The storm may strike us any moment now, and when it does come it will come heavily. I should like the deck perfectly clear, and nothing to disturb my thoughts from the working of the ship.\" Reuben had not gone aloft, as he was called back, just as he began to ascend the shrouds, by the first mate, and ordered to go round the cabins and fasten the dead lights securely. When this was done, he aided the marines in nailing tarpaulins over the cabin skylights, and then went round the deck, seeing that every movable article was securely lashed. When this was done he joined Bill who, with some others, had been at work securing all the hatches. The convicts had long since been all sent below. \"Shall I send my men down, captain?\" Mr. Mason asked. \"There is no occasion for it, just at present; but you had better pass the word for all of them to hold on, when the gale strikes her. That will be the critical moment. Once past that, she will be all right till the sea begins to rise. Then you had best get them below, for we shall have the water sweeping knee deep along the waist, in no time. \"I should say send them down at once; but I know many of them have been to sea before, and may be useful in cutting away, if anything goes.\" \"She looks snug enough, captain,\" the young officer said, glancing up at the diminished spread of canvas. \"She is snug enough for any ordinary gale,\" the captain said; \"but this is not going to be an ordinary gale. When we once get her before it, it will be all right. \"Do you think we have another five minutes, Mr. James?\" \"There\u0027s no saying, sir; but I should think so. What do you want, sir?\" \"I want that top sail off her, altogether.\" \"I will do it, sir,\" the mate said and, calling Bill Hardy and two others of the best sailors, he led the way up the main shrouds. Every eye on deck was fixed on the four seamen as, rapidly but steadily, they proceeded to furl and stow the sail. There was still not a breath of wind, but a low humming noise was heard. \"Quick, Mr. James, never mind the sail. All hands on deck!\" the captain shouted; but the work was just done, and the sailors ran quickly down the ratlines on to the deck. \"Thank God!\" the captain said reverently, \"that is done.\" The ship was now under the close-reefed fore-top sail, a diminutive try sail on the mizzen, and the jib. The hum had increased to a roar, but still not a breath of wind stirred the sails. \"Look up!\" Bill said to Reuben; \"you may be at sea fifty years, and never see that again.\" Reuben looked up. Immediately overhead was a small circle of blue sky, round and round whose edge the edging of cloud seemed to be circling, with extreme velocity. The light seemed to pierce straight down onto the vessel, and she stood, pale and white, while all around her a pitchy blackness seemed to prevail. \"We are in the eye of the storm, my lad. Here it comes. Now, hold on for your life.\" In another moment it seemed to Reuben that the end of all things was come. He was pinned against the bulwark, as if by a mighty invisible hand; and the vessel heeled over and over, until the deck seemed to rise in a wall above him. Then the water poured over him and, though he still held on, he thought the vessel had capsized. Then he felt her rising beneath his feet, and his head emerged from the water. The captain, the first mate, and two seamen were at the wheel. Reuben saw the captain wave his hand, but his words were lost in the fury of the wind. The second mate, Bill Hardy, and two or three other sailors knew what was required, and hauled upon the lee brace of the fore-top-sail yard. The Paramatta was still lying nearly over on her beam ends, but gradually her head began to pay off, and she slowly righted. A minute later she was tearing directly before the gale. Scarcely had she done so, when the fore-top sail blew out of the bolt ropes, with a report that was heard even above the howl of the tempest. \"It\u0027s done its work,\" Bill shouted in Reuben\u0027s ear. \"I thought she was gone. Just a little more, and she would have turned turtle.\" The captain had used almost precisely the same words to the first officer, adding: \"She will do now, but we shall have to try to get a little more head sail on her, when the sea gets up. Call some of the hands aft, and get this try sail down. She yaws so, now the fore-top sail\u0027s gone, there is no steering her.\" This was soon done and, under bare poles, the storm jib now the only sail upon her, the Paramatta tore through the water. There was little motion, for the sea had not begun to get up, seeming to be pressed flat by the force of the wind. The captain now left the helm. Two or three of the male passengers were standing at the top of the companion, peering out. \"You can come out, gentlemen, for a bit. She is running on an even keel now, though that won\u0027t last long. No one hurt below, I hope.\" \"Two or three of us have got bruised a little, captain; and I think we have all of us got a severe fright. We thought she was over.\" \"I thought so, too,\" the captain said. \"Luckily she has got three hundred tons of iron on board, and it\u0027s all stowed at the bottom of the cargo, so that helped her up again; but it was touch and go with her, for half a minute. \"And now, gentlemen, if you will take my advice you will just look round, and then go below and turn in. Now you can do so easily. Another hour, and there will be no keeping a footing.\" The captain was right. In less than the time he named, a terrific sea had got up. The Paramatta had already made more than one circuit of the compass. There was no regularity in the sea. It seemed to rise suddenly in heaps, now striking the ship on one side, now on another, and pouring sheets of water over her bulwarks. The motion of the vessel was so tremendous that even Bill Hardy and the older seamen could only move along with the greatest difficulty to carry out the orders of the captain; while Reuben clung to the shrouds, now half buried in water, now almost hanging in the air, with the sea racing along under his feet. As yet no more sail had been put upon her, for there was no following sea. Although running almost before the gale, a slight helm was kept upon her, so as to edge her out from the centre of the storm; and the second circle of the compass took more than twice as long as the first to complete, although the vessel was proceeding with equal speed through the water. Hour after hour the sea got up—a wild, cross, broken sea—and the motion of the vessel was so terrific as to be almost bewildering to the oldest hands. There was none of the regular rise and fall of an ordinary sea; the vessel was thrown with violent jerks, now on one side, now on the other; now plunging her bow so deeply down that she seemed about to dive, head foremost, beneath the waves; now thrown bodily upwards, as if tossed up by some giant hand beneath her. The watch off duty was sent below, for there was nothing that could be done on deck; and the water swept over her in such masses as to threaten, at times, to carry everything before it. One man had had his leg broken. Several had been seriously bruised and hurt. \"This is terrible, Bill,\" Reuben said, as he went below. \"Ay, lad; I have been at sea, man and boy, over forty years, and it\u0027s the worst sea I ever saw. I expect to see her masts go out of her, before long. Nothing could stand such straining as this. You had best turn in at once. Unless I am mistaken, it will be all hands to the pumps, before long. If she hadn\u0027t been one of the tightest crafts afloat, she would have been making water at every seam, by this time.\" Reuben felt, the instant he lay down, that sleep was out of the question; for it needed all his strength to prevent himself from being thrown out of his bunk. The noise, too, was terrific—the rush and swell of the water overhead, the blows which made the ship shiver from stem to stern, the creaking of the masts, and howling of the wind. Night had set in, now. It was pitch dark in the forecastle, for the swinging lantern had been dashed so violently against the beams that the light was extinguished. Half an hour after Reuben turned in, a crash was heard. A moment later the door was opened, and there was a shout: \"The mizzen has gone! All hands to cut away the wreck!\" The watch turned out and began to make their way aft, and were soon engaged with knife and hatchet in cutting away the wreck of the mizzen which, towing behind, threatened, with each heavy following sea, to plunge into the vessel\u0027s stern. A cheer broke from the men as the last rope was cut, and the wreck floated astern. The mast had gone close to the deck, smashing the bulwark as it fell over the side. The motion of the ship was easier, for its loss. \"Mr. James,\" the captain shouted, \"we must get preventer stays, at once, upon the fore mast. The main mast may go, if it likes, and at present we shall be all the better without it, but the foremast we must keep, if we can.\" \"Ay, ay, sir. I will set about it, at once.\" Picking out a few of the best hands, the first mate proceeded about the work. \"Go and sound the well, Reuben,\" the captain said. Reuben went off at once, and returned in two or three minutes. \"There are four feet of water in it, sir.\" \"Four feet! Are you sure?\" the captain exclaimed. \"Quite sure, sir.\" The captain handed over the command of the deck to the second officer, and went below with Reuben. First wiping the rod carefully, he sounded the well. \"You are right,\" he said. \"It is three inches over the four feet. I fear that the bumping of the mizzen, before we got rid of it, must have started a butt. She could hardly have made so much water from straining.\" The captain made his way aft. The saloon was empty; the passengers, one by one, had retired to their cabins. He knocked at the doors of Mr. Mason and the chief warder. \"The ship is making water fast,\" he said. \"We must rig the main-deck pumps. I can\u0027t spare any of the crew, their hands are full. Will you set the convicts to work?\" In a few minutes the clank of the pumps was heard. Very irregularly were they worked, for it was next to impossible for the men to stand to them, with the vessel throwing herself about so wildly. The captain had remained on deck. He placed his hand on the shrouds of the main mast. One moment they hung loosely; and then, as the vessel rolled over, tightened themselves, with a sudden jerk, till they were as stiff as iron rods. He shook his head. \"Reuben, make your way up to the chief officer, and tell him that I am going to get rid of the main-top mast. Tell him to see that everything is cut free from the fore mast.\" Reuben made his way aloft with difficulty. It needed all his strength to prevent the wind from tearing him from his grasp of the shrouds, but at length he reached the fore top, where the mate was at work. He delivered the captain\u0027s message. \"Ask the captain to wait five minutes, till I get the back stay secured. I will send a man down, as soon as I am ready.\" \"You take this axe,\" the captain said, when Reuben regained the deck, \"and stand by this stay. When you see me ready to cut the other, cut at the same moment.\" In a few minutes Bill came down, with a message to the captain that all was ready. The latter raised his arm to Reuben. He waited till the vessel rolled over, and then lifted his axe. The two blows fell together on the stays. A moment later the vessel began to rise again. As the jerk came there was a crash above, and the main-top mast fell over the side, clear of the deck, having snapped off at the cap like a pipe stem. \"Thank God for that,\" the captain said, as he cut away the connections on the other side, and the spar drifted astern, \"that is off our minds.\" The loss of the main-top mast and mizzen greatly relieved the strain on the ship, and she worked much easier. In half an hour, the first officer returned on deck with his party, and reported that he had done all he could to secure the fore mast. \"The sea is becoming more regular,\" the captain said, \"now that we are getting further away from the centre of the storm. We shall soon have the waves racing behind us, like mountains, and we shall have to shake out the fore sail to keep ahead of them. Now, let us see how they are getting on below.\" The well was again sounded, and it was found that the water had gained two or three inches. \"When the motion gets a little more regular, Reuben, you must take two or three hands, and work your way aft in the hold, and try and find out where the water is coming in.\" \"I will go at once, sir, if you like.\" \"No,\" the captain replied, \"it must not be thought of. Everything will be adrift, and you would be crushed to death, to a certainty. You must wait till we are out of this tumble. If the water gains no faster than it does now, two or three hours will make no material difference, and by that time I hope we shall have got a regular sea.\" Finding that there was nothing for him to do, Reuben again turned in. The motion was still tremendous, but he could feel a sensible change from what it was before. The motion of the ship was less sudden and violent and, although she rolled tremendously, she rose each time with an easier motion. An hour later the watch turned out, and the others took their place. The wind was blowing as heavily as when the hurricane began, but the aspect of the sea had changed. It was no longer a mass of leaping, tumbling water; but was running in long waves, following each other, rising high above the vessel\u0027s stern as they overtook her. Having lashed himself to the side, he remained for an hour watching the sea. The first mate then came up to him. \"The captain thinks you might manage to get aft now. I will send Bill and Dick Whistler with you, to help you move any boxes or bales.\" Reuben went back in the forecastle and got some tools, a piece of old sailcloth, and a large bundle of oakum; and then made his way with the two sailors down into the after hold. The way in which the upper tier of cargo lay heaped against the sides showed that it would, as the captain said, have been impossible to enter while the motion was at its worst. The rolling, however, had greatly diminished; the vessel rising and falling with a regular motion, as each wave passed under her. The men each carried a lantern and, with some difficulty, made their way to the stern. \"Ay, it\u0027s somewhere about here,\" Bill said. \"I can hear the rushing of water, somewhere below. Now, the first thing is to move these bales.\" They worked for a time, and then Bill returned on deck to fetch two more hands. They brought hand spikes and bars, as the bales were wedged so tightly together that it was difficult, in the extreme, to move them. It took two hours\u0027 hard work before they reached the leak. As the captain had supposed, the head of one of the planks had been started, at the stern post, by a blow from the wreck of the mizzen; and the water was rushing in with great force. \"A few hours of this would have settled her,\" Bill said. \"All the pumps in the ship would not keep down such a leak as this.\" Reuben at once set to work, cutting a deep groove in the stern post. He butted some stout pieces of wood into this, and wedged the other ends firmly against the first rib. Then he set to work to jam down sail cloth and oakum between this barrier and the plank that had started, driving it down with a marlinespike and mallet. It was a long job, but it was securely done; and at last Reuben had the satisfaction of seeing that a mere driblet of water was making its way down, behind the stuffing, into the ship. \"That\u0027s a first-rate job, lad,\" Bill said approvingly. \"Half an hour\u0027s work once a week will keep her dry, if there is no water finds its way in anywhere else.\" Reuben went aft to the well. The pump was now working steadily, the gangs of convicts relieving each other by turns. On sounding the well, he found that the water had fallen nine inches since he had last ascertained its depth. Going on deck, he found that a misty light filled the air, and that morning was breaking. The captain had two or three times come down to the hold, to watch the progress of the work. Reuben reported to him its completion, and the fall in the water. \"Yes, it\u0027s been falling the last hour,\" the captain said. \"She will do now. But she\u0027s making water, still. Some of the seams must have opened. I have been looking her over, and can\u0027t find out where it is; and we can do nothing until the gale has blown itself out, and we can get below and shift the cargo.\" Reuben found that the fore sail had been set while he was below; and the vessel was running, some twelve knots an hour, before the wind. At one moment she was in a deep valley, then her stern mounted high on a following wave, and she seemed as if she must slide down, head foremost. Higher and higher the wave rose, sending her forward with accelerated motion; then it passed along her, and she was on a level keel on its top, and seemed to stand almost still as the wave passed from under her. In spite of the extra lashing which had been given, the hen coops, spars, and everything loose upon the decks had been swept away; and the bulwarks had, in several places, been stove in. The galley had been carried away, but the cook had just made a shift to boil a cauldron of coffee below, and a mug of this was served out to all hands. As Reuben broke a biscuit into his portion, and sipped it, he thought he had never enjoyed a meal so much. He had now been, for eighteen hours, wet through to the skin; and the coffee sent a warm glow through him. The captain ordered all hands, save a few absolutely required on deck, to turn in; and Reuben was soon in a glow of warmth beneath his blankets and, lulled by the now easy motion of the ship, was fast asleep in a few minutes. After four hours\u0027 sleep, he was again on deck. The gale was blowing as strongly as ever, three men were at the helm, and the vessel was still tearing along at great speed. Several of the male passengers were on the poop, and the contrast between the appearance of the Paramatta at the same hour on the previous day, and that which she presented now, struck Reuben very strongly. Sadly, indeed, she looked with mizzen mast gone, the main mast shortened to the cap, and all the upper spars and rigging of the fore mast gone. She was, however, making good weather of it, for her hold was now so dry that the pumps were worked only on alternate hours, and the relief afforded by the loss of all her top hamper was very great. For a week the Paramatta ran before the gale. At the end of the fourth day its force somewhat abated, but it still blew much too hard for anything to be done towards getting up fresh spars; while the lost mizzen rendered it impossible for them to bring her up into the wind. \"It\u0027s bitterly cold, Bill,\" Reuben said. \"Its been getting colder every day, but this morning it is really bitter.\" \"And no wonder, lad, seeing that we have been racing south for pretty nigh a week. We have been making a little easting, but that is all, and we are getting into the region of ice. We may see some bergs any time now.\" \"I should like to see an iceberg,\" Reuben said. \"The fewer we see of them the better,\" Bill replied, \"for they are about as nasty customers as you want to meet. I expected we should have seen them before, but this gale must have blown them south a bit. They work up with the northwesterly current, but I expect the wind will have carried them back against it. No, I don\u0027t want to see no icebergs.\" \"But if it were a very big one, we might get under its lee and repair damages a bit, Bill. Might we not?\" \"No, my lad. The lee of an iceberg ain\u0027t a place one would choose, if one could help it. There you are becalmed under it, and the berg drifting down upon you, going perhaps four knots an hour. No, the farther you keep away from icebergs the better. But if you have got to be near one, keep to windward of it. At least, that\u0027s my \u0027speryence. \"They have been having some trouble with the convicts, I hears. They worked well enough at first, as long as they knew that there was a lot of water in the hold; but since then they have been a-grumbling, and last night I hear there was a rumpus, and six of them was put in irons. That\u0027s the first of it, and the sooner the gale\u0027s over, and we shapes our course in smooth water for Sydney heads, the better I shall be pleased.\" An hour later, Bill pointed to the sky ahead. \"Do yer see nothing odd about that \u0027ere sky?\" \"No,\" Reuben replied, \"except that it\u0027s very light coloured.\" \"Ay, that\u0027s it, my lad. That\u0027s what they call the ice blink. You see if we ain\u0027t in the middle of bergs before night comes on. I have not been whaling for nothing.\" A few minutes later, the first mate was heard to be shouting orders. \"Just as I thought,\" Bill said. \"We are going to try to rig a jury mizzen, so as to help us claw off the ice, if need be.\" A spare top mast was got up from below. Guys were fixed to one end and, with the help of the marines and a party of convicts, the spar was raised alongside the stump of the mizzen mast; and was there lashed securely, the guys being fastened as stays to the bulwarks. Blocks had been tied to the top, before it was raised; and ropes rove into them; and a try sail was brought on deck, and laid ready for hoisting. The first mate ascended to the fore top, and at once hailed the deck that ice was visible ahead. The captain joined him, and for some minutes the two officers carefully examined the horizon. No sooner did the captain regain the deck than he ordered the try sail to be hoisted on the jury mast, and a haul to be given upon the braces of the fore sail, while the ship\u0027s course was laid a little north of east. \"It is lucky the wind has gone down as much as it has,\" he remarked to Mr. Hudson. \"The sea is still heavy but, if that jury mizzen stands, we shall be able to claw off the ice.\" \"Is there much of it, captain?\" \"We could see a good many bergs and, from the look of the sky, I should say there was an ice field lying beyond them. However, I think we shall do, if the wind does not freshen again. If it does, we must do our best to make a group of islands lying down to the southeast, and there refit. They are a rendezvous for whalers, in summer.\" \"Why not do so now, captain?\" \"I would, if it were not for the convicts. But, unless as a last resource, I would not run the risk of touching at any island with them on board. As long as we are at sea they are comparatively harmless and, unless there is gross carelessness on the part of their guard, there is little fear of an outbreak. But once let them get on land, the matter is changed altogether. They are nearly three to one as against the warders, marines, and crew; and I would not run the risk, on any account, if it can be possibly avoided. No, no, Mr. Hudson, unless it be a matter of life and death, we will put in nowhere till we are in Sydney harbour.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3167/86891.html","bookId":867,"book":{"id":867,"title":"A Final Reckoning","description":"简介： In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers.
