{"id":10031,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 17: In Pursuit.","content":"The last thing before the party started, Reuben went into the house. Mr. Barker was going to remain behind. He was past middle life, and the expedition was likely to be a very toilsome one; and Reuben was glad when he said that he thought six days\u0027 severe riding would be rather too much for him, and that he should constitute himself the guardian of the ladies. \"My wife has arranged to stay here, while you are away; so I shall ride over to my place and see that all is going on straight, every day, and sleep here at night.\" \"Well, ladies,\" Reuben said, as he entered the room, \"we are just off. So I will say goodbye to you; and I hope that, on my return, I shall find Mr. Donald much better. I am sure that Mr. Ruskin would not have left, this morning, unless he felt that he had quite turned the corner. Pray take care of yourselves, while we are away. You know I don\u0027t want to alarm you, but pray be careful. I shall not feel comfortable, as to your safety, till I have that villain safely in my hands.\" \"Goodbye, Captain Whitney. You know you have all our best wishes,\" Mrs. Barker said. \"We will take care of ourselves, till we hear that you have destroyed the band; and above all, its leader.\" \"The news that you have done so,\" Mrs. Donald said, \"will do more, I think, for my husband, than anything in the way of doctoring. But take care of yourself, Captain Whitney. I know from what Mr. Barker said that, although you make light of your expedition, it is a dangerous one. He said the police had never ventured so far in the bush, and you may expect sharp fighting with the blacks.\" \"We may have a brush with them,\" Reuben said lightly; \"but do not be anxious about us. We are a very strong party, and you need have no fear of the result. \"Goodbye, Miss Ellison; pray be careful till I return.\" The last words were said in an undertone, as he held her hand. \"Goodbye, Captain Whitney,\" she said. \"God bless you all, and bring you safely back.\" Two minutes later, the party rode off. Jim was, like the rest, mounted, as they would travel fast. Four led horses carried provisions; for they would not, as before, find food by the way. It was two o\u0027clock in the day when they started, and they rode thirty miles before they halted, for the night, at a water hole. They had seen no signs of natives during the day, but Reuben at once posted four men as sentries. It was a merry party round the fire, for all were in high spirits at the prospect of an expedition to a point far beyond that to which any white men, with the exception of fugitives from justice, had penetrated; and they were delighted with the thought of putting a stop, at last, to the operations of the band who had so long been a scourge to the settlement. Mr. Blount, Dick Caister, and several others who had formed part of the last expedition were of the party; and the confidence which these felt in their young leader, and in the sagacity of his native follower, communicated itself to those who had not formed part of the previous expedition. \"Must start early,\" Jim said to Reuben, the last thing. \"Long way to water. Ride all day, not get dere before dark.\" They rode rapidly for some time, after starting, so as to allow the horses to take it easily, during the heat of the day, when there was a halt of three hours; but in the afternoon they quickened their pace again, and men and horses were jaded and done up when, just as the sun was setting, they arrived at their destination. \"How that black fellow of yours finds his way through this bush is a perfect marvel to me,\" Dick Caister said. \"The country has become more undulating, this afternoon; but the first thirty miles were almost perfectly level, and I could see nothing, whatever, that could serve as an index, except of course the sun. Still, that is only a guide as to the general direction. It must have been nine or ten years since that fellow was here, and yet he led us as straight as if he was making for a church steeple.\" \"It seems to be a sort of instinct,\" Reuben said, \"although possibly, for the last part of the distance, he may have seen signs of the passage of the natives. As far as I can understand, he tells me at this time of year there is no other water hole, within a long distance; so that naturally there will be many natives making for it. I am glad there are not any of them here, now. \"Why isn\u0027t that horse hobbled like the rest?\" Reuben asked suddenly. \"Whose is it?\" \"That is the one your black fellow rode, sir,\" Sergeant O\u0027Connor said. \"Jim, where are you?\" Reuben called, but no reply came. \"What has become of him, I wonder?\" Reuben said. \"Has anyone seen him, since we rode up?\" \"He jumped off, the instant we came here,\" one of the policemen replied; \"and said to me, \u0027Look after captain horse,\u0027 and I haven\u0027t seen anything of him since.\" \"There has been somebody here, sir,\" another policeman said, coming up. \"Here\u0027s the remains of a fire, behind this bush.\" \"Yes,\" Mr. Blount said, examining them, and pulling out a brand that was still glowing. \"Do you see, a lot of sand has been thrown over it. Whoever was here must have seen us coming, and tried to extinguish the fire when they caught sight of us.\" \"That is most unfortunate,\" Reuben said. \"The fellows must have made off, to carry the news of our coming to their friends. However, it\u0027s too late to do anything now. It\u0027s already getting dark, and they must have got a quarter of an hour\u0027s start. We have taken quite enough out of the horses, and can do no more with them, if they have to travel tomorrow; but I would give a year\u0027s pay if this hadn\u0027t happened. \"Well, there\u0027s nothing to do for it but to light our fires, and camp.\" The knowledge that they had been seen, and that the news would be carried to those of whom they were in search, acted as a great damper on the spirits of the party; and the camp was much more quiet and subdued than it had been, on the previous evening. \"All is not quite lost,\" Reuben said when, two hours later, he found that Jim was still absent from the camp. \"I can only account for his stealing away from us, in that manner, by supposing that he must either have caught sight of the natives, or come upon their trail; and at once set off in pursuit. I don\u0027t see what it could be, otherwise.\" \"But if he saw them, why didn\u0027t he tell you, Whitney?\" Mr. Blount said. \"Tired as our horses were, they could have got up a gallop for a bit.\" \"Yes, but for a very short distance,\" Dick Caister put in; \"and as it was getting dusk, if the blacks had had anything like a start, we could not have overtaken them before it had got quite dark. Those blacks can run like the wind. It takes a well-mounted man to overtake them.\" An hour after the party had lain down, one of the sentries challenged; and the answer which came back, \"All right, me Jim,\" at once brought everyone to their feet. \"Well, Jim, what is it? Where have you been?\" Reuben asked. \"Jim hungry.\" \"That you may be quite sure,\" Dick Caister said, with a laugh. \"Was there ever a native who wasn\u0027t hungry; unless he had stuffed himself, half an hour before?\" \"Yes, I kept some supper for you, Jim,\" Reuben said; \"but before you begin to eat, just tell me if everything is all right.\" \"Everyting all right,\" Jim said, squatting himself beside the still glowing fire, and beginning to eat. Reuben knew, by experience, that it was of no use questioning him until he had finished; and he therefore waited patiently, although one or two of the settlers grumbled at being kept waiting for the news. When Jim had finished his meal, he looked round. Reuben knew what he was expecting, and handed him a hornful of rum and water. The black took a draught; and then, without any further delay, began to tell his story. He had, while still some distance from the halting place, seen a light smoke coming up, and was sure that a party was already there. \"But why did you not tell us, Jim?\" Reuben interrupted. \"We might have galloped on, and caught them.\" \"No, sah, no catch dem; horses too tired, black fellow run away, when see white men coming. Dat no do at all. Only one way to do. Let \u0027em tink dat no one saw dem, else dey run and run, all de way to Bobitu. \"When get near camp, Jim see dat smoke not come up, know de black fellow see white man and put out um fire. When Jim come here he jump off hoss, find fire, and follow de track. Dey four men; one go one way, one go anoder, two men go straight on. Dey go on to tell Bobitu, de oders go to black fellows in de bush. Jim not care for dem, follow de two.\" \"But how could you follow them, in the dark?\" \"Jim were sure de way dey go, dat enough for Jim. He suppose dat dey \u0027top after a bit; and when dey see de white men all \u0027top quiet at de water hole, and light fire, dey tink it all right. No make hurry, perhaps \u0027top and light a fire demselves. \"So Jim go on quiet for two, tree hour; den at last he see fire, sure \u0027nough. He crawl up quiet and see two black fellow dar, and hear what \u0027em say. Dey tired, make long walk today to water hole; say no hurry, white men all go sleep round fire, not go on till sun get up, so dey stop for two, tree hour to rest demselves. \"Jim get quite close and jump up, den cut off one black fellow head with sword, run sword through de body of other, finish \u0027em both, and den come back to camp.\" \"Well done, indeed, Jim!\" Reuben exclaimed, and a chorus of satisfaction rose from all the party at hearing that the men—who, had they reached the bush rangers, would have given the alarm, and so enabled them to make their escape before the expedition arrived—had been killed. The news, however, that two of the party had escaped, and might bring the blacks down upon them before morning, necessitated an increase of precautions. Reuben at once divided the force into four parties, each consisting of five constables and seven settlers. One party were at once placed on watch, and were to be relieved in two hours\u0027 time. \"I not tink dey come before morning, sah,\" Jim said. \"No water hole near here. Tomorrow plenty black fellow come.\" \"All right, Jim. We don\u0027t care for them, in the daylight; and now that I know the bush rangers won\u0027t be alarmed, I don\u0027t mind.\" Jim\u0027s prediction proved correct. The night passed off quietly, and the party again started at daylight. The country became more and more broken, as they proceeded. The undulations became hills. Some of these were so steep that all had to dismount, and lead their horses up. \"Is Bobitu\u0027s camp among these hills, Jim?\" \"Ober toder side, sah. Him place in valley, toder side; bush, plenty game for black fellow.\" \"How far is it to this valley, Jim?\" Jim\u0027s ideas of figures were but vague, and he could only say that they would get there somewhere about sunset. \"That would be a bad time to get there, Jim. We must halt, a mile or two this side of them; and you must lead half the party round, so as to cut off their retreat, even if we don\u0027t attack them till the morning. On their fresh horses, those fellows will gallop right away from us, if they once get a start. \"There is no fear, I hope, of any of the other blacks getting there before us, and giving the alarm?\" Jim shook his head. \"No. We come straight from water hole. Black fellow go round long way. No fear dey get dere. Dey fight when we go back.\" \"That\u0027s all right. Bobitu\u0027s fellows, and the bush rangers, will be quite enough to tackle at once. As for the others, we will make short work of them, if they venture to attack us on the march back. They fight pluckily enough against men on foot, because they know they can make off when they like; but they can\u0027t stand a charge of horsemen.\" Although not so long as the journey on the preceding day, the men were heartily glad when, at about four o\u0027clock in the afternoon, the halt was called, and they heard that the place where the bush rangers were supposed to be was but four miles away. After some consultation, it was decided that Jim should lead half the band—consisting of ten constables under O\u0027Connor, and fifteen colonists—round through the hills, to a position near the mouth of the valley in which the blacks and bush rangers were likely to be; and that, when he had posted them there, he should come back again to their present halting place, and lead forward the party under Reuben. \"Mind,\" Reuben said, before the others started, \"we don\u0027t want to attack the blacks, unless they show fight. Our object is the bush rangers. Jim says that, by what he heard, they have got some sort of houses they have built there. Let us make straight for them. If the blacks attack, drive them off; but we can settle with them, afterwards. The great point is to capture or kill the bush rangers.\" All agreed to this, for although the blacks gave great trouble, by driving off the sheep and cattle, and sometimes killing the shepherds, there was not the same feeling of hatred entertained for them as for the bush rangers. It was felt to be natural that the natives should resent the occupation of their hunting grounds; and although they were shot down without mercy in fair fight, or if overtaken while carrying off cattle, there was no active feeling of animosity against them; and they were generally kindly treated, when they called unarmed at the stations, and asked for food. Against the bush rangers, on the other hand, a deadly hatred was felt by the colonists; and the fact that these were constantly aided, by the ticket-of-leave labourers, increased the hostility with which they were regarded. Jim left his horse behind him, when he started with his party; saying that coming back at night, in the dark, he would rather be without it. After their comrades had set out, those who remained behind posted two men as sentries; and then, as soon as they had cooked and eaten a meal, laid themselves down to sleep, until the time should come for their advance. It was just midnight when Jim returned. He reported that he had seen no blacks by the way, and that he believed he had posted his party without their being observed. He himself, instead of returning by the same route that he had taken them, had come straight up the valley. There were, he said, two huts which had been built by the bush rangers; and these were now occupied by them. There were great fires blazing, and he thought that the natives had probably only arrived there that evening. He had got near enough to find that they were in a high state of delight, at the presents which their white friends had brought them. \"Did you catch sight of any of the bush rangers, Jim?\" Reuben asked. \"Two ob dem came out and spoke to black fellows at fire, but too far off to see which dey were.\" An hour before daybreak the party moved forward, and halted within half a mile of the bush rangers\u0027 camp. There they stopped, till they could see the sunlight touch the top of the hill at the right-hand side of the valley. This was the signal agreed upon and, mounting, they rode forward at full speed. Just as they got within sight of the huts, they heard a wild shouting, followed instantly by the crack of rifles. Another minute, and they had reached the scene and joined the other party, who had made straight to the huts. The blacks, awakened suddenly as they were sleeping round the embers of their fires, had hastily thrown a volley of spears, and had darted away among the bushes. \"Surrender, in the queen\u0027s name!\" Reuben shouted, \"and I promise you that you shall be taken down, and have a fair trial.\" The answer came in the flash of a rifle, from the window of one of the huts; and a constable immediately behind Reuben fell dead, with the ball through his head. \"Dismount!\" Reuben shouted, \"and break in the doors.\" With a shout, the men threw themselves from their horses and rushed at the doors of the huts. \"Sergeant O\u0027Connor,\" Reuben said; \"do you, with six of your men, keep up a fire at the windows. Don\u0027t let a man show himself there. \"Let ten of the others look after the horses. We shall have the blacks back, in no time.\" So saying, he ran forward and joined those who were battering at the doors. Several of them had brought stout axes with them, and the doors speedily gave way. There was a rush forward. Mr. Blount fell dead, and Dick Caister\u0027s shoulder was broken by a bullet; but there was no check, as the colonists poured into the huts. There was a short sharp fight, but in two minutes it was over. Three of the gang had been shot, as they leapt from the windows. Four more lay dead, or dying, in the huts. One of them had thrown down his arms, and shouted for mercy. He had been knocked down and stunned, by the butt end of a rifle; but was otherwise unwounded. Short as was the fight, it had given time to the blacks to rally. Their shouts were ringing in the air, and the spears were flying thickly as the party, having finished their work, rushed outside again, to assist the constables who were guarding the horses. \"Pour a volley into the bushes,\" Reuben shouted; \"then mount, and charge them.\" The order was executed and, in a minute, the horsemen were dashing hither and thither among the bushes, shooting down with their pistols the blacks who resisted, or dealing tremendous blows among them with their hunting whips. The charge was irresistible, and in five minutes the main body of the blacks were flying, at full speed, up the steep hillsides. The victors soon gathered round the huts. Several men and horses had been wounded with spears, but none of the injuries were of a serious character. \"Well, how about the prisoners?\" Reuben asked the sergeant, who had arrived before him. \"There\u0027s only one prisoner, sir. All the rest are accounted for.\" \"Is it their captain?\" \"I don\u0027t know, sir. I have never set eyes on him; but if he\u0027s a young chap, as they say, it ain\u0027t him.\" \"Jim,\" Reuben said, \"just go round and examine the bodies, and see which of them is the captain.\" Jim returned in a couple of minutes. \"None of dem ain\u0027t him, sah. He not dere.\" Reuben started. \"Are you quite sure, Jim?\" \"Quite sure, sah.\" \"Are you sure none of them escaped, sergeant?\" \"I am quite sure of that, sir. No one came out of either of the doors, and there were only three who tried to bolt through the windows, and we accounted for them all. Perhaps that chap who is prisoner can tell you where to find the captain. It\u0027s a bad job, indeed, if he has escaped.\" \"Is the man recovering his senses?\" \"Yes, sir, he\u0027s just coming round.\" Reuben stepped into the hut. The escape of Thorne destroyed all the satisfaction which his success would have given him. He had good reason to know the fiendish malignity of the man and, in spite of the warnings he had given Kate Ellison, and his strict orders to the police on guard, he felt a thrill of anxiety, now that he was aware her enemy was still at large. The prisoner was sitting up, in a corner of the hut; a policeman, with drawn sword, standing near him. \"Where is your leader?\" Reuben asked sternly. \"The man you call Fothergill.\" \"He went away yesterday morning,\" the man said, with a grin of satisfaction. \"You haven\u0027t caught him yet; and you will hear more of him, before you do.\" \"Where was he going?\" Reuben demanded. \"You won\u0027t get nothing out of me,\" the fellow said. \"He\u0027s been a good mate, and a true, and I ain\u0027t going to put you bloodhounds on his scent. He\u0027s gone a-wooing, that\u0027s where he\u0027s gone, and that won\u0027t help you much.\" Reuben at once went outside, and called the settlers round him. \"I am sorry to say,\" he said, \"that the leader of the party has got away. He rode off yesterday morning, and although the prisoner we have taken did not say where he has gone, I have not the least doubt he has ridden back to the Donalds, to try and carry out his threat to return for Miss Ellison. \"Therefore, gentlemen, may I ask you to start homeward, at once. The horses have only done a few miles and, if we press forward, we may manage to get to our camp of the evening before last. We have no more to do here, except to see if there are any valuables hidden in the huts, and set fire to them. \"I expect that we shall have fighting with the blacks, on our way back. Those parties the two fellows who got away went to fetch will, likely enough, bar our way. If it were not for that, I should ride on by myself; but my duty is to stop with my men until, at any rate, we have passed the place where the blacks are likely to attack us. That done, I shall push on. It is annoying, indeed, to think that that fellow must have passed us somewhere on the way, yesterday.\" The settlers agreed, at once. They all sympathized with Reuben, in his disappointment at the escape of the leader of the bush rangers; and regretted the matter deeply, on their own account. They were, too, now that the work was done, anxious to be off; not only because they wished to return to their stations, but because they felt that their position was a dangerous one. They had penetrated, to a distance hitherto unattempted, into the country of the natives; and they knew that these would gather round them, like hornets, on their return march. Ten minutes were spent in the search of the huts. The police probed the ground with their swords, and closely examined the walls. They found, under some sheepskins in one corner, a bag containing upwards of two hundred pounds; which was doubtless the amount which the bush rangers had brought back with them, from their last plundering expedition, and had not yet been added to their main store, wherever that might be. This, however, was a welcome find to the police, and they abandoned the idea of searching further; and were about to set fire to the hut, when the prisoner said: \"Lookee here! I may as well tell you where the lot is hidden. It may do me good, when it comes to the trial; and you may as well have it, as for it to lay there. You dig up the ground in front of that tree, behind the hut, and you will find it.\" Five minutes later a large leather bag, containing a considerable quantity of gold and notes, and a number of watches, chains, and other trinkets, was brought to light. \"Don\u0027t stop to count the money now,\" Reuben said. \"Fasten it on one of the horses, and let us be off. \"Sergeant, let Jones ride beside the prisoner, and be responsible for his safety. See that his hands are tied behind him, and his ankles tied securely to stirrup leathers. Let four men take charge of the eight horses of these bush rangers. Do you ride ahead with four others, and keep a sharp lookout as you go. Don\u0027t press the horses, but we must go at a smart pace, for we have a long day\u0027s march before us. It is fully sixty miles to the water hole where we camped, the night before last.\" A few minutes later, the party were in motion. Although disappointed at the escape of the leader of the band, they were well satisfied with the result of the expedition, and at the small amount of loss at which it had been accomplished. There was general regret at the death of Mr. Blount; but two lives were considered to be but a small loss, for the capture of so strong a body of bush rangers; who, knowing that they fought with ropes round their neck, always made a desperate resistance. Half the journey was accomplished without incident, and Reuben felt satisfied that they would, at least, have no trouble with the tribe they had scattered in the morning. The speedy start that they had made had taken them beyond their pursuit; and if attacked, it would be by other tribes. After an hour\u0027s halt, to feed the horses and cook some meat for themselves, the party proceeded again. Another fifteen miles were passed; then Reuben saw the sergeant, with the little party ahead, suddenly draw rein. He galloped forward to them. \"What is it, sergeant?\" \"I am pretty sure I saw a black fellow\u0027s head, over that rock, sir. It\u0027s a nasty piece of ground. I noticed it yesterday, as I came along. It would be the worst place to be attacked in of any we have passed. If the blacks are here in force, they know what they are doing.\" Reuben examined the position. It was certainly a nasty place to be attacked in. The valley was narrow, and thickly strewn with boulders of all sizes, which had rolled down from the hillsides. Among these the bush grew thickly, and it was only down a narrow path in the centre, formed by a winter stream, now dry, that horsemen could pass. \"I don\u0027t think it would do to make a bolt through that, sir,\" the sergeant said, shaking his head. \"We could only ride two abreast and, if they are strong, we should be riddled with spears before we got through; and there\u0027s no charging them, among those stones and bush.\" \"That is so, sergeant. We shall have to dismount, and drive them out foot by foot. There\u0027s nothing else for it.\" By this time all the party had come up, and Reuben explained to them the situation. All at once agreed that they could do nothing on horseback, on such ground. The whole party therefore dismounted. The horses were tied to bushes, and the prisoner securely fastened to a tree. Then, rifle in hand, they moved forward. The sergeant\u0027s eye had not deceived him for, as they approached the spot where the boulders and bush grew thickest, a shower of spears was thrown, and the native cry rose shrill in the air. The party were advancing in skirmishing order; and most of them threw themselves down, or dodged behind rocks, as the blacks rose to throw their spears and, a moment later, the rifles cracked out. Several of the blacks fell, and the rest disappeared among the bushes. \"Make your way forward, steadily and carefully. Let each man watch his neighbour, to the right and left, and keep in line as much as you can.\" The fight now commenced in earnest, but the settlers and police gradually made their way forward. Not only had they the advantage in weapons; but the fact that they were able to fire while lying down, or stooping, gave them an immense advantage over the blacks; who had to expose themselves when rising to throw their spears, or take aim with their bows. Several times, emboldened by their superior numbers, the blacks attempted a rush; but the heavy fire from rifle and pistol which greeted them, each time, sent them back in diminished numbers. At last the resistance became feebler, as the natives, seeing that they were being driven out of their shelter, began to slink off; so as not to be exposed to the fire of the white men, in the comparatively open ground beyond. Many, however, were not quick enough, and were shot down as they scaled the steep hillside. The party of whites gathered, and compared notes. Many had received wounds more or less severe, but none of a nature to prevent them from continuing their journey. They quickly returned to their horses and, mounting, continued their way. \"There is no fear of any farther attack, I should think, sergeant.\" \"I should think not, sir. The beggars must have had enough of it. They must have lost from forty to fifty men.\" Two hours later, the party arrived at the halting place. \"Now, sergeant,\" Reuben said, \"I shall hand over the command to you; and shall ride on at once, with my boy. I am most anxious about the man who has escaped. I shall take four of the bush rangers\u0027 horses. They have not been ridden and, having had three or four days\u0027 rest, are comparatively fresh. The fellow has had only one day\u0027s start and, if I push straight on, I may be there before him.\" Reuben briefly bade adieu to his friends, while Jim was transferring the saddles to two of the bush rangers\u0027 horses and, leading two others, they started together in darkness. Changing saddles every ten miles, they rode on till past midnight, when they halted; for the horses, accustomed as they were to long journeys, were now completely broken down, and Jim and his master could scarce keep their seats. \"Too much long,\" Jim said, as he threw himself down, after taking off the saddles and hobbling the horses; \"too much long, sah.\" \"It is long, Jim,\" Reuben replied. \"People in England would hardly believe horses could go a hundred miles in a day, even if led a part of the distance. Another fifty miles will take us to Donald\u0027s. It is about twenty miles to the water hole where we camped, the first night; and that was about thirty miles from the station.\" \"Shall Jim light a fire, sah?\" \"No, Jim, it isn\u0027t worth while. There is some cold meat in my haversack, if you are hungry; but I am too tired to eat. If there are any natives prowling about, a fire might bring them round on us.\" \"No tink black fellows near, massa.\" \"I don\u0027t think so either, but I don\u0027t want to run the risk, Jim; besides, I am sure neither of us can be trusted to keep watch.\" Reuben, in spite of his fatigue, was some time before he could get off to sleep. The thought that probably Tom Thorne was, at that time, camped at the water hole twenty miles ahead; and that, in the morning, his horse would be far fresher than those he had ridden, was maddening to him. At one time he thought of getting up, and pursuing his way on foot; but he was stiff in every limb, and felt that the journey was beyond him. Moreover, if the bush ranger had taken some other line, and was not camping there, he would have no means of pursuing his journey. At the first gleam of daylight they were afoot. The saddles were put on the horses, and they continued their way. Reuben soon found, however, that the five hours he had rested had been insufficient to restore the horses and, even by riding them alternately, he could get them but little beyond a walk. On arriving at the water hole, the remains of a fire were found. Jim examined the ground carefully, and found the tracks of a horse; and was of opinion that the rider had started three or four hours previously. Reuben carried a large flask of spirits and, having poured what remained in it down the throats of the horses, and given them a drink at the pool, he again pressed on. Ten miles farther, he arrived at the first outlying station. The owner of this had not joined in the expedition, being a married man, and unwilling to leave his wife in such an exposed position. But upon Reuben\u0027s arrival he at once agreed to lend him two fresh horses, and to take care of those which Reuben brought with him. While the settler was driving them in from the paddock, his wife busied herself in preparing two huge bowls of bread and milk. These were thankfully swallowed by Reuben and Jim and, five minutes later, they started on the fresh horses. It was indeed a relief, to Reuben\u0027s anxiety, to find himself again flying over the ground at a rapid gallop, after the slow and tedious pace at which he had travelled since morning. His spirits rose, and the fears which had oppressed him seemed lifted, as if by magic. He assured himself that he had no cause for anxiety, for that the two constables would assuredly be on the watch, and Kate had promised not to venture beyond the doors of the house until his return. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3167/86900.html","bookId":867,"book":{"id":867,"title":"A Final Reckoning","description":"简介： In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers.
