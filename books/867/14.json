{"id":10027,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 13: Bush Rangers.","content":"As soon as it became dark, the journey was renewed. \"Now, Jim, you must keep your eyes well open,\" Reuben said. \"There is no saying when we may come upon them, now.\" \"I tink dey not berry far off, sah. Dose sheep too tired to go far. Black fellow glad to stop and rest, when he see no one coming after him. \"De ground more up and down here. Must no make noise. May come upon dem sudden.\" It was nearly midnight when Jim suddenly halted. \"What is it, Jim?\" Reuben asked, in a low voice. Jim stood sniffing the air. \"Me smell fire, captain.\" Reuben sniffed the air, but shook his head. \"I don\u0027t smell anything, Jim.\" \"I smell him, sah, sure enough; not very close, perhaps, but in de air.\" \"What is it, Captain Whitney?\" Mr. Blount asked, as he came forward and joined them. \"Jim says he smells fire, but I can\u0027t smell it.\" \"Oh, you can trust Jim\u0027s nose,\" the settler said. \"It is wonderful how keen is the scent of these natives. They are like dogs in that respect; and can perceive the smell of a fire, when the wind brings it down to them, miles away.\" \"Dis way now, sah,\" Jim said, turning off to the left, at right angles to the course which they had been pursuing. \"Smell come down the wind, dat\u0027s sartin. We follow him far enough, we sure to catch dem.\" For fully two miles, Reuben followed the black without speaking. Then he said: \"I don\u0027t smell any smoke, Jim. Are you quite sure you are right about it?\" \"Quite sure, sah. De smoke much stronger than he was. Some of dese bushes make very sharp smell; can smell him very far away.\" \"That\u0027s all right, Jim, on we go then. I must take your word for it.\" After another half-an-hour\u0027s walking, Reuben thought that he too could smell an odour of burning wood and, soon afterwards, he became convinced that it was so. The ground on which they were crossing was slightly undulated and, on nearing the crest of one of the slight rises, Jim said: \"De smoke am getting strong now, sah; and Jim can hear de bleating of de sheep. If de captain will wait here, Jim will go on ahead, and find out where dey lie.\" \"But perhaps you won\u0027t be able to find us again.\" \"Der no fear of dat, sah. But if I not come straight back, I give a little whistle-like this—when I get on to a rise; and if the captain answer in just the same way, then I come straight back to him.\" So saying, Jim glided away in the darkness; while Reuben gave the word for the men to halt, and lie down till his return. There was, however, no occasion for a signal for, in little over half an hour from the time of Jim\u0027s leaving, he rejoined them again; his coming being unnoticed until he stood among them, so noiseless were his footsteps. \"We hab dem dis time, sure enough, captain.\" \"Why, is that you, Jim? You quite startled me. Well, what is your news?\" \"De black fellows and de sheep are a little over a mile away, sah. Dey got a big fire down in a bottom. Some of dem eating still, but most of dem fast asleep round de fire.\" \"How many are there of them?\" \"About fifty, sah—at least, dat about the number Jim saw. I expect I was right when I tell you dat there was well nigh a hundred, at fust. Some ob them go off wid de sheep, de odder way, and we kill over twenty in dat fight.\" \"Do you think we killed so many as that, Jim?\" \"I went round, sah, and counted sixteen of dem; and some sure to have crawl away and die in de bush. Dere were over twenty killed altogether, for sure; and I specks dat some more hab left de party today, and gone off wid dere share of de sheep to der people.\" \"Well, what do you think, Mr. Blount—shall we attack them tonight, or wait till morning?\" \"I should say wait till morning, certainly,\" the settler said. \"We might shoot a few if we attack them now, but the rest would be all off, at the first flash of our gun; and we should never get another shot. I think our best plan would be to remain where we are, for another couple of hours—it is two o\u0027clock now—then Jim will guide us to the place, and we can take up our position as close as we can get, and wait for daylight.\" \"There is no fear of their making a move before it is light, Jim?\" \"No, sah. Dey tink dey am safe now, and eat one big feast. Dey not move till light, sartain.\" \"Very well, Mr. Blount, then we will do as you say. When we get near them we will divide into four parties. You, with four men, shall move up close to the sheep, Sergeant O\u0027Connor, with four others, shall work up from the other end of the bottom. Five others shall make a detour, and get right on the other side of their fire; and I, with the other three and Jim, who you see has got one of the constables\u0027 rifles and ammunition, will come down on them from this side. \"Jim will place all the parties, taking them by turns, as near the fire as he thinks safe; and will then return to me. Only, as we shall attack them from four sides, let everyone be careful about his shooting; otherwise we shall have casualties from our own shots. \"All will remain quiet until I fire. Then a general volley must be poured in, with bullet and buckshot; and when the rifles and guns are empty, go right at them with pistol and sword.\" The plan was carried out as arranged and, before daybreak, the four parties were lying in the positions allotted to them, within forty yards of the blacks. A few of these were seen sitting by the fire, the rest were all asleep. Gradually the light began to creep over the sky and, as it became lighter, there was a movement among the blacks. As soon as he could see perfectly, Reuben was about to fire in the air; for he did not like to fire at unsuspecting men, in spite of the deeds of blood and rapine they had performed in the settlement. Presently, however, his eye fell upon one of the treacherous trackers, who had so nearly brought destruction upon them. He levelled his rifle and fired, and the man fell dead in his tracks. As the rest of the blacks leapt to their feet, a volley from nineteen guns was poured into them—followed by seven or eight more, as most of the settlers were armed with double-barrelled guns; a few buckshot being dropped into each barrel, over the bullets. Then came the sharp cracks of the pistols, as the whites rushed down to the assault. The natives attempted no resistance. Panic stricken at the sudden appearance of the foe, whom they imagined by this time far back on their way to the settlements; and paralysed by the slaughter made by the first volley, they thought only of flight. A few caught up their spears and waddies, as they made a dash for the bushes, and strove to effect their escape between the parties advancing on each side of them; but the latter were now close at hand and, for a minute or two, a fight took place between the whites, with their clubbed muskets, and the natives with their spears and waddies. But it was soon over, for the natives only fought to escape and, as soon as they saw an opening, bounded away into the bushes. Only one of the assailants was killed, but several were more or less severely wounded by the spears; while no less than thirty-four of the blacks were killed. The victors made no attempt at pursuit but, as soon as the last of the natives had escaped, they gathered to ascertain what loss had taken place, on their side. \"Poor Phillips is killed,\" Mr. Blount said, as he examined the body. \"The spear has gone right through his throat. Fortunately he was a single man. He has only been out here a few months, and was staying down at Dick Caister\u0027s.\" \"Poor Tom,\" Dick said, in feeling tones. \"He was a capital young fellow, and I am deeply sorry. Fortunately he has left no one behind to grieve more than I do for him, for he lost his father and mother shortly before he came out, and was alone in the world.\" \"I am thankful it\u0027s no worse,\" Mr. Blount said. \"We have given the blacks a terrible lesson. I think, as far as they are concerned, we can sleep in peace for a long time. Of course we have not done with them, for they are very revengeful; but a blow like this will render them careful, for a long time, how they attack us. \"How many of them have fallen?\" \"Thirty-four,\" Reuben said. \"Jim has just been counting them up. \"Now, Mr. Blount, we will have another of your sheep for breakfast, and then we\u0027ll be off.\" The sheep had scattered somewhat, at the alarm of the fire, but were soon driven together again. One was caught and killed, and slices of the meat were stuck up on ramrods, and were soon frizzling before the fire. \"Well, Mr. Blount, how many sheep do you think there are here?\" \"I have just been looking them over,\" the settler replied, \"and I should say there must be nearly twelve hundred; so that, allowing for two hundred driven off in the other direction, and a hundred dropped by the way, the whole flock are accounted for. I am indeed obliged to you, and to my friends here. I never expected to see a tail of them again, when I found they were off.\" \"I am very glad you have recovered so many of them,\" Reuben said, \"and still more, that we have given the blacks such a lesson. We will, as soon as we have finished, be on the march. Jim will go on ahead at once, as we agreed; and he tells me will get to the stream where the horses are before night, and will start out with them at once, so that we may be able to meet them tomorrow, early. I fancy our water bottles are all getting very low, but we can hold on for today.\" As soon as he had finished eating, Jim started off at a run, which Reuben knew he would keep up for hours. The body of young Phillips was buried; and then, collecting the flock and driving it before them, the rest started upon their return. The sheep could not travel fast, for many of them were footsore with their hurried journey; but they had found plenty of nourishment in the grass at the bottoms, and in the foliage of the bushes and, being so supplied, had suffered little from thirst. Jim, before starting, had pointed out the exact line they were to follow, and this they kept by compass. With only one or two short halts, they kept on until nightfall and, leaving the sheep in a grassy bottom, lit their fire on the crest above it, in order that its flame might serve as a guide to Jim, should he get back with the horses before daylight. There was but little talking, before each stretched himself at length before the fire. They had been twenty-four hours without sleep, and all were now suffering severely from thirst. The last drops in the water bottles had been emptied, early in the day; and they were parched not only by the heat of the sun, but by the stifling dust raised by the flock as they travelled. There had been but little supper eaten. Indeed, most of them contented themselves with chewing pieces of raw meat, to satisfy their thirst rather than their hunger. Although they had no fear of the return of the natives, Reuben thought it only prudent to keep watch, and each of the party had half an hour on sentry duty. The day was just beginning to break, when the man on guard exclaimed: \"I can hear the trampling of horses!\" The news brought everyone to their feet, and in a few minutes the two constables and Jim rode up, driving before them the horses of the rest of the party. \"Well done, Jim!\" Reuben exclaimed. \"Now, the first thing, get one of the water skins off.\" One of the skins was unfastened in a minute and, after copious draughts, everyone felt refreshed and ready for work again. \"We cannot start for a few hours,\" Reuben said. \"The horses must have come over forty miles, and won\u0027t be fit to travel till the afternoon; fortunately there is plenty of grass for them in the bottom. And now that my thirst is allayed, I begin to discover that I am hungry.\" There was a general chorus of assent. The fire was made up again. The men went down to the bottom, and killed and brought up a sheep; and all were soon engaged in making up for their twenty-four hours\u0027 fast. In the afternoon a start was made; but although they travelled all night, they did not reach the stream until the following afternoon, as they were obliged to accommodate their pace to that of the sheep. The following morning Reuben rode forward to the settlements, leaving Mr. Blount, with two of his friends, to come on with the flock at his leisure. At the first farm he reached Reuben heard that, as he feared, the bush rangers had taken advantage of so many of the settlers being away to recommence their attacks. At the first two houses they visited, they had found the inmates on the watch, and had moved off without making any attack. At the third they had surprised and killed a settler, his wife, and two hired men, and had sacked and burned the house. Reuben learned that some of the police had gone off in pursuit. Leaving his horse to the care of the settler, Reuben borrowed a fresh animal and rode off to the scene of the outrage, which was some thirty miles distant. Just as he arrived there he met the party of eight police, who had been in pursuit of the bush rangers, and they reported that they had lost all trace of them. For the next two or three weeks Reuben did not return to his headquarters, spending the time in riding from station to station, with a small party of police, and urging upon the settlers the necessity not only of strongly barricading their houses, but of keeping a watch by turns; as the bush rangers seldom attack a place, unless they can gain the advantage of a surprise. As nothing had been heard of the bush rangers, Reuben determined to return to his barrack. He was spending the last night at Dick Caister\u0027s when, just as they were about to turn in, the sound of a horse\u0027s hoofs, at full gallop, was heard. \"Something is the matter,\" Dick said. \"Men don\u0027t ride like that, at night, for nothing.\" He went to the door and opened it, just as the horseman stopped in front. \"Quick, Caister!\" the man said as he leaped down, \"the bush rangers are not fifty yards behind.\" And indeed, the sound of the trampling of other horses sounded close behind. \"Come in, come in!\" Dick cried. \"Ah! Is it you, Shillito? Never mind the horse, he must look after himself. Luckily the captain\u0027s here, and we will give it them hot. Just run round and see that all the shutters are fastened.\" As Dick spoke he was barring the door, and he now shouted at the top of his voice to the two hired men, who were in bed upstairs; but before any answer could be returned, there was a thundering knocking at the door. \"What is it?\" Dick shouted. \"Open the door, and be quick about it, or it will be worse for you. We want that chap that\u0027s just ridden up, and we mean to have him, so he had best come out at once. If you don\u0027t open the door at once, we will cut the throats of every soul in the house.\" \"You have got to get at our throats first, my fine fellow,\" Dick said jeeringly. The knocking was at once renewed, but with greater violence. \"The door\u0027s a strong one,\" Dick said to Reuben, \"and it will stand a good deal of that sort of thing; but we may as well move the table and benches up against it, then we can see how things stand.\" Reuben had been busy taking down the guns, which hung over the fireplace; dropping a ramrod into them to see that they were charged, and putting fresh caps on to the nipples. His own rifle stood in the corner; and was, he knew, ready for service. \"What arms have you altogether, Caister?\" \"I have that rifle and double-barrel gun. Both my hands have got muskets; I got them up from Sydney, a few months back.\" The two men now came running down from above, each with his musket. \"Where is Jim?\" Reuben said, looking round. \"He went out about ten minutes ago,\" Dick said. \"I fancy he went to look after your horse. He takes as much care of that animal as if it were a child.\" \"I hope they won\u0027t find him in the stable, and cut his throat,\" Reuben said. \"He is wonderfully faithful and attached to me. I would not have harm come to him, for anything. \"Now, I will go upstairs and reconnoitre. Now those fellows have left off knocking at the door, they are a good deal more dangerous than when they were kicking up all the row.\" \"Mind how you show yourself, captain, as likely enough one of them is on the watch, expecting that we should be sure, sooner or later, to take a look out of that window. So keep well back. The night is pretty light, so I expect you will be able to make them out.\" \"Can we get a view of the stable from that window?\" \"Yes,\" Dick replied, \"I rather had that in my mind\u0027s eye, when I put the stable up. It\u0027s always a good thing, men knowing that their master can have an eye upon them, when they least expect it. Why do you ask?\" \"Because if the window commands the stable door, we can prevent them getting the horses out.\" \"Yes,\" Dick said, \"after losing two in that last affair, it would be a serious matter to have the rest of them carried off.\" Reuben went up the stairs and made his way towards the window, standing a short distance back. He could see no one moving about in the yard, and he was about to move close to it, when a tremendous crash took place below, followed by loud shouts. He ran downstairs again. The bush rangers had moved round to the back of the house and, there picking up a young tree which had been brought in, to saw up into billets for firewood, they used it as a battering ram against one of the shutters; and at the very first blow broke it off its hinges, and then made a rush at the window. Two shots rang out almost together; and then, firing a hasty volley into the window, the bush rangers began to climb in. But by this time Reuben had arrived, and the sharp cracks of his pistols rang out. \"They have got the police here!\" one of the men exclaimed, as he caught a sight of Reuben\u0027s uniform. \"Draw off, lads, I expect it\u0027s that accursed captain,\" another voice exclaimed. \"He\u0027s always riding about, with nobody but that black fellow with him. He has got to go down, that fellow has, or he will give us no end of trouble; but draw off from that window, for a moment.\" \"What will they do next, I wonder?\" Dick Caister said as, leaving the two hands to guard the window, he returned into the other room with Reuben. \"I rather expect they are going to try to burn us out. We must keep them from that, if we can. \"Mr. Shillito, will you go up to the upper room, and keep an eye on the stables? Shoot down anyone who may pass your line of sight. \"Haven\u0027t you got any loopholes, Caister?\" \"Yes, of course I have,\" Dick replied. \"I had forgotten all about them. Yes, there are two loopholes in the logs in each side of the house, upstairs. They have been shut up by wisps of straw, ever since the house was built.\" Giving strict orders, to the two men, to shout instantly if anyone moved near the window, the two young men went upstairs. \"Have you seen anything, Shillito?\" \"Not a thing. One would almost think that they have bolted.\" \"They will hardly do that, I fancy,\" Reuben said. \"There are ten or twelve of them, but I think one or two must have got a bullet in them.\" \"I wish they would come on,\" Dick said, as he pulled out the straw from the loopholes. Reuben went to them all in succession, and looked out, but nothing could be seen of their assailants. Presently, however, a number of dark figures appeared, each bearing a burden. \"They have been cutting brush wood!\" Reuben exclaimed. \"I was right, you see. They are going to try to smoke or burn us out. Now I think it\u0027s time to give them a lesson.\" \"Look, look!\" The exclamation was excited by a sudden glare of light, on the other side of the stables. \"The scoundrels have set fire to the stables!\" Shillito said. \"What shall we do—make a sally?\" Caister asked. \"I am ready for it, if you think right.\" \"No,\" Reuben said, \"they would only shoot us down as we come out. They must guess that some of us are up at this window, or they would try to carry the horses off, instead of destroying them. \"I only wish we were on the poor beasts\u0027 backs. We would go for them, though they were twice as many. \"I don\u0027t see the others now—they must have gone round to the other side of the house.\" Scarcely had Reuben taken up his station, at one of the loopholes behind, than he again saw the dark figures. He took steady aim and fired. There was a sharp cry, and one of the fellows fell to the ground. The others at once threw down their burdens, and fled. Three minutes later there was a shout. \"Look here, you policeman, and you, Caister, you shall pay dearly for this night\u0027s work. I swear it, and Bill Fothergill never forgets his word in that way. It\u0027s your turn, this time. It will be mine the next, and when it is, take care.\" The only reply was a shot from Reuben, aimed in the direction from which the voice came. A minute later there was a trampling of horses. \"They are gone!\" Shillito exclaimed. \"Perhaps it is only a trick, to draw us out,\" Dick suggested. \"No, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s that,\" Reuben said. \"They are not strong enough to send a party off, and to attack us with the rest. No, I think they have gone. They know that we can\u0027t follow them. \"They have taken good care of that,\" he added bitterly, as he glanced at the stables, which were now a sheet of flame. \"However, we will look round and see.\" The three men descended to the room below and, being joined by the two hands, removed the furniture piled against the door, and threw it open. \"We mustn\u0027t go round to that side of the house, so as to get into the glare of the fire, till we have looked round,\" Reuben said. \"I believe they are all gone; but they may have left a couple of them lurking, somewhere about, to pick us off when we show in the light. \"I will take one of your hands, Caister, and scout round on one side. Do you three go the other side.\" A quarter of an hour later the two parties met near the stables, where the fire was now burning low. The roof had fallen in, and only some of the uprights were erect, with flicking flames licking them as they stood glowing above the mass of still blazing debris. \"I wonder whether that poor fellow is under that?\" Reuben said. \"I hope not, indeed. I fancy he must have got away. He might have slipped off when they first rode up. He may be hiding somewhere round, afraid to come near till he knows how matters have turned out.\" So saying, he gave a loud cooey. They stood silent for a minute, but no answer came back. \"There is nothing to be done, till morning,\" Dick said, \"and it\u0027s no use hanging about here. Before it gets light I will start for Watson\u0027s. There are two of your men there; and they, with the two Watsons and ourselves, can set out after these fellows, if you are agreeable. That is, as soon as we get hold of some horses.\" \"I hardly think I shall be justified in taking you,\" Reuben said, as he walked back towards the house. \"These scoundrels are all armed to the teeth, and they are first-rate shots. They know every foot of the country, and against anything like equal numbers they would make a desperate fight of it, even if they did not thrash us. Of course, in anything like an equal number of my own men I should not hesitate, but I don\u0027t think it will be fair for you settlers to undertake such a service as that.\" \"Listen!\" Shillito exclaimed, \"they are coming back again.\" Surely enough, on the night air the sound of horses, galloping at full speed, could be heard. \"I don\u0027t think it can be them,\" Reuben said. \"They would have no motive in coming back, after they once rode off. They would know we should be ready for them.\" \"I don\u0027t see who else it can be. At any rate, all our guns are loaded; and if it is them, all the better.\" Suddenly a loud cooey was heard. \"That\u0027s Jim!\" Reuben exclaimed. \"I should know his call among a thousand. He must have made off to get help at once, but I don\u0027t know how he can have done it in time.\" \"Why, it\u0027s the Watsons and my men!\" he exclaimed, as the party rode up into the light. \"All safe?\" one of the settlers cried, as he jumped from his horse. \"All safe, thank God,\" Reuben replied. \"Did Jim bring you news that we were attacked?\" \"Yes; fortunately we were sitting up late, talking, when he rode up; so there was not a minute lost.\" \"Rode up!\" Reuben repeated, in surprise; \"why, where did you get a horse, Jim?\" \"Rode master\u0027s horse,\" Jim said. \"What!\" Reuben exclaimed in delight, \"what, is Tartar safe? I was afraid his body was under those ruins. Why, how did you get him out?\" \"Jim was in de stable, sah, when bush ranger ride up. De horses was stamping, and I not hear dem till dey come quite close, den it was too late to run out. \"De moment dat dey began to make bobbery at door, I opened stable door and bring out de three horses.\" \"What! Did you get mine out, too?\" Dick shouted. \"Jim, you are a trump, and no mistake.\" \"Den,\" Jim went on, paying no attention to the interruption, \"me led de other two hosses little way, and let them go loose, sure not go far from home; and I jump on Tartar, and ride like de debel to Watson\u0027s for de police.\" \"Well done, Jim. You have done capitally. Now let us talk over what we had better do.\" The party re-entered the house. Fresh wood was thrown on to the fire, and one of Dick\u0027s hands proceeded to put food on the table, and prepare tea, while the others consulted what course should be pursued. It was agreed, at once, that more aid would be necessary, before they could think of attacking the bush rangers; but all were ready to join in the hunt for them. Therefore it was decided that Dick Shillito and the two Watsons should each ride, at once, to neighbouring stations to bring aid. At one of the stations two more policemen would be found, and as in the pursuit they should probably pass near other stations, their numbers would swell as they went. When this was settled, the party sat down to the meal. \"How did you come upon them, Shillito?\" Caister asked. \"I had been spending the day with the Wilkinsons. I did not start to ride home till it was rather late, and I was riding fast when, about a quarter of a mile before I got to my place, I rode right into the middle of a lot of men on horseback. They evidently hadn\u0027t heard me coming, and were as much surprised as I was. \"There was a general shout of \u0027Bail up!\u0027 and I saw at once what sort of gentry they were. However, I didn\u0027t stop, but in the confusion dashed through. \"A few shots were fired at me. I suppose they were too surprised to aim straight. Then they started off after me. I knew it was no use making for home, for there was only one man there; so I swept round and made for your place. My horse is a good one, you know, and I gained on them all except one man, who must have been capitally mounted, for he gradually crept up to me. He wasn\u0027t twenty yards behind me when he shouted: \"\u0027Stop, or I fire!\u0027 \"I pulled straight up and, as he came up to me, let fly at him. He tumbled off his horse, and I galloped off till I got here.\" \"What has become of your horse, I wonder?\" \"I gave him a cut with my whip, as I jumped off. He cantered away. Of course they may have caught him, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s likely.\" \"You will find him somewhere about at daylight, I expect. I will ride Caister\u0027s spare horse, now.\" For Jim, with one of the hands, had gone out to fetch in the two horses from the spot where they had been turned loose. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3167/86896.html","bookId":867,"book":{"id":867,"title":"A Final Reckoning","description":"简介： In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers.
