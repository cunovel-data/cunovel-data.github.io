{"id":10029,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 15: At Donald\u0027s.","content":"It is difficult to say whether Kate Ellison, or Reuben Whitney was the most surprised at this unexpected meeting. The former, indeed, was aware that Reuben had come out to Australia; but that the boy, whose cause she had championed, should now stand before her as the officer, to whose energy and activity she and her sister owed so much, seemed almost incredible. But the surprise of Reuben was at least equal to that which she felt. He could scarcely credit the evidence of his senses, at seeing before him the young lady whom he had believed to be thousands of miles away, in England. As is usual in these cases, the girl was the first to recover from her surprise. \"And it is to you we owe so much!\" she said, holding out her hand. \"Mr. Barker spoke of our preserver as Captain Whitney; but somehow it never, for a moment, occurred to me to connect the name with you. \"Is it not extraordinary, Alice?\" she said, turning to her sister. \"The surprise to me is even greater than to you, Miss Ellison,\" Reuben said. \"Mr. Barker always spoke of Mrs. Donald and her sister, and I had not the least idea that you were in the colony. My mother wrote to me, a year ago, telling me of the changes which have taken place; but although she said that you had left Tipping, she said nothing about your coming out here.\" Reuben had, in fact, been much disturbed in his mind, a year previously, by hearing from his mother that Mr. Ellison had died suddenly. He had, it seemed, lost a large sum of money, from the failure of a bank in which he was a shareholder, and the blow had killed him. The estate was, when Mrs. Whitney wrote, for sale. Reuben had written back, begging his mother to send him all particulars that she could gather; but communication between Australia and England was in those days very slow, and no answer had yet been received. Another letter had, indeed, told him that the estate had been sold. Mrs. Ellison, he knew, had died a few weeks after he had left England. \"It is very simple,\" Kate Ellison said quietly; \"although of course it seems so strange to you, our being here. My sister was engaged to Mr. Donald before papa\u0027s death and, as you know, almost everything went owing to that bank; and as I had no reason for staying in England, I came out here with them.\" Reuben subsequently learned that Mr. Ellison had disapproved of the engagement of his daughter with Mr. Donald, who was the younger son of a neighbouring squire. When, after his death, Mr. Ellison\u0027s affairs were wound up, it was found that there remained only the six thousand pounds, which his wife had brought him, to be divided between her daughters. Mr. Donald possessed no capital, and had no prospects at home. He and Alice were quietly married, three months after her father\u0027s death, and had sailed a week later for New South Wales; where, as land could be taken up at a nominal price, it was thought that her little fortune would be ample to start them comfortably. All this, however, Reuben did not learn until some time later. After chatting for a short time, he returned to the camp fire. \"This is very awkward, Mr. Barker,\" Mrs. Donald said; \"do you know that Captain Whitney was, at one time, gardener\u0027s boy to our father?\" \"Oh, Alice!\" her sister exclaimed, \"what difference can that make?\" \"It seems to me,\" Mrs. Donald said, \"that it makes a very great difference. You know mamma never thought well of him, and it is very awkward, now, finding him here in such a position; especially as he has laid us under an obligation to him. \"Do you not think so, Mr. Barker?\" \"I do not pretend to know anything about such matters, Mrs. Donald,\" Mr. Barker said bluntly; \"and I shouldn\u0027t have thought it could have made any difference to you, what the man was who had saved you from such a fate as would have befallen you, had it not been for his energy. I can only say that Captain Whitney is a gentleman with whom anyone here, or in the old country, would be glad to associate. I may say that when he came here, three or four months ago, my friend Mr. Hudson—one of the leading men in the colony—wrote to me, saying that Captain Whitney was one of his most intimate friends, that he was in every respect a good fellow, and that he himself was under a lifelong obligation to him; for he had, at the risk of his life, when on the way out, saved that of his daughter when she was attacked by a mad Malay at the Cape. \"More than that, I did not inquire. It was nothing to me whether he was born a prince, or a peasant.\" Mrs. Donald coloured hotly, at the implied reproof of Mr. Barker\u0027s words. She had always shared her mother\u0027s prejudices against Reuben Whitney, and she had not been long enough, in the colony, to become accustomed to the changes of position which are there so frequent. \"You do not understand, Mr. Barker,\" she said pettishly. \"It was not only that he was a boy employed in the family. There were other circumstances—\" \"Oh, Alice!\" Kate broke out, \"how can you speak of such things? Here are we at present, owing more than our lives to this man, and you are going now to damage him by raking up that miserable old story. \"Mr. Barker,\" she said impulsively, \"my father, one of the most just, as well as one of the most kind of men, had the highest opinion of Reuben Whitney; believe me, there was nothing in the circumstances to which Alice alludes which could cast the slightest slur upon his character.\" \"I feel certain of that, my dear young lady,\" Mr. Barker said, \"even without your assurance. Your sister is shaken by the events of the day, and no wonder; and I am quite sure that when she thinks this matter over she will see that, whatever her preconceived ideas may be, it would be most ungrateful and ungenerous to breathe a single word in disparagement of Captain Whitney.\" So saying, he turned on his heel and left the room; and Kate, wishing to avoid further words on the matter with her sister, followed his example. Mrs. Donald\u0027s reflections were not pleasant. She felt that Mr. Barker\u0027s reproof was well deserved, and that she had acted ungratefully and ungenerously. As a rule, Mr. Ellison\u0027s elder daughter was by no means of an unkind disposition; but she was essentially her mother\u0027s child. The question of Reuben Whitney had been one which had caused more serious dissension, between her father and mother, than any she ever remembered. She had taken her mother\u0027s view of the case, while Kate had agreed with her father; and although the subject had been dropped, by mutual consent, it had been a very sore one; and at the sight of Reuben, the remembrance of the old unpleasantness had caused her to play a part which she could not but feel was mean and unworthy. She felt angry at herself—angry with Mr. Barker, with her sister, and with Reuben. She was standing there, with her lips pressed together as she thought over the matter, when Mrs. Barker came into the room. \"He is awake now, my dear. Perhaps you had better go in to him.\" Then she dismissed from her mind the events of the last few minutes, and went in to take her place by the side of her husband. But as, during the long hours of the night, she sat there and thought over what had passed since the preceding evening, the thought of how much she owed to Reuben Whitney was uppermost in her mind; and when in the morning Mrs. Barker relieved her, she went into the other room, where Mr. Barker and Kate were about to sit down to breakfast, and said: \"Mr. Barker, I thank you for what you said to me last night. You were right and I was wrong. I was ungrateful, and ungenerous. I can only say that it was a very sore subject, and that in my surprise I thought of the past, and not the present. Believe me, I am very sorry for what I said.\" \"That is quite enough, Mrs. Donald,\" Mr. Barker said heartily. \"I am very glad you have said what you have. I was sure that you would, upon reflection, feel that whatever the old grievance might have been, it could not weigh an instant against what you owe to that young fellow now. Let us say no more on the subject. You were shaken and not yourself, and I was wrong in taking you up so sharply, under the circumstances.\" Kate said nothing, but her face showed that she was greatly pleased at her sister\u0027s change of tone. \"What is going to be done, Mr. Barker?\" Mrs. Donald asked. \"Of course, the friends who came to our rescue cannot stay here; and there is no chance of my husband being moved, for a long time.\" \"I am afraid not, indeed,\" Mr. Barker said. \"Most of them will leave this afternoon, in time to get back to their stations tonight. \"I have been speaking with Captain Whitney, and he says that he with his men will certainly stay here, for the present.. He sent off a messenger, last night, for six more of his men to join him here; for he still hopes to get news from his native boy, which may set him on the tracks of the bush rangers. You need, however, be under no alarm; for I think there is no chance, whatever, of the bush rangers returning. \"By the way, Whitney would like to speak to you, after breakfast. He wants you to give him as minute a description as you can of the fellows you saw. We have already descriptions of four or five of them, given by men whom they have stuck up; but the band must have increased lately, and any particulars might be useful.\" Reuben came round in a quarter of an hour later. Mr. Barker fetched him into the room where Mrs. Barker and Kate were sitting. \"Mr. Donald is no worse, I am glad to hear,\" he said, as he shook hands with the two ladies. \"I see no change whatever,\" Mrs. Barker said. \"He is conscious, but does not speak much. He asked me, this morning, to tell you and all your friends how deeply he feels indebted to you.\" \"His thanks are due to the settlers, rather than to me, Mrs. Barker. They were volunteers, you know, while I was simply on duty. We had, however, one common interest—to get here in time to save the station and, above all, to catch and break up this gang of scoundrels. \"And now, Miss Ellison, if you feel equal to it, would you kindly give us an account of what happened? Mr. Barker said that he would not ask you, yesterday; but something, perhaps, let drop by chance, might serve as an indication to us as to the direction in which these fellows have gone.\" \"I will tell you, certainly,\" the girl said, her face paling a little; \"although it is dreadful, even now, to think of. We of course had no idea of attack, and had gone to bed as usual. One of the men was always on guard, on the outside of the house; for these attacks made Mr. Donald nervous for the safety of my sister, and myself. Simpson was on guard that night. Whether he went to sleep or not, I cannot say.\" \"He did, Miss Ellison,\" Reuben interrupted. \"We found his body round by the end of the house. He had evidently been sitting down on a log, against the house; and had been killed by a crushing blow with some heavy instrument, probably one of the tools they used for breaking in.\" \"The first we knew about it,\" Kate went on, \"was a tremendous crash downstairs, which was followed by a continuous thundering noise. I think they must have burst the door in with crowbars, or something—that was the first noise we heard—but a strong wooden bar, inside, kept the door in its place till they battered it down with a log. \"I hurried on some things. Just as I had done—it was not a minute, I think, from the time I woke—Alice ran in, partly dressed, too. I had heard Mr. Donald shout to the men, then there was another great crash as the bar gave way, and then some shots were fired. \"Mr. Donald had been standing just behind the door, and had fired through it the moment before it gave way. He had not time to step back, and was knocked down by the door. It was fortunate for him, for the bush rangers rushed in and shot down the two men, instantly. \"Alice would have run down to see what had happened to her husband, but I would not let her out of my room. She could have done no good, and might have been shot. Then we heard them moving about the house, swearing and using all sorts of horrible language. Then they shouted up to us to come down, or else they would come and fetch us; so we opened the door, and came down at once. \"Alice gave a little cry of joy, as she entered the room and saw her husband standing unhurt, though still looking dazed and confused from his blow. \"The leader of the band—I suppose you have not seen him, Captain Whitney?\" \"No, indeed,\" Reuben said. \"I would give a good deal to catch sight of him.\" \"What do you know about him?\" \"I only know that he is a young fellow, not much older than I am myself. His was a life sentence. He was concerned in a burglary in the country, in which two old ladies were killed. Two of his accomplices were hung for it, but in consideration of his youth, and as it was not proved that he took an absolute part in the murder, he got off with a life sentence. I heard about the case from Captain Wilson. \"He came out here about a year after I did. He had not been here a month when he killed one of the guard, and made his escape. Since that time he has been a scourge to the colony. Not a week has passed without complaints of his bailing up and robbing teamsters on their way down to Sydney. He soon gathered two or three others about him, and his daring and impudence soon made him a noted character. Several times he, with two other men, rode into good-sized villages and, pistol in hand, went from house to house, and carried off every shilling in the place. He has ridden into large stores single handed, and compelled the storekeepers to hand over the contents of their tills. Sometimes they bring spare horses with them, and ride off laden with groceries and stores. He has committed at least a score of murders, always using his pistol at the slightest show of opposition; and sometimes murdering, apparently, from pure love of the thing.\" \"Do you know his name?\" Kate asked. \"His real name? No, I don\u0027t know that I ever heard it. He is always spoken of as Fothergill.\" \"I will tell you his real name, presently,\" Kate said. \"As my sister and I came into the kitchen, he took off his hat and made a deep bow and said: \"\u0027Ladies, me and my mates are sorry to put you to any inconvenience; but as we happen to be hungry, we must trouble you to get us some supper. You need not bother to make tea, wine is good enough for us.\u0027 \"Of course, as we were in their hands there was nothing to do but to obey his orders; so we spread the cloth, and brought out what there was in the larder. Then we fetched in the wine, and I brought several bottles of spirits; for, as I whispered to Alice, \u0027If they get drunk, we may be able to get away from them.\u0027 \"Before they sat down, the captain told two of his men to go upstairs with us and fetch down our watches and jewelry, and the money there was in the house. Mr. Donald had already told them where they would find that. \"We lit four candles, and put them on the table. The captain ordered Mr. Donald to sit down facing him, saying with a sort of mock politeness that they should not really enjoy their food, unless their host took the head of the table. Several times, while they were eating, I saw the captain looking hard at Alice and me. Presently he said: \"\u0027I have it now. Why, you are the Ellison girls, ain\u0027t you?\u0027 \"I was astonished, as you may suppose, but I said: \"\u0027I am Miss Ellison, and Mrs. Donald is my sister.\u0027 \"\u0027By Jove, who would have thought it!\u0027 he said. \u0027Do you know who I am?\u0027 \"I said I didn\u0027t, although really I seemed to have some sort of recollection of his face. \"\u0027Why,\u0027 he said, \u0027don\u0027t you remember Tom Thorne, whose father the squire turned out of the public house? And to think, now, that the squire\u0027s daughters are waiting on me. This is a piece of luck. \"\u0027Well, my dears,\u0027 he went on, with a horrible grin, \u0027you need not tell me how you came here now, you will have plenty of time for that. We have made up our minds to take you both with us, for it\u0027s a horrible lonely life in the bush, without the pleasure of ladies\u0027 society. But I never dreamt that I was in for such a slice of luck as this.\u0027 \"Mr. Donald jumped from his seat as the fellow spoke, but in a moment he levelled a pistol at him and shouted: \"\u0027Sit down or I fire.\u0027 \"Alice rushed to her husband, and pushed him down into his seat. \"\u0027I had rather die than go with you,\u0027 I said to him quietly. \"\u0027Perhaps so, my dear,\u0027 he replied; \u0027but you see, you haven\u0027t got the choice.\u0027 \"Then he went on taunting us about old times, and especially reminding me that I had got him a thrashing, over breaking the school house window. When I went out to get them some more wine, for they wouldn\u0027t touch the spirits, I got a knife and hid it in my dress; for I made up my mind to kill myself, rather than that. \"A little later I stole upstairs and brought down a brace of pistols, which Mr. Donald kept under his pillow, and slipped one into Alice\u0027s hand. Presently they began to get noisy, and the captain ordered me to come and sit on his knee. Then Alice and I showed the pistols, and said we would shoot ourselves, if one of them laid a finger on us. \"The captain muttered some order to his men, which I didn\u0027t hear; but I guessed it was to leave us alone, for the present. I had no doubt what they intended to do was to catch us off our guard, and wrench the pistols from us; and I was glad I had the knife hidden away, for if they did carry us off, I was sure to be able to find some opportunity for using that. \"It was awful!\" the girl said, putting her hand to her face. \"Awful to be standing there and hearing them laughing and shouting and cursing. I was tempted to go behind him, and shoot him suddenly; but the others would have been just as bad, and we should have gained nothing by it. I would not go through that half hour again, for all the money in the world. \"The men had just finished and were getting up from the table, and I knew the moment was coming fast, when we heard a sudden shout outside. My heart gave a bound, as they rushed to the door. The captain fired a shot at Mr. Donald, just as he was getting up; and as he ran out, shouted to me: \"\u0027I will come back for you, missy.\u0027 \"If it had not been for Mr. Donald falling to the ground, I should have fainted; but Alice called me as she ran to him, and I think I was trying to lift him up when the constable ran in, and I knew we were saved.\" Reuben had given a sudden start, when Kate Ellison mentioned the name of Tom Thorne, but he had not interrupted her. \"I had a score against that scoundrel before,\" he said, as she finished; \"and by heavens, I will settle accounts with him when I meet him. I could have forgiven him for the wrongs he did me; but now—\" and his fingers closed on the hilt of the pistol in his belt. Kate, who had been looking down as she told her story, raised her eyes at the tone of intense passion in the young officer\u0027s words; and a sudden flush of colour mounted into her cheeks, which were pale from the terror and excitement through which she had gone. \"I say ditto to Captain Whitney,\" Mr. Barker said. \"I don\u0027t know anything about his previous doings against him; but I know that, if ever I come across the scoundrel, I will shoot him as a dog. \"Even you can\u0027t say anything against that, wife, though you are always on the side of mercy.\" \"No,\" Mrs. Barker agreed. \"I would say nothing to stay your hand there, John. Even putting this aside, he has committed a score of murders; and there will be no more wrong, in shooting him, than there would be in killing a wild beast. \"That is the sound of a horse coming, at a gallop. Perhaps it is the doctor.\" Hurrying to the door they found, to their great satisfaction, that Mrs. Barker\u0027s guess was verified. The surgeon had been at home when the messenger arrived, and had started five minutes later, arriving three or four hours earlier than they had even ventured to hope. Mrs. Barker at once led the way into the next room and, a few minutes later, came out again for hot water and sponges. Kate had stolen away upstairs, when the surgeon had entered the house. The two men remained to hear the verdict. \"He is going to probe the wound. He can give no opinion, yet, till he discovers what course it has taken; but he says that it is a favourable symptom that the pulse is so strong and regular. He wishes you both to come in, as it will be necessary to hold his patient\u0027s hands, while he is making the examination.\" \"I cannot give any positive opinion,\" the surgeon said, when he had finished the examination. \"I can\u0027t find the ball, and I cannot tell for certain what course it took, after entering; but I think, judging from the pulse, and I may say from the expression of his face, that no vital part is injured.\" An exclamation of thankfulness broke from Mrs. Donald. \"We must not be too sanguine,\" Mr. Ruskin went on; \"but there is certainly strong ground for hope. I shall be able to give a more definite opinion, in the course of a few hours. He must, of course, be kept perfectly quiet; with no more nourishment than is absolutely necessary, and that in the shape of beef tea. I should make him a bed here. We will manage to slide a door under him, and lift him on to it, with as little movement as possible. \"At any rate, madam,\" he said, turning to Mrs. Donald, \"I can congratulate you upon the fact that the bullet did not strike a couple of inches higher. Had it done so, my ride would have been a useless one.\" A bed was at once brought from a room above and made up, and Mr. Donald was placed upon it, in the manner which Mr. Ruskin had suggested. Then with lightened hearts the party, with the exception of his wife, left the room. Kate and Mrs. Barker at once set to to prepare a meal for the surgeon; while Reuben went over to give his companions the good news, that the surgeon had strong hopes that Mr. Donald would recover. In the afternoon all the party, with the exception of Mr. and Mrs. Barker and the constables, rode off to their respective stations; assuring Reuben of their readiness to assemble again, at once, should he obtain news which would afford a hope that the gang could be traced. A few hours later, the other four constables for whom Reuben had sent rode up. An outhouse was now prepared for the reception of the police, Reuben himself taking up his abode there, although Mrs. Donald strongly urged him to come into the house; but with Mr. and Mrs. Barker and the surgeon there, and the time of one of the ladies taken up with the wounded man, Reuben thought that their hands were perfectly full, and said that he should prefer to mess and sleep with his men. \"You see, Mrs. Donald,\" he said, as she tried to induce him to alter his determination, \"I shall have to be sending out men and receiving reports, and may be obliged to ride out in the middle of the night; therefore, you see, as absolute quiet is ordered for your husband, it will be far better for me to be outside the house; as the coming and going would be sure to disturb him, and he would naturally want to know what is going on.\" \"You will not, I hope, take all your party away in pursuit of these men, Captain Whitney,\" she said anxiously. \"They might get up some false alarm, to take you away, and then come down upon the house again. I have been too much taken up with my husband to think much about it; but although Kate keeps up bravely, I know that she is greatly shaken, and terribly anxious. I don\u0027t know whether she told you; but it was to her, chiefly, that horrible man spoke; and it was she he told, as he rushed out, that he would come back to fetch her. She will never have a moment\u0027s peace, or tranquillity, till we hear that he is either killed or taken.\" \"Nor shall I,\" Reuben said. \"I do not think that the scoundrel will dare to attempt to carry out his threat to come back again; but with so daring a villain, it would be rash to omit the smallest precaution. You may be quite sure, Mrs. Donald, that in no case will I leave the house unprotected; and that if I should be called away I will leave two men here who, during my absence, will remain in the house; and with them, Mr. Barker, and the doctor, you may feel perfectly assured that no open attack will be made. \"But I cannot impress too strongly upon you that, seeing the man with whom we have to deal, your sister should not stir outside the house; until we have caught him, or until Mr. Donald is so far recovered as to be able to be removed. I will not tell her so myself; because I see that, now the strain is over, she is greatly shaken, and I would not add to her anxiety; but if you could break it to her, as if it were your own idea, that she had better keep within doors until this fellow\u0027s caught, I am sure that it will be well.\" \"You will come in this evening, I hope; and always of an evening, Captain Whitney. It will make a change, and cheer us up; besides, we want to hear all about your adventures, since we saw you last.\" This Reuben gladly promised and, after it was dark, and he had placed a sentry, he came into the house. Mrs. Barker was on duty in the sick room; and Reuben, at Mrs. Donald\u0027s request, gave them an account of the voyage out, and of the circumstances which had led to his entering the police. He would have passed very briefly over the affair at the Cape, but by many questions Mrs. Donald succeeded in eliciting from him all the details of the story. \"It was a gallant action, indeed,\" she said warmly. \"You certainly saved the lives of those two girls, at a terrible risk of your own.\" \"To make the romance complete, Whitney,\" Mr. Barker remarked, \"you ought to have married Miss Hudson.\" \"Unfortunately, you see,\" Reuben said with a smile, \"in the first place I was only a boy, and she was two years my senior; in the next, and much more important place, she happened to be in love with someone else; and I did not happen to be in love with her, though she was, I admit, a very charming young lady, and had been extremely kind to me.\" \"How was that, Whitney?\" Mr. Barker asked. \"Eighteen is a susceptible age. I can only account for your coldness on the supposition that you had left your heart in England.\" \"I fancy my heart was, then, where it is now,\" Reuben rejoined, with a slight smile. \"In the right place, eh, Whitney?\" \"In the right place,\" Reuben repeated quietly. At this moment Mrs. Barker entered, and said that Mr. Donald would be glad if Reuben would come and sit with him, for a little time. \"Don\u0027t let him talk much,\" Mr. Ruskin said. \"The less he talks, the better; but your talking to him, for a time, will cheer him up and do him good.\" \"I am glad to see you going on so well, Mr. Donald,\" Reuben said heartily, as he entered. \"The doctor says you are not to talk much; but you are to play the part of a listener.\" \"Do you think you will catch these fellows?\" was Mr. Donald\u0027s first question. \"I will catch them, sooner or later,\" Reuben said. \"I will run them down if they are above ground; but I can take no steps in the matter until I hear from my black boy. I have been expecting him to turn up, ever since I got here; and shall begin to be afraid that those scoundrels have ill treated him, if he does not turn up before long.\" \"My wife has been telling me that they knew you at home, Whitney; and that she and her people did you some terrible injustice, somehow. But she wouldn\u0027t go into the matter. Curious, isn\u0027t it, your meeting at this end of the world; and that, too, at such a moment?\" \"It is curious,\" Reuben said; \"what people call a coincidence. But Mrs. Donald is mistaken in telling you that her people did me an injustice. Her father was one of the kindest friends I ever had, and although Mrs. Ellison somewhat misjudged me, and her daughter naturally shared her feeling, they were not in anyway to be blamed for that; for they only thought as ninety-nine people out of a hundred did.\" \"Whitney, Whitney,\" Mr. Donald muttered to himself. \"I seemed to know the name, though I cannot recall where. \"Ah!\" he said suddenly, \"of course I remember now, for I was in the court when—\" and he stopped. \"When I was tried,\" Reuben put in quietly. \"Yes, that was me. I was acquitted, as you know, principally from the way in which Mr. Ellison stood up for me. Thank God that he never, for an instant, believed that I was guilty.\" \"And to think it should be you!\" Mr. Donald said. \"How strange things turn out! I remember I could not make up my mind about it. It seemed so strange, either way.\" \"We had better not talk about it now,\" Reuben said quietly. \"I said then, and I say now, that I knew the people who did it and, strange as the circumstances have already been, you may think them stranger still, some day, if I bring one of them before you, alive or dead.\" At this moment there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Donald came in and said that one of the constabulary wished to speak to Reuben. \"Then I will say goodnight. I hope I shall find you getting on nicely, in the morning, Mr. Donald. \"Will you say goodnight to Miss Ellison and Mrs. Barker for me, Mrs. Donald? And tell Mr. Barker that I shall be ready, in five minutes, to smoke that pipe we talked about with him, outside.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3167/86898.html","bookId":867,"book":{"id":867,"title":"A Final Reckoning","description":"简介： In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers.
