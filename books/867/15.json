{"id":10028,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 14: An Unexpected Meeting.","content":"As soon as it was light the party were assembled and started, Jim leading the way, at a swinging pace which kept the horses going at a hand canter. The marks were, for a time, perfectly easy to follow. Five miles on the tracks led to a shepherd\u0027s hut. At their call, the man came out. \"You had a visit from bush rangers last night?\" \"What if I did?\" the man replied gruffly. \"I can\u0027t help where the bush rangers pay their visits. Yes, they came in here and said they wanted some supper; and you may guess I did not keep them waiting long, for they were not in a particularly good temper. From what they said, three of their men had been killed.\" This was already known to the party, as Jim had found three bodies at a short distance from the house. Two of these had evidently been carried there from the back window, where they had been killed in trying to effect the entry. The other had been shot when approaching to fire the house. \"The captain of the gang was terrible put out, and was a-cussing and swearing as to what he would do to those as did it. I wouldn\u0027t be in their shoes, if they were to fall into his hands.\" \"They didn\u0027t say anything which would give you an idea as to the direction they were taking?\" \"Not they,\" the man replied. \"You don\u0027t suppose they would be such fools as that and, if they had, you don\u0027t suppose as I should be such a fool to split on \u0027em. Not likely. I ain\u0027t no desire to wake up, one night, and find the door fastened outside and the thatch on fire.\" \"We may as well ride on,\" Reuben said. \"We shall learn nothing here. The fellow is a ticket-of-leave man, and as likely as not in league with these scoundrels. \"I wonder what they came here for,\" he added, as they started again. \"I tell you, sah,\" Jim said. \"Dat fellow has driven his herd ober their trail—all stamped out—no saying where they hab gone to.\" \"We must follow the herd, then,\" Reuben said. \"If we look sharp, we ought to be able to see the traces where they left them.\" Jim shook his head. \"No find,\" he said decidedly. \"Plenty places where de ground am berry hard, and horse feet no show. Dey choose some place like dat and turn off; perhaps put rug under horses\u0027 feet, so as to make no mark. Me sarch, sah. Jim look him eyes very hard, but tink no find.\" And so, to their great disappointment, it turned out. They followed the tracks of the herd three miles, until they came upon them, quietly grazing; but nowhere could they see any trace of a party of horsemen turning off. All the party were greatly vexed at the ill success of their expedition; for all had hoped that they were, at last, going to overtake the gang who had done such mischief in the colony. Reuben was especially disgusted. He had, only the day before, received a letter from his chief acknowledging the receipt of his report describing the pursuit of the blacks, and congratulating him warmly upon his success. The letter ended: \"If you can but give as good an account of the bush rangers, we shall be indeed grateful to you. As it is, you have more than justified my selection of you for the post.\" Leaving two constables as guards, at Dick Caister\u0027s station, in case, as was probable enough, the bush rangers should return to take revenge for the repulse they had experienced there, Reuben rode back to his headquarters, from which he had now been absent some time. The evening after his return, he called Jim into his room. \"Jim,\" he said, \"I want your advice as to the best way of finding out where these bush rangers are quartered. How do you think we had better set about it? Would it be of any use, do you think, for you to go among the natives and try and find out? There is no doubt they know, for they have often acted with the bush rangers. Do you think you could pass among them?\" \"No, sah,\" Jim said at once. \"Me no speak deir way. Me understand black fellow, me talk dar language, but not same way. They find out difference directly and kill me. De wild black fellows hate those who hab lived wid de white men. We hate dem just de same way. We say dem bad black fellow, dey say we no good.\" \"But those rascally trackers who led us wrong, that day of the fight, they were friendly with them.\" \"Yes, sah, but dey not so very long away from the bush, and always keep friends wid the others. Meet dem and talk to dem, and tell dem dey set the white men on wrong tracks.\" \"Well, Jim, but could not you do the same?\" \"No good, sah. Me brought up among de whites, eber since me little boy. Dey not believe me if I go and say dat to dem. Jim ready to get killed, if de captain want him; but no good at all him getting killed in dat way.\" \"I don\u0027t want you to get killed in any way, Jim, and if that\u0027s your opinion about it, we will give up the plan at once. Can you think of any other way?\" \"Me tink a lot about him. Me know de captain want very much to catch dose fellows, but Jim no see how dat can be done, for sure. But de best plan me can see is for Jim to go out by himself, and search de country outside white man\u0027s bounds. If he find de track of horses, he follow dem up. Me know about de way dey ride off after dey be killing people at de stations. If Jim look, and look, and look berry sharp he find dar track for sure; and once he find dem, he follow dem up. Must be water, for sure, where dey live. Dat good guide to begin with. \"But captain must not hurry; Jim may be long time before he find dem, dar no saying how long. Captain wish Jim to go?\" \"Well, Jim, I don\u0027t want you to go; that is to say, I should miss you very much; but if you could find out the haunts of these scoundrels, you would be doing me a very great service, as well as the people of all the stations.\" \"Jim no care about oder people,\" the black said. \"He care for de captain, and will go out and try and find tracks.\" \"Be careful, Jim, and don\u0027t get into trouble with them. If you were to fall into their hands, and they were to find out you were connected with the police, they would shoot you like a dog.\" \"Dey won\u0027t find out. White man not understand. Black fellow all one to him. You hab no fear for Jim. Who look after hoss, while Jim away?\" \"I shall appoint one of the policemen as my orderly, Jim, and he will look after him.\" Jim made a contemptuous gesture, to signify that he had little confidence in the power of any white man to look after Tartar. For the rest of the evening Jim was occupied in cooking, and in the morning he was gone. A week later, Reuben was among the outlying stations again. He had heard nothing of the bush rangers, and no fresh attacks had been made by them, since that upon Dick Caister\u0027s station. One evening, just as he had gone up to bed, he was roused by a sharp knocking at the door of the house in which he was stopping. The settlers had grown cautious now, and an upper window was opened, and Reuben heard the questions, \"Who is there?\" and \"What is it?\" \"Is Captain Whitney here?\" \"Yes, do you want him?\" \"Yes, I want to see him directly.\" In a minute, Reuben had opened the door. \"I am Captain Whitney,\" he said. \"What is it?\" \"I am glad I have found you, sir. They told me at the next station you were here yesterday, but they did not know whether you were here now. \"Well, sir, I am shepherding some twenty miles away; and this afternoon, just as I had got back to my hut, in runs a black fellow. It is a lonely spot, and I reached for my gun, thinking there was more of them, when he said: \"\u0027No shoot, me friend. Me sarve Captain Whitney of de police. You know him?\u0027 \"I said I had heard your name. \"\u0027You know where he is?\u0027 the black asked. \"I said I did not know for certain; but that when my mate went in for grub, two days before, he had heard say that you had been along there that morning. \"The black said: \u0027Good. You run and find him.\u0027 \"\u0027Thank you,\u0027 says I. \u0027What for?\u0027 \"\u0027I find out about the bush rangers,\u0027 he said. \u0027You go and tell captain dat, tomorrow morning before de day begins, dey attack the station of Donald\u0027s.\u0027 \"\u0027Are you quite sure?\u0027 says I. \"\u0027Quite sure,\u0027 says the black. \u0027Me heard dem say so.\u0027 \"So as I hates the bush rangers like poison, I saddles up and rides into the station; and when I had told the boss, he said I better ride and find you, if I could. You would be at one of the stations this way. I stopped at three of them, and at the last they told me you was here.\" \"Thank you greatly, my good fellow. Donald\u0027s! I don\u0027t know the name. Where do they live?\" \"They have only been here a couple of months,\" Reuben\u0027s host, who was standing beside him, replied. \"They bought that station of Anderson\u0027s. He was a chicken-hearted young fellow, and sold out because of the bush rangers. There is a man, his wife, and her sister, I believe. I fancy they have got a pretty fair capital. They took Anderson\u0027s stock, and have been buying a lot more. That\u0027s why the bush rangers are going to attack them.\" \"I thought,\" Reuben said, \"that Anderson\u0027s was not one of the most exposed stations.\" \"No, that was what everyone told him, before he sold it.\" \"How far would you say it was from here?\" \"Thirty-five miles,\" the settler said. \"It\u0027s ten miles from Barker\u0027s, and I reckon that\u0027s twenty-five from here.\" \"Well, of course I shall ride at once; as there are women there, it makes the case all the more urgent. I have got my orderly, and there are two more men at the station, this side of Barker\u0027s.\" \"I will go, of course,\" Reuben\u0027s host said, \"and will bring two men with me. \"You had best stop here for the night,\" he added, turning to the shepherd. \"You have ridden pretty well thirty miles already, and that at the end of your day\u0027s work.\" \"Not I,\" the man replied. \"Jim Walsh is not going to be lying in bed, with the thought of two women in the hands of them murderous bush rangers. You might lend me a fresh horse, if you have got one. If not, I must try and pick one up at one of the stations, as we go along.\" \"I have plenty of horses in the yard,\" the settler said. \"Well, let us be off as soon as possible,\" Reuben put in. \"It\u0027s past twelve o\u0027clock now, and we have thirty-five miles to ride, and to stop at two or three places, so we haven\u0027t a minute to lose.\" In a few minutes the horses were saddled, and the six men dashed off at full gallop. At three stations, which they passed on the way to Barker\u0027s, they picked up seven more. There was but little delay as, the instant the news was told, the men hurried up, saddled their horses, and rode after the party, who pushed straight on when they had told their story. At Barker\u0027s they were joined by Barker himself, and two men. Two constables had also been picked up on the way. The others overtook them here, and the party now numbered twenty men. There was a pause to allow all to come up, and to give the horses breathing time, for they had traversed twenty-five miles at a rapid pace, with scarce a halt. Mrs. Barker herself prepared a meal, to which, while the horses got their breath, their riders did justice. Then they mounted again, and rode for Donald\u0027s. \"It all depends,\" Reuben said, \"as to our being there in time, whether the man keeps a careful watch. If he does they may not attack till the doors are opened, and then make a sudden rush and catch them unawares. If, when they arrive there, they find the whole house is asleep, they may burst in at once.\" \"I think they will be careful,\" Mr. Barker said. \"I know Donald is very anxious; and no wonder, with two women with him, both young and pretty—quite out of the way, indeed. In fact, he told me the first day I rode over, he had no idea of the unsettled state of the district, and wouldn\u0027t have taken the place if he had, not even if Anderson had given it as a gift; and he wrote down at once to some agent, and told him to sell the place again, for whatever he can get for it; but I expect there will be some trouble in finding a purchaser. The district here has had a bad name for some time and, if Donald had not arrived fresh from England, he must have heard of it. \"Listen! I thought I heard the sound of firing.\" There was a momentary pause, but no one could hear anything. Nevertheless, they went on at redoubled speed. They were now within three miles of the station. Suddenly, on coming over a crest, a faint light was seen ahead. It increased rapidly, and a tongue of flame leapt up. \"Come on, lads!\" Reuben exclaimed. \"The scoundrels are at their work.\" At a hard gallop they crossed the intervening ground, until they were within half a mile of the station, from which a broad sheet of flame was leaping up. Then Reuben drew rein, for he had outridden the rest of his party, and it was important that all should ride together. \"Now,\" he said, when they were gathered; \"let us keep in a close body. \"If they ride off as we arrive there, do you, Jones and Wilkins, stop at the station and see if you can render any help. If not, follow us at once. \"Let the rest keep on with me, straight after the bush rangers. There is already a faint light in the east. In half an hour it will be broad day so, even if they have got a start, we shall be able to follow them. Now, come on.\" At the head of his party, Reuben rode at full speed down to the station. As he neared it he saw, to his satisfaction, that the flames arose from some of the outbuildings, and that the house itself was still intact; but as no firing had been heard, he hoped that it still resisted. There was a shrill whistle, when the party approached within a hundred yards. Men were seen to dash out of the house, and to leap upon their horses. With a shout, Reuben rode down. He did not pause for a moment, but dashed past the house in the direction in which the bush rangers had fled. They were, he knew, but a hundred yards ahead; but it was not light enough for him to see them, especially after riding through the glare of the fire. The sound of the horses\u0027 feet, however, afforded an indication; but as there was no saying in which direction they might turn, he was forced to halt, every two or three minutes, to listen. To his mortification he found that, each time, the sound was getting more indistinct; for the speed at which they had travelled had taken so much out of the horses, that they were unable to compete with the fresher animals ridden by the bush rangers, who were all well mounted, many of the best horses in the district having been stolen by them. At last the sound could be heard no longer, and Reuben was reluctantly obliged to give the order to halt; for he feared he might override the trail. \"It is no use,\" he said, as he reined in his horse. \"They will know as well as we do that they are out of hearing now, and might turn off anywhere. It is terribly annoying. We are too late to save the station, and the bush rangers have escaped. \"However, we will take up their trail as soon as it is daylight. Indeed, I am expecting every moment to be joined by Jim, who is sure to be somewhere near, and can perhaps guide us direct to their hiding place.\" Deeply disappointed, the party dismounted from their horses. \"The scoundrels must have had someone on the watch,\" Reuben said, \"or they would never have taken the alarm so soon. I am sorry, now, that we did not send a party round to the other side before we charged down upon them; but my blood was on fire at the sight of the burning station, and at the thought of the women in the hands of those scoundrels.\" A minute later, a man rode up at full speed from behind. \"Is that you, Jones?\" Reuben said, stepping forward. \"Yes, sir,\" the man replied, reining in his horse. \"I left Wilkins behind, and rode on to tell you what had happened.\" \"What has happened, Jones?\" \"It\u0027s a bad business, sir, a shocking bad business; but it might have been worse. It seems they broke in about half an hour before we got there. One of the hands was supposed to be on watch in the stockyard; but either he was asleep, or they crept up to him and killed him before he could give the alarm. Then they got up to the house and burst in the door, before the others were fairly awake. \"They shot the two hands at once; but I suppose, as their blood wasn\u0027t up, and no resistance was offered, they thought they had plenty of time for fooling; for they must have reckoned that no force they need be afraid of could be got together, for three or four hours. So they made Donald and his wife and sister get breakfast for them. The women, it seemed had got pistols, and both swore they would blow out their brains if any man laid a hand on them. However, the bush rangers did not touch them, though they told them they would have to go off with them. \"They made Donald sit down at one end of the table, while their captain took the other; and the two women, half dressed as they were, waited on them. It was lucky for them that we were so close when the alarm was given, for all made a rush to get to their horses; only the captain stopping a moment, to let fly at Donald.\" \"Did he kill him?\" Reuben asked. \"No, sir, the bullet hit him in the body, and the ladies were crying over him when I went in, thinking he was dead. I thought so, too, but I found he was breathing. They poured some brandy down his throat, and presently he opened his eyes; then, as there was nothing for me to do, I thought I had best gallop on and give you the news, for I knew that you would be anxious to know what had taken place.\" \"Thank you, Jones, you did quite right. What an escape those poor ladies have had! Another quarter of an hour, we might have been too late, for those villains would not have kept up the farce long.\" \"No, sir, especially as they were drinking wine. The table was all covered with bottles.\" \"You did not see anything of Jim, did you?\" Reuben inquired. \"No, sir, I did not see or hear anyone stirring about the place.\" Reuben gave a loud cooey. \"That will bring him, if he is anywhere within hearing.\" But no answering call came back. \"I hope nothing has happened to the poor fellow,\" Reuben said, after a pause. \"He could not possibly be here by this time,\" Mr. Barker said. \"The place where he warned the shepherd must be sixty miles from here.\" \"Yes, quite that; but he can run nearly as fast as a horse can go, and he would be ten miles nearer here, in a straight line, than the way the man went round to fetch me.\" As soon as it became light they followed the track, which was plainly visible; but when they had gone half a mile further, there was a general cry of dismay—the ground was trampled in every direction. \"Confound it,\" Mr. Barker said, \"they have done us! Do you see, they have ridden right into the middle of a large herd of cattle, and have driven them off in every direction; and have, no doubt, themselves scattered among the cattle. They may go like that for three or four miles, and then draw off from the cattle at any spot where the ground is hard, and no tracks will be left; to meet again at some appointed place, maybe fifty miles away.\" \"Then you don\u0027t think it\u0027s any use in pursuing them?\" Reuben asked, in a tone of deep disappointment. \"Not a bit in the world,\" Mr. Barker replied decisively. \"If we had a native tracker with us, he might possibly follow one horse\u0027s track among those of all the cattle, discover where he separates from them, and take up his trail; but I doubt, even then, if he would be successful. These fellows know that a strong party is in pursuit of them, and each of them will do everything they can to throw us off the scent. They are sure not to go straight to their place of meeting, but each will take circuitous routes, and will make for thick bush, where it will be next to impossible for even a native to follow them. No, they have done us, this time.\" \"Well, gentlemen, I hope you will all wait as long as you can at the station here. If my boy has not been shot by those scoundrels, he is sure to find his way here; and will be able, in all probability, to set us on the right track. \"At any rate, though the bush rangers have given us the slip, we may congratulate ourselves on our morning\u0027s work. We have at least saved those poor ladies.\" So saying, Reuben turned and, with the party, rode slowly back to the station. On arriving there, they dismounted and unsaddled their horses, and turned them into a paddock close to the house, to feed. Reuben and Mr. Barker then went up to the house. The constable who had been left behind came out. \"Well, Wilkins, how is Mr. Donald, and how are the ladies?\" \"He is sensible now, sir; but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much chance for him.\" \"We ought to get a surgeon, at once,\" Reuben said. \"Who is the nearest, Mr. Barker?\" \"The nearest is Ruskin.\" \"Is there no one nearer than that?\" Reuben asked. \"Why, he lives about halfway between where I was sleeping last night, and my own place. It must be seventy miles away.\" \"He\u0027s the nearest,\" Mr. Barker said; \"take my word for it.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what will be the best plan,\" Reuben\u0027s host of the night before said. \"I will ride at once to Mr. Barker\u0027s and, if he will let me get a fresh horse there, I will gallop straight back to my place, and will send a man off the moment I arrive there to fetch Ruskin. \"It is only eight o\u0027clock now. I can be home before noon, and my man will do the next stage in a little over four hours. If he finds Ruskin in, he can get to my place by ten o\u0027clock at night, and can start again at daybreak; so by eleven o\u0027clock tomorrow he can be here. If he isn\u0027t here by that time, it will be because he was out when my man got there. At any rate, he is sure to start directly he gets the message.\" \"That will be the best plan,\" Reuben agreed; \"and I am sure the ladies will be greatly obliged to you, when I tell them what you have undertaken.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s nothing,\" the settler said. \"We don\u0027t think much of a seventy miles\u0027 ride, here.\" Without any further delay, the settler saddled his horse and went off at a gallop towards Mr. Barker\u0027s, where he was to get a fresh mount. \"And now, how are the ladies, Wilkins?\" \"They are keeping up bravely, sir. I think, as far as they are concerned, Donald\u0027s being hit has done them good. It has given them something to do, and they have not had time to think about what they have gone through, and what a narrow escape they have had.\" \"Which room are they in, Wilkins?\" \"In there to the left, sir.\" \"As you have seen them, Wilkins, you had better go in and tell them that we have sent off, at once, to fetch a surgeon; and that they may rely upon his being here some time tomorrow, we hope before noon. Ask if there is anything that we can do for them, or for Mr. Donald.\" The policeman went in, and Reuben called one of his other men. \"Perkins, do you, Jones, and Rider go in and fetch out the bodies of the men who have been killed. Don\u0027t make more noise than you can help about it. Carry them out to that shed there, and then get a bucket and wash down the floors, wherever there are bloodstains about. I want to have the place straight, so that those poor ladies may avoid seeing anything to recall the scene they have passed through. Of course, you won\u0027t go into the room where they are now.\" Three or four of the settlers at once volunteered to set to work to dig a grave. \"Choose a place a bit away from the house,\" one of them said. \"The farther, the better; it will remind them of this affair, whenever they see it.\" While Reuben was arranging this point, the constable had come out and told Mr. Barker the ladies would be glad to see him. \"It\u0027s a terrible business,\" the settler said to Reuben, as he turned to go into the house. \"I feel downright afraid of facing them. To think how bright and pretty they looked, when I rode over here ten days ago; and now there they are, broken hearted.\" He returned in a few minutes. \"How is Donald?\" was the general question. \"He is hard hit,\" the settler said, \"just under the ribs on the right-hand side. I expect the fellow aimed at his head, but he was starting from his seat at the moment. He isn\u0027t in much pain. I have told them they must keep him perfectly quiet, and not let him move till the surgeon comes. \"They have asked me to see about everything. It\u0027s better we should not be going in and out of the house, as he must be kept perfectly quiet; so I think we had better establish ourselves under that big tree over there. There are some sheep half a mile over that rise, if two of you will go over, kill one and fetch it in. If you will light a fire under that tree, I will hand out from the house flour, tea, sugar, and some cooking things.\" There was a general murmur of approval, for all felt silent and awed at being so close to the house of death and sorrow. Two men got their horses, and rode off to fetch the sheep. The others carried the various articles requisite up to the place fixed for the bivouac, while Wilkins was installed in the house, to assist in anything that might be required there. \"The poor things told me to tell you, captain, how grateful they felt to you for the exertions you have made. I told them how it was we came to be here; and how you had ridden, when you got the news, to be here in time. Mrs. Donald did not say much, poor thing, she seemed half dazed; but her sister, who seems wonderfully cool and collected, quite realized what they had escaped; and there\u0027s many a young fellow who would give a good deal, to win that look of gratitude she gave me when she said: \"\u0027I shall never forget what I owe you all.\u0027 \"I am just going to send off one of my men, to fetch my wife over here. It will be a comfort to the two girls, for they are little more, to have a woman with them.\" \"There\u0027s nothing to be done for Donald, I suppose?\" Reuben asked. \"Nothing. The wound is hardly bleeding at all. I told them that, as far as I knew, the best thing was to keep on it a flannel dipped in warm water, and wrung out; and that they should give him a little broth, or weak brandy and water, whenever he seemed faint. My surgery does not go beyond that. If it had been a smashed finger, or a cut with an axe, or even a broken limb, I might have been some good; for I have seen plenty of accidents of all kinds, since I came out twenty years ago, but a bullet wound in the body is beyond me, altogether.\" After the meal was cooked and eaten, there was a consultation as to what had best be done next. Two or three of the settlers who were married men said that they would go home, as their wives would be anxious about them. The rest agreed to stop for, at any rate, another day. Mr. Barker had found out from Mrs. Donald\u0027s sister the direction in which the sheep and cattle were grazing, and two or three of the party rode off to tell the shepherds and herdsmen—for there were three men on the farm, in addition to those who had been killed—what had happened; and to tell them that they had better bring the sheep and cattle up to within a mile or so of the house, and come in themselves for their stores, when required. A grave was now dug, and the three men buried. In the afternoon Mrs. Barker arrived, and at once took charge of the affairs of the house. In the evening Mr. Barker came up to the fire round which the men were sitting. \"Will you come down to the house, Captain Whitney? The ladies have expressed a wish to see you. They want to thank you for what you have done.\" \"There is nothing to thank about,\" Reuben said. \"I only did my duty as a police officer, and am disgusted at those scoundrels having got away. I have done all I could, since I arrived; but I can\u0027t help feeling, being in command of the force here, that we are to some extent to blame for these fellows carrying on, as they have done for months, without being caught.\" \"I think you had better come down, Whitney,\" Mr. Barker said. \"There is something bright and hopeful about you, and I think that a talk with you might cheer the poor things up a bit. When people are in the state they are, they seem to turn to everyone for a gleam of hope, and comfort.\" \"Oh, if you think I can do any good, of course I will go; though I would rather stop here, by a good way.\" So saying, Reuben went down with Mr. Barker to the house. A lady met them at the door. \"Arthur has just dozed off,\" she whispered. \"Mrs. Barker is sitting by him. She insisted on our coming out. Will you come in here?\" As silently as possible, the two men followed her into the kitchen, and closed the door after them. The fire was blazing brightly, Wilkins having piled on some fresh logs before going out to smoke a pipe. Mrs. Donald was sitting in a dejected attitude, by its right, when her sister entered with Mr. Barker and Reuben. She rose and, coming towards Reuben, said: \"How can we thank you, sir, for the exertions you have made, and for having saved us from I dare not think what fate? As long as we live, my sister and I will bless you.\" \"I can assure you, Mrs. Donald,\" Reuben said, \"that I have done nothing but my duty, and I only regret that we did not arrive half an hour earlier.\" \"Ah, if you had!\" Mrs. Donald said. \"But there—we must not repine—even in my sorrow, I feel how much we have to be thankful for.\" \"Yes, indeed,\" her sister said, \"we have truly reason to be grateful.\" As she spoke, Reuben looked at her more and more intently. He had started when she first spoke, outside the house. \"Good heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"is it possible, or am I dreaming? Surely you are Miss Kate Ellison?\" \"Certainly I am,\" she said in surprise, at his tone; \"but I don\u0027t think—I don\u0027t remember—why, surely it is not Reuben Whitney?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3167/86897.html","bookId":867,"book":{"id":867,"title":"A Final Reckoning","description":"简介： In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers.
