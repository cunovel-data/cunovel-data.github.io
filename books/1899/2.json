He used his thumb to continue to torment her pleasure point while one finger found the entrance to her body. She instinctively gasped. She’d never let anyone to touch her so intimately before. It was…stunningly perfect. Or maybe it was just Luc Angeli who was stunningly perfect. As if to prove her point, Luc returned his mouth to her breast, tugging at her nipple with an insistence that made her feel as if she were going up in flames. At the same time his finger pressed inside her, wrenching another moan from her lips. She could feel him sliding through the tight tissue of her channel, his thumb lightly circling her clit. She clutched his arms, the sensations overwhelming as he allowed his lips to trail up to the pulse thundering at the base of his neck. Moaning softly, she stirred against him. There was a glorious pressure beginning to build between her legs. A tension that was making her entire body clench in anticipation. “Don’t fight it, Maddy,” Luc said. “Let me feel your climax.” He stroked his finger in and out, pressing deeper as he prepared her for his ultimate invasion. She sank her teeth in her lower lip as his thumb continued its magical massage over her clit, and his lips slid up her throat. It was that or scream out her joy as an explosion of pleasure rocked through her, the intensity of her release making her shake all over. “It’s okay, Maddy. I’ve got you.” “Luc,” she breathed. She leaned heavily against him, her knees threatening to buckle. He wrapped his arms tightly around her, pressing his lips to her forehead as she tried to recover from the shocking vibrations that continued to spread through her body. His lips continued to soothe over her upturned face as he lifted her into his arms and headed for her narrow bed. A few steps and he was lowering her onto the mattress before straightening to yank off his clothing. She watched with bemused eyes as his T-shirt was jerked over his head and his boots kicked off before he was shoving his jeans downward. She shivered, her pussy clenching as her gaze slid down his hard, chiseled body to linger on the proud thrust of his erection. God, he was beautiful. All sculpted muscles and bronzed, ruthless male. He paused to remove a condom from the front pocket of his jeans, ripping open the package and slipping it on with practiced ease. Then, moving slowly, as if giving her one last opportunity to change her mind, he placed a knee on the mattress. “I don’t have any experience with virgins, but I suspect this might hurt, Maddy,” he said, his voice tight with strain. “I’ll try to go slow, but I want you.” His lips twisted with a hint of self-derision as his gaze slowly took in her naked curves spread on the bed, lingering for a second on the heels that he insisted she keep on. “I don’t think anything could stop me from taking you tonight.” “I’m ready,” she breathed. Holding her wide gaze, Luc stretched onto the mattress beside her, giving her time to become accustomed to the scorching heat of his bare skin. His fingers ran up and down the front of her body. Traveling from her throat down to her quivering stomach, his light caress set off tiny sparks of excitement. Shockingly, Maddy felt herself melting in anticipation, her legs readily parting as he rolled on top of her. Still keeping their gazes locked, Luc settled between her thighs, the head of his cock forging a slow path into her body. He hesitated for a brief second, then with one steady surge he was seated deeply inside her. Her gasp echoed through the room. It wasn’t true pain, more a sense of being stretched to the max. He gave a harsh groan, his hands framing her face as he studied her with a darkened gaze. “Did I hurt you?” he demanded. Maddy sensed his struggle to leash his hunger, knowing it was taking all his willpower not to pound into her. His fierce desire was as thrilling as the obvious concern in his voice. He wanted her. He really, truly wanted her. “I’m fine,” she assured him, her hands running over the bunched muscles of his shoulders. “Don’t stop.” He gave a choked laugh, his brow damp with perspiration. “It’s no longer a choice, Maddy. You have become a necessity.” She trembled at the husky edge of need in his voice, her hands tentatively exploring the wide expanse of his chest. She’d never realized there could be so much pleasure in touching. The warm, satin skin. The ripple of muscles. The rapid beat of his heart that revealed his out of control emotions. Growing bolder, she explored downward, finding the washboard abs. She could spend the rest of the night stroking her hands over his sculpted form. Luc, however, had other ideas. With a muttered curse, he grasped her hands, pinning them over her head. Her eyes widened, her heart missing a beat at the savage need that smoldered in his eyes. “Don’t move,” he growled, his voice barely recognizable. “I’m hanging on by a thread, sweetheart.” Maddy savored the exquisite moment. This was what she’d craved. The feel of him buried deep inside her, the intoxicating knowledge she’d driven him to the edge of reason. It all combined to stir her excitement to a fever pitch. With obvious care, Luc withdrew until just the tip remained inside her, then as her hips lifted to maintain the contact, he was surging forward. She shuddered at the erotic slide of his cock inside her, his breath searing over her face as he pressed his forehead to hers. “Luc…” she moaned, instinctively wrapping her legs around his hips. “It feels so good.” “Shit, Maddy,” he groaned, sinking even deeper. “You’re killing me.” Maddy wasn’t sure what he meant, but at the moment it didn’t matter. That delectable, addictive pleasure was beginning to build as he thrust into her with a ruthless rhythm. “I don’t know what to do,” she rasped, needing to give him the same bliss that was jolting through her. “Just let me please you,” “You do,” she whimpered, her body bowing beneath him. Her heart felt as if it was going to beat out of her chest, her nails digging into his fingers that were wrapped around her wrists. “You’re the only one who could ever please me.” “You shouldn’t tell a man that,” he muttered, burying his face in the curve of her neck as his hands lowered to cup her ass, angling her for even deeper penetration. “Especially not one with my ego.” Her toes curled as shockwaves of pleasure rushed through her. “You know how I feel,” she recklessly groaned. “It’s always been you.” A dark, possessive satisfaction blazed in his eyes. “You’re mine.” She smiled. She was. It might be politically incorrect. It might even be foolish. But she understood she belonged to this man on a primitive level. “Always,” she breathed, the word a solemn promise. Luc groaned, his fingers digging into the soft flesh of her ass. “God, you feel perfect, Maddy. So tight around my cock…” He lowered his head to tongue the tip of her breast. “Come for me.” “Luc.” She arched upward, her breath wrenched from her lungs as he reached between them to tease her swollen clit. “Come for me, sweetheart,” he rasped. “I’m not going to last.” She cried out as her orgasm swelled to a near painful peak, before it exploded through her with the force of a nuclear bomb. Good lord. “Yes,” he hissed, plunging swiftly in and out of her body. His lips found hers as he grabbed her hips, giving one last thrust before he went rigid against her, his groan of completion rumbling from the depths of his chest. Remaining lodged inside her, Luc spread tiny kisses over her face, his tenderness bringing tears of joy to her eyes. She’d fantasized about this moment since she’d first caught sight of Luc walking down the halls of the local high school. She’d been a lowly freshman and he’d been ‘Mr. Popular.’ Even worse, he was the son of Vigo Angeli, owner of two high-end casinos. It was rumored he was worth millions, while Maddy was the daughter of a barmaid who rarely remembered she had a child who shared her cheap trailer on the edge of town. It’d seemed an impossible dream. But now… “I love you, Luc,” she murmured, her heart overflowing with happiness. Instantly he stiffened, his breath hissing between his clenched teeth, as if she’d struck him instead of confessing her love. Then, before she knew what was happening, he was pulling out of her and shoving himself off the bed, his expression hard as he reached to grab his jeans off the floor. “Don’t make this into something it’s not, Maddy,” he warned, his voice painfully harsh. Suddenly chilled to the bone, Maddy reached for the sheet, covering her naked body. “Luc, what’s wrong?” “Everything.” He dressed with an efficient swiftness. “This should never have happened.” Shivering with a sense of baffled betrayal, she watched as Luc moved toward the door. “You’re leaving?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/first-rapture-the-rapture-1/page-2.html","bookId":1899,"book":{"id":1899,"title":"First Rapture (The Rapture #1)","description":"Storyline: First Rapture (The Rapture #1) Madison Philips has only one reason to return to Las Vegas: Luc Angeli.
