Not when her husband was an investor in Luc’s real estate company. Much to everyone’s astonishment, including his own, Luc had walked away from his father’s casino empire five years ago. He was done trying to earn the old man’s respect, choosing instead to try and halt the steady decline of the city he loved. Buying corporate buildings and new construction in foreclosure, he used his contacts spread throughout the world to flip the properties and bring in new businesses. In some ways he was still in the gambling business. Only this time it was with his money and the money of his investors. And he’d been highly successful. But he was in the delicate process of expanding his business, which meant rubbing elbows with the rich and powerful to keep his investors happy. It also meant he couldn’t just leave when his current stalker followed him onto the balcony overlooking the gaudy, spectacular beauty of Vegas. “Please, Luc,” the voluptuous redhead pleaded, her fake lashes framing her green eyes like stiff spikes, and her lips slick with red gloss. “Would you just listen to me?” Luc downed the last of his aged whiskey, wishing to hell he’d never given in to his rash impulse to ask out the persistent female. His only excuse was that he’d been bored and searching for something he couldn’t seem to find. Something he still couldn’t find. “I told you not to follow me here, Sherri,” he growled, shaking off her clinging grip. “What choice did I have?” she pouted. “You won’t accept my phone calls.” “Because we have nothing to say.” He sent her a warning glare that not even she could fail to comprehend. “Walk away or I’ll tell your father about that vial of white power you keep in your purse.” Her expression abruptly hardened, the green eyes glittering like chips of emeralds. “Bastard.” With a flounce, Sherri turned to head back into the crowded party, leaving behind the overwhelming stench of her expensive perfume. Luc grimaced, wishing to god he’d made up an excuse to avoid the evening. Especially when yet another female appeared in the open doorway, her slender form outlined by the lights of the ballroom. “The Dark Angel strikes again,” a low, delectably feminine voice purred. “Do you actually keep a tally of how many hearts you’ve broken over the years?” “Hardly. I…” His annoyed denial died away as the woman stepped onto the balcony, the moonlight gliding over her tall, willowy body. His breath caught in his throat. Her feminine shape was shown to advantage in the long black Dior gown that split up the sides to reveal slender, impossibly long legs, and a tight bodice that hugged the curve of her breasts. Her glossy dark hair was left free to tumble over her bare shoulders, the silken strands emphasizing the creamy perfection of her skin. A shockingly intense arousal blasted through him, followed by an equally shocking recognition. “Christ. Maddy?” A cool smile touched her lips. “It’s Madison.” Luc’s boredom was seared away by a thrilling sense of pleasure as he studied the female who’d invaded his dreams a hundred times over the years. “Madison,” he murmured, his gaze drinking in her astonishing beauty. She’d always been pretty. A fresh-faced innocent who’d tempted him more than he’d ever wanted to admit. Until that night… Luc hissed as he instantly became hard at the memory of sliding into the tight, exquisite heat of her body. Shit. Nothing had ever felt so good. “Long time, no see,” she said, moving to lean her hip against the iron balustrade, her movements hypnotically graceful. Luc smiled, a tingle of erotic anticipation racing through his body. “That’s not entirely true. I’ve seen you everywhere over the years,” he admitted, belatedly realizing why he’d been so obsessed with following her rocketing launch into fame. He’d never gotten her out of his system. Madison Philips was not only the one who gotten away, but she was the only one worth keeping. “Magazines, billboards, even TV. The face of Tivago Tequila.” He lifted his empty glass in a toast of genuine appreciation. This woman had every excuse to fail, and instead she’d risen above her past to become an international star. “It was a great campaign. And very clever of you to take your payment in stocks rather than cash.” “Modeling has a limited lifespan.” She shrugged aside his admiration, her pale features unreadable. Odd. Before she’d left Vegas her face had revealed her every emotion. He’d never forgotten the devotion that had glowed in her spectacular hazel eyes when she glanced in his direction. Or the sated pleasure on her face as she’d reached her climax in his arms. Now he had no idea what she was thinking. “It seemed prudent to have a nest egg for the future.” “Especially when you’re capable of taking that nest egg and turning it into a rapidly expanding business.” “I’m flattered.” Her smile didn’t reach her eyes. “I didn’t know you bothered to notice a woman unless she’s in your bed.” Luc grimaced. Madison had crossed his path at a difficult time in his life. When he was young he’d done his best to earn his father’s love. He’d been a top athlete. He’d made straight A’s. And following in his father’s footsteps, he’d bedded every willing female who’d crossed his path. He’d just accepted the painful truth that there was nothing in the world he could do to ever win his father’s approval, let alone his love, when Madison had invited him to her party. He’d been determined to say no. She was an innocent and he was…truly screwed up. She deserved better. But none of his good intentions had the power to overcome his fierce need to taste her forbidden desire. “I suppose I deserve that,” he grimly admitted. “I’ve always regretted…” She arched a brow. “What?” “Hurting you.” He set his empty glass on a low table, moving so he was close enough to catch the delicate scent of vanilla that clung to her skin. His erection pressed painfully against his zipper, making him glad the black tuxedo jacket covered his arousal. Considering their current conversation, he didn’t think she would appreciate the knowledge that he was already plotting how quickly he could get her into his bed. “I know it’s hard to believe, but that was never my intention.” “Is that an apology?” His gaze slid over her stunningly beautiful face, lingering on the lush fullness of her mouth. His breath tangled in his throat. Christ, how many times had he imagined those lips wrapped around the tip of his cock? Too many to count. “I apologize for not being the man you needed me to be when I took your virginity, but truthfully, I can’t be sorry that I made love to you,” he admitted, his voice thick. “It’s a night that’s branded into my memory.” An indefinable emotion flared through the hazel eyes before she was lowering her thick lashes that were thankfully natural. In fact, he realized with stab of male satisfaction, everything about this woman was natural, from the rich color of her hair to the perfect swell of her small breasts. “There are no doubt a lot of nights branded in your memory,” she said in dry tones. “There are some more special than others.” “Nice line. Did you make it up yourself or do you have someone on your staff that makes up cheesy lines?” Luc hesitated, his lips twisting into a rueful smile as he was forced to accept that this female was no longer the giddy schoolgirl who’d worshipped the ground he walked on. It was going to take more than casual charm to earn his way back into her bed. The knowledge only intensified his glorious sense of anticipation. There was nothing he loved more than a challenge. He took a step closer, barely resisting the urge to stroke his fingers through the satin-smooth strands of her hair. “What are you doing in Las Vegas?” he asked. A smile touched her lips. “Tying up some loose ends.” Hmm. He sensed there was a mystery behind her words. “Alone?” She lifted her lashes, her hazel eyes running a blatant survey down the length of his body. “Are you asking me if I have a significant other with me?” A raw surge of need coiled his muscles as her eyes traveled back to meet his smoldering gaze. “That’s exactly what I’m asking,” he admitted without hesitation. “What about the lovely Sherri?” Her words were mocking, but Luc didn’t miss the edge in her voice. Was she jealous? Hell, he hoped so. God knew he’d pummel any man at the party who tried to put his hands on this woman. For tonight she belonged to him. “I asked her out over a month ago,” he explained. “Five minutes into our date I knew I’d made a serious error in judgment, but with my only options to stick it out or humiliate her by simply walking away, I chose to be a gentleman.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/first-rapture-the-rapture-1/page-4.html","bookId":1899,"book":{"id":1899,"title":"First Rapture (The Rapture #1)","description":"Storyline: First Rapture (The Rapture #1) Madison Philips has only one reason to return to Las Vegas: Luc Angeli.
