{"id":40442,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII. SILAS TRIPP MAKES A DISCOVERY.","content":"When Silas Tripp went into his store the next day he was startled to find a window in the rear was partially open. \"How did that window come open, Abel?\" he asked, as Abel Wood entered the store. \"I don\u0027t know, sir.\" \"It must have been you that opened it,\" said his employer, sternly. \"I didn\u0027t do it, Mr. Tripp, honest I didn\u0027t,\" declared Abel, earnestly. \"Then how did it come open, that\u0027s what I want to know?\" \"I am sure I can\u0027t tell.\" \"Somebody might have come in during the night and robbed the store.\" \"So there might.\" \"It\u0027s very mysterious. Such things didn\u0027t happen when Chester was here.\" Abel made no answer, but began to sweep out the store, his first morning duty. When Silas spoke of the store being robbed he had no idea that such a robbing had taken place, but he went to the money drawer and opened it to make sure all was safe. Instantly there was a cry of dismay. \"Abel!\" he exclaimed, \"I\u0027ve been robbed. There\u0027s a lot of money missing.\" Abel stopped sweeping and turned pale. \"Is that so, Mr. Tripp?\" he asked, faintly. \"Yes, there\u0027s—lemme see. There\u0027s been burglars here. Oh, this is terrible!\" \"Who could have done it, Mr. Tripp?\" \"I dunno, but the store was entered last night. I never shall feel safe again,\" groaned Silas. \"Didn\u0027t they leave no traces?\" \"Ha! here\u0027s a handkerchief,\" said Mr. Tripp, taking the article from the top of a flour barrel, \"and yes, by gracious, it\u0027s marked Chester Rand.\" \"You don\u0027t think he took the money?\" ejaculated Abel, in open-eyed wonder. \"Of course it must have been him! He knew just where I kept the money, and he could find his way about in the dark, he knew the store so well.\" \"I didn\u0027t think Chester would do such a thing.\" \"That\u0027s how he came by his five-dollar bill. He came in bold as brass and paid me with my own money—the young rascal!\" \"But how could he do it if the money was took last night? It was two or three days ago he paid you the five-dollar bill.\" This was a poser, but Mr. Tripp was equal to the emergency. \"He must have robbed me before,\" he said. \"You haven\u0027t missed money before, have you?\" \"Not to my knowledge, but he must have took it. Abel, I want you to go right over to the Widow Rand\u0027s and tell Chester I want to see him. I dunno but I\u0027d better send the constable after him.\" \"Shall I carry him his handkerchief?\" \"No, and don\u0027t tell him it\u0027s been found. I don\u0027t want to put him on his guard.\" Abel put his broom behind the door and betook himself to the house of Mrs. Rand. The widow herself opened the door. \"Is Chester at home?\" asked Abel. \"Yes, he\u0027s eating his breakfast. Do you want to see him?\" \"Well, Mr. Tripp wants to see him.\" \"Possibly he wants Chester to give him a little extra help,\" she thought. \"Won\u0027t you come in and take a cup of coffee while Chester is finishing his breakfast?\" she said. \"Thank you, ma\u0027am.\" Abel was a boy who was always ready to eat and drink, and he accepted the invitation with alacrity. \"So Mr. Tripp wants to see me?\" said Chester. \"Do you know what it\u0027s about?\" \"He\u0027ll tell you,\" answered Abel, evasively. Chester was not specially interested or excited. He finished his breakfast in a leisurely manner, and then taking his hat, went out with Abel. It occurred to him that Mr. Tripp might be intending to discharge Abel, and wished to see if he would return to his old place. \"So you don\u0027t know what he wants to see me about?\" he asked. \"Well, I have an idea,\" answered Abel, in a mysterious tone. \"What is it, then?\" \"Oh, I dassn\u0027t tell.\" \"Look here, Abel, I won\u0027t stir a step till you do tell me. You are acting very strangely.\" \"Well, somethin\u0027 terrible has happened,\" Abel ejaculated, in excited tones. \"What\u0027s it?\" \"The store was robbed last night.\" \"The store was robbed?\" repeated Chester. \"What was taken?\" \"Oh, lots and lots of money was taken from the drawer, and the window in the back of the store was left open.\" \"I\u0027m sorry to hear it. I didn\u0027t know there was anybody in Wyncombe that would do such things. Does Mr. Tripp suspect anybody?\" \"Yes, he does.\" \"Who is it?\" \"He thinks you done it.\" Chester stopped abruptly and looked amazed. \"Why, the man must be crazy! What on earth makes him think I would stoop to do such a thing?\" \"\u0027Cause your handkerchief was found on a flour barrel \u0027side of the money drawer.\" \"My handkerchief! Who says it was my handkerchief?\" \"Your name was on it—in one corner; I seed it myself.\" Then a light dawned upon Chester. The tramp whom he and his mother had entertained the evening before, must have picked up his handkerchief, and left it in the store to divert suspicion from himself. The detective instinct was born within Chester, and now he felt impatient to have the investigation proceed. \"Come on, Abel,\" he said, \"I want to see about this matter.\" \"Well, you needn\u0027t walk so plaguy fast, wouldn\u0027t if I was you.\" \"Why not?\" \"\u0027Cause you\u0027ll probably have to go to jail. I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027d do.\" \"Well?\" \"I\u0027d hook it.\" \"You mean run away?\" \"Yes.\" \"That\u0027s the last thing I\u0027d do. Mr. Tripp would have a right to think I was guilty in that case.\" \"Well, ain\u0027t you?\" \"Abel Wood, I have a great mind to give you a licking. Don\u0027t you know me any better than that?\" \"Then why did you leave the handkerchief on the flour barrel?\" \"That\u0027ll come out in due time.\" They were near the store where Mr. Tripp was impatiently waiting for their appearance. He did not anticipate Abel\u0027s staying to breakfast, and his suspicions were excited. \"I\u0027ll bet Chester Rand has left town with the money,\" he groaned. \"Oh, it\u0027s awful to have your hard earnin\u0027s carried off so sudden. I\u0027ll send Chester to jail unless he returns it—every cent of it.\" Here Abel entered the store, followed by Chester. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81390.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
