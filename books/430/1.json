{"id":40436,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. SILAS TRIPP.","content":"Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in other local offices. The store was in the center of the village, nearly opposite the principal church—there were two—and here it was that the townspeople gathered to hear and discuss the news. Silas Tripp had one assistant, a stout, pleasant-looking boy of fifteen, who looked attractive, despite his well-worn suit. Chester Rand was the son of a widow, who lived in a tiny cottage about fifty rods west of the Presbyterian church, of which, by the way, Silas Tripp was senior deacon, for he was a leader in religious as well as secular affairs. Chester\u0027s father had died of pneumonia about four years before the story commences, leaving his widow the cottage and about two hundred and fifty dollars. This sum little by little had melted, and a month previous the last dollar had been spent for the winter\u0027s supply of coal. Mrs. Rand had earned a small income by plain sewing and binding shoes for a shoe shop in the village, but to her dismay the announcement had just been made that the shop would close through the winter on account of the increased price of leather and overproduction during the year. \"What shall we do, Chester?\" she asked, in alarm, when the news came. \"We can\u0027t live on your salary, and I get very little sewing to do.\" \"No, mother,\" said Chester, his own face reflecting her anxiety; \"we can\u0027t live on three dollars a week.\" \"I have been earning two dollars by binding shoes,\" said Mrs. Rand. \"It has been hard enough to live on five dollars a week, but I don\u0027t know how we can manage on three.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do, mother. I\u0027ll ask Mr. Tripp to raise my pay to four dollars a week.\" \"But will he do it? He is a very close man, and always pleading poverty.\" \"But I happen to know that he has ten thousand dollars invested in Pennsylvania Railroad stock. I overheard him saying so to Mr. Gardner.\" \"Ten thousand dollars! It seems a fortune!\" sighed Mrs. Rand. \"Why do some people have so much and others so little?\" \"It beats me, mother. But I don\u0027t think either of us would exchange places with Silas Tripp with all his money. By the way, mother, Mr. Tripp is a widower. Why don\u0027t you set your cap for him?\" Mrs. Rand smiled, as her imagination conjured up the weazened and wrinkled face of the village storekeeper, with his gray hair standing up straight on his head like a natural pompadour. \"If you want Mr. Tripp for a stepfather,\" she said, \"I will see what I can do to ingratiate myself with him.\" \"No, a thousand times no!\" replied Chester, with a shudder. \"I\u0027d rather live on one meal a day than have you marry him.\" \"I agree with you, Chester. We will live for each other, and hope for something to turn up.\" \"I hope the first thing to turn up will be an increase of salary. To-morrow is New Year\u0027s Day, and it will be a good time to ask.\" Accordingly, that evening, just as the store was about to close, Chester gathered up courage and said: \"Mr. Tripp.\" \"Well, that\u0027s my name,\" said Silas, looking over his iron-bowed spectacles. \"To-morrow is New Year\u0027s Day.\" \"What if \u0027tis? I reckon I knew that without your tellin\u0027 me.\" \"I came here last New Year\u0027s Day. I\u0027ve been here a year.\" \"What if you have?\" \"And I thought perhaps you might be willing to raise my salary to four dollars a week,\" continued Chester, hurriedly. \"Oho, that\u0027s what you\u0027re after, is it?\" said Silas, grimly. \"You think I\u0027m made of money, I reckon. Now, don\u0027t you?\" \"No, I don\u0027t; but, Mr. Tripp, mother and I find it very hard to get along, really we do. She won\u0027t have any more shoes to bind for three months to come, on account of the shoe shop\u0027s closing.\" \"It\u0027s going to hurt me, too,\" said Silas, with a frown. \"When one business suspends it affects all the rest. I\u0027ll have mighty hard work to make both ends meet.\" This struck Chester as ludicrous, but he did not feel inclined to laugh. Here was Silas Tripp gathering in trade from the entire village and getting not a little in addition from outlying towns, complaining that he would find it hard to make both ends meet, though everyone said that he did not spend one-third of his income. On the whole, things did not look very encouraging. \"Perhaps,\" he said, nervously, \"you would raise me to three dollars and a half?\" \"What is the boy thinkin\u0027 of? You must think I\u0027m made of money. Why, three dollars is han\u0027some pay for what little you do.\" \"Why, I work fourteen hours a day,\" retorted Chester. \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re gettin\u0027 lazy. Boys shouldn\u0027t complain of their work. The fact is, Chester, I feel as if I was payin\u0027 you too much.\" \"Too much! Three dollars a week too much!\" \"Too much, considerin\u0027 the state of business, and yourself bein\u0027 a boy. I\u0027ve been meanin\u0027 to tell you that I\u0027ve got a chance to get a cheaper boy.\" \"Who is it?\" asked Chester, in dismay. \"It\u0027s Abel Wood. Abel Wood is every mite as big and strong as you are, and he come round last evenin\u0027 and said he\u0027d work for two dollars and a quarter a week.\" \"I couldn\u0027t work for that,\" said Chester. \"I don\u0027t mind bein\u0027 generous, considerin\u0027 you\u0027ve been working for me more than a year. I\u0027ll give you two dollars and a half. That\u0027s twenty-five cents more\u0027n the Wood boy is willin\u0027 to take.\" \"Abel Wood doesn\u0027t know anything about store work.\" \"I\u0027ll soon learn him. Sitooated as I am, I feel that I must look after every penny,\" and Mr. Tripp\u0027s face looked meaner and more weazened than ever as he fixed his small, bead-like eyes on his boy clerk. \"Then I guess I\u0027ll have to leave you, Mr. Tripp,\" said Chester, with a deep feeling of disgust and dismay. \"Do just as you like,\" said his employer. \"You\u0027re onreasonable to expect to get high pay when business is dull.\" \"High pay!\" repeated Chester, bitterly. \"Three dollars a week!\" \"It\u0027s what I call high pay. When I was a boy, I only earned two dollars a week.\" \"Money would go further when you were a boy.\" \"Yes, it did. Boys wasn\u0027t so extravagant in them days.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you were ever extravagant, Mr. Tripp,\" said Chester, with a tinge of sarcasm which his employer didn\u0027t detect. \"No, I wasn\u0027t. I don\u0027t want to brag, but I never spent a cent foolishly. Do you know how much money I spent the first three months I was at work?\" \"A dollar?\" guessed Chester. \"A dollar!\" repeated Mr. Tripp, in a tone of disapproval. \"No, I only spent thirty-seven cents.\" \"Then I don\u0027t wonder you got rich,\" said Chester, with a curl of the lip. \"I ain\u0027t rich,\" said Silas Tripp, cautiously. \"Who told you I was?\" \"Everybody says so.\" \"Then everybody is wrong. I\u0027m a leetle \u0027forehanded, that\u0027s all.\" \"I\u0027ve heard people say you could afford to give up work and live on the interest of your money.\" Silas Tripp held up his hands as if astounded. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t so,\" he said, sharply. \"If I gave up business, I\u0027d soon be in the poorhouse. Well, what do you say? Will you stay along and work for two dollars and a half a week?\" \"I couldn\u0027t do it,\" said Chester, troubled. \"All right! It\u0027s jest as you say. Your week ends to-morrow night. If you see Abel Wood, you can tell him I want to see him.\" \"I will,\" answered Chester, bitterly. As he walked home he felt very despondent. Wouldn\u0027t it have been better, he asked himself, to accept reduced wages than to give up his job? It would have been hard enough to attempt living on two dollars and a half a week, but that was better than no income at all. And yet, it looked so mean in Silas Tripp to present such an alternative, when he was abundantly able to give him the increase he asked for. \"I must tell mother and see what she thinks about it,\" he said to himself. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81384.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
