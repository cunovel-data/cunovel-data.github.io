{"id":40471,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVI. A GREAT SURPRISE.","content":"From New York to Tacoma is a long journey. Over three thousand miles must be traversed by rail, but the trip is far from tiresome. Chester and his companion thoroughly enjoyed it. All was new and strange, and the broad spaces through which they passed were full of interest. They stopped at Niagara Falls, but only for a few hours, and spent a day in Chicago. Then they were whirled onward to St. Paul and Minneapolis, and later on over the broad plains of North Dakota and through the mountains of Montana. \"I never thought the country was so large before,\" said Chester to Edward. \"You have been over the ground once before.\" \"Yes; but part of it was during the night, It is pleasant to see it once more. Many of the places have grown considerably, though it is only two years since I came from Portland.\" Chester made some agreeable acquaintances. An unsociable traveler misses many of the profitable results of his journey, besides finding time hang heavily on his hands. Just after leaving Bismarck, in North Dakota, Chester\u0027s attention was called to an old man, whose white hair and wrinkled face indicated that he had passed the age of seventy years. The conductor came through the car, collecting tickets. The old man searched for his, and an expression of dismay overspread his face. \"I can\u0027t find my ticket,\" he said. \"That is unfortunate. Where did you come from?\" \"From Buffalo.\" \"When did you last see your ticket?\" \"I stopped over one night in Bismarck, and had to share my room with a young man, for the hotel was crowded. I think he must have picked my pocket of the ticket.\" \"Did you know the ticket was missing when you boarded the train?\" \"No, sir. I did not think to look.\" \"Your case is unfortunate. How far are you going?\" \"To Tacoma. I have a son there.\" \"I am afraid you will have to pay the fare from here. I have no discretion in the matter, and cannot allow you to ride without a ticket.\" \"Don\u0027t you believe my ticket was stolen?\" asked the old man, in a state of nervous agitation. \"Yes, I believe it. I don\u0027t think a man of your age would deceive me. But I cannot let you travel without paying for another.\" \"I haven\u0027t money enough,\" said the old man, piteously. \"If you will wait till I reach Tacoma my son will give me money to pay you.\" \"I am not allowed to do that. I think you will have to get out at the next station.\" The old man was much agitated. \"It is very hard,\" he sighed. \"I—I don\u0027t know what to do.\" Chester had listened to this conversation with great sympathy for the unfortunate traveler, on account of his age and apparent helplessness. \"How much is the fare to Tacoma from this point?\" he asked. \"In the neighborhood of fifty dollars,\" answered the conductor. \"Will your son be able to pay this?\" asked Chester. \"Oh, yes,\" answered the old man. \"William has been doin\u0027 well. He is going to build a large hotel in Tacoma—he and another man.\" \"Then,\" said Chester, \"I will advance you what money you need. You can give me a memorandum, so that I can collect it from your son.\" \"Heaven bless you, young man!\" said the old man, fervently. \"You are indeed a friend to me who am but a stranger. I am sure you will prosper.\" \"Thank you.\" \"What a fellow you are, Chester!\" said Edward. \"You will make yourself poor helping others.\" \"I shall sleep better for having aided the old man,\" answered Chester. The rest of the journey was uneventful. The two boys went at once to Tacoma, as Chester felt that the gentlemen who were negotiating for his lots were probably in a hurry to arrange for the building of the hotel. After establishing themselves at a hotel and eating dinner, they went at once to the office of Dean \u0026 Downie, the real estate agents from whom Chester had received a letter. Here a surprise awaited him. Standing at a desk in the rear of the office was a figure that looked familiar. The man turned as the door opened to admit Chester, and the latter recognized to his great astonishment his old enemy—David Mullins!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81419.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
