{"id":40474,"no":39,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIX. MAKING A WILL.","content":"\"Mr. Coleman,\" said Trimble, with suavity, \"this is my wife, Mrs. Trimble.\" The lawyer bowed. \"I believe you wish to execute a will, Mrs. Trimble?\" said he. \"Yes,\" answered the poor mother, in a spiritless tone. Various questions were asked in relation to the property, and then the lawyer seated himself at a table and wrote the formal part of the will. \"I understand you wish to leave the entire property to your husband?\" he said, in a tone of inquiry. \"In the event of my son\u0027s death,\" interpolated Mrs. Trimble. \"But, my dear, he is dead,\" said Abner Trimble, with a slight frown. \"I would prefer to have it expressed in this way.\" \"I am sure,\" continued Trimble, annoyed, \"that Mr. Coleman will consider it unnecessary.\" \"I see no objections to it,\" said the lawyer. \"Of course, the son being dead, it won\u0027t count.\" \"Mr. Coleman,\" explained Mrs. Trimble, \"I have no reason to doubt my poor son\u0027s death, but I didn\u0027t see him die, and there may have been a mistake.\" \"How can there be?\" demanded Trimble, impatiently. \"Didn\u0027t my friend Floyd see him drowned?\" \"He may have been mistaken. Besides, he only says he did not see him after the boat upset. He may have been picked up by some other boat.\" For the first time Trimble and Floyd saw the flaw in the story, which had been invented by Trimble himself. \"Was there any boat near, Floyd?\" asked Trimble, winking significantly. \"No, sir; not within a quarter of a mile.\" \"Edward could swim. He may have reached one by swimming.\" This was news to Trimble. He had not been aware that his stepson could swim. \"Under the circumstances,\" said the lawyer, \"I think Mrs. Trimble is right.\" Trimble looked panic-stricken. Knowing that Edward Granger was still living he recognized the fact that such a will would do him no good. \"If he were alive he would let us know,\" he said, after a pause. \"Probably he would.\" \"So that we may conclude he is dead.\" \"It might be stipulated that if the missing son does not appear within three years from the time the will is made he may be regarded as dead?\" suggested the lawyer. \"One year would be sufficient, it seems to me,\" put in Trimble. \"I would rather make it three,\" said his wife. Abner Trimble looked disappointed, but did not dare object. The lawyer continued to write. \"I understand, then,\" he observed, \"that you bequeath all your estate to your husband, in the event of your son being decided to be dead.\" Mrs. Trimble paused to consider. \"I think,\" she said, \"I will leave the sum of five thousand dollars to charitable purposes as a memorial of Edward.\" \"I don\u0027t think much of charitable societies,\" growled Trimble. \"Some of them do a great deal of good,\" said the lawyer. \"Are there any particular societies which you would wish to remember, Mrs. Trimble?\" \"I leave the choice to my executor,\" said the lady. \"Whom have you selected for that office?\" \"Will you serve?\" she asked. \"Then you don\u0027t care to appoint Mr. Trimble?\" \"No, I think not.\" \"It is customary to appoint the husband, isn\u0027t it, Mr. Coleman?\" asked Abner. \"It is quite often done.\" \"I would prefer you,\" said Mrs. Trimble, decidedly. \"If it will ease your mind, I will take the office, Mrs. Trimble.\" \"Now,\" said the lawyer, after a brief interval; \"I will read the draft of the will as I have written it, and you can see if it meets your views.\" He had about half completed reading the document when there was heard a sharp ring at the doorbell. Then there were steps on the stairs. A terrible surprise was in store for Mrs. Trimble. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81422.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
