{"id":40459,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. INTRODUCES MR. SHARPLEIGH, THE DETECTIVE.","content":"Chester was not so much disturbed by his discharge, so far as it related to his own welfare, as by the thought that Mr. Fairchild\u0027s interests were threatened. He felt that his absent employer ought to be notified at once. Accordingly he went to the Fifth Avenue Hotel and telegraphed to Chicago: \"I am discharged. Felix Gordon is in my place. Will write.\" A few hours later Chester received the following message at his lodgings. \"Your telegram received. Will write you instructions. Fairchild.\" Two days later Chester received a letter requesting him to call at once on a well-known detective, give him all the available information and request him to keep careful watch of Mr. Mullins and his operations, and interfere if any steps were taken prejudicial to Mr. Fairchild\u0027s interests. Chester called on the detective and was fortunate enough to find him in. He expected to see a large man of impressive manners and imposing presence, and was rather disappointed when he found a small personage under the average height, exceedingly plain and unpretentious, who might easily have been taken for an humble clerk on a salary of ten or twelve dollars a week. Mr. Sharpleigh listened attentively to Chester\u0027s communication, and then proceeded to ask questions. \"Do you know anything of Mr. Mullins outside of the office?\" he asked. \"A little, sir.\" \"Has he any bad habits? Is he extravagant? Does he drink?\" \"I have never seen any evidence that he drank,\" answered Chester. \"Perhaps he may drink a glass of wine or beer occasionally.\" \"I don\u0027t mean that. He is not what may be called an intemperate man?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Any other objectionable habits?\" \"I think he gambles.\" \"Ha! this is important. What makes you think so?\" \"He seems to be intimate with a man who, I am told, is a well-known gambler.\" \"Who is it?\" \"Dick Ralston.\" \"Ralston is as well known as any gambler in the city. How is it that this has not excited the suspicions of Mr. Fairchild?\" \"I don\u0027t think Mr. Fairchild knows it.\" \"Then Ralston doesn\u0027t come into the office?\" \"He did not when Mr. Fairchild was in town. As soon as Mr. Fairchild left he came at once, and now spends considerable time there.\" \"Probably Mullins owes him money lost in gambling.\" \"I think he does. I overheard him one day urging Mr. Mullins to give him money.\" \"That makes it probable. Do you know if they keep company outside?\" \"I have seen them walking late in the evening.\" \"Why do you think Mr. Mullins discharged you?\" \"He wanted the place for a cousin of his.\" \"What name?\" \"Felix Gordon.\" \"Is he there now?\" \"Yes; Felix was taken on when I was discharged.\" \"At once?\" \"Yes. He was in the office, probably waiting for the vacancy.\" \"The plan seems to have been cut and dried. What sort of a boy is Felix?\" \"I don\u0027t know him very well. He seems on confidential terms with Mr. Mullins.\" \"Did the bookkeeper have any other reasons for disliking you?\" \"Yes; I interfered to prevent his cheating a mechanic out of his month\u0027s rent.\" \"State the circumstances.\" Chester did so. \"How long has Mr. Mullins been in Mr. Fairchild\u0027s employ?\" \"About five years, I think I have heard.\" \"That speaks well for him. Probably his acquaintance with Ralston is recent, or he would have done something before this to insure his discharge.\" There was a short silence, and Chester asked: \"Have you any more questions, Mr. Sharpleigh?\" \"Not at present. Will you give me your address?\" Chester did so. \"I will send for you if I need you. I think you can help me materially. You seem to have a clear head, and are observing.\" It was the evening for Chester to call at Prof. Hazlitt\u0027s. \"I passed your office this morning, Chester,\" said Arthur Burks, \"and thought of calling in, but I was in haste.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t have found me, Arthur. I am discharged.\" \"What!\" exclaimed Arthur, in surprise. \"What complaint does Mr. Fairchild make of you?\" \"None at all. He is out of the city. The bookkeeper, who dislikes me, discharged me, and gave the place to his cousin.\" \"I am awfully sorry. What will you do?\" \"I have some money saved up. Besides, I shall devote more time to drawing. I made a sketch yesterday which Mr. Conrad thinks I will get ten dollars for.\" \"That is fine. I never earned ten dollars in my life.\" \"You have never felt obliged to work, except in school.\" \"I take care not to injure my health in studying,\" said Arthur, with a laugh. \"I will speak to uncle Edgar, and he will arrange to have you come four times a week instead of two. Then you will earn more money from him.\" \"Thank you, Arthur. I should like that.\" Prof. Hazlitt, on being spoken to, ratified this arrangement, so that Chester\u0027s mind was easy. He knew now that he would be able to support himself and more, too. Chester soon had something more to encourage him. He received at his lodgings the following letter: \"Mr. Chester Rand. \"Dear Sir: We are about to establish a new comic weekly, which we shall call The Ph?nix. It is backed by sufficient capital to insure its success. Our attention has been called to some illustrations which you have furnished to some of our successful contemporaries, and we shall be glad to secure your services. We may be able to throw considerable work in your way. Please call at our office as soon as possible. \"Editors of the Ph?nix.\" Chester was quite exhilarated by this letter. He felt that it was a proof of his growing popularity as an artist, and this was particularly gratifying. Besides, his income would be largely, at any rate considerably, increased. He lost no time in presenting himself at the office of The Ph?nix. It was located in a large office building on Nassau Street. He took the elevator and went upstairs to the sixth floor. On the door of a room a little way from the elevator he saw the name, and knocked. \"Come in!\" was the response. Chester opened the door and found himself in the presence of a man of about forty, with a profusion of brown hair shading a pleasant countenance. He looked up inquiringly as Chester entered. \"Is this the editor of The Ph?nix?\" inquired Chester, respectfully. \"The Ph?nix will have no existence till next week,\" answered the other, pleasantly. \"I expect to be its editor.\" \"I came in answer to your letter.\" \"To my letter?\" repeated the editor, puzzled. \"Yes; my name is Chester Rand.\" \"What!\" exclaimed the brown-haired man, almost incredulously. \"You—a boy? How old are you?\" \"Sixteen.\" \"And you are a contributor to Puck and other papers?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You must be a smart boy. Shake hands.\" Chester shook hands with a smile. \"Will my being a boy make any difference?\" he asked. \"Not if your work is satisfactory. Are you willing to work exclusively for The Ph?nix?\" \"Yes, sir; that is, if I may be allowed to complete a contract I have made.\" \"What sort of a contract?\" \"I am illustrating Prof. Hazlitt\u0027s ethnological work. I think it may take me some months more, working evenings.\" \"That won\u0027t interfere with us. I was afraid you might be under an engagement with a rival publication.\" \"No, sir. So far as that goes I will confine myself to The Ph?nix if——\" \"Terms are satisfactory, I suppose.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Then I will agree to pay you twenty-five dollars a week for the first six months. I may be able to do better afterward.\" Chester was dazzled. Twenty-five dollars a week! What would Silas Tripp say to that or his enemy, the bookkeeper. \"I accept,\" he answered, promptly.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81407.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
