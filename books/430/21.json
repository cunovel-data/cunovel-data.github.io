{"id":40456,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. MR. PERKINS MAKES AN ACQUAINTANCE.","content":"Dick Ralston and the bookkeeper stared at their Western friend in undisguised amazement. Finally Mr. Mullins said, \"What did I understand you to call yourself?\" \"Paul Perkins, of Minneapolis.\" \"And—you are staying at the Fifth Avenue Hotel?\" \"Certainly. Didn\u0027t you send this boy with a message?\" said Mr. Perkins, rather impatiently. \"Ye-es.\" \"How did you know that I was coming to New York? That\u0027s what beats me.\" Mullins began to appreciate the situation, and he was cudgeling his brains for an explanation. Finally one came. \"I may be misinformed, but I learned from a friend of yours that you were coming here with an intention of locating in our city. Now, as we are in the real estate business, I thought we would offer our services to find you a suitable house.\" \"Some friend of mine notified you of my coming to New York? Why, I started off on a sudden without consulting anyone. I don\u0027t see how anyone could give you the information.\" \"I won\u0027t undertake to explain it,\" said the bookkeeper. \"I will only say that I am glad to meet you.\" \"Thank you! You are very polite. What was the name of the friend who spoke about me and my plans?\" \"I have a poor memory for names, but I believe I have the gentleman\u0027s card in my desk.\" He opened the desk and made an elaborate search for what he knew he should not find. \"It\u0027s no use,\" he said, after a pause. \"It\u0027s disappeared.\" \"What was the appearance of the person?\" persisted Mr. Perkins. \"He was—tall, and—yes, with a dark complexion and—and side whiskers.\" \"About how old?\" \"I should say about forty.\" \"I know plenty of people answering that description. But how did he happen to call on you?\" \"There you have me. He had some business with Mr. Fairchild, and unfortunately Mr. F. started West this morning.\" \"I see. I can get no clew to the mystery. However, I am glad to have made the acquaintance of this young man,\" indicating Chester. \"Oh, you mean our office boy,\" returned Mullins, coldly. Just then Dick Ralston nudged the bookkeeper. \"Introduce me,\" he said, sotto voce. The bookkeeper did not incline favorably to this request, but did not dare to refuse. Dick Ralston\u0027s appearance was decidedly against him, and his \"loud\" attire was in keeping with his face and manners. \"Mr. Perkins,\" said Mullins, \"allow me to introduce my friend, Mr. Ralston.\" \"Glad to meet you, Mr. Ralston,\" said the man from Minneapolis, extending his hand, which Dick seized and pressed warmly. \"Proud to make your acquaintance, Mr. Perkins,\" rejoined the gambler. \"I always did like Western people.\" \"Thank you. I am not Western by birth, though I went out to Minnesota when I was a mere boy.\" \"And I have no doubt you have prospered,\" said Ralston, who was really anxious to learn whether Mr. Perkins was well provided with money and was worth fleecing. \"Well, I don\u0027t complain,\" answered Perkins, in a matter-of-fact tone. \"I shall be glad to pay you any attentions,\" insinuated Ralston. \"I know the ropes pretty well, and I flatter myself I can show you the town as well as anyone, eh, Mullins?\" \"Oh, yes,\" assented the bookkeeper, not over cordially. \"I have no doubt of it, Mr. Ralston, and I take your offer kindly, but I am afraid I won\u0027t have time to go round much.\" \"Won\u0027t you go out and take a drink? Mullins, you go, too!\" \"Thank you, but I don\u0027t drink—at any rate, when I am away from home. By the way, Mr.——\" and he stopped short, for he did not remember the bookkeeper\u0027s name. \"Mr. Mullins,\" suggested that gentleman. \"You are misinformed about my wanting to locate in this city. New York\u0027s a right smart place, I admit, but give me Minneapolis. That suits me.\" \"All right, sir. I am misinformed, that\u0027s all.\" \"If you find my friend\u0027s card just write and let me know his name. I\u0027d like to know who it is that knows so much about my plans.\" \"I will. Where shall I direct?\" \"Oh, just direct to Minneapolis. I\u0027m well known there. A letter will be sure to reach me.\" \"Shall you be at the hotel this evening, Mr. Perkins?\" added Dick Ralston, who found it hard to give up his design upon his new acquaintance. \"I don\u0027t know. I haven\u0027t made any plans.\" \"I was thinking I might call upon you.\" \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself, Mr. Ralston. Probably you would not find me in.\" Mr. Perkins was a tolerably shrewd man. He had \"sized up\" the gambler, and decided that he did not care to become any better acquainted with him. \"Just as you say,\" returned Dick Ralston, looking discomfited. \"I thought perhaps I could make it pleasant for you.\" \"If I find I have time I can call at your place of business,\" said the man from Minneapolis, with a shrewd glance at the gambler. \"I have no place of business,\" returned Ralston, rather awkwardly. \"I am a—a capitalist, and sometimes speculate in real estate. Don\u0027t I, Mullins?\" \"Of course. By the way, I forgot to tell you that I have four lots on Ninety-sixth Street which would make a good investment.\" \"Ninety-sixth Street! Ahem, rather far uptown. What\u0027s the figure?\" \"Five thousand dollars.\" \"I\u0027ll take a look at them as soon as I have time. You see, Mr. Perkins, I do all my real estate business through my friend, Mr. Mullins.\" \"Just so.\" Neither Mr. Perkins nor Chester was taken in by Ralston\u0027s assumption of the character of a capitalist. The Western man had already a shrewd suspicion of the gambler\u0027s real business, and being a cautious and prudent man, did not care to cultivate him. \"Good-morning!\" said Mr. Perkins. \"I must not take up any more of your time. Will you allow Chester to go out with me for five minutes?\" \"Certainly.\" David Mullins would have liked to refuse, but had no good excuse for doing so. \"Don\u0027t stay long!\" he said, rather sharply. \"I won\u0027t keep him long.\" When they were in the street Mr. Perkins said: \"I don\u0027t like the looks of that bookkeeper of yours.\" \"Nor do I,\" returned Chester. \"I wouldn\u0027t trust him any further than I could see him. Who was that Ralston? Have you ever seen him before?\" \"Once. He doesn\u0027t come into the office when Mr. Fairchild is at home.\" \"Do you know anything about him?\" \"I know—that is, I have heard that he is a well-known gambler.\" \"By the great horn spoon, if I didn\u0027t think so! He seemed very anxious to show me round the city.\" \"He would probably have taken you to a gambling house.\" \"Not if I was in my senses. I don\u0027t gamble, and I hope you don\u0027t.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t know how,\" answered Chester, with a smile. \"Have you any engagement for this evening?\" \"No, sir.\" \"What time do you leave the office?\" \"At five o\u0027clock.\" \"Then come round to the hotel and take dinner with me. I don\u0027t know anyone in the city, and I shall be glad to have your company this evening. We will take a walk together, and you can show me what\u0027s worth seeing.\" \"Are you not afraid that I will take you to a gambling house?\" asked Chester, with a smile. \"I\u0027ll risk it.\" \"You would find Mr. Ralston a better guide.\" \"But not so safe a one. I shall be satisfied with you.\" When Chester returned to the office Mullins asked, sharply: \"What did Perkins want to say to you?\" \"He asked me to dine with him to-night at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.\" \"Speak a good word for me, Chester,\" said Ralston, with unusual affability. \"I would like to become better acquainted with him.\" \"What shall I say, Mr. Ralston?\" \"Tell him I am a prominent man, and expect to be nominated for Congress next fall.\" This he said with a wink. Chester and the bookkeeper laughed. \"I\u0027ll tell him,\" said Chester. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81404.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
