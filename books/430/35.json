{"id":40470,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV. PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY.","content":"No sooner had Chester decided upon his Western journey than he telegraphed to Dean \u0026 Downe, of Tacoma: \"I will call upon you within two weeks.\" Mrs. Rand was much surprised when Chester, coming home unexpectedly, announced his intentions. \"Do you want me to take you with me, mother?\" asked Chester, with a smile. \"I am afraid I could not help you much. But you are not used to traveling. You may take the wrong cars.\" Again Chester smiled. \"I have spent over a year in the city, mother,\" he said. \"I have got along pretty well in the last twelve months, haven\u0027t I?\" \"Yes; but suppose you were to fall sick, with no one to look after you?\" \"I didn\u0027t tell you that I am going to have company. Edward Granger, who was born in Oregon, and is three years older than myself, will go with me.\" \"Then I shall feel easier. He knows the way, and can look after you.\" Chester was secretly of opinion that he was more competent to look after Edward, but did not say so. He saw that his mother was easier in mind, and this relieved him. Before he started from New York he called to see Mr. Fairchild. On Fourteenth Street he fell in with Felix Gordon. \"How are you getting along, Felix?\" he asked. \"Pretty well. Mr. Fairchild has raised me to six dollars a week.\" \"I am glad of it. That shows he is satisfied with you.\" \"I try to please him. I began to think that is the best policy. That is why you have succeeded so well.\" \"Do you ever hear from Mr. Mullins?\" \"No; but I know where he is.\" \"Where? Of course you know that I have no wish to injure him.\" \"He is somewhere in Oregon, or perhaps in Washington Territory.\" Washington had not at that time been advanced to the dignity of a State. \"That is curious.\" \"Why is it curious?\" \"Because I am going to start for Oregon and Washington to-night.\" \"You don\u0027t mean it! What are you going for?\" \"On business,\" answered Chester, not caring to make a confidant of Felix.\" \"Won\u0027t it cost a good deal of money?\" \"Yes; but I expect to get paid for going.\" \"What a lucky fellow you are!\" said Felix, not without a trace of envy. \"I wish I could go. I like to travel, but I have never had a chance.\" Mr. Fairchild was equally surprised when told of Chester\u0027s plans. \"Are you going as an artist?\" he asked. \"No; as a real estate man,\" answered Chester. \"I own a few lots in Tacoma, and have a chance of selling a part of them.\" Then he went into particulars. \"I congratulate you. I have only one piece of advice to offer. Make careful inquiries as to the value of property. Then ask a fair price, not one that is exorbitant. That might drive the hotel people to seeking another site for their house.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Fairchild; I will remember your advice.\" \"The journey is an expensive one. If you need two or three hundred dollars I will loan it to you cheerfully.\" \"Thank you very much, but I have more money saved up than I shall require.\" \"I see you are careful and provident. Well, Chester, I wish you every success.\" \"I am sure of that, Mr. Fairchild. By the way, I hear that your old bookkeeper is in Oregon or Washington.\" \"Who told you?\" \"Felix. Have you any message for him if I happen to meet him?\" \"Say that I have no intention of prosecuting him. If he is ever able I shall be glad to have him return the money he took from me. As to punishment, I am sure he has been punished enough by his enforced flight and sense of wrongdoing.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81418.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
