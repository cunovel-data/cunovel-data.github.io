{"id":40441,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. ROBERT RAMSAY.","content":"Mrs. Rand was as much amazed as Chester himself at his success as an artist. \"How long were you in making the drawing?\" she asked. \"Twenty minutes.\" \"And you received ten dollars. It doesn\u0027t seem possible.\" \"I wish I could work twenty minutes every week at that rate,\" laughed Chester. \"It would pay me better than working for Silas Tripp.\" \"Perhaps you can get some more work of the same kind?\" \"I shall send two more sketches to Mr. Conrad in a day or two. I shall take pains and do my best.\" Two days later Chester sent on the sketches, and then set about trying to find a job of some kind in the village. He heard of only one. An elderly farmer, Job Dexter, offered him a dollar a week and board if he would work for him. He would have eight cows to milk morning and night, the care of the barn, and a multitude of \"chores\" to attend to. \"How much will you give me if I board at home, Mr. Dexter?\" asked Chester. \"I must have you in the house. I can\u0027t have you trapesing home when you ought to be at work.\" \"Then I don\u0027t think I can come, Mr. Dexter. A dollar a week wouldn\u0027t pay me.\" \"A dollar a week and board is good pay for a boy,\" said the farmer. \"It may be for some boys, but not for me.\" Chester reflected that if he worked all day at the farmer\u0027s he could not do any artistic work, and so would lose much more than he made. The sketch sold by Mr. Conrad brought him in as much as he would receive in ten weeks from Farmer Dexter. \"Wyncombe people don\u0027t seem very liberal, mother,\" said Chester. \"I thought Mr. Tripp pretty close, but Job Dexter beats him.\" In the meantime he met Abel Wood carrying groceries to a family in the village. \"Have you got a place yet, Chester?\" he asked. \"No; but I have a chance of one.\" \"Where?\" \"At Farmer Dexter\u0027s.\" \"Don\u0027t you go! I worked for him once.\" \"How did you like it?\" \"It almost killed me. I had to get up at half past four, work till seven in the evening, and all for a dollar a week and board.\" \"Was the board good?\" inquired Chester, curiously. \"It was the poorest livin\u0027 I ever had. Mrs. Dexter don\u0027t know much about cookin\u0027. We had baked beans for dinner three times a week, because they were cheap, and what was left was put on for breakfast the next mornin\u0027.\" \"I like baked beans.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t like them as Mrs. Dexter cooked them, and you wouldn\u0027t want them for six meals a week.\" \"No, I don\u0027t think I should,\" said Chester, smiling. \"How do you get along with Silas Tripp?\" \"He\u0027s always scoldin\u0027; he says I am not half as smart as you.\" \"I am much obliged to Mr. Tripp for his favorable opinion, but he didn\u0027t think enough of me to give me decent pay.\" \"He\u0027s awful mean. He\u0027s talkin\u0027 of reducin\u0027 me to two dollars a week. He says business is very poor, and he isn\u0027t makin\u0027 any money.\" \"I wish you and I were making half as much as he.\" \"There\u0027s one thing I don\u0027t understand, Chester. You ain\u0027t workin\u0027, yet you seem to have money.\" \"How do you know I have?\" \"Mr. Tripp says you came into the store three or four days ago and changed a five-dollar bill.\" \"Yes; Mr. Tripp seemed anxious to know where I got it.\" \"You didn\u0027t use to have five-dollar bills, Chester, when you were at work.\" \"This five-dollar bill dropped down the chimney one fine morning,\" said Chester, laughing. \"I wish one would drop down my chimney. But I must be gettin\u0027 along, or old Tripp will give me hail Columbia when I get back.\" About nine o\u0027clock that evening, as Chester was returning from a lecture in the church, he was accosted by a rough-looking fellow having very much the appearance of a tramp, who seemed somewhat under the influence of liquor. \"I say, boss,\" said the tramp, \"can\u0027t you give a poor man a quarter to help him along?\" \"Are you out of work?\" asked Chester, staying his step. \"Yes; times is hard and work is scarce. I haven\u0027t earned anything for a month.\" \"Where do you come from?\" \"From Pittsburg,\" answered the tramp, with some hesitation. \"What do you work at when you are employed?\" \"I am a machinist. Is there any chance in that line here?\" \"Not in Wyncombe.\" \"That\u0027s what I thought. How about that quarter?\" \"I am out of work myself and quarters are scarce with me.\" \"That\u0027s what you all say! There\u0027s small show for a good, industrious man.\" Chester thought to himself that if the stranger was a good, industrious man he was unfortunate in his appearance. \"I have sympathy for all who are out of work,\" he said. \"Mother and I are poor. When I did work I only got three dollars a week.\" \"Where did you work?\" \"In Mr. Tripp\u0027s store, in the center of the village.\" \"I know. It\u0027s a two-story building, ain\u0027t it, with a piazza?\" \"Yes.\" \"Has the old fellow got money?\" \"Oh, yes; Silas Tripp is rich.\" \"So? He didn\u0027t pay you much wages, though.\" \"No; he feels poor. I dare say he feels poorer than I do.\" \"Such men ought not to have money,\" growled the tramp. \"They\u0027re keepin\u0027 it out of the hands of honest men. What sort of a lookin\u0027 man is this man Tripp? Is he as big as me?\" \"Oh, no, he is a thin, dried-up, little man, who looks as if he hadn\u0027t had a full meal of victuals in his life.\" \"What time does he shut up shop?\" \"About this time,\" answered Chester, rather puzzled by the tramp\u0027s persistence in asking questions. \"What\u0027s your name?\" \"Chester Rand.\" \"Can\u0027t you give me a quarter? I\u0027m awful hungry. I ain\u0027t had a bit to eat since yesterday.\" \"I have no money to give you, but if you will come to our house I\u0027ll give you some supper.\" \"Where do you live?\" \"About five minutes\u0027 walk.\" \"Go ahead, then; I\u0027m with you.\" Mrs. Rand looked up with surprise when the door opened and Chester entered, followed by an ill-looking tramp, whose clothes were redolent of tobacco, and his breath of whisky. \"Mother,\" said Chester, \"this man tells me that he hasn\u0027t had anything to eat since yesterday.\" \"No more I haven\u0027t,\" spoke up the tramp, in a hoarse voice. \"He asked for some money. I could not give him that, but I told him we would give him some supper.\" \"Of course we will,\" said Mrs. Rand, in a tone of sympathy. She did not admire the appearance of her late visitor, but her heart was alive to the appeal of a hungry man. \"Sit down, sir,\" she said, \"and I\u0027ll make some hot tea, and that with some bread and butter and cold meat will refresh you.\" \"Thank you, ma\u0027am, I ain\u0027t overpartial to tea, and my doctor tells me I need whisky. You don\u0027t happen to have any whisky in the house, do you?\" \"This is a temperance house,\" said Chester, \"we never keep whisky.\" \"Well, maybe I can get along with the tea,\" sighed the tramp, in evident disappointment. \"You look strong and healthy,\" observed Mrs. Rand. \"I ain\u0027t, ma\u0027am. Looks is very deceiving. I\u0027ve got a weakness here,\" and he touched the pit of his stomach, \"that calls for strengthenin\u0027 drink. But I\u0027ll be glad of the victuals.\" When the table was spread with an extemporized supper, the unsavory visitor sat down, and did full justice to it. He even drank the tea, though he made up a face and called it \"slops.\" \"Where did you come from, sir?\" asked Mrs. Rand. \"From Chicago, ma\u0027am.\" \"Were you at work there? What is your business?\" \"I\u0027m a blacksmith, ma\u0027am.\" \"I thought you were a machinist and came from Pittsburg,\" interrupted Chester, in surprise. \"I came here by way of Pittsburg,\" answered the tramp, coughing. \"I am machinist, too.\" \"His stories don\u0027t seem to hang together,\" thought Chester. After supper the tramp, who said his name was Robert Ramsay, took out his pipe and began to smoke. If it had not been a cold evening, Mrs. Rand, who disliked tobacco, would have asked him to smoke out of doors, but as it was she tolerated it. Both Chester and his mother feared that their unwelcome visitor would ask to stay all night, and they would not have felt safe with him in the house, but about a quarter past ten he got up and said he must be moving. \"Good-night, and good luck to you!\" said Chester. \"Same to you!\" returned the tramp. \"I wonder where he\u0027s going,\" thought Chester. But when the next morning came he heard news that answered this question. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81389.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
