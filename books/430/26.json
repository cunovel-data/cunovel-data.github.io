{"id":40461,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. A STRANGER IN NEW YORK.","content":"It was not often that Silas Tripp went to New York. The expense was a consideration, and again he found it difficult to leave his business. But he had received a circular from an investment company in Wall Street, offering ten per cent. interest for any money he might have to invest. High interest always attracts men who love money, and it so happened that Silas had five hundred dollars invested. The difference between six and ten per cent. interest on this sum would make twenty dollars annually, besides a contingent share in extra profits promised in the circular, and on the whole he thought it would pay him to make the journey. He went at once to the office of Messrs. Gripp \u0026 Co., on his arrival in the city. He found the financial agents occupying handsome offices, well furnished and covered with a thick Turkey carpet. Everything betokened prosperity, and Mr. Tripp was dazzled. The result was that he made the investment and laid away in his old-fashioned wallet five new bonds, assuring a dividend of ten per cent. \"I calc\u0027late it\u0027s safe,\" he said to Mr. Gripp, a stout man with a florid face, expensively dressed and sporting a large and showy diamond ring. \"Assuredly, my dear sir,\" said Gripp, with suavity. \"I congratulate you, Mr. Tripp, on making an unusually profitable investment. I venture to say that within the year, besides the regular dividend, there will be an extra dividend of five per cent., making fifteen per cent. in all. It is a pity you had not more invested.\" \"Mebby I\u0027ll bring you in some more bimeby,\" said Mr. Tripp, cautiously. \"I trust you will, for your own sake. To us it is not important, as we have plenty of capital offered. Indeed, we have had to limit investments to five thousand dollars for each person. Why, a millionaire, whose name would be very familiar to you if I could venture to mention it, came here last week and wanted to invest fifty thousand dollars in our bonds, but I firmly refused to take more than five thousand.\" \"I don\u0027t see why you should,\" said Silas, puzzled. \"I will tell you why. We wish to give a chance to smaller investors, like yourself, for instance. Rich men have plenty of ways in which to invest their money to advantage, while you probably don\u0027t know where to get over six per cent.\" \"No; I never got more\u0027n that.\" \"I dare say you have considerable invested at that small interest.\" \"Well, mebbe.\" \"Think how much it would be for your advantage to get four per cent. more.\" \"To be sure, sartin! Well, I\u0027ll think of it, Mr. Gripp. Mebbe I\u0027ll come and see you ag\u0027in soon.\" Mr. Gripp smiled to himself. He saw that the bait was likely to prove effective. \"Well, good-by, Mr. Gripp. You\u0027ll send me any information about the bonds?\" \"Yes, Mr. Tripp, with pleasure. Whenever you are in the city, even if you have no business with us, make our office your home. Whenever you have any letters to write, we will furnish you a desk and all facilities.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Gripp; you\u0027re very obleeging.\" So the old man went out, feeling very complacent over his new investment, and much pleased with the handsome way he was treated by Mr. Gripp. \"Lemme see,\" he reflected. \"I\u0027ve got five thousand dollars invested. At ten per cent. it would amount to five hundred dollars, and with an extra dividend of two hundred and fifty dollars more. I\u0027ll have to think it over. All seems safe and square, and Mr. Gripp is a real gentleman.\" Silas Tripp looked at his watch. It was only half-past ten. How should he occupy his spare time? \"I guess I\u0027ll go and see Chester Rand,\" he said. \"His mother told me where he was working. Perhaps he\u0027ll know of some cheap place where I can get dinner. The last time I was in the city it cost me forty cents. That\u0027s a terrible price.\" Mr. Tripp knew the location of Mr. Fairchild\u0027s office, and after some inquiry he found his way there. He felt so much like a stranger in the big city that he anticipated with pleasure seeing a familiar face. Perhaps Chester would invite him out to lunch, and Mr. Tripp, in his frugality, would not have declined the offer even of an office boy, as long as it would save him expense. Felix Gordon was just leaving the office on an errand. \"Is that Mr. Fairchild\u0027s office?\" inquired Silas. \"Yes,\" answered Felix, with rather a disdainful glance at Silas Tripp\u0027s rusty garments. \"Much obleeged to ye,\" said Silas. He entered the office and glanced about, expecting to see Chester. David Mullins came forward, and with some show of civility greeted the old country merchant. Though he was not naturally polite, he knew that the size of a man\u0027s purse could not always be judged from the cut or quality of his garments, and he was just as ready to make money out of Silas as out of any fashionably dressed customer. \"Is Mr. Fairchild in?\" asked Silas. \"No; Mr. Fairchild is out West. I am Mr. Mullins, his bookkeeper, and represent him.\" \"Just so! Have you a boy workin\u0027 for you named Chester—Chester Rand?\" \"Are you a friend of his?\" asked the bookkeeper. \"Well, yes. I come from Wyncombe, where he lives, and I know his folks. I was told he was workin\u0027 here.\" \"Yes, he was working here,\" answered Mullins, emphasizing the past tense. \"Isn\u0027t he here now?\" demanded Silas, with surprise. \"No.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"It\u0027s rather a delicate matter, as you are a friend of his, but some days since I was obliged to discharge him.\" \"You don\u0027t say!\" ejaculated Silas, in manifest surprise. \"I am sorry to say it.\" \"But what was the matter? What did he do?\" \"Well, as to that, he did nothing very serious, but he wasted time when he was sent out on an errand, and I felt that it was injurious to the interests of Mr. Fairchild to retain him.\" \"He used to be spry enough when he worked for me.\" \"When he worked for you?\" \"Yes. I keep a store out in Wyncombe, and he was in my employ most a year. I used to think him quite a lively boy.\" \"I dare say he would do very well in a country store, but in the city we want boys to be active and wide awake. I don\u0027t want to say anything against him. He was perfectly honest, so far as I know.\" \"Has he got another place?\" \"I don\u0027t think he has. It is difficult for a boy to get a place in this city—that is, a good place, and he wouldn\u0027t be likely to refer any employer to me.\" \"I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll be put to it to live, for his mother was poor. How much wages did you pay him?\" \"Five dollars a week.\" \"That\u0027s pretty high pay.\" \"So it is, and we expect a first-class boy for that.\" \"Have you got a better boy in his place?\" \"Yes; I have taken in a cousin of mine who knows my ways and satisfies me.\" \"Was it the boy I saw just after I came in—a dark-complexioned boy with black hair?\" \"Yes, that is Felix.\" \"And you find him better than Chester?\" \"Yes.\" Silas Tripp did not make any comments, but he had not been very favorably impressed by the little he had seen of Chester\u0027s successor. \"Mebbe Chester isn\u0027t adapted to the city,\" Silas said. \"I think you are right. It would be better for him to go back into your store, but country boys fancy they must come to the city and become city business men.\" \"That\u0027s so. Mebbe I wouldn\u0027t succeed in the city myself, though I\u0027m doin\u0027 a tidy business in Wyncombe. I\u0027d like to see Chester. Can you tell me where he lives?\" \"No, I haven\u0027t his address.\" \"I wonder he hasn\u0027t gone back home. Mebbe he hasn\u0027t got the money.\" \"I presume you are correct in your conjecture.\" \"His mother hasn\u0027t said anything to me about Chester bein\u0027 out of work. I\u0027m surprised at that.\" \"Perhaps he did not like to tell her.\" \"Very like, very like! I\u0027m really sorry to hear Chester ain\u0027t done no better.\" \"He isn\u0027t quite up to our mark, but I dare say he will do very well in the country or in some small business.\" \"Are you doin\u0027 a large business? You don\u0027t seem to have much stock here.\" \"My dear sir, we can\u0027t get brownstone houses and country villas into an office like this.\" \"Is that what you sell?\" \"Yes; I sold a fifty-thousand-dollar house this morning up on Forty-fifth Street, and yesterday I sold a summer hotel for forty thousand dollars. Our commission in each case would be several hundred dollars.\" \"Sho! Well, you be doin\u0027 a good business. Can you tell where I can get a good dinner moderate?\" Felix came in at this moment. \"Felix,\" said his cousin, \"you may keep the office while I go out to lunch. Mr. —— You didn\u0027t tell me your name.\" \"Silas Tripp.\" \"Mr. Tripp, it will give me pleasure if you will go out and take lunch with me.\" \"Well, I am sure you\u0027re very polite,\" said Silas, pleased to think he would be saved expense; \"I\u0027m much obliged.\" So the two went out together. Mullins continued to say considerable that was derogatory to Chester, and left Mr. Tripp under the impression that he was a failure so far as New York business was concerned. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81409.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
