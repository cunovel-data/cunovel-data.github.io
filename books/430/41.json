{"id":40476,"no":41,"title":"CHAPTER XLI. CONCLUSION.","content":"Let us go back to Wyncombe. Mrs. Greene, living near Mrs. Rand, was a lady who made it her business to know all about her neighbors\u0027 affairs. She stepped into Silas Tripp\u0027s store to buy a pound of butter. Mr. Tripp himself waited upon her; Mrs. Greene generally had some item of news, and for this he possessed a keen relish. \"Any news, Mrs. Greene?\" he asked, as he handed her the package of butter. \"I suppose you\u0027ve heard that the widder Rand has lost her boarder?\" \"You don\u0027t say so!\" returned Silas, with genuine interest. \"Yes, it\u0027s so. I saw her go off myself yesterday afternoon, bag and baggage.\" \"Was she dissatisfied, do you think?\" \"Like as not. The widder says she\u0027s comin\u0027 back, but I don\u0027t believe it. Between you and me, Mr. Tripp, I wonder that she stayed so long. Now, if she had been boardin\u0027 with you it would have been different.\" \"So it would, Mrs. Greene; so it would. I would have been willing to take her just to oblige.\" \"So would I, Mr. Tripp. The widder charged her a ridiculous price—eight dollars a week.\" \"It was extortionate. I never charged such a price.\" \"Nor I. Miss Dolby\u0027s board ran the house, so that Chester didn\u0027t need to send any home, and now Chester\u0027s lost his place.\" \"You don\u0027t say so!\" ejaculated Silas, eagerly. \"Yes. Mrs. Rand told me herself that he had left his work and gone out West in search of a place. I don\u0027t see, for my part, what the widder\u0027s goin\u0027 to do.\" \"I\u0027m sorry Chester\u0027s been so unlucky. But he needn\u0027t have gone out West; I\u0027m ready to take him back into my store.\" \"That\u0027s very kind of you, Mr. Tripp.\" \"I want to help along his mother, seein\u0027 she\u0027s a widder and in hard luck.\" \"Shall I tell her you will take Chester back?\" \"No; I\u0027ll call round and see her about it. There may be some dickerin\u0027 about the salary. Chester\u0027s got rather high notions, but I can\u0027t afford to pay extravagant prices.\" \"Just so. I\u0027m sorry for the widder Rand, but she\u0027s sot too much on that boy, and thought there wasn\u0027t no other boy in Wyncombe that was equal to him. I\u0027m sure my Fred is just as smart as he.\" It was not till the next evening that Mr. Tripp found it convenient to call on Mrs. Rand. She was rather surprised by the visit, and a little curious to learn what it meant. \"Good-evenin\u0027, widder,\" said Silas, coughing. \"Good-evening, Mr. Tripp. Won\u0027t you step in for a few minutes?\" \"Thank you. I don\u0027t care if I do. I heard yesterday from Mrs. Greene that you\u0027d lost your boarder.\" \"Yes; Miss Dolby has gone to Chicago for a year. She has a sister there.\" \"Do you expect her back?\" \"Yes, after a year.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t calc\u0027late too much upon it if I were you. Women folks is mighty onsartin when they make promises.\" Mrs. Rand smiled. \"You may be right, Mr. Tripp,\" she said. \"I hear, too, that Chester\u0027s lost his place.\" \"No; he has left it for a time, but he expects to go back.\" \"That\u0027s onsartin, too. I\u0027m sorry for you, widder.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Tripp, but there\u0027s no occasion.\" \"You\u0027ll be rather put to it to get along, I reckon.\" \"Still, I have good friends in Wyncombe,\" said Mrs. Rand, smiling mischievously. \"Now, if I were really \u0027put to it,\u0027 I am sure I could rely upon your assistance.\" \"I\u0027m very short of money,\" returned Silas, alarmed at this suggestion. \"Still, I\u0027ve got the will to help you. If Chester\u0027s out of work, I\u0027m ready to take him back into the store.\" \"I will tell him that when I write.\" \"Where is he now?\" \"He\u0027s gone out West.\" \"He\u0027s made a mistake. I knew a boy that went out West some years since, and nearly starved. He came home ragged and hungry.\" \"I am not afraid Chester will have that experience. He had saved up some money when at work in New York.\" \"It won\u0027t last long, widder. It don\u0027t take long for fifty dollars to melt away. Did he have that much?\" \"I think he did, Mr. Tripp.\" \"He\u0027d better have put it in a savings bank and come back to Wyncombe to work for me. How soon do you expect him back?\" \"Next week.\" \"When he comes, send him round to see me.\" A few days later, Mrs. Greene went into Silas Tripp\u0027s store again. \"Well, Mr. Tripp,\" she said, \"Chester Rand\u0027s got home.\" \"You don\u0027t say! If you see him, tell him to come round and see me.\" \"And I can tell you some more news. You know that half-acre lot that j\u0027ins onto the widder\u0027s land?\" \"The apple orchard? Yes.\" \"Well, Chester\u0027s bought it.\" \"You don\u0027t mean it! Where on earth did he get the money? Do you know what he paid?\" \"Two hundred dollars.\" \"He\u0027ll never be able to pay for it.\" \"He has paid cash down. Besides, he\u0027s got a new suit of clothes and a gold watch. I don\u0027t believe he will be willing to take a place in your store.\" Silas Tripp was amazed. Nay, more, he was incredulous. But it so happened that Chester himself came into the store in five minutes, and confirmed the news. \"Where did you get the money, Chester?\" asked Mr. Tripp, curiously, eying the boy with unwonted respect. \"I saved it. I received high pay in New York.\" \"But you\u0027ve lost the place?\" \"Oh, no! I go back to work next week.\" \"How much pay do you get?\" \"Thirty dollars a week.\" \"Don\u0027t try to fool me!\" said Silas, with asperity. \"It ain\u0027t creditable to deceive a man old enough to be your grandfather.\" Chester smiled. \"Do you want me to bring an affidavit from my employers?\" he asked. \"But it\u0027s ridiculous, payin\u0027 a boy such wages!\" objected Silas. \"It would be foolish for you to pay it, Mr. Tripp; but they think me worth it.\" \"What sort of work do you do?\" \"I make pictures. I will show you a couple,\" and Chester produced a copy of The Ph?nix. \"Why, I didn\u0027t think they paid more\u0027n a quarter apiece for such pictures.\" \"It\u0027s lucky for me that they pay higher than that.\" \"What was you doin\u0027 out West?\" \"I went partly to see the country.\" \"I s\u0027pose it cost you considerable money?\" \"Yes, traveling is expensive.\" \"You\u0027d better have put the money in the bank.\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Boys have foolish notions. I s\u0027pose you was sorry to hear that Miss Dolby had gone away?\" \"No, I want mother to have a few months\u0027 rest.\" \"Your mother\u0027ll miss her board.\" \"No, for I shall make it up to her.\" \"You talk as if you was rich, Chester.\" \"I am not so rich as you, Mr. Tripp.\" \"You seem to be spending more money; some day you\u0027ll be put to it to get along.\" But that has not yet come. Two years have passed, and Chester is still in the employ of The Ph?nix, but he now receives forty dollars per week. He has sold his other two lots in Tacoma for five thousand dollars each, and still has the cheaper lots he bought as an investment. He could sell these at a handsome profit, but will hold them a while longer. About a year ago he received intelligence from Edward Granger that his stepfather had died suddenly of heart trouble, brought on by an undue use of alcoholic mixtures. Edward concluded: \"Now there is nothing to mar my mother\u0027s happiness. I live at home and manage her business, besides filling a responsible place in a broker\u0027s office. We hope you will pay us a visit before long. We have never forgotten your kindness to me in my time of need.\" A month since Mr. Fairchild was surprised by receiving a remittance from Tacoma. His old bookkeeper, David Mullins, remitted to him the amount he had stolen at the time of his hurried departure from New York, with interest up to date. \"I hope, Mr. Fairchild,\" he concluded, \"you will now forgive me for my treachery. I feel great satisfaction in paying my debt. I have been assisted by a fortunate investment in outside lots. I am glad to hear that Felix is doing well. You were kind to retain him.\" Felix is really doing well, and bids fair to make a good business man. He was weak and influenced to evil by his cousin; but with good surroundings he is likely to turn out creditably. Chester retains the friendship and good opinion of his first friend, Carl Conrad, and is a favorite visitor at the house of Prof. Hazlitt, whose great work has just appeared from the press of a subscription publisher. His nephew, Arthur Burks, is now in college, and he and Chester remain intimate friends. Silas Tripp has ceased to expect to secure the services of Chester in his store. He had never been able to understand the secret of Chester\u0027s success, but has been heard to remark: \"It does beat all how that boy gets along!\" Fortunately, prosperity has not spoiled Chester. He is still the same modest and warm-hearted boy, or perhaps I should say young man, and his friends all agree that he deserves his success. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81424.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
