{"id":40451,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. PROF. HAZLITT AT HOME.","content":"Chester did not forget his engagement to call upon Prof. Hazlitt on Wednesday evening. He was shown at once into the professor\u0027s study. It was a large room, the sides lined with bookcases crowded with volumes. There seemed to be more books than Chester had ever seen before. In the center of the room was a study table, covered with books, open as if in use. On one side was a desk, at which Prof. Hazlitt himself was seated. \"Good-evening, my young friend,\" he said, cordially, as Chester entered the room. \"You did not forget your appointment.\" \"No, sir. I was not likely to forget such an engagement.\" \"Have you grown to feel at home in the city?\" \"Not entirely, sir, but I am getting a little used to it.\" \"I think you mentioned that you were going into a real estate office?\" \"Yes, sir. I have commenced my duties there.\" \"I hope you find them agreeable.\" \"I might, sir, but that the bookkeeper seems to have taken a dislike to me.\" \"I suspect that you would like better to devote yourself to art work.\" \"I think I should, sir, but Mr. Conrad thinks it better that I should only devote my leisure to drawing.\" \"No doubt his advice is wise, for the present, at least. Now, suppose we come to business. I believe I told you I am writing a book on ethnology.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I find a good deal of help in rare volumes which I consult at the Astor Library. These I cannot borrow, but I have the use of anything I find suited to my needs in the library of Columbia College. Then I import a good many books. I shall spare no pains to make my own work valuable and comprehensive. Of course, I shall feel at liberty to copy and use any illustrations I find in foreign publications. It is here that you can help me.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Here, for instance,\" and the professor opened a French book, \"are some sketches illustrating the dress and appearance of the natives of Madagascar. Do you think you can copy them?\" \"I have no doubt of it, sir,\" he answered. \"Sit down in that chair and try. You will find pencils and drawing paper before you. I will mention one or two particulars in which I want you to deviate from the original.\" Chester sat down and was soon deep in his task. He felt that it was important for him to do his best. He could understand that, though the professor was a kind-hearted man, he would be a strict critic. He therefore worked slowly and carefully, and it was nearly an hour before he raised his head and said: \"I have finished.\" \"Show the sketch to me,\" said the professor. Chester handed it to him. He examined it with critical attention. Gradually his face lighted up with pleasure. \"Admirably done!\" he exclaimed. \"You have carried out my wishes.\" \"Then you are satisfied, sir?\" \"Entirely.\" \"I am very glad,\" said Chester, with an air of relief. He felt now he could do all that was required of him, and, as the contract would pay him two hundred dollars, this success to-night was an important one. \"I won\u0027t ask you to do any more this evening, but I will give you some work to do at home. I believe I agreed to pay you two dollars for each sketch?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Probably you are not over well provided with money, and I will pay you as you go on. Or, rather, I will give you ten dollars as an advance for future work.\" \"Thank you, sir. You are very kind.\" \"Only considerate. I have seen the time when a ten-dollar-bill would have been welcome to me. Now, thanks to a wealthy relative, who left me a fortune, I am amply provided for.\" At this moment the study door opened and a bright-looking boy of about fifteen entered. \"May I come in, uncle?\" he asked, with a smile. \"Yes. Chester, this is my nephew, Arthur Burks. Arthur, this is Chester Rand, a young artist, who is assisting me.\" Arthur came forward and gave Chester his hand cordially. \"You ought to wear spectacles,\" he said, \"like uncle Edgar. You don\u0027t look dignified enough to be his assistant.\" \"That may come in time,\" said Chester, with a smile. \"Arthur, I am done with Chester for this evening,\" said the professor. \"You may carry him off and entertain him. You may bring me the other two sketches whenever you are ready.\" \"Come up to my den,\" said Arthur. \"I have the front room on the third floor.\" As they went upstairs, a prolonged, melancholy shriek rang through the house. Chester stopped short in dismay, and an expression of pain succeeded the gay look on Arthur\u0027s face. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81399.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
