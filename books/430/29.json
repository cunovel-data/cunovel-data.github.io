FAIRCHILD\u0027S TELEGRAM.","content":"\"Tacoma!\" repeated the professor. \"Who is interested in Tacoma?\" \"I own five lots of land there,\" answered Chester. \"Then I congratulate you. Lots are rising there, and are destined to go to a still higher point.\" \"How do you account for that?\" asked Prof. Hazlitt. \"In three months the Northern Pacific Railroad will be completed, and that will give a great impetus to the growth of the town. I expect to live to see fifty thousand people there. Let me ask how you became possessed of these lots?\" \"They were given to me by a friend now dead.\" \"What was his name?\" \"Walter Bruce.\" \"Indeed! Why, I own three lots adjoining the Bruce lots. They are among the best located in the town.\" \"Would you advise me to keep them or sell if I have the chance?\" \"To keep them, by all means. I shall keep mine. If, however, you wish to sell, I will myself pay you five hundred dollars each.\" \"Then I may consider myself worth twenty-five hundred dollars,\" said Chester, in a tone of satisfaction. \"Yes, and more if you are willing to wait.\" \"I think Mr. Bruce only gave twenty-five dollars apiece for them.\" \"Very likely. Mine only cost thirty dollars each.\" \"I shall begin to look upon you as a rich man, Chester,\" said Arthur Burks. \"Only a rich boy,\" corrected Chester, laughing. \"I haven\u0027t begun to shave yet.\" \"I think I shall commence next week,\" remarked Arthur, rubbing his cheek vigorously. \"Since you own property in our neighborhood, Mr. Rand,\" said Prof. Nugent, \"why don\u0027t you make us a visit?\" \"I hope to some day when I can afford it,\" replied Chester, \"but I didn\u0027t know till you told me just now that my lots were worth more than a trifle.\" \"If ever you do come, don\u0027t forget to call on me at the university. It is located in Salem, Oregon. I may be able to take a trip to Tacoma with you.\" \"Thank you, sir. I should like nothing better.\" The next afternoon Chester chanced to enter the Fifth Avenue Hotel. He went through the corridor and into the reading room to buy a paper. What was his surprise to see his recent acquaintance, Paul Perkins, sitting in an armchair, reading a Minneapolis journal. \"Why, Chester!\" exclaimed Mr. Perkins, cordially, as he rose and shook Chester\u0027s hand vigorously. \"It does my heart good to see you. I was intending to call at your office to-morrow.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t have found me, Mr. Perkins.\" \"How is that?\" \"I have been discharged.\" \"By that rascal, Mullins? It\u0027s a shame. I must see if I can\u0027t find you another position.\" \"Thank you, but it is not necessary. I have a place already.\" \"Good! Is it in the real estate business?\" \"No, I am engaged on The Ph?nix, a new weekly humorous paper, as one of the regular staff of artists.\" \"Whew! That is good. Do you get fair pay?\" \"Twenty-five dollars a week.\" \"You don\u0027t say so. That is surprising. How much did you get at the other place?\" \"Five.\" \"Then this is five times as good. You ought to give Mr. Mullins a vote of thanks for bouncing you.\" \"I don\u0027t think he meant to benefit me,\" said Chester, smiling. \"Do you have to work hard? What are your hours?\" \"I have none. I work at home and select my own hours.\" \"Are you through work for the day?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then you must stay and dine with me. It is four o\u0027clock. We can chat for an hour, and then go to dinner.\" \"Thank you. I will accept with pleasure. Did you have a pleasant journey?\" \"Yes; but I should have enjoyed it better if you had been with me. I called at the White House and shook hands with the President.\" \"Did you tell him you wanted an office?\" \"No office for me. I would rather have my own business and be my own master. Washington\u0027s a fine city, but give me Minneapolis.\" \"I may call on you in Minneapolis sometime, Mr. Perkins.\" \"I hope you will. You\u0027ll find it worth visiting. It\u0027s a right smart place, if I do say it.\" \"I have seen a professor from a university in Oregon, and he has given me good news of my lots in Tacoma. I have five, as I think I told you. He offered me five hundred dollars apiece cash down.\" \"Don\u0027t you take it! They\u0027re going a good deal higher, now that the railroad is nearly completed.\" \"So he told me.\" \"I congratulate you on your good luck, Chester. I am sure you deserve it. But you haven\u0027t told me why you were \u0027bounced.\u0027\" \"Mr. Mullins said I wasted time in going his errands. It wasn\u0027t true, but it was only an excuse to get rid of me. He took his cousin Felix in my place.\" The two friends went to dinner about six o\u0027clock. At seven they came downstairs and sat in the lobby on a sofa near the door. Through the portal there was a constant ingress and egress of men—a motley crowd—business men, politicians, professionals and men perhaps of shady character, for a great hotel cannot discriminate, and hundreds pass in and out who are not guests and have no connection with the house. \"It is a wonderful place, Chester,\" said Mr. Perkins. \"Everybody seems at home here. I suppose everybody—everybody, at least, who is presentable—in New York comes here sometime during the year.\" Just then Chester uttered a little exclamation of surprise. As if to emphasize Mr. Perkins\u0027 remark, two persons came in who were very well known to the young artist. They were David Mullins and Dick Ralston. Mullins heard the slight exclamation and turned his head in the direction of the sofa on which Chester and his friend were sitting. So did Ralston. \"Why, it\u0027s your old boy!\" he said. Mullins smiled a little maliciously. He had not heard that Chester had a place. \"I suppose you are boarding here,\" he said, with a little sarcasm. \"No, Mr. Mullins, but I have just dined here—with my friend, Mr. Perkins.\" Mullins inclined his head slightly. \"Has he adopted you?\" he asked, in a tone bordering on impertinence. \"No, sir,\" answered Mr. Perkins; \"but if Chester ever wants me to, I will. At present he is prosperous, and requires no help or adoption.\" \"Oh! Have you got a place?\" asked Mullins, turning to Chester. \"Yes.\" \"In the same business?\" \"No; I am in the office of a weekly paper.\" \"Oh!\" said the bookkeeper, disdainfully. \"They pay beggarly salaries at such places.\" \"Then I am favored. I receive more than twice as much as I did in your office.\" Chester did not care to just state how much he received. \"That can\u0027t be possible!\" \"It is a fact, however. Has Mr. Fairchild returned?\" \"No. Why do you want to know?\" \"I have no wish to go back, Mr. Mullins. Don\u0027t be apprehensive of that. I don\u0027t wish to disturb Felix.\" Dick Ralston listened with some interest to the conversation. \"It strikes me the kid has come to no harm from being discharged,\" he said. \"I believe this is Mr. Perkins, of Minneapolis?\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered the Westerner, eying the gambler with a penetrating glance. \"I shall be glad to be your guide if you wish to see something of New York. Will you join us this evening?\" \"You are very polite, but I have an engagement with Chester.\" \"A mere boy! He knows nothing about the city.\" \"Still I am satisfied with him.\" The two passed on and went into the bar-room, where they sat down at a table and ordered some liquid refreshment. \"Well, Mullins,\" said the gambler, \"I am getting impatient. The days are slipping by, and you have done nothing.\" \"You know what I am waiting for. Yesterday a check for a thousand dollars was paid in at the office, and deposited in the bank to-day.\" \"Good! And then?\" \"I will send Felix to the bank and draw out sixteen hundred. Will that satisfy you?\" \"I see, and, according to our arrangement, Felix will hand it to me on his way back to the office, and then swear that it was taken from him by some unknown party. You have coached him, have you?\" \"Yes. Of course, I had to let him into the secret partially, promising him twenty-five dollars for himself.\" \"Ten would have been sufficient.\" \"He would not have been satisfied. We can spare that.\" \"How soon do you expect Fairchild back?\" \"In three days.\" But on the morrow Mullins was disconcerted by receiving the following telegram: \"Expect me back sometime to-day. Fairchild.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959/81412.html","bookId":430,"book":{"id":430,"title":"Chester Rand or The New Path to Fortune","description":"简介： Probably the best known citizen of Wyncombe, a small town nestling among the Pennsylvania mountains, was Silas Tripp. He kept the village store, occasionally entertained travelers, having three spare rooms, was town treasurer, and conspicuous in othe...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2959","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
