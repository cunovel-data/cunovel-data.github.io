Which is why her attraction to former Navy SEAL Maxwell Ackerman doesn’t make a lot of sense. There isn’t a submissive bone in his muscular body, suggesting her interest in the man is best indulged as a private fantasy. When a crisis situation reveals different sides of them both, the attraction becomes mutual and undeniable. Janet and Max take the plunge, willing to see if the give-and-take of their unexpected relationship can satisfy their deepest desires. Until ghosts from their past emerge, threatening to destroy the delicate balance of power before their love can find a way to tip the scales.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/willing-sacrifice-knights-of-the-board-room-6.jpg","author":"Joey W.
