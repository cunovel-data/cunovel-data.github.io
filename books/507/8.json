BROTHER TERRAPIN’S FIDDLE-STRING.","content":"Mr. Rabbit moved his body uneasily about, and scratched his head, and crossed and uncrossed his legs several times before he began. “I declare it isn’t right!” he exclaimed after a while. “I don’t mind telling about other folks, but when it comes to talking about myself, it is a different thing.” “Don’t you remember the time you tried to get Brother Terrapin to give you a fiddle-string?” asked Mrs. Meadows, laughing a little. “Oh, that was just a joke,” replied Mr. Rabbit. “Call it a joke, then,” said Mrs. Meadows. “You know what the little boy said when the man asked him his name. He said, says he, ‘You may call it anything, so you call me to dinner.’” “He wasn’t very polite,” remarked Sweetest Susan. [Pg 102] “No, indeed,” Mrs. Meadows answered; “but you know that little boys can’t always remember to be polite.” “I think we were at your house,” suggested Mr. Rabbit, rubbing his chin. “Yes,” replied Mrs. Meadows. “In the little house by the creek. The yard sloped from the front door right to the bank.” “To be sure,” exclaimed Mr. Rabbit, brightening up. “I remember the house just as well as if I had seen it yesterday. There was a little shelf on the left-hand side of the door as you came out, and there the water-bucket sat.” “Yes,” said Mrs. Meadows; “and there was just room enough up there by the bucket for Brother Terrapin.” “That’s so,” Mr. Rabbit replied, laughing, “and when he used to go to your house to see the girls they’d set the bucket on the table in the house and lift Brother Terrapin to the shelf so he could see and be seen. I remember it used to make him very mad when I’d tell him he would be a mighty man if he wasn’t so flat-footed.” “Oh, you used to talk worse than that,” cried Mrs. Meadows, laughing heartily at the remembrance [Pg 103] of it. “You used to tell him he was the only man you ever saw that sat down when he stood up. I declare! Brother Terrapin’s eyes used to get right red.” “Well,” said Mr. Rabbit, after a pause; “I remember I went to your house one day and I carried my fiddle. When I got there, who should I see but old Brother Terrapin sitting up on the shelf. I expected to find the girls by themselves, but there was Brother Terrapin. So I began to joke him. “‘Howdy, Brother Terrapin?’ says I. ‘If you had a ladder handy you could come downstairs and shake hands, couldn’t you?’ “He began to get sullen and sulky at once. He wouldn’t hardly make any reply. But I didn’t care for that. Says I: ‘Cross your legs and look comfortable, Brother Terrapin; don’t be glum in company. I’ve got my fiddle with me, and I’m going to make your bones ache if you don’t dance.’ “Then I whirled in,” said Mr. Rabbit, “and played the liveliest tunes I could think of,—‘Billy in the Low Grounds,’ ‘’Possum up the Gum-Stump,’ ‘Chicken in the Bread-Tray,’ and [Pg 104] all those hoppery-skippery, jiggery-dancery tunes that make your feet go whether or no. But there Brother Terrapin sat, looking as unconcerned as if the fiddle had been ten miles away. He didn’t even keep time to the music with his foot. More than that, he didn’t even wag his head from side to side.” “I always knew Brother Terrapin had no ear for music,” remarked Mrs. Meadows. “If that was a fault, he certainly had more than his share of it.” “I ought not to talk about people behind their backs,” Mr. Rabbit continued, trying to shake a fly out of his ear, “but I must say that Brother Terrapin was very dull about some things. Well, I played and played, and the girls danced and seemed to enjoy it. I believe you danced a round or two yourself?” Mr. Rabbit turned to Mrs. Meadows inquiringly. “I expect I shook my foot a little,” said Mrs. Meadows with a sigh. “I was none too good.” “They danced and danced until they were tired of dancing,” Mr. Rabbit resumed; “but there sat Brother Terrapin as quiet as if he were asleep. Well, I was vexed—I don’t mind saying [Pg 105] so now—I was certainly vexed. But I didn’t let on. And between tunes I did my best to worry Brother Terrapin. MR. RABBIT FIDDLING FOR BROTHER TERRAPIN “‘Ladies,’ says I, ‘don’t make so much fuss. Let Brother Terrapin get his nap out. You’ll turn a chair over directly, and Brother Terrapin will give a jump and fall off the shelf and break some of the furniture in his house.’ This made the girls laugh very much, for they remembered the old saying that Brother Terrapin carries his house on his back. ‘Don’t laugh so loud,’ says I, ‘Brother Terrapin has earned his rest. He’s been courting on the other side of the creek, and he has no carriage to ride in when he goes back and forth. Sh-h!’ says I, ‘don’t disturb him. When a person sits down when he stands up, and lies down when he walks, some allowance must be made.’ “Brother Terrapin’s eyes grew redder and redder, and the skin on the back of his head began to work backward and forward. What might have happened I don’t know, but just as the girls were in the middle of a dance one of my fiddle-strings broke, and it was the treble, too. I wouldn’t have minded it if it had been any of [Pg 106] the other strings, but when the treble broke I had to stop playing. “Well, the girls were very much disappointed and so was I, for I had come for a frolic. I searched in my pockets, but I had no other string. I tried to play with three strings, but the tune wouldn’t come. The girls were so sorry they didn’t know what to do. “Just then an idea struck me. ‘Ladies,’ says I, ‘it’s a thousand pities I didn’t bring an extra treble, and I’m perfectly willing to go home and fetch one, but if Brother Terrapin was a little more accommodating the music could go right on. You could be dancing again in a little or no time.’ “‘Oh, is that so?’ says the girls. ‘Well, we know Brother Terrapin will oblige us.’ “‘I’m not so sure of that,’ says I. “‘What do you want me to do?’ says he. His voice sounded as if he had the croup. “‘Ladies,’ says I, ‘you may believe it or not, but if Brother Terrapin has a mind to he can lend me a treble string that will just fit my fiddle.’ “‘Brother Rabbit,’ says he, ‘you know I have no fiddle-string. What would I be doing with one?’ [Pg 107] “‘Don’t mind him, ladies. He knows just as well as I do that he has a fiddle-string in his neck. I can take my pocket-knife and get it out in half a minute,’ says I. “This made Brother Terrapin roll his eyes. “‘Be ashamed of yourself, Brother Terrapin,’ says the girls. ‘And we were having so much fun, too.’ “‘If my neck was as long and as tough as Brother Terrapin’s, I’d take one of the leaders out and make a fiddle-string of it, just to oblige the ladies,’ says I. “The girls turned up their noses and tossed their heads. ‘Don’t pester Brother Terrapin,’ says they. ‘We’ll not ask him any more.’ “‘Ladies,’ says I, ‘there is a way to get the fiddle-string without asking for it. Will you please hand me a case-knife out of the cupboard there?’ “I rose from my chair with a sort of a frown,” continued Mr. Rabbit, laughing heartily, “but before I could lift my hand Brother Terrapin rolled from the shelf and went tumbling down the slope to the creek, heels over head.” “Did it hurt him much?” asked Sweetest Susan, with a touch of sympathy. [Pg 108] “It didn’t stop his tongue,” replied Mr. Rabbit. “He crawled out on the other side of the creek and said very bad words. He even went so far as to call me out of my name. But it is all over with now,” said Mr. Rabbit, with a sigh. “I bear no grudges. Let bygones be bygones.” “I never heard before that Brother Terrapin had a fiddle-string in his neck,” said Buster John, after he had thought the matter over a little. “In dem times,” said Drusilla, as if to satisfy her own mind, “you couldn’t tell what nobody had skacely.” “Why, as to that,” replied Mr. Rabbit, “the fiddle-string in his neck was news to Brother Terrapin.” There was a pause here and the children seemed to be somewhat listless. “I’ll tell you what I think,” remarked Mrs. Meadows to Mr. Rabbit; “these children here are lonesome, and they’ll be getting homesick long before the time comes for them to go. Oh, don’t tell me!” she cried, when the children would have protested. “I know how I’d feel if I was away from home in a strange country and had nobody but queer people to talk to. We are [Pg 109] too old. Even Chickamy Crany Crow and Tickle-My-Toes are too old, and Mr. Thimblefinger is too little.” BROTHER TERRAPIN TUMBLING INTO THE CREEK “Well, what are we going to do about it?” asked Mr. Rabbit, running his thumb in the bowl of his pipe. “I was just thinking,” responded Mrs. Meadows. “Hadn’t we better bring out the Looking-Glass family?” “Well,” said Mr. Rabbit, “I leave that to you.” To hide the smile that gathered around his mouth Mr. Rabbit leaned his head over and scratched his left ear lazily with his left foot. “That’s what I’ll do,” Mrs. Meadows declared decisively. “These children want company they can appreciate, poor things!” She went into the house, and presently came out again, bringing a mirror about three feet wide and five feet high.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2804/77529.html","bookId":507,"book":{"id":507,"title":"Little Mr. Thimblefinger and His Queer Country","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a plantation, in the very middle of Middle Georgia, a little girl and a little boy and their negro nurse.
