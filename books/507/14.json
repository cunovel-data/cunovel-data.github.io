{"id":19879,"no":14,"title":"XIV. THE WITCH OF THE WELL.","content":"While Mr. Thimblefinger was telling the story of the Strawberry-Girl, Chickamy Crany Crow and Tickle-My-Toes had drawn near to listen. Chickamy Crany Crow stood near Mrs. Meadows, and seemed to be very much interested. When Mr. Thimblefinger had concluded, she would have gone away, but Mrs. Meadows detained her. “No,” said Mrs. Meadows, as Chickamy Crany Crow tried to pull her hand away; “you must stay right here and tell the children the story of the Witch of the Well.” “They know it already,” said Chickamy Crany Crow, trying to hide behind Mrs. Meadows’s chair. “No, we don’t,” exclaimed Buster John. “We know the old rhyme about “‘Chickamy, Chickamy Crany Crow, Went to the well to wash her toe, And when she came back her chicken was gone.’ [Pg 156] That’s the rhyme we say in the game, but we never heard the story.” “I can’t tell it to so many,” said Chickamy Crany Crow. “Well, tell it to me, then,” replied Mrs. Meadows coaxingly. “The rest won’t listen any more than they can help.” “Well,” said Chickamy Crany Crow, “one time there was an old woman that lived near a well. For a long time nobody thought she was a witch, but after a while people began to have their suspicions. There was a quagmire in the road right in front of the old woman’s house, and every traveler passing that way was sure to get mud on his feet. No matter whether he was riding horseback or in a buggy, it was all the same. He was sure to get his feet muddy. And the mud was so black, and thick, and heavy, that he was anxious to get it off as soon as possible. “It happened, too, that every time a traveler crossed the quagmire, after getting the black, heavy mud on his feet, the old woman would be sitting in her door smoking a cob pipe. “‘Howdy, dearie!’ she would say. ‘Why, [Pg 157] you’re full of nasty mud! Go to the well yonder, dearie, and wash it off.’ “The traveler would leave his buggy and horse, or his horse and saddle, or his bundle at the old witch’s door, and go to the well to wash his feet. When he came back everything would be gone,—witch, horse, buggy, saddle, or bundle. The quagmire would be dried up, and the road itself would seem to be a different road. Sometimes it would be days and days before the traveler could find his way to the place where he started. “One day a traveler came along the road in a fine carriage. With him he had a beautiful little girl with long golden hair. She had eyes as blue and as clear as the water in the spring when the sunshine slants through, and her skin was as white as milk. When the carriage had crossed the quagmire, the traveler found that his feet were covered with the black, heavy mud. He couldn’t imagine how it had happened. There was no hole in the bottom of the carriage, the door was shut tight, and there was no way for the mud to get in. He said to the little girl:— “‘Daughter, are your feet muddy?’ “‘Not a bit, father.’ [Pg 158] “When the carriage crossed the quagmire, there sat the old woman in the door. “‘Howdy, dearie!’ says she. ‘And how did you get the nasty mud on your feet? Yonder is a well; leave your carriage here and go wash it off.’ “So the traveler kissed his daughter, for he was very fond of her, and went to the well to wash his feet. When he came back, daughter, carriage, and old woman had all disappeared. He wandered around like a crazy man for many days, and at last came to where my mother lived and told his story. This wasn’t the first time she had heard such a tale, and she concluded to see what the matter was. So she called me and gave me a black chicken and told me to go by the old woman’s house and see what happened. “I took the chicken, which was tied by the legs, and went along the road until I came to the quagmire. I tried to pick my way around it, but the black mud bubbled up and flew at my feet, and finally it became so thick and heavy I could scarcely walk. When I got across, there sat the old woman smoking her cob pipe and grinning. “‘Howdy, dearie!’ says she. [Pg 159] “‘Howdy, granny!’ says I. “‘Leave your fat chicken here,’ says she, ‘and go to yonder well and wash your toe.’ “‘Thanky, granny; that I will,’ says I. “So I went to the well, but when I came back my chicken was gone. And so was the old woman, and the quagmire. But I didn’t get frightened. I went back to the well and began to sing,— “‘Chickamy, Chickamy Crany Crow, I went to the well to wash my toe, But when I came back my chicken was gone— What o’clock, old witch?’ “I hadn’t been there long before the mud began to bubble up again, and out of it came the old witch. And then what seemed to be a thick mist cleared away, and there was the old witch’s house, and inside I could see the beautiful little girl crying for her father. I intended to run home and tell what I had seen, but before I could move out of my tracks I heard the old woman coming to the well. In coming up out of the quagmire she had got mud on her feet. She had pulled off her shoes for comfort, and had been going about in her stocking-feet, and of course when [Pg 160] she disappeared in the quagmire, and came up through it again, her stockings were full of mud; and so she came to the well to wash them. “I didn’t know whether to run or stay, but I stayed, and as soon as the old woman got in sight, I sat on the ground and began to rock my body backwards and forwards, crying,— “‘Oh, mercy me! Oh, what shall I do? I can’t get the black mud off of my shoe!’ “The old woman seemed to be very angry when she first saw me, but I pretended to pay no attention to her. I just rocked backwards and forwards, and cried that I couldn’t get the black mud off of my shoe. The old woman sat down and pulled off her stockings, and began to wash them. When she had finished one, she threw it behind her on the grass to dry. Being wet and heavy it fell farther from her hand than she intended. It fell close to me, and I picked it up and stuffed it in my pocket.” “What for?” asked Buster John bluntly. “Well, I hardly know,” replied Chickamy Crany Crow, somewhat embarrassed at the suddenness of the question. “I wanted to get even [Pg 161] with her for stealing my fat chicken. I hardly knew what I was doing, and I certainly didn’t know how it would turn out. Well, I stuffed the old woman’s wet stocking in my pocket, and kept on crying out that I didn’t know how to get the black mud off of my shoe. “‘Do as I do,’ said the old woman. Then I went and sat on the grass in front of her, and washed the mud from my shoe. “For the first time I saw what a horrible-looking creature the old woman was. Her eyes were sunk in her head, her nose was hooked over her mouth, and she had two long upper teeth that hung lower than her under lip. I says to myself, ‘Well, old lady, if you are not a witch, there never was one.’ She washed her stocking, mumbling and chewing, and when she had finished she threw it behind her, and sat hugging her knees, and glaring at me in a way that made my flesh crawl. “‘What is your name?’ says she. “‘Chickamy Crany Crow,’ says I. “‘What are you doing here?’ says she. “Says I, ‘I went to the well to wash my toe, but when I came back my chicken was gone.’ [Pg 162] “Then the old woman began to laugh like a cackling hen, and she laughed so loud and laughed so long that it scared me. I got up and pretended to be going home, but when I had gone a little way I hid behind a big tree, and watched the old woman’s antics. She kept on laughing for some time, and then she reached out for her stockings. She found the only one she had left, and put it on. Then she reached around for the other, but failed to find it, because I had it in my pocket. This seemed to puzzle her. She stood up and looked all around for her missing stocking, but it wasn’t there. Then she sat down again, pulled off the stocking she had on, and put it on the other foot. “But she still lacked a stocking. This seemed to puzzle the old witch worse than ever. Once more she pulled off the stocking and put it on the other foot, and appeared to be very much astonished because one foot was still bare.” “She couldn’t ’a’ had much sense!” exclaimed Drusilla. “Not about stockings and things like that,” said Chickamy Crany Crow. “Well, she sat there, pulling the stocking from one foot and [Pg 163] putting it on the other, until she seemed to forget about everything else. I watched her until I got tired, and then I thought I would take her missing stocking and throw it in the quagmire. “The moment I did this, the quagmire began to bubble, and hiss, and roll, and toss and tumble about, and soon it disappeared altogether. A little fog arose when the quagmire sank out of sight, and when this cleared away, there stood the carriage that had brought the beautiful little girl with the golden hair, and the little girl herself was sitting in it, ready to go to her father. But this wasn’t all. All around, there were numbers of horses and buggies, and all sorts of bundles and money-purses, and everything that travelers carry along with them. “Well, I got in the carriage with the beautiful little girl, clucked to the horses, and drove to my mother’s house. All the horses with saddles, and all the horses hitched to buggies, followed along after us, and there was great rejoicing among the people as we went by.” “What became of the old witch?” asked Buster John. “She stayed there, trying to make one stocking [Pg 164] do for two feet, until the well dried up, and after that I don’t know what became of her.” “You ought to have been a young man,” said Sweetest Susan, who had been reading fairy stories, “so that you could have married the beautiful girl with golden hair, after rescuing her. Besides, your name would have been in the books.” “Oh,” answered Chickamy Crany Crow, smiling for the first time, “there are plenty of names in the books that you never hear of; but now, wherever little children get together to play games, you will hear them saying the rhyme that tells a part of my story,— “‘Chickamy, Chickamy Crany Crow, Went to the well to wash her toe, But when she got back her chicken was gone.’”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2804/77535.html","bookId":507,"book":{"id":507,"title":"Little Mr. Thimblefinger and His Queer Country","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a plantation, in the very middle of Middle Georgia, a little girl and a little boy and their negro nurse.
