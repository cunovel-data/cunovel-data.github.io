When they saw the children sitting at the table they both stopped suddenly. The queer-looking girl turned and made a wry face at the very queer-looking boy. At this both burst out laughing, and suddenly stopped again. “Be ashamed of yourselves!” exclaimed old Mr. Rabbit, rapping on the floor with his cane. “Be ashamed! Where are your manners? Go and speak to our friends and make your best bow, too,—don’t forget that!” Mr. Rabbit appeared to be very indignant. Mrs. Meadows was in a better humor. “This,” she said, as the queer-looking girl came forward, “is Chickamy Crany Crow, and this,” as the very queer-looking boy came timidly up, “is Tickle-My-Toes.” They bowed, and then went off a little way, [Pg 74] looking very solemn and comical. They didn’t dare glance at each other for fear they would begin laughing again. The reason they looked so queer was because, although they acted like children, they were old in appearance,—as old as a person past middle age. “They are country-raised, poor things! You’ll have to excuse them. They don’t know any better.” Mr. Thimblefinger sighed as he said this, and looked thoughtful. “What about the Talking-Saddle?” Buster John inquired. “You said the story wasn’t finished.” “To be sure! To be sure!” Mr. Thimblefinger cried. “My mind is like a wagon without a tongue. It goes every way but the right way. Where was I? Oh, yes, I remember now.” “Well, the Mayor was very thankful to Tip-Top for saving his treasure and his horses, but he wasn’t satisfied about the saddle. He was worried. Now, you know when a child is worried it cries, but when a grown man is worried he sits down and looks away off, and puts his elbow in his hand and his finger to his nose—so.” “Oh, I’ve seen papa do that,” laughed Sweetest Susan. [Pg 75] “Yes, that’s the way the Mayor did,” Mr. Thimblefinger continued. “There was a great thief in that country who had never been caught. He didn’t care for judges and juries and courthouses. He always sent the Mayor word when he was coming to the city and when he was going away. “Now, the Mayor had received a letter from this man just the day before Tip-Top came. The thief said he was coming after a fine race-horse that was owned by the Mayor’s brother. So the Mayor sat and thought, and finally he asked Tip-Top if his Talking-Saddle could catch a famous thief. “‘It has just caught four common rogues, your honor,’ replied Tip-Top, ‘and I think it can catch one uncommon thief.’ “Then the Mayor told Tip-Top that the most famous thief in all that country intended to steal his brother’s race-horse. Tip-Top said he must see the horse, and together they went to the stable where it was kept. The horse was already guarded. Two servants sat in the stall, two sat outside, and two remained near the door. The Mayor’s brother was also there. [Pg 76] “‘What is this?’ the brother asked. “‘This fellow wants to sell his saddle,’ replied the Mayor. “‘Then arrest him,’ cried the brother, ‘for he is the thief.’ “‘Nonsense,’ replied the Mayor. ‘He is a very honest man and I will vouch for him.’ “Then the Mayor called his brother aside and told him why the man with the saddle had come to see the horse. “Tip-Top talked with the men who had been set to guard the horse, and he soon found that one of them was an accomplice of the thief. This man made a swift sign to Tip-Top, and placed his finger on his mouth. Tip-Top replied by closing his eyes with his fingers, as if to show that he saw nothing. When he had an opportunity he said to this man:— “‘Tell your master I will be willing to sell the saddle to-night. I will sleep with it under my head on the next corner. It is worth one thousand pieces of gold.’ “Then he returned to the Mayor, and they went away. Tip-Top laughed as they walked along. ‘This thief,’ he remarked, ‘is a fool. [Pg 77] It is so easy to steal a horse that he will not buy a saddle. He will try to steal mine. Then we shall catch him. He will get the horse—’ “‘What!’ cried the Mayor; ‘get the horse?’ “‘Certainly; nothing is easier,’ replied Tip-Top. ‘He will get the horse, and then he will want a saddle. He will be passing the wall here. He will see me sleeping with my head on my friend and then he will attempt to steal it, but the surcingle will be buckled around my body, and I will awake and cry blue murder. Then you and your brother can come forward from the vacant house yonder and seize him.’ “‘Where did you learn all this?’ asked the Mayor. He began to suspect that his brother was right when he said that Tip-Top was the thief. “‘My saddle told me,’ Tip-Top answered. “‘Well,’ said the Mayor, ‘your plan is as good as any, but how will the thief get the horse that is so well guarded?’ “‘Ah!’ Tip-Top exclaimed, ‘if I were to tell you, we should never catch the thief.’ “So it was all arranged. Tip-Top was to sleep on his Talking-Saddle, near the wall and the [Pg 78] Mayor and his brother were to watch from the windows of the vacant house opposite. “When night came, the watchers who had been set to guard the horse were very anxious. They were ready to arrest any one who might chance to enter. Whenever they heard footsteps approaching they seized their clubs and stood on the defensive. Sometimes a passer-by would pause, look in, and ask what the trouble was. Then the watchers would reply that they were waiting for the great thief who was coming to steal the fine horse. Thus the hours passed, but no thief came. Then the watchers began to get tired. “‘We are crazy,’ said one. ‘How can a thief steal this horse, even if he were to come in here? We are four to one. Two of us should sleep a while, and thus we can take turns in watching.’ This was agreed to, and two of the guards stretched themselves on the straw and prepared to sleep. But just then they heard some one singing far down the street. It was a jolly song, and the sound of it came louder and louder. As the singer was going by, the light in the stable caught his eye, and he paused and looked in, but still kept up his singing. [Pg 79] “‘Friends,’ he said when his song was done, ‘what is the trouble?’ “‘We are watching a horse.’ “‘Is he sick? Perhaps I can aid you. I have doctored many a horse in my day.’ “‘He is not sick,’ replied the watchers. ‘He is well and taking his ease. We are watching to prevent a thief from stealing him.’ “Then they told him the threat the thief had made. “‘Come, that is too good,’ cried the newcomer. ‘This thief will be worth looking at when four such stout lads as you get through with him. When does he show himself?’ “‘That is what we are to find out,’ replied the watchers. “‘Very well,’ the newcomer said; ‘I’ll stay, by your permission, and see you double him up.’ “The watchers gave their consent gladly, for the newcomer had a lively manner and a rattling tongue. He sang songs and told stories for an hour or more, and then pulled a bottle from under his coat. “‘A little wine,’ he said, ‘will clear the fog from our throats.’ He passed the bottle around, [Pg 80] and all drank except the guard who was watching in the stall. “Now the man who had come singing up the street was the thief himself, and the guard in the stall was his companion. The wine was drugged, and in a very few minutes three of the watchers were fast asleep. Then the thief and his companion took the horse from the stall. “‘I shall have to remain here and pretend to be asleep,’ said the companion. ‘You will find a saddle around the corner.’ He then told the thief about the man with the saddle. “‘You are a fool, my friend,’ said the thief. ‘It is a trick—a trap.’ “But when he had carried off the horse and hid it at the house of an acquaintance, the thought of the man with the saddle worried him so that he went back to satisfy himself. Tip-Top and his saddle were there, and Tip-Top had slept so soundly that his head had rolled from his pillow. The thief thought it would be a good stroke of business to take the saddle along, but when he tried to lift it, Tip-Top awoke and seized him, and cried ‘Murder!’ at the top of his voice. “The Mayor and his brother rushed from [Pg 81] their place of concealment, and soon the thief was bound. “‘Where is the horse?’ cried the Mayor. “‘What horse?’ exclaimed the thief. ‘Do you think I carry horses in my pocket?’ “‘What were you doing here, then?’ “‘This fellow’s head had slipped from its pillow, and when I tried to put it back he seized me and yelled that I was murdering him! I saw no horse under the saddle.’ “‘Wait here a little,’ said Tip-Top. ‘Hold this thief till I return.’ “He went to the stable, woke the thief’s accomplice, who by this time was really asleep, and told him his companion had been captured. ‘If I can find the horse and hide it our friend will be safe, for nothing can be proved on him.’ “The man was so frightened that he told Tip-Top where he had arranged to meet the thief the next day. Then Tip-Top returned to the Mayor and his brother, who still held the thief, and took them to the house where the horse had been stabled. “When the horse had been found and restored to its owner the Mayor said to Tip-Top [Pg 82] that he would not only reward him handsomely but grant any request he might make. “‘Then, your honor,’ replied Tip-Top, ‘give this man his liberty.’ “‘Why?’ asked the Mayor, much astonished. “‘Because, your honor, he is my brother.’ “The thief was as much astonished as the Mayor at this turn in his affairs, but he had no difficulty in recognizing Tip-Top as his younger brother. “‘He certainly is a man of talent,’ said the Mayor, ‘and it is a pity that he should be executed.’ “Then the thief fell on his knees and begged the Mayor to pardon him, promising him to live and die an honest man. And he kept his promise. He engaged in business, and, aided by Tip-Top’s advice and influence, made a large fortune.” “What became of the Talking-Saddle?” asked Buster John. “Well,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger, “Tip-Top hung the saddle in his front porch, as you have seen farmers do. He thought a great deal of it.” THE MAYOR PARDONING THE THIEF [Pg 83] “I’ve read something about the great thief,” remarked Buster John. “But the story didn’t end that way. The thief escaped every time.” “Oh, well, you know how some people are,” exclaimed Mrs. Meadows. “They want everything to happen just so; even a thief must be a big man if he’s in a story; but I don’t believe anybody ever stole anything yet without getting into trouble about it.” “Who is that crying?” Mr. Rabbit suddenly exclaimed. “I hear no crying,” said Mrs. Meadows. “I certainly thought I heard crying,” persisted Mr. Rabbit. “It is Chickamy Crany Crow and Tickle-My-Toes singing. Listen!” Sure enough the queer-looking boy and the queer-looking girl were singing a song. One sang one line and the other the next line, and this made the song somewhat comical. The words were something like these:— CHICKAMY CRANY CROW. Oh sing it slow, This song of woe, Of the girl who went to wash her toe! [Pg 84] Her name was Chick— (Oh run here quick— The word’s so thick)— Chickamy—Chickamy Crany Crow! Chickamy what? and Chickamy which? She went to the well and fell in the ditch; What o’clock, old Witch? The clock struck one And bowed to the sun; But the sun was fast asleep you know; And the moon was quick, With her oldtime trick— To hide from Chick— Chickamy—Chickamy Crany Crow! Chickamy what? and Chickamy which? She went to the well and fell in the ditch; What o’clock, old Witch? Oh, sad to tell! She went to the well— The time was as close to eve as to dawn— To Chickamy Chick, So supple and slick, The clock said “Tick!” But when she came back her chicken was gone! Oh, whatamy, whichamy, chickamy, oh! Moonery, oonery, tickamy Toe! Wellery, tellery, gittery go! Witchery, itchery, knitchery know. CHICKAMY CRANY CROW AND TICKLE-MY-TOES [Pg 85] “What kinder gwines on is dat?” exclaimed Drusilla, whose mind had never been quite easy since she walked through the dry water in the spring without getting drowned. “We all better be makin’ our way to’rds home. Time we git dar—ef we ever is ter git dar—it’ll be dark good. Den what yo’ ma gwine to say? She gwine ter talk wid de flat er her han’—dat what she gwine ter talk wid. Come on!” “Can’t you be quiet?” cried Buster John. “It’s nothing but a song.” “Oh, you kin stay, an’ I’ll stay wid you,” said Drusilla; “but when Mistiss git you in de wash-room, don’t you come sayin’ dat I wouldn’t fetch you home.” “I want to see everything,” said Buster John. “I done seed much ez I want ter see,” replied Drusilla, “an’ now I want ter live ter tell it.” Before Buster John could say anything more, everything suddenly grew a little darker, and in the middle of the sky—or what ought to have been the sky, but which was the enlarged bottom of the spring—there was a huge shadow. The children looked at it in silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2804/77527.html","bookId":507,"book":{"id":507,"title":"Little Mr. Thimblefinger and His Queer Country","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a plantation, in the very middle of Middle Georgia, a little girl and a little boy and their negro nurse.
