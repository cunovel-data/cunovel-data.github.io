{"id":19877,"no":12,"title":"XII. A SINGING-MATCH.","content":"After telling how Brother Bear learned to comb his hair, Mr. Rabbit closed his eyes and seemed to be about to fall into a doze, as old people have been known to do. During the pause that followed, Sweetest Susan saw what appeared to be a bird of peculiar shape sailing around in the sky of Mr. Thimblefinger’s queer country. It was long of body and seemed to have no wings, and yet it sailed about overhead as majestically and easily as an eagle could have done. “What sort of a bird is it?” inquired Sweetest Susan, pointing out the object to Mrs. Meadows. “Now, really, I don’t know,” was the reply. “They are so high in the sky and I’ve seen them so often that I’ve never bothered my head about them.” Mr. Thimblefinger climbed on the back of a chair, so as to get a better view of the curious bird, but he shook his head and climbed nimbly [Pg 140] down again. The queer bird was too much for Mr. Thimblefinger. Mr. Rabbit opened his eyes lazily and looked at it. “If I’m not much mistaken—” he started to say, but Drusilla broke in without any ceremony:— “’T ain’t nothin’ ’t all, but one er dem ar meller bugs what swims roun’ in de spring.” “Why, I expect it is a mellow bug,” said Mrs. Meadows, laughing. “I used to catch them when I was a girl and put them in my handkerchief. They smell just like a ripe apple.” “I thought it was a buzzard,” said Buster John. “No,” remarked Mr. Rabbit, “I used to be well acquainted with Brother Buzzard, and when he’s in the air he’s longer from side to side than he is from end to end. I don’t know when I’ve thought of Brother Buzzard before. I never liked him much, but I used to see him sailing around on sunshiny days, or sitting in the top of a dead pine drying his wings after a heavy rain. He cut a very funny figure sitting up there, with his wings spread out and drooping like a sick chicken. LITTLE MR. THIMBLEFINGER [Pg 141] “I remember the time, too, when he had a singing-match with Brother Crow, and I nearly laughed myself to death over it.” “Oh, tell us about it,” cried Buster John. “There’s nothing in it when it is told,” replied Mr. Rabbit. “There are some things that are funny when you see them, but not funny at all when you come to tell about them.” “We don’t mind that,” said Sweetest Susan. “I don’t know exactly how it came about,” resumed Mr. Rabbit, after a pause, “but as near as I can remember, Brother Buzzard and Brother Crow met with each other early one morning in a big pine-tree. They howdied, but there was a sort of coolness between them on account of the fact that Brother Buzzard had been going about the neighborhood making his brags and his boasts that he could outfly Brother Crow. They hadn’t been up in the tree very long before they began to dispute. Brother Buzzard was not a very loud talker in those days, whatever he may be now, but Brother Crow could squall louder than a woman who has been married twenty-two years. And so there they had it, quarreling and disputing and disturbing the peace.” [Pg 142] “What were they quarreling about?” Buster John inquired. “Well,” replied Mr. Rabbit, “you know the road that leads to Brag is the shortest route to Bluster. Brother Buzzard and Brother Crow were quarreling because they had been bragging, and a little more and they’d have had a regular pitched battle then and there. “‘Maybe you can outfly me, Brother Buzzard,’ says Mr. Crow, ‘but I’ll be bound you can’t outsing me.’ “‘I have never tried,’ says Brother Buzzard, says he. “‘Well, suppose you try it now,’ says Brother Crow. ‘I’ll go you a fine suit of clothes, and a cocked hat to boot, that I can sit here and sing longer than you can,’ says he. “‘Oh, ho!’ says Brother Buzzard, ‘you may sing louder, but you can’t sing longer than I can,’ says he. “‘Is it a go?’ says Brother Crow. “‘It’s a go,’ says Brother Buzzard, says he. “‘It’s no fair bet,’ says Brother Crow, ‘because you are a bigger man than I am, and it stands to reason that you have got more wind in [Pg 143] your craw than I have, but I shall give you one trial if I split my gizzard,’ says he. “Yes,” remarked Mr. Rabbit, scratching his head thoughtfully, “those were the very words he used—‘if I split my gizzard,’ says he. Well, they shook hands to ratify the bet, and then Brother Crow, without making any flourishes, raised the tune,— “‘Oh, Susy, my Susy, gangloo! Oh, Milly, my Molly, langloo!’ “Then Brother Buzzard flung his head back and chimed in,— “‘Oh, Susy, my Susy, gangloo! Oh, Milly, my Molly, langloo!’ and such another racket as they made I never heard before, and have never heard since.” “Why, what kind of a song was it?” inquired Sweetest Susan. “I’m sure I never heard such a song.” “Well,” replied Mr. Rabbit, “you are young and I am old, but you know just as much about that song as I do, and maybe more than I do, for you haven’t been pestered with it as long as I have. It is a worse riddle to me than it was the day I heard it.” [Pg 144] “What did they do then?” asked Buster John. “Well,” Mr. Rabbit replied, “they sat there and sang just as I told you. Brother Buzzard would stop to catch his breath and then break out,— “‘Oh, Susy, my Susy, gangloo! Oh, Milly, my Molly, langloo!’ and then Brother Crow would squall out,— “‘Oh, Susy, my Susy, gangloo! Oh, Milly, my Molly, langloo!’ “They sang on until they began to get hungry, and as Brother Buzzard seemed to be the biggest and fattest of the two, everybody thought he would hold out the longest. But Brother Crow was plucky, and he sang right along in spite of the emptiness in his craw. He didn’t squall as loud as he did at first, but every time Brother Buzzard sang, Brother Crow would sing, too. By and by, they both began to get very weak. “At last, as luck would have it, Brother Crow saw his wife flying over, and he sang out as loud as he could:— THE SINGING-MATCH “‘Oh, Susy!—Go tell my children—my [Pg 145] Susy,—to bring my dinner—gangloo!—and tell them—oh, Milly, my Molly,—to bring it quickly—langloo!’ “It wasn’t very long after that before all Brother Crow’s family connections came flying to help him, and as soon as they found out how matters stood they brought him more victuals than he knew what to do with. Brother Buzzard held out as long as he could, but he was obliged to give up, and since that time there has been mighty little singing in the Buzzard family. “But that isn’t all,” remarked Mr. Rabbit, as solemnly as if he were pointing a moral. “Since that time Brother Crow, who was dressed in white, has been wearing the black suit that he won from Brother Buzzard.” “Speaking of singing birds,” said Mr. Thimblefinger, turning to Mrs. Meadows, “what is that song I used to hear you humming about a little bird?” “Oh, it’s just a nonsense song,” replied Mrs. Meadows. “It has no beginning and no ending.” But the children said they wanted to hear it, anyhow, and so Mrs. Meadows sang about— There was once a little Bird so full of Song That he sang in the Rose-Bush the whole Night long. And “Oh,” said the Redbird to the Jay, “Don’t you wish you could sit and sing that way?” “Mercy, no!” said the Jay; “for he sings too late; I sing well enough for to please my Mate.” There was once a little Bird so full of Song That he sang in the Rose-Bush the whole Night long. Then “Oh,” said the Redbird to the Crow, “Don’t you wish you could sit and sing just so?” “Do hush,” said the Crow, “or I’ll start for to weep, Be—caw—caw—cause he’s a-losing of his sleep.” There was once a little Bird so full of Song That he sang in the Rose-Bush the whole Night long. And “Oh,” said the Redbird to the Wren, “Don’t you wish you could sing so now and then?” “Not me,” said the Wren as she shook her Head; “I think his Mamma ought to put him to Bed.” But the Singing Bird was so full of Glee That he sang all night in the Rose-Bush Tree.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2804/77533.html","bookId":507,"book":{"id":507,"title":"Little Mr. Thimblefinger and His Queer Country","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a plantation, in the very middle of Middle Georgia, a little girl and a little boy and their negro nurse.
