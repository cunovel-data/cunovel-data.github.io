A STORY OF THE RIVER.","content":"“I think that was a beautiful story,” said Sweetest Susan, when Mrs. Meadows paused; “but was that the end?” “Why, wasn’t that enough?” inquired Mr. Rabbit sleepily. “What more could you ask? Didn’t the boy and girl get back home where they could get something to eat?” “What became of them?” asked Buster John. “The stories about boys and girls in books say they married and lived happily ever after.” “Oh, yes!” cried Mr. Thimblefinger. “I’ve heard about it. I remember the poetry,— “‘They married, then, and lived in clover, And when they died, they died all over.’” “Well,” said Mrs. Meadows, “I thought surely you’d get tired of Valentine and Geraldine by the time they got back home, and so I thought we’d do well to leave them there. Still, if you [Pg 216] are not tired—” Mrs. Meadows paused and looked at the children. “Oh, we are not tired,” protested Buster John. “Well,” said Mrs. Meadows, “if that’s the case, I’ll tell you what happened after Valentine and Geraldine went back home. Of course, Geraldine’s father and mother were very proud and happy when their little girl was brought back to them. They were very grateful to Valentine, and they offered him money. But somehow Valentine didn’t want their money. He said that the pleasure of getting Geraldine out of the hands of the wicked Conjurer was reward enough for him, and so he shook his head and refused the money that was offered him. “Now, the little girl’s father was rich and prosperous, while Valentine was very poor, and it was natural that the rich man should wonder why the boy, who was poor, should refuse money. Somehow, he took a dislike to Valentine. He said to himself that a boy who would refuse money as a free gift would never be prosperous. “As time went on, Valentine grew to be a handsome young man, but he was still poor. He went to see Geraldine sometimes, but as she grew [Pg 217] older, she grew shyer. Valentine couldn’t understand this, but he thought it was because she was old enough to know that she was rich and he was poor. “He said to her one day. ‘You are not as friendly as you used to be.’ “‘Oh, yes I am,’ she replied. ‘I shall always be friendly with you.’ “‘No,’ said he, ‘you have changed.’ “‘No more than you,’ was her answer. “‘I changed?’ he cried. ‘I love you more than I ever did.’ “With that Geraldine hung her head to hide her blushes, but Valentine thought she was angry. He turned on his heel and would have gone away, but she called him back, and told him not to go away angry—and then they made it up somehow. Valentine said he would speak to Geraldine’s father. This he did, but the father shook his head. “‘You want to take her to a hut?’ he cried. ‘Why she might as well have stayed in the Conjurer’s cave. Go and get you a fortune, and then come back, and maybe we’ll talk the matter over.’ “Valentine went away very sad. He never [Pg 218] turned his head, although Geraldine was watching him from a window, ready to wave her hand and throw him a kiss. He wandered off into the woods until he came to the bank of the River, and there he sat watching the water go by. He watched it until he almost forgot his own trouble. It went along slowly and majestically, and sometimes it seemed to come eddying back to kiss the bank at his feet. For a little while it smoothed the wrinkles in his mind. He wondered where the River came from and where it was going to. It was always coming and always going, and there was never an end to it. All day long it went by, sometimes laughing and playing in the shallows and sometimes sighing a little under the willows. “Valentine watched it and listened to the pleasant sounds it made until he began to feel as if the River was something like a friend and companion. It soothed his grief and drove away his loneliness. Being alone, he began to speak his thoughts aloud. “‘Oh! I wish I had a friend as strong and as powerful as the River!’ he cried. “‘And why not?’ he heard a voice say. The water at his feet splashed a little louder. He [Pg 219] looked around, but saw no one; he listened, but heard nothing. “‘I wonder who could have spoken?’ he said aloud. “‘Who but your friend, the River?’ a Voice replied. “‘Please don’t mock me, whoever you are. There is no fun in misfortune,’ said Valentine. “‘None at all’ responded the Voice. ‘I am your friend the River. I will give you all the aid in my power.’ “‘How am I to know the River is talking?’ Valentine asked. “‘By this,’ replied the River. At the word, a wave larger than all the rest sprang up the bank, and threw its spray in Valentine’s hair and face. ‘That is my salute,’ said the River. ‘It is a rough way, but I know no other. Now, how can I aid you?’ “‘That is what troubles me,’ responded Valentine. ‘You are always going; you never stay.’ “‘True,’ said the River; ‘but I am always coming. Therefore I must be always returning.’ “‘But how?’ Valentine asked. “‘Not this way,’ said the River, ‘but over [Pg 220] your head. When in the early morning, or in the warmer noon, or in the pleasant evenings, you see the white clouds flying westward, you may be sure that I am returning.’ Then the River broke into a thousand ripples, as if smiling. “But Valentine sat with a very serious face. ‘I do not know how you can aid me,’ he sighed. “‘I know what you wish,’ the River replied. ‘You wish riches.’ “‘Yes,’ said Valentine, ‘but not for the sake of the riches themselves.’ “‘Of course not!’ the River exclaimed. ‘Riches would be worthless if they could not command something better; and they are worse than worthless when the power they give is used for evil. I can give you riches, but not without your help. I can give you the power to obtain wealth, but I cannot give you the power to use it as it should be used.’ “Valentine listened to the mysterious Voice of the River like one in a dream. He could hardly believe his ears. “‘You say nothing,’ said the River; ‘you seem half asleep. But if I am to help you, you must help yourself. Walk by my side a little way. [Pg 221] Further down you will come to a boat that has drifted against the bank.’ VALENTINE TALKING TO THE RIVER “Valentine rose and stretched himself, and walked by the side of the River. He had not gone far before he came upon a boat that had drifted into an eddy. It lay there rocking, and a long oar rested against the seat. “‘Jump in,’ said the River; ‘shove the boat away from the bank and trust to me. Take the oar and pull, and I will push you along.’ “Valentine did as he was told, and he soon found that the boat was gliding swiftly along. The trees and houses on each side seemed to be running a race to the rear, and the boats that he passed on the River seemed to be standing still. He went on for some hours, always trusting to the River. When he grew tired, he held his oar in the air and rested, but whether he rested or whether he rowed, he saw that his boat was always gliding swiftly along. “Presently, in the far distance, he could see the spires and steeples of a city, and he wondered whether he would be compelled to go gliding by, or whether the River would land him there. But he was not left long in doubt. [Pg 222] “‘That is your future home,’ said the River. ‘There you will find friends, and there you will become rich and famous.’ “‘But how?’ asked Valentine. “‘I can only tell you the beginning,’ replied the River. ‘When your boat glides to the landing-place, you will see there an old gentleman richly dressed. He will ask you if you have seen his little son. He has been there every day for two days, and he has asked of all comers the same question.’ “‘What shall I say to him?’ asked Valentine. “‘Tell him you have not seen his son,’ replied the River, ‘but that you feel sure you can find the boy. Tell the old gentleman that you have come a long journey, and need rest, but that when you have refreshed yourself, you will go and seek his son.’ “‘But where shall I seek for the boy?’ asked Valentine. “‘Come to me,’ said the River. ‘I will be here. I am always going, and yet I am always coming.’ “By this time they had come to the city. ‘Row for the landing,’ said the River; ‘your fortune is there.’ [Pg 223] “Valentine dipped his oar in the water and rowed to the landing. He leaped from his boat, threw the chain around a stake, and looked around. Sure enough, an old gentleman, richly dressed, was walking up and down, his hands crossed behind him. When he saw Valentine he paused and looked at him. Valentine bowed politely as he had been taught to do. “‘You are a comely lad,’ said the old gentleman. ‘Did you come down the River, or from below?’ “‘I came down the River,’ replied Valentine, touching his hat again. “‘I have lost my youngest son,’ said the old gentleman. ‘He is a little boy about six years old. He wandered from home two days ago, came to the River landing, and was last seen playing in a boat. I have been trying to find him. My boats have been searching in all directions, but the child cannot be found.’ “‘I think I can find him,’ said Valentine, ‘but first I must rest and refresh myself. I have come a long journey, and I am tired.’ “The old gentleman seized him by the hand. ‘Come with me!’ he exclaimed. ‘You shall go [Pg 224] to my house. Your every want shall be supplied. If you succeed in finding my lost boy you shall have whatever you ask for.’ “‘I shall ask for nothing,’ replied Valentine. ‘The pleasure I shall have in restoring your son to your arms will be sufficient reward for me.’ “‘Nevertheless,’ said the gentleman, ‘you shall have a more substantial reward than that.’ “So he took Valentine home, and treated him with the greatest kindness. He was served with rich food and the finest spiced wines, and fitted out with an elegant suit of clothes. Early the next morning, Valentine thanked the gentleman for his kindness. “‘I go now,’ he said, ‘to find your son. Watch for me near the River. I may return soon, or I may be gone long, but when I return I will bring your son.’ “‘You are young,’ remarked the gentleman. ‘You are hopeful and brave. You imagine you can succeed where others have failed. But I fear not. My lost boy has been sought by men older than you, and quite as brave, but they have not found him.’ “‘Certainly, I may fail,’ Valentine replied. [Pg 225] ‘If I depended on myself alone, I know I would fail. But I trust in Providence.’ “Valentine and the gentleman then went to the River—one to go in search of the lost child, and the other to watch and wait for the return. Valentine went to the water’s edge. “‘Get a boat with a sail,’ whispered the River, lapping the sand at his feet. This was provided at once, for the gentleman was very wealthy, and then Valentine set out on his voyage. ‘Go back the way you came,’ said the River, ‘but keep out of the middle current. Let the wind fill your sails and carry you near the shore, on the right.’ With the River to direct him, Valentine sailed along with a light heart and a happy mind. For more than two hours he journeyed up the River, and it was not until the sun was low in the west that the River told him to lower the sails of his boat. This done, the River carried his boat gently ashore, and as it glided on the sand, he saw, near by, a boat, in which a little boy lay fast asleep. Without disturbing him, Valentine lifted the little fellow in his arms, and transferred him to the new boat, in which wraps, and cloaks, and food had been placed. [Pg 226] “It was easy to guess how the little boy had been lost. He had gone to play in a boat, which broke loose from its fastenings, and drifted slowly up the River in the eddies that play hide and seek near the bank. The first day the searchers searched for him, they went too far. The next day they searched too near, and so the child drifted and drifted, and was lost sure enough. He was very cold and wet when Valentine found him, but in a little while he was warmly wrapped in the cloaks that had been provided. “‘Take his boat in tow,’ said the River. ‘Let your sails stay down, and take the oars and row home as hard as you can.’ “The River helped with its swift current, and it was not long before Valentine caught a glimpse of the bonfire that was burning at the landing to light him back to the city. “There was great rejoicing when Valentine returned with the lost child. The bells were rung and salutes fired from the big cannon that commanded the approaches to the city. It turned out that the gentleman whose child Valentine had found was the ruler of the city, and you may depend upon it he was grateful to the unknown young man. [Pg 227] “But in all large cities there are some envious people, and these soon had it whispered about that Valentine was a mere adventurer who had stolen the child and hid it so that he might rescue it again when a big reward was offered. These whispers grew thicker and thicker until at last they reached the ears of every one. No one knew Valentine, and appearances were against him, but one day he was approached by an old man with a long white beard, who asked him from whence he came. The old man was so kind and agreeable in his manner that Valentine told him the story of the rescue of Geraldine. “Much to his surprise the old man rose and embraced him. ‘Come with me!’ he cried. So saying, he carried Valentine to the marketplace, and there in the presence of a great crowd of people, the old man said:— “‘Behold my rescuer! Behold the brave youth who conquered Rimrak, the Conjurer.’ “This closed the mouths of the envious, and when that happens, there is not much more to tell in any story.” Here Mrs. Meadows paused and looked at Mr. Rabbit, who sat fast asleep in his chair. [Pg 228] “Did he get rich and marry Geraldine?” inquired Sweetest Susan. “Why of course,” replied Mrs. Meadows. “Do you reckon he’d have gone through all these ups and downs if he wasn’t to marry and settle down and be happy in the end?” “Well,” said Buster John, “it was a pretty good story.” “I speck so,” remarked Drusilla, “but dey’s lots too much richness in it fer me.” Mrs. Meadows laughed so heartily at this that Mr. Rabbit was aroused from his nap, and looked around in surprise. “Did I hear somebody say supper was ready?” he asked. Mrs. Meadows laughed again, but this time she glanced at the sky of Mr. Thimblefinger’s queer country. It had grown perceptibly darker. Mr. Thimblefinger drew out his little watch. Mr. Rabbit closed one eye, and sat as if listening for something. “Well,” said Mrs. Meadows with a sigh, “I reckon we’ll have to tell you good-by for this time, but I do hope you’ll come again. I declare it has been a treat to have some new somebody to [Pg 229] talk to. By the time you get back home the sun will be setting in your country, and your folks will begin to be uneasy about you.” BUSTER JOHN SHAKING HANDS WITH MR. RABBIT The children were not at all anxious to go. They had had a very curious experience in Mr. Thimblefinger’s queer country, and they had almost forgotten that the sun in their part of the world had a habit of going down. But they said they were ready, and then they shook hands all around. When Buster John came to shake hands with Mr. Rabbit, the latter looked at the youngster a moment. “Did you ever happen to know a colored man named Aaron?” he asked. “Uncle Aaron!” exclaimed Buster John. “Why, he lives on our plantation. He’s the foreman.” “Well,” said Mr. Rabbit solemnly, “when you see Aaron, take his left hand in both of yours, bend his thumb back a little, and with your right thumb make this mark X with horizontal line through it. The first time he will pay no attention. Make it the second time. Then he will be ready to listen. Make it the third time. Then he will ask you what you want. Say to him that you want to learn the language of the animals.” [Pg 230] “Won’t he get angry?” asked Buster John. “Try him,” replied Mr. Rabbit with a cunning look. “Now, good-by!” “When you get ready to come again,” said Mrs. Meadows, “just drop a big apple in the spring, and I’ll be bound we’ll all see it and know what it means. And when you come be sure and bring the apple. It’s been a month of Sundays since I’ve had one.” The children promised they would, and then, with Mr. Thimblefinger leading the way, they started home, which they reached without further adventure. As they stood on the brink of the spring, waving their hands to Mr. Thimblefinger, who was smiling at them from the bottom, Drusilla remarked with unction:— “I dunner how ’t is wid you all, but I don’t no mo’ b’lieve we been down dar under dat water dar dan—dan—dan de man in de moon. Dat I don’t!” \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2804/77540.html","bookId":507,"book":{"id":507,"title":"Little Mr. Thimblefinger and His Queer Country","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a plantation, in the very middle of Middle Georgia, a little girl and a little boy and their negro nurse.
