THE STRAWBERRY-GIRL.","content":"“Isn’t it almost time for us to start home?” said Sweetest Susan, turning to Mr. Thimblefinger. “Why, you’ve got all the afternoon before you,” replied Mr. Thimblefinger. “Besides it will be downhill all the way. I was just going to tell you a story, but if you really want to go I’ll put off the telling of it until some of your grandchildren tumble in the spring when the wet water has run out and the dry water has taken its place.” “Tell the story, please,” said Buster John. “It’s about a girl,” remarked Mr. Thimblefinger. “She was called the Strawberry-Girl. My mother knew the girl well, and I’ve heard her tell the story many a time. But if you want to go home—” “Oh, please tell the story,” cried Sweetest Susan. [Pg 148] “Well,” said Mr. Thimblefinger; “once there was an old woman who lived in the woods. She lived all alone, and people said she was a witch. She was so old that the skin on her forehead had deep wrinkles in it, and these wrinkles caused everybody to think that the old woman was frowning all the time. People called her Granny Grim-Eye. “Whenever Granny Grim-Eye got hungry she went to a strawberry-patch in the field near where she lived, and gathered a basket of strawberries. One day when she went after strawberries she found a beautiful little girl asleep in the patch. “‘Hity-tity!’ said Granny Grim-Eye, ‘what are you doing here? Where did you come from, and where are you going?’ “The little girl awoke and stared at Granny Grim-Eye. She was tied to a blackberry-bush by a silver chain so fine that the links of it could hardly be seen with the naked eye. ‘Who are you?’ asked Granny Grim-Eye. “‘Nothing nor nobody,’ replied the little girl, and that was all the answer Granny Grim-Eye could get from the child. GRANNY GRIM-EYE FINDS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL ASLEEP [Pg 149] “‘Well,’ said Granny Grim-Eye, ‘this is my strawberry-patch, and everything I find in it belongs to me. I’ll take you home and see what I can make out of you.’ “So she took the girl home and cared for her, giving her the name of the Strawberry-Girl. In the course of time the Strawberry-Girl grew to be the most beautiful young woman in the country, but her mind was not bright. In fact, I have heard my mother say that the Strawberry-Girl was as stupid and as silly as she could be, but she was so beautiful that people were inclined to forgive her for being stupid. “Granny Grim-Eye used to send her with strawberries to sell to the rich man who owned nearly all the land in that part of the country. Now, this rich man fell in love with the Strawberry-Girl, but when he found that she was both stupid and silly he gave up all thought of marrying her. He was very fond of her, nevertheless, and bought all the berries she had for sale. But when she began to talk he would turn away with a sigh, for everything she said was stupid. “It so happened one day that Granny Grim-Eye was too sick to pick the strawberries [Pg 150] herself, as she always had done, and she was afraid to trust the Strawberry-Girl to pick them. But the rich man sent word that he was to have a company of friends to dinner and he must have some strawberries. There was nothing for Granny Grim-Eye to do but to send the Strawberry-Girl to the patch. Granny Grim-Eye called her up and cautioned her not to pick anything but good, ripe strawberries, and then sent her off to the patch. “But on the way the Strawberry-Girl saw some red berries growing on bushes, and these she picked and put in the basket until it was full. ‘These are just as red as ripe strawberries,’ she said, ‘and they will do just as well. Besides, they are a great deal easier to pick.’ “The way to the rich man’s house led through a very thick wood, and while the Strawberry-Girl was going through this wood a little old man stepped from a hollow tree and stood in the path before her. “‘Aha!’ says he, ‘I find you alone at last. Where are you going, and what have you got?’ THE LITTLE OLD MAN DISCOVERS THE STRAWBERRY-GIRL “‘I am carrying some strawberries to your [Pg 151] master,’ says the Strawberry-Girl, who imagined that the rich man was everybody’s master. “‘My master!’ cries the little old man; ‘my master! But if he were my master, and I wanted to get rid of him, I’d not get in your path, for every berry in your basket is rank poison.’ “‘Well, anyhow, they are red,’ says the stupid Strawberry-Girl. “‘So they are,’ says the little old man. ‘But if you want to kill your master carry them to him.’ “‘Oh, I don’t want to kill him,’ says the Strawberry-Girl. ‘He pays too well.’ “‘Once you belonged to me,’ says the little old man. ‘I tied you to a blackberry-bush with a fine silver chain, and left you there until I could attend to some business in the city. When I came back you were gone. I hunted for you high and low only to hear that you had been found by Granny Grim-Eye. What is the result? You have grown up beautiful and stupid. After all these years you don’t know a strawberry from a dragon’s-apple. If you had remained with me you would have grown to be the most beautiful as well as the wittiest woman in the world. You would have known everything that is hidden in [Pg 152] nature—everything that has been stored between the lids of all the books. It is a great pity!’ “‘Yes,’ says the stupid Strawberry-Girl, ‘I expect it is; but what must I do with these berries? I haven’t time to pick more.’ “‘Well,’ says the little old man, ‘I’ll make a bargain with you. I’ll fill your basket with the finest berries that were ever seen, and I’ll make you the wittiest woman in the world if at the end of one year you will marry me.’ “The stupid Strawberry-Girl gave her promise, and then the little old man touched her on the forehead with his left thumb, pointed at a bright star with his right forefinger, and then went back to his hollow tree, warning the girl not to forget her promise. “When she looked in the basket the red dragon’s-apples had disappeared, and in their place she saw the finest strawberries that had ever been grown. These she carried to the rich man, who was as much surprised at the size and lusciousness of the berries as his guests were at the extraordinary beauty of the young girl. They praised her beauty to their host, who shook his head and said that beauty ceased to be beautiful [Pg 153] when it was tied to stupidity. The guests, however, would not believe that so beautiful a creature could be stupid, and to satisfy them the rich man sent for the girl and engaged her in conversation. Her replies were so wise, so apt, and so witty, as to astound all the company, while the rich man was dumfounded with astonishment. “After that, when the Strawberry-Girl came with berries for sale, the rich man always sent for her, and her wit and intelligence were so pleasing to him that he finally asked her to be his wife. But she remembered the bargain she had made with the little old man who had met her in the wood, and she told the rich man that she would have to take time to consider his proposal. “She was very much worried. She fretted until she began to lose some of her beauty, and when Granny Grim-Eye saw this she began to ask questions, and it was not long before she found out all about the bargain the Strawberry-Girl had made with the little Old Man of the Wood. “‘Oho!’ she cried. ‘He is up to his old tricks, is he? Well, we shall see!’ “So she went to her chest and got the silver [Pg 154] chain with which the Strawberry-Girl had been fastened to the blackberry-bush, and wrapped and twined it in the shape of a star. This star she fixed on the Strawberry-Girl’s forehead by means of a velvet band, and told her to wear it constantly. “It happened that on the very day the year expired the Strawberry-Girl was walking through the wood. The little old man jumped from his hollow tree and ran forward to claim his bride. But when he saw the star shining on her forehead he gave a loud cry, threw his hands before his eyes, and turned and fled through the wood faster than any deer could have done. Nobody ever saw him again, and the Strawberry-Girl married the rich man and lived happily for many long years.” “I think that is a nice story,” said Sweetest Susan. “I’m glad you do,” remarked Mr. Thimblefinger. “My mother knew all the facts in the case, and I’ve heard her tell it many a time. I may have left out some of the happenings, but these and many others you can supply for yourself.” \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2804/77534.html","bookId":507,"book":{"id":507,"title":"Little Mr. Thimblefinger and His Queer Country","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a plantation, in the very middle of Middle Georgia, a little girl and a little boy and their negro nurse.
