{"id":103058,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"7 SLOWLY over my consciousness of the sickbed and the humid room there dropped the dark veil of Heaven. Spread out in all directions were the sentinel stars, splendid as they shone above the glinting towers of the glass city, and in this half-sleep, now aided by the most tranquil and blissful of illusions, the stars sang to me. Each from its fixed position in constellation and in void gave forth a precious glimmering sound, as if great chords were struck inside each flaming orb and by means of its brilliant gyrations broadcast through all the universal world. Such sounds I had never heard with my earthly ears. But no disclaimer can approximate this airy and translucent music, this harmony and symphony of celebration. Oh, Lord, if Thou wert music, this then would be Thy voice, and no discord could ever prevail against Thee. Thou wouldst cleanse the ordinary world of every troubling noise with this, the fullest expression of Thy most intricate and wondrous design, and all triviality would fade away, overwhelmed by this resounding perfection. This was my prayer, my heartfelt prayer, coming in an ancient tongue, most intimate and effortless as I lay slumbering. Stay with me, beauteous stars, I begged, and let me never seek to fathom this fusion of light and sound, but only give myself to it utterly and unquestionably. The stars grew large and infinite in their cold majestic light, and slowly all the night was gone and there remained one great glorious and sourceless illumination. I smiled. I felt my smile with blind fingers on my lips, and as the light grew brighter still and ever closer, as though it were an ocean of itself, I felt a great saving coolness over all my limbs. \"Don\u0027t fade, don\u0027t go away, don\u0027t leave me.\" My own whisper was a woeful small thing. I pressed my throbbing head into the pillow. But it had spent its time, this grand and overriding light, and now must fade and let the common blink of candles move against my half-closed eyes, and I must see the burnished gloom around my bed, and simple things, such as a rosary laid across my right hand with ruby beads and golden cross, and there a prayer book open to my left, its pages gently folding in a small stir of breeze that moved as well the smooth taffeta in ripples overhead in its wood frame. How lovely it all did seem, these plain and ordinary things that made up this silent and elastic moment. Where had they gone, my lovely swan-necked nurse and my weeping comrades? Had night worn them down to where they slept, so that I might cherish these quiet moments of unobserved wakefulness? My mind was gently crowded with a thousand lively recollections. I opened my eyes. All were gone, save one who sat beside me on the bed, looking down at me with eyes both dreamy and remote and coldly blue, far paler than a summer sky and filled with a near faceted light as they fixed so idly and indifferently upon me. My Master here, with hands folded in his lap, a seeming stranger viewing all as if it could not touch his chiseled grandeur. The smileless expression set upon his face seemed made there forever. \"Merciless!\" I whispered. \"No, oh, no,\" he said. His lips did not move. \"But tell me once again the whole tale. Describe this glassy city.\" \"Ah, yes, we\u0027ve talked of it, have we not, of those priests who said I must come back, and those old paintings, so antique, which I thought so very beautiful. Not made by human hands, you see, but by the power invested in me, which passed through me, and I had only to take up the brush and there the Virgin and the Saints were mine to discover.\" \"Don\u0027t cast those old forms away,\" he said, and once again his lips showed no sign of the voice I heard so distinctly, a voice that pierced my very ears as any human voice might do, with his tone, his very timbre. \"For forms change, and reason now is but tomorrow\u0027s superstition, and in that old restraint there lay a great sublime intent, an indefatigable purity. But tell me once again about the glassy city.\" I sighed. \"You\u0027ve seen the molten glass, as I have,\" I said, \"when taken from the furnace, a glowing blob of horrifying heat upon a spear of iron, a thing that melts and drips so that the artist\u0027s wand may pull and stretch it, or fill it full of breath to form the perfect rounded vessel. Well, it was as if that glass came up out of the moist Mother Earth herself, a molten torrent spewing to the clouds, and out of these great liquid jets were born the crowded towers of the glassy city-not imitating any form built by men, but perfect as the heated force of Earth had naturally ordained, in colors unimaginable. Who lived in such a place? How far away it seemed, yet utterly attainable. But one short walk over hills sweet with willowing green grass and leafy fluttering flowers of the same fantastical hues and tints, a quiet thunderous and impossible apparition.\" I looked at him, because I had been looking off and back into my vision. Tell me what these things mean,\" I asked. \"Where is this place, and why was I allowed to see it?\" He gave a sad sigh and looked away himself and now back at me, his face as aloof and unbending as before, only now I saw the thick blood in it, that once again, as it had been the night before, was pumped full of human heat from human veins, which had no doubt been his late repast this same evening. \"Won\u0027t you even smile now as you say farewell?\" I asked. \"If this bitter coldness now is all you feel, and you would let me die of this rampant fever? I\u0027m sick unto death, you know it. You know the nausea that I feel, you know the hurt inside my head, you know the ache in all my joints and how these cuts burn in my skin with their indisputable poison. Why are you so very far away, yet here, come home, to sit beside me and feel nothing?\" \"I feel the love I\u0027ve always felt when I look at you,\" he said, \"my child, my son, my sweet enduring one. I feel it. It\u0027s walled up inside where it should stay, perhaps, and let you die, for yes, you will, and then perhaps your priests will take you, for how can they not when there is no returning?\" \"Ah, but what if there are many lands? What if on the second fall, I find myself on yet another shore, and sulfur rises from the boiling earth and not the beauty first revealed to me? I hurt. These tears are scalding. So much is lost. I can\u0027t remember. It seems I say those same words so much. I can\u0027t remember!\" I reached out. He didn\u0027t move. My hand grew heavy and dropped on the forgotten prayer book. I felt the stiff vellum pages beneath my fingers. \"What\u0027s killed your love? Was it the things I did? That I brought the man here who slew my brothers? Or that I died and saw such wonders? Answer me.\" \"I love you still. I will all my nights and all my slumbering days, forever. Your face is as a jewel given me, which I can never forget, though I may foolishly lose it. Its glister will torture me forever. Amadeo, think on these things again, open your mind as if it were a shell, and let me see the pearl of all they taught you.\" \"Can you, Master? Can you understand how love and love alone could mean so very much, and all the world be made of it? The very blades of grass, the leaves of trees, the fingers of this hand that reaches for you? Love, Master. Love. And who will believe such simple and immense things when there are dexterous and labyrinthian creeds and philosophies of manmade and ever seductive complexity? Love. I heard the sound of it. I saw it. Were these the delusions of a feverish mind, a mind afraid of death?\" \"Perhaps,\" he said, his face still feelingless and motionless. His eyes were narrow, prisoners of their own shrinking from what they saw. \"Ah, yes,\" he said. \"You die and I let you, and I think there might be for you but one shore, and there you\u0027ll find again your priests, your city.\" \"It\u0027s not my time,\" I said. \"I know it. And such a statement cannot be undone by a mere handful of hours. Smash the ticking clock. They meant, by a soul\u0027s incarnate life, it wasn\u0027t time. Some destiny carved in my infant hand will not be so soon fulfilled or easily defeated.\" \"I can tip the odds, my child,\" he said. This time his lips moved. The pale sweet coral brightened in his face, and his eyes grew wide and unguarded, the old self I knew and cherished. \"I can so easily take the last strength left in you.\" He leant over me. I saw the tiny variegations in the pupils of his eyes, the bright deep-pointed stars behind the darkening irises. His lips, so wondrously decorated with all the tiny lines of human lips, were rosy as if a human kiss resided there. \"I can so easily take one last fatal drink of your child\u0027s blood, one last quaff of all the freshness I so love, and in my arms I\u0027ll hold a corpse so rich in beauty that all who see it will weep, and that corpse will tell me nothing. You are gone, that much I\u0027ll know, and no more.\" \"Do you say these things to torture me? Master, if I cannot go there, I want to be with you!\" His lip worked in plain desperation. He seemed a man, and only that, the red blood of fatigue and sadness hovering on the borders of his eyes. His hand, out now to touch my hair, was trembling. I caught it as if it were the high waving branch of a tree above me. I fathered his fingers to my lips like so many leaves and kissed them. Turning my head I laid them on my wounded cheek. I felt the throb of the venomous cut beneath them. But more keenly still, I felt a strong tremor within them. I blinked my eyes. \"How many died tonight to feed you?\" I whispered. \"And how can this be, and love be the very thing the world is made of? You are too beautiful to be overlooked. I\u0027m lost. I cannot understand it. But could I, if I were to live from this moment on, a simple mortal boy, could I forget it?\" \"You cannot live, Amadeo,\" he said sadly. \"You cannot live!\" His voice broke. \"The poison\u0027s traveled in you too deep, too far and wide, and little draughts of my blood cannot overtake it.\" His face was filled with anguish. \"Child, I can\u0027t save you. Close your eyes. Take my farewell kiss. There is no friendship between me and those on the far shore, but they must take what dies so naturally.\" \"Master, no! Master, I cannot try it alone. Master, they sent me back, and you are here, and were bound to be, and how could they not have known it?\" \"Amadeo, they didn\u0027t care. The guardians of the dead are powerfully indifferent. They speak of love, but not of centuries of blundering ignorance. What stars are these that sing so beautifully when all the world is languishing in dissonance? I would you would force their hand, Amadeo.\" His voice all but broke in his pain. \"Amadeo, what right have they to charge me with your fortune?\" I laughed a weak sad little laugh. My fever shook me. A great wave of sickness overcame me. If I moved or spoke I would suffer a dread dry nausea that would shake me to no advantage. I\u0027d rather die than feel this. \"Master, I knew you would give it some powerful analysis,\" I said. I tried not to make a bitter or sarcastic smile, but to seek the simple truth. My breath was now so hard for me. It seemed I could leave off breathing with no hardship at all. All Bianca\u0027s stern encouragements came back to me. \"Master,\" I said, \"there is no horror in this world that is without final redemption.\" \"Yes, but for some,\" he pressed, \"What is the price of such salvation? Amadeo, how dare they requisition me to their obscure designs! I pray they were illusions. Don\u0027t speak anymore about their marvelous light. Don\u0027t think on it.\" \"No, Sir? And for whose comfort do I sweep my mind so clean? Who is dying here!\" He shook his head. \"Go ahead, wring the blood tears from your eyes,\" I said. \"And for what death do you hope yourself, Sir, for you told me that it wasn\u0027t impossible for even you to die? Explain to me, that is, if there\u0027s time left before all the light I shall ever know winks out on me, and the Earth devours the incarnate jewel that you found wanting!\" \"Never wanting,\" he whispered. \"Come now, where will you go, Sir? More comfort, please. How many minutes do I have?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he whispered. He turned away from me and bowed his head. I had never seen him so forlorn. \"Let me see your hand,\" I said weakly. \"There are closeted witches who in the shadows of the taverns of Venice have taught me how to read the lines in it. I\u0027ll tell you when you are like to die. Give it to me.\" I could scarcely see. A haze had come down over all things. But I meant my words. \"You come too late,\" he replied. \"There are no lines left.\" He held up his palm for me to see. \"Time has erased what men call fate. I have none.\" \"I am sorry that you come at all,\" I said. I turned away from him. I turned away against the clean cool linen of the pillow. \"Would you leave me now, my beloved teacher? I would rather the company of a priest, and my old nurse if you haven\u0027t sent her home. I have loved you with my whole heart, but I don\u0027t want to die in your superior company.\" Through a haze I saw the shape of him as he grew nearer to me. I felt his hands cup my face and turn it towards him. I saw the glimmer of his blue eyes, wintry flames, indistinct yet burning fiercely. \"Very well, beautiful one. This is the moment. Would you come with me, and be like me?\" His voice was rich and soothing, though it was full of pain. \"Yes, always and forever yours.\" \"Forever to thrive in secret on the blood of the evildoer, as I thrive, and to abide with these secrets until the end of the world, if need be.\" \"I shall. I want it.\" \"To learn from me all the lessons I can give.\" \"Yes, all of them.\" He picked me up from the bed. I tumbled against him, my head spinning and the pain in it so sharp, I cried out softly. \"Only a little while, my love, my young and tender love,\" he said in my ear. I was lowered into the warm water of the bath, my clothes softly stripped away, my head laid back against the tiled edge ever so carefully. I let my arms float in the water. I felt it lap around my shoulders. He broke up handfuls of water to bathe me. He bathed first my face and then all of me. His hard satiny fingertips moved over my face. \"Not a vagrant hair yet of your beard, and yet you have the nether endowments of a man, and must now rise above the pleasures you have so loved.\" \"I do, I will,\" I whispered. A terrible burning lashed my cheek. The cut was spread wide. I struggled to touch it. But he held my hand. It was only his blood fallen into the festering wound. And as the flesh tingled and burnt I felt it closing. He did the same with the scratch on my arm, and then with the small scratch on the back of my hand. With my eyes closed, I surrendered to the eerie paralyzing pleasure of it. His hand touched me again, running smoothly down my chest, past my private parts, examining first one leg and then the other, searching out the smallest break or flaw in the skin, perhaps. Again the rich throbbing chills of pleasure overcame me. I felt myself lifted from the water, warmly wrapped, and then there came that shock of moving air that meant he carried me, that he moved more swiftly than any spying eye could see. I felt the marble floor before my bare feet, and in my fever, this jolting cold was very good to me. We stood in the studio. We had our backs to the painting on which he\u0027d worked only nights ago, and faced another masterly canvas of immense size, on which beneath a brilliant sun and cobalt sky a great copse of trees surrounded two rushing windblown figures. The woman was Daphne, her upstretched arms changing into the branches of the laurel, already thick with leaves, her feet grown into roots that sought the deep brown earth beneath her. And behind her, the desperate and beautiful god Apollo, a champion of golden hair and finely muscled limbs, come too late to stop her frantic magical escape from his threatening arms, her fatal metamorphosis. \"See the indifferent clouds above,\" my Master whispered in my ear. He pointed to the great streaks of sun he had painted with more skill than the men who daily beheld them. He spoke words I confided to Lestat so long ago when I told him my story, words that he salvaged so mercifully from the few images of these times which I was able to give him. I hear Marius\u0027s voice when I repeat these words, the last I was ever to hear as a mortal child: \"This is the only sun that you will ever see again. But a millennium of nights will be yours to see light as no mortal has ever seen it, to snatch from the distant stars, as if you were Prometheus, an endless illumination by which to understand all things.\" And I, who had beheld a far more wondrous celestial light in that realm from which I\u0027d been turned away, longed only for him to eclipse it now forever.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6/page-7.html","bookId":2214,"book":{"id":2214,"title":"The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6) Armand until now has played a small role in the Vampire Chronicles.
