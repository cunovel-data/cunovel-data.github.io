One shoe was left to him, the other foot bare, his coat torn, his hair wild and snagged with thorns and dried leaves and bits of errant flowers.\n In his arms, to his chest he clutched a flat bundle of folded cloth as if it carried the whole fate of the world embroidered on it.\n But the worst, the very worst horror of all, was that one eye had been torn from his beautiful face, and the socket of vampiric lids puckered and shuddered, seeking to close, refusing to acknowledge this horrid disfigurement to the body rendered perfect for all time when he\u0027d been made immortal.\n I wanted to take him in my arms. I wanted to comfort him, to tell him wherever he\u0027d gone and whatever had taken place, he was now safe again with us, but nothing could quiet him.\n A deep exhaustion saved us all from the inevitable tale. We had to seek our dark corners away from the prying sun, we had to wait until the following night when he would come out to us and tell us what had happened.\n Still clutching the bundle, refusing all help, he closeted himself up with his wound. I had no choice but to leave him.\n As I sank down that morning into my own resting place, secure in clean modern darkness, I cried and cried like a child on account of the sight of him. Oh, why had I come to his aid? Why must I see him brought low like this when it had taken so many painful decades to cement my love for him forever?\n Once before, a hundred years ago, he\u0027d come stumbling into the Theatre des Vampires on the trail of his renegade fledglings, sweet gentle Louis and the doomed child, and I hadn\u0027t pitied him then, his skin scored with scars from Claudia\u0027s foolish and clumsy attempt to kill him.\n Loved him then, yes, I had, but this had been a bodily disaster which his evil blood would heal, and I knew from our old lore that in the healing he would gain even greater strength than serene time itself would have given him.\n But what I\u0027d seen now was a devastation of the soul in his anguished face, and the vision of the one blue eye, shining so vividly in his streaked and wretched face, had been unbearable.\n I don\u0027t remember that we spoke, David. I remember only that the morning hastened us away, and if you cried too, I never heard you, I never thought to listen. As for the bundle he had carried in his arms, what could it have possibly been? I do not even think I thought of it.\n The next night:\n He came quietly into the parlor of the apartment as the darkness clambered down, starry for a few precious moments before the dreary descent of snow. He was washed and dressed, his torn and bleeding foot no doubt healed. He wore new shoes.\n But nothing could lessen the grotesque picture of his torn face where the cuts of a claw or fingernails surrounded the gaping, puckering lids. Quietly he sat down.\n He looked at me, and a faint charming smile brightened his face. \"Don\u0027t fear for me, little devil Armand,\" he said. \"Fear for all of us. I am nothing now. I am nothing.\"\n In a low voice I whispered to him my plan. \"Let me go down into the streets, let me steal from some mortal, some evil being who has wasted every physical gift that God ever gave, an eye for you! Let me put it here in the empty socket. Your blood will rush into it and make it see. You know. You saw this miracle once with the ancient one, Maharet, indeed, with a pair of mortal eyes swimming in her special blood, eyes that could see! I\u0027ll do it. It won\u0027t take me but a moment, and then I\u0027ll have the eye in my hand and be the doctor myself and place it here. Please.\"\n He only shook his head. He kissed me quickly on the cheek.\n \"Why do you love me after all I\u0027ve done to you?\" he asked. There was no denying the beauty of his smooth poreless sun-darkened skin, and even as the dark slit of the empty socket seemed to peer at me with some secret power to relay its vision to his heart. He was handsome and radiant, a darkish ruddy glow coming from his face as though he\u0027d seen some powerful mystery.\n \"Yes, but I have,\" he said, and now began to cry. \"I have, and I must tell you everything. Believe me, as you believe what you saw last night, the wildflowers clinging still to my hair, the cuts-look, my hands, they heal but not fast enough-believe me.\"\n You intervened then, David. \"Tell us, Lestat. We would have waited here forever for you. Tell us. Where did this demon Memnoch take you?\" How comforting and reasonable your voice sounded, just as it does now. I think you were made for this, for reasoning, and given to us, if I may speculate, to force us to see our catastrophes in the new light of modern conscience. But we can talk of those things for many nights hereafter.\n Let me return to the scene, the three of us gathered in the black-lacquered Chinese chairs around the thick glass table, and Dora coming in, at once struck by the presence of him, of which her mortal senses hadn\u0027t given her a clue, a pretty picture with her short gleaming knavish black hair, cut high to show the fragile nape of her swanlike neck, her long supple body clad in a loose ungirdled gown of purple red tissue that folded itself about her small breasts and slender thighs exquisitely. Ah, what an angel of the Lord, this, I thought musing, this heiress of the druglord Father\u0027s severed head. She teaches doctrines with every step that would make the pagan gods of lust canonize her with glee.\n About her pale sweet throat she wore a crucifix so tiny it seemed a gilded gnat suspended from a weightless chain of minuscule links woven by fairies. What are such holy objects now, tumbling on milky bosoms with such ease, but trinkets of the marketplace? My thoughts were merciless, but I was but an indifferent cataloger of her beauty. Her swelling breasts, their shadowy cleft quite visible against the simple stitching of her dark low-cut dress, told more of God and Divinity.\n But her greatest adornment in these moments was the tearful and eager love for him, her lack of fear of his mutilated face, the grace of her white arms as she enclosed him again, so sure of herself and so grateful for the gentle yielding of his body in towards her. I was so thankful that she loved him.\n \"So the Prince of Lies had a tale to tell, did he?\" she asked. She could not kill the quaver in her voice. \"So he\u0027s taken you to his Hell and sent you back?\" She took Lestat\u0027s face in her hands and turned it towards her. \"Then tell us what it was, this Hell, tell us why we must be afraid. Tell us why you are afraid, but I think it\u0027s something far worse than fear that I see now in you.\"\n He nodded his head to say that it was. He pushed back the Chinese chair, and wringing his hands he began to pace, the inevitable prelude to his tale telling.\n \"Listen to all I say, before you judge,\" he declared, fixing us now, the three who crowded about the table, an anxious little audience willing to do whatever he asked of us. His eyes lingered on you, David, you, the English scholar in your manly tweed, who in spite of love abundantly clear beheld him with a critical eye, ready to evaluate his words with a wisdom natural to you.\n He began to talk. Hour by hour he talked. Hour by hour the words streamed out of him, heated and rushing and sometimes tumbling over one another so that he had to stop and catch his breath, but he never really paused, as he poured it out over the long night, this tale of his adventure.\n Yes, Memnoch the Devil had taken him to Hell, but it was a Hell of Memnoch\u0027s devising, a Purgatorial place in which the souls of all who had ever lived were welcome to come of their own accord from the whirlwind of death which had inherited them. And in that Purgatorial Hell, confronted with all the deeds they\u0027d ever done, they learnt the most hideous lesson of all, the endless consequences of every action ever committed by them. Murderer and Mother alike, vagrant children slaughtered in seeming innocence and soldiers bathed in blood from battlefields, all were admitted to this awful place of smoke and sulfurous fire, but only to see the gaping wounds in others made by their wrathful or unwitting hands, to plumb the depths of other souls and hearts which they had injured!\n All horror was an illusion in this place, but the worst horror of all was the person of God Incarnate, who had allowed this Final School for those who would be worthy to enter His Paradise. And, this too Lestat had seen, the Heaven glimpsed a million times by saints and deathbed victims, of ever blooming trees and flowers eternally sweet and endless crystal towers of happy, happy beings, shorn of all flesh and one at last with countless choirs of singing angels.\n It was an old tale. It was too old. It had been told too many times, this tale-of Heaven with her open gates, and God Our Maker sending forth His endless light to those who climbed the mythic stairs to join the celestial court forever.\n How many mortals waking from a near death sleep have struggled to describe these same wonders!\n How many saints have claimed to have glimpsed this indescribable and eternal Eden?\n And how cleverly this Devil Memnoch had laid out his case to plead for mortal compassion for his sin, that he and he alone had opposed a merciless and indifferent God, to beg that Deity to look down with compassionate eyes on a fleshly race of beings who had by means of their own selfless love managed to engender souls worthy of His interest?\n This, then, was the fall of Lucifer like the Star of Morning from the sky-an angel begging for the Sons and Daughters of Men that they had now the countenances and hearts of angels.\n \"Give them Paradise, Lord, give it to them when they have learnt in my school how to love all that you have created.\"\n Oh, a book has been filled with this adventure. Memnoch the Devil cannot be condensed here in these few unjust paragraphs.\n But this was the sum of what fell on my ears as I sat in this chilly New York room, gazing now and then past Lestat\u0027s frantic, pacing figure at the white sky of ever falling snow, shutting out beneath his roaring narrative the rumble of the city far below, and struggling with the awful fear in myself that I must at the climax of his tale disappoint him. That I must remind him that he had done no more than shape the mystic journey of a thousand saints in a new and palatable fashion.\n So it is a school that replaces those rings of eternal fire which the poet Dante described in such degree as to sicken the reader, and even the tender Fra Angelico felt compelled to paint, where naked mortals bathed in flame were meant to suffer for eternity.\n A school, a place of hope, a promise of redemption great enough perhaps to welcome even us, the Children of the Night, who counted murders among their sins as numerous as those of ancient Huns or Mongols.\n Oh, this was very sweet, this picture of the life hereafter, the horrors of the natural world laid off upon a wise but distant God, and the Devil\u0027s folly rendered with such keen intelligence.\n Would that it were true, would that all the poems and paintings of the world were but a mirror of such hopeful splendor.\n It might have saddened me; it might have broken me down to where I hung my head and couldn\u0027t look at him.\n But a single incident from his tale, one which to him had been a passing encounter, loomed large for me beyond all the rest and locked itself to my thoughts, so that as he went on and on, I couldn\u0027t banish this from my mind: that he, Lestat, had drunk the very blood of Christ on the road to Calvary. That he, Lestat, had spoken to this God Incarnate, who by His own will had walked towards this horrible Death on Golgotha. That he, Lestat, a fearful and trembling witness had been made to stand in the narrow dusty streets of ancient Jerusalem to see Our Lord pass, and that this Lord, Our Living Lord, had, with the crossbeam of the crucifix strapped to His shoulders, offered His throat to Lestat, the chosen pupil.\n Ah, such fancy, this madness, such fancy. I had not expected to be so hurt by anything in this tale. I had not expected this to make a burning in my chest, a tightness in my throat from which no words could escape. I had not wanted this. The only salvation of my wounded heart was to think how quaint and foolish it was that such a tableau- Jerusalem, the dusty street, the angry crowds, the bleeding God, now scourged and limping beneath His wooden weight-should include a legend old and sweet of a woman with a Veil outstretched to wipe the bloody Face of Christ in comfort, and thereby to receive for all time His Image.\n It does not take a scholar, David, to know such saints were made by other saints in centuries to come as actors and actresses chosen for a Passion Play in a country village. Veronica! Veronica, whose very name means True Ikon.\n And our hero, our Lestat, our Prometheus, with that Veil given him by the very hand of God, had fled this great and ghastly realm of Heaven and Hell and the Stations of the Cross, crying No! and I will not! and come back, breathless, running like a madman through the snows of New York, seeking only to be with us, turning his back on all of it.\n My head swam. There was a war inside of me. I couldn\u0027t look at him.\n On and on he went, going over it, talking again of the sapphiric Heavens and the angels\u0027 song, arguing with himself and with you and with Dora, and the conversation seemed like so much shattered glass. I couldn\u0027t bear it.\n The Blood of Christ inside him? The Blood of Christ passing his lips, his unclean lips, his Undead lips, the Blood of Christ making of him a monstrous Ciborium? The Blood of Christ?\n \"Let me drink!\" I cried out suddenly. \"Lestat, let me drink, from you, let me drink your blood that has His blood inside it!\" I couldn\u0027t believe my own earnestness, my own wild desperation. \"Lestat, let me drink. Let me look for the blood with my tongue and my heart. Let me drink, please; you can\u0027t deny me that one moment of intimacy. And if it was Christ... if it was ...\" I couldn\u0027t finish it.\n \"Oh, mad and foolish child,\" he said. \"All you\u0027ll know if you sink your teeth into me is what we learn from the visions we see with all our victims. You\u0027ll learn what I think I saw. You\u0027ll learn what I think was made known to me. You\u0027ll learn that my blood runs in my veins, which you know now. You\u0027ll learn that I believe it was Christ, but no more than that.\"\n He shook his head in disappointment as he glared at me.\n \"No, I\u0027ll know,\" I said. I rose from the table, my hands quivering. \"Lestat, give me this one embrace and I\u0027ll never ask another thing of you for all eternity. Let me put my lips to your throat, Lestat, let me test the tale, let me do it!\"\n \"You break my heart, you little fool,\" he said with tears welling. \"You always did.\"\n \"Don\u0027t judge me!\" I cried.\n He went on, speaking to me alone, from his mind as much as with his voice. I couldn\u0027t tell if anyone else there could even hear him. But I heard him. I would not forget a single word.\n \"And what if it was the Blood of God, Armand,\" he asked, \"and not part and parcel of some titanic lie, what would you find in me? Go out to the early morning Mass and snatch your victims from those just come from the Communion Rail! What a pretty game that would be, Armand, to feed forever only on Holy Communicants! You can have your Blood of Christ from any one of them. I tell you, I do not believe these spirits, God, Memnoch, these liars; I tell you, I refuse! I wouldn\u0027t stay, I fled their damned school, I lost my eye as I battled them, they snatched it from me, wicked angels clawing at me when I ran away from them! You want the Blood of Christ, then go down now in the dark church to the fisherman\u0027s Mass and knock the sleepy priest aside from the Altar, if you will, and grab the Chalice from his consecrated hands. Go ahead, do it!\n \"Blood of Christ!\" he continued, his face one great eye fixing me in its merciless beam. \"If it was ever in me, this sacred blood, then my body has dissolved it and burnt it up like candle wax devours the wick. You know this. What\u0027s left of Christ in the belly of His faithful when they leave the church?\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"No, but we are not humans!\" I whispered, seeking somehow in softness to drown out his angry vehemence. \"Lestat, I\u0027ll know! It was His blood, not transubstantiated bread and wine! His blood, Lestat, and I\u0027ll know if it\u0027s inside of you. Oh, let me drink, I beg you. Let me drink so I can forget every damned thing you\u0027ve told us, let me drink!\"\n I could scarcely keep myself from laying hands on him, from forcing him to my will, never mind his legendary strength, his gruesome temper. I\u0027d lay hold of him and make him submit. I\u0027d take the blood-.\n But these thoughts were foolish and vain. His whole tale was foolish and vain, and yet I turned around, and in a fury I spit the words at him:\n \"Why didn\u0027t you accept? Why didn\u0027t you go with Memnoch if he could have taken you from this awful living Hell we share, why didn\u0027t you?\"\n \"They let you escape,\" you said to him, David. You broke in, quieting me with a small pleading gesture of your left hand.\n But I had no patience for analysis or inevitable interpretation. I couldn\u0027t get the image out of my mind, Our Bloody Lord, Our Lord with the crossbeam bound to His shoulders, and she, Veronica, this sweet figment with the Veil in her hands. Oh, how is it such a fantasy could get its hook so deep?\n \"Back away from me, all of you,\" he cried. \"I have the Veil. I told you. Christ gave it to me. Veronica gave it to me. I took it with me out of Memnoch\u0027s Hell, when all his imps tried to take it from me.\"\n I scarcely heard. Veil, the actual Veil, what trick is this? My head ached. The fisherman\u0027s Mass. If there was such a thing in St. Patrick\u0027s below, I wanted to go there. I was weary of this glass-walled tower room, cut off from the taste of the wind and the wild refreshing wetness of the snow.\n Why did Lestat back up against the wall? What did he take out of his coat? The Veil! Some gaudy trick to seal this whole masterpiece of mayhem?\n I looked up, my eyes roaming over the snowy night beyond the glass and only slowly finding their mark: the opened cloth which he held up in his hands, his own head bowed, the cloth revealed as reverently as it might have been by Veronica.\n \"My Lord!\" I whispered. All the world was gone in curls of weightless sound and light. I saw Him there. \"My Lord.\" I saw His Face, not painted, printed or otherwise daintily tricked into the tiny fibers of the fine white cloth, but blazing with a flame that would not consume the vehicle that bore the heat of it. My Lord, my Lord the Man, my Lord, my Christ, the Man with black and sharpened crown of thorns, and long twisted brown hair so fearfully clotted with blood, and great wondering dark eyes that stared straight at me, the sweet and vivid portals of the Soul of God, so radiant their immeasurable love that all poetry dies before it, and a soft and silken mouth of unquestioning and unjudging simplicity, open to take a silent and agonizing breath at the very moment the Veil had come to soothe this hideous suffering.\n I wept. I clamped my hand to my mouth, but I couldn\u0027t stop my words.\n \"Oh, Christ, my tragic Christ!\" I whispered. \"Not made by human hands!\" I cried out. \"Not made by human hands!\" How wretched my words, how feeble, how filled with sorrow. \"This Man\u0027s Face, this Face of God and Man. He bleeds. For the love of Almighty God, look at it!\"\n But not a sound had come from me. I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t breathe. I\u0027d fallen down on my knees in my shock and in my helplessness. I never wanted to take my eyes from it. I never wanted anything anymore again ever. I wanted only to look at it. I wanted only to look at Him, and I saw Him, and I saw back, back over the centuries, back to His Face in the light of the earthen lamp burning in the house in Podil, His Face gazing at me from the panel between my quivering fingers amid the candles of the Scriptorium of the Monastery of the Caves, His Face as I had never seen it on those glorious walls of Venice or Florence where I had for so long and so desperately sought it.\n His Face, His manly Face infused with the Divine, my tragic Lord gazing at me from my Mother\u0027s arms in the frozen sludge of the long-ago street of Podil, my loving Lord in bloody Majesty.\n I didn\u0027t care what Dora said.\n I didn\u0027t care that she screamed His Holy Name. I didn\u0027t care. I knew.\n And as she declared her faith, as she snatched the Veil from Lestat\u0027s very hands and ran with it out of this apartment, I followed, moving after her and after the Veil-though in the sanctuary of my heart I never moved.\n I never stirred.\n A great stillness had overtaken my mind, and my limbs no longer mattered.\n It did not matter that Lestat fought with her, and cautioned her that she must not believe this thing, and that the three of us stood on the steps of the Cathedral and that the snow fell like some splendid blessing from the invisible and fathomless Heavens.\n It did not matter that the sun was soon to rise, a fiery silver ball beyond the canopy of melting clouds.\n I could die now.\n I had seen Him, and all the rest-the words of Memnoch and his fanciful God, the pleas of Lestat that we come away, that we hide ourselves before the morning devoured us all-it did not matter.\n I could die now.\n \"Not made by human hands,\" I whispered.\n A crowd gathered around us at the doors. The warm air came out of the church in a deep delicious gust. It didn\u0027t matter.\n \"The Veil, the Veil,\" they cried. They saw! They saw His Face.\n Lestat\u0027s desperate imploring cries were dying away.\n The morning came down in its thunderous white-hot light, rolling over roofs and curdling the night in a thousand glassy walls and slowly unleashing its monstrous glory.\n \"Bear witness,\" I said. I held up my open arms to the blinding light, this molten silvery death. \"This sinner dies for Him! This sinner goes to Him.\"\n Cast me into Hell, Oh Lord, if that is Your will. You have given me Heaven. You have shown me Your Face.\n And Your Face was human. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6/page-18.html","bookId":2214,"book":{"id":2214,"title":"The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6) \n Armand until now has played a small role in the Vampire Chronicles.
