{"id":103068,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"PART III APPASSIONATA 17 I DIDN\u0027T WANT to go to him. It was winter, and I was contented in London, haunting the theatres to see the plays of Shakespeare, and reading the plays and the sonnets the whole night long. I had no other thoughts just now but Shakespeare. Lestat had given him to me. And when I\u0027d had a bellyful of despair, I\u0027d opened the books and begun to read. But Lestat was calling. Lestat was, or so he claimed, afraid. I had to go. The last time he\u0027d been in trouble, I hadn\u0027t been free to rush to his rescue. There is a story to that, but nothing as important as this one which I tell now. Now I knew that my hard-won peace of mind might be shattered by the mere contact with him, but he wanted me to come, so I went. I found him first in New York, though he didn\u0027t know it and he couldn\u0027t have led me into a worse snowstorm if he\u0027d tried. He slew a mortal that night, a victim with whom he\u0027d fallen in love, as was his custom of late-to pick these celebrities of high crimes and horrid murders-and to stalk them before the night of the feast. So what did he want of me, I wondered. You were there, David. You could help him. Or so it seemed. Being his fledgling you hadn\u0027t heard his call directly, but he\u0027d reached you somehow, and the two of you, such proper gentlemen, came together to discuss in low, sophisticated whispers Lestat\u0027s latest fears. When next I caught up with him he was in New Orleans. And he put it to me plain and simple. You were there. The Devil had come to him in the guise of a man. The Devil could change shapes, being at one moment horrific and ghastly with webbed wings and hoofed feet; and then next, the Devil could be an ordinary man. Lestat was wild with these stories. The Devil had offered him a dreadful proposition, that he, Lestat, become the Devil\u0027s helper in the service of God. Do you remember how calmly I responded to his story, his questions, his pleading for our advice? Oh, I told him firmly it was madness to follow this spirit, to believe that any discarnate thing was bound to tell him the truth. But only now do you know the wounds he opened with this strange and marvelous fable. So the Devil would make him a hellish helper and thereby a servant of God? I might have laughed outright, or wept, throwing it in his face that I had once believed myself a saint of evil, shivering in rags as I stalked my victims in the Parisian winter, all for the honor and glory of God. But he knew all this. There was no need to wound him farther, to shift from him the limelight of his own tale, which Lestat, being the bright star, must always have. Under moss-hung oaks we talked in civilized voices. You and I begged him to be cautious. Naturally, he ignored all we said. It was all mixed up with the entrancing mortal Dora, who was living then in this very building, this old brick convent, the daughter of the man Lestat had stalked and slain. When he bound us to look out for her, I was angry, but only mildly so. I have fallen in love with mortals. I have those tales to tell. I am in love now with Sybelle and Benjamin, whom I call my children, and I had been a secret troubadour to other mortals in the dim past. All right, he was in love with Dora, he\u0027d laid his head on a mortal breast, he wanted the womb blood of her that would be no loss to her, he was smitten, crazed, goaded by the ghost of her Father and courted by the Prince of Evil Himself. And she, what shall I say of her? That she possessed the power of a Rasputin behind the face of a nunnery postulant, when in fact she is a practiced theologian and not a mystic, a ranting raving leader, not a visionary, whose ecclesiastical ambitions would have dwarfed those of Saints Peter and Paul put together, and that of course, she is like any flower Lestat ever gathered from the Savage Garden of this world: a most fine and fetching little creature, a glorious specimen of God\u0027s Creation-with raven hair, a pouty mouth, cheeks of porcelain and the dashing limbs of a nymph. Of course I knew the very moment that he left this world. I felt it. I was in New York already, very near to him and aware that you were there as well. Neither of us meant to let him out of our sight if at all possible. Then came the moment when he vanished in the blizzard, when he was sucked out of the earthly atmosphere as if he\u0027d never been there. Being his fledgling you couldn\u0027t hear the perfect silence that descended when he vanished. You couldn\u0027t know how completely he\u0027d been withdrawn from all things minuscule yet material which had once echoed with the beating of his heart. I knew, and I think it was to distract us both that I proposed we go to the wounded mortal who must have been shattered by her Father\u0027s death at the hands of a blond-haired handsome blood-swilling monster who\u0027d made her his confidant and a friend. It was not difficult to help her in the short event-filled nights that followed, when horror was heaped upon horror, her Father\u0027s murder discovered, his sordid life at once made by media magic the madcap conversation of the wide world. It seems a century ago, not merely so short a time, that we moved south to these rooms, her father\u0027s legacy of crucifixes and statues, of ikons which I handled so coolly as if I\u0027d never loved such treasures at all. It seems a century ago that I dressed decently for her, finding in some fashionable Fifth Avenue shop a shapely coat of old red velvet, a poet\u0027s shirt, as they call it now, of starched cotton and ample flopping lace, and to set this off, pegged-leg trousers of black wool and shiny boots that buckled at the ankle, all this the better to accompany her to identify her Father\u0027s severed head under the leeching fluorescent lights of some immense and overcrowded morgue. One good thing about this final decade of the twentieth century is that a man of any age can wear his hair at any length. It seems a century ago that I combed out mine, full and curly and clean for once, just for her. It seems a century ago we stood so staunchly beside her, indeed even held her, this long-necked, short-haired, spellbinding witchlet, in our very arms as she wept over the death of her Father and pelted us with feverish and maniacally intelligent and dispassionate questions about our sinister nature, as if a great crash course in the anatomy of the vampire could somehow close the cycle of horror threatening her wholesomeness and her sanity and somehow bring her wicked conscienceless Father back. No, it wasn\u0027t the return of Roger, actually, that she prayed for; she believed too totally in the omniscience and mercy of God. Besides, seeing a man\u0027s severed head is a bit of a shock, even if the head is frozen, and a dog had chomped on Roger a bit before he\u0027d been discovered, and what with the strict \"no touch\" rules of modern forensics, he was-for me even-quite a sight. (I remember the coroner\u0027s assistant saying soulfully to me that I was awfully young to have to see such a thing. She thought I was Dora\u0027s little brother. What a sweet woman she was. Perhaps it\u0027s worth it to make a foray into the official mortal world once in a while in order to be called \"a real trouper\" instead of a Botticelli angel, which has become my tag line among the Undead.) It was the return of Lestat Dora dreamed of. What else would ever allow her to break free of our enchantment but some final blessing from the crowned prince himself? I stood at the dark glass windows of the high-rise apartment, looking out over the deep snows of Fifth Avenue, waiting and praying with her, wishing the great Earth were not so empty of my old enemy and thinking in my foolish heart that in time this mystery of his disappearance would be resolved, as were all miracles, with sadness and small losses, with no more than little revelations that would leave me as I had always been left since that long-ago night in Venice when my Master and I were divided forever, simply a little more clever at pretending that I was still alive. I didn\u0027t fear for Lestat, not really. I had no hopes for his adventure, except that he would appear sooner or later and tell us some fantastical yarn. It would be regular Lestat talk, for nobody aggrandizes as he does his preposterous adventures. This is not to say that he hasn\u0027t switched bodies with a human. I know that he has. This is not to say that he didn\u0027t wake our fearsome goddess Mother, Akasha; I know that he did. This is not to say that he didn\u0027t smash my old superstitious Coven to bits and pieces in the garish years before the French Revolution. I\u0027ve already told you so. But it\u0027s the way he describes things that happen to him that maddens me, the way that he connects one incident to another as though all these random and grisly occurrences were in fact links in some significant chain. They are not. They are capers. And he knows it. But he must make a gutter theatrical out of stubbing his toe. The James Bond of the Vampires, the Sam Spade of his own pages! A rock singer wailing on a mortal stage for all of two hours and, on the strength of that, retiring with a slew of recordings that feed him filthy lucre still from human agencies to this very night. He has a knack for making tragedy of tribulation, and forgiving himself for anything and everything in every confessional paragraph he pens. I can\u0027t fault him, really. I cannot help but hate it that he lies now in a coma on the floor of his chapel here, staring into a self-contained silence, despite the fledglings that circle him-for precisely the same reason as I did, to see for themselves if the blood of Christ has transformed him somehow and he does not represent some magnificent manifestation of the miracle of the Transubstantiation. But I\u0027ll come to that soon enough. I\u0027ve ranted myself into a little corner. I know why I resent him so, and find it so soothing to hammer at his reputation, to beat upon his immensity with both my fists. He has taught me too much. He has brought me to this very moment, here, where I stand dictating to you my past with a coherence and calm that would have been impossible before I came to his assistance with his precious Memnoch the Devil and his vulnerable little Dora. Two hundred years ago he stripped me of illusions, lies, excuses, and thrust me on the Paris pavements naked to find my way back to a glory in the starlight that I had once known and too painfully lost. But as we waited finally in the handsome high-rise apartment above St. Patrick\u0027s Cathedral, I had no idea how much more he could strip from me, and I hate him only because I cannot imagine my soul without him now, and, owing him all that I am and know, I can do nothing to make him wake from his frigid sleep. But let me take things one at a time. What good is it to go back down now to the chapel here and lay my hands on him again and beg him to listen to me, when he lies as though all sense has truly left him and will never return. I can\u0027t accept this. I won\u0027t. I\u0027ve lost all patience; I\u0027ve lost the numbness that was my consolation. I find this moment intolerable-. But I have to tell you things. I have to tell you what happened when I saw the Veil, and when the sun struck me and, more wretchedly for me, what I saw when finally I reached Lestat and drew so close to him that I could drink his blood. Yes, stay on course. I know now why he makes the chain. It isn\u0027t pride, is it? It\u0027s the necessity. The tale can\u0027t be told without one link being connected to the other, and we poor orphans of ticking time know no other means of measure but those of sequence. Dropped into the snowy blackness, into a world worse than a void, I reached for a chain, did I not? Oh, God, what I would have given in that awful descent to grasp the firmness of a metal chain! He came back so suddenly-to you and Dora and me. It was the third morning, and not long enough before dawn. I heard the doors slam far below us in the glass tower, and then that sound, that sound which gains in eerie volume each year, the beating of his heart. Who was first to rise from the table? I was still with fear. He came too fast, and there were those wild fragrances whirling about him, of woodland and raw earth. He crashed through all barriers as if he were pursued by those who\u0027d stolen him away, and yet there was no one behind him. He came alone into the apartment, slamming the door in his wake and then standing before us, more horrible than I could ever have imagined, more ruined than I had ever seen him in any of his former little defeats. With absolute love Dora ran to him, and in a desperate need that was all too human he clutched at her so fiercely that I thought he would destroy her. \"You\u0027re safe now, darling,\" she cried, struggling so as to make him understand. But we had only to look at him to know it wasn\u0027t finished, though we murmured the same hollow words in the face of what we beheld.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6/page-17.html","bookId":2214,"book":{"id":2214,"title":"The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6) Armand until now has played a small role in the Vampire Chronicles. Here he assumes center stage, relating his five hundred years of life to fledgling vampire David Talbot, who plays amanuensis to Armand as he did to Lestat ...

Rice is equally effective in showing how Armand eventually loses his religion and becomes \"the vagabond angel child of Satan,\" living under Paris cemeteries and foundling the Grand Guignol-ish Theatre des Vampires. In the twentieth century, a rehabilitated Armand regains faith but falls in love with two children who save his life.
