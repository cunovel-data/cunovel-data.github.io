{"id":103076,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"25\n THIS IS NO EPILOGUE. It is the last chapter to a tale I thought was finished. I write it in my own hand. It will be brief, for I have no drama left me and must manipulate with the utmost care the bare bones of the tale.\n Perhaps in some later time the proper words will come to me to deepen my depiction of what happened, but for now to record is all that I can do.\n I did not leave the convent after I inscribed my name to the copy which David had so faithfully written out. It was too late.\n The night had spent itself in language, and I had to retire to one of the secret brick chambers of the place which David showed me, a place where Lestat had once been imprisoned, and there sprawled on the floor in perfect darkness, overexcited by all that I\u0027d told David, and, more completely exhausted than I\u0027d ever been, I went into immediate sleep with the rise of the sun.\n At twilight, I rose, straightened out my clothes and returned to the chapel. I knelt down and gave Lestat a kiss of unreserved affection, just as I had the night before. I took no notice of anyone and did not even know who was there.\n Taking Marius at his word, I walked away from the convent, in a wash of early evening violet light, my eyes drifting trustingly over the flowers, and I listened for the chords of Sybelle\u0027s Sonata to lead me to the proper house.\n Within seconds I heard the music, the distant but rapid phrases of the Allegro assai, or the First Movement, of Sybelle\u0027s familiar song.\n It was played with an unusual ringing preciseness, indeed, a new languid cadence which gave it a powerful and ruby-red authority which I immediately loved.\n So I hadn\u0027t scared my little girl out of her mind. She was well and prospering and perhaps falling in love with the drowsy humid loveliness of New Orleans as so many of us have.\n I sped at once to the location, and found myself standing, only a little mussed by the wind, in front of a huge three-story redbrick house in Metairie, a countrified suburb of New Orleans which is actually very close to the city, with a feel that can be miraculously remote.\n The giant oaks which Marius described were all around this new American mansion, and, as he had promised, all his French doors of shining clean panes were open to the early breeze.\n The grass was long and soft beneath my shoes, and a splendid light, so very precious to Marius, poured forth from every window as did the music of the Appassionata now, which was just moving with exceptional grace into the Second Movement, Andante con motto, which promises to be a tame segment of the work but quickly works itself into the same madness as all the rest.\n I stopped in my tracks to listen to it. I had never heard the notes quite as limpid and translucent, quite as flashing and exquisitely distinct. I tried for sheer pleasure to divine the differences between this performance and so many I\u0027d heard in the past. They were all different, magical and profoundly affecting, but this was passing spectacular, helped in slight measure by the immense body of what I knew to be a concert grand.\n For a moment, a misery swept over me, a terrible, gripping memory of what I\u0027d seen when I drank Lestat\u0027s blood the night before. I let myself relive it, as we say so innocently, and then with a positive blush of pleasant shock, I realized that I didn\u0027t have to tell anyone about it, that it was all dictated to David and that when he gave me my copies, I could entrust them to whomever I loved, who would ever want to know what I\u0027d seen.\n As for myself, I wouldn\u0027t try to figure it out. I couldn\u0027t. The feeling was too strong that whom I had seen on the road to Calvary, whether He was real or a figment of my own guilty heart, had not wanted me to see Him and had monstrously turned me away. Indeed the feeling of rejection was so total that I could scarce believe that I had managed to describe it to David.\n I had to get the thoughts out of my mind. I banished all reverberations of this experience and let myself fall into Sybelle\u0027s music again, merely standing under the oaks, with the eternal river breeze, which can reach you anywhere in this place, cooling me and soothing me and making me feel that the Earth itself was filled with irrepressible beauty, even for someone such as I.\n The music of the Third Movement built to its most brilliant climax, and I thought my heart would break.\n It was only then, as the final bars were played out, that I realized something which should have been obvious to me from the start.\n It wasn\u0027t Sybelle playing this music. It couldn\u0027t be. I knew every nuance of Sybelle\u0027s interpretations. I knew her modes of expression; I knew the tonal qualities that her particular touch invariably produced. Though her interpretations were infinitely spontaneous, nevertheless I knew her music, as one knows the writing of another or the style of a painter\u0027s work. This wasn\u0027t Sybelle.\n And then the real truth dawned on me. It was Sybelle, but Sybelle was no longer Sybelle.\n For a second I couldn\u0027t believe it. My heart stopped in my chest.\n Then I walked into the house, a steady furious walk that would have stopped for nothing but to find the truth of what I believed.\n In an instant I saw it with my own eyes. In a splendid room, they were gathered together, the beautiful lithe figure of Pandora in a gown of brown silk, girdled at the waist in the old Grecian style, Marius in a light velvet smoking jacket over silk trousers, and my children, my beautiful children, radiant Benji in his white gown, dancing barefoot and wildly around the room with his fingers flung out as if to grasp the air in them, and Sybelle, my gorgeous Sybelle, with her arms bare too in a dress of deep rose silk, at the piano, her long hair swept back over her shoulders, just striding into the First Movement again.\n All of them vampires, every one.\n I clenched my teeth hard, and covered my mouth lest my roars wake the world. I roared and roared into my collapsed hands.\n I cried out the single defiant syllable No, No, No, over and over again. I could say nothing else, scream nothing else, do nothing else.\n I cried and cried.\n I bit down so hard with my teeth that my jaw ached, and my hands shuddered like wings of a bird that wouldn\u0027t let me shut up my mouth tight enough, and once again the tears streamed out of my eyes as thickly as they had when I kissed Lestat.\n No, No, No, No!\n Then suddenly I flung out my hands, coiling them into fists, and the roar would have got loose, it would have burst from me like a raging stream, but Marius took hold of me with great force and flung me against his chest and buried my face against himself.\n I struggled to get free. I kicked at him with all of my strength, and I beat at him with my fists.\n \"How could you do it!\" I roared.\n His hands enclosed my head in a hopeless trap, and his lips kept covering me with kisses I hated and detested and fought off with desperate flinging gestures.\n \"How could you? How dare you? How could you?\"\n At last I gained enough leverage to smash his face with blow after blow.\n But what good did it do me? How weak and meaningless were my fists against his strength. How helpless and foolish and small were my gestures, and he stood there, bearing it all, his face unspeakably sad, and his own eyes dry yet full of caring.\n \"How could you do it, how could you do it!\" I demanded. I would not cease.\n But suddenly Sybelle rose from the piano, and with her arms out ran to me. And Benji, who had been watching all the while, rushed to me also, and they imprisoned me gently in their tender arms.\n \"Oh, Armand, don\u0027t be angry, don\u0027t be, don\u0027t be sad,\" Sybelle cried softly against my ear. \"Oh, my magnificent Armand, don\u0027t be sad, don\u0027t be. Don\u0027t be cross. We\u0027re with you forever.\"\n \"Armand, we are with you! He did the magic,\" cried Benji. \"We didn\u0027t have to be born from black eggs, you Dybbuk, to tell us such a tale! Armand, we will never die now, we will never be sick, and never hurt and never afraid again.\" He jumped up and down with glee and spun in another mirthful circle, astonished and laughing at his new vigor, that he could leap so high and with such grace. \"Armand, we are so happy.\"\n \"Oh, yes, please,\" cried Sybelle softly in her deeper gentler voice. \"I love you so much, Armand, I love you so very very much. We had to do it. We had to. We had to do it, to always and forever be with you.\"\n My fingers hovered about her, wanting to comfort her, and then, as she ground her forehead desperately into my neck, hugging me tight around the chest, I couldn\u0027t not touch her, couldn\u0027t not embrace her, couldn\u0027t not assure her.\n \"Armand, I love you, I adore you, Armand, I live only for you, and now with you always,\" she said.\n I nodded, I tried to speak. She kissed my tears. She began to kiss them rapidly and desperately. \"Stop it, stop crying, don\u0027t cry,\" she kept saying in her urgent low whisper. \"Armand, we love you.\"\n \"Armand, we are so happy!\" cried Benji. \"Look, Armand, look! We can dance together now to her music. We can do everything together. Armand, we have hunted already.\" He dashed up to me and bent his knees, poised to spring with excitement as if to emphasize his point. Then he sighed and flung out his arms to me again, \"Ah, poor Armand, you are all wrong, all filled with wrong dreams. Armand, don\u0027t you see?\"\n \"I love you,\" I whispered in a tiny voice into Sybelle\u0027s ear. I whispered it again, and then my resistance broke completely, and I crushed her gently to me and with rampant fingers felt her silky white skin and the zinging fineness of her shining hair.\n Still holding her to me, I whispered, \"Don\u0027t tremble, I love you, I love you.\"\n I clasped Benji to me with my left hand. \"And you, scamp, you can tell me all of it in time. Just let me hold you now. Let me hold you.\"\n I was shivering. I was the one shivering. They enclosed me again with all their tenderness, seeking to keep me warm.\n Finally, patting them both, taking my leave of them with kisses, I shrank away and fell down exhausted into a large old velvet chair.\n My head throbbed and I felt my tears coming again, but with all my force I swallowed my tears for their sake. I had no choice.\n Sybelle had gone back to the piano, and striking the keys she began the Sonata again. This time she sang out the notes in a beautiful low monosyllabic soprano, and Benji began dancing again, whirling, and prancing, and stomping with his bare feet, in lovely keeping with Sybelle\u0027s time.\n I sat forward with my head in my hands. I wanted my hair to come down and hide me from all eyes, but for all its thickness it was only a head of hair.\n I felt a hand on my shoulder and I stiffened, but I could not say a word, lest I\u0027d start crying again and cursing with all my might. I was silent.\n \"I don\u0027t expect you to understand,\" he said under his breath.\n I sat up. He was beside me, seated on the arm of the chair. He looked down at me.\n I made my face pleasant, all smiles even, and my voice so velvet and placid that no one could have thought I was talking to him of anything but love.\n \"How could you do it? Why did you do it? Do you hate me so much? Don\u0027t lie to me. Don\u0027t tell me stupid things that you know I will never, never believe. Don\u0027t lie to me for Pandora\u0027s sake or their sake. I\u0027ll care for them and love them forever. But don\u0027t lie. You did it for vengeance, didn\u0027t you, Master, you did it for hate?\"\n \"How could I?\" he asked in the same voice, expressive of pure love, and it seemed the very genuine voice of love talking to me from his sincere and pleading face. \"If ever I did anything for love, I have done this for it. I did it for love and for you. I did it for all the wrongs done you, and the loneliness you\u0027ve suffered, and the horrors that the world put upon you when you were too young and too untried to know how to fight them and then too vanquished to wage a battle with a full heart. I did it for you.\"\n \"Oh, you lie, you lie in your heart,\" I said, \"if not with your tongue. You did it for spite, and you have just revealed it all too plainly to me. You did it for spite because I wasn\u0027t the fledgling you wanted to make of me. I wasn\u0027t the clever rebel who could stand up to Santino and his band of monsters, and I was the one, after all those centuries, that disappointed you yet again and horribly because I went into the sun after I saw the Veil. That\u0027s why you did it. You did it for vengeance and you did it for bitterness and you did it for disappointment, and the crowning horror is you don\u0027t know it yourself. You couldn\u0027t bear it that my heart swelled to burst when I saw His Face on the Veil. You couldn\u0027t bear it that this child you plucked from the Venetian brothel, and nursed with your own blood, this child you taught from your own books and with your hands, cried out to Him when he saw His Face on the Veil.\"\n \"No, that is so very very far from the truth it breaks my heart.\" He shook his head. And tearless and white as he was, his face was a perfect picture of sorrow as though it was a painting he had done with his own hands. \"I did it because they love you as no one has ever loved you, and they are free and have within their generous hearts a deep cunning which doesn\u0027t shrink from you and all that you are. I did it because they were forged in the same furnace as myself, the two of them, keen to reason and strong to endure. I did it because madness had not defeated her, and poverty and ignorance had not defeated him. I did it because they were your chosen ones, utterly perfect, and I knew that you would not do it, and they would come to hate you for this, hate you, as you once hated me for withholding it, and you would lose them to alienation and death before you would give in.\n \"They are yours now. Nothing separates you. And it\u0027s my blood, ancient and powerful, that\u0027s filled them to the brim with power so that they can be your worthy companions and not the pale shadow of your soul which Louis always was.\n \"There is no barrier of Master and Fledgling between you, and you can learn the secrets of their hearts as they learn the secrets of yours.\"\n I wanted to believe it.\n I wanted to believe it so badly that I got up and left him, and making the gentlest smile at my Benjamin and kissing her silkily in passing, I withdrew to the garden and stood alone beneath and between a pair of massive oaks.\n Their thunderous roots rose up out of the ground, forming hillocks of hard dark blistering wood. I rested my feet in this rocky place and my head against the nearer of the two trees.\n The branches came down and made a veil for me, as I had wanted the hair of my own head to do. I felt shielded and safe in the shadows. I was quiet in my heart, but my heart was broken and my mind was shattered, and I had only to look through the open doorway into the brilliant glory of the light at my two white vampire angels for me to start crying again.\n Marius stood for a long time in a distant door. He didn\u0027t look at me. And when I looked to Pandora, I saw her coiled up as if to defend herself from some terrible pain-possibly only our quarrel-in another large old velvet chair.\n Finally Marius drew himself up and came towards me, and I think it took a force of will for him to do it. He seemed suddenly just a little angry and even proud.\n I didn\u0027t give a damn.\n He stood before me but he said nothing, and it seemed he was there to face whatever I had yet to say.\n \"Why didn\u0027t you let them have their lives!\" I said. \"You, of all people, whatever you felt for me and my follies, why didn\u0027t you let them have what nature gave them? Why did you interfere?\"\n He didn\u0027t answer, but I didn\u0027t allow for it. Softening my tone so as not to alarm them, I went on.\n \"In my darkest times,\" I said, \"it was always your words that upheld me. Oh, I don\u0027t mean during those centuries when I was in bondage to a warped creed and morbid delusion. I mean long afterwards, after I had come out of the cellar, at Lestat\u0027s challenge, and I read what Lestat wrote of you, and then heard you for myself. It was you, Master, who let me see what little I could of the marvelous bright world unfolding around me in ways I couldn\u0027t have imagined in the land or time in which I was born.\"\n I couldn\u0027t contain myself. I stopped for breath and to listen to her music, and realizing how lovely it was, how plaintive and expressive and newly mysterious, I almost cried again. But I couldn\u0027t allow such to happen. I had a great deal more to say, or so I thought.\n \"Master, it was you who said we were moving in a world where the old religions of superstition and violence were dying away. It was you who said we lived in a time when evil no longer aspired to any necessary place. Remember it, Master, you told Lestat that there was no creed or code that could justify our existence, for men knew now what was real evil, and real evil was hunger, and want, and ignorance and war, and cold. You said those things, Master, far more elegantly and fully than I could ever say them, but it was on this great rational basis that you argued, you, with the worst of us, for the sanctity and the precious glory of this natural and human world. It was you who championed the human soul, saying it had grown in depth and feeling, that men no longer lived for the glamour of war but knew the finer things which had once been the forte only of the richest, and could now be had by all. It was you who said that a new illumination, one of reason and ethics and genuine compassion, had come again, after dark centuries of bloody religion, to give forth not only its light but its warmth.\"\n \"Stop, Armand, don\u0027t say any more,\" he said. He was gentle but very stern. \"I remember those words. I remember all of them. But I don\u0027t believe those things anymore.\"\n I was stunned. I was stunned by the awesome simplicity of this disavowal. It was sweeping beyond my imagination, and yet I knew him well enough to know that he meant every word. He looked at me steadily.\n \"I believed it once, yes. But you see, it was not a belief based on reason and on observation of mankind as I told myself it was. It was never that, and I came to realize it and when I did, when I saw it for what it was-a blind desperate irrational prejudice-I felt it suddenly and completely collapse.\n \"Armand, I said those things because I had to hold them to be true. They were their own creed, the creed of the rational, the creed of the atheistic, the creed of the logical, the creed of the sophisticated Roman Senator who must turn a blind eye to the nauseating realities of the world around him, because if he were to admit what he saw in the wretchedness of his brothers and sisters, he would go mad.\"\n He drew in his breath and continued, turning his back to the bright room as if to shield the fledglings from the heat of his words, as surely as I wanted him to do it.\n \"I know history, I read it as others read their Bibles, and I will not be satisfied until I have unearthed all stories that are written and know-able, and cracked the codes of all cultures that have left me any tantalizing evidence that I might pry loose from earth or stone or papyrus or clay.\n \"But I was wrong in my optimism, I was ignorant, as ignorant as I accused others of being, and refusing to see the very horrors that surrounded me, all the worse in this century, this reasonable century, than ever before in the world.\n \"Look back, child, if you care to, if you would argue the point. Look back to golden Kiev, which you knew only in songs after the raging Mongols had burnt its Cathedrals and slaughtered its population like so much cattle, as they did all through the Kiev Rus for two hundred years. Look back to the chronicles of all Europe and see the wars waged everywhere, in the Holy Land, in the forests of France or Germany, up and down the fertile soil of England, yes, blessed England, and in every Asian corner of the globe.\n Oh, why did I deceive myself for so long? Did I not see those Russian grasslands, those burnt cities. Why, all of Europe might have fallen to Ghenghis Khan. Think of the great English Cathedrals torn down to rubble by the arrogant King Henry.\n Think of the books of the Mayas heaved into the flames by Spanish priests. Incas, Aztecs, Olmec-peoples of all nations ground to oblivion-.\n \"It\u0027s horrors, horrors upon horrors, and it always was, and I can pretend no longer. When I see millions gassed to death for the whims of an Austrian madman, when I see whole African tribes massacred till the rivers are stuffed with their bloated bodies, when I see rank starvation claim whole countries in an age of gluttonous plenty, I can believe all these platitudes no more.\n \"I don\u0027t know what single event it was that destroyed my self-deception. I don\u0027t know what horror it was that ripped the mask from my lies. Was it the millions who starved in the Ukraine, imprisoned in it by their own dictator, or the thousands after who died from the nuclear poisoning spewing into the skies over the grasslands, unprotected by the same governing powers who had starved them before? Was it the monasteries of noble Nepal, citadels of meditation and grace that had stood for thousands of years, older even than myself and all my philosophy, destroyed by an army of greedy grasping militarists who waged war without quarter upon monks in their saffron robes, and priceless books which they heaved into the fire, and ancient bells which they melted down no more to call the gentle to prayer? And this, this within two decades of this very hour, while the nations of the West danced in their discos and swilled their liquor, lamenting in casual tones for the poor sad fate of the distant Dalai Lama, and turning the television dial.\n \"I don\u0027t know what it was. Perhaps it was all the millions-Chinese, Japanese, Cambodian, Hebrew, Ukrainian, Polish, Russian, Kurdish, oh, God, the litany goes on without end. I have no faith, I have no optimism, I have no firm conviction in the ways of reason or ethics. I have no reproof for you as you stand on the Cathedral steps with your arms out to your all-knowing and all-perfect God.\n \"I know nothing, because I know too much, and understand not nearly enough and never will. But this you taught me as much as any other I\u0027ve ever known, that love is necessary, as much as rain to the flowers and the trees, and food to the hungry child, and blood to the starving thirsting predators and scavengers that we are. Love we need, and love can make us forget and forgive all savagery, as perhaps nothing else can.\n \"And so I took them out of their fabulous promising modern world with its diseased and desperate masses. I took them out and gave them the only might I possess, and I did it for you. I gave them time, time perhaps to find an answer which those mortals living now may never know.\n \"That was it, all of it. And I knew you would cry, and I knew you would suffer, but I knew you would have them and love them when it was finished, and I knew that you needed them desperately. So there you are ... joined now with the serpent and the lion and the wolf, and far superior to the worst of men who have proved themselves in this time to be colossal monsters, and free to feed with care upon a world of evil that can swallow every bit of pruning they care to do.\"\n A silence fell between us.\n I thought for a long while, rather than plunge into my words.\n Sybelle had stopped her playing, and I knew that she was concerned for me and needed me, I could feel it, feel the strong thrust of her vampire soul. I would have to go to her and soon.\n But I took my time to say a few more words:\n \"You should have trusted them, Master, you should have let them have their chance. Whatever you thought of the world, you should have let them have their time with it. It was their world and their time.\"\n He shook his head as though he was disappointed in me, and a little weary, and as he had resolved all these matters long ago in his mind, perhaps before I had even appeared last night, he seemed willing to let it all go.\n \"Armand, you are my child forever,\" he said with great dignity. \"All that is magical and divine in me is bounded by the human and always was.\"\n \"You should have let them have their hour. No love of me should have written their death warrant, or their admission to our strange and inexplicable world. We may be no worse than humans in your estimation, but you could have kept your counsel. You could have let them alone.\"\n It was enough.\n Besides, David had appeared. He had a copy already of the transcript we\u0027d labored on, but this was not his concern. He approached us slowly, announcing his presence obviously to give us the chance to become silent, which we did.\n I turned to him, unable to restrain myself. \"Did you know this was to happen? Did you know when it did?\"\n \"No, I did not,\" he said solemnly.\n \"Thank you,\" I said.\n \"They need you, your young ones,\" David said. \"Marius may be the Maker but they are utterly yours.\"\n \"I know,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going. I\u0027ll do what I\u0027m bound to do.\"\n Marius put his hand out and touched my shoulder. I realized suddenly that he was truly on the verge of losing his self-control.\n When he spoke his voice was tremulous and lustrous with feeling.\n He hated the storm inside himself and he was overcome by my sorrow. I knew this plainly enough. It gave me no satisfaction at all.\n \"You despise me now, and perhaps you\u0027re right. I knew you would weep, but in a very profound way, I misjudged you. I didn\u0027t realize something about you. Perhaps I never have.\"\n \"What\u0027s that, Master,\" I said with acidic drama.\n \"You loved them selflessly,\" he whispered. \"For all their strange faults, and wild evil, they were not compromised for you. You loved them perhaps more respectfully than I... than I ever loved you.\"\n He seemed so amazed.\n I could only nod. I wasn\u0027t so sure he was right. My need for them had never been tested, but I didn\u0027t want to tell him so.\n \"Armand,\" he said. \"You know you can stay here as long as you like.\"\n \"Good, because I just might,\" I said. \"They love it, and I\u0027m weary. So thank you very much for that.\"\n \"But one thing more,\" he went on, \"and I mean this with all my heart.\"\n \"What is it, Master?\" I said.\n David stood by, and I was happy for that, for it seemed to act as a certain curb upon my tears.\n \"I honestly don\u0027t know the answer to this, and I ask you in humility,\" Marius said. \"When you saw the Veil, what was it you really saw? Oh, I don\u0027t mean was it Christ, or was it God, or was it a miracle. What I mean is this. There was the face of a being, drenched in blood, who had given birth to a religion guilty of more wars and more cruelty than any creed the world has ever known. Don\u0027t be angry with me, please, just explain to me. What was it you saw? Was it only a magnificent reminder of the ikons you once painted? Or was it truly something drenched in love and not in blood? Tell me. If it was love and not blood, I would honestly like to know.\"\n \"You ask an old and simple question,\" I said, \"and from where I stand you don\u0027t really know a thing. You wonder how He could have been my Lord, given this world as you describe it, and knowing what you know of the Gospels and the Testaments printed in His name. You wonder how I could have believed all that because you don\u0027t believe it, isn\u0027t that so?\"\n He nodded. \"Yes, I do wonder. Because I know you. And I know that faith is something which you simply do not have.\"\n I was startled. But instantly I knew he was right.\n I smiled. I felt a sort of tragic thrilling happiness suddenly.\n \"Well, I see what you mean,\" I said. \"And I\u0027ll tell you my answer. I saw Christ. A kind of bloody light. A personality, a human, a presence that I felt I knew. And He wasn\u0027t the Lord God Father Almighty and He wasn\u0027t the maker of the universe and the whole world. And He wasn\u0027t the Savior or the Redeemer for sins inscribed on my soul before I was born. He wasn\u0027t the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, and He wasn\u0027t the Theologian expounding from the Holy Mount. He wasn\u0027t those things for me. Maybe for others, but not forme.\"\n \"But who was He, then, Armand?\" David asked. \"I have your story, full of marvels and suffering, yet I don\u0027t know. What was the concept of the Lord when you spoke the word?\"\n \"Lord,\" I repeated it. \"It doesn\u0027t mean what you think. It\u0027s spoken with too much intimacy and too much warmth. It\u0027s like a secret and sacred name. Lord.\" I paused, and then continued:\n \"He is the Lord, yes, but only because He is the symbol of something infinitely more accessible, something infinitely more meaningful than a ruler or king or lord can ever be.\"\n Again, I hesitated, wanting to find the right words since they were so sincere.\n \"He was . . . my brother\" I said. \"Yes. That is what He was, my brother, and the symbol of all brothers, and that is why He was the Lord, and that is why His core is simply love. You scorn it. You look askance at what I say. But you don\u0027t grasp the complexity of what He was. It\u0027s easy to feel, perhaps, but not so easy to really see. He was another man like me. And maybe for many of us, millions upon millions, that\u0027s all He\u0027s ever been! We\u0027re all somebody\u0027s sons and daughters and He was somebody\u0027s son. He was human, whether He was God or not, and He was suffering and He was doing it for things He thought were purely and universally good. And that meant that His blood might as well have been my blood too. Why, it had to be. And maybe that is the very source of His magnificance for thinkers such as me. You said I had no faith. I don\u0027t. Not in titles or in legends or in hierarchies made by other beings like ourselves. He didn\u0027t make a hierarchy, not really. He was the very thing. I saw in Him magnificence for simple reasons. There was flesh and blood to what He was! And it could be bread and wine to feed the whole Earth. You don\u0027t get it. You can\u0027t. Too many lies about Him swim in your ken. I saw Him before I heard so much about Him. I saw Him when I looked at the ikons in my house, and when I painted Him long before I even knew all His names. I can\u0027t get Him out of my head. I never have. I never will.\"\n I had no more to say.\n They were very amazed but not particularly respecting, pondering the words in all the wrong ways, perhaps, I couldn\u0027t absolutely know. It didn\u0027t matter what they felt anyway. It wasn\u0027t really so good that they had asked me or that I had tried so hard to tell them my truth. I saw the old ikon in my mind, the one my Mother had brought to me in the snow. Incarnation. Impossible to explain in their philosophy. I wondered. Perhaps the horror of my own life was that, no matter what I did or where I went, I always understood. Incarnation. A kind of bloody light.\n I wanted to be left alone by them now.\n Sybelle was waiting, which was of far greater importance, and I went to take her in my arms.\n For many hours we talked together, Sybelle and Benji and me, and finally Pandora, who was very distraught but would say nothing of it, came to talk casually and gaily with us too. Marius joined us and also David.\n We were gathered in a circle on the grass under the stars. For the young ones, I put on the bravest of faces and we spoke of beautiful things, and places we would wander, and wonders which Marius and Pandora had seen, and we argued now and then amiably about trivial things.\n About two hours before dawn, we had broken up, with Sybelle sitting by herself deep in the garden, looking at one flower after another with great care. Benji had discovered that he could read at preternatural speed and was tearing through the library, which was very impressive indeed.\n David, seated at Marius\u0027s desk, corrected his misspellings and abbreviations in the typescript, painstakingly correcting the copy he had made for me in haste.\n Marius and I sat very close together against the same oak tree, my shoulder against his. We didn\u0027t talk. We were watching things, and listening perhaps to the same songs of the night.\n I wanted Sybelle to play again. I had never known her to go so long without playing, and I wanted badly to hear her play the Sonata again.\n It was Marius who first heard an unusual sound, and stiffened with alarm, only to give it up and rest back beside me again.\n \"What was it?\" I asked.\n \"Only a little noise. I couldn\u0027t ... I couldn\u0027t read it,\" he said. He rested his shoulder against me as he had before.\n Almost immediately I saw David look up from his work. And then Pandora appeared, walking slowly but warily towards one of the lighted doors.\n Now I heard the sound. And so did Sybelle, for she too looked in the direction of the garden gate. Even Benji had finally deigned to notice it, and he dropped his book in mid-sentence and came marching with a very stern little scowl to the door to take stock of this new situation and get it firmly under control.\n At first I thought my eyes had deceived me, but very quickly I realized the identity of the figure who appeared as the gate opened and closed quietly behind his stiff and ungainly arm.\n He limped as he approached, or seemed rather the victim of a weariness and a loss of practice at the simple act of walking as he came into the light that fell on the grass before our feet.\n I was astonished. No one knew his intentions. No one moved.\n It was Lestat, and he was tattered and dusty as he had been on the chapel floor. No thoughts emanated from his mind as far as I could figure, and his eyes looked vague and full of exhausting wonder. He stood before us, merely staring, and then as I rose to my feet, scrambled in fact, to embrace him; he came near to me, and whispered in my ear.\n His voice was faltering and weak from lack of use, and he spoke very softly, his breath just touching my flesh.\n \"Sybelle,\" he said.\n \"Yes, Lestat, what is it, what about her, tell me,\" I said. I held his hands as firmly and lovingly as I could.\n \"Sybelle,\" he said again. \"Do you think she would play the Sonata for me if you asked her? The Appassionato?\"\n I drew back and looked into his vague drifting blue eyes.\n \"Oh, yes,\" I said, near breathless with excitement, with overflowing feeling. \"Lestat, I\u0027m sure she would. Sybelle!\"\n She had already turned. She watched him in amazement as he made his way slowly across the lawn and into the house. Pandora stepped back for him, and we all watched in respectful silence as he sat down near the piano, his back to the front right leg of it, and his knees brought up and his head resting wearily on his folded arms. He closed his eyes.\n \"Sybelle,\" I asked, \"would you play it for him? The Appassionata, again, if you would.\"\n And of course, she did.\n THE END \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6/page-25.html","bookId":2214,"book":{"id":2214,"title":"The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6) \n Armand until now has played a small role in the Vampire Chronicles.
