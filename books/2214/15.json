{"id":103066,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"15 A MELLOW and comforting voice spoke to me, directly to me: \"Your Master\u0027s vain works are all burnt; nothing but ashes remain now of his paintings. God forgive him, that he used his sublime powers not in the service of God but in the service of the World, the Flesh and the Devil, yes, I say the Devil, though the Devil is our standard bearer, for the Evil One is proud of us and satisfied with our pain; but Marius served the Devil with no regard to the wishes of God, and the mercies granted us by God, that rather than burn in the flames of Hell, we rule in the shadows of the Earth.\" \"Ah,\" I whispered. \"I see your twisted philosophy.\" There came no admonition. Gradually, though I had rather hear only the voice, my eyes began to focus. There were human skulls, bleached and covered with dust, pressed in the domed earth over my head. Skulls pressed into the earth with mortar so that they formed the entire ceiling, like clean white shells from the sea. Shells for the brain, I thought, for what is left of them, as they protrude from the mortared soil behind them, but the dome that covers the brain and the round black holes where once the jellied eyes were poised, acute as dancers, ever vigilant to report the splendors of the world to the carapaced mind. All skulls, a dome of skulls, and where the dome came down, to meet the walls, a lacing of thigh bones all around it, and below that the random bones of the mortal form, making no pattern, any more than random stones do when they are similarly pressed in mortar to make a wall. All bones, this place, and lighted with candles. Yes, I smelled the candles, purest beeswax, as for the rich. \"No,\" said the voice, thoughtfully, \"rather for the church, for this is God\u0027s church, though the Devil is our Superior General, the founding saint of our Order, so why not beeswax? Leave it to you, a vain and a worldly Venetian, to think it luxury, to confuse it with the wealth in which you wallowed rather like the pig in his slops.\" I laughed softly. \"Give me more of your generous and idiotic logic,\" I said. \"Be the Aquinas of the Devil. Speak on.\" \"Don\u0027t mock me,\" he said imploringly and sincerely. \"I saved you from the fire.\" \"I would be dead now if you had not.\" \"You want to burn?\" \"No, not to suffer so, no, I can\u0027t bear the thought of it, that I or anyone should suffer so. But to die, yes.\" \"And what do you think will be your destination if you do die? Are the fires of Hell not fifty times as hot as the fires we lighted for you and your friends? You are Hell\u0027s child; you were from the first moment that the blasphemer Marius infused you with our blood. No one can reverse this judgment. You are kept alive by blood that is cursed and unnatural and pleasing to Satan, and pleasing to God only because He must have Satan to show forth His goodness, and to give mankind a choice to be good or bad.\" I laughed again, but as respectfully as I could. \"There are so many of you,\" I said. I turned my head. The numerous candles blinded me, but it wasn\u0027t unpleasant. It was as if a different species of flame danced on the wicks, than the species that had consumed my brothers. \"Were they your brothers, these spoilt and pampered mortals?\" he asked. His voice was unwavering. \"Do you believe all the rot you\u0027re talking to me?\" I asked, imitating his tone. He laughed now, and it was a decently, churchly laugh as though we were whispering together about the absurdity of a sermon. But the Blessed Sacrament was not here as it would be in a consecrated church, so why whisper? \"Dear one,\" he said. \"It would be so simple to torture you, to turn your arrogant little mind inside out, and make you nothing but an instrument for raucous screams. It would be nothing to wall you up so that your screams would not be too loud for us, but merely a pleasing accompaniment to our nightly meditation. But I have no taste for such things. That is why I serve the Devil so well; I have never come to like cruelty or evil. I despise them, and would that I could look upon a Crucifix, I would do so and weep as I did when I was a mortal man.\" I let my eyes close, forsaking all the dancing flames that besprinkled the gloom. I sent my strongest most stealthy power into his mind, but came upon a locked door. \"Yes, that is my image for shutting you out. Painfully literal for such an educated infidel. But then your dedication to Christ the Lord was nourished among the literal and the naive, was it not? But here, someone comes with a gift for you which will greatly hasten our agreement.\" \"Agreement, Sir, and what agreement will that be?\" I asked. I too heard the other. A strong and terrible odor penetrated my nostrils. I did not move or open my eyes. I heard the other one laughing in that low rumbling fashion so perfected by the others who had sung the Dies Irae with such lewd polish. The smell was noxious, the smell was that of human flesh burnt or something thereof. I hated it. I began to turn my head and tried to stop myself. Sound and pain I could endure, but not this terrible, terrible odor. \"A gift for you, Amadeo,\" said the other. I looked up. I stared into the eyes of a vampire formed like a young man with whitish-blond hair and the long lean frame of a Norseman. He held up a great urn with both hands. And then he turned it. \"Ah, no, stop!\" I threw up my hands. I knew what it was. But it was too late. The ashes came down in a torrent on me. I choked and cried, and turned over. I couldn\u0027t get them out of my eyes and my mouth. \"The ashes of your brothers, Amadeo,\" said the Norse vampire. He gave way to a wild peal of laughter. Helpless, lying on my face, my hands up to the sides of my face, I shook myself all over, feeling the hot weight of the ashes. At last I turned over and over, and then sprang up to my knees, and to my feet. I backed into the wall. A great iron rack of candles went over, the little flames arcing in my blurred vision, the tapers themselves thudding in the mud. I heard the clatter of bones. I flung my arms up in front of my face. \"What\u0027s happened to our pretty composure?\" asked the Norse vampire. \"We are a weeping cherub, aren\u0027t we? That is what your Master called you, cherub, no? Here!\" He pulled at my arm, and with the other hand tried to smear the ashes on me. \"You damnable fiend!\" I cried. I went mad with fury and indignation. I grabbed his head with both my hands, and using all my strength turned it around on his neck, snapping all the bones, and then I kicked him hard with my right foot. He sank down on his knees, moaning, living still with his broken neck, but not in one piece would he live, I vowed, and kicking at him with the full weight of my right foot, I tore his head from him, the skin ripping and snapping, and the blood pouring out of the gaping trunk, I yanked the head free. \"Ah, look at you now, Sir!\" I said, staring down into his frantic eyes. The pupils still danced. \"Oh, die, will you, for your own sake.\" I buried my left fingers tight in his hair, and turning this way and that, I found a candle with my right hand, ripped it from the iron nail that held it and jammed it into his eye sockets one after the other, until he saw no more. \"Ah, then it can be done this way as well,\" I said looking up and blinking in the dazzle of the candles. Slowly, I made out his figure. His thick curly black hair was free and tangled, and he sat at an angle, black robes flowing down around his stool, facing slightly away from me, but regarding me so that I could trace the lineaments of his face easily in the light. A noble and beautiful face, with the curling lips as strong as the huge eyes. \"I never liked him,\" he said softly, raising his eyebrows, \"though I must say, you do impress me, and I did not expect to see him gone so soon.\" I shuddered. A horrible coldness seized me, a soulless ugly anger, routing sorrow, routing madness, routing hope. I hated the head I held and wanted to drop it, but the thing still lived. The bleeding sockets quivered, and the tongue darted from side to side out of the mouth. \"Oh, this is a revolting thing!\" I cried. \"He always said such unusual things,\" said the black-haired one. \"He was a pagan, you see. That you never were. I mean he believed in the gods of the north forest, and in Thor ever circling the world with his hammer...\" \"Are you going to talk forever?\" I asked. \"I must burn this thing even after this, mustn\u0027t I?\" I asked. He threw me the most charming innocent smile. \"You are a fool to be in this place,\" I whispered. My hands shook uncontrollably. Not waiting for a response, I turned and snatched up another candle, having so thoroughly snuffed the other, and set fire to the dead being\u0027s hair. The stench sickened me. I made a sound like a boy crying. I dropped the flaming head into the robed and headless body. I threw the candle down into the flames, so that the wax might feed it. Gathering up the other candles I had knocked down, I fed them to the fire and stepped back as a great heat rose from the dead one. The head appeared to roll about in the flames, more than was likely, so I grabbed up the iron candelabra I had knocked over, and using this like a rake, I plunged it into the burning mass to flatten and crush what lay beneath the fire. At the very last his outstretched hands curled, fingers digging into the palms. Ah, to have life in this state, I thought wearily, and with the rake I knocked the arms against the torso. The fire reeked of rags and human blood, blood he\u0027d drunk no doubt, but there was no other human scent to it, and with despair I saw that I had made a fire of him right in the middle of the ashes of my friends. Well, it seemed appropriate. \"You are revenged in one of them,\" I said with a defeated sigh. I threw down the crude candleholder rake. I left him there. The room was large. I walked dejectedly, my feet bare from the fire having burned off my felt slippers, to another broad place among iron candelabra, where the moist good earth was black and seemingly clean, and there I lay down again, as I had before, not caring that the black-haired one had a very good view of me there, as I was more in front of him than even before. \"Do you know that Northern worship?\" he asked, as if nothing dreadful had happened. \"Oh, that Thor is forever circling with his hammer, and the circle grows smaller and smaller, and beyond lies chaos, and we are here, doomed within the dwindling circle of warmth. Have you ever heard it? He was a pagan, made by renegade magicians who used him to murder their enemies. I am glad to be rid of him, but why do you cry?\" I didn\u0027t answer. This was beyond all hope, this horrid domed chamber of skulls, the myriad candles illuminating only remnants of death, and this being, this beautiful powerfully built black-haired being ruling amid all this horror and feeling nothing on the death of one who had served him. who was now a pile of smoldering stinking bones. I imagined I was home. I was safe within my Master\u0027s bedchamber. We sat together. He read from a Latin text. It did not matter what the words were. All around us were the accouterments of civilization, sweet and pretty things, and the fabrics of the room had all been worked by human hands. \"Vain things,\" said the black-haired one. \"Vain and foolish, but you\u0027ll come to see it. You are stronger than I reckoned. But then he was centuries old, your Maker, nobody even tells of a time when there wasn\u0027t Marius, the lone wolf, who abides no one in his territory, Marius, the destroyer of the young.\" \"I never knew him to destroy any but those who were evil,\" I said in a whisper. \"We are evil, aren\u0027t we? All of us are evil. So he destroyed us without compunction. He thought he was safe from us. He turned his back on us! He considered us not worthy of his attentions, and look, how he has lavished all his strength on a boy. But I must say you are a most beautiful boy.\" There was a noise, an evil rustling, not unfamiliar. I smelled rats. \"Oh, yes, my children, the rats,\" he said. \"They come to me. Do you want to see? Turn over and look up at me, if you will? Think no more on St. Francis, with his birds and squirrels and the wolf at his side. Think on Santino, with his rats.\" I did look. I drew in my breath. I sat up in the dirt and stared at him. A great gray rat sat on his shoulder, its tiny whiskered snout just kissing his ear, its tail curling behind his head. Another rat had come to sit sedately, as if spellbound, in his lap. There were others gathered at his feet. Seeming loath to move lest they startle, he carefully dipped his right hand into a bowl of dried bread crumbs. I caught the scent only now, mingled with that of the rats. He offered a handful of crumbs to the rat on his shoulder, who ate from it gratefully and with strange delicacy, and then he dropped some of the bread in his lap, where three rats came to feast at once. \"Do you think I love such things?\" he said. He looked intently at me, his eyes widening with the emphasis on his words. His black hair was a dense tangled veil on his shoulders, his forehead very smooth and shining white in the candlelight. \"Do you think I love to live here in the bowels of the world,\" he asked sadly, \"under the great city of Rome, where the earth seeps waste from the foul throng above, and have these, the vermin, as my familiars? Do you think I was never flesh and blood, or that, having undergone this change for the sake of Almighty God and His Divine Plan, I don\u0027t long for the life you lived with your greedy Master? Have I not eyes to see the brilliant colors which your Master spread over his canvases? Do I not like the sounds of ungodly music?\" He gave a soft agonizing sigh. \"What has God made or ever suffered to be made that is distasteful in itself?\" he continued. \"Sin is not repulsive in itself; how absurd to think so. No one comes to love pain. We can only hope to endure it.\" \"Why all this?\" I asked. I was sick unto vomiting, but I held it back. I breathed as deeply as I could to let all the smells of this horror chamber flood my lungs and cease to torment me. I sat back, crossing my legs so that I could study him. I wiped the ashes out of my eye. \"Why? Your themes are entirely familiar, but what is this realm of vampires in black monkly robes?\" \"We are the Defenders of Truth,\" he said sincerely. \"Oh, who is not the defender of truth, for the love of Heaven,\" I said bitterly. \"Look, the blood of your brother in Christ is stuck all over my hands! And you sit, the freakish blood-stuffed replicant of a human being staring on all this as if it were so much chitchat among the candles!\" \"Ah, but you have a fiery tongue for one with such a sweet face,\" he said in cool wonder. \"So pliant you seem with your soft brown eyes and dark autumnal red hair, but you are clever.\" \"Clever? You burnt my Master! You destroyed him. You burnt up his children! I am your prisoner here, am I not? What for? And you talk of the Lord Jesus Christ to me? You? You? Answer me, what is this morass of filth and fancy, molded out of clay and blessed candles!\" He laughed. His eyes crinkled at the edges, and his face was cheerful and sweet. His hair, for all its filth and tangles, kept its preternatural luster. How fine he would have been if freed from the dictates of this nightmare. \"Amadeo,\" he said. \"We are the Children of Darkness,\" he explained patiently. \"We vampires are made to be the scourge of man, as is pestilence. We are part of the trials and tribulations of this world; we drink blood, and we kill for the glory of God who would test his human creatures.\" \"Don\u0027t speak horrors.\" I put my hands over my ears. I cringed. \"Oh, but you know it\u0027s true,\" he insisted without raising his voice. \"You know it as you see me in my robes and you look about my chamber. I am restrained for The Living Lord as were the monks of old before they learned to paint their walls with erotic paintings.\" \"You talk madness, and I don\u0027t know why you do it.\" I would not remember the Monastery of the Caves! \"I do it because I have found my purpose here and the purpose of God, and there is nothing Higher. Would you be damned and alone, and selfish and without purpose? Would you turn your back on a design so magnificent that not one tiny child is forgotten! Did you think you could live forever without the splendor of that great scheme, struggling to deny the handiwork of God in every beautiful thing which you coveted and made your own?\" I fell silent. Don\u0027t think on the old Russian saints. Wisely, he did not press. On the contrary, very softly, without the devilish lilt, he began to sing the Latin hymn ... Dies irae, dies ilia Solvet saeclum infavilla Teste David cum Sibylla Quantus tremor estfuturus... That day of wrath, that day will turn the earth to ashes. As both David and Sybelle have foretold How great a tremor there will be . . . \"And on that Day, that Final Day, we shall have duties for Him, we His Dark Angels shall take the Evil souls down into the inferno as is His Divine Will.\" I looked up at him again. \"And then the final plea of this hymn, that He have mercy on us, was His Passion not for us?\" I sang it softly in Latin: Recordare, Jesu pie, Quod sum causa tuae viae... Remember, merciful Jesus, That I was the cause of your way ... I pressed on, scarcely having the spirit for it, to fully acknowledge the horror. \"What monk was there in the Monastery of my childhood who didn\u0027t hope one day to be with God? What do you say to me now, that we, the Children of Darkness, serve Him with no hope of ever being with Him?\" He looked broken suddenly. \"Pray there is some secret that we don\u0027t know,\" he whispered. He looked off as if he were in fact praying. \"How can He not love Satan when Satan has done so well? How can He not love us? I don\u0027t understand, but I am what I am, which is this, and you are the same.\" He looked at me, eyebrows rising gently again to underscore his wonder. \"And we must serve Him. Otherwise we are lost.\" He slipped from the stool and came down towards me, settling on the floor opposite me, cross-legged, and putting his long arm out to place his hand on my shoulder. \"Splendid being,\" I said, \"and to think God made you as he made the boys you destroyed tonight, the perfect bodies you rendered to the fire.\" He was in deep distress. \"Amadeo, take another name and come with us, be with us. We need you. And what will you do alone?\" \"Tell me why you killed my Master.\" He let go of me and let his hand fall in the lap made by his black robe stretched across his knees. \"It\u0027s forbidden to us to use our talents to dazzle mortals. It is forbidden us to trick them with our skills. It is forbidden us to seek the solace of their company. It is forbidden us to walk in the places of light.\" Nothing in this surprised me. \"We are monks as pure at heart as those of Cluny,\" he said. \"We make our Monasteries strict and holy, and we hunt and we kill to perfect the Garden of Our Lord as a Vale of Tears.\" He paused, and then making his voice all the more soft and wondering, he continued. \"We are as the bees that sting, and the rats that steal the grain; we are as the Black Death come to take young or old, beautiful or ugly, that men and women shall tremble at the power of God.\" He looked at me, imploring me for understanding. \"Cathedrals rise from dust,\" he said, \"to show man wonder. And in the stones men carve the Danse Macabre to show that life is brief. We carry scythes in the army of the robed skeleton who is carved on a thousand doorways, a thousand walls. We are the followers of Death, whose cruel visage is drawn in a million tiny prayer books which the rich and the poor alike hold in their hands.\" His eyes were huge and dreamy. He looked about us at the grim domed cell in which we sat. I could see the candles in the black pupils of his eyes. His eyes closed for a moment, and then opened, clearer, more bright. \"Your Master knew these things,\" he said regretfully. \"He knew. But he was of a pagan time, obdurate and angry, and refusing ever the grace of God. In you, he saw God\u0027s grace, because your soul is pure. You are young and tender and open like the moonflower to take the light of the night. You hate us now, but you will come to see.\" \"I don\u0027t know that I will ever see anything again,\" I said. \"I\u0027m cold and small and have no understanding now of feeling, of longing, even of hate. I don\u0027t hate you, when I should. I\u0027m empty. I want to die.\" \"But it\u0027s God will when you die, Amadeo,\" he said. \"Not your own.\" He stared hard at me, and I knew I couldn\u0027t hide from him any longer my recollection-the monks of Kiev, starving slowly in their earthen cells, saying they must take sustenance for it was God\u0027s will when they should die. I tried to hide these things, I drew these tiny pictures to myself and locked them up. I thought of nothing. One word came to my tongue: horror. And then the thought that before this time I had been a fool. Another came into the room. It was a female vampire. She entered through a wooden door, letting it close carefully behind her as a good nun might do, in order that no unnecessary noise be made. She came up to him and stood behind him. Her full gray hair was tangled and filthy, as was his, and it too had formed a shapely veil of beauteous weight and density behind her shoulders. Her clothes were antique rags. She wore the low hip belt of women of olden times adorning a shapely dress that revealed her small waist and gently flaring hips, the courtly costume one sees graven on the stone figures of rich sarcophagi. Her eyes, like his, were huge as if to summon every precious particle of light in gloom. Her mouth was strong and fall, and the fine bones of her cheeks and jaw shone well for the thin layer of silvery dust that covered her. Her neck and bosom were almost bare. \"Will he be one of us?\" she asked. Her voice was so lovely, so comforting, that I felt I\u0027d been touched by it. \"I have prayed for him. I have heard him weeping inside though he makes no sound.\" I looked away from her, bound to be disgusted by her, my enemy, who had slain those I loved. \"Yes,\" said Santino, the dark-haired one. \"He\u0027ll be one of us, and he can be a leader. He has such strength. He slew Alfredo there, you see? Oh, it was wonderful to behold how he did it, with such rage and with such a baby\u0027s scowl on his face.\" She looked beyond me, at the ruin of what that vampire had been, and I didn\u0027t know myself what was left. I didn\u0027t turn to look at it. A deep bitter sorrow softened her expression. How beautiful she must have been in life; how beautiful still if the dust were taken away from her. Her eyes shot to me suddenly, accusingly, and then became mild. \"Vain thoughts, my child,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t live for looking glasses, as your Master did. I need no velvet or silks to serve my Lord. Ah, Santino, such a newborn thing he is, look at him.\" She spoke of me. \"In centuries gone by I might have penned verses in honor of such beauty, that it should come to us to grace God\u0027s sooted fold, a lily in the dark he is, a fairy\u0027s child planted by moonlight in a milkmaid\u0027s cradle to thrall the world with his girlish gaze and manly whisper.\" Her flattery enraged me, but I could not bear in this Hell to lose the sheer beauty of her voice, its deep sweetness. I didn\u0027t care what she said. And as I looked at her white face in which many a vein had become a ridge in stone, I knew she was far too old for my impetuous violence. Yet kill, yes, yank head from body, yes, and stab with candles, yes. I thought of these things with clenched teeth, and him, how I would dispatch him for he was not so old, not nearly by half with his olive skin, but these compulsions died like weeds sprung from my mind stung by a northern wind, the deep frozen wind of my will dying inside of me. Ah, but they were beautiful. \"You will not renounce all beauty,\" she said kindly, having drunk up my thoughts perhaps, despite all my devices for concealing them. \"You will see another variant of beauty-a harsh and variegated beauty- when you take life and see that marvelous corporeal design become a blazing web as you do suck it dry, and dying thoughts do fall on you like wailing veils to dim your eyes and make you but the school of those poor souls you hasten to glory or perdition-yes, beauty. You will see beauty in the stars that can forever be your comfort. And in the earth, yes, the earth itself, you will find a thousand shades of darkness. This will be your beauty. You do but forswear the brash colors of mankind and the defiant light of the rich and the vain.\" \"I forswear nothing,\" I said. She smiled, her face filling with a warm and irresistible warmth, her huge long mat of white hair curling here and there in the ardent flicker of the candles. She looked to Santino. \"How well he understands the things we say,\" she said. \"And yet he seems the naughty boy who mocks all things in ignorance.\" \"He knows, he knows,\" the other answered with surprising bitterness. He fed his rats. He looked at her and me. He seemed to muse and even to hum the old Gregorian chant again. I heard others in the dark. And far away the drums still beat, but that was unendurable. I looked to the ceiling of this place, the blinded mouthless skulls that looked on all with limitless patience. I looked at them, the seated figure of Santino brooding or lost in thought, and behind him and above him, her statuesque form in its ragged raiment, her gray hair parted in the middle, her face ornamented by the dust. \"Those Who Must Be Kept, child, who were they?\" she asked suddenly. Santino raised his right hand and made a weary gesture. \"Allesandra, of that he does not know. Be sure of it. Marius was too clever to tell him. And what of it, this old legend we\u0027ve chased for countless years? Those Who Must Be Kept. If They are such that They must be kept, then They are no more, for Marius is no more to keep Them.\" A tremor ran through me, a terror that I would break into uncontrollable weeping, that I should let them see this, no, an abomination. Marius no more ... Santino hastened to go on, as if in fear for me. \"God willed it. God has willed that all edifices should crumble, all texts be stolen or burnt, all eyewitnesses to mystery be destroyed. Think on it, Allesandra. Think. Time has plowed under all those words written in the hand of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and Paul. Where is there one parchment scroll left which bears the signature of Aristotle? And Plato, would that we had one scrap he threw into the fire when feverishly working-?\" \"What are those things to us, Santino?\" she asked reprovingly, but her hand touched his head as she looked down. She smoothed his hair as though she were his Mother. \"I meant to say that it is the way of God,\" Santino said, \"the way of His creation. Even what is writ in stone is washed away by time, and cities lie beneath the fire and ash of roaring mountains. I meant to say the Earth eats all, and now it\u0027s taken him, this legend, this Marius, this one so much older than any we ever knew by name, and with him go his precious secrets. So be it.\" I locked my hands together to stop their trembling. I said nothing. \"There was a town in which I lived,\" he went on, murmuring. He held a fat black rat now in his arms, stroking its fur as if it were the prettiest of cats, and it with its tiny eye seemed unable to move, its tail a great curved scythe turned downward. \"A lovely town it was, with high thick walls, and such a Fair each year; words can\u0027t describe where all the merchants showed their wares and all the villages both far and near sent young and old to buy, to sell, to dance, to feast... it seemed a perfect place! And yet the plague took it. The plague came, respecting no gate or wall or tower, invisible to the Lord\u0027s men, and to the Father in the field and the Mother in her kitchen garden. The plague took all, all it seemed except the most wicked. In my house they walled me up, with bloating corpses of my brothers and sisters. It was a vampire found me out, for foraging there he found no other blood to drink but mine. And there had been so many!\" \"Do we not give up our mortal history for the love of God?\" Allesandra asked but most carefully. Her hand worked on his hair and brushed it back from his forehead. His eyes were huge with thought and memory, yet as he spoke again he looked at me, perhaps not even seeing me. \"There are no walls there now. It\u0027s gone to trees and blowing grass and piles of rubble. And in castles far away one finds the stones which once made up our lord\u0027s keep, our finest hard-paved street, our proudest houses. It is the very nature of this world that all things are devoured and time is a mouth as bloody as any other.\" A silence fell. I could not stop my shivering. My body quaked. A moan broke from my lips. I looked from right to left and bowed my head, my hands tight to my neck to stop from screaming. When I looked up again, I spoke. \"I won\u0027t serve you!\" I whispered. \"I see your game. I know your scriptures, your piety, your love of resignation! You\u0027re spiders with your dark and intricate webs, no more than that, and breed for blood is all you know, all you know round which to weave your tiresome snares, as wretched as the birds that make their nests in filth on marble casements. So spin your lies. I hate you. I will not serve you!\" How lovingly they both looked at me. \"Oh, poor child,\" Allesandra said with a sigh. \"You have only just begun to suffer. Why must it be for pride\u0027s sake and not for God?\" \"I curse you!\" Santino snapped his fingers. It was such a small gesture. But out of the shadows, through doorways like secretive dumb mouths in the mud walls, there came his servants, hooded, robed, as before. They gathered me up, securing my limbs, but I didn\u0027t struggle. They dragged me to a cell of iron bars and earthen walls. And when I sought to dig my way out of it, my clawing fingers came upon iron-bound stone, and I could dig no more. I lay down. I wept. I wept for my Master. I didn\u0027t care if anyone heard or mocked. I didn\u0027t care. I knew only loss and in that loss the very size of my love, and in knowing the size of love could somehow feel its splendor. I cried and cried. I turned and groveled in the earth. I clutched at it, and tore at it, and then lay still with only silent tears flowing. Allesandra stood with her hands on the bars. \"Poor child,\" she whispered. \"I will be with you, always with you. You have only to call my name.\" \"And why is that? Why?\" I called out, my voice echoing off the stony walls. \"Answer me.\" \"In the very depths of Hell,\" she said, \"do not demons love one another?\" An hour passed. The night was old. I thirsted. I burned with it. She knew it. I curled up on the floor, my head bowed, sitting back on my heels. I would die before I would drink blood again. But it was all that I could see, all that I could think of, all that I could want. Blood. After the first night, I thought I would die of this thirst. After the second, I thought I would perish screaming. After the third, I only dreamed of it in weeping and in desperation, licking at my own blood tears on my fingertips. After six nights of this when I could bear the thirst no longer, they brought a struggling victim to me. Down the long black passage I smelled the blood. I smelled it before I saw their torchlight. A great stinking muscular youth who was dragged towards my cell, who kicked at them and cursed them, growling and drooling like a madman, screaming at the very sight of the torch with which they bullied him, forcing him towards me. I climbed to my feet, too weak almost for this effort, and I fell on him, fell on his succulent hot flesh and tore open his throat, laughing and weeping as I did it, as my mouth was choked with blood. Roaring and stammering, he fell beneath me. The blood bubbled up out of the artery over lips and my thin fingers. How like bones they looked, my fingers. I drank and drank and drank until I could contain no more, and all the pain was gone from me, and all the despair was gone in the pure satisfaction of hunger, the pure greedy hateful selfish devouring of the blessed blood. To this gluttonous, mindless, mannerless feast they left me. Then falling aside, I felt my vision clear again in the dark. The walls around me sparkled once more with tiny bits of ore like a starry firmament. I looked and saw that the victim I had taken was Riccardo, my beloved Riccardo, my brilliant and goodhearted Riccardo-naked, wretchedly soiled, a fattened prisoner, kept all this while in some stinking earthen cell just for this. I screamed. I beat at the bars and bashed my head against them. My white-faced warders rushed to the bars and then backed away in fear and peered at me across the dark corridor. I fell down on my knees crying. I grabbed up the corpse. \"Riccardo, drink!\" I bit into my tongue and spit the blood on his greasy staring face. \"Riccardo!\" But he was dead and empty, and they had gone, leaving him there to rot in this place with me, to rot beside me. I began to sing \"Dies irae, dies ilia\" and to laugh as I sang it. Three nights later, screaming and cursing, I tore the reeking corpse of Riccardo limb from limb so I could hurl the pieces out of the cell. I could not endure it! I flung the bloated trunk at the bars again and again and fell down, sobbing, unable to drive my fist or foot into it to break its bulk. I crawled into the farthest corner to get away from it. Allesandra came. \"Child, what can I say to comfort you?\" A bodiless whisper in the darkness. But there was another figure there, Santino. Turning I saw by some errant light which only a vampire\u0027s eyes could gather that he put his finger to his lip and he shook his head, gently correcting her. \"He must be alone now,\" Santino said. \"Blood!\" I screamed. I flew at the bars, my arm stretched out so that both were affrighted and rushed away from me. At the end of seven more nights, when I was starved to the point where even the scent of the blood didn\u0027t rouse me, they laid the victim-a small boy child of the streets crying for pity-directly in my arms. \"Oh, don\u0027t be afraid, don\u0027t,\" I whispered, sinking my teeth quickly into his neck. \"Hmmmmm, trust in me,\" I whispered, savoring the blood, drinking it slowly, trying not to laugh with delight, my blood tears of relief falling down on his little face. \"Oh, dream, dream sweet and pretty things. There are saints who will come; do you see them?\" Afterwards I lay back, satiated, and picking from the muddy ceiling over my head those infinitesimal stars of hard bright stone or flinty iron that lay embedded in the earth. I let my head roll to the side, away from the corpse of the poor child which I had arranged carefully, as for the shroud, against the wall behind me. I saw a figure in my cell, a small figure. I saw its gauzy outline against the wall as it stood gazing at me. Another child? I rose up, aghast. No scent came from it. I turned and stared at the corpse. It lay as before. Yet there, against the far wall, was the very boy himself, small and wan and lost, looking at me. \"How is this?\" I whispered. But the wretched little thing couldn\u0027t speak. It could only stare. It was clothed in the very same white shift that its corpse wore, and its eyes were large and colorless and soft with musing. A distant sound came into my hearing. It was of a shuffling step in the long catacomb that led to my little prison. This was no vampire\u0027s step. I drew up, my nostrils flaring ever so slightly as I tried to catch the scent of this being. Nothing changed in the damp musty air. Only the scent of death was the aroma of my cell, of the poor broken little body. I fixed my eyes on the tenacious little spirit. \"Why do you linger here?\" I asked it desperately in a whisper. \"Why can I see you?\" It moved its little mouth as if it meant to speak, but it only shook its head ever so slightly, piteously eloquent of its confusion. The steps came on. And once again I struggled to catch the scent. But there was nothing, not even the dusty reek of a vampire\u0027s robes, only this, the approach of this shuffling sound. And finally there came to the bars the tall shadowy figure of a haggard woman. I knew that she was dead. I knew. I knew she was as dead as the little one who hovered by the wall. \"Speak to me, please, oh, please, I beg you, I pray you, speak to me! \"I cried out. But neither phantom could look away from the other. The child with a quick soft tread hurried into the woman\u0027s arms, and she, turning, with her babe restored, began to fade even as her feet once again made the dry scraping sound on the hard mud floor which had first announced her. \"Look at me!\" I begged in a low voice. \"Just one glance.\" She paused. There was almost nothing left of her. But she turned her head and the dim light of her eye fixed on me. Then soundlessly, totally, she vanished. I lay back, and flung out my arm in careless despair and felt the child\u0027s corpse, still faintly warm beside me. I did not always see their ghosts. I did not seek to master the means of doing so. They were no friends to me-it was a new curse-these spirits that would now and then collect about the scene of my bloody destruction. I saw no hope in their faces when they did pass through those moments of my wretchedness when the blood was warmest in me. No bright light of hope surrounded them. Was it starvation that had brought about this power? I told no one about them. In that damned cell, that cursed place where my soul was broken week after week without so much as the comfort of an enclosing coffin, I feared them and then grew to hate them. Only the great future would reveal to me that other vampires, in the main, never see them. Was it a mercy? I didn\u0027t know. But I get ahead of myself. Let me return to that intolerable time, that crucible. Some twenty weeks were passed in this misery. I didn\u0027t even believe anymore that the bright and fantastical world of Venice had ever existed. And I knew my Master was dead. I knew it. I knew that all I loved was dead. I was dead. Sometimes I dreamt I was home in Kiev in the Monastery of the Caves, a saint. Then I awoke to anguish. When Santino and the gray-haired Allesandra came to me, they were gentle as ever, and Santino shed tears to see me as I was, and said: \"Come to me, come now, come study with me in earnest, come. Not even those as wretched as we should suffer as you suffer. Come to me.\" I entrusted myself to his arms, I opened my lips to his, I bowed my head to press my face to his chest, and as I listened to his beating heart, I breathed deep, as if the very air had been denied me until that moment. Allesandra laid her cool, soft hands so gently on me. \"Poor orphan child,\" she said. \"Wandering child, oh, such a long road you\u0027ve traveled to come to us.\" And what a wonder it was that all they had done to me should seem but a thing we shared, a common and inevitable catastrophe. SANTINO\u0027S CELL. I lay on the floor in the arms of Allesandra, who rocked me and stroked my hair. \"I want you to hunt with us tonight,\" said Santino. \"You come with us, with Allesandra and with me. We won\u0027t let the others torment you. You are hungry. You are so very hungry, are you not?\" And so my tenure with the Children of Darkness began. Night after night I did hunt in silence with my new companions, my new loved ones, my new Master and my new Mistress, and then I was ready to begin my new apprenticeship in earnest, and Santino, my teacher, with Allesandra to help him now and then, made me his own pupil, a great honor in the coven, or so the others were quick to tell me when they had the chance. I learnt what Lestat has already written from what I revealed to him, the great laws. One, that we were formed in Covens throughout the world, and each Coven would have its leader, and I was destined to be such a one, like unto the Superior of a convent, and that all matters of authority would be in my hands. I and I alone should determine when a new vampire should be made to join us; I and I alone would see to it that the transformation was made in the proper way. Two, the Dark Gift, for that is what we called it,, must never be given to those who were not beautiful, for the enslaving of the beautiful with the Dark Blood was more pleasing to a Just God. Three, that never should an ancient vampire make the new fledgling, for our powers increase with time and the power of the old ones is too great for the young. Witness the tragedy of myself, made by the last of the known Children of the Millennia, the great and terrible Marius. I had the strength of a demon in the body of a child. Four, that no one among us can destroy another among us, save the coven leader, who must at any time be prepared to destroy the disobedient of his flock. That all vagabond vampires, belonging to no coven, must be destroyed by that leader on sight. Five, no vampire must ever reveal his identity or his magical strengths to a mortal and thereafter be let to live. No vampire must ever write any words that reveal these secrets. Indeed no vampire\u0027s name was ever to be known in the mortal world, and any evidence of our existence which ever escaped into that realm must at all costs be eradicated, along with those who allowed such a terrible violation of God\u0027s will. There were other things. There were rituals, there were incantations, there was a folklore of sorts. \"We do not enter churches, for God should strike us dead if we do,\" declared Santino. \"We do not look upon the crucifix, and its mere presence on a chain about the neck of a victim is sufficient to save that mortal\u0027s life. We turn our eyes and fingers from the medals of the Virgin. We cower before the images of the saints. \"But we strike with a holy fire those who go unprotected. We feast when and where we will and with cruelty, and upon the innocent and upon those most blessed with beauty and riches. But we make no boast to the world of what we do, nor boast to one another. \"The great castles and courtrooms of the world are shut to us, for we must never, never, meddle in the destiny which Christ Our Lord had ordained for those made in His Image, any more than do the vermin, or the blazing fire, or the Black Death. \"We are a curse of the shadows; we are a secret. We are eternal. \"And when our work is done for Him, we gather without the comfort of riches or luxuries, in those places blessed by us underground for our slumber, and there with only fire and candles for light, we come together to say the prayers and sing the songs and dance, yes, dance about the fire, thereby to strengthen our will, thereby to share with our sisters and brothers our strength.\" Six long months passed during which I studied these things, during which I ventured forth into the back alleys of Rome to hunt with the others, to gorge myself upon the abandoned of fate who fell so easily into my hands. No more did I search the mind for a crime that justified my predatory feasting. No more did I practice the fine art of drinking without pain to the victim, no more did I shield the wretched mortal from the horror of my face, my desperate hands, my fangs. One night, I awoke to find myself surrounded by my brothers. The gray-haired woman helped me from my coffin of lead and told me that I should come with them. Out under the stars we went together. The bonfire had been built high, as it had been on the night my mortal brothers had died. The air was cool and full of the scent of spring flowers. I could hear the nightingale singing. And far off the whisperings and murmurings of the great crowded city of Rome. I turned my eyes towards the city. I saw her seven hills covered over with soft flickering lights. I saw the clouds above, tinged with gold, as they bore down on these scattered and beautiful beacons, as if the darkness of the sky were full with child. I saw the circle had formed around the fire. Two and three deep were the Children of Darkness. Santino, in a costly new robe of black velvet, ah, such a violation of our strict rubrics, came forward to kiss me on either cheek. \"We are sending you far away, to the north of Europe,\" he said, \"to the city of Paris, where the Coven leader has gone, as we all go sooner or later, into the fire. His children wait for you. They have heard tales of you, of your gentleness and your piety and your beauty. You will be their leader and their saint.\" My brothers one by one came to kiss me. My sisters, who were few in number, planted their kisses on my cheeks as well. I said nothing. I stood quiet, listening still for the song of the birds in the nearby pines, my eyes drifting now and then to the lowering Heavens and wondering if the rain would come, the rain which I could smell, so clean and pure, the only cleansing water allowed to me now, the sweet Roman rain, gentle and warm. \"Do you take the solemn vow to lead the Coven in the Ways of Darkness as Satan would have it and his Lord and Creator, God, would have it?\" \"I do.\" \"Do you vow to obey all orders sent to you from the Roman Coven?\" \"I do ...\" Words and words and words. Wood was heaped on the fire. The drums had begun. The solemn tones. I began to cry. Then came the soft arms of Allesandra, the soft mass of her gray hair against my neck. \"I will go with you north, my child,\" she said. I was overwhelmed with gratitude. I threw my arms around her, I held her hard cold body close to me, and I shook with sobs. \"Yes, dear, dear little one,\" she said. \"I will stay with you. I am old and I will stay with you until it is time for me to go to God\u0027s Justice, as we all must.\" \"Then we dance in jubilation!\" cried Santino. \"Satan and Christ, brothers in the House of the Lord, we give you this perfected soul!\" He threw up his arms. Allesandra stepped back from me, her eyes bright with tears. I could think of nothing but only my gratitude that she would be with me, that I would not make this awful terrible journey alone. With me, Allesandra, with me. Oh, Fool for Satan and the God Who made him! She stood beside Santino, tall as he was, majestic as she too threw up her arms and swung her hair from side to side. \"Let the dancing begin!\" she cried. The drums became a thunder, the horns wailed, and the thump of the tambourines filled my ears. A long low cry rose from the huge thick circle of vampires, and all at once, locking hands, they began to dance. I was pulled back into the chain they made about the raging bonfire. I was jerked from left to right as the figures turned this way, then that, then broke free and leapt spinning into the air. I felt the wind on the back of my neck as I turned, as I leapt. I reached out with perfect accuracy to receive the hands on either side of me, then to sway to the right and to the left again. Above, the silent clouds thickened, curled and sailed across the darkling sky. The rain came, its soft roar lost in the cries of the mad dancing figures, in the crackle of fire and the torrent of drums. I heard it. I turned and leapt high into the air and received it, the silvery rain floating down to me like the blessing of the dark Heavens, the baptismal waters of the damned. The music surged. A barbarous rhythm broke loose everywhere, the orderly chain of dancers forgotten. In rain and in the unquenchable blaze of the giant fire, the vampires threw out their arms, howling, writhing, their limbs constricting so that they stomped with backs bent, heels pounded into the earth, and then sprang free, arms outstretched, mouths open, hips churning as they whirled and leapt, and caught in raucous open-throated volume the hymn came again, Dies irae, dies ilia. Oh, yes, oh, yes, day of woe, oh, day of fire! Afterwards, when the rain came down solemnly and steadily, when the bonfire was no more but a black wreckage, when they all had gone off to hunt, when only a few milled the dark ground of the Sabbat, chanting their prayers in anguished delirium, I lay still, the rain washing me, as I put my face against the ground. It seemed the monks were there from the old Monastery in Kiev. They laughed at me, but gently. They said, \"Andrei, what made you think you could escape? Didn\u0027t you know that God had called you?\" \"Get away from me, you are not here, and I am nowhere; I am lost in the dark wastes of a winter without end.\" I tried to picture Him, His Holy Face. But there was only Allesandra, come to help me to my feet. Allesandra, who promised to tell me of dark times, long before Santino was made, when she had been given the Dark Gift in the forests of France to which we now would be going together. \"Oh Lord, Lord hear my prayer,\" I whispered. If I could but see the Holy Face. But we were forbidden such things. We could never, never look upon His Image! Until the end of the world, we would work without that comfort. Hell is the absence of God. What can I say in defense of myself now? What can I say? Others have told the tale, how for centuries I was the stalwart leader of the Paris Coven, how I lived out those years in ignorance and shadow, obeying old laws until there was no more any Santino or Roman Coven to send them to me, how in rags and quiet despair, I clung to the Old Faith and the Old Ways as others went into the fire to destroy themselves, or simply wandered away. What can I say in defense of the convert and the saint that I became? For three hundred years I was the vagabond angel child of Satan, I was his baby-faced killer, his lieutenant, his fool. Allesandra was always with me. When others perished or deserted, there was Allesandra who kept the faith. But it was my sin, it was my journey, it was my terrible folly, and I alone must carry the burden of it for as long as I exist. THAT LAST MORNING in Rome, before I was to leave for the north, it was decided that my name must be changed. Amadeo, containing the very word for God, was most unseemly for a Child of Darkness, especially one meant to lead the Paris Coven. From various choices given me, Allesandra chose the name Armand. So I became Armand.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6/page-15.html","bookId":2214,"book":{"id":2214,"title":"The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6) Armand until now has played a small role in the Vampire Chronicles.
