They cared about other things, such as world peace, the poor suffering homeless in the waning winter cold of New York, the price of medicines for the sick, and how dreadful it was that Israel and Palestine were forever in battle with each other. But they did not care one whit about the horrors they\u0027d beheld with their own eyes. They did not care that I killed every night for blood, that I lived off it and nothing else, and that I was a creature wed by my very nature to human destruction.\\n\\n They did not care one whit about the dead brother (his name was Fox, by the way, and the last name of my beautiful child is best left unmentioned).\\n\\n In fact if this text ever sees the light of the real world, you\u0027re bound to change both her first name and that of Benjamin.\\n\\n However, that\u0027s not my concern now. I can\u0027t think of the fate of these pages, except that they are very much for her, as I mentioned to you before, and if I\u0027m allowed to title them I think it will be Symphony for Sybelle.\\n\\n Not, please understand, that I love Benji no less. It\u0027s only that I haven\u0027t the same overwhelming protective feeling for him. I know that Benji will live out a great and adventurous life, no matter what should befall me or Sybelle, or even the times. It\u0027s in his flexible and enduring Bedouin nature. He is a true child of the tents and the blowing sands, though in his case, the house was a dismal cinder block hovel on the outskirts of Jerusalem where he induced tourists to pose for overpriced pictures with him and a filthy snarling camel.\\n\\n He\u0027d been flat out kidnapped by Fox under the felonious terms of a long-term lease of bondage for which Fox paid Benji\u0027s father five thousand dollars. A fabricated emigration passport was thrown into the bargain. He\u0027d been the genius of the tribe, without doubt, had mixed feelings about going home and had learnt in the New York streets to steal, smoke and curse, in that order. Though he swore up and down he couldn\u0027t read, it turned out that he could, and began to do so obsessively just as soon as I started throwing books at him.\\n\\n In fact, he could read English, Hebrew and Arabic, having read all three in the newspapers of his homeland since before he could remember.\\n\\n He loved taking care of Sybelle. He saw to it that she ate, drank milk, bathed and changed her clothes when none of these routine tasks interested her. He prided himself on the fact that he could by his wits obtain for her whatever she needed, no matter what happened to her.\\n\\n He was the front man for her with the hotel, tipping the maids, making normal talk at the front desk, which included remarkably finespun lies about the whereabouts of the dead Fox, who had become in Benji\u0027s never ending saga a fabulous world traveler and amateur photographer; he handled the piano tuner, who was called as often as once a week because the piano stood by the window, exposed to sun and cold, and also because Sybelle did indeed pound it with the fury that would indeed have impressed the great Beethoven. He spoke on the phone to the bank, all of whose personnel thought he was his older brother, David, pronounced Dahveed, and then made the requisite calls at the teller\u0027s window for cash as little Benjamin.\\n\\n I was convinced within nights of talking with him that I could give him as fine an education as Marius had ever given me, and that he would end up having his choice of universities, professions or amateur pursuits of mind-engaging substance. I didn\u0027t overplay my hand. But before the week was out I was dreaming of boarding schools for him from which he might emerge a gold-buttoned blue blazer-wearing American East Coast social conquistador.\\n\\n I love him enough to tear limb from limb anyone who so much as lays a finger on him.\\n\\n But between me and Sybelle there lies a sympathy which sometimes eludes mortals and immortals for the space of their entire lives. I know Sybelle. I know her. I knew her when I first heard her play, and I know her now, and I wouldn\u0027t be here with you if she were not under the protection of Marius. I will during the space of Sybelle\u0027s life never be parted from her, and there is nothing she can ever ask of me that I shall not give.\\n\\n I will endure unspeakable anguish when Sybelle inevitably dies. But that has to be borne. I have no choice now in the matter. I am not the creature I was when I laid eyes on Veronica\u0027s Veil, when I stepped into the sun.\\n\\n I am someone else, and that someone else has fallen deeply and completely in love with Sybelle and Benjamin and I cannot go back on it.\\n\\n Of course I am keenly conscious that I thrive in this love; being happier than I have ever been in my entire immortal existence, I have gained great strength from having these two as my companions. The situation is too nearly perfect to be anything but utterly accidental.\\n\\n Sybelle is not insane. She is nowhere near it, and I fancy that I understand her perfectly. Sybelle is obsessed with one thing, and that is playing the piano. From the first time she laid her hands on the keys she has wanted nothing else. And her \"career,\" as so generously planned for her by her proud parents and by the burningly ambitious Fox, never meant much of anything to her.\\n\\n Had she been poor and struggling perhaps recognition would have been indispensable to her love affair with the piano, as it would have given her the requisite escape from life\u0027s dreary domestic traps and routines. But she was never poor. And she is truly, in the very root of her soul, indifferent as to whether people hear her play her music or not.\\n\\n She needs only to hear it herself, and to know that she is not disturbing other people.\\n\\n In the old hotel, mostly full of rooms rented by the day, with only a handful of tenants rich enough to be lodged there year by year, as was Sybelle\u0027s family, she can play forever without disturbing anyone.\\n\\n And after her parents\u0027 tragic death, after she lost the only two witnesses who had been intimate to her development,, she simply could not cooperate with Fox\u0027s plans for her career any further.\\n\\n Well, all this I understood, almost from the beginning. I understood it in her incessant repetition of the Sonata No. 23, and I think if you were to hear it, you would understand it too. I want you to hear it.\\n\\n Understand, it will not at all faze Sybelle if other people do gather to listen to her. It won\u0027t bother her one whit if she\u0027s recorded. If other people enjoy her playing and tell her so, she\u0027s delighted. But it\u0027s a simple thing with her. \"Ah, so you too love it,\" she thinks. \"Isn\u0027t it beautiful?\" This is what she said to me with her eyes and her smiles the very first time I ever approached her.\\n\\n And I suppose before I go any further-and I do have more to put down about my children-I should address this question: How did I approach her? How did I come to be in her apartment on that fateful morning, when Dora stood in the Cathedral crying to the crowds about the miraculous Veil, and I, the blood in my veins having combusted, was in fact rocketing skyward?\\n\\n I don\u0027t know. I have rather tiresome supernatural explanations that read like tomes by members of the Society for the Study of Psychic Phenomena, or the scripts for Mulder and Scully on the television show called The X-Files. Or like a secret file on the case in the archives of the order of psychic detectives called the Talamasca.\\n\\n Bluntly, I see it this way. I have most-powerful abilities to cast spells, to dislocate my vision, and to transmit my image over distances, and to affect matter both at close range and matter which is out of sight. I must somehow, in this morning journey towards the clouds, have used this power. It might have been drawn from me in a moment of harrowing pain when I was for all purposes deranged and completely unaware of what was happening to me. It might have been a last desperate hysterical refusal to accept the possibility of death, or of the horrible predicament, so close to death, in which I found myself.\\n\\n That is, having fallen on the roof, burnt and in unspeakable torment, I might have sought a desperate mental escape, projecting my image and my strength into Sybelle\u0027s apartment long enough to kill her brother. It certainly is possible for spirits to exert enough pressure on matter to change it. So perhaps that is exactly what I did-project myself in spirit form and lay hands upon the substance that was Fox, and kill him.\\n\\n But I don\u0027t really believe all this. I\u0027ll tell you why.\\n\\n First off, though Sybelle and Benjamin are no experts, for all their savvy and seeming detachment, on the subject of death and its subsequent forensic analysis, they both insisted that Fox\u0027s body was bloodless when they got rid of it. The puncture wounds were apparent on his neck. In sum, they believe to this very hour that I was there, in substantial form, and that I did indeed drink Fox\u0027s blood.\\n\\n Now that a projected image cannot do, at least not insofar as I know it. No, it cannot devour the blood of an entire circulatory system and then dissolve itself, returning to the cicatricula of the mind from which it came. No, that is not possible.\\n\\n Of course, Sybelle and Benji could be wrong. What do they know about blood and bodies? But the fact is, they let Fox lie there, quite dead for some two days, or so they said, while they waited for the return of the Dybbuk or Angel whom they were sure would help them. Now in that time, the blood of a human body sinks down to the very lowest part of the carcass, and such a change would have been visible to these children. They noted no such thing.\\n\\n Ah, it makes my brain ache! The fact is, I don\u0027t know how I got to their apartment, or why. I don\u0027t know how it happened. And I do know, as I have already said, that as regards the entire experience- everything I saw and felt in the great restored Cathedral at Kiev, an impossible place-was as real as what I knew in Sybelle\u0027s apartment.\\n\\n There is one other small point, and though it is small it is crucial. After I had slain Fox, Benji did see my burnt body falling from the sky. He did see me, just as I saw him, from the window.\\n\\n There is one very terrible possibility. It is this. I was going to die that morning. It was going to happen. My ascent was driven by immense will and an immense love of God of which I have no doubt as I dictate these words now.\\n\\n But perhaps at the crucial moment, my courage failed me. My body failed me. And seeking some refuge from the sun, some way to thwart my martyrdom, I struck upon the predicament of Sybelle and her brother, and feeling her great need of me, I commenced to fall towards the shelter of the roof on which the snow and ice quickly covered me. My visit to Sybelle could have been, according to this interpretation, only a passing illusion, a powerful projection of self, as I\u0027ve said, a wish fulfillment of the need of this random and vulnerable girl about to be fatally beaten by her brother.\\n\\n As for Fox, I killed him, without doubt. But he died from fear, from failure of the heart, perhaps, from the pressure of my illusory hands on his fragile throat, from the power of telekinesis or suggestion.\\n\\n But as I stated before, I don\u0027t believe this.\\n\\n I was there in the Cathedral in Kiev. I broke the egg with my thumbs. I saw the bird fly free.\\n\\n I know my Mother stood at my side, and I know that my Father knocked over the chalice. I know because I know there is no part of me that could have imagined such a thing. And I know too because the colors I saw then and the music I heard were not made up of anything I had ever experienced.\\n\\n Now, there is simply no other dream I have ever had about which I can say this. When I said the Mass in Vladimir\u0027s City, I was in a realm made up of ingredients which my imagination simply does not have at its disposal.\\n\\n I don\u0027t want to say any more about it. It\u0027s too hurtful and awful to try to analyze it. I didn\u0027t will it, not with my conscious heart, and I had no conscious power over it. It simply happened.\\n\\n I would, if I could, forget it entirely. I am so extraordinarily happy with Sybelle and Benji that surely I want to forget it all for the space of their lifetimes. I want only to be with them, as I have been since the night I described to you.\\n\\n As you realize, I took my time in coming here. Having returned to the ranks of the dangerous Undead, it was very easy for me to discern from the roaming minds of other vampires that Lestat was safe in his prison here, and indeed was dictating to you the entire story of what had happened to him with God Incarnate and with Memnoch the Devil.\\n\\n It was very easy for me to discern, without revealing my own presence, that an entire world of vampires mourned for me with greater anguish and tears than I could ever have predicted.\\n\\n So, being confident of Lestat\u0027s safety, being baffled yet relieved by the mysterious fact that his stolen eye had been returned to him, I was at leisure to stay with Sybelle and Benji and I did so.\\n\\n With Benji and Sybelle I rejoined the world in a way which I had not done since my fledgling, my one and only fledgling, Daniel Molloy, had left me. My love for Daniel had never been entirely honest, and always viciously possessive, and quite entangled with my own hatred of the world at large, and my confusion in the face of the baffling modern times which had begun to open up to me when I emerged in the late years of the Eighteenth Century from the catacombs beneath Paris.\\n\\n Daniel himself had no use for the world, and had come to me hungering for our Dark Blood, his brain swimming with macabre, grotesque tales which Louis de Pointe du Lac had told him. Heaping every luxury upon him, I only sickened him with mortal sweets so that finally he turned away from the riches I offered, becoming a vagabond. Mad, roaming the streets in rags, he shut out the world almost to the point of death, and I, weak, muddled, tormented by his beauty, and lusting for the living man and not the vampire he might become, only brought him over to us through the working of the Dark Trick because he would have died otherwise.\\n\\n I was no Marius to him afterwards. It was too exactly as I supposed: he loathed me in his heart for having initiated him into Living Death, for having made him in one night both an immortal and a regular killer.\\n\\n As a mortal man, he had no real idea of the price we pay for what we are, and he did not want to learn the truth; he fled from it, in reckless dreams and spiteful wandering.\\n\\n And so it was as I feared. Making him to be my mate, I made a minion who saw me all the more clearly as a monster.\\n\\n There was never any innocence for us, there was never any springtime. There was never any chance, no matter how beautiful the twilight gardens in which we wandered. Our souls were out of tune, our desires crossed and our resentments too common and too well watered for the final flowering.\\n\\n It\u0027s different now.\\n\\n For two months I remained in New York with Sybelle and Benji, living as I\u0027ve never lived before, not since those long-ago nights with Marius in Venice.\\n\\n Sybelle is rich, as I think I\u0027ve told you, but only in a tedious struggling sort of way, with an income that pays for her exorbitant apartment and daily room service meals, with a margin for fine clothes, tickets to the symphony and an occasional spending spree.\\n\\n I am fabulously rich. So the first thing I did, with pleasure, was lavish upon Sybelle and Benjamin all the riches I had once lavished upon Daniel Molloy to much greater effect.\\n\\n They loved it.\\n\\n Sybelle, when she was not playing the piano, had no objections whatsoever to wandering to the picture shows with Benji and me, or to the symphony and the opera. She loved the ballet, and loved to take Benjamin to the finest restaurants, where he became a regular marvel to the waiters with his crisp enthusiastic little voice and his lilting way of rattling off the names of dishes, French or Italian, and ordering vintage wines which they poured for him, unquestioningly, despite all the good-intentioned laws that prohibit the serving of such strong spirits to children.\\n\\n I loved all this too, of course, and was delighted to discover that Sybelle also took a sporadic and playful interest in dressing me, in choosing jackets, shirts and such from racks with a quick point of her finger, and in picking out for me from velvet trays all kinds of jeweled rings, cufflinks, neck chains and tiny crucifixes of rubies and gold, solid-gold clips for money and that sort of thing.\\n\\n It was I who had played this masterly game with Daniel Molloy. Sybelle plays it with me in her own dreamy way, as I take care of the tiresome cash register details.\\n\\n I in turn have the supreme pleasure of carrying Benji about like a doll and getting him to wear all the Western finery I purchase, at least now and then, for an hour or two.\\n\\n We make a striking trio, the three of us dining at Lutece or Sparks (of course I don\u0027t dine)-Benji in his immaculate little desert robe, or got up in a finely fitted little suit with narrow lapels, white button-down shirt and flash of tie; me in my highly acceptable antique velvet and chokers of old crumbling lace; and Sybelle in the lovely dresses that spill endlessly out of her closet, confections her Mother and Fox once bought for her, close cut around her large breasts and small waist and always flaring magically about her long legs, hem high enough to reveal the splendid curve of her calf and its tautness when she slips her dark-stockinged feet into dagger-heeled slippers. Benji\u0027s close-cropped cap of curls is always the Byzantine halo for his dark enigmatic little face, her flowing waves are free, and my hair is the Renaissance mop again of long unruly curls that used to be my secret vanity.\\n\\n My deepest pleasure with Benji is education. Right off, we started having powerful conversations about history and the world, and found ourselves stretched out on the carpet of the apartment, poring over maps, as we discussed the entire progress of East and West and the inevitable influences upon human history of climate, culture and geography. Benji gabbles away all during television broadcasts of the news, calling each anchorperson intimately by his or her first name, slamming his fist in anger at the actions of world leaders and wailing loudly over the deaths of great princesses and humanitarians. Benji can watch the news, talk steadily, eat popcorn, smoke a cigarette and sing intermittently with Sybelle\u0027s playing, always on key-all more or less simultaneously.\\n\\n If I fall to staring at the rain as if I\u0027ve seen a ghost, it\u0027s Benji who beats on my arm and cries, \"What shall we do, Armand? We have three splendid movies to see tonight. I\u0027m vexed, I tell you, vexed, because if we go to any of these, we\u0027ll miss Pavarotti at the Met and I\u0027ll go pasty-white with sickness.\"\\n\\n Many times the two of us dress Sybelle, who looks at us as if she doesn\u0027t know what we\u0027re doing. We always sit talking with her when she bathes, because if we don\u0027t she\u0027s likely to go to sleep in the bathtub, or simply stay in there for hours, sponging the water over her beautiful breasts.\\n\\n Sometimes the only words she says all night are things like, \"Benji, tie your shoes,\" or \"Armand, he\u0027s stolen the silverware. Make him put it back,\" or with sudden astonishment, \"It\u0027s warm, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n I have never told anyone my life story as I\u0027ve told it to you here and now, but in conversation with Benji I have caught myself telling him many things which Marius told me-about human nature, and the history of the law, about painting and even about music.\\n\\n It was in these conversations, more than in anything else, that I came to realize in the last two months that I was a changed being.\\n\\n Some stifling dark terror is gone from me. I do not see history as a panorama of disasters, as once I think I did; and often I find myself remembering Marius\u0027s generous and beautifully optimistic predictions- that the world is ever improving; that war, for all the strife we see around us, has nevertheless gone out of fashion with those in power, and will soon pass from the arenas of the Third World as it has passed from the arenas of the West; and we will truly feed the hungry and shelter the homeless and take care of those who need love.\\n\\n With Sybelle, education and discussion are not the substance of our love. With Sybelle it is intimacy. I don\u0027t care if she never says anything. I don\u0027t go inside her mind. She doesn\u0027t want anybody to do that.\\n\\n As completely as she accepts me and my nature, I accept her and her obsession with the Appassionata. Hour after hour, night after night, I listen to Sybelle play, and with each fresh start I hear the minute changes of intensity and expression which pour forth in her playing. Gradually, on account of this, I have become the only listener of whom Sybelle has ever been conscious.\\n\\n Gradually, I have become part of Sybelle\u0027s music. I am there with her and the phrases and movements of the Appassionata. I am there and I am one who has never asked anything of Sybelle except that she do what she wants to do, and what she can do so perfectly.\\n\\n That\u0027s all Sybelle ever has to do for me-is what she will.\\n\\n If or when she wants to rise in \"fortune and men\u0027s eyes,\" I\u0027ll clear the way for her. If or when she wants to be alone, she will not see or hear me. If or when she wants anything, I will get it for her.\\n\\n And if or when she loves a mortal man or mortal woman, I\u0027ll do what she wants me to do. I can live in the shadows. Doting on her, I can live forever in gloom because there is no gloom when I am near her.\\n\\n Sybelle often goes with me when I hunt. Sybelle likes to see me feed and kill. I don\u0027t think I have ever allowed a mortal to do that. She tries to help me dispose of the remains or confuse the evidence of the cause of death, but I\u0027m very strong and swift and capable at this, so she is mostly the witness.\\n\\n I try to avoid taking Benji on these escapades because he becomes wildly and childishly excited, and it does him no good. To Sybelle it simply does nothing.\\n\\n There are other things I could tell you-how we handled the details of her brother\u0027s disappearance, how I transferred immense sums of money into her name and set up the appropriate and unbreakable trust funds for Benji, how I bought for her a substantial interest in the hotel in which she lives, and have put into her apartment, which is very huge for a hotel apartment, several other fine pianos which she enjoys, and how I have set aside for myself a safe distance from the apartment a lair with a coffin which is unfindable, unbreachable and indestructible, and to which I go on occasion, though I am more accustomed to sleeping in the little chamber they first gave to me, in which velvet curtains have been fitted tightly over the one window to the airwell.\\n\\n But the hell with all that.\\n\\n You know what I want you to know.\\n\\n What remains for us but to bring it to the moment, to sunset on this night when I came here, entering the very den of the vampires with my brother and with my sister, one on either side to see Lestat at last. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6/page-23.html","bookId":2214,"book":{"id":2214,"title":"The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6) \\n Armand until now has played a small role in the Vampire Chronicles.
