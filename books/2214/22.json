The distant sound of his voice, quite inaudible to Sybelle, instantly drove back the pain from all the surfaces of my limbs.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I mean, you see,\" he was talking away, \"it\u0027s all underneath the dead body, and we don\u0027t wanna lift it, the dead body, and you being a cop, you know, you being Drug Enforcement, they said you would know how to take care of it...\"\\n\\n I started to laugh. He had really done himself proud. I looked again at Sybelle, who was staring at me with a quiet resolute expression, one of profound intelligence and reflection.\\n\\n \"Push this cover up over my face,\" I said, \"and move away, far away. He\u0027s bringing us a regular prince of rogues. Hurry.\"\\n\\n She snapped into action. I could smell the blood of this victim already, though he was still in the ascending elevator, talking to Benji in low guarded terms.\\n\\n \"And all this you just happen to have in this apartment, you and she, and there\u0027s nobody else in on this?\"\\n\\n Oh, he was a beauty. I heard the murderer in his voice.\\n\\n \"I told you everything,\" Benji said in the most natural of little voices. \"You just help with this, you know, I can\u0027t have the police coming in here!\" Whisper. \"This is a fine hotel. How did I know this guy was going to die here! We don\u0027t use this stuff, you take the stuff, just get the body out of here. Now let me tell you-.\"\\n\\n The elevator opened to our floor.\\n\\n \"-this body is pretty messed up, so don\u0027t go all slobbering on me when you see it.\"\\n\\n \"Slobbering on you,\" growled the victim under his breath. Their shoes made soft hastening sounds on the carpet.\\n\\n Benji fumbled with his keys, pretending to be mixed up.\\n\\n \"Sybelle,\" he called out in warning. \"Sybelle, open the door.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t do it,\" I said in a low voice.\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" came her velvety answer.\\n\\n The barrels of the big lock turned.\\n\\n \"And this guy just happens to come up here and die on you with all this stuff.\"\\n\\n \"Well, not exactly,\" said Benji, \"but you made a bargain with me, no, I expect you to stick to it.\"\\n\\n \"Look, you little guttersnipe, I didn\u0027t make any bargain with you.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, then maybe I call the regular police then. I know you. Everybody in the bar knows you, who you are, you\u0027re always around. What are you going to do, big shot? Kill me?\"\\n\\n The door closed behind them. The smell of the man\u0027s blood flooded the apartment. He was besotted with brandy and had the poison cocaine in his veins as well, but none of this would make a particle of difference to my cleansing thirst. I could scarce contain myself. I felt my limbs tighten and try to flex beneath the coverlet.\\n\\n \"Well, isn\u0027t she the perfect princess,\" he said, his eyes obviously having fallen on Sybelle. Sybelle made no answer.\\n\\n \"Never mind her, you look there, under the covers. Sybelle, you come here by me. Come on, Sybelle.\"\\n\\n \"Under there? You\u0027re telling me the body\u0027s under there, and the cocaine is under the body?\"\\n\\n \"How many times I have to tell you?\" asked Benji, no doubt with his characteristic shrug. \"Look, what part don\u0027t you understand, I\u0027d like to know. You don\u0027t want this cocaine? I give it away. I\u0027ll be very popular in your favorite bar. Come on, Sybelle, this man says he will help, then he won\u0027t help, talk, talk, talk, typical government sleaze.\"\\n\\n \"Who are you calling a sleaze, kid?\" demanded the man with mock gentleness, the fragrance of the brandy thickening. \"That\u0027s some big vocabulary you have for such a little body. How old are you, kid? How the Hell did you get into this country? You go around in that nightgown all the time?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, sure, just call me Lawrence of Arabia,\" said Benji. \"Sybelle, come over here.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want her to come. I wanted her as far away from this as possible. She didn\u0027t move, and I was very glad of it.\\n\\n \"I like my clothes,\" Benji chattered on. Puff of sweet cigarette smoke. \"I should dress like kids in this place, I suppose, in blue jeans? As if. My people dressed like this when Mohammed was in the desert.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing like progress,\" said the man with a deep throaty laugh.\\n\\n He approached the bed with quick crisp steps. The scent of blood was so rich I could feel the pores of my burnt skin opening for it.\\n\\n I used the tiniest part of my strength to form a telepathic picture of him through their eyes-a tall brown-eyed man, sallow white skin, gaunt cheeks, receding brown hair, in a handmade Italian suit of shining black silk with flashing diamond cufflinks on his rich linen. He was antsy, fingers working at his sides, almost unable to stand still, his brain a riot of dizzy humor, cynicism and crazed curiosity. His eyes were greedy and playful. The ruthlessness underscored all, and there seemed in him a strong streak of genuine drug-nourished insanity. He wore his murders as proudly as he wore his princely suit and the shiny brown boots on his feet.\\n\\n Sybelle came near the bed, the sharp sweet scent of her pure flesh mingling with the heavier richer scent of the man. But it was his blood I savored, his blood that brought the juices up into my parched mouth. I could barely keep from making a sigh beneath the covers. I felt my limbs about to dance right out of their painful paralysis.\\n\\n The villain was sizing up the place, glancing left and right through open doors, listening for other voices, debating whether he should search this fancy overstuffed and rambling hotel apartment before he did anything else. His fingers would not be still. In a flash of wordless thought, I caught the quick realization that he\u0027d snorted the cocaine Benji had brought, and he wanted more immediately.\\n\\n \"My, but you are a beautiful young lady,\" he said to Sybelle.\\n\\n \"Do you want me to lift the cover?\" she asked.\\n\\n I could smell the small handgun that was jammed in his high black leather boot, and the other gun, very fancy and modern, a distinctly different collection of metallic scents, in the holster under his arm. I could smell cash on him too, that unmistakable stale smell of filthy paper money.\\n\\n \"Come on, you chicken, buster?\" asked Benji. \"You want me to pull back the cover? Say when. You\u0027re gonna be real surprised, believe me!\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no body under there,\" he said with a sneer. \"Why don\u0027t we sit down and have a little talk? This isn\u0027t really your place, is it? I think you children need a little paternal guidance.\"\\n\\n \"The body\u0027s all burnt up,\" said Benji. \"Don\u0027t get sick now.\"\\n\\n \"Burnt up!\" said the man.\\n\\n It was Sybelle\u0027s long hand that suddenly whipped the coverlet back. The cool air skidded across my skin. I stared up at the man who drew back, a half-strangled growl caught in his throat.\\n\\n \"For the love of God!\"\\n\\n My body sprang up, drawn by the plump fountain of blood like a hideous puppet on a score of whipping strings. I flailed against him, then anchored my burnt fingernails hard into his neck and wrapped the other arm around him in an agonizing embrace, my tongue flashing at the blood that spilled from the claw marks as I drew in and, ignoring the blazing pain in my face, opened my mouth wide and sank my fangs.\\n\\n Now I had him.\\n\\n His height, his strength, his powerful shoulders, his huge hands clamping to my hurt flesh, none of this could help him. I had him. I drew up the first thick swallow of blood and thought I would swoon. But my body wasn\u0027t about to allow it. My body had locked to him as if I were a thing of voracious tentacles.\\n\\n At once, his crazed and luminous thoughts drew me down into a glitzy swirl of New York images, of careless cruelty and grotesque horror, of rampant drug-driven energy and sinister hilarity. I let the images flood me. I couldn\u0027t go for the quick death. I had to have every drop of blood inside him, and for that the heart must pump and pump; the heart must not give up.\\n\\n If I had ever tasted blood this strong, this sweet and salty, I had no memory of it; there was no way in which memory could record such deliciousness, the absolute rapture of thirst slaked, of hunger cured, of loneliness dissolved in this hot and intimate embrace, in which the sound of my own seething, straining breath would have horrified me if I had cared about it.\\n\\n Such a noise I made, such a dreadful feasting noise. My fingers massaged his thick muscles, my nostrils were pressed into his pampered soap-scented skin.\\n\\n \"Hmmm, love you, wouldn\u0027t hurt you for the world, you feel it, it\u0027s sweet, isn\u0027t it?\" I whispered to him over the shallows of gorgeous blood. \"Hmmm, yes, so sweet, better than the finest brandy, hmmm...\"\\n\\n In his shock and disbelief, he suddenly let go utterly, surrendering to the delirium that I stoked with each word. I ripped at his neck, widening the wound, rupturing the artery more fully. The blood gushed anew.\\n\\n An exquisite shiver ran down my back; it ran down the backs of my arms, and down my buttocks and legs. It was pain and pleasure commingled as the hot and lively blood forced itself into the microfibers of my shriveled flesh, as it plumped the muscles beneath the roasted skin, as it sank into the very marrow of my bones. More, I had to have more.\\n\\n \"Stay alive, you don\u0027t want to die, no, stay alive,\" I crooned, rubbing my fingers up through his hair, feeling that they were fingers now, not the pterodactyl digits they\u0027d been moments before. Oh, they were hot; it was the fire all over again, it was the fire blazing in my scorched limbs, this time death had to come, I couldn\u0027t bear this any longer, but a pinnacle had been reached, and now it was past and a great soothing ache rushed through me.\\n\\n My face was pumped and teeming, my mouth fall again and again, and my throat now swallowing without effort.\\n\\n \"Ah, yes, alive, you\u0027re so strong, so wonderfully strong ...\" I whispered. \"Hmmm, no, don\u0027t go ... not yet, it\u0027s not time.\"\\n\\n His knees buckled. He sank slowly to the carpet, and I with him, pulling him gently over with me against the side of the bed, and then letting him fall beside me, so that we lay like lovers entangled. There was more, much more, more than ever I could have drunk in my regular state, more than ever I could have wanted.\\n\\n Even on those rare occasions when I was a fledgling and greedy and new, and had taken two or three victims a night, I had never drunk so deeply from any one of them. I was now into the dark tasty dregs, pulling out the very vessels themselves in sweet clots that dissolved on my tongue.\\n\\n \"Oh, you are so precious, yes, yes.\"\\n\\n But his heart could take no more. It was slowing to a lethal irretrievable pace. I closed my teeth on the skin of his face and ripped it open over his forehead, lapping at the rich tangle of bleeding vessels that covered his skull. There was so much blood here, so much blood behind the tissues of the face. I sucked up the fibers, and then spit them out bloodless and white, watching them drop to the floor like so much slop.\\n\\n I wanted the heart and the brain. I had seen the ancients take it. I knew how. I\u0027d seen the Roman Pandora once reach right into the chest.\\n\\n I went for it. Astonished to see my hand fully formed though dark brown in color, I made my fingers rigid like a deadly spade and drove it into him, tearing linen and cracking breastbone, and then reaching his soft entrails until I had the heart and held it as I\u0027d seen Pandora hold it. I drank from it. Oh, it had plenty of blood. This was magnificent. I sucked it to pulp and then let it fall.\\n\\n I lay as still as he, at his side, my right hand on the back of his neck, my head bowed against his chest, my breath coming in heavy sighs. The blood danced in me. I felt my arms and legs jerking. Spasms ran through me, so that the sight of his white dead carcass blinkered in my gaze. The room flashed on and off.\\n\\n \"Oh, what a sweet brother,\" I whispered. \"Sweet, sweet brother.\" I rolled on my back. I could hear the roar of his blood in my very ears, feel it moving over my scalp, feel it tingling in my cheeks and in the palms of my hands. Oh, good, too good, too lusciously good.\\n\\n \"Bad guy, hmmm?\" It was Benji\u0027s voice, far away in the world of the living.\\n\\n Far away in another realm where pianos ought to be played, and little boys should dance, they stood, the two like painted cutout figures against the swimming light of the room, merely gazing at me, he the little desert rogue with his fancy black cigarette, puffing away and smacking his lips and raising his eyebrows, and she merely floating it seemed, resolute and thoughtful as before, unshocked, untouched perhaps.\\n\\n I sat up and pulled up my knees. I rose to my feet, with only a quick handhold on the side of the bed to steady myself. I stood naked looking at her.\\n\\n Her eyes were filled with a deep rich gray light, and she smiled as she looked at me.\\n\\n \"Oh, magnificent,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"Magnificent?\" I said. I lifted my hands and pushed my hair back off my face. \"Show me to the glass. Hurry. I\u0027m thirsting. I\u0027m thirsting again already.\"\\n\\n It had begun, this was no lie. In a stupor of shock I stared into the mirror. I had seen such ruined specimens as this before, but each of us is ruined in our own way, and I, for alchemical reasons I couldn\u0027t proclaim, was a dark brown creature, the very perfect color of chocolate, with remarkably white opal eyes set with reddish-brown pupils. The nipples of my chest were black as raisins. My cheeks were painfully gaunt, my ribs perfectly defined beneath my shiny skin, and the veins, the veins that were so full of sizzling action, stood like ropes along my arms and the calves of my legs. My hair, of course, had never seemed so lustrous, so full, so much a thing of youth and natural beneficence.\\n\\n I opened my mouth. I ached with thirst. All the awakened flesh sang with thirst or cursed me with it. It was as if a thousand crushed and muted cells were now chanting for blood.\\n\\n \"I have to have more. I have to. Stay away from me.\" I hurried past Benji, who all but danced at my side.\\n\\n \"What do you want, what can I do? I\u0027ll get another one.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027ll get him for myself.\" I fell on the victim and slipped loose his silk tie. I quickly undid the buttons of his shirt.\\n\\n Benji fell at once to unbuckling his belt. Sybelle, on her knees, tugged at his boots.\\n\\n \"The gun, beware of the gun,\" I said in alarm. \"Sybelle, back away from him.\"\\n\\n \"I see the gun,\" she said reprovingly. She laid it aside carefully, as if it were a freshly caught fish and might flop from her hands. She peeled off his socks. \"Armand, these clothes,\" she said, \"they\u0027re too big.\"\\n\\n \"Benji, you have shoes?\" I asked. \"My feet are small.\"\\n\\n I stood up and hastily put on the shirt, fastening the buttons with a speed that dazzled them.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t watch me, get the shoes,\" I said. I pulled on the trousers, zipped them up, and with Sybelle\u0027s quick fingers to help, buckled the flapping leather belt. I pulled it as tight as I could. This would do.\\n\\n She crouched before me, her dress a huge flowered circle of prettiness around her, as she rolled the pant legs over my brown bare feet.\\n\\n I had slipped my hands through his fancy linked shirt cuffs without ever disturbing them.\\n\\n Benji threw down the black dress shoes, fine Bally pumps, never even worn by him, divine little wretch. Sybelle held one sock for my foot. Benji gathered up the other.\\n\\n When I put on the coat it was done. The sweet tingling in my veins had stopped. It was pain again, it was beginning to roar, as if I were threaded with fire, and the witch with the needle pulled on the thread, hard, to make me quiver.\\n\\n \"A towel, my dears, something old, common. No, don\u0027t, not in this day and age, don\u0027t think of it.\"\\n\\n Full of loathing I gazed down at his livid flesh. He lay staring dully at the ceiling, the soft tiny hair in his nostrils very black against his drained and awful skin, his teeth yellow above his colorless lip. The hair on his chest was a matted swarm in the sweat of his death, and against the giant gaping slit lay the pulp that had been his heart, ah, this was the evil evidence which must be shut from the eyes of the world on general principles.\\n\\n I reached down and slipped the ruins of his heart back into the cavity of his chest. I spit upon the wound and rubbed it with my fingers.\\n\\n Benji gasped. \"Look at it heal, Sybelle,\" he cried.\\n\\n \"Just barely,\" I said. \"He\u0027s too cold, too empty.\" I looked about. There lay the man\u0027s wallet, papers, a bag in leather, lots of green bills in a fancy silver clip. I gathered all this up. I stuffed the folded money in one pocket, and all else in the other. What else did he have? Cigarette, a deadly switchblade knife, and the guns, ah, yes, the guns.\\n\\n Into my coat pockets I put these items.\\n\\n Swallowing my nausea, I reached down and scooped him up, horrid flaccid white man in his pitiable silk shorts and fancy gold wristwatch. My old strength was indeed coming back. He was heavy, but I could easily heave him over my shoulder.\\n\\n \"What will you do, where will you go?\" Sybelle cried. \"Armand, you can\u0027t leave us.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll come back!\" said Benji. \"Here, gimme that watch, don\u0027t throw away that man\u0027s watch.\"\\n\\n \"Sshhh, Benji,\" Sybelle whispered. \"You know damned good and well I\u0027ve bought you the finest watches. Don\u0027t touch him. Armand, what can we do now to help you?\" She drew close to me. \"Look!\" she said pointing to the dangling arm of the corpse which hung just below my right elbow. \"He has manicured nails. How amazing.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah, he always took very good care of himself,\" said Benji. \"You know the watch is worth five thousand dollars.\"\\n\\n \"Hush up about the watch,\" she said. \"We don\u0027t want his things.\" She looked at me again. \"Armand, even now you\u0027re still changing. Your face, it\u0027s getting fuller.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, and it hurts,\" I said. \"Wait for me. Prepare a dark room for me. I\u0027ll come back as soon as I\u0027ve fed. I have to feed now, feed and feed to heal the scars that are left. Open the door for me.\"\\n\\n \"Let me see if there\u0027s anyone out there,\" said Benji with a quick dutiful rush to the door.\\n\\n I went out into the hallway, easily carrying the poor corpse, its white arms hanging down, swinging and banging against me just a little.\\n\\n What a sight I was in these big clothes. I must have looked like a mad poetical schoolboy who had raided the thrift stores for the finest threads and was off now in fancy new shoes to search out the rock bands.\\n\\n \"There isn\u0027t anyone out here, my little friend,\" I said. \"It\u0027s three of the clock and the hotel\u0027s asleep. And if reason serves me right, that\u0027s the door of the fire stairs there, at the very end of the hall, correct? There isn\u0027t anyone in the fire stairs either.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, clever Armand, you delight me!\" he said. He narrowed his little black eyes. He jumped up and down soundlessly on the hallway carpet. \"Give me the watch!\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"She\u0027s right. She\u0027s rich, and so am I, and so are you. Don\u0027t be a beggar.\"\\n\\n \"Armand, we\u0027ll wait for you,\" said Sybelle in the doorframe. \"Benji, come inside immediately.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, listen to her now, how she wakes up! How she talks! \u0027Benji, come inside,\u0027 she says. Hey, sweetheart, don\u0027t you have something to do just now, like perhaps play the piano?\"\\n\\n She gave a tiny burst of laughter in spite of herself. I smiled. What a strange pair they were. They did not believe their own eyes. But that was typical enough in this century. I wondered when they would start to see, and having seen, start screaming.\\n\\n \"Goodbye, sweet loves,\" I said. \"Be ready for me.\"\\n\\n \"Armand, you will come back.\" Her eyes were fall of tears. \"You promise me.\"\\n\\n I was stunned. \"Sybelle,\" I said. \"What is it that women want so often to hear and wait so long to hear it? I love you.\"\\n\\n I left them, racing down the stairs, hefting him to the other shoulder when the weight on the one side became too hurtful. The pain passed over me in waves. The shock of the outside cold air was scalding.\\n\\n \"Feed,\" I whispered. And what was I to do with him? He was far too naked to carry down Fifth Avenue.\\n\\n I slipped off his watch because it was the only identification on him left, and almost vomiting with revulsion from my closeness to these fetid remains, I dragged him by one hand after me very fast through the back alley, and then across a small street, and down another sidewalk.\\n\\n I ran into the face of the icy wind, not stopping to observe those few hulking shapes that hobbled by in the wet darkness, or to take stock of the one car that crept along on the shining wet asphalt.\\n\\n Within seconds I had covered two blocks, and finding a likely alleyway, with a high gate to keep out the beggars of the night, I quickly mounted the bars and flung his carcass to the very far end of it. Down into the melting snow he fell. I was rid of him.\\n\\n Now I had to have blood. There was no time for the old game, the game of drawing out those who wanted to die, those who truly craved my embrace, those in love already with the far country of death of which they knew nothing.\\n\\n I had to shuffle and stumble along, the mark, in my floppy silk jacket and rolled pants, long hair veiling my face, poor dazzled kid, perfect for your knife, your gun, your fist.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t take long.\\n\\n The first was a drunken, sauntering wretch who plied me with questions before he revealed the flashing blade and went to sink it into me. I pushed him up against the side of the building, and fed like a glutton.\\n\\n The next was a common desperate youth, fall of festering sores, who had killed twice before for the heroin he needed as badly as I needed the doomed blood inside him.\\n\\n I drank more slowly.\\n\\n The thickest worst scars of my body yielded with much defense, itching, throbbing and only slowly melting away. But the thirst, the thirst would not stop. My bowels churned as if devouring themselves. My eyes pulsed with pain.\\n\\n But the cold wet city, so full of rankling hollow noise, grew ever brighter before me. I could hear voices many blocks away, and small electronic speakers in high buildings. I could see beyond the breaking clouds the true and numberless stars.\\n\\n I was almost myself again.\\n\\n So who will come to me now, I thought, in this barren desolate hour before dawn, when the snow is melting in the warmer air, and neon lights have all died out, and the wet newspaper blows like leaves through a stripped and frozen forest?\\n\\n I took all the precious articles which had belonged to my first victim, and dropped them here and there into deep hollow public trash cans.\\n\\n One last killer, yes, please, fate, do give me this, while there\u0027s time, and indeed he came, blasted fool, out of a car as behind him the driver waited, the motor idling.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s taking you so damn long?\" said the driver at last.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" I said, dropping his friend. I leaned in to look at him. He was as vicious and stupid as his companion. He threw up his hand, but helplessly and too late. I pushed him over on the leather seat and drank now for rank pleasure, pure sweet crazed pleasure.\\n\\n I walked slowly through the night, my arms out, my eyes directed Heavenward.\\n\\n From the scattered black grates of the gleaming street there gushed the pure white steam of heated places below. Trash in shiny plastic sacks made a fantastical modern and glittering display on the curbs of the slate-gray sidewalks.\\n\\n Tiny tender trees, with little year-round leaves like short pen strokes of bright green in the night, bent their stemlike trunks with the whining wind. Everywhere the high clean glass doors of granite-faced buildings contained the radiant splendor of rich lobbies. Shop windows displayed their sparkling diamonds, lustrous furs and smartly cut coats and gowns on grandly coiffed and faceless pewter mannequins.\\n\\n The Cathedral was a lightless, soundless place of frost-rimmed turrets and ancient pointed arches, the pavement clean where I had stood on the morning when the sun caught me.\\n\\n Lingering there, I closed my eyes, trying perhaps to recall the wonder and the zeal, the courage and the glorious expectation.\\n\\n There came instead, clear and shining through the dark air, the pristine notes of the Appassionata. Roiling, rumbling, racing on, the crashing music came to call me home. I followed it.\\n\\n The clock in the hotel foyer was striking six. The winter dark would break up in moments like the very ice that had once imprisoned me. The long polished desk was deserted in the muted lights.\\n\\n In a wall mirror of dim glass framed in rococo gold, I saw myself, paled and waxen, and unblemished. Oh, what fun the sun and ice had had with me in turns, the fury of the one quick-frozen by the merciless grip of the other. Not a scar remained of where the skin had burnt to muscle. A sealed and solid thing with seamless agony within, I was, all of a piece, restored, with sparkling clear white fingernails, and curling lashes round my clear brown eyes, and clothes a wretched heap of stained, misfitted finery on the old familiar rugged cherub.\\n\\n Never before had I been thankful to see my own too youthful face, too hairless chin, too soft and delicate hands. But I could have thanked the gods of old for wings at this moment.\\n\\n Above, the music carried on, so grand, so legible of tragedy and lust and dauntless spirit. I loved it so. Who in the whole wide world could ever play that same Sonata as she did, each phrase as fresh as songs sung all their livelong life by birds who know but one such set of patterns.\\n\\n I looked about. It was a fine, expensive place, of old wainscoting and a few deep chairs, and door keys ranged up a wall in tiny dark-stained wooden boxes.\\n\\n A great vase of flowers, the infallible trademark of the vintage New York hotel, stood boldly and magnificently in the middle of the space, atop a round black marble table. I skirted the bouquet, snapping off one big pink lily with a deep red throat and petals curling to yellow at the outside, and then I went silently up the fire stairs to find my children.\\n\\n She did not stop her playing when Benji let me in.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re looking really good, Angel,\" he said.\\n\\n On and on she went, her head moving unaffectedly and perfectly with the rhythm of the Sonata.\\n\\n He led me through a chain of finely decorated plastered chambers. Mine was too sumptuous by far, I whispered, seeing the tapestry spread and pillows of old gracious threadbare gold. I needed only perfect darkness.\\n\\n \"But this is the least we have,\" he said with a little shrug.\\n\\n He had changed to a fresh white linen robe lined with a fine blue stripe, a kind I\u0027d often seen in Arab lands. He wore white socks with his brown sandals. He puffed his little Turkish cigarette, and squinted up at me through the smoke.\\n\\n \"You brought me back the watch, didn\u0027t you!\" He nodded his head, all sarcasm and amusement.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. I reached into my pocket. \"But you may have the money. Tell me, since your little mind is such a locket and I have no key, did anyone see you bring that badge-carrying, gun-toting villain up here?\"\\n\\n \"I see him all the time,\" he said with a little weary wave of his hand.\\n\\n \"We left the bar separately. I killed two birds with one stone. I\u0027m very smart.\"\\n\\n \"How so?\" I asked. I put the lily in his little hand.\\n\\n \"Sybelle\u0027s brother bought from him. That cop was the only guy ever missed him.\" He gave a little laugh. He tucked the lily in the thick curls above his left ear, then pulled it down and twirled its tiny ciborium in his fingers. \"Clever, no? Now nobody asks where he is.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, indeed, two birds with one stone, you\u0027re quite right,\" I said. \"Though I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a great deal more to it.\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027ll help us now, won\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I will indeed. I\u0027m very rich, I told you. I\u0027ll patch things up. I have an instinct for it. I owned a great playhouse in a faraway city, and after that an island of fancy shops, and other such things. I am a monster in many realms, it seems. You\u0027ll never, ever have to fear again.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re truly beauty fall, you know,\" he said raising one eyebrow and then giving me a quick wink. He drew on his tasty-looking little cigarette and then offered it to me. His left hand kept the lily safe.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t. Only drink blood,\" I said. \"A regular vampire out of the book in the main. Need deep darkness in the light of day, which is coming very soon. You mustn\u0027t touch this door.\"\\n\\n \"Ha!\" he laughed with impish delight. \"That\u0027s what I told her!\" He rolled his eyes and glanced in the direction of the living room. \"I said we had to steal a coffin for you right away, but she said, no, you\u0027d think of that.\"\\n\\n \"How right she was. The room will do, but I like coffins well enough. I really do.\"\\n\\n \"And can you make us vampires too?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, never. Absolutely not. You\u0027re pure of heart and too alive, and I don\u0027t have such a power. It\u0027s never done. It can\u0027t be.\"\\n\\n Again, he shrugged. \"Then who made you?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I was born out of a black egg,\" I said. \"We all are.\"\\n\\n He gave a scoffing laugh.\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027ve seen all the rest,\" I said. \"Why not believe the best part of it?\"\\n\\n He only smiled and puffed his smoke, and looked at me most knavishly.\\n\\n The piano sang on in crashing cascades, the rapid notes melting as fast as they were born, so like the last thin snowflakes of the winter, vanishing before they strike the pavements.\\n\\n \"May I kiss her before I go to sleep?\" I asked.\\n\\n He cocked his head, and shrugged. \"If she doesn\u0027t like it, she\u0027ll never stop playing long enough to say so.\"\\n\\n I went back into the parlor. How clear it all was, the grand design of sumptuous French landscapes with their golden clouds and cobalt skies, the Chinese vases on their stands, the massed velvet tumbling from the high bronze rods of the narrow old windows. I saw it all of a piece, including the bed where I had lain, now heaped with fresh down-filled coverlets and pillowed with embroidered antique faces.\\n\\n And she, the center diamond of it all, in long white flannel, flounced at wrists and hem with rich old Irish lace, playing her long lacquered grand with agile unerring fingers, her hair a broad smooth yellow glow about her shoulders.\\n\\n I kissed her scented locks, and then her tender throat, and caught her girlish smile and gleaming glance as she played on, her head tilting back to brush my coat front.\\n\\n Down around her neck, I slipped my arms. She leant her gentle weight against me. With crossed arms, I clasped her waist. I felt her shoulders moving against my snug embrace with her darting fingers.\\n\\n I dared in whisper-soft tones with sealed lips to hum the song, and she hummed with me.\\n\\n \"Appassionato,,\" I whispered in her ear. I was crying. I didn\u0027t want to touch her with blood. She was too clean, too pretty. I turned my head.\\n\\n She pitched forward. Her hands pounded into the stormy finish.\\n\\n A silence fell, abrupt, and crystalline as the music before it.\\n\\n She turned and threw her arms around me, and held me tight and said the words I\u0027d never heard a mortal speak in all my long immortal life:\\n\\n \"Armand, I love you.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6/page-22.html","bookId":2214,"book":{"id":2214,"title":"The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6) \\n Armand until now has played a small role in the Vampire Chronicles. Here he assumes center stage, relating his five hundred years of life to fledgling vampire David Talbot, who plays amanuensis to Armand as he did to Lestat ... It\u0027s not just the epic plot but Rice\u0027s voluptuary worldview that\u0027s the main attraction ... Elegant narrative has always been her hallmark ... Rice is equally effective in showing how Armand eventually loses his religion and becomes \"the vagabond angel child of Satan,\" living under Paris cemeteries and foundling the Grand Guignol-ish Theatre des Vampires. In the twentieth century, a rehabilitated Armand regains faith but falls in love with two children who save his life. By the conclusion of Armand, the pupil has become the mentor.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:39 PM"}}
