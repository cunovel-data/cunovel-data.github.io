{"id":31354,"no":106,"title":"CHAPTER IV. SILVER.","content":"We come next to speak of silver ore, another egregious folly of mankind. Silver is never found but in shafts sunk deep in the ground, there being no indications on the surface to raise hopes of its existence, no shining sparkles, as in the case of gold. The earth in which it is found is sometimes red, sometimes of an ashy hue. It is impossible, too, to melt it, except in combination with lead or galena, the latter being the name given to the vein of lead that is mostly found running near the veins of the silver ore. When submitted to the action of fire, part of the ore precipitates itself in the form of lead, while the silver is left floating on the surface, like oil[201] on water. Silver is found in nearly all our provinces, but the finest of all is that of Spain; where it is found, like gold, in uncultivated soils, and in the mountains. Wherever one vein of silver has been met with, another is sure to be found not far off: a fact that has been remarked in the case of nearly all the metals, which have thus derived their Greek name of “metalla.”[202] It is a remarkable fact, that the shafts opened by Hannibal in the Spanish provinces are still worked, their names being derived from the persons who were the first to discover them. One of these mines, still called B?belo at the present day, furnished Hannibal with three hundred pounds’ 261 weight of silver per day. The mountain is excavated for a distance of fifteen hundred paces; and throughout the whole of this distance water-bearers stand night and day, baling out the water in turns, by the dim light of torches. The vein of silver that is found nearest the surface is known by the name of “crudaria,” raw silver. In ancient times, the excavations used to be abandoned the moment alum was met with, and no further search was made. Of late, however, the discovery of a vein of copper beneath alum, has withdrawn any such limits to man’s hopes. The exhalations from silver-mines are dangerous to all animals, particularly to dogs. The softer they are, the more beautiful gold and silver are considered. There are two kinds of silver. On placing a piece upon an iron-shovel at a white heat, if the metal remains perfectly white, it is of the best quality: if it turns a reddish color, it is inferior; but if it becomes black, it is worthless. Fraud, however, has devised means of stultifying this test even; for by keeping the shovel immersed in ammonia, the piece of silver absorbs it as it burns, and so displays a fictitious whiteness.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2772/76723.html","bookId":1330,"book":{"id":1330,"title":"The Boys\u0027 and Girls\u0027 Pliny","description":"简介： In the little village of Como, in that province of Northern Italy called by the Romans Gaul-this-side-the-Alps, was born, twenty-three years after the coming of our Lord, Caius Plinius Secundus, known to us by the shorter name of Pliny.
