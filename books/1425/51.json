{"id":14593,"no":51,"title":"Chapter 12.","content":"When Lady Monteagle discovered, which she did a very few hours after the mortifying event, where Lord Cadurcis had dined the day on which he had promised to be her guest, she was very indignant, but her vanity was more offended than her self-complacency. She was annoyed that Cadurcis should have compromised his exalted reputation by so publicly dangling in the train of the new beauty: still more that he should have signified in so marked a manner the impression which the fair stranger had made upon him, by instantly accepting an invitation to a house so totally unconnected with his circle, and where, had it not been to meet this Miss Herbert, it would of course never have entered his head to be a visitor. But, on the whole, Lady Monteagle was rather irritated than jealous; and far from suspecting that there was the slightest chance of her losing her influence, such as it might be, over Lord Cadurcis, all that she felt was, that less lustre must redound to her from its possession and exercise, if it were obvious to the world that his attentions could be so easily attracted and commanded. When Lord Cadurcis, therefore, having dispatched his poem to Venetia, paid his usual visit on the next day to Monteagle House, he was received rather with sneers than reproaches, as Lady Monteagle, with no superficial knowledge of society or his lordship’s character, was clearly of opinion that this new fancy of her admirer was to be treated rather with ridicule than indignation; and, in short, as she had discovered that Cadurcis was far from being insensible to mockery, that it was clearly a fit occasion, to use a phrase then very much in vogue, for quizzing. ‘How d’ye do?’ said her ladyship, with an arch smile, ‘I really could not expect to see you!’ Cadurcis looked a little confused; he detested scenes, and now he dreaded one. ‘You seem quite distrait,’ continued Lady Monteagle, after a moment’s pause, which his lordship ought to have broken. ‘But no wonder, if the world be right.’ ‘The world cannot be wrong,’ said Cadurcis sarcastically. ‘Had you a pleasant party yesterday?’ ‘Very.’ ‘Lady —— must have been quite charmed to have you at last,’ said Lady Monteagle. ‘I suppose she exhibited you to all her friends, as if you were one of the savages that went to Court the other day.’ ‘She was courteous.’ ‘Oh! I can fancy her flutter! For my part, if there be one character in the world more odious than another, I think it is a fussy woman. Lady — — with Lord Cadurcis dining with her, and the new beauty for a niece, must have been in a most delectable state of bustle.’ ‘I thought she was rather quiet,’ said her companion with provoking indifference. ‘She seemed to me an agreeable person.’ ‘I suppose you mean Miss Herbert?’ said Lady Monteagle. ‘Oh! these are moderate expressions to use in reference to a person like Miss Herbert.’ ‘You know what they said of you two at Ranelagh?’ said her ladyship. ‘No,’ said Lord Cadurcis, somewhat changing colour, and speaking through his teeth; ‘something devilish pleasant, I dare say.’ ‘They call you Sedition and Treason,’ said Lady Monteagle. ‘Then we are well suited,’ said Lord Cadurcis. ‘She certainly is a beautiful creature,’ said her ladyship. ‘I think so,’ said Lord Cadurcis. ‘Rather too tall, I think.’ ‘Do you?’ ‘Beautiful complexion certainly; wants delicacy, I think.’ ‘Do you?’ ‘Fine eyes! Grey, I believe. Cannot say I admire grey eyes. Certain sign of bad temper, I believe, grey eyes?’ ‘Are they?’ ‘I did not observe her hand. I dare say a little coarse. Fair people who are tall generally fail in the hand and arm. What sort of a hand and arm has she?’ ‘I did not observe anything coarse about Miss Herbert.’ ‘Ah! you admire her. And you have cause. No one can deny she is a fine girl, and every one must regret, that with her decidedly provincial air and want of style altogether, which might naturally be expected, considering the rustic way I understand she has been brought up (an old house in the country, with a methodistical mother), that she should have fallen into such hands as her aunt. Lady —— is enough to spoil any girl’s fortune in London.’ ‘I thought that the —— were people of high consideration,’ said Lord Cadurcis. ‘Consideration!’ exclaimed Lady Monteagle. ‘If you mean that they are people of rank, and good blood, and good property, they are certainly people of consideration; but they are Goths, Vandals, Huns, Calmucks, Canadian savages! They have no fashion, no style, no ton, no influence in the world. It is impossible that a greater misfortune could have befallen your beauty than having such an aunt. Why, no man who has the slightest regard for his reputation would be seen in her company. She is a regular quiz, and you cannot imagine how everybody was laughing at you the other night.’ ‘I am very much obliged to them,’ said Lord Cadurcis. ‘And, upon my honour,’ continued Lady Monteagle, ‘speaking merely as your friend, and not being the least jealous (Cadurcis do not suppose that), not a twinge has crossed my mind on that score; but still I must tell you that it was most ridiculous for a man like you, to whom everybody looks up, and from whom the slightest attention is an honour, to go and fasten yourself the whole night upon a rustic simpleton, something between a wax doll and a dairymaid, whom every fool in London was staring at; the very reason why you should not have appeared to have been even aware of her existence.’ ‘We have all our moments of weakness, Gertrude,’ said Lord Cadurcis, charmed that the lady was so thoroughly unaware and unsuspicious of his long and intimate connection with the Herberts. ‘I suppose it was my cursed vanity. I saw, as you say, every fool staring at her, and so I determined to show that in an instant I could engross her attention.’ ‘Of course, I know it was only that; but you should not have gone and dined there, Cadurcis,’ added the lady, very seriously, ‘That compromised you; but, by cutting them in future in the most marked manner, you may get over it.’ ‘You really think I may?’ inquired Lord Cadurcis, with some anxiety. ‘Oh! I have no doubt of it,’ said Lady Monteagle. ‘What it is to have a friend like you, Gertrude,’ said Cadurcis, ‘a friend who is neither a Goth, nor a Vandal, nor a Hun, nor a Calmuck, nor a Canadian savage; but a woman of fashion, style, ton, influence in the world! It is impossible that a greater piece of good fortune could have befallen me than having you for a friend.’ ‘Ah, méchant! you may mock,’ said the lady, triumphantly, for she was quite satisfied with the turn the conversation had taken; ‘but I am glad for your sake that you take such a sensible view of the case.’ Notwithstanding, however, this sensible view of the case, after lounging an hour at Monteagle House, Lord Cadurcis’ carriage stopped at the door of Venetia’s Gothic aunt. He was not so fortunate as to meet his heroine; but, nevertheless, he did not esteem his time entirely thrown away, and consoled himself for the disappointment by confirming the favourable impression he had already made in this establishment, and cultivating an intimacy which he was assured must contribute many opportunities of finding himself in the society of Venetia. From this day, indeed, he was a frequent guest at her uncle’s, and generally contrived also to meet her several times in the week at some great assembly; but here, both from the occasional presence of Lady Monteagle, although party spirit deterred her from attending many circles where Cadurcis was now an habitual visitant, and from the crowd of admirers who surrounded the Herberts, he rarely found an opportunity for any private conversation with Venetia. His friend the Bishop also, notwithstanding the prejudices of Lady Annabel, received him always with cordiality, and he met the Herberts more than once at his mansion. At the opera and in the park also he hovered about them, in spite of the sarcasms or reproaches of Lady Monteagle; for the reader is not to suppose that that lady continued to take the same self-complacent view of Lord Cadurcis’ acquaintance with the Herberts which she originally adopted, and at first flattered herself was the just one. His admiration of Miss Herbert had become the topic of general conversation; it could no longer be concealed or disguised. But Lady Monteagle was convinced that Cadurcis was not a marrying man, and persuaded herself that this was a fancy which must evaporate. Moreover, Monteagle House still continued his spot of most constant resort; for his opportunities of being with Venetia were, with all his exertions, limited, and he had no other resource which pleased him so much as the conversation and circle of the bright goddess of his party. After some fiery scenes therefore with the divinity, which only led to his prolonged absence, for the profound and fervent genius of Cadurcis revolted from the base sentiment and mock emotions of society, the lady reconciled herself to her lot, still believing herself the most envied woman in London, and often ashamed of being jealous of a country girl. The general result of the fortnight which elapsed since Cadurcis renewed his acquaintance with his Cherbury friends was, that he had become convinced of his inability of propitiating Lady Annabel, was devotedly attached to Venetia, though he had seldom an opportunity of intimating feelings, which the cordial manner in which she ever conducted herself to him gave him no reason to conclude desperate; at the same time that he had contrived that a day should seldom elapse, which did not under some circumstances, however unfavourable, bring them together, while her intimate friends and the circles in which she passed most of her life always witnessed his presence with favour.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392/42310.html","bookId":1425,"book":{"id":1425,"title":"Venetia","description":"简介： Some ten years before the revolt of our American colonies, there was situate in one of our midland counties, on the borders of an extensive forest, an ancient hall that belonged to the Herberts, but which, though ever well preserved, had not until th...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM"}}
