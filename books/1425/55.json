{"id":14597,"no":55,"title":"Chapter 16.","content":"Venetia stopped for a moment to collect herself before she joined her aunt, but it was impossible to conceal her agitation from the Countess. They had not, however, been long together before they observed their friends in the distance, who had now quitted the palace. Venetia made the utmost efforts to compose herself, and not unsuccessful ones. She was sufficiently calm on their arrival, to listen, if not to converse. The Countess, with all the tact of a woman, covered her niece’s confusion by her animated description of their agreeable ride, and their still more pleasant promenade; and in a few minutes the whole party were walking back to their carriages. When they had arrived at the inn, they found Lord Cadurcis, to whose temporary absence the Countess had alluded with some casual observation which she flattered herself was very satisfactory. Cadurcis appeared rather sullen, and the Countess, with feminine quickness, suddenly discovered that both herself and her niece were extremely fatigued, and that they had better return in the carriages. There was one vacant place, and some of the gentlemen must ride outside. Lord Cadurcis, however, said that he should return as he came, and the grooms might lead back the ladies’ horses; and so in a few minutes the carriages had driven off. Our solitary equestrian, however, was no sooner mounted than he put his horse to its speed, and never drew in his rein until he reached Hyde Park Corner. The rapid motion accorded with his tumultuous mood. He was soon at home, gave his horse to a servant, for he had left his groom behind, rushed into his library, tore up a letter of Lady Monteagle’s with a demoniac glance, and rang his bell with such force that it broke. His valet, not unused to such ebullitions, immediately appeared. ‘Has anything happened, Spalding?’ said his lordship. ‘Nothing particular, my lord. Her ladyship sent every day, and called herself twice, but I told her your lordship was in Yorkshire.’ ‘That was right; I saw a letter from her. When did it come?’ ‘It has been here several days, my lord.’ ‘Mind, I am at home to nobody; I am not in town.’ The valet bowed and disappeared. Cadurcis threw himself into an easy chair, stretched his legs, sighed, and then swore; then suddenly starting up, he seized a mass of letters that were lying on the table, and hurled them to the other end of the apartment, dashed several books to the ground, kicked down several chairs that were in his way, and began pacing the room with his usual troubled step; and so he continued until the shades of twilight entered his apartment. Then he pulled down the other bell-rope, and Mr. Spalding again appeared. ‘Order posthorses for tomorrow,’ said his lordship. ‘Where to, my lord?’ ‘I don’t know; order the horses.’ Mr. Spalding again bowed and disappeared. In a few minutes he heard a great stamping and confusion in his master’s apartment, and presently the door opened and his master’s voice was heard calling him repeatedly in a very irritable tone. ‘Why are there no bells in this cursed room?’ inquired Lord Cadurcis. ‘The ropes are broken, my lord.’ ‘Why are they broken?’ ‘I can’t say, my lord,’ ‘I cannot leave this house for a day but I find everything in confusion. Bring me some Burgundy.’ ‘Yes, my lord. There is a young lad, my lord, called a few minutes back, and asked for your lordship. He says he has something very particular to say to your lordship. I told him your lordship was out of town. He said your lordship would wish very much to see him, and that he had come from the Abbey.’ ‘The Abbey!’ said Cadurcis, in a tone of curiosity. ‘Why did you not show him in?’ ‘Your lordship said you were not at home to anybody.’ ‘Idiot! Is this anybody? Of course I would have seen him. What the devil do I keep you for, sir? You seem to me to have lost your head.’ Mr. Spalding retired. ‘The Abbey! that is droll,’ said Cadurcis. ‘I owe some duties to the poor Abbey. I should not like to quit England, and leave anybody in trouble at the Abbey. I wish I had seen the lad. Some son of a tenant who has written to me, and I have never opened his letters. I am sorry.’ In a few minutes Mr. Spalding again entered the room. ‘The young lad has called again, my lord. He says he thinks your lordship has come to town, and he wishes to see your lordship very much.’ ‘Bring lights and show him up. Show him up first.’ Accordingly, a country lad was ushered into the room, although it was so dusky that Cadurcis could only observe his figure standing at the door. ‘Well, my good fellow,’ said Cadurcis; ‘what do you want? Are you in any trouble?’ The boy hesitated. ‘Speak out, my good fellow; do not be alarmed. If I can serve you, or any one at the Abbey, I will do it.’ Here Mr. Spalding entered with the lights. The lad held a cotton handkerchief to his face; he appeared to be weeping; all that was seen of his head were his locks of red hair. He seemed a country lad, dressed in a long green coat with silver buttons, and he twirled in his disengaged hand a peasant’s white hat. ‘That will do, Spalding,’ said Lord Cadurcis. ‘Leave the room. Now, my good fellow, my time is precious; but speak out, and do not be afraid.’ ‘Cadurcis!’ said the lad in a sweet and trembling voice. ‘Gertrude, by G— d!’ exclaimed Lord Cadurcis, starting. ‘What infernal masquerade is this?’ ‘Is it a greater disguise than I have to bear every hour of my life?’ exclaimed Lady Monteagle, advancing. ‘Have I not to bear a smiling face with a breaking heart?’ ‘By Jove! a scene,’ exclaimed Cadurcis in a piteous tone. ‘A scene!’ exclaimed Lady Monteagle, bursting into a flood of indignant tears. ‘Is this the way the expression of my feelings is ever to be stigmatised? Barbarous man!’ Cadurcis stood with his back to the fireplace, with his lips compressed, and his hands under his coat-tails. He was resolved that nothing should induce him to utter a word. He looked the picture of dogged indifference. ‘I know where you have been,’ continued Lady Monteagle. ‘You have been to Richmond; you have been with Miss Herbert. Yes! I know all. I am a victim, but I will not be a dupe. Yorkshire indeed! Paltry coward!’ Cadurcis hummed an air. ‘And this is Lord Cadurcis!’ continued the lady. ‘The sublime, ethereal Lord Cadurcis, condescending to the last refuge of the meanest, most commonplace mind, a vulgar, wretched lie! What could have been expected from such a mind? You may delude the world, but I know you. Yes, sir! I know you. And I will let everybody know you. I will tear away the veil of charlatanism with which you have enveloped yourself. The world shall at length discover the nature of the idol they have worshipped. All your meanness, all your falsehood, all your selfishness, all your baseness, shall be revealed. I may be spurned, but at any rate I will be revenged!’ Lord Cadurcis yawned. ‘Insulting, pitiful wretch!’ continued the lady. ‘And you think that I wish to hear you speak! You think the sound of that deceitful voice has any charm for me! You are mistaken, sir! I have listened to you too long. It was not to remonstrate with you that I resolved to see you. The tones of your voice can only excite my disgust. I am here to speak myself; to express to you the contempt, the detestation, the aversion, the scorn, the hatred, which I entertain for you!’ Lord Cadurcis whistled. The lady paused; she had effected the professed purport of her visit; she ought now to have retired, and Cadurcis would most willingly have opened the door for her, and bowed her out of his apartment. But her conduct did not exactly accord with her speech. She intimated no intention of moving. Her courteous friend retained his position, and adhered to his policy of silence. There was a dead pause, and then Lady Monteagle, throwing herself into a chair, went into hysterics. Lord Cadurcis, following her example, also seated himself, took up a book, and began to read. The hysterics became fainter and fainter; they experienced all those gradations of convulsive noise with which Lord Cadurcis was so well acquainted; at length they subsided into sobs and sighs. Finally, there was again silence, now only disturbed by the sound of a page turned by Lord Cadurcis. Suddenly the lady sprang from her seat, and firmly grasping the arm of Cadurcis, threw herself on her knees at his side. ‘Cadurcis!’ she exclaimed, in a tender tone, ‘do you love me?’ ‘My dear Gertrude,’ said Lord Cadurcis, coolly, but rather regretting he had quitted his original and less assailable posture, ‘you know I like quiet women.’ ‘Cadurcis, forgive me!’ murmured the lady. ‘Pity me! Think only how miserable I am!’ ‘Your misery is of your own making,’ said Lord Cadurcis. ‘What occasion is there for any of these extraordinary proceedings? I have told you a thousand times that I cannot endure scenes. Female society is a relaxation to me; you convert it into torture. I like to sail upon a summer sea; and you always will insist upon a white squall.’ ‘But you have deserted me!’ ‘I never desert any one,’ replied Cadurcis calmly, raising her from her supplicating attitude, and leading her to a seat. ‘The last time we met, you banished me your presence, and told me never to speak to you again. Well, I obeyed your orders, as I always do.’ ‘But I did not mean what I said,’ said Lady Monteagle. ‘How should I know that?’ said Lord Cadurcis. ‘Your heart ought to have assured you,’ said the lady. ‘The tongue is a less deceptive organ than the heart,’ replied her companion. ‘Cadurcis,’ said the lady, looking at her strange disguise, ‘what do you advise me to do?’ ‘To go home; and if you like I will order my vis-à-vis for you directly,’ and he rose from his seat to give the order. ‘Ah!’ you are sighing to get rid of me!’ said the lady, in a reproachful, but still subdued tone. ‘Why, the fact is, Gertrude, I prefer calling upon you, to your calling upon me. When I am fitted for your society, I seek it; and, when you are good-tempered, always with pleasure; when I am not in the mood for it, I stay away. And when I am at home, I wish to see no one. I have business now, and not very agreeable business. I am disturbed by many causes, and you could not have taken a step which could have given me greater annoyance than the strange one you have adopted this evening.’ ‘I am sorry for it now,’ said the lady, weeping. ‘When shall I see you again?’ ‘I will call upon you tomorrow, and pray receive me with smiles.’ ‘I ever will,’ said the lady, weeping plenteously. ‘It is all my fault; you are ever too good. There is not in the world a kinder and more gentle being than yourself. I shall never forgive myself for this exposure. ‘Would you like to take anything?’ said Lord Cadurcis: ‘I am sure you must feel exhausted. You see I am drinking wine; it is my only dinner today, but I dare say there is some salvolatile in the house; I dare say, when my maids go into hysterics, they have it!’ ‘Ah, mocker!’ said Lady Monteagle; ‘but I can pardon everything, if you will only let me see you.’ ‘Au revoir! then,’ said his lordship; ‘I am sure the carriage must be ready. I hear it. Come, Mr. Gertrude, settle your wig; it is quite awry. By Jove! we might as well go to the Pantheon, as you are ready dressed. I have a domino.’ And so saying, Lord Cadurcis handed the lady to his carriage, and pressed her lightly by the hand, as he reiterated his promise of calling at Monteagle House the next day.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392/42314.html","bookId":1425,"book":{"id":1425,"title":"Venetia","description":"简介： Some ten years before the revolt of our American colonies, there was situate in one of our midland counties, on the borders of an extensive forest, an ancient hall that belonged to the Herberts, but which, though ever well preserved, had not until th...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM"}}
