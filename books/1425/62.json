{"id":14604,"no":62,"title":"Chapter 4.","content":"Just as Lady Annabel and her daughter arrived at Rovigo, one of those sudden and violent storms that occasionally occur at the termination of an Italian autumn raged with irresistible fury. The wind roared with a noise that overpowered the thunder; then came a rattling shower of hail, with stones as big as pigeons’ eggs, succeeded by rain, not in showers, but literally in cataracts. The only thing to which a tempest of rain in Italy can be compared is the bursting of a waterspout. Venetia could scarcely believe that this could be the same day of which the golden morning had found her among the sunny hills of Arqua. This unexpected vicissitude induced Lady Annabel to alter her plans, and she resolved to rest at Rovigo, where she was glad to find that they could be sheltered in a commodious inn. \n \n The building had originally been a palace, and in its halls and galleries, and the vast octagonal vestibule on which the principal apartments opened, it retained many noble indications of the purposes to which it was formerly destined. \n \n At present, a lazy innkeeper who did nothing; his bustling wife, who seemed equally at home in the saloon, the kitchen, and even the stable; and a solitary waiter, were the only inmates, except the Herberts, and a travelling party, who had arrived shortly after them, and who, like them, had been driven by stress of weather to seek refuge at a place where otherwise they had not intended to remain. \n \n A blazing fire of pine wood soon gave cheerfulness to the vast and somewhat desolate apartment into which our friends had been ushered; their sleeping-room was adjoining, but separated. In spite of the lamentations of Pauncefort, who had been drenched to the skin, and who required much more waiting upon than her mistress, Lady Annabel and Venetia at length produced some degree of comfort. They drew the table near the fire; they ensconced themselves behind an old screen; and, producing their books and work notwithstanding the tempest, they contrived to domesticate themselves at Rovigo. \n \n ‘I cannot help thinking of Arqua and its happy tenants, mamma,’ said Venetia. \n \n ‘And yet, perhaps, they may have their secret sorrows,’ said Lady Annabel. ‘I know not why, I always associate seclusion with unhappiness.’ \n \n Venetia remembered Cherbury. Their life at Cherbury was like the life of the German at Arqua. A chance visitor to Cherbury in their absence, viewing the beautiful residence and the fair domain, and listening to the tales which they well might hear of all her mother’s grace and goodness, might perhaps too envy its happy occupiers. But were they happy? Had they no secret sorrows? Was their seclusion associated with unhappiness? These were reflections that made Venetia grave; but she opened her journal, and, describing the adventures and feelings of the morning, she dissipated some mournful reminiscences. \n \n The storm still raged, Venetia had quitted the saloon in which her mother and herself had been sitting, and had repaired to the adjoining chamber to fetch a book. The door of this room opened, as all the other entrances of the different apartments, on to the octagonal vestibule. Just as she was quitting the room, and about to return to her mother, the door of the opposite chamber opened, and there came forward a gentleman in a Venetian dress of black velvet. His stature was much above the middle height, though his figure, which was remarkably slender, was bowed; not by years certainly, for his countenance, though singularly emaciated, still retained traces of youth. His hair, which he wore very long, descended over his shoulders, and must originally have been of a light golden colour, but now was severely touched with grey. His countenance was very pallid, so colourless indeed that its aspect was almost unearthly; but his large blue eyes, that were deeply set in his majestic brow, still glittered with fire, and their expression alone gave life to a visage, which, though singularly beautiful in its outline, from its faded and attenuated character seemed rather the countenance of a corpse than of a breathing being. \n \n The glance of the stranger caught that of Venetia, and seemed to fascinate her. She suddenly became motionless; wildly she stared at the stranger, who, in his turn, seemed arrested in his progress, and stood still as a statue, with his eyes fixed with absorbing interest on the beautiful apparition before him. An expression of perplexity and pain flitted over the amazed features of Venetia; and then it seemed that, by some almost supernatural effort, confusion amounting to stupefaction suddenly brightened and expanded into keen and overwhelming intelligence. Exclaiming in a frenzied tone, ‘My father!’ Venetia sprang forward, and fell senseless on the stranger’s breast. \n \n Such, after so much mystery, so many aspirations, so much anxiety, and so much suffering, such was the first meeting of Venetia Herbert with her father! \n \n Marmion Herbert, himself trembling and speechless, bore the apparently lifeless Venetia into his apartment. Not permitting her for a moment to quit his embrace, he seated himself, and gazed silently on the inanimate and unknown form he held so strangely within his arms. Those lips, now closed as if in death, had uttered however one word which thrilled to his heart, and still echoed, like a supernatural annunciation, within his ear. He examined with an eye of agitated scrutiny the fair features no longer sensible of his presence. He gazed upon that transparent brow, as if he would read some secret in its pellucid veins; and touched those long locks of golden hair with a trembling finger, that seemed to be wildly seeking for some vague and miraculous proof of inexpressible identity. The fair creature had called him ‘Father.’ His dreaming reveries had never pictured a being half so beautiful! She called him ‘Father!’ Tha word had touched his brain, as lightning cuts a tree. He looked around him with a distracted air, then gazed on the tranced form he held with a glance which would have penetrated her soul, and murmured unconsciously the wild word she had uttered. She called him ‘Father!’ He dared not think who she might be. His thoughts were wandering in a distant land; visions of another life, another country, rose before him, troubled and obscure. Baffled aspirations, and hopes blighted in the bud, and the cherished secrets of his lorn existence, clustered like clouds upon his perplexed, yet creative, brain. She called him, ‘Father!’ It was a word to make him mad. ‘Father!’ This beautiful being had called him ‘Father,’ and seemed to have expired, as it were, in the irresistible expression. His heart yearned to her; he had met her embrace with an inexplicable sympathy; her devotion had seemed, as it were, her duty and his right. Yet who was she? He was a father. It was a fact, a fact alike full of solace and mortification, the consciousness of which never deserted him. But he was the father of an unknown child; to him the child of his poetic dreams, rather than his reality. And now there came this radiant creature, and called him ‘Father!’ Was he awake, and in the harsh busy world; or was it the apparition of au over-excited imagination, brooding too constantly on one fond idea, on which he now gazed so fixedly? Was this some spirit? Would that she would speak again! Would that those sealed lips would part and utter but one word, would but again call him ‘Father,’ and he asked no more! \n \n ‘Father!’ to be called ‘Father’ by one whom he could not name, by one over whom he mused in solitude, by one to whom he had poured forth all the passion of his desolate soul; to be called ‘Father’ by this being was the aspiring secret of his life. He had painted her to himself in his loneliness, he had conjured up dreams of ineffable loveliness, and inexpressible love; he had led with her an imaginary life of thrilling tenderness; he had indulged in a delicious fancy of mutual interchange of the most exquisite offices of our nature; and then, when he had sometimes looked around him, and found no daughter there, no beaming countenance of purity to greet him with its constant smile, and receive the quick and ceaseless tribute of his vigilant affection, the tears had stolen down his lately-excited features, all the consoling beauty of his visions had vanished into air, he had felt the deep curse of his desolation, and had anathematised the cunning brain that made his misery a thousand-fold keener by the mockery of its transporting illusions. \n \n And now there came this transcendent creature, with a form more glowing than all his dreams; a voice more musical than a seraphic chorus, though it had uttered but one thrilling word: there came this transcendent creature, beaming with grace, beauty, and love, and had fallen upon his heart, and called him ‘Father!’ \n \n Herbert looked up to heaven as if waiting for some fresh miracle to terminate the harrowing suspense of his tortured mind; Herbert looked down upon his mysterious companion; the rose was gradually returning to her cheek, her lips seemed to tremble with reviving breath. There was only one word more strange to his ear than that which she had uttered, but an irresistible impulse sent forth the sound. \n \n ‘Venetia!’ he exclaimed. \n \n The eyes of the maiden slowly opened; she stared around her with a vague glance of perplexity, not unmingled with pain; she looked up; she caught the rapt gaze of her father, bending over her with fondness yet with fear; his lips moved, for a moment they refused to articulate, yet at length they again uttered, ‘Venetia!’ And the only response she made was to cling to him with nervous energy, and hide her face in his bosom. \n \n Herbert pressed her to his heart. Yet even now he hesitated to credit the incredible union. Again he called her by her name, but added with rising confidence, ‘My Venetia!’ \n \n ‘Your child, your child,’ she murmured. ‘Your own Venetia.’ \n \n He pressed his lips to hers; he breathed over her a thousand blessings; she felt his tears trickling on her neck. \n \n At length Venetia looked up and sighed; she was exhausted by the violence of her emotions: her father relaxed his grasp with infinite tenderness, watching her with delicate solicitude; she leaned her arm upon his shoulder with downcast eyes. \n \n Herbert gently took her disengaged hand, and pressed it to his lips. ‘I am as in a dream,’ murmured Venetia. \n \n ‘The daughter of my heart has found her sire,’ said Herbert in an impassioned voice. ‘The father who has long lived upon her fancied image; the father, I fear, she has been bred up to hate.’ \n \n ‘Oh! no, no!’ said Venetia, speaking rapidly and with a slight shiver; ‘not hate! it was a secret, his being was a secret, his name was never mentioned; it was unknown.’ \n \n ‘A secret! My existence a secret from my child, my beautiful fond child!’ exclaimed Herbert in a tone even more desolate than bitter. ‘Why did they not let you at least hate me!’ \n \n ‘My father!’ said Venetia, in a firmer voice, and with returning animation, yet gazing around her with a still distracted air, ‘Am I with my father? The clouds clear from my brain. I remember that we met. Where was it? Was it at Arqua? In the garden? I am with my father!’ she continued in a rapid tone and with a wild smile. ‘Oh! let me look on him;’ and she turned round, and gazed upon Herbert with a serious scrutiny. ‘Are you my father?’ she continued, in a still, small voice. ‘Your hair has grown grey since last I saw you; it was golden then, like mine. I know you are my father,’ she added, after a pause, and in a tone almost of gaiety. ‘You cannot deceive me. I know your name. They did not tell it me; I found it out myself, but it made me very ill, very; and I do not think I have ever been quite well since. You are Marmion Herbert. My mother had a dog called Marmion, when I was a little girl, but I did not know I had a father then.’ \n \n ‘Venetia!’ exclaimed Herbert, with streaming eyes, as he listened with anguish to these incoherent sentences. ‘My Venetia loves me!’ \n \n ‘Oh! she always loved you,’ replied Venetia; always, always. Before she knew her father she loved him. I dare say you think I do not love you, because I am not used to speak to a father. Everything must be learnt, you know,’ she said, with a faint, sad smile; ‘and then it was so sudden! I do not think my mother knows it yet. And after all, though I found you out in a moment, still, I know not why, I thought it was a picture. But I read your verses, and I knew them by heart at once; but now my memory has worn out, for I am ill, and everything has gone cross with me. And all because my father wrote me verses. ’Tis very strange, is not it?’ \n \n ‘Sweet lamb of my affections,’ exclaimed Herbert to himself, ‘I fear me much this sudden meeting with one from whose bosom you ought never to have been estranged, has been for the moment too great a trial for this delicate brain.’ \n \n ‘I will not tell my mother,’ said Venetia; ‘she will be angry.’ \n \n ‘Your mother, darling; where is your mother?’ said Herbert, looking, if possible, paler than he was wont. \n \n She was at Arqua with me, and on the lake for months, but where we are now, I cannot say. If I could only remember where we are now,’ she added with earnestness, and with a struggle to collect herself, ‘I should know everything.’ \n \n ‘This is Rovigo, my child, the inn of Rovigo. You are travelling with your mother. Is it not so?’ \n \n ‘Yes! and we came this morning, and it rained. Now I know everything,’ said Venetia, with an animated and even cheerful air. \n \n ‘And we met in the vestibule, my sweet,’ continued Herbert, in a soothing voice; ‘we came out of opposite chambers, and you knew me; my Venetia knew me. Try to tell me, my darling,’ he added, in a tone of coaxing fondness, ‘try to remember how Venetia knew her father.’ \n \n ‘He was so like his picture at Cherbury,’ replied Venetia. \n \n ‘Cherbury!’ exclaimed Herbert, with a deep-drawn sigh. \n \n ‘Only your hair has grown grey, dear father; but it is long, quite as long as in your picture.’ \n \n ‘Her dog called Marmion!’ murmured Herbert to himself, ‘and my portrait, too! You saw your father’s portrait, then, every day, love?’ \n \n ‘Oh, no! said Venetia, shaking her head, ‘only once, only once. And I never told mamma. It was where no one could go, but I went there one day. It was in a room that no one ever entered except mamma, but I entered it. I stole the key, and had a fever, and in my fever I confessed all. But I never knew it. Mamma never told me I confessed it, until many, many years afterwards. It was the first, the only time she ever mentioned to me your name, my father.’ \n \n ‘And she told you to shun me, to hate me? She told you I was a villain, a profligate, a demon? eh? eh? Was it not so, Venetia?’ \n \n ‘She told me that you had broken her heart,’ said Venetia; ‘and she prayed to God that her child might not be so miserable.’ \n \n ‘Oh, my Venetia!’ exclaimed Herbert, pressing her to his breast, and in a voice stifled with emotion, ‘I feel now we might have been happy!’ \n \n In the meantime the prolonged absence of her daughter surprised Lady Annabel. At length she rose, and walked into their adjoining apartment, but to her surprise Venetia was not there. Returning to her saloon, she found Pauncefort and the waiter arranging the table for dinner. \n \n ‘Where is Miss Herbert, Pauncefort?’ inquired Lady Annabel. \n \n ‘I am sure, my lady, I cannot say. I have no doubt she is in the other room.’ \n \n ‘She is not there, for I have just quitted it,’ replied Lady Annabel. ‘How very strange! You have not seen the signora?’ inquired Lady Annabel of the waiter. \n \n ‘The signora is in the room with the gentleman.’ \n \n ‘The gentleman!’ exclaimed Lady Annabel. ‘Tell me, good man, what do you mean? I am inquiring for my daughter.’ \n \n ‘I know well the signora is talking of her daughter,’ replied the waiter. \n \n ‘But do you know my daughter by sight? Surely you you must mean some one else.’ \n \n ‘Do I know the signora’s daughter?’ said the waiter. ‘The beautiful young lady, with hair like Santa Marguerita, in the church of the Holy Trinity! I tell the signora, I saw her carried into numero 4, in the arms of the Signor Forestiere, who arrived this morning.’ \n \n ‘Venetia is ill,’ said Lady Annabel. ‘Show me to the room, my friend.’ \n \n Lady Annabel accordingly, with a hurried step, following her guide, quitted the chamber. Pauncefort remained fixed to the earth, the very picture of perplexity. \n \n ‘Well, to be sure!’ she exclaimed, ‘was anything ever so strange! In the arms of Signor Forestiere! Forestiere. An English name. There is no person of the name of Forest that I know. And in his arms, too! I should not wonder if it was my lord after all. Well, I should be glad if he were to come to light again, for, after all, my lady may say what she likes, but if Miss Venetia don’t marry Lord Cadurcis, I must say marriages were never made in heaven!’ \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392/42321.html","bookId":1425,"book":{"id":1425,"title":"Venetia","description":"简介： Some ten years before the revolt of our American colonies, there was situate in one of our midland counties, on the borders of an extensive forest, an ancient hall that belonged to the Herberts, but which, though ever well preserved, had not until th...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM"}}
