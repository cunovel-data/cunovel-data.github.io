{"id":14556,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14.","content":"Towards evening Dr. Masham arrived at Cadurcis. He could give no intelligence of Plantagenet, who had not called at Marringhurst; but he offered, and was prepared, to undertake his pursuit. The good Doctor had his saddle-bags well stocked, and was now on his way to Southport, that being the nearest town, and where he doubted not to gain some tidings of the fugitive. Mrs. Cadurcis he found so indisposed, that he anticipated the charitable intentions of Lady Annabel not to quit her; and after having bid them place their confidence in Providence and his humble exertions, he at once departed on his researches. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the meantime let us return to the little lord himself. Having secured the advantage of a long start, by the device of turning the key of his chamber, he repaired to the stables, and finding no one to observe him, saddled his pony and galloped away without plan or purpose. An instinctive love of novelty and adventure induced him to direct his course by a road which he had never before pursued; and, after two or three miles progress through a wild open country of brushwood, he found that he had entered that considerable forest which formed the boundary of many of the views from Cadurcis. The afternoon was clear and still, the sun shining in the light blue sky, and the wind altogether hushed. On each side of the winding road spread the bright green turf, occasionally shaded by picturesque groups of doddered oaks. The calm beauty of the sylvan scene wonderfully touched the fancy of the youthful fugitive; it soothed and gratified him. He pulled up his pony; patted its lively neck, as if in gratitude for its good service, and, confident that he could not be successfully pursued, indulged in a thousand dreams of Robin Hood and his merry men. As for his own position and prospects, he gave himself no anxiety about them: satisfied with his escape from a revolting thraldom, his mind seemed to take a bound from the difficulty of his situation and the wildness of the scene, and he felt himself a man, and one, too, whom nothing could daunt or appal. \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon the road itself quite disappeared and vanished in a complete turfy track; but the continuing marks of cartwheels assured him that it was a thoroughfare, although he was now indeed journeying in the heart of a forest of oaks and he doubted not it would lead to some town or village, or at any rate to some farmhouse. Towards sunset, he determined to make use of the remaining light, and pushed on apace; but it soon grew so dark, that he found it necessary to resume his walking pace, from fear of the overhanging branches and the trunks of felled trees which occasionally crossed his way. \\n\\n \\n\\n Notwithstanding the probable prospect of passing his night in the forest, our little adventurer did not lose heart. Cadurcis was an intrepid child, and when in the company of those with whom he was not familiar, and free from those puerile associations to which those who had known and lived with him long were necessarily subject, he would assume a staid and firm demeanour unusual with one of such tender years. A light in the distance was now not only a signal that the shelter he desired was at hand, but reminded him that it was necessary, by his assured port, to prove that he was not unused to travel alone, and that he was perfectly competent and qualified to be his own master. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he drew nearer, the lights multiplied, and the moon, which now rose over the forest, showed to him that the trees, retiring on both sides to some little distance, left a circular plot of ground, on which were not only the lights which had at first attracted his attention, but the red flames of a watch-fire, round which some dark figures had hitherto been clustered. The sound of horses’ feet had disturbed them, and the fire was now more and more visible. As Cadurcis approached, he observed some low tents, and in a few minutes he was in the centre of an encampment of gipsies. He was for a moment somewhat dismayed, for he had been brought up with the usual terror of these wild people; nevertheless, he was not unequal to the occasion. He was surrounded in an instant, but only with women and children; for the gipsy-men never immediately appear. They smiled with their bright eyes, and the flames of the watch-fire threw a lurid glow over their dark and flashing countenances; they held out their practised hands; they uttered unintelligible, but not unfriendly sounds. The heart of Cadurcis faltered, but his voice did not betray him. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I am cold, good people,’ said the undaunted boy; ‘will you let me warm myself by your fire?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n A beautiful girl, with significant gestures, pressed her hand to her heart, then pointed in the direction of the tents, and then rushed away, soon reappearing with a short thin man, inclining to middle age, but of a compact and apparently powerful frame, lithe, supple, and sinewy. His complexion was dark, but clear; his eye large, liquid, and black; but his other features small, though precisely moulded. He wore a green jacket and a pair of black velvet breeches, his legs and feet being bare, with the exception of slippers. Round his head was twisted a red handkerchief, which, perhaps, might not have looked like a turban on a countenance less oriental. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘What would the young master?’ inquired the gipsy-man, in a voice far from disagreeable, and with a gesture of courtesy; but, at the same time, he shot a scrutinising glance first at Plantagenet, and then at his pony. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I would remain with you,’ said Cadurcis; ‘that is, if you will let me.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n The gipsy-man made a sign to the women, and Plantagenet was lifted by them off his pony, before he could be aware of their purpose; the children led the pony away, and the gipsy-man conducted Plantagenet to the fire, where an old woman sat, presiding over the mysteries of an enormous flesh-pot. Immediately his fellows, who had originally been clustered around it, reappeared; fresh blocks and branches were thrown on, the flames crackled and rose, the men seated themselves around, and Plantagenet, excited by the adventure, rubbed his hands before the fire, and determined to fear nothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n A savoury steam exuded from the flesh-pot. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘That smells well,’ said Plantagenet. \\n\\n \\n\\n ’Tis a dimber cove,’[A] whispered one of the younger men to a companion. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Footnote A: ’Tis a lively lad.] \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Our supper has but rough seasoning for such as you,’ said the man who had first saluted him, and who was apparently the leader; ‘but the welcome is hearty.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n The woman and girls now came with wooden bowls and platters, and, after serving the men, seated themselves in an exterior circle, the children playing round them. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Come, old mort,’ said the leader, in a very different tone to the one in which he addressed his young guest, ‘tout the cobble-colter; are we to have darkmans upon us? And, Beruna, flick the panam.’[A] \\n\\n \\n\\n [Footnote A: Come, old woman, took after the turkey. Are we to wait till night! And, Beruna, cut the bread.] \\n\\n \\n\\n Upon this, that beautiful girl, who had at first attracted the notice of Cadurcis, called out in a sweet lively voice, ‘Ay! ay! Morgana!’ and in a moment handed over the heads of the women a pannier of bread, which the leader took, and offered its contents to our fugitive. Cadurcis helped himself, with a bold but gracious air. The pannier was then passed round, and the old woman, opening the pot, drew out, with a huge iron fork, a fine turkey, which she tossed into a large wooden platter, and cut up with great quickness. First she helped Morgana, but only gained a reproof for her pains, who immediately yielded his portion to Plantagenet. Each man was provided with his knife, but the guest had none. Morgana immediately gave up his own. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Beruna!’ he shouted, ‘gibel a chiv for the gentry cove.’[A] \\n\\n \\n\\n [Footnote A: Bring a knife for the gentleman.] \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Ay! ay! Morgana!’ said the girl; and she brought the knife to Plantagenet himself, saying at the same time, with sparkling eyes, ‘Yam, yam, gentry cove.’[A] \\n\\n \\n\\n [Footnote A: Eat, eat, gentleman.] \\n\\n \\n\\n Cadurcis really thought it was the most delightful meal he had ever made in his life. The flesh-pot held something besides turkeys. Rough as was the fare, it was good and plentiful. As for beverage, they drank humpty-dumpty, which is ale boiled with brandy, and which is not one of the slightest charms of a gipsy’s life. When the men were satisfied, their platters were filled, and given to the women and children; and Beruna, with her portion, came and seated herself by Plantagenet, looking at him with a blended glance of delight and astonishment, like a beautiful young savage, and then turning to her female companions to stifle a laugh. The flesh-pot was carried away, the men lit their pipes, the fire was replenished, its red shadow mingled with the silver beams of the moon; around were the glittering tents and the silent woods; on all sides flashing eyes and picturesque forms. Cadurcis glanced at his companions, and gazed upon the scene with feelings of ravishing excitement; and then, almost unconscious of what he was saying, exclaimed, ‘At length I have found the life that suits me!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Indeed, squire!’ said Morgana. ‘Would you be one of us?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘From this moment,’ said Cadurcis, ‘if you will admit me to your band. But what can I do? And I have nothing to give you. You must teach me to earn my right to our supper.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘We’ll make a Turkey merchant[A] of you yet,’ said an old gipsy, ‘never fear that.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n [Footnote A: i.e. We will teach you to steal a turkey] \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Bah, Peter!’ said Morgana, with an angry look, ‘your red rag will never be still. And what was the purpose of your present travel?’ he continued to Plantagenet. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘None; I was sick of silly home.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘The gentry cove will be romboyled by his dam,’ said a third gipsy. ‘Queer Cuffin will be the word yet, if we don’t tout.’[A] \\n\\n \\n\\n [Footnote A: His mother will make a hue and cry after the gentleman yet; justice of the peace will be the word, if we don’t look sharp.] \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Well, you shall see a little more of us before you decide,’ said Morgana, thoughtfully, and turning the conversation. ‘Beruna.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Ay! ay! Morgana!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Tip me the clank, like a dimber mort as you are; trim a ken for the gentry cove; he is no lanspresado, or I am a kinchin.’[A] \\n\\n \\n\\n [Footnote A: Give me the tankard, like a pretty girl. Get a bed ready for the gentleman. He is no informer, or I am an infant.] \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Ay! ay! Morgana’ gaily exclaimed the girl, and she ran off to prepare a bed for the Lord of Cadurcis. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392/41715.html","bookId":1425,"book":{"id":1425,"title":"Venetia","description":"简介： Some ten years before the revolt of our American colonies, there was situate in one of our midland counties, on the borders of an extensive forest, an ancient hall that belonged to the Herberts, but which, though ever well preserved, had not until th...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM"}}
