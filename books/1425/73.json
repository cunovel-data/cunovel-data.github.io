Insensibly he drew Venetia from the rest of the party, on the pretence of showing her a view at some little distance. They walked along by the side of a rivulet, which glided through the hills, until they were nearly a mile from the villa, though still in sight. \n \n ‘Venetia,’ he at length said, turning the conversation to a more interesting topic, ‘your father and myself have disburthened our minds to each, other this morning; I think we know each other now as well as if we were as old acquaintances as myself and his daughter.’ \n \n ‘Ah! I knew that you and papa must agree,’ said Venetia; ‘I was saying so this morning to my mother.’ \n \n ‘Venetia,’ said Cadurcis, with a laughing eye, ‘all this is very strange, is it not?’ \n \n ‘Very strange, indeed, Plantagenet; I should not be surprised if it appeared to you as yet even incredible.’ \n \n ‘It is miraculous,’ said Cadurcis, ‘but not incredible; an angel interfered, and worked the miracle. I know all.’ \n \n Venetia looked at him with a faint flush upon her cheek; she gathered a flower and plucked it to pieces. \n \n ‘What a singular destiny ours has been, Venetia! ‘said Cadurcis. ‘Do you know, I can sit for an hour together and muse over it.’ \n \n ‘Can you, Plantagenet?’ \n \n ‘I have such an extraordinary memory; I do not think I ever forgot anything. We have had some remarkable conversations in our time, eh, Venetia? Do you remember my visit to Cherbury before I went to Cambridge, and the last time I saw you before I left England? And now it all ends in this! What do you think of it, Venetia?’ \n \n ‘Think of what, Plantagenet?’ \n \n ‘Why, of this reconciliation?’ \n \n ‘Dear Plantagenet, what can I think of it but what I have expressed, that it is a wonderful event, but the happiest in my life.’ \n \n ‘You are quite happy now?’ \n \n ‘Quite.’ \n \n ‘I see you do not care for me the least.’ \n \n ‘Plantagenet, you are perverse. Are you not here?’ \n \n ‘Did you ever think of me when I was away?’ \n \n ‘You know very well, Plantagenet, that it is impossible for me to cease to be interested in you. Could I refrain from thinking of such a friend?’ \n \n ‘Friend! poh! I am not your friend; and, as for that, you never once mentioned my name to your father, Miss Venetia.’ \n \n ‘You might easily conceive that there were reasons for such silence,’ said Venetia. ‘It could not arise on my part from forgetfulness or indifference; for, even if my feelings were changed towards you, you are not a person that one would, or even could, avoid speaking of, especially to papa, who must have felt such interest in you! I am sure, even if I had not known you, there were a thousand occasions which would have called your name to my lips, had they been uncontrolled by other considerations.’ \n \n ‘Come, Venetia, I am not going to submit to compliments from you,’ said Lord Cadurcis; ‘no blarney. I wish you only to think of me as you did ten years ago. I will not have our hearts polluted by the vulgarity of fame. I want you to feel for me as you did when we were children. I will not be an object of interest, and admiration, and fiddlestick to you; I will not submit to it.’ \n \n ‘Well, you shall not,’ said Venetia, laughing. ‘I will not admire you the least; I will only think of you as a good little boy.’ \n \n ‘You do not love me any longer, I see that,’ said Cadurcis. \n \n ‘Yes I do, Plantagenet.’ \n \n ‘You do not love me so much as you did the night before I went to Eton, and we sat over the fire? Ah! how often I have thought of that night when I was at Athens!’ he added in a tone of emotion. \n \n ‘Dear Plantagenet,’ said Venetia, ‘do not be silly. I am in the highest spirits in the world; I am quite gay with happiness, and all because you have returned. Do not spoil my pleasure.’ \n \n ‘Ah, Venetia! I see how it is; you have forgotten me, or worse than forgotten me.’ \n \n ‘Well, I am sure I do not know what to say to satisfy you,’ said Venetia. ‘I think you very unreasonable, and very ungrateful too, for I have always been your friend, Plantagenet, and I am sure you know it. You sent me a message before you went abroad.’ \n \n ‘Darling!’ said Lord Cadurcis, seizing her hand, ‘I am not ungrateful, I am not unreasonable. I adore you. You were very kind then, when all the world was against me. You shall see how I will pay them off, the dogs! and worse than dogs, their betters far; dogs are faithful. Do you remember poor old Marmion? How we were mystified, Venetia! Little did we think then who was Marmion’s godfather.’ \n \n Venetia smiled; but she said, ‘I do not like this bitterness of yours, Plantagenet. You have no cause to complain of the world, and you magnify a petty squabble with a contemptible coterie into a quarrel with a nation. It is not a wise humour, and, if you indulge it, it will not be a happy one.’ \n \n ‘I will do exactly what you wish on every subject, said Cadurcis, ‘if you will do exactly what I wish on one.’ \n \n ‘Well!’ said Venetia. \n \n ‘Once you told me,’ said Cadurcis, ‘that you would not marry me without the consent of your father; then, most unfairly, you added to your conditions the consent of your mother. Now both your parents are very opportunely at hand; let us fall down upon our knees, and beg their blessing.’ \n \n ‘O! my dear Plantagenet, I think it will be much better for me never to marry. We are both happy now; let us remain so. You can live here, and I can be your sister. Will not that do?’ \n \n ‘No, Venetia, it will not.’ \n \n ‘Dear Plantagenet!’ said Venetia with a faltering voice, ‘if you knew how much I had suffered, dear Plantagenet!’ \n \n ‘I know it; I know all,’ said Cadurcis, taking her arm and placing it tenderly in his. ‘Now listen to me, sweet girl; I loved you when a child, when I was unknown to the world, and unknown to myself; I loved you as a youth not utterly inexperienced in the world, and when my rising passions had taught me to speculate on the character of women; I loved you as a man, Venetia, with that world at my feet, that world which I scorn, but which I will command; I have been constant, Venetia; your heart assures you, of that. You are the only being in existence who exercises over me any influence; and the influence you possess is irresistible and eternal. It springs from some deep and mysterious sympathy of blood which I cannot penetrate. It can neither be increased nor diminished by time. It is entirely independent of its action. I pretend not to love you more at this moment than when I first saw you, when you entered the terrace-room at Cherbury and touched my cheek. From that moment I was yours. I declare to you, most solemnly I declare to you, that I know not what love is except to you. The world has called me a libertine; the truth is, no other woman can command my spirit for an hour. I see through them at a glance. I read all their weakness, frivolity, vanity, affectation, as if they were touched by the revealing rod of Asmodeus. You were born to be my bride. Unite yourself with me, control my destiny, and my course shall be like the sun of yesterday; but reject me, reject me, and I devote all my energies to the infernal gods; I will pour my lava over the earth until all that remains of my fatal and exhausted nature is a black and barren cone surrounded by bitter desolation.’ \n \n ‘Plantagenet; be calm!’ \n \n ‘I am perfectly calm, Venetia. You talk to me of your sufferings. What has occasioned them? A struggle against nature. Nature has now triumphed, and you are happy. What necessity was there for all this misery that has fallen on your house? Why is your father an exile? Do not you think that if your mother had chosen to exert her influence she might have prevented the most fatal part of his career? Undoubtedly despair impelled his actions as much as philosophy, though I give him credit for a pure and lofty spirit, to no man more. But not a murmur against your mother from me. She received my overtures of reconciliation last night with more than cordiality. She is your mother, Venetia, and she once was mine. Indeed, I love her; indeed, you would find that I would study her happiness. For after all, sweet, is there another woman in existence better qualified to fill the position of my mother-in-law? I could not behave unkindly to her; I could not treat her with neglect or harshness; not merely for the sake of her many admirable qualities, but from other considerations, Venetia, considerations we never can forget. By heavens! I love your mother; I do, indeed, Venetia! I remember so many things; her last words to me when I went to Eton. If she would only behave kindly to me, you would see what a son-in-law I should make. You would be jealous, that you should, Venetia. I can bear anything from you, Venetia, but, with others, I cannot forget who I am. It makes me bitter to be treated as Lady Annabel treated me last year in London: but a smile and a kind word and I recall all her maternal love; I do indeed, Venetia; last night when she was kind I could have kissed her!’ \n \n Poor Venetia could not answer, her tears were flowing so plenteously. ‘I have told your father all, sweetest,’ said Cadurcis; ‘I concealed nothing.’ \n \n ‘And what said he?’ murmured Venetia. \n \n ‘It rests with your mother. After all that has passed, he will not attempt to control your fate. And he is right. Perhaps his interference in my favour might even injure me. But there is no cause for despair; all I wanted was to come to an understanding with you; to be sure you loved me as you always have done. I will not be impatient. I will do everything to soothe and conciliate and gratify Lady Annabel; you will see how I will behave! As you say, too, we are happy because we are together; and, therefore, it would be unreasonable not to be patient. I never can be sufficiently grateful for this meeting. I concluded you would be in England, though we were on our way to Milan to inquire after you. George has been a great comfort to me in all this affair, Venetia; he loves you, Venetia, almost as much as I do. I think I should have gone mad during that cursed affair in England, had it not been for George. I thought you would hate me; but, when George brought me your message, I cared for nothing; and then his visit to the lake was so devilish kind! He is a noble fellow and a true friend. My sweet, sweet Venetia, dry your eyes. Let us rejoin them with a smile. We have not been long away, I will pretend we have been violet hunting,’ said Cadurcis, stooping down and plucking up a handful of flowers. ‘Do you remember our violets at home, Venetia? Do you know, Venetia, I always fancy every human being is like some object in nature; and you always put me in mind of a violet so fresh and sweet and delicate!’ \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392/42332.html","bookId":1425,"book":{"id":1425,"title":"Venetia","description":"简介： Some ten years before the revolt of our American colonies, there was situate in one of our midland counties, on the borders of an extensive forest, an ancient hall that belonged to the Herberts, but which, though ever well preserved, had not until th...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM"}}
