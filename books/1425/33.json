I thought we were never going to see you again!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You know I told you I should return; and now I mean never to leave you again.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Never is a long word, my lord,’ said Mistress Pauncefort, looking very archly. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Ah! but I mean to settle, regularly to settle here,’ said Lord Cadurcis. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Marry and settle, my lord,’ said Mistress Pauncefort, still more arch. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘And why not?’ inquired Lord Cadurcis, laughing. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘That is just what I said last night,’ exclaimed Mistress Pauncefort, eagerly. ‘And why not? for I said, says I, his lordship must marry sooner or later, and the sooner the better, say I: and to be sure he is very young, but what of that? for, says I, no one can say he does not look quite a man. And really, my lord, saving your presence, you are grown indeed.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Pish!’ said Lord Cadurcis, turning away and laughing, ‘I have left off growing, Pauncefort, and all those sort of things.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You have not forgotten our last visit to Marringhurst?’ said Lord Cadurcis to Venetia, as the comfortable mansion of the worthy Doctor appeared in sight. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I have forgotten nothing,’ replied Venetia with a faint smile; ‘I do not know what it is to forget. My life has been so uneventful that every past incident, however slight, is as fresh in my memory as if it occurred yesterday.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Then you remember the strawberries and cream?’ said Lord Cadurcis. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘And other circumstances less agreeable,’ he fancied Venetia observed, but her voice was low. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Do you know, Lady Annabel,’ said Lord Cadurcis, ‘that I was very nearly riding my pony today? I wish to bring back old times with the utmost possible completeness; I wish for a moment to believe that I have never quitted Cherbury.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Let us think only of the present now,’ said Lady Annabel in a cheerful voice, ‘for it is very agreeable. I see the good Doctor; he has discovered us.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I wonder whom he fancies Lord Cadurcis to be?’ said Venetia. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Have you no occasional cavalier for whom at a distance I may be mistaken?’ inquired his lordship in a tone of affected carelessness, though in truth it was an inquiry that he made not without anxiety. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Everything remains here exactly as you left it,’ replied Lady Annabel, with some quickness, yet in a lively tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Happy Cherbury!’ exclaimed Lord Cadurcis. ‘May it indeed never change!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n They rode briskly on; the Doctor was standing at his gate. He saluted Lady Annabel and Venetia with his accustomed cordiality, and then stared at their companion as if waiting for an introduction. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You forget an old friend, my dear Doctor,’ said Cadurcis. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Lord Cadurcis!’ exclaimed Dr. Masham. His lordship had by this time dismounted and eagerly extended his hand to his old tutor. \\n\\n \\n\\n Having quitted their horses they all entered the house, nor was there naturally any want of conversation. Cadurcis had much information to give and many questions to answer. He was in the highest spirits and the most amiable mood; gay, amusing, and overflowing with kind-heartedness. The Doctor seldom required any inspiration, to be joyous, and Lady Annabel was unusually animated. Venetia alone, though cheerful, was calmer than pleased Cadurcis. Time, he sorrowfully observed, had occasioned a greater change in her manner than he could have expected. Youthful as she still was, indeed but on the threshold of womanhood, and exempted, as it seemed she had been, from anything to disturb the clearness of her mind, that enchanting play of fancy which had once characterised her, and which he recalled with a sigh, appeared in a great degree to have deserted her. He watched her countenance with emotion, and, supremely beautiful as it undeniably was, there was a cast of thoughtfulness or suffering impressed upon the features which rendered him mournful he knew not why, and caused him to feel as if a cloud had stolen unexpectedly over the sun and made him shiver. \\n\\n \\n\\n But there was no time or opportunity for sad reflections; he had to renew his acquaintance with all the sights and curiosities of the rectory, to sing to the canaries, and visit the gold fish, admire the stuffed fox, and wonder that in the space of five years the voracious otter had not yet contrived to devour its prey. Then they refreshed themselves after their ride with a stroll in the Doctor’s garden; Cadurcis persisted in attaching himself to Venetia, as in old days, and nothing would prevent him from leading her to the grotto. Lady Annabel walked behind, leaning on the Doctor’s arm, narrating, with no fear of being heard, all the history of their friend’s return. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I never was so surprised in my life,’ said the Doctor; ‘he is vastly improved; he is quite a man; his carriage is very finished.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘And his principles,’ said Lady Annabel. ‘You have no idea, my dear Doctor, how right his opinions seem to be on every subject. He has been brought up in a good school; he does his guardian great credit. He is quite loyal and orthodox in all his opinions; ready to risk his life for our blessed constitution in Church and State. He requested, as a favour, that he might remain at our prayers last night. It is delightful for me to see him turn out so well!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n In the meantime Cadurcis and Venetia entered the grotto. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘The dear Doctor!’ said Cadurcis: ‘five years have brought no visible change even to him; perhaps he may be a degree less agile, but I will not believe it. And Lady Annabel; it seems to me your mother is more youthful and beautiful than ever. There is a spell in our air,’ continued his lordship, with a laughing eye; ‘for if we have changed, Venetia, ours is, at least, an alteration that bears no sign of decay. We are advancing, but they have not declined; we are all enchanted.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I feel changed,’ said Venetia gravely. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I left you a child and I find you a woman,’ said Lord Cadurcis, ‘a change which who can regret?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I would I were a child again,’ said Venetia. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘We were happy,’ said Lord Cadurcis, in a thoughtful tone; and then in an inquiring voice he added, ‘and so we are now?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Venetia shook her head. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Can you be unhappy?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘To be unhappy would be wicked,’ said Venetia; ‘but my mind has lost its spring.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Ah! say not so, Venetia, or you will make even me gloomy. I am happy, positively happy. There must not be a cloud upon your brow.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You are joyous,’ said Venetia, ‘because you are excited. It is the novelty of return that animates you. It will wear off; you will grow weary, and when you go to the university you will think yourself happy again.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I do not intend to go to the university,’ said Cadurcis. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I understood from you that you were going there immediately.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘My plans are changed,’ said Cadurcis; ‘I do not intend ever to leave home again.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘When you go to Cambridge,’ said Dr. Masham, who just then reached them, ‘I shall trouble you with a letter to an old friend of mine whose acquaintance you may find valuable.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Venetia smiled; Cadurcis bowed, expressed his thanks, and muttered something about talking over the subject with the Doctor. \\n\\n \\n\\n After this the conversation became general, and at length they all returned to the house to partake of the Doctor’s hospitality, who promised to dine at the hall on the morrow. The ride home was agreeable and animated, but the conversation on the part of the ladies was principally maintained by Lady Annabel, who seemed every moment more delighted with the society of Lord Cadurcis, and to sympathise every instant more completely with his frank exposition of his opinions on all subjects. When they returned to Cherbury, Cadurcis remained with them as a matter of course. An invitation was neither expected nor given. Not an allusion was made to the sports of the field, to enjoy which was the original purpose of his visit to the abbey; and he spoke of tomorrow as of a period which, as usual, was to be spent entirely in their society. He remained with them, as on the previous night, to the latest possible moment. Although reserved in society, no one could be more fluent with those with whom he was perfectly unembarrassed. He was indeed exceedingly entertaining, and Lady Annabel relaxed into conversation beyond her custom. As for Venetia, she did not speak often, but she listened with interest, and was evidently amused. When Cadurcis bade them good-night Lady Annabel begged him to breakfast with them; while Venetia, serene, though kind, neither seconded the invitation, nor seemed interested one way or the other in its result. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392/41734.html","bookId":1425,"book":{"id":1425,"title":"Venetia","description":"简介： Some ten years before the revolt of our American colonies, there was situate in one of our midland counties, on the borders of an extensive forest, an ancient hall that belonged to the Herberts, but which, though ever well preserved, had not until th...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM"}}
