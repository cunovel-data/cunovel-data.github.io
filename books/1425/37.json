Cadurcis, without hesitation, offered his arm to Venetia, and whether from a secret sympathy with his wishes, or merely from some fortunate accident, Lady Annabel and Dr. Masham strolled on before without busying themselves too earnestly with their companions. ‘And how do you think our expedition to Cadurcis has turned out?’ inquired the young lord, of Venetia, ‘Has it been successful?’ ‘It has been one of the most agreeable days I ever passed,’ was the reply. ‘Then it has been successful,’ rejoined his lordship; ‘for my only wish was to amuse you.’ ‘I think we have all been equally amused,’ said Venetia. ‘I never knew mamma in such good spirits. I think ever since you returned she has been unusually light-hearted.’ ‘And you: has my return lightened only her heart, Venetia?’ ‘Indeed it has contributed to the happiness of every one.’ ‘And yet, when I first returned, I heard you utter a complaint; the first that to my knowledge ever escaped your lips.’ ‘Ah! we cannot be always equally gay.’ ‘Once you were, dear Venetia.’ ‘I was a child then.’ ‘And I, I too was a child; yet I am happy, at least now that I am with you.’ ‘Well, we are both happy now.’ ‘Oh! say that again, say that again, Venetia; for indeed you made me miserable when you told me that you had changed. I cannot bear that you, Venetia, should ever change.’ ‘It is the course of nature, Plantagenet; we all change, everything changes. This day that was so bright is changing fast.’ ‘The stars are as beautiful as the sun, Venetia.’ ‘And what do you infer?’ ‘That Venetia, a woman, is as beautiful as Venetia, a little girl; and should be as happy.’ ‘Is beauty happiness, Plantagenet?’ ‘It makes others happy, Venetia; and when we make others happy we should be happy ourselves.’ ‘Few depend upon my influence, and I trust all of them are happy.’ ‘No one depends upon your influence more than I do.’ ‘Well, then, be happy always.’ ‘Would that I might! Ah, Venetia! can I ever forget old days? You were the solace of my dark childhood; you were the charm that first taught me existence was enjoyment. Before I came to Cherbury I never was happy, and since that hour — Ah, Venetia! dear, dearest Venetia! who is like to you?’ ‘Dear Plantagenet, you were always too kind to me. Would we were children once more!’ ‘Nay, my own Venetia! you tell me everything changes, and we must not murmur at the course of nature. I would not have our childhood back again, even with all its joys, for there are others yet in store for us, not less pure, not less beautiful. We loved each other then, Venetia, and we love each other now.’ ‘My feelings towards you have never changed, Plantagenet; I heard of you always with interest, and I met you again with heartfelt pleasure.’ ‘Oh, that morning! Have you forgotten that morning? Do you know, you will smile very much, but I really believe that I expected to see my Venetia still a little girl, the very same who greeted me when I first arrived with my mother and behaved so naughtily! And when I saw you, and found what you had become, and what I ought always to have known you must become, I was so confused I entirely lost my presence of mind. You must have thought me very awkward, very stupid?’ ‘Indeed, I was rather gratified by observing that you could not meet us again without emotion. I thought it told well for your heart, which I always believed to be most kind, at least, I am sure, to us.’ ‘Kind! oh, Venetia! that word but ill describes what my heart ever was, what it now is, to you. Venetia! dearest, sweetest Venetia! can you doubt for a moment my feelings towards your home, and what influence must principally impel them? Am I so dull, or you so blind, Venetia? Can I not express, can you not discover how much, how ardently, how fondly, how devotedly, I, I, I love you?’ ‘I am sure we always loved each other, Plantagenet.’ ‘Yes! but not with this love; not as I love you now!’ Venetia stared. ‘I thought we could not love each other more than we did, Plantagenet,’ at length she said. ‘Do you remember the jewel that you gave me? I always wore it until you seemed to forget us, and then I thought it looked so foolish! You remember what is inscribed on it: ‘TO VENETIA, FROM HER AFFECTIONATE BROTHER, PLANTAGENET.’ And as a brother I always loved you; had I indeed been your sister I could not have loved you more warmly and more truly.’ ‘I am not your brother, Venetia; I wish not to be loved as a brother: and yet I must be loved by you, or I shall die.’ ‘What then do you wish?’ inquired Venetia, with great simplicity. ‘I wish you to marry me,’ replied Lord Cadurcis. ‘Marry!’ exclaimed Venetia, with a face of wonder. ‘Marry! Marry you! Marry you, Plantagenet!’ ‘Ay! is that so wonderful? I love you, and if you love me, why should we not marry?’ Venetia was silent and looked upon the ground, not from agitation, for she was quite calm, but in thought; and then she said, ‘I never thought of marriage in my life, Plantagenet; I have no intention, no wish to marry; I mean to live always with mamma.’ ‘And you shall always live with mamma, but that need not prevent you from marrying me,’ he replied. ‘Do not we all live together now? What will it signify if you dwell at Cadurcis and Lady Annabel at Cherbury? Is it not one home? But at any rate, this point shall not be an obstacle; for if it please you we will all live at Cherbury.’ ‘You say that we are happy now, Plantagenet; oh! let us remain as we are.’ ‘My own sweet girl, my sister, if you please, any title, so it be one of fondness, your sweet simplicity charms me; but, believe me, it cannot be as you wish; we cannot remain as we are unless we marry.’ ‘Why not?’ ‘Because I shall be wretched and must live elsewhere, if indeed I can live at all.’ ‘Oh, Plantagenet! indeed I thought you were my brother; when I found you after so long a separation as kind as in old days, and kinder still, I was so glad; I was so sure you loved me; I thought I had the kindest brother in the world. Let us not talk of any other love. It will, indeed it will, make mamma so miserable!’ ‘I am greatly mistaken,’ replied Lord Cadurcis, who saw no obstacles to his hopes in their conversation hitherto, ‘if, on the contrary, our union would not prove far from disagreeable to your mother, Venetia; I will say our mother, for indeed to me she has been one.’ ‘Plantagenet,’ said Venetia, in a very earnest tone, ‘I love you very much; but, if you love me, press me on this subject no more at present. You have surprised, indeed you have bewildered me. There are thoughts, there are feelings, there are considerations, that must be respected, that must influence me. Nay! do not look so sorrowful, Plantagenet. Let us be happy now. To-morrow, only tomorrow, and tomorrow we are sure to meet, we will speak further of all this; but now, now, for a moment let us forget it, if we can forget anything so strange. Nay! you shall smile!’ He did. Who could resist that mild and winning glance! And indeed Lord Cadurcis was scarcely disappointed, and not at all mortified at his reception, or, as he esteemed it, the progress of his suit. The conduct of Venetia he attributed entirely to her unsophisticated nature and the timidity of a virgin soul. It made him prize even more dearly the treasure that he believed awaited him. Silent, then, though for a time they both struggled to speak on different subjects, silent, and almost content, Cadurcis proceeded, with the arm of Venetia locked in his and ever and anon unconsciously pressing it to his heart. The rosy twilight had faded away, the stars were stealing forth, and the moon again glittered. With a soul softer than the tinted shades of eve and glowing like the heavens, Cadurcis joined his companions as they entered the gardens of Cherbury. When they had arrived at home it seemed that exhaustion had suddenly succeeded all the excitement of the day. The Doctor, who was wearied, retired immediately. Lady Annabel pressed Cadurcis to remain and take tea, or, at least to ride home; but his lordship, protesting that he was not in the slightest degree fatigued, and anticipating their speedy union on the morrow, bade her good night, and pressing with fondness the hand of Venetia, retraced his steps to the now solitary abbey.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392/41738.html","bookId":1425,"book":{"id":1425,"title":"Venetia","description":"简介： Some ten years before the revolt of our American colonies, there was situate in one of our midland counties, on the borders of an extensive forest, an ancient hall that belonged to the Herberts, but which, though ever well preserved, had not until th...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1392","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:05 AM"}}
