{"id":1903,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"3:1 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 还 有 话 说 ， 请 你 们 为 我 们 祷 告 ， 好 叫 主 的 道 理 快 快 行 开 ， 得 着 荣 耀 ， 正 如 在 你 们 中 间 一 样 。 [kjv] Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: [bbe] For the rest, my brothers, let there be prayer for us that the word of the Lord may go forward with increasing glory, even as it does with you; 3:2 [hgb] 也 叫 我 们 脱 离 无 理 之 恶 人 的 手 。 因 为 人 不 都 是 有 信 心 。 [kjv] And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith. [bbe] And that we may be made free from foolish and evil men; for not all have faith. 3:3 [hgb] 但 主 是 信 实 的 ， 要 坚 固 你 们 ， 保 护 你 们 脱 离 那 恶 者 。 （ 或 作 脱 离 凶 恶 ） [kjv] But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil. [bbe] But the Lord is true, who will give you strength and keep you safe from evil. 3:4 [hgb] 我 们 靠 主 深 信 你 们 现 在 是 遵 行 我 们 所 吩 咐 的 ， 后 来 也 必 要 遵 行 。 [kjv] And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you. [bbe] And we have faith in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things about which we give you orders. 3:5 [hgb] 愿 主 引 导 你 们 的 心 ， 叫 你 们 爱 神 并 学 基 督 的 忍 耐 。 [kjv] And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ. [bbe] And may your hearts be guided by the Lord into the love of God and quiet waiting for Christ. 3:6 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 们 奉 主 耶 稣 基 督 的 名 吩 咐 你 们 ， 凡 有 弟 兄 不 按 规 矩 而 行 ， 不 遵 守 从 我 们 所 受 的 教 训 ， 就 当 远 离 他 。 [kjv] Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. [bbe] Now we give you orders, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from all those whose behaviour is not well ordered and in harmony with the teaching which they had from us. 3:7 [hgb] 你 们 自 己 原 知 道 应 当 怎 样 效 法 我 们 。 因 为 我 们 在 你 们 中 间 ， 未 尝 不 按 规 矩 而 行 。 [kjv] For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; [bbe] For you yourselves are used to taking us as your example, because our life among you was ruled by order, 3:8 [hgb] 也 未 尝 白 吃 人 的 饭 。 倒 是 辛 苦 劳 碌 ， 昼 夜 作 工 ， 免 得 叫 你 们 一 人 受 累 。 [kjv] Neither did we eat any man\u0027s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you: [bbe] And we did not take food from any man for nothing, but were working hard night and day not to be a trouble to any of you: 3:9 [hgb] 这 并 不 是 因 我 们 没 有 权 柄 ， 乃 是 要 给 你 们 作 榜 样 ， 叫 你 们 效 法 我 们 。 [kjv] Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us. [bbe] Not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, so that you might do the same. 3:10 [hgb] 我 们 在 你 们 那 里 的 时 候 ， 曾 吩 咐 你 们 说 ， 若 有 人 不 肯 作 工 ， 就 不 可 吃 饭 。 [kjv] For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. [bbe] For even when we were with you we gave you orders, saying, If any man does no work, let him not have food. 3:11 [hgb] 因 我 们 听 说 ， 在 你 们 中 间 有 人 不 按 规 矩 而 行 ， 什 么 工 都 不 作 ， 反 倒 专 管 闲 事 。 [kjv] For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. [bbe] For it has come to our ears that there are some among you whose behaviour is uncontrolled, who do no work at all, but are over-interested in the business of others. 3:12 [hgb] 我 们 靠 主 耶 稣 基 督 ， 吩 咐 劝 戒 这 样 的 人 ， 要 安 静 作 工 ， 吃 自 己 的 饭 。 [kjv] Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. [bbe] Now to such we give orders and make request in the Lord Jesus, that, working quietly, they get their living. 3:13 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 你 们 行 善 不 可 丧 志 。 [kjv] But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing. [bbe] And you, my brothers, do not get tired of well-doing. 3:14 [hgb] 若 有 人 不 听 从 我 们 这 信 上 的 话 ， 要 记 下 他 ， 不 和 他 交 往 ， 叫 他 自 觉 羞 愧 。 [kjv] And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. [bbe] And if any man does not give attention to what we have said in this letter, take note of that man, and keep away from him, so that he may be shamed. 3:15 [hgb] 但 不 要 以 他 为 仇 人 ， 要 劝 他 如 弟 兄 。 [kjv] Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. [bbe] Have no feeling of hate for him, but take him in hand seriously as a brother. 3:16 [hgb] 愿 赐 平 安 的 主 ， 随 时 随 事 亲 自 给 你 们 平 安 。 愿 主 常 与 你 们 众 人 同 在 。 [kjv] Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all. [bbe] Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. May the Lord be with you all. 3:17 [hgb] 我 保 罗 亲 笔 问 你 们 安 。 凡 我 的 信 都 以 此 为 记 。 我 的 笔 迹 就 是 这 样 。 [kjv] The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. [bbe] These words of love to you at the end are in my writing, Paul\u0027s writing, and this is the mark of every letter from me. 3:18 [hgb] 愿 我 们 主 耶 稣 基 督 的 恩 ， 常 与 你 们 众 人 同 在 。 [kjv] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. [bbe] May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/174/2317.html","bookId":69,"book":{"id":69,"title":"帖撒罗尼迦后书 2 Thessalonians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 保 罗 ， 西 拉 ， 提 摩 太 ， 写 信 给 帖 撒 罗 尼 迦 在 神 我 们 的 父 ， 与 主 耶 稣 基 督 里 的 教 会 。 [kjv] Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and th...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/174","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
