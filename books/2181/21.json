{"id":99842,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"In desperation the Shadow clambers after me, but a funnel has formed in the water beneath the broken lodestone. It stretches far down and whirls violently, creating a magical vacuum which drags at the mass of shadows. The beast\u0027s rear tentacles are stiff behind it, drawn towards the vortex, and its body begins to lengthen and narrow. The creature strains against it, but the vacuum is too strong. There are laws which even the Shadow has to obey, at least for the time being. In a rush, and with a hateful shriek, the Shadow\u0027s ripped away. It smashes through the lodestone, shattering the remains of the rock, and disappears down the funnel, howling all the way. Moments later the funnel collapses in on itself as swiftly as it formed. I want to rush to Beranabus\u0027s corpse and bid him farewell. I\u0027m weeping and all I want is to be by my dead friend\u0027s side. But that\u0027s not possible. Because now that the lodestone\u0027s magic has evaporated, the shield keeping the sea at bay has started to give way. The fragments of the lodestone fall first, trickling through cracks in the invisible barrier. Water seeps up through the cracks, spreading neatly across the surface of the shield. Then one of the living dead stumbles and drops out of sight as if crashing through a thin layer of ice. \"Let\u0027s get the hell out of here!\" Dervish shouts, hauling me through the door. \"Beranabus!\" I cry. \"We can\u0027t help him now,\" Dervish pants. As he says it, the shield flickers out of existence and water floods the hold. The ship lurches. A wave of foaming water surges towards us, washing away the helpless bodies of the zombies. We should be washed away too, but Sharmila acts swiftly to avert catastrophe, establishing a barrier around us and the doorway. The wave breaks and seethes away, the sea temporarily cheated of its victims. \"Quick,\" Sharmila gasps, hopping up the stairs. \"The magic is fading. The barrier will not hold.\" She\u0027s right. I can feel the energy ebbing away at a frightening rate. I look one last time for the body of Beranabus, but the ocean has already claimed it. Wiping tears from my cheeks, I hurry after Dervish and Sharmila, knowing that if we don\u0027t climb sharply, we\u0027ll soon be joining Beranabus in his watery grave. We move a lot slower going up than we did coming down. It\u0027s not just the fact that we\u0027re climbing. We\u0027re tired and drained. We were fine when the air was thick with magic, but the unnatural energy is fading fast. We\u0027re halfway up the second flight of stairs when I hear the sea gush up the corridors behind us. I\u0027ve no idea how long we have. I imagine it would usually take a ship this size at least a couple of hours sink, but the hole in the hull was extremely large. The zombies are still going strong. The strange magic of the Shadow which reanimated them is fading slower than the energy we were tapping into. While we\u0027re rapidly weakening, the zombies haven\u0027t been significantly affected. We don\u0027t use bolts of magic anymore, or arrogantly dismiss them with a wave of a hand. We\u0027re reduced to close-quarters fighting. We can still repel them with our charged fists and feet-the magic hasn\u0027t disappeared entirely-but there are thousands of zombies. If we\u0027re still here when the last of the energy fades, they\u0027ll swamp us. Unless the sea claims us first. Sharmila\u0027s second leg fragments. She pumps magic into it to hold the bones and scraps of flesh together. \"Don\u0027t bother,\" Dervish grunts, lifting her. \"Save your strength. Get on my back. I\u0027ll be your legs. You keep the zombies off.\" \"What about your heart?\" Sharmila shouts. \"It\u0027ll hold for a while.\" I can move much quicker than Dervish now that he\u0027s burdened with Sharmila. I\u0027m tempted to race ahead of them, up through the ship, away from the encroaching water. But they\u0027re my friends and they wouldn\u0027t desert me if I was in their position. If it becomes necessary to flee, I will. But as long as there\u0027s a chance we might all make it out alive, I\u0027ll stick with them. I take the lead, knocking flailing, snarling zombies out of our way, pushing ahead, the undead humans crowding the staircase behind and in front. I should feel fear in the face of such warped, nightmarish foes, but my emotions are focused on Beranabus-there\u0027s only room within me for mourning. I can\u0027t believe he\u0027s dead. It\u0027s hard to imagine a world without the ancient magician. He\u0027s been mankind\u0027s saviour for longer than anyone should have to serve. What will we do without him? I doubt the Disciples can repel the waves of Demonata attacks by themselves. Beranabus believed our universe created heroes in times of need. If that\u0027s true, perhaps someone will replace him. But it\u0027s hard to picture anybody taking the magician\u0027s place. He was one of a kind. We hit another level. I\u0027m about to lurch up the next set of stairs when I spot Kirilli Kovacs tussling with a gaggle of zombies. He\u0027s in bad shape, bitten and scratched all over. A dozen of the living dead surround him. I should leave him. He doesn\u0027t really deserve to be rescued and I can\u0027t afford to waste any of my dwindling power. But I can\u0027t turn my back on a man just because he\u0027s a coward. Kirilli didn\u0027t betray or undermine us-he simply gave in to fear, as many people would have. Drawing on my reserves, I mutter a spell and gesture at the zombies packed around Kirilli. They fly apart and a path opens. \"Run!\" I yell. Kirilli doesn\u0027t need to be told twice. He stumbles clear of the zombies and is by my side moments later. Blood cakes his face, but his eyes are alert behind the red veil. He starts to say something. \"No time for talking,\" I snap. \"Get up those stairs quick, and if you fall, I\u0027ll leave you.\" Kirilli flinches, draws a breath, then darts ahead of me, taking pole position, staggering up the seemingly endless flights of steps towards the upper deck and its promise of escape. As we\u0027re forcing our way up another staircase clogged with zombies, Dervish gasps and collapses to his knees. One hand darts to his chest. I think it\u0027s the end of him, but Sharmila presses her hands over his and channels magic into his heart. She pulls a stricken face as she helps-the magic she\u0027s directing into his flesh means she has less to ward off the pain in her legs. But she has no real choice. Without Dervish to carry her, she\u0027s doomed. Kirilli is struggling with the zombies. He\u0027s weak and afraid. He lashes out at them wildly, not preserving his energy or channelling it wisely. I\u0027ve tried warning him, but he either doesn\u0027t hear me or can\u0027t respond. He knows only one thing-he has to go up. That\u0027s tattooed on his brain, driving him on. Thankfully the walking corpses are moving more like regular zombies now. Their magic is fading. The attacks are clumsier, less coordinated. But they\u0027re still on their feet, our scent thick in their nostrils, licking their lips at the thought of biting into our soft, juicy brains. As we hit the last step of another flight, Kirilli screams something unintelligible. I\u0027m exhausted, but I push forward in reply to his cry, fearing the worst. But when I clear the step, I realise it was a yell of exhilaration, not dismay. We\u0027re back at the upper deck. The ship is lurching at a worrying angle, and the deck is littered with hordes of zombies. But we get a fresh burst of hope when we breathe the fresh, salty air. Dervish lays Sharmila down and squats beside her. \"I need... a minute,\" he wheezes, face ashen, rubbing his chest. \"We can\u0027t stop,\" Kirilli shrieks, knocking over a zombie in uniform who\u0027s either the ship\u0027s captain or a highly placed mate. \"Shut up,\" I growl and crouch next to Dervish. \"Let me help.\" \"No,\" he mutters. \"Save your magic... for yourself.\" \"Don\u0027t be a fool.\" I shove his hands away and rest my left palm on his chest. I pump magic into him, enough to keep him ticking over. \"Do you know the way back to Kernel?\" Sharmila asks, wincing from the pain in her thighs. They\u0027re bleeding at the stumps, the flesh we knotted together in the demon universe coming undone. \"Yes.\" I grin at her. \"Perfect memory, remember?\" She returns the smile, but shakily. \"Perhaps you should leave me here.\" \"We\u0027re not leaving anyone behind,\" I say firmly. \"Except maybe Kirilli.\" He stares at me with a wounded expression. \"I hope you don\u0027t-\" he starts. \"Not now,\" I stop him. My cheeks are dry. I must have stopped weeping at some point coming up the stairs. The ship is slipping further into the water. The angle of the deck to the sea is increasing steadily. Kernel\u0027s at the end of the ship which is rising. If we don\u0027t act quickly, we won\u0027t make it. \"Come on,\" I command. \"One last push. We can rest once we slip through the window.\" Dervish sighs wearily but staggers to his feet. He reaches for Sharmila. \"Wait,\" I tell him and glance fiercely at Kirilli. \"It\u0027s time you proved yourself worthy of rescue. Carry her.\" \"But I have a bad back,\" he protests. \"I never lift anything heavier than-\" \"Carry her,\" I repeat myself, \"or I\u0027ll cut your legs off, glue them to Sharmila and let her walk out of here on your feet.\" Kirilli gives a little cry of horror. He suspects I\u0027m bluffing, but he\u0027s uncertain. \"I am not that heavy,\" Sharmila chuckles. \"Especially without my legs.\" \"We\u0027re nearly there,\" I tell the stage magician. \"You won\u0027t have to carry her far.\" \"Very well,\" Kirilli snaps. \"But if I throw my back out of joint, I\u0027ll sue.\" He flashes me a feeble grin and picks up Sharmila. I help settle her on his back, then push through the zombies converging on us, lashing out with both my small fists, praying for the strength to stay on my feet long enough to guide us all to safety. I\u0027m almost fully drained. Only a sheer stubborn streak keeps me going. I refuse to fall this close to the end. It happened before, in the cave all those centuries ago. I almost made it out. I could see the exit as the rock ground shut around it. It was horrible to come up short with freedom in sight. I won\u0027t taste that defeat again. Deckchairs and unbolted fixtures slide down the deck. Some of the zombies topple and slide too. Extra obstacles for us to dodge. The end of the ship continues to rise out of the water. A few more minutes and the angle will be too steep to climb. We\u0027ll slip backwards to perish with the zombies when the ship\u0027s dragged under. We catch sight of the swimming pool. The window\u0027s still open and Kernel\u0027s in front of it. But he\u0027s struggling with a zombie. There are dozens around him and the window, separated from them by a circle of magic. But one has pierced his defences and is wrestling with him. \"Kernel!\" I cry. \"Hold on. We\u0027re almost with you. We-\" Kernel shouts something in response. He tries to tear himself away from the zombie, then reaches for its head to rip it loose-it\u0027s only attached by jagged strips of flesh to the neck. There\u0027s a flash of blinding light and we all cover our eyes, Kirilli dropping Sharmila out of necessity. When I open my eyes a few seconds later, it\u0027s like looking at a bright light through several layers of plastic. I blink furiously to clear my vision. When I can see properly, I look for Kernel. The circle where he was is still in place. The zombies around it are all momentarily sightless, stumbling into each other, rubbing their eyes. But the window is gone. And where it stood-where Kernel and the zombie were battling-is an ugly swill of tattered flesh, clumps of guts, fragments of bones and several pints of wasted human blood.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-s-shadow-the-demonata-7/page-21.html","bookId":2181,"book":{"id":2181,"title":"Death\u0027s Shadow (The Demonata #7)","description":"Storyline: Death\u0027s Shadow (The Demonata #7) The apocalypse came and the world burned.
