But I bite down hard on my fear and scuttle after Dervish, Meera bringing up the rear. As reluctant as I am to enter, I\u0027ll take a dark, tight space over gunfire and werewolves any day.\n Dervish reaches the window at the end of the tunnel. It\u0027s semi-circular, with thick stained glass. He can see out, but it would be hard for anybody outside to see in. He observes in silence. Ten seconds pass. Twenty. Thirty. I can still hear the howls of the werewolves and splintering wood. The door can\u0027t hold much longer. They might not be able to enter the protected study, but when they realise we\u0027re not there, they\u0027ll come hunting for us. What\u0027s Dervish waiting for?\n Finally he sighs and turns-there\u0027s just enough space. I start to ask a question, but he puts a finger to his lips and shakes his head. I nod bitterly. There must be people with guns outside, or more werewolves. Either way, we can\u0027t go via the window. We\u0027ll have to try sneaking through the house.\n We backtrack past the study, then follow the crawlway round to the right. A short distance later, Dervish removes a panel and slips through the hole in the ceiling beneath us. He helps me down, grabbing my legs and easing me to the floor. Some of his memories flow into me-mostly about Bill-E-but the contact is brief.\n We\u0027re in a short corridor on the second floor of the house, close to the hall of portraits, which is filled with paintings and photographs of dead family members, most of whom turned into werewolves. Soft growling sounds coming from that direction. Dervish listens for a moment, looks around uneasily, then starts towards the hall. Meera and I dutifully follow.\n The hall is a mess of shattered frames, ripped paintings and photos. In the middle of it all squats a werewolf. He\u0027s roughly tearing a large portrait to shreds, stuffing bits of canvas into his mouth, chewing and spitting the pieces out. He\u0027s urinated over some of the paintings, either marking his territory or showing undue disdain for the Grady clan.\n The werewolf doesn\u0027t spot us until we\u0027re almost upon him. Then Dervish steps on a piece of frame hidden beneath scraps of paper. It snaps and the werewolf\u0027s head shoots up. His growl deepens and his lips split into a vicious sneer. Using his powerful legs, he leaps at us, howling as he attacks. He slams into Dervish and drives him to the floor.\n No time to use my axe. I yelp and grab the werewolf\u0027s jaw, trying to keep his teeth from closing on Dervish\u0027s unprotected throat. Jumbled, fragmented memories shoot from the werewolf\u0027s fevered brain into mine. What I learn disturbs me, but I don\u0027t dwell on it-I have more urgent matters to deal with. The werewolf\u0027s teeth are only a couple of centimetres from Dervish\u0027s jugular vein.\n I prepare a spell to force shut the werewolf\u0027s mouth, but Meera\u0027s faster than me. She takes quick aim, then brains the werewolf with her mace. The werewolf\u0027s head snaps to the left. His eyelids flicker. Then he slumps over Dervish and it\u0027s simple enough to slide him off.\n Dervish is furious when he rises. \"I should have seen that one coming a mile away,\" he snarls, wiping blood from his left arm where the werewolf gouged him.\n \"You\u0027re getting old and slow,\" Meera taunts him. \"What now?\"\n \"The cellar,\" Dervish says.\n \"We\u0027re going to cage ourselves in and get drunk?\" she frowns.\n \"It connects with the secret cellar,\" Dervish says impatiently. \"That\u0027s a place of magic. We can seal the doors and keep our assailants out. Unless they-\"\n He\u0027s interrupted by howls from the floor above. The three werewolves have either broken through the door or heard the howl of the one we knocked out. They\u0027re coming. We leap over the unconscious animal and flee for the staircase.\n Racing down the stairs, the werewolves no more than a handful of seconds behind. If there are more on the ground floor, or snipers with a clear view, we\u0027ll be easy targets.\n But luck is with us. We hit the ground without encountering any enemies. The howls and screams of the werewolves pollute the air. It sounds like they\u0027re poised to drag us down at any moment, but we can\u0027t risk looking back to check.\n Dervish hits the light switches as he passes, turning them off, to hide us from the snipers. He hurries to the cellar door, barges through, waits for Meera and me to streak past, then slams it shut and locks it. A werewolf batters into it less than two seconds later. This door isn\u0027t as sturdy as the one in the study. It won\u0027t delay them long.\n We spill down the steps to the cellar, automatic lights flickering on as we hit the bottom. This is where Dervish stores his priceless wine collection. Rack after rack of vintage bottles. Behind one of the racks is a hidden exit and a tunnel leading to a second, secret, cellar.\n Dervish cuts through the maze of wine racks, angling for the exit, but we\u0027re not even halfway when the door above gives and the werewolves roar down the stairs. We won\u0027t make it. And even if we get to the rack ahead of them, the panels won\u0027t close in time. They\u0027ll be able to surge into the tunnel after us. Not much room for fighting in there.\n \"You go,\" I pant, laying aside my axe and turning to face the werewolves.\n \"Are you mad?\" Meera shouts.\n \"Go!\" I yell, grabbing two bottles from a rack. \"I\u0027ll follow.\"\n Meera starts to argue but Dervish grabs her and shoves her ahead of him. He nods at me to wish me luck, then flees.\n I face the onrushing werewolves. I have a plan. Sort of. Not a very good one, but if it works, it\u0027ll buy us some time. If it doesn\u0027t, the werewolves will soon be tucking into Bec burgers.\n The wine racks form narrow corridors. Wide enough for one person, but two\u0027s tight and three\u0027s a squeeze. When the werewolves see me alone, they go wild and rush forward, getting entangled with each other in the inadequate space. When the dominant male bucks off the others, I toss the bottles at him, then turn and run. I make a left at the end of the corridor, leading the werewolves away from Dervish and Meera-and the only way out.\n Running through the cellar. I\u0027ve managed to keep ahead of the werewolves. If they were human, with full control of their senses, it would be a simple matter for them to ensnare me. A pair could simply circle around and wait for me at the end of any of the narrow corridors. The third could chase me towards the others in about half a minute. Game over.\n But these beasts work by instinct. They can\u0027t think far ahead. When they have the scent of prey, they can only focus on the chase. So they plough along behind me, slipping and sliding in their haste. I grab bottles of wine as I run, lobbing them at the werewolves. They don\u0027t do much damage but every bit helps.\n I run into a dead end. I\u0027d been expecting it. Part of the plan. I stop half a metre from the wall, turn and wait. The werewolves gibber with delight when they see I\u0027m trapped. They inch forward, clawed fingers flexing, drool dripping from their fangs.\n I\u0027ve been working on the spell since I started running. There\u0027s not much more magic here than upstairs, but hopefully the thin traces will be enough. I wait until the lead werewolf is a metre away, then unleash the spell at the bottles of wine in the racks around me. \"Fly!\" I scream.\n The bottles shake in their holders. The werewolves pause warily. The cork of one bottle pops out. Wine sprays from the neck, showering the female. She cringes, then laughs hoarsely, sucks wine from the hairs on her arms and licks her lips.\n A few more corks pop. The werewolves are being showered with first-rate wine. They wipe it from their faces, scowling but unharmed, and nudge forward again. I start to think my plan has failed, then...\n Dozens of bottles shoot off the racks and slam into the werewolves. The monsters howl with pain and fall to the floor in protective huddles. Glass shatters over and around them, pounding their shoulders, backs and heads. Cuts open and bones break. One bottle smashes most of the fangs in the lesser male\u0027s mouth.\n I make my move, not waiting for the shower of glass to cease. I scurry up the wine rack to my left, using it as a makeshift ladder. I crouch on top, set my hands against the ceiling and strain with my feet, trying to topple the rack. If it was full of bottles, I couldn\u0027t budge it. But it\u0027s mostly empty and it rocks nicely beneath me. I sway it backwards and forwards a couple of times, then send it toppling over the werewolves, further confusing, enraging and delaying them.\n I leap to the neighbouring rack as the first goes over, then hop to the next and the next, like a frog. There\u0027s not much space between the tops of the racks and the ceiling. An adult couldn\u0027t manoeuvre up here, but there\u0027s just enough room for a wee Bec of a girl like me.\n The screams of the werewolves are almost deafening in the confines of the cellar. But to my ears, hopping ever further away from them, it\u0027s like music. The bottles and rack won\u0027t stall the werewolves for long, but I don\u0027t need much time.\n Seconds later I come to the exit. It\u0027s normally hidden behind what looks like an ordinary wine rack. Dervish has opened it and the two halves of the rack gape wide. I can see the secret corridor and Meera lurking within it. Leaping off the rack, I make a neat landing and snap to my feet like a gymnast finishing a complicated routine.\n \"Cute,\" Dervish grunts, then smiles and waves me through. I push past and he hurries after me. The mechanical rack slides shut behind us, cutting out the cries of the werewolves and sheltering us from the bloodthirsty beasts. We share a grin of relief, then hurry down the corridor to the safety of the second cellar.\n A minute later we arrive at a large, dark door. It has a gold ring handle. Dervish tugs it open and we slip through. It\u0027s dark inside.\n \"Give me a moment,\" Dervish says, moving ahead of us, leaving the door open for illumination. \"There are candles and I have matches. This will be the brightest room in the universe in a matter of-\"\n The door slams shut. A werewolf howls. Meera and I are knocked apart by something hard and hairy. Dervish cries out in alarm. There\u0027s the sound of a table being knocked over. Scuffling noises. The werewolf\u0027s teeth snap. Meera is yelling Dervish\u0027s name. I hear her scrabbling around, searching for the mace which she must have dropped when we were knocked apart.\n I\u0027m calm. There\u0027s magic in the air here. Old-time magic. Not exactly like it was when I first walked the Earth, but similar. I fill with power. The fingers on my left hand flex, then those on my right. Standing, I draw in more energy and ask for-no, demand light.\n A ball of bright flame bursts into life overhead. The werewolf screeches and covers its face with a hairy arm. Its eyes are more sensitive than ours-perfect for seeing in the dark. But that strength is now its weakness.\n As Dervish huffs and puffs, trying to wriggle out from beneath the werewolf, I wave a contemptuous hand at the beast. It flies clear of him and crashes into the wall. The werewolf whines and tries to rise. I start to unleash a word of magic designed to rip it into a hundred pieces. Then I recall what I learnt in the hall of portraits. Instead of killing it, I send the beast to sleep, drawing the shades of slumber across its eyes as simply as I\u0027d draw curtains across a window. As it falls, I flick a wrist at it and the werewolf slides sideways and out through an open door, the one it must have entered through before we arrived.\n Dervish sits up and looks at the door. \"We have to shut it,\" he groans, staggering to his feet. \"Block it off before...\"\n At a gesture from me, the door closes smoothly. Blue fire runs around the rim, sealing it shut. I do the same with the rim of the door we came through. \"Sorted,\" I grunt. \"Balor himself couldn\u0027t get through those now.\"\n Dervish and Meera gawp at me and I smile self-consciously. \"Well, I was a priestess.\"\n Dervish starts to chuckle. Meera giggles. Within seconds we\u0027re laughing like clowns. I\u0027ve seen this many times before. Near-death experiences often leave a person crying or laughing hysterically.\n \"I wish I could have seen you go to work on those werewolves,\" Meera crows. \"We could hear it, but we couldn\u0027t see.\"\n \"It\u0027s just a pity you couldn\u0027t do it some other way,\" Dervish sighs. \"Some of my finest bottles were stored back there.\"\n \"You can\u0027t be serious!\" Meera shouts.\n \"A Disciple can always be replaced,\" Dervish mutters, \"but a few of those bottles were the last of their vintage.\"\n My smile starts to fade, but then Dervish winks at me. \"Only kidding. You were great.\" He wipes sweat and blood from his forehead, then coughs. \"I\u0027m beat. Meera was right-I\u0027m getting old and slow. I need to sit down. I feel...\"\n Dervish\u0027s face blanches. His lips go tight and his eyes bulge. He staggers back a step, gasps for air, then collapses. Meera screams his name and rushes to his side.\n \"What is it?\" I cry, whirling around, testing the air for traces of a spell being cast against us.\n \"Dervish?\" Meera asks, holding his arms steady as he thrashes weakly on the floor.\n \"Who\u0027s doing this?\" I bellow. \"I can\u0027t sense anybody. I don\u0027t know what sort of a spell they\u0027re using.\"\n \"Quiet,\" Meera says. She tugs her cardigan off and slides it under Dervish\u0027s head. His face has turned as grey as his beard. His eyelids are closed. His chest is rising and falling roughly.\n \"But the spell! I must-\"\n \"There isn\u0027t any spell,\" Meera says softly, stroking the tufts of hair at the sides of Dervish\u0027s head. She\u0027s studying him with warm sadness, like a mother nursing a seriously ill baby.\n \"Then what is it?\" I stumble towards her, stopping short of Dervish\u0027s twitching feet. \"What\u0027s wrong with him?\"\n Meera looks up. There\u0027s fear in her eyes, but it isn\u0027t fear of demons, werewolves or magic. \"He\u0027s had a heart attack,\" she says. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-s-shadow-the-demonata-7/page-9.html","bookId":2181,"book":{"id":2181,"title":"Death\u0027s Shadow (The Demonata #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Death\u0027s Shadow (The Demonata #7) \n The apocalypse came and the world burned.
