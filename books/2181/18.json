There are no walls or ceiling, only a clear blue sky and glaring sun far overhead. I squint and cover my eyes with a hand. When my pupils adjust, I slowly lower my hand and stare around with awe.\\n\\n We\u0027re surrounded by water-we must be on a boat. Everywhere I look, an ocean stretches ahead of me, small waves lazily rippling by. I\u0027ve only seen the sea once before and that was from the safety of land. Finding myself stranded in the middle of it makes me feel sick. Even though the floor is steady, my legs seem to wobble beneath me and I have to fight to calm my stomach.\\n\\n \"Easy, Little One,\" Beranabus murmurs, touching my arm and smiling.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so vast,\" I whisper, eyes round.\\n\\n \"Aye, but it\u0027s only the sea. You\u0027ve nothing to fear.\"\\n\\n \"But the monsters...\" I catch myself. In my time we thought the sea was home to an array of terrors. Now I know that isn\u0027t so. I remind myself that I\u0027m not living in the fifth century any longer. Frowning at myself for overreacting, I order my legs to steady and my stomach to stop churning.\\n\\n Breathing more calmly, I pivot slowly and study the vessel on which we\u0027ve landed. We\u0027re on the deck of a massive ship, a luxury cruise liner, but its grandeurs have been spoilt by a recent, vicious attack. Deckchairs are strewn everywhere. We\u0027re close to a swimming pool-the water is red and there are bodies floating in it. A man lies spread-eagled on a diving board, blood dripping from his throat into the water. More corpses dot the deck and some are draped over deckchairs.\\n\\n There are carcasses everywhere. Freshly dead, with blood oozing from them. Men, women and children. Some are in crew uniforms, others in swim wear or casual clothes. Apart from the soft dripping noises of the blood, there\u0027s no sound, not even the chug of an engine. The boat is as dead as the butchered passengers and staff.\\n\\n As I gaze with horror at the carnage, the more experienced Sharmila checks a few of the bodies to ensure they\u0027re beyond help. \"Juni could not have killed all these people by herself,\" she says quietly.\\n\\n \"She could,\" Beranabus grunts, \"but I don\u0027t think she did. You can see different marks if you look closely. A group of demons had a party here.\"\\n\\n \"Where are they now?\" Dervish asks, fingers flexing angrily.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027d like to know.\" Beranabus walks to the diving board, steps on to it and pushes the body off into the water as if it was a rubbish bag-he can be as detached as a demon when he needs to be. The splash disturbs the silence. We wait edgily, but nothing reacts to the noise.\\n\\n \"Are you sure Dervish and Sharmila are safe here?\" I ask Kernel, trying to find something other than the corpses to focus on. \"There\u0027s magic in the air, but I\u0027m not sure it will hold.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s secure,\" he assures me. \"We wouldn\u0027t have brought them over if we had any doubts. We\u0027re surrounded by a bubble of magical energy. The entire ship\u0027s been encased.\"\\n\\n \"Like the town of Slawter,\" Dervish notes, then tugs anxiously at his beard. \"This bubble-it\u0027s pretty impenetrable?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Kernel says.\\n\\n \"So if the window to the oasis blinks out of existence, we\u0027re trapped.\"\\n\\n Kernel smiles. \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll keep it open. That\u0027s what I excel at.\"\\n\\n Beranabus returns from the diving board. \"They must have a lodestone on board. No demon could maintain a shield like this without a lodestone.\"\\n\\n Lodestones are stones of ancient-Old-power. Demons can use them to seal off an area and fill it with magic. That lets them operate as if they were in their own universe. They can use them to open tunnels as well, if the stone is especially powerful. But they need human help. They can\u0027t do it alone.\\n\\n Lodestones are rare. When the Old Creatures inhabited the Earth, they used the stones to help keep back the Demonata. But in their absence the demons learnt to turn the magic of the stones against the humans they were originally intended to protect. Beranabus scoured the world for lodestones centuries ago and destroyed as many as he could find, or sealed them off like the one in Carcery Vale. But some evaded him and remain hidden in various corners of the world. Every so often a mage or demon tracks one down and trouble ensues.\\n\\n \"Is Juni still here?\" Dervish asks Kernel.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I answer first. \"I sense her near the bottom of the ship.\"\\n\\n \"This feels like a trap,\" Sharmila mutters.\\n\\n \"Aye,\" Beranabus says. \"But you learn to live with traps when you\u0027re chasing demons.\" He looks around. \"Are there any others, Bec?\"\\n\\n I let my senses drift through the areas below deck. \"There\u0027s one demon with Juni. Not very powerful. If there are others, they\u0027re masking themselves.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a window open down there,\" Kernel says.\\n\\n \"Fairly ordinary. Only weaker demons can cross through it.\"\\n\\n \"Could there be armed humans?\" Dervish asks.\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" I mutter. \"Humans are harder to sense than mages or demons.\"\\n\\n \"We can handle a few soldiers,\" Beranabus barks. \"I\u0027ll turn their guns into eels-see how much damage they can do with them then!\"\\n\\n \"We should go back,\" Sharmila says. \"Juni has set this up to ensnare us.\"\\n\\n \"Why would she be expecting us?\" Dervish argues.\\n\\n \"Lord Loss may have reasoned that we would target Juni. Perhaps everything-the attacks on Dervish, Juni revealing herself on the roof of the hospital-was designed to lure Beranabus here. The demon master might be poised to cross and finish us off personally.\"\\n\\n \"Not through that window,\" Kernel insists.\\n\\n \"Then through another,\" she counters. \"We have never been able to explain why Lord Loss can cross when other masters cannot, or how he goes about it.\"\\n\\n Beranabus considers that, then sighs. \"You could be right, but we might never get a better shot at Juni. If she\u0027s not expecting us, it\u0027s the perfect time to strike. If she is and this is a trap, at least we can anticipate the worst. The magic in the air means she\u0027ll be dangerous, but it serves us as much as her. If Lord Loss doesn\u0027t turn up, we can match her. If he does cross, we\u0027ll make a swift getaway.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure of that?\" Sharmila scowls. \"If we have to open a new window...\"\\n\\n \"We won\u0027t,\" Beranabus says. \"Kernel will stay here and guard our escape route. You\u0027ll know if any other windows open, won\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Kernel says.\\n\\n \"Then keep this one alive and watch for signs of further activity. If you sense anything, summon us and we\u0027ll withdraw. Is everyone satisfied with that?\"\\n\\n He looks pointedly at Sharmila. She frowns then shrugs. Taking the lead, Beranabus picks his way across the bloody, corpse-strewn deck and the rest of us cautiously, nervously follow.\\n\\n My feet are soon sticky with blood, but I ignore my queasy feelings. This isn\u0027t the way the world should be, having to creep through pools of blood, past dozens of slaughtered humans. But when you find yourself in the middle of a living nightmare you have two choices. You can cower in a corner, eyes shut, praying for it to be over. Or you can get on with things and do your best to deal with the job in hand. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m particularly brave, but I like to think I\u0027ve always been practical.\\n\\n We undertake a circuit of the upper deck before venturing into the depths of the ship, making sure there aren\u0027t any surprises waiting for us up here if we have to make a quick getaway. We don\u0027t find any demons or soldiers in league with the Demonata. Just one corpse after another, slowly frying beneath the merciless sun.\\n\\n We\u0027re passing a row of lifeboats when I feel a twitch at the back of my eyes. It\u0027s the subtlest of sensations. I\u0027d ignore it any other time. But I\u0027m trying to be alert to the least hint of anything amiss, so I stop and focus. The twitch draws me to the third boat ahead of us. It hangs from hooks high above the deck.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Beranabus whispers. I feel magic build within him. He\u0027s converting the energy in the air into a force he can use.\\n\\n \"Somebody\u0027s there.\" I point to the lifeboat. \"A man. Hiding from us. He\u0027s using a masking spell.\"\\n\\n \"Get ready,\" Beranabus says to the others. He points a finger at the hooks. They snap and the boat drops abruptly, landing hard on the deck. The man inside it yelps and tumbles out as the boat keels over.\\n\\n Sharmila and Dervish step ahead of Beranabus, fingers crackling with pent-up magic. The man shrieks and wildly raises his hands, shouting, \"I surrender!\"\\n\\n \"Wait!\" Sharmila snaps, grabbing Dervish\u0027s arm. \"I know him.\"\\n\\n The man pauses when he hears Sharmila\u0027s voice. He stares at her shakily as if he doesn\u0027t believe his ears or eyes.\\n\\n \"Kirilli Kovacs,\" Sharmila says.\\n\\n \"I... I recognise you... I think,\" he croaks.\\n\\n \"We met several years ago. You were with Zahava Lever. She was your mentor. My name is Sharmila-\"\\n\\n \"-Mukherji,\" the man says, breaking into a big smile. \"Of course. Zavi spoke very highly of you. She said you were a great Disciple, one of the finest. I should have recognised you immediately. My apologies. It\u0027s been a hard few...\" He frowns. \"I was going to say days, but it\u0027s only been hours.\"\\n\\n \"This is one of your lot?\" Beranabus sniffs. We\u0027re all a bit mystified. The man is wearing a dark suit, but there are silver and gold stars stitched into the shoulders and down the sides. He sports a thin moustache and is wearing mascara. He looks like a stage magician, not a Disciple.\\n\\n \"This is my cover,\" he explains sheepishly. \"I ran into fiscal complications...\" He clears his throat. \"Actually I gambled away my cash and my credit card was taken from me by a woman in... but that\u0027s another story. I had to get on the ship. I could have used magic but it was easier to get a job. So I did, as Kirilli the Konjuror. I\u0027ve used this disguise before. It\u0027s always been effective. I can put on a first-rate stage show when I have to.\"\\n\\n \"Your standards are slipping,\" Beranabus says to Sharmila. \"I might have to review the recruiting policy of the Disciples.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m of a first-rate pedigree, sir,\" Kirilli snaps. \"Even the best of us can fall prey to the occasional vice.\" He tugs the arms of his jacket straight and glares.\\n\\n \"Zahava said Kirilli was an excellent spy,\" Sharmila says. \"He is very adept at trailing people and hiding from them. The fact that he survived the massacre here is proof of that. The Disciples need spies as much as they need warriors.\"\\n\\n \"Precisely,\" Kirilli huffs. \"There\u0027s a man for every job, as my dear departed father used to say.\"\\n\\n \"I bet he worked in sewerage,\" Dervish says drily.\\n\\n Kirilli flushes, but ignores the jibe. \"By the way,\" he says stiffly, \"I didn\u0027t catch your names.\"\\n\\n Beranabus shrugs. \"This is Dervish Grady. That\u0027s Bec. I\u0027m Beranabus.\"\\n\\n Kirilli\u0027s jaw drops and he loses his composure completely.\\n\\n Beranabus winks at me. \"I have that effect on a lot of my idolising Disciples.\"\\n\\n \"Only until we get to know you,\" Sharmila mutters, then addresses Kirilli again. \"Can you tell us what happened? Swiftly, please-we do not have much time.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s really Beranabus?\" Kirilli says, wide-eyed. \"I thought he\u0027d look more like Merlin or Gandalf.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll turn you into a hobbit if you don\u0027t start talking,\" Dervish growls.\\n\\n Kirilli blanches, then scowls. \"I was tracking a pair of rogue mages,\" he says, adjusting his bow-tie-I spot a playing card up his sleeve. \"They were planning to open a window.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you stop them?\" Dervish asks.\\n\\n \"They were working for somebody else, taking orders from a superior. I wanted to expose their partner. I felt that was more important than stopping the crossing, although I hoped to do that as well.\"\\n\\n \"No prizes for guessing who their boss was,\" Dervish grimaces. \"Ugly cow, disfigured, covered in pus and blood?\"\\n\\n Kirilli nods and shivers. \"They were in regular contact, but I couldn\u0027t get a fix on who they were talking to. From what I overheard, it sounded like there were no imminent plans to open the window. They made it sound like they\u0027d be on the boat for months, waiting for an order to act.\\n\\n \"They either knew I was eavesdropping and said that to fool me, or there was a change of plan. Either way, they opened the window earlier today. About twenty demons spat through and set to work on the crew and guests. I managed to shield myself. That\u0027s all I could do. There was no point fighting them-I wouldn\u0027t have stood a chance.\" He looks at us appealingly.\\n\\n \"You did all you could,\" Sharmila says kindly. \"You are a spy, not a warrior. Besides, Disciples never fight when the odds are stacked against them. You have no reason to feel guilty.\"\\n\\n Gratitude sweeps across Kirilli\u0027s face. \"I expected the window to close after a few minutes but it stayed open and there was more magic in the air than I\u0027ve ever experienced. The demons went on torturing and slaughtering. They took most of the people below deck. Maybe the sun bothered them and they wanted to do their work in the shade.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Beranabus grunts. \"Lodestones need blood. They were feeding it.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s a lodestone?\" Kirilli asks but Beranabus waves at him to continue. \"Balint and Zsolt- the mages-remained up top. They did their share of killing but nothing to compare with the demons. Not long before you lot arrived that woman... that thing crawled up from below.\" He shudders. \"I wasn\u0027t sure if she was human or Demonata. I\u0027m still not certain.\"\\n\\n \"I doubt if she knows herself anymore,\" Beranabus says softly.\\n\\n \"She barked orders at the demons and they killed the last few survivors,\" Kirilli goes on. \"Then they retreated through the window and the woman said a spell to close it. Balint and Zsolt were grinning, mightily pleased with themselves, but she turned on them. Melted them into twin pools of bloody goo. Laughed as they screamed for mercy. Told them they were fools to trust the word of a monster. She lay down and wallowed in their juices when they were dead, then went below deck. That\u0027s when I climbed into the lifeboat.\"\\n\\n \"Interesting,\" Beranabus murmurs. Then he winks at Sharmila. \"This definitely stinks of a trap.\"\\n\\n \"So we will leave?\" Sharmila asks eagerly.\\n\\n Beranabus chuckles. \"I\u0027ve walked into more traps over the centuries than I can remember. The Demonata and their familiars think they\u0027re masters of cunning but they haven\u0027t got the better of me yet. Let Juni and Lord Loss spring their surprise. I\u0027ll blast a hole in it so big, you could sail this ship through.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" Dervish asks uneasily. \"Juni was your apprentice. She knows all about you. Maybe you have a weak spot which she plans to exploit.\"\\n\\n Beranabus shrugs. \"I love a challenge.\"\\n\\n \"I really do not think we should-\" Sharmila begins.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve no choice,\" Beranabus snaps. \"She\u0027s our only link to the Shadow. It\u0027s a gamble, but this is a time for gambling. I don\u0027t think you understand the stakes. This is the end game. We don\u0027t have the luxury of caution. If we don\u0027t risk all and find out who the Shadow is and what its plans are, the world will fall.\" He waves at the corpses around us. \"A world of this, Sharmila. Is that what you want?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" she mutters.\\n\\n \"Then trust me. We\u0027re precariously balanced and I might be testing one trap too many, but we can\u0027t play safe. It\u0027s all or nothing now.\"\\n\\n \"You truly believe matters are that advanced?\" Sharmila asks.\\n\\n \"Aye.\" Beranabus\u0027s eyes glitter. \"The Disciples have exercised caution over the years because there have always been other battles to fight. But this could be the final battle. Ever. Better to risk all on a desperate gamble than play it safe and hand victory to the Shadow. Aye?\"\\n\\n Sharmila hesitates, then smiles shakily. \"Aye. If we fail, at least I will have the pleasure of saying, \u0027I told you so\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the spirit,\" Beranabus booms and heads for the nearest door. Without any sign of fear he leads us down into the bowels of the ship in search of the vile viper, Juni Swan. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-s-shadow-the-demonata-7/page-18.html","bookId":2181,"book":{"id":2181,"title":"Death\u0027s Shadow (The Demonata #7)","description":"Storyline: Death\u0027s Shadow (The Demonata #7) \\n The apocalypse came and the world burned.
