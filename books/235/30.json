And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Come here to me with the ephod. And Abiathar took the ephod to David. \\n\\n 30:8 [hgb] 大 卫 求 问 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 追 赶 敌 军 ， 追 得 上 追 不 上 呢 ？ 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 可 以 追 ， 必 追 得 上 ， 都 救 得 回 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all. \\n\\n [bbe] Then David, questioning the Lord, said, Am I to go after this band? will I be able to overtake them? And in answer he said, Go after them, for you will certainly overtake them, and get back everything. \\n\\n 30:9 [hgb] 于 是 ， 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 六 百 人 来 到 比 梭 溪 。 有 不 能 前 去 的 就 留 在 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed. \\n\\n [bbe] So David went, and his six hundred men went with him, and they came to the stream Besor. \\n\\n 30:10 [hgb] 大 卫 却 带 着 四 百 人 往 前 追 赶 ， 有 二 百 人 疲 乏 ， 不 能 过 比 梭 溪 ， 所 以 留 在 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor. \\n\\n [bbe] And David, with four hundred men, went on: but two hundred of them were overcome with weariness, and not able to go across the stream. \\n\\n 30:11 [hgb] 这 四 百 人 在 田 野 遇 见 一 个 埃 及 人 ， 就 带 他 到 大 卫 面 前 ， 给 他 饼 吃 ， 给 他 水 喝 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water; \\n\\n [bbe] And in the fields they saw an Egyptian whom they took to David, and they gave him bread, and he had a meal, and they gave him water for drink; \\n\\n 30:12 [hgb] 又 给 他 一 块 无 花 果 饼 ， 两 个 葡 萄 饼 。 他 吃 了 ， 就 精 神 复 原 。 因 为 他 三 日 三 夜 没 有 吃 饼 ， 没 有 喝 水 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights. \\n\\n [bbe] And they gave him part of a cake of figs and some dry grapes; and after the food, his spirit came back to him, for he had had no food or drink for three days and nights. \\n\\n 30:13 [hgb] 大 卫 问 他 说 ， 你 是 属 谁 的 。 你 是 哪 里 的 人 。 他 回 答 说 ， 我 是 埃 及 的 少 年 人 ， 是 亚 玛 力 人 的 奴 仆 。 因 我 三 日 前 患 病 ， 我 主 人 就 把 我 撇 弃 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to him, Whose man are you and where do you come from? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master went on without me because three days back I became ill. \\n\\n 30:14 [hgb] 我 们 侵 夺 了 基 利 提 的 南 方 和 属 犹 大 的 地 ， 并 迦 勒 地 的 南 方 ， 又 用 火 烧 了 洗 革 拉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire. \\n\\n [bbe] We made an attack on the south part of the country of the Cherethites, and on the land which is Judah\u0027s, and on the south of Caleb; and we put Ziklag on fire. \\n\\n 30:15 [hgb] 大 卫 问 他 说 ， 你 肯 领 我 们 到 敌 军 那 里 不 肯 。 他 回 答 说 ， 你 要 向 我 指 着 神 起 誓 ， 不 杀 我 ， 也 不 将 我 交 在 我 主 人 手 里 ， 我 就 领 你 上 到 敌 军 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company. \\n\\n [bbe] And David said to him, Will you take me down to this band? And he said, If you give me your oath that you will not put me to death or give me up to my master, I will take you to them. \\n\\n 30:16 [hgb] 那 人 领 大 卫 下 去 ， 见 他 们 散 在 地 上 ， 吃 喝 跳 舞 ， 因 为 从 非 利 士 地 和 犹 大 地 所 掳 来 的 财 物 甚 多 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. \\n\\n [bbe] And when he had taken him down, they saw them all, seated about on all sides, feasting and drinking among all the mass of goods which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah. \\n\\n 30:17 [hgb] 大 卫 从 黎 明 直 到 次 日 晚 上 ， 击 杀 他 们 ， 除 了 四 百 骑 骆 驼 的 少 年 人 之 外 ， 没 有 一 个 逃 脱 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled. \\n\\n [bbe] And David went on fighting them from evening till the evening of the day after; and not one of them got away but only four hundred young men who went in flight on camels. \\n\\n 30:18 [hgb] 亚 玛 力 人 所 掳 去 的 财 物 ， 大 卫 全 都 夺 回 ， 并 救 回 他 的 两 个 妻 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives. \\n\\n [bbe] And David got back everything the Amalekites had taken; and he got back his two wives. \\n\\n 30:19 [hgb] 凡 亚 玛 力 人 所 掳 去 的 ， 无 论 大 小 ， 儿 女 ， 财 物 ， 大 卫 都 夺 回 来 ， 没 有 失 落 一 个 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all. \\n\\n [bbe] There was no loss of anything, small or great, sons or daughters or goods or anything which they had taken away: David got it all back. \\n\\n 30:20 [hgb] 大 卫 所 夺 来 的 牛 群 羊 群 ， 跟 随 他 的 人 赶 在 原 有 的 群 畜 前 边 ， 说 ， 这 是 大 卫 的 掠 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David\u0027s spoil. \\n\\n [bbe] And they took all the flocks and herds, and driving them in front of him, said, These are David\u0027s. \\n\\n 30:21 [hgb] 大 卫 到 了 那 疲 乏 不 能 跟 随 ， 留 在 比 梭 溪 的 二 百 人 那 里 。 他 们 出 来 迎 接 大 卫 并 跟 随 的 人 。 大 卫 前 来 问 他 们 安 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them. \\n\\n [bbe] And David came to the two hundred men, who because of weariness had not gone with him, but were waiting at the stream Besor: and they went out, meeting David and the people who were with him; and when they came near them, they said, How are you? \\n\\n 30:22 [hgb] 跟 随 大 卫 人 中 的 恶 人 和 匪 类 说 ， 这 些 人 既 然 没 有 和 我 们 同 去 ， 我 们 所 夺 的 财 物 就 不 分 给 他 们 ， 只 将 他 们 各 人 的 妻 子 儿 女 给 他 们 ， 使 他 们 带 去 就 是 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the bad and good-for-nothing men among those who went with David said, Because they did not go with us, we will give them nothing of the goods which we have got back, but only to every man his wife and children, so that he may take them and go. \\n\\n 30:23 [hgb] 大 卫 说 ， 弟 兄 们 ， 耶 和 华 所 赐 给 我 们 的 ， 不 可 不 分 给 他 们 。 因 为 他 保 佑 我 们 ， 将 那 攻 击 我 们 的 敌 军 交 在 我 们 手 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand. \\n\\n [bbe] Then David said, You are not to do this, my brothers, after what the Lord has given us, who has kept us safe and given up the band which came against us into our hands. \\n\\n 30:24 [hgb] 这 事 谁 肯 依 从 你 们 呢 ？ 上 阵 的 得 多 少 ， 看 守 器 具 的 也 得 多 少 。 应 当 大 家 平 分 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike. \\n\\n [bbe] Who is going to give any attention to you in this question? for an equal part will be given to him who went to the fight and to him who was waiting by the goods: they are all to have the same. \\n\\n 30:25 [hgb] 大 卫 定 此 为 以 色 列 的 律 例 典 章 ， 从 那 日 直 到 今 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day. \\n\\n [bbe] And so he made it a rule and an order for Israel from that day till now. \\n\\n 30:26 [hgb] 大 卫 到 了 洗 革 拉 ， 从 掠 物 中 取 些 送 给 他 朋 友 犹 大 的 长 老 ， 说 ， 这 是 从 耶 和 华 仇 敌 那 里 夺 来 的 ， 送 你 们 为 礼 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD; \\n\\n [bbe] And when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the goods to the responsible men of Judah, and to his friends, saying, Here is an offering for you from the goods of those who were fighting against the Lord; \\n\\n 30:27 [hgb] 他 送 礼 物 给 住 伯 特 利 的 ， 南 地 拉 末 的 ， 雅 提 珥 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir, \\n\\n [bbe] He sent to those who were in Beth-el, and in Ramah of the South, and in Jattir; \\n\\n 30:28 [hgb] 住 亚 罗 珥 的 ， 息 末 的 ， 以 实 提 莫 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa, \\n\\n [bbe] And to those in Arara and Eshtemoa \\n\\n 30:29 [hgb] 住 拉 哈 勒 的 ， 耶 拉 篾 各 城 的 ， 基 尼 各 城 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites, \\n\\n [bbe] and Carmel and in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, and in the towns of the Kenites; \\n\\n 30:30 [hgb] 住 何 珥 玛 的 ， 歌 拉 珊 的 ， 亚 挞 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach, \\n\\n [bbe] And to those who were in Hormah and in Bor-ashan and in Athach; \\n\\n 30:31 [hgb] 住 希 伯 仑 的 ， 并 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 素 来 所 到 之 处 的 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt. \\n\\n [bbe] And in Hebron, and to all the places where David and his men had been living. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/581.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
