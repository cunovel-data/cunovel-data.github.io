{"id":7211,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"9:1 [hgb] 有 一 个 便 雅 悯 人 ， 名 叫 基 士 ， 是 便 雅 悯 人 亚 斐 亚 的 玄 孙 ， 比 歌 拉 的 曾 孙 ， 洗 罗 的 孙 子 ， 亚 别 的 儿 子 ， 是 个 大 能 的 勇 士 （ 或 作 大 财 主 ） 。 \n [kjv] Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. \n [bbe] Now there was a man of Benjamin named Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man of wealth. \n 9:2 [hgb] 他 有 一 个 儿 子 ， 名 叫 扫 罗 ， 又 健 壮 ， 又 俊 美 ， 在 以 色 列 人 中 没 有 一 个 能 比 他 的 。 身 体 比 众 民 高 过 一 头 。 \n [kjv] And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. \n [bbe] He had a son named Saul, a specially good-looking young man; there was no one better-looking among the children of Israel: he was taller by a head than any other of the people. \n 9:3 [hgb] 扫 罗 的 父 亲 基 士 丢 了 几 头 驴 ， 他 就 吩 咐 儿 子 扫 罗 说 ， 你 带 一 个 仆 人 去 寻 找 驴 。 \n [kjv] And the asses of Kish Saul\u0027s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. \n [bbe] Now the asses of Saul\u0027s father Kish had gone wandering away. And Kish said to his son Saul, Take one of the servants with you, and get up and go in search of the asses. \n 9:4 [hgb] 扫 罗 就 走 过 以 法 莲 山 地 ， 又 过 沙 利 沙 地 ， 都 没 有 找 着 。 又 过 沙 琳 地 ， 驴 也 不 在 那 里 。 又 过 便 雅 悯 地 ， 还 没 有 找 着 。 \n [kjv] And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not. \n [bbe] So they went through the hill-country of Ephraim and through the land of Shalishah, but they saw no sign of them: then they went through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there: and they went through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not come across them. \n 9:5 [hgb] 到 了 苏 弗 地 ， 扫 罗 对 跟 随 他 的 仆 人 说 ， 我 们 不 如 回 去 ， 恐 怕 我 父 亲 不 为 驴 挂 心 ， 反 为 我 们 担 忧 。 \n [kjv] And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us. \n [bbe] And when they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, Come, let us go back, or my father may give up caring about the asses and be troubled about us. \n 9:6 [hgb] 仆 人 说 ， 这 城 里 有 一 位 神 人 ， 是 众 人 所 尊 重 的 ， 凡 他 所 说 的 全 都 应 验 。 我 们 不 如 往 他 那 里 去 ， 或 者 他 能 将 我 们 当 走 的 路 指 示 我 们 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. \n [bbe] But the servant said to him, See now, in this town there is a man of God, who is highly honoured, and everything he says comes true: let us go there now; it may be that he will give us directions about our journey. \n 9:7 [hgb] 扫 罗 对 仆 人 说 ， 我 们 若 去 ， 有 什 么 可 以 送 那 人 呢 ？ 我 们 囊 中 的 食 物 都 吃 尽 了 ， 也 没 有 礼 物 可 以 送 那 神 人 ， 我 们 还 有 什 么 没 有 。 \n [kjv] Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? \n [bbe] Then Saul said to his servant, But if we go, what are we to take the man? all our bread is gone, and we have no offering to take to the man of God: what are we to do? \n 9:8 [hgb] 仆 人 回 答 扫 罗 说 ， 我 手 里 有 银 子 一 舍 客 勒 的 四 分 之 一 ， 可 以 送 那 神 人 ， 请 他 指 示 我 们 当 走 的 路 。 \n [kjv] And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. \n [bbe] But the servant said in answer, I have here a fourth part of a shekel of silver: I will give that to the man of God, and he will give us directions about our way. \n 9:9 [hgb] （ 从 前 以 色 列 中 ， 若 有 人 去 问 神 ， 就 说 ， 我 们 问 先 见 去 吧 。 现 在 称 为 先 知 的 ， 从 前 称 为 先 见 。 ） \n [kjv] (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) \n [bbe] (In the past in Israel, when a man went to get directions from God, he said, Come let us go to the Seer, for he who now is named Prophet was in those days given the name of Seer.) \n 9:10 [hgb] 扫 罗 对 仆 人 说 ， 你 说 的 是 ， 我 们 可 以 去 。 于 是 他 们 往 神 人 所 住 的 城 里 去 了 。 \n [kjv] Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was. \n [bbe] Then Saul said to his servant, You have said well; come, let us go. So they went to the town where the man of God was. \n 9:11 [hgb] 他 们 上 坡 要 进 城 ， 就 遇 见 几 个 少 年 女 子 出 来 打 水 ， 问 她 们 说 ， 先 见 在 这 里 没 有 。 \n [kjv] And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? \n [bbe] And when they were on the way up to the town, they saw some young girls going out to get water and said to them, Is the seer here? \n 9:12 [hgb] 女 子 回 答 说 ， 在 这 里 ， 他 在 你 们 前 面 。 快 去 吧 。 他 今 日 正 到 城 里 ， 因 为 今 日 百 姓 要 在 丘 坛 献 祭 。 \n [kjv] And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: \n [bbe] And they said, He is; in fact he is before you: go quickly now, for he has come into the town today, for the people are making an offering in the high place today: \n 9:13 [hgb] 在 他 还 没 有 上 丘 坛 吃 祭 物 之 先 ， 你 们 一 进 城 必 遇 见 他 。 因 他 未 到 ， 百 姓 不 能 吃 ， 必 等 他 先 祝 祭 ， 然 后 请 的 客 才 吃 。 现 在 你 们 上 去 ， 这 时 候 必 遇 见 他 。 \n [kjv] As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him. \n [bbe] When you come into the town you will see him straight away, before he goes up to the high place for the feast: the people are waiting for his blessing before starting the feast, and after that the guests will take part in it. So go up now and you will see him. \n 9:14 [hgb] 二 人 就 上 去 。 将 进 城 的 时 候 ， 撒 母 耳 正 迎 着 他 们 来 ， 要 上 丘 坛 去 。 \n [kjv] And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place. \n [bbe] So they went up to the town, and when they came inside the town, Samuel came face to face with them on his way to the high place. \n 9:15 [hgb] 扫 罗 未 到 的 前 一 日 ， 耶 和 华 已 经 指 示 撒 母 耳 说 ， \n [kjv] Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, \n [bbe] Now the day before Saul came, the word of God had come to Samuel, saying, \n 9:16 [hgb] 明 日 这 时 候 ， 我 必 使 一 个 人 从 便 雅 悯 地 到 你 这 里 来 ， 你 要 膏 他 作 我 民 以 色 列 的 君 。 他 必 救 我 民 脱 离 非 利 士 人 的 手 。 因 我 民 的 哀 声 上 达 于 我 ， 我 就 眷 顾 他 们 。 \n [kjv] To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. \n [bbe] Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and on him you are to put the holy oil, making him ruler over my people Israel, and he will make my people safe from the hands of the Philistines: for I have seen the sorrow of my people, whose cry has come up to me. \n 9:17 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 看 见 扫 罗 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 对 他 说 ， 看 哪 ， 这 人 就 是 我 对 你 所 说 的 ， 他 必 治 理 我 的 民 。 \n [kjv] And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people. \n [bbe] And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him, This is the man of whom I gave you word! he it is who is to have authority over my people. \n 9:18 [hgb] 扫 罗 在 城 门 里 走 到 撒 母 耳 跟 前 ， 说 ， 请 告 诉 我 ， 先 见 的 寓 所 在 哪 里 。 \n [kjv] Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer\u0027s house is. \n [bbe] Then Saul came up to Samuel in the doorway of the town and said, Give me directions, if you will be so good, to the house of the seer. \n 9:19 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 回 答 说 ， 我 就 是 先 见 。 你 在 我 前 面 上 丘 坛 去 ， 因 为 你 们 今 日 必 与 我 同 席 。 明 日 早 晨 我 送 你 去 ， 将 你 心 里 的 事 都 告 诉 你 。 \n [kjv] And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart. \n [bbe] Then Samuel said to Saul, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place and take food with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, after opening to you all the secrets of your heart. \n 9:20 [hgb] 至 于 你 前 三 日 所 丢 的 那 几 头 驴 ， 你 心 里 不 必 挂 念 ， 已 经 找 着 了 。 以 色 列 众 人 所 仰 慕 的 是 谁 呢 ？ 不 是 仰 慕 你 和 你 父 的 全 家 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father\u0027s house? \n [bbe] As for your asses which have been wandering for three days, give no thought to them, for they have come back. And for whom are all the desired things in Israel? are they not for you and your father\u0027s family? \n 9:21 [hgb] 扫 罗 说 ， 我 不 是 以 色 列 支 派 中 至 小 的 便 雅 悯 人 吗 ？ 我 家 不 是 便 雅 悯 支 派 中 至 小 的 家 吗 ？ 你 为 何 对 我 说 这 样 的 话 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me? \n [bbe] And Saul said, Am I not a man of Benjamin, the smallest of all the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of the families of Benjamin? why then do you say these words to me? \n 9:22 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 领 扫 罗 和 他 仆 人 进 了 客 堂 ， 使 他 们 在 请 来 的 客 中 坐 首 位 。 客 约 有 三 十 个 人 。 \n [kjv] And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons. \n [bbe] Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into the guest room, and made them take the chief place among all the guests who were there, about thirty persons. \n 9:23 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 对 厨 役 说 ， 我 交 给 你 收 存 的 那 一 分 祭 肉 现 在 可 以 拿 来 。 \n [kjv] And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee. \n [bbe] And Samuel said to the cook, Give me that part which I gave you orders to keep by you. \n 9:24 [hgb] 厨 役 就 把 收 存 的 腿 拿 来 ， 摆 在 扫 罗 面 前 ， 撒 母 耳 说 ， 这 是 所 留 下 的 ， 放 在 你 面 前 。 吃 吧 。 因 我 请 百 姓 的 时 候 ， 特 意 为 你 存 留 这 肉 到 此 时 。 当 日 ， 扫 罗 就 与 撒 母 耳 同 席 。 \n [kjv] And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. \n [bbe] And the cook took up the leg with the fat tail on it, and put it before Saul. And Samuel said, This is the part which has been kept for you: take it as your part of the feast; because it has been kept for you till the right time came and till the guests were present. So that day Saul took food with Samuel. \n 9:25 [hgb] 众 人 从 丘 坛 下 来 进 城 ， 撒 母 耳 和 扫 罗 在 房 顶 上 说 话 。 \n [kjv] And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house. \n [bbe] And when they had come down from the high place into the town, where a bed was made ready for Saul, he went to rest. \n 9:26 [hgb] 次 日 清 早 起 来 ， 黎 明 的 时 候 ， 扫 罗 在 房 顶 上 。 撒 母 耳 呼 叫 他 说 ， 起 来 吧 ， 我 好 送 你 回 去 。 扫 罗 就 起 来 ， 和 撒 母 耳 一 同 出 去 。 \n [kjv] And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. \n [bbe] And about dawn Samuel said to Saul on the roof, Get up so that I may send you away. So Saul got up, and he and Samuel went out together. \n 9:27 [hgb] 二 人 下 到 城 角 ， 撒 母 耳 对 扫 罗 说 ， 要 吩 咐 仆 人 先 走 （ 仆 人 就 先 走 了 ） 。 你 且 站 在 这 里 ， 等 我 将 神 的 话 传 与 你 听 。 \n [kjv] And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God. \n [bbe] And on their way down to the end of the town, Samuel said to Saul, Give your servant orders to go on in front of us, (so he went on,) but you keep here, so that I may give you the word of God. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/560.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
