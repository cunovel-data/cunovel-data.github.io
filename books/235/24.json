{"id":7226,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"24:1 [hgb] 扫 罗 追 赶 非 利 士 人 回 来 ， 有 人 告 诉 他 说 ， 大 卫 在 隐 基 底 的 旷 野 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi. [bbe] Now when Saul came back from fighting the Philistines, news was given him that David was in the waste land of En-gedi. 24:2 [hgb] 扫 罗 就 从 以 色 列 人 中 挑 选 三 千 精 兵 ， 率 领 他 们 往 野 羊 的 磐 石 去 ， 寻 索 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 。 [kjv] Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. [bbe] Then Saul took three thousand of the best men out of all Israel, and went in search of David and his men on the rocks of the mountain goats. 24:3 [hgb] 到 了 路 旁 的 羊 圈 ， 在 那 里 有 洞 ， 扫 罗 进 去 大 解 。 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 正 藏 在 洞 里 的 深 处 。 [kjv] And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave. [bbe] And on the way he came to a place where sheep were kept, where there was a hollow in the rock; and Saul went in for a private purpose. Now David and his men were in the deepest part of the hollow. 24:4 [hgb] 跟 随 的 人 对 大 卫 说 ， 耶 和 华 曾 应 许 你 说 ， 我 要 将 你 的 仇 敌 交 在 你 手 里 ， 你 可 以 任 意 待 他 。 如 今 时 候 到 了 。 大 卫 就 起 来 ， 悄 悄 地 割 下 扫 罗 外 袍 的 衣 襟 。 [kjv] And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul\u0027s robe privily. [bbe] And David\u0027s men said to him, Now is the time when the Lord says to you, I will give up your hater into your hands to do with him whatever seems good to you. Then David, getting up, took the skirt of Saul\u0027s robe in his hand, cutting off the end of it without his knowledge. 24:5 [hgb] 随 后 大 卫 心 中 自 责 ， 因 为 割 下 扫 罗 的 衣 襟 。 [kjv] And it came to pass afterward, that David\u0027s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul\u0027s skirt. [bbe] And later, David was full of regret for cutting off Saul\u0027s skirt. 24:6 [hgb] 对 跟 随 他 的 人 说 ， 我 的 主 乃 是 耶 和 华 的 受 膏 者 ， 我 在 耶 和 华 面 前 万 不 敢 伸 手 害 他 ， 因 他 是 耶 和 华 的 受 膏 者 。 [kjv] And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD\u0027s anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD. [bbe] And David said to his men, Before the Lord, never let it be said that my hand was lifted up against my lord, the man of the Lord\u0027s selection, for the Lord\u0027s holy oil has been put on him. 24:7 [hgb] 大 卫 用 这 话 拦 住 跟 随 他 的 人 ， 不 容 他 们 起 来 害 扫 罗 。 扫 罗 起 来 ， 从 洞 里 出 去 行 路 。 [kjv] So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way. [bbe] So with these words David kept his servants back, and did not let them make an attack on Saul. And Saul got up and went on his way. 24:8 [hgb] 随 后 大 卫 也 起 来 ， 从 洞 里 出 去 ， 呼 叫 扫 罗 说 ， 我 主 ， 我 王 。 扫 罗 回 头 观 看 ， 大 卫 就 屈 身 ， 脸 伏 于 地 下 拜 。 [kjv] David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself. [bbe] And after that David came out of the hollow rock, and crying after Saul said, My lord the king. And when Saul gave a look back, David went down on his face and gave him honour. 24:9 [hgb] 大 卫 对 扫 罗 说 ， 你 为 何 听 信 人 的 谗 言 ， 说 大 卫 想 要 害 你 呢 ？ [kjv] And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men\u0027s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? [bbe] And David said to Saul, Why do you give any attention to those who say that it is my desire to do you wrong? 24:10 [hgb] 今 日 你 亲 眼 看 见 在 洞 中 ， 耶 和 华 将 你 交 在 我 手 里 。 有 人 叫 我 杀 你 ， 我 却 爱 惜 你 ， 说 ， 我 不 敢 伸 手 害 我 的 主 ， 因 为 他 是 耶 和 华 的 受 膏 者 。 [kjv] Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD\u0027s anointed. [bbe] Look! you have seen today how the Lord gave you up into my hands even now in the hollow of the rocks: and some would have had me put you to death, but I had pity on you: for I said, Never will my hand be lifted up against my lord, who has been marked with the holy oil. 24:11 [hgb] 我 父 阿 ， 看 看 你 外 袍 的 衣 襟 在 我 手 中 。 我 割 下 你 的 衣 襟 ， 没 有 杀 你 。 你 由 此 可 以 知 道 我 没 有 恶 意 叛 逆 你 。 你 虽 然 猎 取 我 的 命 ， 我 却 没 有 得 罪 你 。 [kjv] Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it. [bbe] And see, my father, see the skirt of your robe in my hand: for the fact that I took off the skirt of your robe and did not put you to death is witness that I have no evil purpose, and I have done you no wrong, though you are waiting for my life to take it. 24:12 [hgb] 愿 耶 和 华 在 你 我 中 间 判 断 是 非 ， 在 你 身 上 为 我 伸 冤 ， 我 却 不 亲 手 加 害 于 你 。 [kjv] The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. [bbe] May the Lord be judge between me and you, and may the Lord give me my rights against you, but my hand will never be lifted up against you. 24:13 [hgb] 古 人 有 句 俗 语 说 ， 恶 事 出 于 恶 人 。 我 却 不 亲 手 加 害 于 你 。 [kjv] As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. [bbe] There is an old saying, From the evil-doer comes evil: but my hand will never be lifted up against you. 24:14 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 出 来 要 寻 找 谁 呢 ？ 追 赶 谁 呢 ？ 不 过 追 赶 一 条 死 狗 ， 一 个 虼 蚤 就 是 了 。 [kjv] After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. [bbe] After whom has the king of Israel come out? for whom are you searching? for a dead dog, an insect. 24:15 [hgb] 愿 耶 和 华 在 你 我 中 间 施 行 审 判 ， 断 定 是 非 ， 并 且 鉴 察 ， 为 我 伸 冤 ， 救 我 脱 离 你 的 手 。 [kjv] The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand. [bbe] So let the Lord be judge, and give a decision between me and you, and see and give support to my cause, and keep me from falling into your hands. 24:16 [hgb] 大 卫 向 扫 罗 说 完 这 话 ， 扫 罗 说 ， 我 儿 大 卫 ， 这 是 你 的 声 音 吗 ？ 就 放 声 大 哭 ， [kjv] And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. [bbe] Now when David had said these words to Saul, Saul said, Is this your voice, David, my son? And Saul was overcome with weeping. 24:17 [hgb] 对 大 卫 说 ， 你 比 我 公 义 。 因 为 你 以 善 待 我 ， 我 却 以 恶 待 你 。 [kjv] And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil. [bbe] And he said to David, You are right and I am wrong: for you have given me back good, but I have given you evil. 24:18 [hgb] 你 今 日 显 明 是 以 善 待 我 。 因 为 耶 和 华 将 我 交 在 你 手 里 ， 你 却 没 有 杀 我 。 [kjv] And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not. [bbe] And you have made clear to me how good you have been to me today: because, when the Lord gave me up into your hands, you did not put me to death. 24:19 [hgb] 人 若 遇 见 仇 敌 ， 岂 肯 放 他 平 安 无 事 地 去 呢 ？ 愿 耶 和 华 因 你 今 日 向 我 所 行 的 ， 以 善 报 你 。 [kjv] For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day. [bbe] If a man comes across his hater, will he let him get away safe? so may you be rewarded by the Lord for what you have done for me today. 24:20 [hgb] 我 也 知 道 你 必 要 作 王 ， 以 色 列 的 国 必 坚 立 在 你 手 里 。 [kjv] And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. [bbe] And now I am certain that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be made strong under your authority. 24:21 [hgb] 现 在 你 要 指 着 耶 和 华 向 我 起 誓 ， 不 剪 除 我 的 后 裔 ， 在 我 父 家 不 灭 没 我 的 名 。 [kjv] Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father\u0027s house. [bbe] So give me your oath by the Lord, that you will not put an end to my seed after me or let my name be cut off from my father\u0027s family. 24:22 [hgb] 于 是 大 卫 向 扫 罗 起 誓 ， 扫 罗 就 回 家 去 。 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 上 山 寨 去 了 。 [kjv] And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold. [bbe] And David gave Saul his oath. And Saul went back to his house; but David and his men went up to their safe place.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/575.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
