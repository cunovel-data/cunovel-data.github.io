But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. \n [bbe] Then Saul said to the servant who had the care of his arms, Take out your sword and put it through me, before these men without circumcision come and make sport of me. But his servant, full of fear, would not do so. Then Saul took out his sword, and falling on it, put an end to himself. \n 31:5 [hgb] 拿 兵 器 的 人 见 扫 罗 已 死 ， 也 伏 在 刀 上 死 了 。 \n [kjv] And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him. \n [bbe] And when his servant saw that Saul was dead, he did the same, and was united with him in death. \n 31:6 [hgb] 这 样 ， 扫 罗 和 他 三 个 儿 子 ， 与 拿 他 兵 器 的 人 ， 以 及 跟 随 他 的 人 ， 都 一 同 死 亡 。 \n [kjv] So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together. \n [bbe] So death overtook Saul and his three sons and his servant on the same day. \n 31:7 [hgb] 住 平 原 那 边 并 约 旦 河 西 的 以 色 列 人 ， 见 以 色 列 军 兵 逃 跑 ， 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 都 死 了 ， 也 就 弃 城 逃 跑 。 非 利 士 人 便 来 住 在 其 中 。 \n [kjv] And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. \n [bbe] And when the men of Israel across the valley and on the other side of Jordan saw that the army of Israel was in flight and that Saul and his sons were dead, they came out of their towns and went in flight; and the Philistines came and took them for themselves. \n 31:8 [hgb] 次 日 ， 非 利 士 人 来 剥 那 被 杀 之 人 的 衣 服 ， 看 见 扫 罗 和 他 三 个 儿 子 仆 倒 在 基 利 波 山 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa. \n [bbe] Now on the day after, when the Philistines came to take their goods from the dead, they saw Saul and his three sons dead on the earth in Mount Gilboa. \n 31:9 [hgb] 就 割 下 他 的 首 级 ， 剥 了 他 的 军 装 ， 打 发 人 到 非 利 士 地 的 四 境 （ 到 或 作 送 到 ） ， 报 信 与 他 们 庙 里 的 偶 像 和 众 民 。 \n [kjv] And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people. \n [bbe] And cutting off his head and taking away his war-dress, they sent word into the land of the Philistines round about, to take the news to their gods and to the people. \n 31:10 [hgb] 又 将 扫 罗 的 军 装 放 在 亚 斯 他 录 庙 里 ， 将 他 的 尸 身 钉 在 伯 珊 的 城 墙 上 。 \n [kjv] And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan. \n [bbe] His war-dress they put in the house of Astarte; and his body was fixed on the wall of Beth-shan. \n 31:11 [hgb] 基 列 雅 比 的 居 民 听 见 非 利 士 人 向 扫 罗 所 行 的 事 ， \n [kjv] And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul; \n [bbe] And when the people of Jabesh-gilead had news of what the Philistines had done to Saul, \n 31:12 [hgb] 他 们 中 间 所 有 的 勇 士 就 起 身 ， 走 了 一 夜 ， 将 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 的 尸 身 从 伯 珊 城 墙 上 取 下 来 ， 送 到 雅 比 那 里 ， 用 火 烧 了 。 \n [kjv] All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. \n [bbe] All the fighting men got up and, travelling all night, took Saul\u0027s body and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh and had them burned there. \n 31:13 [hgb] 将 他 们 骸 骨 葬 在 雅 比 的 垂 丝 柳 树 下 ， 就 禁 食 七 日 。 \n [kjv] And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. \n [bbe] And their bones they put in the earth under a tree in Jabesh; and for seven days they took no food. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/582.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
