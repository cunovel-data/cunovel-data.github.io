And David said, There is none like that; give it me. \n [bbe] And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you put to death in the valley of Elah, is here folded in a cloth at the back of the ephod: take that, if you will, for there is no other sword here. And David said, there is no other sword like that; give it to me. \n 21:10 [hgb] 那 日 大 卫 起 来 ， 躲 避 扫 罗 ， 逃 到 迦 特 王 亚 吉 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. \n [bbe] Then David got up and went in flight that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish, the king of Gath. \n 21:11 [hgb] 亚 吉 的 臣 仆 对 亚 吉 说 ， 这 不 是 以 色 列 国 王 大 卫 吗 ？ 那 里 的 妇 女 跳 舞 唱 和 ， 不 是 指 着 他 说 扫 罗 杀 死 千 千 ， 大 卫 杀 死 万 万 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? \n [bbe] And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David, the king of the land? did they not make songs about him in their dances, saying, Saul has put to death thousands, and David tens of thousands? \n 21:12 [hgb] 大 卫 将 这 话 放 在 心 里 ， 甚 惧 怕 迦 特 王 亚 吉 ， \n [kjv] And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. \n [bbe] And David took these words to heart, fearing Achish, the king of Gath. \n 21:13 [hgb] 就 在 众 人 面 前 改 变 了 寻 常 的 举 动 ， 在 他 们 手 下 假 装 疯 癫 ， 在 城 门 的 门 扇 上 胡 写 乱 画 ， 使 唾 沫 流 在 胡 子 上 。 \n [kjv] And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. \n [bbe] So changing his behaviour before them, he made it seem as if he was off his head, hammering on the doors of the town, and letting the water from his mouth go down his chin. \n 21:14 [hgb] 亚 吉 对 臣 仆 说 ， 你 们 看 ， 这 人 是 疯 子 。 为 什 么 带 他 到 我 这 里 来 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me? \n [bbe] Then Achish said to his servants, Look! the man is clearly off his head; why have you let him come before me? \n 21:15 [hgb] 我 岂 缺 少 疯 子 ， 你 们 带 这 人 来 在 我 面 前 疯 癫 吗 ？ 这 人 岂 可 进 我 的 家 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house? \n [bbe] Are there not enough unbalanced men about me, that you have let this person come and do such tricks before me? is such a man to come into my house? \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/572.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
