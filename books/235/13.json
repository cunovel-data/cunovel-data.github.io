And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jonathan made an attack on the armed force of the Philistines stationed at Gibeah; and news was given to the Philistines that the Hebrews were turned against them. And Saul had a horn sounded through all the land, \\n\\n 13:4 [hgb] 以 色 列 众 人 听 见 扫 罗 攻 击 非 利 士 人 的 防 营 ， 又 听 见 以 色 列 人 为 非 利 士 人 所 憎 恶 ， 就 跟 随 扫 罗 聚 集 在 吉 甲 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. \\n\\n [bbe] And all Israel had the news that Saul had made an attack on the Philistines, and that Israel was bitterly hated by the Philistines. And the people came together after Saul to Gilgal. \\n\\n 13:5 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 聚 集 ， 要 与 以 色 列 人 争 战 ， 有 车 三 万 辆 ， 马 兵 六 千 ， 步 兵 像 海 边 的 沙 那 样 多 ， 就 上 来 在 伯 亚 文 东 边 的 密 抹 安 营 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Philistines came together to make war on Israel, three thousand war-carriages and six thousand horsemen and an army of people like the sands of the sea in number: they came up and took up their position in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven. \\n\\n 13:6 [hgb] 以 色 列 百 姓 见 自 己 危 急 窘 迫 ， 就 藏 在 山 洞 ， 丛 林 ， 石 穴 ， 隐 密 处 ， 和 坑 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. \\n\\n [bbe] When the men of Israel saw the danger they were in, (for the people were troubled,) they took cover in cracks in the hillsides and in the woods and in rocks and holes and hollows. \\n\\n 13:7 [hgb] 有 些 希 伯 来 人 过 了 约 旦 河 ， 逃 到 迦 得 和 基 列 地 。 扫 罗 还 是 在 吉 甲 ， 百 姓 都 战 战 兢 兢 地 跟 随 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. \\n\\n [bbe] And a great number of the people had gone over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people went after him shaking in fear. \\n\\n 13:8 [hgb] 扫 罗 照 着 撒 母 耳 所 定 的 日 期 等 了 七 日 。 撒 母 耳 还 没 有 来 到 吉 甲 ， 百 姓 也 离 开 扫 罗 散 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. \\n\\n [bbe] And he went on waiting there for seven days, the time fixed by Samuel: but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were starting to go away from him. \\n\\n 13:9 [hgb] 扫 罗 说 ， 把 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 带 到 我 这 里 来 。 扫 罗 就 献 上 燔 祭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Saul said, Come here and give me the burned offering and the peace-offerings. And he made a burned offering to the Lord. \\n\\n 13:10 [hgb] 刚 献 完 燔 祭 ， 撒 母 耳 就 到 了 。 扫 罗 出 去 迎 接 他 ， 要 问 他 好 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the burned offering was ended, Samuel came; and Saul went out to see him and to give him a blessing. \\n\\n 13:11 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 说 ， 你 作 的 是 什 么 事 呢 ？ 扫 罗 说 ， 因 为 我 见 百 姓 离 开 我 散 去 ， 你 也 不 照 所 定 的 日 期 来 到 ， 而 且 非 利 士 人 聚 集 在 密 抹 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; \\n\\n [bbe] And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were going away from me, and you had not come at the time which had been fixed, and the Philistines had come together at Michmash; \\n\\n 13:12 [hgb] 所 以 我 心 里 说 ， 恐 怕 我 没 有 祷 告 耶 和 华 。 非 利 士 人 下 到 吉 甲 攻 击 我 ， 我 就 勉 强 献 上 燔 祭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. \\n\\n [bbe] I said, Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal, and I have made no prayer for help to the Lord: and so, forcing myself to do it, I made a burned offering. \\n\\n 13:13 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 对 扫 罗 说 ， 你 作 了 糊 涂 事 了 ， 没 有 遵 守 耶 和 华 你 神 所 吩 咐 你 的 命 令 。 若 遵 守 ， 耶 和 华 必 在 以 色 列 中 坚 立 你 的 王 位 ， 直 到 永 远 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. \\n\\n [bbe] And Samuel said to Saul, You have done a foolish thing: you have not kept the rules which the Lord your God gave you; it was the purpose of the Lord to make your authority over Israel safe for ever. \\n\\n 13:14 [hgb] 现 在 你 的 王 位 必 不 长 久 。 耶 和 华 已 经 寻 着 一 个 合 他 心 意 的 人 ， 立 他 作 百 姓 的 君 ， 因 为 你 没 有 遵 守 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 你 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee. \\n\\n [bbe] But now, your authority will not go on: the Lord, searching for a man who is pleasing to him in every way, has given him the place of ruler over his people, because you have not done what the Lord gave you orders to do. \\n\\n 13:15 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 就 起 来 ， 从 吉 甲 上 到 便 雅 悯 的 基 比 亚 。 扫 罗 数 点 跟 随 他 的 ， 约 有 六 百 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Samuel went up from Gilgal and the rest of the people went up after Saul against the men of war, and they came from Gilgal to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin: and Saul took the number of the people who were with him, about six hundred men. \\n\\n 13:16 [hgb] 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 约 拿 单 ， 并 跟 随 他 们 的 人 ， 都 住 在 便 雅 悯 的 迦 巴 。 但 非 利 士 人 安 营 在 密 抹 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. \\n\\n [bbe] And Saul, with Jonathan his son and the people who were with them, was waiting in Geba in the land of Benjamin: but the tents of the Philistines were in Michmash. \\n\\n 13:17 [hgb] 有 掠 兵 从 非 利 士 营 中 出 来 ， 分 为 三 队 ， 一 队 往 俄 弗 拉 向 书 亚 地 去 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: \\n\\n [bbe] And three bands of men came out from the Philistines to make an attack; one band went by the road which goes to Ophrah, into the land of Shual: \\n\\n 13:18 [hgb] 一 队 往 伯 和 仑 去 ， 一 队 往 洗 波 音 谷 对 面 的 地 境 向 旷 野 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. \\n\\n [bbe] And another went in the direction of Beth-horon: and another went by the hill looking down on the valley of Zeboiim, in the direction of the waste land. \\n\\n 13:19 [hgb] 那 时 ， 以 色 列 全 地 没 有 一 个 铁 匠 。 因 为 非 利 士 人 说 ， 恐 怕 希 伯 来 人 制 造 刀 枪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears: \\n\\n [bbe] Now there was no iron-worker in all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, For fear the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears: \\n\\n 13:20 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 要 磨 锄 ， 犁 ， 斧 ， 铲 ， 就 下 到 非 利 士 人 那 里 去 磨 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. \\n\\n [bbe] But all the Israelites had to go to the Philistines to get their ploughs and blades and axes and hooks made sharp; \\n\\n 13:21 [hgb] 但 有 锉 可 以 锉 铲 ， 犁 ， 三 齿 叉 ， 斧 子 ， 并 赶 牛 锥 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. \\n\\n [bbe] For they had instruments for putting an edge on their ploughs and blades and forks and axes, and for putting iron points on their ox-driving rods. \\n\\n 13:22 [hgb] 所 以 到 了 争 战 的 日 子 ， 跟 随 扫 罗 和 约 拿 单 的 人 没 有 一 个 手 里 有 刀 有 枪 的 ， 惟 独 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 约 拿 单 有 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. \\n\\n [bbe] So on the day of the fight at Michmash, not a sword or a spear was to be seen in the hands of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan: only Saul and his son Jonathan had them. \\n\\n 13:23 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 的 一 队 防 兵 到 了 密 抹 的 隘 口 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash. \\n\\n [bbe] And the armed force of the Philistines went out to the narrow way of Michmash. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/564.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
