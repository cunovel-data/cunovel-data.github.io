Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek. \n [bbe] Now at that time the Philistines came together to make war against Israel, and the men of Israel went out to war against the Philistines and took up their position at the side of Eben-ezer: and the Philistines put their forces in position in Aphek. \n 4:2 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 向 以 色 列 人 摆 阵 。 两 军 交 战 的 时 候 ， 以 色 列 人 败 在 非 利 士 人 面 前 。 非 利 士 人 在 战 场 上 杀 了 他 们 的 军 兵 约 有 四 千 人 。 \n [kjv] And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. \n [bbe] And the Philistines put their forces in order against Israel, and the fighting was hard, and Israel was overcome by the Philistines, who put to the sword about four thousand of their army in the field. \n 4:3 [hgb] 百 姓 回 到 营 里 ， 以 色 列 的 长 老 说 ， 耶 和 华 今 日 为 何 使 我 们 败 在 非 利 士 人 面 前 呢 ？ 我 们 不 如 将 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 从 示 罗 抬 到 我 们 这 里 来 ， 好 在 我 们 中 间 救 我 们 脱 离 敌 人 的 手 。 \n [kjv] And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies. \n [bbe] And when the people came back to their tents, the responsible men of Israel said, Why has the Lord let the Philistines overcome us today? Let us get the ark of the Lord\u0027s agreement here from Shiloh, so that it may be with us and give us salvation from the hands of those who are against us. \n 4:4 [hgb] 于 是 百 姓 打 发 人 到 示 罗 ， 从 那 里 将 坐 在 二 基 路 伯 上 万 军 之 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 抬 来 。 以 利 的 两 个 儿 子 何 弗 尼 ， 非 尼 哈 与 神 的 约 柜 同 来 。 \n [kjv] So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. \n [bbe] So the people sent to Shiloh and got the ark of the agreement of the Lord of armies whose resting-place is between the winged ones; and Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were there with the ark of God\u0027s agreement. \n 4:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 到 了 营 中 ， 以 色 列 众 人 就 大 声 欢 呼 ， 地 便 震 动 。 \n [kjv] And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again. \n [bbe] And when the ark of the Lord\u0027s agreement came into the tent-circle, all Israel gave a great cry, so that the earth was sounding with it. \n 4:6 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 听 见 欢 呼 的 声 音 ， 就 说 ， 在 希 伯 来 人 营 里 大 声 欢 呼 ， 是 什 么 缘 故 呢 ？ 随 后 就 知 道 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 到 了 营 中 。 \n [kjv] And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp. \n [bbe] And the Philistines, hearing the noise of their cry, said, What is this great cry among the tents of the Hebrews? Then it became clear to them that the ark of the Lord had come to the tent-circle. \n 4:7 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 就 惧 怕 起 来 ， 说 ， 有 神 到 了 他 们 营 中 。 又 说 ， 我 们 有 祸 了 。 向 来 不 曾 有 这 样 的 事 。 \n [kjv] And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. \n [bbe] And the Philistines, full of fear, said, God has come into their tents. And they said, Trouble is ours! for never before has such a thing been seen. \n 4:8 [hgb] 我 们 有 祸 了 。 谁 能 救 我 们 脱 离 这 些 大 能 之 神 的 手 呢 ？ 从 前 在 旷 野 用 各 样 灾 殃 击 打 埃 及 人 的 ， 就 是 这 些 神 。 \n [kjv] Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness. \n [bbe] Trouble is ours! Who will give us salvation from the hands of these great gods? These are the gods who sent all sorts of blows on the Egyptians in the waste land. \n 4:9 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 哪 ， 你 们 要 刚 强 ， 要 作 大 丈 夫 ， 免 得 作 希 伯 来 人 的 奴 仆 ， 如 同 他 们 作 你 们 的 奴 仆 一 样 。 你 们 要 作 大 丈 夫 ， 与 他 们 争 战 。 \n [kjv] Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight. \n [bbe] Be strong, O Philistines, be men! Do not be servants to the Hebrews as they have been to you: go forward to the fight without fear. \n 4:10 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 和 以 色 列 人 打 仗 ， 以 色 列 人 败 了 ， 各 向 各 家 奔 逃 ， 被 杀 的 人 甚 多 ， 以 色 列 的 步 兵 仆 倒 了 三 万 。 \n [kjv] And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. \n [bbe] So the Philistines went to the fight, and Israel was overcome, and every man went in flight to his tent: and great was the destruction, for thirty thousand footmen of Israel were put to the sword. \n 4:11 [hgb] 神 的 约 柜 被 掳 去 ， 以 利 的 两 个 儿 子 何 弗 尼 ， 非 尼 哈 也 都 被 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. \n [bbe] And the ark of God was taken; and Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were put to the sword. \n 4:12 [hgb] 当 日 ， 有 一 个 便 雅 悯 人 从 阵 上 逃 跑 ， 衣 服 撕 裂 ， 头 蒙 灰 尘 ， 来 到 示 罗 。 \n [kjv] And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. \n [bbe] And a man of Benjamin went running from the fight and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothing out of order and earth on his head. \n 4:13 [hgb] 到 了 的 时 候 ， 以 利 正 在 道 旁 坐 在 自 己 的 位 上 观 望 ， 为 神 的 约 柜 心 里 担 忧 。 那 人 进 城 报 信 ， 合 城 的 人 就 都 呼 喊 起 来 。 \n [kjv] And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. \n [bbe] And when he came, Eli was seated by the wayside watching: and in his heart was fear for the ark of God. And when the man came into the town and gave the news, there was a great outcry. \n 4:14 [hgb] 以 利 听 见 呼 喊 的 声 音 就 问 说 ， 这 喧 嚷 是 什 么 缘 故 呢 ？ 那 人 急 忙 来 报 信 给 以 利 。 \n [kjv] And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. \n [bbe] And Eli, hearing the noise and the cries, said, What is the reason of this outcry? And the man came quickly and gave the news to Eli. \n 4:15 [hgb] 那 时 以 利 九 十 八 岁 了 ， 眼 目 发 直 ， 不 能 看 见 。 \n [kjv] Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see. \n [bbe] Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were fixed so that he was not able to see. \n 4:16 [hgb] 那 人 对 以 利 说 ， 我 是 从 阵 上 来 的 ， 今 日 我 从 阵 上 逃 回 。 以 利 说 ， 我 儿 ， 事 情 怎 样 。 \n [kjv] And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son? \n [bbe] And the man said to Eli, I have come from the army and have come in flight today from the fight. And he said, How did it go, my son? \n 4:17 [hgb] 报 信 的 回 答 说 ， 以 色 列 人 在 非 利 士 人 面 前 逃 跑 ， 民 中 被 杀 的 甚 多 。 你 的 两 个 儿 子 何 弗 尼 ， 非 尼 哈 也 都 死 了 ， 并 且 神 的 约 柜 被 掳 去 。 \n [kjv] And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. \n [bbe] And the man said, Israel went in flight from the Philistines, and there has been great destruction among the people, and your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been taken. \n 4:18 [hgb] 他 一 提 神 的 约 柜 ， 以 利 就 从 他 的 位 上 往 后 跌 倒 ， 在 门 旁 折 断 颈 项 而 死 。 因 为 他 年 纪 老 迈 ， 身 体 沉 重 。 以 利 作 以 色 列 的 士 师 四 十 年 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years. \n [bbe] And at these words about the ark of God, Eli, falling back off his seat by the side of the doorway into the town, came down on the earth so that his neck was broken and death overtook him, for he was an old man and of great weight. He had been judging Israel for forty years. \n 4:19 [hgb] 以 利 的 儿 妇 ， 非 尼 哈 的 妻 怀 孕 将 到 产 期 ， 她 听 见 神 的 约 柜 被 掳 去 ， 公 公 和 丈 夫 都 死 了 ， 就 猛 然 疼 痛 ， 曲 身 生 产 。 \n [kjv] And his daughter in law, Phinehas\u0027 wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her. \n [bbe] And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child and near the time when she would give birth; and when she had the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, her pains came on her suddenly and she gave birth. \n 4:20 [hgb] 将 要 死 的 时 候 ， 旁 边 站 着 的 妇 人 们 对 她 说 ， 不 要 怕 。 你 生 了 男 孩 子 了 。 她 却 不 回 答 ， 也 不 放 在 心 上 。 \n [kjv] And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it. \n [bbe] And when she was very near death the women who were with her said, Have no fear, for you have given birth to a son. But she made no answer and gave no attention to it. \n 4:21 [hgb] 她 给 孩 子 起 名 叫 以 迦 博 ， 说 ， 荣 耀 离 开 以 色 列 了 。 这 是 因 神 的 约 柜 被 掳 去 ， 又 因 她 公 公 和 丈 夫 都 死 了 。 \n [kjv] And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband. \n [bbe] And she gave the child the name of Ichabod, saying, The glory has gone from Israel: because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband. \n 4:22 [hgb] 她 又 说 ， 荣 耀 离 开 以 色 列 ， 因 为 神 的 约 柜 被 掳 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken. \n [bbe] And she said, The glory is gone from Israel, for the ark of God has been taken. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/352.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
