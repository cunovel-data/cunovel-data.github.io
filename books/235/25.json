And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. \n [bbe] And death came to Samuel; and all Israel came together, weeping for him, and put his body in its resting-place in his house at Ramah. Then David went down to the waste land of Maon. \n 25:2 [hgb] 在 玛 云 有 一 个 人 ， 他 的 产 业 在 迦 密 ， 是 一 个 大 富 户 ， 有 三 千 绵 羊 ， 一 千 山 羊 。 他 正 在 迦 密 剪 羊 毛 。 \n [kjv] And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. \n [bbe] Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel; he was a great man and had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats: and he was cutting the wool of his sheep in Carmel. \n 25:3 [hgb] 那 人 名 叫 拿 八 ， 是 迦 勒 族 的 人 。 他 的 妻 名 叫 亚 比 该 ， 是 聪 明 俊 美 的 妇 人 。 拿 八 为 人 刚 愎 凶 恶 。 \n [kjv] Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. \n [bbe] Now this man was named Nabal, and his wife\u0027s name was Abigail: she was a woman of good sense and pleasing looks: but the man was cruel and evil in his ways; he was of the family of Caleb. \n 25:4 [hgb] 大 卫 在 旷 野 听 见 说 拿 八 剪 羊 毛 ， \n [kjv] And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep. \n [bbe] And David had word in the waste land that Nabal was cutting the wool of his sheep. \n 25:5 [hgb] 大 卫 就 打 发 十 个 仆 人 ， 吩 咐 他 们 说 ， 你 们 上 迦 密 去 见 拿 八 ， 提 我 的 名 问 他 安 。 \n [kjv] And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name: \n [bbe] And David sent ten young men, and said to them, Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal, and say kind words to him in my name; \n 25:6 [hgb] 要 对 那 富 户 如 此 说 ， 愿 你 平 安 ， 愿 你 家 平 安 ， 愿 你 一 切 所 有 的 都 平 安 。 \n [kjv] And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast. \n [bbe] And say this to my brother, May all be well for you: peace be to you and your house and all you have. \n 25:7 [hgb] 现 在 我 听 说 有 人 为 你 剪 羊 毛 ， 你 的 牧 人 在 迦 密 的 时 候 和 我 们 在 一 处 ， 我 们 没 有 欺 负 他 们 ， 他 们 也 未 曾 失 落 什 么 。 \n [kjv] And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel. \n [bbe] I have had word that you have wool-cutters: now the keepers of your sheep have been with us, and we have done them no evil, and taken nothing of theirs while they were in Carmel. \n 25:8 [hgb] 可 以 问 你 的 仆 人 ， 他 们 必 告 诉 你 。 所 以 愿 我 的 仆 人 在 你 眼 前 蒙 恩 ， 因 为 是 在 好 日 子 来 的 。 求 你 随 手 取 点 赐 与 仆 人 和 你 儿 子 大 卫 。 \n [kjv] Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David. \n [bbe] If your young men are questioned they will say the same thing. So now, let my young men have grace in your eyes, for we are come at a good time; please give anything you may have by you to your servants and to your son David. \n 25:9 [hgb] 大 卫 的 仆 人 到 了 ， 将 这 话 提 大 卫 的 名 都 告 诉 了 拿 八 ， 就 住 了 口 。 \n [kjv] And when David\u0027s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased. \n [bbe] And when David\u0027s young men came, they said all this to Nabal, in David\u0027s name, and said nothing more. \n 25:10 [hgb] 拿 八 回 答 大 卫 的 仆 人 说 ， 大 卫 是 谁 。 耶 西 的 儿 子 是 谁 。 近 来 悖 逆 主 人 奔 逃 的 仆 人 甚 多 ， \n [kjv] And Nabal answered David\u0027s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master. \n [bbe] And Nabal gave them his answer and said, Who is David? who is the son of Jesse? there are a number of servants in these days running away from their masters. \n 25:11 [hgb] 我 岂 可 将 饮 食 和 为 我 剪 羊 毛 人 所 宰 的 肉 给 我 不 知 道 从 哪 里 来 的 人 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be? \n [bbe] Am I to take my bread and my wine and the meat I have got ready for my wool-cutters and give it to men coming from I have no idea where? \n 25:12 [hgb] 大 卫 的 仆 人 就 转 身 从 原 路 回 去 ， 照 这 话 告 诉 大 卫 。 \n [kjv] So David\u0027s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings. \n [bbe] So David\u0027s young men, turning away, went back and gave him an account of everything he had said. \n 25:13 [hgb] 大 卫 向 跟 随 他 的 人 说 ， 你 们 各 人 都 要 带 上 刀 。 众 人 就 都 带 上 刀 ， 大 卫 也 带 上 刀 。 跟 随 大 卫 上 去 的 约 有 四 百 人 ， 留 下 二 百 人 看 守 器 具 。 \n [kjv] And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff. \n [bbe] And David said to his men, Put on your swords, every one of you. And every man put on his sword; and David did the same; and about four hundred men went up with David, and two hundred kept watch over their goods. \n 25:14 [hgb] 有 拿 八 的 一 个 仆 人 告 诉 拿 八 的 妻 亚 比 该 说 ， 大 卫 从 旷 野 打 发 使 者 来 问 我 主 人 的 安 ， 主 人 却 辱 骂 他 们 。 \n [kjv] But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal\u0027s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them. \n [bbe] But one of the young men said to Nabal\u0027s wife Abigail, David sent men from the waste land to say kind words to our master, and he gave them a rough answer. \n 25:15 [hgb] 但 是 那 些 人 待 我 们 甚 好 。 我 们 在 田 野 与 他 们 来 往 的 时 候 ， 没 有 受 他 们 的 欺 负 ， 也 未 曾 失 落 什 么 。 \n [kjv] But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields: \n [bbe] But these men have been very good to us; they did us no wrong and nothing of ours was touched while we were with them in the fields: \n 25:16 [hgb] 我 们 在 他 们 那 里 牧 羊 的 时 候 ， 他 们 昼 夜 作 我 们 的 保 障 。 \n [kjv] They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. \n [bbe] But day and night they were like a wall round us while we were with them, looking after the sheep. \n 25:17 [hgb] 所 以 你 当 筹 划 ， 看 怎 样 行 才 好 。 不 然 ， 祸 患 定 要 临 到 我 主 人 和 他 全 家 。 他 性 情 凶 暴 ， 无 人 敢 与 他 说 话 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him. \n [bbe] So now, give thought to what you are going to do; for evil is in store for our master and all his house: for he is such a good-for-nothing person that it is not possible to say anything to him. \n 25:18 [hgb] 亚 比 该 急 忙 将 二 百 饼 ， 两 皮 袋 酒 ， 五 只 收 拾 好 了 的 羊 ， 五 细 亚 烘 好 了 的 穗 子 ， 一 百 葡 萄 饼 ， 二 百 无 花 果 饼 ， 都 驮 在 驴 上 ， \n [kjv] Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. \n [bbe] Then Abigail quickly took two hundred cakes of bread and two skins full of wine and five sheep ready for cooking and five measures of dry grain and a hundred parcels of dry grapes and two hundred cakes of figs, and put them on asses. \n 25:19 [hgb] 对 仆 人 说 ， 你 们 前 头 走 ， 我 随 着 你 们 去 。 这 事 她 却 没 有 告 诉 丈 夫 拿 八 。 \n [kjv] And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal. \n [bbe] And she said to her young men, Go on in front of me and I will come after you. But she said nothing to her husband Nabal. \n 25:20 [hgb] 亚 比 该 骑 着 驴 ， 正 下 山 坡 ， 见 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 从 对 面 下 来 ， 亚 比 该 就 迎 接 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them. \n [bbe] Now while she was going down under cover of the mountain on her ass, David and his men came down against her, and suddenly she came face to face with them. \n 25:21 [hgb] 大 卫 曾 说 ， 我 在 旷 野 为 那 人 看 守 所 有 的 ， 以 致 他 一 样 不 失 落 ， 实 在 是 徒 然 了 。 他 向 我 以 恶 报 善 。 \n [kjv] Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good. \n [bbe] Now David had said, What was the use of my taking care of this man\u0027s goods in the waste land, so that there was no loss of anything which was his? he has only given me back evil for good. \n 25:22 [hgb] 凡 属 拿 八 的 男 丁 ， 我 若 留 一 个 到 明 日 早 晨 ， 愿 神 重 重 降 罚 与 我 。 \n [kjv] So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. \n [bbe] May God\u0027s punishment be on David, if when morning comes there is so much as one male of his people still living. \n 25:23 [hgb] 亚 比 该 见 大 卫 ， 便 急 忙 下 驴 ， 在 大 卫 面 前 脸 伏 于 地 叩 拜 ， \n [kjv] And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, \n [bbe] And when Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her ass, falling down on her face before him. \n 25:24 [hgb] 俯 伏 在 大 卫 的 脚 前 ， 说 ， 我 主 阿 ， 愿 这 罪 归 我 。 求 你 容 婢 女 向 你 进 言 ， 更 求 你 听 婢 女 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid. \n [bbe] And falling at his feet she said, May the wrong be on me, my lord, on me: let your servant say a word to you, and give ear to the words of your servant. \n 25:25 [hgb] 我 主 不 要 理 这 坏 人 拿 八 ， 他 的 性 情 与 他 的 名 相 称 。 他 名 叫 拿 八 （ 就 是 愚 顽 的 意 思 ） ， 他 为 人 果 然 愚 顽 。 但 我 主 所 打 发 的 仆 人 ， 婢 女 并 没 有 看 见 。 \n [kjv] Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. \n [bbe] Let my lord give no attention to Nabal, that good-for-nothing: for as his name is, so is he, a man without sense: but I, your servant, did not see the young men whom my lord sent. \n 25:26 [hgb] 我 主 阿 ， 耶 和 华 既 然 阻 止 你 亲 手 报 仇 ， 取 流 血 的 罪 ， 所 以 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 ， 又 敢 在 你 面 前 起 誓 说 ， 愿 你 的 仇 敌 和 谋 害 你 的 人 都 像 拿 八 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. \n [bbe] So now, my lord, by the living God and by your living soul, seeing that the Lord has kept you from the crime of blood and from taking into your hands the punishment for your wrongs, may all your haters, and those who would do evil to my lord, be like Nabal. \n 25:27 [hgb] 如 今 求 你 将 婢 女 送 来 的 礼 物 给 跟 随 你 的 仆 人 。 \n [kjv] And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord. \n [bbe] And let this offering, which your servant gives to my lord, be given to the young men who are with my lord. \n 25:28 [hgb] 求 你 饶 恕 婢 女 的 罪 过 。 耶 和 华 必 为 我 主 建 立 坚 固 的 家 ， 因 我 主 为 耶 和 华 争 战 。 并 且 在 你 平 生 的 日 子 查 不 出 有 什 么 过 来 。 \n [kjv] I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days. \n [bbe] And may the sin of your servant have forgiveness: for the Lord will certainly make your family strong, because my lord is fighting in the Lord\u0027s war; and no evil will be seen in you all your days. \n 25:29 [hgb] 虽 有 人 起 来 追 逼 你 ， 寻 索 你 的 性 命 ， 你 的 性 命 却 在 耶 和 华 你 的 神 那 里 蒙 保 护 ， 如 包 裹 宝 器 一 样 。 你 仇 敌 的 性 命 ， 耶 和 华 必 抛 去 ， 如 用 机 弦 甩 石 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling. \n [bbe] And though a man has taken up arms against you, putting your life in danger, still the soul of my lord will be kept safe among the band of the living with the Lord your God; and the souls of those who are against you he will send violently away from him, like stones from a bag. \n 25:30 [hgb] 我 主 现 在 若 不 亲 手 报 仇 流 无 辜 人 的 血 ， 到 了 耶 和 华 照 所 应 许 你 的 话 赐 福 与 你 ， 立 你 作 以 色 列 的 王 ， 那 时 我 主 必 不 至 心 里 不 安 ， 觉 得 良 心 有 亏 。 耶 和 华 赐 福 与 我 主 的 时 候 ， 求 你 记 念 婢 女 。 \n [kjv] And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel; \n [bbe] And when the Lord has done for my lord all those good things which he has said he will do for you, and has made you a ruler over Israel; \n 25:31 [hgb] \n [kjv] That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid. \n [bbe] Then you will have no cause for grief, and my lord\u0027s heart will not be troubled because you have taken life without cause and have yourself given punishment for your wrongs: and when the Lord has been good to you, then give a thought to your servant. \n 25:32 [hgb] 大 卫 对 亚 比 该 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 是 应 当 称 颂 的 ， 因 为 他 今 日 使 你 来 迎 接 我 。 \n [kjv] And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me: \n [bbe] And David said to Abigail, May the Lord, the God of Israel, be praised, who sent you to me today: \n 25:33 [hgb] 你 和 你 的 见 识 也 当 称 赞 。 因 为 你 今 日 拦 阻 我 亲 手 报 仇 ， 流 人 的 血 。 \n [kjv] And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand. \n [bbe] A blessing on your good sense and on you, who have kept me today from the crime of blood and from taking into my hands the punishment for my wrongs. \n 25:34 [hgb] 我 指 着 阻 止 我 加 害 于 你 的 耶 和 华 以 色 列 永 生 的 神 起 誓 ， 你 若 不 速 速 地 来 迎 接 我 ， 到 明 日 早 晨 ， 凡 属 拿 八 的 男 丁 必 定 不 留 一 个 。 \n [kjv] For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. \n [bbe] For truly, by the living Lord, the God of Israel, who has kept me from doing you evil, if you had not been so quick in coming to me and meeting me, by dawn there would not have been in Nabal\u0027s house so much as one male living. \n 25:35 [hgb] 大 卫 受 了 亚 比 该 送 来 的 礼 物 ， 就 对 她 说 ， 我 听 了 你 的 话 ， 准 了 你 的 情 面 ， 你 可 以 平 平 安 安 地 回 家 吧 。 \n [kjv] So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person. \n [bbe] Then David took from her hands her offering: and he said to her, Go back to your house in peace; see, I have given ear to your voice, and taken your offering with respect. \n 25:36 [hgb] 亚 比 该 到 拿 八 那 里 ， 见 他 在 家 里 设 摆 筵 席 ， 如 同 王 的 筵 席 。 拿 八 快 乐 大 醉 。 亚 比 该 无 论 大 小 事 都 没 有 告 诉 他 ， 就 等 到 次 日 早 晨 。 \n [kjv] And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal\u0027s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. \n [bbe] And Abigail went back to Nabal; and he was feasting in his house like a king; and Nabal\u0027s heart was full of joy, for he had taken much wine; so she said nothing to him till dawn came. \n 25:37 [hgb] 到 了 早 晨 ， 拿 八 醒 了 酒 ， 他 的 妻 将 这 些 事 都 告 诉 他 ， 他 就 魂 不 附 体 ， 身 僵 如 石 头 一 般 。 \n [kjv] But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. \n [bbe] And in the morning, when the effect of the wine was gone, Nabal\u0027s wife gave him an account of all these things, and all the heart went out of him, and he became like stone. \n 25:38 [hgb] 过 了 十 天 ， 耶 和 华 击 打 拿 八 ， 他 就 死 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died. \n [bbe] And about ten days after, the Lord sent disease on Nabal and death came to him. \n 25:39 [hgb] 大 卫 听 见 拿 八 死 了 ， 就 说 ， 应 当 称 颂 耶 和 华 ， 因 他 伸 了 拿 八 羞 辱 我 的 冤 ， 又 阻 止 仆 人 行 恶 。 也 使 拿 八 的 恶 归 到 拿 八 的 头 上 。 于 是 大 卫 打 发 人 去 ， 与 亚 比 该 说 ， 要 娶 她 为 妻 。 \n [kjv] And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife. \n [bbe] And David, hearing that Nabal was dead, said, May the Lord be praised, who has taken up my cause against Nabal for the shame which he put on me, and has kept back his servant from evil, and has sent on Nabal\u0027s head the reward of his evil-doing. And David sent word to Abigail, desiring to take her as his wife. \n 25:40 [hgb] 大 卫 的 仆 人 到 了 迦 密 见 亚 比 该 ， 对 她 说 ， 大 卫 打 发 我 们 来 见 你 ， 想 要 娶 你 为 妻 。 \n [kjv] And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife. \n [bbe] And when David\u0027s servants came to Carmel, to Abigail, they said to her, David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife. \n 25:41 [hgb] 亚 比 该 就 起 来 ， 俯 伏 在 地 ， 说 ， 我 情 愿 作 婢 女 ， 洗 我 主 仆 人 的 脚 。 \n [kjv] And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. \n [bbe] And she got up, and going down on her face to the earth, said, See, I am ready to be a servant-girl, washing the feet of the servants of my lord. \n 25:42 [hgb] 亚 比 该 立 刻 起 身 ， 骑 上 驴 ， 带 着 五 个 使 女 ， 跟 从 大 卫 的 使 者 去 了 ， 就 作 了 大 卫 的 妻 。 \n [kjv] And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife. \n [bbe] Then Abigail got up quickly and went on her ass, with five of her young women, after the men whom David had sent; and she became David\u0027s wife. \n 25:43 [hgb] 大 卫 先 娶 了 耶 斯 列 人 亚 希 暖 ， 她 们 二 人 都 作 了 他 的 妻 。 \n [kjv] David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives. \n [bbe] And David had taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, to be his wife; these two were his wives. \n 25:44 [hgb] 扫 罗 已 将 他 的 女 儿 米 甲 ， 就 是 大 卫 的 妻 ， 给 了 迦 琳 人 拉 亿 的 儿 子 帕 提 为 妻 。 \n [kjv] But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David\u0027s wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim. \n [bbe] Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David\u0027s wife, to Palti the son of Laish of Gallim. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/576.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
