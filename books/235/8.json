And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] But Samuel was not pleased when they said to him, Give us a king to be our judge. And Samuel made prayer to the Lord. \\n\\n 8:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 撒 母 耳 说 ， 百 姓 向 你 说 的 一 切 话 ， 你 只 管 依 从 。 因 为 他 们 不 是 厌 弃 你 ， 乃 是 厌 弃 我 ， 不 要 我 作 他 们 的 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord said to Samuel, Give ear to the voice of the people and what they say to you: they have not been turned away from you, but they have been turned away from me, not desiring me to be king over them. \\n\\n 8:8 [hgb] 自 从 我 领 他 们 出 埃 及 到 如 今 ， 他 们 常 常 离 弃 我 ， 事 奉 别 神 。 现 在 他 们 向 你 所 行 的 ， 是 照 他 们 素 来 所 行 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. \\n\\n [bbe] As they have done from the first, from the day when I took them out of Egypt till this day, turning away from me and worshipping other gods, so now they are acting in the same way to you. \\n\\n 8:9 [hgb] 故 此 你 要 依 从 他 们 的 话 ， 只 是 当 警 戒 他 们 ， 告 诉 他 们 将 来 那 王 怎 样 管 辖 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. \\n\\n [bbe] Give ear now to their voice: but make a serious protest to them, and give them a picture of the sort of king who will be their ruler. \\n\\n 8:10 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 将 耶 和 华 的 话 都 传 给 求 他 立 王 的 百 姓 ， 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. \\n\\n [bbe] And Samuel said all these words of the Lord to the people who were desiring a king. \\n\\n 8:11 [hgb] 管 辖 你 们 的 王 必 这 样 行 ， 他 必 派 你 们 的 儿 子 为 他 赶 车 ， 跟 马 ， 奔 走 在 车 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, This is the sort of king who will be your ruler: he will take your sons and make them his servants, his horsemen, and drivers of his war-carriages, and they will go running before his war-carriages; \\n\\n 8:12 [hgb] 又 派 他 们 作 千 夫 长 ， 五 十 夫 长 ， 为 他 耕 种 田 地 ， 收 割 庄 稼 ， 打 造 军 器 和 车 上 的 器 械 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. \\n\\n [bbe] And he will make them captains of thousands and of fifties; some he will put to work ploughing and cutting his grain and making his instruments of war and building his war-carriages. \\n\\n 8:13 [hgb] 必 取 你 们 的 女 儿 为 他 制 造 香 膏 ， 作 饭 烤 饼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. \\n\\n [bbe] Your daughters he will take to be makers of perfumes and cooks and bread-makers. \\n\\n 8:14 [hgb] 也 必 取 你 们 最 好 的 田 地 ， 葡 萄 园 ， 橄 榄 园 赐 给 他 的 臣 仆 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. \\n\\n [bbe] He will take your fields and your vine-gardens and your olive-gardens, all the best of them, and give them to his servants. \\n\\n 8:15 [hgb] 你 们 的 粮 食 和 葡 萄 园 所 出 的 ， 他 必 取 十 分 之 一 给 他 的 太 监 和 臣 仆 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. \\n\\n [bbe] He will take a tenth of your seed and of the fruit of your vines and give it to his servants. \\n\\n 8:16 [hgb] 又 必 取 你 们 的 仆 人 婢 女 ， 健 壮 的 少 年 人 和 你 们 的 驴 ， 供 他 的 差 役 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. \\n\\n [bbe] He will take your men-servants and your servant-girls, and the best of your oxen and your asses and put them to his work. \\n\\n 8:17 [hgb] 你 们 的 羊 群 ， 他 必 取 十 分 之 一 ， 你 们 也 必 作 他 的 仆 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. \\n\\n [bbe] He will take a tenth of your sheep: and you will be his servants. \\n\\n 8:18 [hgb] 那 时 你 们 必 因 所 选 的 王 哀 求 耶 和 华 ， 耶 和 华 却 不 应 允 你 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day. \\n\\n [bbe] Then you will be crying out because of your king whom you have taken for yourselves; but the Lord will not give you an answer in that day. \\n\\n 8:19 [hgb] 百 姓 竟 不 肯 听 撒 母 耳 的 话 ， 说 ， 不 然 。 我 们 定 要 一 个 王 治 理 我 们 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; \\n\\n [bbe] But the people gave no attention to the voice of Samuel; and they said, No, but we will have a king over us, \\n\\n 8:20 [hgb] 使 我 们 像 列 国 一 样 ， 有 王 治 理 我 们 ， 统 领 我 们 ， 为 我 们 争 战 。 \\n\\n [kjv] That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. \\n\\n [bbe] So that we may be like the other nations, and so that our king may be our judge and go out before us to war. \\n\\n 8:21 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 听 见 百 姓 这 一 切 话 ， 就 将 这 话 陈 明 在 耶 和 华 面 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Samuel, after hearing all the people had to say, went and gave an account of it to the Lord. \\n\\n 8:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 撒 母 耳 说 ， 你 只 管 依 从 他 们 的 话 ， 为 他 们 立 王 。 撒 母 耳 对 以 色 列 人 说 ， 你 们 各 归 各 城 去 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord said to Samuel, Give ear to their voice and make a king for them. Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let every man go back to his town. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/559.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
