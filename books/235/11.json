And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh. \\n\\n [bbe] Now Saul came from the field, driving the oxen before him; and he said, Why are the people weeping? And they gave him word of what the men of Jabesh had said. \\n\\n 11:6 [hgb] 扫 罗 听 见 这 话 ， 就 被 神 的 灵 大 大 感 动 ， 甚 是 发 怒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly. \\n\\n [bbe] And at their words, the spirit of God came on Saul with power, and he became very angry. \\n\\n 11:7 [hgb] 他 将 一 对 牛 切 成 块 子 ， 托 付 使 者 传 送 以 色 列 的 全 境 ， 说 ， 凡 不 出 来 跟 随 扫 罗 和 撒 母 耳 的 ， 也 必 这 样 切 开 他 的 牛 。 于 是 耶 和 华 使 百 姓 惧 怕 ， 他 们 就 都 出 来 ， 如 同 一 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent. \\n\\n [bbe] And he took two oxen and, cutting them up, sent them through all the land of Israel by the hand of runners, saying, If any man does not come out after Saul and Samuel, this will be done to his oxen. And the fear of the Lord came on the people and they came out like one man. \\n\\n 11:8 [hgb] 扫 罗 在 比 色 数 点 他 们 ， 以 色 列 人 有 三 十 万 ， 犹 大 人 有 三 万 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. \\n\\n [bbe] And he had them numbered in Bezek: the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. \\n\\n 11:9 [hgb] 众 人 对 那 使 者 说 ， 你 们 要 回 覆 基 列 雅 比 人 说 ， 明 日 太 阳 近 午 的 时 候 ， 你 们 必 得 解 救 。 使 者 回 去 告 诉 雅 比 人 ， 他 们 就 欢 喜 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he said to the representatives who had come, Say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is high, you will be made safe. And the representatives came and gave the news to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. \\n\\n 11:10 [hgb] 于 是 雅 比 人 对 亚 扪 人 说 ， 明 日 我 们 出 来 归 顺 你 们 ， 你 们 可 以 随 意 待 我 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you. \\n\\n [bbe] So the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you. \\n\\n 11:11 [hgb] 第 二 日 ， 扫 罗 将 百 姓 分 为 三 队 ， 在 晨 更 的 时 候 入 了 亚 扪 人 的 营 ， 击 杀 他 们 直 到 太 阳 近 午 ， 剩 下 的 人 都 逃 散 ， 没 有 二 人 同 在 一 处 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together. \\n\\n [bbe] Now on the day after, Saul put the people into three bands, and in the morning watch they came to the tents of the Ammonites, and they went on attacking them till the heat of the day: and those who were not put to death were put to flight in every direction, so that no two of them were together. \\n\\n 11:12 [hgb] 百 姓 对 撒 母 耳 说 ， 那 说 扫 罗 岂 能 管 理 我 们 的 是 谁 呢 ？ 可 以 将 他 交 出 来 ， 我 们 好 杀 死 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death. \\n\\n [bbe] And the people said to Samuel, Who was it who said, Is Saul to be our king? give the men up, so that we may put them to death. \\n\\n 11:13 [hgb] 扫 罗 说 ， 今 日 耶 和 华 在 以 色 列 中 施 行 拯 救 ， 所 以 不 可 杀 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] And Saul said, Not a man is to be put to death today: for today the Lord has made Israel safe. \\n\\n 11:14 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 对 百 姓 说 ， 我 们 要 往 吉 甲 去 ， 在 那 里 立 国 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Samuel said to the people, Come, let us go to Gilgal and there make the kingdom strong in the hands of Saul. \\n\\n 11:15 [hgb] 众 百 姓 就 到 了 吉 甲 那 里 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 立 扫 罗 为 王 ， 又 在 耶 和 华 面 前 献 平 安 祭 。 扫 罗 和 以 色 列 众 人 大 大 欢 喜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly. \\n\\n [bbe] So all the people went to Gilgal; and there in Gilgal they made Saul king before the Lord; and peace-offerings were offered before the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of Israel were glad with great joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/562.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
