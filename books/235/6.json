How are we to send it away to its place? \n 6:3 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 若 要 将 以 色 列 神 的 约 柜 送 回 去 ， 不 可 空 空 地 送 去 ， 必 要 给 他 献 赔 罪 的 礼 物 ， 然 后 你 们 可 得 痊 愈 ， 并 知 道 他 的 手 为 何 不 离 开 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. \n [bbe] And they said, If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it without an offering, but send him a sin-offering with it: then you will have peace again, and it will be clear to you why the weight of his hand has not been lifted from you. \n 6:4 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 说 ， 应 当 用 什 么 献 为 赔 罪 的 礼 物 呢 ？ 他 们 回 答 说 ， 当 照 非 利 士 首 领 的 数 目 ， 用 五 个 金 痔 疮 ， 五 个 金 老 鼠 ， 因 为 在 你 们 众 人 和 你 们 首 领 的 身 上 都 是 一 样 的 灾 。 \n [kjv] Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. \n [bbe] Then they said, What sin-offering are we to send to him? And they said, Five gold images of the growths caused by your disease and five gold mice, one for every lord of the Philistines: for the same disease came on you and on your lords. \n 6:5 [hgb] 所 以 当 制 造 你 们 痔 疮 的 像 和 毁 坏 你 们 田 地 老 鼠 的 像 ， 并 要 归 荣 耀 给 以 色 列 的 神 ， 或 者 他 向 你 们 和 你 们 的 神 ， 并 你 们 的 田 地 ， 把 手 放 轻 些 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. \n [bbe] So make images of the growths caused by your disease and of the mice which are damaging your land; and give glory to the God of Israel: it may be that the weight of his hand will be lifted from you and from your gods and from your land. \n 6:6 [hgb] 你 们 为 何 硬 着 心 像 埃 及 人 和 法 老 一 样 呢 ？ 神 在 埃 及 人 中 间 行 奇 事 ， 埃 及 人 岂 不 释 放 以 色 列 人 ， 他 们 就 去 了 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed? \n [bbe] Why do you make your hearts hard, like the hearts of Pharaoh and the Egyptians? When he had made sport of them, did they not let the people go, and they went away? \n 6:7 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 应 当 造 一 辆 新 车 ， 将 两 只 未 曾 负 轭 有 乳 的 母 牛 套 在 车 上 ， 使 牛 犊 回 家 去 ， 离 开 母 牛 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them: \n [bbe] So now, take and make ready a new cart, and two cows which have never come under the yoke, and have the cows yoked to the cart, and take their young ones away from them: \n 6:8 [hgb] 把 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 放 在 车 上 ， 将 所 献 赔 罪 的 金 物 装 在 匣 子 里 ， 放 在 柜 旁 ， 将 柜 送 去 。 \n [kjv] And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go. \n [bbe] And put the ark of the Lord on the cart, and the gold images which you are sending as a sin-offering in a chest by its side; and send it away so that it may go. \n 6:9 [hgb] 你 们 要 看 看 ， 车 若 直 行 以 色 列 的 境 界 到 伯 示 麦 去 ， 这 大 灾 就 是 耶 和 华 降 在 我 们 身 上 的 。 若 不 然 ， 便 可 以 知 道 不 是 他 的 手 击 打 我 们 ， 是 我 们 偶 然 遇 见 的 。 \n [kjv] And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us. \n [bbe] If it goes by the land of Israel to Beth-shemesh, then this great evil is his work; but if not, then we may be certain that the evil was not his doing, but was the working of chance. \n 6:10 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 就 这 样 行 ， 将 两 只 有 乳 的 母 牛 套 在 车 上 ， 将 牛 犊 关 在 家 里 ， \n [kjv] And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home: \n [bbe] And the men did so; they took two cows, yoking them to the cart and shutting up their young ones in their living-place: \n 6:11 [hgb] 把 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 和 装 金 老 鼠 并 金 痔 疮 像 的 匣 子 都 放 在 车 上 。 \n [kjv] And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods. \n [bbe] And they put the ark of the Lord on the cart and the chest with the gold images. \n 6:12 [hgb] 牛 直 行 大 道 ， 往 伯 示 麦 去 ， 一 面 走 一 面 叫 ， 不 偏 左 右 。 非 利 士 的 首 领 跟 在 后 面 ， 直 到 伯 示 麦 的 境 界 。 \n [kjv] And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh. \n [bbe] And the cows took the straight way, by the road to Beth-shemesh; they went by the highway, not turning to the right or to the left, and the sound of their voices was clear on the road; and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the edge of Beth-shemesh. \n 6:13 [hgb] 伯 示 麦 人 正 在 平 原 收 割 麦 子 ， 举 目 看 见 约 柜 ， 就 欢 喜 了 。 \n [kjv] And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. \n [bbe] And the people of Beth-shemesh were cutting their grain in the valley, and lifting up their eyes they saw the ark and were full of joy when they saw it. \n 6:14 [hgb] 车 到 了 伯 示 麦 人 约 书 亚 的 田 间 ， 就 站 住 了 。 在 那 里 有 一 块 大 磐 石 ， 他 们 把 车 劈 了 ， 将 两 只 母 牛 献 给 耶 和 华 为 燔 祭 。 \n [kjv] And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD. \n [bbe] And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and came to a stop there by a great stone: and cutting up the wood of the cart they made a burned offering of the cows to the Lord. \n 6:15 [hgb] 利 未 人 将 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 和 装 金 物 的 匣 子 拿 下 来 ， 放 在 大 磐 石 上 。 当 日 伯 示 麦 人 将 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 献 给 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD. \n [bbe] Then the Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest in which were the gold images, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh made burned offerings and gave worship that day before the Lord. \n 6:16 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 的 五 个 首 领 看 见 ， 当 日 就 回 以 革 伦 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day. \n [bbe] And the five lords of the Philistines, having seen it, went back to Ekron the same day. \n 6:17 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 献 给 耶 和 华 作 赔 罪 的 金 痔 疮 像 ， 就 是 这 些 ， 一 个 是 为 亚 实 突 ， 一 个 是 为 迦 萨 ， 一 个 是 为 亚 实 基 伦 ， 一 个 是 为 迦 特 ， 一 个 是 为 以 革 伦 。 \n [kjv] And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; \n [bbe] Now these are the gold images which the Philistines sent as a sin-offering to the Lord; one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron; \n 6:18 [hgb] 金 老 鼠 的 数 目 是 照 非 利 士 五 个 首 领 的 城 邑 ， 就 是 坚 固 的 城 邑 和 乡 村 ， 以 及 大 磐 石 。 这 磐 石 是 放 耶 和 华 约 柜 的 ， 到 今 日 还 在 伯 示 麦 人 约 书 亚 的 田 间 。 \n [kjv] And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite. \n [bbe] And the gold mice, one for every town of the Philistines, the property of the five lords, walled towns as well as country places: and the great stone where they put the ark of the Lord is still in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite to this day. \n 6:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 因 伯 示 麦 人 擅 观 他 的 约 柜 ， 就 击 杀 了 他 们 七 十 人 。 那 时 有 五 万 人 在 那 里 （ 原 文 作 七 十 人 加 五 万 人 ） 。 百 姓 因 耶 和 华 大 大 击 杀 他 们 ， 就 哀 哭 了 。 \n [kjv] And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter. \n [bbe] But the Lord sent destruction on seventy men of the people of Beth-shemesh for looking into the ark of the Lord; and great was the sorrow of the people for the destruction which the Lord had sent on them. \n 6:20 [hgb] 伯 示 麦 人 说 ， 谁 能 在 耶 和 华 这 圣 洁 的 神 面 前 侍 立 呢 ？ 这 约 柜 可 以 从 我 们 这 里 送 到 谁 那 里 去 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us? \n [bbe] And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to keep his place before the Lord, this holy God? and to whom may he go from us? \n 6:21 [hgb] 于 是 打 发 人 去 见 基 列 耶 琳 的 居 民 ， 说 ， 非 利 士 人 将 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 送 回 来 了 ， 你 们 下 来 将 约 柜 接 到 你 们 那 里 去 吧 。 \n [kjv] And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you. \n [bbe] And they sent men to the people living in Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have sent back the ark of the Lord; come and take it up to your country. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/557.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives;
