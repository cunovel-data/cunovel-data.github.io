Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth. \n [bbe] And the prophet Gad said to David, Do not go on living in this place but go into the land of Judah. Then David went away and came to the woodland of Hereth. \n 22:6 [hgb] 扫 罗 在 基 比 亚 的 拉 玛 ， 坐 在 垂 丝 柳 树 下 ， 手 里 拿 着 枪 ， 众 臣 仆 侍 立 在 左 右 。 扫 罗 听 见 大 卫 和 跟 随 他 的 人 在 何 处 ， \n [kjv] When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;) \n [bbe] And news was given to Saul that David had been seen, and the men who were with him: now Saul was in Gibeah, seated under the tree in the high place, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were in their places before him. \n 22:7 [hgb] 就 对 左 右 侍 立 的 臣 仆 说 ， 便 雅 悯 人 哪 ， 你 们 要 听 我 的 话 。 耶 西 的 儿 子 能 将 田 地 和 葡 萄 园 赐 给 你 们 各 人 吗 ？ 能 立 你 们 各 人 作 千 夫 长 百 夫 长 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds; \n [bbe] Then Saul said to his servants who were there about him, Give ear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give to every one of you fields and vine-gardens, will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands; \n 22:8 [hgb] 你 们 竟 都 结 党 害 我 。 我 的 儿 子 与 耶 西 的 儿 子 结 盟 的 时 候 ， 无 人 告 诉 我 。 我 的 儿 子 挑 唆 我 的 臣 子 谋 害 我 ， 就 如 今 日 的 光 景 ， 也 无 人 告 诉 我 ， 为 我 忧 虑 。 \n [kjv] That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? \n [bbe] That all of you have made designs against me, and not one of you gave me word when my son made an agreement with the son of Jesse, and not one of you has pity for me or has made my eyes open to the fact that my servant has been moved by my son against me, as at this day? \n 22:9 [hgb] 那 时 以 东 人 多 益 站 在 扫 罗 的 臣 仆 中 ， 对 他 说 ， 我 曾 看 见 耶 西 的 儿 子 到 了 挪 伯 ， 亚 希 突 的 儿 子 亚 希 米 勒 那 里 。 \n [kjv] Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. \n [bbe] Then Doeg, the Edomite, who was by the side of the servants of Saul, in answer said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub. \n 22:10 [hgb] 亚 希 米 勒 为 他 求 问 耶 和 华 ， 又 给 他 食 物 ， 并 给 他 杀 非 利 士 人 歌 利 亚 的 刀 。 \n [kjv] And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. \n [bbe] And he got directions from the Lord for him, and gave him food, and put in his hand the sword of Goliath the Philistine. \n 22:11 [hgb] 王 就 打 发 人 将 祭 司 亚 希 突 的 儿 子 亚 希 米 勒 和 他 父 亲 的 全 家 ， 就 是 住 挪 伯 的 祭 司 都 召 了 来 。 他 们 就 来 见 王 。 \n [kjv] Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father\u0027s house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king. \n [bbe] Then the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and for all the men of his father\u0027s family who were priests in Nob: and they all came to the king. \n 22:12 [hgb] 扫 罗 说 ， 亚 希 突 的 儿 子 ， 要 听 我 的 话 。 他 回 答 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 在 这 里 。 \n [kjv] And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord. \n [bbe] And Saul said, Give ear now, O son of Ahitub. And answering he said, Here I am, my lord. \n 22:13 [hgb] 扫 罗 对 他 说 ， 你 为 什 么 与 耶 西 的 儿 子 结 党 害 我 ， 将 食 物 和 刀 给 他 ， 又 为 他 求 问 神 ， 使 他 起 来 谋 害 我 ， 就 如 今 日 的 光 景 。 \n [kjv] And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? \n [bbe] And Saul said to him, Why have you made designs against me with the son of Jesse, giving him food and a sword and getting directions from the Lord for him, and helping him to take up arms against me, and to be on the watch to make a secret attack on me as he is doing now? \n 22:14 [hgb] 亚 希 米 勒 回 答 王 说 ， 王 的 臣 仆 中 有 谁 比 大 卫 忠 心 呢 ？ 他 是 王 的 女 婿 ， 又 是 王 的 参 谋 ， 并 且 在 王 家 中 是 尊 贵 的 。 \n [kjv] Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king\u0027s son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house? \n [bbe] Then Ahimelech answering said to the king, Who among all your servants is so true to you as David, who is the king\u0027s son-in-law, and is a captain of your armed men, and has a place of honour in your house? \n 22:15 [hgb] 我 岂 是 从 今 日 才 为 他 求 问 神 呢 ？ 断 不 是 这 样 。 王 不 要 将 罪 归 我 和 我 父 的 全 家 。 因 为 这 事 ， 无 论 大 小 ， 仆 人 都 不 知 道 。 \n [kjv] Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more. \n [bbe] Is this the first time I have got directions from God for him? Far be the thought! let the king make no such statement against his servant or my father\u0027s family, for your servant has no knowledge, great or small, of this thing. \n 22:16 [hgb] 王 说 ， 亚 希 米 勒 阿 ， 你 和 你 父 的 全 家 都 是 该 死 的 。 \n [kjv] And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father\u0027s house. \n [bbe] And the king said, You will certainly be put to death, Ahimelech, you and all your father\u0027s family. \n 22:17 [hgb] 王 就 吩 咐 左 右 的 侍 卫 说 ， 你 们 去 杀 耶 和 华 的 祭 司 。 因 为 他 们 帮 助 大 卫 ， 又 知 道 大 卫 逃 跑 ， 竟 没 有 告 诉 我 。 扫 罗 的 臣 子 却 不 肯 伸 手 杀 耶 和 华 的 祭 司 。 \n [kjv] And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD. \n [bbe] Then the king said to the runners who were waiting near him, Put the priests of the Lord to death; because they are on David\u0027s side, and having knowledge of his flight, did not give me word of it. But the king\u0027s servants would not put out their hands to make an attack on the Lord\u0027s priests. \n 22:18 [hgb] 王 吩 咐 多 益 说 ， 你 去 杀 祭 司 吧 。 以 东 人 多 益 就 去 杀 祭 司 ， 那 日 杀 了 穿 细 麻 布 以 弗 得 的 八 十 五 人 。 \n [kjv] And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. \n [bbe] Then the king said to Doeg, You are to put the priests to death. And Doeg the Edomite, turning on the priests and attacking them, put to death that day eighty-five men who took up the ephod. \n 22:19 [hgb] 又 用 刀 将 祭 司 城 挪 伯 中 的 男 女 ， 孩 童 ， 吃 奶 的 ， 和 牛 ， 羊 ， 驴 尽 都 杀 灭 。 \n [kjv] And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword. \n [bbe] And Nob, the town of the priests, he put to the sword, all the men and women, children and babies at the breast, and oxen and asses and sheep. \n 22:20 [hgb] 亚 希 突 的 儿 子 亚 希 米 勒 有 一 个 儿 子 ， 名 叫 亚 比 亚 他 ， 逃 到 大 卫 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. \n [bbe] And Abiathar, one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, got away and went in flight after David; \n 22:21 [hgb] 亚 比 亚 他 将 扫 罗 杀 耶 和 华 祭 司 的 事 告 诉 大 卫 。 \n [kjv] And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD\u0027s priests. \n [bbe] And gave him the news of how Saul had put to death the Lord\u0027s priests. \n 22:22 [hgb] 大 卫 对 亚 比 亚 他 说 ， 那 日 我 见 以 东 人 多 益 在 那 里 ， 就 知 道 他 必 告 诉 扫 罗 。 你 父 的 全 家 丧 命 ， 都 是 因 我 的 缘 故 。 \n [kjv] And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father\u0027s house. \n [bbe] And David said to Abiathar, I was certain that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would take the news to Saul: I am responsible for the lives of all your father\u0027s family. \n 22:23 [hgb] 你 可 以 住 在 我 这 里 ， 不 要 惧 怕 。 因 为 寻 索 你 命 的 就 是 寻 索 我 的 命 。 你 在 我 这 里 可 得 保 全 。 \n [kjv] Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard. \n [bbe] Keep here with me and have no fear; for he who has designs on my life has designs on yours: but with me you will be safe. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/573.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
