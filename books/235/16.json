Take oil in your vessel and go; I will send you to Jesse, the Beth-lehemite: for I have got a king for myself among his sons. \n 16:2 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 说 ， 我 怎 能 去 呢 ？ 扫 罗 若 听 见 ， 必 要 杀 我 。 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 可 以 带 一 只 牛 犊 去 ， 就 说 ， 我 来 是 要 向 耶 和 华 献 祭 。 \n [kjv] And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. \n [bbe] And Samuel said, How is it possible for me to go? If Saul gets news of it he will put me to death. And the Lord said, Take a young cow with you and say, I have come to make an offering to the Lord. \n 16:3 [hgb] 你 要 请 耶 西 来 吃 祭 肉 ， 我 就 指 示 你 所 当 行 的 事 。 我 所 指 给 你 的 人 ， 你 要 膏 他 。 \n [kjv] And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee. \n [bbe] And send for Jesse to be present at the offering, and I will make clear to you what you are to do: and you are to put the holy oil on him whose name I give you. \n 16:4 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 就 照 耶 和 华 的 话 去 行 。 到 了 伯 利 恒 ， 那 城 里 的 长 老 都 战 战 兢 兢 地 出 来 迎 接 他 ， 问 他 说 ， 你 是 为 平 安 来 的 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? \n [bbe] And Samuel did as the Lord said and came to Beth-lehem. And the responsible men of the town came out to him in fear and said, Do you come in peace? \n 16:5 [hgb] 他 说 ， 为 平 安 来 的 ， 我 是 给 耶 和 华 献 祭 。 你 们 当 自 洁 ， 来 与 我 同 吃 祭 肉 。 撒 母 耳 就 使 耶 西 和 他 众 子 自 洁 ， 请 他 们 来 吃 祭 肉 。 \n [kjv] And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. \n [bbe] And he said, In peace: I have come to make an offering to the Lord: make yourselves clean and come with me to make the offering. And he made Jesse and his sons clean, and sent for them to be present at the offering. \n 16:6 [hgb] 他 们 来 的 时 候 ， 撒 母 耳 看 见 以 利 押 ， 就 心 里 说 ， 耶 和 华 的 受 膏 者 必 定 在 他 面 前 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD\u0027s anointed is before him. \n [bbe] Now when they came, looking at Eliab, he said, Clearly the man of the Lord\u0027s selection is before him. \n 16:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 却 对 撒 母 耳 说 ， 不 要 看 他 的 外 貌 和 他 身 材 高 大 ， 我 不 拣 选 他 。 因 为 ， 耶 和 华 不 像 人 看 人 ， 人 是 看 外 貌 。 耶 和 华 是 看 内 心 。 \n [kjv] But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. \n [bbe] But the Lord said to Samuel, Do not take note of his face or how tall he is, because I will not have him: for the Lord\u0027s view is not man\u0027s; man takes note of the outer form, but the Lord sees the heart. \n 16:8 [hgb] 耶 西 叫 亚 比 拿 达 从 撒 母 耳 面 前 经 过 ， 撒 母 耳 说 ， 耶 和 华 也 不 拣 选 他 。 \n [kjv] Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. \n [bbe] Then Jesse sent for Abinadab and made him come before Samuel. And he said, The Lord has not taken this one. \n 16:9 [hgb] 耶 西 又 叫 沙 玛 从 撒 母 耳 面 前 经 过 ， 撒 母 耳 说 ， 耶 和 华 也 不 拣 选 他 。 \n [kjv] Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. \n [bbe] Then Jesse made Shammah come before him. And he said, The Lord has not taken this one. \n 16:10 [hgb] 耶 西 叫 他 七 个 儿 子 都 从 撒 母 耳 面 前 经 过 ， 撒 母 耳 说 ， 这 都 不 是 耶 和 华 所 拣 选 的 。 \n [kjv] Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these. \n [bbe] And Jesse made his seven sons come before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The Lord has not taken any of these. \n 16:11 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 对 耶 西 说 ， 你 的 儿 子 都 在 这 里 吗 ？ 他 回 答 说 ， 还 有 个 小 的 ， 现 在 放 羊 。 撒 母 耳 对 耶 西 说 ， 你 打 发 人 去 叫 他 来 。 他 若 不 来 ， 我 们 必 不 坐 席 。 \n [kjv] And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. \n [bbe] Then Samuel said to Jesse, Are all your children here? And he said, There is still the youngest, and he is looking after the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and make him come here: for we will not take our seats till he is here. \n 16:12 [hgb] 耶 西 就 打 发 人 去 叫 了 他 来 。 他 面 色 光 红 ， 双 目 清 秀 ， 容 貌 俊 美 。 耶 和 华 说 ， 这 就 是 他 ， 你 起 来 膏 他 。 \n [kjv] And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he. \n [bbe] So he sent and made him come in. Now he had red hair and beautiful eyes and pleasing looks. And the Lord said, Come, put the oil on him, for this is he. \n 16:13 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 就 用 角 里 的 膏 油 ， 在 他 诸 兄 中 膏 了 他 。 从 这 日 起 ， 耶 和 华 的 灵 就 大 大 感 动 大 卫 。 撒 母 耳 起 身 回 拉 玛 去 了 。 \n [kjv] Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. \n [bbe] Then Samuel took the bottle of oil, and put the oil on him there among his brothers: and from that day the spirit of the Lord came on David with power. So Samuel went back to Ramah. \n 16:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 灵 离 开 扫 罗 ， 有 恶 魔 从 耶 和 华 那 里 来 扰 乱 他 。 \n [kjv] But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. \n [bbe] Now the spirit of the Lord had gone from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord was troubling him. \n 16:15 [hgb] 扫 罗 的 臣 仆 对 他 说 ， 现 在 有 恶 魔 从 神 那 里 来 扰 乱 你 。 \n [kjv] And Saul\u0027s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. \n [bbe] And Saul\u0027s servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from God is troubling you. \n 16:16 [hgb] 我 们 的 主 可 以 吩 咐 面 前 的 臣 仆 ， 找 一 个 善 于 弹 琴 的 来 ， 等 神 那 里 来 的 恶 魔 临 到 你 身 上 的 时 候 ， 使 他 用 手 弹 琴 ， 你 就 好 了 。 \n [kjv] Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. \n [bbe] Now give orders to your servants who are here before you to go in search of a man who is an expert player on a corded instrument: and it will be that when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will make music for you on his instrument, and you will get well. \n 16:17 [hgb] 扫 罗 对 臣 仆 说 ， 你 们 可 以 为 我 找 一 个 善 于 弹 琴 的 ， 带 到 我 这 里 来 。 \n [kjv] And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me. \n [bbe] And Saul said to his servants, Then get me a man who is an expert player, and make him come to me. \n 16:18 [hgb] 其 中 有 一 个 少 年 人 说 ， 我 曾 见 伯 利 恒 人 耶 西 的 一 个 儿 子 善 于 弹 琴 ， 是 大 有 勇 敢 的 战 士 ， 说 话 合 宜 ， 容 貌 俊 美 ， 耶 和 华 也 与 他 同 在 。 \n [kjv] Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him. \n [bbe] Then one of the servants in answer said, I have seen a son of Jesse, the Beth-lehemite, who is expert at playing, and a strong man and a man of war; and he is wise in his words, and pleasing in looks, and the Lord is with him. \n 16:19 [hgb] 于 是 扫 罗 差 遣 使 者 去 见 耶 西 ， 说 ， 请 你 打 发 你 放 羊 的 儿 子 大 卫 到 我 这 里 来 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep. \n [bbe] So Saul sent his servants to Jesse and said, Send me your son David who is with the sheep. \n 16:20 [hgb] 耶 西 就 把 几 个 饼 和 一 皮 袋 酒 ， 并 一 只 山 羊 羔 ， 都 驮 在 驴 上 ， 交 给 他 儿 子 大 卫 ， 送 与 扫 罗 。 \n [kjv] And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul. \n [bbe] And Jesse took five cakes of bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them to Saul by David. \n 16:21 [hgb] 大 卫 到 了 扫 罗 那 里 ， 就 侍 立 在 扫 罗 面 前 。 扫 罗 甚 喜 爱 他 ， 他 就 作 了 扫 罗 拿 兵 器 的 人 。 \n [kjv] And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer. \n [bbe] And David came to Saul, waiting before him: and he became very dear to Saul, who made him his servant, giving him the care of his arms. \n 16:22 [hgb] 扫 罗 差 遣 人 去 见 耶 西 ， 说 ， 求 你 容 大 卫 侍 立 在 我 面 前 ， 因 为 他 在 我 眼 前 蒙 了 恩 。 \n [kjv] And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. \n [bbe] And Saul sent to Jesse saying, Let David be with me, for he is pleasing to me. \n 16:23 [hgb] 从 神 那 里 来 的 恶 魔 临 到 扫 罗 身 上 的 时 候 ， 大 卫 就 拿 琴 ， 用 手 而 弹 ， 扫 罗 便 舒 畅 爽 快 ， 恶 魔 离 了 他 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. \n [bbe] And whenever the evil spirit from God came on Saul, David took his instrument and made music: so new life came to Saul, and he got well, and the evil spirit went away from him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/567.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
