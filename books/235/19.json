[bbe] And Saul gave orders to his son Jonathan and to all his servants to put David to death. But Saul\u0027s son Jonathan had great delight in David. 19:2 [hgb] 约 拿 单 告 诉 大 卫 说 ， 我 父 扫 罗 想 要 杀 你 ， 所 以 明 日 早 晨 你 要 小 心 ， 到 一 个 僻 静 地 方 藏 身 。 [kjv] But Jonathan Saul\u0027s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself: [bbe] And Jonathan said to David, Saul, my father, is purposing your death: so now, take care in the morning, and keep yourself safe in a secret place: 19:3 [hgb] 我 就 出 到 你 所 藏 的 田 里 ， 站 在 我 父 亲 旁 边 与 他 谈 论 。 我 看 他 情 形 怎 样 ， 我 必 告 诉 你 。 [kjv] And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee. [bbe] And I will go out and take my place by my father\u0027s side in the field near where you are; and I will get into talk with my father about you, and when I see how things are, I will give you word. 19:4 [hgb] 约 拿 单 向 他 父 亲 扫 罗 替 大 卫 说 好 话 ， 说 ， 王 不 可 得 罪 王 的 仆 人 大 卫 。 因 为 他 未 曾 得 罪 你 ， 他 所 行 的 都 与 你 大 有 益 处 。 [kjv] And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good: [bbe] And Jonathan gave his father Saul a good account of David, and said to him, Let not the king do wrong against his servant, against David; because he has done you no wrong, and all his acts have had a good outcome for you: 19:5 [hgb] 他 拚 命 杀 那 非 利 士 人 ， 耶 和 华 为 以 色 列 众 人 大 行 拯 救 。 那 时 你 看 见 ， 甚 是 欢 喜 ， 现 在 为 何 无 故 要 杀 大 卫 ， 流 无 辜 人 的 血 ， 自 己 取 罪 呢 ？ [kjv] For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause? [bbe] For he put his life in danger and overcame the Philistine, and the Lord gave all Israel salvation: you saw it and were glad: why then are you sinning against him who has done no wrong, desiring the death of David without cause? 19:6 [hgb] 扫 罗 听 了 约 拿 单 的 话 ， 就 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 说 ， 我 必 不 杀 他 。 [kjv] And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain. [bbe] And Saul gave ear to the voice of Jonathan, and said with an oath, By the living Lord, he is not to be put to death. 19:7 [hgb] 约 拿 单 叫 大 卫 来 ， 把 这 一 切 事 告 诉 他 ， 带 他 去 见 扫 罗 。 他 就 仍 然 侍 立 在 扫 罗 面 前 。 [kjv] And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past. [bbe] Then Jonathan sent for David and gave him word of all these things. And Jonathan took David to Saul, who kept him by his side as in the past. 19:8 [hgb] 此 后 又 有 争 战 的 事 。 大 卫 出 去 与 非 利 士 人 打 仗 ， 大 大 杀 败 他 们 ， 他 们 就 在 他 面 前 逃 跑 。 [kjv] And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him. [bbe] And there was war again: and David went out fighting the Philistines, causing great destruction among them; and they went in flight before him. 19:9 [hgb] 从 耶 和 华 那 里 来 的 恶 魔 又 降 在 扫 罗 身 上 （ 扫 罗 手 里 拿 枪 坐 在 屋 里 ） ， 大 卫 就 用 手 弹 琴 。 [kjv] And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand. [bbe] And an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul, when he was seated in his house with his spear in his hand; and David made music for him. 19:10 [hgb] 扫 罗 用 枪 想 要 刺 透 大 卫 ， 钉 在 墙 上 。 他 却 躲 开 ， 扫 罗 的 枪 刺 入 墙 内 。 当 夜 大 卫 逃 走 ， 躲 避 了 。 [kjv] And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin, but he slipped away out of Saul\u0027s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night. [bbe] And Saul would have sent his spear through him, pinning him to the wall, but he got away and the spear went into the wall: and that night David went in flight and got away. 19:11 [hgb] 扫 罗 打 发 人 到 大 卫 的 房 屋 那 里 窥 探 他 ， 要 等 到 天 亮 杀 他 。 大 卫 的 妻 米 甲 对 他 说 ， 你 今 夜 若 不 逃 命 ， 明 日 你 要 被 杀 。 [kjv] Saul also sent messengers unto David\u0027s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David\u0027s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain. [bbe] Then in that night Saul sent men to David\u0027s house to keep watch on him so as to put him to death in the morning: and David\u0027s wife Michal said to him, If you do not go away to a safe place tonight you will be put to death in the morning. 19:12 [hgb] 于 是 米 甲 将 大 卫 从 窗 户 里 缒 下 去 。 大 卫 就 逃 走 ， 躲 避 了 。 [kjv] So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped. [bbe] So Michal let David down through the window, and he went in flight and got away. 19:13 [hgb] 米 甲 把 家 中 的 神 像 放 在 床 上 ， 头 枕 在 山 羊 毛 装 的 枕 头 上 ， 用 被 遮 盖 。 [kjv] And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats\u0027 hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth. [bbe] Then Michal took the image and put it in the bed, with a cushion of goat\u0027s hair at its head, and she put clothing over it. 19:14 [hgb] 扫 罗 打 发 人 去 捉 拿 大 卫 ， 米 甲 说 ， 他 病 了 。 [kjv] And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick. [bbe] And when Saul sent men to take David, she said, He is ill. 19:15 [hgb] 扫 罗 又 打 发 人 去 看 大 卫 ， 说 ， 当 连 床 将 他 抬 来 ， 我 好 杀 他 。 [kjv] And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him. [bbe] And Saul sent his men to see David, saying, Do not come back without him, take him in his bed, so that I may put him to death. 19:16 [hgb] 使 者 进 去 ， 看 见 床 上 有 神 像 ， 头 枕 在 山 羊 毛 装 的 枕 头 上 。 [kjv] And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats\u0027 hair for his bolster. [bbe] And when the men came in, there was the image in the bed, with the cushion of goat\u0027s hair at its head 19:17 [hgb] 扫 罗 对 米 甲 说 ， 你 为 什 么 这 样 欺 哄 我 ， 放 我 仇 敌 逃 走 呢 ？ 米 甲 回 答 说 ， 他 对 我 说 ， 你 放 我 走 ， 不 然 我 要 杀 你 。 [kjv] And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee? [bbe] And Saul said to Michal, why have you been false to me, letting my hater go and get safely away? And in answer Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go, or I will put you to death. 19:18 [hgb] 大 卫 逃 避 ， 来 到 拉 玛 见 撒 母 耳 ， 将 扫 罗 向 他 所 行 的 事 述 说 了 一 遍 。 他 和 撒 母 耳 就 往 拿 约 去 居 住 。 [kjv] So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth. [bbe] So David went in flight and got away and came to Ramah, to Samuel, and gave him an account of all Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and were living in Naioth. 19:19 [hgb] 有 人 告 诉 扫 罗 ， 说 大 卫 在 拉 玛 的 拿 约 。 [kjv] And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah. [bbe] And word was given to Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah. 19:20 [hgb] 扫 罗 打 发 人 去 捉 拿 大 卫 。 去 的 人 见 有 一 班 先 知 都 受 感 说 话 ， 撒 母 耳 站 在 其 中 监 管 他 们 。 打 发 去 的 人 也 受 神 的 灵 感 动 说 话 。 [kjv] And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. [bbe] And Saul sent men to take David; and when they saw the band of prophets at work, with Samuel in his place at their head, the spirit of God came on Saul\u0027s men, and they became like prophets. 19:21 [hgb] 有 人 将 这 事 告 诉 扫 罗 ， 他 又 打 发 人 去 ， 他 们 也 受 感 说 话 。 扫 罗 第 三 次 打 发 人 去 ， 他 们 也 受 感 说 话 。 [kjv] And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also. [bbe] And Saul, having news of this, sent other men, who in the same way became like prophets. And a third time Saul sent men, and they like the others became like prophets. 19:22 [hgb] 然 后 扫 罗 自 己 往 拉 玛 去 ， 到 了 西 沽 的 大 井 ， 问 人 说 ， 撒 母 耳 和 大 卫 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 有 人 说 ， 在 拉 玛 的 拿 约 。 [kjv] Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah. [bbe] Then he himself went to Ramah, and came to the great water-spring in Secu; and questioning the people he said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, They are at Naioth in Ramah. 19:23 [hgb] 他 就 往 拉 玛 的 拿 约 去 。 神 的 灵 也 感 动 他 ， 一 面 走 一 面 说 话 ， 直 到 拉 玛 的 拿 约 。 [kjv] And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. [bbe] And he went on from there to Naioth in Ramah: and the spirit of God came on him, and he went on, acting like a prophet, till he came to Naioth in Ramah. 19:24 [hgb] 他 就 脱 了 衣 服 ， 在 撒 母 耳 面 前 受 感 说 话 ， 一 昼 一 夜 露 体 躺 卧 。 因 此 有 句 俗 语 说 ， 扫 罗 也 列 在 先 知 中 吗 ？ [kjv] And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets? [bbe] And he took off his clothing, acting like a prophet before Samuel, and falling down he was stretched out, without his clothing, all that day and all that night. This is the reason for the saying, Is even Saul among the prophets?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/570.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
