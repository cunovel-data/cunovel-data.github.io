{"id":7205,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"3:1 [hgb] 童 子 撒 母 耳 在 以 利 面 前 事 奉 耶 和 华 。 当 那 些 日 子 ， 耶 和 华 的 言 语 稀 少 ， 不 常 有 默 示 。 [kjv] And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision. [bbe] Now the young Samuel was the servant of the Lord before Eli. In those days the Lord kept his word secret from men; there was no open vision. 3:2 [hgb] 一 日 ， 以 利 睡 卧 在 自 己 的 地 方 。 他 眼 目 昏 花 ， 看 不 分 明 。 [kjv] And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; [bbe] And at that time, when Eli was resting in his place, (now his eyes were becoming clouded so that he was not able to see,) 3:3 [hgb] 神 的 灯 在 神 耶 和 华 殿 内 约 柜 那 里 ， 还 没 有 熄 灭 ， 撒 母 耳 已 经 睡 了 。 [kjv] And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; [bbe] And the light of God was still burning, while Samuel was sleeping in the Temple of the Lord where the ark of God was, 3:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 呼 唤 撒 母 耳 。 撒 母 耳 说 ， 我 在 这 里 。 [kjv] That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I. [bbe] The voice of the Lord said Samuel\u0027s name; and he said, Here am I. 3:5 [hgb] 就 跑 到 以 利 那 里 ， 说 ， 你 呼 唤 我 。 我 在 这 里 。 以 利 回 答 说 ， 我 没 有 呼 唤 你 ， 你 去 睡 吧 。 他 就 去 睡 了 。 [kjv] And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. [bbe] And running to Eli he said, Here am I, for you said my name. And Eli said, I did not say your name; go to your rest again. So he went back to his bed. 3:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 又 呼 唤 撒 母 耳 。 撒 母 耳 起 来 ， 到 以 利 那 里 ， 说 ， 你 呼 唤 我 。 我 在 这 里 。 以 利 回 答 说 ， 我 的 儿 ， 我 没 有 呼 唤 你 ， 你 去 睡 吧 。 [kjv] And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. [bbe] And again the Lord said, Samuel. And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, Here am I; for you certainly said my name. But he said in answer, I said nothing, my son; go to your rest again. 3:7 [hgb] 那 时 撒 母 耳 还 未 认 识 耶 和 华 ， 也 未 得 耶 和 华 的 默 示 。 [kjv] Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. [bbe] Now at that time Samuel had no knowledge of the Lord, and the revelation of the word of the Lord had not come to him. 3:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 第 三 次 呼 唤 撒 母 耳 。 撒 母 耳 起 来 ， 到 以 利 那 里 ， 说 ， 你 又 呼 唤 我 。 我 在 这 里 。 以 利 才 明 白 是 耶 和 华 呼 唤 童 子 。 [kjv] And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child. [bbe] And for the third time the Lord said Samuel\u0027s name. And he got up and went to Eli and said, Here am I; for you certainly said my name. Then it was clear to Eli that the voice which had said the child\u0027s name was the Lord\u0027s. 3:9 [hgb] 因 此 以 利 对 撒 母 耳 说 ， 你 仍 去 睡 吧 。 若 再 呼 唤 你 ， 你 就 说 ， 耶 和 华 阿 ， 请 说 ， 仆 人 敬 听 。 撒 母 耳 就 去 ， 仍 睡 在 原 处 。 [kjv] Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. [bbe] So Eli said to Samuel, Go back: and if the voice comes again, let your answer be, Say on, Lord; for the ears of your servant are open. So Samuel went back to his bed. 3:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 又 来 站 着 ， 像 前 三 次 呼 唤 说 ， 撒 母 耳 阿 。 撒 母 耳 阿 。 撒 母 耳 回 答 说 ， 请 说 ， 仆 人 敬 听 。 [kjv] And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. [bbe] Then the Lord came and said as before, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel made answer, Say on, Lord; for the ears of your servant are open. 3:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 撒 母 耳 说 ， 我 在 以 色 列 中 必 行 一 件 事 ， 叫 听 见 的 人 都 必 耳 鸣 。 [kjv] And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. [bbe] And the Lord said to Samuel, See, I will do a thing in Israel at which the ears of everyone hearing of it will be burning. 3:12 [hgb] 我 指 着 以 利 家 所 说 的 话 ， 到 了 时 候 ， 我 必 始 终 应 验 在 以 利 身 上 。 [kjv] In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. [bbe] In that day I will do to Eli everything which I have said about his family, from first to last. 3:13 [hgb] 我 曾 告 诉 他 必 永 远 降 罚 与 他 的 家 ， 因 他 知 道 儿 子 作 孽 ， 自 招 咒 诅 ， 却 不 禁 止 他 们 。 [kjv] For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. [bbe] And you are to say to him that I will send punishment on his family for ever, for the sin which he had knowledge of; because his sons have been cursing God and he had no control over them. 3:14 [hgb] 所 以 我 向 以 利 家 起 誓 说 ， 以 利 家 的 罪 孽 ， 虽 献 祭 奉 礼 物 ， 永 不 能 得 赎 去 。 [kjv] And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli\u0027s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. [bbe] So I have made an oath to the family of Eli that no offering of meat or of meal which they may make will ever take away the sin of his family. 3:15 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 睡 到 天 亮 ， 就 开 了 耶 和 华 的 殿 门 ， 不 敢 将 默 示 告 诉 以 利 。 [kjv] And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. [bbe] And Samuel kept where he was, not moving till the time came for opening the doors of the house of God in the morning. And fear kept him from giving Eli an account of his vision. 3:16 [hgb] 以 利 呼 唤 撒 母 耳 说 ， 我 儿 撒 母 耳 阿 。 撒 母 耳 回 答 说 ， 我 在 这 里 。 [kjv] Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I. [bbe] Then Eli said, Samuel, my son. And Samuel answering said, Here am I. 3:17 [hgb] 以 利 说 ， 耶 和 华 对 你 说 什 么 ， 你 不 要 向 我 隐 瞒 。 你 若 将 神 对 你 所 说 的 隐 瞒 一 句 ， 愿 他 重 重 地 降 罚 与 你 。 [kjv] And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. [bbe] And he said, What did the Lord say to you? Do not keep it from me: may God\u0027s punishment be on you if you keep from me anything he said to you. 3:18 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 就 把 一 切 话 都 告 诉 了 以 利 ， 并 没 有 隐 瞒 。 以 利 说 ， 这 是 出 于 耶 和 华 ， 愿 他 凭 自 己 的 意 旨 而 行 。 [kjv] And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good. [bbe] Then Samuel gave him an account of everything, keeping nothing back. And he said, It is the Lord; let him do what seems good to him. 3:19 [hgb] 撒 母 耳 长 大 了 ， 耶 和 华 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 所 说 的 话 一 句 都 不 落 空 。 [kjv] And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. [bbe] And Samuel became older, and the Lord was with him and let not one of his words be without effect. 3:20 [hgb] 从 但 到 别 是 巴 所 有 的 以 色 列 人 ， 都 知 道 耶 和 华 立 撒 母 耳 为 先 知 。 [kjv] And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. [bbe] And it was clear to all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba that Samuel had been made a prophet of the Lord. 3:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 又 在 示 罗 显 现 。 因 为 耶 和 华 将 自 己 的 话 默 示 撒 母 耳 ， 撒 母 耳 就 把 这 话 传 遍 以 色 列 地 。 [kjv] And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD. [bbe] And the Lord was seen again in Shiloh; for the Lord gave to Samuel in Shiloh the revelation of his word.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/351.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
