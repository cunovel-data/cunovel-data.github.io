And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the people of Ashdod got up early on the morning after, they saw that Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon up and put him in his place again. \\n\\n 5:4 [hgb] 又 次 日 清 早 起 来 ， 见 大 衮 仆 倒 在 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 前 ， 脸 伏 于 地 ， 并 且 大 衮 的 头 和 两 手 都 在 门 槛 上 折 断 ， 只 剩 下 大 衮 的 残 体 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him. \\n\\n [bbe] And when they got up early on the morning after, Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord; and his head and his hands were broken off on the doorstep; only the base was in its place. \\n\\n 5:5 [hgb] 因 此 ， 大 衮 的 祭 司 和 一 切 进 亚 实 突 ， 大 衮 庙 的 人 都 不 踏 大 衮 庙 的 门 槛 ， 直 到 今 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon\u0027s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day. \\n\\n [bbe] So to this day no priest of Dagon, or any who come into Dagon\u0027s house, will put his foot on the doorstep of the house of Dagon in Ashdod. \\n\\n 5:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 手 重 重 加 在 亚 实 突 人 身 上 ， 败 坏 他 们 ， 使 他 们 生 痔 疮 。 亚 实 突 和 亚 实 突 的 四 境 都 是 如 此 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof. \\n\\n [bbe] But the hand of the Lord was hard on the people of Ashdod and he sent disease on them through all the country of Ashdod. \\n\\n 5:7 [hgb] 亚 实 突 人 见 这 光 景 ， 就 说 ， 以 色 列 神 的 约 柜 不 可 留 在 我 们 这 里 ， 因 为 他 的 手 重 重 加 在 我 们 和 我 们 神 大 衮 的 身 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was, they said, Let not the ark of the God of Israel be with us, for his hand is hard on us and on Dagon our god. \\n\\n 5:8 [hgb] 就 打 发 人 去 请 非 利 士 的 众 首 领 来 聚 集 ， 问 他 们 说 ， 我 们 向 以 色 列 神 的 约 柜 应 当 怎 样 行 呢 ？ 他 们 回 答 说 ， 可 以 将 以 色 列 神 的 约 柜 运 到 迦 特 去 。 于 是 将 以 色 列 神 的 约 柜 运 到 那 里 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither. \\n\\n [bbe] So they sent for all the lords of the Philistines to come together there, and said, What are we to do with the ark of the God of Israel? And their answer was, Let the ark of the God of Israel be taken away to Gath. So they took the ark of the God of Israel away. \\n\\n 5:9 [hgb] 运 到 之 后 ， 耶 和 华 的 手 攻 击 那 城 ， 使 那 城 的 人 大 大 惊 慌 ， 无 论 大 小 都 生 痔 疮 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts. \\n\\n [bbe] But after they had taken it away, the hand of the Lord was stretched out against the town for its destruction: and the signs of disease came out on all the men of the town, small and great. \\n\\n 5:10 [hgb] 他 们 就 把 神 的 约 柜 送 到 以 革 伦 。 神 的 约 柜 到 了 ， 以 革 伦 人 就 喊 嚷 起 来 说 ， 他 们 将 以 色 列 神 的 约 柜 运 到 我 们 这 里 ， 要 害 我 们 和 我 们 的 众 民 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. \\n\\n [bbe] So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And when the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of the town made an outcry, saying, They have sent the ark of the God of Israel to us for the destruction of us and of our people. \\n\\n 5:11 [hgb] 于 是 打 发 人 去 请 非 利 士 的 众 首 领 来 ， 说 ， 愿 你 们 将 以 色 列 神 的 约 柜 送 回 原 处 ， 免 得 害 了 我 们 和 我 们 的 众 民 。 原 来 神 的 手 重 重 攻 击 那 城 ， 城 中 的 人 有 因 惊 慌 而 死 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. \\n\\n [bbe] So they sent and got together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its place, so that it may not be the cause of death to us and to our people: for there was a great fear of death through all the town; the hand of God was very hard on them there. \\n\\n 5:12 [hgb] 未 曾 死 的 人 都 生 了 痔 疮 。 合 城 呼 号 ， 声 音 上 达 于 天 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven. \\n\\n [bbe] And those men who were not overtaken by death were cruelly diseased: and the cry of the town went up to heaven. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25/353.html","bookId":235,"book":{"id":235,"title":"Samuel撒母耳记上（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/25","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
