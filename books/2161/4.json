{"id":97465,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Kaanyr Vhok, the half-demon prince known as the Sceptered One, stood on a high balcony over the old dwarven foundry and watched his armor-ers at work. The great smelter had once been the heart of the fallen realm of Ammarindar. The cavern was immense, and its roof rested upon dozens of towering pillars carved into the shapes of dragons, glowing red with angry firelight and the lurid radiance of molten metal. The clanging of hammers and roar of kilns at work filled the air. Dozens of hulking tanarukks, bestial fiends bred from orcs and demons, toiled on the foundry floor. They might have lacked the skill and enchantments of the dwarves who once worked there, but Kaanyr Vhok\u0027s soldiers possessed a cunning instinct for the making of deadly weapons infused with dark lore.\n Kaanyr himself fit the infernal scene well. Tall and powerful, he had the stature of a strong-thewed human warrior and the strength of a stone giant. His skin was red and hot to the touch, and his flesh was hard enough to turn a blade. He was strikingly handsome, though his eyes danced with malice and his teeth were as black as coal. He wore a golden breastplate and carried a pair of wicked short swords made from some demonic black iron in rune-chased scabbards at his belt. He grinned fiercely with delight as he looked out over the gathering storm of his army.\n \"I now lead nearly two thousand tanarukk warriors,\" he said over his shoulder, \"and I have just as many orcs, ogres, trolls, and giants at my com-mand. I think the time has come to try my strength, my love.\"\n Aliisza allowed herself a smile and moved closer, pressing herself to the demon prince\u0027s side. Like Kaanyr Vhok, she too possessed demonic blood. In her case, she was an alu-fiend, the spawn of a succubus and some mortal sorcerer. Wings as smooth as black leather sprouted from her shoulder blades, but other than that she was dusky and seductive, voluptuous and inviting, a half-demoness whose allure few mortal men could resist.She was also clever, capricious, and very skilled in magic, and therefore well-suited to be the consort of a demonspawned warlord such as Kaanyr.\n \"Menzoberranzan?\" she purred, tracing the filigree of his armor with one fingertip.\n \"Of course. There seems to be nothing worth the taking in Ched Nasad, after all.\" Kaanyr frowned, and his gaze grew distant. \"If the dark elves are without the protection of their spider goddess, and unable to govern their interminable feuds, I may have an opportunity to seize the greatness I have always coveted. Having mastered the ruins of Ammarindar, I find that I hunger for something more. Subjugating a city of drow appeals to me.\"\n \"Others have had that thought,\" Aliisza pointed out. \"The Men-zoberranyr I spoke with in Ched Nasad suggested that his own city had suffered a significant slave uprising, sponsored by some outside agency. I think the duergar mercenaries who fought in Ched Nasad would not have left the city to whatever House hired them, once they\u0027d managed to take it. If the duergar firebombs hadn\u0027t worked so well, I suspect Clan Xorn-bane would rule Ched Nasad now.\"\n \"Or I would,\" Kaanyr said. He narrowed his eyes. \"If you had re-ported the situation to me in a more timely manner, I might have been able to bring my army against Ched Nasad when the drow and duergar were exhausted from fighting each other.\"\n Aliisza licked her lips.\n \"You would have lost whatever forces you brought into the city,\" she replied. \"Your tanarukks could have endured the fires, of course, but the collapse of the city streets destroyed everything in the cavern. Trust me, you missed no opportunities in Ched Nasad.\"\n Kaanyr did not reply. Instead, he disentangled himself from Aliisza and vaulted lightly over the balcony rail, descending to the foundry floor. The warlord had no wings, but his demonic heritage conferred the ability to fly through effort of will. Aliisza frowned, and followed behind him, spreading her black pinions wide to catch the blazing updrafts of the room. Kaanyr was still sore about Ched Nasad, and that was not good, she reflected. If the warlord ever tired of her, he was certainly capable of having her killed in some grisly manner, past intimacies notwithstanding. There was nothing of which he was not capable, if his temper got the better of him.\n The half-demon alighted beside a sand mold filling with molten iron. A pair of tanarukks stood by, carefully watching over the pour. Kaanyr squat-ted down by the white-hot metal and absently stirred his fingers in it. It was hot enough to cause him discomfort, and after a moment he shook the molten iron from his fingers and brushed them against his thigh.\n \"Good iron,\" he said to the tanarukks. \"Carry on, lads.\"\n He straightened and continued on his way. Aliisza fluttered to the stone floor and fell into step behind him.\n \"The thing that troubles me is this,\" Kaanyr mused. \"Why did the Xornbane duergar betray the House that employed them by burning the whole city? Was it simply a dispute over pay? Or did they intend from the start to bring ruin to Ched Nasad? If so, was Horgar Steelshadow behind it? Did the prince of Gracklstugh send his mercenaries to Ched Nasad to destroy the city, or did Clan Xornbane do that for someone else?\"\n \"Does it matter?\" Aliisza asked, sidling up beside him again. \"The city was destroyed, regardless of anyone\u0027s intentions. The great Houses of Ched Nasad are dead, and there aren\u0027t many Xornbane dwarves remaining, for that matter.\"\n \"It matters because I find myself wondering whether the duergar of Gracklstugh plan to attack Menzoberranzan next,\" Kaanyr said. \"I have amassed no small strength here, but I do not believe I can take Menzober-ranzan unless the dark elves are reduced to utter chaos and helplessness. If the duergar mean to march on the city too, my opportunities are limitless.\"\n \"Ah,\" Aliisza breathed. \"You could sell your services to the dark elves, the gray dwarves, both, or neither. Hmm, thatis interesting.\"\n \"And the price I command will increase with the number of warriors I bring, and my proximity to Menzoberranzan, but it depends on the in-tentions of the gray dwarves.\" The half-demon let out a bark of hard laughter. \"I would not care to find myself on Menzoberranzan\u0027s doorstep, facing a strong and united dark elf city with no allies at hand.\"\n \"Why do I get the feeling that you\u0027re about to send me away again?\" Aliisza pouted. She stretched her wings languorously around Kaanyr, halt-ing him as she reached up to turn him toward her. \"I\u0027ve only just come back, you know.\"\n \"Clever girl,\" Vhok said with a smile. \"Yes, I mean to dispatch you on another mission. This time, though, you won\u0027t have to creep about and stay out of sight. You will call on Horgar Steelshadow, the Crown Prince of Gracklstugh, as my personal envoy - a diplomat, if you like. Find out if the gray dwarves intend to attack Menzoberranzan. If they do, let them know that I would like to join them. If they don\u0027t . . . well, see if you can\u0027t persuade them that it\u0027s in their best interest to destroy Menzoberranzan while the dark elves are weak.\"\n \"The dwarves are not likely to confide in me.\"\n \"Of course they won\u0027t want to confide in you. However, if they do intend to attack, they will see the advantage of gaining me as an ally. If they don\u0027t plan on attacking, the fact that I am willing to ally with them may decide the issue for them. They wish Menzoberranzan no good, so you need not worry that they\u0027ll stand up for the drow.\"\n \"Envoy. ...\" Aliisza murmured. \"It sounds better than spy, doesn\u0027t it? I suppose I can carry your message for you, my sweet, fierce Kaanyr, but maybe you should provide me with some special incentive to hurry home, hmm?\"\n Kaanyr Vhok circled her with his powerful arms and nuzzled the hollow of her neck.\n \"Very well, my pet,\" he rumbled. \"Though I sometimes wonder if you are utterly insatiable.\"\n A desperate hour of flight from ruin to ruin saw the battered company to a hard-won refuge from the monsters who ruled Hlaungadath. Beneath the hulking shell of a square tower they found a sand-choked stair de-scending into cool, lightless catacombs beneath the city. Buoyed by their find, the dark elves slipped through a maze of buried shrines, subterranean wells, and echoing colonnades of brown stone, finally holing up in a deep, disused gallery that showed no signs of recent use. It was a cheerless and desolate spot, but it was free of blinding sunlight and mind-controlling monsters, and that was all they needed.\n \"Pharaun, prepare your spells quickly,\" Quenthel commanded after sizing up the chamber. \"Halisstra, you and Ryld will stand watch here. Jeg-gred, you and Valas keep watch on the far archway, over there.\"\n \"Unfortunately, you must keep your watch for some time,\" the wizard said. He made a rueful gesture. \"I was ready to study my spellbook earlier, when I\u0027d had some time to rest in the courtyard of the palace above, but the poor hospitality of our lamia hosts has left me somewhat fatigued. I must rest for some time before I will be able to ready my spells.\"\n \"We\u0027re all tired,\" Quenthel snarled. \"We have no time for you to rest. Prepare your spells at once!\"\n The snakes of her whip coiled and hissed in agitation.\n \"The exercise would be pointless, dear Quenthel. You must keep our enemies away from me until I have recovered from my exertions.\"\n \"If he is so powerless,\" Jeggred rumbled, \"now would be as good a time as any to punish him for his disrespectful attitude and many transgressions.\"\n \"Stupid creature,\" Pharaun snorted. \"Slay me, and all of you will die in these light-blasted wastelands within a day. Or perhaps you have sud-denly acquired a knack for the arcane arts?\"\n Jeggred bristled, but Quenthel silenced him with nothing more than a look. The draegloth stalked off to take up his watch at the far end of the long, dusty chamber, crouching in a jumble of fallen stones near the oppo-site entrance. Valas sighed and trotted off to join him.\n \"Ready your spells as fast as you can, wizard,\" the priestess said, deadly anger tightly contained in her voice. \"I have little patience left for your wit. Give Halisstra your lightning wand in case we need spells of that sort to repel another attack.\"\n It was a measure of his true exhaustion that Pharaun didn\u0027t even bother to seek the last word. He turned to Halisstra and dropped the black iron wand into her hand with a sour smile.\n \"I suppose you know how to use this already. I\u0027ll want it back, of course, so please try not to exhaust it completely. They\u0027re hard to make.\"\n \"I won\u0027t use it unless I have to,\" Halisstra said.\n She watched as the wizard found a shadowed spot beside a large column and sat down cross-legged, leaning against the cold stone, and she tucked the wand into her belt. Quenthel composed herself against the opposite wall, watching Pharaun as if to make sure he was not feigning his need for rest. Ryld Argith pushed himself erect and set out for the passage leading back toward the monster-haunted surface, leaning on his massive greatsword as he did so.\n Halisstra started to follow, but Danifae said, \"Shall I keep watch here, Mistress Melarn?\"\n The girl knelt on the dusty floor between the wizard and the priestess, the dagger thrust through her belt. She looked up at Halisstra, her expres-sion blank and perfect, the picture of an innocent question.\n The Melarn priestess repressed a grimace. Arming a battle captive was tantamount to admitting one no longer had the strength to force her submission, and she suspected that Danifae would later exact a difficult price for continued compliance. Danifae watched serenely as her mis-tress considered the offer. Halisstra could feel Quenthel\u0027s eyes on her too, and she steeled herself against glancing at the Baenre priestess to measure her approval.\n \"You may keep the dagger to defend yourself - for now,\" Halisstra allowed. \"Your vigilance is not required. Do not presume to suggest such a thing again.\"\n \"Of course, Mistress Melarn,\" Danifae replied.\n The girl\u0027s face was devoid of emotion, but Halisstra didn\u0027t like the thoughtful look in Danifae\u0027s eye as she composed herself to wait.\n Will her binding hold? Halisstra mused.\n In the heart of House Melarn, surrounded by the full strength of her enemies, Danifae would not have dared to throw off the magical com-pulsion that enslaved her, even if she could do such a thing. Things had changed, though. Danifae\u0027s care in how she addressed her mistress in front of Quenthel did not escape Halisstra\u0027s notice. Without her House, her city, to invest Halisstra with absolute dominion over what she called her own - her life, her loyalties, and possessions such as Danifae - any or all of those things might be wrested away from her. The thought left her feeling as hollow and as brittle as a rotten piece of bone.\n What happens when Danifae decides to test the bounds of her cap-tivity in earnest? she wondered. Would Quenthel permit Halisstra to retain her mastery over the girl, or would the Baenre intercede simply to spite Halisstra and strip her of one more shred of her status? For that matter, was Quenthel capable of freeing Danifae and claiming Halisstra herself as a battle captive?\n The girl studied Halisstra from her lowered eyes, demure andbeauti-ful. Patient.\n \"Are you coming?\" Ryld asked. He stood in the mouth of the passage, waiting.\n \"Yes, of course,\" Halisstra said, barely repressing a scowl.\n Deliberately turning her back on the servant, Halisstra followed Ryld back out to the tunnels leading to their refuge. For the moment, she was safe enough. Danifae could not remove the silver locket from her neck with all of her will, strength, and effort. The moment she touched it, the enchant-ment would lock her muscles into rigidity until she abandoned the attempt. Nor could she ask someone else to remove it for her, since the moment she tried to speak of the locket, her tongue would freeze in her mouth. As long as the locket encircled her neck, Danifae was compelled to serve Halisstra, even to the point of giving her own life to save her mistress. Danifae had borne her bondage well, but Halisstra had no intention of removing the locket in the presence of the Menzoberranyr - if, in fact, she ever did.\n She and Ryld took up positions in a small rotunda a short ways down the tunnel, a dark and open space from which they could keep the ap-proach to their refuge under careful observation without being seen them-selves. Folded in theirpiwafwis,they were virtually indistinguishable from the dark stone around them. Despite the capricious chaos and gnawing ambition that burned in every drow heart, any drow of accomplishment was capable of patience and iron discipline in the performance of an im-portant task, and so Halisstra and Ryld set themselves to watch and wait in vigilant silence.\n Halisstra tried to empty her mind of all but the input of her senses, to better stand her watch, but she found that her head was filled with thoughts that did not care to be dismissed. It occurred to Halisstra that whatever became of her from this day forward, she would rise or fall based on noth-ing more than her own strength, cunning, and ruthlessness. The displeasure of House Melarn meant nothing. If she desired respect, she would have to make the displeasure of Halisstra Melarn something to be feared in its place. All because Lolth had decided to test those most faithful to her. By the caprice of the goddess House Melarn of Ched Nasad, whose leading females for centuries beyond counting had poured out blood and treasure upon the Spider Queen\u0027s altars, had been cast down.\n Why? Halisstra wondered. Why?\n The answer was cold and empty, of course. Lolth\u0027s machinations were not for her priestesses to understand, and her tests could be cruel indeed. Halisstra ground her teeth softlyand tried to thrust her weak questions out of her heart. If Lolth chose to test Halisstra\u0027s faith by stripping her of every-thing she held dear to see if the First Daughter of House Melarn could win it back, the Spider Queen would find her equal to the challenge.\n Care to talk about it?Ryld\u0027s fingers flashed discretely in the sophisti-cated sign language of the dark elves.\n Talk about what?\n Whatever it is that troubles you. Something has you tied in a knot, priestess.\n It is nothing to concern a male, she replied.\n Of course. It never is.\n Their eyes met across the small chamber. Halisstra was surprised to find Ryld\u0027s face twisted in a curious expression of bitter resignation and wry amusement at the same time. She studied him carefully, trying to as-certain what motive he might have had for striking up a conversation.\n He was very tall and strongly built for a male - for any dark elf, really - just as tall as she was herself. His close-cropped hair was an exotic affecta-tion in drowsociety, a strangely ascetic austerity for a race that delighted in things of beauty and personal refinement. Drow were ruthlessly prag-matic in their dealings with one another, but not in their grooming. Most males in Halisstra\u0027s experience preened themselves, affecting silken grace and deadly guile. Pharaun virtually epitomized the type. Ryld, she realized, was something very different.\n You fight well, she offered - not an apology, not to a male, but still something. You could have let me die in Ched Nasad, yet you risked yourself to save me. Why?\n We had an agreement. You led us to safety, and we helped you escape.\n Yes, but I had discharged my end of the bargain by that time. There was no need to honor yours.\n There was no need not to.Ryld offered a slight smile, and shifted to a soft whisper. \"Besides, it seems that it was in my own interests to save you, as not an hour ago you saved my life in turn. We are indebted to each other.\"\n Halisstra laughed at that, so quietly that no one more than ten feet away would have noticed.\n We are not a race given to honoring our debts, she signed.\n That has been made clear to me more than once,the weapons master replied. A brief flicker of pain crossed his face, and Halisstra wondered exactly whom the Master of Melee-Magthere had trusted, and why he\u0027d done something so foolish. Before she could ask, he continued,So tell me of the bae\u0027qeshel.I do not know of them.\n \"By tradition,\" she whispered, \"our wizards, swordsmen, and clerics are trained in academies. This is true in most drow cities. The reason you do not know of thebae\u0027qeshel is that the bardic training is not a public matter. We pass our secrets, one mistress to one student at a time.\"\n I thought the noble Houses had little use for common minstrels.\n \"Thebae\u0027qeshel are not common minstrels, weapons master,\" Halis-stra said in a low voice. \"We are a proud and ancient sect, thebae\u0027qeshel telphraezzar, the Whisperers of the Dark Queen. I am a priestess of Lolth, as are the other females of my House, but I was chosen to spend many long years as a girl studying thebae\u0027qeshellore. I revere the goddess not only with my service as her priestess, but with the gift of raising the an-cient songs of our race, which are pleasing to her ears. House Melarn has always been proud to raise onebae\u0027qeshelinto the sisterhood of Lolth\u0027s service in each generation.\"\n \"If your songs are sacred to Lolth, why do they work while other spells fail?\" Ryld asked.\n \"Because the songs possess a power in and of themselves, like a wizard\u0027s spells. We do not channel the divine power of the Queen of Spiders to wield our songs. Regrettably, my skill with such things is nothing compared to the divine might I could wield in Lolth\u0027s name, if she would restore her favor to me.\"\n \"An interesting talent, nonetheless,\" he murmured. Ryld glanced back down the passageway toward the chamber where the others waited. \"It seems quiet enough. We may have some time to wait yet. If I know Pharaun, he will need hours to regain his strength. Tell me, do you playsava?\"\n Nimor clung to the shadows of a gigantic stalactite, one of many such stone fangs reaching down from the ceiling of Menzoberranzan\u0027s vast cavern. Old passages and precarious paths crisscrossed the city\u0027s roof, and many of the stalactites were in fact carved into darkly beautiful castles and aeries all the more spectacular for their bold arrogance. Only drow would make homes out of fragile stone spears a thousand feet above the cavern floor. Highborn dark elves frequently possessed innate magic or enchanted trinkets that freed them of concern over heights, and gave little thought to dizzying overlooks that would terrify bats. Their slaves and servants were not so fortunate, and must have found life in a ceiling spire something peculiarly nerve-racking.\n The more important ceiling spires were of course magically rein-forced against the inevitable fall, and would not fail unless magic itself gave out - but more than one proud old palace stood dusty and aban-doned at the top of the city, the House that claimed it too weak in the Art to maintain the spells that made the place tenable. It was in just such an empty place that Nimor crouched, leaning out over a dark abyss to study his target below.\n House Faen Tlabbar, Third House of Menzoberranzan, lay below him and a short distance to his left. The castle sprawled over several towering sta-lagmites and columns, its elegant balustrades and soaring buttresses belying the underlying strength of the rambling towers and mighty bulwarks of dark stone. Faen Tlabbar\u0027s compound was one of the largest and proudest of any in Menzoberranzan that did not sit on the high plateau of Qu\u0027ellarz\u0027orl, the most prestigious of the underground city\u0027s noble districts. Instead House Tlabbar\u0027s palace clambered up along the southern wall of Menzoberran-zan\u0027s great cavern, until its highest spires surmounted the plateau in whose shadow it sat, as if the matrons of the Third House wished to be able to peer over the plateau\u0027s edge and gaze enviously upon the manors fortunate enough to be located alongside the exalted House Baenre.\n It was an apt analogy for Faen Tlabbar\u0027s political maneuverings. Only two Houses stood ahead of them in Menzoberranzan\u0027s dark hierarchy: Baenre, the First, and BarrisonDel\u0027Armgo, the Second. Nimor thought it likely that Matron Mother Tlabbar harbored great aspirations for her House. Del\u0027Armgo, the Second House, was strong but with few allies. Baenre, the strongest, was as weak as it had been in centuries. Houses such as Faen Tlabbar gazed on the Baenre and remembered centuries of ab-solute arrogance, humiliating condescension, and they wondered whether the time had come for several lesser Houses to band together and end Baenre\u0027s dominance once and for all.\n \"That would be a merry game to watch,\" Nimor mused.\n He suspected that in such a scenario Baenre might prove stronger than their resentful rivals guessed, but the bloodletting would be spec-tacular. Several great Houses would fall, for Baenre would not go alone into the gentle night. Of course, that would go a long way toward ad-vancing the schemes of the Anointed Blade of the Jaezred Chaulssin.\n That would be a play for another day, though. Nimor meant to strike a deep and grievous blow at Faen Tlabbar, not incite them against House Baenre. Ghenni Tlabbar, Matron of the Third House, would die beneath his blade. Her blood would purchase treason on a grand scale, and place into the assassin\u0027s hand the stiletto Nimor meant to drive into Menzoberranzan\u0027s heart.\n A scrabbling sound and the clink of mail caught Nimor\u0027s notice. He withdrew softly into the shadows and waited patiently as a squad of Tlabbar warriors mounted on great riding lizards climbed along a small, unworked stalactite nearby. The pallid reptiles possessed large, sticky pads on their clawed feet that allowed them to cling to the sheerest of sur-faces, and many of Menzoberranzan\u0027s noble Houses used the creatures for patrolling the high places of the city\u0027s vast cavern. Faen Tlabbar was renowned for its squadrons of lizard cavalry. The assassin had studied the Tlabbar patrols from his precarious perch for more than an hour, care-fully timing their sweeps.\n Right on time, Nimor observed. You\u0027ve allowed yourselves to become predictable, lads.\n The riders carried crossbows and lances at the ready, scurrying along in single file as they looped around the smaller stalactite and scanned the cavern ceiling. As Nimor expected, the leader turned to the left and fol-lowed the curve of the stone pinnacle down and out of sight.\n \"You would do well to vary your routine, Captain,\" Nimor whispered to the departing squad. \"An intrepid fellow such as myself might be de-terred by the possibility of your unexpected return.\"\n With a single silent spring, Nimor launched himself out into the vast darkness, plunging through the eternal night.\n By an accident of cavern formation, House Tlabbar held little of the city\u0027s roof and overcaverns. One large column and a pair of small stalactites linked Tlabbar to the ceiling, which meant that Tlabbar had something of a blind spot directly over its palace roof. This was the weakness Nimor in-tended to exploit. His black cloak streamed behind him, and cold air rushed past his face. Nimor bared his teeth in a savage grin, delighting in the long seconds of his great leap. His body burned with the dark fires of his her-itage, and he longed to shed his rakish guise, but this was not the time.\n While he fell, he mouthed the words to a spell that made him in-visible, and as the spearlike pinnacle of Faen Tlabbar\u0027s central palace rushed up at him, he quickly halted his fall by employing his power of lev-itation. Less than six heartbeats from the moment he\u0027d leaped from the abandoned stalactite overhead, Nimor alighted on the knifelike ridge of a steep hall, invisible and undetected. He listened for any sign that he had been detected, then he glided toward the hall\u0027s juncture with the castle proper, his steps as silent as death.\n The dark elves of Faen Tlabbar were not unaware of their vulnerabil-ity to assault from above, and vigilant sentries manned battlements and cupolas atop the palace, watching for intruders. Nimor avoided them care-fully. Those who were able to see invisible foes - and there were more than a few - were not in the habit of watching for an invisible foe who also glided from shadow to shadow with the stealth of a master assassin. Nimor was more concerned with the various magical barriers shielding the house. He habitually protected himself with spells designed to counter and con-fuse various forms of magical detection, but they were not foolproof.\n Green and gold radiance glimmered around him as he crept along the steep,tiled roof of a square tower. The Faen Tlabbar, like many other Houses, used magic to illuminate and decorate the baroque spires and balconies of their home. Nimor lowered himself to his belly and edged down even farther, headfirst, listening carefully. Below him he expected to find a guard post, and an entrance leading into the manor itself. Over the decades the Jaezred Chaulssin had used magic to scry what they could of the layout and defenses of many great Houses in more than one drow city, and the slender assassin had carefully studied his brotherhood\u0027s notes and drawings on House Tlabbar. The information was, of course, incomplete and out of date, as parts of the castle were blocked from all scrying, and the Jaezred Chaulssin had not studied the Houses of Menzoberran-zan in a very long time. Nimor would have preferred to update his infor-mation through the bribery or capture of a Tlabbar guard, but he simply did not have the time to arrange such a thing and keep the rest of his timetable intact.\n He heard the soft sounds of movement on the balcony below the eave of the roof he lay on. Two, he guessed, at least one wearing chain mail. He would have to be swift - a single outcry could spell the end of his single-handed assault on the castle. With calculating patience, Nimor edged out even more and found himself looking down on a curving gallery beneath the overhanging eave. To his left, the walkway became a walled stair leading down to the lower battlements, while to his right it simply ended at a black doorway. The door itself stood open. Directly beneath him stood a drow male in armor, gazing out over a lower courtyard.\n Nimor studied the fellow for a full thirty heartbeats, planning his strike as he quietly slipped his dagger from its sheath. It was a blade of green-black enchanted steel that glistened wetly in the glimmering faerielight. Then, still invisible, he rolled himself off the roof and dropped down behind the Tlabbar guard.\n The assassin\u0027s feet thudded softly to the flagstones. The guard started to turn and opened his mouth to cry out, but with one remorseless move-ment, Nimor clapped a hand over the fellow\u0027s face and punched his dagger deep into the base of the skull. The blade grated on bone, and the Tlab-bar guard simply sagged into Nimor\u0027s arms, dead on his feet.\n Nimor let the nerveless body slump to the floor and looked up at the other sentry in the guard post, a fellow in the black robes of a wizard. The Tlabbar mage glanced over at the rustle of sound, just in time to see his watch mate fold up and collapse for no apparent cause - for Nimor was still invisible.\n \"Zilzmaer?\" he said sharply. \"What is it?\"\n Nimor bounded forward and rammed his bloody knife up under the wizard\u0027s chin, nailing his jaws closed and transfixing the Tlabbar\u0027s brain. The mage jerked two or three times, violently, then shuddered and died.\n \"Shh,\" the assassin hissed. \"It\u0027s nothing. Go to sleep.\"\n He laid the wizard alongside his companion, and turned to the dark archway leading into the castle proper.\n Knife in hand, he stalked through - only to be halted by an invisible, intangible barrier that blocked the archway as surely as a wall of masonry. Nimor frowned, summoned up his willpower, and tried the archway again, only to find his passage barred in mid-step.\n \"Damnation,\" he muttered. \"A forbidding.\"\n The Tlabbar castle, or its interior anyway, was warded by a great fixed spell that utterly prevented an enemy from setting foot within. Nimor could elude or undo some magical traps, but the forbidding was simply beyond his ability to penetrate.\n That explains the open door, he thought. The Tlabbars are confident in their magical defenses. Now what?\n Nimor sheathed his knife and studied the archway. A spell of forbid-ding could be crafted to defend a building or area in one of several ways, but if the Tlabbars wanted to move about their own castle, they would have had to make a forbidding through which one could pass without too much difficulty - perhaps with a token ofsomekind, or maybe with a password. Nimor quickly searched the bodies of the two Tlabbarguards he\u0027d slain, but found nothing that seemed like it might serve as a token to pass the forbidding.\n It might be anything, he thought. A cloak clasp, an enchanted coin in a purse, an earring or a necklace . . .\n He decided he didn\u0027t have time to experiment. With one hand he picked up the dead wizard and tucked the fellow under his arm, then he strode back to the archway and steeled himself to step through. This time, he passed through without resistance, as if the ward was simply gone.\n Something the Tlabbar guards wear, then, Nimor decided.\n He briefly considered shouldering the dead wizard and carrying the fellow along in case he needed to pass another warding inside the castle, but decided against it. Stealth and speed were his best defenses, and lug-ging a corpse through the castle was not particularly subtle. Besides, the Tlabbars were not likely to have two forbiddings in their palace, or to use the same key for both if they did. He unceremoniously dumped the wizard on the other side of the doorway, and headed inside.\n The archway opened into a long, high-ceilinged corridor that ran above one of the Tlabbar halls. Doors made of pale zurkhwood lined the hall, opening into studies, parlors, trophy rooms, and other such cham-bers if Nimor\u0027s old maps were correct. He ignored them all and darted swiftly down the hall, reaching a small staircase at the end that descendedto the level below. Here he encountered a magical glyph barring passage on the stair, but he sensed the trap before stepping close enough to trig-ger it. He simply vaulted over the rail instead, dropping lightly to the stairs below. The stairs swept around in a grand curve and led him to another gleaming black corridor near the center of the Tlabbar castle, leading to the House shrine. The floor was polished black marble that would have gleamed like a mirror had there been any light to see by. Not far ahead, a pair of House guards stood watch over a great double door leading into Lolth\u0027s sanctuary.\n Nimor smiled invisibly and congratulated himself on his timing. The matron mother, and perhaps a daughter or two, would be within, per-forming some empty ritual to their mute goddess.\n Carefully staying out of sight, Nimor took one more look around to make sure no one else was approaching. He studied the two guards out-side the door. They seemed no more than young officers, proudly attired for their exalted duty as guards to the matron mother, but Nimor did not trust his eyes. The two were more than they seemed,he was certain of it. He decided to bypass them if he could.\n Gathering himself, Nimor raised his left hand, on which gleamed a ring as black as jet. The ring of shadows was perhaps his most useful weapon, a device that conferred a number of useful magical powers. He called upon one of those powers, and melted into the shadows of the black corridor only to step out on the far side of the shrine\u0027s door, into House Tlabbar\u0027s most sacred sanctum.\n The temple almost filled the central floor of the great palace, its grace-ful dome rising overhead, chased in silver and jet with Lolth\u0027s spider in-signia. The shrine was lit with a sinister silvery radiance, the better to display the lavish wealth House Faen Tlabbar had expended in decorat-ing the Spider Queen\u0027s chapel. Nimor spared no admiration on the gold baubles and gem-encrusted images, though.\n Matron Mother Ghenni and two of her daughters abased themselves before the towering black idol of the silent goddess, groveling before Lolth, no doubt beseeching the Spider Queen to restore her favor to the House. No one else waited within. Apparently the matron mother felt that her guards and servants did not need to see her and her daughters prostrate themselves in their private adorations. Nimor\u0027s information on Faen Tlab-bar had once again been proven accurate.\n The assassin silently drew his rapier and advanced, eyeing his prey. Ghenni was a striking dark elf, a female with a voluptuous body and a sinuous grace that allowed her to carry her years better than many fe-males a hundred years younger. He noted the dark glint of mail beneath her emerald robes, and smiled. Apparently even the matron mother of a strong House didn\u0027t feel entirely safe in her own home without the Spider Queen\u0027s protection.\n The matron mother paused in her observances, warned by something - a small sound, theflicker of a shadow, possibly just intuition. She raised herself up to her knees and looked around, wariness plain on her face.\n \"Sil\u0027zet, Vadalma,\" she hissed. \"We are not alone.\"\n The two girls halted at once, still stretched out on the cold stone floor. They glanced about warily. Ghenni stood carefully, reaching for a wand at her belt.\n \"Who are you?\" she demanded. \"Who dares intrude on our devotions?\"\n Nimor made no answer but glided closer. The matron mother didn\u0027t see him, he was certain of that, but just as he drew within sword reach, he felt apresence coalesce in the room. An unseen demonic force took shape in the air near the top of the dome.\n \"Beware, Matron,\" a cold voice hissed. \"An assassin approaches you unseen.\"\n To her credit, the Matron Mother of House Faen Tlabbar did not quail. As her daughters scrambled to their feet, Ghenni took two steps back and quickly gestured with her wand, snapping out a word of command. A sphere of roiling blackness hurled forth from the wand and burst behind Nimor in an inky blot of frigid shadows that lashed out like living things hungry for prey. The assassin ignored the spell, as he was already leaping forward. With a precise thrust, he ran the Faen Tlabbar through with his rapier. The blade was as black as night, a long stiletto of intangible shadowstuff that simply glided through the matron mother\u0027s mail shirt as if the armor wasn\u0027t even there. Its effect on the priestess was as lethal as one might expect. He twisted the blade in her heart and grinned, though she still could not see him.\n \"Greetings, Matron Mother,\" he hissed aloud. \"Perhaps you will find the answers you were seeking when you reach Lolth\u0027s black hells.\"\n Ghenni gasped once and coughed blood. She staggered back, clutch-ing at the blade in her heart, and her eyes rolled up in her head and she toppled to the floor. Nimor withdrew his rapier and whirled on the daugh-ter on the left, Sil\u0027zet, while the demon took shape over Ghenni\u0027s body. It was a skeletal creature wrapped in green flames, armed with a black-glowing scimitar of pale bone.\n The demon evidently could see him perfectly, for it set on Nimor at once. It aimed a ferocious cut at his head, which he simply ducked, but the creature reversed its blade with surprising speed and back-handed a second cut waist high. Nimor scowled and skipped back, mo-mentarily thwarted. Behind the demon, he saw Sil\u0027zet unrolling a scroll to read, while Vadalma held her ground, stooping to retrieve her mother\u0027s wand while guarding herself with a dagger.\n \"You will not escape this room with your life, assassin,\" Vadalma cried. \"Guards! To me!\"\n Nimor heard the guards outside fumbling at the chapel door. He ducked and darted, keeping away from the bone demon, but unwilling to engage it. Slaying a guardian demon was pointless, after all. He had only a few mo-ments more, and he wanted to make the most of them. The assassin took one quick step and rolled beneath the demon\u0027s guard, coming up beside Sil\u0027zet as she declaimed the words of her scroll. He rammed his dagger into the small of her back while parrying the bone demon\u0027s scimitar with his own black rapier. Sil\u0027zet shrieked in agony and wrenchedaway, but Nimor tripped her expertly. She sprawled to the ground and writhed. Nimor followed her and sank the point of his rapier into the notch of her collarbone.\n This time, the demon made him pay for ignoring it. Screeching in rage, it flailed at him with its bone sword, cutting a long, burning gash across his shoulder blade as he tried to spin out of the way. Nimor gritted his teeth against the pain and rolled away before the creature could cut him in two.\n Vadalma barked out the command word for her mother\u0027s wand and blasted blindly with the shadow sphere in Nimor\u0027s direction, flaying the assassin\u0027s flesh with ebon tendrils as cold and as sharp as razors.\n The door guards burst in with blades bared, their faces cold and ex-pressionless. They closed with uncanny swiftness, sword points weaving as they groped closerto Nimor, following him with quick jerks of their heads as if the scuffle of his boots and panting of hisbreath betrayed him.\n I\u0027ve done what I came for, Nimor decided.\n Ghenni was dead, and Sil\u0027zet clearly dying. Her heels drummed on the marble floor as she drowned in her own blood. He would have liked to have killed Vadalma as well, but the demon and the door guards - whatever they actually were - simply complicated matters beyond prac-tical resolution.\n With a grimace of resignation, Nimor backed off several steps and blinked away with the power of his ring, emerging an instant later near the balcony where he had first entered the castle. The forbidding kept him from escaping in a single dimensional leap, but the assassin simply seized the body of the Tlabbar wizard he\u0027d left by the door and darted outside again. The cut across his shoulders burned abominably, and his legs ached where the icy tendrils of the sphere had lashed him, but Nimor drew in a deep breath and allowed himself a feral grin of triumph.\n \"Fortunate fellows,\" he said to the dead males at his feet. \"When the Tlabbars determine that you guarded the door through which I came, you will be glad that you are dead.\"\n The bodies made no response, of course. They never did.\n He glanced out at the faerielight glimmering over the battlements of the castle, listening to the alarms and cries of dismay rising from within. He would have liked to savor the sounds for a long time, but pursuit could not be far behind. With a sigh, he clenched his fist around his black ring and willed himself away. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/condemnation-war-of-the-spider-queen-3/page-4.html","bookId":2161,"book":{"id":2161,"title":"Condemnation (War of the Spider Queen #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Condemnation (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
