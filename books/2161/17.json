{"id":97478,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Within a day of Seyll\u0027s murder, Halisstra began to wonder if she might have been better off going with the Eilistraee priestess and feigning conversion. It might have been a strategy unlikely to reunite her with her comrades, but it would have meant that she would have enjoyed shelter, food, and the opportunity to perhaps regain her equipment, in-stead of an interminable march through the freezing woods. As dawn approached, she could find no better shelter than a small, damp hollow surrounded by drow-high boulders and bare trees. Shivering, she shrugged off her stolen backpack and searched it thoroughly, hoping against hope that she had somehow overlooked some key implement or a scrap of food. Seyll and her followers had not anticipated a wilderness sojourn of more than a few hours. They carried no more gear than Halisstra would have, had she decided to venture out to a well-known cavern a mile or two from Ched Nasad. They certainly hadn\u0027t equipped themselves for the convenience of their captive\u0027s escape. With the crossbow she\u0027d taken from Xarra and thebae\u0027qeshelsongs at her command, she had a fair chance of dropping any game she came across, but in her hours and hours of wandering she\u0027d not seen anything larger than a bird. Even if she did succeed in killing something for her dinner, she had no means to cook it, and Halisstra was beginning to sus-pect that the forest itself conspired against her. She was reasonably sure that she\u0027d managed to keep heading west after her escape from the heretic. If Seyll hadn\u0027t been lying when she said they were near the spot where Halisstra had been captured, the Melarn priestess was no more than one or two nights\u0027 march from the small river Pharaun had described in his vision. Since the river ran south to north somewhere in front of her, it seemed a difficult target to miss as long as she kept moving west. Halisstra tried to keep the sunset and moonset ahead of her, and a little to her left, since they\u0027d be somewhat south of her at this time of year - or so she\u0027d gathered from watching Valas navigate the woods over the past few days. Of course, she had no way of knowing whether to turn upstream or downstream when she did reach Pharaun\u0027s river, since she couldn\u0027t be sure that she\u0027d struck the stream at the spot the wizard antici-pated. For that matter, she was unlikely to know for certain whether she\u0027d found the right stream at all. She\u0027d already crossed a dozen small brooks in a day and a half, and while she didn\u0027t think any of them could prop-erly be called a river, she simply didn\u0027t have enough experience of the sur-face world to be sure. \"Of course, that all presumes that I haven\u0027t been wandering in circles for hours,\" Halisstra muttered. It could be that the most sensible thing to do would be to abandon the notion of searching for the Jaelre, and pick the straightest course out of the forest she could find. Sooner or later, she might find civilization again, and beg, borrow, or steal food and other supplies - or charm a guide who could lead her to the Jaelre. She closed her eyes, trying to build a mental picture of Cormanthor and the lands around it. She was in the eastern part of the forest, she knew - so was her best course east, toward the rising sun? There was little on that side of the forest except for the human settlement of Harrowdale. if she recalled her geography. Or was she better off turning south? Severalmore dales lay in that direction, so her odds of reaching civilization seemed better that way, even if that meant she would have a longer trek to reach the eaves of the forest. North she ruled out at once, since she was fairly certain that Elventree lay in that direction. Any way she went, she would be turning her back on the Jaelre and her sacred mission, at least for a time. \"This would be easier if the goddess would consent to answer my prayers,\" she grumbled. When she realized what she\u0027d said, she couldn\u0027t help but glance around and put a hand to her mouth. Lolth did not look kindly on complainers. She passed a cold, wet, and miserable day hunched down among the rocks of her small hiding place, drifting in and out of Reverie. More than once she wished she\u0027d had the presence of mind to order Feliane to guide her to the Jaelre, or at least give up her cloak and pack before dashing off in a panic. Lord Dessaer\u0027s rangers were most likely on her trail, of course, and they would not show her much mercy if she fell into their hands again. Even so, Halisstra was beginning to feel that a quick execution by the surface elves might be preferable to a long and lonely death by starva-tion in the endless forest. At nightfall she rose, gathered her belongings, and scrambled out of her hiding place. She stood on the forest floor, looking toward the di-rection she reckoned west, then south, and west again. South might offer a better chance of finding a human or surface elf settlement, but she couldn\u0027t bring herself to abandon the hope of rejoining her comrades. Better to try one more march west, and if she still hadn\u0027t found Pharaun\u0027s river by dawn, she\u0027d think about giving up the effort. \"West, then,\" she said to herself. She walked for a couple of hours, trying to keep the moon left of her, even though she felt it rather than saw it. The night was cold, and high thin clouds scudded by overhead, driven by a fierce blast of wind that didn\u0027t reach down to the shelter of the trees. The woods were cold and still, probably pitch black by a surface dweller\u0027s standards, but Halisstra found that the diffuse moonlight flooded the forest like a sea of gleaming silver shadow. She paused to study the sky, trying to gauge whether she was al-lowing the moon\u0027s passage to affect her course too much, when she heard the faint sound of rushing water. Carefully she stole forward, trotting softly through the night, and she emerged at the bank of a wide, shallow brook that splashed over a pebbly bed. It was wider than any she\u0027d seen yet, easily thirty to forty feet, and it ran from her left to her right. \"Is this it?\" she breathed. It seemed large enough, and it was about where she\u0027d expected to find it - a march and a half from the place where she\u0027d been captured. Halis-stra crouched and studied the swift water, thinking. If she made the wrong decision, she might follow the stream into some desolate and unpopulated portion of the woods and die a lonely death of hunger and cold. Then again, her prospects weren\u0027t very bright no matter what she did. Halisstra snorted to herself, and followed the stream to her left. What did she have to lose? She managed another mile or so before the night\u0027s walk and the cold air made her hunger too great to be borne any longer, and she resolved to stop and make a midnight meal of whatever supplies she had left. Halis-stra shook her pack off her shoulder and started to look around when an odd whirring sound fluttered through the air. Without even thinking about it, Halisstra threw herself flat on the ground - she knew the sound too well. Two small quarrels flew past her, one sinking into a nearby tree trunk, the other glancing from her armored sleeve. Halisstra rolled behind the tree and quickly sang a spell of invisibility, hoping to throw off her assail-ants\u0027 aim, when she happened to glance again at the bolt. It was small and black, with red fletching; the bolt of a drow hand crossbow. Several stealthy attackers moved closer through the wood, their pres-ence indicated only by the occasional rustle of leaves on the ground or a low signaling whistle. Halisstra carefully stood, still hiding behind the tree. In a low voice she called, \"Hold your fire. I killed the Eilistraeen priestess who carried these arms. I serve the Spider Queen.\" Her voice carried the hint of abae\u0027qeshelsong that gave her words an undeniable sincerity. Several drow stalked closer, their feet rustling softly in the underbrush. Halisstra caught sight of them, furtive males in green and black who prowled through the moonlit forest like panthers. They peered into the darkness, searching for her, but her spell concealed her well enough. She set her hand to the hilt of Seyll\u0027s sword and shifted slightly to ready her shield in case they found a way to defeat her invisibility. One of the drow in front of her paused a moment and replied, \"We\u0027ve been looking for you.\" \"Looking for me?\" Halisstra said. \"I seek an audience with Tzirik. Can you take me to him?\" The Jaelre warriors halted. Their fingers flashed quickly, signing to each other. After a moment, the warrior who had spoken straightened and lowered his crossbow. \"Your company of spider-kissers came to Minauthkeep three days ago,\" he said. \"You were separated from them?\" Hoping that Quenthel and the others had done nothing to make en-emies of the Jaelre, Halisstra decided to answer honestly. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Very well, then,\" the stranger replied. \"High Priest Tzirik ordered us to find you, so we\u0027ll take you back. Why, and what becomes of you there, is up to him.\" Halisstra allowed her invisibility to fade, and nodded. The Jaelre drow fell in around her and set off at a quick pace toward the south, following the stream. She might have had no idea where she was, but the Jaelre seemed to know the woods well enough. In less than an hour, they came to a ruined keep, its white walls gleaming in the moonlight. The stream passed a stone\u0027s throw from the fortress. I had the right stream, Halisstra noted with some surprise. She\u0027d kept her course for two nights and veered only a couple of miles too far to her right, it seemed. She thought about what would have happened if she\u0027d crossed the stream and continued. The thought made her shiver. The Jaelre scouts led Halisstra into the ruined keep, past watchful guards who crouched in hidden places and kept an eye on the forest all around. She discovered that the place was in much better repair than it seemed from outside. Her guards escorted her to a modest hall whose only furnishings were a large fire and an array of hunting trophies, mostly sur-face creatures Halisstra did not recognize. She waited for a long time, growing hungrier and thirstier, but eventually a short, solidly built male of middle years appeared, his face covered in a ceremonial black veil. \"Lucky me,\" he said in a rich voice. \"Twice in three days servants of the Spider Queen have called upon my home and asked for me by name. I begin to wonder if Lolth wishes me to reconsider my devotion to the Masked Lord.\" \"You are Tzirik?\" Halisstra asked. \"I am he,\" the priest said, folding his arms and studying her. \"And you must be Halisstra.\" \"I am Halisstra Melarn, First Daughter of House Melarn, Second House of Ched Nasad. I understand that my companions are here.\" \"Indeed they are,\" Tzirik said. He offered a cold smile. \"One thing ata time, though. I see you wear the arms of a priestess of Eilistraee. How did you come by them?\" \"As I told your warriors, my company was attacked by surface elves some distance away from here five days ago. My companions escaped the attack, but I was captured and taken to a place called Elventree. There, a female who called herself Seyll Auzkovyn called on me in my cell, and sought to indoctrinate me in the ways of Eilistraee.\" \"A rather simpleminded notion,\" Tzirik observed. \"Continue, please.\" \"I allowed her to believe I might be swayed,\" Halisstra said. \"She of-fered to take me to a rite they were to hold two nights ago out in the forest. I found an opportunity to escape as we traveled to their ceremony.\" She glanced down at the mail and weapons she wore. The naivete of the female still surprised Halisstra. Seyll had not seemed like a stupid drow, not by any stretch of the imagination, and yet she had fatally mis-judged Halisstra. \"In any event,\" she finished, \"I took the liberty of borrowing some things Seyll had no more use for, since the good people of Elventree con-fiscated my own weapons and armor.\" \"And now you would like to be reunited with your comrades?\" \"Provided they\u0027re not dead or imprisoned, yes,\" she replied. \"Nothing like that,\" said the priest. \"They asked me to provide an unusual service for them, so I thought of something they could do for me by way of compensation for my time and trouble. If they succeed, they should return in a day or two. The question is, will you be here to greet them?\" Halisstra narrowed her eyes and remained silent. The high priest paced over by the fire and took a poker from a stand by the hearth. He prodded at the crackling logs. \"The comrades who abandoned you to captivity among the surface folk told me a very unusual story,\" said the priest. \"Doubtless you\u0027re think-ing to yourself, \u0027How can I know how much they told Tzirik?\u0027 You can\u0027t, of course, so the wisest thing to do would be to tell me everything.\" \"My companions may not appreciate that when they return,\" Halis-stra said. \"Your companions will never know you were here if you fail to sat-isfy my curiosity, Mistress Melarn,\" Tzirik said. He set down the poker, and lowered himself into a seat by the fire. \"Now, why don\u0027t you start at the beginning?\" Ryld crouched in the thick embrace of a deadly, acidic fog, trying hard not to draw breath despite the fact that he panted for air. His skin burned as if liquid fire had been poured over his body, and ugly welts were already rising wherever his ebon skin was exposed to the air. To stay where he was invited nothing less than a slow, agonizing death, but the vapors clung to his limbs like soft white hands, impeding his every movement. The cursed beholder lurked somewhere in the chamber, but where? A brilliant bolt of lightning illuminated the white murk, lashing out with a dozen crackling arcs as it plowed through the mist. The weapons master threw himself aside and fell slowly to the floor, cushioned by the clinging mists, as a mighty thunderclap shook the stones of the chamber and rattled his teeth in his head. \"Pharaun!\" he shouted. \"Where is the damned - ?\" He instantly regretted speaking, as needles of hot pain filled his nose and throat. \"Against the east wall!\" the wizard replied from some distance away. The Master of Sorcere fell at once into another spell, rushing his words as he tried to cast as quickly as possible. Meanwhile the beholder mage droned its horrid spell-song, muttering the black words of half a dozen in-cantations at once. Lightning flashed again, followed by the whining shrieks of conjured missiles arrowing for their targets, and the cries, shouts, and curses of his companions. Ryld finally reached the floor, where he found himself fetched up against one curving stone wall - the only landmark he could make out in the horrible mist. Without pausing for thought, he scrabbled forward at the best speed he could, hoping to emerge from the acidic fog before it burned the flesh from his face. Goddess, what a mess! he thought, slashing and cleaving at the thick tendrils of fog with Splitter. The beholder had been waiting for them to resort to magic to ascend the shaft, and it had scoured the company with every spell at its command. \"The devils are coming up after us!\" Jezz shouted from somewhere beyond the burning fog. \"Finish this thing quickly so that we can get what we came for and leave!\" Finish it quickly, Ryld thought with a grimace. That\u0027s a novel idea. He surged forward and suddenly found himself free of the deadly, clinging fog. No one else stood nearby, though he could hear his compan-ions battling in the mists behind him. \"Damnation!\" he muttered. Clear of the unnatural fog, it was apparent that the whole floor of the tower had once been a royally appointed suite of rooms. A thick red haze of dust on the floor might have once been a plush carpet, and the walls were finished in patterns of orange and gold tile to form the image of a surface forest with its normally green leaves for some reason rendered in reds, oranges, and yellows. Ryld coughed, his eyes streaming from contact with the noxious fumes. Evidently he\u0027d blundered through an archway into a differ-ent chamber, but another doorway led out of the room on the far side. \"Where in all the screaming hells am I?\" Something screeched in rage ahead, and the room beyond the arch flared brightly with magical fire. Ryld hefted Splitter and dashed into the next room, right into the middle of a fierce skirmish. Danifae and Jezz battled against a pair of lean, scaly devils almost ten feet tall, horrible fiends with huge wings who fought with razor-sharp scourges and barbed tails that dripped with green venom. Several lesser devils hissed and surged behind the two already in the room, pressing for-ward and looking for a chance to join the fight. \"The devils are upon us!\" Jezz cried. The Jaelre fought with a curved knife in one hand, and a deadly white spell-flame wreathing the other. One of the big devils sprang at Jezz and hammered its iron chains past the Jaelre\u0027s defenses, spinning the surface drow to the floor. The creature stooped over the dazed Jaelre and reached for his throat. Ryld glided forward, feinted high to bring the devil\u0027s weapon up to guard its face, and crouched low to take off its leg at the knee. The huge fiend roared in pain and toppled, its wings fluttering awkwardly as black blood spurted from the horrible wound. Ryld moved in close and reversed his grip on Splitter to finish the monster on the ground, but it replied with a flurry of slashing claws and snapping teeth, while lashing its barbed tail at him so quickly that only the stoutness of his dwarven breastplate saved him from being spitted on the wounded devil\u0027s sting. Ryld parried furiously, battling for his life, as yet moredevils - a group composed of man-sized creatures who were armed with knifelike barbs jutting from their scaly bodies - swarmed closer, their fanged faces twisted in hellish glee. \"Dark elves to feast on!\" they gloated. \"Drow hearts to eat!\" \"We\u0027ve got to get out of here!\" Danifae cried. \"We can\u0027t hold them!\" She whirled her morningstar with skill and strength, dueling the other big devil and a pair of the smaller ones whosnatched at her from her flanks. \"There\u0027s no place to go,\" Ryld snapped. \"The beholder\u0027s behind us!\" He could feel deadly spells flying in the chamber behind him, the re-verberations of thunderbolts and the soul-searing chill of slaying spells that made his flesh crawl. This isn\u0027t working, he thought. We\u0027re split in two, fighting two dan-gerous enemies. They needed to regroup and focus on one foe or the other, or aban-don the field all together and try again later. Presuming, of course, that the denizens of Myth Drannor allowed them to retreat at all. More than likely, they\u0027d all die here, surrounded and overwhelmed by endless hordes of blood-thirsty demons. Quenthel and Valas were likely dead already. Enough, Ryld snarled to himself. We didn\u0027t come all this way to be defeated here! He redoubled his attack, stepped inside the big devil\u0027s reach, and drove Splitters point through the creature\u0027s scaly neck. It flailed violently at him, but it was dying, and its convulsions gouged stone and clawed at the air in-stead of mauling Ryld. The weapons master leaped over the creature\u0027s body to engage the smaller barbed devils already moving toward him. Jezz rejoined the fray, pulling out a scroll from his belt and hurriedly reading off an abjuration that blasted several of the lesser devils back to whatever infernal realm they had crawled out of. Two more instantly replaced their banished comrades. \"We have to move!\" the Jaelre cried. \"The beholder is our enemy. The devils are just a distraction!\" Ryld grimaced again. If they tried to flee, they\u0027d be pulled down from behind. Still, he started backing his way toward the door leading to the beholder, praying that the creature was not in a position to see them. He gave ground grudgingly, unwilling to blunder into another fight while one still raged. To his surprise, one of the devils on the other side of the chamber dropped out of view, and another one shrieked as a serpent-headed scourge sank its fangs into the back of its neck. Struggling through the ranks of the devils, Valas and Quenthel limped into sight. The scout supported the badly injured priestess, warding her side with one of his kukris while she lashed and flailed with her deadly scourge. Danifae and Ryld took advantage of the devils\u0027 momentary disadvan-tage to press home attacks against their immediate foes. Quenthel slumped to one wall, fumbling with Halisstra\u0027s healing wand at her side, while Valas drew his second knife and darted into the fray, slashing and stabbing the devils from behind. \"Hurry!\" Quenthel gasped. \"A pit fiend and a dozen more devils are just behind us.\" Ryld cut down another of the barbed devils, while Danifae splattered the brains of a second across the chamber wall with a two-handed blow of her morningstar. In the space of a few moments, the dark elves cleared the room of devils. Jezz produced another scroll and quickly read off a spell, sealing the doorway behind Quenthel and Valas with a crackling sheet of sparking yellow energy. \"That will only hold the creature for a moment,\" he cautioned. The Baenre looked around the chamber. The fall in the shaft must have hurt her badly. Blood caked the side of her head, and her eyes didn\u0027t seem to want to focus. One arm hung limp at her side, but she held her-self upright. \"Where\u0027s the beholder,\" she asked, \"Pharaun, and Jeggred?\" Ryld jerked his head at the archway behind him. Another spell rumbled through the air. \"Back there somewhere,\" he said. \"The beholder - \" He was interrupted by the sudden, sickening awareness of an over-whelming presence approaching Jezz\u0027s barrier, something unseen that seemed to shake the very stones of the tower with its footfalls. \"The pit fiend comes,\" Danifae reported, panting for breath, her eyes wide with alarm. \"Go,\" Quenthel said, waving them forward with her good arm. Without another word, the dark elves scrambled for the other exit, plunging into the next room heedless of the spells that thundered and crawled in the space beyond. Triel Baenre stood on a high bridge of House Baenre, gazing toward Narbondel. The creeping ring of radiance that slowly climbed the mighty stone column marked the passage of time in Menzoberranzan. The glow stood near the pillar\u0027s upper end, which meant that the day would soon be done. Not for the first time it struck her as ironic that a race that had been driven from the world of light almost ten thousand years in the past would have the slightest use for marking the passage of days and nights in the manner of the surface folk, when the night was eternaland changeless in the Underdark, but it had proven somewhat useful over the years to re-member the endless march of unseen days in the world above. It helped in dealing with those who had more use for the custom, such as merchants who brought a few of the surface\u0027s more exotic and desirable goods down to the City of the Spider Queen. Not that many of those had visited Menzoberranzan of late. War was hard on commerce. The other question that came to Triel\u0027s mind as she looked out over Narbondel and the city below was somewhat less abstract: Who would be coming in an hour or two to cast the spells that renewed Narbondel\u0027s fiery ring? The office of archmage still belonged to her brother Gromph, miss-ing for more than a tenday, but the Masters of Sorcere would not permit the high seat to remain empty for much longer. She\u0027d learned that several of the more ambitious masters already maneuvered for the post. Doubtless Pharaun Mizzrym would have been among them if he had remained in the city, but the errand to Ched Nasad had fortunately removed the hero of the hour from Menzoberranzan at the very moment that he might have put his fame to its best use. She turned her head slightly and spoke over her shoulder to the loyal Baenre guards who stood a respectful distance behind her. \"Send for Nauzhror,\" she said. \"Tell him I desire his counsel on a matter of some importance. He may attend me in the chapel.\" Triel made her way to the great temple of Lolth that lay in the center of House Baenre\u0027s Great Mound, her attention far from her surroundings as she contemplated the multiplicity of troubles that had descended over the city in the past few months. She was almost grateful to the duergar for providing her with a cause to which she could rally the Council, and through them the dozens of lesser Houses that comprised Menzoberran-zan\u0027s strength. A victory in the tunnels south of the city would do much to restore House Baenre\u0027s preeminence. On the other hand, another setback could be disastrous. Even if Baenre remained the wealthiest and most powerful House, the Council might see fit to remove House Baenre as the First House. None of them alone, per-haps not even any two of them together, could hope to defeat House Baenre, but what if all seven of the other Houses on the Council agreed that it was time to pull down the strongest among them? \"Lolth preserve us,\" Triel muttered, and shivered with true fear. In terms of numbers of troops, magical might, and sheer wealth, the other Houses had always possessed the wherewithal to destroy House Baenre if they chose to unite against the First House. What they had never possessed was the blessing of the goddess for an act of such impropriety. If the Spider Queen returned her attention to Menzoberranzan and de-stroyed the Second through the Eighth Houses for their presumption the day after they obliterated House Baenre, well, Baenre would hardly be helped by it. Without Lolth\u0027s wrath to deter the ambitions of the other great Houses, a unified attack against Baenre seemed more like an inevitability than a possibility. The trick, mused Triel, is to keep the other Houses from settling thorny issues such as who would be First House after Baenre\u0027s fall, and tempt some of the smaller Houses with the places of the larger ones. If Houses such as Xorlarrin or Agrach Dyrr could be convinced that they would advance with more certainty by supporting Baenre against a conspiracy of Barrison Del\u0027Armgo and Faen Tlabbar than they would by turning against the First House, then House Baenre could withstand almost any threat from its lesser neighbors. She paused at the door to the chapel, examining the notion with acute distaste. Could she really feel that House Baenre neededallies?The old Matron Baenre had not governed with anyone\u0027s consent. She had ruled the city because she was so strong no one could contemplate resisting her will. Triel scowled and gestured at the chapel guards, who pulled open the doors and bowed before her. Her sister Sos\u0027Umptu awaited her in the chapel. Sos\u0027Umptu had Quenthel\u0027s height, but took after Triel\u0027s thoughtful reserve as opposed to the willfulness of Quenthel or her unlamented sister Bladen\u0027Kerst. Sos\u0027Umptu possessed a calculated, deliberate maliciousness that she kept in careful check, never picking a feud she could not win. She briefly low-ered her eyes, the minimal gesture of respect Triel\u0027s position demanded, then straightened. \"Any news from the army, eldest sister?\" she asked in a soft voice. \"Not as yet. Zal\u0027therra tells me that Mez\u0027Barris has dispatched a small force to go ahead and seize a strategic pass in the path of the duergar army, which seems sensible enough. The rest of the Army of the Black Spider follows as fast as it may.\" \"It is a difficult situation. I wonder if perhaps you should have led the army in person.\" Triel frowned. She was not accustomed to having her actions openly scrutinized by anyone, but if she couldn\u0027t survive the criticism of her family, how could she hope to cow the other matrons? \"Given the unusual situation,\" Triel replied, \"I felt it wisest to remain close to the city.\" \"Perhaps. The problem is simple, of course - if the army is defeated, the blame will naturally attach to you. If the army triumphs, you have made a hero of Mez\u0027Barris Del\u0027Armgo.\" \"As well as Zal\u0027therra and Andzrel,\" Triel pointed out. \"I admit I have more to lose than to gain, but I will not second-guess myself now.\" She studied the chapel, gazing up at the great magical image depict-ing the Queen of Spiders. While Sos\u0027Umptu watched, Triel performed a perfunctory obeisance. \"You have not observed the goddess\u0027s rites as closely as you might over the last few tendays,\" Sos\u0027Umptu said. The goddess has not observed us for far longer, Triel found herself thinking. She hurriedly thrust the blasphemous thought from her mind, horri-fied that something so irreverent could ferment in her head. She main-tained her outward calm with the ease of long practice, returning her attention to her sister. \"We are confronted by yet another challenge,\" Triel said. \"The Masters of Sorcere clamor for Gromph\u0027s replacement. House Baenre has placed archmages on Sorcere\u0027s throne as we liked for many hundreds of years, but this time, I am weighing the value of supporting the candidate of another House for the position. It might be ... expedient.\" Sos\u0027Umptu\u0027s eyes widened by the thickness of a blade, and she said, \"You seek my counsel?\" \"As Gromph has absented himself, and Quenthel is far away, I find that the children of my formidable mother are in short supply. Very few females - and even fewer males - understand the lessons Mother taught us.\" Triel snorted in irritation. \"Not even all our siblings, for that matter. Bladen\u0027Kerst understood nothing but strength and cruelty, and Vendes was simply murderous. I have need of a sharp mind, a subtle mind, trained by my mother, and it occurs to me that I have allowed you to lurk in this chapel far too long.\" Triel moved a half-step closer and hardened her ex-pression. \"Understand that you advise me at my pleasure, and do not mis-take consideration for indecision. I will brook no questioning of my right to rule.\" Sos\u0027Umptu nodded and said, \"Very well. I think we should presume that Gromph has been killed. He would not have lightly abandoned his duties, and there are at least two reasons someone might have killed him. Either someone wanted to strike against the archmage himself, or some-one wanted to strike against the leading wizard of House Baenre. If the former, well, whomever becomes archmage next will either be the culprit, or the next target. Why should we hurry to place a Baenre wizard weaker than Gromph into that position, when there is at least some chance we might lose whomever we promote?\" \"I don\u0027t like the idea of surrendering such an important post to an-other family, but I like the idea of losing another skilled wizard even less,\" Triel mused. \"Especially when we might forge a stronger tie with another House by allowing them to advance their candidate, who would then become the target of whatever power was strong enough to destroy Gromph.\" \"I don\u0027t understand,\" Sos\u0027Umptu replied. \"You seekallies? \" \"It occurs to me that we might do well to ally ourselves with a great House of middle rank, perhaps two,\" said Triel. \"It seems a sound precau-tion against any effort by the Second or Third Houses to rally the rest in common cause against us.\" Sos\u0027Umptu stroked her chin and said, \"You believe matters have become as dangerous as that? Mother would never have agreed to such a thing.\" \"Mother lived in a different time,\" Triel said. \"Do not compare me to her again.\" Triel fixed her eyes on her sister until the priestess dropped her gaze. Sos\u0027Umptu was clever, but not strong. If she joined forces with Quen-thel, or maybe a cabal of the more capable cousins such as Zal\u0027therra, she would be a threat to Triel, but until then she could be trusted - within reason. \"What if Gromph\u0027s assassination was an attack on House Baenre,\" Triel asked, \"and not simply a means to open the post of archmage?\" \"In that case, we would be well advised to raise another Baenre wizard over Sorcere. Failing to do so would make us seem weak, and if the other Houses perceive us as vulnerable, they might be tempted to try the very thing you fear.\" \"Your advice does not provide me much comfort, Sos\u0027Umptu,\" Triel grated. \"And I am concerned, not afraid.\" \"There is another possibility,\" Sos\u0027Umptu said. \"Delay. Maintain that Gromph is still Archmage of Menzoberranzan for as long as possible. For that matter, spread the story that you have sent him off on a special mis-sion and he will not be back for a while. The longer we delay, the more likely it is that events will make the circumstances of his disappearance clearer. If the Army of the Black Spider finds victory in the tunnels to the south, then your position might be strengthened enough that you can do as you will with the archmage\u0027s post.\" Triel nodded. It was a sound piece of advice. Though she hated to admit that if Lolth continued to refuse her spells she might face a chal-lenge for the leadership of the House, it didn\u0027t hurt her to begin strengthening her own ties to Sos\u0027Umptu. She might need all the sisters she could get. The door to the chapel creaked open, and a plump male dressed in elegant black robes entered. He resembled nothing so much as a housecat that had been fed too much, satisfied with his own superiority. Nauzhror Baenre was Triel\u0027s first cousin once removed, the son of one of her mother\u0027s nieces. His familiar, a hairy spider as well fed as the wizard himself, perched on Nauzhror\u0027s shoulder. He was accounted a Master of Sorcere, the only Baenre so recognized other than old Gromph himself, and was reputed to be an abjurer of some skill. Younger than Gromph, he had a habit of main-taining an insouciant smirk that made it hard to gauge what he was think-ing. Try as she might, Triel could not imagine him wearing the robes of the Archmage of Menzoberranzan. \"You sent for me, Matron Mother?\" \"I am going to make it known,\" Triel said, \"that my brother Gromph is engaged in a mission of great importance and secrecy, and will return to resume his duties as Archmage of Menzoberranzan in due time. In the meantime, I am going to allow the Masters of Sorcere to designate a sub-stitute to attend to the responsibilities of the position. You will support the best candidate from either House Xorlarrin or Agrach Dyrr.\" Nauzhror\u0027s smirk failed him. \"M-matron Mother,\" he stammered. \"I ... I had thought that per-haps I should assume the - \" \"Are you Gromph\u0027s equal, Nauzhror?\" Triel asked. The abjurer might have been soft in appearance, but his eyes betrayed a hard and calculating mind - and a pragmatic one, as well. \"Were I the archmage\u0027s equal, Matron Mother, I would have chal-lenged him for his title already.\" He thought for a moment, reaching up to stroke the spider that sat on his shoulder. \"In time I expect to equal and perhaps surpass his skill, but I must study the Art for many years before I can call myself his peer.\" \"As I thought. Consider this, then,\" Triel said. \"Whomever engineered Gromph\u0027s disappearance will most likely make short work of you if you presumed to call yourself Archmage of Menzoberranzan. The day may come when you realize your ambition, cousin, but that day is not today.\" Nauzhror did not hesitate to incline his head and reply, \"Yes, Matron Mother. I will do as you command.\" \"You are now acting House Wizard of House Baenre, Nauzhror. If it turns out that my brother is no more, you will hold the position in earnest, but for now I have need of your spells and counsel. Settle your affairs in Sorcere for the time being. I will have your personal effects brought here.\" Nauzhror genuflected and said, \"I thank you for your confidence in my abilities, Matron Mother.\" \"My confidence in your abilities extends exactly this far, cousin: Do not get killed,\" said Triel. \"As of this moment, any male with the least ap-titude for wizardry in House Baenre is yours to train. We need a cadre of skilled arcanists to equal those fielded by Del\u0027Armgo or Xorlarrin.\" \"Such a collection of talent cannot be produced overnight, Matron Mother. It will be the work of years to match Xorlarrin\u0027s strength in wizardry.\" \"Then it is a work best begun immediately.\" Triel studied the corpulent wizard and found herself hoping against hope that her House\u0027s future did not rest in his oily hands. \"There is one thing more, Nauzhror,\" she said as the wizard stepped away. \"Consider it your first duty as House Wizard.\" Triel moved close and fixed her eyes on his, daring him to smile into her face. \"You will find out what has happened to my brother.\" Ryld barreled through a short, curving corridor, Jezz and Valas at his heels. Danifae helped Quenthel to stagger along behind them. The weapons master followed the corridor back to his right, and emerged into a large hall or ballroom of some kind. The beholder mage drifted there, a hulking monstrosity in the form of a chitin-covered orb six feet across, its ten eyestalks writhing as it hurled spell after spell at Pharaun and Jeggred. The wizard stood encased in a globe of magical energy, some kind of de-fensive spell that protected him while he dueled spell-for-spell with the monster. Jeggred stood immobile, his face locked into a needle-fanged grimace as he struggled to throw off the influence of some baneful spell or another. \"Persistent insects,\" the beholder snarled as it caught sight of Ryld andthe others. \"Leave me be!\" The creature floated back through an open archway, retreating to an-other portion of its lair. Pharaun turned wearily to face the others. One side of his clothing was spattered with smoking holes, where some kind of acid had burned him, and he trembled with fatigue. \"Ah, I see my worthy companions have at last elected to join me,\" he observed. \"Excellent! I was afraid you might miss the pleasure of hazard-ing life and limb against a murderous foe.\" \"What\u0027s wrong with Jeggred?\" Quenthel managed. \"He\u0027s ensnared by a holding spell of some kind, and I expended all of my dispelling magic in my duel. If you can free him, please do so. I wouldn\u0027t want to be selfish, and keep the beholder all to myself.\" \"Shut up, Pharaun,\" Danifae rasped. \"We have to finish the beholder, quick. There\u0027s a pit fiend and a dozen more devils just behind us, and we\u0027re about to be caught between the two.\" The wizard grimaced. A dangerous light flickered in his eyes as he looked at Danifae, then at Jezz the Lame. \"If your magical tome is this much trouble, perhaps we should keep it for ourselves,\" the Master of Sorcere observed. \"Tzirik will not share the results of his divinations with you if you betray us,\" the Jaelre said simply. \"Decide what is more important to you, spider-kisser, and do it quickly.\" \"Stop it, Pharaun,\" Ryld said. He moved overto where Jeggred stood frozen, and laid Splitter along-side the draegloth to break the enchantment that held him. The half-demon blinked his eyes and scowled, slowly straightening. \"One problem at a time,\" Ryld continued. \"Do you have any magic that can keep the devils off our backs long enough for us to defeat the beholder?\" The wizard answered, \"No, they\u0027d be among us in just a moment, and that would be a scene, wouldn\u0027t it? The - wait a moment, I have an idea. We won\u0027t keep out the devils. In fact, we\u0027ll let them in.\" Infernal power crackled and snapped in the room behind them. \"That\u0027s the pit fiend destroying my wall,\" Jezz said. \"Explain quickly, Menzoberranyr.\" Pharaun began chanting a spell, and weaving his hands in the arcane gestures necessary to shape and control his magic. \"Do not resist,\" he told the others. \"Ah, there we go. I\u0027ve covered us all with a veil of illusion. We\u0027re all devils now.\" Ryld glanced down at himself and noted nothing different, but when he looked back up, he saw that he was standing in the middle of a company of barbed devils. He recoiled momentarily, and noticed the other devils flinch-ing too. Faintly, as though draped in a diaphanous gauze, he could see the natural forms of the other dark elves beneath their scaly exteriors. \"I can see through this,\" he warned. \"Yes, but you\u0027re expecting it,\" said the devil who stood where Pharaun had. \"This should create no small amount of confusion for our foes, but we must move quickly. We want the devils to come upon us while we\u0027re dealing with the beholder.\" The wizard glided across the chamber, following the beholder, and the rest of the company fell in behind him, hurrying after Pharaun as the howls of the pursuing devils rose in the corridor behind them. They climbed a spiraling stair and found the beholder waiting for them in what seemed to be a large throne room. The monster hesitated as the company burst in, cloaked in their devilish guises. \"The dark elves are not here,\" the beholder rasped. \"Search the rest of the tower. They must be found!\" \"I\u0027m afraid you are mistaken,\" Pharaun laughed, and he hurled a blast of lightning at the creature that charred a dinner plate sized patch of its chitinous hide. At the same time, Valas fired a pair of arrows that sank into its armored body, while Ryld, Jeggred, and Danifae broke into a charge. The creature recovered from its surprise with incredible alacrity, whirling to flay the attacking drow with its deadly rays and spells. Jeggred was flung across the room with a telekinetic ray, while Danifae had to throw herself flat to avoid the incandescent green sweep of a disintegrat-ing ray. Ryld got three steps farther before no less than three of the mon-ster\u0027s thin eyestalks whipped around, spotting him at once and lashing out with more spells. A hail of incandescent bolts of energy streaked out to meet his charge, punching into his torso like the blows of a dwarven war-hammer. Ryld grunted in pain, and stumbled to the hard floor. At that moment, a flood of devils climbed up out of the staircase behind them, pouring into the room. In the space of half a dozen heart-beats, the scene descended into complete chaos, as the devils thronged the room, some turning angry glares on the beholder, others simply halting in confusion, surprised to find so many of their fellows already in the room. From the floor Danifae pointed up at the beholder and screeched, \"The beholder is in league with the dark elves! Slay it! Eat its eyes!\" The devils paused just long enough for the beholder to scour their front ranks with deadly spells, and they set upon it, flinging themselves at the monster. Rock-hard talons clawed and gouged at the beholder, while devils exploded under bolts of white fire or crumbled into lifeless stone beneath the beholder\u0027s eye rays. Ryld had been about to leap up and engage the monster again, but he caught Pharaun\u0027s cautioning gesture, and feigned injury. The wizard\u0027s strategy was brilliant - let the beholder and the devils battle, and their foes might destroy each other. \"Weak-minded fools!\" the beholder hissed. \"The dark elves have de-ceived you!\" Still it wreaked terrible devastation with its spells and eye rays, trying to repel the devils\u0027 attack. The stink of charred flesh and the eldritch sen-sation of deadly magic filled the air. A palpable sense ofwrong flitted across Ryld\u0027s heart, and a hulking pit fiend climbed into the room. The mighty devil stood twice as tall as a drow, its torso rippling with muscle, its vast black wings mantling it like a cloak of ebon glory. It took in the scene with a malignant, measuring gaze, and Ryld\u0027s heart sank as he realized that the powerful fiend was not in the least deceived by Pharaun\u0027s illusion. With one absent gesture the huge devil conjured up a great, seething orb of black fire in its claw, and hurled the sinister blast at Pharaun. The dark blot exploded in a tremendous explosion of evil flame that rocked the tower to its foundations, throwing Pharaun a dozen feet through the air and scorching him terribly as lesser devils and drow alike were sent flying like ninepins. \"They are right here!\" the creature bellowed in a voice like a roaring forge. \"Destroy the dark elves!\" The pit fiend started to call up another infernal blast, but Jeggred - still veiled in hisdevilish guise - hurled into the mighty fiend\u0027s flank, claw-ing and tearing with abandon. The great devil roared in rage, staggering under the draegloth\u0027s assault. \"Lolth\u0027s sweet chaos,\" Ryld muttered. Which was more dangerous, the beholder mage or the pit fiend? The beholder still blasted any devil it saw, veiled drow or not, and most of the pit fiend\u0027s minions had fallen already. The pit fiend hammered and slashed at Jeggred, who stood toe-to-toe with the infernal lord, giving as good as he got. The weapons master glanced between the two enemies, hesitated only a moment, and decided. Silently as an arrow whispering through the dark, Ryld scrambled up and leaped forward, aiming a tremendous cut at the beholder\u0027s round body. The beholder mage spotted him at once and blasted a bolt of lightning in his direction, but he tumbled aside and kept coming. Another eye fixed on him, and the beholder\u0027s drone took on a peculiarly horrid and deadly sound. Rather than wait to find out what spell the monster could cast with that eye, Ryld altered his path and bounded into the air, reaching out to sever the tentacle cleanly with Splitter\u0027s gleaming blade. The beholder\u0027s drone broke in a piercing shriek of pain. The monster whirled to face Ryld with its jaws gaping, but the weapons master took careful aim and severed another waving eye before ducking down and scrambling beneath the bloated sphere of the hovering creature\u0027s body. None of the beholder\u0027s eyes could see directly beneath its own bulk. Dropping to one knee, Ryld shortened his grip on Splitter, and thrust the greatsword up into the chitinous underside of the monster. Black thick gore streamed down the blade, and the huge monster shuddered and shrieked again. \"Well done!\" Jezz cried. The Jaelre renegade commenced to bark out arcane words, his hands weaving in mystical patterns. He conjured up a seething missile of mystic acid that burned another eyestalk from the beholder\u0027s body as the monster rolled and twisted in agony. Ryld yanked out his sword and rolled aside even as the beholder tried to crush him beneath its bulk, its jaws snapping at him. He found himself looking directly at the front of its body, where its great central eye had once gazed out from an armored carapace. The central eye was nothing but an empty socket. An old lesson came to the weapons master\u0027s mind: a beholder that wished to learn magic had to blind itself in order to do so. The lesser eyes flailed and twisted on their tentacles, trying to focus on Ryld. The weapons master saw his opportunity and his target at the same moment. With one swift bound he drove Splitter like a lance straight through the empty central socket and deep into the creature\u0027s alien brain. With grim determination he sawed the greatsword in and out, side to side, while dark gore spurted and streamed from the awful wound. The beholder gave one great shudder, its jaws snapped shut, and its waving eyestalks - those that remained - went limp. It sank slowly toward the floor. Ryld glanced up and saw another devil closing on him, apparently having discerned his true form through the illusion, and he snatched out his short sword to gut the fiend as it threw itself on him. The devil knocked him to the floor, its foul blood pouring out all over him. Ryld gagged in revulsion and shouldered the jerking corpse aside, wrenching his sword out of the creature\u0027s midsection with his right hand while he dragged Split-ter clear of the beholder mage\u0027s eye with the left. He shook his head to clear his eyes of the blood of his foes. By the chamber\u0027s entrance, Jeggred sprawled to the ground beneath another terrible spell from the pit fiend, a roaring column of fire that blackened the draegloth\u0027s fur and might have incinerated him outright if not for the half-demon\u0027s native resistance to fire. Jeggred screeched and rolled across the floor, trying to smother the burning embers, but as the pit fiend followed to strike at him again, Dan-ifae appeared in front of it and dealt the monster a mighty blow that cracked its kneecap. The devil staggered and flared its wings for balance - and Valas buried three arrows in its back, sinking each shaft feather-deep between the fiend\u0027s shoulder blades. Ryld started forward cautiously, preparing to engage the devil lord in his own turn, but Pharaun, blistered and smoking, rose from the spot where the devil\u0027s fireball had blasted him, and lashed out with a brilliant spray of iridescent colors that caught the pit fiend as it turned to confront the archer. A green ray carved a deep, black, boiling wound in the center of the pit fiend\u0027s torso, while a virulent yellow ray exploded with crackling arcs of electricity as it grazed the devil\u0027s hip. The monster staggered back two steps, and toppled, a smoking corpse. The chamber fell silent as the echoes of its thunderous fall died away. Pharaun picked himself up gingerly, cradling one arm close to his body. One hand and part of his face were mottled and pink, abraded hor-ribly by the fleeting touch of the beholder\u0027s disintegration ray, while his robes smoked with the fading effects of the dark fireball the pit fiend had conjured. The other dark elves slowly relaxed their guard, glancing around in some surprise to find no more foes on the field, and no life-threatening injuries among their number. Quenthel fumbled at her belt and produced Halisstra\u0027s healing wand, which she began to use to repair her own injuries, murmuring quiet prayers as she wielded the device. \"That,\" said Pharaun, \"was not easy. We should have demanded some-thing more from the Jaelre for our services.\" \"You came to us, spider-kisser,\" Jezz said. He limped up to study the beholder\u0027s corpse where it sprawled on the steps of the ancient dais. Valas and Danifae followed, both keeping an eye on the stairwell behind them. \"Spread out and search for the book,\" said the Jaelre. \"We must locate the Geildirion and withdraw before all the devils in Myth Drannor de-scend upon us.\" Jezz followed his own advice at once, ransacking a set of dusty workbenches and cluttered scroll racks along the far side of the be-holder\u0027s room. Ryld sat down on a step and started to scrape the blood from Splitter\u0027s blade. He was exhausted. Jeggred, on the other hand, threw himself into the search, hurling heavy pieces of disused furniture aside and pulling down bookshelves. It occurred to Ryld that the draegloth was unlikely to find that the beholder had stashed a valuable book underneath the wreck-age of a dusty old couch, but it seemed to keep the half-demon occupied. Ryld settled for staying out of the draegloth\u0027s way. \"Hold still, all of you!\" Pharaun said sharply. The wizard spokea spell and commenced to turn slowly in a circle, studying the whole room intently. The rest of the company, including Jezz, halted their hurried ransacking and watched him impatiently. Pharaun continued past Jeggred, past Valas, and halted as he faced a blank wall. He smiled in a predatory fashion, evidently pleased with himself. \"I have defeated the defenses of our deceased adversary,\" he said. \"That wall is an illusion covering an antechamber.\" He gestured again, and part of the wall not far from Ryld abruptly vanished, revealing a large alcove or niche filled with ramshackle book-shelves cluttered with various old tomes and scrolls. Jezz hopped awkwardly to the bookshelf and started rifling through the titles, shoving each into a satchel at his hip. \"Ryld, Jeggred, keep watch,\" said Quenthel. She stood straighter, and the dazed look in her eyes was gone, but she frowned as she replaced the healing wand in her pack. \"Valas, tidy up the beholder\u0027s gold and jewels. There\u0027s no point in leaving the loot here, and one never knows when it might be helpful.\" She looked over at the Jaelre sorcerer, who stood hold-ing a great tome covered in green scales. \"Well, Master Jezz, is that the book you wished to recover?\" Jezz blew dust from the cover and ran his slim fingers over the rough leather. He smiled, his handsome face twisting with glee. \"The Geildirion,\" he breathed. \"Yes, this is the tome. I have what we came for.\" \"Good,\" said Quenthel. \"Let\u0027s get out of here while we can. I think I\u0027ve had all I can stand of this place.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/condemnation-war-of-the-spider-queen-3/page-17.html","bookId":2161,"book":{"id":2161,"title":"Condemnation (War of the Spider Queen #3)","description":"Storyline: Condemnation (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
