{"id":93268,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"1 Danny and Ralphie Glick had gone out to see Mark Petrie with orders to be in by nine, and when they hadn\u0027t come home by ten past, Marjorie Glick called the Petrie house. No, Mrs Petrie said, the boys weren\u0027t there. Hadn\u0027t been there. Maybe your husband had better talk to Henry. Mrs Glick handed the phone to her husband, feeling the lightness of fear in her belly. The men talked it over. Yes, the boys had gone by the woods path. No, the little brook was very shallow at this time of year, especially after the fine weather. No more than ankle-deep. Henry suggested that he start from his end of the path with a high-powered flashlight and Mr Glick start from his. Perhaps the boys had found a woodchuck burrow or were smoking cigarettes or something. Tony agreed and thanked Mr Petrie for his trouble. Mr Petrie said it was no trouble at all. Tony hung up and comforted his wife a little; she was frightened. He had mentally decided that neither of the boys was going to be able to sit down for a week when he found them. But before he had even left the yard, Danny stumbled out from the trees and collapsed beside the back yard barbecue. He was dazed and slow-spoken, responding to questions ploddingly and not always sensibly. There was grass in his cuffs and a few autumn leaves in his hair. He told his father that he and Ralphie had gone down the path through the woods, had crossed Crockett Brook by the stepping stones, and bad gotten up the other bank with no trouble. Then Ralphie began to talk about a ghost in the woods (Danny neglected to mention he had put this idea in his brother\u0027s head). Ralphie said he could see a face. Danny began to be frightened. He didn\u0027t believe in ghosts or in any kid stuff like the bogeyman, but he did think he had heard something in the dark. What did they do then? Danny thought they had started to walk again, holding hands. He wasn\u0027t sure. Ralphie had been whimpering about the ghost. Danny told him not to cry, because soon they would be able to see the streetlights of Jointner Avenue. It was only two hundred steps, maybe less. Then something bad had happened. What? What was the bad thing? Danny didn\u0027t know. They argued with him, grew excited, expostulated. Danny only shook his head slowly and uncomprehend?ingly. Yes, he knew he should remember, but he couldn\u0027t. Honestly, he couldn\u0027t. No, he didn\u0027t remember failing over anything. Just . . . everything was dark. Very dark. And the next thing he remembered was lying on the path by himself. Ralphie was gone. Parkins Gillespie said there was no point in sending men into the woods that night. Too many deadfalls. Probably the boy had just wandered off the path. He and Nolly Gardener and Tony Glick and Henry Petrie went up and down the path and along the shoulders of both South Jointner and Brock streets, hailing with battery-powered bullhorns. Early the next morning, both the Cumberland and the state police began a coordinated search of the wood lot. When they found nothing, the search was widened. They beat the bushes for four days, and Mr and Mrs Glick wandered through the woods and fields, picking their way around the deadfalls left by the ancient fire, calling their son\u0027s name with endless and wrenching hope. When there was no result, Taggart Stream and the Royal River were dragged. No result. On the Morning of the fifth day, Marjorie Glick woke her husband at 4:00 A.M., terrified and hysterical. Danny had collapsed in the upstairs hallway, apparently on his way to the bathroom. An ambulance bore him away to Central Maine General Hospital. The preliminary diag?nosis was severe and delayed emotional shock. The doctor in charge, a man named Gorby, took Mr Glick aside. \u0027Has your boy ever been subject to asthma attacks?\u0027 Mr Glick, blinking rapidly, shook his head. He had aged ten years in less than a week. \u0027Any history of rheumatic fever?\u0027 \u0027Danny? No . . . not Danny.\u0027 \u0027Has he had a TB skin patch during the last year?\u0027 \u0027TB? My boy got TB?\u0027 \u0027Mr Glick, we\u0027re only trying to find out - \u0027 \u0027Marge! Margie, come down here!\u0027 Marjorie Glick got up and walked slowly down the corridor. Her face was pale, her hair absently combed. She looked like a woman in the grip of a deep migraine headache. \u0027Did Danny have a TB skin patch at school this year?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said dully. \u0027When he started school. No reac?tion.\u0027 Gorby asked, \u0027Does he cough in the night?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Complain of aches in the chest or joints?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Painful urination?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Any abnormal bleeding? Bloody-nose or bloody stool or even an abnormal number of scrapes and bruises?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 Gordy smiled and nodded. \u0027We\u0027d like to keep him for tests, if we may.\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 Tony said. \u0027Sure. I got Blue Cross.\u0027 \u0027His reactions are very slow,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027We\u0027re going to do some X rays, a marrow test, a white count - \u0027 Marjorie Glick\u0027s eyes had slowly been widening. \u0027Has Danny got leukemia?\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Mrs Glick, that\u0027s hardly - \u0027 But she had fainted. 2 Ben Mears was one of the \u0027salem\u0027s Lot volunteers who beat the bushes for Ralphie Glick, and he got nothing for his pains other than pants cuffs full of cockleburs and an aggravated case of hay fever brought on by late summer goldenrod. On the third day of the search he came into the kitchen of Eva\u0027s ready to eat a can of ravioli and then fall into bed for a nap before writing. He found Susan Norton bustling around the kitchen stove and preparing some kind of hamburger casserole. The men just home from work were sitting around the table, pretending to talk, and ogling her - she was wearing a faded check shirt tied at the midriff and cut-off corduroy shorts, Eva Miller was ironing in a private alcove off the kitchen. \u0027Hey, what are you doing here?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Cooking you something decent before you fall away to a shadow,\u0027 she said, and Eva snorted laughter from behind the angle of the wall. Ben felt his ears burn. \u0027Cooks real good, she does,\u0027 Weasel said. \u0027I can tell. I been watchin\u0027.\u0027 \u0027If you was watchin\u0027 any more, your eyes woulda fell outta their sockets,\u0027 Grover Verrill said, and cackled. Susan covered the casserole, put it in the oven, and they went out on the back porch to wait for it. The sun was going down red and inflamed. \u0027Any luck?\u0027 \u0027No. Nothing.\u0027 He pulled a battered pack of cigarettes out of his breast pocket and lit one. \u0027You smell like you took a bath in Old Woodsman\u0027s,\u0027 she said. \u0027Fat lot of good it did.\u0027 He held out his arm and showed her number of puffed insect bites and half-healed scratches. \u0027Son of a bitching mosquitoes and goddamn pricker bushes.\u0027 \u0027What do you think happened to him, Ben?\u0027 \u0027God knows.\u0027 He exhaled smoke. \u0027Maybe somebody crept up behind the older brother, coshed him with a sock full of sand or something, and abducted the kid.\u0027 \u0027Do you think he\u0027s dead?\u0027 Ben looked at her to see if she wanted an honest answer or merely a hopeful one. He took her hand and locked his fingers through hers. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said briefly. \u0027I think the kid is dead. No conclusive proof yet, but I think so.\u0027 She shook her head slowly. \u0027I hope you\u0027re wrong. My mom and some of the other ladies have been in to sit with Mrs Glick. She\u0027s out of her mind and so is her husband. And the other boy just wanders around like a ghost.\u0027 \u0027Um,\u0027 Ben said. He was looking up at the Marsten House, not really listening. The shutters were closed; they would open up later on. After dark. The shutters would open after dark. He felt a morbid chill at the thought and its nearly incantatory quality. \u0027 . . . night?\u0027 \u0027Hmm? Sorry.\u0027 He looked around at her. \u0027I said, my dad would like you to come over tomorrow night. Can you?\u0027 \u0027Will you be there?\u0027 \u0027Sure, I will,\u0027 she said, and looked at him. \u0027All right. Good.\u0027 He wanted to look at her - she was lovely in the sunset light - but his eyes were drawn towards the Marsten House as if by a magnet. \u0027It draws you, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 she said, and the reading of his thought, right down to the metaphor, was nearly uncanny. \u0027Yes. It does.\u0027 \u0027Ben, what\u0027s this new book about\u0027? \u0027Not yet,\u0027 he said. \u0027Give it time. I\u0027ll tell you as Soon as I can. It\u0027s . . . got to work itself out.\u0027 She wanted to say I love you at that precise moment, say it with the ease and lack of self-consciousness with which the thought had risen to the surface of her mind, but she bit the words off behind her lips. She did not want to say it while he was looking . . . looking up there. She got up. \u0027I\u0027ll check the casserole.\u0027 When she left him, he was smoking and looking up at the Marsten House. 3 Lawrence Crockett was sitting in his office on the morning of the twenty-second, pretending to read his Monday cor?respondence and keeping an eye on his secretary\u0027s jahoob?ies, when the telephone rang. He had been thinking about his business career in \u0027salem\u0027s Lot, about that small, twink?ling car in the Marsten House driveway, and about deals with the devil. Even before the deal with Straker had been consum?mated (that\u0027s some word, all right, he thought, and his eyes crawled over the front of his secretary\u0027s blouse), Lawrence Crockett was, without doubt, the richest man in \u0027salem\u0027s Lot and one of the richest in Cumberland County, although there was nothing about his office or his person to indicate it. The office was old, dusty, and lighted by two fly-specked yellow globes. The desk was an ancient roll-top, littered with papers, pens, and correspondence. A gluepot stood on one side of it and on the other was a square glass paperweight that showed pictures of his family on its different faces. Poised perilously on top of a stack of ledgers was a glass fish bowl filled with matches, and a sign on the front said, \u0027For Our Matchless Friends.\u0027 Except for three fireproof steel filing cabinets and the secretary\u0027s desk in a small enclosure, the office was barren. There were, however, pictures. Snapshots and photos were everywhere - tacked, stapled, or taped to every available surface. Some were new Polaroid prints, others were colored Kodak shots taken a few years back, still more were curled and yellow?ing black-and-whites, some going back fifteen years. Beneath each was a typed caption: Fine Country Living! Six Rms. or Hilltop Location! Taggart Stream Road, $32, 000 - Cheap! or Fit for a Squire! Ten-Rm. Farmhouse, Burns Road. It looked like a dismal, fly-by-night operation and so it had been until 1957, when Larry Crockett, who was regarded by the better element in Jerusalem\u0027s Lot as only one step above shiftless, had decided that trailers were the wave of the future. In those dim dead days, most people thought of trailers as those cute silvery things you hooked on the back of your car when you wanted to go to Yellowstone National Park and take pictures of your wife and kids standing in front of Old Faithful. In those dim dead days, hardly anyone - even the trailer manufacturers themselves - foresaw a day when the cute silvery things would be replaced by campers, which hooked right over the bed of your Chevy pickup or which could come com?plete and motorized in themselves. Larry, however, had not needed to know these things. A bushleague visionary at best, he had simply gone down to the town office (in those days he was not a selectman; in those days he couldn\u0027t have gotten elected dog catcher) and looked up the Jerusalem\u0027s Lot zoning laws. They were tremendously satisfactory. Peering between the lines, he could see thousands of dollars. The law said you could not maintain a public dumping ground, or have more than three junked cars in your yard unless you also had a junk yard permit, or have a chemical toilet - a fancy and not very accurate term for outhouse - unless it was approved by the Town Health Officer. And that was it. Larry had mortgaged himself to the hilt, had borrowed more, and had bought three trailers. Not cute little silvery things but long, plush, thyroidal monsters with plastic wood paneling and Formica bathrooms. He bought one-?acre plots for each in the Bend, where land was cheap, had set them on cheap foundations, and had gone to work selling them. He had done so in three months, overcoming some initial resistance from people who were dubious about living in a home that resembled a Pullman car, and his profit had been close to ten thousand dollars. The wave of the future had arrived in \u0027salem\u0027s Lot, and Larry Crockett had been right up there shooting the curl. On the day R. T. Straker had walked into his office, Crockett had been worth nearly two million dollars. He had done this as a result of land speculation in a great many neighboring towns (but not in the Lot; you don\u0027t shit where you eat was Lawrence Crockett\u0027s motto), based on the conviction that the mobile-home industry was going to grow like a mad bastard. It did, and my God how the money rolled in. In 1965 Larry Crockett became the silent partner of a contractor named Romeo Poulin, who was building a supermarket plaza in Auburn. Poulin was a veteran corner-cutter, and with his on-the-job know-how and Larry\u0027s way with figures, they made $750,000 apiece and only had to report a third of that to Uncle. It was all extremely satisfactory, and if the supermarket roof had a bad case of the leaks, well, that was life. In 1966-68 Larry bought controlling interests in three Maine mobile-home businesses, going through any number of fancy ownership shuffles to throw the tax people off. To Romeo Poulin he described this process as going into the tunnel of love with girl A, screwing girl B in the car behind you, and ending up holding hands with girl A on the other side. He ended up buying mobile homes from himself, and these incestuous businesses were so healthy they were almost frightening. Deals with the devil, all right, Larry thought, shuffling his papers. When you deal with him, notes come due in brimstone. The people who bought trailers were lower-middle-class blue- or white-collar workers, people who could not raise a down payment on a more conventional house, or older people looking for ways to stretch their social security. The idea of a brand-new six-room house was something to conjure with for these people. For the elderly, there was another advantage, something that others missed but Larry, always astute, had noticed: Trailers were all on one level and there were no stairs to climb. Financing was easy, too. A $500 down payment was usually enough to do business on. And in the bad old barracuda-financing days of the sixties, the fact that the other $9,500 was financed at 24 per cent rarely struck these house-hungry people as a pitfall. And my God! how the money rolled in. Crockett himself had changed very little, even after playing \u0027Let\u0027s Make a Deal\u0027 with the unsettling Mr Straker. No fag decorator came to redo his office. He still got by with the cheap electric fan instead of air conditioning. He wore the same shiny-seat suits or glaring sports jacket combinations. He smoked the same cheap cigars and still dropped by Dell\u0027s on Saturday night to have a few beers and shoot some bumper pool with the boys. He had kept his hand in home town real estate, which had home two fruits: First, it had gotten him elected selectman, and second, it wrote off nicely on his income tax return, be?cause each year\u0027s visible operation was one rung below the break-even point. Besides the Marsten House, he was and had been the selling agent for perhaps three dozen other decrepit manses in the area. There were some good deals of course. But Larry didn\u0027t push them. The money was, after all, rolling in. Too much money, maybe. It was possible, he supposed, to outsmart yourself. To go into the tunnel of love with girl A, screw girl B, come out holding hands with girl A, only to have both of them beat the living shit out of you. Straker had said he would be in touch and that had been fourteen months ago. Now what if - That was when the telephone rang. 4 \u0027Mr Crockett,\u0027 the familiar, accentless voice said. \u0027Straker, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Indeed.\u0027 \u0027I was just thinkin\u0027 about you. Maybe I\u0027m psychic.\u0027 \u0027How very amusing, Mr Crockett. I need a service, please.\u0027 \u0027I thought you might.\u0027 \u0027You will procure a truck, please. A big one. A rental truck, perhaps. Have it at the Portland docks tonight at seven sharp. Custom House Wharf. Two movers will be sufficient, I think.\u0027 \u0027Okay.\u0027 Larry drew a pad over by his right hand, and scrawled: H. Peters, R. Snow. Henry\u0027s U-Haul. 6 at latest. He did not stop to consider how imperative it seemed to follow Straker\u0027s orders to the letter. \u0027There are a dozen boxes to be picked up. All save one go to the shop. The other is an extremely valuable sideboard - a Hepplewhite. Your movers will know it by its size. It is to be taken to the house. You understand?\u0027 \u0027Yeah.\u0027 \u0027Have them put it down cellar. Your men can enter through the outside bulkhead below the kitchen windows. You understand?\u0027 \u0027Yeah. Now, this sideboard - \u0027 \u0027One other service, please. You will procure five stout Yale padlocks. You are familiar with the brand Yale?\u0027 \u0027Everybody is. What - \u0027 \u0027Your movers will lock the shop\u0027s back door when they leave. At the house, they will leave the keys to all five locks on the basement table. When they leave the house, they will padlock the bulkhead door, the front and back doors, and the shed-garage. You understand?\u0027 \u0027Yeah.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, Mr Crockett. Follow all directions ex?plicitly. Good-by.\u0027 \u0027Now, wait just a minute - \u0027 Dead line. 5 It was two minutes of seven when the big orange-and-white truck with \u0027Henry\u0027s U-Haul\u0027 printed on the sides and back pulled up to the corrugated-steel shack at the end of Custom House Wharf at the Portland docks. The tide was on the turn and the gulls were restless with it, wheeling and crying overhead against the sunset crimson sky. \u0027Christ, there\u0027s nobody here,\u0027 Royal Snow said, swigging the last of his Pepsi and dropping the empty to the floor of the cab. \u0027We\u0027ll get arrested for burglars.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s somebody,\u0027 Hank Peters said. \u0027Cop.\u0027 It wasn\u0027t precisely a cop; it was a night watchman. He shone his light in at them. \u0027Either of you guys Lawrence Crewcut?\u0027 \u0027Crockett,\u0027 Royal said. \u0027We\u0027re from him. Come to pick up some boxes.\u0027 \u0027Good,\u0027 the night watchman said. \u0027Come on in the office. I got an invoice for you to sign.\u0027 He gestured to Peters, who was behind the wheel. \u0027Back up right over there. Those double doors with the light burning. See?\u0027 \u0027Yeah.\u0027 He put the truck in reverse. Royal Snow followed the night watchman into the office where a coffee maker was burbling. The clock over the pin-up calendar said 7:04. The night watchman scrabbled through some papers on the desk and came up with a clipboard. \u0027Sign there.\u0027 Royal signed his name. \u0027You want to watch out when you go in there. Turn on the lights. There\u0027s rats.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve never seen a rat that wouldn\u0027t run from one of these,\u0027 Royal said, and swung his work-booted foot in an arc. \u0027These are wharf rats, sonny,\u0027 the watchman said dryly. \u0027They\u0027ve run off with bigger men than you.\u0027 Royal went back out and walked over to the warehouse door. The night watchman stood in the doorway of the shack, watching him, \u0027Look out,\u0027 Royal said to Peters. \u0027The old guy said there was rats.\u0027 \u0027Okay.\u0027 He sniggered. \u0027Good ole Larry Crewcut.\u0027 Royal found the light switch inside the door and turned them on. There was something about the atmosphere, heavy with the mixed aromas of salt and wood rot and wetness, that stifled hilarity. That, and the thought of rats. The boxes were stacked in the middle of the wide ware?house floor. The place was otherwise empty, and the collection looked a little portentous as a result. The side?board was in the center, taller than the others, and the only one not stamped \u0027Barlow and Straker, 27 Jointner Avenue, Jer. Lot, Maine.\u0027 \u0027Well, this don\u0027t look too bad,\u0027 Royal said. He consulted his copy of the invoice and then counted boxes. \u0027Yeah, they\u0027re all here.\u0027 \u0027There are rats,\u0027 Hank said. \u0027Hear \u0027em?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, miserable things. I hate \u0027em.\u0027 They both fell silent for a moment, listening to the squeak and patter coming from the shadows. \u0027Well, let\u0027s get with it,\u0027 Royal said. \u0027Let\u0027s put that big baby on first so it won\u0027t be in the way when we get to the store.\u0027 \u0027Okay.\u0027 They walked over to the box, and Royal took out his pocket knife. With one quick gesture he had slit the brown invoice envelope taped to the side. \u0027Hey Hank said. \u0027Do you think we ought to - \u0027 \u0027We gotta make sure we got the right thing, don\u0027t we? If we screw up, Larry\u0027ll tack our asses to his bulletin board.\u0027 He pulled the invoice out and looked at it. \u0027What\u0027s it say?\u0027 Hank asked. \u0027Heroin,\u0027 Royal said judiciously. \u0027Two hundred pounds of the shit. Also two thousand girlie books from Sweden, three hundred gross of French ticklers - \u0027 \u0027Gimme that.\u0027 Hank snatched it away. \u0027Sideboard,\u0027 he said. \u0027Just like Larry told us. From London, England. Portland, Maine, POE. French ticklers, my ass. Put this back.\u0027 Royal did. \u0027Something funny about this,\u0027 he said. \u0027Yeah, you. Funny like the Italian Army.\u0027 \u0027No, no shit. There\u0027s no customs stamp on this fucker. Not on the box, not on the invoice envelope, not on the invoice. No stamp.\u0027 \u0027They probably do \u0027em in that ink that only shows up under a special black light.\u0027 \u0027They never did when I was on the docks. Christ, they stamped cargo ninety ways for Sunday. You couldn\u0027t grab a box without getting blue ink up to your elbows.\u0027 \u0027Good. I\u0027m very glad. But my wife happens to go to bed very early and I had hopes of getting some tonight.\u0027 \u0027Maybe if we took a look inside - \u0027 \u0027No way. Come on. Grab it.\u0027 Royal shrugged. They tipped the box, and something shifted heavily inside. The box was a bitch to lift. It could be one of those fancy dressers, all right. It was heavy enough. Grunting, they staggered out to the truck and heaved it onto the hydraulic lifter with identical cries of relief. Royal stood back while Hank operated the lift. When it was even with the truck body, they climbed up and walked it inside. There was something about the box he didn\u0027t like. It was more than the lack of customs stamp. An indefinable something. He looked at it until Hank ran down the back gate. \u0027Come on,\u0027 he said. \u0027Let\u0027s get the rest of them.\u0027 The other boxes had regulation customs stamps, except for three that had been shipped here from inside the United States. As they loaded each box onto the truck, Royal checked it off on the invoice form and initialed it. They stacked all of the boxes bound for the new store near the back gate of the truck, away from the sideboard. \u0027Now, who in the name of God is going to buy all this stuff?\u0027 Royal asked when they had finished. \u0027A Polish rocking chair, a German clock, a spinning wheel from Ireland . . . Christ Almighty, I bet they charge a frigging fortune.\u0027 \u0027Tourists,\u0027 Hank said wisely. \u0027Tourists\u0027ll buy anything. Some of those people from Boston and New York they\u0027d buy a bag of cowshit if it was an old bag.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t like that big box, neither,\u0027 Royal said. \u0027No customs stamp, that\u0027s a hell of a funny thing.\u0027 \u0027Well, let\u0027s get it where it\u0027s going.\u0027 They drove back to \u0027salem\u0027s Lot without speaking, Hank driving heavy on the gas. This was one errand he wanted done. He didn\u0027t like it. As Royal had said, it was damn peculiar. He drove around to the back of the new store, and the back door was unlocked, as Larry had said it would be. Royal tried the lightswitch just inside with no result. \u0027That\u0027s nice,\u0027 he grumbled. \u0027We get to unload this stuff in the goddamn dark . . . say, does it smell a little funny in here to you?\u0027 Hank sniffed. Yes, there was an odor, an unpleasant one, but he could not have said exactly what it reminded him of. It was dry and acrid in the nostrils, like a whiff of old corruption. \u0027It\u0027s just been shut up too Ion \u0027 he said, shining his flashlight around the long, empty room. \u0027Needs a good airing out.\u0027 \u0027Or a good burning down,\u0027 Royal said. He didn\u0027t like it. Something about the place put his back up. \u0027Come on. And let\u0027s try not to break our legs.\u0027 They unloaded the boxes as quickly as they could, putting each one down carefully. A half an hour later, Royal closed the back door with a sigh of relief and snapped one of the new padlocks on it. \u0027That\u0027s half of it,\u0027 he said. \u0027The easy half,\u0027 Hank answered. He looked up toward the Marsten House, which was dark and shuttered tonight. \u0027I don\u0027t like goin\u0027 up there, and I ain\u0027t afraid to say so. If there was ever a haunted house, that\u0027s it. Those guys must be crazy, tryin\u0027 to live there. Probably queer for each other anyway.\u0027 \u0027Like those fag interior decorators,\u0027 Royal agreed. \u0027Prob?ably trying to turn it into a showplace. Good for business.\u0027 \u0027Well, if we got to do it, let\u0027s get with it.\u0027 They spared a last look for the crated sideboard leaning against the side of the U-Haul and then Hank pulled the back door down with a bang. He got in behind the wheel and they drove up Jointner Avenue onto the Brooks Road. A minute later the Marsten House loomed ahead of them, dark and crepitating, and Royal felt the first thread of real fear worm its way into his belly. \u0027Lordy, that\u0027s a creepy place,\u0027 Hank murmured. \u0027Who\u0027d want to live there?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. You see any lights on behind those shutters?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 The house seemed to lean toward them, as if awaiting their arrival, Hank wheeled the truck up the driveway and around to the back. Neither of them looked too closely at what the bouncing headlights might reveal in the rank grass of the back yard. Hank felt a strain of fear enter his heart that he had not even felt in Nam, although he had been scared most of his time there. That was a rational fear. Fear that you might step on a pongee stick and see your foot swell up like some noxious green balloon, fear that some kid in black p.j.\u0027s whose name you couldn\u0027t even fit in your mouth might blow your head off with a Russian rifle, fear that you might draw a Crazy Jake on patrol that might want you to blow up everyone in a village where the Cong had been a week before. But this fear was childlike, dreamy. There was no reference point to it. A house was a house - boards and hinges and nails and sills. There was no reason, really no reason, to feel that each splintered crack was exhaling its own chalky aroma of evil. That was just plain stupid thinking. Ghosts? He didn\u0027t believe in ghosts. Not after Nam. He had to fumble twice for reverse, and then backed the truck jerkily up to the bulkhead leading to the cellar. The rusted doors stood open, and in the red glow of the truck\u0027s taillights, the shallow stone steps seemed to lead down into hell. \u0027Man \u0027, I don\u0027t dig this at all,\u0027 Hank said. He tried to smile and it became a grimace. \u0027Me either.\u0027 They looked at each other in the wan dash lights, the fear heavy on both of them. But childhood was beyond them, and they were incapable of going back with the job undone because of irrational fear - how would they explain it in bright daylight? The job had to be done. Hank killed the engine and they got out and walked around to the back of the truck. Royal climbed up, released the door catch, and thrust the door up on its tracks. The box sat there, sawdust still clinging to it, squat and mute. \u0027God, I don\u0027t want to take that down there!\u0027 Hank Peters choked out, and his voice was almost a sob. \u0027Come on up,\u0027 Royal said. \u0027Let\u0027s get rid of it.\u0027 They dragged the box onto the lift and let it down with a hiss of escaping air. When it was at waist level, Hank let go of the lever and they gripped it. \u0027Easy,\u0027 Royal grunted, backing toward the steps. \u0027Easy does it . . . easy . . . \u0027 In the red glow of the taillights his face was constricted and corded like the face of a man having a heart attack. He backed down the stairs one at a time, and as the box tilted up against his chest, he felt its dreadful weight settle against him like a slab of stone. It was heavy, he would think later, but not that heavy. He and Hank had muscled bigger loads for Larry Crockett, both upstairs and down, but there was something about the atmosphere of this place that took the heart out of you and made you no good. The steps were slimy-slick and twice he tottered on the precarious edge of balance, crying out miserably, \u0027Hey! For Christ\u0027s sake! Watch it!\u0027 And then they were down. The ceiling was low above them and they carried the sideboard bent over like hags. \u0027Set it here\" Hank gasped. \u0027I can\u0027t carry it no further!\u0027 They set it down with a thump and stepped away. They looked into each other\u0027s eyes and saw that fear had been changed to near terror by some secret alchemy. The cellar seemed suddenly filled with secret rustling noises. Rats, perhaps, or perhaps something that didn\u0027t even bear think?ing of. They bolted, Hank first and Royal Snow right behind him. They ran up the cellar steps and Royal slammed the bulkhead doors with backward sweeps of his arm. They clambered into the cab of the U-Haul and Hank started it up and put it in gear. Royal grabbed his arm, and in the darkness his face seemed to be all eyes, huge and staring. \u0027Hank, we never put on those locks.\u0027 They both stared at the bundle of new padlocks on the truck\u0027s dashboard, held together by a twist of baling wire. Hank grabbed at his jacket pocket and brought out a key ring with five new Yale keys on it, one which would fit the lock on the back door of the shop in town, four for out here. Each was neatly labeled. \u0027Oh, Christ,\u0027 he said. \u0027Look, if we come back early tomorrow morning - \u0027 Royal unclamped the flashlight under the dashboard. \u0027That won\u0027t work,\u0027 he said, \u0027and you know it.\u0027 They got out of the cab, feeling the cool evening breeze strike the sweat on their foreheads. \u0027Go do the back door,\u0027 Royal said. \u0027I\u0027ll get the front door and the shed.\u0027 They separated. Hank went to the back door, his heart thudding heavily in his chest. He had to fumble twice to thread the locking arm through the hasp. This close to the house, the smell of age and wood rot was palpable. All those stories about Hubie Marsten that they had laughed about as kids began to recur, and the chant they had chased the girls with: Watch out, watch out, watch out! Hubie\u0027ll get you if you don\u0027t. watch . . . OUT - \u0027Hank?\u0027 He drew in breath sharply, and the other lock dropped out of his hands. He picked it up. \u0027You oughtta know better than to creep up on a person like that, Did you . . . ?\u0027 \u0027Yeah. Hank, who\u0027s gonna go down in that cellar again and put the key ring on the table?\u0027 \u0027I dunno,\u0027 Hank Peters said. \u0027I dunno.\u0027 \u0027Think we better flip for it?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I guess that\u0027s best.\u0027 Royal took out a quarter. \u0027Call it in the air.\u0027 He flicked it. \u0027Heads.\u0027 Royal caught it, slapped it on his forearm, and exposed it. The eagle gleamed at them dully. \u0027Jesus,\u0027 Hank said miserably. But he took the key ring and the flashlight and opened the bulkhead doors again. He forced his legs to carry him down the steps, and when he had cleared the roof overhang he shone his light across the visible cellar, which took an L-turn thirty feet further up and went off God knew where. The flashlight beam picked out the table, with a dusty checked tablecloth on it. A rat sat on the table, a huge one, and it did not move when the beam of light struck it. It sat up on its plump haunches and almost seemed to grin. He walked past the box toward the table. \u0027Hsst! Rat!\u0027 The rat jumped down and trotted off toward the elbow?-bend further up. Hank\u0027s hand was trembling now, and the flashlight beam slipped jerkily from place to place, now picking out a dusty barrel, now a decades-old bureau that had been loaded down here, now a stack of old newspapers, now - He jerked the flashlight beam back toward the news?papers and sucked in breath as the light fell on something to the left side of them. A shirt . . . was that a shirt? Bundled up like an old rag. Something behind it that might have been blue jeans. And something that looked like . . . Something snapped behind him. He panicked, threw the keys wildly on the table, and turned away, shambling into a run. As he passed the box, he saw what had made the noise. One of the aluminum bands had let go, and now pointed jaggedly toward the low roof, like a finger. He stumbled up the stairs, slammed the bulkhead behind him (his whole body had crawled into goose flesh; he would not be aware of it until later), snapped the lock on the catch, and ran to the cab of the truck. He was breathing in small, whistling gasps like a hurt dog. He dimly heard Royal asking him what had happened, what was going on down there, and then he threw the truck into drive and screamed out, roaring around the corner of the house on two wheels, digging at the soft earth. He did not slow down until the truck was back on the Brooks Road, speed?ing toward Lawrence Crockett\u0027s office in town. And then he began to shake so badly he was afraid he would have to pull over. \u0027What was down there?\u0027 Royal asked. \u0027What did you see?\u0027 \u0027Nothin\u0027,\u0027 Hank Peters said, and the word came out in sections divided by his clicking teeth. \u0027I didn\u0027t see nothin\u0027 and I never want to see it again.\u0027 6 Larry Crockett was getting ready to shut up shop and go home when there was a perfunctory tap on the door and Hank Peters stepped back in. He still looked scared. \u0027Forget somethin\u0027, Hank?\u0027 Larry asked. When they had come back from the Marsten House, both looking like somebody had given their nuts a healthy tweak, he had given them each an extra ten dollars and two six-packs of Black Label and had allowed as how maybe it would be best if none of them said too much about the evening\u0027s outing. \u0027I got to tell you,\u0027 Hank said now. \u0027I can\u0027t help it, Larry. I got to.\u0027 \u0027Sure you do,\u0027 Larry said. He opened the bottom desk drawer, took out a bottle of Johnnie Walker, and poured them each a knock in a couple of Dixie cups. \u0027What\u0027s on your mind?\u0027 Hank took a mouthful, grimaced, and swallowed it. \u0027When I took those keys down to put \u0027em on the table, I seen something. Clothes, it looked like. A shirt and maybe some dungarees. And a sneaker. I think it was a sneaker, Larry.\u0027 Larry shrugged and smiled. \u0027So?\u0027 It seemed to him that a large lump of ice was resting in his chest. \u0027That little Glick boy was wearin\u0027 jeans. That\u0027s what it said in the Ledger. Jeans and a red pull-over shirt and sneaks. Larry, what if - \u0027 Larry kept smiling. The smile felt frozen on. Hank gulped convulsively. \u0027What if those guys that bought the Marsten House and that store blew up the Glick kid?\u0027 There. It was out. He swallowed the rest of the liquid fire in his cup. Smiling, Larry said, \u0027Maybe you saw a body, too.\u0027 \u0027No - no. But - \u0027 \u0027That\u0027d be a matter for the police,\u0027 Larry Crockett said. He refilled Hank\u0027s cup and his hand didn\u0027t tremble at all. It was as cold and steady as a rock in a frozen brook. \u0027And I\u0027d drive you right down to see Parkins. But something like this . . .\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027A lot of nastiness can come up. Things like you and that waitress out to Dell\u0027s . . . her name\u0027s Jackie, ain\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027What the hell are you talking about?\u0027 His face had gone deadly pale. \u0027And they\u0027d sure as shit find out about that dishonorable discharge of yours. But you do your duty, Hank. Do it as you see it.\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t see no body,\u0027 Hank whispered. \u0027That\u0027s good,\u0027 Larry said, smiling. \u0027And maybe you didn\u0027t see any clothes, either. Maybe they were just . . . rags.\u0027 \u0027Rags,\u0027 Hank Peters said hollowly. \u0027Sure, you know those old places. All kinds of junk in em. Maybe you saw some old shirt or something that was torn up for a cleaning rag.\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 Hank said. He drained his glass a second time. \u0027You got a good way of looking at things, Larry.\u0027 Crockett took his wallet out of his back pocket, opened it, and counted five ten-dollar bills out on the desk. \u0027What\u0027s that for?\u0027 \u0027Forgot all about paying you for that Brennan job last month. You should prod me about those things, Hank. You know how I forget things.\u0027 \u0027But you did - \u0027 \u0027Why,\u0027 Larry interrupted, smiling, \u0027you could be sitting right here and telling me something, and I wouldn\u0027t re?member a thing about it tomorrow morning. Ain\u0027t that a pitiful way to be?\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Hank whispered. His hand reached out trem?bling and took the bills; stuffed them into the breast pocket of his denim jacket as if anxious to be rid of the touch of them. He got up with such jerky hurriedness that he almost knocked his chair over. \u0027Listen, I got to go, Larry. I . . . I didn\u0027t . . . I got to go.\u0027 \u0027Take the bottle,\u0027 Larry invited, but Hank was already going out the door. He didn\u0027t pause. Larry sat back down. He poured himself another drink. His hand still did not tremble. He did not go on shutting up shop. He had another drink, and then another. He thought about deals with the devil. And at last his phone rang. He picked it up. Listened. \u0027It\u0027s taken care of,\u0027 Larry Crockett said. He listened. He hung up. He poured himself another drink. 7 Hank Peters woke up in the early hours of the next morning from a dream of huge rats crawling out of an open grave, a grave which held the green and rotting body of Hubie Marsten, with a frayed length of manila hemp around his neck. Peters Jay propped on his elbows, breathing heavily, naked torso slicked with sweat, and when his wife touched his arm he screamed aloud. 8 Milt Crossen\u0027s Agricultural Store was located in the angle formed by the intersection of Jointner Avenue and Rail?road Street, and most of the town\u0027s old codgers went there when it rained and the park was uninhabitable. During the long winters, they were a day-by-day fixture. When Straker drove up in that \u002739 Packard - or was it a \u002740? - it was just misting gently, and Milt and Pat Middler were having a desultory conversation about whether Freddy Overlock\u0027s girl Judy run off in 1957 or \u002758. They both agree that she had run off with that Saladmaster salesman from Yarmouth, and they both agreed that he hadn\u0027t been worth a pisshole in the snow, nor was she, but beyond that they couldn\u0027t get together. All conversation ceased when Straker walked in. He looked around at them - Milt and Pat Middler and Joe Crane and Vinnie Upshaw and Clyde Corliss - and smiled humorlessly. \u0027Good afternoon, gentlemen,\u0027 he said. Milt Crossen stood up, pulling his apron around him almost primly. \u0027Help you?\u0027 \u0027Very good,\u0027 Straker said. \u0027Attend over at this meat case, please.\u0027 He bought a roast of beef, a dozen prime ribs, some hamburger, and a pound of calves\u0027 liver. To this he added some dry goods - flour, sugar, beans - and several loaves of ready-made bread. His shopping took place in utter silence. The store\u0027s babitu6s sat around the large Pearl Kineo stove that Milt\u0027s father had converted to range oil, smoked, looked wisely out at the sky, and observed the stranger from the corners of their eyes. When Milt had finished packing the goods into a large cardboard carton, Straker paid with hard cash - a twenty and a ten. He picked up the carton, tucked it under one arm, and flashed that hard, humorless smile at them again. \u0027Good day, gentlemen,\u0027 he said, and left. Joe Crane tamped a load of Planter\u0027s into his corncob. Clyde Corliss hawked back and spat a mass of phlegm and chewing tobacco into the dented pail beside the stove. Vinnie Upshaw produced his old Top cigarette roller from inside his vest, spilled a line of tobacco into it, and inserted a cigarette paper with arthritis-swelled fingers. They watched the stranger lift the carton into the trunk. All of them knew that the carton must have weighed thirty pounds with the dry goods, and they had all seen him tuck it under his arm like a feather pillow going out. He went around to the driver\u0027s side, got in, and drove off up Jointner Avenue. The car went up the hill, turned left onto the Brooks Road, disappeared, and reappeared from behind the screen of trees a few moments later, now toy-sized with distance. It turned into the Marsten driveway and was lost from sight. \u0027Peculiar fella,\u0027 Vinnie said. He stuck his cigarette in his mouth, plucked a few bits of tobacco from the end of it, and took a kitchen match from his vest pocket. \u0027Must be one of the ones got that store,\u0027 Joe Crane said. \u0027Marsten House, too,\u0027 Vinnie agreed. Clyde Corliss broke wind. Pat Middler picked at a callus on his left palm with great interest. Five minutes passed. \u0027Do you suppose they\u0027ll make a go of it?\u0027 Clyde asked no one in particular. \u0027Might,\u0027 Vinnie said. \u0027They might show up right pert in the summertime. Hard to tell the way things are these days.\u0027 A general murmur, sigh almost, of agreement. \u0027Strong fella,\u0027 Joe said. \u0027Ayuh,\u0027 Vinnie said. \u0027That was a thirty-nine Packard, and not a spot of rust on her.\u0027 \"Twas a forty,\u0027 Clyde said. \u0027The forty didn\u0027t have runnin\u0027 boards,\u0027 Vinnie said. \"Twas a thirty-nine.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re wrong on that one,\u0027 Clyde said. Five minutes passed. They saw Milt was examining the twenty Straker had paid with. \u0027That funny money, Milt?\u0027 Pat asked. \u0027That fella give you some funny money?\u0027 \u0027No; but look.\u0027 Milt passed it across the counter and they all stared at it. It was much bigger than an ordinary bill. Pat held it up to the light, examined it, then turned it over. \u0027That\u0027s a series E twenty, ain\u0027t it, Milt?\u0027 \u0027Yep,\u0027 Milt said. \u0027They stopped makin\u0027 those forty-five or fifty years back. My guess is that\u0027d be worth some money down to Arcade Coin in Portland.\u0027 Pat handed the bill around and each examined it, holding it up close or far off depending on the flaws in their eyesight. Joe Crane handed it back, and Milt put it under the cash drawer with the personal checks and the coupons. \u0027Sure is a funny fella,\u0027 Clyde mused. \u0027Ayuh,\u0027 Vinnie said, and paused. \u0027That was a thirty-nine, though. My half brother Vic had one. Was the first car he ever owned. Bought it used, he did, in 1944. Left the oil out of her one mornin\u0027 and burned the goddamn pistons right out of her.\u0027 \u0027I believe it was a forty,\u0027 Clyde said,\u0027 because I remember a fella that used to cane chairs down by Alfred, come right to your house he would, and - \u0027 And so the argument was begun, progressing more in the silences than in the speeches, like a chess game p aye by mail. And the day seemed to stand still and stretch into eternity for them, and Vinnie Upshaw began to make another cigarette with sweet, arthritic slowness. 9 Ben was writing when the tap came at the door, and he marked his place before getting up to open it. It was just after three o\u0027clock on Wednesday, September 24. The rain had ended any plans to search further for Ralphie Glick, and the consensus was that the search was over. The Glick boy was gone . . . solid gone. He opened the door and Parkins Gillespie was standing there, smoking a cigarette. He was holding a paperback in one hand, and Ben saw with some amusement that it was the Bantam edition of Conway\u0027s Daughter. \u0027Come on in, Constable,\u0027 he said. \u0027Wet out there.\u0027 \u0027It is, a trifle,\u0027 Parkins said, stepping in. \u0027September\u0027s grippe weather. I always wear in\u0027 galoshes. There\u0027s some that laughs, but I ain\u0027t had the grippe since St.-L?, France, in 1944.\u0027 \u0027Lay your coat on the bed. Sorry I can\u0027t offer you coffee.\u0027 \u0027Wouldn\u0027t think of wettin\u0027 it,\u0027 Parkins said, and tapped ash in Ben\u0027s wastebasket. \u0027And I just had a cup of Pauline\u0027s down to the Excellent.\u0027 \u0027Can I do something for you?\u0027 \u0027Well, my wife read this. . . . \u0027 He held up the book. She heard you was in town, but she\u0027s shy. She kind of thought maybe you might write your name in it, or somethin\u0027.\u0027 Ben took the book. \u0027The way Weasel Craig tells it, your wife\u0027s been dead fourteen or fifteen years.\u0027 \u0027That so?\u0027 Parkins looked totally unsurprised. \u0027That Weasel, he does love to talk. He\u0027ll open his mouth too wide one day and fall right in.\u0027 Ben said nothing. \u0027Do you s\u0027pose you could sign it for me, then?\u0027 \u0027Delighted to.\u0027 He took a pen from the desk, opened the book to the flyleaf (\u0027A raw slice of life!\u0027 - Cleveland Plain Dealer), and wrote: Best wishes to Constable Gillespie, from Ben Mears, 9/24/75. He handed it back. \u0027I appreciate that,\u0027 Parkins said, without looking at what Ben had written. He bent over and crushed out his smoke on the side of the wastebasket. \u0027That\u0027s the only signed book I got.\u0027 \u0027Did you come here to brace me?\u0027 Ben asked, smiling. \u0027You\u0027re pretty sharp,\u0027 Parkins said. \u0027I figured I ought to come and ask a question or two, now that you mention it. Waited until Nolly was off somewheres. He\u0027s a good boy, but he likes to talk, too. Lordy, the gossip that goes on.\u0027 \u0027What would you like to know?\u0027 \u0027Mostly where you were on last Wednesday evenin\u0027.\u0027 \u0027The night Ralphie Glick disappeared?\u0027 \u0027Yeah.\u0027 \u0027Am I a suspect, Constable?\u0027 \u0027No, sir. I ain\u0027t got no suspects. A thing like this is outside my tour, you might say. Catchin\u0027 speeders out by Dell\u0027s or chasin\u0027 kids outta the park before they turn randy is more my line. I\u0027m just nosin\u0027 here and there.\u0027 \u0027Suppose I don\u0027t want to tell you.\u0027 Parkins shrugged and produced his cigarettes. \u0027That\u0027s your business, son.\u0027 \u0027I had dinner with Susan Norton and her folks. Played some badminton with her dad.\u0027 \u0027Bet he beat you, too. He always beats Nolly. Nolly raves up and down about how bad he\u0027d like to beat Bill Norton just once. What time did you leave?\u0027 Ben laughed, but the sound did not contain a great deal of humor. \u0027You cut right to the bone, don\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027You know,\u0027 Parkins said, \u0027if I was one of those New York detectives like on TV, I might think you had somethin\u0027 to hide, the way you polka around my questions.\u0027 \u0027Nothing to hide,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027I\u0027m just tired of being the stranger in town, getting pointed at in the streets, being nudged over in the library. Now you come around with this Yankee trader routine, trying to find out if I\u0027ve got Ralphie Glick\u0027s scalp in my closet.\u0027 \u0027Now, I don\u0027t think that, not at all.\u0027 He gazed at Ben over his cigarette, and his eyes had gone flinty. \u0027I\u0027m just tryin\u0027 to close you off. If I thought you had anything to do with anything, you\u0027d be down in the tank.\u0027 \u0027Okay,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027I left the Nortons around quarter past? seven. I took a walk out toward Schoolyard Hill. When it got too dark to see, I came back here, wrote for two hours, and went to bed.\u0027 \u0027What time did you get back here?\u0027 \u0027Quarter past eight, I think. Around there.\u0027 \u0027Well, that don\u0027t clear you as well as I\u0027d like. Did you see anybody?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027No one.\u0027 Parkins made a noncommittal grunt and walked toward the typewriter. \u0027What are you writin\u0027 about?\u0027 \u0027None of your damn business,\u0027 Ben said, and his voice had gone tight. \u0027I\u0027ll thank you to keep your eyes and your hands off that. Unless you\u0027ve got a search warrant, of course.\u0027 \u0027Kind of touchy, ain\u0027t you? For a man who means his books to be read?\u0027 \u0027When it\u0027s gone through three drafts, editorial correc?tion, galley-proof corrections, final set and print, I\u0027ll per?sonally see that you get four copies. Signed. Right now that comes under the heading of private papers.\u0027 Parkins smiled and moved away. \u0027Good enough. I doubt like hell that it\u0027s a signed confession to anything, anyway.\u0027 Ben smiled back. \u0027Mark Twain said a novel was a con?fession to everything by a man who had never done any?thing.\u0027 Parkins blew out smoke and went to the door. \u0027I won\u0027t drip on your rug anymore, Mr Mears. Want to thank you for y\u0027time, and just for the record, I don\u0027t think you ever saw that Glick boy. But it\u0027s my job to kind of ask round about these things.\u0027 Ben nodded. \u0027Understood.\u0027 \u0027And you oughtta know how things are in places like Isalem\u0027s Lot or Milbridge or Guilford or any little pissant burg. You\u0027re the stranger in town until you been here twenty years.\u0027 \u0027I know. I\u0027m sorry if I snapped at you. But after a week of looking for him and not finding a goddamned thing Ben shook his head. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Parkins said. \u0027It\u0027s bad for his mother. Awful bad. You take care.\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027No hard feelin\u0027s?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 He paused. \u0027Will you tell me one thing?\u0027 \u0027I will if I can.\u0027 \u0027Where did you get that book? Really?\u0027 Parkins Gillespie smiled. \u0027Well, there\u0027s a fella over in Cumberland that\u0027s got a used-furniture barn. Kind of a sissy fella, he is. Name of Gendron. He sells paperbacks a dime apiece. Had five of these.\u0027 Ben threw back his head and laughed, and Parkins Gillespie went out, smiling and smoking. Ben went to the window and watched until he saw the constable come out and cross the street, walking carefully around puddles in his black galoshes. 10 Parkins paused a moment to look in the show window of the new shop before knocking on the door. When the place had been the Village Washtub, a body could look in here and see nothing but a lot of fat women in rollers adding bleach or getting change out of the machine on the wall, most of them chewing gum like cows with mouthfuls of mulch. But an interior decorator\u0027s truck from Portland had been here yesterday afternoon and most of today, and the place looked considerably different. A platform had been shoved up behind the window, and it was covered with a swatch of deep nubby carpet, light green in color. Two spotlights had been installed up out of sight, and they cast soft, highlighting glows on the three objects that bad been arranged in the window: a clock, a spinning wheel, and an old-fashioned cherrywood cabinet. There was a small easel in front of each piece, and a discreet price tag on each easel, and my God, would anybody in their right mind actually pay $600 for a spinning wheel when they could go down to the Value House and get a Singer for $48.95? Sighing, Parkins went to the door and knocked. It was opened only a second later, almost as if the new fella had been lurking behind it, waiting for him to come to the door. \u0027Inspector!\u0027 Straker said with a narrow smile. \u0027How good of you to drop by!\u0027 \u0027Plain old constable, I guess,\u0027 Parkins said. He lit a Pall Mall and strolled in, \u0027Parkins Gillespie. Pleased to meet you.\u0027 He stuck out his hand. It was gripped, squeezed gently by a hand that felt enormously strong and very dry, and then dropped. \u0027Richard Throckett Straker,\u0027 the bald man said. \u0027I figured you was,\u0027 Parkins said, looking around. The entire shop had been carpeted and was in the process of being painted. The smell of fresh paint was a good one, but there seemed to be another smell underneath it, an unpleasant one. Parkins could not place it; he turned his attention back to Straker. \u0027What can I do for you on this so-fine day?\u0027 Straker asked. Parkins turned his mild gaze out the window, where the rain continued to pour down. \u0027Oh, nothing at all, I guess. I just came by to say how-do. More or less welcome you to the town an\u0027 wish you good luck, I guess.\u0027 \u0027How thoughtful. Would you care for a coffee? Some sherry? I have both out back.\u0027 \u0027No thanks, I can\u0027t stop. Mr Barlow around?\u0027 \u0027Mr Barlow is in New York, on a buying trip. I don\u0027t expect him back until at least the tenth of October.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll be openin\u0027 without him, then,\u0027 Parkins said, thinking that if the prices he had seen in the window were any indication, Straker wouldn\u0027t exactly be swamped with customers. \u0027What\u0027s Mr Barlow\u0027s first name, by the way?\u0027 Straker\u0027s smile reappeared, razor-thin. \u0027Are you asking in your official capacity, ah . . . Constable?\u0027 \u0027Nope. Just curious.\u0027 \u0027My partner\u0027s full name is Kurt Barlow,\u0027 Straker said. \u0027We have worked together in both London and Hamburg. This\u0027 - he swept his arm around him - \u0027this is our retire?ment. Modest. Yet tasteful. We expect to make no more than a living. Yet we both love old things, fine things, and we hope to make a reputation in the area . . . perhaps even throughout your so-beautiful New England region. Do you think that would be possible, Constable Gillespie?\u0027 \u0027Anything\u0027s possible, I guess,\u0027 Parkins said, looking around for an ash tray. He saw none, and tapped his cigarette ash into his coat pocket. \u0027Anyway, I hope you\u0027ll have the best of luck, and tell Mr Barlow when you see him that I\u0027m gonna try and get around.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027l I do so,\u0027 Straker said. \u0027He enjoys company. \u0027That\u0027s fine,\u0027 Gillespie said. He went to the door, paused, looked back. Straker was looking at him intently. \u0027By the way, how do you like that old house?\u0027 \u0027It needs a great deal of work,\u0027 Straker said. \u0027But we have time.\u0027 \u0027I guess you do,\u0027 Parkins agreed. \u0027Don\u0027t suppose you seen any yow\u0027uns up around there.\u0027 Straker\u0027s brow creased. \u0027Yowwens?\u0027 \u0027Kids,\u0027 Parkins explained patiently. \u0027You know how they sometimes like to devil new folks. Throw rocks or ring the bell an\u0027 run away . . . that sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Straker said. \u0027No children.\u0027 \u0027We seem to kind have misplaced one.\u0027 \u0027Is that so?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 Parkins said judiciously, \u0027yes, it is. The thinkin\u0027 now is that we may not find him. Not alive.\u0027 \u0027What a shame,\u0027 Straker said distantly. \u0027It is, kinda. If you should see anything . . . \u0027 \u0027I would of course report it to your office, posthaste.\u0027 He smiled his chilly smile again. \u0027That\u0027s good,\u0027 Parkins said. He opened the door and looked resignedly out at the pouring rain. \u0027You tell Mr Barlow that I\u0027m lookin\u0027 forward.\u0027 \u0027I certainly will, Constable Gillespie. Ciao.\u0027 Parkins looked back, startled. \u0027Chow?\u0027 Straker\u0027s smile widened. \u0027Good-by, Constable Gillespie. That is the familiar Italian expression for good-by.\u0027 \u0027Oh? Well, you learn somethin\u0027 new every day, don\u0027t you? \u0027By.\u0027 He stepped out into the rain and closed the door behind him. \u0027Not familiar to me, it ain\u0027t.\u0027 His cigarette was soaked. He threw it away. Inside, Straker watched him up the street through the show window. He was no longer smiling. 11 When Parkins got back to his office in the Municipal Building, he called, \u0027Nolly? You here, Nolly?\u0027 No answer. Parkins nodded. Nolly was a good boy, but a little bit short on brains. He took off his coat, unbuckled his galoshes, sat down at his desk, looked up a telephone number in the Portland book, and dialed. The other end picked up on the first ring. \u0027FBI, Portland. Agent Hanrahan.\u0027 \u0027This is Parkins Gillespie. Constable at Jerusalem\u0027s Lot township. We\u0027ve got us a missin\u0027 boy up here.\u0027 \u0027So I understand,\u0027 Hanrahan said crisply. \u0027Ralph Glick. Nine years old, four-three, black hair, blue eyes. What is it, kidnap note?\u0027 \u0027Nothin\u0027 like that. Can you check on some fellas for me?\u0027 Hanrahan answered in the affirmative. \u0027First one is Benjaman Mears. M-E-A-R-S. Writer. Wrote a book called Conway\u0027s Daughter. The other two are sorta stapled together. Kurt Barlow. B-A-R-L-O-W. The other guy - \u0027 \u0027You spell that Kurt with a \"c\" or a \"k\"?\u0027 Hanrahan asked. \u0027I dunno.\u0027 \u0027Okay. Go on.\u0027 Parkins did so, sweating. Talking to the real law always made him feel like an asshole. \u0027The other guy is Richard Throckett Straker. Two t\u0027s on the end of Throckett, and Straker like it sounds. This guy and Barlow are in the furniture and antique business. They just opened a little shop here in town. Straker claims Barlow\u0027s in New York on a buyin\u0027 trip. Straker claims the two of them worked together in London an\u0027 Hamburg. And I guess that pretty well covers it.\u0027 \u0027Do you suspect these people in the Glick case?\u0027 \u0027Right now I don\u0027t know if there even is a case. But they all showed up in town about the same time.\u0027 \u0027Do you think there\u0027s any connection between this guy Mears and the other two?\u0027 Parkins leaned back and cocked an eye out the window. \u0027That,\u0027 he said, \u0027is one of the things I\u0027d like to find out.\u0027 12 The telephone wires make an odd humming on clear, cool days, almost as if vibrating with the gossip that is transmitted through them, and it is a sound like no other ?the lonely sound of voices flying over space. The telephone poles are gray and splintery, and the freezes and thaws of winter have heaved them into leaning postures that are casual. They are not businesslike and military, like phone poles anchored in concrete. Their bases are black with tar if they are beside paved roads, and floured with dust if beside the back roads. Old weathered cleat marks show on their surfaces where linemen have climbed to fix some?thing in 1946 or 1952 or 1969. Birds - crows, sparrows, robins, starlings - roost on the humming wires and sit in hunched silence, and perhaps they hear the foreign human sounds through their taloned feet. If so, their beady eyes give no sign. The town has a sense, not of history, but of time, and the telephone poles seem to know this. If you lay your hand against one, you can feel the vibration from the wires deep in the wood, as if souls had been imprisoned in there and were struggling to get out. \u0027 . . . and he paid with an old twenty, Mabel, one of the big ones. Clyde said he hadn\u0027t seen one of those since the run on the Gates Bank and Trust in 1930. He was . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . yes, he is a peculiar sort of man, Evvie. I\u0027ve seen him through my binocs, trundling around behind the house with a wheelbarrer. Is he up there alone, I wonder, or . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . Crockett might know, but he won\u0027t tell. He\u0027s keep?ing shut about it. He always was a . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . writer at Eva\u0027s. I wonder if Floyd Tibbits knows he\u0027s been . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . spends an awful lot of time at the library. Loretta Starcher says she never saw a fella who knew so many . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . she said his name was . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . yes, it\u0027s Straker. Mr R. T. Straker. Kenny Danles\u0027s mom said she stopped by that new place downtown and there was a genuine DeBiers cabinet in the window and they wanted eight hundred dollars for it. Can you imagine? So I said . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . funny, him coming and that little Glick boy . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . you don\u0027t think . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . no, but it is funny. By the way, do you still have that recipe for . . . \u0027 The wires hum. And hum. And hum. 13 9/23/75 Name: Glick, Daniel Francis Address: RFD #I, Brock Road, Jerusalem\u0027s Lot, Maine 04270 Age: 12 Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Admitted: 9/22/75 Admitting Person: Anthony H.

Gorby Attending Physician 14 At one o\u0027clock in the morning, September 24, t nurse stepped into Danny Glick\u0027s hospital room to give him his medication. She paused in the doorway, frowning. The bed was empty. Her eyes jumped from the bed to the oddly wasted white bundle that lay collapsed by the foot. \u0027Danny?\u0027 she said. She stepped toward him and thought, He had to go to the bathroom and it was too much for him, that\u0027s all. She turned him over gently, and her first thought before realizing that he was dead was that the B12 had been helping; he looked better than he had since his admission. And then she felt the cold flesh of his wrist and the lack of movement in the light blue tracery of veins beneath her fingers, and she ran for the nurses\u0027 station to report a death on the ward.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/salem-s-lot/page-6.html","bookId":2573,"book":{"id":2573,"title":"\u0027Salem\u0027s Lot","description":"Storyline: Something strange is going on in Jerusalem\u0027s Lot ... but no one dares to talk about it.
