Everett McCutcheon, of Hampden Academy, for his practical suggestions and en?couragement; Dr John Pearson, of Old Town, Maine, medical examiner of Penobscot County and member in good standing of that most excellent medical speciality, general practice; Father Renald Hallee, of St John\u0027s Catholic Church in Bangor, Maine. And of course my wife, whose criticism is as tough and unflinching as ever.\\n\\n Although the towns surrounding \u0027salem\u0027s Lot are very real, \u0027salem\u0027s Lot itself exists wholly in the author\u0027s imagin?ation, and any resemblance between the people who live there and people who live in the real world is coincidental and unintended.\\n\\n S.

By day, \u0027Salem\u0027s Lot is a typical modest New England town; but when the sun goes down, evil roams the earth. The devilishly sweet insistent laughter of a child can be heard echoing through the fields, and the presence of silent looming spirits can be felt lurking right outside your window. Stephen King brings his gruesome imagination to life in this tale of spine tingling horror.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/salem-s-lot.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/salem-s-lot.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:27 PM"}}
