{"id":93273,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"1\\n\\n Susan arrived home from Portland a little after three in the afternoon, and came into the house carrying three crackling brown department-store bags - she had sold two paintings for a sum totaling just over eighty dollars and had gone on a small spree. Two new skirts and a cardigan top.\\n\\n \u0027Suze?\u0027 Her mother called. \u0027Is that you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m home. I got - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come in here, Susan. I want to talk to you.\u0027\\n\\n She recognized the tone instantly, although she had not heard it to that precise degree since her high school days, when the arguments over hem lines and boy friends had gone on day after bitter day.\\n\\n She put down her bags and went into the living room. Her mother had grown colder and colder on the subject of Ben Mears, and Susan supposed this was to be her Final Word.\\n\\n Her mother was sitting in the rocker by the bay window, knitting. The TV was off. The two in conjunction were an ominous sign.\\n\\n \u0027I suppose you haven\u0027t heard the latest,\u0027 Mrs Norton said. Her needles clicked rapidly, meshing the dark green yam she was working with into neat rows. Someone\u0027s winter scarf. \u0027You left too early this morning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Latest?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mike Ryerson died at Matthew Burke\u0027s house last night, and who should be in attendance at the deathbed but your writer friend, Mr Ben Mears!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mike . . . Ben . . . what?\u0027\\n\\n Mrs Norton smiled grimly. \u0027Mabel called around ten this morning and told me. Mr Burke says he met Mike down at Delbert Markey\u0027s tavern last night - although what a teacher is doing bar-hopping I don\u0027t know - and brought him home with him because Mike didn\u0027t look well. He died in the night. And no one seems to know just what Mr Mears was doing there!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They know each other,\u0027 Susan said absently. \u0027In fact, Ben says they hit it off really well . . . what happened to Mike, Mom?\u0027\\n\\n But Mrs Norton was not to be sidetracked so quickly. \u0027Nonetheless, there\u0027s some that think we\u0027ve had a little too much excitement in \u0027salem\u0027s Lot since Mr Ben Mears showed his face. A little too much altogether.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s foolishness!\u0027 Susan said, exasperated. \u0027Now, what did Mike - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027They haven\u0027t decided that yet,\u0027 Mrs Norton said. She twirled her ball of yarn and let out slack. \u0027There\u0027s some that think he may have caught a disease from the little Glick boy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If so, why hasn\u0027t anyone else caught it? Like his folks?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Some young people think they know everything,\u0027 Mrs Norton remarked to the air. Her needles flashed up and down.\\n\\n Susan got up. \u0027I think I\u0027ll go downstreet and see if - \u0027\\n\\n Sit back down a minute,\u0027 Mrs Norton said. \u0027I have a few more things to say to you.\u0027\\n\\n Susan sat down again, her face neutral.\\n\\n \u0027Sometimes young people don\u0027t know all there is to know,\u0027 Ann Norton said. A spurious tone of comfort had come into her voice that Susan distrusted immediately.\\n\\n \u0027Like what, Mom?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it seems that Mr Ben Mears had an accident a few years ago. Just after his second book was published. A motorcycle accident. He was drunk. His wife was killed.\u0027\\n\\n Susan stood up. \u0027I don\u0027t want to hear any more.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m telling you for your own good,\u0027 Mrs Norton said calmly.\\n\\n \u0027Who told you?\u0027 Susan asked. She felt none of the old hot and impotent anger, or the urge to run upstairs away from that calm, knowing voice and weep. She only felt cold and distant, as if drifting in space. \u0027It was Mabel Werts, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s true.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure it is. And we won in Vietnam and Jesus Christ drives through the center of town in a gocart every day at high noon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mabel thought he looked familiar,\u0027 Ann Norton said, land so she went through the back issues of her newspapers box by box - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027You mean the scandal sheets? The ones that specialize in astrology and pictures of car wrecks and starlets\u0027 tits? Oh, what an informed source.\u0027 She laughed harshly.\\n\\n \u0027No need to be obscene. The story was right there in black and white. The woman - his wife if she really was - ?was riding on the back seat and he skidded on the pavement and they went smack into the side of a moving van. They gave him a breathalyzer test on the spot, the article said. Right . . . on . . . the spot.\u0027 She emphasized intensifier, preposition, and object by tapping a knitting needle against the arm of her rocker.\\n\\n \u0027Then why isn\u0027t he in prison?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027These famous fellows always know people,\u0027 she said with calm certainty. \u0027There are ways to get out of every?thing, if you\u0027re rich enough. Just look at what those Kennedy boys have gotten away with.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Was he tried in court?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told you, they gave him a - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027You said that, Mother. But was he drunk?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told you he was drunk!\u0027 Spots of color had begun to creep into her cheeks. \u0027They don\u0027t give you a breathalyzer test if you\u0027re sober! His wife died! It was just like that Chappaquiddick business! Just like it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going to move into town,\u0027 Susan said slowly. \u0027I\u0027ve been meaning to tell you. I should have done it a long time ago, Mom. For both of us. I was talking to Babs Griffen, and she says there\u0027s a nice little four-room place on Sister\u0027s Lane - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, she\u0027s offended!\u0027 Mrs Norton remarked to the air. \u0027Someone just spoiled her pretty picture of Mr Ben Big?shot Mears and she\u0027s just so mad she could spit.\u0027 This line had been particularly effective some years back.\\n\\n \u0027Mom, what\u0027s happened to you?\u0027 Susan asked a little despairingly. \u0027You never used to . . . to get this low - \u0027\\n\\n Ann Norton\u0027s head jerked up. Her knitting slid off her lap as she stood up, clapped her hands to Susan\u0027s shoulders, and gave her a smart shake.\\n\\n \u0027You listen to me! I won\u0027t have you running around like a common trollop with some sissy boy who\u0027s got your head all filled up with moonlight. Do you hear me?\u0027\\n\\n Susan slapped her across the face.\\n\\n Ann Norton\u0027s eyes blinked and then opened wide in stunned surprise. They looked at each other for a moment in silence, shocked. A tiny sound came and died in Susan\u0027s throat.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going upstairs,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll be out by Tuesday at the latest.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Floyd was here,\u0027 Mrs Norton said. Her face was still rigid from the slap. Her daughter\u0027s finger marks stood out in red, like exclamation points.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m through with Floyd,\u0027 Susan said tonelessly. \u0027Get used to the idea. Tell your harpy friend Mabel all about it on the telephone, why don\u0027t you? Maybe then it will seem real to you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Floyd loves you, Susan \u0027 This is . . . ruining him. He broke down and told me everything. He poured out his heart to me.\u0027 Her eyes shone with the memory of it. \u0027He broke down at the end and cried like a baby.\u0027\\n\\n Susan thought how unlike Floyd that was. She wondered if her mother could be making it up, and knew by her eyes that she was not.\\n\\n \u0027Is that what you want for me, mom? A crybaby? Or did you just fall in love with the idea of blond-haired grandchildren? I suppose I bother you - you can\u0027t feel your job is complete until you see me married and settled down to a good man you can put your thumb on. Settled down with a fellow who\u0027ll get me pregnant and turn me into a matron in a hurry. That\u0027s the scoop, isn\u0027t it? Well, what about what I want?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Susan, you don\u0027t know what you want.\u0027\\n\\n And she said it with such absolute, convinced certainty that for a moment Susan was tempted to believe her. An image came to her of herself and her mother, standing here in set positions, her mother by her rocker and she by the door; only they were tied together by a hank of green yarn, a cord that had grown frayed and weak from many restless tuggings. Image transformed into her mother in a nimrod\u0027s hat, the band sportily pierced with many different flies. Trying desperately to reel in a large trout wearing a yellow print shift. Trying to reel it in for the last time and pop it away in the wicker creel. But for what purpose? To mount it? To eat it?\\n\\n \u0027No, Mom. I know exactly what I want. Ben Mears.\u0027 She turned and went up the stairs.\\n\\n Her mother ran after her and called up shrilly: \u0027You can\u0027t get a room! You haven\u0027t any money!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got a hundred in checking and three hundred in savings,\u0027 Susan replied calmly. \u0027And I can get a job down at Spencer\u0027s, I think. Mr Labree has offered several times.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All he\u0027ll care about is looking up your dress,\u0027 Mrs Norton said, but her voice had gone down an octave. Much of her anger had left hey and she felt a little frightened.\\n\\n \u0027Let him,\u0027 Susan said. \u0027I\u0027ll wear bloomers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Honey, don\u0027t be mad.\u0027 She came two steps up the stairs. \u0027I only want what\u0027s best for - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Spare it, Mom. I\u0027m sorry I slapped you. That was awful of me. I do love you. But I\u0027m moving out. It\u0027s way past time. You must see that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think it over,\u0027 Mrs Norton said, now clearly sorry as well as frightened. \u0027I still don\u0027t think I spoke out of turn. That Ben Mears, I\u0027ve seen showboats like him before. All he\u0027s interested in is - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. No more.\u0027\\n\\n She turned away.\\n\\n Her mother came up another step and called after her: \u0027When Floyd left here he was in an awful state. He - \u0027\\n\\n But the door to Susan\u0027s room closed and cut off her words.\\n\\n She lay down on her bed - which had been decorated with stuffed toys and a poodle dog with a transistor radio in its belly not so long ago - and lay looking at the wall, trying not to think. There were a number of Sierra Club posters on the wall, but not so long ago she had been surrounded by posters clipped from Rolling Stone and Creem and Crawdaddy, pictures of her idols - Jim Morri?son and John Lennon and Dave van Ronk and Chuck Berry. The ghost of those days seemed to crowd in on her like bad time exposures of the mind.\\n\\n She could almost see the newsprint, standing out on the cheap pulp stock. GOING-PLACES YOUNG WRITER AND YOUNG WIFE INVOLVED IN \u0027MAYBE\u0027 MOTORCYCLE FATALITY. The rest in carefully couched innuendoes. Perhaps a picture taken at the scene by a local photographer, too gory for the local paper, just right for Mabel\u0027s kind.\\n\\n And the worst was that a seed of doubt had been planted Stupid. Did you think he was in cold storage before he came back here? That he came wrapped in a germ-proof cellophane bag, like a motel drinking glass? Stupid. Yet the seed had been planted. And for that she could feel something more than adolescent pique for her mother ?she could feel something black that bordered on hate.\\n\\n She shut the thoughts - not out but away - and put an arm over her face and drifted into an uncomfortable doze that was broken by the shrill of the telephone downstairs, then more sharply by her mother\u0027s voice calling, \u0027Susan! It\u0027s for you!\u0027 \\n\\n She went downstairs, noticing it was just after five-thirty\u0027. The sun was in the west. Mrs Norton was in the kitchen, beginning supper. Her father wasn\u0027t home yet.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Susan?\u0027 The voice was familiar, but she could not put a name to it immediately.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, who\u0027s this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eva Miller, Susan. I\u0027ve got some bad news.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Has something happened to Ben?\u0027 All the spit seemed to have gone out of her mouth. Her band came up and touched her throat. Mrs Norton had come to the kitchen door and was watching, a spatula held in one hand.\\n\\n \u0027Well, there was a fight. Floyd Tibbits showed up here this afternoon - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Floyd!\u0027\\n\\n Mrs Norton winced at her tone.\\n\\n \u0027 - and I said Mr Mears was sleeping. He said all right, just as polite as ever, but he was dressed awful funny. I asked him if he felt all right. He had on an old-fashioned overcoat and a funny hat and he kept his hands in his pockets. I never thought to mention it to Mr Mears when he got up. There\u0027s been so much excitement - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027What happened?\u0027 Susan nearly screamed.\\n\\n \u0027Well, Floyd beat him up,\u0027 Eva said unhappily. \u0027Right out in my parking lot. Sheldon Corson and Ed Craig went out and dragged him off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ben. Is Ben all right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I guess not.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 She was holding the phone very tightly.\\n\\n \u0027Floyd got in one last crack and sent Mr Mears back against that little foreign car of his, and he hit his head. Carl Foreman took him over to Cumberland Receiving, and he was unconscious. I don\u0027t know anything else. If you - \u0027\\n\\n She hung up, ran to the closet, and pulled her coat off the hanger.\\n\\n \u0027Susan, what is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That nice boy Floyd Tibbits,\u0027 Susan said, hardly aware that she had begun to cry. \u0027He\u0027s put Ben in the hospital.\u0027\\n\\n She ran out without waiting for a reply.\\n\\n 2\\n\\n She got to the hospital at six-thirty and sat in an uncomfort?able plastic contour chair, staring blankly at a copy of Good Housekeeping. And I\u0027m the only one, she thought. How damned awful. She had thought of calling Matt Burke, but the thought of the doctor coming back and finding her gone had stopped her.\\n\\n The minutes crawled by on the waiting room clock, and at ten minutes of seven, a doctor with a sheaf of papers in one hand stepped through the door and said, \u0027Miss Norton?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right. Is Ben all right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not an answerable question at this point.\u0027 He saw the dread come into her face and added: \u0027He seems to be, but we\u0027ll want him here for two or three days. He\u0027s got a hairline fracture, multiple bruises, contusions, and one hell of a black eye.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can I see him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not tonight. He\u0027s been sedated.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For a minute? Please? One minute?\u0027\\n\\n He sighed. \u0027You can look in on him, if you like. He\u0027ll probably be asleep. I don\u0027t want you to say anything to him unless he speaks to you.\u0027\\n\\n He took her up to the third floor and then down to a room at the far end of a medicinal-smelling corridor. The man in the other bed was reading a magazine and looked up at them desultorily.\\n\\n Ben was lying with his eyes closed, a sheet pulled up to his chin. He was so pale and still that for one terrified moment Susan was sure he was dead; that he had just slipped away while she and the doctor had been talking downstairs. Then she marked the slow, steady rise and fall of his chest and felt a relief so great that she swayed a little on her feet. She looked at his face closely, hardly noticing the way it had been marked. Sissy boy, her mother had called him, and Susan could see how she might have gotten that idea. His features were strong but sensitive (she wished there was a better word than \u0027sensitive\u0027; that was the word you used to describe the local librarian who wrote stilted Spenserian sonnets to daffodils in his spare time; but it was the only word that fit). Only his hair seemed virile in the traditional sense. Black and heavy, it seemed almost to float above his face. The white bandage on the left side above the temple stood out in sharp, telling contrast.\\n\\n I love the man, she thought. Get well, Ben. Get well and finish your book so we can go away from the Lot together, if you want me. The Lot has turned bad for both of us.\\n\\n \u0027I think you\u0027d better leave now,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027Per?haps tomorrow - \u0027\\n\\n Ben stirred and made a thick sound in his throat. His eyelids opened slowly, closed, opened again. His eyes were dark with sedation, but the knowledge of her pre?sence was in them. He moved his hand over hers. Tears spilled out of her eyes and she smiled and squeezed his hand.\\n\\n He moved his lips and she bent to hear.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re real killers in this town, aren\u0027t they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ben, I\u0027m so sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think I knocked out two of his teeth before he decked me,\u0027 Ben whispered. \u0027Not bad for a writer fella.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ben - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think that will be enough, Mr Mears,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027Give the airplane glue a chance to set.\u0027\\n\\n Ben shifted his eyes to the doctor. \u0027Just a minute.\u0027 The doctor rolled his eyes. \u0027That\u0027s what she said.\u0027 Ben\u0027s eyelids slipped down again, then came up with difficulty. He said something unintelligible.\\n\\n Susan bent closer. \u0027What, darling?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is it dark yet?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Want you to go see . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Matt?\u0027\\n\\n He nodded. \u0027Tell him . . . I said for you to be told everything. Ask him if he . . . knows Father Callahan. He\u0027ll understand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 Susan said. \u0027I\u0027ll give him the message. You sleep now. Sleep well, Ben.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Kay. Love you.\u0027 He muttered something else, twice, and then his eyes closed. His breathing deepened.\\n\\n \u0027What did he say?\u0027 the doctor asked.\\n\\n Susan was frowning. \u0027It sounded like \"Lock the win?dows,\"\u0027 she said.\\n\\n 3\\n\\n Eva Miller and Weasel Craig were in the waiting room when she went back to get her coat. Eva was wearing an old fall coat with a rusty fur collar, obviously kept for best, and Weasel was floating in an outsized motorcycle jacket. Susan warmed at the sight of both of them.\\n\\n \u0027How is he?\u0027 Eva asked.\\n\\n \u0027Going to be all right, I think.\u0027 She repeated the doctor\u0027s diagnosis, and Eva\u0027s face relaxed.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m so glad. Mr Mears seems like a very nice man. Nothing like this has ever happened at my place. And Parkins Gillespie had to lock Floyd up in the drunk tank. He didn\u0027t act drunk, though. Just sort of dopey and confused.\u0027\\n\\n Susan shook her head. \u0027It doesn\u0027t sound like Floyd at all.\u0027\\n\\n There was a moment of uncomfortable silence.\\n\\n \u0027Ben\u0027s a lovely fella,\u0027 Weasel said, and patted Susan\u0027s hand. \u0027He\u0027ll be up and about in no time. You wait and see.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure he will be,\u0027 Susan said, and squeezed his hand in both of hers. \u0027Eva, isn\u0027t Father Callahan the priest at St Andrew\u0027s?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh . . . curious. Listen, thank you both for coming. If you could come back tomorrow - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll do that,\u0027 Weasel said. \u0027Sure we will, won\u0027t we, Eva?\u0027 He slipped an arm about her waist. It was a long reach, but he got there eventually.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, we will.\u0027\\n\\n Susan walked out to the parking lot with them and then drove back to Jerusalem\u0027s Lot.\\n\\n 4\\n\\n Matt did not answer at her knock or yell Come in! as he usually did. Instead, a very careful voice which she hardly recognized said, \u0027Who is it?\u0027 very quietly from the other side.\\n\\n \u0027Susie Norton, Mr Burke.\u0027\\n\\n He opened the door and she felt real shock at the change in him. He looked old and haggard. A moment after that, she saw that he was wearing a heavy gold crucifix. There was something so strange and ludicrous about that ornate five-and-dime corpus lying against his checked flannel shirt that she almost laughed - but didn\u0027t.\\n\\n \u0027Come in. Where\u0027s Ben?\u0027\\n\\n She told him and his face grew long. \u0027So Floyd Tibbits of all people decides to play wronged lover, is that it? Well, it couldn\u0027t have happened at a more inopportune time. Mike Ryerson was brought back from Portland late this afternoon for burial preparations at Foreman\u0027s. And I suppose our trip up to the Marsten House will have to be put off - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027What trip? What\u0027s this about Mike?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Would you like coffee?\u0027 he asked absently.\\n\\n \u0027No. I want to find out what\u0027s going on. Ben said you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That,\u0027 he said, \u0027is a very tall order. Easy for Ben to say I\u0027m to tell you everything. Harder to do. But I will try.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What - \u0027\\n\\n He held up one hand. \u0027One thing first, Susan. You and your mother went down to the new shop the other day.\u0027 Susan\u0027s brow furrowed. \u0027Sure. Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you give me your impressions of the place, and more specifically, of the man who runs it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mr Straker?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, he\u0027s quite charming,\u0027 she said. \u0027Courtly might be an even better word. He complimented Glynis Mayberry on her dress and she blushed like a schoolgirl. And asked Mrs Boddin about the bandage on her arm she spilled some hot fat on it, you know. He gave her a recipe for a poultice. Wrote it right down. And when Mabel came in . . .\u0027 She laughed a bit at the memory.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He got her a chair,\u0027 Susan said. \u0027Not a chair, actually, but a chair. More like a throne. A great carved mahogany thing. He brought it out of the back room all by himself, smiling and chatting with the other ladies all the time. But it must have weighed at least three hundred pounds. He plonked it down in the middle of the floor and escorted Mabel to it. Took her arm, you know. And she was giggling. If you\u0027ve seen Mabel giggling, you\u0027ve seen everything. And he served coffee. Very strong but very good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you like him?\u0027 Matt asked, watching her closely.\\n\\n \u0027This is all a part of it, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027It might be, yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, then. I\u0027ll give you a woman\u0027s reaction. I did and I didn\u0027t. I was attracted to him in a mildly sexual way, I guess. Older man, very urbane, very charming, very courtly. You know looking at him that he could order from a French menu and know what wine would go with what, not just red or white but the year and even the vineyard. Very definitely not the run of fellow you see around here. But not effeminate in the least. Lithe, like a dancer. And of course there\u0027s something attractive about a man who is so unabashedly bald.\u0027 She smiled a little defensively, knowing there was color in her cheeks, wondering if she had said more than she intended.\\n\\n \u0027But then you didn\u0027t,\u0027 Matt said.\\n\\n She shrugged. \u0027That\u0027s harder to put my finger on. I think . . . I think I sensed a certain contempt under the surface. A cynicism. As if he were playing a certain part, and playing it well, but as if he knew he wouldn\u0027t have to pull out all the stops to fool us. A touch of condescension.\u0027 She looked at him uncertainly. \u0027And there seemed to be something a little bit cruel about him. I don\u0027t really know why.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did anyone buy anything?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Not much, but he didn\u0027t seem to mind. Mom bought a little knickknack shelf from Yugoslavia \u0027 and that Mrs Petrie bought a lovely little drop-leaf table, but that was all I saw. He didn\u0027t seem to mind. Just urged people to tell their friends he was open, to come back by and not be strangers. Very Old World charming.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And do you think people were charmed?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027By and large, yes,\u0027 Susan said, mentally comparing her mother\u0027s enthusiastic impression of R. T. Straker to her immediate dislike of Ben.\\n\\n \u0027You didn\u0027t see his partner?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mr Barlow? No, he\u0027s in New York, on a buying trip.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is he?\u0027 Matt said, speaking to himself. \u0027I wonder. The elusive Mr Barlow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mr Burke, don\u0027t you think you better tell me what all this is about?\u0027\\n\\n He sighed heavily.\\n\\n \u0027I suppose I must try. What you\u0027ve just told me is disturbing. Very disturbing. It all fits so well . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027What? What does?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have to start,\u0027 he began, \u0027with meeting Mike Ryerson in Dell\u0027s tavern last night . . . which already seems a century ago.\u0027\\n\\n 5\\n\\n It was twenty after eight by the time he had finished, and they had both drunk two cups of coffee.\\n\\n \u0027I believe that\u0027s everything,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027And now shall I do my Napoleon imitation? Tell you about my astral conversations with Toulouse-Lautrec?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be silly,\u0027 she said. \u0027There\u0027s something going on, but not what you think. You must know that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I did until last night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If no one has it in for you, as Ben suggested, then maybe Mike did it himself. In a delirium or something. That sounded thin, but she pushed ahead anyway. \u0027Or maybe you fell asleep without knowing and dreamed the whole thing. I\u0027ve dozed off without knowing it before and lost a whole fifteen or twenty minutes.\u0027\\n\\n He shrugged tiredly. \u0027How does a person defend testi?mony no rational mind will accept at face value? I heard what I heard. I was not asleep. And something has me worried . . . rather badly worried. According to the old literature, a vampire cannot simply walk into a man\u0027s house and suck his blood. No. He has to be invited. But Mike Ryerson invited Danny Glick in last night. And I invited Mike myself!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Matt, has Ben told you about his new book?\u0027\\n\\n He fiddled with his pipe but didn\u0027t light it. \u0027Very little. Only that it\u0027s somehow connected with the Marsten House.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Has he told you he had a very traumatic experience in the Marsten House as a boy?\u0027\\n\\n He looked up sharply. \u0027In it? No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He went in on a dare. He wanted to join a club, and the initiation was for him to go into the Marsten House and bring something out. He did, as a matter of fact - but before he left, he went up to the second-floor bedroom where Hubie Marsten hung himself. When he opened the door, he saw Hubie hanging there. He opened his eyes. Ben ran. That\u0027s festered in him for twenty-four years. He came back to the Lot to try to write it out of his system.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Christ,\u0027 Matt said.\\n\\n \u0027He has . . . a certain theory about the Marsten House. It springs partly from his own experience and partly from some rather amazing research he\u0027s done on Hubert Marsten - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027His penchant for devil worship?\u0027\\n\\n She started. \u0027How did you know that.\u0027\\n\\n He smiled a trifle grimly. \u0027Not all the gossip in a small town is open gossip. There are secrets. Some of the secret gossip in \u0027salem\u0027s Lot has to do with Hubie Marsten. It\u0027s shared among perhaps only a dozen or so of the older people now - Mabel Werts is one of them. It was a long time ago, Susan. But even so, there is no statute of limitations on some stories. It\u0027s strange, you know. Even Mabel won\u0027t talk about Hubert Marsten with anyone but her own circle. They\u0027ll talk about his death, of course. About the murder. But if you ask about the ten years he and his wife spent up there in their house, doing God knows what, a sort of governor comes into play - perhaps the closest thing to a taboo our Western civilization knows. There have even been whispers that Hubert Marsten kid?napped and sacrificed small children to his infernal gods. I\u0027m surprised Ben found out as much as he did. The secrecy concerning that aspect of Hubie and his wife and his house is almost tribal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He didn\u0027t come by it in the Lot.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That explains it, then. I suspect his theory is a rather old parapsychological wheeze - that humans manufacture evil just as they manufacture snot or excrement or finger?nail parings. That it doesn\u0027t go away. Specifically, that the Marsten House may have become a kind of evil dry-cell; a malign storage battery.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. He expressed it in exactly those terms.\u0027 She looked at him wonderingly.\\n\\n He gave a dry chuckle. \u0027We\u0027ve read the same books. And what do you think, Susan? Is there more than heaven and earth in your philosophy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said with quiet firmness. \u0027Houses are only houses. Evil dies with the perpetration of evil acts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re suggesting that Ben\u0027s instability may enable me to lead him down the path to insanity that I am already traversing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, of course not. I don\u0027t think you\u0027re insane. But Mr Burke, you must realize - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Be quiet.\u0027\\n\\n He had cocked his head forward. She stopped talking and listened. Nothing . . . except perhaps a creaky board. She looked at him questioningly, and he shook his head. \u0027You were saying?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Only that coincidence has made this a poor time for him to exorcise the demons of his youth. There\u0027s been a lot of cheap talk going around town since the Marsten House reoccupied and that store was opened . . . there\u0027s been talk about Ben himself, for that matter. Rites of exorcism have been known to get out of hand and turn on the exorcist. I think Ben needs to get out of this town and I think maybe you could use a vacation from it, Mr Burke.\u0027\\n\\n Exorcism made her think of Ben\u0027s request to mention the Catholic priest to Matt. On impulse, she decided not to. The reason he had asked was now clear enough, but it would only be adding fuel to a fire that was, in her opinion, already dangerously high. When Ben asked her - if he ever did - she would say she had forgotten.\\n\\n \u0027I know how mad it must sound,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027Even to me, who heard the window go up, and that laugh, and saw the screen lying beside the driveway this morning. But if it will allay your fears any, I must say that Ben\u0027s reaction to the whole thing was very sensible. He suggested we put the thing on the basis of a theory to be proved or disproved, and begin by - \u0027 He ceased again, listening.\\n\\n This time the silence spun out, and when he spoke again, the soft certainty in his voice frightened her. \u0027There\u0027s someone upstairs.\u0027\\n\\n She listened. Nothing.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re imagining things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know my house,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027Someone is in the guest bedroom . . . there, you hear?\u0027\\n\\n And this time she did hear. The audible creak of a board, creaking the way boards in old houses do, for no good reason at all. But to Susan\u0027s ears there seemed to be something more - something unutterably sly - in that sound.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going upstairs,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027\\n\\n The word came out with no thought. She told herself: Now who\u0027s sitting in the chimney corner, believing the wind in the eaves is a banshee?\\n\\n \u0027I was frightened last night and did nothing and things grew worse. Now I am going upstairs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mr Burke - \u0027\\n\\n They had both begun to speak in undertones. Tension into her veins, making her muscles stiff. Maybe there was someone upstairs. A prowler.\\n\\n \u0027Talk,\u0027 he said. \u0027After I go, continue speaking. On any subject.\u0027\\n\\n And before she could argue, he was out of his seat and moving toward the hall, moving with a grace that was nearly astounding. He looked back once, but she couldn\u0027t read his eyes. He began to go up the stairs.\\n\\n Her mind felt dazed into unreality by the swift turn?around things had taken. Less than two minutes ago they had been discussing this business calmly, under the rational light of electric bulbs. And now she was afraid. Question: If you put a psychologist in a room with a man who thinks he\u0027s Napoleon and leave them there for a year (or ten or twenty), will you end up with two Skinner men or two guys with their hands in their shirts? Answer: Insufficient data.\\n\\n She opened her mouth and said, \u0027Ben and I were going to drive up Route 1 to Camden on Sunday - you know, the town where they filmed Peyton Place - but now I guess we\u0027ll have to wait. They have the most darling little church . . . \u0027\\n\\n She found herself droning along with great facility, even though her hands were clenched together in her lap tightly enough to whiten the knuckles. Her mind was clear, still unimpressed with this talk of bloodsuckers and the undead. It was from her spinal cord, a much older network of nerves and ganglia, that the black dread emanated in waves.\\n\\n 6\\n\\n Going up the stairs was the hardest thing Matt Burke had ever done in his life. That was all; that was it. Nothing else even came close. Except perhaps one thing.\\n\\n As a boy of eight, he had been in a Cub Scout pack. ?The den mother\u0027s house was a mile up the road and going was fine, yes, excellent, because you walked in the late afternoon daylight. But coming home twilight had begun to fall, freeing the shadows to yawn across the road in long, twisty patterns - or, if the meeting was particularly enthusiastic and ran late, you had to walk home in the dark. Alone.\\n\\n Alone. Yes, that\u0027s the key word, the most awful word in the English tongue. Murder doesn\u0027t hold a candle to it and hell is only a poor synonym. . . .\\n\\n There was a ruined church along the way, an old Methodist meeting house, which reared its shambles at the far end of a frost-heaved and hummocked lawn, and when you walked past the view of its glaring, senseless windows your footsteps became very loud in your ears and whatever you had been whistling died on your lips and you thought about how it must be inside - the overturned pews, the rotting hymnals, the crumbling altar where only mice now kept the sabbath, and you wondered what might be in there besides mice - what madmen, what monsters. Maybe they were peering out at you with yellow reptilian eyes. And maybe one night watching would not be enough; maybe some night that splintered, crazily hung door would be thrown open, and what you saw standing there would drive you to lunacy at one look.\\n\\n And you couldn\u0027t explain that to your mother and father, who were creatures of the light. No more than you could explain to them how, at the age of three, the spare blanket at the foot of the crib turned into a collection of snakes that lay staring at you with flat and lidless eyes. No child ever conquers those fears, he thought. If a fear cannot be articulated, it can\u0027t be conquered. And the fears locked in small brains are much too large to pass through the orifice of the mouth. Sooner or later you found someone to walk past all the deserted meeting houses you had to pass between grinning babyhood and grunting senility, Until tonight. Until tonight when you found out that none of the old fears had been staked - only tucked away in their tiny, child-sized coffins with a wild rose on top.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t turn on the light. He mounted the steps, one by one avoiding the sixth, which creaked. He held on to the crucifix, and his palm was sweaty and slick.\\n\\n He reached the top and turned soundlessly to took down ?the hall. The guest room door was ajar. He had left it shut. From downstairs came the steady murmur of Susan\u0027s voice.\\n\\n Walking carefully to avoid squeaks, be went down to the door and stood in front of it. The basis of all human fears, he thought. A closed door, slightly ajar.\\n\\n He reached out and pushed it open.\\n\\n Mike Ryerson was lying on the bed.\\n\\n Moonlight flooded in the windows and silvered the room, turning it into a lagoon of dreams. Matt shook his head, as if to clear it. Almost it seemed as though he had moved backward in time, that it was the night before. He would go downstairs and call Ben because Ben wasn\u0027t in the hospital yet -\\n\\n Mike opened his eyes.\\n\\n They glittered for just a moment in the moonlight, silver rimmed with red. They were as blank as washed black?boards. There was no human thought or feeling in them. The eyes are the windows of the soul, Wordsworth had said. If so, these windows looked in on an empty room.\\n\\n Mike sat up, the sheet failing from his chest, and Matt saw the heavy industrial stitchwork where the ME or pathologist had repaired the work of his autopsy, perhaps whistling as he sewed.\\n\\n Mike smiled, and his canines and incisors were white and sharp. The smile itself was a mere flexing of the muscles around the mouth; it never touched the eyes. They retained their original dead blankness.\\n\\n Mike said very clearly, \u0027Look at me.\u0027\\n\\n Matt looked. Yes, the eyes were utterly blank. But very deep. You could almost see little silver cameos of yourself in those eyes, drowning sweetly, making the world seem unimportant, making fears seem unimportant -\\n\\n ?He stepped backward and cried out, \u0027No! No!\u0027\\n\\n And held the crucifix out.\\n\\n Whatever had been Mike Ryerson hissed as if hot water had been thrown in its face. Its arms went up as if to ward off a blow. Matt took a step into the room; Ryerson took a compensatory one backward.\\n\\n \u0027Get out of here!\u0027 Matt croaked. \u0027I revoke my invitation!\u0027\\n\\n Ryerson screamed, a high, ululating sound full of hate and pain. He took four shambling steps backward. The backs of the knees struck the ledge of the open window, and Ryerson tottered past the edge of balance.\\n\\n \u0027I will see you sleep like the dead, teacher.\u0027\\n\\n It fell outward into the night, going backward with its hands thrown out above its head, like a diver going off a high board. The pallid body gleamed like marble, in hard and depthless contrast to the black stitches that crisscrossed the torso in a Y pattern.\\n\\n Matt let out a crazed, terrified wail and rushed to the window and peered out. There was nothing to be seen but the moon-gilded night - and suspended in the air below the window and above the spill of light that marked the living room, a dancing pattern of motes that might have been dust. They whirled, coalesced in a pattern that was hideously humanoid, and then dissipated into nothing.\\n\\n He turned to run, and that was when the pain filled his chest and made him stagger. He clutched at it and doubled over. The pain seemed to be coming up his arm in steady, pulsing waves. The crucifix swung below his eyes.\\n\\n He walked out the door holding his forearms crossed before his chest, the chain of the crucifix still caught in his right hand. The image of Mike Ryerson hanging in the dark air like some pallid high-diver hung before him.\\n\\n \u0027Mr Burke!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My doctor is James Cody,\u0027 he said through lips that were as cold as snow. \u0027It\u0027s on the phone reminder. I\u0027m having a heart attack, I think.\u0027\\n\\n He collapsed in the upper hall, face down.\\n\\n 7\\n\\n She dialed the number marked beside JIMMY CODY, PILLPUSHER. The legend was written in the neat block capitals she remembered so well from her school days. A woman\u0027s voice answered and Susan said, \u0027Is the doctor home? Emergency!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 the woman said calmly. \u0027Here he is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dr Cody speaking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is Susan Norton. I\u0027m at Mr Burke\u0027s house. He\u0027s had a heart attack.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who? Matt Burke?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. He\u0027s unconscious. What should I -\\n\\n \u0027Call an ambulance,\u0027 he said. \u0027In Cumberland that\u0027s 841-4000. Stay with him. Put a blanket over him but don\u0027t move him. Do you understand?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll be there in twenty minutes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will you - \u0027\\n\\n But the phone clicked, and she was alone.\\n\\n She called for an ambulance and then she was alone again, faced with going back upstairs to him.\\n\\n 8\\n\\n She stared at the stairwell with a trepidation which was amazing to her. She found herself wishing that none of it had happened, not so that Matt could be all right, but so she would not have to feel this sick, shaken fear. Her unbelief had been total - she saw Matt\u0027s perceptions of the previous night as something to be defined in terms of her accepted realities, nothing more or less. And now that firm unbelief was gone from beneath her and she felt herself falling.\\n\\n She had heard Matt\u0027s voice and had heard a terrible toneless incantation: I will see you sleep like the dead, teacher. The voice that had spoken those words had no more human quality than a dog\u0027s bark.\\n\\n She went back upstairs, forcing her body through every step. Even the hall light did not help much. Matt lay where she had left him, his face turned sideways so the right cheek lay against the threadbare nap of the hall runner, breathing in harsh, tearing gasps. She bent and undid the top two buttons of his shirt and his breathing seemed to ease a little. Then she went into the guest bedroom to get a blanket.\\n\\n The room was cool. The window stood open. The bed had been stripped except for the mattress pad, but there were blankets stacked on the top shelf of the closet. As she turned back to the hall something on the floor near the window glittered in the moonlight and she stooped and picked it up. She recognized it immediately. A Cumber?land Consolidated High School class ring. The initials engraved on the inner curve were MCR\\n\\n Michael Corey Ryerson.\\n\\n For the moment, in the dark, she believed. She believed it all. A scream rose in her throat and she choked it unvoiced, but the ring tumbled from her fingers and lay on the floor below the window, glinting in the moonlight that rode the autumn dark. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/salem-s-lot/page-11.html","bookId":2573,"book":{"id":2573,"title":"\u0027Salem\u0027s Lot","description":"Storyline: Something strange is going on in Jerusalem\u0027s Lot ... but no one dares to talk about it.
