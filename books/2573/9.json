{"id":93271,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"1\\n\\n At the end of period three on Tuesday, Matt walked up to the office and Ben Mears was there waiting for him.\\n\\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027You\u0027re early.\u0027\\n\\n Ben stood up and shook hands. \u0027Family curse, I guess. Say, these kids aren\u0027t going to eat me, are they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Positive,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027Come on.\u0027\\n\\n He was a little surprised. Ben had dressed in a nice-?looking sport coat an a pair of gray double-knit slacks. Good shoes that looked as if they hadn\u0027t been worn much. Matt had had other literary types into his classes and they were usually dressed in casual clothes or something downright weird. A year ago he had asked a rather well known female poet who had done a reading at the Univer?sity of Maine at Portland if she would come in the following day and talk to a class about poetry. She had shown up in pedal pushers and high heels. It seemed to be a subcon?scious way of saying: Look at me, I\u0027ve beaten the system at its own game. I come and go like the wind.\\n\\n His admiration for Ben went up a notch in comparison. After thirty-plus years of teaching, he believed that nobody beat the system or won the game, and only suckers ever thought they were ahead.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a nice building,\u0027 Ben said, looking around as they walked down the hall. \u0027Helluva lot different from where I went to high school. Most of the windows in that place looked like loopholes.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027First mistake,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027You must never call it a building. It\u0027s a \"plant\". Blackboards are \"visual aids\". And the kids are a \"homogenous mid-teen coeducational student body\".\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How wonderful for them,\u0027 Ben said, grinning.\\n\\n \u0027It is, isn\u0027t it? Did you go to college, Ben?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I tried. Liberal arts. But everybody seemed to be play?ing an intellectual game of capture-the-flag - you too can find an ax and grind it, thus becoming known and loved. Also, I flunked out. When Conway\u0027s Daughter sold, I was bucking cases of Coca-Cola onto delivery trucks.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell the kids that. They\u0027ll be interested.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You like teaching?\u0027 Ben said.\\n\\n \u0027Sure I like it. It would have been a busted-axle forty years if I didn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n The late bell rang, echoing loudly in the corridor, which was empty now except for one loitering student who was wandering slowly past a painted arrow under a sign which read \u0027Wood Shop\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027How\u0027s drugs here?\u0027 Ben asked.\\n\\n \u0027All kinds. Like every school in America. Ours is booze more than anything else.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not marijuana?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t consider pot a problem and neither does the administration, when it speaks off the record with a few knocks of Jim Beam under its belt. I happen to know that our guidance counselor, who is one of the best in his line, isn\u0027t averse to toking up and going to a movie. I\u0027ve tried it myself. The effect is fine, but it gives me acid indigestion.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You have?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shhh,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027Big Brother is listening everywhere. Besides, this is my room.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh boy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be nervous,\u0027 Matt said, and led him in. \u0027Good morning, folks,\u0027 he said to the twenty or so students, who were eying Ben closely. \u0027This is Mr Ben Mears.\u0027\\n\\n 2\\n\\n At first Ben thought he had the wrong house.\\n\\n When Matt Burke invited him for supper he was quite sure he had said the house was the small gray one after the red brick, but there was rock \u0027n\u0027 roll music pouring from this one in a steady stream.\\n\\n He used the tarnished brass knocker, got no answer, and rapped again. This time the music was turned down and a voice that was unmistakably Matt\u0027s yelled, \u0027It\u0027s open! Come on in!\u0027\\n\\n He did, looking around curiously. The front door opened directly on a small living room furnished in Early American Junk Shop and dominated by an incredibly ancient Motorola TV. A KLH sound system with quad speakers was putting out the music.\\n\\n Matt came out of the kitchen, outfitted in a red-and?white-checked apron. The odor of spaghetti sauce wand?ered out after him.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry about the noise,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027I\u0027m a little deaf. I turn it up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good music.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been a rock fan ever since Buddy Holly. Lovely music. Are you hungry?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027Thanks again for asking me. I\u0027ve eaten out more since I came back to \u0027salem\u0027s Lot than I have in the last five years, I guess.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a friendly town. Hope you don\u0027t mind eating in the kitchen. An antique man came by a couple of months ago and offered me two hundred dollars for my dining room table. I haven\u0027t gotten around to getting another one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t mind. I\u0027m a kitchen eater from a long line of kitchen eaters.\u0027\\n\\n The kitchen was astringently neat. On the small four-?burner stove, a pot of spaghetti sauce simmered and a colander full of spaghetti stood steaming. A small drop-leaf table was set with a couple of mismatched plates and glasses which had animated cartoon figures dancing around the rims - jelly glasses, Ben thought with amusement. The last constraint of being with a stranger dropped away and he began to feel at home.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s Bourbon, rye, and vodka in the cupboard over the sink,\u0027 Matt said, pointing. \u0027There\u0027s some mixers in the fridge. Nothing too fancy, I\u0027m afraid.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bourbon and tap water will do me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go to it. I\u0027m going to serve this mess up.\u0027\\n\\n Mixing his drink, Ben said, \u0027I liked your kids. They asked good questions. Tough, but good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like where do you get your ideas?\u0027 Matt asked, mimick?ing Ruthie Crockett\u0027s sexy little-girl lisp.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s quite a piece.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She is indeed. There\u0027s a bottle of Lancers in the icebox behind the pineapple chunks. I got it special.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Say, you shouldn\u0027t - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh come, Ben. We hardly see best-selling authors in the Lot every day.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s a little extravagant.\u0027\\n\\n Ben finished the rest of his drink, took a plate of spaghetti from Matt, ladled sauce over it, and twirled a forkful against his spoon. \u0027Fantastic,\u0027 he said. \u0027Mamma mia.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But of course,\u0027 Matt said.\\n\\n Ben looked down at his plate, which had emptied with amazing rapidity. He wiped his mouth a little guiltily.\\n\\n \u0027More?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Half a plate, if it\u0027s okay. It\u0027s great spaghetti.\u0027\\n\\n Matt brought him a whole plate. \u0027If we don\u0027t eat it, my cat will. He\u0027s a miserable animal. Weighs twenty pounds and waddles to his dish.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lord, how did I miss him?\u0027\\n\\n Matt smiled. \u0027He\u0027s cruising. Is your new book a novel?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A fictionalized sort of thing,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027To be honest, I\u0027m writing it for money. Art is wonderful, but just once I\u0027d like to pull a big number out of the hat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are the prospects?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Murky,\u0027 Ben said.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s go in the living room,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027The chairs are lumpy but more comfortable than these kitchen horrors. Did you get enough to eat?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does the Pope wear a tall hat?\u0027\\n\\n In the living room Matt put on a stack of albums and went to work firing up a huge, knotted calabash pipe. After he had it going to his satisfaction (sitting in the middle of a huge raft of smoke), he looked up at Ben.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027You can\u0027t see it from here.\u0027\\n\\n Ben looked around sharply. \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Marsten House. I\u0027ll bet you a nickel that s what you were looking for.\u0027\\n\\n Ben laughed uneasily. \u0027No bet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is your book set in a town like \u0027salem\u0027s Lot?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Town and people,\u0027 Ben nodded. \u0027There are a series of sex murders and mutilations. I\u0027m going to open with one of them and describe it in progress, from start to finish, in minute detail. Rub the reader\u0027s nose in it. I was outlining that part when Ralphie Glick disappeared and it gave me . . . well, it gave me a nasty turn.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re basing all of this on the disappearances of the thirties in the township?\u0027\\n\\n Ben looked at him closely. \u0027You know about that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes. A good many of the older residents do, too. I wasn\u0027t in the Lot then, but Mabel Werts and Glynis May?berry and Milt Crossen were. Some of them have made the connection already.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What connection?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come now, Ben. The connection is pretty obvious, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n I suppose so. The last time the house was occupied, four kids disappeared over a period of ten years. Now it\u0027s occupied again after a thirty-six-year period, and Ralphie Glick disappears right off the bat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you think it\u0027s a coincidence?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose so,\u0027 Ben said cautiously. Susan\u0027s words of caution were very much in his ears. \u0027But it\u0027s funny. I checked through the copies of the Ledger from 1939 to 1970 just to get a comparison. Three kids disappeared. One ran off and was later found working in Boston - he was sixteen and looked older. Another one was fished out of the Androscoggin a month later. And one was found buried off Route 116 in Gates, apparently the victim of a hit-and-run. All explained.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps the Glick boy\u0027s disappearance will be ex?plained, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you don\u0027t think so. What do you know about this man Straker?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing at all,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027I\u0027m not even sure I want to meet him. I\u0027ve got a viable book working right now, and it\u0027s bound up in a certain concept of the Marsten House and inhabitants of that house. Discovering Straker to be a perfectly ordinary businessman, as I\u0027m sure he is, might knock me off kilter.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think that would be the case. He opened the store today, you know. Susie Norton and her mother dropped by, I understand . . . hell, most of the women in town got in long enough to get a peek. According to Dell Markey, an unimpeachable source, even Mabel Werts hobbled down. The man is supposed to be quite striking. A dandy dresser, extremely graceful, totally bald, And charming. I\u0027m told he actually sold some pieces.\u0027\\n\\n Ben grinned. \u0027Wonderful. Has anyone seen the other half of the team?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s on a buying trip, supposedly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why supposedly?\u0027\\n\\n Matt shrugged restlessly. \u0027I don\u0027t know. The whole thing is probably perfectly on the level, but the house makes me nervous. Almost as if the two of them had sought it out. As you said, it\u0027s like an idol, squatting there on top of its hill.\u0027\\n\\n Ben nodded.\\n\\n \u0027And on top of everything else, we have another child disappearance. And Ralphie\u0027s brother, Danny. Dead at twelve. Cause of death pernicious anemia.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s odd about that? It\u0027s unfortunate, of course - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027My doctor is a young fellow named Jimmy Cody, Ben. I had him in school. He was a little heller then, a good doctor now. This is gossip, mind you. Hearsay.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was in for a check-up, and happened to mention that it was a shame about the Glick boy, dreadful for his parents on top of the other one\u0027s vanishing act. Jimmy said he had consulted with George Gorby on the case. The boy was anemic, all right. He said that a red cell count on a boy Danny\u0027s age should run anywhere from eighty-five to ninety-eight per cent. Danny\u0027s was down to forty-five per cent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wow,\u0027 Ben said.\\n\\n \u0027They were giving him B12 injections and calf liver and it seemed to be working fine. They were going to release him the next day. And boom, he dropped dead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t want to let Mabel Werts get that,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027She\u0027ll be seeing natives with poison blowguns in the park.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I haven\u0027t mentioned it to anyone but you. And I don\u0027t intend to. And by the way, Ben, I believe I\u0027d keep the subject matter of your book quiet, if I were you. If Loretta Starcher asks what you\u0027re writing about, tell her it\u0027s archi?tecture.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve already been given that advice.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027By Susan Norton, no doubt.\u0027\\n\\n Ben looked at his watch and stood up. \u0027Speaking of Susan - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027The courting male in full plumage,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027As it happens, I have to go up to the school. We are reblocking the third act of the school play, a comedy of great social significance called Charley\u0027s Problem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What is his problem?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pimples,\u0027 Matt said, and grinned.\\n\\n They walked to the door together, Matt pausing to pull on a faded school letter jacket. Ben thought he had the figure of an aging track coach rather than that of a seden?tary English teacher - if you ignored his face, which was intelligent yet dreamy, and somehow innocent.\\n\\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 Matt said as they went out onto the stoop, \u0027what have you got on the stove for Friday night?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027I thought Susan and I might go to a movie. That\u0027s about the long and short of it around here.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I can think of something else,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027Perhaps we should form a committee of three and take a drive up to the Marsten House and introduce ourselves to the new squire. On behalf of the town, of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027It would be only common cour?tesy, wouldn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A rustic welcome wagon,\u0027 Matt agreed.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll mention it to Susan tonight. I think she\u0027ll go for it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good.\u0027\\n\\n Matt raised his hand and waved as Ben\u0027s Citro?n purred away. Ben tooted twice in acknowledgment, and then his taillights disappeared over the hill.\\n\\n Matt stood on his stoop for almost a full minute after the sound of the car had died away, his hands poked into his jacket pockets, his eyes turned toward the house on the hill.\\n\\n 3\\n\\n There was no play practice Thursday night, and Matt drove over to Dell\u0027s around nine o\u0027clock for two or three beers. If that damn snip Jimmy Cody wouldn\u0027t prescribe for his insomnia, he would prescribe for himself.\\n\\n Dell\u0027s was sparsely populated on nights when no band played. Matt saw only three people he knew: Weasel Craig, nursing a beer along in the corner; Floyd Tibbits, with thunderclouds on his brow (he had spoken to Susan three times this week, twice on the phone and once in person, in the Norton living room, and none of the conver?sations had gone well); and Mike Ryerson, who was sitting in one of the far booths against the wall.\\n\\n Matt walked over to the bar, where Dell Markey was polishing glasses and watching \u0027Ironside\u0027 on a portable TV.\\n\\n \u0027Hi, Matt. How\u0027s it going?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fair. Slow night.\u0027\\n\\n Dell shrugged. \u0027Yeah. They got a couple of motorcycle pictures over to the drive-in in Gates. I can\u0027t compete with that. Glass or pitcher?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Make it a pitcher.\u0027\\n\\n Dell drew it, cut the foam off, and added another two inches. Matt paid, and after a moment\u0027s hesitation, walked over to Mike\u0027s booth. Mike had filtered through one of Matt\u0027s English classes, like almost all the young people in the Lot, and Matt had enjoyed him. He had done above-average work with an average intelligence because he worked hard and had asked over and over about things he didn\u0027t understand until he got them. In addition to that, he had a clear, free-running sense of humor and a pleasant streak of individualism that made him a class favorite.\\n\\n \u0027Hi, Mike,\u0027 he said. \u0027Mind if I join you?\u0027\\n\\n Mike Ryerson looked up and Matt felt shock hit him like a live wire. His first reaction: Drugs. Heavy drugs.\\n\\n \u0027Sure, Mr Burke. Sit down.\u0027 His voice was listless. His complexion was a horrid, pasty white, darkening to deep shadows under his eyes. The eyes themselves seemed overlarge and hectic. His hands moved slowly across the table in the tavern\u0027s semigloom like ghosts. A glass of beer stood untouched before him.\\n\\n \u0027How are you doing, Mike?\u0027 Matt poured himself a glass of beer, controlling his hands \u0027 which wanted to shake.\\n\\n His life had always been one of sweet evenness, a graph with modulate highs and lows (and even those had sunk to foothills since the death of his mother thirteen years before), and one of the things that disturbed it was the miserable ends some of his students came to. Billy Royko dying in a Vietnam helicopter crash two months before the cease-fire; Sally Greer, one of the brightest and most vivacious girls he had ever had, killed by her drunken boy friend when she told him she wanted to break up; Gary Coleman, who had gone blind due to some mysterious optic nerve degeneration; Buddy Mayberry\u0027s brother Doug, the only good kid in that whole half-bright clan, drowning at Old Orchard Beach; and drugs, the little death. Not all of them who waded into the waters of Lethe found it necessary to take a bath in it, but there were enough - kids who had made dreams their protein.\\n\\n \u0027Doing?\u0027 Mike said slowly. \u0027I don\u0027t know, Mr Burke. Not so good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What kind of shit are you on, Mike?\u0027 Matt asked gently.\\n\\n Mike looked at him uncomprehendingly.\\n\\n \u0027Dope,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027Bennies? Reds? Coke? Or is it - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not on dope,\u0027 Mike said. \u0027I guess I\u0027m sick.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is that the truth?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I never did no heavy dope in my life,\u0027 Mike said, and the words seemed to be costing him a dreadful effort. \u0027Just grass, and I ain\u0027t had any of that for four months. I\u0027m sick . . . been sick since Monday, I think it was. I fell asleep out at Harmony Hill Sunday night, see. Never even woke up until Monday morning.\u0027 He shook his head slowly. \u0027I felt crappy. I\u0027ve felt crappy ever since. Worse every day, it seems like.\u0027 He sighed, and the whistle of air seemed to shake his frame like a dead leaf on a November maple.\\n\\n Matt leaned forward, concerned. \u0027This happened after Danny Glick\u0027s funeral?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027 Mike looked at him again. \u0027I came back to finish up after everybody went home but that fucking - excuse me, Mr Burke - that Royal Snow never showed up. I waited for him a long time, and that\u0027s when I must have started to get sick, because everything after that is . . . oh, it hurts my head. It\u0027s hard to think.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you remember, Mike?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Remember?\u0027 Mike looked into the golden depths of his beer glass and watched the bubbles detaching themselves from the sides and floating to the surface to release their gas.\\n\\n \u0027I remember singing,\u0027 he said. \u0027The sweetest singing I ever heard. And a feeling like . . . like drowning. Only it was nice. Except for the eyes. The eyes.\u0027\\n\\n He clutched his elbows and shuddered.\\n\\n \u0027Whose eyes?\u0027 Matt asked, leaning forward.\\n\\n \u0027They were red. Oh, scary eyes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whose?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t remember. No eyes. I dreamed it all.\u0027 He pushed it away from himself. Matt could almost see him do it. \u0027I don\u0027t remember anything else about Sunday night. I woke up Monday morning on the ground, and at first I couldn\u0027t even get up I was so tired. But I finally did. The sun was coming up and I was afraid I\u0027d get a sunburn. So I went down in the woods by the brook. Tired me out. Oh, awful tired. So I went back to sleep. Slept till . . . oh, four or five o\u0027clock.\u0027 He offered a papery little chuckle. \u0027I was all covered with leaves when I woke up. I felt a little better, though. I got up and went back to my truck.\u0027 He passed a slow hand over his face. \u0027I must have finished up with the little Glick boy Sunday night, though. Funny. I don\u0027t even remember.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Finished up?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Grave was all filled in, Royal or no Royal. Sods tamped in and all. A good job. Don\u0027t remember doing it. Must have been really sick.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where did you spend Monday night?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027At my place. Where else?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How did you feel Tuesday morning?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I never woke up Tuesday morning. Slept through the whole day. Never woke up until Tuesday night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How did you feel then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Terrible. Legs like rubber. I tried to go get a drink of water and almost fell down. I had to go into the kitchen holding on to things. Weak as a kitten.\u0027 He frowned. \u0027I had a can of stew for my dinner - you know, that Dinty Moore stuff - but I couldn\u0027t eat it. Seemed like just looking at it made me feel sick to my stomach. Like when you\u0027ve got an awful hangover and someone shows you food.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You didn\u0027t eat anything?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I tried, but I threw it up. But I felt a little better. I went out and walked around for a while. Then I went back to bed.\u0027 His fingers traced old beer rings on the table. \u0027I got scared before I went to bed. Just like a little kid afraid of the Allamagoosalum. I went around and made sure all the windows were locked. And I went to sleep with all the lights on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And yesterday morning?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmmm? No . . . never got up until nine o\u0027clock last night.\u0027 He offered the papery little chuckle again. \u0027I remember thinking if it kept up I\u0027d be sleeping the clock right around. And that\u0027s what you do when you\u0027re dead.\u0027 Matt regarded him somberly. Floyd Tibbits got up and put a quarter in the juke and began to punch up songs.\\n\\n \u0027Funny,\u0027 Mike said. \u0027My bedroom window was open when I got up. I must have done it myself. I had a dream . . . someone was at the window and I got up . . . got up to let him in. Like you\u0027d get up to let in an old friend who was cold or . . . or hungry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who was it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was just a dream, Mr Burke.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But in the dream who was it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I was going to try and eat, but the thought of it made me want to puke.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What did you do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I watched TV until Johnny Carson went off. I felt a lot better. Then I went to bed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you lock the windows?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And slept all day?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I woke up around sundown.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Weak?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I hope to tell.\u0027 He passed a hand over his face. I feel so low!\u0027 he cried out in a breaking voice. \u0027It\u0027s just the flu or something, isn\u0027t it, Mr Burke? I\u0027m not really sick, am I?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Matt said.\\n\\n \u0027I thought a few beers would cheer me up, but I can\u0027t drink it. I took one sip and it like to gag me. The last week . . . it all seems like a bad dream. And I\u0027m scared. I\u0027m awful scared.\u0027 He put his thin hands to his face and Matt saw that he was crying.\\n\\n \u0027Mike?\u0027\\n\\n No response.\\n\\n \u0027Mike.\u0027 Gently, he pulled Mike\u0027s hands away from his face. \u0027I want you to come home with me tonight. I want you to sleep in my guest room. Will you do that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right. I don\u0027t care.\u0027 He wiped his sleeve across his eyes with lethargic slowness. \\n\\n \u0027And tomorrow I want you to come see Dr Cody with me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on. Let\u0027s go.\u0027\\n\\n He thought of calling Ben Mears and didn\u0027t.\\n\\n 4\\n\\n When Matt knocked on the door, Mike Ryerson said, \u0027Come in.\u0027\\n\\n Matt came in with a pair of pajamas. \u0027These are going to be a little big - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s all right, Mr Burke. I sleep in my skivvies.\u0027 He was standing in his shorts now, and Matt saw that his entire body was horribly pale. His ribs stood out in circular ridges.\\n\\n \u0027Turn your head, Mike. This way.\u0027\\n\\n Mike turned his head obediently.\\n\\n \u0027Mike, where did you get those marks?\u0027\\n\\n Mike\u0027s hand touched his throat below the angle of the jaw. \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n Matt stood restively. Then he went to the window. The catch was securely fastened, yet he rattled it back and forth with hands that were distraught. Beyond, the dark pressed against the glass heavily. \u0027Call me in the night if you want anything. Anything. Even if you have a bad dream. Will you do that, Mike?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I mean it. Anything. I\u0027m right down the hall.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I will.\u0027\\n\\n Hesitating, feeling there were other things he should do he went out.\\n\\n 5\\n\\n He didn\u0027t sleep at all, and the only thing now that kept him from calling Ben Mears was knowing that everyone at Eva\u0027s would be in bed. The boardinghouse was filled with old men, and when the phone rang late at night, it meant that someone had died.\\n\\n He lay restively, watching the luminous hands of his alarm clock move from eleven-thirty to twelve. The house was preternaturally silent - perhaps because his ears were consciously attuned to catch the slightest noise. The house was an old one and built solidly, and its settling groans had mostly ceased long before. There were no sounds but the clock and the faint passage of the wind outside. No cars passed on Taggart Stream Road late on week nights.\\n\\n What you\u0027re thinking is madness.\\n\\n But step by step he had been forced backward toward belief. Of course, being a literary man, it had been the first thing that had come to mind when Jimmy Cody had thumbnailed Danny Glick\u0027s case. He and Cody had laughed over it. Maybe this was his punishment for laugh?ing.\\n\\n Scratches? Those marks weren\u0027t scratches. They were punctures.\\n\\n One was taught that such things could not be; that things like Coleridge\u0027s \u0027Cristabel\u0027 or Brain Stoker\u0027s evil fairy tale were only the warp and woof of fantasy. Of course monsters existed; they were the men with their fingers on the thermonuclear triggers in six countries, the hijackers, the mass murderers, the child molesters. But not this. One knows better. The mark of the devil on a woman\u0027s breast is only a mole, the man who came back from the dead and stood at his wife\u0027s door dressed in the cerements of the grave was only suffering from locomotor ataxia, the bogey?man who gibbers and capers in the corner of a child\u0027s bedroom is only a heap of blankets. Some clergymen had proclaimed that even God, that venerable white warlock, was dead.\\n\\n He was bled almost white.\\n\\n No sound from up the hall. Matt thought: He is sleeping like the stones himself. Well, why not? Why had he invited Mike back to the house, if not for a good night\u0027s sleep, uninterrupted by . . . by bad dreams? He got out of bed and turned on the lamp and went to the window. From here one could just see the roof tree of the Marsten House, frosted in moonlight.\\n\\n I\u0027m frightened.\\n\\n But it was worse than that; he was dead scared. His mind ran over the old protections for an unmentionable disease: garlic, holy wafer and water, crucifix, rose, run?ning water. He had none of the holy things. He was a nonpracticing Methodist, and privately thought that John Groggins was the asshole of the Western world.\\n\\n The only religious object in the house was -\\n\\n Softly yet clearly in the silent house the words came, spoken in Mike Ryerson\u0027s voice, spoken in the dead ac?cents of sleep:\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Come in.\u0027\\n\\n Matt\u0027s breath stopped, then whistled out in soundless scream. He felt faint with fear. His belly seemed to have turned to lead. His testicles had drawn up. What in God\u0027s name had been invited into his house?\\n\\n Stealthily, the sound of the hasp on the guest room window being turned back. Then the grind of wood against wood as the window was forced up.\\n\\n He could go downstairs. Run, get the Bible from the dresser in the dining room. Run back up, jerk open the door to the guest room, hold the Bible high: In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, I command you to be gone -\\n\\n But who was in there?\\n\\n Call me in the night if you want anything.\\n\\n But I can\u0027t, Mike. I\u0027m an old man. I\u0027m afraid.\\n\\n Night invaded his brain and made it a circus of terrifying images which danced in and out of the shadows. Clown?-white faces, huge eyes, sharp teeth, forms that slipped from the shadows with long white hands that reached for . . . for . . .\\n\\n A shuddering groan escaped him, and he put his hands over his face.\\n\\n I can\u0027t. I am afraid.\\n\\n He could not have risen even if the brass knob on his own door had begun to turn. He was paralyzed with fear and wished crazily that he had never gone out to Dell\u0027s that night.\\n\\n I am afraid.\\n\\n And in the awful heavy silence of the house, as he sat impotently on his bed with his face in his hands, he heard the high, sweet, evil laugh of a child\\n\\n - and then the sucking sounds. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/salem-s-lot/page-9.html","bookId":2573,"book":{"id":2573,"title":"\u0027Salem\u0027s Lot","description":"Storyline: Something strange is going on in Jerusalem\u0027s Lot ... but no one dares to talk about it.
