{"id":93269,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"1 On September 25 Ben took dinner with the Nortons again. It was Thursday night, and the meal was traditional - beans and franks. Bill Norton grilled the franks on the outdoor grill, and Ann had had her kidney beans simmering in molasses since nine that morning. They ate at the picnic table and afterward they sat smoking, the four of them, talking desultorily of Boston\u0027s fading pennant chances. There was a subtle change in the air; it was still pleasant enough, even in shirt sleeves, but there was a glint of ice in it now. Autumn was waiting in the wings, almost in sight. The large and ancient maple in front of Eva Miller\u0027s boardinghouse had already begun to go red. There had been no change in Ben\u0027s relationship with the Nortons. Susan\u0027s liking for him was frank and clear and natural. And he liked her very much. In Bill he sensed a steadily increasing liking, held in abeyance by the subconscious taboo that affects all fathers when in the presence of men who are there because of their daughters rather than themselves. If you like another man and you are honest, you speak freely, discuss women over beer, shoot the shit about politics. But no matter how deep the potential liking, it is impossible to open up completely to a man who is dangling your daughter\u0027s potential decoration between his legs. Ben reflected that after marriage the possible had become the actual and could you become complete friends with the man who was banging your daughter night after night? There might be a moral there, but Ben doubted it. Ann Norton continued cool. Susan had told him a little of the Floyd Tibbits situation the night before - of her mother\u0027s assumption that her son-in-law problems had been solved neatly and satisfactorily in that direction. Floyd was a known quantity; he was Steady. Ben Mears, on the other hand, had come out of nowhere and might disappear back there just as quickly, possibly with her daughter\u0027s heart in his pocket. She distrusted the creative male with an instinctive small-town dislike (one that Edward Arlington Robinson or Sherwood Anderson would have recognized at once), and Ben suspected that down deep she had absorbed a maxim: either faggots or bull studs; sometimes homicidal, suicidal, or maniacal; tend to send young girls packages containing their left ears. Ben\u0027s participation in the search for Ralphie Glick seemed to have increased her suspicions rather than allayed them, and he suspected that winning her over was an impossi?bility. He wondered if she knew of Parkins Gillespie\u0027s visit to his room. He was chewing these thoughts over lazily when Ann said, \u0027Terrible about the Glick boy.\u0027 \u0027Ralphie? Yes,\u0027 Bill said. \u0027No, the older one. He\u0027s dead.\u0027 Ben started. \u0027Who? Danny?\u0027 \u0027He died early yesterday morning.\u0027 She seemed surprised that the men did not know. It had been all the talk. \u0027I heard them talking in Milt\u0027s,\u0027 Susan said. Her hand found Ben\u0027s under the table and he took it willingly. \u0027How are the Glicks taking it?\u0027 \u0027The same way I would,\u0027 Ann said simply. \u0027They are out of their minds.\u0027 Well they might be, Ben thought. Ten days ago their life had been going about its usual ordained cycle; now their family unit was smashed and in pieces. It gave him a morbid chill. \u0027Do you think the other Glick boy will ever show up alive?\u0027 Bill asked Ben. \u0027No,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027I think he\u0027s dead, too.\u0027 \u0027Like that thing in Houston two years ago,\u0027 Susan said. \u0027If he\u0027s dead, I almost hope they don\u0027t find him. Whoever could do something like that to a little, defenseless boy - \u0027 \u0027The police are looking around, I guess,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027Rounding up known sex offenders and talking to them.\u0027 \u0027When they find the guy they ought to hang him up by the thumbs,\u0027 Bill Norton said. \u0027Badminton, Ben?\u0027 Ben stood. \u0027No thanks. Too much like you playing solitaire with me for the dummy. Thanks for the nice meal. I\u0027ve got work to do tonight.\u0027 Ann Norton lifted her eyebrow and said nothing. Bill stood. \u0027How\u0027s that new book coming?\u0027 \u0027Good,\u0027 Ben said briefly. \u0027Would you like to walk down the hill with me and have a soda at Spencer\u0027s, Susan?\u0027 \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Ann interposed swiftly. \u0027After Ralphie Glick and all, I\u0027d feel better if - \u0027 \u0027Momma, I\u0027m a big girl,\u0027 Susan interposed. \u0027And there are streetlights all the way up Brock Hill.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll walk you back up, of course,\u0027 Ben said, almost formally. He had left his car at Eva\u0027s. The early evening had been too fine to drive. \u0027They\u0027ll be fine,\u0027 Bill said. \u0027You worry too much, Mother.\u0027 \u0027Oh, I suppose I do. Young folks always know best, don\u0027t they?\u0027 She smiled thinly. \u0027I\u0027ll just get a jacket,\u0027 Susan murmured to Ben, and turned up the back walk. She was wearing a red play skirt, thigh-high, and she exposed a lot of leg going up the steps to the door. Ben watched, knowing Ann was watching him watch. Her husband was damping the charcoal fire. \u0027How long do you intend to stay in the Lot, Ben?\u0027 Ann asked, showing polite interest. \u0027Until the book gets written, anyway,\u0027 he said. \u0027After that, I can\u0027t say. It\u0027s very lovely in the mornings, and the air tastes good when you breathe it.\u0027 He smiled into her eyes. \u0027I may stay longer.\u0027 She smiled back. \u0027It gets cold in the winters, Ben. Awfully cold.\u0027 Then Susan was coming back down the steps with a light jacket thrown over her shoulders. \u0027Ready? I\u0027m going to have a chocolate. Look out, complexion.\u0027 \u0027Your complexion will survive,\u0027 he said, and turned to Mr and Mrs Norton. \u0027Thank you again.\u0027 \u0027Anytime,\u0027 Bill said. \u0027Come on over with a six-pack tomorrow night, if you want. We\u0027ll make fun of that goddamn Yastrzemski.\u0027 \u0027That would be fun,\u0027 Ben said, \u0027but what\u0027ll we do after the second inning?\u0027 His laughter, hearty and full, followed them around the corner of the house. 2 \u0027I don\u0027t really want to go to Spencer\u0027s,\u0027 she said as they went down the hill. \u0027Let\u0027s go to the park instead.\u0027 ?\u0027What about muggers, lady?\u0027 he asked, doing the Bronx for her. \u0027In the Lot, all muggers have to be in by seven. It\u0027s a town ordinance. And it is now exactly eight-oh-three.\u0027 Darkness had fallen over them as they walked down the hill, and their shadows waxed and waned in the streetlights. \u0027Agreeable muggers you have,\u0027 he said. \u0027No one goes to the park after dark?\u0027 \u0027Sometimes the town kids go there to make out if they can\u0027t afford the drive-in,\u0027 she said, and winked at him. \u0027So if you see anyone skulking around in the bushes, look the other way.\u0027 They entered from the west side, which faced the Municipal Building. The park was shadowy and a little dreamlike, the concrete walks curving away under the leafy trees, and the wading pool glimmering quietly in the refracted glow from the streetlights. If anyone was here, Ben didn\u0027t see him. They walked around the War Memorial with its long lists of names, the oldest from the Revolutionary War, the newest from Vietnam, carved under the War of 1812. There were six home town names from the most recent conflict, the new cuts in the brass gleaming like fresh wounds. He thought: This town has the wrong name. It ought to be Time. And as if the action was a natural outgrowth of the thought, he looked over his shoulder for the Marsten House, but the bulk of the Municipal Building blocked it out. She saw his glance and it made her frown. As they spread their jackets on the grass and sat down (they had spurned the park benches without discussion), she said, \u0027Mom said Parkins Gillespie was checking up on you. The new boy in school must have stolen the milk money, or something like that.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s quite a character,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027Mom had you practically tried and convicted.\u0027 It was said lightly, but the lightness faltered and let something serious through. \u0027Your mother doesn\u0027t care for me much, does she?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Susan said, holding his hand. \u0027It was a case of dislike at first sight. I\u0027m very sorry.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s okay,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m batting five hundred anyway.\u0027 \u0027Daddy?\u0027 She smiled. \u0027He just knows class when he sees it.\u0027 The smile faded. \u0027Ben, what\u0027s this new book about?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s hard to say.\u0027 He slipped his loafers off and dug his toes into the dewy grass. \u0027Subject-changer.\u0027 \u0027No, I don\u0027t mind telling you.\u0027 And he found, surpris?ingly, that this was true. He had always thought of a work in progress as a child, a weak child, that had to be protected and cradled. Too much handling would kill it. He had refused to tell Miranda a word about Conway\u0027s Daughter or Air Dance, although she had been wildly curious about both of them. But Susan was different. With Miranda there had always been a directed sort of probing, and her questions were more like interrogations. \u0027Just let me think how to put it together,\u0027 he said. \u0027Can you kiss me while you think?\u0027 she asked, lying back on the grass. He was forcibly aware of how short her skirt was; it had given a lot of ground. \u0027I think that might interfere with the thought processes,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027Let\u0027s see.\u0027 He leaned over and kissed her, placing one hand lightly on her waist. She met his mouth firmly, and her hands closed over his. A moment later he felt her tongue for the first time, and he met it with his own. She shifted to return his kiss more fully, and the soft rustle of her cotton skirt seemed loud, almost maddening. He slid his hand up and she arched her breast into it, soft and full. For the second time since he had known her he felt sixteen, a head-busting sixteen with everything in front of him six lanes wide and no hard traveling in sight. \u0027Ben?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Make love to me? Do you want to?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027I want that.\u0027 \u0027Here on the grass,\u0027 she said. \u0027Yes.\u0027 She was looking up at him, her eyes wide in the dark. She said, \u0027Make it be good.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll try.\u0027 \u0027Slow,\u0027 she said. \u0027Slow. Slow. Here . . . \u0027 They became shadows in the dark. \u0027There,\u0027 he said. \u0027Oh, Susan.\u0027 13 They were walking, first aimlessly through the park, and then with more purpose toward Brock Street. \u0027Are you sorry?\u0027 he asked. She looked up at him and smiled without artifice. \u0027No. I\u0027m glad.\u0027 \u0027Good.\u0027 They walked hand in hand without speaking. \u0027The book?\u0027 she asked. \u0027You were going to tell me about that before we were so sweetly interrupted.\u0027 \u0027The book is about the Marsten House,\u0027 he said slowly. \u0027Maybe it didn\u0027t start out to be, not wholly. I thought it was going to be about this town. But maybe I\u0027m fooling myself. I researched Hubie Marsten, you know. He was a mobster. The trucking company was just a front.\u0027 She was looking at him in wonder. \u0027How did you find that out?\u0027 \u0027Some from the Boston police, and more from a woman named Minella Corey, Birdie Marsten\u0027s sister. She\u0027s seventy-nine now, and she can\u0027t remember what she had for breakfast, but she\u0027s never forgotten a thing that hap?pened before 1940.\u0027 \u0027And she told you - \u0027 \u0027As much as she knew. She\u0027s in a nursing home in New Hampshire, and I don\u0027t think anyone\u0027s really taken the time to listen to her in years. I asked her if Hubert Marsten had really been a contract killer in the Boston area - the police sure thought he was - and she nodded. \"How many?\" I asked her. She held her fingers up in front of her eyes and waggled them back and forth and said, \"How many times can you count these?\"\u0027 \u0027My God.\u0027 \u0027The Boston organization began to get very nervous about Hubert Marsten in 1927,\u0027 Ben went on. \u0027He was picked up for questioning twice, once by the city police and once by the Maiden police. The Boston grab was for a gangland killing, and he was back on the street in two hours. The thing in Malden wasn\u0027t business at all. It was the murder of an eleven-year-old boy. The child had been eviscerated.\u0027 \u0027Ben,\u0027 she said, and her voice was sick. \u0027Marsten\u0027s employers got him off the hook - I imagine he knew where a few bodies were buried - but that was the end of him in Boston. He moved quietly to \u0027salem\u0027s Lot, just a retired trucking official who got a check once a month. He didn\u0027t go out much. At least, not much that we know of.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve spent a lot of time in the library looking at old copies of the Ledger from 1928 to 1939. Four children disappeared in that period. Not that unusual, not in a rural area. Kids get lost, and they sometimes die of exposure. Sometimes kids get buried in a gravelpit slide. Not nice, but it happens.\u0027 \u0027But you don\u0027t think that\u0027s what happened?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. But I do know that not one of those four were ever found. No hunter turning up a skeleton in 1945 or a contractor digging one up while getting a load of gravel to make cement. Hubert and Birdie lived in that house for eleven years and the kids disappeared, and that\u0027s all anyone knows. But I keep thinking about that kid in Maiden. I think about that a lot. Do you know The Haunting of Hill House, by Shirley Jackson?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 He quoted softly, \"\u0027And whatever walked there, walked alone.\" You asked what my book was about. Essentially, it\u0027s about the recurrent power of evil.\u0027 She put her hands on his arm. \u0027You don\u0027t think that Ralphie Glick . . . \u0027 \u0027Was gobbled up by the revengeful spirit of Hubert Marsten, who comes back to life on every third year at the full of the moon?\u0027 \u0027Something like that.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re asking the wrong person if you want to be reassured. Don\u0027t forget, I\u0027m the kid who opened the door to an upstairs bedroom and saw him hanging from a beam.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s not an answer.\u0027 \u0027No, it\u0027s not. Let me tell you one other thing before I tell you exactly what I think. Something Minella Corey said. She said there are evil men in the world, truly evil men. Sometimes we hear of them, but more often they work in absolute darkness. She said she had been cursed with a knowledge of two such men in her lifetime. One was Adolf Hitler. The other was her brother-in-law, Hubert Marsten.\u0027 He paused. \u0027She said that on the day Hubie shot her sister she was three hundred miles away in Cape Cod. She had taken a job as housekeeper for a rich family that summer. She was making a tossed salad in a large wooden bowl. It was quarter after two in the afternoon. A bolt of pain, \"like lightning,\" she said, went through her head and she heard a shotgun blast. She fell on the floor, she claims. When she picked herself up - she was alone in the house - twenty minutes had passed. She looked in the wooden bowl and screamed. It appeared to her that it was full of blood.\u0027 \u0027God,\u0027 Susan murmured. \u0027A moment later, everything was normal again. No headache, nothing in the salad bowl but salad. But she said she knew - she knew - that her sister was dead, murdered with a shotgun.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s her unsubstantiated story?\u0027 \u0027Unsubstantiated, yes. But she\u0027s not some oily trickster; she\u0027s an old woman without enough brains left to lie. That part doesn\u0027t bother me, anyway. Not very much, at least. There\u0027s a large enough body of ESP data now so that a rational man laughs it off at his own expense. The idea that Birdie transmitted the facts of her death three hundred miles over a kind of psychic telegraph isn\u0027t half so hard for me to believe as the face of evil - the really monstrous face - that I sometimes think I can see buried in the outlines of that house. \u0027You asked me what I think. I\u0027ll tell you. I think it\u0027s relatively easy for people to accept something like telepa?thy or precognition or teleplasm because their willingness to believe doesn\u0027t cost them anything. It doesn\u0027t keep them awake nights. But the idea that the evil that men do lives after them is more unsettling.\u0027 He looked up at the Marsten House and spoke slowly. \u0027I think that house might be Hubert Marsten\u0027s monu?ment to evil, a kind of psychic sounding board. A super?natural beacon, if you like. Sitting there all these years, maybe holding the essence of Hubie\u0027s evil in its old, mold?ering bones. \u0027And now it\u0027s occupied again. \u0027And there\u0027s been another disappearance.\u0027 He turned to her and cradled her upturned face in his hands. \u0027You see, that\u0027s something I never counted on when I came back here. I thought the house might have been torn down, but never in my wildest dreams that it had been bought. I saw myself renting it and oh, I don\u0027t know. Confronting my own terrors and evils, maybe. Playing ghostbreaker, maybe - be gone in the name of all the saints, Hubie. Or maybe just tapping into the atmosphere of the place to write a book scary enough to make me a million dollars. But no matter what, I felt that I was in control of the situation, and that would make all the difference. I wasn\u0027t any nine-year-old kid anymore, ready to run screaming from a magic-lantern show that maybe came out of my own mind and no place else. But now . . . \u0027 \u0027Now what, Ben?\u0027 \u0027Now it\u0027s occupied!\u0027 he burst out, and beat a fist into his palm. \u0027I\u0027m not in control of the situation. A little boy has disappeared and I don\u0027t know what to make of it. It could have nothing to do with that house, but . . . I don\u0027t believe it.\u0027 The last four words came out in measured lengths. \u0027Ghosts? Spirits?\u0027 \u0027Not necessarily. Maybe just some harmless guy who admired the house when he was a kid and bought it and became . . . possessed.\u0027 \u0027Do you know something about - \u0027 she began, alarmed. \u0027The new tenant? No. I\u0027m just guessing. But if it is the house, I\u0027d almost rather it was possession than something else.\u0027 What?\u0027 He said simply, \u0027Perhaps it\u0027s called another evil man.\u0027 4 Ann Norton watched them from the window. She had called the drugstore earlier. No, Miss Coogan said, with something like glee. Not here. Haven\u0027t been in. Where have you been, Susan? Oh, where have you been? Her mouth twisted down into a helpless ugly grimace. Go away, Ben Mears. Go away and leave her alone. When she left his arms, she said, \u0027Do something important for me, Ben.\u0027 \u0027Whatever I can.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t mention those things to anyone else in town. Anyone.\u0027 He smiled humorlessly. \u0027Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not anxious to have people thinking I\u0027ve been struck nuts.\u0027 \u0027Do you lock your room at Eva\u0027s?\u0027 \u0027No. \u0027I\u0027d start locking it.\u0027 She looked at him levelly. \u0027You have to think of yourself as under suspicion.\u0027 \u0027With you, too?\u0027 \u0027You would be, if I didn\u0027t love you.\u0027 And then she was gone, hastening up the driveway, leaving him to look after her, stunned by all he had said and more stunned by the four or five words she had said at the end. 6 He found when he got back to Eva\u0027s that he could neither write nor sleep. He was too excited to do either. So he warmed up the Citro?n, and after a moment of indecision, he drove out toward Dell\u0027s place. It was crowded, and the place was smoky and loud. The band, a country-and-western group on trial called the Rangers, was playing a version of \u0027You\u0027ve Never Been This Far Before,\u0027 which made up in volume for whatever it lost in quality. Perhaps forty couples were gyrating on the floor, most of them wearing blue jeans. Ben, a little amused, thought of Edward Albee\u0027s line about monkey nipples. The stools in front of the bar were held down by con?struction and mill workers, each drinking identical glasses of beer and all wearing nearly identical crepe-soled work boots, laced with rawhide. Two or three barmaids with bouffant hairdos and their names written in gold thread on their white blouses (Jackie, Toni, Shirley) circulated to the tables and booths. Behind the bar, Dell was drawing beers, and at the far end, a hawk-like man with his hair greased back was making mixed drinks. His face remained utterly blank as he measured liquor into shot glasses, dumped it into his silver shaker, and added whatever went with it. Ben started toward the bar, skirting the dance floor, and someone called out, \u0027Ben! Say, fella! How are you, buddy?\u0027 Ben looked around and saw Weasel Craig sitting at a table close to the bar, a half-empty beer in front of him. \u0027Hello, Weasel,\u0027 Ben said, sitting down. He was relieved to see a familiar face, and he liked Weasel. \u0027Decided to get some night life, did you, buddy?\u0027 Weasel smiled and clapped him on the shoulder. Ben thought that his check must have come in; his breath alone could have made Milwaukee famous. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Ben said. He got out a dollar and laid it on the table, which was covered with the circular ghosts of the many beer glasses that had stood there. \u0027How you doing?\u0027 \u0027Just fine. What do you think of that new band? Great, ain\u0027t they?\u0027 They\u0027re okay,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027Finish that thing up before it goes flat. I\u0027m buying.\u0027 \u0027I been waitin\u0027 to hear somebody say that all night. Jackie!\u0027 he bawled. \u0027Bring my buddy here a pitcher! Budweiser!\u0027 Jackie brought the pitcher on a tray littered with beer?-soaked change and lifted it onto the table, her right arm bulging like a prize fighter\u0027s. She looked at the dollar as if it were a new species of cockroach. \u0027That\u0027s a buck fawty,\u0027 she said. Ben put another bill down. She picked them both up, fished sixty cents out of the assorted puddles on her tray, banged them down on the table, and said, \u0027Weasel Craig, when you yell like that you sound like a rooster gettin\u0027 its neck wrung.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re beautiful, darlin\u0027,\u0027 Weasel said. \u0027This is Ben Mears. He writes books.\u0027 \u0027Meetcha,\u0027 Jackie said, and disappeared into the dim?ness. Ben poured himself a glass of beer and Weasel followed suit, filling his glass professionally to the top. The foam threatened to overspill and then backed down. \u0027Here\u0027s to you, buddy.\u0027 Ben lifted his glass and drank. \u0027So how\u0027s that writin\u0027 goin\u0027?\u0027 \u0027Pretty good, Weasel.\u0027 \u0027I seen you goin\u0027 round with that little Norton girl. She\u0027s a real peach, she is. You couldn\u0027t do no better there.\u0027 \u0027Yes, she\u0027s - \u0027 \u0027Matt!\u0027 Weasel bawled, almost startling Ben into drop?ping his glass. By God, he thought, he does sound like a rooster saying good-by to this world. \u0027Matt Burke!\u0027 Weasel waved wildly, and a man with white hair raised his hand in greeting and started to cut through the crowd. \u0027Here\u0027s a fella you ought to meet,\u0027 Weasel told Ben. \u0027Matt Burke\u0027s one smart son of a whore.\u0027 The man coming toward them looked about sixty. He was tall, wearing a clean flannel shirt open at the throat, and his hair, which was as white as Weasel\u0027s, was cut in a flattop. \u0027Hello, Weasel,\u0027 he said. \u0027How are you, buddy?\u0027 Weasel said. \u0027Want you to meet a fella stayin\u0027 over to Eva\u0027s. Ben Mears. Writes books, he does. He\u0027s a lovely fella.\u0027 He looked at Ben. \u0027Me\u0027n Matt grew up together, only he got an education and I got the shaft.\u0027 Weasel cackled. Ben stood up and shook Matt Burke\u0027s bunched hand gingerly. \u0027How are you?\u0027 \u0027Fine, thanks. I\u0027ve read one of your books, Mr Mears. Air Dance.\u0027 \u0027Make it Ben, please. I hope you liked it.\u0027 \u0027I liked it much better than the critics, apparently,\u0027 Matt said, sitting down. \u0027I think it will gain ground as time goes by. How are you, Weasel?\u0027 \u0027Perky,\u0027 Weasel said. \u0027Just as perky as ever I could be. Jackie!\u0027 he bawled. \u0027Bring Matt a glass!\u0027 \u0027Just wait a minute, y\u0027old fart!\u0027 Jackie yelled back, draw?ing laughter from the nearby tables. \u0027She\u0027s a lovely girl,\u0027 Weasel said. \u0027Maureen Talbot\u0027s girl.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027I had Jackie in school. Class of \u002771. Her mother was \u00275 l.\u0027 \u0027Matt teaches high school English,\u0027 Weasel told Ben. \u0027You and him should have a lot to talk about.\u0027 \u0027I remember a girl named Maureen Talbot,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027She came and got my aunt\u0027s wash and brought it back all folded in a wicker basket. The basket only had one handle.\u0027 \u0027Are you from town, Ben?\u0027 Matt asked. \u0027I spent some time here as a boy. With my Aunt Cynthia.\u0027 \u0027Cindy Stowens?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 Jackie came with a clean glass, and Matt tipped beer into it. \u0027It really is a small world, then. Your aunt was in a senior class I taught my first year in \u0027salem\u0027s Lot. Is she well?\u0027 \u0027She died in 1972.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 \u0027She went very easily,\u0027 Ben said, and refilled his glass. The band had finished its set, and the members were trouping toward the bar. The level of conversation went down a notch. \u0027Have you come back to Jerusalem\u0027s Lot to write a book about us?\u0027 Matt asked. A warning bell went off in Ben\u0027s mind. \u0027In a way, I suppose,\u0027 he said. \u0027This town could do much worse for a biographer. Air Dance was a fine book. I think there might be another fine book in this town. I once thought I might write it.\u0027 \u0027Why didn\u0027t you?\u0027 Matt smiled - an easy smile with no trace of bitterness, cynicism, or malice. \u0027I lacked one vital ingredient. Talent.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t you believe it,\u0027 Weasel said, refilling his glass from the dregs of the pitcher. \u0027Ole Matt\u0027s got a world of talent. Schoolteachin\u0027 is a wonnerful job. Nobody appreci?ates schoolteachers, but they\u0027re . . . \u0027 He swayed a little in his chair, searching for completion. He was becoming very drunk. \u0027Salt of the earth,\u0027 he finished, took a mouthful of beer, grimaced, and stood up. \u0027Pardon me while I take a leak.\u0027 He wandered off, bumping into people and hailing them by name. They passed him on with impatience or good cheer, and watching his progress to the men\u0027s room was like watching a pinball racket and bounce its way down toward the flipper buttons. \u0027There goes the wreck of a fine man,\u0027 Matt said, and held up one finger. A waitress appeared almost immediately and addressed him as Mr Burke. She seemed a trifle scandalized that her old English Classics teacher should be here, boozing it up with the likes of Weasel Craig. When she turned away to bring them another pitcher, Ben thought Matt looked a trifle bemused. \u0027I like Weasel,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027I get a feeling there was a lot there once. What happened to him?\u0027 \u0027Oh, there\u0027s no story there,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027The bottle got him. It got him a little more each year and now it\u0027s got all of him. He won a Silver Star at Anzio in World War II. A cynic might believe his life would have had more meaning if he had died there.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not a cynic,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027I like him still. But I think I better give him a ride home tonight.\u0027 \u0027That would be good of you. I come out here now and then to listen to the music. I like loud music. More than ever, since my hearing began to fail. I understand that you\u0027re interested in the Marsten House. Is your book about it?\u0027 Ben jumped. \u0027Who told you that?\u0027 Matt smiled. \u0027How does that old Marvin Gaye song put it? I heard it through the grapevine. Luscious, vivid idiom, although the image is a bit obscure if you consider it. One conjures up a picture of a man standing with his ear cocked attentively toward a Concord or Tokay. . . . I\u0027m rambling. I ramble a great deal these days but rarely try to keep it in hand anymore. I heard from what the gentlemen of the press would call an informed source - Loretta Starcher, actually. She\u0027s the librarian at our local citadel of literature. You\u0027ve been in several times to look at the Cumberland Ledger articles pertaining to the ancient scandal, and she also got you two true-crime books that had articles on it. By the way, the Lubert one is good - he came to the Lot and researched it himself in 1946 - but the Snow chapter is speculative trash.\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 Ben said automatically. The waitress set down a fresh pitcher of beer and Ben suddenly had an uncomfortable image: Here is a fish swimming around comfortably and (he thinks) unobtrus?ively, flicking here and there amongst the kelp and the plankton. Draw away for the long view and there\u0027s the kicker: It\u0027s a goldfish bowl. Matt paid the waitress and said, \u0027Nasty thing that hap?pened up there. It\u0027s stayed in the town\u0027s consciousness, too. Of course, tales of nastiness and murder are always handed down with slavering delight from generation to generation, while students groan and complain when they\u0027re faced with a George Washington Carver or a Jonas Salk. But it\u0027s more than that, I think. Perhaps it\u0027s due to a geographical freak.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 Ben said, drawn in spite of himself. The teacher had just stated an idea that had been lurking below the level of his consciousness from the day he had arrived back in town, possibly even before that. \u0027It stands on that hill overlooking the village like - oh, like some kind of dark idol.\u0027 He chuckled to make the remark seem trivial - it seemed to him that he had said something so deeply felt in an unguarded way that he must have opened a window on his soul to this stranger. Matt Burke\u0027s sudden close scrutiny of him did not make him feel any better. \u0027That is talent,\u0027 he said. \u0027Pardon me?\u0027 \u0027You have said it precisely. The Marsten House has looked down on us all for almost fifty years, at all our little peccadilloes and sins and lies. Like an idol.\u0027 \u0027Maybe it\u0027s seen the good, too,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027There\u0027s little good in sedentary small towns. Mostly indifference spiced with an occasional vapid evil - or worse, a conscious one. I believe Thomas Wolfe wrote about seven pounds of literature about that.\u0027 \u0027I thought you weren\u0027t a cynic.\u0027 \u0027You said that, not I.\u0027 Matt smiled and sipped at his beer. The band was moving away from the bar, resplendent in their red shirts and glittering vests and neckerchiefs. The lead singer took his guitar and began to chord it. \u0027At any rate, you never answered my question. Is your new book about the Marsten House?\u0027 \u0027I suppose it is, in a way.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m pumping you. Sorry.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 Ben said, thinking of Susan and feeling uncomfortable. \u0027I wonder what\u0027s keeping Weasel? He\u0027s been gone a hell of a long time.\u0027 \u0027Could I presume on short acquaintanceship and ask a rather large favor? If you refuse, I\u0027ll more than understand.\u0027 \u0027Sure, ask,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027I have a creative writing class,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027They are intelligent children, eleventh- and twelfth-graders, most of them, and I would like to present someone who makes his living with words to them. Someone who - how shall I say? - has taken the word and made it flesh.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d be more than happy to,\u0027 Ben said, feeling absurdly flattered. \u0027How long are your periods?\u0027 \u0027Fifty minutes.\u0027 \u0027Well, I don\u0027t suppose I can bore them too badly in that length of time.\u0027 \u0027Oh? I do it quite well, I think,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027Although I\u0027m sure you wouldn\u0027t bore them at all. This next week?\u0027 \u0027Sure. Name a day and a time.\u0027 \u0027Tuesday? Period four? That goes from eleven o\u0027clock until ten of twelve. No one will boo you, but I suspect you will hear a great many stomachs rumble.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll bring some cotton for my ears.\u0027 Matt laughed. \u0027I\u0027m very pleased. I will meet you at the office, if that\u0027s agreeable.\u0027 \u0027Fine. Do you - \u0027 \u0027Mr Burke?\u0027 It was Jackie, she of the heavy biceps. \u0027Weasel\u0027s passed out in the men\u0027s room. Do you suppose - \u0027 \u0027Oh? Goodness, yes. Ben, would you - \u0027 \u0027Sure.\u0027 They got up and crossed the room. The band had begun to play again, something about how the kids in Muskogee still respected the college dean. The bathroom smelled of sour urine and chlorine. Weasel was propped against the wall between two urinals, and a fellow in an army uniform was pissing approximately two inches from his right ear. His mouth was open and Ben thought how terribly old he looked, old and ravaged by cold, impersonal forces with no gentle touch in them. The reality of his own dissolution, advancing day by day, came home to him, not for the first time, but with shocking unexpectedness. The pity that welled up in his throat like clear, black waters was as much for himself as for Weasel. \u0027Here,\u0027 Matt said, \u0027can you get an arm under him when this gentleman finishes relieving himself\u0027?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 Ben said. He looked at the man in the army uniform, who was shaking off in leisurely fashion. \u0027Hurry it up, can you, buddy?\u0027 \u0027Why? He ain\u0027t in no rush.\u0027 Nevertheless, he zipped up and stepped away from the urinal so they could get in. Ben got an arm around Weasel\u0027s back, hooked a hand in his armpit, and lifted. For a moment his buttocks pressed against the tiled wall and he could feel the vibrations from the band. Weasel came up with the limp mail sack weight of utter unconsciousness. Matt slid his head under Weasel\u0027s other arm, hooked his own arm around Weasel\u0027s waist, and they carried him out the door. \u0027There goes Weasel,\u0027 someone said, and there was laughter. \u0027Dell ought to cut him off,\u0027 Matt said, sounding out of breath. \u0027He knows how this always turns out.\u0027 They went through the door into the foyer, and then out onto the wooden steps leading down to the parking lot. \u0027Easy\" Ben grunted. \u0027Don\u0027t drop him.\u0027 They went down the stairs, Weasel\u0027s limp feet cropping on the risers like blocks of wood. \u0027The Citro?n . . . over in the last row.\u0027 They carried him over. The coolness in the air was sharper now, and tomorrow the leaves would be blooded. Weasel had begun to grunt deep in his throat and his head jerked weakly on the stalk of his neck. \u0027Can you put him to bed when you get back to Eva\u0027s?\u0027 Matt asked. \u0027Yes, I think so.\u0027 \u0027Good. Look, you can just see the roof tree of the Marsten House over the trees.\u0027 Ben looked. Matt was right; the top angle just peeked above the dark horizon of pines, blotting out the stars at the rim of the visible world with the regular shape of human construction. Ben opened the passenger door and said, \u0027Here. Let me have him.\u0027 He took Weasel\u0027s full weight and slipped him neatly into the passenger seat and closed the door. Weasel\u0027s head lolled against the window, giving it a flattened, grotesque look. \u0027Tuesday at eleven?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll be there.\u0027 \u0027Thanks. And thanks for helping Weasel, too.\u0027 He held out his hand and Ben shook it. He got in, started the Citro?n, and headed back toward town. Once the roadhouse neon had disappeared behind the trees, the road was deserted and black, and Ben thought, These roads are haunted now. Weasel gave a snort and a groan beside him and Ben? jumped. The Citro?n swerved minutely on the road. Now, why did I think that? No answer. He opened the wing window so that it scooped cold air directly onto Weasel on the ride home, and by the time he drove into Eva Miller\u0027s dooryard, Weasel had attained a soupy semi-consciousness. Ben led him, half stumbling, up the back porch steps and into the kitchen, which was dimly lit by the stove\u0027s fluorescent. Weasel moaned, then muttered deep in his throat, \u0027She\u0027s a lovely girl, Jack, -and married women, they know . . . know . . . \u0027 A shadow detached itself from the hall and it was Eva, huge in an old quilted house coat, her hair done up in rollers and covered with a filmy net scarf. Her face was pale and ghostly with night cream. \u0027Ed,\u0027 she said. \u0027Oh, Ed . . . you do go on, don\u0027t you?\u0027 His eyes opened a little at the sound of her voice, and a smile touched his features. \u0027On and on and on,\u0027 he croaked. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t you know it more than the rest?\u0027 \u0027Can you get him up to his room?\u0027 she asked Ben. \u0027Yes, no sweat.\u0027 He tightened his grip on Weasel and somehow jot him up the stairs and down to his room. The door was unlocked and he carried him inside. The minute he laid him on the bed, signs of consciousness ceased and he fell into a deep sleep. Ben paused a moment to look around. The room was clean, almost sterile, things put away with barrackslike neatness. As he began to work on Weasel\u0027s shoes, Eva Miller said from behind him, \u0027Never mind that, Mr Mears. Go on up, if you like.\u0027 \u0027But he ought to be - \u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll undress him.\u0027 Her face was grave and full of digni?fied, measured sadness. \u0027Undress him and give him an alcohol rub to help with his hangover in the morning. I\u0027ve done it before. Many times.\u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 Ben said, and went upstairs without looking back. He undressed slowly, thought about taking a shower, and decided not to. He got into bed and lay looking at the ceiling and did not sleep for a long time.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/salem-s-lot/page-7.html","bookId":2573,"book":{"id":2573,"title":"\u0027Salem\u0027s Lot","description":"Storyline: Something strange is going on in Jerusalem\u0027s Lot ... but no one dares to talk about it.
