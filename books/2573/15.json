{"id":93277,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"1\n On that same Sunday evening, Father Callahan stepped hesitantly into Matt Burke\u0027s hospital room at quarter to seven by Matt\u0027s watch. The bedside table and the counter?pane itself were littered with books, some of them dusty with age. Matt had called Loretta Starcher at her spinster\u0027s apartment and had not only gotten her to open the library on Sunday, but had gotten her to deliver the books in person. She had come in at the head of a procession made up of three hospital orderlies, each loaded down. She had left in something of a huff because he refused to answer questions about the strange conglomeration.\n Father Callahan regarded the schoolteacher curiously. He looked worn, but not so worn or wearily shocked as most of the parishioners he visited in similar circumstances. Callahan found that the common first reaction to news of cancer, strokes, heart attacks, or the failure of some major organ was one of betrayal. The patient was astounded to find that such a close (and, up to now at least, fully understood) friend as one\u0027s own body could be so sluggard as to lie down on the job. The reaction which followed close on the heels of the first was the thought that a friend who would let one down so cruelly was not worth having. The conclusion that followed these reactions was that it didn\u0027t matter if this friend was worth having or not. One could not refuse to speak to one\u0027s traitorous body, or get up a petition against it, or pretend that one was not at home when it called. The final thought in this hospital-bed train of reasoning was the hideous possibility that one\u0027s body might not be a friend at all, but an enemy implacably dedicated to destroying the superior force that had used it and abused it ever since the disease of reason set in.\n Once, while in a fine drunken frenzy, Callahan had sat down to write a monograph on the subject for The Catholic Journal. He had even illustrated it with a fiendish editorial? page cartoon, which showed a brain poised on the highest ledge of a skyscraper. The building (labeled \u0027The Human Body\u0027) was in flames (which were labeled \u0027Cancer\u0027 - ?although they might have been a dozen others). The car?toon was titled \u0027Too Far to Jump\u0027. During the next day\u0027s enforced bout with sobriety, he had torn the prospective monograph to shreds and burned the cartoon - there was no place in Catholic doctrine for either, unless you wanted to add a helicopter labeled \u0027Christ\u0027 that was dangling a rope ladder. Nonetheless, he felt that his insights had been true ones, and the result of such sickbed logic on the part of the patient was usually acute depression. The symptoms included dulled eyes, slow responses, sighs fetched from deep within the chest cavity, and sometimes tears at the sight of the priest, that black crow whose function was ultimately predicated on the problem the fact of mortality presented to the thinking being.\n Matt Burke showed none of this depression. He held out his hand, and when Callahan shook it, he found the grip surprisingly strong.\n \u0027Father Callahan. Good of you to come.\u0027\n \u0027Pleased to. Good teachers, like a wife\u0027s wisdom, are pearls beyond price.\u0027\n \u0027Even agnostic old bears like myself?\u0027\n \u0027Especially those,\u0027 Callahan said, riposting with pleasure. \u0027I may have caught you at a weak moment. There are no atheists in the foxholes, I\u0027ve been told, and precious few agnostics in the Intensive Care ward.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m being moved soon, alas.\u0027\n \u0027Pish-posh,\u0027 Callahan said. \u0027We\u0027ll have you Hail Marying and Our Fathering yet.\u0027\n \u0027That,\u0027 Matt said, \u0027is not as far-fetched as you might think.\u0027\n Father Callahan sat down, and his knee bumped the bedstand as he drew his chair up. A carelessly piled stack of books cascaded into his lap. He read the titles aloud as he put them back.\n \u0027Dracula. Dracula\u0027s Guest. The Search for Dracula. The Golden Bough. The Natural History of the Vampire - ?natural? Hungarian Folk Tales. Monsters of the Darkness. Monsters in Real Life. Peter Kurtin, Monster of D��sseldorf. And . . .\u0027 He brushed a thick patina of dust from the last cover and revealed a spectral figure poised menacingly above a sleeping damsel. \u0027Varney the Vampyre, or, The Feast of Blood. Goodness - required reading for convalesc?ent heart attack patients?\u0027\n Matt smiled. \u0027Poor old Varney. I read it a long time ago for a class report in Eh-279 at the university . . . Romantic Lit. The professor, whose idea of fantasy began with Beowulf and ended with The Screwtape Letters, was quite shocked. I got a D plus on the report and a written command to elevate my sights.\u0027\n \u0027The case of Peter Kurtin is interesting enough, though,\u0027 Callahan said. \u0027In a repulsive sort of way.\u0027\n \u0027You know his history?\u0027\n \u0027Most of it, yes. I took an interest in such things as a divinity student. My excuse to the highly skeptical elders was that, in order to be a successful priest, one had to plumb the depths of human nature as well as aspire to its heights. All eyewash, actually. I just liked a shudder as well as the next one. Kurtin, I believe, murdered two of his playmates as a young boy by drowning them - he simply gained possession of a small float anchored in the middle of a wide river and kept pushing them away until they tired and went under.\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027As a teenager, he twice tried to kill the parents of a girl who refused to go walking with him. He later burned down their house. But that is not the part of his, uh, career that I\u0027m interested in.\u0027\n \u0027I guessed not, from the trend of your reading matter.\u0027\n He picked a magazine off the coverlet which showed an incredibly endowed young woman in a skintight costume who was sucking the blood of a young man. The young man\u0027s expression seemed to be an uneasy combination of extreme terror and extreme lust. The name of the magazine - and of the young woman, apparently - was Vampirella. Callahan put it down, more intrigued than ever.\n \u0027Kurtin attacked and killed over a dozen women,\u0027 Callahan said. \u0027Mutilated many more with a hammer. If it was their time of the month, he drank their discharge.\u0027 Matt Burke nodded again. \u0027What\u0027s not so generally known,\u0027 he said, \u0027is that he also mutilated animals. At the height of his obsession, he ripped the heads from the bodies of two swans in D��sseldorf\u0027s central park and drank the blood which gushed from their necks.\u0027\n \u0027Has all this to do with why you wanted to see me?\u0027 Callahan asked. \u0027Mrs Curless told me you said it was a matter of some importance.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, it does and it is.\u0027\n \u0027What might it be, then? If you\u0027ve meant to intrigue me, you\u0027ve certainly succeeded.\u0027\n Matt looked at him calmly. \u0027A good friend of mine, Ben Mears, was to have gotten in touch with you today. Your housekeeper said he had not.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s so. I\u0027ve seen no one since two o\u0027clock this after?noon.\u0027\n \u0027I have been unable to reach him. He left the hospital in the company of my doctor, James Cody. I have also been unable to reach him. I have likewise been unable to reach Susan Norton, Ben\u0027s lady friend. She went out early this afternoon, promising her parents she would be in by five. They are worried.\u0027\n Callahan sat forward at this. He had a passing acquaint?ance with Bill Norton, who had once come to see him about a problem that had to do with some Catholic co-workers. \u0027You suspect something?\u0027\n \u0027Let me ask you a question,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027Take it very seriously and think it over before you answer. Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary in town just lately?\u0027\n Callahan\u0027s original impression, now almost a certainty, was that this man was proceeding very carefully indeed, not wanting to frighten him off by whatever was on his mind. Something sufficiently outrageous was suggested by the litter of books.\n \u0027Vampires in \u0027salem\u0027s Lot?\u0027 he asked.\n He was thinking that the deep depression which followed grave illness could sometimes be avoided if the person afflicted had a deep enough investment in life: artists, musicians, a carpenter whose thoughts centered on some half-completed building. The interest could just as well be linked to some harmless (or not so harmless) psychosis, perhaps incipient before the illness.\n He had spoken at some length with an elderly man named Horris from Schoolyard Hill who had been in the Maine Medical Center with advanced cancer of the lower intestine. In spite of pain which must have been excruciat?ing, be had discoursed with Callahan in great and lucid detail concerning the creatures from Uranus who were infiltrating every walk of American life. \u0027One day the fella who fills your gas tank down at Sonny\u0027s Amoco is just Joe Blow from Falmouth,\u0027 this bright-eyed, talking skeleton told him, \u0027and the next day it\u0027s a Uranian who just 0 like Joe Blow. He even has Joe Blow\u0027s memories and speech patterns, you see. Because Uranians eat alpha waves . . . smack, smack, smack!\u0027 According to Horris, he did not have cancer at all, but an advanced case of laser poisoning. The Uranians, alarmed at his knowledge of their machinations, had decided to put him out of the way. Horris accepted this, and was prepared to go down fighting. Callahan made no effort to disabuse him. Leave that to well-meaning but thickheaded relatives. Callahan\u0027s experi?ence was that psychosis, like a good knock of Cutty Sark, could be extremely beneficial.\n So now he simply folded his hands and waited for Matt to continue.\n Matt said, \u0027It\u0027s difficult to proceed as it is. It\u0027s going to be more difficult still if you think I\u0027m suffering from sickbed dementia.\u0027\n Startled by hearing his thoughts expressed just as he had finished thinking them, Callahan kept his poker face only with difficulty - although the emotion that would have come through would not have been disquiet but admir?ation.\n \u0027On the contrary, you seem extremely lucid,\u0027 he said.\n Matt sighed. \u0027Lucidity doesn\u0027t presuppose sanity - as you well know.\u0027 He shifted in bed, redistributing the books that lay around him. \u0027If there is a God, He must be making me do penance for a life of careful academicism - of refusing to plant an intellectual foot on any ground until it had been footnoted in triplicate. Now for the second time in one day, I\u0027m compelled to make the wildest declarations without a shred of proof to back them up. All I can say in defense of my own sanity is that my statements can be either proved or disproved without too much difficulty, and hope that you will take me seriously enough to make the test before it\u0027s too late.\u0027 He chuckled. \u0027Before it\u0027s too late. Sounds straight out of the thirties\u0027 pulp magazines, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027Life is full of melodrama,\u0027 Callahan remarked, reflect?ing that if it were so, he had seen precious little of it lately.\n \u0027Let me ask you again if you have noticed anything ?anything - out of the way or peculiar this weekend.\u0027\n \u0027To do with vampires, or - \u0027\n \u0027To do with anything.\u0027\n Callahan thought it over. \u0027The dump\u0027s closed,\u0027 he said finally. \u0027But the gate was broken off, so I drove in anyway.\u0027 He smiled. \u0027I rather enjoy taking my own garbage to the dump. It\u0027s so practical and humble that I can indulge my elitist fantasies of a poor but happy proletariat to the fullest. Dud Rogers wasn\u0027t around, either.\u0027\n \u0027Anything else?\u0027\n \u0027Well . . . the Crocketts weren\u0027t at mass this morning, and Mrs Crockett hardly ever misses.\u0027\n \u0027More?\u0027\n \u0027Poor Mrs Glick, of course - \u0027\n Matt got up on one elbow. \u0027Mrs Glick? What about her?\u0027 \n \u0027She \u0027s dead.\n \u0027Of what?\u0027\n \u0027Pauline Dickens seemed to think it was a heart attack,\u0027\n Callahan said, but hesitatingly.\n \u0027Has anyone else died in the Lot today?\u0027 Ordinarily, it would have been a foolish question. Deaths in a small town like \u0027salem\u0027s Lot were generally spread apart, in spite of the higher proportion of elderly in the population.\n \u0027No,\u0027 Callahan said slowly. \u0027But the mortality rate has certainly been high lately, hasn\u0027t\u0027 it? Mike Ryerson . . . Floyd Tibbits . . . the McDougall baby . . .\u0027\n Matt nodded, looking tired. \u0027Passing strange,\u0027 he said. \u0027Yes. But things are reaching the point where they\u0027ll be able to cover up for each other. A few more nights and I\u0027m afraid . . . afraid . . . \u0027\n \u0027Let\u0027s stop beating around the bush,\u0027 Callahan said.\n \u0027All right. There\u0027s been rather too much of that already, hasn\u0027t there?\u0027\n He began to tell his story from beginning to end, weaving in Ben\u0027s and Susan\u0027s and Jimmy\u0027s additions as he went along, holding back nothing. By the time he had finished, the evening\u0027s horror had ended for Ben and Jimmy. Susan Norton\u0027s was just beginning.\n 2\n When he had finished, Matt allowed a moment of silence and then said, \u0027So. Am I crazy?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re determined that people will think you so, any?way,\u0027 Callahan said, \u0027in spite of the fact that you seem to have convinced Mr Mears and your own doctor. No, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re crazy. After all, I am in the business of dealing with the supernatural. If I may be allowed a small pun, it is my bread and wine.\u0027\n \u0027But - \u0027\n \u0027Let me tell you a story. I won\u0027t vouch for its truth, but I will vouch for my own belief that it is true. It concerns a good friend of mine, Father Raymond Bissonette, who has been ministering to a parish in Cornwall for some Years now - along the so-called Tin Coast. Do you know of it?\u0027\n \u0027Through reading, yes.\u0027\n \u0027Some five years ago he wrote me that he had been called to an out-of-the-way corner of his parish to conduct a funeral service for a girl who had just \"pined away\". The girl\u0027s coffin was filled with wild roses, which struck Ray as unusual. What he found downright grotesque was the fact that her mouth had been propped open with a stick and then filled with garlic and wild thyme.\u0027\n \u0027But those are - \u0027\n \u0027Traditional protections against the rising of the Undead, yes. Folk remedies. When Ray inquired, he was told quite matter-of-factly by the girl\u0027s father that she had been killed by an incubus. You know the meaning?\u0027\n \u0027A sexual vampire.\u0027\n \u0027The girl had been betrothed to a young man named Bannock, who had a large strawberry-colored birthmark on the side of his neck. He was struck and killed by a car on his way home from work two weeks before the wedding. Two years later, the girl became engaged to another man. She broke it off quite suddenly during the week before the banns were to be cried for the second time. She told her parents and friends that John Bannock had been coming to her in the night and she had been unfaithful with him. Her present lover, according to Ray, was more distressed by the thought that she might have become mentally unbal?anced than by the possibility of demon visitation. Nonethe?less, she wasted away, died, and was buried in the old ways of the church.\n \u0027All of that did not occasion Ray\u0027s letter. What did was an occurrence some two months after the girl\u0027s burial. While he was on an early morning walk, Ray spied a young man standing by the girl\u0027s grave - a young man with a strawberry-colored birthmark on his neck. Nor is that the end of the story. He had gotten a Polaroid camera from his parents the Christmas before and had amused himself by snapping various views of the Cornish countryside. I have some of them in a picture album at the rectory - they\u0027re quite good. The camera was around his neck that morning, and he took several snaps of the young man. When he showed them around the village, the reaction was quite amazing. One old lady fell down in a faint, and the dead girl\u0027s mother began to pray in the street.\n \u0027But when Ray got up the next morning, the young man\u0027s figure had completely faded out of the pictures, and all that was left were several views of the local churchyard.\u0027\n \u0027And you believe that?\u0027 Matt asked.\n \u0027Oh yes. And I suspect most people would. The ordinary fellow isn\u0027t half so leery of the supernatural as the fiction writers like to make out. Most writers who deal in that particular subject, as a matter of fact, are more hardheaded about spirits and demons and boogies than your ordinary man in the street. Lovecraft was an atheist. Edgar Allen Poe was sort of a half-assed transcendentalist. And Hawthorne was only conventionally religious.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re amazingly conversant on the subject,\u0027 Matt said.\n The priest shrugged. \u0027I had a boy\u0027s interest in the occult and the outr��,\u0027 he said, \u0027and as I grew older, my calling to the priesthood enhanced rather than retarded it.\u0027 He sighed deeply. \u0027But lately I\u0027ve begun to ask myself some rather hard questions about the nature of evil in the world.\u0027 With a twisted smile he added, \u0027It\u0027s spoiled a lot of the fun.\u0027\n \u0027Then . . . would you investigate a few things for me? And would you be averse to taking along some holy water and a bit of the Host?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re treading on uneasy theological ground now, Callahan said with genuine gravity.\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not going to say no, not at this point,\u0027 Callahan said. \u0027And I ought to tell you that if you\u0027d gotten a younger priest, he probably would have said yes almost at once, with few if any qualms at all.\u0027 He smiled bitterly. \u0027They view the trappings of the church as symbolic rather than practical - like a shaman\u0027s headdress and medicine stick. This young priest might decide you were crazy, but if shaking a little holy water around would case your craziness, fine and dandy. I can\u0027t do that. If I should proceed to make your investigations in a neat Harris tweed with nothing under my arm but a copy of Sybil Leek\u0027s The Sensuous Exorcist or whatever, that would be between you and me. But if I go with the Host . . . then I go as an agent of the Holy Catholic Church, prepared to execute what I would consider the most spiritual rites of my office. Then I go as Christ\u0027s representative on earth.\u0027 He was now looking at Matt seriously, solemnly. \u0027I may be a poor excuse for a priest - at times I\u0027ve thought so - a bit jaded, a bit cynical, and just lately suffering a crisis of . . . what? faith? identity? . . . but I still believe enough in the awe?some, mystical, and apotheotic power of the church which. stands behind me to tremble a bit at the thought of accept?ing your request lightly. The church is more than a bundle of ideals, as these younger fellows seem to believe. It\u0027s more than a spiritual Boy Scout troop. The church is a Force . . . and one does not set a Force in motion lightly.\u0027 He frowned severely at Matt. \u0027Do you understand that? Your understanding is vitally important.\u0027\n \u0027I understand.\u0027\n \u0027You see, the over-all concept of evil in the Catholic Church has undergone a radical change in this century. Do you know what caused it?\u0027\n \u0027I imagine it was Freud.\u0027\n \u0027Very good. The Catholic Church began to cope with a new concept as it marched into the twentieth century: evil with a small \"e\". With a devil that was not a red-horned monster complete with spiked tall and cloven hooves, or a serpent crawling through the garden - although that is a remarkably apt psychological image. The devil, according to the Gospel According to Freud, would be a gigantic composite id, the subconscious of all of us.\u0027\n \u0027Surely a more stupendous concept than red-tailed boog?ies or demons with such sensitive noses that they can be banished with one good fart from a constipated church?man,\u0027 Matt said.\n \u0027Stupendous, of course. But impersonal. Merciless. Un?touchable. Banishing Freud\u0027s devil is as impossible as Shylock\u0027s bargain to extract a pound of flesh without spilling a drop of blood. The Catholic Church has been forced to reinterpret its whole approach to evil - bombers over Cambodia, the war in Ireland and the Middle East, cop-killings and ghetto riots, the billion smaller evils loosed on the world each day like a plague of gnats. It is in the process of shedding its old medicine-man skin and re-emerging as a socially active, socially conscious body. The inner city rap-center ascendant over the confessional. Communion playing second fiddle to the civil rights move?ment and urban renewal. The church has been in the process of planting both feet in this world.\u0027\n \u0027Where there are no witches or incubi or vampires,\u0027 Matt said, \u0027but only child-beating, incest, and the rape of the environment.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n Matt said deliberately, \u0027And you hate it, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Callahan said quietly. \u0027I think it\u0027s an abomination. It\u0027s the Catholic Church\u0027s way of saying that God isn\u0027t dead, only a little senile. And I guess that\u0027s my answer, isn\u0027t it? What do you want me to do?\u0027\n Matt told him.\n Callahan thought it over and said, \u0027You realize it flies in the face of everything I just told you?\u0027\n \u0027On the contrary, I think it\u0027s your chance to put your church - your church - to the test.\u0027\n Callahan took a deep breath. \u0027Very well, I agree. On one condition.\u0027\n \u0027What would that be?\n \u0027That all of us who go on this little expedition first go to the shop this Mr Straker is managing. That Mr Mears, as spokesman, should speak to him frankly about all of this. That we all have a chance to observe his reactions. And finally, that he should have, his chance to laugh in our faces.\u0027\n Matt was frowning. \u0027It would be warning him.\u0027\n Callahan shook his head. \u0027I believe the warning would be of no avail if the three of us - Mr Mears, Dr Cody, and myself - still agreed that we should move ahead regardless.\u0027 \n \u0027All right,\u0027 Matt said. \u0027I agree, contingent on the ap?proval of Ben and Jimmy Cody.\u0027\n \u0027Fine.\u0027 Callahan sighed. \u0027Will it hurt you if I tell you that I hope this is all in your mind? That I hope this man Straker does laugh in our faces, and with good reason?\u0027\n \u0027Not in the slightest.\u0027\n \u0027I do hope it. I have agreed to more than you know. It frightens me.\u0027\n \u0027I am frightened, too,\u0027 Matt said softly.\n 3\n But walking back to St Andrew\u0027s, he did not feel frightened at all. He felt exhilarated, renewed. For the first time in years he was sober and did not crave a drink.\n He went into the rectory, picked up the telephone, and dialed Eva Miller\u0027s boardinghouse. \u0027Hello? Mrs Miller? May I speak with Mr Mears? . . . He\u0027s not. Yes, I see . . . No, no message. I\u0027ll call tomorrow. Yes, good-by.\u0027 He hung up and went to the window.\n Was Mears out there someplace, drinking beer on a country road, or could it be that everything the old school?teacher had told him was true?\n If so . . . if so . . .\n He could not stay in the house. He went out on the back porch, breathing in the brisk, steely air of October, and looked into the moving darkness. Perhaps it wasn\u0027t all Freud after all. Perhaps a large part of it had to do with the invention of the electric light, which had killed the shadows in men\u0027s minds much more effectively than a stake through a vampire\u0027s heart - and less messily, too.\n The evil still went on, but now it went on in the hard, soulless glare of parking-lot fluorescents, of neon tubing, of hundred-watt bulbs by the billions. Generals planned strategic air strikes beneath the no-nonsense glow of alter?nating current, and it was all out of control, like a kid\u0027s soapbox racer going downhill with no brakes: I was follow?ing my orders. Yes, that was true, patently true. We were all soldiers, simply following what was written on our walking papers. But where were the orders coming from, ultimately? Take me to your leader. But where is his office? I was just following orders. The people elected me. But who elected the people?\n Something flapped overhead and Callahan looked up, startled out of his confused revery. A bird? A bat? Gone. Didn\u0027t matter.\n He listened for the town and heard nothing but the whine of telephone wires.\n The night the kudzu gets your fields, you sleep like the dead.\n Who wrote that? Dickey?\n No sound; no light but the fluorescent in front of the church where Fred Astaire had never danced and the faint waxing and waning of the yellow warning light at the crossroads of Brock Street and Jointner Avenue. No baby cried.\n The night the kudzu gets your fields, you sleep like -\n ?The exultation had faded away like a bad echo of pride. Terror struck him around the heart like a blow. Not terror for his life or his honor or that his housekeeper might find out about his drinking. It was a terror he had never dreamed of, not even in the tortured days of his ado?lescence.\n The terror he felt was for his immortal soul. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/salem-s-lot/page-15.html","bookId":2573,"book":{"id":2573,"title":"\u0027Salem\u0027s Lot","description":"Storyline: \n Something strange is going on in Jerusalem\u0027s Lot ... but no one dares to talk about it.
