{"id":93282,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"He leaned back, closed his eyes, and put his hands over them. There was something else, and in his mind he associated it with plastic. Why plastic? There were plastic toys and plastic utensils for picnics and plastic drop covers to put over your boat when winter came -\n And suddenly a picture of a pool table draped in a large plastic dust cover formed in his mind, complete with sound track, a voiceover that was saying, I really ought to sell it before the felt gets mildew or something - Ed Craig says it might mildew - but it was Ralph\u0027s . . .\n He opened his eyes. \u0027I know where he is,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know where Barlow is. He\u0027s in the basement of Eva Miller\u0027s boardinghouse.\u0027 And it was true; he knew it was. It felt incontrovertibly right in his mind. \n Mark\u0027s eyes flashed brilliantly. \u0027Let\u0027s go get him.\u0027\n \u0027Wait.\u0027\n He went to the phone, found Eva\u0027s number in the book, and dialed it swiftly. It rang with no answer. Ten rings, eleven, a dozen. He put it back in its cradle, frightened. There had been at least ten roomers at Eva\u0027s, many of them old men, retired. There was always someone around. Always before this.\n He looked at his watch. It was quarter after three and time was racing, racing.\n \u0027Let\u0027s go,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027What about Ben?\u0027\n Jimmy said grimly, \u0027We can\u0027t call. The line\u0027s out at your house. If we go straight to Eva\u0027s, there\u0027ll be plenty of daylight left if we\u0027re wrong. If we\u0027re right, we\u0027ll come back and get Ben and stop his fucking clock.\u0027\n \u0027Let me put my shirt on again,\u0027 Mark said, and ran down the hall to the bathroom.\n 41\n Ben\u0027s Citro?n was still sitting in Eva\u0027s parking lot, now plastered with wet leaves from the elms that shaded the square of gravel. The wind had picked up but the rain had stopped. The sign that said \u0027Eva\u0027s Rooms\u0027 swung and squeaked in the gray afternoon. The house had an eerie silence about it, a waiting quality, and Jimmy made a mental connection and was chilled by it. It was just like the Marsten House. He wondered if anyone had ever committed suicide here. Eva would know, but he didn\u0027t think Eva would be talking . . . not anymore.\n \u0027It would be perfect,\u0027 he said aloud. \u0027Take up residence in the local boardinghouse and then surround yourself with your children,\u0027\n \u0027Are you sure we shouldn\u0027t get Ben?\u0027\n \u0027Later. Come on.\u0027\n They got out of the car and walked toward the porch.\n The wind pulled at their clothes, riffled their hair. All the shades were drawn, and the house seemed to brood over them.\n \u0027Can you smell it?\u0027 Jimmy asked.\n \u0027Yes. Thicker than ever.\u0027\n \u0027Are you up to this?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Mark said firmly. \u0027Are you.\n \u0027I hope to Christ I am,\u0027 Jimmy said.\n They went up the porch steps and Jimmy tried the door. It was unlocked. When they stepped into Eva Miller\u0027s compulsively neat big kitchen, the odor smote them both, like an open garbage pit - yet dry, as with the smoke of years.\n Jimmy remembered his conversation with Eva - it had been almost four years ago, just after he had begun practic?ing. Eva had come in for a check-up. His father had had her for a patient for years, and when Jimmy took his place, even running things out of the same Cumberland office, she had come to him without embarrassment. They had spoken of Ralph, dead twelve years even then, and she had told him that Ralph\u0027s ghost was still in the house ?every now and then she would turn up something new and temporarily forgotten in the attic or a bureau drawer. And of course there was the pool table in the basement. She said that she really ought to get rid of it; it was just taking up space she could use for something else. But it had been Ralph\u0027s and she just couldn\u0027t bring herself to take out an ad in the paper or call up the local radio \u0027Yankee Trader\u0027 program.\n Now they walked across the kitchen to the cellar door and Jimmy opened it. The stench was thick, powering. He thumbed the light switch but got no response. He would have broken that, of course.\n \u0027Look around,\u0027 he told Mark. \u0027She\u0027s got to have a flashlight, or candles.\u0027\n Mark began nosing around, pulling open drawers and looking into them. He noticed that the knife rack over the sink was empty, but thought nothing of it at the time. His heart was thudding with painful slowness, like a muffled drum. He recognized the fact that he was now on the far, ragged edges of his endurance, at the outer limits. His mind did not seem to be thinking, but only reacting. He kept seeing movement at the corners of his eyes and jerking his head around to look, seeing nothing. A war veteran might have recognized the symptoms which signaled the onset of battle fatigue.\n He went out into the hall and looked through the dresser there. In the third drawer he found a long four?cell flashlight. He took it back to the kitchen. \u0027Here it is, J - \u0027\n There was a rattling noise, followed by a heavy thump. The cellar door stood open.\n And the screams began.\n 42\n When Mark stepped back into the kitchen of Eva\u0027s Rooms, it was twenty minutes of five. His eyes were hollow, and his T-shirt was smeared with blood. His eyes were stunned and slow.\n Suddenly he shrieked.\n The sound came roaring out of his belly, up the dark passage of his throat, and through his distended jaws. He shrieked until he felt some of the madness begin to leave his brain. He shrieked until his throat cracked and an awful pain lodged in his vocal cords like a sliver of bone. And even when he had externalized all the fear, the horror, the rage, the disappointment that he could, that awful pressure remained, coming up out of the cellar in waves - the knowledge of Barlow\u0027s presence somewhere down there - ?and now it was close to dark.\n He went outside onto the porch and breathed great gasps of the windy air. Ben. He had to get Ben. But an odd sort of lethargy seemed to have wrapped his legs in lead. What was the use? Barlow was going to win. They had been crazy to go against him. And now Jimmy had paid the full price, as well as Susan and the Father.\n The steel in him came up. No. No. No.\n He went down the porch steps on trembling legs and got into Jimmy\u0027s Buick. The keys hung in the ignition.\n Get Ben. Try once more.\n His legs were too short to reach the pedals. He pulled the seat up and twisted the key. The engine roared. He put the gearshift lever in drive and put his foot on the gas. The car leaped forward. He slammed his foot down on the power brake and was thrown painfully into the steering wheel. The horn honked.\n I can\u0027t drive it!\n And he seemed to hear his father saying in his logical, pedantic voice: You must be careful when you learn to drive, Mark. Driving is the only means of transportation that is not fully regulated by federal law. As a result, all the operators are amateurs. Many of these amateurs are suicidal. Therefore, you must be extremely careful. You use the gas pedal like there was an egg between it and your foot. When you\u0027re driving a car with an automatic transmission, like ours, the left foot is not used at all. Only the right is used; first brake and then gas.\n He let his foot off the brake and the car crawled forward down the driveway. It bumped over the curb and he brought it to a jerky stop. The windshield had fogged up. He rubbed it with his arm and only smeared it more.\n \u0027Screw it,\u0027 he muttered.\n He started up jerkily and performed a wide, drunken U-turn, driving over the far curb in the process, and set off for his house. He had to crane his neck to see over the steering wheel. He fumbled out with his right hand and turned on the radio and played it loud. He was crying.\n 43\n Ben was walking down Jointner Avenue toward town when Jimmy\u0027s tan Buick came up the road, moving in jerks and spasms, weaving drunkenly. He waved at it and it pulled over, bounced the left front wheel over the curb, and came to a stop.\n He had lost track of time making the stakes, and when he looked at his watch, he had been startled to see that it was nearly ten minutes past four. He had shut down the lathe, taken a couple of the stakes, put them in his belt, and gone upstairs to use the telephone. He had only put his hand on it when he remembered it was out.\n Badly worried now, he ran outside and looked in both cars, Callahan\u0027s and Petrie\u0027s. No keys in either. He could have gone back and searched Henry Petrie\u0027s pockets, but the thought was too much. He had set off for town at a fast walk, keeping an eye peeled for Jimmy\u0027s Buick. He had been intending to go straight to the Brock Street School when Jimmy\u0027s car came into sight.\n He ran around to the driver\u0027s seat and Mark Petrie was sitting behind the wheel . . . alone. He looked at Ben numbly. His lips worked but no sound came out.\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter? Where\u0027s Jimmy?\u0027\n \u0027Jimmy\u0027s dead,\u0027 Mark said woodenly. \u0027Barlow thought ahead of us again. He\u0027s in the basement of Mrs Miller\u0027s boardinghouse somewhere. Jimmy\u0027s there, too. I went down to help him and I couldn\u0027t get back out. Finally I got a board that I could crawl up, but at first I thought I was going to be trapped down there . . . until s-s-sunset. . . . \u0027\n \u0027What happened? What are you talking about?\u0027\n \u0027Jimmy figured out the blue chalk, you see? While we were at a house in the Bend. Blue chalk. Pool tables. There\u0027s a pool table in the cellar at Mrs Miller\u0027s, it belonged to her husband. Jimmy called the boardinghouse and there was no answer so we drove over.\u0027\n He lifted his tearless face to Ben\u0027s.\n \u0027He told me to look around for a flashlight because the cellar light switch was broken, just like at the Marsten House. So I started to look around. I . . . I noticed that all the knives in the rack over the sink were gone, but I didn\u0027t think anything of it. So in a way I killed him. I did it. It\u0027s my fault, all my fault, all my - \u0027\n Ben shook him: two brisk snaps. \u0027Stop it, Mark. Stop it!\n Mark put his hands to his mouth, as if to catch the hysterical babble before it could flow out. His eyes stared hugely at Ben over his hands.\n At last he went on: \u0027I found a flashlight in the hall dresser, see. And that was when Jimmy fell, and he started to scream. He - I would have fallen, too, but he warned me. The last thing he said was Look out, Mark.\u0027\n \u0027What was it?\u0027 Ben demanded.\n \u0027Barlow and the others just took the stairs away,\u0027 Mark said in a dead, listless voice. \u0027Sawed the stairs off after the second one going down. They left a little more of the railing so it looked like . . . looked like . . .\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027In the dark, Jimmy just thought they were there. You see?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Ben said. He saw. It made him feel sick. \u0027And the knives?\u0027\n \u0027Set all around on the floor underneath,\u0027 Mark whis?pered. \u0027They pounded the blades through these thin ply?wood squares and then knocked off the handles so they would sit flat with the blades pointing . . . pointing.\u0027\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 Ben said helplessly. \u0027Oh, Christ.\u0027 He reached down and took Mark by the shoulders. \u0027Are you sure he\u0027s dead, Mark?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. He . . . he was stuck in half a dozen places. The blood . . . \u0027\n Ben looked at his watch. It was ten minutes of five. Again he had that feeling of being crowded, of running out of time.\n \u0027What are we going to do now?\u0027 Mark asked remotely.\n \u0027Go into town. Talk to Matt on the phone and then talk to Parkins Gillespie. We\u0027ll finish Barlow before dark. We\u0027ve got to.\u0027\n Mark smiled a small, morbid smile. \u0027Jimmy said that, too. He said we were going to stop his clock. But he keeps beating us. Better guys than us must have tried, too.\u0027\n Ben looked down at the boy and got ready to do some?thing nasty.\n \u0027You sound scared,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027I am scared,\u0027 Mark said, not rising to it. \u0027Aren\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m scared,\u0027 Ben said, \u0027but I\u0027m mad, too. I lost a girl I liked one hell of a lot. I loved her, I guess. We both lost Jimmy. You lost your mother and father. They\u0027re lying in your living room under a dust cover from your sofa.\u0027 He pushed himself to a final brutality. \u0027Want to go back and look?\u0027\n Mark winced away from him, his face horrified and hurting.\n \u0027I want you with me,\u0027 Ben said more softly He felt a germ of self-disgust in his stomach. He sounded like a football coach before the big game. \u0027I don\u0027t care who\u0027s tried to stop him before. I don\u0027t care if Attila the Run played him and lost. I\u0027m going to have my shot. I want you with me. I need you.\u0027 And that was the truth, pure and naked.\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 Mark said. He looked down into his lap, and his hands found each other and entwined in distraught pantomime.\n \u0027Dig your feet in,\u0027 Ben said.\n Mark looked at him hopelessly. I\u0027m trying,\u0027 he said.\n 44\n Sonny\u0027s Exxon station on outer Jointner Avenue was open and Sonny James (who exploited his country-music name?sake with a huge color poster in the window beside a pyramid of oil cans) came out to wait on them himself. He was a small, gnome-like man whose receding hair was lawn-mowered into a perpetual crew cut that showed his pink scalp.\n \u0027Hey there, Mr Mears, howya doin\u0027? Where your Citrowan?\u0027\n \u0027Laid up, Sonny. Where\u0027s Pete?\u0027 Pete Cook was Sonny\u0027s part-time help, and lived in town. Sonny did not.\n \u0027Never showed up today. Don\u0027t matter. Things been slow, anyway. Town seems downright dead.\u0027\n Ben felt dark, hysterical laughter in his belly. It threatened to boil out of his mouth in a great and rancid wave.\n \u0027Want to fill it up?\u0027 he managed. \u0027Want to use your phone.\u0027\n \u0027Sure. Hi, kid. No school today?\u0027\n I\u0027m on a field trip with Mr Mears,\u0027 Mark said. \u0027I had a bloody nose.\u0027\n \u0027I guess to God you did. My brother used to get \u0027em. They\u0027re a sign of high blood pressure, boy. You want to watch out.\u0027 He strolled to the back of Jimmy\u0027s car and took off the gas cap\n Ben went inside and dialed the pay phone beside the rack of New England road maps.\n \u0027Cumberland Hospital, which department?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d like to speak with Mr Burke, please. Room 402.\n There was an uncharacteristic hesitation, and Ben was about to ask if the room had been changed when the voice said: \u0027Who is this, please?\u0027\n \u0027Benjaman Mears.\u0027 The possibility of Matt\u0027s death sud?denly loomed up in his mind like a long shadow. Could that be? Surely not - that would be too much. \u0027Is he all right?\u0027\n \u0027Are you a relative?\u0027\n \u0027No, a close friend. He isn\u0027t - \u0027\n \u0027Mr Burke died at 3:07 this afternoon, Mr Mears. If you\u0027d like to hold for just a minute, I\u0027ll see if Dr Cody has come in yet. Perhaps he could . . . \u0027\n The voice went on but Ben had ceased hearing it, although the receiver was still glued to his ear. The realiz?ation of how much he had been depending on Matt to get them through the rest of this nightmare afternoon crashed home with sickening weight. Matt was dead. Congestive heart failure. Natural causes. It was as if God Himself had turned His face away from them.\n Just Mark and I now.\n Susan, Jimmy, Father Callahan, Matt. All gone.\n Panic seized him and he grappled with it silently. He put the receiver back into its cradle without thinking about it, guillotining a question half-asked.\n He walked back outside. It was ten after five. In the west the clouds were breaking up.\n \u0027Comes to just three dollars even,\u0027 Sonny told him brightly. \u0027That\u0027s Doc Cody\u0027s car, ain\u0027t it? I see them MD plates and it always makes me think of this movie I seen, this story about a bunch of crooks and one of them would always steal cars with MD plates because - \u0027\n Ben gave him three one-dollar bills. \u0027I\u0027ve got to split, Sonny. Sorry. I\u0027ve got trouble.\u0027\n Sonny\u0027s face crinkled up. \u0027Gee, I\u0027m sorry to hear that, Mr Mears. Bad news from your editor?\u0027\n \u0027I guess you could say that.\u0027 He got behind the wheel, shut the door, pulled out, and left Sonny looking after him in his yellow foulweather slicker.\n \u0027Matt\u0027s dead, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 Mark asked, watching him.\n \u0027Yes. Heart attack. How did you know?\u0027\n \u0027Your face. I saw your face.\u0027\n It was 5:15.\n 45\n Parkins Gillespie was standing on the small covered porch of the Municipal Building, smoking a Pall Mall and looking out at the western sky. He turned his attention to Ben Mears and Mark Petrie reluctantly. His face looked sad and old, like the glasses of water they bring you in cheap diners.\n \u0027How are You, Constable?\u0027 Ben asked.\n \u0027Tolerable,\u0027 Parkins allowed. He considered a hangnail on the leathery arc of skin that bordered his thumbnail, \u0027Seen you truckin\u0027 back and forth. Looked like the kid was drivin\u0027 up from Railroad Street by hisself this last time. That so?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Mark said.\n \u0027Almost got clipped, Fella goin\u0027 the other way missed you by a whore\u0027s hair.\u0027\n \u0027Constable,\u0027 Ben said, \u0027we want to tell you what\u0027s been happening around here.\u0027 \n Parkins Gillespie spat out the stub of his cigarette with?out raising his hands from the rail of the small covered porch. Without looking at either of them, he said calmly, \u0027I don\u0027t want to hear it.\u0027\n They looked at him dumbfounded.\n \u0027Nolly didn\u0027t show up today,\u0027 Parkins said, still in that calm, conversational voice. \u0027Somehow don\u0027t think he will. He called in late last night and said he\u0027d seen Homer McCaslin\u0027s car out on the Deep Cut Road - I think it was the Deep Cut he said. He never called back in.\u0027 Slowly, sadly, like a man under water, he dipped into his shirt pocket and reached another Pall Mall out of it. He rolled it reflectively between his thumb and finger. \u0027These fucking things are going to be the death of me,\u0027 he said.\n Ben tried again. \u0027The man who took the Marsten House, Gillespie. His name is Barlow. He\u0027s in the basement of Eva Miller\u0027s boardinghouse right now.\u0027\n \u0027That so?\u0027 Parkins said with no particular surprise, \u0027Vam?pire, ain\u0027t he? Just like in all the comic books they used to put out twenty years ago.\u0027\n Ben said nothing. He felt more and more like a man lost in a great and grinding nightmare where clockwork ran on and on endlessly, unseen, but just below the surface of things.\n \u0027I\u0027m leavin\u0027 town,\u0027 Parkins said. \u0027Got my stuff all packed up in the back of the car. I left my gun and the bubble and my badge in on the shelf. I\u0027m done with lawin\u0027. Goin\u0027 t\u0027see my sister in Kittery, I am. Figure that\u0027s far enough to be safe.\u0027\n Ben heard himself say remotely, \u0027You gutless creep. You cowardly piece of shit. This town is still alive and you\u0027re running out on it.\u0027\n \u0027It ain\u0027t alive,\u0027 Parkins said, lighting his smoke with a wooden kitchen match. \u0027That\u0027s why he came here. It\u0027s dead, like him. Has been for twenty years or more. Whole country\u0027s goin\u0027 the same way. Me and Nolly went to a drive-in show up in Falmouth a couple of weeks ago, just before they closed her down for the season. I seen more blood and killin\u0027s in that first Western than I seen both years in Korea. Kids was eatin\u0027 popcorn and cheerin \u0027em on.\u0027 He gestured vaguely at the town, now lying unnaturally gilded in the broken rays of the westering sun, like a dream village. \u0027They prob\u0027ly like bein\u0027 vampires. But not me; Nolly\u0027d be in after me tonight. I\u0027m goin\u0027.\u0027\n Ben looked at him helplessly.\n \u0027You two fellas want to get in that car and hit it out of here,\u0027 Parkins said. \u0027This town will go on without us . . . for a while. Then it won\u0027t matter.\u0027\n Yes, Ben thought. Why don\u0027t we do that? Mark spoke the reason for both of them. \u0027Because he\u0027s bad, mister. He\u0027s really bad. That\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Is that so?\u0027 Parkins said. He nodded and puffed his Pall Mall. \u0027Well, okay.\u0027 He looked up toward the Consolidated High School. \u0027Piss-poor attendance today, from the Lot, anyway. Buses runnin\u0027 late, kids out sick, office phonin\u0027 houses and not gettin\u0027 any answer. The attendance officer called me, and I soothed him some. He\u0027s a funny little bald-headed fella who thinks he knows what he\u0027s doing. Well, the teachers are there, anyway. They come from out of town, mostly. They can teach each other.\u0027\n Thinking of Matt, Ben said, \u0027Not all of them are from out of town.\u0027\n \u0027It don\u0027t matter,\u0027 Parkins said. His eyes dropped to the stakes in Ben\u0027s belt. \u0027You going to try to do that fella up with one of those?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027You can have my riot gun if you want it. That gun, it was Nolly\u0027s idear. Nolly liked to go armed, he did. Not even a bank in town so\u0027s he could hope someone would rob it. He\u0027ll make a good vampire though, once he gets the hang of it.\u0027\n Mark was looking at him with rising horror, and Ben knew he had to get him away. This was the worst of all.\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 he said to Mark. \u0027He\u0027s done.\u0027\n \u0027I guess that\u0027s it,\u0027 Parkins said. His pale, crinkle-caught eyes surveyed the town. \u0027Surely is quiet. I seen Mabel Werts, peekin\u0027 out with her glasses, but I don\u0027t guess there\u0027s much to peek at, today. There\u0027ll be more tonight, likely.\u0027\n They went back to the car. It was almost 5:30.\n 46\n They pulled up in front of St Andrew\u0027s at quarter of six. Lengthening shadows fell from the church across the street to the rectory, covering it like a prophecy. Ben pulled Jimmy\u0027s bag out of the back seat and dumped it out. He found several small ampoules, and dumped their contents out the window, saving the bottles.\n \u0027What are you doing?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re going to put holy water in these,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027Come on.\u0027\n They went up the walk to the church and climbed the steps. Mark, about to open the middle door, paused and pointed. \u0027Look at that.\u0027\n The handle was blackened and pulled slightly out of shape, as if a heavy electric charge had been pushed through it.\n \u0027Does that mean anything to you?\u0027 Ben asked.\n \u0027No. No, but . . . \u0027 Mark shook his head, pushing an unformed thought away. He opened the door and they went in. The church was cool and gray and filled with the endless pregnant pause that all empty altars of faith, white and black, have in common.\n The two ranks of pews were split by a wide central aisle, and flanking this, two plaster angels stood cradling bowls of holy water, their calm and sweetly knowing faces bent, as if to catch their own reflections in the still water.\n Ben put the ampoules in his pocket. \u0027Bathe your face and hands,\u0027 he said.\n Mark looked at him, troubled. \u0027That\u0027s sac - sacri - \u0027\n \u0027Sacrilege? Not this time. Go ahead.\u0027\n They dunked their hands in the still water and then splashed it over their faces, the way a man who has just wakened will splash cold water into his eyes to shock the world back into them.\n Ben took the first ampoule out of his pocket and was filling it when a shrill voice cried, \u0027Here! Here now! What are you doing?\u0027\n Ben turned around. It was Rhoda Curless, Father Calla?han\u0027s housekeeper, who had been sitting in the first pew and twisting a rosary helplessly between her fingers. She was wearing a black dress, and her slip hung below the hem. Her hair was in disarray; she had been pulling her fingers through it.\n \u0027Where\u0027s the Father? What are you doing?\u0027 Her voice was reedy and thin, close to hysteria.\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 Ben asked.\n \u0027Mrs Curless. I\u0027m Father Callahan\u0027s housekeeper. Where\u0027s the Father? What are you doing?\u0027 Her hands came together and began to war with each other.\n \u0027Father Callahan is gone,\u0027 Ben said, as gently as he could. \n \u0027Oh.\u0027 She closed her eyes. \u0027Was he getting after whatever ails this town?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Ben said.\n \u0027I knew it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I didn\u0027t have to ask. He\u0027s a strong, good man of the cloth. There were always those who said he\u0027d never be man enough to fill Father Bergeron\u0027s shoes, but he filled \u0027em. They were too small for him, as it turned out.\u0027\n She opened her eyes wide and looked at them. A tear spilled from her left, and ran down her cheek. \u0027He won\u0027t be back, will he?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Ben said.\n \u0027They talked about his drinkin\u0027,\u0027 she said, as though she hadn\u0027t heard. \u0027Was there ever an Irish priest worth his keep who didn\u0027t tip the bottle? None of that mollycoddlin\u0027 wet-nursin\u0027 church-bingo-prayer-basket for him. He was more\u0027n that!\u0027 Her voice rose toward the vaulted ceiling in a hoarse, almost challenging cry. \u0027He was a priest, not some holy alderman!\u0027\n Ben and Mark listened without speech or surprise. There was no surprise left on this dream-struck day; there was not even the capacity for it. They no longer saw themselves as doers or avengers or saviors; the day had absorbed them. Helplessly, they were only living.\n \u0027Was he strong when last you saw him?\u0027 she demanded, peering at them. The tears magnified the gimlet lack of compromise in her eyes.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Mark said, remembering Callahan in his mother\u0027s kitchen, holding his cross aloft.\n \u0027And are you about his work now?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Mark said again.\n \u0027Then be about it,\u0027 she snapped at them. \u0027What are you waiting for?\u0027 And she left them, walking down the center aisle in her black dress, the solitary mourner at a funeral that hadn\u0027t been held here.\n 47\n Eva\u0027s again - and at the last. It was ten minutes after six. The sun hung over the western pines, peering out of the broken clouds like blood.\n Ben drove into the parking lot and looked curiously up at his room. The shade was not drawn and he could see his typewriter standing sentinel, and beside it, his pile of manuscript and the glass globe paperweight on top of it. It seemed amazing that he could see all those things from here, see them clearly, as if everything in the world was sane and normal and ordered.\n He let his eyes drop to the back porch. The rocking chairs where he and Susan had shared their first kiss stood side by side, unchanged. The door which gave ingress to the kitchen stood open, as Mark had left it.\n \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 Mark muttered. \u0027I just can\u0027t.\u0027 His eyes were wide and white. He had drawn up his knees and was now crouched on the seat.\n \u0027It\u0027s got to be both of us,\u0027 Ben said. He held out two of the ampoules filled with holy water. Mark twitched away from them in horror, as if touching them would admit poison through his skin. \u0027Come on,\u0027 Ben said. He had no arguments left. \u0027Come on, come on.\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Mark?\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 \n \u0027Mark, I need you. You and me, that\u0027s all that\u0027s left.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve done enough!\u0027 Mark cried. \u0027I can\u0027t do any more! \u0027Can\u0027t you understand I can\u0027t look at him?\u0027\n \u0027Mark, it has to be the two of us. Don\u0027t you know that?\u0027\n Mark took the ampoules and curled them slowly against his chest. \u0027Oh boy,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027Oh boy, oh boy.\u0027 He looked at Ben and nodded. The movement of his head was jerky and agonized. \u0027Okay,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Where\u0027s the hammer?\u0027 he asked as they got out.\n \u0027Jimmy had it.\u0027\n \u0027Okay.\u0027\n They walked up the porch steps in the strengthening wind. The sun glared red through the clouds, dyeing every?thing. Inside, in the kitchen, the stink of death was palpable and wet, pressing against them like granite. The cellar door stood open.\n \u0027I\u0027m so scared,\u0027 Mark said, shuddering.\n \u0027You better be. Where\u0027s that flashlight?\u0027\n \u0027In the cellar. I left it when . . . \u0027\n \u0027Okay.\u0027 They stood at the mouth of the cellar. As Mark had said, the stairs looked intact in the sunset light. \u0027Follow me,\u0027 Ben said.\n 48\n Ben thought quite easily: I\u0027m going to my death.\n The thought came naturally, and there was no fear or regret in it. Inward-turning emotions were lost under the overwhelming atmosphere of evil that hung over this place. As he slipped and scraped his way down the board Mark had set up to get out of the cellar, all he felt was an unnatural glacial calm. He saw that his hands were glowing, as if wreathed in ghost gloves. It did not surprise him.\n Let be be finale of seem. The only emperor is the emperor of ice cream. Who had said that? Matt? Matt was dead. Susan was dead. Miranda was dead. Wallace Stevens was dead, too. I wouldn\u0027t look at that, if I were you. But he had looked. That\u0027s what you looked like when it was over. Like something smashed and broken that had been filled with different-colored fluids. It wasn\u0027t so bad. Not so bad as his death. Jimmy had been carrying McCaslin\u0027s pistol; it would still be in his coat pocket. He would take it, and if sunset came before they could get to Barlow . . . first the boy, and then himself. Not good, but better than his death.\n He dropped to the cellar floor and then helped Mark down. The boy\u0027s eyes flashed to the dark, curled thing on the floor and then skipped away.\n \u0027I can\u0027t look at that,\u0027 he said huskily.\n \u0027That\u0027s all right.\u0027\n Mark turned away and Ben knelt down. He swept away a number of the lethal plywood squares, the knife blades thrust through them glittering like dragon\u0027s teeth. Gently, then, he turned Jimmy over.\n I wouldn\u0027t look at that, if I were you.\n \u0027Oh, Jimmy,\u0027 he tried to say, and the words broke open and bled in his throat. He cradled Jimmy in the curve of his left arm and pulled Barlow\u0027s blades out of him with his right hand. There were six of them, and Jimmy had bled a great deal.\n There was a neatly folded stack of living room drapes on a corner shelf. He took them over to Jimmy and spread them over his body after he had the gun and the flashlight and the hammer.\n He stood up and tried the flashlight. The plastic lens cover had cracked, but the bulb still worked. He flashed it around. Nothing. He shone it under the pool table. Bare. Nothing behind the furnace. Racks of preserves, and a pegboard hung with tools. The amputated stairs, pushed over in the far corner so they would be out of sight from the kitchen. They looked like a scaffold leading nowhere.\n \u0027Where is he?\u0027 Ben muttered. He glanced at his watch, and the hands stood at 6:23. When was sunset? He couldn\u0027t remember. Surely no later than 6:55. That gave them a bare half hour.\n \u0027Where is he?\u0027 he cried out. \u0027I can feel him, but where is he?\u0027 \n \"There!\u0027 Mark cried, pointing with one glowing hand. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027\n Ben centered the light on it. A Welsh dresser. \u0027It\u0027s not big enough,\u0027 he said to Mark. \u0027And it\u0027s flush against the wall.\u0027\n \u0027Let\u0027s look behind it.\u0027\n Ben shrugged. They crossed the room to the Welsh dresser and each took a side. He felt a trickle of building excitement. Surely the odor or aura or atmosphere or whatever you wanted to call it was thicker here, more offensive?\n Ben glanced up at the open kitchen door. The light was dimmer now. The gold was fading out of it.\n \u0027It\u0027s too heavy for me,\u0027 Mark panted.\n \u0027Never mind,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027We\u0027re going to tip it over. Get your best hold.\u0027\n Mark bent over it, his shoulder against the wood. His eyes looked fiercely out of his glowing face. \u0027Okay.\u0027\n They threw their combined weight against it and the Welsh dresser went over with a bonelike crash as Eva Miller\u0027s long-ago wedding china shattered inside.\n \u0027I knew it!\u0027 Mark cried triumphantly.\n There was a small door, chest-high, set into the wall where the Welsh dresser had been. A new Yale padlock secured the hasp.\n Two hard swings of the hammer convinced him that the lock wasn\u0027t going to give. \u0027Jesus Christ,\u0027 he muttered softly. Frustration welled up bitterly in his throat. To be balked like this at the end, balked by a five-dollar padlock -\n No. He would bite through the wood with his teeth if he had to.\n He shone the flashlight around, and its beam fell on the neatly hung too] board to the right of the stairs. Hung on two of its steel pegs was an ax with a rubber cover masking its blade. \n He ran across, snatched it off the pegboard, and pulled the rubber cover from the blade. He took one of the ampoules from his pocket and dropped it. The holy water ran out on the floor, beginning to glow immediately. He got another one, twisted the small cap off, and doused the blade of the ax. It began to glimmer with eldritch fairy?light. And when he set his hands on the wooden haft, the grip felt incredibly good, incredibly right. Power seemed to have welded his flesh into its present grip. He stood holding it for a moment, looking at the shining blade, and some curious impulse made him touch it to his forehead. A hard sense of sureness clasped him, a feeling of inevitable rightness, of whiteness. For the first time in weeks he felt he was no longer groping through fogs of belief and unbelief, sparring with a partner whose body was too insubstantial to sustain blows.\n Power, humming up his arms like volts.\n The blade glowed brighter.\n \u0027Do it!\u0027 Mark pleaded. \u0027Quick! Please!\u0027\n Ben Mears spread his feet, slung the ax back, and brought it down in a gleaming arc that left an after-image on the eye. The blade bit wood with a booming, portentous sound and sunk to the haft. Splinters flew.\n He pulled it out, the wood screaming against the steel. He brought it down again . . . again . . . again. He could feel the muscles of his back and arms flexing and meshing, moving with a sureness and a studied heat that they had never known before. Each blow sent chips and splinters flying like shrapnel. On the fifth blow the blade crashed through to emptiness and he began hacking the hole wider with a speed that approached frenzy.\n Mark stared at him, amazed. The cold blue fire had crept down the ax handle and spread up his arms until he seemed to be working in a column of fire. His head was twisted to one side, the muscles of his neck corded with strain, one eye open and glaring, the other squeezed shut. The back of his shirt had split between the straining wings of his shoulder blades, and the muscles writhed beneath the skin like ropes. He was a man taken over, possessed, and Mark saw without knowing (or having to know) that the possession was not in the least Christian; the good was more elemental, less refined. It was ore, like something coughed up out of the ground in naked chunks. There was nothing finished about it. It was Force; it was Power, it was whatever moved the greatest wheels of the universe.\n The door to Eva Miller\u0027s root cellar could not stand before it. The ax began to move at a nearly blinding speed; it became a ripple, a descending arc, a rainbow from over Ben\u0027s shoulder to the splintered wood of the final door.\n He dealt it a final blow and slung the ax away. He held his hands up before his eyes. They blazed.\n He held them out to Mark, and the boy flinched. \u0027I love you,\u0027 Ben said.\n They clasped hands.\n 49\n The root cellar was small and cell-like, empty except for a few dusty bottles, some crates, and a dusty bushel basket of very old potatoes that were sprouting eyes in every direction - and the bodies. Barlow\u0027s coffin stood at the far end, propped up against the wall like a mummy\u0027s sarcophagus, and the crest on it blazed coldly in the light they carried with them like St Elmo\u0027s fire.\n In front of the coffin, leading up to it like railroad ties, were the bodies of the people Ben had lived with and broken bread with: Eva Miller, and Weasel Craig beside her; Mabe Mullican from the room at the end of the second-floor hall; John Snow, who had been on the county and could barely walk down to the breakfast table with his arthritis; Vinnie Upshaw; Grover Verrill.\n They stepped over them and stood by the coffin. Ben glanced down at his watch; it was 6:40.\n \u0027We\u0027re going to take it out there,\u0027 he said. \u0027By Jimmy.\u0027\n \u0027It must weigh a ton,\u0027 Mark said.\n \u0027We can do it.\u0027 He reached out, almost tentatively, and then grasped the upper right corner of the coffin. The crest glittered like an impassioned eye. The wood was crawlingly unpleasant to the touch, smooth and stone-like with years. There seemed to be no pores in the wood, no small imperfections for the fingers to recognize and mold to. Yet it rocked easily. One hand did it.\n He tipped it forward with a small push, feeling the great weight held in check as if by invisible counterweights. Something thumped inside. Ben took the weight of the coffin on one hand.\n \u0027Now,\u0027 he said. \u0027Your end.\u0027\n Mark lifted and the end of the coffin came up easily. The boy\u0027s face filled with pleased amazement. \u0027I think I could do it with one finger.\u0027\n \u0027You probably could. Things are finally running our way. But we have to be quick.\u0027\n They carried the coffin through the shattered door. It threatened to stick at its widest point, and Mark lowered his head and shoved. It went through with a wooden scream.\n They carried it across to where Jimmy lay, covered with Eva Miller\u0027s drapes.\n \u0027Here he is, Jimmy,\u0027 Ben said. \u0027Here the bastard is. Set it down, Mark.\u0027\n He glanced at his watch again. 6:45. Now the light coming through the kitchen door above them was an ashy gray.\n \u0027Now?\u0027 Mark asked.\n They looked at each other over the coffin.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Ben said.\n Mark came around and they stood together in front of the coffin\u0027s locks and seals. They bent together, and the locks split as they touched them, making a sound like thin, snapping clapboards. They lifted.\n Barlow lay before them, his eyes glaring upward.\n He was a young man now, his black hair vibrant and lustrous, flowing over the satin pillow at the head of his narrow apartment. His skin glowed with life. The cheeks were as ruddy as wine. His teeth curved out over his full lips, white with strong streaks of yellow, like ivory.\n \u0027He - \u0027 Mark began, and never finished. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/salem-s-lot/page-20.html","bookId":2573,"book":{"id":2573,"title":"\u0027Salem\u0027s Lot","description":"Storyline: \n Something strange is going on in Jerusalem\u0027s Lot ... but no one dares to talk about it.
