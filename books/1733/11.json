{"id":69431,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"9 January I, Abram Ivanov, finally have a home computer; a word processor, to be exact. I fought it as long as I could. I argued it out with myself. I am America\u0027s most prolific writer and I do fine on a typewriter. Last year I published over thirty books. Some of them were small books for kids. Some were anthologies. But there were also novels, short story collections, essay collections, nonfiction books. Nothing to be ashamed of. So why do I need a word processor? I can\u0027t go any faster. But, you know, there\u0027s such a thing as neatness. Typing my stuff means I have to introduce pen-and-ink items to correct typos, and nobody does that anymore. I don\u0027t want my manuscripts to stick out like a sore thumb. I don\u0027t want editors to think my stuff is second rate, just because it is corrected. The difficulty was finding a machine that wouldn\u0027t take two years to learn to use. Deft, I\u0027m not-as I\u0027ve frequently mentioned in this diary. And I want one that doesn\u0027t break down every other day. Mechanical failures just throw me. So I got one that\u0027s \"fault-tolerant. \" That means if some component goes wrong, the machine keeps right on working, tests the malfunctioning component, corrects it if it can, reports it if it can\u0027t, and replacements can be carried through by anybody. It doesn\u0027t take an expert hacker. Sounds like my kind of thing. 5 February I haven\u0027t been mentioning my word processor lately, because I\u0027ve been struggling to learn how it works. I\u0027ve managed. For a while, I had a lot of trouble, because although I have a high IQ, it\u0027s a very specialized high IQ. I can write, but coping with mechanical objects throws me. But I learned quickly, once I gained sufficient confidence. What did it was this. The manufacturer\u0027s representative assured me that the machine would develop flaws only rarely, and would be unable to correct its own flaws only exceedingly rarely. He said I wouldn\u0027t be likely to need a new component oftener than once in five years. And if I did need one, they would hear exactly what was needed from the machine. The computer would then replace the part itself, do all the wiring and oiling that was necessary and reject the old part, which I could then throwaway. That\u0027s sort of exciting. I almost wish something would go wrong so that I could get a new part and insert it. I could tell everyone, \"Oh, sure, the discombobulator blew a fuse, and I fixed it like a shot. Nothing to it.\" But they wouldn\u0027t believe me. I\u0027m going to try writing a short story on it. Nothing too long. Just about two thousand words, maybe. If I get confused, I can always go back to the typewriter until I\u0027ve regained my confidence. Then I can try again. 14 February I didn\u0027t get confused. Now that the proof is in, I can talk about it. The short story went as smoothly as cream. I brought it in and they\u0027ve taken it. No problem. So I\u0027ve finally started my new novel. I should have started it a month ago, but I had to make sure I could work my word processor first. Let\u0027s hope it works. It\u0027ll seem funny not having a pile of yellow sheets I can rifle through when I want to check something I said a hundred pages earlier, but I suppose I can learn how to check back on the discs. 19 February The computer has a spelling correction component. That caught me by surprise because the representative hadn\u0027t told me about it. At first, it let misspellings go and I just proofread each page as I turned it out. But then it began to mark off any word it was unfamiliar with, which was a little bothersome because my vocabulary is a large one and I have no objection to making up words. And, of course, any proper name I use is something it was unfamiliar with. I called the representative because it was annoying to have to be notified of all sorts of corrections that didn\u0027t really have to be made. The representative said, \"Don\u0027t let that bother you, Mr. Ivanov. If it questions a word that you want to remain as it is, just retype it exactly as it is and the computer will get the idea and not correct it the next time.\" That puzzled me. \"Don\u0027t I have to set up a dictionary for the machine? How will it know what\u0027s right and what\u0027s wrong?\" \"That\u0027s part of the fault-tolerance, Mr. Ivanov,\" he said. \"The machine already has a basic dictionary and it picks up new words as you use them. You will find that it will pick up false misspellings to a smaller and smaller degree. To tell you truthfully, Mr. Ivanov, you have a late model there and we\u0027re not sure we know all its potentialities. Some of our researchers consider it fault-tolerant in that it can continue to work despite its own flaws, but fault-intolerant in that it won\u0027t stand for flaws in those who use it. Please report to us if there\u0027s anything puzzling. We would really like to know.\" I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll like this. 7 March Well, I\u0027ve been struggling with the word processor and I don\u0027t know what to think. For a long time, it would mark off misspellings, and I would retype them correctly. And it certainly learned how to tell real misspellings. I had no trouble there. In fact, when I had a long word, I would sometimes throw in a wrong letter just to see if it would catch it. I would write \"supercede\" or \"vaccum\" or \"Skenectady.\" It almost never failed. And then yesterday a funny thing happened. It stopped waiting for me to retype the wrong spelling. It retyped it automatically itself. You can\u0027t help striking the wrong key sometimes so I would write \" She\" instead of \"the\" and the \" 5\" would change to a \"t\" in front of my eyes. And it would happen quickly, too. I tested it by deliberately typing a word with a wrong letter. I would see it show up wrong on the screen. I would blink my eyes and it would be right. This morning I phoned the representative. \"Hmm,\" he said. \"Interesting.\" \"Troublesome,\" I said, \"it might introduce mistakes. If I type \u0027blww\u0027 does the machine correct it to \u0027blew\u0027 or to \u0027blow\u0027? Or what if it thinks I mean \u0027blue,\u0027 \u0027ue\u0027 when I really mean \u0027blew,\u0027 \u0027ew.\u0027 See what I mean?\" He said, \"I have discussed your machine with one of our theoretical experts. He tells me it may be capable of absorbing internal clues from your writing and knows which word you really want to use. As you type into it, it begins to understand your style and integrate it into its own programming.\" A little scary, but it\u0027s convenient. I don\u0027t have to proofread the pages now. 20 March I really don\u0027t have to proofread the pages. The machine has taken to correcting my punctuation and word order. The first time it happened, I couldn\u0027t believe it. I thought I had had a small attack of dizziness and had imagined I had typed something that wasn\u0027t really on the screen. It happened oftener and oftener and there was no mistake about it. It got to the point where I couldn\u0027t make a mistake in grammar. If I tried to type something like \"Jack, and Jill went up the hill,\" that comma simply wouldn\u0027t appear. No matter how I tried to type \"I has a book,\" it always shows up as \"I have a book.\" Or if I wrote, \"Jack, and Jill as well, went up the hill,\" then I couldn\u0027t omit the commas. They\u0027d go in of their own accord. It\u0027s a lucky thing I keep this diary in longhand or I couldn\u0027t explain what I mean. I couldn\u0027t give an example of wrong English. I don\u0027t really like to have a computer arguing with me over English, but the worst part of it is that it\u0027s always right. Well, look, I don\u0027t throw a fit when a human copy editor sends me back a manuscript with corrections in every line. I\u0027m just a writer, I\u0027m not an expert on the minutiae of English. Let the copy editors copyedit, they still can\u0027t write. And so let the word processor copyedit. It takes a load off me. 17 April I spoke too soon in the last item in which I mentioned my word processor. For three weeks, it copyedited me and my novel went along smoothly. It was a good working arrangement. I did the creating and it did the modulating, so to speak. Then yesterday evening, it refused to work at all. Nothing happened, no matter what keys were touched. It was plugged in all right; the wall switch was on; I was doing everything correctly. It just wouldn\u0027t work. Well I thought, so much for that business about \"Not once in five years.\" I\u0027d only been using it for three and a half months and already so many parts were out that it wouldn\u0027t work. That meant that new parts ought to come from the factory by special messenger, but not till the next day, of course. I felt terrible, you can bet, and I dreaded having to go back to the typewriter, searching out all my own mistakes and then having to make pen-and-ink corrections or to retype the page. I went to bed in a foul humor, and didn\u0027t actually sleep much. First thing in the morning, or, anyway, after breakfast, I went into my office, and just as I walked up to the word processor, as though it could read my mind and tell that I was so annoyed I would cheerfully have kicked it off the desk and out the window-it started working. All by itself, mind you. I never touched the keys. The words appeared on the screen a lot more quickly than I could have made them appear and it began with: Fault-Intolerant by Abram Ivanov I simply stared. It went on to write my diary items concerning itself, as I have done above, but much better. The writing was smoother, more colorful, with a successful touch of humor. In fifteen minutes, it was done, and in five minutes the printer had placed it on sheets. That apparently had just been for exercise, or for practice, for once that was done, the last page I had written of my novel appeared on the screen, and then the words began to proceed without me. The word processor had clearly learned to write my stuff, just as I would have written it, only better. Great! No more work. The word processor wrote it under my name and wrote with my style, given a certain amount of improvement. I could just let it go, pick up the surprised reviews from my critics telling the world how I had improved, and watch the royalties pour in. That\u0027s all right as far as it goes, but I\u0027m not America\u0027s most prolific writer for no reason. I happen to love to write. That happens to be all that I want to do. Now if my word processor does my writing, what do I do with the rest of my life?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gold-the-final-science-fiction-collection/page-11.html","bookId":1733,"book":{"id":1733,"title":"Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection","description":"Storyline: Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection by Isaac Asimov, Orson Scott Card (Introduction) Gold is the final and crowning achievement of the fifty-year career of science fiction\u0027s transcendent genius, the world-famous author who defined the field of science fiction for its practitioners, its millions of readers, and the world at large.
